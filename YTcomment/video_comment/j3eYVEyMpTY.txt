Looks soo goood
I make my oatmeal mix...no sugar. Quick oats, PB fit powder, raisins, unsweetened coconut, and goji berries. Just add water.
New subbie here!!
... but.. five days is not a week, 7 days is a week.
Obviously, seven years later you are not gonna get all that for $20. 35 maybe. Fucking Walmart I don’t support them and if we keep supporting them eventually there will be no other choice but Walmart. Think about that one.
i love how you didn’t go over the $20 budget like some other ppl. you made it so realistic! also i love how protein focused it can be for cheap!
I can't eat beans legumes chickpeas
Thowback to 2017 when you get smoked tofu for 2.50 😅
Regular oats take 2 minutes in the microwave.
You are so creative!
If you haven’t already, you should update this for 2023
Great ideas! Although food without onion and garlic for me is plain😅
6 years later it's quite saddening to see how much prices have risen.
Man this is 5 years ago, things have🤔 changed now for sure.
Great  video very creative work .  Keep going..👍
Great value 🤣
Thanks Cheaplazyvegan!  Being a vegan seemed hopeless.   I can’t eat wheat, corn, dairy and strongly dislike eating meat.  Going out for dinner = hard to find an option both vegetarian, dairy free, corn free and gluten free.  I eat rice. lentils and veggies eat too often.  Plus juicing and times of vitamins & smoothies.   I even started eating chicken slices sometimes squeamishly since all pre-made grocery store meat substitutes have wheat and i need high protein sandwich for fast food.    I just don’t have the energy for 2hrs of cooking a night with my disability.   Sometimes, not always.  Being a vegan seemed hopeless…  So, you are teaching me.  prep ahead.  seasoning mixes.  air fryer. I’m already planning to make 3 kimbap and vegan lasagna this week.    Thanks!
Nutritionally, you did an amazing job on this - especially with zero planning! Plenty of colors: green, yellow, red, black; healthy whole-grain carbs; high protein with the beans, tofu and pasta; potassium, calcium and digestible fat from the bananas; bonuses: cholesterol-reducing oatmeal and catabolic broccoli. And prep was progressive, portion-controlled and quick and easy, preserving nutrients with minimal cooking time. Lucky you, my WM doesn't mark down produce in $1 bags. That broccoli was truly beautiful, too! You could have further stretched the budget by choosing dried beans, and I would have liked to see some orange fruit/veg and keto substitutions, but this is absolutely awesome! ^5 This video being done in 2016, I'd like to see how far $20 goes in the 2022 economy. <3 :-)
My instant oatmeal lasts forever because I never eat it 😅
If i eat porridge for breakfast, I'm usually hungry 30 mins later......
Super interesting!  I often look at smoked tofu and never take the leap lol...  So, next time I see some on the shelves, I'm definitely going to buy some.  BTW, you are very entertaining!  All the best from Montreal QC!  :)
Hi Rose. Soy sauce is okay no worries
To thicken any of the sauces without adding extra ingredients, take a small amount of cooked rice or pasta and food process/blend it with a little water before adding it to your simmering dishes. It isn't quite as effective as a cornstarch slurry, but it will help watery sauces to have a smoother/richer texture.
€13,81...
I'm new to being vegan. Is soy good or not? Seems to be a lot of opposing view points.
Wow thats like R1,50 in south africa. You can buy nada nevermind one meal nevermind one week...!
you are great
Terrible!
I don't think wal mart had any vegan food...
I tried this and it was kinda gross. I guess vegan isn't for me sadly. Might try a different meal prep idea and give it one more chance.
I like my oatmeal with milk.
$20 per week for a vegan meal plan is very do-able.  I spent $24 yesterday, and I'm all set.
Guys. lost lots of weight doesn't need to be hard (I used to feel it did). I'm going to give you some advice now. Look for a popular diet plan program called Okibetonic Secrets (just search it on google). Thanks to it I have lost crazy amounts of weight. I should not even be speaking about it cause I do not want a bunch of other guys out there running the same game but whatever. I'm just simply in a excellent mood right now so I will share the wealth lol.
It's so unbelievable to see as a German how much plastic American supermarkets are using😳 So shocking
I buy reduced fresh fruits and veggies all the time. Cook immediately and either freeze or can them for later. ❤ (I've of $900 a month...not by choice)
Raw spinach🤢
Anybody tested out the Okibetonic Secrets (search on google)? We have noticed numerous awesome things about this popular fat burn methods.
OMG. I already have some of those ingredients from the church.
Loved it ♥️ and the meals look great! I love how resourceful you are
dont you get bored of it lol i like variety still good if ur broke
What can you use if you hate tofu?
Always get awesome ideas from you.
Anyone tried the Custokebon Secrets (do a google search)? We have noticed several awesome things about this popular weight loss secrets.
Regular old fashioned oats are way cheaper and healthier. I have old fashioned oats everyday since the pandemic to save money.
Thank you good video
Instant packets are the gateway oatmeal
Lets go Canada
Love the meal prep vids!! Can we have dinner meal preps videos? My partner and I aren't big on breakfast or lunch but we're big fans of a good dinner!! Thank you, keep up the good work!
How much are Walmart had a reduced pile of produce products like that
I love it, will try the challenge as well.
I just bought smoked tofu so I'm anxious to see what you do with it!
What is the best product or brand to lost a lot of weight? I read many good opinions on the net about how exactly Custokebon Secrets can assist you lost a ton of fat. Has anyone tested out this popular fat burn method?
So $40 US... because I’m thinking about one whole pay period and I get paid once every two weeks. Gonna try this soon.
yummy, yummy, I love eating vegan food
Explore local fruit and vegetable markets if you live near them.  Our local shop routinely marks down perfectly good produce to make way for the freshest items.  If you’re making pots of veggie soup, this is a jackpot.
Drinking game:  take a shot every time she says “like.”
I wish you had cut up your spinach in the pasta salad
I wouldn't want to eat so much of the same thing day after day. Though...I already do that 😹 At the moment it's peanut satay tofu with brown rice and capsicum and spinach, then cauliflower & broccoli soup, hummus (xD) and wraps. I made a LOT of thatnstuff a few days ago and there's no more freezer room 😹😹 (I live in a share house and honestly take up 1/2 ish of the freezer anyway. 2 of the 3 other housemates don't want to use the fridge or freezer much though. Weird rant ended
Hello! Thank you for this helpful video. By the way, I notice many people keep on talking about Custokebon Secrets (look on google search engine), but I'm not sure if it's good. Have you thought about Custokebon Secrets? I've heard many awesome things about it and my mate lost tons of weight with it, but she refuses to tell me :(
Thanks for this
You're so cute!!
You did so well with the amount of items you purchased for $20. Your Canadian $ is pretty similar to our Australian dollar but I think it could be hard to buy all of those items here in Australia for $20.
Yum
Great idea. Thanks!
Cost me $26.16 because I had to do a few substitutions due to things not being available like no bananas so I got 2lb grapes no corn had to get mixed veg don’t like mustard had to get vegan ranch but if I didn’t get the ranch and just skipped it all together and used oil and vinegar and seasonings it would have been pretty close to $21 (Whole Foods prices from amazon fresh) and if they had bananas would have saved a few dollars too
corona virus chickpea shortage at Walmart grrrrrrrrr
Why don’t they just include tax in the product and make everyone’s life easier ?
I hate it when people do this - prep on a budget and drive to the shops. If you drive, you have to include your petrol at least (if not a fraction of your tax, insurance, MOT, et cetera) as this is part of the cost you're taking on and why cheap challenges are not as hard as actually being poor. And of course, this still doesn't account for other access barriers like time, facilities, power costs, but I think on a weekly basis, petrol should at least be a core essential factor.
Thanks im a new vegan this helped me a lot!
can you eat.cheese.peanut.
wow, this was a really great video and you did a wonderful job on making it! so proud!!:))
Wow this is amazing great job!
Too much talking😊✌
Love it.... looks just like my life.... thanks
You increase by faith in humanity.
I work at walmart and that dollar bag is illegal lmao! We definitely arent supposed to do that but I wish we could because it just gets thrown out otherwise!
Yaaaas we love a humble Walmart vegan queen 😍😍😍💗💗💗💗 it's honestly so much more motivating than watching vegans who only shop at whole foods or trader Joe's. I can't afford those places all the time. Thank you for your videos!!!💗💗💗💗💗
so here are the actual prep instructions:   Breakfast - each morning     Instant Oatmeal with Banana Slices     FOOD PREPPING STARTS AT 6:43      Cook Brown Rice  Cook Pasta  Cut up broccoli into smaller pieces and cook  Wash spinach if needed and dry  Chop up smoked tofu into bite sized pieces     EASY AF PASTA SALAD RECIPE - 8:08  Mix penne pasta, spinach,  chickpeas, some stuffed olives maybe some corn, too, use dijon mustard as a dressing, mix and put in container     PASTA + TOMATOES + BEANS + VEG - 9:32     Add canned tomatoes, chickpeas, and corn to a pan and heat, add salt to taste, add some of the smoked tofu and some spinach to the pan, cook until sauce thickens     Put pasta, olives, and broccoli in a container, then add some of the cooked sauce over the top     TACO RICE BOWL - 10:58     Add rinsed black beans into remainder of pasta sauce from above, add some more corn, plus some of the to seasoning mix     Put rice and some broccoli into a container and add more of the remaining sauce over the top     RICE + SMOKED TOFU + VEG MIX - 11:50     Cook up remainder of smoked tofu in a pan. Add in some broccoli, black beans and any remaining corn.     Put rice in a container and add this over the top.
I love your hair! The bright colors suit you so well! Really makes me want to try something like that :)
hey luvs, just wanna say if you're trying to lose weight oat meal is not the go to, oat meal is good for keeping you at a consistent weight
Thanks for this- I basically copied you from what I had on hand with a few substitutions!
This is excellent. I have all of these things in my house except for the smoked tofu. I have regular tofu so I will improvise. Oh and no bananas. But I have frozen fruits. I make my own seasoning mix cuz I’m a tight wad...lol. So I will shop my pantry instead of going out. Especially with a pandemic happening. Thanks, Rose. I’m over sixty so I could get really sick.
Loved it. Looks sooooo good! Ima try the easy as f**** Pasta 1st lol
I pretty much have all these ingredients 😂minus the corn so defentilly making for next week
Coming back to this two years later than when I first saw it to prepare for my layoff/quarantine for the coronavirus
Great value
There's no cheaper way to eat healthy. In Germany l wouldn't need 20 euro shopping by aldi. I would also buy potatoes and carrots and some other fruits for variety.
What a shame that the link to the shopping list is broken.
"I recommend this guide: *phip.best/vegan/cEX* So grateful it exists in 2020."
Awesome looks yummy  But if you are new to this style of eating  then too much fiber can cause bad expanded tummy bloat can you do one of these for new Vegan peps? to easy them into it? thank you for your hard work keeping this video real and just 20$ : )
Reminds me of my college days when I was broke af 😂 I spent all my money on booze & rent. I had like $25 left for groceries. And honest to God made these same recipes lmao.
As a European vegan, freaked about the amount of plastic 😱
Loved this! I have one handy money saving tip,, make regular oatmeal in bulk & freeze individual servings Just measure out 3/4ths cup of water per serving & add 1/2  of a cup of oats per serving. This will be thick & lumpy, thaw the night before & add hot water and your favorite mix-ins just before serving! I like to use the plastic bowls from the instant pho.
Yess finally a Canadian one I can actually relate to
you had me at cheap and lazy lol
can't wait to try this! THANKS
Your link to the foods that you bought is not working. Is anyone else having this issue?
YES THE SMOKED TOFU TASTES LIKE HAM !!!!!! hahaha
I was worried for a min... but seeing this, you did a good job.
Aldi is great for produce
Transinitioning vegan never tried tofu can someone tell me if it taste good or what to except please thank you 🧐
Bland food flavoured with salt . I get the purpose of the video but really not inspiring to make . It’s more targeted to poor uncreative students on little money. Sorry but not a great vid
Thank you for making this simple! I plan on changing my way of eating due to health issues.
I love your videos 😁
🔥🔥🔥💯
Nice 👍 video! Here is a tip. The big can of  Oats (great value brand) is a lot cheaper than packaged instant ones..plus you can add peanut butter and banana to it for flavor and other fruits. It always lasts me a little over a month. A lot longer than the packets of oats
In to veganism buys oats in little plastic packets!
How high is all the sodium
Lazy AND disgusting!
Talked way too long about oat meal

That broccoli was an absolute DEAL
Instant oatmeal has too much sugar. Otherwise anyone not considering her as a SO is foolish.
I am gonna try this but whit 50 euro,s. Cause in the Netherlands its a little bit more expensive. I love this meal prep. And i love you,re hair colour. Red realy looks good on you 😊😁👋🏼👍🏼
That exact tofu is $6 at my neighborhood grocery store 😮 I will keep my eye out at Walmart! I really like that tofu!
CHEAP! LAZY! vegan,  I watch this channel to learn what not to do. There are plenty of Prison Chefs who have no money and  can come up with better meals in PRISON. yikes!
Rice with the pasta👌🍝
5 days? I only see 4 meals and a bag of instant oatmeals.
Not sure if it taste like ham just bc I haven't had it lol. But it definitely looks like ham I think
i love your energy!  great video too
Going to different stores doesn't make it under $20 when you add the gas :)
Love it !! Thank you
Beautiful haircolor! And thank you for inspiration! Like your videos so much!
Excuse my ignorance, but Canada has Walmart!?!? Sorry, I just thought canada would do better lol
This was nice. Thank you.
I am inspired!! You rule!!! I wish food were so cheap in America :( :(
Ur a freakin cutie omg ugh 😍
That’s nasty
You could of got a huge container of oats that would of lasted way longer for about the same price
is it just me or did she only have six meals there...
I think you’re incredible. You are one of the best vegan YouTubers I follow. Keep up the good work, love.
Could you do a meal prep for 2?
U did end up getting the broccoli yay 😋 Awesome video thanks u so much
I hate that penne pasta almost spells like penis in Spanish and it actuality sounds like penis in Spanish
You remembered me when i first started cooking veg, it was the kind of meals i was doing. Simple, filling. Good. I've always been a very organized person, so it made sense to prep in advance , it helps not eating crap on the go cause...there's a LOT of transformed products for veg people out there, not healthy at all. 20 years later, i'm 46, i am still prepping all my weekly meals in advance, but now of course i'm more aware that cheap sometimes does lack a few nutrients. So i'd say i spend around 40$ a week for my food, and i'm eating really really well. Thanks to Bulk Barn who came here recently, it even got better. I buy my staples in a bulk there: redstar yeast ( everyday to supplement in b12 ) natural steel cut oats ( that i cook on the oven with my desired flavors in advance for 5 days, and i just add a little liquid to eat when i reheat it ) 3 color quinoa, quinoa flakes ( for my homemade granola bars ), wild rice, oat bran ( everyday in a yogourt for regularity) and all my gluten free pasta. I love Bulk Barn.... All the rest are fresh or frozen( those make you save a LOT of money)  veggies and fruits that i get weekly. I'm lucky cause during all summer-fall season, we have community fridges ( 4 in my city) were farms and grocery stores put all their unsold and left over veggies and other products FOR FREE. There's also bread, and dairy in there very often.  I adapt all my recipes with what i found in the fridges, my stock at home , and i buy the rest on sale, and i cook only with what's on sale NOT what i want to cook. I also use an app that gives you recipes with your leftovers. That's how i do on a budget and it gets my creativity going. Right now there's a lot of veggies on sale, it's time to do some canning as well, or dehydrate any veggies or fruits for snacks ( i use a machine, a great investement)  Trees have apples all over the streets, nature is generous in fall. In winter, then, i don't have my magic fridge so i really stick to the cheapest place that offers the fresh products. When some veggies are about to go bad, you can totally get a rebate in most groceries if you ask, i do it all the time. They put a 30% or 50% sticker on it. You can even ask if they can GIVE you veggies they're about to throw away if you have the guts. I do it sometimes , just before they close, it's a small place, very friendly. They are even happy to do it since they would throw it away. People are nicier than we think. You can also join or create a community kitchen where vegetarians or vegans cook all together their food for the week, to save even more and have fun. YES it's an extra effort to prep but i'm glad to choose my health.I used to suffer from anorexia, and...the only positive thing that's left from that terrible illness is my gratefulness for healthy food, and a bit of an obsession for it. That's common but it's nothing at all compared to being like i used to.  It's fun to cook, i also wanna love the taste and not only eat it because it's healthy , i'm feeling grateful really. But it's very important to have all the basics in your meals, to get all the nutrients, and to supplement. I supplement vitamin D all year long, and i get the rest from my Red Star. I do blood tests every 6 months to be sure, and since i'm not a vegan, anymore ( i used to but i became sick ) i have fish, eggs, and small amounts of lactose free dairy ( i'm intolerant to gluten and lactose ) in my diet. Voilà! You're doing good girl, you're on the right track . Ps: love your hair
6:35 to get straight to food prep 😘
I like the concept of this video but there's a ton of super processed foods there. Too much to work for me personally.
Rolled oats+ water+ salt+ heat = porridge. You can add dried fruit, nuts, seeds, fresh fruit and plant milk if you want to be fancy, but porridge is pretty basic and very cheap. Loving your video and ideas btw, I just have children who will only eat the sachets of instant flavoured porridge and it is a pet peeve, so totally my bias.
i only seen 2 days of meals, not one week
I literally buy smoked tofu for our Easter dinners because it's the closest to ham!
Yas a Canadian doing this! I shop at Walmart too, it's hard when I see YouTubers shopping at American stores!
That grocery cart sounded like a loud war tank😆
The broccoli bag was inside another bag?
Do people realize that chemical type preservatives are not good at all for you! Fresh, frozen or dried is healthy! Preservatives, dyes, regular sugars, iodized salts, bleached flours, and animal proteins are hugely related to getting cancers and damaging your own body organs!
Wow!  Excellent ideas!  Yummy looking nutritious meals!
do you mean 5 meals or food for 5 days? that isnt 3 meals a day though?
Clever healthy cooking ! Nice job.
Pasta has eggs in it
I didnt know that the 20 dollars looked like that!?!? Its got the queen of england on it. The vlogs are amazing keep it up.
Couldn't I just put a few drops of liquid smoke in the tofu and call it smoked? I thought so. Thanks.
Great video. I’ve been looking for more healthy options for lunch. Your recipes look so quick and easy.
I eat all that in a day
Its not a hate comment but i just dislike that people say week and then say 5 day. A wEeK iS 7 DaYSsSsSsS!!!!😂
Thank you Cheap Lazy Vegan (CLV for short).  Not only have you proven that one can AFFORD to eat vegan but also it is NOT as time-consuming as one would think.  BTW, I loved the way you "cooked" the fresh broccoli!  :-D
I like your video, but you talk too much at the beggining of the video... 1min headache start. Go straight to the point 🤦🏻‍♂️😉
That oatmeal looks disgusting lol  😂 I’ll make my own
2019 is better, i can buy all this stuff or only the small price of 40 usd :) great thing i live in a good country now let me go get a salad and a steak for much cheaper, also these small portions are not gonna be enough for me to last a whole week so make it like 60 USD on the starving end, why the heck would i destroy my body.... also its better for the animals :) cause if we stop eating them they will go extinct and replaced by crop farms
I’m sure this is motivating a decent amount of people out there. Thank you for posting this. You’re great!
Thanks for sharing! Please do not use God’s name in vain. He loves us dearly💜
Wait. Do Americans put reduced stuff in even more plastic?
Wouldn't it have been far more cost effective to buy dried beans. You could make more with them and they only take about an hour to make.
Awesome video!  I don't like to eat from cans cuz of yr aluminum taste and not the healthiest but frozen would be a good alternative.  Great recipes and money saving tips!  Thx
Clean your kitchen first before you start coking
Lol hey don’t knock it when I first went vegan I did not know what oat was let alone how to cook one. Still dont know how to cook much which is why I ended up at your channel
You are fantastic.
Does veganism really make you lose weight because if so i would like to try it. I’ve been struggling with high protein diets...
In case anyone wants it in a list Instant oatmeal  Bananas  Corn  Broccoli  Baby Spinach  Penne Pasta Diced tomatoes  Chick peas Dijon mustard  Olives Black beans Brown rice Smoked Tofu Taco seasoning
I miss eating tofu, I cant really have it while pregnant but at some point I'll enjoy it again.
You are hilarious!  Love the Walmart and Loblaws reduced rack. [Oatmeal banana pancakes : 1/2 cup rolled oats, 1/2 cup plant based milk, 1/2 frozen banana, splash vanilla, some cinnamon powder and 1 tsp baking powder.  Add everything to a Magic Bullet and blend until smooth. Fry in nonstick pan.  Cheap and fast! ] Buy $1 reduced bananas, peel and freeze.  I like to shred the smoked tofu on a cheese grater.  My Loblaws prices are prohibitive. Giant Tiger just down the street is UberCheap!
It starts at 6:44
isnt that leather interior in your car?..... vegan?
Cool video! For the pasta salad, is there anything you'd recommend as a good flavour substitution for those of us who aren't too fond of olives? :P
Hi. Just wondering, where do you get your omega 3 & other vit's., from?
Your fucking link of everything you bought gave my phone a virus .....
Can groats be dried in the oven? I don't own a dehydrator and am unable to buy one at this time.
What a great voice ... cool meal ideas too!
that broccoli is a steal! idk why there's no reduced prices like that in my home country. that bag of broccoli is gonna cost me like 8 dollars at least in my home country. the spinach is a steal too!
I think u are creating a healthy economical  diet revolution 👍.. following this..
Thank you so much! I just tried out your recipe and it’s hitting the spot right now. 💕
Also, and f you have a bruised banana, just mash up, top with instant oatmeals, microwave. Yummy.
Love your videos. Only thing is, I would not have done instant oat meal, just because of price difference in a canister of oatmeal for those on budget, but we need convenience every now and then. Awesome video.
I am not vegan. $20 a week is hard to do under any circumstances. I like variety, not eating the same Foods everyday. I think you did a great job money-wise and variety wise.
The water from the canned chickpeas can be used to do vegan merengues. This could be a great dessert option and budget should stay the same!!!
Are your food items taxed?
hey, i just tried much things to be more healthy and i really can recommend this ebook, take a look on their website to become a view about it if youre intereseted https://www.digistore24.com/redir/56501/Dqvee_/
The only real issue with this is re-using so many of the same ingredients, everything might taste a bit the same. But honestly, this is an amazing job and really impressive. I learned something today!
Looks good I can't eat tomatoes though but good meal ideas!
That was awesome thank you.
But it’s different though in malaysia the healthier the pricier😭
You ain’t microwave that oatmeal? And you’re supposed to use the packet to measure the water. The line is on there
I thought it was 7 days... but ok I'll take this
Thank you! I live with my family and it’s hard to try to eat vegan when their groceries are not vegan friendly.
Hi I know you do these vegan meals and i know you like little mix because i saw a comment on eat in with little mix and i was thinking "please do a little mix vid " you probley now alot so please i am not forcing you to do it its just an idear
😂 Im broke af, gonna do groceries in a week stumbled upon your channel and video! Very helpful...sadly PuertoRico has a... bout...20% inflation rate on everything imported and agronomy is on a huge downfall... But! Helpful video :) you’re funny+Cute
It's all great but sooooooooooo much plastic packaging. Guess you can't have both :(
Fantastic! I learnt something new about the Broccoli. So impresseD-D-D! (-:
You made almost a weeks worth of food with $20. Me & my girlfriend barley have food left when we spend $200
Wait, I don't get how the eating is spaced out? It's one container per day?
Please read this as polite rather than nasty because i dont want it to come across as nasty. Please do a 7 day meal prep. Almost every time i click on a $20/$10/$35 etc week long meal plan video it ends up being only 4-5 days worth when i actually watch it (you are definitely not the only one who does this but it makes my ocd twitchy). Please make one that actually is a full week. Even if it means cooking twice in the video its more honest to the name of the video.
Loved this video!! Super helpful considering I’m at university!! Thank you so much
plain tofu is a $1-1.50 a block, super cheap protein! Throw it in with some pasta, veggies, sauce and spices and thats a huge meal! for cheap. I spend less then $5 on 6 servings of food this way
Not judging you but I feel like Walmart is anti vegan.
This was awesome!!! Okay this is my first time seeing your channel, as a recent vegetarian I had no reason to look at it before.  Seriously though, I love meal prepping and you made it look so easy
Boiling broccoli in water takes all the nutrients out. Its better to steam your vegetables.
Wow thanks! Just got all of the ingredients I'm so excited to try out
Is it common in the US to go to the supermarket by car? Here in Europe (at least in urban areas) we typically go by foot or by bike.
This is so awesome!  I am doing it next week!  I really enjoy your videos.
I love how practical and real these recipients are. Ain’t no one got the time & money to make a gourmet meal every night.
video starts @7:23
I like my oatmeal soupy too
Nothing short of genius. Right here.
I liked when I stopped buying stupid bread all the time and put 4 cups bread flower 1tp salt 1tp baking powder 1/2 cup olive milk 1/2 cup water and cook 375 35 mins loaf of bread ,I don't know how I lived before that
Looks delicious.. I think it's ok to use what u already have.. But I love watching your video.. I get so hungry.. Thx
Thank you so much
here I am eating pb and j and an apple for lunch to save money lol totally gonna try the pasta salad recipe
This is amazing giiirl! Thanks for sharing!!!
Amazing!
You're awesome
How many euros are that?
20$ is a Elizabeth 2 on it ? Lol 🤣🤣🤣
there's no way all that cost $20, also no way that's enough calories for a week.
be careful wit flavored instant oatmeal and taco mixes, they sneak milk in some brands
These recipes are so clever! Also, you're so cute omg!!!!!
Really like this video. I have been trying to make a change on my eating habits but the husband and kids are not all the way in. So this $20 shopping is great for just myself. Can you please make more videos like this??!! P. S. I love your channel ❤️ wish I had a vegan Korean bff
Very nice, showing how easy it easy to eat vegan!
That tofu looks AWFUL
That taco sauce thing you made was genius
I'm trying to use USD$30 to $40/2 weeks on groceries. Hopefully I can accomplish this!
love the hair and the tips! so grateful for a CAD video! where are you from?
Have you lived in Georgia? You do a great Southern accent? People from England can do a Southern accent but people from up North can’t. Are you in the British part of Canada?
Loved this gotta try!
I know this video is really old by now but do you shop at Bulk Barn?  I tried quinoa by buying it on Amazon. LOVED it. So I tried some from Bulk Barn and it was so much cheaper. Same with the dried beans and the spices. I'm so happy to see a Canadian vegan with ideas, so many people are in the US and we don't have the same stores and the prices are so different.
So many plastic containers....
A bit few vegetables in my opinion.. And no fruits except the bananas. :/  But ok, it was a challenge. I think 20,- for 5 days can at least not provide a well-balanced nutrition/diet. So spend some dollars more and buy more fruits+vegetables..
As a non vegan peeking in the window here, it amazes me that this stuff looks great. I'm sure once I got used to it these meals would seem satisfying, but to me right now all I'm thinking is WHERES THE PIZZA WHERE'S THE SUBS. I have a ways to go, hah.
The amount of plastic is alarming
I think you should have bought a bag of black beans instead of can.
Hey! I just came back from the super market here in Puerto Rico and bought exactly what you bought but I bought two enormous avocados, three extra bananas and 4 beans for only 25.36!! I thought it was really cheap!! Thank you for the help even tho is an old video lol 🙏🏼🙏🏼
I'm from Kansas and at 11:45 I felt right at home with that accent 😂 Edit: also at 12:41
That is very creative, especially the smoked tofu. I'm impressed that you didn't even plan it ahead. The only thing is that if I ate beans and broccoli every day, I wouldn't be able to leave the house all week without embarrassment, if you get my drift.
I make $20 a month because of school
Great video!
Drinking water with really is bad! There’s a reason we’re encouraged to add milk to our cereal. Even almond milk has fortified nutrients that water doesn’t have. If you can afford it then please have your cereal with milk.
This is great!  It's amazing how healthily a person can eat on very little money.
you have the bowls my parents have! lol
I'm going to try  $80 for the month of  February, and do very similar  dishes, love the chick pea tofu, I use chick pea pasta too.
sorry to see you shop al walmart. while trying to be conscience of being cruelty free you just negated half of your work by shopping at one of the cruelest institutions on the planet.  i personally would rather dumpster dive than pass through the doors of that truly EVIL,EVIL, place. ! i like you. i hope you reconsider your sources. xoxo   : )
Love your video but please turn down your music...I have to keep turning it up to hear your soft sweet voice, then turn it down when the music starts! Great job budget wise/healthy food wise!
Just found your channel and I am all about easy and cheap meals! I'm recently vegan too (going on 8 months) and I need new food ideas!!
I love this!
Buying rolled oats and adding water and spices would have been cheaper and also would have produced way less waste than these little packs for each day 😕
I cannnnot find smoked tofu in the u.s 😢
RIDICULOUS!!! Why are you buying your oatmeal in single pouches if you're not even travelling right now? Why are you buying everything at Walmart anyway? And you are getting your chickpeas in a can? Did you ever hear of COOKING???
Yoooo that dijon mustard pasta made me sad :(
So... I HATE tofu (its the consistency no matter how its cooked), but I'd like to know if there are any similar vegan substitutions???
This is Great!!!...Value
Love love love that she’s able to make so much for so little! But girl USE SOME SPICES! SALT, PEPPER, CUMIN, GINGER, TURMERIC, ANY DRIED HERB I promise it makes all the difference and lasts in your pantry foreverrrrr! SPICES SPICES SPICES!
I would definitely have forgone the olives and gotten some olive oilo pair with meals and help with absorption of nutrients.. I would die without more fat in my diet lol
Great video! You should do another colab with supreme banana, you guys are my favorite YouTubers ❤️❤️❤️
Never had tofu what’s the flavor to it? New vegan!
thanks for this video. That was well worth $20.
This would probably be atleast 3 times more expensive in Norway 😑
so much plastic
Definitely NOT a Mexican thing!
Hi, could our have you done a grocery haul using only $30 for a month, if that is not doable I could go up to $50..I'm on a super low budget and I'm a WLS patient so I'm supposed to be losing weight and can't eat that much carbs - they kinda explode in my tummy . Also I'm not supposed to cook that much where I live. Thank you
Is it ok to get the fruit instant oatmeal? I know it's not as good for you but is it still vegan?
I'm impressed! Some of those meals I wouldn't eat;  girl you did the dang thing! You gave me ideas I will use. Thank you!
When you find out that Walmart literally doesn't have a real Distribution Center they just buy into other companies and put their labels on it because all those cans look like other Canadian canned foods being that I'm from America I've seen those cans
WOW!!! You can really shop😍😍😍
Holy shit thats 13$ USD american currency
It looks great!
Hate to have to point this out, but instant oatmeal packets have powdered milk in them and I’m not confident that that is vegan.
I realize this is two years old but this is awesome, thank you! I have been considering switching to vegetarian food options for a while now and might try something like this.
7:25 what did you put in that!! It was way too fast and I watched it like a billion times lol what product is it??
These meals look so sad 😂😂😂
Did you cook the whole bag of rice?
love this!!!!!!
Just bought made and armor this soooo 🔥🔥 I thought vegan was expensive but nope I’m hooked let’s help the animals and save the world woo hoo
I'm only here because i have 8$ for this upcoming week😂
Im starting my veggie diet after Thanksgiving, I just need some tips on how to get started
Love you recipes but need more cooking less talkin
THIS IS FUCKING GENIUS. TASTY, NOT BLAND MEALS, FOR 20 CANADIAN DALLAHS!!!! THIS IS WHY I LOVE AN ASIAN SISTA. YAASS KWESEN
Nice girl cheap
Such a good video
Really interesting video. Really enjoy your video series. My only question is why buy instant oatmeal packs when You can food process a big container of oats into the powder, add salt and cinnamon.
This is fantastic! Don’t normally comment on things, but I will be trying all these recipes out! My family are so fussy with food, but I think they would eat all of these recipes!
u kind of reminded me of bjork. 💕
Shorter videos
Din like your cooking. But you  are sexy hence couldn't stop the video.
Where did you learn to edit videos ? Or where can one learn to make a similar video
These look delicious I’m scared to go vegan for some reason which idk why im kinda tired of eating the same meat anyway
OMG I can totally do this! I'm on a very tight budget. I was actually thinking of what I can make this week. So I got on YouTube and found this video. Thank you so much for this great idea!
You should use the $20 to change your hair color.
What’s tofu made if
I’m going to do this! Thank you!!!
Hey CLV. thats chord for (Cheap Lazy Vegan ) i am gonna try this challange tomorow. i am not sure i am gonna pull it of. Cause i live in the Netherlands and our money is euro we don,t have dollars. I don,t think 20 euro is enough to buy all of the food. I think i am gonna be using 40 euro,s. Cause euro,s are not as cheap as dollars. I will let you know if i made it. love you,re channel. And i love you,re meal preps  love you from the netherlands . O sorry forgot my name is parna.
Hey thanks for making these. I actually just appreciate that you even did the oatmeal. I know how to do it but I want to compare if I'm doing it the same way other people are and Idk.. it just like shows you care about even the worst cooks so like yay thank you. lol
Well done! Way to stay healthy on a very tight budget!
I want to try your pasta salad—I shop at a different Walmart and SuperStore here in Vancouver, B.C. It’s great to have a Canadian point of view for these cheap vegan videos I just discovered!
That Walmart was so nice. All my Walmart’s are like the first hunger games. And the lines are ridiculously long
My breakfast chicken salad $8.50 + ice coffee $2.50 Lunch  salmon with broccoli $7.25  Dinner    carne asada 8.50 🤣
Go organic!
Being vegan...why would you go to Wal-Mart?  They are all owned by one ruthless family.  Don't trust them!
Will somebody please tell these food prepers that a week has 7 days in it. Not 4. Not 5. There really, truely are 7 days each and every week.
Brilliant!
I keep on coming back to your videos where you do this... They really helped this week after so many bills!!
This is impossible in Spain, at least where I live... Not only the price but for example bye bye tofu, quinoa is quite difficult, people say they have seen it but every time I go i cant find any, and that is just the beggining
Lovely
Maybe its only me but I LOVE oat meal with coconut milk. It makes it creamy and gives it a whole new twist! Idk WHY but one day I was making chia pudding and thought to myself "wonder what this will taste like" and it actually was really good
I know the exact Walmart this was filmed in lol
It all looks yummy. Though m nt sure it would suit indian taste. But i wud definitely try the pasta salad.
Looks good will try
This all looks so delicious I cannot wait to try 😍😍
Did she reallly call that “Mexican style” ? 😂
Love it :)
Thank u for confirming the way I cook.... lol.  i loved ur video... u have an awesome way of speaking plainly and ur cute. I will look out for more from u..... great job!
I DEFINITELY think smoked tofu tastes like ham. I actually bought some cause you love it, but I think it reminded me TOO much like ham and I can't get on board. xD
Here’s what I can buy with $20.00 USD in California:       All that.
Was it good????
I like the pasta salad but I dont use mustard with it lol gonna try the dinner now 😀
Why would you get all the canned stuff...it makes no sense..get a bag of dried beans for a dollar...it will last you three days at least. Nothing to recycle and you can also get it in bulk. Tomatoes in a can is crazy. Tomatoes leech the aluminum out of the can....good chance of getting alzheimers.
Hey Thank you so so much! This is my first time coming to study to the United States and being Indian, I was definitely worried about not getting enough vegan stuff there but your video was so helpful! They helped me boost my confidence and they are also so cheap! Hope all your wishes come true! Have a nice day!
Damn 20 cad has the Queen on it 😳
typical asian buying tofu
Awesome 😍 Thanks 🌹
I love this video so much! Thank you for giving variations so it's not the exact same thing all week!
How does she know how ham taste 12:02
I have never had meat so I have no idea if it taste like ham
Man the amount of money I could save if i cooked my own food haha
How is Canada?
Love ur hair and I'm a beginning Pescatarian, thanks for the help.
I'm not sure about Canada but in America they put beef bullion in taco seasoning. It's under the 'natural flavors' part.
I’m addicted to theses vidoes
Your so cheep!
👍🏻💜
Omg wtf is this video
Is that the Queen on your money? 😍
I think any staple seasonings in your pantry should not count in the $20 challenge
That is really impressive!        I am learning to wean myself off eating out a lot and this is perfect.
That broccoli was a great find, especially given its original price of $6.46.  That seems quite expensive for broccoli at full price.
Do you just pre-heat them in the microwave or could you reheat them in a pan?
I really love  your videos. I recently moved to California  from Michigan so I am learning to budget better  and this really helps me adjust to the change in  cost of living.  Today I went to the farmers market right as it was about to close and got three bushels of strawberries, two leek stalks, mushrooms, swiss chard, a bag of avacodos, and some cucumbers for under $15. It's not as good as the deals you get but I'm getting there😊
Actually I would highly recommend investing in a bottle of soy sauce. It adds a lot of depth in flavor for just one ingredient. Honestly for many years, most of what I ate were just random beans and veggie thrown into a pan with soy sauce, and people would still tell me that my food smells really good.
my only comment is to carefully read the ingredient list on the "packets" of seasonings....esp if you're vegetarian, vegan, gluten sensitive, etc. Manufacturers get sneaky with those packages...
What province is this in? It's so nice to see something done in Canada where everything is so much more expensive.  Walmart is quite expensive for fresh produce.
Everything looks so delicious and easy to make! =)
SMOKED TOFU tastes/smells exactly like ham!!!!!
Wow Canadian dollars look so weird I’ve never seen it before in my whole 28 years of living
The salad looks horrific. But the other stuff looks pretty good. I need to try this challenge :)
Just what I needed to see to get me food prepping.  Gotta get away from the processed stuff!
I love this channel!
Do you usually eat more fruit than this or is it not that necessary?
I love your hair!!!
I really love all your recipes. My mouth waters whenever I watch your videos. but I'm in Vietnam I don't know where to buy all the ingredients in all your videos
Is ASDA Walmart?
Oats,banana,black beans,chickpeas, almond milk , corn,Dijon mustard,Italian dice tomatoes,stuffed olives, brown rice,smoked tofu,spinach, broccoli
excellent ideas!
looks delicious. love your channel, you're always saving a girl a dollar. you should use reusable grocery bags to be more env friendly! :)
Hey, I am just curious, where area do you live in? I don't live in a big city and yet it seems you get great deals on food. Its awesome! Plus where do you go to shop?
Excellent 👍🏼
don't reheat spinach
sorry for this insult but Canadian money looks like play money  this first time i seen a paper money i don't mean to be disrespectful
Wow, this is impressive!
I think Im in Love :)
Nice healthy living and gluten free breads
Great video!
looks so good must try vegan food saver
Bulk Barn.. bulk section
Dude everything is so cheap in north america
Where I live, I would have to be using stacks upon stacks of coupons and even then It would probably went over 20$. But minimum wage where I live went up again so the groceries did the same.
I'm gonna do this this week :)
Mexican style thing? XD ok
I am so glad i found your channel! You're so relatable and have wonderful advice for new vegans (such as myself) Thank you!
So much corn 🤢
So helpful! Thankx for sharing  <3
a lot of people would just pick that up the oatmeal a complete vegan diet excludes all animal fats and Dairy there's also like the last video this girl was so poser she's going to put eggs in to the diet plan in the morning and something similar to what you're doing without the eggs which was so f****** poser
When I saw the title my first thought was that it would be $20 USD with the cheap prices of US grocery stores. Really cool to see that this can be done here in Canada!
This was great. You are great. Are you a Libra? Just curious.
You could have used more spices, because everyone has them at home anyway :)
Where can you get smoked tofu?
am i the only vegan who despises tofu? ugh it's so disgusting
My kind of cooking, cheap and lazy haha
OMG YOU'RE CANADIAN TOO! I always get excited when I find Canadian YouTubers
That was amazing.
Just made all of this, the clean up took me longer than the cooking! Thank you so much, I love that this was quick and cheap! I’m all set for the week 😊
taco bean mix thang, lol, very well cone CLV!
All that stuff in the cans are bad for you. But good job
My girlfriend has dietary needs such as no dairy, she can only stomach poultry etc. so vegan meals help me feed her haha, nice video.
Vegan Goddess! I Worship You!!
+cheap lazy vegan Just made the pasta salad with Dijon mustard and it’s delicious! Just added some additional seasoning but it’s so good! Thank you!
Sis, wth?
I didn't know there were walmarts in canada. Cool!
Fantastic meal prep! All the foods look so yummy & for $20, even better! Going to try these recipes for myself & can't wait to dig in! Thank you for these awesome ideas!
Thank you so much ❤️🙏🏻✨!!! This is so helpful!!
Hello! So I'm in college right now on a "Student Budget" and I need to ask you (because I also do groceries at walmart), what do you think about the walmart "great value" products? do you think their products taste just like a normal brand would? I am always skeptical about buying Great Value products.
this all looks great. i think smoked tofu taste like ham.
Thank you, that is great!
You are not using ORGANIC!!!. YOU ARE EATING PRODUCTS FULL OF GMO'S.
This is pretty brilliant i must say.
With those oatmeal packets i would also buy plain and do half and half so its not too much sugar.
That's amazing. If 20 Canadian dollars and that is 15 American dollars that's incredible. I am trying to save money in the next few months so I subscribed to your channel to give me ideas.
Awesome! I really appreciate it! Thank you! I'm a beginner so this video us very helpful!!!!
You are my cooking guru! I eat way less processed junk because I learned to meal prep from you. Keep up the wonderful work.
Awesome 👏 you are a genius
thats great but in U.S. it would all be gmo - and to buy this non gmo will be well over 20.00 but still real good ideas
did you check the ingredients on the oatmeal BC Most cane sugar is made with beef bone for color.
THE BIG EXPENSE IS TRANSPORTATION==CAR==BIKE IS GREAT TRANSPORTATION AND CLEAN AND GOOD FOR HEALTH..
BECAUSE OF VEGAN I START EATING HEALTHIER==I AM  JUST HALF VEGAN I DO ADD SOME MEAT..
so.. they put a plastic bag over another plastic pack instead of just put on a sticker or make a new price tag on the shelf. this amout of plastic trash makes me sick. this is not agains you, its against the stores producing so much unnesseccery trash.
Vegans are supposed to eat fresh fruits and vegs not food coming out of cans and boxes.
Love your simple and quick recipes and best if all, I don't have to listen to any unnecessary talking like in so many other videos made by other people.
Nice recipes but it looks so light. People need 2000kcal a day (men 2500) and this looks like you’d barely get half of that.
You eat healthy and vegan which is amazing, but I would never even try the food you eat, everything looks so horrible, is there any nutriments in that ?
That was great—really useful for a new WFPB guy. Thx!
I really hate that smoked tofu, for me it was like eating a rubber tire and had such a strange flavor. Also, produce from walmart seems to always let me down. Do you find that walmart has worse quality produce? Thank you for the video.
Why are you using canned products?  YUCK!  Savings or not, this is JUNK!
This is not just cheap it is good to show how small we need to eat. actually breakfast would have left me soooo hungry 2 oatmeal packets and a HALF a bannana??
12:30 The smoked tofu tastes like smoke and tofu, while tofu is mostly texture and rather tasteless, but it has odor depending on the process used to make it which is ... by the smoke.
Careful with oatmeal like that very sugary.
Amazing video
Awesome!!! Very helpful and easy to intake. But please, and not just you but all humans - STOP SAYING "LITERALLY" SO OFTEN HOLY HELL IT'S SO UNNECESSARY AND DESTROYS THE VERY PURPOSE OF THE WORD.
I looove watching your what I eat in a day and meal prep videos! I swear you're the only one who keeps my mind focused. The way you explain the process and your tone of voice make it easy to follow 👌 plus you make easy recipes and they're cheap too, ugh 💕💕
Ok... I'm going semi vegan, haha, to give it a try... so what is the best method on starting out? I have experience in cooking, but not vegan food.
awesome job!
you're eating foods from walmart so you might as well be eating garbage
Very Creative ideas , way to Strecth a Buck ... Thumbs up
I know I'm over a year late, but I must say the pasta salad recipe has become one of my staples. However, I use mashed avocado instead of Dijon mustard and black olives instead of green olives!
Lol I’m going to have to try that method of cooking broccoli sometime. Pouring boiling water on top in a bowl.  Rewatching this again to help boost it up to 1 mil views ;)  I’m in love with your meal prep vids. And esp since this was a $20 one too! Ps I love mustard as my dressing on salads. Haha! Ppl look at me like I’m strange but I love it! I don’t think it’s strange cuz honestly if you eat mustard on a sandwich with veggies, what’s the difference minus the bread, and adding a few more veggie??! 🤔
Being Vegan is only expensive when you first start eating that way because when you look at all the food you have you realize it all has animal products in it and you have to throw it all away and start fresh.  After that first big shopping trip it's cheaper to eat vegan.  Meat is a lot more expensive than veg.

Lol....your so funny.😂😂
That Oriental speaks perfect English and talks like an American. Wow
Thank you for the video I love simple meals i just started my vegan journey, I recently had a heart stent, no more Meat whatsoever I used to eat only chicken but read it's horrible for cholesterol  also gonna stop oils, thank you for your vids they encouraged me. Ken
you did a great job!! proof that veganism can be SIMPLE, tasty, and AFFORDABLE <3
Girl!!! You need to give me the color name for your hair!!!! PLEASE!!! I'll subscribe!!! lol lol jk
Veganism is cheap meat is expensive
Did you know your hair is reddish, purple? Great video BTW.
Love it. Thank you.
Omg this is so amazing!!
13:16 ... One full meal for me.
150 calorie breakfast. 200 calorie lunch and dinner.  That's um ... hmm.
WOW my head exploded...easy, ingredients already in the grocery store, cheap, vegan and genius! I normally have a hard time coming up with my own ideas and make the same thing over and over again....thank you so much! New sub.
She went to her local Fema camp yay.
Vegans can eat any pasta?
Vegans can eat any pasta?
Don't go vegan they say, it's gonna be expencive they say...
Nice video! A little food for thought. Buy Organic. Why? Because it's not GMO! People may say Organic is expensive. It's your body and your health. It's supposed to be expensive. You have to treat it like a well oiled machine: feeding it, nurturing it, proper rest, sleep, etc. Don't buy cheap groceries cause at some point, your body will feel it! God Bless!
Cool ideas and good video. 👍🏼. You may want to stay away from the canned tomatoes and consider using Himalayan pink salt instead of table salt.✌🏼️
Ur channel is the best
Thank you, so much for saving my life! Your meals are helping me afford what I need to not be anemic. I have been spending a fortune on vegetarian products and still could not get rid of my anemia. I am feeling so much better!  Thank you!
Omg I LOVE your channel! I'm not vegan yet....sorry...but I love recipes in other videos and how you meal prep for lazy people or just really busy people. Thank you for what you do!
That same broccoli here is $5 regular price!
youre amazing!!! Love this!!
i like when u said "one dorra". embrace the third world...it's as hot as it gets.
What song is this i dig it.
yummy
so you cooked everything in one day and put it in containers for the week? I'm trying to make the change to vegan because of digestive issues. I  have gone to the local vegan places but eating out is way too pricey. I'd love to do this for myself. I just want to make sure i'm following this correctly. :D  Seeing that you can do it for cheap is even MORE attractive lol.
ewww no offense but that look nasty and i'm vegan too so i rather eat some perro jkjk i love my dog but i wont eat that
Girl superstore is cheap and had way better options up here in the great white north
This should be a Walmart Add. M
I LOVE your channel! Please have more of these 20.00 challenges. My husband and I are currently on a financial plan to be debt free and on a tight budget. I have used your 20.00 challenge to create delicious, healthy meals for the week.
Im about to start my vegan journey and i found you! Tnx 💖
smoked tofu tastes like dog food in my opinion
Walmart sells a huge bag of oatmeal for 2$ here in Ontario Canada.
Great Video, but: With this little amount of oat for breakfast i would be hungry again after one hour...
U should go to No Frills or Superstore as they have awesome prices
Omg I love your hair so pretty😍💖
Co-Op would be cheaper
Great video. Thanks for showing how to save money and eat well for a week. Love it!!!!
Not gonna lie, I hate eating mushy meals, especially oatmeal and applesauce
Can you make meals of vegan pasta?
So... more expensive here in the us...
i love it
the before the. video add was for a steak restaurant. Literally the whole ad was a big steak
Smoked tofu interesting:)
It's so crazy, I looked in my kitchen and I have all the ingredients to make the pasta. Right away I started cooking and it smells delicious. I'm so glad I stumbled upon this video 😊
Bubz beauty?!?!
I think with your challenge that spices and soya sauce would be okay to use as most people have those things in the cupboard already . Special sauces like fish sauce or plum sauce or steak sauce they might not but they would have a hot sauce and soya sauce
"and that's including tax!" xD
Hah, still got the Queen on your money! "Independence"
IT TASTES LIKE HAM
This was really great and inspiring for someone just starting out on a plant-based diet journey...you gained a subscriber! I love how human and funny you were too throughout - made it way more fun. Keep up the great work :D
You are inspirational...❤️❤️❤️Made me think of how much money i will save from this. Thanks alot! Godbless🌹😘
Jesus. If you are man with active lifestyle this amount of food is enough only maximum for 2 days. Ofcourse for a little girl this  is more than enough. Despite that, I love how you use ingridiends.
Canadian money looks lovely 😊 lol
Effin WINNING! I love this. ❤️
great video!
i think its amazing that you could buy all this food for only $20. like they need a show on food network where you come on and you give your tips like this.
I'm English and live in Sweden. Serious question why is the queen on Canadian money?
Literally just made the meals. And boii are they nice and tasty. I did spice them up a bit and added a few of my own twists but this is good. And it doesn't even cost too much, amazing. I'm hot and tired but it was all worth it. Thank @Cheap Lazy Vegan
I love the end credits music
you bought a bunch of processed food this isn't particularly healthy (face palm)
Do you freeze this or put in the refrigerator?
Love your hair! So beautiful :D
We have the same car it looks like
What *vegan* goes to *Walmart* of all places to purchase GMOs?
You look like princess Ariel
ok ..yeah..no...you lost me at the nasty sugar loaded oatmeal...biye
I'm so inspired to lower my grocery bill now
There's tax on grocery food in Canada?
I love it! I just tried it today and I think this vegan recipe will work and maybe transition my family to eat more veggies. I love this meal prep idea in a budget. Great job. Thank you so much! Xoxo
Im so happy i found your channel!!! I'm both cheap and lazy :D
awesome
M
Oh boy! Hidden advertising of "great value" products. Processed foods mixed with gmo produce and smoked gmo tofu :( it's no better than eating animal protein if even worse it. Brrr
That was great for just $20! I'm definitely trying this.
I would love if you would make another
hi there i was wondering would this be good to build muscle and burn fat also?.. in the 1 week?
So helpful!
YAYYY A FELLOW CANADIAN
Try doing that without buying cans of food or instant oatmeal.
totally subbed to your channel
great!!
You have a super cheap store for food lol.....that would be almost double in some places for all that
Some good suggestions. Thanks for sharing!
Since Drs are only taught minimal about nutrition who decided breakfast is so important? Breakfast is not the most important meal of the day, historically it has only become the most important meal in the last 200 years, we have just bought into advertising,. Great video!
I wish the Walmart stores in the US did the reduced produce like that.
Just tried it today, it really took only one hour to prepare, and it tastes really good!!
Read the ingrediants on that cheap Great Value oatmeal and the dijon mustart.  There's no point in being vegan if your taking in cheap refined sugars that cause system wide inflammation.
looks disgusting to swallow

thank you gonna try this meal prep soon, converting to vegan very soon.
Hi! I am a new vegan and running out of lunch/dinner ideas fast. thank you for all your amazing videos! you can make so many healthy and tasty foods for cheap... it's amazing.
The breakfast prep looked the best  to me... Meal prepping for the week does seem to make the week a lil less chaotic, definitely will be trying it out.
Hey, does anybody know good resources (website / book) on veganism,  different kinds of veganism and how to get started well without risks?  Highly interested!
ohmycat why supermarket puts the plastic on more plastic just to make it cheaper???? stop with the plastic wallmart!
FUCK WALMART
This is the way I would eat as a very very last resort, because a variety of herbs and spices are worth- investing-in medicine for our bodies. And since there is even more nutrition loss because it's not super fresh and organic, think it's best to incorporate the natural medicines. Love your videos.
that oatmeal is garbage get steel cut oats .salt is no good wtf kinda diet is this pasta is crap too
I love taco seasoning, it adds so much flavor but I've never seen the Great Value Taco Seasoning so I just get the Lowry's.    Thankx for your video
Walmart, ummm not the best place for produce.
That smoked tofu looks like a smoked cheese lol
Challenge Accepted 👌
what kinds of camera do you use?
Thanks! Love you, more videos like this! Take care Vicki
I went vegan a week ago. I feel totally lost. This helps so much. Thank you!!!!!
was the pasta whole grain or regular?
Smoked anything always tastes like ham to me! It's not my fave flavour 😕
THANK YOU.😀
Looks bomb.
She said the only thing extra she was using was salt however she adds banana to her breakfast oatmeal which wasn't part of the groceries...
Thanks girl I'm becoming a vegetarian and this is such a big help for my meal prep
🍜☯🔮💖🙄☄🌈🍀
Ew Wal-Mart
This is great considering she went to Walmart which is really really expensive. Going to no frills, or food basics likely would have allowed her to buy even more. But that 1$ bag of broccoli? Incredible! I love awesome scores like that.
those beans have EDTA in them...not good..I know they are cheap but Walmart brand canned beans have crap additives
Mikrowave apparently still a think in the US.
why dont you atleast use oil to stir fry?
0:55 "okay we're at walmart" said that like u were on a mission 😂
Bad quality
I hope when you said you would add soy sauce that you meant specifically vegan soy sauce. Regular soy sauce is not vegan.
I see pasta puttanesca in this for one thing. smoked tofu does have a ham like flavored to me and I use it in my pea soup often, replaces the ham bone.
Wow. Everything looks extremely nasty.
Doesn't that pasta have egg in it? If it's from Walmart, there is no likely way its vegan.
But it's all processed. Health wise, you may as well eat meat!
I like the fact that you are Canadian and you shop at stores that I can actually get to.  The meals looked good but I feel like I probably would have added more spices than just salt because for me at least, cooked veggies and beans need some help in the flavor department.
if go vegan wtf you buy that processed crap😂 fk me. Buy normal beans not fking canned.
When she went into Walmart she looked like an undercover spy 😂 you're so cute 💕
I'm always obsessing over buying cans i hear i shouldn't and should get fresh instead but it's so convenient for me...
U r a ROCKSTAR 😘❤️💕
Looking at that can of tomatoes and drooling XD
Tip: I discovered that frozen corn is cheaper and tastes INFINITELY better than canned corn. It tastes like fresh corn :D blegh canned corn tastes so weird  Also if you want to save money on veggies, frozen are way cheaper than fresh, and as long as you cook them, they taste basically the same as fresh
so u amde for the whole week in one time and in the fridge ?
yes! Cad money, I was calculating n my head how much 20usd would be in cad, but then you showed the money... thanks
Nice work all the way around!
So I can cook all meals in one day and keep them in the fridge? :) I just moved in my first very own apartment (always lived with bfs before) and I seriously need to prep my food more. We have catering at work, but not all Cooks do some vegan options for me and its def cheaper to prep than paying 8 bucks everyday for not really 100 % good food (dry bread and black coffee everymoriing for example, its vegan but not healthy and fulfilling).
You for real? Since when is dijon mustard vegan??
I make a huge pot of vegan food like chili or a mediterranean dish and it's my go to food for the week
Doesn't oatmeal have milk??
THANK YOU!!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️
i spend £20 on food every 7 days, including drinks and everything; i've never struggled
Its a good thing we had HEB and Walmart where I live but how much does Whole Foods cost? I heard they had some vegan products but I also heard they are expensive
dried beans would have been cheaper
hah i ate my lawn for a week $0 fuck you
You know what would be embaresing..... Discovering one of your dinner gusts is vegan and having to whip somthing up at the last moment.
Her hair is so cute 😛
$2.50 for tofu!? It's literally like $5+ here in NZ :(
mini heart attack at how much water she added to that oatmeal like girl thats soup
I love balsamic vinegar, Dijon mustard, and nooch on roasted broccoli.  I bet that would be good in the pasta salad!!!!
thanks for this video and  you are awesome :)
Why write "for the week" in the title when it is only for 5 days?
for me, I found the spinach in the pasta salad to be... awkward for lack of a better word. however, maybe if it were chopped up, that would work better for me to still get the nutrition from it.
Love your recipes!  Thanks so much.  I love your casual, easy attitude in cooking.  I have never been able to "get it" with vegan cooking, but your sauces and seasonings (from other videos) have transformed the way I eat!!! You made it soooo easy for me, thankyouuuuu soooo much!! Keep it up girl, you are rocking this!!
You've definitely made my transition to Veganism a hell of a lot easier! Thank you!
that breakfast is look Iike a spoon full of my breakfast🙈
bulk helps a lot
no thanks on walmart
Awesome job, the meals look tasty, I'm gonna give this a shot
I am doing this meal prep today just for the heck of it. I generally try to keep a lot of frozen, canned & dry food to make life easier so I think I have almost everything on the list. I'm going to use frozen stir fry mix in the place of the fresh broccoli, an extra can of garbanzos since I don't have black beans. And I'm going to incorporate garlic. But yeah I am doing this because I buy too much food, throw too much away, and eat out too much. I think I'm going to do some split pea and kidney bean soup after this so I can start using all of my beans and legumes. I just keep buying premade & fresh because I don't really want to cook. So this prep looks pretty easy & like a good way to get the ball rolling.
Pretty pasta bowl!
love it 😄😃😀😊☺😉👍🍀
I can't believe how much the broccoli costs! In Germany you get 1 Kilo of it for like 90 ct ( in Euros) 😳.
thanks for everything! bought the exact same products and have never cooked in my life. came out perfect!(:
I love your videos but where's the real seasonings?
I thought pasta had eggs in it?
Planning would take some stress out of shopping ...
I'm so glad this was $20 Canadian!     I want to eat healthier but I don't want to spend a ton of money
So many great ideas out of this! love your channel name... perfectly sums up my approach to cooking! Not technically vegan but I find meat hard to cook and expensive so... I normally leave it out haha. I may have to subscribe :)
I'm African, my taste buds do not work with all of these.. I'd have to rework everything lol. Plus without spicy stuff one could seriously throw up. That's kind of upsetting because being vegan as an African can be really hard.
Really entertaining watching you briefly shop and pull this all together. I get regular firm tofu but not the beans so much. This inspires me to switch out ingredients and see if it can still stay close to $20.
To make cheap instant oatmeal more like the real thing add a little less than the recommended ammount of water and microwave it. Heartier texture and the sugar carmalizes a bit and tastes sweeter. I know it's adding to the cost of the weeks meals but add a dash of plant milk, chopped banana, and maybe a small spoonful of nutbutter and you have a great breafast.
Huh?  Plain oatmeal is not processed and is cheaper.  So many canned items...not sure why.
Just made number 2 and I'm eating it as I type this 😂 probably my new favourite pasta tbh
Duffrine mall!!!lol
That money can't be real: it has a woman on it.
I'm a super picky eater and I usually just think 1 or 2 of the recipes look like something I would eat regularly but these all look delicious!! You're one of my favorite YouTubers!!
$15 US ... Jesus you can't get anything here for that
I pretty much was just like. . .she is pretty... she's really pretty. . .wow. . .SHE IS SO CUTE!!!
This would last me like 2 days, this food does not look filling at all.
Heading to Harris Teeter to get this now. Let's see if my total even comes close to $19.94. I'm predicting  $32 at least.
wow! you did a good job, and gave me some ideas! Thank you, and keep up the good work
The stuff in the olives typically has gelatin!!!
Easy way to tell someone has been a college student... "I have 2.50 left, so I should spend it because that is a significant amount of money"   I am dying here =)  Sorry I'll shut up now and watch the rest of the video....
Why is it that none of the vegan meal prep videos use any good oils, such as olive oil, to add some healthy fats and good flavor?
Did the math. This provides about 1,560 calories per day at a cost of approximately 380 calories per dollar. Not bad.
Those were GMO from Wally World but I like the meal ideas
meh 2 laze eye just behy froot nooots und veggees
That was really impressive!
Rolled or steel cut Oatmeal , unpolished rice and beans . Cheap and filling with complete protein . Add 3 whole fruits a day and a vitamin b12 supplement .
Hello.  Great video, very informative to me.  Wall of text incoming, apologies.  Anyway, I've recently switched to a vegan only diet and so far, I'm coping as expected. A lot of swearing, foul moods, craving pizza, steak etc... But I'm adjusting and I'm happy to not eat meat again.  My main point of commenting was that I followed your meal plan to see if a budget £20 could allow me all the ingredients in the list. And surprisingly it did, £16.62 in total. Unfortunately, that's roughly $29.40 In Canadian Dollars. That's exchange rates for you.  Thanks again for your video.
Was going to subscribe to your channel but that loud fucking music between talking pissed me off
I personally don't like tofu but everything else looks so good!! Haven't tried to mustard but might have to now! :)
Girl, get it.  You did great on this challenge.  TFS!!
Great ideas but I need seasonings and pan cooked food lol
This is the best tutorial video I have seen in awhile.  You have simplified it and made it so easy and not overwhelming for Prepping. Also  off topic, what Eye shadow and lipstick are you wearing? You should do a vegan makeup tutorial.  Thanks again.
I'm a beginner transitioning to vegan, plant based meals thank you you make it look easy
I love you!! I don't know how to cook, I'm lazy, and I'm vegan. You make it so easy! Thanks ❤️
Can I change black beans to red kidney beans?
Great video. You could stretch the money even further by buying dry chickpeas and black beans and frozen corn. Much less expensive than canned, at least in my supermarket. Just need to soak the beans/chickpeas overnight, toss the water, and simmer in fresh water for a couple of hours the next day. One bag of beans makes 2 cans.
How was your energy levels by the end of this plan?
If it's canned, it's banned; read the label lol
Totally gonna make these. Good and affordable
WOW!!!  This is awesome!!!!!  I'm so impressed that I've already purchased your recipe ebook and subscribed to your channel!  LOVE IT!!!!
Give us a 👀 look 👌🏻 https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/855658770/the-fresh-eatz-company
Gross. There's no price you can put on health... a bit of broccoli and spinach? Combined with the bulk of grains she's not going to be healthy. And that instant oatmeal is garbage. That alone will give you cancer, no matter what mystic music you play while cooking it.. fail.
EVER HEARD of "SOUTH INDIAN VEGETARIAN/VEGAN FOOD". Just Google it. IT's cheap, easy and people have been doing that there for over 2000 years. There are THOUSANDS of videos on YouTube and tens of THOUSANDS of recipes of all kinds of dishes. You Americans make me sick with your stupidity and awful recipes. Oh, and did I mention south Indian food tastes amazing?
Same Walmart I go haha omg thanks
Supporting Walmart and using plastic bags ruined it for me... I know it was a $20 challenge but shopping on sale at local/organic co-ops can be done cheaply too
Not a fake thumbs up. Stumbled upon this via reddit and I am going to give it a try. Never been a vegan but due to health issues I am giving it a go :)
Wow Thank You so much for doing this video and I to shop at Walmart :)and love GV products their much less expensive and you can save money....I'm just starting out doing this since I have developed health issues and need to start eating healthier...you've really eased my mind here...Thank You so much!!!!!
where in Canada are you that you can get all that food for $20? I'm in rural Central Alberta and even at Walmart or superstore, that would cost at least double!
Thanks for this just what i needed :-)
i can get cheaper than that i make thabomb split pea soup and guacamole and my own corn bread i make and bbq tofu tacos yum
I kept being like "why is everything in french" but then I remembered u were in canada
And I just blew fucking 250 at trader joe's attempting to be vegan. FOH
does the food for vegans have to be organic/
I'm sure that instant oatmeal is loaded with a crap ton of sugar.  If that's not a consideration then by all means.  Everything else seems legit and looks good.  You could easily add a few flourishes to this without adding a great deal of cost.  Like some white wine vinegar and fresh garlic and mix with the Dijon mustard for a more interesting home made dressing for example.
dear all, the idea of meal prep is vvery interesting to me but I am afraid the meal will not last for 5 days, shall I guess you freeze them?
Omg looks soooo good!!
Finally some easy to prepare vegan food with easy to get ingredients!  I loved the whole video. I'm a new vegan so I'm looking for easy recipes that don't involve a lot of salads. I subscribed and will be checking out the rest of your videos. Thanks!
Good Girl!
May be next time you can bring your own bags, so you save the environment for al the plastic bags.
Good job but skip the salt and taco stuff that can lead to over weight and other health problems. Cute vid tho
In Germany a pound of oats is like 50ct😇so with some fruit you can have a 10-30 ct breakfast🤗
you look like Bjork
Shoulda hit up a Bulk Barn, my friend...
if you werent doing a challenge, getting 5kg bags of rice and pasta can actually be more worthwhile in the long run :)
I love your hair color 💕
I love how you use all of your ingredients! Because I cook for myself I often have a lot of wasted food! This will prevent this from happening!
Well your meals look great for $20 you'd struggle in the UK!!
Why would you spend so much on instant oatmeal when you can get like 1 kg for less than a dollar
Eat a rare steak please!
Wow!  That was a tough challenge!  For these challenges, I think you shoud be allowed to use some spices and staples from your pantry (salt, pepper, soy sauce, spices, etc.) just to give each meal some variety and more interest.  Good on you for sticking exactly to the rules, though.  Love your videos.
OK I seriously LOVE you already.
New subscriber here!  Loving your meal prep! Awesome ideas that I'm definitely trying asap!  Also, I love your hair color! Do you do it yourself? What do you use?! I've been coloring my hair red for a long time now but I've always wanted my color to be as vibrant as yours and I can't find the right products!
This was nice, but I would have sprung for a bulb of garlic :) I'm lucky living in California. Produce is very affordable most of the year and the only things I buy canned are chickpeas, corn, and some tomatoes but that one is out of laziness :)
No, no microwaves, ever....
Can you freeze it for 5 days? How long will it take before it goes bad?
I tried this for 3 days and it's gross
I believe you might want to check out the ingredients in the oatmeal. Be careful of hidden lactose/dairy.  Nice job on creating a variety of flavor profiles!
Canadian money looks so pretty 😻
I'm very impressed with what you came up with for your frugality. Nice job!
Love it
I'm with you on the breakfast thing. Most of the time, I'm not really all that hungry during breakfast. I don't want to eat some big meal early in the morning. I end up just having tea and some fruit or a shake or something. Then I gear up for a hearty vegan lunch and dinner!
I loved the video and these ideas! I just have to say, the "taco seasoning" doesn't make the food "Mexican", lol. There are loads of different taco flavors, and to be a taco, something should have be a corn (soft) tortilla stuffed with something c;
Wait but doesn't pasta have egg in it?
literally almost died when she said the broccoli was in the reduced pile xD
great prep just need to sub on the tofu.
0:23   *YEAH CANADA!!!!!*
Hello!  I own/run a wellness business and I gotta say Girl, you done right!  I would recommend this to a client.  Good job!
i live in mexico and 20$ is still too much for just one week for one person. i typically spend 50 for 2 people for 2 full weeks when i vegan meal prep which is about a thousand pesos
Didn't know there was tax on food in Canada. Here in the states most foods hat are not junk/prepared are tax free at least in CT, but I think throughout the US.
you are the best
These recipes are very creative 👍  But, I'm always worried that doing meal prep for the week like this, the food will go bad before the end of the week. Does this ever happened to you?
Music volume is too high compared to your voice. especially wearing headphones
GARBONZO BEANS ARE BAe💕💕💕💕
wow $20 ...amazing
Where do her eye lids go when she opens her eyes.
Brava! Inspiring! I looove salt, but I think the recipes where you used salt would taste just as good with lemon juice, in place of the salt.
Oh, the instant oatmeal issue! I found that plain whole oats microwave just as well, with water barely to cover, cooked on high for 2 & al half minutes. Then I add raisins or banana and almond milk, and it's perfect.
When people don't get why I spend hours grocery shopping, this is it. Lol. I want to eat healthy but I also have to make it work with my budget. It is a hard relationship to make work.  This is so awesome to watch. :)
omgosh that bowl ! i love it !
Do you have self harm scars on your arm, sorry if it's random I was just wondering
Just subscribed! Love your videos
For people who can't or don't want to eat soy/tofu, use canned jackfruit, quite good. And for people who can't do lentils or chickpeas, use green beans, pea's or more corn. And for people who can't eat tomatoes, either buy a product called nomato OR make your own,  which is quite easy, just take some carrots, beet, onion, (or onion powder), celery, bay leaf, spices of choice,some water, place in pot, with lid and boil then reduce heat and simmer until veggies are soft,  remove bay leaf, then blend till smooth and use like you would tomato sauce :-) And for the dish where it has it the rice, beans spinach etc, instead of making it into a salad you can put it on a gluten free taco shell, really good :-) Hope these idea's help
so.. im trying to go vegan.. but ive never had tofu.. does it actually taste any good? whats the best way to have it?
I mean..... WOOOOOWW!!!! Great job! Please do it again!
Wow u rock girl. Awesome thx
Love your red hair! Thanks for the video :)
is this all you would eat in 7 days ? it doesn't seem like a lot or maybe food takes a really important place in my life
I would go through this in a day. How are you surviving on this?
I like how you use the leftovers to make another entree 👍
@Cheap Lazy Vegan Will you make me the happiest vegan in the world and marry me?!
you are so cute. thanks for the tips <3
Love your personality and this is a Great Vid!! Thank You >>>>>>
Here where I live the freezed broccoli only would cost you 20 bucks
:( Moved to Sweden from the UK and it is so expensive here, but will definately try this!
A Canadian Meal Prep!!!!!! So happy to see someone up here doing a meal prep! Small tip, use an app like Flipp to price match at Real Canadian Super Store/No Frills/Wal-Mart for extra savings to stretch your $ even further. You can save about $3/ get about $3 more food!
WHERE DID YOU GET SMOKED TOFU!!? I had it at chopped leaf the other day and it's so good! (I live in Edmonton)
We would be great friends I act like you in the store🕊😂
I love this!! I'm in graduate school only working part time, so I budget $25/week for groceries and I'm a vegetarian. I usually try to aim for more variety though -- like I'll buy a tiny bit of 10 different veggies instead of a lot of 3 kinds of veggies.
did you get 10 or 15 meals out of those ingredients?
Lol, the cheese ad before the video.... Who plans out what ads go on what videos? Lol!
Ugh it's really bugging me how watery your instant oatmeal is...
personally I would spend an additional $10 on sriracha, spices, garlic and onions. Good recipes though, will them a try :) thanks
Save On has 1kg of organic quick oats for about $4.99
This hair color tho 😍 what brand is this?
what brand tofu do you buy?
It's good to know how to get by with less amounts of money.   This is my life and tbh it feels pretty wholesome
how much do her meal preps usually cost
This proves that it is not as expensive as they say. Well done
thanks i started meal preping recently and need ideas
I would rather spend the extra $$ and go organic...and never at Walmart, Sprouts is much cheaper.
I commented with: this is a bit blend in my opinion :( but then I realized its actually not bad considering its pretty much pure vegan, so kudos!
super funny!
Ughhhhh as a vegan nutritionist myself this is way too many carbs and not enough protein.  Studies also show a high link of soy products linked to cancer and is a goitrogen harmful to our thyroids.  Is there even enough iron and vitamin A in this?
I'm not vegan but I am on a budget while trying to eat healthier so thank you!
I think i will try this meal prep! I want to challenged myself and i use to eat too much big portion. This will make me control the amound of food i will eat.. This look very interesting!! Thank you for the video! You could make more meal prep on a budget while being vegan... Please! Have a nice day
Looks wonderful! Thanks for sharing.
I've been watching your channel for couple days now and tried out your pasta salad this afternoon to take to work for the next few days. tastes great! thanks for helping my transition into a healthier lifestyle easier and tastier!
Yes, these are yummy looking dishes and look very healthy as you know all the nutritional value. I realized before I watched this today that I am sick and tired of spending way too much money on food. However it is so much cheaper to buy a big container of oatmeal and mix in your own cinnamon and apples. When I buy a small jar of cinnamon it lasts about a year maybe more.
I love you and love this video... you're authenticity is beautiful.
Do i need freeze this meals? What about consistency, is it ok?
my concern with this is does it taste good
I really enjoy your videos, you are also really hot.
Nothing you bought was vegan, !
Please make more videos like this!
Buy in bulk for the rice and beans to make it cheaper.
penne normally has eggs
Wow that spinach and broccoli in the $1 section was such a steal!! :) I have started hunting around that $1 section too for awesome veggies - I myself found green peppers and other veggies too!
For an extra challenge, attempt this by shopping at Whole Foods.
So how many times a day you eat?
This is the first time I've watched u and I loved this because it is so practical and most people don't have a lot of time or money so yes great job
Finally a video for vegetarians that has cheap food items, most videos I have previously watched have been with way too pricey products. Thank you!
Thank you for sharing!!! You are so creative!! ❤
I made everything on here!!! thanks for the video. it took me longer, but not too long. the best is the taco one mmmm 💝
is that 20 by day?
just a piece of advice, ethnic markets like asian or latino supermarkets usually have much cheaper fresh veggies!
making all of these recipes this week :-) Thank you! xxx
At Whole Foods will be 100 bucks
I'm in canada too!! just found your channel and it's very inspiring. #newvegan
Omg im food is soo expensive these days,  but this really showed me how to spend since I'm a new vegan
Very nice indeed. Wonderful. I have written everything down. Canned tomatoes is a no no. When is your book coming out? Just a thought.  Thank you. keep it coming. Greetings from the UK.
Frozen veggies $1 a bag!
Some excellent tips! Thanks so much. Starch based diet for cheap veganism is the way to go :D
By the way, I am beginning a Vegan life-style, the previous posted comment of mine about Soy, was left for people to consider only...
Soy...... http://livingtraditionally.com/whats-so-bad-about-tofu-1/
Hi guys, how long is it safe to store cooked rice.
hey can i freeze everything ? or how long can i keep it in the fridge ?
great video. well done. keep up the great work :)
Your red hair is bomb!!!  The best post ever. Love your style of prepping. You are the queen of meal prep ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ that's it hands down to you doll.
New sub. I love you and everything about you. You radiates love and good vibes❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️. Not to mention the best cooking tutorial. You go girl.
love this,.. thank you for posting
20$ cool. but not worth the gmo nutrition defecient food that u are ingesting '_'
All good ideas, the only thing I would suggest is adding tomato puree to thicken the sauce as well as maybe some garlic and paprika and pepper, it just adds so much more flavour to the sauce. Also roasted broccoli is one of the best things in the world, and is amazing hot or cold!
i've been binge watching vegan meal prep videos because i really need to get in the habit of prepping all my meals. yours are amazing and everything here looks so good.
What would you say some vegan must haves are for people starting their vegan life ?
I didn't see a single organic ingredient. conventional apples are among the most toxic and conventional corn (except popcorn) is guaranteed Monsanto.
I think you are a star I'm not even a vegan and I learned from your videos. Brilliant
Why is that the most delicious looking tofu I've ever seen? xD
She just can't cook. the vegan lifestyle isn't that bad
omg! Canadian monies looks so.. shiney!! love your videos, and meal preps.
I love your channel!! You're so down to earth, fun, and easy going. I've finally found the "lazy" vegan cooking channel I've been looking for....Some vegans put sooo much time and energy into their meals and I ain't got time for that haha
i love some of your ideas but i gather you mainly eat vegan just because of the cruelty factor? microwaving destroys you foods nutritional value. and yo eat glysophate city unless the oatmeal is organic. major carcinogen there and the microwave. just a heads up on this.
i love how you transform one meal into another, i'm always bored of the same meals Every day so you inspired me a lot.thank you and go on😍
It would have been really nice to know how much everything was individually? You mentioned a couple of prices for the reduced items but not anything else. I would be interested in the oatmeal cost since instant packets tend to be far more expensive than loose. I can get a kilo of oats in the UK for 75p. This will last me a month or more depending.  I do think this was a good effort so please don't think I am being super critical. I am just about to upload my first video on how to eat healthily on a budget so this is currently on my mind. A couple of ways that you could have gotten more for your money . . . . buy loose rolled oats instead of instant. Buy dry beans and chickpeas instead of canned and you will have enough for several weeks after. Buy frozen broccoli instead and you would have gotten around 4 or 5 times the amount for about the same price.  I hope this helps? Over the next couple of weeks I am going to be uploading several videos on this subject so if anyone needs help in this area please feel free to watch and message me. Food poverty is a real issue. people in developed countries are dying of hunger - it's insane!! This is my way of doing my bit to help and raise awareness.
Good effort.. but the food is mostly bland and grainy.. you need to eat more spices, onions, ginger, garlic.. try to make indian style flat bread with wheat flour or cornflour.
What cost her 20 cost me 50 when I tried it
Impressive! Great to see how one can eat vegan very reasonable and with quick prep...
WOW amazing! very inspiring! such EASY meals with NORMAL SIMPLE ingredients lol Just one note though: no matter how gently, metal should never come in contact with teflon skillet because it may scratch it and then :( cancer leaks out. Also don't put hot food in plastic containers because heat stimulates bad things in plastic to come out even if its BPA free so then.. :( cancer. I know some people don't care about this stuff but i believe its a very tiny routine things that can be easily changed and just one less toxin thing to worry about.
Hi everyone, I did a video on how to make a vegan, Thai-styled mushroom curry in my channel. Do check it out!
Thank you!!
If only food was this cheap in Australia
I'm sure you know you can also save that chickpea liquid for aquafaba, making that can of chickpeas even MORE valuable! :)
7:32 actual prep
You should look into local places for veggies. We have a veggie place just up the street from us and we can buy 2-3 large bags of veggies for 20$
should of went to bulk barn you would of got a lot more for a lot less
spinach and tomatoes are not a good combination
where in canada r u
If you look on the inside pouch of oatmeal you can pour the water in it up to the red line on the inside. perfect water and you don't really have to measure.
This is why I love HEB compared to Walmart where I live. Much cheaper and the produce is always more fresh! ❤️
Nice video. I think you could probably have made it cheaper and then included some other stuff and if you're really picky do price per meal as you had leftovers but who does that.. It is an interesting point to see how this would all come out nutritionally and it's a fair point in those dollar a day challenges that is really difficult to be nutritionally adequate on a budget. Really nice video though if you're looking for quick healthy meal prep for under £12 that's quite an achievement. How did you feel after eating that for 5 days ? Was it sufficient?
Vegans really are the best at bullshit cheffery.
This was agreeable to understand- Iv been checking out some others on YT that were way too complicated in comparison. My main thing wrong is cheese and some sweets or processed stuff. I still eat baked chicken, ham and turkey as well as fish.
I'm in LOVE with your channel. You're recipes are ACTUALLY really easy!! Perfect for a lazy vegan like me :D
I don't like all the packaging you bought. Great point that vegan is cheap and healthy but Seriously why not just buy bulk oats? sweeten with banana or dates. Better for your budget and way better for the environment especially if you go to a bin inn. Classic vegan who cares about their body but not the environment
Please look up the word "literally" and learn to use it properly.
That food looks so sad. Needs more spices.

I usually get already diced mixed frozen veggies for 1.50€ and you get a whole kilogram. It's perfect for quick meals and since it's frozen it is still very fresh and contains all nutrients.
Looks so good
Just noticed this one, awesome perfect for me. Thanks. Will let you know how I do.
There's so much plastic packaging on all the food 😭
make your own taco seasoning with less preservatives than the packaged stuff 😉
YES HUNTY! FInally a vegan who mindful of her wallet, shit WORK
This is such a helpful video, I start spring semester next week so meal prep seems like the way to go for me!
Your channel is seriously amazing!!! <3 i'm trying this meal prep next week for sure
Thanks a lot for your video (and your channel). I am vegan but I was eating out a lot, even I like cooking. I think I am going to change it because of you!
awesome love u
I *LOVE* the "Cheap Lazy" concept.  Good for you!!!
Lol great value
smoked tofu has such a thick creamy texture i love it
Loved the video! Just subscribed💛
VEGAN IS THE FUTURE
Hi! i want to become a vegetarian but i was afraid of not feeding my body properly. With all your videos, you've given us (my family and I) a lot of information to start this process. Keep the good work :D
FROM OUR RE. MOUNEY T. THORNRIDGE FBI OUBVIUEBVN .M L LI OEAIUES .C VI NOIUN HUIJ .M. FOR OLA WILLIAMS AND THE FFFIAMILIEY.K
Great to find a Canadian Vegan Channel!!!! =)
fuckin gassy
salt?
I like meat
I eat a lot, so that would probably only last me for 2 to 3 day. :P lol
I saw you on Happy Pear for the Mac Cheese. That was good but this video is amazing. Thank you.
Next time when you go to the store, buy some black hair dye.
I eat the smoked tofu all the time (because it's hard to fuck up while cooking XD) and I can see where you'd get the ham resemblance. If you fry it, I find it smells exactly like bacon
Finding this channel by far is the best thing that's happened to me this year! Thank you for your amazing videos.
You're not supposed to store rice for too long after cooking it, and reheating it is unhealthy too!
Thanks for making this video. I've been not only looking for ways to stretch my budget but also some yummy recipes to help spice things up!  Yay Canada!
I'm gonna make that pasta salad today, you've really inspired me. Looks really delicious and cheap to make in bulk :)
Not even a vegan but I learnt a lot from this vid. Subbed!
Thank you for this video! I will definitely try it out. I might have to double de quantity of protein since I do exercice a lot.
Love this and its only 15 usd dollars! well 15.11 exact🤗
broccoli wokly
so did this make 3 meals a day for 5 days?
the weirdest feeling ive ever experienced was when i saw we have the same bowls....
I could've sworn that I had subscribed before! Lol good video!
More seasoning needed but good ideas
I don't eat a lot of broccoli, but have heard that it gives you gas, can anyone that eats broccoli confirm this? Thanks!
great video.. your recipe's are so easy and great. must try these. your dimples are so cute. i like the smoked tofu, it tasted like smoked mozerella.. it's so delish
dang! you're the only non-lame vegan. i feel like I can get started as I'm on day 3 of becoming a vegan. respect!
Oh my gosh...you are so lazy...just like me and vegan. I like you. Subscribed.
Def doing these recipes! Thanks so much they look delicious
isn't she missing some more food a week's worth for 1 person would be 7 breakfast bowls 7 lunch containers and 7 dinner containers 21 containers im sure your gonna need more than 20$ nice recipes though
You're super cool! Thank you!!
How many days does the tofu stay good for once it's cooked?
Dem US prices o.O I could get like spinach rice and pasta maybe for 20
Very Cool! Thanks for sharing.
I stopped watching when you said walmart
This was helpful recently discovered benefits of being a Vegan
I love you with that hair color !
Oh my god. I did it today and it was my first time that i ate smoked tofu. And thats soo delicous all of it. Thanks für sharing with us :D
New subscriber 🎈 LOVE your voice/face/hair 💁🏻loved this video too
"...but vegan food is always so expensive!"   -_-
Are u from Alberta because that Walmart looks exactly like the one in slave lake 😂
wow you are talented  thanks for sharing this with fabulous colors
Canada has tax on food!?!? That is ridiculous. In America, we aren't taxed on "essential items" food, clothing, and shoes.
wow! Good job!
love this video! simple, cheap, fast, easy...yesss im doing this
There's no tax on food :)
You guys like why are you wasting money on this crap? oh you'll see :P funny xD
Soooo awesome! These all look really good and actually doable.
im broke asf :(((((
VIDEO STARTS AT 2:07
i subscribed 💚
Why does bruising on bananas matter?
but u shopped at Walmart tho...a vegan that shops at a place that supports slave labor, all while eating gmos..ironic
Good job on the video. Your voice is very enjoyable.
oat meal for 2 of meals each day get 10 packets right? seen 5 upward containers though not scoped out everything.
make sure use up reduce rack things first. reduce going go bad soon.
I really want to go vegan because I want to be healthier and it seems really cool, but I'm worried that going vegan will be super expensive. Like, does it cost more for food than it does with non-vegans? Also, does going vegan make you healthier? I've heard it helps with your hair, acne, and body. I'm confused about the whole thing and reeeeealy need some guidance lol
wanted to tell you that I am a HUGE FAN of smoked tofu and if you go to Walmart like in this video, you can make an AMAZING pea soup.  my husband being a meat eating caveman did not even KNOW that it was a ham. it is so delicious. full of protein and fibre.  just do your peas with vegetable broth, onions,corn,carrots, ginger and or what you prefer and it is the perfect hearty meal.
I absolutely love your channel.  I am unemployed right now and my husband eats meat.  and I am tired of him saying being a vegan is expensive.  you are awesome.  two thumbs up
I'm really impressed. You have inspired me to save more money. I am new to vegan lifestyle and am transitioning slowly. At first I was watching the fully raw extremists like Dan and Kristina then Duriander. Your sensible way of being vegan makes more sense for my lifestyle. Thank you for sharing 😁.
why get instant.. why not just get the regular for just about the same price. either way.. awesome video!
oatmeal every morning .. yipeee
I'm so glad I found your channel! I loved this video! :)
Great video! I've had that smoked tofu twice now I think and I never thought it tasted like ham personally. :) I def need to meal prep more myself. :)
nice to see Canadian prices, thank you.
do you freeze the food after that or do they last in the refrigerator for 5 days? i mean, if I cook it Sunday will it last until Friday? 😱
For me personally, that little sachet of oats would not keep me full at all. Besides, it's full of unnatural sugars that aren't that great for you. You would have been much better off buying a container of rolled oats and maybe a jar of peanut butter to add into it :) That keeps me full for hours.
shoulda went with dry chickpeas if you're going for value!
Yay! I won't starve this coming week :)
It looks healthy and tasty and is, I love chickpeas, but this would last me two maybe three days. Are there tips for people who eat a lot 😂 and often
You should look into Egyptian Koshary. It's vegan, delicious and best of all CHEAP.
very nice video 😊very useful 🔆thanks
I'm not vegan, but I am willing to try these recipes for sure.
Fuck Crapmart .. Support quality grocers like Sprouts .. they actually care about their employees .. nice vlog though
Jesus loves you!
Omg I do instant oatmeal for breakfast too! I never need an intricate breakfast. Just something simple. And I feel you, a better lunch and dinner is where it's at!
Thank you so much! You did great! However, there is no way I can buy all these things for $15 in NYC :)
these recipe ideas are great- but she uses entirely too much salt. even if you eat clean vegan your entire life, you will still die early from eating too much sodium in your diet.
I like the variety you have ! and nice that it was 20 Canadian. . I'm going to try variations of these, trying to get away from using so much chicken as my protein since it's so pricey
whole food, whole food, not can food.
Walmart is EVIL!
This is a great video!  I have a lot of these things at home 😚😚
This is really smart. I love the transformations part because sometimes I have a small leftover and it's good for me but we are two and I live for transformations =) I also have a channel but I'm not vegan yet so meat does appear from time to time. If you want come take a look. Have a great day and a beautiful Christmas.
oh my goodness this looks like the Walmart plaza from my hometown!!!!! and this is soooo helpful!<3
I wish that I could handle so much carbs because this looks cheap. soo cheap and NOT boring.
This looks good
this was great thank you so much totally gonna try this
10:55 what song is playing? It sounds great! :)
Amazing!! I find the smoked tofu tastes like smoked salmon😝
DUDE what part of Canada are you from?? Because I'm in Toronto and tofu is literally like, $4 anywhere.
are these meal preps good for a weightloss diet??
Is there any way to eat more protein in a vegan diet, without smelling like a sewer? I always wait till the end of the day to eat my protein, as I'm usually in for the night...away from humans.
Omg I wish I could get broccoli reduced for a dollar! Here in Hawaii it gets reduced to like $3.99.
I Love this video 🙂🙂🙂 very inspiring! Love that you're Canadian as well 🙂
You can't reheat spinach!
i have a Korean market near me that has super cheap produce. I shop there every weekend and only spend about 50 bucks. i mean, they got napa cabbage 5 lbs for $0.99, korean peppers $1 a bag. and rice is $7.99 for 25 lb bag. they are local korean farmers that supply the veggies. still got dirt on it lol!
have you ever tried the morning star or gardien meats at walmart
Flipp app. get it.
How many meals are there total? I eat 3 main meals a day and at least 1 snacks. I think I would be hungry if I eat like this lol The food look colorful and delicious though.
I think it would of been fine to use basic pantry items to season your food, but I understood in trying to keep it pure to the $20.  Thanks for sharing.
I see canadian money... I see french-english translated products... ARE YOU FROM MONTREAL? :D
Subscribed :) love your vids and proud that you are canadian :D are you from montreal??
Subscribed :) love your vids and proud that you are canadian :D are you from montreal??
I'm kinda jealous. Where I live, 500g of baby spinach is NT$500! (US$15)
Fantastic!  Thank you!  Will definitely use this as inspiration!
Great ideas!  But make it organic and bpa free plastic.
Love your shot of the all the completed food together! THANK YOU! more$20 videos plls!!
OMG I LOVE THIS VIDEO!!! THIS GIVES ME SO MUCH INSPIRATION FOR MY HEALTH CHANNEL!!!
You got some good bargains there girl ☺
Including tax??  Is tax not included by the company?  Interesting
Broccoli wockly... That's the cutest thing ever..
Love it so much
You guys have pretty carts. We have gross silver ones where I'm at in the US :(
and one week has 7 seven days not 5 five as you said at the end!
did u say microwave? sheet jesus...........
the thing is ppl are talking and showing off that they are vegan and they go to the shop and buy stuff(packed).......its a lie, eat clean, go to farmers and get clean organic stuff. I saw vegan stuff from Unilever......such a joke:))
Nice I like it  Tnx
If you hadn't bought mustard and olives you would have money for more nutritious foods.  If you were trying to save money and survive.
Do they really taste taste the same after being frozen and reheated?
Definitely trying all these,  thank you for the ideas they look yummy! ☆
I just became vegan I'm glad you're page 😄😄😄😄
Smoked Tofu! Love it! And yes, to me it kind of tastes like bacon. Or whatever bacon used to taste like, I guess!
Wow!! Great imagination there I'm impressed!! Will definitely try this out as I wanted to go vegan.This video really helped,very beginner friendly Thanks for sharing.
I love this video :)
Will I lose weight if I eat this kind of diet?
I can't buy all these for 20$
nice! looks great!
Great video👏🏼 this is basically what i eat every day except one can of chickpeas or black beans goes for one or two meals..😅 i guess i'm eating alot 🙄
ok, I love that you're Canadian, because I legit wanted to see how I can save money and eat a bit healthier.
I thought pasta wasn't vegan
taco seasoning contains whey which is basically milk. non-vegan
Is everything we see in the video what you eat for a week or when you say x3 or x2 you mean that what you ate in a week was x3 or x2 what we saw in the video?
As a new vegetarian I've been overwhelmed the past few days with food planning and since I live with my parents and they do all the shopping, most of their food is meaty or dairy related. I am a vegetarian but I'd like to transition to vegan so I am super excited about this video because everything honestly looks so good, (I haven't tried tofu yet but I'm going to give it a shot) and it's all so cheap so tomorrow I'm going to do a little shopping and create this meal plan! Thank you for the inspiration!
Great video! What music did you use for the background?
At 48, how do I go vegan without my body "acting up"?
Walmart has organic 100 percent whole wheat spaghetti for 1.50 it's so good try it out. Aldo they sell organic beans for 89 cents.
Wow I am hooked finally something simple easy tasty and you're done my nickname is turbo says a lot so these are perfect thank you so much
To those who have a Sprouts near them: the bulk section would make this challenge so easy! you could probably include snacks for 20 US dollars. Lentil soup for daysss lol WOW I am so inspired now!
This is my favorite!!  Thanks for the ideas and for helping me to save money!
I am so impressed. I need to start meal prepping!
love ur vids! im a cheap lazy vegitarian trying to cut the dairy down
This was very helpful! thank you so much for sharing!
Awesome video.
Loved this!
Great video , very helpful .
Didn't realize you were Canadian! 😊 Ditto!
Ok. The pasta salad is interesting. I would just change up the broccoli, because my preggers belly doesn't like broccoli anymore (nor does it like a lot of veggies, the sucker). Dijon Mustard, the real dijon mustard that is sooooo strong you nose is on fire and your eyes water? I'm in. Definitely going to try!   The 2nd lunch is interesting too. I just don't like the consistency of tofu in sauce (i like it grilled, and that's it!).   Hmmm... Taco rice! What is in a taco mix, though? Do you know the ingredients by any chance? I have so many spices at home I'd prefer not to buy new ones, lol!    Thank you for the ideas, and I like the challenge, too! I would just tweak the recipes to my own taste. But I reaaaaaaaaaally really like the dijon mustard as a sauce idea. Like reaaaaaaaaaaaaaally like, lol.
Buying fresh fruits and vegetables would be cheaper than getting canned stuff.
Great meal ideas.  Thanks!
4.12  I spat my coffee out 😂
I like the way you combined food. Very smart!!!
Dunno where you are in Canada, but I am jealous you got that tofu for $2.50, as I'm on the west coast and have never seen it under $6.
i buy the garbanzo and lentils uncooked bags for like $1.50 and  after cooked you have more quantity of food than buying cans, of course this is not for lazy vegans :P
you're fun and resourceful... ty so much for this. smoke tofu rocks!  I discovered it by accident  and never let it go.  I used it to replace smoked Gouda  expensive not good for you... I find whee you used smoked ham in lentils and such just add cilantro and smoked tofu and bam!!!! I also eat it plan as a quick pick me up... toodles....  glad I came across your channel.
i giggled at your smileydressing :')
holy shit .. very impressive, variation is key 👌
Awesome video! That was so creative for so little money! One question, what camera/recorder did you use to film this video?
Talk about entertaining! What an awesome video. Thanks for sharing that with us. This was my first vegan research, so I'm on a new and long journey.
I TRY to share these kind of videos in order to help get animal eaters to see how easy & tasty our food is but I find it very hard to find videos where the person is not talking so much such as 20 minutes of talking for a 5 minute video is ridiculous AND we all know that animals eaters are hard enough to get to listen, 20 minutes of talking before the food is even shown will be ended within the first 30 seconds with them & there will be no turning back usually & THAT SUX!!! My point is, could you shorten all the talking so that we can get them interested please?
Are you in Calgary? That Walmart looks like the Walmart near my house :O
Looks healthy but really bland!
This is cheap for a tiny asian girl that consumes 1500 calories a day, now a bull that consumes 3300+ calories a day and goes to the gym, thats the question right there
I am a Canadian too
You are sooo freakin' cute ^^ just subscribed after watched only one video ^^ I look forward to try some of your recipes :D
I find the smoked tofu tastes like smoke Gouda cheese! I love it!
walmart = GMO FRANKEN FOOD
you're so awesome love the video
Hi there, great video! I just created a vegan channel as well and was hoping you could subscribe back to me. Best of luck and I'll keep watching!
I'm allergic to bananas. Are there any other filling fruits put on top of oatmeal? Something that's not berries?
Why do you/people rinse pasta after cooking it? I never do.  Do you have a bent pinky on your right hand?
Why is everything the brand Great Value for some reason that annoyed me so bad
Good stuff. Muchas gracias.
wow awesome !! thanks so much for posting this !
Couldn't finish once you arrived at Walmart. I enjoy my whole-foods local and fresh, not whatever the fuck mexico and china are trying to kill us with.
Excited to explore your channel. I am not a vegetarian nor a vegan. But as I get older I have started to notice that dairy makes me feel like ish.. and meat is so hard to digest. I have given up dairy and now I'm thinking of giving up chicken and turkey for good which is what I usually eat for meats. Excited to eat healthier :)
If you buy chick peas and black beans that are dried you could have such a larger quantity for cheaper
Can you make more of these!!😁
SMOKED TOFU TOTALLY TASTES LIKE HAM.
I'm so upset that Canadian money looks so damn beautiful
í never buy canned chickpeas anymore. í buy the dry ones and its so much cheaper (it takes forever to cook but I'm cool with saving the money because broke ass college student) also discovered chickpea flour to make my own tofu.
It really pains me to see all that extra plastic though, pfff, wouldn't it be easier, not to say less wasteful, to just stick a "reduced" sticker on those reduced price items? Go figure :P
Did you buy the smoked tofu at Walmart? Thank you for the video:)
is the pasta good?
great idea like it :)
Your meal prep is very inspiring but do you see ALL THE PLASTIC? Totally unnecessary.
Great ideas. I like the randomness too based on available ingredients.
Amazing! Thanks for doing this for us :D Also... I really like your voice.
wow its surprising how much stuff comes in plastic in Canada, even veggies!
looked loke either the Wal-Mart in Edmonton or Lethbridge
You are very cute
the prepkg'g oat meal is very lacking in nutrition & pretty sure she did not ck to see if these are non GMO/organic items I eat off 20. wk all the time but I eat fresh foods no can foods
... I hate salad.
I love your hair color!!
Literally drooling over this in the middle of the night
this is like $50 in nyc D:
going to multiple stores is not cheap, gas is not worthless and shouldn't be wasted. Also you seem to only eat once a day, which is obviously bad for you, if that's the case - that amount of food shouldn't last anyone a week. oats and beans are a good choice though, since it's hard to get any protein as a vegan.
ok i just made the easy af pasta salad (just w/o olives) and it's amazing! i didn't expect it to be so tasty :D mustard really is the key
Brilliant.
What does ham taste like?
yeah... i live in Québec so everything is really more expensive and  the tax is gonna kill it..
should of added almond milk instead of water for the oatmeal, it taste way better
Love this, thanks for the tips!
hey those look good..
that taco bean thing looked SOOO GOOD
I love your hair❤️ and great video
That Canadian $20 looks cool as fuck
Planing on starting a Vegan lifestyle any tips.new subie!
SO Canadian!!! My parents had the same bowls throughout my childhood.
Totally using these ideas, great job! :)
oh we could put a little 1$ sticker onto this Brokkoli OR WE WASTE A WHOLE FUCKING PLASTIC BAG THAT DOES THE SAME THING AS A STICKER
Are you in Ontario?  No Frills is the cheapest, but I tend to price match with Walmart, Superstore and Freshco when I'm there - we spend less than $100 / week for a family of 4 =)
Wow, awkward KFC ad I got before the video haha, also great recipes here, thanks ❤
I made the pasta salad. Instead of broccoli I used green onions and celery that need to be used in my fridge and lentils instead of the chickpeas. It was excellent.
Maybe it's because I've watched other vegan channels like Jessbeautitian and Hot for Food, but these meals seem so random and poorly planned. Sugar-laden oatmeal, and pasta salad dressed with mustard?!? Really?!?
Very inspiring!
I'm not vegan but I love to learn on how to save money and eat healthy at the same time bc I'm now spending 60 dollars a week only for me uh uh great video definitely learned some awesome tips 😍😍😍
Isnt it too much carbs?
hi Thanks for the recipes.  I am currently making rice and with the Mexican inspired sauce with beans from your video.  I am not vegan however I do want to eat more vegetables in a healthy way and so I am starting to make vegan meals and the whole family are so far enjoying them.
yummy! <3
Or u could have maybe the pasta salad with penne, peppers,cucumbers, olives & a Italian dressing
A good looking woman that can save me money is a turn on!
That taco bowl look good asf
Nice variety of flavors!
I need a gf like this!!
hey buddy looking good
I recently turned vegetarian about a week ago and I had tofu for the first time yesterday on my chipotle burrito and it was heaven better than the chicken I never really liked the chicken  chipotle used and great video ill defiantly be using this when I get money and a job.. I'm 15 still living with my parents
Loved this video!! So many great ideas :)
Good job but with a little more meal planning, you might have been able to get more variety of foods.
Where do you live
Won't work for people who eat organic like me but well done, you did great
For 5 days wow.. I could eat that in 1-2 days.. If a man eats that much for 5 days he will become so weak and low in energy.. Never save on food it is your health. You can skip buying iphones and other materialistic things but not food.
I'm Mexican and I had never before seen someone add beans to a tomato sauce and corn on top of that lol. It might look Mexican but it's not and I honestly think those three don't make a good combo.
Are you in st Catherine's????
Great job! You are a treat to watch. :)
uh oh, I just made, 6666 likes lol
love your voice and hair, facebook me :)
so hyped about it being in canadian dollars honestly
Thank you so much!!  $20 for five days is amazing and it all looked good.  I am new to the vegan thing and this is a great help.
You're very clever - these meals look great!
Even if you didn't get this on sale it's still awesome! I have a ridiculous grocery bill every month, especially around Christmas, my hubby buys 2 boxes of Boo Berries and devours a box a day 😣
Did you think about the cost of fuel in your attempt to spend the remaining 2.50?
I never see a reduced section of produce. that's cool you found the broccoli and spinach for a dollar each
OMG I loved to discover this channel <3 I'm starting vegan eating in february (when I move out because of parents) and for an university vet student I really wanted some cheap, quick and delicious recipes
wow. loved it all
best video ever ! thanks alot !
is that what you eat in a day or is every single meal meant for Monday - Friday
great recipes! im already excited to try this for next week :))
This was great but, lunch? I could have just missed it tho haha
KEEP IN MIND THAT YOU CAN USE COUPONS TO GET MORE BANG FOR YOUR BUCK, so to speak lol
BEST COOKING VIDEOOO THANK YOU <3
Love this video. I'm recently vegetarian and people always talk about how expensive it is. I just tell them they aren't buying the right things! lol I feel like I save alot more money not buying meat now. Canned beans and in season vegetables are my go tos. And bananasssss. So cheap.
When all of this would have been like $70 in Australia
That's pretty awesome. I eat a butt load tho
This video was SUPER helpful on so many levels;  vegan, Canadian, perfect for weight loss, healthy, easy, and cheap!
Canadian money is so cool looking.... I'm jealous
my guy says that when i eat tofu my breath smells like rotten veggies. he's not vegan like me so thats why i think he says that
I really appreciate this video!!
good job!
awesome meals! Seems a little bit like you'll be in a protein deficiency though. If you'd replace the pasta with soybean or blackbean pasta your body would feel a little better :) Or increase the amount of blackbeans!
Wow. I am super impressed! You are very creative (and to think of all these meals and how to transform them from one meal to another IN THE GROCERY STORE!). It takes me forever to think of meals at home. Thanks for the inspiration!
food is taxed in Canada??? whaaaaatttt??? thats weird. On another note, these look soooo gooooddd!!!
That's the Walmart I go too lol
I don't eat baby spinach. I eat grown up spinach.
I kinda lived vegan by accident the last week. The thing was just that I'm lactose intolerant, don't like eggs and the meat is so pricey in the country I moved to, so I just didn't buy any. I guess I might continue, but this time willingly.
Do you think it's cheaper shopping in the U.K.?
watching you was soo much fun!! <3
That's it I'm going to try this out. Thanks
you also can throw in some potatoes! if anyone like me.. doesnt like rice. haha
20 bucks is a challenge? I spend under 20 on my groceries every week as a vegan uni student!
Great job! Reminds me kinda of how I cook...just experimental and colourful and working with whatever.
👏 Awesome
Enjoyed the video! :)
is that the royal oak walmart in calgary?
That was neat xD plus you still had olives to snack on if you wanted.. And probably Spinach and broccoli and more rice and etc.. Even extra taco seasoning, so, you could definitely have enough for 5 to 7 days of meals. I love that there's leftovers. You probably could have even doubled up on the rice or pasta portions for filler. XD very cool! Even if you aren't a fan of dijon mustard or olives or whatever, there's still lots of options available. Good thinking!
Omg you're cute ❤️❤️❤️
❁ - I’m a new vegan YouTuber from Toronto, Canada trying to spread word about the amazing lifestyle!  If you like food videos and blogs follow me as I’ll be posting more frequently in the next coming weeks :) - ❁  … love your videos :)
Lol you got spoiled with budget shopping in England!!! I'd be interested to see how much the equivalent would be in Aldi. Great video.
does the food not get bad when you prepare it 5 days early? 🙈
Smoked tofu looks like gouda to me
Subscribed! I'm a poor vegan student so this is great :D
Don't use the microwave hun.
Is the food in Canada GMO Free?
This seems to be about 11,000 calories or 2200 per day, if anyone is curious.
afaik  food is cheaper from  local farmers.. the hard part is finding   local farmers
nothing like that in California...smocked tofu here it's almost $5 ...and not such a thing like reduced perishables -if something it's old they rather would threw them away then sell it for less...  BTW-I've just watched 2 or 3 lunch meals and 3 diner meals ,there was no way you can make 10 meals out of a can of chickpeas,corn and tomatoes! Probably the rest of the meals are just plain cooked rice and pasta,if any left :D
i like the idea but it what strange time zone do you live where your week has just 5 days? just write 5 days in the video description, that would be more honest.
how much money on gas for going"to some different stores"???
This was great. I always wanted to do meal prep so I don't always end up snacking on cookies and junk all day but never wanted devote one of my weekend days to cooking for hours on end. But this gave me a lot of ideas and is already similar to a lot of meals I already make. Never thought to keep adding stuff to the same pan to create meal variations!
The oatmeal does NOT look nice. It is supposed to look like that?
Um, I'm sure Dijon Mustard has Mayo in right?  Did take me a while to find a vegan one.
So weird I have never seen anybody make packets of oatmeal and not put them in the microwave I'll have to try them like that?!
Am i the only person who thinks that's a crazy amount of plastic or is that how it is in America! Saving the world in one way, destroying it in another.
I am gonna buy these exact things (except for the taco seasoning, I'll just use spices from my supply) and try to live on it for 5 days. This is a really great and inspiring video. Keep on making these, I love them :)
Wow did not know you were Canadian too! What province ?
This is great! Thanks😊
Just found your channel. Loved the video. What province are you from?
I'm not vegan but I'm looking forward to making and eating these meals, and I love their versatility!
yoo you should have done this at the dollar. I know you live in Ottawa
So impressive. A bit sad that I could never get food this cheap in Sweden though (at least not veggies or tofu). Might have to move abroad lol
Wow - you are amazing!  I am so impressed with your creativity!  Thanks for the inspiration!
Saw less than one minute of this video and I subscribed haha so grateful for videos like this!!!!
I am not even vegan but I am working on cutting out more meats and all of these meals look delicious. Definitely going to try them.
It would have been cheaper to buy a bag of rolled oats, and some brown sugar, non-dairy milk, cinnamon, etc...as toppings. Would last much longer, too. Instead of buying canned beans, it would be cheaper, and would last longer, to buy bags of dried beans. You only need to soak them overnight. Basically, put them all in different bowls, with the right amount of water, and by the morning, you will have beans to use for the entire week. I really want to try this though, I think you had some really great ideas, and I want to eat better on a budget. My problem always being that vegan has been costing me too much money.
Thanks for the helpful meal prep! I think these are great but I really do like more variety of fresh greens and fruits, so that's why im always spending $40 a week because of it
next time try Aldi in place of walmart....just a suggestion.
This all looks so good!!!
Super impressed!
Holy shit this is actually amazing. Im going to do this this week. Thank you!
I wonder if the red dye in her hair is made of vegan chemicals?
sorry, but WHAT Is with the bagging the reduced items in ANOTHER plastic bag? I admit i am struggling to reduce my plastic bag consumption but here in the states they just slap a price sticker over it.. they don't put the container in another bag..... wasteful
If you are looking to invest in cookware.. I would highly recommend saving up your nickles and dimes and buy an INSTANT POT electric pressure cooker.  You then could buy bags of DRIED beans (which are better for you AND less expensive)  and make lot of beans and rice dishes. and other things.  You can cook squashes, pasta, grains, beans all sorts of things.  I just made a pot of Congee porridge which is cheap.  Lot of good eating.. but thanks for the video.
Thanks for the video! I made these for the week ahead, all turned out great!!
I can't get any of that shit for that cheap. organic baby spinach that size is like 4.99 in nyc
vegans are not allowed in a wall mart
u talk too much
This vid is saving my poor college student life lol thanks for posting!!
Haha I only have oatmeal in the morning also.
Awesome video! The only question I have is, if you could sub mustard what would you sub with (I hate mustard xD) ?
That was inspirational, thanks! I don't know if I could buy that much for GB £12, but one never knows. I love that you use value brands - interesting to know they're available in Canada. I use a lot of them here too, but, like you did, just simple, single foods, not the composites like pasta sauces etc. Wish we could get value wholegrain stuff here in the UK, but I have to pay full price for my brown rice and pasta. :(  Now I'm *really* wishing we had a decent sized freezer instead of just a large-ish ice box in the fridge. Maybe we could fit one in downstairs after all....
I love your idea of adding hot water to bowl of broccoli. Great for feeding those who don't like raw but still keep most of the nutrients.
bruh it costs like £12 just to get to the shops and back in London
Great video for us vegans that are on a budget!
Your pasta salad looks delicious.
This actually made it a little easier for me to decide what I was going to make for lunch :)
thanks good video
Yay! Love a Canadian Vegan Vid :^)
This is one of the most amazing meal prep videos I've ever seen. Like I actually plan on going out And buying similar ingredients and try this out. I've never meal prepped before because it didn't seem easy enough to me.  Thank you so much for this video ❤️
thanx for the tips, you got a new subscriber!
Just because u added taco seasoning doesn't make it mexican LOL smh
this was seriously so inspiring. Thank you!
very impressive!
Subbed. Excellent video. To save more money in the future, buy beans by the pound and cook them yourself. I'd also recommend buying the oats straight from the barrel.
This is so helpful because many people think being a vegan is expensive and you have just proved that it is not , thank you
Oh ma gawd! That first pasta salad looks so good! I wish I wasn't boring af with my food cuz I wouldn't think to make that on my own.
VEGANS please answer a couple questions about your religion  Are you no "better" than any other animal? All animals should be treated exactly the same?  Should I kill a murdering meat eating animal? (To save vegan animal lives)  (No point asking whats required for a balanced diet as vegans are extremely ignorant on this subject) Nice non balanced recipes for the week tho
Not trying to be a negative nancy, but the great value brand of taco seasoning contains dairy. We found that out the hard way with dairy allergies
awesome. I'm always looking for cheap easy vegan meal recipes and yours rock! keep up the good work.
You also could save the liquid from the chickpea can and use that to make vegan mayo with the mustard you bought, if you also buy some oil. The mayo could be used with the pasta salad, or added on top of any of the other dishes for a little creamy fatty addition. Lots of other ways to use bean liquid too, and great to utilize when you're vegan and on a budget.
Walmart does NOT have cheap produce. Try a farmer's market.
Useful video!  Mind you, food is more expensive here in the UK than it is in Canada. Also, I would (and my boyfriend certainly) probably eat more than that, if I'm honest, so I could probably get away with spending $40 equivalent for a week.  Awesome video, though!
For anyone on a budget, buying dried beans in bulk is way cheaper than canned. More work/time/prep, but cheaper by far. And rice, oats, pasta and any grain  in bulk (not prepackaged like hers) is much cheaper if you're truly struggling. We can't afford luxury items at speciality health food stores, but that's where we get our bulk ingredients
This is the first video of yours that I watched randomly but rest assured I'm already subscribed and loving your other videos. Keep up the great videos!
That was so awesome to get all that food for 20
I live for dijon mus!
I buy frozen veggies, it's a lot cheaper and I don't have to throw it away because it's rotten. Oatmeal here cost €0,40 for a 500 gram bag! I live in Holland.
Everything is so expensive in greece
that taco seasoning does not have milk powder in it ?
they tax on food???
Suggestion for challenges like this to save money, instead of getting oatmeal and a rice or grain for lunch/dinner savory meals, you can make some sweet "rice pudding" with fruit and whatever you want to throw in there.
SW Chickpea salad: Chickpeas Black Beans Cilantro  White corn  Squeeze of lime juice Pepper & salt Olive Oil avocado Yummmmmmmmm
love this please do more in the future:)
Terrific video! So helpful. Glad I stumbled upon your channel. My whole family is vegan (newbies) and they don't love veggies1 Ugh...its tricky. 3 sons are 19, 12 and 11 plus my hubby and my mother in our household. I am really the sole veggie lover. They are all about the carbs. Each decided on his own to go vegan this past June. So we're wading thru trying to make it work. We did vote to add eggs back into our diet but we go to a friend who has truly happy hens who have run of the very big yard and basically do whatever they want. And they lay eggs. She gives them non gmo, soy free food and scratch so I thought that wasnt too bad. I LOVE videos with ideas, esp easy ideas. My hubby said to just make what I like, incl. beans, that they all dislike, and he says they'll all just learn to like it. Thats what im going to try so they don't live off of cereal, baked potatoes, french fries, scrambled eggs and guacamole with chips! ha! I just subbed to your channel. Looking forward to some binge watching. Peace and God bless -
I put peanut butter in my oatmeal, so I don't have to do a 2nd pouch.
I love the Frozen Section at Dollar Tree, it's amazing what you can find that.
This video is amazing!! You have a new subscriber :)
bulk oatmeal would of been even CHEAPER!!
a lot of pasta has egg
Look I don't want any negative hateful comments. I'm not judging at all. But I just want to stress the importance of trying to eat as much organic as you can. the chemicals which with conventional produce is produced is just so harmful to our bodies and the environment. I know organic isn't always cheap and accessible but where you find you're able to splurge a little more, try to. I work at a whole foods and a lot of times we have promotions going on with organic produce and some (not all) ends up being cheaper than conventional. just to everyone who doesnt, try to think of it a little. no judgement, no hate, I just care.
youre supposed to measure the water with the line on the oatmeal pouch and the extra crumby stuff helps to thicken it up later on 😁
this is a such a great video... thanks
subbed
I just started eating vegan this week and I'm wondering is the oatmeal still vegan even tho the box says "may contain traces of milk and egg"? I keep seeing this on labels and decide not to get the items if they say that..   *I know that the manufacturer has to put those warning for allergen reasons*
finally canadian meal prep thanks alot
Really random, but is that Walmart in Burlington? 🤔
Love your videos :) <3
The food looks good but it is truly lacking seasonings and other spices. There is definitely a lack of fat in these meals. The only fat I've seen has been with the tofu and olives. These  meals may not keep you full!
love smoked tofu!!! definitely reminds me of bacon cuz of the liquid smoke
I bet that you toot alot
This is so helpful! Thank you!! <3 I love that you have Canadian brands and prices too, so many food bloggers from USA
Impressive!!!
this video is amazing. I love all your ideas- they are cheap, fast and you can freeze your food for later- perfection!
this didn't look like 5 days food....
very good, congratulations.
Oh man, you need an Aldi up there!  Waaay cheaper than Wally World and they have lots of organic options.
wow! Rose, you are so adorable!!!~~~
This was great! Genuinely low budget, realistic meal sizes and food that actually looks like something most people would eat- not to mention easy/quick. And I like that you didn't use anything extra other than salt (I agree with you, salt is totally different- everyone has salt). Most bitches be like "and i'm just adding a dash of truffle oil to this because I happened to have it in my cupboard"
wow! it's not easy to make a $20 five day prep...even harder to use the same ingredients in a different way to keep it creative. You did great!
awesome video. just sub'd 👍
great video love it
Love this video!! You did that!! With just $20 bucks...though!! The food looks delish!! Thanks for sharing!!
Love the intro!!
please do more videos like this! i've been searching for cheap weekly meal plans for ages and this was perfect :)
Very Informative video. Thanks for sharing your recipes
Tofu looked like flan 🍮 lmfaoooo
Hahahahaha!!  In India even the poor go to vegetables market and buy vegetables... You eat for some weeks what this lady shows and sure you all will get a he'll of a cancer and other diseases!!  Developed country!!!  Hahahahhahaha
Clever girl 👍🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Thank you. One for being Canadian and more realistic for me as a Canadian and then secondly, for making food that I would totally make in the little time I get to prep! So REALISTIC! Haha thank you!! You're awesome!
no flavour and fix the sound quality in your video.. you talk so low and the background music is way too loud.
Not to be rude or in any way offensive, but I'm a picky eater and I like how some of the meals looked but I feel like they lack flavor.
Girl! This video is pumping me up to get more creative with my vegan venture. You got a new subscriber, thank you.
an easy and affordable vegan dish would be casamiento with a side of fried yucca. Very filling.
Wow - if everyone ate like this, they'd be so healthy, and the planet would be so much better off.  Absolutely brilliant video - such fun and you're a natural talent!  Veganism rocks!
Thank you for the video!
Every dish looks really good and easy to make. I am definitely going to try. I've never had smoked tofu.
Wow! People can save hundreds of dollars a year by eating like this.
that mfin dijon mustard smiley face will haunt me in my dreams
i dont know when you filmed this, but on the spinach it says best before oct 2 so i assume it's reduced because it was nearing its expiration date?
Hi! I inspired myself to make cheap burritos with what you show here! :) I went to walmart and got brand names of chick peas, diced chili tomatoes, iceberg lettuce and tortillas (pack of 10 the big ones)! I also used 2 onions that I had at home from a big 10 pounds bag that I got a 2$ on sale some weeks ago! I cooked my 2 onions with the tomatoes and all chick peas with some salt and pepper. Once the onions were tender I squished some of the chick peas to thicken everything up and get rid of the water. I put 2 big scoops in each tortillas with a huge handful of chopped lettuce! Depending on your appetite it can make you from 4 to 8 meals I think! I'm a big eater so 4 for me! :D  Chick peas: 0.77$ Tomatoes: 1.00$ Lettuce: 1.00$ (it was on sale! Yay!) Tortillas: 3.40$ Onions: From my big bag probably 0.20$  And most important of all! The only dishes I had where a cutting board, a knife, a wood spoon and a pan! Too many videos never talk about the damn dishes! "You'll save so much time... that you'll spend cleaning!" I love love love how you cook eeeeverything in one pan! lol
😘
I'm so happy I found you 😍
where do you live? i live in Halifax and get the smoked tofu all the time! it reminds me of ham too, and i use it in recipes to replace smoked salmon. i made a caesar dressing with it and it was the best thing in the world!
I gotta say, the pasta salad is kick ass! First time trying Dijon mustard as a dressing, I've never been so stoked to eat a salad!
This was GREAT! THANK UOU♡♡♡
I think this was incredibly helpful. Mine might be a little more expensive because I'm a larger woman and eat more than that on a typical day, but thank you very much for making this video. I'd love to see more like this.
You're so beautiful <3 My kids love the smoked tofu, there's a new one out that is more flavored (garlic and pepper I believe) that I prefer to the plain one. I love cutting up regular extra firm tofu and baking it in the oven plain with salt and pepper.
This is so great. I get so weary of not eating organic though. I mean, none of this was organic. I don't want to see like a snob, but seriously hope you aren't eating like this all the time (and it was just for the challenge). There's a lot of toxins in these meals you made.
Great buy.
Thank you for the video! Do you live in Calgary? It looks like you went to Royal Oak Wal-Mart and Country Hills Super Store.
Use the app Reebee! It's amazing to know what's on sale all in one place and then you go to Maxi (if you have it where you are in Canada) and you can show the lowest prices from the other grocery stores on the app and get it to this price.  It's so useful.
I love your channel. You are so helpful.
I think ur money conversion is wrong because USD should be much higher than CAD currency
Girl YASSSSSS!!! 💚😘🙏🏾
Lol @ the $1 broccoli. I wish I would find stuff like this again. In Japan right now where about 100g of broccoli is already $1. I really miss the large amounts of broccoli I used to eat at home :/
Did you get the smoked tofu from walmart, i need to buy this,some of the Wal-Mart's don't carry it ?
I'm so jealous of your hair, it is beautiful. Thanks for the video.
Ah yes, I needed some good recipes. This looked great so I went out and bought pretty much exactly the same, except I couldn't find smoked tofu so I just got regular. I'm making slightly bigger portions and it cost $35.19 from Kroger so not too bad. This will save me from having to eat the rest of my Soylent experiment, LOL!
Everything looks delish. I think for future vids like this, you should allow spices and things like soy sauce to be outside of the budget because people usually already have those things in their cupboards.
plus i watched this just in time my food stamps are coming in on monday
love this video i live in a basement where the landlord wont let me use the kitchen and all i have is a crockpot and microwave so these sound great to me.
Cool video! Out of curiosity do you happen to have a Freshco near by you? If you're ever looking for cheap beans and other vegan essentials, they have a pretty good selection. I sometimes find walmart too pricey for some of the food stuff (which it's weird to type that cause walmart is suppose to be like the cheapest place ever :/).
i once veganised a traditional dish for my family and subsituted the bacon with smoked tofu. my dad (carnivore #1) said it tasted "just as good as the real thing", and he is usually quite outspoken when it comes to denouncing food he doesn't like. i love smoked tofu, especially when you fry it with onions! *.*
Looks really great, except for the tofu. But I think it wouldn't be enough to eat for five days....
Tbh I wouldn't eat that.
Do y'all have an aldi? It's cheaper than Walmart to me
Love this video! So practical and I really appreciate your commitment to only using the ingredients you bought!
Is instant oatmeal cheaper than old fashioned oats + some apples? Cuz instant oatmeal is wayyyyyy more expensive than the ones that require cooking here in Hong Kong!
Bravo! to showing vegan meals are affordable and easy. well done:)
it tastes like ham because of the smokiness. I often use smoked paprika in soups for this effect and it works out great.
Not trying to dis you I enjoy your videos but you may want to check out the oatmeal because I don't think it is vegan -it has natural flavors which is often a big clue that it is not vegan and also may contain traces of egg and milk and sometimes the vitamin sources are animal.
Yeah!!! meal prep video again!
Id be starving if I only ate this little ....
Omg, are you kidding me with the broccoli?! Just one broccoli "tree" is worth about 2 canadian dollars here in Sweden... x) If I could get a whole bag for 1 dollar I'd be in heaven!
It's what we keep telling everyone who thinks it's expensive to be vegan. Rice, pasta, beans and vegetables. So many people think you have to buy all the ridiculously expensive fake meat and cheese products.
Another option is to add the spinach to the pasta while it's hot and let the spinach wilt. I personally just like it better that way.
Did you know the greens you are eating are the animals food source so you are potentially hurting the animals.
I was eating bacon while watching this.
we don't have a reduced produce pile at my walmart
Great video !  New Sub !
You're so cute, Rose! HUGS from Ana and Aubrey (in Texas!)
Your meal prep is so colourful! I wish I had the discipline to eat meal-prepped food. Super epic cheap haul 👍
Definitely making that pasta salad next week for work lunches!
New subbie! You're so amazing ❤️
so I casually stumble upon this video, check it out and am so glad I discovered you! subbed. on a side note, I just purchased a set of cookware from amazon and it happens to be the one you're using lol
did you plan all this in the store? this is so well thought out! wow!
I buy dried pulses and beans and make them its kinda cheaper i think
I luv your purpose and your coat💜
Great video! :
to me smoked tofu has the flavour of smoked salmon. which makes sense as they're smoked products. I don't get a ham vibe
You did a great job, was surprised because everything you made looks a lot like what I would have on a regular bases.. My only suggestion would have been dry beans to cook yourself and a container of oats instead of the individual envelopes.
I wish US grocery prices were as good as the one's I've seen in southern Ontario and Quebec 😭 I live in Rochester, NY and food is so expensive here.. They really make it hard to eat healthy on a budget here!
Great stuff! "Eat ur first lunch first..." LOL =D
Great video. I made almost an identical video a month ago☺
If you got dry beans and long cooking oats great job on the reduced pile
Great video, I can't believe that smoked Tofu is only $2.50 in Canada. I think I need to come over and visit Walmart. ASDA is great all but it's not the same 😂.
Old fashioned oats, I make mine always with water and might add half a banana or other berries from freezer. The packets you bought makes soggy oats and you pay more than buying a smallish container of store brand old fashioned oats, which really take less then five minutes to cook, regardless of the instructions...
Hi, I just met you, and this is craazy; but I'm subscribing, 'cause you're awesome, lady!
So simple yet so good!
So cool! Good ideas, Rose! <3
I think it was really great that you used just salt except for what you actually bought (Y) In most other challenges I've seen they cheet with this and use lots of sauces and spices.
don't use plastic containers. they are not healthy and furthermore they ruin the savour of dishes. glass is the way to go :)
This is so cool! Cant wait to try it out! :)
This. Video. Is. A Godsend.
if people tell me that they cant be vegan because it is too expensive to afford as a college student, I started to just show them your videos. it can be so easy :)
amazingggg!!!
Smoked tofu kinda tastes like bacon to me...which is weird since I love smoked tofu but I rarely ate bacon pre-vegan. Always enjoy your videos and your red hair (saw your instagram earlier about wanting to change it)
I just want to show this to all the people that say being vegan is expensive
Most vegans are pretty militant about BPA in my experience. You aren't worried about it I take it with all the cans? Keep up the good work! :)
Noooo cooking broc in water strips it of nutrients it's pretty much non nutritional unless you drink the water or use it for stock or some shit
love this video. look amazing.. i 'm a wal-mart girl shopper.. we also have another, store, that's inexpensive foods, and bulk items.. called winco.. i'm about a bargain. but good food.
I love this! So doing it this next week.
Super excited about the Canadian aspect !! Alberta vegan here - great ideas for so cheap, love it!!!
Superstore? Are you in Atlantic Canada?!
What an original video idea! I really enjoyed it 🙂
Awesome!
oatmeal for breakfast would be really hard to do. I'd probably prefer granola bars.
Very helpful, thank you!
Oooo I'm going to have to try that cold pasta salad!!!
also i feel like corn was kind of a waste seeing how it's not really nutritious. ..maybe like canned carrots? or turnips, or beets...
really nice job.. I'm just like "I'd eat double that" and I'd need more fruit :o
Great video.... Love itGoing to try this out after the Canadian Thanksgiving weekend.
inspired and inspiring! thanks!!
I love Rose!
I feel like such a moron. I didn't realize that Walmart had stores in Canada *facepalm*
So creative ! Love it
Rose, I absolutely loved the blue bowl you put the pasta in, it is so beautiful!!! Once again a great video! Keep on doing what you do!👄👄
Smoked tofu may taste to you like ham but because most ham is smoked or brined even when its not stated. So it doesn't taste like ham it tastes like wood smoke.
Italian tomatoes with taco seasoning?  Love the Rose mixes!
do you still use plastic bags?! this is really inspiring though!!
I love your videos with challenges to eat well spending just a few dollars. It's amazing how you come up with so many nice recipes spending only 20$!
And here I am after months of watching meal prep for the week videos and I still haven't done a single meal prep XD Love watching the vids though!
That smoked tofu is AWESOME! Makes great "TLT" sanniches. :)
Did you check the ingredients on the oats? In the USA the instant pouches usually include dried milk powder.
love this! definitely wouldn't mind seeing more videos like this lol
You are so good at meal prep!!!! Bless your soul
I practically live in the reduced produce section of grocery stores.   we have four different stores in my town and I'll hit them all up early in the morning right after they mark everything down.. I get bananas for 11¢ a lb a bag of baby kale for a dollar baby spinach for a dollar and whatever else is available. this week I scored some plantains and butternut squash for 79¢ each so yay!!! and vegan flat bread!!! I tried a sandwich I saw here. I think you made it peppers kale spinach w garlic salt n pepper on flat bread spread with tomato paste.  omg yum!!!!!!
so so tired but still out here trying to get noticed. staying true to my name. grind.
thanks for doing one of these. Love it.
This is awesome! We're broke don't qualify for food stamps, really struggling to find cheap food.
I'm thinking of starting a vegan cooking YouTube channel do you guys have any tips?
This is awesome.👅🍽
Rose............! Your Awesome!!
my gosh love where do you live??! I'm in the GTA :)
And I was so worried because I spent 54 dollars on food last month... (of course not living in Canada)
Will make this this next week as I'm poor this month. YUM. As always thanks and hope you are enjoying Canada.
You're a totally AWESOME vegan U tuber.....u ""really really"" are.......1 dolla.....you're so CUTE!!!!
so you freeze them and eat them throughout the week? i should start doing this there are days that i barely eat anything because im too lazy to make food😅
your videos inspired me a lot!! i love cooking and your ideas are great :)
these are my favorite type of your videos. I'm so glad to see another one finally!
That's actually exactly what I thought about the taste of smoked tofu when I first tried it! 😄🙏🏻
Yes, I love this! I'm seriously about to do this for next week. I may spend a little more on breakfast but still if it would keep me at around $30 I'd be stoked!
Great video :)
Starch-based is for sure the best on a budget! Potatoes, beans, rice and pasta are dirt cheap. You've inspired me to try out a challenge like this. :D
Please repeat this in the future :) XO Davita
"Easy asf pasta" LMAOO
What would you eat for lunches? You just made 5 meals 😆
Wow 🙈 this would cost me a lot more € in Slovenia 😆
My goodness the food looks delicious!! I'm going to make what you made as well!
Are you in Victoria?
Omg this is sooo helpful! I am a vegan who is always broke xD Thanks! :D
Girlfriend this is exactly why you are one of my favorite utubers of all time!!! I'm going to challenge myself to do the $20 haul too!!!
full week = five days. okay, I learned something new here =P
How much more money do you think would've been left if you'd bought the chickpeas and black beans dried instead of precooked? It adds on time to meal prep but would it have made a significant difference?
not enough food for a guy haha. awesome vid though good meal ideas
New intro? LOVE!! It's light and pretty. Anyway great prep. It's a "throw everything in a pot kind of week" which is great because these meals were like under 15 minutes. =D
What a great idea! I'll definitely try it for the upcoming week! Thanks for sharing.
Thank you for the inspiration you give :)
Rose, you never cease to amaze me! This proves you don't have to spend hours planning and making prepared meals. also I love your voice overs :P
yaay, you're here! hi Rose! I love your grocery hauls and food preps, you have awesome ideas and make everything look so delicious! I'm going to buy the smoked tofu, never tried it before. I usually get the regular one and use chili powder, garlic powder and paprika when I make mine.
Really helpful thank you!! I'm gonna try just putting Dijon mustard on my pasta salad :))
this is so helpful and awesome!
you. are. amazing.
"i'm just going to the store" YES stan for carly rae jepsen!!!!!
yes, I loved smoke tofu and yes, it sort taste like ham
Do you have any tips for vegans who have low blood pressure? Like what to eat for fatigue or dizziness, especially on period days.
you inspired me to turn vegetarian, and hopefully ill become vegan in the future! as you said it takes baby steps <3
are you back in Canada? woww so cool
Canadian dollar notes are so pretty! And thanks for the ideas!! Im keen for Sat Meal Prep day to come around!
