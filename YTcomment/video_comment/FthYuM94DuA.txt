Thanks Anne Marie ❣️
So did she let the yellow poison leak out first?
Can we make this soap with a melt and pour soap base? If yes, please let me know the proportion and shelf life of the soap. Thank you.
Do we need to cut the sharp needels in the aloe vera or not plz reply
Nyc watching Ur video Pls what is super fat
I made this soap and it is awesome.  Good hand washing soap, especially during covid-19  Does not dry your skin at all.  My family loves it.  Good for bathing as well.
DO I have to use the liquid in addition to the actual plant material?  thanks
I love it the ideia of making soap with Aloe purée! But if my mold has other size how I calculate how many of Aloe Vera juice and purée? Thanks 🙏🏽
This recipe is superfat at 5%?
Hi Annie...it's amazing. Loved it. did u used aloe Puree and aloe juice 5oz+ 13oz distilled water...or 13oz-5oz= 8oz as distilled water ...
Is it better to the leafs on or off
When do you put the Aloe vera puree & liquid in ? You didn't in the video.
Who came here after watching Safiya's video?
Hi Annie how many % aloe vera gel would you recommend for 1kg oils ? Thanks :)
Hello, doesn't the green aloe peel irritate the skin?
Hi. Can I use aloe gel instead of the liquid?
Thanks for all your efforts sharing the video with your recepie which make easy to learn not any soap maker share the recepie . I love all your video. god bless you.
I loved this video! Cannot wait to try my soap :)
💐🙏🏼😇🕉💖
Hi. I’m new here..  Can I use aloe Vera gel?
Why put aloe vera peel in too?its suppose to irritate the skin!
I am just excited to watch you do soaps. I want to make soaps also to start a small business but I am from the Philippines.  I think I will find it hard to get all the ingredients to use.
hi, do you add the sodium lactate to the lye water?
Hey Ann Marie, what do you think about substituting aloe vera liquid for distilled water?  Also, could it be added as an extra- separate from the oils or would it potentially mess with the chemical composition of the soap? Thank you :-)
kindly share the link of soap making for beginners.  thanks
Beautiful. Can I order liners for my homemade molds
hi, may i ask why you rarely put any preservative (paraben, phenonip, etc) into your soaps? will it last long? for how long? isnt organic soap need preservative? thank you in advance for your kind respond... :)

hi Anne Marie. can you do a video on making liquid soaps, body wash, and bubble bath. please and thank you
How are u not dead from the smell, when I walk into a soap shop I literally can't. You are my role model
I agree cutting the soap is so satisfying!!
very beautifull.
Hello :) I was wondering if it is possible to make cp soap clay. Here's a video of a youtuber using the clay https://youtu.be/N0O9nR8DLpU   The ingrdients of this clay only says cp soap, cornstarch, distilled water, colorant and fragrance oil. The soap has already been cured for 4 weeks and is soft until you dry it overnight, which is then as solid as any other normal cp bar. I have been researching and trying to make this soap clay forever but I haven't gotten how do it yet. It would be awesome if I could get help from a professional. Thank you!
I love your videos they are so relaxing 😂💖
I need help. I would like to know how to calculate the total organic ingredients in a lotion.
make some shower jelly video!
Is it just me or was the screen fuzzing ?
Can I used lye that it's sold in hardware stores?
Love the hair! So glad you're back
hi Ann marie can you give me some ideas for perfume that I can make for mothers day
Hi Ann Marie what would be the ratio of butters and oils I am able to use? I have the lye calculator do I just put my ingredients in and allow it to calculate?
Hi Ann Marie...just started getting into soaping and love it. Thank God for the videos and tutorials!!! My question: when using colors, do you figure the oil in to the entire recipe or is this extra that won't bother the balance? Grazie!!!
thank you for new video update after such quite a long....i'm your fan.. love to try this recipe with skin of alove.   but will try with hp...coz cannot wait for result....thank you
Hi Ann Marie... I'm a newbie and "LOVE" your videos. I'm also getting ready to order my supplies from Brambleberry. One question I have is.. "Once I have made my first hot process loaf , about how long do I safely have to wait  to cut it ? And once I do cut it ..should I package it immediately? Thank you so much for your expertise and time. LOVE YOU..SUSAN
Annmarie you and your videos have taught me how to make soap. I love it! thank you for sharing your knowledge. It's truly a gift.
Yayyyyyy you're back!!!!
That soap is really beautiful! I haven't ventured into using colors or fragrance oils yet, but want to. I do have a fairly large aloe vera plant that I got for the purpose of adding to soap. :) Over all, I think I'm better at the technical side of soap making than the artistic side.
I did it this afternoon with my fresh Aloe vera.... sensational!
😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉
I usually don't include the skin of the aloe, just the jelly part! Is it skin safe?
Turned out gorgeous!!!
You are lacking a hairnet.  I wouldn't want somebody else's hair in any product that I buy.
Those goggles though haha
yaaaay your back. hope all is well.
how bout a video using regular soap base to achieve these patterns. when I say regular soap base the already prepackage soap just to melt n ad color n scent
aww what happened to the soap queen microwave?
Do more melt and pour videos,  love your channel
I love ur videos 😍sorry haven't been here for a while
These videos are so relaxing to me. I watch them before bed even though I've never made soap, lol. Thank you for doing what you do! ❤️
this  is by far my favorite soap making channel. thank you! would this soap be good to use on your face on a daily basis?
You're talking YAAAAYYY!!!😜😍😍😍😍😍
Are you okay you sound different than usual
YAY! longer video❤️❤️❤️❤️
Ok thanks for the longer video! Lol
Hi ann I don't plan on making this soap any time soon but I do hope to in the future I'm allergic to coconut all forms but other oil can I use to replace it? I do like the recipe though
There is poison in the leaf unless you let it sit in cold water you could mess up your skin
Very pretty. I've used aloe Vera in soap before and it was nice.
I want to try this. It looks pretty cool. How much money do you save by making your own soap?
much better cx
I love watching these videos! where can I get that mini blender though? I'm having a hard time finding one.
This is great I just bought an aloe Vera but I can't do cold process soap because I can't buy stuff from online
Why do you not upload often? Jw
hi ! can you teach us to make shampoo bars like the ones from lush ???
The bloopers at the end really made the video even better than it already was! I love how clear and precise your directions were, it really helps out newbies like me! Lol! Keep up the good work!
Hey girl! Where can you acquire some of those hefty goggles?!
I love all of these videos. There are so many different ways to make soap. With all the different colors and scents, I'm definitely going to try cold process soap soon!
Love this idea, I've done aloe Vera soap and loved it but I used just the inside gel part of the leaf I didn't realise you could use the skin as well. Does it have more beneficial properties if you use the skin as well then ?  xx
