I like rum baba.
Nigella is so incredibly sexy.
This came up when I did a search for a keto olive oil cake.. going to make this instead tonight. Have you ever done a video of an olive oil  cake? Not seeing one come up..
Black forest cake is my favorite
actually, I even watch recipes of you that I wouldn't ever do (bc of the eggs or meat) , just to see your reaction at the end of that video! awesome!
Its a no from me because of raw egg whites salmonella!
I’m very trepidatious about the raw egg yolks. Help me.  As for my favorite dessert ... my answer is ‘yes.’  Enough jibba jabba ... just keep giving it a good mix, my friend.  💋🤘🏼♥️
looks like the chocolate broke, but that can usually  be fixed by mixing.
Forget to tell you I'm a chocoholic 😍
Love your recepies, and always wait until you taste it it's hilarious, and also to tasted myself .......... yummmmmmmmm
Why dont the Indians eat eggs? A religion thing?
keto apple pie? xD
I like egg but raw, don't know. Cadbury's Turkish delight. We have it in Australia. I love recipe for this
Can I used extra virgin olive oil instead of olive oil? TIA.
Apple Crisp is my favorite, but be surprised if you could figure out a way to Keto that. Also Dutch Letters. Special treat when I can get to Pella Iowa here in the USA. To expensive outside of Pella, but reasonable in the town. All that flaky, sweet, almondy  goodness. YUM!
Hey I am a nurse and on covid 19 duty... I have no leaves n got no microwave as well... I am dying to eat a keto layered cake chocolate n vanila combined ... And please include instructions on how to cook on gas stove without a microwave... And please include the link of online shopping sites where we get the ingredients ... As m posted in a village .. awaiting ur recipe...n please include frosting and cream layering in the middle n a chocolate mouse cake too
After my concern with olive oil making my own mayo, I used avocado oil in this recipe. Works great! Thank you!
Wow!  Looks fabulous.  I think key here is to use a virgin olive oil for general purpose.  An extra virgin oil will be from one type of olive and is usually not blended and will have a stronger taste.  Virgin olive oil is usually blended with other olive oils from a variety of different olives.
Peanut butter pie
Wow Sahil this recipe is to die for. We have 4 favorite desserts:  blueberry pie (any berry), profiteroles, pudding and ice cream.
use deep bowls man helps a lot with the texture especially if you're not doing it by hand
My favorite dessert from my childhood is a Native American recipe called Sioux Pudding.  But, it might be impossible to make it Keto.  :-(  Love your channel!
In the US, we have some food disease problems that weren't a real problem 20 years ago-- so it's probably best to use pastured eggs if you make this in the US.  :-)
Hhhhhh I’m not Indian but I don’t like recipes with eggs 😌😌😌😌😌
Pumpkin cheesecake pie is my fave. I took the canned milk out and replaced it with cream cheese ... my family loved my pumpkin pie but they love this even better but there's so much sugar I can't have it anymore. Rice pudding and cinnamon rolls with chopped nuts rolled up inside (my mom would always put raisins and chopped walnuts in hers).
Make some Portuguese custard tart (I don’t know the exact name) and banofee pie please 😋😋
Cream Horns are one of my favorites to eat. Its a puff pastry horn covered in sugar crystals with whipped cream in the middle. I pretty sure it would be close to impossible to make keto haha. thanks for the recipe. Looks amazing!
USA...INDIANA....Official State Pie. .. Sugar Cream Pie!!!!  Yummy 😛❤😛❤😛  Here's your challenge!
Tirimasu!!!
I think a keto version of Rasmalai should be possible. Would love it if you could do that. 😊😊😊😊😃😃😃
Errr Sukrin Gold really expensive lol..
Hey can you tell me where you buy your dark chocolate from? Can I also add butter instead of olive oil? And thanks for the sugar sub..orderin it right away 😃
Raw egg. 😬 I couldnt eat it.  Couldnt it be put in the oven and convert to souffle?
I don't know why oil seperates out when I start folding in the egg white. Could you please help with this?
I love key lime pie! That’s my favorite!😃Maybe you’ve done one already, I don’t know. I’ll look on your website.
Also, did I miss how many grams of chocolate & how much sugar you used?
Looks good. However, I would add the egg yolks into the warm chocolate before taking it off the heat to insure the bacteria gets killed.
Trifle please!
Tiramisu...
Peanut butter cups you know like recess I miss that!
It's a must to cook this great nigella Mousse! . 💓
What's with horns up? Lol hahaha
It’s funny how I start my day with you and end it with you , thanks sahil !
That looks Yummy, how about making us rhubarb & set custard with a peanut tuile, I know your imagination can tame that fool🤦‍♀️
Can you do Keto ice cream?
Green tea icecream is my favorite. :-)
Milk cake  Gulab Jamun Besan Burfi Ladoo
Gulab Jamun please
I made the mousse today. it came out pretty well. the texture and taste is out of the world.thank u again for this recipe.
cassonnade......is it keto.....???
Did you see highfalutin comparison of all sugars? He showed on his BS that Sukrin Gold spiked almost like castor sugar?? I’m not sure if peculiar to only his system and BS or if we all spike with Sukrin Gold. I’m contacting you to ask if you’ve see this occur with any others ? I hope it’s an anomaly vs Sukrin Gold not being an option to use . Because it sure is an excellent tasting product in recipes . His has been the only BS online test of all I’ve seen So wasn’t sure about if other data was out there or if you’ve heard different Thanks Sorry for my rambling 😂🤪getting late here 👍🏼
Buttermilk pie or chess pie.
Is the chocolate with sugar?
I think you just made my favorite dessert!
Master Chef Australia is the best one. All the others are not cooking shows as much as reality show bs.
Love me a New York Style cheese cake or a faux bread pudding using almond or coconut flour. Love your channel and enthusiasm mate. Cheers from Evesham, UK. :) <3
Red velvet cake with cream cheese frosting is my all time favorite desert.  I know this is an older video but if you can make it so will I. keep up the great videos \m/
YUMMY!  My favorite dessert in the whole wide world is Chocolate Ice Cream?  Could you make that keto?
Milk peda, Mysore Pak, Dokla, kaju Barfi......
That mousse looks utterly delicious, luscious, unctuous, etc, etc!  I’m afraid I’d eat the whole batch.  If you could whip up a Keto Tiramisu, you’d make my day. ❤️
You are so funny. I watch you everyday now. I love all your chocolate recipes.
Favorite desert....Japanese Fruit Pie. Wish it could be ketoized, but can't.
looks really good, like the dark rich chocolate; however, the eggs are uncooked, most advise to heat to 160 F to kill any bacteria. possibly mix the eggs into the melting chocolate and cook together, then pour and chill?
Hi Sahil, just clarifying because the video and the written recipe are different... Is it 50 grams chocolate or 75 grams chocolate? And I gather from the written recipe that it is 50 g of olive oil I think?  Thanks! Can't wait to try it once I pasteurize some eggs (I'm too much of a chicken to eat raw eggs from my county, lol)😂
Ur the only indian I understand!  lol awesome channel
German chocolate cake
Lemon pudding is my favourite.
My favorite desert is ......alll of them!  No seriously, I vote for almond croissant.
Your eggs look ultra healthy. Where did you get them from?
Rasmalai is my favourite
Sukrin gold is my go to
ty!
I don’t think it’s possible but pineapple upside down cake is my favorite
My favorite is Creme Brulee...I do love chocolate but a good brulee...mmm.
Do I need to use sukrin gold? Can I just use stevia?
Wow, this looks yummy and easy to make.  Fav dessert which I looking for a Keto version: creamy Kheer (without rice of course)
Interesting recipe
Love Masterchef! It finished here in Australia 3-4 months ago. I love hearing that it is watched an enjoyed overseas. I made this mousse for a dinner party and it was an absolute hit - you've inspired me to make it again 🤤
One of my favorites was cereal. Can you try creating a keto/low carb version of plain Cap'n Crunch cereal?
But the eggs are raw....is that okay?
Sticky date pudding or chocolate self saucing pudding... gluten free and Keto 😍
Just found this channel this guy is awesomeness and I love the way he talks 😂
Which song is it at the end before you start eating the mousse?
Great recipe. I will try this this week. I would like a Keto Lemon Meringue Pie please :-)
my favorite dessert is sweet potato pie or creme brulee.
By far my favorite dessert is Ice Cream. Since starting keto I've been craving it but none come close to the creamy Ice Cream we used to have. Flavor wise, my fave is Rocky Road or Mint Chocolate Chip. At this point any good Ice Cream, no matter the flavor, will do. I've tried making my own with heavy whipping cream (they don't sell Heavy Cream in my store) in an ice cream mixer but if just has a kind of waxy texture that I find in a lot of 'keto' friendly ice creams. I've experimented a bit but still haven't came up with a solution.
I miss creme brûlée and Leche flan.  But don’t know where to get unsweetened condensed milk.
Peanut butter chocolate ice cream.
Apple pie
something about listening to metal music in the background and watching chocolate melting
Haw many carb and sugar this delicios papy have...????????
Classic authentic Key Lime Pie 😉
What electric mixer do you use bro ? Anybody with good recommendations under 1200 bucks
Profiteroles !!
Panettone with Chocolate Chips made by Bauducco
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quindim - this one :D
I'm curious... doesn't it have an after taste of the olive oil?
Hi brother ....i can use brown suger ...stivea and sukrin not avilable in pakistan ...
Dude, you crack me up! I am curious about the new sweetener you used. Any aftertaste? Graininess? Love your work!
sweet potatoe pie .... well Thanksgiving  is coming soon
I have a niece that is allergic to dairy. This mousse is perfect for her!  Pfeffernusse cookies! My husband's favorite!  He's diabetic and we've been on keto for over a year.  I haven't been able to figure out a recipe for it do he can have them during the holidays.  I would be very grateful if you could figure out one...!😊💜
Oh my!  That looks delicious!  Favorite dessert?  Hmmmm.  It would have to be Lemon Supreme pie... https://www.villageinn.com/pies/lemon-supreme/
Badam Burfi
Keto carrot cake!
I like chocolate honey cake,  No sugar! Just sweetened with honey. It's got a very delicate taste.  Flower  Lots of Honey Cocoa powder Greek Yoghurt Eggs Salt Bicarbonate of soda Cream of tartare  You can make an iceing, which is  Cocoa powder Honey Greek yoghurt
This looks fantastic! Also: my one dessert of choice if I was stranded on a desert island would tiramisu. :)
German chocolate cake! Yum!
Hey can you make keto pudding? ive just been using sugar free pudding mix and carb free almond milk to substitute the milk. The only downside is its really hard to gauge what a serving size is once you make it. Any help?
Lovely! I'm going to try and make this today. I did try a similar recipe earlier (with butter I think). I added some lemon zest at the end for that added zing!
Rum raisin pumpkin bread pudding with caramel drizzle - Good luck with that one!
Chocolate chip cookie dough
This looks really good. Have you made a keto ice cream recipe without an ice cream maker?
Can you try to make Nigella’s clementine cake? That’s definitely Keto, need to sub for the sugar of course, but it’s delicious!
PLEASE MAKE KETO RAS MALAI  OR LADDOO. :P FOR FESTIVALS SPECIFICALLY.
I have just made this with avocado oil instead of olive oil and it is amazing. Just make sure you beat the egg yolks long enough to dissolve the sweetener.
I wonder if you could freeze it to get soft scoop ice cream?!
Deep fried alple-fritter doughnut bathed in creamy caramel sauce and topped with a tiny scoop of vanilla bean ice cream (no churn). Now THAT'LL be a challenge! For reference, Applebees has it on their dessert menu and O.M.G.! 🍩
just found your channel and im about to binge watch all your vids. Loving it so far.  As for a dessert I'd like to see. Can you make a chocolate keto bread pudding? I've tried many different methods to this, but im interested in your take on it.  Stay heavy!
can diabetic use it?
Please make pistachio ice cream. It’s the one thing I miss doing Keto.
Gotta find me some of that Sukrin Gold here in Oz.
Lol, I'm actually interested in the eggless version because I don't like tasting raw egg. I made an egg fast ice cream that used egg whites like that. It had a distinct, raw egg after taste. BLEH, disgusting.
Please can you make cheesecake?? That’s one thing I miss when I am on Keto 😔
Caramel sticky buns!
Hahahahaha STOP TYPING hahahaha :) can't wait to try this :) Favorite dessert...probably chocholate cake, but you already made that! Horns up!
You are just adorable.
My favorite is Brownie and ice cream.
Can you try a Tocino de Cielo? It’s similar to a flan, but better :)
My favorite desert in the whole wide world is rice milk mmmmm
I have all these ingredients!! I’m gonna make it this weekend. I don’t think an English accent will blurt out of me though. 😉
Baklava or French macarons, please!
My favorite desert is a lava cake.  I would love to have a keto version.
Thanks a ton for the eggless one
Banana pudding, please!
My favorite dessert :  " Tiramisu "
Extremely well done 💯
You really are quite accomplished, you know that? I enjoy watching you.
Obviously keto cheesecake is the best
That looks amazing!  I need to get some sukrin gold!
Oh my, that looks so decadent! Love Nigella and her recipes! I've got to get some dark chocolate when I go to the shops tomorrow! Yummy yum yum! 👏🖖✌🙂
Vanilla cake with coconut vanilla frosting
My favorite dessert of all time? Your biggest challenge of all time, sugar pie!
I've actually paired olive oil and chocolate before; they both exude an earthiness that complements each other. Btw, as always, I enjoyed the "jibber jabber."
O my gosh this seems georgeous!
Can you please do a video about fall pumpkin based recipes?
Creme Brûlée. :)
Looks yummy, I wonder if I could use avocado oil? Anyway fav pud has to be sticky toffee pudding with toffee sauce, can't remember the last time I had that 😛
Horns up 😘 Love your English accent 😂👍🏼 I love tiramisu if you can make a keto version I’d love you forever x
Favorite dessert: Peanut butter cookies with either peanut butter chips or chocolate chips.
Could you use ghee or butter? If so, what do you like better?
Creme Brûlée? BTW, I’m wondering how this mousse recipe would taste with something more neutral like avocado oil. Oh I almost forgot - RAS MALAI!!!
Try lakanto sweetner (http://a.co/d/ij0yP8C)  or even 1:30 mixture of  monk fruit powder and erythritol  (http://a.co/d/aIeagIB). Gets very close to taste of real sugar. It will not have weird taste of stevia and monk fruit is high concentrate sweetener
Not technically a dessert, but Pain au Chocolat!!! IMHO it totally counts 😍
maple bar donuts!
Rasmalai.
Can adding butter makes it better?!
Hahahaha you are so funny 😂 how can you separate two eggs?! They are already separated! 🤓
How did you know I was typing? haha
Ooh la la! Honey, hush. Southern bread pudding with whiskey custard. Dont even worry about it. It is my cheat. But this mousse looks good. What did you think of the sucrin gold? Did you choose that because it would work better for the recipe?
Hahaha! I'm watching this while eating my own version of keto chocolate mousse
Cookies. Lots of cookies
I’ve tried something similar with Avocado oil and another time with MCT oil. Both worked great and without any possible olive oil taste.
🤟🏼🤟🏼🤟🏼🤟🏼🤟🏼🤟🏼🤟🏼🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟🏾🤟🏾🤟🏾🤟🏾🤟🏾🤟🏾🤟🏾🤟🏾😍
Chocolate ice cream
The olive-oil in the dessert reminds me of an old recipe for a sweet cheesecake, which used feta-cheese.
Why would anyone be an eggless keto vegan why would anyone do that to themselves lol
Check the ingredients of the chocolate
Try the Keto frosty it's DELISH!!
I am watching this even though I am not so keen on chocolate 😂 you’re hilarious, man 👏🏻 it looked really good 👌
Bro you give me life!!!!!!!
Pavlova
Black forest gateau  Cream slice Custard slice  Dripping cake or lardy cake  Caramel slice  Jam tarts Jaffacakes  Victoria sponge Jammy dodgers biscuits,,,,,,yes these are biscuits but i miss eating a double pack and drowning them in milk until the last double come out of them in one sitting ;)
Well cool ,bet you cant make a apple and blackberry pie with pastry and custard followed by a apple crumble ;) good luck bro
Did you know. That the character Russell Brand is actually Nigella Lawson wearing a false beard.
Hi from Cyprus! English Trifle for the holidays please. Yum!
Yummo!! My goodness that looks amazing
Favorite dessert: Tiramisu (not sure how to get around the ladyfingers used in the traditional recipe).
Creme brulee,  tiramisu and coconut cream pie are my favorite desserts
Hey Brotherman, a really good low carb Tiramisu from you would be excellent.  I have seen one version, but it was not very appealing.  Really love your vids.
Do you use a light olive oil for this recipe? I'm with Allyson....creme brulee and pasteis de nata (a Portuguese pastry) are my faves!!
Cookie dough ice cream!!! 🧡💙  Would also love to see some bloopers. A fun video of recipes that didn’t work out or taste tests that were not so great tasting. ❤️
I watch all your videos, your channel is my number 1 keto channel on YT. Would you make a video on how to make home made heavy cream and home made whopped cream.
KETO ICE CREAM PLEASE!!!!!!! 🍦
I forget where Deepti (spelling) is.. Instagram?  Have either of you used ISOMALT in baking?  "Stop typing."  Loved that part. =D Kudos!
You’re missing the whip cream you got Ito have whip cream 😁 Looks amazing
My fave desert was the blackberry cobbler my grandmother used to make. Deeeelish!!
Cheesecake 😍😍 yummy yummy yummy❤️
🤣🤣🤣stop typing......😂😂
pavalova is my favourite dessert 🍨
My favorite dessert is tiramisu 😋
there is no way in hell you can make a keto version of Apple crumble and custard :( However you"ve got a better than average chance at Tiramisu :) So, I vote for that one!
Pecan pie!!!!!!!!!
Banoffee pie
Lemon meringue pie with a base of sweetened condensed milk, not gelatin.
I love music. Then I love chocolate. C ⚰️⚰️⚰️⚰️🥀🥀🥀
Thank you!
Sukrin gold is almost 7 k on Indian Amazon website. Anywhere else I can get it for a cheaper price?
Strawberry Sherry Trifle!
I'm a simple person: I see chocolate featured in a keto cooking channel and I start drooling instantly before I click the video!!!! Favourite dessert: Tiramisu (I cry every time I think of it, omg) and Baba de Camelo (Camel Drool), which is a traditional Portuguese dessert: basically, it's caramel mousse, very simple to make!
Haha 😂🥚🥚🥚
Lol - handles the eggless people and unwittingly unleashes the raw egg crowd. 😳 I’d make one twist to this and melt the sukrin in the chocolate as I find the keto sweeteners work better/smoother when melted. Yum - excited to try this, thank you. All time favourite dessert/pastry - creme brûlée / pasteis de nata.
Yum yum yum love it . Always the best ❤️❤️❤️❤️
My favorite dessert of all time is creme brûlée. I would love to see you do a Keto version. Thanks!
It's not cooked? Eggs are raw...
Creme brullee
Your videos are such a huge help. I love watching them.  They always give me great ideas for keto cooking.
Yum!! 😀🥑
My favorite desert is Sticky Toffee Pudding 😍
Golly gosh. I wish I had someone like you to cook for me everyday. Looks amazing! Love your channel 🤟🏽
How about a bla k forest gateau..Mmm.🤗
I love Surkrin Gold - it smells like brown sugar!
Very tasty and smooth, I like it, I will cooked it soon, I hope stevia is okay?
Which dark chocolate do you use?
So wait , the eggs aren’t cooked ?
I'm a new sub and I'm loving your channel. Good job man.
Woahhhhhh 💯😍👏🏼
