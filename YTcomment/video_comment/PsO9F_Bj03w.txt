I still love watching this video from time to time. Do you still have orchids?
My Orchid it’s stem was dark. Now it’s very light. Did I kill it.
Thank you..really appreciate and enjoyed this video...the best so far...simple and encouraging ❤
Thank you for this detailed presentation.
By the way I stayed away from orchids cause I thought they were so difficult to grow.But to my surprise thier not.Thier beautiful flowers
Thank you for your time I enjoyed your show and I learned alot about my orchids
You really shouldn't cut the yellowing leaves off they pull nutrients out of the leaf and if left they come off themselves with a sealed lead with no chance of infection .
Very informative!..,thank you very much! I was kind of getting dizzy already because there's so many informations out there that talks about it but really doesn't pin point exactly what you needed to do.., but you did in such a short amount of time!..I subscribed as I want to know more about it from you!..wish me luck!..lol...
Very informative
Great video I already repotted my orchid but the pot is way to big.  Now I feel like I should repot it again!
Did u make a kiki paste video?
YOUR VIDEO HAD THE MOST INFORMATION  OF MANY
very informative..thanks
Thanks, very helpful  & through.
You can just pick the media out of the ceramic pot and then add new media in it. It’s better than breaking the roots. Brad from brads greenhouse made a video about it.
I love the fact that you my new friend covered ,I think the most important basis of caring & growing orchids , beautiful job well done! I'm going to give it another go! Thank you Beautiful🤗🙏🏽
Excellent review!
Good comments thank you
Lady you are gorgeous! 😀❤️👍
Very thorough n helpful. Thanks for getting to the point rapidly!
A lot of places say use ice to water, but they are tropical and luke warm water is best .
You mentioned you use two different fertilizer, one for leaf and root growth and one for flower. When to use the higher nitrogen one (after blooming?) and when to use higher phosphorus one? Thank you.
best video I have  seen on growing and care ;well done   thank you
orchids are like children. they are to be beaten. with kindness, love, and affection. (;
Just bought a beautiful orchid today and I have to say this is the best video on how to care for an orchid very well done keep up the good work 👌😊
What do i do about the buds?
Great video. Very informative and I have a bunch of orchids. Happy planting ! Thanks for sharing !
Hi, Well your a lil' Orchid my dear - thanks so much, I'm recent to this Orchid challenge have researched and you add soooo much info in only 15 minutes thank you so much!! ALL my initial questions answered - update to follow. Too, you look so familiar, either a doppelganger or it is you, ran a night club in burbs of Chicago in previous life - highest grossing restaurant in the country, and spent years in San Fran part of the dot.com/bomb era - do we know each other - my first name Jay.
I'm new to orchids. I have found on one of my plants sticky droplets exuding from the bottom of the leaf.  Any insight to what this is an indication of?  Great lessons in orchids. Thank you.
Thanks
Is it a good idea to fertilize when the orchid is in bloom?  Enjoyed all the tips.  Some I had forgotten.
Thanks for this very informative video! I’ve been trying to care for one for the last 4 years. They keep dying. I’m feeling confident that with you directions, I’ll be able to successfully keep one alive for more than a few months.
Thank you for your very concise and informative video.
Adorei o vídeo parabéns!!!
Thank you , very helpful 🙏🏾
Wonderful video. Thanks. I'm new at growing orchids so still have many questions. Like:  Once the spike form a baby orchid, how do cut and/or pot that baby when it has 2 roots showing. Are these roots aerial?
soak your pots for 24 hours if the roots are coming out of the ceramic one made for orchids. Then you just sort of Wiggles of roots out orchids like to be able to get their routes outside the pot because that's how they grow. They are air Roots the other routes that are in the bar for the roots that would normally attach say Orchid to a tree and they would send out air routes. They like to breathe they don't like to be caught up inside a pot and when you put it in a decorative pot after putting it in a clear plastic pot do photosynthesis from any light shining in
keiki can grow itself the node is leave some nodes.
Your video is really comprehensive, Christine. Thank you.  May I ask, how come my orchids seem to have flower spikes with many blooms but usually those 2nd or 3rd blooms tend to turn pinkish and dry out?
hello what is the name of the mini beautiful white in a multitudes of dainty whites flowers?

Very interesting and informative. Thank you so much for this, I enjoyed watching.
you are brilliant and beautiful
Thank you very much Christine. This video is straight to the point and full of lots of useful information about growing and caring for orchids. I also like the format of your videos. Both sound and picture are clear and steady, a true pleasure to watch. You've got a new subscriber 😀👍🌸
I bought a tiny little purple phalaenopsis from my local grocery store, and it was on clearance. It's maybe...8 inches tall. It's adorable!   It's currently in bloom, but the flowers and buds look like they're shriveling up. :( I'm an avid gardener but this is the first time I've bought an orchid. All the research I've done still makes me insecure and I don't want to murder it via stress if I repot it too early. I've also looked up the potting mix but there are so many to choose from. Since it's just a baby, would you suggest I focus more on growth rather than bloom? That's what I'm thinking..
At the beginning..Why have camera on rack of clothes in backdrop..not the orchids. Seemed a bit distracting..sorry. But over all good useful info -Thank U for that!! Great camera great color..for doing videos on YT..😀 very good specific info for beginners 👏👏👏👏
you are so smart....just luv your vids....you make me look smart too.....my grandmother had an orchid farm in Trinidad W.I.....she taught me a lot but you know how it is you forget half of what your parents say
hello, how much did you pay for the beautiful white Phal, please?. Simply gorgeous!
Great video..... very very helpful....
This is an excellent video!  Very detailed and in depth.  You answered all of my questions.  Thank you🌻
I definitely have to say, you have the most information and well presented video on orchids that I have watched. Thank You!!  And I've been watching a number of videos. Thanks again!
Very informative. Thank you. I've been doing everything wrong caring for my orchid no wonder it's never rebloomed. I have no good place to put it and my cats won't stop trying to tip over the pot.😥
👍
Excellent video, 🌺
How do you manage to get your orchids that straight? Mine are always leaning to one side!
Thanks for awesome, beautiful get to the point and very informative video.  Your orchids are beautiful
LOVE your shirt
Hi Christine, I need help here. I recently purchased an orchid  and later on, noticed that there is a tiny hole in one the petal. 2 days later, I noticed that another petal had tear a little. Do you think this orchid is infested? And you know of any tricks, please help, ty.
I was given a full bloomed  orchid in a none hole dark plastic cup filled with sphagnum moss...should I repot it??
Fantastic and informative!
Like your sharing. Very useful information. Appreciated
Great and informative video...thank you. I bought an Orchid last year that only had 2 flowers on it and it was on clearance for $4... I hope it blooms again 🤞🏼 I'm trying to learn more about them so I can take better care of it.
Орхидеи
Why does my orchid then do all of this but smell like rotten eggs?
I think 3x a week is quite too much. You should let a little bit the roots silver as it they need. BTW your videos are amazing! Nice background and beautiful orchids. Continue uploading videos
Hi. Christine, if you please give me idea about planting and care of 'Oncidium Orchid' . Thanks 🙏 Zz.

My local Orchid Nursery retails to my local grocery store Home Depot and some flower and garden centres too
thank you , your video was helpful
Thank you for such an informative and easy to watch video on orchid care!
Thank you for this video it was very informative.
i got an orchid for mother's day. it is in bloom but it looks like it dropped all of it's unopened flower buds (3-4 of them). Should I do anything?
How do you stake a branch off of the main stem, which had a few buds in bloom at purchase in February?  In three months time we had 8 buds, 6 have bloomed  and 2 to go.  The added weight caused the branch to twist downward forming a crease.  What happens?  Can I help it to survive?  As you can tell a novice here.  Thank you in advance.
I've had my first 2 mini Phalaenopsis for a couple of months now. I used a lot of your suggestions and my white one is now in full bloom! Luckily in MN we've got an nationally known Orchid center (Orchids Limited), which helped me in repotting my babies.  Thanks for the vid, I also like the indoor cactus vid too!
can you make a playlist (plants) and put this vid in the playlist you don't make the playlist if you not like a make the playlist ???
Very informative Christine, well done and excellent graphics and chapter break clips too.  An orchid newbie, I now feel confident to get going.  On a video production issue, you might like to slow down a touch or perhaps insert a few pauses.  As in real life, people take breath, your jump cuts are sometimes a bit too hasty.  However having said that, your production standards are way better than most.  Well done.
awesome ur tut is so nice that it worked very useful for me expecting more n more videos from u .thank u soooo much.
Thank you very much you are most helpful ,now I know what I need to do before my orchid  dies on me .
My orchid just finished blooming and I did cut the branches back, one I did all the way the other half way. We are in March now and it's still chill and we are expected to get some more snow, yes I live in lovely Michigan. Do you recommend growing lites until we start getting some real good sun? Also it looks like my leaves are a bit wrinkly? Not sure why? Thanks for the help.
this is the best video.
Gorgeous flowers !!
Very helpful, thank you
You are a wealth of knowledge, Christine and I've been into succulents and orchids as well but I tend to kill mine ... glad I came across this video of yours as well as the succulent care one ... maybe I will be able to keep future ones alive ...
Thank you for your beautiful and informative video, I will give Orchids another try!
Excellent !  Thank you very much for great advice.
what does it mean if the leaves look a little wilty and droopy... does this mean it has a disease or can I revive it?
Surely all phals need to be in plastic pots with no opaque container? The roots need to see the light. That is what I have always read.
Great video pretty face.
great video! Thank you!
I am just so impressed with this videos. it was a "one stop shop" for me. I am new to caring for orchids and had a few concerns and you basically covered all what I needed to hear. I have one question though, the house I live is designed very "differently" and there aren't many Windows allowing shaded light in the house. what is the best recommendation that you can give me? I noticed the leaves are dropping and turning yellow
I think my orchid needs repotting 🌸
Best and most informative info I have found yet! Lovely orchids she has herself, very impressed!!
Hi Christine! I am taking care of my first orchid and just watched your video! Learned a lot :) However, still have a question. I was away on holidays and never had the chance to cut the stern before it started to rebloom. So now, what you said towards the end of the video actually happened. New spikes grew out of the tip of the old stern,  so now I have both a dead tip on the old stern and a bit under it a new spike starting to bloom. Would you be able to share with me if this has happened to you? Basically, my question is, should I cut of the dead tip of the stern and perhaps apply cinnamon so it prevents infecting the new stern? Would appreciate your help! Thanks!
I just bought an orchid last night and watered it. Should I repot it still since I cannot see the roots and when do I know when to repot?
My grandpa loved his Phalaenopsis.
Hot Caucasian female talking about Phalaenopsis Orchidacae. Any time you have my attention. Time to hit the garden store for a different species ... one that grows pseudopods. Ummmm, yummy.
I have searched and searched for clear instructions for my first two orchids. This is the first I have come across that I can understand and use. Thank you very much. It's also the first blog I've used (I'm old!)
Is there a initial bloom every year? Should i prune leafs? I've notice it starting to look like it haves a stalk stacking leafs on top of each other
I 'm in awe! Your Orchids look amazing 😍
Your video was very helpful thank you for sharing. after watching other videos I didn't realize I needed to wipe the stem with peroxide after being cut. my question is will the it get sick from not doing this step?
Nice 😀👍
This video answered everything that I needed to know. Thank you!~
hey aweosme video was sooo helpful! but I still have questions on fertilizers.   so my phal orchid is in full bloom. healthy leaves and roots still in moss but I'll chance that to bark once the flowers drop in a month are so.  I was wondering if you could recommend me a fertilizer to use. a brand. i was thinking of sticking to 20-20-20 all around is that okay?  also do you stop fertilizing once it blooms? or do you always fertilize. i have heard you do once the blooms drop so I am confused as to when I fertilize and when I stop if I do at all. and you would do it once a week correct? also is miracle grow bark media okay to use? thank you in advance!
That was an eye opener :) Thanks so much! ♥ No wonder my previous orchids all had died, poor things. I did like every single thing wrong :))) I put them in ceramic pots, covered them in peat moss and even some pebbles on top, watered them a lot and put them on the window. Oh dear.... :)))
good video ! very helpful
I absolutely loved this video. It was full of all the information that I need in order to take care of my new orchid. Thank you
Excellent video. You have provided a wealth of information for us orchid newbies. Thank you very much!
Excellent video on Phal care
Wow thank you for filming this video. Very thorough and informative. I have my orchids in the bathroom. Should I keep them there? Also where do you buy the clear containers?? I need some and don't know where to buy them.
thanks 4 talking SO FAST ! .. somehow it helps keep my full attention. I learned alot from this vid. I am a "new-bie" 2 orchids.
THE MOST comprehensive short video on caring for orchids. So, basically orchids are like sensitive spoilt demanding babies.
buenas noches me gusta ver sus videos aunq no entiendo su idioma como me gustaria q pucieran subtitulos en español
Very informative.  Thank you so much!
Best orchid care video I've every seen!
Love, love,love orchids started a small collection last year. The information on this video is great!!! Thanks so much
Omg, I'm your advice on watering is Way OFF the mark. I've only been doing this for a year or two, but Everything I've read and watched says to water once every 7-10 days. You let the water run thru the pot, completely drain, never let it stand in water, and then put it back in its decorative pot. I'm not trying to be rude, but I've never heard Anyone say this about watering Phalaenopsis orchids.....if I did that to mine they would rot. And I live in the desert!?
If I cut and allow it to focus on the green growth will it grow again and bloom?
love your video... I hope my orchids grow as beautiful as yours... wish me luck on my third orchid...
I'm just starting with orchids, although I have admired them for years, and found this super helpful. Thank you!
hi just got my first phalaenopsis as a gilf I think this one came from a food llon ? have trouble finding   your kine of food and bland. some of the roots look light green and some look like thay are starting to turn alight yellow should I replanted  and look a then out of the pot ?  thanks Rose Marie
Awesome video
Thank you so much for this video! I have been very tempted to buy an orchid but was so worried about killing it!
So helpful and lots of information. Thank you.
I live in Toronto, Canada... Its cold in the winter but hot in the summer... I bought my orchid from just add ice orchids and they say to put 3 ice cubes/week and thats it.... Is that ok?
Very good and complete information for beginners
Thank you so much for all the extended information. Very hopeful!
Fantastic video!
My absolute favorite orchid video - Very comprehensive.  Thank you for mentioning the part about roots attaching to ceramic holey-pots.  Such good information and I've not seen another video that discusses this. (yet... ;)  ) Also, the ice cube part; I've always known to water any house plant with room temp water, never chilly water so I am glad to hear you warn about not using ice cubes on a tropical baby.  Your orchids are absolutely lovely and you are an inspiration.  You've convinced me to do some succulent dishes now!  Off to the nursery!  New addiction! Thank you for putting yourself out there.  Very brave and appreciated.
Thanks for uploading this video! Finally, some useful info about orchids ....
very helpfull
where did you buy Rubbing Alcohol!!
can you do a video about succulent plant care?
This is absolutely the best video for orchid grower novice!
Thanks for the video I have learned a lot also.  I have had my orchid in the same pot for about 5 years, and have often thought about repotting, but never knew how.  It keeps blooming year after year, and I'm really surprised it's still alive., especially after seeing this. Idea.  It's sitting next to my stove, and has had oil splatter on it, it's near a cold window, in a dark pot, but it still hangs on.  I'm going to repot after this bloom cycle is over.
This is like caring for a child...I may have bitten off more than I could chew when I bought my orchid :-). Awesome vid! Thanks!
This is so helpful! Thanks. Love from Malaysia :)
Your Phals are stunning and I like the colors you picked!
Great topic , learned a lot !! 🌸🌺🌸
Great Video!
Thank you for this very helpful video!  You answered all of questions except one that I am confused about because I am new at orchid growing.  You say to cut the flower spike all the way down when it is finished blooming.  Where does the new flower spike grow up from?  Does it grow from the old one that was cut down or does a new one emerge from somewhere else?  I have cut back a couple orchids but nothing has happened for months.  The one I didn't cut all the way back, but cut a few inches higher up at stem node, bloomed again quickly from the same stem.
Very informative! Thank you very much. Mom got an orchid from her friends in September for her birthday, we didn't know much about orchids, and ofc it didn't go too well. Many flowers died before they even bloom! Now it's time to relaunch it with full of care and your video is a perfect guide!
wish i saw this video a month ago! my orchid is dying ):
where to buy keiki power pro or keiki past
great informative tutorial, thank you
thanks for the helpful advice,,
Thank you for this helpful, informative video! I just love your channel. It's so inspiring.
Glad I found your video. Very informative.
great video im just  starting ive two lovely orchids love them
Great video. Hard to find all the basics in one video, but this one does. Even worth the WalMart plug. Thanks!
My daughter gave me a beautiful orchid on Mother's Day.  I am a African Violet person and never thought I would care  for doing  orchids.  Well this beauty is still blooming!!  so I thought why not try and keep it going - have watched a number of videos but I must say yours was the best.  I had basically ignored this orchid for all these months but have now decided it really needs to be taken care of.  I mean, how can you discard a flower that blooms for 5 months with little to no care.
i'm just starting and you are SO helpful. and the condition of your plants overcomes any doubt about your knowledge. thanks.
Great explanation thanks for your time😘😀👍🏻
Awesome video, so informative.  I would love to see how to try to get a baby one a little later, once I get this down.  Never kept orchid alive before, now I know why.
Help my Orchid leaves are turning brown  idk what to do :(
Exactly the information I was looking for, neatly summed up. Thank you for the lovely video.
Wow..one of the most thorough video on orchid care for beginners. Thx gorgeous! xx
thanks!
I think I got the mini orchid as it was dying.   Two stems dried out and at least three large leaves dried up.  What do I do?
THEORCHIDX
Watering with ice cubes will make the plant to produce a spike. Ice cubes are like the cool temperatures in the fall.
Amazing info.  Thank you!
This is probably the most concise, yet basic informational video for growing & caring for orchids. I will be sharing this with my friends who gave up on orchids in the past.
best 15 minutes I spent all day!  Thank you for the tips!
Great video!
can you do a video with the keiki paste?!
Thank you! Very helpful, and your presentation is nicely structured. We watched 5 other You Tube videos, and your post was by far the most thorough, and easy to understand. Thanks again for a helpful video.
This is a great and informative video. Thank you!
I have a bit of a dilemma, and if anyone could help me out, thatd be awesome. ^-^'  I recently had a huge white Phal orchid that I'd purchased at Ott's Garden Center. The blooms were nearly as large as my hand (blooms roughly 4.5"-5" in diameter and about 6-8 leaves around 10" long). It had two spikes that were loaded with blooms. Unfortunately, while I was on vacation, the second caretaker (nobody was home for two weeks-- we had a different person care for it on the second of the two weeks) must have forgotten to water it (it was in sphagnum moss as well, but I was waiting to repot until blooming finished). That, combined with a mealy bug infestation, ended up being the death of the poor plant.  Now I'm on the search for another Phal that size, but all I can find (both online and in garden centers) are the standard little 3" blooms. ): I'm not sure if this was a special species of Phal, or a hybrid of sorts, or just an older plant. If anybody knows where I might be able to find another one of these, that'd be great. It was gorgeous, and I'm really hoping that I might be able to find another one of these.
I found this video back in April. You made it sound so simple to care for Orchids...you are right!  I bought my very first one at the end of April  and have since then bought 8 more. They are gorgeous :)  I have used every one of your tips/advice. Thank you so very much!
The roots are in a ball covered
I just purchased a phal that was put in a ball shape with I don't know what kind of media, wrapped with sheet moss then secured with fine fishing  nylon thread. It's in full bloom so I'm going to watch it but I don't think that Pals like to have their roots bound like this. He said that it was a bonsai.
Hi! This is the most comprehensive and understandable video on these types of orchids I've found! I went out and bought the two types of fertilizer you recommended. I'm a little confused which ones to use. I've had one phal orchid for 6 months now, it's been done blooming for a couple months so I cut the spike. Which fertilizer should I use to promote reblooming? I also have one that's in bloom right now.
Thanks, Christine! That was very helpful. I'm nervous about repotting my orchid (my husband was the orchid grower), but after seeing this, I feel more confident. Mahalo nui!
This video was extremely helpful! You really broke it down. Thank so much!
Seems  like a lot of time...... one might be ok
Wow! Very informative!!
please do more videos like this!!!
Thanks soo much for this video!!! I just started with the Phalaenopsis Orchid....Where did you find the white pots for them? Also I love all your videos
Wow excellent explanation, very helpful I have two of these orchid plants and wanted to learn how to care for them. This will definitely help. Thank you, I liked and subscribed. :)
This is by far the BEST video for information. Thank you
I just got a new orchid, i got it in full bloom with some buds, but its planted in moss in a small glass jar. Do i need to repot it?
Christine Kobzeff I'm a new subscriber :) I came about your channel thru this video, i love orchids! Do you live in Hawaii? I've never seen orchids as healthy as yours, even the short Wal-Mart clip's orchids are healthy. I've heard that Hawaii is perfect weather for orchids, i have over 30+ orchids, different varieties but not one is as healthy as yours :( what is the typical environment in your home? Like is there alot of humidity? Temperature? Take care and good luck on all your future endeavors!
I am having some issues with little tiny flies around my orchids. i think maybe my pots aren't draining fast enough and the damp media is a breeding ground for these little pests. I have already drilled extra holes in my containers, but do you have any suggestions on how to get rid of them?
I find the cheapest ones from the swamp meet tend to die and are damaged, we'll at least at the  swamp meet that I go, anyways I love your orchids there so beautiful
Hey dear Christine! I watched alot but yours was super beautiful and super helpful xoxo
Please do more flower videos! :)
Thank you for this video. It's very helpful.
Thank you so much for this video. I bought an orchid about 3 weeks ago. I'm a little less intimidated by them now.
Hi, great video! Could you please do one about growing and caring for aloe vera plants? Greetings from Holland!!
You are adorable. Love your videos. Thanks and please make more and more.
wow good job! great explanations!
My mother in-law just received one for her Bday from a lady that owned a Orchid farm and told her to soak in for about an hr when watering them.
Where can i find plastic see through flower pots!?! Ive bin to home depot lowes and Walmart can find them anywhere x)
I was so excited to watch this video. My orchid was in need of some TLC and now I know how to help it.
Where can i buy the clear plastic potters you have for the orchid? I checked orchard, lowes and home depot. They didn't have any unfortunately.
Thank you so much for this video, Christine!! You explain everything so well and now it all makes sense to me.  I went ahead and purchased a few orchids!  Love taking care of them following your video!  Thank you!
I love orchids and have read a lot of them and I have to say this video was super helpful ! I notices my orchids have a hard time reblooming so had to give this fertilizer a shot :) I wanted to know what would be your advice for an orchid with rotten roots ? Any chance to save it ? I love your channel, can't stop watching,  everything about you is interesting ;)
Fantastic video! Incredibly useful and informative.. I can't wait to start my journey with these beautiful orchids. Thank you for removing all the obstacles and you answered all my concerns and questions that I've always had regarding orchids.
If i buy a phal orquid planted in spaghnum moss , should i transfer it to bark?
Best orchid care video out!!
Dear Christine, thank you so much for the immensely informative video tour. You managed to answer all of my questions about orchids simply and thoroughly. Thanks so much for sharing your experiences and knowledge so generously. You're amazing...
I believe my orchid has root rot. Is there any way to save it?
Okay this may be a dumb question, when it comes to fertilizing do you buy two diff bags of fertilizer and mix them together or use them separate or just one bag with the highest fort and second number?!
Thank you for doing this video it is very informational. I love orchids but they always die now I know how to help them and keep them alive better!
You are a wealth of knowledge!  Wish I had these tips when my orchids kept dying a few months ago.  The woman at the store said to just water them once a month because they don't like water!  Apparently in my climate it should've been once a week,
I just got an orchid for my birthday! Perfect video - really interesting plant - am looking forward to caring for it. Thanks for the helpful information!
Wow!!
Thank you this video has been super helpful!
hi can you repot a Phalaenopsis Orchids in a metal pot
......my orchid would die without you.
Hmm.. Just a little confused.. you said you dont want the mix to retain too much moisture because the orchid likes to breathe and not suffocate..but then after you said they like lots of water and to really drench the bark when you re-pot because new bark doesnt hold as much moisture as old bark :/
Thank you so much for this video! Love all the info, i would love to see the baby orchid video, please?
Hello Christine, Firstly, I've noticed (a little while ago) you're not under pinksofoxy anymore, so, Hi, it's nice to know your name. I've also noticed that you show a great deal of thought, consideration, nurturing, care,  application and attention to detail in what you do, It would lead me to another question that is absolutely none of my business. However, you appear to be a very natural, down to earth person.  Having said that, I wish you the very best and truly hope that you receive your hearts desire.
thumbs up thumbs up thumbs up. so lovely, christine! x
Wow, that was so helpful and informative!  I feel much more prepared now. Our wonder I had issues before - so much I did not know. Thank you!
Thank you for your detail advise. Motivated by the way you took tender care over your Orchids. Happy gardening ;)
Now I want an Orchid. :) A great job on the video. Your Orchids are beautiful.
I have a bunch of phals so I like watching this video, but it's so funny, you explain everything so well but both times you poured water in the orchids, you never see you dump it back out!  Eeeek!
thanks  i love orchids but i always hear is so difficult  to care for. thank you again yesterday i purchase my first orchid crossing my finger. need to go to home depot to purchase the rest  xoxo marlene from NYC
I use only sphagnum moss for my Phal orchids, so I would say it depends largely on your environment as to whether or not sphagnum is good for your orchid. Very thorough video!
subtitle in spanish please!!
Great video! So helpful
This was excellent...I love orchids but have always stayed away from them...I will be purchasing my first very soon...Hopefully all your tips will help me to have a gorgeous assortment of orchids...This was very informative....
Thank you so much for this video. I have learn so much!!! Can't wait to put all this to work! Thank you!
OMG....I am so glad I'm a new subbie....this has been the best care of orchid video I have seen to date.....I have 5 orchids and you have given me some more great tips...I had one orchid getting ready to shoot a budding spike and I broke it ..........TEARS!!!!! I really cried:( but a lesson learned.....Great video....TFS:)

in nature orchids grow in trees, so why do you put them in small plastic pots?
I just love your videos!
Thank you Christine.  I learned more from this video than reading online for the last several months!  Now I feel I'm good to go to purchase my first orchid!  :)
this is such an amazing video thank you so much! please could you do a video on how to care for cactus' and succulents? xxxx
subscribing, you're sooooo amazing and i had so much pleasure to listen to you till the end, thx for the information=)
Are they safe for cats?
Can an orchid be drown with too much water?
Thank you so much for sharing all you're wonderful talents.....many blessings from CA
Very helpful and easy to understand video thank you
Christine, my orchids came in clear plastic pots. Do I need to take them out and drill holes in these? Or is it ok to leave them as is?
More video please!!!!
When you going to do your DIY video again? I miss it already ☺️☺️☺️ 😍
Hey everyone go check out my new YouTube just click my user name and check on my intro video I will make more upcoming videos if you request them don't forget to like all my videos and please subscribe to my channel thank you
Yes let's have a Keiki!!
Loved this video. I just purchased a phalaenopsis and found conflicting opinions.  Thanks, Kristine.
Thank you for this. Learned a lot!! Orchids are so fragile and need lots of care. Unfortunately, I haven't been so good to my orchids in the past. : ( I hope that can change after this info.
I really, tuly enjoyed you video!   I love the detail and thorough description of the care you take in caring for your orchids.   I have had the worst luck growing them but am now confident and excited to apply your techniques.  I will do the same for other bromeliads, they are so beautiful and make me so happy!  Luv you, thank you!  You're awesome!
Great Vid! I need all this info! I am good at keeping my orchids alive, but I can never get them to flower again. Any specific advice for that problem? Meanwhile, I'm off to water my orchids......
What a fantastic video. Thank you Christine. I now have hope because... I was doing it ALL wrong . Cheers to you . My current still alive orchids, the new ones  I will purchace & my husband Thank  You! (( as do I))  Lol. ! Would luv to see the "K paste" video .
Thank you so much for posting this, just a quick question, where do you purchase your white ceramic flower pots with Christine Kobzeff
This was so helpful.  Thanks.  How about a garden video?  It will help me survive what's left of this miserably cold winter;)  Counting down the weeks 'til my daughter's Maui wedding.
This is a great video, very helpful. Thanks! I hope my orchids get better soon.
Awesome video! I so needed that-no wonder I was killing my orchids! Thanks for the help :) I was wondering if you could do a video on your current skincare routine and what natural oils and products you are using?  I would looooooove that, it's been a while and knowing you I bet it's changed ;) Also, I'd love to see you make like "what we ate this week" videos so we can get some healthy new ideas! It would be cool to know more about your jewellery business (like how many swap meets you go to, how many hours do you spend a week making jewellery, tips for crafters wanting to venture into the swap meet/farmers market business etc.) I know that's a lot, sorry! I just love you, your videos, your lifestyle-you inspire me so much to go after my dreams of crafting and living a simpler, decluttered, healthier more satisfying life! XO
Love your videos.  My question is when you be able to do another diy body scrub
Thanks for such a detailed video. I just got a mini orchid and I want to work my way up to a bigger size. I'm saving this video for future reference! :)
I love Orchid, warm regards :)
Thanks so much for this, because of you I have been thinking of buying an orchid (which I adore) and have been looking for some information on how to take care of them properly. :D thanks love your videos
I love the instrumental song you played in this video and in a couple of your videos who plays it???
Chris,  very, very well done.  Looking forward to more video's.
Thank you for doing this video.  My orchid was a gift 10 months ago.  I needed to care for the roots and repot.  Now I have done this I will be watching for new roots to start.  More videos and how to encourage a baby orchid (kewi). Thank you again
Thank you for the video, it's very helpful! Love from France
beautiful orchids, thanks so much for the great video
i don't rhink there's one video from you i don't like :)
Where can we buy your jewellery from?
very informative and very helpful! Thanks!!!
wow, so much great information here - thanks for taking the time to share this video!
Orchids  are my absolute  favorite  flower. I never brought  any real ones  because  I don't  know  how  to  care  for  them. Thank  you for this detailed  information  video.
Classy move with the new name!
Why did u change ur user name Christine?
Thanks for all the information it definitely helps. Your also so great at making video short and full of infor. Your awesome.
You should totally do a video on the keiki paste
Love this video. So informative!!
Thank you so much for this video! I've always wanted orchids but never knew how to care for them properly. Already found a local orchid nursery and will visit next weekend. :) Just curious, where do you buy your plastic containers for your orchids? My usual nursery doesn't carry orchid pots and the orchid pots online seem too expensive when I could just buy a normal plastic container and then drill the holes myself. Thanks!
Thank you so much for this video! I've always loved orchids but was afraid of them as I'm not the best gardener and heard they were very particular. My husband gave me a beautiful orchid for valentines day and I was worried I'd kill it. Your video was perfect timing for me! So much great info!
Yay! Thanks for this. Glad you made this before I went out and purchased one.
I'm new to your channel, and I'm sooo impressed with this video, the most clear and educative I've ever seen!! Thanks!
Thank you so much for doing this video! I have been thinking about getting an orchid but had no idea where to start. This was perfect! Very informative!
Very helpful Tips! Thank you for the insight, can't wait to step up my Orchid growing game! 🌸
Great video. Orchids have always scared me- I guess because I worked in a flower shop as a teenager and I know how much the blossoms cost!  My mother-in-law grows them but I don't think she cares for them- I think she buys new ones. It is a lot of information but It was well presented and it is important you know what you will be getting into before you buy one .
oh, i loved this video. thank you for posting it.
This was really helpful, thank you.
Thanks so much for this video. I've been dying to buy some but afraid I'll kill them and this helps a ton! xox
Wow...this is so informative! I love orchids, but I've never had one. Now I'm thinking I can pick one out, get the proper accessories and give it a try, thanks to you. Yours are all gorgeous and happy-looking; I especially love the one that looks like it's the colors of a sunset. ♥
Thank you Christine from France to Help me how take care my orchids!! Have a nice sunday
Super helpful video! I feel a bit ashamed now that I've never thought about sterilizing when cutting and so on... I grew up with a mom who loved orchids, so it kind of rubbed off on me too. I like the fact that they can live up to 4 weeks without water lol But I live in a colder climate, and it's never hurt them. I do water them a bit different than you, I make up a bathtub and shower them. Something I didn't feel come off in your video (maybe it's just me?) is that you didn't really imply to pour out the water once they've soaked. Anyway, about not letting water getting into the crown I've completely missed, but yet again, never had a problem with that. I've actually done so with purpose when showering them, because thinking of their natural habitat, when raining, there would be some droplets in the crown and shouldn't disturb.  I'm a bit on the fence about fertilizing my plants. I'm not experienced and have questions like, how do I know it's natural? And not some chemical substance that's not good rinsing out into nature? (Like we humans use non-natural shampoo) Maybe it's a stupid thought, but I'd like to know. So far my orchids rebloomed well on their own. But I never thought about re-potting. Thank you for this video, looking forward to the next one :)
Christine, you have such beautiful Orchids!!!!. Thanks for the care tip's!!. Texas Lady :)
Now I must go get a orchid tomorrow. Thanks for the tips
Christine..I have 2 orchids and I had no idea to take care of them..so I thank you for teaching me so much..This is a great video..I am sure I will refer to it a few times..xoxox Loretta
Wow ..i am doing everything wrong for my Orchids hence no flowers...haha, Thank you so  much for this great info and video, really appreciated :)
Thank you!! I have some pot bound orchids and never knew how to re- pot. Please do a keike video!!
Thank you for this.  Every time I see Orchids I pick them up and put them down, and then pick them up again and carry it around before ultimately deciding against buying.  Now it doesn't seem so scary.   After you cut the spike will it eventually sprout a new one?  Is it like an Amarylis where it will grow again the following year?
I feel inspired to go buy an orchid now. Great video.
TY!  I find orchids to be incredibly beautiful, but haven't bought one b/c I don't have a green thumb at all!!!  Your video makes the whole task seem less daunting.  Maybe someday, I'll have the courage to buy a gorgeous one, and take good care of it! :D
I am seriously so jealous.   Is there anything you can't do ?    I truly love everyone of your videos.  No matter what the subject is.   You always make everything look so easy.   And your taste is very classy and elegant.   I wish I was half as creative as you.   I look forward to all your videos.   Thank you so much.   You brighten my day.🌷
Where do you find the clear pots?  I can't seem to find any locally and was wondering if it is something I'll probably have to buy online...
Can you do more flower videos? I also love your nail videos(:
Thanks for the info.  I have 3 orchids which were gifts and had no clue how to care for them.  I'm repotting them right now and I'm shocked at the materials they were potted in.  They were stuffed super tight with moss and now the roots are all moldy.  Hopefully I can nurse them back to health with a proper potting mix. Thanks again!
Make more DIY plz
I enjoyed this video wayyyy more than I thought I would. The love, care and concern you show your orchids is beautiful, just like a mother and her baby ♥
Thank you so much excellent video so informative!!
Great video! Really helpful. I followed your advice and repoted mine today. I cut the stick quite a while ago and wonder if a new one will grow and where it will come from?
Very helpful video!! I love orchids!! :)
So helpful video! U should do another one as u said with this strange cream😉
Thank you so much for this video, I loved it !!
Thank you so much for this video. I am trying to keep an orchid alive, quite unsuccessfully I might add, and now I know what I am doing wrong. I hope that my second orchid will have a better fate.
I think you would cry if you saw the state of my orchid at the moment. Glad I saw your video, help is on the way! ;).
Thank you for this video!  I've ruined every orchid I've ever tried to grow.  I've learned so much from this video and hopefully will have better luck in the future.
Great video! Very informative! Thank you for all the info! I adore orchids and I really wanna get better at taking care of them!;)
I love the extensive details that you share with every video you make.. Thank you for your continuous excellence.. You are inspiring and I don't mind telling people that I look forward to every video from you.. .
Thank you for this. My husband got me an orchid for Valentine's day & it's already lost it's blooms, so hopefully I'm going to be able to bring it back with your tips
I like how you are using your true name now. Good to see you! :)
This was an excellent tutorial!
I loved this!  Always wanted to try my hand at orchids and you have given me the tools needed.  Well presented, always look forward to seeing you and hanging out.  Looking good!  Keep the videos coming; garden, take us to work, health and beauty, a day in the life.......  Thanks for being you!   PS. Loving my jewelry, wearing some greenish metal filigree earrings as we speak.  God bless you and Michael
Orchids, roses and ranunculus are my favorite flowers. It's so amazing to appreciate the many different forms of life in our planet and through gardening, somehow be a part of it :)
Oh girl, i really happy seeing you made this video. I am an orchid grower. You should try some species. ;))
Thanks for all the information. Your videos (generally) are really helpful. I just want to ask a little question. There are lots of roots outside the pot at one of my orchids. Now it is blooming. After the blooming period I am planning to change the pot. However, I cannot decide. Should I use the same  pot, or should I use a bigger one so that I can put the outside root to inside?
Fabulously helpful, thank you so much. I've just started working at a new place & there is a very poorly orchid there - I don't know the name/variety of it & it is sitting on top of pebbles over water in a pot. Its air roots are silvery & wrinkled, its leaves are weak & wrinkled too & it has two flower spikes with unopened buds. I'd love to nourish it but I'm nervous of doing the wrong thing, any suggestions please? Thank you.
I have been wanting to get into plants for a while now and after watching this I definitely want to try orchids. They're so lovely and seem to be easy enough to care for. :) Thanks for the tips!
How to transfer baby's from the Mama orchid to a pot? I have 3 of them and don't know how to do it ;)
hi Christine, thanks a lot for this video ! I have learned a lot ! please can you do another one showing how you repot them step by step ? xo from France
I absolutely love this video, thank you for taking the time to make this one. I have always been intimidated by orchids. My grandma used to grow them in Kalihi and now that I'm in OR this would be a great way to remember her 😊
Awesome, thank you!
Great video! I've learnt so much from it. Thanks for sharing, I'm for sure gonna try the tips you gave us.Thanks again.
Thank you so much for this video! My husband bought e an orchid for Valentines Day and I had no idea how to care for it other than just water it. You probably saved it life lol!
This has nothing to do with orchids but I just had to tell you that I totally overheard my husband and his friend trying to tie a tie following your old video last weeekend. It was so adorable and I was like hey I watch her!! LOL
Thank you so much I was need it !!! I have 3 orchids at home now, and one of them finished blooming and leaves fall off also, I repotted it the roots wasn't well I clean it a bit, but not like in your video, should I do it again ? Another question, another plant almost done blooming but leaves already fall off and I noticed that roots is not doing so well should I wait to repot it till blooming done ?
Thank you for making this video!  Please do another orchid video about the baby orchid!
Its very Nice thanks for this good video
Wow very awesome video. I always love orchids but I was so scared of killing the plants! Now thanks to you I will learn to take care my orchid I got for my birthday and hopefully getting more plants for my new house!
I learned so much from this video!
Thank you, Christine, for such an informative and interesting video. I was just thinking to get some orchid flowers to my room, but wasn't sure mostly about all the caring routine! Now it looks not that difficult :) Waiting for more flowers and plants vidios :)
Your a life saver my mom had just bought an orchid and she's really into plants but she's never had an orchid I will for sure tell her these tips <3 your the best
Great timing .. just got an Orchid for Valentine's Day ... never had one before so this video gave me some great information. Cheers!
Thanks so very much😊
You're so talented! I might ask for an orchid for my birthday :)
These are BEAUTIFUL, i am getting in to gardening! Please post more vids like these Christine x
Is better to flame the scissors instead of using alcohol ( in order to desinfect them ), or if you use alcohol leave it more time to stay on the scissors because in order to kill the germs, the alcohol needs a few minutes : ) I have to say, this is an amazing video. I am not that much into orchids , but after watching this video I don't think anymore that is that hard to take care of them so I might give one a try soon : )
GREAT Video!! Thank you so much Christine! I'm definitely going to buy an orchid now by following all of these tips and hopefully i will succeed by keeping it alive. Ha ha We are moving next weekend so I get one or two to decorate.
After you cut off the stem will another one grow where the old one was?
Very helpful and interesting, thank you! I may try growing orchids!
Love the video! Tks for all the useful informations
Thanks so much for this informative video!
That is so interesting, Christine! I enjoyed watching this video. I learned alot. I've never had an orchid but always loved looking at them in the store. Thanks again and take care. Jennifer
Thank you so much for this video it was so helpful.  I will by my first orchid.
Greatttttt!!! Thanks
This video was so helpful. Thank you!
Thank you for the very informative video!!!
Thank you soooo much for this video!
Whats your instagram?
Thanx for the information.  I have always wanted one of these beautiful plants, but have never met anyone who was able to get a rebloom.  Thanks for the training I may try it now.  How long does it typically take to get another flower spike?
Thank you so much!! I have a ton and learned a lot.
I am grateful for this video.  I have had orchids for many years and all I ever did was water them but seeing that I can transplant and fertilze them wow they can be so much more! Yours look stunning.
thanks love orchids!
This is such a valuable video for me.  I have an orchid now and have no idea how to care for it.  Thanks so much!
Really helpful information and growing tips for these beautiful plants. Always wanted to know how to take good care of phalaenopsis orchids, thanks for sharing.
Perhaps you could do a video on how to get your orchids to re-bloom the next year.  That can be a challenge!
I had an orchid before it died after the first bloom. But I had no idea how to take care of it. Now that I've seen this I've fallen in love. It's really an art in taking care of them. I'm going to go out and get myself one 😀😃
Christine thanks so much for the video!!! It's exactly what I needed. I haven't been able to find clear advise about Orchids anywhere else! I look forward to more videos about Orchids from you! Thanks for sharing xx
Is it ok to keep them in fairly cold air?? (I have a wintergarten, nice & warm in the day but cold-ish at night...)
As usual you are so articulate, concise and super informative.   I have never had much success with orchids..but I am now going to have another try!  Thank you x
hello please check out my youtube channel
Great video for those just starting out with orchids.  I would stress that for most people (i.e. not in a tropical climate) watering every 7-10 days is enough.  The roots need to dry out in between waterings.  Only water when the roots turn a silvery green color.  Of course you can always mist the aerial roots and top media throughout the week.  -New York hobbyist
Thanks Christine for all the Information!! This was really helpful. My orchids will benefit a lot from me seeing this!!
Thank you Christna, this is perfect timing as mine need repotting and now you've shown me how.  Excellent video!  XIsi
OMG Christine ,thank you for this video!! I have so many of this Orchids in my home i just love them.....every year they come back and bloom so beautifully, I have them for years now.....but i never re pot them only water them and cut them after bloom....i was told to never water them from the top so i always put all the pots in a container with water and they sucked the water for about 10m and then i put them back on place.....I have learn a lot now....thank you !
I have an orchid from 1 year now and I still didn't know some of the tips you showed. Thanks for the video!
Do you have any Dendrobian Speciosum?  Not quite as pretty as a Phalaenopsis, but vastly more robust.  Put one anywhere in your garden and it will prosper.
I watched this entire video and I don't even plan on having orchids. I just really like how you explain things (is that weird?) hahaha
Thanks! This video was very informative! :)
I just found you and dont know how i was living without you your voice is so calming and i just had to subscribe
Omg this video was awesome you have so much knowledge about plants!! I want to grow a garden this summer (flower and a food garden) so it would be awesome if you could make a gardening series! I had no idea so much went into it
How long does it take for the spike to regrow after its been cut?
Hello!i’m sorry but I don’t speak english. I love your vidéos but i don’t understand what you say. 😭 subtitules??
Awesome video!
Updated beauty/film room?????
Thanks for this all purpose primer in orchids. I'll surely pick one up this year and give it a shot.
I got an orchid plant for valentines. It was nice to see this video in my feed. Im going to save it so I can rewatch it later again
thank you for sharing. your orchids are beautiful. : )
So much good information.  I hope I am able to find the growing medium you use.  It looks perfect for the job.  Orchids are so beautiful.  Also, very inexpensive when you think about how a bouquet of flowers only last a few days.  Cheers!!!
very helpful
I absolutely love orchids! This video was so helpful.
More orchid videos!
You have a beautiful soul Christine :)
Thank you Christine, We are moving to Oahu this winter and cant wait to try all the tips that you gave....Hawaiicubs
thank you so much, i love orchids they are so danty , im so excited now that i know how to care for them i've asked florists but i get alot this and that but come out feeling more confused on how about their care , but now with this video i can replay and work on taking care of them thank you so much Christine have an awesome day
This was super helpful. I had an orchid I kept alive for 2 years and it bloomed a few times.  Then it died. I should try one again.  Thanks. ♥ Elle
Fascinating.
Thank you, I learned a lot! I have 3 orchids.
So sad, in New York ... Cold can't find any
Thank you thank you thank you so much.  You broke it down way easier. Hugs, Heather
Wow... Well I have 2 rabbits, a six year old daughter and my husband, so I don't think I could handle the responsibility! They are so pretty though! 💕💕💕
I miss pinksofoxy 😔
thank you for sharing :) your orchids are beautiful!
I love this video! Thank you  so much for making it! I am going to start growing orchids  and i was clueless on caring for them? This video had so much easy to understand information.  You have the best videos! Thank you  and please make more videos like this i love your gardening videos!
Wow! You know your stuff girl! Awesome info that I didn't know! You definitely made me feel like my thumbs aren't green, I have a lot to learn haha. I will be referring back to this video if I'm feeling confused about either of the orchids I currently have :)
Amazing video....you are really good in everything.  God bless you. From canada
thank you so much for this video! I had a lot of questions which you answered!!! thank you!  Now i need to save my orchid!
You have such a beautiful collection of orchids! In Canada they cost $25+ so you're lucky to get them so cheap!
I have an orchid and the leaves are a dark green but they have wrinkles, its not in bloom and I cut the stem a few months ago and its starting to grow blooms, its also not in direct sunlight. Why is it wrinkly?
Hey Christine can you recommend any good books for starting your own garden? I follow that garden guy you mentioned a while back here on YouTube but just wondering if there are any good books worth investing in.
Love all ur videos you know a lot !
thank you, this helped a lot!
Love this video and your blouse!!! 😍😍😍 where is it from???
Thanks for this video. I killed my first and only orchid and had been scared to try again with your tips I think I will try again.
Awesome video! Very helpful and well done.
Great video!!, now I want to get one since I know how to care for it...I've always been intimidated by them! I have to say, your plants win the jackpot when you pick them & bring them home :)
Thank you so much!  I ❤️ Orchids and have some in my house as well as Plumeria!
Thank you so much for this video!  Please do the next video as well.  I was just getting ready to change my media for the first time.  It was kismet!
Love watching your videos! Makes me kinda sad being stuck in my dry Arizona, but it's fun to see life in paradise!
Thank you for this well done and informative video! It'll be really helpful with our one in the bathroom.
Nice  :-)  Very Informative
Can you do an Invisalign update, your teeth look great!
ZOMG. You mentioned me AND said my name correctly. *fangirling* Thank you so much for making this video and making my day. xx
I so needed this, my blue orchid has dropped it flowers and I have't transplanted.  Thank you, thank you I look forward to helping my plant.
This was amazing. Thank you for sharing! I'd love to see other videos if you feel inspired. Your orchids are beautiful!
You're so beautiful
I just showed my husband the video, so we're going to try it with some that have huge leaves. How long do they normally take to rebloom?
I love this video so informative for me i been trying to get orchids for my home but was scared because they don't ever last long in other friends houses that I've seen them in.. Now  I know the correct to take care of and  make my orchids bloom.. Thanks.💖 please do another video on this or other plants I'm a gardener at heart...
Great information! Thank you 😊
Bless you for this video! My favorite flowers are phalaenopsis orchids and my hubby loves buying them for me. But I lack a green thumb with them. So many of them have come and gone and I always feel terrible when they die. I've researched and tried to keep them alive but always fail, and I think you just told me the ten mistakes I've been making....starting with watering! I live in Arizona, but you always see the instructions say to water them once every 7-10 days!!!! No wonder, they are thirsty :-(.  But your tips on "reading" the roots, potting medium, leaves and blooms is really going to help. Thank you, thank you, thank you!!! Please make more orchid videos.
Perfect timing I just bought a teacup orchid!!!
Wow, you just summed up what feels like hundreds of YT videos I watched on orchid care :-) good job!!
Excellent video. Well thought out and executed. Kudos.
This video was so helpful!  Now I know exactly were I went wrong on my orchid.
I love your channel!!:)
Very informative, thanks Christine!
I learned so much! I've always heard orchids were delicate but idk. They're absolutely beautiful flowers.
This was a FANTASTIC video! Beautiful and extremely helpful! Thank you for putting the time into it. I have been thinking about getting an Orchid for awhile and I think this was my push. :)
I appreciate the video! I've had a small orchid for about 2 years and I cut the spike off about 10 months ago. No new spike has started growing. :( It suffered from root rot because my mom didn't know and left water which pooled in the decorative pot. I've repotted with a mix primarily made up of bark and pearlite, and have noticed that a ton of aerial roots have grown over time after repotting. Have you experienced this? The aerial roots are quite long and I'm unsure whether I should try and repot again since something seems to be wrong with the mix. It also looks kind of ugly with long aerial roots, haha.
Good video. Can you do a hair routine or straightening your hair video?
Lol I don't really know about flowers but I just wanted to watch your video! Love you
Excellent tutorial! xoj
I really enjoy all of your videos ! Thanks for sharing so much with us. I love your natural beauty , fresh way of life , and micheals witty humor . Keep on keeping on. Love from the east coast USA .
Great Video. Florists have always told me to only water my orchid once every 10-14 days. Hmmm. Maybe that's why my orchids don't last.
Never thought of cutting something off of a plant as an "open wound". Maybe that's why they die soon after I do it :( I don't have a green thumb at all but this video taught me some things. Thanks for sharing :)
love your videos!! thanks for the tips!! :)
thanks Christine, this was very helpful I might even try to grow one.  xo
So when you cut the flower spike, how do you get your orchid to grow another? Will it ever or will you just have the green leaves. Thanks for this video. I Iove orchids but had no idea how to care for them.
This was so helpful! Thank you! xo
I just got a mini orchid and was going to look up about how to take care of them haha. Thank you for the advice love your videos!
Please do the next one!!
You change your YouTube name. I'm just curious as How you did that and why?
Omg, I am so glad you did this video! My poor orchid is sick and I've been looking all around for care tips. This came at the right time. 😄
What happened to pinksofoxy? I get so excited when I see you posted a video! Your DIYs are amazing!! Keep it up!
Love You, Keep Up these Amazing Videos. you inspire me and many others. Thank You
