“Screw gun”, these Americans will do anything to justify the second amendment.
Grass clippings are terrible for use as mulch. They can contain weed seeds that could be spread into your garden
Nice video; I'm a bit confused about raised garden boxes. These started out in inner city areas like rooftops or paved courtyards because of a lack of planting space and usually a lack of soil on a skyscraper roof. Then after being reported on in various women's magazine's, every woman in suburbia had to have a least one raised garden box, usually standing them up on top of...soil, in their yard, where there is sufficient amounts of good ole dirt, and sunshine. So...my thought goes to, what's the point? People are spending significant money and time to build a box to hold dirt...over the top of dirt, not a rooftop or concrete courtyard. There is no benefit to put a wood box of dirt over a yard full of dirt. A raised garden box will kill the grass under it regardless, so why not just till the yard into a garden, adding mulch and good soil, forgo the nice (expensive) wood box, save a tree and plant your crop. Bugs and dogs will still be an issue in a raised garden box. Just food for thought.
The teenager should’ve been wearing goggles when he was putting those screws into the wood…shame…
Awwww
puts grass clippings in dirt, to keep weeds out, probably just introduced a ton of weed seeds to the actual garden by doing so.
CEDAR?! Dude, just make it out of solid gold next time.
Now, how did Bella know he was looking for that piece of wood before he knew he was looking for it?
Don’t take the grass out. Put a piece of cardboard at the bottom and fill with leaves and grass clippings and then soil for the last five inches. It will compost away and kill the grass. Have done this for all my veggie beds
Teaching kits to drive screws with a drill. Kids, Use an impact gun
Thank you
Use non coated nails for an Organic garden
If I could afford to buy multiple 2" thick, 10' long solid cedar boards, Id just buy a commercial farm instead.
I recommend Woodglut to every beginner and not only.
Wow Ricky! Moving fast! Already got a house and three kids, and he's only 13 himself!
Is that the kid from Stranger Things?
Roger is goooood.  He knows his stuff; a lot of stuff.  Tomatoes are just an example.  Plus he knows how to teach young people who have to learn somehow.  The earlier the better.  In addition, we all have accents.  Just ask a Brit.
Those hands shows his hard work over the years...Roger that!
Just what I need. To make my front yard look awful
Accent commentators yet to get a life !
Next episode those kids will be installing a new roof.
Ricky's a genius, “That’ll give it even better drainage.” #goingplaces
Stata fertaliza
Those kids will remember this for life. Good that he made them help him instead of just watching.

Did anyone else get frustrated thinking about having to drive 3 inch philips head screws?

Gardening in the south is so much different.
Is this his family?
I would like to see these guys building this project in the rocky limestone soil of Texas.
Ain't no way im.holding a screw for a kid
Grass clippings for mulch. WITH  all the weed seeds intact..
Cedar! What did this thing cost? Like 500 bucks? To grow 50 bucks worth of tomatoes?
Elo
So many wrongs here. First off why does he have safety glasses but the kids dont? Second if your putting a useless 2 x4 in the corner then you should probably screw it off before hacking it off with a sawzall.
Screw gun = screw driver
I love his new England accent.
Please for the love of God, pre drill
Great video.. 2 thumbs up for spending time with your kids and teaching them and others how to create a raised vegetable garden!
“Dwolla twenty-five, pal.”
That zuchinni is gonna take over half the garden.

Seeda also halps keep dah bugs from eating yah gahdin
Or you could just buy a kit...joking THIS is how you do it!!
When he said use grass clippings to keep the weeds out I thought do you know  many seeds are in there from weeds?
Was this Masshole drunk? In the front yahhd? Let me drive these stakes into ya buried utility lines, not to mention sprinkler pipes.
Expensive potting soil or cheap straw bales?
this guy has never pronounced an R in his life
"Get the screw gun"  🤣😂😂😂
"Take your edger and Maahk out"
ATOH is usually pretty wholesome content, but with that lovely cedar and the kids, this one classifies as Wicked Wholesome.
I came here to see how to build a raised garden but too bad this guy is making raised gahdens instead.
What's a Guuarden
“Gahden”
Americans: calling a drill a gun. Nice
Getting your hands on 2” thick cedar boards 12’ long by 8’ish in wide is easier said than found.
Never heard of using grass clippings for mulch.
Hi, can you post the list of supplies needed?
ROGER who are these children?
Look at that location. First step put up 10 foot privacy fence. Then make garden.
Just saw this video and trying to build my own garden. Awesome to include kids!
Tip: miracle-gro potting soil works the best since it already comes out pretty wet what makes the moisture good for your plants when you put it in because it waters the roots
dad hitler
Fun things to do with the kids this summer.thanks for the video
plans from wood prix's plans are awesome!
The family finally got a girl. That little cutie pie will be spoiled by the brothers and she will be well protected as she gets older - haha.
Why use grass clippings for mulch, instead of just mulch?
This was fuckin great

"Here we get sun all day long" > last half of video it's in the shade. XD
This has to be in the Boston area or near. That accent is as thick as a jar of honey left out on a cold morning.
Child labour

Hi, I am going to be building a raised vegetable garden over the next few weeks and i just watched this video. Whats the reason for the sticks in a tee-pee and and the wire around some of the plants?
Roger,  Ever hear of square foot gardening? You can get over 30 plants in your 4 X 10 raised vegetable garden. Mel Bartholomew created the 4 x 4 and 4 X more feet square foot gardening. Mel gets 16 plants in a 4 X 4 raised bed. He has a 36 minute introduction you tube video on how to. Google away! You can feed a family gardening this way.  Sail On  Richard L. Darnell
Great job Roger Cook. Love the raised garden look.
Jim Crockett and Russell Morash would approve...'Crockett's Victory Garden'.

Great to see the kids helping out like that.
