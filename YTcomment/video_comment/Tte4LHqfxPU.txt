1tsp vinegar will cut the sweetness❤from Canada
Add cinnamon to go with it since raisins and cinammon go well together.
This Butter Tart Squares recipe looks so delicious 😋Stephanie.
Can I use a pastry Blender instead of a food processor?
In this Canadian’s opinion butter tarts must have raisins in them.  It’s even better if you simmer the raisins in hot water first to plump them up so they don’t absorb any of the filling.  Let the raisins completely cool before adding them to the filling.
Maple syrup is tradtional Canadian. We don't use corn syrup as much as Americans do.
As a Canadian and I have an original butter tart recipe from back in the day (best ever) it’s not a butter tart with out both golden raisins and walnuts!!
Great recipe , similar to the one I use, except I don't add any corn syrup, use oil instead of butter in filling and of course add raisins as well as walnuts.  Thanks for great demo !
Thanks great little recipe, just waiting for my first one to come out the oven 😁🙌💕 umm did I miss it or did you mention popping back in the oven for how long? and same 350⁰?
OMG just made these, only thing I changed was I used 100% pure maple syrup the rest I followed to a T. Amazing the short bread crust is melt in your mouth wonderful. This will be added to my Christmas baking book. Thank you for sharing.
Place raisins on the bottom and top with the nuts.  Use one spoon of dark rum as well .  Nothing better than rum and butter :)
Hi there Could you use parchment paper as well to just pull them out of the pan?
Hii mam..im a regular viewer of ur recipes..tried many of them and turned out good.Thank u 😍..if we totally avoid the corn syrup partwill it effect the texture of butter tarts..
These look great and I agree on the crispy edge. Please give the pooch a treat.
On my computer Twitter was doing a poll I guess you would call it and they were asking what I thought about your videos....was about 7 different things and I checked I liked them all.....!!! they were doing it before this video opened  !!!! I have never seen this before !!! Did you know that ? I wondered why they were doing that.....but I love everything about your videos.....I have no dislikes at all.....so you got all good marks from me  :)
Love it.....looks delicious.....never had just a butter tart.......can you make something using marshmallows ?
Delicious!
I am a Canadian and love butter tarts. I have made them with our preference, pecans. They are a lot of work so I am now going to make these, hoping they will be as good. Unfortunately, I can't add pecans as i have grandsons with allergies but I think they will be very good plain.I have followed many of your recipes and I have an important question. It looks like you are using a convection oven. I have that choice with my regular oven but dont use it for baking. I wonder if you can address the possible difference in times to bake, etc with or without using it. Thank you.
Excellent
Best thing ever, on yeah
YUMMY AMAZING THANKS YOU GOODNESS 🌟 JOY OF BAKING 💯 DAPHNE COTTON ALWAYS 💜 AWESOME BEAUTIFUL♥️🖤💚 BROWN FAMILY.
You are wonderful. I will be making these. I wish I had known of you before. Thank you for all that you know about baking and passing it on to us.
3r
A delicious ingredient to add into either the shortbread or the filling is toffee chips
I just made these squares.  They taste just like butter tarts and so much easier to make.  Thank you they are delicious!!
Looks delicious.  But I wouldn't call it Canadian.  All I have ever known is raisins for butter tarts.  Walnuts sound great.
Oooh all ur recipes are keeper...
Wondering why you give metric measurements along with regular measurements??  But Yum!!
Oh yum! A bit like the UK treacle tart :)
with nut allergies in my family what can I use in place of walnuts
Madame...I have followed your demonstration STEP - FOR - STEP while watching u....and I have the final phase in the oven as I type this.  I have NO doubt that these are gonna be OMG good.  I'm so geeked up.  LOL
As I write this there are 999 likes and 9 dislikes. I feel so powerful to get to choose if it becomes 1000 likes or 10 dislikes. MUAHAHA!!
This recipes is so much easier then making the tart shell or like many people now a days...they buy them!  Ugh!!!  Yes I am Canadian too, and like them with raisins. Thanks for this wonderful recipe.
wow I will make its for my familly
Hi Stephanie, if I do not want the filling to be too sweet, will it be OK if I reduce the sugar?
she originally had 9 squares on a plate.
I used both walnuts and raisins and I just made them for Christmas goodie boxes. They are yummy but they are very sweet so cut them small. I could get 18 squares by cutting her squares in half and that would be enough.
can you use maple syrup
My filling baked out very liquidy with a layer of caramel forming at the top. I didn't mess up any of the ingredients so why would it come out so weird?
6:41 ''kaiiiiiii'' lmao sorry, these look good tho
Is it okay to use peanuts? I hate pecans, walnuts and raisins! But I really like peanuts and I hope it's okay to use them! Thank you 😂👍🏻😅
Butter tarts are a taste of home for me. I'm a CDN living in the States and each holiday I make them but none of my American friends or family like them. I'm going to switch it up with these squares this year and see if it makes a difference. But for me, it's pecans and raisins all the way!
I am Vegetarian...is there anything I can use as an egg substitute, but still retain the flavor and texture?
definitely i'm gonna try this tomorrow! yum yum!!!
definitely i'm gonna try this tomorrow! yum yum!!!
This reminded me a Portuguese almond tart with a similar filling (with some milk added to it) and sliced toasted almonds. The base is more like a 'pate sableé'... I might try this with 'dulce de leche' instead of brown sugar.
You are amazing woman ms. stephanie..i always watch your video..
Do you think I could replace the corn syrup with maple syrup? Thanks for the recipe!
I replaced the corn syrup with treacle - it turned out something like a combination of butter tart and  treacle tart!
how  nice  your   butter  tarts . and  your  all  recipes  are  very  good   i  like  more   thank  you   stefni    joy of  baking
My Dear Steaphnie !I'm hungry now after watched from California at midnight!
Hey Stephanie! Could you make a video demonstrating how to do churros?
It looks yummy.. I love your baking
Hello from Russia! Tried the recipe today replacing corn syrup with honey, unfortunately top of the tart browned too quickly but the middle was still runny :( so the result was yummy but not presentable :( maybe Next time I should add some cornstarch to thicken honey? Thank you!
Hello Goodnight¡¡  First of all let me congratulate you on your great work, I am a big fan of each and every one of your projects. my name is Araceli and I am Mexican. I love your work and I really like to make one of your desserts, mainly your cakes  (are perfect).  The detail is that not understand much English and that really has been an impediment for me. Sometimes I use google translator but I do not translate correctly and is even more difficult to understand.  I would ask in the most humble way to Spanish tradujeras your recipes. I speak for many Mexicans who are faithful followers and admirers of your page and your excellent job, really. I would appreciate infinitely you to help me a little on the language , it is very difficult to me. I hope I have not bothered with my request.  Thank you very much for uploading your videos. Success and blessings at all times.  Greetings from Mexico.
Butter tarts (with nuts) are one of my favourite treats.  I didn't know they have a Canadian heritage though.  What a nice surprise.
Hello Stephanie, I can't find light corn syrup (or golden syrup or agave) in my country. Do you know if there is any substitute that I could make to replace it ? Thank you !
Those look AMAZING.  O_O  I can tell they're a favorite of yours.
his Stephanie. thanks for those. I have a request. please can u give me the digestive english cookies recipe. pleaaaaasssseee!!!

Looks yummy..I will try this out..Thanks..
I watched almost all of your videos and i love how you explain to detail *much respect all the way from S.A*
they look amazing
I love how you demonstrate it with tips on how to do it with other means like mixer or by hands.
Raisins all the way! 🇨🇦
Hi Stephanie......I am always surprised to find out that butter tarts are unknown to the non-Cdn world  :P  So glad to see you didn't add Coconut to these.....for some reason most people I know do add coconut to them and even though I LIKE coconut I think adding it to butter tart squares is just WEIRD!  Thank you for leaving it out.  :D
Super delicious!
I *love* butter tarts!
amazing! delicious! thank you, Stephanie!
I love your videos Stephanie! I have made half of them! I have a question I don't have a food processor? ~Miranda thanks!
