I watch this all November and December. 😅
5 years straight I have come back to this tutorial for turkey frying and it's still the best one. 👍
I literally come back to this exact video every single year … Thank you 🙏🏻
3.5 minutes per pound.
It's about that time for my annual refresher, 10 years frying!  Thanks Karl
Although I Don’t deep fry my turkey,your video is a very good safety advice video.👏👏👏👏👏 and I also like your back yard patio and barbecue system very well planned.🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺👏👏👏☮️☮️☮️🥳🥳
10:48 homie salivating for that turkey lol
Thanksgiving 2024!! 6 years with this video!
You can tell this video is PreCovid...dang frying kits are over $100 now...and still cheaply made Chinese nonsense
that's BAD Idea with the Oar tall guy might get to high and the 16 lb turkey could knock over that pot full of HOT OIL. bad Idea!
It’s that time of year again 🦃
Trust me,I'm from the South and I WILL eat that fat!
Where can I get those sneakers?
10 years ago. Wow
Our home burned down because of an electric fire. Its fixed, America and the insurance company fixed it, and now its thanksgiving. This year...its a deep fat fried turkey! Hell Yes 😁! Of course...outside.
Did I ever tell you about the time Keith tried to deep fry a turkey? 3rd degree burns over 90% of his body.
Look let's be honest,most of you dipshits need to just use a Roaster because most of you can't boil a egg without starting a Fire!
SOME PEOPLE WHO DO THIS FOR THE FIRST TIME BUT HAVE NO IDEA OF THE IMPORTANT STEPS NEEDED SHOULD NEVER GO NEAR THIS AGAIN. TEMP, AMOUNT OF OIL, AND SHUTTING OFF "BEFORE" LOWERING THE TURKEY!!!!!!IF ONLY PEOPLE USED THEIR HEADS!!!!
can you season a fired turkey before putting it in the fire
This was very well explained for my first time, turned out great.
Is that Freddy mercury 💀😂
This video was super informative, thanks for this. Wish me luck. Happy Thanksgiving!
What would be a good temp for the inside of the turkey ?
Very well done, thank you.
Back for my annual visit. Thanks again!
Quick question is vegetable oil good to use because of peanut allergies trying to avoid peanut oil
There are great videos like this all over the internet and yet people still burn their houses down every year. 🤦
Best video on how to deep fry. I’ve been doing it for 7 years and this is my go to directions.
Make sure it’s a class B fire extinguisher!!!!!!!!!!!
I use an indoor fryer from butterball, I will never go back to doing it outside. This will be my 5th year doing it. Plus you can use the indoor fryer for boiling seafood or other things.
d 10:48 Dude is so ready for this turkey and salavating so much he cant keep his spit in anymore
Great instructions
More like "How to Deep Fat Fry a Turkey Without Starting a Fire". Kids, do not try this at home.
With the super high heat point, you can reuse peanut oil 6 or 7 times, just strain it through a "cheese cloth" and store in a dark, cool place in original container or best is a huge 3 gallon Glass jar.
Does anyone have any recommendations on a turkey fryer 1st timer here
Instead of injecting butter , inject Bacon up! You will be so amazed at the flavor!
I followed the instructions and my turkey was awesome. Thanks for this video!
Dries turkey then gives it bath 😂😂😂 idiot
Makes sure bird is dry. Immediately submerges bird in water.🤦🏻‍♂️
This is the most American thing on YouTube
9:51 his face was very close to boiling oil
And I thought it was a cooking lesson from Freddy mercury
10:48 got a little spittle there
I can see this is your first deep fry. The burner and pot are brand new.
Tip from Chef Jerry. When you first measure for the depth of the oil, keep the wrap on the frozen turkey to cover then bird with water. That way, you can put it back in the freezer or allow it to thaw. I thought it was kinds strange to season and dry the turkey and then put it in a pot of water. That is funny.
12:oo that dog rocked a piss!!! In the unedited version it probably humps someone's leg
$50 worth of oil used once…
Your mustache is 🔥!
Would a grill side burner be enough to do this?
I'm thinking that you should check for the proper oil level first. Then dry it off and inject butter. Why dry it off and then immerse in water?
Deep Fried Turkey is way over rated. They always turn out over fried and Burnt tasting.
Hell yeah! Great vid! How tall is that fence in the background? 20 feet tall?
You should of measured the water first and then inject the butter. I usually like to mix my seasoning in the hot butter. But good job on the video my friend.  Excellent video!
It never ceases to amaze me the length Americans will go to, to be even more overweight.
Great frying, how's your brother Putin. Is he doing well?
The most dangerous thing you could’ve done is re light the fire
Oh man we did a fried turkey one year with my dads homemade rub and it was just amazing.
The best turkey frying video out there by far. Thank you
I'm sorry but it just seems so backwards to me. I still appreciate that the man put effort into putting this on youtube so long ago that T-Rex were still about. But still. Dry the bird, then inject the bird with butter, THEN use it to check the required oil level using WATER?  Sorry but no. Do all the measuring first, then flavour the bird. Use oil not water when measuring. It is water that is dangerous in this cooking. Water sinks in the oil, then boils, becomes a gas, and rises rapidly, carrying hot oil with it.
Sorry not me worthy.  -Him
This dude straight dumped the excess oil in the creek out back
Lol I’m here
Followed this step by step. First time frying a Turkey. Came out absolutely incredible and will never go back to a baked Turkey. Follow these steps exactly and I promise you you’ll have a new thanksgiving experience. I can not wait to do it again. Time to experiment with injections. Thank you for doing this!
to who that instruction , for me looks like for children under 12
3rd year using this video thanks !
I’m here again! Lets go!
Well done, gentlemen. But I can´t convince my husband to do it.
What temp should the bird be internally ?
Bout to fry my turkey in 2 hours HAPPY THANKSGIVING “22”
Can you season the turkey with regular seasonings like black pepper, salt , paprika etc
what a waste save the oil and reuse it!
Pretty sure you should measure how much oil to use (displacing the water with the turkey) BEFORE you inject and cover with butter...
11:47 “Let it hang there; let it drain for a second.” What I say every morning. 😅
Imagine how nice it'd be if you seasoned the turkey
WTF!! WHERE'S THE SEASONING...👀
Check out meat church. Much simpler
10:49. I cannot y’all😂😂😂 great video though. I will be using this method!
How has NO ONE mentioned you look like Robert dinero (however it’s spelled)
"These pieces of fat will just be a greasy mess and you're not gonna eat them anyway."  *SAYS YOU, GUY!*
Success! BEST TURKEY EVER!! Follow all of these safety instructions and you can’t fail🎉❤
Are you guys together,together?
So he dried it off well then put it in a pot with water?
Dry it inject it then measure the water? You season with butter then soak it … what is this mess
How to regulate flame?
Horrible video. I had stop watching after he dried the bird injected it then put in the pot of water to get the oil fill line. 🤣🤣👍
Thanks buddy
This guy is a joke just like the dude in the intro. At least put some rub on the Turkey! He probably wasted $100 on a bland ass bird!
Great video no bs straight to the point..
Thanks for the intructions to deep fry turkey
What the temperature of the turkeys when he pulls it out ?
Wheres part 2 of cutting and eating it
Best video ever!
This was a great video, however I'm still a little confused that first you dried the turkey off, injected it, then put in pot of water to get proper oil measurement..?
What size stirring paddle should I get?
Where can I get the exact cooker shown?
Get a longer gas hose pipe away from the burner.  use a fire retardant clothing, head and face fire protection when putting in turkey, foot safety fire shoes, there should be  turkey dehydrator.
Why did you cooked my country 😔
Wouldn’t it be better to do the water/measuring step before you inject it with butter?
This is a good vid. But the even easier and safer way is to get the Butterball Indoor Turkey Fryer. Works so well and the 🦃 tastes amazing.
Why are you dealing with a Turkey as if it was a bomb.
Do it outside.
No.
Man we need to see you carve the turkey I wanted to see what it looks like on the inside once you cut it otherwise great video thank you for sharing
No proof if it was a good cooked. Thumbs down
5am and i have never celebrated Thanksgiving before
This was good, but would have loved to have seen the carving
What’s the point drying the Turkey and inject it with butter if you’re going to submerge it again in the water ?
10:49 spit action lmaooooooo
12:11 Obviously the best thing to do with the leftover oil is to take it some place where from there it will either be transferred or already be some place to get turned into BIODIESEL and other products
I’ve learned so much!
10:49
Best informative video out there.
6:14 bruh it‘s 2 inches away
Hold on. Why did he dry the turkey thoroughly in the beginning only to submerge it in water? Shouldnt he have measured the water first before drying the turkey and injecting it with butter?
How to deep fry a turkey without burning your house down.... Do it in the yard well away from the house.
Why is America soo cool frying turkies while we cook them in stupid oven that makes it taste shite
10:55 Yes. Don’t cook outside in a rainstorm .
Of course u can dispose it by dumping it in your yard..what you talking about  willis.
Hi black mustache Latino Bull
why dry off first and then put it in water ?
Or their nerves
Is it ok to cook it in regular oil
Christmas time and doing it again
Thank you for sharing
I was one of the 4300, now I’m here 🥴
Jesus, been frying turkeys for 20 years. Everything is marked on the inside of the pot.
If not a fire extinguisher you can use a lot of baking soda and or a lot of salt too some up the grease . The pot cove close by and a thick blanket and ice water for you if you get burned . Make sure you put the fire out . And with the blanket and cool your skin of with the ice water .. that's what I'll would probably do . I remember when I was younger I spilled hot grease all over my hand cause I just learned how to put it away put didn't realize I had to wait for it to cool all the way down and I didn't want to get in trouble for cooking so late . After that I ran my hand under cold water . Than put toothpaste on it with a ice bucket next to me in front of a fan while I sleep . And I never a scar from it.
I would probably reuse it cause it's a bitch to throw away as is. . I Know how to clean it . Oh do it with bacon grease every now and then it is delicious.
Should of measured it with the water in the first place . You said there's seasoned it and dried it then wet it all over again wth don't your have to dry it all over again.
Why do Americans brine everything? It’s bloody awful!
Let it rest?! Screw that I’m ripping off a wing and a leg and going to my corner to chow down right out the oil haha 😂😋
Great video overall, but why did you dry your turkey before you put it in the water?
https://youtu.be/CKpQmot2-xw
Poor rich people, all the things they have to do, waste, store, eat themselves, then get criticised, and take up space in dumpyards, !!!!
10:48
Bro that audio tear scared the hell out of me when he said keep it level 😂 thought it just blew up
This was very helpful, my friend Keith got 3rd degree burns after an incident with fried turkey.
Lots of great tips here. Easy way on oil level is simply drop plastic wrapped turkey in pot, cover with water, make a mark with a sharpie marker or use your thermometer as a depth gauge . If the turkey is already out of the plastic wrap, place it in a plastic garbage bag, cover with water and make a mark on inside and outside of pot. Keep the tag from each bird for weight if frying multiple birds, cook time important.  Remember, kids, dogs and grab-ass don't mix with a 365 degree pot of skin scorching oil. I usually set up a folding table to keep everybody away just in case a game of football catch gets off target. Big piece of cardboard in the yard helps, fire extinguisher a must. Dry, dry, dry the bird...no ice in the bird is also a biggy. Most fires are immediately preceded by " Hold my beer", so be careful...especially if you're from Delaware or New Jersey trying this  If it's your first attempt at frying a turkey, maybe look for some Cajun or Texan in your neighborhood, may save you from becoming a member of the $27,000,000 club.
You didn't show the most manly part about it.....cutting into, and eating that juicy bird.
Why would you dry it off then put butter in/all over it then put the butter filled/covered turkey into water and basically just wash all the butter off?? why wouldn't you measure it before you dried it off and put butter on/over it???
Why would you dry and season the turkey then put it into a pot of water to measure, dump the water with a bunch of butter, dry the turkey out again for however long and then cook it?
I see that he is wearing sneakers around the pot of boiling oil. I think I would recommend, if possible, wearing some leather boots in that situation.
Cuts off the skin on the back that's awesome crispy and brown cause it's fatty but then proceeds to inject it with butter lol
He couldn't wait for it started drooling lmao
Europeans be like 😲
guy looks like putin
I feel like the fact that I’m watching this I’m getting old and I also want to fry a turkey 🦃
Excellent idea to turn off the flame first.
Do it need season
Very good video. I’ve fried a turkey many times yet I still feel that a quick video review is a must before starting your fry.
10:47. This guy's hungry
Lmfao at 10:45 homeboy drooling as he's talking, that turkey must smell amazing 😅
He’s already drooling just by talking about it!! 🤣
Take the ads off Jesus christ dude 🙄
Lol u use this video every year for the past 3 years lol
Americans eat like they have free healthcare
Safety tip #1: Don't drop a huge frozen turkey into hot oil
The "turn the burner off when you submerge or take the turkey out" is such a simple tip that completely eliminates the danger lol.
10:48 Somebody's mouth was also getting moist talking about a moist turkey!🤤
Thank you for the knowledge i just got two questions one why inject the butter before the water submersion to check oil level and two i was so looking forward to seeing the turkey be carved why wasnt even a small snippet shown
I would love to try a deep fried turkey.
The turkey got him drooling
Lol at him wetting the bird again...
Wow this is the greatest video ever.  First time doin it and my  turkey is a mafckinnnn HIT 🔥.. thank you CHEF
had my 13 lbs turkey in a pot for about 42 min, cooking temp at 300 it still came out hot at 198 inside, cant imagine having it being at 350 at the same time, whatever, i will never cook/ broil in an oven again. deep frying is the way to go
So dry it off... then put it in water. Nice.
How to fuck up a Turkey on Youtube:  Use an unreadable font! Don't rehearse the script to make the edits a nightmare! Stab it a shit load so that the juice and fat can all escape from the meat and leave it dyrer than the Sahara Add a crap load of butter which when mixed with the peanut oil is just gonna burn if it doesn't seep out and float the moment it melts! Soak with tap water to remove even more of whatever flavour is going to be left after you deep fry it. Fail to use a batter.  Why not use high-temp flamer gel next time?!
My injection is better 😂😂😂 1:55 love this guy
325 what? Fahrenheit or Celsius.  Instructions not clear. State burned down
Celsius or Fahrenheit?
Great video!!! Additional tip: Make sure you have a full propane tank. Or an extra one. Don't want to run out of propane in the middle of a holiday. It happened to me a few years back.....and man.... It's very hard to find propane on that date.  Thanks for this videos and all you do!!!👍👍👍💯💯💯
my man drooling as he was speaking, boy is hungry
I heat the oil up to 400.  Drop it in and the oil is around 350.  Perfect.  45 minutes later for a 14 pounder and you're good to go.
AMERIIIIIIICA : Yeah we dumb, we burn our houses down
What animal does peanut oil come from? We are cooking are turkey with vegan ingredients this year.
I watched this video to Fry my Turkey for Thanksgiving for the first time 5yrs ago!!  Very easy to follow step by step!! I still re-watch it every Thanksgiving as a refresher (Safety 1st)....  The Turkey comes out nice a golden brown!! The family loves my deep fried turkey every year!!!
I watch this video every year before fryin up a turkey.
Lol he dries off the turkey and then dunks it in a pot full of water
3 1/2 min per pound is too long for this sized bird.  Just ruined one by that calculation....shot way past 157 or so and closer to 180
why would you deep fry turkey...?
Can you use the cooking pot to brine the turkey?  If so why can't you measure the water level when brining the turkey and mark the pot before you put the turkey up overnight.  Then the next day after the turkey is removed from the brine the pot can be cleaned noting not to remove the mark while the turkey is air drying.  After the turkey is prepared then you already know how much oil to put into the pot and all the trouble you went through to prepared and dried the bird is not lost by measuring for the right amount of oil.
That’s a mustache that demands respect!
i really can't stand turkey and every year i'm forced to eat that , yesterday a friend said to me he ate fried turkey the other day and it was the bet he ever had and he is a chef , so looking forward to do this one of these days with the turkey i get every year with my points from Shop Rite and always give it away lmao
i burn that oil in my diesel truck
At 10:48 I hope he wasn’t standing ova the turkey
Turning off the fire 🔥 when dropping in the turkey was the best damn advice! We almost burned the house down the last we deep fried a turkey 🦃 😅😅😅
8 years later his shoes are still fire 🔥
Forgot to check how much oil we need using the turkey before we seasoned. 🤦🏽‍♂️ there another way to make sure we don’t  boil over ?
Awesome 👏
3rd time back. 1st mention of ‘stache - nice!
The annual watch this video so I don't burn the house down. Who says that there are no good Tday shows? Charlie Brown's Thanksgiving and the art of manliness. Classics.
What about how oil expands as its heated? How much does it expand after being heated up?
Hilarious tells us to use the monitor then he ditches it.  Clearly it takes 5 gallons only 😂😂😂
Who’s here day before thanksgiving 21?
I come to this video every year the day before Thanksgiving hahah
The arrogance of drying out the turkey, injecting it with butter and then filling the pot with water to measure the level of oil is ridiculous and a waist of time as now you have to dry it back off. Measure the level while the turkey is still frozen and write the level down. when your ready to put the turkey into the pot, bring the temperature up to 375 deg. and turn off the flame and then lower it into the oil. Once you have it in and no over boil then relight the flame and you will be safe. The temperature will drop to 360 deg. and that"s the optimal temperature to cook at.
So you did a brine AND and injection.
great video.  I've fried many turkeys.  However, it may make more sense to measure your oil line using water first, then brine, dry, inject....this is how I do it.
Your awesome, "Don't be one of the 4300 people who burns their house down" lol
I stuff it and fry it it a bread greened oil way.
So I did the water trick in my fryer and the water line was 3 inches above the max fill line. It’s only a 10 pound turkey and it’s a 30qt fryer. What do I do?
I watch this every year! Anyone else pour the oil out in the yard??? 😂🦃😂🦃
When do you start the timer? As soon as you submerge the turkey, or after you get the oil back to temperature?
Around the 9 minute mark, Freddie mercury enters.
Question whats the temperature of the Turkey that we should know its done or i just go by 1 lb-3 1/2 min
Excuse me sir. Whats the point of air drying if your going to dunk it in water shortly after?
This has been my go to video for the last 5 years
Can you measure your oil level in the package when thawed out?
Where can i find the pdf?
So he takes the time to completely dry the bird then puts it in a pot of water.  That makes no sense at all.
I only watch the video b/c of the mustache Cheers!
I would’ve measured water first before injecting the Turkey.
going to be my first time this year as a father, wish me luck and if you have any tips plz share. I'm a little nervous because I know its dangerous and that's why I'm here watching this video.
what s the internal temperature of the bird supposed to be?
Check your levels before you inject your bird. It's slightly silly to do this after injection.
This was an excellent course on how to be safe while frying a turkey.... even though I am a retired firefighter.... I had never considered some of your safety measures which made total sense and were great ideas ...  THANK YOU FOR SHARING ....  DOC
He didn't show us or cut into the cooked turkey! What a rip off!
Does it have to be the peanut oil when deep frying the turkey?
Do it outdoors
My son is allergic to peanut oil, can I use a different oil ?
4300.hundred now that's funny
Use the  level markings on the pot to under inch. Add oil as needed after setting bird in cooking oil. I take the bird out of the fridge and sit on the counter 3 hours before cooking to dry and warm to room temp. Get oil to at least 375 because temp will drop to 275, turn burner way up and gradually turn back until it stays around 325. Next day pour the oil through a strainer back into the container and put it in a deep freezer until next year or whenever and mark how many times oil was used. No more than 5 birds. Never cook turkey and fish using the same oil.
I’m commenting just a couple minutes in and you’re not correct. people start fires because they don’t properly dry out the turkey, too much water content and oil makes big fire and most people have no idea how to contain that type of fire because they freak out and try and splash water on it which makes it 10 times worse
Cover that thing with mustard and tony. Cmon
Can I ask why you dry the turkey before you measure it In the water?
How do you keep your oil from getting too hot ? Like above 325 or something how do you control the temperature of the oil ?
I know that the bird should not be frozen but how cold is ok? Like directly out of the fridge or let it warm up for a little bit?
KEITH?
And how do you brine a turkey?
Did anyone find the pdf he spoke of? I could not...
Remove the turkey like a bayonet fuse, basically.
we did that too, vid on my chanel...its quite a process and done in 45 minutes!
I had to custom build my turkey basket. The 1 that came with my fryer broke the day I bought it.  Every Thanksgiving I smoke my turkey for 3 hours then deep fry
Do we not season the turkey? Only inject it with butter?
what is the need to fry a whole turkey? wtf.
Would it be better to inject with unsalted butter to guard against the bird being too salty?
Good form Sir.  I'm deep frying my 1st bird this weekend on a friend's getaway upta camp. This is the most descriptive video I've seen to do this safely.  Thank you. ✌
High cholesterol heart attack special.
Its too much time frying
10:49 😅
Any one else just picture Mr bean with the turkey on his Head or am I just to baked for this
10:48 yummmmmm I want some of that extra stuff with my turkey
This is old but you would think measuring the oil level with water  would come before patting it dry or injecting butter.
So where’s the seasoning?🤨
Is air fryin safe
Dries the turkey really well... Then puts it in water to measure oil level 🤦‍♂️
He said he checked the Temperature when pulling it out! Why keep the Temperature a Secret? Poor Instructor I M O.
If Gordon Ramsey and Putin had a baby it would be this man
That would be foolish Deep Frying Turkey  in a rain storm
Thank you
I wonder if his wife ever found her keys.
Why use a "large pot" when there is a wok?
why the fuck dont you measure first before injecting if youre too dumb to subtract the weight of the turkey from the volume of the cooking pot by converting the units
Thanks for the info but I really only used this video to show my gf that it sounds like she’s frying a Turkey when she pees
Pero que gastronomía tan elaborada! Jajaja valientes estúpidos esta gente, son lo que comen.
Why not dry off and baste the turkey after measuring water. Makes no sense
I wanted to see him cut into it
Frying a turkey is like doing brain surgery
Hands downs Great expertise!!
So you put all the butter on just to rinse if off, Would of made since to measure first.
I skipped 2 minutes then I burnt my house down...definitely suing you bc you didn't put a disclaimer and you're fair game
Let me kill those weeds in the lawn
he was standing with his forehead near the pot while the oil level was jumping around....that s so stupid
That plastic thermometer actually works...if you're baking the turkey!
11:48 Thats what she said
My injection is better, I just wanted to let the ladies know ;)
I've never deep fried anything and got a brand new 30 quart propane fryer and im wanting to do my first turkey in it. How do I brine a turkey is my question or do seasonings and that without destroying my oil that I want to reuse again? Thanks for any help.
Does it explode
Is this a 30 qt fryer?
10:48 😂
Wouldn't this be a lot safer with something like an induction stove (or any kind of heater that doesn't use open flame)?
No seasoning?
I’ve never done this before I really wanna try it how informative was this. Thank you so very much for the slow step by step to not make any mistakes. Great idea keeping the burner off when introducing the turkey. And when removing the Turkey.
I hate to be negative....but so much for drying that bird....did the butter go down the drain....so no fire but you will be calling a plumber.
🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷
He can just cut that turkey into multiple pieces than fried it
You spit on the turkey man 10:47
Didn't know Putin does cooking tips
Where the seasoning y’all killing me bland ass food
Oil 40$ - Turkey 30-50$ - that’s expensive
I've watched this video about 4 years in a row and only question I keep having is. Where can I get pants like those lol
10:47.  I hope whatever that was flying out of your mouth didn’t land in the pot lol.
Havent tried it yet but I have to say this is fool proof video , awesome tips. Thank you
Just made one yesterday. I think these are good rule of thumb but I've always found water and moisture prevention is key
Rose are you kidding me
Can’t you put the Turkey 🦃 in the pot with the plastic from store to measure the water. ? Then mark the pot then marinate your  Turkey
Why the hell would you fill it with butter just to submerge it in water?
Don’t ever fully submerge seasoned meat in water. Either use some math to measure the volume you need, or just use his dunk trick BEFORE you brine the turkey. Goodbye flavor.
Take a swig every time 🦃 is said
My first time...  Karl Engel you’re a Thanksgiving ! Fry 2 🦃 the same day!
that turkey looks yummy...this will be me next month
At how many degrees did you put in the turkey , turkey
Great video because I always wanted to know do you use the lid and also why my burner did cut off around 20 minutes or so...2 thumbs up guys
I inject bacon grease and seasoned butter, its awesome
Every year I watch these same videos over and over again.
I keep coming back to this video every year. Also, I reverse the steps. I measure the water level first...THEN I dry out the turkey lol
Or you can just simply cut the damn thing to pieces and good few at a time
Where’s the link?!?
This year becouse of rain on Thanksgiving,  I'll be deep frying in my house . But it's ok.  I know want I'm doing . Only thing I didnt think of was the fumes all my windows are nailed shut and cant open the doors.  I have a blue mask on I should be ok . Wish me luck
Home boys face was right next to the bubbling oil
This is not only the best way to cook a Thanksgiving Turkey, it’s the only way. Also you shouldn’t brew a batch of beer at the same time and accidentally put hops in with your turkey instead of the beer.
Great video.. thanks!!
I would suggest a wet brine. The last time I did a dry brine, it was a salty mess.
Alright, who succeeded, who nearly caused a wildfire
Good job!  I agree with all of this. Thx.
7 years later and I still come back to these videos to freshen up my memory. Nothing but love for this guy and the AoM crew
Thhhorry carl i cant listen to you....you swollen tounge makes me want to burn your house down
Did this guy lick a fucking hot spoon or something?
he just washed away all his butter. a better way is to do the oil measurement BEFORE you even take the bird out of the plastic wrapping it comes in.
There’s no Cajuns in that 4300
Thanks,  going to try first time tomorrow.
Great video.
why don't the pots have the measurements for different weights on the outside?
thank you, i end up watching this every year to recap
Killing the fire before dropping the bird is a amazing idea. Best part of the whole video
10% about turkey 90% about not burning your house down and turkey safety
Diesel cars run off of old oil that's modified
If bill gates didn’t have a rich dad
I’m gonna spice my Butter Up then inject it
Ummmmm I bet that turkey taste good
great video thanks happy Thanksgiving
Nice apron
Who’s here right before thanksgiving so you don’t start a wild fire?
I'm guessing you dry the turkey after you use water to check oil level??? This was not shown.
This is stupid, why not fill up with oil, then take out the turkey, then heat it up? Extra-step with water is unnecessary.
Water measure before injection?
Can I use any margarine to inject into the turkey for example can I melt sticks inject it
nice
What do you want the internal temperature to be? He didn’t say….
Turkey is going to be super dark but don’t be alarmed because the meat inside is going to be delicious! 10:43
3 1/2 minutes per pound suckers!
Brine a turkey I've never heard of that before.
I feel this is the first time he's done this
How would Morticia cook a Thanksgiving turkey?  How would Wednesday?
No salt no pepper, nothing lmao
What about seasoning the turkey? How do you go about adding flavor?
4300?!
Skip the dumb water test, 🤦🏻‍♂️they sell the oil premeasured, at 3gal. and it’s sufficient for literally any turkey you’ll ever fry.
Great how to video. Great attention to safety. Thanks for your efforts in this fine video.
Can u deep fry another turkey right after the first one using the same oil?
No directions as to securing the hook to the turkey. Kind of important to not drop the turkey into a vat of oil. Just a thought.
So you just gonna skip the part of you carving it!?? Looked good but no view!! Lol
I’ll eat that turkeys ________
Stabbing that turkey to death w/ the butter injector.  XD
I come back to this and the carving video every year for the past 5 years as a refresher and I've had amazing turkeys with 0 issues (knock on wood) every thanksgiving.

13:53 wild injured doggo appears!!
And when you're done and you want to dispose of the used peanut oil, I just pour it out in the back of my yard where I dispose of my used motor oil, antifreeze and car batteries.
So is it wrong to just throw my turkey into the pot of hot oil like I'm shooting a free throw?
This turkey is way over cooked. Dry as a powder keg. So funny to watch beginners
Dark means you used Peanut oil and over cooked the bird. Canola oil and check the temp with thermo pen. Get away from the 3.5 min per pound. BS
I have deep fried turkeys since 1992 when I first saw it done. I am not one for a lot of rubs and crap. I want to taste the turkey. But, over the years I have found that Old Bay Seasoning on the outside of the turkey is an amazing flavor. Coat the bird with oil and then Old Bay. One more tip, when you purchase your cooking pot and burner, find a pot made of Stainless steel with a stainless basket. A pot tall and not so wide. Will take less water. The pot this guy is using is Waaaay too big. I can do a 12 to 14 pounder with 3 gallons of Canola oil. Peanut oil is too heave and expensive. Canola will cook a lighter bird and golden skin. Tip: at the end of the cook, pull the turkey and drop about ten ears of corn. Corn on the cob from the turkey oil is wonderful. About ten minutes on the corn. This guy here is a beginner. Don't go with the 3 min per pound. BS. Keep the oil at 300 degrees. When the skins starts to get golden, use a thermo pen and check the internal temp. 170 and pull it.
Dude’s mouth is watering way too much, I can only imagine once after the video is done.
20 lbs of flour 5 lbs of giblets a cement mixer and season to taste. That's what I do with the oil.
The only flavor that turkey has wich was butter , was take off with all that water . Why would you dry it up and add butter if you’re going to soak it in water . 🤦🏻‍♂️ that turkey needed some flavor I’m pretty sure
How do you regulate the temperature at 325?
I got it up to about 375 and when I put the bird in it dropped to 275 and never went back up
Thanks for making the video
Curious why you fill it with water to measure instead of the oil? Seems like an extra step.
Better idea to do the water displacement measure when the plastic is still on the bird.
Serious question , instead of adding water to the pot and turkey to find the full line for oil, why not just add the cold oil, fill, then remove the turkey , heat the oil, and then add the bird back? That way your not introducing water again after you already dried stuff ?
This has got to be the worst video on frying a turkey I've seen.  YouTube loves to censor its content.  This should be removed ASAP.
What size pot are you cooking in?
His pants.............
You kind of did it backwords but pretty much there right way
Karl said "let's talk a little bit about turkey." I would be remiss if I didn't say how disappointed I am he didn't take this rare opportunity to say "let's talk turkey" and actually be referring to  turkey.
Guest are always wowing when they have it the first time.
loool..... pat dry the turkey then give it a bath. love it.
My buddy Ellis told me this one time his buddy Keith ended up with 3rd degree burns over 90% of his body when he tried this. Man, the doctors had to call up other doctors cause they never seen burns on top of pre-existing burns before. It was wild.
Instructions unclear boiled turkey with peanuts
Why did they tag team the turkey drop?
Is it me or did he pat dry then submerge in water?
@10:47 already drooling over the turkey! 😂  Great video, it shows you guys took your time to make it. Thank you 🙏🏽
i'm doing it this year!
I know this sounds like a given to not fry a frozen turkey but the main reason people burn their house down(thats not mentioned here) is trying to fry a frozen or partially frozen turkey it's not the water on the outside of the turkey
Why you dry the turkey in the begining of your video if you put in the pot fill of water
So happy u added the safety precautions
Lol you can not use that oil again unless it is only used for turkey. Wtaf? Yeah you can strain it and keep it for a few weeks or a few more uses but don't cook with it. For one, once the oil is heated the molecular structure completely changes and is only good for frying. You do not mix fry oils. Period. You ever wonder why your fries taste fishy at long Jon's? Red lobster? They're sneaky mixing all the fried food oil to save money while your shitting water later. Edit: that's literally cross contamination. I couldn't imagine frying chicken, turkey, pork and then just frying some fries in the same oil. Literally against code bro. Turkey oil is for turkeys.
Thanks for this video
"Make sure its completely dry and add butter now stick it in water."  .....😳 😳 😳??
You look like Jack from this is us
I let my Turkey hang and drain everyday
Why would you put water like that? Just put oil in with the turkey already in there. Pull out the turkey, heat the oil in the pot and put turkey back in.
Freddy mercury frying a turkey ft vladimir putin
U look like a mix of Kevin spacey and Robert England
I am frying a turkey as we speak correctly and safely because of this video.  I just watched it before I started,  it made a huge difference thank you..... Manly!!
Instructions not clear enough..        my 🏡 is on 🔥F🔥I🔥R🔥 E🔥
Why did you do the water test after the butter?!?!?!?!
Beautiful backyard man thanks for the video
I wonder just how many Divorces were caused by house fraus not cooking a Perfect Father Knows Best Turkey ONCE a Year?
I have never understood this.  Why not part it up, then coat and fry each piece just like you would a Chicken? Why is there no Deep Fried Chicken (whole) Videos?  I'm Sorry, but deep frying an entire Turkey is Just plain INSANE! Attempting to Cook an entire Turkey all at once, WHOLE - Itself is just plain 1950's Father Knows Best Hollywood silliness!  Burning your house down attempting to Deep Fry a Turkey is called "almost" earning a Darwin Award!  It is quite literally the exact same as getting one of those silly "Participation" Awards that LibTard schools give to EVERY child that showed up for the T-Ball game that wasn't scored!  Everybody wins!  Whoohoo!
The methodology here makes no sense
He looks like putin
4300 idiots attempt turkey frying.
it was a bit bad seasoning the bird and then putting it on water
I’ve had fried turkey once and even the bones were edible. So tasty. Idk if I’ll ever get to try it again. Way too scared to try
thank you boosss!!!!
Better yet, do the submersion test while the turkey is store-sealed first before opening the packaging.
my guy dried and buttered the turkey only to  put it back in a pot full of water. am I missing something here
Skimming through turkey frying vids...I see this guys mustache, and I'm immediately IN.
About the oil, I use it to light my BBQ coal, there is a way to do it with 100% oil... You can also use it for candles in the yard...
You just rubbed the turkey with butter, patted it dry....and then soaked it in a vat of water thus washing off all the butter and making the turkey sopping wet again. I'm confused.
Is he the brother of michael scott?
Never use a metal pipe and 2 people it is just doubling the chance that someone is going to mess up and cause a problem and now 2 people get burned, if you cant handle following most of these methods than you shouldn't be playing with fire or cooking
You couldn't have cut that bih open in front of us? That's the best part. That's our reward for watching the whole video.
10:49 that spit 😂😂😂
You dry it off and get it ready to go with injection and everything and then you fill it with water to get a measurement of oil to use......omg that’s crazy!!!
Wouldn’t the butter just fry out immediately ?
why,,, WHY DO People MAKE-UP things..  note: NO JUICES NEED TO RE-DISTRIBUTE,,, just let the DAMN THING COOL Some!!
Yeeshhh....  Let's deep-fry Turkey and save Rojava.
injecting butter yeah cause deep frying  will dry it out yeah ok. Now how much Lipitor do we add to the turkey
While I have my oil hot I want to fry more than one turkey. How many can I fry at a time before I need to change out the oil?
Americans - “Everything is better with butter”
Do that before you dry your turkey off. Lol
Dude. Is. An. Idiot.
CLOWN!😂
Thank you Mr. Karl Engel six years and thirty days after you made this video...I`m now ready to fry a turkey during Christmas week. Remember people this video is six years old so he probably did the water test of how much oil he will need before he injected the butter but did not correctly edit the video to show that.
Thanks for the help I watch this video at thanksgiving and Christmas just as refresher!
3000 + people burn your house down a year from turkey fryers that's a lie
What's the easiest way to strain and clean your oil after use to save and reuse it?
Deep fry fat
So Putin cooks fried turkey now. And he gained weight too.
Most Filipino will laugh if they see this. 😂😂
I'm confused as to why you thoroughly dried the turkey and injected it with butter only to put the turkey in a pot and fill it with water. It just seems like drying the turkey first was redundant.
I came here after watching a video about a concern father yelling to his daughter before deep frying the turkey
Wouldnt using a flame-free heat source negate all the safery hazards?
Can you do a second turkey right after the first one is taken out.  Do you have to let the oil cool and clean it before using it right away again.  Can you do this in a cold Canadian winter day as long as it's not snowing . Thanks for your help, looking forward in doing this for an Early Christmas large family get together.
I would level out the water first so you don't lose flavor
Drop it
Why would you take the time to dry off the turkey, stressing how much you need to get it dry, then put it into a pot and cover it with water?
my dad just su-vied ours and 10 bucks says it was much better, barely any effort too
Optional: at @10:48 he puts extra seasoning into the pot.
Worst camera man ever.
Was the thousandth dislike.
So wheres the turkey? Hahahahhaa u didnt show the finished product hahahhaha
Ass backwards Chef, looks like 4301 fires of you listen to this Dingus
Is it me or does this guy have a weird resemblance to Vladimir Putin?
great video, i fried my turkey like pro thanks to you
Thank you for sharing this! Love to watch, you seem very skilled.
Thanks so much for the info this was my first time having oil spill over. Your advice to turn off the burner saved the day
dry the turkey then put it in a pot and fill with water........ this is the type of guy that burns down houses
That mustache looks fake.
10:48 the frying process LOL he drooled
I have to use vegetable oil because I have a peanut allergy
Guys he measures the oil line because he makes the turkey more dense when filling it with butter. More dense = higher the oil line
He reminds me of Stevie from eastbound & down
Is your Dad Freddie Mercury?
You should have talked and showed a fire extinguisher at the ready first!
That oil could be used as bio-diesel. Actually any cooking oil can, so yah, reuse or recycle.
Put that fucking thermometer down, damn
Thanks Fred
At what point did the head chef realize he shouldn't have put a "butterized" turkey into the water LOL...Otherwise I really think his advice is on point. thanks for the video
No season just butter. lol
2 years in roll I've watched your video works great thanks
Why would you want to if you want fried fowl go your ASS to KFC. Dumbest  shit ever!!!
Great video 👍 I've watched it at least 4 times over the past two years. Have a Happy Thanksgiving!
Great video! Love it
5 gallons of oil?
Why the FUCK would you want to deep fry a fucking TURKEY??!?!
So we wipe off all the excess oils before starting, then liberally coat the bird in butter, which is essentially, an oil lol.
43000 houses
wheres the seasoning
Happy Thanksgiving Folks
I stoped watching this bullshit after he sayed you don’t need to add spices 😭 unseasoned ass turkey he’ll nah
Allah,Allah,Allah,Allah,Allah!!!
Shouldn’t we do the water measurements BEFORE we inject and dry the bird? Lol
I seen people just throw it in while the fire is hot af lol
Where's the PDF?
10:48 say it don't spray it
Nice two ads.
Hell Freddie Mercury copying and pasting
What!?  Where’s the money shot...THE FINISHED  CARVED TURKEY!?!?  Bogus...Fail!!
Beautiful bird
How do people burn thier house down? Fry it in their living room?
What’s the meat temperature when it’s fully cooked?
at 10:48 he dropped a nice piece of saliva in the fryer.
How long does it take to heat the oil to 325°
Wait you said pat the turkey dry but then inject it with butter wich goes all over the turkey defeating the purpose of patting it dry. Then you measure how much oil goes in by filling your pot with water with the turkey in it wich takes away the butter you can see butter floating in that water.  also since your turkey was in water you now have to dry it again.
I kno
4600 houses dont burn down from it but ok.
He was really looking forward to this at @10:49
Should water your grass before cooking just incase
Omg I'm glad not his wife. He's stabbing it
So when you cut the butt off I IMMEDIATELY stopped watching and started reading the comments and I knew this was going to be a dudd 😂
Your Gardner showed up perfect timing to help I see lmao
First video ive seen from this channel and can already tell this guy is a firefighter lol
The Spit went straight into the pot🤣🤣🤣
This video is so ridiculous. "Dry the turkey and let it dry...then stick it in a pot of water". Not only that, you're stabbing that turkey with the entire length of the needle, you're injecting that butter directly INTO the cavity of the bird. That step was entirely useless. Not to mention you stuck the turkey into the water directly after. Lord have mercy.
This cooking method seems like way too much work.
Lady in the back was mad thick
As others have said  - Measure level in the pot BEFORE you dry it so you don't need to do the work twice - Safety glasses - No exposed skin - I wear an old leather jacket so if something does happen, I'm getting hot oil on my old jacket not my exposed skin.  You can fry multiple birds.  I usually do two turkeys and two chickens while the oil is hot.  By then, the oil is probably done.  I can save energy by using the heat already in the oil.  By the time the second bird has rested, the first can come off the hanger and go into the 3rd, and so on.  Be safe.
I don't believe it's necessary to drop the bird into hot oil.  I see no reason why you can't put the bird into the empty pot, fill the pot with oil, but the pot on the burner and then light the fire.  Whatever excess water that is in the oil evaporates slowly as the oil comes up to temperature.   Easier, faster and safer.
LAST STEP   Set the turkey down on the ground in the back yard, where the dog shits.
This must be his first time...
Do the part where you do a water test before you dry and inject your turkey. At some points I can’t tell if this is a joke video
Bruh😂
I really thought this was the guy was all the answers. “Call your local municipality and ask them how to dispose of the oil. There’s organizations that go around and collect it.”   I almost died thinking about the organization that goes around on Black Friday collecting peoples used turkey oil.
Check in on this video once a year haha just a refresher course
Wouldn't it be safer to put the turkey in the pot first, before heating it up?
Is it better to fry your turkey like you are doing or use a air dry fryer?  Which is better?  I know the butterball company has a air dry fryer. Please advise the better tasting turkey. Thanks
no one gonna y’all about 10:47
Shouldn't you have done that before putting in all that butter??
The oil is biodegradable.  You CAN dump it in the yard if you wish, once it's fully cooled, of course.
You do make good points, and it's clear that you did what I'm about to describe (though its not mentioned in your presentation) ....  Make SURE there IS NO ICE dtill remaining in the bird!  Ice + very hot oil = EXPLOSION! ...  and that ought to be in any cooks aswareness .     I did notice, too, that you didnt mention  drying the interior of the bird .. Again , that's an important step ...   And thanks a very good demonstration !
I just put my used oil in the creek
Did anyone catch what the temp was supposed to be?
After the turkey is done -what temperature should it be internally to ensure its totally cooked???
Glob of spit @ 10:49!!!!
Just compost the used oil and fertilize your garden with it.
Can it be Vegetable oil
What did I just watch..
You washed all the butter out of your turkey moron!
Was his mouth watering??? Lmao
First world problems 😂
Photo bombed by the dog
the only thing I would change is the pot. It is too big. The one I have is stainless, not are round and cleans up very easy. The one you have is aluminum and if you use the pot for others thing that have any acid, tomatoes and such, it will eat the aluminum and give the food an acid taste. JS
Thank you!
Say it don’t spray it! 😏
Did anyone notice him drool @ 10:49 lol
on the grass....
Dry the turkey really well.... then submerge it in water....   This video is rubbish.
Why not do the ejection after you dunk it in water
Ofcourse he seasoned the Turkey.  Butter and a glob of spit get the job done.   😂
good thing.
How fake is this guys hair color....looks like he did it with a black magic marker !
Measure Turkey water level before u even unwrap it!
How gen xers cook
Didn't even tie the turkey
Thank you somuch for sharing ur experience..i don't know what happen with my oven bcuz ain't work No more but i don't have enough money yet for the new ones so now my Thanksgiving this year 2019 me and my lovely family were conna eat frying turkey again thank you and god bless you
Should have showed the cooked turkey:)
How about doing the liquid measurements before anything 🤔
How long does this process take approximately?
This iz the real deal  Look at those mistakes
9:52 (Oil splashes in face) "OH MY GOD, MY EYES, MY EYES!!!!"
nice video...13:55 the dog looks like cartoon mr pickles !!!
10:47 he turned into a water gun
I don’t like eating turkey, specially with no seasoning
Too bad that you end up with a drier turkey that doesn't taste half as good as a roasted turkey.
So make sure it’s completely and not covered in water.... let’s put it in a pot of water before we cook it
So are we just gonna act like he never seasoned the turkey.
I thought for a brief moment I was looking at hall & Oats just for a brief moment
Great job, love the safety tips, but WHAT THE HELL WAS THE INTERNAL TEMPERATURE OF THE BIRD?! Can't believe you overlooked that critical piece of information.
idiot
You could’ve done the water/oil measuring before u injected the turkey ....
10:47 you just spat on the turkey lol
I love love fried turkey 🤷🏿‍♂️
Great information. Thanks for sharing.
Go to “How to BBQ right” channel and watch the smoked turkey recipe. It’s amazing.
Simple. YOU DONT! Throw that thing on the smoke for a few hours and you’ll never put it in hot grease again.
Men at work
MORE BUTTAH!
dogs not camera shy, took a wiz right in the middle of the Turkey video, lol
this is the least manly way of turkey frying
Best video i have seen.
this guy is an idiot, he injects the turkey then puts it in water..........
Looked like the most over cooked turkey I've ever seen fried. That end product seemed like it was subject to high temperature a little too long. The need to properly calculate the weight to temperature is also critical.
I'm gonna use a hot beef injection for my bird. The family always says it taste like fish Idk I like it
Damn no homo but that man in the beginning of the video has a killer mustache!
That PORN STACH though 🤣👍🏻
Measure for the water then dry then butter...
Thanks for the helpful video. Is there a particular brand/model of turkey fryer you recommend?
I hope that didn't get in the pot lol🤣🤣🤣🤣 but go video
Deep fry turkey 101 by Freddie Mercury
This sucked
Too much moralizing - for example, I do not need a video to teach me what to do with my used oil.  Otherwise good video.
Why not measure the pot level before you brine and inject the turkey?
What is the BEST method to Cook a Moist, Flavorful Gobbler?
That's a bland ass turkey!!!
What do you do with the used oil?  Dump it in the neighbor's yard.  :)
Its like this guys first time doing this
i am now worse off after watching this godless video
My Injection is better
WTF!!! Would have been nice to see you cut it open or at least see you eating it.. just to see if it’s dry or not dry🤔🤔
Since when cooking become so f*cking dangerous? LOL
That turkey is way over cooked. Legs are dry as will as the wings. Cooked too hot.
save up your money and purchase a stainless pot. A pot not to large as you have here but taller and narrow. Get off the peanut oil and try Canola oil. Keep temp to 300 while frying and keep the weight of the turkey around 12 to 13 pounds. Get off the 350 temp, too hot. Get off the 3 minutes per pound. At 300 degrees, a twelve pound turkey will take about 50 minutes. At that time pull the turkey up, use a quick read thermometer in the thigh. Pull it out about 170 temp. At 300 degrees, you will have time to cook the turkey through and have a golden brown skin. Chef Jerry
What other oils can be used for people that are allergic?
My injection is the best
Used oil???? Use it in your camp fire
the Butterball XL is the perfect turkey fryer  Buy one using this link: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072JFY8MN/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=mohamedkane8-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B072JFY8MN&linkId=0ecc7632b833de82fab5045328e65cfb
So hungry he’s salivating
If you love a carribean spicy 🌶 flavor...jerk marinade is awesome!
If you brine the turkey the night before you don't have to do any injections.
Dude you just dried off and injected the turkey, now you have to dry it again.
Drooler alert!
Wtf. He pat dried the turkey to prevent splatter when he fries the turkey. But then he submerges the bird im water LOL! Lost for words...
I think used cooking oils can be turned into diesel fuel, not sure how I think goes through a purification process, and yea imagine being able to sell that on how much money you could make.
Fml, his voice is like stepping on a plug
Too much talk
Steve Martin did a routine about semi professional.......
I followed every safety tip you offered, but burned my neighborhood down. I'm not sure that the oil you recommended was correct.  Penis oil cost me a fortune and smelled terribly before the inferno. I should have known better.
Why would you inject it with butter and seasoning and then measure it with water then take it out lol
Should have done the water pot test before you season.
Shouldnt you inject the butter AFTER u do the whole water thing?
Can you fry a live lobster the same way?
turn off the fire.  you are GOD of cooking, i swear!  90% of accidents would literally vanish over night if everyone did this.
Imagine if it started raining.
All that oil wasted on a turkey. What the heck is wrong with roasting it? You get more flavors that way anyway ....
He would be so hot without the moustach and that weird hair style
AS BAYRAKLARI ASS
How to add turkey to oil by using the handle backwards. Lol!!
When the turkey is frozen put it in the water and measure then. he used up 5 GALLONS of peanut oil, a small thing 1/20th of a gallon costs $8 so by my logic its 8 x 20 = 160 per gallon x 5 = $800 for the cooking oil. May just buy a used car instead.  But he said people will write and say they can baste better?  he does all the butter thing, then rinses it off in water?  Isnt there an equivalent for turkey volume per pound? I would take a tape measure, find the circumference of the widest point of the turkey, then measure overall Length and calculate the volume of that cylinder then convert to gallons. It will likely be the minimum as to how much peanut oil you need to use?  ALSO: what to do with all that once used peanut oil? it will go bad.  Maybe iHOP pancake restaurants can take it, they dont seem to care.
Excellent. Just one more step I did was to get the oil hot and then remove 2 or 3 cups of hot oil before putting the turkey in. I'm probably just a novice but my house is still here. You can add any hot oil back in afterwards if you are not covered.
Link doesn't work anymore.
Is this the same turkey that you inject  with butter make sure it was dry and then dropped it in a pot of water wow
Isn’t that the guy from happy Gilmore who took care of momma???? ( Ben Stiller ) .... dude u took the magnum PI challenge a pinch too far .... turkey looks good though, and tell chef butterfingers everyone has trouble with those thermometers lol
Doggo at 13:54
- Haha... If you use peanut oil you better make sure you don't invite any guests or, family members that have peanut allergy's or, your fried turkey feast will be a disaster.....
weren't you the lead singer of Queen?
10:48 As soon as he says process, something comes out of his mouth.
Drdisrespect and vlad putin droppin a turkey 😄
I'm frying my first turkey tomorrow and this video really helped.  Thank you!
*I love the air fryer.>>>**ur2.pl/1141**   I made a mistake in my first batch of chicken - the recipe had said 400 degrees F, and this goes only to 350 degrees F. The second batch was perfect, I cooked it for 15 minutes, turned the chicken, I used Kentucky Kernel Seasoned Flour - it was fabulous. I also did air fried onion rings, rutabagas, sweet potatoes. It is AWESOME. I'm so glad I bought it. My sister loved the results so much, she bought one too!*
Would have been nice to actually see you carve the turkey!🤔
Why did u dried it first and then put it into the wather? 🤔🤔🤔
I deep fried two turkeys over the thanksgiving holiday, with great success.  Thank you for posting these videos (Turkey Week Videos).  =)
a great video for several reasons and one is using common sense and one other is NOT frying it at 375 as almost all deep fryer videos are set on. I have been deep frying with oil all of my life and 350 is the perfect temp I think. the very sad thing is most who do burn their homes down through stupidity will never see your video!!
Come on bro, you are frying a turkey, not handling half a liter of nitroglycerin :-)
Ok why does his mustache annoy me lol.. He looks like a 15 year old.
If you turn the fire off you are loosing heat, so you are defeating the purpose of deep frying it anyways..
Kill the fire when putting the turkey in seems so obvious now.  OK, OK measure the oil after removing from brine THEN dry off the turkey before dropping in oil WEARING safety glasses can't hurt. Otherwise - I thought this was an incredibly useful video.
White people never clean their meats
Wonder if this idiot knows that bird is HOLLOW... your needle is going into the cavity moron. Might as well squirt it up its ass. What a phony
Why would you dry it then wet it again? Why not do that before the brine?
Damn I wanted to see the turkey carved up
Cringe worthy
You put the turkey upside down. The legs and breast should be at the bottom. The wings up top. That's why it looks crazy miss shappen.
All good except one part. You turned the gas off before putting the turkey in, but you should have put a temporary lid on the pot when relighting the flame. Just luck you didn’t get hit in the head or face with hot oil as it bubbled and was splashing out of the pot with your face that close. Other than that....all good
@10:51 boy started drooling 😂😂😂
Thats awesome.iv never seen a turkey deep fried B4 .if only mom knew this trick when the oven fuze went out one Christmas and the turkey was a few hrs L8. .We got it done better L8 than never. Overall was still a beautiful Christmas.mamma sure made miracles in the kitchen with what little we had. For a poor family mamma made sure our 6 bellys very seldomly felt too mu  hunger.
You and your partner seem very happy together and made a great turkey!
Grass=non flammable surface
Why didnt he messaure how much oil level he needed when he did the brine?
so to measure why not do it before you open the turkey to keep it from having to dry it all over agian
Never transfer the bird into the oil or the oil filled pan on to the burner while its lit
Please do a video on how to grow that sweet mustache.
Thank you
The hell with house burning down, I'm just happy you didn't become a nurse
Wtf the ad is 105:00 long lmao fail
Be sure it is still frozen and deep fry in your garage with the door closed. ....
Filter the oil and pour it in your diesel tank.
10:48 he drop saliva in the turkey for moist purpose.
Did he "season" his turkey with butter?? What the hell did I watch? And a brine is not a substitute for seasoning!!
That turkey looked great when you carved it.
Unbelievable that people are unaware of simple displacement. Too bad they didn’t pay attention in school. “ When will I need to know this?”  Now, dummy. Go dial 911
10:48 I think he on the turkey 😂
Good video brother🤙🏼saw this video the very first time I fried a Turkey and been frying ever since with no problems, Happy Thanksgiving.
4:17 Pan left for the butt shot. 🤣
Glad you don't have a dog to either 1) eat the turkey like the Bumpkisses in the movie "A Chistmas Story" or 2) pee on it.
It has no FUCKING FLAVOR!!!!
The best butter to inject is unicorn butter
I hope he wasn’t in front of that damn turkey around 10:48 N 10:49.  Holy moly was that a slop of slob come flying out? !
Also a lil slobber in the pot is a seasoning like no other
Didnt He just say dry the turkey, Lmao dummy
Some of you people are amateurs. I like this guys idea of frying a turkey.
I stopped watching when he put the turkey back in the water
Thank you Putin
4:22 dat ass tho lmaooooo
Quality video, I liked how you recapped at the end made it seem much more professional. It reminded me of public speaking 101 back in school.
Dry ass turkey I never understood the draw to deep fried turkey.
What in the fuck is wrong with you dude??? This dude is just fucking drooling the entire video. And his speech is consistently affected by saliva in his mouth. Get some medical help or something jfc
Came up on my suggestions... several years later.
This guy is a moron. Injection does shit and cutting the fat off is stupid. Lastly you need to maintain proper oil temp Thur our cookin process.
Wrong not water I use peanut oil then pull the bird out so it’s not wet from water heat the oil sprinkle spices on it then fry the son of a bitch
Ethpethawy
5:48 me trying to act cool when my mom walked in and caught me playing with my thermometer
This video is only for stupid people that should not cook. Talk to any person that know how to cook a turkey taste a lot better if u bake it in the oven
😍😍🤤🤤
CARES!!!!!!!!
that drool at 10:40 lol
Waste oil = Bio Diesel !!
They forgot to coat that bird down with Bojangles seasoning before they fried it!
The little clip of the guy running up and down with the fake fire was hilarious...lol
With His direction you will be 4301...
You’re hook was upside down.
Geez guys, if you're going to make an instructional video with safety involved, at least tell people to make sure their burner is leveled first.  Problem number two...  dry turkey and add butter AFTER you get it all wet by measuring the level in the pot.  You guys look like this is your first time frying a turkey.  And don't spit while you talk about the juiciness of the turkey.
4,300 people a year burn their house down?  Don't you mean to say that 4,300 start a fire by trying to fire a turkey?  Because that's a lot worse than the fires in California.  Let's not be drama queens.  Here's some real data for you:  "In the United States, more than 141 serious fires and hot-oil burns have been reported from the use of turkey fryers over the last decade, according to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission."
Why didn't he just fill the pot with oil why did he fill it water first?
It might be... Ha
Left out that the temperature you looking for in the meat of the turkey is 165F, check with a good food temp. Also, let it rest for 20 minutes after too to let the juices settle. bon appetit
wow that is a great Porn Stache!
You started by taking off the best parts,  turkey cracklins.   Nice idea about melted butter,  if you were to make that a compound butter,  that would be interesting.
After putting the turkey in make sure you spit in the oil for good luck.
This guy is an idiot,
I'll pour the grease down a sewer!
Noted.....never deep fry a turkey in a rain storm.  And use a pole and the guy from narcos to lower the turkey in, then still stick your hand in the pot.
we watched you cook it could have at least showed us the cut in to the turkey.
Bland ass watery butter turkey
I like the idea of using the water (in the sink) in order to find the best amount of oil to add, but why wouldn't you do that step BEFORE you injected the butter? (You can see some of it floating in the water, which of course is discarded). That part didn't make sense to me. Good video, though, Thanks!
Nice spittle
This Turkey CAN'T TASTE GOOD. NO SEASONING AND ALL OF THE DAMN BUTTER CAME OUT DURING THE WATER TEST SMH
I say NO!! TO Cutting off those tasty pieces of skin and tail.After its fried those pices are delicious
The timer sucks.  It shuts down the fryer every 15 minutes.  .  Dont be afraid.  I'll be doing it this Thanksgiving out side in the snow . Out side temperature will be 18 .
Wait the needle goes in the turkey I've been shoving it in my arm?
Another safety tip...put it in your yard over flammable grass and on the ground where it can be stable...  This guy is a joke!!  PUT YOUR FRYER ON LEVEL, UNCOVERED CONCRETE !!
Wish we coulda seen that turkey carving
Foo was drooling at 10:45
My son is allergic to peanuts. What alternative should I use?
I like how camera man checks booty out!
Or just get a oil free one that is safe healthier cheeper and less of a mess
Mildly interesting...
Do you inject the butter then measure with the water?
This guy is a dumbass.
10:47 Well, there goes some more butter.
9:51 Yes very smart to put your head below sight of any oil spillage.
You should shave that shit off your face .. just because you are wearing a cool flannel and all that Jazz it doesn’t work for you .  Bitch
10:45 for extra flavor 🤤🤤
Grow a mustache, buy a Butterball, (insert cannon fire here)
Thith video ith amathing
I’ve scored my pot on the outside and then scribe the weight of the bird. I have a 15# &17# mark outside the pot.
All the butter he injected is now in the water
gobble gobble bitch
Probably not good to put your face right up to boiling oil to light a fire
Why didn’t you guys show it being cut? That thing looked dry as hell.
Lite the fire again while oil is popping out of the pot, in your face!
Too bad you dried the turkey only to get it wet again in the bucket (after you injected butter) 😂
4:20  Camera person notices ur wifey bending over, has to get the shot lmfao! Then realizes oh shit, made that obvious!!
My thought exactly! WtF
Pro tip: always have your water hose near by Incase of a fire.
Just throw the old oil in your yard its bio degradable. It wont hurt a thing or do what he's say put it back it the PLASTIC  container so when its crushed in the trash truck it gets all over. Yeah I'll just throw it in my yard.
life of the party right here
Who the heck is holding the camera?! 🙄
All the unnecessary safety tips, then you lean over to re-light the fire and now we see your head and eyes within inches of the boiling oil.  Really, your safety instructions needs more safety tips before releasing. Just saying
Wouldn't it be more efficient to check the oil level with the water like that in the pot before you add the butter and write it off?
3:14 “Man, that turkey sure was good let’s review some of the safety tips...” he looked so done 😩 Not even going into detail about the taste, just straight to the safety tips 😂
6:49 he hittem wth the G stance!😹
so, you dried and injected the turkey then put it in the water... Beware folks, this video is not edited in chronological order. Following these directions will likely result in fire and injury.
cook your turkey in a turkey bag.  perfection every time.
Dude you are a fuckin moron why dry it and inject butter then wash it with water to measure oil why nt do it before u brine and inject what a joke lmfao
LOL spit flew out of the guys mouth at10:49, secret ingredient ???
Nice stash. SCHWING
Why would you add the butter before putting it in the water that just seems stupid ur literally washing all the butter away.
Meanwhile your face next to the pot while lighting up the burner lol
8:19 just woke me up and startled me. careful with the volume there boys
How do you secure the hook in the turkey? If that bad boy breaks out  while lowering is my biggest concern
Just use an infrared fryer. Comes out way better.and easy cleanup, plus pan drippings.
Inject the turkey after you measure the water so you dont rince all the baste off, unlike what this guy did.
KEEP CHILDREN AND PETS AWAY FROM THE POT WHILE COOKING!!!!!
Best turkey I've ever done was covering the bird completely in bacon and then smoking at around 230 degrees for around 6 hrs.  Have used hickory, mesquite and oak with excellent results.
I used an open fryer for years. It was always a fine line between frying and conflageration. Terror! I don't know why, but even in Tucson it seemed to rain on Thanksgiving. Not wanting to burn down the house I had it out on the gravel, but on some sort of cardboard so it wouldn't contaminate the yard. Ever see water hit 350 degree oil? The horror, the horror. The other thing was, no one helped me clean the pot or cook it. They darn sure ate it. I now use the Butterball fryer. So simple and safe. 👍😁😁
Nice video... shouldn't you measure the water PRIOR to injecting the butter? It looked like most of the butter washed away....
Couldn't have edited that tooth falling out...
Well done!!! Nice video
10:48 fucken dead 💦
Check the water level for the oil prior to injecting bird kinda as backwards
We got Freddie Mercury helping to fry up Turkey's now...
Looks like owen hunt off of greys anatomy
My Turkey would've been done by the time he finished drying the damn pot.
Dam that dude in the beginning looks like Freddy Mercury lol!
I did my first deep fried turkey thanks to this video.
This guy says dry your turkey off real good then puts butter all over it then throws it in a pot of water .... good thing he dried off his turkey
Why don’t you just resurrect the turkey and slap it directly in the face. Putting a turkey in a pot of hot grease is an abomination. Stuff it full of fruits and veggies, inject it with some creole butter and throw it on a smoker for a few hours. Deep frying is child’s play. Go check out Malcom reeds video on smoking a turkey and you’ll never want turkey any other way.
That turkey looked burnt
Looks like fun! I think I'll stick to grilling mine! Get to season it up that way!!
Dumbass!
And here we have "Pornstache introduces deep frying turkeys"
Fifteen minutes and twenty two seconds and you didnt show the carved turkey?!!!!!
@10.49 man start to drool out of control ,
Fucking stupid...step-1 you want to dry the turkey then let air dry for a few minutes step 2 dunk in water anyways
Maybe next time measure the water for how much oil you will be using before you injection the butter in the turkey you lost a ton of butter!!!
Cook a couple more, after the first one. We did this in the 80's with the water . Didn't account for boiling oil and overflowed and had a blaze. putting the lid on stopped the fire, and turning off the gas. I think , unless you have a very tall pot. use less oil. When you put it in it will be higher than the turkey because the oil is boiling and the water isn't, just a suggestion. Happy Thanksgiving and good luck, It is the most flavorful turkey to eat.It seemed like after the turkey started floating it was close to done
What's the point of drying it to put it back into water after putting butter on it? Like at least you could have just used oil, fill it and remove the turkey and heat that oil up.
You definitely need to reorganize these clips. You dry off the bird and inject it with butter then you put it in a pot of water and not dry it off before frying. Also you should have refilmed the part where you fumble with the thermometer like a moron.
Turn the fire off RULE #1
5:45 that thermometer is kicking his ass
@the host: Always wondered what happened to the biker from the Village People
How tf you burn your house down just pour some water on that oil there ya go
9:50 this moron puts the hook on a pole sliding all around. Then sticks his hands in the pot.. lol. Then spits all over.
Tip: Brine the turkey in the fry pot, so you'll know the correct level of liquid
8:21 jumpscare
Mmmmm turkey awwwwwww🤤
Thanks
So let me get this straight..when done with the oil I dispose it into my neighbor bush and throw the frozen turkey like a basketball into the oil???😝got it thank you I’ll try dunking it in the pot like Kobe 😜😈
The potential for Fryer 13:38
I good way to get rid of the used oil is to pour it on your neighbor's lawn
this must be your first turkey.
your pot is way too big.
I can fry my turkey with 1.5 gallons of oil, canola oil is my favorite. Peanut oil is too heavy and expensive. JS
I have a professional turkey frying pot. it is somewhat tall and narrow. It will fit a 14 pound bird which is the best size for frying. Any bigger and it will not get done inside before burning the skin. It is also made out of Stainless steel which will not transfer taste as aluminum will if you use it for anything with acid in it. JS
The first thing you did was get rid of the fat. That stuff is great after it is fried. Your turkey
Why fry? Timing?
The most important thing of deep frying a turkey in the weight of the turkey. Fuck putting a thermometer to see if it’s done. It’s 3.5 minutes per pound. I been deep frying turkeys for over 20 years. About the oil the pot has lines inside it tells you how much oil to put according to the weight of the turkey.
I was at an outdoor Halloween party. I had heard that they were going to have a deep fried turkey. From across the huge yard, I saw them start to lower the turkey into the boiling oil. I noticed that chunks of ice were stuck to the bird. As I run screaming toward the cooking area, orphans and old ladies are somehow flying out of my path. I got there in time to stop them but then got into an argument about the error of their way. After getting them back to a safe distance, I tossed in a small piece of the ice. They were certain that I had magical powers. The tree above the pot was the only casualty and it eventually recovered. People are so silly.
He stabbing the shit out that turkey. Like damn what he do to you when he was alive ?
It taste a lot better when it’s put into the deep fryer frozen
Thanks.  Going to give this a whirl this Turkey Day.  Love the Border Collie.... great dogs.
10:48 did he spit saliva into the turkey?
chef karl give really good and detail safety instructions how to fry the turkey.  we manufactured these turkey cooker hundred containers till now but i never try to use one, the videos give me hints how to improve it for a better product.  tks karl and art of manliness.
@4:23 ... dat ass doe, damn mommy
Excellent guide - thank you
Can you stuff it with stuffing?
I did his method and damn my turkey has no taste! now i really believe in salt and pepper. 😂
The man who invented the turkey fryer must have a HEAVY HEAVY heart.
Why the FUCK! Did you dry it before submerging it in water? I mean “Dryit before puttin it n the deal” idiot
Ok... seen the comments! So it's not just me that's seeing & hearing the foolishness!
That’s not the right way, you want the least amount of holes as possible
I think you should keep the bird in its plastic wrap then use the water method to mark the pot for the correct amount of oil.  Then remove the plastic and then continue with your recipe.
Once having worked for KFC for over 10 years from Cook to Manager, I have dealt with many in-store fires! the advice in this video is way over the top. All kitchens should have a fire blanket, wet chemical extinguisher or a powder extinguisher (Multi-Purpose), a smoke alarm and know where your gas cut off switch is located, that's all the protection you need to safely fry indoors. Most major fires happen because people panic and make mistakes with water which only fuels a GAS Oil fire. It is perfectly safe to cook from frozen, at KFC the chicken is drenched in water seconds before frying 4-8x chicken heads in a single fryer. However frying frozen meat compared to chilled results in different textures, some meat cuts work better than others but generally as a taste point of view chilled is preferred in both takeaway and high end restaurants.   If you get boil overs its because the oil level is too high or your dropping in it to quickly. It is also worth mentioning that when you remove your turkey it will continue to cook for the next 5-20 mins depending on how fast it cools. If you want to cook the Turkey before everything else and want to keep the turkey moist then preheat the oven at 65c then place the turkey at the bottom of the oven and on the top shelve fill a baking tray up with water, this will evaporate and keep your bird moist for many hours but you want to eat it within 2 hours because bacteria still grows at this temperature.
Its an Insurance scam :) burning house when deep frying Turkey Just saying
to hell with fucking turkey.every year it cost me over 700 in emergency and trip in ambulance. this dangerous shit should be outlawed.
Dudes a fuckin idiot honestly
If it catches fire don't throw water on it. Put a large damp cloth over the entire pot. If you throw water on it it'll explode.
oof, Karl would be a scary Doctor
Why wouldn't you measure in the pot during the brining process? Brining, Pat Drying, Injecting, Then dipping back into water is totally ass backwards.
Ive always wanted to do this with my old man..might have to try it with my older brother
Wow... 4300 people burn their house down every year frying a turkey?? Had no idea there were so many fucking morons in this country 😂😂
So thats called injection. I thought that was called syringe. Lol
Little bit goes a long way, lot must go further!!
OK, but where's the kuva?
Doggo
Love the guy with the tache;D
"Vesuvian flare up" lol?  Thanks for the video, I'm about to attempt this for the first time.  I've just double checked my home owner's insurance so I think I'm ready to go.  20-30 minute rest?  That thing isn't stone cold after thirty minutes?
Did he just say make sure the turkey is dry because excess grease causes fires but then he injects butter into it , WHAT
What is wrong with this picture? Let me get this straight.  Clean the turkey, dry the turkey and then put the dried turkey in the frying pot and fill it with water to get a mark for the oil level?  Why not put the wet turkey in the pot first to get a level for the oil? Then dry the turkey before you set it in the hot oil?  Did I miss something?
Thank you so much for giving us the safety tips for frying a turkey. I am planning to fry a whole turkey this coming New Year!
Thank you this was very informative
Do the water displacement test BEFORE you prep the bird! What a maroon!
Do 4300 people burn their house down every year?  Really?  I would think they learn their lesson the first time they burn their house down.
Number one rule when frying a turkey... turn off the gas when dropping the bird in,  no flame means no fire... problem solved
Burn your house down? Fry that shit outside.
6.685 kg is a bit over 14.7 lbs.
"Make sure you put it on a non-flammable surface" As he has it sitting on the grass as opposed to concrete. One of a number of contradictions he made throughout the video. If you're going to make a safety video follow the directions. 😂😂😂
What do people do with all that oil waste??
quick question to the dude in the beginning of the video: were you a serial killer in the late 70s?
Stopped watching when he Said he's not seasoning the Turkey..... C'mon.
this guy moves like a woman lol
i rather check that ass and see how good it is @4:20
“Don’t just jerk it out” you hear that ladies lol
how can any body burn their house down frying a turkey ??? candidates for the loony bin I think
Probably not the best idea to put your face so close to hot oil like he did at 9:52...😳
10:45 "Frying Process" 😂😂
fuck this homophobic channel
The statistic cited in the beginning of this video is not accurate.  "The U.S. Fire Administration said about 4,300 Thanksgiving Day fires occurred each year between 2006 and 2008, resulting in 10 deaths and 50 injuries. Of those fires, 69% were caused by cooking, with 97% being small, confined fires that caused little damage, UL said in a report released earlier this month. How many of those fires were from fryers, the report did not detail.  Based on its claims data from 2005 to 2009, State Farm Insurance said deep-fryer fires number 1,000 a year, with grease and cooking-related claims more than doubling on Thanksgiving as compared to an average day in November."  https://www.aol.com/2010/11/11/thanksgiving-warning-deep-fried-turkey-a-danger/  The Art of Manliness apparently does not include due dilligence.
Wouldn't it be better to do the water measuring before you dry and trim the turkey. That way you don't have to dry your turkey twice.
I've watched this video every year, for the last four years. Its a great video and I use it as a refresher.
at 10.48
Did it today, I’ll never have a baked turkey again. I brined it for 12 hours, injected it with Cajun butter sauce, rubbed it down with Slap ya Moma seasoning, it was delicious.
Why butter the turkey then fill the pot with water? Should fill the pot with water to level then butter the turkey
As far as disposing the oil, I take mine to the restaurant down the street from my house, and pour it in their used oil dumpster.
So we dry to get off excess water season and put it back in water
Deep fried my turkey this Thanksgiving and oh my gosh it was juicy and delicious! Man Shit! The family loved it, it was the first time in my life I deep fried my turkey, I will never go back to baking. By the way, we used vegetable oil not peanut oil and it was still great and juicy.
That turkey had you drooling ..lol
I watch this every year as a refresher before deep frying my bird.
You should wrap the propane hose in aluminum foil for safety
Lots of good inf.  ,but you never  indicated what Turkey Temperature was at 42 minutes ???...
I wonder if starting a turkey frying business would be legal?  ie: people bring turkeys to your business and you do the frying for them, mitigating the safety issues by having a trained professional in a controlled, insured, bonded place to do it. One could make money doing that.  Another way is to have fryers and turkeys and with enough notice from the customer,  fry to order and they can pick it up. Yes, i know Popeyes has precooked fried turkeys that you can heat up but they're not fresh
Awesome... nothing left out. Thanks. And happy Thanksgiving.
Are you David Lopez cousin
I'm not sure why you bother to dry it off so well then cover it in water. Dubious.
here I am every thanksgiving learning to fry a turkey again 🍽🦃
Great video and lots of good tips for newbies. Thank you.
put cover on to protect from your spit at 10:49.  truss up wings and legs,  he just flops it into all chaotic.  I'm out can't watch anymore. good luck if you watch this guy
as I watch it gets worse.  really? peanut oil has a high flash point?  try 320 degrees smoke point Sherlock.  heat oil to 325????  I go 225 or so and turn fire off when putting in and taking out.  this guy is a chef??  ya right.
this guy's a moron   few holes and keep needle in   and just repoke areas without coming all of the way out.  few holes= better.  good pots have oil levels on side depending on weight of bird.
This guy is a joke
I used this video to help me fry my turkey last year and it was amazing! I'm back this year for a refresher, Im ready for a round 2! Thanks for the tips!!
Can’t you measure the turkey first and then butter it bc u basically messed up the buttering
Thanksgiving 2k17 ? 🦃
Can you do two turkeys back to back same grease??
The guy with the seventies porn mustache wasn't wanting to lower that bird in with you, he was holding his side up so it would slide towards your side and burn the shit out of you. Why didn't you smack his mustache off his face?
So why even bother drying the turkey and injecting it before measuring the oil by water displacement? seems like that should be your first step. Better yet, use your brine as your measure. Too birds, one stone. No pun intended
13:57 would've laughed my ass off if the dog took a shit or pissed in the back.
Holy crap, let's add an additional fulcrum and two independent beings; if both maintain a level plane, then fine, BUT JEEZ! DNA!- (disaster narrowly averted). Just lower the bird slowly with your gauntlet!
i have iga grocery store do it....,yum yum
Great instructional video on how to deep fry a turkey safely.
Good vid. I think the stick with the helper made it more dangerous tho
A turkey fryer is a kind of tool which is used to deep fry a turkey. For Turkey air fryer replacement parts you can check here- http://www.fryerly.com/top-turkey-fryer-replacement-parts/
How before we brine and inject it with butter lets first put it in the pot and fill with water
Okay you are saying in the video to heat the oil to 325 but it says on your PDF to heat it to 275. Which is it?
HOOOT
I am deep frying a turkey this year. This is a very good video.
Instructions not clear enough. turkey now in space.
What a god damn shit show. Seriously one of the most funny videos I've seen in ages. From Freddy Mercury to the drool and zero payoff at the end. It's probably the worst cooking spectacle ever...(slow clap)
What do u do with oil once done?
Him patting down the turkey with the paper towel was completely dumb since it got wet again
I watch this video every year b4 frying my turkey
After Carl shows us how to deep fry the turkey can you break out  some We will rock you or under pressure?
Yo holy shit, Mario has really gone downhill.
pat the turkey dry with papertowels, then submerge in a pot of water :-/
Why is this hipster the first vid of how to deep fry a Turkey? He literally did nothing but hold a pole? Chef is pretty good but I don't get 2 things: 1. Why dry it off and poke holes with butter only to submerge it in water? 2. Turkey should be head up so all that hot grease which collects in butt end drains easier. Also - what's up with the lady bending over in the background?
What temperature do you fry at.
Man that turkey was good
Cant wait, i get excited about thanksgiving just for this reason
Don't let this deep fried turkey distract you from the fact that Hector is going to be running three Honda Civics with Spoon engines. And on top of that, he just went into Harry's and he ordered three T66 turbos with NOS... and a Motec system exhaust.
I'm gonna do this for my second go 'round this year BUT I now live in Peru and some of the materials are a challenge here. So, two Q's: 1) I've only got a super wide mouth pot; Which means the bird is going to need to sit flat. Is that a problem? Should the bottom not touch the pot? 2) Peanut oil is hard to come by and I can probably only get my hands on about 5 gallons. Considering I'm using such a big pot, that may not be enough. Can I mix it with another type of oil if need be?
IF YOU DRIED YOUR TURKEY 1ST THE INJECTED BUTTER, WHY WOULD YOU DROP IT IN THE WATER AFTER???
What kind of equipment or kit did you use?
Why would you dry the turkey ,Inject it then cover it with water? My family has fried turkeys for many years ,the skin is golden brown not dark.
This Carl Guy ,............Needs to go back to school and learn How To Deep Fry A Turkey.  "The Don't s"......(1)= Measure the oil needed via using water while the bird is still in the wrapper from the store. "NOT" After You have Seasoned it....(2)...Bring oil to 350-400 degrees Then Shut off Fire, then slowly place in then turn fire back on keep at 300 to 350. 3 min per pound
how big will a 30qt pot cook? 12-14lbs bird?
LOL. City folk
Total mouth eyebrow envy!!
Is it wrong that I found that factoid at the beginning pretty funny?
Thanks for the excellent video with all the safety tips!!
Brine the turkey in the frying pot.  That  brine water level informs the amount of oil and leaves a dry turkey to be introduced to the oil.
DON'T puncture it that many times when injecting. Poke once and move the needle into different directions. Less holes = less escape paths.
"Man thst turkey was good" -still wearing gloves
"Make sure the turkey is nice and dry" *proceeds to drown it in water.
10:49 actually drools talking about the meat 😁
you look like the guy from brokeback mountain lol
yeah alot of butter never hurt anyone
You dry the turkey, and then wet it in the pot of water? Wouldn't you do the water exercise before you dry the turkey?
Nice and healthy, injected butter, deep fried and salted! No wonder you are so healthy in America.
so what was the point in drying it when u put it in a pot of water after drying
칠면조 튀김이 정말 있었군
Your video says to heat the oil to 325 degrees but your pdf says to heat the oil to 275 degrees, which one is correct?
Why not measure with cold oil?
Why not just pour cold oil in the first place, then heat it?
Great Tips and instructions!!  Thank you!!!
13:55  Exactly.. the dog has it right.
who else was waitn for him to explode into pieces
love that spit at 10:48
idiot dried it then butter then water
goble oble loble
so he dries the turkey, gets rid of all water, injects butter, then put it back to cool water for measurement? I don't get it.
We tried this with a well-dried frozen turkey.  He's right.  I wouldn't recommend this method.
Should measure the oil before seasoning the bird
all that drying off the damn bird and to end up soaking it back in water again to check the oil levels
where the seasoning  at ?????
So what was the point of thoroughly drying the turkey if you were just going to put it in a pot full of water?
Guierllmo

13:52
Thanks, we r frying our turkey this year:)
I had to stop watching at 4:10 because - why would you do the whole covering-turkey-with-water thing after you've already wiped it dry and injected it with butter? Shouldn't you have done that to measure the oil first, maybe even before brining the turkey? Makes no sense and kind of kills this guy's credibility
@10:48 he like spits lololol gross
Comment if ur watching thanksgiving 2k16 ✋🏽😁
Thank you! Very helpful, however, the safety of my family is in your hands, lol.
10:48 he actually salivates while explaining the turkeys color LMAO DAT HUNGER THO
@10:48 you can see the spit coming out his mouth😂😂😂
This video was so helpful and informative, I love the safety tip precautions. Thanks for making this video.
do you keep the lid on when frying?
I'm sorry but I cannot take your moustache seriously.
So freaking tasty is mouth is watering, pouring out as he talks about how delicious it will be
1:15   I have never seen a more beautiful bird ever....  *sheds tear*
I thought it was a joke at first, but white people really don't season their food smh
That butter is glow-in-the-dark yellowy/green. That's fucking disgusting
" man that turkey was good "
Frozen turkeys need a warning label .
Great video! Thanks!
13:55 I thought the dog was gonna take a shit 😂😂😂😂
does he have teeth? lol
Thanks for your information, Best way to eat a turkey in my opinion
What happens at 10:49? Lol
The best way to keep your bird from drying out...DON'T OVER COOK IT
can you 2 with the same oil or would you have to change it out
Excellent video.  Thanks much.  Can't wait.
Love this Video! I'm frying my turkey for the first time this thanksgiving and this has made me feel more comfortable and confident that I will be able to do it with no issues! Thank You!
great video man I was a little nervous cooking my first turkey well after watching your video I'm quite confident
Completely dry the turkey, then puts it in a pot with water again .-.
I'm doing this this year, and I'm terrified.
Loving that Castro clone look, bro.
what the hell was the point of whipping the darn thing, if he then put tons of holes and butter (oil) all over it again? hahaha
"And help to really keep it from drying out. " Actually, poking a bunch of holes sounds like a sure-fire way of indeed drying it out.
@10:47 thats not spit he's adding to the pot, its his secret spices.
telling what temp you need the oil would of been really helpful...
that spit spew at 10:50 😖
nice crispy turkey thanks for the video
you guys are paying to promote your video....? the video you clearly copied from me? shaking my head...
Nice stash intro dude!
some eye protection around the hot oil might not be a bad idea.
Thanks for the advice, 1 thing at 10:47 seconds couldn't you have done this video without having spit drool out of your mouth dripping into the pot
did he spit
why wasting so many oil for just a turkey if you could fry it  by pieces. big demonstration for a simple thing..
thank you so much for showing me how to deep fry a turkey.
Why does it take 2 people with a pole to load the turkey in the oil when it's measured? But 1 person can take the turkey out of the oil when it's finished ? If the oil can still boil over if it's measured then 2 people wouldn't prevent a fire either.
i don't get it,you dried it the the butter then submerged in water again.....really?
"Art of manliness" I'm a woman watching this lol
That dude may be a Chef but that thermometer was kickin his ass! Good video though.
Can you deep fry a 45 pound turkey?
Who else watched the Gilmore girls episode where Meghan McCarthy's character does this?
Would you want to determine the oil level before you dry off the turkey?
Butter--the universal food solvent!
Why would you dry the turkey off and inject butter into it and then put it in water to measure how much oil to put in the pot. It seems to me, the sequence was out of order...
I saw freddy mercury at the end,
i use my old cooking oil as a substitute for lighter fluid...take a few paper towels and make a cup with them...pour a little oil on in the cup and light...build your pyramid of charcoals around it...works great.
Did you fry the dog later?
Сырое, атписка
No animals were harmed in the making of this video.
thith ith the betht turkey frying video ive ever stheeen!
10:49 spits at the camera. haha. Did anyone else notice that?
How is this a thing 4300 people burn their houses down every year?!?!? So let me get this 320million people in America and 4300 idiots 0.000013% of the population burns their houses down who cares it's only 0.000013%
didnt you just wash off all the butter when you dipped it in water??
This is silly..Pat all the water off the turkey..then put it in a pot and fill it with water
Was able to successfully fry my first turkey for the family fire to this video!  thank you for not making it overly complicated and for focusing on safety so I didn't burn my house down! #notoneofthe4300
this video gave me coronary heart disease 😭
Great video! Thank you for sharing!
"it will stay lit"
Awesome👍🏻
Great video. I've seen far too many videos and even heard of people that just go gun-ho with deep-frying their turkeys and lost property. Thank you!
Dam didn't he just inject it with butter and pour water all over it to measure the oil? #KindaBackwards 😂😂😂😂 still a great video I guess.
You need to raise the temperature to at least 3:50 if you want to cook your turkey at 3:25, because the oil will get colder and lower the temp  once you put the turkey in. Happy frying🍗
Awesome instructional! Thank you! 👍
First off you would put the Frozen Bird in the Pot and fill up with water as others have said, crazy to put a treated bird in wash away all your seasoning. Secondly, Don't be rude, find out if any of your guest coming have allergies, as someone highly allergic to peanuts, nothing ruins a Thanksgiving then having an Ambulance arriving at your Thanksgiving dealing with someone swelling up and not being able to breath from an Allergic reaction. There are many better oils out there you can deep fry your turkey in. I couldn't watch anymore after watching all the wrong advise he was giving. Good way to get sued dudes! Maybe take down or re-edit this video for some of its horrible advice!!!
How does that taste
....Flame retardant gloves, but no eye protection?
so get all the water off the turkey, let it air dry... and then stick it in a pot of water.
The gunshot at :20 represents the gunshot that kills the turkey
What do you do with the used oil?...  You filter it and use it in a diesel engine! [Rudolf Diesel developed his engine to run on vegetable oil]
Off the mustache alone, I trust this guy...
Lol @10:47 Turkey so good he was drooling.
at 8:19 theres a small mic cap, and I was watching this so intently that I literally flinched expecting  that pot to burst into flames... haha.
The lady bending over has very nice pockets.
This is one of the most 'Murica videos I've ever seen
I see at 10:48 you added your secret flavor shot to the oil.
Great Video... Thanks... Several years ago I purchased an electric turkey fryer from Wal-Mart. It was one of the Butter Ball Fryers that they sell. I got it for about $ 60.00. The turkeys I fried were about 12lbs.  I used the mix of Canola Oil and Peanut oil from Sam's Club. I have fried two turkeys with the same oil. They say you can use it up to 5 times before disposing it. make sure the oil is cold and put it into the original container. Also before storing the oil be sure to strain the oil. I used a big tea strainer with a funnel. That took all of the little stuff out of the oil. One good thing about the electric fryer is that you just set the cooking temp and forget it. You don't have to worry about propane. The fried turkey looked so good frying I decided to cut up 3 large potatoes and make a batch of french fries ! YUM YUM.. they were crispy and delicious.
I deep fry 20 pounders with no problems. And I use Cajun injector creole butter and Tony Chachere's Cajun seasoning in LouAnna peanut oil.
What is the largest turkey you can safely deep fry?
The proper way would be to leave the Turkey in the wrapper, place in pot fill with water and mark.
Nice drool @ 10:49
#backwards
I go by the directions that are embossed on the lid of my turkey fryer and it also has a maximum fill line embossed in the pot.
Fried turkey is for those turkey haters who thinks turkey is too dry, Fried turkey is as moist as it gets.
Put the lid on before you lite the fire so you dont burn your hair off lol.!!!!
This is considered a vegan horror movie.
Here's the link to the PDF of the recipe. The one in the video doesn't work anymore. http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/How%20to%20Deep%20Fry%20a%20Turkey.pdf
What was the point in using the bar, he held the hook anyway
Great video! I will use this video when the time comes this year. Question, would you have the link to the pdf file, as i clicked on the link provided in the video, but the page was not available.
Really deep fried turkey for Thanksgiving really????
This is a stupid V-I-D-E-O !!!!! your fucking stoned and spiting everywhere; spit all in your mouth.  Nasty ! Turkey did look good BUT you didnt eat it on the video !
He drooling over the damn Turkey, he's the only one that's going to eat 10:49.....
still waiting the carving part..still coming soon..
just toss the oil on someones lawn lol
L
Just fried my first Turkey. Thanks for the tips!
Wtf? I though the idea was to roast the turkey?
Hahahahaha look at that hipster tash
I like the Alton Brown method of measuring how much oil to use. Basically you fill your water one gallon at a time and keep track of the actual volume of liquid it takes to cover the bird.
Great safety information.  As a firefighter I see house fires every year that are started by improper or lack of safety facts when frying a turkey.
Thanks great video. I like your safety tips, no one else has ever mentioned this and how important it is.I agree and that turkey looks so good, I bet it has a unique smell as well
That drool coming off his mouth straight into the oil lmao
I put the turkey in the pot and then pour the cold oil in the pot to the proper level, then remove the turkey letting it drip. Then light fire and when oil is up to temperature put the turkey in the hot oil, excess water causes too many problems!!! This way you are sure of the correct oil level!
What the hell is up with the drooling at 10:49?????
randy marsh?
My turkey injection is better, and it matters.
you guys are funny
What's the purpose of patting that turkey dry and injecting butter if you're just going to soak it wet all over again? Makes no damn sense.
I just wanted to take a moment and say thank you for the awesome video. I followed it verbatim and made a wonderful turkey this year!!
10:48  Lol, when he spits.
caught the booty 4:20
A class B/K fire extinguisher and a lid the covers the pot are also good things to have around you in case the oil catches fire.
Great video... Have you ever added turkey rub to your turkey also?
Once I've fried my turkey 5 yrs ago we've never baked one again. I'ts so much more delicious. I have never had a problem. I'ts really just common sense people. The tips on here are all good, kinda like the way I do it, no problem! Happy Thanksgiving!
Some real idiots on this feed..  Is that the standard 30qt? I just bought the bass pro shop set up. First time at it, wish me luck or good house insurance lol
So what temperature should the turkey be to be done???
2:41 - 2:43 Paula Dean would approve.
I have always wanted to try this. Would it be safer to shut off the gas and then relight it after putting the turkey in the pot?
For the Art of Manliness to work, must I grow a mustache like that?
i bet u done best turkey fry
I think I messed up, my penis is stuck to the turkey.
Great video!!!!!! thanks for all the tips.
when all is said and done you have cooked a turkey in a super dangerous way and you have at least 5 gallons of oil sitting out in the open you have to deal with. Because you're a cheapskate you'll probably insist on straining it and stowing it away for future use, but we both know that you'll never use this oil again.
OK wait a minute here- did the guy just add the turkey to the pot after injecting it and then fill it with water to find the oil line YOU JUST WIPED IT DRY!!!..... I stopped it and had to comment- WTF!?
Peanut oil is wayyyyyyyy better
Smart thing to do would have been to use your brine to figure out the liquid level
Any seasonings besides butter?
My injection"s better!
Why did you pat dry the turkey and then put it in a pot of water?
Lol should have measured oil first but it's okay, MORE BUTTER!
totally ripped off all my tips and tricks for sure
Is this video screwing up for anyone else? I get about 6 seconds in and it flips to another video. Then about 6 seconds in, it flips to yet another. What's going on? Is it just me?
I always make sure my bird is dry! :D
Shouldn't you measure how much oil you are going to need first, and then inject the butter, you had already patted the turkey dry!!! Duh???
So what was the point of drying the turkey in the beginning of the video if you are just going to drown it to find its displacement? Why not make that your first step, then clean it up and inject it with what ever. Just a curious chef
Vladimir Putin Frying turkey
I expected fried turkey to look like fried chicken lol no lie. But seeing the way it came out actually looks delicious plus the butter ideas just makes it even better.
At 1:07, you state that it's the excess oil that splatters and causes a fire.  It's excess WATER that causes excess steam and splatters the oil onto the burner flame..   Also, measure the displacement of the water first, before doing any preparation of the turkey (drying, injecting, etc).    The oil will heat quicker if you put the lid on the pot and insert the thermometer through the hole in the lid.    Then remove the lid for cooking.
and check the weather:)
Very good safety tips... My husband will be frying our turkey for the first time this year , loved this video !!!!!!!
Whats the point of drying the turkey if you are just going to submerge it in water later, then you have to dry it again right? Would it not make sense to sort the oil out first and then the bird?
Why not measure the oil before doing anything to the turkey
That Bucket of oil is lie 30-45 Bucks i wouldn't throw it away unless you have money to spend.
I want that apron!
Magnificent safety tips. Love this emphasis.
10:48 - dribbles a bit lol
This is the first video I've seen that tells you to turn off the burner when you drop your turkey. Thank you so much. Ive been frying turkeys for 7 years and I have always done this and tell everyone I can to do just that. I also remove my pot so just in case oil does boil over it doesn't get on the burner.   Can I suggest doing your oil measure as your very first step. Before you brine, do your measure. Then use that water to do your brining. I find it just saves time and water. That way you only need to dry your turkey once.  Some people brine in the pot, but I like to brine in a food grade bucket so the salt doesn't damage the pot. Salt is bad on aluminum pots, stainless steel is a different story. I do like how fast aluminum pots cool down compared to stainless steel. Having used both, that's my preference.   I prefer Cottonseed oil myself. It has a higher smoke point and is a lighter oil, and flavorless. It also heats up and cools down faster. But it's also becoming increasingly harder to find and more expensive. I buy it when I find it, it's worth it for me and my preferences I think. Very good video. Thank you.
That mustache though
Watch the dog at around 13:52 mark.  Love these little pieces of reality sneaking into these videos.
Why not measure the water level BEFORE you dry and season/inject. You had to go back and dry the bird and reseason after you washed everything (or a majority ) of it away lol
man u wash all of your season off lol.......
not once through the video did he say what temp he has the oil at to cook the turkey
I WOULD DO THAT BEFORE SEASONING. :/
WTF? You dry the turkey then you cover it in water...   So many safety issues with this video...
Karl is awesome really makes the viewer feel as if they've known him their whole life
4:20. Hump day.  Bend over baby
That was really informative, thank you! Wish me luck tomorrow !
the pdf link is broken
I never heard of deep frying a turkey
Why waste 5 gallons of water and have to dry the turkey twice? You could have done the water bit when cleaning the salt rub (you call it a brine, it ain't a brine, it's a rub). Or you could have filled the pot with oil with the turkey already inside, even directly on the burner (burner off, naturally). Then take the turkey out, let it drain a bit, set aside and light the contraption. Easier, no?
Why did he dry the turkey off so thoroughly and then get it wet in the pot measuring how much oil he'd need?
Dead link at the end of the video...
That guy with the mustache is quite a cutie!
It's nice, he dried the turkey carefully, then put it under water! :D :D  but good job though ;)
Best turkey i ever had was fried with cotton seed oil.  I like this series of vids by AOM, but this "chef" guy seems so focused on "safety" that he does shit out of sequence, like dropping the bird into the pot and filling it with water.  Also, turning off the fire to drop the bird in is a dumb ass idea with these new safety sally friers, because you gotta put your face right up next to the scalding hot oil for at least 30 seconds (light, and hold the button down). _...(bad idea if you are as drunk as me on Thanksgiving)._  Also, look into disabling that timer shit as you don't want to get your face right up next to the scalding oil when you are drunk off your ass frying the turkey.  If you are going to be frying the bird in the middle of your yard, put it on some cement pads so that thing doesn't sink into your yard.  Dumping the oil into the compost is no big deal, if your compost pile is big enough, you don't want to suffocate your compost pile with too much oil.
That is a very tall fence.
What's next? How to instantly cook a turkey with C-4 explosives? hahahaha
But did you see the wife and dog?
That's a new way gotta get grand dad to try with safety
clogged arteries aren't very manly, though.
Fantastic special effects there Brett :P
loud noise at 08:20, my heart skipped a beat
