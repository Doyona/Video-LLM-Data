The one thing I think she forgot is the opening where you put candy in.
So cute. What size is the one you made in the video. The templates are really small and I don't know how much to enlarge them for the 1.5 in strips.
How can you do a emoji
where would the opening be to fill the  Pinatas?
Mini
Mi sentimiento preferido es la ternura ☺️☺️☺️gracias por hacerme sentir eso tan fácilmente

Can you smash it like a normal piñata?
This is hard to make because whenever I glue my tissue paper it starts dissolving and even if it doesn't, minutes later, it happens again
They are all so cute🍔🌮🍬🍩🍦🍉

I cant decide which one is my favorite... oh i know ALL OF THEM!!!
great video, I'll do this when it's daylight.. :p I have one complaint.  YOU DIDNT PUT ANY CANDY IN I mean I know why, who would want to whack the cutie burger. But stillll. See now I need to find something I don't like to make into one so I can bring myself to hit it..
I THINK IM FINALLY DOING A DIY!
they're are so cute...but as a Mexican I have to ask: where is the candy?  that's the best part of piñatas. candy.
the fringe is real
so cuuutee
These are sooo cute
I loved this video. I am definitely trying this out.😍🤗
From your choices of recycling, it seems like you have been having a lot of pasta recently haha 😄😄!! I LOOVE Barilla pasta - well I love all pasta in general, but Barilla is top notch in my book 😉!! I've been having a bunch of pasta lately, and I have to say, the whole grain variety has pleasantly surprised me with how good it is - both good for your health and good for your tummy and tastebuds 😄😄!!
Do I have to use your stencils
AHHH RACHEL THESE ARE SOO CUTEE!! 💖💖 I've always loved crafting and DIYing with paper-type materials, because it seems like there is never a limit to what you can create!! I love all the pinatas, but I do have to agree with you that the hamburger one is my favorite - the sesame seeds give him a cute little freckled face 😄😄
wow smart way to recycle
Those can be for a 4 year old kid party. (≧▽≦)
omg THE TACO!! its staring into my soul!!! :'D <3 so cute!

They are all so cute!! I'm totally going yo make them. Your hair is growing long. Does it usually grow long? I cut 8 inches of my hair 3 months ago and its already back. My hair is a couple inches past the edge of my back. I'm gonna cut off six inches soon but it'll all be back in 1-2 months.
Omg! Usually I don't like making this kind of stuff (only seeing it look all cute for everyone else) but I seriously wanna try this now! Definitely something to do this weekend!
Galaxy cakes ❤️

Ah! I luv the watermelon!
I LOVE THIS!!!
She didn't link the scissors like she said
piñatas kawaiiii
That's cool.  A great idea for a party favor if you don't want to get a big piñata for a party, but you still want to have the fun of breaking open a paper/cardboard candy container.
☺️I absolutely love your DIY videos, please do them more often! You are amazing at what you do, both baking and crafting! I've made several of your baked goods and crafts!😋🎂 Continue what you are doing and you will definitely be getting 1 million subscribers!😝👍🏻
After the cute pinata cake you did recently, it was fun to see how to make these real (again cute) pinatas! 🖒😊
Making this for my birthday💘💯 plz reply btw I love your videos

Hi Rachel my names Eman l am Kurdish I love you
It's so good hi I am new
Don't you actually put stuff in a usual piñata😅 But they look really cute though 😻👍🏻
these are super DUPER adorable. i think disney character pinatas will be extra cute :O especially if its tsum tsum form. wouldn't be too hard to make, right?
They are sooo cute and pretty!!!!!!!!!😇😘👏👏👍💖💕
Hot Do you gut the candy in theire
So cute❤
Aah they are soo cute but the watermelon is my favorite
my favorite ones are the watermelon and the piece of candy!!!!!!:-D
What an out the candy hole??
That's a good way to recycle ♻️ keep it up
The ice cream stole my heart ?!!!!!!! IT IS SO So SO SoSo CUTEeeeeeeee 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍👍👍👍❤️❤️❤️❤️🍦🍦🍦🍦🍦🍦🍦🍦🍦🍦🍦🍦🍦🍦🍦🍦🍰🍰🍰🍰🍰🍦🍦🍦🍦🍦🍦🍦🍦🍦🍦🍦
Piñatas 😍😍😍 Kawaii  My sister love the taco piñata.  Those piñatas give me the idea of making one with Santa's face for Christmas.
My favorite is the little piece of candy! It is so cute!
Gold tissue isnt gold ahahahha
my favorite pinata is the donut
You can make pizza instead of the watermelon :)  😃😉🍉🍕
Sooooo cute!! I've never seen something like this before. I love the taco and burger
I love these omg so cute😍. the candy looks the easiest I might try that one😆
No candy inside??
very cute. just an editing critique: you should flip the footage where you are constructing them so that it's facing us, the faces being upside down at first was kind of funny but by the end made me a little dizzy.
I wonder if it's easy to smash
Can you use this like real pinatas? Like putting candy in them and beat them, haha, or is it just for decoration?
love it❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ 😍😍😍😍😍😍😎😎😎😎😎😎😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍👬💙💙💙💙💙💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💙💙💙💋💋💋
These are sooooo cute!!!

Just so you know, this video came out the day before the video game Viva Pinata's birthday!
They are soooo cute💕 I love the taco and the donut!
If anyone's interested, you can make other piñatas using some of the same shapes as the ones in the video!  Just as a few examples, you could make a pizza slice using the watermelon template, a chocolate chip (or Oreo) cookie using the donut template, and a variety of fruit wedges (watermelon, apple, orange, lemon, lime) using the taco template!
They're too cute to whack the shit out of them!
u should of added a little opening to fill it with candy
your amazing at your job! #!! omg
