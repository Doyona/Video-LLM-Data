I was 14 when this came out. My brother and I used to watch these videos all the time to try and emulate the builds. Getting close to 30, how I miss those days!
This is litr our childhood. Your channel just randomly popped out in my head, im 20 years old now😆 but it feels like yerstoday. Thank you for the memories man.
Nostalgia. NGL you’re a big reason why I’m still buying lego in 2025.
Who’s in 2025?
The house was built in 1966
This video is my childhood
2:34 I think the ceiling is better when it’s colorful. Reminds me of the “Vibrant” interior style for the Eclipse Towers Penthouses in GTA 5.
What's your address, Jaystepher?
9 year old me was amazed at this creation and 17 year old me now is still amazed by ur creation🥲
Came back to watch this video after 8 years, brings back so many memories of watching your videos , this video got me into your channel back in the day. 12 years later it is still an amazing build.
Ahhhh memories
The tree looks better than me
wow I remember watching this for the first time maybe around 8 years old and I’m 19 now. I would always copy your builds and your videos were something I looked forward to each upload. Still trying to be involved with legos a little bit building some sets here and there but these vids are great memories.
Impressive
The QR- Code on the driveway does not work 🧐
Hi subs here, im filipino working here in kuwait 😍 love your videos, may i ask if u have pdf for this project of yours 😊 i would love to do this in the future 😍 thanks and keep on inspiring us 🙏👍
I’m just coming back and re watching all my liked videos from years back from when I was younger, and this was one of them. Now that im older I can really appreciate the craftsmanship and attention to detail that you have in these builds! Still very very impressive!
awesome
Make a model of YOUR house
dang, I used to watch these videos when I was 5 or 6. I’m 14 now and they still hold up
Why haven't lego Hired Jaystepher for ideas on Lego sets yet? This man has Ideas
Your truck won't fit through the garage door. Maybe you should get a new truck that can fit through the garage door.😅😅😅😅
Cool!🤘🇨🇦
I love this house and all the details. Awesome. Keep on Brick'n
I haven’t seen this video for so long I’m glad it came across my recommendations
Hi i am trying to change the inside of my lego simpsons house ,any ideas ?
I remember watching this video the day it came out. I was around 7 or 8. It’s 3am right now and as I was trying to fall asleep your YouTube channel randomly popped into my head and I knew I had to watch this. I’m 18 now and I still think your videos are amazing. Thank you for giving me an amazing childhood and opening up my imagination and giving me some of my fondest memories as a kid. Definitely gonna start watching you again. Who knows, maybe I’ll crack open my old box of legos and get some good ol’ nostalgia!
i watched these videos back when i was like 9 or 10 years old...I'm 16 now and they're just as good as they were when I was a little kid. Thank you, Jaystepher.
yesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyes
Wow, just some good old memories. I watched this like maybe a year after he uploaded this and I watched it about +100 times and when I watch it again it always feels like you get to see something new. 😇🙂😄
Look at that house.
Love it!
6:19 lmao why would you put your office right beside the kids bedroom? 😂😂😂😂
Hi J, I enjoy your video but there were some flaws. Nothing is perfect but, I loved the house.what would happen if Lego had made set  where  you
Jaystepher: The kids room has a PS3 Me: * has a PS5 * Also Me: Looooooool poor
Did he actually put a Police ATV in the garage?!
Amazing house!
The memories are coming back...
Eso  se parese  ala  casa blanca
Some of these rooms are from other vids
How long did it take to build this? (Serious)
That’s a cool house
Nostalgia
I found this video as a kid and it popped up in my recommendations. I wonder what this would look like with more modern pieces
amazing
I just seemed like he built his house in LEGO because he kept saying mine mine mine
Thanks for being a great part of my childhood❤️
I remember watching this when i was a little kid and when you said that theres an atv in the back i was like theres no tv back there what is he talking about? lol
The memories. I grew up with your videos and I can recall the hours I spent watching these home tours. Thanks for making my childhood!
Not gonna lie but u should be a architect. U fit the job
The house you built is super cool!!
Who realizes it's on his bed but col build I love it I'm definitely gonna try to  build it
Hey
i finally found this before the decade ended, hands down my favorite lego build
Where did you get the books at 6:36? Love this MOC.
I  can see that you took some things  off the kitchen
If that was a real house of if I was a minifigure I would totally buy it
that is so cool i been wanting to do something like that do i go on the lego website to get house moc?
I would like a tutorial
wonder how it felt to break it
I was just thinking about a house with a wraparound porch and a swinging chair
6:05 It is the YEETstation 3.
This is so cool your one of the best builders of lego for houses
you're sound heard like Tobey Maguire
Aaaaaaawwwwwwwweeeeessssoooooommmmmmeeeeeeeeeee!!!!!!!!!!!

The fact that this came out 7 1/2 years ago amazes me, thank you for blessing my childhood with these videos.

Dear jay -  where do you buy your lego?
I LOVE THIS HOUSE!!!!!!!!!I wish could make a house like that!!!!
no lie, you should design lego sets. you could sell them for like 100 bucks (depends on size). Nice job!!!
?
which is the number of your lego
where you buy those legos
cool
Do you have a tutorial for this?
How do you  make all of these lego houses??? I made one lego house but it is small.
you have to try to talk about the house
This would be a great 3d blueprint for people who wants to buy homes. Much better visual look and feel to it
Do you have a tutorial on how to make the kazibo and I like ur work I am gonna make my first custom module home soon keep up the good work
Your good at building Lego house
Really impressive build! As for the garage door, you have to have something for the top of the door to "rest" on when it's in the open position.
Cool I'm making mine lego house right now:)
You are so talented jay I think you have a great imagination
when he showed the colours underneath the roof and when he said 'No one not gonna see it anyways ' I'm thinking... ' But You just showed it us doh?'
Cool!: )
This is my favorite house I was wondering if you could do a how to make video I love all your videos my name is Mack  I might my on YouTube channel
Very big
Superb build! Very inspiring. Quick question, if you have the time: Can you give me stud dimensions for your perimeter? It's hard to count them by just pausing the video. especially with dyslexia. I'm pretty curious. I think it's probablh around 80-96 accross the front. Any way you could confirm? Thanks!
Does all of yourlego houses that have a garage fit your pickup truck
God where do you get thease alsome ideas cool and alsome oh do you live in amairica xx

Anyone ever tell you you sound just like Kermit the Frog?  Love your videos, especially the houses but also some of the tutorials for smaller stuff. I'm planning to try to recreate my own house in LEGO soon so they're very helpful for getting ideas on how to build the house and furnish it. Great work.

Jay,  dont you hate it when you work so hard on something you make and then it turns out to be "just a bunch of mixed bricks sticking together"? i hate it when that happens. and when you get bored of building a good project. LOL  As i had mentioned to you about my city, perhaps you could take a look at my video response, and comment on it. if so, thatd be wonderful! A.S.A.P.  Ryan

Dude this house is awsome!!!!!
oh :(
Just awesome. Yet maybe you should add some smooth bricks which will form paintings on the walls here and there - just the walls seemed so empty. Have you demolished it already for other projects!?Would not have heart to do that myself.One big fatty like from me though.
sit on it
Be lego lord
Awesome instead of Being lego Nerdy

jaystepher what should i use to fill my 5x7 living room leftover space it is by a window
I hope that you get 10,000 supporters on lego cuusoo it looks really cool and if you do get 10,000 supporters and lego makes this a lego set I would buy because It is a really cool lego house
I want this! It's awesome!
what do you do with that do you like keep it together or take it a part so you can build other LEGO Projects since you ran out of so many pieces?
Sebastian palacio.i like the kichen
I like the master bed room
he has a page
where did you get the bucket for the toilet
where did you get the water brick piece like thing
that's a lot of tiles
you should make an apartment
Oh yeah I might have an idea for keeping the garage door open.But please don't get angry because it might not work.Find black pegs(you use the piece on the garage door) and some how try to get it to stiffen then it will stay open.
Hello.I am a big fan of your video's, I have made my own lego house but I need some help on bedrooms.I am such a big fan because you helped me build a kitchen!!!!!!!!Thank you!!!
Nice I'm working on a house right now

How do you get all these legos
Extremely cool piece very detailed it looks awesome GREAT job thanks for the ideas also.
You should make this a lego cusco so it can become a set
SO FREAKING AMAZING
You are good
Holy cow!  Man you are really good at this, and you kinda remind me of Sheldon Cooper, in a good way!
A Lego PlayStation3?! AWESOME!!! :D
This stuff is holy God blessed you with that imagination man you should be proud of youreself really much.If this was at stores,I will go running to Toysrus and BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!
HOW DO YOU MAKE THIS STUFF???!?!?!?!
OMG carn't belive my eyes
thanks for the idea of the roof me and my cousin jackson jones made a lego bank with the roof idea :)
I just love your vids
no store
You should put this creation out  I WOULD SOOOO BUY IT
IT IS NOT GREAT IS AWESOME
Luv yer work, J. Notes on gettin pieces apart: The little crescent wrench that comes with many city sets has a flat end that works well with tiles. If yer base plate isn't connected to a structure, you can flex it (carefully) and pieces will pop loose (with practice, this is a very effective technique). If the tile has studs on top of it, you can attach a brik to it, then press down and tilt sideways at the same time (this works great for flat pieces stuck together, also). Hope that helps...
Awesome
You should do a tut on this house
I cat believe you made this out of your imagination lego should pay you to put this as a real set. if it was a set i would be the first to buy it!!!
OMG!!! this thing is HUGE! i watch all ur vieos and i LUV them all! :D
Beautiful wish I had lots of lego
OMG! OMG! SO BEAUTIFUL!
U guys should check out my latest video called Lego School
How do you get the tiles off of your base plate
cant u get them, from the airport set?
OMG dude yuor amazing!!!! But a word of advice make the back yard more full like fill it with flowers if yuo have some left ower or put some more pines near the sidewalk.
That looks hard
nice house!
great design. I'm working on a huge project, as well.  a Lego Target Store
i Give it a 12! :D
Where would you get thouse window pices u used in your front yard?.
