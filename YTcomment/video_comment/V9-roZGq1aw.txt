The lighting was very blinding at some parts and made it difficult to see what you are doing. Additionally, even at 1/4 speed, the video is way too fast.
Des it make a big difference if the piping fabric isn’t cut on the bias?
For heavens sake slow down. You might know what you are doing but so fast we haven't a clue
Slow down please, i can slow down rge audio but the video is far to fast
Such a shame this is filmed in fast motion. So informative, but had to keep playing back and playing back and still I didn’t manage to see how things were done. so irritating.
How long should the zipper be?
you did not cut the fabric on the bias, Why?
i'm going to use this tutorial today. looks like it will be very helpful. is there a way i can slow the video down?
The camera is going to fast it is impossible to follow
Thank you for this, I’ve just made my first cushion with piping and zip following this and I’m really chuffed with it x
This goes way too fast
Talking too fast
A little slower would have been better.
Your music was much too load I couldn't hear what you were saying, no need for music in all the vidios, I think. Xx
Too fast!!!
Too fast, hard to follow
It was too fast
Can you please tell me me why you add extra fabric to the zipper?
Not everyone is a DIY Mommy. I'm a 70 year-old dude who just may give it a crack at trying to sew some new pillow covers. The old ones are disintegrating before my eyes with the help of my lovable dog, Coco Chanel. Thanks for taking the time to put together this training video. I agree with one comment. It was a little fast.
Far too fast.Possibly not fro beginners
Wish you could slow it down.
You go too fast when you show how to.
I totally agree with below, too fast. This is  a good video, but whoa will have to watch it dozens of times. Where are the measurements please?
Olá, bom dia! Pena que não consigo entender....
Beautiful
WAY TO FAST!  This video is for the experienced.  You never showed how to sew the pipping pieces to the front & back sides.  I think you just said now sew the pipping pieces to the blah blah blah blah.

I have sewn at least 6 pillows using this tutorial. Thanks so much!
👍🌹👍🌹👍🌹
The fast forward mode makes the whole thing frantic and impossible to integrate, without stopping and repeating over and over. Many others have noted this as well so perhaps you should take it seriously. Information inaccessible as it stands.
Much too fast. I slowed it down and you sounded stoned LOL
wow that is just to fast for me...........
I love this! A couple of people asked but I didn't see an answer... How do you join the ends of the piping?
It's good tutorial but it's too fast
This vid is Soooo well done. I’m sure it was not as easy as it looks to film. Keep up the great work and thank you. God bless you!
Very difficult to follow. I was hoping you would explain in more detail since you mentioned in the beginning that this is a more challenging way to make a pillow case.
Great tutorial. Easy simple
Wayyyyy too fast. Why do I this if you can't go slow enough for understanding. Those flying fingers are rediculous
Too fast... cam you re-‘do or do a new video please! ❤️🙏
very super
Definitely not for beginners. I find it hard to follow :) nice work though 👍
Verrrrrry beautiful
Nice but why must you go so fast with your verbal instructions and the video?  I'll subscribe but I hope your future videos are a lot slower.
Please slow down are all your tutorial this fast? Life goes by fast enough and I do this for enjoyment your tutorial has great information but I'll have too watch again and again I'm in the process of making a pillow and was looking for this information thank you for the tutorial.
I don't see where it says the zipper length?  Great video, I'll be trying it today!!
What seam allowance are you using?
Very nice. Good job! How do you sew over a zipper when adding zipper stop? I am scared that my needle will break. Thanks
Great tutorial :) You are a great seamstress! I will be doing this over Christmas break.
Am I the only teenager here?😂
Great tutorial! I sew lots of home dec and quilts but this was one project I was putting off till now, the piping scared me lol.  The other thing that made me hesitate was the fabric, I only had so much and I had to fall in love with something that was discontinued and can't get more of.  It's cotton duck from Waverly.  I thought you had to cut the piping on the bias to get around those corners but yours look amazing! I ran to my sofa and sure enough those piped pillows don't have bias cut piping! Now I'm sure I have enough fabric! Thanks!
To fast.  I couldn't understand some of the measurements.  And how do you join the ends of the piping??
I can't believe that you made the entire cover without once ironing the fabric! Ironing is always needed to do a truly professional job. Otherwise, your video is very good. Thank you.
Love your tutorial I use it all the time for my home made cushions thank you x
What if you want an exposed zipper? What different steps would you take?
Hi, I have a question about the 3" piece for the zipper.  When I fold 1/2" on the 3" piece and 1/2" on ur back piece, My back piece is 1" to long. Is it suppose to be a 2" piece for the zipper or where am I going wrong?  Thank you for the tutorial, I did enjoy it.
What size pillow inserts is this for?
Great tutorial. Sewing some pillows today :)
Great tutorial, thank you. Going to try my first zipped cushion with no binding this time.
make piping from bias cut strips fabric
Hi DIY Mommy! I LOVE this tutorial and I'm going to take a stab at making these! One question, how long was your zipper? (I'm going to use 20 x 20 inch pillow form too.) Is it just as long as the fabric you cut? 21 inches? Or is it 20? Or is it shorter? Thank you!
This could have been a great tutorial but I believe the calculations for the back are incorrect.  It would have been useful to see how to join the piping, and how to sew about the corners for the piping. Shame
I have a quick question, when you cut your second piece of fabric (for the back panel) you mentioned to cut it 1 inch shorter than the front panel which you cut at 21"x21".  So, do you cut the back panel 20"x20" to accommodate the zipper panel?  Thanks for sharing, great video!
What a great tutorial I've been making a lot of pillow cases without zipper and piping. I might just try this one of this day.
Hey! Love your channel. I subbed. ♡ Hugs from Sweden
