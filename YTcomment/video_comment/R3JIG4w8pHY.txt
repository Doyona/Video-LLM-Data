I am recreating this look on 2020.. (halloween 🎃)
What ever happened to the bruising tutorial?
Omg this thumbnail scared me
Who else is amazed that she has had the zombie pallet for this long
I actually get cuts around my eyes when I wipe my eyeliner too much to perfect it
"Literal" lmao I see what she did there 😂
Hyello zombaes- I love that

2:11 that's what you did
I should be filming for my YouTube channel , but instead I’m beng watching Mikie
this is so gross & violent!
Don't be scred
Could I just use lightly pigmented red and purple-ish eye-shadows to bruise over my crease? Ya girl is too cheap to get cream paints, lol
woah
You should do a sugar skull makeup tutorial
“How it feels when you have to take your eye makeup off so many times cause you didn’t get it right”
I'm doing this for Halloween at school now  Is there a way to diy scab blood like with red paint and corn starch or something
As soon as she said click here, I got a notification...
2018 and this video just slid past my home page😂😂👌🏼
2018?
Oh my god her eyebrows you can see her natural shape
What does cut crease like _actually_ mean though
my friend says "it's ok that you didn't get dressed and we forgive you"
Can u do this look as eyeliner without the alcohol activated paint
I’m sorry bUT HER WINGS THO
the title made me laugh so hard 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Try to make this using only glam products
THIS WAS 4 YEARS AGO OMG
Is it weird that I've always wanted to EAT scab blood?
Omg the cat eye
Ooooooh fuck I love this
This is gonna be my everyday make up
I just found you, your amazing!!!
I'm not allowed to have fake blood at school
It looks like double eyelid surgery

lmao
BAHAHAHHAAH AMAZING
2018 squad?
You should do a unicorn
2014?
Can't wait to do th- *hooded eyes* Oh.
Mykie i love this so much holy fuck. And the illusion is so perfect bc when you blink, the eyelid and skin around the cut moves so it looks hella creepy :)))
This is what your eye feels like after having to redo your eye liner 10 times
It’s so funny how ur like click here for this video but those never work lmfao
❤❤😊🗡
Okay so people are making this joke about “this is what it feels like when you’re trying to do you eyeliner 10 times” or something like that. i’m wondering who is it originally from though?
I am so trying this for Halloween
What if you don't have a crease?
Gosh I've been here for 4 years if not more. BTW anyone watching this is 2018
I love puns lol 😂
Cool
I love you and your vids you rock x

Where can I get scab blood
You are amazing, silly, and adorable. I️ love your videos
"Were not going for a beauty look here." Oh okay. Then explain why it looks like a drop dead gorgeous new eye crease trend, you beautiful creature you.
Can I just use strawberry jelly if i don't have scab blood
i love you
“we’re not going for pretty here” still looks gorgeous
When you keep messing up your cut crease you end up actually doing a cut crease lmao
Lmao I thought the intro music was my stomach lol

This is amazing
You can click where?
BEN NYE THE SCAB BLOOD!!!!!!!!
my school doesn't allow costumes on halloween so I'm doing this (:
Kinda wore this to a family event by accident, need to work on my time management. BUT its a surprisingly wearable look.
Nice

I know you didn’t use tape for the eyeliner thanks for fucking us who can’t wing eyeliner to do this look jerk
This is my everyday make up look now. Yes I'm that kid.
I can't even do my make up or eyeliner well I can't even do this Imma just cry while watching this

Glam meets gore.
What can I use if i dont have the scab blood??
I had a teacher make me take off my normal makeup on Halloween 😞
This is what happens when I try to do my  makeup
Honestly I would prob actually do that in real life 😂
How can you make scab blood? I can't find it anywhere! -_-
im gonna do that for my prom :)
Haha I have a scare following that exact line in real life on my right eye😂
I have watched EVERY gore video on your glam and gore channel and you ALWAYS use that scab blood
this is the definition of what glam and gore is❤😂
Well, sadly, cut creases and my eyelid are no friends
As of today this was posted 1,000  days ago.
ben nye the makeup guy
*hands award*
Where did you get ur palette knives? Glam&Gore
You should so do a ouija sfx tutorial!! There are a lot of examples on pinterest! PLEASE DO ONE! (If you arent too uncomfortable with it, i know some people are skittish with those types of things)
You: "Dont be scared" Me: "Don't be scarred...."
I wanted to do this then I saw her do it and just now crap
Please warn people not to eat mashed potatoes or anything when watching you're videos..
What's something that I can use instead of a small palette knife? Pls help meh
How long does a skab blood jar last?🤔
I will finally wear make up but, only this~ Last day of school, watch out! GG is coming with a "Cut" crease!
Juicay
I'd recommend eyeliner because it stays <3

Fetus Mykie sounds so cute
As soon as she said 'here' and pointed up I got a text 😂😂😂😂😂
BEN NYE THE SCAB BLOOD GUY BEN BEN BEN BEN!
How is mykie so perfect
I had a teacher who's son was punched in the eye and got a cut on their eyelid.
Don't be scurred
This is why I love her videos *CUT CREASE*
I am so tempted just to wear this to school
Absolutely my favorite tutorial ever
One time I got 100% acetone in my eyeball
okay but when Mykie looks up it looks kinda pretty 😂
Can you do a full cut look like with the cut crease and more like cut smile
has anyone gone back to the start because e..HALLOWEEN
I actually did cut my eyelid
SAME
I have a green turbie!!
You my dear....deserve an award
Am I the only one just kinda vegging out and watching all of her videos? Yes.. Okay..
please do more videos like this. ya know like glam with a little easy SFX. LOVE YOU. 💖
do you know how to make reusable prosthetics?
2:42 Panic! At The Mykie
Obviously the alcohol paints arnt eye safe, but is the scab blood eye safe?
any tips on how to make this last throughout the day ???
an excuse for this "My date didn't like me "😊
When ur Asian and you dont have a crease line.    ._.
Ben Nye scab blood is basically tiny crushed gelatin and gel food colouring. I might try it
Ben nye the scab blood guy
Lol that's gonna be me when I get double eyelid surgery.
How it feels when ur glasses get pushed into ur face because u got hit
The puns never end
Oh come on, you look pretty even when you're trying to look gross lol
LMAO the imagination she has a gold
I love how she isn't those basic you tubers that act all cute/innocent or dress up for the camera. I love you're work Mykie!!
I thought in the thumb nail that it said cult crease 😂
Love this look so cool
Don't be scrd
this is what asians see normally when they get double eyelid surgery lol
xD cool!
can you do Snapchat filters but scary and gory
Your brows are 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
she looks like hayley williams in paramore
do you have any brothers or sisters and if so who are they
I'm really upset now because I really want to do this but my mother is very against makeup *In any form* and anything that she think might lead me down the dark road *Too late* and would never allow me to get the scab blood. Any tips for replacements or ways to make it yourself? It would be great if you did but I understand if you don't. By the way love your videos so far, I'm a new subbie and I'm addicted <3
How it feels after the fiftieth attempt at doing a crease shade
Is she a lefty or a righty and if she is a lefty high five girl!
what camera does she use?
how are you soooooo hot😊😊😊😊😊
Wore this on Valentine's Day 😘
"SKURRED"
Or you could be a dumbass like myself and get a long scar over your eyelid by getting hit in the face with a basketball, causing your glasses to become embedded in your face!
Ben Nye the scab blood guy
I had a really cut lije that when i fell off a trampoline into a shed window.
so how do u come up with all this stuff
Am I the only one who wants to eat the scab blood
Can you please do a tutorial on a regular glam cut crease? I just can't seem to get it :(
am i the only one who would wear this everyday to school?
when your eyeliner can literally cut someone
Where the heck do I get this stuff?😂
If I wasn't allowed to wear a costume to school, I would just say that I put red eyeliner and eyeshadow and it just smudged.
Is there a way of making scab blood?
What is a good alternative to alcohol activated paints that give the same or similar effect? 🤔
Can you do a tutorial on how to make it look like your mouth is sown close
Glam&Gore you are one of my biggest inspirations I am a self-learning makeup artist and I want to be like you!! If you commented on my comment I'd be so happy! And if you watched one of my vids I'd cry!
I think I found my graduation make up
This is what your eye fells like after having to redo your eyeliner 10 times
I'm ADDICTED to your videos they're AMAZING you're amazing  and BEAUTIFUL what is life ??
it's the middle of April and I'm ab to wear this to school BC I can't wear FX makeup
You earned a sub. You are so funny and you don't go to fast like other tutorials.
I don't think I've missed ANY of your videos... I'm obsessed 😍😍
i would wear this on an everyday basis if i had the products and effort
Poor Asians..
Mykie should be on strange addictions for her addiction to scab blood:)
ugh is there anyway I can do It without the gore?
is it just me that thinks that song in the background was saying "real cut crease"
As her camera dropped I was literally trying to catch my phone
Grossly beautiful.
Where can you get The scab blood and how much does it cost ?
This is completely random, but is Mykie a natural redhead? I've been wondering foreva
Glam and Gore, you always have the perfect ideas for Halloween. I'm gonna say thank you for that.
omg so cool im a girl
Haha she got it in her eyelash
HOW ARE YOU SO ORIGINAL?!!!!
I just watch her videos but never do the vids
scab blood=blood that has thickened?
I love you so much. You're literally one of my favorite YouTubers
How could I turn a runny blood into a thicker blood for this look? (It was a cheap kind)
That  actually looks really pretty omg I would wear that in public😂
every time she said Ben Nye I thought of Bill Nye the science guy
Where can I get scab blood
Oh wait that's eyeliner problems 😂
How it feels when you do your crease so many times
I did this for Halloween at school and I still got sent home for "being distracting".
My mom walked in on me when you said "cuz it's awesome and joosay"...... Awkward.....
How does she get the palette knives?
I'm in actual love with how you did your eyebrows 😍😍😍
people made a meme of this 😒
😀😀😀😀😀😵😵
When you have to do your eyeliner over again too many times
my new favorite channel, I've binge watching for 3 hours non stop. loving  the videos
Cx I can't stop laughing omg
just subbed!! I love your videos even though Ive only watched a few of them!! 😀
how do you do this look if you have a hooded eyes, because I'd really like to but I have hooded eyes.
i love your music choices omg
why do this when you can just fail your eyeliner twenty times?
What it feels like when you keep messing up your eyeshadow and have to keep taking it off.
your lashes are named after me !! <3
i love you glam gore
"We're not going for pretty here" and yet still she manages to make it look absolutely beautiful... ;)
You should go to the shop like that
this is an awesome idea!
i just wanna ask a lil questionnnn! where u get ur latex or scab blood or all fo ur stuufff (palette knife ecc) mikey?
Thanks for this
where do you get your pallet knifes from?!?
I went to the mall after doing this and the joker mouth cause i was hungry and needed donuts right away cause priorities right? and I was there for about 1-2 hours being stopped for photos by people, even a police man stopped for a photo. Then I got my donuts and the guy gave me an extra free one cause i looked fab. BEST DAY EVER!
I <3 your gore videooooz
do you have a job in fx makeup? or do you just do it for YouTube?
I have a question Mykie. Where can I buy Ben Nyle's Scab Blood?
Does anyone have any easy idea on how to do this without scab blood, but get a similar result?
Did she change the name of this video?
I tag you in a pic on Instagram and yep. Now ever since you did open cuts and gore I fell in love. Now I need more scab blood lol😂(love you btw)
So cool
She reminds me of Kenzi from lost girl because their voices are so similar
IM DOING THIS NEXT FRIDAY ALONG WITH BRUISING MY CHEAK IM SO EXCITED
If you don't got scab blood what else can you use ? Or is their a diy on scarb blood? 🙈
I just can't get over the fact that somebody successfully patented a product called "scab blood"
every time you post a video & someone has my phone , no matter where we are , I yell "Give me my phone , Give m my phone" & they completely stare like I'm crazy & I'm okay with that lol
i love you your awsome intelligent and just omg i dont know how to eplain you in words ur to awsome ur my fav youtuber

Almost been a year since this uploaded <3
"How you can dress up for halloween without getting kicked out of school." lol nope

I put it on my ENTIRE BODY it took 3 hours
You should make a video on "everything you'll need to start doing fx makeup!" Cuz I really want to start because of you and I know some things I should get but a video from you would help a lot!💘
Is she Sarah from pretty little liars?
I love you so much and I want more videos!
You have a towel on your head
I know you probably won't see this because of how old this video is. but does this look last all day? I kind of want to wear it to school on Halloween but I don't know if thescab blood will smudge or anything. if anybody knows I would love to hear from you. love your videos btw xD
Vhchcrv

OMG!! Can you do my Halloween makeup? this is amazing!
Where do you get your SFX makeup?
Oh no we almost saw zomboobies
i did this while babysitting some kids, i used strawberry jelly instead of scab blood ((bc i left all my stuff at home)) it was pretty cool
I would wear this to work! That is if I didn't work at a High School! XD
I'm rewatching most of your videos and it's almost 4:30 am now xD I love your tutorials and will definitely try one for Halloween. Or just any day of the year c:

New Subscriber.
Oh so this was the time you of  box died your hair.  At least it's fixed now.  From Pubes to Paradise.  I'm addicted to both of your guy's channels of you couldn't already tell.
Hi am new to the fx world and I would love for you to do something with beetle juice or the make up of beetle juice because I wanna do beetle juice  for Halloween I said beetle juice three times lol so if you could make it happen I would love to recreate it 😝

I love the new video! 👍🏻❤️👌🏻

Hey I want to try to do fx makeup like this but have no idea what kind of materials to buy or where to get it from. I have just been using makeup and makeup brushes that I have but would like to get more. Would you mind doing a vidio on all of your supplies for me? Thanks and by the way I really love your makeup and would one day like to be a pro makeup artist and freak people out with all sorts of gory costumes!!
Hi Mykie! I am a HUGGEEE fan of yours, and have been following your tutorials. The only thing I need help with is finding a palette knife... do you think you can quickly help me out? Thank you so much!!! <3
I'm totally doing this at school
I am always trying to find these green glitters in her hair😂
Who ever thinks this is fake there life is this channel is the best channel i discovered

I also think I will be using this look in my short film also. :)
'really simple, really easy' *still manages to fuck it up*

"double eyelid surgery"
I am new at this and I keep watching these and I cant find none of the stuff like liquid latex blood pallets etc but I love this one its easy
I'm going to wear this look out just for the hell of it.
Hey Mykie, Im really into Sfax makeup and I want to be a professional artist when I'm older. I love your videos and I've uploaded two time lapses on my channel. I'm uploading another on Saturday and I would be sooooooo happy if you checked them out.!!! 😘🙈🙉🙊 Phoebe, 12
I know how to do a cut crease (you cut your crease) lol

Would this work in the hollows of the cheeks?
The fact that you are self taught is so amazing. You and your skills are better than most people that have gone to school for it all. You are absolutely amazing Mykie!!! <3
Well you did a good job because in step 3 i almost puked with the dang scab blood Yay!!!!

Since my school won't let us wear costumes I'm doing this instead
Could you do a unzipped face tutorial? Please!
Badass! I'm totally going to try this out!
I would love to see a foundation routine from you. We're approximately the same skin tone and I live in a country where most people aren't only a shade warmer than milk (which would be me) fair makeup is pretty hard to find and just can't seem to find anything that perfectly matches my super hella white face. Everything is too yellow or too warm or too ...just wrong *add frustrated noises here* You seem to kind of have mastered it. I demand to know all of your secrets.
Yaassss I finally watched it! That is a hell of a lot easier than I thought.
OH MY GAWD!!! Why did i bearly discover you ?!!!! Im addicted to your videos now. You've now got yourself a new subbie <3 Youre so beautiful <3
