Every time I watch this I'm amazed he is not wearing gloves.  I have yet to meet a spray bottle that does not leak onto my hand.
Call me a nanny but I'd be wearing a mask spraying that.
Can I order it from online?
why not girdle the tree instead?
Does this killer impact other trees through the soil or entangled root systems?
Does this work on very large trees
Will Glyphosate do the same job? It’s an easier herbicide to find in Canada. I’m having a hard time finding imazapyr.
Tap copper nails spaced about 4” apart around the trunk. Dead in a year. Leave the nails exposed in case someone with a chainsaw wants to cut it down.
This doesn’t work at all
Can u show us how to eliminate bamboo?
We should be planting for trees you bloody fool annoys me so much people cutting trees down they haven’t got a clue what they’re bloody doing completing utter idiots❤
Tried it. Worked pretty dam good. Also used a drill. But hatchet is easy.
Happy fun music during what basically amounts for Auschwitz for these trees is quite the juxtaposition.
why not use a chainsaw?
That's some dangerous liquid you're holding, with one squirt and tree is deayyed.
I did this to a tree some years ago. But I drilled a hole and filled it with neat herbicide 😁
What is the best time to do this please, autumn or spring?
CUST AND USE VINEGAR OR GAS.  DON'T NEED HERBICIDES OR EXPENSIVE ANY THING
Just curious.  Would that kill stumps?
Cool
Very effective
Bro really said omiwa mo shindeiru 😂
Wonder if it would kill choke cherry trees ?
That isa a beautiful wooded area.  Not too dense.
This guy's a tree murderer. Good Lowered!
I drill and inject MSM60 paste made with water about the viscosity of paint  , a 1/8- 3/16 hole and 0.1 gram or so with an ag needle syringe from a farm store. Drill an angled hole or two.  Works on many species but not all and not poison ivy. Does work with winter creeper.
You don't have to use chemicals. Just strip about a foot of bark around tree in late winter. Nutrients will rise up tree in spring, causing leaves to grow but tree will soon die because Nutrients cannot go back down to roots. A little more work, but great to know you didn't spray chemicals all over your land. Don't go the lazy route.
Finally, a true "hack" that might work !
How do you go about getting the poison your talking about to kill the trees??
What did he spray on it?
What brand/s do you guys recommend? Thank you.
He is using arsenal herbicide, it’s not even available to the general public.
At ones dayud. At's gone dah. 😝
For those that couldn't hear what he said, the herbicide he used is called "Arsenal", which he diluted 20% to 80% water.
What is in this solution ? I’m from the U.K. , just wondered if I can also use this method
Thank you. I have trees over taking mine n my neighbours gardens!
What is the name of the product you use
What is the name of the chemicle
Good video but what is the mixture you used?
You are evil, karma is a bitch that has your number.
Chemical name sir
The most dangerous creature of earth... The human...  And l also own my land... (This is for the kind information for some people in the comment section who are saying like "We not just bought the land, we bought the lives of all the creatures living there with the land... so we have full authority to kill them or destroy their home..." right...?) 'We own a land' doesn't mean that it has given us any right or authority to destroy the lives of the creatures living there... And I am also a farmer... belongs from the Konkan region (Maharashtra, India). Do you The Western ghats(Sahyadri mountain ranges) is one of the UNESCO's World Biodiversity Hotspots... And we do sustainable farming here without damaging the ecosystem...

Hi what is the liquid call again ?
You can't fool us George W. Bush
Thank you. I appreciate the video and I believe the chemical he is using to kill the young trees is effective. My question is how close to desirable trees can you work with this chemical before it harms desirable trees?  I've got young oaks that are crowding mature oaks that I wouldn't dream of harming.
Does this work with invasive bushes?
Name of herbicide?
what herbicade you use?
What’s the mixture
My 2024 application did not work.  Ash is everywhere--including the septic & neighbor's.  Meanwhile, my "garden" is crapola.  Spent a great deal of time w/ 20% solution of CuSO4.  Cut 2 sides w/ barbie chainsaw.  Squirted copious amounts w/ soap bottle.    Some tops went unhappy.  Febu-ugly produced buds like all other trees.  5 trees of 1k lost chlorophyll for a few wks in April.  5May2025 they are all yet mocking me.  Will finish the girdle on the other 2 sides as soon as i quit worrying about planting a shady garden...   AAArgh!

Mulberry  trees suck
I had a neighbor who had a garbage tree growing up the backside of my fence so I drill about a dozen little holes into it, just deep enough to get past the bark bout a quarter inch deep and just kept spraying them with roundup and by the following year it was dead
Trees are essential and you shouldn’t be killing them.
Thanks alot...finaly i can secretly get rid of my neighbors trees that keeps casting Shadows onto my solar panels😂
Drilled 1/2 inch holes in a bunch of smaller trees then filled the holes with 2 different herbicides. Didn't hurt any of them. After 3 years now, those trees are.still growing.
The Arsenal Herbicide is about 50  to 200 dollars, so a little more than pennies.
Girdling kills any tree
After the tree is poisoned and it dies is it ever safe to burn once it's chopped down how do you ultimately get rid of it then?
Is this useful for Callery pear?
Anung klasing gamitin yan
Here's what worries me. From their website - Foliage treatments will provide pre-emergent control as the active material is released to the soil following plant decay. So those rotting leaves and roots are releasing herbicide into the soil.
Thanks for this video it’s been used by Australians to go around killing trees blocking the view from their porch. And no they didn’t have permission to remove trees.
Muslims are taught in the quran by their prophet Mohammed to hate and terminate Jews ( October 7 attack ) and Christians, ( September 11 attack ) and other no religions, even gays, Surah 9:29 and surah 98:6 Muslims shouldn't be allowed to have a government in any country because of their hate beliefs. Their belief is to physically terminate gays, Hindus, Buddhist and anyone who leaves Islamic religion. Islam is satanic, you need to accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior and God, And you and nation will have true peace. Also their prophet Mohammed  is a child molester. he has sex with a 9 year old girl and he and his followers thought it was ok, very sick people.,, the Mayor of deerborn Michigan was so disrespectful to Biden and Trump because the mayor doesn't care about America because he is a Muslim.

What is in the spray bottle?
0:50 'we' (?) idiot  uses criminal plural. In general video and coments qualifies as unhealthy  documentary list for  next cleaning mechanism.
It's amazing that all of the eons of the forests being around, not once was an herbicide needed to help the forest floor flourish.  What is needed, is mycorrhizal fungi that is well established.  The large trees that can reach sunlight, transfer their energy into the mycorrhizal fungi, which transfers some of that energy into the forest floor.  This video is NOT what you do to help the forest flourish.  It is what you do when you want to irradicate junk trees like chinese privet.

I want to do this in the darkness of the night to my neighbors cedar tree. I get death allergies all over my property, can't even rake the lawn without dieing the next few days. It's only when it pollinates but lasts almost forevor in the ground and dust. Will this leave a black mark or any murder evidence if I do it besides the cut? Can I do it on a branch?
oo
Uric acid or kerosene also effective

Just cut out a strip of bark all around?
This doesn't work
I have a tenacious tree threatening my Septic Drain Pipe...cutting does virtually nothing.
If you kill hickory and oak you want have any hard wood lumber and not only that hickory and oak trees are the best firewood.and if you kill the oaks you want have any acorns for the wild animals to squirrels, rabbits ,deer,elk, moose, other types of deer and turkeys.sounds like a very stupid wasteful idea. Folks don't fall for this distructive stunt.anybody should have better sinse.how can you justify this, it's crazy.
Will it eventually cause the tree to fall down ?
Anyone here know about paper mulberry trees?   Huge ones in the preserve across the street (residential area) have invaded my yard thru the roots.   Retail herbicides kill the leaves but not the runners.   I've used the method of chopping and adding epsom salt for other small trees but nothing fazes the invasive mulberry
I live in the Sahara desert and I can tell you this method works perfectly!

Glad to hear this. I have sweet gum all over my north side. Just learned they inhibit a vegetable garden. All that failure was making me feel inadequate! They gotta die! I can’t afford to have them removed. I’m a 92 pound 72 yo woman. You KNOW I’m following these instructions! 💛 (update: tried it. Big gums. Didn’t work. My fault, I’m sure. Too big? Not deep enough cuts? 🤷🏻‍♀️ Gonna try girdling.)

the only nuisance  are the mindless idiots that have zero respect for our trees  ,trees breath out what we breath in.
Will this kill Privet trees?
What is the name of that little hatchet your using
If you are older than 55, you should not make any plans for what will grow there in the future, because your time will soon be up and you probably won't have enough time to grow and plant your dream tree.
very stupid advice, there is never a need for killing/removing small trees. I owe my own forest and leave it alone. Sometimes storms make room for new trees and shrubs. Do you not know that roots of all kinds of different tree species are connected via mycorrhiza and help each other to grow?
Will this kill my Leyland Cypress tree I want gone?
Sweet gum trees are really good carving wood.
Go listen to The Trees by Rush. Great song… seems appropriate here.

Eye protection and gloves?
Plz naam this product sir
Has anyone (besides the video creator) tried this single cut technique on buckthorn? My understanding (like apparently others) was that I needed to go all around the tree to apply the triclopyr, not a single cut.  But perhaps this girdling all the way around is only for those not using herbicide?
I don’t want to use round up, will copper sulphate work too?
My family have had issues with our neighbour for decades. My parents asked him to trim their trees because it's shading out our garden. They laughed and said it was intentional to mess with the neighbour who originally owned our house because they were feuding. They kept the trees up for us, despite us never having issues with them. When I was born they even got a dog and started training it to bark at night to keep me awake.  I'm now in my late 20s, the original neighbour died, but the son who trained the dog is still alive and living there. His back garden is filled with huge trees: sycamore, ash, holly and cherry laurel. The holly and cherry laurel are huge and are blocking out the light in our backyard making it full shade.  Our neighbours house is falling apart, tiles have come off the roof and he doesn't fix it or pay someone to fix it. He crams newspaper into the gaps between his tiles. His garden is in complete disrepair, infested with weeds such as Thistles and Pendulous Sedge... My dad is elderly and is fed up with the trees shading out his garden. That is what brought me here.
Ur SO RIGHT the people who dont own thier land & think its ok to let the trees take over. I love trees, but they spread, take over,& kill my bushes,& flowers. Also some roots can get in the foundation of Ur house, then Ur in trouble. The people that are negative about this,  GO TO GOOGLE,& STUDY THIS

Protecting trees is essential for maintaining the health of our planet and ensuring a sustainable future. Trees play a crucial role in absorbing carbon dioxide, a major greenhouse gas, and releasing oxygen, which is vital for all living beings. They also provide habitats for countless species, help to regulate climate, prevent soil erosion, and support the water cycle. By not killing trees, we preserve biodiversity, protect ecosystems, and contribute to the fight against climate change. Additionally, trees offer aesthetic beauty and recreational spaces, enriching our lives and the environment. Therefore, it is our responsibility to conserve and protect them for future generations.

Thank you so much for sharing your knowledge 🙏🙏🤗🙏
Fuck hunters
Wish I knew the exact brand he used.
This is a great idea. I have an area in the woods with solar panels and needs to be clear lots of pine trees and other trees are taking over the area. This is a great idea!
He says 20% Arsenal Herbicide (Imazapyr) with 80% water mixed in a spray bottle, for those that can’t hear him well. Search for it on Google.
Arsenal Concentrate Herbicide and 80% water????? THIS IS GREAT. I have been looking every where for this video to kill a crepe myrtle that just will not die. Wish you would show the product so I get the right kind.
Sooo gonna try this on my neighbour’s tree. They won’t do anything with the tree limbs that are destroying my roof
I girdled two acacias growing not more than two feet from a wall.  They didn't even flinch in the next year.  What kind of herbicide is he using?  I want those two gone, I want to keep the one in the back.  Far west Texas here.  Help?
WHY would anyone want to KILL a TREE on a planet that is so polluted, overpopulated,  with raging wild fires due to climate change??!! Only EVIL people kill trees!
Oh the irony of this video!! when settlers first came to America there were endless stands of incredible trees for the eyes to behold .. miles and miles of old growth forest's  all managed by nature ..Google Tom Wessels

Dont listen to ignorant people that neither owned a land or a house. I have a problem with a tree tearing into my sewer line that will cost 30k to replace if i dont take care of the tree root that i didnt plant. The city planted this tree and didnt care about long term issue. Typical idiotic city planners.
Don't you need a glove?

CALIFORNIA SLASH AND SPRAY AGENDA KILLS MILLIONS OF ACRES OF TREES. THEY LEAVE THEM DEAD ALL DRIED UP AND STILL STANDING. THEY SAY IT IS OKAY. BECAUSE THEY DO NOT BURN ANY FASTER THAN GREEN HEALTHY TREES THAT ARE ALIVE AND THRIVING. THIS IS HOW THEY HAVE ZERO FOREST FIRES IN CALIFORNIA. LOVE DEMONRAT POLITICIANS.
This channel don't answer.
the ashwagandha root is fabled in tibet for being a super herb... it is known as ginseng in china... it is apparently same as turmeric a known super food
obtaining tree clippings and root cuttings are important to understand produce of your garden
dpt practical sciences
If you read the label for Arsenal, PPE includes a long-sleaved shirt and chemical resistant gloves made of any waterproof material. If it gets on your skin, you are supposed to rinse immediately for a duration of 15-20 minutes. Modeling appropriate PPE is important.
More than one old timer told me that using diesel would do the trick too.
This is definitely less labor intensive than hot coals on a stump.
What time of year do you do this?
Will  glyphosate do the job instead of arsenal ?

Next year I’m going to have nice ocean view🤣🤣🤣
Dats gone die!. Me inside 😮
Lies. Never use pesticides. Ever. Just a chainsaw. Stump sprouts are ok for wildlife. The remaining large specimen trees will do their jobs as they get bigger will outcompete and stump sprouts
Dont kill
What do you use to kill a MULBERRY TREE?  The roots are huge and all over under ground of my garden.  Thank you.
I have a huge  Ash tree that I would like to remove. It has a very thick trunk and is somewhere between 60-80 feet tall. Will this stuff kill a tree this big? If so, what product are you using. I have been seeing Tordon videos but  haven't seen anyone killing such a large tree  yet. If this stuff will work, what is the application method?
will this kill very large trees?
I couldn’t understand what he said was in the spray bottle.

This guy is a killing machine.can takeout a whole forest in an hour almost effortlessly
Some trees will die any way , making a choice of keeping the better trees will make better trees , better woods , and better logs some day in the future .
Seems terrible to do this to native vegetation. Clicked because I thought you would be doing this to Tree of heaven or something.👎🏻

Can't u use hickory for furniture?
horrifying, how easy it is to poison a tree…😔😔
What Herbicide do you use???
Is there a treatment that works - such as vinegar or salt - that wouldn't leave poison behind in the wood to poison the ground as it decomposes?
Nah ! I  think you're barking up the wrong tree dude.
I wonder if this would work on red thorn trees. I've had them cleared out twice with dozer in pasture. They keep coming back from the roots left in ground.
Been pouring caustic soda and bleach over a tree after I removed some bark. It made no difference. I was doing it daily for over a month.
I've tried this several times and it didn't work on sweet gum trees.
The Hickory has beautiful yellow fall foliage. Absolutely stunning sir! Might should have left that one?
I completely girdled a Bradford pear and sprayed herbicide generously. That was over a month ago, and it is still green and healthy.
What is the product used.? Please.
I prefer a chain saw
This is bad thing why are you killing tree tree is giving oxygen for for survive but you are killing tree this is the bad video ever everyone comment this is bad this is bad ❤❤video
Lazy way to prevention
So, a silly question: HOW DO I GET RID OF ENGLISH IVY FOR ONCE AND FOR ALL??? I hate that stuff.
Yes! I would just cut them down job over.Then all the sunlight for your oaks.👍🌄🌳🍀☘🌱🌳🌻🌼
What is it chemical in bottle?
Prune them at ground level! A chainsaw! 😀
What this mix spry bottle please guide me my English very weak please gude me
We just “girdle” them, if you cut out about a 6” of cambium the tree will be unable to transport nutrients to the top. No chemicals needed
Don't kill bees, we need them. Instead, help them, make sure they have water available, and protect them. They are hard working little critters, learn to love and respect them. Honey is their food.
Hickory is one of the best trees! Nuts for squirrels and makes the best smoke flavor.
The small trees are taking. Nutrients from the big ones?? Lol. This guy is half baked.
Why you dont just cut off
How to eradicate humans, Hack and squirt !!
Bs . I did that . Only works for small trees less than 3 inch trunk .  I used chain saw ring 1/4 inch deep . No go still alive
If you do this to the roots would it work?
What kind of the chemicals you used? Please name and where to buy this? Thanks
This will work quite well to kill a couple of invasive junk sapling trees that are basically on the property line that my neighbor won’t let me cut down. With this unsuspecting way, she’ll never know. 😂
So one could go around to nice walnut trees and do this, then a year later offer to remove the trees from peoples properties and keep the costly wood…hmmm
why isn't he carrying lol
So incredibly poisonous liquid and your using it without gloves.wow.
What kind of herbicide???  How much too?
TARGON SPRAY - don’t dilute it.
Seriously you did a video on how to kill a tree. Wonder how many butthole kids are going to see this a go run amok their neighborhood thinking its funny killing a bunch of trees. Not to mention the tree is a living organism. Just cut it down and get it over quickly with a chain saw. Be humane about it. Trees take a long time to die your way. Duh.
Thanks for the Advice, I am going to war on my Sweetgums, hate them with a passion.
Why not just cut them down with a chainsaw?
What’s the concentration of the Imazapyr you use?
Too bad that won’t work on mesquite.
ARSENAL Herbicide
Works like a charm!
Tree killer
Interesting, but I have to wonder, why not just cut them down? Wouldn't that be a lot quicker?
Sir what is the name of the medicine
Great video and demo. Please show on the screen the type of herbicide. It was hard for me to understand. Thank you very much.
Hammer in some copper nails and the tree wil DIE.
😂😂 I love this video. “ a popper right here 1hit it’s dead”
It's deaaaad...
See the mess in the back ground , that's what you'll get . smh .
Sorry, I didn't catch the ingredients used! 80% Water for sure but what was the real deal included?
why not just cut them down  🤷‍♂️
Can you kill a ten foot tree using this method to squirt concentrated 18% glysophate roundup?
You don't need to squirt. All you need to do is remove all the bark down to the cambian all the way around. Leave it. It will die all on its own.
so you work for the enemy who wants us dead. You're done.
Ether way you have to cut the tree down, I dont under stand why you wand tree to die slowly then you have to cut it down
What is the name of this medicine?
Sorry a don't like
Great video!! About how long does it take to kill the smaller trees shown here from the time they’re cut and sprayed?
Would this work for the very invasive and allergy causing trash known as honeysuckle?
Mr Watkins, please, what is the name of that chemical?
HOW DO YOU REVERSE THE PROCESS IF A MISTAKE HAS BEEN MADE SIR ????
Drill 10mm holes in tree and put root killer in them , dead in a few weeks , sorted
Where have you been all my life?  I can sure use this information, Thank you and God Bless you...
what a dickhead trees give you oxygen kill them all what you gonna breath you idiot stick?
Fantastic ,Which chemical is this Sir.
Bald eagles need those.
It’s easier & sure cutting them at once! Rather that using chemicals
I cut down a small willow tree once and sprayed the entire stump with several good squirts. Before long the stump was sending out new shoots. This did not work for me.
good on in laws too.
arsenal herbicide? Where do you buy it? Is it readily available? Any particular brand name?
No tree is unwanted,🌳🌲🌴🍁🍃 you don't kill trees you plant more you dimwits
Just ring bark or fell them them instead of using poisonous crap.
Would this process work on a large oak tree as well?  I’d imagine you would have to give it a few hack and sprays, compared to the ones demonstrated here.   I’m surprised at how little is needed to kill those trees. Amazing.
Can you put the chemicals used in text on the video.
this seems like the perfect way to solve my city's bradford pear problem
why not cut down the trees
What is the chemical name
I doubt it would work.
I will try your way to see if it works.
What is the name of that liquid? Pls advise
Sir the liquid name? 80% water and 20% what?
Will this effect trees close by ?
what is the name of the chemical?
What herbicide is being used?
Love the accent & results  Deyead trees... My city did Oak Savanna restoration recently nearby and I'm loving the light coming through and opening up views, not sure if they killed the trees before cutting them down, mostly Buckthorn had been filling in, big money for eradicating that
Why not cut those skinny trees like 4 feet then hack and spray them for faster sunlight coming in?
name of chemical please
That does not work on big trees what you suggest😊
Can someone name those chemicals please 🙏🙏
The most American Title I have ever read.
What is the chemical present in that spray?
I have a pretty good sized oak that I would like to kill because it is way too close to my house.
Which chemical you use
What spray you ?sir...
Before cutting the trees,  please think over ' Global Warming '  One fine day the earth will become desert....
Apparently you don’t have any friends that are Beekeepers. in the area. Tulip poplar is the best nectar producing tree out there other than Sourwood it’s a very desirable and very important tree to have
The stuff I was given is a navy blue. The guy who sold to me said tree is dead in a flash.   Does it sound right he works for the city council

Is your name Bobby Watkins or Bobby Wackins?  Should this technique be renamed "The Wackins Squirts" either way? - I vote yes.
Will arsenal herbicide kill pines
from where we can get that chemical which you are spraying, can you please someone provide link for diff chemicals
Hack and squirt! 😂
Wish I had your forest situation to attend to. Honey locust that I can’t cut until pulling the greenbrier enough to cut the lower branches to gain access
Great video.  Thanks for sharing.  Do you have a specific brand of arsenal herbicide that you would recommend?  Thank you.
We have a couple box elder's that need to go because we're being invaded severely by the bugs the last couple years. Can you recommend a product that's fairly cheap for a couple trees?

Dont spray chemicals, just cut it down you baby!
This is not American enough, thought I will see good ol' 50 BMG shot at trees..
Nature just does not need us to regulate itself.
Too lazy to cut them and use their wood?
Will this method work on camphor trees?
Pretty toxic shyt. I wonder what else died?
If you live where they have winters, just cut a 6 inch strip of bark all the way around trunk.
Thanks now nature doesn't stand a chance watch this be the next tik tok challenge
Good idea, kill trees.  Youre a fucktard
why use chemistry if you could just chop them in one hit
What's in the solution?
I don't think I'm going to dilute the poison, I'm going to use it 100% pure concentrated… I want to make sure that tree is dead!!!
Please reply the name of the chemical you are using as I am not understanding your fast accent. Thank you.
dont put these videos on youtube because people are doing it to neighbors trees
Squirting poison in the forest just doesn’t seem like a good “forestry management practice” to me.
How to get this medicine
This medicine name please
Grow them don't kill them... or move them jackasses.
Herbicides always suck.
I didn't understand, what he is spraying behind the bark...?
What is the solution u used.?
Can you do this method on honeysuckle
Drill and table salt. Drill downward at a 45° angle then fill it with salt
In my day we would just take some cans of camping fuel jelly and smear it on the trees and just burn the whole thing
hi what is the name of herbicid...? and how do you mixe it? can i find it in europe?
This guy should be Fauci’s replacement. Same policies!
I have tulip trees popping up everywhere, one next to my greenhouse, need to get rid of it, not sure how to do it, these trees are hard to get rid off. I even cut a brunch and put it upside down for support of other plant, now this brunch is growing too.
Which spray is he using? Anyone
poor trees out there still living in the wild west dying left and right
Squirt it in a cut, you're DADE!
Could they get someone who speaks English?
I think other thanks the tres will be de ath
Instead of putting chemicals in your yard. Y don't you just cut it down
I like this guy lol
One Small copper-nail, hammered into the root, will do the same Job. Without chemicals. But the fastest way; -use a Chainsaw…
That's my sex method hack and squirt!
Any way you could kill it without herbicide?  Assuming the tree later is colonised by fungi and organisms that may get contaminated ?
sir what is that herbicide ?
Yo i have the same exact hatchet. Half pound pocket hatchet
Chainsaw
What herbicide should I buy to achieve this? Any arsenal labeled products are expensive, would any of the brush killers work?
Sir, What is the chemical name.
Sorry what type of herbicide?
There’s no unwanted trees 🌳
This guys an idiot
Are they ok for firewood?
What is this poison that will kill these trees? What are the consequences?
What is the mixture in the squirt bottle ?
Do you think this would work with Sassafrass trees?  It seems many underground roots keep pushing up new growth....i tend to get something like 30 to 40 shoots from trees cut down a couple yrs ago.
We ring our trees we select for fire wood or just cleaning up the bush...... ring it in the summer n by following spring it's ready for bucking n splitting... standing fire wood .... 👍 No chems....
When I'm seventy I might try that.  Some of those trees previously known as junk wood are part of a cycle that when die out improve the Forrest soil and fertilize those more valuable trees.  Sugar makers now recognize Some Ash and Basswood trees help keep a sugar maple stand healthy.  The trees do all suck and are somewhat at war.  In gardening it's called thinning and yea it can create healthier trees.  Too much thinning can be counter productive.  It takes a knowledgeable person to choose what stays and what goes, and those decisions are not always correct. The people that know the most about trees are also the ones who have made the biggest mistakes, the Forrest service.  Now we have them to learn from.
Kill all the trees. Lord knows they just get in the way and look ugly. Stupid humans.
you are a evil person! one of the demons. go away. You are an anti-natural mindless know-nothing, when you do something you only make it worse, the world is better off without poisoners like you
So its kind of like a C V jab for trees....
Murderer!!!!
First off smaller trees don’t take from bigger ones they all share water and nutrients in what they can’t make up for sunlight the smaller trees he says would have never done anything is an untrue statement everytime I large tree dies or falls in a storm one of those smaller trees all of a sudden has all that space and light to grow in it’s gonna grow right up into the spot the old tree was in dog woods are excellent trees and I have planted thousands in CITY AREAS IN PARKING LOTS they are better than slow heavy oaks in a lot of cases but hey if you wanna chop down your trees so u can plant flowers u may is well clear cut it instead of poisoning everything I notice one thing about people whom poison plants and the land they live on it’s usually older people who don’t care they are about to die or nieve dorks who thinks poison is the best and only answer idk bout y’all but I’d jus cut the mf tree what’s the point is poisoning it the thing just won’t grow leaves u gone have to look at a ugly dead trunk and tree until u can cut it down so may is well save the time and money by cutting ts use your brains
Cut the tree down.  This is a slow death for a tree.
They should lock you up together with your herbicides
This is murder
How many squirts?
Unwanted Tree 🌳
Thank you sir
20% of what ?!?
What to use as the herbicide was very poorly explained need to be be better  don't mumble !
Use a 3/4 inch drill, drill 1" hole , squirt fill with round-up.  Bigger tree requires   more than 1 hole for quicker kill. Sthil,  Husqi  works well cause you're gonna use it anyhow!
At least wear some rubber gloves !
What is the name of the poison that you use
Can you do a video on the hack & squirt method to make a dead tree live again?
Cut all the trees and let’s all just live on a golf coarse.  Europeans have ruined the forests of the New World.  Let’s destroy the earth’s shade canopy and wi dear why we are swing droughts and warming of the face of the earth.
I use that same hack and squirt with the ladies! loll
Hi helloo what insid   botel  Ingrid yan
I wand.  Canyou help
Americans love their herbicides. But worst advise I ever heard. Try a saw!
why would you do that
What is that liquid in a spray can. Where can I purchase it.
Thanks! Been taking out our mature ash ,aspen ,birch and bass.  Leaving mature oak and elm.
You don't need to use arsenic.  A little round-up will do.  You just need to expose the inner bark, and squirt it.
Like to see results?
Just use a chainsaw
Why would you want to kill a tree?
Glad I wasn’t born in a tree.
What is the name of the insecticide you used with water?
Will this work on Black locus trees ? Aka, thorn trees?
Old people and their roundup.. let's toxify the ground for future generations!! Ever heard of a chainsaw???
Where can I buy the chemical thank you
What’s in the spay chemical make up Salk?
What's the name  & where can you get the chemical spray  ?
You should not kill popular trees, the eat a ton of carbon dioxide.
I thought hack and squirt was a lung and bowel disorder.
When taking Viagra goes wrong
What is that solution in the bottle you are spraying sir?
Someone Is Coming On My Property At Night And Doing Things To Kiii Them, The Police Cant Catch Them. I Love My Trees. And This Is Criminal.
If you didn't catch the name of the herbicide that Mr. Watkins is using in the video it is called ARSENAL HERBICIDE.  An arsenal herbicide contains IMAZAPYR.  Look for it at any home any garden store, any brand will do.  Remember to dilute it to 20% Imazapyr if the product you buy is not already diluted.
Thanks for the good advice.  This is MUCH easier than what I have been doing in the past which cutting the bark all around the circumference of the tree down to the hardwood.  I'm going to use this method from now on (except I'm going to wear rubber gloves when I am handling the chemical spray).
Didn't work well with ironwood or hophorn even with flocking 360 degrees.
Chainsaw or…girdle them
what kind of herbicide?
All you had to do was gurdle  the tree. Cut a 2" strip around the trunk. It will die  no chemicals.
Pls let me know that what was sprayed (injected) on the tree to kill it ???
20% wut?
Seriously we need sunlight if a tree is big enought to destroy a building it's better be cut and also if they allow trimming it would help both to survive. PPL are so mad stopping normal people trying to save trees and dogs that they forget the harm aspect of it. If you have balls stop big corporations from cutting jungles. Naah that they cannot. But only can screw some citizens life. Anyways kill slowly tress that do not let you take in sunlight and can ruin the building/ house. Or keep trimming them from the beginning
What is the combination of that liquid?
I wonder if this would work on mesquite trees?
Will it kill those terrible invasive gift from heaven trees?
What chemical are you using?
What is the name of that herbicide?
I am sorry,  but what is the name of the herbicide.
When he says dead. What happens 6 months later? Does the bark fall eventually?
What about a very large tree.  Doubt this method will kill them.
All you have to do to kill a tree is debark it two inches around.. it’s how old farm’s did back in the day.. I had a huge pine tree near my house it was dead in a week..
There is absolutely no way that tiny cut and herbacide do anything at all.
91% alcohol is what I used today. I hacked this seedling down and it was taller than 5 feet tall. I lobbed off everything and put 91% alcohol on it. It's dead..
Don't kill them dummy. You can sell,replant, or donate these shade providers. Think man.
But hickory trees produce nuts...
*It's 2022 my boi 😬 you will get cancel lol if they see you*
Murder just call some one to haul it off
What is the active ingredient in the spray, and where can you get it?
Exactly what is the liquid that you are using.
Which chemical used please reply me
Why not just cut them down
I'm going to do my neighbor's tree like that. It shades my pool
Medicine name please
6 years later first time seeing August 29 2022
Medicine name
We literally have climate change and cutting it down releases carbon dioxide
What chemical are you using?
Tree slayer. I just cut them down and utilize them.
We have so many invasive cherry laurels over taking our pecan trees it is crazy. Thanks
Where can I find a small bottle of this stuff?
Good job 👍  What kind of herbicide / chemical are you using ?
Iam kerala india
Please name the cemical
please tell me the name of the elements of solution.  80% water 20% what??
Which chemical is this ??
Give someone what product has the strongest Arsenal herbicide and cheapest Arsenal ac or whatever is 400.00 a bottle, fixed income  ;-(
Where can I buy the chemical?
No No, Get away from trees because they can kill you with deadly gas if you disturb them.
Okay, I give up. What's in the sprayer.
will this method work on pines also?
What is the mixture of spray
Hey, I´m German and didn´t understand what Spray mixture you use. Pls. can anybody write it down for me ? Best Rgds ...
Silly question but what does that liquid consist of besides water you don't say?
Dont it work on big trees
Chemical name
What is the chemical name
Where do you get arsenic chemical coz I want to get rid of unwanted trees in my coffee plantation which is shadegrown and there are excess number of trees in certain blocks which I need to get rid of.
Chemical name please?
What is 20%? I'm german and i didnt understud what he sad!
Never would’ve thought a hickory tree would be thought of as undesirable.
no tree is unwanted !!!!!!!!!!!!!
Coulda explained the contents of that spray bottle a lot better, still dont understand his description. He just blew thru it.......idiot.
all that standing dead wood - do you not worry about forest fires? Or do you cut them out and utilize for firewood etc?
sadly i couldn`t find this stuff in german stores
What are the specifics about this method?.  Solution recipe? How long does it take for the tree to die?  You still have to cut it down tho. I have swamp maples and other weed trees grow in a part of my yard.   can’t pull them up even when small. Worried about poisoning other wildlife tho.
Fell them. Works every time, and you don't wind up with a bunch of widow makers. If you killit you need to drop it anyway.
only you can prevent the forest. thanks a lot.
überall komt gift hin lalalalala überall komt gift hin lalalalaalal udn utter natur gibts nciht mehr lalalalalalalalalalaa
Why you just dont cut them down instead of using chemicals?
So I had a Bradford Pear tree cut down and stump grinded but, some of the underground roots remain and are constantly pushing up new chutes. So I don't have to painstakingly dig up the remaining roots, can I just expose any part of the root and do the same thing?
What is the first ingredient??? I cannot hear it well. From where we can findit/buy it? Arsenal herbicide? What kind/ brand?
What are the active ingrediants of that herbicide?
I can literally see the landscape dying by the pixels.
Appreciate your input! I have many, what I consider, 'trash' trees. I only have one acre lots of trash trees. I look forward to implementing your suggestion.
I girdled a large green ash around 6 years ago and let it stand.  Bark starting to fall off now.  Lots of birds use the dead tree, which is next to water.  The other day, the tree had many dozens of swallows on it.  They seem to bring their young there to perch, then feed them bugs they nab over the water.  I suppose that eventually the young are coaxed to find their own meals
One hit and squirt and its dead. Proceeds to hit and squirt some more on same tree.
I love all kinds of trees
The trouble is that the authorities are doing this so they can save the costs of maintaining trees and spend it on chief excutives' bonus.
yo i bet those trees scream whenever they see this guy.......like you killed their son lol
Lazy and disgusting
whatever hes spraying gives you terminal cancer and we love it, dont we folks?
o.O?????????? why not just cut the tree down? you make a small cut on it squirt some piss on it??? why not just cut it down instead of waiting for it to die?
Chain and saw.
BS I’ve drilled holes and soaked them in salt and motor oil and trees have still grown back
*How dare you!*
Maybe just buy a chainsaw and take care of it in about 2 minutes
Yeah there fucking mad why do you think killing trees is good its bad don't subscribe to this guy
Why kill trees?
dude wear gloves with the poison....just saying.
Why is it that I watched this video at 1.75x speed and clearly heard him say "Arsenal" as the herbicide and thought to Google it, but dozens of other people can't manage to hear it and write comments asking everyone else what he said? Do people really not know how to go back on a video to try to hear something again? Do people not know how to use the Googles to do the searches?
You shouldn't  be cutting down any trees ! You are destroying earth !
Don't destroy nature .... Nature know what it needs .... And dont prompt this type of videos
Is that Aresenal herbicde?
That herbicide is very dangerous. Bad for you and the land itself. The history of herbicide and pesticide is a history of discontinued products. Each new one being “ safe” until 20 years of evidence illuminating the danger to your health and the health of the land.
All tree's should be wanted? They give oxygen out. Take they carbon dioxide. Sadly to many tree's killed down for 5g at the moment. Those chemicals not good for the bees or environment
Lol this doesn't even make sense. You say to get rid of the trees that aren't as economically friendly as others, yet you're spraying hickory and poplar. Not to mention that poplar is a very popular logging tree, and hickory is edible and used for teas. Small trees also don't take nutrients from larger trees, if anything, it's the opposite. These trees have thrived side-by-side for millennia. They don't need your "help".
Just cut the tree down.  Spraying chemicals in the forest. Come on
we are suppose to be teaching" how to preserve and not how to ;kill"!!
In spite of repeated requests in the comments section for  more details of the chemical used, he has not replied !!!!
what was inside the spray some one please suggest me ....i dont understand
You're the most evilest person ever made
How to kill unwanted humans?
What is the herbicide your using? You kinda glossed over that rather quickly.
Where do you buy arsenal herbicide?
0: 55, Wait! That's a nice bow-making hickory sapling.
pero porqué matarlos si nos dan oxígeno ellos nos dan vida
Exactly which type of arsenal do I get?  And after the tree is killed and cut, is the wood safe to burn as firewood? Thanks
There it's deead that's dead this one deead all deeeaad
Fuck killing trees. !!! Unbelievabke ppl want to destroy their own life lines. They say that is evolution. Wtf ever
You shouldnt make vids like this. Instead you should tell people to call a tree person or company for advise. With this vid, scumbag eco fascists, antifa, blm and leftists will do this everywhere...if their not already
It seems really lazy, and will be more of a hassle and dangerous to knock down dead trees.
It that drop of poison is enough to kill an entire tree I would be afraid to use it.
I absolutely love trees but my daughter has a small garden with 4 huge trees...there is never any sun that can get through...problems with bird mess on her washing...there's a beautiful cherry tree but the pigeons eat the lot before we can pick them.
Instead of poisoning the watershed and being a lazy toxic old man, get a small chainsaw even the oil from one would be better then this
Yes kill everything. The faster the better.
This is mass murder
Fires free .....get a pack of matches from the gas station..... and you can burn down the tree and as a bonus also some houses,a field, perhaps the forest, remember ....more is better , why stop at one tree  , or even a neighbor's houses... perhaps the gas station you got the matches at. !!!!!! You know why are they giving away matches ....that causes fires??? Anyway ....c'est la vie .....You got think outside the box !!!!!
Fireworks well too
Fireworks well too
Chain and saw
Serial tree killer
Is this herbicide persistent?
Trees lives matter.
Keel keel keel all the white trees.
Thou shall not kill 😇
This dude is a killer.
“Dat goan diah”
Very interesting, but he didn't clearly say what the herbicide is, so therefore not really effective video.  Whatever the brand is (arsenal herbicide???) , it isn't available universally,  What is its active ingredients please.?
Copper nails
Trees are alive!!!!
He could get a job with HS2 they like killing trees
Will straight roundup work?
Does this work on black and yellow locust trees? I have tons of both
I have found cutting the bark all the way around the tree in a 2" strip, no chemicals needed, has killed every tree I have tried it on. It stops the tree from getting water.
Please let me know what chemicals you are squirting. Will the tree shrink and die or it will fall of? Please revert on this. Thanks.
What was in the spray? I couldn't understand.
If it's your tree just cut it down!
This is only a good option for trees you are not allowed to remove (because it belongs to the neighbor). Otherwise I'd just cut them of.
What is the name of poison
Can’t ever imagine to kill a tree
no need to use a herbicide just remove the bark of tree herbicde kills you and make you sick
Thank you for the infor. What is the name of the herbicide?
Yer, destroy the planet...
I had a peach tree maturing into 10 years and out of nowhere one day the maintenance man of my community which never touched any of my garden or property within lines, one day he cut my trees back and did a horrible job as well. The next year another maintenance crew came in and informed me that the peach tree had cancer because it had a sap coming out ot the branches and it wasn't giving any new leaves considering the new season in spring..., Till this day it stopped bearing leaf and fruit and I planted it over 10 years ago waiting for it to mature just for an ignorant man using dirty tools on my garden  I'm wondering if he did something like this because he was an I'll man and caught drinking on the job and fired just after he touched my trees.
KILL  well i hope a tree soon finds an easy way to kill a unwanted bheing that KILLS trees.
Treebeard is watching you!
Monsanto must be proud of you !
One hit, one squirt, that trees dayed.
So much for biodiversity in your forest.
what brand name are you using to mix with water?
What mixture did you use ?
Idiotic to just encourage people to use herbicide willy nilly.
I dont like to kill trees.  but this helps me with big old woody unwanted weeds when im clearing acreage.
This is why humans will die of climate change disaster.
Thanks for the advice my neighbor will not even know what hit it.
What was that solution that he used ?
Will this work on a tree with 3’ diameter trunk?
dam!  he killin' trees
Drill holes into the roots and inject Tordon. It won’t take long for the tree to die
“Woan Haayit an sqwort and thayat trays deeyaid!”
What is that one little squirt gonna do?
you pay far more for pollar & hickory then you do for oak !!!
Something about him walking around going "hit, squirt, he ded" just makes me laugh lol
If you speak tree, you can hear all the screams.
Let's do one on how to kill unwanted assholes.
The narration was great. The music absolutely sucked!
What herbicide do you prefer
It is easier to cut it down...then to poison environment....that kills everything....when people will understand that all the cides...kill everything around and not only what is on the label...it's a big scam and a lie...and half of the chemicals are nit published nor reviled even to politicians who question the corporations...
The up coming video: How to kill the person who kill trees,with the same small hatched,so your elbow doesn't hirts you🤷‍♂️
Despicable arrogant humans.  Destroying the ecosystem. 👎👎
I mean there should be more than enough nutrients to go around lol
I prefer to wack in squirt, but to each their own.
That’s dead!!
Anyone using this stuff is putting themselves and others and all life around the stuff at risk!
I full-time RV. the park where I’m am currently, the idiots spray weed killer on everything so they don’t have to water the grass in the summer. Since I’ve been parked here two trees have been cut down, one on each side of my rig. I now sit in 114deg weather (at times) Quite pieces of shit, the management. Altogether there’s probably been 25 trees cut down due to poor health in this park. So, management here know really well how to kill a tree.
The producer could have spent more than 1/2 second on the name of what's in the solution.  Too late for the video.  But, please put the name of what's in the solution in the description.  Get specific please on the mix - how much water to how much ?????
It is a shame to be using toxic chemicals on that otherwise pristine land
This makes no sense to me. Just remove the tree.
In a way this is absolutely horrible. In another way it promote more space for  ... Nop.
POISON IS FOREVER...... IMPROVING YOUR FOREST MEANS SELECTIVE CUTTING AND USING WHAT YOU CUT FOR OTHER USEFULL PURPOSES. SUCH A CHIPPING FOR GOOD MULCH OR BUILDING GARDEN FUNITURE .
Have a neighbor you don’t like go kill all their trees in no time lol
Good Information. What is the name of the chemical again?Thank you...
George Bush?
Interesting.   Now that was something to learn about. Love to see the after when it’s all said and done
Does it work on big trees? 10-15 meters high
Killing isn't the problem. Affording the company to cut them down is.
Most efficient way to kill a tree:  start chainsaw, make knotch, make back cut. Block and split dry and put it in your stove. Remove ashes rinse and repeat
I assume this would work on Aspen trees also...
I wish we coud see a video on how to eradicate pay to hunt.
I use a 1/2-inch wood auger in a battery drill and fill the hole with Roundup.  Tree dies in a year.
Dude!! Just chop the suckers down!!!!
I was just thinkin... yknow what the world has too much of? Trees.
If you kill a tree you are a damn  Idiot. Save Nature 🤘🏼
No mention of how long that shit persists after using it. People are getting soft. Don't want to clear brush? > herbicide.
This is harmful not helpful.  Environmentally a bad idea.  Just get some one qualified to cut the dam tree.  Stupid post.
Kill the tree's. You kill the World eventually.
I quit using chemicals in my 20s
I just redirect the occasional thunderstorm to strike my unwanted trees with extreme precision. First you need to call your local rapper and have him drop a good song live at your house then you call your local witch doctor to cast a lightning spell over the unwanted trees then quickly call your local power company to survey the land and lastly you wrap tin foil around your head and have the cell phone towers point their 5g apparatus at the thunderstorm and with the technology transferred into the cloud as many as 142 precise lightning strikes will simultaneously hit all the trees you wish to be gone.  It’s a technique the pioneers used.
Y’all can have y’all’s little motors and chains…I do it with a polished axe. Swinging hard, muscles glistening in the sun, working out and sweating toxins. The chicks dig it and you get laid twice as much my friends.  I mean if you’re lucky enough to have chicks on your property while you mindlessly work and your wife doesn’t mind
That's so mean to do to a tree. I just get my shot gun out and blow its bark into smitheries lol
American farming at its finest.
A tree saw this and decided to get revenge. The tree made a video on how to cook adopted human soup.
Ban people that kill trees! They kill people! Like guns!
Just ring bark the tree, it's takes a minute or too longer, but zero chemicals required.
@0:28 "arsenal herbicide"? Is that an arsenic-based herbicide? Please add the correct name into the video description.
I have done similar to that. We would always use straight poison. It doesn't seem enough the small cuts, but it obviously works if you made this video.
Why not just cut the bad trees away instead of the poison. They're trees but still sounds cruel to poison.
its easy to cut him than use chimecals you poison the earth
Nonsense!!!!!!!  Up here in the Northeast part of Pennsylvania you can't kill trees with that ridiculous method.  Starters, folks: you can't kill a Mimosa tree with a full 5 INCH INCH GIRDLE - cut and/or poison: You can't girdle, poison, cut down or eliminate Black Walnut trees by any method. They will continue to regrow for 25 years as bushes: You can't kill, girdle or poison Wisteria (Vines/Weeds/Trees). They can't be killed. Cutting, girdling and poison doesn't work on Mimosa's, Black Walnuts, Wisteria, Trident Maples, Pawlonia trees  and various other  northern species trees.  Nothing "simple" about this nonsensical method, Bobby. You are flat out incorrect.
Poison. The devils choice to kill.
Eye protection please
What kind of chemical?
What herbicide?
This guy is like the Steven Segal of forestry, one hit you're dead.
Deer and bear eat hickory nuts, not to mention people. What's your problem with hickory?
I like the popular trees they make as much as red oak and grow 10 times faster
I wish I had seen this video about 5 years ago.   My neighbors had some ridiculously overgrown shrubs that I would have loved to do this to.   They finally cut them down this past weekend.
oh this is both amazing and horrifying  imagine someone using it maliciously
Well I have news for ya. All ya have to do is sit on your land for 30 ta 40 years within the National Forrest Service. Notice; "Service?" Well not anymore. They do nothing but let dead debree pile up, logs on top of dead dry logs, and one day pof! There's lightning and your whole property burns with it.
If that spray you are using is that strong that it will kill a tree with one squirt I believe I would be wearing rubber gloves.
what Chemical is it again mixed with water?
I just hate to see trees destroyed just so someone can make money.  Sickens me.
I have never heard of arsenal, I have been using round-up but getting variable results . is it my herbicide or the method I use that needs improvement. also I have been trying to kill carragana , used 2-4-d , round-up, banvel and mcpa , so far with a 0% kill , do you or anyone else have any experience with carragana ?
Or you could use a chain saw.
It seems interesting. But what is Arsenal? (I have to translate it in German and didn´t found anything like this).
Some kid is going to watch this and go to the local park with 100 year old trees.
Cutting off a 1 foot high section of tree bark all the way around a tree is just as effective.  It may take a couple years for the tree to actually die of but it does work.  I know I got in trouble for doing this to one of my dads trees he wanted to keep but I thought was a pain to mow around.
I came for the comments, clearly by myself.
Y’all are some pathetic pos.
Like ,,,,,,, tordon
F@#kin idiot does not understand anything about Ecosystems and Diversity Bc of The Almighty Buck? F@ck the buck
We have some Big Timber up here in the northwest Stihl chainsaw Style carbon belching two-cycle engine beasts
Killing a tiny tree is a waste of time and wood, just pluck it off.
why is hickory an undesirable tree? they produce fabulously strong wood and delicious for smoking meats
Sad
Of course he is from the south..most don't like trees!! How bout let nature do what nature does,it's been doing it far longer than us.
Seems to me that a chainsaw is quicker and more effective.  You're going to use it next year anyway to remove the trees you poisoned.
THIS IS BAD IDEA! This same posion will go to your good trees too. Waste of money and waste of nature.
whats weird is i feel like im watching a mass murderer .
"20% arsenal herbicide"?  How about a brand name?
I did similar. I drilled a small hole and injected a few cc's of full strength herbicide into a garbage tree and it not only killed that tree, but killed HUGE sweetgum that was about 20 feet down gradient from it.  So I can not recommend this method.
How to kill your planet
where do you get arsenal herbicide?
I imagine you are quite fixated with killing things.
A saw works Aswell just saying.
I heard copper nails work. Haven't tried it yet...
Why not just cut them?
This is the 10 year method
Why not get a chainsaw and cut it down?
Why is this in my feed... I don't eat trash
Why not pull the unwanted trees out of the ground, root and all, when they are small enough to do so. The larger one  could be cut down  then chipped or used as firewood.
What exactly is the spray, and will it kill the root system of sweet gums?
Great video. I have some invasive trees I need to get rid of.
The Tree Assassin strikes again.
That was pretty darn interesting
Why are there no weeds on the forest floor? I am fighting a losing battle against prickly vines and weeds and appreciated the forest floor being so weed free.
Why don't you just cut them down?
I reported this crap. With all this planet has endured what we need is learning more ways to poison and kill natural sources of life!
Yeah evil at its finest great work scumbag tree killa loser just to make money you make me sick to the point where I want to spray you with that shit 💪
chainsaws work pretty good
Where can I purchase Arsenal Herbicide? Is it sold under that name?
If you want to kill a tree during this whole month if you just cut a ring clear around the tree and remove the bark and about an inch area till you'll be dead by fall
I use a chainsaw but this is a good idea
Chainsaw works well and about the same work unless you're just letting them rot and fall. Then you have a thicket
Dont u think the forest already knows what to do?
Someone has been committing eco-terrorism on my property.
Just cut it ffs, stop adding synthetic chemicals evrywhere
does systemic weed killer work? like round up or the like? thanks
i'd like to know if it works on wwild cherry trees and , and other root propagating trees, having a hard time keeping the yard clean XD
ring barking also works without chemicals
If you want a tree gone you ring bark it! Never fails
What a great name for female hacker, Hack&Squirt! Anyhow, my question is, do this product work on neighbors?
How to murder a tree
Become a man, and get a chain saw.
Now can you do one on how to kill unwanted humans?
What a stupid video. I was expecting to learn how to kill unwanted trees. The question wasn’t even addressed. What hack did he use to kill unwanted trees? What special chemical did he use to kill unwanted trees? He didn’t even mention it. A stupid useless video. Thanks for wasting my time
I don’t get this method, you still have to go back and cut or mulch the dead trees. Why not cut them down and put Tordon on the stump?
What chemical do you use?   Thanks
Bad Karma bro. Real bad Jujjie...
For those of us that can't understand this level of accent. What did he say he mixed?
سر  sir  Please tell me the name of herbeside.?
Sinister tree murderer
Obviously, you never seen a rainforest, no tree will take energy from another one, there is a beneficial symbiotic relationship between different species, that's how forests are so successful spraying herbicides is very damaging to the environment, wild life as well as human life. Watching this makes me very cross.
This method takes far too long. My mate brings his tractor over with a cable winch that does the job That same day.
what kind of  "herbicide."
I do the same with people.
an escavaror??
Thank you
My neighbors 100 foot poplars are going to meet their maker now.  Thanks
Can you mention the name of this product
Imagine if we replanted trees instead of killing them.
Will the solution you use kill off ivy which is suffocating trees
Sorry what did he say is in the squirt bottle again.?
Pls do at your body the same  I want see if you are more powerful than tree
Hack and squirt. That reminds me of an old girlfriend.
To kill an innocent tree, is a crime against heaven and earth.
Hello, I would like to know what your using for spray, and how long does it take until the tree dies please?
Will it work on Palo Verde trees? (I think they're considered bushes that look like a tree)
What is the liquid contains?
Some tremendous information.  Is there a better time of the year to apply this chemical? I am weary of battling fence row trees.  Is there a problem applying this to trees around a pond?  Anyone's response is welcome.  I am an older lady with next to zero experience in fighting brush and trees. Chain saw is about the only thing I knew to use to clear out unwanted growth. Thanks and Jesus bless.
Can you say the name of the chemical that you use thanks for your reply
killing trees. good idea. it.s like smoking while having lung cancer already. dig them tf up and plant them somewhere else
What is the liquid
We had beautifull forrest until humans came along
How sad. They go through all the trouble to be a winner, and the old man comes with the axe. Yes, it can happen to you. For in this world, we are seeds only. That is why there is so many of us. We are only potential. Once you are one of the few, putting your head into the heavens... maybe some old shit comes and spray you :)
hickories produce mast..why kill them?
Anybody give that man some same shit stupid
Why to kill trees ? What harm do they do ? Don't they provide us oxygen and other things for our survival  ? So why to kill them ? Why not to transplant them instead ?  Aren't we responsible for making this planet a dangerous place to live  ?
There are no unwanted trees
I took out a Syringa tree and now I sit with hundreds sprouting out , its taking over my garden.
If you want to leave a standing tree to die, which has a lot of good use once dead and standing, simply cut through the inner bark or cambium all the way around the tree. No herbicides are necessary. Cut a ring around the whole tree through the cambium and it cuts off the water and nutrient supply. Then a year later will be still standing and dead.
How to kill unwanted humans TLF the Tree Liberation Front we aren’t a method of product we’re living beings just like you humans
Does this stuff go up into the leaves, which then fall to the ground and poison everything else? Or does it just stay in the tree?
Why kill hickory trees? He says it will never make a harvestable log. Tells me he knows nothing about trees. I have one across from my house that's at least 3 feet across.
I didn't hear very well when he stated what herbicide he used. Is it something available at a home hardware?
This is disgusting, poisoning trees to death and boasting how cheap it is. Just drink some of that fluid and be gone forever.
Better title: how to kill the neighbors tree
What chemicals do you use? I’m in the UK
Yeah why should i cut the unwanted trees with a saw when i can kill them with poison.
Don't kill trees, we need them for shade and Oxygen!!!
Nice to keep adding poisons to the landscape. Wouldn't a 45% strength vinegar accomplish the same?
What did he say 'arsenal' herbicide?
do you poison birds of prey too?
Can you tell me the name of that herbicide and where to find it please?
Don't support BASF
Just cut it down. You have to anyways.  Do not be an idiot.
What was the herbicide used?
This guy needs some protective gear or that herbicide will do to him what it's doing to the trees.
Trees like these I'll dig up, apply rooting hormone, and replant them on hillside areas that have been prone to erosion. Have also used same method to create what amounts to be the natural equivalent of a privacy fence.
Will this work on oleanders?
That poison ends up in the soil stupid idea
I find a 41 Stihl works pretty good. Then bribe the neighbor with a cold one to bring over his D-4 for the root wad.
Then what they fall and kill you. DUMB cut them down if you don't want them.
What's Arsenal Herbicide?
I respect the fact that he owns his own land and he wants to have it a certain way but our wildflowers really a good reason to be killing trees I mean financial value isn't the only value in this world. What about the value they have for the environment? Well a wildflower ever do what a tree would I mean is a wildflower ever going to take the amount of carbon out of the air that a tree is no so I think if you own your own land the only real reason to drop trees is to help other trees grow better not for fucking flowers
you will never convince someone that supports permaculture. Its a nice antinatural and boring little forest.
I would stop killing trees if I were you we’re probably gonna need the extra oxygen really soon plus they’re beautiful..
Think he said  that's a wild flower area, obviously flowers need sunlight and trees are blocking it
I use my cordless drill with a 3/8ths bit & drill several holes around the tree at a good downward angle, if it's a big tree I'll do 3 - 4 holes angled as deep as the bit goes. The angle of the hole keeps the RU from running out. The first squirt sucks in pretty fast so I refill the holes again if the tree is super thick & has Dutch elm, or a big ash tree with ash Boer I give the tree more RU. In a couple of weeks, it starts to die off. And soon I'm making firewood for hunting camp.
WTF in an "akern"? 😆
Can you do a similar video on hack & squirt for unwanted people? 🤣
Is that Glysophate ?
Pl. GV name of spray or tell the of thing to kill giant pippal tree
My lazy neighbour has a maple growing out of their foundation that's leaning into my house as it grrows. Problem solved. Thanks.
What is the herbicide? Where do I get it?
Question tho why do this posion whatever that is instead of just cutting them down or just digging them up and replanting them somewhere else?
The Lorax is pissed
Why will it never be a log lol its called let ot grow its an immature tree still its an Oak its gona get Big just not fast enough for you to turn a profit smh
What is the formula?
Why not use a chainsaw?  get the light straightaway and no toxic chem
Would a squirt of round up work?
Thats stupid. Just cut a band of bark all the way around the tree. 4" or more. It dies . Wait till you need firewood. Its standing dead and dry. Dont use chemicals.
Thanks for the advice. The council has now decided to remove a dead tree from my nature strip that they refused to remove when it was alive. They replanted a new one the same that accidently got ran over and will probably continue to be accidently run over.
Your an A hole for showing people this. People destroy trees in public places because they don't want leaves on their car when they park to go to work. For God sake just tell them to cut it down. The size trees your talking about you can cut by hand even.
The environmentally friendly way....TO KILL A TREE!
I can't see this small amount killing a tree
Imagine if someone did it to this guy as he is old and considered worthless!
Seems a shame to kill a living thing
I would like to see the results the following year .
I'm in lower Michigan and I need this done immediately.
There is a reason over 2.2k dislike with video..... downvoted
Imagine if someone does this in the amazon thinking that the floor or ground needs solar light 🤔
What you used in the spray bottle to kill those 🌳
What kind of herbicide?
Now you will have a dead standing tree. Why not just cut it down
The hickory would have provided good food for the wildlife.
I found a chainsaw and chipper works amazing
I understand.  We have a few that are splitting. Soon to fall.  A tornado took alot but now have widow makers.  Many reasons. White ash I believe is like a pencil. Snaps super easy. To many to list.
Just cut it down you feeble old shit.. don't buy that garbage
Poisoning your forest. Where is the logic?
gatro...
Neighbour's
I cannot make out what herbicide hes using. What is it??
There is no such thing as a unwanted tree.
Tree racist ! ! !
why not just cut them down... versus using poison that will seep into the ground
53 YO Navy Corpsman Here...  I Play a Lot of Disc Golf, (in the Woods)  I Wish some trees were gone Sometimes.....
Just Wonderin........... are the Crazy tree hugger folks, ok?? lol!!
how can I kill a bradford pear a neighbor planted in front of my house... long story, he is deceased now and I feel like its time for the tree to go...
Will this work for Tree of Heaven?
There are some firms who transplant trees that stand in an inconvenient place. The firms have special tools for getting bigger trees out of the ground without damaging the roots. You will probably be able to find articles about this on the internet. Trees supply oxygen to the atmosphere and will postpone climate change.
Deer eat oak seedling
We r from India.pls mention what you spray ... could you please explain 🙏🙏🙏
With all the Parkinson's caused by herbicide and the effects of agent orange. How toxic is this shit? What's it going to do to people? How much poison are the killing us with for profits again.
This will works also with a parasitic politicians, businessmans?
Tree murderer! 😠
Why not just cut down small trees and skip the poison?
With over half of the worlds forests gone thats all we need is you teaching people not how and why trees should be planted, but how to kill one.  Great ….
Um.....if you use the bigger axe with your tender old elbow you can hit 'em once and they'll fall in half.  What is this weird preoccupation with poisons?
No safety breathing apparatus? 😖
Yeah this is a good idea if you want a bunch of standing dead timber on your property
I'm not glove guy but with arsenic and water in a spray bottle I would definitely consider not ending up like one of his treated trees ...
SOMEONES GOING TO PAY IN THE LAND CALLED MERSEYSIDE IN ENGLAND ALTHOUGH THOU NOT BY ITS BANKS ITS LOCATION BOUNDARIES ARE GIVEN TO SURTOUNDING DISTRICTS WITHIN VICINITY HOW AM I GOING TO DO THAT MY PROPERTY.

Killing a tree is a crime. And will award you a year in prison in the Andalusia Provence of Spain.
It is not about you.
Killing a tree is a crime.
Not exactly what I do. I saw the tree about 3" from the ground. I take a 5/8" paddle bit and drill a hole 2" deep. I fill it with non diluted brush be gone. Gets rid of stubborn trees like paradise, mulberry, wild boxwood, and locust. 🐀🐾
I wrap copper wire tightly around the base; within a month, even the roots are dead (pulled right out of the ground).
Copper nail

Why He spray that poisen Like He ows the Planet?
Interesting, but it would be a lot more fun to watch using Tannerite. Could you do the video over that way please?
What’s name of that chemical you use it ??
East Tennessee....tulip poplars are the state tree!  I live in old growth beech,  oak and poplar woods. Avg age is 175-200 yrs. Dan'l and Davey walked this ridge and valley.   I'll have to look up the age to qualify for "old growth "..  235 yr old beech hit the house 5 yrs ago....now the  soil that was underneath is like concrete! Been in the shade for a looong time. Cool to watch succession take place...all new forest floor plants
Why not just cut it down?
Wouldn't think something that small would kill a tree
Perhaps a safer way to kill unwanted trees is to cut a one inch wide ring around the trunk through the cambium layer.  The tree will die and dry in place and can be used for lumber later.
Next year? Pffftt....My Stihl MS271 chainsaw does it immediately, no waiting at all.
How long do es it take for the tree to die
Just two questions ... 1.what other herbicides or weedicides or chemicals can kill big invasive tree species?   2. The squirts you did in the video...l assume you have to spray much more if the tree is much bigger?
Here in Indonesia, traditionally, we use fermented "Chilli sauce with shrimp paste". We call it "Terasi". Just put near the root.
That herbicide can be transferred through roots and michorrizal systems to other trees - be careful
Awesome video!
I cut down a few pine trees in my yard that were 2ft in diameter, or just a few inches more.  I have the stumps and I need to get rid of them without calling out the heavy equipment.  Will this product kill the stumps immediately so they can rot away quickly?  If not, if anyone could get me in the right direction, I would appreciate it.  I cut these pines out so my Hardwoods would not be affected by the pines as per advice from our DNR.  Thanks for your help.
Most interesting way to take the unwanted trees away. Thank you What was the liquid more than water?
Wish he could bring it to Colorado were weeds are the closest thing to a tree.
Very good information sir, thank you for posting this!
Would that work on a huge oak tree?
Forget that! One word.....Chainsaw.
Handling herbicides without protection.  I wonder how his leaves will be doing next spring?
I use the Stihl method - very effective - usually less than an hour.
"that's goin die" haha
what yea use roundup ? i have some trees i need gone
ending the tree's growth is the point of the video. will it's roots reproduce shoots the following year? spraying the tree will send upward growth termination and the roots are the life. i think i may have answered my question - if someone would kindly correct my thinking.
I understand this….but someone used this method on public trees and in a forest randomly devastated the forest
Gonna use this method around my apartment complex tired of the allergen spreading bullshit and all the fucking bee's can suck a dick too
He is funny as fuck wit no effort. I watched dis like 5x. …. Dats gon die!
please come and kill my neighbors tree tyvm
How long does it take to die?
I use a chainsaw and the existing trees seem to thrive on the exhaust
Please send this to the California forestry department so they can figure out how to send in the forest and prevent the fires that have been happening.
So so much timber fuel for stove cooking and winter fires. This man is blessed
Question from Texas, "Will it kill Mesquites????"  Boy, it costs a fortunne and takes forever to kill mesquites.
my sweet gum is still growing after tying this
Can this be done at any time of the year? Is one season better than others to maximize kill?
just girdle the tree, no chemicals required.
Arsenal herbicide? What herbicide? I have some trees in my yard that I can't get rid of no matter what... years & years & years
Lmmfao. I can smell the patchouli in this comment section.  Without reading one comment, I bet the title of this video triggered 95% of its viewers.

Hello mam/sir,where can I order chemicals kill tree
What is the name of this method
Can you do it to the root? And still have the same effect? When is it a good time to do it?
Does this work on pines?  I have used the generic version of spike 80, simply putting it on roots.  Seems to knock out the hardwoods, but the pines seem to be unphased.  I've not tried the hack and squirt method though, which I will certainly do now.    Where I live, trees are weeds, they're so invasive and get in the way of everything.  I live in the Ozarks, we literally can't get rid of them fast enough.
Don't kill trees
What kind of herbicide?
Does anyone have recommendations for trees that have just started to grow? Im in town and this is for a fence line. Some have large stumps because I kept using a small saw to keep cutting it down. Regular herbicide total vegetation killer has not worked.

Sir Bobby The Tree Slayer

My neighbor has this annoying tree whose leaves keep on falling into our compound. Now I know what to do.

If i can season firewood this way it might be worth trying. Anybody have opinion on that?
will this work on all the eucalyptus trees of California?
Old idea, I love oaks, but other trees have benefits that have escaped your awareness. I have a natural forest on my property, and I leave it that way. I also have old fields and waste areas that are too steep for conventional farming, it his here that I cultivate my oak plantings. Many of these oaks are less than 20 years old and are already producing mast for wild life. Most of these oaks I have propagated myself from local seed sources. It is OK, do what you want with your own forest, that is your privilege, but so often tampering with nature can back fire. I do work to remove invasive's such as buckthorn, but for the rest, I think a selection of diverse trees is most beneficial for nature.
What is the name of this liquid
Anybody have success with killing Brazilian Pepper and Saw Palmettos in Florida?
Would this work on big oak?
Killer
I am now going to kill my neighbors trees so that 🌞 can shine on my pool , shhhhh
They called a tree unwanted
Why aren't you wearing gloves!?!
I wonder if you can add a dye to mark the trees you treat?
Where do you get arsenal herbicide at? Of course you don't want to do dogwood because of mass for turkeys? What the hell are you talking about? And damn you got one heck of an accent. Akerns, really?
Some of you people have Zero respect for nature . Kill a tree just because you find it undesirable.  And you wonder why our planet is in such dire conditions.
Why not drive in a few copper nails?
Dear Mr Bobby,  Plz use subtitles for all your clips and vides, as your US English is very difficult for us to understand fully.. My problem will be universal except USA & may be in Canada..  Plz try to implement from next videos.. Regards from Pune, India

There’s a special place in hell…
Useless. No name of liquid
You Mossy Oak Game Keepers told about this method 3 to 5 years ago before COVID
Why don't you just cut down the unwanted trees? I'm not a expert, but it sound like a bad idea squirting pesticide around trees to give then a optimal performance
Hickory seems like a tree to keep to me. Great forage for wildlife.
Dear sir, I need what combination of that spray ,
The japanese weeded out some species with chemicals in in WW2  The Chinese have not forgiven them
Killing tree and killing us humans along with it, using arsenic compounds to pollute the environment, that is a a crime.
Instead of spreading poison all over the ground, why not just cut down the undesirable trees and they will become nourishment for the future trees once they decompose ?
Bamboo?
Can I use that stuff on you? Leave the native trees alone. I wish both the US and Canada would ban trees and shrubs not native to north America.
Good job people! You're giving the fire starters another way to eliminate our forests! Simply stupid!
Difficult understanding that accent, what is in that spray
Kill all the trees and we are deayyyd
Back in my days 40 years ago . Term take the bark around the base of a tree.will kill the tops Wrong time of year may try to grow back.  Told in the spring its  Making sap kill the top  And like bleeds to death   Note seen trees ants hollow  it out few inches and tree bark holding.  Odd it was still green and a live. . Best of luck...  remember widow  Makers
Don't teach such lessons..All trees are important..
If these are ROUNDUP ready or GMO  trees designed by the mill to be say insect and drought resistant and also grow fast,  I challenge you to try and kill these frankentree.sThey are completely alien to the wildlife that require natural vegetation for their survival ,is why oure forrests and freshwater are void of any life now, this powerful sterilizing poison has not been properly tested ,is not safe, and is banned bt the EU  and Russia had banned its use as well, in Canada here our leaders say use it. Lobbyists bribing our elected officials to peddle us poison.
what is the name off the product?
What chemical are you using to do that what is the name or how can I make that at home. Thx

I have a couple large gum trees about 40' from my garden.  Granted I've cut most of the roots out of the garden area, I fear I may have missed a few.  Would this method effect my garden?
Will you please type in the name of the herbiside you have used?
Thats the dumbest thing I have ever seen. Use chemicals when you can just cut it down. Dumbest ideal ever. Not to mention the wood could be used for smoking or axe handles or chairs ect. Dumb. Not to mention poplars are hard to find.

In Allah's heaven now there are trees of deep green leaves. Allah said your actual property is in the sky. Now I can enjoy the nature even in open heart surgery. Allah said Allah eliminates one gang to another if Allah don't do this then whole land was become unpeaceful. Allah's land is very big/large. Watch more formula from Al Quran verses.💯🍔🎾🌈🛸🌴🥕🚲🪔🧃🌳🍕🚀💐💥 Allah said I have teached human with pen. I have teached him that he never knows that. Allah said I have nothing left in this kitab ()book Al Quran Allah said those who do kofori and stops the path of Allah subhanaho tala Allah will make all their activities spoiled.   We have to kill,stop them who cut tress and corrupt muslim mood.

Great Video. Thanks for the info.
No way it's that easy!
Old boy looked like rambo leaving nothing but death behind him 🤣 Everything is dead.
Could I use Garden Glyphosate Weedkiller instead?
"undesirable trees"   the trees are just trying to live and you are cutting them down. there's no need to cut down a whole tree when only one branch is threatening your house. and cutting down trees because it ruins your view is the most sociopathic thing i ever heard. you're essentially mass murdering just bc the trees in the way slightly inconvenience you. you have some nerve and human supremacy to be doing this when it's not necessary
neighbors tree 😵
Chainsaw!

What chemical did HE say it was??  Probably something that ALSO causes Cancer!  BE careful out there...!
Man, if you don't tell us what kind of fuckin'mixture you are using, this video is useless
Drill 2 or 3  3/4" holes in a big tree about 4 inches  deep down at an angle pour it full of table salt, a small tree 1 hole will work...
Now that tree is "dayyd"
Does it work on privet? Just curious as cutting them down only creates more...
How long does it take to kill a tree ?
It’s illegal to kill trees in West Texas!!  🤣🤣🤣
If George W hadn't entered politics...
What is the mixture in Spray bottle? That would be some useful information.
Hi the same for a big tree
cut it down would be much faster.
How about a chain saw, wouldn't that be faster ?
Akerns
Can you make a video for making the mix, bedst regards and love👏🤘
And now you know why there are so many short school buses compare to 30 years ago. Ps the little retards have been poision by lazy weak men
Thank you
I wonder how that spray bottle and hatchet work for cleaning up next year's mess..
If that little bit can kill a tree, I don’t think I’d be messing with it.
Can you recommend something for bramley apple tree

Dont kill animals and you wont need worry about forrests rivers pollution etc. We humans are soo on the brink to extinct everything
Can you imagine the horror those poor trees must feel when they see this mass murderer approach, most of them surely freeze in sheer panic.
This guy is straight tree mercenary.
Which product is this?
That trees are planted by your father👿👿???? How did you got the permission to kill these trees????👹💩💩💩
Which liquid use for.
Didn't he say Arsenal Herbicide?
I used fire. Rake dry leaves into the base of the tree, light fire. Do this every time once leaves fall from the tree. The roots will die from the heat perhaps after two or three times of doing this. How much did that cost you? 🤔
how much time does it take to die after being cut and sprayed ??
Can this be done on banana trees too?
y'all ain't got no chainsaws down thar?
Little Cut On a Tree..  WONT KILL ANYTHING.. WHERES THE ANGRY CHAINSAW VIDEOS.. I NEED TO SAVE MY BATHROOM TOILET DRAINS FROM TREES GROWING OUT OF CONTROL CRAZZZY IN THE FRONT YARD..

Hello... sorry people someone can tell to me what is this product using to kill tree???
Please write the name of the chemical that you used.  Also to kill the tree do you have to spray on the main trunk of the tree? I have a neighbor's useless tree that is branching into my property and causing me annoyance. I can spray this on the btranch on my side . Will it work?. Please respond. Thanks
Could you recommend a couple brands thanks
Why would you kill a tree 😡😡😡😡🌳😭😭
Did not get the solution you use to spray the wound or cut  caused by the axe. How many times is this procedure to be repeated if at all.
Don't drill 1/2" hole in the neighbours pine trees 4" deep and fill the hole with roundup , it won't kill them (ask me how I know)......😕
That tree would curse for the slow death😱
Tress are good for privacy ,you must be a nosy neighbor always looking
just peel off the skin of tree all around, tskk
Make it easier. Just separate a piece of bark from the tree or better yet. Make a ring  around the tree's trunk and pour SULFURIC ACID on the open area and presto. Note: just battery acid will do. At 35% sulfuric acid to 65% water. IT DOES NOT FAIL. 11/21/2020
MURDER!!
Which liquid.
Will that method work on popcorn trees? (South MS)
What is the mixture that you are spraying because I want to kill the tree planted infront of the since the roots spread out and grow another tree. I want to change it but I can kill it without anybody knowing it. Thanks
I could really use this for willow...  cutting it down just makes it sprout more....

What is the water please
Does this work on much larger trees, like giant oaks?
i cant understand him, what does he mix with water ?
Can someone please post a link to the product he used in his spray bottle? I know he mentions water but would like to know the exact product. TIA.
Why not just chop it down???  Wouldn’t that be easier?
I suppose a chain saw only chops the tree trunk but the roots are still alive.
I've gotta axe a quick question, what's in the bottle?
"... encourage growth of native browse vegetation for wildlife."  !!!!!!!! Encourage growth of wild fire fuel!
Copper nails work well !!!!!
What is the product ?
How can we even think trees are unwanted?😔😔😔
I have taken a chainsaw and went around a large tree making a ring around it and sprayed roundup in it and it still has not died. Next step is to cut it down.
It’s great when someone posts a video about using a great product and then give absolutely no info on the product. WTF man! And in addition, the morons won’t answer you when you inquire about the product. Fukin amazing!
Why use herbicide when cutting the bark in a circle around the tree will kill it
Thank you Mr. Watkins - Very interesting and good work for a great purpose.  👍🏼
My neighbor's plum tree roots are now messing up the cement at this rate within a 5-7 year it can possibly effect the water pipe.  This video is definitely helpful

Where does one buy rhis "arsenal" herbicide?
Ah, poison,  the answer to all of life's challenges,  what could possibly go wrong?
Does this method also work for buckthorn?
I am not green deal supporter, but why this idiot is doing this?. Fuck old scumbag should be held accountable
Does this work on eastern red cedar?
He is to dumb to know that Dog Woods Require shade to live
how about walking in there with a chain saw and have instant success in clearing the area of unwanted trees and scrub brush.maybe that is just to much to ask.since you will need to clear these dead trees out eventually,why screw with waiting for them to die?
I tried that on a 8' diameter redwood. We'll see....
Does this work on salt cedar trees? They are the hardest trays to kill
My neighbor is an old guy, lifelong smoker, coughs a lot and has bladder issues. I just found a new nickname for him! 🤣🤣🤣
What is he spraying
Shutup you old fart....if all tree die human race would soon be dead. This oldie has to die a year or two later in any case....no skin of his back
I might not be an arborist but....won’t a chainsaw work quicker?
Felling with a chainsaw and rock salt on the stump would be a lot quicker
Damn a chainsaw would've killed them now .
What is the mix sir... I couldn't understand
I tried this on my wife... doesn’t work
So... why wouldn’t you just cut it down?

What is the liquid name
Lol just cut about 1" of bark off all the way around the tree and it will 100% kill any tree with NO POISON
The problem with using an arsenic compound is that it is persistent - once used, it will be there forever.  Nut trees and fruit trees that are grown on treated areas will always yield fruits that contain traces of arsenic.
Thank you Sir.. 😊
Why would you educate people to kill trees?? Dont you think the planet is suffering enough from commercial deforestation? Cant see any reason for doing that in a healthy forest! You are a vandal sir.

“One little hit, squirt...one little hit, squirt...this tree is dead.” Interesting but that’s one female tree I don’t want to mess with, or do I? 🤔😐
But what is it you’re spraying.
Our farm supply ultimately suggested Tardon RTU (Ready To Use) which is premixed so it is not restricted handling as are more powerful concentrations that require license permits.  Twelve dollars a quart.  From his own experience the other supplier recommended Remedy Ultra but might not be as easy to purchase neither place was sure if the permit was required.  He said they are using Arsenal which is the product name.
Advice on what brands a home owner can buy to kill unwanted trees that grow next to a house or in garden beds that keep coming back and invasive species like Bradford pear trees that seem to pop up everywhere. These are useless garbage trees that never should have been planted.
Or you could just cut the tree down instead of poisoning the living shit out everything.

Another option....good for multi-floral rose is  Pathfinder    https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/agrian-cg-fs1-production/pdfs/Pathfinder_II1e_Label.pdf   Its a basal treatment.  Very effective in killing trees up to 6 inches diameter....and or on larger stumps......brush. No prep needed. Squirt and go.
I tried this method and even drilled few holes in the trunk and poured Arsenal herbicide nothing happened and tree still growing at my entrance and damaging my car parking floor and the gate is raised from one side by almost 3 inches. Its roots also penetrated in water storage sump which is 15 feet far from it. I am desperately trying solution for the past 3 years with no success. Unfortunately I can't simply cut that tree cause its situated 2 feet far from my property and it is conserved for environmental issues. Please somebody suggest some concrete solution.
Tordon?
And where can I buy this product
When is the best time to spray
Don't do this
What herbicide should I use? & can I just use straight herbicide or do I need to mix water?
The Arsenal you are using, what percentage strength is it...26% or 53% ?   And, about how long does it take for the trees you treated in this video to be completely dead?  Thanks.

Hi, I have some few questions. Is herbicide a very toxic chemical?  The tree that I am planning to kill is about 3-4 meters from my house, is that safe? What happened to the tree then when poisoned? It's kind a big tree and the braches may fall and cause damages and injury. Thanks
Just want to kill the neighbors tree, thanks.
Thank you sir because we have so many unwanted trees.i can’ t plant vegetables, flower and fruit trees because of those. I’m tired of cutting them. I told my husband those trees should be in the forest, not in our front and backyard.
Is this method good for oak trees? Thank You
Stop destroying trees we need them for the health of our environment every tree matters in fact you should be planting them
What name of liquid available in India

Who thought it could be so easy? Thanks! Now I can start reclaiming my backyard! =^[.]^=
You shouldn’t kill any tree!
When the guy put the axe on the tree, tree says OMG
This should be done to every single Hackberry tree on the planet...worst tree ever, it's not even worth burning.
Copper nails driven 3/4 of their length into the tree works too.Leave the head exposed for easy extraction.
Don't kill  tree,.  because you get oxygen, Free !
Some trees undesirable to human are desirable to birds, monkeys and squirrels.  So let them live. Large scale killing of trees will bring adverse consequences in the future.
I own land and I don’t believe in killing trees
Will this work during winter or dormant months in the north?

Chemical name write in ur description box

I have a more effective method.  Take a 3/8 drill and drill into the base of the trunk at a slight downward angle and using a funnel flood the inside of the hole with arsenal!  Damned Chinese Elms are so invasive!

What is cheaper than roundup?
Bobby is using an arsenal herbicide
The most important piece of information in this clip is glossed over quickly and never explained.  People watch this because they want to know how to kill a tree not watch you walk around the forest hacking tree trunks. Say the name of the chemical that kills the tree. Say it clearly, maybe spell it.  Tell us where to get it.  Could’ve been very helpful but was useless video.

Just hack a ring around the tree and put the chemicals away. With a ring cut around the tree no fluids or nutrients can get up the tree through the bark and the tree will die.
Wait, what he using arsenic? gotta wonder what else is dead near those trees...
Why not use a chainsaw? Or an axe, or otherwise suitable tool? Poison is poison. Even weed trees deserve some respect. Will that dead tree be a good healthy link in the chain of decay and nutritional uptake that is the cycle of life? Glyphosate is persistent, and kills invertebrates if it gets into the waterways. Wonder where the insects all are? Insecticides. Duh. And so on....
Glyphosate herbecide for best chemical to kill a tree
What is chemical name?
We need trees to breathe oxygen. Thanks
Does anyone know what I can get in Canada to kill Cedar?

The worse are Russian Olive tree and elm which is commonly called Chinese trees growing wild.
,rings
After the tree is dead for awhile and has dried out could you use it as campfire wood or something like that or do the chemicals make it unsafe to burn?
Will this work on The invasive honeysuckle bush? My property is covered with this and I can’t stop it from taking over...need a quick easier method of control.
Would this work on Mesquite trees and what chemical are you using?
Trees are never unwanted
Please any one understand what is the name of other things, I can't understand one 80% water what is the name of other thing please write the name. Thanks
Lmao...that little cut and squirt will not kill shit !
Cheap thinking

HEY DOUCHEBAG !! UH HOW about a CHAIN SAW ?? FKING MORON !! YOU W-I-L-L need one anyway when your trees are dead so you just showed the world what happens when a rubber breaks !! !! Yo mama should have learned to SWALLOW !!
Quit the lazy man's poison & just do a little more work to gird the tree.
What ' s. in that bottle:   ? ACID.  '?
Will this work on pinetrees?
Sorry, but I've recently tried this on a large tree overhanging our home- and it doesn't work.  There is not a single sign of anything dying, despite me repeating this action now several times.
What is the magic formula in the squirt bottle?
Trees can be a right pain
He is like a tree assassin.
i didnt know a thing about this, but why not cut the tree? im just curious.
I wish it was this easy for mesquite. Not so much. You cut one down and the downed trunk will root again.

Build a school trick the trees into going start your massacre
Don't kill them they are the gift of naturr
The old copper nail myth is just that: an old wive's tale. It does NOT work. Too bad this myth just won't die.
Better off cutting them down. Standing dead trees are a real safety hazard.
wasting resoures and poising the water table while you do it
What is that water
How to kill unwanted humans😁
This guy's a friggin moron. It's OK, he'll probably get cancer from using that crap.
Arsenic?  Isn't that illegal to use?  Also, it is persistent in the soil, meaning any food crops ever grown there will contain arsenic at some level.  What I use is a copper nail.  Drive the nail into the tree and it will die.
How long will it take to die
treegired
Tried this all over my property. Doesn't work with Roundup. At all.
Only things unwanted in this world are human beings
tree killer
AKA how to be a douche and spray toxic herbicide all over.
This is what happens when you can't squirt no more. Fake orgasm
Here's another way...hammer a couple copper nails into the tree.
Can the poison transfer to other trees through the roots since it’s so potent?
He's created a solution for a problem that doesn't exist , push that little tree over or cut it down?
Cruel , Hate you man......... Save trees save nature....
Will this technique work if used on a stump to prevent regrowth?
Is this donny bakers dad?
El metodo del asesino.
I don't understand how they are "undesirable trees" you are in the fucking woods.

Everyone using poison  should be punished. Trees are there in order to maintain the cycle  of life. All kind of usefull animals life in those trees. Don't waste our environment, we all depend on it for oxygen, honey etc..
F****** leave the trees alone adapt or die. One day the planets going to fight back don't matter what you do we need to I'll be spayed and neutered for at least 10 years control the population
Where can I buy this to get rid of some BIGGER trees PLEASE

Mr don't do that ,if you want wood cut it otherwise let it grow
I can barely understand what this guy is saying, people with southern accents should be deported until they learn proper English.  This is America speak American.
I need to make a video called "How to kill unwanted humans"
Can be Roundup???
Try that with a Russian Olive tree and it will laugh at you then kick your A**
You use which chemicals
the way he kills trees i think he does it a lot. I bet the first time he killed a tree he was sad. they say once you kill your first tree it gets easy the more you do it. .
The problem I always run into is whether the chemical will go down into the roots and travel to kill my desired species that I'm wanting to save. I was told that it wouldn't with remedy, when doing basil bark treatments, and found out that it killed some of my desired oaks. It's a large loss when a large desired tree dies. I assume if doing more than 1 squirt or hacking and squinting several small trees in close proximity to my desired species, may kill my desired species, when using Arsenal. Can you confirm that I am wrong? Thanks, Steve
We have a lot of big honey locusts.  I take my portable drill out with a 1" spade bit and drill 4 holes near the base at an aggressive downward angle (hint, start drilling perpendicularly into the tree and once you are in a little bit radically change the angle.  Once you have your 4 holes drilled I have a soda bottle with a piece of aquarium tubing glued to a hole in the cap.  I fill the bottle with undiluted round generic up concentrate and squirt that into the holes, and top them off every other day for about a week.  After a few days all the leaves will start to curl up and fall off.  After a week the tree will be pretty much devoid of leaves.  Top off the round up in the holes about once a week for a month.  Now you can take the tree down and get rid of the stump and you *probably* will not have hundreds of little runners popping up from the roots.  If you do not do a good job of killing off the root system, the tree will haunt you for many, many years sending up shoots everywhere along the roots.  FWIW, I can not fathom one nick and one squirt of dilute round up doing a whole lot of damage to a big tree and it's entire root system.  This does not cost a penny, but it is quick and really effective.  Also, if someone takes trees down on your property such as the utility and they cut them off a foot or so about the ground, you can do the same thing to try and kill off the roots.  Our power company took a bunch of trees down in the right of way and man what a mess we had coming out of the stumps until I killed them off good.
Is this applicabke on teak tree
Girdle instead. Almost as easy

just what is needed. how to kill even more of nature. hope the sun cooks your brains  without the trees you are helping to kill, takes years and years to grow and you come around and kill them all
Every tree plays a impotant role for nature. Don't cut it plzzzzzz....
For those that dislike the idea of killing any tree, you need to consider that the net effects of the hack and squirt method will likely be positive GAIN, not a net loss.  How is this possible? Because the extra space created for the trees left behind and the removal of competition for water, nutrients, etc. allows for the beneficial species to thrive and grow faster and larger than would otherwise be possible.  That allows the hard and soft mast producing trees to expand their mast production and thereby provide far more food for wildlife.  Also, with hack and squirt, the dead tree is left standing and creates a dead snag.  Dead snags are hosts for all sorts of wildlife for nesting and dens.  In most forests, there is a shortage of dead snags so creating more dead snag trees greatly benefits wildlife.  Overall, done correctly, selectively killing tree species that are not beneficial to wildlife or economically valuable for timber can greatly improve the forest and wildlife habitat.  Killing for the sake of killing isn't being advocated in this video.  Wise removal of unwanted species so that the net effect is a far more beneficial forest is what this video promotes.  Thanks for sharing a great video!
What kind of herbicide?
Try to plant more trees DONT KILL THEM
This guy sounds brain dead!
can you pls share the chemical name.? details of the supplier also needed.
Is this  for real?  You look and sound VERY convincing,i am inclined to believe it;   amazing,due the the minimal qty,though!
What the f***... Anybody speak English either on the video or in these f****** comments
Where can you buy arsenal herbicide? I found products that are compared to arsenal herbicide. Are they the same and as good?
This guy is a fool. Spray a tree, tell us it's dead, then expect us to believe it?
My neighbor is going to have a heart attack
George Bush's gardener xD
Awww, memories, I was with Oregon State Forestry in the 70's and we did the same method for getting rid of large hardwoods. We used a product called Torodon 101. You didn't have to wait a year like your method. We would start in the morning and when we broke for lunch, the trees we started on we already losing their leaves and had big, black stripes going up the trunk. I doubt they could get away with that now.
pleas tell witch cemikal
I tried this method using just 14% non-selective herbicide and in less than 1 week, the trees are dropping their leaves from the top down. I used a machete to cut multiple slices and then sprayed. Working great so far! Thanks for the tip! Cheers!
With many trees, you can also drill a 3/8" hole in the trunk downwards at an angle, insert a drinking straw and just keep it topped up with undiluted Roundup Concentrate, so it acts as an "intravenous drip".
Will it work against TREE OF HEAVEN shrubs and stuff???   Garbage that grows in the fence life.
will this work on black locust
https://youtu.be/EHVD3g80kt0
I didn't understand which type of liquid u used
How long does it take to completely kill the tree and all?
Wow , there are some real fruit loops out there. Some of the comments are beyond belief.
Some state parks employees actually see their job as tree guardians. We have a park which opened in the 1950's that trees have been allowed to grow unchecked and beautiful, planned vistas are gone. This is the answer.
What is the combination of the spray in the container?
why don't you just cut them down?
Will this work on Brazilian Pepper trees ?
This white/red money face man is doing Terrorist Act hate you!
Killing trees by illegally...put him in jail
Should be titled : " How to stop the production of oxygen."  People are just stupid.
Fools u cutting tree means cutting ur self .
You are poisoning the environment with toxic chemicals. Honestly, you should've just chopped it down. It's too bad that you don't appreciate trees. They are very precious gifts.

Why do you have to kill a tree? Why don’t you hack it? I tell you why. You are jealous of your neighbours mango tree, full of mangos hanging . You wish it were in your garden. So what you do? Kill it when he is not around. Some countries, local administration don’t allow you permission to hack a tree. If the tree is obstructing your display/hoarding. what you do ? Kill it. Selfish,self cantered, and people who don’t care a damn about environment do kill trees.
Y kill trees ? Try it on ur self old man. pls encourage to grow trees not to kill them. u are a social network killer encoraging people to kill trees
Now Try to grow tree in a year like that big with hack and water method
drill and drops..my method. drill hole near base. add a few drops of concentrated round up. more for larger trees.
What’s the name off the poison will I get this in uk
SUCH AN EVIL ACT ...TREES HAVE RIGHT TO LIVE...YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO KILL THEM AS IT IS AND BY THE WAY TREES ARE NOT UNWANTED IT'S PEOPLE LIKE YOU WHO DESTROY NATURE ARE HARMFULL..AND UNWANTED.
Chemical name?
that one is DEAD!
People need a tutorial on killing a tree?  Lol.   Cut a ring around the bark til you hit wood.  The end.  This is the lowest denominator channel.
Does this work with evergreens?
what is the soluition  exactly ?
There should be a Kill counter on the corner of the video.
Old man you lived your life  Now let the trees live !  What the hell are the trees doing to you ?
What is that liquid u have sprayed on tree??
George Bush showing how to kill trees

plz name the liquid u used.
really?
What's wrong with a chainsaw?
What kind of an idiot are you
All the negative comments clearly come from people who do not own their own land. There are trees that are quite a nuisance and will wreak havoc on your yard equipment. Not to mention they will also prevent the growth of desirable trees. I remove trees from my land but I also replant with trees that I want such as fruit and nut trees.
squirting 'what'...?
20 present what? Medicine
ye sprye kis chemical ka hai name kya hai
what is the stuff you are using
Copper nails work too. Drive a couple in the tree and it will die
Will thiss work on an oak?
Wheres the proof that those trees actually died.
This dude is a coldhearted killer
I haven't had good luck with this method. My best results is cutting a double ring around the tree about 4" apart 360°
Where are your gloves and eye protection?
Don't teach people how to kill trees. Trees have feelings too.
The Bob Ross of trees!
trees and weeds ar e  living things..sad to cut them down ...
Easy but horrible way just an easy way to get termites at your home leaving dead trees.
theres a stump in my back yard thats been causing trouble. i been feeding it a nice dose of gasoline with a 1/2" drill bit for years. even after that and constantly cutting the new limbs, it still says fuck you to me. what will shut it up for good?
for every one who missed the name of the chemical, I won't tell you the name but I will tell you that you can rewind the video and listen again
out here in deep country we use a chainsaw to cut them down and then have wiener roast with the wood
BAM that one's dead BAM another one
grim reaper
your a piece of shit....
Do want to borrow a pair of pruners?  They require two hands but they’ll do the job in less than a year.
I just sew him kill a oak tree
That is so unfair for other trees
hammer copper nails in tree and pour muriatic acid on it dayyyyd
I like that title! It reminds of some people I know. While they're standing there hacking up a lung, they're squirting in their pants at the same time...lol.
@ 0:10....WOW!! That stuff is fricken amazing!!!🤤 It not only kills the tree's, it removes the stumps AND it clears the land too!!! Right down to the dirt!!! Cant even tell there was even any tree's there!!...lol😅
old idiot
Many thanks just the advice I needed 👍
can you use any home items to do the same? are there any drawbacks?
How did I get here....
the best way to kill an unwanted tree is to feed it peperoni pizza made by Dominos!!!!!!!!!!!!!!     it will kill anything
Sir kea dalte hai
dont kill trees this way just cut them dont kill them because they are alive scientifically and they are cute
What else is being killed by the over spray?
Can I use pure Round-Up ( glyphosate 41%)  without any dilation for a quick result for small to medium-sized trees?
hii MossyOakGameKeepers,  You said you just mix herbicide 20 to water 80%.. that's it ?  i heard that Glyphosate is not easy to be absorb into tree ?  i heard need to mix it some soap to assist the transfer of that chemical into the tree layer.. is that it ? it is winter here.. no more leaves on any tree.. is it too late to use it on tree  ?   i need to control some irritating trees that taken over my yard.   your reply will be appreciated. thanks andrew
Squirts it on the hatchet and touches everything with the hatchet after, hope he washed his hands at least
How to kill flower tree
My Lanlord wont cut my back house no good trees so I use this method cause rats where living in them and we got infested with rats
sorrrrrry man thats not good job to kill human beings lungs and oxygen machines
That soppy cut he’s making with the axe wouldn’t make a blind bit of difference if you sprayed glysophate or something like katana in it.. bullshit video
you unwanted fellow, all trees are useful. you are unwanted for the world eco system. hate you.
Diesel soaked and then lit on fire works well....
Your lazy just chop them down
You Look Like brother of George bush
He doesn't like a heavy Hatchet because it wears his elbow? Is he trying to say the word out? O U T ? And what the hell is a akern? Does he mean Acorn?
u are whats unwanted
Please don't do this.   Cut the damn things down.  Let them dry.  Use for fire wood.
Please don't kill the trees. Just move them to another place. Trees feel pain too.
now that tree is dayyyd
what about big trees
I didn't understand what kind of herbicide to use. Can I use Roundup?
Arsenal® Applicator’s Concentrate Herbicide
I just chop the little dudes down and pile them in one spot for a refuge for wild animals.
why i would kill tree? even i need lumber i will cut it, but not kill that can't at least give it chance to grow again.
in my country u cant cut tree,  its crime same as u killed human
and that tree's day-ed
I didnt get the chemicals he used ? Anyone?
Fucking neighbor he killed my family tree with this technic >:(
how can I stop a strings Berry tree from growing once cut as affecting my chest
Another Dawg wood Heair,,Dawgonit,!
what's a good strong herbicide to use with this hack and squirt method?
plant tree much as you can..... dont kill it idiot
Shame on you
I like trees.
i can be like a assassin killing trees. do my shoes laces up, hack spray walk away no one seen anything.
Tree lives matter!
Seams so cruel to poison a tree, and it takes a year for it to die. I believe that if anything must be killed it should go as fast as possible and preferably painless, but I don't know if/how trees perseve pain?
Should you be wearing gloves ?
Will this work on Russian olives? The Colorado river is infested with them so much so that they are listed now as invasive. Not long ago the forest service had actually promoted them.
*Kills animals*  Gets judged by others *Kills trees* Gets judged by others  And this, ladies and gentlemen, is why you should not care about what others think about what you do.  Unless... u know... if ur doing something morally wrong.  But yet again some people consider eating animals "morally wrong"
Forest mismanagement
He sounds like tree trunks
How to kill what? A tree? How to kill a tree? LOL! Lumbers are murderers now!
Hickory nuts.
Cool I already trimmed some of my neighbors lovely trees with this new method I would certainly use it. Thanks for the video
I wonder how long it takes to die ??
Stop being lazy and just cut it down
There was a time in earth history when everything was made use of not just killed, today we manage nature as we would cattle, thinning out underbrush using fire has been A tool of forrestry for sometime.but some trees need fire for reproduction. Interesting way to kill unwanted trees, like weeds using "Roundup".....
This guy is a serial tree killer! 🌲🔫🌳🌴🔫
Yeah... Bullshit. I have trees that would spit in your face for annoying them like that. I have trees that have had gallons of glyphosphates dumped onto them only to see them come back stronger the next year. I have trees that I cut off at ground level and the stumps grow right back into mature trees within 2 years.  The only tress I have that die easily are the ones I want to keep.
That's gone die
Please share what you used to spray on the trees. If you have the link from where you purchase it please provide.
The judges in Seattle wont have to have their "help" "mistakenly" cut down trees in adjacent parks anymore.
FREE THE TREES.... STOP THE KILLING... FREE THE DAM TREES.....
Ah, I don't think so.
it can be efficient against Ailantus?
Wow!!! Surely I will try... At least if it works am not gonna going to clean my neighbor tree leave... Ha ha ha...
Any advise on how to kill an Idiot?
we should spray you with some, idiot.your video sucks.
Where do I buy that particular  herbicide
Apparently, Arsenal is a trade name for imazapyr.
Qual o motivo de matar essas árvores? Elas estão invadindo o lugar das árvores nativas?
arsonal herbaside?  that is the active ingredient?  right . can you recomend a good one to use specifically for cedars and black locus?
with electric saw all those takes less than 10 minutes to cut..Long life .if you were north korean kim jon un will panish you for that.haha
what are u putting in the bottle to kill the trees you didn't say you just said pesticides  what kind
...so he is killing them softly. Lot of agony .He is a passionate criminal. Ecosystem lose his job. Sad story.
Will this kill the adjacent tree?
The most stupid thing I ever saw.
YOU TREE MURDERER!!!!
The tulip tree is not actually part of the poplar family
This shit does not work .its gonna take a lot more than that you fucking moron
isn't this illegal in some states?
Cutting the tree down works better. Poison is bad
There are no unwanted trees, but assholes in the wrong place
Yayyuh. I lack ta cut trees an such, wiff one lil he-it.
Some of the trees you kill are elder then you
What weed killer would you put in the spray bottle
2-4D works just as well $40 for a 2 1/2 gallon jug
Critique yourself before you criticize others that know what they are doing🖕🏿
how much time does is take to kill the tree?
Does it work on pine trees?
a poisened Forest will grow better Trees?  Trees are conected by their rootsystem, they share nutrients.  If you poison some of them it will affect all others around too.
"That one is dead"
What does Paul perrette look like nowadays
which chemical he use in the spray??   is it avialabe on ebay UK? would it work on unwanted gard shrubs,bamboos, would it burn their root systems as well, so they dont grow back....
what is that  the poison?
one little hit. . . squirt, thats gonna die
squirrels eat hickory nuts
Or a chainsaw maybe a little better than spraying poison throughout the forest
Yea that's gonna DIE!
Are chainsaws not sold in your area???
This is misuse of poison in my opinion.  A small crosscut saw would remove those trees with very little effort.  Cogongrass or other highly invasive species may require herbicide, but using it in this application is just laziness.  Poor stewardship of our Mississippi woodlands.
or you can just chop it down
you chop it down with axe or a chainsaw, I,stead of lazily poisoning the trees
murderer
no tree is unwanted...sad and angry
but, wont the venom poison the crossing roots of the good tree ?
I didn't understand the solution that you are using, and where can I get some?
It's day-ed. Done n kil tit.
Why the hell you are killing trees? This video may lead to kill many trees. You idiot!
Can't you sell the poplar to loggers? I heard somewhere you can get good money if you have enough of them.
This is a waste of time.
Whaaaaaaat?what are you doiiiing?
I'm not a hippie but going around and poisoning a fucking forest for "pennies" so you can get just the plants you want is vile.  Why don't you put in the hard work of actually cutting it.  At least you can appreciate the hundreds of years of growth that went into that forest.  We are a pathetic species, humans.  All for money.
tree is our lief
don't make this type of video
which herbicide we have to use ?
Shooting them would be more humane,spare the babies of course.
I think you should wear gloves when using that spray!
this is bullshit do this here where I live u get a big fine also make no sense just cut them diwm
Will that kill palms
A caution near a house..... the tree will deteriorate limbs fall and in time the entire tree will fall.
Doesn't this man know about the dangers of herbicides? Clearly not.
i know its been said before but why not just cut it down
Any idea how to kill unwanted game keepers
The horror of ignorance. 'They's daiyed' when $ = value above nature we all live in 'haiyell'. There's a wasp that sits at the edge of an Australian native gum & droppings from that wasp serves as nutrient to microflora in the soil at the tree's rootrim. Boring when you can hack n squeeze all day for muhuhuhunny!
Y'all talk so fast nobody knows what the hell you're saying! What the Sam hell y'all spraying on ''em damn trees to kill 'em anyway? Chemicals are a waste of money & ain't good for y'all either, piss on 'em? Dats rite, piss on 'em! Hell! My Pit Bull pissed on & round 8 trees. Dey all died.
does this work on pine trees?
What specifically is this Herbacide and where can we get it?
What was the herbicide he used ? .
I'd like to know what he has in that spray bottle.  It must be some pretty potent stuff because glyphosate typically won't work on a tree that size.
What kind of roundup? Thx
silly method just cut it down
just curious as was once a logger why are you killing popular and hickory both have value as lumber and hickory is great as a food source for wildlife with the nuts just as much so as oak. Just seems like there is a lack of knowledge here about trees.
How long will it take for that tree to die if it is greened up this time of year??
Get a chainsaw, make firewood.
Why not just cut those little suckers down
Any chance Aresenal works on bamboo? If not, can any of you Aggies help this T-sip out?
What is liquid made of Tree killer ?
What is the name of the spray?
Can you do this anytime? Or doesn't it matter.
It is hard to believe that a few hacks and a couple of sprays will kill a tree.Am I wrong??
Would this work on some very large and invasive grape vines?
man thank you so much
I have some large Poplar trees in my yard and I can't afford to have them cut.  If I use this method and they die will the limbs die and fall from the top or will it cause the whole tree to fall over?
who died and made you God? to decide who should live and who should die.  oh  sorry  I didn't notice you are an American that explains it
should be criminally charged.
Tree + Husqvarna = stump
*Triggered*
That's kingdomist.
horrible tree killer
Well it isn't like those create oxygen or anything.
what kind of herbicide are you using ? Round Up ? Killzall ? Glyphosate ? or  Brush be gon ? Triclopyr ? a 20% Herbicide & 80% water mix right .
Will this work on Bush Honeysuckle?
what is that stuff
How long before the leaves start to fall off?
If you are really serious... :-)   http://www.forestry-suppliers.com/product_pages/Products.asp?mi=63481&itemnum=21002&redir=Y
What fluid user
Would this work on Huisache trees?
Can you use round up or something besides arsenic?
Come on now..You need a license in the USA too for any chemical that is so required...Second glysophate is Roundup!
You tell it it was a mistake and you were just a sperm donor and you dont want anything to do with it.. thats one way for it to kill itself. 🙄
To control some elms, hackberries, and honey-locusts on my property, I'm having better luck using a 20% glysophate solution (cut 41% concentrate with equal amount of water).  I add a drop of Basic H to a quart (surfactant).  But instead of hacking, I carry a battery powered drill and drill a 3/8" about half an inch deep at a 45 degree angle.  That puts more of the solution in contact with a greater amount of vascular tissue.  With the hack method, I was getting less than 20% control rate.  With the drill method I'm getting a near 100% control rate.  This also seems to prevent the bad problem of honey-locust root suckers forming.  It helps if the trees are experiencing a period of high evapotranspiration rates.
Love his accent.
that is a very serious poison if i little squirt will kill a large tree
if i recall the defoliant is agent orange.
how do you know whether the oak and other timber producing trees need the other species in order to live ? mabye they add chemicals to the soil to aid the growth of timber trees, or pesticides to remove fungi and insects. would you kill a juniper or a bay laurel?
Whatsis in the  Bottel
For the time you took it would seem to me that you could get much quicker and better results by just carrying around a small chain saw, jobs done.
Would Round-up be effective too?
Any suggestions for stopping the invasive roots? I don't want to kill the whole tree. I think they are poplar but their roots extent hundreds of feet from the tree. I have a pole shed with trees sprouting in it from these roots and sprouts all over the yard.
Where are your rubber gloves or don't you think you are immune to the effects of Arsenal???
What is the herbicide that you use?
What chemicals he useing??~
the vegans will be mad
Too bad this wouldn't work on yucca tree/shrubs as well.  I've chopped yuccas down to stumps and painted the stump with full strength total vegetation killer, and the damn things will come back in a year, resprouting from the roots.  Hate yuccas...
happy uplifting music playing in the background* now, it's gonn' die :^)
What chemical did he used?
would this work for a stump that has massive suckers?
I think this whole post is suspect...someone just misinforming people looking for way to kill a tree so they DON'T kill it...I would have to see it to believe it myself...
using the famed copper nail logic I once tried to kill a tall palm tree by boring a steeply down slanted auger hole at the tree's base and filled it with a bunch of tiny pieces of pure copper wire and then filled it with acid thinking that would get a bunch of copper in it and kill it...guess what?  Tree could have cared less as though nothing ever happened...  I have a bunch of tree's I NEVER ought to have planted that are consuming my world now!  I let them go and now I have a HUGE problem!  Just paid $1000 to have only ONE cut down not even counting the stump!!!  I love trees.  I just wish they would stay a certain size and not destroy everything!!!!  And block ALL sunlight!!
Why not a Dogwood? Religiois reasons?
This old cow is just waste of air. Since he is killing trees that we need to have clean air for. But his old self needs to stop breathing up the oxygen
killer
how to kill tree  1 buy gasoline 2soak tree in gasoline 3 set it on fire
How to kill a tree : 1) get gun 2) shoot tree 3) tree dead
Niffy I've got oodles of scrub trees. I've been cutting them off, but they come back with multi branches at the cut off. Going to try this method, thank you.
so u just kill the tree, and let it rot to it fall by its self?.. and what if a deer feat from the poisoned part of the tree ?.
What is the 20% called arsenol herbicide?
This guys voice
why not just cut it down right away... ?
you are killer
Cool i found a new cheap way to piss of my neighbors
Can you give me a link where to buy that stuff? Thanks.
how long for the tree to die?
What chemical mix are you using to kill these unwanted trees?
They make this really cool tool called a chainsaw.  It works without having to poison the trees and thus the system.  Check one out.
Name of mixture again.....please and thank you 👍🏼
would round up work for the spray??  tough to get good chemicals up here in Canada without a license.
