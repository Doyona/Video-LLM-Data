Although presented in a casual manner, Izzy's words are carefully chosen and there isn't a lot of useless verbiage as there are with some. The viewer needs to listen carefully as there is a lot of good advice and tips in his videos.
that knife will ricochet off that wall faster than you can blink. If you think your safe cause its goin to fly away.   might be wrong.
Hi Izzy, very good, informative, well captured and demonstrated. Easy to understand  .... thanks very much for the video. 👍.
Great Wood Video
I want to purchase it can you teel me abut price.
Great video thanks for sharing your talent 😃
Do you have a source for the Diamond Dust you use? Thank you.
I got those on order `paper wheels’ but they advised to get a slower speed grinder to control the heat. I certainly want to try this method. Looks great and fast.
It wasn't so long ago, you would have actually shown us how you made the wheels. All the other information seems like nonsense without it.
Plz say brother were it is available
The mechine were it is available plz give information
Plz I want that mechine were it is available
Do you make your cardboard wheels. If so can you make a video showing us how?
what are the grits on the both wheels? or equivalent grits ?
Where did you get the cardboard that   THI CK
Where did you get the cardboard app back
$86 plus shipping.
Where can you buy diamond dust only ?
My wife's kitchen knives 😂. Those are mine, she doesn't cook, I do. Also I wouldn't give her a razor sharp knife, she would cut herself to the bone! She could cut herself on a butter knife.
The diamond dust, is that silicon carbide? If so, what grit? (I’ve seen 60 to 180 grit). Thanks
👍Nice. Thx. (SUBd)
That is silicon carbide, not diamond
I use my chisels to cut nails and throw like a knife
My tools are not sharp but they're still scary.
Cool video. But PLEASE!!!  You never EVER sharpen a chisel from both sides. You just slightli strop it on the flat side
Damn! I need a small workshop!
can somsone please answer me this question, what the hell is diamond dust. ive googled all day and cant find anything close to what this guy has
You're a funny guy...
Izzy Swan I am flabbergasted with your ability to sharpen tools. I’ve been figuring out where to sharpen garden tools, and nobody knows. Thanks for your video I now know how to sharpen them. Please more clarity in the direction of the wheel.  Thanks you very much.
I have an 8” grinder but I only see grinding wheels for 6” grinders.  Does it matter?  Can I use the 6” grinder wheel in my 8” bench grinder?   Thanks
I love my wheel kit👍🏼
I have MDF 8" wheels from a project an old grinder...all I need the diamond dust/was/compound. Do you know where buy just the dust, wax and compound??
Will this work ell with Turning Gouges for a lathe ???
How do u make the disc
Very well done.  Thanks
Could you do a video with kitchen knives Chrs
Are you okay now?

Hey mate thanks from down under
Thank you for not shaving your arm hair. I get so tired of seeing that done to demonstrate how sharp something is. You did it right.
I love mine. Super sharp, super fast. Interesting... the owner recommends just a tiny bit of wax (for cooling) at the beginning of sharpening (seriously- check with Customer Service). I've done it both ways.    If I had unlimited space and unlimited grinders, I'd but their leather strip stropping wheel too.    Such a great sharpener.
Impressive
Wow. Not at all like other videos demonstrating the same system.  But yours makes more sense and I can see the mistakes the others made.
By the way if someone tries this system and it doesn't work well, it's not the fault of the system.  Some blades just cannot be sharpened.  Some can be razor sharp and some won't cut paper.   Believe it or not the Ozark knives from Walmart usually have great steel.  At least at the moment.
excellent little garage set up.. two things I thought you should have mentioned one you touched on was angel the different 15 and 35 degree angles of a knife blade.. one (15 degrees) to be the sharpes but doesn't hold the best edge long.. it stays sharp but loses some of it the best sharpness faster and the 35 degree bevel which is sharp but not as sharp as the 15.. but will hold that sharpness longer.. it is a small matter as the way you sharpen your blades with this system will give you what you need.. the second was to explain to novices that you were not putting a bevel on the back side of the chisel blade you were just removing the burs the backside of a chisel must be flat.. remember  there may be noobs watching.. I like your set up ( I always just use a razor strap.. it is what I have used for 40 years now.. you know old dogs) I am thinking I might just set up a sharpening station like this one..I am impressed with your results. your very skilled... what about sharpening drill bits with this system? oops I see this was done in 2016.. it is 2018 almost 9 now.. I will have to find you site and ask...
I've never seen anybody put the flat edge of a chisel on the grinder, always the beveled edge.
Some really good tips there Man! Thanx.
Where do you get cardboard wheels
Where do get the cardboard wheels? What is the manufactures name?
Or just use sandpaper
How about the grinder link?
I would get a butchers knife and over sharpen it down to a wicked spike
Good for a quick edge... sure. People like me won't use these on their favorite knives. Those wheels at that speed get the edges of those knives incredibly hot in an instant. Its the last few microns of the edge that do the cutting, and that thin bit of steel loses temper hardness very quickly.    Diamond dust? I am pretty sure that is SiC pouder... unless they have changed the system.
I have the cardboard wheel and use it but a better system for knives is the RealSharp system.  I have had folks come to me to sharpen their knives after having their blades almost ruined by Bass Pro using this system.  I mainly use your system for carving tools.
Have you ever heard 3 body sword. Is a sword so sharp it can make a clean cut. Through 3 human body is bone and all. With almost no effort at all. Now that's Sharp. But even that is not scary sharp.  You need to stop using stupid terms that are not true. Just to make it katie title. In hopes someone will watch your video. If your videos are that bad. Stop making them.
I always dress my hobby knives and scalpels with a diamond lap. Generally the Eze-Lap  brand. But I'm only cutting foam and balsa. ;¬)
diamond stones around 320 & 1000 grit levels or between with balanced sharpenings doesn't require machines to make knives the scary sharpest,knife sharpening machines won't make knives the scary sharpest because of the stress levels they add to knives,you still made a good video & liked your video though,keep up the good work,but still knife sharpening machines won't make knives the scary sharpest,i kind of like the diamond stone & belt the best,they make knives the scary sharpest because of the right sharpenings needed without stresses from knife sharpening machines or other knife sharpeners,the best diamond stones & belts are needed to make knives the scary sharpest that requires specific touch ups.
Is that scary sharp? You didn't test the knife. That system is good but sharpening stone and a leather strop works better for me.
Video is great. But what is diamond dust ??? I can’t find it any where!!! Can you please leave a brand or different name. Or amazon page or place where I can find it?!?!? Lol
what are you put on the wheel to made the knife sharp.  i would like to order one.
Pro tip: to get the best life out of that diamond dust, you need to keep the wheel and the knife cool, if it gets hot, the carbon in the diamonds will dissolve into the steel reducing the life of the diamonds. This also causes the carbon content in the edge of your blade to rise, making it more like cast iron: harder, but more brittle and harder to sharpen later.
Nice one sir ;-)
thank you. great system. thanks for sharing.
Learning to use my art nib for my potatoes 🥔 currently lol thank you for the great tips!
i am fed up of buying knife sharpiners that dont work i just got this one off amazon hope it works
or just by a chefs choice sharperner. Wow
What purpose does the leather serve?
Since when do you touch the FLAT side of a chisel to a WHEEL?  If there's a burr on the flat side you hone the chisel on a FLAT stone, and not on a wheel.
broadheads?
Damn your dust collection system is nice
Keeping cutting tools sharp is not inexpensive, and sending them out to get done is not cheap either.  What is the cost?
Any body know where you would buy Diamond dust
I have the razors edge system and love it when it works.  I was told in the instructions I have to use the wax to apply the diamond dust.  I wish I had know about the wood glue before.  Thank you for that tip.
Really nice video with very good editing. Thank you very much!!
Izzy, I love you're Chanel and all you're awesome builds, but I was wondering if you Had any videos to learn from that isn't so advanced with all the fancy table saws and knife sharpeners and stuff, just the basic circ saw jig saw hammer and some screws etc
Great vid. Is it necessary to clean off the wheels and how? Mine are black and smooth with constant use ans compound application. ATB from the UK.
The Art Of Weapons have this original idea.

Hi mate.. I live in Australia.. Was wondering what type of store would have that card board..!!!..to make that wheel..and also where would one purchase the diamond dust to glue to the wheel... Regards TONY..!!.🇦🇺
Sharpening stuff is all about getting the correct angle. If you have the angle down, any good whetstone will do– no need to buy and reverse a grinder and cup diamond dust in your hand etc etc. If you’re not confident with the angle… get a good whetstone and practice. Or give your knives to someone who sharpens knives for a living. Also, if you sharpen your chisels like that, you’ll get mortises like that.
I picked up this system some years ago for around 20 bucks at a knife show. The abrasive you glue on is silicon carbide. The wheel already came with the abrasive on it, but it wears quickly depending on how much wax you apply. I hooked up a foot pedal for the motor and run the wheels away from the operator as you do. With practice you will feel when the edge bevel is matched to the proper angle on the wheel. You can also draw degree angle lines on the side of the wheel for reference.
i like the knife its like a gaffing knife
when i bought my wheels they were named OSO Sharp
#ChiselDrop
Lawl if it chips then i guess you know not to make it paper thin when you sharpen it. JSing
A PESAR DE LAS LIMITANTES DEL IDIOMA, SUS CONSEJOS SON DE GRAN IMPORTANCIA Y UTILIDAD. UN SALUDO DESDE COLOMBIA. GRACIAS POR COMPARTIR CONOCIMIENTO. ( HARRY)
where can I buy this wheel ?? ty
can i use those wheels on a 6 inch bench grinder
I was waiting for the dance
Do you clean the object you are sharpening between compounds to avoid cross contamination?
Wow, I really admired the way you'd cut this mortise, great!
ive got an older knife.  ive gotten the blade sharp itself. But the tip is still pretty blunt.   Any pointers?
l
I make do with a BladeMedic (I don't use the tungsten calm down) and call it a day - I have no idea how valid these types of videos are but they're always great fun to watch.
The commentary is priceless.. Nothing better than watching someone who knows what they are doing with a good attitude.  Much success -OttO
How often should you load up your wheels for sharpening .
nice.
Why am I watching this ?
bench grinder on the job! in the woods! in my boat! ....Day! Dook! D'our! Dobs!
I love the cardboard idea. I worked for years as a Luthier repairing, modifying and restoring guitars. A friend of mine (who originally taught me) built a whole electric guitar out of what was essentially stabilized corrugated cardboard and a CNC machine. He built the body as a Tele. Bolted a Fender replacement neck, installed all the factory hardware, pickups/switches & pots. I was amazed at how good it sounded. I mean, it didn't sound JUST like a Tele and it did have less sustain and resonance, but no where near what I would have thought.  *Yes, this has absolutely nothing to do with this video except the material, just thought it was cool.
Can ypu get it laser Ludacris charp?
good video thorough demonstration
THANKS!
I have the same system, I scavenged it from a dumpster!
its best done with a grinding wheel and a leather honing wheel at 23ish degrees, untuil you can see a corce edge running the knife, the honing it all off both edges evenly
Great to watch this, but with 46 different size and curved chisels yehhhhhhh it would get kinda tricky to sharpen it, but for the flat chisels? Thanks!!  BUT as a dutch guy, cardboard? do you mean Medium Density Fiberboard (MDF) or (HDF) ?
thanks for sharing
Say it like Russian hacker:kids do not try this at home!
Great job Izzy
You allow your wife to use the best kitchen knives!?! :o)
cool video thanks! So, where would I go to buy the materials I need for this like the diamond dust The wax? also, what is the purpose of the leather strap? thanks again
this is the first video of yours I've seen. I've been looking for a better sharpening system that's man. you just earned your self a subscriber
can you do this with folders would they have alot of force on the lock and end up cutting you?
Izzy good vid. been doing this for a long time;l just right.
can i sharpen a machete
as long i can cut a slice of bread and sausage iam good with it.
Does this method heat up the steel significantly?  Thanks
Where can I get the disc wheel
How thick do you have those round sanders?
3:09 He secretly flipped of the viewers
Bruh - you look like Negan before the zombie apocalypse (with a bit of a fast food addiction - no offense).  Nice.  Thanks for the vid!
You should Give a look at schotch wheels
x
Como no afilar un formón . Nunca afilen un formón en la parte plana !! Por algo es plana !!!
Where do you get the cardboard wheels and compounds ? Charlie
"That said, (SMIRK) let's sharpen some chisels."  I really enjoy your sense of humor.
cant I just cut out my own MDS disks and coat it ?
I use this system for my wood carving gouges.  Works great.
As a person whose had to watch countless videos on how to get a knife razor sharp only to find out that they're using a wood guide, this is nice, the fast for ward part is nice too, keeps the video being 20+ minutes long
They use this to polish jewelry.
Dang he is fast XD WOW
diamond dust? looks more like silicon carbide coated on a cardboard wheel , I was foolish to buy a wheel only to find out you can never true it since its only one layer of abrasive,
love the enthusiasm
hej izzy just came accros your video you look a cool guy man take care 👍
This is why ISIS are getting more kills
instructions unclear got my dick stuck in a Swiss army knife
Are diamond dust actually diamond dusts?
Awesome demo! Slicing that leather made my skin crawl. Man, that is sharp!
cool!!!
lol
love the honest approach to sharpening, no bs just straight to the point (no pun intended)
Why all the crafters look like this
Its better for a knife to be sharp than be dull.
What about larger knives, like machetes or even short swords?
I love that SOG. Mine has been awesome
Just a old stone from the 40s and oil on my knifes.
where did you get your strop?
Nicely done!......Thanks for the informative video.
doesn't sharpening things on grinders ruin the temper on blades and chisels?
Can I sharpen my teeth with this?
Nice
can it sharpen a pencil?
so remember if you want a sharp knife ...you need to sharpen the knife
This is awful... It's crazy how sharp these knifes can get. There needs to be knife control! Think of the kids!
i love wacthing your video its boring but i like it ahhahaha
Can you sharpen broad heads with it?
issa knife
5:20 - 5:42 So satisfying :s
I guess if the board is the width of the chisel... maybe, but you do not sharpen chisels that way ...
this guy uses human leather
how many strops you use a year? lol

What would be the best option for sharpening a knife for someone who gets burned easily and is a beginner
all that diamond dust. this guy must be rich!
.
The fast-mo mortise cutting was great.  Every homeowner (imo) needs three sets of chisels: a crap set when you might find a knot, staple or nail (or for plywood) a decent set for most days, and a fine set of very hard steel that you keep pristine.  I think your example is sufficient for sets one and two...again, imo.
This is a good method but it's not the best, because the knife can get hot and then if it gets too hot it becomes soft
Keep a glass of ice water next to the grinder and dip the blade, and then dry the blade, after each pass and it will give you a hardened edge that will last longer on your premium steels like Boler M390, S30V, etc..
Goodbye blade tempering.
awesome great job
WOW!!!!!! Awesome job and Great Wood Work
you, Sir, are a master of video editing
6:00 satisfying
So?  What is the meaning of this if the steel used on the knife can't maintain this sharpness?
call me ignorant but where can I buy a grinder like that?
very entertaining
how much did the wheels cost you
Isn't it super dangerous to be handling diamond dust withought gloves or a respirator??
thank you Izzy
I use japanese waterstones - there´s nothing better than hand sharpening. I use them for my knifes as well as for my straight razors. I use only straight razors for shaving. I start with a 400 (JIS), then 1000, 2000, 3000, then a natural 5000 and a final 8000 polish.   With the 1000 grid knives are already sharper than those of 99% of people.  I could shave even with my chisels with which I stop sharpening at 3000 grid.
Hi There. Can the diamond particles be changed to Aluminium oxide grit?
ok so that why my friend uses the side of the wheel for shsrping his chisel
Are they cardboard or MDF?  Looks like MDF in the video.
Nice way to sharpen. I use a series of wet stones then a leather buffer, works great for me
fat
how much diamond dust costs thoe ??
How often do you have to dress the wheels?
There's a 28000 machine that makes dove tails for you right?
when is it gonna be available again in amazon
Have you tried it for gravers?
jack the ripper would enjoy this video.
That slow mo tho
Currently out of stock
what white compound did you use please? great vid also....
Impressive.  Most impressive.
Who thought the chisel part was relaxing
Make a butter knife sharp
Now I can finally cut up my victi - I mean, I can finally whittle better.
I have an SOG Bi-Poler pocket knife
I would agree with the comment below about the speed up on the video. Well played.  I have seen and watched so many videos on sharpening and honing and this one was almost the best I've seen. It wasn't too long, not too short. There wasn't any info I felt was left out. Nicely done. THANK YOU!
Where do you get cardboard wheels
Did you grind the flat of the chisel? I've always been taught to not touch that side besides maybe one quick pass on the stone just to take the bur off,but overall trying to evenly flatten the flat side,never just the tip
Breath don't stop breathing
What's the make and model of the grinder?
Good job on that video mate !
what does the leather do?  just clean it?
Can I use this method too sharpen my Karambit? If so can you make a video sharpening one so I can see the proper sharpening pattern.
Tf was up with the slow mo knife opening?
The speed editing on this video was really well done- It actually made the video even more interesting to watch. Great Video
Erm... I never watch these kinds of videos and this is in my recommended list... weird... but I think Yandere-Chan would love this tutorial.
In theory, you should only sharpen a chisel on the beveled side, not the flat side
it makes me so happy to see channels that educate people be popular.
Was that a butterfly chisel?!?
As with all cutting tools from saw blades to razors you want an edge for the task. This looks very good for fine edges although I use a flat diamond dust sharpening plate (eBay) and a piece of folded newspaper to give a fine edge.
This and a leather belt sander also works great.
Wow
Just found your channel and really enjoy it! Great video!
I just sharpen my pocket knife with a pair of scissors...
you just earned a new subscriber. very cool video and sweet tips. peace from scotland.
who else is watching this cuz of the clowns
it will not stay sharp if you dont cool it down even more during the sharpening do to the fact that in the fine cutting edge will lose its hardning.
That's Cool and I work hard to keep my knife sharp
tem
Why is it that I can get a perfect grind on the right face of a blade but muck up the left? Any tips would be appreciated.. I'm using a 5 inch valve grinder with very limited movement: I just answered my own question. Love the idea of turning the bench grinder around to throw the work away.. Really cool video.. Learn something everyday. Thanks sir.
What about  v tools izzy???
I try to avoid sharpening the bottom of a chisel, I think they cut better when that stays a machined surface.
have anyone tried green compound ?
I've tried a number of sharpening systems for kitchen knives, chisels, pocket knifes and utility blades.  Right now I'm using a 1"x30" belt sander followed by jewelers rouge on a felt wheel.  The investment was about $50 using my existing bench grinder.  I'd like to hear from those more experienced if I should go to some other system.  I really like the system in this video.
Where can I find the diamond dust? Is it real diamond in the dust or is it glass?
Is not better to putt first the wax and then the diamond powder to grab it  ?
Do not sharpen with cutting edge up into wheel. Blade must be edge down. It will chunk it into your stomach. My brother in law did it
Firefox isn't allowing me to connect to your website.
how many watts and what size wheels for grinder please
But not everyone has one of these
I've never thought of turning the grinder around Thank You. I have one rock mounted on a shaft that will work well on My mini metal lathe.
Thank you soo much
Excellent video thanks
awesome
I just use a wet belt sander 600 and finish with a cork belt
How are the wheels made?
Took cabinet making class 20 years ago. There was an old guy teaching us on how to sharpen tools. If done right, it could literally shave hairs off your arm with ease. I still can sharpen tools to shave hairs off your arm.
Great video.... Thanks for information  Tim
I have been trying to sharpen my knives with a Spyderco sharpmaker with no results. this is the way to go Im thinking. I have access to a grinder like this but ill have to buy a wheel like yours. Can anyone point me in the right direction? thanks for the video.
IZZY YOU ARE THE MAN NICE VID BUT HOW DID YOU MAKE THE CARDBOARD WHEELS ?????????????? THANKS LEAPLINK
since you now have cnc you can paste glue cardboard and make your own wheels! LUCKY!
you made the chisel purists cry so hard they didn't see how well it worked. now I don't feel so bad about my harbor freight plastic diamond sharpener, my nicholson chisels and my sandpaper LOL cause I get damn nice mortises real fast
what is the best easiest way to sharpen my kitchen knives? (i can't build something like this)
💪
where do you get the motor from?
I still prefer sharpening stones. Much better control.
Strange.  $58 on Amazon.com and $534 on Amazon.ca.
yeah...everyones got allll that,lol
😡😡😡😡😡😡
YEEEES, I found your channel again after my youtube with your subscription got hacked! Finally! Seems like you've changed a lot in the last year or so, donut, glasses, bigger channel!
What was the chisel you used?
What grit size of diamond dust?
I am wondering, can you make those wheels yourself from MDF or LDF ???
This is neat.Thank you for sharing.
Surprised to see that when reversing direction on the strop, you turn the edge under. Doesn't this tend to turn the edge you just honed ?
Excellent tip about keeping one finger on the blade while you sharpen it.  Such a simple thing but I have never heard anybody say this before yet it makes very good sense to do so in order to prevent overheating of the blade.  That is probably the biggest danger when sharpening tools.  Once that metal is overheated then it has to be re-tempered and unless you really know what you are doing you are not going to get it back to factory tempering :(  Great stuff, cheers.
I've sharpened and polished to a glass knives using a single piece of super fine grit water sand paper stuck to the side of an MDF wheel. The wheel's edges were tapered. Works the same only you do this with water and patience, end result is a mirror finish that inhibits rust and makes for easy sharpening (if you leave your edge normal, if you don't, then you cannot sharpen the blade with simple tools, it just skates over).
What a great tip! I'm putting those on that junk harbor freight grinder I never use TODAY!
This system is pretty close to what some factories (Buck, for example) use for sharpening. There's no reason that the wheels have to spin backwards, though. Just angle the knife down instead. Either way, always make sure there are no fingers in front of that blade, especially when working down to the tip, as that's when they are most prone to catching in the wheel.  For re-edging a damaged blade, it works well to first use a belt sander with a grit between 180 and 400 depending on how much reshaping needs done.
Looks good but where do you get the cardboard wheels ? And diamond dust and cost cheers ant from Wales uk
I love the idea of turning the grinder around. I was thinking about missing with the wiring to get mine to turn the other way.  Thank you for the great tip.
I would have liked to hear about the leather sharpener. Do you just go buy it ready made?
Video was great! Thanks. By the way........cutting the mortise shows what a craftsman really is.
What are you talking about, that mortise is beautiful! The first time I tried to chop one, the wood exploded.
my dad got me some of these wheels 5 or 6 years ago.he had been using them for 5 or 6 years before that. this is the only to go. super sharp knifes all the time. the only problem is your friends find out and they want you to sharpen their knifes
Bottom of a tea cup... That sa nuff.
I've never seen this method before but it looks great. I generally use different stones or different grit paper laid on a flat steel plate but this gives me lots of ideas, thanks I always enjoy the videos and get something new from them.
Ok, you are the only woodoworker I know crazy enough to truly ponder this question: Is it possible / feasible to cut a mortise with a sharpened chisel attachment to an air-hammer? lol. Just curious. I don't plan on doing this, your video just made me think about it.
Always useful stuff for the average enthusiasts. Thanks.
Good video.
Did you put the diamond dust on both wheels?  Where did you get the cardboard wheels?
what is the use of the last leather process?
Would MDF work in place of those cardboard wheels?
holy crap, that looks like it works well!  I imagine since it doesn't actually grind that it doesn't loose the flat on the back of the chisel?
Great inexpensive knife sharpening.  I love my Tormek. Just saying
By catching up I mean going through your previous vlogs. 🇬🇧
Hi Izzy, I've only just found your channel and I must admit it and you are fantastic, you are so innovative with your projects and thinking outside the box I try to do the same. Anyway many thanks for the things you come up with, I have a lot of catching up to do. 👍🇬🇧
I have been using this system for years, wouldn't be without it.. fast and clean.
Hi Izzy, what size grit is the diamond powder?
Cool video Izzy.  I'd love to see a follow-up video where you show how you made the cardboard wheels.
On the chisels I have seen several pros on sharpening they never sharpen the flat side just the top angle. Good video.
So cool. I'm going to have to seriously consider this system.
You have conquered the law of the blade grasshopper lol 😄, thank god for screws & glue mate, always take your tips on board & thank you for them 👍🏻
Interesting grinding circles. Great sharpening tool. Like!
Hi Izzy, where can I get the 'diamond dust' and whats it called? can't find it on ebay
izzy cool tip .
Highly informative Izzy. keep it up
Great vid izzy
I bought one about 25/30 years ago when I say it came with two disks all i had was a 6" grinder and i needed an 8 inch so i built a couple to make do out of washing machine motors they worked fine and are kicking around some where got a double shaft motor and it works just great just got to remember what side i am using and what direction the pad is what is am using i have replaced them several times and am still using them to this day I use pumice as my media and the white polisher it also works great for dressing up a 1911 stainless steal slide and and other parts if you want it shiny
Really sharp
Sweet, hadn't seen this system in use yet, thanks! 🤓
Cool method
great!! loving these tips!
Will take my drill, the ball bearings from the last lathe build and add a MDF wheel with compound to try the method. Thanks for sharing.
I am not afraid to say.....I love you :-)
Hey izzy what ever happen to that not a pantorouter concept that you were playing with it happened about a year ago. Just wondering if I missed the video or did you ever do anything with it
I have never seen cardboard wheels like that............Pretty darn slick!
pretty cool. Learned something new. Thanks.
My Grandfather was a cabinet maker.  He had sharp chisels, and I remember seeing him many times with bandaged hands to cover the stitches from those sharp chisels.
IZZY! Look at the lens brother.
i finished my chisel on the wheel and it made a sizable camber.
approx how long do the wheels last? I guess that is subjective to amount of use... but I am wondering for someone who uses them professionally like you months? years?
MDF disks mounted on the lathe work identically & cost nothing but scraps.  I just use white buffing compound, the same as used for buffing turnings.
This must be good, you're the second YouTuber to post a video about this system today.
I just use MDF wheels. One loaded with black and one loaded with Blue compound. Sharpens in seconds, I made a video about it.
wow, no idea this was a thing, very cool
Like the new format. Thanks.
I bought one at a gun & knife show several years ago and love it! It's the only way I can put an edge on stainless, and it makes carbon steel surgically sharp. I still use a slow water stone for chisels but everything else works great.
Paul Sellers would disapprove that mortise
Wow awesome tips ...what is the strap made of that you finished up with???
I thought you were moving?  or was that a maybe?
saw some comments on mdf. check out "The Art Of Weapons" channel to see this done with mdf, and how he compares it to wet stones. and how he makes done awesome knives in his yard. Thanks Izzy, another cool vid.
I would think a hand rest in front of the machine would help with keeping the desered angle, great video
nice system, a little pricy but it looks like it will save a lot of time. thanks for showing it.
hmmm, well that's a lot faster then what I been doing!
Is there a recognised sharpness test for blades? There are so many videos of people smugly cutting paper but why be happy with that? Paper tears easy enough! What's needed is a way of testing blade sharpness retention in use. Some of the super sharp blades are totally useless,they would not last seconds in real world use. We need a real world toughness and sharpness test, like slamming blade with a measured force into a standard load for several hard chops and measuring blade penetration. How close the last cut depth is to the first cut would be very telling.
MDF disks will do the same and way cheaper
I notice your intro mentions you're an "industry pro".  It'd be great if you could start to post videos of some of the commercial work you do.  So many Youtube woodworkers only ever post videos of personal projects and things they build for their shop and very few actually post any videos showing the production of the paid work they produce.  From their video output many folks  easily come to believe that these youtube personalities are nothing more than hobbyists with a camcorder.  Would be great to see some videos of your tips & tricks being used in a commercial setting.
I really like these tips, thanks Izzy!
In ur face, purests...
Good tip, I have also seen this done with pressboard wheels.
Very cool but I'm actually interested in knowing more about that butterfly knife handle chisel?   It looks great for carpentry.  Compact and safe when stored in a pocket or pouch.
Sharpen your knives with cardboard and glitter using this weird trick!  Seriously, this was so so cool :D I wondered where you got the awesome stones from, then you said they were cardboard :O Mind blow! How long now before people are laser cutting their own grinding wheels? :P
still prefer a stone but thats preference only thing is you need a generator for that in a field :)
xD Simple Little life made a Video about this same mashine today as well. Random?
how is the sog trident? im looking to get a new knife for everyday things
Thanks for all !!!
Thanks Izzy. Gonna try this.
But "Knife Guys" like to tell you about the 12 hours they spent sharpening 1 knife.
great vid once again. !!
Thanks Izzy .really good.tim Curwood in uk
