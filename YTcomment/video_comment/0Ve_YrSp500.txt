Hi sister how do you make your kombucha vinegar for cleaning
Hello Sarah I’ve been looking for GTs pure raw kombucha and I can’t find it. I use to use the blue bottle like yours and the gold pure one but I. Ant find it anywhere. Is there another way to make and grow my own scoby? Thank you ma’am
Been drinking kombucha for years and I’m very satisfied with brewing my own.
Good process, except for the use of cheese cloth. Fruit flies love kombucha, & can wiggle their way through cheese cloth, no matter how many times you layer it. A tight weave cotton cloth is better, like a cloth napkin, tea towel, or.piece of old clean t-shirt.
Wonderful. Dot
thank you
Thank you very much
I like mint kombucha. Can you use mint tea bags or do you have to start all kombucha with black tea?
Does anyone know if any type of tea can be used? Something that doesn't have caffeine in it like black tea
Thanks ❤❤❤
Hello, how are you from Syria, sick and in need of this medicine? Please help
What can you do if your story gets to vinegary?
the scoby is actually in the liquid and the "jelly thing" on top is just a bi-product of the fermenting and you dont really need it :)
Great video.  My favorite flavoring has been from juiced watermelon with fresh mint.
Hi🙏🙏🙏🙏❤❤❤❤❤🌾🌾🌾🌾
Bien 👍
When you add the flavour, are you letting it ferment for a few days too, or are you just adding flavour and drinking it right away?
Wonderful preparation!But how do you prepare SCOBY?
Can you use other teas instead of black tea?
Can the scoby be made without the store bought kombucha?
All the brits sitting here with our 370 bag of tetley tea 😂
Thanks for the video!! Love it!
intersiting
i love vinegar and other sour things that Indian grand mothers would say "Only Pregnant women have those things" and that includes Tamarind, and raw mango..........when i started searching on line for healthy stuff i can make at home,I saw Kombucha kits and dehydrated Scoby but since i live in India the closest i get to drinking things is just a tiny glass of sweet wine and that is like the wine you get in Church services because my mum doesn't like strong stuff..............but i still want to try Kombucha and Sauerkraut and also i would like to know about Kefir grains............and how do you make Sauerkraut and Kefir grains and what are the differences in Kefir grains and Kombucha ?
do you drink it undiluted?
Hi Iam dr.Moheeb from iraq , iam msc of pharmacy; I working now on kombucha preparation in my university laboratory. So iam very interesting about your work.  Contact with me if you don't mind   My phone number and whatsapp  00962779210930   All my regards and love 🌸🤍
Quit being so fake
is it oka if i use black chai tea
Does it get bubbly on its own? Like you buy in the store? I always bought the store bought was carbonated to make it fizzy/bubbly?
Thank u so much !!!
Best drink next to spring water ......agree that it’s delicious but spring water literally has no taste  lol 🧐 great video
Great video, thanks for all the tips! I'm trying to make kombucha myself, I grew the Scoby using GT's original, but when I put it in the new jar it doesn't float, it went down like 1 inch from the bottom. Now after 6 days it looks like a new Scoby is growing on the top. Is that ok?
I,m on board .✅🎀
Kombucha is kinda dangerous since all the mold spores your breathing in and there's already plenty of mold spores that you breathe in and Kombucha hasn't been found to actually do anything helpful to your body so
Looks nasty. I'm sorry. Not drinking moldy stuff, no how no way.
If there’s anything scarier than that scoby, it’s your face
Why my kombucha i still? :(
love this video! thank you <3
Can I use flavoured Kombucha to make Scoby?
i almost feel bad because im gonna ruin the 777 reactions streak. thanks for making this look so easy. im sure gonna try this at home. thanks for the upload and keep up the good work.
Hello!  how do i get a scoby!  I live here a short time and I don't know people who sell!  I live in Danbury!  I already added to your channel thank you!
Apple combucha please
You guys need to stop hitting on my girl.
Cheese puff
aaaaah my eyes! that is so bright in the intro
I made Kombucha twice now, following your instructions. It worked perfectly! I flavored some with berry blend juice and some with pineapple clove. It was a success. Acidity and sweetness were balanced and a lot fizzzzzzzzzzzzzz!
A quick question, I made peach and mango kombucha for the second ferment. They made Scoby's!! Are those any good and is that normal?
To make scoby from scratch - takes 2 to 6 or 8 months depending on the surrounding  Use sour fruits - I use pineapple and lime  In a glass jar add ratio (roughly)  1 part sugar ( white or cane) 3 part sour fruits 10 part mineral water  Mix in and leave in sit tight jar about 2 months After 2/3 months separate the fruit and juice Put juice in a clean jar don’t seal completely- use thick tea towel to cover up and seal with ribbon or rubber band and leave again for another 2-4 months depending how thick you want the scoby. Sometimes many layers of scoby are formed and the top most would be the strongest.
Sounds convoluted. I find ginger ale ez.
Your favourite drink is water?! I’m certain you’re an alien
Can  make kombucha with hany
Do you let it sit at room temperature??
🥰🥰🙋‍♂️
thank you for this videos your gorgouse
Heck... my grandmother used to make a similar thing with the peel of pineapples and water, let it ferment for three weeks and drink it iced.... I can't believe how right she was all along.
Useful but, I'm sorry, she has the strangest most child-like voice. So creepy for an adult to speak like that! Nope....
lmao 😂
do you have to use black tea? or can you use any tea...
Great job on the video. I've made my own kombucha before, but I am living out on the road doing contract jobs, and I didn't have a scoby. Thanks for letting me know how to start over. Love your video.
Hi there ..After you put the scooby in the 2nd batch of tea do you put in the fridge ? Or keep in the counter pantry?
how do you keep Kombucha constantly going? Do you re use the scoby? New to this... thank you
Hello I just got a scooby hotel from a friend and am wondering if I need to keep the lid open or closed. Can I make starter tea with this ? I am a newbie
very well explained, great video. thanks .
Best video ever about Kombucha, well done...
Can I use herbal tea,  I can't tolerate caffeine. I get sick  Please help
can kids drink this?
BLUEBERRY GINGER OR WATERMELON IS THEE BEST!!!!
Gees your beautiful
I'm supposed to SPEAK to the placenta??
You are Gorgeous!!!!
She’s pretty
beauty eyes
What if we dont have raw kombucha too ? 😔😔
Hey gentlemen I noticed there’s no ring on her finger FYI.
you are as kombucha! Thanks for video.
once the kombucha is ready, you take out the scooby and bottle the liquid ? but what with the scooby? just make a new batch ? so take out the scooby and remake tea , sugar , ... or can i leave the scooby in the fridge for when i want to reuse it? celinevanaerde@gmail.com
I’ve just tested/tasted the batch I’ve made using this exact same recipe! Came out great, thanks so much.. wish I can post a picture of HOW FIZZY mines came out!
My roommate is 60 years old and watching sesame street right now.  -_______-
I would love to try it but i cant get over how gross the scoby looks :(
Can you use a green tea instead of black tea?
thank you
One question here to the experts Kambucha brewers!! If I  can only get GTS's organic and Raw Flavored Kambucha or Kevitas brand does it matter if this drinks also contain other flavors or it has to be the original Kambucha flavor with any other juices or spices? Also she never really showed if she used the whole bottle or half of it?
your voice gives me ASMR
Thank you sooo much! My scoby has grown and im starting my first batch of kombucha now! Also, my scobys name is Scoby Doo. My mom named him lol.
İt tastes like beer
love this. I have a few questions after the kombucha is ready, should I put all the big jar in the fridge or I must leave it on the counter? How long does it take to expire if i let it on the counter in the big jar? And in the fridge?  days, weeks, months?  can it be in contact with daylight? I'm sorry all of this questions but I find that you know a lot about natural food, and for me is a new world.thank you very much
my fav is strawberry yum
What type of black tea would you recommend for kombucha making? There are so many to choose from and I want to use the very best for health and beauty. Thanks in advance!
"It's my favorite drink next to spring water". okay...
How does the carbonation stay in the liquid if you don't use a solid lid? Won't it just depressurize as it develops?
I LOVE KOMBUCHA I HAVE IT EVERYDAY !
Anyone else thinking of Jessie?
look at that face! exquesite
Your video is very informative and well done.... my fav. Kombucha  is ginger.... so... how do you make your ginger juice?
Another "health" product.....start by adding a cup of sugar and then later adding another cup of sugar.......its bullshit like almond milk.
your disgusting lady
I wonder how to make a Scoby without buying a store bought drink or a pre grown culture?
Scoby does fermentation but there is no vitamins production!
Great video, but I have a question... can I reuse my scoby for the next batch, or do I have to start all over again? I love Kombucha tea, but unless I can reuse or make a gigantic batch for bottling, I can see myself in a constant cycle. BTW: You are an incredibly beautiful woman.
Does anyone really know how to make this from scratch, without buying the kombucha
Could I save the starter tea for later use?
Is unflavoured kombucha the same as raw kombucha? Can I make  Scoby with this?
Hi I want to know where you store the starter culture? Then after and the final finish of the kombucha ?
I can’t find black tea kombucha. Could I use flavored from the store?
What happens if you only have a flavored bottle of kombucha? Will it still make the scoby?
I don't eat sugar, is there any alternative or I must use sugar to make kombucha?
I dont know how to find the raw kombucha. I dont if it is the one that sell in the store it looks different.
I hope some REAL thinkers find out that this garbage gives you Mange or Cancer.
Holy smokes, I need you my life.
Hi Sarah, Thank you for the great and easy to follow instructions on how to make a scoby  and brew my own komucha. My neighbor gave me his yummy mango infused kombucha yesterday and I asked for his recipe but he said he would only share his secrets if I shared my fruit and habenero salsa recipe...not gonna happen!! lol so I decided to look it up on YouTube and found you. I am going to give this a try and I'll let you know how it turns out. I love to drink kombucha but it is quite expensive, so I love that I can make my own now!! Thank you!!
Hi there! So I just developed my SCOBY and my first batch is fermenting :) I am now left with a lot of starter tea. I actually love the taste of it since it’s similar to apple cider vinegar. Does it have the same benefits or is it more potent than regular kombucha? :) thanks!
Can i reuse the scoby?
Good job thanks!  my sis and I always spend alot for buying  cambucha. From now on I will make it home. Thanks for sharing I like this vedio Thanks!
Is this even healthy it looks like a huge mold mushroom 🍄
After you bottle your kombucha what do you do with the scoby?
Hi Sarah !!! <3 how many time its necessary to let the kombucha before drinking them ? :)
Do you just drink the whole thing as it is in the final batch? No filters nothing right?
Hello, i bought a scoby on ebay. Do i need to add it to a fresh batch of tea?
It's been 2 weeks for me and mine doesn't look half as done as yours. Temp has been about a constant 75. Any ideas?
You should look Into alkaline water
My scoby is moving. Is that normal?
I like the stooby cooby flvour
Just finished up my starter batch. Praying that the kombucha gods give me a baby scoby soon! 😉
Can't you just buy the $3 tea box?
when we make the scoby should we dump the liquid? or use it as a starter for  the actual kombucha ?
I used this recipe and it turned out amazing!! I flavored mine mango in the second fermentation. I kept everything clean by using boiled water on vessel and anything else. I used the same ingredients for my scoby too. Really easy!
Hot ♨
Fantastic. Thank you so much :)
Can't wait to try this!
Dear, Sara, your videos changed my life .Now i drink kombucha every day and i am happy for it. Thank you, my friend. Happy Easter, wish you luck and love.
I am going to give it a try.
Can you use regular tea why only black tea.
Wait.. so if I can’t fine the raw kambucha, I need to buy a dehydrated scoby?
I have 3 kombhuchas isell it reply me
Thank you for posting this! I love it, and have limited places to buy it, so making my own is really wonderful! ❤️
This is awesome thank you so much for the clear easy instructions!
I lover lavender ginger!.. Omg super good..
2:33  My scoby was a liberal, so it was highly offended.  It took my encouragement as mansplaining.  It moved out, and now I have to pay restitution so it can live in it's own apartment and go to therapy.  Listen, people, do NOT associate with scobies in any way!
Trying it today!! Wish me luck. What roll does the caffeine play in the kombucha making process? Can I use a herbal tea? I'll be using black tea with cardamom. So I'm just asking out of curiosity.
So is the final kombucha al alcoholic beverage?
Hi,nice VD.But while handling kombu you should wear plastic glove to avoid any contimination.
why does it have to be organic? if its organic, i aint buying it. and if it has no gluten, i aint eating it.
nice & simple without all the frills, thank you : )
Snake oil
Your so beautiful!  Question, have you made it without tea and just juice? Would that make a wine?
I didn't get the "starter tea" part, I thought the first batch of tea we are supposed to make went all into the big jar to create the Scooby...so we're supposed to save a little bit instead of putting it into the jar and save it for the next step? And that would be the "starter tea"? If so, how much of it should I save and how should I properly store it? Please someone answer I want to make this
its really helpful!!!!!!! thank you !!!
KOMBUCHA  IS ENERGISING COS THERE IS TRACE AMOUNTS OF BOOZE IN IT LMAO
"Bayg"
Where do you let this sit while you’re waiting for it to grow? In shade, in the sun?
So use store bought kombucha to make homemade kombucha?
Everything you make is so mouth watering T_T <3 <3
I need help! I made some of my own kombucha and did everything you've said. I left it for 2 weeks. After that I was really excited but  when I took off the towel there was some mould on top. I poured it away and tasted some and started to taste as it should.  What happened? Please help.xx
I got my first scoby from a friend, but I killed it because I put it in the tea while it was really hot. So now, I’m attempting to make my own. Wish me luck y’all.
When drinking the final result, do you get the caffeine out of the drink still? Thank you
I have never tried making it but I think I may try, I started drink kombucha about 5 years ago to help me with my drinking problem. 5 years sober! Also most Walmart sell raw kombucha.
I'm gonna make scoby snacks and become beautiful. Knock off a millenia hopefully
Way too hot.
Gross
If my scoby becomes slanted and another scoby grows on top, when the kombucha is ready and I need to transfer the scoby to another batch what do I do with the original scoby?
I'm not talking to a SCOBY or anything that doesn't talk back. Nice video.
Huh, so this is what I am
Hi, please support my video. Thanks Step by step to make kombucha tea 👇👇👇😊😊😊  https://youtu.be/IkgcmHlZtLQ
Once bottled for how long can u store it
I have another recipe for you to try. Instead of using tea try using the dry skin from the brown or red onions (only the flaky dry skin) break off about 2 cups and make your kombucha. It will not taste like onions trust me, it taste like normal tea. It is full of Antioxidants and healthy. let me know.
Hi I made my first Kombucha using your recipe. After two weeks it had fermented. It tasted nice without any extra flavouring, I just used the  tea I originally used. I feel better for it. Thank you sweety
Bayges
The scoby looks like the skin the demegorgan shreds in stranger things which makes it look so unappetising
You look like an angel
I love the Booooch. <3
finally someone who shows how to make it from a bought !! I love you so much right  now!! <3
Easily one of the better kombucha guides on YouTube. So helpful 👍🏼
Is the scoby come from organic apple cider vinagre? Or a type of scoby.....
Can I buy scoby from you
Não tem como traduzir em português porque não intendi nada
I just used normal tea and normal sugar with a bottle of raw kombucha. Organic is preferred, but not always necessary.
Do you want drink kombucha wiht me,together? :D
I just bought some Kombucha and it was very vinegary. I'm thinking of using it on a salad as a dressing. :D
I told my kombucha that the world isn't fair and that it needs to put work in, to get a desired lifestyle.  It was growing too slow, so i made fun of it to its face.  Now it's strong, because it something to prove.
I like to make blueberry acai kombucha because when I bottle it a lot of the sweetness remains after it carbonates. I also like to play around with adding bottle dregs from sour beers to my kombucha starters to see if I can build variances with my different scobies :p
God you are gorgeous!
I wonder what kombucha taste like and why everyone is going crazy over it. This video made the process seem simple. I'll try it out
The scoby is actually Mother Brain
Scoby, very nice
Thank you I succeeded to make my Scooby and kombucha! I will play around with some flavours to change it up🙏🏽💕✨
SUGAAAAR
Can i use coconut sugar honey or stevia instead? white sugar has been banned from our house for years :/
How do you store your scoby until the next use?
wooow   thanks for you videos
I've tried and loved kombucha (just recently started popping up in stores in my area). I want to start making my own, but don't really want to use caffeinated teas as my body isn't a huge fan of excess caffeine. Are there herbal tea alternatives that I can use to make my own kombucha or is there a certain science behind what the SCOBY does to caffeine in the black tea that means I don't really need to worry about it? Any help would be great! Thanks!
Great video -- putting it on my facebook page. Thank you!
Hi! I was wondering if I should refrigerate the vinegary starter batch that you said was nice for salad dressings and/or a hair rinse? Also if I wanted to brew another batch do I just take a cup of my kombucha with the scoby and repeat the process or do I have to make another starter batch? Thanks so much!
Can you please provide link from where we can buy(Amazon, iHerb or any US based store) raw kombucha for scoby preperation?
Is it possible to use white tea rather than black tea?
hi ..please a want recipes for ibs ( irittible colon syndrome ) ....i'm suffring ( dépression and idea for suicide ) u inspire me a lot ...thnk you
Aren't SCOBY's like bacteria and yeast???...
say what do you do with the scoby just make more sugary tea?
Where can I find the raw Kombucha or the dehydrated scoby?
yr so Beautifull, Good Video
Very simple explanation of how to make Kombucha!! Thank you.
why do you need to add starter solution to your batch? To speed it up?
My favorite flavor so far is raw blackberries. I just put them in a food  processor. But you could just mash them up well with a wood utensil or clean hands. Read on for double fermentation.This is the best video for making Kombucha and Scoby on youtube / internet i could find. very good recipe, clear , quick , and to the point. Nice person to watch and listen to also. I did a double fermentation. Just add an inch of your favorite flavoring raw bluberries, blackberries etc.. to your store bought roughly 16 oz bottle. then fill the bottle with your kombucha you made from this video. Fill to about an inch from the top. Let sit for  3 days at room temperature. then refrigerate till cold and drink, keep extra bottles in the fridge.
2:33 We get it - you are insane.
Can we use honey or coconut sugar instead and where do we store it cool dark place?
So helpful thank you!
I enjoyed your video. You made it look very easy. Inspired to give it a try. Thanks for sharing.
I was so excited for this video until you said need raw kombucha mother. I don't know if I can get this where I live.  Thanks for the video.
I received a scoby from a friend and made my first batch of tea!  It is now 10 days, but there is not yet a scoby formed on top.  Does it always form a scoby?  Do I have to wait n bit longer?
Does it matter if the scoby sinks to the bottom?
why is it necessary to add sugar? sugar is not healthy
This is a great video!  Very helpful and informative!  I do have a question, though.  What do you do with the scoby, if you don't want to brew another batch, right away?  Is it possible to store it, in the freezer, for example?  Also, does it keep growing with each batch of kombucha?  To get a scoby from a friend, or give one to a friend, would I just need to cut a piece off a fully grown scoby, or should it be handled differently?  Ok, I had more than one question, but you did answer several of the questions I had before, in your video! :)
hehe "bags" x)
i was distracted  because of how beautiful this girl is
I feel like I would get too emotionally attached to the scoby
What does a Scooby Doo...? 😂😭😂😭
I thought kambucha was made outs of mushroom tea???
How do you store the scoby?
LOL Placenta!! ??? LMAO
I'm talking dirty to my kambucha
I think she is making some kind of mushroom tea not sure i'm distracted...4:07 she is back.
Bright personality !
kombu change is fucking disgusting tastes like old beer mixed with vinegar and a touch of testicle sweat
Is store bought kombucha on a bottle fresh? It has all the ingredients except the scoby. Black tea, raw sugar, kombucha culture, filtered water. Is that what you mean by fresh?
I am trying it out this weekend and I will let you know! Sounds real fun! Loved your video. It was very informative and fun looking!
Hi I am new to brewing Kombucha. I noticed my SCOBY is not forming well on the new batch. I brewed it for 7 days. It taste very good though. I am I not doing something right?
I found a really helpful article to scale up my kombucha production to 4-gallon batches for my weekly kombucha dose :) It’s a pretty comprehensive post on all the supplies and steps you’ll need, let me know what you guys think. "4 Simple Steps To Get 7 Days Worth Of Kombucha In One Hour” and the blog .com URL is simplemadesexy
my god you look healthy
"begs"
You're awesome! =)
Talking to it? Sounds creepy
i am living in mozambique and do not have a way to get KOMBUCHA to make my scoby ... any other way ?
does it have to be black tea? can I make Itwith chai?
hehe she said begs...
Guava
what  happy pleasant video, fun to learn  from you, direct and to the point, to many people supply so much unrelated waffle
Thanks for the recipe! So excited to try it out!
I did it. I tried Kombucha! I love it! Its so good! I am curently trying to make my own SCOBY. The bottle of raw organic Kombucha was roughly $4.99 American for a store brand. So making it will be essential for maintaining my habit. I followed the recipe as closely as I could. So here's hoping. I will update in a couple of weeks to tell you if it worked.

Loved your presence, pure and sweet.  How to make a scoby?  information is great, clear and concise.  I remember making it 20 years ago, now it's time to get back to it! Correct how you mention to infuse with positive good intentions (love) and how you use the first initial batch of making the scoby~ to drink or on your hair.  So sustainable.  Your whole video is great,  Thankyou!
Is snyenery kombucha good too?
Marry me.
How can I tell when it is ready to drink?
Fine
I'm so excited! My SCOBY is ready and I am starting my Kombucha brew tonight! YAY! Can't wait for it to be done!
I am in Love with the Guavva Goddess Kombucha from Synergy 👍👌☝
Since the scoby called mushroom, is it edible? If yes, how to cook it? Thanks!
black tea matters!
Does your kombutcha grow a thin scoby? I followed all directions including making my own scoby. Tomorrow it will be day seven and I have a thin scoby forming at the top. Should it be thicker? Is it supposed to be there. Can you please let me know. I've been patiently waiting for a month now and hoping everything went well. Thank you.
U say bags funny
mhmmm Spring water, Yum :P
Great video!  Can i add sugar to taste (more sugar!) at the beginning of the kombucha making process?  Or should i add more to taste after brewing?
if drinking Kombucha regularly gives me beautiful skin like yours. ...I'm in!
You are ridiculously beautiful! :P
i don't mind looking at you.
Oh no... I thought it was 1 cup sugar for making the scoby but it's actually 1/3 cup!! Will this affect my scoby?? Help please!!
Does anyone know if I can use GT's organic and raw gingerade for the "raw" portion? I can not find just the blue labeled raw Kombucha.
Can you reuse the scoby? Or is it better to start from scratch every time?
raw kumbucha like regular or just any that haven't been processed?
I make apple cider tea,now I have dozens of scobies I throw out. I'm tired of throwing them out.I will do this!
I tried this a couple months ago, but my kombucha never got fizzy enough. What am I doing wrong? When, exactly, does the kombucha get fizzy? Please help!
Thank you for being straight to the point and filled with love. Your awesome keep doing what your doing.
i liek your face
How do you add flavor?
This is great! You explain how to do this well! I've always wanted to know how to do this and now I feel comfortable doing it!
I love lavender kombucha.  My favorite brand in The Bu.  But I'm trying to learn how to recreate it at home .
Awesome!!!!!!  Thanks 😉
What do you do with the leftover starter liquid while you're using the scoby to make your first ferment?
I'm new to this...Can someone explain the sugar part?
HI Sara!! :)  Thank you for this video!! I really like the idea of making my own scoby! :)  Wondering.... how do you store the scoby, in case you want to take a break from making another batch of kombucha? Second question, once the kombucha is made, how long is it safe to store in the fridge?
Pronunciation is  kombuka ( h is silent )
I have found an easy way to make flavored kombucha.   I use 5 organic green tea bags for my basic recipe.    I then go ahead and use 1 -2 herb tea bags for flavoring.   I love raspberry and lemon/mint.  It's really easy, delicious and no second ferment necessary.   I usually ferment for 8days since I enjoy my kombucha a little sweet.   You can go 10 days to 2 weeks if you like a more sour/vinegar like taste.   Enjoyed your video.
have you a like. show us varieties of flavors you can do with kombucha
I ad vinegar it makes scopy fast
Awesome!! love kombucha tea
Does anyone know where I can buy the bottle of Organic Raw Kombucha in the UK?
your skin is AMAZING!  excited to try this.
Hey, I'm Tammy!! I used your video to make my own scoby and I'm flavoring and bottling my first batch this Monday. Your video was so helpful and easy. I think I will start with a berry assortment in a few and lemon and apple in the others. I love ginger too so when I divide my scobies, I will experiment with more flavors for those two batches. Thank you again and I look forward to responding with you more!!
It smells so bad, my friends mom made it once and it smelled horrible
can you use a tea other than black tea?
Probably a dumb question but, I learned that tea can grow it's own bad bacteria after 8 hours if not refrigerated and after 24 hours when refridgerated after a really bad food poisoning incident with some oolong tea. And I've even had a glass of herbal tea I forgot about for 3 days actually grow mold and gunk in it (not related to the food poisoning incident lol). So, does the scoby or probiotics keep the bacteria that may be harmful from actually ever growing while it's fermenting? I want to make this so bad because I hear of all the wonderful benefits and want to heal my gut via natural probiotics, because it seems like my health is declining (constant heart burn and chest pains, anxiety, extreme bloating after meals, face is breaking out HORRIBLY and face is itchy at times, random persistent small rash that comes in for a month or 2 on neck stomach or shoulder, then disappears and pops up in another place) instead of popping a probiotic pill, but I'm scared I might make myself sick if I do something wrong in the fermenting process like not add enough scoby or too much.if that's possible. I hope there's no way to mess it up at all and no way it can grow bad bacteria. I imagine you couldn't taste the difference since it is fermented.
How is the kombucha flavored? Does it get its flavor from the black tea you use? Can you use black based tea with fruit to make it fruity?
Great video thank you
wow thanks for the tip i had no idea i could use the synergy kombucha,  this evite time I've been drinking synergy kombucha alone not knowing i could have made a whole jar of it instead.  you probably just saved me hundreds in a month.
Can you drink the raw kombucha like in the bottle u showed
Hi, I am so glad I found your videos. I would like to start making my own kombucha. My question is ~ how long it actually takes for a 1 gallon jar of kombucha to get ready to be consumed?
Thank you.
you are so beautiful
I just made my first scoby a week ago! I can't wait till my Kambucha is ready yum yum! So worth the wait, I spend so much money buying it from the supermarket and decided I will make my own!
My skin turned red when i tried to clean my hands, I did what you did, took boiling hot water and put vinegar in it, the acidity weakened my skin and the water melted the skin. Now I have hypothermia for some reason.
what if u got a scoby off of a friend, do u still need to have the previous kombucha tea or is it ok to just put the scoby in?
Does the fermentation produce alcohol?
Thank you for this nice and easy way of showing how to make it. I have just received scoby and can't wait to try it.
Superb review; you covered all the bases.  Is it possible to just use the sun tea brewing method as well?
I'm guessing you use a gallon sized mason jar, or is that a  64 oz?
it must be good u look amazingly healthy
Do I have to use "Black Tea" or any tea will do? ie. Green tea??  Please reply. Thanks for the video!
Thank you for the video...Can you reuse the scoby when completely finished?
Got a scoby from my niece, and have made kombucha with it, but now it looks like an old piece of leather, not shiny and smooth like pictures of other ones I've seen online. No black dot or mold, just brown and rough shape. Any thoughts??
how long does it take for kombucha to do a detxox
Herbal tea has no flourine and damn woman you need to model!!!
Wouldn't herbal tea work better since it has no flourine/flouride? All teas including black tea suck flourine out of the soil. Case in point. To know black tea has flourine do this. Get a family size tea bag, boil it in 15-20 oz. water and drink it. If you feel nauseous or throw up this is the bodies response to poison and the elimination of a poison.
Really liked your video, thanks
I followed these instructions from start to finish.  Worked like a charm.
Will you marry me?!
Are you single?
I got a scoby from apple cider vinegar can I use  it to make kombucha
i haven't tried it get
How do I store the kombucha after I finish brewing the kombucha?
Treid the recipe, works like a charm, Even me, the 11 year old can do it. Sometimes it even tastes better than the store. Thanks. P.s. Kombucha trumps spring water any day
i mean im always hesitant to listen to crazy people saying tell your~ whatever that you love it, but uhh.. idk
My wife heard me say loving things to my scoby. She got jealous and now she is being a bitch.
Thank you I wanted to try this out for ages but I never knew how to make my own Scoby. You got me started!
just completed my first batch..your instructions were so good//helpful for a first timer like myself. thank you thank you thank you!
I made a batch of kombucha using green tea. I was told to start tasting the batch at about one week and if you like the flavor (not too sweet, yet not vinegar flavor either) then you could start the 'second ferment', so I did and it is not fizzy at all..........bummer.  THE FIZZ is what I love about the store bought kind!!  HELP!!!
I really enjoyed your video! Very well done!
Looks so easy, can't wait to try!  Thanks :):) Peace, Love & Kombucha! ;-)
Making this today except with chai tea :)
love this! I just discovered Kombucha and wanted to know how to make it at home!
Can you re-use the scoby or with each batch do you need to re-make it?
oh and one thing is try green tea very good and it dose not tarn
OMG !Thank you soooomuch !! Will do it today !!! Always wanted to get it but did not know how !!!
Thank you. You seem like a really nice person. Wish there were more like you around the world. God bless you. ☺
Thank you.  I just tasted kombucha (lemon - commercial brand) for the first time today and couldn't believe how refreshing and thirst-quenching it is.  Your very clear video will inspire me to have a go making my own!
Good video! You have a good vibe and beautiful eyes. My fav flavour is fresh ginger juice and fresh raspberry. I call it Gingerazz ;)
I just got on the kombucha train--this video is super simple and I will definitely try this method!
How much Kombucha is in the bottle that you add to make the starter? Great video. Thanks for sharing :-)
thank you so much i all ways loved your videos
Thanks a friend introduced me to this drink and am surely going to try and make a video once I nail how is done. I like ginger so that is one flavor I will surely use. Thanks for your video!
Gingerberry
it's "bags" not "behgs"  remind me of a serial killer
disgusting.
Great video!  Love kombucha:)
Was doing a ton of research on how to make Kombucha. Your video is the BEST out there on making Kombucha and very easy to follow instructions. Thanks so much for having the list of ingredients with measure in the video.
thank you for this! how big is the final jar you use for this? 1-2 gallons?  I only have space in my tiny apartment for 32oz jars, but I'm afraid of messing up the ratios by just cutting everything in thirds? do you think that would work? I've seen other recipes using 32oz jars, but i rather go with your recipe, given how delicious you find the drink :-)
I would LOVE LOVE a video on your eating habits! I don't even know where to begin with holistic eating!! Much love 😘
Love your video! :) raspberry and blueberry is amazing!
Why does the starter tea from making the Scoby taste bad? It seems like the same exact process as making the Kombucha.
Omg, so excited to try this !
Thank you for the excellent video.
awesome vid, I can't believe making kombucha is this easy. At the rate I drink kombucha, i literally could had saved thousands of dollars. I'm very excited to start my own brew. Thanks for the info
Thank you so much for this video. I could of gotten a scoby from a friend, but I wanted to make my own, because I'm just that kind of person. I loved how you gave very easy to follow, and simple directions, on how to make a scoby, and a batch, in just about 5 minutes. I've shared this video with a lot of people since it's so easy to follow!
omg so gross you need help
Can you use any kind of tea? I'm not a fan of black tea but I'm wondering if it would work with hibiscus tea? Also, can you get raw kombucha in  the us?
not gud
What doe do with the scoby after the kombucha has fermented and is drinkable? Can you put it back in the starter jar until you need it again?
My scoby looks healthy but when I made the batch of tea to make the kombucha it looks like the scoby is sitting at the bottom of the jar.  Is it dead or something?
You are so beautiful, just love your hair.  Ginger would be my favorite.
how long does the SCOBY last and how do you store it?
Can you please tell me we have to put in the fride after making the Kombucha. I will be pleased to hear from you.
Awesome !! thank you for the video
Hello, I like  to know how to separated new baby scoby from mother one? Thank you so much.
what is a kombucha?
Do I have to use Black tea, or can it be green tea?
Instructions unclear, got my dick stuck in the bottle again.
Can i eat the scoby?
It's working! My scoby is growing really well after just a week :D Thank you for sharing!
thank you for your guidance! this video has been very easy for me to follow. my scoby has been growing for half a day and I'm keen to watch it grow over the next few weeks!
What exactly is scoby?
This is a great video, Thank you! I bought a scoby and after about ten days it sank to the bottom. I don't know if its dead or what. I'm really trying to make kombutcha so after seeing your video, Im starting over. Now, I know I can make my own and it will be the real deal!
Thanks. This video is short and comprehensive. I wish I would have found this one first. One question though, what is a tea beg?
Is the Scooby dissolving in the kombucha or you can reuse it to do another 3 liters?
fantastic!!!! I love the addition of love to the scoby!!!! I flavored my last batch with red grapes, blueberries, and cranberries!! awesome video!!
A scoby is not alive is it?
I love how people answer questions in the comments down below 😊
So when you say fizzy, do you mean carbonated-like?
You are so cute!!  Thanks for the video!!
I know im dumb but what do you need a scoby for???
Adding the ginger won't kill the bacteria?
i don't have a scoby. could i just use a placenta?
Fucking hippy
Can you refrigerate the kombucha once it ferments??
extremely attractive!!😉
can  I add organic coconut sugar?
Do you have to add sugar? Also, does the finished Kombucha have caffeine in it?
Hi what do you do with the scoby after you make the tea? I am new to this and just received my first scoby. I put it in the frig until I get my jar and tea to make it is that ok? thanks for sharing
i made a pomegranate oolong with english breakfast turned out really good!
I love lavender!! How long does the buch stay good for?
Sub,d And gingerade is my favorite just started my first attempt at a scoby yesterday so guess I'm waiting a couple weeks huh for it to form was thinking it took a week but now I know that's with brewing not making the scoby so wish me luck and I'm so looking forward to my first glass of self made kubucha I'll probably try flavoring w/ lemon,ginger? Or just ginger?
can you use brown sugar instead of organic cane sugar?
Thank you
I just tried my first kombucha drink this week and loved it. But at $5 a bottle I didn't want to try adding it to my diet (for a digestive problem I have) only to go broke. lol I read up on it a bit and found I could make it on my own and I instantly thought, "I wonder if holistichabits has made a "How To" video on this..." lol You do everything, I love it! Thanks girl! Can't wait to get started
how do you store the scoby for future use? x
I'm so gonna make this when I am home for more than a week at a time! I just recently got into kombucha, it took me some time to get used to the taste, but now I am obsessed! Not only does it taste amazing and refreshing, but I feel energized and alive after drinking it. Love this, thanks Sarah<3
Hello, I have a dumb question maybe...but in the last step...do I refrigerate the tea with the scoby or keep it out?..can I remove the scoby and refrigerate the tea?..I do like it cold  :/ thanks
Hi. Would you please let me know, how you use it as a hair rinse? Did you make your grapefruit , rosemary infuse? If yes,  how? Thanks a lot.
I usually brew the tea in just a little bit of boiling water and once it's down seeping I add filtered water to bring it back to room temperature, that way I don't have to wait for all that boiling water to cool!
I love love love kombucha. I buy it and my mom is always making a new batch yummmm
You look like a Disney princess!  Gorgeous!  Thank you for the informative video.  I want to try to make grapefruit-rosemary infused kombucha.  :D
Tea begs haha, accents are cute
Is it possible to not use sugar? I don't eat processed sugars, only honey... will it work?
aww you're so cute! i love how you said to encourage the scoby :) thanks for this video. i LOVE kombucha but it's so expensive to buy.
Greetings! My daughter directed me to your channel, and we love it! Some tips I picked up about Kombucha, and a question: 1. organic prunes + vanilla = Dr. Pepper flavoured kombucha ( and if you are from a Dr. Pepper region, you know how important this is!); 2. Use small balloons to cap your bottles while fermenting to allow the bottles to gas off and not explode! Q.: Why is the starter tea so vinegary, and why does it not make kombucha? I've looked but not found this answer. Thanks, KK
What are your thoughts on the high fluoride content in kombucha? That's the main reason I stopped drinking it.
Could I reuse the Scoby?
I just got my scoby from a friend and my first brew is about 5 days along and i am very excited about it! Such a cool thing! Very nice and inspiring video, thanks!
you forgot to tell them to let the tea cool b4 u add the scoby so it does not kill it
talking to scoby stupid like it can here you
Ginger kombucha is my favorite
Hello  great video  my fav f2 flavor  is  ginger and star anise
This was so helpful! My dad and I are obsessed with kombucha and now we don't have to spend as much! Thank you!
Here's a really easy tip- I bought a bottle of health-ade kombucha at the supermarket a few months back and I wanted to save the bottle to put some flowers in or something. Well I guess I left about a half inch of kombucha sitting at the bottom and it grew its own scoby! I was shocked as I've made your recipe 3 times now to no avail. So I will be using my scoby for my first batch of kombucha. I suggest you all do the same! I have added it to the starter solution to see if it will get a little thicker, as it's not as thick as I want it to be. But what surprised me the most is that the scoby actually came from the pomegranate flavor. Not even the original! I think it has to do with the sweet fruit enzymes fueling the scoby growth. If you guys don't want to make the stater solution I suggest you just buy and drink your kombucha and leave a little at the bottom, and allow that to sit for a month of so.
I wish I saw this a couple weeks ago! I have a batch of Kombucha going right now but bought a scoby not knowing you can easily grow your own! Love you videos, <3
this is the most imformitive vid i have seen thanks!!
Where do you sit the kombucha while its fermenting? Like in a cool, dark place? On your counter top?? Its summer here and Im unsure if the room temp is an issue?
Do you have to use black tea? Can use green or a herb tea?
How long do you like to leave your kombucha to brew before bottling it?
Can I use Rooibos Tea instead of black tea?
apple cinnamon kombucha! Add cinnamon bark, vanilla powder, apple juice and let it sit for a week! sooo good tastes like a cinnamon roll
Are there any other appealing alternatives that could be used as a substitute for the organic cane sugar?
What is that disgusting thing???
Does the jar need to be stored in the fridge or can it be left on a counter top?
my god i did not know kombucha can make people so beautiful! i was going to cure my ibs syndrome but if i get also crazy handsome then lets do it kombuchaaaaa!
I love chia seed kombuchas!!!
hi Does this contain alcohol in it?  You say fermented, which makes me thing of alcohol
Yummy!!!
is the one bottle of kombucha unflavoured? Can I just get raw kombucha, whatever the flavour?
can you re-use the scoby over and over again? what if you can't re-use it immediately after finishing the kombucha brew? Would you put it in the fridge in a glass container?
Hi, I noticed you used tea bags with aluminum staples?  Im assuming this is not included in he "can't touch metal" part.
You are so gorgeous and you radiate such positive, sweet vibes! Thanks heaps for the video - I'm excited to see my kombucha do its thang.
Do you put the mixture in the dark while it is growing or do you leave it out in the light?
the benefits aren't proven tho
To make it fizzy, does the bottle have to be sealed to build pressure, or does that occur anyways? What exactly are the bubbles? CO2?
I just put my scoby in the tea and am now wondering how I'll get the tea out without disrupting the scoby since my jar doesn't have a nozzle. .???
Some people use cheesecloth. I like using natural coffee filters. Then when they get ruined i soak them and break them down and throw it in my worm bin! =]
just what i was looking for thanks!
You are such a ball of light!
You say "bag" and "hand" funny?
My Dutch Oma used to make this. Just wondering if I can also use herbal tea instead of black tea?
What do u do with the big kombucha after its done brewing in the second batch?
thank you for the  great tutorial was looking for a simple method to use with the raw kombucha bottles! <3 :}
So after you make your first batch of kombucha, would you just save some to use on your next batch as starter tea?
From one kombu ha lover to another,  yeah!!!! Love it to,  thanks for sharing
hi, how long can you keep the baby scoby, and how do i store it? thanks you are so wonderful and sweet, very kind, love your vids
Never buy a dehydrated scoby, it just won't work as well, get a fresh one, I do recommend Kombucha Kamp, Hanna's scobys are awesome and her attention is unrivaled.
So excited to try this! <3
I really think this will benefit me.....but I'm allergic to caffeine, is there anything else I could use to make it?
I would be interested to know how you make different flavors of kombucha, or do a favorite flavors of kombucha.  Just bought my ingredients to begin making my scoby and homemade kombucha! :)
please tell me how to save the scoby? how long can I keep them? do I leave out or in the fridge? your video is the best from all thethe others on youtube. Thanks!!!
Can anyone describe what natural & homemade Kombucha tastes like? :)
I think this video is the most heipful video I have seen on Kombucha
Where do you store the kombucha once it is fully made? The refrigerator? How long is it good for?
@holistichabits, is it okay to drink the first batch of fermented tea (the one I've grown the scoby in)?
While you are waiting for your scoby to grow, did you leave it out on a kitchen counter? Some vids on youtube say please in a warm, dark closet.
do you have to use black tea?
You are so lovely and beautiful and i loved your very clear and simple video ! It was of great help, i can't wait to try it ! Oh also can you use it with other types of sugar ? Coconut sugar etc... ? and caffeine free tea ? thank you :)
Hi there i'v been brewing kombucha a while now, my favorate flavour is oolong  tea with rosehip, I have so many to chose from, hibiscus  ect. ect.......cheers to healthy brewing...Blessings.
I tried this tea in a lavender flavor and it tasted like perfume. I will only have the regular flavor. But KOMBUCHA is yummy!
My favorite flavor is mango dragon fruit
I wanted to post one more update: I just finished bottling my first batch of kombucha tea. It tastes wonderful! I'm so pleased with the results using your recipe. My SCOBY grew a nice "baby" as well. I let my kombucha brew for 10 days total and it's perfect, just a touch of carbonation and slightly sweet. Thank you!!
If you constantly brew kombucha, you should look into a continuous brewing system! You will have a steady flow of kombucha, while saving time and effort!
I have been watching a lot of your video's lately, and i have to say you are one pretty smart lady!! I have been using coconut oil for a couple of months now, and it my remedy for everything. I find your tips and video's very helpful. Thanks for sharing love from Merel in the Netherlands
I don't drink tea with caffeine, would this work with a tea that doesn't have caffeine?
I followed this recipe 2 weeks ago and I now have a SCOBY! It's not quite thick enough yet to start brewing but I think it will be good to go in a couple more days. I'm so excited! I even took pictures of it from day 1 to today to track its progress. Can't wait to start brewing! Thank you for the great video & recipe!!
i love you girl! great job
omg me and my mother have been waiting so long to make kombucha and now we can because of you.. how amazing is that
I want a scoby pet too lol
Would it work if I make it with green tea? and coconut sugar?
how long is the kombucha good for?
Thx, great video! Is it necessary to store the jar in a dark place when growing the new scoby?
Great video! Very thorough & easy to follow. I just started growing my first SCOBY using a bottle of GT's raw, organic kombucha. Can't wait to start my first batch of kombucha!
Thankyou. :D  Kombucha is awesome. I love growing my scobi's.
Live never heard of this before. Which country did it originate from?
Can you make a video on how to maintain the kombucha? :) Thank you!
Can you reuse the scoby?
What is it?
Great video! Making my first scoby tomorrow!
I tried making this recipe following your instructions, but after two weeks, still no scoby. I did a bit of research and it seems that after 2010 people can't really make kombucha using the store bought kind because it's a different formula and people have a difficulty growing the scoby that way. Do you know why your's worked and mine didn't? I would love help with this, thanks.
i  got  the  kambucha  Raw gingerberry  and citrus  can  i  use  that to make  my  scoby..can  u  plz  help  me  i ready  have  my  tea ready
Thanks for this video! Once I tried Lavendar Kambucha.That was an interesting take on it!
At any point do you have to refrigerate this?!
I bought my scoby of etsy for 4 bucks. I hope it's safe, the reviews were good
I bought my Scott of etsy for 4 bucks. Hope it's safe, the reviews were good
Is there anything I could use as a substitute for the cane sugar? Thanks :)
Such a beautiful and perfect girl to explain such a beautiful and perfect drink---THANKS ;)
i love elderberry and rose hips ;-)
Hi I have a question, can you drink the kombucha after the first brewing or do you need to wait after the second brewing with the large batch and wait 2 more weeks which would be a total if 3-4 weeks to drink homemade kombucha?
You are amazing!!! Keep making videos! I will always watch! You're an inspiration!
real talk.. sperm has over 200 vitamins and minerals many of them rare and vital.. carbonated beverages get nutrients to your blood stream faster, my friend was woundering whether or not you can use sperm to put into your kombucha before bottling, or whether or not you can ferment the sperm, my friend thinks this might be one of the keys to the elixer of immortality, please answer''
my favor so far is the green one with spirillina and blue green algae :)
Do you have to use black tea?
wonderful! I just bought the scoby. Don't know if can brewing with chaga tea and birch sugar.I will try it!
lovely thank you so much! i love kombucha. thank god we have a little health food store here where i live. can get an unflavored kombucha tea. this is so easy!
I notice your Scoby is not floating on top does that matter?
Store bought kombucha is soooooooooo expensive, almost $4 a bottle here in MA
I feel like that scoby is going to attack me at night.
I like ginger and mango
How long did it take you to grow the scoby that large? a month? two? Just wondering as I am currently in the process of growing my scoby.
I just started brewing my own Kombucha. So far I love the orange-lavender flavor I made but ginger is also quite good :D I make Kombucha with organic green tea.
beautiful star child!, you say 'bags' the same way  do begs, love your video and commitment to holistic health! keep on keepin on!
Synergy 's Grape or Cherry with chia seeds, yum!  :)
Are you a vegan? You have beautiful skin!
Can you drink the kamboucha from your when you first make your scoby? Or do you have to discard that first batch?
I'm scared of this stuff
Scoby scares me:(
Never use a dehydrated scoby
you can use unflavored green, white, or black tea.You can even use rooibos! Good Luck.
Rooiboos? Really? Love that tea!
What if you get a scoby from someone else? What would you use in the kombucha in place of the starter liquid?
The prep of the kombucha always have to be with black tea??
Hi Your video is Great!! Im new to this, I have a question, I started to make my own scoby about a week ago i was just wondering, my kombucha does not look as smooth as yours is that okay? And a second thing, is it okay to gently sink the kombucha in the tea so it wont get dry? Thanks!!
You are soo bright! :)  The scoby deters me from wanting to drink the kombucha ... just like attempting to make raw sauerkraut ... afraid to see mold ect. and reluctant to eat it lol ahhh
What kind of environment do they need to be stored? Cool dark place? Dark and warm? In the kitchen? In the basement? Thanks
Pomegranate kumbucha with chia seeds!
Can you use brown sugar?
Oh I'm gonna try this.I try to be healthy when I can.I'm trying to implement new things into my lifestyle.can you tell me anything about spirulina?
Does anyone know if you can use green tea rather than black tea? I really dont like to drink caffeine and Ive read that black tea can be inflammatory.
ewww sorry but this looks extremely gross lolol where is this coming from? never heard of it before..
I don't think so because the sugar helps fermentation
Is it possible to make it without the sugar?
That looks so good,I love your videos. :)
hello, i have a question. I bought kombucha because of this video and drank a 16oz bottle. Is it common to feel bloated after drinking it? just curious.
*or
This was a great video! I'd love to try this. One thing though, vinegar will not sterilize a jar. The contact time needed to use vinegar to kill bacteria is very long, so boiling water or chlorine solution is needed to SANITIZE the jar. Sterilization requires use of an autoclave of extremely strong chemicals.
Can you reuse the scoby?
my favorite flavor of Kombucha is the GT's brand, the green one...
the scoby looks kinda gross lol
great video!! I want to make Kombucha!! it looks difficult though...
crystal? like crystal meth?
While the scoby is being grown will it smell a bit funky? And where do you store the jar while this process is being done?
Yay :) sounds great.
The scoby eats the sugar! So you shouldn't have to worry. the longer you ferment it, the less sugar it will have <3
yes, use it again for another batch! and it will form layers which you can take apart and have many many baby scobies <3
Yes I do!!! Would you like me to make a video on my crystal collection?? I think that would be fun to do :)
I'm making an outfit "lookbook" video :D Only problem is i'm having trouble finding royalty free music, but once I figure that out I will put it up <3
You should do a "Get ready with me" video! :)
Can u do nail tutorial of nail care to help them grow and your hair care ? :D x
can you do a video on a manuka honey face mask?
what happens to the scoby once the Kombucha is ready to drink? can it be used again? thanks for the video - straight forward and clear : )
Oh wow...I have never heard of this before. I guess I'll have to do more research...but isn't all that sugar you put in bad?
Ah can you do a tutorial on your eyes I have the same color eyes and I want someone do a tutorial Thanks :)
I think in one of your videos you mentioned that you had problemed skin.  Could you maybe elaborate on that.  I have acne and I would love so hear what kind of things you do to keep your skin so pretty
Cool just yesterday i tried kombucha for the first time and i really liked it
i really want to try this looks like a fun experiment :p
about how many cups do u think it makes?
Fermented foods are great for health! They are rich in probiotics which will help with digestion, and they are abundant in vitamins, particularly the B-vitamins :) If you don't feel good eating them however, maybe they aren't right for your body and you should discontinue. Everyone is different!
Yes, after fermenting there will be a tiny amount of alcohol present. Around 0.05% I read?! You would have to drink copious amounts for it to affect you though :)
You're welcome! Good luck :)
Thank you so much!! I'm glad you are liking the videos :)
I adore you! You are gorgeous and make the greatest most inspirational and informative videos! Please keep making them xoxo
So then every time you make kombucha you transfer your drink to a bottle and put in it the fridge. then you start to make another batch in a sterilized jar. Is it important to save a cup or so of your finished product to add to the new batch?
Thank you so much for your tips.....Now I can make my own kombucha
Do you know if there is a place we can buy the scoby?
This is.. interesting. Willing to give it a try as long as there's no alcohol present.
Does the finished Kombucha contain alchohol?
You're so beautiful and glowing. I am a new subscriber and going through all your videos and loving them :)
hahah yes it does look scary. I don't know where in europe you can get it :( You might want to look into getting a kombucha starter kit, with a dehydrated scoby? I have never used one though. xo
aw thank you so much! xo
As long as everything is sanitized while making it, and no mold is growing on the soby, it is very safe! It is a raw, live product, so it's important to be cautious, but honestly I have never had any trouble with it! xo
do it!! I know.. I get scared with the sanitization, but it's actually so easy :) Hope you make it!
The scoby will keep getting thicker and you can pull away the layers, and you can make other batches of kombucha with that! So technically, if you keep brewing, and taking care of a scoby, it can last indefinitely! xo
awesome!! :)
Hi! Yes you can play around with different teas. The black tea is supposed to be the easiest to ferment (and most common for kombucha) but you can certainly try with other teas. Some people have trouble with using different teas, I haven't tried using anything other than black tea yet.. but I'm sure it will work fine!!
no :) But I just recommend it to reduce the toxic load in our bodies! I definitely would recommend using organic sugar for kombucha though, because the sugar cane crop is one of the most sprayed crops! xo
I will!! <3
Thank you! I'm so glad you like my videos :)
Oh no! Why can't you respond?!
Yes, I do make water kefir as well!!
yes, cause that's what feeds the yeast! but the yeast will digest the sugar, so it won't be like you are actually drinking that much sugar :)
it tastes really good IMO!! It's sweet (unless it's super fermented, then it's more vinegary). Its also really fizzy :)
Do I have to use sugar?
Great video!!! I can't wait to make some. I just don't know where to get a large glass jar like the one you have. Where did you get yours? Do you think I could find one on-line? Please make more videos. You're my favorite channel!!!!
Yay! seeing your video in my feed made me smile :D Love your channel & spirit!
Hello! Love your videos! You are indeed very pretty! Just wanted to ask you if its ok to replace the black tea for any other tea perhaps green tea? I'm not a big fan of black tea and was wondering if its a key ingredient to making the kombucha or if one could switch it out for something else? :)
YES! Thank you for this video because I have been wanting to do this:)
I also love ginger kombucha best.
Thanks for the awesome video. How many times can you reuse the same scoby?
at first I thought it was disgusting and tasted like vinegar flavoured tea. But just give it a shot, and keep drinking it and developing the taste on your tongue, and you'll see it's DE-LI-CIOUS! Especially green tea kombucha :)
I love  your cooking video's I've been a bit scared to make my own Kombucha but I am going to do it!! Please keep making video's like this xo
Great tutorial!  I've been wanting to make my own kombucha for awhile-- I'm just nervous about the sterilization part!  How do you make sure your jars are sterilized?
I am very curious about this, but it's such an odd idea. What is in raw kombucha (is "kombucha" a thing on its own)? I'm sorry if this is a stupid question, but I am from Denmark and I've never heard of this before.
Indie mymusic! ✌❤
This looks interesting.  Can someone get ill from this if its done wrong? Xxx
How does it taste?
