LOVE colors
Thanks for the inspiration
Love this 👍👍👍
We are having our holiday party in two weeks and I cant wait to do this for our guest as a take away I think I'll add mini cookies already packaged too. Thank you
Very cute candy bar.
Beautiful!
Athomewithnikki love it. I'm going to try this idea for my home. Thank you sooo much for all the inspiration.
This is still my absolute favorite candy bar of all times! You encouraged me to make my own.
That's nice! I'm hosting a family dinner after the New Year. I'm pleased to announce that I wish be creating a candy bar 🤗 Thanks for the idea! Yours is beautiful!
I love it, God Bless.
Love this!!!
Love this idea...Definitely going to incorporate into this years holiday decor.
o wao this is beautiful God bless you God gave great hands to do such of beautiful things thank you for sharing
Love!
So inspiring! Really enjoyed your video! Gave me great tips and ideas! I'm a mommy of two boys as well and my home stays glammed up and pretty and they respect it and my family loves it. Xoxo your awesome!
I like the idea of a candy bar at my entryway.  I will definitely be using this idea for EASTER!
AWESOME as always
Great idea and informative.
It would've looked so much better, if you would've removed the label
I like
Now $tree has a few color specific candies & bubble gum  great money & timesaver
love this idea! how can you change out the ribbon though? without messing up the ones on there...tia can't wait to see more of your videos😄
i love it!!..thanks for the great ideas
Oh wow!! Im in Columbia, SC...look like Northwood Mall in Hannah
woww you are awesome so elegant I love it
Hello, I just watched your candy bar set-up and loved your presentation and what I learned about doing this project.  I am interested in creating a glam/bling law enforcement retirement party.  Do you have any advice that you can share with me please?
Lol "hand over your check" lol
you have the most beautiful ideals .
Absolutely beautiful I love it!
Hello First I love your professional way of doing your videos. Where do you store all your "items" when the season changes? Also I watched your video on your craft/office video.Love it How do I convert a room to office and craft room.  I design wreaths and I have a lot of flowers/ribbons, etc Thanks
Loved this video!!! My ocd was killing me when the sticker on the vase was left on then glued.....
Oh wow I love this idea, next year I will do this all year long..haha - keep up the videos!
Love this idea! Thanks Nikki. great video as always
Geesh Nikki, Everything you touch is just stunningly beautiful. Even something this simple. You are truly gifted, my friend.
Hi Niki,  I was wondering if you have a video on  a Christmas Candy Bar.  I am interested in putting one together this year and would love to see something you have put together for Christmas.  Thank you!
Saw candy bar at a wedding, yours is much nicer. I will try this. Don't have a steady hand to center everything on the jar. I'll have to lay the 3 layers on a flat surface and glue, then apply to jar, then apply centered bling. Never been to Michael's, thanks for the peep-show. :-)
You really need an hgtv show-  you are so talented!  Better than anything on hgtv now. I love your videos . So many ideas.
I have a small foyer, a fire place and a sitting area. I really want to know how to maximize that space and decorate it year round. What would you have as some suggestions?
Nice Nikki!  So the glue gun sticks?  I've seen others use glue. Maybe because it was glass over glass.
Was there a reason u left the sticker on the bottom of the glasses before you glued the candlestick to it?
Love this, what a great idea.  This makes use of vertical  space.  You can put out more candy in less table top space.  Fantastic tip!!!!
Awesome I love it😳
Beautiful, elegant and simple 😄. Thanks for sharing Nikki.
Lol your voice was high pitch during those older videos!  Love it!
I would love to see you Christmas candy bar.
I wish I can pick out a kisses thru my phone. 😂 I really love your creative ideas. I wish you were in Toronto so I can hire you to fix up my wine/candy table for the Canadian  Thanksgiving. 😍
why didn't you take the paper off the bottom?
Hi Nikki  Sister girl  i love this i am going to  try it and I will take a pic and send to you  love you Nikki please  keep the videos and your wonderful ideas coming may Allaah continue to bless you with many more great ideas.
Really nice
NIKKI, hey friend! I'm doing a cupcake tower and candy bar for my parents 40th Wedding Anniversary next month. I'm so nervous cus I want it to be perfect. Any addtl. tips? What's a estimated budget for what you did in this video? Thanks in advance.

haha did you hear me yelling, "no that one! right there,,, right,, " haha
so excited to run into your videos on a plain search, instead of searching your site, because I see more this way. My Michael's is also in NCharleston. So very happy to know that we shop in the same stores. Now I wanna see your manny! Haha (go to the dollar tree)
Love it, regards from morocco
That silver floor lamp is gorgeous!
YEEESSSS For Charleston, SC!!! Love the idea!!
You won my subscription to your channel with this amazing video. Wow to those vases you made. I can't  believe you got the glass part at the dollar store. They look amazing!!!! Wow again!!!
I have always admired people who were creative.  I have to say you take first prize in the creative department.  I'm absolutely amazed at the gift you have been given.  My home is more the primitive look, but I think I'll look for items that match my décor and copy your design.  God bless.
How yummy is this idea!  Thank you Nikki!  Happy holidays, and peace friend.
What a great idea!
Wow Nikki what a pretty and easy idea.I can't wait to see your Christmas take on this. Now I have silver candle holders and  tall glass vases on my head...shame is so late and Michaels is already closed.Thank you for sharing!
very nice thanks for the inspiration!
Super super cute! I wish I saw this video before my wedding thanks!
love your purse!
i like that :)
Question, was that paper sticker on the bottom of the glass? I notice that all of the candle sticks were held to the sticker? Was that intentional?
Hey Nikki, I love the fact that you took us to the store with you. Great ideas! Great brain!
Love this, its so beautiful!  Thanks for the additional ideas of using plastic tumblers or mason jars.
I love you!! A candy bar just because...I would be at your house all of the time...lol. I'm going to use this for a dinner party I'm hosting for my hubby's birthday!!! Oh, and I love the tone on tone and retro ideas. Thanks for posting! :-)

This is so beautiful...You've made me rethink about paying someone else to set up my candy bar for my bowling party this summer...Can you give me some ideas for a grown up bowling party?
That was great....thank you for sharing!
I feel like i got my shopping therapy done today. I love it.
Can I use glass candle lovers instead? Would i still use the e600 glue? I love this idea.  Im trying to make this for my babyshower xandy buffet.. although what i already have is the glass candle lovers.. i also went online and still searching for beads.. thanks a bunch!!
I love your candy bar idea!!!
I really enjoyed this video...lived it!! I can't wait to try this in my home :)
Love the finished product--so pretty and chic!  Thanks for the instructions!
You are so organised... I love your ideas...
This is beautiful.. And didn't cost much!!
I loved this. It looks so elegant !  I love crafts like that .
Great idea!  Love it, very pretty.
I love it!!!
Nikki, Will you be doing a video of an Easter candy bar? I host a monthly themed luncheon for my friends in my home and I'd love to see more of your videos on that topic. Thank you for your videos. I look forward to making a cup of tea and sitting down to enjoy them. God bless.
This would be great for receptions & parties too. Wonderful!
Thanks great tip !Having a wonka party for my daughters birthday you've given me a great idea with the jars!
Hi Nikki I am still catching up on your videos. Absolutely loved this idea. Here's a quick tip that I hope everyone can appreciate.I know you will since you love to re-purpose.Well, I've discovered that it is sometimes better and more cost efficient to use thin strips of velcro or the little velcro circles to adhere the ribbon and the jewels. That way you can use for other projects like candle embellishing and things like that. You don't have to worry about that messy hot glue. Hope this tip helps.
I just needed to let you know exactly how I feel! You are insanely talented and I absolutely love your videos!!!!
Hi Nikki,I luv luv luv your style. You are such an inspiration. You have such great taste.the ideas you share in other videos.
so pretty
Love it! Trying to put one together for a child. Hmm...
Just came home from the Dollar Tree got the candelabra and votive $2! Looks beautiful, Thank You!!!
Thank you for the tip. I'm starting on the project now. It's coming alone great
I am here in North Charleston,  South Carolina! Do you do any local classes?
Nikki you are absolutely BRILLIANT!! I LOVE your style! I'm right up the road here in Lexington,SC. Totally enjoy your channel!!! Can't wait for you Holiday ideas this year!!
I just did this Nikki and I love my candy bar (and so does hubby:). Tks for sharing!
Love this! Feeling inspired! YOU'RE AWESOME!
Love the candy bar
Dear Nikki, can you please adopt me? :)
I love your ideas. This candy bar is fabulous!
I love your candy bar..... Thanks for the idea to check the dollar store and to glue the candle holders for height variation.... great idea!!!!
Loooooooooove this!
I am so loving this video! Great ideas and more. be blessed!
Well hi neighbor!!! :).  Thanks so much.  So glad you liked.  Hope your doing great.  Nikki
Girlfriend.. u live in Charleston...Im in Myrtle! Anyways.. U have great ideas!
I absolutely adore your style and channel, I have almost watched every video in the past couple weeks. I was looking for a solution for my dry goods, as I had them in the plastic cereal savers that run $3.99/each and sometimes more... I ruined in in the dishwasher so I Purchased 5 pkgs of the Jars!; I They are amazing and I am OCD about everything being uniform - these are PERFECT! Best part, they have been around for years, so if one breaks or I need a new lid the style will be the same!
Just  beautiful.  Nikki you rocked this Candy Bar!!!!
This is absolutely beautiful! I am impressed by your creativity and your ability to translate instructions in an understandable way! I am SO glad I found your channel today!
I didn't think that would look good but wow!!!  It looks really professional. I used to be a big crafter, I paint and went to school for flower arangment but stopped doing everything when kids grew up and moved out. Now I want to get back into crafting. But maybe not as big of a candy bar.
Thank you!  LOL!  Tell me about it.  It can be dangerous having that candy so accessible :).  Hope your doing great.  Nikki
Awww!  Thanks so much Lorita!  So happy you are enjoying my videos and finding them helpful!  Hope all is going great your way and I also send love and happiness your way!  Nikki
What a great idea.  I'm afraid I would gain 10 pounds by having that candy out all the time.  lol  Can you please show us how you do the tags?  Also in one of your videos you showed a decorative paper clip with bling on the top.  Can you show us how you did that?  I'd love to learn!  Thanks for sharing all of your secrets! <3
I so in love with idea as I'm trying to fall asleep I literally see the candy bar in my mind. I keep thinking about etc. Lol
I'm doing well thank you . Sleeping now.  I can't wait to try the candy bar idea. Fun and your was beautifully done.
Thank you.  Was so fun to do :).  Hope your doing great.  Nikki
:).  Thanks for the suggestion.  Totally agree with you on removing the label.
I like  u taking us along with your shopping
Thank you so much!  So glad that you liked and enjoyed my showing the process.  I get so much joy out of making these videos.

Oh my goodness! I love ALL your videos! You are such an inspiration to me and my future home decorations!!!!! Many blessings to you and your family Nikki.  -Melanie
Hi Nikki, is it easy to remove the hot glue when you are ready to change décor?
Thank you so much!  Oh you should definitely do one!  Hope all is going great your way.  Nikki
Very lovely, I will have to do this idea this year
Thank you so much!  So glad that you like.  Nikki

A candy bar, what a great idea, for year round even!  Thanks for the step-by-step instructions from shopping to assembling the candy holders.

Blessings from New Jersey

love your videos and Charleston is so lovely. My relatives are in Ehrhart so we frequent the area often. Love the shopping there . Beautiful decorating nice idea of the candy barlike our mothers use to do for holidays
NOW THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT!  I love bling and I always have candy in a couple of dishes all year long, I will do this for December.  I have never posted photos but I'll try to send you one!  Thanks

Oh my goodness Nikki! How am I just finding out that you have videos. Well anyway I think you are so talented. I think I am going to do one of those for my house. I love the idea. I will try to do it the thrifty way of course. LOL! Thanks for sharing can't wait to get home to watch the rest of your videos.
Nice touch.  I have teenagers so the candy would be gone in a day!  I will have to do this when they are gone to university...LOL
Wow, you are amazing!!!!

Thanks so much.  The ribbon does come off easy.  Most of the hot glue is on the ribbon and some may get on the glass but using hot glue it peels right off.  So excited to hear you will be doing one.  Please let me know how it turns out!  Hope you had a great weekend!

I always look forward to seeing a new video of yours. You have such great ideas. I've even told a few gals at work to watch! Thanks again!

Nichole, I am so glad I found you!! You have such a great sense of style and I love your organ ization. You inspire me!  Love your mirrored chest, btw.
Again this was so inspirational. I live in Tasmania, Australia. Its just gone spring here and I am so jealous that I can't partake in all of the gorgeous autumn goodness I am seeing online at the moment.
Great idea.  My husband loved it too when I showed him.  The only problem is the danger of having that much candy in sight.  LOL!  Great idea for company though!  I'd definitely that.  Thanks!
How fun!  I love all the ideas...that candles and potpourri and vase fillers could be used also.  This has given me lots of ideas, like displaying ornaments at Christmas or placing pretty soaps in a bath.  I love that the look can be changed with various ribbon and embellishments.  Thanks for the great tutorial!
Wow...that is really cute!
Thank you so much!  I am so glad that you like the candy bar!  Hope you have a beautiful weekend.

Thank you so much!  So glad that you liked it!  Hope you have a wonderful weekend.
I am excited to hear how your kid friendly candy bar turns out.  That should be so fun to put together!  When you wrap the ribbon around it should over lap and you actually are putting the glue on the ribbon, not the glass.  Because I used burlap some of the glue will get on the glass but easily peels off because I used hot glue sticks.   Hope this helps.
Awwww...Thank you so much!  So glad that you like it.  I can definitely do a video on how I make the little tags.  Hope you are having a great day.

Awww...Thank you so much!  The purse is the Dora bag by Melie Bianco.  I have a subscription to "Little Black Bag" where I get a bag each month.  This was one of them.  You can find it o nthe Melie Bianco website.  I believe it cost around $100.00 on their site but with my subscription I only paid $45.00 .  Great handbag!

I am currently re-doing my entire first floor and would love some tips on what colors and textures would look great together. I value your ideas and suggestions. You are an inspiration! :)

I am so happy I came across your channel! I love your style and you gave me fantastic ideas! Thank you Nicole! xo
I love it. Nichole you are so talented! Everything what you do is so pretty. God bless and cannot wait to see your next video.
I love the idea! Im gonna try a kid friendly version of this and will see if I can post it here. Quick question though: how do you glue the ribbon without it sticking to the glass? Or does the glue pop off if you push on it when its cold? Im not sure how to proceed with that part.
As always, your ideas are the best.  Looks very classy and much more expensive than it is (always a plus).  I would love to see a video on how you make the tags for the candies.  I am always looking for new ideas.  Beautiful video as always and by the way, you look amazing.  Until next time...
Well don't you look cute in that outfit! Very nice, very sophisticated and ladylike.
very cute as usual you come up with the most fun unique ideas look forward to the next video
Omg. I'm calling Oprah now!!! Give this girl a show!  Just like your laundry room stunned me, I love this idea!  Beautiful job darling!  I will duplicate this in my foyer!

Aloha!
