Hi first time seeing this so cool wanted to know where did you get those bags would love it for my kids too thanks
Love blue
Please, compliment the kids on character qualities… beauty only lasts a moment, character lasts a life time.  They don’t have control over what they look like. They have control over how they behave.  Let’s offer genuine compliments that might MEAN SOMETHING.
Avery looks adorable!
Is that poisonius if it brokes?
How much hours and how long dose it stay cold
The alcohol and water froze solid? Why??
The ice pks turned out really cute
U don’t have rubbing alcohol
such a good idea! and pretty mom
I think Brooke should make twinkle lights what’s up moms
My method: 1. Find a plastic bottle medium size similar to brisk bottles 2. Empty bottle 3. Rinse it in case of drinking  4. Fill with any temperature water but not hot because that would take the longest to freeze 5. Put in freezer for about 24 hours  6. Use makeshift ice pack for every ice pack need 7. When the water melts drink it.  I say it’s a 2 in one use for recyclable plastic bottles.
2:12 😘😘 such a cute expression.
I wish they still used the intros.
I think that the animal pouches are applesauce pouches.
I love how all the kids have a great bond with all the mom's
How is my name Avery and i look almost the same as Avery? Also, amazing video! Avery is so creative!
Avery is so young
Our school nurses need this!
I’m the kid
Where did you get the bags from
How do you make the bags
Hi brooke can you leave the materiel From we’re you got it
Thank you. Just what I was looking for.  And its so simple.
Wow. Thanks. I need to make one for my knee.
This was a really cool video!  Who is like me and almost always doesn’t have the supply’s to make the crafts?
I made these when I was 12 cause I only had one cold compress at home and because of vball, I needed two more. I loved this and it worked really well, I still use this recipe today too :)
Terrible that you would use any container that could be construed as food - no matter what you say!
I thought you where making the drink ice pack
I already have ice pack and my mom brought ice pack in corona virus it’s getting real :ooooo corona virus virus.....
SHES SO TINY EJEJRVRHR
Your belly start in a pot. I don’t mean to be mean.
Funny and useful
Good idea
Super glue to the lid, to make sure the child can’t unscrew it,
Anyone here in quarantine?
Great idea!
my question is why did they add color to the first one if they were going to cover it up with the panda pouch?
Whose here in.......        2  0   2    0
who is watching in 2020 in quarantine?
Ree
It’s almost summer in 2020
What happens when the zip just suddenly opens?
Is this reusable? Like if it lost its coldness, can you still place it in the freezer and will it work the same?
Cool
Are those cute little animal containers meant for drinking? Wouldn’t that be potentially dangerous if a small child got ahold of it and thought it was a treat?
Such a great idea
Wait is avery meg's child not yours no offense but I dont wat h this channel slot but I do love this channel tho
Avery has 1 green eye and 1 blue eye
Wait so making these ice packs to make kids love them that means they wanna get hurt more (NO HATE LOVE THIS IDEA)
1:29 It just spills on the table😂😂😂
I love what’s up moms
Oh my god lincoln so lovely saying" I did too" in the end of the video. bestest words I have ever heard from my ear from a little boy.
I like snow panda
I really like this but I hate pandas
We miss you
2019 anyone?
Sanne  Spike  Pino  Vis 🐠  Vis 🐟  Vis 🎣
Hi
Avery is so cute☺️☺️
That is so cool
Who's watching this 2019  or I am the only one
lol yes she is going back tomorrow morning and she will be back in a little while I’m sorry to hear about her house sorry she was going back in time
So cute
Still a bad idea to use kid attracting pouches!!  Word doesn't always get down to the children.  Go with ziplock bags and since they can be opened put skull and crossbones on the bag before filling.
Perfect because my daughter was hit by a lunch box.
Can you make a squishy
Heck yeah! My family only has hard ice packs that makes bruises hurt more!
Cool
2019 any one
2019 no ok
How I make my own ice pack:   Get a plastic bag (srry VSCO girls) Fill in with tad bit of water Add in ice    DONE
She is soooooooooooooooooooooooooooo beautiful
I  love how everyone is so positive
Were did they buy those icw packs at i want it
So cute 😘 Love u 😘😘😘😘
Avery is so cute😻
So clever! Though I think they should definitely be re-labled in a obvious way so kids don't think it's a drink, because that spells trouble!
Booke is my friends name!!! I luv "Whats up moms"
WORST
2:08 Avery is so adorable!!!
Is anyone a kid but still watching this aka me
At the end Lincoln is so cute✋🏻
1:11 the dogo in the background!!! 😂😂😂😂❤️❤️❤️❤️
I ❤️🐼
Hey
Avery’s eyes are so pretty
I almost lost my tooth
Lunch boxes?? 😳
Can you touch the gel that’s inside with your hands or will it hurt you?
You are a really amazing mom
Im not a mom But i like Watching These kinda stuff XD
Did she was pregnant there???
One of these are going to be made of Dawn
If you use zip lock bags - please go one step further and glue the flaps together after zipping it up.. That way kids can't open them and try to drink them.
Avery's eyes are really beautiful coz' their bluegreen
DIY means "Do It Yourself"
Did brooks leave WhatsUpMoms because it’s been a long time and Now I think  Laura is the craft person now
2018?! (⌒▽⌒)
OMG Avery'z eyes are absolutely PERFECT
If you are wondering who the nicest person is. Read the first and second word.

Avery has very pretty eyed
Love these  😊
Do u have any penguin stuff
I love the videos but this one I’m sorry those drink bags not a good idea. Although she said it. kids are always curious  and may drink the solution.
Wait I thought Avery was Meg daughter
I saw a dog!!🐶
nice home made ice pack
Yea it looks like because your stomach
Awsome
Did anyone see the brownish Mark on Avery's neck?

Love iy
Im from mexico but i looove  ur videos. 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘
Good this help so much
I would never consider using a "really cute little animal pouch", That looks like a good way to poison your child. How long will it take for one of them to open the top and start drinking it thinking it's edible?
Love it! Definitely gonna use this..... for me lol       Pause at 1:12 and you'll get...      A DOGGO!!!!
I have a very cool ice pack/toy for you to try it out and it's fun for kids too all you have to do is put slime in a Ziploc bag and freeze the slime so when the ice pack melts and they feel better and they will have some fun slime to play with
~This my option~ But I think Avery isn't pretty  But thhaaat is my option and I don't wanna any likes comments or anything it's my option that's it
Is Brooke having a baby? 🍼🍼👶👶
1:12 you can see a dog near the sofa on the left just saying hheehehehehe. But at first it crapped me out
it's so cute, but I wonder how long these ice packs stay cool :)
I tried this. It worked very well. I love this diy. Also hi!!!
I’m in second grade
Avery is creative!!!!!!!!!!
So this is what stay at home mom's do all day. Lol jkjk !! ;) I know they work their buyts off
What grade is avery in
Brook seriously needs a daughter
at 1.11 I sow there dog
is it bad I've watched 60% of their videos in a day
Can u drink rubbing alcohol 🍺?
this is actually a great idea with the pouch characters!
Averys eye are the cutest eyes I've ever seen
Hi I just love your YouTube videos
Who is not a mom and still loves watching this
Can we drink it or it's a playing water
Dân Việt đâu😎😎😎

is avery megs daughter
by The Animals zip  lock bags
what to do with that?
They ice packs don't last long ... they thaw quickly
If you don't have access to rubbing alcohol could you use hand sanitizer instead because that has alcohol in it?
1:18 she said to you want to hold it or pour it in and the lip girl said pour it in but for some reason she held it I just noticed that
Or freeze a smoothie or something and use that for a ice pack.
She kinda looks scared of Brooke to me
Is Brooke pregnant
I used mine for my lunch and it leaked all over!
OMG WHAT DO U THINK
I think Avery doesn't really like ice packs like if you agree
I keep getting your ads :)
brooke i love your YouTube channel and i'm only eleven.
this is cool
wow
I made these in a bigger size when my husband had knee replacements. No color but he didn't care. They worked great!
No offence but is she pregnant?
p
Before I even saw this video I thought that I discovered this idea first but no
Avery is so pretty!!
I'm like the only 10 year old that watches this

+WhatsUpMoms Hi Brooke, I have an idea u could do for a video during Halloween or anytime! U could do window clings. Use puffy paint on a parchment paper or ziploc bag to make a design. After it dries u can put it anywhere. I also made bracelets using this method. Put a line of paint on the ziploc or parchment and put the thread on the paint and then make yr design. Let it dry and its done! I luv ur videos! Hope u try these ideas. Thx
Where did you get those pouches Brooke? There so cute!!😄
If you put them in the animal bags, why do you need colour? You don't see it anyway.
Find the difference lol   😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😡😦😧😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😧😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😡😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😟😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😟😦😦😦😧😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦

you can make ice packs by getting a sponge and an zip lock bag put the sponge in the zip lock bag and then put it in the freezer and wait till it's hard and then you got an ice pack

can you use asatoin
avery is lovely
Are you having another baby
thank now I don't have to buy one
Is she pregnant
I saw a dog
Panda!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼
were do you get those zip lock bags
Does it have to be 91 percent rubing Alcohol?
You know, it's not necessarally a DIY because you need someone else to hold the animal pouch, the only way it can be a DIY is if you DO IT YOURSELF
wow
I love this
what are ice packs anyways?
Brooke you should DIY a gold selfie stick!
@Melissa Becker Wtf 🙍
@ALyaNee23 NatSumi0 oops I mean megs
@ALyaNee23 NatSumi03  its elles😊
who's daughter is that?
i want to meet you guys are so nice
I use those food pouches,the animal one to put kool aid or jello or even just any kind of jelly as a cooler in the summer
I made this but when I poured it in the sink in case it spilt
I love your DIYs Brooke!!!
Hot glue the lid on pouched shut

hi Brooke I did those i did blue
Is there anything we can use instead of rubbing alcohol
I love what's up and I think it's the best show ever plus I've seen every episode on your channel
Who else saw Dexter at 1:10?? I did
I love ice gel icepacks
Avery is so pretty her smile is perfect
thats so cute
Maybe you could hot glue the cap onto the baggy so your kids can't open it and there's no chance of spilling. Just an idea 💭
1:14 brooke: do u wanna hold it or pour it in?  Kid: pour it in. Brooke pours it in anyway
Oh my, you are pregnant! Thats sooo adorable! I bet your new child will be adorbsies.
avery is gooorgeous
this may sound weird but your daughter looks like me i dunno
can you see if you can make a stare bux chap stick
Do you know how long the gel pack lasted in the lunch box?
Omg avery is super cute hehehehehe
Lincoln is so cute
💕
How about a morning routine?
When are you due?Brooke
That's actually a really good idea.

How long does it take until it's no longer cold?
My name is Avery too ,!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!😏😎😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😦
I think brook likes meg kids more Brooke invited them over a lot more than Elle she barley spends time with Elle kid no hate
What if your kid accidentally mistakes it for food with those animal packs... I don't think its really safe
Haha, Brooke I just came up with a brilliant/dumb idea.  You should make a belly cast!  Do you like it?  Let me know.
im so glad you put the recipe in the description cuz I always hit my head while playing dodgeball in gym class
OMG!!  Avery is getting big and beautiefull!!
you would be the best mom for a girl and you are the best mom

I was wondering if you can make your own paint. Because if you can, it would save me a lot of time with my siblings and cousins.
Avery looks so much like Meg it's not even funny😍 Like mother like daughter!
Avery is so cute
Can all you and your families do a QnA please
Yesterday was the anniversary of Connie's death

Instead of rubbing achoal
Can u use hydrogen peroxide instead??? Answer fast since I areadly made some.
This is for Elle and maybe Madison or Caroline would be a good name 😂💟💟💟
Elle hasn't been in one in a while I hope she is ok along with the baby
Can you use wash mouth that contains alcohol?
Can you make water marble with candles
do a belly cast

Moms guide to getting your kids dressed

These are adorable! You're such a great mom! 🌞🌞🌞
so cute and cool
This was such a COOL idea for a video....... I'm sorry I just had to! XD         ( Sorry if anybody has already made that joke.)
Avery is so articulate in front of the camera. We definitely have a tiny Youtuber-to-be. :) A question: can one heat up those packs (obviously not in the microwave, but in a bowl of hot water) and use it as a heating pack to soothe cramps?
Avery is so cute!!!!
+whatsupmoms you should take suggestions one week from your audience members and then do episodes based on what the viewers want. You guys are my favorite youtubers!
Sooooooooo cute! Such a good idea.
I'm going to try it ,I hope it works , I love your work you do for videos are you going to give birth Brooke, megan, and elle one of you do text me back. okay
Avery seems to be sweet and smart- I like that! She looks alot like her mom :)
we can use these at our dance studio, kids always get hurt. we love your channel. thanks for inspiring us

Avery looks so cute in this and she's so comfortable with the camera!! I love Lincoln at the end 😂💗💗💗
Hi Brooke, I love all the DIY's.  I was wonder ing if you could make a holiday decor but different than your old one.  Please get back to me as soon as possible. Thanks Sandra Brega

Super neat idea!
Who's Avery  who's daughter

Cute
Avery is so pretty with blue eyes and her hair
Avery is responsible and helpful!!!
Hi I'm so excited for this idea. Thanks +whatsupmoms ( your baby bump is looking awesome!!
CUTENESS OVERLOAD!!!!!!!!
how can 10 people dislike this its so good i love whats up moms
Maybe poor the solution onto a sponge, and then put it in a plastic bag. That way there is minimal leakage.
Avery is so gorgeous! What a fun thing for her idea to be used. She must be so proud :)  Brooke, I would love to see a video on making no-sew fleece blankets in a few different variations. Perfect for fall!
Awww too cute x great video x
Love these videos. You are all so wonderful and make my day a little brighter. Avery, what a smart and beautiful little girl.
Love seeing Avery's personality shine in this!! So cute
I am dying from her,cuteness
Loved this video so much!
💕💕this video was so cute. Avery and the other kids should be in videos more💕💕
even lincoln and avery
Both of them are so cute :)
Avery is so beautiful! Loved this 💗
OMG Avery was soooooo cute in this video!       correction: SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO CUTEE!
Love u so much Brooke
This is a nice idea, I'll try it for my older kids. For my younger ones, I make bean bags out of flannel and dry rice inside. For a no sew option I have ziplock bags of rice in the freezer. We have 'blue ice' for real emergencies but usually all they need is a (r)ice pack.
you should do a Q&A and my first question is how did you start what's up moms
I love how you always include kids. and good luck on number 2
Thank you for being awesome
I made these and gave it to my friend and she loved it and won't leave it alone and when I see her she had it thank you for the good i dea
yay for pandas
I love the kind of gel and I love the cute package that you put it in.
Your kids are always so happy love all the kids laugh xx
Awww bless her she's she beautiful and cute love videos with the kids !!! You are beautiful Brooke love whatsupmoms lol watching your videos it always makes me smile can't wait for your next video
Avery is so beautiful!
when a 5 year old is prettier than you...
Avery is so cute😍
Brooke, I just wanted to say that I am so happy and excited for you, your family and your new baby!!! I wish you all the best!!! Hugs from england!!! Xx P. S. Harrison/Calvin will be so cute just like his big brother!!! Xx
How about some cool jewelry DIYs ??
I love Avery and Lincoln
I found they were one time use with ziploc bags and only an couple more uses out of doubling them. They just leak. The real secret was using breastmilk storage bags. They fit perfectly in kids socks too.
I love the sock idea!
OMG that is like the coolest thing ever plus Avery is all grown up and has way longer hair than me love your channel moms P.S. Did i spell Avery's name right?
Perfect
Avery is such a doll!
Aw, Avery looks so much like her mom!
Another version that I suggest is getting a little sponge and getting it soaked with water and then freezing it in a little ziplock!  The kids at my day care always ask for them.
Aww avery is so sweet
looks like the WUM's will be living on for the generations, what a great idea Avery!
Avery is such a doll! So sweet!!
Awesome idea. Love the pouches.  Brooke, you look so beautiful! hugz
what's a gel ice pack ?
I think Avery is going to be an awesome beauty guru like Bethany Mota when she grows up !
more Avery helping Brooke and Meg please🙏 and also Avery is very pretty 😘😘😍
Hi Brooke I'm 12 years♥ u are very pretty ♥ You inspired me everyday ♥ I love this idea ♥ Love all your DiY's ♥ I make it all ♥ My house look more beautiful ♥ Lincoln is a very cute and sweet boy ♥ P.S: Meg's daughter is so beautiful ♥ Lots of love from me and lots of Kisses for Lincoln ♥

"I did too!" Lincoln cutie pie! Team Harrison, by the way!!!!!
Do u have to use th first one remie achol  thxs x ...
Great idea!
When Lincoln said "I did too" I was like "they grow up so fast oh my god!"
This is so neat.  I like the idea to put it in a sock - that's a hack right there!  I often wrap them in a towel but it never stays put.
omg i love you guys and im only  10
His so cute
Avery has grown so much!! what a great idea for a DIY gel ice pack!!
