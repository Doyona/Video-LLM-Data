Ok
I'm from the UK, How much is 1 1/2 cups of water in millilitres, thank you.
You are so beautiful, love the bread and rolls recepie💯🫶🏻
Can you use this for hot dog or hamburger buns?
My fingers are crossed, am waiting for the oven to get to temp.  Nothing to feed the yeast though..trusting the process...I hope they grow a bit while baking.  Just took mine out of the oven . no color whatsoever...  What the heck?!
I always loved her show and now I love her videos ❤❤❤
Miss Jenny I do enjoy watching your videos although I don't try every one of them  I just want to say that I enjoy your your videos you have such a loving spirit. This recipe I Idefinitely will make,  I used to watch you all the time decades and decades ago on your TV show I wish you were back love you Miss Jenny. P.S your personality is amazing you can see the joy and love ❤️ in what you do.
So happy that you’re using American measurements🇺🇸 Going to the kitchen right now❤️‍🔥  Thank you very much.  And God bless our America
I enjoy your presentation! And your recipes are great. Easy peasy and delish! cheers
I can't wait to make these!  Great video too!
Something doesn’t compute, you’re using a 1/4 teaspoon of yeast, yet you’re holding up a package of yeast. And a teaspoon of salt. I think the measurement of the yeast amount is not correct. Is it possible to clarify that?
This is a pain to mix!  Not as easy as said in this video
You are so adorable!  God bless you.
Traduci. In italiano. X favore. .
You’re wonderful!!!❤❤❤❤❤
Why not addmore flour at beginning
I have a chuckle here every so often-on&off over the yrs I've tried to care to be organized&wrote my favs in a lovely  book-well that's yrs ago now I realized all of Jenny's I've had less do overs so I just keep going back on&doing esp my breads-your egg on the chest still gets a smile but the book is lost in a dusty corner so don't leave! OH Flatten your 20min pizza dough oil top put Arab spices or bagel ones&finger indent top oven375on parchment&authentic Lebanese or Turkish flats-So I was told&wasn't believed till my age gals made it&raved
Made them!  So easy and so delicious... like one of the people posted, they weren't out of the oven 30 seconds and I've already eaten two of them. I put some butter on the buns and devoured.... they are perfect.
Wow!!! No oil or butter? Great!
Gluten n yeaat free recipe?
This bread was pretty good  🎉
I tried your bread and it did fine until I baked it. It didn’t rise. It was pretty flat
Me too love what about whole  wheat  bread for diabetic patients
My oven takes less than 10 minutes to preheat. Am I hearing that yr oven takes 35 minutes?  Just curious
Finally, someone has a way to make crispy bread. I’m having girls over for my homemade soup and these rolls are going to be perfect. I love love love your kitchen. I think we have something in common all the bright colors make us happy thank you thank you. 🤡
Ms. Jenny. I pray you're well. I reviewed your channel & you haven't any recent videos for apprx 7yrs. I pray you're well. Perhaps you IF you are inclined, you can create some new ones for the Holidays? Of course it's only a request. Bless you always 🙏.  Paz be with us all 🙏.  "Sra lsa"
Gosh, this was 10yrs ago & this vid popped up. Padre God be Praised 🙏. I'm not a baker & we love bread, sadly in moderation. However, some a month is better than none. I shall get back to you once I gave it a try. You're so bubbly too. Bless you! Paz be with us all 🙏. "Sra lsa"
Jenny gets straight to it 🌺
Wonderful.  Thanks, Jenny.
Do you put water in the ovan
I am so happy to see this recipe. It is really easy. Thanks for sharing. I will definitely try it. Greetings from Jamaica 🇯🇲
I hope your doing just fine. You haven't posted anything in a long time. Here's hoping your ok. I loved all of your videos.
You’re funny Jenny!  I’m going to make your delicious looking rolls.😊
You should never use hot water from your tap for cooking it’s gross 😮
So happy I found your channel on YouTube.  I used to watch you all the time on Food Network.  We are currently in Central America but I am subscribing to your channel so I can watch more videos.
Look delicious but do they have to be eaten same day? Not a joke.
I love bread
I made them and they were wonderful. I’m an experienced bread baker and with no knead. I do let them ferment overnight and use just 1/4 tsp yeast.
I like to squish half a handful of grated cheese into the bun while shaping them before the oven then seal it up and crack black pepper over them. Maybe slice a knife through the top so the cheese leaks…
Your simply the Best just an amazing woman ❤😊
I followed her directions and the dough didn't do anything. What went wrong? I started another one and hoping that it will work out.
I love to watch you bake and I love your humor❤️
Made them a few times, great recipe. Will make it again this evening ! Thank you Jenny
Watching and did this recipe today, July 5th 2025! Great recipe and love Jenny 🩷
Are you not doing any more videos?????
You do silly😂😂😂😂
‘Are you happy with your buns?’  Very … cheeky … Jenny… 😉
Made these rolls again today, probably 4-5th time, always with great results.  Unfortunately, today I was almost out of bread flour, so went ahead & used AP.....disaster!!.....Just took rolls from oven...They did not rise like before, prior to going in oven & the results were mini-bowling  balls.....I won't make this mistake again....Like the old adage "if it ain't broke - don't fix it"!!....I won't make ever again unless I have plenty of bread flour on hand!....
I could be happy with your Buns ❤
Maam, your spirit is funny in a good way! I enjoyed this video and gonna give it a try for this recipe. Greetings from Kerava, Finland! 🥰
I think I missed something. I followed the steps but my dough didn't rise and the rolls didn't puff. It still tasted good but too crusty on the outside. Any tips?
Hi Jenny, it was watching your video on making a bread loaf that got me into bread making. So easy and so therapeutic. I have even started adding grated cheddar cheese and sun dried tomatoes to the mix. Will definitely give your rolls a go. Many thanks. Xnigel (UK).
Thank you very much ❤❤❤
I made yours buns but they turn out hard. What did I do wrong?
🤣
I made these today. They were a total hit with the family and they tasted amazing. However, although the texture was perfect, they looked anemic and didn’t have the golden color that yours have. I guess it doesn’t really matter as long as they taste good
Yummy!⭐️👍⭐️👍
Doesn’t really hot water kill yeast?
I’m a vegan  Wot can I brush them with instead of egg white pls?
I have an old cast oven .Dutch oven? Can I use that one ?
lol!  You are too much fun!🙏👑♥️
I’m making these rolls now.
❤😊
Shes a comic + cook😂 love the teeth!😂❤
I’m going to try this. I love crusty bread!
Love it. Thanks
Made these last night and they were delicious!
But you mixed up all the ingredients so you "KNEADED" the bread. You cannot make NO KNEAD BREAD because kneading means to "MIX"
I’m going to be baking all afternoon & evening. I have a huge pot full of delicious vegetables & beef on the stove simmering. These rolls will be a wonderful addition along with a nice salad. I’m making a peach cobbler for a yummy dessert as well. It’s so wicked cold out so this will be a lovely supper on a Saturday night. Thank you, Jenny. You’re the best cook ever. I only wish I’d had you & your knowledge 30-40 years ago. I’m so very thankful for now. God Bless You, Sweetheart. 🙏✝❤
Don’t add hot water ever !
You are awesome ! No frills, can continue work whatever only 3 steps to baking , hallelujah. I will try it tomorrow. THANK YOU  GOD BLESS YOU snd your utube buisness a d family.❤
Rapid fast yeast is for bread machines
So you don't need sugar to activate yeast?
I have a question ! My artisan bread comes out beautiful but next day is so hard it breaks your teeth ! Out side bread takes much longer to get that hard 🤷🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️
where to by your flour board?
Going to try making these this week
Love you Jenny.  God bless your pea picken heart
Uhhh… If you have a conventional hot water  (with a standand tank), you shouldn’t use hot water from the tap to drink or cook with. Excess metals from the hot water tank tends to leach into the hot water. Better to heat up water from the water tap in a kettle or microwave.
Video 10y old and im new to baking bread 🥖
I just made your no knead bread tonight and it was Excellent!!! Making these rolls tomorrow.
I just came here after searching for a no-knead bread roll recipe and IS THAT JENNY JONES? Jenny Jones who I used to sneak into a classroom to watch The Jenny Jones show during highschool? I'm glad you're here, Ms. Jones! Nice to see you!
❤
“Caldo e croccante”!
Annoying to have to change websites to get full recipe
Wait, i love her is she still making videos? She is beautiful too
I am making these...yum! They puffed up and looking good! still waiting for the baking to end, as I write this. Going to make some coffee!
I love Jenny she is the best 😊
Can you make a crusty whole wheat out of this? Love your recipes 🥰
I obviously have a very budget stove because I’d burn anything to a crisp if I set my oven to 450. 🥲. Maybe I’ll try 375.
I love you and your cooking 😊
OMG!  Jenny Jones!  I ❤ it!  I can’t believe I found an easy way to make bread 🍞 after watching so many YouTube tutorials and I found Jenny Jones and this is the best and to the point!  😊
Never seen a bread dough that sticky, but know that it would make the inside very soft.  Thanks. Gonna try it this weekend.🌷
I can't wait to try to make these!!
Are you happy with your buns!!! And she is making rolls, buns are a cake, bread is bread.
I love your buns Jenny, and I love your rolls too…
❤
I like your recipe, but your shaping technique could use improvement. Not criticism  just they would come out more round
You have to be the best.  Thank. Perfect each time thank.  Yes JENNY CAN BAKE. !
Honestly 😂these are worse ever seen pancakes. What a joke,I can't even fold them
I've been making this recipe for about 8 years.  It's my favorite roll recipe. I like a sturdier roll with chew, more than the squishy  kind of rolls.  Sometimes I use the dough to make sub buns, flavoring them with rosemary and using them for meatball sandwiches.  The sturdier bread hold up extremely well to all those meatballs and sauce.  Other times I dust the tops with a bit of rice flour for decoration, or spray the tops with water and add coarse salt and caraway, poppy seed, plain caraway, or just coarse salt.  They really are delicious.  Great with a bowl of soup.  Once I had a roll left over that I had forgotten about.  I ended up cutting it into cubes and toasting them in a fry pan with a little olive oil and garlic.  It made the best croutons ever.
Hi there ever since I saw you making those rolls, I haven't stopped making them they're excellent!!! Thanks for sharing it 😊
Look like the mom on happy days. I figured it out.
Thanks.😊
What do you mean? You can start this the night before. If you use cold water after 8 and 12 hours of resting in the morning. Are you talking about when you added the hot water to mix it to use cold water. And what do you mean after 8 and 12 hours of resting after you mix it, it rests for 8 to 12 hours. And how does that pertain to the morning or the night before? This makes no sense
It is 12:00 here. After your video was over, my stomach growled.
I’m making these with my oldest child today to use for some porchetta sandwiches for dinner. Fingers crossed they turn out as good as yours.
Nice & simple recipe, I would like to try these bread rolls. Thanks for sharing the recipe Jenny.
Delicious! Thank you
Love this channel!
AND!!! The sleeves are sweeping the table top clean!!
Hi Jenny. I made these rolls today. I did follow you recipe. Exactly. While they do taste delicious. Mine came out so hard on the outside. What did I do wrong. Please help if you can. Thank you.
Thank you Jenny. You are never boring.  Made your bread for my whole family.  They absolutely loved it. Thank you again. 💕💕
I am going to make these rolls. Jenny you are definitely the best.
Absolutely wonderful recipe just like you
I love your videos!!
“Are you happy with your buns?” Oh guffaw!!!
lol I was like that look like that talk show host lol lol
For overseas persons , might , convert ,Fahrenheit to Celsius ..otherwise brilliant .
I would like all the ingredients in grams...
Good job jenny
Hey Jenny, its totally okay if u cant answer all those questions. Just wanna say that i am a great fan of ur sick but fine humor! (those teeth at the end got me HAHAHAHA!)  And ofc of ur receipes! This time am headin for those rolls! Have a great day! 🙂
Omg! Is this lady Martha Stewart's twin sister? ❤❤❤
Jenny a big thank you for this recipe. My family enjoyed it very much. I also baked your whole wheat bread and they loved it too. Next I am looking for some organic unwaxed lemons to make your lemon brownies. looking f looking l
I love the recipe and will certainly be trying it. But…why does your oven take 35 min to reach 450?
Just made these tonight and they are delicious. I used just under a teaspoon of the yeast instead of a quarter teaspoon. I brushed them with butter before baking them and they are nice and crunchy outside but bread like and soft inside. Can’t eat too many because of the carbs
Omg this recipe is amazing.  So simple and they are delicious. Thanks so much Jenny for your excellent instructions as well the little hints were perfect.   I made homemade ham bean soup and these rolls and shared with my 80 yr old neighbor:   She raved about these buns ‼️.   This is now one of my favorite buns for sure ❤
Jenny, I am watching your videos, baking bread and buleczki (my grandson ate them plain, all in one day) I love your videos  because you make it easy and fun. Silly lady. ♥️🌹I adore you and your colorful spatulas 👍🏻
Can you add cheddar cheese to those rolls.
Followed everything exactly. Major fail. Dough was liquid no matter how much flour
These rolls are wonderful!  I made them last night and they really are very easy to make!
Protect her at all costs. Incredible channel.
I messed up because I grabbed the wrong bag of flour. I accidentally put self-rising flour and so it came out too salty because I added the teaspoon of salt. I think I made tennis balls 😂 I'm going to try this again tomorrow with all-purpose flour and perhaps half the salt LOL
Can u double the recipe for the bread?
35 minutes to get to 450 degrees?  That's a longggggg time!
Made these tonight....Great simple recipe....My dinner plans changed..So, I baked them, letting them cool. Then I'll wrap them in foil and freeze them. 5 minutes in a hot oven and they will be same as freshly baked. Thanks, Jenny!   (Had to test one, so good)
i still love your smile. thanks
You are fantastic, best rolls I have ever made or tasted, ate all 8 in one sitting....Thank you so much!!!
I added 1/2 tsp sugar and replaced 1c of flour with 1 c of almond flour to kick up the fiber and protein and they always turn out perfectly!!
Love this recipe, never fails. I substitute 1c almond flour for 1 of the cups of wheat flour, and add 1/4 tsp of sugar. They bake perfectly.
I tried this and wasn't really happy with the results. So I then made two more batches, but doubled the yeast and added a tbsp of baking soda to one and a tbsp of powder on the other.  WAY better result!!
Love this lady!
Thank you so much❤
Greetings from Australia. Thank you, gave them a go and loved them, they are now on our regular bread baking list. Just one thing, why can't America be like the rest of the world and use celsius?
I just made your Crusty Bread Rolls and they puffed up so beautifully. Thankyou so much, Jenny dear.
Are you happy with your buns…too cute!! 😂
You have such a great personality, I love watching your videos!🤗
I'm a good cook and dessert baker, but really intimidated by bread. These, however, are super easy and totally delicious. My 5 year old likes helping me make them (although they're SO easy that there's little for him to even help with!). I like to substitute whole wheat flour for the last half cup.
I question the “very hot” part of the water description?  Really?  Hot kills yeast. Maybe baby-bath water type hot. Maybe not hot, hot. What other thoughts are available?  Luv you Jenny. Happy Baking.
Jenny, I'm making these right now.  I know I can do it, but I'm fairly certain I've done something a bit wrong.  After I removed the towel, they don't look anything like yours.  They look more like what you'd have when making biscuits.  But they're in the oven, so we'll see how they turn out.  If not, I'll do it again in a week or so.
Made these twice in one week, they are that good!
Would it work  with whole wheat flour?
Anyone looking for the easiest and most awesome recipe for rolls, THIS IS IT! These are incredible! Trust me, you will not believe how good these are. You can even divide this into 4 pieces and make sub rolls. Very versatile. I wish Jenny would come back and do more recipes. She is so funny and makes cooking fun! I absolutely love her.
Yum! Luv you Jenny! You make everything look so easy to make and really yummy. ❤😋
I love this , you are awesome ❤️    I have been trying one recipe after another😊❤ they are all so good, thank you
Has anyone tried dry yeast? I cannot get fresh yeast where I live. Thank you
These look great & so is your beautiful smile. 🥰
Why does Jenny say not to put in a warm place, just on counter? I want it to rise a bit faster???
Though they look good,  as a nutritionist I want to point out that the flour you used has no nutritional value,  so you are making nutrient deprived bread.
🍅🍆🥔🥕🌽🌶🫑🥒🥬🥦🧄🧅🍄🥜🍞🥐🥖🫓🥨🥓🥩🍗🍖🧀Yummy yum!!! Waving from south Georgia!👋
Oi , sou aqui do Brasil e adoro pão.        Essa receita deve ser uma delícia .      Na primeira oportunidade eu vou fazer.        A sua generosidade foi muito grande.  🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗        Muito obrigado por passar o seu conhecimento.         Que Deus te continui te abençoando.          A coisa mais sagrada nesse mundo é O pão.           Praticamente é a primeira refeição.
Just wandering how come hot water doesn't kill the yeast?
This is fantastic! Question: these days I prefer to stay away from white bread but go with whole wheat. I assume the process would be similar but what kind of flour should I get? I'm a very beginner when it comes to baking bread. Thank you.
Jenny come back! More videos pls
Flour 320 gr, water 300 gr ? It is very high hydration compared to all types of bread I bake (I admit I have only baked sd breads, max 75% hydration).  But your dough looks like I can handle :). Is this because the water is warm ?  And thank you, they look very good.
I love the way you quick and easy  thanks ❤😅
Jenny, do you have recipe for natural light polish rye bread without molasses. !
"almost no work at all, bitches."
😍
Can you cook these in an Airfryer?
I am so glad you didn't have us wait the three hours for the dough to rise!😊 I will definitely try these. Your pizza dough recipe was perfect! Now I can make pizza at home any way I like it. These rolls will be great for burgers and holidays. You are a blessing!
Hot water kills the yeast. How hot are you asking for.
I love the precise instructions.  This lady is like a breath of fresh air.  No boring commentary like the majority of cooking videos.  Love it
Babeolicious. Oh, the loaves look really good.😊
What a perfect cook
ohh my! this is what i need to do anytime from now...(frm the philippines)
Oh dear.. I've been making your no knead bread for a few years now. I love that thing and now rolls? I foresee a yummy fest!! 😋❤
Hi from Quebec, Canada. Making this recipe now😀
you are so silly :) Thanks! For your sharing.
I tried this last night.  Used half organic whole wheat and half AP flour.  it was a home run.  trying the loaf of bread today  This was delish healthy and fun to make.  Goes great with sanwiches and would make a great dinner roll.  Thank you
Loved your video, and you are beautiful too.
Unfortunately, I had to add way more flour. Probably too much water in the recipe.
Jenny you're such a laugh and I love your multi coloured kitchenware! Everyone loves the Dutch oven loaf, so now it's time to try these!!
Made these today! They were a hit!   Thank you!  👍🏼♥️👍🏼
Hi Jenny , thanks for the tutorial on ciabatta buns,You are great ,I can bake ! 🤙🇨🇦🪶☺️
A pan of water on bottom rack makes them even better
I have made these and the no knead bread in the Dutch oven so many times and I never Tire of watching Jenny's videos
Can I bake this rolls in Air Fryer?  PLMK. Thanks
Thanks Jenny good recipe 😋!
I'm very happy with my buns !
En español castellano por favor
Not sure where I went wrong but following your ingredients and measurements my dough was not as thin as yours. I’m waiting for the 3 hours now so let’s see what happens. Thanks for the post!
🌸🌳🌻🌼🌺🌴💮🌾🍂🍃🌱🌷
I just love all your recipes,there easy to follow,and your comments are funny.hope you make more videos 😊

Thank you! What a wonderful recipe, no frills, just what we need!
Are you happy with ur buns? Great opening! So I decided to watch the whole video. Now I have some new ingredients added to my shopping list.
Amazing 🌷
This recipe is awesome! Thanks for sharing. I may never buy frozen rolls again!

Im so grateful for your sharing! Thank you Beautiful lady💖
How do you keep from scarfing down the entire batch in one sitting?
👏👏
I hv been looking for the easiest no knead style of bread making  and I'm so happy to find yours.  Your recipe uses the least ingredients also 😅. I tried it out today and I'm so happy with the end result. Thank you so much for sharing your video.
Looks amazing will try them now. Thank you for sharing.

Soooooo happy I can across your recipe!! Easy and AMAZING rolls about to make yet another batch! Thank you x
WTF why am I only seeing this channel now in 2023!? Hi Jenny! I need a makeover! Jones/Lake 2024
How do I  keep them from getting hard so quickly???
OMG! I just made this today for lunch, I used the overnight proofing as it's for today's Scottish Campfire Stew. It's absolutely delicious! I used the Wholemeal (Whole Wheat) Flour that hubby mistakenly bought (I asked for Plain/All-purpose flour) this is my very first attempt at bread-making! And your recipe had given me the encouragement to continue! Thank you! Love from England  🇬🇧 ❤️
The crunchiness all the way around is to die for.
I need to make them. I was looking for buns . Thank you so much why I didn't found you earlier. ❤😊
Thanks for the recipe , it is the easier and best to follow, and they taste yummy!
Buns that are crusty or crispy? No way. I like them like most men do: soft, bouncy, warm  😍🤩
Third try yesterday, I followed the recipe exactly, even aerated the flour.  This time I had the oven hot enough, 450º.  Everything looked great up to baking time.  Looked just like Jenny's dough when I made the rolls.  But?  They wouldn't rise at all when baking, just about an inch or two.  We are at 4,239' above sea level.  Is there an adjustment I need to make to get them to rise up and not look like cowpies?  LOL
My husband and I absolutely LOVE  this bread! It makes for great toast as well!
I watched this video with anticipation,  then you got me with the SMILE😁... To funny🤣 Thanks for the recipe🏆
I love your cooking, because it is easy and tasty. Thank you.
Than goodness for you Jenny - I love your recipes and your videos. You have re-ignited my enthusiasm for baking :)
I have never seen anyone with the same granite countertop as mine!  So pretty with your white cabinets though mine are cherry. It's striking. Thanks for the recipe. Can't wait to try it!
I followed the recipe step by step and my biscuits came out hard and salty. UGH
Too much talking
Can you make just one or two loaves?  thank you.
jenny! jenny! jenny!
You're the cutest! I love your video and can't wait to make these. ❤
I mix the salt into the flour so yeast does not have direct contact
Tried it again.  My oven temp wasn't hot enough last time, also I aerated the flour and measured better.  They came out MUCH better, but not HOLEY inside and as crisp as Jenny's.  Our indoor temp is 68º or less in the kitchen in the winter, so maybe less rising?  They were so good this time, but I'll try again and keep the dough in a bit warmer place.   Thanks for the tips!  :)
😱♥️♥️♥️♥️ se ven delicioso el pan Gracias
👍🤗👌🤗🥰🙏🇧🇧
I was waiting for your joke was almost sad until the end😂😂😂❤it
Im gonna make them today look amazing
I have never had any luck with breads. Can’t wait to try these
Less talking more cooking please
You should help the yeast by adding sugar as well. Salt is not a friend for fungus.
Lekkerŕ
Is it possible to make them a little larger for sandwiches? Perhaps NOT cutting them into 8 pcs?
Thank you so much, you always make this look so easy (it is!😊) and you present it well. I haven't been able to knead dough  for years due to health problems, so I'm really looking forward to trying this and having home made bread again!
Hello chef. Can you make bread with beats. Thank you so much. Have nice day.
Love Jenny's recipes.
OMG theses were so easy to make and incredibly delicious. I ate 6 at one sitting. And clean up was a breeze. Absolutely give them a try. Thanks Jenny
Can we add other ingredients to this recipe,

Delicious and super easy to make. Thank you for the recipe!! 🌞🌿
Unfortunately, especially after reading comments, these were rock hard. Could not break open, couldn't cut with serrated knife. So disappointed, love yeast rolls.
help?  I love this recipe. Tried last night. But my dough was not wet like hers with 1 1/2 cup of water.  I added a bit too much to make it moister like hers, but after 3 hrs resting it looked exactly like hers before baking.  But the rolls didn't rise?  Was my oven too hot or cold?  Why didn't they rise?  Thanks anyone.
Is that 1 package of yeast?
Ok Jenny, your! website is down
Awesome. THANKS for a great recipe!  Can u bake this in a loaf pan after a 2nd longer rise?
Greetings from Australia Jenny - hope you are well. It may be 4 years since you uploaded anything but be assured, those that are there are giving me such immense pleasure, esp your lovely smile and fun approach to baking. Love so many of your recipes, but esp your no knead breads - everyone loves my 'artisan' and ciabatta loaves - awesome to do the overnight proofing method and just bake next morning.  Thx again ❤️
I made these..small ,hard ,terrible..what did I do wrong
Can you freeze these as there are only two of us x
Still love Jennys Bread!
I’m going to give this a try because it looks so good and easy, but I’m hesitating using hot water from the faucet. Is this just “warm” water that comes out first or REALLY warm water? My hot water comes out at 130°F almost as soon as I turn it on. I always heard that a temperature above 115°C kills the yeast.
Thank you Jenny, I love uour videos, I used to watch your show back in the day. It is so good to see you on these videos with your big smile, and your light beautiful soul. God bless you ❤
I made your bread the other day... easy and SO GOOD!! I'll bake your rolls tomorrow.... thanks so much!
I have been making The No Knead Crusty Bread now for over a year. My neighbors are all in Ahhh!!! They think I am a God.  I also have added Sun-Dried Tomatoes, Monterey Cheese cubes and Minced Onion during the mixing portion of the recipe and let it sit for 4 to 5 hours before baking.  Everyone Loves it.   Thank You Jenny - You Are The Best! 🙂🙂🙂
No sugar!  What does the yeast feed on?
I love bread it's my downfall
Ok, so I’m not agreeing with the ‘doesn’t matter what kind of yeast, active dry, or any other…I never noticed a difference.’ I used active dry and the dough didn’t rise AT ALL. I went step by step, I mean it’s pretty simple and I’m not a beginner. So I was a bit disappointed. I’ll get the exact yeast she’s using the next time. I’m now trying to safe this dough base that didn’t rise, made another pool so I don’t have to throw it away.
I WORRY ABOUT ALL THE PLASTIC WRAP!!!!!!!
love the ending.😂😂😂 love ur sense of humor❤❤
Love this - you actually make it seem easy enough for me to want to try to make these delicious looking rolls myself! Thank you!
Also works in Denmark 😁👍
Hey, this was great. Those turned out very nice. I tried to make rolls yesterday and they were somewhat failure. They tasted pretty okay but I do have some learning to do. Thanks 👍
that was fun to watch!
Thank you 🙏🏾 I been making artisan bread but never made this kind of buns , looks easy and similar to my artisan bread 🤷🏼‍♀️
I can't wait to try them! I have a nuwave oven to bake in, so I'll have to only do half at a time, should I leave the other half of the dough on the counter or refrigerate? I can't really preheat the nuwave, but it heats up almost instantly. I usually throw a little water on the bottom of the oven when making bread to help insure the humidity to help make the crust. I will be trying mine with butter and a little honey.....yummmm
Egg yolks are good for scrambled eggs!!MMM
All the measurements are in a measurement that is understood in the other 197 countries in the world and then we get to the water. Measured in flangoonian cups
Good one with the fake teeth. Going to make these right now!
Yum easy🎉🎉🎉🎉
These are so easy even I can do it.
JENNY JONES!!!!!
450f too hot. Mine burned in 15 minutes. 😢 I have a thermometer in the oven, so I know it’s fairly accurate.
So I tried doing the dough overnight by using cold water instead of hot, but the dough didn't end up looking like Jenny's after she placed the cling wrap over the bowl. I second guessed myself and added 1/2 cup of water because everything looked too dry. The only thing left is to see how the dough turns out tomorrow. Hopefully it'll taste ok after baking. This is my first attempt at bread and wishing for the best 😅  Edit: They turned out great surprisingly! Crunchy and crisp on the outside, and chewy on the inside!
It takes her oven 35 mins to preheat?? Is she messing with us?
these would be great with tuna: I wanted to make a fairly quick tuna sandwich so I used what I had,  albacore tuna  [ 1 can ],1/4-1/3 cup Renee's Poppy Seed dressing, 1 green onion [using mostly just the very light green and white parts] finely chopped, some black pepper to taste; 2 slices Portofino  sourdough bread slices [ the 810 gr ]  or this wonderful bread;  becel or butter; mix the first 4 ingrd. together, butter bread, spread the tuna mix, then enjoy! Barbecue chips tastes great with this :)  this is quick and simple, but very tasty :)
I miss Jenny. 💔
Beauty! Can we do this with whole wheat flour?  What would you do differently?
This is really good.
5:51 Can't wait for the homemade butter! I'll have to try this recipe. Thank you.
This recipe is wonderful! I made it all the time in the spring of 2021, and thank goodness it was fairly easy to find again! I am subscribed now so I will never lose another one of your amazing recipes!
Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe and so many fascinating details in your bio. Happy New Year, and may God bless you for all the good that you do.
3hrs w/hot water; 0ver night w/cold water
Definitely
GIRL! I'm muey impressed! (Yes-yes...the recipe is superb..BUT)...Not a single puff of flour on your gorgeous yellow top! LOL Me...yeah - even after 50 years (I'm in my 60s) of baking, a successful project means mess.   THANK YOU! Blessings
Thank you 😊
I make these at least once a week they’re delicious. Sometimes I’ll throw onion cheese and black olive on them. Tasty.
Thank you very much. I love your récites. I subscribed despite having difficulty understanding English.  I am Francophone.  I watched the video well and understood how to make the buns and they are delicious.💝💖
I only use her bread recipe exclusively!  I love her recipes, so easy.  ❤️❤️
Oh, hello there new favorite cooking channel. Hello Ms. Jones, I remember you! Subbed.
I love your Since of humor
They get softer as they cool down..!!! Thank You for recepie ☺️👍🏼
this looks so good!!! Totally gonna make them!
👏👏👏👌👌🌹🌸🌺🌻💐
Thank you, jenny, for the awesome bread roll recipe I tried and my rolls came out perfect . My husband and I absolutely loved them they were scrumptious.
Can I use  whole wheat flour instead?
I made these this afternoon and they turned out brilliantly. Thank you.
They are totally wonderful. Love them. Mine do not come out round after being baked, they are a little flat, what am I doing wrong.
I LOVE BREAD!
😂🤣 You're a goofball!!! Love it!  Love your videos and recipes!
I can only imagine what beauty you were in your twenties when you are so beautiful now.
I need to know why I'm not getting notifications on you.❓
JENNY COME BACK!!!!!❤
These rolls are amazing I made them ❤😂
The hardest thing is to wait for 3 hours .
Ohhhhh.....
Ha ha ha. That was funny.  Thank you for the recipe!!!!!! They look yummy!!!!!
This recipe makes great hot dog buns too - just shape them in skinny oblongs - works every time.
I LOVE BREAD!!! 😄 my mom used to make bread every week, a huge batch.  We never had store bought bread till we were older. She took a picture of me when I was about 2, walking with a loaf of bread and taking a bite out of it.  The holidays are coming, I'm gonna make our bread rolls this year. Yummy thanks for the easy video anyone can do.
You can make this the night before instead of hot water, use cold water? And let it rest to 8-12hrs only on the counter top. Does it mean you don’t need to put inside the fridge😮.
These are so easy and delicious, I've made them several times. I started throwing a heaping  Tbls of my sourdough starter discard in... yum! Thanks Jen
No NEED to KNEAD…
Doesn't very hot water kill yeast?
There's just something about a girl in pigtails!  Thanks so much Jenny, I'll definitely be serving these this upcoming holiday season!
My dough is not loose like yours. I did it just like you did...my dough is not
Hi Jenny! I just love your videos! Thank you <3 Do you think it would be ok to brush these with garlic and Italian seasonings to use with a pasta dish? Would you just use a little olive oil as your carrier?
I was just thinking what beautiful teeth you have then you pulled that stunt...i needed that laugh and these rolls! Thanks Jenny.
Love you
These are great!  I make them  all the time for my family and friends and they all really enjoy them. Sometimes I make honey butter to go with them.  This recipe never fails as long as the yeast is fresh. Jenny, thanks for sharing this recipe.
Just baked rolls using ur recepie. My kids just loved it. Thank you!
Good job Jenny well done! 💗🥰🙏
They look amazing
Why no sugar or butter?
Oh Jenny I love this channel. Thank you so much.
the ending lmaoo i love Jenny💓
I feel the love. Jenny you are such a giver. Thank you for your love. You are vivacious.
my convection microwave oven will only go to 200c ...what can I do Please?
they look Cool.  Hope I can buy a Scraper like yours
can I use Rye Flour please?
These are just bloody awesome!
Watching it and follow the instructions in 2022
I’m going to do this.    Bakeries around here have stopped making them.    Thanks for posting this!
Thank you very much 🙏🏻🌹🌹🌹
No yeast?
I will always be a Jenny fan.. years and years of following her!
Yummy thanks for sharing 👍
Just made the Dutch oven bread. BTW I love you pocka dotted apron. Hubby says it's  distracting.
Jenny, the "Show More" written recipe says preheat oven to 325 degrees, but you say in the video to heat your oven to 450 degrees and that your oven takes about 35 minutes to do such; really slow in my opinion. God bless!
I want to try this. Can I add raisins nuts and seeds in the dough or would it affect the rise?
Jenny, I think the written recipe and directions contain a contradiction as to oven temperature! :-)
made them some months back, and they were great! about to make a bunch again, as I want to have 🍔 or two.
Love your video and I printed it off and going to make them today!
Nice and beautiful 😍
Jenny you crack me up and girl your skin is amazing you look young no lie you look the same as you always have! What sorcery is this ? I would like to learn this magic method of staying youthful..if it comes by the jar i will need no less than 2 barrels full so that i may soak myself entirely in that youthful magic potion Miss Jenny! Lol. Have a great day sweet wonderful woman. Im back to get another recipe as usual you are my recipe go to Guru!
Yummy 😋  I'm glad I find you 😋  Thank you Jenny 😋
Good grief, do I miss this woman! I really wish that she would come back again!
Thank you such an easy recipe, I’m going to do it today. This is my first time, hope I’m ok. Love the teeth!
It takes your oven 35 min to heat up? And you let the dough rest for three or more hours? The longest bread preparation ever. Gonna try it but in half the time. Will see
Por favor , traduza p nossa linguagem  Português   Brasil
Ingredients: 2 1/2 c of flour(bread flour or all purpose) 1/4 tsp yeast 1 tsp salt 1 1/4 c hot water  Directions: 1. stir together the dry ingredients then add the hot water and mix until combined 2. cover the dough with plastic wrap for 3 hours to let the dough rise 3. uncover the dough and lightly need it on a clean floured surface. Then divide and shape the dough into rolls and put them on a parchament lined baking sheet.  4. cover the shaped rolls with a towel(do this before  preheating the oven!). Then preheat the oven to 450 degrees F . Once the oven is done heating up uncover the rolls and put them in the oven for 20 minutes.
I made the rolls they were perfect love to watch u doing u r Fanny
Goodness dear,  those outfits.....You look irresistibly beautiful. Also  your ponytails.?  Very cute. Even your sweet smile.
Yummy!  These will be good for French dip sandwiches!  🥖
I made this bread today and it was a hit! Thank you Jenny!
I don’t know about this. I did exactly as the instructions but the mixture seems too dry.  2.5 cups of flour, 1/4 teaspoon of yeast, teaspoon of salt, 1.25 cups of water.  And no plastic wrap so I covered it with foil.  We will see tomorrow morning in 8 hours.
I love your enthusiasm love it❤️🌹
Love 💗 Love 💗 This recipe!! Thank You for sharing it! I make this allllll the time Now!
Thank you gave me another grandpa superpower!
You're my favourite, Jenny.
Thank u very much I am not good in bread baking but I have tried this and it came out jummy. From South africa
That's weird for an oven to take that long to heat up...seems like a lot of gas or electricity.
Peut-on faire avec farine petit épeautre (et éventuellement cuire à la vapeur) S.V.P.?
Just found you love your enthusiasm and sense of humour. 🥸😊♥️
You funny and your bread looks yummy
Love love love you Jenny.  Great recipes and so easy.  Thank you
Luv your bread resides
Jenny is simply the best👏👏👏❤️❤️❤️❤️
Is there a non gluten version of this?
Made these yesterday and they were great.
I love your energy! Thank you for sharing 🙂
Love how you get straight to the point  Looks nice and easy Can’t wait to make them Thanks
🙏 😊.  I just miss seeing you!  I miss your videos!” You always have such a smile and a kid-at-heart spirit you don’t see too much anymore ♥️
These would make great hamburger buns.
Can we do this in air  fryer
Thank you ms Jenny, I love this vedio ❤️
Hi Jenny! Have you retired from making your cooking videos?
Can you please use grams
Love your enthusiasm and excitement while your making this yummy product.
This is a delightfully scrumptious recipe.
I've watched a few videos on the easiest and quickest bread, and this bread looks by far the best and very easy. I have to give it a try asap
Can you make using rye flour?
😂🤣🤣😂👍👍
Love it. Thank you Jenny.💕💕💕
Can I make them in the toaster oven?
How wonderful and funny you are. It's been a long time coming, finally showing the world your true talents. What a natural! Love, love your recipes. Gonna add sweet ingredients for the sweet tooths in the family. TY
I don't understand what I did wrong on this one. I've made.lots of bread before and I followed the simple ingredients to the letter. However, as soon  as I added the water it was crystal clear the dough was way to dry. Any suggestions?
I just love your recipes. Will try this , thank you.💓
I like your excitement
Is there any difference between mixing dry first or adding flour to water and yeast in bowl already
Why do people say that hot water will kill the yeast ??
Could I substitute yeast for self rising flour?
I love you 😍 the last part was my fav. Such a cutie 😊 I’m about to mold my buns. Oven is heating… Can’t wait to taste it, hopefully I was able to get it right 😅😂😂
😁 I do love your buns 😘 ❤ 😻💜 🥰 🌹🌸🌷 🌾🌿🍀🍁🍂🍃🌼🌻👌👍👏👏
Giving it a go now! Thank yoi
Thanks Jenny. I will try your cake and bread recipes.
Your how to recipes are great
I'm making these.  Thanks
Español por favor c
Cute 😀
Omg I love your videos. Thank you
Jenny, I love how you simplify recipes as much as possible.
I ADORE READING
Omg!!! I’m so happy to see you Jenny. I use to watch your tv talk show all the time. I loved it. So I just watched your rib video so I said let me see what else this lady has so I came across this video and I said omg I know this lady!! This is JennyJones. Hey Jenny!! I just made your ribs my husband loved them. I’m getting ready to make these rolls. Keep doing what your doing
Hey !! You look like Phoebe in FRIENDS 😍
Quedo ¡muy bien! Voy a practicar hacerla, Saludos!!! 👏👏👏❤🥰😋
You are absolutely adorable! I love your enthusiasm and delight when you take the bread out of the oven.  You’re such a little joyful kid!   I am making the bread now…. Hopefully I will share your joy when mine comes out of the oven😄
I love you so practical 💓
Can you use gluten free almond flour?
I would love to see you do a bloomer loaf same method .. or is it?
Could i do this with oat flour?
Does it matter how long they sit on counter before you bake? Mine was almost preheated because I had something in the oven cooking prior to the bread.
The first time I made these I used wheat flour, and they were too dense. The second time I used white bread flour, and they were great - but I live alone, so I couldn't eat them fast enough, had them for 3 days. Tonight I made them again and cut the recipe in half - took a chance - they turned out perfect! 6 little rolls! So cute! I ate 3 of them tonight with soup and I will eat the next 3 tomorrow night. You can make this bread every day because the labor time is so short, it's just making sure you start them early enough for the 3 hour rise. This bread buttered, is better than candy!
You crack me up....a little pun on your buns pun :)  Making these tomorrow when my granddaughter comes for lunch.  Yum...
hi jenny, on your 2 hours recipe, i think it says one hour in the recipe section.  typo error? thank you.  you are so amazing chef.
Lovely thanks i will try this later
I love my buns
She had me at "Are you happy with your buns?" Lol
My wife and I love your tutorials! You make us smile. Thank you.
I just found (and subscribed to) your channel. I adore all the colors! Your kitchen is so bright and colorful which is such a sight for sore eyes in the age of black and white kitchens. Also, you are so bubbly and cheerful. I am looking forward to watching all your videos. Thank you!!
I got to try this, thank you. so happy to see your big smile and you look so cute :)
Ms. Jones, You're such a happy lady!
"Are you happy with your buns?" OMG ! You know how that sounds?
Hello Jenny, when I use 1/4 of table spoon of yeast, they rise much. Would you advise how much more I should add.
Your a treasurer, my wife is jellouse.
I love your sense of humor, thanks
Thank you Jenny. Loved this recepe.
I love your sense of humor ❣️
Hi Jenny, Love you videos. I don't understand why some breads need to be needed and others don't. Made your pizza dough. Turned out great. And I usually like thin crust dough. Hope you are having a great retirment
Thanks, Jenny! New subscriber. I have done the dough, and now waiting another two hours or so, then - forming the rolls! I will let you know. ---> brilliant, they came out exactly as you say, Jenny! Mmmmm ...
Miss Jenny if it takes more then 12 hours is it okay
hey can someone tell me 1 1/4 cups hot tap water is equal to how many in ml pls?
Your the best lol
I been doing her no knead bread for years it always turns out great except u will need more salt
Sorry Jenny, I used all purpose flour and it was a cake not bread
Made these rolls today. Wow! Fantastic! Thank you..thank you .thank you Jenny!
I just figured out who she is, haven’t seen her for years, the fact she’s a cook is even better!!! AWSOME recipes Miss Jones
OH YEAH SHE CAN!! AWESOME!!
I'm going to have to double the recipe for my family, but I'm going to try these.
I might have commented before, but just in case I haven't: I make the bread all the time - it's by far my favorite recipe! Now I'm off to make the rolls. Can't wait! Thanks for sharing your fun videos!
Jenny you explain. It perfectly. Thank you looking forward to making both the rolls and the bread.  Thank you again.
I thought you're not to use hot water with yeast?
Jenny your the best 😘
How to store the tolls overnight ?  Came out very crusty - soft inside.  Great ! Thank you 🙏🏼
Thank you!  Love your good nature -and goofy humor!
I love you, and your dead pan jokes. do you like your buns?
Jenny I just Love you
Thank you so much I made them so good ..❤️❤️❤️🙏🏻
She reminds me of me!  Jokester!
Hi , pretty new to bread baking so pls pardon my ignorance ,,please! two and half cups of flour...with what do u measure it? and water is  one and one fourth cups..how much in ml? your help would help me bake the rolls today. Thank you so much and happy baking y'all!
Thanks Jenny.I love your baking style.Hi from Calgary.
Thanks Jenny ❤️ from Poland
Ps- 450 degree Fahrenheit for 20mins.
Did anyone have a problem with parchment paper burning at 350 degrees? Mine is good up to 320 so I didn't use it so here's hoping....My bread turned out delicious!
You are such a joy to watch. Love your videos. Thank you!
Girl, I have tried and tried to make bread and failed every single time.   I ran across your video and thought, well, it's time to try it again.   I did it!!  They are delicious and my husband is soooo happy.   He is the reason I want to make bread because he loves homemade bread.  Thank you for publishing this video!
Oh my gosh, 8m so happy I found this. I love crispy bread! Will be saving for sure! Thank you.
The little girl enthusiasm is so sweet. And the recipe isn’t bad either !
Jenny you can bring a smile to my face any day xxxx
i like you humor and your bread have a nice day
I just made these today and they came out great!  We ate some of them for lunch and I par-baked some that I then placed in the freezer for an easy heat up.  Thank you!
GREAT& BEAUTIFULL & FAST!!! YES.
You’re doing a great job every time, and you’re so funny. Hi Jenny.
Every time I cover dough with towel the dough gets stuck on the towel.  How do I prevent that?
It’s cold already! ?????
Making these today for Christmas lunch for my family! Merry Christmas, Jenny! ❤️✝️☺️
Watching on December 2021…. Will never get tired of watching these former videos. Absolutely adore you Jenny❣️ exceptional recipes. Thank you.
Are you an actress or something? You look very familiar 🤔
this lady seems died because no video on this channel for last 7 years.
Ahhh Jenny!!! Love your videos and your sense of humor 💖
Just started watching.  Really nice, simple and straightforward demonstration.  Thank you 😊
My dad loves these little rolls. He would stop at a bakery that sold them for like $3 each roll so now I make them for him.
A modern day Julia Child... can't wait to try the recipe...
I think your measurements are way off. I used them and the dough was extremely wet. I had to add lots of flour. Love your excitement!
I love watching this woman. I don't even care if she cooks anything, she's a joy to behold.
😋🤗🥰
Jenny great job 😁 Florida USA 😊 Rainbow 🌈 Chef.
Hello, Hoping somebody can help me. It takes my oven about 45 min to heat up. Is it ok to keep the dough rolls on the counter for that amount time or it has to be 35 minutes? Thanks!
Jenny, I just love your videos. Haven’t made your bread or these rolls, but I’m going to!!! Tc from Nevada
Delicious 😋.  This was part of my breakfast this morning. Thanks for sharing. God bless you.
I GOT IT - HOT WATER FROM THE TAP - AND I FAILED - I WAS USING BOILING WATER OR COOLED DOWN HOT BOILING WATER - THANKS - I WILL TRY AGAIN
I just baked these today. Okay I am a feign, get out of my way with these rolls and Irish Butter. This a go to recipe and giving away for Christmas.
Thank you for sharing this video ❤️👍
Yum-ooooo
You videos are funny
vielen Dank für dieses Video und das Rezept🧡
Jenny, I made this recipe for the first time for our Thanksgiving dinner. I ate one roll and the rest mysteriously disappeared...hubby ate the rest of them!! So as I am typing, I have a double batch rising. Maybe I will get to eat at least two out of this batch???
Hands down my favorite rolls!!
I'm sold! ☺️ A few days before Thanksgiving, First time I've seen your channel and this video! Read the comments. I'm definitely subscribing. Looking forward to making them. Thank you!  ❤️☺️
The teeth at the end was great. It is very nice to see a woman with a sense of humor.
I’m at a loss, suddenly my rolls aren’t getting brown anymore. I tried raising the temperature to 475 and baking them 50 minutes but to no avail. Any suggestions what I’m doing wrong?
Are you saying, a quarter tsp of yeast?   Sounds unbelievable!  Help me someone, I want to make it tonight
Silly!
when i try this my dough in the beginning when i add the initial 1-1/4 hot water does not look like hers, i even had my wife do the measuring for ingredients, but mine looks like it dosnt have enough water in it, how come?
I feel like mine wasn’t wet at all and didn’t bubble after. I wonder what I screwed up.
Does this rise at all please?
Jenny, mine didn’t brown very well. What happened?
Can you add pumpkin purée to this rolls? Thanks
The breads look delicious and I love your silly humor!
Omg. That looks delish.  Thanks
👍
All of her bread recipes are awesome. They don't last long in this house. So yummy 😋 😍 😊 ☺ 💕 🤗
She is so funny! Beautiful roles.  Thank you!  I really like your buns!  They look really appetizing!
Trying this recipe this week😊
When do you put in optional ingredients?  before rising, right?
🤣 This was so entertaining.. especially the ending 😄
I made them today but I felt they needed to be little more cooked , can you let me where I can improve ?thank you so much
You’re awesome, funny and beautiful 😂👍❤️
your sweet!
My Mom made these all the time.  To a tee!! The same recipe to a tee!   I used to help her make them sometimes. They are amazing rolls. Thanks for sharing.  Love your lighthearted video!
Супер, красота
Love bread homemade❤ looks perfect 🥰
Doesn’t hot water kills yeast ?
I love it, she gets so excited
Should I use self rising or all purpose flour?  BTW, Jenny, I have great buns too😉
Baking this rolls now. Another 10mins to wait. It better turn out right. Added flaxseed n egg whites.Cant wait to have a bite Turns out ok crispy but inside not fully done.
Thank you for explaining it so well
Where's Jenny gone? Ain't seen a new upload in years.
Thank you jenny
I made these today and they came out perfect! Thank you Jenny 🙂
Bhaaaahaaaa
I miss you Jenny!! You are awesome!
i  USE  THREE  TABLESPOONS  OF  BROWN  SUGAR  AND  ROLL  THEM  WITH  CLEAN HANDS  DIPPED  IN  WATER- THE  DOUGH  GETS  VERY  MOIST  AND  THEY  COME  OUT  SUPER  CRUSTY
You did not egg wash your buns? Than you...
Really good and easy!   My dough looked like hockey pucks going in the oven and I thought no way are these going to rise much in the 20 minutes it took to bake them.   They rose!  Thanks!
I love how easy this is and also the bread in a Dutch oven too! Your enthusiasm makes me smile!
Lol I love bread to !!! You are so funmy.
Ur awesome
Plz slather butter on them next time. Irish unsalted butter.
Love your videos
These rolls are the best! I can’t say enough about them. She is NOT kidding you. I’ve quit making all the other easy breads I was playing with. 🍞🥖
👌👌👌
You are so special, Jenny!  Your recipes take second place to your charm….thank you for being YOU!
Hi Jenny finally a chance to make these delicious rolls thank you so much !! 💐💐💐💐💐Sooooo simple - only thing is they only last a few minutes ! Kids & neighbors stop in becuse of the smell ! Yum !!
I made this recipe today. They turned out perfectly! I scored the tops with shallow scissor snips to see if they would look like a pro cooked them. I thought that everything about this bread making method seemed all wrong. But it works! The crusty rolls were delicious!
Nice recipe. I liked it a lot. And your sense of humor ... really cool. Greetings from Brazil.
Awesome 👌  great for lunches like your buns 😀
What kind of degrees are you talking about in you recipes, centigrades or Fahrenheit, mostly in the wordl we use decimal system
Thank you so much for sharing your time and recipe with us Jenny. I made this yesterday. The house smelled amazing. Rolls looked great as well. I found them to be a little tough to tear in half and they were somewhat chewy. Other than that the taste was other worldly. Peter from Montreal
Oh dang.  I just commented on the no kneed bread before I watched this. I love crispy crust (Kaiser) rolls.
Can almond or coconut flower be used?
Bardzo dziękuję za świetny przepis i pozdrawiam.
You’re funny Jenny! I love your recipes and I absolutely ADORE your kitchen….my dream kitchen. Keep making these videos. I’ll be watching them all.
I Love You 🕉 You are an Amazing Soul ❣️🦋❣️
where do you get wooden board?
Looks so yummy, going to try this.  Thanks
Making for brunch
Just made them. Superb. Thanks
Your fun. Enjoyed
I love your buns Jenny.
The roll you cut open looked uncooked on the inside and over cooked on the outside.
YOU ARE TOO FUNNY. THX FOR THE GREAT RECIPE.
Jenny I was wondering we like garlic rolls can I add garlic powder to the dry ingredients or will that not work
This was easy to put together with just a few ingredients.  My little twist was to divide the dough in half. One half was placed  in a sealed container and stored in the refrigerator to bake for another day. The other half was divided in two to make larger rolls and baked straight away in the air fryer. I tried other recipes and they never come out right. This one baked crispy and soft inside. 👩‍🍳 thank you👏👏
Oh Jenny,  you are cracking me up!!  Thanks for the smile in these dark days....xoxo
😍
When I Grew Up In The 40's And On, My Mother Made Bread Often, The Old Way! knead And Knead Until Your Blue In The Face! Sorry Mom, But Jenny's Is Better. Easier And Much Faster! My Mom And Dad Came From Italy About 1935. They Did Everything The Like They Were Still in The Old Country. NO REGREATS! I Love My Memory's. (mom & dad turn 105 this year, if they were still living)  they had a long and prosperous life.
Hey Jenny! Tried your rolls they turned out so yummy !  If I want to make a bigger batch can I double your recipe? Thanks!
I am totally in love with Jenny AND her food. I hope she's not married and would love to meet an Australian gentleman who used to be an English gentleman 20 years ago. I can dream can't I :-D
Love your channel Jenny!
I'm going to try this soon! Thank you for sharing! Greetings from California
But Madam   what happens to the yeast does  it not die when using hot water
Love your videos.  I was always intimidated making bread.. I really think I can do it!!!
I think I am in love Jenny :-)
So, the dough can be prepared the night before baking, the next morning? If so, do I need to keep the prepared dough in the fridge? Thank you.
Jenny, you give me hope! I love bread but im so bad at baking. Im going to try this recipe very soon. It looks sooo delicious ^^  Thank you so much for sharing!
I made your bread twice! All my boys LOVE it... I made one to dip in rosemary and garlic butter and one this morning for my 3 (well my hubby couldn't resist either) boys with butter and jam! So so good! I am going to make these next. You are an excellent teacher! Thank you!
It takes 35 minutes for your oven to reach 450 ! Mine takes 10 minutes Am I the only one ? Or is your oven a one of a kind contraption ?
Love sour dough bread.thank you
2 1/2 cups (320 grams) bread flour or all-purpose flour 1/4 teaspoon (1 gram) instant or dry active yeast 1 teaspoon salt 1 1/4 cups hot tap water (up to 130°   ...and some cliff hanging jagged teeth...LOL LOL LOL  nice, so much fun
is she the Jenny that had a talk show way back??
Love you jenny. Thanks. Love frm India
These were absolutely delicious!
Are you married?  No?  Marry me!
Hi , anybody have the written recipe???🙏🏻

Yes yumyum
Great food great humour thankyou
REGARDS
Good morning Gerry 7th and I9I99I7899887777787777of I CAN 8HAVE TO DO IS
Morning Jenny.  I'm so happy that you popped up on my YouTube.  How are you doing? Are you well.  Thank you thank you for these lovely recipes.  And you explain so nicely.  Love from South Africa.
Jenny came across your utubes love the bread recipes, but I know you from somewhere??   QVC or HSN??
I rewatch your stuff over and over and everytime you make me smile...oh heck, I actually laugh out loud. Thank you!
You make my day...🇦🇺😅🤣😂
I love you even laugh at yourself with those teeth 🥰❣️thanks for the recipe, can’t wait to taste them, while waiting for the dough to rise and getting to put them in the oven afterwards 😗 making them for lunch for my family 🤗😉 so easy. Thank you and greetings from the Netherlands ❣️
You should wait 30 min or so to let the breads cool down before touching.
Funny...Jenny i love your instructions with big genuin smile,no boring to watch!Thanks!
Do u sift your flour-
Jenny will you Marry me? Love your Recipes.
I just noticed him! I LOVE that Dominecker rooster in the background!!!
Jenny i am wonder if u could share a low matience sour dough bread starter, from Europe.  They don't have tomkeep adding flour ,  ut do add every month to 6 weeks.
Oh no! These are awful!! They've only been out of the oven fifteen minutes, and I've already eaten three of them!! Lols.   Thank you, I've never made bread before, and besides the two minutes it took to convert the water to an Aussie measurement (300mL, my fellow Aussie bros), this literally took less than five minutes to prep before bed. I used cold water, and left it on the bench until I was done with getting the kids to school and morning walk, etc. I've definitely piled back on what I walked, and I regret nothing. I added a handful of roasted black sesame seeds into the flour before mixing, and it was divine. I love it, not going to be able to do a special meal without them now!!
Jenny u ar a mess😂
I would really like it if you could come up with a tasty doughy keto bread/bun of some type, pretty please with erythritol on top.
Man she can cook, as well with a good sense of humor.
I am going to try making this tomorrow! I enjoy cooking, but haven't made yeast rolls in a very long time. I just have to be careful to not buy yeast at Passover time! (Did that one year, OOPS)
great job
Your an absolute Doll. Thank you Jenny.
WOW—these are the best rolls I have ever had—& so easy to make— I was afraid cause my dough wasn’t sticky like yours but they came out perfect— maybe cause of the high altitude — I live near Denver , Colorado..thanks so much..I’m subscribing to your video..
You are amazing!
Can’t wait to try these——
Thanks for a great and easy recipe made these today and came out amazing now I’ve doubled my ingredients and I’ve got 16 on the go now keep up the great work I think you’re great 👍
Omgooooodness! This woman can make any day into an extraordinary day 😂🌷🌷
"Are you happy with your buns" I fell off my chair😂
Where have you been all my life, and when can we expect some new videos? Hope this comment finds you in good health. Just discovered your channel, and I'm about to binge watch just about all of it.
I just make this and I think going to make more for my mum 😊 thank you 😊
Great video!!!! Loved the ending, too! I just have one question: This method does not require any sort of water in the oven, at the same time, for steam?
Hello. Can I use oven toaster for that buns?
This women is comforting and its not just her buns no pun.im defiantly making these.my mum lives crusty rolls and so do I.
💖Jenny Jones!  You’re fun to watch!!!! 🎊
I love making your recipes! They are easy and delicious!!!!
Jenny, I know it's been 2 years since you made a cooking video but your fans would really appreciate maybe 1 video per month. We miss you!
I enjoyed you so much when you had a talk show, im happy to see you again. Love your cooking instructions ❤ God bless you beautiful Polish girl!!!!
Not enough water had to add more.   Maybe sift my flour next time.
Baliwag
Fantastic rolls first time. Thank you Jenny, you rock!
I love this lady
Hi Jenny I love your buns. I’m 80 and just started doing a little baking. These are simply amazing I look like a star making them and they don’t last long around here and then I make more and it’s fun Thanks William
Love her and her recipes ❤️❤️
Such a pleasure to watch and listen to you...you tick all the boxes...wishing you every success xxx
VERRY GOO.
Love love your channel.  My favourite baking channel on YouTube.  Can you advise if I can freeze the rolls? Thanking you in advance.
I did it Jenny. I did it. I baked it. It was a success. My very first time to make bread.
I love this young lady ....!
I have made these 4 times now! I am addicted! They are SO easy and delicious! Thank you for such a great, easy recipe!
I've been making Jenny's bread and pizza and always turns out awesome!
Thanks 😊
How are you?
I loved this
Does not hot-water kill the yeast ?
So glad I found this video! Me and my roommates are loving this bread. Thanks!
Jenny is seriously one of my favorite people on earth.  She is so geniune - no airs about her AT ALL.  And her recipes are YUM, YUM, YUM!  I am definitely making these rolls as I have been looking for great rolls that have a nice crunch but not too much of one.  And now I have found them!  Thanks Jenny!
She's so lovely we just understand what saying 👍🤗
I have never been a great baker but you cannot go wrong with this or her loaf bread. So easy, so delicious, great texture and it is very gratifying to do this!
Thank you so much, these were super easy and very yummy :
The crumb looks dense
I love you.  I re-look up this regularly all the time.
made crusty rolls today came out fine   just like Jenny said they would , easy       thank you
Darned don’t I love your personality, and your recipes. Thank you, Steve Plymouth, MA
Jenny...you are so lovely..attractive..and all.all..all good.
Hello Jenny, how are you? I hope you are doing well.
Oh my gosh you are the best! I love your great sense of humor and you really are helping me be a better cook. Mahalo!
You are just too lovely and cute,god bless.
I am attempting this recipe for the first time today I mixed the dry ingredients then added the liquid it was very dry so I added another 1/4 cup of water still dry (I used All purpose Whole Wheat Flour)  l did not have any plastic wrap but used a Tupperware bowl with a lid so now waiting to see how it rises in a couple more hours!
Nice beavers JENNY, Your the BEST  Thank you  GOD BLESS
I wish to buy a scraper. Fro you
You’re silly 😛  But your rolls look yuuummyy!
I love you!!  I made these and they turned out great!!!
My oven gets to 500 in 10 minutes
my oven cant get that hot, will 350work?
Made these soooo many times! It’s a “no fail” crusty roll. I’ve made to go with several dishes...lasagna, chicken Alfredo, spaghetti. Tonight it’s chicken parmigiana. You can also reshape into long logs, bake then cut at a diagonal for perfect tomato bruschetta. Just get started on the dough about 1 1/2hr. Bake just before dinner is served.
This recipe is absolutely amazing 👍 I love all your recipes ❤️ I agree Jenn definitely can cook
Super natural and funny woman i liked her bunny teeth lol I wish she's my neighbor I get to learn more from her
ThANKs for sharing the recipe , enjoyed it very much Jenny!!!!
Jenny, please surprise us all with just one new show in 2021!
Beautiful buns,I will make them for my family!thank you Jenny !
I'd like to be able to save this dough in the fridge and get it out to rise on the day I want to bake it - has anyone tried this? did you refrigerate it during the first rise or shape it then refrigerate it?
I love your videos and have made many loves of the no knead bread. I’m trying to add more fiber to my diet and want to know if this recipe will work with whole wheat flour.
Hello from Indonesia... You are so witty and yes can cook 😂👌🇮🇩🥂
Hi, I'm a novice at baking. I've tried this recipe and it worked out pretty well. I'll keep practicing. Just wondering if it makes a difference in the temperature in the kitchen when leaving the dough out for the 3 hrs. e.g. cool winter temp vs hot summer temp?
Thanks for your easy recipe. This is special to me.
Hello madame, will hot water kill the yeast?
Making these now 👍🏻
This recipe worked beautifully so I’m making them again tonight!
jenny is a great cook. i would like to kick the old lady out and move jenny in.
Jenny,   they would not rise properly and the dough looked a lot drier, then yours Jenny. Also in Australia we need 2 level teaspoons to 500gr of flour, so I added 1 level teaspoon of yeast, insteamd of the 1/4  teaspoon. Yeast must be stronger in your country!, Making them right now, will report back.
Thank you so much for this recipe I done it a couple of times now never was disappointed 😍❤
Damn she didn't make a new video in years. Hope she's ok...
Damn I love this woman. She so cracks me up.
this is 2021 and the pandemic isnt over yet.
I just tried your recipe and this turned out bad. The bread was not cooked at all in 20 mins. In 3 hours it does not rise.  I used active dry yeast and clearly it did not work. I have to say that I am very disappointed and now will think twice to try your recipes
Thanks Jenny! Can I double this receipe?
I was watching this 2-3 min before I realized it's JENNY!...Too cool...Great show..
I put 2 and half cups of flour into my bowl and it looks much more than yours Jenny! Your flour looks like it's only 1 and half or max 2 cups. So what is really going on here?
Lol! I love this lady!
Help! You look so good and healthy, I LOVE LOVE LOVE bread, but every body says is gonna make me gain weight 😡
What sort of flour can you use gluten free ?
I made these and they're good, although a bit compact. Am I doing something wrong? I'd like them a wee bit lighter.
Jenny come back !!!! 🥰🥰🥰🙏🙏🙏🌷🌷🌷
I’m so slow. I had no idea this was actually the TV show host, Jenny Jones. I thought she looked just like, Jenny, but I really didnt think it was her. Jenny, I’m really enjoying your cooking videos.
Trying this with the overnight take using cold water, think I got the units wrong though trying to convert to UK units 😟
Jenny I was brought up with bread for every meal. All types. Living in New England, we had every Saturday, Baked Beans, brown bread coleslaw and hot dogs with the best rolls ever...and other days of the week, breads breads breads...Do you have a good recipe for Brown Bread..a Saturday ritual wasnt complete with out that delicious brown bread..so moist and a small amount of raisens in it..delicious
I miss Jenny.
Love the video's, excellent teaching style, plus you crack me up!
I don't think that there's a face on this planet that this wonderful lady couldn't put a smile on😁
Cok sıcak su dökünce ekmek taş  gibi oluyor
WHY IS MY CRUST BECOMING VERY HARD ?
Going to try these today! Jenny, you get more beautiful with each passing year!
Jenny is cooked - but she's cool
Fantastic
Can we use whole wheat flour 2.5 cups
I made these today. They were phenomenal. Thank you so much!
In just tried this recipe and my kids love it! Thank you, Jenny. God bless you. 😊
Jenny.. These turn out even better if you swap out half of your liquid with a light American beer. Also, after rising then reshaping into rolls, sprinkle a little corn flour on all sides with tad of grinder salt, then let them rest in the fridge for a night or two, then take them out 3-4 hours before, and let them rise. Then bake in an enclosed dutch oven, preferably. Let them cool after baking. They will taste like delicious dinner rolls your get at good restaurants. Even letting them sit over night and reheating. Great results.
Just love your passion for bakery and you are so funny
I made these today and boy oh boy are they too yummy! My hubs says they are the best he's had so YES! Thanks for this super easy, no-fail bread recipe. Next up is your tunnel cinnamon bread. You are the best Jenny!
Beautiful!
Could I use whole wheat flour?
Thanks for this beautiful recipe.
OKAY, THESE WERE DELICIOUS WITH THE SESAME SEEDS. YOUZA! ANY OTHER IDEAS TO SHARE FOR "TOPPINGS" OR FLAVORING THESE?
Brilliant Jenny, I love making bread but it’s pot luck wether it turns out ok . Love your so relaxing voice could listen and watch you all day  thanks. Stillington, York, England
I did these today, but used fresh yeast instead! They were perfect!! I was so impressed! Will add some sunflower seeds next time 😍 my first real buns that actually succeeded 🤪
Please , can you tell me how to cook this in an electric oven? Thank you
Wouldn’t  a pan of water in the oven to create steam be helpful here to make the crust even more crisp?
add in some minced meat stuffing in and you have some large dumplings
Jenny is a total breath of fresh air,  got me back into cooking. Simple recipes explained very well and with a wonderful voice ! Thanks you Jenny 😊🇨🇦
Why is it, that when I do the initial mixing of the ingredients, it comes out looking like it needs more water?  This is my second time trying no-knead bread and the last time, the outcome was not good. Very flourie and did not taste good.  Ended up throwing it out. Update:  Just took them out of the oven and surprisingly eatable.  A little heavy, but yet good. Thank you, I will try again.
I can’t believe anyone would give this video a dislike. 🤔 It is a sweet, happy, pretty gal simply teaching how to make some easy delicious homemade rolls.😊❤️👏 Seriously - what is there not to like??? It baffles me who would give this video a thumbs down. 🤔🤷‍♀️
I love you Jenny I am eating it now thank you
I need Recipe for easy Keel bread Ezekiel bread
Could I use Spelt flour?
You’re adorable !!
I love your pie crust that you used for chicken pot pie. I use it for all my pies now. 👍🏻
OMG Jenny you're great!!
Delicious bread rolls, I used a mixture of whole spelt and whole wheat flour and left the dough over night.  It was ready in 15 mins, 450 fan oven.  Next time I won't use baking paper it stuck fast to the rolls!  Thank you.
Jenny, you look marvelous. Love your recipe and love your enthusiasm 🙏❤️
Can this be done in an airfryer? Thanks
You are my all time favorite go-to baking expert.

Hi Jenny,  Can this recipe be doubled? If so, would anything need to be altered?  Thanks
Aah... I guess there's nobody here to ask anymore :  l
Would these rolls be the type that would be good to make for  the egg and cheese and bacon breakfast sandwiches?
Thank u so much
You crack me up! I love your cooking and funny times as well,! Tillie
Curious where you get a board like that?
JENNY YOU ARE AMAZING. LOVE YOUR VIDEO RECEPIES. DO YOU EARN MONEY WITH THIS? YOU COULD HAVE A PERFECT ONLINE COURSE. LOVE FROM CZECH
I have my rolls resting and ready to go in. My dough was soooo very wet. Hope they will be good!!
I’ve made your no-knead bread recipe several times and let me tell you that is one of the best thing I’ve ever tried in my life. It never fails and the results are awesome. However, I mix the ingredients the night before and in a couple of hours or less, I get a wonderful bread for my breakfast. Greetings from Miami and thank you for sharing your knowledge
Jenny your such a beautiful amazing woman
Lovely lady happy with her bakes
Jenny...you are so wonderful...I enjoy your videos.....you are such a joy....keep cooking😇
Next on my list! I love her Dutch oven bread recipe so I already know these will be perfect!
You’re so funny, pretty 😍 I’m enjoying when I’m watching you, I love you ❤️ and thank you 🙏 for recipe, God bless you, I’m gonna try today, I hope it’s gonna come out perfect 👌
Tip, don’t add too much flour on your board while shaping into rolls just wet your hands  this stops the dough sticking to your hands , result Amazing almost sourdough rolls . Plus keep a tiny roll bit back as a starter for your next batch, just keep doing that and you have your own starter forever x
❗👍🙏🌹👌👏
Thank you!! My first time making my own bread!! I wish these were a little bigger.  How much more time would you suggest if I made only 4 or 6 rolls instead of 8?   We like BIG buns for our homemade burgers!
Tried this recipe today. The inside turned out gummy. Is it supposed to be like that?
What a wonderful soul.  Warm greetings from Namibia Jenny.
Followed the recipe,  came out as bread, not crusty,  really dense.  Tasted good with butter.
I love to watch your baking show, I never know what you're going to do next? I have made your wheaten bread and I’m watching your other bread shows until my bread rises. 🇦🇺
Oh, Jenny, you really should provide proper weights rather than very vague “cups of flour”!
My favorite snack from back in my 20's. Dip this awesome bread in very good salad dressing.. best snack ever!
Very easy and helpful....Thank you so much.
All excited going to try
you amazing thanks 😊
REGARDS
1-1/4 cups water is equal to how many ml?  Please advise.  Thank you!
I made this a few times. Cut into 6 not 8 pieces. Also, one time I used Aldi brand flour. Big mistake! It was a loose mess and would not come together in a ball. Use good flour. Hth.
Awesome recipe!   Buns were delish...so exciting to make these buns.   Thanks Jenny!
Jenny, you are a delight to watch. I’m making my first bread today thanks to you.
Very nice recipe chef 👍👌👏. Thank you for your effort 🙏 and A HAPPY NEW YEAR 2021 to you and your family 🎆🎇🎁💖🤗🌹🍾🥂👋
Thank you! Those look actually doable.

Such an easy, quick and yummy full proof recipe. My Family’s new favourite 👍. Thanks for sharing this recipe.
Pass the butter please...
Love them! (Y)
I make artisan bread almost every day but I’ve never done that’s rolls. Got to do it. I love your videos!!!
Hi Jenny happy New year  to you and to all veiwers have a nice day
You are the best ❤️
I live in an RV and the oven is very small. I was thinking about baking these in a toaster oven. Has anyone tried this?
No sugar or honey? Or oil? Hmmm
You are absolutely amazing! Love your channel!
Great recipe and a beautiful sense of humor that we need now. 💖
How come my dough with yeast does not rise.
Jenny what kind of paper is under line you used.? And where can I buy it?TIA
Turned out great! Did a tiny change in the bake, due to the holiday
I know it’s been years since you made this video, but I just have to tell you, Ms. Jenny: I LOVE your enthusiasm  and love for this food.  And your recipes DO work marvellously. Strasznie dziękujemy!
All of your additions for possible substitutions like using AP flour instead of bread flour and types of yeast were extremely helpful with making use of what I had on hand. Excellent rolls. Our roomates make this recipe weekly as well!!
does anyone know if Jenny is still doing videos? I have not seen anything recently? Thank you in advance. Blessings🍃
35 minutes for a modern oven to get to 450?  Did I miss something?
Like seeing her smile.
I substituted a bottle of beer for the water and followed the recipe completely otherwise.  The bread came out perfectly and the taste was terrific.
You are a life saver! I’m making this recipe every week and love it!! I, like you, love bread!! This recipe is delicious and easy!  🎄💕
I'm going to do this today😀😃😃😄😁😆😆😆I can't wait
Omg i am gonna make this heaven food bread tomorrow. THANK YOU 😛💖👌👍
Jenny I love your cooking videos but please stop taking the Lord’s name in vain.
No water in the muffin pan for these?
Love watching you cook your teaching so many people thank you
Yummy! I made no knead yeast bread (for the first time ever) with two versions. My savory version has one teaspoon of Italian seasoning instead of the salt. In my sweet version, I simply added one half cup of dried cranberries.  Wow! Thanks for the easy recipe.
Jenny, thanks to you I found my new passion.. I started baking bread following your recepes.. and my children ❤️ bread 🍞.. I have four grown kids every week I bake about eight loafs of bread for them to take home. It surely puts a big smile on face to know they love my baking. Thanks Jenny ❤️
Liking the pig tails . (Luv from Scotland )
My question is using this recipe can one turn it into a loaf  of bread ?Is whole grain flour  alright to use instead?
not happy with theses buns. after following directions exactly it was a dry mess, no where near sticky. maybe its suppose to be a joke like the silly fake teeth thing at the end..waste of time.
Thank you from a long time fan!  So glad to have found your channel, and I will be trying all the recipes!
Thank you for sharing
Just love these crusty rolls, easy to make and delicious, I'll eat this anytime of day
HELP...when I do the measurements, my mixture is nothing like Jenny’s. It’s dry and crumbled. Should I add water until its sticky like I see? Just learning to bake and welcome pro tips. I love this recipe and want to do it right.
are you happy with your buns no offense 🤣🤣
Are you sure only 2.5 cups flour, it looks you have a lot more flour than 2.5 cups
thank you Jenny
Your cute and colorful!!  Can't it to make some tomorroww!
The best crunchy rolls!  Family loves!  Luv ya Jenny :-)
Dear Jenny, We love your buns! I couldn’t believe how easy and delicious they were. Made the dough in the morning and baked them for dinner. They have the perfect amount of crunch and softness. Thanks so much for all of your great recipes. Hope you’re well during these difficult times. All the best to you.
Used wheat flour dry dough so had to add water we will see how it turns out......done mine stuck to paper
Thanks for share. I did yesterday. Omg sooo good.  👍👍👍
I love Jenny, always smiling 😍
Made this rolls (doubled the recipe to share w/a couple of neighbors) and were so easy to make and so delicious!!! Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!!!
I love everything about this.
Lol love your smile at the end! You look amazing and beautiful!
i like jenny
I actually made hamburger rolls from this recipe. A foot of snow motivated me.
The best breads and easy to make better taste than sourdough.
Wasn't expecting that ending ! 🤣 really funny and I will definitely try this recipe and hopefully have teeth just like yours 😂 Great tutorial 👏👍
A joy to watch your vids.🥰👍👏👏👏👏👏
just tried these.  they came out ok.  2 things: i would go a little under the flour maybe use 2 1/4 cups because you have to add flour to form them.  Actually mine did not need much extra flour at end.  Also,  when she she said to make drawstring that led me to be they should be higher a more like a ball.  I would divide up in 2 more rolls.  Mine came out a little doughy, but the crust was amazing.
LOL
Love ur recipes Jenny! How many days these rolls can last in the fridge?
I live your  every bread Rolls and whole wheat stuff
Jenny, your like the neighbor people wish they has. I love watching your cooking videos.  Your like our own family teaching us a recipe. I will absolutely try this recipe because, like yourself, I love bread too. My dad used to say you can ruin a sandwich, if the bread isn't good. Thank you and keep making videos.
I wonder if I could make these ahead ... like today for thanksgiving tomorrow.  I shall try it!
Yes an "ancient" video but sure love your pony tails. [11/2020]
Stupid question: Using stand mixer with this recipe is okay right? 😂
How would I make this using sourdough starter?
I love ur recipes and have made allot of them   your so funny I'm going to try the rolls
You are wonderful and I enjoy all your social media communications on cooking and baking all sorts of foods.  You are entertaining and I appreciate you!  Thank you Jenny!
You’re too cute Jenny! 🥰
I can’t stop watching these vids! Good to see you again Jenny!
Couldn't you paint butter on them instead of egg?.
Jenny got a new subscriber lol.
@5:56 dude do you say this on every bread baking video you make? I don't know how you find breads to be "like sourdough" from looking at it, especially since it's got nothing to do with structure or crumb, and the aroma from a yeast bread is very different from sourdough...
I’ve made the hard rolls a few times.   I am having trouble with the rolls sticking to the parchment t paper when done. I have to end up scraping paper off the bottoms.    Thoughts????
Jenny, my goodness!!! U were my fav on tv talk yes Jenny Jones-----I totally love your recipes. I'm Canadian was born in Hamilton., spent many summers in Stratford in the 60's----was a happening place with Shakespearean Theatre
You are a source of inspiration Jenny. Love your bread !
Yes, in U.K, November 20. Making these this  morning. Just found you Jenny, love your channel. ❤️🇬🇧
Wow...i really learned a lot from u.
love your video your hilarious loved the teeth bit so funny
Great recipe. If i have to work hard on it. Then, i no knead bread.
A Billy-Bob girl with nice buns. A true Southern Belle!
very great recipe! I just made them and they turned out delicious. NOTE: I baked mine for 18 minutes at 450 and the bottoms were a bit black
Hi. Just trying these. It’s taken me ages to find bread flour. I got brown bread flour but my dough is very stiff. Any suggestions. x
Jenny just cracks me up......AND....she can cook! Made her no knead bread and everyone LOVES IT! Thank you Jenny.  BTW....went to your show many moons ago.
Can you replace the regular flour with almond flour? If so how do you make the change? Lo carb!!!
Could I double this recipe? Love them . Thank you 👍
Hi from Ireland I love your bread so l will for sure be making these
How do you think this would come out gf?
I agree: "Jenny can cook"
Those Rolls are Hot Just like You Jenny
Omg these rolls are amazing!
ummmmm. I´m going to try it right now. Thaks for share, Jenny
Love your recipes Jenny, the only comment I have is the use of 'hot water from the hot tap,' you may not know it but this water usually comes from the immersion or central heated system tank, which is commonly fed from a water storage tank in the loft, this water will have been sitting in the tank for a long time and will be very stale, and unless you have it 'fully sealed' will certainly have a lot of dead insects, flies and spiders assorted in it.....I have seen the odd drowned mouse to boot. Best to use fresh water from the cold tap and heat it up. I'll cover my point by adding that in modern buildings were no storage tanks are fitted, the hot tap water will be off the main supply and therefore fresh. Sorry to nite pick but the health of your followers is important. Keep up the great work, your enthusiasm is contagious.
What a beautiful fantastic baker   chef 👩‍🍳Thank you
I have to make these! I would be happy everyday if all I ate was bread! Love it!
You. Are so lovely
I made them, horrible, horrible bread, you take them out of the oven, you put the butter on them and they are gone in minutes, just horrible.
I love bread! I 🥰
Goofball, but very cute goofball!
Really enjoy your video’s!  Thank you
Great video, thank you, with this covid time, I can’t stop baking, try this tomorrow
My dough came out very loose and runny after 3 hours? Any tips for understanding why this happened? Thank you!
Sweet lady😆
I make bread in my house and love doing it, and love kneading. I thought I would have a go at this recipe by Jenny. I followed the instructions to the tee, with the same ingredients but the rolls were so chewy my wife made bread pudding out of them. Any ideas why they were chewy?.
You got nice Buns (Bulka)!
Jenny, you seem like such a nice, fun person! Gonna try this - I make Challah every week. By the way, my first cousin, David Gleicher, was on your show many years ago, he was a lawyer from Chicago who helped someone be found innocent through DNA evidence - something new I believe in the ‘90s. Don’t know if you remember. He lives in Israel now.
I am trying these for the first time today. Have not baked bread for at least 30 years - and that loaf turned out like a cement block. Waiting the 3 hours now to let it rise while being hopeful that they will turn out like yours:)  Will let you know how they turn out.
Hi Jenny, I usually look for measures in weight as against cups. This  recipe would be around 100% hydration if I weigh the water. Would that not be too much water?
Did you use the full yeast packet? Ty
What the heck ?!  Jenny is GREAT !  I’m shocked and sad at all the thumbs down.
OMG, I just made the rolls and there awesome! The crunch is just perfectToo. Thank you JJ 😍😍😍😍
I have tried this recipe and the buns came out really good😊
♥
I am not successful any of the no knead bread tutorial and I don't know what is wrong. I follow all the measurement and procedure. The bread do not rise
Such an easy recipe! Children could get the hang of it.
Kako finobprobat ce mo napravit bravo
2020 -10 -12:  Greetings to Jenny and all the people who have commented below. I agree that this is such a lovely baking site. I'm kindly asking for ideas regards easy bread and roll making without using  [wheat flour] as both my wife and I are not supposed to eat wheat bread or rolls, but we do love bread, rolls and panini's including toasted sandwiches I would love to try making them using other flour like oats / corn flour / coconut  / rice  / sago / cassava etc but have no idea where to start. My few previous attempts have found the 'bread' flavour is not there - absolutely bland - horrible. We do believe there must be some healthy flours available to get around this problem I thank you in anticipation, Regards.
Will they make good hamburger buns?
Love these videos. Easy to follow. I check out others but always come back to you!!!
Thank you for the recipe ! 💕 I made the rolls for the first time and they were sooo delicious and beautiful! Love you !
Do i not need to proof active dry yeast in advance?
As someone who has been doing this for a little but obviously not an expert, I thoroughly enjoyed this. From the methods to you sometimes explaining why a step is done (Such as temperatures and times) I have always found were the most helpful when I was learning. And I am using a modified version of this recipe to make hamburger buns. Although my inoculation will be of sourdough starter and slightly higher and I am using a bread, whole wheat, spelt and hand ground rosemary as the dry ingredients.  Perhaps added a touch of oil and adjusted your base times accordingly.  Either way. I came here. I watched and your video provided me with a good solid base for these perfect buns for the perfect burger.  I cook a lot, but no where near a professional and only ever really bake whole loaves. Thanks again. You keep being you, Jenny. You're awesome.
Good for single 👍 men
When I mixed the ingredients the mixture was rather dry. I used the same measurements?????
I love your vibe..i was a bit low today but your video put a big smile on my face. Thank you ❤
I made the no knead bread in a Dutch oven.  Turned out great. Next, I will try this roll recipe. I love rolls and bread!!! Thank you Jenny!!!
Hey Jenny your expressions are just great and persuading...
I love you lady
Thank You!! You are a wonderful presenter!!
She's so cute
Hello Jenny Can Cook...  I watched your show when it was on TV and enjoyed all the tips and cheerful attitude you brought to that show...  I am pleased to have found your tips still being given out to more people...  I just wish some of your shows could be re-broadcast thru youtube....
Can not have salt, can we use 1/4 tsp salt?   Will make it after your answer. Thanks
Can you use while wheat flour?
You too funny Jenny and you can cook 😁🤩🥰🙏
I Love Jenny!  These are the best crusty rolls, make them quite often
I section this dough into quarters for sandwich rolls. Absolute perfection!  Especially with the egg white/sesame seeds.
jenny, Hate to add a downer, but i made these rolls exactly as shown and I had to add more than a cup of extra flour after the first rise and still could not get the effect that the video shows. Now, maybe the video was fast forward to make it look like it was fast to do. I used all purpose flour. Why was my flour after the first rise still sticky even after adding extra flour to it? I waited just over 3 hours for the rise.
Where are you?
I love this recipe!  Sooo easy and sooo good! THANK YOU Jennie!!
This bread is amazing ! The rolls have only been out of the oven an hour, and I've already eaten three :)  Some of the nicest bread I've ever eaten...the textures and flavour are irresistible. Thank you so much !
👏🏆❤️
my second video I have watched of yours and I maybe getting carried away and just watching it for the laughs..who knows..I'm liking your videos so far..
Bismillah...saya dari Indonesia  Terima kasih resep roti2nya yg enak dan mudah membuatnya 😘
She is a professional stand up comedian after all!!
😂😂😋😋
The dough is dry and I have done it twice using exact measurements of King Arthur bread flour. Anyone else experience this problem?
Wow! I have to try this today
❓… Can we make a mixture with whole wheat for these rolls and for the loaf...❓ thank you Jenny 🙏
I absolutely love Jenny! I’ve made this many times and have passed this recipe down to many of my friends. They think I’m a genius. Who am I to correct them?! 😃🥖🥖🥖🥖🥖
her hair looks so cute
September 2020 anyone??
Merci Jenny!❤️👍🏻 From 🇨🇦
Can these be made with whole wheat flour? Would the process be the same?
Add the butter to soften the bite 😋
BUNS AAAAAAAAAAAAH BUNS LOVE EM...
I love the bright colors in that kitchen. I might need to try these buns.
Bravo I'm must trying tomorrow
We miss you….. wish you would come back....
This bread looks amazing . had any body try to make a gluten free version of it? l
when is someone going to come up with the bread you bake in the microwave?
Looks good n crusty for the dough not to stick to your fingers I think the fingers should be dipped in little water btw can the bread be left in the oven for about 15 mins so that it becomes more crispy
Hot water from the tap is not clean water . . . Mistake!
Thank you so much for every video you’ve ever made.  I want to make the crusty rolls tomorrow.  Please, please tell me where did you ever find the timers you have?  So far I’ve seen you use the ducky and I think the piggy..  Super cute!
The cups, is this american cups I need to convert to ounces or grams for the uk
I add a good teaspoon of olive oil as it makes the dough puffier.
Bernice
For this and for the big loaf, adding TJ's Everything Bagel seasoning into the mix and/or as a topping is awesome!
She is so funny.  Love it!
My first batch came out perfect, thank you.  This was my first time ever making rolls and it was so easy.
I vividly remember watching your show on TV back in the '80's! You haven't changed a bit! I was so happy to find you on YouTube with a cooking channel! These rolls are everything you said. I've never had better rolls in my 63 years. They are so easy to make and beyond delicious! Thank you for your smile and your culinary expertise! Best of luck with all of your endeavors. Bread has always been a go-to for me. You've made my retirement days so happy!
Can I use oiled fingers to keep the dough from sticking, or will it get to soft? Thank you for cheering me on and up!
I thought hot water killed the yeast!? 🤔
Love you Jenny..I make this recipe and add raisins, cinnamon, walnuts and 2 tables of brown sugar.. It’s awesome. I even make a version with olives. 🥰
Love the NO KNEEDING....
I will try them they look the best and the recipe is almost the same like the bread!
Oh Jenny. Your crusty buns are excellent!
hello guys, i like to know why there is 1.7k dislike? can you guys who dislike comment why?
Thank you Jenny for sharing your no knead rolls recipe.😁😷👍
i've tried a few different recipes and this is absolutely the only one for me. thank you jenny, you sure can cook. so can we now.
Thanks for  the recipe , it’s so amazing and taste wonderful!👍🏼
Will try these as we are in Lockdown for 6 weeks 😭 13th August 2020 AUSTRALIA
I turned your no knead bread into raisin  cinnamon bread, and Mediterranean olive bread as well as regular white loaves.  Now I'm going to try the sandwich rolls!!!
Thank you for coming back and doing something sensible to not just teach me but my children and it doesn’t involve politics or personal views except for who you are and how you cook or bake and how to teach us very simple basic methods. I’m a trained chef I’ve been cooking for over 30 years and you’re brilliant. Like Julia Childs. Simplicity at its best. Thank you God bless.
You are so weird....I love you!
You are hilarious 😍 Love your straight faced humour.
Funny girl.
Please do not use plastic, replace it with something else biodegradable
Can I use  Millet or whole wheat flour instead of white flour will the bread come out the same. Please let me know . Thank u.
Jenny can cook lol your comedy is getting me thru iso 8/2020
Made the bread its wonderful and Jenny you explained it so well.Ill make this again.Using them like mini breads for sandwiches and ill make fresh pesto to go with the bread.
Why do you say "pre-heat the oven "when you are really just heating the oven?...Heat it before you heat it i suppose...
Jenny Jones show!
Can’t believe I haven’t seen this before today.  I’ve done the no-kneed Dutch oven bread and I can’t wait to do the rolls.
I'm going to try them tomorrow...I'll let you know how they came....yummy
Yummy!! Your recipes are the best. Thankyou
Love this woman!
i tried these but they did not seem to rise enough.  the inside was very dense and the outside really hard,  maybe i will try the overnight method
My sister put a loaf of bread in the oven just as I started watching. I didn't realize it because I'm upstairs, but then  I'm like, what's that I smell, it's familiar...pleasant.  Lol😁🤭😝😂
Will try these tomorrow ms Jenny
When r u gonna do more videos jen?
Thank you I like your recipe❤️💐
You are so sweet and so pretty, love you💕, love your breads.
I love her buns...and the rolls looked good too
Jenny, you are so fun to watch..... You put a smile on MY face!! thank you!!
ohhh i'm happy with your buns too..... and mine...... and others..... I love buns.
i love bread but realized it is the trigger for eczema skin problem
She is really great. I like to cook and bake if I want something new I always go to her website .She is the kind of woman every men dream to have one., including me.
Your chocolate cake is the best and so quick and easy. I thank my friend thank you. We love it.
Do you think these would make a good hamburger bun?  I hate store bought buns. I was just wondering if they may be a little too crispy to bite through for a hamburger. They look so delicious. 😋 P.S. I just stumbled upon your recipes today, I had no idea?  I used to watch your talk show, loved you then and even more now!  You are so funny in a subtle way.  I am going through all I can find today because I am getting a little chuckle from each and every one...best Sunday ever! ❤
This is the first bread that I've made and it's a success. So happy. Thank you Jenny!
Love the way you teach and cook.  Wonderful video. The finish was perfect. Thank you
Hey Jenny, I dont find the No Knead and No Oven Ducth bread recipe you mentioned here. I made a quick search on you channel with no results. can you tell me where to find it?
Thirty five minutes for your oven to heat up?  That's ridiculous.
Jenny why does my crusty rolls have a chewy bottom?Worried
But how do you turn out ciabatta rolls?
Hello dear :) Id like to try your recipe... but before I do... just wondering ... is 1/4 teaspoon really only a 1 gram of instant yeast??????? In my experience, it is more... Best regards and all best wishes to all of you:)
Went from 8 to 16 to 8 ??
You're so awesome!!
I’m finally doing this!  So looking forward to the final result, but my dough looks so much dryer than yours!  I double checked and measured correctly... It’s sitting for 3 hrs now.  We’ll see what happens
Your kids are lucky to have a cool and funny mom! 😂 I am a fan. I'm gonna try this recipe... Looks yummy!
Can I use whole wheat flour?
Looks very easy will def try ut
U r so bubbly and sweet laughing is the best medicine in these pandemic times stay blessed Roshan Shroff
I wish she would do more recipe videos. She has such a bright and sparkling personality.
I made these just now!  I made your "Faster No Knead Bread" earlier today.  Amazing and SO EASY!  Thanks!  You're a life saver.  I was buying the same bread (I'm sure) at the store for $5-$8 a loaf.  What a crime.  I won't have to do that again!  This is TOO EASY not to do!  THANK YOU!!! <3
Can you make this with whole wheat flour
Very nice Jenny! And what a beautiful smile! 🤗
I ended up adding one more cup of water. One and a quarter wasn’t enough at all. Other than that great recipe!
Since we live 1800 miles from our Buffalo, NY hometown, we are unable to get Kimmelwick rolls to make beef on wick from our leftover pot roast. So as a rainy day project, my husband and I made these adding caraway seeds and kosher salt to the top.  Yum!  They turned out so well that we immediately started another batch but this time with sesame seeds on top.  Thank you for the video and recipe!
Hi, can I substitute all purpose flour with wholewheat flour? Tx
I wish you would make more videos, you are so funny & sweet,
Thank you Jenny! Made it twice now and it’s soooooo delicious! 😘👍😋
So Walmart now has yeast, baking powder, and some mixes. Ii get mine from Amazon; even then, waited 2-3 weeks for it. I miss the cornbread mix that you can doctor to make corn cake pancakes, which I love. I will try to make them using a regular cornbread recipe. This no-knead bread recipe is good. Bread is essential. Glad so many are re-discovering the 💕 of baking.
Love you Jenny!!
Good kook looks like the same recipe like your bread.
Love your recipes..so simple and easy.. thanks
I love crusty rolls. Never knew that it's so easy to make.  When the rolls came out from the oven they smelt and look so good. The only problem I have is that when eaten the roll is a bit chewy (like elastic). Can you please tell me how I can rectify that? Can I add some milk to it?
They are fabulous.  So easy to make  Thank you. Jenny ❤️😘
OMG! It looks so easy, I can't wait to try it.
I made this and this the the best rolls I’ve made I love them thank you jenny
Its nice.  Is  it  make harm to body to use yeast frequently ? Let me know.Thanks
i love the colours everywhere!  You look amazing!  Thank you for sharing!!!
It doesnt turn up to be quite as crusty as the dutch oven baked bread recipe that uve also done on your other video
Can you make the dough the next day
Congratulations!!!!! The bread looks delicious!
Jenny, I followed your recipe for bread and have made the rolls many times. Thank you for the good instructions.  You are a great teacher.  The only thing is that I did the yeast in 1/2 cup warm water with 1 teaspoon of yeast and 2 teaspoon of sugar. Then add it to the flour and knead. 🙏🏽💐😋
Just become a huge fan having seen your bread version earlier this morning!! Love this recipe too!
This lady is marvellous, because of her I started baking?!  Everything turned out great my family loved it, thanks for sharing 😷☘️☘️
B
3 HOURS! Ayayay... ok. Gotta wait and see now.  Will be putting this dough in the oven in a 2 hours, I'll tell you if it still works. Why 3?
Love your buns... hate the joke denture.
I have tried many bread recipes and this has been the most awesome,  easiest and authentic tasting! I let my mix soak overnight and it was so yummy! Highly recommend trying this!
Can this recipe be made in a loaf pan ?
Your so cute!! Thank you for the super easy recipe, I’m going to make today
Mine came hard,what is the reason?
I followed this recipe exactly as you said and it came out so gooood! My family loved it. I added cheese like Terry suggested
Jenny is helping us cook too!  Easy recipes and very little work involved to get yummy breads. Tx, Jenny
First time I watch your videos and love you already. Subscribed. Quarantine hugs from Vero Beach, Fl. Be safe.
You're funny. Can't wait to make them
love your instructional videos...BUT....how the heck do you get that plastic wrap to come out the first time and in a perfect piece???? I fight that plastic wrap every time!   :)
Wow...can’t wait to try these...thank you soooooo much
It’s so good MIL who is “allergic to gluten” would eat this. 😂 Has anyone tried doubling the recipe? Can I make them in one batch?
Awesome. Your the best.
From Venezuela... I love you... you are so charming...
Very easy to make and delicious! How can I make the rolls softer? They were too hard for our teeth. Sprinkle some water maybe?
Would you please aproximate the quantity of water in ml or grams?
Excellent video! I just doubt my ability! I guess you keep trying and improve from experience! Onward and upwards hey!
Love to watch Jenny cook!
I will definitely try it...so easy recipe exactly for me 😁 and they look crispy and delicious...thank you for great recipe. And I like your positive  personality
made these rolls - Awesome recipe  - Reminds me of the crusty rolls we used to get back home
Such a sweet lady and so exciting to see you bake! Thank you. Will bake this!
Aardappel snack met mozarrlla
Thank you for this! I find your excited tone very soothing somehow!
If I want them hot for dinner how long can they rest before baking?
I have a Wolf convection oven. Do you have the proper conversion?
Aww. I just discovered you. And I just love watching your baking. So great for me. As I'm not a baker. No matter how hard I tried. And I especially love the sense of humor and fun you add on to it. Instead of all seriousness. Keep up the good work. Love it.
Why do you need to cover them while you preheat the oven?
Thank you for this recipe. I made them for supper tonight to go with ratatouille that I made. Your recipe was really easy to follow & results were very good. 💕
Ok first time baking bread, first time trying a no knead one for that matter! The rolls turned out great! They look out of a restaurant and the flavor is delicious! I followed your guidance, and got crazy good results! Thank you so much, loving it! I think I will be baking at least a thousand batches before getting bored of this! :)
I brush tops with olive oil and sprinkle Italian seasonings on top then bake. They actually taste like Portuguese rolls. Very good and so easy.
I watched the video and my dough was not loose.  Then I did a search and there was your recipe and need to aerate the flour before measuring.  Too late, it's already in the resting process.  Hope it's not too much of a disaster.  Wish you would have said that in the video.  :(
❤❤❤Jenny, thank you for making this video, l am no baker, but you are giving me hope maybe l can do it. You're so fun, thank you for the tips you give, your sunshine spirit, l love it, l love you ❤❤❤
you are an american treasure !
Super easy and taste so good. It’s chewy and good crust!
Can u use almond flour?
Jenny, where did you learn to cook like this? You seem very happy!  :-)
You look lovely in yellow
I love bread also and saw these i will make them for Memorial day for my hamburgers omg they look great ,,,Ps thank you for letting me know about rolling pin
I'm wondering, what's the best way to store these rolls if you don't eat all of them the first day? This is my first time ever baking bread. I used this recipe after another so-called easy recipe was a total fail! (Had to throw the whole thing out.) The rolls were delicious, with a crisp crust. Even a lot of the baguettes I buy at local bakeries don't get the crust right. So thanks! My only challenge was with the dough. Guess I needed to use more flour, because it was hugely moist and sticky. But even so, the rolls turned out great.
Just a note from a long, long time bread baker - you should not cut into the bread until it's completely cool. The crumb doesn't fully develop until that time.
Thank you Jenny for sharing this wonderful dinner rolls recipe. Love it .
Can I freeze the dough if I don't need so many buns?
Jenny has saved my family during quarantine! My mother adores this recipe.
I grew up watching ur talk show now I get to watch ur cooking channel I'm so glad I found d this channel u r hilarious too
These turned out wonderful. Big thank-you from Hungary for sharing the recipe.
I’ve made these buns a couple times now. A great simple recipe.  Made a pot of chilli this evening and instead of making them into buns, I shaped into a baguette. Had to cook a bit longer but turned out great!
Watching this while in CV-19 Social Distancing/Pandemic, April 2020.  Thanks Jenny. I remember watching your talk show with my Mom, RIP. Thanks for keeping it simple. I am making it tomorrow!
Hi Jenny.. you are the perfect partner.. what fun you are... who's your lucky man... well done sir.
Hi Jenny I tried your recipe and the buns came out great thank you
When I made this following Jenny's recipe - I added the hot water as per ingredient list, but my dough was nowhere near as wet as Jenny's.  I had to add almost 3/4 cup of hot water to reach the same consistency.  I know I had right amount of bread flour, so I zoomed in on Jenny's video and it looks like she's added more than 1 1/4 cups of water.   My dough is resting right now...s o I'll let you know how it turns out.  Just wondering if anyone else experienced this problem, please?
I'm a big fan of your no-knead bread. Why can't you make these with the same amount of yeast (2 teaspoons) and only do a 1 hour rise? Then just make the rolls.
great recipes and you are precious
Jenny’s recipes are THE BEST!!!  Made this and was amazed. Delicious 😋
This is incredible. So few ingredients and easy to follow instruction and the result is awesome.
Wholemeal bread cakes
Hi Jenny Nice video, i believe i did some work for you it was in house painting years ago. I hope all is good with you.
Can you make this KETO?
Just made these and they came out so good 😊 try making them, it’s so easy!
I made these!  They are SOOOOO easy!  Mine spread out a little more than maybe they should, and didn’t rise quite as high.  I might not have used enough flour.  But, what I wound up with were PERFECT English muffins!  Complete with nooks and crannies.  They were so great toasted.  I hope I can do it that way again.
Thank you Jenny for the lovely recipes!♥️ Always fail proof and excellent 👏👏👏👏👏
Can I use gluten free flour?
Hey I love this, I made it with regular flour and was a great hit and tried it twice with spelt and wasn’t so great ,any tips on what I can improve ?
I cannot get them to go brownish on top??
Made these and they came out amazing!
Jenny awesome recepie love the energy in the video  :)
Can I use baking powder instead yeast?? Good to see you again Jenny
I do love my buns lol
I don’t have the pot can I used baking sheet
You are such a crack up lol x
May 4th 2020, day 96 in self isolation, been out about 6 times total... and I'm making these rolls to-flippin-day - not something I thought I'd ever do, bake bread. I actually got as excited as Jenny when she cut that finished roll open. Envisioned a butter pat placed in the middle and the roll closed back for a few secs. Mouth watering. Thanks Jen!
My family absolutely loved these with my beef stroganoff!
Can you add a little sugar?
They turned out great. Everyone loves these! Thanks Jenny!
It's a shame Jenny Jones lost her talkshow... I love ya Jenny! Thanks for showing us your recipes
ok...answered my own question...you have parchment on cookie sheet
DO you bake on the parchment paper placed on the oven rack. Not quite sure what that step was.
absolutely love them , you're the best cook ever
You Are Such A Great Soul 🙏🏼🙏🏼 brought smile to my face
Just made these; the two l am about to finish were absolutely great! Thank you very much for sharing the recipe!
And sorry one more question:  can you clarify for me (once and for all) I can only find active dry yeast for now. There’re many recipes that I want to try but they use instant yeast. And if you use active dry you have to proof it first. But in this video you said both kinds of yeast work just fine, and if I use active dry yeast do I do the same thing like you did...just add it straight into the flour then add water? How come I don’t have to proof the active dry yeast and add it straight into my bread machine? Thank you I’m very new to bread making and have all these stupid questions
You’re so funny Jenny! But I’m confused.... I thought hot water would kill yeast but you added hot water here?!
Jenny Jones rolls
Thanks😍👍
love watching your videos... and great recipes
Everybody say preheat your oven and how hot your oven must be but on what setting must you put your oven? Mine have like 9 different signs on my oven settings!!
May 2020, Cape Town and housebound... Just made these. Man, I feel SICK from gluttony!!! Soooooo good. 🐷🐷🐷
Do you incorporate sugar to dry ingredients to feed the yeast?
Its May and we still in quarantine.   Good to bake yummy buns. Thanks heaps for sharing.   Melbourne also hitting wintertime, so weather is perfect too
How can you not just love her??????????????
Will be trying this soon.  Love your cooking style Jenny
Thank you for sharing amazing buns!
You are not the same Jenny I remember. I like this Jenny better!
Can you make this with whole wheat flour
I love your video's Jenny!
Jenny...can I use Whole Wheat flour? and if using whole wheat, do all other ingredients stay the same? I made the original receipe and they WERE DELICIOUS!!!!  My very first time making homemade bread, I was so excited and they were DELICIOUS!!
JENNY🌹 I Just Love 🖤 your channel 👏 👍 👌 And you're sense of humor😉🤭😂👀 Every single one of your recipes I have tried have come out perfect and delicious 😋 👌👏👍😍 I am your new #1 fan 💯%😘👀✌️
Great presentation! Your enthusiasm has made me make these tonight! Thank you for the wonderful tutorial.
Are you happy with your buns?!!! Omg this lady has me rollin!! Sorry, had to. Love this lady.
Love yr recipes o breads hope u make many more !❤️
Not enough yeast. Should be at least one teaspoon. Dough would not rise.
MY oven takes 5  min to get to 450    Electric
Love the simplicity of Jenny's recipes.  I made these rolls yesterday and they were awesome.  Easy to make and are even better than what you buy in the store.  At least I know what the ingredients truly are.
My tap water is around 75˚C, would kill the yeast for sure... ☺️
can't find any flour!!
I’m making these tomorrow with my granddaughter, we’re in lock down. I can’t wait yum thanks 😋
Best rolls and super easy to make. Easy to follow and came out exactly like the video. Jenny, I too am a bread lover and could relate to your excitement! Thank you!!!
She is so fabulous.  Like a ray of sunshine on a cloudy, rainy day.  I wish she were my neighbor.  Thank you for posting!!!
Tried these today. Success!!!! Very easy and delicious.
you are so easy to follow and soooo sweet Thank you
Can you double the recipe to make 16 rolls or is it easier to just make two doughs?
Hi Jenny! Planning to make your dinner rolls recipe on your website and it says to beat. Does that mean with the dough attachment or electric whisk? Thanks! Going to be making crusty rolls later this week !
I get my instant yeast from a packet which has 10g but this recipe is 1g. What should I do with the rest of the packet? Is it still okay to use if I put it in a container?
Reminds me of my mom cooking from the Betty Crocker Cook Book. Simplicity.
This lady is so cute!
Cute presentation!  So this looks very interesting and i will try it out!🤗
I just made it and wow!! that's good bread!!
My granddaughter and I have made the bread a few times and loved the results...delicious!!  Now we will have to try the rolls.
Idk Jenny , my buns aren't as tight as I'd like.. 🤣.  Love that blouse and hair.. you look adorable.
This recipe calls for 1/4 tsp of yeast. Google says you can refrigerate leftover yeast in an airtight container for up to 4 months
2.5 cups of flour..... pffff... ever heard of grams?
Silly question but is this Celcius or Farenheit??? Asking for a friend..lol
Can we please acknowledge how easily she pulled that plastic wrap like a Pro? Whenever I do it it gets stuck always lol
Needs more salt
O man I did did 6 instead of eight wasnot cooked inside
Hi Jenny... live your channel! I have been making the rolls and follow the receipt to the letter... my rolls do come out good but they do not look like yours.... any thoughts! Please!
I made it from durum flour! It's perfect recipe! Thanks!
They were perfect and crips😍 loved the recipe...Soo simple 😍
Just baked this rolls and their simply easy to make and delicious especially with butter. Quarantine Skills! haha April 2020
She makes it sound like baking the bread is so exciting! thanks for sharing.  I'm going to try making one today :D oh covid quarantine days.  I'm starting to get really atuned to having so much time to try new things.
Waooo so easy, and they look delicious, thank you Jenny. I will make bread for the first time.
Superb ‼️🙋 Wish I had yeast ,would rush to make it Tx
This is easy and fun. Thanks for not adding music. Much appreciated!
You're so beautiful and such a joy to watch!
This was the easiest recipe and turned out perfect. Thanks Jenny!
Too funny....love the bread.
Awesome, thank you!
Some today April 27, 2020 😋
I'm on my 3rd time trying I am not a good baker lol Hopefully this time works.  Stay sweet all
It's so easy and so good too! I've made them twice and they turned out great.
Made these last night....So GOOD!.  Thanks jenny
Thank you for sharing bambina. You are very god!
Jenny I made these yesterday and they were fabulous and so easy THANKS a million for these ,especially in lockdown as we are now.  Bless you love xx
SHE’S FUNNY!
Quick question/note: 2 and 1/2 cups of flour takes me to 500g and not 320. Not sure how much 1 cup measures for you though? When I mixed the dough with 320g flour it was basically liquid, so I actually measured 2 and 1/2 cups of flour and increased the flour content to 500g and now the dough looks more like in the video. I will let it rest for 3 hours and let you know how they turn out
Thank you Jenny! YOu are a life saver during this Covid-19. Enjoying all your recipes and especially the practical bread recipes. Thank you!
Careful when you add hot water, make sure you follow the directions that are particular to the type of yeast that you have purchased...  the water temperature for the one i use needs to be 100 degrees Fahrenheit
Just waiting to put those buns in the oven and I'm a little bit nervous, because it is the first time I'm doing this. Couldn't wait until they are done.
Just made them! Came out really well, thank you Jenny! The written recipe states 25-30 mins, but next time I'll try 20 mins like in the video.
I want/need one of those dough scrapers!  Does anyone know where to get one?
Hi from the UK, I just stumbled on your channel, great recipe I've saved it to my recipe playlist. All the best steve
I really love this recipe, unfortunately living in Belgium, the flour is different, so it doesn't work for me.  I would appreciate any help/advice. Thanks ever so much.
Thanks Jenny  My first bread baking was huge success with this recipe!!
I love your smile :)
Recipe for rolls made from selfrising flour &  yogurt
Who is watching this in CV 19 Quarantine ??? April 2020
Where can I find that dough board?
Anyone else have these fail with so little yeast?
You are so sweet 🌹
Where did you get that great board?
A pleasant surprise at the end.  SMILE. 😊
Thank you Jenny! Your show is my favorite!!🙏💓
I’ve just started with making homemade bread.  So far I’ve made two overly densed  bread.  😑
The only thing that could improve upon the perfection of this video is for Jenny to slather that hot, crusty bun with a knob of country butter!
Just trying the amount of water should be a little more
How come 1 1/4 water wasn’t enough ?
Jenny, I've loved most of your recipes that I've made but these did not come out at all.  Probably operator error.  Ended up cooking them so much longer to brown a bit and then they got so hard, they could be used as baseballs.  lol.
Does anyone know what shelf in the oven to use? Low, middle, high? Looks wonderful!
Can we bake without yeast?
I have a question for Jenny. Do you also have a version for crusty buns, but with whole grains, like Spelt or Wheat? I love your video :)
I made these today and they were wonderful, thank you! I added a little bit of sugar and a tablespoon of olive oil to the dough. Perfect. I will bake them again very soon, and will try the loaf as well. Thank you so much!
Hi, Jenny. Can i add a little sugar on this recipe.
I love your recipes of bread.  But I cannot buy yeast anywhere.😭 No more yeast in the store because everyone is baking bread at home from now on with your recipes.😭
I wish I could make these delicious buns, but apparently flour & yeast are the new toilet paper.  Stores are completely sold out of these 2 basic items!
Your great love you videos x
Why does my rolls not come out as big?  Delicious and crusty but they come out very small.
How come you don't need to spray steam or have a plate in the over with some water ? Water steam make the crust nicer
That is exactly what I did.  I will let you know.
Made last night! Subbed in 1/4 cup of whole wheat flour, and put black olive slices into 1/2 of the dough. (4 plain, 4 olive buns) Delicious!
My dough is resting now but seems a lot drier than yours.  Not loose but dry !
e
I like your bench scraper!  What brand is it?   Thanks,   Marjorie
lovely
I love you Jenny .. Made up my day during quarantine
Thank you🙏 Where can I get a nice flour board like yours! Any link.
love Jenny, happy I stumbled on this while in Quarantine...loved her as a talk show host too...great sense of humor and fun to watch
My dough is always so wet even when I don't add all the water.
Hi Jenny. Forgot to ask. Can I double quantity and freeze after baking. Roll and bread.
Hi Jenny. Love your recipes.I started making rolls. I used 1c wholewheat flour minas 1c from ap flour. A pinch extra yeast and a little more water.After 3 hr.  When I wanted to shape it, dough became toooo wet. No problem. I made the bread. Wow so tasty. I discovered something that I'm going to do again. Thank you so much. Easy recipes. I also love yeast baking. Also helped friends and family start. They all enjoy it now with quarantine.God bless you. You helping and nobody has to be without BREAD. It's a staple food.  South African.
gonna have to try!!! ty
First thing I ever baked was her no knead bread. I was astonished at how perfect it came out. And so has every loaf since. Then did the pizza. OMG! Delicious. Now will try the buns. Jenny, how about baguettes? I followed another on YouTube and it was my first failure.
Can I adopt this lady as my next door neighbor?
Day # 30 in lock down in NYC, we must have made this 10 times since we went in quarantine, Fantastic. Thank You Jenny
Me, we are in England Essex
They came out like a solid rock using a gas oven.  No texture whatsoever and not crusty.
Tried this tonight during New Zealand Lockdown. Very happy with the result, can recommend. Thanks Jenny.
Fantastic!! Today, made them for the 3rd time, but the dough was really too wobbly. What to do? Thanks:)
You slay me ❣️
Drop that zero, and get you a hero!  Jenny Jones was my girl!  But really, made these tonight, first time ever making homemade bread, and they came out PERFECT!!!!  Make these rolls!
I subbed 1/3 whole wheat flour and the dough wasn’t as wet.  Still came out great!
Does this work with gluten free cup for cup flour?
OK, a huuuge THANK YOU for recipe! First time doing anything with yeast - kids are happy with result, husband is happy, I am happy :)
Hi Jenny! So I watched your video, headed straight to my kitchen, and made up this dough.  I found that I had to add maybe 2tsp. more of water, but other than that; it couldn’t have been easier.  Stuffed shells are on the menu for dinner, so I’m counting on these #buns to be the perfect compliment.👌🏾 And I absolutely love crusty bread!  TFS👍🏾
Gorgeous despite the Use By March 2018 yeast I used!
She is so funny.  I like her a lot. No nonsense cooking
Looks yummy 😋😋
You are lovely Jenny!  You make it so easy to understand your cooking process. 👌😊
Who is wishing yeast wasn’t hard to find now?

I just made these, ( and the faster ones she mentions below).  They turned out great - and so easy!  I personally enjoy kneading bread but I’ll happily skip it for a recipe that saves me this much time and bother
the parchment lining) isnt 450 too hot for parchment lining Please tell me anyone? btw I used whole what flour by mistake and they were ok I'm using white flour just now.
Me
I’ve tried this but the rolls were really flat 😢
why do you look so familiar...were you on a tv show that I cant think of?
crack up, love her
Thank you Jenny for sharing your receipes !
I'm and she is so funny. I love her
Thank you! My first time making bread, turned out just like yours and delicious. 🌷
Thank you Jenny..   I made these for my sons bday for chicken sandwiches during the quarantine.  It was a big hit.  I'm glad I found your channel.
Me! Wow. I cant wait to make these!
You sure make the day better during this quarantine. Keep these wonderful recipes coming. Thank you for work and personality.
Made the bread in a dutch oven and ate half before I could stop myself. Dang  CV-19 Quarantine.
Jeannie, I really enjoy your channel. I plan to try out this recipe.
Glad i found you! Miss you on TV!
I couldn’t figure out where you looked familiar... then it hit me like a ton of bread rolls. #TVtalkshowhost 💕
I ❤️ your floral board.
great recipe!
Can you make these in the slow cooker??
Hot water doesn't kill the yeast??
You were one of the best talk shows, and you are absolutely the best at giving simple, supportive instructions for cooking!!!
Looks great!😊👍❤️🙏
I make these now all the time they are sooooo good
I just made these and they are so delicious! Your recipes are so easy. Thank you. COVID-19 is giving me the opportunity to learn to bake and cook. Highly recommend this recipe.
I’m baking this today for my family! Seriously I’m in to bread baking during this quarantine
Dear Jenny, the inside of my dinner rolls turned out soft!  I wonder what happened?
I am and I am going to make rolls overnight then will cook them In the morning.
Thanks Jenny. Easy to follow, great presentation, cheerful host.
I love Jenny!
I’ve seen her before long ago. I can’t place it, but I think a TV show. Her personality reminds me of Betty White.
I can watch you all day1
Oh, I just LOVE your videos (you remind me of me!), and I too, just LOVE baking bread!  I've been at it for almost 40 years now, and am always learning new stuff from you! #LOCKDOWN2020 in #Ontario #Canada
Can I use wholewheat flour.
Hi Jenny just love 💕 love you’re you tube show thank you 😊 I have learned so much,I have been making bread 🥖 since My crochet 🧶 lady recommended you,and I am planing to make more ,I can’t wait to try the apple 🍎 pie 🥧 so long hope you have a good safe long  weekend  Mary.
Me Too. Yeast and flour on my shopping list.
Love ya beautiful smile! Lol
1gram,of yeast?
I love Jenny can cook. I really doo
I have made these 3 times already during  quarantine. They are easy to make and taste good!
You’re the most fun cooking channel to watch! You enjoy what you’re doing and it rubs off on your viewers!
we all get this is Jenny Jones from the talk show right? I agree good video presentation, but I keep expecting a boot camp Sargent to pop out.
Love your channel!  Do you have a recipe for yeast free bread?
Have you ever made them into onion rolls?
I have made the bread and when I have leftover bread if I put it in a plastic bag so it doesn't dry out it's not crunchy the next day how do you keep it crunchy  I guess the same would go for the rolls you're not going to eat all the rolls at one time if you only have two people
Thank you Jennie.   You are awesome.    God Bless you.
Omg I just made these and they are so delicious that I’m going to mix more dough to make tomorrow.  I was tired Last night and just just baked them tonight when it was convenient.  I didn’t even let them sit after I shaped them.  So easy and taste like sour dough.  Super crusty all around and soft inside.
One like for the smile alone lol
Making them tonight for a barbecue for two. Can't wait to cook for friends when all this is over. PS - if you can't find yeast, check with the bakery at a grocery store. They might be selling little tubs from their bulk bakery department's own supply of yeast. That's where I got mine (Safeway).
Jenny, I bought a dutch oven after seeing your video for no kneed dough. Can't wait to try these rolls
I have yet to get an answer from any bread maker for this question- help please!: What’s the easiest way to get that stuck on gummy flour out of bowl for cleaning it? If I add hot water it’s worse and tiny pieces get down drain to clog it up (& if use strainer in sink hole about impossible to clean out strainer.
I love you Jenny!  I love all your videos, you are so fun to watch, thank you!
Hi Jenny, I am making these as I type from St.Thomas Ontario (yes 15 money-saving minutes from London! Made 1 miss-step by adding hot water (from the tap) and then leaving batter over nite. It does not smell like a miss-step. Will follow up after supper tonight!
You can Cover IT  with a kitchen cloth....anderen Usern less plastic that was....appart fromm that I Like your Tutorial
Jenny, why have you not made any cooking videos in a while? I love watching these!! 🥰
Did them, LOVED them! 💝
I wonder why not in a warm Place to let dough rise?
Kind of sad it looks like she has stopped making recipes...thought I found my new follow 😊
Please help me.  First of all, I love your videos, and I have tried both of the bread recipes.  But I can't get my dough to rise.  Not like yours.  And the fist time I blamed it on my yeast not being fresh enough so I bought new.  The exact kind you  showed on your buns video.  And  I was exact on measuring everything for that also.  I was really looking forward to them and it didn't rise.  I have got to be doing something wrong.  And I am letting my water get very hot before I put it in my dry ingredients.  I want this to work.. So badly do I want this to work. Please help me.
Thanks Jenny! My family enjoyed (dads) home baking for the first time ever!
Such a joy to watch 🧡 getting ready to make my first ever homemade bread using this recipe... wish me luck 👍🏽
Jenny Can Cook, have you, or anyone else here, tried either all whole wheat, all white whole wheat, or even a mix of them with white flour? THANK YOU!!! P.S: We love your easy fast chocolate cake, everyone wants to eat it every day, so I try to forget to make it, or we will be having a hard time walking around soon :-)
Jennie, I love your videos.  They make me feel like I can cook just about anything---thank you:)
just made some   very easy to follow recipe  she,s right you need a high temperature  they came out superb thanks for the recipe
Could ya place a pan of water in oven with rolls and I believe it would make them even crustier
perfect on the first try and I'm not much of a baker. Such a great simple recipe and my house smelled like a French Patisserie. So excited tastier than buying bread can't wait to make this more often especially while quarantining.
Love her. She always Rock. Smart too.
Are you happy with your buns?! 🤣
I mis you :(
I have made the dough using 2-3 grams of fresh yeast instead of the dry one, dissolved it in the hot water and now, after 3h, I am still waiting to see if it it will rise... (I am also replacing the dry yeast with fresh yeast for the no knead bread when I don't have dry yeast and the bread always turns out just perfect!) I do hope I did not ruin the dough..  I'll come back later with an update :D
Thank you so much for the nice video. Can we use for this recipe whole meal flour?
It's a very typical Belgian thing, the name is pistolets, you find them everywhere in the bakery. Always crusty at the top and soft inside (if it's a good bakery... because these days -:( .. ) The inside you eat with fresh butter and some salt..after that you can put gouda cheese, ham, scrambled eggs...salads between it...they have a notch in the middle so you can easily separate them in two if necessary. And no In France (except Flanders France against the Belgian border) they do not have this. In the Netherlands provinces against the Belgian border they are also common...but not so crusty. The U.S. influence? They also use them for hamburgers on festivals etc... I am not sure if Americans would approve that.Cursing in the church??
I LOVE your sense of humor. The ending was hilarious.
Thanks.
Even a half brain, dumbass like me can bake that bread! I`m gonna bake that for my baby and maybe, just maybe I`ll get lucky tonite. I wonder if I can do it with whole wheat instead of white flour because of the carb content... Thanks Jenny for making it so simple to bake bread! Cheers!
Li vcd e it. Your funny, I love your teeth🦷🦷🦷😃😃😃😄
omg your teeth!!! great video thank you fro sharing
Cant wait to make these!  I have been wanting an "easy" recipe for bread rolls and this will be perfect - Thank you Jenny!! PS.  Great video!!!
Heilo , Jenny. Do you have a recipe for unleavened pita bread? Tks so much.  I enjoy your bread making recipes.Stay well.
Covid19 home baking. When I went to get ingredients, I had plenty of flour at home as I do bake but the flour was gone off the shelf, and yeast had been left there. I can only imagine people bought flour but didn't know there was such thing as yeast until they came to make it. I bought plenty of yeast before the second round of baking panic buy where the yeast then disappeared.
So simple method and the result is Awesome 👍👌🤩😋 gourgios
Can I use sprouted wheat flour in this recipe?
Mmm.  I thought hot water killed the yeast
Jenny you made me  happy
"Are you happy with your buns?" Hahahha
Yet to try the recipe but I’m in cos she’s so adorable!
Great video and I've never heard an American say water comes out of a tap before.
ME
She is so sweet!
Good afternoon! I’ d like to have the scone recipie ! May I? Thank you very much. You are amazing
I love your videos, they're so approachable and friendly! Thank you!
Jenny is adorable!!
LOVE JENNY
I love you!
Thanks  Jenny, I had 8 rocks....fiasco! Is flour really that different in Europe!
This lady funny
What style and grace you have!  I enjoy watching your videos as much as I enjoy eating the results.
Jenny, you are making a difference in my life during a global pandemic. Thank you for your videos. I'm a registered nurse and YOU are my hero! You're the real MVP!
Thank you Jenny for another great video. I'm new to bread making, going to try this recipe right now.
Jenny please show us how to make scones.  Will frequently watch for reply.  Thank you. Love your show!
Hi Jenny, I tried your recipe the out surface looks great but the inner was still wet and rubbery. I cooked at 450 for 30 minutes and did it another 25 minutes and still it didn't turn out. What am I missing?
LOL. you're  funny. Thanks for the recipe!
Do you have any crusty bread good Gluten-free recipe please? Many thanks
No one is happy with their buns...
You are so fun to watch and listen to while I'm sewing or crocheting.  😊
I'm making this for DIY Quarantine Bread Making Sunday tomorrow. Trying to find Yeast is like trying to find face masks right now. However, i have a feeling that for the rest of the year, Stores are all going to sell a lot less bread because many of us will have gotten way too much practice making bread and no longer buying store bread. At least for a while.
tried them and my husband loved them. So easy and I am excited as you were.
Has anyone tried adding olive oil to this?
Jenny, you are so good and easy to watch your recipes,  Chef Abe
I love watching your show and I love it because it’s very clear and straight forward
I have always loved Jenny’s shows. Forget if she was on public tv but would watch years ago. She’s wonderful!!!

Has anyone else made this without parchment paper? I have run out!
Hi Jenny, can I use an air fryer to do this cos my place doesn’t have an oven.thx in advance. Love your vids
❤️🥰👏👏👏
Thanks for sharing your recipe.
You are simply beautiful
Jenny, come back. We need you.
I'm going to try this.
"Are you happy with your buns? I am!"  I love this woman.
Jenny I have made these for a week now and I love them , these have been a great help during this coronavirus outbreak where we can't get fresh bread easily  You are a wonder love   Thanks for all your videos  I have subscribed and I'm looking forward to the next videos thanks again,   Dave Allen of Derby England
I've made a batch of these. Was an instant hit! Everyone's asking for more. 😂
Jenny, is there any problem making 4 bigger rolls and not 8 small ones? If so, just leave in the oven a little longer?
Can't watch this. Why are Americans incapable of learning how to use normal measures of volume? What the f*ck is a 'cup' of flower?
Hello from Germany 😀 I stay at home . 😷😷😷
Started with making my own bread since ECQ (Enhanced Community Quarantine)
Can you use a sourdough starter in this recipe?
My first time ever hitting that subscribe button.  Love your videos!  :-)
Omg Jenny thank you so much I just made this today and they came out so good no more going out to buy bread during this time
jenny I just made my rolls and put them on baking sheet however, your dough looks bigger than mine, and I waited 3 hrs and 15 min, but I hope they turn out. My yeast was not fast acting. It was the regular kind but same company Fleischmanns. God I hope they turn out!  I'll report later after they're done!
Instead of water, could one use a mix of warm milk and melted butter ?
Ooo I’m making these tonight! So glad I found this! Why aren’t you doing videos anymore? You are so fun!
Would cutting this dough in to 6 pieces instead of 8 make them come out hamburger bun size? Its hard to tell how large the buns are :)
Oh my goodness thank you for the recipe and laugh, on my birthday.
So good to see that you don't have any jewelry on your hands and wrists whilst cooking. A lot of eveb pro chefs ignore this simple basic hygiene principle when cooking.
I already love this and how simple you make it. But the smile at the end really sealed the deal!! This will be a great way to make my household smile during this quarantine! Little did you know that you'd become such an inspiration during this otherwise crappy time!
They actually cam out! Perfect and delicious! Thanks!!
Gonna try this tomorrow I miss having fresh bread while self isolating....thank you Jenny 🙏
Good instructions! Thank you!
I wonder if she’s going make some new videos.......since March 2020 her fan base tripled
Thanks for your great recipe Jenny, it worked extremely well and it’s nice to see your enthusiasm and humour during these tough times! I added some nigella seeds on top which worked a treat.
looking great in this yellow top !! and of course the rolls too! love these no butter,/eggs /fuss kind of recipes ! here we do not get nor afford fancy ingredients ,SO PLEASE keep on giving this type of easy recipes at least till the lock down !?
I rarely eat gluten but this bread works and absolutely loved it. if I want to eat bread at least I make sure its the healthier type.. thanks Jenny. love your YouTube channel. im from Malaysia by the way.
No criticism but, I'm not sure what the attraction is for "no knead".  If you have to let the yeast have it's 3 hours, who cares if you need to knead it?  I actually like the kneading.  Still I will have to try this.
Jenny, I tried but my dough was a bit dryer than yours. I followed the same amount of water but somehow mine turned out not as sticky and wet. In addition, I also used active dry yeast and my dough did not raised like your so when it was done my bread was a bit tough in the inside. I think it will be helpful if you can explain more with the type of yeast. I read from google active dry yeast requires water to activate. Also, you said just add hot water, how hot is hot because I think it’s important for the yeast to raise.
Wondered what happen to you after the Talk Show. I like it. A peaches and cream Martha Stewart, with a desire for a job in comedy.
Always love watching you cook/bake - love your sense of humour -  tried all your recipes and always come out delicious! Thanks for sharing and keep smiling:)
oh, my goodness. I tried this with Whole Wheat flour! It turned out GREAT! Even better actually!  I had to change the water to 3/4 cup. That was the only change. Fantastic. I will be making rolls from now on, I never knew they were so easy!!! thank you, thank you, thank you for your recipe!
Looks yummy 😋😋😋😋😋😋👏👏👏👌👌
WAIT!!! Is this Jenny Jones from Daytime Talk Shows???
Does anyone notice how she looks like Phoebe from "F.R.I.E.N.D.S"???
I can’t figure out what I’m doing wrong.  My dough is shaggy and not wet.  Are you sure these are the correct measure,ents ?
👍🎂👌🙏
Du är jättebra.
Thank you for sharing.  They look so good.  21 day lockdown in SA so plenty time to try them 😊
Jenny,  you are so delightful and have a marvelous sense of humor!! Thanks for your wonderful recipes and your enthusiasm for the finished products!!
I made it and ended up with wonderful bread balls. They didn't puff up and spread out. They're good but definitely a bread ball. lol
Those look delicious!
This is great
Her gags crack me up🤣
Can you use whole wheat flour?
1 1/4 cups is 300ml?  I'm asking from across the pond :) Anyway, fabulous little video! Thank you! And I love Jenny's genuine joy of cooking too!
Thanks so much. I'm already waiting the 3 hours for the dough! Looking forward... Yammi.
Yummy
Great presentation and lovely woman!
SOMEHOW BREAD DOUGH STILL NEEDS KNEADING... SO TO TAKE OFF TOO MUCH AIR BUBBLES THAT MAKES D BREAD AWFUL LIGHT N NIT WHOLESOME TO EAT...
These look like mini baguettes! Is it the same flavor?
I’ve made this with air fryer. It’s easy, my family likes it. Thank you very much.
Thanks for pronouncing Ciabatta correctly , great video
Love the new teeth! LOL! What a clown! So cute.
Has anyone tried these with gluten free flour? I am going to have to try and see! They look so easy!
Can someone help me out with a question?  My oven only took 15 minutes to reach 450 degrees. Should I still leave the rolls sitting for 35 minutes? Is it a required time to actually raise a bit? Thanks.
Made these rolls, super easy. They come out just like she said.
Are you happy with your buns ooooerrr missus
Thank you
Can this bread sit on counter longer than 3 hours like the no knead bread?
Who's watching this while in CV-19 Quarantine?  March 2020.
I made mine but it became too hard! I am not sure what I have done wrong! any leads???
You say 450 Fahrenheit what is it in English please
Jenny, we love bread too! Yesterday I finally gave your no-knead-rolls a try. They were soooooooo good. Eight rolls gone in a moment. My girls said it was the best bread I ever made. I mixed up double the amount last night, with cold water. Here I am waiting for my second big batch. We live in Southern Spain, we are secluded due to covid-19 and cooking (I am the father here) is a good medicine. Have our thanks and love. Keep well.
Yes! Awesome recipe. Super easy, and as we all seem to have more time on our hands (some of us), great and worked out perfect.
I like the recipe but she's awkward to watch...
35 minutes till the oven is ready?! Omg
Thanks a lot for the recipee, they look great and I want to try make them. Just one question: you say "very hot water". Not lukewarm as we use to do with yeast. So hot water does not kill yeast?
Hi.. Been watching your recipes a few times.  Where are you from.. I know ive seen you from somewhere and recognize the voice?
Adopt me
I used to make a six hour baguette that was my families favorite.  Until they had these rolls.  It's MUCH less work and tastes great. Thanks, Ms. Can Cook.
Jenny can u please tell me how much water Did u use in  grams?Thanx 4 sharing this useful & easy recipe😊
I’m about to go do this right now! 😃
Love you Jenny. Making  these with my grandson. Will let you know how they turn out.
Too much salt! Cut it in half. And unless you KNOW your pipes are in great condition, boil cold water first and let it cool. (Or do it overnight as she says).
Thanks can't wait to try these! But 35 minutes to preheat your oven?
Can you make these in microwave
u r really funny..thank u for the recipe..it looks so easy...will do it since we cant go out of the house ..
Is the flour aerated as for the chocolate cake?
But, but ........ .  Am I the only one who saw the crumb hadn’t developed? Crust looked great but the crumb, not so much.
Gonna give these Crusty Corona Rolls a bash today (out of bread and not allowed out here). Fingers crossed....
i like your bread baking etcetera etcteras thanks for the video :D
Is this Jenny Jones who had the talk show in the 90's???
Love ya teef!! Haaaa - love your recipe and for a non cook like me, I'm sure I'll be ok
Well don't know you well but if you have a husband, he is one lucky guy.
"Are you happy with your buns?" OMG!! so funny. Love you Jenny
Oh my gosh this was my first jenny can cook video and it was just so delightful! Thank you for posting this, can't wait to try~
Goodbye keto! Besides, bread with 6 to 7 ingredients doesn't have the same effect on my glucose as store bought bread.
what a smile... :))
Love your enthusiasm. It's contagious... I'll give these a try for quarantine.
Looks delicious and easy but is it  hygienic to cover food with cloth ?  My domestic science guru would object.
Love Jenny! I'm going to try these too! March 25, 2020 Stay, safe, healthy and happy! We'll get through this together! Love from Ontario, Canada! =o)
I think my buns rose a little too much.🍑😂
Your so inspiring :D
I've been making her no knead bread for a few months now and never had a failure. I've added things like shredded cheddar (1/2 cup) and chopped jalapenos (2 Tbsp), or various seeds (2 Tablespoons). Wife loves it with caraway seeds, (2 Tbsp). Make sure you mix the dry ingredients first, then add the wet stuff.  At first I was worried that the dough was very wet and sticky. Now I make sure the dough is wet and sticky! I've made 3 or 4 of her recipes  and they all turned out perfect. This one will be my next project! Stay safe everyone!
Thank You Very much! Big hugs!
I  like your enthusiasm  you show the love  of your cooking
Instead of dividing it into eight rolls, could the dough be cut in half, with each half rolled and stretched  and baked as two small baguettes?
Your videos  cheer up my day.  Your hair and clothes , your attitude, the way you explain ,  and the awesome recipes all make it so great and happy. Now that pig timer and your other cute timers... How I would love just one of them!  Can't find them anywhere!
Hello Jenny, made these rolls and they came out really good! Really enjoy your simple and informative videos! As you had said, made these with all-purpose flour, and although still crunchy, somewhat chewier than bread flour. Keep em coming!
Is this jenny jones?
I  tried one of your breads twice and came out like stones. Won't be trying  anymore  bread from you sorry
You are so silly! I love it!
Omg, you are the freshest thing on YouTube!  We need, more of you and the guy who plays the piano for elephants! Much love and gratitude
I am watching this from South Africa whilst we are in lockdown due to Covid19. Thank you, Jenny for sharing your wonderful video recipes with us. You are adorable to watch. I am so looking forward to trying them! 😘
Are you happy with your buns?  Hahaha...
I tried to smell my screen when she cut open the freshly cooked roll!
These look amazing!  Will this recipe work with Spelt or Oat flour?  I think I will add rosemary and garlic. 😊
I am so glad I found your channel.  It's nice to see you.  And Jenny Can Cook!
I absolutely LOVE watching your cooking show!  I've learned a lot and your humor is refreshing.  I find myself laughing out loud!
I’ve never met anyone who gets as excited about bread as much as I do!  It’s the German in me.
What a perfect roll! Now to find some yeast .
need to use a damp tea towel not plastic!
I love her! She looks fantastic. I was surprised when she said it takes her oven 35 minutes to heat 🤣
I don’t have a dutch oven that’s why I came to this video. Yay!
My dough was no where near that wet after mixing.
I am so happy. I just made these ( cold water overnight sit) They turned out fantastic!!! I am so happy I can do this.
Just made these, I took your suggestion on the egg white brush and sesame seeds, never buying bread again. Thank you for a wonderful life lesson and an easy recipe in these testing times.
These would be lovely to make except no yeast to be found this week
Mine is dry dough. Not at all loose like yours...hmmm?
So, I started with some doubts, continued with hope and ended up with the best loaf ever!  Thank you.
OMG, I am so glad this came up as a suggestion. I'm an indifferent cook at best (although what I DO know how to cook, I cook very well!) I grew up eating Mom's homemade bread and I tell you what, not much on this Earth smells so good. I'm definitely going to give this a go and see what else you've got that I can try. Thanks so much! Gonna surprise my sister with a batch one day, lol.
Jenny...my small oven can only max 250 temparature... can it be done.
Can you skip the cutting process and bake it like a bread? Whole? without covering? i dont have dutch oven
Thanks, Jenny! I'm disabled and unable to kneed dough. The supermarkets have stopped selling my usual rolls in order to utilise the shelves for essentials. Your recipe will enable me to have fresh rolls every day! Thank youuu! ❤️
No i'm not. That's why i'm here to look at yours!
Oh man!!!! Making these today... I just love her☺️
This is my first time Baking. Looking forward to the smell in the kitchen. Thank you so much it looks easy. God bless you all during Our quarantine
I love the fact that she still wears pigtails in her hair!
Great and simple
is it me, or does anyone else want to tell her ROLL up Your Selves !!  =)  love u Jenny.!
Wouldn't it be easier to oil your hands
she didnt mean to ruin that baseball
REFINED white flour is NOT HEALTHY AT ALL.
You're hilarious! loved the show! and I learned something.
Thank you, Jenny!
Thank you Jenny. I've just discovered you. I'm trying the no-knead bread in Dutch oven when I go out to get flour. Now I'm sheltered in Illinois. I was wondering if you have an easy recipe for French/Italian bread? Thank you so much. Jose
Use ONLY UNBLEACHED FLOUR ppl. Just bc it's on the grocery shelves doesn't mean it's safe 2 eat.  All purpose flour has been scientifically proven to be CANCER CAUSING bc of the chemical processing.
She’s adorable
Hey Jenny Jones you look great thanks for your video today..
Honestly the cutest baking personality I've seen on YouTube. I'm making these today!
Oh I'm totally going to make these for my family the next time we have a roast dinner!
You are absolutely beautiful. I love watching you. Thank you and God bless you. ✝️
Love your brightly colored kitchen ware too!!!
Oh Jenny, you are so stinking cute! These look yummy!
This is great!!! Thanks!!!!
Thank you that was amazing!! I can’t wait to make the rolls!
😁
Thank you Jenny. Much love!
Prepped 100lbs of flour and i can't cook so now i can. Thanks
I know I knew that voice! It is Jenny Jones!
Making these bad boys tomorrow!😋
Can you use gluten free flours?
Jenny please post more recipes!! Where are you?
Ha ha ,, had to laugh at the opening sentence "are you happy with your buns" LOl   in the U.K. here your buns is a colloquialism for ladies breasts...Ha Ha.
1/4 teaspoon does not seam like enough?
Jenny can your insane ...I LOVE your videos Thankyou I'm in heaven in my kitchen 💕💕
Its lockdown + curfew in sri lanka..could not find bread in all the chaos after the curfew announcement. So glad to come across this easy bread bun recipe 😀
You're so cute Jenny!  God bless you.
Jenny, you are absolutely adorable and can cook!!! Love from Bangkok ❤️
Also gave this a try in Covid isolation, staying with my elderly mother for the duration to look after her... I proofed some yeast beforehand because it's a little out of date. It seemed very energetic but I used a full teaspoon in the recipe just in case. Flour was plain white. Water was 72C.   I got no rise at all though. Just solid lumps that made me think of ships biscuit from the Townsends channel... What can I do to make this work? I'm concerned that the salt is killing the yeast (all mum has is iodised table salt), and there's no sugar in there to really feed it either.
Great vid and I will try it.  Thanks.  J.
I’m sorry Jenny but I’m a baker and when you cut open that roll it didn’t look fluffy and airy on the inside like bread should. It looked like a big wad of raw dough with a crisp cracker crust.  Bread truly needs yeast or something to make it rise and become fluffy. Plus the yeast gives the bread a good flavor. I’m sure you can come up with a recipe for bread using yeast or something else to make the bread rise.
Amazing!  Thank you for sharing!
I love your videos and your smile is awesome. 🥰  I have a question about this recipe. I'm on a carbohydrate and sugar restrictive diet. Can I use almond or coconut flour and granulated swerve sugar substitute instead of those used in the video?
I made these today while being “self confined”. Mine sure weren’t as pretty as yours, but so good tasting! Keep it up, you are great!
JENNY!!!! Where are you? Come back, puhleeze!!!
Can’t wait to try them. I love bread.
Oh Jenny, how I miss you! We need you back!
I wish you was my neighbor !
you are a nut.... lol
Can I double this recipe to make these rolls big enough for sandwiches?  It's nearly impossible to find bread in the stores now.  You are a lifesaver in these crazy times!
I've been making sourdough baguettes  lately  but tomorrow  I'll try your recipe.  Thank you 🙏😷
very simple . thanks  I would definitely try this one.. BTW I have seen bread like this but the insides are brownish in color, what  what flour do you think they used?
Is anyone really happy with their buns?
Can I use plain flour ? X
Bread with only 1/4 tsp yeast?  These will be my quarantine go-to!
She's cute! 👀❤🙈
You have such a lovely way about you. I love your videos
I love this woman and her great cooking skills..Sure wish she were my neighbor...
MARRY ME...😍😍😍
wow you are too cute!! thank you for the video! :D
Love your video, going to make some
Thanks for sharing
take care, Jenny
love your recipes - i also love bread AND POTATOES.  bad combo but it keeps me exercising!
Oh my god. I needed to see this.  I’m following this lady!
I would be happy with her buns !  😊
very nice roll easy simple 🇺🇸👍🇺🇸👍 Thanks
I love your kitchen..😍😘👍🏼
waaw
O
Perfect texture for saucy pulled pork or chicken sandwiches!
Can you use whole wheat flour?
You’re so fun to watch and listen to! I love your quirky humor! ☺️😄
shes amazing always excited when out of the oven well done thx
Ill be her summer vacation... One of the only times she wont be dealing w yeasts... Shes blessing everyone w the skills... Lets be reciprocal...
Thanks Jenny! Love your sense of humor & your recipes are great. My daughter & I are making the bread & we will be able to supply our neighbors with fresh bread during this time of craziness at the supermarket.
We tried it and followed the recipe exactly, twice, but in both cases the dough did not rise enough. May be 1/4 spoon  yeast is not enough? may be the yeast should go in hot water first to allow it to rise before adding to dough? not sure.
I have tried almost all of your recipes and have not found one that I didn't just absolutely love. thank you Jenny we really appreciate it
After adding the 1 1/4 cup hot water my dough looks dry. Anyone else notice this?
Loved you on your talk show, love you even more now..so glad I found your channel Jenny 👍🙌🏼🙂I'll be baking these today while in self quarantine
Awesome Jenny, you make it look so easy! Can you add some melted butter (4Tbs) to that recipe for a buttery roll or would that require more kneeding and rise time?
I‘ve made these multiple times in my life now and it‘s safe to say they‘re always all gone before they‘ve even cooled down :P PS: they make absolutely AMAZING sesame rolls which are to die for
why no sugar for the yeast?
Can I just say that your kitchen is beautiful
Thank you Jenny your videos are so pleasant and your recipes so easy to follow.
Thank you Jenny i love your video's
My goodness, I just ate three of these right out of the oven with real butter.  Better than sex as I remember it.....blush.
You are so awesome!
Jenny. So simple and so nice.thank you.u r wonderful.
Excellent video. Thanks a lot.
Could you make pizza dough with this recipe?
I new here. She doesn't make videos any more? That's a shame. She's great.
You're too darn cute.  I am baking some bread now, cause you stirred me up.
Wow....found your recipe for easy crusty bread yesterday morning and just had to try it...just delicious.......love watching you ,loved your show way back when and always enjoy your soft ,calm voice....just found the recipe for the crusty rolls and will be trying those too....great job Jenny...keep at it you are awsome!
LOL, my husband gets that "pure happiness" 😁 smile for bread. 🍞
Hi Jenny! It's great to see you. Thanks for the recipe. I'm a bit of a bread person too. "Listen to that crust." I made these last night and they are fantastic.  Talk about crusty!  I've been looking for good hard rolls locally for years.  The bakery we go to never makes them crusty enough for my taste and they never make enough.  You have made me very happy. I think I was as excited as you to see them come out of the oven. Mmmm with butter!  I'm going to have another one right now.
How do I print recipe
The rolls look east to make not to mention delicious 😋
You should NOT be using water from the hot tap to put into food. It's not meant to be consumed.
Thanks for sharing this with us on here.The Bread Rolls Look So yummy and I am amazed how quick it took you to make them.These are a must try.
Made these today and burnt them a bit but they were still soo soft and beautiful on the inside! The burning was my fault, I didn’t convert from Fahrenheit to Celcius and just figured it would be as hot as possible - turns out my oven gets quite hot, haha. Still delicious! Will make them again tomorrow!
I love this woman! She brings such fun to her recipes.  I'm going try them ALL!  Go Jenny.
Just made this recipe. These are awesome.
She's queen
Where as Jenny been.i hope shes ok
You are the cutest.
March 15-2020 - I love the video but I have tried to do it... Never got it!  :-(  --- Bread dough never comes close to the video ...  I wish I could find why!  meantime I’ll keep enjoying the posted videos.
These will be my quarantine bread rolls!  Easy to follow instructions & love your enthusiasm and excitement.
Jenny, you are too cute. I love your quick, no knead bread recipes. Thank you for teaching us. 😊
Isn’t this the pan stove top pizza dough?  I’m Def making this Tho. My son loves bread.
I love your joy! Thank you
Can this bread be made with Almond flour?
You and your bread are great. Thank you will make these rolls tomorrow.
LOL she put on funny teeth at the end!
Very nice...I just don't understand how the yeast is not killed with that hot water 🙎😳
I'm happy with my bunZ! Lol
Can the rolls be made with part whole wheat flour?
They look EXCELLENT,. going to try this afternoon,.. many thanx
I remember her from her talk show years ago. I recognized her voice before I recognized her face. I can’t wait to try these rolls
She reminds me of phoebe from friends
Adorable! ♥️
I love your bread...
Thank you for your fun video.
I tried them .they didn't come out good🤦‍♀️ I did everything exactly..will try it again thou
Love your buns Jenny 😁
Jenny you r so nice fun and beautiful great teacher  thankyou so much
I love her cooking. She makes it look so simple. But didnt the inside of the baked roll look undercooked ??????????
Bread is food of the gods!
What a delightful personality. Please come back!
A GREAT GIGGLE ENDED IT AND I JUST MADE YOUR BREAD YESTERDAY!!! THANKS.
Hot cross buns
quick an easy  you  cant be to plezzzzyyy    just eat it so  eassssyyy
I was waiting for her to fight with the roll of plastic wrap...didn't happen.  :(    lol
you don't scrape all off the bowl first one not as well shaped by a bit point edge
i dont often comment but you are a presios gem
I’m an idiot as I made this recipe this week and forgot to preheat my stoneware! Duh! When I realized this my mood took a dive. However I just left it in the oven longer and followed the next steps. It was delicious in spite of me.
This recipe exact came out dry for me... what do I do? Add more water in small splashes?
You are an angel...to make baking and cooking so easy. Thank you!
She has a very happy personality.  Not like most women her age who seem to be on menopause.  Lol
I love it
This is a great recipe. I make them into small baguette loaves bake then cut them into little rounds, brush with garlic butter and brown under the broiler. I also shape them into oblong buns.  Next I’m going to try making rye buns, just not use all white flour.
Are you happy with your buns 🤣
for breakfast, I added raisins to the buns, brushed them with cinnamon mixed with granulated sugar & honey to get them to stick to the dough before baking them. Delicious with coffee.
You’re awesome!
Jenny's easy no knead the dough bread it works for me  keep smiling and happy cooking 😁🇬🇧
What a great video and recipe. Thank you!  I made these yesterday and they were so good, BUT I had a small problem. My buns got hard before they got brown. The flavor was great,  but the crust was too hard. I'm wondering if I could *brush them with butter or oil and bake them at a slightly higher temp* (like 475°)  to get them brown and to cook them for less time?
Martha Stewart has nothing on YOU!  You are a great speaker with a super attitude,  fun to watch, and obviously a wonderful cook! Thanks for sharing those beautiful, delicious looking rolls which as a bread lover, I will definitely make! Thank you so much for sharing! ❤️
Jenny is my new favorite youtuber
I was wondering why you looked so familiar. Then I realized that you're Jenny Jones from the talk show.
Why has Jenny stopped making us laugh on a talk show....
Jenny, can I use 1-for-1 gluten free flour to make these?
I never thought making bread would be so easy, thank you for restoring my primal need to make my own bread 😀
Love it. Gonna make it
Hoping this post is still monitored I have an issue with density. 2.5 cups flour, 1.25 cup hot water, the yeast and salt.  My dough is solid (for lac of a better description) after the 3hr testing period it is still solid. Rolls did not cook fully and were very dense.   I'm tempted to add an additional 1/4 cup water.
What is the advantage, if any, of using bread flour instead of all purpose flour?
I’m making BREAD! Thank you for this recipe!
wow its amazing。welldone。
These will be our favorite bun recipe for eva!!!!!! They came out perfect!
I thought only indians make this mistake is it or should it be smell or Fragrance
My oven doesn’t taken 30+ minutes to reach 350...why is her oven so slow???
You are just as cute as a bug.    (Bugs are cute)  You are so fresh and happy and not going on about a bunch of irrelevant stuff.   Thank you and keep up the great lessons.
The teeth killed me 😂
I learned this from you.tks
Nice madam
Wish she was back on the news, she's real n funny!
If you make larger bread rolls does that affect the cooking time?
Just love your ``No knead bread`` and this rolls is also sooo nice! Thank`s a lot for charing. Before I used to bake the same boring bread for many years. Emilia (Sweden)
Jenny is helping me get over the fear of using yeast. I’ve had so many failures and yet Jenny makes the process look so easy!
I love the way you bake, easy to follow, I always make your recipes! Thanks 🙏
Made them today. WOW! Never made bread before. So easy and SOOOOOO good!  <3
I got as excited as you did after taking these out of my oven and trying for the  1st time (20 mins ago), gotta make another batch right now..👍♨️🥖🍞,, thank you..
thanks, Jenny -
i have one question.  don't you think just a 1/4 tsp of yeast is too little - my rolls did not puff up very much
hi i love your recipe you think you can make those baps and freeze it before putting in the oven   ?
I'm sure you have deliciously wonderful buns.
Can you add sugar
i think i have seen you on TV before but don't quite remember - i baked my rolls for 20 minutes but the top did not turn out so crusty.  i like mind crusty. but mine were quite dense.
hello - i made these rolls but mine turned out quite dense.  i am not sure why.  should i be using bread flour
Nicely art-directed too! Great ‘set’ and costume.;-)
For those of us in metric land: 130F = 54C and 450F = 232C
Can this be made with self rising flour? Has anyone tried?
This looks so easy and delicious. I think I can do this one
1/4 tsp. Of yeast not 1/4 ounce???
What kind of flour do use for kneading? All purpose or more bread flour?
Hi Jenny!!!  My daughter Tina made your bread not long ago. It was her first time at bread making!!! It came out so...good. I will have to tell her about this recipe too. The buns looks so...Yummy. I have to try these!!!
Hi👋, I start watching your videos a few weeks ago, I like that you try not to use butter or milk in your baking, I love your video for these rolls and your chocolate cake, looks very easy and delicious, you are fun to watch!!!
شكرا Thank you so much
I added one and a quarter cups of hot water and my dough was really dry. I double checked all the ingredients and did it again, same result.....what am I doing wrong?😩
How does the yeast work without sugar?
Every time I see your Jenny Can Cook, my heart just feels so warm inside.  Like the rolls.  You are HILARIOUS.  Thank you for the fun.  I am on the Keto Diet right now so I’m eating all the bread I want with my eyes 👀 🤤 🍞
Delicious easy recipe , just finished making it , overnight cold water version , I would add a bit if sugar for more sweetness , doubled the recipe and cake out great 🙏🏻
Hey, Jenny, excited to try many of your bread & roll recipe s. Yours looks so good and seems simpler than anyone else's!  I quit making bread sometime ago, due to my arthritis making it difficult to do all the kneading! Wish me luck 😄
No sugar no milk?
Love your humor , and instruction Can I use spelt flour for similar results ?
Jenny is great - and nice buns too! (And what a coincidence that her other names are 'Can' and 'Cook'! The rolls are even greater! But why does she keep saying 'Kind of'?! ("kindov puffy, kindov a loose dough, kindov fold it over, kindov make it not so sticky, kindov a circle (my favorite!), kindov a round shape, some kindov a dish towel."   And if it takes 35 minutes to warm up her oven, she kinov 'kneads' a better one!
Hiw about adding some dried apricots, cranberries,...I bet that taste wonderful too..
Can I get some low fat. Or almond flour
I love your videos and your sense of humor. Thanks for making me smile! :-)
Love you videos and have just made the crusty rolls, but I would like them more airy inside.  Do you have any suggestions?  Next I will be making your paczkis
Jenny where are you??
A Dutch oven in the UK is when you fart under the blankets, when you're sharing a bed.
Ha haaaaa. The teeth at the end though 😳 🤣😂👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
I was an excellent student for sure you were my dear teacher ...with out a doubt
You might want to have your oven checked out if it takes 35 min to get to 450. Doesn’t seem right...
Thanks Jenny..
it appears as if they were dusted with flour before baking... am I  right?
Oh man, what a gift to the world this woman is. If only my future wife can cook like this.
Will it do if rubbing your hands with cooking oil to shape your little doughs?
Hi Jenny. I love your bread recipes. I love bread too. And the smell is to die for. My husband is going to love the rolls. A question? Can you you use a wet dishcloth or would it be too damp. Thank you for your recipes. I am looking forward to more. I missed you so much when your show went off the air.
I can't wait to make this
Omg you had me ROTFL at the end 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣🌸 just love you, making them today....thank you so much for your time and happy charm 🥰😘🦋💐
Jenny , you are hilarious. And we love you. Love your simple recipes.
R u Jenn from TV a few years ago?
THANK YOU!!!!!!
Hi Jenny Jones!
Followed this to the letter. But my rolls did not have the golden brown on top. Am I doing something wrong? 😟
Love everything except hot tap water...the buns look so crunch and yum...6:08 🤣
Will be given these a go, they look great.😁
she reminds me of Bob Ross. There.
I just made these today  and they came out PERFECT. I am an awful baker but this recipe I can follow. Thanks
Can you use butter on the pan instead of parchment paper?
The end. Lol cute 🤣
very nice lady
YO! what do you do with leftover yeasts?
Look very easy
You are so adorable!
How do you the crespy??
Wife and I make bread fairly often, so we decided to give these a try. They were lovely ceramic pieces - looked like rolls. I thought of using them in place of clay targets for sporting clays, but was afraid the shot would ricochet due to the hardness of the rolls. Totally inedible. BUT...I still love Jenny's buns...  A 450 degree over still not as hot as Jenny.
You are adorable. And your rolls look good, too!
I Love how easy all her recipes are
I tried this recipe it is very simple but the measurements are not right, there isn’t enough salt and not enough yeast!
You're very pleasant to listen to and your editing is perfect.  Not a lot of in between jibber jabber.  Plus great recipes.  The Dutch oven bread recipe was fantastic.  So enjoy your videos, don't stop. 😊 🍞 👍🏼🇨🇦
If they taste like my dear mom’s, I am on the road to fat !
Your enthusiasm Is contagious, I will definitely surprise my family with these biscuits and bread. Thank you
such a goof ball you are! Love it!!
I cannot get over how easy and consistent this dough is!! Amazing made it a few times and everyone who tries it loves it! Even put grated cheese in a batch THANK YOU!!
mine stuck to the paper be better greasing the tray
Gracias otra ves..
Ur hilarious.  Thanks jenny
Why do Americans ALWAYS give only USA measurements? Cups and Fahrenheit? What about the rest of the world watching? Don’t they have weighing scales in America? It’s like in the UK also,they STILL refuse to use metric and Celsius!!
Looks great. Can’t wait!! Thank you. I remember you from years ago. Thought you looked familiar.
Thank you so much. God bless.
I just want to say you are the most fascinating person to watch on all my YouTube friends. You are so positive in a down to earth funny way. Your like cooking with a room full of friends. Thank you for all your recipes that I’ve accumulated and tried. I find myself looking forward to seeing you again with new recipes. Again thank you. By the way I don’t bake regular bread anymore since we fell in love with the Crusty bread and rolls.
Lovely lady.
I LOVE her !
I could be happy with your buns.
Am I happy with my buns?  OH DEAR!!!BLUSHING
Music
Awesome!!!!!
JENNY.. CAN THESE BE FROZEN.. BAKED OR UNBAKED??
Doris Day with a modern edge! I like.
ووووو...مممممممممممممم
You're funny Jenny...real sense of humor:-)
Thanks for putting the weight measurements rather than 'cups'. So much more helpful. I wish more recipes did this! 😀
What a delightful person!!
Jenny your awesome 👍😀
Even with those teeth you are a stunna', and those eyes.... Thanks,doing this recipe sarvo.
Thank you 🙏 for sharing this wonderful  recipe video on making homemade dinner rolls 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽. Looks delicious and yummy 😋😋😋😋😋😋😋
Your kitchen looks so beautiful.👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
Always loved you Jenny ❤️
I love your videos but i have one question how high is your rack from the bottom flame or does is not make a difference. Once again love your videos and keep them coming :-)
I just made a batch, exactly as you described. Delicious! For cooking, as I've been learning to cook for several decades now, whether there are many steps or just a few, simplicity is supreme! It's so wonderful to find someone who understands simplicity in cooking and who does it with such evident joy! Thanks.
Does this work with gluten free flour?
GILF alert!!
I made these on Thanksgiving, Jenny you made me look like a rockstar to my family, fresh rolls with an entire Thanksgiving meal from scratch, love you love your channel!
I knew she looked familiar, Jenny Jones. The only parchment paper I could find is Reynolds and it say ‘good to 425deg? Guess I’ll keep the extinguisher handy?
That's one thing I like about you. What we can do with our meatloaf & are we happy with our buns!!! I 🤣😂🤣😂
You’re so dang funny!
Fellas, are you happy with your ladies' buns?
Yummy 😍💕 Jenny looks like my mom lol
Jenny is so cute and fun!
What is your trick for getting the sticky flour off your hands at the end?
it takes 35 minutes for the oven to heat up?!? that's not normal
I love your bread recipes Ms Jen and your sense of humor thanks for sharing this. I’m sure I will do this tonight .
A complete  Antithesis to Martha Stewart. Refreshing!!!😉👍
While cant like her. Her kitchen looks like normal Anerican kitchens. She uses cheap plastic utensils and a pink pig timmer.
Super recipe  will try   thank you so much  looks really wonderful
Have you ever made pizza dough with this recipe?
You are so cute, Jenny. Love your pigtail hair, your smile...
Need to get out more lady and smell the roses your so excitable it's not good for your Heath.
how hot the water has to be? luke, warm,  hot.Nice recipe.
Hey Jenny...can you get the same results if you use Whole Wheat flour?
My dream kitchen!  My dream buns!😄❤️
She Awesome!!!!! 😘✌️
your beautiful jenny
Love the recipe and it  seems easy, And will give a try. Thank you.
Hey Jenny, Are you married and do you bake oatmeal raisin cookies. Ha ha ha. I love your recipes. Thanks for helping people understand the importance and simplicity of prparing and cooking out own food. From the garden too.
I used to watch your talk show now I watch your channel.
Are you happy with your buns...hilarious..made my day..
Thanks for this great recipe. I tried it and .......IT WORKED!!! 😉
You  a real good person to listen to and good teacher thank you  i will try to make it too
not good but you are very cute lady
Just found these recipes and so far each one I've tried has been amazing!  We decided to do these rolls today so my 4 and 6 year old could help and they had so much fun.  I had to leave the light on in the oven while they were cooking they were so excited and did these rolls deliver.  Husband, kids and myself loved them!  Thank you so much for sharing your recipes, making them so easy and your videos are fantastic.
I can't believe I didn't find her channel sooner!
I like learning the difference between the warm and cold water amazing
I just love your Videos , you make everything easy and fun.
Please add Celsius temperatures as well in your video: you have an international audience!! :-)
Hi Jenny, your old secretary at the show, Susan Hall, here. I LOVED watching this video! You're so happy cooking. How lovely. I'm making these for my mom, who I caretake now. I can't wait! Thanks for a fun and easy to understand recipe and demonstration. Hope you're happy and well, my friend.
Oh, Jenny lol you silly goose
I can see why she has such a big following.  She is delightful.
There is something wrong with an oven that takes 35 min to heat to 450 degrees. Mine takes at the most 10 minutes.
More than a "loose" dough--more like diarhhetic. I had to add a ton of flour to get it to the point where I could form rolls, so of course, the rolls came out rather tough and a real workout for the teeth. Oh well, I really prefer to make whole grain breads anyway....
Doesn’t hot water kill the yeast?
Really it's a great recipe. ❤️
can they bring back. your show I miss it dearly
Hi, can you make the rolls with a vienna sausage or something inside? I would love to try but don't want to spoil it.
I think the bread rolls are even better than the bread loaf I made because you can freeze them and take out what you need - no rush.  I actually went thru the entire bread loaf myself in 3 days.  I’m going to try this recipe for sure!
Great video Jenny, thanks.
I love how genuinely excited she is with the finished product. Also, I wholeheartedly agree with the types of special occasions to make this for. I, for one, definitely deserve this after finishing my laundry. LOL
piggy made me laugh ,,shes great!
Love your humor. Made my day
my oven takes  5 minuets
Yummmmm. You are so cute and fun, Jenny. 😊
Hi  It's best I was searching like this but I don't have oven also So can u let me know how to bake it then🤔 plz
I hope they're as good as they look.. I am making them for  Christmas dinner today.. I made my dough an hour ago. I ❤ crusty bread.  It's so great to have a recipe with items I already had.  It's been a rough Christmas financially for my family, no presents this year and no turkey or traditional holiday dinner.. I have a whole  chicken and frozen veggies.  This recipe is exactly what I needed in order to transform it into a Christmas dinner.. Now it feels like Christmas. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.. I can't wait to see how the rolls turn out.   Merry Christmas and happy holidays to everyone. ❤
I'm not happy with my buns! I simply don't understand. Exact duplicate measurements, but when I add the 1 1/4 cup of water, the dough is still very dry. More like a pastry dough for apple pie but still needing more moisture. I had to add an additional cup of hot water and it's still lumpy. What am I doing wrong?
Great vid. Love your fun
What a clown, she makes ya laugh.
can't wait to make mine but that smile lololol even in my saddest moment lol ty J
I see this theme a lot in her vids. What’s wrong with kneading? It’s great exercise and helps to keep your fingers strong and nimble. It also provides much more control over the baking process and the end result.
can i use whole wheat flour?
I like that she's happy with her buns.
I just love your videos! Love the kitchen and color choices and so easy to follow your directions! Thank you so much!!
You are one of my favorite people lol loved the ending.
I find Americans annoying and they talk too much and don't  get anywhere ..but not Jenny she is instantly likeable nice accent . she is a bit of a babe in fact . kind of get drawn to her .  recipes are good also
450 F is 232 C
I feel so empowered to be able to make these lovely crusty, doughy centered rolls!
You made me hungry.
Luv ya Jenny!  Your recipes are wonderful. Trying the rolls today!
A little sugar in the mix and that is the bread rolls my momma used to make for the holidays.   Great with honey ham slices and a little spicy mustard.  Yuuuup
darling tap water has industrial waste in it im sure you dont want to use that. Thank YOU!!! i made my first loaf of bread the other day and im a male LOL!!!
subscribed!
Great rolls, and a great smile!  :)
Thank you.
A charming and enthusiastic teacher.
So sorry to say that mine did not even get close with your dough.  I used Bob's Red Mill unbleached white all purpose flour.
She definitely is a serious cook, I can tell by that commercial gas oven and cook top -and she likes bright, colorful pretty things.  But she didn’t have to mock my poor dental hygiene, that’s going to far.
What kind of paper you use?
Jenny can cook is so cool
Jenny I love watching you. You make me laugh EVERY SHOW and I learn how to cook and bake like I did with my mom. I’m polish but don’t speak it.💜🙋‍♀️☃️🎄
Jenny you are awesome. Watch you a lot...
Hi Jenny,  Recipes are  available from various you tubers. What makes you special is your presentation skills, to the point dialog delivery, no long talks and a great sense of humor. That is why I subscribe to your channel.
Can we use mixer?
<3 thanks make it for christmas
I stumbled across your videos. Keep up the great work. I made your no knead crusty rolls but only cut the batter in half and made two crusty rolls giving them 3 extra minutes in the oven. Using them for meatball sandwiches. MM good.
Thank you!!
Thank you!🙏🙏
You are awesome and I like your smile and the recipe!
I think I've found the female equivalent of chef John!!
Thank you Jenny, I will bake these at our next BBQ!  One question: If I wanted to make them a bit smaller like dinner-roll sized, say making 10-12 buns out of this batch, would I then need to reduce the baking time?
@Jenny Can Cook  Do you have any gluten free bread recipes? My roommate has Celiac and misses tasty, high quality bread. Most of her gluten free bread from the store not only is expensive, it's very sweet (due to all the rice flour that companies use), and tends to be harder and denser.  I'd love to make homemade, tasty gluten free bread for her. Also, get daughter has a soy allergy. Which soy is in most prepackaged breads too (along with everything else), making grocery shopping for my household a real challenge (and an expensive one at that).  Would you be willing to develop any of your recipes to be gluten free/soy free? 🙏🏽  By the way, I used to watch your talk show all the time back in the 90s. So happy to have found you again on YouTube! Love that your sense of humor has remained. Keep up the fantastic content, we all love you 💖
You are simply gorgeous with a great energy  Thank you
I like your sense of humour 👍🏼.  I love how simple thing are.... thank for sharing
Wonder if the table cloth melted under that pan lol
How in the hell do you get the cling wrap to cooperate like that?
I've never seen you before, but I love your tutorials! Thank you ! Now i can make bread n rolls!
I made the rolls for dinner tonight!  What a huge success.   I brushed some butter on top and put shredded cheddar in about half of them.  I could have made an entire meal out of just the rolls.  Thanks for making the great video.  You're the best.
I loved the video.  But I think I may have waisted 2.5 cups of Organic All-Purpose Flour.  I followed the recipe but after adding the 1 and 1/4 cup hot water my flour wouldn't combine properly.  The flour was still dry and loose in much of the bowl.  So I added one extra cup of hot water.  It looks a little lumpy but at least the mix is combined.  Now I wait the three hours.  Any advise would be appreciated.
can you just be any cuter?!?!?!?
are you happy with your buns?  Hahaha!!
Jenny your crazy, but we love you.♥️
Wow, your smile is gorgeous! 😉
So funny (the last smile)! Thank you for sharing
You're a hoot!
Help..... Electric fan assisted over.  Please give me instructions xx
Trying to recognize where I have seen her before
Great video
This is the kind of joy one gets from cooking that you just don't see on most shows.
How many mins.
love you Jenny
You are such a joy to watch and learn from....loved the teeth
Your recipes and videos are the best!
Thank you so much that was fantastic I didn’t know it was that easy. Merry Christmas to you. 🎄
Looks great
what went wrong rolls very hard
You're awesome. My daughter got me into you. I used to bake no knead bread and now I'm going to give it another shot.
I love Jenny’s smile at the end so funny❤️
Wish you could come back to doing videos....LOVE all your recipes!
You have to have very good teeth for her baking products.  See what happened on 6:08.
Lol, that opening line
She is so cute
I really like these easy recipes and you are a very beautiful woman also with great presentation
Jenny Jones! Omg I knew she looked and sounded familiar!
WHAT A SWEET LADY,THANKS JENNY
Those look amazing. Gonna try it. Thank you.
I do have a Dutch oven, can you use iron in the oven without it hurting the iron?
What a beautiful lady.....❤❤❤❤❤.....her face is full of joy and love....!!!.....🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄
“Are you happy with your buns?” Lmao
lol I love how excited she is about bread. I freakin love bread
i dont have baking sheet..can i bake it without a baking sheet
I bought a dutch oven pot at Aldi and now on to your recepie  to bake bread
You such a goofball😀
100 %  Gluten free,  ie:  no extra charge....
Ha! Ha! Such a nice happy lady and her instructions were so easy to follow.
OMG she's back!!!
❤ Sub'd 😄
I want your kitchen. Very nice.
Fantastic buns great video well done
Ha ha. The joy on the lady’s face. Reminded me of Audrey Hepburn.
nice recipe' thanks for sharing'Jenny
Thanks Jenny, your recipes are easy and amazing...
Oh, Jenny.... I made these.  The tough was not loose like yours to begin the rise, it was a little stiff, almost dry.  The rise was about 1/4, still not loose.  Shaped the rolls, they appeared rather small and didn’t rise while waiting for the oven to heat. I alway use a oven thermometer to be sure to get a good temp. Baked for 20 minutes.  Looked pretty but crust was very hard, no increase in size and bottom 1/2s were not fully cooked. Maybe it was the weather, rainy and a bit cool?  I will keep trying to get this right. First time out was not good 😔😔😔
Love your presentation. Got me excited I’m going to start making bread now.My wife has celiac. Can you make this recipe with gluten-free flour
I know you say use "Hot Water" but do you have any idea how many people will go overboard and kill the yeast?  How about luke warm water?
This is awesome. I’m going to try these!!! Thanks Jenny.
New to making breads   I love doing it and it was to explain the differences between aerating and shifting flours. So thank you so much
I remember her on TV shows. Sweet personality
Putting the dough on a warm oven for 1 hour (NOT 3 hours as stated)  and they come out perfect every time.  Added dill for a great, savory biscuit !!!
We made these rolls and they were great.   Thank you Jenny 😃
Do you shift your or use as is from the containr
I didn't see a ring on her finger wonder if she's married if she is he's a lucky man
LoL, I love bread too much.. makes ya gain weight. How have you maintained your weight over the years.. does your website have meal plans?
Awesome lady and awesome recipes, of which I have made many of them. I have a loaf of artisan bread in the oven now, ready in about 10. Go Jenny
I have made Jenny's bread recipe twice this wee. It's fabulous!
Have read a few comments and I am truly appalled!.... can't find comments of what people think of the recipe !! This is about rolls people.....  WTF, what is wrong with this freaking society? Instead of commenting on the outcome (is it worth making?) most talk about nonsense! Unbelievable psychos
Ohh your so lovely to watch. You make me smile and want to get into my kitchen to copy what you have made. Really miss your videos. I understand why you stopped making these them but you are missed by so many folks I'm sure. Anyway thanks for all these beautifully made cooking videos. Your a real darling x
Thank you Jenny! Making these to go with my roast duck this Thanksgiving! Hope you are enjoying a blessed Thanksgiving where ever you are 😘🙏🏼
N
One-room efficiency apartment and I made The rolls today and they are fantastic thank you so much
WE LOVE YOUR SHOW
I wonder if it would work with whole-wheat flour?
I'm new here babe, I'm loving your energy and friendly.  Thank you. But dang I'm hungry now for rolls.lol
thank you for your most easy way to make bread you are wonderful from Cairo Egypt i send you my greeting
OK! You are delightful. I have never heard of you but it's like watching myself 30 years ago making my first yeast bread. I was so excited and happy when it turned out good. We owned a country inn in upstate NY and I would make 58 small loaves every day. I was always excited when they came out of the oven. Anyway, thank you for a few minutes of complete joy.
I'm inspired to make bread! Jenny makes it seem so easy, and so much fun. Roll on bread rolls!! R.
I love how excited you get about beautiful bread.  Well done!
30 minutes for the oven to heat up? How come??????? That's too long.
I still need you to come over.  You will be always welcome 🙏
Omg I'm so going to try this!! You are a joy to watch...ty!!!
I tried making a different type of bread and I thought I had failed so I was about to throw it away but I heard this video come on and I got distracted and I went to see the video and I thought "hey that sounds like my "bread" so I'm going to sleep now but tommorow I'm going to try it
Lady you Quack me up/

Hi Jenny, my buns are a little on the small side & didn’t look risen at any stage! I was going to send a photo but can’t see how. They taste good though. I used easy bake yeast and hot water from a boiled kettle 10 minutes before.  Was the water too hot do you think? What exact temperature should it be? I am enjoying your videos  Holly ❤️
You are so fun,.. Loved your Show, Love you,...
Jenny. You are a very very cute and sweet beautiful lady. You are adorable and admirable.💖💖💖BLESSINGS ALWAYS. 🙏🙏🙏
Lovely video. Love your enthusiasm.
Ok, but how cute is she 💜
With sme donut shop coffee😁

She is so funny! I love her! ♥️
I love your no kneed bread, i’m going to try these this weekend

My sister loves these rolls!  You can use Whole Wheat and Almond Flour mixed, too!
Jenny,  I just love your Energy and your Cooking.
I just saw 2 videos how to make bread and can trait to try your recipes love the way you make things look so simple and love your enthusiasm
Beautiful!well done! Thank you!

😂 Happy with my buns you are so funny love it and I love the way you cook👍
Shared on Facebook
Been watching u for awhile, love your recipes, and your personality, what a wonderful colorful fun person to watch 💖
Man I would love to hang out in her kitchen. She's adorable 😂 and hilarious
We need more of Jenny's recipes!
Hmmm mine turned out nice on crust but wet and gummy on the inside. Where did I go wrong? Ty
5/5 recipe. Thank you so much for sharing Jenny! I’ve made these twice now, I have been wanting to making my own bread for a long time. I made the bread with organic wholemeal soft spelt flour, the first time with organic fresh yeast (I increased the yeast quantity) and also with organic dry active yeast the next time - both times my bread came out lovely! ❤️
I can't wait to get my kids to make these. Thanks for the video
Are you happy with your buns lol
question for Jenny, Can we double the recipe and make 16 rolls instead of just 8 ?
There goes my Keto diet.
Just come out of retirement and be Jenny again, love your cooking style
Yo is this that chick from the meme??!?
.
Nice buns!
People have to have told you that you remind them of June Lockhart, right? Timmy's mom on Lassie and she also played the mom on Lost in Space? You have the same voice and demeanor as well. Nice ladies, both.
You are soooo sweet ❤️
Why use plastic? I cover the bowl with a damp tea towel.
Jenny you are the best...I baked me some Crusty Rolls and they came out perfect. Thank you so much for recipe. I love your videos. The best ever!!
Bwahaha
Love your bread series...Jen....
She cooks with a big smile. It makes it even tastier.
My gosh I adore your video's!
❤️
If I was married to Jenny, I'd be pulling rolls out of the oven on a regular basis!
You're a silly person, Jenny, but you're very persuasive. :-)
I can’t wait to try these. Your bread is awesome!
Jenny, I'm so enjoying yiur videos! It's making me get back in the kitchn and cook some home made meals. Your recipes are easy to do and fast. Looking forward to watching many more!
Does anyone know if Jenny Can Cook will have any future anything here? I've missed Jenny's videos so much...wondered at times if she is ok....it's disheartening to think of the one who makes things so enjoyable...coming here maybe having difficulties.. ...watching the tutorial.. seeing and being amidst the joy of what is being made... I miss this...and have for a longggg time... a little sadness inside actually... :(  Jenny if anyone shares posts with you....missing everything about you and this channel...it has been pure joy... A Happy place...  :)
This is an incredibly easy recipe to make and the results are just as good!! TY for the great recipe
I loved your talk show and your cooking is fabulous. Your sense of humour is right up my alley. Great job Jenny👌
3:29 " Whatever it takes to get it into a round shape "   U said it, lady
" Are you happy with YOUR buns? "  * Touches own booty *
Hi, I really liked your recipe.  I do have a question though.  If I wanted to make them into dinner rolls, how much sugar should I add?
Not so much, but my hubby is happy with them, ;0).
From Failure to Fantastic!  I made about 8 batches within the last two weeks (when I first started making these). Here is what I learned.  1) Do not use a whole packet of yeast. The whole packet is way too much yeast. You need to use only 1/4 tsp of the packet. The whole packet is 2 & 1/4 tsp of yeast. I did this on accident and my bread was super bland.  2) Weight measure your flour! (320g) This part is important, especially if you don't aerate your flour. I was just cup measuring straight from the bag. My buns came out, decent, but maybe too dense. Once I started weight measuring, these came out perfect. Fluffy deliciousness that was not overly dense. Perfect. I had a kitchen scale the whole time, why didn't I think of this sooner!  Also, I have typically been using the overnight method vs the 3 hour method. I'm trying the 3 hour method now to see the results now that I weight measure. Fingers crossed!  I also did one batch as two logs (kinda like baguettes) instead of 8 rolls and yum. They came out perfect too!
Jenny, you are so funny. I bet you if you had this show in the 90s you would have really made it. I didn't like the Jenny Jones Show too much cuz it was a little nasty but I think you're a wonderful cook.
will the time be cut down if i have a dough prover?
THANKS YOU 💯 G,OODNESS 🌟😁.♥️🖤💚 BROWN FAMILY DAPHNE COTTON ALWAYS 💜 AWESOME🦋 WOW
Great recipe ! Can’t wait to try this !
No it did not work for me 😕
Thank you jenny for sharing your yummy recipe. God bless your heart 💞 love from Philippines 🇵🇭
I got a pig timer just like Jenny.  Got it for my Mom.  See has been dead for 9 years this month
making this now huhuhuhu
🤣😂🤣😂 love that ending!!!
Love how ur recipes r so good and easy
I love your bread and why not your smile too
I added 1 1/4 cups of water, and the dough is much thicker than shown.
Dear Jenny, is there a way to make this no knead crust rolls with whole wheat flour?
“I love bread!!”  -Oprah
Lol love your buns and I love your jokes.
I can't wait to try these.  You make it look easy sprinkled with humor.
That was so funny 😆.
Bless you 😇 Jenny
Pleeeease.....could you give the temperature in Celsius as well? That would be a tremendous help!
Thank you, they look amazing !!!  Can’t wait to make them too. Pinning.
Wow 👍⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
I remember her from the early 90's, she hasn't aged a bit
they are beautiful, i can smell them
Jenny, I made the chocolate cake now for the 2nd time and its amazing, sooo simple, my sister and I can not get enough of it, thank you sooo much looking forward to more recepies
Hi happy Jenny... lol... I have been watching so many of your vidioclips here... I  just like to say, it is fun watching you performing, nice smile, nice voice, nice hands,  and right you are, so many recepes are easy ... hmm lecker we say in germany....  thx 4 sharing all your lecker lecker vidios... regards f. Germany
Love the work,  love the presentation.
Madam I m frm lndia  Your work is very clean  You are active and hardworking  I like your videos
A complete failure!! 😭
Your clear instructions coupled with visuals made the whole experience so transparent and a breeze. I can now say I can bake bread! :)  Thank you.
You are adorable..I made the bread no knead and it was the best ever..I aded half tsp of sugar and little of olive oil though 😁.. Thank u for the video!
they come out well in my 300 degree electric oven too!
MONGO LOVES BREAD>>>>>
She used too much flour during her shaping, which made that big mouse hole we see in the one she cut open.  Don't use much flour during shaping.  It causes large gaping tunnels through the bread.  You just need a very light dusting.  Good recipe though.
Who’d of thunk it, the recipe worked perfectly all the way down under, here in Australia and I’ll give you a tip.   We used half the leftover dough for pizza and it turned out fantastic.   Keep up the good work Jenny 😜
Don't use hot water out of the tap to drink or cook.  It comes from the inside of your hot water heater.  Do a youtube search on what a hot water heater looks like on the inside.
Love these rolls!!
I am trying to follow your instructions. I am not great in the kitchen. I have very carefully measured the 2  1/2 cups of flour, yeast, and salt. When I added the 1 1/4 cup of water, it looked a lot drier than yours. What did I do wrong?
This is the newest video from you I can find and it’s 4 years old. Your recipes are great. You should start posting again. Doesn’t look like you ever read or like your comments. Hmmmmm🙂🙂🙂🙂😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐
You have inspired me to bake bread. I have always resisted, but you make it so easy!!!
Thanks for sharing this nice recipe, it looks so yummy and I want to try it but can you please turn the ingredients into grams? Thank you in advance.
Mine didn't change at all.  After 3 hours it looked just the same as when I put it in the bowl!!  No bubbles and still as stodgy.  They remained the same size as when I put them in the oven - didn't rise at all.  What didn't I do?  Obviously it's me because all the other comments are positive.  I tried some years ago and they ended up like rock cakes!
Where do you get your aprons? They are so cute.
I am looking forward to trying this recipe. My husband is on a renal diet. Low/no sodium. I know the recipe calls for 1 teaspoon of salt, but I I’ll try with half teaspoon. Not sure how it would taste with no salt.
Jenny! Those rolls lools so yummy! Thank you for sharing. I will make em today for my family :)
Jenny you crack me up!  Rolls look great!
I love crusty bread 😘🇬🇧👍
💕❤️💕
I love your face, love your explain☺🌹Actually this recipe is Iranian bread, we call this bread, Barbary, it's so delicious just with one more option, before put in oven that make it crispy more with a one teaspoon flour and half a cup water, mix it together, after that It needs a little heat to make it look like honey, now brush it on each piece of your bread👏🌹🍃
You are wonderful I love you.
Darlin,if you had ever seen the inside of a water heater you would NEVER use hot tap water to cook with again....
I'm sure to make these 8 buns only cost the price of 2 at the market. I buy them because I love crusty buns. Will this work for a baguette as well?
Made these. OMG THE BEST BUN EVER! EVER! I thought I’d died and gone to heaven...
Yummy 😋 they  looks so Delicious! Thank you 💕
lovely lady thanks for the great recepie 😊 great video👍👍
“Are you happy with your buns?”😂🤣🤣
You are so cute Jenny.  Such a nice smile too.  😁
Oh my god you are wonderful
Jenny, love this video...can't wait to try these rolls.. they look so delicious AND easy. Where can I find a scraper like yours? I have searched in vain.....I have a stainless one, but I think I like the flexibility of the plastic scraper. Thank you for all your inspiration....( and humor! )
You make me wanna bake again
o kay?
I love your recipes Jenny.  You've inspired me to give away my bread machine! (Which is the only way I had made bread in the past.). You're loaf recipe comes out perfect so today I'm trying the rolls.  Thank you for sharing :)
🌸👏👍🍁🙌🍀🌼🌹😃😀💃
Garlic butter with parsley on top sounds good.
You make these seem very easy...can’t wait to try your recipes
why cant you leave thm to cool like an adult?
Jenny, I love your instructions! Unfortunately I don't have an oven in my new house, but only a solar cooker which heats up to 150 deg C...
Nice teeth. Wanna go out?
Your way of explaining every thing works so good for me. ❤❤❤❤❤
She is so sexy funny aside from cooking she Austin Powell's version of American funnies
Aw you seem like such a sweet and fun women to be around
Thanks
Jenny I love your "No Knead Crusty Rolls" I was wondering if I could add sour cream to give them a sourdough taste. Can I do that? Can you let me know how much to add if I need to change the amount of flour? Love you and your recipes. Thank you Jenny!
Yes! Lovely smile! :)
You are such a refreshing personality and of course a good cook
Imma call you mom... Thank you mom
This ladys great
Oh oh.... Not so good for my teeth... Wait for it....
Jenny, I absolutely love your buns!
Try throwing a few ice cubes in the oven while they cook...
Good Morning .I love all your videos .
Pan de sal!
Hi,Jenny, greetings from Zimbabwe.  U are such a fun person to watch, I absolutely  Love watching u . Your recipes  are so easy and scrumptious.  Keep it up God Bless
I like the way she is excited about these stuff :))))
👀🙄😳😄
Looks delicious!
Yaaaay!! A bread without added sugar!! Perfect! Thanks👍😉
Hi Jenny , I hope you have new videos I can't find you, but I can almost smell these rolls
I just made these for the first time today and was a bit skeptical about them tasting good with such simple ingredients. My husband and I love them! Thanks Jenny. This will be a recipe I will use often. I’m going to freeze some for when Company comes too.  I really enjoy your videos!
OMG you look like June Lockhart's Twin! You know. The mom in Lost in space!
For some reason she reminds me of that one episode in black mirror
Genius! We are a vegan family and these rolls are BRILLIANT! ( We LOVE your chocolate cake, too) Now, how about some vegan pierogie dough. Panie, please. Thank you.( 8 years of Polish school and I still can't spell.)
How can i get the recepie please? In written ? Lots of Blessings from Germany
Too much P.L.A.S.T.I.C.S!!!!! Zhezhezhezhe
how do you do a double batch
I love my buns!!!!!
Love your videos and presentations but please learn how to shape dough properly as you are teaching to a wide audience..
Nice. I love bread also.
I tried your no knead bread recipe and followed instructions. I discovered the 3 cups flour to 1 1/2 cup hot water did not leave my mixture looking like yours. Mine was alot dryer and not as wet as yours.. Had to add an additional half cup of water. Any suggestions.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Omg. You are sooo genuine and so adorable. Love your personality.
I want some.
I made the no knead bread and it was AMAZING.  Thanks for sharing these.  I've been making bread for at least 30 yrs and I never used a dutch oven....it was totally the missing link.  I can't believe that crust is so easy to achieve.
looks yummy......been with my husband 36yrs n his always nags about making bread ...but I'm always petrified as it will flop n not b good ...so hey quess Wat these were so easy to make n so yummy I'm gonna surprise him ...thanks lovey
your the best Jenny! 😍
Thank you for sharing 😋
Great video!
Hi can we make this with whole wheat flour please?
Great vid n funny. T.y. love ur smile

Пожалуйста напишите ингредиенты на русском, благодарю!
Yummy 😋
You are the best. Love the pigtails. Best rolls ever.
Can we just talk about how cute she is especially when the rolls were ready
Jenny can cook sala
Simply you are amazing. Thanks
May I ask  why no oils?
This is the first time I've successfully baked bread, all thanks to this video
Hey lets see more videos
Too much flour
Love her videos, very inspirational
Hi mam u are too good made very easy to make hard rolls excellent 👌
Jenny don't wear bright yellow it it distracts from what your doing.
I just found this recipe & made it tonight, so thrilled! They're perfect!! Thankyou so much Jenny!! ❤❤
Jenny you should not say hot water hot water mean boiling water u should say room temperature  or  tap water 💧
Jenny I'm a Merchant Marine Captain off the Coast of West Africa and pretty much starving for American food and entertainment. Love the show but really like the derogatory remarks on whom ever pissed you off that day. I will keep watching for the spice.
my favorite breakfast in the morning
Jenny is the best!  She makes it look easy, and really it is!  I’ve been making her recipes all week long!  Yes, getting a tad heavier!  Keep on entertaining us Jenny!
She is great
One of my new favorite YouTube channels lol. I love your sense of humor! Lol
Will the use of the cold water the Day before still make the Yeast rise into the Dough.? Thanks for sharing & I subscribe also etc.
Question Jenny,? Does not the Active  Dry Yeast, Must be Poofed in warm Water first,? Or can it just be put in to the Dry Flour etc.?
Is hot water will kill the yeast?
Love this!!!
#JennyCanCook ; You are the absolute best ! Thank you so much ! And no ... I'm not particularly happy with my buns 😂 Oh ... And you'd be surprised as to what I manage to mess up ! 😏
Well I just finished mt attempt to make these here rolls, but they didn't rise very good and they wound up looking more like Ellie May Clampet's biscuits than your awesome rolls, maybe mt tapwater wuz too hot?
Now those are some lovely dentures
Who are you?!  I know your face and voice, but from where?
plz give ingredients below the description
Thanks jen...!
This is my 100x watching you....and I already made this many many times...it’s called  pandesal  in my country Philippines...it was the original pan we love to eat in the morning...but now their adding sugar,butter and milk...but I still love the old ways.
Too funny!
Dear sister Many thanks for enabling me to make it at home Pakistan. Your presentation is marvelous.
I love you 😍😍😍 thanks you very good 👍  OK 😘😘😘😘
I like your crazy sense of humor Jenny :-)
I love your enthusiasm!
Im glad i found your vlog...you make cooking seem so easy. And you're funny. 😊
your too funny....cute piggy and gonna try this bread roll too. thanks!!!!
These look amazing. On your recipe you say to areate the flour, do you mean sift when you are making the recipe? And how do you store these rolls to keep crunchy and not go soft? Thank you for your video and recipe.
The center always comes out very dense   never light...any ideas , Central Texas
Thank you. I'm trying to learn to make bread. Appreciate your hard work
Jenny, you are an inspiration to anyone who loves homemade bread and is interested in learning the easiest way to bake a loaf in the oven at home.  I have become, literally, a baker overnight and just cannot quit! Thank you.
Never change Ma'am.
LOVE the enthusiasm! Your zest and joy for living to the fullest is inspiring! Thank you!
I love your Videos, Thanks.
I love watching your videos. Have that kind humor ❤so cute. Reminds me of my grandma
😂❤️
So very hot water does not kill the yeast.
Oh dear my rolls didn’t turn out good, very hard and doughy inside, I wonder if it could be the flour, I used a strong bread flour, made the loaf yesterday using the same flour, it turned out sort if ok, again a bit doughy, any thoughts bakers. 🍞🍞🍞🍞🍞
Thanks for your time and Good blessed You.
Miss you Jenny!  Pray you and your family are doing well.  ❤️❤️❤️
Thank You.cruty Roll.wonder.full.your.kitche.beuty.full.and.clourful"l.
She's so sweet. I like to bake bread a lot. I think I'm going to give this a try.
I made your Dutch Oven bread recipe and it was delicious.  Now I'll be making these!  Thanks, Jenny!
Thank You! It’s Taste Like My Favorite Pandesal. Yummy for My Coffee!!!
Just love her🤗🤗🤗🥰
These are as good as they get.  Thank you Jenny
They look delicious, but I was wondering if there is a way to make them where they would be  softer on outside and not as crunchy?
the moment you realize you made six buns...... shit. Well here goes to baking and hoping I still nailed it. My first bread baking boi attempt
Why was the crust so hard? The temp went from 149F to 152 F help. Thanks  Jerry has
You are so sweet.
Can these be made with gluten free flour
I love your cooking videos. You are such a nice person. Keep up the good works❤
U r so good sister, love your work
You make me happy and motivated, I love watching your videos
That recipe is wrong, it takes 3 cups of flour not 2.5??????
I wonder how the yeast is not affected in spite of the hot water!
Thank you for explaining the difference in using cold water versus hot water.
love the way they look like ... you did them in the italian way ;)
Great smile and spirit
Jenny I so enjoy watching you.  Thank you for all you do for all of us..
Jenny I love your hair  You look so sweet....  Nice bread I will try this ....
❤️❤️❤️
Your nuts totally nuts but in a good way lol! I love it! Will try these rolls they look lovely .
I just spread a butter and dip it on my coffee.
WOW, Only 3 Ingredients plus water. 😍👍👍👍
Jenny can cook, for real.  I really wish she was still making cooking videos.   One of the best on youtube! !
Where can I buy a wooden board like the one you use? Thank you.
I like this lady . I just came across her channel 😊😊😊😊
You are a lovely colourful teacher and a joy to watch!!  Thanks for sharing videos!!😍😍 One request....will it be possible to mention ingredients?
are you happy with your buns ?...  Helll yeah
Jeeeeeez the teeth at the end....smh.  Great vid otherwise
700+ more snowflakes in here too, 😂😂😂🤪🤪🤪
Jenny, Weren't you on TV a while ago? I'm a guy. I love your simple recipes. Just made the rolls...wish me luck.
I love the way you show us easy to the point thanks
Love you Jenny
You give me inspiration. Thank you.
Love love love your videos. I can't wait to try you bread/rolls for myself.
Whoever married this lady is the luckiest person on the planet
how bout hot cross buns
Great idea, tried them. Word of warning, don't just proof for the amount of time it takes for your oven to get up to 450. Hers takes 35 mins but ours takes about 10 mins which is not long enough. 35 mins is a long time for an oven to reach 450! So be sure to let them rest at least half an hour regardless of how long it takes your oven to reach 450.
❤❤
Im so glad I stumbled on to your channel, which you the best
Love the smile! Thanks for sharing, definitely going to give these rolls a try! ~Bob~
Ohh I just loved your recipe! U are a nice and lovely lady. Many thanks, I'll try
Jenny is a crack-up.  Good times.  ;)
Love your presentation! You’re so cute and funny! Can’t wait to try these!
You are an amazing person and really beautiful 👏👍
Could I divide them to make 4 larger rolls? Would I need to adjust the temperature or anything?
I remember seeing you on TV!! Wow! Glad you are well & I'm loving the recipes. Thx!
I've only seen a couple of the recipes but you are expeditious and precise and with a little more flair LOS grandiose I osity you would be Martha Stewart.
that bread looks great but those teeth
We love these rolls!!!  Thanks so much for sharing 👍
You are a very good teacher and I love to learn baking
Jenny your recipes are foolproof and you make it look fun and effortless . Thanks for sharing .
Thanks Jenny, boy, oh boy am I going to have fun with these buns. I am a single male & after watching your video about making bread in a Dutch oven,  I went out & bought a New Larger Bench-top oven which will take the Thrift Shop $5 Dutch oven container. Has anyone ever told you Jenny "you've got lovely buns"?  Sorry, couldn't help that one, lol.
Jenny I've made these rolls 3 times this week...I love them💕
Not enough holes inside! Look massive. No not for me!!
You are so adorable!! <3 Love your videos.
As we speak (as I write), my first batch of home made bread is in the oven.
Has anyone used wheat flour?
Dosent the yeast dienoff when hot water is used??
These are delicious!  Have been baking over 50 years and this is the easiest recipe.  This is very similar to rolls we used to buy at a bakery in my childhood.  I used sesame seed on some and kosher  salt on a few.  Thanks so much!  And I love how you make things so simple to follow!
Hi Jenny, I tried it and loved it. Thank you for sharing
450 what?? Centigrades
Jenny followed exactly and my dough wasn't sticky
I loved watching your talk show but now i love watching you cook you are so funny 😂
looks like you're in Canada! Are you?
thank you Jenny  it is quite delicious and easy .
Is it possible to cut this recipe in half? I’m single and don’t have much room in the freezer. It would end up going to waste.
Love crusty bread!
Thank you Jenny, they look delicious!
I wish you would make more videos. We miss you.
As I was watching this video, I kept saying how much you looked like, Jenny Jones, the talk-show lady. Now, I know why. It is! Love this roll recipe, and will use my sourdough starter. Thank you
I' Love her vedio's. We wish she was our neighbor. 😂
(
really love this chef because she makes things so simple and quick. well done
Oh my I just found this crusty roll recipe and can't wait to try it, and I did send it to ALL my family members.  This is also something that KIDS can make as a learning project on a SNOWY DAY....So easy...I always have yeast in my cupboards, and of course don't you know it, I do not have any yeast......Crying!!!
I made this yesterday l am glad l check the oven , the parchment paper can only withstand 400 degrees.  You said put the oven on 450 and my paper almost started a fire. It was not wax paper. Parchment.  Plus it shouldn't take  35 min. To heat up a oven?  It also takes 2 cups of h20
Oh Jenny Jones. Glad to see her back.
I feel like I know her from television.
How lovely your  kitchen is :) keep it up your recipe's ... we re all following you!
Please come back
Jenny where did you get your board for working with your dough? thank you
Love the jokey teeth! Those rolls look crazy good! I love bread, it’s my weakness. I’m definitely going to make these!
Too cute...T Y..
I am trying this now, and my dough does not look as water as yours, and I followed your instructions. mine seems drier at 1 1/4 cups of water.
Delicious
I was an idiot.  Somehow when I got to the part where you add water I put in double the amount (2 1/2 cups).  I immediately realized my mistake.  So I added another teaspoon of salt and 1/4th teaspoon of yeast and mixed that in.  Then I added another 2 1/2 cups of flour.   I removed half, put it in a sealed container and put it in the freezer.  I covered the bowl with the remaining half and left it to sit all night (cold water method).  The next day I shaped the rolls as directed, covered them and left them on the counter.  I got distracted and they ended up sitting out for about two hours.  I then realized I had no parchment paper, so lightly greased the pan instead.  After all of that I baked them as directed and they came out great.  They may have been slightly softer on the bottom but were still great.  You can't kill these things no matter how much you screw up.  I'll find out later if I can successfully thaw my other batch and make them come out too.
I love bread!
Jenny I 💛 your channel!
This makes me hungry! Jenny will you do a video on how to make foccacia please!
If you added a pan of water under the buns would give a better crust?
Can I use whole wheat flour?
I love your videos and your smile at the end of this one is awesome!!!
I bought a Duch oven....but It just does not work.  The bread refuse to rise enough ..grrrrrr..!
LOL....what a cute little pig...!   I want to have one....LOL...!
You look familiar to me, were you ever able to actress, your voice even sounds familiar. I just can't place you. I love your easy recipes and your sense of humor🙂
I love your recepi and done many time, but sadly I find out my body can not handl the yest, so do you have a recipi for bread whitout yest?. Hi from danmark 🇩🇰 Tina
Hi!🌺 You are really good  Thank you, I like it too much when I see you so happy of your good result.
I made these and WOW...so good...ate 4 in a minute...lol.  Great easy recipe...thank you for sharing.
You never answered my question about my marriage proposal
I have to try these.  Thank you.
lol 2 seconds in .....
Funny lol
Jenny loved you on tv, love your cooking videos. Wish that was still on tv here. I thank you for sharing your recipes, as I use a lot of your recipes. You are such a beautiful, talented, smart, fun, person. God bless and hugs. Please keep sharing tips. Bet you have household or beauty tips too?
Great Video, I am going to make these. Thank You
Looks yummy!
You are lovely  and so full of enthusiasm!!Loved your recipe!!
Very nice thanks please coccoa bresd
Thank you! I will try this recipe! It looks delicious and easy. And I'm a sucker for easy. XD
Just a tip. Don't use hot water from the tap. Heat up cold water. Hot water goes in copper pipes, and that's not good for you. Over time it will build up in your body. Use cold water that you heat up. :)
Can this recipe be modified for a Keto diet?
Love how you get so excited!
Elec oven preheats fast.
You are so cute! I want you to come stay at my house and teach me. Ty for the lessons! I love watching you.
🤣🤣🤣👍😁
I get so excited over good bread too, giddy with anticipation,  honestly the simpliest things bring me joy  just like you.  Keep baking your crusty wonderful breads.
Jenny you really should start back making videos. Don’t worry about commenting back if you know that you made a thorough and comprehended easily video... these rolls are good. I made them tonight for dinner.
you put smile my face , question;;; no oil or egg  ?????   but going to give it a try!!!!!!!!!!!
Love Jenny jones
you are as much a treat as your bread rolls!
Beautiful recipe really nice and easy route to the point awesome nice job
Jenny, what am I doing wrong?  The crust is heavenly, but the inside is more elastic-like than fluffy.  Over-proofed?  Under-proofed?  Neither?  Followed the recipe exactly.  Many thanks, made your cinnamon rolls the other night and they were great!
Very very good recipe  I am going to try it
You make so many of us happy, Jenny.  I love all your recipes.  I think you have been graced with a charmed life.
😂 I like your smile 😃I have to try these!! So simple. I always thought bread was one thing I would never attempt because it looks too hard. But this recipe looks like a cinch!!
Love your scraper. Never even knew these existed.
Just love you Jenny.  Such a cute personality!!
In the first minutes i am watching the baking method but after i am watching and enjoying your laugh, your talking way , thank you for the video  , you are full of life and joy
Bread person - you and me babe :o)
Jenny rules! and she got me back into baking again. I can't knead due to rheumatoid arthritis and this is amazing! Thank you love X
the way it's looks,I can say it's so delicious!
The best way to relax is watching your videos and cooking ...  Your recipes are amazing...
I love Jenny
Thanks, Jenny.  Gonna try this.
If you put a small cup of water in the oven will it come out a little more of a crust?
i'm amazed!im literally feeling like..whoah! youre my favourite chef ever!even though im only 12 years old i have a dream to be just like you at this age.im Eunice.thats all i had to say.
I like people who are happy when doing something to eat!
Yummy!!! I print the recipe already, thank you so much!!! Have a great week!!! Be bless!!!
Love you excitement!! Like a kid in a candy shop.  I buy my crusty rolls and have always wanted to make them.. OMGOSH I will be doing this.. TY for sharing you enthusiasm and your recipe.
Jenny,  you rock!  I made the no-knead loaf in the dutch oven and my family loved it!  Now I'll make these.  Thanks for sharing these awesome recipes and making these fantastic videos!
Where did you get the scrapper you use I love it
Hilarious :))) High 5 for the teeth!
Like the end result of the bun, my question is-: can I bake the rolls in an air fryers?
Jenny jones. I loved this ladys show as a kid. Its a jenny jones Baker over. Lol . Im going to make these
you put the salt and yeast together??
You are precious! and a joy to watch. I cook and bake, and watching your matter-of-fact style is refreshing
I always get excited and so passionate about the smell of fresh bread too. My daughter always laughs at me.
Wow! These look great... I might make four bigger buns and use them as soup bowls... 😍
Such a sweet person Jenny
I tried and got a dry stodgy mix rather than a loose shaggy one. Can anyone clarify the weight of flour in grams? Cups is far too complicated for us English :)
I have not yet made this recipe, as I question the yeast measurement. 1/4 tsp is a very small quantity. I'm thinking it should be closer to 1/4 oz (1 pkt). Even the visual in this video appears to be a larger measurement. Some other posters having problems with their dough may be due to this 'error'. Comments?
I've made so many of Jenny's recipes and they were ALL great! I sure wish she'd make more videos!!
Love your channel❤️❤️❤️
I love bread but cannot eat it or I will become a blimp! I get my fix vicariously watching your videos.
Hey Jenny, I watched u once and that made me to subscribe you😊
Would be the same covering the dough initially with a dish towel instead plastic wrap?
Thank  darling you so great .
Your enthusiasm reminds me of phoebe Buffay
You have great experience with cooking, tasty (which ha as YouTube channel) should hire you 😊
Pq Facebook no coloca la traducción en español
Love it!! And she have goid sense. Of humour. 😂😂 love it
She is funny cute ☺
Dear Jenny n other friends I m baking a lot of flavoured breads n buns. Thanks to you all, garlic, peanuts, home made tomato sauce, chia seeds, crushed flax seeds, sesame seeds, raisins, etc I add to the dough. It all comes out well.
Aww Jen thank you so much for this unbelievably easy bread recipe. I also looove bread.
You’re humor is wonderful! Lol
I've been making the bread for a while and today I made the rolls. Great easy recipes..not to mention delicious!
I love Jenny's buns...
I love these baps esspecially with bacon on,also made some roll shape ones for hot dogs or sausages,delicious.
I love the recipes mostly and love the channel but seriously.......35 minutes to preheat your oven to 450?? My God....when I lived in the woods it took lees time with a wood stove.
Made it many times
Where did you get that large board, please?
Hi Jenny this recipe is fantastic!!! ... just I want to know where do you buy the wood board and what type of wood it is? Thanks
I love the crunchy sound of it. Yummy!!!
I love watching your vids! Making bread and rolls has never been easier. Ty!
Is it just me or does she look like June Lockheart??? Lost in space guys
I have never had success with no knead bread/rolls and this was no exception.  I made the overnight version and everything looked the same except that I couldn't get the dough to get unsticky as shown in the video.  I still went ahead and baked them, but they never puffed up.  What did I do wrong.
💙
I knew she   looked familiar, she was on tv many years ago with her own show, she looks great 👍
Now I need a big teeth to have that smile so my bread become good as yours ❤️😂
Very nice recipe, just wanted to ask , dont you need sugar to active the dough proccess? you didnt use sugar but the dough still rose.
I can't believe u answered. Thank u Jenny.  I miss seeing u on t.v..
Add vinegar u gotvsour dou.
Love your chicken. And u Jenny. Put the recipe in the notes. 1 c. Water? Itbwill be luke warm in a glass c u know.
Where do u get those dust pan size spatula,s? 😯
עיברית
Thanks again.
Jenny, you saucy thing, you.
I wonder why your oven takes so long to preheat?
Jenny.    I remember you from tv.      Ur recipes are easy and good.
I think I'm in love.
Your too funny.
WOW AND WOW 1.- I tried for more than half a century to make yeast dough with the same results as Ivy Hays (comment one year ago). But this recipe worked!!! Joy!!! 2.- Because the video is 4 years old and we are still commenting, so still alive.  Fantastic and THANK YOU. I wish, you would make another video again, never mind the recipe, just fun watching you :-) Greetings from Tenerife, Spain.
,
I've been making these for the last three weeks..EXCELLENT! ! ... Did I say how good these are! Followed almost to the "T"... I added 1/2 cup whole wheat for 1/2 cup white... And added 1/2 tsp gluten... Also cooked them on a pizza stone...with a cup of hot water added to a pan underneath... I tried them the original way and found 30 mins too long... I bake for 20-22... They are a hit. Can you say "getting over on the man" !  Never have to run out to the store for bread...seriously, add this to your baking repitoire... Simple...just start in the morning and by lunch, fresh rolls...or just leave them until dinner. Whatever works... Thanks so much.. This is freedom...
I tired your recipe. Kids loved it. my text target is to make chocolate scones. Will it be the same method?
These look yummy!
Tried this and it is a hit ! Thank you
I love and share your  joy  in making rolls and bread!  Thank you !! for sharing!!
Looking tasty Jenny ‼️🍃🌺🍃
Theses look amazing! I want to try this and put "everything but the bagel: seasonings on it
Everytime I used hot tap water it always killed the yeast. I had to start keeping the temp between 78 and 100 degrees to get the results I wanted. Especially with wheat flour.
Why make 'em if you don't need 'em?
Where did you get the scrapers you use. I've looked everywhere
Okay, what I'm I doing wrong?  I've tried three times to make this bread(rolls).  Unfortunately, I've had minimal success.  I do all the steps and have also followed some suggestion from below.  After three hours, no matter what I have tried, it comes out wet.  It always looks like it needs more flour.  It does not look like Jenny's.  Does room temp affect the bread? Humidity? I don't know what else to do.  Help, anyone:0)
Q. Could I use whole wheat pastry flour? What about adding molasses or ground flaxseed meal for a sweetness/ flavor add and some extra nutrition for a morning roll. I do love ciabatta rolls, these are similar? The store charges over 70 cents each for ciabatta rolls!
Notes to self  2.5 cups flour; bread or All purp. .25 tsp yeast  1tsp salt Mix dry ingredients Add 1.25 cup hot water from tap.( or cold water and rest dough overnight) Mix into dough ball on floured board. Place in bowl.  Cover with wrap. Rest on counter for 3 hr. Loosely fold about a dozen times to make workable round shape. Cut into 8 wedges. Shape each wedge w floured hands into round shape. Cover w towel. Sit on counter until oven reaches 450°f Bake on parchment lined sheet for 20 mins. Thanks Jenny!
Great rolls. Where can I buy your red plastic scraper you used to shape and cut dough?
My oven takes  8 minutes to get to the temperature I want. Why does yours take 35 minutes?
I've watched this videos and did not realize this was Jenny jones
Miss Jenny you are simply amazing! Thank you for sharing and for inspiring me !!!
Jenny, you are such a sweet and funny person. I really love watching you cook or bake! Thank you for sharing these super great recipes with the world!
HOT water? no sugar to feed the yeast? My HomeEc teacher would roll in her grave..lol
Yummy!!
Jenny so happy I found you! Just in time for the holidays too!  Thank you so much for sharing your excellent bread making skills! Merry Christmas 🎄.
You’re a lot of fun to watch Jenny! You make stuff fun.
I'm very happy with my buns! This recipe is everything you promised. So easy, so delicious. I substituted 1 cup white flour with whole wheat flour and left it to rise longer. When I took them out of the oven I buttered the tops.
Very nice thank you ... but it looks like a lot more than 1 1/4 cups of hot water you added ...can you confirm that please?
Hi Jenny... Made these yesterday... We love crusty bread around here! Chewy and yummy... Made according to recipe.very good! .. The only thing was they came out with a fairy thick crust, and hard.. I believe my fault.. Maybe baked too long. My oven was probably too hot..still delicious...NICE crumb. I will definitely make again... We ate them right up with soup. Next time, will bake less time and keep the oven at 450.. I think I pushed it to 500👀... Thank you! My hubby loved them...
Ive only just found you and you cracked me up with laughing. Lol. So of course, im going to sub you but what i want to know is, do you ever do gluten free bread?  Im celiac and im missing a decent bread so much!  Hope to hear from you.  Keep up with the laughs. XTibbyX
Does anyone know if this would work with wholemeal flour ?
I love your spunk! Could these be used as hamburger buns as well?
Jenny, please stop using God's name in vain!!! Or I have to stop watching you & I like you other wise.
I love your work..thank you mam
Love your show!
My favorite for sandwiches
😂😂😂😂😂😂👍🏼
veeeery  funny. love it.
you are so funny.I just got the flour mixture ready..cant wait to check these guys out. Yumm. PS...I use ONLY the  no knead method to bake our bread, have for over a year...its perfect , husband loves it too.
Thanks for being so detailed.  Appreciate it
I am giving my retired husband cooking classes and we watched your videos on no knead bread and buns so we are trying them this morning. Very entertaining and they look amazing! thanks!
Does anyone else's buns burn on the bottom?  I have even tried lowering the temperature but halfway through the 25 minute bake they are smoking!  I keep having to shave off the bottom of the bun to get rid of the burned bit and everything else turns out great.  Any advice?
Hi 👋🏻 I’ve just found out I’m Wheat intolerant. Can I use gluten free flour in this recipe? Thanks 🤗
Such a lovely lady, 420k subs!  What it must be like to be in her circle of friends and  family.
First I watch this kind of bread .... I should do this very easy and simple. Thank you so much for sharing
You're a natural Jenny!
I just made this with spelt flour and both yeast and sourdough ( I just added more flour) and they turned out amazing, thank you Jenny
You're so cute, you make me want to kiss the screen every time I watch one of your videos. Can't wait to try this recipe.
I wonder if almond flour would work......A lot of us are trying to cut down a bit on the carbs but I LOVE bread and I don't believe I can do without  :)
wow got to try this out thanks for the Recipe...... lol....... lol  funny Happy Halloween take care
I learn a lot and i m happy to watch you jen so sweet
I live in a high altitude and do I need to change anything g?
I really like your video's. You are funny😁
Thank you
I have a very cold kitchen, how warm does your kitchen need to be so that it rises correctly
I can tell that you love what you do, and it shows in the beautiful bread you bake, and I like your humour. You are a real peach.
Try it and just amazed with them! Easiest recipe I ever try!
Very very
Hi Jenny - I love you coloured items :)
Great recipe . . . and you certainly are a nice lady and yummy mummy. Thank you!
YUM! :)
Smile at the end was hilarious😂😂
HELP! I used 2 1/2 cups of flower and 1 1/4 cup of water and my dough looked nothing liken the video...
Where did you get your red dough scraper and is it made in the USA? The rolls look great.
Can i leave it overnight
2018.  I ❤ you!
Thank you kindly for sharing this easy recipe. Like very much your contagious happiness 😀
you have the best videos ever!! so much personality and great cooking tips!! best youtube channel EVER!! ❤️❤️❤️
I tried this recipe the second time using the hot water method ...didn't work out ...but my first time i did it using cold water overnight actually almost 14 hours later ...came out nicely ...i think I'll stick to cold water from now on ...worked out better
Could you use a starter? If so, how much of the starter would you use?
Just attempted these! I have been trying and failing to make bread. Part of the reason is that I'm really impatient and partly working with old yeast. I even messed these up a little, the dough was too dry because I didn't aerate the flour. BUT while the shape of these are wonky... They taste delicious and the texture is perfect. First time bread has worked for me! Definitely going to make these again and not skip steps.
Classic recipe will try this on sunday
These were SO easy to make - good to see the tips added below.  Mine may have been over stirred as the texture wasn't what I expected, but will try again... now on to some of your other great recipes!
Why does it take your oven sooo long to heat up? Mine takes 10-15 mins😁
I'll try this Jenny, thank you......Sue
Im going to have a go at making this but a classic line ... are you happy with your buns
lol LOVE IT!! TY
I make these and the dutch oven one all the time thanks to you! I am making a big pot of French Onion soup right now for tomorrow and making this in loaves for cutting and putting in the soup.  Thank you so much. I am sorry I never took the time to thank you before.
You're so fun Jenny! #listentothatcrust #lol
Ooooo.I'm making those
You said it tastes like sourdough but how do I make this so it tastes like french bread? Add a bit of sugar? Instead of buying bread I will start making my own. I can do this!
Jenny thanks I would like to try the hard buns
Yum !
you have such a cute and sweet personality! <3 new subbie 💕💗💘💞💝💓💖
Great ! I love it ! Thank You !
Awesome recipe thank you I love it my husband love it
Jenny, have you ever made sourdough bread with your own sour dough starter?   I would love to get a recipe.   Your cooking is awesome.   Charlee
How hot is hot water? Living in Mumbai so the water from the tap is normal and not hot. If you give a temperature for the water I would help...thanks
*Jenny, I love homemade bread, too!!  Especially yeast rolls, etc.  I am going to definitely make these, thanks to your tutorial!  I have to have REAL butter.  I have a feeling you do, too!  I stopped using spreads & margarine many years ago.  Margarine is just highly processed oil.  Yuk!!  Our bodies do NOT recognize margarine, so it can't be processed.  Butter with some homemade apple butter will be great. Oh, I love poppy seeds on homemade bread.  Have a beautiful day!!*
Doesn't the hot water kill the yeast?
Oh!! I m so excited to make these rolls. Tnks for the recipe Jen 😉😉
Jenny, why not cut the dough into 4  when you are making your beef stew.  Cut top off and empty insides and serve beef stew in crusty buns.  I plan that for the weekend.
WOW delicious! Will try making soon. Thank you Jenny!
Hi Jenny the buns look awesome . Do u have the measurements in grams
Hi Jenny I am a grandma that love cooking and create new recipes - have you made a book? Where to get the written recipes? Some time I am not so fast to download- MARINA
Oh my God! I kept on saying "where do I know this woman from" perhaps a friend of a friend or is she colleague  from high school? Where do I know her from!? Then BANG it hit me! It's JENNY!! So good to see you!  You look awesome! Looking forward to following and watching you here on YouTube. All my best to you.
I love your breads love am all thanks so much  hugs maria
OMG!!! Your site is by far the BEST on You Tube!!! Thanks Jenny
Its really replacing kneading with self rising...i enjoy the kneading very therapuetic.

Hi Jenny, I love watching your videos and to try them out. This video made me smile along especially when I saw your BIG smile😋 Enjoy 🤗
Loved your video, you explained everything well and have to say you are a great watch thank you x
We're told we shouldn't use hot tap water for cooking.
I made these last night for my family and they were delicious.  Thank you so much for sharing.  Baking them again tonight dough is rising at home.  :-)
I grew up watching your show and now I’m watching you cook. Great to see your still looking great and you throw down in the kitchen. Love it
Roll came out great looking. Made then around 4:30 and had it at dinner around 7pm. The crust was hard and chewy how can I avoid this.
I am English and get confused about cups as measurement
450 degree oven (thermometer), and after 25 minutes the rolls came out nicely brown and crispy, but the inside was semi-doughy. Any longer in the oven and the outside would be inedible. Advice?
Great video…thanks for posting!!
i made my first ones now i wait do see how the come out. the going in the oven now .saved the recipe
I love watching you Jenny.  Your easy, relaxed delivery along with those great recipes makes for wonderful videos.  Thank you.
LOL, you have a wonderful smile, Jenny!
you make it look easy...
Hi Jenny thanks u
Thank you for sharing your way !!! I'm trying the rolls ,
Love your recipes
Hello Jenny! You are so funny and talented. I love your cooking/baking channel that I subscribed since last year. However, I'm been following you since you had your talk show, loved it. But I find you more relax and happy now than then. Thanks for sharing this more personal part of you!
😂😂 I really enjoy your show & the fun, learn stuff too, keep up the good show!!👍👍
Can I use rising flour ? Is the only flour I have
Thank you
great i will try it. thanks
Hi Jenny. Do u make any gluten free goodies?
Haha the ending was hilarious
Your videos are so much fun! Keep it up!
Where can I  buy a big wood piece like you have to roll out dough on etc.?
I love your teeth😆
What about self rising flour? Would I omit the yeast?
💜💜 lol
A wonderful recipe. Have made it 3 times. Divided it in 5 pcs and used as hamburger rolls. I put a pan of hot water in the oven to make steam and they are super crusty. To solve the messy dough problem I use a baking sheet and put about 1/2 cup of flour on it. No mess. Keep your hands dry and floury.
I watched this, the first time, six months ago. Since then, I have made these and several other breads.  We no longer buy any kind of bread.  Now my writing room is full of bags of flour.
Thought you looked familiar hello
Thumbs down
BLESSINGS JENNY CAN COOK, AND MANY THANKS FOR ALL YOUR VIDEO'S AND RECIPES:).
Lol “are you happy with your buns? I am!”
i really like you! do you enjoy camping a few nights at a time?
Your so cute.. I love your videos.  Great women great personality. Thanks Jenny
I spent too much for bread in my local bakery.   Will try this one very soon.  Collected a lot of your recipes over time.  You're fantastic and hilarious 😙😍
På svenska
Love to watch you. Soooo funny!
Jenny you are so much fun to watch and the recipes are so easy thank you
Nice job genius

damn jenny u a breadmaster
Xo@
I love her hair style lol so cute
I love all your timers!
I get so excited just looking at you and them, I think I can do that. Thank you so much.
Hi Jenny from Canada...from a fellow polish gal...luv this recipe...you were my mom's and my fave talk show host...smart...funny and informative...so now this is so great watching you share your amazing creative recipes. Luv ya...xxx Cheers...Na zdrowie!
Hi Jenny, is it possible to bake crusty rolls from spelt or semolina?
Good,good,good
Jenny..........I'm a widowed mature male and not a stranger to a kitchen; but a stranger to baking bread.  Have been successful  with pizza crust and loaf bread in a mold.  Typically I don't sift the flour but did on this recipe due to the "aerate" suggesting at beginning of video.  Following the exact measurements the dough was very soupy; almost a viscus fluid.  Ended up adding about another 2/3 cup of flour just to bring it to the consistency in your video.  Everything else followed to a "T" including the parchment.  Found all of my rolls sufficiently stuck to the parchment.  Cognizant that all ovens times & temps will vary, I began checking mine at 15 minutes.  Ended up leaving them in for 21 minutes to obtain similar crust as yours. Would you recommend I use flour on the parchment paper next time or a light spray of cooking oil to prevent sticking?  Also, did I do something wrong with my measurements that my dough turned out so soupy?? My background is in BioChemistry so I am usually very exact with my measurements and by habit, double check everything.  Any advice you can give me would be greatly appreciated.  Love the teeth and a woman with a good sense of humor!!!!
Thanks Jenny! I'm going to try this today!  Do you think it will work well with Whole Wheat Flour?
Can not follow if you do not give the weight of ingredients. One cup can vary too much in size too.
You are a cutie-pie, Jenny!  Will try your roll recipe.  I made an Artisan no-knead bread loaf in our Dutch Oven and it came out great.
I make no knead bread every 2 or 3 days, but the buns are a great idea because the hardest part of making your own bread is getting the bread knife through the bottom of the loaf. Can be quite a workout. Thanks for the recipe Jenny. My dough is rising right now!
I am also excited, these are by far the BEST THINGS EVER! I AM MAKING THEM CONSTANTLY NOW!everyone loves them.
😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋
You dont use hot water .water have to be warm with yeast.
You are so funny Jenny. I bake more because of you. I love bread as well!
Jenny:  Are those rolls anything thing ciabatta rolls?
I knew you looked familiar! I used to watch your show as a teenager! Love you and your yummy food!
I LOVE your recipes!!!
he jenny i all ready made your no knead bread and it was GREAT STUFF .now i'm gonna do the rolls and let you now how my hungryfamily loved them rolls. we love jenny's no knead rolly's
Great stuff my sons going to be happy Thank you👍🕊💫💫💫💫💫👵🏻
Can you make crusty buns with whole wheat flour instead of bread flour?
Jenny, you are so fun to watch, I love your videos. Thanks for the recipe!
Hi, Jenny After 2 years since I first found your recipes, I still make them and they come out always delicious. I'd like to leave a suggestion concerning the use of single use plastic film to cover the bowl.  There are many containers with lids that can be used alternatively. With worldwide effort to reduce plastic use, specially single-use plastics, I thought it could be a good idea to spread the habit of reusable plastics.  Again and again, thanks for sharing your recipes and know-how.
Is that about 200-250C? Czechia Prague
Those rolls do not look too great inside .... rather imploded into a dense raw dough ball with a disintegrated crust too hard to chew. No steam in the oven does that to the dough.
Cougar town
You make everything in the kitchen fun😊
I can not get past the pink piggy timer,I think my main focus went to the pink piggy.I feel like I been hypnotized.
You can avoid much of the sticky clean up by shaping the dough in a bowl of flour.  Knock off the excess flour before placing it on a pan.  Then you won't need the flour board if you use a scale.
Qué simpática, natural y guapa 😘😉😆.....y además panadera.💗
You look great Jenny :)
U R The sweetest
Thanks Jenny - my arthritis doesn't let me knead too much !! this is great !!
it is good see that you are okay!you still have fans out there love and miss you alot!
I love your recipes. Yumm!
I follow your recipes and keep for my large Family. Thank you.
You’ve got the cutest smile ever. Loved the smile at the end
I rememberJenny from televisionalways wonder why she legt & the crabby ppl stayed. Beautiful woman
If you want to come across as a professional, ditch the fake teeth and be more serious.
I stumbled upon your video by accident and said to myself that looks like Jenny Jones and sure know if that is you can used to watch your show all the time. I’m going to try to make this bread thank you
Very hot water kill the yeast!
These are amazing. I've made them dozens of times now. Thank you so much!!😁
You're awesome...I've tried alot of your recipes and they're all amazing . love you Jenny
Jenny, you are just the cutest cook . I so enjoy your techniques with the humor. And your recipes are easy peesey.  Thanks....Keep Smiling
Hi Jenny,  love this recipe but the only thing that happens is the inside not might a fluffy it a bit doughy.... why would that be? The crust is amazing through 😉
How do you not kill the yeast with your "very hot water " ??!!
I just found this, After recently wanting to learn to make bread. Ive tried FIVE other recipes with failure. I made this recipe, but kept it in a single bead loaf, and WOWWWWW! It turned out perfect!!! BEST EVER!!! Thank you so very much!
Hi jenny.. I love easy  recipe thanks

Love love this ive done it with whole wheat flour i added a little bit of white flour it came out amazing thank you so much for the recipe.
This was just as easy as you made it seem- family loved them and said they tasted just like the ones from a local restaurant. Thanks for posting!
Are you happy with your buns? I am!  :)
You are a very good teacher,   I want to try these!  Thank you
LOVE your recipes!
Emi: if I want to surprise dad and make a loaf of bread, I do everything like the rolls but how long to cook?
Tap water has chlorine in it and chlorine kills yeast.
Good video Jenny!  The rolls look great.  And that smile on your face at the end of the video is too funny.  Thanks for sharing.
Would love to make these but won't the hot water you add to the flour mix kill the yeast? Most bread recipes call for lukewarm water 105-110 degrees. Thanks for sharing~ Bon Appetit!
Made the recipe, but mine didn't turn out.  I did use a high quality thermometer reading in the water at 130F to give it every chance to rise.  It was passible, but made a smaller, denser loaf than my usual 18 hour rise.
I’m sorry to correct you  can’t use hot water from the tape because it’s not safe to use it has lead it effects the kids more than the Adult
Can this be done with just baking powder not yeast ?
Gosh, you are real! Thanks, you seem so normal and approachable. It’s been a pleasure.
Is that Ms Lippy from Billy Madison?
Love them Jenny!
Has she ever said where she gets her colorful work utensils??
Jenny, will you adopt me please?
Jenny dear...Should you ever come to Southeastern Ohio, my Dentist could do wonders with those teeth of yours...  \//\| |/ || \|   LOVE... LOVE... LOVE all your terrific videos & comedic personality...I bet you'd make a great sister...grins
*”Are you happy with your buns?”*  I actually died
My whole wheat buns turned out PERFECTLY! Thank you for a WONDERFUL recipe and presentation. :-)
Yassss...jenny!!!!
Great Share.😊. Ty Jenny. 😊.💌
Oh my God, why didn't I come across this recipe all this while? I spent years trying different difficult versions, and having rocks instead of breads. I liked your idea so I gave it a try. I had to add water and yeast though. After leaving it overnight because I couldn't bake it in the middle of the night, I covered my working surface and my hands with flour, put the rolls on the baking sheet for about 20 minutes then bake them at 450° for exactly 30 minutes. It was amazing! Exactly how you described them. We had them with butter and hot cacao for breakfast then with steak for lunch. Even my 10 months old baby girl loved it. I am definately subscribing!
Can I leave more than 3 hours?
I just wish you were my neighbor 😂😂 you’re so much fun Love your vids, your recipes and your sense of humor!!!
Madame Jenny, this is my second vidéo and I must say i LOVE your humer lolll your so funny and adorable and its so cute when you get all exited with the final results! Im so going to try this !
Thank you for the recipe.  I made them tonight and they are very good.  And, no worries, you don't have to answer, I know you have tons of followers.
You are Awesome!
HAHAHA love your smile
Thanks very helpful and great smile!!
All I gotta say is WOW!
Love you.  I never missed  your show on TV,  Jenny, your recipes are so tasty. I have made every thing.  You are so funny, I share your Videos with everyone.  xoxo
América needs more women like her,, ,  BRAVO
You look exactly like Candace Bergen.
Thank you, Jenny!  You provide very helpful cooking instructions in a very joyous style! Love your scrapper & spoon, too.
Love making bread, I've just tried my own How Too video, crusty tasty plait, check it out. https://youtu.be/dUcPC5a6JyQ
You are so cute Jenny bless you<3 going to try these now! Thank you
my first bread rolls, i ate them all
You are still awesome! I always have loved your personality. I can't wait to try this recipe.
Very lovely lady 😊👍
The practice of using hot tap water for tea or in recipes is problematic. Some sources claim it's Ok; others say it's a health risk.  Consider this then.  Most, if not all, water heaters incorporate a sacrificial anode made of one of the following metals - magnesium, aluminum, or zinc.  Without going into details they slow the corrosion of the iron tank by their own corrosion.  Ergo, you have either magnesium, aluminum, or zinc salts in your hot water which may or may not be unhealthy but more than likely will affect the taste of the bread.  Since most households have a microwave oven it makes more sense to heat the water in the oven.  A cup of cold tap water in a 1000 watt oven will be uncomfortably hot in about 50 secs.  One can always use the wrist test to check temp; however, since instant read thermometers are cheap (about $5) I'd recommend purchasing one for general use around the kitchen.  Whenever I make yeast breads I always use a digital thermometer regardless of the liquid of choice.  Plus I proof my yeast before adding it to the flour but only because that's how I've always done it.  It's a step you can skip as long as your are not using yeast past it's expiration.  I proof because it gives the yeast a nice head start and only takes 10 minutes.
I just made this and it turned out great. So yummy. Thanks Jenny 😘.
Ciasto odpoczywa i za trzy godzinki pieczemy. :) Dzięki.
Doubled the recipe, no problem at all......perfection.   I saw a rye roll very similar to this with 2 to 1 bread and rye flour, going to try this next!
PERFECT ROLLS!!!!   SO EASY AND FAST .  TY JENNY I LOVE THIS CHANNEL AND ILL KEEP COMING BACK!
Love the last smile! Picture perfect!!
Well, they are baking as we speak. I didn't find the dough sticky and everything was easy to handle. I used bread flour, in case that mattered. Just excited to see the results, so far everything was great! Thanks for your exciting shows and recipes.
Great instructional video :) Subbed!
Thanks for your culinary enthusiasm. You're fun to watch and amazingly professional. Brilliant.
Can u use instant yeast
Made these this morning. Started the dough last night after dinner. It was so simple and fun to make. My neck can’t take all the kneading in other recipes. My family loves these and they will definitely be a part of our family meals.
It's nice to see you back!
Jenny  YUM!  I made these today again . This time I used 1 3/4 cups flour  and  3/4 cup of Whole wheat flour and  just a tad more yeast because of the wheat flour .... ... turned out perfect.
Great recipe and well presented! I'll try it and let ya know!!
The camera person set the exposure balance for Jenny, and that's great.  But he/she didn't reset the exposure for the dough, so it is totally blown out and white.  It would be helpful to actually be able to see what a successful dough looks like.  Love the recipe!
Oh my god I made this bread today and it’s just beautiful and yummy and I’m so happy ❤️❤️❤️
you make it so simple and you're funny!!!
Made these today for dinner party ,stunning oh my the crispy crunch!!! Pure heaven. Thanks to you ,I sprayed mine with water every 5 min in oven to get that tartine patina yummy
That was very wrong, never never use hot tap water ,it is very very toxic , will kill you, it is poison, heat the cold water on the stove.
I tried and it was a complete failure. the dough didn’t rise enough and as per  the measurements , l added 1 1/4 cup water was not enough for 2 1/2  cup of flour so l had to add more water. Can you please tell me where did l go wrong.
I must try this. I am the cook at my house and my wife is very much a bread person. I think she will love these. I hope so, bread is getting very expensive.
love you Jenny...the teeth!!!! stop!!! what about brushing melted butter on top!!!!??!?
You are such a lovely person :)
Hi Jenny, what  can I say?  You are the best! I had given up on bread making when I stumbled across your recipe. I thought I would give it one more try so I tried the overnight method. I just finished eating 4 rolls! They turned out exactly as yours, crunchy on the outside and soft inside. So a million thanks! I encourage every one to try it. It's really a no fail recipe.
I knew you looked familiar😜 Jenny Jones💖💖💖
Jenny...I make the all the time now my friends and family love these rolls...they are still good the next day crunchier but still good..thank you...
Yummy rolls that look easy to make. I will have to try them. Thanks for sharing!!
Just a quick question if anybody knows... I thought hot water killed your yeast??
Jenny,your hotter than your cooking,and that's steaming!
your microphone needs to be one more button down
i LOVE LOVE YOUR COOKING .. YOU MAKE ME SOO HAPPY ..BLESS YA !
Débile!,   Moi qui n'a jamais été capable de faire un pain mangeable, cette recette est stupéfiante. J'ai utilisé de la farine de blé et c'est excellent! GROS MERCI JENNY!  vous êtes extra!  👍🏻👍🏻😃😋😋😋
can you make 2 tray together
She is very cute. She reminds me of Jenny Jones. But Jenny Jones can't bake, so she wins! I am definitely gonna try this- What, I only now read it is Jenny Jones!  Good,  now I don't have to choose, LOL! I was saying that I am gonna try this and come back for some other rolls.
You are really sooooo lovely and cute 😘 I tried many of your bread recipes and the results was amazing 😍😍😍 Thank uuuuuuu 😘😘😘
teeth very funny
Stickiest dough I ever worked with!  Less water is essential.
Made these today. Splendid results.
I just need the parchment paper.  I'm looking forward to making some of these no fuss rolls.
Can I do this with rice flour
The recipe and the process were really easy.  I followed the ingredients just as you said.  Everything went very nicely.  The only thing I notice is that the rolls didn't have any flavor.  Did anyone else notice this?
Jenny   Honey NEVER cook with hot water from the tap. Always heat cold water.  When you use hot water from the tap you are  ingesting sediment and bad chemicals  that come from your hot water heater!!!  Lovve your recipes  I make many of them .
She is so cute! :)
wow..I'm impressed...thanks Jenny
I love this woman. I want one! :D
You are a skilled chef and you know how to make us laugh. Thank you 😂😂
😂😂  You are a skilled chef and you know how to make us laugh. Thank you
Wow, I haven't seen you in a long time. I loved your show! It's good to hear your friendly voice again! I clicked on your channel because the picture of the rolls looked so good!
why didn't I marry someone like you?
i  enjoy your bread making program, but love your happy qualities
question for Jenny... can I double the bread roll recipe and make 16 instead of just 8 ?
I have made these 2 times and the bread loaf once... AMAZING ... very good and so easy !   you just to follow the recipe perfectly...   the water you add to the recipe... I measured the temp... good thing, I would have not used hot enough water... these are so good my hubby wants them often, we all love them !  Thank you Jenny for showing this recipe !
jen bis the greatest
35 minutes to preheat her oven, hmmm?
You ought to make bread baseballs with writing on them
You are still cute as a bug! Love how easy you make everything look and the "you can do this too" spirit. Can't wait to try this recipe. God bless you, dear!❤️
your so fun - and your recipes are delicious jenny thank you for shareing ! Always make me laugh !
Oh my who would of thought you were so multi-talented...not to mention beautiful too! Watched your comedian act and now I'm making your no -knead buns..I'm sure they will be as good as you are! Have a good day! JENNY CAN COOK!
I'm on it, Jenny!!! You're the greatest.
Too difficult to be compelled to watch videos. They take away bandwidth from my husband's computer. Everyone else offers text as well.  So I regret I can't sign up. Your recipes sounded great.
Jenny, what is your secret for keeping your youthful figure and obvious health, in spite of being a bread lover. You are amazing.
Your presentation is wonderful and i love your excitement as your making your creations! I cant wait to make your recipes. Thanks for posting :-)
Jenny when you make your round bread can I put it  in anything round that has a cover
Nice !
Jenny watched you when you had you TV talk show many moons ago. You look marvelous darling, keep baking, and creating!
Thank you for sharing!
so happy I found you. wondered what you have been doing since I watched your show in 90's.
You're so funny!
I can smell it through the computer!
Tried these overnight, and they were GREAT!  I did add a tablespoon of sugar for taste.  They turned out beautifully!
Jenny, I can't decide which I love more...your buns or your sense of humor!
A bread person understands your excitement.  Always funny Jenny. Hope you're ok.  Haven't heard from you for a while
You are genuinely sweet Jennie
Thank you, Jenny. I am going to do this for my granddaughters.
watch your hand Jenny, , looking great.
If I put butter on the rolls before baking , will they still be crusty ?
Good ones. Have to share this.
yum just yum!
I have a friend with severe allergies to Wheat and yeast.What kind of bread or roll can he/she make?
Ok your cool - subscribed
Hi Jenny I love your cooking show even the little jokes you may have a Bless day
you do know that hot water from the tap is not food grade rated, right.
She's such a nut.   LOL Great recipe, looks easy!!
I didn't know the difference between yeast and baking powder so I made with baking powder, I'm so afraid they won't turn out ok omg edit: they turned out like cookies, after they got cold they tasted like flour so, really bad mistake
Dear Jenny, I got to you randomly, but it was a love on the first sight! All your recepies are great and I love your enthúsiasm and humor! Keep going and all the best!!
oh my goodness!  I have missed you and just happened to stumble on your videos!!  so good to see you!!!
Thank- You so much for your recipes on your channel for Dutch Oven bread. I haven't made it yet but will very soon. Great easy recipe..... And I know your enthusiasm is sincere," Foodies" get that.
For liquid you could probably use buttermilk
Hello! May I leave the dough for more 3 hours? which would make it a total of 6 hours.?
hello Jenny  I will appreciate if you can compare F°to C° as I'm a Polish and we use Celsius ° temperature not Fahrenheit.  It is my first time that I watched your chanel on YouTube and I am amazed 🙆 ,I love it. Thank you ☺
I really enjoy you videos. I used to what you on your tv show too... It looks like you are having so much fun cooking.
love my bread too and this recipe sounds too good to be true - thank you Jenny
You crack me up!  I love your video.
Great Video!! Check our website to see Amarra and her Papa make some bread as well.
I  like watching you make your bread and rolls. You are a happy soul. unfortunately, for me being a Diabetic, this is not for me but enjoyed watching three process. Thank you. You  can brighten up anyone's dull moment.
Can I please ask as I have looked at your q and a and cannot find the info. Do you cook the bread and rolls with or without the fan on?  Many thanks. Trina
Jenny its time for you to have your own tv show! I love your recipes and you make it so much more fun than the other shows on TV. THE THRUTH IS YOU HAVE A PERSONALITY And that makes a big difference! love you baby!
I went to school for Baking and Pastry Arts, and baking rolls was always so annoying because of all the endless weighing, shaping, and proofing. But this looks so easy and stress-free! I've avoided baking except for the holidays since my school experience, but watching your videos makes me want to get back into it. Thanks!
You are a wonderful cook
This is literally the easiest bread recipe I've watched! Thanks for your generous sharing! Can't wait to try out!
You are too sweet!  Thank you for this video.  I'll be sure to watch your other ones.  So helpful!
Hahahaha.....  Love the teeth..... Gonna try this recipe.... Hahaha
italiano per favore
I absolutely LOVE your enthusiasm. Your smile is awesome! Great voice, great presentation. All that is regardless of how your bread recipe is :o) I'm sure the bread is great too. You're saving a ton of time for people and teaching a healthy recipe. Thank you. By the way, are you single?
Great job ! You are so funny ..Can't wait to try it :-) Hugs from New Zealand
😆
You are such a bright and positive optimistic person and I love bread just as much as you!  What a great recipe!
Jenny!  Thank you.  :)
Love that you give different options for questions you just know people are wondering
You are so lovely to watch Jenny! You look so happy baking those delicious looking buns/rolls! I'll make your recipe soon :)
i like it., thanks.
Jenny your the best n your videos are perfect!! Your so funny too !
Oh and thank you so much for your wonderful work
Haha Jenny, you are so joyful. My day is a little bit brighter after watching this video. I have been watching many of your videos for a while now and just today I realized that I had not subcribed to your chanel. What?!? how did that happen?? So clumsy
I like to kneed my bread... you know I love bread, so I give it all love I can offer it ;)  Kneeding isn't actually that big of a deal, 10 minutes is usually fine. And it has the advantage, that it doesn't take so long. You know the thing with the gluten... I either needs long time to develope or a good kneed. So I kneed it...  But since I love bread so much, I love to handle it like a queen ;)
You're ADORABLE
mine turned out dense inside.. what I did wrong??  >_<
YUMMMMMY & best of all its "blonde proof" 💁
Yum! i love your excitement!
AMAZING. I have to subscribe.
😑
Why did my rolls stick to the parchment paper.
I tried the rolls again and aerated the flour with a sifter & it is still dry. So I give up. Lol  The rolls are forgiving but the loaf was not done all the way inside & was very dense yet crispy on the outside.
wow these buns are the best, Thank you for this video.
I got to say I loved the teeth at the end hahahaha
Love ur videos. I made your bread and it was great. Where's your fridge in your kitchen? Like the layout but no fridge! (Were remodeling).
Thank you Jenny for sharing! Love it!❤👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
Can i put some surgar in it to make it a little sweet
Thank you,you are funny,I like the way your taught how to bake.God bless you.
These were beautiful, but so dense we could hardly eat them.  I have had to resort to creative ways to use them up.  Even French toast was too tough!  I added a bit of sugar, so the first rising went great.  I did time the second rising to 35 minutes (even though my oven preheats faster), but it wasn't enough.
Thanks for your prompt reply Jenny.  Rolls turned out soooo nice. absoutley love it!  Just knew that you were TV presenter/actress, u r amazing !  All the best。 ♡
She is so cute.
can i use instant yeast ?
try to do with wholemeal flour... then return here and tell me if your receipe works :) I tell you this because now, with this receipe, you are eating only sugar... understand this? wholemeal's receipe is more difficult to do
I've made these and I'm making the loaf now.  On the first mix, it was dry, not wet, for both of the recipes. I think either your flour or water measurements are off. The rolls turned out OK. I'll see what happens with the loaf.
how do i know this woman?. she seems familiar
will do this!! thank you!!
i follow the recipe literally word by word and the dough was too loose almost impossible to work with, the rolls were collapsing  now i put them to rest while the oven is heating. let's see how they come out...
I love your personality. Keep up the good and fun work
Aww Hi Jenny,I love your channel,your so funny. thank you. Cooking looks fun again
What ever became of that baseball ⚾️ anywho??
new baker here  why cover with towel and not plastic wrap.?  thanks
Who knew? Jenny can cook! Can't wait to make this as a part of my arsenal.  I have been looking for a quick style bread like this.  Thank you.
Is it me or is the yeast amount is stated as only 1/4 teaspoon?! This amount is not enough and your dough will not rise. Instead try 1 and 1/4 teaspoon of yeast! You will have success for sure.
love you jenny, you are so bubbly and happy :)
Where is Jenny Can Cook?  I miss her.
I put chopped ham and shredded cheddar cheese in some of the rolls a few days ago.  With a little mustard,, they were amazing.  My spouse has been taking them for lunch at least once every couple of weeks.  It's been 4 months now since I bought bread.  My white bread made by the same method as well as this artisan French style bread have gotten pretty good.  Thanks to Jenny I can bake bread again (I did as a teenager but not since until this year).  My spouse likes to take the rolls from this recipe and likes to make breakfast with them.  He puts ham cheese and a scrambled or fried egg on it.  He likes it better than an egg muffin from Mickey D's.
ARE U HAPPY WITH YOUR BUNS DEADDD😂😂
Yummy! Next, homemade butter.
Just made these today, best rolls ever!!!
Just made these today, best rolls ever!!!
great recipe turned out good
I am a new learner on bread making, when u said a cup of flour, it means how much, what's the size of a cup? Pls help and thanks
ME GUSTA TU EMOCION ES MUY DIVERTIDA GRACIAS
I followed this to the letter and ended up with a porridge type thing, nothing like yours, :( I want some. lol. Incidentally I used self raising flower because that's all I had, could that be the problem? I really want to make some of these. X
love your video so pleasant.
"are you happy with your buns?" OMG..lol
Thanks for the 🍞🥖🥐recipes. In the video for No-Knead bread you look like Minnie Mouse. In this video you look like Pippi Longstocking. 🙇🏼‍♀️👧🏼Ha ha! Sorry.
Delicious bread! Loved it! Thank you for the recipe!
When you say it's 'like sour dough' I hope you mean it does NOT taste like sour dough.  Otherwise - awesome.  Do you ever put a pan of hot water in the oven?
Thank you Jenny, for your No Knead recipes - It's a staple in my house now. So Easy! Thank You for all the years growing up with you (It seems) in my life (On TV) I'm sure I learned to cook via you. Thanl You also for your personal story, and now efforts to help others. Ladies..."Support Your Girls" http://www.jennyjones.com/bio.shtml
Thank you 😃
How does a 70 year old woman look this damn good???????
Marry Me !
Great and easy way to make bread!
I just made your bread...........It turn out just like your video..............only you, are a pretty cook..............
you da man
lol you crack me up
is this 450 C or F? - i come from a place that uses celsius not farenheit so i must know and if it is farenheit what is it in C? please do tell - thanks
You are delightful and inspiring 😋
Omg! I just made these. Thanks Jenny, they were awesome and so easy.  Amazing how simple :-)
lovely smile lmaooooo
your so sweet jenny
Congratulations you are amazing!
u make baking so easy, I just hope mine come out as beautiful as ur😥
Just saw this .... Your upbeat and funny love your bread recipe !!
I made your Faster No Knead bread a few days ago.  It came out perfect.  I used cold water and let it sit about 27 hours.  I baked it in my Visions Dutch Oven (glass) but broke the lid so I used the lid from my enamel stock pot.  I will also make the whole wheat version.  I always use King Arthur 100% White Whole Wheat Flour.     Today I will make your recipe  for No Knead Crusty Rolls.  Looks very easy.    I anticipate they will be perfect because I will follow the recipe exactly.  However, I also plan to make another batch to serve to my friends for Friday night dinner instead of the traditional Challah braided egg bread.  Each roll will be flavored  a bit differently (one with fennel  seeds, one with caraway seeds, one with cinnamon/raisins, one with lightly sauteed onion/garlic, one with Rosemary, one with oregano/chives, one with flax and chia seeds, and one with grated lemon/orange rind and tell my dinner guests we are having Artisan Surprise Rolls.     Thank you for your excellent videos, Jenny.  Your enthusiasm is contagious.
wondering if you can brush Olive Oil on top w/o burning. possible garlic olive oil.  personally I love garlic. so if there is a way of adding garlic better yum.
You should never use hot Tap water for food.
her buns look tasty
i have never ever seen someone being so excited about bread! this is the first video i'm seeing of you and it didn't took much more to subscribe to your lovely channel!
now i made your crusty rolls, mine come out very heavy densed, not every time but it is very doughy and not that crispy  as yours comes out  please advise thank you
Wow Jenny Jones! miss your show. Can't wait to get my oven fixed so I can try this. thanks.
beautiful smile, keep up the joy and excitement!
lol
can you put in a little bit of sugar or not?
Awsome!!!!! thank you so much!!!!! just subscribed so I'm off to search your clips too find more JEMS!!!!! :0))
the best is went take out of the oven my brothers and I always get very hot b
Do you have a gluten free bread or roll recipe?
Love your enthusiasm about making bread!!! As a bread person myself...totally understand your happiness... : ) Will try this recipe
Thank you for your teaching... your great!
so easy and amazng! thanks :)
I just found this! I watched it, and I realized that I know that voice! Jenny Jones!!! missed you! Good to see you again! I subscribed to your chanel!
Hey all, I just made these but slightly different. I don't have parchment paper so I used a little canola spray. I wanted smaller rolls so I put them in a standard cup cake pan. So, since I am making smaller rolls I turned the heat down to 390. Also, since I substituted some ground flax seed for flour I added a bit more water, some honey, and had it sit covered overnight. It really puffed up and are nicely brown! I'll be making these again.
i think u give a wonderful explination of how to bake the bread and also ur energy. dont change and keep on baking.👧
Excellent, it worked so nice - Would like to know if you can double this recipe to make 16 rolls?
You make everything look so easy, Hank you.
Jenny is fun and wonderful chief cook . Special baking.  I love your video and recipes, thank you!
Tku for responding! I have a small otg but even after 45 mins it did not touch 400.. it seems to be having a thermostat which keeps going off I feel that is the culprit..🤔pl advise..🙏
Hi Jenny ..! Just trying out the buns again but in the oven I see them breaking apart from the top☹️ n after 20 mins they aren't brown tops either
you certainly can cook Jenny you made me so happy. when I was a teenager I used to work at Mothers pride bakery-a huge bakers in England.  I have made bread rolls for the last 10 years and everyone enjoys them but they need lots of kneeding. your rolls seem much easier to make and the method reminds me of the method used by machines,sans the flour improvers.  I am definitely gonna try  you are funny too!
I love your enthusiasm!
Nice. These might make good burger buns too. I will give it a shot tomorrow. I was going to make a sourdough but I decided to watch a movie with some friends and I don't want to stay up for another couple hours making the dough.
You are awesome! I love your way of teaching.....you are so much fun! Love you Jenny keep it up!❤️
I'm no baker, but I baked these yesterday following the recipe to dot! They are piece of art! So easy and quick to make. My hubby loved them and he is very particular about his rolls! Thank you for great recipe!
Jenny this is backwards on the posting, but I like your can bread, it is nice if you are not used baking in any farm or field, thankxx
You are awesome hahahaha
Thank you ....so much fun to watch and I hate the kneading ....thank you for an easy method....watching the buns video now.....foccacia bread?  Didn't spell it right....do you have a video for that one?  Love it but can't spell it!  ugh!  Again thanks for sharing...so easy and fun!
You are a HOOT I love it!!

Does whole wheat flour work?
Hi, Jenny where can get those beautiful spatula ,dish cloth and small bowls to buy?.
You are right Jenny-Food porn :(  So good
JENNY JONES!!!!! This video came on automatically, while I was getting all my ingredients together for the previous No-Knead Bread recipe,  I heard her voice and it sounded so familiar!  GAAAAH!!! Takes me back to the 90s--80s???? She was a great talk show host back then, always candid, informative and so funny!  Jenny, nice to see you again-you have not aged a second! Great rolls recipe- my family loved them!
you are just so adorable. when I found this channel I felt..... I gain  a mother, a sister and afriend. I do not have any close by. thank you fir sharing your gifts.

I love you
You are adorable!!!  I love love your humor!
you're a delight! very comprehensive instruction, and you're a funny lady! thanks!
Jenny Can you tell us where you bought that board,? That your using for the Dough.? Thank You.?
If you use any water over 110 Degrees,? it will Kill any of your Yeast.? So you must take the time & measure the Temp of the water etc.? You look so adorable  with those Pig Tails in your Hair.?
tried to make this. how can one and a quarter cups of water go into two and a half of flour. did not work for me.flour was dry mix.
Looks great
Sweet.
Lol, love the teeth!!!! You are my favorite baker!!! I have started thinking its time to start baking again. With my am broken, I didn't think I could. Now I know I can. Thank you!!!
what no sugar &no oil amazing can it be done with half wholemeal flour &half white flower
I love your videos !!  Are you willing to do some more for us????
Holy Jesus, I just realized this was Jenny Jones!  "Jenny Jones My Life" was one of the few books I've read front to back (I'm not a reader... LOL)
Can I add fresh grated garlic and dried basil? Would the consistency change if I do? I was thinking it could be like garlic bread crusty rolls
parchment paper can be expensive. Can you give alternatives?
I'm not happy with my buns.... they are too big!  ;)
Hello Jen,I like you very much. You are very happy,smiling all the Tim e and jokingly .i love all your bread very easy to follow beacuse yo explain it beautifully. I recommended you to my friends also the one who lives in Sweden.
Enjoy watching this lady.
I thanks for sharing.
Can I make a loaf of bread using this same recipe?
What do you do if you don't have yeast or even the money to buy it?

Dear Jenny, thanks for this instructive tutorial. During medieval era bakers believed that bread becomes better digestable when letting dough sit for approx 24 hours.  Additional mineral nutrients and  micro elements are created by letting dough sit. Thus people don't have that problem of  too much gas formation during digestion. So my question is, when it is best point to add yeast when one lets  dough rest for 24 hours?
I make no knead dough for rolls. I use 1 tablespoon of yeast and it's ready in 1 hour!
Love your colorful kitchen.
Good teacher, thanks.
What a lovable Lady
very nice Apu.
Just make 4 then have soup ready too, to pour in side
If the dough is so soft and sticky, why not add flour into the basic recipe to make it more workable???

hi i only started watching your videos today because every time i go to my grandads the one thing i look forward to is making bread and donuts with him he lets me do it but helps me and now i think its time to show him what he taught me and make bread so i typed up how to make bread and this video popped up and i decided to make bread by the why i am only ten and you have inspired me to bake bread and know its time to make my grandad proud thank you so much
i just have to Tell you how much my family loves your Bred. we are living in France, I am German but we are eating only your Bred. thank you very much, hope you are doing well.💐
u such a lovely woman and great cook😚
I love these and make them often. All your videos are great. That smile...You are such a dork. :)
thank you for your help still 1 question where shell I place the baking  tray in the Celsius  oven the total bottom shelf or the medium 🙈🙉🙊
I made it it was disaster.  1. bread got burnt from down .2   my oven kept switching off . 3. my oven has Celsius numbers 😨😭😭😫
Thanks for your recipes Mrs Jenny. They are very usefull. You know, i tried to make my own bread before. The result was look just like yours. i though i made a mistake at that time.  I m now feel confident after seen your video. God Bless you. Amen
This recipe is amazing! I made them twice (once plain with the 3 hours technique, once semi-whole wheat overnight) and they turned out amazing each time.  What is incredible about this recipe is that there is literally no work involved and it is fullproof!. My family was impressed and commented on how "I really knew the art of kneading dough now", they had no clue this was the easiest recipe I've ever made xD Anyway, thanks for the great recipe
Hey J.J. ! I just put my NO-KNEAD ARTISAN BREAD in the oven hoping a waiting for a beautiful J.J.-ish result , I'm so excited ! if this works , I'll save from paying five dollars a loaf . You see, I've become a ,( Shh ), bread snob .  Alonzo
I thought your enthusiasm over the rolls was a bit much, but when these come out of tmy oven brown and perfect on the first ever attempt at rolls, I danced around the kitchen.  Thanks for a great video to launch my roll baking career ! ! !
We had unexpected company for dinner yesterday!  I had some rolls started, so I made the turbo style hot rolls.  I then grilled some small hamburger patties on the electric grill on the patio and we used the rolls to make sliders.  Everyone thought I was a genius for making sliders can you imagine?  They were amazing on these crisp rolls.  The meat I basted with my BBQ sauce while grilling them.  I topped them with shredded cheddar and put them on the rolls.  People added condiments as they wanted (Relish, lettuce, tomato, pickle, chow-chow, jalapenos, and cole slaw were all options for toppers).  Unexpected company became a slider party and I didn't have to kill myself cooking.  1 or two of these were enough for the hardiest appetite.  I had chips and tater tots for side options.  I was so glad I had my dough already rising when people dropped by. I just had to bake the rolls and cook some small patties and put everything on the table so everyone could make their own.  We had a blast in the back yard.
I've now made these several times and have played with it.  If you add a little sugar, the bread will have a slightly softer texture inside.  If you paint the rolls with egg wash (1 egg yolk with 1/2 tsp water) and cover them with sesame they had a softer crust and the sesame was delicious with the bread.  I've also added Romano cheese to half and shredded cheddar in the other half.  These I basted with egg wash and put on sesame.  My husband and I had these with salad for supper last nite and they were delicious.  I baked a turbo loaf in a cast iron skillet last nite and it  came out wonderful as well.  Sugar and fat (oil or shortening or butter) make your bread softer like white bread.  We decided this week I will bake all our bread instead of buying bread at Kroger now.  The Turbo bread or the rolls make amazing garlic cheese toast as well.  I've also added roasted garlic to some of my rolls along with parmesan.  who needs garlic toast when you can have bread seasoned with cheese and garlic?
Lovely video! I like all the cheerful colors of your kitchen.
You should tell people to make sure they never add VERY hot water, or TOO hot water, because that will KILL the yeast, their dough will not rise, and they will not know why. The water should be more warm than hot. If it is too hot to hold your hand in, that is way too hot, will kill the yeast.
your videos send out good vibes. Guna be trying this recipe later. wish bread didn't have to rise tho lol. takes so long
ha ha ha. Your adorable. I so enjoy your recipes. Thanks Jen
These crusty no knead rolls are the BEST ever. Get yourself some premium no salt butter, Euro style, or Amish home churned and have it semi-softened after allowing the rolls to cool to cool a bit. Slather the butter on the bread slice and get ready for a food experience like you never had. Trust me.
what a smile in the end haha..i'm really enjoying your videos and your recepies Thank you Jenny!
this video is almost as crusty as me
Thanks for sharing your wonderful recipes and videos Jenny!
Jenny Jones you are so lovable!
I made these for dinner tonight.  They are beautiful.  My husband thought they were from the store at first.  It was easy peasy to make and they taste so good.  I love the crunchy crust.  Hot rolls make great sandwiches as well as just as rolls.  My grandmother, mother to 10, didn't make loaves, she made pans and pans of hot rolls every week and her kids took their sandwiches for lunch made on the rolls.  I will be using this recipe often.  Jenny, loved your show and missed seeing you.  Great idea to share your cooking.  I should send yuou my Italian sausage soup recipe.  fast and super super good.
love it
lol you are so fun to watch making stuff! just keep smiling!
Thank you so much. Love this!

Receptet kérem
i wondered where I knew you from.  I kept looking at you going, I know this lady.  Then I remembered your talk show after I read below the video. lol
So no knead to make these then. :P
35 minutes? Unless your oven is very big it sounds like your irgnitor might be failing.
I will certainly try this because your method is the cleanest I have ever seen. I hate sticky gluey mess!! This looks great.
Oh I forgot to ask, would it be possible to use buckwheat flour for this recipe or do you have any buckwheat flour bread recipes please? Thanks again, Jenny! :-))
Jenny, I have to say this because I have just found your channel and enjoyed your videos so much, your enthusiasm and smiling friendly face remind me so very much of Barbara Eden from the old television series "I Dream of Jeannie"!!! I do hope you like her and I would call your channel "I Dream of Jenny"!!! ;-) Thank you for your work, you are a joy to watch and I will be trying both your no knead bread recipes tomorrow. :-) :-) :-)
Now I need a piggy timer, too. :)
Bread was a disaster for me, very gooey inside. I'll try the small one, maybe it will work.
Are you trying to be funny with those teeth? Well, you succeed 😂
Can you make these with whole wheat flour?
Thanks!!
Nice recipe, sweet cook!  Great!
Hi Jenny! My husband and I are converting to a vegan diet and are looking for recipes. The problem with a lot of recipes is they use weird ingredients like tofu, vegannaise, TVP, etc. They also say stuff like, "This tastes exactly like ___!" and it really just tastes like hot garbage. We are looking for recipes with no added sugar, oil, tofu, or animal products. Please do a healthy vegan series!
Thanks
when you use active dry yeast do you activate it first then add or do you just ad it like you do in this video ?
Jenny - you are a genius
I knew I'd seen you before! Google!!!!
You r amazing jenny
MMMMMMM  YUMMI can,t wait to try thanks SOOO much 👍
MMMMMMM  YUMMI can,t wait to try thanks SOOO much 👍
One of the best bread recipe I've tried!!! Very easy to make Thank you ms. Jenny
I love your buns ;)
OMG You really Love Bread, I've never seen anyone so excited as you. Lol lol, I will be trying these, Thanks for the video :) :) :)
Thank you so much for your bread recipe I used to make my bread years ago but with problems I was not able now you have shown me a simple way no kneading Iam now almost 82yrs the saying ing very true  one is never to old to learn Thank you very much.
Jenny, I am 81 years old, from Switzerland, and have been delighted with your no knead bread recipes! Thank you so much and on top, your are such a nice person! Regards from grandmother Colette !
Great,
Dziękuję  (thank you )
hi Jenny can you please tell recepy in english  or polish ,we use diferent ovens, and cups thy all deferent  so how much is in grams?
Ahhhh - I saw your video and others videos as well pertaining to the no knead bread... and just this last Friday prior to sunset - I actually made me a bunch of buns just like this - and I never saw a video to do this until right now.  I must admit that I am a bit taken back because I thought that I may have been the originator of this idea... that is until today when I saw this video.  Thanks so much though for the video, though it was bitter sweet.  I like to also add mashed bananas and honey to the mix and about to try some shredded zucchini & brown sugar to the next batch as well... this recipe is excellent to start with as a base... a little cinnamon and raisins... wow!  Peace~
how old are you jenny
I wish you are my mom :)
I just love it.. I am trying this no knead bread of yours.. Livin the teeth ., you are so funny .. Let's hope this works.
you know, I like you so much!  too bad you aren't doing a cooking show on the food network.  forget about talk shows,  you really CAN cook!
you are soooooo funny.......carbo porn!  of course it would be like that.  bread is natures most perfect food.
Love this.. You are a pleasure to watch.. Thanks for the recipes
This recipe totally shreds - made 2 batches of these rolls & their delish...Thanks!
Happened onto your videos by mistake.  Just love them and so enjoy watching you.  I really appreciate your recipes.  Yummy and easy
impressive bread making
I love her enthusiasm.
I don't see my answer before I ask this question.  Where can I purchase the brush for egg whites?  I love your videos!!
oh my I made those dinner rolls last night....a home run...unbelievable they tasted amazingggggg :)
Just made these rolls--they are fantastic!  Thank you for the recipe!
Jenny.. How do these buns stay crunchy..? In the fridge??   Do u hv A focaccia recipe as well?
Ohh tx fr the heads up !!
I tried these rolls. It came out pretty good except the crust was a bit too hard. Is it because of the oven temp being too high. I set it at 450 but did not use an oven thermometer. What do you think?
I made them yesterday while camping. smelled so good baking,came out perfect
Can we use whole wheat flour ??
A little sugar  added  really adds to the yeast and flavor.  :)
Oh I just find this lady adorable! Love love love this!
Your Pool Boy must be crazy. I'll be your pool boy lol
Jenny, just loved your recipes!  Will try it this w/end.  Just a question, is your oven electric?  I have both, just wonder which one gets better results!  Congratulations for your videos!!!
Jenny Thank You For The Recipe , I made It As Perfect As Yours , And I Used All- purpose Turned out crispy outside & fluffy inside Thanks Again !!! :)
Dear Jenny,  your buns are amazing :) I've been making some every weekend. This weekend i had an idea i bought some mini-Motzzarella cheese balls (16 of them in the package) so when I prepared the buns dough I cut them into 16 balls instead of 8. I put one Motzzarella piece into each one wrapped the dough around it before they went into the oven. They came out even more amazing and Yummy you should try that.
Hi Jenny.... I always watched you on your tv show years ago :)  Have you ever tried making crock  pot bread? It's super simple and super easy...check it out :)  So glad I found your  you tube channel....of course I've subscribed ! :D
::snickersnort:: love the "bubba" teeth LOLOL
I love you!
I like the recipe, and I like the happy, enthusiastic presentation.  Thanks for a great video.
If a make this a little bigger and pour some clam chowder inside, do you think it would work out?
If a make this a little bigger and pour some clam chowder inside, do you think it would work out?
I love how excited Jenny gets every time she takes something out of the oven  I can tell you really are a food lover...so happy to see you again, Jenny Jenny Jenny.
Followed your instructions to the T and Made these yesterday. They were delicious and were such a big hit with my husband and friends. They had a crust on the outside, but the inside was soft and chewy. Thank you so much for the recipe. This is the best and easiest recipe for some home made crusty rolls.
I've baked sourdough for years. My starter is now 12 years old, but do keep a jar of yeast in the fridge for those rare occasions when I need to make a yeast bread. So I made a batch of the no knead rolls. I wasn't too happy with the results.  For the second batch I used 1 tsp of yeast and cold water and let it proof overnight. Much better results. The 3rd batch I divided into 4ths and I was very pleased with the results..
You solved the biggest problem with sticky sourdough:  getting the dough from risen to bakin'.  Parchment Paper!  Genious.  I have watched famous cooks the world over (YouTube) do it, with forms, years of practice, but my kitchen and me only know basic and beginner.  The Paper made me subscribe.  I was going to say you are full of humor and personality, cute too... but the heck with that!  Who wants to be number 277 to say the same old thing?  Glad I found ya Jenny.  ["...carbs: you can watch it, but you can't have it!"  You're a riot Alice!]
PLEASE UNDERSTAND if I don't answer your questions. I can't keep up any more with the number of people who view my videos and recipes (40,000 people a day in 190 countries!). So please look for answers online or in the comments here and on my website (www.JennyCanCook.com). Many questions are addressed on my website and I don't allow any ads. I am a one-woman operation. Thank you.
love ur recipes, attitude and colorful kitchen :3
Thank you Jenny. I love bread with a crust and this really fills the bill. I did the quick 3 hour version and it is better than any of the knead breads I have ever made. This will be my go to recipe when I am craving home made bread hot from the oven. By the way you are very cute, your husband is very lucky. "Jenny CAN cook"
Is it possible to double that recipe?  When we have get togethers I have a large family of bread eaters.  I don't think the one batch would be enough
Can it be made into a  "baguette"?
Thank you, your enthusiasm is contagious.
I was ready to declare this recipe a failure for me. After leaving the dough overnight in my admittedly cold winter kitchen, there were *no* air bubbles visible on top. Nevertheless I grappled with the annoyingly sticky dough according to your instructions. The dough was too sticky to form into balls so I just dropped dollops on the baking paper. Then I put them in the oven just to be able to say I had tried. I expected rock hard results that would be thrown away immediately. I couldn't believe my eyes when the rolls turned out fluffy and spongy inside and crusty outside! Not as picture perfect as yours, but we had them with butter for breakfast while still hot and they were delicious!  The hardest part of this recipe was cleaning up the sticky work surface and utensils! GREAT RECIPE! THANKS JENNY!
I love you so much.. Of course your recipes too💖✌
really good, hope can learn more from you. subscribed.
Suggest you may need a new oven if it takes 35 minutes to come to temp. Mine takes three.
...Or, you add more flour at the beginning to make the dough less sticky and easier to work with.
first time I made it my hobby and daughter loved them, so I think I will make it everyday for dinner yummmmmmmy thanks
You look so cute. Thank you for the recipe.
thanks nice big smile you are funny
thanks for sharing, I guess I will make my first bread. thanks to you Jenny
Thank you Jenny.  I will be making your spaghetti along w these rolls this weekend. I wish you would tell me where you get your colorful kitchen equipment.  Looks so pretty and seems it would add so much joy to cooking:)
Jenny, thank you for sharing your recipe YUMMMM!!!!! best crusty bread i've ever baked my husband is a bread man and he loved them!
You really are a  delight ;-D  Many thanks  for  the  informative  entertainment...
You are so gorgeous. I will try it
Hi Jenny   you are awesome.   Thank you for a great experience with making bread, Liz
YOU CAN STUFF INSIDE FETA CHEESE MIXED WITH PARSLEY,BLACK PEPPER. IN TURKEY WE PUT YOGURT INTO DOUGH MIX ALSO.
I just made the dough, but I'm a little worried about how dry it felt and looked after I mixed it with the water.  I'm letting 'it rest for the 3 hours now, but I'm just wondering if it will turn out "loose and bubbly" like it's supposed to. We'll see.
I think i did something wrong i use converter cus i use grams and ml i did have 300ml water and 300g flouor my dough was very wet so i think i use wrong converter i dont know can you wright how much grams and ml you are using please
What would be the positive or negative if I had a tray of water in the oven? While baking....and what temp would you recommend if I use my convection option on my electric oven....??
Yum,yum,yum. Looks so good. How do you make these into sour dough buns?Than you. God Bless.

Very nice of you to share your skills....... Thanks!
It's so nice to see you again. I wondered what you have been doing. You have not changed. Your bubbly personality has not changed. It's a joy to see you enjoy cooking.
You are a great cook and I guess you just calm me down. I really enjoy watching you. Thank you! Where can I meet a girl like you?
I can't wait to try this but I'm following a specific diet where I can't consume yeast :( . Can I still make this type of bread without yeast perhaps ?
Jenny,have you ever made  "Miners Rye Bread"? I was raised on it in Minersville, Pennsylvania. Enjoy your love for cooking and baking. Lovely job lady.
Hi Jenny， the highest temp of my oven is just 250, can't reach 450.  Is it still ok to make it crispy？
the tea towel, dry or damp?
hi, this looks good!  do you think the egg wash before baking would work with a little bit of Himalaya salt sprinkled on top?
YOU ARE SO DARN CUTE!!!!!!!!!!! I ABSOLUTELY ADORE YOU & ALWAYS HAVE!!!!!!!!!!! ☆☆☆☆☆♡♡♡♡♡☆☆☆☆☆
Very charming, Jenny - The video and you.
thnx Jenny
Hey Jenny ...can i use sourdough starter yeast instead of market available yeast ?
Thank you so much for this, Jenny! I am a great cook, but not a great baker (because I'm more of a dumper than a measurer, haha, but also because I always worry I am going to add too much flour when all the bread recipes say "add more flour till it's smooth & elastic & knead 10 mins" and stuff like that!). I have wondered about covering the dough with a tea towel... doesn't the dough stick to it? My grandma always made buns & she still had the old flour sack tea towels she only used for baking (I bought some new ones that are the same fabric, they're still new in the pkg, because I rarely bake, but I am trying to learn! I bought them new, because I have 4 cats ... and I'm sorry but no matter how hard I try, fur gets on the normal towels which then gets onto the dough.). I made an artisan type of bread a few weeks ago, that required a "Poolish", and I made it to test the yeast.... anyway it required 3 sets of kneading & rising & reshaping and I had covered it with parchment instead of a towel, and so much of it stuck!  (although I should have baked it after the first or second set, because it didn't rise on the 3rd one.) Anyway ... I'm going to watch more of your videos and I subscribed, maybe I can be an okay baker, lol. Also going to check out your website! Thanks again, Jenny!
i just made the buns and they taste so good and its my very first succeed .thank you for the best recepi . i m making other now yummy.
Hi Jenny, can I leave the dough over night after I mix the hot water with the dry ingredients?
May I ask: what temperature does your kitchen have? Thank you. :-)
Hi Jenny do you think whole wheat flour would work for these rolls?:)
Your a joy to watch. I can just see the beam in your eye as you cook. Its a real delight.
thanks   jenny-   pls   show  how   to   fix   good   and   soft   cornbread
can  I  make  cornbread  using  the   same  receipe?
i  am  going  to  make  wholewhaet  for  the  first time- just   wish  me   luck
Great video, thanks
no sugar Ms Jenny Can Cook? i think yeast needs sugar to become alive after putting hot water? and one more thing ...the hot water...it will kill the yeast! it should be at a temp.around 100 to 140 degrees
Jenny love your videos...  I made this bread just like u said but it's still raw it's awesome on the outside but the inside is gummy... Please help me...
woow  thank you. I never make bread because theK needing part. May I ask what kind of flower are you using? and the yeast? what type of yeast? Thank you I love this recipes.
I love Jenny!
Jenny, you not just cook good, you also very friendly and beautiful too :)
Jenny I just tryed doing the buns ... I Love bread as well but They didn't expand or nothing They stayed flat n spungy ...I did exactly as on your YouTube video I used all purpose flour....I so was looking forward for Some fresh buns ....
Whoa...those hair ties matching her blouse is like fleeked to fuck! Dang Jenny! Thank you for this beautiful recipe, I can't wait to make it! You're the best!
i gave up and made it into a round loaf, baked for 30 mins.. very nice...
Won't the hot water kill the yeast?
Jenny, you are so crazy!  I love watching ALL your videos, not only do I learn so much, but your sense of humor is wonderful and refreshing!
love it
Hi Jenny!  Have you ever heard of Saf-instant yeast?  In my opinion Saf is the best.
why is my bread flour,yeast,salt, water,not as loose as yours.thanks
Could you please make a video on no knead baguette?
Love your excitement, even though I'm not even cooking I enjoy your shows so much.
that was wonderful.
Hi Jenny,You did mention that we need to prove the dough for at least 3hrs.  I'm from Malaysia and the weather is rather hot over here.Would a longer proving time change the texture of the bread?Thank you  & looking forward to hear from you soon.
hello from japan!  WE LOVE YOU, MISS JENNY!!!!!!!! you just make cooking so fun. you will make a great cooking show host. pace is great, not tmi and you have the skill to impart confidence to beginner cooks like me. love it when you get excited by your own creations. so endearing. mom is also a fan. btw, your polish donut recipe works so well. done that seven times already!
hahahha you always give me a good laugh and an excellent recipe !!! Thank you so much Jenny ..i absolutely love your videos!!!
You are so hilarious Jenny!
Oh my... for reasons I cannot understand, it is impossible for me to find rolls like this in the local grocery stores.  They're all soft, with no crust at all.  I have never made any kind of bread before, the closest I have come is using pre-made pizza dough (which I did for the first time, oh, 25 minutes ago... time to get that out of the oven... wow that looks and smells fantastic!).  I am going to give these rolls a shot though.  I imagine they would go perfectly with some pasta with a tomato-based sauce.
Another wonderful recipe, thank you so much!
Hi Jenny! I am now doing these rolls - with walnut and cranberry added. Great recipe, thanks! But I have to say one more thing: I just love how happy you are while baking these, it is so easy to see how much you love baking, especially these rolls! You put a smile on my face while watching! ^_^
You are just the sweetest happiest person! - I love watching your videos!
Brilliant.  Thanks Jenny - I would marry you but don't think my wife would let me.  :-)
I've used 3 cups of flour, and 1.5 cups of 'as hot as the tap can produce' water, but my dough does not look "mushy" like yours at all - its a firm little ball. Did I "stir" it too much before resting?
Jenny, could I put this in a warm place and get a quicker rise than the 3hr initial rise time and it still be as good as yours? Luff your videos BTW.
I can't believe I'm learning to make bread from Jenny Jones.
I made these and they were good however the dough was very dense inside, not light. How can I make them lighter??? I want to make them again
This looks delicious! Thank you, Jenny! I really like your little presentation.
This is awesome! Thanks Jenny. You rock!
If this is the same Jenny, who used to have a major TV talk show, late last century (wink), YOU LOOK MARVELOUS!!!!!! Love this bread recipe. Will be trying it!!!
Can you make bread using only a stove or plain steamer?
Maam can i put some sugar?
I just recently came across your channel and i'm loving it. It's entertaining and easy to watch. No complain here. Just keep uploading please. God bless you Jenny.
Hey Jenny! Your videos are my favorite recipe videos! Can I shape this recipe into a baguette form instead? Should I bake it at the same temperature and for the same amount of time?
Could I put the dough in a loaf pan instead of making the rolls?
Hello Jenny! Thank you for posting your lovely videos, they are great! Today I tried this recipe for the second time. The first time didn't work at all. I believe the water was too hot. Today it came out quit good, especially the crust, delicious! However, the inside/crumb was a bit spongy, didn't like it at all. I am using all purpose flour as I couldn't find bread flour. Do you think this have caused the imperfect crumb? Thanks a lot. M.♥
great videos, beautiful personality and beautiful Jenny... thank you
hahaha i didn't see those teeth coming! this is such an easy recipe I can't wait to try it! thanks Jenny!!! I'm your big fan!
You scare me Sorry but it's true
Lmao
I think I just fell in love a little bit.  Can I come live at your house?
Jenny is adorable
jenney you are lovely and I love to watch your shows
can you use self rising flour instead of yeast and all purpose flour
I am making these right now. They are half way through their three hour resting time.  I love your recipes and your videos.  It's like going to culinary school. Thank you, Jenny. Xoxox. Karyn
An easy way and you figure fun. Thank you
I like this recipe and can't wait to try it ~ seems so easy as Jenny said.  She's too funny and always happy....I like that....love those teeth, she made me LOL.
Luv your sense of humor ;-)
Hey, Jenny, you forgot to spank your dough this time. I guess I'll have to spank your hot buns once they're done .
Works with wholewheat flour?
Jenny I just luv your videos, you make it look so easy and you are so happy! You ROCK!!! Thank you so much for helping me become a bread baker. I have always wanted to but was scared of yeast breads. My hubby and I both are luvin' it.
Love it,cooking made fun not a chore.Oh and you are nuts.
Jenny, you are too much......i mean you are funny. I love your recipes....keep em coming.
hi!jenny can you make a breakfast for mom's for valentine day.im her daughter kenisha pls. can you make it i love your all videos.
Yummy recipe and such a pretty smile!
Hi jenny, i just got back from a cruise and they had the most wonderful asiago cheese rolls, if i use this recipe and add some shredded asiago, should i do it before baking or at the very end just to melt it, i am afraid the cheese may burn, let me know what you think, thanks!
Hi, I am new to baking and I have followed your recipe measurements to the letter - but the mix is not loose (quite dry almost a ready to knead dough). Can you tell me what I might be doing wrong with the measurements  2 1/2 cups flour and 1 1/4 cups hot water ?
what happened to the sesame seeds
Can't wait to try this! Love your videos! Love your kitchen utensils! Where can I get some like them! I Love all of the colors!
1st time i make bread and is delicious! can i add nuts and would i need to change the recipe a bit? Thank you!
Thanks! Love it. Love your smile too! ;B
These will be great at Christmas dinner! Love your channel :-)
Jenny, I love you!  Your receipts are great/and so are you!!
This is the easiest bread dough recipe I have ever made.  Not only easy but delicious also.  I love the hard shell and soft inside.  Thanks so much for sharing.  Dave
I've watched a lot of 'how to' clips on youtube, but rarely has someone made me laugh with their happy, infectious personality. Thank you, Jenny Jones and yep, I subscribed.
Oh my gosh, why didn't I know about your channel until today lol?  I made these today with wheat flour and they turned out perfectly. You are now my go to spot for baking recipes, plus, you make me laugh!  Thank you Jenny!
Thanx for your video!  :D How long are the buns able to eat (durable? I don't know the english term for this... ;-) ?
Love that smile at the end.
Again you did it, you made me laugh loud.... No knead bread is so amazing and forgiving recipe, that's how I make bread at home, no fuss, no huss, just give the dough time to rest and rise and next day oven it goes and then enjoyment. Btw, your timers are cute, funny and colorful
what is the advantage of bread flour?
LOVE IT!!! thanks.....
I just discovered your channel and I am glad I did : )  I also love homemade bread and I am always searching for recipes I haven't tried yet. I can't wait to try these ones and I will let you know how I did it. I get as excited as you do when I bake lol  Thank you for sharing : )
I tried this today, and totally failed.They turned hard as rocks...I will try again!!!
Can you please show us a date square recipe??  I cannot find a good one for the life of me
مرحبا اريد المقاديروشكرااااااااااااا.
sprinkled rolls with Italian blend seasonings. very good.  also we have used pretzel salt.  amazing.  really easy.   you can rush these along, too.  i've made them in less than two hours with rapid rise - just set in a warm place to rise.    always good artisan style bread that you pay twice the price in the bakery dept.
Hi Jenny I used to watch some of your talk shows years ago and now I find you cooking. From a old guy here in Canada you still got it girl. I signed up and love your videos.
I'll be trying that recipe this week!  Looks fantastic!  I love rolls and the possibilities are endless!!
thanks i like it
I love your videos,    I like those duck and pig timers.  Do you have a video to make croissants?    Thanks  :)
Great show, Jenny. I get the impression we're neighbors and just sharing. You keep it light, funny and simple. Thank you!
omg jenny those teeth !! hahaha , that was awesome !  I use to watch you on your talk show all the time,  now to find you on youtube (my fav site btw)  was very exciting.  I love bread to, and love baking, gonna have to try these.  Thanks for sharing !
Such a likeable and a talented chef. I will suscribe!!
Looks yummy!
LOL Love the ending! Rolls look good, will try!
I recently subscribed to your channel. I like your videos, though I'm not a cook (albeit I should really become one). It's mostly because I used to watch your talk show when I was in high school many years ago and I've been feeling nostalgic for the past. Thank you, Jenny, and I hope you make more videos here on youtube.
Jenny, Jenny who can I turn to? Remember that song. Hey you should a TV show! I wasn't able to watch to many of your talk shows because I was on the road playing a band. You know, these videos are a lot more personal. It's you and me and well millions more but what the hey! You still got it girl. Great videos! Please make millions more. Thankz!
I have to hand it to you, Jenny. Your videos are amazing!
Yum!I love bread as well. So of course, I will be making this as soon as I get some white flour. Thanks=).
I bet it must be a royal pain to have viewers ask "can I substitute this for that", or "can I leave out.....", but I have to do it anyway.  I'm trying to reduce consumption of white flour, so I would like to make myself some whole wheat bread. My question is, would I have to change anything, like amount of yeast or water, if I use whole wheat flour? Thank you!
You are such a good teacher & make cooking fun! Love your  videos!
Jenny I LOVE YOU!!! So glad I found your channel. Seeing you brings back so many memory's of late night television in my early 20's. Glad to see you're still making great videos. I discovered no-knead bread about a year ago and love making it all the time. Just mixed up a bowl of rosemary garlic focaccia dough tonight.  Cheers!
hi jenny! how much water do you put in to them and can you make a vid on making perfect fries
Jenny i love ur videos so much! Ur so funny and likable like i wish i knew you in real life lol i need to try this recipe out!
05:49 Jenny, you're just like your buns, HOT!  :DD
I'm helping Jenny Jones no need to knead buns video. The only difference between rapid rise yeast and dry is that your doughs will rise in about half the time. And there is the potential for over rising (just tell your friends you were making ciabatta bread if that happens). I never heard of that before. But then I never heard of negative interest rates. Both will leave you flat. Really nice smile, Jenny. My birthday's Halloween. Loved it!  :)
I also love bread! Bread and butter! YUM! The rolls look amazing and I just love your humor! You should have your own cooking show! Thanks for sharing Jenny! Take care :)
Hi Jenny! Thanks so much for sharing. I can't wait to try another great Jenny recipe. Any particlar reason you don't add sugar for the yeast? Does it taste better without this? I look forward to more videos!  Emily
Wow! It looks so good and easy! I have an electric oven. Will that work as good as yours? Help!
Fantastic bread rolls! Thank you
So easy and they look delicious!  Lol...I was waiting for the funny part and you didn't disappoint, Jenny!
Hi Jenny! I love crusty bread, too! Thank you so much for this easy recipe! Love your videos!  ~Angie~
