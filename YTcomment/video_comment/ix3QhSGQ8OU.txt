What do you do with a wife when you go into the back yard and she is using your Ax to chop up hard dirt ? Just shake your head and explain what the pick ax is for.
1:17  Awesome
Exact way i sharpen axes .spades.mower blades.it works a treat.
What kind of wheel did you use?
I use this method and recommend using a used flapper disk for it.  They remove material more slowly making it easier.  I always keep my used flapper disks for this instead of tossing them out.
You're grinding with a jug of nitro cellulose on your bench????
Nice Scottish Axent.
Lol... everyone in the section comment has "Tips" for the man in the video... yet they have clicked a "How to Sharpen your AXE" video... that is Irony at it's best. Great Video in my opinion. I have an old AXE I will try a grinder on
That method also works on shovel edges (sharp shovels cut MUCH easier!), mower blades (I haven't needed my bench grinder in years), picks, and similar.
Where's your eye protection. Got to keep them safe. Good video though.
I would start 120. Once youngrind it off, you can't add it back on. It will take longer with finer grit, but less likely to screw up.
Do you worry about wrecking the tempering?
