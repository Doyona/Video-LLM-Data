What a cutie ... Bryce. Kids love mac n' cheese. Guess I'm just a big kid.  LOL!
An Italian spin on Mac N Cheese? LOL Italians invented the dish.
I love her show but mac and cheese without cheddar should be illegal lol
This is how I always make Mac and Cheese. I can't stand putting it in the oven because I fine it drys it out. I always use Muster and White Vermont cheese.
I love this show to but gratis boat. Cheese
Once she added (lots of) black pepper... I screamed "NOOO". Anyway, i'll still try to make it at home. Thanks Ree for sharing this great recipe! I have been drooling since you melted that glove of garlic
Okay..... but what do you do with that WHOLE glove of garlic?!?!
Cheese 🧀
one uncrushed clove of garlic
Who loves this show ✋🏻 only me?
Substitute the macaroni with steamed cauliflower and or broccoli and it would be legal for low carb diets like Keto, Paleo or THM people!
Don't like parsley
Looks yummy. But hate garlic
Nothing says "Italian" less than this recipe. Nothing in that has to do with a 4 formaggi - especially garlic. I'm totally fine with what she does, she could throw anything into that sauce. But do NOT call that thing "Italian Twist"
What about the garlic clove did she already take it out before adding all the cheese?
the music is annoying
Ree: How do you like that Mac and Cheese Kid: it's good Ree: Yeah because I'm the PIONEER WOMAN and I DOMINATE THE UNIVERSE!!!
Reeeeeeeeeeee
That background music is so distracting.
Ree is amazing.  Haters gonna hate.
I make it this way, it taste funny to me with the white sauce.
Love mac & cheese. Hate garlic
Each to their own. All Ree  is showing you is how she does things. Don't make it if you don't like it. Make it the way you want.
Looks good. Yum!
What the heck?? I don't think she knows what  'je n'est ce quoi' means.
Goat cheese is so discusting
I wanna buy one of your books today but I can't decide which one yet.
I like the twist on Mac-N-Cheese.  I enjoy trying twists to recipes.  Maybe I will add bacon.  I think that would be my twist to this recipe.
absolute trash looks flavorless
No-Bake Mac & Cheese is blasphemous. 🤭 Unfinished...This is what I do BEFORE I bake it. This is basically cheesy Macaroni Salad.
Second.
