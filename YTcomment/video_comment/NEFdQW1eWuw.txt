My brother used to have very fine hair on top of his head, but he yet had a hairline, just very thin. He lowered his stress, improved diet, and started using liiitleextraa cocooonion shampoo & hair oil together. This helped reduce his hair fall in just 4-5 months.
❤ THANK YOU.
Hi! Mine is creating a foam that turns blue or purple. What does that mean?
Is it filtered water?
What temp do you use on the crockpot? High or low?
Do you have to  Refrigerate ?

Now a day I'm facing too much hair fall I used different types of oil but my hairfall was not stoped.please guide me can I use this rosemary spry??
I was thinking if I add a spoon of aloe Vera jel to 50ml rosemary water. Can this make my rosemary water last longer?
So u didn’t say if you leave it in after the wash or due use it like a rinse.
I am useding it
I add green tea 🍵 to rosemary water💆🏻
SO glad to know how long this stores in the fridge. I was scared mine had gone bad even though it smells ok, I wasn't sure. But now I know it has a few more months left :) Thanks!!!n I added some rosemary essential oil as well as tea tree and peppermint because they are also great for the follicles.
Pls I lost my hair texture can I use it
it gonna straight your hair
Do you rinse it off or you can just keep the rosemary water in your hair and scalp? All day till the next day?
❓BIG QUESTION: when I was boiling rosemary I noticed some WHITE FOAM forming around the pot and on top of the water. I was wondering if it is normal and safe to use??❓
How? My rosemary water goes bad after a few days???
Can we keep rosemary water overnight and wash it the next day?
Why does dried Rosemary not count?
How/when do you use this, thank you
Nice
is rosemary water/hydrosol have same power as oil ??
How much water u put
I forgot to cover my rosemary when boiling it .. did I waste it ?
Does it promote new hair growth ?
Hi 😊 first, thank you. I have a question : is it normal to lose more hair after applying the rosemary water and doing a circulation massage for 5mn ?  (For example today I brushed my hair in the morning. I lost 15 hairs. Just after that, I have applied the rosemary water, massage for 5mn, brush my hair again to do a braid, and this time I lost 70 hairs 😭 )
I think it may be best to boil rosemary for a few minutes and then let it sit in crockpot for a few hours. I believe it needs to reach a rolling boiling point in order to release many of its properties. That's why this recipe doesn't turn the water red, only greenish.
Gotta be Gen Z having to explain how a spray bottle works.  The magical mist to spray option OMG.
I have a question, can i add some celtic sea salt(healtist salt in the world with 84 minerals) in  the rosemarin water for more effect?
So just to be clear this spray can last six months in your refrigerator? I was told it’s only good for five days and have really been throwing it out every five days… omg.
Does it work if you leave it on for an hour or so and then shampoo?
Can we use the rosemary water everyday and everytime without rinse the hair?
Some people say it only last up to 5 days . Then bacteria builds up .... now I’m confused 😅
I love that spray bottle
The longer u simmer it the better
I spend most of my time at school and don't have a fridge, so how do I keep rosemary  perform from spoiling? 😢
If it's not refrigerated how long will it last outside the refrigerator.
Is this good for coivd hair loss!
You can do this exact same recipe here, but in an Instant Pot.  Same methods as presented here, but set the instant pot to steam mode, and put it on 15 minutes.  Rosemary water comes out identical to the recipe here, in a fraction of the time.    The steam mode on your pressure cooker ensures that the vital nutrients from the rosemary plant don’t get destroyed.
The rosemary water didnt turn red after boiling, is this a Bad sign? The first time I did this, it turned out perfectly red!
I have seen if rosemary water is red it means it's from unhealthy rosemary
Thanks
You should specify in your video description that you need a crockpot…. Lol. Waste of time!
Mine had like purple foam. Is that normal
Can someone tell me if that also work for dandruff and flakes ?
Des cheveux magnifiques
My scalp really tingles alot with rosemary water and it really prevents hair shedding
You were first with this. Thx
Thank you 😊
How long can I use it if I don't fridge it?
How long can we keep this elixir after making and refrigerating it?
I have mine in an airtight container for about four months do you think it will still be good for a rinse?????
My water came out dark dark red almost maroon what did i do wrong
When I boiled my rosemary white foam formed and then it turned purple and the rosemary water was quite dark. I have no idea why, if its safe to use or what went wrong :(
2:21 the crack pot 🤣
Thanks for the info......anyway u have nice lips. Thanks again.
I heat rosemary in coconut oil, and pour the slight greenish oil into bottle. It gels so refrigeration is not necessary. When ready to apply, scoop half a teaspoon of coconut/rosemary oil and add a drop of fulvic acid (for super absorbsion). Excellent for hair n skin.🎉
But how do you use it?
@lora can this be use for relax hair perm
Why 4 hours??
Thank you. I did put mine in the fridge but was concern about it’s longevity so thanks for that information.
Is better to use rosemary water or oil for hair loss? 🤗
4 hrs???  I usually bring filtered water (If tap water then boil for 20 min) to a boil turn off heat and submerge the rosemary and leave it in pot overnight.  Then put rosemary water in bottle and refrigerate.   Apply to scalp 2-3 times between wash and don't rinse it out.  Massage scalp for a couple min after it's applied.  Works great for me.
Some chamomile tea in there will make it even better
Thank you so much Queen 🌹👑🏆✨🥇💫
Is it ok if I use a normal pot on medium heat for a shorter time, like 1-2 hours or does that affect the amount of nutrients the rosemary releases?
I don’t not have a crockpot. So how would this method work on the stove?
Please let me know rosemary water stop lose hair
Is this Rosemary plant you are boiling the same plant they get the Rosemary oil?
6 months it's to long  to keep the rosemary water in the fridge.
Your cooking it for a long time iv heared from a doctor who said to let water boil once it starts put the rosemary in and turn off flame after about 5 mins you can kill the nutrients in the plant
I hate dry rosemary!!🙄
I thought it supposed to turn red?
This tea can grow bacteria not visible to the naked eye after 5 days. So freeze your extra tea or use what you can before 5 days and throw out the rest.
Excellent! I have to get a croc pot  Thank you!
Could I use dried rosemary?
Is it okay if the water is red ?
you did so good, thank you for the information
💚🌹
hey pooh can we use dry rosemary?
Why is it that sometimes the water is red and other times it looks more green?? I never could get mine to look that deep red color.
How do you use it.  Spray it and then? Leave it? Rinse it? Wash it?

I saw a tip in another video  the leftover Rosemary Water was put  in ice trays and froze it in  individual cubes this a great way you'll  be able to use the cubes for later,  and you wont have to worry about the leftover Roesmary water  growing bacteria if you dont get around  to using  it right away just pop a cube out the ice tray a warn it up for your beautiful hair !
Did you use tap water or spring water
Push it down,cover in water= submerge the plant.
How many times a week do you use it? And do you use it everyday to style your hair? Thanks for the video
you didn't mention how to use it?
I was told a month ago to try this by a loc man.. So I got the organic rosemary. He told me I'ma thank him later. 😊
what can do rosemary water to hair ... make it grow ?
So true , I use organic rosemary oil and distill water placed in glass spray bottle and I was able to stopped hair shedding ....I had a major problem of hair shedding and I had some hairline grays  that has turned darker....3 times a week it also has a hair thickener effect., I make enough for a week.
What do you do with the plant after you take out the water ?
Did you put the crock pot in high or low temp.? Thank you!
can you drink it
Great video!
What if my rosemary comes out red or dark red instead of green when it’s done boiling?
I don’t hv the fresh rosemary leaves around me. Can I use the dried ones
احد يعرف  عربي
Is that glass container the best I can buy too; and from target.
Please what is the name of the pot you used to make the rosemary water? Thank you
Doesn't that breed bacteria overtime? Why not pour the rest in an ice cube tray & just thaw the cubes when needed?
Umuhle
I seen someone add glycerine esp to his bottles ... helps hold more
It’s just making tea lol
Thanks
Does it have to be 6 hours or can I boil it in the stove in stead
Can I add castor and rosemary oil to it???
Thank you very much Lora for this video. It's the BEST. Love using a slow cooker. Just made a whole pot tonight :)
