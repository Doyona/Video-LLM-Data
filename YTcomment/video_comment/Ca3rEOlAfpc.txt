Anyone tries to put licorice and wine in my hot fudge is getting beaten.
more lockdown binge watching season 3 thanks guys
that was on my 39th b-day. I'm old. 😭😭😭
OMG I miss level up.
does it keep? Like if i make more than i use can i keep it in a squeeze bottle and it will stay liquid or will it set up?
Would a dark grape juice work as a substitute for the wine?
I learned something useful and cheffy. Thanks, lads!
What about an alternative to the red wine? Would red grape vinegar work?
Level up Barry
What is double cream and golden syrup and can you advise what to use instead of a vanilla pod?
no....sorry   I don't like fruit in my chocolate (or chocolate on my fruit)... and licorice is, frankly, just plain disgusting and turns my stomach just getting a whiff of it....so this is a stinker......just give me caramel sauce and call it done....
YES!!!
I was on board for this from the start. I didn't need to taste the posh one. When he said "licorice and red wine" I was like YASSSS PUT IT IN MY MOUTHHHH
Level up ketchup

The unexpected ingredients - this is what I come here for. That, and the laughs, of course!
Do a spicy challenge!! Do a spicy challenge!!
Level up berry

Proud of J!! 😊
I was really hoping at 4:13 that there was sauce on the spoon
Jamie you can put it on Barry I'd rather put it on Ben.
Just wondering what else I could pour this delicious fudge on 🤔
i feel like baz is the most British out of them al
3:40 "thats well posh" 😂
How many times a day do you guys put your head in that fridge?
Level up Barry’s hair.
If you can't get golden syrup what can you use?
Tried it out. Tastes fantastic, but ran into 1 problem. The sauce solidifies on the icecream. This isn't ideal. Any idea on how to keep it liquid when it cools down a little? Obviously while keeping the flavour the way it is now. Adding a lot of cream would keep it liquid, but change the taste significantly as well (e.g.).
How about hummus sweet or a creative savory one.
"Sounds like a level down" 😂
Chocolate & red wine sounds like something that wouldn't go together at all, but I've had chocolate wine that was red wine w/chocolate in it & it's *delicious*
level up an artichoke
Lmao Barry is always calling things posh
You should level up Chulent. A traditional Jewish food eaten on Saturdays mostly and on cold days.
Level up whipped cream!!!!!
what the heck is golden syrup and what can i replace it with? (pls don't say corn syrup bc that stuff is super unhealthy...)
What about a leveled up fonduta?
Uh no, I don't want any fruit flavour coming from a chocolate fudge sauce.
Ideas for you: What about rice paper week? Creative ways to use rice paper- like as wonton rappers, vegan bacon, baking them ext? Or, tofu week/tofu battle! Vegan week? Vegetable breads/cakes creative ways to use vegetables? Black Garlic recipes?

If you lads can somehow manage to level up Cheesecake, and I mean like, real hardcore New York style cheesecake, then I will be thoroughly impressed.

Would the Wine Syrup also work with Ginger Wine?
I really love how Mike describes the taste of the foods you make. Makes me feel like I can also taste the food even though I really can’t
So.. where can we find a fudge-sauce-covered-Barry?
Barry is hot
How about leveling up a quesadilla? Maybe some pulled pork?
This looks amazing! I have to try this!

Thank You Always
Whatever sauce you make, mix it with coffee and you have an insane hot beverage

Level up is by far my favorite series, I've missed it! 😊
What wine did you use?
OR for a super yummy, super thick healthier chocolate fudge sauce just melt equal parts butter, brown sugar, cocoa powder, golden syrup and water. Mix then add to the microwave for 10 second bursts until the sugar is dissolved. Can make as much or as little sauce as needed 👍🏼👍🏼 Your welcome!
you guys should level up mac and cheese
Make mooncakes :D
I love sauce made out of red vine and balsamic vinegar (reduced, obviously) and then thickened with dark chocolate ( not cold butter). best for Steaks

Or ... level up to using chocolate made from Criollo or Trinitario beans that are fruity and spicy by themselves.
please level up béchamel. This sauce is the foundation for so many dishes, that leveling it up can improve a person's entire kitchen game!
Mike's been giving really nice commentary about the food lately not just saying that they're good or delicious. Keep at it <3
That thumbnail was so unnecessary haha
Level up hot chocolate
I’m so confused it’s called fudge sauce but has no fudge what do you mean
Level up mint sauce. Then pour it on Barry.
Is it just me or is Mike looking really good recently? I’m loath to use the word but it came up in conversation- he’s pretty scrumptious right now
"That's the best level up we've ever done." My Hellthy Junk Food senses are tingling.
MASH POTATO!!!!!!!!

I’d like to see you level up old classic Rice pudding or bread-and-butter pudding
Level Up Bircher Muesli!!
I was thinking about a grilled cheese sandwich level up, but then I remembered you already did that! I was thinking brie, grilled pears and balsamic, hmmmm...! You could level up croutons and/or tomato soup, maybe? :) cold season is approaching!
Barry, honestly mate, frosted tips? what year is it?
Not sure whether this a level up but I'll throw this in anyway. When I was growing up (UK, late 60s, early 70s) , my Mum's chocolate sauce for vanilla ice cream was basically cocoa powder, brown sugar and butter, but the secret ingredient was the sugar syrup from a tin of pears. I don't know whether you can even still get canned fruit in sugar syrup, but if you can, oh God it adds value to a chocolate sauce. Has to be pears though.
Please stop levelling up delicious fatty things I’m trying to eat healthy things and gain muscles so I can join the Police AND THIS ISNT HELPING GUYS
"Augh, that's well posh" this is the quality reaction I clicked to see

Guys, is there a yellowish bar in the bottom of the videos, or it’s just me?
Ah Drippin' that red red wine.
Level up fruit salad (dessert - fruit, whipped cream and chocolate pieces)!
I was thinking  how can anyone  level up perfection  Boys you delivered  👏👏👏
(How) could you incorporate this sauce into a buttercream?
I need a Barry to put chocolate sauce on
Level Up salted caramel :D
We would like to see more things we can put on Barry please
Both look fabulous, but I don't think I can get away from my super-easy sauce:  throw chocolate chips in a cup, just barely cover with milk and microwave and stir until melted and smooth.
as someone who's made (and eaten) multiple kilos of ganache when baking cakes in her life I have to ask if this would cover a cake well
"Put it on Barry" or " Put it on Berries"???? lol
Looks lovely
Lovely
Level up Barry 😂😂😂
