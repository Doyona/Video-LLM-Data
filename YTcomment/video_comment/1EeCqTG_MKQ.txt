Yes please more bags!!!
Hi! I was just wondering if the Quilt-Smart Grid is still available?
Great tutorial! 🍁🍁🍁
I can’t find the quilts smart 21/2 grid….
Please more bags. Love them!
Please more.
I looked on your website but couldn’t identify the sticky product you used. Help!
Yes, yes more bags please. Love that bag😃😃
Super cute bag!  Thanks for sharing!💜
The best tutorial for zipper placement. Thank you! 💖
Maybe an easy cosmetic bag same way but bigger
Just got a chance to try this.  I didn’t have the special interfacing so I just used some basting spray on my sew-in stabilizer!  Oh wow!  This is life changing.
That is the craziest, coolest technique to sew little squares together!
I love the patchwork idea!
That was fusible liner that you ironed the top fabric to? does it have a number and name?
Love the bag.  Thanks so much for sharing
Great video. I'd like to see more bag videos.
Made up easy and cute.  A note the top stitching along the zipper ends up quite thick and I broke a needle, so be careful and go slow.
8
Can someone explain half an each from what point I'm stuck on that part now. Thanks.
So cute just found you. Now question if I don't want to round bottom corners do I have too?
Love love this bag!! Yes yes more bags!
why not use a small zipper
I love this little bag.  I am going to sew up a few for my daughters, daughter-in-law and married granddaughters for Christmas. Very good tutorial.  Thank you!
Would you please put some of the quilt smart fusible grid in a Sew sampler box as we can’t get it in the UK. Thanks 🙏
Try using a bar-tack or button sewing stitch to close the end of the zipper.
You’re great! Can’t lie this enough! TFS
Very nice. Your tutorials are fun and easy to follow. Ty for sharing them!
I definitely want to see more bags.  I love this line of fabric and this bag is very pretty.  Can someone from FQS please tell me how many of these bags can be made from one package of the Quiltsmart?  Thank you!
Thank you very much. I loved it.
GREAT.   PRETTY..  USA
Cute bag😊. Would love to see more bags!
Please more bags, love it........
Would love to see a larger version of this bag
Lovely tutorial!
Is there a difference between the grid panel and the Grid Fusible Interfacing Yardage Bosal? Thanks!
Thank you. Love the bag. Yes more bags, please ? Quilted bags are nice. I didn't realize how easy it is.
YES! MORE BAGS!! Love this little cutie patchwork bag!
Hello!! Great video and yes more bags, what about drawstring with lining for small knitting proyects, thank you 😊.
where is the best cheapest place to order Annie's zippers?   You are so right on about zipper foots!  LOL   You are my twin!
I love your tutorial.. thank u regret from Indonesia..💕
Love this project, great for scraps.  I love the quilt pattern in the background, could you reference the pattern/design.  Thanks, love all your videos!!!
Hola como se consigue esa entretela .gracias
More bags please.....I think I would add batting and quilting....sew show something like that please.....
I am so new to this...can I use any fusible?  If i don't have the dots do I just fold on the seam?  thank you :)   I can't find the quiltsmart here and takes a few weeks for it to come in.  Until then I would like to try this tutorial out. :)
I love your blouse. Did you make it? Great tutorial 🤗
Love this!!!!
How do I find the quiltsmart panel?
ок. 5+!!!!!!
Thanks you so much. I loved
Could you explain where exactly you are measuring from when you put the ruler down to trim? I have watched the video several times and am not familiar with on point. Thanks so much
Love zipper bags. Please do more.
yes more bags please, this is adorable!
More bags !!!!!
How many bags will one quiltsmart panel make? Thanks for the cute tutorial.
Yes, love bags and this is a great project that allows me to use up all those pretty little scraps.  Thanks!
Well done video tutorial. YES to more bags! My go-to gifts.
Very pretty bag.  Really good idea putting the squares on point.  I like to make any bags, but it would be nice to see a little handbag/purse for children.  Have a 5 year old granddaughter who loves bags of all shapes and sizes.  Many thanks
I love this tutorial, This would be a nice project for one of the Sew Sampler boxes  (hint hint)
thank you for such an informative tutorial.  i had never heard of quiltsmart before.  this could be a game changer for me.  i make patchwork bags by sewing each square together.  very time consuming.  i will be placing an order for this product.  do they make it in other grid sizes?  like for the 5 Inch squares or a 1 inch square?  i do bags with all different size squares.  the 1 inch squares are very time consuming, but turn out quite adorable, imho.
The ruler you used was that the 6.5 x 12.5 creative grid ruler?
I totally love this bag!! I’m waiting for my goodies to arrive so I can create one!!

Video is not available
I love bags, of any type. Thank you 😊
yes! more bags please! can you please create a tall, round, bag?
Are the zipper fabric pieces at the ends not sewn into the seam?  I like how neatly the zipper looks with this technique.
Loved your bag! More bag videos please!

Good tutorial.  I enjoyed it!
Great video.  Would love more bags!
Beautiful bag and easy .i would love to see more tourists.🌹
I enjoy your videos and all your cute projects. I would've like to see a close shot of the zipper finish at the end since it was an important detail. Also, I don't know if it's my computer but so many of your videos are so blown out with white that they're hard to look it. Or maybe it's just my "old" eyes!
Can you use a shorter zipper? That was such a waste of a zipper, if you only need a shorter amount, wouldn't it have worked out?
Wonderful big tutorial. Yes I would love more!!
Thank you!!! I loved it! Can’t wait for more fun bag videos!
Yes more bags in different sizes!❤️this tutorial!
Yes more bags please:)
Very clear tutorial - thank you. I've made pouches and totes and never thought of rounding the bottom corners. Something simple like that makes all the difference. And, YES, more bags!  I'd love to make a lightweight day-use backpack with straps, not strings, to use when we bike on vacation. Something pretty, fun, and not-too-hard to make!
Love It!!!!!
Love this tutorial! Love to see more bag video’s
Gr at tutorial 😍
Genius!!! Thank you for sharing your tip.
Great video! Yes to more bags please.

What sewing foot were you using ? I tired to look I think it was 37D??
Awesome! Yes, more bags please.
Love this tutorial. I have several mini charm packs and didn't what to do with them.  This is a great idea.
Adorable pouch and I love your shirt Kimberly!
Yes, more bags please! Thanks
Love it!! More bags please.
Kimberly!!!  Look at you and your awesome bag video!!!!  Great job!!!
Thank you I like more bags
When making a boxy pouch with this mini charm pack would you do the inside the same, sew the outside and inside separately and then flip them back inside? Btw this was the best and clearest explanation on how to set a zipper!!🙏🏼
Thank you so much as always you come up with simple and net ideas .
Love the bag,  Want see more bag Please.
Nice bag!! More bags please!
Cute bag Kimberly. I would love to see more bag tutorials. Thanks!
I would love for you to make a bucket style knitting bag with drawstrings😁❤️
Nice quick lil bag! Maybe all the ingredients could be in a sew sampler box one day!
With love from Russia!Very beautiful bag.I'll sew it myself.
I've seen this patchwork method before and always wondered what would be a good project to use it with (as it seems pretty "stiff") - Love this idea!!! The By Annie zippers are so clever, too! Thank you for the full tutorial, Kimberly!
Love this little project! That grid panel is a really clever idea to make things move fast too!
