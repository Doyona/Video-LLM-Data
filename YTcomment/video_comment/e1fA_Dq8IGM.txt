I enjoyed your videos. I'm going try it now. Thanks for sharing this content.
Hi John made your whole meal bread several times but can’t get a light crumb dence a heavy ? Followed process as per your instructions?
Hi John, thanks for your lovely videos. Can you tell me what brand of Grain Mill you are using please, I don't see it stocked on your website? Thanks 😁😁
John. Thank you for the bread video. please take care. Richard
I did this bread and was so easy with the brilliant instructions you gave . Look forward to trying some more of your recipes .
well, today's the day! it's on it's 1st proof, with 19.5 mins to go!
This is my favorite video thus far as you give educational help as well, explaining why this bread is healthy and also full of vitamins most of us are likely deficient in.  Thank you for taking the time to make this so that I can learn.  I also appreciate that this doesn't require a starter.  God bless you! ❤
Beautiful 😊🎉
oh thank you, Chef.. my fear is gone! thanks for not using a stand mixer, as not everyone owns one. my kitchen is the size of a postage stamp! prior to your vid, i watched a woman who also had the same grinder. being a professional, you get straight to the point.. others get too "wordy" and make me nervous and impatient . no one told me to wet my hands,..way better than to get skiddish about adding"a little more flour,.. how much is too much?? you gave me clarity. i'll be sure to let you know how it goes!🤗
Can I use whole wheat flour?
Hello John, enjoying you bread making series, would this bread be suitable for twin basket air fryer Nija similar to one you used, regards Reg South Wales. Good work
Your videos are great, that's 2 I've done and they've both been great  Thankyou
Hi John. I make this recipe a lot. It is delicious. Sometimes I have it plain with garlic butter. When I stay at a farmhouse I mind, I cook the bread in their wood fired stove. It seems to have an extra crispy crust done this way. 😋
So glad I found your channel❤❤ Thanks for all your videos. Fantastic what you did.
I am about to pull this load from my oven in about 5 minutes. I may or may not have the will power to wait until it cools down to try a piece. 😂
You are now officially the go to chef for me when looking for recipes online, especially your bread.  Am going to make this recipe today.  As I have already thought about milling my own flour and have already purchased a sifter, after watching this, I am now determined to make milling my own my 'project' for the upcoming winter, just have to purchase mill.  Thank you so much for your delicious recipes and inspiration.
New subscriber here watching from the UK 🇬🇧  ❤
I've made hundreds of loaves of Artisan Bread, (I give most of it away), and quite a few loaves of regular bread. I've watched countless bread videos. I have never seen anyone use water on the counter instead of flour. There are some that use copious amounts of flour and I've been turned off by it. I will make this bread later today. I'm really looking forward to trying this. It may be my new normal. Thank you for this.
Hi, Do you sell the milling machine?  Or do you have a link to where it can be bought?  Thanks....  Anne from East Yorkshire in the UK
I am from Bangladesh watched your Vedio without fail .,Thanks.
Hi john please can you tell me where to purchase the flour mill that you used in your video Many thanks
John, I've made some of your recipes. They're really helpful and easy to do. I'm interested in if you don't mind making a video of sourdough 100% whole wheat flour bread.. Is there any specific taste if we use whole wheat flour more than white flour? Can't wait for your next upload. Thank you, John.
Thank you very much  I will try this looks great😊
Thank you  definitely going to try this.
Ive made this loaf today. I dont know what i did wrong. The bread did rise but when cooked it felt heavy. It tastes stodgy too. Im so disappointed i really hoped it would work out
This may be the prettiest loaf of whole wheat bread I've seen on YouTube, and I've watched countless bread videos. I've tried various recipes and not been satisfied. Can't wait to give this one a go! Oh, and your improvised proving box is genius!
Hello John, thanks for the video. I have a quick question. My bread somehow cracked open on one side near the top. Do you know why that is the case? Thanks!
This is so easy!!!  I love it.  I've spent years making bread, kneading by hand, using a large mixer made specifically for kneading dough, and a bread machine. I'm hooked.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!
Mr. John,  hope you are well. I’ve been baking many of my favorite recipes you’ve shared. It’s been about 12-13 years now. There are no words that can adequately express my sincerest thanks for helping me begin the wonderful bread making journey. My family are equally grateful.  I’m teaching my niece to make bread in a Dutch oven. We made pizza dough a few weeks ago too. 😊😘🤗  Is it possible to fashion a bread proofing box using a heating pad?
😊
I’m making this. Thank you so much
Ignore my comment about sugar as I have watched video from start again 🫣
Am I missing something as I can’t see where the sugar in list of ingredients is added? I’m assuming it is added at same time as salt.
"Using a proving box gives you more control" ... "OK, I had to reset the timer because it was rising faster than I had anticipated". 😅
"Kosher" salt? Didn't realise you were American.
Wonderful! Thank you so much for this excellent demonstration. Very helpful.
I have been making this bread but 1/2 teaspoon yeast overnight rise. Really helps develop the flavour and texture I think.
great video. I would recommend avocado or coconut oil over vegetable oil for sure.
Tried making a sourdough starter in a fresh and clean glass container twice but each time it developed a white film on the top after 3 days ,where did i go wrong
Hi John, just stumbled on this video and can't wait to try out your recipe but would love to know the brand of your flour mill. This is an old video so Im hoping against hope you still check back on some of your old video's from time to time. I love watching everything you make. I know your a pro since you make it look easy!😉
I've found the perfect bread recipe that I've been looking for.  Your instructions made it very easy for me to follow you, I did exactly as you said and showed, and finally - finally ! - just what I wanted.  Thank you so much.
Making this right now! I've been following your no knead recipes and baking my own bread for around 9 months now. I've learnt so much and the bread is fabulous! Thanks :) Victor...
I am NOT a baker...well I am now 😊😊 Thankyou for a simple and successful recipe for novices like me!🎉
Hello John, fantastic loaf. I made it today all by hand, it looks just like yours 🙂 and tastes so good. Thank you for this recipe it will be a go to for me now. Cheers.
Hi John , well , looks like you can teach an old dog new tricks after all 😅 I'm a 67 yr old mum/nan and love this recipe . Few questions please John ? Can you add seeds to this recipe and if you can , what point would be best to add ? Also , how long does it stay nice and soft , for maybe sandwiches ? Guessing great for toast too 😊 can you freeze it ? Thanks so much for your great video John , you took me back to the 60's in the kitchen , cooking with my lovely mum 😊
This looks SO good! I grind my own Kamut (Khorasan) grain. It’s the only kind that agrees with me, so it’s all I keep on hand. Will this type of wheat work in your recipe?   Thank you!
I’ve had 4 or 5 good results, but now the sticking to the tins. Do you have any advice on stopping that?
Hi John, awesome videos, so informative and relaxing to watch! I've been making your ciabatta for a few years now (Covid times!) and everyone loves it! Gotta try this one next definitely.  Three questions please, where do you by the machine that turns the wheat into flour? Where are your heat proof gloves from? And your timer too?  All great products, which I've never seen before. Your help would be appreciate, if you have time, of course.  Thank you for such wonderful recipes.
Just made this one, John. Wonderful taste. Thank you.
I've just tried your recipe, in your book the temperature of your oven is 410 F but in the video it is 375 F is there a reason for this. By the way your bread came out perfect. Chris
Beautiful thank you John 😊
Shower cap , never would if thought of that .
Hi John, I'm eager to try this as I've just milled my first wholewheat corn, I don't know what corn it is though. I have a question if I may, my yeast is allinsons and it says mix with dry ingredients not in water but I cannot find any otter type of yeast. Do you think I could mix it with water John. Cheers Gary
Thanks John, that part showing a cross section of a grain was quite educational!
Can I use whole wheat flour instead???
Thank you so much. Love your recipe and video. I'll definitely try this tomorrow. 🥰🥰🥰
Thank you John I'll give it a go
Another great bread recipe John. I’ve just sent you a little something by way of thanks for all your hard work in producing your excellent videos. They’re so easy to follow, your delivery is spot on and I get delicious bread at the end of it, what’s not to like ?😊  ‘Top Tip’? I use one of those  1 cal ‘spray light’ gizmos from Aldi to ‘grease’ my baking tins, nice and easy, no mess and it seems to work   All the best,  Richard.
What a beautiful looking bread. Love the idea of the dough proof box. Thank you.
Thank you for sharing 😊
Just tried this and didn't preheat the oven, unfortunately it stuck in the tin. Managed to salvage most of it and it does taste extremely nice all the same...lesson learned!
Can I use instant yeast and get the same results?  Thanks
I'm going to try this recipe tomorrow. Wish me luck!!
thank you for making this video; simply brilliant!
Hi John. Great video! However,  everthing went according to plan except for the last step. My dough is not rising in the oven. Any ideas please?
Putting the bread back in for five minutes to crisp is a great idea! ❤
Thank you. I enjoyed learning from your video -- fine instruction and good tips.  Glad to find a whole wheat recipe.  Your bread looks wonderful!  Now to try it myself.
Hi John. I love how simple your recipe and instructions are. I am little confused about the quantity of water though. What would it be in millilitres? I think i messed up the water amount as my dough is not as sticky. Please let me know.
Hi John! Love this recipe! I have a whole grain spelt flour and I was wondering if you had a similar recipe for a whole grain spelt flour?
What is the size of loaf mold?
Hey John, thanks for sending the link to this wonderful load recipe.   Made it today and it was a massive hit.  It's going to be my go to bread recipe from this day on.  Went will with the beef stew and dumplings.  If it wasn't dinnertime, I think I would of devoured the whole load in one go.   Can't wait to try some of your other recipes, thinking hot cross buns next.
I have tried this recipe - following every step - 4 times now and I love the taste but it just never turns out like yours does! It is rather fluffy, but in the first few minutes in the oven it sacks down and doesn't rise that much. and the dough is very sticky and never as smooth as yours - especially at the rolling it up-part. do you or anybody else who has tried this have any tips? thanks!
haha! For a moment I thought I was watching David Attenborough teaching how to bake a bread.:)  Thanks for sharing !
Can you make it without sugar?
We make whole wheat bread for almost 8 years now, in a totally different way but yeah: the taste is uncomparable with the regular bread that you can buy. We use all ingredients except the salt and only half of the flour and leave it for 24 hours. Then we add the salt and the other half of the flour and kneed the dough. Then we let it rise allready in the same mall as in which it goes into the oven and when it's almost risen enough then we bake for 40 minutes at 180 degrees celcius (it will grow a little bit more in the oven the first ten minutes).
This is what I am looking for. I just bought the dry bin for a Vitamix so I can make fresh bread from the whole wheat. Can't wait to try.
日本語版でお願いします❤
Anyone tried this with olive oil ?
Thank you, Sir
I'm proud to say that I've prepared this recipe so many times now that I know it pretty much by heart.
Could you please let me know what flour mill you use and a link of where you buy your wheat grains. Thank you.
One of my favorite things about your recipes is that you always list your ingredients in grams. However, in this one,  you throw me for a loop and use teaspoons to measure in a few places. I know, I know, I too can use a teaspoon. But it's just so much more accurate when I weigh everything out in grams and match your ingredients exactly. It is like no-fail..  That being said, I love this bread. And so far my wife and I are loving your milk bread and no knead white as well! Thanks a ton for all your work!
Hi John, II have taken note of your recipe but haven't tried it yet. You have received so many compliments that I don't expect it to disappoint. I'm curious about the grain mill you are using in this video. I haven't seen it anywhere else.
I made this bread and it was my best loaf ever...Thank you John!!
Does anyone know what is the brand of wheat grinder Mr Kirkwood uses?  Thanks
Can I use wholemeal bread flour?
Btw i found black wheat grain which has 18 gm protein will that do ???
Ure voice is so soothing 😘😘😘😘
The texture looks nice👌👏👏 Thank you Mr. Kirkwood🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
So easy and amazing taste. I swap out iodize Salt to sea salt and the veggie oil for avocado. Still came out amazing. Thank you for your pleasant video ❤
I’ve done this recipe 2 times now with the same results. Everything goes good until the bake. The loaf shrinks some and creates a denser bread than what yours looks like and what I’m looking for. I tried a longer final proof in the pan on the second loaf and that didn’t seem to help. I’m using a King Arthur Whole grain Whole Wheat flour with a 13.2% protein. Any suggestions? Thanks
I can't wait to try this recipe!
Have you made Cuban bread with lard? Thanks for the video, my try number 4 on wheat bread should be better after your video.
Perfect john, just perfect!
Tried multiple bread recipes and this is the easiest and has the best results. Will continue to use this for years to come.
Thank you very much for the recipe, I have baked twice during the first week and will continue to bake the tasty and healthy bread!🎉
I’m wondering when John is going to reveal himself as all we see is his hands? Interesting sideline about the homemade milled flour. Finally I’ve never made anything from any TV chefs but Mr Kirkwoods recipes and I’ve got book 4 now. When’s book 5 coming ? Great workable recipes 😇
Excellent delicious bread 🙏 where to buy flour making machine? 🙏
Thanks for sharing Chef.   Looking forward to trying the recipe.    Cheers
I used a little honey instead of sugar, eliminated the salt and it is perfect for a diabetic.
Will I get the same results rising store bought what flour?   I’ve heard using just wheat flour instead of mixing white & wheat well make a dense loaf. Is that true?
Hi John. Love every one Of your bread recipe thank you for Sharing.  I know you use a 2pound loaf pan. But Would you mind Giving the dimensions?   Thanks again
Hi John, my load didn’t rise in the oven. In fact just when I put it in the oven the top has flattened. What did I do wrong, I wonder?
This is exactly what I have been looking for! Look forward to trying!👌
Hi John, this bread looks delicious! Was wondering if a couple substitutions could be made? Honey in place of sugar, olive oil in place of vegetable oil? Thanks for a very instructive video!!
Best YouTube video I've ever seen ❤️.
❤❤❤❤
Thank you for this.
Hello John, does darkening the crust for a further 5 minutes also strengthen the sides of the bread?
Great video! Can u please tell me where I can buy the matching u use to ground the flour. Also where do I send away for the whole wheat please. Ty for everything.
your grandfatherly voice made this video quite comforting and relaxing, thank you.
I was looking on your website for this recipe.  I cannot find it at all. Would it be possible for you to put the recipe on your website?  Many thanks!
I've made this bread several times,I always watch the video because I love his voice.
John, thanks  for your generosity in helping me make healthy bread. You are the first for me to make whole wheat bread rise.  I will always think of you as the chief chef who taught me how to make wheat bread. In USA good old Alabama. It must be your high standards
Wonderful. 😊
Hello John!  Thank you for the recipe as I am going to attempt this today.  I was wondering does it matter if you use hard white, hard red or soft white?  You also mentioned making your white flour sandwich bread, can I use my soft white wheat berries in place of AP flour?
Hi nice very usefull video. Where can buy that table top flour mill pls? If you have link for rge same one pls
The first time I tried your recipe it worked great. The second time I accidently made Allison bread🤣 I proofed my dough in my multicooker, and it was way too hot. The dough didn't rise as much during the second proofing and now I have a brick that is hard to slice. I am going to enjoy it anyway. Lightly toasted it's great with butter and cheese or butter and honey. I love Allison bread
Just made this for the first time. Excellent. Your recipes never let me down. 👏🏽
Could I use whol spelt flour too?
Sir, this is wonderful bread.  The whole wheat flavor is excellent and the bread is suprisingly light. Just fantastic stuff. Thank you again.
ssjshshsh
I made this recipe following every steps but I added some skim milk powder and I used extra virgin olive oil. Everyone I know told me not to make 100% whole wheat bread because it doesn't raise. well, they were wrong! It's perfect! You can't find anything like it in stores especially with whole wheat bread. You need to try homemade bread at least once It's definitely worth it! Also, there is the benefit of being much healtier than store bought bread loaded with sugar and fat and many other things
Hi, John. I’m wondering if I should use a fine grain whole wheat or medium grain. Which is best? I’m excited to try your recipe (& your method), as white bread causes severe irregularity. Thx!
I was looking for recipes using freshly milled grains.  This looks like the answer.  I am sure it is another winner.  Every recipe of yours I have tried has been a winner.😍👍👍
i *am **_ENVIOUS_* of your counter~ the recipe is pretty good too+😂
God bless you daddy from Ghana 🇬🇭
You have such a gift - demystifying the entire process .  You have helped me make my first loaf of bread and it was absolutely delicious   Thank you so much for your time and excellent advice
Is it easier to mix it together in a glass bowl? When I do it it takes a lot more effort since the flour tends to stick a lot to the edges. Or is the spatula quality? Or the size of the bowl?
This is the best whole wheat bread that I've made. Thanks John
Hi John Thanks for sharing your recipe, I made it 100 % perfect. I hope you can share how to make Pita bread using 100% whole wheat. More power and Thanks a lot
Do you use a Whisper Mill to grind wheat berries?
can I use bacon fat instead of vegetable oil?
This is the best whole wheat I have ever made.  You make bread making so much easier.  I have a flour mill just like yours.  What setting did you use for the whole wheat?  Thsnk you so much. 😊
I am scared to try another recipe, I made someone recepe but inside the bread not cooked properly 😢why’s that
Wow, it’s so amazing. It looks very delicious and tasty!  You are very good cook.
Lovely! Thank you sir for this very helpful video on how to make a good whole wheat bread I am definetly subscribing for more
Can this recipe be used to make rolls instead of a loaf?
2:40 Wheat anatomy
...just beautiful
Thank you so much for this! I have just made this as my first ever homemade bread loaf. It was much easier than I expected, even in my tiny apartment with limited space and equipment. I will definitely be making this again and trying some more complex recipes when I'm more confident!
Thanks a million times
Brilliant loaf of whole wheat bread, thank you, Mr. John 🎉  Having made many of your recipes, I never tire of the simple step and narrative. Thank you for blessing us all with achievable step-by-step instructions. We appreciate you, Mr. John.
Made your whole wheat recipe 3 times now John, outstanding mate happy days🙂👍
Hi John, I'm just making this. Can I use spelt flour for this recipe? Many thanks on your lovely homely videos
Your years of experience taught you to make even slices. I had to buy a gadget!
Hello John, thank you so much. My name is Jeffrey from Miami. I just wanted to say that how wonderful you are. I haven’t bought your book yet but I’m going to is it in e-book or is it a regular book Physical I could buy I’m kind of old fashion but thank you so much for what you do. We always will appreciate the things you do in life. Thank you again.
Looks great! Can I replace vegetable oil with olive oil?
what is kosher salt?
Best bread making video ever.
Hey John! We have issues with this recipe that we cannot figure out. We followed the video recipe and the recipe from your bread book. Everything goes perfectly fine until we bake it. The bread will not rise and the crumb is quite dense. This is the only bread we’ve had a problem with. Any idea what we could be doing wrong? The dough rises just like it should during proofing, and our bread pan is greased well so it doesn’t stick.
Thank you for this
Looking so tasty 😋 will definitely do it :) thank you for such detailed instructions
John, I just checked the brand of whole wheat I buy and its only 10% protien?, Should I be worried ? This loaf is very simular to the Doris Grant loaf  minus the oil , I notice too you do 3 proofing sessions?
What should be size of pan
So many fine people in this world.  You are a member of that group.
Hello again I'd used the exact amount of your ingredients 😅 I think I'll be making it again to make it better but my daughter still loved it and the overall experience was quite wonderful and satisfying by Allah's Grace! Many thanks for sharing!
This is my favorite Whole Wheat recipe to date.  It's absolutely delicious & my loaf finally looks Professional. 🙂   Thanks also, for the additional education!  I enjoyed learning not just "how to" do things but also "Why" .
I have a proofing box.  (Thrift store find.).  What temperature do you suggest for the final rise?  thank you.
Thank you John for this fantastic video.  My first attempt isn't wonderful - I probably should've waited a little longer for the rise in the tin.  I used very strong wholewheat flour.   The test is in the taste though - the crumb is a little dense  in my bake, because the rise isn't sufficient, but it tastes much better than the loaf I get out of a bread machine. The most important thing is my wife loves the taste. She is not a big fan of the bread machine loafs I make, preferring shop bought. I don't like the mass produced shop stuff and the artisan bread from bakeries is far too dear.   I will try again soon :)
Thank you love this recipe. Keep teaching.
Jhon u are like the grand Father that i never had, and ur voice is very claiming and you are very clear thank u so much, i look forward to learning more! 💗✨
Excellent recipe. My first time following this recipe and it turned out nearly perfect (the bread stuck to the bottom of the pan, despite greasing it. Does anyone have experience adding seeds (flax, chia, sesame, etc …) to this recipe? If so, when to add and what adjustments to the recipe, if any? Thanks
Thank you
Very nice made
It took a lot of time for bread though it looks perfect. But I want to make homemade wheat bread maximum only 1 hour to make it ready otherwise a lot of works n the house will be pending
Hi friend it looks really delicious 🤤 First time watching your channel.Keep going friend 🙂
Your voice sounds familiar like I’ve heard it in National Geographic. Love the recipe, need to get timer and thermometer
Many thanks for this! Could we have a recipe for chicken kiev
My fav channel. Just like a bedtime story read by grandpa and some food on the side.
Looks wonderful. I can't wait to make some
What machine you used for to make wheat flour from grains I tried the recipe today it was really good ❤🎉   Thank you for sharing
In my country, two tick bread slices are called a Double-Barrel, an appreciation comment coming from your work mates.
Tomorrow I'm going to do this recipe
You are very very inspiring: you make your own butter, your own flour, all organic, all absolutely stunning in results, AND you make it all look so simple and common sense. As you Brits say, “Brilliant” I’m making your orange cake right now, but this loaf is on for this in the queue for this weekend.
Sir, could you tell me where do I buy a mill you used to make your flour?
Made a loaf today and it came out delicious!   If I wanted to make this a honey wheat loaf, do you know how much honey I would need to add? And would that mean I have to tweak the amounts of the other ingredients? Thank you for this video! It’s so easy and straightforward!
bánh mỳ nguyên cám đẹp quá , cảm ơn rất nhiều
Hello John, it’s -34 Celsius here in Winnipeg this morning so it’s a great time to heat up the kitchen!  I was just wondering if you could substitute Spelt flour for the regular whole wheat flour and if not, do you have any recipes specifically for making a loaf of spelt bread ? Thanks.
Thank you John.  I cannot wait to make it!
Hi John just made wholemeal bread fantastic!! Thanks for the tip  using  bottle water and not tap dose make a difference!!
I love this bread recipe. I make this once a week now instead of store bought bread. Thanks for sharing 😄
That's a lovely loaf
My attention was drawn to your Chanel post, and we appreciate you taking the time to share your expertise with us. ❗  We also appreciate you adding a new bread recipe to our collection of recipes.❗  In the end, it inspired me to attempt and gave me a sense of readiness, making it worthwhile to follow your "Youtube channel" because of your desire.❗:)
M
By reading the comments, I see that I am not alone, haha. This is the first loaf of bread I have ever made and it turned out beautifully. I live in Colorado so the yeast went slightly overboard and I had to fold it back into the bread pan.  But tastes great! Thank you!
Thanks so much, John. Just a question on wheat cleaning. Do we need to clean/rinse the wheat before grinding?
We are excited to try this recipe! We are also interested in the grain mill you use as we have wanted to mill our own wheat for a while. What grain mill do you use/recommend? Thank you.
OMG you're killin me John...I'm droolin....
Looks so awesome.  I can’t wait to try it.  Thank you.
Wonderful video! Thanks so much.
i love it! you earned a new subscriber here 🥰 sending love from the Philippines!
Hello John is it possible to use an all purpose flour for this bread?
That dandy flour mill is better than sliced bread.
Sub ...done
Paying near 5 dollars for brownberry whole wheat bread in USA, one day I will make my own bread
Mr Kirkwood...you are certainly a boss ...love how you explain the process incorporating texture and temperature etc..thank you for showing us the recipe...May the Lord continue to bless your hands
I will try again 🙂
Just subscribed, liked and hit the bell button. This channel is a gem! Thank you so much for sharing! More please.
amazing
What can I say! Fantastic  loaf!
Hi John, great video, how long does the loaf keep? Andrew
thank you so much John for sharing your simple recipe.   I had seen videos on this subject but yours is the friendliest.
Can u plz share the flour making machine link?
I tried this recipe and my bread is rising until I put it in the oven then it just stops, what am I doing wrong?
Thank you for all the insight. I will make this at home, I can't wait.
Hi I am from USA please inform what kind of mills u used to make a wheat flour I like your recipe I am definitely going to make and inform u again please reply thank you
I wish you would list things in cups also along with grams and ounces. I don’t have a scale. Please and thank you!
UPDATE: Just realised, I didn't put any sugar in, so I guess the yeast didn't activate. I scrubbed back through the video and you don't mention the sugar, although it does disappear from the frame,  but being a first time bread maker I completely didn't think about that :-D  Still tastes great!  Thanks John, nice simple tutorial. However, I'm not sure what went wrong (or even if nothing went wrong) but my loaf didn't seem to rise at all after going in the oven. So it's quite low, doesn't have that classic shape.
I have always been taught that one can in no way make 100% whole wheat bread without adding separate "Vital Wheat Gluten". You are the first person that I EVER saw make 100% whole wheat bread without it!
Thanks a lot, I normally those only use whole wheat flours, every YouTube video I am seeing the bakers mix with Whole wheat & White flours. Thanks again.
Hi John! I am your huge fan from Pakistan! I have mastered bread making by your videos. Would love to meet you someday!💚
Hi John,  Thanks for this recipe. Just made it and It came out great but I have a question for you.  I just got a grain mill to grind my flour but the measurements are not coming out the same as before when I was measuring by cups and by grams. Here is my problem. If I mill a cup of hard red wheat berries (approx 120g) it still will weigh 120g once in flour form but now it no longer is one (1) cup of flour but more like 1-2/3 cups instead.  So if a recipe calls for 600g of flour or 3-1/2 cups of flour which one should I go by? Any advice will be greatly appreciated. Love your video's
Nice video but don’t use vegetable oil! It’s not from vegetables but from seeds and very unhealthy. Maybe you use healthy oil but use olive oil instead
Hi John Could you please tell me how to store this bread perfectly, as not to loose it moisture and retain its life for atleast 5 to 6 days as Im the only one to eat it
Hello John, Have a question for you, I love your recipe, and I will try soon. The question is I like to add to my bred ground flax seeds, chia seeds and rye flour. Can you tell me what do I need to do to get the bread like yours, crispy but fluffy and flavorful. I make my bread in a bread maker but it's a bit too heavy. Thank you!
Very Interesting and looks tasty
Hi, John. This is the first recipe of yours I am watching. Looks awesome. I have a question. Do you measure the flour by weight or valume? The reason I am asking, I repeated everything in step one, but my dough became harder than what you show in the video. I had to use my hands for mixing. The wheat was store bought, but a good quality. Thank you.
I've made a few mushroom shaped bread loafs in the last few years.   But they still taste great.
Hello John. I learnt how to make bread from your video. Thank you very much. Please where do I buy the wheat grinder from?
You have just gotten a loyal subscriber. I can’t wait to try this out!
Let me like this video before I even start watching
Experienced voice and hands 💗
Great video; feels like pooh bear teaching us adults how to make bread.
I'm going to try this no-knead recipe now. Fed up with kneading by hand for 10+ minutes. I'll be back.
John, My wife and I love your channel, we studied this video many times before trying it out. I believe we followed your instructions exactly, but the rise was off for some reason. The only deviation we made was 2, 1lb loaf tins, versus a single two pound the bread was good but only a half rise. I have pictures of the effort. But can't find a place to post them for your to look at. I hope this finds you and yours happy and healthy. Cecil
I love your videos John!  God Bless You.
👍👍👍
Hi John!  This is an awesome recipe I have been making for the past couple of months every week. My guests and I love it. One question though: My dough is proofed very nicely after 30 min inside the bread tin. However the second I put it in the hot oven, it shrinks down a lot, like someone popped a balloon! Do you know why I lose all the size once I put it in the oven?  Thanks a lot
Wow
I’m making this today!
Hello John, could please tell me , what’s brand name of your flour Mill? And where can I order it? Looks really nice, small and less messy. I am planning to buy one . Please let me know. Thanks!!
My parents love wheat bread more than white so this is perfect and I'm so ready to make one. Thank you so much, John and more power to you!
Hello, can you please tell me where you purchased your flour grinder?  Thank you, James Petherbridge from New York City
I find if I grind my wheat just as my yeast, water and sugar is sitting, I have the lightest, freshest, flavorful - not strong tasting, whole wheat bread. Just can't beat fresh ground grains. And of course your recipe is tops!!!
I just want a big hunk of that bread covered in butter after watching that! I bought 25kg of 15% protein wheatgrain a couple of years back, when it was clear that food shortages were coming. Just need to make a grain miller now to see what the bread from it is like. Cheers!
This is what i've been looking for for 3 years now! I have tried so many ways to make a pure wholemeal that didn't come out like a brick. I tried multiple resting periods, multipe knocking backs, steam proofing in the oven, a bit like you did in the sink but none of it worked. Thanks very, very much !
heat water in microwave, pop pan of dough in and let rise. Atmosphere is warm, moist and free of drafts.
Hello John, thanks for your amazing detail and guidance. May I ask what brand of blender you use to pulverize the whole wheat? It looks really handy and safe. You are an amazing Teacher!
Loved your video. My husband  and I want to start making our own bread. Would you please tell me the mill that you are using in this video? Thank you!! 😊
I use my microwave as a proving box (off, of course) and just put a jug of super hot water inside to baby the loaf while it does its stuff....makes life easier. I do the same thing when I incubate yogurt.
Dank u zeer! Het was me een genoegen het proces gade te slaan. Bravo!
Delicious good 👍😋👌
Perfect. Very straightforward explanation. Will try it.
Thank you very much for your video. Please can you tell us what it the type of yours milling machine , It looks great ?  I wish you many more videos like this. Thank you in advance
Thanks John,I did it,tastes great
My bread got a bit stuck on the pan … a bit of a struggle to get it out !!!
This video is fantastic. I love your extra time-management tips too! A HUGE help.
Hello! What about if you use *SEA SALT*  ? Because we only have that. 🙂
I can watch Pooh Bear make bread all day
It looks little how I remember Hovis in England it was delicious!!!
Thanks again John.
Hi Thanks for sharing your recipe yummy Bread 🍞😊😊👍
John,  I've had great brilliant success making the large white loaf. However, lately, when I make the whole wheat loaf, it comes out very dense and not well-risen. The first two proofs are amazingly high and full, but the final proof in the loaf pan rises very little even though I leave it for 45 minutes to an hour. I follow the recipe scrupulously, but still it comes out dense, very unlike the loaf in your video. Any suggestions?
So full of details and information . thank you!
I just found this recipe. I cannot wait to try it! Thanks
How much day we can keep this bread
Thank you so much for this recipe John, I’ve tried so many other no knead whole wheat bread recipes, and keep coming back to yours, tried and trusted, and I won’t waste my time on any others.  I’ve found another way for that final, in-the-pan rise, a hot water bottle, half filled and wrapped in a towel, pan covered with a light tea towel.  Works well!
great video,  thank you
Looks very good, enjoy
I love your voice.
I want to try this! I hope I will very soon! thank you for sharing your recipe.
Fantastic! Thank you sir.
Thanks
This has been my first real success with bread baking.  Thank you John.  Could I add seeds to this recipe, if yes at what step would you recommend?
Hi John, thank you for your very informative wonderful videos! Could you please tell me the name of your flour mill as i'd like to try milling my own flour too.
Thanks sir much. Will definitely try it.
Looks so tasty! Thank you for sharing the recipe.
Thank you John, I love this recipe.  I had great success this morning with it.  Your videos are easy to understand and informative.
Great tutorial! I am definitely making this. What brand is your oven? It is beautiful!
What an excellent video and I didn’t even know you could mill your own flour. We walked down to our local Coggleford Mill and bought flour today. Can I ask where you got that machine from, it’s perfect?
Wonderful!
That looks great, now my mouth is watering.
Could you please tell what type of miller do you have and where sold?
I retired June 2021 and started making bread. Experimented with Einkorn, Spelt and white flour. This is my next assignment.  Love your videos John.
I'm curious about what this bread would have turned out like had you kneaded it?
So glad I found this recipe...turns out perfect each time. I have been using  butternut squash seed oil and it adds a lovely nutty flavour. I forgot the salt the last time I made the loaf and it's actually quite good...I may continue to forget the salt lol. Thank you so much for your channel Mr. Kirkwood <3
I’ll be trying this recipe very soon. With the prices of food increasing so quickly, this will hopefully become a staple recipe for me.
thank you somuch John
Thank you so much. This is undoubtedly the most comprehensive step by step easy to understand recipe I have ever seen. I can hardly wait to get the ingredients and try this tomorrow. I am a senior retired and live alone on my little farm in the mountains of East tennessee. I can hardly wait to smell the aroma of this bread baking. Please stay safe and healthy and I appreciate this so much.    (Chiefonelung)
The beautiful voice!
Teacher , thank you so much for the information, excellent baking.
Thanks John! The first I made failed. Maybe because I did not follow ur step by step procedure. It didn’t bloom right. Somewhat dense. The second try turned out divine. Absolutely fantastic! It was soft and tender from the inside. I’ve tried other wheat bread in the past they always comes out kind of flat and I thought because wheat is heavier than white flour. I almost gave up. However i thought to give it another shot and its perfect and delicious. Now me and my husband are enjoying our healthy wheat bread. 🙏❤️
Perfect recipe, makes it perfect every time thank you John
Hi John  Made this yesterday, left over night to cool. This morning, the loaf is a bit moist this morning. But fine for toast, when I did the final proof. It was ready in about 10 minutes, so I don’t know if this played a part in the moist crum . Should I cook the loaf for longer ? Or on a should I cook for longer on a lower setting? I’ve made your sandwich loaf no problem, any thoughts?
THANK YOU SOOOO MUCH for sharing this recipe! This is the first time I've made an attempt at making wheat bread because I've been afraid of messing up, also I've never seen such an easy recipe OR such great instructions given! My bread turned out wonderful! THANK YOU!!!
Many thanks from  Thailand
I tried doing the exact same thing, I don't know why my dough was sticky and not completely off the bowl as you have shown. Infact I added some extra flour and it still didn't do much of a difference. I did not go to add anymore flour, just kept it aside, let's see how it turns out.
Im about to try out this recipe, but I just have to say that this video was so soothing, his voice sounds like Winnie the Pooh, so it was like Pooh teaching people to make bread, all its missing is the big pot of honey!
Thank you ..i like it very much..im from malaysia..i really enjpy your good video..
This one works Great in my Solar Cooker too👍
I have just found your channel. Very clear and easy to follow explanation! I did my first whole wheat bread in different recipe last week but it did not turn out great. Yours look very easy to follow so I’ll definitely try it next time and thank you so much for sharing this!   I was also wondering if I can substitute honey for sugar? ☺️
👍💕Thank you. I just made my investment in my mill and hard wheat berries. My  first go at it was FAR from acceptable. I quickly realized that I needed a recipe just for these ingredients. My first loaf felt like sand paper when the dough was wet and the end product was a brick, not a loaf of bread. 😂 I'm so happy to find this recipe,  and tomorrow  I have plans to make it. Kind Regards.
Shower cap . What a brilliant idea
Loved the explanation about the grain . And I. Gonna buy the machine to make my own flour . Thankyou 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
I made this once in the Caribbean and it was perfect.  I’ve now made it twice back in the UK in my warm kitchen (I have an Aga) and both times, the dough will not rise after first mixing.  The dough feels very dry but I have been very careful to weigh everything as instructed.  I also purchased new yeast after the first failure, even though I could see that the yeast was active.  Where am I going wrong??!  Clearly, I need to just move back to the Caribbean!
Looks delicious n healthy 🙏🏼for sharing
Excellent and professional video.  Thank you the quiet music in the background.  I see you like what we used to call  ' doorstep' sliced bread.  This looks so yum.
Have you ever baked this loaf in a muffin tin?  Thought I would give that a try since I don't have a loaf tin yet. Can't wait to give it a try.  Thnks for your recipes and for sharing you knowledge.
Thank you so much for that amazing bread Sir  John. That's my favorite bread.
I must try this one . Thanks
Made this today and it turned out beautifully!  Thanks, John!!
Good job
My lovly lady is making this for us today it looks fantastic. We found our way to your channel from Basics with Babish, we cant wait to try this out and more. Thanks John and your lovely strong wife. x
That is amazing bread my goodness
Awesome video, I tried your recipe out yesterday and it came out great. You are a legend! 😁🤟🏾
Starting my yeast now... I'm really impressed with the uniformity of the crumb in this recipe...btw, the white bread loaf was really good...thank you...!!!
Hi John, what kind of grain grinder you are using? I was planning to make flour out of mung beans.
Working on my eleventh loaf of this wonderful bread now. It truly is the greatest, such a splendid balance of dense nutty whole wheat and light airy John Kirkwood style fluffy bread texture, despite this. I find it benefits nicely from a light misting of water from a spray bottle right when it goes in to bake, at the halfway "turn 180 degrees" point, and a final couple spritzes when returning the loaf to bake for the final "commando" five minutes without pan -- but then give it *plenty* of rest time on the baker's rack to steam out, unless you plan to eat it right away! The longer it sets on the rack, the more stable I've found it will be, over time. I've also had great success mixing the dough by hand, instead of with the wooden spoon back -- this dough really, really seems to love a rough, minimal hand mix, and benefits from being baked a little under-blended. Thank you so much again, John, for another truly world-class recipe from your kitchen to ours!
I found my loafs were quite dense and wanted a fluffier bread. So I’ve saved this to try! I’ve just come back after the first 45 minute rising in my airing cupboard and it’s nowhere near as risen as yours. Any tips anyone? I’ve put it back in the cupboard in hope it just needs more time. Wish me luck :)  **update** the second rise was much better and it’s the fluffiest loaf I’ve ever made!! I loved it, thanks so much :) x
Looks tasty healthy n yummy.  I can imagine eating it right now fresh. Thankyou for the recipe.
Sir, I have to say that thanks to you I was able to master this kind of bread! I did it exactly as you explained in this video and it came out awesome. Thank you very much for sharing your knowledge with the world!
Thank you, the whole wheat baguette came out great. Now I tried the whole wheat loaf and it also game out great. Had to substitute corn syrup for sugar but it still came out really good.
Finally someone who doesnt use white flour!!
Thank You so much 😊 Mr Kirkwood, for this recipe, I really Adore the procedure how You make 🍞 bread,... And Also the French Baguettes at home'☺️ I just love 😍 it. 💚 👍 👍 👍
Thank you.. I tried your bead turned out great 👍
You are the greatest chef 🙌 ❤
Very nicely done John!  A great video presentation!  Next time include yourself 'on camera' for one of your steps so we can see the cook!
Made this today, but got tearing on one side. I guess I underproofed by not taking into account the ambient temperature. Still tasted good, but looked a little ugly.
love the whole wheat bread made easy. Great success with this method.  One problem  recently I used some wheat  that has been stored for  50 years.  Would this cause a problem with the bread  success.  The dough suddenly not coming together correctly.  Dough not rising properly  dense flat bread.
John is it 7g of dried yeast?
Great recipe thank you.
Amazing work sir..am impressed..lv ur enthusiasm great sir..
That looks amazing .I make the white sandwhich loaf every 2 days delish.i put a tray of water at bottom of oven it comes out lovely.thanks John yet another good recipe. 👍
I’m going to try this recipe out.. since I don’t like to buy bread
I tend to appreciate food more when I made it myself
I've checked many well regarded wheat flours and most contain 4 grams of protein in a 30 gram serving. 100 divided 30 = 3.334. So multiplying 4 x 3.334 equals 13.34 grams of protein. Would that be close enough?
Hi John Have you tried adding Besan gram flour into the mix, it just has a high protein content and it’s good for you
Sir,thank you for the recipe,can i add molasses/and if i can,how much i should add?
I've tried making bread a few times and it always fails. This recipe seemed so simple and straightforward that I had to try it. This bread came out perfectly baked. The bread had a wonderful texture. It was not overly dense. This is a wonderful recipe and you are a good teacher. Thanks for sharing.
I’ve added som chilli powder to one of my loafs. Should work out ok???
Hi John the last loaf turned out fine without the sugar.👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 Round 3 tonight but I’m doubling up on everything my 84 year old mam wants to try a loaf.
Okay so I'm a beginner baker and this is the very first bread recipe that I have ever tried. It tasted good, but it was quite a fail since the whole loaf got stuck in the pan even when I greased it.  Any suggestions for improving this experience?
I'm eating this now and I love it! It's a very heavy, dense but soft as well and the flavor of wholewheat is so delicious. This has become my go to whole-wheat loaf starting today. Thank you mr Kirkwood!
Mine came out like a brick😕
Thanks John, I make all my own bread from your recipes. This is the first time I have made the wholemeal loaf from your instructions, every time I have made a wholemeal loaf in the past it has turned out like a brick, now I know why...too much kneading. Thanks again.
I’ve missed out the sugar 🤯🤯🤯 will it matter???
Love your recipes .God bless you. Love from South Africa
Recently started making bread with varying results, came across your channel.  Very well done.  I’m on my third attempt at a wholemeal loaf.  What dimensions are your tin?  I’ve just bought a new 2lb tin, but it still seems far shallower than yours.  My bread has risen over the top after only 15 minutes before putting in the oven.  My measurements were bang on. I’m tempted to buy a 3lb tin.  *edit*. I found another 2lb tin which looks far more like yours.  Hopefully next loaf should have more space to rise.  Love the channel 😁
👵🏻👍🏻
Yummy!
I was taught to tap the base of the loaf to check that it is fully baked. That lookes absolutely delicious. I know you don't endorse particular brands but I would love to  know where you get your grain and where you got your flour mill. Milling my own whole grain flour is something I'd love to try. I understand the flavour is great. Thank you for this recipe.
Thanks for your video absoutly fantastisk bread making ideas.
Home made butter homemade flour…..John your a legend 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Looks delicious John. I love the shower cap 😂💫 I agree… nothing better than that bread smell… nomnomnom
Hi John, I love all your recipes. I've tried a few and they've turned out beautifully for me. Haven't tried this but I'd like to know what happens if my wholemeal flour has less than 14g of protein? The ones that are available in the supermarkets state 10.6g of protein per 100g so will the loaf rise as well as yours and turn out as fluffy?
Can this be frozen.  There is only two of us and we struggle to get through a loaf this size....
저도 통밀빵 매일 만들어 먹는데 이 레시피로 만들어 봐야겠어요 멧돌 구입처 궁금합니다^^
Love your voice
Thank you😊
My bread is not rising further once in the oven, perhaps my oven temperature is off?
Thank you for sharing about the rice grains part
Warm the bowl, never been told that. Great tip.
Finally I found a recipe that doesn’t use white flour, trust a northern English man to deliver! I’m a Yorkshire lass living in America and I’m super happy I found your video. Extremely well filmed and informative. I’ll be trying this tomorrow. Thank you so much
Good day Chef John. I tried the recipe and I can't get it to stay risen when I bake it. I follow all the steps, first and second rise are very good but when I do the last rise and remove the tea towel just before putting it in the oven, the dough deflate a bit and do not rise again when baking it. The dough goes about 1cm above the rim of the tin loaf after rising for 45 min, may be it's not enough?  I did not have this problem with your other recipes using white bread. Would you have any suggestion to help. Thank you.
Love this recipe too.  The 70% hydration for brown bread is the key I would imagine.  Also grinding your own flour.  This would ensure the freshest bread out.  Many thanks again John.
Another great recipe John.  Grinding the whole wheat flour is an intriguing touch.  Is that little bench grinder readily available?  Many thanks.
I like it..thanks a lot for sharing  Great!
Thank you
Woooooooow yummmmmmmy
John, what is the brand/model of that mill you're using for grinding wheat?  Thank you for the fantastic recipes!  My ciabatta has improved 100% and I used to think a sourdough ciabatta was just an impossible dream but found out otherwise from you. Your Bahn Mi was outstanding as well.
Love the shower cap, and rising box tip,they are invaluable can’t wait to try your recipe. Thank you
Thank you for your recipe. Tried it and it was so good.👍🏾 🙂💖
Excellent! Congrats from Argentina
Appreciate this recipe...I've made 6 loafs so far during lockdown in Malaysia ❤️ thank you, John 💜
you are the best - showing in all details the processes for novices in bread baking like me, now I realise I have to go buy this spatula, thank you again for your beautiful and instructive videos
Hello John, I have been baking your recipe using packaged flour, until recently. I now have a stone mill and I cannot get the dough to rise the 3rd time - in the pan. Any suggestions?
Wonderfully  narrative  thanks. If it possible  pls give that    ingredients by Cup measure of wheat n water .
Amazing video as always John. For making a sweeter version of this bread do i need to increase the amount of sugar alone?
Good day.  Trying your recipe now.
Mmm!  I ❤️ bread
John! I would have sent a letter, but I don't have your mailing address, so I'll have to write a long comment. I was unable to sleep tonight, so I decided to try making this bread. I was hesitant to try it because every time I have attempted to make whole wheat bread, it comes out like a brick. I usually try to eat it, anyway, to keep from wasting all those ingredients, but most of the time at least half of it winds up being tossed out. Hence, my hesitancy to try this recipe. Well, tonight I did it.  I am amazed. I have NEVER (imagine me yelling that at the top of my lungs) been able to make an edible loaf of whole wheat bread, EVER!  But, this turned out so lovely and delicious, I wound up eating three slices before convincing myself to save some for later.  It is delicious, and I cannot tell you how thrilled I am with it.  I grind my own wheat, too, and that just adds to the incredible flavor. Thank you for a fantastic video recipe and tutorial!
Hi John watching again this video, because I will try tomorrow your recipe. I must ask you how is your hand? Hope you and yours are well
G
Hi john thank you for your wonderfull recepies i love baking! If i have a 1000 gr kasten mold is it ok for this bread?
Thank you so much for this°
Hi John, this is a fantastic loaf of whole grain bread! How do you think this method works without much kneading? Seems like there is only 45 minutes of autolyse, 1-2 minutes of kneading and another 30 minute proof, then final shaping and 20 minute final proof. A lot of recipes I read said whole grain either needs pre-soaking, very long autolyse (2-4 hours) and also at least 20 minutes of kneading. Some recipes also specify that whole grain bread needs longer to prove than white bread. I have also read conflicting recipes that whole grain bread should not be kneaded too much as the grains may cut and inhibit gluten development. Wanted to get your thoughts!
I love your recipe and your voice💖🌷... Thankyou
Can i replace sugar with honey?
I just followed your recipe and all was perfect until I baked it. I think my tin is not the right quality because the bread stuck, and although it all fell apart, I know it would have been great. Can I use the dutch oven method with this loaf until I buy a better quality loaf tin?
Why the cool improvised proofing box, if my house is 75 degrees? (I WANT to do this proofing box technique :) , but I'm wondering.)
I cant believe you are so considerate and thoughtful to reply each of your messages, even thousands!!! Kindest regards to you Mr.John !
👍🙏
Thank you for you awesome recipe!  I have baked my fourth loaf. Remarkable taste each time! This time the top of my loaf split....can you  please tell me where I went wrong....I follow ypur recipe as best as I can.
I tried your recipe today. It was great! Thanks
Hello Mr John, Thank you very much for your lovely video, Would you please kindly let me know which machine you have for grinding wheat kernels?
Okay okay okay John, I am finally going to comment…. I LOVE all the videos I have seen today. I guess you could say I am “ binge watching” . I am a closet chef who loves baking, cooking and the love and warmth of sharing with friends and family. I just discovered your channel today because of a roast potato recipe ideas and found your no-nonsense way of sharing recipes and techniques very refreshing for a YouTube channel. Don’t get me wrong I can be a fickle watcher as the pandemic draws on and on and on…… However, I must admit I find myself fatigued with the YouTube stardom and quite often UN subscribe to many channels because I feel UN refreshed by the content as it become more about people’s live’s dramas than the topic I subscribed to watch. Real life has enough drama these days. So …. enough whining. I have baked bread to the delight of many through the years(@40) and taught some 20 or more how to bake bread  unafraid and some now excel me in the craft. I love your scientific explanation of wheat in this video and will share your channel with my students in the future. By the way I learned some new techniques on your baguette video as far as the risings (4) the non fussy cotton pillowcase and cardboard foil transfer thingie. I hope to watch more and I will now subscribe. I also find your accent reassuring but some of the bluegrass background music a little tedious ( having grown up in the south of the US) Anyway… what I am trying to say is 👍 & thank you🙆🏼‍♀️ Marjorie from Georgia US
Where do you buy your wheat from online?
I like this bread video. Easy to understand
sir what is the brand machine, u use to make wheat flour
Wow how impressive
Very articulate.....very clear 😘😘😘😘 I am almost smashing my phone to get your bread and eat it 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 thank you very much. You are a good teacher.
I will try mine for the first time......thank you very much for this. With a beautiful voice also 😍🤣🤣🤣🤣
In the oven right now! :D
I love your grinder machine, hopefully i can found that here in indonesia
Hi John, it’s Vy again from yesterday. I tried your recipe without sugar and my bread came out so perfect! Thank you so so much 🥰
Absolutly Perfect 👌
Hi John, thank you for the fantastic video. I have a question: can I not use sugar and achieve the same result? Thanks again! - Vy
Very nice 👍🏻 I love your video 😊👍🏻
I like ur recipes .U R a very good and experienced chef.Thank u sir.
Thank you John, I shall try this one.
This whole wheat bread recipe is THE BEST EVER. Thank you so much for teaching us this beautiful recipe. It is so easy and gives such fantastic results! This is the first time that a whole wheat bread recipe has given such a tender inside. Inside it's as soft as a cake and moist. The crust is so beautiful.  I didn't know how much gluten/protein my flour had so I replaced 14% of the flour with vital wheat gluten. The result was fantastic. I couldn't stop myself from eating it. I had been searching for a great whole wheat bread recipe since forever. Finally found it. Can't thank you enough ❤️🎉
This looks delicious. I wonder if you have a recipe for multigrain bread?
I can smell your bread.  Beautiful recipe
Can I make with  half portion ? And also can I use this to make dinner rolls ,if yes , wat temp & timings ? And any other tips ?
Yet to try ,but I am pretty fascinated with the alarm clock ,msy I know which brand it is ? It reminds my board exams 30 years back unused extensively
Wow to my new knowledge. Thank you for all the little tips.
Cool flour grinder.
A very good recipe. Its delicious
This recipe worked out well but my loaf didn’t rise as much.  And seemed like I had to cook longer.  I’m guess a 9x5” pan has more volume or standard whole wheat flour doesn’t have same protein as your home blend?  Taste good, just not as fluffy and soft as I was hoping for.  I’ll keep trying!
Where can we buy the flour making machine.  I tried Amazon India I could not find it
Hello John from 🇨🇦 I fallow all the same steps except I use milk 🥛 instead of water 💧. If you would like some 8 grain mix I would be happy to send you some. It comes from the oldest working mill in Canada 🇨🇦. Thanks again for the video. Cheers EH!🍻P.S Stay safe and healthy during these unpredictable days we all are faced with 👍🥓😎
Very nice👍
This is very therapeutic to watch! Thanks.
super home made bread very nice to watch.
Made this yesterday, didn’t turn out as crusty as yours, but delicious nonetheless! Thank you
You have a nice voice. :) It's like I'm watching a documentary or a movie with a narrator in the background.
Tried this today, came out perfect! I didn’t have your proofing tub, but sitting near the oven ( cooking dinner) and putting an oiled cling film over the top for the pan proof worked just fine. Thanks for sharing this full proof recipe!
This was brilliant. So easy to follow. My first proper attempt at bread making and it's wonderful!!! Thank you so much.
👌👍❤️
I have no idea about how much protein my flour contains because we get it from the farm
Please what yeast did you use and can it be made at home?
Thank you John! I always turn to your videos for answers!
Why does my crust always come out hard?
Hi John Excellent concise video and instructions I followed instructions religiously but the dough did not rise much in the oven, I would say it finished 2/3 the size almost stayed the same level as I put it in the oven Any suggestions?
Thank you very much for this great recipe. Where can I get your grinder to buy please?
Looks yummy 😋 😍
So. Lovely. I  loved
John  A Great looking loaf ! Can You tell Me please the Brand and model of Your milling machine?
Hello John,  I just tried this and in fact, am still in the process as it is baking and I just turned it for the last 15 minutes.  When I started my dough was so wet (live in Ontario Canada, elevation about 160 metres-500 ft), I actually had to add a bit more flour after bringing the initial ingredients together.  I measured carefully so it wasn't that.  The only other "questionable" is perhaps my whole wheat flour is a bit too old?  It also didn't rise as high as yours even though I waited longer.  Is this possible and do you think it could account for my problem?  By the time I got to putting it in the loaf pan it was pretty close to where it should have been (in my opinion)  Otherwise, love your recipes and presentation.  Marc W. p.s. It is now done and came out fine except for the rising.
Great video sir! Glad to have found your channel. I have a question about the steaming process. My oven seems to be a non-airtight one and I do not have a dutch oven. Can you please suggest a solution for retaining heat?
Hi John, what is the make of the machine you used in grinding your whole wheat grains to powder?
It comes out perfect each time, thankyou so much for all your awesome recipes 🙏👍
Enjoyed your video.
I have a question. is it ok to use honey instead of sugar.
Nice
Thanks you, Mr. Kirkwood. I prefer bread made solely with whole wheat flour.  I'll be making your bread recipe today.
You very organized. I like it.
Thank you for teaching this bread recipe Sir! I really enjoyed listening to your soothing voice.
Thank you so much, I like your recipe. Greetings from Indonesia🇮🇩 👍👍
I love how you explain the steps, it is clear and really makes you want to try it.  If I wanted to add seeds, like flax or sunflowers, to this bread, would it change anything to the recipe? When would be the best time to add them?  Thank you so much for sharing your knowledge.
Hello John, can't wait to make this loaf, my first one ever! So I ordered a loaf tin (same one you use) but after the first rinse the edges inside became all rusty. Question: how do you clean your loaf tins?
This is a fantastic recipe but I can not get it fluffy like the video.  Please can you tell me where I’m going wrong as I am following the instructions exactly.
I can't wait to try this whole wheat bread. I absolutely love your sandwich white bread..it's the best homemade bread I have every made.
Hi John, I’ve tried many times now to make your wholemeal loaf recipe However, I just don’t know where I’m going wrong?? I am following your recipe and your instructions to the letter. I have digital scales to make sure my quantities are exact. Also I make sure I buy flour with the suggested level (or above) of protein per 100g. I also use a proving box. I always end up with a very heavy loaf with a very stodgy crumb ! It doubles in size after the first rise and I knock it back as per your instructions. I always know I’ve done something wrong because after the 2nd rise you say that you will notice that the dough feels much smoother and lighter to the touch. Well.....it isn’t. It’s still very sticky and wet. However, I shape it and put it the loaf tin for the last rise, which takes about 20 mins. I put it in the oven as instructed, the let it cool when it comes out. As said previously, it’s always heavy and stodgy. I’m at a loss as to know what to  do now. Any suggestions from you would be gratefully appreciated. I’m not gonna give up! Many thanks, Alan
Hello from Mississippi
John I live in Jamaica when your reciepy calls for bread flour can All Purpos be used instead .Thank You  stay safe
I trawled the tube doggedly until I found your recipe. God bless you for not using part bleached flour❤️❤️❤️❤️ instant subscribe and bell icon👏👏👏👏
I just made this recipe, my first ever attempt at a whole wheat bread. It came out perfectly. For my next bread loaf, I am going to try this with Atta flour that my wife bought at the local Indian grocery store. Thanks again, John!
Great....just great
Delicious!
Just tried this for the second time, this time using 300g white and 300g wholemeal flours. Turned out perfect and very tasty. Thanks for making this video, John. You are a legend!
Beautiful branny bread, crusty from outside and soft from inside. Must be delicious and nutritious too.👌
Would like to know how to make the Irish bread that is often served with soup.  It’s darker, grainier and with yellow flecks through. Baked in a tin but we don’t know what flour to buy or if it’s a yeast bread. Thank you
I was looking out for a recipe to make whole wheat bread,most of them were using all purpose flour mixed with wheat flour,honestly I wasn't happy,I  came across yr video,I should say well done,and thankyou very much in helping me to make my own whole wheat bread.
My breads have a tendency to collapse slightly when cooking in the oven and they come out a bit flat. Any suggestions to prevent this?
I love your video, thanks for sharing!  Is the recipe with instructions written down somewhere, I'd love to try this at home!  Thank you!!!
So my loaves fell. I think I had too much liquid so was unable to gas it out properly  (I'm in Canada so I had adjust the measures and I'm about as good at math as I am at baking!). But - and here's the point of my comment - the bread tastes amazing anyway! It's so bouncing and good. Thank you. I've subscribed!
THAT...was truly sexy! I've been alone too long. My priorities have definitely changed.
Great explanation and demonstration John! 🌹
I don't even cook, let alone bake, but I'm actually looking forward to eating...I mean, baking...this tomorrow. Such an easy to follow video and you seem so earnest. Thank you! By the way, I might make two at once and freeze one. Any freezing tips? Thank you again!
Love this recipe, I put sesame seeds on top of mine absolutely lovely recipe
Please sir where can I get the organic grains ?! Thank you 🙏🏼
Made one today, it's awsome 😊
Your recipe looks fantastic and easy! Would you please give us the measurements of your bread pan? many thanks
Thanks mate the only mistake I made was thinking the wife wouldn't mind me borrowing her shower cap...lol
how are there 373 dislikes? hehehehehehehehehehehehe anyway, there will always be haters.....
Do you have a Honey Wheat Bread Video? Looks amazing! Makes me wish I could still bake.
Very nice
I tried a similar recipe last week, but I must have done something wrong.  I got a good initial rise, but after knocking back, shaping and baking for thirty five minutes, the dough was uncooked on the bottom.  I’ve had decent results with wholewheat baps, but for some reason the loaf just failed to cook all way through?   I thought maybe my oven was too hot?   Any suggestions?
Thanks for a clear and comprehensive instruction ! For a 1 lb loaf, can I use exactly half the measures ?
John, where i live,  I get wheat flour with only about 10 to 11% protein.  Can you please advise me how to go about making bread with this?
Thank you John for passing your recipe no top man
Thanks John, for this amazing recipe. I had tried several times baking bread with so many different recipes, but never got this kind of a result. My children love it, and are asking me to bake again. So grateful for this simple, yet perfect recipe for baking bread. Love your calm and gentle tone,  while explaining the process. Stay blessed!
Oh John something is going wrong , got the sandwich loaf dowe to a tee, thank you , but the wholemeal one is another story, 1st one was a disaster all gooey in the middle, 2nd one after the first two slices it just keeped falling apart as i sliced it, also it felt heavy and didnt sound hollow, do i need to cook it longer? Stay safe John. edit to say got my book and goodies today thank you x
It's good looking at ur techniques, are there any new recipes for 2021 ,ur  such a wonderful  teacher,God bless u and all the best in 2021
I loved the thought. That it was badically NO KNEAD
Just made a perfect loaf following your instructions here. Delicious! Many thanks
Please tell the name of the flour mill  Is is very nice
If you want to split the dough to turn it into 2 x 1lb loaves do you reduce the cooking time?
I made this bread when you first posted and it was very good, I just made it again except I substituted Multigrain flour,  for the wheat, it makes a good Multigrain bread as well. Thx
John, Today I followed your clear instructions very closely but all went well until the very end when I found the loaf stuck in the tin. I had oiled it. I think it will be ok but it still feels heavy.  Have I done something wrong?
Very good veido love it 👍👍👍👍👍
John, tried your Wholewheat Brown Loaf - came out lovely following  your instructions to the letter.  Many thanks.  Yvonne
10 minutes till mine comes out of the oven, and this time i hope it wont look like a mushroom. let it rise just up to the top of the tin, thanks John, stay safe.
Thank you for the fine details of the bread I am going to try making and baking a loaf tomorrow.  I will let you know how it turned out. Cheers
John...much love from London...you are a star
John, we always enjoy watching your well-presented bread videos. This one is no exception. Thanks so much for sharing your knowledge.
Wow - I have just cooked this and am going to have it with home made butter as soon s it's cooled. First time I have ever made a very tasty loaf of bread! Thanks John!!
I am new to your site. Do you have a way to print your recipes? I am looking forward to trying this bread recipe.
REGARDS
This is one delicious whole wheat bread, and I've never seen a better tutorial on the subject.
Always knew shower caps had a much better purpose,  I normally don't make wholewheat flour bread as it's sticky and doesn't rise somehow but will give this recipe a go today.  Thanks John
Which machine is used to make flour at home ?
Amazing work... will try surely
Can't wait to try your recepé
Thank you so much for the recipe John. Could you mention the measurement of the water in ml please? I tried it with tbsp measurements and it became too wet. Almost like cake batter. But I think I found your recipe the easiest of the lot. Kindly help with the measurement conversions. I don't have a weighing scale . Just cups and spoons. Planning on buying a weighing scale  but in the meantime would love to know. Thank you!
Nice, Could you please tell what it the wheat flour machine you are using in this video, and whether it can be bought on Amazon .
A perfect recipe with all accurate measurements, no doubt British chefs do things perfectly with no room for any doubts. Thank you for the most perfect video.
So nice bread I like it.
Thank you much
Your voice very calmly and soft reminds me of a friend of mine who lives in England 🇬🇧  He is very friendly just like you.  Anyway, also your kitchen is very clean and shiny. When you are working I notice that you are cleaning all the time which is what I like. 🥰👍👍👍
Hi John, I would love to say a big thank you for this beautiful, healthy and yummy bread. I just made it today. It exactly looks like a giant mushroom 🍄  🥰 It's so yummy 😋   Take care and stay safe, from Toronto Canada 🇨🇦 lots of regards.
I'm an ex Royal Navy chef and I enjoyed this trip back to the bakery
Love it John.. so healthy
Hi John. We tried this recipe and it was great. But if I wanted an overnight final proof in the fridge, how much yeast should I use?
You make it seem so simple! I have tried and failed at many whole wheat bread recipes. Will the recipe work if the protein content is around 11-12 gm of protein? Also does the protein content affect the fluffiness of the bread. Every whole wheat bread I have baked has tasted good but the center is a little doughy or it doesn't rise up as much at the final rise. I cannot figure out the reason for it.
Very nice healthy recipe can we skip sugar for diabetics?
Just made this it has a fantastic flavour thank you John
Hi, My wheat flour indicates only 11.5 % protein . Should i reduce the amount of water because of this ?
My yeast was proofed and was good but I dont know why my bread is flat when its in the last rise in the tin.
I`ve made this bread twice now and its simply the best, love your videos so easy to follow too
I would like to try on my microwave.
My prover is a polystyrene box with a reptile heater
Very similar or sour dough bread making
A bit like sour dough then but whole meal on its own does not make good sour dough..
I swear, I'm just waiting for Piglet, Tigger,  et al to show up!! I 🥰🥰
I have seen people greasing the top of the bread with milk or egg but you have not done that and it came out well thank you so much. I am using OTG should I heat both coils top and bottom or only bottom one?
Hey John. Love your 100 % whole wheat bread. I started making it a few months back, and I find it by far the easiest wwf bread I've ever made. Love the fact that I don't have to use extra flour for kneading, just water, its great! I increase the recipe by 1 1/2 and it makes two good size loaves. I also replace the sugar with blackstrap mollasses for a more rustic flavor.
Yummy Great  and Crusty  Blessings and thank you.
Thank you for sharing this wonderful video. I  really appreciate this May God continue to bless you and your channel.
Thank you very much, Mr John. I Loved your bread.🇧🇷
Wow, it truly is amazing. Thanks.
Hello sir, I'm so grateful to have found your channel. I'm Indian and 17, I'm trying to explore more cuisines whilst still making sure of the health factor, your videos help a lot. I love your baritone voice, it's very soothing, makes me feel safe. Thank you sir 😊♥
What kind of stuff you put in the machine to grind ,sir ?
Nice and easy and most of all very well explain éd Thank you
I know you have a video for kneaded 1/2&1/2 bread, but if I want to try this recipe 1/2&1/2, would I replace exactly half the whole wheat flour with AP flour? And would it be nec. to change the quantity of the other ingredients?
I have watched a good number of videos on making bread. This is the best for me. You are wonderful master. Thank you
It was nothing short of a documentary! Thank You Sir, for sharing your insights :)
First time I managed to make a proper bread.  Thank you....but it was a bit heavy so to make it lighter...what would I do?
hi, I'm a beginner and don't want to spend a lot of money on a posh thermometer. Could I just use one of those ones with a spike ? thanks john.
Thank you John  Nailed it,  warm instant yeast, and a heating pad proofing box, fresh milled hard red wheat berries and we have a light fluffy loaf of bread, AND the Wife likes it, life is good.
Hi John.   This looks like a good loaf. Can the poolish method be used to make this loaf.
What is the exact grain you are using, I used 2 parts Spelt,1 part hard white, did not rise in 6 hours, a heave flat loaf, I am going to go and succeed come hell or high water.
I'll try it out this week 😁
Thank you for this video! You take all the stress out of baking, and your recipes are simple and delicious. Yet another successful first try from this rather inept baker, thanks to your help!
I just loved this bread recipe! Made it two days ago and even if it isn't made with sourdough, it keeps fluffy. Is there anyway to readjust the recipe for 400 grams of whole wheat flour?
I’m sad, it didn’t work for me, didn’t rise and was super hard☹️ I’m not sure where I went wrong😞 Did I overwork my dough? But it wasn’t coming together so it was more dry than in the video. Then again, it’s my first time making bread so I won’t give up!
John I’m just trying this recipe and followed everything including warming my bowl but my dough isn’t rising much after 90mins (wasn’t even moving at 45mins), I wonder if my dough was too dry? Should I have added more water as it wasn’t coming together (I did have to add some warm water though as I felt it was too dry)? I know there was no issue with my yeast as it activated properly... Any idea what I should do? Should I let it rise some more?
Hi i watched your white sandwitch bread video also. both are so yummy!! i want to ask you something. the amount of white flour and whole wheat flour is different still using the same sized pan. Can you tell the science behind it. though whole wheat flour is 170 grams higher than white flour same tin is enough for it
Your voice alone is why I'll be listening to ya.  Your video is brilliant 👏
very nice presentation.  You are a great instructor!
I wonder what will happen if I use a stand mixer and knead it for 7 - 8 minutes.🧐 I’ll definitely experiment on this but i’ll only use 50% of the recipe as wholemeal flour here is pretty costly and I’m kinda broke rn.😬
Simply wonderful. Mine just finished baking and the aroma? Out of this world 😋😀 thanks 🙏🏻 a million and stay blessed in Christ Jesus. Amen 👏🏼
Love it !!!! Thanks
Yeaaa I will make this recipe and thank a lots for lovely video,  GBU
Great Chef!!
John Thank you for sharing your knowledge. I Started making bread by watching artisan bread by steve videos and yours is another variation that I have learn from.
Very nice
This is the first time I watch your videos and I must say, your explanations are so clear and simple. I have been looking for a simple way of making whole wheat bread and I’m so glad I stumbled on your video. I shall make this very soon and let you know how it goes.   Just a question, can I use regular whole wheat flour? Will it work as well?  Thank you so much!
Yummy . God bless.
Pooh is that you? Oh bother!! Pardon me, I just love listening to your voice. Thanks for this recipe, I’ll definitely make this.
could one add apples and cinnamon to this?
Which  company  oven u are using
I just made it and turn out so good! I think is the best bread I ever made it !!!’ Thank you! 😀😃
‘
Lovely  From SRI LANKA 🇱🇰
John, I'm a pretty decent cook. I've tried this recipe twice now and it's fine until I put it in the oven. It just dies. I am nonplussed. It would be great if you have any ideas. I've followed the recipe to the word. I use a digital scale for my ingredients. I test the yeast. Everything. I'm about to give up on it.
John, it's Les again, I tried this method and followed the instructions to the letter, but I don't have the correct loaf tins and used a 7" round tin and it seemed to do the trick but when I sliced the bread it had a big hole in the middle and was still a bit doughy.  What did I do wrong?
I love the way u make the wheat bread bread soo nice and simple
Hi John, I’ve never bought a mill for flour because I’ve seen Americans use them on YouTube and they all say you have to use dough enhancers or the bread will be too heavy and yet yours looked lovely. Am I right in thinking that if you mill your own flour it is always brown? Thank you for your wonderful videos
You are an amazing chef! I just discover your channel and I love it! I love the way you explain things with that perfect and calm voice. I also have a question, can you make the second proofing overnight? And then in the morning, just put it in the mold, and let the dough proof for the last time before putting it in the oven? Thank you Chef John Kirkwood!
Hi John, I'm keen to try your recipe this weekend. What is the dimension of the loaf tin?
Your voice is so soothing
Hi, greeting from Indonesia. Nice video and easy step-by-step of making bread for such a beginner like me. My question is how many percent of water should use in certain amount of wholewheat flour? How about white flour?
I just made this bread today and it came amazing! It is so simple and your explanation is soooooo clear and makes it look so easy. Thank you from a fellow bred lover!! :)
Oops, teach me to check before I buy, SR wholewheat flour, oh well guess it’s scones, not bread!!
John, l made this bread. It's so filling and yum... just with a dash of butter! Maybe mine didn't look as good as yours but I will get there :)
lovely. what brand flour mill u use n what's the cost?
Fantastic!God Bless You!!
Great job 😋
Nice
Thanks, I'm going to try this recipe today.  Oh, by the way I enjoy your commentary, you have a very pleasant way about your voice an manner. Bless you!
Hi John, I tried this recipe and it was a little dry.
Made this tdy , it came out ok .did not rise in oven n smelled n tasted yeasty. Pls tell me how to prevent that . It did not brown much in 30 min . Followed recipe exactly . Bought weighing scale for this 😊 need to perfect this . Pls help
Some time my upper portion become hard how to make it soft inside it become fluffy and nice
I will definitely try your whole wheat bread recipe. You made bread making look so easy!
Thanks John for your expertise, however my bread rose twice but which it had cooked in the oven at required time, I found it to be a bit doughy to taste. I used wholewheat and plain flour combined. What do you think I did wrong?
Can I pls know the quantity of whole wheat flour n water in cups (usa) on net whole wheat floor 600gms is 4n 3/4 cup n if I write flour it is 3cups . Pls help
Your video was very interesting and complete, and your bread looks delicious.  I have been baking my own bread for about twenty years and enjoy it.  However I made a warming box for the rising portion of bread making.  I installed a single lamp light fixture in a large upside down cardboard box and inserted a 40 watt lamp bulb.  When it is time for the dough to start rising I simply place the dough in its dish on the table and cover it with the cardboard box.  I then plug in the light and set the timer for 30 minutes.  I also cut a window in the box and taped a flap over the opening so that I could check on the dough's progress.
Good
Thanks once again for the recipe. If I want to halve the quantity, do I do the same to yeast as well, considering I will be using active dried yeast?
What are your thoughts about using honey in place of the sugar?
I followed your instruction (except sink part) and the bread came out just perfect. Thank you very much for the recipe and well explained method.
Tried the recipe but the loaf was still wet in the middle after it cooled down. Also didn’t rise in the oven very much. I mill my own flour and I don’t like it too fine and the amount of water in the recipe is too much for anything but fine flour. I set the mill on the finest setting now and it worked perfectly. Delicious.
Another great video, thanks again John!
Hi John my name is Richard. Can I check what size plastic container did u use  in the sink, and where did u get it from please? it deals with one of the problems i have been having :)
Thank you Sir. Please I don't understand when "pre-heat the oven ...." is mentioned. When you preheat the oven, do you switch off the oven when baking, having pre heating the oven?
Hey John, your whole wheat bread was such a success, I was wondering if you have a video for some pumpernickel bread?
Very well explained. Lovely to watch. Great..
I was skeptical to make this bread because I had read where others said if you used all whole wheat it would be heavy, hard and dry but were they ever wrong!! This bread is absolutely wonderful, it turn out perfect,  I still amazed I made something so wonderful on the first try. I don’t see buying much store bought bread in my future now. Thx John!
Thanks for lovely  bread recipe
Which brand of flour mill you are using is it ...please give the name I am from india want to buy it
Can you add honey to the recipe in place of sugar or would you use both? And if so, when would you add the honey?
It looks wonderful.  The best I have ever seen done, or have done myself. And by the way...  I am not sure anyone has ever told you that but your voice is amazing. I wonder if you ever volunteered to record books.  Audio-books they are called. Some places, will even pay you.  I can just hear your reading some wonderful mystery or romance books.  It would be amazing.
Hello...My experience with this recipe has these issues:  The dough doesn’t seem to rise enough beyond the rim of the pan.  maybe not enough time?  not sure as it’s summer here an the temp was close to 80F.  Secondly, as it has risen about 1/4+ beyond the rim, then put in the oven preheated to 375F, it collapses to about the rim in the oven.  Should I heat the over further? or what?  thanks
Hi John, I love your channel, thank you.  I would love to do a granary style loaf or roll do you have a recipe you'd recommend?
Good morning John can you please tell me how to Keep home made bread fresh my kitchen is a cold one thanks  Rita 😁
Best bread I’ve ever made!!!! I’m so thankful to have stumbled upon this video. Thankyou so much!
Never get tired watching your videos over and over.  Cannot wait to make this whole wheat sandwich loaf.  Thanks
I loved it; thanks for sharing the recipe and the patient and love you put into it.
Thanks for not being a movie star wanabe and shoving your face in front of the camera throughout the video, like so many YOUTUBERS.Way to go.
My dough rose beautifully for the first two rises, but after putting it in the loaf pan, it never rose above the rim and remained half an inch below it. As a result the bread came out quite dense. I followed the measurements and method very closely. Any suggestions?
👌👌👌👍🌝
Can this be made in a pressure cooker
Can someone tell me what brand is the temperature gun he’s using? Love this video. Thanks
Hi John, I made this bread;, easy process. However the loaf totally stuck to the pan. I did grease my pan. Do you think I could have made the dough to wet when roll into a loaf. Maybe I made my counter too wet. Also the flavor and texture of this broken loaf was amazing!
👍👍👍👌👌👌🌟🌟🌟
It's so gorgeous watching you making the bread. I have personally tried and made bread by religiously following your instructions. And the result, of course, is devinely superb!! Thank you so much for sharing your wonderful experience.🙏👍
Thanks,I finally found a very simple recipe for bread. As every one mentions your voice is so nice and soothing
nice.
Thank you ... from the Philippines originally and Princess Avenue Sunderland 👍🏻🙏😍
If you told us your name was Winnie, I think the majority of us would believe you. I  💘  your voice & recipes. Thank you, John.
Think this is going to fail. Wouldn't come together properly :(
Hi John i've just recently discovered your channel and you've inspired me to try bread making - which i did today. I made your wholemeal bread and while I'm quite happy with it, it is a bit dense. Would that be because i couldn't find 14gm protein flour and had to settle for 11gm protein?? Cheers!!
Thank you John. You explained it clearly, simply and with passion. Easy to follow instruction. I made a loaf and turned out good.
The recipe requires 2tsp or 20 Grams of yeast.  2tsp is actually about 8 grams of yeast and two Table spoons of yeast is about 20 grams of yeast?  What is correct?  What is the correct amount of salt also?
Ah, I love everything about this video. It makes me so calm and I'm really excited to try baking this right now! Your accent is adorable.
Just started making Bread at home and I had a quick question- should I add extra water if the loose flour does not come together with the given amount?
Thank you for sharing your video.
I'm watching David Attenborough cooking video, nice 😀
Good on you, John. A belting demonstration and recipe. Next on my list: cheese and onion pasties.
Thanks for the recipe.  Can I bake this in a round baking pan
Hi John, I can only get wholemeal flour with 10.5% of protein. Is that good enough to use to make wholemeal bread? Thanks.
Thank you so much for this awesome recipe. I just followed your guideline and could taste the most wonderful taste of whole wheat bread in my life.
Thanks for the beautiful explanation. I am new to baking breads, I tried this yesterday, the bread came out moist but a lil on heavier side. I made exactly half the quantity you have mentioned, as i have a smaller tin. After the second proofing of 30 min, the bread did not double in size but i continued with the instructions anyway. After the third and last proofing in the bread tin, again i couldn't see much rise. It was just flat on the top. I let it rest for another hour, still no rise. Can you please let me know what could be the reason? I am in Ireland and its summer here with room temperature around 18-20°C.
This is my Go To Video for Bread Making now. Cheers Mate.
John dare I try this ? 70% hydration  spells trouble for me,      ( melted chewing gum dough ) but yours didn't look like that. What do you think?
Mine did not rise fully during the second proofing or the bake. The final product did not rise above the tin, had large airspaces and seemed too moist.  Can anyone tell me what I did wrong?
Can anyone help me with how many Cups of whole wheat flour to use - how many Cups of Whole Wheat flour is 21 oz of WW flour?  I used 4 and 3/4 Cups WW Flour, but my dough looks a lot bigger than John's.  HELP PLEASE!  Thank you!!!
Haven't a clue what happened here . I greased tin well as usual but bread stuck. I freed it round the sides but only the top half came out and left the rest behind. I managed to remove it and slap the two halves together . It wasn't cooked properly at the bottom, so popped it back in the oven minus the tin and baked some more. It's not suitable for slicing but tastes fine, I can break chunks off  so it's not wasted.
can I halve the ingredients for a smaller loaf?
Wonderful, can we bake in normal oven like we bake cake in convention plus microwave. Ours is Lg microwave.
Great Sir
I tried this recipe; it was easy and tastes Yummie.
Thank you John, since discovering your channel, and following your easy informative and also reminds me of good old fashioned recipes, my bread has never been better and absolutely delicious.. You have a new Member 🥰😘 My mum always used to bake bread twice a week when we were small children and I’ve learned a bit.. I stopped baking bread  for many years until recently, when I came upon your channel and I have been baking bread every week since.. we stopped buying bread from the shops now. Thank you Again so much 😊  🥰💖🥰
Your bread videos are so thorough, and your voice is very calming. I just wanted to ask, instead of vegetable oil can I use olive oil?
your videos are too good, thanks for the recipes which are perfect and you include minute details which help new bakers like me.  i wanted to ask a question,  why we pre heat dutch oven before putting sourdough in it, whereas in this video the dough has been put in non heated pan ?
Thanks John. Lived in England and loved the different breads and goodies.
Is it possible to double/triple/quadruple this recipe without having to adjust the proportions of the ingredients in relation to each other (ie. just using graduated progression)?
I make bread once to twice a week, I enjoyed your video very much.  I am particularly interested in milling my own flour, thank you for showing that on your video.
Good day John. I'm currently in the process of making a whole wheat bread. I followed your recipe with the utmost precision but my dough turned out too watery. Not sure if it's because of our climate. I'm living in the Philippines and it's about 28 degrees in here. Do you think my location has got something to do with my trouble?  Your reply will be much appreciated.
Thanks John it worked a treat would you believe that I use my propercator to raise the bread, it seems to work a treat
If I double the ingredents are the timings in your wholemeal recipe the same as in your video
John, love your videos. Please can you tell me what your flour mill is.
Great recipe John. I've only just found your channel. I used your recipe today and it's by far the best bread I've ever baked. Thank you mate.
U talk like a story teller
R u spreading water or oil on shelf
Hello from India sir.... I just recently found this Chanel while in search of authentic buggette recipe. Way you explain it is amazing n sharing the recipe in detail.  Can't wait to give it a try. Although weather conditions are different from ur region to my region. Excited to see how my bread will turn out.
Thank you so much for this recipe and the clear explanation.  This is definitely getting bookmarked.
Wonderful recipe and technique, thank you Chef.  I successfully created my first whole wheat loaf.  I think I would prefer to call you Professor as I learn much from you.
Just made this loaf John which I’m pleased to say turned out really well. I say that because when mixing wet ingredients to the dry I was interrupted by a neighbour for a few minutes. Anyway, I mixed the dough and I was just about to cover it when I noticed I hadn’t added the oil😱 so Hobson’s choice I added it the dough mixture and squished it until I thought the dough would be okay. 🙄 went through first proofing and it rose just fine so I continued with rest of method and then baked it. To my surprise I had a perfect brown loaf which is delicious. I’m telling about my mistake so others can learn and not worry if they do the same.  Many thanks again for recipe and video. 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿
Can i use melted vegan butter in place of vegetable oil - if I don’t happen to have any oil?
Made this today - came out perfect - even for me 😏
Oh John get yourself a Danish Dough Whisk....makes mixing dough a dream !
Just made this bread. Absolutely fantastic. Had to translate from grams to cups. 4 cups of flour and almost 2 cups of water. It was incredibly easy. Thanks you.
Hi John, love your video, especially since you used 100 % whole wheat. I have a question, could you leave the dough overnight and bake the following day? Thank you for your response!
Hello John....GREAT VIDEO....superb information!!!!.  I did try it!!! Instead of sugar,  i have added  1/4 cup of honey. I also added 2 TBSP of chia, 2 TBSP hemp seeds, 2 TBSP Flaxseeds, 2 TBSP sesame seeds. My dough was fine but the final rise  was  not as yours. Please....help......it looks like my bread deflates at the end...........Please help MAKE "My breaD" rise ...ON TOP.  :O)
Does adding guar gum improve the texture of the bread?
Thank you am going to try this..cheers!
I love your bread very much, thanks for sharing 👍just want to know if you can double the recipe.  Have a lovely day 💚
Hi John, loved the way you have explained the entire process. From using the timer to the hot water technique,  everything is perfect. As you mentioned that the flour should have 14% protein but in my flour, it is only 10% so what should I do in this case?
Ooooh....it looks awesome & l’m sure it taste delicious!
Baked John, baked.  Not cooked.  My father was a baker for 70 years and he only had to tell me once. Love.....your videos.  Lots.
I have recently started watching your bread making videos...and i love it ! You are almost like a scientist at work. Precise and accurate. Will soon try out one of your recipes !! Thanks again
The Best recipe ! Classic ! I Just made mine ....
Hello John! I have used this recipe and I love it! However my bread is a little crumbly. I was wondering why that could be and how I could fix it. I do add some seeds and whole grains. And I also did half all-purpose flour. The only thing I can think of is maybe to add a little more water?
What a wonderful vdo. It is clear and informative. Thanks for sharing John.
Hello ! Trying to make bread as per your above recipe but dough of way to sticky.. How to fix that ? Please advise. Thanks.
Your voice Mr. Kirkwood is like Mr. David Attenborough ! Such detailed explanation about bread making! Thank you !
Sound like Mrs Doubtfire’s accent lol but love your recipe n thank you 🙏
Ok. I'll admit it. Although I first watched one of John's videos on a subject I was interested in, I subscribed because I love listening to his voice. The video content  is always great as well though!
I was wondering if it matters whether you use wholemeal flour or wholemeal bread flour?  Thanks
Hi John, I'd prefer to use olive oil in this recipe, will that be ok?
We make this all the time now and always perfect. Thankyou so much x
His voice sounds like the man who narrates almost all natural geographic documentaries. Very calming. Very detailed with information. Thank you for this recipe. Saved.
Hi John, where did u buy that wheat grinding machine from ??
Tried many whole wheat bread recipes before and they all resulted in house bricks. On the first rise this came right to the top of my mixing bowl and it's not small. When it came to the second rise I struggled to knock it back to get it in the tin. Cut my last rise to 13 minutes as it was still rising fast. Amazed at the result I'd given up on whole wheat till now. A great loaf and easy to do.
Hi John, if I'm using a 450g loaf pan, do u think half of the recipe works? Also, can I substitute  olive oil instead of vegetable oil? TIA
Very nice recipe.Thanks for sharing it
This bread is ahhmazing! My first loaf of whole wheat and it turned out perfect! I added 2Tb of honey & absolutely loved it!! Thank you for such a wonderful tutorial!! Love from Alabama, USA!
The shower cap is such a great idea!!!
Hi, I've tried this recipe. This is my first time making wholemeal bread. I like how simple the process is. However, my bread is a little dense. Is it supposed to be like that? Fyi, my dough has risen double the original size during the process. Why is it still dense? I store my wholemeal flour in the fridge. Could it contribute to the density problem? Should I leave the dough for a longer time to rise?
The best whole wheat bread recipe! The method is effortless . The bread turned out soft springy delicious
Hi John,  You have a disciple for life. I have been trying out other 'breads'  from different channels, and fortunately chanced upon your channel. Now I have consistent and predictable results, following your guidance to the 'thumbs up' end. Thank you very much. Two quick questions. Can this recipe be adapted to produce  hard crust buns? And on a related note, Is it possible to make whole wheat ciabattas using your truly tried and tested white flour recipe for ciabattas. Thank you very much for being there for us.
You are an excellent teacher. Thanks for your excellent methodology.
Hi sometimes the bread is really fluffy but bit dry from inside. Could you pls tell me what could be the reason for that
John, I love your channel. My family has greatly appreciated this bread recipe. Thank you so much for sharing your talents and delicious recipes.
Thank you, sir, for giving us such a simple way to make a bread. Your style of explaining makes it easy to follow the instructions.
👍
Hi John, thank you so much for the lovely recipe and the video. We tried your Bread, came out very nicely. You have nicely explained the method with your years of experience. We tried so many in the net but your is one of the best we must say. By the way we are Sri Lankans. (Please do not worry about the Thumbs Down given by some idiots, sick and jealousy people) Thanks John.
Am in Australia..I have making my bread today can’t wait to see the results ...thanks for sharing John ❤️❤️❤️
Chef John, I am so happy  to have found your channel!!!  You explain beautifully what has to be done, in a simple yet detailed way. In addition, your voice is very soothing,  and it somehow gives me confidence to prepare the recipe. Thank you so much! 🥰 Lots of love from Mexico.
Looks delicious John. A ? if I may. Can this recipe be made in a Dutch Oven. Thanks.
I love your explanations. They are so clear and you are so calm! I have made your french baguettes over and over again with excellent results . I now want to try this loaf. My husband likes his bread with whole oats in it. Could I add some to the dough? If so, how much would you suggest and in what order? Thank you!
Great to watch when you are an amateur chef or just need reminding of the steps!
That’s amazing making your own flour , I’ll try that no knead method John looks yummy 😋
I’ve enjoyed your video and can’t wait to make this bread. Is it possible to get the recipe so I can print it please.
Thank you John, for sharing this recipe. My 1st attempt and It turned out beautifully.  Would I need to alter the flour or any other ingredients  measurement should I wish to add nuts and oats? Pls advice. Thank you in advance.
John, tried your recipe and it is delicious. New bread baker, but I want to try sprouted wheat flour so do you have a recipe or tips on substituting sprouted flour for regular whole wheat flour. Thanks.
Can you use milk with the water to hydrate?
Will make for sure my boyfriend loves wheat bread TY for sharing
Wonderful recipe John. It's always a pleasure to watch your videos. I get excellent results every time I try your recipes and that's because of your knowledge and beautiful way of explaining them👍
Meu amigo. Gostei do seu trabalho. Pode colocar legenda em português? Agradeço. Me tornei um seguidor do seu canal. A paz de Cristo.
Hi John, I wonder if you can tell me why I am NOT having as much success with exactly halving the recipes please. Bryan, Pelaw Gateshead.
Thanks for the video chef. Looking to bake this bread now. If I HV instant yeast, do I still need to soak this in the lukewarm water? Or I can use the yeast straight off the box?
Love to watch you baking .. you look after the bread like your child. ❤️❤️
Hi John , have you tried mixing part whole wheat and part white flour? Would it make the bread lighter ?
I mill my own whole meal flour too at home. I will definitely try your recipe. Is instant yeast the same as instant rapid rise yeast.?  What I found in the past is my bread rises fine the first time, but when I shape it to let it rise in the bread tin, it does not rise much at all and none at the time of baking. I am a bit nervous as you let it rise 3 times before baking it. But I will try your method. At the moment I have active dry yeast at home.
I followed some other recipes online earlier but your way seems the best. The details are just amazing. Loved your voice and presentation.
Hi John, I loved your video.  Can you use this recipe to make a boule and cook it on a stone?  I am going to give it a try!  What temp should I heat the stone to?
Beautiful video John, truly genuine bread making, keep up the good work!
Great video, Thanks!  I can't wait to try it!
Nice voice, its like listening to an old Disney story. 😘
I miss my grandpa 😢💔
Most loving Commentary of a Chef I have ever heard...Thank you so much for explaining the scientific side ..
I just love the way you made the whole wheat bread , I love whole wheat bread  !
Hi John!!! I don't have the thermometer for checking the temperature of the water. Then how to go about it for the bread???? Can you pls also let me know where to get this thermometer from? Many Thanks.
I am going to try this next. only I am going to make it wiht 500grams and 80% hydration. my dough comes out dryer some times then I would like. I want to see if I can achieve the same texture as you
I've finally found my David Attenborough of bread making!! Eureka. I love your voice n energy, John.
This is really making bread from scratch!
I am using an aluminum tin and tried couple of time .. unfortunately breads won’t drop out as urs .. it sticks though I use oil in the tin before pouring in dough. Please help.
Hi John. I’ve cracked your white sandwich loaf recipe, but I just can’t seem to get the wholemeal one right! I’m following the recipe exactly, and I have flour with the right protein amount per 100g. It is just very wet when I first mix it. Too wet to handle and I have to add more flour to dry it out and to be able to handle it. Then,when it’s finished,it’s just too heavy and doughy. Probably because I’ve had to add extra flour? Any suggestions?
Just put my loaf in the oven and it looks just like yours. The smell is amazing and we can't wait to try some for lunch. I'm going to watch your white bread recipe for next time and your butter recipe too. You're wonderful!
That looks an amazing loaf of bread Thanks for sharing your excellent video
Just tried this recipe and its the best bread ive made so far. Im still a beginner but this was so helpful. Thank you so much and greetings from Peru 💙
Amazing instructions, I tried your best of both and sourdough. Worked well. In this wholemeal recipe the dough rose in first 45 and again in second round too;  but it didn't rise much even after 90 mins in proofing box (your kind). I still put it in the oven (fearing over proofing). It didn't  rise or fall, just cooked into a very dense loaf. Where could I have done differently?
i could almost taste a piece of that warm bread with butter,  Looks delicious, great video.  God bless
Mine was too moist and turned out a bit funny, but still very edible and very good I'm told, easy recipe I'm going to keep practicing with.
Dear Mr.Kirkwood,  Thank you for taking the time to prepare such an amazing video.  We are at times of quarantine and inviting you to our living room has been a REAL TREAT.  Your voice is so reassuring and pleasant and your explanations are clear.  We can't wait to try making it.
My dough was hard don’t know what went wrong
As always I love your videos. Good practical  advice. Take care & keep well.
Its really makes me to understand your recipe...God Bless you always
Further to my question below , the flour protein is 14.4g,  is that a factor or is it something else?
Dear John, thank you very much for sharing your recipe and video on how to make delicious whole wheat bread. This was my first time making bread, and I am very pleased with the result. The recipe and video are both very clear, and easy to follow. Thank you again!
The best bread making video on YouTube Sir .Thankyou
Your voice is so calming ! Love the way you explained it
HI, I tried the recipe and the bread turned out to be perfect. Only thing I felt is that the bread tasted too yeasty to me! Any clue on why would that be because I followed the recipe to the T
Thank you John for making this lovely  video. I liked your Oven and Whole Wheat Flour making machine. I would greatly appreciate if you can tell their brand names and can share their links. Thanks!
I made the bread today. It's indeed excellent! Thank you for sharing dear John!
I’ve learnt so much about bread making from you John, thank you. As I am home I’ve been baking bread nearly every other day. Your recipes and videos have been valuable  I will be making the whole meal loaf this morning as I luckily got some flour yesterday. Also I always thought I needed to add vit C powder to a whole meal loaf. This recipe you don’t.
Hi John . I tried ur bread today ,the taste was very good but while making it had got extra wet .had taken exact proportions in oz..is it possible the wheat flour quality could have made a difference ,since some bread absorb more water n some less
Thank you so much for taking the time to make this video :)
thank you for this amazing recipe.  I am a complete novice and this is a tasty soft and light bread
Thank you, video was amazing....
If you pull your temp knob off of your stove and look on the back side of it, there should be a screw so you can adjust the tempreture to be more accurate. Look and see.
Hi  Your bread looks delicious.Had a question .Will the ingredients quantity differ if there is a difference in the flour quality ..
I wonder if I can slice a piece of it right after it comes out? Everyone has been saying it's good to wait a whole hour before slicing homemade bread. I've been looking at that pretty loaf for 30min and it's been absolute torture, I tell you.   edit: I waited until it was cold. It was delicious and I am never buying bread again. Fantastic recipe!!
Very nice recipe, really love it. Very usefull in this difficult times. Hope you are doing fine and healthy. Regards from Mexico
Your bread has come out absolutely perfect. Thank you.
Ooh I wanna try this one! I have some whole milk I need to use up - would that work in this recipe in place of flour or no? Thanks John!! :)
Hi John thank you for this wholemeal bread recipe dear. I made for my family because we can't get the bread at the shops because of lockdown. I followed as you showed in video and it was one awesome bread ...Thanks John from my whole family 🙏🤩💜👌🏽
Hi John. I am new to your channel and loving every minute. As you mentioned the gas bubble at the end, I remembered: Should we burst these bubbles before cooking? I am always afraid to end up with a big hole in my crumb. Thank you!
Looks delicious, I have rapid yeast and also sourdough starter.  What measurement should i use if i were to use rapid yeast?  And the sourdough starter?
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Hi John thank you for putting your recipes out there for us all to try. Wondering if you could help me? I've tried to make your whole wheat no knead loaf and everything goes along absolutely perfectly until it goes into the oven and it then doesn't rise any more than the  1" above the bread tin. the loaf browns nicely with great crust but is a dense type loaf. could it be the flour?? I'm using 100% whole wheat atta flour. thanks in anticipation, Terry from Brisbane, Australia
I just started back to making my own bread So good
Yum
I've only ever made a few loaves in my life but made this today and it turned out brilliantly. Thank you, great recipe
Does anyone know any milling machines that are affordable and available in the USA?
Delicious! My dried yeast sachet  was 2 years out of date, still worked.
John, In this video you have the water at 40 deg C yet in another (50/50 Wholemael/White) you say 35 deg C.  Is there a reason for this difference?
Perfect 🍞👌
John, I love your videos, but I have a small query- is instant dry yeast the same as fresh yeast? If not, how much of instant dry yeast should I use  for this recipe, please? Thanks in advance!
What is the name of the machine called that turns the wholewheat into flour...
Thank you sir love all your recipe.❤️
Hi John That clip was great can I ask you where can I buy a wheat grinding machine ? Thank You Andy
Hello there 👋🏼 I’ve followed your French baguette recipe and they turned out amazing. Now I want to try a whole wheat loaf (only flour available due to current situation) but I don’t have a loaf pan. Can I make this dough into a cob style loaf and do you have any tips on how to do this please?  Many thanks and stay safe greetings from the UAE 🇦🇪.
Thank you  for sharing your knowledge and experience.
Once again, wonderful recipe Mr. Kirkwood. Flavor and texture was spot on. You’re making me look like a pro to my family. Thank you!
Wow...you have the ulekan; made from stone. How did you get that? As far as I know, that stone is only exist in Indonesia.
I love your bread recipes just got to the end of a week making  a starter from rye and wholewheat it  is practically volcanic... I am  binge watching your bread recipes... Stay safe everyone ❤️🌈🙏💕 .
Hello Mr John can I make rolls with this recipe also can I half this recipe
Perfect friend
This is a gr8 video! Its given me a lot of confidence to start baking bread at home. Thank you!
Hello John thank you for the video, could I make this bread with sourdough starter?
Love you pot holders!!! I have both red and white wheat kernels. I used the white wheat and the bread is absolutely the best. It so easy to make. Thank you for the recipes and videos.
Love the video.  Love the voice.  Gonna try the recipe.  Thanks.  Good tips.  Nice graphic, too.
wholewheat was the only type of flour left in the store shelf!
Wow Beautiful way of creation-wheat bread. I have never made bread. So I don't know to bake. From Indian Granny
Your video is a joy to watch, one feels your enthusiasm for making the whole wheat bread and especially milling your own flour. Thank you for the recipe!
Hi John Great recipe. My bread is a little like cake in the middle . Do you have any suggestions? Thank you. Trevor
I can almost taste it.
Thank You, John, for the Amazing Video!
Simply the best 👍
Super soft supreme quality home made whole wheat bread 🍞👍🤩😋
Hi John, I’ve made this loaf a couple of times now. It looks great when it comes out the oven. But the crumb is quite heavy and doughy? It’s edible, but I’m sure it should be a lighter crumb? I follow your recipe closely, but I think it’s the way I’m handling the dough before and between rises?? Have you got any tips for me to ensure I get that lovely crumb that you get?? Thanks, Alan
Like your videos but a question Can I use honey instead of sugar?
Kindly share the brand of your mill.
Can I use the convection mode on my microwave?
Excellent, good experience have you watching your video. Healthy!!!
How do I get the recipe?
Wow! Super yummy . Thank you for sharing with us👍
Bread making with love, your a true treasure my friend. Thank you for all you do! I"m kicking keto to the curb now lol.
Mr: Kirkwood, would post the high protein wheat flour name or where to buy it.  thanks
Thanks for sharing. Your explanation makes it seem easy. Your soothing voice makes it even more enjoyable to watch.
Can i use regular salt?
Amazing
Thank you for sharing. This bread is incredibly easy to make and you have inspired me further to get my own little mill (not sure what it's called!). I omit the oil and it still came out amazing!
I just made it. And it’s just the best ever!  In this era of quarantine, it’s best to have certain vital skills. Thanks John for making this times easier for us all! Keep up the good work!
Hi John, thanks for the easy recipe. I am from India and I tried this recipe couple of times but I did not get the last rise as you get. The yeast is active and tested. What is that I am doing wrong?
Excellent tutorial on making whole wheat bread. I am a novice and taking advantage of this lockdown, keen on doing something useful for family sitting at home. Thanks for sharing.
John could you  insert the weight in  grams where you use spoonfuls please? Grams are such a good idea in such recipes
I really want to try making this bread. Yours look awsome
Thank u for sharing n I will try this 🤗🤗
This is a terrific recipe and very good demonstration.  It worked first time unlike other recipes I have tried.  Thanks John.
Memang handal lah chef ni. Aku akan Cuba satu hari nnt. Tq chef!
Can one use the store bought wheat flour ?
Best bread-making video I ever watched..& I have watched plenty!! 👏🌹
I keep my flour in the freezer as I only bake occasionally.  Will that have an impact? Is there anything In should do differently?
Thxs for video
Ok love it
Wonderful.  Looks delicious!  Can I use spelt flour and if so, do I have to do anything differently?  Thanks :)
yummy
Vow, amazing! Thank you solo much!
Hello John, after making your banana bread recipe (great one), I want to try this loaf, however, my loaf pan is 1lb and here the recipe calls for a 2lb pan, since I live alone it would be too much  for me.   Can the recipe be halved? Do you have any other suggestions? Thanks!
Wowwww
Hey John just baked my first whole wheat bread and the taste is amazing, especially when its warm and fresh :) I just have one question: My dough fell over at the edges. How did you get yours to just grow in height?
I just made this since there’s no bread at the grocery stores! I used way too much water and maybe also too much oil, I didn’t knock out as much gas as I should have, and I don’t have a bread loaf tin, so overall I made a lot of mistakes, but the bread itself tastes great :) thanks so much for sharing your knowledge, your videos are the best!! I think I’ll try again tomorrow!
I'll be love tok try this all bread thank you for show me how too made thank you very much
looks very good, I'll have to try it. Keep up the good work.
Dear John, can I use a glass baking dish of the same dimensions if I do not have a loaf tin?
Also I hope you found your wooden spoon! I am now so used to seeing you with it! :) :)
I am going to try this John. When you use tablespoon measurements, do you use the 15 ml tbsp or 20 ml tbsp. My measuring spoons have both. Thank you once again. I discovered your videos last night and have been watching several since, have liked, subscribed and clicked the bell icon too!.:) :)
Wonderful indeed! :)
John, this is the one that I have been looking for. I had copied other recipes but failed. I noticed that your recipe is so detailed and shows useful tips. Thanks for nice explanation too.
I'm sure your whole wheat bread tastes delicious and smells heavenly. Going to make this soon. Thank you for sharing and the tips too.
Finally got round to making this!   Thanks so much for scaling down the recipe for me to 500g flour & the amount of seeds, it was just right. I used a hot water bottle, filled with hot water, put on the bottom of the oven for rising the dough. I divided the dough into two after the 2nd rise as I have 2 x 1lb loaf tins The bread is fantastic & has so much flavour!  I slice it into 'toast slices' & freeze it. There's just the two of us & I get 7 slices out of each loaf, so that's a week of toast. Fantastic!!!! thanks again John I'm still making your Soft Sandwich Rolls every week by the way
How can I get a thermometer like yours.
I’ve never made bread and have little cooking experience, this is going to be my first try. My question - when you say to use oz of ingredients I assume you mean dry measurements such as 8oz=1 cup.
I just used this to make my first ever loaf of bread from scratch and it turned out perfect! I did top it with seeds before baking but they just keep falling off whenever i cut a slice 😂 other then that this video is absolutely  wonderful and easy enough for a first time bread maker to master 🎉
If I were going to try this with a 50/50 blend of plain flour and wholemeal flour, would I need to make any alterations to the other quantities? I haven't tried to make bread since I was a kid, but I just lucked in to roughly 6kg of each from some friends who are moving overseas. I'd prefer to figure out just one type of bread that I can make consistently well, rather than trying different things with different flours and risk wasting them...
Great to learn from you
John! Loved your video mate, you have such a kind voice it motivates me to want to watch all of your videos haha. Quick question, how long does this bread last? and should I have to refridgerate it?
the liquid  15 oz to dry ingredients 22 oz is very high, almost equal.  My dough was more like cake batter not like the dough in the video.  What did I do wrong?
Can you add an egg and warm milk??
Wow amazing
I love this recipe!!’ Can’t wait to try it. I made Hawaiian bread last night.  Total fail!! Not sure what happened. Anyway I’ll make this my next project that’s what my grandson calls my baking
Don't encourage plastic use. We got to chg our ways. Your shower cap is brilliant.
Very Neat. 🥰👌🏻
The best bread ever it is like watching winnie the pooh!
First time seeing your video. Very well done. Just subscribed. How can I  convert 21 oz of flour to XX# cups of flour? Seems it would depend on the type of flour possibly?
This looks excellent. What a lovely video. Thanks, John.
وده علي اساس ان المطحنه دي عندنا
Just found your Chanel & loving it!!! :)
👌👌👍
imayzing your video is very different I liked very much I will make must  this bread 🍞 👍
What is the temperature of oven for baking please
Hi John, may I know if you are using wholemeal flour or wholewheat flour?
Hi John where do you buy  your wheat from
Okay Pooh! I’m making this one ASAP!🥰
I adore your voice! And I appreciate your recipes, thank you😌❤
👍👍
John, I’m making this tomorrow morning. I’ve been watching wheat bread videos for a couple hours and every adds goofy stuff. Finally someone knows the basics. Thank you very much for this video. I’m a retail baker. I can make white bread, buns etc. But wheat is trickier. 😊😊😊
Healthy Bread Baking  scares me after few Terrible  attempts 😱..do you have  Oats+Semolina  Bread?for Gluten free ones😅✋
Hello John , I have successfully made this loaf many times and I would like to try introducing Spelt & Rye flours into this or into your Whole wheat sandwich rolls  recipe. Can you advise if I can simply replace a percentage of the wholewheat like for like or would the amount of water used need altered? Thanks again for your many recipes.
I want more tutorials please
Such informative video..and lovely cute oven you have...
Love your video. I have been making 100% whole wheat bread in my Kenwood bread making machine. But it always comes out a bit heavy and glucky but awesomely tasty. I do make some innovative additions. In India we easily get whole wheat flour from the local mill. But I never get it as nice as your loaf.
Thank you sir very good
Thank you John! I have tried a few recipes for homemade bread since the new year and had almost resigned myself to dense brick-like wholemeal. This loaf turned out beautifully ☺️☺️ so happy I found your channel... especially as I am trying to save for a deposit for my own house, good home baking will keep me on track!
Nice!
WOW AMAZING..
Thank you dear
It looks yummy I love bread
Requires patience to bake a bread.
Could u please make a video for gluten free bread using Sorgham flour?
I just subscribed to your channel I love the way you are teaching us to bake I am from Yucatan Mexico City and I love to hear your recipes.
Absolutely incredible!! Thank you for sharing all these tips. I will surely give it a try asap!!🥰🙏🏻
Hi John, I was just wondering where you got to bread mill from. Can you let me know please. Thanks, Ken.
Good.
He sounds like Winnie the Pooh. Nice.
Thanks John for sharing your recipe. I tried this, it turned out so well & delicious. I have subsctibed and sharing your channel. Reva frm Malaysia.
I want you to be my teacher 🍞🍪🍩😍
Thanks so much for your recipe John it's fabulous. Managed to get me back in the good books with the in-laws anyway and my husband feels like Mary Berry has moved in 🤣 I will look forward to trying some more of your delicious breads, thank you so much for sharing xx
Ohh you sound like David Attenborough.Lovely receipe.
Hi John, I did wholewheat loaf before with 70% wholewheat flour and 30% bread flour and it didnt rise much (its a new pack of yeast so it shud be functioning)  as I was told that im using too much wholemeal flour, how come yours rise sooooo perfectly with 100% wholemeal flour? Whats the trick please? Thanks.
Baked this Whole Wheat bread today. Very happy with the results. Thank you
Good morning Mister Kirkwood First of all sorry for my english I come from Belgium I tried now your recipe for the bread, it's very beautiful. Many thanks, Vincent
Very nice sir
Very very well done and useful for learner’s thank you sir
I've been making a Paul Hollywood Wholemeal Loaf for quite a while now & fancy making yours this week. I use 500g flour & add 90g sunflower seeds, 15g linseeds & 15g oatmeal as my husband is diabetic & needs more 'roughage'! How would I alter your recipe to use the 500g flour & these seeds please By the way, your soft sandwich rolls are brilliant!
Thank you for the lovely recipes, start to do my own home bread🤩
Can u please tell me what is the substitute for yeast please reply
Sir I'm from india, sir from where i can get that wheat grinding machine
If in here only me who missed the temperature? Anyone can help?
Dear John, you have motivated enough and you are the best teacher that I have ever come across.  How well you have simplified the bread making.  Thank You.
WOW ..Bread must be in Museum.
Dear John, I think I will try to bake again, thanks to you. I usually bake when a builder needs high strength material. But I just might have the courage to eat this time. Many thanks.
Hi John. I followed your whole wheat loaf recipe faithfully, and it turned out wonderfully. Slight variation, I allowed the rising in the middle of the ‘turned off ‘ oven but with a stainless steel large bowl of hot water on the floor of the  oven ,which I’m used to doing with my weekly 4 white loaf bake for the family. Awesome results anyway Cheers , Steve, from Vancouver Island Cda.
You Sir are a genius. U-tube is better with your channel content. Amazing. Cheers.
hello jhon, I want to say thank you for every receipt in your youtube channel. your whole wheat bread is the first whole wheat bread that successfully baked in my kitchen. love the taste also. it is so simple and as you say “need put some love to it”. I also experimented the method using 1/3 wheat bran and 2/3 bread flour. still delicious eventhough it didn’t rise as much as the usual recipe, maybe because the amount of the flour is diminished and bran can cut the gluten , right? but overall this is a great recipe and method
Sourdoe please
Thank you, John. Is there a difference between wholemeal flour and whole wheat flour?
Thank you for your video ; it is very helpful that you give time for the various stages of rising the dough.     You have a wonderful voice; you could have been a broadcaster besides being a cook.
I love your videos and your voice
Hello John, Susan from Canada here. I just made this bread, it tastes great, it rose wonderfully I even did my own in the sink bit, but then it spilled out over the edges in the oven and sank in the middle of the loaf. My yeast is good, I did test it. I think I went wrong with the measurements as I converted it to cups not grams. My gran from Wales made great bread but never had digital anything, it was cups of this, pinch of that, so I’ll keep trying. I’m retired now so I have nothing to lose except the weight I gain eating all the bread with butter.  Ta
I LOVE YOUR VOICE
Sir, can you please tell me, from where have you bought the flour-grinder ? Please tell me its name and model. Thanks.
I’d be interested to know how to store the loaf in order to maintain the crispy crust, thanks.
WONDERFUL
wooow thanks for sharing..new friend here stay connected
I'm about to make this..wish me luck!
John, what do you think of autolyzing as a first step?  All the flour and most of the water (save some to dissolve the yeast in later).  I am trying to cut out added sugar and my lay person's brain thinks it could use some natural enzyme activity to create natural sugars from the flour.  Maybe a twelve hour autolyze in the fridge overnight?  My regular whole wheat is currently a Zojirushi bread machine recipe that has sugar, butter/oil and milk powder.  I am trying to go back to four, water salt and yeast and maybe a bit of oil.
This is brilliant, I was looking for this as I want to make my own flour too.
Thank you for the very informative video. I was curious and looked at my whole wheat flour it is only 4 g . I will be looking for better flour. Or better get that nice machine you have and make my own . Seems so nice and easy and great tasting
So I tried baking 100% whole wheat bread 2days ago and it was a disaster - dense and tasteless!!! it just went in the bin this morning and I swore to stay away from whole wheat no matter how much healthier it may be!!! I just stumbled on your video and something tells me I'll have success with it. I'll give it one more go and if it works I'll be back to say a big 'thank you'
Hi John, Looking forward to make this. Please may you give amount for water in mls or cups. Thanks
That looks so nice John!!  I will try to make it this week but i don't have this kind of loaf tin i have to look for it first
I'd love a flour mill, but they are so expensive :(
Could the oil be ommited?
New sink John?
I've just made it, the recipe is really fantastic and it's really the best whole meal bread that I've made and eaten ever. Thank you so much.🙏🌷😊
Can be prepared using home made yeast? If yes what is the amount?
I think I've heard your brilliant voice and speaking in an English course based on a narration of the Book of Acts of the Apostles. If it wasn't your voice, then it was someone's who speaks as beautifully as you do. Your voice and speaking sound so classical. I love them. Besides, I loved your bread making. Congratulations, sir, from Santa Cruz, Bolivia! You're a real gentleman.
Love your recipes
Dang forgot the sugar. I'll try again after this one. Thanks
I've just followed your recipe step by step, it's now in the oven and looks delicious, can't wait to taste it
I have made a perfect bread Mr John I have tried making bread many many times and it always came out as rock solid not as nice like I have done it now. A big fan of you from Pakistan with great baking passion
Mr. Kirkwood, I just finished making this bread and I have to tell you it is delicious.  It is moist and flavorful and so easy to make.  This recipe a person can make weekly even if you think you don't have time.  Thank you for giving us this recipe and your expertise.
Sir very informative respi and also your flour machine and your method of teaching so good awesome.
Thank you for slicing that bread open.
I finally got around to watching this John, thank you, I'm looking forward to making my granary bread later. 😊
Made this, it seems full-proof. It's lovely with soup and lasted around 5 days. Making it again. Thanks a lot mate.
I like your voice so much , feels like i am in history video class  like it’s simple but unique
You sound like the Attenborough guy who makes animal videos for BBC. Great video!!
Great job 👍👏👍👌
I put it in with 1 inch over the pan but then it sinks a  bit in the middle and ends up flat top when done. Otherwise everything else is the same as you. Any ideas?
Thank you for the recipe.  Your instructions so easy to follow so it came out perfectly at first try.  By far the best wholewheat bread I've ever made.
2nd attempt another malt loaf, doesn’t rise for me , give up
First attempt put tsp measure of oil instead of a tblsp measure , oh dear it came out like a malt loaf, second attempt is ongoing now ha ha , trial and error for a complete novice !
Hello from North Carolina USA. I just discovered that the "healthy" store-bought whole wheat bread that I have been eating for years contains partially hydrogenated oils. It's what brought me here. Thank you for the recipe. I am in the upper 2 percentile of people with cholesterol problems. Meds help, but a TRULY healthy diet is also important. I will be making this for myself from now on.
Hi John I made this loaf tonight  I thought I measured and weighed carefully but the mixture was a little drier than you described it but I went ahead adding just a little extra water, it turned out perfect. I added some seeds to the top it looks great
건강한맛가득 맛있어보여요👍
You do such a fabulous job with fresh flour and a wonderful recipe!!! Yummy!!🥰
John, thank you for the video. I live in the high altitude of Denver Colorado, Can you tell me if when baking a whole wheat loaf should Any of the ingredients or length of times in the recipe be altered because of the altitude. I followed your recipe precisely but the loaf didn’t rise quite as high as yours after baking. Thank you in advance for your advise. Brian
Hi John after watching your whole wheat bread for a couple of time I had the courage to try it  I cut down the recipe to 50% of the amount of flour the bread turned out soft and better then all the other time I made whole wheat flour, but the only problem was it just crumpled would you by any chance know why it did that? Thank you
Wow
I am so glad I've come across your video. I have been having trouble with making whole wheat bread as it comes out dense and sometimes wet in the middle. I will try your recipe tomorrow. Thank you so much!!!
Omg.. Awesome howto! Thanks John. One question, do I need to wash-dry the wheat before make the flour in the machine? Thx
Thanks 🙏 good and easy ❤️❤️❤️🙏🙏🙏
Easy recipe
Thank you I received the cap and scrapers🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷
Hello Joun. I am very happy for your all recipes. Thank you very much. 🌷🌷.Here in Dubai I can't find to lb.loaf pan .any suggestions where I can get them from
Best whole wheat bread I have ever tasted or ever made. Very light in texture and taste. Thank you for the instructions.  Well worth passing on to others. I will be trying your other bread recipes
Simple and easy! Looks good too! 40 years of experience can only be perfect! Thanks!
Hello John, i made this bread following your recipe and method precisely to the letter without the slightest alteration...and the result was: Epic Failure :-(   I followed the same measurements of ingredients same steps and method of making, but the dough rose too quickly and it rose covered with lots and lots of holes in it...i made the stretch and fold (or slap and fold) method after first bulk fermentation. Then i put it away for the second bulk fermentation for 30 mins., the dough then got lots of holes in it. I shaped it into a log and placed it in the pan to the final fermentation. And in less than 30 minuted and dough was above the rim of the pan and totally covered in holes. My oven was ready and hot, so i didn't wait longer and popped it in the oven and baked it for 30 minuted. Now what happened completed the ordeal, the dough literally collapsed from the center of the pan and whatever rise which i had from the last bulk fermentation was totally lost. I cooled the bread which i knew was disastrous, but when TRYING to slice it, it fell apart and crumbled! I don't know where and what was wrong, but  i know from the look of the dough that it didn't develop proper gluten and was over-fermented from much too yeast! It may needed kneading or something?!
amazing.i love ur bread making videos. i am looking forward to make.
Hi John. I followed the instructions and all looked just as in the video but when I checked the loaf after 10 minutes it had sunk to below the level of the tin. I must have done summat wrong
Very nice 👍
Uncle john are these measurements correct ? For 300gms flour - 180gms water and for 400gms flour - 240gms water. Also, do all other measurements remain same .. 2tsp yeast, 1tsp salt etc?
I'm very surprised that the cooking time is only 30 minutes, I'm used to it taking about 1 hour with 200 C.
My bread is cracking from the top. Please please tell me what to do?
This bread is delicious and super easy!
Thanks John for your videos. But don't you think that the crumbs is kind of crumbly and can't hold itself? However, this is going to be on my short list for sure!
From Newcastle here living in the States past 19 years. Wanted to find an easy whole wheat loaf recipe so was extra happy to find yours today :) 👍🏼
I m new to ur channel,i loved ur recipe ,will try 2moro n give feedback.Thank you.
OMG!  I made this after watching your video twice. It was perfect and delicious. Thank you so much for sharing.
I've been using John's recipe for some months now and can recommend it. Thanks for taking the time for sharing John.
Can't thank you enough Mr. Kirkwood, I had gotten so discouraged after foraying back into home baking after many years, just couldn't seem to find the handle.  Since  stumbling onto your video lessons I'm baking with confidence again. I did replace one cup of whole wheat flour with a cup of all purpose, just to make the loaf a bit lighter; it worked very well.  Again my thanks, I recommend you to everybody I know now!
Hi Mr John...thank you for this recipe...can I use All purpose flour to do this receipe? I await your reply  Thank you so much. 🤗
Can this recipe be doubled/tripled? I've done it as is and it's excellent but need to make more than one loaf :)
Also, my 20cm long by 11cm wide by 7.5cm high tin seems small for these measures of Bread that you have used .. please suggest the correct measures for my tin size. Should I make it half?
Which rack do u suggest in the Owen ? Lower or middle ? Please let me know Sir ..
I like your voice as if im watching a bread documentation very soothing. Thanks for sharing
John your method of explanation is very convincing.  I feel I can actually smell the fresh baked bread just by watching your videos.  I would like to know the brand name of your mill and from where I could procure one.  Thanks & keep up the good work.
Brilliant mine is the bowl
Very nice, the way of explanation was really good. Thank you
I just made this now and I loved it and I would just like to thank you for sharing this recipe. Now that I’m going to start university soon, I’m going to stack these up and enjoy it with whatever I eat. Once again I really appreciate it 🙌🏼
Hi, can you tell me where you bought your wheat grinder? I’d love to get one to make brown rice flour. Thanks!
I love your calm voice too, and how you really use wholemeal flour unlike many who say wholemeal but they actually mix with other flours...and also love the bowl cover how cool is that!!!
Is possible I mixe huff braed flour and huff whole wheat flour?
OMG! Best bread I've ever seen!
You really don't deserve the down likes, have these people taken the time in their lives to make and share information on youtube? probably not, why can't people just think 'hey this video is not for me or this method is not for me' and go to another, instead of down liking someone who as taken great time and effort in sharing the information. It really is unjust. Well done John, I follow many of your teaching video's and just veganise the recipes, they always turn out some of the best. So thank you.
Hi Mr Kirkwood, Thanks for the whole Wheat bread Video! I have a question about the wheat you use,  I have Hard white wheat, Hard red spring wheat. Kamut and spelt berries! What wheat do you use? None of my buckets have protein listed.  What would you use of the ones I have? Can I mix some? 50 /50 ,  75/ 25 ?  Is some wheat better?  Thank You for your help!!  Next on my list is butter!  grass fed cream butter is 6.50 to 7.00 a pound.   Phil Osan
I made this recipe yesterday and was called to a work emergency just as the first rise had started, I came back 8 hours later expecting to bin the dough. It still looked a little active so I added a little more flour and some water to feed the yeast and it worked, a fantastic loaf with great flavour, not the lightest bread I've ever made, but delicious. and great toasted for breakfast this morning. Thanks John, I appreciate and enjoy your vids, and am a much better baker for watching them......... And I'm from the north of England too :)
Hi John... can you do this with a sourdough starter?
I've heard of people who can wait for bread to cool before eating it - but I have never met one, nor am I one of them...Which is why I usually cook at least two at a time. Great recipe - I think I'll make this soon!
I love this bread. Thank you very much John for another mouthwatering recipe!
I like the recipes you share and I highly appreciate the tips and explanations you give along the demonstration of your work!! Thank you very much :)
thank you so much
What temperature is best for when leaving it to rise? Thanks for the instructions
Awesome !!! THANK you 🙏 I
I must try this. What is the brand of tbe milling machine?I guess it can grind herbs into powder too.
Very well explained John, so many tips u have given while doing your bread recipe.I love & enjoyed watching this video.God bless you
Looks yummy
I used this recipe but made a tray of foccacia instead. I pressed a lot of berries into it and glazed an eggwash on. I'll let you know how ti turns out. I let it rise again after the eggwash
The first rise has come up lovely but it was impossible to do the second step as it was to wet to work with. Getting into a mess I managed to knock it back and put it back into bowl for second rise. Expect I am going to have to add more flour to work with it after this rise and I will update you how the bread turns out eventually.
I have just started to try this recipe and although I have weighed the water my mixture is to wet to form into a ball for the first rise. Why is this. Only thing I cannot be sure of is the temperature of the water as I do not have a thermometer. Could this have caused the problem ?
Love 💕 it thnx for explaining very well
What brand is that Mill John
I hope i can my oven so i can try this different soft yummy wheat bread ..good job  sir👍
Nice video 👍can you tell me the names of the machine which you used to grind wheat?
Hi John! I tried this recipe and I think I have a problem with my loaf tin. Could you please give me the dimensions of the one you use in this video?  because I found several 900g ones but with different dimensions. Thanks a lot!
John, I followed your methods to the "t".  The sponge after first rest was excellent, looked just like yours, and everything went accordingly.  I let it proof about 20 minutes in the tin, and it rose to about 1" above the rim, at which time it went in the oven.  But there was NO oven spring, it came out exactly like it went in.  My pan is 9-1/4" by 5-1/4" at the top opening, is that maybe a little big?  Very disappointed, and its hard to know what went wrong and what to do to fix it. Thanks.
Bread Wi Now't Taken Out.........roll the Hovis music.  Love it.  I think the lad in that ad was John!
Inspiering! 👏👍🇸🇪
Hallo  John Thankyou 🙏 for the rsp. Meine did Not turn out as fluffy as yours but maybe next time it will be better Be Blessed with Health and Sucess Greetings from Austria 💐
What do you use to grind wheat?
Hello John - I made this recipe for the second time ( second time making bread ever) It turned out much better than my first attempt. What a difference not falling asleep makes. LOL :)  It has a wonderful flavor and is so much softer and lighter than the first one. It is so good, I cant stop eating it. Still not without what I think are mistakes. I think I needed to let it proof longer to get it more fluffy. More fluffy? Is that a word? I think my third attempt will be the one I finally get right. I discovered my oven has a bread proofing setting. Who knew? Some times you learn stuff when you read the book. I'm embarrassed to say I've had this stove 10 years now. Too funny. The next thing I'm excited about is the sourdough starter I got from you arrived today . I will be getting that going very soon and try your sourdough recipe.  So far I have shared your channel with 6 people I know. They are better bakers than I am but I think they will love your recipes and instruction style. Thank you John - I'll be in touch.
Thanks John for this video easy to follow.
Well, I made this bread this morning. My first attempt at bread making ever. It turned out OK. Very dense. I don't think I let it rise long enough in the pan. Plus after putting it in the oven - I fell asleep. I don't think it went past 30 min by much because it did not burn but it may have been in a touch too long. Still - it does taste good and goes well with butter and my favorite jam. I will make this again once this loaf is gone. I hope I do better next time. Thanks John - I'm learning.
Wowww it looks super yummmmmmy n thank u for sharing the wonderful recipe with us👌❤
Love yr breadmaking methode, and that voice of yours are amazing, your a great teacher indeed, can see the love you,ve in your jod, eventhough your retire, and on your pension, keep up the good work my Brother May God richt Bless you.  Where did you bought  your machine for maling fluor, can is a Bon na blender to grind the whole what grains ??????  Answer me back please.
Wow - that looks so good. You make it look easy.   I have been looking into getting a home flour mill and was having trouble deciding which brand to get - well thank you for making that decision easy for me. If that one is good enough for you, then that's the one I'll get. The Wondermill.  Can you make this bread using your sourdough poolish instead of yeast? Are the rising times different? Do you have a video using sourdough? Can I substitute the oil with butter?   As a prepper I want to learn to make sourdough breads. But want to practice the methods without packaged yeasts, or oils as they don't keep long term. Red Feather canned butter is good on the shelf for up to 10 years and I would have that on hand. In the mean time I would buy the ingredients from the store and not use what I have put away.  Which wheat barriers do you prefer? Hard white or hard red wheat? Does it matter? I'm sorry if I ask a lot of questions, but I want to learn these things. And I have found the best teacher in my opinion. (you big guy) Thank you John, it's a pleasure to watch a master at work.
Wow 😮
That was a lovely bread  baking vedio ...wow just loved it
شكرا ..من اين استطيع الحصول على ماكينة الطحن ؟ وما نوع الماركة ؟
Tis is the kind of bread id love to eat with butter thank uou n i wish i could see u making the bread in person.
Can you please provide more details on whole wheat you used and link if possible
This video is a treasure.
Thank you so much sir 🙏 where can we get the grinder?
I think you’re a sweetheart too! Wish I was your next door neighbor.  I’d drop by all the time to visit and learn from you. Your wisdom.  LOVE THE WHEAT GRINDING SEGMENT.  -Pete, (Across the Pond in New York City)
How do you make butter...??
YOUR voice is as soft as ur bread,  gives  flavour,  baking & crisp.✌👍🌷
Lovely. A true man recipe. Thanks.
I baked this yesterday! It came out sooo good!!!!!
A one
Mine doesn’t rise in oven. Any help?
Which milling machine you used?
Thanks for sharing!
Hai Jone,  your video was amazing.  From where can I purchase the grinding machine..
Hi Please share the brand of your milling machine.
Thanks for this wonderful video! I was told there's no way to make a 100% whole wheat bread that doesn't turn into a brick. I can't wait to try your method! Is the loaf tin absolutely necessary, or will it work without a tin (freeform/boule)??
Awesome video. I tried it today and it was a total success. Thank you so much.
I'm making a note:  While copying John's recipes be sure to also copy the oven temperature so there isn't a last second rush to locate it when bread needs to be baked. If I wanted to convert this to a sourdough version should I add 100-200g of starter to about 1/3 the flour and water from the dough, let it rest overnight and then add the rest of the flour and water in the morning along with the rest of the ingredients and proceed from there?
I was looking for ways to reach inside the phone and grab the other half of buttered slice.
John, I was told that I shouldn't use any metal tools while making yeast dough, do you have any idea if that's true? I love your videos :)
Dear John, what really sets you apart from the 'competition' is your  attention to detail, the foolproof recipes and your calm voice. I no longer need to listen to a meditation video after work anymore. Instead I go to your channel and wach your bread making videos. Thanks so much.
Very super sir Thank you
Mine came out dry.  I had to add water.  It’s not as soft was yours.  It’s raising now.  I’m not sure how it’s going to come out.  I used 99% wheat but I ran out and added some rye.
Do you also make starter for sour  dough bread?
Beautiful bread
Great job I never saw the water on counter method..👍
Can you send me the link where you get the wheat grains? Thank you
Can you make this wheat bread with out salt
Thank you for being so generous with your knowledge🙏
John,  Thanks for this wonderful recipe and video tutorial. After many failed attempts at making a good loaf of bread, I was skeptical to try yours. First I tried with half loaf and today I again made a full loaf. The texture and taste is amazing. I don’t have a kitchen scale, so I used cup measures and I needed about 50ml less water. Also, I increased sugar to 1 tbsp to suit our taste. If it matters, I used Ashirvaad brand whole wheat atta (used for making Indian roti/chapati). Thanks a ton!
I like all the recipes you made .I am so happy to find out you . Cogratulations.
I done the Whole Wheat Loaf again John,  This was the 2nd and 3rd loaf try's I done of your lovely Whole Wheat loaf idea? the 2nd was cooking then the 3rd followed it afterwards.. The 1st one as I told you was too dense and hard in the middle ! The 2nd one done the same way as your video in weights etc. It was a little dense at the bottom 10% of the loaf?  The 3rd was done the same But I did let it rise in the proofing plastic container in the hot water filled sink, for another 8 minutes than the two before! It still was not over the top like the mushroom you said to watch for?  I also cooked it for another 9 minutes longer than the other two? It was better. less dense and nice to eat.. But still about 5% of the bottom of the loaf was a little dense?  I may reduce the water in the mix by 10% next time see if that helps? My Oven is a fan based Combi Microwave oven with the normal oven and microwave and grill so the cooked items are rotated on the glass dish so better for even cooking!  I be trying you other great recipes soon.
Amazing recipe.. for the 1st time ever my bread has come up perfect. Thank u so much
I love whole wheat bread..
Would you show us how to make keto bread? I've tried many recipes and they're either with too much egg, or too crumbly and dry. At least send me some tips to make a no knead bread that is very, very soft.
how do you increase protein up from 7grams?
Can u pls tell how to store homemade bread for 3 to 4 days??
Love your video and instructions 👌, watched full video
Need a timer like that hook me up thanks..  lovely bread  method. Great job!
High John.  I followed your instructions and everything looked perfect. The dough rose to the top of the pan but when I put the loaf into the oven it shrank instead of continuing to rise. Any idea what I did wrong?
Never thought I'd be baking bread but here I am, waiting for my 2nd load to come out of the oven, inspired by your video - easy to watch, crystal clear to follow. I only wish you had a second, third and fourth Like button! And the fifth and so on.
Just tried this. Followed the instructions and finished up with a Burnt, Heavy loaf, any suggestions?
I love wheat bread!
Thank you for the video. l love and Yummm👌👍💓')
Thank you, excellent video. The bread looks delicious! Got to try this.
Hi John Good morning Very interesting but can you please let me know if I can substitute the yeast by curd.
JOHN THANK YOU FOR YOUR GREAT VIDEOS. I've MADE OVER A DOZEN LOAVES OF YOUR CIABATTA. USUALLY  A DOUBLE BATCH. OUTSTANDING TASTE & TEXTURE.  I USED 2 TSP OF YEAST IN THE WHOLE WHEAT LOAF BUT THE RISE TOOK LONGER THAN YOURS. 20 GS OF MY DRY YEAST COMES OUT TO 4 OR 5 TSPS. WHICH IS CORRECT?   THANKS AGAIN FOR YOUR HARD WORK WDR
A very healthy but easy recipe. Thank you.
Hello John.. I just tried to make your Whole Wheat Bread, I followed step by step the way to mix  rise the bread and need it the same way seen on this video! However I have had a bad result?  The middle 2/3 of the loaf were very dense and doughy even though the outer 1/3 was just right?  After so much careful work making sure I copied the states you did.  The dough did have a good rise after the last state before the baking part, the dough rose up to just over the edge of the 2 lb loaf tin and also even though I greased the non-stick loaf tin, the loaf still stuck half to the bottom of the tin! I had to use a wooden flat splat-or to dig it out? I will need I guess to use baking paper for it next time?  Do you know what could have gone wrong with the denseness of the loaf?  All weights and measures were exact and I even did the last rise in a big plastic food container like yours in the sink of hand hot water!  Thanks for the great videos Just hope I can find out from you why my loaf failed? : )
I just made mine now and its delicious. I am subscribing to your channel right away.
Thanks for sharing yr video n recipe, I am going to cook it as soon as possible.
Is it a shower cap you have used for covering the bowl
Thank you John
Time + Effort + Love + Knowledge = Awesome food :)
Hello John, if you don't mind me asking but what are the dimensions of your loaf tin? I am trying to find a 2 lb loaf tin but their are so many different sizes online.
That’s a wonderful video! Thank you very much! Is there any recipe of yours using home made yeast?  Thank you   Ramya
Nice sir.. Its my all favorite bread.. 🤗🤗😍😍
10 out of 10 for your wife.
Where can I get a milling machine like yours? Otherwise very good video.
Hope the Trusty Wooden Spoons  appears soon.
A moment of silence and thoughts and prayers for Trusty Wooden Spoon's safe return.
Can I leave out the oil? How will leaving out the oil change things?
I tried it second time today and baked at 190 for 30min.both the time I noticed. The bread is not completely cooked inside. Please suggest what to do in such cases
Good recipe
I'll bet this would make fabulous pita bread and hoagie rolls too. Thanks John and you are so right technique is half the battle. :o)
Wow!! Nicely explained! Before watching full video I hit the liked button, it's that amazing.
Great voice. Better without music Imo
Just made this loaf and it made a delicious sandwich. Even though wheat isn't my favorite, I was pleasantly surprised at soft the bread came out. One tip if you're using a glass mixing bowl: you can microwave the bowl before you start making the dough in order to warm it up. It should only take 30 second to a minute with no wetting/drying required.
Hello from India John, thanks for the wonderful video and the recipe. I followed it and the bread came out really well. Every one in the family loved the taste of bread. Just one question, I have kept the bread loaf in the fridge, since it is quite warm temperature here. After 2-3 days, it is giving that fermentation smell and slight taste as well. What is the shelf life of wheat bread. Pls guide as to what should I do for this. Thanks a ton!!
Can I make this recipe without a loaf pan?
Incredible. This dude is a legend.
I  like the way you live john,simple & easy.This is the way we did it as well growing up.Thanks for all  the useful hints & tils they are a big help to amateurs like myself.P.S just seen you banana & walnut loaf as well.another to try,
Excellent demonstration video, I love the improvised proofing box
good job
omg i love love love this video thanks
Hey John, can I substitute the wholemeal flour with whole red wheat flour? and Should I change the recipe to accommodate?
Its very:clear  Many thanks from Thailand  Lookingforward to more recipe
Can I leave the oil out?
Made this bread with all purpose flour and let it raise for an hr instead came out dam good
What a lovely chanel you've got John! Calm and pleasant voice and foolproof recipies. Thumbs up.
What an excellent video!
Thank you!
OMG, I kept looking for Christopher Robins and Tigger too
Thank you for the video,  Mr. Kirkwood. Can the same dough be used to make pizza by rolling it out on a pizza pan instead of a loaf pan?
John, I followed your instructions to the letter. I made an amazing bread. My family loved it.  This is the best whole wheat bread tutorial I have ever seen. Plus your voice is so calm and easy to listen to. Thank you so much.
Great recipes John! Thank you for sharing. Is there any chance of having some low carb bread/meal recipes also, please?
How do you keep your sink spotless?
Following being diagnosed with hypertension at 29 years old, I sought all ways to improve my diet. Wholemeal bread was listed as one of the best ways to drop blood pressure. I have never baked before today, but after following this recipe to the letter (I did opt for just the flour over the top and tea towel for the final rise) I now have a glorious loaf of bread like something from my local bakery. I’m chuffed! Thank you so much for this fantastic lesson, I know I will continue to bake this into the future and share your video with my family. Thanks from Meath, Ireland.
Made this loaf today with White Wings Wholemeal flour 10.8% protein and it worked wonderfully. Looks exactly like yours and I’m so proud of myself and my family loved it. It’s all gone already. Thanks for this recipe and your video which I watched twice before attempting it.
the inside of my baked loaf is soggy, i thought i followed ur instruction to a tee, i wonder what did i do wrong
I am very interested in your flour mill. Will you disclose the brand of the mill.          thank you for inspiring recipes and video. Easy to go to. Greetings from Robert / Denmark
Hi John i have my loaf in oven after following this recipe woooohoo it is looking fab many thanks:)
I tried making bread but failed before. I like to try your recipe.Pls show your butter recipe.Thank you.
Wow!  John you are amazing 😃 will surely try this. I love your videos. Sharing is caring. Thanks for all you have done.
Just made my first loaf by your easy to follow instructions, good flavour a nice crisp crust on top of a sense of achievement.On to the ciabatta next ,many thanks John
I have been trying to make bread for ages but it always seems to have a  waxy crumpet like texture to it. Tastes fine but texture is off. Any ideas why this would be.
The best video of making whole wheat bread 👌👍
Hi John, I loved how calmly and with full patience and clarity you explained each n every thing to us, Just had a little doubt, can u plz tell the exact texture the dough should have before the first rising as everyone uses different types of whole wheat  flour, so I can add more water if required? Should it be sticky or just soft but not sticky?
wooow...that looks delicious!! Thanks for the whole wheat recipe!! And no knead is even better!... sooo many thanks... ...So glad to see this video.  I’ve missed your fabulous voice!...
I want the grinder machine so bad can you give me some information please wher did you get, I like your recipe thank you.
Jhon u r simply awesome thank you so much for this... It worked out really well
How much is 420 grams/15 oz of water in ml? I checked on Google that 15 oz of water is around 440 grams... so kindly specify quantity of water in ml. Thanks. 🙏
Can i use Jaggery powder as replacement for sugar ?????
Amazing video. I am tempted to try it right away. thanks
I’ve really got this method down now and I’m getting very good results every time....after I bought myself some new tins that is. I’m making really good rye bread too. More bread recipes please!!!
Wonderful
Mmmmm, look delicious almost I can smell it. I Can't wait for tomorrow to make one thank you for sharing Sir.
Decided to give this a try and successfully baked a delicious loaf. Having a large farm style sink though, I had to come up with an alternative proofing box because of the cold climate here. I wound up using my microwave oven with a large glass of hot water inside. It was warm and large enough to accommodate the mixing bowl. Just cover the buttons so you don't accidentally start the microwave 🌝 out of habit.
I made another loaf today but added a handful of porridge oats into the mix and reduced the flour accordingly. Worked well again
John, can you add cinnamon and raisins to this bread? If yes, at what step would be better? How much cinnamon would be good?  Thanks! Btw, I have tried your ciabatta and baguette recipes, they were yummy!
Wow! This bread is excellent. It took a very short time to make it. Made it today it was fun. Very little mess to clean up. Everyone should try this bread.  It’s light soft and very moist. This is an award-winning whole wheat bread recipe. I’m not going to lose this recipe. It raised very quickly. I did exactly what he did.. I let it rise at 30 minutes each time. Perfect bread. Who needs store bought bread after eating this. Easy to make. I used 11/2 teas. Sea salt. Wonderful, wonderful. Thank you chef. I enjoyed the video very much.
Thanks. Usually my breads fail in different ways. You have 5 good tips. My confidence will increase if this succeeds.
Hi Sir your recipes r very good and one thing I want to know where I can buy this grinding mill
Just discovered your channel - excellent tutorials - makes me want to go and try to make bread straight away!  Would this recipe work with spelt flour please?  Thank you!
John, do you think I could use this as a base for whole wheat pizza? If not, could you please post a video on how to make 100% whole wheat pizza?
Thakyou so mach and 👌
Thank you for the video.  I notice you have about a 70% hydration using whole wheat.  Can you vary that level much?.  I recently made a no knead whole wheat bread with about 85-90% hydration.Not sure if a lower level is better.
I like the idea of the 5 minutes out of the pan in the oven. Great tip!
Hi John, I tried twice and my issue is that it does not rise enough on the final 30min... I don’t have a Tupperware like you used, so I just put in the loaf tin into a warm water. Pls advise...
Your voice should be on National Geographic!
Thank you so much.hope to try and succeed
I'm really happy with this recipe except I can't, for the life of me, get it to come out of the pan. I used a glass pan this time and really, really greased it. After 30 mins, it wouldn't budge. I thought maybe it needed to cook a little longer, but after 30 more minutes and carving around the sides, it still won't move. The only oil I have in my he house is coconut oil. Is this my problem? I use it for everything and it is usually a very good non-sticker but maybe with bread it doesn't work. Thanks for any tips!
I have watched your video numerous times, wrote down all the ingredients, and finally made the bread this morning.  You mentioned that the bread is very wet.  My loaf is definitely not.  I'm sure that I could have added at least another 1/4 cup of water.  I am using a generic brand of whole wheat flour (kroger), but have used this bag for another recipe for whole wheat flour bread and it has always turned out good.  Do you have any suggestions?  I would love to have my version look as good as yours in the video.
Thank you so much for this video! Bread came out great and the house smelled amazing! Is it possible to prepare the dough in advance, keep it in the fridge or freezer, and bake it later?
Thanks alot for your delicious recipe and llike your mill where I can buy it please
John, have you ever used Einkorn flour for baking.
Brilliant ! followed your recipe, best bread I ever made. Thanks
Beautiful! Thank you!
💘💘
Superb! A pleasure to watch and listen to. I'll have a go at this recipe tomorrow maybe. Thanks very much
Where did you buy the milling machine?
The Bob Ross of bread
Hi John Made this twice. Rises really well on the two rises. Not sure what’s going wrong but it’s not as soft n fluffy as yours when cooked?
Made this bread today, it should be ready about the time you sit down to supper.  It turned out great, only thing I found was that I had to add a little more water and that might be because I used bagged flour and you used fresh ground, thinking it might have a little more moisture contain.  Made to white bread yesterday, and it also turned out great.  Love listening to you as you sound like a lot of my grandparents, most of them were from Scotland, Wales & Ireland.  They have all pasted and listening to you bring back memories of listening to them when I was younger.
Thank you for the great instruction! Looking forward to trying my first one!
Gave this one a whirl today and everything was moving along well until it came time to bake it. After about 10-15 mins, I checked it again and it had stopped rising and had sunk down. Any idea what I did wrong? During the last rise, it was in my oven to start but I had to move it into my microwave so I could preheat the oven. It kept rising, though, so I thought it was okay. :( The struggle is real but I will persevere!  Edit: I used a scale for the ingredients and also did the yeast test. I'll have to check the level of protein in the flour tomorrow. Also, after 30 mins, it was very stuck in the pan. Do I need to make adjustments for high elevation? I'm at about 4,000 ft/1,220 meters above the sea.
You did three rises:  two in the mixing bowl and one in the loaf pan.  Would it work to have only two rises of the dough?  Would the texture, etc. still be acceptable?
Thank you for the video.  Can I omit the oil in the recipe?  Bread might be a little heavier in texture,  but leaving it out would mean 20 grams  less fat in the bread.
Kindly share the link / details  of the wheat grinding machine...would like to buy one.Thanks in advance
Beautiful 😋
great recipe but more so is your way of speaking, u should be lending your voice to documentaries.
Can I have the crust please.......omg I'm drooling here
Another winner! I’ve tried making bread once or twice before but found it wasn’t worth the work as it didn’t turn out great. I’ve made a few of your breads and they have all been so very good and manageable! I’ve subscribed and hit the bell! I may have binge watched your videos over Christmas break. :) Happy new year to you and yours, my friend.
Love the recipe, but what are the measurements for your baking pan, I know there are a lot of different size 2 lb loaf pans in USA
I've been making bread once or twice a month for about 3 years. Appreciated your  video and your way of teaching us on how your recipe is to be made.  Also, I've never seen this little Flour mill of yours. Can you give us (if possible) some details on it? Brand, model, price, where to get it?
New to your channel. I love it and will start making bread with your recipes. Thank you for sharing your knowledge and recipes. They are pretty amazing.  I wanted to ask:  Could you list the utensils you use?  Are those glass bowls Pyrex or the French ones?  What sizes? I need to buy a couple of mixing bowls and trying to decide on what's best for my small apartment size kitchen.
hi john i was wondering that can i use sourdough instead of yeast in this bread? your videos are the best that i can trust to start making bread thank you for it
I thought you might like to hear about my second attempt at your wonderful no Knead whole wheat loaf. The first one was the best tasting bread I have ever had, even though it didn’t keep its crust. My second attempt tasted even better, with a crust that one can only dream of....Well, what I had of it. Getting it out of the oven it stuck in the tin again and I lost the base of the loaf. No matter, I put the remains back in the oven to crisp up, and as I pulled out the rack, the loaf rolled off into the pan of water below. I tried to dry it out....only the end remained edible but wow! It tasted absolutely wonderful. I’m now on my third attempt! One day....
Can I use olive oil instead?
Nice grinder, would you share the model and brand?
Hello John, Thank you for your great recipe.    I would like to ask you that can I fridge the dough after sit for 30 minutes for a week?
Awesome!   Will try your recipe soon.😊
Such a wonderful video with easy to follow instructions. Thank you! Love the gloves :)
Hi, Mr Kirkwood. Will this bread be good with dried fruits or seeds added in? At which stage do I add these in? Thank you.
Just made this all the way in Tokyo! I’m not a fan of the bread here so always use your recipes and make my own! :)
Made today with superb results. Thank you John.
Can I just say, OMG!!!  Not only was this the easiest loaf of bred I’ve ever made, but it was the best. I can finally make bread from home milled wheat berries and not worry about it coming out like a brick. Thank you so much.   Would there be an adjustment to the amount of wheat if I use Einkorn wheat?  Or if I sprout the berries first?  Again, thank you.
Hi John. I discovered your channel yesterday. I’m a friend across the water, but agree that weight baking is much more reliable than using measuring cups. I am curious. Can I replace the sugar with honey?  I use honey to sweeten everything, including my coffee. I’m excited that this recipe will work for me, as I’ve not had much luck since I’ve started milling my own wheat berries.
Thank you sir for this and I am going to give it a try. Although I do have a question: can I use melted butter instead of oil when incorporating all the ingredients?
Thank you for all your videos🙏🏻🥰🥐 😋👍🏻
Wonderful videos! It's great to watch an expert at work and your voice is perfect.  I can't get much rise out of my dough and it looks pretty craggly, regardless of how much water I use. The protein content is 13.2g per 100g of flour. Is this enough to throw the recipe off?
Evening Mr Kirkwood, I really needed to thank you: thanks to your very precise advice, I've made it! I've watched this video a dozen times, took notes, prepared everything and this morning the miracle happened: a beautiful loaf of whole wheat bread. Of course, it's not perfect but I think I know why (It was a bit cool in my house and maybe the yeast wasn't as lively as it should have been.) and I can improve. The bread looks good and tastes even better, so thank you again, sir.
Mr froggy voice ur phenominal
Hi,  first of all,  as everyone else stated , the  speech delivery is very soothing and clear.  i followed the instructions to the T. But there is always this yeast aroma that comes after its done too.  And the bread didn't become as fluffy as in your video, even though it rose as required. Kindly guide.
You are amazing John. I just finished making this wonderful bread. Everything has been carefully thought through and your recipe is 100% replicable. Thank you for the great videos you have created...
Hello John. If I use a thermometer to check the “doneness” of the bread after it has baked, what should be the thermometer reading?   Thanks.
Thanks a lot. I followed your recipe and baked a delicious loaf.
Very good video.. thank you for the information
I retired 20 years ago John and have always wanted to make some bread. Today, following your Whole Wheat recipe, I did. It turned out actually edible, but maybe a little dry. Probably not kneading it quite enough and maybe a bit short on the liquid. I will attempt it again soon though. I did hit the sub and bell. Thanks again John.
Hi, would like to know if I can subs the oil with other ingredients or just leave it out totally?
I'm going to try this recipe or method.  Thank u 4 the tutorial 😊👍💕🇱🇷
My mouth was watering so bad after watching this, I ate the 3 cups of flour.  Wonderful educational video. Thank you John.
I made this last night. I should've started earlier yesterday so that I could eat some with dinner, because when it came out of the oven, it smelled so good, but I was too full from dinner. So, I had to wait til this morning. My 3 year old had a slice last night though and she said it was yummy. And what did she request this morning when I asked her what she wanted for breakfast? Wheat bread. With Raw Honey and butter. I had some this morning too with my oatmeal. It was hearty and very satisfying. I will be making this bread again soon. I'm also going to try the 50/50 recipe which I'm certain that my husband, Mom and Grandma will love.
Hello Mr Kirkwood, I was going to try my hands at this recipe this morning but, as it turns out, I only have rye flour at home. Could you do a video on rye bread, please? I've watched countless videos about it and even tried a couple but the result is hardly edible and I can't figure out why. Thank you, sir. Have a good day.
You voice is so nice. Your a homely fella. Thanks for the bread recipe.
Unlike yours my whole wheat bread never inflates.... I don't. Use packed wheat but It still doesn't
wow l love your bread
I made this bread today, I also grind my own flour with the same mill, thanks I like the way you make the bread and I like the video also
Beautifully explained. Love your smooth voice!!
thanks John.
Hi John, I tried making this bread with the exact same recipe however, my bread dough turned out to be stiff and seemed like it was lacking of water. Does kitchen humidity affect the dough condition? My bread turned out to be chewy and it didnt have a nice bread texture. Any advice would be really appreciated! Anyway, love your recipes! :)
Would this mix work in a Dutch Oven?
How about I made this bread and it was absolutely delicious :)
I've been trying to bake whole wheat bread for a while now and each time I end up with a new recipe for a deadly weapon. I will definitively try this recipe as it seems easy enough and the result is just what I'm aiming for. Here's what I like about your videos, sir: the explanations are simple, all your step by step recipes have me thinking I could do it (maybe not the first time, but who knows? : )) and your work surfaces are spick and span. No messing around, no dirty dishes or dirty hands and a way with words. I just wish I'd known where you worked to taste your food. Thank you, kind sir, for the amazing job you do.
Super healthy 🍞👍
I would like to make a whole wheat honey oat no knead bread using this recipe.  Any tips on adjustments and measurements?
What is the machine company name
Thanks John great demo
Looks wonderful. I like the extra 5 minutes to crisp up the loaf.  Almost nothing better than fresh bread hot out of the oven with butter or jelly and a cup of coffee. Well done Sir!
Hello John, I just subscribed after watching 3 videos in a row. Your dulcet tones make you easy to listen to. :)  Could I ask which particular grinder/mill you use to mill your grain please? Thank you, Susan
I love your videos and your voice. It is like watching Winnie the Pooh teaching me how to bake. ^_^
Hi John, can you pls publish the precise measurements in grams for a half size loaf, especially for salt, sugar, yeast and oil. Thank you.
Hi John - why Kosha salt?
Awesome John.....
vg
thank you for your helpful and informative recipes, I am particularly interested in your wheat mill, could you please tell me what make it is?? I would like to try and find one.
Wow beautiful
Very good and descriptive directions
Tried again, this time took whole wheat flour and all purpose flour in equal quantities and kept the rest the same. The bread has turned out really well. Will try with just whole wheat flour again and see how it will turn out. Thanks for a great and easy recipe.
Hi John, loved watching your video and have been trying my hand at baking the perfect whole wheat bread for quite some time now. Tried out your recipe immediately after watching it. I live in India and we don't get the kind of whole wheat flour that you showed easily in the market. So I mixed a little oatmeal into the whole wheat flour, 500grms of whole wheat flour and 100grms of oatmeal. Added a little over 2tsps of yeast and a little over 420grms of water to get to your consistency of dough. The bread is just out of the oven, looks OK but doesn't sound hollow like yours. It did rise well during the first 2 proofing and also in the tin but didn't rise much once it was in the oven. It still felt a little wet after 30 mins of baking so I put it in for another 10 mins, this time out of the tin. Still need to taste it. The browning is also not much.
This recipe got me so excited, loved your voice and all the knowledge to share as a professional baker as well. I’m now a new subbi..
Well, I'm turning in now, but I'm inspired to make a loaf of whole bread tomorrow.  Looks fantastic!
I adore your shower caps and the way you prepare your own home made flour!!!
I prefer Wholemeal bread, thank you I will be trying this soon. Looks amazing! Will also be looking into a Mill like yours too. Excellent idea.
wow this is amazing, and very helpful, i also done the same way you explained it very well
We love brown bread. Thank you
John just made this fabulous bread... It's delicious and follow your instructions easy to make. Thank you.
Wow you’re recipe blew me away when you pulled out the temperature gun just like drag racing!
Can i replace the water with milk for yeast
Can't substitute experience! Amazing video! Thank you Sir!
Looks fantastic, and I can't wait to try it. Your explanation is very concise.  Is it possible to freeze the dough?  I'm hoping to make two or three loafs but only back one at a time as needed.
Made this bread today n it was lovely,thank u for the recipe
Recipe n the way of explaining is  awesome...
Very informative
I love breads.
Hey ... do you use a camera man or are you dooing it by your selv ..? I am an old cook to , from Denmark and worked Many years in Greenland
Thank you, John, This is my favorite bread. I can't wait to make it.
I understand.. I use the US measurement cup..
Thank you for taking time to respond!! I tried this recipe as is with the salt and I guess I used a smaller loaf tin to bake and the bread turned out dry and a bit doughy to taste.. it must have been my fault.. however would like to confirm the following; 1) I used a 8.5*4.5 inch loaf tin.. What size should I be using to get the recipe right? 2) For the final rise I let my dough sit in a warm place and in 20 mins the dough rose about an inch from the pan. And then I let it bake for 30-35 mins. It did not rise much while baking.. Should I have left it for some more time on the final rise? 3) Should the bread be taken out loaf tin to cool once out of the oven? Or should I let it cool in the loaf tin itself?  I ask this because I tried to take it out of the greased loaf tin and it was stuck bad broke in half..😐 I did not flour the loaf tin but only greased it before I put the dough into it.. What am I doing wrong..  Although I could smell a very nice flavor of the bread while it was baking, it had a crunchy crust, it looked nice and aerated when made into slices, my bread tasted a lil undercooked/bland/ doughy..not sure of the right word to use..😔 I would be more than glad to try the recipe again to get it right but would like to rectify any mistakes I may have done.. Appreciate any help!!
Can’t wait to try it. Thanks
can I make a half recipe and divide all ingredients by half?
Liam Neeson making bread :)
Thanks John for this recipe, if I were to add raisins to the dough at what point should I do it?
This is by far the best whole wheat bread recipe that I've come across 👍 I'm going to try this today however wanted to know if it's ok to omit salt in this recipe?
Thanks John.So many essential tips like the warming of the bowl n the wetting of the hands.Slowly but surely I'm gaining confidence.God bless you
Please share the name of the grain mill for milking wheat.
Lovely flour mill.. Where did you purchase it from? Any link to buy online would be of great help... Thank you
Thanks for the video sir. Can you let me know the quantity of yeast used in grams?
Hi, John!  Thank you for your videos - it has been years since i baked bread butI plan to start again as soon as I finish moving and getting settled.  I do want to ask you for a favor though.  I am having trouble finding a 2 lb. / 900g loaf pan in the US...when you have the time to spare could you measure the dimensions of your loaf pan so that I have a better idea of what to look for?  Thanks, Bryan
Glad I found this, I like the very detailed explanation
You are my bread professor and I'm very happy to watch this video! Very informative and everything is homemade, thumbs up!
Hi John, great video and huge fan of your work! Last few times I tried to make this bread recipie the top of the loaf would separate and crumble as I try to cut a slice. What am I doing wrong? 🤯
John, I have made this bread 3 times now without any degree of success.  It tastes VERY good, but the texture that I get (compared to your video) is drastically different.  I've gone over this several times (I am determined) and I think I've determined that 15 ounces of water is way too much.  What do you think?  My texture is VERY wet.  What do you think about the water issue >
John, you reminded me of my dad who manufactured some hammer mills and used to grind the wheat at home and my mom use to bake it for all of us 14 children. You explain very well everything! Thank you!
Do you think it would work to add some molasses to this recipe?
Hello John, i liked your flour mill, from where can  i buy that ? Can you please guide me,
Thank you. I am so happy to find your channel. Sub and thumps up^^!!!
Hi John, I made the Wholemeal Loaf and it turned out beautifully. However, whole wheat bread is a bit too dense and heavy for my taste. I was wondering if I might substitute a 70/30 mixture of white bread flour & whole wheat. Would the other ingredients need to be adjusted?  Thanks!
hello dear sir from Greece!!  what a noble and lovely way you explain everything!!  thank you sir!!
Can you give a recipe for bread in a bread machine.Your recipes are great John.My daughter has brought this machine for me.I am in India John.
Lovely
Hello John, Great recipe again. Hope you do not mind me putting in a request for a 50/50 or 70/30 white/wholewheat sandwich bread made with a poolish and therefore less yeast. I have searched for a lean recipe and I am confused, I know your recipe would be good. Any tips on creating a pullman pan? Thank you for what you have on your site, it is great.
Beautiful 👍
Fabulous! I’m wondering if one could use flax to reduce or eliminate the oil. Anyone know?
Tea towel for American veiwers is a dishcloth (I think)
That is one nice loaf  I will certainly make Thank you, John
I was brought to tears with the sound of your bite, thanks.
Thank you my friend,  from Pismo Beach California
Hi ...I am about to do this bread today. One question, can I double recipe w/o any problems? I want to give one to a neighbor for a nice favor done :)  so... I don't want to take any chances. Would grape seed oil  work? I don't like using vegetable oils and I've tried olive oil, but that's a no go for a loaf bread. Coconut does not go well either in whole wheat. I'm hoping between your recipe and a correct substitute oil, I can finally pull off a whole wheat bread I can like. Texture especially. I think about sesame oil too, but I am currently out and I have to do a half day, round trip, to get it in the nearest 'larger' town. Maybe I should wait until I can get a different oil than grape seed? Thank you John :)
Can you give measurements NOT in metric?
I love your recipe! Very clear instructions too. Thank you for sharing!
So glad I found your channel.  You really know your stuff, you get straight to the point, your not irritating, and your tone of voice isn't threatening to burst my eardrums lol!  Thank you for sharing your wealth of knowledge.
I came for a recipe but, I'll stay for your calm voice.
I've reproduce your procedure [with half-whole spelt flour] and I've got exactly the same result! Thank you very much for your precise, concise instructions.
Hey John, love your videos! I'm having trouble getting this bread to rise fully over the side of the tin. I've tested my yeast (SAF instant dried) and it's alive. The first time I tried making this bread, I gave it about 50 minutes in a cabinet in my apartment, which is usually about 80F/26C these days, but it had risen only a tiny bit over the edge of the tin, and when I put it in the oven the top of it deflated completely. The next time, I improvised a proving drawer with my sink like you do in the video, but after 45 minutes it still hadn't risen enough, and deflated in the oven. Do you know what the problems could be? My flour does have 14% protein, and the dough does expand quite a bit in the first two rises. Do I need to fold/work it more to develop more gluten, or should I just keep waiting until it rises the right amount?
Gas Mk 5?
Thank you so very much! It came out beautifully. I did ours by hand as well.
Beautiful. I'm on my 3rd rise and I'll come back and tell you how it comes out👍
Ur amazing
Good

Hello, I’ve been following you on YouTube for a while now and love all your videos. I’m doing every step just as you do but I can’t get my dough to rise.  I even got the yeast from my local baker this time and it looks good when I put it in the warm water with the sugar. I just don’t know what I’m doing wrong. Never had this problem in Germany or Tennessee before.
Amazing recipe, i just did my first loaf of bread ,,and looks fantastic, cannot wait to taste it. I was looking for a good, healthy and wise recipe for a long time. Thank you for sharing your knowledge!!!!
Thank you sir for your Video. :)
Thank you so much for the video!  So clear and easy to follow.  As the wholemeal flour I have is only 10g protein, I did 400g wholemeal with 200g bakers white flour and reduced the water down to 390g.  The result was still amazing.  I've been able to find some places which sell whole wheat, but would like to find a grinder, are you able to mention the grinder you use?  I notice you have the name blurred, so am not sure if you can.
Hello sir. I liked your video a lot, it is very well explained, I followed your instructions and I have achieved a bread of excellent quality. Hopefully soon I will have the grain mill like the one you have shown us, that's the best thing, grind the grain you're going to eat yourself, while we have no choice but to go to the store and buy a flour that has at least in its specifications 14% protein. I enjoyed your video very much and I learned a different way of making bread, this time, with much greater dedication and love for doing things well, respecting the times to achieve that exquisite bread that you made.  regards!!!
This bread looks like perfection
When will you be making bread with sourdough starter? Thank you for your wonderful recipe! XXOO GMB :)
So love your videos, thank you🍞
I have sent years trying to make a palatable wholemeal loaf that didn't turn out like a housebrick. Today I followed this recipe and lo! I have a beautiful, delicious, wholemeal loaf. This loaf really is lovely. I can't wait to eat it all so that I can make another!  Do try it.
This recipe is amazing man! Keep up the good work. My problem is that  I don't know how much water to use because I don't have a food scale can you please tell me roughly how many cups of water i need in this recipe? Thanks~!
Would you recommend white wheat or red wheat? I tried to bake a loaf with red wheat yesterday (before watching this video) and it turned out like a brick. Also, would agave nectar be a suitable replacement for the sugar?
i notice you do not make any steam in the oven was wondering why ?
I just made this bread today, and not only was it easy (for a novice) but truly delicious! My husband is placing an order for the Farmhouse Loaf next weekend. Thank you for the wonderful videos!
Hey John! The flour you used was a lil coarse...but I used the thoroughly milled one...the one like all purpose flour...is it okay?
Can you use this method, no knead, for ordinary white bread?
Very long process
You make bread-making look so easy. I'm going to try your recipes. They look delicious.
John, you have such a calm intuitive way of explaining that you would have made a wonderful teacher.  Thanks for these videos.
How many days will this last sir? 😊
John have you ever used or heard of Einkorn flour? Would love to see how you would use it.
I love your skills and recipes so much. Thanks for the very clear construction. Please keep updating. Can you please also update video about artisan bread and sourdough? I cant wait to watch it. Thanks very much, you just light up my baking skills
very nice, you make the flower at home
Hello John,  instructions in your videos are clear and the breads I made have turned out very nicely. My one question is that I had to add 450ml of water in this whole wheat bread to get dough like yours. Is it ok. After I bake will update how it turned out. Thanks for such fantastic bread recipes you are sharing with us.
Not only am I enjoying every moment of Mr. Kirkwood's video, I simply adore his voice! I would very much like him to read for us "Winnie the Pooh" or "The Wind in the Willows." Have you considered moonlighting as a voice over actor, Mr. Kirkwood? You'd be grand!
John can u make burger buns videos or if u have one pls link it for me  Thanks in advance
What kind of shelf does the bread have becos I will bake it once a week when I have some time ?
John ur voice is amazing and calming and very inspiring
I made this lovely loaf with wholemeal spelt flour and it turned out delicious, a great recipe John, keep them coming
Thanks again jhon gb
I have whole wheat starter,  can I use this with this recipe and how much ?  Many thanks
Thank you John, this looks awesome, I’ll try to bake it today ❤️❤️
Hi John. Thank you so much for taking up my request for this wholemeal bread. It looks fantastic. As I work alot of hours this no kneed bread will be perfect for me. Im going to try it out tomorrow. Many thanks again. Love your videos they are very educational.. Please keep them Coming. All the best.
Once again John you make my mouth water fantastic video your the best
I just tried this recipe, in fact it was my first try ever at making bread, and it came out pretty good. The taste and texture is great, the shape....it´s improvable :D . Now I am hooked and I will try some of your other recipes :) Thanks for the great content and the excellent explanations!
This is exactly the recipe I asked you for, thank you so much, John! Have made it today and it's delicious!
I like that little mill. I put it on my wish list.
Mr. Kirkwood, thank you for another wonderful bread recipe and I can't wait to try it. Your banana bread is a huge favorite with my family and friends.  I appreciate your willingness to share your cooking secrets.
Hi John... I did it!  I made this wonderful whole wheat bread this morning.  My daughter and grandson LOVES it.... so do I.  Thank you so much for these videos.  I made the sour dough starter which is my first time.  I made your ciabatta bread, so I have another starter in the frig to make two more loaves.  I am having so much fun!
Is it alright to use white whole wheat flour?
Great video and a great loaf once again. I've never had much success with whole wheat but with these instructions how the dickens can I go wrong, I shall just have to give it a go after seeing this mate. Thanks for sharing John.
Brilliant John... I will be making this over the next few days
Ok, I will do that
I finally got a kitchen scale, now I can start trying to make your recipes. A lady at work puts a little bit of honey in her whole wheat bread recipe she says it cuts down which she calls that little funny taste of using whole week. Just thought I’d let you know.
I want a piece of this bread! Okay, the whole loaf - LOL! I am definitely going to try this. Thanks, John!
John, if I wanted to put sesame seeds on top, what do I 'paint' the top of the loaf with. Butter, oil, egg, milk or nothing at all? Second question is, which is better, fresh yeast or dried. My local supermarket sells fresh which I always use, but I'd be interested to know your view. Thanks in advance.
Excellent and well done John. My wife and daughter are both fans of whole wheat bread, so I guess I'll try to make them a loaf this coming week when I am off from work. Speaking of being off from work, I am going to the coast of North Carolina to do some pier and surf fishing with my son and his family. Hopefully we'll bring a cooler home, full of Spanish Mackerel fillets. Do you have any recipes utilizing fish?
I’m making this right now , just waiting for the 2nd rise , love your baking
Looks (and sounds, as you cut it!) delicious! And of course, so does your butter! Thank you for these clear and inviting recipes Chef K!
It looks amazing
John, thank you for the videos, I can see the great care and effort you put in these. Always relaxing to watch!
Yummy John. Wish we had smellavision Maureen
I'm going to try this tomorrow... thank you!
You shared this video precisely when I was struggling to find a no knead wheat bread recipe that could be baked in loaf form. I subscribed just yesterday, just in time! Thank you so much for sharing your skills and education in an easy to follow format!
Your videos are so fantastic - clear, easy to follow, lots of helpful information, and like so many other people have said, your voice is incredibly soothing!
Hi, John! Great video, as always! Question: I know that different types of flour behave differently in terms of hydration. Would this no-knead recipe work with stone ground dark rye flour?  PS: That's a pretty nifty thermometer you have! It's really cool that it doesn't need to touch what it's measuring the temperature of.
Stunning looking loaf John. 👍 Thumbs up from me too.
I could just a slice of your bread with butter!mm!
Another lovely recipe ! Thank you very much! I shall make this bread tomorrow!
That's better than Hovis for sure!  Oh boy!  I really wish that we had 'taste-o-vision'  I'm shocked! Never seen a wholemeal loaf so easy to make and so light in texture at the end.   I've already done your 'make your own butter' it tastes like heaven, nothing like the store bought stuff.  THANK YOU so much for sharing.  Anne x
So it needs THREE rises rather than the usual two. Hmmmmm.  Even your oven looks IMMACULATE!
Wholewheat flour is always so stodgy.  I am really hoping  yours isn't.  Just starting watching. So nice to hear your gentle soft voice again.  You ought to do voice-overs on TV.  They call them 'voice-actors' and it's good money!
"""Well done John great loaf of bread """
I just KNEW you were a professional cook.  That kitchen is totally SPOTLESS.  You must have a very conscientious helper!
Oh wow, I’d love to make my own flour! So cool
Hi John I was hoping you can tell me where you purchased your Mill and flour kernels thank you.
hello John: fantastic videos!  Where did you get your mill?
THANK YOU VERY MUCH JOHN KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK
Looks fantastic John, wish we had smellyvision, ha’way the lads...👍👍👍👍👍🇬🇧
You know John, you'll probably get 10,000 spoons in the mail now..
So glad to see this new video.  I’ve missed your fabulous voice!
Oh that looks delicious!! Thanks for the whole wheat recipe!! An no knead is even better!
Brilliant as always John. So concise. Going to definitely try this once I'm back on a normal diet. And LOVING your oven gloves. Keep up the good work :)
This looks delicious!!  You misplaced your trusty wooden spoon???  If you lived near me I would have given you one of mine. I’ve got so many of them all shapes and sizes!!
Once again a pleasure to watch John. Very informative and very simple to follow your directions. Thanks for posting.
I’ve been looking for a good recipe for this, thank you! Can’t wait to try it :-)
I do not know why, but I am satisfied by your videos! Thank you!
