Try a small treble hook. They won't slip off. You might have to put a piece of plastic worm over any protruding hook from it, to keep from getting snagged in the pads.
Mf fisherman froggo!
How many of you frog gigers know that that puff of blood that vanish into thin air without a trace in the JFK Assassination was from a frog?  Volume comparison is to frog a human is about a gallon and a half would of splash the window preventing driving can't see.  I was there that day not just one frog but two! other one survived that faithful day but not for long. The frog first resemble a salamander with a flat vertical tail! Then it suck in it's tail and began hopping around suppose to be no survivors that day the assassin so close did not allow for scope clearance 4" shot for johns toad brains and that explains  THE BULLET IN THE CURB! If one of you brave fingers could do the world a flavor donate one of you tasty frogs to a.308 video shot at about 30 yards. Either hang it from a tree limb or other overhead with string blast it and compare! Another method drill out an antelope and put the frog in the hole, maybe with a white cardstock sheet of paper for blood tracer detection.  If you think I'm lying look up JFK's brain X-ray look thru his garbage can find a steel ball right beneath it a average size hasselty black widow spider. Do the video I'll  Paypal you 20 bucks I live in the Northwest and haven't seen a frog in 40 years Fish & Game don't like them they disturb waterfowl!
That is a TON of fun. And good eating.
I have done it like you are too it's a ball
Sharpen your book they have to be like a needle
I have a 12 ft fiberglass telescopic cane pole can stay back from bank don't spook them and don't have to drag it hold it just in front I use a small very sharp hook and a tiny piece of red yarn they jump and hook them self no chance of slack
I eat the whole frog well cut their head off behind what I call the ears the 2 dots on the side of the head gut them and skin them all and cut feet off split in half dry

Fuck you and your gay ass thumbnail
I did this in the early 80's in Temecula Ca. in a pond loaded with frogs......YUM!
Church taught you to kill
The only reasons I don't eat  frog legs are that they eat mosquitos, they give an indication of water quality and not enough meat as compared to what is not eaten.
Your a terrible person. Frogs have life’s to. What if frogs were the dominant species and they fish for you and they ate u. It’s sad
Why would you want to catch frogs?
This reminds me of the time the guy was sitting in a restaurant and he said to the waitress do you have frog legs she said of course he said could you hop in the kitchen and get me a cup of coffee.

Hola
hi
cool video looks fun
jump on them frogs
BigRedFishDad,Let me give you a huge tip,The absolute best lure for this,Is a medium size weedless frog! Bullfrogs are highly territorial and cannibalistic.Your hook-Up ratio will drastically improve, too!Try it and you will see a difference!

Use a wine Corker spray painted blue
