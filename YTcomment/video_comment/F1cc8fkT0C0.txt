You look like you really love riding horses
Could you do this on a chilled whipped cream frosted cake?
the ganache wasn’t sweet bitter taste and the consistency made it so runny even after following all the instructions perfectly

Do I have to do anything different for a semi naked cake?
Is that frosting or fondant she put the drip on ? Can I use both or only fondant ?
I use chocolate spread melted, works so so much better! And  tastes nicer too xx
Amazing
Why do you use heavy cream?
somehow I messed it up.  will try again.
Hey! My name is Lynn I really love you cakes and the deigns and basically everything about them I don’t mind if you don’t answer because your probably really busy. But if you do I was wondering if you could make a cake that has less icing on your tik tok  I mean I love icing and I bet a lot of people do but I was going to follow one of your cake recipes for my friends birthday but she doesn’t like a lot of icing or jam and filling on the inside, she’s a bit picky.😅 if you could that would be amazing. I just turned 12 this month and when I grow up I want to be a professional baker and bake cakes just like you ❤️❤️💕✨
How long did you have the cake in freezer? I really dont know if it takes 10 minutes, 1hour, 1 day... But it is really nice tutorial! ❤👌
can you use this ganache on cream cheese frosting?
Great video. Tfs
Amazing

How long do you leave your cake in the freezer ?
This is Perfect! Thank you So Much!!!
Getting ready to do my first drip cake! Scared to death lol,  I have black Wilton candy melts, can I use that? What would the ratios be?
Lovely video. Please can one use brown sugar, instead of chocolate and if yes will it still be the same ratio with the heavy cream. How long does d mixture last. Thanks
I tried them based on instagram videos alone (and they’re amazing!😍) and I liked this video! Drips are so fun!
you are so cute thank you i will try this
Does it matter what butter cream is on the cake to make the drizzle? I plan on making a chocolate cake with meringue buttercream. Could I do the chocolatedrizzles on that cake?
You make nice cake I wish I can buy one 😍😍
I don't want to be a liberal about anything lol  Great instructions!! Thanx so much.
Videos like this are amazing. You do it step by step which help alotttttt considering I’m a beginner when it comes to baking lol
Hi , if you're using actual chocolate rather than the chips , what would yhr ratio be ? TYIA x
+Chelsweets Does this also work on cakes frosted with stabilized whipped cream? If I chill the frosted cake prior, will that affect the consistency of the whipped cream when it thaws to room temp? Thx
it’s easy but the problem in our country we don’t have. a Heavy cream / What is the alternative
Where did you get your drip bottle from?
Hi, so say I wanted to use white chocolate, how would the recipe be?
DO NOT SMILE LIKE THAT... it's creepy
Just tried your recipe. Thanks again! It worked brilliantly!!
Great tutorial! Very helpful! Thank you 😁
i tried it with ruby chocolate it turned out really well
Wow it looks so yummy 🤤 Plz share its cake recipe also....
I need to make a pale blue ganache  to drip onto a semi naked cake for my daughter's wedding. If I use the white chocolate chips as the base, will it take on a green hue?  Would I be better off to use candy melts?  And yes, I have waited until the last minute--making the cake on 3/28/19 since the wedding is 3/30/19
Can you write the ingredients in the description (thanks
There ya go ♡♡♡
Hi , i would like to know if you frost your cake with buttercream frosting .
Hey Chelsweets. Can you please tell us which kind of chocolate do you use for dripping cake? Couverture chocolate or compound chocolate or just random chocolate for baking? Thank you!! Wait for your helpful response!!💓
What is the ratio for white chocolate with food coloring?
How much ganache does this make?
Thank you, great tips. When I tired this in the past, my cake was room temp and my chocolate was too hot , resulted in melted cake.
do you need to use heavy cream? can you just use milk?
Thank you very much ma
THANK YOU SO MUCH
Btw, a YouTube channel stole your content and put it in there video. Just wanted to make sure you were alert!
Outstanding instruction!! You are the best.
How can I  make black colour drips ... what to use?
Thank you for the tutorial! At what temperature should the cake be? And what is the white covering on the actual cake: is it whipping cream? Thank you for the help! :)
First of all, don't measure WET ingredients with DRY measuring cups it may be OK for this but for other things it would matter.   Second, why not use a WHISK?????
Hi! Can I use heavy whipping cream instead of heavy cream?
Hi Chelsey is the recipe the same for ganache for drips and using to pipe?! 😉
If you use this chocolate drip, does that mean the cake needs to be refrigerated?
What happens if you use milk instead of heavy cream
Whats the ratio for white chocolate please
Perfect!!
I would love to see how u use white chocolate ganache and coloring.. 😁
There are so many comments I hope this hasn't already been asked... You mention in the video that if you are using gel colouring that your ratio will be different.  I will be using gel colour to turn my chocolate black, how would that alter my ratio?  Thanks so much for easy to follow and beautiful tutorials!
Can u share the recipe for both chocolate n vanilla cake?
How much dark chocolate could I use and how much heavy cream would I need
Is there option for vegan or another thing to use if you don’t use milk products
I want to make a black ganache, can I just add black gel food coloring to dark chocolate?
Hi! Can you add gel food coloring to the ganache? I am making a cake for my nephews birthday and were doing silver and black theme!
I know this sounds weird but can I just melt chocolate and put that on the cake just like you did? Instead of adding the heavy cream.
why do you heat the cream when making a chocolate gnache/drip unlike when you used the white chocolate you heated it all together in the microwave?
Thank you so much ma'am really means alot
Can you use double cream?? (Please answer ASAP anybody)
You need an oil based food coloring for white chocolate. Regular Gel will make the texture weird and it doesn’t really work :)
Can you please give us the recipe for this marble cake
Her: As you see the cream is starting to simmer  Me:I CANT SEE IN THE BOWL!!
very helpful! thank you so much!!
Hi just wondering if you can use ganache instead of buttercream to ice the cake?
3
Ik that it is better when your cake is cold to do it but what do I do if I want my cake warm ?
I love your videos. But I'm so disappointed with this ganache. I followed your recipe exactly and it was so runny and transparent, so I added more chocolate, it thickened up a tiny bit but still all my drops ran all the way down my cake and ruined the look I was going for, and it's still a nasty light brown water look. I'm so sad that it ruined my mom's birthday cake. Why is yours so much darker and prettier?
I like your tutorial.  Thanks.
what frosting did you used?
Hi, what other chocolate chips can I use other than Hersheys brand for the drip?
Can I use this with a cream cheese frosted cake?
Wouldn't melt if it's done in a cake covering in whip cream?
Watching you do the drips on the cake is relaxing- not trying to be weird or anything...it's just relaxing that's all :)
What would the ratio be for white chocolate ganache?
Hey! As I was watching this, you mentioned freezing your cake after adding the second layer of BC...does that not make the cake dry and more dense as opposed to refrigerating it?
Can i substitute heavy cream with some else?
Does anyone know if I can use a bar of white melting chocolate if I chop it up into small pieces instead of choc chips?
Thanks! Your great!!!!!🤗
Hi Chelsea! I was wondering, would the ganache work well as writing on the cake?
Can I make black drips over a cake covered with red ganache instead of butter cream?
Worked wonderfully.  Thank you!!!
I followed the equal part recipe for chocolate ganache, but my concern is after applying the ganache to my cake and put it in the fridge, the ganache starts to crack after awhile. Why is that?
Hi chelsweets can you use sweet condensed milk with cocoa powder to make the ganash please reply to me.Thanks💞💕💟💝
What is the ideal temperature of the ganache to create the drips?
How much should I charge for that cake
Is it possible to do this chocolate drip process onto a marshmallow?  I'm wanting to make a chocolate drip affect on a marshmallow and use that as my cupcake topper for a candy land theme party. Any suggestions would be helpful.
Very helpful!!! Thank you!! Will be doing my first drip cake today for my husband, hopefully itll turn out well...😋
if i need the recipe to be dairy free. what can i use instead of the heavy cream?  and how do you get your cakes to be flat on top and not rounded ?
could you use a piping bag if you dont have a plastic squirt bottle?
I really loved this! I love the simplicity of it and yet it looks stunning .. thank you!

What cake recipe did you use on this cake? It looks soooo appetizing!

Can you use Hershey's chocolate bars?

Does the ganache set or does it stay running once on the cake? I have a cake to do this weekend and I've never worked with ganache. I'm worried about the drips when transporting

Such clear instructions! Thank you!
Thank you so much. I think where everyone else seemed to fail is the temperature of the cake and ganache. And just 2 ingredients. Can you make a tutorial with the painted drip of gold or silver? Or the chocolate wafers? Thank you for clearing things up.
