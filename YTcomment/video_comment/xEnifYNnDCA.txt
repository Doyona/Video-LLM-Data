Thanks Gavin!  My Cheddar came out great!  Used local raw Jersey milk, and doubled the recipe.  Can’t wait to taste it for real after the aging!
What did he call me?
I made my cheddar according to your recipe, although I didn't have any lard so I coated it in butter, through every stage it looked just as yours did at those stages, I stored it for 5 months turning it daily, but when I tried it, it was hard almost like Parmesan, would you know what went wrong? Could coating it in butter have caused this?
Man i never realized how complicated the process was for just CHEDDAR. Now i need to know about all the other cheeses too. Great vids man! 🙌
Mr Webber your cheese making vids are the best! Ive made your cheddar many times and your havarti recipes. Im gonna try that blaand next i think.  Any chance of an edam and a muenster cheese making instructional? ❤ Thank you and God bless!🧀
Nooo! Don't use random ingredients! I don't trust your recipe!
Sorry, beginner here, is annato really necessary?
If you want to double the size do you just double the recipe
How many grams is your cheese, mine with 12L is a lot smaller?
Finally taking on cheddar this weekend. Your video makes the cheddaring process look far less intimidating than books tend to!
Gavin, I have two jersey cows and have access to plenty of raw milk. Couple questions for you as I have tried cheddar on many occasions but I have yet to produce anything that actually tastes like cheddar, it always has a strange pungent flavor to it and I do not know why. I want to follow your recipe here to see if that solves it.   When you say full cream, do you mean to not strain any of the cream at the top in raw milk?  I see the recipe here calls for calcium chloride, do you need this if you are using raw milk?  Thank you!
What else we can use instead of Annato color
What is the reason of light/skimmed milk in some of the recipes together with raw or full body milk
I live 30 miles from Cheddar so if I don't get this right I'll go hide somewhere. Lol. I've been in the cheddar caves and seen and smelt the cheese maturing......I can't live this close and not try.....your recipe is the best one I've seen so far so I'm following it to the letter.
Hi Gavin, long time watcher, love your videos. What size mold is used in this video? Thanks!
Hello please for a 20kg strip of cheddar how much weight should you put on the press?
The professional cheese makers in Wisconsin USA use Lactus Lactus and Lactus Cremoras cultures to give the cheese the soft smooth texture. I found the secret. The problem is that so far I have only found them for sale in bulk containers
So does cheese need to be refrigerated?
Omg the first time I made this recipe I was 7 I was amazed making it again 12 years old and so excited for those memories you are the best
Excellent video Gavin. As a complete novice. I read that I should prepare the culture the day before. From what I can see you add it directly to the milk. It looks much easier to just add it in as step 1. Cheers
Wow
Mr. Gavin you are the best
Gavin, you were right about raw milk. My last batch of cheddar has parasites. I am only using pasteurized milk now. I spoke to a representative from Colanta Milk company. All the milk being sold in stores is pasteurized but not homogenized. It costs more but it sure beats medical bills let alone the discomfort. I don’t know how the cheese makers in England who use raw milk get away with it?
The Ausi accent helps mate. Good on ya. Ahhh cheddar. Cheers.😊
Hi Gavin, what is your suggestion for a Cheese Cave for a broke suburban renter? I really want to start making these cheeses, especially since cheese is so ridiculously expensive in the supermarkets these days.
Incredible to think how far your channel has come. During the grana padano deal you mention this video almost reaching 1M views. Look at the number now! Anyway, I have a question for you Gavin. I have access to fresh raw milk from a farm, anything else I can get from the store is past. And homogenised. Would you recommend pasteurization prior to making cheddar? If yes, how would you pasteurize the milk? Keep it up!
What happen if I don't use the Mesophilic Culture ?
🇮🇹 here, cheddar is better than parmigiano for me

When i mixed the curds after cutting them. They became super small. What could've caused that?
Love your program , from one teacher of English to another teacher of cheese. QUESTION, I made this cheese and wrapped it in banding with butter. My first cheese. After three weehs I am seeing black spots under banding. It was not as smooth as I would have liked after pressing.  Should I unwrap it, clean it with vinegar and vaccum seal? Should I wax it?
Hi Gavin. I just made this recipe last night. It was my first cheese! It looks great and feels really solid, but you can see lines in it where the curd didn’t fully knit together. My weights were all correct. Any idea why that happened? Thanks!
Hi Gavin - can I please ask what the dimensions are of your cheese press? If you have a link for where it could be purchased I’d be appreciative! Thanks, love your videos
No don't cure it .Just eat it. Looks delicious.
I made this cheese last week and it is now vacuum sealed and in the cheese cave aka the wine fridge and I am making it again today. I just added the rennet and calcium chloride about 8 mins ago and now I'm watching TV while I wait. I love how you can kinda go off and do your own thing while you wait in between cause it's a lot of waiting up until it comes time to start cutting the curd and stirring it and what not and then come cheddaring time again more on and off waiting. Wish me luck. I hope they taste good when I cracknthem open. I'll probably try the first one in a month or two and leave this one for 6 until Christmas and make a couple others cheeses to have for the holidays as well. I'd like to try my hand at a mold ripened cheese like a Bleu or perhaps a camembert. I for sure 100% want to try your triple pepper jack. Oh that reminds me I just ordered the book called home cheese making by Ricki Carroll and it's actually going to be here later today from Amazon. So I will be trying lots os different recipes. My adventures in cheesemaking all started with your channel so I'm so excited to keep continuing it with your recipes and others I find as well. Thanks for all the help and wonderful videos 😀
Its 12:29am I just put my cheese in the press for its final hours press at 50lbs. Omg my feet are sore I've been on them all day. But I enjoyed it. From what I can tell, it came out perfect from the look of it. I'm so happy and excited.
I just started making this right now! Ahhhh so nervous and excited, but very nervous haha. So much milk to go wrong. I thought this was a 5 gallon pot it must be 3 gallon cause I thought there wasn't  gonna be enough room. I almost used a smaller pot too but I felt like there's no way it would work. And I was right. Wish me luck.
Hi Gavin, as newly bitten by the cheese making bug, I love your videos with your simple, clear instruction. I also just wanted to thank you for your kind handwritten note that came with my cheese press spring and measuring spoons; it was lovely touch from an online supplier and greatly appreciated. Frank
So you tighten the springs at the 6 hour mark? So really only one time? I'm going to be making this tomorrow or the next day. I have all my milk and im ready to go. I even have a little wine fridge.
Oh wow thats a lot more milk than i have haha. I thought 1 gallon would suffice. Ill have to to back to the store this week and get a few gallons. I think I'm going to try to make it on wednesday. Either this recipe or im going to do the pepperjack recipe you have. I even purchased a little wine fridge on amaon a few months ago to age the cheese in. Nothing fancy just a little one. Just as long as its something I can control the temp in. I also have a vacuum sealer which I plan on using in place of wax. That should work fine, right?
I love you
Quel est le pH final après égouttage mrc
Asmr- angry Italians - cheese making - musak   Win win win win
oh i see mesophilic culture, calcium chloride, liquid rennet, drops of annato.  let me just run to my pantry and grab this stuff to make cheese🤙🙃
Where are the fabled angry italians
If not using the banding method would you wax or vacuum pack the cheese after 2 days air drying?
What type of milk would you recommend?
I was promised to see Angry Italians telling him to gfys where are they
6 months!!?? Im hungry now
Could've mentioned it takes 3-6 months to make ....wouldn't have watched! 😮
Doesn't  the coconut oil leave a destinct coconut flavour in the cheese?
If I were to take pieces of store bought cheddar and added it to milk could it replace Mezophilic culture?  My cheddar is excellent but store bought cheese has a more processed flavor. My cheddar is what I would call artisan style. Store bought must use a different Mezophilic culture.
You are storing your cheddar at 50 degrees.  Would it be okay to age it at 40 in a refrigerator with yogurt and other foodstuffs?
Can I ask were you purchased your cheese mold and follower
Uncle. You are the best chef in the world. Love from Pakistan.  I have been a fan of your art  since  2020 When lockdown began.  ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
So it's safe to use bare hands
Can I use yogurt or kefir as my mesophilic starter?  If so, how much?
شرح بسيط مميز و رائع ❤
How did the early people make cheddar without any store bought rennet?   Or store bought mesophilic culture?
Although I'm not planning on making any cheese of my own, there's something so fascinating and peaceful about watching the whole process of it being made. Fantastic narration and tutorial as well, you my good man have earned yourself a subscriber :)
Annatto does add anything in consistency. It is a colouring agent like anything else you could find on the market today. You might as well add turmeric!
great teacher you are....thanks a lot
my home!!
As an honorary Italian, this is beautiful
Came for the angry Wurzels, found they’re alright, stayed for the sharp cheddar and cider.    BTW, for the ‘Mericans amongst us…cider is Apple beer/wine, fresh pressed apple juice is…apple juice.
So a little bit of holes is okay? I'm wondering if I left them out to long while cutting.
Where are the angry Italians grrr 😤
Il tuo comportamento è accettato. Adesso mi identifico come un "curd nerd".
😡 Where 😡 are 😡 the 😡 mad 😡 Italians 😡😡😡 i 😡 was 😡 promised 😡 drama 😡
bro everyone simultaneously finding the near post, finding this channel in the comments and clamouring for angry italians
No italians 😠 only good cheese 😍
“Cheddaring process” is such a funny pair of words
Where are the OG Mad Italians?? I've only found chill italians pretending to be angry or people using translator
non sarai mai italiano non importa quanto ci provi. io parlo per tutti coloro alla ricerca di una leggenda semi finta
I was promised angry italians!
I’m going to recreate some of these recipes but intentionally put in worse and worse ingredients to piss off the angry Italians further.
Il mangio formaggio

Buon giorno curd nerds 🗣️🗣️
Can I press and wax my cheese into a rectangular shape for making square slices?
G'DAY curd nerds where are the angry italians
Che imbarazzante per te!!! Ma come osi!!!!!!! Sono deluso da te!!!!!!!!!!!! TI DENUNCIO GIÀ CHE CI SONO 😡🤬 (I didn’t even get to see the video since theres an ad) (and yes this for the memes since I don’t see the angry italians) (also why are all the comments so recent lmfao)
Who is here from the near post?
I found one Italian, new comment 😂
Cos'è questa spazzatura!?! Questo non è un blocco di formaggio, questo è più simile a un blocco di starnuti! Maledetto te e il tuo disgustoso formaggio criminale australiano!
ANGRY ITALIANS???  ASK HIM TO WHATEVER OFF!
That soft organ music you have humming in the background adds a nice touch. While the video was playing and the music going, i could imagine outside  the window, barely outside audible decibels, was an angry italian shouting at you while doing this 🤌🏽🤌🏽  Also 3-6 months holy shit
Where are all the angry Italians I was promised??
i think they lied about the angry Italians
WHY ARE SO MANY PEOPLE COMMETINING IN THE SPAN OF AN HOUR
Just ignore the non curd nerds Gavin we love your content
(Yells in pizza) Grrr mama mia we’a clearly own’a da cheese rights! 😡😡
Too many recent comments and not enough angry Italians🤧
The comments are all so recent💀
MA CHE COS'È QUESTA RICETTA, SMETTILA DI OFFENDERE L'ITALIA MAMMA MIA (non ho visto il video)
Where da angry italians at? Cant find them🤨
I'm not Italian nor am I angry. I merely come from Cheddar and i used to work in the cheese shop. Can confirm, this is the proper stuff. Cheers Gavin!
As an Italian I can confirm I don’t actually exist and am actually a figment of your imagination
I wish Italian's were real😢
I came for angry Italians but the video was better
Personalmente mi piace questo
as an Italian, i’m sorry 😭
Was looking for angry Italians but forgot they don't exist
c'est tellement pathétique. absolument massacré non seulement notre fromage mais aussi notre fierté alors que vous vous donnez en spectacle. "Curd nerd" est absolument tellement ridicule, tu essaies de te mettre dans l'embarras ? Je vous demande de cesser de désinformer les gens sur ces mauvaises pratiques et de respecter notre culture. 😡
This is a certified hood classic.
Italians when they realize they don’t own cheese:
😡  Non giustifico questo comportamento. e cosa intendi per 'curd nerd'?  🥿
We may be very different,but we are all united together here because of that post
Even years after the post went up on twitter (or X I guess), here I am, looking for the Italians.
Gday curd nerds
relaxing
HES REAL?
Hai offeso un intero Paese
Angry italians
angry italian
I don’t care if I’m not Italian. I wanna say mamma mia pizzeria in an angry Italian accent
Italia pizza pizza I angry pizza pizzzzzaaaaaaaa 😡🤌 (🍕pizza angry grrr)
What is the Annatto for?
Where tf are the angry italian comments?
I wish I was Italian so I could be angry at you :(
I got to wait half a year to make cheese?
Thank you
I have a question. I’m using milk only hours from being in the cow. Should I pasteurize it first?
From watching a few videos you apparently are the cheese guru. Thank you. FYI I’m getting lots of valuable information from watching multiple videos. I can choose what I prefer to do versus what others have done before me.
I always seem to have a problem with the rennet. I had the milk at 90 degrees for one hour and the milk was still liquid. I reheated the milk to about 93 degrees and the rennet kicked in. I suspect that my thermometer is not calibrated correctly. I’m in Colombia and things are less perfect here.   This milk that I am using came straight out of the cow. This batch had no flies in it. I hope that it does not affect the taste. Ja Ja Ja
What is the annatto for? Colouring?
I gotta try this
I’m in Colombia. This is my next cheese. I like your style very much.
Can I use raw milk from cow?
Excellent job thanks
Thanks a really clear video. Good voice over too
Hi Gavin! I'm taking up cheese making while in medical school, which is definitely an odd decision but it's been a really lovely way to give unique gifts to friends and family. Did you make your own cheese press by chance? It looks much better than the one I bought online where I have to stack barbells on top! Thanks for your help!
Excellent video thanks.
Just bought a dairy cow, and now need to give this, and nearly everything else, a shot. Thanks for the content Gav.
thank you for great content ❤
I live just up the road from Cheedar George caves where this cheese was originally matured.  Its a tourist attraction now
Super nice
Interesting how the cheese has to dry at room temperature for so long.
Silently wondering how the original cheese pioneers... piece together such complex ingredients to make it through the process.
Had no idea how long it took to make cheese
Hello 👋 ! Do you have your own cheese shop ? And not the Monty-python type which had NO cheese, not even cheddar 😂
Love all the videos. Been wanting to get into cheese making a while but I think now is the time. Shipping from Australia is viscous though. Any suggestions on a similar kit in Europe?
Hey gavin watching the cheddar cheese y9u don't say whether  you have to keep the temp at 33 degrees or do y9u turn the heatof all togerther
Would you make any changes to this recipe or process if you were going to vac seal instead of using cloth?
Well, i cant figure out why my cheddar is not binding properly after the second press. I am using fresh raw cow milk. The second batch i tried a fraction of the calcium chloride. That didn't work. Third time i used the recommended rennet but no calcium chloride and still not binding properly.  I have everything else exactly as you do. Any thoughts?
Whats your suggestion if i dont have a wine fridge to age my cheese but would still like to make cheddar? I would love to make it but i dont know how to age it other than the wine fridge method and my fridge is too cold I think and we're coming up on summer and it'll befar too warm to leave it out I think. Can you do it in the fridge? Do you have any ideas or suggestions? Or should I just do some non aged cheeses until I can affors a small wine fridge? What method do you use if not a wine fridge? Sorry for all the questions, me and my bf are cheese fanatics and i wanna try my hand and making it and you are like legend status when it comes to at home cheese maker's so that's why im asking you. Whatever your method for aging is  is the method that i wanna do if possible. You're word is the gospel for cheese making as far as I am concerned lol. You should write a book called the curd nerds cheese bible or something like that haha. I'd buy it!
Dang! I just realized I wasn't supposed to use the calcium chloride with raw milk. Ugh! I wasted 2 1/2 gallons of raw milk. So sad. The curds didnt mold in the 12 hr press all the way. Im so sad.😢 Is it a total loss? Can i vacuum seal it after drying? Im a noob!
What if after the 12hr press you can still see the shape of curds a bit but its holding together?
13:06  is this when you can wax it instead of using cheese cloth??
Ever use kefir for the culture?
Can I use thermofillic culture?
What culture did you use? Its so hard to figure out what cultures to buy
Love you video sir
if I follow this exactly, how long could I age this for? (without cutting it open, just leaving it) and what cheese do you think is able to age the longest thats also makeable at home? thanks 😀
Great Video and easy to follow for a beginner like me. What size mould did you use?
Damn i can't believe people in the old era would wait so long to eat a cheese. It's amazing all the preparation over Time It requieres.
Have you used kefir cultures? Or other instead of the mesophillic?
hi gavin! i made cheddar from raw milk couple months ago...and i just had a first taste...it tastes really bitter somehow. i don't understand what went wrong. i am a beginner at cheese-making. any ideas? fyi, i used raw buffalo milk, which generally has more fat than cow milk. i didn't add any bacteria culture though, as i had read and also heard you say in one of your videos that raw milk already has bacteria cultures in it...i only used rennet, and it curdled fine. i pressed the cheese and brined it, air dried, and then let it mature.  I read that bitterness is caused by peptides formation. any idea what could have caused that in my process? i'm afraid to try cheese-making again, from the fear that it will get bitter again. 😢 plz help me troubleshoot
sorry is the milk pasteurized?
So I'm assume you melt the lard as well
I want to get into cheese making. Excited
Can you post a link for the cheese cutter you use.  I bought one but it turns the whole curds mass and won't cut it right.
Great result and easy to follow video! I'd love to try making it at home, I'll try to improvise something for the press because I don't have one. Hope to return here after a couple of months with news. Good job and AC4U!
KA CA
5:35 mine didn't come out in a slab, the curds were settled in the bottom but they were all still separated, what did i do wrong?
im confuse when time did u on the heat and off the heat ..??
I love your videos! I've been making cheese only for a year now, but always struggled with getting my cheese curds to come out consistently. Through your videos my curds and all the others I've done have come out great!  I have the Paprika Caerphilly cheese aging now, 1 week to go.  Thanks!
Hello, thanks for the video I have difficulty to find mesophilic culture, can i get it from  a cheddar cheese mix with milk , let it rest 24 hours at 32°c and use that fermented milk as mesophilic culture ?  Thanks
In the 6:20 m. Do we leave the fire under the pot. And if there is no  fire.  How do we maintain 39 degrees
do you know what temperature you pressed the cheese at?
Me googling full cream milk lol We call it whole milk. Learned 2 things watching this.
Pofavor traduz em brasileiros não entendo inglês
Thanks Gavin!  My Cheddar came out great!  Used local raw Jersey milk, and doubled the recipe.  Can’t wait to taste it for real after the aging!
Should this cheese soaked into salt water?
Can I check this cheese at some point for flavour ect? I’ve never made a cloth banded cheese. If I cut into it, does it need to be vacuum sealed after? Or what would be the process?
Ok.. question if I may.. why did mine have a few lines and cracks in it? Smells perfect,  but I wanna make sure I didn't do something foolish.  I think it was a pressure issue from uneven pressing due to a cheap press
I came here because of an ifunny post
I am wondering about the smell. It smells a bit off as I’m taking it out of the press and leaving it to dry for 2-3 days. Is this normal and will it go away? I’m using raw milk

Thank you for your recipe 👍 made it so many times and always comes out beautiful and very tasty ❤️❤️
Annatto E160b are illegel for private to buy in Sweden even in rest EU. Is there some thing to replace it with or is it a one of kind ingrediense?
Say, gavin, how do you know how many pounds of force you are applying to the press?
Bravo
عالی بود
Oh, THAT'S what cutting the cheese is.
do i need to use calcium chloride if i use rawmilk in making cheese?
What is other cheese types that I can use cloth bound with?
You do a really bad job of saying when you have heat on or off on your stove. That's pretty important.
I hope to go to your country and learn from you, because I love you a lot
I love you, my friend, you are a wonderful man
i tuoi video mi fanno sentire come se stessi morendo di fame tutto il tempo! ne ho bisogno sul mio cibo!!!
I want to make that cheese but where can I get all these ingredients?
I want to start making my own cheese and seeing your videos just gives me a lot of hope! Thank you
This man is the Bob Ross of cheese making.  👌🏻
I love cheddar
I love cheddar shredded with a hot diced onion.
Where are the angry italians
Honestly I don't know why I started watching this, I don't even like cheese. There's just something mesmerizing about this nice australian man making his cheese. That being said it's kind of fascinating to see how cheese was made... I think I've become a curdnerd 🤯
Sir all im saying is your content is the best in the world i stay up until 5am watching you make cheese
Wow, amazing video!!
How did they have access to all these ingredients hundreds of years ago when they first started making it ?
I'm in Australia as well, where do I buy annatto and is there a specific type of mesophilic culture that I need?
Cheddar comes from.....................................Cheddar!
I live in Kenya - in a very humid hot area.  If I left this out on the counter - the temperature is about 95 degrees year round. Would that effect the cheese?  It’s also very humid where I live …. Could I let it dry out on the fridge?
Youre the Bob Ross of cheese
Dude, you are a natural.  No fillings. Smooth flow and clear explanation.
Awesome channel!
Love the recipe but technically if you've added annatto you've made red Leicestershire cheese. Which is still lovely like but there is a slight difference

Any changes to the process if using nondairy milk and vegan cultures/vegetable rennet?
Can i use pasteurized gallons of milk in supermarket?😅
Hi Gavin, so I have been following you and making cheeses for about a year and a half now but if I wanted to make say a double or triple batch of cheddar would I still press the curds at the same weight or do I need to apply more weight. Any advice is helpful. Thank you.
GAVIN .WHAT CAN I DO IF I HAVE A SALT INTOLERANCE ?  CAN I USE SALT SUBSTITUTE?
bloody good video mate keep up the work Big Gav im a certified curd nerd and im subscribed
If I’m using raw milk do I use all the same ingredients?
😎👍👌✌🖖🤓
A couple of ingredients that I've never heard of!
Hey Gavin I just tried this one yesterday and sadly didn't get good results. I used raw cold treated unpasteurised Jersey milk and didn't add calcium chloride as I didn't think it would be necessary, but after an hour with the rennet mixed through at temp I just had slightly yellowed milk. I used half a rennet tablet in water too, and the milk was about 4 days from expiry if those factors are important, if you've got any advice I'd really appreciate it!
Mostly we are making sheep cheese ,but this I will definitely try. Love cheddar and wine. Thank you.
Very cool! 1st time I've ever seen cheese made. 🙏
may i know sir, the target temprature depends on how many gallons inside the boiler? i mean like if more gallons in boiler so the target temprature also must higher? explain sir..
Love the way he makes the cheddar cheese in a simple way .. Amazing
What kind of mesophelic culture did you use?
I love your videos. The one thing I wish however is that you you’ll say whether heat should be off or on when the rennet is doing it’s work.
Can you do a port wine cheddar?
just woke up and the first thing i heard was "curd nerd"
Where's the angry Italians I was promised
Gavin, just wondering, could you use food color instead of annatto?
Wallace: get off me cheese!
Nice
greetings from zummerzet
About great video! I’ve searched all over YouTube for a video like this! Definitely a new subscriber!
What can be done with life left over whey
Sir quantity of milk and other ingredients like annato, calciumclorid, renet etc shoud be same as shown in vidio Or if it's varies will be ok
I don't make cheddar at home , but I really appreciate the amount of effort put into making it, Mature cheddar worths every penny.  Imagine that in my country the price of Hullomi cheese(prepared in couple of hours) is almost the same price as mature cheddar, it's insane.
Is there another alternative instead of the coconut cloth binding. Can I just put the cheese in a container at 50• degrees
How do you work so fast?  Or is it speeded up?
how do you know with your press if it is 25 or 50 pounds pressure?
I want to know how easy or hard it would be to make Brie cheese
Im brand new to cheese making and wanting to try this out. One question I have is when you "Ripen" the cheese is the heat on or off? Same question goes for the resting of the milk when you check for the break. Thanks!
i expect it is like candle making, you can never make it as good as a commercial product
How can I make a type of Yorkshire  wensleydale cheese please
Hi Gavin can you make cheese out of camels milk
Where are the Italians
Where the hell are all the angry Italians?

The cheese cave? 14:23
What number should the humidity be on the hygrometer gauge
Hi what is a cheese cave can i just store it in a ordinary container in a normal fridge at 10%
My cheddar, post-press, has some spring to it. Is that at all expected or did I over cheddarize it? I would have expected post-press pre-dried cheddar to be moist but unyielding
What's wrong with the cheese today it has no taste its also the same with big mak at MacDonald's its like a melted  yellow piece  of plastic
It's the movie "SLEEPERS" with Brad Pitt. The prosecution is really not wanting to win this, they just have a job to do.
Whoever thot of how to make cheese is my fave human. I love cheese man I love it
will olive oil work as well as coconut oil? I don't have lard either
I say ole chap I see you making a cheddar cheese
I heard that the original cheddar used marigold petals rather than anatto. Marigold also had a purpose that anatto does not. Have you ever tried it with marigold? Does it change the flavor or the behavior of the cheese any?
I know it's your style, but I almost couldn't listen as the church music was annoying to my experienced ears. Thank you for a great step by step lesson!
50°F at what humidity?  My cheese cave is 50°F@ 75% humidity, should this be ok? Thanks for the Fantastic Recipe and walkthrough!!
Hello. can we refine the cheeses under vacuum, in food-grade aluminum bags. thank you
I made a farmhouse cheedar over the weekend and as it was drying the top was cracking.  I only dried it for 12 house and then cloth banded it for fear of it getting moldy.  Later today I vacuumed sealed it.  did I do wrong?
I searched for this
Brought here by the algorithm  and I'm not dissappointed as a cheese connoisseur.
But how do you get the crystals to form? The only good cheddars are Cabot private reserve 16 month aged and some English thing I bought from Trader Joe's a decade ago. Cheddar without lactose crystals belongs in prisons.
I'm watching this because I just watched the episode of the walking dead when Morgan is  cured of his craziness by the cheese farmer. It made me think, " how is cheese made". So here I am
When it’s covered and sitting, is the heat on or off?
What is the substitute to cheese cave?
Hi Gavin - I'm about to start maturing my Cheddar cheese after cloth banding it.. does it need to go into the cheesecave in a maturing box or just "uncovered" on a rack in the fridge?  i want to make a variety of cheeses and they all have slightly different maturing temperatures ( 10 deg for cheddar 13 deg Stilton ) how do i manage this within the same cheese cave and to avoid molds growing on  each other ( though I realise Stilton will require a maturing box )
Why was the curd so soft that it's released in the whey during cheddaring process?
hm, my curd was still split up into little masses when I drained, maybe it wasnt quite warm enough under the whey. im trying the cheddering process with the many small masses I have, hopefully it works out. Thank you Gav!
Can we use lemon juice or white vinegar if we don't have rennet available in my country
Are you leaving the stove top on after you first get it milk up to temperature?
Can use Turmeric for color and it also helps keep dairy from causing so much inflammation and mucous in the body.
I have to say I am here for the angry Italians as well. But the video is nice so it got my sub
So I made the banded cheddar. It’s almost 3 months aged and I tried it. The consistency is great but the flavor tastes a bit powdery? Is this normal?
Did we all just come from Oz Media?
Can anyone explain to me the science of the Cheddaring process?  How exactly does heating and turning the cheese end up determining the final texture and flavor?
The French insist that Champaign can only come from the Champaign region of France.  A good while ago the Italians were in an uproar because the idiots in Brussels said every European could make Gelato even without making it with the fat content that the Italians would use.  So why haven't the Brits made sure that Cheddar Cheese has to come from Cheddar in order to be labeled as Cheddar Cheese?
second attempt:  I made Gavin's cheddar for the second time.  Practically, tho, it is my first attempt - I made many mistakes the first time I made it (my first attempt ever making cheese of any sort).  So, after aging just 2 months in cloth and lard at 55F I sampled the cheddar.  Whoa, mate!  It is very good. Gotta' admit, I'm proud of it.  Now, I'm aging it another two months, this time vacuum sealed.
Does the milk need to be homogenised?
Could you not turn the press upside down instead of removing cheese and rotating it. I have tried your recipe and enjoyed the results Thank you
okay but your cheese-making kit is A HUNDRED AND TWO DOLLARS??? think I'll stick with the Wegman's cheese counter.
???
I want details about rennet, culture, annatto,
1% angry italians  10% people talking about angry italians  89% people talking about people talking about angry italians
From Reddit LOLZ   Where my angry italians...Dammit
Looking for italians fighting
Came for the angry Italians, stayed for the cheese.
im here from reddit
Hi! Out of curiosity. How do you know how much preassure you are putting in the press? It is just by feeling, or maybe the experience over the years?
Hello Gavin! Will you make a goat milk cheddar and sour cream video please? My body doesn't tolerate cow's dairy anymore. So I'm looking to substitute all of the cow dairy products I've consumed my entire life with goat dairy. Thank You!
Hi there. I have whole annatto seeds. What do you suggest I do to extract the colouring out of it? Do I just boil or soak in water and, if so, how much and for how long?
Any idea how Belgian Passendale cheese is made?
I felt like I was at my church hearing the background music. Thanks for that experience with such amazing video at the same time
Gavin, these week I made your cheddar.  I have question.  It took me six days to place the cheese in the cellar of a friend (cellar is great - appx 55F all year long).  Over those six days, I worried about the temperature of the cheese.  Knowing nearly nothing about cheese making, I decided to take action!  I did not allow this cheddar to rest at room temperature. Rather,  I did an off-and-on mix of 12 hours room temp then 12 hours refrigerator in order to average appx 55F. Did I mess big time?  Would either room temperature or 37F refrigerator temperature affect the aging/cultures? Please and thank you.
In italiano no?
Hi, I actually wanted to know whether what machine you have used for the pressing process?
with 10l of milk how kg of cheese we have?
Hello. Mesophilic cultures are gas-forming or not, and do you need aroma-forming or not?
After putting the cheese cloth, you should put it back in the mould and press with the same pressure as the final pressure for a few hours in order for the cloth to adhere well to the surface of the cheese. You'll avoid molds growth under the cloth.
Mama Mia I’m a angrya Italian bobita boopy
Chedder from... From the accent I'm guessing Melbourne? Yummy.
BRING ME THE ANGRY ITALIANS
instead of coconut oil can I use Ghee as substitute for Lard
ahh i was thinking oh 13 hours yum but no 6-12 months awwwwwww
this is still boiling and not of the heat?
what the hell is cheese salt?
If you are using something like jersey raw milk, would you use calcium chloride?
My first cheese I did after 3 months was a bit like soft cottage cheese inside and smelt I assume it went bad.. I sterilised all equipment and wax sealed but didn't cheese cloth wrap and seal again with lard or wax. The cheese itself didn't look smooth when it was waxed like.yoirs and I wonder if I didn't press it enough to remove liquid? Was wanting another go and wasn't sure what I did wrong frost time as to.of to try again
I have been reading many of the comments and haven’t seen this question asked yet. Perhaps I haven’t looked back far enough. In many recipes you name specific cultures. For example, in Jarlsberg you list thermophilic MOT92. What mesophilic culture do you recommend for this cheddar recipe?
came from emkay
Should I use the fat from the raw milk that has coagulated at the top of the bottle?
💟🇩🇿
Can I do without the Annato?
Gavin- Good'ay!   QUESTION:  Is cloth binding with lard 🐖 or oil 🛢 an alternative to waxing 🦵,  or even vacuum packing?  Will it hold moisture in the way that all of those - and monitoring humidity - would?
I would like to know, when do you plan to restock your website with cheese kits?  Most of your kits are sold out.
My cheese is taking a long time to create a solid break. What would cause that? I am now on 55 mins for it to happen. Is my heat too low?
Curd Nerds😂Love CHEESE....especially melted
Greetings from Somerset, UK! We live about 15 miles from the town of Cheddar, so we get our cave-aged traditionally made cheddar cheese from our local deli. I found your video so interesting and inspiring. We are definitely going to give it a go at home! We’ll have to call it something else though, because over here in the UK it can only be called cheddar if it’s made in the town of Cheddar itself.   Cheers! 🧀
I better do this on a 21 days holiday  otherwise there wont be enough time  so complicated 😀
can this cheese be matured using the salt bath/rhinding method, without using wax/vac pack? thanks. x
Oh, I forgot to mention, some culture was always set aside and refridgerated, similar to what you wouls do for soure dough bread
Love it.  I once worked in a  Prize Winning Cheddar Chese factory, and the only deviation from what I remember and what you do, is that we tuerned the curd onto all 4 sides and continually drained the whey away to produce a dryer curd. it was  also pressed into S/S square frames that could be stacked for storage. Those that were intedend for maturing were then transfered into wooden boxes and stacked in a coolroom for up to 24 months. Most of the production went onto lined pale topped 44 Gal drums and  sent to Kraft and turned into blocks of Kraft Cheddar. See, it is made from real cheese. You have got me all inspired, thanks.
Thank   ALLAh  Then Thank  you  ------ There  is,not  translating  to Arabic
g'day curd nerds
Is he Australian?
Quick question folks if anyone can help. After heating for 40 minutes my curds did not reduce to 'baked bean size' did I not cook the curds long enough or too much? any advice would be great. Thanks in advance. Chris
This recipe works fantastically, but I now want to make 4 truckles instead of 1 large cheddar, so my question is simply. Is the pressing and drying times the same? Thanks again.
Milk didn't stop moving when he put the lid on
You're correct about it coming from Somerset, maybe even from the town called Cheddar ;)
Got a double ad, both about cheese so it's a net zero for me
Great :) Thank you for sharing, sir !
😉💖
Does full cream milk mean whipping cream or whole milk?
Only people who came here NOT for angry Italians are legally allowed to like/reply to this comment.
Do you leave the heat on after you add the rennet??
His voice makes me want to sleep so bad
Great channel Gavin! Just bumped into it today. Looking forward to the BBQd cheese video.... Webber.... lol lol lol :) :) :)
I looked up this video because I was reading Little House in the Big Woods where Ma Ingalls makes cheese.She would actually coat the outside with butter after sewing the cheese cloth on
Why do you cheesy people never talk about how to fermented cheese smells like vomit?
How much cheddar is produced from 10litres of milk, just curious
Do I have to use calcium chloride in it
WHY THE HELL DID I GET A STRING CHEESE ADD ON THIS BAHAHAHHAHA 🤣
Hi gavin, i have been using Raw milk, but, at the moment i can only get a standard shop milk [blue cap] full cream,, but it is only 3.7% fat. I want to bring that milk up to 4.2% fat.. will the addition of a few ml double/single cream be OK? As always thanks for any advice you have.
My father's 80th birthday - we made this cheese.  However, we missed the air-drying stage and went directly to aging.  Is this a big deal?  We have no idea.  First attempt ever at making cheese at home.
Neccessity
If I wanted to smoke the cheese, at what point would I do that? Thanks.
Watching people make cheese @ 4am>>>> btw merry Christmas to anyone that sees this 💗ily
cheese
Hola (:   I am trying to make this Mature cheddar cheese I tasted when I was in UK. I can't recall the name but that's first on the list when we are in the grocery store when we go back.   I know that the crystalized  bits are Calcium lactate .. When not adding in this substance does the calcium chloride & rennet combined turn into a Calcium lactate like substance ?   Also, How does this differ when using fresh milk.   Thank you for all these videos!  Can't wait to start my cheese curd nerd journey!  Especially because down where I am right now. You tragically can NOT find one single good cheese!!!!!!!!!!
ART
You have a great smile.
I save the bacon grease from breakfast in a mason jar, and use that fir my lard.
Curious whats in the jars next to the sink?
Can you use any shape press?  Im partial to a rectangular block.
This is amazing btw
I would never ever get it past the cheese curd stage!  We used to stop at the cheese factories and get fresh warm cheese curds right out of the vats.  yummmmmmm                             Cheese curds the real food of the gods!
What is the point of cutting up the curds? Why not just stir that sucker up?
Cheese making is the kind of thing you ask yourself: "Before its discovery, on a dairy farm, what the hell of an accident happened so it actually became *cheese* ?
A cheese noob question, what is the difference between a gouda cheese and a cheddar? To my untrained eyes and taste buds, they look and taste quite similar..
Gavin I love your style sir. One if these days I will build the courage to try making some cheese.
My wife is so proud of the cheddar she made with this recipe, at 8 months it's just an amazing sharp cheese. She'd already made a smaller 3" x 8" wheel of it and it was fantastic, so this last time she graduated all the way up to a 6" x 14", 15kg, waxed "monster" wheel (I did help wax it, because it was too heavy for her to dip properly). Thanks for these great videos.
This is soo satisfying. ✨✨✨
the finest cheese you can find is under his ring aged to perfection from decades of cheesemaking
Really good but I do think you should synthesize your own compounds rather than use shop bought chemicals 😊....
Hello.thank you very much for this recipe. Please Can i replace the annatto by another ingredient .and what's its role.
great tutorial but does anyone know where i can buy a large cave in sommerset?  checked amazon but they seem to be out of caves atm lol
Where to get Rennet in Canada. On Amazon it's very expensive
came for the angry italians, stayed because im angry and italian
while it ripening are you leaving the heat on?
Just waiting for my last few bits and I’m going to have a crack at this,it’s gonna kill me waitin 12 months tho 🤤
This was really cool! That cheese turned out perfect in the end! What is the maximum amount of time Cheddar Cheese can be stored and can it be waxed sealed? I know you said the minimum is 3 months, but would love to know the maximum and will I have to keep turning it weekly? :D 🧀
I enjoyed watching that. Some smoked salmon, a fine red wine and a box of veggie crackers will be in order in about 6 months. 😋
Absolutely beautiful! WoW!
How do you store the cheese once you've covered it in coconut oil? I've got this far and not sure where to put it. Although the coconut oil has hardened, it's still oily if you handle it.
If you don't add the Annato, does that make it a White Cheddar?
I just made this yesterday.  So far turned out nice.  One question though.  I have a wheel of cheese 6" x 3" thick.  Can I cut it into thirds and vacuum seal each piece for aging or should I age the whole thing as a whole?
First time cheesemaker here - and i made a mistake....... i used one teaspoon of salt instead of 1 table spoon. its been pressed and slightly air dried. can brining fix this?
Please list the ingredients here.
Aren’t you meant to use unpasteurised milk?
Is it ok if I added some hot peppers into the mix to get a nice spicy cheddar? Is there a technique for this? I've never made cheese and really wanna try it.
If you use chocolate milk do you get chocolate cheese?
What is the difference between cheese salt and kosher salt? Also can I leave out the annatto?
Til this day I thought you just put the milk into a container and leave it there until it becomes cheese on its own. This is far too much work for a piece of chese for me haha
Screw Italy and cheese, North Europe did more for cheese than italy ever did. They copies Asiatix people and bearrly changed. North Europe is unknown to most Americans that they make wayyyy better aged cheese on adv than italy (my opinion)
What vegetarian friendly alternatives to rennet would you recommend?
All right, I followed the recipe and realized after the fact that I only used two teaspoons of salt.  I soaked the cheeses in a salt brine for nine hours hoping this would help.  Yesterday was the second day of drying and there was an incredible amount of light fuzzy mold.  I panicked and sprayed the cheese with vinegar and wiped it down.  Today the mold was back but not as pronounced. I have wiped it down with vinegar again.  My first question is:  Is my cheddar cheese salvageable? The second:  If my wax is heated to over 220 degrees (f) will it kill the mold and keep it from coming back?
Cheese cave XD
👏👏👏👍👍👍👍👍
This is a 'go to' video for cheddar
Where did you get that curd cutter. I have been unable to find one.   Also thanks for the video. It is q huge help to a beginner.
Love your content, didnt kno there was a niche for cheese making😂
Why do i feel he made the meme that brought me here
Instead of lard or coconut oil can i use beef tallow? Thanks!!!
Very Nice and so Beautiful.
I have been cold smoking cheddar, mature cheddar and vintage cheddar for a few years now.  Just stuff from the supermarket.  Cut the pieces about 75mm wide.  How soon after making cheddar would you recommend for popping it in the cold smoker? Immediately or after maturing to the first stage or after each maturing stage?
Typ of calcium hloride?
thank you
I don't like
i never thought that i would love this but i do 10/10
Im up at 4am watching some guy make cheese. I have no regrets
Came here from emkay
g'day curd nerds
Came here from Emkay
what link do I order all these ingredients?
I FOUND IT
I think this is the best YouTube ever
Mama Mia you make a me as angry as a broken spaghetti
like
G’Day Gavin!   Jon here from West Virginia in the USA.  I really enjoy your cheese videos.  I think cheddar will be my first cheese that I will try.  You happened to mention in your Pepperjack cheese video that you were using the cheapest milk you could get, which was pasteurized and homogenized.  Would it be alright if I did the same with the cheddar cheese?  Many thanks!
FYI guys, you don't need to add annatto at all. It's just done to give you the look of very mature cheddar cheese. IMO it taints the nice clean and sharp flavor.
There are a few processes he went throw that really didn't need to be done. See if you can see the one's he used that you don't need too to create the same product. Good video. Thanks for the upload.
do you turn the heat off at any point during the process?
I’m Italian and this offends me
I like cheese sandwiches
How satisfying to make your own cheese!!   Thanks Gavin!  I'm loving this but my family are like, oh no, another craft!  So inspirational though as it's something practical.  LOVE practical so this could be something for our family.
Hi dear..Tell me where i can found recipe on link?
It takes me more than 1 hour for the curds to form .....
Eh this is too much step to make mac&cheese i wishh it was easier
Hello Gavin  Could you please let me know where did you get the cheese press or did you make it yourself.   Thank you in advance
Although I have never made cheese ,but this video make me comfortable and peaceful! Lovely 😊
Hi Gavin, thanks so much for the instructions! I have two quick questions for you:  1) Is there a difference in texture/taste between this cheddaring process vs the one you use in the stout cheddar?  2) Given your interest in sustainability, can you tell me what's the best option between plastic bottles vs tetra pak from an environmental point of view? Unfortunately the nearest source of raw milk is 30 km away, so I have to rely on store bought packaged milk as driving there regularly would defeat the purpose of avoiding packaging material.
Can I use gauze to dress the cheese?
Hi Gavin does the mold have a bottom?
Thank you Mr. Gavin
bruh where are the angry italians
WHERE ARE THE ANGRY ITALIANS
Somerset is my ancestral homeland dating back at least to the 1500s. They could have eaten cheese like this!
Where are my angry Italians
How much cheese can you get from 10 kilo milk please
I heard curd nerds and I absolutely love this man 😂😂
You sir, are the bob ross of cheese, it's one of the highest honours
Vaffanculo   Jk had to
G'day Curd Nerds brought me here through a Twitter link on Reddit.
my dude, ur gonna see some rise in subs because of the "g'day curd nerds"
Very impressive mate!!
Here after you became an internet legend for saying “good day curd nerds” 🥺💕
Thank you
Ooooh cheese lads
this is neat! going in my saved videos for sure
Hi please tell the method of making cheese using fig sap rennet
I was going to make a joke but decided not to say because it was to cheesy.
I don't know where to get most of that stuff!
What impact did the coconut oil have on the flavor of the cheese?
Followed this last weekend and ended up with 2 small cheeses of about 11oz each. Lard and cheese cloth on 1 and placed in fridge,the other I've started eating. Although young I'm getting the cheddar taste, can't wait to try the other after a couple of months. Thanks for this upload it helped a lot.
Hi Mr. Gavin, is the ambience of the room where you air dry the cheese important for bacteria purposes?  If yes, what is the best environment we should store our cheese for aging? In a simple residential house, where specifically is the ideal area the cheese has to be placed?  Thank you so much.
You are doing well all the best for you 👍🏼
Rennet is animal based or microbial?
Who makes cheese 😂
I’ve never made cheese so excuse my ignorance, after you add the first few ingredients you leave for 40 minutes, how do you maintain the same temperature? Surely the thing will continue to raise in temperature unless you turn it down in which case it’ll go down? Most hobs are just 1-6 on heat so you can’t really keep it at 31 degrees.   Again I’ve never made cheese or anything I just come across this video.
Hey Gavin, cheddar is actually made in a place called cheddar! There is a place called cheddar gorge where it all started too. Love the videos, and hey from the uk :)
the ingredients are intimidating.
Don’t know why I’m sitting watching a guy making cheese at 4am but I’m not even complaining it’s actually quite interesting
"Good eye curd nerds"😂😂😂😂😂
I'm just stay here bc 9gag
The comment section: now with 0.001% angry Italians.  But seriously, this is a very good video.
"Hey, can we have some cheese?"   "Yeah, it'll be ready in 3 months"  Jokes aside, good video
I would recommend Montgomery cheddar from the West Country in the UK - made in the traditional make process and will grace any cheeseboard.
I'm from Italy, we had a loot of cheese ! Usualy we eat emmental, but the cheddar is from uk too but ok mean America and ok is well, well a lot! Ok i'm going to buy Hamburgher!
No thank you, I will buy it from Walmart. End of story lol
Gavin, been using your recipe for 4 months now and just starting to taste test my cheeses, wonderful flavors and looking forward to ageing them more, keep up the good work !
Did this dude called me nerd ?
See how I made 43 cheeses in 43 days of lockdown https://youtu.be/fWtfiuGCy8Y
Thought it would be easier, seen a vid saying someone left a pale of milk in a cave in cheddar gorge and came back too cheese lol
Instagram said that there would be angry Italians Also this is cool! Thanks for teaching me how to make cheese!
Is any of the fats in the milk lost in the whey? Or do all the fats stay in the curds?
This Cheddar was the first cheese I attempted, followed your instructions. I waxed it and just opened it to try it after 3 months of aging. It is way better than I expected. Very mild taste after only aging 3 months. I made some minor mistakes (let the cooking temp get a bit high) but it still came out great. I graded a 1/4 of a wheel for cooking, sliced the other 1/4 for cheese and crackers and re-waxed the remaining half a wheel to let age longer. Great stuff.
I was told there was going to be angry Italian comments
I come heare bc of the meme
I'd rather buy it from the super market..
Good job
Are you using raw milk or pasteurized
Thank
Absolutely stunning wheel of cheese!
I just unwrapped and tasted my first cheddar attempt (started Sept. 14, 2019). I used this video as my guide. Overall I'm happy with it. The only cool storage I have is my refrigerator ( temp. is just above freezing). I used lard and wrapped like Gavin shows in this video. Wonderful crumbly texture yet melts in your mouth. It does have a bitter aftertaste though. I cut it into wedges, vacuum sealed, and back in the fridge it goes for now. Next cheese attempt: Parmesan!
During quarantine l learnt to make mozzarella, brie cheese, parmesan cheese and now Cheddar too
This is so interesting
Note anatto just adds coloring Buttermilk is the traditional starter for cheddar   Buttermilk =mesophilic yougurt = thermophilic
What kind of salt do you use? Coarse salt?
Covid19 lockdown here figuring out what to do with my expired milk! LOL
How much kg it was as a final product
What is annato
Everyone said they came here from twitter, am I the only one who actually looked this up? 😅
I got here from a Reddit post. I now live for this man
The most widely purchased and eaten cheese IN BRITAIN. but british always think they are the center of the world. tone yourselves down, guys, apart from this usual british dullness is a brilliant video and I personally love homemade cheddar... it tastes like ... any average cheese. Your channel is amazing.
Does double boiler mean something else in Australia? Where I am, it means a smaller pan, fitted onto a larger pan filled with water, so the primary pan is not directly on the heat. That's not what I think I'm seeing in this video?
I came here because of the twitter.... And found a place dedicated for cheese 🖤  Heaven on earth 💪🏻
Who is just watching these videos for fun but never gonna make the cheese?     Ok just me
The music makes me think I'm in church, like the music they play when the congregation is assembling or departing.  The church of cheese!
Wow it honestly is the biggest cheese flex to not have any mechanical holes
Only here because of a meme
Twitter sent me🦅🇨🇱
Here from Twitter for some cheesy goodness.
wow. amazing. I actually thought I could do this today but i release its a long long process
If someone travels with cheese, and it's sealed, how long can it stay  without being refrigerated?  36 hours?
Many  people here come because Twitter  😅 and mad Italians
Anyone else love watching these vids but have absolutely 0 intention of making cheese?
I came for angry Italians, but I'll stay to throw down some mad mozzarella sticks.
Came from twitter🙂
Wats out! Twitter 🐦 did the publicity  Where are the angry italians now?
As a Briton who lives in Dorset on the Dorset - Somerset border who has been to cheddar, I can confirm that this cheddar cheese is perfect, cheers to the mad lad, the lord of curd nerds himself. Came for the Angry Italians, got the cheddar 👌
On Quarantine too huh ?
Imgur got me here

Cheddar is a British cheese so should I be a token angry Brit/Pommie?

Everyone is on their way from Twitter. The Italians are not on the advantage here for obvious reason
Here because of the tweet and now I can’t stop watching
Let's go Italians hunting!
That's an absolutely insane amount of work for one small block of cheese.  I appreciate the effort you put into making this.
here because of the tweet
What's up Italians? does the quarantine have all of you guys so relaxed that you're not angry anymore?
I don't see any Italians but his accent is wonderfully relaxing
I came because of the tweet, but realized I've already seen this video a couple years ago

Idk how to say "go fuck yourself" in Italian but I'll know it when I see it
Ma dove sono sti Italiani?
Fuck off! You’re doing it wrong I know I’m Italian (there you go twitter people)
Did someone saw any Italians here?
Imagine this guy going through the comments and seeing everyone say “where are the Italians”
Twitter guy lied to us 😔
Has the Italians' internet access also been put on lockdown?
Y'all gotta go to the italian cheese videos you wont find italians under a video about cheddar lmao
No italians on sight. Looks like they're doing a good job with the quarantine

Come to learn Italian cursing, disappointed.
Came from reddit, no Italians
For those looking for the Italian's,  I'm here
I just came from Reddit, the fact that there are no Italians in the comments makes me very disappointed.
I just came from Reddit, the fact that there are no Italians in the comments makes me very disappointed, but nice video, I tried following the tutorial, pretty nice
Oh yeah....I just happen to have those ingredients in the cupboard !!!!
Finally your cheese is ready after two years 😂😂
interesting processes explained by a very good presenter.  calm and informative and isn't interested in being a whacky youtube personality which so many of the other food youtubers sadly are.
اتمنى يكون مترجم
Gavin, instead of Lard or Coconut Oil can we use olive oil or mustard oil? I remember in your next step video you mentioned that coconut oil didn't work that well. And we don't have Lard. So that's why I am asking this. Thanks
very tasty
Bravo
Do you let it ripen with the heat removed?
Cheese
Could I use bacon greas on the cloth banding ???
Great effort. Your voice is very calming. I can use this video for meditation :)
Love these videos. You have a great narrating voice! It’s quite calming.
Making a 6-gallon (22.7L) batch today!  Making one cheese a month for Christmas 2020 gifts.  Should be able to get two  2.5 - 3lb wheels of each.  :D
Wait, did he just poured whey down  the drain ? I heard you're not supposed to do that
Thanks from Finland for great video .is there any substitute for rennet for  vegetarians?
Newbe here. Is anyone else wondering what a cheese cave is?
Great video sir
Brilliant. His cheddar, crusty bread, Fuji apple, very ripe pear and a dry white wine all enjoyed outdoors.
Wow. I truly respect the procedure. Well done.
Good recipe 😋
Amazing
Good recipe 👍
this is not for a lazy peoples
I would never have the patience to do this. But I'm glad that someone else has :D
Thank you for algeria please traduction of arabic
Good recipe but i feel too lazy uncle
This guy has a very Bob Ross feel to him, its great.
What a fantastic video and wonderful video! Looks soooo yummy!
Hi. Thanks for all these lovely videos😍. I was wondering if there is a book with all the recipes.. because I noticed you use some book when making cheese.
This would go well with sweet red wine ❤️
I love 🧀
How long will this cheese last in the fridge once it's done?
Translate into arabic
i've found Gavin!
Aaaanyone else fucking lose it at "curd nerds?" Anyone? Just me?
Nice video... Looks delicious..  I'm going to give it a try myself...   :-)
can we make cheese without rennet n culture
Please translate your videos to us in Arabic so that we can benefit as well and thank you for the wonderful work ❤❤
I thoroughly enjoyed watching this but now I have no interest in ever trying to make cheese
Amazing Sir. God bless you for this channel. Simply amazing. Thank you a lot! ♥️🥂♥️
I have no lard but I do have coconut oil or beef tallow coco oil is cheaper( I will use inexpensive coco popping oil at $12 a gallon) will use that

Nice recipe Uncle
I read somewhere it was no no to put whey down the drain. Not sure what you are supposed to do with it though
I love it 🇩🇿❤thank you for the recipe
we don't have that kind of milk here all of the organic cheeses are ultra pastuerized
Where is the taste test video of this
Curd Nerds lol. I like that.
Hello sir. Did you taste snowdonia's cheese ? How do they make the wax around it? Is it the same method you've made on youtube?
The time of making this is not worth it
I really enjoy watching this presentation several times! I am waiting to do this exactly the way described. It will be a day I shall repeat again and again. Thank you for this informative presentation! 👍
I only have water from ingredients list..
I love cheese 😋🙆
Here you little bastered here's some cheese
9:30 - if you stopped there, would that be the cheese curds used in poutine?
Any dairy machinery only used please contact on my what up number 9028822279
That is epic. Can I ask where you got this recipe from?
Cheddar cheese can only be cheddar cheese if it is made in the caves of cheddar gorge
Would love to try this but where do I get those ingredients from?
my country is perfect for this because we nor have to heat the milk, the temperatures begins in 29 for the morning and finish with  40 for the night.
why are you putting all those chemicals there?
So my question is how much money would you save making it vs buying it?
Not sure if i will be able to find a spot to have 10*C for 6 months....
I never used cheese to suffocate someone, might go bad.
Gorgeous. Looks like around 2kg of cheese.
Blessed are the Cheesemakers..... Great video
you can't check the break with a utensil, you just had to put your finger in it! I may never eat cheese again?
nice one mate. i am a chef looking to improve my cheddar skills. just the pick me up i needed, hahahaha!!   if you are curious why i am called fishy phil it is because i pood in the middle urinal in year 5 and it smelt like fish also my name is phil so put 2 and 2 together
Very good job 👍👍
noooooo, do not discard the whey you moron! (i love your videos by the way)
You are the best cheese 🧀 engineer on YouTube 👌
I love your voice, its so relaxing and the recipe is amazing.
Great video, very informative. Thanks!
What's the total time taken for making this
Your voice is very relaxing.
thanks a lot

Where do you buy all the ingredients and the cheese cloth for making cheese. By the way I live in Italy!
My Cheddar has been vacuum packed for a few weeks now. I am seeing small dots of mold growing. Should I shave those off and repack it?
Je veux que quelqu'un me traduit la recette s'il vous plaît
Love cheese! I hope those rich enough are helping cows feel as little pain as possible! Cheese really helped my brain and body recover from being poisoned and starved! :)
when you press and air dry cheese at room temperature, what is the normal range for the room temperature?
Wow 😲 but where can find all those ingredients?  🤔
is this raw milk or pasteurized?
It would have been nice to see what “clean break” looked like.
Now that's real beautiful. For sure taste great.
What did you call me mate?
Big Smoke would want to know your location
Thank you.. i tried making the cheese today.. i hope it turns out well- the taste
Hi Gavin, did the coconut oil impart any coconut flavor in the resulting cheese?
Dude it takes 3 to 6 months to make some chedds... man I appreciate and love eating cheddar now I'm gonna sing to it and eat it with utmost respect dude 6 month to bite some cheese how do humans make these things like the person must of forgot it out on the ledge and been like oh crap I got my cheese out there still oh well I dc I'm eating it anyways and boom you got some aged cheddar idk man cheddar is my fave all i know
Dude with all food that has crazy process and recipes with the ingredients to stirring to time placement to letting it sit or heat it up cool ot down like wtf how do humans come up with these things its wonderful to see how just everyday food is made it boggles my friggin mind
After the 12 hour press, my cheddar round has a crest with some cracks at the top, I think because my follower's edge is rounded and too small. Is this okay, or will the cracks allow bacteria or mold to develop? If this is bad, should I trim off the crest to make the edge straight and smooth with no crest and cracks?
Can you provide a link for that cheese press?
About what size pot is that pot that you use for making cheese?
Awesome Video- Thanks a ton...love cheese...I have a new hobby that will pay for itself & make me popular at Christmas... will you make a video on Havarti one day?
Dear, Um from Bangladesh. Also a big fan of yours but i dont understand those things, what is anatto? Can't i add anything else? Where would i find out calcium cloride?
When curing for 3 to 6 months what do you use to keep the temperature at a certain setting
this 10 ltr of milk, what's the finally weight of cheddar cheese it makes?
How would I make this a white cheddar
Evening, Gromit.
I dunno how much we can trust this without seeing the final product.
Dear Gavin I am a big fan of yours from Bangladesh. I love cheese just as you do. Can I make chedder without culture and cloride while using lemon as rennet? Please reply.
Very interesting.  Could you stop mid way to come up with a soft product like soft mozzarella?
Your videos are so great, as a cheese lover these are really helpful and beats any show on food Network
never mind... I have my info... 😎
soooo... if in the wild... where does one get those ingredients?  from scratch so to speak. That would be a nice additive to the story and method.
I know you're not gonna wax the cheese but are you gonna cut the cheese?
Just watched this and now I want to make cheese. We’re do I even begin? I don’t have a cheese cellar (living in an apartment) but I have a lot of experience when it comes to cooking and preserving food.
Lovely voice x
I really liked this. :D
should the windows be open when I cut the cheese?
Guess that’s how I was made
Do you use raw or pastorized milk?
_I'm not dabbing im looking at the floor for cheese_
Wowww you know guys i want to watching this one because i wanted to know how to make
عمل رائع ولذيذ شكرا
Wallace would be looking at this video every second day
Ooh, lovely cheese
Hello this video is great. I wanted to know would this work in the country I am at the moment  I'm currently living in high humidity and appx temp in the day is roughly 32 c goes down at night but stays around 30c. Let me know I would really like to try this.
I love cheez
This guy sounds like the one narrating how it's made.
Whats up with the church rhythm in the background
tu mens
Just beautiful. Thanks!
*FATHER I CRAVE CHEDDER*
Dave Young I followed your recipe to the letter three months ago and I've just cut into my first home made cheddar cheese. It is absolutely beautiful and I could'nt be happier. Many thanks for the guidance.
Super explanation and i m proud of you
🤤🤤🤤🤤
just curious , what do you do for a living ??? (you know how you support your cheese making habit) 🖖✌
now could this cheese be aged for longer than 6 months say for 5 10 or even 15 years?
It’s 2 am and somehow can’t stop watching this guy make cheese
No hate, but you dont have lard because its not handy but you have everything else thats used for making cheese casually laying around😂
What's Calcuim Chloride use for?
Price-wise is it cheaper to do it this way to buying the cheese itself?
Did this man just call me a curdnerd?
When letting it sit out and air dry, is that outside of the fridge, or inside the fridge?
beautiful
THANKS
Cheddar is by far the best and most versatile cheese 👌
very nice. I have two questions please 1- How much cheese do you take out of ten litres of milk? 2- How could you tell 10 kg or 12 kg of pressure with that press?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DdC-g7vQz8  Six month taste-test for this wheel of cheese.
Fascinating!
I am still confused as to which rennet (animal vs. veg.) and starter culture to use for each cheese. Is there a quick guide somewhere? Thanks!
Youtube recommandations strike again
Podrías decirlo en español por favor
Give me some links for the tools and products.
👍🏻
Loved that wee video... :-)
Cheddad 🧀🦋🌻🐝🍒
Can I use any fat instead of coconut oil
I had similar things by boiling an old milk can I make cheese with this?
I can’t believe you let all that beautiful whey go down the drain, ouch!
I love cheese
Well it’s been 3 years so where’s our update? Lol
Well i translated the sub of your video in French, it shall be usefull for everyone :)
She took the cheese
We need you translate the vidio into ararbic
I just cut the cheese
Good job 👌👏
Thank mr, Gavin. Gran trabajo. From venezuela.
Would the cheese taste like coconut after?
this guys an asshole,,, go play with kangaroos ,,
Why am I here?         I am going to make these cheese and throw that to the area 51 soldier
Where’s the link to tasting video?
whey can be used for baking :)
Learn something about the dairy industry and lend a hand....walk away with a huge volume of milk and make a go at it.  The cheese adventure!  The directions are easy enough.  You might become a local legend for your area!
Great work sir
Most informative! Thank you so very much. Great video.
Hrrrrrnnnnnngggg shred chees
If I am reducing the recipe by half, will the pressure be the same? Am going to try this today but I can't afford 10qts of milk and I can't wait!
Wait.. cheddar is a verb?  That's awesome!
50 دقيقة بزاف  ياك الحليب ما يقعدش فنار بزاف ولا يفيض

Wow I just came from the GRASS man Now we making cheese. Earlier I watched a fish eat a fish What's next. ...
My first wheel of pressed cheese is drying now! Made this recipe with goat's milk from my backyard! Thanks Gavin, been watching for years, finally get to follow along!
Wonderful
imaging making efforts and wasting all that time and ingredients, and you failed at the end.. lmao
Gavin - Exceptional tutorial I must say! And I'm rather excited to try making my own cheddar now! First I need to find a source for a "cave". Do you have any information on this?  I'm also very excited to try making chevre. Do you have a video on this as well?
This is ridiculous. This recipe uses 10l of milk to make 1kg of cheddar. Since, like most people, I don't have a cow in my back yard (I don't even have a back yard) 10l of milk from the supermarket will cost me $22. From that same supermarket I can buy 1kg of cheddar for less than $11. What a waste of time.
Very interested, thinking of having a go . Is the annatto necessary ? It seems to be there only for colour .I'm a long way from anywhere to buy it , and while the annatto is not particularly expensive , the delivery cost is , so if it can be left out I will.
Can you do this with bacon fat??
Hey! Wow! Really great info! Tgank you si much fir putting up this video. I don't mean to be a bother. However, I was nyst wondering if there is no store to buy the materials, how may it be done on a farm naturally. I really want to know. Because, I just LOVE cheddar cheese. 💖🙏👑😋
turn into an old man just making these videos having to wait 6 months between
People discovering that cheese has to olden up xD  Quick society zombies like for real. they probably are unable to wait that their oven pre-heat so they just order the pizza instead of unfreezing one.
JUST FOR YOUR PRESENTATION I would like to give you an extra Thumbs Up. I love Cheddar Cheese
I would eat it the same day I can't wait
Who disliked this
Wowwww
Wow I thought I'd try this at home , was happily watching the video and noting down things but in the end he wait " and wait for 6 months" and there it is , screw making it I'll just purchase
Wow, it's only because of mass production that Cheddar is cheap. It's quite an involved process as compared to say pannier, hallumi etc. Ta buddy.
How things have changed over the years, i worked in a place called wolfen mill dairy in a small village called chipping, England. Family owned by Procters . I worked there for 14 years making cheese, cream and butter with the old wooden patts and vatts all hand made.
WOW!!
What do you call cheese that isn’t yours?        NACHO CHEESE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
i watched the whole thing impressive thank you i grew up near cheese factory it was right smack in the middle of nowhere squeaky cheese curds my fav thanks
Mary Belle:  Hi I enjoyed your video. We have Saanan goats and using the milk to make cheddar cheese. We are looking for a better type of cheese press. Where would we be able to get one like yours?
Interesting to watch and no doubt very nice, much nicer than supermarkets, but so time consuming.  We have a local stall in the market that sells really nice cheddar, much nicer than supermarket stuff, but a little more expensive.
This is so neat.
Two Clarifications needed Sir. Can we use DVT mesophilic culture. How different is it from the traditional mesophillic culture. The Quark cheese I did with the DVT came out superb. Also I've been using veg rennet for all my soft cheese. Can I continue with veg rennet for the matured cheese as well. Thank you.
tastes  like you fingers
Hey Gavin, I've made my first ever hard cheese following this video - thanks! After two weeks it is growing quite a lot of mould, is this normal and okay? I banded it with cheesecloth and lard.
I thought this was a quick diy but hell nah by the time i get to eat this cheese i will be out of collage like oml
Ok, I have a question on this one. How do you store it at 50 degrees for 3 months at home?  That is below room temperature and above refrigerated temperature. Our average temperature every day is 85 to 90 degrees, yet the refrigerator is 40 degrees.
This is the second video I have seen of yours the first one was American. Cheese as a brit I was wondering after you made my favourite cheese cheddar would you contemplate other great British cheeses. Like red Leicester or double glouster
Do you leave the heat on or not once you put the lid on?
Have you made a Muenster cheese yet?
Hi Gavin firstly thank you for the informative video.I have now made two cheddar wheels (I believe that's the right term)I've followed your recipe but when it comes to the mesophillic culture I have had to add two packets by Mad Millie instead of one is the reason because I'm using raw milk with a high cream content of do I need a different culture.Thanks once again  Big O. Cardiff (old South Wales)
dang what happened here! 3 million views
Hi sir can u show out for making mozzarella?
Is that nights in white satin in the background (minus the vocals)?
I am aging Parmesan in my "cave" at 52 degrees and 80% humidity, can this cheese go in that same environment?
Why add calcium chloride? Does it provide flavor or anything other than extra calcium?
If you are making homemade cheddar cheese at home, always wear gloves.
شكرا لك شاف
nothing this days is ORGANIC you not brains. last time we had something organic was back in the 60th after that everything went to hell. now everything is spray with chemicals, nano particular, the government  spray all the time the sky with aluminium, nano silver, nano titanium dioxide and whatever else they want. and all that shit goes straight to the soils. especial if you lives in the north america. and all those chemical are in the food suppliers, plus GMO so dont get caught in that shit about organic coz there is none.
This isn’t Cheddar.
Where do you store the cheese, couldnt quite catch it in the video, cheese case?
You mentioned your cheese cave. I've watched a few of your cheese making videos now and it's inspiring TBH. If I were to try this myself, could I let it mature in a temperature controlled freezer or fridge (i.e. like a fermentation chamber for beer)?
Any shortcut?
How on earth is this homemade with all those chemicals
Hi can you please explain exactly what the other additives are. Except for rennet as I know what that is
Chemical cheese!!
What should be the surrounding temperature during the cheddaring  process. As I live in a tropical climate, could be prone for a bacterial infection. Please do suggest
But this is not melt on pizza
Hi Gavin. Could I use a natural rock salt such as this from Tescos in the UK please?   https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/products/253729822
What would happen if you took that slab of curd and drained/aged it without all that cutting, reforming, and pressing?
very congested area
Holy shit it takes a lot longer to make than I thought.
I love it 🤗 thank you from Turkey.
How do get “old but clean” cheesecloth when it’ll be your first time?
Thank you much for this video, I made my first cheese ever yesterday with an improvised press sans annatto or a double boiler, your guidance was very helpful.
After you heat it up at 39 C are you stirring it for 40 minute or just rest it?
i would rather just buy cheese instead of all that work
10 litres milk = how many kgs?
Hi Gavin I'm here from beautiful Dorset UK. You have absolutely inspired me thank you 😊 10 LITRES???  Where do I get a 10 litre + double boiler please it seems HUGE?
I've never seen how to make cheese before. Thank you so very much. Amazing.
No lard? evil
Blessed are the cheese makers
When you put the lid on for 40 minutes to 'ripen', is the heat still on? How do you maintain a constant, even temperature without heat spikes?
just got your kit and it describes heating the milk using indirect heating.. putting the milk into a pot and placing that in a bigger pot that you fill with water.. how crucial is that in the process? i see you put the pot with milk directly on the stove.. i would think it would only have some effect when you flip the thing before pressing the thing.. so you dont fry it.. and hov do you messure the pressure you apply.. 11 kilos and 22 kilos..
Great video. You have given me the confidence to give this a shot. I will be back in six months to let you know how I did. Thanks!!!!
Traduction svp merci
Awesome video
when you did the Traditional method of warping it up,    Is that when we would wax it if we wanted to wax it instead?  Thanks.
when you heat the pot before you cut it in half, it had a certain setting on the stove.. you checked this with the termometer.. how are you confirming the temperature of the masses you keep flipping at 10 minute intervals in the middle of the video? if you dont turn the heat down i think you burn the thing.. maybe im missing something..
Wow... Yummy thank. You
Put milk in a pot, then let a cow crap in it.
Hi Gavin, I tried to make cheddar by following your steps (almost) and after 1,5 month I tasted it but it has a bitter taste and it has holes just like Emmantaler Cheese. What do you think about what I did wrong? Thanks!
I've never made cheese in my life.  I have no intention of ever making cheese.  *WHY CAN'T I STOP WATCHING THESE VIDEOS?!?  AND WHY DID I SUBSCRIBE?!?*
0:50 START
What is the yield for this recipe? How much cheese?
excelent explanation, thaks you very much for your work, keep on ,...you have a lot to share
Interesting. Thank you for sharing this.
Please answer !! what kind of rennet do you use
Why color getting yellow ?
Sir thanks for the great tutorial, I gathered all the gear needed but I realized that the cheese press I have will allow me tu use curds up to 6 litres of milk. Should I have to half all the ingredients?
sir can u explain what is Mesophilix Culture? - is it  calcium cloride same like baking soda or baking powder? - what is annato is it same as food colloring? thank you very much im very happy if u can explain it sir
Where's the tasting video yo?! ❤
Do you store it on the bamboo mat in the cheese cave?
I heard the Dragonborn ate like 50 of these during the fight against Alduin
Keso
Can't we use vinegar mixed with olive oil... instead of coconut oil
Awesome! Subscribed
Great hero 🙏💐
Can you use rennet tablets
At start of video: leave for 40 minutes   At end of video: leave for about 6 months
I had a stroke watching the salt
When do they put it in the kiln so the skin develops?
Good video
nice. looks great.
Mr.Gavin , can thermophilic cultre be used instead of mesophilic cultre for cheddar cheese.? Thanks in advance...
I like it 🎩🎩🎩👍👍👍
I would need an aging room that could hold 25-30 wheels.
I just found your channel : instant like and sub. It's so easy to understand a calmly spoken countryman. Thank you.
Hey Gavin! I know you say to start at 88 degrees. Im using raw milk fresh filtered from the cow. It comes in the door at around 98 degrees F. How important is the 88 degree mark? What happens if I add the starter culture when the temp is 94 F?  Any suggestions for how to rapidly cool the milk to the target temperature.  Thanks again, and love your videos!!
Hi I found cheese press hear - https://alcofermbrew.com/en/CheeseMaking/Cheese-Making-Equipment-c65c206.html  - May I use it?
I'm thinking of trying this great video I have access to whole raw milk.  I have a question wouldn't you want to get rid of the whey in the bottom of the pot during the cheddaring process instead of letting the curds sit in it or does the whey have in that stage?
I'm not thinking of making cheddar myself, but I am really surprised that cheddar doesn't taste as bad as other English food. The othe day I bought some cheddar at ALDI in Germany and I really liked it.
For consistency sake, since MA11 packets are sold at 50 DCU however the net weight is variable depending on manufacturer batch activity at the time of packaging, it is better to quote in DCU units. A derating curve is needed to adjust DCU based on age, I don't remember if I found one online or not. That way a customer knows that since he bought a bag with net weight 12 grams per 50 DCU and the cheese requires 1/8 tsp which is actually 200mg of culture, then it equals to ~4.15 gals of milk based on manufacturer's recommendation. However if the cheese diverges from manufacturer's recommendation, then to keep consistency and sanity, it's better to quote DCU per gal as the culture concentration, because weight and tsp quantities are highly variable based on desired number of bacteria per gallon to produce the right acidity in the specified amount of time.
6:13 brain
Thanks you very much for your help
Thank you!
Ok , I don’t want to make any 🧀.  Keep your secret with you.
I love Cheddar
How do you keep a steady temperature in though?
🌹🤩😘
Hi Gavin what do u call that  cheese using just milk and the rennet .and also when I use the rennet with milk temperature of 38'C the milk doesn't coagulatei failed that so many times .can u please answer me I live in Melbourne thanks
What are all the onions for?
Always brilliant.
Who cut the curd?
I hope your feeding that wey to a pig you've got in the back yard and not tipping it down the sink !. Regards from an old Pommy  b from across the pond.
Hi Gavin, where can we buy the ingredients? The milk and salt I can find myself, but what about the other things you mentioned?😊
Can I boil the milk and drink it steaming hot ? Then drink lemon juice and rennet and spin around and just make cheese in my stomach ? The reason I’m saying this is because I’m busy working all the time so I feel it’s better if I make it on the go ❤️
So has anyone made this cheese, and how does it compare to cheddar you can buy at the deli?
The bob ross of cheese
Huh. Didn't take long for that cheese to form, for some reason I always expected it to take longer.
5:31 noooooooooo, rip whey protein..
It's always fun watching how things are made. Very nice video!
Blessed are the cheesemakers...
What is annato
oh my gosh !!  I bet it is delicious. Thank you for the Video
great what about humidity
absolutely great video, please make more cheese videos. thanks for uploading.
Used your video, Gavin, yesterday to make our FIRST ever homemade cheese! What a great time to bond with my Dad waiting for the next step. THANKS for the great videos! We will be vacuum sealing the cheddar because we are so new and don't trust our cheese cave humidity. We'll let you know how it went in 6 months!
Where do you get that Curd Cutter
Thank you very very much
Come to Romania to see how the cheese is made.
Can you write it in franch
cheese  that curd cutter is a handy tool
I'm very Interested in this because i love being self sufficient but I'm curious about the aging process I live in Florida where the average temp is typically 80-90 degrees Ferhenhiet about 22 celcius for those not using imperial my question is what's a good way to age the cheese at the proper temperature and tips and help is appreciated
تسلم ايدك روعه بس بالعربي علشان نفهم فيه ناس ماتعرف الاعربي شكراً
to understand better if we were to taste the product post air drying and before cloth banding , what would it taste like
Thank you for the great video.
thank you Gavin, i learned a lot of your cheesemaking
Do you sell these locally Gavin?
这口音听着这个别扭
Looks like a lot of hard work,
Hi gavin you should try making Y Fenni it’s a welsh cheddar blended with ale and wholegrain mustard. I can’t find a recipe but I’m sure experimenting with the amount of ale in the cheese would be fun. It’s name comes from the town in which it was invented Y Fenni  is Abergavenny in welsh, it’s gorgeous in Welsh rarebit which is like cheese on toast but it has a béchamel sauce. You add the cheese to the béchamel sauce while hot to melt it through then pour it over your thick toast and then grill to make the best cheese on toast you will ever have
Good..  I'm following you From Egypt 😊👌👏
11 :52 u heard that spurs fans ?
Who watches this and then hits dislike bahahaha like my guys cheese game is strong
2019 anyone? Love this vid 😍
could you age this cheddar for longer such as 5 10 pr 15 years?
Wow! Hands down sir! 👍
is that whey water stuff, they use to make protein powder from?
Why the comments like 1 hour ago
I think I just curded in my pants
Can you replace the mesophilic dried bacteria with the buttermilk culture?
Is it better than the stuff you can buy?
So we also need cheese to make cheese .-.
This was incredible to watch, that takes such discipline
The curds in the pot looks like tofu
What milk full cream brand milk do you use for cheese recipe
Nice job
Hey i really like your videos. I live near cheddar, sommerset so its litrally the only cheese my family eats.
Wow
No
I have trouble with the rennet tablets as they grind into tiny pieces do not dissolve.  Suggestions?  (Other than purchasing it as a liquid?). You state in the beginning the type of milk, in the U.S., is whole milk adequate?  Thank you.

So relaxing videos
Hi great videos, when you rest the cheese or letting it set do you turn the heat off, or just maintain the desired heat setting
Who needs skillshare anyway?
Making Cheddar Cheese requires a long time of effort because you have to first go back centuries probably to pre-Roman times and establish a settlement that would eventually be called Cheddar. The you have to work forward.
Is liquid annatto mixed in water before being added to the milk just as the other ingredients?
Wow.  3  months enough ?
Do all your cheeses age at the same temperature of 10C or do you do different temps depending on the cheese? Also what humidity percent do you keep them at?
i have never wanted to make cheese in my life, but now i do
Hi Gavin, great video! I was wondering if the Annatto was required and where’s a good place to got the mesophilic culture?
Ok, I would rather just go and buy cheese
ممكن اشتغل عندك
سلام عليكم ان محمد مين الجزائر عندي خبر عن صناعة الجبن
Can we use home made rather than u use that 3-4 liq
My question her why u didn't pasteurized the milk first till65 70c
Go VEGAN. its not food. Its violence.    U murderers of baby cows
Hi there, very clear instruction. But I got a question, do you just leave it in the open air during the 12 hours pressing process? Because I'm from a tropical country and on average, a non-air-condition room would be around 77'F itself. I think I should put it in the fridge right?
Which mesophilic culture do you use?
I hope you washed tour hands 😜. Nice work either way mate👍
if you leave it as curd a dry it then squeeze it, would that be mozzarella or is it diff ingredients.
I misread the title as Cheesecake.
That was a lot of work.
I'm going to try making this one day
Ellerinize sağlık.  Çok uzun aşamalı emek isteyen bir peynir.
So much work!!! hah
진짜 손 많이 가네요. 정말 맛있겠다
🙌🙌🙌😍😍😍 wow
Hello Gavin. I tried making this cheese today. Everything was going perfect until I pressed the cheese. The curds did not knit properly. When I searched information on what I did wrong I found two things: First, I milled the curds with a knife instead of by hand which gave me too squared even cubes. Secondly, the curds were too cold when I pressed them. So now I have this wheel of cheddar with a bunch of un-even surfaces. So, my question is can this cheese be saved? I fear if I age it, unwanted mold and bateria will get inside the crevases of the cheese and spoil it. Thoughts?
what type of mesaphilic culture do you use?
make One kilo cheese how many litters need milk?
Fantastic can you make rommy chess??
Bloody awesome! Thank you for sharing this demo with us. If'n I start selling cheese, you'll get the first wheel, friend.
If I use 10L fresh from my dairy cow is it the same recipe?
This was really cool. Not a cheese maker by any means but I really enjoyed watching this.
Annato is only for coloring. Why add it? Faking color  seems superfluous.
Spoiled milk
Looks yummy
😋😋😋
Hi Gavin! As a part of my Computing and IT course in college I have to do a social media campaign for a company we have made up. The company I have done is called "Callywith Cheese Factory" and I was wondering if I had permission to post a link to this video to facebook and twitter?
"Thanks for watching Curd Nerds" no but seriously that was a very cool and informative video and your voice is so soothing
Voice is soothing bro 🔥🔥nice video
double boiler?
im not a nerd boi dont make me come overthere
love it nice video
A awesome video brother I’m a student but im going to most definitely try this out as a cheese lover 😂👍 keep up the great vids
That's great but I'm too lazy and can't wait that long.  Will just go buy cheese from market 😂
You eat it with cloth??
Thanks a lot
Soooo much better to watch yor video.some of the other channels go on and on.if you know what i mean
It's like a bottle of wine, good things need time
So just reading the description and i found out that most cheddar is white cheddar until coloured lol blew my mind considering i love cheese in general mainly feta and cheddar and mozza however marble to me is... different. Ive found it lacking flavor oddly considering i figured it had mozza and cheddar in it one of my two fave cheeses
Good
it is not so cheesy as it looks like
Hi Gavin, I’m going to get the hard cheese kit for my partner, what type of pot are using and do you no the brand?
Nice funeral music bro
the only thing i know n can afford is full cream milk😕
I officially identify as a curd nerd... don’t assume someone’s curdness!!!
That's a lot of work for the amount of cheese you get.  Thank god for cheese makers :)
من فضلك مقادير باللغة العربية
Cheddar have some vitamin K2.....witch cheese have more ? we import a lot of Kashkaval cheese, does it has vitamin K2?
havent watched a 14:50 minute video complete ever in my life! This is the first one
I apologise if this has already been asked, but do you have a reccomendation on some sort of cheese fridge or something of the sort to use to age the cheese and keep it where it needs to be in terms of humidity and temperature, thanks gavin i loved the videos just subscribed
Now I know why cheese is so expensive.
Oooh~ This seems interesting and tasty!
Howdy, I had a crack at this recipe after watching you 4 months ago and the result was awesome, so happy and now have 2 more on the way. Easy recipe, great clear instructions and visuals, great work, now have to explore the rest of your stuff. Many thanks
When can u start eating it
Great recipe.  Almost like tufu
They pigs love the whey I don't use for other baking products.
why does everyone dump the whey down the drain
Cant wait to try! New sub👍
I like how you had liquid rennet, Annatto and Mesophilic culture in, but no lard.
Although i may never take so much pains to make cheese, a big thumbs up for the effort and time spent on preparing it.  Truly awesome...i will bite every bit of cheese with a little more respect now 🙂
لو حد هنا عربي يفهمني 😉😂😂
I cant wait coupel of months for tasting it  But it was nice sir
If I want a spicy cheese can I add a small amount of ghost pepper powder to my cheese and when
What if I don't have a cheese cave i live in Nebraska USA it is a lot like the out back in summer here and like arctic in the winter we have one if the largest temp difference in the world season to season so how can I keep my cheddar cheese good
Is thiz a chemistry class!!!.. I absorbd U hv repeatedly adding one particular ingredient frm beginning to end for tiz process -" Patience "...  Great job......
CaCl as a vinegar ???
Did you call us "curd nerds" 😂
Awesome video
A big bearded fellow, he just loves to make cheese. He is kind enough to show us how to do it. It's all hilarious and i'm very grateful for for it :) Love you Gavin
Can i use olive oil for banding? I don't like lard and coconut oil
great job!!!
We're living in a cheese state #cheeseinspector
Best video 4making hommade cheese
What is a cheese cave? I have a cellar and a fridge, The cellar is over 10 degrees Celsius, the fridge lower. I am not a professional Cheesemaker or dairyman.
I love this video. Encourage me to make my own chedar cheese. Thank you.
Best video on Cheese making
"When it's in the cheese kay"   What's a cheese kay?

Can you mature cheddar for too long ?
Really nice no-nonsense tutorial. Thank you.
Tomuch ingredients and lot of work but we eat faster
I could scran some cheese rn
Way to much work. Just go to your local grocery store and you are able to buy cheddar cheese already made & ready to eat.
Gavin can the process of cheese making begin with using store bought cottage cheese and seasoning/flavoring, then pressing those curds?
I don't have a double boiler set up large enough to hold the 10 qts of milk, can I heat it over direct heat?
it would be nice if you showed ussome of the finished products
If someone might settle something for me, I'd appreciate it. I told my roommate that I'd like to try my hand at making cheese. He said "Oh, you want our house to stink?" I said "Oh, you've made sheese? You're a cheese maker? Please, tell me all about it." He then explained to me that cheese is made from smelly stuff as though he has some kind of personal experience with it. I'm hoping he's wrong just so he might learn not to talk about things he doesn't know about but honestly, I don't know. So, I'm not speaking about Limburger cheese or anything that's notoriously smelly like that. Just something like cheddar might be a nice place to start.
It would be nice if you’d explain some of the ingredients for newby cheese makers.
what was the end weight of the wheel?
At the only cheese company still in the village of Cheddar, they cut and stack the curds. The weight of the stack hastens the release of whey https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJi8WgcNSvg
Ratatoullie
I always wondered why cows in America give orange milk...
During entire process do we have to keep the gas ON or shut off
Knp ada yg disslike?
WHATA CREAM ?
Follow me on Instagram @eddycheddar
Wow, hard work never goes to west,  nice recipe
Damn, is the whey still edible after?  If it is what can I use it to make?  It hurts to see all that whey being thrown away😢
I think Dislikers are master cooks? Who thought curd has cheese
THANK YOU for speaking. Youtube is getting to be the "silent movie" channel, with nothing heard other than dreadful music or, heaven forbid, computer generated voice.
nice low temp cheese the more raw the better.
Can we get all the ingredients written please and the measures....
did the drops of annatto could be replaced?
Wawww mmmmm
I better buy one...
what is the calcium chloride for?
It's 4:30 AM, but I want to make cheddar cheese now
Can we use yoghurt instead of mesophilic culture?
I know you called your 1 year old cheddar vintage, but how old do you think a cheese could mature before it was deemed inedible?
Toop
Why do you make it? Would it be nicer? Cheaper? In Australia we can buy cheddar for $6 per kilo. Milk costs $1 to 2 per litre
nice i love cheese
Do you keep the milk at the target temp for the ripening process and while you add the ingredients?
I want to make this cheese but I don't have some of the ingredient. :/
I found this video a bit cheesy.
Amazing video thanks for sharing x
Love all the explanation! Great work.
Can this recipe be halved?
I couldn't quite understand what was said about where to store it for 3 to 9 months!
Could you please tell me what weight/spring/pressure would I use for a mold which is 25 square inches and same volume of ingredients, thanks ? Fab video !
Great Video! I have just made this and it turned out great!
OMAYKAT WOW CHECE
I is a curd nurd ^_^
I m sleepy
So two hundred years ago they were pouring calcium chloride into their milk? How do I make real cheddar, not chemically catalyzed cheddar?
Can you do a video making Cheddar with buttermilk? I am having a hard time finding a recipe for buttermilk cheddar.
it seems like magic
Wow!  That cheese looked fabulous!
10 liters milk 😅
13:04 you said you was not going to wax it,  you was going to do the cloth way.   I would like to do the wax,  So is this the time you put the cheese wax on it then store it at the  10C (50F) for months??   Thanks ahead of time for the answer.
Hello and thank you for great insturctions!  One question - is this cheddaring procces of resting in the pot for the bacteria to germinate and propagate?
You are the bob ross of cheese.
Yes Chedder Cheese comes from Somerset my brother in law makes it.
This video was cheesy!
I just use a grater on my heels and i get tasty Parmesan for free!
My daughter is allergic to dairy
Asombroso!
Me encanta rl chedar , seria usted tan amable de poner los ingredientes , en espsñol? Gracias y un saludo desde españa
If it isn’t stored in cheddar gorge then it isn’t cheddar. Lard > coconut oil = bastardised
The orange coloring ruins it
I made my first cheddar yesterday following this video (well done video by the way!).  While heating the cut curds the temp accidentaly got to 40 C or 104 F near the end of the process for about 5 minutes - with this kill the mesophilic culture?  The cheese looks beautiful this morning after being formed.  I sure hope it survives!
oi
when cheese become 6$
is it possible to make it with raw milk without heating it up? i mean without pasteurizing it.
Great instruction video ! I feel like trying this. We have an urban farm store here so I'll go over and see what I need. Thanks!
Now when you say full cream milk, do you mean milk that hasn't had the cream separated yet?
انجب
How much cheese does this make?
If you are a strict vegan, try to find vegetable rennet. The standard type is extracted from a calve's stomach after slaughtering.
As for the milks you use.  I'm in the U.S. what are the milks you use, as to our milks ex.) Whole milk, would that be your full cream milk?   Ive just started exploring cheese making, so I have a lot to learn lol. Thank you for your videos & information.
Why not get a motorized stir bar?
it’s like an asmr
I really liked this video. Thank you for making it.
What I can't understand is how do you keep it temperature controlled during maturing? I can't figure out how to keep a place at an exact 10c for 3+ months straight.
can you make a video on how to make the whey riccotta you mentioned, I need to know what tomake with all that whey! no whey would I dump that down the drain!!
Where can I get a cheese curd slicer?
I guess cheese is spelled p.a.t.i.e.n.c.e...wow
calcium chloride is salt right?
Love to make , hate to wait.
Yes lad
what cheese press is that you use and do you have a link to order one of them
I guess it’s all about patience lol
Thanks Gavin! Awesome video. So smooth.   Haha keep up the great work 👉🏽👉🏽
Dude, recycle your whey!
I finally have a cheese guy.
You australian?
Excellent! This is such an inspiration to get me started making cheeses. Surely subscribing your channel where I have a lot to learn from. Thank you!
Hello Mr webber I just need to know if the finally cheese has a same weight of all different types of cheeses  Thank you I am happy to know
Hello Mr webber I am from algeria I want to ask you What is the weight of cheese in kg for 10 L of milk  Because I want to begin a business in your way
Wonderful videos. Thank you so very much.  Can leave out the calcium chloride?  I am anti-chemical things...
Wow
Where can you buy the ingredients?
ياليت احد يترجم  مشكور
Why not drain the whey while in the pot @105F
😍😍😍😍 I want some
My goodness,...that is quite a process, but it looks like fun and ultimately, what better reward could there be in life than........CHEESE! Thanks for posting.
I'm officially a #curdnerd
Once you've let it acidify for 40 minutes, do you turn the heat on again, or are you adding all the other ingredients to the somewhat warm milk?
Congrats on 100k!!!
Good job *SIR*
And now my stomach is growling for cheddar !
Beautiful video.... Indeed a lot of hard work and appreciated
Is that a New Zealand accent?
Hello from 🇨🇦. When you list cream milk, is that a cow or sheep? I’m more interested in using sheep milk, if possible. Thank you sir.
This dude keeps cuttin the cheese right in front of me.
Man I love cheese! Maybe even more than Wallace and Grommet lol😆 is there a way to grow your own home made mesophilic cultures?
Thank you
Subbed You
Best Video when the video started you were a little bit scared I noticed it Its Okay
This mans voice will put anyone to sleep
amazing... beautiful video shalom from Israel
I really enjoyed watching this! Trying to get into homemade cheese making, so this was very helpful, and such an enjoyable video to watch!
Sir this how much money what price
Sir this very nice.i want you gave me mobile number
This is a great company in Qld Australia, I buy my Soap Making ingredients from here. I’d much rather make cheese to use for my family and to sell it at the markets.. think of all the money you can make, and you’d appreciate the cheese more if you’ve made it yourself and you’ll see what goes into it with no hidden ingredients. #thankyou #littlegreenworkshops
Damn, I think I would rather buy Cheddar. :/
Cool!
nice sir
Hi, where would one get the ingredients to make cheese? Obviously milk and salt I can get, but rennet, culture starters etc? Thanks in advance
Chos
That was inspiration!
Hey Gavin! I love the calmness you bring to the video, it's really a pleasure to watch. Also of course it's really interesting learning about this! :D
Wow weldone, easy to to follow process, I will try one  Thank you
I have work due that counts for 30% of my mark and im watching how to make cheese
I'm a just a little confused. When did you turn the heat off the first time? You mention turning the heat back on when you cut the curds, then, again later, while cheddaring.
excellent video
This was cheesy
damn, that looks good!👍
OMG no wonders I love the most extra sharp cheddar! It is so labor intensive and the patience you must have for it to age is outstanding! I could not do it. I wouldn't have the patience. Great vlog! Thanks. I know now not to try and do this on my own. But I commend you. Will wait for a local cheese maker! Lol.
Awesome video honestly idk why but i love cheese.
odlicno uradjeno,stvarno dobro objasnjeno i pokazano,bravo za majstora!
Elegant.
now I understand why good cheese is so expensive, it takes lot care and attention. Thanks
You made me want to be a curd nerd Gavin.
What is cost of making?  And how much you sell it?
It’s 4am, I’m still hungover from the night BEFORE and I’m watching a dude make cheese on the Internet.  What is life
Guys if you are vegetarian please don't use natural rennet because natutal rennet is extracted from cow's stomach.
Niiiiiiiiiiiice👍
im getting McDonalds anyone want some?
very good job
Thank you,,
this is ASMR to me tbh
Thank you! I’m really enjoying your video
very nice. i will look your videos for the taste test 6 months later. ;D

So i started off looking at homemade hams and now i know how to make cheese to go with it 😁 can't wait to get started
حدا يترجم للعربي بليزززز

Oh very difficult to prepare
That was art!
Some ingredients are hard to find in my country so don't you've any simple recipe
I work at Mariposa Dairy, we make 2 year aged bandaged goat cheddar! Interesting to see how cow cheddar is made, a very similar process
Full cream milk? Is that whole milk?
Giving my first cheddar a go today...hope it goes ok 😓
This is so amazing 😍
Nyc
The best cheese to have on a cheeseburger.
WoW ! 💫
woh! can u actually hold the cheese & flip it over after 10mins boiling ? ♨ ... whoah!😨
what's rennet ? .... does it have any common name ? ... what's common substitute for rennet ? ... have a good day & thank you 🙏
any other name brand for calcium chloride?...sounds like a toothpaste 😨 ... whoah 😵 ... peace ✌ .... just sooo soo 💕 love cheese ... 😋
Love the editing!
COCONUT OIL IS NOT A GOOD SUBSTITUTE TO LARD! HOW DARE YOU SIR! LOL 😂 BUT SERIOUSLY PEOPLE LET ME TEACH YOU ALL AN IMPORTANT LIFE LESSON...PLEASE NEVER EVER EVEN ATTEMPT TO TRY AND SWAP LARD FOR COCONUT OIL!
Chiddah?
I finally know what curds and whey are.  But who sits around and eats that? Why couldn't she wait for the cheese to be made?
Por Dios... Dónde consigo un vídeo de cómo hacer QUESO CHEDDAR CASERO, pero, el vídeo en español... O el vídeo doblado al español. No entiendo NADA...
Are you sure you know what you doing?
are cheese curds tasty?
I watched this while eating Old Croc extra sharp cheddar cheese. I love cheddar cheese. The sharper the better.   April 22, 2018 1:36 am
Hey Gavin, just wondering if this cheddar is aged in a maturation box or put straight in the cheese cave on a rack? Thanks for the great videos!
Why am I watching this at 2 am
That's neat!  Now I know the process and what it took to make my once upon a time favorite cheese!
yA LIKE MY BANGSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
I really like my cheese REALLY YELLOW.
I love cheese, but this seem very labor intensive!
So is "full cream milk" the same as raw milk?
Very interesting!   My grandparents always made their own cheeses and sold them in the town they lived in.... As kids we use to take little bites out of the "green cheese" and my grandmother thought it was so funny that we were eating the "green cheese" lol
Yicyhujgxthiggg😁
So soothing watching you make cheese my friend
Sir is it possible to learn from you practically. like 5 days work with you in your farm.please sir let me know.
RESPECT . BRAWOOO
Hello mr Webber, i love your videos , even though am new to the cheese making field but i find a lot of satisfaction doing it. Now am going for my first hard cheese and i do have a question hoping you can help me. Am doing an 8 liters of milk and I have dry form calcium chloride, how much do I need for that? Please reply and good luck on your next cheese making tutorials. Thanks Sharon.
Cheddar is an English cheese, but is is named after the cheddering process, *NOT* the English village, which has no connection to the cheese... The cheddering process is a weighting/pressing process (which you got wrong, btw) where the curd is cut into oblong shapes and stacked on top of each other in a # sort of stack, and rotated from top to bottom (do not let it sit in the whey).... Afterwards it is then done as you did.
Hi. this is very nice video. I want to try. Thanks a lot for sharing this video
i'm from america
Is beef tallow/beef fat an acceptable substitute for coconut oil?
Thank you!
Everyone knows that Cheddar Cheese is dug out of the Cheddar Gorge Cheese Mines. Do you honestly think I'm daft enough to believe about it being made from milk and rennet?
Do you have to wait that long to eat the cheese?
Very nice wonder ful
thanks for thiq
THX neighboor :)
I love Home and A Whey
When you sanitize with white vinegar, do you dilute with water or use full strength?
LOL!!! Dos't he mean "HOW TO MAKE CHEESE"!!!!! Cheddar Cheese is only made in "CHEDDAR"!!!!!
Oh.. What a horrible innings by DK...!!! superb knock...
I love cheese!
can I get a bite?
Awesome video.  Every time I eat chicken I cannot do number two
How much cheese does 10l of milk make, (weight)
What determines the sharpness of a cheddar?
Is this the annatto you are referring to? https://rover.ebay.com/rover/0/0/0?mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fulk%2Fitm%2F272259632891
I just found your channel and it's getting me really excited to try making aged cheddar. You make it look so straightforward, but what issues would a newbie have attempting this? Honestly, I'm not even sure where to get the right milk!
When he speaks of full cream. Milk is he meaning full fat or fresh milk straight from the cow. Or goat
hello! why do you drain the whey to the sink? Isn't that reusable and nutritious?
i love to make any food myself, because i have some problem with factory made food, this is great but , i'm quite shock because it's to much work and time to make this cheese...
Do you ever use all natural products? I would love to see a baby swiss butter cheese... It is delicious!
who even owns all this cheese making equipment.....I mean other than sir Gavin obviosuly
hmmm
did he just call me a curd nerd?
Gavins cheese is my cheese.
I have a question...does it matter if you use animal or vegetable rennet? What kind of difference do the 2 make in cheese? Nice video here!
Hi Gavin, love your videos! I watched you stir the curds and man am I doing it wrong! I'm always afraid to stir. Are you using pasteurized milk or raw?
Wahabi its not rude its HONEST comment
stupid not telling when to switch off stove or when to switch back on !!!!
i love cheese <3
I'm impressed with the cheese you made. I do have a question, can I contact you on email? I've been making mozzarella cheese since. But with all the ideas that I combined with mozzarella, is really hard to make it. Maybe if you can give me a solution. Thank You
Hi Gavin, is there is difference between rennet and rennet from concentrate ? Or is it the same thing ?
we don't love your cheese
Sorry I don't know what some of those ingredients are or where to find them 😑
If you can get enough try it with bacon fat
Are you serious this is the most eaten cheese? I tought parmesan cheese or mozzarela were the most eaten cheeses. At leasti like them more.
Where the hell you get calcium chloride from
What I have now is Mesophilic Aroma type B. Can I use it for making cheddar?
Awesome.
What is Annatto ??
Sitting watching this video outside a cafe in Cheddar, Somerset with brilliant blue skies and sunshine. Really enjoyed it - thank you. (But will be heading into the original Cheddar cheese shop as soon as I’ve eaten my bacon and cheese sandwich. Happy days.
Beautiful cheese. I need to make this specially since  I want to move to the country side.
Hello Gavin! Thank you for your informational videos! Exactly what I have been looking for! I have two questions. Do you think there are any additional benefits to suctioning out the draining wey during the turning process? I was also wondering if I will need to change the recipe at all if I don't care about changing the colour? May I just skip the step where you add the annatto/water mix? Thanks!
nice tea kettle, I have the same exact one...
It’s 11 at night and I’m watching a man make cheese
What I need to know what is a cheese cave I was hoping he'd show it
can you do this with the milk in the US or Canada? it's all pasteurized.
Am i seeing things or did he just chop liquid ?.
I don’t know why I watched this video at 4:45 AM but sir, respect! Really enjoyed.  Loves from Azerbaijan <3
it looks like you enjoy making cheese more than what you do in your day job.
Could you keep/propogate the culture by dehydrating one of the cheese curds?
SPACE. the final frontier. These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilisations. To boldly go where no one has gone before.
We love cheese on top of everything.
I think it is a great investment to make if the time allowed.
Too much time consuming. Too much work. I'll be getting my cheddar cheese from my neighborhood grocery store.
Damn, I need a cheese cave. Cheddar is so damn expensive over here it will return it's value within a year :)
After watching this video and the process of making cheese, I think I'll head to the supermarket for  cheese. Great video though.
That is truly a labor of love
Im gonna try making mozarella first since cheddar takes a thousand years and also because instant gratification hohoho. Thanks for the video its highly informative and you sir sound like you could be a sports event/channel commentator hahaha i loike
Well, I was following your recipe/instructions but after I added the mesophilic culture the temperature rose to about 100 F.  I let it set for 10 minutes stirred and let it rest for 40 minutes.  I added the calcium chloride and 1/2 tab rennet but it did not set up.  I added the second half of the tab and am now waiting for a second 40 minutes.  Can this be saved?
How did the first person think of this?
Please show us a pic of it after 3 months. Want to see the end product. Btw. Beautiful video.
Great video. I'm just a dumb American and always heard about "curds and whey" but was never sure what they were. I was surprised the whey was discarded. We only have a history of 400 years, but you cheese makers with thousands of years of history, you never found a use for whey? Just mostly water? Thanks.
That's awesome!  I love cheese!
After milk is at 31degree C do i need to off the heat and mix other ingredients and keep for 40min? I always get confused on that. Pls help
I like cheese
A lot of effort goes into making cheese at home
you sir are an artist.  amazing video.
Anyone else bit sceptical because of how many chemical substances he is using
Excellent thanks!!!
Cool
awsome vlog !!
I always thought the process of pressing the chunked curds together was called the ‘cheddaring’ process. I had no idea it was the last part of getting the whey out. This video has inspired me to start making my own cheese and to strait, not with what many would say is the “easiest” cheese to make, mozzarella, but with the best cheese, CHEDDAR!
Can you use a salt bath for this cheddar instead of adding salt?  If so what is the ratio of salt to water?

Why not buy cheese? 😂
how did you maintain 10 degrees Celsius..??   i have a wine fridge....will that work....and what about humidity levels....thanx..:)
What is a double boiler...could you show it please in more detail thanks..:)
Sorry for my ignorance. In my part of the world, there is no such thing as "Full Cream Milk". What is it?  I have access to raw cows milk, but on the recipe page, you write that "pasteurised/unhomogenised" is preferred. Where I live, my local grocery store sells raw milk and milks called "whole milk", "2% milk", "1% milk", and "skim milk" all pasteurized and in both homogenized and  not homogenized. I think the percents are for fat content. Do you have any educated guess as to which milk I should use for this cheddar?
would skipping the annatto effect anything besides the color?
Thanks from France for this amazing video !
Hi Gavin, the rennet that  you are using, is a  standard calf rennet with 1:10000 strenght? Thanks from italy
Are you on good drugs or are you just naturally, yet unusually patient?
Magnifique
R u jewish
hi Gavin , i made the curd cutter works beautifully , so when i check my curd for a clean break it looks perfect after letting it sit and mend for 5 minutes i begin the gentle stir and it turns into slop rather fast with a few remaining large curds any insight and also my finished product stays white as the driven snow not a light butter yellow color .
Is there any thing you can do with the by product of whey? Thanks.
not worth the time taken!
Very informative, easy to watch and learn.
Hi Gavin, if you were going to add truffle to this would you do it during milling?
Mobning
I like the Australian accent a lot , it’s like music to the ears , while watching how to make cheese .
Damn that’s pretty.
Of the best european guys ive ever seen on youtube
hi, i am inspired by your cheddar cheese video - can you tell me a bit more about the large pan you mix everything in - i think you mentioned bain marie - is this pan a special one with that incorporated, or what have you used please?  thanks
Thanks Sir! So helpful 👍
Ma vai a cagare!!!
Damn, watched the whole thing and then heard at the end it needs to mature at 10°C.... As I live in Thailand where the average temps ate 26-34°C I guess I wont be making home made cheddar :(
what temperature is it left to mature for three months or more?
It increases the flayvor 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
So satisfying to watch... can't believe you threw out all that whey! It's such a healthy drink and it does wonders for your liver.
Great video but one question.  When 1st target temp has been reached, do I need to keep at the target temp until ready to do the slow temp increase.  OR do I let it reach 1st target temp and then remove from heat while adding all the other ingredients, and allow to cool, until ready to increase target temp to 39?  The reason I ask is that at the point when starting the increase in temp you state to put the heat back on, this implies the heat has been removed at some point but im not 100% sure at what point this is.  Thank you and keep up the good work.
Wow! I used to make cottage cheese using citric acid to form the curds. This is definitely a must try recipe! I've subscribed for more :)
Well crap....I wondered onto this video on accident. Now I must make cheese 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
Made with perfection, really admirable and I'll definitely gonna give it a try 😃
Yo this nigga made some good ass looking cheese
Thank you for sharing your experience....I am delighted...
Gaavin thank you Paul
I want translation to Arabic
Hi Gavin, I accidentally added WAY too much mesophilic culture to this recipe. Is the resulting cheese going to potentially be harmful to the consumer? Thanks!
Cheddar Cheese....Mmmmmmmm.......I miss it :(
So if I wanted to make a white cheddar, do I omit that annato stuff?  Also, why are you wasting all that whey?
What a waste of whey protein
We just eat it in couple of minutes, but process is bit longer, thanks for sharing
Thanks for the video! I have made my first cheese ready for aging. I expect my next one will be better, as I plan to use proper rennet and not the inferior junket variety.
can i eat it right away and not wait 3 months :)
دمت گرم
Verry good i hope to get that chesse with rennet right its done smart. Regards. J. Thiart
Thanks a lot man this video helped me get through some of my food tech gcse's
I imagine some people doing this and then realizing... *Oh man... Wtf am I going to do with all this cheese? Shit!*
Thanks very much for this lovely lesson ,very easy ,well done
الترجمة 😢
I stumbled upon your channel quite by accident. Let me say "WOW" You sir. You are the master of cheese! I'm in love with your channel and you have one more loyal subscriber. You are a artist with cheese! You are the master. I look forward to seeing every video you have done so far and every one to come. Thank you for your love of cheese!
Does this guy like cheese?
Excellent video.. Makes me want to make cheese. You make it look so easy. Experts have a way of doing that. Never as easy as an expert makes it look . You have inspired me . I will take up cheese making hobby for sure.  Thanks for the inspiration. I am looking forward to your other videos.
I followed your tute and kept one for 10 months......my friends loved it!! If I wanted to make a larger amount would i just multiply  ALL the ingredient measurements?
Thank you.
* sudden realization as to why it is called a cheesecloth*
I wonder if you had a second curd cutter, inserted them together and then rotated them in opposite directions would this not stop the curd from rotating.  On one of your cheeses which had a more solid curd I noticed the cutter couldn't get all the way around because the curd mass kept rotating.  You saved it with your knife skills though.
What is the alternative to rennet
When you let the curds sit in the pan how did you check that the temperature was 39 degrees?
Now I am craving cheese !  thanks for the video!  Yum looks delicious
is annatto just for color? if so is it optional? can you just make white cheddar or use(I wouldn't really, but) yellow food coloring?
What are different between homemade cheese and store cheese??
curd nerds lollll
Gavin your videos have made my weekend brother! I've now found the perfect thing to accompany my home brewing and home sausage making hobbies!  Let the haters hate! That's just more cheese, beer, and sausage for the rest of us.
beautifully done! looks really good...
What is the alternate of rennet?
excellent:)
So I can only find annatto seeds any suggestions on how to get in that liquid form you used?
wow good job mr gaven i love watching all your videos i dont mind at all how long they are that way i can learn better and not miss a thing very important to me keep up good work MR Gaven  cheese lover Tammy
and that s why british are not known for their cheese
In a world so dark and negative lately, Gavin's channel is seriously one of the most underrated, therapeutic, interesting thing I've ever stumbled across.. Now I watch his videos almost everyday/night. Way to go Gav, we love you! ❤
Can u mail me some homemade cheese....please ..I never had homemade cheese
You say that you're using a double boiler... Is there something we aren't seeing here? This looks like 1 normal (large) pot. A double boiler is one pot that fits inside another that has water in it - hence "double" and "boiler".
This is the most calming thing I've ever seen
first step is to move to cheddar, all other steps are void if the first step is not observed. The idea that any cow's milk cheese made in a vast number of ways are all cheddar cheese is just silly. If cheddar had been french or italian it would be a protected regional product but because it's english and there are a ridiculous number of 'cheese food' items that are called cheddar apparently anyone can call their vaguely cow milk based processed food slab of crap cheddar and that's fine. Note how another video refers to Parmesan style cheese rather than parmesan
Good job Sir, but we thought it simpler than this!
where can i find all those ingredients you mixed in water, can they be found at an everyday super market or do you have to buy them someplace specific/online
I started off today watching prison documentaries....now I'm learning to make cheese and made a price list of things I need to get...  I didn't know this would be so interesting, you make it look so easy.  absolutely subscribed to you.
I don't know why this was recommended to me but I enjoyed it
What an amazing video, I think I've found a new hobby. Thank you, Gavin.
I expect you get some nice active bacteria from under that ring.........!
At 2:03, do you kill the heat during ripening process?
Nice sir
What about a vídeo about raclette cheese? Woulld be great.
I guess I won't be making cheese I can't wait that long
Didn't hear it mentioned in the video and can't see a comment regarding the total weight of cheese this recipe produced?
Why are you not using latex gloves???? Why do you prefer coconut oil over lard? What color was the first Cheedar cheese? Otherwise, nice post. Suffering from a tropical storm, right now. Thanks!
Thanks for the video.Questions:Where is it stored?Temperature for storage?Have you done the math if it's cheaper to make your own or buy it? If so, what is the difference?
Live😍
رائع شكرا
woow amazing ..
This recipe is great!  I have used it four times in the last 3 weeks and each result has been magnificent! Curd nerds, listen up!  Watch your sterile technique.  Make sure your utensils and work area are spick and span.  Also, work patiently.  Once you add the bacteria to the milk you are working with living organisms.    Treat them with tender loving care by being gentle, patient and clean, clean, clean!
That looks amazing
ill just buy the cheese thanks for the vid tho
Hello Gavin, I hope you will bear with me.  I have been making cheese from your videos for about 6 months, so I am a total greenhorn when it comes to making cheese.  I hope this question does not seem to dumb.   I live in Thailand as you know, and it is almost impossible to get goats milk.   So........my question is:  Do you think it is possible to make cheese from the powdered goat milk formulas that many department stores sell here?   As always, thanks for all that you are doing to help us in the cheese world!
Even though I can't cook at all this is very interesting
NEVER translate to Imperial! The fuckers using Imperial never translate it for the smarter ppl using Metric!! (they probably can't)
عمل رائع.شكرا جزيلا على المجهودات و الشرح الواضح.
Meus parabéns, mesmo não entendo uma vírgula do que vc falou, só vendo deu pra perceber ó quanto vc é talentoso e q trabalho dá esse chegar!👍👍👏👏👏
I am a former Cheesehead. I have to learn how to do this to keep my Cheesehead card!
what exactly does cheddaring do? obviously it is necessary to get that flavour profile cheddar is known for, but how does it work?
I hope it is as exquisite as it is painful to prepare.😀
Your channel is making me so happy! What is your favourite cheese you've made so far?
In this Life, im NEVER gonna have nerves to prepare this.
G'day curd nerds 😂😂😂😂😂
HOW TO MAKE ACTUAL CHEZ! GET A COWS UTTER GET A BUCKET SQUEEZE MELK INTO BUKETT MMM YUMMEH PUT YO HENDS IN BUKETT AND RUB UNTEL MELK HARD EAT MELK HARD
mmmmmm
Why is the milk not allowed to be moving when you put the lid on?
Nice .but ..its really hard😅
that cheese came out sexy
Thank you, Gavin.  I am making cheddar right now in coastal Virginia, USA with 3 gallons of raw milk from the neighbor (my weekly allotment).  All of your recipes have been great so far -- I've tried Gruyere, cheddar, Butterkase, and Havarti.    I just received Penicillium Roquefort and am making petit bleu tomorrow morning.  Cheesemaking is a great hobby!
I just got really interested in cheese making all of a sudden, and you opened the video by calling us "Curd Nerds" and now I'm smiling. Happy to be a curd nerd :)
Wow there is lots of process and patience involved in this
Can I ask where the heck you keep the cheese for the three months, to keep it at such a constant temperature?  I reckon I've got everything else, except that!
i thoroughly enjoyed this
So beautiful cheese ❤❤❤🧀
Seems like a lot of work. Was the original Chedder made using Annato?
Resp. Dude! Nice 2 wach you. Greets from Germany.
CURDS HAVE BEEN DAMAGED THEY NEED TO REGEN (HEAL) AND THEN WE WILL BE BA CK IN BUISSNESS I cant be bothered to put back normally
I've been taught that Calcium Chloride is toxic? Can you omit calcium chloride?
It is 2 am and I am watching a guy making cheddar cheese..
Ganz klar ein super nice Video ich komme aus DEUTSCHLAND bitte mach weiter so du geile Sau
wow if you can do this for an industrial amount, seems like a great business opportunity.
all of this, all of my 4 days wasted, just to make cheese for grilling burgers... gotta love life
Mr. Webber, could you please clarify what you mean by full cream milk? I'm sure our terminology in the U.S. is a bit different. Would it be the same thing as what we call "whole milk" which has been pasteurized and can be purchased in grocery stores, or would it be pure raw organic milk which has not had the cream removed? Thank you!
Damn. I was hoping you were selling some of the cheese you made
And almost a plastic.. Thats why Minas Gerais are winning all prizes in making REALLY CHEESE,,  How long to the food became a UNATURAL thinf..full of chemicals things...
So, after a few days of air drying, you could have coated it with wax, and let it age? No refrigeration needed? I'm not sure. This was fascinating, thank you. Must use cows milk though. I don't have a cow.
I use this video for sleep therapy
KUT...
Gavin - Great video.  Used this recipe yesterday (which differed slightly from the Traditional Cheddar recipe in Ricki Carrol's book) and it turned out beautifully.  Not my first go around in making cheeses, and defiantly a winner.  Looking forward to trying the Double Gloucester recipe you have as well.  Thanks again and keep up the great work.
What is full cream milk?? Heavy cream or plain whole milk??
nice work....thanks for sharring
thanks for sharing us your helpfull experience
please, I live in Egypt.. it is hot over there >> how can I keep this low temperature at home  while I store the cheese?
try to bake bread with this whey >> amazing and so healthy
Hi dear Gavin,tell me to make an chese i need to have scream milk % of gras inside  2.8 or more? Thank you
Thank you for making this simple and easy vedio, I really enjoyed watching it. It will be my first time to make cheddar cheese .I have a raw milk should I use all the ingredients you mentioned?
You make such nice and interesting videos. Where do you get all the ingredients though?
you helped me to get sleep
What does the calcium chloride do? Is it a preservative?
This is absolutely fascinating stuff. Once I get a double boiler and press I'll give this a go in the Fall. Thanks.
Thank you for posting this, I am slowly moving up the cheese chain and getting to the harder cheeses, North Bend, PA
I didn't intentionally end up here either but it is mesmerizing and a soothing voice with an Australian accent. Wondering how I could do it here in Bali at the moment. Good on you Gavin
I didn't intentionally end up here, but I'm here now and have found myself oddly entranced. I'd like to say that I'm a moderate fan of cheese, but with the added narration of such a soothing voice, I find myself enjoying this entire YouTube channel. You have yourself a new subscriber, mate.
Is it possible to add bacon to an aged cheddar (like they have at some supermarkets) without causing any problems?
Hi Gavin, I'm interested in buying the Riki Carroll book from your store - I've just found out about the importance of ph levels. Does this book have info about ph levels? Thanks 😀
Gavin, I followed your Cheddar recipe (except used wax) and left the cheese out in my shop over the Winter and finally cut it earlier this week.  We were shocked at how amazing it turned out. It did need a day or two in the refrigerator to firm up and it's the best Cheddar I've ever had.  Thank you for your recipe and tireless effort to educate us folks.
Is it funny how I'm eating cheese while watching this
What if I want white cheddar?
Hey friend, thanks for the recipe, but let me to tell you when you were filtering curd, you wasted the protein rich water by sending it to sink. Instead, filter the curd inside a saucepan. And get the water, with this water you can get what we call here in Turkey as "Lor" or as Italians called 'Ricotta'...  Put that water on heat and when it boils, add 100 mg white winegar (for this amount of water)  (Apple or grape) you will see it produces curd again. Filter it with a cloth, knot the cloth and hang it for 24 hours. So you can get rid of the water inside the "lor"... 24 hours after you will have very tasty, protein rich, low fat cheese. We usually consume it during breakfasts with honey or jam. Or like italians you can use it with pastas...  After having lor, my advise don't waste the water. It has still protein inside, u can use it with your all bakeries of course pay attention to the vinegar inside. ITs not suitable for bakeries which you use yiest, but if you cook sth with baking soda, its very very good.
it's 5am why am i watching this.   i don't even like cheese
https://youtu.be/jvLsnYhSM6U  Jet black charcoal cheese
How profitable is this method? or only worth for personal usage?
just wanted you to know, i tried to contact you on live video. apparently i do not have that feature. i do not have equipment to make cheese, but i watch your videos often, thanks to my friend who recommended me to you. love your videos  and love cheese. i have tried cheese made from my friend, it was incredible.  no comparison t store bought. thank you so much.
Hi dear,how many kg of cheese you get from 10 lt of milk?  Thank you
Hi Gavin, what humidity did you age this at? Thanks 😀
how the fuck is your stove so clean?
I appreciate this video, but could you show us or tell how low is that burner? thanks
salut
awesome 😍👌 I just hope to find these ingredient s in my area.Have you done Camembert cheese ?
What kind of heat source do you use?
I thought my parents had sex... This is how I was made???
lemme just get my Mesophilic culture, Calcium Chloride, Liquid Rennet, and my Annatto  out of the pantry
after 10 minutes of watching i still can't understand why am i watching this
its been 3 months since I made this cheese, come the taste test it is a little bland in taste and a little hard, i may of pressed it with to much pressure, I think that will account for it being hard, but why do you think it is a bit bland in taste, I have only cut 1/2 of it off and re waxed it and leaving for another 3 months, will that improve the taste?..... but for first attempt, with your help, very happy
!
Beautiful :) , how much the price mate?
do u ship to Singapore? thank you
Hi Gavin, a vital issue for me. In very first stage, after adding the culture and rennet when we are resting the milk for 40minutes periods still we are maintaning the 31C, right?
He is the Bob Ross of Cheese.
i dont even like cheddar
I found this extremely relaxing.
Amazing video 😊 thank you 🌹
Hi Gavin, Love your videos - but not actually made my own yet. What would the cost of making this cheddar be? Does it work out as economical vs buying store bought?
Nice
nice
Yum!
Will take 6 months to make, but will only take 1 week or less to finish...
ماذا يحدث بعد ان منعت الأكسجين عنها ؟!!!!
at 10:00 what is the temperature of the curd? (milling/salting)
Very informative video. Is there a maximum  time to leave it?
I looooooooooooooove cheese bad ass video man
The Cheddering Process. The Third Chedder. Sounds like a sci-fi movie. But in yourvoice it just makes me laugh for some reason! As a foodie, I loved this... I am totally going to do this!!!! My boys saw it and want to start a family project!
When he gets that milk up to 88, you're gonna see some serious shit
Thank you for the great videos. I almost watched it 10 times.  And i making the cheese according to your advise.   Today i am making my 4th cheese. 1st was 2017/5/6, 2nd was 2017/5/7, 3rd was 2017/5/9 and today is 4th.   Really looking forward to taste it. It will be one week later. When the tasting will be tell you the results.
What sort of cheese would you recommend for someone making cheese for the first time?
Instructions unclear    got dick caught in a grater
The process is too complicated.
i used to love eting cheddar rind when I was little! never see it now with all the processed stuff!
interesting video!  not sure how I came across this on YT but definitely cool :). are the curds safe to eat?  do they taste like cheddar?  like how it would in the store?
When you smoke this it has an amazing taste :D great video
I just discovered your channel, amazing. Question if I were to make a smoked cheddar at what point in the process would I choose to smoke it. Sorry if this seems like a dumb question I have never made a cheese before, nor would I start with this one but for a future reference and whoever else out there wants to know. Thanks so much. Love the channel. Keep up the awesome work!
using Rennet no thanks this is fucking awful, baby cow murderers, hmmmm taste that dead baby cow stomach enzyme, tastes delicious!!!!! sick fucktards!!!!!!!!
long.process.for.making cheese. I think I am not patient enough to make it. I will just buy my cheese but thank you for how to make it. very informative.
that is totally amazing, seems like a long process but possible to make at home. thank you kind sir.
woow
Dam, that's a lot of work for cheese, I bet it's worth though!
Man you need to make your videos clearer so that people who have never made cheese actually understand what it is you are doing. Instead you are making this very complicated.
what does a guy need for cheese making tools where do you get that stuff rennat?
I really enjoy your videos, I have been wanting to get into cheese making at home for quite a while. can two rolls of cheese be done at a time or is that not a good idea? I see it is a time consuming process and my family eats alot of cheese everyday so making two rolls at a over the course of several days would may be keep us in cheese lol. Thanks for the video, very informative.
a great hobby you have
Curd nerds?
Hm, not all my curds have fallen after the appropriate time, I see a good few of them on top still. Disregard them and carry on?
Nope, not for me.  But thanks anyway.
wow it is so complicated
Ohhh my will you make me one for my birthday ? Lol just kidding. 😁 Thank you for sharing that.
IT'S 2AM! WHY AM I WATCHING THIS?
does It need pasteurized milk?
*0.41*  Traditionally its *LARD!?!* Lard the pig stuff..!?!
how do you tell, with that cheese press how much weight you have pressed onto the cheese?
How did I get here?
how do you make fromunda cheese?
Awesome!
Can I follow the same recipe for raw milk? Or do I have to change things and leave things out, like the CalCh.
you made it look easy i think i will try it, wish me luck
weri good
when the curds come out it looks like a giant Crack Cake
I have never before made cheese, and I am not a huge fan of it's taste either. But, I've been sick all day and now I find myself watching how to make!😂😂😂 I have never thought about how it's made, and I must say it's an interesting process and I enjoyed watching this vid.
Best thing about this video is his accent😂😂😂😂😂😂
what temperature would you recommend aging this at?
A cheese lover here from Hong Kong loves watching your videos ! It's amazing ! Keep it up !!
he use cow milk right?
Do you think butter would be a good substitute for the lard/coconut oil?
You had me at "goodeye curd nerds"
Very impressive. I've never even thought about how to make cheese before. Usually I'm game for anything, but I won't be trying to make cheese myself anytime soon. Where the world are you going to get 3 or 6 months of a 50° temperature? I knew rennet was part of cheesemaking, but the other two things? Never heard of them.  Interesting video. Thanks for posting it.
where do you find annatto?
My tummy feels weird. I'm taiwanese and can barely process cheese, milk makes me violently miserably ill. Its so weird looking at it turn into goo. That's quite... unique
can  you block that kid? Plz clean up comment area.Love from sweden.
waw amazing
I'm interested in starting to make cheese but obviously, don't have any used cloth. Is there a reason for not using new cloth and how would I go about making the cloth used without ruining anything?
hmmm, spend 5 days making cheddar cheese and then 6 months hanging around waiting, or walk a block and buy gourmet cheddar from the meat shop?
what is the approximate milk volume to final cheese product ratio? how much milk for how much cheese?  could you throw some light on that so I know how much milk (and type, fat %) I need to get?  from India
How do you eat that with kangkaroo?
Bb
So you cannot produce cheese without rennet?
amaizing..
cheaper to buy Cheddar Cheese innit
The process is really beautiful, greetings from Brazil!
Thx for this video ! I'm french and i love cheese ! i'll do the same at home. Greeting for paris
Awesome channel. Greetings from Argentina.
do you find cloth works better then waxing the cheese ? i know nothing about cheese making just started watching your videos and was very curious.
ok Gavin this is my third wheel of cheese, all your recipes,the cheddar is in the press right this minute ,I'm trying a different technique on the cheese cloth wrapping it's a salt brine and changing out cheese cloth frequently,I saw this on "Tales of the Green valley" BBC someone posted on YouTube.Thank you love your channel,I will have to let you know how it turns out.
How was flavor?  I also wanted to ask if I can add some kind of fungus or if you can mix with some kind of goat cheese to give it some added flavor?
GOOD JOB!!!
I am in America, when you say full cream milk would whole milk (which is 3.5-4% milk fat) be the same thing? or would I need  half&half or heavy cream added to the whole milk?
phew, thank god im watching this vid just now and not few months ago.
Cheese Brain? 6:13 min xD
Oh noo, you shouldn't have throwm out the yellow stuff (don't know the English name) since that is amazing for baking breads!
Do you have the heat on during the cheddaring process?
Hi, I am getting all the ingredient for this cheddar, I am a bit confused by the amount of different types of mesophilic culture, is there a specific type ?  ps I only live 2 miles from Cheddar and you are right, its in Somerset, They have a Cheddar Cheese factory you can visit and watch them making it  Great informative and easy to follow videos , thanks
Hi, I'm from Mexico and I don't really know what do you mean with "mesophilic culture". Can you explain it to me? Thanks!
how do you know what is the pound pressure your press give to you? I mean, you don't have any indicator :\
You are a quality content producer. Keep it up!
Blessed are the cheese makers.
next week i planning to perform your recipe and i would like to use raw milk and will pasteurise it myself. Do you advise it? besides i have no chance to find the Annatto in my country do you have any alternative to that?
Hi Gavin! Again, Thanks for all the great videos you post. I have a question. Can you substitute the rennet tablets for the liquid rennet in your recipes? The reason I ask, I had some old liquid rennet and it would not coagulate the milk, and I ended up wasting 2 gallons of milk. What are your thoughts?
When I mature the cheddar after using the red cheese wax does it need to be left in a room temperature or can it mature in fridge?
where would you get all the calcium chloride and rennet etc?
noticed you poured the whey down the drain, I was wondering isn't there a way this whey can be repurposed at home?
Mr. Webber, I have been making cheese for less than a month, but I have found my new favorite thing to do! Thanks to your videos, I'm pleased with the way the cheeses are turning out. I have a request, if you're up for a challenge. I lived in Venezuela as a child, and the reason I started making cheese was because I wanted to figure out how to make Venezuelan Queso de Mano. unfortunately, I haven't been able to find a reliable resource.  Might you be able to do a video on Venezuelan Queso de Mano? I would be very interested!
Hey Gavin. I loved your vídeos. Thank so much for share your experience. I will try make the cheddar, because here in Brazil is so dificult to find it. I have a question: After three months you change the cloth banded to vacuum. This is necessary, or can I mantain the cloth banded? Thanks.
And I'm just buying a block of this in the supermarket and eating it in half an hour..
how did people discover how to make food like this???
loved the video, going to try it, but what size is the cheese basket, you say 165mm but what are the other dimensions, thanks
Hi  Thanks for sharing all your hard work and knowledge with us. I have a question for you and I don’t think you cover it on your Q&A videos. I will start to make cheese and I wish to know what is the deference between the wax and the sous-vide for aging cheese I saw you unwrap your cheddar and it seem to mature in the plastic. Did the sous-vide make aging slower? Did the cheese cave humidity still realy important with plastic wrap? I have a sous vide  machine and I think it’s easier to use then the wax. Thanks for your help I wish you a great day!   Your little padawan/curd nerd
Really mesmerized by your cheese-making. You say heat the mixture back up to 39 degrees over a 40 minute period - how is this achieved - on a low gas marking?
I was watching peacefully and then I saw 3 months...
i love this guy's accent
amazing, thanks for sharing!
Thank you for sharing the process with us! We had sharp cheddar with our lunch today, and my five-year-old daughter asked how cheese was made. :) This was a fun way to answer her question.
When you "air dry" do you leave at room temp or put it in the cheese fridge?
such a small batch, this thing will disappear in 2 days.
This is the cheesiest video I've ever seen. And I mean that in a good way!
HA !!  'Waxing the Cheddar' lol i do that daily ! haha
We sit and do tricks for cheese 🧀:)
That was a really nicely done video. I enjoyed it. Something I would like to do with my companion when retired.
looks bloody great mate,, ive got to try this,, can i add chilles powder to it at some stage.
My favorite cheese is cheddar
Please receive my regards from Mexico. This is a great video and your fine explanation did not leave any doubt about the proceeding. Excellent work.
In your one-month update, you describe the temperature of the cheese cave as 13 degrees Celsius.  Here it is 10 degrees.  Is one of these a mistake or is there a point when the temperature of the cave needs to be increased, and if so, when?
Is the coloring agent necessary? I wont bother if all it does is provide artificial color.
good
Hi Gavin. Can I brine cheddar cheese? Does it change the texture or taste?
i get drunk and watch cheese videos.i dont know which one im more concerned about...
What type of cheese would this taste like if you didnt age it?
Hi Gavin, would you add any seasonings at the milling stage? Such as liquid smoke, dried peppers, herbs etc? Also at what stage would you add lipase if you were making a sharp cheese? Thank you
This guy is the Bob Ross of cheese
Could you eat this at any stage? Say like the cheddaring stage?
I'd really like to learn how to make a wicked Lancre blue and name it Horace.
I wonder how cheese was first discovered, because, from what I understand,  its ''basically'' spoiled milk, but done in a controlled way. I can probably look it up. Think I will.
gross
Dang, who knew a simple-looking everyday food would turn out hard and a very long time!!! :/
Have you ever tried to make an old fashioned cheese without the additives? Just milk and whatever else you need. If not, I think it'd be an interesting experiment.
you really like cheese
I have just started this recipe I used Great British Milk with 0.1 fat to have a zero fat version so far small things have binded but not a lot yet do I need to wait longer?
wow, this is a long processus to making this cheddar... but really cool. thank you to share around the world.
I would love to make a high quality cheese press. Any link to any plans or video?
I'm curious...if you handle the cheese with your bare hands before covering it and storing it, is there not a danger that you will contaminate it and cause undesirable mould/bacterial growth on the inside of the cheese? Would it not be better to wear protective gloves for these steps?
I've managed to get some straight-from-a-cow milk.  Does this mean that the calcium chloride should not be added or merely that it is not an essential ingredient?
Does it stink making the cheese? At any of the steps? Silly question but i really am curious
Question, once I got to 88 degrees I turned off the heat but it continued to rise all the way to 95F. Will this still work OK or should I have taken it out of the double boiler?
seriously six months to see the results
good sir ...tq
thanks for the nice video. I live in tropical country. When drying the cheese, how much air temperature and humidity should it be?
i love you
here i am after 6 months ... where is my cheddar?!
good day Gavin Webber can I replace the mesophilic if it's not available around and also the annatto please advise
this shit helped me calm down after doing a bunch of blow 😂😂😂😂
u just made cheese by using cheese
I thought you said you were going to wax the cheese or did I misunderstand?
Have you cut the cheese yet, as I write this it's been 6 months and 6 days (01-30-2017). I don't think I could wait that long, lol
you so calm man..soothing music in the background helps relax too.. awesome content
The curds look like tofu
I just woke up and watched this and I already want to go back to bed, your voice is so calming.
I feel I could watch you durring a bad trip, and calm down very easily.
you sound like the guy who commentates the Aussie Millions haha.
nice job friend
This is a real art, I guess I will just keep buying cheese from Safeway .
greaa day! this a whole lot of work for some cheese man..!
You're a cool guy
Hi. What is the difference between whole milk and full cream milk? How can I replace it? Regards!
could you please tell me could you use cheese wax instead of coconut oil or lard also what is the best lard sheep beef or pork
yummy. must be really satisfying eating a home made goody.
tank you so much ...
Awesome video and great effort!  As an european i liked how you explained everythin in cm and inch
Hi Gavin.  I'm just getting ready to try my hand at making cheese.  Tell me, when you bring it up to 88F and add the culture, you say to let it ripen for 40 min.  Is the heat still on during that period? How about after you add the rennet?
So, when are you going to make some Casu marzu ? :-)
Excuse my ignorance - but at 4:50 or so, when you cut the curds - are they edible at that point, like at that point would they be packaged up for sale if you were selling cheese curds, or is there a different process for those?
what kind of sorcery is this? jajaja it's is like looking at alchemy, amazing man.
"CURD NERDS!"
Gavin, when is the taste test, should be about this time
That seems like a lot of work! However, it has to be satisfying to eat and share with friends and family. Thank you for the vid!
beautiful cheese
to me, that shoud be orange
it's almost time to taste the cheese
Can I use muslin instead of cheese cloth 😊
Wow
Great tutorial.  If you want to process the cheese further, here the real Swiss fondue recipe:  www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK_4toTmhI4
How is Longhorn Style Cheddar cheese maded? What is the difference with standard cheddar?
How did you accurately determine the pressure used in the press?
I recently tasted a coconut cheddar and wondered how to make it. The label said it was made with raw cows milk and coconut cream. Can you tell me at what stage would the coconut milk be added, would the aging time change, and would the type and/or amount of cultures be different than from the recipe on this cheddar video?
can I use butter instead of coconut oil?
Very nice.  What's the longest matured cheese you have made?
Thank you
Does it matter how long you age it and if so how long are you suppose to age it
Hey mate, i was just wondering does it matter how small or big you cut the curd into or can i just go in with a knife and slice. Cheers mates
Hi, Gavin; I know this is not the right place to ask the question about any cheese. But I have to ask a question. When a Gouda or any cheese got mold outside, can we use it after removing mold?  By the way; I have a lot of questions and if you can guide me. It is needless to say that i am also cheese lover. (:
Oh and another question - I have seen that here in Europe, the liquid wax is more generally used, can I just use a couple of layers of this, or should I try and purchase cheese wax instead? Thanks again.
Hi Gavin, I want to thank you for your great videos, they are very instructive and informative and are perfect for novices like myself. I really want to try your cheddar recipe, but only have a pot that can hold max. 4 litres of milk. Can I simply reduce your recipe to suit my amount or is there something I should be aware of by doing this? Thanks for your help. I look forward to new tutorials. Regards.
I've made this cheddar (without the cloth) a few times  and have some tips that make a difference.  1. When buying milk, I try mix it up by getting different brands or "use by" dates. 2.  I put the Calcium Chloride in at the start, while warming the milk and then add the Meso. culture when it gets to temp. This definitely improves the yield. 3. Gavin, your suggestion to vacuum wrap some cheeses is a winner! much easier (not to mention less messy) than waxing. Definitely worthwhile getting a vacuum wrapper. Thank you for an awesome channel. My next cheeses are going to be Buterkäse and Tilsit. Nom nom nom.
If you were to wax this cheese, are there any other steps required, or is it just a matter of replacing the coconut oil/lard and cloth step with the waxing process?
hey Gavin what is the difference between waxing and clothing???
what does it taste like if you eat the cheese early?
Oh! no way. That looks delicious!!!! what kind of milk did you use for that?
Can you please tell me  the weight of final yield?
Gavin I have a question, how important is the humidity when you cover the cheddar cheese in wax? does it permiate through the wax at all?
What an informative and educational video, thanks. don't think that i have the patience to do what you do, however i can imagine that its not about this, but the satisfaction in making your own. I've made basic cheese before (milk, lemon juice) but will stick to making my own vodka for now :D
this was awesome...
hello thanks so much for this video i have great ideas to do i can't wait until the vacation comes well right now i'm in collage
Hi Gavin What size hard cheese mould did you use for this recipe? Also how much cheese does it yield? Thanks
Thanks for answering everyone's queries, Gavin.  I have one more before I try this over the Christmas break.  I can get hold of milk that has been pasteurised at 74 C (165.2 F), but I cannot find anything done at a lower temperature, let alone raw milk.  Is there any adjustment I need to make to the recipe to accommodate this?
"But wait there's more! after 3 months u need to wait 1 more year before you can eat the cheddar cheese." 😂😂😂
You wanna make sure ye have a niiiiioiice sharrrp cheddda bfor goin out into the bush lioke this
Wont the coconut oil go off?
I subed send me. a piece please😇
YOU FREAKING LEGEND
I have a recently purchased cheese-making set with rennet extracted from Rhizomucor miehei.  Is there anything I should do differently when making cheddar with this type of rennet, or should I in fact get a different rennet to start with?
Watching this while munching on some cheese. #ilovecheese
Does it require any specific humidity setting?
Yummy !
how do I smoke this cheese. I love smoked cheddar
What version of 'cup' are you using: metric or imperial?  How many millilitres is it?
Great video. I'm trying to learn more about cheese. Very cool stuff. Quick question how hungry/crazy was the first person who tried cheese after transporting milk in a goats stomach?
this video is incredibly relaxing.
Can the Annatto be optional?
that whey you threw away.... you can also use it in soups instead of water; and you can use it in sodabread instead of buttermilk and you can give it to your cat as it's lactose free  gonna go search for your ricotta vid though, I didn't know you could use whey to make that  good stuff
Great video, thank you for this good job!
Hi,  I saw on other recipes for cheese they say to put a clean cheese cloth when you turn it over.  Do you ever do that or is the same one just fine to keep using?
u should have cut it open :(
Gracias por compartir tus conocimientos, saludos desde Perú!!!
Fantastic!
This is sort of... therapeutic :)
Can we wax all types of cheeses for aging?
I put cheese on my cheese.
6:13 looks like a brain
ooooh Hell yes I like Cheddar ty for posting Gavin.
So we have that cold cellar in the building where we live, but the temperature is about 5...7C degrees. Is it even worth trying to mature cheddar there? If not, for what cheese that temperature would be suitable?
boring
Where can i pick a machine like that?
its 3 am on a sunday night, and im watching a 15 minute video on how to make cheddar cheese... what am i doing
I've always been a great fan of mesophilic culture.
have you thought of putting a few grooves into the bass of the cheese press to help the whey run out from underneath? i like the home build though. never by wat you can make. thanks rolfo
good work mate ... I love chadder cheese
Wow, no wonder Cheese so expensive, so much work goes into making
Awesome job bro. Love sharp cheddar. As soon as I'm well from cancer treatment I will try it out. One question...is it better to use unpasteurized milk
Where did you get the milk to work with. I tried to stop the video to see, but you moved too fast...lol. Thanks so much for sharing this
"On with the chüuicce"
I dont know how it works with cheddar. but this yellow water (i dont know what is called in english) is good for. sportsmen use it.
why dont you use gloves? it doesn't seem very hygienic to be touching the cheese all the time with your hands
That's one tasty lookin' cheese
Hi Gavin, How do you control your press pressure? I was wondering that you know exactly when it is 15kg or 22kg with no measure visible on videos at least.  Thanks and greetings from Poland :-)
I tried this method, but used a sous vide supreme. The cheese was pressed, and has been drying 3 days now. Is it normal for what looks like white mold to grow on the outside before the banding?
Magical! I loved watching this. I want to try this. Where do I get all of the ingredients from?
who the hell came up with the idea of doing that to milk?
Thank you for the time and effort you put into all your videos, the learning curve is much shorter due to your efforts.
First person to make cheese: "You know what this warm milk needs? Mesophiles, and a complex of enzymes produced in the stomachs of ruminant mammals."
How the hell do people figure these recipes out?
2:11 forty minutes lighter? what?
Such a great video and I like how you walk us through it. Easy to follow. Thanks for making this.
This is soo interesting! I love it!
You are the bob ross of cheese.
impressive!
Jesus, after all these I think I'll keep on buying storebought cheese!
ive wasted so much money on cheddar.better do this myself from now on!
thank you. best wishes from switzerland.
+Gavin Webber  If I wanted to smoke the cheese, would it be best to do it before pressing (very strong smoked flavor, I assume), before aging, or after aging (unlikely, I'd guess)?
Exelente! Simple and tasty.
ugh i forgot you couldnt eat it for a while after making it.
I'm watching somebody make cheddar cheese... I love the internet.
This is beyond amazing, thank you so much for this video. Sadly I don't have the tools or the ingredients or the patience do recreate this.
Could you make a video about all the equipment you need to make cheese? I would highly appreciate it!
WTF i'm i watching at 3am? I have no fucking life
please can you traslete in arabic please
How can you tell how much pressure you're pressing with? I don't see a gauge.
Looks great
Thanks for the video! Great job.
I started off watching The Legend Of Zelda Orchestra and somehow ended up here
Okay...so you make it look WAY easier than it is. Mine didn't work out so well. Curds didn't form well but I will try again soon and hopefully practice will make perfect one day!   Though it didn't turn out I'm loving the challenge and the process.   Thanks for your videos...I'm totally addicted!
I randomly came across this but I really wanna wait 4 more months for this cheese
Hi Gavin,   I am attempting this tomorrow! Yikes! I'm nervous...   My question is...I can only find homogenized milk. Can I use this with citric acid or does it have to be non homogenized?   Thanks!
Got to get it up to 88 degrees :)
I save the whey to drink it later.
Can u make vegan cheese? I request this!
Nice video
Is there a reason that you can't just vacuum seal and age?
Really Interesting. :)
can I have a cheese wheel?
I have one question, where would be the best place to have steady 10c over 9months? I really, really want to make my own cheddar as i adore the cheese.. but im not sure where i live place like that can be found apart from some extra fridge for cheese only (which i dont have money for frankly)
Very cool video. First time I've ever seen cheese made. Always wondered how it was made in the back of my head.
My thoughts from watching this channel:  1) Oh, so that's how they make that kind of cheese  and 2) How in the hell did people figure out this would make food
The good thing about Cheddar "cheese" is that you need to add only one more ingredient and it's plastic.
How the hell did i ended up here
Technically speaking, if it wasn't made in the Cheddar Gorge, then it is a 'Cheddar style' cheese and not Cheddar. Not sure if the 'Nom de appellation' is still in place with Brexit and all that cheesy stuff.
Hey Gavin, I found a liquid rennet in an eshop but they are recommending 1ml for 10-15 liters of milk. Do I still follow your recipe or do I follow their recommended dosage? Also, it is made out of vegetables, not from cows stomachs, it that something to be concerned about?  Also, if I halve the ingredients what kind of container to press it in would you recommend from your website? I'd prefer if it had the same proportions of height and width as yours has :)  Thanks
Cheddar Cheese the good flavor.
ITS PERFECT
is this a new video I just looked up cheddar cheese and poof it popped up
I clicked through the fury of random videos and found these. My lord this is actually amazing! you are like the Bob Ross of Cheese my friend. Cheers from Canada🇨🇦
Where does the orange color come from?
Is there a good site for how to make this on a smaller scale? or does it not turn out right?
This is the 4th video of yours I have watched and there is just something special about what your doing. Keep up the good work! New Subscriber here!
I want you to know you have a voice like Bob Ross.
What's happening? How did i get here? This is awesome!
I have no idea how i got here, but i'm def gonna be making cheese at some point in the next few weeks
Came across your video while I was chilling in a bath and almost drowned I swear to god lol. Suddenly jerked awake and realised I had actually drifted off in the bath. And now I am addicted to your videos because they're soooo relaxing! I will probably never make cheese in my life and I still love these videos so you're definitely reaching more people than just cheese makers! Good job mate!  -from a fellow Aussie.
Too difficult to make it.a lot of patients need(
Awesome job and video
its only September :(
watching this while chewing cheddar
HOW DID I GET HERE!?
1/8 th teaspoon culture = how many grams?
awwooo wow 👍👍👍👍
I don't like cheese, what am I doing here
start my 3 page essay thats due tomorrow or watch  a video on how to make cheddar cheese? cheese > essay
I'm watching this so I can make it jus in case shit goes down
Erm
What is the final weight of the wheel when you're done? 2+kg?
Does the lactose source change the recipe? I.E. Goats milk or sheep milk?
Wow that looks good!  Where do you store it at 50 F?  A refrigerator is too cold?
Cheddar is smothered in lard?! I knew it wasn't vegetarian but goodness, yuck. Coconut oil sounds much better.
woooooooooooooooooow. amazing.
Nice video lot of work......labor of love. What is the final weight of your cheese?
This was a very interesting 15 minutes. Who else can't wait for January?!
How much does this cost to make? How much does it cost to make if you're trying all the tools you need for the first time? How about in relation to store bought cheese?  This is so interesting and I'd love to make cheese on my own!
I was thinking it was literally going to become cheese after the first set of ingredients.
Where do you get all these ingredients from?
wow
this video was more relaxing than a fistful of valium
Thanks! This helped alot :)
Is whey reusable in any way, like buttermilk from when you've made butter?
Would this be the same process I would do to make cheese curds for poutine? Minus the press?
wow....        I like it
very enjoyable;I learned something
hello .. do you use full cream milk or partially skimmed milk.?btw nice and helpful video .
Awesome video! Thanks a lot
Love your video!  why this taste much better than supermarket cheddar? is there any difference in processing? thank you
6 months really none of my relationships even if that long
Very cool, man!
sadly in my country i cant find the culture nor the cheesecloth (well, that was a dissapointment..) buy anyway i didnt had a way to keep the cheese at 10C fpr 6 months  btw loved the video!
I am lactose intolerant and looking at this gave me diarrhea
Is that kefir behind??
a very chemical engineering approach. i like it!!
soo I've never made cheese before but from brewing beer, i woild imagine this is a smelly process? is this possible in a one bedroom apartment 😂
Is the cheese ready for test
thankyou for your video! just beginning my cheese making journey! i soaked some safron in water for a day and it made a nice colouring for the cheese but would it matter much if i substituted citric acid instead? thanks for your expertese!
soooo much work. Government cheese should be ashamed!
about how much does a wheel that size weigh?
Love the video. I am going to try and make this.
Hi mister Webber. Is annato mixed with water or oil? where I live I can Find the seeds, but I can see that you are using a liquid.
I love you videos Mr. Webber...you inspire me to make my favorite food in all the world! Blessings!
Why am I watching this? How did I end up here?
Excellent video - thanks! How much cheese do you yield from the initial 10L milk?
omfg that cheddar is one big chemical reaction
How much for ingredients used. I spend about $40 a month on cheese wonder if this is a cheaper option.
Great video :)
how important is disinfection? do you just wash hands or do you keep all the tools sterile? can the cheese mould?
is it possible to make a sheep cheddar?
I don't even know all those ingredients, the one I know is full cream milk xD
I still won't make it because its too time consuming but this is still interesting.
i'm gonna try making this since they don't sell cheddar in norway
i dont even like cheese but the quality of the vid is soo good that i just had to drop a like
I was about to say u know I could go to the store and buy cheeze  but after watching this i respect your ability to make cheese to perfection.
Jesus! Cheese making is not for the wimps. Amazing video!
Hi Gavin sorry I didn't get back sooner, had a fall and broke my foot! I found my mozzarella had a slight bitter after taste along with my Camembert and my Farmhouse cheddar, I used Mad Millie cultures, veg rennet and unhomoginised milk when I first started in order to become familiar with the whole process. For the Swiss cheese I used TA61  thermophilic plus Proprioni bacteria, veg rennet and unhomoginised milk. I'm waiting on a Parmesan that should be ready to try in October..?🤔 The only one I've enjoyed eating that I've made is goats cheese.  Love the process of making the cheese, it's exciting but the bitter aftertaste has turned me off, it's not extreme by far but I've stopped trying to make cheese because of it. My friends and family have liked them but agree they're slightly bitter. Enjoy watching  you make yours instead!
this is so relaxing. voice and movements etc. yet entertaining. very well done
sir, I'm such a cheese freek. and have always wanted to make cheese at home. I was introduced to your channel yesterday, and I think I may have found my new best friend! I'm so excited. I'm looking forward to watching all of the past videos, and new videos as well.  now I have to build a cheese room and cheese cave. Can Parmesean cheese be made in the US even close to Parmesean Regianno?
Loved the video, Subbed!  I was wondering how you maintain the temp. during aging?
Hi Gavin!   You ended up on reddit!  https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtisanVideos/comments/4yoxai/gavin_webber_makes_cheddar_cheese/
This is a goal of mine when I get a few Dexter cattle, thanks!
Lovely video, well done and relaxing. I needed that, thanks!
thanks again for your answer looking forward for the tasting video
This was quite a thing to watch. Thank you.
Are you really going to wait six months to taste it? I would not dried as long
nice work it looks delicious , i have a question out of curiosity this not the kind of chedder u would use for burgers right ?
how long does that cheese last? i mean, when does it expired?
Amazing!
What a wonderful video.  I just located a farm that I can purchase raw milk. I am going to give this a try.  Thank you for making such a great video.
It's midnight why the fuck am I watching this.
wish i knew about this channel earlier. :S lovely video! mind if i ask is there a way to make hardish cheese without any chemicals such as calcium chloride? (i have no idea where to get that in my country.)
What is is about cheese that causes an aging process rather than decomposition?
awesome video thx I love cheese haha
Excellent channel you have here Mr. Webber!  I've just subscribed.
hello all great, thank you for your explanation I have two questions or you put your cheese to the finished exque and I am obliged to culture for raw milk thank you
you have such a comforting voice could listen to you for hours
Why does my finished cheese always have a slightly bitter taste please Gavin? I'm in Victoria and buy my milk from Woollies?
I was in Cheddar just 5 hours ago, nice little village :)
Can you make a muenster (The American kind) cheese? Not the French Munster....
i wanna be your neighbour so i can taste your fresh cheese
greetings from israel... in the past 6 months i entered the world of cheese making and i was hooked instantly... of course a channel as yours is so helpfull, but i have a few questions that are probbly due to cultural differnces. if you mind answering, thank you. 1 - I see you heat the milk to 31c' in most of your vids... is that milk pasteurized? or is it raw? 2 - In some of your vids you are using a hand spray to disinfect germs, what does it contain? and in what concentration? or dosage? thank you very much, Eran Jakoboviz.
Hello from across the pond Can't wait to see this masterpiece! Subscribed!!!
Have you heard of using something other than Annatto to turn the cheese yellow-orange? It triggers my Crohn's Disease, but hubby swears white Cheddar tastes different! Do you think turmeric would alter the taste, or not color match the Annatto? Thank you.
Thank you Gav!!
Thank you very much Gav , i stopped making cheese about 9 months ago the wife went vegan so we tried to support her ,Used up our stock on the boys work lunch so im going to get back into it, thanks for simplifying the cheddering process for some reason i was draining the whey off each time  wrapping the cheese back up and dipping nto warm whey for 15 min  think i'm going bonkers and mixing edam and chedder recipes up
Watched all your vids, but (probably rhetorical question),  have you attempted (low fat) (small or large curd) cottage cheese "cheese,"  or yogurt or kefir cheese (w/, w/o fruits, nuts ingredients)?  Most likely need to do the calcium chloride and rennet to remove water and whey to firm/dry up the product first.  Do as a cold process (saving yogurt/kefir probiotics).
Hi Gavin, I made one like this, but with butter, 1 month ago and it's all coverd in mould right now. I keep it in covered plastic box to make sure that it's humid enough. Do you think should I continue to age it like that or should I open the box? I plan to let it age also for about 6-7 months, and by the way, in my small fridge-cave, I really can't make humidity that high, so I have to wax my every cheese or in this case, to keep it covered. Thanks!
What does the cheddaring process accomplish?
Six Months ... Merry Christmas in advance then :)  Gavin I looked at the recipe and followed out the link on the calcium.  Locally, a 30% solution is sold, and yours is 50%.  Is the amount a critical value or does it come to "0.75 to 1.25 grams is good" type of range?
Can you use the cloth  banding method when making Farmhouse Cheddar?
I've been avoiding doing the bandaging because I didn't want to cover my cheese in lard. Hadn't heard of using coconut oil. Great idea! Now I'll definitely be giving it a try.
Which would you say would make the cheese taste better, wax or cloth?
Great video.
