“That dress” was always white and gold to me 😂. But one day found if i looked at it from top to bottom i saw white n gold and if it was bottom to top I saw the black and blue! 😮
Is that rose gold cake covered in buttercream frosting?
Super and beautiful
Your cake looks fabulous 🤩 can you please tell me the size of each cake 🥺?

Wonderful,  I will do this for my daughter.
Thank you for taking the time to do this informative video. Massively appreciated. Can we replace the paste with fondant?
So, so beautiful… Thank you for sharing…. Like it🌸
Your tutorial is amazing. What if I want to do it over buttercream?

Hi can I know  some information  from you.  I am beginner  of the cake. I want to make 3 tier cake for my birthday.  Can we make 3 tiers from the  sponge cake? Lots of people  are saying  to make  it from butter cake. But I like sponge  cake.  Please if you can,   tell  me some  ideas.   Tks
Thanks you
I've learned so much ! thank you!
Beautiful cake😍😍😍 I have one question about it, do you leave the painted top tier to dry in fridge or you leave it at room temperature? Thank you!
This is freaking gorgeous!! I love how symmetrical your cakes look and how you break it with the roses fluidity.. :)
Hi. After applying first layer of rose gold paint, you leave it dry out or refrigerate??
Perfect!

God bless you Mam for sharing your knowledge
Wow love it
What's the size of the cake, please?
You are incredible, this is my dream job but I’m rubbish at it lol!!
Could you use the painting technique with buttercream instead of fondant?
What brand of fondant do you use?
me encantó!!! excelente trabajo, gracias x enseñarnos tu procedimiento 🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗
Where did you get your artificial flowers from?
Can you use a gel for pink color?
Fab tutorial. I'm going to try this as a topsy turvy cake, but with the glitter rose gold.
Hi may I ask where you can buy ingredients you use in the rose gold?
Amazing  top
Wow this cake is beautyful
Hi, At firts, sorry for my bad Englisch.  I saw the sizes were 5 and 7 inch. But I like to know how high the cakes were and how many layers do you us? Thanks in forwards for helping me...  Loves Emilie
Hi Lovely work I loved the way u marbled the bottom layer !!  PLzzzzzzz explain how do u travel with the cake ?????????????????? I noticed u didnt connect the  2tiers  2gether    Thank u 4 sharin ur work with us
So elegant an stunning! I have question about the top tier. Is there a tutorial on stacking the cake with the cake drums? Is the cake drum completely covered with the white icing and at the beginning when you're painting it and its elevated is the cake already on the cake drum? Sorry I'm new to caking if the question sounds silly. Thank you ever so much! xx
Thank you for the video. Do you have a video on how the make the cake itself? Thanks.
This is so beautiful! V helpful as well. Excellent work!

Lovely tutorial😍
Muy bonito, pero yo no le pongo agujas a nada que se coma.
I also decorate cakes but only use Italian Meringue Buttercream.  I have an order for cake that needs to be glammed up and would love to paint it rose gold.  My question is if I let the cake get really cold and set up could I paint the IMBC cake or would that not work?  Thank you.

Will the sugar paste harden on the cake?
Everything on the cake should be edible. Ribbon and everything. It's just I feel that way.
Were the cakes 6 and 5 inch
So beautiful
Wonderful thank you 😊
Thank you for this in-depth-tutorial!
Can ask which Sugarpaste you used
So pretty!
Beautiful, simple yet stunning. ❤️
Beautiful 🌸

Thank you so much for your time and generosity. Greetings from Texas.
Beautiful
very nice it was worth the time thank you very much
😍😍😍
Nice job,Thanks for sharing GOD you
Can I airbrush the rose gold instead??
Where is the description box below , cannot find it
Me encanto... super lindo... beutiful.😘😘😘
So really wow😍
What fondant do you use?
for me rose gold color is more like the metal so it would have na orangey tint to it (but not too orange. so i guess more of a dark peach) but i'd also lump metallic rose in with rose gold. i'd probably call it pastel rose gold tho. and i agree that dress thing was stupid.
Beautiful
Hello, my name is Driele, I'm from Brazil. I really like your videos! I wonder if you really enjoy shopping? here is not so thick
So nyc  What’s the name of roses please
Spanish please!!😊
Beautiful Job!!!!
JUST BEAUTIFUL!!!
Absolutely awesome
Thanks 😍
Well, for me it's not eatable at all: a needle in a cake, artificial flowers and a black ribbon....and its for Birthday....In my country, and in every country, black ribbons and artificial flowers are used most for funerals. We give people real flowers and cakes with eatable flowers. When guests start to eat this cake, what should they do with these flowers and Black ribbon with a needle? If they take them of, then this cake will look without any decorations...Sorry, but this is really a bad idea cake. Your work is very accurate and great, but please don't make such 'strange' cakes. Best wishes)
Beautiful
Lovely
Great work!
That was a very pretty cake
Very nice. Thanks
Simply beautiful, well executed, a pleasure to watch.

Hi! Thank you so much for this video! I am looking for a mix to achieve rose gold color and your tutorial helps! May i also ask, what color combination you would use to achieve rose gold color using food gel? I need to use it to color my buttercream. Thank you in advance!
I love it.
This is beautiful!
Hey! Happy New year 😊 just watched this video again and I'm confident about painting now but just two questions... how long inbetween each layer of paint for it to dry? Whilst it's drying, what do you do with the paint to stop it drying out too so you can use it again for the next coat? Hope I'm making sense  Xxx
😩😩this cake is sooo beautiful 😍
Beautiful job
Perfect
Hermosas creaciones, sería bueno subtitulado en español
Where did you get the flat large paint brush?
Amazing cake, approximately how much should it cost?

Mam those roses are artificial or any sugar paste??
I agree with you on rose gold color. I'm also been having this same argument with my sister.

Thank you for the very quick response.... very much appreciated.  I will try this next time.
Gorgeous cake.  Two questions. Is sugar paste the same as fondant?  Also, how long did you wait for the colour to dry in between ‘coats’?
Would I be able to get this look with buttercream instead of paste?
Where did you get the roses from?
Hey! GREAT cake! Wondering if you have a cakeboard in the smaller, second cake (as its tall!)! Need answer asap 🙈 thank you for your awesome tutorials!
Your tutorials are wonderful, I've never been able to learn so easily, you've changed my world, thank you so much for sharing your knowledge! I can not stop watching your tutorials. God bless you 👏🏼❤️🙏🏼

How long should you leave to dry after each coat of paint x should I leave it in room temp or place in fridge or freezer x
Beautiful cake

Wow!! BEAUTIFUL!! 😍😍😍

Heya. It's me again. Can you share a tutorial or tips on how to cover a tall 8" cake?
Where did you buy the artificial roses from? I bought some recently for the same type of look... stupidly didn't look at the size and they were tiny! 😭🙈
Thank you for providing so much information
Perfeito
Can anybody tell me what's the purpose of using sticks?
Beautiful thank you
Tarda mucho hablando
Hi - this cake is beautiful! What size cake pans did you use for the 2 tiers, and how many layers?
Love it
The cake was amazing, the black bow unnecesary.
It would've made more sense to put daisies on the cake instead of roses lol Gogeous cake though 😍😍
This is a beautiful cake! I love the rose gold color, you did a great job finding just the right shade! 🙂 Very, very lovely cake!
soooo gorgeous <3 amazing ideas/techniques you have showned <3
Love it!!!
Nicely done. Can you please link the transfer/writing paper you wrote on ?
LOVE your videos you are so Tala Ted and generous with the information you share..
Really pretty but I dont like the artificial elements
Absolutely gorgeous.
Absolutely love the cake! I was wondering what were the heights of each cake?
Love your videos, thank you so much for sharing. I have been experimenting with lustre but have been using rejuvenator liquid. I found it evaporates really quickly and am left with lots of powder on cake. Do you think I’m using too much lustre. Your lustre mixed with vodka seems a thinner consistency than what I’ve been using, mine also has some streaks bu5 maybe not letting it dry long enough, . How long would you let it dry between coats. X
Stunning
Stunning cake! Where did you get your flat brush from please?
you are amazing!!!
MUITO LEGAL SEU TRABALHO! AMEI!
love the video, beautiful cake, i was thinking maybe for the marble effect a mirror glaze would work well? what are your thoughts on that? this is assuming you wouldnt be scribing anything on the cake, id figure a mirror glaze just would not work if youre trying to write something
Hi. I love your videos, they are so detailed. Can I ask what recipes you use for your cakes? Would love to hear more about starting up selling your cakes as this is my dream. Thanks 🙂
Hi ! Can you advise how much sugar paste you would use for these cakes? Thank you

It turned out so elegant! Love it!! And I found black roses today and thought of you!! All the Halloween stuff is out now here in the US 😩😩 have you ever steamed a cake and dry dusted it?? It applies luster dust BEAUTIFULLY!!! Probably wouldn’t have worked for this one as you had to custom mix the colors, but it’s the only way I seem to be able to cover a whole cake without streaks!
Love it 😍😍😍Thank you😘
Love all your tutorials!  Absolutely love this design! Thank you!
This is a gorgeous cake😊
