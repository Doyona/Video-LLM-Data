Did it in school a few weeks ago, best day of my life. I forgot the process and came back to look on how to make it
My grandparents had a dairy farm and I can remember shaking cream till it turned into butter.
Love this, thank you!!!
Wow so incredibly easy tysm
I'm making mondo butter from danganronpa. Thank you for this tutorial. Monokuma approved 👍
Thats amazing how long does the butter last ? And do you keep it in the refrigerator after ?
Just tried this, got a surprising amount of butter. My arms hurt
I always have this song stuck in my head. Dindin din di-din... *happy acoustic guitar strums*
I love this recipe, made it, and was very happy with it.    I am just curious why others say the store bought is sour?    This was not sour at all.    Thank you.
Seriously Cool  My 2nd tutorial.  Watched 1st one earlier,  this popped up.  Im saving just these two,  Awesome Tutorials.   Now i know what to do with extra heavy cream
Why it white??? Butter is yellow! What is heavy cream?  We just have milk and cream where I live.
Why, in God’s name would anyone want to go to such trouble to make (at greater cost) homemade butter - when you can but perfectly good butter at the store?
Do you use room temp cream or cold? And dont knead the butter to clean it well??
Thanks 👍👍
Thanks for the Video I almost thought I did something wrong until I washer your Video it came out so good
My grandmother showed me how to do this when I was a child except we used a gallon glass jug and fresh cream from the cow. What great memories. Thank you for sharing.
You discard the buttermilk? Yeah I save it and use it in other things. Really rubs me the wrong way when people just throw things away that are valuable
Mine did not turn out like this, it is delicious, but not like what is shown
I'm super lazy and can't read through all the comments. I'm looking to make honey butter. Do I add the honey before I strain the liquid from it?
How do you keep it soft?
Nope
Why can’t you just use a machine as oppose to all of that shaking? 5-6 minutes is quite a bit of shaking
Well, that was an epic failure.  I managed to make Salty whipped cream after 7 minutes of shaking. So, there's that...
I can't get past the creamy ice cream finish and shook it for a long long time why can't I get to the next step of the butter separating from the liquid
Do you always have to use clear water every time you use it or just that one time
I'm never going to the store and buy butter ever again now I know how to make homemade butter wow
See, Cooking with Jack? THIS is how you make butter!
can you freeze the butter??
Help! Why is mine looking like whip cream
Back in the 70s and 80s my parents had an old butter churn made of medal you cranked. We called it the finger smasher because every small child who played with it smashed their finger.
I shook for 25 minutes I got whip cream and carpal tunnel
Am going to make this , one question does it need to be stored in the refrigerator afterwards? Thank you 😊
I did this and the butter came out super soft, not hard enough to form into a ball. I thought if I kept shaking it though it would turn back into cream. Did I not shake it long enough or is it supposed to be super soft?
I looked for your buttermilk chocolate cake but couldn’t find can you please help me locate it.
For the algorithm.  November 2024. Looks fun I'll try this!
I would
I just drink the butter milk after.. but I use it for baking too. Of course.
all due respect to the 'pioneers' and the midwest--THEY DID NOT SHARE THEIR HERITAGE BY MAKING BUTTER FROM HEAVY CREAM IN A CARDBOARD BOX.  Next video.
The "pioneers" who "settled" the west. 🤣 Revisionist-History Propaganda. 🙄 Rolled my eyes so far I almost had a reaction. 🤮
i dont have a mason jar but i have a baby bottle my toddler obviously doesnt use now. i think it will work .. fingers crossed lol
thank you for proving that Jack Scalfani is a liar and a scoundrel
I think I made something and completely different I used heavy whipping cream, And now it's just like whipped cream, but taste like butter and a bit salt but there's no liquid to it whatsoever.  It's like a blizzard ice cream where they can tip it upside down it. Does not shift or fall out, but it's still like whipped cream but still tastes like Butter.
Amazing
🌺♥️🌹🌸❤️🇨🇦🌷🌸
Use a rock tumbler the jar rolls inside the hard rubber barrel , when you hear it thumping it's stiking to the walls of the jar and turn of the tumbler BAMB !
Is it wrong this video gave me a boner?!
Putting the salt in with the  cream, you will end up with salt in your buttermilk and not really taste it in your butter.  Best to knead the salt into your butter after you rince out your. butter.
Did this in Elementary School in the 60s.  A girl in my class brought some milk in from their cows.  Passed a couple of jars around the class room shaking it until  we had, and then we put the butter on saltines crackers.  This video brought back good memories and made me think of simpler times.  Thank You!
Most store bought butter has additives & preservatives in it so making your own butter means that it is free from those things.
AWESOME...Thank you!
About how much salt would you add to make salted butter? And would adding salt to the heavy cream make the buttermilk salty also?
Uh, no, shaking a Mason jar for 6 minutes wasn't in any way a form of entertainment.  My great-grandparents WERE pioneers.  If you had a cow, you had a butter churn.  My mother used the old fashioned type.  Later, butter churn jars came along that had paddles you put into the jar that were attached to the lid and also attached to a gear that you turned by hand.  Neither method was fun, it was a chore for the kids to do.
It doesn’t work 😢
i didn’t believe it would work but it did! thanks
Thank you for this incredibly informative video
If I want salted butter, how much salt should I use?
This took longer than expected 😂 but it did come out wonderfully. Thank you 😊  I didn’t feel like dragging out the heavy mixer 🤪
Thankyou, I shall try this ❤
I just tried this with heavy whipping cream and it didn’t work. Geeze mom let us do this all the time. But it was fresh cream off the milk
너무 좋고 이해가 쏙쏙 되네요♥🥰
So I can just add alittle honey 🍯 to make honey flavored butter?? Thank you so much can’t wait to try
Awesome!! Thank you
How do you know when it spoils? Do you store it just like regular store bought butter?
Love it am gonna try it!
This seems like a great exercise for one’s arm muscles.
This reminds me of the shake weight episode of southpark
You can skip working out your arm on gym day for this 😉. I looked this up first time I hard you can make butter like this 🙂
If one is arthritic how else can you separate?
Can I just use a hand mixer?
Walnut grove in Vancouver wa
We did it in kindergarten I forgot how so here I am
Made this with my daughter today. We used the sea salt we made the week before. It was delicious,  thank you.
I add salt at beginning
❤ I love how you go step by step
That was so easy. I could use the exercise too. Thank you😊
As expensive as whipped cream is you're better off buying butter.
Commercially produced butter has a pale yellow colour, but home made butter is almost pure white. The taste of home made butter is out of this world.
Can you use pasteurized homogenized milk?
My mother did this all the time when she was a kid. She said they would add a little salt and roll the jar across the floor several times.
Tip.... have a few kids to take turns shaking it !
This is great! How long does this last in the fridge ?
Nice video, thanks for sharing a bit of your childhood with us.
Good on darl for a recipe thanks
whats the difference between heavy cream and heavy whipping cream my stores only have the latter
I tried this last week, its amazing how easy it was, no fancy equipment and an amazing ball of butter! Thank you !
If you want salted butter how much salt do you add?
Should I add the honey with the cream or after butter is made
Used to hand me a gallon jug half full of fresh cows milk. My job was to sit in a rocking chair with that jar in my lap and rock till the butter was made.
So glad I came across this! Room temp heavy organic whipping cream and oh my what wonderful butter we have - Thank you so much!!
I remember doing it in baby jars in girl scouts 😊
Man I've been shaking hard af for 8 min. And im a pro at this motion. And I still got whipped cream.
Cool! 🎉  I would make a bracket to attach that Mason jar to a Sawzall = BOOM 1 min butter..
We had a small dairy when I was litter in the 50s.  My mom would put some raw milk in a crock bowl and cover it with cheesecloth and ut on the icebox. When the crealm rose to the top she ut that in a churn and we kids took turns using the dasher to finally make butter.  We were so blessed to  grow up in those times.
This is awesome
Absolute filth! That’s what it is!
Nice 😏
Thanks for sharing!
How do you know how much salt to add? I wouldn't wanna add too much & ruin it.
Thanks for sharing this. I’m ready to try this
I used 36% fat, cold from the fridge and it took 30 min. of shaking.  Tastes great!  Next time I will try using room temp. cream.
Holy cow, butter is good this way!
If we were still doing these things our children wouldn't be so fat
Do you have to refrigerate the butter?
Wow!! Thank you!! Great information!!👍😊
Is this whipping cream? I can't find just heavy cream
That fresh buttermilk makes the BEST pancakes!
Really cool. 😊
Thank you
You  are  the  best  !   Great  job  Thank  you  🙌😇❤👏👏👏👏👏👏👏🙏🙏🙏
Nice simple, straight to the point step by step recipe video. Tysm! It’s been years since I’ve made butter and I just wanted to refresh my memory and this video was spot on. Definitely got a new sub with me 😊
I've been churning with whisk for a week and it's still not out 🤣
Would like to add that the cream should be cold to start. We used Amul box heavy cream. We are in India. Chilling cream now. We will see how it works out with round 2!
How long does the butter last for in refrigerator
Hello. My name is Cathie, and I just watched your video on how to make homemade butter. My Dad made homemade butter one Christmas when I was a girl, using the hand mixer. It was fantastic! Thank you so much.
Thank you sis
Seriously gonna try this.
I put my butter in a ball and then put it in the water and it dissolved 🤣 other then that It is great 👍
it would be helpful to say how much salt
SON of a biscuit!!! Got it?   biscuit. I made butter and in a jar.  Everything I am learning, thanks. I was afraid about the fat content. My was not 30% but the highest I could find was 6%. Let's see if that makes a difference. Thanks
I had no buttermilk left in the jar it's mildly creamy like Texas Roadhouse honey butter
Can i use plastic Mayo jar
I’m about to make some right now to put on some campfire potatoes. I just needed to double check how long it takes by jar. Thank you so much for this helpful video!!!!
How solid are you looking for in the butter? How hard should it be before you know it's done?
Absolutely brilliant
Hi there. I did as you said and shook it for about 8 minutes. The butter had separated from the liquid but the ball of butter was soft. Do I shake longer? Thanks.
1 thing i dont get.... to make heavy cream you need butter... but to make butter you need heavy cream.... so which comes first?
hi
I'm betting she grew up in the "Mormon Spine" (Idaho, Utah, Arizona). We did this when I was a kid in Idaho, both in church and school, and then at a church activity again in Arizona.
Will half n half work or regular whole milk work
Thank you!! How long can we leave the butter out on counter before it goes bad? I love to have it soft but not sure if I can leave it out on counter before getting g that rancid taste.
It's like MAGIC 🪄
You'll never have to lift weights.
Thats cool
how long will the butter last in the refigerator
I remember doing this in 3rd grade science class
Question: how long will this butter last in the fridge? Thanks
<3
mine came out really soft and I couldn't form it (I made my heavy cream from scratch so that might be it
1:49 😎
Just made butter for the first time omg im so happy 😀 i used room temp cream so it didn’t take that much time.
My grandmother used to tell me they made their butter at home this way, they would milk the cow, let the milk sit in a special bottom pour glass jug and drain off the milk from the cream, then put the cream in mason jars and shake like you did. The process you showed was the same as what she described. I just never knew you could make it from heavy cream until now. Looks like I will be making a trip to the store tomorrow to try it out.
I couldn’t seem to get it past the whipped cream stage, what am I doing wrong?
For the viewers that made this how does it taste?
Love this video!  We did the same activity as kids in Alabama
Thank you
I churned cream into butter in a jar 60 years ago
How can I make maple flavored butter? Adding maole syrup or maple syrup sugar? Or just sweeteend butter...sugar or powdered sugar.
Thank-you so much
How long well it keep
Mmm budder
Cream is just as expensive as buying butter, so what is the point of making butter at home? Just adding wasted energy to make something which is often times cheaper to buy.
I know this is an older video. But I still  have to say thank you so so much for your video! My wife and I have a new to us 20 acre farm that we JUST took over. Now neither of us is a so called “city slicker” but we don’t know everything about farming either. Now no matter all that we’re still excited to learn to get our hands dirty and to provide for our family.
Do you add honey or herbs before you shake or will that disturb the process? Thanks!
Now THAT was AWESOME!!!
alright so my mind is blown...goodnight lol
Can you use any jar?
Shake weight what? F that imma work my arms out and make a treat as a reward 🤣
I did this and just got a little bit thicker cream. No butter...
I tried but it never got past the whipped cream stage. I used a small jar cause I only wanted a little bit of butter…can using a too small jar prevent it from separating into butter??
No way its that easy??
Lucky man whoever she married.......
I’ve been shaking for 25 minutes and I have a lovely garlic whipped cream lol I can’t get it past the whip cream stage help!
did you use chilled cream?
If you add fresh  finely chopped garlic and a little bit of salt you will get the absolutely best garlic butter you've ever had! That and a fresh loaf of Italian bread and you will have better garlic bread than any restaurant! Just yummy!
No salt??
Thanks for the recipe God bless you I'm from south Africa bye
Mine never went past whipped cream. Shook it for 24 minutes and nothing. Something is missing 👎🏼
There was nothing to strain out when i did it lol. Then it just turned back to whip cream when i added water. Felt like i did it wrong.
Thanks--will go perfect on my toasted banana bread on this New Year's morning.   Made it in third grade, about 50 years ago.  Now it just has to made.
I just made my first batch. It took me a LOT longer than I expected, like 45 minutes! Two mistakes I made was, I should have let the cream warm up first and I should have started out the hand mixer at a much higher speed. Oh well, live and learn.
😲 I had no idea it was that easy!
Mine turned into whipped cream and wouldn’t get past that :(
It worked perfectly, but WOW my arm hurts haha
I love the histidine behind it and me and my husband just made it together, cause dang, it takes some aerobics stamina 😂 we had a blast!
I assume you mean what we call 'double cream'  or whipping cream, I've never heard of 'heavy cream'
Does anyone know the shelf life or what it should be
I don’t understand why you pour water into butter ?
It’s very nice 👍 thank you 🙏
That was amazing!  You are the sweetest I have ever seen!  Thank you for your story of how you grew up making the butter!
It takes me three days to make my butter.  I put 1/2 gallon of heavy cream, divided,  into 3, quart canning jars, and add 1/4  cup of buttermilk, or cultured sour cream. (Either will work, all you want is the right  strain of bacteria, which is the same in  both.)  Stir or shake the starter in, and  leave on the counter for 2 days.  After the wait, you now have 3 jars,  about 2/3rds full of sour cream. (Yes, you can use it like regular sour  cream, and you'll never buy sour cream  again.)  Follow her directions to make the butter,  from your home made sour cream.  steve
I add a teaspoon of salt to mine
It would help to become friends with paint guy at homedepot
Can you freeze it after?
Great video!  Thank you so much.
Can you make butter with buttermilk or are you using heavy cream?
Thanks for sharing. If you had cats, or dogs, I think they would lap up the 'rince' water from the butter making process as a treat.
Why it can't just be plain milk
Thank You..
I remember doing this in middle school. We all shook & passed it around the class
No tiene subtitulo al español.
Wow.. thank you!  My first time making real butter and so easy! Love from Chicago..New subscriber
How much salt would I add to it? Regular table salt?
Thanks for the lesson…will use it.
why have nhave dosnt do it
Shoot, get a paint shaker lol
Thank you 💖💖💖
👏👌
Does this method work with almond milk and coconut milk????
Yes I’m on a zoom call and yes I’m watching how to make butter 🧈 🧈🧈🧈
Can you overshake this?
Wow that is so easy!! It’s very practical to me!! Thank you
Hey look, its Molly Shannon.
😘
At what point would you add the salt or herbs? Right into the cream at the beginning?
I made butter in school
Going to make this.  1:04, this part will be the easiest....😏
Mine didn't work 😕
I'm so glad I found this video cuz I just saw a tiktok video where the guy just put on some crazy shit, whipped it off and that was it. Instant butter.
I am panting very hard for butter!
I used table cream at 18% but I don't think it was high enough. Been shaking for about ½ hr and still liquid 😩
No sé que ver para hacer stream bien para butter ayuda
Exotic butter
Can we do this with blender?
Can we do this with blender?
Hi, once made, how long is the butter good for?
This was such a great and simple video. I really enjoyed it and I learnt to make butter. Thank you!! 😀
How much buttermilk do you get?
I bet it tastes so much better than the store bought
I tried this but only got whipped cream. What did I do wrong?
I do have a question: can I use a blender instead of shaking?
Amazing. Can you use yogurt to make butter as well?
this was very bad i didn’t like it :(
❤
I did this years ago with my kids for a project after going to a dairy farm for a homeschool field trip and they loved it. Going to try it again with my younger kids who are older enough now, and since my favorite butter is no longer being sold.
Mmmmmmm!
Does it need to chill the heavy cream?
well.. that'd be an exercise 😌
Is it heavy sipping cream or heavy cream edit I ment to say whipping
Will they work if I don't have a mason jar
Thank you !! It worked!  As a first time butter maker, here are some observations.  Heavy whipping cream/ heavy cream by U.S. law must have a minimum 36%fat content.  Regular whipping cream is 30%. The various brands do not show percentage. Use the heavy whipping cream. I used a 1 quart (32oz) Ball/Mason jar. Buy 1 pint (16 oz) cream so you have the jar half filled. I put the cream out of the fridge for about 1 hour. No sure if that made any difference.   After about 2-3 minutes shaking, I could feel the cream getting a little thicker. After about 10-12 minutes I thought I was finished because I could see a ‘lump’ in the jar. I opened it. It kinda ‘looked’ like butter, but it looked more like slightly yellowed whipped cream. There was NO separation of butter and liquid.  So I shook it another 2-3 minutes then magically saw butter AND some liquid (buttermilk). So the bottom line is you have to see the lump of butter AND some liquid.  Use cold water to strain it through a strainer. Remove from the strainer and place it in a bowl to rinse. The water should be ‘refrigerator’ cold, not tap water. You can save the buttermilk if you want. I waited until the butter was rinsed to add salt, stirring with a fork. I used ¼ teaspoon of kosher salt, which has half the sodium of regular table salt.  Haven’t tasted it on some bread but ¼ teaspoon tastes about right.  The one pint of cream netted about 5 oz. of butter and about 8 oz buttermilk. I would suggest you make this a family affair with 2 adults with 32 oz jars, and the kids with the smaller babyfood jars, so you have more butter when done. I froze the butter in some empty 8oz butter/margarine tubs. Regards, Mike
I’m late but here’s a tip: use a cheese cloth to strain. It’s super cheap and works like a charm
Thanks this was helpful and tasty
I don’t even need butter but now I gotta try this!
I love fresh made butter I still make my own with  antique butter Turner that screws on top of one gallon pickle jar I like the sour cream butter too which takes longer to make cuz you have to set it out for a couple days in a dark place
We put a few marbles in the jar growing up to help mix
Thank you for this! I knew it could be done and I wanted to make my own, but didn't know how. Now I do and very soon I will make some!!!
This is by far.. the fastest and easiest was to make butter that I have ever seen... the other ones I saw used some other ingredients like buttermilk, yogurt and mixers.... nope... yours is just heavy cream and a mason jar.. XD
Love it
Awesome! Buttermilk can be frozen in ice cube trays and stored in ziplock freezer bag so none is wasted. I got tired of throwing out buttermilk.
Why are you wasting the buttermilk???
i want to tr and make it
Someone please ytp this
Cool
Does it have to be the fattiest butter you can find or can it still work with butter that is not very fatty?
she looks way too excited for this or maybe im sleep deprived
In my village in Poland we used to make butter in an old top load washing machine 😂
I did it school 48
I did it at my school
I am gonna try this! I've never made butter before, but if its this simple then why not?
Can u use rosemary and time to flavour it
Thank you for sharing this.
Hi
I was passing it around the class I was teaching got to butter stage and kept going now it's whip cream style butter kinda like margarine
Can you over shake it
She looks like a girl I grew up in my church. But way older.
I LIKE THIS LADY
CLICK WHAT for recipe????
Can you over shake this ? I had it separated but instead of butter it was soft like whipped , I kept shaking for an hour it never separated.
Can you make this with cows milk?
Thanks so much for this!  You gave me the missing link I was looking for.  I had made butter before in the past but it would not firm up well and started spoiling so quickly.  Now after watching your video I realize that it still had too much butter milk left in it.  I strained and washed off all the butter milk like you suggested and voila...perfect butter!!  It tastes delicious and my family is so impressed!
Please call me to remodel your cabinets. I can replace that corian counter with some beautiful granite.
Can I wisk it Because I don’t have a jar
You are super cute - love this recipe.
I see no reason to discard the liquid.  It's delicious in coffee.
Probably wont see this but I'm looking to add fresh fruit to my butter like strawberries and oranges. Can u do this ? And how long would it last in the fridge
I use my mixer... makes magic.
If you put a marble in the jar before shaking it will turn into butter faster
This video is worth millions of dollars.  Thanks for sharing your story as well as this life tip! Make your own! Waste less food!
The fresh butter milk is great as an all natural hair conditioner! Waste nothing! I can leave the recipe for the hair conditioner if anyone wants.
Why the heck are butter makers not out of buisness lol
Can we use half and half instead of heaving cream?
Feel guilty about the butter? Dont worry the calories fly off shaking it. 😂 great idea and video like and subbed 😎
AYYY WESTCOAST GANGGGG  I remember Pioneer Day lol. It was the most exciting part of 4th grade. We made butter (in the baby food jars lol) and bread.
I love the taste of homemade butter
Can i make this with cooking cream?
Very nice,  I wanted to make , now finally I can, thanks
Can I do this in a protein shaker bottle?
Awesome, love informative content.
I grew up in Washington State and we did this in Kindergarten one day 😊
i have nothing to say lol
Putt heavy cream ( America) or double cream (England) in stand mixer and give it about 3-4 minutes on highest level with whisk attachment.
It was so cool to learn how to make butter in a jar via your childhood experiences. Thank you so much for sharing and I’ll be trying this process today. Thanks again!
too much work for millenials
I guess I been using whip cream as butter its takes a long time to make butter lol
I used regular cream. It took forever with a mixer !
just made it! it took a lot of shaking for mine, but I'd reccomend this to anyone looking for an old fashioned activity with a tasty result. plus, the possibilities are endless for the add-ins.
2:08 wtf look at her eyes 😂
I like it when she hard shakes.
I can just see my dumbass now shaking the jar and yeeting it on the floor.
She is so damn cute!!!Love her videos and recipes!!! ❤️❤️❤️
Dont forget the pinch of salt.
-MONDO NOT AGAIN-
It is easier to use a hand mixer or electric whisk,just takes minutes and saves on tiring out your arms! 😀
Stirring the whipped cream until it's yellow makes the process go a little faster
Just what I was looking for Thank you
Don't give up early thinking you can't shake it anymore when there is no liquid. It magically reappears. Good workout, too.
0:19  "The pioneers who settled the west" also loved slavery, killing the native Americans, and stealing the native Americans lands....
She's so sweet
thank you , just made my very own fresh butter.!!
6 min my ars... 10 mins later still whipped cream
Can you add sugar to make whipped cream
Mondo Owada: *sweating*
Ummm... no time to go through all heavy cream during this time and wasnt buying it to make butter lol why do all that work to make butter if i could just buy it? Im only making when im out.
How do you know if you have over churned it??
I made homemade butter with my boys when they were young. Each of the 4 got their own baby food jar. I also put 2 clean marbles in each jar and it came out great every time!
It did not work. Sad
A few years ago, I told a few of my military colleagues about this method to make butter, and the intense workout it provides. Well, they laughed at first. Then I showed up at PT one day with several cartons of heavy cream and some half gallon Mason jars.  I laughed as they worked for the next ten minutes, shaking the crap out of them. By the time they were done, no one doubted me anymore. Of course I got a fair amount of ribbing for that for the next year, but it was worth it. 🤣🤣
I watched a Victorian one where they had a butter churn with a paddle and I think this one is easier.I def want to do this.
This is amazing! Ran out of butter so I looked up how to make butter. I'm 54 a country girl and I've cooked and baked all my life and never heard of this. I guess I'm not as country as I thought lol. Bad thing is I don't have any heavy cream either.
Yummyyyyy
Nice...would it be beneficial to add that small spiral ball that comes included with protein shake cups from GNC?  I have a couple extra, and it can act as a whisk inside.
This video is very helpful
Y’all use a stand mixer 🤕
Can I do this with half and half?
I heard that u can make butter from sour cream too is it true?
I was very impressed that this worked . It took alot more then 8 mins but it worked great .
excellent, always fancied making garlic butter, im on it tomorrow. thanks very much
I'm super mad. I was already there after about 20 minutes of shaking, my arms hurting so bad, but it wasn't super separated yet (perhaps with a cheese cloth it would've worked, but not with just hands), but you could see the separation. So I kept shaking (my dad helped a bit) and FOR SOME REASON the thing decided to go back a step and look like whiping cream again :( I then got tired and used a mixer and nothing freaking happened. So I'm stuck with what tastes and looks like softened butter, no buttermilk (which I was really craving), sore arms and failure :(
You sound like a girl that reads the things on study weekly at school
Can use Fresh Panna?
I shook this for20 minutes. Nothing happened and the lid started spitting.
thanks! I've been eating so much butter, I wanted a way to do it manually so I would burn off calories for every amount of butter I made... so I ordered a $40 hand churner from amazon... and yes. I know, I should stop eating so much butter, BUT thanks to you, I just canceled that order and I'm gonna make some butter right now!
Pretty cool video and simple as ever instructions.  I will make with garlic and herbs. and another with cream cheese. Thank You .
I wonder how many times buttermilk was said in this video
1:52   Welp, at least I don't have to go to the store for heavy cream.
1. put heavy cream in jar 2. Duct tape jar to butt 3.shake what yo mamma gave you for 8 minutes 4. ????? 5. Profit.  At least that's what I do.
Is this why the shake weight was invented...
How to make the butter last long
Easy directions..and super cute..
Your shitting me...it’s that easy 😱
This is nuts. I'm making this tonight with my homemade bread. And going to be perfect for my Skyrim meal themed dinner next week!
I made butter in a Mason jar this week,  and I felt like a wizard!! It was SO good!
Thank you for the video! I remember making butter in the baby food jars in pre school 😅
Does whole milk work?
I’ve been shaking forever but it seems to stay at the powdery soft butter stage! How do I get to the nice more solid butter?
Thanks for the video. We can’t find butter anywhere due to the Coronavirus. Luckily I had heavy cream on hand and we were able to make our own.
Cool
making butter is saving us from carona
Great time to make some 😂
since everyones dieing of corona theres no butter at the store
Wow, I never would have thought it was that simple. I was eating toast and decided to type butter in the search bar and here I am. Learning how to make my own butter!
When do you add the salt?
Thank you sweetheart.
Personally, I like to keep my jar in the fridge for about 15 mins then put just enough salt to cover the bottom of the jar. After you have the butter separation, I keep the butter in the jar and keep shaking and pouring until there’s no more buttermilk coming out. I feel like I’m the only Californian that likes to make butter in a jar
The original shake weight
Thank you.  We smiled with you throughout.  I remember shaking the Mason jar on grammas back porch back in the 50s.  Thanks for the update on what I was doing.
Awesome.
How long does this butter stay good for?
Here is your cab fare.
I remember makeing this and ice cream in school when I was younger. One of the most fun things ever
Woah, works! Took 6 minutes, and pure muscle. (But worth it.)!
😱😱😱 I did this in third grade!!! I had no idea what we were doing but it the stuff tasted good so I ate the whole jar!😅 our teacher called it a sweet party...😖
Doesn't work
Will it affect the separation if you add the herbs before? Or should you add herbs after?
Butter. Not budder.
Can this butter be further clarified?
My dirty mind when I saw the Cream going in the jar.
Can you use ultrapasteurized cream to make butter
The best way to season the butter is actually after you rinse the butter. Putting salt in beforehand changes the taste of the butter milk
Hi! How long would you say it  will last? Exp. Date??
I did this in elementary school...it was so much fun
I will use my food processor or my blender, it take less effort.
how much honey do you add for honey butter? I'm assuming a few pinches of salt too?
💌  WOW! What a piece of cake 🍰   *THANK YOU* ♥️⚡️♥️ *THANK YOU* ♥️⚡️♥️ *THANK YOU* ♥️⚡️♥️  😬🙏🏽  XOXO  💌
👍📽
Man that was kool. I'm guna try it. Seems easy. Let's find out.
Okay but can i do this with creamer???? lol
I favor your educational video on making butter —seriously great job. But, it is deceptive to teach the belief that this continent's west wasn't already settled, way before any pioneer arrived. Thank you for the video
will butter always get hard in the fridge? I made a batch this morning and it was not very spreadable after being refridgerated.
Cool..just need to get a smaller jar I can use to store in the fridge with when I'm done since I don't go through butter that fast so smaller amounts of cream and a smaller container will serve me well here.
You ruined it, you could of used leftovers for buttermilk pancakes lol
👏👏👏👏 that save a lot of people money on butter
That wrist action 👌🏼
I used this in my home made only “Winter Snow” bagel recipe
Hi how are you today my name is Soultana
Can we make butter without milk
I grew up in Oregon and that was one of the things I remember doing as a kid as well :)
Good exercise!
I tried this and shook for like 8 minutes but ended up stuck with whipped cream. What the heck?
Great recipe Merry Christmas God Bless
I learned to do this in 4th grade. Our teacher had us each take turns shaking the jar.
You're really cool, thank you for the good video.
It’s nice to do for a special meal, but store bought butter is cheaper than home made.
sooo easy? :O  THANK YOU!
Butter recipe: need heavy cream  Heavy cream recipe: need butter  😅😅😅  Thank you soo much... I would Make it if I had heavy cream
That seems like a wonderful arm exercise
😲😲😲😲😲😳 that was  cool u saved people money on butter 👌👌🤩
Very sad. Wasted half my cream to just get the whipped cream stage. Shook forever. Nothing. From the time it was cold until it was room temp. Nothing. Good thing I have sticks as backup. .
I saw a comment that if you put a marble in the jar, it speeds up the process. Can I ask why you have rinse the butter?
Is it just me or does she look high? Lol
My butter came out perfect, only it took me 23 minutes to make.  I guess my shake is a little slower and weaker.  :D  Thanks!
Put it in a paint shaker
I am never buying butter again! Thanks.
wow, didn't know it was this easy to make butter. thank you!
Yay I can try real butter
Very cool to.watch and probably tastes good but I think I 'll buy mine.
Expected you to use buttermilk but this is a morr quicker recipe! what is the difference on taste though?
Wow really simple thanks
That's too much work. My arms will give out lol.
How the shake weight was invented.
Very helpful. First time I made  mine it still wet. Now I know 👍🏾
I use to make butter, it was time consuming. Ur way is much simpler, thx sharing ur knowledge.
It works 😊
Can I add cinnamon and sugar for making cinnamon toast? If so at what point do I add the cinnamon and the sugar. Thank you! Excellent video.
I was making butter before your parents where born! With fresh cow milk!!
Awesome video!
I did this in kindergarten with my teacher.
Does it have to be a glass jar??
This is the best butter you can get. No soy, no veritable oil, no salt (unless you want to add a little bit).
i just made this, i poured ice water while mixing with kitchen aid. i separated the buttlemilk and water, then rinsed again and tossed that water. much cleaner butter.
Thank you so much for this video! My family enjoys now home made butter!  My question is tho; how long can you store it in the fridge?
I was looking to buy the heavy whipping cream are we need total fat or saturated fat?
Wow, Great Idea. Cheaper Than Buying Butter At The Store. Great Excercise For Both Arms One Qt Jar In Each Hand. 😄
This is the dirtiest video I've seen on YouTube
Greetings! Thank you for saving our butter. We first tried a more traditional way to get in touch with our roots but then gave up and used an old jar like you! #Hero
Mine looks like whip cream...
Use a blender. This is a waste of time.
Supposed to add SALT!! Taste's way better than this recipe.
Awesome lesson!! Thank you for this.
I hope my mom doesn't walk in while I'm shaking this jar and watching the video with my back to the door 😂
Thank you I like your video presentation
Or you could just buy butter.
Mine was thickening then turned into cream again when i was shaking it wtf
This "butter" be easy...
My husband and I made this last night, for some reason it took up about 20 mins or so of shaking, but the result is delish and was ton of fun and great bragging rights haha.
thanks great video...a must try
Should I keep it refrigerated?
Just add 60g of quality flower and make the worlds best edibles!!!
I just made today and followed your instructions , it works and it taste better than store bought. Thank you
1:54 your welcome.
thank you so much for this. so easy and good exercise too!  unfortunately, we are getting too lazy and machine-dependent for our own good
I used to make butter - was so good- gonna go back to it.🤗🤗
I’m from Pennsylvania. We also did this to celebrate older cultures. We also had it in baby food jars! 🤣🤣🤣
Thanks for the info. 💜👍
Amazing
The first shake weight 😉😂
Love this! This gave me a flashback to kindergarten when our teacher had our class sit in a circle and she put cream in a mason jar and we all took turns shaking and then passing the jar to the person next to us. We were all amazed that we made butter. One of the few things I remember from 40 some years ago. Thanks for the refresher course. Very cool! 😉 👍🏼 ❤️
When should you salt your butter?
Screw shake weights. This is the exercise
Cool! I subbed cause I like how you think! ♡
WHAAAAAAAAAAAT WOMAN?!!!!!! Lol
I tried it... I can confirm that it does work. Thank you for sharing!
Ty nice video
There was no liquid and the thick cream looked like creamy frosting . . It had a non food flavor . . Heavy whipping cream . It did nothing but make a jar full of flavorless goo
My neighbors laugh at me because I make my own butter I make my own soap to but I know what I'm eating they do not and I know what I'm bathing with they do not
Omg yesss thank u so much for this video..i have a big family and we go thru loads of butter! I can get pretty expensive sometimes... if only i knew that I clda been using the heavy cream sitting in my fridge to make not only butter but butter milk too lol!
🤤oh my..... that's it?!! 😅I'm gonna try this
Can you make weed butter like this??
Thank you for sharing.   I can't wait to make it.
This is awesome! Thank you so much for sharing! Love this!
I loved this video and plan to try it ASAP. I really like the grass fed butter I’ve been buying so I’ll have to see if I can find grass fed heavy cream. I have a few questions though.   In the video you said add salt at the beginning for salted butter but in the description you said add it at the end. I know you could do it at the end but I feel like it would combine better if done at the beginning. Which is it? How much salt do you suggest?  I’m sure adding herbs at the end would be great but can you add them at the beginning or would that disrupt the process?  How long is the butter good for?  How long is the buttermilk good for?
She has buttery smooth skin
Good arm exercise while making this butter!! How nice is that? Thanks 😊
My sister once made some in Pre-K. I thought it was the coolest thing.
Reminds me of when we did Pioneer Day in 4th grade! We made butter in baby food jars.
Another simple diy food hack like putting condensed milk in a crock pot, still in the can and voila instant caramel
My grandmother used one gallon large mouth plastic jars for churning butter.  You strain the milk through cheese clothe and put the cream in the plastic jar.  Rock back and forth in the rocking chair while tilting the jug side to side.  Every three or four rocks you loosen the lid slightly to let the pressure out.  She had churns, but they were a pain to clean afterwards so she never used them.
Old school ! 👍👍👍
I dod this and it was soo much fun and my mom loves how it turned out thank you so much for this!
Fun great vid
This was my first time doing this. It come out perfectly! And very delicious. It spread well, but I refrigerated the rest and I think it may harden up some, but I am going to keep making our own butter this way. Thank you for this video.
Pioneers who settled the west?  OK I guess that one way of looking at it.
Can your use milk instead???
I have powdered heavy cream (Hoosier Farms brand) and wonder if that will work? Going to give it a try!
Wow I remember doing it for my aunt as a child..tnx for bringing that memory back...love from India
I grew up on our family farm and we had a Jersey milk cow.  We made our butter and drank the delicious raw milk!  Sooo yummy!
My cream was ice cold so it took a LOT longer, but after about 25 minutes I had the best tasting butter I’ve ever had in my life. My kids and I ate it on bread for dinner. My husband wasn’t hungry, but maybe he can try it on biscuits in the morning!
I forgot this. When I was a kid the milk was delivered to the door in glass bottles. No homogenized only pasteurized with the cream in the top third of the bottle. My brothers and would put some in small capped bottles and shake it to make butter. I will try again. 👍 video
All these years of working the shakeweight have prepared me for this challenge!  >:O
I bet they loved you in high school 😂🤣😂🤣
I’m NEVER buying butter again!!!! Thank you
Looks like a yummy treat!
Thank you! Great job!
Didn’t work
I enjoyed watching her rapidly shake that jar with two hands. I'd take her out for ice cream
We used to do this on camping trips as kids. You make the butter the afternoon you get there and then in the morning you make buttermilk biscuits spread with fresh butter. Lol took us significantly longer than 10 mins though.
Sorry but I have a immature mind and found this video hilarious
It's insane how simple this is. I was blown away by the simple way it was done. Very cool.
Can I use this method with raw, untreated milk?
Wow i love ur channel. New subscriber here👍🏼💗
How long does it keep
nice. how long does it last in the fridge? and does it work w/ ultra-pasturized? tks.
The pioneers did not settle the west ... there were true Americans already living there.  The pioneers stole the land, killed the wildlife, and destroyed many forests and streams.  Stop making the pioneers the good guys ... they were the invaders and destroyers of the west.  And it's still going on ... housing subdivisions built in low rainfall mixed vegetation burn to the ground ... as they should and the new pioneers cry like babies ... the animals cry for their lives lost and their habitat destroyed
Thank you so very much. Better butter  butter better Your butter was the best!.
This is great! Thank you!!
I accidentally made ice cream flavored butter 😭
I was today years old when I found out butter is made from heavy cream and muscles. Meanwhile Country Crock has a paragraph of ingredients for their butter recipe
Have you ever used actual cow milk
Omg!! This is just so fascinating! I NEVER knew this was even possible! So cool!
That's pretty nifty that ya still want to make butter like this... you said ya grew up in west, I wa as curious as to wear in the west... I live on the the central Oregon coast..
I did this raw milk. So not pastured. Full fat. Always chose milk from cows that a pasture fed and if given feed  it will be non gmo.
It's not cost effective...at all. It's almost twice as expensive to make your own.
You have nice hands.
Coolness!
I grew up a rugged city boy, never new that about making homemade butter in a mason jar and i love it simple and ez badass. thanxs
I may just take the jar to Home Depot , paint department! Lol save some few minutes! 🤦🏽‍♀️🙄😂😂😂😂
I thought butter was made out of milk? Plain old milk! 🤔🙄
Thank you. I'm going to attempt this cool recipe for butter. Do you have a simple one for Ghee? ❤
What a workout😭😂😂😂😂
Simply Brilliant. Thanks for such a great video. I honestly never knew it was so simple to make butter. Keep up the great work.
Looks awesome !
Can i use milk for this?
Well, this old kgn teacher was told the secret to make that special butter..use the special words... COME,  BUTTER, COME! SHAKE, SHAKE, SHAKE! COME, BUTTER COME, BUTTER SHAKE, SHAKE, SHAKÈ! must be done with kids sitting on a circle, passing the jar around,  each having a turn for entire verse!...lots of fun.
The fact you can get that much butter out of a pint of cream at the store. Vs getting half that amount out of a quart of real heavy cream from raw milk. Is unbelievable to me and I wonder what the hell are they putting in our food.
BRILLIANT
I like making honey butter this way.
Can you use the butter milk like normal milk say in your coffee ?
The pioneers who killed all the indigenous people
Oh wow! I make my own bread, and that butter is a perfect match! I’m going to try to make it, today ...  thank you 🍞☀️🌻🐝 blessings
Who needs a gym? Just make butter, baby! 👍🏼💪🏼👌🏻
Doing this with the kids...cannot wait
Thank you!  Never knew it could be so easy.
I accidenlt discovered how to make butter while I was trying to whip cream in a bottle 😂
❤💕
This is nice. I didn’t know. Plus, I have some of those Yoplai Mini jars - the shortest ones and I have some of those stretch silicone lids that actually fit them, although it wasn’t planned. I can make a separately-flavored compound butter for each jar, which is perfect for me as, I live alone.
By the time it separated I  became Amish...Navioner  is 100% right let it get to room temp...This must have been after I shook it for 30 minutes...Popeye arms now...
wow!
I like making blueberry ice cream in a jar with that stick blender.
1 day later - rock hard 😳
A stand mixer makes an excellent motorized butter churn if you don't feel like shaking a mason jar.
I'm floored by this video. I'm subscribing.
Wowow thanks for the video! No more buying butter!!!! I must try this!
We will be doing this
Great info, ty. My next step is to clarify it to remove the impurities and solids. I use mostly ghee (clarified butter) in cooking and butter for other.
Ive always wanted to do this again we did it in Brownies.
Bacon butter😏
I was thinking of churning butter.  How long does it keep?
I was looking up how to make butter homemade and foumd that you have to use heavy cream which i didnt have so i looked up how to make heavy cream. Turns out you need butter to make heavy cream lol now why would i use heavy cream to make butter when i had butter to make the heavy cream to begin with lol
THANK YOU KINDLY!
Just whack double cream in a food processor and turn it on........hey presto perfect butter will form, you'll also get some butter milk you can use to bake with if you want. Then towards the end after draining out the milk, add a lil salt to taste if you like me prefer salted butter.👍🏻 Just takes out the wrist action for those unable to do this method.
Cool you brought back some tearful memories 😊
Thanks sweetie
I didn't realize it was this easy.
Why use the buttermilk in a recipe? Drink it! You can't find real buttermilk anymore, only the cultured garbage.
I got lazy.use the blender work quicker..awesome
When the big one hit..those who left.just need youtube
Love country girl
how to die ....
My mom made butter on the electric mixer.
Video on homemade mayonnaise please, homemade ketchup, homemade mozzarella cheese.
Super cool. So glad I came across your video 👍
Shut the front door😱😀.  Home butter made that easy👍. So long Land O Lake's✌️👋🤚. Great Idea can't wait to try.
It looks so fake because it seems too easy!!! That is so cool.
Ok I tried this and it wouldn't get firm no matter how hard I shook... I got the highest cream I could but it wouldn't firm up :/ maybe if I make it cold it will work
Thanks for the video. Gonna give this a try
Last time I did it this way was in kindergarten. I just use my kitchen aid mixer.
I'd love to be her husband 😈🤣
That is so cool.
Is This keto approved?
OMG!!! I'm definitely doing this tomorrow. My mom and dad always told me that they as children helped in making butter. I have the old churn ceramic bucket with the handles on the side that my dad used as a child. But I'll be using the Mason jar tomorrow. Thank you so gery much for this easy demonstration.
Thanks. You're beautiful!
Can we store this in the fridge? For how long?
That is pretty neat 😃
Thanks for the tip.
Would this work with a blender?
We did this in kindergarten at an assembly. The jar was passed around the whole circle and we were shown butter at the end 😊  good times. I'm a vegan now, don't miss it too much. What I didn't know was that's where buttermilk comes from😁  hurrah!
I'm glad this was recomended. Thank you!
Will this stay good for the same amount of time as regular butter?
I use a hand mixer. Homemade is always best.
Buttermilk ice cream is awesome.
What if you want make it from scratch?
I'm from UK she said we can add URBS? What is that please and what does it do to the butter.
This is just beautiful. Thank you so much.
people hit hard times because of trump suddenly the youtube algorithm decides to teach people how to make their own butter. can the algorithm teach diabetics how to make their own insulin too?
Great video Stay at Home Chef.  My grand-daughter had a ton of fun making butter for her french toast, and learned a thing or two about how folks lived before super markets.
My siblings and I also made butter like this when we were kids on the 1960s and early 1970s.   We also used raw milk/cream for our butter - use to buy it from a local farmer in wide-mouth gallon jars...and each gallon would have like 2 inches of cream floating on the top of the milk.    My mom also use to make a sour butter.  She would let cream sit in the fridge and she would smell it every day.  The first day she smelled it and it smelled slightly 'off'   she turned it into butter.  So we had the choice of sweet butter and sour butter.   I rather liked the sour butter.
why not use a whisk or a stand mixer? there's a whole lotta shakin' goin on!
looks like white butter??
Why is it so pale? Store-bought butter where I am is yellow
We used to call this "Mormon butter".  Great stuff !
What else can we shake and see if it turns into something?
LOVE THAT YOU PUT YOUR YUMMY DELICIOUS RECIPE AND DIRECTIONS UNDERNEATH SO WE CAN HAVE THEM FOR LATER FOR PEOPLE LIKE ME WHO CANNOT COOK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH
Such a random recommendation but brought back so many memories!!!
I've done this many times.  It works MUCH quicker if you let your cream sit on the counter in the (closed) jar for several hours...it must be room temp.. you don't really even have to actually shake it, you can just let the cream slosh back and forth by turning the jar upside down and right side up.  When you don't hear a slosh, you have whipped cream. Keep going and you'll soon hear a slosh and a thunk...
My aunt used to do this with a gallon jar and a rocking chair.  She would put only an inch or two if cream in the bottom of the jar, sit in the rocker and slosh the cream back and forth as she rocked and watched her soap operas.
Can pasteurized cream be used
Awesome! Thank you for sharing.
I drink that milk dont toss it away
I bet I can use a paint mixer and get butter in under 2 minutes.
This is what the shake weight is for... Right?
Awesome... can you veganize this for me?
Her husband must be very lucky.
People can't boil water or peel potatoes you think they are gonna make butter?
Now all I need is a cow to milk....
Instead of buying heavy cream for your homemade butter, just buy butter.
I use to do the same way after my grand mom milked the cow
Is it your child hood or your people?
This looks a lot better than the way I've been making butter - thank you.
Yes. .and Thanks. .
Butter churns with a crank are readily available on Amazon. Store bought butter tastes a little better though.
could you use a beater for this?
Thank you! It looks so easy! Gonna try it with my grandsons.
I remembered over 45 years ago..... Used a large glass store bought jar to shake and, I don’t recall how many hours.   Until 24 hours later and took out a large stainless steel bowl from refrigerator.  It was a large amount of butter it was bit solid but good.
Once you pour it in the bowl, can you keep the butter milk?  If so, how long?  Thanks
Some call it "cow grease"...
How long does this last?
Omg, I witnessed a miracle!! Butter in a jar just by shaking the jar of heavy cream!! Hard to believe.
Thanks , I love learning new things 🖖
I love your channel, I was actually quite surprised to see how easy this was. I'm totally doing this from now on.
We live on a grass fed organic dairy farm and can get raw milk I'm goin to try this with the kids
I can remember churning butter in an old fashioned wooden churn with cream separated from milk straight from the cows.  What I didn't know was when or how much salt to add to make salted butter.  Is there a suggested ratio of salt to add .. like a per pint or quart amount?
I just want you to pull me off
"I'm going to sleep early tonight.... Me at 1Am:
I'd hit lol
Heavy Cream = approx $4.89 for size of container in video.  2lbs of Butter =  $3.89 at the same store.
I've been making butter since 1960, but we used fresh milk that had separated.....
Cool. But that will send your arms into convulsions.
Your husband or boyfriend must love you 😂
When I was a kid my Big Moma let me help her make butter in her churn. All of the grandkids helped. She made the best butter!!!
Yum
Oh he'll they have  if not before been doing that since the 1520's and it was goats milk in A stomach  of a goat. As they were walking  across the desert.... Duh.....
That’s it? Lol wow
Can't we just put the Butterball in a collander and rinse it off?
I haven't thought about butter making since grade-school.  Thank you for the memory and for the updated container size along with the rinsing steps which I do not recall from grade school!
Awesome!
You could do smaller jars and put in herbs or garlic after the butters is made. I remember when in was you and going to a relative's house and she had us churn butter with a real churn not a jar. Love this. Thank you.
I'm not sure how yummy buttermilk cholate cake would be  ',:^(
1:50
How much salt should be added to make it taste salty enough like store bought butter tastes? Also, I was wondering if I could add ground garlic to make garlic butter?
Yummmm!! When I was little I’d milk the cow then on to making butter and the buttermilk we put on our cornbread in a glass and eat it up!!! Lol
Love it thank you
Who knew?!!! Thanks for the video.
I made butter like this most days, often more than once a day, when I was 13 or 14. Its all in the wrist and fingers and even when you get tired you know the result is gonna be worth it.
"BUDDER",  you say ?
My only thing is how much does all that cream cost?! 😂😂  How can I make my own heavy cream? I bet I have to get a cow for all of this, don't I ?!  But this is definitely cool. Running out to get cream right now to try for myself. I knew I saved those jars for a reason. Thanks for the video!
I had no idea it was that easy...
Wow thanks for the intro about the pioneers...I’m Australian and found it interesting...I’m buying cream tomorrow and will see how I go
Ah, child labor. Jk 😋
Why don't you tell them to use that blender there in the background? I have a nice Blendtec, but a blender will do. Just pour the cream in, and in my Blendtec it takes 80 SECONDS to turn to butter. Salt it and use it, if you rinse it use COLD WATER only, then salt it and stuff it into a mold. I'm 73 and learned these techniques from Old Timers, but like sewing, if those women had had sewing machines they would have used them instead of sewing by hand. :) A whole lotta shakin' goin' on is I suppose good exercise, but a blender takes the work out of it, so you can do it all the time, not just when you're in the mood.
Cream pied
Neat. Thanks.
Wow thats sooo cool ty
I use my hand blender
I mix the heavy cream with a hand mixer, in a big bowl.. it’s fast.
i love practical people!
Wowzer
love this method.
Trying this out in a few minutes.  As a guy who has been single most of his life, I don't think it will take me the whole six minutes...
That was awesome!!!!
Thanks for that concise explanation and demo. I got given as a gift a 1 pound jar butter maker with two wooden balls in it to assist the ‘slam’ of the cream action. I have not used it yet but your tips have indeed inspired me! 👍🏻
No fun when you clock yourself on the chin while shaking like that. Lol. Least when i was a kid.
Love it, thanks. If I make honey butter, when do I add the honey... before shaking or after it's solid?
My butter was great THANKS 👍
I first watched this video at about 5 am PST on July 23rd, 2019.   By 2pm, same day, I had the heavy whipping cream and was selecting a mason jar from the pantry.    At roughly 2:45pm, I began to shake.   15 1/2 minutes later, I have both butter and buttermilk.   I’m shocked and a bit saddened that I was denied this experience as a child because of California’s desperate attempts of propagating Mexican culture and their ideologies at the complete expense of our American culture.   Seriously, we are comparing hand churned butter with refried beans paste.
Wow, I never knew it was that easy. Thank you so much!
🤨🤔🤤 guys it works form my 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 to yours thank you 🤗
Wow shes cute
Simple and easy. Just shake the piss out of it.
I whisk HWC in my KitchenAid and let it do the work. Don't forget that you can make fancier butters by adding different seasonings. I usually gift specialty butters or homemade jams for the holidays.
This was a great DIY butter recipe for the family cant wait to try with the kids. Thank you for sharing.
Great video.👍😊
How long does it stay good for?
Very cool!  Good to know.
This is great! Another fun activity to do with my grandkids when they visit... The treats I could make them using the butter are endless! Butter and honey biscuits come to mind first 😊 Thanks!
It must be butter because it’s on a roll!
We'll have to try it
Unfortunately most heavy creams today include some kind of gum as a stabilizer. Don't know who the idiot was at the FDA that decided to do this but I wish they would remove all gums
Love it, but I can't stand seeing someone put their hands in or on food, for some reason. I would use a wooden spoon or something instead of my hands.
I feel like I should buy a paint can at Home Depot, put the heavy cream in it, then have them shake it ... 🤔😉😂👊
I will definitely try this! Thanks!😊👏🏻
That’s so cool can’t wait to try it, and with the price of butter nowadays, It’s definitely worth doing. Question for you, can you can it and how long will it stay preserved? Thank you, New subscriber here now
Is this where the term Butterball comes from? How about taking it down to your local Sherwin-Williams and putting it in the paint Shaker? LOL
Thank you 👍 will try.
My Grandmother use to do this when I was growing up, we would take turns shaking the jar! great memories!❤️
So where does heavy cream come from?
very cool!
couple this with a simple homemade bread recipe and you'll be kicking it like great grandma used to.
That's just an awesome method to easily make butter! You're the best ! Subscribed!
That was the best science video eve4
Did y’all seriously never do this in elementary school?
Water us NOT necessary to get milk out if butter.
Sure not going to get much butter in a quart jar. Shake it, roll it, just move it.  We used gallon jars when I was a kid. Had to be careful not to break the jar
Great share! Beautiful!
I think I'll try this using a five gallon bucket and a paint shaker.  😀
Wow! That's so easy!
Ah Some  N AHSweet 💗 That technique also reminds Me of my Childrens ''' Childhood making that shaken cream butter at a Fieldtrip that had something to do with Pioneers  ) I didnt know that's buttermilk , and its already sour n or You just keep it long enough too get that sour to it ? I will have to try making a Chocolate Cake with Buttermilk . I def like it in pancakes ! I tried a tip a long time ago of putting mayonnaise in Chocolate Cake n it turned out really Good n ever since I always do it..... . More rich , dense n moist .   I wonder if this works for Vegan milks as I'm thinking it's really posh Gourmet N World  ) +💗🐄🐃🐑🐎🐵🐒🐯🐶🐆🦊🐹 🐘 🐰 🐽 🐔🐓 🕊 🦢🌸🍀🌷🌼🌲🦌😊💗🌌))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))
Lots of practice
Or 1hour n 35 min's rolling the Mason jar on the floor while rocking in your rocking chair and crotcheting
Wow! I love this. I am often plant based though and love my coconut cream. In fact I have a can of heavy coconut cream. Do you think it would work as well with the heavy coconut cream? My local grocery used to sell a coconut butter which was so good 😊 I'm so curious to try!! ❤
If you use light cream will it still make butter?
how much salt would you have added to cream for properly salted butter for someone with no issue with salt ?
In my class my teacher in forth grade we made a cowgirl and cowboy day and we made biter and it was the best butter I ever tried thanks so much now I can do it ❤️
You need to ripen your cream. Farm wives always left the cream out overnight in the churn to ripen. This gives the butter a much better flavor as well as letting it seperate much easier.
Buttermilk is fermented??
What's the shelf life? Does it have to be refrigerated?
Definitely going to try it! I never knew how easy it is to make butter..Thank you!
Since most creams come ultra pasteurized, does this make the process longer? Does it even work with ultra pasteurized? I know ultra pasteurized cream doesn’t work when making clotted cream, so unsure about this one. Thanks!
Trying this now. Been doing it for 10 minutes and all I have is thick liquid!! UPDATE: It took 1/2 an hour but it worked! 👍
I’ve been shaking mine for a bit and it’s still the same
How long does this butter keep? How long does the butter milk keep?
Why does this turn me on?
I love you. You’re amazing.
Just shake a jar to death
Can't think what, but am sure I must have done something wrong, although several people below had a similar experience.  Took me at least three times as long shaking vigorously, and it never got as solid as the video shows. My cream bottle said it was greater than 36% fat, so maybe not fat enough. @navioner below suggested waiting until the cream is room temp; perhaps that'll help next time. I added some salt and Italian herbs and it's like soft whipped butter and tastes great.
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
You did a great job explaining this! Thanks for taking the time to do so!
So is this 'buttermilk' like low -fat milk?
I've found that a cheap wide mouthed water bottle with the squeeze nozzle works great for this. Once your butter and buttermilk seperate, you can open the nozzle and gently squeeze the bottle and empty your buttermilk out into your container of choice.
She can shake that butter really good
this was delightful & delicious. thank you for sharing ! ❤️
ugh
I ended up over whipping so it's a very soft butter, but its butter!!!
How long is the butter good for?
i cannot wait to make this with my children! thank you for your video!
Very cool
too cool.  thanks
Wow! I can do this!
I’m about to have a field day with this and adding it to my steaks
I cook my pork chops and put buttermilk on top in the last 5 minutes then I make gravy out of that and wow not enough biscuits in the house
I wonder if it would work if I used to cusinart just stir it instead of shaking it
How long is it good for???
soooo cool!! Thank you.
I have a vague memory of doing this, but as a "kid's science experiment." I think the lesson in the book was about emulsions. They said to put some cream in a plastic bottle and shake away. The vagueness comes in because I think I tried to use my mom's half and half. No butter for me. But I'd probably try this for real now, since I know what whipping cream is now :P
Thank you thank you thank you
Sweet agree with about the Pioneers handme down recipes my granny taught me to make butter out the ground and buttermilk from the churn.
Wow!!! I can't wait to make this with my kids! Thank you so much for sharing!
WE MADE THIS AT OUR MINING FIELD TRIP
Here in Morocco we buy raw milk we put it on hit to kill bacteria then put it in the fridge so a skin forms on top and we collect them put them  in the freezer and later we shake it like  this to make homemade butter ....and it is so so good. Thanks for sharing your recepie 😻
So I just made a jar of honey butter... it’s satisfying when the cream breaks.
Do you add garlic, herbs or honey when shaking or when it's done?
Butter is just heavy cream? Mind. Blown. 🤯
About to start buying a lot of heavy cream because i love cooking with butter
I made my butter in a jar using half And half from whole milk and it turned out super creamy I couldn't even form it into a ball. What should I do different next time?
i just eat the cream straight out of the jar with a spoon.
How come I couldn't make it and then all of you could I feel lonely now
This is literally a 2 in 1 like your Getting a workout AND butter 🤗👍
Is regular "table salt" the ideal salt to add to the cream?
I learned this in my school today and it taste good
Thank you for the clear and concise instructions!
You have the prettiest face
How long will this keep in the fridge? Awesome video btw!👍😉
Thank you!!!
I have been making butter for 5 months and I don't buy store butter anymore  for food stores and I tastes  much better.😍🤗😄
How to make but in 2 min. Go to the store get some countrycrock and spread
And now search canabutter. All homemade !
Can you use heavy wiping cream
And another note, the Buttermilk she is talking about is sweet cream buttermilk, NOT the cultured stuff in the dairy case at the supermarket. It tastes just like cream but with the consistency of milk.
Do you have to refrigerate afterwards since making it from cream?
This is the most interesting I have watched in a while and I am definitely going to try it!!
Also, this is better than a shake weight, and it makes butter.
Wow I never knew how butter was made!
That's super cool! It helps to see what it looks like at each stage. I've tried this before, but gave up because I stopped too soon when I still had lumpy whipped cream instead of the glob of butter. I just tried again and success :)  Thank you for the video - now I'm off to check out the rest of your channel!
What kind of heavy cream
Whoa! Thanks for teaching me this baby!! I love butter almost as much as I love white women!
Thanks for the video!
My grandmother use to trick us kids in to shaking those Damon jars ,that's why my arms hurt today and I'm old
Oh my Fukin Gosh! AMAZING. I’m going to make this right now.......and to think I been buying this expensive ass butter at kroger🤦‍♀️. Thank you and just for this I’m a new subbie👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 Does it turn yellow too or do I need a dab of food coloring hun?
What happened to the butter milk? lol
That's so awesome and simple!!!
Tried to use your method earlier and oh my.. You lady must have some muscles on your arms! Good job! After the suggested time, mine just turned into a very very thick whipped cream. Arms were about to fall off so I completed it with a electric mixer to separate buttermilk from butter and then followed the rest of your instructions. We now have a lovely ball of homemade unsalted butter :) Apart from me being a weakling, it could be that English double cream is less fatty than US heavy cream so it probably needed some more shaking.
did not know this was possible. whats the calories and micro nutri.
If you’re going to go to the store and compare heavy cream for the highest fat content to make butter, and you’re already at the store…     JUST BUY BUTTER
That is amazing  I will try it soon.
This brought me back to my childhood . Great vid thanks
Awesome! Thank you so much! I will be doing this. Thank you!
took me a good 12 minutes lol. Dont give up! it will do exactly as she says!
So I could've been making my own butter all along? Wow. 😯
I had to do this for homework sksksksksk
I followed your exact instructions WHILE I was watching your video and for the first time in my life, I MADE homemade butter. lol Thank you so much for this video! I am just so excited and giddy. I was so skeptical until I actually made it. Thank you thank you. I think if my Mom and Gramma and Grampa were alive, I think they would be laughing but proud of me. <3
You're fab! I'll never run out of butter again brilliant
It works, but took about 20 minutes of constant shaking.
My grandma was raised in the 20s and used a butter churn ,she still has it and taught us girls how to use it
I’ll be doing this! Thank you!
Yours took about 8 minutes. I went through 5 pints of heavy cream, giving up after about 10 minutes of shaking for each pint, and no butter. Then with the 6th pint of heavy cream I decided to just keep shaking until I got butter. Well, 25 minutes later, yes, 25 agonizing minutes later, I finally got butter. I haven't made it since, trying to decide if it's worth all those minutes of shaking with the resulting sore arms. Nevertheless, the butter was delicious.
Super cute and Very practical! Eco nanny approved!🙋
Worked great! :D I had tried whipping it up in the Nutri Bullet, but it almost instantly became really thick cream , stuck to the sides and the blades no longer reached the cream. I YouTubed making butter, and your video came up! moved it all to a large jar, shook the daylights out of it and presto! beautiful butter!
To much shaking. Shake it for a bit then whisk with fork. Fast results!!
i dont know why that is so cool to me lol
Any idea how much buttermilk that rendered?
Lmao. Pioneer's used a butter churn. Not a mason jar.
I tried it. Got whipped cream. Gave up used a mixer got butter. Lol do not attempt unless you want to shake for like half an hr
Did this years ago and it worked perfectly.  The only change I made was to put the new ball of fresh butter onto a square of clean unbleached muslin, twisted the top and kept squeezing the twisted top to remove as much water as possible. then stored it in the refrigerator.
I just tried this and the end result was whipping cream. What did I do wrong?
Nice idea
"Buttermilk Chocolate Cake?!" My head exploded. I subbed and liked, thank you for sharing.
The best kind of butter
Great video.  Does it work better at room temperature
Out standing job well done Happy two see this wow I'm going to have to make sure that I make some thanks again for your information
This is dope!
I have wondered how to do this a long time! How can can you do this strait from the cows milk? Thanks!
Will whipping cream work ?
Super 👌👌👌
6 minutes?? It took me 20 straight minutes until it finally made butter.
i miss pioneer day when i was a kid. we use to make butter and buttermilk and then make home made buttermilk biscuits with fresh homemade butter on them.. loved it.
We did that in girl scouts when I was a kid.I'm 60 now and I  still remember it as fun and very tasty. We used baby food jars and I remember it as being very easy. I always wondered what you put into the jars. Glad I finally looked it up.Thanks. p.s.I saw that you told several people to add the salt at the end, do you mean after you remove it from the jar of when? Also how much salt do you add?      Thanks again
Ridiculously simple! Can’t wait to try this! Thanks for the video!
My mom always bought margarine.  I hated it.  Then one day in my third-grade class we made butter.  I was hooked!
Its good but it took me fucking 30 minutes
I just need butter for my popcorn
I bet if you added in plastic or wood balls to help agitate it you would seperate the milk fat faster
I'm on minute 14 and still don't have butter. What I do have is cramps
Oh wow in the west this is a heratiage lol in the south the slaves did this 🙄 guess that's my heratiage
You're such a sweet gal and very sexy too!😉
I just love the simplicity of butter making why did i not search this years ago lol
Where do you buy 38% fat heavy cream?
I was wondering if it should be room temperature or cold right from the fridge for the heavy whipping cream?  I did try to make it, but after around 8 minutes over all, I did not get much separation from the butter and butter milk.
DOES NOT WORK. Followed the directions exactly, shook for ten minutes, had nothing but salty whipped cream. Thanks for nothing.
Whats the shelf life of this? Is it like regular store butter?
it came out "Fantastic!" t-y again.
Looks so good
are you racist
Its that easy to make butter lol? Jesus thats awesome
We must have done something wrong ours would not separate we ended up with whipped  butter. It tasted like butter just not firm.
How do you store this and how long is it good for?
Love it. I find all the butter in stores are mixed with all food poisoned. I will do this every 2-3day to get fresh butter, And no chemical. Thank you.
I tried this. It works so well
Thank you! I made butter this morning. First time ever.  Seems to take forever once it becomes shipped cream.  But once it breaks into butter and buttermilk it is very obvious.
I used the same sized jar and same quantity of heavy cream. It took 6 minutes to be whipped cream. 14 minutes for the whipped cream to separate and 16 for it to be butter. Be prepared for lots of shaking.
3:12 for those 'special' brownies
i love your style
That's WAY better than any shake weight! 👍😉😁🤣
I think I shook too long after the ball and then went back o up cream. Idk
O M G!  I did it!!!  Best butter ever!!!  Thank you!
Made this recipe with my Cub scouts using the pint sized wide mouth Mason jars, they were thrilled to see how easy it was to make. Using the wide mouth jars made it easier to get the butter out of the jars.
Thank you sooooooooo very much!
Thanks for the help Suzy my cousin really needed the help📩
I just did it this morning! Super fun and easy to make. It only took me 10 minutes from to finish, I only had a half of pint of heavy cream. Will definitely do this again!
I never knew it was this simple...awesome vid!
Fascinating. I would watch her change tires on her car though too.  Nice lady.
I look forward to doing this , I have a special needs child and making every thing I can . God bless you
Loved your butter making technic. Do you have a technic to convert your home made butter to Ghee or Purified butter too? If you do, please share it.
Amazing how simple it is to make.
Just wondering when do I add honey to it I want to make honey butter
Could I use coconut milk rather than heavy cream?
Wow so simple, Thank you!
About 2-3 minutes in a food processor.
You're so cute and perfect idea
Can you make Ghee with this recipe?
I would like to see the whole recipe of Homemade Butter Beer instead of a line here and a line there.  Can that be arranged....If not, don't show it.
Cow fat
So to get “raw” butter do I need to use raw cream? Is this considered pasteurized if the cream you use is pasteurized? Probably huh
Great video,, Informative.. Cool..
I love your videos the stay at home chef thankyou for your help me to do it right way thankyou very much give a high five
Very nice.... U are soo cute mam..
Thank you so much for sharing this! After i saw your video i was intrigued so i had to try it right away and OMG, it is so easy to make it! Apart from being an fun arm workout 🤣 it is also so satisfying to make it yourself! It taste fresh and delicious, i will hardly buy butter at the supermarket again.😍
PRO TIP ;)) Do NOT put a marble in the jar to help agitate unless you want a butter bath when the bottom of the jar pops !!
Wow
cant wait to try this!
Great!! I tried this with double cream but there was no liquid at all. Secondly, when I gave the solid cold water bath, it started to fall apart. Any idea what could be the reason for this. Having said all of this, whatever the outcome was, we enjoyed it😊. TIA
I just tried this and it was easy.  After about seven minutes using roughly 4 oz of heavy cream I had a round ball of butter about twice the size of a golf ball.  I added about a 1/4 thimble full of fine ground salt before shaking.  Most of the salt flavor seemed to end up in the buttermilk (which didn't really taste good).  The butter is pretty good.  Thanks.
Much better than a shakeweight!
Great video. Thanks for the awesome diy on butter.
Try putting a glass marble in the jar while shaking. It helps
I just did this. My kids thought it was cool.
I am a new subscriber. And I simply adore your videos. Very easy to follow.
ty
Quick tip, if you let the cream reach room temperature it will help with the separation. It takes me 3 minutes to make.
That is so cool! I am going to try it!
Butter is so delicious 😍 , thank you for this fun activity 😊
I can't believe matter butter is this easy, I thought it was going to be like one of those broom sticks in a huge jug and back and forth but this looks super easy and fun!
👍👍💗💗
great ...👍👍👍
Thanks for sharing :)
going to try this. So cool
oh wow!!!
I'm going to use a paint mixer at the auto body shop to shake up the butter lol
I am definitely going to try this.  You have inspired me.  To have butter and buttermilk awesome!
Never knew this! Thanks for sharing!
This. is. AWESOME. I can't wait to try this!
You can whip the cream into butter, instead of all that shaking and just transfer it over into a jar. But great video nonetheless.
Cool beans honey. I can't shake a jar that long though,🎈
WoW...I'm a city girl & who knew? NO more store bought  "butter" 4 me! GR8 vid!!!
