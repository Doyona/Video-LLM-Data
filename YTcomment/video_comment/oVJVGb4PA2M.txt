She was awesome since the start! Well done Alexandra 😊
Loved this space and how you did it on a small budget.
Love this lady. So cute and clever.
Chataline was NUTS to lose you Alexandra!!!  Sooooo short sighted but i LOVE your own channel!  You go girl!
Brilliant idea!!  Do you have any video on how to turn an under the deck area livable. Specially if is just dirt.  Love to see something like that.  Thank you
Wow that's super cute! If you want a cheaper way, go to flea markets and thrift stores. I always find super cute furniture and other things for like nothing $$.
Good
Very Nice channel...pls see my cultivation program.. thx  https://youtu.be/XztlKNb8Ax0
Can you give me some ideas for my Patio??🙏🙏🙏
Tudah Rbah (thank you very much) for helping people live in comfortable, awesome environments.  When the Messiah was Crucified, the Father split the curtain in the Temple, thus resigning the Temple as the place where He would place His Spirit.  He will allow us to be filled with His Righteous Spirit, if we ask.  His Righteous Spirit, is called in ancient Hebrew, the RYH HaQDSH (Spirit, the Righteous).  So now our temple/ body can be filled with the RYH HaQDSH.  But first one must ask His Son to be our Savior.  The Atoning Offering, for the world, for the remission of sin, is the Messiah (1 John 2:1-2), slain on PSHh/Pesach, and rose on First Fruits.  He told Myriam (not his mom, but another), not to detain Him, as He had to present Himself to the Father.  The Messiah also came in Book of Yahushua, as the Captain of Yah's Army.  He also came (Book of BRASHYT/Genesis) as MLK TSDQ, to Whom ABRaHM tithed.  The 2nd witness of this is when the Pharisees were arguing with the Messiah and the Messiah said ABRaHM saw His day and was glad.  They said, You are not yet fifty, how could ABRaHM have seen Your day.  The Messiah said, PHNY ABRaHM, ANY (before ABRaHM, I).  (You had a couple, 3-years ago, videos on yoga.  Yoga is from Hinduism, and it is a religious practice, letting demons in the temple of the person doing it.  Stay away from the abomination of yoga and tell others likewise to be saved by the Messiah and do not do yoga. ) Ask the Messiah to be your personal Savior.  He is the Light, the Truth and the Way.  He is the only way to Everlasting Life.

ummmmmm what happens when it rains.....and everything gets wet XD
Sorry, my condo association would not allow this. Neither would any apartment rental I've lived in.
Personally I would have added more seating.
That’s just gorgeous!
Are you still around? No vids for a while.
I didn’t even know they made hooks for vinyl siding! This just changed the game. Thank you!
I love you but you GOTTA buy some new music for your videos...
what happened to this channel? =(
Hi Girl, just wanted to tell you that you inspired me to create these kind of videos on my channel too.  Love the beauty and idea of this. You're a beautiful and inspiring soul and I hope the best happens for you.   https://youtu.be/SmqIiBcXd4g
Too many dark colors
it looks unfinished.
Absolutely love this ...great inspiration
Wish I could find someone like you in my area Denver. I absolutely love what you do
love it more home primp!!
You are amazing, Alexandria
👍👍
I always wonder with patios: what if it rains?
shes very talented !!!
Girl you did good!!’😊
What about proper chairs and a table?!
Ok , but once again "on a budget" is not 300 for a bench and an ambiante light I mean that's absurd plus if we use items we already own 300 is not budget friendly at all...
The kids area seems like an after thought. There's no where to that chalk. It's just sitting on the ground in the way.
Nice!
Sooooooo two people can sit down? Because you would have to be really comfortable with someone to sit shoved up against them like that on top of a chest.
Amazing ideas!
“ if you have indoor plants bring them inside” they are called indoor plants for a reason. maybe get outdoor plants if you want outdoor plants.
I really love the videos in this channel. .when are you gonna upload again? It's been a long time
I would love too see a primp on an apartment balcony space! Great video
it should also work for small corner indoor. i like the light and black board idea!
can these lights stand the rain?
Great!!!!!
You should do a dorm/college apartment makeover next!
i don't think "modern" is the right word
Why no more new video? ?
I would love to see the reactions of the owners after the makeover.
Love your videos!! I wish I had your talent for decorating :) no matter how many videos I watch I cant figure out how to apply it to my space haha.... random question - what font do you use for your “home primp” intro??
when can we see new episodes :(  Wife and me like this so much
That’s a super space
Loving this series! I am the mother of a ten year old and twelve year old and I’m needing to refresh their room and transition to teenage status soon. Would love to see teen, tween makeovers for boys and girls. Keep up the amazing transformations!
Do a dorm room home primp!
Hello Hello. Can you do a rent house ? Makeover rent kitchen, living room, bedroom.... thank you 😊
Hi  You r genius
not alot of seeting area...
This was cute..Folded chairs would have been good out there, or a small serving table  or a outdoor kitchen set up so many great ideas can been done in that space, loved the lights & contrasting wall, I would love to see you do something for someone from thrift stores & consiment shops.. I'm not sure if you've done this already, I'm new to your channel..
Genius
Your video are good..but pls change your music
so many people complain about the logistics of this series ("using things you already own isn't fair" you too can do this though...as do many other diy series; "why did you splurg on X and not Y"/general critiques about the budget, which are fair at times but also - this a lil bougie magazine where most of the houses redecorated are in the downtown area of a major city, clearly their concept of budget is a little different) but continue to watch multiple videos in it anyway? you wanna critique questionable things, sure fine but critiquing this as if it's the only "low" budget home decor videos/ there aren't a plethora of other affordable diy/home decor youtubes is annoying. youtube has passed the days of being aimed at being accessible/tutorial-like. now this is just a 5 minutes hgtv episode and that's fine. this seems to be more so for inspiration than imitation anyway
Please do a small kitchen makeover💙💙(hit like if you agree)
Alex you need to make your own interior youtube channel x
Hey Alexandra I'll be attending college soon and I need small dorm room decor ideas. You should do a video !
what if it rains...
Shame you insisted on using plastic straws in your drinks and putting them in the bar cart.
Also maybe do a guest bed room / office space?  I need ideas for how to do mine lol.
Hmm now I wanna check with my building if I can paint my balcony this dark grey colour. I love it
I like these videos but I still feel compelled to write negative comments.
An apartment balcony!   More mix style and less arts and crafts!!   And feel a bathroom or kitchen are often. Overlooked to design.
that seems like very little for 300 bucks!
I love these videos I was hooked since I saw the first one a few weeks back
More small apartment makeovers! 😍
really love this! more videos pleaseee :) maybe kitchen ideas?
Please make more home primps!! Girl, you’re amazing!! I would love to see like a dining area, craft room or pet corner!!
What happens when it rains i aleays wonder that about redoong porch or outside videos u have all these nice cushions and rugs and loghts and paint but what hsplens ehrn it rains it will be ruined obviously when it gets wet it will dry but ehrn it dries it wikl be all gross☹
Love every of your episodes!
Primp a dorm room!
That painted brick wall adds so much dimension to the space! Also I'm in love with those little planters from ikea, that's such an amazing products for a small space!
woohoo! finally a home primp video, i'm in love with this series, thank you for share #Alexandra
Kitchen/dining room, please!  ♡
More episodes please
Living/dining space plssss
I NEED home print every day
LOOOVEEED THISSS!!!! YAAASS 💖💖💖💖💖💖😁😁😁
This is my favorite series! I binge watched the playlist and can’t wait for more episode to come out!
The only thing that I hate about your videos is that you always use the same music!!!
WHERE IS THE POMPON BASKET?!
Hiii! I discovered your videos a few days ago and im OBSESSED with every single one of them!! Can you pleaseeee do a rental bedroom and/or living room decor/transformation so that we don’t have to splurge on something that is going to be temporary? Because my sister, my cousin, and i are going to be attending university and already got our 2 bedroom rental apartment :) Thank youu so muchh <3
more home primp please!!
What I don't get is your videos always promise a low budget but then you're constantly adding items you already have. Seems misleading.
i always like the way put it to make any set up beautiful, simple and to the mark with amazing and less expensive items. The makeover arrangements make anything that you decide upon real self-relieving.
First !
