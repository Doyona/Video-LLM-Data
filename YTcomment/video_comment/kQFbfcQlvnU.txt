It warms my heart to see you do such a midwestern thing!! I don’t know if they do it other places… I’ve been told it’s Midwestern. I was always stirred with a bowl of melted cheese on the side. Some people would put the cheese in their chili, but a lot of people would also dip their cinnamon roll in the cheese.
Kansan here, we love it
I have mixed feelings here. I hate the idea of chicken and waffles.  Sweet and savory doesn’t often work for me.  However cinnamon goes so very well with cumin & chili powder.  I’d dig into this enthusiastically.
I always butter my dough before putting cinnamon sugar....this is different
How you list all states but Nebraska where it's prominent LOL
Chili is eaten in the southern USA too and they also have all beef chili too
I always eat peanut butter and butter sandwiches with chili that should have beans. Either rip it into parts or just do the dunk. Now I'm curious about cinnamon rolls though 🤔
Crushed corn chips can substitute for masa (I mean, they’re made of masa after all)
She forgot Wyoming even existed... It proves that it doesn't
In the school lunch it sounds like the cinnamon roll is meant to be dessert
The stoner in me just did the *"Cabbage Patch..."*
I use that same box mix! I add in red kidney beans though and omit that flour.
I've lived on Oregon my entire life and I've never heard of nor seen this combination before.  Never seen it as a School lunch. Never seen it in a Cafe or Restaurant, not even as a friends family dinner.  This is all new to me and I might try it sometime.
Between Emmy and Lisa I love there videos make you feel so welcome.comforting
This is definitely a common staple in the Midwest
Oh my God I love Miss Florence❤❤❤🙏🏾🕊
She missed Washington 🥲
The amount of cayenne pepper you put on that chilli, Emmy.... It's impressive and terrifying.
Personally when I make cinnamon rolls “not being excessive” isn’t ever on my list for what I strive to achieve.  >.<
She's smart, she's cute, she likes food and cars (and has impeccable taste in both, might I add), she's completely unfazed by the sloppy brown nonsense that is Cincinnati chili...honestly, I'm just super happy there's someone like Emmy in the world.  Though, the beans give me pause, arguably even more than the cinnamon roll...ah, well. Nobody's perfect.
I Ike spicy foods but when you put in so much cayenne or Tabasco you can’t taste anything out that.  It’s like people who put a lot of garlic in dishes.  All koi taste is the garlic.  Why don’t you just eat the cayenne on its own?
We had this for school lunch in Nebraska.  The supermarket bakeries around here make cinnamon roll bread bowls that you can serve chili in.
She completely missed Wyoming.
I lived in Iowa when this was posted, NEVER heard of this. In fact no major chili influence in Iowa. I don’t like chili so it would have been on my radar!
A sweet chili hotdog minus the weenie
Emmy, if you ever get the chance, you need to try chili with biscuits and gravy. The chili goes right on top of the biscuits and gravy. It's a southern thang 🤣🤣🤣🤣 but I love it!
We live in Indianapolis, which is indeed in the midwest. If we do not have cinnamon rolls when we make chili, no one in the house will eat the chili 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
In Latin America we sometimes dip beef empanadas in sugar and it tastes amazing. It really accentuates the flavours
That chili oooooo, and them cinnamon rolls look scrumptious! 😱🤤😋👌🏽✌🏽💙
You want to know a gross combination.... Wendy's 'taco' salad made with chili... 🤮🤢🤮
I like my dough like I like my men - smooth, hot and sticky.
In West Central Illinois, we would eat peanut butter sandwiches with our chili. As a kid, chili day at the school cafeteria always included a half peanut butter sandwich which, of course, we’d dunk in our chili. Keep in mind that midwest chili generally is a bit soupy and often includes a bit of brown sugar and cinnamon, so dunking was a no brainer. Obviously it sounds odd to folks who didn’t grow up eating this combo, but peanut butter isn’t particularly sweet and the same individuals I’ve seen frown on it will eat shrimp/pork spring rolls dipped in peanut sauce or peanut butter hamburgers without a second thought. Regarding cinnamon rolls, it was weird to me when I first became aware of the combo but not so much due to the flavors, but more in that it was combining what is mostly seen as a breakfast pastry w/ the lunch/dinner staple of meat/bean chili ✌🏼
If you're ever in ohio and see a Skyline Chilli place, stop in and get a chilli dog. Thet put cinnamon in theirs
The unable record thermodynamically tickle because rule naively overflow during a mindless north korea. grandiose, kindly museum
I'm not too confused by this because yeah we usually eat a sweet corn bread with chili, so why not?
When I was young, I'd eat a bowl of chili with peanut butter on toast. <3
as mentioned below, honey cornbread and chili is often eaten together.  a cinnamon roll is just another sweet bread, and cinnamon's a lot of people's "secret ingredient" to their chili tejano.  i can see how this'd work.  i'm thinking i'll cut the rolls rather thin and place them in a pie pan, once baked, top with your chili and cheese.  return to the oven until cheese is melted, and i'm guessing the cinnaroll chili pie'll be a hit at your next potluck.
I grew up in Kansas. This was a normal school lunch. The rolls were kept in a warmer and by the time you got your lunch the rolls were so dried out and hard the only way you could eat it was by dipping it in the chilli
this reminds me of cincinnati chili!!! which actually has cinnamon and sugar in the chili itself. and the starch is spaghetti!!!! i love regional chilis everyone makes em so different
Yes!!! Whenever I talk to my friends about this where I live now they have no idea what I’m talking about! We use to have Chili and Cinnamon Rolls on a Friday once or twice a month when I was growing up in Montana. I sometimes have a craving for the combo in the winter.
WHY???????????????
We always have peanutbutter sandwiches with our chili
A sack of dehydrated chili eaten in the same bowl with one of those gas station sticky breakfast rolls was a backpacking staple. It's delicious.
Emmy's pure joy at the smiley face made me way too happy
This is a common combo in Kansas, however my family usually has chilly for dinner and cinnamon rolls for dessert.
In Nebraska we always had cinnamon rolls with our chili in our public school lunches
Eat the ducky moss 👀
OK! I Promise! Il definitely try this, next time I prep up a chili batch!
Hey I was named after that car 😋
Growing up our “family car” was 500 GT Shelby Cobra. Never tried his chili.
Not my type of cinnamon roll, but whatever floats your boat.
I've ate Ohio style chilli it is horrible
Looks disgusting 😷
Enjoyed very much!
Emmy, there is no one in colorado who eats this. This is weird to two people who have lived in colorado their whole lives. Lololol, don't tie us to this weirdness.
Skyline chili (Cincinnati chili) is made with cinnamon and cocoa and it's the best thing ever 💕
Emmy, j love you, but your curiosity has me worrying about you hon
A friend of mine told me about this combination. I had never heard of it before.  It works! I'm used to chili with a peanut butter sandwich on the side.
My school used to have chili day , they had chili, nachos, and cinnamon rolls. I dipped everything in my chili, because that chili was like 1000 degrees. So dipping everything in it was the only way to eat it. If not the bell would ring before the chili cooled off.
Omg i commented on one of your videos suggesting this just a few days ago. I didnt know you already made a video about it. This is one of my favorites!
This is the favorite meal of many kids at our school in Kansas.
Smiley face, so great!!!
I like fritos in my chili
What the hell kind of inbred, Tuesday night dinner is that? I'll try it.
All cinnamon rolls should arrive smiling :) love this video!
All cinnamon rolls should arrive smiling :) love this video!
I'm in Iowa and I've seen this combo, but have yet to try it. Sounds weird, but now I guess we'll have to try it and see!😁
I can picture you in a Shelby Cobra GT 500. (See Gun Smith Cats).     Having just checked, you have the Rally Vincent hairstyle.  Awesome!
I saw the title and went "That's an odd combination," but as soon as you mentioned lunchrooms it all came rushing back! I went to middle & high school I'm rural Colorado in the 1980s, and "Chili and cinnamon rolls" was the only lunch menu item that was listed that way on the schedule instead of just by the entree. It was everyone's favorite day. .My recollection is that the chili was nothing to write home about, but we all *lived* for those big ol' sticky cinnamon rolls. Thanks for the unexpected nostalgia!
when iowa gets name dropped but nebraska doesn't 😔
I've lived in Oregon my whole life and never heard of this combination before now. Honey cornbread and chili, sure. Cinnamon roll and cornbread? Someone else can have that. :)
Was this something I ate on the daily?  No.  Was it frequent in grade school?  Yes.  Did I dip my roll in the chili?  Hell no.
My chili is only beans no meat
Hwite Hwole Hweat    Stevie would be proud.
I'm from Colorado, my fondest school lunch memories were of cinnamon rolls and chili!!
Skyline Chili in Columbus, Ohio, puts cinnamon in their special chili recipe so this might not be too bad.....maybe, 😂😂😂😂😂😂
The cinnamon rolls didn't need to proof a second time after you rolled and cut them out and put them on the pan?
Only doe you Emmie, will Iwatch a one minute ad on Restasis
Since I'm younger than Emmy I will most likely live to the announcement on the channel on when she dies or when the channel suddenly stops or YouTube dies
my favorite school lunch in South Dakota, and my grandma would often make chili for dinner if she she made cinnamon rolls for breakfast/book club with her friends and we would eat the leftover rolls with dinner. yummy. 🥰  BUT WHERES THE BUTTA!? 😟
Emmy's reaction to the accidental smiley face was pure gold.
My grandma used to serve cinnamon rolls and chilli! Such a lovely, rich combo. We are from PNW. Had it at school too.
Chili+snowy weather= relaxing lovely and cuddling day🤗
I'm from Missouri. This is definitely a thing.
I wish she had made a midwest style chili to go with it. It makes the combination even better.
The music you use makes me sooo happy. It takes me back to my childhood when I'd watch Curious George on rainy days. Lots of love from Colorado!! <3
We eat this EVERYWHERE in Nebraska.
It's grrrreat! Emmy the Tiger.
On that 70's show kitty made it for breakfast when red's mother passed away lol. Looked good😊👍
As an Iowan, I was raised on chili with a peanut butter sandwich to dip. Delicious!
This is an amazing combination, plus I always add cinnamon to my homemade chilli con carne. Funny but it tastes so much better with it added. I start by slow cooking my onions in all the spices for about 30 minutes before gradually adding all my other ingredients. It helps to layer the flavours. I’ve cooked this for over a hundred teenage sea cadets and staff, here in the UK. They went nuts for it!!❤️
I see some little helping hands occasionally 🙂
6:19 what does that look like to you?
cinnamon and chili is a classic combo. If you don't have the cinnamon bun, just add cinnamon to chili.
My Ma likes to add a big spoonful of mashed pumpkin to chili. You can't taste it, but it adds something. XD
Emmy is the modern day Julia Child
I'm from Colorado and never heard of this pair!
Cook your children
We had this in our school cafeteria!  Our Wendy’s fast food restaurant also serves this combo.
I did not know that this was strange?  I thought everyone did it.  I make this at least one a month; you cannot do this with canned chilli...well, you can, but it doesn't taste great. I make my out an chilli. It's not really a "recipe"? It's more of a just grabbing all my ingredients and putting it all in until it looks right. I loooooovvve this meal.
I went to elementary school in Washington, and we were served chilly and maple bars!
You're just making stuff up now. No way this is an actual recipe. What is wrong with people? It sounds horrid.
Try Cincinnati Chili...
It's definitely not just a northern thing. I'm from Arkansas, and have always seen this all over the south. They just go perfectly together, the perfect comfort meal.
How does your family stay away when you cook?
6:20 That one is your boob? 😉
Oh my that cayenne!!! :-o
My mom loves peanut butter and pancake syrup sandwiches with chili. She eats it as a side, not together. I've eaten it before. Not my favorite, but not bad.
I bet a keto version of this would be stellar!!
As an Oregonian, I assure you I've never heard of this.
The absolute best thing to eat with chili is a peanut butter sandwich. And I make my chili with a tablespoon of cinnamon and a quarter cup (or more, have to taste it as you go) of dark unsweetened cocoa. It makes it super rich and meaty flavored. Also a quick fix to thicken it would be to crush up about a cup of round, bite size tortilla chips until they are crumbs. Thickens it right up.
No no emmmyyyyyy. Gotta make real homemade chili. It's simple and easy. No weird ingredients. Just your beef or deer, chili beans w/ juice, kidney beans no juice, 3 cans Rotel no juice, can o tomato sauce and add chili powder to taste ( I make a big pot so I use a whole container of it and toss  some red pepper flakes in) and cook for a couple of hours on low. I've made it that way for 20 years and everyone says it's the best they've had.
I was wondering have you heard that there is chocolate chili I kid you not chili with chocolate in it and I was wondering if you could look up a recipe and see if it can be made just curious thanks
No. Nope. Not even.
And I thought chili with a pb sandwich was weird! Lol You should make frijoles charros or drunk cowboy soup. It's kinda like chili  but Mexican,  inexpensive and often served at large outdoor parties where I live. There are many variations and I am curious to see what spin you would give it. Usually it's made with a cheap meat like baloney my mom uses hotdogs
I always remember our school cafeteria had cinnamon rolls with their chili (rural MT)!  We never had the combo at home though - I honestly never even thought about them as a pairing until this video got me thinking about them getting served together!  (We ate them separately, chili for lunch, cinnamon roll for the little school lunch dessert)
It was served for school lunch when we had real food and ladies who could cook where I grew up. It was Bean Chowder and the Cinnamon Rolls was dessert not mixed together but y'all do your thing.
Yes! Cinnamon rolls and chili go together so perfectly!!
I moved to South Dakota about 9 years ago. I have worked in 3 different districts since then. All 3 districts served cinnamon rolls with chili. 😊
My friend throws a chili eating & pumpkin carving party every fall and she always makes cinnamon rolls for dessert.
Lived in ND for over 30 years. NEVER heard of this. Just put a large scoop of rice on a plate then add chili
I gotta try that!
Here’s a lil tip for bigger, puffer, fluffier cinnamon rolls, after cutting the buns and placing on a tray, allow them to proof for a couple hours. When they are fully proofed you can bake them
This was something we had at the school cafeteria, the cinnamon roll was what made that awful chili palatable. I haven't had this combo for years. I was told by someone from Iowa that it's a Dutch-American invention.
I've never heard of this combination and I was surprised to see that it's actually good. Now I wanna try it
Lions and tigers and bears oh my! The calories must be so high!
Classic  fisherman and hunter's breakfast.  You put this together when your wife won't get up early to fix breakfast.  It is also used at cabin and there is no one that wants or can cook. You have leftover canned chili from supper and all that was brought for breakfast was coffee and cinnamon rolls.  The shredded cheese being there by accident or someone is from Wisconsin.
We used to have a restaurant in upstate NY that served a mini cinnamon loaf with each dinner. It went well with everything!  I always got chicken picatta and it was delicious with that!  My friend ate it with filet minion.
In Kansas, cinnamon rolls and chili are very common. I never liked it.
I like my chili with pumpernickel.
I love that chili mix! I like mine with beans because it's a cheap way to increase the yield, but I totally get wanting to skip on them.
Chili makes everything better. I feel like my breakfast was similarish; Leftover crockpot chili burrito with cinnamon raisin bread, 'not too far off. Mid-Westerners/West Coasters in particular put chili in/on everything, hell I want to put it on a baked potato later. The farther east you go, Frito chili pies become more rare & it's a damn Frito recipe, how so rare, I know Fritos exist in the East... but ya-know, partial & all.
Cayenne... I used to love heat. Now my insides can't handle it anymore😣😭
Nope. Try a roasted onion. Just take a big onion and oven roast. Eat with salted butter. It's pretty tasty.
I always use cinnamon in my chili but I never thought to try it with an actual cinnamon roll 🤔
8:08 emmy has battle scars!
This was my favorite school lunch as kid in Kansas. I never mixed it but some people do dip their roll into the chili. Chili should never have beans though. Team no beans.
i know i'm late commenting on this. Growing up in Kansas, our lunch ladies served this once a month. It's a classic.
Grew up in KS AND chili/cinnamon roll days were THE. BEST at school!!
cinnamon goes perfect with red chili. I've never tried cinnamon rolls but have been adding cinnamon to chili since I was a kid
This sort if reminds me of a current fad here in Texas, which is a cheeseburger that uses two glazed doughnuts instead of the hamburger bun. I haven't tried it yet. Lol
All cinnamon rolls should arrive smiling  :)
Wednesday elementary school lunch.  Best day of the week!
Wut Does Emmy say b4 she taste something  ?
This was huge at school in western Nebraska, you tear off pieces of the cinnamon roll and dip them into the chili, OH SO GOOD!❤️. Thank you for bringing this to everyone else’s attention!
Enjoyed
If you like cinnamon in your chili I think you would love this I myself don't
Good tip on the cinnamon roll flour but I prefer no oil in dough, with milk but buttered under cinnamon sugar application. Also, as per a crockpot recipie book circa 1979, you may add a variety of fresh chopped veg, home spice mix and less beef which is more tasty and certainly more healthy than heavy beef & packaged spice packet version.
Shout out from the northern plains. Cinnamon rolls and chili is the only way to make it through frigid Dakota/Minnesota winters. This was served up probably once a week for lunch in school.  The cinnamon rolls I make and that seem pretty widespread here are quite different. The schmear between layers always has butter, you let them rise after rolling into rolls, and cook them snuggled in together so only the outside ones have the hard sides (I prefer middle ones!!!!). Usually the icing has cream cheese in it when I make them. Amazing combo!
Awe....you made me laugh with the smiling cinnamon roll, you are too cute!!!🐶🤗👍💗
I watch your videos every day they are my favorite!! I wanna see pictures of your boys!
Ate this in elementary school still ear it today grew up in KY
I honestly can't see this being that bad? My family uses an old cowboy chili recipe with cocoa powder, black coffee and stout in it, so I can definitely see the sweet bread pairing well and being gooey and nice.
I’ve never heard of this combination.  I might be tempted to put icing on my chili 🤣
Kansas school lunches!
I’ve lived in the PNW, the west, and the South and have NEVER heard of this haha
I’ve lived in the PNW, the west, and the South and have NEVER heard of this haha
I like to make my chili with cinnamon and brown sugar! I prefer the sweet with the heat and savory!
Loved the video, especially your tasting commentary!
I live in ne and we eat cinnamon rolls with chili
i always thought this was just an 80’s trend. i remember having it a lot in elementary school and haven’t seen it since.
Now, what you do is make a grilled cheese in a panini press or waffle iron with the cinnamon rolls and a good melting cheese. Goes wonderfully with your chili.
This one has a smiley face!    Now I know why you liked Bao!!
Yep grew up with this in KS. Still make them together all the time.
I live in Kansas and I never knew that everyone didn’t eat cinnamon rolls with their chili until recently. All my schools served it for lunch growing up.
Mmm....chews...(looks at cinnamon roll)...chews....mmmm. 😂😂😂
Nebraska native here. Can't have Chili without homemade Cinnamon rolls. Don't knock it til ya try it!❤
That's just wrong
Interesting. I wonder why I haven't heard of this if it's popular in North Dakota as you say.
LOL@smiley face cinnamon roll!
DELISH! I love it! BTW Emmy, the Shelby Cobra is my dream car! You’re AWESOME!
If you are nuts to the cinnamon roll and eat it with the chilli it adds a fantastic dimension to the taste
All cinnamon rolls should arrive smiling. :)
Emmy always butter things of this nature 🙏
You must be related to Tony the Tiger. It's GRRRRRRREAT!!
This is a Nebraska thing. You can get it at the Runza Huts, which are a local fast food chain. Ask me about runzas, which are also a Nebraska thing.
Nobody In Oregon eats this. I’d try it though.
When I lived in northern Oregon, this combo was sssoooooo on the menu in diners;- I never tried the combo together..., apparently I was missin’ out... LOL!!! Now that I’m living back in California, I’ve talked to people about this and they will look at me like I am crazy!! LOL!!!  But lots of combinations that don’t really make sense are consumed by many people and are classic treats to the tastebuds;- for a few examples,- apple 🍎 🍏 sauce and pork chops, or apple 🍎 🍏 pie and (Sharp) cheddar cheese..., (again) just to name a couple combinations but there are several out there besides these two classic combos. Anyway, I just wanted to share love the videos I think they’re awesome and loved the cinnamon van with the smiling face!! This can only mean that you make happy food that makes people happy!!! Keep up the awesome work!!! 😊☀️👍
This how you know your on that good shit (weed) to eat something like this
How do you stay so thin???
I’m here for this combo!!!! Sounds DELISH
I cringed when the salt was added directly to the yeast 🤭
This is a weird but good combo!
I think Emmy must be an exceptional cook.
I'd totally try this combo. Two of my favorite things together? Heck yeah
We serve chili with beans sometimes here in Texas, we just serve the beans on the side.
Why she say whole wheat like that😭😭💀
The other idea I had I've heard of this I don't know if you've heard of it chocolate chili
You know what would be interesting if someone can do a vegan chili with the cinnamon bun I'd like a cinnamon bun that's like a vegan style that would be interesting
Being a Californian I CANT IMAGINE getting a bowl of chili and a cinnamon roll for lunch or even breakfast!! Forget eating them together, I wouldn’t be able to eat those two in one sitting without getting a tummy ache after!
Theres no butter on it? My gma makes rolls every Christmas and she uses like a stick of butter per batch and then puts cinnamon sugar over it before rolling
From the Midwest and never heard of This!!.....
I've never had this but we always ate ours with peanut butter and honey sandwiches!!
I've lived in South Dakota my entire life and have never heard of this concoction.
My mom is making this today😄😄😄
I never heard about this until Chelsea from Teen Mom 2 tweeted about it a couple months ago.
I was born and raised in Arkansas and where I went to school chilli and cinnamon rolls for a big thing I've always loved it
looks good.
Kansas cusine at its finest
When I was a little boy in elementary school in 1973 we would get hot lunches served by the school. Every Thursday we got Chili and a giant Cinnamon Roll for lunch. I used to dunk pieces of my Cinnamon Roll in my Chili. It tasted great! Pretty soon I had the rest of my classmates copying me. I started a new Trend that swept across the Nation for decades to come!
Instead of using water for your chili, use 2 cans of beef broth. Also, to kick it up a bit add smoked paprika and chipotle pepper... Let me know if you try this! Its my kids fave! Happy cooking!!!
As soon as I saw the thumbnail i was sold! I want to try this!
I have never had cinnamon rolls with my chili but it makes sense. I am from the South and when I make chili I like a pan of Jiffy Cornbread to go with it. The sweetness of the cornbread and the spicy chili are an awesome combination.
Hmmm....I'm curious. And I like peanut butter sandwiches w my chili. My dad did it. The creaminess of the butter w the spicy of the chili.
as someone from the midwest I have never heard of this and have never seen anyone eat this...🤔
I'm normally a mad person this woman actually put a smile on my face
Oh no. I think you forgot the butter? Well, I should say I use butter with the cinnamon sugar.
I used Mrs Dash chili seasoning last time I made chili, it was amazing
My husband may have ground the flour you're using. 😁
9:31 my gosh could you be any more adorable? 😂😍
I feel like she’ll eat anything at all and says it’s good
You know something’s good when Emmy’s inner Tony the Tiger comes out. “It’s gggrrreeeaaat!” 😂❤️
I’m from Cincinnati Ohio and omg you mentioned our chili ahhhhh
There are a lot of combinations that surprisingly good together--avocado and ice cream, for example...
"This one has a happy face!" *ADVERTISEMENT* Oh jeez the suspense!
See? Why can't cinnabon make smiley face cinnamon rolls?
What is this enchanting music in the opening?
My heart skipped a beat when I saw the little hands... You often mention your kiddos so I was happy to see at least his little precious hands 😍 God bless you and your family.
I grew up in Iowa, this is a staple for everyone I know, and it's sooooooo good.
im in the midwest and no plz no
I posted this on Facebook.
Retired chef/baker in southern NM- never heard of this combination but will be trying it. Chili will be homemade as will the rolls, although I’d love to try Florence’s recipe. Mine is more traditional.
OHMaGawd lady where’s the butter that you smear on the dough before you sprinkle on the sugar and cinnamon? Butter in the dough itself gives it a tenderness that also helps the roll itself stay softer,longer. What you made is more of a cinannamy bread roll than a sweet cinnamon roll. But maybe that’s what you and Florence meant to make? Anyhoo it all looks de-lish!
Looks like a pregnancy craving lol😅
I'm from the south in America... Georgia. And I love cinnamon rolls with chili. I've been eating the two together since I was a kid and get made fun of for it a lot. I haven't had it in a while, but now I'm really wanting to make cinnamon rolls and chili now, thanks Emmy. :P
Yes, a midwest/prairie thing and it is delicious.  Very nostalgic...
I love your videos!! I find your content entertaining and your voice very relaxing/ soothing :)
Dude...my childhood...they would serve this at lunch at my school sometimes...and what's crazy is i'm from the south. I've never heard of anyone else eating it...i'm so glad it wasn't just my school being insane
I'm from the PNW and I've never heard of this 🤔 what an interesting combo!
Speaking as a girl with half a southern family, my mama would see the omission of butter from a cinnamon roll as an abomination. My grandma would be rolling in her grave if I ever skipped the butter on a lot of things. So I don't think I'll be able to make this recipe in my mama's house lol.
I grew up eating chili with cinnamon rolls. Even the schools served it together. It just goes! Its everything!
That was Florence smiling up at you or down????
Kansas ❤️ lunch room classic
Such a Midwest classic! (Hi from Iowa)
I've had all meat chili before and it just isn't as good as meat and bean chill imo. Don't @ me
real chili has no beans in it
The top of that cinnamon roll reminds me of my dog's puckered asshole 😂
I eat my chili with cornbread so cinnamon rolls and chili sounds amazing
I grew up in Missouri and school lunch would always consist of a big cinnamon roll with a bowl of chili.  Still doing so to this day.
Yum I remember we use to have these on Friday’s at school lunches I’m 50 Now lol and still remember smelling them from down the hall cooking with home made chillin every Friday my kids still have these at there school also looove them can’t wait for fall to make them
Pastry chef here... I've never made a cinnamon roll without butter, that sounds like it would be dry, but I do like the addition of white whole wheat flour... we do this in bread frequently... it adds a nice malty kick and extra flavor without being overtly whole wheaty in flavor or texture... I also prefer to bake mine in cake pans, it helps keep the side from drying out and stops them from spreading too much... have never thought to do chili with these, but I have put cinnamon in chili before and it tastes good so I can imagine the flavor would work... the midwest is always responsible for unusual combos hahahaha
love you bunches Emmy but dont talk to your food lol
The combination of cinnamon with chili does not sound weird at all to me. Indian dishes are often made with cinnamon
You got so excited for the smiley face on the cinnamon roll 😂
One of the great pairings of school lunches across America, was the pairing of chili and cinnamon rolls.   That cinnamon roll was SO GOOD.  Dipping the cinnamon roll in the hot chili, was a great combo.
I’ve lived in Montana my entire life and I’ve never heard of this combination before...Emmy, my 5 year old son and I love watching your videos!  He thinks you’re very pretty 😌
Love the little hands that are helping you!!!
My favorite sandwiches is Turkey, cheddar cheese on toasted raisin cinnamon bread.  I don't like mayo so I don't put any on my sandwich, but I'm sure it still will taste fine.
I'm from Iowa and I've never seen someone eat this. /:
Emmy’s videos are kinda like Marvel movies... there’s always a little gem at the end 😊
I always put cinnamon and unsweetened cocoa powder in my chili. It adds a wonderful depth of flavor.
This sounds a bit too weird for my taste... and this is someone who's eaten Chef Boyardee ravioli with cabbage, as a kid..lol.
Definitely the much anticipated school lunch. I still make this combo for dinner. We dig it.
personally I would add the salt last since it can negatively impact the yeast
I always thought the combo was wired.
Wyoming too. It was a lunchroom staple.
Haven’t started and I wanna eat it 😂
In my vegetarian chili is cinnamon, too. It sounds crazy at first but it's taste great.
Just started to get back on keto and now I'm watching you eat homemade cinnamon rolls. 😥
what is the red string around neck ?
indiana
Would love to try that!!
09:45 I had a few glasses of wine and forgot what I was watching for a moment haha :D love Emmy’s videos!
This was a lunchroom favorite of mine in Elementary and middle school, growing up in Oklahoma in the mid to late 80's...It is a very southern thing as well!
Yes. Yes. Yes. We had this in school in Oklahoma! I miss it! One of my favorite meals ever!
Chili and cinnamon rolls from Atlas obscura https://trib.al/YO7BN3q
I live in Washington State...when I was in school, I had chili and Cinnamon Rolls at least once a week when I was in school....I thought everyone had tried the combo at least once lol
Try turkey chili, Cincinnati style, with orange swirled rolls. Becky Hen, if you read this.... Its still a winner from Indy to Reno!!!
All cinnamon rolls should be smiling :)
EMMY - You gotta try the new Chocolate Peanut Butter Pie and Rocky Road OREOS :D
I saw extra hands! :P
it almost reminds me of Cincinnati chili which is slightly sweet.
Washington resident. Never heard of this combo in my life, and it sounds absolutely revolting.
I’ve never eaten neither chili nor cinnamon roll! These guys aren’t popular in Poland :( Does anyone know a recipe for yummy vegetarian chili?
Your reaction when you saw the smiley face was just the greatest!! Totally made my day, I'm a dork too lol
I grew up in Wyoming and we had this about once a week for school lunch.
I "aw'd" at the smily bun. xD
It probably came about because those kids wanted to eat their dessert but they weren't allowed to before they ate the chili lolol
I'm from central Kansas and we had this combo in our school, crunchy munchy chili day was the best day! I have been binge watching your videos! My husband has a bunch of MREs and you totally make me want to try them!!
I'm born and raised in Iowa and I never heard of this before.
I use a touch of cinnamon in my Tongue & Cheek Chili. That's Beef Tongue and Hog Jowl chili by the way.  It's great stuff.
Emmy...is that one of your boys helping you mix the eggs etc. for the rolls? He looks pretty professional! Mixes very well! Does he want to be a chef one day??
So weird seeing a part of my childhood here! Every Halloween; my family would have cinnamon rolls and chili-mac.
As a child in Ballard, WA I loved our Fri reg. school lunch of chili & cinnamon rolls! It was especially welcoming on cold fall through early spring days! The smell of both cooking wafting through our old brick "main building" made our bellies growl hours before lunchtime & made it nearly impossible to concentrate on school work! Oh how we loved the policy of "Clean your plate & you may have 2nd helpings" on Fri!💕
I’m surprised the recipe didn’t call for you to put butter down before the cinnamon sugar mixture and no double rise on the pan before baking? But the still looked really good and easy😃
This sounds good but I just don’t know about the cinnamon part but maybe a glaze doughnut
No butter?! Paula Deen would be upset
This is what Kansas school lunch dreams are made of.
7:40 I used to work with a guy who also worked at Cinnabon. He said they figured out how much butter goes in each roll and it comes out to about a stick of butter. For each one!
Right off the bad I figured this would taste so good. The cumin in the chili with the cinnamon from the roll pair together perfectly. Almost like Indian food
Not a thing in Oregon that I know of...lived here my whole life and this is the first I've heard of it. Pepperoni pizza and chili on the other hand, yes.
Similar to chili with a peanut butter and syrup sandwich. Often served when I was a kid at school lunch. (Georgia) sweet and salty/ savory is awesome!
Emmy’s too powerful. She had me eating PB and Mayonnaise and now I want this. I think I would eat poison if she said it was good.
Yes I love this combo! It was my favorite grade school lunch in the 70’s in WA :)  I’m an eat chili and cinnamon roll separate kind of person, but you inspired me to try icing free rolls with chili. Thank you for bringing a happy memory back to me.
Sounds very strange but some people eat chicken and waffles. Not my cup of tea but whatever floats your boat I guess
I'm from Ohio and I love Cincinnati chili, but I've never known it to have cinnamon in it.
All cinnamon rolls should arrive smiling. :)
Loved the Miss Piggy happy roll! lol
Gotta agree about the Cobra.
cinnamon rolls deserve buttercream frosting!
Never heard of this combo and I hope to never hear of it again. Just soooooooo wrong. 😉😁
I'm pretty open minded but this one I don't get...
Sure would like to have the amounts for the ingredients for the cinnamon rolls
What the hell kinda Texan is putting tomatoes in their chili? They must be stopped.
oh man, didnt realise this was just a midwest thing. everyone else has really been missing out lol
I tried this combo yesterday for lunch. It was delicious 😋 xx
My mom always made cinnamon twists to go with our chili. I thought it was strange when people didn't have the combo.  Also, in elementary school, they served cinnamon rolls on chili day. So yummy on a cold winters day in Utah.
Cinnamon rolls are good with anything!
As kids we did not have chili with my grandmothers cinnamon rolls but hearty navy bean soup with a ham hocks. Sweet and savory for the win!  With chili yes please, will try.
tf happened to her right arm? was it always like that? i just noticed all the scars.
Makes absolute sense to me! I love cinnamon in my chili so a cinnamon bun is a logical combination.
love when the boys little hands come in to help mommy cook AHHH GOALS EMMY
The knee jerk reaction to the idea of this combo was "Yuck" but I put cinnamon in my chili and spaghetti meat sauce.  The only difference here would be the sugar, but if you are using a leaner dough...  I can so see this being really good!
Oh this one actually isn't new to me for a change! I live in Kansas and they even offer this in school lunches. I'm not a chili person, but everyone else sure loved it!
i thought she said "that looks mine" when she was zooming in of the glazed rolls and i thought "I'm going to start saying that cause when food looks good i want it to be mine."
Emmy my dear, i live in northeast ohio and we semi cook ground beef and roll it up and then cut them like cinnamon rolls and bake them. When they comeout we top them with cheese and salsa and sour cream and we call them pinwheels.Either way they are good, im a new subscriber to your channel and i enjoy the videos.
Emmy how do I send you recipes?  I am not on facebook
😋😋😋😋
*35 year Oregonian here and I've never heard of this* 😂
This is a common lunch in Eastern Washington schools, I love it! While I prefer cinnamon rolls with my chili, my dad always served his chili with peanut butter toast.
All cinnamon rolls should arrive smiling. :)
I’m from Kansas and have had this combination since I was in elementary school. My Colorado family doesn’t think it’s that great but I always have cinnamon rolls with my chili. Now, with that being said I don’t mix my chili and cinnamon roll. I just like them on the same plate.
I have never heard of this combination... omg. But I admit I love both yummmm :) Good video!
Thanks so much, that sounds great!  One of my favourites is grilled cheese sandwiches with strawberry jam - YUM!
Yes! This is popular in Nebraska! I remember everyone eating it back home.....The restaurant chain "Runza" would sell it. I love your videos btw!
I’d eat it after smoking a joint
Sounds delicious. A lot of people put cinnamon in their chili
Florence would have loved this 🖤 this video makes me really sentimental. Thank you
i like eating my chili with hershey's kisses.
Our cafeteria always served this combination. They called it “crunch munchy chili” which was chili served over Fritos and topped with cheese and dessert was always a cinnamon roll.
What does she say before trying something? I know it’s something not in English haha
I wanted to see ur kids try it o:
Aw, Texas Chili never met a tomato....or beans for that matter...  'True Texas Chili' (fake trademark symbol) is usually made with pureed smoked Anaheim (or Ancho) chilies, (some other stuff), and shredded brisket, slow simmered over several hours in a dutch oven.  No onions, tomatoes, beans, or etc.  (I myself happen to like chunks of cooked tomatoes and sauteed finely chopped onions, but I also never claimed to have made 'True Texas Chili' either. YMMV)  I will *definitely* have to make those cinnamon rolls sometime!
I can only imagine it's like dipping soft bread into a chilli? It doesn't sound as bad as some people are making it out to be hehe
i wanna hug
Not eaten in Missouri. O__o  I make cinnamon rolls a lot and I put melted butter w/ a dash of vanilla on the dough before spreading the cinnamon sugar on it. I use a challah style bread for it. I don't put frosting on mine though. I think it probably depends on how you grew up eating them. I have never seen them made without butter in the middle.
I’d love to see u Emmy make aligot.. u know the cheesy mashed potatoes
Idk who Florence is but she needs to be arrested for crimes aginst humanity.
Great... now I’m hungry 😐
Emmy never pu salt directly onto yeast it can kill the yeast and i put cinnamon and chocolat in my chilli all the time
That’s the cutest cinnamon roll I’ve ever seen!
This looks so yummy! 🤤
I had that combo when I was in grade school.
I go to a public school in eastern Washington, this was served at my school a few times and was very confused, apparently it's very common here! ( I am from California, all of my friends who grew up here love it!)
You said white whole wheat like stewie from family guy 😂
I'm pregnant and this looks so fucking good right now.
I grew up eating peanut butter sandwiches with my chili. I’m from Missouri.
I’ve never added masa to my chili. My family uses 2 tablespoons of smooth peanut butter to thicken chili. We also make a recipe called Scalloped Corn and have it at every meal. You should try it!!!
Wait, wait, wait....no butter in the cinnamon rolls? You know...BEFORE the cinnamon/sugar mixture? Strange!!
Growing up in Iowa we had this is school all the time.   Some people would eat one then the other, and others would dump the chili on the cinnamon rolls.   I think I need to make this now!
I've had this and I loved it.
I like dipping PB&J sandwiches into my chili, so I imagine this would have a similar effect. I think it's the combo of the super sweet and savory that I like so much.
cinnamon rolls without butter?????  they look so dry. 😞
Shelby's the best Emmy!🍽🍥🍛
I'm from Nebraska and grew up eating chili and cinnamon rolls together! I absolutely love it and it's one of my favorite flavor combinations. The spices in the chili and the sweetness/savory flavors of the cinnamon rolls complement each other perfectly. It always tastes like home to me and has become so normal for me that sometimes I forget that it's not a typical combination in surrounding states or regions!
As a child we would have this combination at my school. I just never thought about it. I never thought that it was a weird or different combination
I'm surprised you didn't bake them close together like biscuits.
y do u hate yourself emmy. love yourself. ever since your makeup tutorial i worry.
You should try a concha with frijoles refritos! (My dad's favorite guilty snack) or add slices of banana in arroz rojo (my own personal favorite) or platano macho to a plate of lentejas!!!! We Mexicans do know how good salty and sweet goes together!!
I have to ask this (keep in mind, I'm in New Zealand): Why is the cheese in the US so poke-your-eyes-out *yellow* and the butter so underwhelmingly white? Here, the butter and cheese are of similar yellow shades and neither colour would melt your eyeballs. I suspect Americans might look at our cheese and think it is extra mild in the same way I look at US butter and think 'is that sour cream?'
My family makes our chili with cinnamon, so I’m sure this was delightful!
Cinnamon rolls and savory anything + cheese is great
I love waffles with peanut butter and bacon, no one else will try it though. I can see how this would work.
Never heard of it here in Colorado.
I think one or two shakes of cayenne would have sufficed 😂
Iowan here. Can confirm, chili and cinnamon rolls are an insanely popular thing here. Its just not chili without it. And its not just our lunchrooms. Any chili cook out always has fresh rolls.  Something else that was popular, specifically at the highschool i went to, was putting a piece of cheese on the cinnamon roll and then the chili. I never tried that myself but i guess everyone else liked it. People around here also dunk their rolls more than pile the chili on top
Noooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
Chicago my favorite is chili topped with chopped raw onion with sour cream...OR topped with shredded cheese & chopped onion. Yum.
im from oregon and ive never heard of this combination in my life 🤔 but it actually does sound good
Been watching you for awhile & now that you declared your love for the Shelby Cobra, you are definitely my favorite Youtuber!!
Hi Emmy, Love your videos!  I did not have this combo, but i had a combo of spaghetti with the cinnamon roll on the side, in elementary school. I'm 51 now and I still crave a cinnamon roll when I eat spaghetti. It's delicious!
When I lived in Kansas for awhile cinnamon roll and monkey bread were popular with a bowl of chili.   I am from Ohio though, and I have never me anyone that has done this, but MY family likes to dip a slice of soft white bread, smeared with peanut butter into the chili.  It’s so yummy!!! Mind you, we do a slightly spicy chili and it goes so well with the sweet/salty peanut butter!  Hope you will give it a try sometime and let me know!  I can’t get anyone to try it! Lol
I'm from Kansas and had this for one of my school lunches. We love making cinnamon rolls when we have chili at home.
No butter with the cinnamon sugar 😫😫😫😫
looks delicious!
Confirming the Iowa school lunch angle. I have worked in many schools in the state, and the combination is ubiquitous. I was told that the "lunch ladies" often baked on the day that no bread was delivered. I assumed that chili would be an easy recipe to cook along with the more labor intensive cinnamon rolls. I think about a quarter of the teachers ate the rolls and chili together - the rest of us enjoyed one at a time.
If you read this Emmy you must make tomayo sandwiches!
Yummy! I would probably like this combo because I love sweet and savoury :)
Emmy, where did you get your cooking pot? Or what kind is it?  Btw I'm curious what the the food together takes like!
Now I wanna try it lol
Miss your candy and snack videos. I probably will make the cinnamon rolls but not with the chilli. 😀
All cinnamon rolls should arrive smiling. :)
In pueblo co we had it at lunch at school its amazing!
Do you have any sisters who are single, cause you are adorable Emmy :)
Went to school in Eastern Washington and this was a staple in the school lunch menu. Make it myself now but use my waffle iron to cook the canned type cinnamon rolls. So tasty!
Is there some way to get her cookbook?
Yummy 😋
Here in Maine we love to chew gum and eat peanuts at the same time, another one of our favorites is to brush our teeth and drink orange juice. Maybe you could review these two local favorites!
It’s funny how people don’t realize things they grew up with aren’t normal in other places. I moved to Philadelphia a couple years ago and all the pizza places here put dollops of ricotta cheese on white pizza. It’s delicious but strange. When I pointed it out to some native Philly friends they were so confused by the idea that ricotta cheese isn’t put on white pizza everywhere else.
I plop cornbread in my chili. 🤷🏼‍♀️
I'm from Germany and some american food combinations sound very...unusual and kinda disgusting to me
I moved to Nebraska about 15 years ago, and this is definitely a thing here. There’s a local restaurant chain called “Runza” that does this well. Which makes me think that you should look into trying a runza. It’s kind of like a sandwich calzone, and they’re popular in this neck of the woods.
You’ve convinced me to give it a try! Maybe make a vegetarian chili. Mmmm!
Never heard of this and I am 54
All cinnamon rolls should arrive smiling
I like to drizzle honey on my chili, sooooo good!!!
I live in Iowa...never heard of this but sounds like a good mix. We eat hearty here bc alot of field and labor work and we get some wicked cold winters. We always had chili and rice mixed with diff things like potatoes corn etc
Emmy, did you forget the butter in the layers when you rolled the rolls or did they not include that? I've never seen cinnamon rolls made w/o using butter. But then again I've never heard of this combination of chili and cinnamon buns. I don't eat bread with my chili though I'm more of a sour cream, cheese, cilantro kinda girl. Blessings.
And i thought it was weird that my mom would eat a pb&j with her chili, doesn't seem so strange now.
No. Just, no.
wait shouldn't there be butter rolled up with the bun?
When you first posted this on Instagram last week I was initially kind of...grossed out. But once you kind of explained it and I put some thought into it, it actually makes a lot of sense.  (It makes more sense than that chili spaghetti nonsense they eat in Cincinnati. Also, chili needs beans to turn it into a stew or you're just eating meat with a spoon, which is weird.)
my friend always puts a few dashes of cinnamon in her tomato sauce when she cooks italian food
at my middle school we always had cinnamon rolls on the same day we had soft tacos.  I now always have the craving for one when I'm eating the other
I'm a new subscriber been binge watching your vids so awesome ^_^ I live in the upper Midwest and chilli is a staple in autumn. We home make ours and chilli without beans sounds blasphemous, if there aren't atleast 5 different kinds of beans in it then it's not chilli lol. Never thought to pair with cinnamon rolls though will have to try. Normally we make a batch of corn bread to go with ours and we top the cornbread with a good amount of butter and some maple syrup.
Emmy, while you were talking through the recipe I was thinking, “it tastes so much better the next day” then you said you like yours the next day too. 👌🏻 great minds!
This was very popular when I was in school here in the Midwest. It's also something my family still does today.
Two of my favorite foods.  What's not to like!
My hubs eats chilli with peanut butter sandwiches, apparently it is a southwestern Illinois thing. I hate it, but he wont eat chilli with out peanut butter. And when it comes to cornbread my family has always added sugar and it is amazing.
We had chili and peanut butter sandwiches in school. The sweetness and saltiness is so good together. Never heard of chili and cinnamon rolls. But my boyfriend who grew up in NY has never heard of my version with the peanut butter sandwiches!
Hey Emma I love Shelby cobra in black.
Ohhhh I do remember the chili and cinnamon roll school lunch..i ate it separately but it's delicious
What in the whole Hell is this?
no butter in the rolls?
I'm from Ohio and I've never heard of this combination although we do have sweet chili 😂
I'm so glad to see this, my boyfriend is from Iowa and swears this is the only way to eat chili but I'm from Missouri and had never heard of it until I met him
I learned this in school 50 years ago and still get cravings for it. ✌🐧
Chili with peanut butter added is my husbands favorite..
We eat peanut butter sandwiches with our chili, so I think this sounds good! It's that sweet and salty, plus calms down any heat.
When visiting restaurants in New Mexico, especially in Santa Fe, it is not uncommon to be offered a cinnamon roll before your meal. Always thought that was kinda weird.
My family doesn't eat a whole lot of red meat so when we have chili it has A LOT of beans in it. My cousin bakes it in a 9x13 pan and it's amazing! Unfortunately we all have celiac so we don't eat cinnamon rolls very often
In my school cafeteria we always got peanut butter sandwiches with our chili and spaghetti (and any other tomato based dishes). Maybe that can be one of your next combo videos! I think it was just peanut butter on plain old white bread...give it a try!
I mean... I guess I'm a fan of putting cinnamon in chilli if I'm bothering making it, it gives it a nice heat that works well with cayenne and paprika. But generally not a fan of cinnamon rolls cos they're so sweet, so probably would not want this together. I'd rather just some plan nacho chips with chilli.
You should come to Nebraska and try Runza! They have the old Miller and Paine cinnamon rolls recipe and it's delicious!
My grandmother did this and when I was in Jr. High and high school in Kansas in the 70s got this twice a month for lunch. Good stuff
Spicy hot + spicy sweet. Milk is the mandatory beverage.
My baba's cinnamon rolls use butter and cinnamon sugar in between. These look great!
CIMINAMON ROLLS !
Its a huge thing in Nebraska too. You can go to a restaurant and order it. ❤️
Emmy could you please do a series of gluten free recipes?
"It's GRRREAT!" Made me want frosted flakes! Great video:)
One word: Runza
idk where they said it is in the midwest, but this is not anywhere near where i lived
I grew up in southern Wyoming and we had this meal at least once a week in the Winter. And they served it at my school, too. I never knew it was a strange concept to anyone! Interesting!
Love from Nebraska Emmy! We have a restaurant called Runza here that serves chili and cinnamon rolls in the winter. It’s also a classic in both my family and my boyfriends. My favorite!!
Awwww the little helping hands! ❤️ love you Emmy 🤗
Gurl you know they going to use the Can Cinnamon Rolls.. 😂😂
Chile and a cinnamon roll is the realest combo. From the 1st day of fall to the last day of winter I'm all about that
That actually sounds like some really tasty carnival eats. I would try it at least once.
Chili and cinnamon rolls are so common in Nebraska. Runza sells it and it’s oddly good. Like the cinnamon brings out the spices in the chili
All cinnamon rolls should arrive smiling :)
I use the Carroll Shelby chili mix. Great mix with the masa
North Dakota here, nope nope nope. Funeral bread is a true phenomenon (canned cheese whiz on cinnamon bread) which I have experienced but in 20 years of North Dakota life, I have never seen this chili and cinnamon buns business. It's just the frosting :O
Does Emmy have a video teaching how to make French macaroons
I lived in Kansas and this is the way everyone  eats  Their chili, always  with a  Cinnamon bun.
is it raining with you?
Emmy never put your salt straight onto your yeast. You can kill.the yeast...I could hear all those granules screaming in agony!!
Whats up with the sound?
Emmy thank you for featuring my Grandma’s cinnamon rolls.   She would have loved your segment.   The recipe and end results, however, aren’t quite right.   Contact me at herzogleann@gmail.com and I’ll share with you the actual recipe and a picture  of what the finished rolls look like.   😊  ps - our family never dipped cinnamon rolls in chili.
We eat peanut butter sandwiches with chili.  No jelly.  Just peanut butter.   Anyone else?
What's wrong with your hand Are you okay !
Her lazy tongue really irritates me with her lisp. But idk why I stay watching fml
Something I would eat lol
You should try making cinnamon rolls the Swedish way! I'm pretty sure they origin from here (Sweden). We make them a bit different than the american way!
If that cinnamon bun with the smiley face comes to life like the dumpling in Bao then I’m done
It's a tradition in our home, to have cinnamon rolls and chili together. We also love biscuits and gravy with chili and cheese on top!! And we are indeed in the Midwest.
No I can't say I have had them together.  Let me tell you about my cinnamon roll recipe. Yeast dough like that recipe and let it rise tilll it doubles in size. Then the fun begins. Roll it out as you did, the put a little smear of butter on. Next add a generous amout of brown sugar and sprinkle with cinnamon and roll up. Cut into pieces as you did, not to thin or way to thick. Put onto or into a baking sheet or a glass pan with a light smear of butter. You want to butt the rolls right up against each other.   Cover with a damp cloth and let rise again till doubled in size. Then bake them. No drizzle or frosting. Enjoy 🤤 Best cinnamon rolls I've ever eaten and I've had so many people tell me that too. I've been asked for my family recipe so many times. 🤫
8:46 "Tony, is that you??" Lol
salt kills your yeast you shouldn't add it to it unless you mix the yeast mixture with the flour and after that you can add the salt
I'm from Iowa and don't recall this being much of a thing in my area, but I do remember in school one of the common lunches was scalloped potatoes and ham with a cinnamon roll. It was great, and though we didn't pour it over or anything, it was actually pretty good when you used the cinnamon roll to kind of sop up some of the residual drippings and juices from the scalloped potatoes and ham.   So going by that, I think the chili and cinnamon roll combo would be pretty good.
I had to laugh when she called Idaho Iowa. Iowa is part of the more central part of the US. Its okay, most people confuse them. Got a good laugh out of that though.
This first time i heard of this combination. It sounds weird yet interesting.
That's my favorite chili mix. Texan approved in our house.
Apparently, tuna casserole and blueberry muffins are a combo, too.
In sweden we have this condiment called Kalles Kaviar (creamy salty smoked fish row, definitely an aquired taste, most commonly used on boiled eggs) and I’ve heard several people putting that on top of cinnamon rolls. AND ENJOYING IT! 😷😷
We had this in Colorado for school lunches! I always ate them separately though
Is the sound sound weird to anyone else?
This sounds yummy
Cinnamon in chili is pretty good
those were some sad looking cinnamon rolls lol
hmm. I like ordering chili Fritos and a cone of vanilla ice cream from local ice cream trucks. I like the contrast of flavors so this intrigues me. I eat them separately eating a bit of one and then the other.
Kinda reminds me of auntie fees recipe, except she just puts bacon in between the cinnamon rolls n frys it a bit haha, u should try it! I want to haha :) her video is called "A Mystical Bacon Roll"
Ahhhhhh...Emmy! Soooooo delicious.
Little cute hands!!
I live in Iowa. I was born and raised in ct. This is so obsurd to me but my kids have cinnamon rolls whever they have chili at school and when I asked about it was a very popular combination with many people ive asked.
Sweet, Salty, Cheesy & Bread. This actually sounds amazing.
Rep PNW
Awww I love seeing those little hands helping with your recipes 😩 so cute
Wait.... this isn't a thing in other states? I grew up eating cinnamon rolls and chili all the time in elementary school!!!! Wow... I am shocked.
YUMMMMMM!!! I LOVEEEEE Cinnamon rolls, they are my favorite!! I love making them, with cream cheese frosting!!! I use dark brown sugar instead of regular sugar, then I add organic cinnamon and pie spice. I am so making this, now I'm craving chili and mexican food!! That chili looks so good, you're making me hungry!!! This totally works, I add a Tablespoon of brown sugar to my chili. It is a game changer!!
Less broth Emmy!
Just a tip for the future add the sugar and flour on top of the yeast before the salt as salt can kill yeast if it's put directly on top
It's always funny to me when I see people discover this for the first time. I grew up eating these all the time. It was served at school for lunch, and at home for dinner. One of the fast food joints back home even serves it as a menu item. I'd say in my top 5 favorite foods of all time. I can't even eat chilli without cinnamon rolls any more or vice versa lol
Im from Oregon and live in north Dakota...and I've never heard of this before
I love Cincinnati chilli and I think maybe without the icing I would try it 😄
Interesting thanks Emmy. 🤤
I Like To Tried It ( cool yummy video )
I usually add cinnamon to my chili so I am sure this would be great :) Thank you for the recipe
We enjoy this combo several times throughout the winter, we love it!!!
Toaster waffle ice cream breakfast sandwich... toaster waffle, any ice cream, orange candy crusted bacon dipped in chocolate, and REAL maple syrup...best
trypophobia trigger at 4:34
I dip bread with peanut butter on it in my chili so why not a cinnamon roll?
Love cinnamon rolls & I love chili. Not together though.  I’ve had enchiladas with a cinnamon chili gravy before. Just not for me.  I’ll tear up some cornbread (no sugar) with some chili.  Funny that, because I’ll eat leftover cornbread with butter and preserves for breakfast. 🤷🏼‍♀️ Thanks for being our guinea pig.  😁😘🌻
all cinnamon rolls should arrive smiling:p
she gets points for liking the cobra lol
My elementary school served this combo during the 80's in Southern Oregon.
“All cinnamon rolls should arrive smiling. :)” :P
Iv never done cinnamon rolls where you add dry cinnamon and sugar, without butter. With mine I spread butter on the rolled out dough, then put the cinnamon and sugar on that. Yours look good but very dry.
I’m in Iowa, and this was a classic school lunch combo, and our lunch lady made the best cinnamon rolls I’ve ever had!!!
8:44 Emmy is taking acting lessons from Tony the tiger, I see
I've eaten chilli with bananas my whole life. I almost got in trouble at school for eating it because they thought I was playing with my food lol. Soo yummy.
Emmy is turbo attractive. Nice cooking show.
I’ve been making this combination for the last 40 years
This lunch day always made me feel so conflicted, because the cinnamon rolls were delicious, made from scratch and my favorite, but I was not a fan of the school's chili.
The lack of butter makes me sad.
Please oh please do a vegan cinnamon roll recipe! I’m allergic to dairy and egg so it’s very hard for me to find a decent recipe for baked goods.
Woooow, interesting, all definitely have to give it a try, thanx😁 "all cinnamon rolls should arrive smilling"😁
If you notice most mexican resturants  serve a cinnamon sweet with there chili or tacos. Its a great combo.
It's just curry and a roll....
Wow! This is so interesting, I’ve never heard of or seen this before.
Woah! I need to try that 🙊 And thank you for your all your sweetness and great mood, makes me happy and cozy at the end of a hard working day ❤️
Try cheese on pie.  I’ve seen it at a lot of restaurants!
Ahhh! I wish I had known about this sooner. My husband & I ate the last of the chili I made yesterday for breakfast this morning :-( I put a lot more than ground beef & chili beans though. There’s chili beans, dark red kidney beans, ground beef, pepperoni, kielbasa, green pepper, onion, diced tomatoes, jalapeño, & chili powder of course lol.
And I thought I had seen it all.
Hello Emmy have you ever made the Gotcha Pork Roast from the Anime Food Wars, lol our family call it a Bacatoe it’s 1 package of Bacon, 4 large White Potatoes Mashed, the recipe calls for mushrooms but I can’t have mushrooms so I used 1 large Onion and 3-4 Cloves of Garlic, form into a football like shape, lay out Bacon in a weave like pattern or you can do one piece at a time. Put in large cooking vessel with a wire rack underneath it, cook in oven at 375* for an hour and 10-15 minutes. You’ll have to watch the Anime for the Red Wine Sauce, I can’t remember the ingredients for it but my mom made me an Orange Juice/ Brown Sugar/ Yellow Mustard/ Clove Glaze to go with it, I added Ground Cinnamon and Ginger Powder too even more yummy nummy lol. The next day I made some Roasted Carrots and Celery chopped up to go with it too, on the side. Mom and dad loved it too, it was gone in 2 days lol
To be honest, these recipes I would never eat. But good thing you do. Lol.
I'm from a small town in Minnesota (pop was less than 4000 people) this was our local towns meal. And of course the cinnamon rolls came from the only bakery in town. Sooo delicious. But I only know of maybe half a dozen people in the Midwest who eat this as well. 🤷🏼‍♀️
I grew up in Kansas and this was served in school all of the time. I never understood it. I do NOT like this combination. I want my chili with saltines or tortilla chips.
We had cinnamon roll and chili in school, very good together.
They look like hemorrhoid buttholes
I love the chili seasoning. It is my favorite.    Hopefully I will have time this weekend to make this.  It sounds delish!
If you make your cinnamon roll frosting with coffee it's amazing
I wonder if her sons are adventurous eaters?
NO ONE IN THE MIDWEST EATS THIS😂 BuzzFeed tried saying we eat this and I've NEVER heard of this.
The smiling one made me smile! Looks like it should be a character cartoon.
My school had chili and cinnamon rolls for lunch sometimes, never had the two together
This makes perfect sense. I recently discovered how much cinnamon can add to savory dishes - I mix cinnamon into dry-rub for pork and into BBQ seasoning. It adds to the aroma profile in a surprisng way you wouldn't expect.
I would try this~
I can see how this works, jerk chicken has our idea of sweet spices but is also savory and delicious.
I was raised in missouri and school served chili and PB sandwiches... so also sweet/bread and it was a good combo.
Hmmm.. 🤔🤔
I’m from Kansas and we got this served at lunch at least once a week!! It was my favorite!!
I'm from Missouri & when I was a kid  ( I'm 53 now) our lunch ladies made wonderful cinnamon rolls & served chili with it. It was one of my favorite lunches. Now I work in schools & a few years back it was a popular lunchtime combo.  I love it & now you've made me hungry for it & I'm going to make it. ;)
I’m from Washington and we had this once a week in elementary school here (:
It's like the legend of the French fries dipped into a frosty shake. Will it work or was it all just an international scam?
My elementary school in Missouri always served chili and cinnamon rolls together.  Great combo.
Puff the Magic Dragon lived by the sea
Awesome!
The Pacific Northwest? I've lived in Washington most of my life and Oregon for quite a while and I've never heard of it! I'll have to try it.
Those cinnamon rolls sound amazing! I'm guessing the recipe is a closely guarded secret?
The smilie face had to be the best part !!!!
The Smile on that bun might be a smile   from Florence
Our school lunch used to serve cinnamon rolls & chilli. Not actually on top tho lol
Man food from the Midwest is nasty
I’m from Iowa and this is a classic for us and yes, it is served for school lunch    🙂👌
personally I like blueberry muffin with chilli...yummy
No.
I see this being tasty as well......thanks Emmy !
Sweet hot chilli with beans red peppers and corn bread and garlic butter
Sounds delicious.
They used to serve cinnamon rolls and chili as school lunches. I didn't know people DIDN'T know it was a thing lol.
And sometimes, chili is just meat, no beans.thats how my dad makes it
Why isn't there just a roll full of chili?
EMMY NO
Can you do chocolate stew please!
i love cinnamon rolls :D chili i'm less enthused about, but cinnamon rolls!!! <3
im from Montana and have lived all over the state and have attended tons of schools and have literally never seen or heard of this combo... 👀👀
We had chili in school that came with a cinnamon roll but never combined on top.
Hey Emmy did you have to let the rolls rise again after you cut them?
I have never had chili and cinnamon rolls together, but it sounds interesting.  I have, however, had a honey-glazed doughnut topped with barbecue pulled pork.  It was AMAZING!
Oh my gosh! When we had chili for hot lunch in high school (1970’s) they always served it with a giant homemade cinnamon roll! It was awesome!! They go perfectly together! I had forgotten about that.... We would tear off pieces of the roll and dip it in the chili. I can almost taste it right now. Thanks Emmy!  Edit....I’m from the Pacific Northwest (Washington State)
We had this in public school in SE Idaho. It was always my favorite day.
Emmy! You're a woman of similar taste to me. Shelby Cobras are beautiful cars and an America icon of innovation. Carroll was born in Texas and lived in Odessa for a long time. He raced in overalls on occasion because he was a chicken farmer! Bless that man, he innovated an American icon and has helped thousands of kids with heart problems with his scholarship funding through his charity. I miss him dearly, as all of us who love car culture and the Cobra's iconography. Another thing, that most people don't really know about Mr. Shelby: All his original cobra pictures were the same car, just painted different colors!
That was one of my all time favorite school lunches.  I didn't think twice about it being a Montana thing and not the norm.  Warm foods for cold days.
In Missouri we had chili and cinnamon rolls together in school. OMG it was my all time favorite things at school. I would take the cinnamon rolls apart and dip it in the chili.
Why are people constantly surprised by sweet and savoury combos? It's so common. Sweet and sour pork. Bacon and pancakes. All y'all liberals are surprising conservative when it comes to food.
This is how ive always had chili its my FAV!!
I'm from Kansas and this is very common.  I grew up eating it in school.  Our lunch ladies served a big bowl of chili,  a huge cinnamon roll, winter coleslaw (which is made with cabbage, pineapple, marshmallows and a sweet miracle whip dressing), and a few saltines.  It was heaven on a cold snowy day after playing outside at recess!  I'm 46 years old and still love it! Thanks for some great school memories!
Never had this, it looks kinda good and I never heard sweet drizzle either Lol
This is definitely a Plains states food item. Runza, a Nebraska and surrounding states fast food restaurant, has this combo all winter long! By the way you should make a Runza also called Beirock!!! Please Please
I love making chili with cinnamon rolls, but I am from Nebraska and have a really nice chili recipe if anyone is interested
I always wondered what the heck this was😂 Everytime they gave us chili at school they’d give us cinnamon rolls too. Even when I moved both school districts i’ve been in did this. I live in Colorado btw 😂 so when you mentioned it it all made sense🙃 and I always just ate it separately.
When I make cinnamon rolls flatten dough into a rectangle then mix the cinnamon and sugar with a 1/4 cup of butter then spread that on the raw dough then roll them up and cut them. I also bake my rolls close together in a tin that barely fits them .the drizzle is the same as yours. It just makes for a very moist tender roll. As for eating chilli with it. Nah I'll pass lol much love Emmy
Never heard of that combination.  Could barely stand to watch it....you can have my share!
Iowa here!! We absolutely ate this in school. The cinnamon roll dipped in the chili is the best💜 a fall and winter favorite around here. Thanks for trying it out Emmy!
I grew up eating chili with a peanut butter sandwich. Great combo!
A cinnamon roll with no butter, is no cinnamon roll at all 🤷🏻‍♀️
To maintain the “swirl” of your cinnamon roll Hint: use length ofunflavored tooth floss to go under the dough, cross over the top and slice through. Let me know if you need a home made chili recipe
Emmy, piece of advice - don't pour salt directly on yeast! It can kill the yeast and cause the dough to not rise enough and ruin the final texture. I see it didn't happen this time but I figured you should know! <3
This reminded me of school lunch’s as a kid every time there was chili there were always cinnamon rolls. Never thought anything of it back then I’m sure I thought every place did it.
The BEST way to cut the rolls is to use unwaxed dental floss!!!!!
Yum I always thought it was gonna be a hit :)
Have you ever tried American Cheese and Graham crackers? I love it but everyone I tell says it’s a weird combo. If you ever have a chance please try. Very good.
Emmy I love your videos!  I have 2 recipes that I would like to share with you.  They sound weird but are delicious and were a big part of my childhood.   We were very poor and they were inexpensive.   Now they are nostalgic and I think your other fans would find them entertaining.  Hit me up @ my screen name @ gmail.com.  👍
This is the exact box mix my step dad uses and he eats it with cinnamon rolls too! He came from Limon, Colorado and this came from there. Neat!
We eat peanut butter sandwiches dipped in chili. My mom is from Ohio and it was what all the kids did at lunch in school. It's so yummy especially if your chili is spicy.
Where I grew up in the South, this was a very common combination!  There is a restaurant called Calico County not far from my parents’ house that serves this very thing!  Don’t knock it until you try it!!  YUM!!
If I did this in school I should have be put in detention.  I grew up in the south.
Love eating chili with cornbread
Peanut butter bread and beef vegetable soup
These recipes are like irl shitposts
Ohh no Emmy I'm from Iowa and I've never seen this before 🤢 lol
I like chili with sweet cornbread so it sounds good to me!
Oh I love cinnamon in my chili! Nutmeg too.
Hmmmm Need to try this combination! Corn bread is what I think .... Chilie recipe needs more love
they sell this at our school
This is a thing in Nebraska.  School lunch, and a staple at the regional fast food chain Runza!
I’m in Oregon and I have NEVER heard of this! But it sounds good to me
I know i would probably hate this but this makes me hungry
Cinnamon is in Tajine so it makes a sort of sense that a chili might go well with a cinnamon roll. Tajine is a stewed meat dish from the Maghreb (northwestern Africa) and it has a lot of aromatic spices in it. It's really good.
I think it would be cool if you did a series creating and trying your viewers childhood frankenfoods.  I have some doozies . . .
I can't with those "cinnamon rolls " 😂
That’s so funny! Growing up in Missouri, they always served cinnamon rolls with chili at school!! I never realized it wasn’t a common pairing 😄
I'm from the Midwest and never heard of this
Yep! Had this for lunch every first Wednesday of each month. In a small town in Colorado!
Carroll Shelby's chili is the BEST!
My mom went to school in Storm Lake, IA in the 70's & 80's. She said that they would serve this at school during lunch time.
Emmy, do ur kids and hubby eat ur concoctions? And the rest of the army rations..I know sometimes u have a lot left over so just curious if they do and if they like them.. they seem 2 b fantastic eaters from wht u have shown us...I know my lil would for sure eat all the snacks/candies sent from all over the world but not sure bout the other things!
I live in Indiana and I've never heard of this combo.
Had it when I lived in Washington State. So good.
Awe the smiley face 😊
I didn’t have that while I was in school 😂😂
I once made pulled pork stuffed cinnamon rolls; they were amazing!
This is an abomination.  Nice.
Emmy, you are so odd. And I love you. Xoxo 😂🤣👍♥️
It makes sense that this works. We always eat our chili with cornbread (which has a good amount of sugar in it). I think I might try this combo.
This is a staple winter meal for me from Runza in Omaha NE!!
Shelby Cobra. The car I’m named after.
That's a stomach bomb waiting to happen! 😖 Lol I can see the cinnamon bread, but the icing is what deters me.  But she looked so excited n child-like when she tasted it! Lol I will hafta muster the courage to try it one day this fall.
Hi Emmy!  I live in Kansas and we love chili and cinnamon rolls.  My chili recipe (with beans) is a little different, we chop peppers and onions and cook them with the beef, add chili powder, cumin, cayenne, and other seasonings,  add v8 juice and the beans.   Everybody has their way of making chili though.   My family doesn't get cinnamon rolls every time we make chili... it's a family favorite, so we are making it often,  but the rolls are an occasional treat.  I'm glad you liked it.   Thanks fur great, entertaining videos.
Our family’s go to chili recipe is Carol Shelby’s.
I’m from Kansas and I never knew it was weird until I moved away! We had it every other Friday at school!
Thanks for doing more of Florence's recipes! All cinnamon rolls should arrive smiling. :)
In Kansas, I grew up eating this all the time. Especially in the fall and winter months. Now I make it for my kids.  P.S.....I love you, Emmy! 😍
Hugely common in Iowa and Nebraska!! We always had cinnamon rolls on chili day along with applesauce and carrot sticks and celery! delicious
And people say Americans have no culture. Explain this sweetie.
Looks yummy! I add a can of Rotel to my chilli. Now you’ve got me wanting chili and cinnamon rolls!
I just made delicious chili in my slow cooker but I can't imagine ruining it with cinnamon rolls! It's funny that you really love this recipe because when I saw it I thought that this was probably one of the strangest/grossest things that you've eaten, yet! LOL. To each his own!
Looks good then again I like weird food combinations 😂 but I would like to think it's a good balance of sweet and savory
This was one of the favorite school lunches at my schools K-12. It is a standard Nebraska combo at Superbowl parties too.
All cinnamon rolls should arrive smiling :)
I didn't know there was another way of chili. My family always covered a cinnamon roll with chili. I was surprised the first time I ordered chili in a restaurant and it didn't have a cinnamon roll in it.
Been pumping the videos out!! Hell yeah!!
What is going on with your arms?? Have you switched from bee keeping to bear  keeping??  😂 🐻🐝
My boss dips a peanut butter sandwich in chili pretry sure that's a real thing too.
This just reminds me of when I was a kid and at my table, everyone would save one bite or one sip of everything on their tray, and we would combine it all and dare each other to eat it....
Grew up with cinnamon rolls and chille. However your cinnamon roll needs more frosting imagine a cream cheese frosting just without the cream cheese and that is the consistency you want
Shouldn't the rolls rise one more time before baking?
I think this works because of the spices. There’s a very popular chili chain called Skyline Chili. And in their chili you can clearly taste a spice that I believe is allspice. It’s almost like a pumpkin pie. And cinnamon can be awfully close in taste so I can see why these would taste great together.
why..
I'll never understand the random dislikes that videos like this get?
I KNEW this would be good. Like waffles and fried chicken. Like what I got out of hospital cold case:pasta salad with the works and an a blueberry muffin. On the same prepackaged tray get me? Lol. Not that I picked individually myself. Fabulous! You never know til you try right Emmy? Tho there are some things I have to pass up myself...like insects and sheep buttholes and...well you know. Thankyou! Another great idea! Don't forget the fudge made with pinto beans! Yum!😍✌😈👊🐾🐝🐤
Emmy! Have you ever tried pepperoni rolls?! They’re a West Virginia favorite that the rest of the world doesn’t seem to have! If you try them I recommend having them with some good Mac and cheese. It’s a common school lunch here in West Virginia.
like sweet cornbread with chili, i get it
My husband is from Iowa, and chili with cinnamon rolls was an average school cafeteria lunch for him. (I love it too!)
this sounds so good! I remember my elementary school lunch ladies used to put cinnamon on a side of sliced pickles we could get.
Black is a very flattering color on you :)
I love this combination!
I'm from Indiana and I usually am up on food trends both new and old. I've never heard of this. I guess it makes sense but no thank you. Lol. However, we put peanut butter in our chili.
"All cinnamon rolls should arrive smiling. :)" ...in a Shelby Cobra!
Been eating this combination since I was a child. It does surprisingly work, its delicious. So glad you tried it and liked it.
We do ham and beans with corn bread and syrup.. so good.
Reminds me of Chile with cornbread.
I think you should have rolled them a bit thinner.
I usually use beer to make chili, one time I ran out, so I used ginger ale, it turned out really good. I also aways but cinnamon, all spice & nutmeg in my chili seasoning mix.
This can’t not be good!
All cinnamon rolls should arrive smiling!! We had cinnamon rolls with chili at school all of the time in KY.  I never realized it was because it was to eat together!!!    Lol.  Love this!!   Thanks Emmy!!!
never heard of this just peanut butter bread
I've never heard of it, but, I can see how it would work. I make my cinnamon rolls with real butter, in the dough, and spread on before adding the cinnamon sugar....pure heaven !  Also, I have to have sliced green onions on my chili
I have lived in the Midwest all my long life & and I have never heard of putting chili on cinnamon rolls.
I have to make this for my mother it looks delicious and she will love it
Nope.
I didn't realize there was anything to it, but when I was in elementary school in the early 90s our cafeteria did serve chilli and made from scratch cinnamon rolls. It was definitely a favorite. Nobody ate them together, though :p (edit: this was in northwest Florida, btw.)
Lol I don’t think school lunches are even that good anymore...
I'm impressed that you love the Shelby Cobra
Im from northern Illinois and my boyfriend is from southern Illinois, his mom makes his chili with peanut butter and maple syrup sandwiches! Its amazing! I cant eat chilli without that combo now!
I saw a recipe for a smoked watermelon...looks exactly like a ham! It would be so cool if you tried that
And you forgot the chopped onion and sour cream on the chili.
One of the greatest disadvantages of cooking are scars, I've got a couple on my right arm, I see you have a few, Emmy D: Taking vitamin C helps fade them
Also those rolls should be in a 9 by 13.
Your first mistake was making chili from a box..,the rest is down hill from there.
We eat this in Oklahoma too
I lived in north west Iowa and had this all the time for school lunch and absolutely loved it! This is a must try!
My husband said he loved this combination when he was in school. They served it for lunch. We live in Arkansas
That smile was Florence, showing her approval :)
our school lunch room used to serve peanut butter sandwiches with chili when I was younger.
Do you like what your tongue tastes....? Realize that recipe is Emmy MADE.....
Nebraska school lunch in the 70s. Strangely delicious!
When I was in school in southern Illinois, we had peanut butter and white corn syrup sandwiches with chili.  Still love the combo!!
Emmymade mail order meals.
I remember when my school used to serve chili, they always had a cinnamon roll, and I dipped my roll I into my chili, and loved it.
Cable show!
lol. Grew up in Idaho and they served this at school all the time :) I enjoy reading where people had this all the time and where people didn't know about it. All cinnamon rolls should arrive smiling. :)
TV SHOW....
Chili and Peanut Butter Sandwiches!!!!!!
When you eat any sandwich where the bread has some sweetness it'll always taste better than a savory bread. Wether it is with cheese, egg, veggies, meats and seafood. And the cinnamon is a great spice with meat. So no wonder the combo tasted great!
they used to serve this to me in elementary school........ I'm 30. and im from Colorado
This is the stuff of school lunches! Ah memories! Yes mam, tasty! Is it fall yet?
Takes me back to elementary school omgggggg
Emmymade..... Emmymade.... Emmymade.....  We hold a parade....  For Emmymade....  Delicious THINGS.....  Where can I buy your pots and pans and recipe books?
That's my favorite car of all time, Eleanor from gone in 60 seconds, I knew I liked you for a reason. Great video as always emmz
Kansas raised. This is the BEST combo. It’s become a natural pairing for those of us that went to school here.
All cinnamon rolls should arrive smiling :)
Can you eat Puerto Rican food??????
Love this combo😊
This is not fair. No offence but could you please wear a shaw...? I can not focus on the recipe!  No... I do not watch television or cable but she is show worthy.  A good investment for a network!
Chili and Cinnamon buns are an Iowa Delicacy.  I have heard that some freaks eat cornbread with Chili.  You Monsters!😋😊
You are the best Emmy. Weeks would not be the same without you Tuesday and Thursday videos. Thank you for your hard work and lovely personality
Can you post the receipt
Just the thumbnail legit made me gag. But I'mma power through this.
This was my favorite lunch in grade school in Oregon The head cook used her own homemade cinnamon roll recipe. No one missed this lunch. Yum yum.
I love Emmy videos!!
Cinnamon roll bowls for the chili!
I used to have this at school in Missouri!! Now I’m an adult and make it for my kiddos. So nostalgic.
That was Florence smiling at you!! So precious!! Now I'm craving chilli and it's 111°F outside. Damn you Emmy!! 😘😘😘
9:35 aww Emmy is so adorable!!!
All cinnamon rolls should arrive smiling. :)
I’m from Colorado, we had chili and cinnamon rolls at school a couple of times a month, but I never ate the two together
Liked and shared! That said, I'm on weight watchers so I'm very conscious of food "point values". But I make a form of chili that costs no points in the diet. Now I just need to work on the cinnamon roll part.
Anyone else add noodles to their chili?
This is actually something I would try🤣🤣
i'm just here for the chili recipe
im from colorado, the only chili that goes on top of things is Green chili
Happy sweet family makes happy sweet rolls..well done Emmy..
Lol she's cute.  And that looks like a delicious combo.🤗
This reminds me of this weird thing I would do in school. I'd buy cafeteria pizza, and a cup of chocolate pudding. I'd eat most of the pizza, then dip the crust, sauce cheese and all, into the pudding. Everyone thought I was crazy, but I swear it was so good, and definitely a combo I'd be willing to go back to 👌🏻
Please make smoked haddock, you soak it first as its salty. It's called Finnan haddy.
Emmy you make my day!!! I wish we were friends 😊
Did I get here early enough for a heart this time?
Add some Frito's to the chili and your favorite drink. 👀✌
No, this is weird....
your makeup looks amazing emmy!
At first I side eyed it but then I thought about it and it sounds delicious
Had that for school lunch in Nebraska like every other week back in the 90's.  The chili was more sweet than spicy though.  Excellent choice, Emmy
I'm an Oregonian born and raised, never heard of this. I think someone's pulling your leg.
I want chilli and cinnamon rolls. That sounds amazing. I also want pizza with french fries and a Frosty. I am very hungry.
those wittle baby hands 😭
My mom does this all the time she likes hers separate.
For the record, I've lived in Colorado for 26 years and have never so much as heard of cinnamon rolls and chili. That's defo not remotely a thing here.
Yeah... Minnesotan here.... I've never eaten these two things together but interesting.
😍😍
I grew up in Iowa and this was a staple even in school lunches. I've converted many Texans (where I live now) into cinnamon rolls and chili lovers! I can't have chili without the cinnamon rolls!
You should do the Cincinnati Chili on Spaghetti!
Taste really good on a honey bun as well
My elementary through high school in small town Oregon served this combo for school lunches. It was tasty. I still love the combo but I haven’t made it in a while.
You can mix a few tablespoons of soft butter into your powdered sugar icing for a great richness and flavor.
I'm from Colorado and chili and cinnamon rolls are very popular around here lol my mom would make it during the winter time & school sometimes would serve it.
YES! was my favorite lunch during elementary school! Missouri here.
I'm from Kansas and we almost always have cinnamon rolls with chili lol did it as a kid too. Midwest cuisine!
All cinnamon rolls should arrive smiling. :)
I had an ex in Kentucky that swore by this. Said they served it at school when he was a kid. I love any excuse to eat cinnamon rolls so I was always down lol!
If I lived within the same Zip Code as Emmy, I'd easily weigh in at 400 pounds.
All cinnamon rolls should arrive smiling :)
That would be good with big cup of coffee.
The cinnamon rolls look a little pale..
When my older sister moved to Iowa to be with her husband it became a necessity to have cinnamon rolls and chili during the winter! We all thought it was weird (even though it seems totally normal now lol).
Now that you mention it we did always have cinnamon rolls on chili day at school. One of my favorite lunches.
This reminds me of Cincinnati chilly... it has chocolate in it, which is delicious! To die for. This looks so yum! 💚
I have been in the Pacific Northwest since the age of three. This combination is a new one!
The sweet bread with chili actually sounds really good.
I refuse to tarnish my $8 Cinnabon with $2 chili.
I would definitely  try this out
Hi Emmy can you please do a omurice video
Going to make some cinnamon rolls tonight! Thanks Emmy
This reminds me of something we eat here in Ohio. A bowl of chili or a bowl of vegetable beef soup and on the side, a peanut butter sandwich. In my family we alternate bites. It's really good.
dont make the salt make a direct contact with the yeast.
Wai. I prefer my pickles and ice cream, to be honest (separate). This recipe does sound like a pregnant women's recipe or a stoners snac attack round 3. I appreciate the diversity in these foods.
Every one loves a cheeky smile on their buns... :P
In Canada our chili is maple syrup based, would go perfect with a cinnamon bun.
Being born and raised  in Iowa I can confirm that the combination is absolutely fantastic! 😍
Something look so different about you....your skin is so Beautiful
you need ghost pepper and i think we used trinidad scorpion or whatever its called..... grew them at our house then dried and ground into powder.... been using for like 5yrs now its amazing!!!!!! dont use much tho!!.... also watching these make me wanna eat some of my moms stuffed cabbage.... i might have to buy the stuff to make it then help her with it!!!
A Shelby Cobra fan!  Rally Vincent! :)
Still love this combo--here in Kansas!
I grind my own wheat. I will be grinding some white whole wheat next week to try some of Florence's cinnamon.
Ahhhhhh!!! Emmy I have had a picture of a Ford Cobra 427 in my wallet since I was 16!!! Its my absolute dream car! I nearly fainted when I saw that my best friends neighbor was building the Shelby kit! Ugh... I would love to just sit in one damnit!
You have the oddest chew!😂
I live in colorado and ive never heard anything like this. HAVE I BEEN LIVING IN A SHELL!!!
Cinnamon rolls and chili is huge here in Iowa. I don’t get it because I didn’t grow up here but everyone I know here loves it!
Yeah even before watching, this had win all over it!
This was my favorite school lunch, growing up in Montana.
Emmy look Ms. Mojo gave you a shout out  https://youtu.be/wUWIzualWDc
Is it just me, or is Emmy getting some pipes!  Strong biceps!
Emmy, where are you learning about these recipes from? 😕😕
I grew up in Iowa and I just learned as an adult that pb sandwiches go well with chili. I tried it and it's delicious idk why my parents deprived me of such tasty things!
Cinnamon is actually an ingredient I put in my chili. owo
Yet another surprise
TIL Emmy is into cars.
that was the BEST school lunch!
This reminds me a lot of my favorite meal! I love to put chili on top of my waffles. The waffle is a little sweet but I find that it fits really well with the salty, savory, and kinda spicyness of the chili! I would love to see you try this!! Xo
Oh gosh-  this takes me way back (50 years or so) to elementary school! On Fridays, our school would have bowls of chili with cinnamon rolls for dessert! As a rule my mom would pack a brown bag lunch for me, but on Chili Fridays, I got to buy it as a special treat- it was everybody's favorite!!
I usually use brown sugar in my cinnamon sugar mix for cinnamon rolls. :)
Sweet to see your boys helping.
Wait, yeast and then salt ON TOP? I know it is dry but... that's just weird
I like raisins in my cinnamon roll
Lived in Iowa for over a decade and never heard of this...
Geezz girl u eat some weird shit.
This looks good to me ! I put cinnamon in both chili n spaghetti. My grandma use to heat left over cinnamon rolls in a cabbage leaf lol she said it was healthy.
Was there a 2nd proof on those cinnamon rolls or did I miss it?  There usually is after they have been rolled and sliced.
There are some strange people in the world.
"hwhite whole hwheat" Oh emmy u crack me up
Emmy is into cars too!? I knew Emmy was cool but wow!
looks really good Emmy and would like the recipe for the cinnamon rolls
I’m in IL and have never heard of this combo but it sounds wonderful! I loved seeing the little helping hands in the video. ☺️
that chilli looks oh so delishhh
If you like this you'd like Cincinnati chili, if youre ever in Cleveland ohio and happen to end up at my local skyline let me know!! ill meet you there!!!!! lololol
Back in high school down here in Arkansas I've seen alot of my "friends" eat it like that lol
I love that top your wearing.
Kids in the us have _glazed cinnamon buns_ for lunch?
Cincinnati chili from Skyline and Gold Star is atrocious!!!!!
All cinnamon rolls should arrive smiling. :)
Hey Emmy can you try making a clear pie?
Looks yummy...Greek recipes with a tomato based sauce has cinnamon in it... so chili and a hint of cinnamon on the fresh rolls looks different but positively tasty!
Get heart disease AND diabetes. Two birds, one stone. Of course it came out of middle America.  Keep in mind you're tasting things from possibly the fattest area of the world, careful.
I was born and raised in South Dakota, and have never heard of this combo. It does sound good thought.
We had this at my school all the time in Arkansas
Wait, people eat chili without beans?!
[high pitched voice] "I'm not gonna eat you cause I'm gonna show you to my son. Smiiile" 😂😭 Emmy is so cute
Hey Emmy, I love your videos I watch them on my Lunch Break and on my free time at home! I would love for you to try Lipton Regular Hot Tea with a little bit of sugar dissolved and than put 4-5 or more mozzarella cheese cubes while it's still hot and than use a spoon to taste the melty cheese with the Hot Tea perfect match that everybody I tell is so scared to try please please please 🙏🍵😁 so delicious my grandparents showed me this
I love you Emmy!! 😍😍😍😍
I dunk Peanutbutter Sandwiches into my chili XD
Thank you for reminding me of this, Emmy! We always had cinnamon rolls when we had chili for lunch at school when I was a kid and I loved it! I'm a lunchlady now, but I serve cornbread with chili. I might have to change that!
Looks Yummy! 😊
Is this prison food? This sounds like something from your Prison & Hard Times playlists.
What are the ratios 😭 of the ingredients
We used to get chicken and rice with cinnamon rolls when I was in school.
I add cinnamon and a little sugar to my chili so I'm sure this tastes fine
This was a lunchroom staple when I was growing up in Kansas! It was always a favorite!
Its a nebraska thing! Ive eaten this my whole life
I would never have thought of that combination, but after thinking about it for a bit, I can definitely imagine it working. Cumin, paprika and cinnamon all have some very similar flavor notes. Plus, sweet and salty are always great together. All cinnamon rolls should arrive smiling. :)
Oh yes school lunch.  I was most fortunate to attend a school were the ladies cooked everything from scratch.   Chilli and Cinnamon Rolls a great combination.   Yes I'm from the heartland.  Even our pizza was made from scratch.  Love those lunch ladies.
That's the chilli mix myself and my mom used when I was growing up! Love it
Oh yes!! I’ve gotta make this!! Thanks!!
I can see how this would taste good. I mean I make honey cornbread with chili.
Isn’t it kinda like the idea of the donut burger
Try something from the Philippines...  Champorado (chocolate rice pudding) and fried dried fish.
You are hereby presented with the Bravery for Baking in Black Award! As to the offering, I'm not a sweets person, but a bowl of Texas Red on a slab of cornbread makes my toes curl in delight.
Hi Emmy Sounds yummy
Never heard of this combination, but just wanted to say I LOVE YOU EMMY!! 😍😍😍
back when I was little one in Central Washington State, (basically where they grow apples), there was a place in our town we called The Restaurant. they had chilli on the menu every day and the best cinnamon roles ever. I don't remember The Restaurant's real name. it closed when I was in elementary school but a mug of hot chocolate, a bowl of chilli, and a huge cinnamon roll split with my brother was a big part of my early childhood.
Im from colorado and i live in colorado now.i have never heard of this, but interesting
All cinnamon rolls should arrive smiling. :)      Except when they arrive on my plate. 👿   EDIT: Dan doesn't like cinnamon...
The South too!
I like my Cinnamon buns more buttery and chewy but i feel like these kinds would be more suited for the chili. Looks good!
I'm from the midwest and have never heard of this but damn it sounds so good! I'm going to try it out.
Shelby Cobra 👍🏻👍🏻
Mushi mimi recipe please!!
Eww no beans just meat lol
Here in Cincinnati we put cinnamon and a little chocolate in with our chili, so how bad could it be.
Here in Wisconsin instead of the main argument of beans or no beans (most include beans too) in the chili, we argue over including noodles or no noodles.
Where i go to school i hade red chili but i hade sweet bread with a side but i nevered had chili with cinnamon roll
Ok I can do brains, snails, and almost everything else. This is disgusting!  I can tell by the comments what type of person this appeals too. Lmao 😂 sorry not sorry...
I watched another video about this combination and the comments were crazy!! People were outraged! How can these two things be bad together!?! Thank you for sharing!
Emmy tomorrow is my birthday!!
Born in North Dakota, but now live in Minnesota. I have never heard of this combination.
Oh, those lovely baby hands helping mama!! My heart melted ❤️❤️
Yes ❤️❤️❤️ This is a South Dakota favorite! We don’t usually dip it in the chili though 😂 It’s more of a side. But yes in school we ALWAYS had them together. LOVE THIS.
Ooooo thst looks delicious :)
The rolls look so good and sweet! I love your descriptions ^^

I like cornbread with my chili. Smiling cinnamon roll is so cute.
Being from Nebraska, this is one meal we all always looked forward to for lunch. It's good for any occasional but is especially good in the cold winters.
My favorite!! I have grown up eating pecan wheels or cinnamon rolls and dipping it in the chili!! It so good!
I would never 😂 I was born and raised in the Midwest and I’ve never heard of anything like this. I don’t think the snow has made us that crazy 😂
I’m looking forward for the mushy-Mimi recipe especially with your brother hahaha 😂 but those look good 😍
Emmy, you are cute as a beagle pup. Love your recipes too.
This looks delicious!
I love sweet and salty combos 😊
I recently loved to iowa in 2016 and i came from arizona, where chili is usually on the more savory or spicy side. I was a little surprised not only by the cinnamon rolls given at school with chili but the chili even had a real weird sweetness to it. Im pretty used to it now but it was strange at first.
We had this in elementary school all the time I was always so happy when it was chili day because we got cinnamon rolls!! 😂 The chili was good too but the cinnamon roll was the star lol
Did you have cool whhhhip with the whhhhite whole whhhheat. Sorry FmilymGuynjusy popped in my head. 🤣🤣
I can certainly tell you this was very popular in rural Kansas in the seventies and eighties. Veeery tasty!
From missouri! We always had this at school. Not mixed though.
All of these weird recipes sound like something a pregnant woman would create at 3 AM. Or someone really stoned.
I’ve never heard of a cinnamon roll recipe without butter under the cinnamon sugar recipe 😱
Never heard of this combination. Yum.
My boyfriend grew up in a small town in central Kansas and he said that they served this at the cafeteria where he went to school
I'm a freshman at my high school and tomorrow is Friday so I'm gonna die  #Freshmanfriday
I'm in Oregon and NEVER heard of this!
Try using a string to cut cinnamon rolls next time it helps maintain the spiral

Hey! U! Yeah you, Keep reading... I  Just Wanted you To know Ur beautiful
BABY HANDS 😩😩😍
I love this combo! I could taste it.  Sweet savory is a fave of mine
You should avoid pouring salt directly onto yeast as you risk killing the yeast. Sugar will also kill yeast but not as easily as salt.
Florence's pregnancy cravings must've been wild (assuming she ever got pregnant) lol
