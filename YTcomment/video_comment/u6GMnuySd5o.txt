Love watching you kneed 🫓🫓🫓
Thank you I will try
For the tortillas it doesn’t matter amount of flour, it can over the cup , only for baking
Excellent video! Thank you!
How do you keep the dough from sticking to the rolling pin ?
Best  video I have seen. You actually showed the entire process without editing. Thank you. I will definitely try your recipe.
I used your recipe and they came out fantastic ❤ ty for teaching your making of your food love it love it
i replay video while i make these to have @Simply Mana cooking with me. thank you for sharing video.
Can I use less baking soda instead of baking powder?
Thank you!
They look delicious thanks for sharing!
I appreciate the kneading session❤ this will definitely help me want to try homemade tortillas again… first time not so good😂
I made these yesterday for the second time. First time they were super stiff and I realized how rusty I was at making fresh tortillas. This time I kneaded my dough longer and added a bit more water. My dough wasn’t super smooth like yours until it rested while I got distracted with other things. When I came back to it, it was PERFECT and my tortillas were so yummy. Definitely glad I tried again.
When I was just a little girl my best girlfriend's Grandmother lived with the family (all Spanish ppl) and Grandma made the Best tortillas, totally by hand. I would watch her intently as she slapped the dough into perfect round tortillas. Yummy!!!! Best food I ever ate too! Thank you for bringing this "easy to follow" recipe to me. I'm giving it a try tonight!
On behalf of all us Gringos and any others who have only been able to salivate over fresh, warm, soft tortillas I thank you! WISH ME LUCK!
Awesome - can’t wait to try this recipe.
Thank uou
I use this everytime I make tortillas! I love it so much, thank you!!!!
yummmm
Good video after all this time!! Just made them and they were fantastic!!
Is it possible to over knead? I can't get them to bubble like yours.
Ur truly so amazing Thank you so much best video here on YouTube.
Thanks
Seems as though the more you knead the dough the less sticky it is.☁️ It looks like a puffy white cloud ❣️
I just want you to know that five years later this is the same recipe that I use for my flour tortillas among many other recipes of yours that my family loves! ❤ thank you!
A big thank you from France.. Of all the recipes published here, this one is clearly the best in my eyes.  Just one question: I'm looking to have this texture while including sweet potato? Do you have any advice?  Thanks again !! :D
Will the ingredients change much if I live in a higher altitude (5,000) for the flour or others?
I love Mexican food but it is the one type of food that I just cannot mimic from restaurants no matter how hard I try. I stopped going to bbq, steak, and seafood restaurants because I can cook those to restaurant quality, but Mexican food just remains too evasive for me to perfect.
Uuggghhhh i Don’t get it what I’m doing wrong there’s no bubbles 🤬😡😡😡🥵🥵🥵 there’s still flat and hard
😢 My Mom Made Tortillas All My Life Now I Don't have  Her,Today's Lady's Are Borrachas, , So Sad,,Seriously El Bronco
I rest my dough 71/2 minutes in the fridge and then 71/2 minutes  on the counter under a damp towel. I learned that if the dough is cooler it rolls much better snd yiu dont have to flour your work surface. Practice makes for perfect Tortillas. Thanks for sharing.
My mom use to use flour and masa mixture what would be a good ratio?
Hi, I loved your simple method of preparing flour tortillas. Your technique is very comfortable to follow and your instructions are wonderfully explained. Thank you for your lovely video.🌯
So much appreciate your no cutting away! Its extremely helpful to view the true amount of time required for each step. Bravo!! 😊
You are, by far, my favorite youtuber because of your recipes.  Your videos are awesome and I'm actually able to follow your step by step tutorials to finally achieve great dishes!  Needless to say, my family has been very happy!!!
I just made these again today.  Still wonderful, I love the step by step instructions. Thank you!  Getting them nice and round is still a goal but they were better shaped this time.
those tortilla looks so yummy!
Girl! I live a mile high above sea level and the recipe does so well. Thank you dear for the recipe!
Your hands are THE cutest 😂
Thank you for doing this I appreciate it so much.
Thanks for sharing!
Thanks! Will Definitely Use This Recipe
What a beautiful sight to me. Big beautiful tortillas for burritos and anything else. Thanks for redoing this.  ALLWAYS loved watching the women making these. In Mexico city down town on the street there is a shop for tortillas y solar. They have the most amazing one of a kind all one piece  hand carved stone cooking device that is round and opened up like a blacksmith"s forge with a  head high cone shaped too that is open in the top for a chimney. They burn Mesquite in the base. It is made of porus lava stone. The women stand around with their backs to it shaping tortillas and they toss them like a spinning pizza dough onto the cone to cook. It is amazing. Soy de soul de Tejas. And I have been there many times in my way to Acapulco Dandahermit.
Thank you for showing everything step-by-step👍
You are such a dedicated chef. Thank you for taking time to teach us.
Tried your recipe and technique after a few other attempts with others that yielded less than stellar results. My tortillas came out almost perfectly! In consistency, anyway. They folded and bent just like in the video. I need more practice portioning them out and rolling them so they look more circular and less "artisanal" but this is the recipe I'm going to reference from now on!
I don’t have much success with any bread making. How do you know when the tortilla is cooked through. Should they always puff up? I’ve tried other recipes and they’ve been doughy in the centre
Impressive. Thank you. We use to make these about 40 years ago when kids were growing up. Time to do it again. Thanks for crystal clear instructions. I’d forgotten how I made these.
Have you used oil instead of lard/shortening in the mix? I wanted to try this. Mine comes out thick with a different recipe. I like yours. They look yummy. Thank You.
GREATTTT NOOO DAMN LARD
Outstanding!
I have used your recipe since you post it the first time and it has come just perfect thanks so much 😊❤
Amazing home made tortillas ❤❤❤
Our kids loved them with butter on them when they were little.
Do these not stick to an ungreased skillet?
I always use your recipe when I make tortillas. Taste almost like my mom’s. ❤
I'm glad you said Buttered Flavored Crisco.  Walmart is out of regular crisco.   I'll place an order now.
I had to remind myself that there are people who have no idea how to measure a cup of flour.
Thanks so much for this revised video!!  I have a question. Which do I use, 384 gr of flour as you state or 400 as per description?  Thanks in advance.
*How do you store it for days?* I really don't want to make it everyday. Thank you for your detailed video
Can the dough be made the day ahead and rolled and fried day of?
High altitude = higher cooking heat.
My dough always shrinks. Must get wetter!
I really like the way you explain what you’re doing. Very detailed. I feel more confident to try and make the corn and flour tortillas. Thank you! 👍
I can tell by how these tortillas are fluffing up that they are going to be wonderful. Have you ever tried using a tortilla press for making flour tortillas?
Thanks!
Delicious!!!  Thank you.
Your amazing, you made my day, I'm from Los Angeles and been around Latinos  love Mexican food with a passion, but haven't mastered the tortilla until now, You made it so easy. A long process yes, but easy to understand. Love your videos and buying my daughter your cookbook for Christmas! So she can make me some of your delicious meals.
Ty I tried so hard to make your tortilla recipe but I'm doing something wrong it doesn't come out beautifully like yours it s soft at first then gets hard and cracks lol 😁🙏🕊️
LOVE :) all Your videos, very Simple yet Delicious everytime!
Thank you for this video my wife and I made our first ones they taste great
Hi, May I know  the hot water u have added is roughly how many degree? Thank you.
Great cooking tutorial. I loved the music during tortilla cooking!
you made it look so easy!! Thank you 😊
Thanks for your wonderful recipes and easy cooking style
Thank you
Can you please do another video on corn tortillas mine end up ok at first then turn to crackers. HELP ME PLEASE 🙏,  I stayed with family in Chihuahua Mexico and I was taught by them how to make both flour tortilla and blue corn tortilla . "Which I love " , but because of abuse I suffered. I now suffer from migraines that present themselves with stroke like symptoms, memory loss and other symptoms.  Since then I have tried to make both and the end up like hard crackers
I knew I was doing something wrong with packing my cups of flour. My torts came out like matzah 🫓 crackers lol 🤷🏻‍♂️
Some recipes use baking powder, some don't. What's the deal
Awesome and amazing thank you so much for sharing
The best recipe out there. They came out soft and they taste delicious. I just have to work in the shape because they are everything but round 😂
So very helpful,  thank you very much for sharing 💕
I love this! Thank you so much, so nice to have precise measurements for those like me who are challenged by jargon like a pinch of this or that!  And I made GREAT tortillas, I still need to work on the round part though! ;)
Can I cut the receipe in half?
Every kitchen is a little different I never dared tell my mom that I liked my friends moms tortillas lol
Tip: if you press the edges of the cooking lightly, it will make a big bubble instead of the many little ones.
Can anyone help me find a mixing bowl like this? What is it called? I have become apparently fixated on it
Thank you 😊
I made this and the tortillas were hard and falling apart..although VERY good flavor. Can you tell me what ingredient I didn’t add enough of or which one i added too much of to get that result?!
I made your tortillas and had no issue at all.  Surprised people had an issue…I guess if you don’t cook often maybe some of the things aren’t as common sense as us would think.  All of your recipes I have tried are amazing!
I made your recipe. None of mine were round. But very good and soft. When I used the kitchen aid to mix them and knead a bit the same recipe turned out kind of tough and dry.
I’m making these today.  I hope mine turn out.
Mine turn out hard and the crack
You did very well thank you
Hi simply mama, I followed your instructions to a tee, I fluffed my Flour and weighed it to be exact, added my baking powder, salt, I kneaded my dough for 10 min, I let it rest for 15, I rolled out as thin as I  could, hung them over the bowl, put my fire on 6, and took them off as soon as i saw little brown specs, but they never bubbled and they were like crackers, I played with my fire up and down, still no bubbles, still not foldable only crackable, please help, I would love to have some homemade Tortillas, yours look so Yummy, please let me know what I did wrong, Thanks in advance
Finally a good delicious easy recipe!!! thank you thank you thank you!!! So helpful ♥️
I like to make tortillas daily or every other day bc the kneading relieves pain in my hand.  Can I simply reduce all the ingredients by half to make less tortillas since its just me and my husband?
Your host here is correct you can feel all of the textures when hand kneading but you also can see all of the visual ques from your dough by watching the changes when using a mixer.  Its not bad to use machines, they are consistent and less messy for a lot of users.  Always weigh though when baking. Dont forget its a science.
Currently Making Them! 😋😊 Thank you For this video Simply mama Cooks!! 💕💕
My daughter and I made these today.  Thank you so much.  This is the first time I have had soft pliable tortillas.  I have definitely been adding too much flour when I first started kneading and it was so sticky.  Today I stayed the course and kneaded and kept my hands out of the flour!  Delicious.  Oh I used butter.  I did have lard but it was frozen.  Now, next goal is to get them round.  😂
Hey Mama, I tried this last night- the dough was a dream but when I rolled out and cooked them they were kind of hard. I don’t know if I cooked them too long or what!
Thank you so much.  Love the two videos. I’ve made twice and the 2nd batch was better. But not like yours.  YET. still coming out hard.
Where was this last night! I followed your first tortilla video last night and I had some issues. I found this one today and followed it for some breakfast tacos and wow! They came out so much better. I didn’t get a lot of bubbles so I’m going to work on it more and see what else I can do. Texture and flavor was great though!
OK vamos a ver cómo sale 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣❤️‍🔥 Wish me luck
Home made step by step is best if I want fast food ill go to McDonald's lol thank you for doing step by step I appreciate a good tortilla 😋
Thank you so much for taking the time to show every step this helps me understand better
you weigh out the ingredients the same way chipotle scrapes all the guac off my scoop
Hi, do you have a idea how to make soft tortillas with wheat flour??
Great video. Thanks so very much, you answered so many questions.
Thank you for explaining the recipe and with such detail! I really enjoy being able to follow your technique!
This dough was my first ever successful one made. Awesome recipe and tutorial thanks for sharing!!
You are so kind and sweet for making a detailed video. I saw your first one and thought it was well done.
Wow, you went through a lot of trouble there, will defo give this a try - Thanks
I can't wait to try your recipe, I love a nice warm tortilla right off the grittle.  I spread some butter on it and eat it just like that.  Or dip one in my chicken noodle soup.  Yum yum.  I will try making some with your recipe.  Mine turn out looking like a frisbee or looking and tasting like a saltine cracker.  I gave up trying a long time ago.   But now I'm going to get up enough energy to try making them again.  It most of been at least 45 years ago when I tried the last time.   Thank you again for your nice video.
Made them today, they came out great. Excellent recipe and show of technique, thank you!
I'm a very good cook and baker, but tortillas have not been something I have mastered.  I just now ( in Feb. 2022) tried your recipe. And while mine never did bubble, they turned out absolutely soft and delicious ! The dough was so  very easy to work with, like satin !  Thank you ! I can now say I can make wonderful, soft tortillas !
Am going to make these for dinner tonight. Not mile high in altitude but close.
I tried like this with oil.but not perfectly come.not like this.
Yum  so good 👏🏼💯😍
I grew up in Albuquerque, NM and naturally, fell in love with Spanish/Mexican foods.  I have been in NC for many years and have never been able to find a good sopapilla recipe.  A few years ago, I went back home to visit my BFF.  Her little boy would beg her to make him butter tortillas and she'd flip them strait on the gas burner lol.  Do you have a sopapilla recipe here?  I can't find it and I want to make meat stuffed sopapillas instead of just honey ones.  Thank you for your videos.  I love watching you as you are so down to earth.
Hi there I love your channel and your cooking. I followed your recipe for making tortillas the flavor is good but they never come out as soft as yours. You gave us a tip and it said if you can stretch it real thin without tearing that’s a good dugh but what if it is not a good dough, do we let it rest longer?
Everytime I'm looking for some good ways to cook up some mexican food I always find myself coming to this channel cant help it😋
I was tired of store-bought tortillas more commonly referred to as wraps in Germany that I decided to make my own.  This video is exactly what I needed as it is very informative, very well made with the great written recipe in grams.  Thank you.
I followed exactly your instructions by weighing my flour , etc. My dough was nice, supple and stretchy. Let it rest for 15 minutes covered with plastic in a bowl, then divided it into 8 balls. Let it rest again for 10 minutes.  Flattened my dough into 8 inches circle, laid each flattened dough on a a medium hot frying pan one at a time. Each one of them cracked and was not soft. Any advise?
I know you’re getting enough comments with questions. Im going to try this out tomorrow, should i have done corn tortillas before that turned out perfectly. Can i use a tortilla press or will it stick and not work as well as rolling it out?
Love your food!  $Liyahwyatt4525
Can we use something else besides lard
💞💞👍
Nice recipe. Your voice is so pleasant with that tinge of laughter. One thing though, doesn't flipping them over and over make them tough or dry, they should cook quickly because they are very thin.
I followed them..I used oil version..they came out fantastic 😁 thank you 😊
Where can I get a mixing bowl like yours?. I love it.
You are exactly correct about letting the tortilla dough rest on the side of the bowl. I even just let them rest on the counter, if space permits, and yes they seem to puff beautifully! Good video. I was in the restaurant business for 40 + years and recognize when a cook works with love .
pls can i cook in my oven insead
Why baking powder though...
Can the dough be made a head of time and then used as needed and if so how long can it be stored?
Yumm! I made this. Thanks you for helping. I used butter
A standing ovation for this Simply Mama Cook's flour tortilla recipe.  Her measurements are with out fail, precise!  This is the best flour tortilla recipe.  Absolutely excellent.  Thank you for sharing your culinary talent, expertise and delectable recipes.  I am a follower and subscriber and as a Latino am proud to support your channel. Gracias.
How do i freeze them? Should I cook them first? Or should i freeze the dough balls?
?????????????
,
Thank you so much for such simple instructions 💙
What makes tortillas Crack ours didn't taste right first time Daughter and I did it
Nothing better than seeing those bubbles.  My mom always said, if you get bubbles, you’re doing something right!
Son helping mama in the kitchen. Gonna be a better man for it. 💪
Thank you! Four videos in and I finally got it. My first issue I was rolling out the dough, I was rolling them to thick. The tortillas need to be paper thin.  And then I had the heat too high. On my gas stove it needed to be on medium. And the tortillas only need to be on one side for about as long as an egg. And then immediately flip it and then take it out. the whole process  should take about 20 seconds, at least that’s how it was for me and I’ve got perfect tortillas now.
Loved it, thank you for sharing 😊
You are a superb teacher.  Very well done video.  Thank you
Just made these amd my goodness they are so delicious, thank you!
Do you have the weight of the flour ? Thank you.
After 20 yrs of asking I'm finally able to use lard
My tortilla didnt puff and got hard 😭 only 2 came out okay. I will try again but any advice?
So, this is reeeeeally interesting: You SAY in your video that 3 cups of flour is equal to 384 grams. Your WRITTEN list of ingredients says 400 grams of flour. I weighed 3 cups of flour at the neighborhood pulperia (small Latin American store) and came up with 300 grams! And googling  "weight in grams of 1 cup of AP flour" results in 150 grams/cup of flour, which is equal to 450 grams of flour in three cups! I think I have just lost any faith I had in the idea that weighing ingredients is more accurate that using measuring cups/spoons.
I weigh everything. Thanks for your extra work to give us the weights. It really makes a difference. I am in my 70's and just measured my whole life and that was a shot in the dark. In the last two years I started weighing my ingredients and it really makes a difference. Again, thank you.
Just as a note. 7 minutes on a stand mixer is waaaay too much. Probably more like 3-5 because it is kneading much faster than you can.   Also I really like your kneading technique. Looks wonderful for a knuckle cracker like myself 😂
The best tortillas ever.  They brought back fond childhood memories of our Mexican neighbors teaching me to cook authentic Mexican!  We had a lot of fun in the kitchen.  I think my favorite way to eat a tortilla was a simple tortilla with a whole jalapeño in the center, rolled, warmed, and enjoy!  Thank you so much for your recipe!
THOSE... ARE... BEAUTIFUL! Thanks for all the details. I  just found your channel.
No written instructions???
One thing I have noticed and gotten results from doing is.........................when you think they rolled thin enough, they are not. You can almost see through hers, that bit helped me a lot.
I made 10 and only 4 came out great, but thankfully those 4 were the last 4! So it's a lot of trial and error and takes practice.
17 min video on how to make tortilla 😱😱😱😱😱 I'm out
This was such a beautiful satisfying video. thank you for posting. I plan on trying this on my next meal prep day
came out great, thanks for the recipe :)
So informative! I made them from a random recipe online and couldn’t figure out what I was doing wrong. I didn’t knead the dough like  that 🤦🏻‍♀️  great tips!!
I know this is from some years ago but with the warmest grateful thanks Mama you may have saved me from a life of Store bought Tortillas.  I saw a recipe that I liked which required Tortillas and my practice is to buy them, keep them in the Fridge till they are unfit to eat and then throw them away. But I saw a recipe which looked good and was waiting for the Tortillas  -  but they didn't have any (On-Line grocery order). So I decided to  ---  make my own. Naturally this involves a Google Search. Strange ingredient came up Humf. Amazon had something resembling but not to my reluctant cooks eyes, exact. Then your video came up - this one - at last - something understandable and with ordinary ingredients. I do not need Gordon Ramsay quality (I like GR's recipes btw, only the very basic of which I would be able to do) so this I will attempt. I was trying just now to remember what the recipe was I had intended to do (I am mid 70s, it happens often - I think?) - success a Ques- something of other. I am English - what do you expect!!!
Thank you. As I'm watching you handle the dough I can say that my dough looks exactly the same texture. I ended up with 700 g total of dough and divided by 14 that was 50 g dough balls. They are happily resting under Saran wrap right now on a silicone mat
I love watching your channel. I've learned so much. Mexican is my favorite food and I have come to like it so much better when I use your recipes. I made flour tortillas for the 1st time and will never go back to store bought ;) thank you!
The first time I made tortillas they looked like the state of Texas and Florida. But the more you do it the better you get.
Love your recipe! Will the dough keep if I refrigerate half overnight?
Why is it that everyone who does Mexican recipes speak perfect English and then throw that Spanish accent when saying 'tortilla'?
Thank you for the wonderfull tortlla
I'm watching you mix your dough in the bowel, my mom always said if your bowel comes out clean like your did, you know you have a great dough.   Yours looks so beautiful.  I bet your tortillas are awesome too.
Used your recipe and tips for my spanish lesson today. We had so much fun. And this was by far the best tips I've used to make tortillas. Deliciosas!
Hi. Where can I purchase the mixing bowl. Thanks (There are too many comments to go through to see if you answered anyone. I found one reply to this question, but it was from someone else.) Thank you.
You be you girl! I can't believe the negative comments in the original video, especially the comment about how you say tortilla!!! You are teaching us how to make delicious food. If some people can't seem to grasp the concept, they just need to keep buying the store bought tortillas, that's all they deserve. I believe that cooking involves a lot of feel and intuition, which comes with experience! You can't watch one video and expect everything to come out perfect. It takes time to perfect the feel and instinct that comes with experience. If it doesn't come out the way you expected the first time then you try again. Change one thing at a time, more water less water, more fat, less fat, more kneading, less kneading etc... Try to half the ingredients, so your not wasting time and money. I love your videos and technique! I bought your cookbook, and love it... Thank you!
thanks for sharing tortilla recipe in a very easy way...
Everything went perfect for me until I cooked them on an electric griddle. Not hot enough. Next time I will use my cast iron. Thank you so much
Can we store them, if yes for how many days  and any specific instructions
Thank you very much ! Enjoy ... Great information .
Thank you.  You are very kind to teach me.  May God bless you and yours.
Mine won't raise, won't bubble no matter what I do and come out really hard. Tried it twice andy tortillas just won't come out fluffy and soft. What could I be doing wrong? :(
Thank you for this clear and detailed recipe... so easy to follow
Is there any substitute for using lard?
13:59 that was a magnificent outcome ❤️
Tried it tonight they came out so soft and nice thanks for video
I live in the PHX metro area so it is very dry here. I have noticed I need a little more water and I add it a small bit at a time, otherwise it'll become way too wet.
Can you use tortilla press?
🤤🤤🤤💦💦💦 these were Bussin OMG
Hi! The best recipe yet! But mine doesn't bubble as much as yours...What could it be?? Thank you! Love from Brazil
Thank you for not speeding up!! It really helped me!!!
Loved not fast forwarding and enjoyed watching your hands work the masa. With three sisters (I’m the youngest) we had to learn to make tortillas each one of us at age 11. But before that I adored watching my mom making tortillas, she’d constantly say go outside and play your time to learn will come. But it was so comforting to watch her just as it was watching you in your video. My mom specified that I could watch her do it but I shouldn’t watch my older sisters make them so that I wouldn’t pick up bad habits or incorrect details so until she taught me herself my sisters didn’t have an audience. Even though growing up we each took turns every day making them for the family my sisters stopped when they graduated high school. I continue to make them often but I still like watching them being made. My 90 yr old mom doesn’t make them due to her arthritis but she says I still make them just like hers. Watch and learn 🥰
This is the most helpful video ever, thank you so much! I’m gonna try and make these tonight 😊
Thanks you!!  I want to try.
I like its
Hi Mama! I just made your recipe, truly yummy they are soft not hard like my flour tortillas lol .I used butter I  didn’t have lard. I fallowed your video until it was finished it was worth it.Thank you LOVED video .❤️😀
😋😍
This is just what I've wanted! Thank you! :)
I've made some from the first video and my dough did come out a little tough and not tacky. I'm going to try and fluff my flour and baking powder to see if my dough comes out much softer. My goal is to definitely get them softer like how my grandma use to make them. I love your videos and how precise you are with measurements. Thank you for this video and like you said practicing continually does help. I wish I could have watched and help my grandma more with her recipes. My grandma used to make the best chicken mole, I don't remember her recipe. I was wondering if you could do a video on chicken mole. I've watched so many different youtube videos but I see alot of folks using so many different ingredients although nothing is wrong with that; I just remember my grandma only using a few. Always a pleasure watching your videos
One day I will perfect these lol. Thank you!
Hopefully this info will help others. I used EXACTLY the same batch and got 2 completely different result. The first would not wrap and cracked like a cracker - very off-putting . The second was PERFECT!  The difference? The 1st tortillas would not bubble and took a while to cook. I assumed the lack of bubbles was due to the fact that baking powder was years out of date - nope! For the second batch I put the dough in the fridge for about 5 hours (as I needed them later). When I rolled them out they were at fridge temperature. I made them as thin as I could, probably about 1/2 as thin as the original one. I had the pan as hot as it would go, which I suspect is a lot less hot than Mama's hob top temperature. They bubbled up perfectly! They also cooked much quicker.   If you compared the first and the second tortilla you'd have thought they were from a completely different batch or had different ingredients. I hope this info helps others.
Will they still be OK is you pre-prepare the dough balls in the morning and then keep them in the fridge for the evening? And can you freeze them rolled out? Is so cooked or uncooked?
Mine don’t rise and they are dry not supple
lol I like the sassiness when explaining "this is how you do it when im not weeeiiiigghhhinggg out ingredients" and all the multiple times she mentions that she is remaking it. some people must have been salty in the last video hahahaha.
Thanks for the great recipe. Can you freeze the tortillas?
Can you store these and maintain the softness??
Biden is providing every border crosser with a spatula.
I make them all the time and they come out grea every time!!! My brother in law follows your recipe and he loves it. If you follow the instructions is not dry at all, best tortilla recipe ever!!!!
Excellent video and recipe! Thank you so much for sharing.💕
I've  never made tortillas  in my life, growing  up my mom made them all the time, I'll  be 60  on the 11th  and I've  missed my mom's  tortillas, I've  bought  them at the store but they never taste  like my mom's  she passed in 1988, I saw your video  a few days ago and tonight  I made them, an omg.... they tastes  like my mom's  tortillas  I had a few tears of memories  but thank you so very much for sharing  the recipe. May God Bless You.
Looks good. I will try to make it. I am subscribed.  Thanks for making this video.
I want to thank you for this recipe. I have tried many recipes over the years and none have come close to my grandmas. I weighed everything and they came out exactly tasting like my grandma’s tortillas. I haven’t had one for over 20+ years but these took me back to my childhood and back to her kitchen. I used to love being woken up by the sound of the rolling pin and the smell of tortillas on the comal. I miss her everyday. Thank you for giving me this to pass on to my grandkids. Have a blessed day
Do you know the approximate weight of the dough balls? Thanks for clarifying all the steps.
Thank you so much !!
Once the dough balls are made and rested, can they be frozen and after the tortillas are cooked and cooled, can they be frozen? I only need to make a few tortillas at a time.
I cant make circles from the balls to save my life.😫
If it doesn't bubble up what can I do to fix it?
Cant wait to make thank you for a perfectly detailed recipe!
You’ve explained the process so much better than my momma😂 I’ve been trying to learn it from her for years, but she never uses measurements & does everything too fast for me🤣 I miss her tortillas now that I’ve moved I out, so your video has been a life saver😭
Tried out the recipe.. success! Muchas gracias! I'll send you the video of them in a bit!  ❤T.I.T. TejanosinTaiwan ❤
Thank you SO much for keeping "real time" in the video.  It really helped me understand what was happening.
How hot is the wateŕ
Tortilis are simply rotis or chapatis which we make in India.We make them everyday both in the morning and in the evening and the only difference is that they are made up of maida or all purpose flour whereas we make them of whole wheat flour.
How many grams per dough ball? For the life of me I can’t make them but I determined with your help.
My tortillas look trannslucent, anyone know why?
You are so awesome!!! Thank you for your videos. ❤️
I just finished doing these tortillas and they came out good! The only thing is that mine didn't fluff as much as yours did. Why do you think that is?
Hi mama. Using your same recipe. Is it possible to bake your tortillas? Can you please give me your advice? Thank you your show and your recipes are amazing.
Ok 7 more minutes rest for the balls then I start rollin! Thanks so much for the help! I love measurements 🧡 now back to the chimichanga's (sorry I butchered that spelling!) video! Thanks for a great dinner idea 👍 the chicken mixture smells delicious 😋
Could you please make enchiladas?!!! Please....
Watching someone kneading dough is very meditative.  So is the tuck 'n' turn.  Thank you for taking the time to demonstrate.
Any changes for high altitude, 6000ft..
Thank you so much for this video 🥺 I tried your older one and yes the tortillas definitely came out dry and hard with no elasticity
🙏💫👍🇺🇸🇨🇱 Girl that is awesome! 👍
I really enjoy to see how you work all the way with the dough, Thank you for sharing your recipe, today I made two different recipes, , I have been married for 40 years, and cooking every day, but Flower tortillas, no, My Mom was EXPERT, she made it every day for more then 60 years, but for me, in my experience the firs time was not well, Then I stop trying. se ven riquísimas
First time I made it from your video I dusted the needing surface and they turned out like pitas haha. I’m tryin it again right now
Great video on tortilla making.🤗 But... Pllleeezzzz Change the tunes...... Sounds like a broken record, withe the same tune playing over and over and over and over and over and over and over... it's enuf to make  a sane person nuts! Otherwise 😋 you've got a good video.👍.
Thank you for sharing your recipe looks delicious and very good explanation. I’m your new friend 👍🎆
I love your recipe and method of describing as you go along. Best ever! I’m from India and use to making rotis, parathas which are also cooked on skillets. now I can even use your recipe to make Bhatures, a deep fried version of pooris! Can’t wait to make my own homemade tortillas!
Are you still doing baking oh and I love love love this video
Thanks so much I'm making these today
Beautifully explained.
Awesome, I’m going to try these with spelt flour because I don’t eat wheat or corn. Or would chickpea flour be better?
Just made it. Never buying store tortillas again! Used Crisco, and they're delicious.
I used this same recipe in New Mexico, at 7800 feet in the mountain meadows of God’s Country! O, the tortillas; how wonderfully light and airy!!! Have fun with blessings of Our Lord and Lady, Most Holy Mother Mary, beside you always! Happy Holy Days 2020 and a Blessed New Year!
Thank you, this is how I like to see recipes with precise measurements.
Yay about to go make some now 😁 thank you
Nice homemade tortillas. Good job mama❤️
Gracias for the detailed video. Las tortillas came out great!
Hi mama I just made some flour tortillas but they were a little to hard.
Made using this recipe. Mine turned out snappy instead of soft and barely puffed. Oh well.
I can answer your high altitude question if you dont mind.....i use 1tsp baking powder, 1/3 cup oil and depending on how dry it is, use more water a tablespoon at a time until the consistency is right. We’re at 6000 ft. I have a few high altitude recipes on my channel but not tortillas....yet! Mom’s from San Diego but dad brought her here to Colorado.  We make lots of tortillas!
Hi there - lovely tortillas but just curious why to use baking soda? Thanks...
Thank you so much! I’m slowly learning how to make tortillas because of your video. I’ve tried to follow so many videos, I’ve asked family members and finally this is the one for me! Of course I have good and bad tortilla days but if it weren’t for you it wouldn’t be possible at all. I appreciate you so much! ❤️
😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝
No lard , coconut oil is wayyyyy better
Hey girl I grews up on. The Tex/Mex borddeer n all over. Mexico. Still my favorite type of food...I am an old gringo and. Getting back into mex cooking. Ive seen women stretch ad pat out the dough balls and also use a  roller.. I have a beautiful Vuctoria/ Corona tortilla press I use making my corn torrtillas. I pllan to use it to make flour tortillas. Any comment? Aksso have you done aa vvideo makiing Soppapias ??  Thanks
So you won't sound so Mexican and backward  on your recipe no offense be mad I'm trying to help
You need to do some culinary research on your measurements annual learn how to measure professionally
My mom dunks the dough in flour before rolling them out. Now I know why hers are so hard.
This was a great tutorial with the most helpful information. Thank you. I noticed you didnt flip them from hand to hand and pat them. My meemaw always did that when making her tortillas. Does it make a difference?
They look sooooooo delicious my mouth was watering. I have to try your recipe!
How long do these stay fresh for and can they be frozen?
The first video was good. My tortilla's came out yummy! I'm going to try this one! ☺
hello how can i store flour tortilla? hoping for a response thank you ☺
Sadly my tortillas turned hard😢
Sorry mam do u use warm water or cold
I just watched a video before I found yours and what a  hot mess that was. She used too much water and had to knead her dough for ever.
You are amazing!! Can't believe you refilmed it again for people didn't get it right. Made some from your first video and was a huge hit! Thank you again!
You are in so much trouble now Mama!!! Since I started to make this, only tortillas my husband wants is your homemade tortillas 🤣 He won’t buy them in store anymore. They are so delicious!!! Thanks for sharing. ❤️
I’m inspired to try again! Mine were not as pliable last time but definitely edible
Love the HEART you put in your this video! Also, you went beyond the pale! Thank You! You’re the best❣️
Looks odd! You don’t have spatula?! Not good.
Thanks mamma. These are the real deal. Im from South Texas and grew up with them. Still one of my favorite bread priducts.
Why does that " bowl" look likena collinder??
where did you get the bowl?
Help! Mine don't bubble like urs 1😭
My dough came out sticky like and after rolling them out, I couldn’t get them out of my hands! What did I do wrong? Everything was so sticky ugh.... 🤨
I made these with dehydrated green onion you thank you
I have tried making these twice.  I rolled them out paper thin and they still do not bubble.  They taste good but they do not bubble?  They are edible and not a waste.  I put them in a super hot dry pan too.  Thanks for this!
Fantastic video- great instruction!!
I’ve had these last more than 24 hours. Store them in an airtight container. Steam them and they are still so good!!! If my family was bigger, or if we were not in covid and I had friends over they obviously would not last! This has been one of my favorite covid go to recipes!!! Haven’t bought tortillas since! 💕
thank you for sharing ma'am, I will try too, keep safe, God bless
Thanks for sharing this video again I watch the first one I don't know which one was first cuz I didn't really pay attention to the date but this time you measured everything out I do notice that but thanks so much for sharing it I will like I said be making these tortillas just saying
I used the veggie oil and really liked it and it had a good taste for so little ingredients! Thank you so so much for sharing, I appreciate it! 🥰
you measure flour wrong! You fluff it then pack it down scooping it with the measure cup. If you're going to make a how to video then maybe you should learn the proper way to measure
Maybe what I do wrong is I dont add enough water or maybe I knead too long to the point the water gets dry ?
Thank you so much for teaching me how to make authentic tortillas. They're so delicious and fluffy. I did notice in this video you state 384 grams of flour but in the printed recipe it shows 400 grams for the 3 cups of flour. I've done both and the 384 grams makes fluffier tortillas. I am at nearly 1000 foot elevation and following your recipe in this video gave a great result. I missed learning this from my grandmother as we were a military family and never lived close to her. I know she sent you to me...thank you! By the way, I made 14 instead of 12 tortillas. I think it's because we have small hands.
This is by far the BEST tortilla recipe on Internet!!
I want to make a commercial one please and I want it a bit hard.how do I do that please, thanks
Can I call you please?
Your last video was perfect which is why I had to see why on earth you did a second one but everyone understands differently lol thanks my family loves it. I make them for breakfast now like my abuela use to for me.
I will be a married women because of this video haha
Thanks for this other video. Helps that you modified it a bit. Will give it a third try since my last two batches came out dry and I used very little flour.   Big hopes.  Thanks.
Hi!  I'm really enjoying your videos.  You said we could use any kind of fat, butter, shortening, etc,... Could I use the fat from cooking a pork butt for tamales?  I like to stick the juices in the fridge and let the fat raise to the top and solidify.  Would that work?  I hate to waste!
Recipe  plz
So much ilove it tortillas
Like it toetella
Took me one time to burn my finger trying to flip a tortilla to switch over to spatula method.
Thanks so much for slowing things down. You helped to encourage me, a beginner who loves flour tortillas
Just found your page and I found your video so helpful.  I typed up some notes based on your instructions and I am saving this to my recipe book.
Still struggling.  My dough keeps coming out very hard. I don't know what i am doing wrong
Thank you!!!!
thank you so much❣️
I did not enjoy this recipe. I am not a fan of making tortillas homemade. It's not the same as the store, homemade come out burnt or doughy and it's a waste of dinero, or money. You worked hard to share this, have to give you that, but this no bueno is the nicest thing I can say about my experience. I'd rather stick to what I know and love.
This video is 2 years old... here i am quarantined learning how to make tortillas along with other recipes u have my husband is loving it and my mother in law thinks i know how to cook . Thank you!😅
Hi! I don't usually comment on videos, but I just have to say I think you are amazing!! Your kids and your husband are so lucky to have you. Your style of cooking remind me of how Grandmas used to cook everything from scratch. I love how you are not wasteful and the way you patiently teach us all with your tips and advice along the way. I have just recently discovered your channel and I have suscribed!! Thank you so much for sharing your recipes and skills with us all. You are a beautiful and generous spirit and just an awesome person!!
Don't sell yourself short.  You're a pro. Just like my mom makes. She grew up in a Rancho in Zacatecas
My mom never used measurements it was just quessing them and her tortillas always came out so good. Me on the other hand I need measurements lol.
Hihi,  a little question here🙈 why does my tortilla turns out brittle and I can’t fold them.  My country have high humidity, I wonder if it is related. Or Is it because I add too little water or I did not knead the dough enough or they have been heated on the pan for too long?🙏🏻🙏🏻
The only question that I have that isn’t answered in your video is, how do you best store these?
REALLY great real time video, mostly no music and great narration, it’s why I subscribe to you 😊 much appreciated. Cheers from Australia 🐨
Handy style of baking powder can, I wish we had that brand here in Australia.
Cant wait to try this :)  Thank you
What if you do all the steps and measurements correctly and it is still sticky?
Made these last night.  Man they came out delicious.  You are my NEW go to  recipe page.
Omgoodness one day my tortillas will come out like this to someday😁💜💜💜
Very particular with the way you make tortillas. I guarantee they are amazing though!
I like a ratio of 4:1 flour to water. Perfect every batch
Hello..i live in a high altitude ares in northern italy and i can say...the recipe worked amazingly for me...i followed the weight measure to a T and the dough is extremely perfect and workable. So i also made your mexican rice ...i gently panfried my onions, then chopped garlic, a teaspoon of cumin and 2 chicken stockcubes until all aromas were released ..i added a quarter cup of tomato passata...and simmered/reduced it down...added it tomy soaking basmati rice in my rice cooker and that too, turned out beautiful....so for dinner, ill open a can of corn,  can of black beans..the mexican rice and some sour cream all wrapped in the tortillas for dinner !  Thanks so much for the recipes..your recipes have always been no fail for me...lot of love from Italy, Samantha  ❣💟❣🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹
How do I double this recipe?
I got 14 doe balls. I'm over floured by such a little bit but it all makes a difference.
gonna try enchilada mix.  The restarant style is too red. Mom used to make is using chili powder, four, lard, water...it was so good she would put the corn tortillas right in the pan, pull them out then roll them!
My kneading time is not even three minutes but it feels right, maybe just a little tough. that tells me its a flour issue. I have a strong grip so the kneading is less.  It doesn't rise that much while it sets. Is it suppose to?
I added half spoon of salt extra and it still tasted just a little floury...still good, but I know it can be better, so ill take out some of the flour.  Im doing the lose measurement but I will be move observant.  What brand of flour do you prefer
I will be giving your recipe a try soon. I did get me a Tortilla Press. Thank you for sharing with us. God Bless You and Your Family.
Cannot wait for your cookbook!😋🍱🍝🍜
Thank you so much for this awesome recipe! We made these tonight and they were sooooo good! I have tried a handful of times to make flour tortillas and the results were always disappointing.  I really appreciate how you take the time to explain everything. Thanks again and we are looking forward to trying more of your recipes!
I love your recipes.  I just made a half recipe of these tortillas and they are delicious.  I also made your chocolate mud cake recipe last week—best chocolate cake I’ve ever eaten!
Thank you Thank you 😊
I just made these and they turned out great, thank you it was super easy to make.
How would you make it with regular flour?    Do you have a recipe.
I have been making this recipe for a couple of years. I have found that if you measure each dough ball to 2 ounces each you will get thirteen equally sized tortillas. Best recipe! I favor making mine with ghee.
I followed your recipe and instructions and my tortillas came out tough. What did i do wrong?
I ❤️ your recipes! Homemade are always best specially when you make fish tacos and your 23 yr old eats 10 tacos 🤦🏽‍♀️ well any how. I have 6 kids, everyone eats a lot can I make ahead and refrigerate? And what is the best way to store them?
Ok, I’m from uk and not used to “cups” and such, the unit so favoured by folks of the US. I understand there is a mission to make things simple with weights and measures. But please allow a small plea from me... provide all measures in, the extremely simple, SI units of measure. The international weights and measures standard  is remarkably simple. It’s just two units. Grams and litres.  By all means mention your tablespoons and teaspoons and cups and quarts and pints and pounds and ounces, but please provide the equivalent g’s and l’s. Can you see a teaspoon is so vague? Is it heaped, levelled or “about right”? A simple way of solving the confusion is... grams. I know what a pint looks like but quarts left the uk years ago. Fluid ounces are what? You guys have so many units!!!!  Please don’t shout - I have google to help with conversions/translation. I’m just suggesting that those two simple measures of weight and volume: gram and litre, can really help to communicate exactly what you are talking about!  Remember, one person’s teaspoon is another persons heaped teaspoon.
Hai mama.. may i know.. how long i can keep this cooked tortilla at refrigerator??
Thank you 😊♥️
I’ve tried this recipe at least 5 times and they come out hard all the time I’ve tried it all step by step... God forbid my life ever depends on me getting this right
Mine don't get bubbles they stay flat. What am I doing wrong?
Thank you for sharing your skills, I have always wanted to learn to make tortillas!
Can u make these ahead and freeze them....after cooking or before
Hi i have a question why does my tortilla shrink when i roll it out???
Is there a way to to have the torilla like pre made for later 🤔 without it tasting old .
I followed your first video and these came out GREAT.  It is now a favorite in our household... we don’t buy tortillas now.... so THANK YOU THANK YOU. 👍🏽
Thank you for this video, Can you keep the dough in the fridge if you can't use it all? & for how long?
I absolutely love kneading dough - and I had no idea watching someone else knead dough would be so satisfying LOL - can't wait to make these. Your soft corn tortillas are such a hit in my house that I can't keep up with demand, so I'm gonna add these to the rotation.
So easy to make, and your comments and video are great!  I don’t usually knead by hand, but this dough is easy to work. I use a scale, I make challah bread and weigh everything as well.  I got 15 tortillas- divided the dough by weight,. I tried the rolling pin, but the dough is so easy to work with that I used the heel of my hand to shape it and it worked well for me.  I only wish you would  add how to keep these once they are made, so they stay soft.  I looked it up, but I think that would be helpful.  If anyone has trouble making the balls, find a challah recipe (Jamie Geller) and they show you how- not difficult.  Thank you!
Hey they are exactly like Indian Chapatis .
Lol, mine have been like pie dough last 2 times, probably too dry.
Hi, these look so good my stomach is growling. I could just eat them with a glass of milk. I do have arthritis in my hands and I can't knead the dough for that long, so how long would I have to knead it in my stand mixer to get the right texture?  Thanks for your help and for sharing your wonderful recipe 💚🥀🐴 Oh... I would love to hear a beautiful Spanish ballad, played on a guitar, in the background...if you don't mind 😁 God bless you real good 💚🥀 🌿 Sorry, I just now got to 5:00 in the video, you answered my question, thanks again
Hi mija this my first time to watch you from Schulenburg, Texas I really enjoyed your video and I did not fast forward it my mom used to make her tortillas like you and that's how I make them too thank you for sharing God bless you and your family ❤
I did your recipe and it’s amazing
Can you mix them in a processor to activate a gluten?
What a great video! I made these today and the first few came out brittle and hard but after a bit of trouble shooting with rolling out the balls and playing with the heat under the pan they started to come out beautifully pliable and soft. I've been trying on and off for years to make soft tortillas and they always came out brittle, every time it happened I just told myself to stick to cooking and stay away from flour based recipes which always come out wrong. Thank you so much for showing me finally how to cross this one of my list!!
I bake bread 2 or 3 times a week and always hand knead.  You've got great dough skills, beautiful.  I used this recipe to make tortillas for brisket burritos.  I always do brisket burritos on the 4th, but this was the first time I made my own flour tortillas.
i just don't understand why 393 viewers gave you a thumbs down.. they must be miserable people who are super jealous of remarkable gifted people like you. I can hear your kindness  through your voice.  My best to you always little lady.  Thank you for your informative videos!
Can you do these the day before, after kneading and dividing the dough into balls and place in the fridge overnite to make the next day? Or better yet can you roll them out and place parchment paper between each one and cook the next day?
These are so, so tasty! When the tortillas are warm they taste just like the ones Disney used to sell at the Tortilla Factory. Brought back so many happy memories. :)
Why did you do the tucking so many times??? Is that required additional kneading... If so how many times or for how many minutes should it be done???? Thanks
Woohoo another King Arthur Flour fan in the house!!! I loved the video, very self explanatory. 👌🏼
No more buying tortillas Going to make them now! Thank you so much!
Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. Just tried making it and it turned out really well.
I just made your recipe for my wifes birthday and they are amazing. First time trying flour tortillas. Thank you so much for sharing, but now I’m being told I will be making more a lot more often 😎😂
IM A NEWBIE MAKING TORTILLAS, BUT YOUR TUTORIAL VIDEO TAUGHT ME WELL & I AM ENCOURAGED TO MAKE MY OWN...  THANK YOU ~ THANK YOU ~ THANK YOU - AND -  🙏 GOD BLESS YOU & YOUR FAMILY 😋  :) Diane <><
Delicious and super soft. Thank you for sharing
Thank you for this helpful tutorial. I made these tortillas alongside a different recipe and these were the clear winner! I'm adding these to my list of recipes.
I can't tell you how many time's I watched your first video and never tried to make tortillas but now I have everything ready and resting and fixing to throw down on the griddle wish me luck lol hope they turn out as beautiful as yours thank you for the recipe
I have problems with my right hand and cant really do the "tuck and turn" will this affect the taste or texture of the tortillas?
Even though this video was posted a year ago. Out of every tutorial I have watch to learn how to make tortillas de Mano ... this specific video I have finally achieved a soft great tasting tortilla 🥰🥰
¡Gracias Tía! I’m a young Latina and spent most of my adolescents raised in white foster families, so I’ve  recently been trying to teach myself how to cook and learn these recipes that I missed when I was younger. I’m so grateful for these videos like yours to cook along with and can’t wait to make more recipes!
So for 24 tortillas  it will be double ingredientes?
hola mama k ricas tortillas❤️
You do a wonderful job of explaining your videos! I haven't made them in many years and I could never get them to come out right. So, I'm on a mission, now that I found you. Thank you! BTW, I live in Colorado at a high altitude. The best flour is Hungarian because it is made for high altitude!
Oh my goodness mommas these look so amazing. I am for sure trying this recipe ❤❤❤
Thank you so much for taking your time explaining the proses of making tortillas,I try with other recipe but they are not as clear as you. Thank you for taking your time and showing how is the best way to make them. And your explanation is clear. Thank you I hope you can make more stuff and share.
I made these and although they were delicious they didn’t bubble when I cook them and some came out a little harder than I would’ve liked but I put them in a tortilla warmer and they all got really soft so not sure what I did wrong I guess it takes practice.
Why did she save the paper towel
verry nice . thanks for your sharing your recipes
Thank you for this tutorial. It helped me tremendously!
I made these today! Turned out really well. Only thing is. I don’t think I put enough salt. It was bland.
Fantastic tutorial clearly explained
Hey, I’m so new to all of this but I love Mexican food so I have been looking for days for a great recipe and I keep coming back to yours. I’m having a huge problem though. I cannot for the life of me find the pint options so that I can print and keep this recipe so I will have it for the future. PLEASE!!!PLEASE!!!PLEASE HELP ME!!!! Thanks
After watching the video I can tell you that it was very informational. I kind of had an idea of how to make these floor tortillas. But what impressed me the most was how eloquent the lady was. I meant I can tell this lady has taught a class in the past. And her voice had a very nice tone kind of like a school teacher. Thank you for the video and keep up the good job.
Me gustan como enseñas las medidas de tu abuela si la gente no sabe medir. Y todo lo que cocine me salió. Con toda la palabra.  "A toda Madre." Gracias cocinas  Requereriquisimo. Love your channel.  👍😜😜🤗🤗😋😋😋😛
Hi Maria tried your recipe butter tortillas . oh so yummy and thank you for the recipe .
I really enjoy following you. We seem to think a like I think lol. I like food science or how things work etc. Can you help? My tortillas didn't fluff. I know it could be many factors too much flour etc.... how should I store raw dough? Once I remove it from the fridge how long should I let the masa sit out?
I did step by step from your recipe. Mines came horrible and so hard.
without going thru all one million comments, LOL, I'm curious as to about what heat is your cast iron pan when you cook the tortillas?  thanks.
Yee, out-of-Big-Texas, Haw! Success in making 13, almost perfect THIN, soft taco sized flour tortillas thanks to @SimplyMamaCooks excellent teaching videos. You’re the absolute best. I’m over 82+ and these are the very first flour tortillas I’ve made. By the way, since this was my first attempt, I weighed out each dough ball at 50 grams except for the 13th, it was 54 grams. Used my fabulous KitchenAid stand mixer, worked great at making the dough smooth and pliable. Also weighed each of the ingredients in grams and ml. Your excellent recipe is a real keeper. Many thanks for your generous time and kindness. 🙏🏼♥️😎💃🏼💥🎉🎊🎈. I now have enough flour tortillas to last me for almost 2 weeks. I love making one egg breakfast burritos with soft taco size flour tortillas. Yesterday, I made 14 perfect soft corn tortillas, Gave 10 of them to a Border Patrol Agent friend who’s helped me a few times over the years I’ve been here. Had 2 of my 4 to make little bacon, egg, homemade refried bean and cheese breakfast tacos today.
Mine is so tuff
Thank you..I tried your recipe.but the tortillas wraps just went like flakey...what can I use to make them chewy please
I made these they taste great and are soft but they didn’t puff up, they’re flat. I don’t know what I did wrong, I followed you exactly. Help please!
;
What is the name of the song at the end of the video? thanks
Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.  I didn't realize until today that you re-filmed it.  I stumbled upon your original video when looking for flour tortilla recipe for dinner because we aren't scheduled to go to the grocery store yet.  It is by far the most delicious flour tortillas.  We even enjoy the funky shapes, since I can't roll a full circle tortilla yet and we don't have a press.  THANK YOU again for sharing a part of you to our family.  I always think of you now whenever I make them.
Oh my goodness! Thank you do much for remaking this video. I love this recipe but mine kept coming out dry and hard. I couldn’t figure out what was wrong. I knew I was following everything exactly. But watching this video helped so much for some reason 🤦🏻‍♀️😂
I don't understand why my tortillas always come out like tostadas 😣
Thanks for the recipe! We tried making these, followed the recipe exactly, and the tortillas were stiff.  Do you have any hints or tips?
I wish this video was in spanish, so my mom could understand this wonderful tutorial.
Woow I've been trying to do this for ever by watching different YouTube channels and they never came out I try your and they came out I love your channel I've made several recipes from your channel thank you so much
I just now made these and they came out soft and wonderful. Thank you for teaching in such a simple way!
who else is bored and wants to cook more in quarantine 💀🤪
Can I use soft flour instead Apf?
How long do they last in the refrigerator?
I followed the recipe but my tortillas never formed any bubbles. Did I do something wrong?
A mí siempre se me quiebran las tortillas, consejos?
I used your recipe yesterday and it was so easy to make and so yummy at the end, thank you. I do not have an iron skillet and when I waited for the bubbles it was already to late but with the second / third one I found out when to change it to the other side. In the beginning they did not felt so soft but we kept them warm and when we used them for Chimichangase it was easy to handle.
I've started using your tortilla recipe because we love how they come out. And maybe some day I'll figure out how to roll out a circle! Lol
Mine always end up dry. When i pull apart my dough it's not elastic, any help?
So glad to get the exact measurements. When I was growing up n I’d get home from school my  Mom would have the balls made already and covered. She would say the balls are ready to be rolled( that was my chore before dinner). I can make a perfect round tortilla but not the  dough. I love the smell of tortillas cooking.    When I’d make the dough, tortillas came out like crackers so that discouraged me from making it. Thank you🙏🏼
Thanks!! I made them exactly as described. They turned out Tender and delicious.
Do they come out the same with butter?
Never saw your first video but I'm sure it was GREAT. I used this today & made great tortillas. Instead if lard(can't use it, religious reasons) I used ghee instead, (purified butter).
6:19 look at the flick of da wrist...💀
Hey, could you please tell me the approximate diameter size of a tortilla once it's rolled? I am going to give a try to this tonight, my love and thanks from France! 😊
Thank you for this recipe! I hate store bought tortillas, they have that same weird smell and don't taste good. The first time I made these, they came out flat and crispy. But decided to weigh instead of measuring and they are perfect now. I'm constantly making these! I'll never go back to store bought 😊
You are awesome, Mama! I used to measure my ingredients and then I discovered for myself the power of weighing. I say you are awesome because I see that you care! This us an excellent video. You could have stood your ground with the weights and left those who for now are measuring to figure it out. But you really stepped in and helped. God richly bless you! I weigh, but I found this video so helpful and caring. I will be making the butter tortilla today for my neighbors.💯❤👍🏻👏🏻
I keep having issue of getting crispier tortillas. Any advice? I love your video!
You are so well spoken and so detailed on making torts.. mine came out ok but will keep practicing..  thank you
Hi, when I am rolling the dough every time I flip it it shrink smaller again. Why does it keep doing that?
I got the taste but they still break on me in half... I knead it for 15 min and still too hard ... please help!!! Hope 😓😓😓
As a (very) amateur cook, I have recently discovered the joy of making unleavened bread (matzo, naan, tortillas, etc). You mix the ingredients, knead it until it's ready, roll it and cook it. No playing around with keeping yeast alive, perfect times and temperatures for rising, etc. Am I alone, or do other cooks feel the same way.
I tried this recipe yesterday and it worked perfect. My tortillas were delicious 😋
Thank you I watch you all the time I’m making tortillas exactly how you told me with the bacon grease love you thank you for your gentle
I'm making these right now i did get 12 ..lol thank you
I made these for the first time tonight.   They were delicious.
Loved this tortillas recipe. It is really amazing. I tried this recipe at my home and found this recipe very easy to make. Also sharing here an article on Homemade flour tortillas recipe. Check out the recipe here:  https://www.recipespack.com/homemade-flour-tortillas-simplyrecipes-com/

Would whole wheat flour work the same ?
Hi! I’ve tried twice so far and can’t seem to get them right. I’m not ready to give up but if you can offer some advice that would be great. Mine are coming out no pliable or soft at all 😭 I’m using hot water. I don’t know if I’m not kneading it enough or using too much flour when I’m rolling them out. HELP PLEASE!
Thank you . Great video. Clearly explained and unpretentious.  Keep up the good work.
Simply Mamá Cooks THANK YOU FOR SHARING YOUR TALENTS  , BEST BLESSINGS .
Can you leave the little bolitas overnight? If so should I fridge them?
Finally! Tonight I tried this recipe and my tortillas were soooooo delicious! Nothing compared to the ‘harina preparada’ 😋 and your video was very detailed and you explained everything soooo easily! I will continue to use this recipe in the future! My entire household devoured the 16 tortillas that came from this batch! Thank you!!!!!
Absolutely fantastic!! Thank you so much for doing this. They turned out perfectly, just so delighted. xo
Hi there! Question, is't possible to over work/knead your dough if not what texture am I looking for? My dough ended up being tough and when flatten, my edges keep on curling back. Help please 🙏
Nice.
I’ve made your recipe twice now! This video was so helpful!
Can you use almond flour, or other types of flour?
I am extremely happy that your recipe for making tortillas came out perfect😇 I have tried other tortillas recipe on YouTube but fail twice . Decided to give your recipe a try and soo happy with the results. A perfect tortillas!! Thank you mama for your recipe😇
How long do you think the tortillas will last before getting hard or molding?
in the middle of trying this recipe a 2nd time. made the balls a little smaller, got 17 resting now. i did 12 and yes they were too big haha. hoping for more circular shapes this time!! thank you so much!
They look exactly like my mom's.  Can't wait to try your recipe. Thank you for posting this video!
My tortillas did not turn out at all like yours. I followed every step as much as I could. When I started mixing the ingredients so that I could knead, my hand immediately sunk into the mixture and I was unable to get it out without grabbing a spatula. I finally got the dough to a similar texture and followed suit. When I put the tortillas in the pan, however, it turned into a flatbread type of deal. I don't know what went wrong during the process, but I had to throw the whole thing away. I'm so disheartened by this, as I already prepared the rest of the food. I don't even have the heart to try it again tonight.
King Arthur flour changes things! I love and swear by it!!
The are tasty even with all of the effort,btw is it better to rest the dough before kneading?
I did it! Third time is a charm! So happy they finally came out great! Figured out that the heat was too low and I was rolling them too thin. Now to get the corn tortillas under my belt! Thank you!
Delicious!
Just made these.   I got frisbee
Thank you, blessings 🙏💗🌷
yum great for pizzas
Thank you so much.....my boys love your recipe. We made a "batch"... The to-tos (4yr old grandson) was gone so fast. We deep fried a few,a bit of powdered sugar, nutmeg and cinnamon.... topped with ice cream. It was great. Thanks again for such a great recipe!
i hope this helps out i kinda just counted the seconds in between her flips,  its about 40 seconds on each, start on 30 seconds each side and finish each side with 10 more seconds
Thank you!!!! With your recipe and your instructions I was finally successful with the flour tortillas 👍👍😁😁 Im so happy 😁
Thanks for the recipe! I just made sure to share.
The extra tips are really helpful!
Thank you so much for this tutorial!! First time ever I made tortillas and we actually ate them ! I have carpal tunnel and it was so easy using my stand mixer !
I just wanted to thank you for this video! I tried it and they turned out awesome!  I'll never buy tortillas again!
Great tutorial done in real time with nice soothing music. Thank you, I needed a refresher on how to make these and it did the trick!
Your tortillas look yummy, I'm certainly going to try to make them myself. Thanks for this helpful video 😀👍
thank you Mama
Best recipe, thanks and following 👍🏼
I'm super sad and angry  at the same time.  I've  try twice in the same  day but, both times i fail😭😭😭 at the cooking time my tortillas just turned out hard really  hard 😭😭 i guess I'm  never trying again.  I've  been over and over my head reading  the recipe to see what i did wrong but I can't  put my finger on where it was. 😭😭 first (second) and last try.  Thank you you were great, i just couldn't get it.
Does the type of pan matter?
All of your tortilla videos are great. I've watched everyone of them,  yet it is this one that helped me to achieve perfect tortillas.  ❤
Awesome recipe thank You
My dough came out perfect and stretchy but for some reason my tortillas still come out hard. Could it be what I’m using to cook them that makes them hard ?
I made these tortillas today, and they turned out excellent. The recipe uses the perfect ratio of flour to shortening. Just roll 'em thin, and they'll cook soft and flexible.
Are those protective grease guards on your oven dials?  if they are then that is so cool.  Cleaning grease that accumulates around stove dials is always a tedious pain.  I'm going to look for those or try making them myself.  Muchisimas for a great video.
Thank you! I’ve been so frustrated trying to make good, soft tortillas. These are amazing! Your directions were so clear and helpful. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Fantastic video,you make it look very easy and can’t wait to try this! THANKS!
I made your tortilla shells today.  I like to use fresh ground whole wheat flour, so I used 2 cups of whole wheat flour and one cup of all purpose flour.  They turned out wonderful!!  Thank you so much for teaching us to make flour tortilla shells.  You are amazing!
Thank you so much for your video Mam, its really interesting and I really want to make it. But i donot have Lard and shortening, so if I am using oil whether it will be similar with using Lard or shortening or not
So I just made these and I completely impressed myself!!! Thank you so much for this recipe!
Awesome! Can you freeze these?
THANK YOU!! This is the best tortilla recipe and instructional video I have found!!!!
help. my tortillas are stiff and do not roll, they break. my Mexican MIL says to not knead it at all, but she also mixes the lard into the flour very well before adding the water. the dough seems fine and meets the "some-what tacky" description. it is not smooth and "pillowy".
Thank you so much for your video! This is my first time and my tortillas came out exactly like you presented! Looking forward to more of your recipes
Bless your heart for adding measurements as I’m converting the recipe to to gluten free flour and that’s the best way.  Thank you for spelling things out for those of us that never had Mama’s to teach them.  My favorite are refried beans,   I tried making them but it’s not the same as in the restaurant. Can you please do a video on those sometime?
I followed your recipe and they came out hard as hell yuk.
Just made these! Came out wonderful. Thank you as always. Your recipes are dank as fuck 🔥
I followed your recipe and they came out hard and with no flavor the dough and rolled out tortillas looked like yours in the video what went wrong?
And my dough always rips
You are amazing because ive troed this recipe over and over again and i swear i just cannot get it right !😭 always to hard im assuming im ising to much flour but i swear im measuring as best i can lol
Ok, but i only have the water.
Thank you mama..I'm definitely trying it today.
Can i use vegetable spread if so how much?
I followed exactly as it said and my dough came out hard.  Does the water have to be more hot than warm or  should I have added more water ????
saw someone post this on reddit a few days ago. Gave it a try this morning. Not sure if I'm rolling thin enough, and could probably make them bigger in my 12" CI skillet. Overall, I think it turned out really well. My wife and mother in law like the indian style nan bread and while their favorite bakery is closed right now, they said this is a pretty good alternative. They didn't come out very flexible like yours at the end but they still turned out alright. Thanks for the recipe. I'm saving it and going to make more another day. Worked well for my breakfast this morning with eggs, sausage, and cheese. :D
Why do you use hot water I was told that it had to be warm water?
Newbie.  I’m going to try to make those.   Thanks.  My first time. And I’m 72. 🥰
Wonderful video. I appreciate being able to watch the entire process in real time. It was very helpful
I made these but I never could get that smooth texture to my dough. I kneaded at least a half hour. Mine were not great (totally my fault!) I’m going to try again!
If I want to use butter, how much butter and unsalted or salted????? I made this version last night but I didn't let it rest long enough. Still super good but I know what texture I'm looking for. Would like to use butter this time. Thanks sooooooo much!!!!!
wow! You explain this process in great detail that I am going to try to make flour tortillas again after many years and the local store running out of this product because of the situation we are in. Back in the 80's, I used to live with a bunch of guys from Mexico and they all made their own flour tortillas but were pretty secretive about how they got their tortillas to look like the ones you would buy at the store. Again, THANK YOU!
Hello.. I'm new to your channel.  Lol. I was wondering can you help me out with the measurements if only using 1 cup of flour then how much of the other ingredients? If not I do understand. Thank you for sharing your time and recipes to all of us.
Hello! Where can I get a stainless bowl like yours?  Sticky dough seems to release more easily for you using this bowl? I love your videos You, yourself, are a peach with a sweet family! Stay well, stay safe!
Fucking painful to watch. Tatataday jr.  damn
Thank you for the detailed explanation.
What if i don’t have baking soda?
thank you, thank you, thanks you,  im a complete newbie when it comes to baking.  this is a lot of help!
I don't know if I ever will eat store bought flour tortillas. Hands should be really clean.
I think mine where still to thick. Flavor was 👍🏽
Omg Im drooling I’d eat that with some butter while it’s still hot
what size are your dough balls? would you say about 1 -2 Tbsp
I measured in weight, used Ling Arthur flour. They were very difficult to make thin, and didn’t taste anywhere near as good as yours look, nor how my grandma’s used to taste. The dough itself came out GREAT!!! Very soft!!! But the tortillas didn’t have much flavor. And as they cooled they got stiff 😞. I’ll keep trying.
Thanks
Can't wait to try these out
How do you store the tortillas? And how long are they good?
Trying!!!!
I just saw your "re-make" of original video. You have a great recipe. My problem was always the kneading.  I whisked all the dry ingredients in a bowl, then added the shortening with my fingers.  Turned on my Kitchen Aide mixer as I added hot tap water for seven minutes. Comes out PERFECT every time. So simple and tasty! Reminds me of my mom, thank you Maggie
Yo I just made these tonight they were so damn good thank you ma’am!!!!
Your first video was great. Those that complained aré talentless. You are a nicer person than I. Guess that's why I don't do videos. I love all your recipes and I have been cooking since I was nine and now I am 73 years old!  I am happy you list ingredients measurements because I cook without
Thank you for this demonstration! I am a visual learner and the way you showed us each step really help me make delicious tortillas!
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Love that you redid the original. I’m watching from March 2020 during the COVID19 nightmare and our stores are low on tortillas so I’ve bought the ingredients to make some for me and my family cuz we can’t not have tortillas lol. I was worried about not having a rolling pin or comal but this redo reminded me that we have a pizza pan, cast iron skillet, and wine bottles! Gotta make it work lol. Thank you!
Wow and I thought your last tortilla tutorial was great this is the best one I've seen so far . Thank you for taking your time and showing me how it's done.
Brilliant video thanks for making and showing how to do.
Thank you 😘
Since you are using gas stove turn skillet upside-down and you have a flat surface to work off of
Ok,y’all I have made and remade and remade these suckers and every time it just would not bubble up....  Y’all check your baking powder it will make or break your life-so much wasted flour, lol bought new baking powder and 💥 perfect flour tortillas!! I am so freaking excited-waste line won’t be however I am excited that it finally worked!!!!   So it is the  ingredients y’all that can hinder you making these as well so make sure everything is as new as possible!   It’s not her recipe it  can be as simple as dead baking powder!!
Awesome!!! Thank you for this video! Lol I followed your other video, got excited and tried making the tortillas.. after watching this video hahahaha I figured out I added way too much flour back into the tortillas. They came out “solid” as my husband said 🤣 I’ll be sure to not over flour my work surface next time. Thank you!!
Thank you ❤
I am going to try this recipe out tomorrow. Wish me luck.
Porque no habla Español???
I just shared some high altitude information. It mainly refers to baking, so tortilla making should be pretty much the same.😊
High Altitude Baking — Good Rules of Thumb   ￼  High altitude is generally considered 3,500 or more feet above sea level. If this is you, then you need to make some adjustments to your recipes to ensure that your baked goods rise evenly.  Oven Temperature  Increase by 15-25℉  Since at higher altitudes evaporation happens faster, you’ll need to help your baked goods set up a bit faster in the oven by raising the temperature.  Baking Time  Decrease by 20-30%  This is to compensate for the increased oven temperature you’ll need at higher altitudes. A higher temp means a faster cook, so be careful not to overdo it.  Flour  Increase by 1 tbsp at 3,500 ft, and by 1 tbsp per 1,500 ft  Adding flour helps to steady the rise of your baked goods and add structure to them as they grow in the oven.  Sugar  Decrease by 1 tbsp per cup  Since liquids evaporate faster at higher elevations, the concentration of sugar goes up. Be sure to reduce to keep your cakes, brownies, and cookies from collapsing.  Liquids  Increase by 1 to 2 tbsp per 1,000 ft, and 1 ½ tsp per additional 1,000 ft  It’s all about compensating for faster evaporation here — keep things from drying out and crisping up before they rise by adding a bit more liquid, whether it’s water, milk, oil, or eggs.  Baking Powder/Soda  Decrease by 20% above 3,500 ft, by 50% above 5,000 ft, and by 75% above 6,500 ft  Reducing the amount of your leavening agents will help your baked goods to rise more gradually at higher elevations.  Yeast  Decrease by 25% above 3,500 ft and account for a shorter rising time  Yeast breads will rise faster at higher elevations, but will collapse in on themselves if you don’t reduce the amount of yeast called for in the recipe.
Great recipe!! They look delicious.
Looks delicious 😋
3 cups its almost 450 gr of flour.
Good video and reminds me of my mother's way of making tortillas.  The big difference is that she used a flat cast iron grill about nine inches in diameter with no sides which mad it easier to turn the tortillas, she called it a placa.  Love all your other recipes too.
I love love love your videos ! ! I actually have a flour tortilla recipe that is great for some of us not so accomplished. So easy. But I just need to know how to make a you tube video. Lol. Can you give me some pointers on what equipment and how you do it? Thanks your loyal fan.
Watching you knead was very soothing 😊
Mine didn't come out like that I dont know what I did wrong 😪😭😣
Will they stay soft even after they've been sitting for a while ?  The last 3 recipes that I followed were failures the tortillas turned hard as a rock after sitting for a while Ughhh and I followed their recipes :-( I'm gonna try yours so wish me luck is using the King Arthur flour a must ?
Thank you so much for all your work and time, this video is so detailed! Perfect! Love from Slovenia:)
Is it possible to over knead? I followed the recipe exactly, except for the part to let it rest and they came out stiff.
I'm going to try to make tortillas.  Thank you!
Seriously Excellent Recipe. Thanks a lot. Jagdeep (India)
I just found your YouTube video on tortilla making! I’m so happy I did. I’ve made them 3 times and I’m getting better each time! We love the soft, fresh, tortillas! I still need to get the heat right but I’m working on it. So easy to make and since the dough is silky soft, it’s a breeze to kneed! I just need to find the measurements by weight you posted. I don’t see them. Thank you so much for this second video!
i've been making tortillas on and off for years, i tried your technique and was really impressed at how super soft they turned out. usually when my masa turns out tough, i re-cycle it into impanadas, but with your technique i now get soft, tender tortillas. thank you.
Excellent Vid made it look sooo easy. I used 400g flour, 65 shortening, followed the video, but mine had no bubbles when cooking and were hard unlike yours, wife loved them.  Help, was my dough to dry?
I tried this recipe out but substituting Greek yogurt for the lard and it turned out really good.
So they came out great thank u!!!
Just set them to rest hopefully they come out like yours!
I love your recipes and have many of them in my cookbook. But I do have one request, would you please provide some instructions in the contents for the video. The ingredient list is very much appreciated, but some high-level process steps would be great.
After the first turn. move the pan sideways and rotate the tortilla, this cooks the edges.
I FINALLY FIGURED OUT WHY MY TORTILLAS WERE COMING OUT AWFUL! I did not know that Baking Powder expires! All this time I was trying and never getting bubbles to form. It was outdated Baking Powder. So if anyone else has followed this recipe exactly as done and still getting hockey pucks instead of tortillas, check your baking powder!
Excelente forma de explicar súper claro
Ya me dio hambre
i made these tonight and they did not bubble.. did I roll them too thin? cook the wrong? they are pretty but not flimsy?? HELP
You Are A “Blessing from Above!” Sweet Lady!! Will You be My Cooking Sister??!! You Are THE BEST!!.. & SO ADMIRED!!

I wanna Be YOU when I Grow Up!! Hugs & Kisses!!⭕️❌🤗😘❤️😍🥰
Tried this today- the tortillas came out AWESOME!
Thank you so much, I haven’t made tortillas in years since my kids were little and they came out 👌
I weighed 3 cups of flour, fluffed, and it came to 205g, not 400g as you recommend. that's a big difference. am I doing it wrong?
Thank you for the video! Loved how you talked step by step, btw your voice is soothing (compliment) gracias 💙
My dough always shrinks back after I roll it. What should I do?
Can this be made using corn flour?
Mine always end up burning and my pan ends up smoking, even on low, with all the flour. They also don't inflate. Maybe I'm using the wrong type of pan.
Sooo bad for you too much cholesterol...have you heard of the ongoing cholesterol problem in the country there so dam good mexican crepes no
Wow! I really like your style, and I appreciate that you didn't fast forwarded your video. Like this we get the real feel of how it's supposed to look. I enjoy your videos. You're good at what you do. I can't wait to make the tortillas! 😊
Hello... gracias por compartir la.receta . En mi pais Honduras las tortillas de harina las comemos con frijoles refritos, queso, huevo, cremaz aguacate , bueno al final al gusto de cada persona. Las llamamos baleadas,.segui.sus instricciones y me ha transportado a Honduras esta receta salrn super suaves y delicosas. Muchas gracias☺👐
Don't forget if want a treat for kids.  Instead of cooking on dry skillet u put oil in skillet and fry the tortilla.  Both sides.  It frys up fast.  Then as kids we would sprinkle sugar and cinnamon.  Yum yum, with my kids we loved using honey.  Very nice.  Thanks Simply Mama, I also use your corizo recipe.  Love them
Followed this recipe exactly how you explained it... a success! Only one tortilla came out hard and that was because i didn’t roll it thin enough. If it’s not thin enough, no bubbles and it’s too firm. Thank you, thank you.
My dough comes out perfect but my tortillas in the end come out hard
This is on my list. I will make these tonight. Wish me luck.
I tried your recipe but they didn’t come out fluffy n pliable. They were still great tasting. When I cooked them they didn’t puff up. I’ll try again. Maybe watching this video. I’ll try your suggestions in this video.
Absolutely wonderful, DELICIOUS recipe! Now I have to make some, who cares if it's 1:45 am, lol, while friends are out drinking, I'm home fixin' some homemade flour tortillas! 😉😁🙆
I did everything  and they looked great until I cooked them. They weren't  pliable and didn't  bubble up much. I  have  made them before and they bubbled up but i didn't  knead it  that long. What may be the reason?
A few things I learned on the first two tries at achieving tortillas like those - I added a small amount more to the shortening because the first try, I noticed the tortilla didn't have that "greasy" appearance as it started to cook, as yours did. Also, in WI, the dry, cold air and forced air heating makes everything dry out very quickly. I used a very damp paper towel over the rolled out tortillas as they hung on the bowl, waiting to be cooked. It seemed to help get the texture closer to what I have in mind. However, I haven't got my tortillas to form air pockets/bubbles! Should I add more baking powder? I am hoping the third time's a charm.  Thank you for patiently walking us through the steps and explaining everything clearly.
First time making tortillas and these came out perfect 👌🙌 Thanks so much for sharing your recipes 😊❤️
😋👌🏽
Too damn  long. This isn't rocket science!  After 7 min still mixing dough. No thanks!
Thank you,
Thank you so much this recipe is great my husband and I have been trying to make tortillas at home not quite successful in the taste nor texture thank you this recipe is awesome.
Ok, I think I found my problem of not getting bubbles when cooking and not having a soft tortilla. I researched and if your baking powder is expired, it will cause this. I looked and my baking powder expired in 3/2018... lmao. Hopefully next time I can perfect this.
Thank you. Enjoyed making these and your sons still looks better than my first efforts! but they got eaten so good result!
This is the first time I've seen this video. It's helpful. Thank you. I always wondered how they make them. They look great.
You make your tortillas just like my mama did, they look great!!
Thanks for this video. Our tortillas came out really good. I really appreciate you! Happy holidays!
I made these following the recipe from this video...super soft dough and  and yummy when first cooked...I reheated some just 5 hours later...YIKES! They were hard, stiff and not pleasant to eat. I was bummed out because I made them to share with family who weren’t present immediately after I made them. The warning of 24 hr shelf life, should read a lot less. While they are still edible (crunchy and hard, but good flavor), I don’t think I’ll be making these again.
Good morning Mama.I have been watching your video numerous times to try and duplicate your tortillas. I have purchased the King Authur flour as well as the baking soda you recommend. The thing I am doing different is using a stand mixer (Kitchenaid) to do the kneading. I am kneading in the stand mixer for 7-8 minutes. When I cook the tortillas in the cast iron skillet, the taste is really good, however, they will not bubble up with he air pockets. They are more like a flat bread tortilla. Do you think it is possible I am over kneading the dough? Since you are kneading by hand, how do you know when you have completed to kneading? Is there a texture you are looking for or pressing in on the dough ball to see a reaction, springing back? I have made your recipe one time perfectly, however, the balance of the attempts have been failures, probably 6-8 times. Please let me know your thoughts if you don't mind. I would really appreciate your your thoughts and input. Thank you.
Thank you so much for these videos!  You are an excellent teacher!
If I don't have a rolling pin or a wine bottle can I use my dog's ass🐕🐕🍷
Thank!
💕 I'm so happy watching you make these ! I bought the White Wings flour tortilla mix before seeing so many of you doing it from scratch. I know someone had the White Wings mix, but she still added lard & baking powder. I don't suppose that was you ? Just wondering. Thank you for your beautiful recipe & your patience with the more inexperienced tortilla makers ! I'm going to try with the "mix", and with a scratch recipe. I just need to see for myself which way creates a tastier tortilla. 😊😋   Thanks again !! 👏🏼😉💖
Great torTHia recipe!
What if we don't have a cast iron? Can I use a regular pan?
Could you use bacon fat that you've saved?
Thanks .... I made some last night and no see what all I did wrong . I'll try again today . Thanks for helping me out with this second video .
Can self rising flour be used instead of all purpose??
Good and simple!
Love the video. Thank you.  where can i get a bowl like yours? I've been making bread for a couple of years and almost always knead the dough by hand. I can tell more about the dough. My wife bought a stand mixer last year but i have rarely used it.
can you make these using self rising flour? thanks
Hey sweetie, I thought I recognized your beautiful voice. It's me from your other YouTube videos on weight loss 🤗  Thank you, I haven't made tortillas in over 20 years, since my husband isn't a big fan of whether he eats them or not. But, I've missed the home made tortillas, I've been making the just add water tortillas r years, but not the same. They are good, but nothing beats a Home Made Tortillas. Thanks for sharing 🤗💖
I'm so happy you weighed ingredients. As European I find problem with cup system as I'm used with grams or milliliters. Especially weight is the most precise! Thank you. I will try this recipe tonight.
Guaooo. From Venezuela.
I love your channel so so much!! I also love cooking and enjoy learning how to cook food from different cultures, i find your videos so easy to follow and when I try them it always comes out so good! Thank you!!
U r amazing!!!!  Thank you for this video!!!
Today I made my first tortilla’s but it didn’t turn out very good and I wish I would of found this before I made the ones from Pinterest lol 😂 that recipe really didn’t tell me about how thin your supposed to have your tortillas and it didn’t say to cook them until it bubbles up a little bit either and it was dry and hard nothing like your recipe! I will definitely make your recipe and practice more lol 😂 but thank you so much for sharing sharing your knowledge of making these delicious tortillas!
Thank you SO MUCH for remaking this video with the measurements. Yesterday my tortillas came out stiff, but when I made them today using the weight measurements they came out just like yours! I was so inspired that I almost made a second batch but decided to wait until next weekend. 🙂  Thank you again!
Great video.
You make everything so easy to make! I've already made so many of your recipes 😁
I’ve watched this video about 5x & I’ve been reading so many of these comments..& wow!! I am so excited to try this recipe tonight! Thank you for your very detailed video & a big thumbs up for doing it in real time & not fast forwarding!
How do you store the tortillas to last for 24hrs?
Thank you so much
I used baking soda for my tortillas! Is that why they’re hard?
Full of skill,thank you.
My best friend is from Mexico and her mom makes the best tortillas. We got to go for Christmas 4 years ago it was the best, especially the tamales!  So I've was hoping to recreate the tortillas. But, they turned out hard. Even though the dough felt right... I think it was soft and tacky. But, in the end they were hard and dry and there were no bubbles when they were cooking.  :( Maybe it's just fall and I'll need even more water then I added?
Question: I always thought we were supposed to pop the big bubbles. 😬 But I never see you do it. Is it something we shouldn’t do? I think I remember my tia saying that if it rises into a big bubble that it meant that you were gonna get married. Lol 🤷🏽‍♀️
Thanks for taking the time to share your receipe ❤ I made it but my tortillas won't  puff up and I don't understand why? I followed all the instructions 😭
I don't know who put thumbs down but bottom line they're haters. I tried and love❤ your tortilla recipe and all I can say is, thank you for taking your time out and sharing with us. Keep the recipe's coming👍
Blame the messy dough on your son. Nice try
Si pregatiten ullinjte ne kushte shtepie
I’m from Texas but I’m military so I’m in Washington. I’ve tried to make these tortillas but I feel like they always come out so dry and hard :( do you think it’s because it’s not as humid up here? Do I need to add more water or lard? What am I doing wrong ? :( HELP PLEASE
I thoroughly enjoyed this video with each step explained in real time. Thanks for the ingredient list in the description area.  I see you have given us recipes for lots of my favorite Mexican foods, thank you. Liked (already subscribed)
No puedes  dar la reseta  porfis en español
I find when I use anything other types of fat for the tortillas they do not have the same good flavor as when using lard.
I had been making dry tortillas for years, now I know why! Thanks for your insight :)
Great job! I know how to make tortillas. But I always enjoy watching other 👩‍🍳 cook. And the way you shape your dough is how my mother taught me.
you make it look e-z
why are you repeating yourself so much? we have rewind if we need it. geez.
Food e-day...! Maak je niet druk om vriendjes, "*schop je vriendje uit je hemelvaart-tuig*" ze redden zichzelf wel uit de hel net als hoe jij jezelf red eruit! Haha
Thank you for sharing, the tortillas came out beautifully and delicious!!!!
Everytime I try my tortillas come out hard !! I dont understand what I'm doing wrong ! 😭 help!
Perfection!  My first time making tortillas. I love to cook and cook almost every day so I decided to expand my skills. I copied the recipe exactly and the tortillas turned out perfect.  My husband loved them. Cooking temp was the only learning curve. I used a cast iron on a gas flame.  Kneading for 10 minutes was the key. When I rolled out the dough I had no shrinking and was able to roll thin with no breakage. I even draped each rolled tortilla on the edge of the bowl and had no sticking nor tearing. Thank you so much for your attention to detail and easy to follow instructions.  I even got 13 with one large dough ball, so should have been 14. Now the tuck/turn motion will take some practice 😉
Thank you!! Honestly, such a great guide to making the best tortilla out there! Much love from across the world <3 <3 <3 te amo! <3 <3 <3
I just Love You!
Thank you for giving me the option of using oil
WHO GAVE THIS A THUMBS DOWN!??!? These tortillas are FRESH and look DELICIOUS AF!!! All the folks who got frustrated making them gave this a thumbs down. Haters.
Thank you for this video!
Would this work with a tortilla press?
Your channel is awesome thank you so much for this tutorial!  My kids wanted to make homemade tortillas and I had no clue where to start, so glad your video came up first because our tortillas came out perfect!
Hello!  Can you tell me how long the tortillas will stay fresh?  Is it best to eat them the day they are made?  My tortillas got hard the same day I made them. Thanks for your videos. You are great and your kids are adorable!
I love all your videos I’ve made these everyday for the last week they are delicious!!
Trying your recipe from your original video and happened to watch this one in the process to see how it may have differed. I love old school cooking, but I am not a hand kneader. I did it in the stand mixer. I find that 3-5 minutes for kneading most breads is sufficient. In this case I did 4 and the dough came together perfectly. I will edit once I cook them, but I’m certain 10 minutes will overdevelop the gluten for almost any bread in a stand mixer. I typically use half the time needed from hand mixing and I’ve always gotten pretty solid results.
First batch I did with the original video. Sticky mess. Found this. Measured by weight. Perfect. Only question. How do you get them round 😂 practice I’m guessing. I’ve never even rolled out a pie crust before. Might look odd but so good and the kids love them. Doing the butter ones next. 👍 Thank you!!
This recipe is closest to what my grandma and mom used to use.  I wanted to know if they are still soft and pliable after a day?  I am going to try to make these tonight.  Some recipes I have tried, the tortillas are not as soft the next day even when putting them in a plastic baggie.  Just wondering why?  Thank you for sharing.
Made flour tortillas for the first time yesterday and they are not pliable at all! Since I've made corn tortillas for about 6 months now, I assumed these would become pliable in a wet cloth. No such luck. Thank you for your video and I will definitely attempt making tortillas using your measurements. Thank you for posting!
I have a few questions that hopefully you will be able to answer.  I just got through making tortillas pretty much based on your original recipe.  mine were tasty but did not come out like yours.  What I noticed with mine is that whether I roll them out or use a tortilla press they all seem to shrink back.  The dough is fairly elastic.  As a result, my tortillas are relatively think compared to yours (or they appear to be).  I am wondering if my dough was a little too dry.  It felt pretty good for a bread dough but when I was done my dough did not stick to my fingers as yours did (I live in Phoenix, so it may be a bit drier here than wherever you are).  I am suspecting that you want them a bit moist so they come out more like a crepe than bread.  My tortilla also did not bubble.  When I first take them off the pan the outside seems a bit stiff and dry, but when I put them in the container to keep them warm they soften up nicely. So, my first questions are, does it seem reasonable that I need to make my dough a bet wetter? Second question is, what size tortilla do you make?  I am guessing somewhere around 8 or 9 inches, assuming a 10" pan. Related to that question is, have you ever weighed the dough balls that you make and if so how much do they generally weight?  In trying to make an approximate 6" tortilla my dough balls have been weighing in at around 2 ounces.   Thanks, I enjoyed the video.   Doug Smith
Made these today - they came together really easily. They were delicious served with picadillo!
Thank you for both of your videos. I’ve made them twice so far and my son loves them.
IMPORTANT QUESTION ON KNEADING! What if I don't NEED the DOUGH, I just really really want it.
Boy!, You must have gotten harsh criticisms to have to explain such basic principles so carefully. I am imagining the bachelor using his 12 oz coffee cup for flour and blaming you. I DO, however, have to criticize your method. You didn't sift the water.
I LOVE your tutorial! I love all of the minutest details!! It REALLY helps! Thank you for caring AND sharing ❤️
Thank you so much! I moved to japan from Texas and one thing I love to eat is tacos. It’s so difficult to get good tortillas here so I’m so happy I found your recipe! Again thank you so much!
Delicious

what lard do I use for best results, please
You may or may not know, but I’m Celiac and use gluten free flours, made from various things like coconut, almond, rice, and etc., mixture will they work to make tortillas like this?
Made these this morning.....delicious!!!  Please check your weights.  Per the King Arthur site, a cup of unbleached AP  flour weighs 120 grams.  They do not sell bleached flour....so 3 cups would be 360 grams.  In further research, I learned Crisco and lard do not weigh the same. Lard is heavier by 9 grams. per 1/3 cup.  Being a soaper, I laways  measure in grams..  Since the 360  grams is less than the verbal and written recipes, it was bit wet .  My hubby insists on rolling the balls in flour before rolling,  so all turnedout perfectly.  Will definately do this again.  Now just to be able to roll to a perfect circle!  Thanks for this 2nd video.
Geniaaaaa
You sound very sarcastic
You're awesome
Thank you so much for this video!! I recently started cooking again and could not figure out why my tortillas kept coming out hard. The lard tip definitely helped a lot!! Thank you and I hope to enjoy seeing more of your videos.
Lard=cardiovascular problems. You have been warned.
Thanks so much for doing this for dummies like me.😄👍
I think you put to. Much baking powder  for only 3 cups of flour
Read it seems like a lot of work specially when it's like a dollar fifty for a dozen of them at the store
I cant get the bubbles to save my life mines arent as pliable either but they taste great!
Hot water or lukewarm water?
This seems so simple! You make it look achievable! I cannot wait to try making these for my family!!
I just followed this same recipe and my tortillas came out great for my first time. Thanks for this recipe. And thanks for this video. I been following you for a very long time. I LOVE watching all your videos!!!  One question: can I let the dough balls sit on the counter overnight with a damp towel? I wanted to prep the dough so that way in the morning I just have to roll them out for my husbands lunch.
I just made this recipe with the EXACT measurements and step by step && it came out so good! This was my first time ever making homemade tortillas. I’d say I did pretty good for my first time.
Hello!! How are you?? I hope you are well. Did you happen to Change your name?? I was looking for you and it's coming up as simply Mama cooks . Just wanted to make sure. I love how  you cook and wanted to share your recipes with my sister in law , she already knew all about you and loves watching your channel. Your awesome no matter the name change . Hugs and kisses from California ❤️
Looks great once again can't wait to try... And again I just started my own channel (not as professional looking as yours) lol but please come take a look so far they have all been real easy recipes, everyone Please come and subscribe.. Thanks and thank you mama..
New subscriber very well executed a big thumbs up 👍 from across the pond 🇬🇧 I watched quite a few videos on how to make tortillas but yours are by far the best 😘👌👌👌👏👏👏👏
Shut the fuck up
Mine dont bubble up. What AM I doing wrong?
Tried this recipe several times and they have always come out perfect- today out of curiosity I pulled out a kitchen scale and made the dough using exact measurements and the dough feels completely different! Super pliable and soft! I will start using my scale from now on!! Thank you soooo much for this recipe!!!!!!
can you fry them to make chips?
Gochujang  thanks ! Always great recipes and a nice voice to go along !   Muy deliciosas sus tortillas ! 👍♥️⚘
You have a lucky husband, I bet you can give one heck of a message.
I measured 1/3 cup Crisco and got 58 grams.
I Love your videos! Being from San Antonio Texas I love mexican food. If your ever in San Antonio be sure to stop by El Miligrito Cafe for some really great Mexican food...you can subscribe to them on Facebook for some delicious original Mexican food posts. By the way I spent a year in Korea and love their food also. Right now I am stuck in Alabama.By the way, I love to cook! so if you know any nice Spanish females that can cook as good as you, please have them contact me! I am single and looking! Thank you for all the great videos!!!
Very slowly ur video cam
Thank you mama. For doing a retake👍 I think it’s very meticulous of yourself to make sure that you needed to do a retake because you must have received some not so happy comments from the first. I just watched the first one today.. but like with other videos that I have tried to copy exactly results were not the same.. big ups to you for your redo. I will be trying this second one tonight 🤗
You rock, love it
Awesome video very helpful
How do you know how much lard to put in your flour? For example you want 10 tortillas how do you know?
Thank all your video. I have a Q,  can dough be done in a machine for a bread dough ?
Is lard necessary? is there some other kind of substitute, maybe vegetarian?
Hi, I did my absolute best to follow the instructions just as you did in the video. But my tortillas keep coming out so think and are not soft. What could I possibly be doing wrong? Help!
Yummy
I will use this as my guide; I am still practicing and love these much better than store bought.  Also, when I make food for my family it's important to me that I do the whole meal from scratch!  I made some last week that were not that round, but I'm working on it.  How hot does the water have to be? Just hot to the touch like tap water or from the hot kettle? Thanks for showing us this step by step.  That's great that you teach your son too. 😄
Thank you for reposting a new video with answered questions. I made these from your other video (not realizing you had this one) and although tasty they turned out differently than yours. No bubbles. You basically touched on all my questions and even said you had no idea of higher altitudes. So I will keep trying to perfect mine.
Dumg to burn your Finger tips
Been making tortillas from your other video ever since I found it. The best tortillas.
Well I got in a hurry at the grocery store, and accidentally bought self rising flour, so I'm going to make it minus the baking powder. Hope it works.
I made this recipe WHILE watching/following yours & it was sticky in the bowl after mixing & when i took it out of the bowl it was sooo sticky. I don't know what i did wrong...
I was dying for some fresh tortillas. This was a great video thanks
Would coconut oil work for this too?
I just made these tortillas for the first time and they came out super soft and pliable!! Thank you for sharing such an easy recipe for these little gems!
So if i make 8 C flour do I use 2/3 lard.?
Wooow...so helpful I need it for business...thanks for sharing...GOD bless you .
Now those look good
One word sums up this video; BUTTER 😃😆😍🤗🙃😙
Trying it out right now super excited.
Fast forward for what!!!! Please continue to not cut away! FF-ing may also be the reason why your tortillas ain't popping as well!  Girl, we must have totally worked your  nerves with endless questions  on your other video because it was fool proof in my opinion ...the only thing I was a little unclear on was your  "grandma rolling move" other than than that..it was a epic vid! You really care about our tortilla lyfe! I'm making these tonight! Bless your heart for the 2nd time😉!!
You are amazing!
Yummy
Love your recipe! I tried it today and the flour tortillas came up delicious. Not as round and pretty as yours but wonderful taste. Thank you so much! ❤
Thank you, thank you, thank you!! I kept trying to make them with the recipe from Pattis Mexican Table (from the TV show)...They were dry, and no matter how many times I tried it, they came out the same. She had one extra cup of flour than you...NO WONDER!! Mine came out perfect after using your recipe..Thank you so much..(Maybe this is a dumb question, but Im curious as to why" tortilla" is the only word you used an accent on when talking? It just seemed strange since your speech is clearly without)
If I use shortening do I need to add more than 1/3 a cup? Thank you!
*perfect* recipe!!! I've made flour tortillas before, but they were always a bit dry/tough and sometimes too bland. I really appreciate gram measurements -- it helps a lot when measuring things like flour that measure very differently depending on which way the wind is blowing, and also with salt. I used Diamond Kosher salt, & using the weight measurement, they came out great. thank you so much! subscribed *and* my notification bell is on. Korean and Mexican foods are my absolute favorites.
It is not a tortilla   And ap ki english ma hai
Now your the only one whose vedio uses baking powder, my Mexican heritage always used it. Other vedios omitted it. Everything is exact to how my mom did it, thank you for expressing the correct way.
Muy bien explicado. El mejor que he visto. Tour vídeo Is outstanding. Moved the way you explosión  the process when making flour tortillas. Contrata.
my tortillas didnt puff up, and were not all that soft, what may of went wrong
Just made these today and they turned out awesome! Thank you :)
I made these today and they turned out perfect! So soft and yummy. Thank you for all your videos, your voice is so soothing and they are very informative. I could eat Mexican food every day but I keep to about 4 meals a week so I will probably try all your recipes in the future
Mmm-good! I never knew. Thx! :)
Just finished making these!!! I live at 7000 feet above sea level and the only thing I had to do was add more water- a full ounce to be exact! I have to say that this method/recipe will replace the way I’ve been making tortillas for the last 30 years! Great recipe! Thank you!!!!!
I will be trying this tonight I have a picky Mexican lover lol so hopefully he loves them and it can be a go to always. But I had a question what kind of lard did you use?   Will be getting some soon and want to get a good one or the one you used. ☺️💕
I am going to try out this recipe. I just made flour tortillas and they came out like chancletas!💀 Thank you for posting.
LOVE,LOVE THAT YOU SHOW YOUR YUMMY DELICIOUS RECIPES AND DIRECTIONS UNDERNEATH SO WE CAN HAVE THEM FOR LATER THANK YOU SO MUCH
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SHARING THE BRAND'S YOU USE
In Desi culture we say if your roti puffs up all the way it means the person you're cooking for is hungry
After using your recipe, a few times, I've found that through inexperience I didn't work the dough long enough to get it to that elastic-softy-pillowy texture, and the very best result I was able to achieve was using water so hot that it might have scolded my bare hands, and I noticed my dough stayed warm the entire time I kneaded it. The temperature of the water has been, for me, one of the MOST important steps in this process.
YOU ARE JUST THE BEST!!!!!!!!!
Hi I tried doing this recipe and don't know why my tortillas came out stiff hard and no bubbles came up as they cooked
First time was no no. Second time 100% Thank you!
Gracias por este video, uno de los mejores que hay. definitivamente gano un Sub. No puedo esperar por mas videos!
Hi Mama, can I also add some corn floor in it? If so, how much do you recommend? Best,
I think i will make it today...thx mama
My dough was too sticky to my hand and to the surface so I kept dusting flour untill it became similar to yours, but when I starting rolling it, it would revert to a smaller size every time. Is that because it's too dry or is it too moist?
Nice update, Hot Mama! May I please ask how many grams each mini dough is, for uniformity? Not sure if I missed it. Thank you.
What does "tacky" mean?
Made these tonight and they were perfect! Best ones i have made. I figured out my mistakes i was making before. . Thank you so much for sharing! Oh and i made  The carne guisada  too and it was awesome too!
Beautiful clean 🖐.  Thanks 🙏 4 sharing ur recipe
thank youu i just made them and i loveee them♡♡♡ i watched both videos and ur instructions are always easy to follow!
Beatiful, artistry
I miss my mom tortillas...gonna try make...some
Just made my FIRST ever tortilla batch today (from your other video instructions using solid Crisco.)  I was glad to have all of your detailed instructions.  Mine dough formed and rolled out great - with stretch - and when the bubbles formed on top of the tortillas in my (8") cast iron pan I did a little happy dance.  They stayed soft (I had to try the eat 'hot with butter' thing... yes, very good!) and I made up a ground beef mix and these rolled up around the mix easily.  Great recipe ~ a keeper. (No more grocery store tortillas here.) Thank you!
Hey Mama, I've been using your recipe (with scales, so it's exact) for a while and whilst they're lovely when they come out, it takes me a good 35-40 to knead to the dough to a decent consistency! It's Crazy! I'm using oil instead of lard though this is the only difference. Any one have any idea why this is happening to me??
Idk what I’m doing wrong:/..im following instructions and the dough is soft and moist but they’re still coming out kinda hard when I cook them
I’ve been doing a  research  on The authentic california Tortillas And yours seems to be the best one so far. It’s taken me over 100 tries to perfect the Tortilla.  Butter Crisco and real butter mix work best for flavor. However Lard comes very close. I found that water temp made a big difference. Anyways thank you for the video it’s been very educational. You deserve four stars for that.
You are my Go To Mexican food chef. Your recipes are easy to follow and always taste great. Thank you so much for sharing your love 💘. God bless.
Thank You! I loved your first video and had pretty good success. But as a "southerner" I put the lard in as if I was making biscuits and formed that grainy mixture, instead of all the ingredients at once. I think following these directions will make mine so much better. Thank you, again!
I tried to make some flour tortillas before,  it turned like crackers 😂  i think your recipe's gonna work. I dusted much flour on the surface, the tortillas surface was like of a marshmallow.
Hi Mama thank you for the recipe I just wonder if I can use self reacing flour?
OMG this reminds me of my Granny she came from Mexico and she made homemade Flour and Corn Tortillas 😍💜💜💜💜
hello tks for your video tutorial. i just made your recipe i also came with 14 tortillas were soft and good flavor. my question is the following why my tortillas didnt fluff while they were in the comal? the baking powder is not expired and i know for sure my tortillas were not paper thin. please help i really hate store flour tortillas there not the same as homemade..
Made these. They turned out really good. I had to add quite a bit of extra water to get a tacky texture. Almost a 1/4 cup. But the end product was almost as good as yours.
You're outstanding!
Thank you!
Lard is so gross! Super high in cholesterol and not cool ar all what the pigs have to go through just so you can get lard. On top of that how lard is made is disgusting!
Wow, Cool Beans!
I clicked on this second post as soon as I saw it!
You have fat hands. Nice recipe tho
Great recipe and easy to follow! Tortillas came out great and delicious!! :)
Is it possible to “over knead” the dough? ...if so, how do you know that it’s been over kneaded? 🤔 ...I haven’t been able to get my tortillas to bubble yet. 😞
Looks yummy
I love it when someone teaching the absolute numbers/weights on cooking. I love t cook but I'm not talented at it, so when the chef/teacher said "approximately" or told to estimate ingredients myself, I often ruined the results. Thank you for explaining your amazing recipe and technique so thoroughly, I really appreciate your efforts. ❤❤❤❤❤
Will baking soda work same as baking powder? i need to work on my tortillas 😩😞
Hello.can I use stand mixer for this and if so how many minutes of kneading.thanks.
Thanks!  2nd try I used the "weight" measurement for the flour --- they came out great.  Soft and taste awesome. Very nice instruction video.  I appreciate your time to help us get a nice tortilla result.
What do you mean with hot water; do you mean boiling water? Thanx
THE BEST TORTILLAS RECIPES EVER! I WILL DEFINITELY  TRY. THANKS FOR SHARING.
Ooooo.Mmmmm. Gggggggg.! Your recipes look so Amazing! I saved a bunch of them but Somehow I lost the one about the "corn dog on steroids"!! Your husband & kiddos looked like they'd just found Heaven, my mouth was watering the entire time, and wouldn't you know...   THAT'S the recipe that Disappeared on me -  😭  PLEASE, can you tell me how I can get the recipe again?? I'm So anxious to try it! Everything you do looks so good, but That one, I was especially looking forward to making. Thanx so much, in advance, for your help.    Regards & God Bless to You & Yours,    jan
Best tortillas I have ever made.  Your instructions are the best.  Totally loving your recipes  in Belize.
Well I'm gonna try a few more times to get this right thanks for the videos.
Thank you very much, now I know why mine are always too thick and too hard.
Thank you so much for this simple, easy-to-follow recipe! I've never made flour tortillas before, but these came out wonderfully!
Grandma never weighed anything! they were excellent....Jiminy !
I’m making these tonight, I’ll tell you how it goes.
What oil would I use? Vegetable or canola?
Can we make them with out baking powder?
Make them all the time! So delicious and the perfect texture!
thank you so much for this video! my husband is hispanic and sadly his mother passed away a few years back i’m hoping to make him smile with some homemade tortillas tomorrow! my first try hoping they turn out good!
I made your charro beans and tortillas, delicious! The first time I made the tortillas they didn't didn't come out floppy like yours after rewatching your video probably a dozen times I thought the only thing I could have done wrong was not kneed it for long enough, made them again tonight and they came out perfect
This is my third time trying and this time I think they are going to come out right I was never fluffing up my flour the first two times and I was using warm water instead of hot
I did something wrong i got some gyros instead xD
fml Ive made this 3 times with oil and it wont turn out tested my baking powder every time i made in the dough felt so soft   idk im sooo sad
Thanks for the nice tutorial.
I am aware you posted this video last year, but I gotta say watching this video was so nostalgic it brought back so many memories. My grandma has dimentia and my sister and I were talking last week about the recipe and I remembered the ingredients but not the amounts. So watching you make these feel so happy and made me think about how she used to make EVERY morning before my grandpa went to work. I lived with them for some time and I would wake up and help her because I thought it was fun and honestly I just wanted the fresh hot tortilla with butter before I went to school. So I was the designated ball roller and sometimes puller or roller. My life has gotten so busy having my own family but I would like to incorporate this tradition back into my own children. Thank You for this video
Thank you so much, this video helped me perfect my family recipe with your tips. My tortillas were coming out too thick & breaking. Now they are perfect. Looking forward to more of your videos.
I will makes these for my daughter! Yummy!  What is the name of that song?        Thanks for sharing!
Anyone of y’all tried making It with extra virgin olive oil? 😂 that’s all I have lmao but I do have a question did y’all measure the oil with a liquid measuring cup or a dry ingredient measuring cup???😬
Watching you making homemade tortillas makes me want to try making them never, ever made or helped my grandma in the kitchen sad I realized that now I LOVE HOMEMAdE tortillas. Its in my bucket list to give it a try all though mine may look more like every US state im sure they would be better than store bought.
Thank you for sharing this video. Easy to follow....the tortillas I made turned out perfect!
I'd love to prep these (dough balls) the day before and leave them in a sealed container to roll out and cook after coming home from work.  Is that possible?  I'd hate to go through all that trouble and ruin them.
I'm gonna make this.. thank you. You are such an inspiration!
Question.... Can you freeze the dough, after the 15 minute resting period, for use at a later date?  Also, if you can freeze them, how long would you recommend setting them out to thaw before rolling them out? Thank you
Followed everything but maybe it’s the pan I used, anyway mine came out thick n hard lol so no matter how thin I did the flour it shrunk up in pot n was thick oh well I’ll keep messing with it. Simple recipe so no biggie
Thank you for this. How hot or what is the temperature of the water?
Hi, When You Use Shorting, Is It Crisco?  Ty, Rosie
Good job and cute little son you have
Can i let it rest longer then 15minutes ... Its just i predid everything you showed except i am going to make las carnitas y los frijoles aparte lol so everything is warm for dinner tonight... I am excited to try your recipe tonight
Quick question , can you successfully double the recipe ? I know sometimes that just does not work . Thank you !
Awesome video and very detailed in a good way  ! We have tried many times to make a good tortillas , these are the best ! You can not go wrong if you do it like she says . Very pleasant to listen to ,,great job .
First let Me give You a Big High 5, Me and My Girls just made Your Flour Tortillas, I been trying to find My Grammas recipe, and Your recipe here is it, You just brang back good memories I just shared with My Girls, also this was a good way to bring us together , because I had them come and help Me and We fried some Hot Links and rolled them and ate them, My Girls were bragging how good and fun it was, Thank You for sharing Your recipe.
this is a great video.  Thank you, and u gave us volume/weight measurements.  So awesome

Thank you!  My step children's Grandmother was Hispanic from Mexico!  She taught me how to make tortillas and so many awesome dishes!  You do it like she did and was thankful to find you. Because I needed a fresher course!  My family are very happy to be eating home made tortillas again!  It actually helps my arthritis too! God bless you! Pastor Linda Susan Brown
Hi there Mama😘😘😘 just want to ask about how to store it properly and how to make it by bulk? Thank you so much and Godbless always. I really appreciate your effort of you explaining and not cutting down the steps on how u make it.. more videos and more power. Keep inspiring us. 😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️😇😇😇
Just bought a tortilla press for making tortillas.  Can I use a press with this dough?  Thanks for the video!
Amazing.. You remade your video.. You are awesome. ❤
Your recipe has 8 oz hot water (250 ml water )?  Your video says, "1 cup hot water."
That was great!!!
This recipe is one that I want to try your tortillas came out pretty good I hope mine come out that way too thank you for sharing.
Thank you for the update. I followed your previous video. This one helps clarify the process.
She said it was baking soda but it was baking powder....
Helllo thanks so much for your teachings. Can this dough be used for pizza?
This second video is Perfect!!... & your Voice is Perfect also! 😉🙂.THANK YOU VERY MUCH!..BTW I got 14 tortias also.. 🤣🤣
THANK YOU KINDLY!!!  🇵🇷
you know King Arthur's Becky stuff it's a southern thing in California is gold flower that's it that's the only thing we have so don't go by brands because you go by brands will never make the stuff just buy gold flower and that's the only brand we have in California
What kind of shortening did you use? Any specific brand? Please help!!!!!!
Thanks pretty lady, I'm going to make me some tortillas!!
Thank you, this helped me greatly. The tortillas turned out great on my first try.
Fantastic! The only thing missing is the butter at the end, right before you eat it! link to very unprofessional video. I know what I did wrong- too thin! but they still came out great tasting! https://www.facebook.com/terri.teegarden/videos/2525445960831343/?l=7551142362979422281  (I did post the link to this video, and I'm posting this to give you feedback because I live at a high altitude, so I wanted you to know it works fine with no variation)
Mine came out great and I am living in a high mountain of Ecuador
You make them almost exactly like my Mexican mother-in-law did! She always used Crisco; said it worked just as well as lard! It must, because her tortillas were perfect, soft, pliable, and delicious! One thing she did different is as soon as she put the tortilla on the griddle, she rubbed it with her palm. She said that helped it puff better.
Hello OMG thanks so much for breaking this down for me step by step,,, only thing is they keep coming out hard,,, what I'm I doing wrong
I love this recipe! I have never made a tortilla in my life and my mom makes really good tortillas and I moved away and then wanted a recipe I could re-create that wasn’t so hard and this recipe is it! They taste so good and are so fluffy, thank you so much for showing us your secrets and explaining so precisely!! I just made them this morning so I could have breakfast tacos and I love them!!
I tried and tried and tried some more to make flour tortillas (5 times to be exact!) and my efforts never turned out. I went by other video tutorials as well as your previous video... I was so discouraged and left it alone for some time. Recently I came across this new video and immediately was excited to try again! I'm so glad I did... I got it right on the first try!!! I made more the next day just to make sure it wasn't a one-hit-wonder and was successful. I made them again 2 days ago, to keep practicing, and was again successful! A little tip/trick for those trying to make them for the first time; knead the dough in the bowl, when the bowl looks "clean" (minimal to no dough stuck to the bowl)that's about the time when your dough is ready ;-) I used that technique I saw on another video and it worked! Lastly, I make 15-16 dough balls, they tend to work out better than 12-14 for me.
I will definitely try this. Thanks!!!
Can you freeze them?
Hi Gochujang Momma ... I’ve attempted this twice now and followed precisely ... come out like bricks, no taste at all ... I’m not sure what I’m doing wrong ... I do fluff my flour ... I’m at at loss and losing confidence 🥴
How hot does the pan have to be?
I used to use a soda bottle
can i change the baking powder with baking soda? The market from my place really far away but i can't wait  😍
Omg  😠  Get to the point u F🤬 idiot 😡
Does the type of comal make a difference?
big thanks  i need pratice
My mom never measured anything and  her  tortillas were prefect and   delicious.  You never forget  the smell of homemade tortillas specially when  made by your mom. God Bess Dona Lala.
Thank you l m going to try God bless you.
Thank you so much for this video! Your tortillas look delicious!!! Smiles, Stella
i made them today and they came out perfect!! even better then my mother in laws and hers are good. these are so soft and delicious. thank u for sharing your recipe 💕
Cool, thanks, I'm going to try this when I get home. You fluff the flours before you mix.
Thanks sis,God bless u for dis   idea can I use it as shawama. bread
these are called baleadas typical honduran tortilla
I am trying to find a low/no sodium tortilla. Could I use self rising flour that has no salt?
If I don't use Lard how much oil or butter do I use to substitute that?
Hi Mama! I am from Holland, and today I made your tortilla's. They came out delicious. Your recipe is so clear and perfect. thanks for sharing 💖
how on earth can there be ANY thumbs down?  This recipe is perfect.  Turns out a soft fluffy flour tortilla every time.  And she explains it so nicely.  I'm a fan.  \:-)
Nice job! I am so happy to find a SOFT tortilla recipe!!
Hi just want to say thank you for sharing your recipes. My grandmother taught me how to make flour tortillas since i was 7 years old. We make them the same way we are from Texas I've seen other ppl make tortillas with out the baking powder and they add oil instead of lard. To have a great tasty grsndma home made tortilla you have to add lard. Lol. Thanks for sharing your videos and your great cooking talents. Have a wonderful day 💕💕😊
How do I preserve it? Or does this need to be consumed all at the same day?
Thank you for all your help! I am a Texas girl who LOVES all things Tex-Mex and homemade. I have ALWAYS wanted to try to make my own tortillas. We live in Colorado and I just can't stand the packaged ones! Today is the day, thanks to you!! This has been such a Wonderful tutorial. 🤞🏼 I can do it!
I thought self rising flour had salt already in it...
lard is the main ingredient for a great tortilla however, be sure to read the ingredients. LARD shall NOT have hydrogenated lard. Be careful with fake lards..good luck.
Thank you so much reminds me of when I was young and my grandma used to take care of me..she would make the best Mexican food..man I miss her. Thanks again.
This was great. My abuelita taught us to use our hands when flipping tortillas too. If you make them thick, you can cut them through the middle while they're hot and add butter.  I've been watching your videos for years and am so glad you're still at it. ^_^
first and foremost I want to thank you for this recipe. I will admit I cant roll out a round tortilla to save my life but they came out just fine the first time I tried this, with the only difference is mine didn't bubble up nearly as much although they did bubble some..
Have you tried using either almond or rice flower to make them gluten free?
Thank you so much for sharing recipe

will be trying this soon, but don't want to use lard. yours do look delicious and soft. thanks for sharing.
I just love you. ❤️ Thank you so much for your wonderful posts.
You are the best at making tortillas. Love your videos and your voice sounds so calming and refreshing.  Im going to try making totillias next week-i grew up watching my ma making flour tortillas  and you gave me the confidence to make them-Tim in MI
mine did not come out right ;(
I am in the process of making my very first batch of homemade flour tortillas right now! The dough is resting as of now. Thank you so much for your videos!  Hopefully mine turn out as good as yours!
Thank you so very much for this recipe and all of the detail you put into the video! My mother made soft tortillas like this when I was young...great memories.
Can you please do a  mole video?pleaseeee??
good morning... I have a question.  I have a large family and doubled your recipe.  6c fluffy flour, 2 tsp salt, 4 tsp baking powder (fresh), whisked, then  1/3c lard twice,  worked into flour then 2 cups hot water.  mixed well by hand, did not add anymore flour, combined it and let it rest.  Made into balls....there was a lot! LOL   ok so whats happened is my dough balls when I attempt to roll them out are thin and fall apart so easily...  no firmness to dough.  I rolled out 6 and gave up.  Your single recipe worked just fine.  Can I not double it?
I’ve tried recipe, the flavor taste great but they don’t come out fluffy. What do you think I am doing wrong?
Beautiful video, eloquent, and I cannot understand the 102 dislikes at this point..... Awesome!! Subbing now.
Thank you for this!
How well do these freeze?  Can I make a batch and freeze them for a week for meal preps?
New subscriber 💗 I love the oven knob covers!! That’s good to have with toddlers.
Thank you for this. Your hands are so fast! It's amazing. You've also encouraged me to finally take the plunge and try making my own for the first time because you make it clear and straightforward (though it probably isn't simple). Thanks!
I look forward to all of your recipes they're all good and I love how you teach thank you so much
Did them they're so yummy but mine don't turn out as soft as yours some of them are soft and some of them are not
How do these tortillas keep if I were to cook a large batch and put in the freezer and take out to re-heat as needed?
I grew up in East LA and had a wonderful babysitter, whom I adored, made us tortillas, refritos y queso, many many times. I would watch her fascinated, I have her recipe, but it never quite turned out the same as her's. Good, but not great. Now I know why. Lol You rock, now I am much better. Now that I am away from California and Texas, any food like this, I have to prepare. Thanks again.
Thank you for the recipe, love it will try to make. Can I substitute olive oil instead of lard, same measurement or more? I like the softness of the of the tortillas you made, just wonder if use olive oil make them harder or not & how to you keep them for few days n still soft n nice, TIA.
Thanks so much for more details it helped I made them today and they turned out amazing it does take practice for the circle put after a few tries you'll get it!!!
I was just trying to convert you last recipe into grams and millilitres. Then I found this. Thanks. Internet had said the 3cups of flour are 350g and the water is 250ml. Could have turned out too moist. I‘ll make them now let‘s see how they turn out :)
This video reminded me of my mom. She never measured. She put flour in the bowl with a pinch of this and a pinch of that. Voila! Masa!  She rolled out those tortillas like nothing. I think she had arms like gorgeous George. :) She also flipped the tortillas with her fingers. I have tried making tortillas, but somehow they're not the same. I will try your recipe.  Your tortillas look really good. Thank you.
Thank You...Success!! Very clear instructions. Mine were not as large - I ended up with 18, they were all soft pliable and delicious. I’d forgotten the long kneading and baking powder, other recipes didn’t include. I do use good lard and the round cast iron grill on an electric stove, my medium high was too high, did burn one. Munchisimo Gracias ;)   BTW Your previous video was just as clear and concise.
I used your recipe and exact measurements, Oh my, the Tortillas turned out very tasty and just the right texture. 10 + on it. Thank you for sharing.
QUESTION, WHY IF YOUR MEXICAN YOUR YOUTUBE NAME IS GOCHUJANG MAMA? IF YOUR NOT KOREAN? OR ARE YOU BOTH?
looks yummy
After you’ve already made the balls and let it rest, can you go back and add water and redo the last steps? I watched your last video before this one :/
I'm not getting any air bubbles forming and I have no idea why. I even tried putting an extra tsp of baking powder but still no bubbles.
Can I make the dough a day before and use it the next day in the morning?
Thank you for the detailed information. Looks great!
? Do you cook them on high or what temp do you use?
I just made these just now!!! and OMG AMAZING!!! Thanks for the recipe <3 <3
Can you use self rising flour and omit the baking powder from the recipe since self rising flour already has baking powder and soda in it?
what role does the baking powder play in the dough?
I 'll try this.  Thanks a lot.
I just tried to make these tortillas. Epic fail 😭. They came out like Gordita/pancake looking like tortillas. They tasted good. They didn’t bubble up though like yours do. I only had 2 cups of flour though.. don’t know if that’s why? I only added 3/4 cup of water. Pleassseeee helpppppp. Tomorrow I’ll try again exactly how you make it. Hoping I can get it right because yours look so good.
Thanks for posting this video! These are amazing, and will always be my go-to recipe for tortillas!!
I have been looking everywhere on youtube so thanks for this recipe.
Thanks mam..  How long can we store the dough in the fridge?
Third times a charm! I'm a 30 year old male on my girlfriends account and needed to say THANKS... I tried 2 previous times and ended up with crackers (which was a combination of too much flour and too low heat i believe) but the 3rd time they were perfect! Thanks for taking the time to make this.
i wish my wife was like you 😭
This is my go-to recipe now whenever I or my mom want to make tortillas! <3
Mama, I find flour tortillas very similar in shape and taste, except they are a lot thinner, to our traditional flat pita bread we used to have in the home land of the Middle East and the Golf area. As for your recipe and the detailing in how to make tortillas were just awesome and well done. They look delicious, good job!!
Your tortillas look delicious! Thank you for making this video and sharing it. Blessings!
Best recipe and easy to follow directions! I watched your previous video and my tortillas came out so soft and yummy! Thank you so much ❤
Good Lard, all that kneading sure to give you impressive muscles...
Can the tortillas be frozen or should the dough be frozen
Great Video Mama.  Brings back so many memories, yum.  I have a tortilla press, some have said don't use for flour tortilla's ..  Whats your opinion.  Again thanks for your videos.
Definitely trying this tortilla recipe out. Getting tired of the store bought tortilla. Been wanting a authentic torilla without going to restaurants to get them. I can finally make so many of these at a time and enjoy real tortilla meals. Thank you lots!
Could you please make this video in spanish🙏
Was the flour packed?
Where did you find those little dishes that you put the baking powder in?
I love your videos.  I can't wait to try this recipe sometime.
Hello I am blessed to have found your tutorials.  I'm not a good cook at all, I was a single mom always having to work. But now I can follow your tutorials and cook delicious meals for my family and grandchildren.  Thank you so much.
Could you use a tortilla press to role out a flour tortilla? We had a Mexican exchange student who left one with us but we've never used it,
Ive been making this since i was 8yrs old..I made them for my 5 bros and 2 sisters...my kids love my home made tortillas...itsl feels good to make them. 😁👍👍👍🙋
why are you use hot water? please explain.I am from srilanka.Thanks.
Thanks for making this video.  I've watch a few other very nice videos by other cooks, on how to make them, but They didn't give me the feeling of confidence to actually try to make them. Your video was nice , calm, and instructive.  I will be making tortillas for the first time soon.  And I just subscribed.  Glad I found your video :)
My mother in law was teaching (well trying to teach) me how to make tortillas. Hers came out perfect. Mine.... Well, I rolled them out thin like hers, but mine would shrink up on the stove. They came out looking more like pancakes than tortillas. Is there a way to keep them thin? Is there a cast iron thing I can sit on top of them in the pan to keep their shape maybe?
That's an interesting bowl... did it use to be a 10# can? Thanks
I love this video! Thank you!
Hi good night watching your video like every bit of your recipe I made  the Cinnamon roll and also the tortilla they came out really good thank keep sending
Thank you so much...very detailed...❤❤❤❤❤❤
No necesita el baking powder.  Se extienden mejor sin el y se inflan más fácil.
So, I watched the first video and my tortillas didn't come out very well (dry, flaky), but after watching this one - which was a lot more detailed, thank you! - my tortillas are soft and delicious. Muchas gracias!
I been trying to make this flour tortillas like 3 times and they never come out good 😢😢😢 I will try your recipe it looks easy and your tortillas looks so good my husband loves flour tortillas and im mad that I cant make them 😖 I have to buy ut from the store and they just not the same
You are amazing... thanks alot for your efforts.
I watch your video about making a tortillas at home ..right now I am trying to do your way of cooking it...thank you
You did such an excellent job on BOTH videos , thank you! Do you think these could be frozen between sheets of waxed paper? I couldn’t go through 14 in a day & wouldn’t want to waste ANY. I would also make twice the amount to have ready when needed if possible.
Just made these for my mother-in-law. She said they remind her of her best friend from Texas, who passed 30 years ago. She used to make flour tortillas and charo beans for her, whenever she'd come over. My mother-in-law tried getting the recipe from her, but she never shared. You are the queen! Thank you!
I think the climate you live in has to do a lot with how much water you would use, so it would vary.
Thanks from germany.
I love your channel! I found it when wanting to learn how to make tortillas myself, cos I hate the store bought ones, they're sour and too dense. I subbed after watching the original tortillas vid and this is the second time I watch this update. Now I'm gonna go watch how to make the burrito sized tortillas! :D
Would they come out fine if I dont have a cast iron skillet?
Thank you for taking the time to redo this video with more detail.   I’m an over 60 Mexican-American that never learned the craft of making tortillas.  Tried a couple of times but always ended up with hockey pucks.   I now know why, did not hand knead and did not use hot water.   My only problem now is that I have arthritis in my hands and it will be difficult to hand knead.   Might you know how long to leave in the stand mixer kneading?   I heard you mention something about stand mixer, but I thought  I would  ask to clarify. Just subscribed and love your tutorials.   Thanks!
Thank you for this super easy to make recipe. I made it today and it was a succes! 👍🏿
Just saw your old video a few days ago, and i'm actually planning on making these today, really lucky i saw your new version :-D   Thanks for a very thorough step by step guide! Although i always weigh my ingredients, because it'll always be more precise than volume.. as you also kind of point out multiple times!  But still nice that you describe the consistency that we're looking for :-)   Looking so much forward to trying these tonight, they look delicious! :-D
My mom has a boleo (rolling pin) made from a piece of a mop handle I sanded down. She has arthritis and its easier for her to use. I was laughing at the part you said how to roll them out even with a bottle. I never could get good ones made until this video. I showed my mom, since her recipe is a handful of this, a pinch of that. She told me to tell you to put foil under your burners ( like I know you personally.) I dont have the heart to tell her how YouTube works.
I made this recipe when I lived in Montana.  There really isn't any difference except it might cook a little faster.
Just made your recipe let’s hope they come out good porque le voy hacer mole de puerco a mi marido 😋
Thank you SO MUCH! you make it look so easy. I love how simple your recipe is. I appreciate you sharing!
Mine came out too thick and not soft. When the dough springs back too much after rolling it out (which is why they were thick) what is usually the problem? Is it that I didn't knead it enough?
Just go to taco cabana and order 2 dozen if u cant make them
Can you please tell me what causes my tortillas to taste like pancakes instead of restaurant quality tortillas? They look exactly as yours.
Well hello and thank you ... I've been wanted to thank you... I made them for the first time and they CAME OUT GREAT😀😃😄...I made a while of them and my friends love it... Thank you very much....
You have a video on making beans in a crock
You say hot water. What temp is that? Like 110 or 160 degrees?
this is great! I love your videos even more without the cut aways. This adds so much more detail to your already detailed videos. Thank you so very much! Being away from South Texas too long is making me homesick and your videos are helping me cook those foods that make me feel closer to home. I've been dying without my breakfast tacos :D
Your first recipe was already perfect,,
Very well done and damm now I'm hungry!
Okay I’ve realized that the pan makes a difference and the type of fat you add to the tortillas.  Measurements make a difference too.  It’s a science
OK SISTER I FINALLY KNOCKED THESE OUT AND THEY TURNED OUT JUST RIGHT!! I WAS REALLY HAPPY WITH THE RESULTS CAUSE IM IN HAWAII AND IT'S RAINING AND I WANTED TO MAKE MY KIDS SOME CARMEL CANDIES AND TOFFEE CAUSE I JUST GOT MY CANDY THERMOMETER IN THE MAIL BUT CAUSE OF THE RAIN I JUST REALIZED THATS A NO BUENO TODAY. SO I MADE CHILI AND THESE HOMEMADE BABIES  AND IM THINKING OK ONCE I GET BACK INTO THE HANG OF MY ROLLING PIN SKILLS AGAIN I CAN SEND SOME TO MY BOYS THEY WILL LOVE THEM! GOD BLESS YOU GOCHUJANG MAMA YOUR AWESOME FOR SHARING THIS WITH US! HAPPY HOLIDAYS TO YA AS WELL. P.S. I GOT 14 TOO. ??
Sorry if I missed this but did you butter or oil the pan in any way?
My dough never looked like that.
I am trying this tomorrow,...that's very cool you let the kiddos help I remember doing tortillas with my grandma all the time. We had our own rolling pins at her house lol. God bless you
Wow I really love the way those tortillas came out. 😋
I have a question, would I be able to use self rising  flour then the all purpose?
Great video!
Your narrative is way too condescending. It comes across as you scolding the viewer. Yikes...
Do you have to use unbleached flour?
I first time ever making flower tortillas. I measured everything out to the exact weight. Added the dry ingredients first then the lard and water. I kneading for 10 minutes. I even weighed the dough balls to 60 grams so all my tortillas come out the same size. I cover them with a damp paper towel for 15 minutes. Then I rolled out the dough balls into every State of the Union (lol). The last few I got better at.   My problems were they came out too thick and crunchy. I tried rolling them as thin as I can but I couldn't get them thinner. Maybe not enough water? I had to adjust the heat twice because they were taking a little too long to cook and then I was burning them later. My daughter said they look like pita bread.
Thank you sharing this video your recipes all us latinas out there live cook in the kitchen love ur grandma suck a beautiful person wish mine was alive miss both my grandparents love ur channel watching all ur yummy recipes share with & your grandparents much ♥️ and thank you
Yes!! Made these last night and they were delicious. I think you being more specific made such a difference from the 1st video. Some of the directions you added here might have seemed intuitive but I missed it using your 1st tutorial. Thank you so much! Your recipes are delicious. YOU = AWESOME!!!
What's the best way to store them after they are made?
Hello and thank you for sharing. I ran your original recipe just now and came out with some seriously amazing tortillas, thank you.   Question - have flour tortillas ever been made with yeast instead of baking powder? I know it would at the very least be a much longer process of resting the dough.. what are your thoughts?  I'm circling around is that baking powder as we know it was invented in 1843. Does the flour tortilla predate that? Corn sure does, but that's a different creature.
I just make my tortillas, they come out like yours,  delicious. Thank you for share this recipe 😊
I want to try these but I'm nervous! I hope mine come out even a little bit like yours! Thanks for all of your work.💗
Absolutely wonderful video. I can’t wait to try it!
Hi! I have a question!  Ive made your tortillas and they are so amazing! But if I store them for the next day, they are super hard 😞 is there a reason why? Should i just make them as I need them? How do you store your leftovers?
I'm Hispanic & growing up my Mom made tortillas everyday. You should try using a comal, it makes turning your tortillas over much easier. We don't turn them as quickly as you do, but your tortillas look fabulous & I'm sure they are delicious....😋😋
Thanks for posting such an enjoyable and informative video
I really love watching your videos. Thank you for sharing.
I'm glad you showed all 5 minutes of kneading, because I can never figure out how to knead it correctly at 3 minutes 58 seconds... or how it suppose to look like at 2 minutes 12 seconds.          *sarcasm* *making fun of comments in the last video*
Did you fluff up the water before packing it?       *sarcasm*
Question...when I'm rolling the tortillas out why do they shrink? They dont stay rolled out like your... what am I doing wrong??
You are the best teacher ever!!!! I am a 65 year old woman and have only tried playing with dough when I was 14  and it was a disaster so have been scared to try it all my life. So I bit the bullet and did what you said and am so happy. I don't think my end result was as good as yours but edible, and bendable and yummy. I also made the taco meat recipe too. I can't wait to make the next batch thanks so much xxxx
Thanks... ❤❤❤
I tried out substituting spelt flour for all purpose flour. It didn't work as I'd hoped.
Okay, tried it again this morning and they came out SO much better and even puffed up! I was scared to leave it so moist but it worked out better. Also I think you are right about the low heat drying them out. Although it was tricky to make sure the comal didn't get too hot.
mama gochujang, thank you for showing it without fast forward, cut and chop the video like others. keep up the good workl
I literally just made a batch from the first video lol I got 50% thick dry ones and so far one beautiful soft pliable one. I noticed at first my heat was too high so I had to keep adjusting the temp. I also think I needed more liquid and I feel like I only added one tsp of baking powder lmfao
Mama. I just posted a similar comment on your original video. You have a great, professional , soothing voice and your videos are well produced. You are awesome at what you do here. Thanks for sharing your abuelas love. Haters are gonna hate, lovers got'a love. Keep doing what you do. You have a new fan. Subbed. ❤
Thanks so much for giving specific details! Especially about fluffing the flour, baking soda, etc. It makes so much sense! Appreciate being able to watch the process as you describe it!
Hello  young lady,  I just wanted to let you know that I appreciate your taking the time to explain several reasons as to why some tortillas meet a tortilla demise during preparation.   However, I cannot help but notice that you have  double jointed thumbs, which may contribute to the dexterity of your excellent ability to shape the dough indeed.
How hot does the water need to be?
Ooohhhhh one tip to suggest for those having issues with hard tortillas.... Liquid measurements should be measured with a liquid measuring cup like the pyrex one you used...NOT in a measuring cup used for dry ingredients, such as the cup you used for flour. THEY ARE DIFFERENT.  It will make a HUGE difference in all recipes.
So now my only question is.... where can i buy one of those bowls?
I just watched your video.........My wife just got run off because of it.
Mine keep shrinking when I pick them up, can you tell me what I did wrong
My tortillas were not fluffy whatsoever super stiff didn’t even fluff up while on the hot pan😒 I used last videos exact measurements and this video says to add more hot water if needed so I guess I’ll try again 😬 I’m really trying to achieve that fluffy tortilla we’ll see.
I did it!!!  After watching the video twice and getting all the ingredients together beforehand, they turned out just like yours!  My problem making tortillas in the past was over flouring the work surface and not kneading long enough.  By tweeking those two things these turned out soft, pliable and tasted delicious!  I will definitely be making these tortillas on the regular!  I made mine with butter instead of lard/crisco with no issues!  Thanks for being so detailed that was the key to my success! 😊
My tortillas were hard and not flexible at all 🤦🏻‍♀️ I thought I followed your recipe to a T but now I see what I was doing wrong. Thanks so much for re-filming ❤️ I'm pretty positive I had too much flour due to packing.
I made them tonight. Followed the directions exactly.. used my kitchen aid mixer instead of kneeding by hand. Let it go 7 minuets in the mixer. Came out perfect!! Formed the dough balls by hand, came out with 13 some how..??? Put the first one in the cast iron skillet. I don’t think it was hot enough yet, so I overcooked the first one and it was not flexible at all, the second one I cooked perfectly along with all the rest of them. What a big hit these were to go along with the fresh fish I caught. We made fish tacos... damn you for this recipe!! Now I can’t ever buy tortillas again...everyone’s going to want these homemade ones.. Thank you very much for the great video and recipe. I WILL be trying many more of your recipes. Keep them coming!
Previous video tortillas didn't turn out well for me but this time I weighed everything out and they turned out perfectly. Thank you so much !
Thank you for sharing your recipe and technique.
THANKS FOR EXPLAINING AND SHOWING EXAMPLES AS YOU GO THANK YOU SO MUCH

Awesome recipe.   I am a Denver Native I live in The Mile High City 5280 above sea level I use the same recipe as you the High Altitude, as nothing to do with making delicious tortillas. Thank you for sharing. New Subbie Rosebud 🥀
If people dont know how to measure properly they need to learn you always live without your scoops
Want to tell you I love the way you cook. Your food looks great an I'm gonna try as many as I can. Keep up the great cooking
She doesn't know how to make tortillas
The first time I did your recipe , they came out okay. Now , next three times I've tried it came out like crap. I don't know why some people say it's good and others say it's bad. But I won't cook them for a long time too frustrated.
AND THANK YOU FOR SHOWING EXAMPLES AND EXPLAINING AS YOU GO THANK YOU SO MUCH
THANKS FOR SHARING STEP BY STEP INSTRUCTIONS FOR PEOPLE LIKE ME WHO CAN NOT COOK
I AM NEW THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR PUTTING YOUR RECIPE UNDERNEATH SO WE CAN HAVE IT FOR LATER FABULOUS
what is that song playing while youre rolling out the dough? i tried to shazam it but doesn't recognize it. also tried googling the name you got on the list
Thank you for your videos!! I just found you this morning !! King Arthur flour is awesome !! And fluffing if the flour is important too I believe!! And thanks for the “ don’t add more flour tip” I think it’s an common first instinct to add more when dough is wet . :) also, practice makes perfect! Yours look so nice! I’m making some later today!  Thank you and God bless .
I LOVE your channel so MUCH!
Thank you so much for this recipe I can't even begin to tell you how many times I have tried to make flour tortillas.  Thank you for your patience and explaining all the little secrets to making a delicious tortilla.  I will forever be grateful.  A total fan!! XXO
Hola hola,para hacer más tortillas osea  más de 12,sólo doblas las porciones?
Pvc pipe my tortillas look like maps of usa
Thank you so much for all these tips I really hope it'll help me make them right this time I've tried so many times and not once gotten it right once I'm not giving up lol
Thank you for explaining the steps while you demonstrated. Great job!  Also, you have a very nice talking voice!
Great
Thank you for the video. I love your technique 😍. I followed what you said and My tortillas came out wonderful. I made a small batch of eight just enough for the enchiladas I plan to make tonight.
Great details and easy to follow, thank you!
I followed your instructions exactly and tried it twice. Flavor wise they are great but I’m having trouble with the texture. When I roll them out and put them to cook they doing inflate like yours do. I’m wondering what I’m doing wrong I really want to get this down to surprise my husband with them. Can you give some tips? I feel like the texture is still off. They taste great but they don’t inflate when they cook so I know something is wrong
Thanks for the video. Great tips.
Gochujang Mamá how do you keep your Tortillas soft mine were as hard as a rock after 2 hours? How do you reheat yours?
I make mine so thick I cannot get themthin like yours. We each eat ONE and we are so full lol
If some of you want to get the tortilla or help it puff up, sometimes they dont. Be a little tough when you throw them into the comal when you slap them on there you will see that they almost imediatley start to puff up.
Momma had watched your first vid and this one love it thank you beautiful
Hi! Where did you get the bowl?
Help... My tortillas came out like fry bread. I followed your recipe to the tea.. What happened. 🙁
Hello, im new to your channel and i must say im impressed. I finally found a great detailed video for making tortillas. Thank you!!! I also watched your carne guisada video. Im from texas (but moved) and its a famous dish there. I can not wait to make both recipes.
Coconut oil work? Thank you so much for this, I'll def try it
Oh...love the video!!!🤳
Thank you very graciously ...my mother has shown me a slight adjustment to flour recipe you share and I am glad You made video because we love fresh torts,paspias etc....
Your awsome and many thanks om the recipe, my mom would always tell me "nomas por tanteo". Now my daughters will be surprised that their dad knows how to make them.
Ohh Mama so the reason my tortilla break when i try to fold them is because of the flour i used on the surface for rolling.?  But i always use about teaspoon of flour. Ive tried them 3 times and they crack up,
Now this follow up really helps. Because originally I had packed the flour and that's my my tortillas came out wrecked
Great job thank you!
Thanks for your time, expertise and videos
thank you! just rolled the balls and they are resting right now. cant wait to try them!
Hi, can I use margarine instead of lard? I am a first timer and would be great if someone would help me figure out any substitute for lard. Thanks
i am soo hungry now!!!! i love your videos! keep up the great work!
Gracias mamá you reminded me how to make them and measuring the ingredients is what has helped me finally making them correctly I will keep practicing! Muchas gracias por tu amor y compartir el amor de nuestra comida bravo!
Wowee! Thanks so much for making  this video. I had to try it out right away and they turned out exactly right. I love how you honor your grandmother by teaching me the way she taught you.
Do you use bleached flour or unbleached flour?
Best tortilla tutorial. Thank you.
These are fantastic.  We use these in preference to shop bought tortillas and the kids love them.  My daughter is a chef and thinks your recipe is wonderful.
Is lard optional?
Thank you so much, they turned out perfect!!!
Hello Gochujang mama I just wanted to tell you thank you I have had a recipe on how to make flour tortillas but alot and I just couldn't quite get how to make just like a dozen so thank you so much also I would like to add that your doing an awesome job with the videos and I really do hope you keep it up I am new and I subscribe just now don't let the stupid comments bother you your doing awesome seriously I'm looking forward to seeing more of your videos and see what other things I might learn from you it's always nice to learn new tips by the way I was wondering if you by any chance know how to make calabaza con queso ? My grandmama used to make it I never learned how to make it before she passed away and my sister passed away also so I didn't have the opportunity to ask her as well all I remember is it was cheesy and spicy and very yummy lol anyhow thanks God bless you and your family
I love you mama, i just want to meet you and practice how to make this, Ive been waiting this tutorial so long, because everytime i make this always failed, i want to try again
That looks bomb😍😍 with roti 😍😭
I made this recipe last weekend and I ...me...this girl right here...🙋made tortillas!!!!! Woot!!! Woot!! 💃💃💃💃 First time making homemade tortillas and they were delicious!!!!!!! I could have eaten them as they came off the comal! OMGOSH!!! My husband said he could hear me upstairs clapping like a seal and jumping up and down! I was so happy!!! Thank you so much for a wonderful recipe Gochujang Mama! ❤️
Hello from Michigan!  I absolutely LOVE your channel! I made your posole recipe (delish) and I'm looking foward to more! I will be making tamales , barbarcoa and tortillas next!
Beautiful! Thanks 😻
But underneath, it’s a hot mess. LOL
Hands down your best video. Smart, knowledgeable and confident in your practice of the art. You’ve been my go to gal for tortillas since i got my colombian tortilla press coupla years ago. Then hadda put it in storage,  so coming back around to the art of. But my dough never looks like yours.😭 hence the frequent visits
Is it possible to make the dough balls earlier in the day and leave them on the counter under the damp towel until dinner time?
Where cn i buy a Lard😊
Not getting air bubbles when they cook any advice or thoughts
I will start practicing tortilla making now so I can show off to the in laws on New Years!  Gracias!
Mine came out hard as a plate😕
Can you use a tortilla press to flatten the tortillas or will that ruin the consistency
Love your tutorials.Just learning how to cook a few Mexican dishes with you ❤️
my comal seems to be to cool or to hot, also how thin should i be rolling them
I was wondering why I followed your recipe and my tortillas turned into bread lol. Thanks for showing the new video, I will try again.
I know I commented once before about how happy I was with the results of your flour tortillas. I took it one step further and bought myself an electric tortilla maker.(Cucina Pro). Oh my gosh! The thing is great. Now I don’t have to spend the time rolling out the flour balls. I whipped up a batch of tortillas in no time.  I also wrap the tortillas in kitchen towels as I cook them. Keeps them warm an very pliable. Of course, if it wasn’t for your awesome recipe, I am sure it wouldn’t have been so easy. Against, thank you so much.
I can't wait to try these out for a taco night. My kids will be so excited!
great video... used your first video as a guide the first time i made tortillas....making some more tonight, will use this updated video to help me...last time they came out pretty good, but a little hard, hopefully this time they'll come out close to perfect
Why is my dough not as soft as yours in the video? I followed the exact recipe
So I'm actually very proud of myself this morning. It takes some work. But my problem was they were tasteless. I have the grinder bottle for my sea salt and I know I didn't add enough salt. Also they were kinda stiff.. I assume. I needed a bit more.  water. They came out good other then that my 1st time.
Yes thank you so much for this video.
Wheres the butter im ready to eat😳
I’m definitely going to give this a try. I had to make tortillas every day from about 11 years old till 15. They always came out hard. My brothers and sister only liked fresh off the comal. When I was 18 I tried for about a year making them again to no avail. I gave up. Since I’m retired now I definitely will have some time to practice! Thanks 😊👍
Beautiful. Thank U.
Hi Gochujang Mama! I tried out this recipe for the second time (as my first one came out like thin hard pancakes) but this one worked perfectly! Thank you for this new recipe. :D I would also like to know the title of that song you put in the background while cooking your tortillas. Pretty much appreciate it if you'd let me know.   Thanks!
Hi Gochujang mama, I’m enjoying once again watching you make your flour tortillas. I’ve made them as well using your recipe and technique and my came out amazing. Once again thank you for sharing your gift with all of us. God bless you and your precious family. 🙋‍♀️❤️👏🏻💃🏼🤗🐶
I like the fact that you added the weights to the recipe. With the weights listed there is no worry. My only complaint is the ads. I no longer watch TV or go to the shows due to the overwhelming number of ads they bombard you with. I also noticed you do not weigh the dough balls for size consistency.  Okay, my tortillas look Like aliens from another galaxy. They taste great and are soft and pliable. I was going to send photos, but there is no way to add it to the comments.
Excellent video. Thank you. New subscriber here. X from Ireland
I think you just fixed my problem with my pizza doughs seeming too dense for me--even though that's not the point of the video....  LOL!
I wish I would’ve come to your video first. Not all tortillas are created equally.
I swear I could smell them cooking! Excellent video. Thank you for sharing!!
You mentioned different types of fats you can use including oil. Would the amount be the same or less since it’s liquid? By the way, made breakfast burritos this morning with the tortillas I made yesterday. I’m a happy camper and so is my neighbor since I shared with her. Thanks
I love your recipe, it's my go-to now! Also, I've noticed that the WAY you store them helps how good they are/remain! Keep them warm and covered and eat them asap! :)
Haha ayeee thanks again lol love your videos!!!!!!!
Is it ok to use organic flour? Will it turn out the same?
I hope you are having a blessed week. Ty for sharing your recipes with us. I made flour tortillas yesterday for my family following your recipe except I doubled it, my kids love breakfast taquitos before heading off to school :). Not only were the tortillas soft but very delicious!
Just found your channel, looking for flour tortillas recipe. Going to try them this week.
will this dough work in a tortilla press??
Mama I did it.  My tortilla came out soft, edible and delicious.   Yeahhh.  Thank you thank you.  God bless you for taking time to share with us your recipes. I have also made you albondigas awesome.  😋
Are u rubbing d dough on d work surface
Thank you so much for the precise and clear instructions on how to make flour tortillas. I have been trying different recipes for a long time and with yours I have finally achieved success . Delicious. Thanks again. By the way I love all of your recipes. Keep them coming.
Hi im new to your channel I really enjoy these cooking vids!!
Amazing tortilla video! I love making tortillas, I do have my own recipe that I’m pleased with but I think your recipe get better results. I’m definitely going to try yours. Thank you for sharing your talent!
Great video..love your show
I turn my tortillas 3 times and on the 3rd time it inflates like a ball. Lol sort of. I have to use toothpick to poke hole to release air so i can pick it up. Your tortillas look good girl.
How do you know when you've kneaded the dough enough? Also, since I live alone, does the dough keep for a few days?
no fast forward watching all of it !
I am going to try this tomorrow wish me luck. 😅
Thanks for the re-do I tried to make them last time and they did not look like the ones you made =( I will try it again =)
Love the first video but also love this one too. Thank u.
Hola gracias por responder   y la palabra es polvo de hornear aca  es esa marca
My are not puffing up what is the problem please help
They look DELICIOUS 🤤. Those would be so good with some freshly made frijoles de la olla, my favorite childhood dinner 😋. Love your channel and thank you for taking the time to share and show us all your delicious receipts! ❤️
Thank you! My only issue was storing them. My tortillas came out great, but they got stale fast. I’ll try again and keep them in a ziplock bag. *How do you store your finished tortillas to keep them fresh?*
Will this recipe work to double the ingredients to make 24 tortillas? Love watching your videos.
yes,  needed this.  Mine come out like frisbees. Lol
Thank you! I made my and let me tell you, I'm soooooo happy.
As a kid my grandma would always cook tortilla's, way better than store bought, i used to help her make them. This video is great i'll use it to make tortilla's.
Hola  me gusta tu receta pero tengo una ptegunta  no saben mucho a rexal o amargo  gracias
Can Tortillas be made in a mixer like a kitchenaid?
I love this recipe they come out soft and beautiful every time. I cut my fat into the flour and then add my water and they still turn out beautiful. I even make the dough balls and freeze them and lay them out to thaw and use them as needed and they still turn out great. Love this recipe!  You rock Chiquita! 👍🏻👍🏻
How long would you say it would take from mixing the ingredients to cooking them?  They look like you can whip them up in a short time.  Thanks
Looks terrific....
Great  job!! ( I havent made these in a good  while...funny I was thinking when I was young I use to make them by scratch AMD NOW I am in my early 60's , now my last 10 yrs. of  life has change  and dont think I could make them like I use to many, many moons ago, LOL!!!)  TFS!!!
Thank you for the in depth video!
I own a electric stove and a comal, would I be able to cook mine with what I have? Btw love this recipe. And you’re right about practicing. My mom who’s been gone for two years, told me just that. But I didn’t pay much attention when she made tortillas. You rock! TFS! 😊💕🙏🏽👍🏽
Finally!!! I’ve been quitting every time my tortillas come out hard, I think it’s because I’m not kneading the dough long enough, the secret is airing and working that gluten so it’s light and chewy. My mom grew up making them every day so her measurements were always off because it depended on how much family she had to feed. As she got older she stoped making them because of diet etc and I noticed when she did them again she got tired and didn’t knead them long enough and they came out hard, she was so disappointed she stoped making them “ ya no me salen”! She can still roll out a perfect circle ⭕️ though. Thanks the the step by step!!
Thanks for sharing!! ☆
I already baked 2x and still my tortillas are hard and dry. The only difference in the recipe Is that I replaced the lard with butter based on the recipe recommendation. I followed the ingredients perfectly twice. idk where I went wrong but I have a strong feeling It was the tempreture of the gas stove. Do you think grilling them would be more easier at the same time cooked the tortillas inside and still be soft?
This us my husbands go to recipe for when he makes flour tortillas! He mixes the dough, and i roll out and he cooks them! Team work! Love the recipe!
You are so sweet for doing this. I use your recipe every time and my family loves it.
❤️👍 Excellent job, your videos make a great online reference library, I don't cook as much anymore so your videos serve as a great reminder of dishes past and how to cook them. You do inspire me too cook more though... lol 😉 Buen Provecho 8^}
I never had a problem with the first recipe! It’s my goto recipe for tortillas! Nice work
I have made several! different recipes for tortillas. and this by far is the most delicious !tortilla recipe! easy to follow. anyone looking for a great!! tortilla  should use this recipe . ❤ ❤
Thanks for not cutting away and showing the whole process. I’m definitely going to try again. My first attempt I didn’t get any air bubbles and they tasted doughy. Can’t wait to try again.
Yes this helped!  Last time I used a press and I don’t think mine came out as thin as they needed to be. Not slowing down the video helped to see how long to cook them as well. Thanks again.  I would have never never believed that I would make tortillas!
so much nicer than store-bought wraps, particularly in the UK
excellent video, very helpful, thanks!
If you don't mind saying, what altitude do you live at, just for comparison?  Thank you so much for making this video. I've tried 3 times so far and decided to give it a break because they were actually getting harder each batch. I will definitely try again this week.
Just like my grandma used to make... Thank you for the memories!
My Mamita died 8 years ago, and everyday I wish I would have learned more from her. But your videos are like I have her back!  Thank you!!
Thanks for sharing your recipe! Going to try making flour tortillas 😁
I was hoping for this video, mine was also hard and dry every time, but those actually came out great as nacho chips 😂 by your recepe of course ❤
Loved this video!
My favorite tortilla recipe since I first saw it on your other video! This is my "to go to" and have shared it with my family and friends which they loved as well.
Thank u for showing us ur secret lol I saved ur video n I'm going to give then a try
I can't believe you went out of your way to re-film this recipe with more details for your fans! You're awesome thank you so much!
I love when the tortillas puff up. I put butter on mine right off the comal and eat it up. 😋
Your video brought up a fond memory.  My dad was Hispanic, my mom was not.  When I was a young girl, they got a divorce and eventually my dad remarried to a Hispanic woman.  She could not speak English, and I could not speak Spanish.  But when I would visit my dad every other weekend, and we'd have dinner, she always had homemade Tortillas, beans, and then whatever meat, etc..  I always ended up making them into a few burritos, even if it was just the beans, cheese and sometimes meat.  One weekend, while visiting, she asked my dad to ask me if I didn't like her cooking because I was always making bean and cheese burritos.  And I laughed and said No, that I loved her cooking, and it was getting the homemade Tortillas and beans that was a delicacy to me because it wasn't something I'd get at home.  Don't get me wrong, my mother was a great cook, but since she wasn't Hispanic, this wasn't in her reproirtoire.  Sorry for the ramble, new to your site, but it brought up a memory I hadn't thought of for years.  TFS
I’m so happy I found you! My family is loving all the new recipes I’ve been making. Thanks for sharing your talent.
Thank thank you.  God bless you
Your tortilla instruction is by far the best!!! My tortillas come out perfect every time thanks to you 😘 for those who are stuggling, it takes practice!! And like she says, you want a moist dough, it's about the feel for sure! I've tried to be lazy and use my KitchenAid and it fails every time! Use your hands!
In the last video you mixed the lard in the dry ingredients throughout before adding water , so which is better ?
Perfect! Now I have to get up and make some.
Wonderful recipe. I must try it...BTW that music is absolutely dreamy, Angelica. Thank you!
Hola, soy de Matamoros, allí la proporción es de un kilogramo de harina por 250 gramos de manteca una cucharadita de sal y agua tibia dependiendo de la humedad del ambiente. Tengo casi cincuenta años que me vine a vivir a la Ciudad de México y aquí batallé hasta encontrar las proporciones. Tres tazas de harina, dos cucharadas de manteca y aproximadamente una taza o un poquito más de agua HIRVIENDO, ocasionalmente le pongo 3/4 de cucharadita de royal pero realmente no hay mucha diferencia. Suerte para las que viven en lugares de mayor altitud sobre el nivel del mar 😋
Yummy yummy yummy gordita 😉
This tortilla recipe rocks, my tortillas came out soft and tasted great. My mom never measured ingredients when she would make tortillas, but now thanks to you I have a recipe that I can follow
I want you to out of all the videos I've ever watched about how to make tortillas yours was the best and they tasted the best. I don't know about everybody else why they can't figure it out. But I did watch this to remind me.
You are terrific!  Thank you...👍
I have tried it twice and they keep coming out dry and hard. I will be more patient and try it again and not be afraid to add water. One trick I used to flatten out my tortillas, I took a gallon size zip lock bag and cut off the zip lock part and cut open the 2 sides leaving the bottom attatched so it opened like a book. I took 2 same size cast iron skillets and placed one upside down. Placed one side of the open bag on the upside skillet. I placed the dough ball in the center of the open bag and close over the dough with the other side of the bag. Then I carefully centered the other cast iron skillet over the covered dough ball. I very gently pressed down with a little rocking motion and making a circular type movement to equalize the dough into a circle shape and then press straight down then placing my fists in the center of the inside bottom of the skillet and then I will place my hands on the outer edges of the skillet like a steering wheel and press down all around the edges making sure my hands are equally across from each other. It makes a perfect circle. But, I'm wondering if I'm pressing too hard on the dough and that what might be making them hard and dry. I make sure my skillet I cook them in is not too hot. I time the cook just like you did in the video. Thank you soo much for your channel. My wife and I have learned so much from you and it tastes like dishes out of a top QUALITY restaurant but much much cheaper than eating out!!
I normally make crusts and breads so flour on the work space is a habit. I am going to try again.
Wonderful Mama.... Wonderful.
I found your original tortilla video a good while ago. The first batch turned out so well my family begs to make tortillas almost daily. I never had a meal with fresh made tortillas before. Absolutly amazing. I've subbed the vegetable shortening for canola oil. They turn out just as well. My kids love helping. Thank you for sharing your recipe.
You mentioned King Author Flour, they have or they did tips and hints on their website for baking and cooking at higher altitudes.  Or at least my King Author cookbook has it.  I have this old (1977 print date) Better Homes and Gardens Mexican cookbook and their recipe is almost identical but I think it does call for a dusted work space while kneading.  I'll have to trying working without a dusted work space.
I tried a different recipe last night. And they turned out dry and stuck to the counter when rolling out. This recipe didn't call for baking powder. Could that have been my problem.? Does the baking powder help with a softer tortilla?
The first time i made these they came out soooooo perfect and i ate the whole batch by myself.. but I’ve made them like 4 times since and they come out just hard and wrong and i have no idea what I’m doing wrong
You don't have to blame your son lol my first one always comes out messed up jk love your YouTube videos
I have found that when substituting liquid OIL for solid fat (lard, shortening) in the same quantity, it tends to get gummy.  I would have to reduce the amount of the liquid oil, maybe 1/4 instead of 1/3 (?) cup.  Again, thanks for your tips!  I think my problem before was a little too much flour, room temperature water and a tendency to over-work the dough.  BTW,  LARD RULES!!!
Are you Mexican?
Ma'ma can you teach us a easy way to made CALDO XOCHITL ?
That was my question, 🕺🏽. Thank you for you awesome gift of cooking and sharing it with the world.
Me gusta ver los procedimientos asi completos porque de esa forma no fallamos en el momento de hacer la receta.👍🏻
Love this,video! Maybe I will try again..i gave up on tortilla making a long time ago. I couldn't knead,make little balls or roll them out right! They would come out square,no matter what!(still edible though!😄) Thank you, for the encouragement!😊❤
Question if you make them how do you store them so they dont turn hard. I make corn tortilla and they turn hard but i think i will try making the flour ones soon
your'e theeee BEST..💝
I'm a chicana who has never tried making tortillas. I think i will now lol Thank you for taking the time to remake and to explain every step in detail
You inspire me to give it a try!
Does it make a difference if you use bleached flour instead of unbleached?
@Gojuchang Mama: Do you make tamales? I would love to learn how to make tamales!
I had been practicing your recipe at home, then offered to make dinner at a friend's house the other night. I was so excited to show off my new talent! To my surprise, they had NO ROLLING PIN! (I found out after the dough balls had rested 😣) So...I used an empty 2 liter soda bottle with the label on and it worked!  AND I was not familiar with the heat settings on their stove, so getting the temperature just right was trial. BUT! Because your recipe & instructions are sooooo wonderfully explained, the torillas still came out perfect! Everyone was very impressed & very full because they enjoyed the dinner so much! Thank you from the bottom of my ❤ for sharing your time and talents with us! God bless you and your family! Hugs!
Girl let me tell you that I made them and they came out so good. Thank you so much for the recipe .
Please make Indian tacos. 🙂
Thank will try again.
I actually love your original recipe on flour tortillas, best tortillas I ever made !
Oh man I miss eating fresh tortillas. Sooooo yummy!
For the ones that can't figure it out or lazy like me. The brand  "Mission" tortillas are soft and work well.
Gotta give you a atommatic like as soon as you said lard.
I’m going to try again! I think I messed up because I have a larger family. 9 people total in the household. My first attempt turned out hard. Delicious flavor but hard. Thanks for posting another video with this recipe. I’m going to try it again! Practice practice practice!!
Your tortilla recipe is the best I have tried. I always make too many..but they freeze well, and I have been known to make little pizzas with them too. I never buy ready made ones now as these taste so so much better. Thanks for sharing your recipes.
I love all your video
Thank you so much!!!! I enjoyed watching you make these. I can't wait to try them myself.
Thank You💞🦋 I will keep practicing*** Mine don't puff up like yours,lol. But I will get it. Funny I grew up watching my mom make tortillas everyday. But were only allowed to watch.  As I get older I moved, but first husband didn't like them. Now that I've been remarried my new husband wants me to keep trying. He LOVES MEXICAN FOOD* I do very well with everything else . Even breads. So I will keep practicing.
Am sorry I just had to put this out there         ..   two vids in one day dang...... You work hard
Im making this tomarrow
That was very very helpful to me!  Thank you.
I Love your videos!!!💖💜💙
Hi, wondering if this dough could be used for fry bread?
Love the detailed instructions.  My best friend's mom made the best tortillas--pretty much every other day.  She measured everything in the palm of her hand!  My friend eventually made her mom dump each handful of each ingredient in a measuring cup so she could have her mom's "recipe" 😁 Love your channel!
I miss my mom tortillas  Thank you 💞
Great tips!!! Thanks for sharing!!!💝
Very informative, very. I want to try one day, probably when I’m home alone. Less distractions. I think I’d like the homemade ones better because I don’t really like the texture of the store bought ones. Thanks G’mama!🤗🌞🌷
My dear your cooking truly fascinates me,  it is all about technique. I really enjoy the Mexican cuisine, because I was raised with it. My neighbor came from mexico and she was a great cook and teacher. I was always a welcome guest at her house.
thanks mam
this recipe will work fine for the jumbo burrito size tortillas too right?🤔 , im going to try this because my mom makes crackers and i want to show her the right way to make tortillas, she wont listen to me about the extra flour 😐 so wish me luck lol
Every baker has a different way of kneading !All good 👍
People that have naturally warm hands shouldnt kneed the dough to much" cause there actually cooking the dough with there palms.someone with colder hands have better chance of kneeding longer/ according to Grandmama..😊
Do you have a video for corn tortillas?
Lard makes tortillas or bread way more tender !✔👍⚘
I have to try this now
Mine always come out hard I will try it again 🤦🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️ thank you for this video .
Hi what happened to your green chili stew video? I was all excited 😉
Nice
