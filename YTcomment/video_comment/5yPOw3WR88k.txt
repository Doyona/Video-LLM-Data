@2:13 Gaaaaah dayummmm
Thumbs down for unnecessary intro video .
Eww
astounding upload Get Out and Grill!. I killed that thumbs up on your video. Always keep up the excellent work.
You are sent from Heaven. I’ve been craving Outback steak but I didn’t want to spend money on eating out. I followed your instructions and my steak came out PERFECT!!!! Thank you so much
How do you know she picked up the Ribeye for you? Maybe she is not satisfied with the size you give her.
I'm sorry but every steak I've ever had at Outback sucked. Outback steaks have no seasoning, and if they were seasoned it was not even noticable, dry, and very bland steaks. I can't figure out why people love them. But this looks like a great well seasoned, tasty quality steak, well done 👍👍
Sure you have no clue as to what you're talkin about I tried your recipe to the exact t and you are so full of crap if anybody else is reading this please do not listen to this man his BBQ must not taste very well
I've tried this recipe and other ones in youtube.  No one seems to be able to copy the deliciousness of the outback steakhouse.  My favorite is their bone in ribeye.  After I made your recipe, I took out my last night's ribeye  leftover from outback from the fridge and  what a huge difference. Not being rude and I'm sorry but your ingredients is obviously not enough :--((
The landing strip under your lip is distracting.
Where did you get the seasoning?
To complete the Outback process.  marinate the steak in beer overnight.  this is what makes the steak juicy when you cut it open.   Just a suggestion
The best seasoning I ever had, used at restaurants in Florida, is called "Everglades", google and order on line, the best!
Just watched this morning, made this steak for lunch. Wow the flavor is there for sure! I just put a little butter on after I flipped the meat and it was awesome! Thanks for the recipe!👍
Shits raw
Steaks are really tricky and require practice. It's a lot of fun once you get each cut's preparation, temp and timing down though. Then all your friends want to know when you are grilling next.
love it! the best recipe!
I received a MoJoe Griddle for my 50th birthday last week and your ribeyes were the first meal I tried. Whether people like the Outback restaurant or not, they should try your seasoning recipe. They were the best steaks we've ever grilled at home. The sear I got from the griddle was outstanding! Thanks for sharing!
Awesome. Making this for lunch. :-)
were did you come by the griddle top on the one you used for the steak ?
whats the season
Hey chris, how would i go about cooking a steak like this medium well without burning it too much????
What rub did you use for the steaks? It looked delicious.
Great job on that steak, but your seasoning spice is missing half the Outback spices. I work for them.
Not a steak guy here but that looked good. Just seared and cooked a Delmonico for my lunch tomorrow and it looks and smells good. Thanks for sharing.
Ribeye is my favorite and that looks just right. Nice video Chris.
You're 100% right about their grilled steaks.  They don't do a very good job grilling, I totally dig their classic steaks.  Great cook Chris!
Steak!! For days!!
Will the mojoe fit a weber 26 3/4?
awesome job on your flat top grill.a nice cook brother.The Pitmaster always gets the biggest piece for running the Q.nice looking steaks.
Look at the size of that Ribeye!!! Dude, your wife hooked you up!!! That was a great looking ribeye Chris!
Chris- You and I must be simpatico!  I just cooked my first ribeye on the Mojoe Griddle last weekend and I was amazed by the seared crust and juiciness inside!  Great video!  Cam
Way way better than Outback Chris. High five for your wife for picking up some awesome steaks!
I don't have a Mojo, but I do have an Island Grillstone to try this on!
I'm a sucker for rib eye and I've never thought about cooking it like you did. That crust looks perfect!
Love the cook. .. but never had a good meal at outback.   Keep on rocking out that mojo!
Awesome looking steak Chris, never eat at Outback but those looked like they might be better. Cool looking shirt!
i love that mojoe thang, looks like they  have a  new version that the sides are  inclined so you dont spill grease all around your Q.  Now were talkin !   Killer steaks my brother !
Looks Good Now I want a steak...
I all-ways use hot plate or griddle as you call over there for steaks , that seasoning you used is just about the same as I use Cheers Glynn
Mighty Fine looking Steaks..Cheers
Your steaks look great Chris! I have to honestly say that the outback restaurant sucks.
dern that was one fine looking ribeye!
Yum looks amazing and I want some of that!
Yeah you made me crave a big, fat, juicy rib eye. This looks delicious and TY for sharing.
Excellent.  How authentic is the seasoning?  I've seen the same recipe except with 8t. of salt, assumed to always be kosher salt and not table salt.
Never thought about using the Mojoe Griddle for steaks, but after watching this, that is a must do!!!!  Steaks looked perfect Chris, and what a crust!  Thanks for the shout out brother!  The shirt looks great on you :D
Did you gnaw on the Bone Sir I know I would cheers
Ohhhhh Chris...Chris....Chris!
Excellent Chris look at that char!  My family took me to Outback for my birthday and I got the wood fired sirloin and it honestly sucked!  Next time I wanna go out to eat I'm going to show up at your door step and have you cook the steak!  Great cook!!
how is this different than grilling it in a thick pan on gas?
yup!
