How can I make a lemon buttercream?
Thank you very much!
November 23 from Switzerland
Thank you for sharing. I'm watching from South Africa. Thank you so much.❤
Go free 😅😅d😮😮d😅f😅f😮
What’s with the nuggets
This is just plain old American buttercream. It's definitely not the best, but it is the easiest. My preferred buttercream is Swiss Meringue Buttercream.
I thought my butter had the right consistency to start with and I beat it up for 5 minutes as per the recipe but it did not fluff up. I beat it up another 5 minutes and still could not get the right consistency. Not sure why?
❤❤❤❤
🎂🎂🎂 your video is the best
I love this video so much. It is so detailed.  Thanks a bunch ❤❤
Please cut the music, thanks.
I can't find that butter anywhere now! What else can I use? I used to find it at Waitrose, but, alas no longer sold there. Anyone??
I couldn’t find my recipe book and I’m on a time crunch. Came straight to this video again. I appreciate your tips and tricks. ❤
I just made this for a chocolate cake I had made. It is the best frosting recipe I've ever made.  Thank you, Jemma! I knew I could count on you!!!❤
Thank a for the amazing recipe !  I’ve got a question, in slightly how weather after decorating my cakes with that buttercream is there any possibility for it to melt ? And lose its shape or texture? That’s my only concern
Anybody watching in August  2025? My favorite  baker
Hello! Question here!! Once you apply the buttercream or pipe the butter cream, will it hold its shape for a while? Like a day??? Needing to make a cake this weekend and I have to make it a day ahead of time.
Thank you! 🎉❤
Doesn't the buttercream melt at room temperature? Likeif i baked cupcakes technically i could keep them out for 5 days?
How could I modify this to make chocolate buttercream icing please? 😊
How much butter cream do I need to make to frost a cake please could you get back to me asap I’m making a birthday cake for my sons birthday today  x
Next time. I will use less sugar.
Thank goodness you are across the water, because I would be at your bakery everyday and weigh over 200 pounds. 😊❤❤❤
Hi. So glad I stumbled across this video today, I am now on a binge fest of you channel. I do want to ask, you mentioned using icing sugar that has maize/corn as the agent, is tapioca starch ok as well? I just checked mine in the pantry (Australia 🇦🇺) and it has tapioca but does come out a little grainy when I make buttercream... I haven't tried with your method/recipe yet. Thanks for the tips ❤️ 🎂
Thanks for the tips
My old buttercream frosting recipe uses boiled brown sugar and no icing/powdered sugar.
Can you freeze your butter cream please? Enjoyed watching you
Wow 🎉
This is my go to recipe for years, the thickest and best kind, I am not a fan of those airy frostings
What is this Sookia 😭😭
The only thing you can say 😮 about this is how much money is being spent 😊😢😢😢😡😡😡😡😡
Can cream cheese be added to buttercream?
someone on tiktok is selling this basic american buttercream for 15 pounds! I dont mind buying funky battercream recipe bcs it is her original recipe but selling basic american buttercream recipe is such a rip off
Awsome and so precise, thank you very much 😊
I’m stoked to be back again. I had to leave baking for a few years. 👍 Jemma is an absolute gun.
I HATE THE METRIC SYSTEM!! I DIDN'T LEARN IT IN MY SCHOOL MANY YEAR'S AGO, AND EVERYBODY NOW USES IT!! AAAHHHHH !!  😠
It was very helpful but i wish people made video's wo we could watch the chsnge process of the butter. I feel like thats where i got worried.   After 5 minutes of blending it didnt cream up and change, t took a decent 12min before it creamed together. My buttwr must if been judt abut colder. Then when mixing rhe icing micture once sgain it didnt cream together and klumped together untill i used a k mixer and added 1tbps of milk and vanilla then 2 more after that. After that it was some how able to cream together and look like whopped cream
I still can5 get my butter to whip out white and ive gone past the 5 minute mark. Do i keep whipping? Its nit as fluffy. Help 😢
Thank you so much ❤
Can this same method be used to cover a birthday cake or it is only for cup cakes. Forgive me if im asking a silly question, i am a very dear beginner.
🎉
I LIKE IT❤🤘
U look so pretty and despite your accent i understood each spoken word
my butter cream forming is alright but i can sense the sugar powder under my teeth despite i sifted it twice😢 is the butter cream texture like this or i am wrong in my steps?

What a super helpful vid, thank you. I’m making a cake for my daughter, and will be following your techniques when I ice it tomorrow 😊😊. brilliant to see such beautifully fluffy, pure white buttercream… and now we know how!
Talking over food add so much salivary spray. You should wear a mask when cooking and speaking!
I want the buttercream no get hard in the fridge, how to do that
YOU ARE THE KINDEST BAKER I'VE EVER MET LIKE LITERALLY NO ONE EVER SHARES THEIR RECIPES ❤❤❤
What would you recommend for using salted butter like anchor butter?
Hi Jemma, what's your advice if I want to make a chocolate butter cream? Thanks ❤
You saved me
Cakes made of them
Cake 🎂 and the same
Is this butter  cream good for cakes
What can make the icing had or strong
could you use ethrytol or xylitol instead of icing powder sugar which is really unhealthy
Hello Miss Jemma! Can you clarify the translation of the measurements? I found 150g of butter is Approximately 3/4-1 full cup of butter. Also I found 350g of the confectioners sugar is approximately 1 3/4 cup. Is this correct????
How much buttercream would be required for your layer cakes?
where did you get that’s colour from please.
Where can you get authentic food colouring from pls 🙏 most of the supermarkets doesnt have a quality one 😔
Love the tutorial. Please I need know how to do a birthday cake especially doing the cream or icing on.
Omg! Thank you so much
I feel like she must be German. Lol.
Hi Gemma how do you not get lots of bubbles in your buttercream beating it for that long❤
Very educative thank you!
Hi Jemma, can I use the same amount of butter, but reduce the sugar?  Thanks
Amazing
Very good👍
Thank you
Could I use double cream instead of milk? I found it helps better with the thickness and smoothness
Is this a crusting buttercream?
Yo the best ❤
Hello.. Do you have sugar paste recipe?
What brand of butter is best to use for buttercreams here in UK? ☺️
🙋🏻‍♀️👌🙏🏻❤️
This buttercream recipe would last in the heat? If not, any suggestions?
Does anyone know If I should follow the same instructions when using a hand mixer? Please help!
With the measurements in this video how many cupcakes can i cover with buttercream?
I would love to live where "emergency baking situations" occur :)
How can I make it chocolate or with a flavoring
🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤    YOU   FOUND  MY   KRYTNITE   =  damit
I don't know what I expected from a frosting almost solely made of butter and sugar, but I sadly found it borderline inedible. It's so sweet I actually had to spit it out when tasting even though I have quite the big sweet tooth and liked things with buttercream that I bought in the past. Sadly I don't know how to possibly save this, what a waste of ingredients.
🎉
3 cups
I am making birthday cake for Georgia, my great grand  ;she wants all pink/tell me recipe in cups
Very yhanx
So refreshing to have clear instructions. There's nothing worse than tutorials where the host is talking with that weird youtube accent, you know, where every sentence goes up at the end, like a question.  Thanks.
I’m always confused with measuring
I have watched many buttercream videos and yours is the first that actually give really good tips and tricks that work! Thank you, and I like your tats, very clean.
Wow!  you're video really  helped my 13 year old  daughter to make her own  buttercream. BRAVO Madam🎉.
Can this buttercream be used to pipe buttercream flowers??
I made buttercream for the first time ever and used your recipe. All good until I added milk and all the mixture became curdy. I freaked out and luckily I found someone who explained how to fix split buttercream. It finally worked but all the process costed me 2h... Not sure what went wrong.  Could you please make a video explaining how to troubleshoot buttercream? Thank you!
Hello. I made your recipe and it was perfect. The only problem was that i feel sugar granules when i eat it. What I did wrong or what is the solution? ❤
Thanks a lot❤❤
Hi, thanks for the fantastic video. Could  I use this butter cream as the base and just add in some coco powder for a chocolate icing? If so would I need to add more liquid to counter the addition of the dry coco powder to avoid a grainy texture.
That's amazing! Did you try using stamps for decoration?
May I suggest that you speak slower?   The sound is out of sync with the video so "reading your lips" is out of the question.   You have an (accent to anyone that is not from your region) making it difficult to understand you.   Andyouspeaksofast thatyourunwordstogether, makingitverydifficulttounderstandyou.
Always thought you had to you use the whisk.  Two different whisks, one with more wires failed to catch and mix most of the butter.  Bought a cheap hand mixer that was very weak and tiring so was  about to buy the breville hand mixer.   Will try the paddle 😂. Thank you
This is great for cupcake but my question is, how many batches of this would I need to make to say fill and cover a 3 layer 8" cake? Thanks so much 😊
why does my icing have air bubbles in it?
❤
Thank you so much
should milk be cold or room temperature for buttercream icing?
Excellent demonstration
When using electronic. Mixer do I use paddle attachment or regular beaters?
how did you made this food colour
i'm really sorry but i think i'm doing something wrong my belt got butter and sugar and everything all over it i was trying to beat the butter like you said but i feel like i'm doing something wrong.
Can u take ur class slowly 🙏
🎉🎉🎉
Can you share in cups and grams.. I don’t do grams!!
do you add the food colouring with the milk and vanilla extract or just the milk and food colouring without the vanilla?
Thanks so much for this video
Is it okay to powder the sugar and use it if we cannot find confectionary sugar?
Hi just wanted to know hw to preserve these yummy icing cream as  lil worried about the stiffness n hardness of the cream. thx
This is the best buttercream recipe ever!!! Thank you so much!!!
Yum😋
Thanks very much for sharing
I hate recipes in grams
Oh thanks I really search the a icing buttercream like that ❤
I'm making a sponge cake so need to know how to make butter creme for that

You can use rock salt for the icing. I saw a bag of it today and it said it was for de icing
Your explanation is very clear thanks much
How much fat content in butter that you are using
Store at room temperature...why not fridge ?
Plz ingredients in grame
Can you overwhip buttercream?
Hi could you Maybe write the recipe to that buttercream?❤

Thank you Jemma. Please how many cups of buttercream does not his yield? Will it be enough for filling and covering a 2 layer 6" cake?

My country is so hot how to maintain the butter not to melt..?
Hi Jemma! Can you tell me how much buttercream you'd make to ice a three tier cake?
I just made this icing with your vanilla cupcakes and they turned out amazing!!! The BEST buttercream EVER!!! Me and my family can't stop eating them! 😂 Thank you Jemma for having our back with these recipes, they are always incredible!!! 🤩🍦🧁
When should you use this type of buttercream versus swiss buttercream for example and why?
Can't wait to do this 😊 love it 🎉
Jenna,if u can see this know that you are cute as a bug & your eyeliner is just beautiful. Those people r so rude and they should have left bc they don’t deserve your free good advice. 😊
That's a lot of sugar. Can we reduce the amount of sugar used without affecting the end result?
Do you use this recipe for cake frosting inside as well?
so   how  are   your   rain   bow   rolls 😮
superb
I know this is an old video Jemma, but is there any way to make the buttercream taste a teeny bit less buttery? Also can i use tuns of whipped butter? Will that matter?
Nice👌🏻... Can we reduce the sugar... Pls?
Recipe
Nice
I make icing like this but dont use the same amount of icing sugar, definitely at least half the amount that majority of people use and always turns out fantastic and not sweet 😊 love all your baking videos 😊. Im making my daughter a unicorn cake gor her birthday tomorrow so have a lot of buttercream to make!
Could u show me how to make it with shortening alone?
I made the recipe and the cream is not very smooth. I can feel the pwdered suga not disolved. And it is too sweet. Any suggestion ?

Try this recipe yesterday.... it's too sweet omg
Just made the cupcakes and butter cream from your recipes.  Turned out amazing.  Thank  you Jemma.
When I add gel paste food coloring my buttercrea, it curdles/splits color and turns grainy (used red and black). Any suggestions to keep buttercream smooth yet have a rich color? Is it a paste quality issue?
This really helped me out and it's wooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo AMA ZING
Believe it or not, I used a teeny-tiny amount of liquid food color and it did not change the frosting.  Here in the US, we have a type of liquid food color that is highly concentrated.
That Viator commercial stinks like rotten bananas.
Very helpful!Thanks
So 10 minutes of whipping? Isn’t there a point it ‘collapses?’
I couldn’t understand what you said - maize sugar vs tricalsium …?
What's the difference between butter cream and the royal icing
Thanks sis❤❤❤❤
Sorry I tried making this but it was grainy. My butter was softened, sugar was sifted, milk added and consistency was great. It was just.. grainy. How do i rectify this 😭
?can  you use regular vanilla extract for butter vream
I was just wondering how you would adapt this recipe to make it chocolate butter cream?  Many thanks
Good day I live in the tropics and frosting melts what can o add to make it more stable please
Is this good for piping flowers please?
Thanks so much it didn't be white till when I put the milk and vanilla and almond extract and it's so nice tasty and fluffy very easy to use not runny thanks so at last I got a good buttercream frosting ❤🎉😊

Jemmy help!!!! No matter what I do my buttercream won't firm up enough...its really runny 😢 I add extra sugar, I chill it, to no avail... I'm in England so it's not hot weather 😂😂
Thank you so much…this is helpful
The buttercream was way too sweet, I would put in a lot less next time 😩
Hi..clear explanation..tq❤ Do you refrigerate the buttercream or keep in freezer for next use
Hi from PH
Very nice
What did you mean by looking for a different icing sugar? Is they’re a certain brand to get?
The camera focuses much on her face instead of the main topic of the video.
Thank you for this amazing recipe! Can I add strawberries for flavour and colour. I would also like to use this on a wedding cake. How long can I freeze before covering the cake. Many thanks
Thank you Jemma, this helped a lot. But I found this too sweet. Any other sugar to butter ratio available ?
Love your videos, I’m a novice at this. Can you give me an idea how much butter icing I’ll need for a 9” double sponge cake please? Filling and full icing?  Thankyou Annie
I try doing it but I can feel the sugar when I taste it 😢. My buttercream was on room temperature . I mix it for 10 min more or les after adding powdered sugar. I don’t know what I do wrong 😑 Can you please help. Is it always like that ? Do I supposed to notice the powder sugar when I taste the cream ? Or it have to be completely smooth?
Beautiful
Hi Jemma, thanks for this tutorial. I am going to make a Unicorn cake. Will the fondant eye lashes stick to the side of the cake with out falling off the buttercream. I am in South Africa and we have temps of about 27C ? i have followed your tutorial on the Unicorn Horn Ears and Eye Lashes. Thank you
What is the white liquid , is that milk?
Hello! I need a help.I'm new in UK. So, in UK where I can find all kind of baking products?  Please suggest me!  Thank you😊
Means altogether 15 min beating the buttercream and if I do that even ten min it looses it's water n all ruined  ... Wat is the time right before water released from it n I must have to stop
Can you use this butter cream for decorating cakes as well?
thank you 👍
Emergency baking situation,  you could also put your block of butter in a bowl of Luke warm water for 5 mins.
Hii Can I prepare the buttercream the day before?
Great video thank you! Could I get the quantities for an 8" cake?
Its soooo sweet, way too sweet for me but its easy to make.
Thank you for this recipe. Over the last 36 hours I have made 5x your vanilla buttercream recipe and 1x your chocolate buttercream for my nieces first birthday party. I made her smash cake and the birthday cake for alot of people and it got alot of compliments. A friend (who is a trained chef) who attended said its the best buttercream she has ever had (and she hates the standard buttercream). THANK YOU!!!! Your recipe made a very happy group of people here in CA ♡♡♡
Is the milk room temp? Or cold?
Wonderful. Thanks  for the lovely information.
Hi, I am a beginner in baking,I live in a hot country, I like to know which frosting is used for commercial cupcakes, & which one will withstand long time without melting, because I need to prepare some cupcakes for near by exhibitions
Hello I'm 66 yrs old I can't learn this gram weight etc for measuring.   Is it to hard to use English American measurements ?  Appreciate if you can thank you n Happy New Tears
Hello, i tried to make it from a diff recipe but my frosting got too curdly snd i could crunch out the icing sugar😭so why does it happen??
Kindly can I use blue band if I don't have butter?
Anytime I make icing now I come back to your video 😍 tastiest icing I’ve ever made! Got loads of compliments last time! 🥰
Hi Jemma, If I want to make buttercream for 8inch birthday cake. Can I have the exact measurement for butter, icing sugar and milk ?? Thank you very much . 😘
How much buttercream I should make for 4 , 8 inch cake
May I put in in fridge?
so you beat the colour outta the butter😂
How many cupcakes will this recipe make?
can I use powdered Sugar as a substitute for icing Sugar?
Thank you very much.
Hi! I’m a newbie at buttercream! Won’t it spoil at room temperature because of the milk???
Did you said hole milk?
Top tip: use the defrost setting on a microwave to soften butter, it's much harder to offer soften or melt
Hello, can I use a cream cheese icing instead on a cake that I want to decorate by adding fondant decorations on the sides?
How much ingredients should i use if i need enough to crumbcoat and do final layers to a cake? The quantity listed in the description didnt look enough
Thank you Gemma. I love your recipes.   Can I just ask about the butter, my butter never seems to go soft enough even when I leave it out overnight, I don't have a microwave, is there another way to soften it slightly?  Thank you xx
I totally love making (and eating) cakes, and cream is the most important part IMHO. But I still can not accept that somebody is able to eat a cream which is based just on butter and sugar... a LOT of sugar. I don't mind eating unhealthy things time to time, but this looks incredibly fatty and sweet and also there is no imagination in that :)
Can you freeze buttercream icing
Very helpful thank you - is this recipe good for icing a layer cake or is it just for cupcakes?
Noob veido
Measurements only needed . Please mention that
Do you have online class
Can I replace the butter for shortening?
No machine. Can I do this by hand?
I LOVE BUTTERCREAM but i absolutely do not like that background music T_T
Love this recipe! Thank you. My Buttercream ended up somewhat grainy though even I sifted the powdered sugar. Any tips how to fix?
I only have liquid dye. do you think it's a good idea to incorporate it instead of milk to prevent the cream from being too runny?
Wont it melt if the cake was placed in a not so cold room or area?
❤
Can I ask how much butter cream icing is needed for a birthday cake
How do you make black buttercream
Pretty interesting
*150 g squeezable unsalted butter* - Beat for 5 minutes *340 g powder sugar* - Sort out through sieve - Add 1/2 of sugar to butter - Add second half of sugar when the mixture is nice, smooth, pale and whippy (cca 3-5 minutes) - Mix another 3-5 minutes (preferably 5) - Mix *1/4 tsp of vanilla extract* with *3 or 4 tbsp of whole milk* - Add just as much vanilla milk to your mixture as you need - With the vanilla milk add any flavours and/or colors you'd like - Speed the mixer up and beat for 3 or 4 minutes, just so the mixture connects well with the vanilla milk (and flavours and colors) - After a few minutes scrape the sides and check consistency, if need, add milk, continue mixing
I love your voice! You sound like Spence from Pretty Little Liars.
Will this do without mixer?
I'm going to try and make my daughters birthday cake. She wants pink butter cream all over I don't have an electric whisk can I use a hand held whisk? Thank you
I only have liquid food colouring because colour paste is expensive.
How do I make black butter icing
Thanks so much for all the great details! Since I’m no English native speaker, I’m a bit struggling with what you’re advising from 3:04 to 3:10. Could you maybe write it down in an answer? Many, many thanks :)
When I’m using sugar powder I feel crunch in my icing
I love this recipe, but the conversion to us seems to have got lost. Hope this helps   For the butter, 150 g = 0.695952717563                              🧁🧁so 150g ≈ 2/3 cup       🧁🧁 for the Powder Sugar,  340 g = 1.776385617948                🧁🧁so  340 g ≈ 1 3/4 cups🧁🧁  Again I <3 this recipe, so easy and so good  🧁🧁🧁🧁🧁🧁🧁🧁🧁🧁🧁🧁🧁🧁
What is the ratio of butter to. Icing sugar for butter cream
I love your videos you explain it very well
Can use salted butter?
The only time you don’t want to have “crispy nuggets”!! ;)
My butter cream always gets soft while piping and dies not hold shape can you help ❤️💕❤️
I did this buttercream icing and it's so good!! Thank you!!! 😊
What is the brand of the colouring?
I am doing a three layered 6 & 8  inch cake. Do I double the recipe or triple the recipe?
This cream is way to greasy and strong to my taste. I have tried it. But this really is too strong! My preferance is with cream cheese instead of butter.
Thank you for being so selfless Jemma
how many cakes does this ice and can i double all the ingredients to increase amount?
I tried it and it was too soft what did i I wrong?
And there you made it again!! Thanks to you and your tutorial, my 3 years old daughter had the best mermaid cake ever!  THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU A MILLION YOU ARE A SUPER STAR! 😀🍰
I made this buttercream today to top the chocolate cupcakes I made with your chocolate recipe.  This buttercream was fine in the bowl until I tried piping it on the cupcakes.  It is not stable when piping in hot or humid weather.  It was literally melting in my hands as I was trying to pipe it on the cupcakes.  It needs a stabilizer.  When I make this again I will either substitute one quarter or half the butter with vegetable shortening or I will add some meringue powder to the recipe.
Fantastic presentation but I must admit I was getting a bit of headache with the background music and trying to follow you. I know this is an older video so I'm hoping the other videos don't have music and dialogue at the same time. No issue with music when the presenter is not speaking.
Meant what speed do you beat the butter on?
Please, what speed do you beat the on? Thank you for any replies.
If i take 1: 2 ratio too much sweetness .how u choosing 1: 3 If i make fine powder also cream is fine crystal.i don't like butter cream
Plzzz koi urdu ma bata dy kindly
Urdu ma videos nh ha
I live in Australia and we have pure icing sugar or icing sugar mixture, being pure powdered sugar and cornflour. What do you use. Thanks
I've tried so many times. It comes out soft and doesn't set on cake. It starts melting after I put on cake
Great tips, thank you so much! You've answerd all my doupts and question.
You are amazing,,
Tried this today and although I had the butter a tad too soft & the less good icing sugar, I’m pretty pleased with it. It’s a coffee buttercream filling for a coffee/walnut swiss roll & I realise now that I was going to add a square or two of melted dark choc (but forgot) so I might drizzle a little over the top tomorrow before freezing & slicing it, to cut the overall sweetness (the walnuts will do that too). I’m about to order your colour pastes & vanilla extract as a summer treat 💖😊💖 ps I’m taking a few slices of this up north to my elderly aunt on Sat when I accompany her for an mri scan
How long will this last in the fridge 🤔 x thank you
My buttercream got watery 😔
I've cooked for year and taking classes..you explain so well, this left me confident.  Thank you so much..
Wish your measures were in cup measurements
Just found your channel , THANK GOD ‼️
Any advise for making this ahead of time and freezing it? how would you defrost it?
When you show some one hi do do something tell us hi many cup of confection sugar so we will no ok .
Thank you, you saved my day ❤️
This taste like licking a stick of butter. It is soooo awful
Should the milk be room temperature or cold?
I'm back again 😂 this is the best white frosting ever! I absolutely love it! I'm using vanilla beans tonight ! I have made this multiple times and everyone loves it so now I make 3 batches and always have extra for ppl because it's that good ! Thank you Gemma
Okay, it's just occurred to me I bought spreadable for a holy communion cake.. 🤔 I think I need to keep popping it back in the fridge til I'm ready to spread 🤔😅
do i really need maize starch or could i use tapioca or corn starch
I’ve tried many time but my buttercream was too soft but i live in Thailand do u think its becoz of the weather, need suggestion pls xx
Your coloured buttercreams look Fab and so do your tattoos!  Thank you for explaining everything so nicely! xxxx
You talk very very fast my english isn't so much good
Jemma this is the best buttercream recipe that I’ve made! It was a complete success at my 4th of July party. I’ve never made a buttercream with the right consistency, taste and perfect to be colored!
Very interesting, I will give it a try.
Does salted butter and or the quality stop the icing from being pso white? Mine still had a slight yellow cast?
I've heard that when increasing the quantities in baking you can't just double or triple quantities...is this true?
As this recipe has milk in it, does the cake/cupcakes need to be kept refrigerated?
Been watching for years and always wanted to try the Buttercream as its my weakest point. Tried it this way. OMG!! A spreadable buttercream. Mine wasn't as silky as I expected. Too many air bubbles. My mixer is not the best so I think I overmixed by a few mins. But still a 100% improvement on what I normally make.!!!!
What kind of milk do I  use
why does my buttercream not look so smooth  i have done all you did
Thank you ❤️
this cake looks simply delicious your baking videos are absolutely captivating, and i truly enjoy the audio-visual experience thank you
How do you make icing that isn’t to sweet
Has anyone made this and know about how many cups this makes
this is the smoothest butter cream ive ever seen
I love the way this lady talks, an of course the great recipes!!! ❤️
love the perfection and the quality of cooking
If you were icing an 8 inch cake what would your measurements be please ?
I made this buttercream and it came out perfect!!!!! The only problem was that I didn't have Vanilla.... so it tastes like sweet fluffy butter which isn't so bad honestly lol. My buttercream is fluffy, smooth, and just yummy :) I followed the directions to the "T" I used Land O Lakes butter not sure how good it is but I mean I guess it does the job. I also used a "hand" mixer. Super sadly it does not have the Wisk or paddle but it got the job done. I can only imagine with the proper mixer the results are top-notch! I also used generic Target powdered sugar which is what I had at the time along with the butter.  I didn't see either of the ingredients mentioned in the video but it seems to work just the same. I'm practicing for my daughter's sweet 16, I'll be making her cake, fingers crossed. I haven't piped anything yet with it, a bit nervous but maybe later today. Point is Jemma's recipe and instructions are spot on. I am a 99% beginner and I am super excited with how it turned out!! Thanks so much, Jemma Cupcake :)
F, you talk to much. I've never seen a baker full of tattoos.
Im going to make iT for school i hope iT wil become very good
Subtitles please 🙏
I recommend cupcake Jemma
There’s also been a video on tik tok going around that if your buttercream still isn’t white enough, add in a tiny bit of purple gel food dye and it’ll cancel out the yellow!
BRILLIANT!!!
Would a hand held mixer have the same effect?
do you add more icing sugar if the mixture is too loose ?
Will it work with semi skimmed milk please? Great video. Trying to master creamy buttercream.
I just want to be her friend.
Where i live, I really only have access to margarine.:/ And all the butter is expensive....I notice no matter how much I whip it it always has a slight yellow tinge. Could it be due to the margarine?
Hello, Does it matter if using a whisk attachment on the stand mixer? Or is the paddle type like you are using best? Thank you!
very cool
Can I use condensed milk instead of icing sugar?
Can you please give recommendation on good butter to use.
Can we use hand mixer for 5min it beat the butter?
OMW........ I can't stand watching that which grosses me out. I don't like to be grossed-out by a piggy when I'm learning about food.
Is that yummy because I didn’t watch the whole thing
Thanks🌷
I love your videos and have made lots of your recipes but I can't see anywhere how much buttercream to make for a four-layer 8 inch cake - please can you give some measurements or recipes for buttercream for your cakes? Thank you.
I was wondering I spend 6 months in Dominican Republic and six in Canada but in Dominican the buttercream always melts on me what can I do and what buttercream is best to use in hot places such as Dominican Republic?
I make this buttercream but I half the butter with copha (vegetable Shortening) also at room temperature it stands up much better in hot places so if the recipe asks for 200g of butter it would be 100g butter 100g copha
Please make a video on what to do with leftover buttercream. I'd always have some leftover and it's such a shame to throw them away.
Hi Dear, Why you talk so fast I can’t understand 😿
Love this recipe thank you Tracey
Welcome To 138 Rosewood Way, South San Francisco, Ca
This recipe in cups and spoons: 3/4 cup butter 🧈  1 and 1/2 + 1/4 cups powdered sugar sifted 3 to 4 Tbsp milk 🥛 or juice 🧃
thank u for the receipe from this mesurments of butter cream how many cakes are made form this butter cream?
So what's the difference buttercream icing or frosting? This is what I used to make "frosting"(powdered sugar,unsalted butter,milk n vanilla extract)
I’m assuming milk needs to be room temp
I need help
I’ve never made cupcakes from scratch.  Always used box mix.  Does anyone have a good recipe now that I know HOW to mix and bake. Just need a recipe.
Tried this recipe and my buttercream turned out separated and almost melted. Any tips??
Wow this is so good!
Pls can I do butter cream by hand without ,whisking machine.and is the milk compusory
Jemma help in few days I need to make a cake and I buy some royal icing in like a pot but I am not sure if I have to use it just like that or do I have to blend it with butter please help🥺
I tried it: The consistency of this butter cream was perfect, the recipe worked well. However, if you're not English or American, but used to a more subtle taste like in most of Europe, you won't like this? This is so sweet, that you can't taste anything else. All the flavours in your cake or cupcake will be killed by the pure sugar and sweetness of this. To me, personally, the sweetness was sickening. It's not how we make cakes or toppings in Austria. There's no buttery taste left.
Yum thanks for the recipe I am totally gonna make dis 🤪
I’m super excited to make this next week using this video :) thank you!! Do you have a video with cupcake recipe ? Thanks :)
We’ve followed your recipe for buttercream and it’s really good. Only problem we have is when we pipe flowers there appears to be pockmarks in the frosting. Just wondering if the mixture is too stiff or it’s air bubbles getting in. Any advice welcome 😊
I did try making it before amd I failed :') It tasted like sugar
Hi. I have been trying to make the butter cream but everytym it turns out to be Not stiff. Its really disappointing 😥😫. I can't even decorate bcz it fall off and even gets smudged, please help
Can i use gel color to it?
Three things, Jemma, one-do you ever freeze your butter cream? Two-If so, do you think it’s possible I can use my food saver to freeze the icing for future use? And three-how long can it be kept in the refrigerator for?
Can this be apply to big cakes
I tried it and they came out wonderful.  Thank you for your tips.
What paste do you use for the colouring please
Will definite use this recipe from now on😊 its not too sweet, isnt it?
What I like to do with my butter cubes is "squish test" them. If they squish between your fingers and it only feels cold for a few seconds, they are right for the buttercream lol
Homemade buttercream frosting my name is heather ha me and nathan Lyons my
Thank you so much i love it
Thanks for sharing 🤝 thanks
Buttercream frosting recipe?
Can anyone help me what she said about choosing the right icing sugar..i m not able to understand her accent and i really wanna know about it...someone please reply for my message..

This is the only recipe that i've watched about 10 000 times to be honest, works every time! xx
Your detailed explanation is simply superb and informative..
Why you talking so fast!!!!
Love your professional technic.
You need to start over with the right amount in English.
How about saying the exact amount,like,1cup2 sticks of butter?
Thanks for the easy recipe and great tips!  I used this to make spritz sandwich cookies.  The cookies were flavored with just a little zest, then I made the base buttercream and split it in half.  One half was lemon cardamom and the other was rose cardamom.
How big a cake will this amount of buttecream cover please ?
Emulsion?
Excellent simple short & detailed video, TY.
Followed your instructions to the T... Perfect result and thank you for the recipe! I'm about to create a paw patrol cake for my grandson!! Wish me luck!!!!!
Thank you CupcakeJemma. Would you give me  tutorial how to make whipe cream without whipping cream or heavy cream due to in my country very difficult to reach out and expensive.

What Icing sugar would you recommend?
Love your recipes. Do you have less sweet recipes? 😬
Hi, I use your buttercream recipe all the time for my cupcakes but I can never get the right amount for my 6" cake to fill, cover and pipe, can you help lease?0

Can you not talk grams, and talk cups or spoon please
Thanks sooo.much nice butercream.🙏🙋
thnx for sharing Chef Jemma
I am in the US & I'm looking to convert from grams to cups. I have Googled and I have different answers to this specific recipe. I know I need 1 stick of butter & half 🤔 Confection Sugar 2 cups (that's a lot of sugar for me) and as for Milk, it says 3-4 tablespoons but on the video that looks like a cup and more. Can someone help? Thank You ♥️
Could you tell me how much of this cream would be enough for how large a cake?
A tiny drop of cyan food dye will make it look whiter if you don’t have the patience to beat it long enough.
Please confirm... use half the liquid if making this icing for Russian Tips? And, do you have the recipe instructions written anywhere? I see only the 3 ingredients listed. I tried to write instructions following your narration, yet not sure I caught all the tips. I will need the details when I circle back to make your icing again sometime.  Thanks!
hi I have tried your butter cream a few times but it always curdles when I add the colouring have you any advice thank you

Does it need to be refrigerated?
Hi there! What would you convert 360 grams icing sugar to when using Australian standard cups? Thank you 🙏🏼
Does anyone know how much of this you would need to make for a 4 layer 8inch cake, for layering and 2 coats on outside?
Why does my buttercream taste so buttery
Hi jemma Even after using icing sugar in buttercream i feel very lil bit of sugar garannieness in my mouth. We Indians basically dont eat any cream instead of whipped cream. So it it normal or if not then what to do
What is the different about this recipe and those with condensed milk? Going to make cupcakes and piping them for the first time. So I'm totally lost what buttercream to do 🙈

I made this and my customer called and said it’s falling away from the cake. This  cake is sitting in a fridge. I drove 1 1/2 hours away to repair. I don’t know what I did wrong. Do you have any idea what I might have done?
How long can you store the unused buttercream and can it be put in the freezer?
Hi Jemma! Tried to make buttercream frosting and it came out very pretty on the cupcakes. The only one thing is that it’s so sweet - not eatable for me. Is there any other frosting I could use for cupcakes which I could colour to? I’ve noticed that Ermine frosting doesn’t combine well with colorant. I used gel. Please help!
Been doing this for 40 plus years...your whipping entirely way too much. You didn't tell them about it separating if they whip it too much.
The butter should be very cold from refrigerator?
Tnx for this recipe.. can i use it underneath of fondant??
So we don't need eggs in our icing?
sHE TALKS way way too fast!!!!

Thanks for this. Also, what about if I wanted it more of a deeper blue? Like a Royal Blue? I added a lot of colouring and ended up with runny buttercream 😭 please help!!!
Amazing!!! I just stumbled across this video and really enjoyed watching you.   Clear and straight to the point… keep it up!
Hi Jemma, I recently subscribe to ur channel..and startes trying all ur recipes..but i have tried your butter cream recipe 3 times now but everytime i get a runny buttercream which doesnt hold its shape..any suggestions..

Hi, can you please advise about maize powder because here they sold separately, how much gram should I add to the icing mix? Thank you.
Everytime I make buttercream frosting it comes out a bit gritty. It feels like the powdered sugar doesn't incorporate properly. I follow the recipe to the T. What can I do to make it smooth?
Imperial conversion plz?
Should we beat the butter for 5min on high speed??
Hi Jemma.  I was writing a note to you with some questions about your fabulous buttercream recipe. I think I inadvertently deleted the note before posting it here, so please pardon me for multiple inquiries if there is another post besides this!    I made a single recipe of your buttercream (enough for 12 cupcakes), and thought it was out of this world.  But now I need your help.  I am baking a 3-layer 8" cake and want to fill and ice it with your buttercream.  How many recipes will it take to frost such a cake?  Can these multiple recipes be made all at once?  If so, does the powdered sugar still get added in 2 parts, or should it be added in 3 or 4 parts?  Does a large batch require longer beating time at each step?  Thanks in advance for your response to this inquiry.  Peggy
How much buttercream do you make for your 4 teired cakes please
You explain so clearly
Beat butter for 5 minutes... Where do you find this patience? Lol.
Does it frost?,I'm in hot region
I don't have the type of colouring, I only have food colouring so what should I do, do I add different amounts of ingredients?
I know plain supermarket butter is above 82%
I love your haircut 😍
I'm a bit late to this party but I have a question, san this buttercream be frozen? I'm guessing if it can be frozen it should be done BEFORE adding the milk?
Is this buttercream just for cupcakes or does it crust enough to use on cakes
Спасибо большое
I really like this recipe however I feel the grains of sugar… I use icing sugar and it is sugar and maize. It whisked for more than 15 min and still feel the grains. Any advise?!? Many thanks!!!!
Can you change to UK butter Jemma?
👌
Does it make a difference if we use a hand mixer instead? Since it doesn’t have a paddle attachment
My icing melted before I got to the milk 😭
Why are British and Australian youtubers so much better? Consistently more concise and informative. Is it just less narcissism?
Please also add the US measurements
I don’t think I ever tasted buttercream as it should be, so I don’t have a reference. Is it always the case that you feel the icing sugar between your teeth? Just a bit gritty and sandy. Or is it a sign for not incorporating it enough into the butter? Or maybe the icing sugar I used isn’t great for buttercream? Any advice?
i want learn butter cream
I made this recipe and it was delicious! So thankful for the tips on how to make it perfect! I feel like I have mastered buttercream icing lol many thanks! Namaste.
Can I use this to cover a cake
Making some right now and it’s looking good Following your direction
Hi Jemma, how much buttercream would I need to fill 8” and 10” three layer sponge, using white chocolate ganache on out side ? Thank you
What is the temprature of the milk?
Hi there, what is  the name of colours ?
Is it too sweet ?
What measurement of butter
Just wow
In order to avoid sugary grains in the frosting, What should we check on the sugar ? It was not clear.
buttercream is becoming grainy. what to do for that?
When i leave out the on i made it doesnt look right
Would you share which icing sugar brand you use? Ive tried silver spoon, Tate & Lyle, witworths and Aldi’s own they all turn out with a grainy texture :/
Does this recipe crust, it’s also hot right now how stable is this recipe. Thank you.
I saw some bakers put a purple food color like small Amount to lighten up the yellow color. Hope this helps ❤️
Is it a boiled milk
Have you ever tried condensed milk buttercream?
What mixer is that. I see it's a Kenwood kmix. Just curious what model
Can you still use this method of getting white buttercream with non-dairy butter? I can't get it to go white. Having allergies sucks sometimes
Looks delicious, I was always told to use the whisk attachment on a mixer for icing. Does it make much of a difference, does the wish add to much air. Why do you use the paddle.
Trying this for father's day! Thanks for sharing
The background music looks familiar just like odd bods I guess 😂😂
Use gel colours

Hi Jemma! I have a question hope you can answer my 1million question that i’ve been struggling to find the answer. I tried your method and your buttercream recipe but in the end my buttercream looks greany, not smooth silky. It’s like the icing sugar was bot dissolved. I put icing sugar in 3 batches, the first batch looks alright nice creamy smooth but after the second and third it’s getting worse. I added milk bit by bit but still not fixed it only made it runny ☹️. Do you know why? Please help. Thank you very much. I really loves your content and always search on your channel to dind some inspiration..

I like your speed of talk
Love your tutorial on how to make this frosting. It amazes me that you don’t have confectioners sugar splattered on your counter or clothes! Very helpful. Thank you!
Instead of icing sugar can we use condensed milk for butter cream used under fondant
Hi can you recommend a icing sugar, I’m using silver spoon and the agent is tricalcium phosphate and it does face a kind of Sandy taste
Used this recipe to make frosting for my first attempt at Russian piping tips. It worked beautifully. Thank you.

Is this is a good recipe of buttercream to use in icing a cake, either crumbcoat under fondant, or just as a finish of the cake?
Can you use whipping cream instead of milk in this recipe?
Is it possible to reduce the amount of sugar to make a 'less sweet' buttercream? Will it affect the final result?
Your Awesome! Your Macaron recipe  was the only one that worked for me! Now I shall use this Buttercream Masterclass to get the perfect filling for my Macarons!
I hate this chicks's accent and she speaks way too fast. And who here lives in a hot country? lmao
Hi Jemma, how can I stop my cake mix from curdling after I've added the eggs? I've tried adding flour, but it makes no difference!
Can I use this recipe of butter cream to coat my cake? X Btw you’re amazing ❤️
HERES THE WHOLE RECIPE AND INSTRUCTIONS  Recipe for Buttercream:  2/3 C Butter 2 3/4 C Powdered Sugar (Sifted) 3 TBS Milk  Use softened butter, beat butter for 5 minutes until whipped and fluffy. In a separate bowl sift all your powdered sugar. Slowly incorporate the powdered sugar into the butter half of it at a time and let beat for 5 min each time. When finished, add in bits of milk until perfect consistency.
How much buttercream to cover and 8” cake before fondant
Would love to know why my buttercream always gets riddled with air bubbles if I whip it too long??? I use a paddle attachment so it's not that. I whip my butter for 5 mins before I add any icing sugar, once I add the icing sugar and whip it a while it's just full of air holes and not smooth at all. So frustrating
you can olso use a spatula to make a nice icing
How about halving the ingredients?
Quien pudiera traducir esto por favor!!!!!
Jemma plz do a master class of whipped cream icing, lots of best wishes to u, love u 😘
Hi I have been doing everything as on the video, but still found that I could feel small grains of icing sugar in my butter cream. Should I try to beat it even longer than 5min with the sugar to help it melt?
Why does my buttercream always go soupy? Could it be because I use 59% fat content 🤔?
Perfect buttercream for 12 cupcakes -150g unsalted soft butter Beat for about 5 minutes until pale, smooth and silky  -340g icing/powdered sugar (soft) Sift at least once prior to use. Add half the icing sugar they beat for about 3-4 minutes so incorporated and then repeat. (Beat on slow to mix briefly then mix on medium to high speed).  If it is too stiff you need to add liquid i.e 1/4 teasooon vanilla extract and/or 2-3 tablespoons full cream milk. Add liquid in parts in case you add too much. Beat again for 3-4 minutes so all mixed in.   If you want to add a colour, colour paste is best as it is more concentrated and won't change the consistency of the icing. If you want it all the same colour add it in with the milk and the mixer will mix it all for you. If you are doing multiple colours, mix the paste with a small amount of separate buttercream then add to the bowl as it is easier to mix it in (the paste can be quite thick).  Always keep it covered when not using. This buttercream can be stored for up to 5 days in an airtight container if required.
How do you stop the eggs from curdling?
Look beautiful can u converse the gram to stock and cups pleassseee
Hello 😊.. thank u very much for ur recipe . I will definitely try . But does the buttercream do melt in room temperature ? Outside the fridge I could say and if it is doing hot here like in summer ..  Thanks 😊

3:05 😦🥴 say wah
Can't find any icing sugar with maize starch instead of tri phosphate in the UK 😔
She said something about the ingredients of the powdered sugar. I've listened twice but can't quite catch it.
What if one doesnt have mixer?😎
Can I freeze and use my buttercream later?
Erm I used your recipe this morning and in my mixer it was a great consistency and taste yummy. When I put it in a piping bag after colouring it, I couldn’t get it to squeeze out 🙁 so now my cupcakes look like pink and blue poop emojis 🤣
I don’t have that attachment on my mixer :( can I just use a whisk?
Thanks Jemma for always referring to places that are not similar to the UK:). Excellent guidance, many thanks

Hi, I need to make 2x 8 inch cakes each with 2 tiers. I will be putting buttercream in each layer and covering the whole cake with buttercream. What quantity of butter and icing sugar do I need please? Thanks xXx
Gemma, I love your recipes and results. The one thing that is getting me down is converting your UK measurements to my US measurements. I'm just not confident I'm converting these measurements correctly.
Can you use this to make buttercream flowers? Or do you have a different link for that? Thanks!
How much would i need for an 8 inch 2 layer cake??

Do you HAVE to put vanilla in the milk?
Please give the measurements in cups and ounces and pounds instead of grams. Google will give you several different answers for the same question. I need to know how many CUPS of powdered sugar not grams, please. Thank you 💚 ✝️

Thank you for the video.  I used to always make it with cream cheese and it would water it down so much I was not able to use it as frosting, I could only eat it with  spoon.
Hi Jemma, thanks for the great videos, they have been a huge help.  No matter how I try I follow your instructions to a t but it is still grainy, what icing sugar would you recommend please, thank you
Such valuable tips & ideas! Thank you
Interesting that you are saying to use a maize starch icing sugar as anybody else working in the industry are complaining about Tate & Lyle for swapping to maize starch as anti caking.
This was so helpful for me as a beginner .., well explained !!!
I did your white chocolate frosting for cakes. Yummiest ever. Thank you so much. Very good demo. It's soft and pale exactly shown in the video. Making it today again.
This is so helpful. Thank you.
I don’t listen to anyone with all those tatoos
I made this and the consistency was perfect... but it came out really sweet. If I add less icing sugar would it mess up the consistency?
Thank you so much for this!🙏🏻❤️

If we don't have a mixer, can we use a hand mixer?
You talked about liquid and gel/paste food coloring, but what about powdered food coloring? I've made cakes for family member's birthdays but my buttercream always turns out weird and doesn't hold it's shape no matter how much frosting I put. My birthday's soon and I really want good buttercream this time. I live in a little of a hotter climate, so maybe that's why?
I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS
Nice 👍
I want to make orange flavour icing can I put juice from an orange.

I'm using this recipe for an 8" 4 layered cake. And I have no idea how much buttercream I need... The recipe is for 12 cupcakes.. but don't know how much I need for layers, crumb coat and to cover it fully with buttercream.. any help??
In place of icing sugar can we use sugar substitutes which are available in powdered form.
What a great masterclass! Thank you!
Thank you so much

Can I use your recipe for cakesicle & cake pop crumbles too? I live in a tropical country. How much milk can I add to the butter to avoid runny icing? Also, I bought a jar of whipping cream. Can I use this too? Thank you, your new fan from the Philippines ❤️ 😊

Would this recipe be enough for a dozen cupcakes?
I now know what I've been doing wrong this whole time. Beating 5 minutes after each addition of sugar, then adding the milk. I was taught to add sugar, then milk, then more sugar, then more milk. Gemma's way makes more sense to me.

Please help! Can this buttercream be used under fondant?
I love how she considers the hot countries <3
Try Fantasia Fondant, you won't regret it.  It is a very forgiving fondant with a long work time, which makes it easy to work with for beginners and pros.  Fantasia Fondant is formulated with elasticity making it a high performing fondant when covering cakes or performing in silicon cake molds.  The colors of Fantasia Fondant are vivid and fadeproof.  This fondant will not prematurely dry, crack, tear, break and 'elephant skin.'  Offers a less sweet taste that resembled a homemade marshmallow fondant.
If I want to make chocolate frosting, at what step do I add the cocoa powder?

Me watching video in peace  Video’s subtitles: pervert
Everytime i made buttercream, it always turned out runny or curdled, never right. But i tried this today and this turned out PERFECT !

Thank you Jemma for this amazing recipe. I used the Tate&Lyle icing sugar and the texture wasn’t as silky as I would have liked. Could you specify which icing sugar and which butter you used for this recipe? Also at what blender speed should I be running to soften the butter initially and then to whip once the sugar has been added?
If doing chocolate cream when would I add the chocolate powder

Hiya I've followed your receipe and when I ice my cake my buttercream seems to go into bubbles when scraping off excess.?? Thanks in advance
Gonna try thiss❤ thanks for the recipe
Kannst du das auf Deutsch bitte bitte ?
I dont have mixer so can we beat it up with spoons
I tried making buttercream but it did not come
Has anybody that has made this know if it’s too sweet?? All the buttercream recipes come out waaay too sweet and so instead I have stuck with cream cheese frosting. I would however like to find a buttercream frosting recipe I would actually enjoy
The highest fat butter I can find locally is only 35% will the icing still turn out okay?
Can I use margerine instead of butter?
I really love your videos on cakes. There is this one thing that I can't understand,  in my place of practice I was told buttercream cakes are only put in the frigde only after crumb coating so as for it to set before the finally frosting and after which its not good to put back in the fridge else the buttercream will come melting once its out of the fridge. So why then in most cake tutorials including yours I have seen buttercream cakes go in and out of the fridge without fear of melting even after hours. Or was I misinformed?? Thanks.🙏💃
👍👍
Is there a way to color it blue without using artificial food dye? Its my birthday in a week and I NEED blue.
How does one reduce the butter taste
Love your confidence and your explanation 🤩🤩
Am I the only one who constantly fails at making frosting like it’s frustrating at this point
For Americans... maize starch is corn starch (which is the only thing I've ever seen in powdered sugar, state side anyway) EDIT: I found that ORGANIC powdered (icing) sugar has tapioca starch!
Is this stable buttercream
another way to bring anything to room temperature (eggs, butter, milk, etc) Put it in a bowl and then put that bowl in hot water, or put the hot water in the same bowl as the ingredient if it's like eggs.
Ok
Lose the background music please!!!

Hi Jemma,  I live in Miami, Florida and it is so hot here.  I have a question for you... I want to make buttercream but I am afraid that it will be too soft and won't hold.  Do you think I should use half butter and half icing shortening or stick with just butter?
This was such a great video!! it really helped me with my buttercream, and my cupcakes turned out great. The buttercream was honestly the best part!!
I tried your recipe it came out good but while tasting it I can still feel the icing sugar. What is going wrong with it? Can you help me with it? Thank you
In this lockdown i decided to learn Backing and cooking and your channel helps me a lot.

Why use unsalted butter?

Thanks  for  showing  but  1pakat  ice sugar  how  money  gram  butter.
Hi Jemma,wondering if your icing sugar is what we call “pure icing sugar” or an icing sugar mixture which in Australia is a soft icing sugar.Im attempting a wedding cake in a couple of months and have a request for buttercream frosting.Thanks for any advice.😀
I have just tried it now and i have added 250g of icing sugar instead of recommended 340 g but still its too much sugar. Feels like eating sugar. Apart from it, the consistency was good for piping.  I disliked it because it was embarrassing in front of friends because of too much sugar.
Hi jemma can you teach me how to make a perfect butter cream for hot weather so that it will not melt when i put it on my cupcake 🙂 thank you.

Jemma from Agents of Shield😳🤣🤣💛
My buttercream always falls apart, I have tried almost 5 times and it has never achieved a good texture. Maybe because of the hot temperature( I live in India) but after every 5 minutes of whipping I run across my kitchen to put in the freezer for 10 minutes before whipping again. Always starts nice and creamy and it ends up grainy and looks curdled! Any suggestion Jemma?
Jemma, please next video ditch the music. I prefer the sound of running appliances!
I tried to see if someone asked this question but didn’t find it. What if you use salted butter instead of unsalted?

Is anyone else watching this during coronavirus just trying to do something to pass time
Hi
Found your channel today while looking for buttercream recipes because I want to make a cake for my birthday on the 9th of June. All your recipes and methods are the best by far and I'm definitely tagging you on IG when I make it
Thanks for the video.  I make loads of buttercream for macarons which require different flavorings (raspberry, strawberry, blueberry, pistachio, nutella, the list goes on).  What I've found is that the buttercream technique is basically a trial and error technique to get the right amount of flavor, color, and consistency.  Each flavoring requires a differing ingredients levels and you basically have to work with it to get it to come out right.  This video for me, in an of itself, does not produce the "perfect" buttercream but is a good place to start.    Just one other note, I live in the south in the US and you definitely can't leave your butter out "overnight" especially in the spring and summer and use it straight up -- the recipe will totally fail.  The temperature and the consistency of the butter when you begin the cream in my opinion is single most important characteristic of the method.  This will highly depend upon the temperature of your kitchen.

me im stuck here makeing cupcakes
first professional i’ve seen not using a kitchen aide mixer lol
Hi! Does this buttercream crust? When I make it from scratch and then go to eat the cupcakes I’ve iced a few hrs later it’s had this crusty coating, is there a way to stop that? Also I see you don’t add salt to cut the taste of the sugar why is that? Does the salt make it crust?
It’s actually so nice to watch a video made by a British person no offence to the Americans but your voice is much easier to listen to and even thou your vid goes on abit a didn’t get bored thankyou 💚🎀 xxx
Can I add melted chocolate or powder instead of vanilla extract ? If not what can I use instead ? Thsnkyou
mine didn't become smooth.  idk what I did wrong-_-
This video is SO helpful. Thank you, Jemma. Completely changed my relationship with icing, lol xxx
Very good technique. Very easy. I must say this is very useful for me, whipping cream is quite expensive where I live.
Does it matter what kind of mixer I use? Can a hand mixer create the same consistency?
US Measurements are as follow:   150g of butter equal 2/3 cup  340g of powdered/shifted sugar equal 2 3/4 cups
I love her accent 💞😍
Thanks for sharing♥from India😊
Hi .. not sure why i follow the step but i can feel grainy to my buttercream . can you please help ?
i leave my butter for room temperature . however i can feel the butter is a bit cold although butter already softed 😀
Brilliant.... very helpful
Can you over mix buttercream?
Wow 🤩
Hi jemma do u use warm milk or cold milk or just room Temperature milk?
I can never make buttercream in my electric mixer. It just pushes the butter to the bottom of the bowl and then mixes nothing. Is it because my butter is too soft? Can only seem to make buttercream when using hand mixer
Thank you so much for this video! I've never been able to make a decent buttercream that tastes as good as I imagine in my head. Now I realize that I'm just not beating the butter enough. I'm so excited to try what I learned here today. Also, thank you for all the tips you've given us. I'm off to see more of your videos and subscribe!
Awesome video! I've made buttercream a few times and gotten compliments but I always felt I wanted it a bit lighter and fluffier. Never thought to go that long with just butter in the mixer before starting. I start vacation tomorrow, I hope everyone is ready to live on buttercream for a few days while I try this out!!
Hey there @CupkakeJemma! I have watched some of your other awesome videos, and this one is great, too.
Help! Do you not mean try and find icing sugar with tricalcium phosphate INSTEAD of maize starch? I’ve read so many article on how pro cake makers are furious with the brand Tate and Lyle for switching TO maize starch because it now makes their butter cream grainy.  I’ve just searched high and low to find one without maize starch and now I hear you say this 😳
I have got a hand mixer will that be fine?
Hi! Everytime i make butter cream frosting it becomes all separated and weird. But it all happens when i add the milk. Why is that?  Can i opt out the milk? (I live in sri lanka which is a tropical country with a temp of 35 Celsius

Hey Jemma, I hope you are doing well and so is the baby. I tried this buttercream recipe and works well but I can still taste those sugar granules in my buttercream.

Looking forward to your reply, Thanks! :-)

I feel sugar crunch.... Do I need to beat more...????
use clear vanilla extract...not brown for white creme ...
Thank you very much. I watched both your videos about how to make the perfect cupcake and the perfect cream aswell. Glad to say both came out perfectly although I think I may have put too much in each cup so they widened a bit but. But still although they are my very first cupcakes I am happy about them. The cream in my opinion is a bit too sweet but together they are really good. I put actually 4-5 tspoons of milk.
Hey is it possible to use a hand mixer instead of the stand mixer for this buttercream recipe?
Tried this butter cream today. Came just as 👌 perfect. Thanks Jemma . Love your baking
I am from India and it is summer here right now..
Hi,  I stay in place where the room temperature is about 35 degrees Celsius. so while i am making the buttercream, its becoming almost oily and hence i had to use a bowl of ice cubes beneath while whisking.. is there any alternative ingredients or method which can help in this situation. Kindly let me know. Thank you
This was so so helpful, thank you so much! ❤️

Hi jemma.. can you just suggest a method to sustain the consistency of buttercream in a tropical country.. I'm in Sri Lanka and the butter cream is melting like nothing even if we add little liquid. Please suggest a method.
Is there anyway to lower the sweetness in your recipes? They are so easy but super sweet.
For how long can it be stored  if there’s still balance in it ..... and should we store it in fridge or room temperature

Perfect job well done dear 👍
what speed do you beat the butter for 5 minutes? Does it matter!
I'm so stupid, I didn't know BUTTERcream frosting  had butter
Hi Jemma Love your cupcake recipes and am very happy with the results. Just having getting the right consistency of the buttercream a bit of a challenge. I keep trying it but can’t get it right. It’s not smooth and am scared adding liquid in case it gets runny.  Any help on how to get it to the right consistency. Thank you 😊
So delicious......thank you...I have been looking for a great buttercream recipe for a while....
Try this chocolate buttercream icing  https://youtu.be/X0Sggp0izNg
What are the proportions if you wanted to fill and decorate a 20 cm cake of 3 layers?
So much sugar. 😒😒😣😣
Jemma OMG, this is truly wonderful. Thank you! I live in France and my daughter had a particular idea of what she wanted for a cake she has made for her colleagues. This butter icing worked out really well, even if we did use semi-salted butter. We added vanilla and a teaspoon of lemon. It's fluffy, smooth and silky. All thanks to your excellent, simple and clear explanations! <3
After using buttercream in the cake can u keep it in the fridge for up to 6 hrs....
My butter cream texture was gritty.  Why?
Its so hard to do in Australia, it's currently  70% humidity. I have to pull mine in and out of the fridge during making it so keep the temperature right
hiii Jemma.. i love your tutorials on cake.. im learning soo much .. i would love to visit crumbs and doillies at soho shoppe soon.. i look forward to seeing more videos..
Thank you..
She's rocking  those bangs👌

How calories  1butter cream  has
Do you refrigerate before using on cake?
Would this be enough buttercream for a 4 tier 10” cake?
Remove the whistling!!!!!!!!
I knew you were going to be British the second before I opened the video
Can this buttercream be used for painting cakes ?
Hello Jemma, so,I tried this recipe, the taste came out gr8 but the consistency wasn’t there. The buttercream came out liquidy and not fluffy. I believe I had the right consistency of the butter(not to soft or hard, squeezable and it was holding its shape). My question is I have a old school blender, it’s  an enclosed one, and your device is a mixture and open to air. Does using a different gadget make a difference in the outcome?  Because in your video after you had mixed the butter for 5 minutes, you mentioned letting it get some ‘air’, what exactly do you mean?
Conversions to Cups: 3 cups powdered sugar 2/3 cup of butter 3-4 tbsp milk  and yes, i noted the fact that butter and sugar weigh different
Just wanted to say thank you! I actually made my first batch of buttercream icing, and it came out great. With everything being shut down because of COVID, I’ll be making my daughter 2 year old birthday cake. I’ll be tipping it with YOUR buttercream icing. Thank you!
Can we use salted butter for this recipe
I just taste sand in my mouth
Please share with me your recipe? Thank you
I made this and it turned out so well! While I was sifting my powdered sugar it felt like a lot, and it was a lot! It was a bit stiff before the milk but it turned out perfect once I added it. My buttercream had always been off, but this was so helpful for a beginner! I never knew whipping something for so long could make that much of a difference! Thanks so much!
I wish... buttercream didn't have so much butter buttercream didn't have so much sugar it would be easy to use liquid color
I want to make a 4 tier 8" chocolate cake following your receipe and fill with choc buttercream how much buttercream do I need to make, this recipe is 12 cupcakes but not sure for a cake?
Thank you Jemma, love your recipe. It was stressful having to convert everything to US measuring system. It would be awesome if you included it in the description box. Thank you!
Best buttercream I tried!!!
Should we use hand blender for making butter cream? 😅
Thanks for putting the recipe in the video description and not forcing us to some website, like a lot of other baking YouTubers do. This is super helpful, thank you!
🥰🥰🥰
Thank you . You saved my day
I made mine but it came out liquidy
Does the milk need to be in their and why ?
Seriously this is some of the best buttercream I ever made! I just added chocolate raspberry coffee into it and it came out as a beautiful subtle flavor as well as red food coloring to emphasize the raspberry!!
Can't you just use normal butter??
I reduced the sugar to 200g it tasted alrightbut it might be because im a person who lovs spice..
How to not get the butter smell
I tried making this and everytime it goes grainy after I add the milk and vanilla extract . What am I doing wrong?

How old are you
I love your accent ❤️ And by the way I’m French
Is your buttercream heat proof,meaning can it stay outside for 1 or  2 hours
Great video..  I have a question  What is the difference if we added  Condensed milk instead of licing sugar?  Thank you.
is it normal to slightly feel the powdered sugar in it when you eat it? the city i live in is kinda warm too so It doesn't help! like I can't feel the sugar but like ever so slightly can? like it' snot like just regular cream. tho my stepsister insisted in making it on the runny side despite me saying it won't turn out well xD maybe that's why
Can i use this buttercream for dedication on a cake?
I love watching you making cupcakes and buttercream. Your awesome 👏 🤙🏻
Can this be used for covering the cakes as well?
the vanilla extract looks like molasses.  I've never seen high fat butter.  Interesting.  Thank you.
this is a really detailed amazing tutorial thanks :) a lot of places just say "wack together room temperature butter and sugar" but never explain in detail what consistency you need. i guess part of my issue was that our house is slightly warm and room temp is hotter here xD
Thank you Jemma for the recipe. Today I will be making this butter cream again for the fourth time.
Can you use evaporated milk instead?
how many cupcakes does this recipe ice.. thanks
Glad to see you made American buttercream, so much better than Swiss or Italian buttercream which doesn't taste good.

When I always try to make buttercream it ends up tasting only like salted butter🤭 I will give this a try though 😂
Hi Jemma, Thanks for the video. Do you recommend using heavy whipping cream? thank you
Hi Jemma, not sure if you'll see this, but if I were to make raspberry buttercream, am I supposed to be mixing raspberry goo instead of the milk to loosen it up? Or is freeze dried raspberry the best way to go? Thanks 😘
Can we use non dairy milk?
Hate that whistling music. Annoying and unnecessary.
Your recipes just amazing. I have just make my first ever buttercream with your recipe and absulately stunning. Thank you for sharing such priceless knowledge. Much love...
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻❣super!!Thank you!!!
Why am i getting recommended this in 2020. Not once have i youtubed anything about cakes or icing. Not complaining about the video, but.... why youtube ?
Have you done an Italian butter cream recipe?
Why my icing not so thick
I got a crunchy taste of the sugar... What could b d reason?
Hi Jemma i live in the  caribbean and i normally do make sales outdoor and was wondering if the frosting will run?
Can u tell us the recipe in cups not grams
Ingredients - 150g (5oz) or (10 tablespoons) butter 340g (12oz) or (1 1/2 cups) icing sugar (also called powdered or confectioners sugar) 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla extract added to 3-4 tablespoons of milk
I need how to measure by cups.
Another easy and brilliant video. Thanks again for your easy recipe
How much buttercream icing will I need to fill and crumb coat an 8" cake?
I feel so sick after eating half of it with a spoon :x  But if anybody is curious, I used a vegan butter and it turned out fine.
nice plz also guide about making black buttercream
Would this buttercream be good to use with macaroons?
I think sugar only 300gram enough
Thank u 😊
Can you use lemon curd instead of milk?
After I make the buttercream can I pipe it directly? Or does it have to sit in the fridge or sth?
I had a question. I have seen in other butter cream videos they added cream instead of milk is that ok?
I think it's way too sweet even tho i even put lemon juice in it (could be because I'm european not american) so i would recommend half the amount of sugar. It also didn't get corporated well, don't know what i did wrong, i tried to follow the whole method thoroughly, the temperature was probably right too, but i could clearly feel the (powdered) sugar under my teeth when chewing. :s Could have been the quality of the sugar. Anyway it's nice for topping cupcakes or such but i wouldn't use it again for cake filling.
Can you whip it for too long? Will that be a problem?
thanks
How do I prevent the bettercream from melting especially when delivering the cupcakes to places which are 1.5 hours from my location?
What is the oreo cream made out of and can you replicate it?  Maybe ice a cake with?
Zheng talks with an accent and so fast it's annoying to listen to her. Sorry.
Horrible recipe. Tried it and it's horrible.
Is this Italian butter cream?
C trop sucré !!!
Can I put the left over in the refrigerator? And how to use it back again? Thank you.
Dear Jemma.... When will you try German buttercream for your delicious goods? It will be much more light and soft and you can leave off all these huge amounts of sugar 😁😁😁 you can easily try it as a vegan German "Buttercream" using plantbased milk and vegan spread as well - the results are amazing (and healthy 😁 why not getting best of both worlds? Yeaaahhh)    Have a nice and lovely day 🥰
Hello , what if I wanted to make half of the butter cream you made ? Do we half the measurements? Thanks
Loving this buttercream thank you so much for all the tips and tricks
JEMMAAAAAA!!! I’ve just started doing cupcakes with my son as a little hobby for him. How long does the piped icing stay soft for ? And is it normal for it to harden up once it’s on the cupcake ? Can I prolong it to make it stay softer longer ? Please help xx
Has anyone used this as chocolate butter cream or added chocolate?  Thanks in advance
Hi, would you believe it when I made this family said it's too sweet.  Jemma how can I de-sweeten it slightly?  Someone suggested adding cornflour ie 70% icing sugar and 30% cornflour.. would this work or have you any other ideas?
Thanx you
Hey Gemma, I did this today but somehow it was still a bit grainy. I added a bit more milk and beat it further but it only slightly improved. I added the sifted sugar in 2 batches. How can I improve the outcome?
Tfs! Love ur videos and ur so pretty.
Is that enough to ice a 2 layer 8 inch cake. Loved the video
I loved the recipe  But please can you also suggest how to color white chocolate. Actually I tried but it thickens and turned like a stone It would be very helpful if you reply.
I liked how u’re explaining how to make frosting but , u talk to fast , I’m American and Im having a hard time understand you . Slow down please. 😭😱
Always following your recipes and must say its spot on.. Cakes and frosting is amazing every time. For those who mentioned the buttercream is too sweet  instead of using 150g of unsalted butter use 100g unsalted butter and 50g of salted butter this will make the right balance if your not too keen in something really sweet i find this a better method especially in cakes because the cake itself has alot of sugar. Let me know how your turn out with this tip 👍🏼
Can you add lesser powdersuger because it's a little sweet for me.
I found this to be too sugary for my taste is there a trick to reducing the sugar by certain amounts and do you have to correspondingly reduce the other ingredients?
I always find buttercream too sweet 😥
Thank You Athea..Appreciate the Conversion!!! 😊🌺
Wished All would use amount, instead of Grams, we need to know CUPS... We DON'T understand GRAMS...THANK YOU...
Hello Jemma- I followed your recipe for buttercream but I still ended up with a lot of air pockets. I use handheld mixer. Will it help if I reduce the amount of beating time for the butter (from 5 min to 2-3 mins) and after adding sugar may be just until everything is incorporated.
Your machine is so quiet ❤
Thank you so much for this video! This recipe worked so well. I doubled all the quantities and managed to do buttercream icing for the base, in between layers and multi-coloured ombre as the final layer.
Stop the terrible music, it’s not needed !

this very help of me and how are starting to make cake.(love this)
Does this frosting work on Russian tips?
Please consider my request   Its better not to add the background music
Is the milk really necessary?  Or we can just skip it if the coloring is liquid already
I prefer to use Salted butter in buttercream because I find it cuts some of the sweetness out and I like to taste the butter.
What kind of mixer do you have?  It’s a kenwood right?  I just bought a mixer but the paddle doesn’t beat the bottom inch and a bit of the bowl so my butter isn’t getting picked up
Hi Jemma Any tips if instead of a stand mixer, we’re using a hand mixer or dare I say it, a spatula? I don’t have a stand mixer.
I know this video is about cooking .. but pls can I know what's the brand and type of your Mascara and eyeliner?
if you pause the video at 0:48 look at her face its soo funny
Why do I feel like she's a rude person irl?😂
🥰from india
@5:04 it is yellow buttercream, but at @5:07 it is white?  With nothing added?  Sorry, don't believe it. Your videos are normally good, but even with more than "a couple of minutes' beating" you cannot change colour that much.  @5:33 still white, @5:37 yellow again, @5:45 white again?  Weird.
Great video. How much butter cream would you normally use to ice a cake with 4 tier x 7.5 inch.
Choose for . . . . .  And not tri calcium phospate? I didnt get the best option, chef u talk to fast
In 3:10, what kind of powdered sugar is best used?
Chef Jemma, I didnt get your notes/tips to remember what to choose powdered sugar?
How many teaspoons if I use rose water maybe 1/2tsp?
Do you have an online shop where I can does gel colors? Too expensive here in Japan . Each color is 10dollars (980¥)
I made this last night but I live in Florida and it was already to the right consistency so I didn't add milk.  Is that ok?
I like the way you explain things.
Hi mam I need Ur's help can't u tell me the ingredients to make butter cream
Hi Jemma, can you freeze this buttercream?
Hi Jemma! I love your videos, and really appreciate your explanations! I have made your buttercream several times now! It is incredibly fluffy and smooth! I do have a question for you... mine seems to get a lot of large air holes that make it difficult to use for frosting a cake with a smooth finish. Any advice for eliminating the air holes in the buttercream? I have an electric stand mixer that I use. Thanks in advance!!!
How can i get contacted to you? I need to learn more
So if I make cake and I follow your buttercream recipe  it won’t drip of

Is the cocoa powder unsweetened?
Hi Jemma, regarding the icing sugar, my buttercream has been grainy and so I loved your suggestion for using an icing sugar with Maisie starch but since seeing your tutorial I have looked up about the Maisie starch and lots I have read says it's the Maisie starch in the icing sugar that makes the buttercream go grainy!!!! So I am totally confused, do you still stick by what you said in this tutorial and if so what make of icing sugar do you actually use at Crumbs and Dollies please? Thank you for all your help with soooooo many things. Kim xxxxx

Hi , I have a similar machine to what is shown in the video, but when I was tried to whip my butter it all just got stuck the bottom and didn’t really whip.

My frosting was curdled. What should I do?
We have your book now and made the vanilla cupcakes today. I noticed you add more sugar than the standard 1-2 ratio I have used before. Is the extra sugar to benefit taste or texture ?  Our cakes did turn out lovely and light and rose really well, thanks.

Thanks alot for d videos, it really helped me alot, am gonna show u my baking creations soon. Love u
Wat if u wanna work with salted butter?
But how would that work if you were doing Swiss Meringue Buttercream where you can’t beat the butter until it’s white.  I live in a country where the butter is very yellow so it’s hard to colour something a pale pink because when pink is added to a yellow it goes a coral colour.  It’s terribly frustrating as whipping butter generally works with making a buttercream, but not making a Swiss Meringue which I use all the time.
That is good and how you dI that is nice cak.
please don't use this awful music
Your this video is very nice
I love you and what you do!! you have made me a great baker!!
I hate the yellow thing butter gives,cause it messes the blue food color, making perfect blue frosting is hard, yellow & blue makes green or turquoise

Hi I noticed that there is what is called an icing mix product on supermarket shelves.  This has tapioca in with the icing sugar. It looks like it is softer and doesn't lump in the bag like pure icing sugar does. What do you think of this so called Icing sugar mix?  😂😂
Does it really matter if you use a whisk attachment or paddle attachment? Will it change the consistency?
Is it pure icing sugar?  Or icing sugar that contains maize starch
What's the to note about icing sugar? Find ones made with corn starch?

Hi Jemma, I followed the instructions to the letter in terms of butter consistency and whipping timings, and only used 3tbsp of the milk mixture. The buttercream was indeed really white and fluffy and silky however, it came out a bit too soft I think. It is a bit of a warm night tonight in the UK. Should I have done something differently? And is there a way to remedy it if it gets too soft?
😓🤔

Excellent video! I'm sure I would have messed up if I'd attempted this, because after watching your video I realize there's a lot more to making buttercream than I'd initially thought 😂 Thankyou for this extremely helpful video.  One question though: I keep the buttercream covered while using it ? Or when I'm not stirring it? Like...If I'm going for a short to get something I should keep it covered? I'm slightly confused at this point.
amazing
I followed instructions but the buttercream is unbelievably sweet, should it taste like extremely sweet? structure and thickness was absolutely fine.
I tried this and it all looked ok. However when I started to decorate the swirls started to slide down the cake. I can't understand why? as the cake had been in the freezer for an hour and the butter cream also?
Hey jemma, can u pls do a tutorial on turquoise buttercream....

Hello, creme after fridge or without fridge it's soft? I tasted one time and it was little like hard
I made the buttercream icing today but it turned out a little bit runny. Is it because of mixing butter for a long time? and will adding 340g of icing sugar make the buttercream icing to become too sweet?  because I just added just half of the icing sugar but it was already too sweet for me. 😇
I love your videos. They answer so many questions.

Given that butter is dyed, could you not just use unsalted undyed butter to get a nice white icing?
LOVED this video! I so wish I had watched it before making my butter cream icing today!!! Thank you for all the tips!💖💕🌸
Hey Gemma everytime I make buttercream it's super fluffy when first made but the next day or even a few hours later it really hardens up without me putting it in the fridge. So it loses that fluffy light buttercream taste and turns into a slab of buttery sugar. What am I doing wrong?
I love it ;) yummy
Hi...can I replace shortening with the butter?
Is color paste the same as color gel?
I really have had trouble finding a buttercream recipe I like. They are either too sweet or I feel like I'm eating butter. This recipe is the perfect balance of light, sweet, and airy. I'll be using it again! Thank you for sharing such detailed instructions!
i made it, wayyyy too sweet for me. I had to add sour cream and cream cheese to cut down on the sugar assault.
Thank you for all of the knowledge you share. I’m very grateful 🙏🏼
🎉🤘🏼💋👩‍🦳👨🏻‍🎓🧖‍♂️👩‍❤️‍👩👩‍❤️‍💋‍👩💏🎩👖👔🕶

How much you told 😝
I'm in hot country. This helped me soooo much.
This is great! I'm going to use it for mothers day!😄😉
verry good thankyou
can you use salted butter?
So, I have a question. Do you need to have so INCREADIBLY much sugar in it? Can you skip the milk and therefore use less sugar? I've made my own recipes with sour cream and butter and lemon juice and very little icing sugar. It works if you mix very little. But is it possible to do a fluffy buttercream with less sugar? Normal ones don't even taste good that sweet...
can we  use Handmixer.
How i keepit if I do today the buttercream today and I need to use tomorrow !?in the fridge ,o room temperature!?

Could you explain how and or where to find the fat content on the butter package. I’m in Texas and if I’m looking at the correct thing on the package of butter I can only find 12-18% butter fat   I’d love to know for sure how to find the right info  for use in my home based bakery. Love all your stuff thanks.
بارك الله فيك
This is the best American-style buttercream I've ever made. SO LIGHT! Thank you!
🍨🍧
Excellent
I've only ever heard icing sugar with maize starch makes the buttercream gritty, chalky and less smooth... so very contradictory to what Jemma has said here ???
Luved the demo so pro U Go Girl
Can you make buttercream without a mixer? Just with a whisk?
How do you flavor your buttercream
Hello, can I ask, for how big cake is this amount used for? If I want to make this type of buttercream for 4 layered cake (one of your videos-the best Madeira cake recipe) how much of each ingredient should I add into? Thank you for your respond :)
Can’t wait to try your recipe for my French macarons 🙏🙏😊😊
I don't use any milk in my buttercream because I like a bit of texture.
I use salted butter in buttercream because I find it evens the taste and gives a more butter.
Omg!!!! This is absolutely the best buttercream ever!!!!
Thank you for your video! I just have two questions:  1- if I prepare the cupcakes or cake the day before, should I apply the frosting  on that day or wait until I will serve them? 2- if I don't have a mixer, will I have the same result by mixing with a spoon?
okay-- have the answer lol
I want to put vanilla paste in it!  Will that ruin the icing?
To make lime flavoured butter cream can you substitute lime juice for the milk or use the rind??
How come this recipe doesn't use vanilla extract?
I'm just a newbie and don't have proper education in baking... Watching u making demos with various tips and hints inspires and educates  me.
My problem is I live in Hawaii everyone loves my buttercream but after taking out of the fridge in the heat my frosting starts melting.any idea what I can do to fix this problem I don’t wanna add more sugar cause it tends to be a little sweeter than most people like and I think it taste like some thing you buy buy at Walmart or local store where all you get is sugar and not flavor
can i use evaporated milk??
Love it
what happens if you put the icing in a vacuum chamber?
I must have done something wrong...it was grainy even though i did sieve and add the icing sugar in 4 stages. It took me an hour and it was way too sweet. I really dont know what i could have done differently. I actually followed every little bit of this recipe (x3).
Jemma, is this a crusting buttercream?
Jemma, can this buttercream recipe be used with the Russian tips? I love your videos.
can I use a whisk attachment instead of a paddle attachment? would it take less time if whisk used?
Will appreciate if u could give d measurements in cups (US measurements) most of us don’t have scale machine. Thnks
Hi  there what butter did you use  Can you please give the name and where you got it from  I am from the uk  Many thanks
Storage???
I actually enjoy a little salty buttercream...now I'm thinking of half unsalted and half salted butter to try and get the perfect lightly salty taste.
This seems too soft! I wish you would have piped a cupcake so we could see how it came out as it would get warm from your hand on the piping bag too. This just doesn't seem right to me.
I'm a buttercream novice, this is by far the best video I've seen with clear, simple instructions. My buttercream was by far the best I ever made using this recipe, however still not perfect I think. It seems ideal with half the sugar in, once I added remaining sugar and liquid while consistency seemed OK and piped well, after few minutes when I tasted it was a tiny bit grainy. And soooo sweet! It was mixed for ages because I kept adding food colouring bit by bit (gel). Any tips? Should I have used less sugar? I'm using electronic scales so I'm pretty sure measurments are correct x
can I use salted butter instead?
Thank you for sharing this instructional video!! Can this recipe be used for piping flowers onto cupcakes?
This butter cream  frosting how long we can keep without refrigerator

Can we use salted butter?
You are the best!

Buttercream is the most disgusting sweet ingredient ever. It is impossible for me to understand how you brits are willing to eat sweets with buttercream voluntarily. It is like eating sweet lard. There are always so many better alternatives.

Hey, how would I make a gingerbread flavored buttercream?
Hi Jemma thanks for this video, quick question please, what’s the name of your mixer.
I'm gonna try this. I'm so upset with buttercream rn because everytime I make it like this "american buttercream" with just the butter and powdered sugar and flavoring it comes out so grainy and sugary and horrible. I tried making swiss meringue buttercream because I heard some like it more but it just tasted like straight butter. Now I feel like I have a better understanding of what I might've been doing wrong so I hope it turns out well

I tried to make this lemon buttercream with 2tbsp milk and 1 tbsp lemon juice. It's a little on the runny side... do I just add more icing sugar gently?
I’m so happy I discovered your channel!
340g converts to only 1 cup of sugar and it looks like you’re using more????
Is it enough for a cake??
Thanks Jemma for the tips! I love your videos!
Yeah the everyday, average person " CAN " afford to buy french butter @ $$ 8.99 / 8.8 ozs. Thanks SOOOOOOOOOOO much !

Hi I am crazy over all your recipe, this this butter cream recipe good for making flowers that will last long enough if I put them in the fridge.
Hi, thanx for ur great, helpful video n demo; just a quick question (I’m a novice, new to buttercream, fyi), at the end of your video you state the final product (buttercream) can be stored in an airtight container at room temp. Does that mean this is the way to store it, ie this doesn’t get refrigerated? I just want to clarify storage requirements so as to waste as least as possible. Thanx for your time n videos as well as your advice! 😉🤙🏻♥️🍰🌺

Hello cupcake Jemma, first of all thank you very much for all your Videos , which is my #1  Cupcake Jemma in my list  where I can buy the color paste I’m from the far east  and I’m a beginner and I want to start doing it on the right track by watching all you videos.I find it very interesting to follow than the others.Again thank you for your superb Recipes.
Do you refrigerate it or leave it out
Your video is very informative and educating. However,  I have a question. If one doesn't get butter, can one use margarine as a substitute? And are there any peculiarities relating to such a choice?
Jesus. I need the measurements In US conversions
How many hours can we keep the butter cream out if planning to use it in the same day ? Will there be change in consistency if we keep it out too long ?

In the video around 3:06, She said to look for an ingredient in Icing Sugar instead of calcium phosphate (I think) did understand her over the accent (Loved it tho ❤)... Please clarify the ingredients and what brand of Icing Sugar is used?
If I use less sugar will the consistency be as good as in the video?
Perfect eyeliner tutorial next please!
That is sooo much sugar :O I tried it but it was too sweet for me :'(
This is basically American Buttercream. No thanks, I find it too sweet. I'll stick to my Swiss meringue buttercream.
I always end up with liquidy buttercream. My butter was the same texture but why?? I live in Malaysia is it bcs of the weather??
Thanks. Very useful and clear video,thanks to you  finally i know how to do butter cream right and no more mistakes.
My buttercream doesn’t look smooth at all...I think the butter is melted at good condition( spreadable but keep in the shape) I used the hand-held mixer to mix the butter for about 6mints and added all the sugar, then beat for about 5mints (sugar has been sieved) ...the butter is not either pale or smooth.....
very helpful😍😉
How do you get rid of the gritty texture of the powdered sugar? Can you use warm milk?

So helpfu, thank you! Just a quick question, do I need to refrigerate cupcakes with buttercream frosting?
Hi I'm 13and I've started baking I can make cupcakes, cookies and sponges quite well but buttercream is difficult usually when I make it it's very heavy and thick it also makes cupcakes deflate.i presume you are very busy and don't have time to answer but if you do can you please give me a few tips? Great video by the way
Can i use fresh milk?
Thank for considering us from the tropical countries.
Thanks Jemma!  This was super easy to follow and I just made the most AMAZING buttercream icing of my life!
lol here in the Netherlands it's almost impossible to get a good vanilla extract and colour paste/gel... *cries in Dutch*
If I want to make a 3 layer stacked cake with buttercream filling and icing, how many batches of this recipe do I need to use?
I'm from algeria and i like every videos of yours i hope to be like you a good Baker one day sorry for my bad English
Hi jemma I love your videos they are seriously the best and you are pretty darn talented My butter cream starts to melt within just five or ten minutes of decorating  Do you have any tips on how I can fix that
It came out too sweet....any way to fix that?
I loooove your accent
as someone who lives in the USA, I've converted her recipes to the US measurements and I've never had an issue with any of her recipes. Love them! The thing is I know my oven does not heat evenly, nor does it heat to the right temperature so I've always had that in mind when baking so be aware of that. Measurements are very important but so is heating things evenly and properly. Pertaining to this buttercream recipe, it is wonderful. It's very fluffy for buttercream, which I'm not too fond of because it tends to be far too sweet and most of the time it can get grainy on store-bought treats but this is perfect.
I just made this and it's the best recipe I've found so far.  Smooth and creamy and not very grainy.  Yum!
Hard to watch with that royalty free music. It makes me want to hang my self
Thanks Jemma, I am so going to try this for my cupcakes.
Is this the best buttercream to use with the Russian piping tips?
My buttercream has always been bad so I decided to use Jemma's recipe and I have to say, it's.the best buttercream I've ever made! Thanks Jemma. 😊
She talked too fast.
Thank you,thank you, thank you! I made this recipe, following your instructions and my buttercream turned out AMAZING!
Thank you so much Jemma! I never got them right until now!
Thank you soooooooo much for making this video!! I've been searching for the perfect (while still being easy to do) buttercream recipe and I tried this last night, it's AMAZING! Best buttercream I've ever made hands down. Thank you thank you thank you!!!!!
Very good tutorial! Thanks!
Jemma.why i make buttercream not to smooth.i shifted cinfectioner sugar but still grift
What brand of food colouring do u use?
Thanks a lot.
Hi. Y butter cream is melting what is the reason please reply?
Best ever and very soft nice job
This looks good, I look forward to making it. :)
I was having trouble with buttercream before this video! I would always go step by step as recipes said, but it would always be gritty. After using the tips (mainly beating it in btw each addition of sugar and the 5 minutes at the beginning really helped). It was very white in color. Easy to color with gel colors. Thank you for the tips!
I LOVE that little silicone? spatula you used to color the buttercream! I have to find one 😁
To soften my butter quickly I pour boiling water into a cup or bowl and let it sit for a minute, then I pour the water out and place the container over my butter, let it sit for a couple of minutes and your butter becomes room temperature.
So nice to hear that no-nonsense English accent
How can I determine the sweetness of the buttercream after adding sugar in the mixer? Can I continue adding icing sugar if desired sweetness is not achieved and whipp it in the mixer..kindly assist its my first attempt
if your making chocolate buttercream, at which point should we add the chocolate and to what ratio(for dark and milk)? also should it be room temp or cool? . Please help me out. Thank you
jemma talks too much and repeats the same thing
Please help me...if i use a hand mixer normal electric one...how much of time i need to mix those ingredients .....🤔🤔
Hi gemma! I followed your recipe and while beating the butter , instead of turning fluffy it turned liquidy and runny . I donno what to do . Please tell me someone .
Nice
Can I please ask where is good to buy butter in a larger /cheaper way than at the supermarket? I'm new to trying cupcake making and baking with butter. I can really taste the difference to the margarine I've always used before! However it doesn't go very far... I block each time I bake. Any advice please??
i love the way u explained every step
Hi, the place I m staying is hot throughout the year.  How Do I keep the shape of the frosting on cupcakes ? Will it melt if leave on the party table?
Hi Jemma ! how you explain it is amazing !! very clear and happy to listen how you talk ! awesome
I live in the philipines which is a bit hot. How many liquid should i add to the butter cream?
Thank u so much!!🙌🙌
The sugar u used is too much.it just spoiled my cake...very upset with that
Hi, great Vidio!!! Just wondering,  could u do this with a hand electric mixer???? 😁❤
Subtítulos en español por favor me encantaría seguir tu canal
Who cares I’m gonna use Nutella
Awesome video thanks!
Does the milk have to be room temperature?
I imagine there is an optimum temperature for the butter.Perhaps a digital thermometer would help?
Good one!  Thankyou!
love love love your recipes and all your tips... I have a question, does this buttercream work for decorating naked cake? thank you very much
I love your video very much...will u please remove your noise ring...it doesn't look nice...i know its not my bussiness...😊 please don mind😊
I put a bit too much milk in and now I can get it to be more firm. If it stands for a couple of seconds it flattens out. I tried putting more sugar in and it help a bit but no enough. What to do?
Today I made this for the first time. It was brilliant to decorate with and tastes amazing. Someone else brought bakery cupcakes and they couldnt even compare. This recipe is the bomb.
how do I get a dusty blue in my buttercream..not teal
How do I make a very dark purple butter icing ?
Great! Thank you so much :)
I have tried so many ways of doing buttercream frosting and OMG!! Thank you for sharing. It is delicious and not so sweet as others. It was difficult trying to get the right amount of butter needed since I live in the U.S. and I am not great in math lol. Overall, I love you and your channel!
Who came here from gemma's video😅
I knew it was hopeless when you had a stand mixer and gourmet butter 😳😂 looks delicious tho!
Hey Jemma! Can I use hand beater?
Song?
Wow superb me i,m gonna try this buttercream tomorrow morning i rly like it it’s very detailed nd perfect
No vanilla? I've never heard of anyone making buttercream without any extra flavoring. I'm wondering if this is also an "american" thing. Still looks delicious, I'm definitely going to keep an eye out for what KIND of confectioners sugar I get. I didn't know they differ in ingredients (tricalcium phosphate vs the better one..)
I'm curious to see if our butter is labeled the same in the US. I've never noticed a fat percentage, on our Challenge butter I don't see any indication besides the grams of fat nutritionally. I guess you'd just compare that. I'm silly.
What did you say in minute 3.05-3.14 Jemma? Too fast. Anybody knows?
That is cool...
best instruction ever thanks!!!
Ingredients: 150g (5oz) unsalted butter 340g (12oz) icing sugar (also called powdered or confectioners' sugar) Around 3 tablespoons of milk
Very helpful thank you!
Wanna dip my whole face into this bowl 😛😋😛😋
I live in Panama and had that exact problem where my butter was too soft and it turned my gorgeous Italian meringue into buttercream soup :(
Can we make roses out of these buttercream???  Can we use cream of tartar for rose stiffness??
What’s the name of the blue  and other liquids you used for icings can u please tell me
Hey Jemma - I followed the recipe but the icing didn’t increase in volume. Was I suppose to beat or whip it ( I only have a hand mixer)?
Is this enough for 12 cupcakes?
How many cupcakes would this cover
you are talking too much
u are gourges
You are amazing. Simple instructions , beautiful results 😘😘🇬🇧🙋‍♀️
My home ec teacher said that a few years ago she learned in collage that you actually don’t have to sieve icing sugar xx
please make videos without the music :/
You should make ginger bread people because I tired to make some but I failed to it was hard so please make some ginger bread people.
I made the frosting but it was not smooth...it was more on a grainy texture side...why so?
Can I use liquid colouring if I don't have colouring paste ?

Can we use a whisk to make buttercream?
I’m diving right in and making my 2 year old daughter a unicorn cake for her birthday this month. I don’t have a lot of money to spend on the gel colors though. I have to use the liquid sadly, do you have any advise to help me not ruin the buttercream? I’d use gel if affordable but where I am and on such a short time frame it’s about 10 dollars for 1 color and I just can’t afford that. Thanks so much, love your videos!!!
This recipe did not work for me it ended up very liquidy and I followed all the instructions
You mentioned the type of icing sugar to use to avoid crystals as I call it. I use Domino's icing sugar to make my buttercream icing. Will that work?
I love this woman, amazing.
My son wants a tractor cake. The cake must be chocolate but then I need white, green, black and yellow icing. How can I achieve this????? please send help!!

Tried the recipe but on fortunately it was way to sweet and buttery for me
Dear Jemma, your way of making buttercream is great! How can I make extra and keep for future use? I plan to put it on bread for my kids' breakfast daily, but won;t have time to do fresh cream everyday.
thank you
nice work
Hi how much buttercream should I make for a number 1 cake with 1 layer or maybe two layers
Jemma your eyeliner is on point!!
Please can you be more specific about amount of butter to be taken and how much sugar for that amount of butter... Sorry, m really poor in this measurement thing.
I make buttercream this exact same way, yet when the guests arrive and I take the cupcakes out of the fridge, they are melted/deflated, whatever the correct word is... :/ It's so liquid'y, and if I put too much powdered sugar or whatever else in it, to stiffen it, you can feel the sugar crunching between your teeth... :'/
Hello ma'am ... i am from india. I just saw your buttercream recipe..nd i loved it.. i have to make a cake tommorrow.. so i want to ask you that ..can i prepare the buttercream frosting today and store it in refrigerator in air tight container??? Or it will be hard...can you please guide me..
OMG!! Tried to make the frosting but it did not come out right. It turned pale but it didn’t become fluffy and it started to melt as I was spreading it on my cakes.... Did I miss a step?! Help needed....
A very helpful video. I've always ended up with a slightly grainy texture to my bitterness.

Nice Icing
Hello Jemma! I made this buttercream frosting to my rosette cake and it is very delicious. It’s easy to make and not too sweet! Thank you for this.
I have a question! She said to leave the butter out overnight for the smooth texture, but when I looked up whether it was safe to do so, most websites said you shouldn't leave it out overnight. Some said you can but at a certain room temp.  What's the best option? :)
Can you put in cup
My buttercream always has that butter taste, even when adding flavor. How can I get rid of that?
Hi Jemma i am going to be icing a 2 tier cake bottom is 8inch and top is 4 inch)  using buttercream to crumb coat and decorate using a swirl technique how much buttercream would i need for this , thanks .

#cupcakejemma

Hi!! I've been trying to do a Dulce de Leche buttercream, do you have any suggestions of what quantity to add to your buttercream recipe? thanks!!
should i add cocoa powder before or after icing sugar?
I done this for my wife's birthday cake (pouring Maltesers cake) and it turned out fantastic,  1st attempt at doing it too, thanks @cupcakejemma
We use 2 cups of Crisco brand  crisco and 2 boxes of confectionery sugar then add CLEAR vanilla extract, CLEAR butter flavoring and sometimes just a tiny bit of clear lemon flavoring. This makes a great tasting icing and so easy to use icing (oh and a little of milk or water to get the right consistency). U can buy the clear flavors at Walmart or anywhere I would think that sales cake supplies. It makes everything really white (of course u can add coloring)  I know it sounds weird to use Crisco but try it sometimes. U can always half it and see how u like it. Just our family recipe, but we get begged to make cakes all the time lol oh I am in the USA, Alabama....
Trying to figure out how much this recipe makes.
Hi, just wanting to check - is this the same recipe you use when frosting cakes? In your smooth buttercream tutorial you talk about getting a smooth buttercream and getting the bubbles out - how do you achieve that? Thanks!

Is there a recept for a nice buttercream without so much icing sugar??
Your buttercream recipe saved the day! I tried other recipes without having a clue how long to beat butter etc and each time it came out awful. Finally went to YouTube and you are my buttercream angel! Night and day consistency and flavor. Only one question... I used regular vanilla extract and it didn’t give much vanilla flavor. I noticed you used a thicker more concentrated vanilla extract. Can you tell me which one you recommend? I watched your vanilla bean video but wasn’t able to determine which you may have used. Thanks so much!
love her accent!
She talks waaay too fast at times ... Its hard to understand her.  Expecially when talking about the powdered sugar
No link to the crazy vanilla extracts?
Can I use a hand mixer to make a butter cream or whipped cream icing? Or does it have to be a professional mixer like yours in the video?! :)

I sifted the sugar once for lumps and as I added it to the bowl while I was whipping the butter (I had a hand mixed so it was easier. Her stand mixer doesn’t let you do that.)
By the time I’m mixing in the sugar it getting really running like condensed milk texture can someone please help
Can i pipe this icing onto cupcakes the day before consumption??  Or will they end up with crispy nugget edges???
I’m considering icing a cake for a party with frosting/buttercream roses but don’t want them to melt or droop over the course of the party, especially if it is a hot day - is it a good idea to put your icing in the fridge for a few minutes before piping so that they keep their shape for longer? Or is there another way to do this?  Thanks!
I dont like buttercream much because its very rich, how do I male it less rich?
Can we use salted butter instead of unsalted?
Very well explained!
My buttercream came out runny like cake mix even before I added the milk..?
Yum
Perfect thank you
this is a serious question but pls comment on this cupcake jemma but ca you use powdered sugar insted of icing sugar
Hi!! Do you have the recipe to make buttercream whitn creamchees! (Sorry for my english)
Really instructive  and helpful - thanks. I combine unrefined coconut flower sugar with regular  icing sugar and the result is a caramel flavor -  simply marvelous served with strong black coffee. It's a guy thing. It doesn't come out grainy as I thought it might - and instead of milk I add plain yoghurt.  Oh - and shred me if you will - but I use olive oil spread instead of butter.
Aww you’re so sweet. I loved this video and I’m so glad I found it. I’m actually going to get the ingredients and try this today!! I’m also going to follow you! Thank you for this great video!

Wonderful😊 thanks for the video 😉
My buttercream is always soft so my piping goes wrong.  Hope this helps :)
Jemma, as long as you will not transform your sugar into syrup, your buttercream will still be sandy. Indeed, sugar DO NOT dissolve into butter.
This is my go to buttercream recipe it is always spot on everytime I've made it. I get loads of compliments. Thanks for that Jemma, your a star!💯
Been using this recipe for two years now, perfect every time!

I've been using an electric hand whisk, and room temp butter. But it always goes a bit curdled / separated and too soft to pipe. What am I doing wrong? Do I need firmer butter?

that incessant whistling is really distracting
Can I refrigerate buttercream?
Great! I died until I found this recipe!!!  That’s why the whipped cream people use in their cakes looked so different from the ones I made at home all the time.  Now I know why! I used only the cream and sugar and nothing more because my friend first taught me like that.
making this tonight and adding cola instead off milk
Is it a little TOO sweet with the whole amount of sugar??
I made a few times buttercream and it came out grainy and i dont know why. I make my powdered sugar myself. For 1 cup sugar u put 1tbs of corn starch. I make the same as you do it doesnt work. Could you or someone help me out

Hi . Thank you for this video. You speak very fast and i can not recognize your words😣😣😣😣
I thought butter cream was meant to be a 1:4 fat to sugar ratio…. Yours isn't. What is correct? :O
I used this buttercream recipe today and it's the first time my buttercream has ever tasted so good. 😋
What is the best brand of colouring gels to use?
How to add a cream cheese filling to a cake?
The recipe is ok for a cake 24 cm?

Hello Jemma! I 'm one of your big fans and I have a question to make! Why my buttercreame  starts to dries after 3-4 hours of piping my cupcakes? Sorry for grammar mistakes I 'm new in UK!
Hi Jemma, Do you pipe the middle of the macarons just with this buttercream? Do you have any other suggestions for middle layer of French macarons?
Hi Jemma I've made " your' buttercream and it worked out great BUT it does sort of dries up on a cake or cupcake. Is that supposed to happen or should I look for a better icing sugar? And do you use this buttercream to coat your cakes ?
Could this buttercream can. Leave outside when the cake is. Done
Wish you could stay around in my kitchen :) greeat teacher!!!
My buttercream always freezes so what shall I do ?
Can you substitute for butter for vanilla shortening? If so are the amounts the same
I love your buttercream recipe! It’s my favorite! Two Questions please: Do you every combine Vegetable shortening, such as Crisco, to your buttercream so it doesn’t melt as easily when piping? Do you have a video on icing consistencies for each ‘job’?
Subscribed!! Thank you for sharing your tips with us! As much as we love desserts I don’t like to buy them because of all the chemicals. I appreciate your style of explaining and all of the side information you gave as well! Thank you for the visual aids!!! You showed Everything you talked about!!! feel like I can do this and actually succeed. I appreciate this video very much!
I tried to make butter cream today.... but it's endup like a liquid not creamy as shown on your show....what's wring with mine??

She keeps saying “if its warm in your country”, but i live in the US where we have like a dozen different climates
Hi Jemma ！I would like to ask can i use electric hand mixer cause i dont have a stand mixer
How much buttercream.do I need to ice a 4 layer ombre cake?
What happens if you use Salted butter?  I find it tastes nice and buttery.
I use Salted butter in buttercream to get that Buttery taste.
I don’t understand why mine got back to butter :’(
Can I do it without electrical
can anyone help me covert the c measurements to non metric lol
Thank you!
wow  I  can't  do  that.
What’s the reason when the buttercream has lumps in it and is a liquid?
how much does this amount that you made cover and fill a cake? just one large cake?
Thx for posting this video. I always make buttercream but I always under granulated sugar. However, I'm going to switch to the confectioners you did on my next one. Thing is, you mentioned it can be stored at room temperature. I live in a hot state so while I was trying to decorate, al was fine & dandy at first but at some point, my icing began to melt. When this occurs, what would you recommend to preserve the cake & icing before & after decorating?
@CupcakeJemma I'm making a four-layer cake with multiple colours of buttercream - what should I multiply your recipe by?
This was a great video. Glad I stumbled upon it
I tried this and it was overwhealmingly sweet. Ew
But how much butter we nid
This is such a good buttercream recipe! So tasty and very detailed so you can get it perfect! I recommend this recipe!
How many grams in a cup?
Omg! Is she the girl from CBeebies?
Jemma I’m so glad I found your site. I watched your piping tips and now I’m about to try it. Hopefully if I get better I’ll be able to make my soap cupcakes.
Thank you so much!! That was so helpful 💞
This is wonderful, but please don't encourage single use plastic!  It really isn't that much trouble to wash out the piping bag.  Please don't add to our throw away society!  I do appreciate the piping tips tho.  :)
Finally someone who solved my problem with not getting almost white butter cream :)
The icing sugar confused me my icing sugar has cane sugar and corn starch should I find another brand
You we can store are butter cream in a container at room temperature   no  refrigerator
Amazing stuff
This is very sweet.
I used liquid food coloring in icing but u used gel which one is better
Won't it be too sweet if u add 340 gm sugar for 150 gm butter??
HOW MUCH MILK DOSE SHE USE, QUICK IM MAKING THE RECIPE BUT I NEEDTO KNOW HOW MUCH MILK TO PUT IN!!!
Is it possible to overbeat the mix and make the emulsion of the butter break?
I tried the recipe and the  80% fat content in the butter really made the different. It tasted really delicious
Btw guys I tried this, big mistake at is just all butter and sugar, and the sugar does not make you have anymore it’s all the butter!
Thanks for the help it was useful
Just made this exactly how you said and it went fine after I added the milk but they were much more sweet than yours 😳😳 do you have any idea why?
after many years of making buttercream, I have found Jemma's  recipe and tutorial very interersting. Just made the palest and best ever butter cream. Thanks
LOVE the consistency! Your instructions made my buttercream perfect but it's way too sweet for me and I only used 275g of sugar 😬 I'm going to keep experimenting with it though because I trust your recipes!
I love the way you talk 😊
🙄 sooooo 350 grams = how many cups am I spose to wheigh out my sugar in grams well I ain’t got no scale so guess I won’t b  following ure recipe 🤨
Oh my goodness. Normally, I really dislike American buttercream, but I decided to make this to practice piping.... Oh heavenly goodness, I could have eaten this entire batch with a spoon - so delicious!!
Merci pour la vidéos
Spatulurrrr
Why powdered sugar do not mixed very well and the i can feel sugar in  the finish stage

Hi Jemma!  whether your buttercream can be made like a flower? Like korean flower buttercream..
He
That is great
Big fan of using buttercream in my cakes, not a ganache person at all x
Better frosting recipe I've ever found!   Can you plz show how to make flowers?
Is this frosting really sweet?
Yay a girl who has there name with a J For Jemma not a G My name is Jemma great vid by the way 👍
I like how you always addressed viewers from 'hot/tropical countries' because room temp definitely affect baking/confectionary making and many doesn't realize why results differ from straight away copying recipes from the internet. I am one of this demography and appreciate advices from pros like you. Thank you it's really helpful!
Thanks for the helpful hints about buttercream
Hi Jemma could you please advise where you buy your food coloring from and brand do you use if any? Thanks
Is there a difference between icing sugar and powdered sugar? also I only have a small handheld electric mixer, would that work just fine or is there something I need to consider when using it?
Can you make a video of how to make the buttercream swirl with different color type of icing
I used to try all kinds of buttercream recipes. Buttercream for me is essential for cakes and cupcakes and finding the right recipe was so important. None of them worked and I lost all hope! Till I came across Jemma's YouTube! I never usually comment on videos but had to say thank you for your videos!!! :D
You're adorable!! Thank you for this. Subscribing!
Thanks for this great informative video. You are a great teacher with lots of attention to details.
Can you use food colouring for colouring the buttercream?
I️ use Domino powdered sugar and it uses cornstarch? Is that the same thing?
What is the difference between buttercream frosting and cream cheese frosting? I mean, when is the best situation to use one or another?
I used your recipe for a Mother's Day cake topping and it turned out great
I'd like to frost her cupcakes
What if your making a cake?
(I'm in the US) I went to a specialty European market for reasons totally unrelated to baking and I found that same brand of French butter! Finally, I can make similar buttercream to yours :) Wish I could have found it earlier lol  I followed this recipe for buttercream for a cake I made last month, but my buttercream came out with a bunch of air-pockets. After watching the video again now, Jemma says "regardless of how much icing I'm making, I always add [the sugar] in 2 stages". I added the sugar in 3-4 stages and whipped 3 minutes in between each stage. Basically I added too much air which caused those air-pockets. Lesson learned! Hope this helps somebody else.

Hi jemma, ive been watching you and your recipes and i love them but several of your recipes are hard for me to remake or bake my cupcakes using your recipe because i don’t have any scale at home.

Hi, I wanted to know if you ever add cream cheese to buttercream? Some recipes call for it and some don't.....I'm confused as to which to make for my carrot cake?!

Thank you Jemma!  That answers most questions I've had about how to make a good buttercream frosting.  I do use the same ingredients as you, but maybe my butter doesn't have enough fat content.  I don't think I've been beating it long enough either.  I'm looking forward to making my next cake/cupcakes now!  Thanks for sharing.   :)
Hi Jemma , I really don't get this me and my ad are making a cake and the buttercream is just like think water with butter in it how did u manage to do it xx
I made this recipe to use with Russian piping tips because it's supposed to be good for piping.  Well, maybe it's OK for regular piping, but not for the piping tips.  It is too soft, and no matter how much additional confectioners sugar I added, it didn't get stiff enough.  I had to throw it all out, along with 24 cupcakes.  I have yet to find a good buttercream recipe for Russian piping tips.  Can anyone direct me to one?
oh dude why you incredible fast talkin
How much would I need to times it by for a cake ??
Beautiful deconration
I live in India, and the room temperature is around 22-24°C so do you recommend keep the butter cream in the fridge? As I need to make it an evening before service the next day?  Love your videos. Thanks a ton!

It's a no fail recipe. I'm from India where buttercream frosting is not liked much but I tried this for a cake I made 2 days back, it was absolutely perfect. It was very soft, not at all grainy and everyone loved it. Thank you Jemma😘
Great presentation! Love the tips... Now to try it out!
Hi, I've watched a couple of your videos now and they're great! Thanks for sharing! I did have a few questions though, you said to store at room temperature, I had always thought to store in the fridge, is it better to store on the counter? After a cake is iced should it go into the fridge or stay on the counter? (If I'm making a cake the day before a party?) Also I find that when I pipe my cakes my buttercream starts melting since my hands are warm, is there a secret trick?
Thank you very much, Jemma to shear your knowledge with us. xxx

What's the measurements of half the recipe????
I need a stand mixer...
I can't have milk or milk products, what can I use to replace the butter and milk?
What type of powdered sugar? You were talking a little fast.
hi jemma i just wanna ask why does my buttercream is not smooth . i can really taste the grainny texture even i used powdered sugar . what did i just do wrong .
Is butter cheap in the UK? in Canada a pound of butter is around $5 for the cheapest one and goes to about $12 for a pound for higher quality.
Some hints for those struggling with the metric measurements.  Grams is a measurement of weight. Cups is a measurement of volume. So if you do a direct conversion, you'll wind up with too much sugar, because sugar weighs more!   There are electronic food scales that are super cheap and handy that can work with ounces as well as grams. I have an OXO Good Grips stainless steel food scale and it can measure grams. Handy if you're looking at international recipes.  Now, I've been struggling with cupcakes that sunk in the middle as well as perhaps felt a bit too oily. The things I'll try is not use an unsalted butter with such a high butterfat content. I tend to use french butter with high milkfat content and I think that's contributing to some of it (but man, it tastes so good).  Unsalted butter in London, she's going to find butter that's a minimum of 80% milkfat  Another thing to point out for those dealing with sunken cupcakes.  An metric teaspoon is not the same as a US teaspoon. Egadzooks!  1 Imperial/British teaspoon is equal to just about 1.2 us teaspoon.  Which means if you put in 1 teaspoon of baking soda, you didn't put in enough. And we all know baking is really about exact measurements when it comes to getting your goods to rise.  So 1/4 teaspoon that Jemma says may very well be too little, if you're using a US teaspoon.  So how the heck do you measure .30 of a us teaspoon aka, 3/10th?  I'm going to "mound" my teaspoon with extra baking soda and see if that helps as well.  First things first, I'm going to go try a slightly more amount of baking soda to try and reach that imperial teaspoon and see if that helps.
Y con esta buttercream ! Rellenas los pasteles ???? !!!!! Podran decirme ????
I learned so much from this! Mostly that I've been doing it all wrong. My butter has been too soft, I don't whip it long enough, and I haven't sifted the sugar. I'm really excited to see how much better my buttercream will be now. Thank you!
How do you prevent buttercream from having air looking bubbles, looking like holes in the texture?
OMG it's amazing :)
can it be kept in the fridge after icing
Hey! Just used this to make a Mexican hot punch (ponche) buttercream!  instead of milk I used the thick custard I made from it and added about 2-3 extra tablespoons for an intense flavor. It got harder instead of turning soft because my custard was in the refrigerator and I added some gelatin to it in case I wanted to put some in top.  It's a perfect recipe for flavor experiments!
I had trouble in making buttercream frosting. I dont know why my buttercream cannot be thick. I use mixer for 3 hours but not turn well
Is it possible to simply swap out the milk for ANY other liquid? For example. if I wanted to make a boozy frosting, then I could swap milk for whisky? :)

Hello dear Jemma, I need your advice. I really want to make buttercream for my cakes but I am alergic to milk. I tried using margarine instead of butter but the cream tastes so heavy and margarine-like. I dont like it and neither my friends. Could you tell me how to make buttercream without using milk? I can use all the vegan products, soya milk, margarine, etc. I just need to avoid milk protein. Best, Your fan

Can I use caster sugar instead of icing sugar?
Honestly, I would never recommend buttercream, it is way too sweet and sickly, if you want a nicer alternative use double cream, mascarpone cheese and icing sugar, also the flavouring of your choice x or use a meringue based cream x

Hiiiii, just watched your video . The butter cream texture looks so perfect and nice. I live in India , so if I have to leave the cake outside with the cream for more than a week I can't add milk , can I add water instead . Normally I follow 1:2 ratio . Here the sugar is bit more . To reduce sweetness can I reduce the quantity . Thanku . Madhavi
I left the butter outside too long so i put it back into th frigde but when i mix it with the hand beater it still have a layer off oill
Can i use salted butter as well?
Thank you Jemma I made it and it was fantastic
how we make colour paste
Hey Gemma! I really love your recipes and the way describe about every single details. I'm facing some problems with my buttercream frosting. But frosting tastes a bit 'grainy' 'powdery', maybe because of our local icing sugar. I saw the level, but they just wrote 'pure cane sugar' in their ingredient. Imported brands are quite costly to afford for daily life use. I'm in a bit of crisis, please tell me how can I improve it?
is there an option to make the icing less sweet, I do not like too sweet icing?
Just lovely!  👍🏻
i'm the only one who thinks that she speaks very quickly?
what if i don't have one of those mixers?
MAKE A UNICORN CAKE!!

Hello Jemma!! Firstly, I would like to congratulate you for your one million of subscribes!!! It's amazing! I love all your videos and your tips! I'm from Brazil and here is a tropical country, so its really hard to make a buttercream because of the wheather. But, I will try to do the same way you did, and watching your video, I couldn't understand when you explain about the icing sugar, something about quimical thing or something like this (video time about 3:06). Could you please tell me more about  what I should observe in an icing sugar composition? Thank you so much!!
Great tutorial, Jemma!  Thanks.  You make it all too easy to whip up butter cream! I'm subscribed!!
ugh! i love your accent lol and the fact that you have tattoos lol
I have literally watched tons of videos on the "perfect" buttercream but yours is the first to solve at least 90% of my buttercream problems. Thank you.

Hi Jemma  I've seen whipped butter in some markets, would this be an option as a BC shortcut? thank you ❤
I tried this recipe but it was not fluffy and cream it was little hard too... What to do. I also added more milk to it
If I want to make the same for cake then what would be the standard measurements ?
I'm just wondering what do you do, if you cannot get a butter with that high a fat content? We can't get that here, just regular butter, so I am wondering how the buttercream would fare or if I would have to add fat to make it as good as hers.
I did buttercream frosting but it's not smooth, I can still feel the suger powder, so I don't understand what I did wrong?
I tried making this buttercream but i think it's too sweet.... What can i add in it to lessen the sweetness?
Can I use a hand mixer?
Is it me or other too? I hate American buttercream its so buttery in your mouth and too sweet. but when I came too know about Italian buttercream, though it takes time to make but it taste far much more better.
340 gms sugar is equal to how many cups?
Hi Jemma, can you please make a tiered and layered semi-naked cake next? <3

Love the video! One question if you may please....Since it's got milk, is it food safe to leave on open counter top and for how long?
Brilliant! This recipe had my cupcakes disappearing off the platter! Thank you Jemma!
thank you jemma
2 hours set out in my nice air conditioned home in Texas and the butter melted .-.  Yesterday tried to do it with butter that seemed to be the right softness and it melted before I finished making the frosting.
I used the highest quality butter I could find but it turned out odd. Had a slight "barnyard" flavor, the texture was lovely though. What brand of butter should I use?

SOmeone help please. Thank you
Should I put my cup cakes in the refrigerator after frosting them?

Hi there!! I love buttercream and really enjoyed this video! One question tho: I am facing an "audience" who finds all varieties of buttercream far too sweet, however I am often asked to bake both cupcakes and layer cakes. What do you suggest?? Especially for layer cakes which needs stability. Ideas would be greatly appreciated!
Can we store buttercream in fridge

With this buttercream, will it hold buttercream flowers form?
Jemma, Do you have a Swiss Buttercream recipe? or a Chocolate Swiss Buttercream recipe???
Hi Jemma, I don't know if you're still checking comments but I hope you can help. I must've done your buttercream recipe a dozen of times and never failed until today...it's been super hot in London and my buttercream has curdled and it's so grainy. I've made two batches and same things happen. It's the exact same ingredients I always use but the butter do feel softer than usual...even after I put in the fridge for a bit. I tried the hairdryer method, nothing helped, it's just a gloopy grainy mess...where did I go wrong?
Just checking, with whole milk you said the buttercream would last in an airtight container for 5 days at room temp. I'm worried about the milk going off, even in Scotland - have always been advised to use milk based buttercreams the same day. Can you, or anyone, clarify please? Is buttercream made with milk ok to leave out and for how long please?
Oh how I wish I had this video as a ressource when I made my nephew's birthday cake pretty much exactly a year ago... it was so stressful and didn't end up as I wanted it to be... I don't get to bake  very often (I'm a type 2 diabetic so can't eat a lot of cake and sweet/ carby things, and it's only me and my daughter eating it when I do bake, so we end up wasting and I'm not fond of that aspect of it), but now I have your videos for next time I have a vision for a cake or something and all your helpful tips and receipes. You're awesome and you seem very sweet as a person too :)
That is quite literally the best class on how to make a butter cream I've ever seen! Thank you! I can never get my consistency quite right, so this class is extremely helpful. Can't wait to try it out!
Honestly, i only put 1 cup of sugar in the icing
How long does the buttercream last btw?
The last time I made buttercream icing, it melted or it went runny which is not very presentable. Does it have something to do with my location because I live near the equator and the room temperature can reach up to 31 degrees Celsius or something with my ingredients and how I mixed them?
No way of looking at all those tatoos!
I legit don't understand why she wants to put tattoos on her hand she is already pretty enough she doesn't need tattoos to look cool if you get what I mean
your recipe are great....
Did someone understand the part where she said which icing sugar to buy what to look in there? I heard like no calcium phosphate in the icing sugar but I am not sure of the first part look for..... in icing sugar. Because I tried this recipe and my butter cream is grainy so I guess it is because I do not have the correct kind of icing sugar? Please help.

Soho, NY?
Hi Jemma,  many thanks for your videos, I really enjoy them. Unfortunately, I am having problems with the recipe of buttercream you presented. I don't know why, but every time I add the second part of the sugar, my buttercream curdles. I even took a picture of the last batch I made, but unfortunately there is no way to attach the picture here. As you orient, I cream the butter for around five minutes, until white and pale, then add the first part of the confectioner's sugar, incorporate it slowly and increase to high speed, mixing for another 5 minutes, and then add the last part of the sugar, repeating the last step. Unfortunately, as soon as the last part of the sugar is incorporated and I increase the speed, the buttercream breaks. I even tried once to keep mixing it hoping that it would come back together again as it happens with Swiss meringue buttercream, but no matter how long I mix, it keeps the same. :( Can you help me out in identifying what I am doing wrong? Would there be a possibility to recover the mixture, once it curdles? Thanks in advance for your help.  Cheers, HW
Hey Jemma! I have a question. I would love you make my first proper cake with buttercream. I was trying twice and I was not able to make it. Today i decided to make it again :) Tell me if it will be okay to use 400g of butter and 800-1000g of suger powder? Thank you so much! Greetings from poland :)

Hi. is it perfect for fondant cake ? please let me know. Thanks in advance.
i got a question , for the butter cream, because i dont have a kitchen  aid, so i use the electical whisk, like the one for beating egg. but it didnt work well because my whisk cant go faster ,i think it got some problem. and i use hand whisk to cream the butter  and as a result my butter cream spread and cant "stand"and lag down like a semi-liq is that because i didnt whisk the butter enough before i add the icing sugar?

Hi, could you write down the specifications you said about the icing sugar I didnt get one word you said about it. Im not really used to your accent. Great video by the way I subscribed.
Jemma, how do you bring butter to room temperature? This weather is leaving butter still solid and unable to make it smooth. What do you do?
Can i add azest of lemon instead of milk?
what is the beat playing through 5:35
What I usually do if I'm baking last minute or forget to leave my butter out is I lay it on top of my oven when I'm preheating it. It's not too hot so it gets that oily coating, but enough heat seeps through to soften it.
Very helpful, thank you!
hi why does my buttercream sometimes curdal?
Thanks for the lesson in buttercream Jemma!!  I'm addicted to your channel!!  :)
Also, there was a comment you made about what icing sugar to use. You stated to buy sugar without something in it, but I couldn't make out what you were saying.  Can you clarify? Thanks!  ;)

Hi Jemma! I wondered if you can teach how to make the Korean icing that the Korean bakers use for piping flowers. They look like real flowers, glossy and translucent! I have been searching all over the internet and it is hard to find the recipe or someone who teach like you how to make it. I know that they do not use butter or egg. Their main ingredient is beans.  Please if you know how to make the Korean icing make a video for us and do a demo how to make the flowers on the flower nail.   Thank you so Jemma!

Do you have a frosting recipe that is not too sweet?
if I think my buttercream might be too sweet I use salted butter instead of unsalted or do half and half.
Would this buttercream recipe work for piping flowers?  Other recipes I've seen online include the use of shortening or lard to help the buttercream to hold its shape - would this recipe work well for that?  Thanks

Hi jemma, i tried so many times using butter cream cream icing with creamcheese and put it inside th fridge for the first coating, and and after an hour, it became watery. What is the proper technique to avoid that ? because I'll be making a red velvet cake for a client, and i'm afraid to fail.
Jemma, thank you for remembering those of us making buttercream icing in hot, tropical countries. :)
does buttercream frosting requires eggs too? i mean without heat though
One quick tip..the reason why you are adding sugar slowly is also because you can stop when you thinks when its enough...you don't have to add the exact amount of sugar as said(ur choice)
My buttercream was too watery / creamy But i realised i should add the vanilla to the milk i added it before the milk then mixed then added the milk
please Chef, can i use margarine instead of butter
Thank You!  You are a great teacher!   I feel as though I'm ready to try it!  Which is a big deal because I don't bake!

Hello can I substitute a shorten instead of butter ,and does it reflects on the test if so . Also once I have tried to do everything is right but the taste so heavy and fatty .
Hi...I need help with grams ..please
I can make a perfect angel food cake, scratch éclairs and pastry cream, caramels, heck - I can take a whole chicken and make a meal out of it, but I have never been able to make buttercream. I've even had my grandmother ( a wonderful baker) give me tips and I still go home and just fail miserably. I just followed this advice, and made a perfect vanilla buttercream in one try! You are a miracle worker. Thank you for this advise - I think it was about the particular consistency of the butter, why does no recipe specify that?
very good techniques good idea for the trick
Ms.Jemma I just want to say that I love everything about you and your channel. I watch you from Mexico and this is the recipe I used all the time. I was wonder, what if I  want to do this a chocolate buttercream?
Had to comment on this. Used this recipe for the first time today and it is literally the best buttercream I've ever made. It was so light, almost white in colour and so soft and fluffy! And there was no dreaded gritty texture. Thank you so much for sharing this one. Bookmarked for sure.
Hey I googled maize starch icing sugar and there are a lot of articles saying that the icing gets grainy with it. But Iv been using silver spoon icing sugar and that contrains tricalcium phosphate an it still comes out grainy. Also when I mix my butter it doesn't go whilst it starts to have air bubbles in it. I use a hand mixer. It's so frustrating lol
Is gel based food colour ok

Can u use a hand mixer
i tend to use silverspoon icing even though it has tricalcium phosphate because it's easy to pass it through a sieve, i've tried tate & lyle as it's always used by professionals but i really have trouble with it hardening in the packet and then it's really difficult to sift. Do you know why that could be? i store them both the same way?
I literally made this recipe and found that it was way too sweet. I was wondering how I could achieve a lighter fresh cream taste, to fill cakes etc.
could you please use both UK and American metric it really helps thank you
How much buttercream would you make for a 4 layer cake ?
Hey Jemma! Thanks again for an awesome video on buttercream. I adjusted the icing sugar a bit and added more lemon - super zingy! :)   Can I ask what type of stand mixer you're using? Is it Kmix and which series? Thanks! :D <3
I went to Crumbs and Doilies when I was visiting my friends and brother in London and tried red velvet cupcake and it was amazing. :DD
AmAzInG...👍
my buttercream is ALWAYS too runny, it's almost an oily consistency even when the temperature is not too warm when I first mix it and it makes it impossible to pipe and it ends up completely useless. I don't understand what I'm doing wrong! ple
i love you
Thank you so much for taking the time to make this video, it has been very helpful
Wow I've always tried to find a easy video on how to make butter cream icing coz I love butter cream icing it's my fave icing but never know how to make it hahaha so thank u :)
it really works!I am so happy ^^ it is the first time I manage to obtain a nice soft white buttercream!
Boy she speaks so fast 🙈🙉🙊 i dont understand a word she say
Bit of help for everybody who has difficulty finding top quality ingredients. My go to place is actually Lidl! (UK based info or anywhere which has Lidl, apologies) Lidl British Unsalted butter is basically British Lescure - perfect for baking. It has an 82% fat content, like Lescure and it is creamy soft and tastes much butter than Sainsbury's or ASDA's and it's only 95p per 250g block. Icing sugar, Tate and Lyle uses 'Maize Starch' but it's dry, lumpy and when supermarkets finally get it off of their shelves it's old and crusty. Lidl icing sugar also uses 'Maize Starch' and it is softer, smoother and less dry and crusty and it is only 65p for a 500g box. Only buy Tate and Lyle if it's a commercial purchase because it is most likely to be fresher brought that way. Obviously milk is milk just make sure it's whole, I'm not going to tell you where to buy your milk. Lidl sell vanilla pods for less than £2 I believe or I use vanilla bean paste which I don't buy from Lidl. Vanilla is the only expensive ingredient really, extract and paste both ranging between £4-8 if it is a good quality kind. I hope this helps some of your buttercream nightmares.
Jemma you're a genius! I love your recipes 😍
This made me huuuungryyyy
Jemma can I somehow use powdered color ? Liquid and paste food color are so expensive in my country ?
if I use vanilla powder how much do I have to put in so it tastes good,I haven't found extract in my nearby stores or anywhere really what do I do
I love the recipe
can we use this buttercream for layering cakes? and how much quantity do we need?
merci beaucoup
Is a wooden spoon better than an electric mixer for making cookies? And which one is better for making cupcakes and normal recipes that you make? A wooden spoon or an electric whisk?
dear jemma.. I try your receipe,but after for a while it cannot hold it shape.. any tips please.. thx
Great video!
I just started to cook and i saw this video not by you but they added dye and jelly to there butter cream. I just wanted to ask and mabye tell me why she did that. (btw love your videos :D)
how long will butter cream keep for on cupcakes?
hi Jemma. is there any different between paste colour and gel colour  ?
does this buttercream crust if i leave it out open or leave it open in the fridge?
This is such a helpful video. I want to go out and do some baking now. Decorating in baking is just the best.
I can't get enough of your channel, always learning something new!!!
Do the buttercream will sweat after you take out from the fridge?
I love to make ur butter cream, but sometimes the butter cream taste sandy because of a lot of using icing sugar. I don't know what to do n what to add in the butter cream to make it perfect and smooth like yours. Please do help to give some tips to make it perfect. tq.
Hi Jemma here from Mexico. I didnt understand the especification a bout the sugar? can you right it to me please?
For me personally, buttercream is too sweet. In Romania we prefer whipped cream or custard whipped with butter. For you this could be too fat... or not sweet enough :))
Great recipe! I can't wait to try it! I just have 2 questions, how far ahead of time can I make a buttercream vanilla cake? Do I have to make it the night before? And do you have a vanilla cake recipe?
Chocolate butter cream recipe, please!
Hi Jemma, which icing as your view doesn't loose its fluffiness after one day? Also which one doesn't give that  icing sugar  taste
I tried this today with your chocolate cupcake recipe, din;t come out that good, but I'll keep practicing until perfect. You're such an inspiration. Love. :*
Once I discovered your channel, I can't stop watching! I am beyond excited when I get to travel to Europe to try your baked goods.   Could you help? Usually when I put butter cream on my cupcakes, it doesn't tend to hold it's shape and start to melt. What would you recommend I do?
How many cups of buttercream does this recipe make?
Can I freezer that for  a day?!?
please can you do an egg free cake recipe please? my sibling is allergic.
hello , I do not understand much English I would have liked to have a written version of the video ☺ Thanks  I love your video 😍😍😍
Cupcake Jemma Good
How to avoid grainy buttercream ?  And how to powder the sugar at home ?
Jemma, can i use margarine instead of butter? And if it can't, what's the reason? Please answer me, anyone. I would really appreciate that. Thank you
I think that buttercream will be much sweet. Really too sweet with 340g of suger combine with 150g unsalt butter...
This is the best buttercream-icing video I have ever seen!! The steps were precise and i love how you explain the do's and dont's! BRAVOO!!!!
Thanks for the great tutorial.  Us novices appreciate it. :)
yummy
Hi Jemma, loved your recipe and also tried it. It was lovely.  But I didn't get that melt in the mouth feeling, I could still get the sugar graininess in my mouth. How can I get rid of that? Anything that I need to be careful about? Thank you
what is the normal temperature over there I mean room temperature??
This was so helpful! I'm gonna stick around to your channel you're amazing! <3
I've found that Maize starch makes buttercream grainy. Tate & Lyle changed their icing sugar formula earlier this year to include Maize starch and it's awful! Switched to Silver Spoon👍
She said try looking for a icing sugar that contains, may starch?
Is it necessary to use whole milk or can I substitute semi-skimmed?  will it affect the finished result.
britishhh!!!! 😍😍😍
hi how much buttercream / how many times do i double the recipe to fill, crumb coat and final coat a 8 inch cake approx 4 -5 inch high?
Jena, you are amazing! Thank you!
Hi Jemma! I was wondering if you had a recipe for christmas-y gingerbread men? I'm making some for presents in tiny jars, and I wanted some tips of what kind of buttercream goes well with gingerbread, and designs! Any ideas?
Hi Jemma, may I know how to make a nice buttercream with much less sweetness were still be able to achieve the same consistency, smooth perfect buttercream?
This was wonderful! THank you
Hey Jemma :) I want to ask where do you get those cute little spatulas you use to mix the color to the icing...looked  for a long time but didn't find those anywhere yet :-/ thank you :)
Can we sub some of the sugar with powdered milk? I see a lot of comments saying it's too sweet. :/
I've made buttercream a couple times, but the butter always starts melting as I'm whipping it. Then, I am left with a really buttery and sugary mess. When I left it in the fridge it hardened back into the consistency of regular butter except it was sweet. What did I do wrong?
how much is this recipe in cups?
like our country
hello Jemma. i just saw your video and i thought it was so inspiring and helpful! however , is it okay to substitute the whole milk to any regular milk ? will that affect the end result of the icing ?
Every time I try to make buttercream it separates. Is there a certain way to prevent that?
I didn't get the icing sugar part. Which type we should prefer?
Do you find the metal mixing bowl makes a difference? I have the glass one with my Kmix and I find the attachments don't get anywhere near the base, especially if there is a lower quantity of butter or if the butters a tad too hard
THAT BUTTERCREAM IS AMAZING!! I visited London last week and went to C&D and all I have to say is... DELICIOUS JOB!
What if i wanted to make a fruit buttercream such as pineapple or strawberry? Jams make the buttercream too sweet and fruit goo makes it too runny. Is there a way to get intensely flavoured buttercream without these problems?
are u you in crumbs and doilies soho on the 18th of dec because i am visiting London then
hi ms. jemma f u could kindly translate grams to cups in your videos please so no need to search coz im usually using cup measurements..thank u
could this be done in a food processor??
Hey Jemma, with what can I substitue golden syrup if I can't get a hold of any?
Jemma I don't have caster sugar when I live. Is caster sugar granulated sugar
At what temperature was the  milk, that you used ? Cause the last time I put in liquid to my buttercream they formed lumps. :(
What temperature of the milk did you use ? Cause the last time I put in liquid to my buttercream they formed lump. s youo can I please know the temperature
I like how you give notes for hot countries cause I live in Jamaica and no way could I leave butter out overnight 😂
Hey Jemma! I'm vegan but i still love your videos and i like to veganize your recipes! My problem is that in my country we dont really have many options for vegan butter and my buttercream never looks that fluffy and smooth! :( Do you recomend a certain company's vegan butter for better results? Also, should i change the analogy of the recipe? Thank you! Lots of love <3
Hey jemma love your videos. 😊 plz do a video on tips to start your own cake business from home. Thanxs

Hi Jemma, i was wandering if you could make a Fantastic Beasts or Harry Potter themed cake for the release of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. Also it is  my friends birthday and i would like to make her one. I know that i and probably  many more would want a tutorial on this but no one is  asking,  but i would really love it if you would. thanks M Murtza
I want you to make some delicious ice cream if it's possible!!!!!!#mymomwants this!!!!!!!!!!!!
Will this work for icing the outside of a layer cake?
Thanks Jemma Love your all videos.
hi which brand of icing sugar do u use
I struggle so much with getting the butter to room temperature :'( It's always either too solid or a melty puddle, never in between. :(
what is the best butter that you can find in normal supermarkets? i grew up using stork but stopped and now im using lurpak however the butter cream is never thick, and i follow all the instructions
If you want to make the icing super white for snowman cupcakes add a tiny touch of purple gel colour as this neutralises the cream/yellow tone 😉🍰
I live in a country where are room temp. is 35-40 degrees Celsius. Can I still leave my icing out at room temp. or should I put it in the fridge?
I just created an awesome butter tip! If your butter is frozen, or in the fridge, take your butter and place it in a ziplock bag without any air! Then fill a tall glass with hot/ warm water and place it in the glass. I use a small bowl to keep the butter down in the water. And even with frozen butter. It takes only 20 minutes to soften. It feels like it has been sitting out all night!
Hi Jemma  My buttercream always gets grainy 🙁 dnt know whats wrong , I follow the exact recipe , I even us timer while beating . Plz plz plz help
Can I reduce the icing sugar? Is the buttercream suppose to taste so sweet?
Can you do this by hand? I don't have a stand mixer!😔
Your near to 1 million!!!!! GOOD JOB 👏🙌👏🙌👏🙌
Hi jemma. I live in the Philippines where it is very hot and humid. Whenever I make buttercream it always turns out very liquidy even without milk. I looked up on Google how to make humidity proof icing and some suggested to add two tbsp of corn starch. After doing that my icing turned out extremely crunchy on the top after I piped it on my cupcakes. To be honest, the only successful frosting that I have made was Swiss meringue. Please give me some tips for a smooth humidity proof buttercream frosting.                💜G.
If you are using an electric hand mixer, mixing at a high speed for 5 minutes can result in the motor getting pretty warm which has me worried about abrasion inside the mixer ultimately damaging the hand mixer. Any advice here?
Heyy Jemma.. Thanks for the video. its of great help. :) Love your cupcakes and Whenever I make them all my friends love them too... Love your way of teaching... love you loads...:) :)
And a video with all types of decorating equipments and we're to get it from
Christmas cupcakes please
Will a hand mixer do the same job?
Can you make ahead and freeze buttercream?
Hello Jemma, I have a problem with making buttercream where after I added the 2nd batch of icing sugar, the mixture starts to split into a horrible mess... why is it so?
Love love love love it. Tfs♡♡♡
What if mine is too sweet ?
what is the best way to judge how much buttercream you should make?  Every time I try using the quantities a recipe give me I always end up with too little buttercream to cover my cake
Jemma, is it possible to substitute the milk with sweet condensed milk? And sometimes, I find my buttercream a bit grainy, please advise, thanks a bunch! 🙏
what brand of powdered sugar do you use because my buttercream is always grainy
do you have a royal icing tutorial?
Why is my buttercream always runny and liquidy? What should i do to prevent it?
How long did you beat it for? beginning to end
how much butter????
I have searched the Internet so much and can't find what I'm looking for. There's this grocery store throughout my state that has a bakery, for their cakes and cupcakes they have this extremely light and not too sweet frosting. Any idea what it could be?
If I want to make a fruit flavoured buttercream and I know that the juice of fresh fruit can cause it to break, what do you recommend?
I don't have a paddle attachment with my stand mixer, I have the twin beaters, are there any tips or tricks you would recommend since I don't have the paddle attachment?
love it

Is she gaya.
Can you please do a carrot cake ..?
My hero
I did a nicely pale and fluffy icing trying it for the first time already, but it was too sweet, so I started to use your recipe, but adding less sugar. I love your recipes however! :3
is this enough buttercream to fill and cover a cake?!
I don't like buttercream! I've been to Crumbs & Doilies and I have to say your buttercream was on the verge of liking. Best one I ever had! I just prefer something like crème mousseline.
Is there any way to make buttercream with less sugar but the same consistency? I love the consistency but I find it way too sweet, especially on a cake that is already quite sweet. I've experimented with putting in less sugar, but it really affects the consistency.
Thank you so much for this I could never ever get my butter cream right ;(( but thank youuu so much :)
How to make flavoured butter cream not only with colour e.g grape mango orange blue berry chocolate flavoured and coloured  butter cream ?
Hello Jemma ! Thanks for your videos. I am making some patisserie and when needed a frosting, I always use a French buttercream but I wanted to try this type of buttercream. The problem is that despite that I sieve the sugar and respect the mixing time, the mixture always remains grainy. I don't understand where I am making wrong.  I am in Turkey and I tried both of the best brands we know, the problem is recurrent. I need your help and advice please. Thank you very much and lots of love from Turkey 😙

I love your videos so much
omg, i have been to london 1 month ago and i forgot to visit your shop😢😢😢 (crying)
Ahh i get it why I can't pipe my buttercream out always.My butter was not soft enough and i did not mix the butter long enough too.Thanks jemma and btw,i am always using ur recipes cause ur cakes recipes are just so perfectly soft:)
Is color gel and color paste the same? :3
Where did you get your rubber spoon/spatula? I've been looking for one and can't find but I love yours! :)
Wow, I didn't know you could store it in room temperature for that long! I have always stored my buttercream in the fridge because I thought it would go bad otherwise. Thanks for telling us. =)
how do you get your eyeliner looking so perfect in each video?!
hi Jemma :) thank you for the wonderful videos x. With the silly season coming up, can you inspire us with some baking gift ideas? cookie/cupcake hamper/wrapped DIY presents :) thank you x
hi jemma... i wanted to ask what can we do to avoid crispiness after a while?  i mean that at first its fine without feeling the sugar k after a bit that i froast my cupcakes it created a crust outside.... i had them on my counter, without a box...
Hi Jemma isn't it necessary to add Meringue powder into the mix as a stabilizer?
I've tried lots of buttercream recipes but this one is by far my favourite. It works every time 😊
Hi! I was wondering if you ever use vegan butter to make buttercream and if you have any tips on that! I really like your videos and appreciate the time and effort you put into making them! Thank you!
CupcakeJemma, You mentioned for advanced storage, that the buttercream is able to keep at room temperature for upto 5 days. My concern is that there is  milk incorperated, would that affect the taste? Can we also store it in the fridge?
I have tried so much time but it turned sugary .why so? I used icing sugar
Your video helped me so much!😊
but i make a swiss meringue buttercream it's pretty salty
LOVED this video, Jemma. It's great that you're always open with us and share ALL of your tips. I've never heard you say "I can't tell you this, it's the company's secret" or some BS like that ;D You're very keen on giving us all the opportunity to make C&D like cupcakes at home :) so THANK YOU
hi, didn't want to thumbs down, but the music while your talking is so annoying. arrghh. had to turn sound off. perhaps its just me.
OMG...too much sugar...
"Horrible crispy nuggets" sounds fine by me.
Is there anyway to make nice buttercream but with less sugar?
i would be very interested in frosting options. i've made your buttercream a few times, but it's simply too buttery and sweet for my taste. it's too massive. what else can i do on cupcakes? and could i just half the amount of sugar, probably this affects the consistency..
Make a cake with my name my name is olivia
Your the best i want to cake with you😃😂😀
Hi jemma my name is olivia. I love you😍😘💗💖💝
can I make it in a blender?
That was so helpful, thank you.
You are tooooo good jemma
Hi Jemma... Can you please share how to flavour the buttercream? Like dark chocolate or white chocolate or even fruit "goo"... What is the quantity to be added without losing the consistency.. Thanks for the masterclass : )
Hey Jemma, I loved ur video...I had been searching for a good video on buttercream....thank you so much but please help me a little more...what is the exact weight of buttercream that is prepared with these measurements?
how do you thicken up icing without making it too sweet? I made it exactly the way you did and it was still too soft for piping (it wasn't hot in my house or anything). I used regular unsalted butter. once it was made but was too soft, could I have put it in the fridge for a little bit to firm it up?
Thank you!! I do live in a country near the equator so it is hot, thank you for tips when you are in a warm temperature, and what icing sugar to look for! because i dont like the grainy texture. Thank youuu!! :D
can u use the wisk attachment on your mixer to make the icing lighter or is the K beater better?
I love your channel Jemma, but I tried both of your buttercream and cream cheese frosting recipe, both came out wayyyyyy toooooooo sweettttttt (even my family said so). I was very upset that I wasted lots of butter and cream cheese because no one would eat it, my family including myself just scrap it off the cake and the whole batch of frosting ended up in the garbage, what a shame! well everyone has different taste bud, good luck for whoever try the recipe!
What if the icing gets watery what can we do?
Do you ever not use a electric mixer?
I feel like recipes that i follow ( which i arnd the same) like zoella and cupcake gemma, the icing comes out SO sweet and i  can actl see sugar crystals in it??? I whipped it for a very long time tho. Maybe its my blender? or maybe i cant bake lol
Hey Jemma! What if you want buttercream that isn't quite as sweet? Will the consistency be messed up if you just put in less sugar? xx
Love watching your videos!! Can you show your version of a Boston Cream Pie?
This as a great video, Jemma....very helpful!  I'm wondering if you have to mix the vanilla in with the milk or can you add it separately?  It seems that if you don't end up using all of the milk, you'll then be missing some of the vanilla flavor also.
Awesome!! Thank you for sharing!!
Buttercream - yummy! Thanks for sharing your "brilliant buttercream!"
Hi Jemma ..... would you make a devils food cake  or any chocolate cake .... I love chocolate
@cupcakejemma I have tried, and thankfully completed successfully most of your cupcake recipes. But the one thing that I had most problem with was the buttercream. I have noticed that you use the icing sugar a little more than double the amount of the butter in all your videos. Is that ratio absolutely necessary for the perfect buttercream? Does it work the same if we add a little less of the sugar? And also, does using an electric whisk affect the outcome any differently?
Its just wayyyy tooo sweeet :(
i have no questions , i just wanted to let you know that i LOVE you. 💙💙💙💙
Why do u use the paddle attachment as opposed to the balloon attachment ?? Love you + ur videos !! When my mom went to England I made sure she bought ur book for me because I couldn't find it here lol 💟💟
can you sho us how to make your unicorn rainbow cake? please~ they are just so freaking cute!!!!!!!!!!!!
when I over whipped, it slightly melts. not as fluffy as yours. is it because in Indonesia is so humid and hot?
these are the videos i live for. thanks, jemma!
hi jemma! can you give us a link on where you get your coloured pastes from?
Jemez, can I make buttercream frosting by hand? I don't have a standard or hand mixer at home. My home is kinda small and it doesn't have a lot of storage.
Jemma, i live in tropical country, and i try make this recipe once but the consistency is too soft. what should i do? i didnt add milk cause its already too soft to work with.
I’ve seen some recipes for buttercream that has shortening in it. What’s the reason behind some using that and others not?
hi jemma just wanted to know when i make buttercream like yours there is an after taste how can i make buttercream without the after taste of icing sugar ty
That buttercream is so perfect! Thank you for the tips. The buttercream I always make is not perfect. When I put it in the cake after how many minutes it melts because of the temperature here in Philippines.
You said 5 days room temperature, how long in the fridge?
Thank you so much for making this video, Jemma! It's awesome! :D
what if i used hand mixer? its okay ?
love love love your channel. I see another person has asked this but I really want to know as well, how do you figure out how much butter to the amount of sugar is there a set ratio. for making different amounts of butter cream it would be handy to know the basis 😍 xx
i can't found one
my problem in our country doesn't have a unsalted butter
I really suck at making icings i hope i can pull this off :(
Also!!! Since you bake at home often, you must experience uneven heating? Eggs, cupcakes, cakes, macarons. ALWAYS the outer ridge (not edges of the individual goodies) cooks faster. My cakes don't rise at the same as outsides. My macarons on the outsides raise before the centre of the pan does. Is the heat from the bottom collecting at the top and providing more eat to the outer areas? I use an oven thermometer and the middle is my desired cooking temperature. 🤔 Any fix?
love your videos! thank you Cupcake Jemma!!
I've been waiting on this video for so long. Is there an alternative to using butter? I know someone deathly allergic to dairy (anaphylaxis) and I'd love to make it dairy free. Does shortening work? Or vegan margarine?
Hi Jemma, can I reduce the amount of icing sugar when making buttercream? Because if I do exactly the tutorial, my cream turns out to be so sweet. Thanks.
What type of vanilla extract do you use?  I notice it is very thick.
What piping bag do you use?
Wait wait wait wait...  crispy icing nuggets sound kind of delicious.
My butter is 99 percent fat
How about gel food coloring? That is the only coloring I have
This was very helpful!
I never get this result even with an electric hand whisk because I donnait have any kitchen aid or electric mixer ... and the taste always feels like it has lumps of sugar so it is not good at all... any advice ? :(
♥♥
Nice video
jemma would you recommend the k beater mixer as mine has just died after 45 years and see so many on the market
Hi Jemma do you know how to make a less sweet buttercream frosting? Thx i love you xx
What are your thoughts on ermine icing?
OMG!!! I  was in need of this video.... Thanks a ton... Loads of love from Arizona <3 <3
Can you do a video on french macarons? Love your videos, I learn so much!
Hi jemma you did it again. another great video. Is your buttercream as sweet as some bought ones, if so how can we take some of the sweetness out.
Thank u so much Jemma, u r so lovely 😊 .. and i really like ur videos .. and can u please tell me if i add more sugar in my better wt can i do for fix it 😭
Can you make this using a hand-whisk?? Thank you xx
biscoff please, pretty please. 😍😍
thank you Jemma...u r the best...love ya <3
love your vids.  one suggestion...the background music is distracting when you are talking.
Hey Jemma, I don't have instagram or twitter but I do LOVE making your stuff and I always upload my pictures on pinterest (https://uk.pinterest.com/misscelticfox/cakes-decorations-and-more/) the cookie cup cupcakes were AMAZING!!! Everyone in my flat LOVED them so thanks for that recipe! ^-^ xxx
Super loved 😍 this video especially having the tips on if you live in a hot country which is where I am from 🌴🌴☀️🍹🏖🏝 and I always tend to have those issues so your tips and tricks will be helpful when I'm back home !! Thank you !!
Best masterclass on buttercream online! Thank you so much for all your tips. I can't get enough of your videos!
Just wondering how you would suggest storing an iced cake until it's time for serving!
I live in Florida so straight up butter is just not going to work so I always substitute 1/3 of the butter with margarine and add a dash of butter extract. I love her videos and learned about the maize powder additive being better for powdered sugar frosting, I gotta try a powdered sugar recipe for thanksgiving (I favor the cooked flour frosting personally).
Jemma pleeeeease make a video for the biscoff cake/cupcakes!!
Can I use this recipe to cover and fill a cake? or Does it have different process?
Do you employ people often because when I'm older I would love to work at crumbs and dollies. Btw I love your vids. Xxx
IF I made my butter cream too loose is there any way to save the batch or do I need to make another one? Can I whip my butter cream too much?
+CupcakeJemma Hello Jemma, are you supposed to still feel and taste the tiny sugar grains in the buttercream? Thank you!
👏🏻🙏🏻👍🍰
This literally answered ALL my questions about buttercream!
Can you overwhip the buttercream?
i usually just need a little teaspoon of liquid. Is that normal?
Thank you Jemma for another brilliant tutorial. Always simple and easy to follow. LOLxx
I think ya'll are the only ones I know to actually make Buttercream, not a meringue.
We only have margarine in my house and it's way softer than butter, will that affect the consistency of the buttercream if I use the same measurements?
I love the way you say buttercream 😂😂
Thank you for your video! I love making buttercream but always had a yellow tint on my vanilla buttercream even after using right the measurements..now I know I have not mixed it for long enough! Also I didn't know it's good to mix it for 3-5 mins between each lot of icing sugar so that is another tip I have learnt. Thanks again 😊😊
Hi jemma....i would like to know which colour paste brand is good??
Can I use margarine instead of butter? Or what other substitute could I use? I'm on a dairy free diet
Pleaseeeee do a video on how to do drip cakes
I always whip my butter with a hand mixer, then add the sugar a little at a time and mix with a wooden spoon, then back to the hand mixer to whip until light and fluffy. best method I've found yet :)
So this is pipe able??
This is a silly question but why is buttercream so sweet?
I've seen you don't use a Kitchenaid but a Kmix, why? I may buy one of those mixers and I'd like to know the reasons why you prefer one and not the other! thanks in advance x
Mine is always gritty and too sweet... probably down to impatience with the electric mixer
can u make a mirrror glaze cake plz
This is too sweet for me. I prefer French Buttercream
You said store room temp up to five days.. you don't recommend refrigerating?
Would love for you to do a Terry's Chocolcate Orange cupcake video! :) xx
thank god jemma your the best I need to improve making my butter cream
Jemma, you're the prettiest Lady I've ever seen. And your English is amazing
you couldn't have posted this at a better time! I've been asked to make a cake for my best friends baby shower and butter cream is the least of all my 'strong baking' talents lol! Life Saver!
Jemma, is there a rule for the buttercream measurements? a proportion? I mean, sometimes I just need a little less or more. it would be good to have a basis of the amounts. thank you so much! love what u do!
how can I make cream that similar to the buttercream but less sweet?
Thank you!
Hey Jemma so i was wondering if you could do cakes with a wooden spoon because i dont have a kitchen aid and i find it difficult to move it and mix it around to make it to your consisdensy. Also i am struggling to make liquid icing using icing sugar and water. please could u make a video on that as i find that there are load of lumps and a bit watery. Thank u xx
How would you make chocolate buttercream?
Very interesting video, Jemma. Thanks for the awesome video!
Jemma what type of icing sugar do you use as I would like to know so I can put it on the top of my mums birthday cake
How much buttercream does  C&D make in a month?
I've spent all morning binge watching all of your videos, and now I'm hungry for some cake. Hahaha. Maybe I'll try my hand at one!
My icing always curdles when I add milk WHYYYYY?!?!?!!!!!!! Please help 💕
Awesome tips Jemma! :)
i just need a C&D recipe of an 8" vanilla cake👐👐👐
My problem with buttercream is when i try to add colour i can never get a good colour as the buttercream is quite yellow even if you whip it until it's very pale, any idea on the best colourings to use  or how i can overcome this problem?
I had a horrible experience coloring buttercream red. I wanted a deep vibrant red but it was very light. I added more red dye and it ended up tasting like a toxic chemical. How do you achieve darker colors without jeopardizing the taste of the buttercream with excessive dying?
I love when you say "Horrible".
why is it that we have to use unsalted butter??? .Thank you
l too find it too sweet plz help jemma
hello Jemma. Love your movie. Do you have some recipies or advices if I want to flavor buttercream with fruits? For example with whole strawberries not chemical flavor. Also how much can I reduce the sugar becouse it is way to sweet for my taste...
please do a recipe on biscoff cupcakes!
Jemma, do u recommend a kitchen aid artisan or one of the kenwood mixer ( if it's the case, which one)??
Can you please do a chocolate fudge buttercream! Xx
thank you so much.
I like your tutorial
Id really like to see you do a Yule log! I bet it'd be amazing. :)

BISCOFF CAKE 🍚🍥
Vanilla links?
your are lovely for sharing your hints and tips. THANK YOU! #jemmacupcake
When you said to avoid icing sugar with Tricalcium Phosphate and look for maize starch instead, did you mean the opposite? I've just been googling to try and find some with maize starch, and couldn't find any - then google started bringing up results of bakers saying that icing sugar with maize starch makes buttercream grainy, and to look for Tricalcium Phosphate instead? I love your channel by the way, it's beautiful and so inspiring :) Thank you
How about refreshing the buttercream stored in the fridge? should leave at room temperature and beat it again or what's the best way to refresh it?
that really helped me thanks Jemma!
Just made your caramel popcorn Jemma.🍿😊

Yuummmyy 😍 check my chanel for cakes and more 🤗
Loved it!! Thank you!
Yaasssss I can't wait to make this 🔥🔥❤️❤️😜😜😜
If you use such an amount of sugar, isn't the buttercreme way to sweet? I mean 340g sugar on 125g butter is quite a lot ^^
Erm where is the vanila extract link?
that looks so fluffy! Amazing!

i really love your videos! i live in the Dominican Republic, a bummer to me, cause i would LOVE to go to C&D and eat my heart out! keep up the greatness! love u lots😍❤️
My problem with making buttercream frosting is that almost every recipe out there's way too sweet for my liking, but I find that reducing the amount of sugar affects its structure and texture. Any thoughts and tips for this Ms. Jemma?  Also, PS. I'd really love to know the kind of turntable you're using xx
buttercream doesn't survive the Philippine Weather. 😞
