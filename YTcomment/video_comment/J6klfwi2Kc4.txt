Whenever I make this recipe my cornbread falls off of the hot dog when I put it in the oil.
How much oil
Holy corn-dog heaven!! BLAZE green MEDICINE YA'LL! ! ♧÷♧
Do the hot dogs have to be cooked before skewering them and placing the batter on top to fry?
Where are the measurements for this recipe?
Watching this at 2:52 am, stomach is growling 😫
Why no recipe...this is why we watch your channel and are subscribed...what gives..
Corn dogs are never a thing in my country, never tried it but now I'm hungry for one.
I love your recipe*
Lol I hope your finger is OK I want your recipe thank you  🙏🏻😻
I can't find your recipe for this!
Hi Laura do you need to boil the sausages first before coating and frying it?
Hack: substitute the dogs with mozzarella sticks/cheese strings
Yummmy
Laura can you do an episode on sausage, egg and cheese biscuits? Or bacon, egg and cheese, whatever you like more?
Could you please step away from the table more and turn around a little more so we can see some of the hidden?  Reach for more stuff behind you, or something like that. Thanks!
U really make food look so good! Thanks
awesome , thank you XD
No cheese?
Is corn meal compulsary
What type of oil did you use?
OOOOOh my Goood I need a bloopers/bts video <3
Looks great! How do I make the batter thicker? I like a lot of thick batter on my corn dog.
Her batter was a lil runny tho
Because I can't like egg
Egg is important
Omg
i’m so hungry now omfg
You know what's a real corn dog! "HYUK" Disney's GOOFY, that's who!! "Garsh!"
How would I freeze these to reheat
where we should buy that cornmeal
I can't find the written recipe
I like it how she says butter
If you have cornbread mix, is it possible to just use that?
This is by far my favorite thing to watch as I diet down into my bodybuilding shows. Thanks Laura for making amazing food and curbing my hunger.
Very nice
I'm obsest of these since ive seen your recepie
maple syrup is the best on corndogs!
i can do this with not milk?
Love ur videos
what can i use instead of buttermilk?they dont sell it where i live
skip the sugar and add honey much tastier :D
can you make the sausage and pancake on a stick? I was curious if you cook sausage ahead before battering or not?
what sausages were you useing
yummoooooo, gonna make tonight
Just finish making these, epic fail for me. Batter came out good but it won't stick to the sausages. How does yours stick Laura?
I have livd in Norwey all my life and never sen corndogs
Loved it! But in my country we don't have buttercream, so can I make this recipe just with milk???
this recipe does not work my corndogs look like pancakes with hotdogs inside plus the corn dogs have a lot of fat in them because of the butter.
I kept laughing and replaying at the end :)
yummy delicious
they look like uncircumcised penises
Am I the only one that double dips my corndogs? I put them I batter, fry them and dip them again and fry them again so they will be thick and delicious! :)
Hey question, I wanted to use bacon covered hot dogs, should I cook them a little before putting the batter on and frying them? Or is that something I won't have to worry about?
Ooh u know  how to  make  candy?
noh my god! mini corndogs with toothpicks as skewers...amazing cx
Is there any substitute for cornmeal? I know it's probably an  important ingredient considering it's corndogs, but I live in norway and it might be difficult to find.
I just tried to make this and it didn't turn out the same 😑
Everyone pause at 4:21!
great season for those NBA can't wait lol dip sauce honey mustard
Laura can make anything look delicious. I never wanted a corn dog so bad in my life
how far along is she? cant even tell on her belly its so flat :D
Wow that was really great
can I use all whole milk because I cannot find buttermilk.
I'm here for the belly
Make chicken Caesar salad please
i love your cooking
thank you so much for sharing.
.....if you mix mustard and ketchup together, like a sauce, and dip the tip of the corn dogs into it, it is so good, try it you will love the dip
can u do a semseme chicken recipe
show us how to make funnel cake plz
o m gosh Laura where are you leading your flock
nice recipe looks so good
make a red velvet cheesecake from the Cheesecake Factory
The best corn dogs are from derwienersntchzel they are worth the effort of making them your only corn dog destination
I can even hear you swallow lol.
Can you freeze them?
what can i use to substitute buttermilk if i got nothing with that name in my country?
Best pogo ever!!!!!
Something about watching Laura eat that corn dog is so appealing.
do the hot dogs need to be fully cooked before staring this recipe?
I tried this and cornbread kept coming of of the dogs what was I doing wrong
Hey Laura! Try making your batter thicker and it will completely cover the hot dog. Fry a bit longer. Made your recipe with those changes and wow! yummy!
I love this!!! Thank you so much Laura, I have always wanted to try corn dogs because I hear so much about them but they're sooo expensive! Now I can make them at home! Jesus why didn't I think of this! Can't wait to try these bad boys!!! XD Btw, you're the cutest lol that ending was too cute!
I've waited my entire life for this video. Love Laura. Love corndogs. #Blessed.

Hello Laura, I think we met on hi5 unless somebody else hacked your account, it's a pleasure to find you here
please make bomboloni or sporcamuss please laura please !
hy Laura I've made corndogs yesterday using your recipe..I don't know what went wrong but it was a complet desaster I've followed the steps of this recipe exactly, the measurements, the temperature of the oil, everything...and it didn't work out. Also the batter looked very loose in the first place. I don't know why it didn't work out 😔
hey Laura..you haven;t showed us any sizzler recipes....
Omgggg, why am I watching this at 11pm... I'm drooling... Must.get.corndog.now....
I tried this last night and the cornbread just fell off in the fryer. busted.
you should make some macaroons
Congrats...!! food awesome keep doing what you love to do
My three inch corn dog has won awards in many homes across the nation.
Maple syrup is the bomb on corndogs!
You MUST coat the hot dogs with flour before you dip the corn dog in the batter. If not, your batter will not stick and will float to the top, leaving your hot dog bare.
What I find is a delicious substitute is instead of a hot dog weenie use a sausage.
Can't wait till your tummy starts to get big. I wonder what you will be craving too food wise. Bet we will see weird stuff posted LOL
Please make cookie dough brownies
I love the blooper at the end lol love you Laura

Shane Dawson will love these😀😀😀
Am I the only one who has never tried corn dogs?

Bread pudding recipe? 😘

This looks so easy!! I'll have to try this!

Me encanta!
Laura if possible for ur next video could you make an Indian recipe. Thank you
goddamn Laura I've never seen such a beautiful woman
how much of the dry ingredients of each do you put in?
Haha!!! You should do a blooper reel at the end of this year with all the silly and crazy stuff that happens that we don't see. Id love to see that. Lol. Another awesome recipe, love you Laura!
Thank you for sharing.  They look so delicious.
is there any way of making them with pancake mix and not so many ingredients? I want to make them but all I have is pancake mix and salt will that work?
this video got me hard
wWi
When you posted this video, you had just under 2.5 million. Now 2 days later you have 2.5 million+, so Congratulations and wish you lots more success.

Finally!!
Literally went on your channel last week looking for a corn dog recipe! Haha
These look soooo good Laura! 😍
Thanks Jet.
You should get a tripod.
Please make a video on stuffed crust pizza! 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Ugh you're too perfect
pause at 4:21 lol wow
Corn dogs are just corn bread covered hot dogs?? Mind blown.
Only here cuz corn dogs were mentioned in the philosophy of Kanye West
how do u know if the hot dog is evenly cooked on the inside tho?
MILF OMG ❤️❤️❤️
she is beautiful
Milf
Why don't you pre-boil the hotdog to ensure its cooked before deep frying. I just don't feel like 3 minutes is enough to cook the dog.
you're eyes are gorgeous . I guess the dogs are too
wood pipe
something about a woman cooking mmmm
Super cool!

I love watching laura cook I have learned so much from her and I have grown up cooking I'm a southern girl from North Carolina 💙 learned all the secrets from my grandma of course but since I started watching laura in the kitchen on YouTube when she started idk she just shows you different things and she helped me love  to cook again because I had gotten burn out of it so I watch her everyday 💟💟

never had corn dogs
M.I.L.F Spotted
Those look good af
*I ❤💛💚💙💗💖💝 corn dog*
Tip: If you spin the dog while you are putting it in the oil you will get perfect full coverage.
oh boy
They look good. Can you make corn dogs using instant corn bread mix? The mix that comes in the small boxes.
Thanks for the recipe for the corndogs
I'm just gonna fry some cornbread mix because I only like the breading lol
BLACKPINK in YOOOo AAARRRREEEAAAAAA
This channel looks like it could be on Food Network...
What can I substitute the milks with if I can't have dairy ? Can I do almond milk or soy?
is the buttermilk really necessary?
You can tell she's a freak in the sheets
What are you going to do with this much oil afterwards? How long can I keep it? I would never finish using this amount of oil just cooking dishes the usual way in one year. Somebody help please!
Thank you!
2:37 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
omg you are sooo beautiful.
LAURA ARE U MARRIED???
The corndog on the right of the thumbnail looks like my weenie
I bet they are 🔥😁😍
when frying like u did, do i just put a lot of oil into a pot and wait till its hot? or is it a special oil?
FINALLY!!!! I've been waiting for this recipe a LONG time.
That's what she said! Lmao
fannnntasticccc!!!!!!  :D
Where did u get the sticks?
Again I'm drooling
Pause at 4:20/4:21 Time2Fap
wtf why is your watch on your right hand!?
These look amazing! I'm going to do this with veggie dogs, yum. Thanks Laura :)
Laura, Please make Italian Meringue Buttercream!
Please, Do Not Throw The Leftover Batter, Instead bake the batter in cupcake silicone moulds or glass container on high for 1 minute(additional 15 sec if required). Waste less food! Thanks Laura for a lovely recipe.
howtobasic cooks better than you.
I wonder if you could cook these in an air fryer?
Any one else smiled when she said ”add my egg”..???:p
Omg I can't believe how simple corn dog are to make
Crispy homemade didlos
yesss pancake sausage version!!!
Corn dogs always look good but I don't really like the taste of them when I actually have them so that's a struggle :/
Question: would this work with a bigger, "artisan"-type of sausage (as opposed to a hot dog)? I'm thinking Italian sausage, Kielbasa, bratwürst, etc..  Thanks!
I wonder when we are going to get videos based on what her pregnancy craving is that day i can't wait
your are so awesome Laura.. all your videos are so amazing you're such a sweet person.oh and  congratulations so happy for u 🌸🤗
For the price of all that crap you listed I could get a ticket to the damn state fair and buy 10 fried hot dogs there.
The thumbnail looks like a bunch of dicks haha 😂
i've been waiting on this!!!
what's the difference between a corn dog and a hot dog.
Lol loved the end haha ur so funny Laura!
I am a deep frying failure.  Does anybody know what to set the temperature at to get the oil hot enough to fry, but not too hot?  Medium?  Medium High?
You skipped showing the hard part which is getting it out of the oil without burning the house down
Good channel, community good enough to not see 69 sexist jokes, and helping with cooking? Probs gonna sub.
Idubbbz did it better
I just ate like 3 kilograms of fruit and I'm still hungry ! :(
Damn Laura be whippin
your cup must be enough for the hotdog..! that's what she said
when you hit your finger lmao
Can these be baked in the oven instead of deep-fried?
Can you make the breakfast version of these, 'pancake on a stick'? Pretty please :D
can you try to make any kind of sushi ???????????? LOVE YOU
I've never eaten Corn Dogs in my hole life. When I was younger all the people in the US series ate that and I always wanted to try it, too. Maybe now I will try it. Thank you :)
I don't have cornmeal 😣
The corndog you at looked like an uncircumcised penis😂😂

Laura,can you please make a kinder pingui cake and a lemon cake?  :D :)
Hey Laura, thanks for the video. I really like your recipes and I love watching your videos. Could you please do a video on types of cookware (pans, casseroles, etc)  that one must have in their kitchen. All traditional and fancy?
Love the vids Laura !!!
Amazing as always!
What if I don't have baking soda nor buttermilk- all I usually carry is 2%milk:) can I still do this? I have a bag of aunt Jemima corn meal- is this what I'd use?
Laura can the batter be kept in the refrigerator? If so...how long?
Laura, make Spanakopita(Greek Spinach Pie) please! Thank you!

What kind of sauces go w. corn dogs. I usually eat them by themselves
Great job!👍Makes me want to make some😊You make it so simple Laura tfs.Have a nice day.🌼
Totally awesome. Adding a little heat to the batter like some sriracha would make these taste so good too for those that like a little spice.
Hi Laura! do You think it is possibile to switch to rice flour to have a gluten free version of corn dogs?
My belly is crying for these...
Summer's here? Summer's over.
You can use pancake or tempura batter. With pancake you can dip it in syrup

Nice watch

I've never known what was inside a corn dog, because I never saw a photo of a corn dog split open. It wasn't important enough for me to look up. I've always thought there was a hotdog inside, but this finally confirms it. Wow.
Pero Laura why do you do this to me 😩 lol they are definitely my guilty pleasure that I have once a year lol.
Thank you, Laura! I had the best corn dog when I went to Disneyland so about a week ago I searched your channel to see if you had a video, and now you do!
