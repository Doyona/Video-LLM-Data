Where are the Macros for this recipe?   How many carbs/fat/protein does a muffin have?
These are delish! I substituted psyllium husk for the oat fibre, and I used peanut butter protein powder instead of vanilla. I baked them in the oven for 18 minutes on 350 and they came out just wonderfully!!!!
Why does it take over 7 minutes to show how to cook a 1 minute muffin?
This sounds awesome!
Gr8 Werk...  Great Work
In the ingredients list you skipped erythritol, why? What kind is that? Im asking bc im creating a grocery list...Stevia tastes disgusting! Can I buy this at a Natural store? I live in a small town and travel a lot so I need to know if I can get this from AZ.
can they be baked in the oven? also where do you get the erythritol?
You have forgotten the eggs in your incredients list.
