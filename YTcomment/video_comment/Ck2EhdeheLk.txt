Dear Christopher, this looks very clear and professional. Would it be possible to do men's basic bodice as well ? Would make me very happy.
Is it normal for high point of shoulder to be longer than back of neck to waist? I googled how to measure to double check but it’s still 1/5 longer
Sir i have one doubt  If i want a deep back neck what alterations should be done to shoulder measurement
This is very helpful video, thank you! Could you please explain why the underarm goes so far down, why not measure high bust also and lead the arm opening only to there?
Sir why you did make more videos
😘
Any trouser patterns coming soon?
Something I can't understand is what is the line across up in the bust line called regal line where arm curve stop
I must say thank you sir,  your video is professionally done with easy to follow and understanding. I almost gave up hope as a beginner wanting to make my own clothes. I will definitely make a mock up and post my results. Once again thank you after I have brought books recommendations patterns and a bunch of tools based on other videos , only to be left stuck and confused without a single bodice block😢,  I know the video I’m watching is old however I must say it’s still doing exactly what you put it up to do thank you so much. I truly hope you get this message sir.
You've absolutely earned a follower in me.  I promise to learn well and utilize what I learn from you.  Thank you
Absolutely the easiest bodice sloper drafting method.  I did it straight onto some fabric (just used a bit of tracing paper for moving the front armhole dart) and sewed it up quickly, great fit. I didn't quite follow the front armhole needs to be smaller rule and ended up with 1/4" extra fabric...so follow that rule haha.  I've tried other drafting methods and they're so convoluted! they require lots of tweaking and usually too tight.  This will be so easy to adapt for patterns.
Love your videos pls keep posting
I'm going to give this tutorial a try! For the checklist girlies like myself, here is the written list of measurements he has you take:  -Back high point shoulder to waist -Center back neck to waist -Front high point shoulder to waist (over bust) -Center front neck to waist -Bust apex from waist -Between bust apex points -Bust circumference (plus 1.5” ease) -Waist circumference (plus .5” ease) -Across shoulders (from the back) -Shoulder seam length (side of neck to shoulder seam) -Shoulder slope (parallel surface out from neck, measure up from shoulder seam)
I think if you said what the measurements were as your drawing them I could follow a little better. I'm not understanding one and a quarter. One and a quarter of what?????
This is a fantastic tutorial! Thank you for sharing your expertise! This was such an in depth but accessible video!!
Love your process! You can “cheat” all you want, as far as I’m concerned ~ Every little thing that helps draft well is Ok by me!
Have missed your fabulous tutorials ~ Back again in May 2024 to rewatch the old ones ( yes, they’re that good!)
Hello, could you upload a video on how to move the arm hole dart to the shoulder slope?
Just a heads up for others watching !! When drafting the shoulder length , move out /add .25 inches ..(your back shoulders are a little wider ) .. then proceed to the shoulder slope . He mentions subtracting .25 from the shoulder   during the second  part (front bodice drafting ) .. probably not a huge deal , but I'm a perfectionist 😅
Good ❤
Hi sir even if you're not making tutorial. Can you tell me how I can use this method to draft childrens basic bodice. Share some tips and advice so I can do it myself.
Wow
Hi Chris, thank you for sharing this, i have one little doubt. Why is that in the last 15 seconds of the video you do a tiny little adjustment to the side length? Why? I did not understand why you dont leave it straight? Well, thank you so much for this video 😊
How do we estimate the width of dart on armhole side?
Using a form is NOT cheating, it's excellent for tutorial purposes and in my mind the right way to film a tutorial.  However, I didn't find this method to be helpful due to the front bodice armhole. When I followed the directions to solve this, the bust dart roof ended up being over 3 inches wide and distorted the top part of the sloper. Even then, the front arm hole measurement still could not come close to the back armhole measurement. The paper had to be folded even more. The method just didn't work.
Sir recently came across to ur video wished I watched it earlier
Thank you, this is super easy to understand. 👌💕
Hi Christopher! How to sew the shoulder seams if the front is shorter then the back? Thank you so much!! I really appreciate it your tutorials!!!❤
I understand what's squaring up is but what does it mean to "True"?
Thank you so much. Moving the shoulder dart to the side was exactly the information I needed!
You are wrong!!! You must measure from model’s center back of neck, forward around neck, down the front bust and down to the waist, going over center of bust. That is the correct measurement!
Thank you so much sir! I need more your tutorials with basic block please. l want to be learning your tutorials.
Are you still downloading videos? I notice this are few years ago, and I will like to know if you going to continue to share what you do. Your method are very good and very well explained I love them. I’ll like to know the book that you actually use for pattern making. Excelente thank you much for sharing, it takes a humble person to be honest and share your knowledge thank you
this might be the only time in history that I've ever wished that I lived with another person so they could measure me. I would be happy to have you measure me on camera if you are in the San Francisco Bay Area.
Oh, you don't know how many of these I've had to watch. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
this video is kind of like the epitome of what the internet should be used for. Thank you so much, Mr. Sartorial! Very straight to the point and explained just enough to not confuse me as a novice!
Thank you! The  lesson is very  useful!!!
Christopher, you're a godsend. My bodice drafted from your method fits very nicely.  I have a question though... if the bust point is excessively low, how then should I measure the waist side seam. Thank you!
Before waisting my time and energy is this beginners friendly???????
Thank you so much Christopher! This was soo much fun putting this block together. I almost think I like drawing patterns better than sewing. It fit perfectly and I am an odd shape - shoulders are wide and arms are larger than most. I still can't believe how it worked. I made a woven top and still had room in the shoulders to move. I am excited to build many creations from this, It's great! Thanks again!
What if the waistline is equal to the bust?
it took me four trys,  converting your easurments to metric and then comparing my draft from your way to my previous sloper and yay , its spot on except for the arm holes which are personal choice anyway.  Excellent way of perfecting a sloper.  Now to go make a armhole template then  make up a muslin .  thankyou for taking the time to show us
Been looking for you. Thank you
I would love to see a video of you turning the sloper into a pattern please!
Please Christopher COME BACK pleaaaaase 😩😭😭😭
Thanks. It is so detailed and useful.
Thank you for this tutorial. I made this bodice in paper and it is fitted. How can I add more ease for a looser fitting top? Do you have a tutorial for adapting this fitted draft to a McCall's pattern?
Hi Chris, do you have an equivalent/differing procedure/methodology for menswear? Thanks.
Chris you have become  my new  friend, now, I must  work on the lapel jacket your way keep the good work 👏 🙌 👍
Thank you papa 😘 💖 💓 💗 ❤
Wooooow thank you daddy.so so helpful. We appreciate you soo much
Thank God!!!! Someone is not afraid to use the word "EASE."  My pattern drafts/blocks fail every time I follow very detailed instructors online -  except no mention of EASE.  The only time you do not need EASE, is when using knits and even in some cases you need EASE. I need to go out now, but when return I will sit with eyes trained on your video and watch your tutorial. Praise Jesus!!!
Hi good morning I need to see a draft where the sh to waist measurement is 3” longer than the back,when the back and the front is the same that is easy to draft
hi Christopher , you are great teacher , can you please make a video for basic bodice pattern , as with multiple videos not getting the right knowledge . I really  think you are the best .... thank you
Thank you so much for sharing this Professional video i can understand each step that you demonstrate looking forward to my first drafting i am sure i will succeed with your help many thanks.
Well explained, Excellent  explanation.   Very clear and precise.  Thank you for wonderful tutorial. I can not wait to see for the next  video.
I just subscribed.  This is the best video I’ve seen yet!  Thank you!
Hi Christopher, thank you so much for this tutorial. Very clear and straightforward. I'm wondering. Is there ease for ease of movement added already into these sloper instructions? or should we be adding this in? it seems like there is already ease added, but I can't figure out where in the steps that is.  Thanks again!
Thank you so much for this ! I really appreciate it ! Ive been out of school for so long I wanted a refresher without going back and this was VERY helpful ! Very Much appreciated
I would love to have the book
Thanks for the video. How can you tell that there will be extra fabric and bubble at the armhole? Thanks
Please add more videos
What brand is the French curve you use?
Where can I buy the mannequin that you are using? You are a great teacher  Thanks from Montreal
Please why aren't you loading more videos?
Sir, I’m super impressed by this video.it’s so precise and concise. I’ve searched YouTube, trying to find one I could easily relate to. I think you should release your pattern book!
Hi do you have a video on how to move the armhole dart
You are definitely a God sent! I stumbled across your tutorial after jumping through hoops with many other confusing tutorials. I am so used to draping my patterns I was in such disbelief after finishing both front and back under your directions. There are no words to describe the genius that you are! Thank you for making a seemingly difficult task so easy🙏
Wow wow wow  Just found you here and can I just say…. I used this tutorial and made a block for myself today. Fit immediately. IMMEDIATELY!!!  This is so valuable and you’re so gracious to give this information to us. Thank you and I look forward to following your other tutorials. 😍😍
نرجو منكم الترجمه الى اللغه العربيه
Es una pena q no pueda seguir sus videos, lis cuáles me parecen interesantes. Pero no hablo inglés. Di pudiera poner las medidas, subtitular. Sería muy agradecido
Thank you soo much Sir..👍🏼kindly,  can you do pattern drafting for kids also?🙈
I'm wondering why the bottom of the bodice is slanted or does it just look that way from the picture?
Anyone wanna explain... how he knew there was going to be extra material at the bust line? Consideing he took exact measurements then added ease? Much less to make an inch total dart at that area?  Since he gave 1.5 inches of ease is this why the dart was 1 inch?  I hear in the video he made a lot of tips from experience.... how did he know to bring in the meadurement 1/4 inch? Why not 1/2 or another measurement? Is this a standard garment measurement? I feel this was sooooo incomplete.
Wonderfull. Love it. What about sleeveless body, jacket, overcoat (ease)? Do not stop, i,t is too good, so clear. Thank you for doing it, Francine.
Can I use this video for a men’s bodice?
Can I use this video for a men’s bodice?
😢 can't understand yet. I wached more times
Hi Christopher  Could you explain after making a woven  bodice. Ok i have a shell of my garment so I can play to fit as I like.  But I don’t understand how to work after with my drafting bodice, let see on a existing pattern like ( simplicity etc) to make me fit on my size  How do we do that. Or how do we draft the bodice and let say I want to make just a simple shirt ou of it.? Where do I begin to sketch the ease and the line.  I’m sorry I really try to make my explaination so you will understand but I’m french and I have trouble to find my words.  Hope you will be able to help me. I would really like to make some garments and I have all my drafting bodice to my size that I have made but don’t know how to use it.  Thank you You are really a good teacher 🌹
Could I use this tutorial for a baby girl?
Amazing tutoriel! Thank you so much!
Please make more video tutorials. I’ve watched video, read blogs and a few books, but I’ve found your video is simple to follow and to the point. No dramas.
Big front neck n back neck how
How to join arm holes they are different back and front
Hi. Is there a book where you learned this? I’m trying to find a goof reference book.thank you.
Hi, thanks for this tutorial. I have a doubt, where you are talking about the dart at the waist line, you say that if the difference is more than 10" take 1 1/2" dart intake but in the measurements that you have taken the difference is 2.25". I'm not getting this pls help
Hello Christopher, I just saw your videos on the basic sloper though I've not tried them out, they seem incredibly easy to comprehend and I thank you for that but I have a few questions: you said the back armhole measured 9'' is the dart intake included in it and also most of the meesurements you used cannot be found in standard measurement chart, how can I draft the basic blocks following your guidelines Thanks again for the excellent tutorial
All very much appreciated, but why is there a 'bubble' of fabric that needs a dart at the armhole when you've used the body measurements? Baffled by that bit, though really enjoyed the depth and careful speed otherwise.
Appreciate his sharing how professionals do it, but I found it very difficult to follow.
Hi Christopher. Thank you very much
I cannot thank you enough for sharing your expertise and knowledge with us! I followed your guidelines for the fitted bodice sloper and I just now have the most perfectly fitting dresses! The fit is incredible! I could cry!  Thank you!
🌷🌷🌷🌷
Hi Chris, can this method be applied for young girls (12-13 years), who are just developing the bust? or shall consider less ease?  Please let me know, thanks!
I'm curious as to why your measuring 5" down from the top (I'm at 13 minutes into this), does it relate to anything else? I'm very concerned about this as I'm very short only 4'8", so saying a measurement like that for me is very different for even a petite that start at 5'2"
Hi...Im new to sewing...i was trying to use your method of drafting but encountered a problem...what do i do if the measurement at the waist line is almost the same as on the bust line ( the step at 8:06) it appears i have no excess for a dart...in measuring the person's bust and waist was almost equal to the bust ( person has a tummy but small bust)
Hi Chris! Thank you for the amazing video! If I may ask you a question, I noticed that when you true the darts on the waistline, it seem that you extended the side by about 1/4” on the side seams for the front and back bodice. Why is that? I noticed a lot of pattern books instructions as well, the side seams are always extended down by 1/4”- 3/8”. Is it for arm mobility? I hope this message finds you! Thank you for your time! Appreciate it!
I think I have a negative slope for the first 2 inches of my shoulder, and then half way across, it goes to a 2 inch slope lmao wtf
Christopher, you ROCK! amazing teacher <3
Hello, hopefully you still read these! I am a beginner pattern drafter and have had a couple of successes with dresses but my issue remains the bodice block. While I love your tutorials I still find problems in fit including the shoulder to bust area is baggy, the size and placement of darts makes the bust either tight on the side or loose underneath and the back of the bodice is always to wide between the shoulders. I have lots of fabric to make dresses and have trouble finding well fitting clothes in stores so any suggestions to fix these problems would be appreciated! Note: I live in Morocco, I can't go out and buy a pattern, they are simply not sold here.
Easy to understand. Other videos are complicated and they use cm mm it screws up for viewers esp beginners
Thank you so so much for the tutorial. Can you please do a tutorial for knit fabric? Thanks
Hi Christopher! Happy Thanksgiving! I am really thankful for your channel. Thank you! Looking forward for next year, hoping to learn pants lol
You make it look so easy
Hi Chris. Thank you for an excellent tutorial, as always. I am learning how to draft a bodice block in detail and your video ticks the box. Looking forward to many more video's that will increase my knowledge. Kind regards.
Dear Christopher. Thanks a lot for all these methods and great tutorials, it's a breeze of fresh air for my sewing projects - as I have been able to modify existing patterns with confidence. I have a question : Would you apply the same methodology for men fitted bodice? I am really wanting to apply this method to men, and though it could be easily translated.  Nevertheless, I am not sure if I should use the same standards while drafting the pattern.  Notably, would you : . Work with the same measurements (considering the apex to be also the fullest part of the bust)? . Add the same amount of ease - for bust and waist? . Subtract a 1/4inch to the bust and waist and back while drafting?  . Remove the extra length (about a 1/2inch ) of the sleeve with a dart?  Many thanks for your suggestions.
I really want to appreciate you for the back body pattern, I'm just few months and would like to see the front draft video, God bless you
Thank you for such an easy to follow tutorial. I have had the best success so far, but have you got any advice on why I have  gapping in the back neck bodice?
This is very simple to follow.  Good Job. What's about, how draft a woman pants. Thanks
This was so easy to follow! I was struggling with the patternmaking book I had from college to make my bodice and this was a lifesaver!
Hi, i appreciated your teaching style and the patternmaking method, but i would like to address an issue i faced that's hardly talked about. I tried to make a pattern for my petite body type (and have always failed on patternmaking instructions because of my bodytype) and the difference between bust and waist being around 4 inches and i think because of other measurements, it was impossible to add a dart, i already achieved the side seam shape that you acquired after adding the dart in the video. Could you please upload a video on patternmaking for athletic/petite/thin body types?
so easy to follow!!! thank yoouu!!
Is it okay if the middle section on mine is a bit narrower than your?
Thank you Chris! I've tried making the basic bodice many times with different tutorials. They were ok. And then I made the bodice with your instructions and it fits perfectly! The fine details made a difference. You have the best tutorial for the basic bodice, thank you! :D
Can you do a pant sloper
legend
I really like your tutorials. Anything planned for menswear?
Good day. First I want to say a great thank. You are professional to the core. However, you took 5" as the  halfback measurement.... Is the 5" standard? If not how then so your measure half back? Thanks for your quick response. I just subscribe!!!
Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!  I just discovered your fitted bodice sloper part 1 tutorial.  Your teaching skills are amazing!!!  This is the best I've seen.   Would you be willing to share with us how to draft a bodice sloper for men, pants for men and women, and anything you would like to teach us? Once again, thank you for sharing your expertise!
صح انا مافهمت ولا حرف لاكن انا واثق😁
Hello Christopher, the French Curve you have at 13:56, what is the technical name and brand for this? Do you know or have a link where I may buy one from please? I am having difficulty buying this exact one! I really need to. Thank you.
One more: My Bust is 9.8 and my waist is 9.4. So when i connect its not very sharp or angled. Do I still need to have a dart ? This is for the back
Also: My back length is 15 and the Center back length is 14.75 ..isnt that too small a difference to draw out the neckline ?
Hi Chris...At 7:16, wen u say one quarter of the bust : Does'Bust' include the ease that u have mentioned earlier?
Fantastic tutorial.  Thank you for sharing your knowledge.
Thank you  so much for sharing this. From Sri Lanka
Thank you, Chris!! This was not only mesmerizing to watch, it enabled me to draft a perfecly-fitted bodice and understand why it worked, whereas the previous one I tried did neither of those things. Thank you for sharing your expertise and experience.
I really enjoy your teaching style.  I hope you create more videos!
It’s awesome! Highly recommend that you watch it upside down. The camera angle gave a bit vertigo.
Hi again,Chris! My bodice turned out great. But  I'm wondering if I measured my shoulder seam length too long. The fabric comes past the shoulder.
thank you . Your instruction is greatly helpful. thank you
I can't thank you enough for these videos! I tried and failed drafting a sloper multiple times using more complicated instructions, but somehow this method fit me almost spot-on at first, and only took a few tweaks to get a perfect fit. Thank you so much. :)
hi chris generally waist dart is the difference between waist circumference and bust circumference in this case difference is 9 inch when divided by 4 it is 1 and quarter.am i right ? please explain thanks
Hi Chris, thank you so much for the tutorial.  At 7:53 on the video you square a line at the bottom for the waist.  The line that you draw looks like it is more than 90 degrees (it leans to the right).  How did you determine how far over to take the line?  I am not sure where I am meant to be positioning my ruler.  Many thanks.
Thank you, thank you, thank you!  I've been trying for 4 weeks now to make a sloper or dress block.  None talk about darts in the drafting, and I dont know how to add them.  Your's was the first, and only, video that I watched 1 time, followed the direction, and ended up with a useable piece.  I only needed to adjust the back dart another +.25in.  Again THANK YOU!
Plz sir do u have an online course for fashion design
Hello sir , thank for the precious informatiom you're sharing with us .  I have tired this method and it works amazing , but i have a slight problem , almost all the garments i made with this method , I end up with excess of fabric in the back , i tired to make the back darts a bit taller but it's not perfect yet , I'm thinking of making the front darts wider to swipe the the garment forward a little bit .  But I thought i get an advice from you , as you are a professional
Great video! Thank you! So thorough and easy to follow. :) Question: how do I increase the armholes? The fit is terrific everywhere else but the armholes are way too tight. :(
Can you please make a tutorial on how to draft male a and female trousers or pants
I really love this tutorial I am new to sewing I feel a little confused about the shoulder width,I have watched this video over and over and I have written everything  according to  the explanations and i stil can't find the shoulder width,is it the same as the shoulder seam length? im sorry ,i just need your help on this,and thanks so much for sharing your knowledge.
Thank you, thank you very much. It was quite a search. Your tutorial is not only patiently explained, but it also gives me insight how to adapt the measurements due to the pattern.
I had to watch this video twice in order to make sense out out if, but it would have been nice to include a picture of the final pattern at the start so beginners like me would have a point of reference.  Is the pattern as drawn for the seam, and I would have to allow extra for a 5/8-inch seam allowance?
Thank you very much! Your videos showed me the practical part of what I learned in my books
very helpfull....
If armhole is too small is it correct to drop it couple cm down? And then also add same length on the bottom?
Hello Chritophoes Thankyou for a great video i really enjoy it and i have followed it. I have a question in my front bodice around arm hole the measurement is 9in is that correct? And where can i start to do the dart? Thanks
Absolutely amazing!! Spent hours trying to make a bodice and messed up too many times to count because it was difficult to understand. Thank you so much yours was very easy and concise!! You are literally a life saver!!
You have no idea how your tutorial has helped me... Thank you!!!!
I wish every video on bodice making was like this. None of that A to B but don't tell us what or how they got A to B. Thank you so much!
I want to thank you so much for your videos.  I used your drafting videos to make a safari vest that fits so well it makes me smile to look at it.  But the most important thing is the confidence it has given me to sew.  The things I made before your videos were confusingly off and very discouraging.  Your videos have helped me progress in one of my favorite pastimes.  Thank you so much!
I have ended up with a lot of excess fabric at the top of the back in the neck area. How do I solve this? I also have excess fabric across the front above the bust across the chest.
I finally begin to hope being able to draft a well fitting sloper and eventujally a garment.  I just have one question...you dont mention adding ease here, so I assume that's done when adapting the sloper into a dress or blouse.  Do you have a chart or table of how much ease one adds ?  Thank you for this and I look forward to going through all your posts.
Very good and understandable tutorial.  There are some out there that are extremely complicated and impossible to understand (divide this by three, add a cm here etc - no explanation as to WHY which makes it impossible to alter later on), but yours works for me and is very comprehensible as to why you use which measurement where. That in turn enables me to make small changes if I need to. So thank you!
Thanks a lot u are the best 👍🏽
Hope you can make a video on making menswear sloper
Thanks, it was really helpful
I've drafted the back & front bodice and the back bodice wormhole measure 7 inches and the front bodice 9 inches. The back bodice seems smaller than the front. Is this how it suppose to be?
As a fashion designer and Tailor, I usually drape my patterns for designs in womens apparel. . In tailoring I direct draft.. I would like to know your views on suppression around the body.. As you know there are 3 main suppression points on the body : Back, side and front.. There are contention amongst some cutters which would take the most suppression. It cannot be divided equally between these points.. When draping  on a person I have found the body will dictate which points take the most suppression... On an average good quality dummy and a proportioned well balanced woman, I find the back to take out the most suppression as that Is  where our spine curves. Then next biggest suppression is side then front.. Of course there are variables in this as, if you have a big bust and small waist you would take a lot more suppression on front dart etc... Whats your views on the suppression points?
HI, I HAVE BEEN IN THE INDUSRTY FOR ALMOST 30 YEARS . IAM INDIAN AND THERE ARE FEW INDIAN GARMENTS WHICH CANNOT BE ACHIEVED WITH THE PATTERN THAT  I FOLLOW . I LIKES THE WAY YOU HAVE EXPLAINED . I WOULD LOVE TO CONNECT TO YOU . KINLDY LET ME KNOW HOW COULD I  COMMUNICATE WITH YOU READING FEW  ISSUES IN PATTERN MAKING
Hi Chris, I can't believe I'm just now recently finding your pattern drafting videos. You are definitely a professional and I appreciate your knowledge and skill. Thanks for sharing. Are you also an instructor, you do so, so well.
Chris please do you add the ease to all the measurements or only to the bust and waist...kinda confuse a bit???
Hello Mr. Sartorial, please about the back dart at the armhole area, is the meeting point of that dart in-line with the meeting point of the dart from the back to the waist   Thank you for this tutorial all the same. It’s been really helpful
Do fashion designers use maylines/parallel bars? I am architect student, this is my favorite drafting tool.
The best drafting bodice video so far. Thanks Christopher.
Oh Chris!!! Thanks for making this soooooo easy. I didn't see you measure across back. I did it anyway.  Great video...I look forward to more videos, especially pants draft.
Hi, Chris, great tutorial, I think I am ready to try drafting a pattern for my friend. Should she wear a light non-padded bra while I measure, since she is going to be wearing that under the finished garment or is the ease added, enough to accommodate? (Please excuse my English!)
What of the armhole depth?
I need more of your tutorials please...I’ve never had a better fit in my life...
Hi  I'm HappyDandong who runs sewing Channel. I got to know you by posting a recommendation videotaped . 😊😍
Thank you so very much for this. Very insightful. Very much appreciated. Will be trying to put this into practice soon...
A most excellent method and perfectly delivered, thank you. Could you please show us how to draft a bodice for knit garments?
Hi! I've tried several of your methods: the bodice sloper, skirt, and both the one and 2-piece sleeves. All of them worked really well! The really cool thing I find about your method is that it works effectively AND efficiently---- I've looked at a number of other methods before I sew yours, and they now seem unnecessarily complicated with either the measurements or the drafting. I'm really thankful you made these videos to share your knowledge with us! In the mean time, I DO wish you would make some more! Pants have always been a headache for me; I wonder if you would share your method on making pants :) . Also, attempting to make a bodice sloper for men, should I approach it the same way as with the women's sloper? Hope to hear back!
I’m goin out for paper to do this today. Thank you, finally it makes sense. Subscribed.
Wow, that was beautiful. Looking forward to part II now. Onwards!!...
Loved it!
It almost brings tears to my eyes watching this video. I have almost given up because of the complicated videos and instructions available for free viewing. Its insane some of the techniques I have viewed before yours. I can not thank you enough for presented this in layman's terms. I cant wait to draft my bodice.
I would just like to say that over the last few weeks I have tried drafting my own pattern, and have viewed and tried quite a few.  Yours is the easiest I have tried, and looking forward to trying your other patterns.
Thank you so much for this video. It was nothing short of amazingly presented. So concise and clear; something that makes sense, is logical and I can remember. I've also taken notes. I've never thoroughly understood the drafting before, although I did some 40 years ago, and the other sloper videos presented  are simply sloppy and confusing by comparison. I am very grateful to have found your videos.
Thank you for this video. Very detailed. You took your time to explain things and the reason for doing them.
Chris,   I have a client who is very big busted.   54 inch bust.   I am not really sure how to adjust the slooper pattern...
Thank you, Chris, for your concise, easily understood tutorials! Please keep adding more.
Christopher, today is 4/5/19. I've spent weeks up to today trying different bodice making tutorials and failed miserably until I found yours. Thanks for being patient and organized in your teaching method as well as in the measurement text. Next will be your front bodice tutorial. Again, thanks for taking the time to make this.
Hi chris u have a great tutorials. hope u will upload more about other related to garment tips and techniques.. thank u so much.
Thanks You 1
Hi Chris....Thnx again fr ur grt tutorial...When I measured my shoulder slope...It's coming 2 n half......'ll it cum ds much? Can i use ds method fr drafting my bodice? TIA
Thank you so much for these tutorials.  I have tried them and was happy with the result.  Just need to work on getting an accurate measurement for the slope (this was off so had to make an adjustment when sewing the garment) and had some issues with fitting the sleeve as well.   Can you do a pants block and a woman's shirt with a collar?  Thanks much.
Thank you for simplifying the drafting method.  It took me a minute to realize that you had the pattern sideways. :)  at the start of the marking lines. You didn't rush through and your soft voice made it easy to understand.  Again Thank You
Thank you. I know enough about pattern making to know I know nothing about pattern making. You make it look easy, best tutorial I've seen.
Thank you so much for this video! I was so confused before watching this as to the methodology behind certain measurements. You've explained everything so clearly that I'm actually able to firmly grasp the concept behind drafting a basic bodice and can work towards customizing beyond that. I wish you the best!
Hi Christopher love your videos. I would love if you could show us patterns for different neck designs
Hi Chris. I have been trying the fitted bodice drafting yesterday. The back bodice was no problem but when it comes to reduce the bulky in the front armhole, I found it hard.   Front Armhole=8 1/8" Back Armhole = 14" Which is a big difference.  I need some more explaining please.
What if the back bodice   was shorter ,how would you draft it and sew it  to the back bodice  to match it up perfectly  since the waist length would be different.Thank you.
Hi Chris I’ve got a question. What if the slope connecting the bust and the waist is not too steep, do I still need to add the dart? Also (if I still need the dart) what’s the minimum width for a dart? Thanks for the great video btw it’s really helpful and straight to the point! :)
Hi, I hope you can demonstrate how to make pants pattern next time. Thank you for the awesome video!
I love those tutorial they are awesome , can you tell me what size is manikin  the you using.
Does your method include the standard 5/8 seam allowance or does one need to add that?
the best demonstration of pattern making. Look forward to the pants sloper! Thank you so much ❤️
Ahh finally a perfect tutorial on how to create a bodice. Thanks for this! I love how everything is accurate.
Hello Christopher, please do you know how to manipulate the dart on the armhole in order to remove that when the fitting came very well ? because i don't want to have this on my dress style...
i was following for a while but i dont get this at all. i appreciate how much you tried but i just dont get whats going on
Thank you so much, finally a pro video on how to do it
Can someone explain me what is quarterback measurement?
Thank you so much for the video, so helpful to a beginner
What is called a apeck
Christopher,  I'm a beginner and been searching for the simplest bodice pattern for about a month now. This is really good and easy to follow.. Thanks for taking your time to explain step by step.
Will this work on a 10 year old girl? Thank you
Hi Chris thanks for the tutorial I have been trying to draft the basic bodice for a few weeks now without get the results am looking for.  I have watched all you videos and they are very simple and straight forward.  Am using software to create my patterns https://valentinaproject.bitbucket.io/  and I wanna try to make the patterns easier to resize for different measurements.  You mentioned that you place the across back line 5 inches below the high point shoulder can that be affected if back high point shoulder to waist is small? My question is can I use a formula or at least a ratio?
Hello again. is there some way i could get in touch with you. i am on facebook if that helps. i really really want you oppieon and advice on something and don't really want to put it here on the main page.  Thank you.
Thank you so much for sharing this. I've been following other tutorials on the basic bodice and still couldn't get a proper fitting even though I used my own measurements. I have no idea why I haven't found you before. Again, thank you very much!
Excellent video! Thank you!!
This I understand, and think it's possibly something I can do. Other videos have left me feeling very confused. Thank you.
Do you have this drafting bodice instructions written out in steps. Really difficult to follow and take notes. 😕
perfect fit for me .thank you so much
Hello. I found these tutorials extremely helpful and ended up making kind of a worksheet from these instructions. Is it ok if I make the worksheet available for download with credit to you? I made a chart of all of the measurements and used javascript to calculate the measurements and add them into the instructions at the steps they're required. I'm not sure if I'm explaining that clearly. I can link to screenshots if you'd like.
This is by far the best I've seen, thank you very much.
Hi yours is the best tutorial after all the research I've done. Is your method for a standard B cup? I did not see you measuring directly underneath the bust. How do you determine the cup size so that the bodice fits busty women as well? Thank you so much for sharing your secrets
Very precise an well tempered a voice one can record in memory thanks for sharing we appreciate your approach much
Why are you starting with the Back high shoulder to waist measurement & not the center back? Confused me.
Not sure if this has been covered below, but can I use the same information to draft a mens block (making the darts smaller of course)?  Could you do a video on menswear in the future?
Hi Chris I’ve made my sloper, for the shoulder width you’ve said to measure 5” down, which I’ve done.  However it seems tooo high.  I’m a big woman rtw size 22-24 .  Would I have to move the shoulder dart down slightly?
Love this tutorial!  I’ve made myself a duct tape body form to my measurements, will be measuring and drafting tommorrow.  I m sure it’s going to fit just fine.    So easy to follow your instructions. Thankyou
Thank you, thank you, thank you!
Hands down the BEST pattern making video on youtube, stitched this for myself and it came out perfect!!!!!! Fit me to the T! So glad I found this may God reward you for your kindness!
This has to be one of the best fitted bodice block tutorials that I have see on the internet , I really found your tutorial style clear to follow with great added information ….I will be watching all your tutorials ….will be making the blocks in a range of size in order to gain confidence in this method. This is how pattern cutting should to taught...im still learning a 62.Thank you .
hi Christopher, I have been drafting pattern for 16 years now but I didn't understand exactly how it worked until yesterday that I watched your. thanks  for the armholes and truing explanations.
I just took all my measurements last night so I could draft a sloper. Your dress form is almost exactly my size. 😂
Thank you very much. Now i have a better understanding of drafting patterns. Very explanatory and professional.
Wow, thank you for this!!
Plz Chris can I get a back sloper video for a blz
You are doing a great work keep it up
Hi, I have so enjoyed the videos that you have made available. Your detailed explanations have made the whole process very easy to follow. Many thanks for taking the time and effort to share your knowledge with others who are not as talented.  I have two slight problems and would be so grateful if you could advise me. Both concern the dart at the back armhole. Firstly, I am not sure whether to include the dart when I measure round the armhole (to determine how much I will need to remove at the front armhole). Do I measure the whole armhole or do I omit the half inch? Secondly, I have one shoulder that is an inch lower than the other. If I follow the rule and square a line 5" below the Back high shoulder point, one dart will be 1" lower than the other. What should I do?  Many thanks again and I look forward to having clothes that will now fit!
pls  this bodice sloper is very nice and accurate I try and it work very nice .Pls can u help as the drafting of a men's shirt
Perhaps someone could give me a tip on how to deal with this? I have 'ye olde spare tire which throws off the typical draft proportions. Because my waist isn't smaller than my under bust, I can't seem to get the formula to work for me. Does anyone else have this issue or know how to fix it? I suppose I could always dissect a current garment to create my sloper but it feels like cheating, lol.  *Note: I haven't tried this method, so it's possible that my issue was caused by my previous method.
its worth watching. thanks
thank you for sharing your experience and knowledge
Hi Chris, thank you for this ! What of seam allowance ? where do I add that ?
Hello sir, I found the best bodies draft making techniques from your video tutorial.Its give me a clear vision on baaic bodies draft.plotting the dart, it's give a perfect shape.if I don't plot the dart,what will be problem I can face?If it is not in my pattern,then ,what will be the measurements?If I want a dartless bodice draft,what will be the the techniques?I am waiting for your reply.
Have just found your channel, wow such concise uncomplicated instructions with many useful tips. Thank you so much. So very helpful
Wow the best tutorial on bodice pattern.... And chris i would love one on pencil skirts thanks
Hello you added allowance ease for only waist and bust. How come none for  All other areas e.g sewing at shoulder.
Is it a stretchy fabric that you put on a dress form
This is the first time i come across your channel . i took courses before but no one teaches you anything and its all commercial here so  have been trying to self study pattern making for awhile now and i failed alot to understand . also i watched many youtube videos and it was very complicated . This is the First video I watch in your channel , i didnt try it yet but  you say all the information clearly and easy . i just have troubles from inches to cm . thank you really , you are very helpful and a wonderful teacher , please keep making those videos.
Christopher, today is 4/6/18. I've spent all week up to today trying different bodice making tutorials and failed miserably until I found yours. Thanks for being patient and organized in your teaching method as well as in the measurement text. Next will be your front bodice tutorial. Again, thanks for taking the time to make this.
Thank you this helpful tutorial! Do you buy chance have an instructional pdf form for this tutorial? Thank you :D!
Hello sir.. thank you for your videos, can you please let me know that why did you drew the back arm hole curve in 2 separate curves by moving the French curve instead of making it a single curve by connecting all the points. Thank you
Chris, How can i calculate the amount lf fabric needed for a project. Im 40-30-42. I want to make a pemplum top but the tail to the floor. If the fabric is 45" wide how much is needed. If 54" or 60" how much is needed? Thanks
Chris, Do you have a tutorial for draft notch collar and lapel?
As I've said before this tutorial is the best. But I'm unable to get the shoulder slope properly. I don't know what I'm doing wrong but I always seem to be a half or so inch out. Is there another way to measure the shoulder slope. Or can you demonstrate from behind the form to show me? Sorry if I sound silly I'm just starting out
i looked for that particular shape french ruler and couldnt find it. so i hope what i have coming will be ok.
Hi Chris your method is good but I would love to see you do a basic bodice where the back length is shorter than the front thank you may God bless you
OOOH I love this tutorial! Ditto what everyone is saying here. It's fantastic. I'm  drafting a bodice sloper now, while studying this tutorial. Thank you so much for creating this video. Where else can I see more of your work? I see your videos here on your channel, (I'm subscribed) but do you have a website or blog? Or another way to learn from you, perhaps?
Can u tech custom made mens suits profational master tailor
When drafting for a rather busty model with a tiny waist, is it best to take 1/2 the back bust or still use 1/4 of the full bust circumference? Wouldn't that bring the side seams up onto the sides of her chest?  Thank you for your video!
Thanks for posting this video, have a question. I am trying to get a nice fit for Indian saree blouse, saree blouse has a deep front and back necks, what changes to make to the bodice  , shoulder slope and armhole measurements
Thank you so much, Christopher for your straightforward and informative instructions.  There are a lot of poorly communicated, vague, error-filled bodice sloper instructions on the Internet and I have just wasted a week attempting to make a sloper based on some those versions.  Thanks to you, I now have a sloper I can actually use.  Your videos will be my go-to default from now on.  Happy New Year from New Zealand :-)
You are the best. I need all the help I can get.  Can you give help for measuring a round back and/or mature figure?  You gave me the help for sloped shoulders and waist to hip connections that I was never able to find before and I understand .           Your tutorials are great.  I need all the help I can get but I never expected to get the quality of your knowledge and teaching skills.  So happy you spend time to explain each step that builds on the next.   Thanks for a basic balanced presentation without a background of flash and noise. Hopefully more people will find your channel.    I can watch again and always find more info.  I read all the comments and your replies. Please continue to make more videos on your YouTube channel.
just watched this a few minutes ago and wil be making a dress for my mom tonight. fingers crossed but she doesnt have a perfect body... very dispoportionate so tomoro morning is gonna be a bomb... might be a hit or myght be a fail but whicheva way its gona be a bomb. wish me luck lol
Hi Chris, i find your tutorial very helpful and highly simplified, easy to follow and still giving a bodice block that fits properly. I would like to ask if I can move up my side seam, that is, below the armpit.i feel the armhole has too much depth, the distance from the armpit to the beginning of the side seam is about 1.5" which I find rather too low. I look forward to your response. Thanks.
YOUR TUTORIAL IS THE MOST INFORMATIVE OF THE 6-10 TUTORIALS I'VE WATCHED FOR CONSTRUCTING MY OWN GARMENT PATTERNS...THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH!!!
Firstly, THANK YOU so much for all your wonderful pattern drafting tutorials. I drafted the fitted bodice sloper and sleeve for myself and it's perfect. The most challenging thing is measuring your body alone.   I have a question that I believe has not been addressed. When using the slopers to draft a garment pattern, I would like a little more ease. Would I just add it to the bust, waist and hips? I'd also like a little more ease in the armhole but don't want to throw off the shoulder which fits so nicely. How would one go about doing that? Also, if you DO change the armhole, would you have to draft an ex novo sleeve pattern or is there some way of adding ease to the sleeve sloper ? I hope I've explained myself.  Thanks again and looking forward to more videos!
Thank you for the clear and  detailed explanation. I have drafted my  back and front bodice pattern but my back  armhole seam to be smaller than my front armhole. I have followed all the steps. Please can you explained. Thank you.
I agree with @Wenz To ive watched ALOT of these trying to get proper instruction and this has to be the best on out on the interwebs! thank you for the effort of recording and being so clear!
Hi Chris. How did you take 5" down from High Point Shoulder to Across Back? You didn't measured while taking measurements. Please help me out!  Please !! Will be waiting :)
Hey Chris, my first attempt at drafting the back bodice and I think it went well until the armhole.   I have a french curve but I'm a beginner at using it.  How will I know when the curve is right?  With my larger size overall bodice is there any way to calculate how large the armhole should be?  You made a dart in the armscye to shorten the length of the armhole, assuming I will have to do the same how will I know how much?  The armscye always, always ends up throwing me off.  I'd appreciate any feedback you can give me.  Thank you very much.
Hi Christopher.. Am so thankful I found you. You are a really great teacher. Can't wait for more videos. Thank you so much. God bless you
Thank you Christopher Sartorial!!! I began to sew 40 years ago. I made my clothes with the help of magazines patterns like Burda but with the age my body changed, magazines don't and I almost quit doing them. I've decided to make fitted clothes. After 2 months, hundreds of measurements in cm, inches, whatever.. 6 Bodice sloper drafting (one learn from a French Couture book, one from an American e.book and 4 from Brazilian YouTube tutorials), It was difficult to swallow that the  problem was in me, that I had "abnormal"  measures... fortunately, I'm as normal as woman can be :). In one week I've already made a tunic, a collar shirt and a dress and I'm going to do more. I'm looking forward to more videos. Thank you very much for sharing your knowledge.
Thanks Chris for the video. Can this same drafting be used for children as well?
Thank you so much for this tutorial.  I've been working myself back up to Fashion Design and I've watched a lot of tutorials on the basics but yours is by far the best one I've come across.  It's clear and concise and precise, not like a lot of other ones that add too much fluff at the beginning and too much mannerisms that are distracting.  So, once again I Thank you.
Hello Christopher, thankyou for this tutorial series, I'm trying yr method out now, not having had much luck with all the books/ normal methods. What is the brand name or type of French curve you use here pls? I've searched all the usual online places and haven't found this particular shaped one.
Hello Chris. Thank you for this wonderful video. I'm just a little confused on why you started from the back high point shoulder and not Center back to start your draft????
This is the best and most clear set of drafting instructions I have ever seen. PLEASE keep them coming. I am a beginner to sewing clothes and these have been invaluable to me!
Thanks a million!!! I've been looking for a bodice pattern that fits without much adjusting for a long time. Perfect. Anxiously awaiting the pants draft.
thanks a lot this is very helpful
most helpful thank you
The best most simple tutorial I've seen. Thank you. I can't wait to create my perfect bodice sloped. Can't wait to see more.
Hi Chris, if i don't want my blouse to be too loose, what ease is advisable for bust and waist (is it 1 1/2 and 1/2 respectively, as per in the video ok?) Thanks, and hope i am not being a nuisance
You were right...yours is the best video...specially with the dart ...thank you
thank u for d video, pls how do i blend d back bodice to d front bodice since d back of my bodice is shorter in lenght than the front
Excellent, keep the videos coming
Hi Chris, what happens in a situation where the back and front high point shoulder to waist   differs? do we extent the front bodice by the difference from bust line up or down?
Excellent video on drafting a bodice I've ever seen. Ive been looking for something like this!Thank you so so much and God bless you
Why did you draft a bust line for the back bodice? I don't get it.
Sloper not slipper
Thank you so much. Very clear. When I use commercial patterns I always have to do a narrow back adjustment. Would I still need to do this on the slipper?
The across back 5 inches, how was that calculated? what if we draw a pattern for small kids, is it still 5? My other question, the seam allowance we add to these finished patterns is it all around
the most professional,the easiest and the clearest vedio I've ever seen for the bodice sloper  could you please make it in a written version?! by the way , excuse my english sir but I feel that I have to thank u
This is the best i ve seen so far!  Tnx soo much!
are you able to do a tutorial on mens shirt pattern making
Hi Chris, I'm a beginner at drafting patterns. I don't understand the measurement you took after marking "Burst Apex to waist". Pls can you kindly explain.Thanks
i will use your techniques from now on..sir, can you please give me the standard measurements which you use?
By far the best explanations i have found on on slopers...you are extremely knowledgeable. Thank you for the videos!
The best I have ever seen so far 👏👏👏 thank you 😊
VERY NICE! SIMILAR RESULT THAN WHAT YOU GET USING THE ""MASTER RULER" YOUR EXPLENATION IS VERY CONVINCING.
The best and most professional video on drafting a bodice so far, looking forward to more great stuff, thanks!
This is an excellent video. Thank you.  Could you please make another video about simple pencil dress or trousers pretty please 😍😍😍
i am so happy I saw this video...very simple and understandable..with those complicated tutorial you get crazy with this I feel like I found redemption...haha
Excellent video. Can you please teach making a pant .
I have done and redone the bodice draft but none fit as perfectly as yours the first time.  Your method for making the armhole smaller was right on point. I want to thank you for making simple the drafting of the bodice.  I am looking forward to drafting the women's pants.
Hello Chris. Thank you for taking the time to put out this video. It is clearer than , so far, all the pattern drafting videos i found on YouTube.  My question and request to you is, can you please help me with proper measuring and drafting of the bodice for men and maybe even one for pants. I am really wanting to start making my own clothes and have been searching for a long while for help.  I hope you can help me . Please let me know. Thanks
super explain thank you sir
One of  The best videos. But. Question if I am using a stretch fabric should u make the dart on the paper than trace around the pattern leaving it out?
Thanks for the Really clear and informative tutorial. Can you  tell me what make your dress form is please?
This is a really nice tutorial, but I have read in a few other places that the armhole depth is an important measurement and you don't take or use that measurement. Do you not think it is necessary?
THANK YOU MR. CHRISTOPHER.
Hi Christopher, sorry about my comment, I found the information at the beginning of your 1st video.  Thank you again for your video.
I just finish drafting the back and the front bodice slopper, how and where to I add ease.  Thank you for your answer.
