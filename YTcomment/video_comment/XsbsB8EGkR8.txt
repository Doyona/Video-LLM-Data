i only had a 15cm zipper on hand so i made up a tiny prototype and its SOOO CUUUUTE
Very clear tutorial, I will make one now thank you new subscriber
Easiest simple video ever! Thank you!!
What do we do about the raw edges inside, though? It doesn't really look great inside!
Thankyou for clear instructions
I thought something was off about this tutorial, I then later realised that all of the seams will be exposed on the inside of the bag. Don't follow this tutorial there's much better methods where you don't have to go about the faff of putting binding on the raw seams !!
What is the best fabric to use?
❤❤❤well explained thank you
Loved ❤️ the Tutorial it was  Spot On!!! GREAT JOB!! THANK YOU 😊
Simple nice
Very nice video I just finish it 👍
What do u do with all the raw edges
Thank you. I saw this yesterday and made today. I was looking for accessories for a handbag I'd made and this fits In perfectly 😊
Thank you for your tutorial. I will make mine soon.
Thank you for an easy tutorial
How can I hide the inside seam?
❤thank you for this video. I am going to go home and try it now.
Thank you for the nice tutorial!
Came across this by accident. Great concise instructions. I’ve already made 5 for Xmas presents! Thank you.
Best video
This is cute basic bag, but it shows the raw edges inside that you don't get to see that in the end clip which it doesn't give a finished look.
thank you this tutorial is helping me to start my own business!
Thank you so much 🥰
Love it easy quick design
Thank you... This is nice video

What fabric did you use?
What material is best to make this? Thank you. Fab tutorial ☺️
I'd put binding over the raw edges for the last few seams otherwise they are visible inside which isn't shown in the final photo. It will look much neater. Other patterns/tutorials hide the edges but are a little more complicated.
Thanks a lot, so good and clear learning
Anyone in 2020??
What type of fabric
This tutorial is exceptional. It’s my go to whenever I need to put a sandwich zipper into anything. Concise and clear instructions, easy to follow along with and the pouch is adorable. My only suggestion would be to use interfacing on the exterior fabric to give the pouch more of a structured shape. I’ve done it both ways and personally prefer it with interfacing... anyway, thank you for sharing this lovely project with us.
Is this is a cloth made one? Am so confused..anyone please clear..also thought if it has a loop we could easily carry as it meant for cosmetics pouch
I must have done something wrong as on the inside you could see all the stitches in the lining etc and it looked awful...
Nice
Fantastic tutorial, creates such a professional-looking little bag! Thank you for sharing this :)
Tutorials for box style cosmetic bag
I absolutely love this bag and your tutorial made it so easy.  Your instructions are so clear and easy to follow.  Thank you.  From Ann.  Sunshine Coast Qld.
Measurements pls
Last time i am confused 🤔
Thanks
That was awsome ...
السلام عليكم merci pour votre vidéo très belles 🇩🇿👍
Fabric used???
Great tutorial
Love this bag, I’m a beginner and with your tutorial I made it in a few hours, thank you, can I post a pic of the finished product?
im not 100% how you fold to make the corners. I wish the fabric wasnt brought off camera during this fold.
I am following this rn! And you sound exactly like belle from once upon a time, my all time favorite show!!!!!!
Are the seams inclosed?
how many cm cloth make them it mam👝
This is cool but the inner stitching (triangles) is seen when we open it....so how to get rid of That
just a question, is there a reason you do no only use 2 larger pieces of material instead of 4? would that not eliminate the bottom/interior seam?
Super
Sooo cute, but why I can see the sew in the innerlining... ???
Nice
Hmmm I am not satisfied inside my bag in the bottom. You can see the sewings. What did I do wrong?
Nice
Very nice
OH OH
Wow
I was so disapointed when i realize the seem was visible inside... Why not show it in your video So people dont make this mistake if they dont want visible seems
If the zip is 18 cm what size should be??? 18by what???
This is a good tutorial but the bag is tiny! I'd also love to have a tutorial to make this without the seams visible on the inside. It would look much neater.
I just love this tutorial, thanks for posting! I've made lots of these of various sizes, and while mine are a lot flatter than yours, they work really well for plane travel. I've given many to family who have been travelling and I like to keep my headphones, eye patch and medication etc in mine. :)
I like it bag
Wow, keep it up 👆
L
Completed this project, but didn’t realize the inside would show raw edges- not a good look - looks unprofessional... Also, I would recommend if you make this to interface the main fabric because the end result will be flimsy and will not hold its shape..
Plz make more videos
What is the name of the fabric pls reply
For commercial production, what type of textile machinery would you consider is needed to produce this type if bag in a factory?
Superb
Very nice mam

Hi.  I struggle with metric since I am in the USA where we do not use it as a general rule.  is there any way you can add inches where you not metric information?   I did the best i could with those tiny little measurements on my ruler, but inches would be so much easier.   Thank you .

Ive learnt lots new things .you explain and show how to do do things very well.esp.for a learner like myself who has no confidence in sewing  i like to make things for charity to help raise money so looking forward to any new sewing items coming ..thankyou keep up.the fab work...its greatly appreciated.x
I love it
awsome thank you
It looks so pretty , my mother is going to make for me and also when we have some types of other pencil cases it makes a lot of sound but when we make or buy pouches it doesn't make much sound and I think my mother have all the things to make one pouch.
I guess I can convert the measurements in inches.  It would help if you could give us both measurements cm and inches Please!
great demo, I understand you perfectly so the english native below is the one with problems. I must say the music doesn't help and it makes it hard to hear what you are saying. So please no music in next video. But thank you so much for sharing what you do with a video, it is greatly appreciated.
Wooow that's nice
Hey, my zipper is just 12 cm long. How are the other lengths then and how long is the edge for making the boxy look? :) hope smb respond

How cut & stitch purse with many zip pockets
Wow, it looks store bought. Awesome work. Thanks for sharing.  :D
Great explanation, seems easy enough!
Good morning, Thank you for your response.  I will do that.  Have a Happy July 4th:)
Greetings StyleNovice, I would like to know if I take the inner pieces of the bag and stitch them together, then the outter pieces and do the same would I still be able to make the box bottom? or do you have any suggestions.  I am trying to get a seamless lining.
I know this video was posted a while ago, but I want to know the dimensions of the finished pouch
I enjoyed this video! DW
You oughtta make one with interfacing and an invisible zipper
good job!!
Beautifull, thank you for tutorial!!!
I just finished mine! Your video is so helpful and easy to follow! I made mine out of leftover material such a cute tutorial! :)
Hi everyone, a lot of you have been commenting that you want to make a bag with hidden seams. Well, now you can! Check out my SECOND DIY Make-Up Bag - Follow the link in the description box now :)
Well done!
Hey stylenovice! I just finished making your bag and have a question for you. The seams inside the bag are not hidden (instead they are exposed). Is it supposed to be like that or did I miss a step? :( Thank you so much, it's a very cute bag! X
I'm new to sewing. I hope I can do this...  :)
So beautiful :) I will do this, thanks a lot :)
Very nice and easy, thankyou .
Super.i like this thankz a lot
is it me hearing wrong or they changed the orthograph of zip to zeup?
love your tutorial. I have made one but the seams are showing in the inside. Is there any way to hide the raw seams.  Thanks
i made two today! one small, one big!  your video  was very helpful! thanksssss!!!
Looks great! Loving the pretty material you chose for this tutorial, and the tutorial itself!
I just made one. I only had 7 inch zippers in my stash so I made a much smaller bag about 1 1/4" tall by 6"long by 3 1/2" wide when finished. Thanks for the great video.
This video is awesome! I have been wanting to sew a make up bag like this for a long time, but had no idea how. I am going to go cut my fabric out and start immediately :)
I can't believe how easy it is to make this beautiful bag !! Thankyou so much for this wonderful video !! :))
Love the way you did the zipper install! So much easier than hand sewing the lining in.
Great work n fabric is amazing.
U rock.......I really luv it......awsmmmm!!!
I tried this and it worked really well x very good video with easy explanation x
can the bottom get box shape too?
you have such a lovely way of explaining! Thank you for this tutorial! It is now on my to-do list!

Great video and seems pretty easy to do.Do you think it will be okay without an interior fabric?Provided that the exterior won't be a very thin one..
nice thx love this idea
i just loved making this pouch what a great video and excellent command over your teaching. loved making it and i guess i am going to make alot of them and give as a gift during my summer vacation to my family. i wanted to ask you if i want to put a piece of my batting as in quilting and do the quilting what are the steps i shuld follow and another question is if i want to make a bigger size than this what are the measurements. excellent !!!!!
WOW! I will have to do this this soon.
I could listen to you teach all day long, love your accent and your project!!
This is really simple and gives me a wonderful use for my Halloween fabric since I wanted to make something really cool with it. Thank you for sharing!
I love this and would love to give it a try but is there a way to do this without the stitching showing on the inside?

when you say sew each of the four corners (referring to making it box shaped) it look like you just sewed across the drawn line, is that right or did i miss something or? idk im confused omg
At 1:45 you say to place the second interior piece face down, is that correct? I didn't see any text box pop up to tell me otherwise, so I did that and it came out wrong...
That was SO easy. Thank u
I like the design of the fabric you use
Thank you ! Super video !!!
Very nice! thanks!
You make these tutorials so easy to understand! And your voice is perfectly clear! I'm gonna do some make un bags with chips bags :D
جممممميل جدا
Cool
Thank you SO much for such a thorough, easy to follow tutorial! I just subscribed and cannot wait to make this! :)
Ur so amazing
What type of fabric is this?tia
How do you get rid of the extra fabric on the inside? Because I have little flaps of fabric from the last step to make it more boxy
Thank you soooo much :)
Woooow sooooo cool ❤️❤️❤️
Where did you get that rose/floral fabric? Its so cute.
Thank you:) appreciate the video tips

AMAZED at the amount of views this video is getting. So many of you have shared that you have been making lots of these bags.... where are the pics!? I would LOVE to see your creations! x
This is so easy.i has made 2 al ready.
What do you do with the ugly seam allowance that's inside the bag? This should be hidden between the layers.
i just finished making one and would send you a photo soon. thanks for removing time to teach it so easy.
how would this pattern work with faux leather???
so love this.  Making 3, one a little larger and one a little smaller makes a nice gift set (at the store a set like this can cost $20 (US) for more!   I have seen these bags made before but your technique makes it sooooo easy. Thank you !
Thanks for watching Siva :)
Very nice...
Woo! Thanks x
The last part confused me cx
Great easy to follow tutorial!
You're welcome :)
Thanks Raza! Thanks for watching x
Very nice!
I could not find the tutorial for this bag on your blog :(
It has raw edges on the inside yes. My 'Bow Clutch' tutorial is one that shows you how to do a hidden seam bag :) Thanks for watching x
Does this method leave raw edges ?
Thanks Karen x
good video x
Im going to try this soon as i get my sewing machine i order online, Thanks for the video
You should! Send me a pic of how it turns out :)
That is so cool! I want to try this now!
2.54cm = 1 inch. If someone you know has a clothing measuring tape, it should have inches on it and makes things a lot easier :) Thanks for watching x
How many centimeters are there in a inch ?
Thanks for watching! Hope you give it a try :)
Oh wow, thank you. Will have to try that!
Yep, it mentions leaving the zip half open. This is enough to turn it out the right way :) Thanks for watching x
Thank you!
Btw awesome video I love it❤️
She used the zipper
I wonder.. in the tutorial you didnt mention the opening to rurn the bag inside-out. how did you do that when you've sewn all sides together?
Hi StyleNovice. Just wanted to help you out w/ a tip. I made this bag. Great video. Thanks! But instead of using straight pins to hold the zipper down, I used a regular childs Elmers glue stick along the very top edge of the fabric. It holds the zipper in place long enough to get it to the sewing machine! And then you don't have to deal with all of the pins! Hope you can use this tip! Ty again for the great video!
Thanks for sharing!
Aw, thanks Louise. So glad you enjoyed it. Thanks for watching x
OMG this is AMAAAAZING!!! I LOVE YOU!!!! whenever I am board I seek your channel for quick and easy projects!!!
You're AWESOME ! TEACH ME MORE
Thank you Amruta! Thanks for watching x
amazing !
Hi Lola, of course not. DIY is all about what suits YOU :) The inner layer does give it an extra stiffness to help keep it's shape and does help, if something spills inside your bag to stop it seeping through to your outer layer but use what you have! It will still look great. Also, it doesn't have hidden seams so its not like it would look any different on the inside :) Thanks for watching x
I love this DIY but Iwas just wondering: is it necessary to use interior fabric?  Thank you x
New Zealand :)
where are you from?
how fabulous was that!! You made it look so easy. Will definately try this bag
You're welcome :) Thanks for watching x
waw very nice, thanks a lot!
Hi Elena, this particular project does require a sewing machine. The weight of the zip and products inside once full would be too much on hemming tape etc. Have a look at my DIY Fashion playlist, there are some great scarves that are 'sew-free' :) Thanks for watching x
.You make them so unique i love it! What if I don't have a sewing machine?????
Aw, that's fantastic! You'll be a better sewer than me in no time! ha ha
Thank you Jeanette. Thanks for watching. Hope yours turns out well :)
Yay, that's fantastic. I love to hear when people gave my DIYs a go!
You provided the most thorough instructions and my bag came out perfect. Thanks for posting.

You made my day :) That's exactly what these videos are for. You don't have to spend a lot to look fab and have nice things! Thanks for watching x

Aw, thanks Debra! I think it's the contrast zip that really makes it pop! Thanks for watching x
