Hi! How much cocoa powder should I add if I want to make chocolate cake? Thanks! Love your videos! ❤❤❤
can i skip eggs? and what difference does it make in mixing egg whites separately then mixing the yolks and whites together?
Making this recipe as we speak. The batter is very airy and light. I’m baking cupcakes with this batter. So far the cupcakes are shrinking a bit. I’m going to bake them for 16-18 minutes on 350 degrees. I’m dying to taste it and see the texture. I tasted the batter and I loved the taste.
New subscriber here,  thank you for sharing your knowledge...i will surely try this...

tried it again  and failed it utterly i did the mini version that you had this time and nope still failed idk what im doing wrong.. but this is dissapointing for me sigh.
@BakeLikeAPro i made this recipe on a 10 inch pan and it deflated , what did i do wrong?  i may have an idea of what i did wrong, when i was going to add the flour into the mixture, the flour went right in the bottom so i was like oh crap this is gonna be hard to mix in, which it was but i think i did mixed it all good enough, in the end well 15 min after or so it begun to shrink and pretty much the center of the mixture went right in, maybe you can give me an idea of what could i do to prevent this, could i just use the paddle attachment for the flour mixing istead of using the spatula? also i didnt do the banging on the container.
how long i beat the eggs if i use hand not mixer?
sir Why didn't u add any butter to this recipe and if I want to add butter will it make any difference? plz tell me

Can you tell me what is wrong when the cake sinks while still baking? Thermometer inside oven said 350. Eggs looked ribbon like in bowl and pale, did I over beat? Batter seemed to look as shown,  it was rising nice looking while baking but looked as if it was browning too quickly, I went to check to see if it was done since it was getting brown and it sank in the oven. I left it to finish baking it wasn't done and it came out sticky dense and crumbly like. Suggestions?
Can you make them as cupcakes

Hi can I use microwave for cooking the sponge cake. Thanks :)
Thanks so much for this recipe it really helps me...
Hi there. Thanks for the recipe. I tried making this today, but i don't have a mixer machine. So i tried my very best in order to get the batter to rise, by whisking vigorously by hand, for like 20 mins. It tired me out, but i don't think it did rise as much as required.   The cake deflated, and the insides weren't spongey at all, but like a well cooked sweet omelette. Is this something that happens when the batter isn't whipped well enough?   I've learnt a lesson here, and i've gone to Amazon and ordered one of those hand mixers. Hoping to make great cakes soon. Thank you for your post once again!
Is this what is called a Genoise cake? I really do want to try this. I am so taken with baking; biscuits,  cookies, bread and so on!   Can you tell me what size your cake tin is please? At present I only have a 24cm springform tin.
Why didn't you use butter, is butter compulsory?
I really wanna try this out! Great job!
What type of oven do you used...convection or conventional oven. I am new to baking so please help.
socheata tin I used all purpose flour.  In some countries this is called "plain flour"  I hope this helps and thanks for watching :-)

Hello we should not use baking powder
I woundr r if i can make this in my easy bake 😞
Hi   As I use a 6inch pan I reduced the ingredients but followed exactly as u did with my iPad on... But the cake although fluffy and tasty but it just became flat.. It dint rise as it should.  I used... 5 eggs(small) ..half cup sugar..1cup all purpose flour , 1 tbsp vanilla and pinch of salt.. I whipped the egg with sugar till it was fluff.y and light... And then added the flour mixture and folded it... Once I put it in the pan... I could see some flour lumps at the bottom of the bowl...   I don't know if that is wat went wrong or the time I took for whipping or something else.. I whipped for 10-12 mins.. Till I got the creamy mixture.   Can you please tell me what went wrong?? Please..

My oven cooks a little hot so it's browner than I wanted, tell my daughter to turn it down and she turns it up.  I happened to find my 10-inch spring form pan which was perfect, no overflow.  I would not try to make this cake with a hand mixer.  My Kitchenaid got the volume you got (5 min w/o sugar, 5 min with).  I followed the instructions exactly but will add a caution.  I did sift the 1 cup of flour over the batter.  It will sink to the bottom as you start folding so go deep all around and in the center when you are folding.  I folded and folded, never  stirred, and just when I think it's mixed, more globs of flour.  I finally got them all folded in (I switched to my whisk continued to fold never stir, and it went better, then back to my spatula and didn't seem to lose volume).  Tomorrow I will fill it for my daughter's birthday.  If it is too brown, I will try to cut that part off and adjust my oven temp accordingly.  This is a great cake recipe if you like sponge cake, goes together fast if you get everything assembled.  Thank you.

Thanks so much for the quick reply!
Can another pan besides a spring form be used (such as a round cake pan)?
Today I'll show you how to make a simple but yet very moist and fluffy sponge cake you can use in your own recipes.  At the end of this video, there are 2 video links that will bring you to the 2nd and 3rd video in this series.  After making the sponge cake, I'll be making a strawberry puree, and in the final video (3rd ) we will be making a stunning strawberry shortcake, a French inspired version called a torte fraisier.  This was one of my favourite cakes to make while in pastry school a long time ago.  Bake time on this cake was approx 45 minutes.  Check with a wooden skewer  around the 30 to 40 minute mark in your oven to see if it is done.  Time will vary depending on the size of springform pan you use.

@Cathy thanks Cathy, sorry I cannot reply directly to your comment, you don't have Google Plus so there is no option to have me reply.
i try this recipe and it is great..thank you so much for sharing your recipe.
what kind of sugar? granulated or icing? :)
Can I use self raising flour instead of all purpose flour ? :)
+bakelikeapro,thank you for responding! Your recipe helped a lot!
Does the amount of eggs affect the mixture? Say you have one to less,is that gonna make it different in texture?
Im confused now. I learnt to add butter and baking soda is that a wrong method?
I like your show, Thank you for  your time and effort .... You use  all purpose flour only? do you ever mix any other flour  in it?  I am still learning  your video  help me a great deal, Thank you again
Do you think lemon and vanilla extract would taste good?
is it okay if i mix the eggs by hand coz i dont have a machine
great method , i was so worried watching other videos cuz it sounded hard to be done but i can totally do it this way . it is just that simple , so thanks alot
i love it
Hi there, im assuming this is self raising flour ?
hi so you don't add butter or baking soda right?
I love your lovely cake Recipes!
which flour did you used.
Can I do this without vanila ? cus I don't have it.
Hi, I've tried your chocolate cake recipe and it turned out great! I just want to know how this recipe would taste like since you are using 6 eggs. I mean out of all the recipes I've tried they've turned out to be eggy..so I'm a little worried lol
Thanks!!
yes that is correct.  Thick and fluffy is good.  There are 100s of different recipes for sponge cake, Gordon uses ginger because he wishes his sponge cake to be infused with a ginger flavor.  Ginger is not a traditional ingredient for sponge cake, but this is what makes the world interesting, - everyone can change a recipe to make it different.
If the batter is thick,it will form cake,right?because I watched lots of bids and some of them are quite confusing like this one"Gordon Ramsay sponge cake with fresh ginger"
I want to use this recipe for a character cake I'm making for my son. I have a few questions. Can this recipe be used in a 9x13 pan or will it have to be doubled? Is it moist or should i add sugar syrup before frosting? Is it cooled like regular cakes (in the pan 10 min then inverted to wire rack) or is there something else that needs to be done? I want to make the layers for the cake asap so any help would be awesome! Thanks.
Hi Esty, yes !  make sure your eggs have been out of the fridge for many hours.  The eggs will work much better ( you obtain much better volume with warmer eggs ) ( the eggs incorporate more air, more easily, make them fluffier.
Does the eggs must be room temp
I would suggest you can check for a microwave version of this cake, I do no make it in the microwave.  Maybe somebody will be able to help you or you will be lucky to see somebody making this in the microwave.
I have another video ( newer video ) on how to make sponge cake, you can watch this also.  Check my channel, I use a slightly different technique and this can help you hopefully.  Watch closely how I do it.
I really want to make this cake,but i only have microwave oven.
Those problems isnt what i make.But I tended to have butter in the whisk,does that effect eggs?.Overall,if the batter look thick,it should make cake,right?because I watched lots of videos,some of them are quite confusing like this one"Gordon Ramsay Sponge cake with fresh ginger".
You need to supply more info for me to help you.  What type of mixer did you use ? did you whip for a long time ? did you use high speed ? were your eggs at room temp ?  Without knowing, I cannot say, but I will guess and suggest 2 things.  Make sure your eggs are at room temp, and also you MUST whip at a high speed.  These are the 2 most common problems.  I hope this helps.
Hi,why my egg doesn't double in volumes?help,plz
Hi Darragh, there is NO fat in this recipe.  Sponge cake doesn't require it.  Sponge is supposed to be as light as air, and fat makes a cake heavier and changes the crumb or texture of the sponge.  The magic is in the eggs :-)
No butter can you tell me how many grams
Hi Hazel, yes you can, that's how most bakeries do it... you cut off the rounded part of the cake, and use that, and for a layered caked you cut the rounded top off and flip it over.... which gives you a perfectly flat top cake.
Can I turn my cake upside down to decorate it? I am in a cake decorating class and have not yet frosted a cake are there any dont's to that?
Hi, Please watch the video, I do not use any fat in this recipe.  I'm assuming by your question you haven't watched yet :-)  This type of sponge does NOT require any fat, sponge like this is lighter without any type of fat.  Fat makes a cake heavier in texture.  The eggs are all you need in this recipe.  Please watch this one, or my newer sponge video which also uses the same recipe.
may I know, is it ok to bake cake without oil or butter?
Hi Barbie, you can reduce the sugar if you wish, this is my standard sponge though and it's not at all overly sweet.  In this recipe the sugar also adds structure to the egg, that said, you can change up the recipe so that it better suits your needs, try it out and let me know, I look forward to hearing how it went for you.  Thank you for watching :-)
Can i reduce the sugar...i think is to much sugar
good luck boo nana :-)
:D thx really reallly muchhhh!  i'll try this with the stawbeli mousse tomorow! :目
Hi boo nana, 350 degrees F = 176 degrees C, but I guess 170 C is close enough.  I am using all purpose flour in this recipe ( also called plain flour ) and yes, you can break this down, simply reduce the recipe ingredients and you will be ok.  Thanks for watching :-)
You can use any of the online conversion websites to give you exact info.  For example, type into Google "1 cup of sugar in grams" and you will get many answers.
I don't understand your question.  I show all steps in this 3 part video.  If you watch this video, you will have your answer :-)  I would start there LOL
Hi alwaysSifyable !  Thank you for watching, and glad your sponge cake turned out so well !  Thank you for your feedback !
thank you so much..the cake turned out really well :)
yes, as long as it baked like a regular oven, that's fine
is it ok if you use those little ovens. like the ones that does stick to the wall .
Hello, yes you can, a simple electric mixer is 100% fine.
hi can i use simple hand mixer?
Hi Miriam, yes this is possible, that would be a nice variation.
Hi :) Can I add strawberry puree in this cake? to make straberry sponge cake?:)
Hi, I used regular all purpose flour.  Thanks for watching and good luck ! :-)
Did you use a cake flour or just a simple all purpose flour? Thanks. I will try this tomorrow.
Sponge cake requires no sort of fat.  Remember that fat makes a cake dense, but this is no ordinary cake, this cake is very much egg based.  Any sort of fat will make the cake more heavy and more dense, and yes, there are different types of sponge, but this recipe has no fat.  You'll see this is super light, and airy, you could use it as a frisbee :-)
Nice
Hi Laura, are you sure ? :-)  Try watching at 2 mins 20 seconds, the vanilla is added in at 2 mins 25 seconds  :-)  Yes, I do add it in, and you'll see me doing it :-)
Hi, when do you add the vanilla essence? It's not shown in the video
Hello, thank you for subbing :-) and thanks for your kind words :-)
Ur simply amazing with your tutorials. .I've subbd! :)
Hi Nectaria, that sounds great ! I hope you are sharing :-)  I'm hungry LOL.  Thanks for letting me know of your success.  I appreciate hearing from everyone.  Thank you.
Hi! I just finished making your sponge cake and I am so thrilled with the result I had to post this imediatelly! This recipe is the best I have tried (and I have tried lots!). The cake turned to be super fluffy, kept its "thickness" when it cooled off and got out of the pan with no effort leaving no marks, not sticking to anything....Amazing! I used 5 instead of 6 eggs and self rising flour instead of simple. Also I put half 30-40grams of brandy and vanilla essence! Thanks again!
Hi Selenge, I'm using granulated sugar.
hello, simple sugar or cane sugar?
Hi Josephine, you can use a regular cake tin, but make sure you really go around the edges well with a spatula before trying to remove the cake.  The baking paper on the bottom just lets the cake pop out, however, oil and grease your pan, then flour it, and you should not have a problem getting it out.  Don't worry, you'll still have a great sponge cake.  Take your time and have fun :-)
hi, it me again. Can we use any other type of pan? and must wee use the baking paper for the bottom?
no oil needed in this recipe :-)  I discuss this in further detail in the comments.
not oil ???
make to diz cake y not a use baking powder ? not a important  baking powder  :/
Hi Pallavi ! sponge cake does not require any type of fat.   This is how I was taught in French pastry school many years ago. There are different styles of sponge, which you will find DO contain butter.  A sponge cake has a very light texture, it should be like a sponge, light in texture.   If you wish to have butter in your sponge cake, you can find many recipes that use butter.  You must make a recipe that you suits you, and that you are comfortable trying.  I hope this helps a little bit.
hello, r u not add butter.. why?
Hi Narcisa, about 45 minutes to bake.  Sorry for the confusion, and thank you for watching :-)
Hello! i like your cake is so simple but i didn't here for how many minute to bake. I going to make this cake.
there is no cocoa powder in this recipe, however, if you are asking, if you can add cocoa powder, yes you could if you wished.  I'd remove 1/4 to 1/2 cup of the flour and replace it with the cocoa powder, and make sure you sift in with the flour, so that it is incorporated with the flour before adding it.
how much coca powder? Does it affect the amount of flour?
Yes, cocoa powder would add a nice chocolate flavor to this.
Granulated sugar.  Please search for my newer video also, on sponge cake / Strawberry shortcake, you may like this video recipe better.  Sorry for the lack of detail Hok.
how about chocolate sponge flavor? i'll just add chocolate powder right?
Plz....Give more detail about the ingredients.Whats kind of sugar?...
Hi Christy, true sponge cake never needs baking powder or baking soda.  You can use all purpose flour.
is it not necessary to add baking powder or sodium bicarbonate to de receipe..?? wat flour do u use
thanks for watching :-)
Love it
I tried﻿ this and it was very delicious
Today I'll show you how to make a simple but yet very moist and fluffy sponge cake you can use in your own recipes. At the end of this video, there are 2 video links that will bring you to the 2nd and 3rd video in this series. After making the sponge cake, I'll be making a strawberry puree, and in the final video (3rd ) we will be making a stunning strawberry shortcake, a French inspired version called a torte fraisier. This was one of my favourite cakes to make while in pastry school a long time ago.  Bake time on this cake was approx 45 minutes. Check with a wooden skewer around the 30 to 40 minute mark in your oven to see if it is done. Time will vary depending on the size of springform pan you use.

your welcome  :D
Hi Mandy, ahh thank you :-) and thanks very much for subscribing :-)  I appreciate all my subscribers.  Thank you.
I like you. I subbed  =)
Hi Yasmine, it's regular granulated sugar in this recipe.  Also - please check my main channel, scroll down the page, you will see a very new video ( the same recipe ) and it may help you as I explain better in this video. ( it's a sponge cake recipe )
Thank you!:) Also what type of sugar did you use?
Hi Yasmine, I personally wouldn't use buttercream, however if you love buttercream, you may absolutely use buttercream with this sponge cake.  No rules ! you make the cake your own, that's what is great fun about baking, you can change things up and try different combinations.
Hi Karla, if you are doing to make this in a jar, just make sure it is heat proof, that's the most important part.  Most cakes will bake fine in a jar, baking times may / will vary, but you have control over that when you are in the kitchen, ( you can test it when you think it's done ) Thank you for watching Karla :-)
Would it taste nice with buttercream frosting?
Hi, love your videos :D can I use this recipe to make cake in a jar ? Thank you =)
Hi Seema, I'm glad your kids enjoyed the video :-)  Thanks for watching :-)
my kids love it they tell mom it was very nice
By the way, look at my main channel listing I have re-done this recipe in a brand new video, it may clear up some of the technique I use, same recipe but new video.
Hi Eraya, no, no butter is needed.  Sponge cake is supposed to be very light.  The addition of any type of fat would make this cake dense and heavier.
Can add melted butter?
Hi Tsaschikher T, I used all purpose flour in this recipe, also I have this same recipe in a brand new video, look on my main Youtube channel you will see it there, it may help you a bit more.  Thanks for watching !
All purposed flour or cake flour????? Please reply mee
Hi Angela, I hope you try it out :-)  I do have this same recipe, in a newer video, so please check my channel for it.
i can't wait to try this out thans for the video
Hi Luminous Shara, I'm glad you tried it out, it's not the easiest cake to make, so that's great to hear ! and thanks for watching :-)
I tried this and it turned out perfect, it was yummy
Hi Jesse-Julian ....KitchenAid.  Many times you can find them on sale at a good sale price at Costco.  If you want a machine that will last for many years, it's the only way to go.  There are many models out there, but by far the KA is the most popular, a great, versatile mixer that does so many things.  That's my opinion, others may chime in with their opinions also :-)
What kind of stand up mixer do you recommend for a 2 person household
Hi Ghen, thank you for watching :-)  make sure you watch my new video of this recipe, I use a different technique, it may give you some more ideas also.
Hi Melz, just use a hand mixer, this will work.
gotta try this one! ;))
hi what if you dont have a mixer that has a whisk attachment
Hi AboveFloweryTreetops, thanks for your kind words, I do appreciate it.  If you liked this video, please check out my newer one, I do this same recipe, it's on my main channel listing, you can't miss it.  If you are going to try this sponge cake recipe, you may learn something more from the other video ( newer video )  Thanks for watching :-)
I like easy stuff and THAT was AWESOME!
For anyone interested, I did a new sponge cake video recipe, look on﻿ my main channel for "Easy Sponge Cake Recipe ! / Strawberry Shortcake Recipe " it's a new video, and shows a different technique of how to add your flour. It may be of interest to you. Thanks to everyone who has subscribed to me, I do appreciate every one of my subscribers !
Hi Aniva, it's all purpose flour I'm using in this recipe.  By the way, I have a new video of sponge cake, check my main channel, you may like this one also. I explain a lot more in it.
is it plain all purpose flour?
Hi again, I wish you good luck with my recipe :-)  Take your time, make sure you have ALL ingredients measured out, and just have fun !  Being prepared is half the battle, and have somebody help you add the flour as you fold it in, it's a lot easier, oh and add your flour slowly in, this is very important !  Ok have fun ! :-)
Hello !  pre-heating simple means turning your oven on the the temperature needed, once the oven has hit that mark ( it has reached that temp ) you can now safely put your cake into the oven.  NEVER put any cake into an oven that is cold.  I have a brand new video for sponge cake, please check my channel for it if you wish to see another method.  I hope this helps.  So on your oven, simply turn the oven to required temp, that is what we call pre-heating.
hi..kindly let me know how to preheat IFB Microwave Oven Grill - 20PG3S to the temp u said for sponge cake.
Hi nbeauty531, I hope you try my sponge cake recipe and see if you have success with it.  It's very hard to pinpoint problems without having a recipe, your method, your oven temp, etc, I would try another recipe you enjoy, or try mine here and see if things get better.  I do have a new video on this same sponge, which may give you more help in where you may have gone wrong.  It's so hard to tell exactly what the problem could be. I hope with more trying you can get a better sponge cake made.
Hi there ! thanks for watching my video recipe ! I appreciate it :-)  I hope you try it out.  I do have a brand new sponge cake video recipe, check my channel, it may help you more also.
response 2- so to clarify, when you are going to bake a cake, you want your oven hot before you put that cake into it.  Never put a cake into a cold oven.  So turn your oven on to say 350 degrees F, and you want it to be at-that temp before you put your cake in.  Your oven should beep a few times telling you when the oven is at that temp, and is ready for you to place you cake in.  This is called "pre-heating" your oven.  I hope this helps ! and thanks for watching :-)
Use the "bake" option.  The "broil" mode only turns the upper ( top ) element on in your oven.  It never goes off !  This is used to quickly brown something you put in there, like nachos and cheese, you can pop a try in and with the "broil" on, it will very rapidly melt the cheese, within a VERY FAST time.  30 seconds too long and your nachos will be burnt and the cheese also.   Bake is what you want.  Oh and ALWAYS pre-heat your oven, so turn your oven on before you put your cake into the oven.
My oven has 2 options bake and broil and im confused. Which one should i use??
reply #2 - so to continue, make sure the store has a good return policy ( Costco has a 3 month return which is amazing ), no, I have never wanted the tilt model, I like the power of the machines I have.  Do your research, check the watts on the machine also.  You'll see me using a DLX 2000 made by Electrolux in a few of my videos ( my new sponge cake recipe ) but that machine is very expensive.  I hope this helps a bit Haley :-)
Hi Haley, in the day when I bought my KitchenAid mixers, the tilt back models were less powerful.  Today I don't know the specs, but many of the cooking shows all use these, the reason being, it's the only model that can use a glass bowl ( good for showing the bowl contents ), that said, most pro kitchens use the non-tilt models, I'm still sure they are more robust.  If you buy one, make sure you buy one of the heavy duty models, and make sure they have a great return policy ( like Costco ).
I've been thinking about buying a KA stand mixer for a while now but haven't yet due to reading mixed reviews. I would like one with the lift bowl like yours. I wanted to ask if you recommend it or wish you had gotten a tilt back model? Also could you please tell me where you purchased your mixer from and overall if you recommend KA or wish you had gotten a different brand? Thanks in advance for your help! -Haley :)
response 4 - I hope this all helps a little bit.  Never give up.... by making mistakes ( us personally ) we get a feel for what we are doing and we can change and adapt our method, you WILL get better.  Take your time, and have fun, it will come together, and you will produce nicer cakes - I promise :-)  Thanks for watching :-)
response 3 - the flour was being poured too quickly for the amount of folding.  It's easy to fix this, just try and slow down on the addition of flour as you pour.  In baking school when I first started many years ago, we had a baking partner help us pour the flour until we could do it on our own.  I want you to go to my main channel and you will see a brand new video of me making sponge cake, I use a different technique, and you can try this also - this is another method you may wish to try.
response #2 - and let it slowly flow into the mixer bowl.  So you put your flour onto the paper, now grab both ends of the paper and bring them up, basically creating a little tube... as you now tilt the paper, the flour slides off the paper, like a slide at a waterpark ( sorry that is what came to my mind as I'm describing it ! LOL )  anyway, this can help.  You want to be constantly folding, and adding that flour very slowly as you do this.  The pockets of flour mean the flour was being...
Hi deedoryxxx, thanks for writing in with your question.  When you mention pockets of flour, this to me tells me right away that you are adding too much flour at a time.  If you have somebody to help you, this will really help you out.  In the pastry shoppe we use a piece of parchment paper ( you can use any type of paper ) and we pour the flour from the paper slowly into the mixer bow as we fold.  Fold the paper up so it makes a "u" shape with the flour in the middle, and slowly let it flow...
That's correct.  True sponge cake contains NO fat  Fat would only inhibit the volume the eggs want to obtain when whipped.  Sponge cake is light in texture, very few ingredients too. Any type of fast makes a cake more dense, and heavier in nature.  You add what you with to it, after it has been baked, toppings etc.  I hope this helps :-)  Thanks for watching and that was a great question keldipop !
Hi, I tried this method twice, however my results were still the same. My cake actually has many pocket of flour that sink to the bottomside of the cake, it wasn't as fluffly, it was rather coarse :( I sift the flour three times before folding it into the egg mixture. Is there any reason why it was like that?
wait, u didn't use any butter at all in this recipe?
This recipes requires a lot of air to be whisked into the eggs.  It is possible with a hand whisk, but you will become tired very quickly, and most likely never achieve the volume needed.  You can find inexpensive hand mixers for $10 at Wal-mart, Target etc, many stores sell very inexpensive mixers that will do the job.
Hi Trixxie !  You're welcome, good luck if you try it out :-)
Thank you for the advice , this helps me a lot , to try something different , :)
Hi Shushu3113, no, no baking powder is needed.  By the way, I just posted a brand new sponge cake recipe a few days ago, check my channel, you'll see it there.  The same recipe, different baking tin, you may get a few more ideas / tips by watching it.  Thanks for watching :-)
hello, just wanted to make sure that no baking powder is needed for his recipe. thank you
:-)
Hi Lily, thanks for watching :-)  by the way, I just posted another brand new sponge cake recipe just yesterday on my channel, you may be interested in watching it.
:D
Thanks I took your methoud and it turned out perfect
If your hands are motorized, then perhaps so :-)  Thanks for the funny question, you made me chuckle !
if i dont have a hand blender can i use my hands
I also forgot to mention I just uploaded a brand new sponge cake video TODAY, so check it out on my channel.... it may give you a bit more insight into how to make it.
Hi Trixxie, you can indeed use a hand blender ( electric ) there is enough power when used on the high setting, however you may need a partner to help you whip it, so have a friend there to switch places with you.  Use the high speed for the entire time too.  Once you stop, get it into your pan and into the oven asap, do not let it sit there, as it will start to deflate ( the air you whipped into it will slowly leave ) . Mister makes me so so old :-)  Good luck Trixxie !  Thanks for watching !
Hi, mister is there any chance I can use a blender to mix the eggs if I don't have a mixer machine? Does iit still going to produce the same volume and fluffiness ? Many thanks in advance
Hi Surabhi !  Yes, sure thing !  You can change this sponge cake up anyway you wish.  Anything goes, - whatever you like, you can add to this sponge cake.  By the way, - I'm uploading a brand new sponge cake recipe, it will appear in a few hours on my channel, so if you are interested, please watch it, you may get a few more tips on how to make it.  Thanks for watching ! :-)
Can we make a pineapple cake with frosting using a sponge cake by doing some changes?
Can we make a pineapple cake with frosting using a sponge cake by doing some changes??
I did not weigh the cake.  I'm sorry I can't give you an accurate weight of the sponge cake.
Hi smaqsoodkpmg, thanks for watching :-) I'm glad you enjoyed my video and I'm glad you tried my recipe out, thanks for the feedback !
about 225 to 250 grams.
I tried this cake and it turned out great. Thanks for the recipe.
How many grams is a cup???
Is it 1 kg cake?
Hi Greyson,  please read the other question you asked, I answered there :-)
Hi Greyson, if you don't have vanilla, you could use almond extract, if you like that, or use nothing, the cake will still turn out great.  If you plan on doing a lot more baking in the future, vanilla is a great thing to have on hand in your kitchen.  Thanks for watching Greyson :-)
if you don't have vanilla what can you use?
if you don't have vanila what can you use?
Hi Ruhi !  I used granulated sugar in this recipe.  Thanks for watching :-)
Hi, did you use granulated sugar or caster sugar?
Hi finzy, thanks or watching :-)  It's a great sponge cake recipe, take your time and have fun with it :-)
Hi finzy, thanks or watching :-)  It's a great sponge cake recipe, take your time and have fun with it :-)
wow yummyyy im so gonna try this out..im looking forward to making it,itmakes the kitchen smell nice when you bake it
good luck Suhyun ! let me know how it turned out if you make it :-)
Thanks for replying, I'm thinking of making the sponge cake very soon. :)
Hi maimia8888, it's all purpose flour I'm using in this recipe.  Thanks for watching :-)
Hi, what kind of flour did you used? is it plain flour, self-raising flour etc...
yes, - if you overfill the cake tin you will get a "cake top" which overhangs the tin, and the cake will be harder to remove, so yes, 3/4 of the way is perfect.  If you have left over cake, you can put it into a muffin tin, and make a mini sponge cake :-)
Should I fill the pan 3/4 of the way so it doesn't overflow?.
Hi Karla, you can use a normal pan, but you must use some sort of baking paper on the bottom.  This will ensure that the sponge cake comes out of the pan.  Use parchment paper ( baking paper ) this paper is available almost everywhere today.  Cut a little circle out, put it into the bottom of your pan, and this will work very well.
thank you for the answer ! :D i dont like the crunchy part, and glad this one is not :) is it okay if i use a normal cake pan ? not a springform
Hi TheSilverrose14, it can work, but it will be hard to get out of the pan.  IF you don't have one, then you could still try it, however yes, it's much easier with a spring form pan like you see me using in this video.  I'll be making this recipe again in the near future, where I go through the steps again, so that people may see more detail on how to make this lovely sponge cake.  Thanks for watching TheSilverrose14.
Hi,  will it still work without the tube pan? because i thought you needed one?
Hi Karla, no it isn't, it's nice and soft.  IF you like that, you could simply add a bit of sugar/butter/flour mixture to the top of it, and try that.  Sponge cake is really about what you put on it, AFTER it has baked, sponge is supposed to be super simple, you make it special later on.  This cake is so good though, that you can slice it and eat it like that, with nothing else.  It's super yummy.
Hi, is the top crust will be crunchy and sugary ? Thank you ! Would love to try out this recipe :)
Hi Stephanie, I'm using all purpose flour in this recipe.  I guess I should have noted this in the video, sorry for the trouble.  By the way, I'll be doing a new video of this same sponge cake in the following weeks, so keep an eye out for it, if you like sponge cake.  Thanks for watching Stephanie :-)
what type of flour is it
Hi Habibah, no, no need, in true sponge cakes, there is nothing but the eggs to make it rise.  Nothing more is needed.  I hope this helps.  Thanks for watching :-)
no baking powder?
you can use brown sugar if you wish, but this will add a different flavor to the cake, if you have a specific reason for using brown sugar, then yes go ahead.  Can I ask why you wish to use brown sugar ?
Hi Maritza, no, but you will have a harder time to get it out.  If you do not use a spring form pan, please use parchment paper on the bottom of your baking pan ( baking paper ) so the cake will just fall out.
Do you have to use a spring form pan
Hi abrar, thanks for watching :-)
response 2.  This technique is done with lemon loaf cakes..... you bake your lemon loaf, then you poke holes into the cake and drizzle the lemon syrup over the cake... the lemon juice goes into the tiny holes, and now your lemon loaf is full of lemon flavor.  I would suggest this technique instead of trying to add the lemon juice to the cake, also - the lemon syrup will have much more fresh lemon flavor.  I hope this helps WaveGlist :-)
Hi WaveGlist, sorry for the delay, I was away on a small holiday.  I am not 100% sure, I will be honest about this.  The acidity MAY conflict with the batter.  However, I will suggest something.  Once you bake the cake, you can may a simple lemon syrup.  You can add lemon juice to sugar in a pan, with a bit of water.  You heat the mixture so that it reduces down  ( it will thicken ) ... cut your cake, now take a brush and brush the lemon syrup over the cake ( not too much ! ) and this is amazing
m baking it hmm nice smell.....
Hi! Do you know if it's possible to add lemon juice to make it a lemon sponge cake, or would that totally ruin the batter?
Hi Freda, ah glad it is getting better.  One other suggestion that I just thought of, - you may wish to use "convection" mode on your oven, this helps circulate air around whatever is baking in the oven.  If you do have convection, try it sometime, and see if your results are better.  I'm glad to hear you had better success with it this time.  I'll be honest - sponge cake is not the easiest cake to make, so I'm glad you tried it again and didn't give up :-)  Thanks for the feedback Freda :-)
I made a second cake and it did'nt sink as much.I lined the pan without using a collar this time.:)
Hi Feda, if I think I know what you mean about the collar, this may have been the problem.  If the paper is slippery, the cake won't grab onto that paper correctly and this could have caused the problem.  I have never used a collar, and greasing or flouring the pan is not allowed, the cake needs something to hold onto while rising and baking.  I would try it next time without this paper collar.
I shall make another cake today,I did whip up the mixture as i thought long enough,baking time was as suggested, i did not open the oven door whilst baking,however since i saw how your cake curled over the edges, i made a wax paper collar to prevent any spillage on mine,would that make a difference?
Hi Freda, if you open your oven while it is baking, and it has not yet set, this can cause it to sink, also if the cake was not baked for a long enough time.  Make sure to test your cake with a wooden skewer when baking.  There are many possibilities, without being there with you, I can only guess.  Also, did you really whip the eggs very well for long enough time, and at high speed is another factor which can cause that problem.   I wish I could help you more than this.
I made this cake recently,but it sank in the middle! what was i doing wrong please?
Hi Anneque, if you don't have vanilla, then you can skip it.  Vanilla is nice, but if you don't have it or don't like it, don't add it.  Thanks for watching :-)
do you need to put vanilla???
No need.  It would make the cake more heavy.  All fats do this.  Sponge cake should always be very light.  Thanks for watching Yingz, and great question ! :-)
no need to add buter.?
Clean hands are a must when you cook and bake.  Thanks for watching Penter.
your hands are  so clean..............love it!
Hi tweewin !  I'm using all purpose flour in this recipe.  Thanks for watching :-)
What kind of flour is in your recipe? All-purpose? Cake flour??? Thanks for sharing!
Hi zaza12elly, I'm using regular granulated sugar in this recipe, however caster sugar will perfectly fine, as it's close to regular sugar ( caster sugar is much finer, but is closer to the sugar I'm using than confectioner's sugar )
hello mister chef :) are you using castor sugar or confectionery sugar? need to know asap :D
about 45 minutes.  I realize now I didn't indicate that in this recipe.  I'll be doing another sponge cake in the near future, keep an eye out for it, it will be more detailed.  It will be up on my channel within 2 weeks.
how long do you bake for?
Hi jema2609, I honestly don't know about the egg replacer.  Hopefully somebody who HAS used the replacer will post and let you know.  I have never tried it, so don't want to give you any info that is not correct.  I hope you can get some info and soon.  You could try replacing some of the eggs, OR, you could cut the cake into thinner layers and replace it with something else, like a fresh filling, so that your dad is not eating as much of the cake.  I hope that helps a little bit.
I was thinking of making Boston Cream Pie for Father's Day, but need to be careful of my dad's cholesterol.  Can I use egg replacer and still get a decent texture?  Or should I just replace a few of the eggs?  Please let me know at your convenience!
Hi Diana, yes it's very possible.  Care and being gentle is key, but that is the same for any cake, but yes, it's fine.   Thanks for watching :-)
Hi RockGod1321, ah great to hear.  Thanks for watching, and thanks for trying it out !
Hi Lisa, I do have a good vanilla cake recipe on my channel, as for the 30 cm pan check the other response I left for you. Good luck :-)
Hi Lisa, that's about 12 " , not quite but close enough, it may be enough, I've never tried it.  I guess you can try it out, if there is too much with a double batch, make another tiny cake using another tin.  I can't give you exact, and precise info because I have never tried it in a 30" square pan.
Aha, followed it anyway, come out great, cheer's for the vid :D
hey :) great video! is  this sponge cake fondant friendly??
Hi, a good mixer than can whip at a fast rate is required, and you want to whip it for a good 5 minutes.  If needed have a helper with you.  Also you want to have your eggs at room temperature.  Room temperature eggs always whip to a much higher volume.
being a RockGod, you know milk is for kids :-)  No, no milk required.  Thanks for watching RockGod1321
I used to try this. I used hand mixture to blend the egg. But it cannot raise the volume and fluffy. What shall i really do? Is that hand mixture is not good? Or can we need some more time to blend? Plzzz plzzz help me?
No milk? :S
Hi Gizzy, it was all purpose flour and also regular white granulated sugar
Hi Gizzy, I used all purpose flour
hi, what kind of flour did you use?  and what sugar? just the granulated sugar? thanks
hi, what kind of flour did you use?
Hi roshanay83, thank you :-)  there is no need for any leavening agent, true sponge cakes never use baking powder.  The truth is, the egg is all you need to obtain the volume.  That is how how my teacher showed us many years ago, and the principle still remains the same.  The eggs obtain the volume, and that is where the magic is.  Thanks for watching :-)
hi....ur recipes are very simple,easy nd delicious...thanks for sharing wd all of us...i want to ask..y dont you use baking powder in sponge cake?
Hi Elizabeth !  Yes, that's exactly what it is.  By the way Twinkies are still sold in Canada.  I believe all production of the very popular Twinkie in the United States was stopped several months ago.  To answer you question though, yes, that's what kind of cake it is.  Thanks for watching Elizabeth :-)
I am looking to make a twinkie like cake, would this be the same type of cake?
Hi Sharon, if you decide to watch this video, you'll notice a pop up on the screen showing the entire recipe.  On all my recipes I keep the recipe pop-up on screen long enough for you to jot it down, or simply pause the video and write it down.  I just don't have the time to write all my recipes down on a blog.  Sorry for the inconvenience.  I hope you decide to watch this video, it's a fun cake to make.
Where do i find the recipe and is it available to print out ?? Thanks  Sharon
Hi Lee Ying Ying, you will want to get yourself an inexpensive mixer ( they are as cheap at $9.99 ) this type of cake depends on the mixer, - you will become very tired before you achieve the volume necessary.  This cake depends on the eggs, it IS the structure of the cake.  If you can get a mixer, I highly recommend it.
Hi Ivonne, yes, that is what I was talking about :-)  Sponge cake is a more involved than making a regular vanilla cake.  If you feel you can do this one, indeed try it, it's fun ! is it easy enough ? well it is more involved and you may not have perfect results if you don't do it exactly as needed.  A simple vanilla cake would be much easier to try if you are a beginner.  That said, watch the video, and perhaps you will feel good about making this lovely sponge !
Oh i mean the sponge cake. Can i use the sponge cake as a base? Would it be easy enough to make? Sorry Im a beginner for baking
Hi Ivonne, it could be, but this cake requires a little bit more time to make, if you feel confident making it, then by all means try it.  It's a nice cake, but it a little more difficult to produce.  If you try it, please let me know how it turned out.  Almost midnight in Australia, so I'll bid you a good evening.  Thanks for watching Ivonne :-)
Hi, do u think i can use this as a base  to make a birthday cake?
Hi lisevi84, by 1 cup I mean a measuring cup, equal to 1 cup of sugar.  That is about 200 grams in weight.  I hope this helps
Hallo,may I ask you,whats the meaning of 1cup of sugar??can u give me for gram?thanks so much
Thanks !  I hope you find some recipes that interest you !
Hi there, yes, absolutely !  If you use an extra egg, it won't matter... eggs are what this recipe uses to make the actual cake rise, but yes, you can 1/2 the recipe.
okie dokie :-)
Oh, because I had not finished watching the whole video that time, and then I found out
Hi Marisa ! This must be a trick question LOL.  Yes, I do add flour in, if you watch the video, you will seeing me adding the flour :-)  Thank you for making me giggle this morning :-)
Why didn't you add flour in it?
Hi Jaime, it was about 45 minutes.  I just checked my recipe notes, and unfortunately I did not write down my exact time :-(  I'm sorry about this.  Make sure you use a wooden skewer and check your cake around the 35 minute mark, and keep an eye on it.
Hi Shelby !  Thanks for letting others know of your experience, much appreciated, and glad it turned out great !  and thank you for watching my video :-)
I baked this cake in a 10 in pan. Did not run over sides. The cake turned out really great.
It is a nine inch springform pan. I hope that helps :-)
It is a nine inch springform pan
Hi Renée Yes you could, but you would want to decrease the amount of other ingredients you use so that you stay within the recipe.  I hope that helps a bit
can i use 4 eggs instead of 6?
No leavening agents are needed in true sponge cake, the eggs alone are strong enough to do the job on their own.  Great question and thanks for watching :-)
Hi, What about baking powder?
Hi SoulleS1706, I pretty much knew you meant electric, but I just wanted to make sure.  Somebody on one of my videos asked about a hand mixer and it was one of the very old ones ( not electric ) , they had one and still use it ! .. wow.  They are collector's items now.  They are beautiful kitchen tools.  Yes, testing is a great idea !  I wish you bonne chance !
thank you so much for your answer, i was talking about electric handmixer of course .. and i already had in mind to test the receipe next weekend, i don't want bad surprises the day i'll be making the big cake :D
Yes, it can be done with a hand mixer ( if you mean electric, like you see me using in many of my videos ) you will have to whip it for some time, but yes it can be done.  I'd get somebody to help you so that you can take turns.  Time passes very quickly when the KitchenAid mixer is doing it for you ( you can do other things while it whips ).  If you are a bit in doubt, I'd do a test run of the recipe, perhaps breaking the recipe down to 1/2 size and test it and see.  I hope that helps a bit :-)
hi, i'm looking for the perfect sponge cake receipe because i'm planning to bake a layered cake for a birthday in 3 weeks .. can this receipe be done with a simple handmixer ?? because i don't have a kitchenaid .; thank you !!!
Hi Natalia, please check my channel I do have a pecan pie recipe there, let me know if this is what you need.  I've made some nice lemon curd also :-)  look up "tarte au citron" on my channel too :-)
Hi Natalia, yes it will work fine.  Thanks for watching :-)
Hi! It will work if i put colorant into the mixture without adding egg yokes? Thank you :D i love your fudges!!  Can you do a pecan pie or a lemon curd??? thanks!
Hi! It will work if i put colorant into the mixture without adding egg yokes? Thank you :D i love your fudges!!
Hi! It will work if i put colorant into the mixture without adding egg yokes? Thank you :D i love your fudges!!
Hi Monica, thanks for the very kind comment :-) you make my day ! :-)  I've always loved teaching, and try my best.  If I don't pass along info I know, then I feel like I have cheated somebody.  If the tables were turned and somebody gives me info, I appreciate that immensely.  Thanks for the nice comments, much appreciated !  Have a great day and weekend also Monica ! :-)
Great video! I just want you to know that its very nice of you to reply to every single person who comments and even give detailed instructions to those who ask. Even though I've never asked anything, I'd like to thank you in behalf of those who were not able to. You're an excellent cook and a great great person. Keep it up. The world needs more people like you. Have a great day!
Hi Lucy :-)  Yes, I kept my KitchenAid mixer at full for those 5 minutes.  These mixers are made to work hard, and that is nothing for the mixer to do.  You really do want to get full volume out of those eggs, and this is what does it, the high speed of the whisk aerates and gives volume to the eggs.  I hope this helps out a little bit Lucy.  Thanks for watching my video too :-)
Hi. I really like the video but I just wanted to ask, when you keep whisking the eggs for 5 min, do you leave it at full power. Thank you
A sponge cake needs to be very airy and fluffy, egg whites are what accomplish this.  If you used whole eggs, the chemistry of the cake has changed so much, that the cake will not rise like it is supposed to, whole eggs will prevent the cake from rising like it would when only using the whites.  Whole eggs would also change the texture of the sponge, and in reality it is no longer a true sponge cake.
what is the difference between beating the whole egg and egg white separately?
Hi Joy,  that was regular white sugar.  Yes, you can use a blender instead of a mixer.  Thanks for the question and thanks for watching :-)
Hi, what sugar was that? And can i use a blender instead of electric mixer?
Hi fawad, you are correct, there is no butter in this recipe.  Sponge cakes do not use any type of fat.  Thanks for watching my video.
you  didnt put any butter
If you do, do you need to add extra sugar if you put cocoa and how much cocoa?
Hello Denise, yes you can if you wish.
hi i want to ask if i can put some flavor like cacao powder or vanilla ?
I'd search one of the BIG recipes sites , there are many recipes which I'm sure you may wish to try out. If you use something like baking powder or baking soda, I'd still NOT grease the sides of the tin, but if you wish to experiment, you should, so you can see what results you get in your kitchen.  Many sponge recipes include chemical agents, and they will produce a great cake, and this helps somebody in a kitchen who doesn't have a lot of experience. I hope this helps you out a bit liebc0
Hi, just want to ask, I've made Chiffon cakes before with 6 eggs and I find that it has a very eggy flavour. I see you mentioned that real sponges don't have any raising agents like baking powder but I have never made a cake without this. Do you know of a recipe with less eges but just as fluffy? P.S. Thanks for the tip of not greasing the pan, is this true for sponges with raising agents too?
Hi Tejaswi, glad it turned out great for you !  sponge cake is not the easiest thing to make, and it's fine that you added that, it may have saved the day.  I'm glad you tried it out, and happy you let me know, it's nice to have feedback, thanks for watching my video Tejaswi :-) and enjoy your sponge cake !
I made this today and it came out really really well :D But I used a half tsp baking powder to make it raise a little more cuz I hand whipped the eggs and was afraid that they weren't going to raise :D thank you so much
Hi Aisyah, thanks for the kind comment ! and for watching my video :-)  Thank you.
wow! simple and easy procedure, thanks a lot of this video and more power.
Being classically trained, we were taught that you never butter or oil a pan when making a sponge cake.  True sponge cakes do not use any sort of chemical agents to help with the leavening, the egg does it all, and the egg MUST have something to grab onto, in order to climb, if it encounters a slippery side of a baking pan like oil, or butter it has nothing to grab onto, and so it will not rise as effectively.  This was the way I was taught, so I thought I should provide correct info.
try apply soft butter to the side of the pan
Hi awseomenaats, thanks very much for a very kind comment.  It's nice to hear positive feedback, I'm glad the video was clear and well explained for you.  Thanks very much for watching it, I DO appreciate it.
Hi Tejaswi, that is just regular all purpose flour.  I should clarify this in future videos.  If I say just say "flour" then it means all purpose regular flour, sorry for the confusion.  Thanks for watching my video :-)  Thanks for the kind comment too :-)
Is that self raising flour or just the normal all purpose flour?? :) I loved it btw :)
Hi Lauralee026, glad you found my channel :-)  glad you enjoyed the recipe.  Check out my others, you may like some of them.  Thanks for taking the time to watch my video and comment ! and I hope your cake turned out great !
so its christmas and for some reason i feel like i have to do all my baking from scratch, i love your no butter recipe and it was SO simple, i just popped mine in the oven wish me luck :) thank u millions for making this vid, keep up the good work <3
Hi JoMike3104, glad you found my video :-) and hope it helps you out.  The answer is no to your question, stick or non-stick, it's the same temperature for the cake.  I hope your cake turns out if you try it.  Good luck ! and thanks for taking the time to watch my video !
been looking for a simple sponge cake recipe. glad i found your video. i just have 1 question...do you use different oven temp with a non-stick pan?
Hi there, if you mean a small mixer, yes you could.  If you mean something else, please explain a littler more so I can help you better.  Thank you for watching my video :-)
Hai can i  using a mixi for mixing the ingredianets ?
Hi artet64, If you have an electric hand blender ( like the one you see me using in many videos ) that will also work.  Believe it or not, you can do it manually with a whisk too, but you will be very tired :-)
Hi artet64, thank you very much for the kind comment :-)  It's comments like this that tell me I'm doing something right :-)  You have a good sister there ! :-)  Thank you again !
Also, what can I use instead of that type of electric whisk? I have a handheld one, but it doesn't spin that fast...
Last time I tried to bake a sponge cake my dad said it felt like a brick... Thank you for this awesome playlist! I really think you should be more popular. You're tutorials are so easy to follow and I've got to  admit my sisters love your pizza ideas and recipes ^u^ Keep baking!
Absolutely, you will get a great result with it.
Hi MsGlenzki, there is no baking soda or baking powder, none is needed in this recipe.  The secret is in the eggs, you really need to whip them to obtain maximum volume.  It is a great recipe !  Thanks for taking the time to watch my video !
u dont use baking soda or baking powder for this?
There are recipes that only use eggwhites. I am not sure about the actual sponge itself, if it will become less, but you will change the flavour, something I wouldn't want to do, but you can try it, there is no harm, and nothing will go that wrong, that you would have to toss it out.  It will be deeper in flavour though.
yes, you mean to make 3 layers ?, yes, certainly you can.
Hi mikimiaw91, I'm using regular all purpose flour.
may i know what kind of flour you use?? The normal 1 or d High-ratio/superfine flour??
Hi Fitange, when you subscribe to a person, there is a somewhat hidden option to be alerted via email for all new uploads from that channel.  If you don't, then you don't get any updates, but only a weekly ( single email ) that tells you what uploads all channels have uploaded.    Thanks for the comment :-)
Omg I missed this video! Damn YouTube isnt sending me new videos from my subscriptions . I love this recipe
"MOM! GRAB THE CAR!! TO HEB!!!!"
Hi artet64, It's a bit tricky, but the key thing is to NOT overmix, be super gentle with it, AND make sure your oven is ready to go.  You do not want the mixture to sit in the cake pan, you mix it, pour it, and into the oven it goes.  If you try it some day, I hope it goes better this time for you !  Thanks for the interest in my videos.
only 5 ingredients? yay! Last time i tried a spongecake, my dad said it felt like a brick :/
