the video talked about primers and setting powders, but how would you go about fixing sprays? do you avoid fixing sprays when wearing sunscreen?  sometimes, i apply sunscreen, wait 20 minutes, then apply makeup and a bit of fixing spray.. but now i'm wondering if that disturbs the sunscreen just like a primer would or if it's somewhat acceptable just like the setting powder!! thank you for this video!
In regards to layering different types of sunscreen that have avobenzone:  What if your sunscreen has 3% Avobenzone, but it's a mix of actives with the higher percentages in Homosalate , Oxybenzone, and Octisalate? Is it ok then to use a foundation on top that has a mix of sunscreen actives with Titanium Dioxide and Octinoxate?   Or are we still just really messing up our sunscreen protection?
The reapplying thing was something I've always been bothered about. I think after this I'll just carry a wet wipe and my makeup bag everyday.
This was extra helpful as someone with dryish, sun sensitive skin in Australia. Thankyou. Also tinted sunscreens for the face are a great  option 😀
I feel so sad that seems it's to best not to wear any makeup on top of the sunscreen as chemical sunscreen always have avobenzone and cosmetics always contain octinoxate, zinc oxide or titanium dioxide :(((( and there might be other possible reactions of the UV filters with the makeup :(((😭😢😭😭😭😭
love your vids!!! <3 Sorry that I still got couple of questions: so all makeup is fine so long as they don't contain zinc oxide and titaniam dioxide? but sadly most of the powdered foundation/ tinted setting powder/ concealer/ foundation etc contain these :((((which is very sad) is it best to not wear any makeup at all to avoid possible reactions with the makeup products? some people also say cosmetics contain iron oxide which gives protection against blue light...I'm so confused...Is it that i can only use baby powder to set the makeup to make my face less shiny and to 'set' the sunscreen in place??🤕 Thankss a lott (also if I apply vitamin c before the sunscreen, is my face still considered 'dry' for the sunscreen to best take effect??)  sorry for the many questions :(((
if my sunscreen doesnt dry, does it mean that it doesnt work
Would you talk about sunscreens with a tint so I can stop foundation cosmetic? The couple I tried were a weird color. Also would you talk about SPF hats, clothing?
I don't wear makeup but I use a primer for the mattifying effect, I apply primer first and then spf, is that correct?😮😮❤
🤍
FANTASTIC ❤
This is super helpful and very well explained! Thanks a ton! 🤓
Great video! I'd love to know your thoughts on UV/LED lamps for nails and crafting projects.
is it true that Zinc Oxides are degrading the sun protecting effect of a chemical sunscreen to a degree where it basically delivers no more protection against UVA rays??  EVERY kind of make up has zinc or titanium oxides in it. So is it true that if we put on make up over chemical sunscreen, we no longer are protected against UVA?? :((
Should you use primer before or after SPF?
This was very useful. Thanks!
whoops. just found out my sunscreen and bb cream don’t play nice - sunscreen has avobenzone, bb cream has zinc and titanium oxides
Hi! I know this is an older video, but this seemed like the best place to ask a question I've been thinking about recently.   Should I be concerned about how effective my spf is when used with cosmetics containing Upsalite? My basic understanding of Upsalite is its meant to soak up extra sebum/oil and sweat. Would inorganic vs organic spf behave differently with Upsalite?   To give you a specific product with Upsalite in it, Danessa Myricks Blurring Balm Powder contains it.  Thanks so much for all that you do!
Sunscreen icon✨❤️❤️
Thanks so much for doing this video!
An actual PhD who knows how to do proper scientific literature reviews and bases advice on actual research ❤ it pains me that this channel has never had nearly as many subs or views as “beauty gurus” peddling pseudoscience. It says a lot about society.
Can you mix using a chemical sunscreen lotion with a mineral spf powder on top to lessen shine? Or should a powder with no spf better?
I want to be up at night and sleep in the day, but there is so much noise in the day! We need a vampire community lol.
12:08 Thank You!! I've been looking for the answer on this question for so long. So it seams that I can use some mattifying sheets or normal tissues to remove excess oil and it won't destroy my sun protection completely. It's so important to me, because I get oily even after applying sunscreens like LRP Shaka fluid or Biore (which I generally love)
It would be nice to have a list of make-up that coincide with each other and sunscreens. I know coating the titanium and zinc helps but we don't know which brands do this and won't interact with the chemical. I too like using a chemical because I get the La Roche-Posay one that goes into the high ranges...which you can get anywhere, because, internet! Anyways, it just would be nice to know which foundations I can slide over that. So annoying. On my regular workdays I just put on mineral sunblock, then a primer with mineral, then a foundation with mineral, then blush with mineral and powder with mineral. Then sit in a windowless room all day long, so...figure that's enough. But for hikes and stuff I'd like to use this La Roche-Posay one. I always wear a hat and sunglasses as well. I try to stay as covered as possible. Probably a little neurotic about it.
I've never heard of rub-resistant sunscreen? Is water resistant sunscreens also rub resistant?
Dr Dray says "no blotting paper after sunscreen!" 🤫😁
if i want to put powder on my face, wont it take away some of the sunscreen by mere application ? also how can i then reapply if im not supposed to have powder under the layer of sunscreen ? genuinely wondering because without powder i cant stand the feeling of sunscreen on my face and cant wrap my head around the fact that ive been putting too much sunscreen on
Hi Michelle! You mentioned that you have managed to find a couple of sunscreens that suit your oily skin type and don't ball up at all. Please could you share what they are, and if they sit well under make-up?
Your voice is so good. ❤️
What about a product like Dr Jarts bb creams? It’s basically a tinted moisturizer. That’s what I usually use.
thank you so incredibly much.  Im embarrassed to say ive just started using sunscreen on a daily basis. I have sensitive skin so  started out by using inorganic (physical ) sunscreens. I definitely want to try (and eventually switch to) chemical sunscreens with the new UVA filters.  However, i use a powder mineral foundation which contains zinc & titanium dioxide and has an SPF of 25. I definitely want to try the La Roche-Posay Anthelios ultra or invisible fluid (those UVA filters!). But they both contain avobenzone . Would that destabilise or render the sunscreen ineffective? Would the same be true for all chemical sunscreens? Stay away from chem sunscreen with Avobenzone? I am in australia so would be using the Au/eu formulations of La Roche posay sunscreens ( the avobenzone is more/ better stabilised in them) The amount of powder i do use is  incredibly small ( about 1/8 of a teaspoon... probably less actually) .  Many women who do use a chemical sunscreen and layer powdered mineral foundation over the top... some moisturisers contain zinc too... And most , if not all foundations contain zinc or titanium....  Thank you so incredibly much again Michelle!
From your ig story!
Have you done any videos on CC cream?!
I really appreciate your videos, this answered a bunch of questions I've had about sunscreen all in one place. Thanks for demystifying this stuff!! 💖 Also your infographics are helpful too, I bet it takes yonks to make em hey?
Thank you Michelle ❤️❤️❤️
This is great to hear with my fair, freckly skin. I would like to not age more, thanks very much, so I am being careful and wearing sunscreen every day. I do care about my skin, had a scare with a Bowen lesion in the last 3 years and that reminded me how lax I've been regarding sun protection, same goes for looking after my skin in general. Great, I'm wearing sunscreen and BB cream that is spf42 (my sunscreen is 50+) because I like the appearance of them together. They are both chemical sunscreens. I put my layer of BB cream in rather than rubbing. It seems to work.
I use the Murad Invisiblur Perfecting Shield SPF30/PA+++. It’s a silicone primer and a sunscreen in one. It’s my favorite formulation, as it doesn’t ball up with the skincare I wear Underneath and it stays put for 12 hours. You can also re-apply it on top of foundation with a fluffy brush. I let it dry for a few minutes, Then I lightly buff a mineral powder foundation that has a SPF of 15 on top. I really wish the Murad product had a SPF of 50 😳 but it’s the sunscreen formulation that fits in flawlessly with my makeup routine, so I’m happy to wear it every day. I just love your videos!! ❤️❤️🙏🏻 thank you!
Hi Michelle! I thought experts have debunked the myth that retinoids make your skin photosensitive? Or it isn’t really a myth in the first place?
Does using a *damp* makeup sponge to apply foundation after foundation disturb sunscreen?
I love the saracasm! 😍
But what about primer?  So moisturizer, primer, SPF?
My takeaways (I’m taking notes for myself as I watch 🤣) :  - makeup containing sunscreen is ... pretty useless - apply skincare first - then apply sunscreen - let sunscreen dry down for 8+ minutes  - if using primers or foundations, the oils can mess with the nice smooth sunscreen layer and reduce SPF; so instead of swiping or rubbing in your liquid makeup, use a beauty blender or compact puff to pat it onto the skin - when reapplying later, keep in mind that the existing makeup underneath the reapplied sunscreen will mess with the smooth layer that needs to form, thus reducing SPF. act accordingly.  - if a sunscreen isn’t working within your beauty routine, try to find one more cosmetically elegant - the nambour study is AMAZING and has literally saved lives (and fine lines)
I think Hamilton Face +50 SPF is so underrated. Have you tried it?
I found a study that says about reaply washing away the previous layer of SPF  or it will  damage even more but wash every 2 hours is absurd if you stay at home okay but at work or outside I have to use micellar water  that is easier, then apply  antioxidant that help UV protection.,but micellar doesn't clean pores as like double cleansing 🤦🏻‍♀️😖 how to manage this ?
I am really having a hard time (with a lot of this) but specifically the experimental design. How does the storage of a product at 40 degrees for 6 weeks accurately reflect the outcome under normal conditions after 1 year?
So helpful! Thank you! I was freaking out when I realized my organic sunscreen did not have zinc oxide in it.  Turns out I'm fine.  But some foundation I use has SPF in it. So now wondering if it will deactivate my sunscreen that I start off with.  PHEW!
Wow I’m so happy to have found your channel!! Quick question here - if I’m just working indoor in the office, or wear a cap that can block my face from direct sun light, should I still wear sunscreen during the day?
Has anyone any recommendation for a moisturizer with spf or a sunscrren that doesn't have the typical sunscreen smell? The one I use is pretty expensive, but I don't want people asking me why I wear sunscreen in winter/on a rainy day/etc. I don't mind smelling like sunscreen in summer and late spring, I don't mind smelling like it at all, but I don't wanna get asked stupid questions from my family members who I think sunscreen is keeping you from getting a tan and that a tan is very important.
Can I use primer on top of my sunscreen
thank you for this video!
Good information..Tq
This video is so extremely useful 😍😍😍
Extremely helpful ❤️
I can't thank you enough for the time you take to share fact based information in a way that's interesting. Beauty is more than skin deep. 🥰
You skip important topic to display that is allergy.  Can you please cover it some are concerned about the skin allergy rather than aging or sun spot as they can be managed but the irritation is really irritating as it bothers day to day activities.  Is it OK to avoid sunscreen if they irritate the skin?
Can I mix some of my moisturizer with my inorganic sunscreen?
Wow this presentation is INCREDIBLE! Extremely informative, I learnt SO much! Thank you! X!
People like YOU need millions of subscribers. Not Jaclyn fuckin’ Hill. Geez.
this is so informative, thanks a lot for sharing :)
I just found out about this video and some products contain both Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane (avobenzone) and titanium  dioxide inside, isn't that clashing? The product I found that contain both ingredients is Cetaphil Daily Defense Moisturizer spf 50+
4:12 Do you know if using a powder containing titanium dioxide is not a good idea to use on top of a sunscreen containing avobenzone? I use a powder foundation on top because without it my face is intolerably shiny, but is it then reacting negatively with the sunscreen ingredient?  I'm in Canada btw so I haven't come across any sunscreens locally that use newer filters - I've started using neutrogena because of the helioplex stabilization but I don't know if that protects the avobenzone from the ingredients you mention here. Thanks!
I thought sunscreens need to be reapplied every 2 hours, but the bottle in your video says every 4 hours.  Are the North American sunscreen companies getting us to use more so we purchase more?? 🤔
Thank you so much for making this educational video!
Hi,  Do you think having shiseido clear stick sunblock underneath Le roshe posay cream sunblock is bad idea?  I tried to check the ingredients but I got more confused!
If I applied sunscreen by itself and then added some SPF into my foundation on top of that would it be alright? (*_*)
Hi Michele, I have been applying tetrinoin Everyday and am suspecting it is making my face aged. I apply sunscreen diligently though :/ but I see wrinkles
Found my answer to my question about mixing foundation into my sunscreen, here in this video. 😊
I gently blot after applying sunscreen. Dr Dray said that I’d be blotting away the SPF too. 😟Whats a girl to do?! Especially since I prefer inorganic sunscreens and there isn’t any that isn’t shiny (I’ve tried dozens and dozens over my decades of using sunscreens!).
Great informative video! I understand that i shouldn't mix regular makeup with sunscreen but what about mineral powder? My Sunscreen contains titanium oxide so it should be safe to mix with powder? Or could there be a problem with other ingredients?
Your videos are always super informative, I'm trying to find a good organic sunscreen that's also good for the environment, any suggestion. Thank you
“But because you’re here watching this video, probably you do” 😂😂
I looooooove what you share. I love it! Beauty in a whole new level. I  Would love to know more abot the studies that you mentions, I'd love to read them:)
So glad I found you.
can you layer k beauty sunscreens with mineral sunscreens ?
So glad you make this video. Thanks  a lot.
Thank you for hammering the importance of sunscreen into my head🙏 I will now go and hammer them into the heads of my friends who say that they're too lazy to wear sunscreen👌
I have to say that the biore sunscreen is not good because although it sinks fast into the skin that’s because it has such a high alcohol concentration (go and look at the ingredient list) which is so irritating for the skin... don’t buy it!
The first part hurt me because it told me what I sort of knew but didn't want to admit. I have sensory issues and find most sunscreens suffocating, even the biore ones. I have super pale skin and grew up in the 90s being forcibly slathered with horrible sticky creams all summer and I just still have that inherent revulsion towards that feeling. I've been telling myself it's fine because I spend most of my time indoors and I live in Scotland which is really dark. But I know it's bullshit because I have freckles which means I'm getting sun from somewhere obviously (I do like my freckles though, it makes me sad to know they're a bad sign). Ugh. I just ordered the purito centella unscented and I'm just hoping it's the key for me.
Hi @lab Muffin Beauty Science I am in love with your channel!!! Your videos are so well done so much information i can see it is your passion! So much appreciated!!! Thank you <3
Thank you so much for all this information!!
I never used in my entire life toxic sunscreen, without the sun there would be no life on earth, no production of the important Vitamin D. I look 20 years younger without sunscreen. If you are a toxic cesspool of toxins and have nutrient deficiency, not enough antioxidants yes the skin could look damaged if exposed to the sun, but it is not the sun that does that, the sun only brings the toxins on the surface. People who live in the Northern hemisphere, have more cancer than people who live in the south.  How come people are more sick with the flu in the winter?  The sun has great healing abilities. I enjoy the sun on my skin in the summer...
I have a question about sunscreen reapplication. If I apply a chemical sunscreen first, can I then apply a physical sunscreen two hours later and viceversa?  Secondly, if my sunscreen is physical and my makeup has a chemical sunblock, do these two conflict?
Woooow!! This was absolutely amazing I never found a video that explained most of my doubts! Thank you so much!!!!!!!!
Hi - love your channel! Would love to see a video about organic sunscreens that are also reef safe. If you have any recommendations of sunscreens we can get in Australia that would be amazing. Thanks for creating such awesome content!
After this video a realized I was not only applying a sufficient amount of sunscreen, I was doing everything wrong!!! What are your favorite sunscreens?? My skin is also oily!!
Omg U sound like a computer
What was the light you used.?? Uv light? And where to get that?
Please make a video on how to apply spf evenly and the best techniques.
Thank you for your great videos!!
if am indoors and don't step out of the house because of quarantine, is it necessary to reapply sunscreen, or can i just do with one suncreen application?
My new favorite beauty channel. So informative and trustworthy due to the science/research-based approach! Thank you for doing what you do 😊
Plz a vidéo about hyperpigmentation ? 😭
I well come back to this video in 10 years and i will proudly say that this video saved my skin , for real.
So, what if I use a chemical sunscreen with the “good stuff” and then add a tinted sunscreen as a primer? Both sunscreens at 50. Now buying sunscreen from Europe and Korea.
Nice concept . Keep it up 😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘
so basically we just can't use oils during day time at all? :(
Can i put a translucent powder on top of my shiny sunscreen?  to help take the shine away
I've watched this video before but can't believe the gems I skipped. Thanks 😘  Question: I use CeraVe moisturizing cream in a tub in the morning and it contains petrolatum. Will it affect the sunscreens' adherence since its an oil (I think)?
Hi! Is there any concerns about powder that absorbs oil from the sunscreen, could affect the products formula in how it lays and protects the skin?
Love uuuuu!!!!
what about clogged pores? I'm always worried about clogging them up and a lot of the face sunscreen isn't a very high SPF : right now I try to use OLAY complete Daily moisturizer and SPF 15 sunscreen. : I think I'll grab one of the ones linked :) the Elta MD looks promising :)
if i could like this video more than once, i would! i work in the skin-care advice industry in australia, and there is a tough barrier of getting through to people that spf in makeup is not enough and will never be enough.
TYVM for the great info and well-designed video. Subscribed and alerted!
Will rubbing in a primer before makeup on top of sunscreen ruin the protection?
Isn't Zinc and PHYSICAL sunscreens the ones that protect from UVA rays?
I read that Chemical sunscreens need to be absorbed into the skin first so it is better to apply them before any skincare or makeup, and that Physical sunscreens need form a barrier over the skin, so one can apply them after any skincare or makeup.  What are your views on this?
Thank you so much for this video, I learned so much. I am diligent about applying sunscreen daily but I had no idea I could be compromising it by the way I used skincare underneath or putting a few drops of foundation into my sunscreen layer - I though I was just making a nice BB cream. I’ve taken notes and will be making adjustments.
I have been wanting a video like this for so long. I'm always worried when I wear makeup the sunscreen underneath shifts with blending etc and I looked videos up online to help but nothing talked about it. Thank you for this!!
I sweat a lot. Whatever I wear during summer, whether it be sunscreen or makeup, my face sweats up a lot.
This clears up all my sunscreen confusion! Thankyou so much!!
I know you said not to mix makeup w sunscreen because it creates holes in your skin making it succeptible to uv damge but can i mix iron oxide in my sunscreen to protect me from visible light? As well as making it tinted and not give me a white cast.
So can I mix 2 drops of oil into my moisturiser before wearing my sunscreen or would this break down my sunscreen?
Also some of my bb creams that have high spf labelling contain both AVOBENZONE and TITANIUM dioxide... As you said..These react to one another...HOW are they in the same formula????
Just discovered your channel, excellent video👍
I hope you answer as I dont know how to do. Can I use chemical sunscreen under mineral or mineral under chemical. Or can I layer different mineral sunscreens (not mix) and layer different chemical sunscreens?  Also where do you stand on chemicals as toxic and sunscreens that have alcohol denat in them? I ask because I use a serum, then a sunscreen and then pattingly top it off with a foundation with broad spectrum foundation and a powder that also has broad spectrum protection. I have heard that although some ingredients might react to one another, they need more time for that to happen (that 8-12 hours) isnt enough to ingredients to break down. Thanks! love your channel
Can you please also mention sunscreen brands to help.. great educational video though..
you'e awesome , you answered all my questions about sunscreen , i only have one question , which should i apply first primer or sunscreen ?  and thank you very much for these really useful info .
No sunscreen blocks all of the sun's rays.You're MUCH better off getting yourself some good hats (not straw hats or cloth hats.Opaque plastic sun visors and leather or vinyl cowboy hats) and only go out when the sun's directly above (noon to two P.M. in the summertime)and DONT LOOK UP INTO THE SUN OR YOU'LL GET WRINKLES ALL OVER YOUR FACE AND CATARACTS IN YOUR EYES.EVEN IF YOU'RE WEARING THE BEST SUNSCREEN YOU CAN FIND AND THE BEST SUNGLASSES YOU CAN FIND.Also always sit in the 100% shade of a building NOT the shade of a tree because under a tree the sun can get through.Also dont use parasols or umbrellas to shade your skin from the sun because the sun can get STRAIGHT THROUGH a parasol or an umbrella.Also the sun can get through all glass windows including the glass of any vehicle.Therefore if you're going to be in any type of vehicle THAT'S where you can wear the best sunscreen you can get (one with SPF 30 or higher and UVA,the aging ray blockers Parsol 1789 3% photostable,Avobenzone,and stay away from Oxybenzone),sunglasses and keep the windows up and the airconditioning on in the summer.However NO SUNSCREEN OUT THERE CAN BLOCK ALL OF THE SUN'S RAYS JUST BY ITSELF.That;s why you should only wear the best sunscreen you can get and the best sunglasses you can get only in a vehicle with the windows up and the airconditing on in the summer.
a small thing but: maybe put the ding sound effect at the end of the questions to the end of your answer? it would make more sense that way.
Great video! What do you think about the filters of ISDIN water fusion SPF 50, its very pretty under make up but I have been told that the filters that they use are not the most photostable. Thank you in advance.
this is too much math for me
What’s with your fake voice and omg your lack of knowledge is extremely cringing.Your not meant for YouTubing.
The science! The molecular structures!! The graphs!! The CITED RESEARCH💕😭   Perfection.
Thank you for this great video! I do like your comment about patting it in vs rubbing, I like to pat and so many people tell me it is a waste of time. But I never have issues with pilling or balling up sunscreen, so they can go enjoy their balled up sunscreen. :)
Great video! Between u n Dr Dray I feel Im 'covered'!! Thx...
Hey hi, the biore sunscreen you mentioned in the description has octinoxate which I read somewhere  is not so  safe although  I think there’s no proven side effects of it and the fact that the chances of skin cancer are much higher than unproven hazards of octinoxate.. Could you please tell me if or not should I completely avoid the ingredient¿
Which tinted moisturiser do u use?
You stated in the video that you had managed to find two sunscreens that worked for you under makeup without balling up. Would you mind sharing what those two are?
Thank you. This is a lot of info coming at the right time.
Are “Organic” sunscreen also referred to as “Mineral” sunscreens?
thank you so much!!!! always great info!
Maybe we should all live like vampires, sleep during the day and do our business at night.
Never in my life have I seen such a thorough and clear explanation of sunscreen use. You are the BOMB!!!!!
I was so pleasantly surprised by Paula's Choice Extra Care SPF 50 (https://www.paulaschoice.com/extra-care-non-greasy-sunscreen-spf-50/232.html). I hadn't realized it was intended for the body as well, or I would not have tried it on my face. Very, very glad I did. It's a lovely formula esp'ly if you have oily skin. It's 3% avobenzone.
Love your videos! Thanks!
Well, so when I apply powder on top of the sunscreen it decrease the strength of protection?!
this video is amazing! <3
Great video! But what about mixing sunscreen with a loose mineral foundation? Does this decrease the protection significantly as well?
Can’t put sunscreen in my makeup. Can I put it in my lotion/moisturizer ? Or is that the same concept as the makeup
Very informative video, thank you! :)
Can I mix a little foundation into my sunscreen so I don’t get a white cast? Or should I layer them
Fantastic video, learned so much. Thank you!
This is so informative! Thank you!
Thank you. I really needed this. You literally answered every spf question I have ever had! Have you tried the brand Ultrasun? They claim that you must apply on drybskin, BEFORE your skincare. Apparently the formula allows your skincare ingredients to penetrate. However, I find this psychologically impossible to believe, so I put it on top of my Hada Labo Perfect Cream Gel/Cerave Lotion! Hopefully it’s still effective! They also claim that you only need to apply it once and it won’t need topping up. Would be interested in your thoughts on this! Thanks x
What if I left my Sunscreen bottle in the sun by accident for 12 hours? It is the la Roche Posey tinted one.
Finally, a beauty influencer that actually talks science.
Does anyone know if I can apply a thin layer of Aquaphor on top of sunscreen without compromising the SPF??
Im so glad, ive been doing it the right way..🤗🤗🤗THANK YOU SO MUCH, SUCH AN INFORMATIVE CHANNEL
How do i find out which sunscreen ingredients (if any) are not compatible with each other?
Garnier SPF50 face spray.
Japan has a standard of pa++++ does this make your math different as the standard in Japan states the protection is 16+ which I don't understand
So I take a glutathione, I know it reduces melanin production does this mean I'm more prone to UV damage quicker than if i didn't?
What are your favourite sunscreens to use under makeup?
This is the best video about sunscreen and makeup. You've gave answer to all the tricky questions. Thank you so much!
So helpful!
I like the neutrogena hydro boost sunscreen 😊
Can you mix foundation with your moisturizer under sunscreen?
Hey guys do you have any recommendations on rub resistant sunscreen? Cannot find one using google...thank you!
If I have a sunscreen serum, would it go before or after my moisturizer????
I've been looking for a video like this for years and I can't believe I finally found it 😭😭😭😭😭😭 THANK YOU!!!!!
Do moisturizers such as Josie maran with spf actually provide protection? Or is it the situation where you would need a table spoon quantity to actually get accurate coverage and no one puts that much on?
This is the first time ever learning not to layer avobenzone with octinoxate, zinc oxide or titanium dioxide! Thank you so much!!
My skin is super sensitive and sunscreen aggravates my rosacea so I only use it when I go out. 😥
Excellent thank you.🌸👍🏻💖
What about a powder sunscreen?
I keep on wondering about spray-on sunscreens. I wear spf50 when I go out, but I am not able to over-apply on my make-up. You mentioned spray sunscreens briefly, but would they actually work over make-up? How about different kinds, i.e. regular spray and aerosol? I feel like aerozol is least likely to disrupt the make-up, but is it actually effective?  Also, now that I'm thinking, do you wear sunscreen if you're not leaving home? I personally don't, bur after watching your video, I think I'm gonna look for spf day cream at least for summer.  Oh, and one more thing...in your other spf video you mention spf100 - I am uneasy about it. I have used one before and it kept me wondering is spf this high actually possible or am I just overpaying for a gimmick, since it's weird that very few brands make it given that the possibility exists...🤔 what do you think?
What if a sunscreen has avobenzone with octinoxate and titanium dioxide?
Hello dear which sunscreen is the best in Uk ???? Plz help to choose best one .
I appreciate your videos very much. I learn a lot. I have used the It Cosmetics SPF 50 CC cream for years. I now use a separate 50 spf. Will you please check out and review It Cosmetics BB and CC cream? I would love to hear what you think. Thx ;)
so what happens if i set my sunscreen with a setting spray and then apply makeup on top?
Thank you for the information! I literally consider your channel the last word in science and beauty intersectionality.
It would be really cool if you could do "healthy" skincare routines and make up tutorials!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I LOVE your channel!!! I am a skin care fanatic and makeup lover with rosacea, hyperhidrosis, and combo skin. I'm guessing you can imagine how frustrating that can be. I easily react to most organic sunscreens, and it has been difficult enough to find an inorganic sunscreen that is sweat resistant. I avoid the sun as much as possible, but I don't have much control over the sweating. 😕 Your foundation clumping video is so helpful! You've given me some new things to try! So excited to watch your other videos!
I have a question about the first study. How did the group who didn't wear sunscreen age after 4.5  years?
i can't believe i'm just now discovering your channel and so glad someone is presenting beauty and health with science instead of being led by trends and fads. you mentioned you prefer newer chemical sunscreen not available yet in the US, can you name your favorites and why? Thank you!
Very gOod video
Your videos are great! Love them. I am 42 years old and really struggle with dry skin. My make up often look patchy because my skin is too dry. I have tried many creams, but would love it if you could make a video with products that work well together on dry skin( moisturizer, SPF, primer, makeup foundation) I am lost. Help!
What about powdered sunscreens? Like colorscience or peter Thomas Roth? These are great for going on top of your makeup and are easy to reapply without messing it up. Are they effective?
Is it okay to mix just a teeny amount of concealer/foundation to your sunscreen to make a tinted sunscreen? Or will this make your sunscreen slide around your face?
Can I use a mineral sunscreen and the apply a foundation with octinoxate?
I am a science teacher. Most of the beauty videos on YouTube are not actually accurate when you reason it with science. I found your Chanel accidently and so happy.... finally found what I wanted
How about lips? Do you wear the same sunscreen both on your face and lips? I've tried a few lip products with spf but they're not pleasant at all.
Awesome
Zinc Oxide is actually excellent for UVA protection.
Just found out about this channel and I'm loving it! Any recommendations of non oily spray sunscreens or good powders? Thanks for the great videos!
Hi, after how long the sun exposure can cause aging damage on the skin? I have lived in Australia for 2 years and worn sunscreen most of sunny days but there has been several exceptions and I didn't wear it on my arms, and body. Are the damages already done?
I wear it daily during summer but sunscreen is just DISGUSTING on the skin. I've tried oil free, gels, mattyfying all the consistencies. It doesn't matter. It's gross and I hate it.
Could you mix your foundation with your moisturiser instead of with the sunscreen?
I have rosacea and wear heavy duty sunscreen daily, should I double cleanse?
THANK YOU! the reapplication question has always been a vexing one for me, so I appreciate the clear and concise explanation.
This seems to be an unpopular opinion here but advising ANYONE that they need not to apply an SPF is spreading misinformation. Regardless of susceptibility to skin cancer or cosmetic preference, everyone should wear and reapply an SPF every day. Also, referring to physical sunscreen as organic is misleading because a physical sunscreen can include zinc oxide but have other ingredients that are not organic. You should have referred to sunscreen as physical and chemical instead. If you want good, medically-backed advice regarding SPF and skincare in general, consider visiting Dr. Drey's channel.
what if my moisturize has spf? can i mix it with my sunscreen? im using physical suncreen, the only one which wont irritate my skin
Great tips! I have a question for you. If I use a daily mosturiser with SPF, and I don't wear makeup, do I need to reapply sun protection during the day? and if yes do I need to apply a sunscreen without moisturiser so my skin doesn't get oily? On my daily moisturiser with SPF, it says that it should be applied "often" to get full protection, but since it is a daily moisturiser, that would make my skin too moisturised right? You mention that you reapply SPF powder or spray, I haven't heard of SPF powder before, what is that? and what do you mean by SPF spray? is that just normal sunscreen of something else? (for my sun situation I live in Denmark where the weather is often cloudy, and I often stay inside most of the day, but I have sun sensitive pale skin, and is afraid of developing skin cancer, so I care about SPF).
I still have a doubt, should I apply my sunscreen before or after my foundation? My makeup is spf 15 but I like to wear sunscreen as well ):
It would be great if you could demonstrate the technique on your face
Hi Michelle! I like your blush here, looks more natural.  Of course, I'm stoked with your content.  Could you talk about skincare for menopausal women? Thanks in advance and looking forward to your next video! :)  - Amy M., Secondary Education (major: Chemistry)
Can we use spf moisturizer during the night time routine?
Hi, can I use a primer on my T zone after sunscreen? And them apply makeup?
what are your thoughts on spray on sunscreen for your face? Like lancaster sun sport spray?
You are the best youtuber ever! So if we use an antioxidant serum (like Niod's survival 0) before our sunscreen, the film of our sunscreen is compromised and its effectiveness too, since it contains some silicones that remain on the skin?
So   We dont need to use primer afeter the sun cream
I've watched numerous videos on sunscreen and this is the best! Great job :)
Thank you so much for your vlogs!!!  Can you please clarify the effects of Alcohol Denat in sunscreen.  Most Asian sunscreens or sunscreens with tinosorb contains alcohol.  I understand it is used to help the product to be more effective. But since alcohol denat thins the skin which can lead to aging of the skin, is it a smart choice?  There are so many sunscreens on the market and  so much conflicting information, it can be confusing. I am currently using Babo naturals spf 30 but it contains sunflower and rosehip oil, which I understand degrades, so that is also a concern.  It seems like physical sunscreens contain alcohol, and mineral sunscreens contain oils.  Thank you :)
I still feel kinda paranoid about applying makeup on top of sunscreen. I use the Maybelline liquid foundation and I wait 15 minutes for the susncreen to dry. Then I would use a sponge to pat it on. Wouldn't the sponge absorb the sunscreen? Or will it mostly remain in tact since I waited the 15 minutes? I hear more people concerned about messing up their makeup but not so much messing up the susncreen. I know you addressed this point in your video but I always wonder whether or not I'm rubbing it off. Thank you! :)
Would applying powder makeup with a brush disrupt sunscreen more than lightly patting on liquid foundation?  I use Bareminerals so I buff it into my skin but I'm wondering this would smear the sunscreen around a lot even if you wait 8 minutes for SPF to dry.
Hi Michelle, what a great video, full of practical and scientifically proved information about how to apply sunscreen properly, ¡Congratulations!, this is the type of content we need on youtube.Thank you very much😄👏
Hi Michelle, is it necessary to use makeup remover to get rid of the sunscreens at day end if I’m not wearing any makeup?
Your videos are so great- So informative. I have question: I wear a mix of oils on my face in lieu of a traditional moisturizer, is using a facial oil first and then applying my sunscreen ok? My facial oil contains (grapeseed oil, jojoba oil, camellia seed oil, frankincense eo, rosehip eo) thanks!
I've been using Biore, and always forgot to reapplay sunscreen. Can I apply extra sunscreen( more than 2mg ) to get higher spf, so that I can reapplay less.
As I heard that Vitamin C is helpful to keep sunscreen more stable and longer lasting, while the others said that Vitamin C is photosensitive and make skin damaged when using in daytime. So which is correct? Now I'm still using Vitamin C in daytime with sunscreen spf 50. I would like to have your advise about this. Thank you very much!!
New to your channel and loving your videos.... Your voice is soothing -- sounds like those pre programmed voice applications...
Thank you for this valuable information! xo
WTF, Is this supposed to be chemistry class and not make up tutorial???
Michelle, thank you for your informative videos. I have a question I was wondering if you could answer.  Oils have been incorporated into many people's skincare routine and therefore, it's very difficult to determine how to layer facial oils and sunscreen together. Would you have any suggestions on how to do so without compromising the integrity and efficacy of the sunscreen?  Thank you in advance.
Elta MD has zinc plus OCTINOXATE . Is this effective?
AWESOME VIDEO CONGRATS
I think I’m one of those who cannot use sunscreen everyday because physical ones dry my skin and chemicals break me out :( and I’ve tried seveeeeveral! I don’t and can’t waste more money on that.
This was very informative, but could easily have been broken down into several videos 🎬
You are the bomb!
You are one of the only well educated people on Youtube making videos about skincare. I can't thank you enough for your work. All these skincare "gurus" are useless.
It'd be great if you do video talking about sunglasses and the differences in quality and  sun protection according to the price :)
hello! what about barrier creams? should i put them before or after sunscreen?
This video is very informative and easy to understand. Thanks for doing it! But I'm thinking: wouldn't a damp Beauty Blender affect my sunscreen? I personally apply foundation with a cushion (20+ min after sunscreen). With some foundations, it would be easier to apply with BB but I'm too afraid I'll mess up all that previous work.
I have a question. Is this ingredient "ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate" safe for use? on the EWG's site, it claims to be a hormone disruptor etc. I found this ingredient in my sunscreen and the hourglass vanish stick foundation which I intend to buy. please guide me. PS I came here after Liah Yoo + your video collab. Thank youuuu =)
Thank-you for this great video! I'm just wondering what the best way to apply moisturiser with SPF - should I pat it on and wait for the white film to set or do I rub it in like I would do with a normal moisturiser? I'm also experiencing difficulties finding a sunscreen/moisturiser with SPF that doesn't irritate my eyes; is sunscreen not supposed to be applied around the eye area?
How about using serum under the sunscreen?  I used the niacinamide ones
This video is so informative and well documented! I love this channel! Thank you for taking the time to make these videos :) .  I have a couple of questions: I didn't know that organic sunscreens offer a higher UVA protection than inorganic sunscreens. I use a 20% zinc oxide spf 40 sunscreen, and I thought zinc oxide is a very good UVA protectant. Do you think I would get a higher UVA protection from a organic sunscreen, for example a PA+++ one? How can I know more or less the PA level of my sunscreen, the one with 20% zinc oxide?   And also, I still need to check you blog, but, do you have any blog post on UPF protective clothing? Hope you can answer me. Thank you very much!
I am so thrilled to have found you on You Tube! Thank you for all your research and explanation on a topic I have always struggled with. I am a fellow Aussie living in Texas where many prefer sun baking vs slip, slop, slap method of protection! I’m looking forward to binging on your existing and future videos! Thanks again!
Have you heard about EVY Sun Mousse? I would love to know what you think of it :)  If you've never tried it, I can strongly recommend it, it's my all time favorite. It's not sticky or smelly, doesn't rub off easily, only needs to be reapplied after 6 hours and doesn't wash off when you swim. It doesn't give me zits either, but leaves my skin feeling smooth and nice ^^   At first I thought it was fake, because a sun screen can't do all those things, it's too good to be true, haha. But it really works.
Too many permutations and combinations to apply sunscreen
Your videos are a well of information! Thank you! I always wanted to know more facts about how these things work. I am very glad I found you channel and will be sharing it with my friends!
I just stumbled on your channel. You’re knowledgeable and share many greet topics! You mention that skincare can age you. Can you do a video detailing this topic?
What do you make of the claims that homosalate and octyl methoxycinnamate/octinoxate are hormone disruptors? I have also read that octinoxate interacts with zinc oxide so that they become less photostable. I did not read these in scientific articles so I am unsure if I SHOULD take these claims seriously. But out of fear i have been using zinc oxide sunscreens every day and live a ghost life haha
This answered so many of my questions! Thanks for sharing all of your knowledge + making it easy to follow! I would love to see a video on skincare/makeup ingredients (and all the different science-y names they go by) to avoid.
Currently I am using an SPF 35 sunscreen with 3% avobenzone and use a cushion foundation with titanium dioxide and zinc oxide. Does this mean that the sunscreen would be cancelled out?
Thank god I watched this video. I got a matte moisturizer along with a super matte sunscreen and foundation ; & I got so frustrated with them since they're good on their own but together they're too drying on my skin. I was thinking of using garnier bb cream on top of the matte sunscreens I have, is that okay?
I use oil (first acids and than marula oil)  before spf50 is it still protect my skin? Thank you!
i'm pissed no one told me about the importance of wearing sun tan lotion, my parents even insisted that sun would do my skin good 😤
Hi Michelle,  I normally use Argirelene, Resveratrol+Ferulic Acid and Vitamin C in silicone (all from The Ordinary) under my sunscreen. Do you think it might impact the effectiveness of my sunscreen?  Thank you very much. LOVE your channel and blog!
This is so awesome and helpful. I need to rethink my sunscreen choice because I do not apply a good enough amount. Yikes. And you are beautiful and have such a wonderful voice!
After watching this video coincidentally, it's so nice and reassuring to know I've been doing what you said in this video! And sorry for "talking" so much but I have to add I love how well you explain and get information across! Absolutely amazing, so glad I found you from LiahYoo's channel!! Xx again you are gorgeous too! #dying
May I ask you why ethnicity you are?
I am so happy I found your channel and videos btw you're so pretty :O
hello ma'am ..ur vedios  are worth watching..u nicely explain science behind beauty..i got white patches on my chicks area and sun tan all over my face due to sun as i I am from india ..and in india summer are its peak ..extreme  heat...even i apply sunscreen that didn't work..plz suggest
Urgh just so much new information. I am so thrilled now. Thanks for researching scientific resources and putting them all in this wonderful video. I saved this video. I definitely will watch it again for thorough understanding 😀
Michelle, another FAB video.  Would be so helpful to know what sunscreen products you recommend, given your expertise!  Also re: reapplying sunscreen post makeup throughout the day, have you (or anyone reading this) tried the Dr. Dennis Gross Sheer Mineral Sun Spray Broad Spectrum SPF 50+ (https://goo.gl/jDHsA6), the Coola Suncare Suncare Green Tea and Aloe Makeup Setting Spray SPF 30 (https://goo.gl/zVqm2M) or Supergoop!'s SPF 50 Defense Refresh Setting Mist Sunscreen (https://goo.gl/K1sq4U)?  Sounds like the Dr. Dennis Gross one works well over makeup!
Hi, I recently found your blog and fell in love with it! I has a question that I was wondering if you can answer.   When it comes to waterproof make up products such as Mascara, they are typically made up of waxes, or more fat based products correct? Assuming other things are mixed in, but based on the principle of like dissolves like. However, my understanding is that fatty acids have a lower melting point than hydrophillic substances. So are water proof mascara more prone to smudging when it comes to being exposed to our high body temperatures compared to non water proof formulas? Thanks, and I hope you can answer my question! :)
This was so informative! I wish more youtubers were concerned with sun protection. Awesome video!!
Related to the first question, do i need to wear sunscreen on days that i'm indoors literally all day? Because I work from home, and i keep the blinds closed/don't sit near any windows. I definitely wear it if i drive somewhere or go out, of course.
So glad you're doing videos these day. A beauty guru with a relevant PhD is amazing!
Great video! Really answered my questions and inspired me to keep making sure I use daily SPF!
Thanks so much for taking the time to cover all these issues: amazing video! Keep up the amazing work 💕
Excellent and very useful video again! Great job!
Thank you! I've been waiting for a video like this for a long time. Quick question: can the Coola or Goop makeup setting sprays work for reapplying a bit of spf over makeup? I wear spf 50 under makeup (about 1/4 tsp) but as I wear a full face every day (MUA- can't work my way around that one) I need something I can reapply over foundation et al easily. xoxo
Great video as always!
Really amazing . The best video i have ever watched about sunscreen. Really understandable and beutiful expression. You are perfect , please keep making videos . World needs them !!!!!!
Fantastic video!! Everybody should learn this <3
Just wondering does it affect the sunscreen if you put on setting spray???
This is very detailed and thorough explanation about sunscreens! Thank you for thisvideo! 💕
You are my hero! I have another question for you; why are some products with the exact same number of actives listed at varying levels of SPF? For example, I've seen products rated SPF 30 and SPF 50 both using 20% Zinc Oxide. Does the formula itself dilute the ability of the active to perform? For example, if one of these products contain more oil ingredients, or if one is more "water-resistant." Thanks for your help or insight on this!
Wow thank you so much! Super helpful!
Fantastic information! Thank you.
Thank you for this! Great video and very thorough.  I love that more cosmetic products have spf in them now.  I'm also using more of the mexoryl and tinosorb sunscreens, especially when I'll be receiving more exposure.  Too bad they're so hard to get in the U.S. still.
I'm photosensitive due to an autoimmune disease, and some of the medications I take for said disease also cause photosensitivity. This was invaluable for me, thank you!
I'm addicted to this vids!
Excellent video and I'm an Esthetician! Absolutely love this. You're my kind of girl. I know what it is to take complicated information, simplify it and then present it in a manner that you hope people get it (understand it).  The process is real Lol. Love your dedication and it's very much appreciated 🙌🏾
your videos are such a breath of fresh air. you dont know how tired i am of hearing "chemical sunscreens need to be absorbed into the skin but physical works immediately" or "chemical sunscreens absorb and physical reflect" 😑
This is immensely useful, thank you! I really appreciate the effort you put into making these videos, as well as blog posts. You deserve a cape ^^
Most informative suncreen guide that I had read 🖒
Another great video, I'm so thankful to have discovered a skin care blogger that actually bases their information and opinions on scientific studies and even refer to them for us to see 😭❤ All the questions brought up in this video were so interesting and helpful as well. Is there any way to support all your hard work to make all this available to us? Would love to help in any way, be it monthly donations on Patreon or whatever. Keep up the amazing work 💕😍😊
just one more if I may :-D !!!  It's not that I am a huge fan of la roche or something. In fact I only have one of their sunscreens for the face for high protection when really aktive outside and I had a soothing cream, but I noticed that they have a daycream for normal to dry skin with spf50 with protection up to 8 h min. I asked the pharmacist about it, if it really would hold and if re-application would not be needed. she said, it states 50 but in fact it would contain an spf of about 100. the realized benefit for the skin would rathe be the spf50 esp when calculated for more hours. that is, why it states only the 50 and it doesn't need to be re-applied when used as day cream, because of the substances.... I think it might be a mineral sunscreen. I didn't look it up thoroughly because I realized as a person with combo or oily skin, there is no daycream that would go higher with the spf than 30 max. I realized myself, that it is difficult to use without having break ups. but I wonder - next sommer, if I would put on a day cream for combo skin with spf 30 in the morning at 7h planning to go to the pool with friends about 4 p.m. and half an hour before I go outside I would put on my regular sunscreen for beach etc that I have esp. for sensitive face or even, if I would use a regular sunscreen for my hole body, would it be correct/effective that way?
is the skincare - sunscreen - makeup order always right? this sommer I read a lot about sunscreen because I tend to sun allergy and I want the protection because of redness on my cheeks. that I already reduced now and I want it to stay reduced.so one of things was, that the first product with spf you put on your skin gives the skin the information to build up a sun/uv defending mechanism in the body itself. and the intensity of that effort will be somehow 'defined' by the spf one puts on the skin. so if the first sunscreen has spf 15 or 20 and your second layer is spf30 or 50, the body will still try to adjust to the first spf factor it senses on the skin. (might refer to chemical sunscreen. I am not so firm about mineral sunscreen yet.) also sunprotection mechanism of the body will be stimulated for about 1,5 or 2 hours then you have to reapply. if you would re-apply e.g. 3, 5 or 8 hours later, the skin will not be able to hold the level and also will not simulated to build up the uv protection you need. only about 24 hours later it would be ready to build up again.  (again - may only be an issue regarding chemical sunscreen. mineral sunscreen might depend much more on how it wears of e.g. at the beach or in the city when one does sweat a lot too...?)  so what was my question? ah yes, if my skincare has spf 15 or 30 incorporated (e.g. one of LaRoche Posey daycream for como skin with SPF 30 / or a CC cream from clinique for daycream use only not for sunbath or intense exposure!!) and if I would want some extra protection on nose and cheeks with spr 50 then it would not work, if I would put on an spf 15 first. I should put on the spf50 first and then the daycream. that is what I thought, now I wonder, if that is correct.   could you please go into this again and maybe show us some examples of combination? e.g. daycream - extra sunscrean for everyday (e.g. mild climate or even winter), then in the hot sommer, when after work one would like to be outside - in the city... and how to prepare a skin if one first goes to the office and later in the afternoon directy to the beach or whatever to be more exposed..... what kind of creams with spf in it can be combined with what kind of sunscreen better?   things like that? maybe divided in a serie?
thanks!
Apparently timestamps in the description don't always work on mobile, but they do in the comments! Here you go:  0:08 Do I need to wear sunscreen every day, even though I'll be inside most of the time? 1:35 Do I need a separate sunscreen if my make-up has SPF? 3:08 What happens when I layer multiple products with SPF? 4:21 Can I mix sunscreen into my make-up? 4:47 Is chemical or physical sunscreen better? (* should say LESS allergies for physical) 6:07 Do I need to apply chemical and physical sunscreens differently? 6:59 What order should I apply my products in? 8:30 How should I apply my products so I don't mess up my sunscreen? 11:02 How can I stop sunscreen from balling up? 12:08 How do I look less shiny? How can I get rid of the oil? 13:01 Do I need to reapply sunscreen? How do I reapply sunscreen with make-up on?
I feel so much smarter after watching your videos! Thanks for the useful information as usual - wish you would upload more often!!
OH NO, MY MOISTURISER IS PACKED WITH FATS AND I MIXED IT WITH OIL STILL!!!
Thanks for this. I've been applying oil under sunscreen in place of a moisturizer. Not a good idea after all. 😭
Thank you for that wonderful video! You managed to answer all my spf questions in one video. Love your content!
Honestly, thank youu
Fabulous as usual girl!!!! Love all the science behind your vlogs. :)  this info would apply to us up here in the frozen north as we head into winter.  There is a lot of reflection of the sun off the snow on a sunny day so sunscreen in winter is crucial.
This is an amazing video, and answered all of the questions I didn't even know that I had, thank you!
Very very clear and such useful information! I find combining sunscreen into my skincare and makeup routine so confusing but this video has helped enormously! Thankyou!
I really need this video, because of my eltamd is not mixing well with my makeup because of the balls! I'll try this changes, thank youu
Very clear and helpful, as usual.  Thank you!
