Excuse me ma'am but this is not Halva. This is -kalom Prama- originally from Cyprus, even he is not doing it correctly. The Greek Halva is a dessert made with sesame paste (except in Argentina where peanut paste is used), Italian meringue and honey in nougat format. Excuse my broken English, greetings from Argentina.
4 tablespoons of baking powder? Is that correct?
would I add the rind of the lemon with the sauce or with the mixture
wait what happened to the lemon rind??
