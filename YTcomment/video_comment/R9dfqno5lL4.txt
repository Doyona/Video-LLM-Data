And the guac?
His eyebrows are on a different level
He looks like he isnt on the sauce stay sober
Nice video! Where is the perfect nacho part of it?
could there be anymore plastic bags? </chandler>
legend
Looks like very cold nachos 😂😂
Never since HowToBasic did I think that I’d be intentionally watching a video on how to make nachos...  ...but I suppose anything times 100 is impressive 👌
Im 8 feet tall and that is not 8 feet
Why is this the last one?
100 people ?
More like 100 starving ppl in Africa
97 cans of beans?
That wouldn’t feed me and 10 friends 😂😂
Did he forget the melted cheese?!
Lame
So. Much. Plastic.
Those onions shine brighter than my life
Thinking of what to do this weekend? What about checking out the latest food hall in New York City focusing on selling everything Japanese. Big Eataly-like food hall called "Japan Village" that opened up in Brooklyn this past weekend. Let me take you on a tour with me (clip also available in Mandarin and Cantonese). Link: https://youtu.be/0vXRrx4fDPc
right?
Wtf this guy has more personality than your other hosts
People in New York can’t texmex
First        Hokage was hashirama
Should have served it with spatulas Cliff
PLEASE DONT GO CLIFF
Salt always before water bath
100 ppl? Or 1 really sad and lonely individual
Literally the only reason I subscribed to this channel.
Damn cliff takes nachos so seriously. I respect it.
maybe if i had 100 friends but its a 1 person party
why is he dressed  like a European farmer from 1940
100? ONE HUNDRED??🤣🤣 my ass.
Now THAT S a chef!
Weres he going
Looks like a good snack. What are you making for the other 99 people?
click bait and a half... lmao
Hope we will see you around Cliff, you are amazing!
Loved it
i could eat all of these in one sitting
well, unsubbing from this otherwise shitty channel. he was pretty much the only reason to watch.
Hey Cliff you are leaving Eater, Men the time i Subcribed this channel was for you I loved the way you make videos funny making my day awesome, you dammend traitor i will miss your videos and i wish you luck in everything you are making now
more like a medium raw steak
Where can I find that torch
2/2 blowtorch moment <3
Way to sign off!
NO! Cliff you cant leave!!! What are we going to do without you?!?!? Who is going to over complicate food now?!?!
the hipster levels with this channel making it almost unwatchable
Nooooo! :(
wait so the show got cancelled??‽
I'm gonna miss Cliff😥
This looks soooooo freakin  good, but Bruh where's the guac?!?!?
All aboard the chef train to Sousvideville 🚂
Mushy texture after sous vide sounds more like an improper sear than anything else, though, no?
That whole thing can be eaten by me...
Oh my gout
I miss Nick Solares
So sodium citrate thickens/gives body?
Man this guy looks super unhealthy, I think he drinks way too much.
thanks cliff, miss you already
Wow cliff is out and so is Lucas 😔, what happened to you eater....
Woah! Where did this "end" come from? What's Cliff's next show? I don't need the internet if you Cliff doesn't have another show.
Salsa? Guacamole?
Cliff, you will be missed! Can't wait to see what your up to next :)
noooo why is it the last??
That's not going to feed 100 people. max 5 drunk people.
What about the cheese sauce
I wanna swan dive into that.
I saw you upload that omakase vid eater! I needs it...
Giving the people what they want @Clifford Endo
You can tell he’s actually passionate about what he does I love that.
Cliff is the best part of this channel
NOOOOOOO
Way way to damn red!!! That’s really unhealthy maybe really good for your taste buds but that red meat that rare is so bad for your body to tear down. Don’t believe me look it up. I  Guarantee your  Intestines intestinal track kidney etc. are not gonna like it
So I cant do this anymore?
I would eat that all by myself.
Damn this was the reason I subbed to this channel
idk why but i dont like the way he talk feels boring
I am so happy you finally leave. The outfit in this instalment shows what a pretentious fat slob you are. Please never come back.
I thought NO2 was extremely toxic I might need to research this more
You  forgot the cheese sauce
🤢🤮 not approved
Oh no Cliff :( will you have a channel of your own? You're the reason I started following Eater. You will be missed :( good luck in your other adventures
*tsssssssss* one for me *tsssssss* one for the cream
That was underwhelming
The last one?! I just started watching this show!
Cliff my friend wer u going?
See yah Cliff, thanks for everything it has been fun!
"Carbon Dioxide is bubbles" - so is any dissolved gas, like nitrous. The whipped cream that is usually made has bubbles.
NOOOOO CLIFF!!!! Please tell us you’re coming back in another show. ☹️☹️☹️
Damn Cliff. Hope u return to somewhere soon
Where you go I go I'll be loooooooking!for you dude
What a waste of food
Damn Cliff and Lucas are gone. gonna really miss those two but excited to see what both of 'em and Eater have got cooking (wink) in the kitchen (double wink). I also have a feeling that K-Town is heading out the way too
This guy seems awesome! Nice style and personality.
This man is an absolute legend for cooking in a jean jacket
I really enjoyed video s cliff does. Hope to see in future he work.
I watched these just for cliff!
Damn Cliff was so entertaining to watch. Always made me hungry
Gonna miss u
What are you moving onto Cliff? @cliffordendo
Well, we lost Lucas and now Cliff. Hope Prime Time doesn't go anywhere soon as that's the only thing left that I watch
Pad the steak dry before you season and sear it. Dont do what this guy did
wayyyyyy too much oil to get a real crust
Munchies pulling the old EA move by buying out properties lmao or in this case hosts
Vice needed to pick up some talent after they lost some key figures. This was a good pickup  for them, hope it works out.
Wow thought he was going to paint a picture...
Where ya goin?
Cheese didn't melt
Don’t go, cliff!
That's RAW
Cliff, where ya going?
Will someone tell me why this is the last episode? Whats going on Cliff?
that jacket is screaming for help :D
Looking forward to new content from you Cliff
Why the hell did you ruin it with cilantro? Might as well have just poured dish soap all over the nachos.
Love the outfit!!!    Not surprised it is the last since Eater commenters out of the food channels are quite mean and often attack the show hosts. But I am excited for the new content Eater will bring, we lost Lucas and others but hope we get a refresh of series on this channel. I enjoy Eater and the show was fun.
Ahhhhh man. Sorry to see you go dude
Why he dressed like 1970’s-era Orson Wells
Very nice, but where did the cheese sauce go?
Ruined
I just saw nachos and I clicked. Wait. What?!? Last episode??? What??????
Whered the cheese sauce go???
Gonna miss you, you lovely weirdo
8:02 Pro Tip: Dry the meat before searing.
OH NO MAN I LOVE THIS SHOW
3:31 It's literally the opposite.
Oh, I'll miss him!
What?!?!   Like, last for.. this season? Then, the next one will start?? Right?
Its the ultra fat Homer, he even wears the hat!!
NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!! I’m literally crying!!!!!! 😭😭😭😭. You can do this is the reason I subscribed to Eater. I love your videos, Cliff, and I think I speak for us all when I say that we’ll miss you, man.
You people are stupid!!!! Now it’s obvious you have a something physically wrong  Nachos for a crowd of a 100 or more Is a sign of overcompensating in the Worst Way !!!!!!!!!!!
Whip it good !!!!
No ,please don't go ...😲😭
Oh man, sad to see you leave! But thanks for all the cool videos! 🤗
Echale  queso Juanita homi!
Good job, Cliff!
those aren't near enough to feed 100 people
Wtf so sad why must this be the last
I hope ill be seeing you over at vice
Chefista for cooking .. Delicious recipes !!
last? Oh no!
sry to see you go, you are my fav. Hope you´ll have a great life
😢 first Lucas, now you! 😭
You can do this!  >sous vide for nachos
nice bruiser n all ' BUT esther is so much prettier    !!!
Great series! Much love and good food.
huh? Only chillis and salt go into the pressure chamber, where's the sugar and liquid? I'm thinking something got lost in the edit here.
Vice is gonna chew you up and spit you out, but i'll still be a fan.
Ch allenge accepted!
That was not perfect nachos for 100 people... Sorry but this needs to be done over again...
I've really enjoyed this show and am sad to see it end. Good luck to Cliff, I'm looking forward to seeing what he makes next.
how and why u turn n2 the grinch tho 2:14
I don't know why but at 2:15 his expression reminds me  Jack Nicholson
The acctual reason why i subbed to eater was cause of u and now youre leaving :,(.... your videos always made my day and im so sad to see u leave this channel but either way i wish u the best in ur endeavourse clifford
maybe that is what Elon Musk's Not A Flamethrower is for 10:31
Sous vide everything might disagree on the salt before vidin' the sous......
Where is he going? France? Lol kidding
*Just buy Tostitos*
Wasn't a fan of Cliff. He just doesn't have on-screen charisma.
good bye sweet prince
100 people my butt. Nice vid tho
Damnit, Cliff.  Gonna miss ya, mate.
Bye Cliff :/
That’d feed about twenty of my friends... looked good!
Needs more jalapeno. You can never have enough jalapeno.
Bye Cliff 😭😭😭
But he's my favorite 😭☹😢!
your shirts too tight bruh
Great series.  You will be missed.
Currently: Producer @ Munchies/Vice. Formerly: Eater, Food Network & Travel Channel.
Hey you spread those nachos thin buster!!!!
Haha we have trouble making food episodes for 2!!!! This is awesome!!!!
I hate the whole idea of nachos....love nachos but hate how they are put together....who the fuck likes soggy ass nachos? The more shit u pile on the harder it is to actually get a whole nacho with everything on it in ur mouth cleanly....I rather u just have everything separated and then u combine as u go
Last episode of this season? Yeah?
Last one?
I waste the wip cream but never the gas
Wait the LAST ONE 😭😭
Why is this the last one?
first
