You just dry the fruit and now you leave it open and seal after 5 days so what about the moisture in the air🤔 it's it the best to seal it after it cool down after a few mins
How long did you dry it using the oven?
I am going to make this with grapes  they taste AWESOME
Just a question, can you make tea out of this? :p
Thank You!
Dude, this is fantastic. I'm gonna dry the fruit so I can make a vinegar out of it, and then pickle all kinds of different things. I can't wait to get into this.
Hii

I visited the website but couldn’t find the recipe. 😢
Nice wow
Freeze-dried fruits and vegetables are available on the domestic market in many countries, and this is also true here in Japan. However, there is a difference between Japan and other countries. Surprisingly, Japan has perfected dried fruits and vegetables using naturally grown fruits and vegetables, which can be easily restored to their original state by soaking them in a small amount of water, with no loss of taste or mouthfeel because the cells have not been destroyed. Moreover, the cells are not destroyed, so the taste and mouthfeel are not lost at all. Moreover, they can be long stored for two to three years, and are expected to help the food insecure people in the not-too-distant future 🍋🍊🥝 💪
Can we use these to make those expensive tea blends ?
I’m gonna make this with apple cucumber and carrots and I’m gonna use them as treats for my mice!! They will love this
