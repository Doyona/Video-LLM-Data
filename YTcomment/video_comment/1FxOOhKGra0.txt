I don't understand why my flowers turned green/brown recently 😕 I was hoping this video would enlighten me as to what I did wrong.   I used melt and pour with rose petals and it looked pretty to start.   I bagged them up and tied them with string and two days later they looked like they'd gone bad.   I thought maybe you can't add dried flowers, but maybe it's the melt and pour or maybe it's something else.  I'm brand new to all of this and these videos are already so helpful thank-you.   Any insight would be helpful from anyone who's done this before.   I wish I could add photos cuz I have before/afterwards...
Do they discolour with time?
LOVE your bubbly personality!!
The Great 2020 Rewatch continues onward :) I'm pretty sure this was the first of your soaps that I well and truly fell in love with
wow the flower powders made it DARK i'm glad you used a matching fragrance to the flowers you put in
Was curious if it would be ok to ship melt and pour soaps?
How can I determine the use of soaps with petals? I previously thought they were for scrubby handwashing but now feel unsure.
Can you say the soap detoxifies without creating a potential legal issue?
I have seen people spraying their soap with 99% alcohol to prevent soda ash on top. Does it have to be 99%? That is impossible to find right now. Would everclear work?
Thanks for keeping it kid friendly! Why not? Wash their mouth out with soap! Lol! Gag! I could never I would end up getting nauseous! Seriously your funny, I can see my daughters enjoying your presentation comments while u make soap! This year we planted edible flowers to add to our salad.. but may for our soap now. Can we use herbal tea from the store for the soap? Any contradictions like additives? Thanks for the share! I was looking for cellulite removal soap to make.. and found your channel.. I'm just a crafter not commercial soap maker.
hI!!!! i just wanna to know how i can make the soap that it doesen´t ruin when adding dried flowers. I have tried it before, but it always ruins my soap because the flower even when dried, (2 months dried) discolor all over the soap. :( :( help!!!
Vanilla Lavender Buds keep their Purple Flowers.
Can you put the flowers on the bottom of the mold?
How do you heat your oils when you’re doing such large batches?
I waaaaant this soap
OMG...those botanical flowers are gorgeous!!  Would you share your EO blend recipe, too?  I'm always confused what goes good together...
you seem to be REALLY close with your mom, it’s so sweet
Yeah - those Lavender buds are not very good quality. My secret sauce is getting food grade lavender buds. It's a little more expensive but so worth it in my opinion. If I can find the link I used last I will post it here later. Beautiful soap as always!
you should turn the soap with the botanicals facing you so the wires don't drag them inside
More clean ingredient soaps like this please! My skin won’t  tolerate many fragrances or colorants. Maybe make one “cleaner”’ ingredient soap per launch? :)
Gorgeous!
How long do the botanicals last on top before they start turning brown? I know some still have an issue with it.
Katie, Where did you get your slab cutter?  I remember Evangeline and Kermit but I don't remember this one. Thanks. Sherry
I might be a little late to the comment party, but regarding your grey lavender issue, I buy a loose lavender tea from NM Tea Co. That has never faded on me, not sure if it's kosher for beauty products, but I figure if I can eat it it might be safe https://www.nmteaco.com/Lavender-Organic_p_449.html
I love you Katie. You're the best!! 😍, and almost like the love you put on every thing you do..💖 I sarted making soaps the first time I saw you, thank you so much because I 've learned so many things about soaps.😘😘😘 🤗🤗🤗Lots of kisses and hugs for you and your little pretty princess Lily(she is really lovely) Best wishes.God bless you all. 😊🙏💐
Can you make a video of how to choose the right oils for your soap (coconut oil, palm oil etc) and how to know how to put the right measurements for your batch? Beginner here 🙋‍♀️
Lovely. Thanks for sharing.
I bought this soap and got it in a week ago. It smells soooo good!!! Love it, and wish I could have bought more of them!
I feel like it needs a dash of glitter. Silver holo, pearlescent white, or just plain sliver glitter would make it twice as pretty if you ask me. It already is a beautiful soap!
YOU PEASANT
Just got my order of this bar of soap! Thank you, Katie for letting us grab some of your amazing soap! I can't wait to try this out. Much love from Canada!
I ordered this soap and OMG!! I need more. Thank God I purchased 2 bars...but the fragrance. Heaven in a bar...hmmmm
i rlly love the style of soap youve been doing recently, more natural, no frosting. some people may say it’s boring but i really like it.
Hi, forgive me if this has already been asked...how do you keep the flower petals so beautiful and not turn brown/gray from the lye? Mine have always turned a shade of "icky". Thanks!
I am a bit of both.
I ordered this soap and its out for delivery. <3  Ive never been so exited about a bar of soap lol
I hardly comment but I ALWAYS WATCH!!! Congratulations 🎊🎉🤰your awesome 👏🏽 well ur family is awesome ur husband cracks me up😂😂😂and ur baby is beautiful!! Oh wait I didn’t even mention the so is beautiful 🥰🤦🏽‍♀️🤩
I LOVE this soap. I hope you make more of this one or just more natural soaps. I will definitely keep buying!
just got mine in the mail, the scent is so strong!! 💖
If you want a really vibrant and beautiful blue/purple flower petal for your soaps try Blue Lotus! It smells so amazing and looks so gorgeous! 😍
Have you ever put a luffa into a soap?
I’m only here for the watching of the soap cutting
I just spritz my lavender buds with a bit of alcohol and then sprinkle them with purple mica and then toss them around until fully coated lol.
Long Island New York, there’s a lavender farm where you can buy bags of dried lavender that are still bright purple
I love you so freaking much. Not only are your soaps amazing, but you are so adorable and quirky and so much fun to watch.
Thank you so so so much for mentioning marketing ingredient claims and advertising. I looked up the marketing laws in Australia and they are very similar to the USA. You can't market a cosmetic as having therapeutic/healing properties, even if the benefits are well known, unless you are registered to do so. Frustrating! I'll just have to get creative with my cosmetic advertising when I start my bath & body business. :)
Can someone tell me if she covers her soaps up before unmolding them or no?
Could you have put the flowers IN the soap?
"Geeeet OFF of there, you peasant! Peasants EVERYWHERE!" - ahahahahaahahah
Katie, I am looking for a KIT for someone looking to start their own small cold process business... do you have any recommendations?
This is such pretty soap! It reminds me of beach sand, especially with the way you textured it! <3
You should update your Polly Ana soap
Can I do what you do with melt and pour? Or doesn't it have to be cold process.... Also can you do melt and pour frosting? Where can I find out how much fragrance oil to add to my melt and pour?
If you were to add a drizzle over the flowers would they stick better?
Happy new year
Have you done a peach soap before?
You should make a zen garden soap! With a bonsai tree inside or on top. Also the beginning looks like a beach. You should make a beach themed soap!
_get off of there you peasant!_   Crying
But the soap from royalty soaps DOES do more than get you clean!  It gets you clean, makes you happy, makes you smell good, and makes your bathroom look aesthetically pleasing 👌😋
Love this kind of soap bet it smells amazing, looks very cool and homemade with the blooms
Where can I buy your soaps?
Looooveeee this soap
Lemon meringue  pie soap!
Lol your voice is adorable
She has such a good heart. It shines everytime she does anything 💚
You're just so awesome and I totally think we'd be besties if we lived near each other. I love your videos and your soap ♥️
Beautiful soaps! :)
Who wants the soap making kit from Katy! We do! We do!
Hi Katie!!  Is there an email address I can send a message to?  My husband bought me some of your soaps for Christmas, and used his PayPal account.  A few days later his account was hacked, and he wanted you to know about it in case it has happened to you or any of your other customers.  Please let me know, if you can.  Thank you! Jackie
your voice always make my day....and the soap looks good
It is so true that opposites attract. My mom is short and my dad is tall. My mom is of German/Hanover descent and my is of Scottish/Stewart descent. My mom has dark hair and eye, while my dad has light hair and eyes. She looks sweet and innocent (but she's not), my dad looks like someone you would not want to run into in a dark alley (but if you were attacked in a dark alley he would rush to your defense/help you and he is great with and loves babies [if we lived near you he would babysit Lilly for free]).
this is the last video you uploaded in 2018, but the first video me and my parents watched in 2019.
Omg all your soap are amazing and your videos are sooooo satisfying. You're wonderful and I'm now your biggest fan:)
From a far it looks like a casserole😂
So gorgeous!!!
Try here for lavender! https://www.fromnaturewithlove.com/soap/product.asp?product_id=HERBLAVSUPFR360
Is there a reason why you don't put the botanicals inside the soap (outside of the powders), rather than on top?  I'm just curious and know nothing about soap lol.
I'm a realist who writes romance.
Does she have a slight lisp? Just wondering.
I love watching your videos:) ♡ makes me happy
😂 “dang u camera -1:Katie -0”
The soap color reminds me of lush’s ro’s Argans soap and the ro‘s Arian body conditioner. (Both smell fantastic btw) u should try it
Was it just me or did anyone else have a commercial come on when she said after this quick commercial break
Serious question..I use CBD oil everyday for pain relief. Can I use this oil in my soap recipe? I am thinking I should only use it in amounts like an essential oil or a message oil. How would I calculate for that since CBD oil is not on the list of usable oils?
Who else is watching this a year later 🤭
Can you PLZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ make a rainbow soap 🙏🙏🙏🏳️‍🌈
Can you make a black soap
What if you flip the soap on the other side with the top facing you? It won’t pull through the soap it will push it off instead... I’ve been watching you and i think that might work better and you will have fewer drag marks
Is there a website where I can purchase these soaps?
Do you not think with a few rose petals on the inside would spice up the soap a bit? Anyway, it's still an amazing looking soap
You’re a romantic, Hes a realist XD
"After this quick commercial bre-"            Ad starts playing Me: O_O
You are an artist!  Love watching you make soaps!
I think it would work better if you cut the bars with the botanicals facing you
Maybe you could try to roll the lavender buds in some kind of purple/blue myca? I know botanical soap is supposed to look all organic, but if you choose a subtle purple it could be a nice touch and would make them more vibrant?
Soooo beautiful. Nature always has the best colour schemes :)
Not to bother you, but I had some ideas popping out. I'll leave them here. I haven't searched your channel yet. Here goes: Gnomes and fairies and mushrooms, Mexico's Day of the Dead with sugar skulls, mixed nuts, trees with "roots", THE 80'S!! retro pinks and blacks and all ya'll!, bones and skeletons for Halloween, birds in spring, and The Tooth Fairy!! We can buy a bar to give the kids to celebrate losing their first tooth. One slab for masculine and one for feminine, bubble gum, wood/woodgrain/earthy, back to school pencils and paper with an apple for the teacher
I would like to request a soap that's malachite. You asked in your amethyst for other geode ideas. You got a new sub today. Thanks!
Gorgeous soap 😘😘
Happy 2019!! ❤❤ I love your videos
Have you tried Mountain Rose Herbs for your lavender? Mine has been quite blue.
Just  suggestion - if you put the loaf on its other side while cutting (so the top is facing you) you shouldn't get any of those drag marks - as the flowers are the last bit to be cut.    Hope that makes sense? love the soap as always!! :)
PANCAKE SOAP FOR THE NEW YEAR!!!!!!? PLZ
I'm getting this and the rose quartz edition, MARK MY WORDS
So happy to have stumbled across your channel earlier this year. I’m not a soap maker, but I create so I enjoy watching. Not only because of that but you are just a real person. You embrace life, quarks and all. It’s so refreshing to see another mom just say, “Hey, this is me today. Take it or leave it. “  Thanks for just reminding me to just embrace life. Take it, or leave it.
Way better than the original 👌✨ what if you turned the soap so the flowers were facing yourself so they don’t drag thru the whole soap ?????????????
My guess is you're the realist & Caleb is the romantic? I missed Caleb's voice saying  "would YOU rather.........." because whatever comes after that always makes me chuckle.  As far as the health claims, would the botanical properties even hold up after lye/saponification? I dont know, i'm not a soaper! I'm here for your commentary & the pretty creation process :) (which also cause me to purchase said pretty creations & support aforementioned commentator ) ;). Best wishes in 2019 Katie, Caleb, Lily & bean! :)
Katie @royaltysoaps why can't you put the soap top facing the other direction? With the bottom first and the top out. Then no drag marks
My only claim with my homemade soaps, is that they do not contain coconut or palm products.
Hi Katie, you can get beautiful dried lavender from Victoria Lavender Farm here in British Columbia. It is bright purple after it has been dried. Wishing you and yours a wonderful New Year.
Your shirt color makes your eyes POP! Practically glowing. Love the soap!
I think you are a romantic and Caleb is a realist
Awesome! I love making botanical soaps!  Try turning your log so the botanicals are facing the opposite way. I find less drag marks that way. But... I like the drag marks on some because I think it adds character to the bar!  Happy New Year!
GET OFF OF THERE YOU PEASANT! Peasants everywhere...
Do a seahorse soap!!!😀😀😀❤️❤️❤️😀❤️😀❤️😀😀❤️
Katie!! I love this so much!! Flowers + primary colors is a yes from me!
textured tops yessssssssssssssssssss
Can you dust the lavender bits in a mica and then use?
Another botanical that keeps it colour is hibiscus petals   Its one of my favorites 😊
I know culinary lavander tends to be more colorful than the usual dried flower
Longtime fan. But thanks in particular for being pro-science and anti-woo and not making ridiculous claims for herbal ingredients. It gives you great credibility as a businessperson.
I think bramble Barry 🤔 lavender is the best as I tried all kind of brands
If you put in the loaf butt-first you avoid the drag marks... love your work, keep it up!
Happy new year to the entire royal sud family and court! ☺
Happy Happy New Year Katie and family. I have learned so much about soaping from you. When i see my soap outcomes now compared to even 6 months ago? Wow. The Royalty Soaps  piping set has helped me step up my game even more. Many blessings to you and yours for 2019
Your shirt fits so much with your eyes, just noticed how amazing their color is
Can someone comment after me? Like seriously on every video I comment on, no one does after I do??
I've had good luck using hibiscus leaves actually, even using them in the mixture they've maintained a good colour ✌☺ I haven't tried using the orange & yellow varieties yet but certainly the red & pink ones do well. Well wishes from South Africa, love love love your channel. ❤
Hey Katie, have you ever tried using the piping set in the base? Like in an empty mold take your piping and pipe into the mold, if this makes any sense at all as I am past thirty hours with no sleep, then you could make some really cool designs doing this, by piping it in instead of pouring it. Like making a checkered pattern.
When you were sprinkling the calendula, Katie, I started thinking, "I can't wait til the glitter comes." ☺
I looove this bar it’s so beautiful! Unfortunately I’m allergic to chamomile 😅  Something that’s supposed to be soothing makes me itch like someone lit fire to me!
I love the music when you're mixing everything together. So relaxing...
I love your videos and I want to buy some soap from you because they're beautiful but I'm allergic to the coconut and almond oils you use! Nut allergies are common, so could you please, please make a hypoallergenic soap? Much love from Maryland
BEAUTIFUL as always! Question....why don't you turn the soap the other direction to prevent the drag marks?
That Autofocus! At least you weren't doing anything wild with the soap like swirls or something. So we didn't miss much! Love the look of this soap!
AWESOME BLOSSOM            💙👽♥️ Oh, my gosh = OMG  I can smell that wonderful fragrance ALL the way to Roswell, New Mexico.! ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️ 🥂🍾 Happy New Year.!!
Im so excited!!! binging before the new year! and just ordered a Scrapey Scrapey shirt!!!!!
I love this soap. Leaving it the natural color and using the flowers for color is pure genius.
When is your next soap release?
Hope I get to the website in time to be able to buy this!
Ooohh! Pretty🤗 I bet that soap would also be pretty with a ghost swirl!
The music in this one was very calming
I have dried a few different lavenders but always go grey or brown,rose petals keep their colour for a long time I'm sure this smells amazing but for me I'm not really fan of the colour  just my opinion Can't wait for 2019 and Royalty Soaps
'Geeeit off of there you PEASANT!' XD
I am a realist but am not afraid to dream big
When you added in the botanical powders would they have fragrenced the soap naturally??
Katie I think it would be awesome to do a month of Disney movie inspired soaps. Like Disney Princess's Ariel and Flounder (my favorite)
You live in the perfect environment to grow lavender. You could pick it fresh the day you make the soap providing you make the soap after the lavender blooms.
It's sad I wouldn't be able to get this one, I'm allergic to sage, anybody else?
Caleb is the romantic and you're the realist, for sure 😜
Would wrapping the soap in cling wrap help with the flower fallout, or just make things more different? I am thinking of how sushi is made and wrapped up before chopping.
9:08 😂😂😂
Ah, it'd be so helpful if you made a video about soap claims! I've been struggling to create interesting language to describe my soap without making any cosmetic or drug claims. I feel like I can only say "skin-loving" so many times before it becomes repetitive.
I don't know if Jacaranda flowers would be able to be use in your soaps but they are an extremely beautiful and natural vibrant purple. They retain their vibrancy even when dry.
Katie,  I did not find the information in your description, but if you don’t mind saying, where did you purchase your slab cutter? By the way, I love watching your videos and your end results. You have given me the confidence to start making my own videos… Now I just have to learn how to edit! Thanks, Jan at the Pewter Dragonfly.
... i always said it ka-len-doola for calendula my mother was a master Gardener ... O.o
PurpleHazeLavender.com sells bright, freshly dried lavender buds. Your lavender looks gray cuz it’s OLD
If you had the top of the soap facing away from the hinge of the cutter would the botanicals not be dragged in the cut? Because of the angle of the wires? It doesn’t bother me, but I’m just wondering.
Thank you for all the beautiful soap videos this year! Can't wait to see all the video's with your creations in 2019! Happy New Year! Just a thought: don't you have less drag marks if you turn the soap around and have the top facing you instead of the camera? Then you slice the piece with the flowers on top last instead of first.  It's less appealing for the camera, because we see the bottom part instead of the top part. But it may help with avoiding the marks.  As I said; just a thought.... don't know if it's helpful.
Can someone please explain to me what happen to avangeline the purple cutter is she broken
I'm both with a healthy sprinkle of romantic fairy sparkly love...  My husband is absolutely 150% REALIST, he might actually be an Android.
My dream soap from you is lavender , tonka, and ylang ylang
💖💖💖💖
🧤🧤🧤🧤🧤🧤🧤🧤🧤🧤PLEASE make a lavender rose soap for 2019, and make it pastel lavender, champagne, and gold colored. Specifically gold glitter on white truffles piped on light champagne and lavender marble effect styled soap!!!!! 🧤🧤🧤🧤🧤🧤🧤🧤🧤🧤 Edit: lavender petals would still blend with this just as well as roses.
Soooo, I tried watching other YouTube soap making videos and it’s just not the same as you! Even soap makers you suggest! I’m so used to watching you. I can’t watch a video where they don’t talk and interact with the viewers. With this being said, my oldest daughter who is 6 we LOVE watching your videos. We watch them every night before bed. I had even gotten her a soap making kit for Christmas! Keep being you, and congratulations on the newest bundle of joy! ♥️
I'm obsessed with my oil diffuser. Can you use your fragrance oils in an oil diffuser? I would love to mix up my own oils!
Gorgeous soap!  Love botanicals!
Love all the natural look of this soap Katy....Happy New Year to you and your family....Thankyou for all your hard work and sharing your creations....xx
So beautiful!!! 🤩
I love your videos! Could you add a layer of clear melt and pour on the top to seal in the petals? Ooh, or what about a clear layer 8n the middle, with the petals encapsulated?
So itll get me clean and smell good....sounds like soap to me lol
Beautiful 💖  Could you make a stained glass soap?
Peasants everywhere!! Lol
Love the fact that you steer clear of making false, or at least unsubstantiated claims about botanicals or extracts. Medical psudeoscience is an extremely popular thing to pass around on the internet, and sometimes it can be dangerous to someone's health.   Botanicals may have some healthy effects, as herbs and extracts are often the basis of much more concentrated treatments made in labs, but to endorse them as magical cure-alls is just irresponsible.
I love the natural color! And all of the botanicals on top are so pretty!
What happens when you put botanicals in the soap itself not just on top?
Cheers! 🥂 Can’t wait to see what you do in 2019!
Beautiful! I thought the title said "Botanical Soup"!😁
Beautiful as usual.......the blue flowers are actually overflowed petals ( I am a florist of over 30 years) I've seen them called so many different names...lol.....a purple flower I've seen used on soap that is called statice is also called everything from orchids to bluebells, it's a super cheap flower and I think it's called other names partly because the wholesalers aren't really sure what it is and to make it sound more expensive ! Can't wait to see what soaps you come up with in the New year :-)
I'd love to see a beauty and the beast soap!! With a clear glycerin imbed/layer with rose flowers and something beautiful and gold on top!!   Rose scented of course
Before she added the flowers, it just kinda looked like a slab of a gravy. I bet it smells really nice but it looked like gravy.
I know it’s not very camera pretty but just... cut them the other way around with the tops facing you ..... that way the things on the top won’t scratch the soap .....
You know the old animated Alice in Wonderland movie? This reminds me of the flower scene from that!
Still waiting on that pizza 🍕 soap
8:44 awh. Disapointment, no noise, only peasants but....no pring...... a different noise at 9:30 after such force 9:25
Try Anthony's French lavender or I think they have blue lavender also if I'm not mistaken. But I use the Anthony's French lavender and I actually use all Anthony's there not expensive and they r great quality also if u get food grade rise Bud's or lavender the color is beautiful in almost any Brand
Is it just me because I get really buggy about the thumbs down people. How can you possibly give our Royalty Court a thumbs down? I will find you people ...and I will destroy you bwhahahaha!
Happy New Year!  Gods Blessings in 2019.  Thank you for sharing your gifts with all of us😘. Congratulations on your new bundle arriving this next year.
Beautiful soap Katie
Katie! If you want bright blue flowers, try butterfly pea flowers! They're used in tea most popularly because they change colour, and they're inexpensive!!!
I loaf these soaps
I notice sometimes the lye water solution is clear but in this video it’s milky. Why is that?? Love your soaps!
I think French lavender goes grey quicker
Beautiful soap Katie 💛💜🧚🏻‍♀️🦋🦄🐞🐢🐠🌻🍄🍀🎍🥀🌞🌸🌝🌈⭐️
Okay, I think I'm going to have to stay up late so I can order this soap. Two am alarm, here I come.   Wait, dang it - that's a Wednesday morning.....aww Katie, can't you do it on a Friday? LOLOL
But what was the song when she was blending D: I NEED TO KNOW
Wish we MP soap makers could use botanicals but sadly all they do is turn brown and lavender? - OMG - mouse poo!
Love your videos have watched quite a few from the begging to now. Very inspiring. I've done a lot of melt and pour and other stuff for years. Just haven't ventured into cold process yet but really want to.
Can’t wait for the soaps to be on sale again😆💜
Happy new year 💖🥳
Such a pretty soap!! When using lavender buds on my soaps I put them in a small container and shake them up with some purple mica to improve their color. Love you videos ... and congrats to the new little one of our expecting!!
When do we get the studio tour?
I love your channel! Keep it up gurl!
Love this!🦋
Girl you look radiant! I love simple elegant soaps! This soap is just sublime and I love the chill music in the video soap meditation!😀
Have you ever thought of painting the sides of the soap after it has set up?
I'm both. I love the simplicity of this soap!
Those blue bottle buds 😍😍😍😍💐
The base with only the botanical powders in it is such a nice color that you could use for an iced coffee soap maybe

hi hi, If you place the bar sideways with the botanicals facing you instead of the hinge on kermit, you should have less streaks
The city your P.O. Box is in, is my boyfriends last name! :o
Happy New Year! Would you ever consider making this one without added scent?
I'm a realist but I can dream XD I'm a sucker for dumb romance shows, no matter how unrealistic
It reminds me of Little House on The Prairie. It makes me happy..
Another awesome video Katie! 💜💜💜
Yeahh! My favourite soap!
Happy New Year's
i was super hype for this soap but i am allergic to dandelion TT____TT
These are my favorite kinds of soaps 😁
Hey Katie kind of a strange question have you ever dropped the camera inside the soap while filming the close up I feel paranoid every time you film it 😂❤️❤️❤️love you your amazinggggg
Did you mix EOs for this one or a blend of FOs? Thanks for the video and Happy New Year!!
I read the description for the first time and now I'm MASSIVELY curious which videos are sponsored and which aren't from the disclaimer. This is a gorgeous soap and I bet it smells beautiful!
Lavender is so easy to grow and it gets bigger every year. The buds hold the color, mine never fade. Pretty soap!
That color top makes your eyes pop and kinda makes them look a little more green compared to the usual blue that they look
All I can think about is that it looks like fudge before you textured it xP
Frontier Natural Products whole lavender from iherb looks beautiful and purple 👌🏻👌🏻
Really enjoyed this soap. I love natural and botanical designs and this one is gorgeous ❤️
Your videos are so soothing. I watch you literally for hours.
French Blue lavender really keeps their color!
I used to be a romantic but recently I've become more of a realist. Maybe next year I can get to a healthy middle way.
The flowers look like New Year's confetti.
THIS IS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL  SOAP PLAINNA5URAL AND CLEAN LOVE IT
Im ordering a kit from bramble berry! Im so excited! Im now going to make my own soap, and so happy
I  hope you have great New years festivities !!
In my faith (paganism) calendula and lavender are actually sacred to the fairies 😊 when you mentioned fairies I wondered if you knew the significance lol. Lovely bars!
This has to be my favorite that you've ever made. I love it so much!!!
Katie, you use two different stick blenders. I am assuming there isn't a difference in them, but wanted to ask in case it matters to the recipe.
,
There's a business in Pike Place in Seattle that sells dry lavender, and it's really beautifully blurple.
I personally know that color preserved lavender exists, I think i found one on Amazon that you might wanna try. It's name is D'vine Dev Lavande Sur Terre 8 Cups Culinary Grade Highland Grow Dried Lavender Buds with Easy Resealable Huge Glass Bottle. It's classified as blue grade lavender. :) hope it helps
Beautiful! I think on the next round of making it, you should do a mix of the previous two and do a subtle swirl with the natural soap color and a lightened color ❤
Are we bubbles in the Royal Court of Bubbliciousness...? a lovely soap to leave 2018 with...thanks for all the vids and here's to 2019 🎆
Get off of there you peasant!
I don't know the password to access your website I was trying to find pricing and shipping cost?
uwu im early kinda
Oheckyes
I really like this one. Can you put the flowers in the soap? Have you ever put them in the soap?
If you flip the bar the opposite way, with the top towards you instead of us, then the strings cant drag any of the toppers down through the soap.
I have no intrest in making soap but i love watching your videos. You are such a lovely person. Happy New Year
Is it wrong that watching this made me hungry .... Before the flowers that looked like a big pot to caramel pudding!! 😛
Happy New Year to you and your family.
"Giiiit off of there, you peasant!"  - I lost it. XD
My favorite of all the soaps you make.  The others are pretty to watch.  But this soap would be the one I use.  Happy New Year!
*PEASANTS EVERYWHERE*   🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I love the question of the day. 🥳 happy new year!
Katie, will you still be doing a PO Box unboxing video? I was really looking forward to that one
Was excited for soap. Saw first additive and I’m allergic to it 🤦🏼‍♀️ lol
I would love to see you using more EO/natural colorants kind of soap in 2019 :) Thanks for all your videos Katie!! xoxo
Your eyes and your shirt work together perfectly
I've loved watching your videos this year, may 2019 be prosperous and happy for you and your family. Keep on Scrapey scraping!
Where did you get your necklace in the intro? I love it!
I LOVE IT!!!  Near and dear to my heart with the flower petals and I know what you mean about the Calendula getting caught up on the cutter.  I don’t see the big slab mold or cutter on your equipment list, would you share where you purchased them?
This soap is gorgeous as always! I think a pretty soap idea would be perhaps layers of your regular soap formula, and then a middle layer of clear melt and pour with full flowers inside! Kind of like those lipsticks with the flowers suspended in them. Just a thought!
*Happy New Year! May 2019 be the BEST YEAR FOR EVERYONE!*  🤗
Thank you so much Dutchess.. You have been one of my biggest inspirations as a soup maker. And since I actually am a beginner soap maker. LOL these jewels of information I find very valuable. You have always been an inspiration and continue to teach me so much. I appreciate all the things you so much And congratulations on baby number 2!!!
So awesome!!!! A Natural beauty !!!
Beautiful! Try looking on Mountain Rose Herbs for nice organic fair trade herbs of all kinds.
Did anybody catch her reflection in the oils?
I do have a jar of dried lavender tea, and while it does lack vibrancy I love how it turns the tea into a blue/violet like color. I do wonder if it would make your bath water change colors :3
Looking at you, essential oil MLMs who claim to cure just about anything ! You ruined it for everyone.
I wish you would double or triple your inventory again you sell out so quickly😕
Dried lavender looks like mouse turds
Love this one 💜
Just fabulous 😍
I always thought soap making was such a cool thing to do and now i know how to do it from your videos! Happy New Year!
Happy happy New Year to You and ur family ❤️ from Sabrina ❤️❤️💋
Hi I have just started a YouTube channel thanks to you, katie you inspired me to do something for myself and I really love doing it. It’s mainly about art because I love it so much😍 It would mean the world to me if y’all can just check it out and tell me what you think of it 😊😊
I love ur videos ❤️❤️❤️
Woo!! I made it to one of your videos early today!!
Beautiful soap 😍
Watching your videos always puts a smile on my face. I'm so happy I discovered your channel this year. <3
Love love love this!!!
Do you use your soaps yourself? I love your videos and I keep meaning to make my own soap. I have the space and I saw a huge 100oz mold on Amazon.
Wrong spoon! Where's tje one you saod was the old hero spoon? Lol
Cornflower? Anne Marie uses it.
Lavender for me always turns grey and brown.
Some Scrooge gave a 👎. Booo
I have found that growing lavender yourself, and cutting them while they are blooming [not after] and then hanging them upside down in a dark room or closet, they keep their colour and their smell! Beautiful soap <3 Happy new year !
Your soaps are SO diverse! I’m convinced at this point you can do anything
I’m a realromantic 🤔😬💕
"Get off of there you peasant! Peasants everywhere!" Lol  I love this soap. I did notice you didn't add safflower this time....  Much love Katie! Xoxo
You are a romantic and he is most definitely a REALIST!
Do you ever film a studio tour and I just missed it??
That really is beautiful.
Lovely Katie!  Did you use FO or EO?
I love the look of this soap. I love all your soaps but I have a skin allergy to most if not all soap dyes. I would love to grab one of these bars
Would turning the loaf the other way (top towards you) when slicing with Kermit help with drag marks?
This soap is so beautiful! Reminds me of spring. I really don’t like the smell of lavender, but I think this would smell lovely. Those blue bottle flowers are gorgeous!
I love the botanical soaps!!
Link to where you got your fragrances.  They are fo's, correct? Btw - OMGosh,  gorgeous soap!
Hi there! Greets from Romania
Happy New Year Royal Family!
Im actually currently growing and drying my own lavender for that very reason. While i don't mind the dullness of my purchased ones i find my homegrown ones just dried so beautifully. I plan on making my garden function for my botanicals for my soaps and oil infusions. That way i know where they came from and how they were taken care of.
Are we going to get a tour.
I love this so much! Your soaps are always so pretty!!!
I bet this soap would look really cool if you made it go through gel phase!
PEASANT!! 🤣
I love this soap 😍😍😍
Your piping set is sold out and I'm so sad I cant get my hands on it 😭
when can i buy this?
Gorgeous love!
Best tips on mixing micas??? I keep having issues getting my blended right without making the batter set up fast lol. Need some ideas!
I get asked all the time if my soap will help acne, eczema, psoriasis, etc and it kills me that I can't answer!
I live, ear, and breath for these soap videos and I don't even know why 😂
So strange - this last week I made my first ‘natural’ soap made with coconut cream and blueberries for scent / colour. No botanicals on top - but maybe next time!  ❤️❤️❤️
That soap is fantastic! I do love all the natural additives ❤️
Beautiful ❤️💐
Thank you!!! I have to explain this to well meaning customers constantly! Yes I put it in there, no I can't hashtag it's botanical benefits. You could though! Feel free. 😂😂😂
You look extra pretty in this intro! Got that mama glow goin'!
The color just from the powders looks like a cappuccino or late and it looks so good.
I have really learned how to "word" what I say it does lol. I hate how many hoops they have with what we can and can't do. I totally get it but still lol.
AHHHH FINAL VIDEO OF THIS YEAR!!! Marks that I’ve been watching you for a whole year now and this is my first ever comment!! Just thought I’d say thank you so much for always being there when I was sad, bored and annoyed, you and your videos make me so happy. I hope you have a great year thank you again ❤️
😍😍😍😍
Love your imagination. Lili is really cute
