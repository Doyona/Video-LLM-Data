Do you have layers in your hair?
My hair is naturally very curly and soft, it goes down just above my belly button when it's straight, but only just above my bust when curly. So it looks nothing like this.. its more on the 80s wild look. and it's so hard to manage. My mum keeps telling me to cut it. I don't know if I should cut it or if I should grow it out so it looks like this.
What is the name of your haircut??😍😍
These isnt curls this is wavy hair
Watching your hair videos makes me sad because your hair is absolutely goals but at the same time, I can't resist watching them because you have such gorgeous hair.
How could you be SO PERFECT?
you are really so cute
My hair is only maybe 2  inches shorter and looks NOTHING like hers. Why?? 😭

The ponytail method is literally the fastest way to curl your hair, I love it ❤️ I actually just did a video using the same trick except for mine I concentrated more on how to deal with thin hair that doesn't hold a curl for very long 😕
Oh ma god... U r so beautiful
what sort of hair cut do you get? Just simple layers? What do you tell your stylist? I would really appreciate an answer, your hair is  complete GOALS
Thankyou this is so helpfull...❤
Most videos I have seen.  All of these people have perfectly straight and non frizzy hair before curling their hair.  i have curly and frizzy hair.
What primer and hairspray do you use?? ❤️❤️

if i were to go to a saloon to dye my hair your hair colour, how should i describe it?
Guys this vid is great, but check out Kayley Melissa’s version if these curls don’t stay on you (like for me), she uses a diy bobby pin scrunchie so you don’t have to pull your curls through the elastic when taking out the ponytail
You often sa basically 🤗
do you have layers dear?
You are so beautiful !!! Also loved this tutorial
I love your long hair so pretty
I have never... seen... a hair... that gorgeous.

Türk Varmı la
Btw this is not helpful for ppl who already have wavy or curly hair, because it will look frizzy and not attractive. Instead you will find yourself straightening your hair before actually just doing curls to your pony tail. So, forget about the ten minutes.
OMG she's Beautiful
sheesh, ur so gorgeous from head to toe.
My friend has hair like you 👌🏽🔥
You have long thick effing gorgeous hair 😭😭😭😭

She sounds like Selena Gomez.. :/
straight hair, curly, wavy, messy style, everything.. fits you so beautifully. :)
it literally takes me 3 hours to curl my hair i have so much and puting it in a ponytail makes it sooo much faster
When people try complimenting my hair, I'll give them a strange look and stamp the link to this video on their forehead. My hair is ugly af compared to this holy masterpiece I just witnessed 😭🙏🏼
If I had that much hair I would not have the patience to sit through and curl all of it, haha. I have long, wavy hair, and I've tried to curl it before to give my waves more definition. Got through about three sections and gave up. Whoops.
oh my god i love your hair 😍
Yours so beautiful😍😍
Hairgoals 😍❤
I like but I can't
i saw something like this but with teo pony tails, or pig tails c:
OMG ur so pretty! Is ur skin naturally clear? If not your still so pretty and natural!
Omg I'm so jelly ur hair is absolutely beautiful
Warning: this is only works if u have straight hair
I've tried the ponytail curling method it doesn't work guys
This is how I curl my hair😊 it makes it wayyy easier....I recommend this method ❤

Your hair is perfect!!
Your hair looks amazing as always! Could you do a video about how you take care of your hair ? Because my hair is quite long but not as healthy as yours..
Perfect ♥
You should have filmed you getting the hair cut again,  but the whole process to see them cutting it off exactly
Best hair in the business!
If you aren't as fortunate to have her long beautiful locks like me with shoulder to boob length hair, you can still do this and have it turn out looking good just instead of one pony, do two:) a super high one and then one on the back of your head:)
Why are you so perfect:(

i liked the voice over for this video! some of your voice overs in previous videos have been a bit soft & hard to hear but this one was perfect! thoroughly enjoyed this video. heart eyes for dayyyyyys😍
looks great! seems useful trick to since i have very thick hair anything to save time trying to style it all helps XD
If you're being sponsored, you should write it in your description bar. Just saying!
Best hair I've ever seen
My hair is the same length as yours but you have volume,texture,thickness and sadly I have none of that in my hair...
You definitely inspired/persuaded me to not dye my hair anymore and instead let my natural colour grow out. I have basically the same hair colour as you naturally but I always dyed it and now my hair is beyond dead ):
Where is her shirt from?!?!
Gorgeous! I love this!
pretty :))

You are so awesome. You're not look a lot of other Makeup YouTubers. You are the day to day normal girl. I feel like I connect your videos more, maybe because you're close to my age. Anyways, I went on a rant, but I love your channel and I wish to meet you one day! Happy Valentines Day!
I ALWAYS LOVE YOUR HAIR THEY ARE PERFECTION! 😍❤  I have a chanel too! If you guys want you can check it out! :) Thank you if you will! ❤
