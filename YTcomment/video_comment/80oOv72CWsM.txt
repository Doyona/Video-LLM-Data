Waaaaay to fast!! Lol

What are the sizes of the bedframe??
I replaced our double bed with a trampoline today... I absolutely loved it...but the wife went through the roof...
How big ist the head bord can someone please tell me it’s very important!❤️
So do you need a box spring or just a matress or both?
What are those holes for all the brackets middle beam and the rails?   To make it a little taller right?
Y los cajones?
What size is the frame? Full,King or Queen ?
What size is the frame??? I need one like that
Anyone have a solution to a creaky bed like when I move on it it makes noises ?? I have a memory foam mattress could that be the problems ?
Thinking to buy in queen size. Will it come in a sedan?
those metal rails look fragile. I think I will replace them with some proper wood. and the middle rail will get one or two wooden legs.
do you happen to know if it's possible to build this without electrical screwdriver?
Thanks for the video, dad!
my package did not come with the slats, are they supposed to come with them or do i have to buy them separately?
Hi, it seems you are using FIXA or Bosh Electrical Screwdriver, so  I am wondering which is the best to assemble Ikea bed frames generally: FIXA Screwdriver 3.6V or 14.4V?
excellent!!
can i put a box spring in place of the slats?
what size bed was that ?
Guys with step step four you put in the small pot holes fiest and then you push the pieces together. Make sure the pot screws are inside the wooden frame. Good luck
Thank you
I work as a tasker for TaskRabbit, so this is super helpful! Thank you
I love you!
Can I use a mattress + boxspring combo if I lower the mid beam? And am I limited to using only Ikea mattresses and boxsprings?
can you use your own mattress you already have instead of buying an ikea mattress?
Thanks a lot. I did everything but I couldn't know how to pin the four things at the end :)

Hi! Thank you for posting this video. Do you know if this bed is sturdy enough? Thank you!
OMG! Those circle things were so confusing! You're a genuis! Thanks!
Thank you for the video, do you know how to adjust the sides in order to fit in a thicker matter?
awesome work!
You are a lifesaver! My roommate and I were stuck on the 8 circle things and now the bed is not shaking! Thank you!
I am trying to reassemble the bed from my recent move. I am  cannot get both side frames to connect completely to the headboard and the footboard.  I know it has something to do with the metal round hinge.  It needs more visual on that part.  The instruction that came with it can't tell from the picture doesn't tell me anything.
Good englisch brraarr💪🏼👌🏼😩😩😁😁
hey, just wanted to say you saved us from desperation ;) couldn't get the frame to hold and you were the only guy I could find that actually showed how to fixate those big screws! thanks!
The lock parts won't lock, they just go round and round
You saved me nerves right now
