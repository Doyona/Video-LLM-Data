Thank you fof other ways to cook bacon
Bro I follow everything and can’t get it like this. I’m just bad at cooking ITS JS EGG…… 😩
Good video, thank you sir, God Bless
Here in 2025
I cook my omelettes in the rendered bacon grease.
Adding oil to cook bacon😮
I keep coming back to this video lmao.
Guide: Put it in pan. Take it of pan
You did a great job with this! Thank you for this video.
Thanks.
Thanks for the wonderful video. I really wanna enter the world of cooking and this helps a lot! :)
Mine looks better lol
Do not add oil before cooking bacon.  Bacon renders its own fat as it cooks.
Looks very good.  During my last hospital stay, I ordered a ham and cheese omelette every morning for breakfast.  Since bacon wasn't an option I opted for ham, for hospital food it was pretty good.  Now I'm addicted to them and love making a protein/cheese omelette when I can.
Did it taste like metal filings 😂
put it in the grill after, it puffs it up and is overall better
best tutorial yet
was loving life, saw the milk, mood ruined, ain’t hungry no more, you’ve cured starvation with that mockery of a bev
Bacon fries in its own fat.
This was done 4 years ago do people still cook eggs like this sort of fashion
finally someone who makes an omelet the right way
Fantastic sir
How many times you gonna say bacon cheese omelet
Small correction. The tool at the start isn't a sharpener, it's a honer.
I always worry about the shape of how my bacon is cut when it’s mixed in an omelette (where I can’t even fuckin see it)
Here because my roommate moved out and left a dozen eggs in our fridge lmao
Ever had an omelette look like this amateur at a diner. Omelettes should never be brown and rolled inside. Trust me, it takes a lot of eggs to finally make a decent fluffy omelette. these are just burnt eggs.
You made the eggs brown, I don’t like burned eggs.
That food looks so gooood…
Who else loves dairy?🥛🧀
Nice one m8
dislike
beat your eggs for MORE than 5 minutes?
I'm waiting for yr pan flipping technique, that's magic, too fast I can't see!
Egg👍
I'm on the keto diet so all I can eat is eggs, cheese and bacon... Lost 50 pounds this year :P
Holy #$&@ it's so good thank you
Lol I put seasoning on mine and it was bussing
Put a kitchen towel under that cutting board so it doesn’t move and you slip with that knife. Good recipe!
Add Mushrooms in it. This will be 20% Delicious.
Mmmmmm uncoooked bacon I love it.  Somebody teach this moron how to cook.
ay
Don't sharpen your knife over the place where you're going to have food unless you want metal shards in your food...
I see you said "don't forget to clean up after yourself" so you bulred out your mess in the background.
You just made my day bro
Ima keep using this
Didn’t burn it thx
First time cooking eggs and bacon
Easy and simple explanation. Thank you!

أعجبني كثيراً شكراً لك
He used a plate to flip as he replied in a comment. I tried the plate flip method this morning, worked great. Thanks for vid. I plan on plate flippin when I wake up
🙄Y NOT FILIP ON CAMERA, actually that’s what I came here for
This dude has never been laid
Your a fuckin nerd
It’s 2:00 am and I’m hungry
Never seen someone use oil to cook bacon
Haha im not going to flip on camera.... 6 flips and wasted omelettes later.... here it is flipped.
All we have in the fridge right now is eggs, cheese, and bacon crumbles. Hope I don’t completely mess it up
Great video! I've never attempted to make one because I thought it was difficult but you made it so easy! :)
Lmaoo he’s drinking milk with an omelette
Overcooked. Reduce heat so it doesn't brown your eggs. 3/5 stars
I would highly recommend using extra sharp cheddar cheese because its more flavorful but any cheese works :)
Looks good
joseph,  thanks for the comedy channel.You really need to sharpen the knife to cut bacon!   you need to eat an omlette every hour and put on some weight mate. im going to the shop.
I literally did everything you said to do but totally wrong.  I used 3 eggs, ham, beat my meat and eggs for 1 minute and then used my gas stove top not steam like you said...wait..can you turn on steam on your oven to get flame?  Probly not...but mine turned out way better than your steamy bacon catastrophe anyway!
Who’s watching because you don’t got nothing better to do in this quarantine
Ight ima fuck wit ya
I just made this, and didn't chop my🥓🥓🥓🥓I also didn't use any oil, the🥓grease was enough for it not to stick!🙋🏿‍♀️🍳🥚🧀🥓I didn't fold it either, perfect circle. 👍🏿
Usually every single knife I buy is blunt
You don’t need oil for bacon, there’s enough fat in them already
I love to see young people cooking!
Thank you for showing me how make a egg olmett  Terri Jackson
Why didn’t you flip it on camera you pussy
Scardy youtuber blurrs everthing out cuz he aint wanting to get that demonitization
Looks nice and fluffy. Want to make one for my hubby :) going to try now. Thank you
Who is watching this because quarantine got you cookin and stuff 🤣
Don't you like how these fucking geniuses make the cooking of an omelet as such a difficult process that most home cooks have no clue as to how to make. If that bacon is not fully cooked all the way through, then you become sick due to the maggots and parasites from the pork that will now be living in your body. His egg did not look very good because he had the Heat on too high. The egg has to take time, and it must be worked gently, releasing as much moisture on too as you can until, then add your salt and pepper, then your cheese, then any other ingredients, and then just a touch more cheese. For a nice Browning on the outside, add some butter to the pan. Any schmuck can make an omelet. Apparently there are a lot of idiots who actually think they are to become rich and famous and the next food Network star because they videotaped themselves preparing an omelet on YouTube. Instead of taking something easy and trying to trick everyone into thinking it is difficult to do, why not take something difficult to make, and simplifying how easy it could be to make?
Your knife is blunt af! and you made it worse the way you steeled it 😆😆😆
Who else just at home hungry and bored
Why do you need oil when you have the grease from the bacon to cook the omelet in?
Who is watching this because they are hungry and got nothing else but eggs in the fridge?
"Add your salt, add your pepper, and now keep whisking. *AND TURN THE STEAM ON*
this guy has a simple charm..... well done
Dude where is the cheese ?
Is this hard?
I'm watching this while I'm bed lol ugh it looks good
You forgot the best part...Lol the onions and chopped  peppers and tomatoes 😋 yum ..
Thx it worked
Over cooked Man!
looks pretty good. will try it later
I know this was posted in may and it’s currently November, but I learned how to flip an omelette (or egg in general) with a slice of bread. As long as you properly put oil or butter in the pan, once it’s solid enough you can flip with ease. Tilt the pan slightly forward and when the egg or omelette reaches the end, flick with the wrist!! For real tho, it’s pretty easy. Just have to figure out the strength behind it and motion.
Watching this because i have nothing else in my fridge :/ xD
💯🙏💆
Where the eating tutorial?
What you did in the beginning wasn't sharpening it but helps every time you cut something the blade gets tiny bends and that straightens it
Knife skills suck...
I do the same thing just add spinach
Decent tutorial!
Omg that you! I just got done cooking a perfect bacon cheese omelet!
Thank you for the perfect video.. practical and to the point! I'm following it now while making my bacon and cheese omelet. 😁 P.s. I use scissors to cut bacon.
That’s not a knife sharpener
beating your egg for more than 5minutes??? are you crazy
Who is watching this because they are hungry and really like eggs    Edit thanks for all the likes I didn’t know I had so many and my never be able to beat that personal record and ima post it on Facebook because I just feel like it’s something I should do.
Hey thanks for the tips
I am starving. I am fighting a cast iron. It’s not working out for me. I only have sliced cheese. I’ll get it the third try though.
U don’t need to put in oil btw the bacon already has oil
I make the best cheese omelets tbh I don’t know if his tastes better then how I cook mine, I would make a video on how to make a cheese omelet but I’m not into making food videos
Thank you but you skipped the hardest part  lol
The only problem we have is flipping our Omelet thanks for sharing.
I wish I seen how you flipped the omelette. But still cool.
