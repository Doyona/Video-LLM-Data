Thanks! Just the video I needed! 👍
Needed this to un-paint my cosplay katana, thx
Use a Glass pallet and spray wet it, sit a min and scrape off...much easier.
I had to clean a plastic power bank which had acrylic paint and I used a 62% alcohol sanitiser and with a bit of work it came off! Thanks for the tips! ❤
I find that if I fill the bowl with water and let it sit for awhile, most of the paint lifts right off and I can scrub the rest with a scrubby and dish soap.
So I have a small pallet like the one ur using, and I have no problem getting the paint off, I can even peel the dried paint off, but I have another larger plastic pallet that for the life of me I can’t get the paint off, even with rubbing alcohol, it’s still such a pain, the paint won’t peel off and it stains the pallet, anyone else have this issues
Does this still work on paint that was already dried for a long time? (1 year, 4 months, etc.)
Thank you for this video. My dumbass thought it was a good idea to airbrush near my 3D printer, the fans where the hot end sits are covered in yellow paint, luckily acrylic, and I have isopropyl alcohol so I should be good, gonna take some time tho.
I use hot soapy water and let whatever I need washed soak for an hour. Then I scrub with a steel wire brush. It’s messy cuz a lot of paint flakes tend to fly off, but it works.
thank you! messed up on a repaint and couldnt get the paint off it. thank you for saving my project
Thank you I was doing it on one of my repaint dinosaurs 🦕
I have a painted skull. Ill try this and hope it works
This was a life saver I paint ho trains and my little cousin just planted on my favorite train so I just dunked it in alcohol and it just melted away this was great thank you
So before I used rubbing alcohol, I held my plastic tray upside down under hot water.  The paint became gooey I was able to scrape most out & then used just a little rubbing alcohol to clean off the last bits of paint.  Took about 5 minutes per tray.  😉
rlly random but does anyone know if this is a good way to take acrylic paint off of a penny board?
Thx  this really helped

Dear mam     Pls let me knw which alchohol to take brandy rum.    Reply soon     Thanks           Rims1
Simple and 100% working solution is to use vinegar which is used for cooking. 1. add vinegar in palette sockets and keep like that for 5-6 hours. 2. After 6 hours, take old brush and dried acrylic paint can be easily removed.
No FUCKING way, I tried everything and o just needed alcohol.
how many percent alcohol is that
Thank you for sharing
i used an old toothbrush with alcohol it worked great!
Just use Jif or Cif as it's now called.
hub nub
I like your method of using alcohol to clean off the paint 🎨 how long does it typically take you to do this?
OMG! Thank you this helped me so much!!!!!!!!
cool vidie
Rather than using paper towels that takes forever. Best to use a small scrub brush like a suede shoe brush or something like that.
Didn't know about the tips listed below for this kind of paint palette. I was able thankfully, to use your advice on the Isopropyl and it cleaned up very nicely. The paint hadn't completely dried so it was a breeze once I wiped out the wet only a little had dried.
palette like that is not right for acrylic paint.. use a flat palette and cover it with clear tape.. this way.. you just strip off the tape when you done painting
What type of alcohol. Is required
Can you do this with paint brushes that have dried acrylic on them?
can we use alcohol
ahhhh it worked thank u
Also you can put hot water on a bowl and let the dry paint get out.
Yes squirt it 😂 sorry sorry had to! Thanks though! Saved me a ton of frustration! 👍🏼😁
thanks a lot
