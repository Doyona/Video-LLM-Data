DIY to prevent your scarf from slipping + HOW to style them for SHORT HAIR💕 https://youtu.be/e-Zc5lvGRH8
You are so beauotful
I like the second one!  God bless you.
Thank you! I’ve developed a Sun/ UV allergy and can’t be outside without covering my entire body…this will at least help me look a little pretty…I’m tired of looking like a beekeeper all the time lol
Thank you!
what lipstick is this, gorgeous!?
VERY BEAUTIFUL ✨🫶🏼
Great voice, instructions verbally and visually.  Thank you.  More please
Do your scarfs ever slip off?
I'm stuck at 2:11 😭 Every time I try to tie it, it pulls it back from the front/top of my head   How do you do those folds to make it able to be tied?
Mmmm fantastic headscarf video, my lovely style are the last part pirate scarf and i love your red silkscarf ❤❤❤❤❤
Sometimes I think the shape of your head matters because no matter what I do, the scarf slips off toward the back.
Oh God your so beautiful ❤
Where is best to get the scarves from? And what size do I look for please. I have Alopecia and hate wearing a cap or hat 😢
Any recommendations for where to get cute scarves?
Beautiful makeup❤
Where do you get your scarfs from and what kind
I have thinning hair on my scalp.  It's a form of female alopecia.  It's genetic, there's really nothing I can do about it.  I want to hide my scalp when I go out in public so I don't feel so embarrassed.  This video was very helpful!
What is this red lipstick shade. It's gorgeous!!!
جميل جدا❤
I swear the scarves just slide off my head. How do you keep them in place?
Step one: you need a lot of hair to Cover them properly 😂
Really pretty 😊 what kind of material are those scarfs you use? Thanks 😊
Okay this vid totally helped this white girl who is dumbfounded on why we don't get to learn how to do this when we're little like the rest of y'all! White people always be missing out on cool shit 😒 we have no taste 😂 lol anyway I'm here because my hair is so effing long now that I sit on it, it gets stuck in my underwear and my pockets, my dog steps on it when maneuvering behind me on the couch, etc. I've had it! And sleeping with it is brutal, esp bc I'm a recovering opioid addict and I'm medicated with suboxone. And if I sometimes get the beginnings of withdrawal I get all clammy and sweaty as I sleep and I'm laying all over my hair, and it's just a big hot mess. I tried a silk cap but my hair just kept sloshing all around inside and it didn't stay well. But this? Girl you saved me! I bought a 60" rectangly one at Walgreens with no effing clue how to use it. I mean, I'd have a greater chance of helping NASA launch their next satellite. And mine wasn't long enough to do your pretty beehive-esque one with that mauve scarf, so I had to improvise. But I did it! It feels good and secure, and I'm lying in bed with a breeze blowing through my window AND I CAN FEEL IT ON THE NAPE OF MY NECK! I'm in love. I want to start wrapping my hair as like. This is my hairstyle today! Now I want to get all the pretty scarves and learn how to do different styles! It's so so cool. And I don't feel like a little old Polish lady because it's being wrapped around my head more turbanlike, and not the dainty triangle scarf tied once under the neck 😂. Half my family is Polish so I've seen it a lot. Those old ladies always look so cute though, it works for them! 😊☺️

What type of fabric are you using? It looks stretchy. Is it polyester and spandex combined? What is the width of your rectangle fabric?
This what I been looking for Thank You So Much
How long are your scarves?
Thank u for this so much. Very pretty girl and absoulutley love the matte deep red lipstick. I can do wraps but the high bun wraps was a bit tricky as I forgotten how to do it LOL. This is a great reminder and some other styles are quite intresting.  Thanks once again for this video.
Love this u are adorable 🥰
What size scarf is best for each one? I particularly like the third style.  I have the problem with them slipping, too, even if I try to pin it in place.
Thank you❤️ Beautiful Sister🫂
How large of a scarf do you recommend?
It not that easy but cute takes practice to get the right length and you need time to do it and undo it, if you don't like it
what are the demensions of the first scarf?
I love these but for some reason i cant seem to make it stay on my head. I feel like its a talent that im missing 😮‍💨
Ok help me please… I’m 60 mixed culture, long story short 😳 What ONE PRODUCT can I use to get that beautiful sleek flat hair?
You are Breath takingly Gorgeous!!¡¡!
Thanks 😊
Beautiful Wraps!!!
Love your vibe , thanks for this !
The truth is the truth. black women are the face of beauty. Not ethnically  ambiguous females. haters gon hate!  Full lips, melanin, coarse hair real beauty. your beauty is defiled like it says in the bible.God doesn't lie!
Very pretty
I love wearing head wraps when my hair isn't as nice. It looks very elegant and simple.
Where can I get headwraps like this
What kind of wraps are those  ? Like what material? All of these are super cute styles 😊
Finally found the trick that I need!! My hair is bleached and I wanna go to the pool often without having to worry about getting it wet!
Great tutorial!
Thank you for this. I've never worn head wraps. I live in the desert now and have to protect my hair from the extreme Sun.
Can you tell me the dimensions of the black scarf you specifically used, because that’s how I would like to style my head wrap but I can’t do it right for the life of me, idk if it’s that I’m using the wrong size or what 🙄
Thank you for this. You make it look very easy but these 4 ways do look good.
How is it staying on though? Through out the day
Get it!!!!!!!😊😊 I am feeling real cute rn!!!! Im finna beat this cancer AND be cute!!!❤❤👑Ty sis✊🏾

I cannot tell you how much better I instantly felt knowing there are cute ways to hide your hair. I'm a teenager struggling from sudden hair loss and I was worried about going out and just literally had a panic attack. I won't lie you probs just saved my life since I'm quite a fashionable person.

Thank you! I feel so beautiful!
My head is so tiny all of these just come off 😩 head bands dont stay so dont know why i thought this would
i have horrible eczema on my scalp. i feel like this would help me from scratching and help with the healing process, but im not sure wearing this would be appropriate. any opinions would be helpful :(
Wow you look a bit like Shakira 😮
So pretty.
didnt even show how the scarf suppose to lay on ur head mine is huge and this did not help
I feel like I am missing steps. I’ve tried all three for at least 2 hours and they don’t come out anywhere close to correct. What am I doing wrong??
This video was more of a demonstration then an informative video. But overall good video.
omg... THANKYOU for this video!!! <3
Thank you for this video!! So helpful.
Hi I have short hair. Can I still wrap my head like the styles you teach in this video?
Thank you!
Can you please tell me where you buy your head scarfs especially the orange color one and the red one?😊
I have a flat head 😂😭 Is it possible for me to do this !? You’re so pretty btw!!!
Thank u so much

i am a cat
That styles doesn't ever wurk for me. Always slides off after 10 minutes.  I believe it's just nice for a few pictures.
Wait!!!  You got to show us what the scarf looks like first!!!!
Honest question, can white women do this? I love doing this after getting out of the shower with a t-shirt but I would love to do it with a wrap but I DO NOT want to offend or do it if I shouldn't.. if someone could just answer this would be so grateful 😊
Is it okay if white people wear this or is this cultural appropriation? If so what is the cultural meaning behind it? I’m interested 😌
"Its not rocket science!" Meanwhile im about to set myself on fire because i cannot for the life of me do it
I've been watching a few of these videos and yours has been the cutest, so far!  Thanks!
Thank you so much for this video! You're so beautiful and the scarves just accent your beautiful face!

You’re so beautiful
Anyone here military? I was told by a girl to find out how to wrap my hair so it doesn’t break off at BMT. Should I do my hair first then wrap it so I don’t have anything to do in the morning as well?
They always slip off my big ass head
Where do you/everyone get their wraps from?  HELP!?! Suggestions, please.
I love it ! Thank you for your help !
I’m very white and have no culture or religion so I feel like it might be offensive if I were to wear a head wrap or scarf. I find them so beautiful, but I’m not sure if it can be worn for style?
How do you get them to stay and not slip?
So pretty
One of the prettiest ladies I’ve seen in my life. No cap 🧢 & thanks sis!
I think head scarfs are gorgeous. I've been wanting to wear one but I am very white. Would it be offensive? I have curly hair and I think these would look nice. But if it is cultural appropriation of course I would never. If any poc have an opinion on this please let me know! Thanks
I know I was thinking the exact same thing. What a beautiful face!!!
Where did you get that first scarf 🥺
lipstick on point 👌❤️
imagine looking that gorgeous i wouldnt know how to act T.T
You are absolutely stunning!
Beautiful.  I love these colors on you.
I don’t wear hijab or am Muslim or anything but I would love to go out with it anyway!!
Perfect for thick curly hair! Love it!
I know it's not rocket science, but I've been wondering how women in my community have been doing that style for over 2 years.  Its finally been answered. I can now go back and fix my community sketches.

Does your wraps slip off cause mines do I get so frustrated
Now do a tutorial on beautiful skin.  Yours is flawless
This is not head band it hijab fo Muslims L
Black women started these scarf wrapping styles because of the TIGNON LAWS. This scarfing is history.
where did you get the pink colored scarf or is it just cut fabric
ADORABLE!
Something I'm wondering: for the third style, how many yards of fabric is the scarf..?  I don't think it'll work with a square scarf
Super cute😍
Who uses scarf’s?
I’m here cus of quarantine
YOUR HAIR IS SO BEAUTIFUL OMG
What size are the scarfs that you use
I love to wear scarves in my hair but I ALWAYS look like a 17th century provincial peasant
You need to explain what type of scarf you need. How long it should be, etc. this doesn’t explain things well at all.
What did you moisturize your hair with? Can you pls write the name of the product.
where did you get your head wraps from
Where did you get that red scarf? 😫😍
You are so beautiful!!!! Wow!
Where did you buy that orange with purple scarf? It’s just beautiful!
Your sooo pretty 😍
The last one caught my eyes. I am going to use that method when I wear helmet.

Wow thanks you made that look really easy... And it is really needed for me with all these zoom calls
I think I’m going to try this out for when I’m abroad in hot countries, I hate my hair out when it’s hot lol 😭 just makes me feel hotter
Maybe helps if your beautiful because I just keep looking like a gypsy ready to tell someone their fortune.
How or will #2 work with short hair?
I know this may sound stupid, but I'm white and thought head wraps would be a cute way to protect my scalp and fragile hair from the sun. My hair is so fine, that the sun can cause breakage. Would it be cultural appropriation if I wrapped my head? I I know it may sound silly, but I greatly respect POC and don't want to be taking something that isn't mine.  I would really appreciate it if some POC commented and educated me. Every place I've looked on the internet is bombarded with white people claiming cultural appropriation doesn't exist. And I strongly disagree.

Yay i wanna try this hope i can pull it off!
Just watched this video while getting ready for work and it turned out perfect! Thank you 😩
mine keeps tryna slip off my head
how are you girls looking so PRETTY with your scarves? When I wear a scar, even a long one, I look...not cute.
Is turban harram ??
You are so beautiful, MashaAllah 🥺✨🧡 these looks are so cute, and gave me plenty of new ideas! Thank you
Very good Ms thang
Is it good to wear scarfs all the time
Girlllll please tell me where you got those scarves ! Or link your favorite ones 💛
currently growing out a pixie cut & honestly this video saved my life
Yahweh has blessed you with such beauty sister.😃
1 Corinthians 11:5 💝
You are soooo beautiful 😮
I'm a white girl from Capetown with naturally curly ass hair, but I'm afraid that if I wear these styles I might offend someone..
She speak Spanis👩🏻😳❤❤
Where do you get your head wraps from?
First of all, turbans and headscarfs are two different things. As an african who come from a culture where we do this every day at home or out for parties, good job. But turbans have nothing to do with headscarfs. Turban is a religious veil used by Sikhs. I see many people call it that but is Africans call it just headscarfs.
What is an ideal size for the scarf?
I hate girl with red lipstick but you rock it😍🔥
I'd look like the pirate from the wiggles trying to wear the last red one🤦🏽‍♀️😭😂
We are all human , let's share and care, peace and love
It suits you
3:55 “see it’s not rocket science”... yess you came through! Thanks sis 💜
you look like Tegan from HTGAWM lol 😍😍
Cute ❤️😄
Man, you are one of the most beautiful humans my little eyes have ever seen!!!
I loved your video. I've always liked to wear turbans, but I didn't know how to tie them to convey personality. Thanks for your help. Long live the blackness !!! greetings from Cuba
Soooo cute! Except when I do it I look homeless 😅
Thank you for ur tutorials I use ur styles even for religious way to cover my hair and it looks amazing
Im a new subbie. Thank you for sharing  this
Is there a specific place you buy your hair wraps from?
Tysm ❤️
Girl you cut out the important parts
Honteeee! You are flawless and I love the tutorials. Time for me to get my fabric weight up!  -Misha Nicole
You're so beautiful!!
I've been always buying those type of scarfs bc they're beautiful af but I feel that I've never looked good in them lol
Thank you very good!
Thank you👌🏾
Okay, honest question: would it be weird if I (a white girl)  wore a head scarf like this?
Lol "it's not rocket science"..... 😫😫 but it is!! My headwrap never stays at the top of my head ☹☹😒
I'm pakistani American and I have wild thick, wavy curly hair and the first one is literally amazing and your tutorial was so easy to follow thank you so much
Omg!!! Wow, it looks so damn gorgeous on you!! How do you do it?! I tried so many times, I want to cry! I can’t get it!
We’re do you buy your scarfs?
You suck you ain’t teach me shit
Ur sooo adorable and ur hait is soo cute
love this! i’m christian and i wear headscarves for modesty purposes 💜
My scarf is not holding up and always slides down from my head :( I tried trying it higher and lower but nothing works. Does anyone has some tips for me, that'd be really great! ❤
How about for waist long dreads?
Ty for my inspiration today
How dose a bald guy get this video as a suggestion lol .beautiful tho
Is it me or she looks like Venessa from high school musicals🙋😅
It's concerning how much people blindly encourage people to wear headwraps in these comments. Though many cultures and religions utilize them differently, please be open and aware. I'll always encourage people to be aware of how you use a style. That's not to say people can't, but yes do homework.
I work in a kitchen and bar with locs and free hair. I struggle finding styles that make me feel cute/professional while on the floor. This video saved me from looking a hot mess. THANK YOU!! 💕
Me: *doesnt have long enough hair for any of these
I love sooo much your tutorials i love wearing head wraps xxxxx ❤😘👍✊
Where do you purchase your scarves?
Love all your headwraps looks beautiful &.that lipstick is everything!!!
I clicked on this thinking I found my go-to lazy hair style, but this requires more hand coordination and skills that I definitely do not possess, imma stick to looking like a homeless with my beanie :’)
I swear I’m doing it as per instructed but why do I look like Professor Quirrell instead..
How can god make these people so beautiful😍😍😍
Love each and every style , thank you so much!💕 Do you have any tips so that the headscarf doesn’t slip or moves around your head?
Where do you buy head scarfs
You look like the dark version of Emma Waston.
So I was hopin someone could tell me cause I don't wanna offend someone by being ignorant, I wanna start wearing hair wraps to cover up my bald ass head, my hair got damaged and needed a cut (it's like pixie cut length) and I wanna cover it as I grow it out but someone told me that I can't wear them cause I'm white and it cultural appropriation. That is the last thing I wanna do, so is there an alternative way to cover my hair or were they wrong??
I don't have enough hair for this! 😂
Thank You. I have a Barbie doll that I want to try those looks on.
You're gorgeous
Just what I was looking for! Tysm, by the way you look amazing in all of them
Informative video. looks quite easy
That exactly my style
You are so gorgeous omg 🤩 I love your lips 👄
Sub cuz you cute
You are very gorgeous. Your hair looks so great. I am jealous.
Looks great but I tried following along & failed miserably! 😔
This was so helpful. Thanks so much lovely!
*i just want to wrap it like a normal human being it doesn't have to be beautiful*
I’m just curious, what is the measurement for your head wraps? I had bought some and they’re pretty prints BUT they seem short...
Your so adorable
I’m Hispanic and I have short hair . Would it be cultural appropriation If i did this hairstyle?😩
Cute!
The second one is my favorite. 😍😍 And the third is like my go to style
i wish I could wear these but I have strick straight hair so idk how
So cute! What kind of scarves are these? Where can I get them from?
Needee this cuz ive been lookin a mess. Thanks sis
Nice.. I’m sure if I do this people would look at me weird..  love this for winter
What lipstick are you wearing? It’s gorgeous!
I was going to complain about why you are showing the lipstick then I saw how gorgeous it is!!! What product did you put in your hair?
I'm not black but i have curly hair and as a curly hair person i have really bad hair days or sometimes i don't feel like having my hair out , is disrespectful if i use a headscarf? I don't want be disrespectful :((

I want to know if wearing your hair in a turban or headscarf is problematic if you’re white (I’m Caribbean) And I really want to know what you guys think of this
Hat was very cute with the scarf..

I love the red style 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍❤❤❤❤💕💕

Just shaved my hair off to donate to the charity about a month ago but it already started growing back real quick to I just do my edges and this head scarf 🧣 saves life
Her: 0:39 me: I like to hide my messy hair
You’re so beautiful! I love your hair and hair wrap ideas!
suppose you dont enough hair for a bun
Tysm! ❤
Amazing mama !! ❤️
Beauty ❤️❤️
Will this work for short hair?I wear twists, my hair is not long
Mann this would be so handy for me. Cause I barely have time to do my hair. But i really don't know where I can get them
I love both that are placed at the top of your head...great video hun
Omg...why so pretty? Dios te bediga. Thank you for sharing.
cute giiiiirl! thanx for the tips!
I have alopecia areata this tutorial really helped give me a confidence boost! Thank you!
I want to start wearing something like this for religious reasons and this has been helpful thank youuu
The bun anchors the scarf in place. Need some looks for shorter hair, please.
It's Rocket Science!  JK 👀
Amazing video! ✨
Thanks for sharing this video. Your so pretty 😘
DIY to prevent your scarf from slipping + HOW to style them for SHORT HAIR💕 https://youtu.be/e-Zc5lvGRH8
R u Dominican ?
okay so I'm so confused so the first one is what im trying to accomplish but I literally can't it looks we have the same type of scarf but I think you're doing a step I'm missing because I can't even make it past step one one LMAO.
Beautiful.
Love it, you look beautiful ☺
IS it possible to do this if we have short hair, no bun?
No such thing as culture appropriation for hair!! Do wtf you like white girls don’t own blonde hair and black girls don’t own head scarfs or Afros etc👌
And so is the back ground music a subliminal?🤔
Greetings from 2019!  Love your headwrap ideas/ tutorial.  Thanks for sharing!
I appreciate this video. I've alt had long hair down to my booty lol. Yesterday I decided to be spontaneous and had my hair cut to what your hair length is. And just now I reaffixed i realized idk how to tie my hair when its short lmao. And how to wear a hijab anymore. So I YouTubed it and found your video. So thank you for the help!
Thank you for posting. This was so easy to grasp, I am now a fan of headwraps.
I always look at girls with scarves on their heads and say how do they do that?! Thanks for the video!! Looks pretty easy!!
What kind of scarfs are these? She keeps talking about extra fabric. Extra fabric where? I'm out
The best tips. Thank U very much!
I’m going to try this today 🥰
Nooooo,i love love your hair!!!
You’re so naturally pretty 😩😍💕
You’re so prettyyyy😍😍😩
Is it okay if a brown person wear this?
Thanks a lot just two weeks ago I got a pixie cut but I regret is because my hair is thick with curls so every morning i wake up with an afro, so I want to start covering my hair until it grows back, plus I am tired of people commenting on my haircut and having to wet it every morning to style it
thanks girl
So easy looking and beautiful
Thanks! xo blessings to you and your family!
I would love to do this but would it be cultural appropriation? I dont want to be disrespectful! 🙏
Makes you look so royal sis... throw in a beautiful, long,  free flowing skirt and you will slay like a real princess.
I need a hijab the color of the red satin one legit it’s so nice
My great grandmother used to wrap her hair similar to this (she was Native American, Indigenous to Panama) we normally wrap our hair like the first and last styles 😊❤ I've just started to wrap my hair when it's really bad weather lol mine seems to loosen a lot so these tips helped so much :)
I sooo loved the silk red scarf u put on at the end, plus the hat for addition. You rock ! Me n my man are going to a Renaissance Festival soon across the street where we live and I have all that I need to wear. I just need to practice putting on the scarf.
Beautiful! I've always wanted to get the head wrap look down... but it always looked messy on me.. You make it look super easy..gonna keep at it.. anyone else here in 2019?
You are sooo beautiful !
I need some advice, I'm so sorry to be one of those people but I'm a Latina, mostly Mexican and Salvadorian can I wear these? She looks bomb af and I love it (you go girl) but I'm afraid I might offend someone and I do not want to be taking advantage of anyone's culture gracias cuates!
😍😍😍😍
Maybe I have a conehead or something because EVERY time I put a scarf on any way it slides off, down and/or up in 2 seconds.....and my hair is not smooth so I duno....Feel like I need to glue it in or something!
Beautiful eye lashes <3
I feel like I can't go to work with my scarf on but this helps a lot. I've been struggling with wearing it hijab style. I don't want people thinking I'm a Muslim (no offense to Muslims). I just want to cover my hair so I don't have to keep damaging it all the time.
What size are those scarves?  Can you give the dimensions?  I appreciate it.
The red one is my favorite 😍😍
How big is your scarf
I live in Barbados... I NEEDED this😩
Love this! Very informative :)
Can i sample yoy
Omg youre so pretty
wow girl you are absolutely gorgeous ! love the vid 💞
Cute
You are such a beautiful girl and this is a great video
How do you keep it from slipping the fuck off
My God you hair is terrible, no wonder you hide it, i know a couple of shampoos and conditioners that will help with your dry thick afro hair, cut it all off NOW
I've been obsessed with wearing head scarves since I was a young girl. I usually just throw it around my head but now as an adult, I've finally been looking for actual styles that I can use. Lazy hair day = Head scarf day 🙌🏻
Thank you- I recently discovered all the ways bandanas and such look good on me , a white woman. I wouldn't want to go too far with the African look because I would feel like a wannabe; but you are 100% correct about the 'bold lip'- I had to be fifty to discover that! God bless you. young lady!
Love #3
Omg you're damn beautiful young lady !
Im headed to Morocco soon and want to respect the culture while lookin cuuute. The first one will for sure be a regular for me.
I wanted to wear head scarves because too many people see me for just my hair. People stop me on the street just to say nice hair! I'm flattered but my hair is just my hair and I don't style it at all so I'm not trying to get attention. For a while I put my hair in a bun or ponytail but it's heavy and hurts my head. I can't braid or I'd wear it in French braids. I want to cover my hair and keep it for me. It's a personal conviction and I don't care if anyone gets offended.
I absolutely love those scarves! Where did you get them
What kind of lipstick is that??
I love your YouTube videos.  Just wanted to say I love you so much
iv been trying sooo many turbans and this video just made my day  everytime i try to do a turban its never proper secure and this just solves all my problems
I just discovered I have alopecia and I'm so sad cause there's literally not a single strand of hair left on the side of my head and this tutorial saved my life!!!
Marry me 😍❤️
Love it. You do this because you have a beautiful face.
What size is the fabric
damn girl u so fine 😍😍
Great video!
gorgeous
I’m recently into headwraps/turbans & this is AMAZING😍
Does anyone have issues with the wraps slipping back? Am I doing something wrong?
What’s the brand and color of that lipstick 😩🙌🏽❤️
where do you normally buy your scarfs? They're so pretty!
you're so pretty!!
Wear what you want!!! We are brother and sister!!!! No appropriation!! You like it, you find it beautiful, live your life!!!
THANK U FOR THIS
First I love your hair 😍
I can to understand the struggle but your hair is gorg
I definitely love wraps #2 & #3 💕
U so pretty the pink scarf look is my fave look x
Which size scarf would be best for this?
Where did you get the head scarf for the second style you did? The black and gray one that you tie in the back.
Does anyone know where I can find cute  scarfs like the black and grey one she used for the low bun ??
Love your lipstick color.
Omg ladies don't attempt this while you're having your period i tried and failed miserably and i am so fucking pissed😫😫😂😂
HAIR TWIN
You’re LIPSTICK 😍
Where did you buy your headscarves?
Whats the name brand of your lipstick?
Your face is perfect. I don't care if white people wear headwraps. Doesn't bother me. Just don't act like you originated it or came up with something new....
Puerto Rican culture does this and I really wanna wear this out but I'm too pale to look very hispanic so I'm sure someone's gonna call me out for wearing it and doing the cursed "cultural appropriation" :/
Damn anyone knows where I could find this orange and purple head scarf ? 😍
I’m in the last one right now and have been for like a week lol I’m sooooooo lazy
Come over and try my videos
So stunning, thanks so much! <3
That first wrap is absolutely stunning!  Are you using scarves?  Or actual fabric?  If fabric what dimensions do I know how much to purchase?
U are so fucking beautiful
That lip colour....
Nice 👍
So cute! What's the name of the lipstick again?
I love the 1st look and the 2nd to last.  My hair has been braided for 2 weeks and it's time to take it down and wash it. Unfortunately it is in the middle of a work week so I'm going to need that style for tomorrow and Thursday.  Great tutorial.   Can't pass up an opportunity to plug while on here so go to barnes&noble.com and check out my work under Tonya Young #readabook
so beautiful
Very Beautiful & Sweet!💐
I’m Latina would it be culture appropriation if I tried this?
Can someone not just wrap their hair if they want? I don't understand the cultural appropriation of just wearing it. If someone who wasn't Muslim said they were wearing a hijab and not a headscarf it is understandable. But like I just want to protect my hair cus the weather is super harsh.
Damn u bad lil mama
My favourite was the red one!!! Omggg I loveddd it since Red is my favorite colour 😂😂😂
Hey, I’m white and I’ve been thinking about wearing a headscarf tied like a turban. Do y’all think this would be cultural appropriation or just inappropriate? Just curious so please don’t get mad
Your make up is Fire
Where do you get your wraps?
what material is best to wear so that the high wrap styles don't slip off?
SHE'S SOOOO PRETTY!!
U supernaturally beautiful
I LOOOOVE the Ankara one, very African ( I’m African) ❤️
This just saved me 😊😊😊😊
well alright! U go! honey Chile!😁😁😘like ya style
Omg. This was super simple! I was definitely overthinking it. Thanks so much for this tutorial. 💖
Lol at first I thought u were a Jewish married woman wearing a tichel
yesss Israelite women are supoosed to wrap up our hair and cover it
Latino home all the way, they got that tejido cortina over the shower curtain. 💚It
Same name!! Ahh and you're so pretty😙 love your video
what kind of scarfs do you need in size? a normal one, head scarf?  i dno what size to buy as i have a pea head and also thin hair thanks lol
I did the first one and I love how it looks on me . Thank you ❤❤❤❤
How large should it be for a whole head covering turban ?
I’ve watched this videos plenty of times because you’re fab and look even more fab with this lip color so I made up my mind and put an order in for it!! Luckily it was in stock and for just $23!!  Keep doing you!! Keep up the videos!! You are a goddess!! ❤️
You look so gorgeous. I was wondering would it be cultural appropriation if I wanted to try this out? (I am white btw)
Nice music
Advice on where to find good scarfs?
U're so pretty
See when people ask me about natural god given beauty , I want people to recommend this near flawless lady right here . You are the textbook definition of beauty and you further reinforce it without even trying you don't use your body or any gimmicks to accentuate it. Whoever manages to cuff you is a lucky man because your seemingly laid back warm personality compliments that gorgeous face of yours
Hey uhh... So loved the video😘. Especially the one with the style that looked like kente cloth. I was wondering if you give me the measurements of the cloth you used in i think the second to last wrapping style. The thing is i have this big gigantic peice of kente cloth and i wanted to use some to make a head wrap, and when i saw your video it was like the perfect one. So i was hoping you reply and tell me the measurements of that scarf so i can cut it the right length and width so that i can do the same style as you showed in the video. It would be a great help to have the measurements ro kinda guide me and thank you for posting this video, it was a big help and fun watch. Thanks
Glad go finfina you
I dont have enough hair on my head to create these 😭😭
can i do this if im white?
What are the dimensions of the scarf you used here?
Love this video 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 Thank u for sharing up hun  Keep Shinning up 👏🏽🙏🏾☺️
You are beautiful!!! These are some very pretty styles!! Please do more! And the lipstick is popping! I love it. What color is the lipstick. It would look amazing on me lol. 😍

How can she b so perfect tf
Nice wraps👍🏼
Love you lipstick ❤️
Oooo someonr tell me where i can get one like the red one she has😍
Can someone explain to me what exactly should be bad about "cultural appropriation"? Really i Think that is a Term you only hear from Americans.
Wow, que bella! The red lips are stunning!
She’s so beautiful 😍😍😍
Number 1 was my favorite every day...quick fix  .  Number 2 with dangle or hoop earrings
So I wanna thank you Chile!!! I got a twofer! I searched for How to with Head wraps and I got a new lipstick! Quiet Riot looks great on me!!  Thanks harmonicurls!!
Where do you get the scarfs ?
You kinda look like Shakira I don't now why🤗
You are so beautiful!
I WANT A DATE.
Where do you get your scarf
You are so pretty!
How do you get it to not slip off? When ever I do wraps it slips off bc my hair is nappy and soft at the same time.
what if you don't have a lot of hair. can you still do the second wrap?
oh my god your hair is so amazing ah i'm in love *^*
Where did you get those head wraps in your video from? I really love that 2nd one!
It’s crazy how that scarf and some lip stick changes a girl . Lol tomorrow’s hairstyle ❤️
The red style reminds me of a pirate
i love how headscarfs and turbans look its sooo cute! esp love the third style. wish i could rock them without people getting pissed lol (i'm white but also have crazy curly hair!)
You are gorgeous sweetheart. Really sweet.
firstly, you are so beautiful, oh my goodness! secondly, thank you for this video. I seriously needed it!
What about if you don’t have a buns?
I wore the last one and I was told I looked like a pirate
I’m Filipino part and I’ve been seeing so many Filipinos rocking head scarves i wanna try it for myself and all your tutorials are so easy to follow I love them 💗💗💗
So beautiful
Mine always slips off my head ☹️
Thank you! Out of all the video's have seen yours is the best! U make it simple & clear. I have locs so it's been hard trying to wrap my scarfs! Ty!!
where do u get ur wraps from??
Pero where did you get these head wraps?
You're probably the most gorgeous person ive ever seen!
+harmonicurls Are you a Muslim?🤔🤔
How have I not known this channel its fantastic.
girl, you are so beautiful and funny and confident!
Ur voice is so cute! Loved this video, subscribed x
2:06 for the actual wrapping tutorial.
lmao i thought this was a hijab tutorial at first and you also look arab so i was confused but this is a cute vid
Where did you get the fisrt one from?
Your first scarf where can I find it or similar to it?
thus video just saved my hair it dries out so bad when i sleep😍😍
Love it!
yes it is cultural appropriation depending of how you wear it and the type of fabric you used. And people are saying it's not. Well of course it's never wrong when you like it but white but labelling other culture style as tribal is okay. IT is just so weird when white people start doing things all of sudden  " yeah it's not just black/arabic/etc... that do it" people will start talking about century yaka yaka...I'm half African (guinea) and Italian. I embrace every side of me and I know my african heritage since my mom is black....And no the origin is from africa, even their fabric is made for. Do nit start comparing this to nun, or esmeralda or hijab it's not even the same way my mom tied her scarf. So please....
YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL!!
she kinda looks like shakira
I WISH I HAD AFRO HAIR TT
I LOOOOOOVE your red lipstick 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
my god you are the epitome of beauty.
Beautifulll ❤️
I have those same exact headphones and they look the same exact way
puedes hacer el tutorial de ese make up pleeeaaceeeeee
looks really nice with those earrings
Where do you get your scarfs from ?
you’re so beautiful! x
First one !!!! Love it
I want to do this so badly, but I dont think it would look good on me. Maybe I will try it anyway. I have a crap ton of hair and maybe this will help to stop overheating? Any ideas?
Je t’aime
Ahhh I just started and your so pretty and sweet girl!!! Aww lol
Im a white latina with straight hair, can I pull this off?
B
Estas hermosa -saludos desde MEXICO.
Hey! So, is this not heavy on your head? I wanna start wearing them but I'm afraid it's gonna be pulling my head back... thanks for the tutorial :)
Hi ! Where can i find a brush like yours please?
you look like betty boop! loved the video ;p
ha ella sale fácil y rapido,  yo soy una terrible
Where do you get your scarves?
Me encanta tu pelo!!!😍
hullo i really love these but i'm white and i was wondering if wearing these would be seen as cultural appropriation or if it's ok, because i want to respect the origins and not offend anyone.
Tenía curiosidad por poner los subtítulos en español (aunque entienda perfectamente lo que dices en inglés) y no quiero ofenderte ni que te lo tomes a mal pero deberías intentar escribir sin tantos errores... Hay bastantes cosas que hacen daño a la vista😅 Te lo digo como crítica constructiva para que intentes mejorar como alguien cuya primera lengua es el español no para burlarme o algo así 😅😅
😍😍😍
Omg you look like Anastasia Romanov from the movie “Anastasia”
You’re beautiful!!!!!!
where can I buy these kind of scarfs/head wraps??
How do u keep ur scarfs from slipping off your head?? Every time I go to tie or wrap the scarf slides right off my head, and i find that the scarfs slip off my head during the day. I've tried bobby pins but still not working.
Where can I find some basic headscarves because I really like these looks but can never find the scarves? (like in stores because ordering things is hard sometimes)
I'm probably the whitest you can be, but yesterday I wore a headscarf because my hair was greasy af (and it actually looked so cool) do you think it would be ok for me to wear it out the house? or would it offend people? idk it sounds stupid but I don't wanna start any fights
I really want to try this and where this but I am white. Is it okay if I where a head wrap or not? Is it cultural appropriation?
How do u get it to not slide of ur head
You are sooooo gorgeous
Thank you for this 💙💙😌
omg you’re so pretty
Can you tell me what size are the head wraps?  Are they always one size?  Thanks.
I have bangs :(
beautiful👏
Me encantaaaa
So pretty
Love your styles,and accent🤗🙂
Where do you get your scarfs???
i don't wanna sound dumb but.. is this cultural appropriation? i think this looks fantastic but I don't wanna offend anyonet (im Hispanic btw and from what i know i dont have African descent. )
Red surf 4 shore
Your absolutely gorgeous BTW
Now i only need to buy a  scarf haha
ME HE ENAMORADO DE TI AY
You're gorgeous, love the pink scarf and look! Thanks for sharing. ❤️✨
The second look with that mauve colored scarf was BOMB 😍
Queen 🙏🏽❤️
I look like a woman in her midlife crisis who went to Africa for a few weeks and now goes shopping for her organic raw vegan diet...
Yay just what I needed
What are the best kind of scarves to buy for headwraps?
Video starts at 2:13 x
Loveee ! What kind of camera do you use to shoot your videos ?
I have a weird question, would it be rude or disrespectful if someone who wasn’t of specific cultures or religions to wear hear wraps because I’m only Native American but I love the way these look and I have super curly hair that I’d love to rock looks like these. Someone help me out I don’t want to end up disrespecting someone
These are so cute. I love the tall wrap around one best. I can’t wait to try it out. I never know what to do on bad hair days. And I think this will work perfectly
You are so sexy
Absofreakinglutely gorgeous❣️
Your so pretty😤❤
#3 love
That looks so good but how do I do this with my short hair! 😭😭
If i am white and i wear this, is that considerated cultural apropiation?
U made them so simple👏🏽👏🏽
You look sooooo beautiful, hi from Peru 😻
for those asking about appropriation, i’d suggest not wearing the headscarf in a turban-like fashion. other styles like the first and last one in this video are ok for everyone, but please remember that black and brown people especially are still seen as “terrorists” and/or “uncultured tribal people” for wearing turbans and certain headscarf styles
U r fckn gorgeous!!!
What is the name of that red lipstick your wearing
Dios mío te amo... But those amazing buns can I actually use with straight Argentinian hair like mine? ^.^
What lipstick ?
Me quedé un rato trabada al final Jajajajaja al escuchar  "porque está muy oscuro", y yo en plan descifrando qué podía ser en inglés, pensando que había escuchado mal😂😂😂😂🔝🔝
You are so pretty !!
You are probably one of the most beautiful women I have ever seen.  Nice tutorial too...
Hey! I love this! Can I as a white person wear this or would it be cultural appropriation? Like I'd love to try it but I don't want to do anything wrong :)
Girl I love it! 😍 Can I pull this off if I’m Hispanic??? 🤔 or would that be culturally wrong? I’ve done this before & it looked good, buuuuut I didn’t strut out like that. What do y’all think? Can Hispanic women do this yes or no?
Please!!!!!!do a makeup tutorial on this look!!!!💜
YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL & I LOVE YOUR ACCENT OMG
Looks gorgeous on you!
So beautiful 😍
Love some of these they look like Tichels, (Jewish head scarf)
Hi! You look absolutely stunning in those headscarves. I'm Mexican and totally want to try to rock this look. Do you think it would be offensive if i wore a scarf like this? Thanks :)
what shape scarves are u using? t
you're so beautiful
Where do you get your scarfs from?
i loveee these! theyre so gorgeous😍😍 i wish i could do this, but i feel like people woulf make fun of me😪
me subscribí solo porque hablaste en español al final but i love the headwraps imma do the red one for today😍😍👏🏽👏🏽
There is a difference between head scarves and turbans. Do you not seeing you classifying it as such as cultural appropriation? Did you look up the definition of a turban? It’s sad that you used cultural appropriation to get more views 🤦‍♀️
omg you are soooo pretty
damn you’re so prettybb
🖐🏼🤗💕
I loved the second style but then I saw how you did it and got sad because 1) my hair is straight. 2)I shaved my hair lol xD You look cute in all styles. Thank you for the video
Hey girl heey new subbie here! Me encanto el segundo y el tercero! Mi pelo natural esta en un length super raro so headwraps will become my bestie for a bit jaja me encanto el video! Keep going & exito, chula! #AfroLatina #Boricua!
Where did you get the third scarf??? It's gorgeous!!!
Question: I’ve always wanted to try headwraps/turbans, but I’m afraid of people judging me or saying something to me about how I can’t wear one because I’m white. Is it okay to wear these if I’m white? Thanks and awesome video ✨
Your hair looks gud in the beginning...pouffy hair trend🤔
For people who are afraid for cultural appropration. In every century and culture people wore it for fashion,religion or protection. R ember, women in medieval europe and middle east wore often headscarfs :)
where can i buy an all black one?
Girlllllll but what lippie is that?!😍
If you have to ask if it's cultural appropriation to wear a head wrap, it more than likely is. If it's a part of your culture, you never have to ask. There's a lot of white, non-hijabis saying it isn't, but literally how would you know??
You’re stunning 🧡
haz un tutorial de como te pintas los ojos como en este vídeo .. plixx
omg please do a makeup tutorial on this !!!! i’ll sell my soul to satan pleaseeeeeeeeee
Where do you buy your head scarfs
I was literally speechless when I saw you , you’re the definition of gorgeous!
I wanna wear head wraps but I don't know if it's cultural appropriation. I'm mestiza.
You’re beautiful and you have great content. I’m so glad I came across your channel
Omg your scarves look so nice and your makeup is so smooth!
girl you’re so beautiful omg😂 your teeth, nose, lips... everything! you look a little like Eisa/Eiza(?) Gonzales!
K linda..😍
You are so beautiful 😍 ❤️❤️
beautiful!!!!
What types of fabric do you use? Do you ever wear a satin cover under any of your wraps?
this has been a life saver! thanks harmoni xoxo
May you View my video on my channel
Where did you get your scarfs from ?
I'm white....while you look breathtaking I feel that would look so bizarre on me :(
Ok. Time to grab a scarf.
BEAUTY
New subbie
do they slide off easily
Estee Lauder's Quiet Riot, thanks for this.  I needed a really nice shade of red.😀
I’ve got curly hair and I really like the thought wearing head scarfs but I wanna know if that would be cultural appropriationy lmao, don’t wanna be doing something and looking problematic and silly

Lipstick looks fabulous on you as well as the head scarves... BTW, don't know if you have the LUSH store near year, and whether's it's just seasonal for wrapping products, but they have some beautiful inexpensive wraps up there they you could also use as head scarves. Merry Christmas!!
