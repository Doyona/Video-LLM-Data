i am dying my boyfriend hair 😂
I assume you don't need a developer  with manic panic? I've never used it
I did everything the video mentioned and bleached my hair b4, made sure to get it all washed off and dried completely then applied your blue steel dye and it didnt absorb whatsoever mann im so hurt
Man, I didn't realise there was a whole process to it... definitely going to have to ask for help with this.
I bought my mom purple haze from manic panic
Can we dye our dark brown hair(asian) without bleach?how long does it last for
Love manic panic products! Tish and Snookys shop was shown in nelson sullivans video.
I use Cotton Candy Pink,I love it :)
Omggggggggh I love you guysss❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

Dyeing hair in a completely white room. That's a great idea!
💚💚💚💚💚👍
I recently bleached and dyed my hair a few weeks ago using Splat brand hair dye and the green color that came out was not what was shown on the box. As a matter of fact it was the exact shade of blue/teal that I have been seeing very frequently around my area and I wonder if others have had the same problem. My hair has started fading to the bleach now and I'm about to use Manic Panic Enchanted Forest to try and fix it. Wish me luck.
Using the rockabilly blue to try to get Chloe Price hair. Thank you so much for this video you guys
Just you girls on Nelson Sullivan’s video
I didn't know these women created "Manic Panic". Glad it's not some bald guy in a suit👴🏻. Love that these women are not afraid to wear vibrant colors too.
https://youtu.be/A12Wc547PWY  Can someone please notice my video and help me out to get more subs and views? :)))) It's about my hair transformation ofc with manic panic
Holy shit, I'm here on December 30, 2017 this video was made in December 31, 2013. Wowser.
I dyed my Grandma's hair pink. She was jealous of my hair and wanted a pop of colour too!😂💕
I'll be using After Midnight on natural, curly, black/dark brown hair. I've used a burgundy (also semi permanent) from a different company and loved the tint it gave my hair. Hoping for some awesome results
Will this work on natural grey hair?
I can't wait  to dye my hair with this!!
Cool video! I just made a video for my mom with all her different styles using Manic Panic. She uses it all the time!
Ladys you rock
Worked ^_^ I feel super edgy nowl!
Mum wasted $60 on this hair dye yesterday 😔 I was going pink, but we read the "wash hair with shampoo and then apply to dry hair" as towel dry😞 So now I understand that my hair was supposed to be actually dry... And I feel stupid asf wasting my mum's money on something we didn't read properly😭
I tried ultra violet on my channel :D
I love that it lasts 4-6 weeks. I want to change my hair a lot so it's perfect

Hey manic panic! I was wondering what you would recommend to have really dark blue hair, my hair is naturally black.
How do you tell if the bleach is out of your hair
How many bottles/pots did you use? And can I mix the amplified dye with the classic one? This is really important, someone please answer😬
is color applied to damp or dry hair
since manic panic isnt really supposed to damage your hair an it vegan would it be ok to redo your hair with it every week?
hey manic panic I was wondering what color you would recommend if you want dark red hair?
There is no ammonia in this product, right?
OG girl gang ❤️
Hi, do you have any temporary hair dyes? Xxx
I tried using vampire red on my black hair and I left it on for about 45 minutes and followed the instructions but it still came out very very subtle to the point where you can't see it unless you look very closely. I'm not willing to bleach my hair at any cost so my friend recommended this product to me but I'm wondering if I'm doing something wrong or if I should leave it in longer, I'm not really sure?
Hello I just recently dyed my hair with the manic panic purple haze. Since then my hair always leaves a residue on my skin. How do I fix this?
hi manic panic. I'm using violet right now and I can't wait to get more and get the results on this purple one thanks for the hair dye it'll be good too use on a special occasion too
Hi.. I am planning to make my hair gray/white using a blue steel Manic Panic.. Do I have to mix a "white conditioner" to the manic panic product? ive seen some videos doing that? or can i apply the product right away? currently have a bleached hair. thanks
I have black hair and I want to dye it dark blue without bleaching it. How can I do? Will this work if I apply the dye and let it on long enough??  :)
i'm wanting to dye my hair fuschia shock, and i'm wondering if i can bleach my hair with another brand called nice'n easy. will the color still be okay or do i HAVE to use manic panic bleach? also, how long does fuschia last in hair?
I wanna dye my hair blue but my hair color is medium brown !
My hair is shocking fuchsia and i love it!
can I use the bleach with other hair dyes besides manic panic?
I dyed my son's hair (he's a dark blonde) the electric lizard and it barely stuck 😩 what did I do wrong? We left it on for 30mins but after he washed it out, there's not even a tint.
I love manic panic hair dye it's just that every time I wash my hair all of the color comes out and I need to re-dye my hair again.
Also is there any way to dye my hair near the roots but not actually dye the roots?
Could I just dye my hair back to brown if this stays in longer than I want?
Hi so I have blond ombre hair and I want to put on the Blue Moon one will it take the blond out too?
hi i dyed my hair red a while back during the summer once it was pretty then before school i dyed it again got in trouble dyed it again and its still red  ut its been i think 2-4 months maybe not exactly sure but i asked someone how long it took to fade and she said it took forever and if you look at my google pic on here its blond with natural highlights and i also had blue on the bottom three weeks before i fully dyed my hair red and i wanna know hoe long it will fully take to fade can you help me ???blues gone of course but its been red for a while!!
Hello! I really want to dye my hair using manic panic. It is between dark brown and blonde depending on the section of hair. It is also VERY CURLY. Will it damage my curls?
What do you do if you want to change to another color later? I am thinking of doing some blue over the next 2 months then want to go back to a purple or red later. Do I have to do anything special to change to a new color?
It's gonna work on grey hair or not? As I just want to cover my grey hair roots.
⬅ I used ultra voilet on my hair that was slightly blue and it turned out just like rockabilly blue. It was awesome!!! Now I bleached my hair completely and am using ultra violet on completely bleached hair. I am going to leave it on for about three and a half to four hours. I'm super excited for the results!
I'm dying mine with vampire red right now but my hair never got frothy? I used enough to cover all of my hair but even when i worked it in it didn't get frothy. How do I make it frothy/ does it need to be frothy for my hair to come out correctly?
does dark blue and/or purple work on brown hair
I just bought my first jar of Manic Panic...Thank you so much for this tutorial!
About how long would ultra violet last on bleach blonde hair? Also is it truly temporary or will i have to re-bleach my hair?
I love the Fuschia Shock and follow the instructions to a T, but for some reason it never gets frothy when I work it in, but it will froth up when I rinse. Did I buy a bad batch?  It comes out looking great but only lasts a few days before the first wetting/shampooing then half of it washes out.  Normally I have a medium brown hair but had it treated so most of it is bleached to a blonde(roots)/strawberry blonde/light rust(ends) so not sure if that's why it's not frothing. *shrugs*
I tried it on my hair and I could not see the color, does it work on ethnic hair?....Do I have to bleach first? what did I do wrong?
<----- See my profile pic? I used Manic Panic Atomic Turquoise. 10/10 would recommend.   I just hear a lot of people complain about Manic Panic's results. People who got bad results did not follow the instructions. Just wanted to set the record straight ^___^ I love your product!
I  love manic panic!! I been using this product and I love it!
I love my shocking blue hair it just turns everything my head touches blue
im gna buy manic panic but im not sure which colour to get blue or pino
I am putting Shocking Blue on natural blonde, how will it show up and how long do I let the dye stay in?
Do you have to leave it for 24 hours? If not, how long do you have to leave it on for (the shortest)?
If you have dark black hair.. Will I need to bleach to get the bright colour. I'd like to go for the purple colour. Andwhat will happen if I apply on my red hair? I wanted purple
I don't know if you said how long but, how long do you keep it in your hair? Also how long does it stay in your hair (when you don't get chlorine)
will Rockabilly Blue show up on my hair. its a natural dark brown...but i want a dark almost navy blue..will that work?
my hair color is a really dark brown , almost black . what colors would look good for my hair without bleaching it ?
If you let the dye in your hair for like, hours, will it last more washes?
Will it still work if you dont bleach your hair?
IMPORTANT QUESTION!!!!!!! Does heat straitening your hair fade the colour???????
when washing out dye what shampoo and  conditioner should I use?
Would 1 tub be enough for waist length hair?
What's the best shade to put on dark brown / black hair ?

Does any of your colors work on brown hair? I don't want to bleach it if I dot have to :) My hair is not very dark but it is a tiny bit red because I dyed my hair red about a year ago
( not first time dying it)but I dyed my hair on my own for the first time. love manic panic now, looks great. I did harley quinn suicide squad. I used bad boy blue and cotton candy pink. I love it!!!!!
so... what if you don't want to bleach your hair.... will the color still show?
Hi I used manic panic purple haze and it looked gorgeous. But after you dye it, do you rinse it with shampoo? My color came out in two days when i showered once. Please recommend me a certain shampoo that won't wash out. Thank you!
is coming here because this is probably the only hair dye I will ever use
I used toner but it did only a TINY LITTLE THING. :( My hair is yellowish blonde will cotten candy pink work on that still???
I will try manic panic looks so cool and without damaging hair rate it five stars!
I love Atomic Turquoise, but due to my work i cant dye my hair the new blue colors, I also keep getting told by my hair stylist that I shouldn't use manic panic....
Do you have a pink colour not too "flashy" but still light?
will this be okay to go over henna done hair.
since the die is vegan is the bleach vegan
Can we get white hair if applied white color after bleaching kit?
+manic panic do you have eany tips to split dyeing your hair?
Manic Panic, where in South Africa do you have the store?
I bought the violet velvet, but I don't want to bleach my hair. Will it show up ok on brown hair?

If you bleach your hair and dye it rockabilly blue, when the blue fades, will the blonde hair come back so you can dye it green?
Hi, I'm wondering, which hair colors looks more blond, Electric Banana or Yellow Sunshine?
So do you add anything to the dye while putting it on your hair? or just the dye...

Hello Manic Panic ladies. So when I dyed my hair with Manic Manic Rock a Billy Blue & Ultra Violet, once I rinsed it out and stuff, wherever I sat or layed down (even with my own fingers) it would stain everything that dye got into??? Why???
Manic Panic, do you have any stores in South Africa or only 1, in which ever country you live in?
please someone can put subtitles or traduce only the steps :( ....sorry for my bad english :D

my hair is almost black do u recommend bleaching it? cause i want my hair half black and half blue
Hey :) do you think that if I take natural red hair and dye it all black, with pastel atomic turquoise tips, no bleach, will it turn out okay, and will the red come back? Also should I make sure not to go near my root so it doesn't grow in black? Thanks so much :)
I love how it only lasts 4-6 weeks. It's something my patents will actually let me do
Do you mix this with anything??
I've used the atomic turquoise for about three years now. I managed to convince my grandma to have a few strands of turquoise and now you will always see her with fresh turquoise in her hair :)
You should film a tutorial on mixing the pastelizer and what amounts to use for certain colors and outcomes.
What does Hot Hot Pink look like?  Manic Panic I'm gonna dye my hair Hot Hot Pink and I need to know, When you put the color in, what does it look like when rinsed out? Light Pink, Medium Pink, Magebta , Pinkish Purple Ombre? How much do you have to put in? I'm confused. I saw vids of people dye their hair Hot Hot pink and eachvid showed a different pink with the same dye.
How long do you leave the bleach inn??
Heya! I've never fully dyed my hair before but I have had blonde highlights throughout the years. My hair is a thick choppy pixie cut, and is a mixture of light and dark blonde. I have used some semi- permanent dye before for highlights, but it never lasted long and it was always very faded and dark. I've always wanted blue or pink hair but everyone has said that the only way I can have it is by bleaching my hair... So far, everyone I have asked has said to never bleach your hair if you can.   My questions are: If I bleach my hair, will it thin out? And, Is there any other way, other than bleaching, I could dye my hair blue or pink?  Sorry for the long comment! Hope you reply.  =)  Thanks
+Manic Panic
I have really dark hair what color should I get
do you guys add conditioner in?
My hair is dark brown, will one application of the flash lightning bleach it enough to get white hair using Virgin Snow?
I'm the same age as these stylists, and I want to know if there are special recommendations for those of us with gray hair. My hair is brown and gray, and I don't want to bleach.  I'm thinking of using Fuchsia Shock.  I'm hoping I'll get a variegated effect as it dyes the brown subtly, and the gray will show as pink highlights.   Any tips that would help?
Is the bleach semi permanent too? I know, I sound really stupid LOL.
I aspire to be as cool as them

i got dark brown hair and want to have aa very dark red color in hope that it would be a bit darker then the ppl who have highlighted/bleached it but if i want the color vampire red, do i have to bleach?
I bought Rock 'N Roll Red today and I have light-medium brown hair and I'm not allowed to bleach, I'm aware that it probably won't do that much to my hair now after reading comments, so to maybe make it stay or show up better should I use heat? And let it sit longer? Thank you!
My hair is in the process of dyeing I have ultra violet in my hair, it's only on the bottom of my hair about 2-3inches and I'm really scared I hope it turns out nice. I didn't bleach it, I have dirty blonde-light brown hair

+Manic Panic , can you apply on the scalp without danger , cause I have a bottle of the original semi-permanent color cram , and it says : do not apply on your scalp , but I saw many videos , including yours, appling it on the scalp , ??
I'm just wondering if i need to bleach it and 46 weeks is 10 months, Jenna Marbles uses it and it lasts on her for like 3-5 months
I really liked the video, but the only problem is that her hair isn't a level 7 to 8. It's at least a level 9 maybe even a 10
so
Beautiful color. Nice video.

Hi there! =) During 23 years of my life I dyed my hair - different kind of product and colors you can imagine i did. lol Last year, because of pregnancy, i had to stop 100% of using chemicals in my hair.    I discovered today the Vegan MANIC PANIC!!! Seemed to be a (more) natural product, I´m amazed!  I bought the Shockin Blue but I still Breastfeed my baby. Because of that, I´m NOT gonna bleach my hair (it´s a dark hair with some whites - but less than 10% - which I think it´s gointo give diferent shades on color).  My question is:  Is there anything that NOT  recommends using MANIC PANIC While Breastfeeding (like heavy metals in the composition, etc.)?    Hopping to hear from you soon! hugs, Mary
what colour does tish have in her hair?

Hello! I have very thick, light ginger hair and am looking to dip dye it either Purple Haze or Wildfire Red (any help on the colour choice is greatly appreciated). Would I need to bleach the area I want to dye first or not? As I say I'm quite ginger but not too dark. My hair is also in really good condition at the moment after years of abuse so I'd like to avoid this step if possible! Thanks for any help you can give!
i love your brand! i use it exclusively for my hair color and it never hurts my hair only makes it softer and stronger!
What does your Electric Banana coloring do to dark dark hair? I need to get a very big bird color type of hair.
I have quite dark brown hair (as seen in my profile picture) and I'm planning on dying my hair Vampire Red next week. I'm not allowed to use bleach, and I've never dyed my hair before, so I was wondering if you'd be able to give me an estimate of how well the dye will show up on my hair? Thank you. :)
Will your hair go back to its original color?
I've used a red and purple dye before, and they've only lasted a few days. Not sure what I'm doing wrong. It seems like manic panic dyes just don't last in my hair.

i dyed my hair with henna 3 months ago??will the manic panic hair dye stay on hair?
What are ways I can remove my haircolor (manic panic) from my white based hair? I have washed my hair with head and shoulders anti dandruff shampoo and dish soap with vitamin c but nothing is helping it come out of my hair. I can't bleach it out because I've bleached my hair too much and it's extremely dry. I used mystic heather and purple haze along with blue (idk what product name of yours) and it was an ombre which looked amazing and none of it was amplified but it is not coming out of my hair. I also went swimming and nothing is taking it out. It is a gross green color with gray and orange (even though I had no yellow tones in my hair before. I really want to get it back to white soon so I can do the color you did In this video all over my hair.
Hi! Idk if you'll see this but could you consider selling your products in India? I think there would be a pretty big and growing market here!
I have Voodoo Blue, because I wanna dye the tips of my hair.... ._.
I have medium to dark brown hair and I don't really want to bleach my hair so with brown hair will it still be vibrant but not as vibrant? ( if you could make a video that would be awesome! ) :)
hello! i have naturally black, asian hair. will the lighter dyes show up in my hair? for example, if i use virgin snow, will it end up dark/light brown? thank you :-)
My natural hair is about a 7 and I do not want to bleach it. I want to dye my hair pink - which colour(s) do you recommend that will show up well? Cotton Candy Pink?
I love Manic Panic's punk roots! I've always  felt like I was born in the wrong era and the late 70s/early 80s punk period has always been so fascinating to me! Tish and Snooky are so cool for starting that punk store in New York. I wish I could've been alive back then to witness it. And Mystic Heather is just about the most gorgeous color I've ever seen! I will definitely try it soon!
Cool
How do i make my hair color last longer??
I love the colours of your hair dyes! Some friends of mine have tried them and the results were just amazing!  I have wanted to dye my hair some crazy colour for a long time but my hir is medium brown and too thin to bleach. Is there any of your dyes that could dye my dark hair and turn out nice?Please tell me so!  Thank you very much!!
I've dyed my hair in the past but never an unnatural color so I'm only familiar with the brands of hair dye sold in stores. I can't believe it's taken me so long to look up brands of dye for the fun colors I really want. I intend to dye my hair mint green just in time for me to march in the local Pride parade where I live, coming up here in the middle of June. I can't wait to try the dye out, see if the color suits me, and what other's think of it on me....especially my friace...
How light do you need to bleach brown hair for hot tot pink to show up? Do any of your colors show up on unbleached hair?
I'm going to try mp now as bleach London was absolute rubbish, your colours are much cooler to, cant wait to try  😱 any pointers for mermaid greens & blues which ones?
i just love manic panic
f I have virgin hair will it be harder to see the color?
How well does Bad Boy Blue show on Black hair?
Can you use this dye without bleaching on deal hair extensions or do you suggest bleaching first because I would like use the after midnight & voodoo blue mix on my hair extensions
I don't prelighten my hair because I love how manic panic looks over my brown hair, it gives it a dark, nice sheen but it washes out the next wash! Is there a way I can make it last?
Is manic panic temporary hair die ?
I am dying my hair and I really like the blue color that she has on does anyone know what its calle
I love manic panic hair dye! I use a mix of conditioner and ultra violet, and a small dot of cotton candy pink to tone the yellow out of my blonde hair. i LOVE IT! and, it's vegan, that's amazing!
Been dying my hair for years with Splat, and have decided to go pastel with Manic Panic. I read about 500 articles recommending this over Splat for ANYTHING as well, so I guess I'm a new fan XD Though I might try using Virgin Snow as a color, I've never used toner before and I LOVE white hair. Might try Virgin Snow, then if I don't like it use Purple Haze, that way I don't lose either way.
Dos you hair have to be blond can it be black befor xx
What confuses me is that on the bottle it says not to apply on the scalp, but 1/2 inch away from it. In the video it looked like it was applied to the scalp lol. Other then that, I love the video and I love your products! :)
I'm really excited researching manic panic! I'm going to be using it for the first time this weekend to enhance my Henna'd hair's color :) Vampire red is such a pretty red color
Hey dudes! I was wondering what colour is in Snookie's hair?
This product is amazing! I would like to ask I am getting 2 colors and one of them is Candy floss I think it's called.. But I don't think it would show on my dark brown hair? Any advice on how I can make it show without bleaching my hair? And if not possible what colors would show on this hair colors? Thank you!!
I <3 Manic Panic! Thanks for making the only dye that sticks to my hair while not trashing my hair.
I have light brown/golden blonde hair, would I still get a vibrant colour without having to bleach it? since my hair is already lighter? Thanks :)
For dark hair, do I need to bleach in order to get color from the virgin snow? I don't necessarily need it to be white white. Grey coloring is fine with me. Just wanted to know if I needed to bleach to get any color.
What shampoo and conditioner do you recommend using? I've been using Herbal Essences Tea-Lightfully Clean out of pure habit, but I do see the color coming out with each wash, so clearly I need something different. =)
Do you need to bleach your hair before you use manic panic and do you need to use a cap?
The other product turned my hair different shades of red so I hope this works
I was told to use this product after my hair was messed up by a different brand
Hi! I have clearly no idea about anything hair color, I still have my virgin black hair and I want to rock a matte-ish pale brown color (or is it ash brown) but still showing the roots of my black hair, and I'd like to ombre it with a olive-green tea look in the middle and a blondish pastel light green on the tips. What materials should I use and prepare and Manic Panic colors to buy? What is the cream that you added on the video, and how do I do the whole process? ☺️ Any tips and tricks?
Hi! im planning to dye my bangs neon red which shade would you recommend my hair is about a level 9 blonde thanks!! :)

I wanna dye my hair blue, without using bleach. But I don't think it'll work because I have dark hair. Any tips?
Greetings from Germany..... I loooooooooove Manic Panic!!!!!!!!!!!
I'm currently dying my dark, natural, virgin hair with Wildfire. I didn't pre-lighten it because I want it to be an extra dark, deep shade of red. I heard that if you put Manic Panic in your conditioner, that helps to maintain it really well. Is that true?
Do you have to bleach your hair?
I'm planning on dyeing my hair purple but darkish purple what colors would be good for that.And I have already dyed my hair blonde and light brown
I've never dyed my hair before and my hair is dark brown and naturally curly so if I dye it purple haze will it show up and do I need to bleach it first?
I want blue black hair will mixing raven, midnight blue and shocking blue achieve this ?
ACTUALLY MY HAIR IS BETWEEN MOUSY BROWN AND MEDIUM
HI THERE MY BEAUTIES, I HAVE A QUESTION,MY HAIR IS BLEACHED BLONDE, WITH PASTEL PINK WICH I MADE FROM A BRAND THAT WAS WASH IN WASH OUT WITH CONDITIONER. IVE ONLY BLEACHED IT ONCE, AND ITS IN GOOD CONDITION, I CAN REMOVE ALOT OF THE COLOUR BY CLARYFYING, AND USING ANTIDANDRUFF SHAMPOO, AND IT GOES REALLY LIGHT BLONDE.  NOW MY ROOTS ARE MEDIUM BROWN AND COMING THRU, I DONT WANT TO CARRY ON BLEACHING ROOTS. I SAW THAT YOU SAY THAT HOT HOT PINK WILL BE OK FOR MEDIUM BROWN COVERAGE AND LIGHT BLONDE, IF I APPLIED THAT COLOUR ALL OVER WOULD IT BE EVEN COVERAGE,IVE BOUGHT A NEUTRAL PROTIEN FILLER BUT NOT SURE WHAT TO DO WITH IT.  SO BASICALLY CAN I GET EVEN COVERAGE EVEN THOUGH IVE TWO COLOURS, AND LIKE I SAY IM GROWING OUT MY ROOTS. HOW WOULD I APPLY? FROM ENDS FIRST TO ROOTS, OR OTHERWAY ROUND, OR SLAP IT ON. IF THE DYE HAS NO CHEMICALS IN IT , WHY DO YOU NEED TO TEST IT FISRT? I ALWAYS DO THE TESTS ANYHOW, BUT CHEMICAL DYES ARE NOW A PROBLEM FOR ME. IVE HAIR DOWN TO 4 INCHES PASSED MY SHOULDERS, WOULD I NEED 2 POTS? IVE GOT ONE TO TEST, REALLY INTERESTED, IF I CAN DO THIS, IT WOULD SAVE ME SO MUCH HASSELL,MY HAIR DOES HOLD COLOUR WELL, IN FACT WHEN I COLOUR IT , THE WATER ALWAYS RUNS CLEAR,AND LASTS A LONG TIME. COULD YOU PLEASE GIVE ME ANY INSIGHT AS IF I CAN COVER EVENLY?  IM A TRAINED HAIRDRESSER, BUT THINGS HAVE MOVED ON A BIT WITH COLOURS SO NEED YOUR EXPERTISE.   I JUST LOVE YOUR COLOURS, AND YOUR BRAND NAME, IVE TOLD A FEW FRIENDS AND THEY ARE NOW COLOURING THEIR HAIR, THANKYOU SORRY ITS LONG, HOPE TO HEAR FROM YOU SOON LOVE MELANIE IN THE UK XX

How long does manic panic stay in your hair? my school doesnt allow dyeing during the school year so I can only dye my hair during summer which is around 5 weeks. will manic panic come out before that?
my hair is mixed with blonde and ginger and I want to dye all of it with turquoise. my mom doesn't let me decolor my hair. will it look good without decolorizing?
Who filmed this for you guys? I would love to be able to film this type of video. Just need one more camera and some mics and it would've made a TON of a difference! (I go to school for this stuff) PS. Using ultra violet to dye my hair tonight woop!
Hi manic panic I loved the how to video! I have medium brown hair and I want to go black all over with your hair dye would I have to lighten my hair to achieve the black in it? I would prefer not to bleach and I love the idea  of using semi permanent dye that's also vegan let me know please! & thank you so much for being cruelty free I haven't dyed my hair in 4 years due to companies testing on animals I found out last year your company is cruelty free! That makes me beyond happy. If I could get a reply to my question that would be great so I know if I need to purchase your bleach kit as well
I used purple haze and voodoo blue on my bangs for a gradient look and it came out amazing. Manic panic is honestly the best. <3
I want to know what you're using to put in the dye, and where/how would I get it?
I'm thinking about bleaching and dip dyeing my hair this summer but I'm not sure because I have never dyed my hair (it's virgin). Also my hair is black and I was thinking of dyeing it turquoise or cotton candy pink but I'm not sure how it'll look. So I'd just like to know if the bleaching will damage my hair and if so how much? And help on what color I should do. (My eyes a dark brown if that helps) :)
Hey guys! So a few months ago, I dyed my natural medium blonde (virgin) hair with Vampire Red and it turned out GREAT.Although  It feels like I need a change now, so I've decided to change my hair colour to pastel blue.  I know I need to bleach my hair to light blond to get it blue, but how do I get there? Which bleach will give the best results on my red hair? (vol 30 or vol 40?) Do I need to dye it Virgin Snow after I've bleached it? Can I use pastelizer to blend the blue with or is better to use Virgin Snow? Do you have any extra tips? :) Thank you for all the answers!

Hi.  I have been wanting to dye my hair for a few months now just to try it.  I bought a tube of Vampire Red Styling Gel today.  The thing is, I have a buzzcut.  Is it safe to still do it?  Thanks.
A few questions: 1. I want to dye my hair a light purple. What purple shades do you have? 2. Will it work on my hair (my hair is very dark brown)? 3. Do I have to pre-lighten?  I would really like to know ASAP!
I have natural blond hair with lots of divrent shades and i really want it red and i really dont want too bleach it or anything att all, but wil the colour show ?? And after i want it too come off but will it stain ?? i prefer not using any products tough ...
I have a few questions. 1. I recently started dying my hair with your dyes (I have After Midnight and love it!), and I was wondering if you'd ever release your bleach powder in large tubs. I have naturally black hair and it grows very fast so I don't want my roots noticeable.   2. What color does Tish have in?  3. What color did Nicki Minaj have in the intro?   thank you :)
I did the vampire red 2 years ago. Cool!
Yeah, New York!
Hi! I would like to get some advice. I've bleached and dyed my hair before dark blue-ish color, and now it has faded to a dark brown cappucino color (I can't find other words to describe it), maybe a level 4/5. I want to get a dark grey color and I'm thinking of getting your new color, "Blue Steel". Should I try using it directly on my hair now without bleaching it again? Because I'm not trying to achieve the light grey color of Blue Steel, but I want the shade to be a darker version of Blue Steel (if you know what I mean). Or do you have any other advice, maybe mixing colors? Thanks! FYI: I'm Asian & I think my hair is the stubborn type :/
I dyde my hair blue with a strong long lasting colour and my hair broke apart with split ends everywhere and then I started using manic panic and dyde my hair half blue half green and it actually made my hair softer and less damage, thank you for making this product.

I really wanna dye my hair purple. But like a dark purple. What is the darkest my hair can be for the dye to work?
Also another round of questions lol: I dip dyed my hair pink with splat an Im pretty sure I stained my hair, do you know of any ways to remove it? I bleached my hair with the splat brands bleach 2 months ago, would bleaching it with another brand kill my hair/ make the wnds fall off? D: Also do you guys have a bleaching dye thing?
On you (the people applying it) do you use manic panic on your hair? If yes the  what shade of pink did the one on the right have? I really like it lol. Also do you guys have like a very very very vibrant neon hot pink color? I like pink :)
I'm actually using wildfire so idk if it will show
I used the flash lighting 40 volume bleach kit. Left it on for an hour, and it was orange. I tried toning it, still orange. I'm really sad. Now my hair looks ugly and ratchet. :(
And i don't want to harm my hair with bleach or anything like that so is that possible and how ?!  Thanks
I have black hair and im a girl (13) do you think its ok if i buy manic panic and what colour ?!

Hi :) Can I use Manic Panic to refresh my color? What color would you recommend? My hair is currently an Ariel red hair color with a hint of pink/magenta.
Is it possible to get it out after having it in for a week?
Does manic panic stain naturally blond hair? I have very blond hair and I really want to use this product but I don't want to bleach it! My hair is like a butterscotch blond. :)
I was thinking about mixing vampire red and purple haze. Would that look good or would it mix oddly? Also, I have really thick, wavy hair that goes to about mid chest. Would two bottles of color be enough?
So,average hair dye stays in about a month?
I'm a 19 year old guy who's never dyed his hair before....doing it for the first time tomorrow.... Thank you so much for this vid! Wish me luck!! ...Btw I'm doing lilac :)

I have dark blonde/ash blonde hair and i want to dye it blue, do i need to bleach it before?:)
I've been using manic panic for years and I love tish and snooky!
Do I have to mix the colour with conditioner?
Good for you getting your business going ladies! However, though i love the color of the purple manic panic...it didnt last 4-6 weeks. It doesn't even last a week!  I was disappointed.
I use manic panic, it's not that difficult to make hair looks cool with it.
Does it colour ur bed? Or car seats? I mean like when were done dying out hair and i lay on my bed does it show any colour?
I would like to use your dyes... Like orange :) !
Tisha and Snookie seem so fun. <3
if i keep my dark brown hair natural and use vampire red on my hair and keep it for over 10 hours will it dye better? also, can i re-dye to strengthen the color?
Will the hair dye wash out completely so by four to six weeks will I be able to return to my original hair color?
Hi there.... right now i have a bright magenta color from loreal... hi color magenta and I'm not really feeling it like I use to and I want to go to a purple violet or maybe still with a tinge of red in there. Could I use a manic panic color to do this without beaching it.
I have a quick question. My hair is sort of a "Sunkissed Brown" or so I have been told, and I was wondering if I would have to bleach my hair to be able to get a good outcome of dying my hair with Manic Panic.
Where can I buy?
woah.. i didn't expect tish and snooky to be.. that age. no offense, i just thought they'd be younger
Ok, so I really want to do a winter blue color in my hair, what color in your brand would achieve it the color I want the most? I'm a newbie to this, hehe.
Hi! I want to dye it blue with purple which 2 colours do you recommend? I got light brown hair but i can't bleached it :C Bc my parents let me.
I already have purple hair myself but my roots are coming in bad, should I bleach it or should I just re-dye it using the same purple. Or, I wanted to use the manic panic instead of the splat so what color do you think would be moist like their new purple desire?
They are so cute
I have green eyes and fairly light skin, what colour would suit me best?
My nana is from nyc and I'd just love to meet you gals, awesome store back in the day! I wish i coulda grown up going to stores like that!
How does Manic Panic amplified work though?
How long does this stay in?
I want to mix hot hot pink and shocking blue to make a purplish tone, but I don't want to bleach my hair. If I want it to be a darker purple, Would it be OK if I don't bleach it at all (My hair is reddish brown atm) ?? And would the colour stay in my hair the same average period of time? And what shampoo and conditioner would you recommend?
Amazing!!!
I've fallen in love with y'alls products. I love that everything is vegan. Its nice not having to check to see if something is vegan.

I've just ordered your moon blue shad of dye, hoping to achieve the same effect as the sample pics on your website of the person who has fauxhawk styled hair. I was wondering, about how long the dye was left in their hair?
I'm about a level 6-7 and I want to dye it Purple Haze. Will that be okay? & do you have to add conditioner?

My hair is a dark brown , & I want to dip dye it hot pink . Just about 2 or 3 inches .. When I purchase the hair dye , does the kit come with bleaching powder or do I have to buy it separately ? Are manic panic hair dyes sold at Sally's beauty supply ? & for how long do I have to leave the bleach on if I don't want a neon pink , but a bright pink ? :)
How well would Rockabilly Blue show up on unbleached, dark blonde-brownish hair?
WHAT ABOUT ON GREY HAIR TO ADD BLONDE SHADES
By far the best brand of dye out there. I will always use it!
I tried cotton candy pink on platinum hair and it did not take it looks like a pink  hue do u know any method I can do to make it look the same way that it looks on the swatch.
I have a question, I want to dye my hair the tiger lily colour and my hair is already a orange colour, I think it's a 7.40 in colour, would I have to bleach it? I really don't want to bleach my hair, I just want my hair to come out heaps orange
I'm a natural blonde and dyed my hair black, but it washed out. It was chemically dyed, and my friend said it'd be fine if I washed it in warm/hot water, because that's what she did. But it doesn't work for me. You're right, everyone's hair is different. cx When I re-dye my hair black, I'm doing it teal/turquoise. Which shade of your product do you recommend? c:
hi i already dyed my hair green and i wanted to know if i can just go over it with voodoo blue or should i re-bleach?
You guys are so adorable and are such an inspiration!
haha   manic panic dont work for me
My hair was bleached about 2-3 weeks ago and the dye has already faded because I went into a pool with chlorine in it stupidly...but I was wondering if the bleach already in my hair will help it last longer when I put the Manic Panic in my hair?
I'm so nervous! About to dye my hair using this product!
I love Manic Panic. Best hair dye in the world
What light do i have to make it to get it dark blue someone said light brown but i don't know can you help me?
I have used Manic Panic since I was 15 I'm 22 now and I still love it! I'm really in to the whole pastel color trend and I'd love to have lavender hair! Which purple Manic Panic dye do you think would achieve the best lavender result  when mixed with condition?
Hello I had bought the manic panic the one in the cylinder little bowl. Do I have to use volumiser. Or can I put it in my hair like that.
Do you have a salon?
somewhere I read that after rinsing in cold water, if you rinse or spray with vinegar and water it will set the color better and for longer....is this true?
IM not allergic to any hairdyes (From what I used, Crazy colour and box hairdye from the store), is it still reccomended to do a test?
I've been using Manic Panic for about 2 & 1/2  years now & I just love it! I currently have most of my hair black but my bangs are Atomic Turquoise, & a mixture I made that looks similar to Electric Lizard, & I just love it! My all time favorite is Voodoo Blue, I have that color in my hair in my picture actually :p Thanks for making an awesome dye :D
I used splat hair dye on my whole head and it's purple. It's been in for a month and I want to dye my hair again. I want half green half blue. I'm going to use manic panic. But, I'm not sure how it would look on faded purple and it's lighter in some spots it's dark in spots ect. I really need help. My hair is dead already(I bleached it) and I don't wanna bleach it again. Help?
If we don't see the exact color we want to purchase is it ok to mix two different colors?
How long would you recommend to keep the virgin snow in? I know longer than 30min but what would you say?
Will using a hair straightener do anything to my hair after I have dyed it? Like is it bad for it?
I was wondering how often it was okay to dye with manic panic. I like to change up my colors frequently and manic panic always leaves my hair super soft and seemingly undamaged. :3 That being said, I don't know when is over doing it when it comes to dying it.

I've just bought Vampire Red and will be putting it on soon. I will be going swimming a couple of times a month from September. Is it likely the colour will run into the pool leaving a red trail in the water? I hate wearing swimhats so would prefer to avoid, but if the colour runs I can't do that in a public pool.

hey, I was planning to dye my hair green with enchanted forest. I have naturally dark brown hair, the same length as of your model and quite thin. I wanted it to come out as a very dark shade, not so vibrant so that it would blend in nicely with my natural shade. I know maybe I shouldn't bleach first? do you have some other tips? Also I want to color my hair randomly, wouldn't it be difficult to comb them that way? Or if I comb less or not at all, the shade would be darker?
I got 2 questions, my skin tone is an olive tan color and I have natural black hair, what color would be flattering? And if I want to change colors would I need to bleach my hair each time?
I want to dye my hair lavender. Which color in manic panic would be a lavender????? And how long will it stay in my hair
Ultraviolet is my ideal color, and I have used it and LOVED it.........for like a week. Even the amplified formula just refuses to hold on to my hair :/ I don't even shampoo it, and it disappears. I walked to work twice during one week and the color was nearly gone by the end of the week. Any tips on keeping that color for longer periods of time? If I didn't have waist long hair, I'd definitely be recoloring my hair with Ultraviolet every week. Unfortunately, I can't afford to spend $30 a week on hair color >.< But it's such a perfect, pretty color :'c
I have brown hair, and want dye a strip purple, will that work?
Is there any color you guys would suggest for honey blonde hair that would come out kinda bright?
Love the Hair Dye! been using it for several years now and its a show stopper! I'm one of those who sleep in the color haha

Do you condition afterwards or do you just rinse?
\can you use this without bleaching your hair first?
I have dark brown, almost black hair. Would I need to bleach my hair before I could get any of the colors to show up?
if you guys could answer it'd be great I have natural virgin hair so it's a dark brown, I wanna dye it with a mixture of vampire red and pretty flamingo, now I don't want it to be extremely vibrate just noticeably red so my question is do I still have to bleach my hair a couple shades up or will those two colors show on it's own ?
I used atomic tourqouise and now schools coming back and i need to take it out. So what is the fastest ways to get it out?

hi as you can see my hair in my picture I have dirty blonde hair color and I am wanting to dye my hair the turquoise by manic panic but I don't know if I don't like it will I get my normal hair color back. when I dye it I want it to look like a lot of peoples on YouTube that say manic panic turquoise. do you have any opinions on what color it might turn out as or if it can effect my normal hair color. and where to buy this product thanks
Coloring my hair red with this I'm so happy my moms letting me
I'm sat with your 40 volume bleach in right now with just a few minutes left and then it's to rinse it and add Virgin Snow :3 On Sunday I am getting a rainbow mohawk :D Cadillac pink in the front and then Hellfire red, Sunshine yellow, Rockabilly blue, mixing between the layers, and on the short sides I'm having Atomic turquoise.. Been a long time since I dyed my hair now(two years!) so it's about time something wild happened :D I'm off to rinse! Wish me luck :3
If you want a bright color you will have to bleach it to a pale yellow color
Hi I have dark brown hair and I have a problem with bleaching I wouldnt want to use it in my hair what colors do you recommend for me to use?

Has some ingredient changed in ur bleach kit? Last two times I tried it I broke out in hives the reaction was very serious  I had just assumed it was caused by something else the first time since I've used it a couple times before. I'm afraid to bleach my hair again now

I love manic panic! The colors are great, it wont hurt your hair...and its vegan!!! I cant wait for my next dye!
This is my first time dying my hair and I really want to try out the After Midnight Blue dye, I hv black hair and I want a really vibrant intense blue shade, should I bleach my hair beforehand and if I should, then how light?  I want it to end up a shade of blue thts very obvious, not a blue-black but a very intense dark-ish blue, do you think After Midnight Blue would give me that colour or would a different blue give me this?
I have a question also...  Ok, so I have been wanting to dye my hair for so long and now I'm gonna do it using manic panic, but since my hair is a dark dirty blonde I have to bleach it first.  But I'm very scared because my hair is naturally very thin and I don't want it to get worse.  What should I do?
I have natural red hair is there any colors that would work on me if i don't bleach?
Which has more dye: amplified or high voltage? The jars look like they hold more than the bottles! I want to make sure I get enough to dye all my hair. :-)

Hi I have natural brown hair (a level 4), but 5 months ago I died it a darker brown, like a level 3. and my roots have grown way out, about 2 inches. And I don't quite want to bleach my hair, but I want my hair a deep red, kind of like a red velvet cake color. What would be the best color of yours to use and will the color take well? Should I lighten it a bit?
whats the difference bettween ampliffied dye and the one which comes in the jar? also in how long will a colour like enchanted forest will last about on ginger hair which i wash every 4-5 days?
I love manic panic Now! I bought a tub of atomic turquoise and put a big streak at the front of my hair (behind my fringe) and it's turned out super pretty! I have quite dark brown hair but I put lemon juice on it and sat out in the sun all day. It turned a nice light blonde. If you can't bleach your hair you should try that instead!!!

Hello,Ive been dying my hair red for two years but it was a different brand now I wanna try manic panic,but for summer holiday I want to make the lower parts green too,can I use the hair gel ,the one whih washes off on first shower,without bleaching,will my  dyed red hair turn green  with it ? Or do ı have to buy classic green hair dye and bleach it again
Hey Manic Panic, I was wondering. I'm using the atomic turquoise, and since I had my hair bleached to a golden color, it went green-ish (a nice sea foam green shade, i love it). I was thinking if it would a good idea to use virgin snow and then after rinsing and drying it out, put on the atomic turquoise so I could have that perfect turquoise color.
Did you guys mix anything into the dye while you were dyeing her hair??
currently a voodoo blue gal! :D
I have black hair and I wanted to dye it with purple haze and get it dark not to vibrant if I were to bleach my hair would it be too bright
I have dirty blonde hair do I have to bleach to put in pink and purple ombre
I love manic panic, but i didn't have a great experience  with it xc. I dyed my hair using the voodoo blue, but i put it over my light brown hair. After once wash it faded to a bright turquoise, then faded to a bright green and then to a grey and it never came out. I dyed it in April 2013 and it wouldn't come out of my hair until August 2013 after i got it bleached. I love manic panic, it's so vibrant, but I don't know why it did that to my hair.
Can we buy it from internet?

Im a brunette and never had hair dye but now that im older, I can use it. if I wanted an electric blue, do you think it would show in my dark brunette hair? what colors would stand out in your opinion? :) thanks.

My parents are dead set on not letting me dye my hair, so can I easily dye a small hidden streak?
I had dyed my hair multiple times and now it is settled to light-ish brown. I want to dip dyed my hair with the Amplified Pink Cadillac color. I'm scared if i bleach it, it will become orange and then when I wash the dye out it'll be a different color. Because if the pink goes wrong then i can't do anything else. i already bought the dye but I haven't buy the bleach yet. i'm just scared because i'm having my summer holiday now for 2 months. I'm scared that when i bleach my hair it will turn a disgusting orange and a different pink.. :( will the color after the bleaching process affects the color?
I lightened my normally dark-brown hair to an all over blond, though it wasn't the same color everywhere. I've been using Purple Haze but it fades after just a WEEK, even if I only wash my hair once or twice in that week. I'm switching back to Ultra Violet (like in my pic) but is there a reason Purple Haze is fading so fast? My hair is light brown by the end of the week and it sucks!
Does the dye burn? Also I have really curly hair, will it change that? Also can i put this on my hair if I decided to relax it straight? thanks

Podrian traer a uruguay!?  Yo soy mucho de cambiarme el color de pelo pero aca no ahi mucha variedad de colores fantasia y me gustaria probar colores nuevos!
My hair is currently an orange-ish blonde (colored it multiple times with box blonde dyes), and I'm trying to get it to be a blue color. If I were to color it with a Manic Panic blue color, would the orange tones mess around with the overall color (say it would turn my hair purple instead)?
I am wanting to dye my hair red but I have never dyed my hair before. I still have my natural color so what I was wondering is after manic panic fades will it still be my natural color? I am a natural dirty blonde. And I do not plan on bleaching it.
I used Manic Panic hair dye a month ago for the first time and I loved the results. I've use the Amplified Green Envy and it does look great on me.
