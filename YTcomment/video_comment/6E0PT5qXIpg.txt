October 21st 2025
I know this is an old video. But i have made this cookie. They turned out well. Im making it for the 3rd time today. But i have a problem.. why does it spread? Burns too? Sometimes a bit too flat. And sticks to the parchment paper.. please help
Where can I find the measurements?
sugar measurement plz
Thank you for the amazing  recipe, Gemma.I have tried out so many other cookie recipes and it has always been a flop.This time I not just followed your recipe but also the additional tips that you mentioned and it made wonders.This time my cookie came out so well just as expected!❤. But I have a concern.My chocolate doesn't melt at all.This imhas always been the concern.I chopped my chocolate chunks and it doesn't melt.Be it couverture chocolate or compound.Why is that and what should I do?.
Can I make these cookies in an air fryer?
Hi gemma...I made cookies according to this recipe...they turned out awesome but......I made only one batch of cookies..they r a little salty, than they should actually b...so is there anything I can do or mix anything in the rest of the batter..to make less salty cookies...pls answer my question
Hi and thanks for sharing your recipe 😊👍🙏
She is awesome thanks u for easy recipes ❤
How much of each ingredient should be added isn’t clearly mentioned, that rattles me out, can anyone help me out here?
I can’t find measure of each ingredients at all even on website. Can someone help?
Hey Gemma!! Love this recipe. How can I adapt it to make it a big chewy cookie cake? Do I need to change anything to make a soft chewy cookie cake? Add an extra egg?
As with everything you make, these are amazing!!  I made a batch for my grandchildren, and they couldn’t get enough of them! 😊 What would you think about using browned butter?
You’re the best! There is NO ONE I trust to a fantastic baking recipe lol ❤
Hi Gemma. I have been using this recipe for 5 years now and I noticed that it dries up after 2 days so what I do is I put a piece of bread in my cookie jar (it is airtight) so it will not dry out..But now that I will be selling these, what should I do to avoid drying out? Thanks in advance..
Where can i find the ingredient amounts?
Made these several times and they are always incredible. Gemma is the best! ❤
You need to go somewhere to find the recipe🙄🙄
It's so tempting but I am not able to find out the measurements how much should I use
Hi Gemma! Can I also use a mixer?
Hi Gemma, these cookies are amazing. How long can they be stored for?
Someone help me. I made this recipe. Since I only wanted half the batch, I did divided all the ingredients in half. But unfortunately the cookie spread too thin. It was very very flat. I followed all the instructions. I chilled the dough for an hour. I followed the temperature and time on the oven as given in the recipe. Used the right ingredients. But why did it happen this way?  The original recipe called for these ingredients   	•	354 g all-purpose flour 	•	1 ½ teaspoons salt 	•	1 teaspoon baking soda 	•	225 g butter, melted 	•	212 g dark brown sugar 	•	170 g granulated sugar 	•	2 large eggs 	•	2 teaspoons vanilla extract 	•	340 g bittersweet chocolate bar  I wanted to make only half of those cookies so I halved the recipe like so:  177 g all-purpose flour 3/4 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 112.5 g butter, melted 106 g dark brown sugar 85 g granulated sugar 1 large egg 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 170 g bittersweet chocolate bar  Where do you think I went wrong ??  Please note that I’ve already made this recipe so many times before and it came out soooo good. And not too flat and it was thick and gooey in the centre just like how Gemma described. But those times I used the amount/weight of ingredients in the original recipe. This is the first time I’m halving the recipe. I dunno if I messed up any reaction cos of it.
Chocolate chip has always been my favourite  Thank you for the cookie recipe and video
Hi if i will make this for 30grms what is temp and baking time? Thank you❤
Hi Gemma, to replace the egg would it be better to use yogurt or flax egg in this recipe?
Still making these. Turn out perfect every time. It's my go to recipe for cookies. Thankyou Gemma!!
Thank you for your recipes explained step wise so nicely. Next step will be making a cake.
Please do not skip the brown sugar or vanilla. I can’t even believe that was said.
Watch out for the written recipe.. it says cook them for 14 to 16 minutes which will burn them. Just do 12 minutes like Gemma says in the video. Fantastic cookies though.
this is my second time attempting to make these and the dough looks nowhere near yours Idk if I'm making a mistake or whatever but just to be sure because you don't elaborate when you say 1 cup of butter melted do you measure it with measuring cups or a measuring cup? Also do you measure it accordingly when it's non melted or after you've melted it and it's measures exactly one cup?
Just ate one of these cookies, Gemma said they were big ,she was right she also said they were easy to make, she was right again. She made a bigger and bolder statement saying they were the best ever, which I can’t deny. They are the best , next time I’m going to age the dough. Thank you so much for sharing this incredible cookie
When we put it in the fridge before baking do we wrap the bowl with seram wrap or foil or just leave as is?
after you melt the butter do you have to wait for it to cool? Or use it immediately
The ultimate gourmet meal.
hi gemma, Can the recipe be turn into other flavors? like matcha cookies or any other flavors and if it can, how can i do it? thank you
How do you age them? In fridge or does it count in freezer? Thanks Im a bit obsessed with your videos now😅
Came out perfectly Thank u !
Hey Gemma do you think it matters if I use bleached or unbleached flour? Also do you have a favorite brand you use for cookies?
Hello I mad cookies today ur recipe. But I have a gas oven my cookies are not flattening but turning bulky they r not spreading any solution for that is that an issue of the oven or something else ??
i followed this recepie .. and tried to my lovely crunchy cookies same like yours ..  but it was a cake not cookies 😢
Ive made these a 100 times never get tired of them, this is the only cookie recipe i trust and love, thanks gemma!
where are the measurements?
Hi Gemma! I've been using this recipe for 2 years now, my parents think it's too sweet for them since they're cutting sugar on their diet and I tried to reduce the white sugar all in, but I have problem with the texture (hardened sometimes) how do I fix this?
Love you gemma watching yiu since 19
What is the difference between using melted butter , brown melted butter , soften butter ?
My 7 yrs son's favorite chocolate chip cookies..he is very picky eater..i give these cookies in his lunch box and he loved it
Question? Do you have any diabetic friendly dessert recipes? Especially with monk fruit as a sweetener?
Why do we have to go somewhere else to get your recipes??😏
Hello Gemma! It’s been so long! So I was just wondering, I’m making some cookies. So I know that 3/4 cups of butter is 170 grams, but my recipe says it’s 110; which is 1/2 a cup. So which should I follow because I’m very confused.
Dear Gemma, plz do tell me how to bake them in microwave
Hi do you have to wait for the butter to cool before mixing in with the sugar ?
sweet, i have to try one
👍
Hi Gemma! I made these cookies for Christmas 2 years back (i was 13 at the time) and it instantly turned into a family hit :) Now they're forcing me to make these again 2 years later so I had to chose this recipe again! THANK YOU for this absolutely heavenly cookie recipe
I hate when they make us hunt for measurements.
Thanks Gemma. I first made these cookies in 2018 at my previous workplace. It had rave reviews and people kept asking me to bring more. I’ve since moved 3 countries and of course years have passed,and I still find myself coming back to this recipe (including today, as I am trying out a new oven!) because as you’ve rightfully said they are the best ever!! Thank you so much.
Hi Gemma, in case you see this I want to say a huge thank you to you! I tried your best ever brownies and everyone simply fell in love with them. I have so much confidence in your recipes because they turn out fabulous and it has definitely improved my baking ten fold!
Hi Ma'am...I made these cookies. it came out well. sweetness is perfect. thank you.  May I.know the shelf life of these chocolate chips cookies,  at room temperature?
Hi Ma'am...if I make.the cookie size.small, then the baking time will differ?
I made this recipe just now again. But this time i substituted butter for olive oil, sugar for erithritol (sweetener that tastes almost exactly like sugar but with 0 calories) and Oat flour for white flour 👍👍👍It became an amazing beautiful tasty cookies and extremely healthy 💕💕💕💕
❤🧑‍🍳
Can I really keep the dough for 5-7 days? On other websites I read that the maximum is 4 days...
Ingredients correct quantity please?
Kept going back to this video whenever I am about to bake chocolate chip cookies. It's been my guide for years now.❤️🥰🇵🇭Thanks so much Gemma for all your videos.🥰
If you love vanilla  extract you should try the vanilla from Mexico. You will never try a better one.
♥️
Can anyone tell me why my cookie dough is really sticky? In all the videos I see the freshly made dough never looks sticky. I've tried refrigerating the dough for 20mins before scooping into balls, but every batch I make has sticky dough.
Can you please tell me if i can make these cookies in something else cus my oven is not working and i always make cakes in a large tight pan
You cook nice ❤️
Trying English subtitles please but I don't listen so I am deaf
I JUST TRIED THIS RECIPE!! amazing!! Thank you so much! Ive been trying to make cookies but it fails every time. This is easy and amazing! Can i use gluten free flour?
Where is d exact measurement plsss
Gemma also on the written recipe it’s 14-15 minutes so I should go with 12 min and if smaller size it’s 11 min
Hi Gemma where should I place the tray in the middle rack or any rack is fine?
worked perfectly
Hi Gemma. I'm Margaret from Bangalore, India.  Tried this recipe with your very precise instructions. They came out perfectly well! Important tips of substituting chocochips with dark chocolate chunks and chilling the dough for some hours really did the magic.  Thank you so very much!
Hi Gemma happy new year! I just wanted to ask you on your website you said a couple of different things then in your video and I just got a bit confused on which one was right?
Just made these and they were incredible! Exactly as pictured and described, thank you Gemma! Question about swapping the flour for a gluten free option? Would you know any way to make this recipe using a gluten free flour (cassava, tigernut, almond flour)?  I've been following your channel for a few years and each recipe I've tried has worked out perfectly, but now I'm finding my body doesn't tolerate gluten, so hoping to be able to use your recipes with some swaps. Thank you and may 2023 bring you abundant joy.
Yummy 😋😋
Worst recipe ever, not worth the try
These really are THE BEST chocolate chip cookies! I won a cookie contest with it a couple of years ago and I am making them for my church Christmas Cookie Exchange tomorrow night! They will love it! Thank you for sharing your “best” baking recipes with us!
Thank you soooooo much for this recipe,  I couldn't believe that I baked these cookies, they spread out well and tasted so much like Ben's cookies  Truly this was the best chocolate chip cookie recipe ♥️
Hi if you make the cookie smaller how long do you bake it for thanks
hi i want to make small 1 tbsp cookies. wen i did i saw a little spread is it because i have kept in the middle rack?
I cannot wait to try these! They look amazing. If I wanted smaller cookies, does this change the bake time? Like say I wanted half this size cookies?
If we make the dough couple of days in advance, do we need to store in the refrigerator? And how long is the dough good for?
i share this recipe with literally anyone who even just mentions making cookies🤣
Speaking of the cookbook you have a slightly different recipe for chocolate chip cookies in the cook book. I haven't tried that one yet cause these ones are a hit. Do you prefer the cookbook ones?
I crush it every year around the holidays with these cookies ! I had to buy your cookbook to show support 💖
I tried these this evening; the melted butter, bicarbonate of soda and chopped chocolate really are a game changer. Best cookies I've made in years - even if I do say so myself 😉
Gemma you are a great cook . Few years ago I tried your carrot cake recipe and it came perfect . All I needed to do if I make it other time I choose to put less icing sugar in the cream cheese.  Other than that the cake was just perfect. Thankyou for your hard work and dedication to detail. Your internet site its very helpful and with good knowledge.  Sincere regards all the way from Malta 🇲🇹 Europe.
I've made a lot of different chocolate chip cookies in the last 20 years of my life and these are absolutely divine. I used 72% Ghirardelli chocolate. Perfection. I can't wait to try the brownie recipe next!
Thank you Gemma, I ve made these chocolate chip cookies 🍪 few times already and I must say it's really the best chocolate chip 🍪.
I tried today bt cookie crust was nt crispy
I love this cookies and I ve been watching few of your videos  Can I reduced the amount of brown sugar like 3/4cup instead of 1 1/4.i don't like if it's too sweet,
If we were to double the recipe would you recommend doubling the sugars too?Im afraid the cookies might come out too sweet then
I actually have 2 Chocolate Chip Cookie Recipes from Great Aunts
Nice
which chocolate u used ?
I made them too. It was so perfect. Everyone loved them.
Hi gemma, should we mix warm melted butter to sugar or room temp melted butter
I make double portion of these with toasted walnuts as a portion of the chocolate, freeze, then sprinkle Maldon salt on top before going in oven.  $0.50 a cookie with chocolate chips instead of chopped chocolate.  I love these cookies, I will make them forever.
Just made these today and they are best cookies I have ever made!!! Been looking for a long time for a bakers cookie and this is it!!! Thank You!
Im gonna try this recipe cuz of all the desserts I bake I haven't found a good chocolate chip cookie recipe.
Thanks gemma
I made those when my parents were together and my siblings loved them a lot,never getting old
Hey Gemma! This recipe is very good but in your cookbook, it's different than this?
I put the dough in the freezer for 5 days and the cookies still spread out :/. It was surprising because the dough was pretty hard to scoop it.
i love watching your videos, they give me that relax feeling that i never get bored or want them to go fasterthe bad thing is that they always make me hungry (and that i dont have your excellence at cooking
“Bigger Bolder Baking Best Banana Bread” I live for the alliteration.
At Gemma, you are right! These are the best ever chocolate chip cookies!!!  Made these yesterday for my sons lunch boxes and OMG, absolutely amazing!
Hi!  Could u recommend me which one is better gas or electric oven in cookingRange
Did anyone else find it v hard to scoop out after putting in fridge , I find making balls and then putting in fridge to chills was much easier
Hi Gemma did u really add 1 and 1/2 tsp salt ( as per recipe on the website) I added less and my cookies were still salty but otherwise v good
Did you use all purpose flour or bread flour?
I meant in the fridge do you put it in the coldest part or the normal part
Do you put it in the coldest part or the normal part?
Man these rlly are best ever cookies ! For the first batch I refrigerated according to your instructions and they turned out AMAZING ! Unfortunately for the second batch I refrigerated for around 3-4 days and defrosted for 30 min but when baking they didn’t spread much :( what should I do to make the second cookie batch spread as much as the first one ?
I have a question after melting the butter do you have to wait till the butter cools down?
I followed the recipe EXACTLY.  But my dough was runny. Anyone else have this problem??  Also.. It didn't say to pack the Brown sugar, and I know recipes typically call for that .. so I didn't pack it tight but I packed it slightly. Not sure if that made a difference. Also it looks like she's using dark Brown sugar but the recipe calls for light Brown sugar not sure if that makes a difference either. These look good but I found this kind of frustrating
Made these with my grandson they were fantastic, my daughter couldn't stop eating them. I've made a few things following your videos and have just bought your book .  You remind me of my old mum back in Lancashire Northern England, you speak the same language in cooking terms and cooking utensils , Keep it going love your channel :)
Can I brown the melted butter and use it in this recipe?
Absolutely delectable looking cookie 🍪 wow.  How man ounces (or grams) are your cookies?  I make 2 ounce balls and that size seems perfect.  Yes I weigh each one for consistency.
Any eggless cookies recepy mam pls share link
Hello ma’am.  After i bake the cookies they harden after cooling ?  How can i prevent that so that they remain gooey?  Will reheating help? Or am i doing something wrong?
Beautiful cooking tutorial.
Why you never mention measurement one time. As you call them out just mention it makes things easier
She has 2 receipts one with oil one without which one is better. I made the one with oil tasty but they got to big
Will it be sweet??
Its been years since I’ve started following you, every time I want to eat 🍪 I always come here, they are so delicious!
Hi, what do you think about adding green food coloring to the dough for the holidays?  If so, what stage would you add it? I thought about adding red and green m&ms instead, but I don’t want to sacrifice the chocolate chunks, and I don’t want to add any extra sweetness to an already very sweet treat
Can i use dark brown sugar instead of light brown?
Hi, I'm not sure if you can help me or not, but no matter what chocolate chip cookie recipe I bake they never come out brown and golden.  Now, I'm not sure if it's because I use Splenda Blend instead of sugar, but it's driving me crazy.  If you have any suggestions, I'd really appreciate it.  Thank you:)
May I ask for the heat that you use upper & lower heat with fan or just fan?  thank you Gemma.   watch your recipe everyday   from your fan in Thailand😘😘😘
I made this, and oh my god, I haven’t  had luck with chocolate chip cookies in the past but this was the best ones I’ve ever eaten or made, EVERYONE SHOULD TRY THIS
Hello, Gemma! From where can I find the egg substitutes? I'm a vegetarian so.  Btw, love from India ☺️❤️
Where is the recipe for these cookies gemma 😍😍
I have made so many choco chip cookies during the lockdown , each time trying out a different recipe  from youtube and i need to tell you that your cookies have been the best tasting out of all , DELICIOUSSSSS❤️
How do these differ from your other choc chip cookies? The best on the internet one's...
I made a batch of this, I've put half into the freezer, and I made the rest, they aren't spreading out....what do I do?? Is there anything that can be done to fix the other half of the dough??
I made them, I refrigerated them for three days. The result dry powdered cookies unable to swallow 😭  what did I do wrong?
Why you don’t give the measurements for the ingredients
Should we only melt cold butter? Or can we melt the room temp butter too?
may I know the exact amount of each ingredients?
I made these yesterday for my grandson who is in college.  I just put them in the mail today.  They are delicious!  The only change I had to make was the chocolate:  I used semi-sweet chocolate chips because they were what I had on hand.  Thank you.
How can I reduce the sugar in this recipe? I have made this multiple times but the sugar is too much
I made these today and they turned out very bad :((   They were very very hard and at 10 min they were not cooked, these were completely pale and not very pretty… I made them first with the 1/4 measurement and they turned out HUGE, they mixed up with each other… They I corrected the temperature, the time and the size and they actually ended up looking and tasting like cookies, but I wasted a lot of dough and I feel really sad about it. My recommendations is to make just 2 or 3 cookies, see if the temperature and the time is fine and then do the others.  Your recipe works, and the cookies are good, I think I just followed the instructions wrong ;-;
But why you dont give the measurements!!!
Hi Gemma and many others  I would tell you that u can use jaggery  instead  of brown sugar it always works for me the cookies and brownies always turn out fudgy, so if u run out of brown sugar or u live in a place where they don't  sell brown sugar u can always use jaggery 😀😃❤
i am just 13 and made these on my own , Thanks for the recipe
Hi Gemma, would just like to know whether the top heating element of the oven has also to be turned on with the bottom one. Also on which rack of the oven should I place my tray..?
I made the cookies and it's delicious. The only thing scooping 100 g into the baking sheet as per the recipe is way too much. Half is being enough.
hello in your recepis no oilve oil n b powder listed but in your video you mentioned it
What is the ratio of flour, sugar and baking pow?
I'm 12 and I made these cookies . I put my batch of cookies in to the fridge  for like 3 hours before i baked them . They were super delicious . But instead of melted butter I used brown butter . That brown butter gave my cookies a great nutty flavour .
I tried them and like all of your recipes the cookies turned out really well!  However, I just wanted to ask whether there was a specific reason why mine turned out flat. Did I do something wrong?
I made your cookies but I made a giant cookie I was in heaven
I want to try this, but can you give me idea or exact measurements for each ingredients 🥺🙏 Thank you much!!
Can you please specify the measurements to make it more easier
My cookies turned out very flat... I even put it in the fridge for 1 day, and made ball shape... I pre heated the oven, the recipe didnt really say preheat oven, I just assumed that I should. When it mentioms a tea spoon, is it flattened tea spoon? Maybe I added too much baking soda?
T̆̈h̆̈ĕ̈s̆̈ĕ̈ ă̈r̆̈ĕ̈ s̆̈ŏ̈ t̆̈ă̈s̆̈t̆̈y̆̈ ă̈n̆̈d̆̈ j̆̈ŭ̈s̆̈t̆̈ t̆̈h̆̈ĕ̈ r̆̈ĭ̈ğ̈h̆̈t̆̈ ă̈m̆̈ŏ̈ŭ̈n̆̈t̆̈ ŏ̈f̆̈ ĕ̈v̆̈ĕ̈r̆̈y̆̈t̆̈h̆̈ĭ̈n̆̈ğ̈ T͜͡h͜͡a͜͡n͜͡k͜͡s͜͡ s͜͡o͜͡ m͜͡u͜͡c͜͡h͜͡ G͜͡e͜͡m͜͡m͜͡a͜͡💜💜💜
Can I just add the butter without melting them because I wanna make  about a hundred cookies and it would be a lot of trouble to melt all that butter...
Hi Gemma! I've always liked baking for fun but in reality, it's never been good. This time I was determined to finally make some delicious cookies. With this recipe and the help of your tips & others, I MADE DELECTABLE COOKIES THAT I'M PROUD OF! Thank you so much!!!
Pls tell me substitute of egg....
Hi Gemma, can you please make video on New York style cookies (levain cookies). 😅 They’re a bit more taller and their texture is quite different too.
Hi, can we do the browning butter for this kind of chocolate chip?
I made these using brown sugar but the sugar flakes were actually kind of big so they didn’t dissolve very much in the butter. And I wanted to know Gemma if that’s the reason my cookies weren’t so sweet 🍪
First try and turned out to be best one...thank u 🥰
Why don't you put exact amount on tje recipe, i found it hard for me to catch up as I'm not expert in bakery
Hi, miss gimma I made it already and it's really delicious I really love this chocolate cookies of you. Thank you for sharing this recipe.
Why don’t you write all ingredients listed under your videos ??  Would be much better and will save people’s time also!!
ugh i cant get enough of cookies🤯, they are my absolute favourite😍. I have to make this🤤, i have already made your crazy cookie dough twice😘, this time i froze half😊.
Do you think that maybe you could show us how to make candy canes? ☺
Quick question can you use mint chocolate instead of dark chocolate
My favourite thing in the world is cookies😍 especially classic chocolate chip 🍪
My oven has the option where i can  heat only the down part or the up part or i can heat both parts.....which option should i go with for cookies
After taking out the dough from the freeze do we need to keep it in room temperature for few minutes or we can bake it directly ?
Thanks so much for giving us so much tips you are so good and your recipes are even better thanks again aroshi from sri 🇱🇰
After taking out the cookies from oven do we need to cool it up or we can eat it immediately?
Gemma I tried these chocolate chip cookies...... Man they're awesome 👏👏!!!...From mom, dad to my granny.... Everybody loved this....Even my dad complimented that I can sell these cookies and also the brownies to my friends..... Thank you Gemma...  You've inspired me a way lot! 😘😘😘
Should I preheat the oven before baking these?
I think you have some great ideas, awesome recipes, and I appreciate your sharing them. I have a request, being my grandson is diabetic. I thought it was just about sugar, but it's also it's about carbs for diabetes. I'm hoping that perhaps you have some alternatives to sugar substitute, and low carb ideas. I've definitely earned my right to be Grandpa, lol, am a great cook, but don't have a clue how to do low carb, sugar free stuff. Please help if you have any ideas! Thank you 😊
Hi Gemma when u say we can freeze cookie dough upto 8 weeks wat does it means..it contains egg so don't we have to consider the expiry dt of eggs?
How I make a perfect cake please tell
What's the texture of cookies? Are they chewy?? Or they are crunchy Please tell
Wow
How many minutes do you preheat the oven?😊
Fresh out oven hot best
While adding choclate into batter is should be in which state?
My daughter  is making them they sound great
I am baking them
How long shud we preheat the oven
Which brand butter we should use for baking?
What can you use as a substitute for the butter
We tried this recipe today they turned out amazing and very delicious thank you for sharing this recipe
So can I use my fan assisted oven for this recipe?
Bake at whic mode? Lower rod on or both rods On
How does this compare to the crazy cookie dough cookies?
Ingredients 1 cup (8oz/225g) butter 1¼ cups (7 1/2oz/212g) light brown sugar ¾ cup (6oz/170g) white granulated/caster sugar 2½ cups (12 1/2oz/354g) all-purpose flour/plain flour 1½ teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon baking soda 2 large eggs* 2 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional, but encouraged) 2 cups (12oz/340g) bittersweet chocolate chunks
I tried this and it came out very well but the only thing is it was little skicky...... But tastes very well 😊btw thanks for this recipe... And iam from India love ur cooking ❤️
Definitely NOT crispy on the outside at all. Was more like cake. Dough was horrible to work with. Pass on this one. Stick with the Tollhouse recipe.
Best cookie recipe ever. Tried. Came out well Dr Pratap
You used melted butter instead of softened butter...... most of the recipes use creaming method to make cookies that's why I can't substitute with oil....can I use oil in this recipe to veganise it?
Always you don't put the ingredients
Can you explain mort the grames of ingredients
I have tried almost every single chocolate chip cookie recipe out there and this is simply the best. Make sure to age the dough and chill it.
Can I used dark brown sugar instead?
Hello how r u in i wont say can i make in pan i don't won't make u r pan recipe i wont make this one in pan so can i make in the pan plz miss so can i make this one cookies in pan not another cookie i wont make this one in pan so can i

favorite thing about this recipe: your lovely accent
Hi. How should I bake the cookies if I want them crispy throughout? My family actually loves crispy cookies, so if you could tell me please
what can i use instead of baking soda
I tried the recipe don't know why my dough was too dry so I added another egg and then it was great but I accidently added too much and now the cookies look great but aren't edible :(
i'm gonna try this,but if i use compound chocolate instead,should i reduce the amount of sugar? in the receipe it used dark chocolate 70% ,so the balance of bitter and sweet may differ right?i like mine not that sweet,do you have any tips?
I made my cookie dough and also chilled the dough. But it did not spread while baking time. I stayed firm as a ball even while and after baking. Please advise.
Made the dough yesterday along with the best internet chewy ones and hands down THE best chocolate chip cookies ever!!!!!!! My husband is so happy!!! Baked both today to compare and I just have to say....there goes my diet! THANK YOU SO MUCH GEMMA!!! 😘😘😘

Hi Gemma, these are the best chocolate chip cookies that I hv ever eaten n made, super yummy 😋
Can i ask? Do i need to cool down 1st the melted butter? .. Before i put the other ingredients?
That moment you find the perfect chocolate chip cookie recipe but you don't have chocolate chips                                    ;v
Hi Gemma! Should you grease the parchment paper?
Amazingly GOOD, making them again, second time.
Made these cookies but didn't  have the chocolate. I did have chopped Kit Kat bars, worked fine. Best cookies EVER AND SO EAZY!
Can we use vegetable oil instead of butter
I am 10 years old and I am really inspired to cook by all your easy, delicious recipes. I am a really big fan of you! Thank you for all your content!
Hi! I'm just wondering how come my cookies come out kind of tall and kind of fatter in size? They taste amazing btw but they harden overtime? Is that normal? Or was I using less butter? Would adding butter solve it? Would really love an answer. Thank you so much! 🍪
This Chocolate Chip Cookies recipe looks so delicious Gemma.
4th time to make this recipe.The best chocolate cookie recipe ever!
Can i bake these in the microwave? If yes at what temperature and for how long?
Hey Gemma...Made these cookies today and they were an absolute hit!!! Love them.. Thanks for sharing ur talent ❤
I watched this video right after I ate the last bar of chocolate o.o
Can we use coconut sugar?
I made these a week ago and there were definitely a hit with the family. I decided to brown my butter for that extra touch, but ultimately the recipe is easy and straightforward. I would recommend putting it in the oven between 10 to 11 mins and then adjust.
Love watching you show how to MAKE so many yummy goodies. Going to try these cookies for sure. Great idea aging dough  Gotta try these too.
Gemma,  Thank you for sharing this awesome recipe!! I had it a week ago and  I have now ditched my go to recipe for this one!!!
I never get the same result..even I used exactly same recipe..please guide
Hi how long do i bake if i dont want a gooey centr?? But a firm centre
😍😍😍😍I love your cakes 🎂
Butter is too expensive here. Can i substitute it with margarin with the same ratio?
Fell in love with this recipe tbh. Good job
Which brand chocolate u are using mam?
Hi Gemma! Love from Malaysia ❤️ I tried the recipe for so many times and yes, it's the best recipe. I added some caramel syrup on top with some sea salt flakes and it tastes heavenly. Thumbs up! And btw, do you know what should I do to reheat the cookies? Can I reheat them in the oven or in the air fryer?
Hi Gemma. Could you please tell me if I could make them on stove. If I could what steps to take.
Hi Gemma. Can I use brown butter in place of melted butter in this recipe? I'm a huge fan of brown butter. Wanted to incorporate that in your recipe. Help a girl out :)
Hi Gemma, can walnuts be added to your cookie recipe?  Will this change the consistency of the cookie or cookie time? I love chocolate chips and walnuts in cookies.
Is there anyway I can incorporate brown butter into this recipe?
what will happen if i use margarine instead of butter? Would it be cake like?
For how long can these cookies be stored
Merry Christmas 🎄 Hi this recipe looks great and I want to use wheat flour instead and so do I still need to refrigerate it and also which rack do u keep in the oven
Hey gemma i tried these cookies but my dough was quite wet nothing like yours. I put it in the fridge for an hour but still it was too sticky i couldn't form balls then i added some flour to it and let it chill again for half an hour. Then it was manageable but when I baked the cookies  they were overly sweet 🥺☹️ like unpleasantly sweet. I might have packed the brown sugar alot i guess!! And next time I'll use my scale instead of cup measurements. This was my first ever try at making cookies of any kind. Maybe i chose a difficult recipe. Can you tell me an easy one to try first.
Why does this smeell like egsssss😖
Hi Gemma! I love this recipe . It’s a big hit 😊. The cookies turned out exactly as your’s did Crispy on the outside and Gooey in the centre . I am probably your youngest fan who is just 11 . I started loving baking because of you . Your videos are Awesome and your step by step instructions on the website as well as the video really helped ! Thank you so much ☺️ .
Perfect and yummm! As usual...
I just baked this and this is the best cookies recipe I've ever made!! I added a lot of chocolate chunks than I should, taste even better! Chilling them overnight gives so much caramel flavor. Thank you so much for sharing this with us Gemma. 🤗❤
Nothing like a home-made cookies to start the day😋
Questions I'm making my dough tonight 12/21/20, I'm not baking them until 12/23/20. Do I still have to let them chill in the fridge; for an  additional 30 minutes after rolling them in a ball?
What will happen to my cookies if I use baking powder instead of baking soda?
Do i have to preheat the oven? And my oven has an option to turn on/off the heat from top and bottom. Do i use both or just the bottom?
My microwave is 900 watts, the cookies didn't bake for 15 minutes, have kept again, plz help me dear
I've tried a couple different recipes and NONE of them compare to yours! Cookies came out soft, chewy, and spread well. This will definitely be my go- to recipe moving forward. Thanks for your help!
I tired making this but my cookie dough ended up being too runny and sticky. I measured everything out correctly but I don't know what else to do.. :(
1 star,  are these cooking’s amazing? Yes they are. My problem, is that Gemma has become so greedy with ad revenue that you now have to visit 3 websites just to get the recipe. She does not tell you the list of ingredients in this video, you have to go to her website t get that. And then there is her video telling you what is wrong with this video justo make the cookies. Three over te top ad filled websites to make one cookie. All the while inundated with more ads than anyone should be subjected to, for ONE recipe encaustic she refuses to give you all the details in nlocation.
Alternate for eggs?
Just made these, its so good.
Hi Gemma what is the percentage range chocolate I can use? The cookies look good! I will make it this weekend! Bye!
How i can i bake these cookies in stove???
Smh, I followed this recipe, even chilled the dough. Still  ended up with with flat oily cookies 😢
Hi Gemma can you use chocolate chips?
I’ve never chunked a chocolate bar. What’s the best chocolate to use in the U.S?
Thanks Gemma  Love from  India  Tried and turned out better than store bought cookie  One  doughthow to adjust time according to cookie size Thanks
Can I use a hand mixer for this recipe?
I have a question, for the melted butter can I mix it even if its still hot or do I need to wait for it cool down?
Hi Gemma, this is a lovely recipe. Planning to give it a try. Wanted to confirm - we do not preheat the oven right?  TIA
Going to make them for distributing across neighborhood on my baby boy's first b'day 🎉
Years ago my mother  made a soft chewy cookie that she filled with either apricot or strawberry preserves. I believe these  are called pillow cookies and I’ve not been able to replicate the recipe. Can you help? I hope the recipe didn’t die with her.
I MADE THESE COOKIES FEW MONTHS BACK AND THEY WERE SUPER AMAZING ....I used a flax egg and it worked just as good.

Most importantly, I'm unable to open the recipe link. Pls share here. Thank you so much.

How many eggs, butter, sugar and flour do I need to make cookies for about 560 children in a boarding school?
Can I use less sugar? Or will it affect the texture? ☺️ ~okay I made these cookies (with white chocolate) but the center is a bit darker that the rest like it’s wet, I tried rebaking them in the oven for 3 mins but they are still like that. Is it undercooked? It’s fine with me, but is it safe to eat it?
Those chocolate chip cookies look very delicious!!!
Hi, just tried tried them. I added almost 1/2 a cup of flour. They didnt spread out as much as I expected. The cookies tasted great! I love the crunchy- soft balance, thanks:)
Hi Gemma I made these yesterday but my cookies never spread, Also, the cookie dough looked a bit more stiff than yours.Moreover, the cookie burnt from below while baking at 15 minutes only. Tasted great nonetheless. Please help me with this.
love this recipe thank you gemma
Hey, I don't know if this happens with me or anyone else, but whenever I bake, also this cookie, the taste was amazing, it cooked out amazing but idk why but my cookies rise and get like risen.  So why does that happen? And what do I do for a flat cookie. PS: I kept them in the fridge too.
my cookie dough turned out too soft and after baking they were still too soft and don't hold their shape at all. i had to put them in the fridge to give some structure to them. I put them in the fridge and some I even froze and baked them the next day.
Do we need to preheat the oven for cookies

hello please some one share the recipe... i cant get it... ingredients
I made these cookies they turned out really well it was just they were too sweet for me.
Used oven toaster to bake but bottom of cookies is burnt. I only baked 3 cookies. Do I need to lower down the temperature or maybe baked it only 6 minutes?
Gemma won’t dough become hard if i put it for aging fr days? How to scoop then?
Hi,do we bake cookies with the lower heating rod on or both the rods on.
They look fantastic , where can i get a printable recepie/instructions x
I made these again but with half the amounts called for coz I didn't want to make so many of them ... I somehow messed it up completely ... The cookies didn't cook in 12 mins n didn't get to being flat but were very hard  ... I still loved the taste 😍 n it was completely devoured by my family but no idea what I did wrong 🤣🤣 ... For some t was too sweet .. any guidelines how to make these beauties but with lesser sugar content ? I have a baby shower coming up for a friend  n these were requested even though this s literally my 3rd attempt at baking cookies 🤷🤷🤷 .. wud luv the help ... Also I tried making these in a separate batch in a cupcake tray so I can have a filling of dark chocolate or nut butters since I was having a Eureka moment , top cooked n bottom didn't n filling of the different chocolates I put in like kit kat n all dried out , so did peanut butter n pistachio butter (homemade)... I baked t longer n t too was hard coz I have no idea how long they're supposed to be in there ... 🤷🤷  m soooo amateur it's painful ... any thoughts wud be helpful coz I have a week to get t right for the shower ?
Gemma, for aging the dough, do you keep it in the fridge or the freezer during that 3-5 days?
I tried this, these are truly the best ever choco chip cookies 😍. Thankyou Gemma for this fabulous recipe
Chocolate chip chunkage!!!! Oh yes indeed!! I’m a fan forever now!!! Love it!
Hi Gemma. My chocolate chip cookie batter always ends up like a really thick cake batter. Whhhyyy??? Please help!
I only used a pinch of baking soda and my cookie has puffed a lot from centre and is cakey why is it so ?
Can I freeze these cookies, when it's already cooked? Will it have an influence on the texture?
omg i made these and it is so so good! thank you
hey gemma , one quick question , how long this cookies stays fresh ? if  I want to back big batch for crowd and also to sell them  professionally what  kind of precautions  i need to take ,? and for them to stay fresh longer what should i keep in mind while i back them ?
Made these cookies 🍪 and they were definitely the best I’ve ever eaten 💗💕 Thanks so much Gemma ❤️
I’ve done the tasty cookies and they turned out perfect but I’ve used the same recipe like 7 times more and it was just a fail fest from the second try to the seventh. Idk what went wrong but watching this, somehow everything makes sense all of a sudden. Like I found my eureka moment. I will try this recipe for my next batch, thank you so much! 💙
and can we skip the chunks?
can we use whet flour
Please someone tell me!! I’ve made these “don’t flatten cookies” recipes that it’ll be flat by itself but ITS NEVER HAPPENED TO MINE!,😭😭😭😭😭 I swear by all her recipes but am I crazy here that I have to flatten at some point?
I made it twice now, that shows a lot since I usually don't remake recipes..  This is amazing, I'm obsessed
I don't know why my dough didn't came out thick and dense as your video... Do I need to put extra flour when this happens? What could I do wrong? O puta the exact amount of ingredients... maybe 2 eggs is too much? Help please
Hi my oat meal cookies are soft can I put them again in the oven?
Hello please what are the measurements for the ingredients
Can we use chocolate chips instead of chunks of chocolates??
Where can I see the substitutes of egg for all different items like what for cake and what for cookies and so on?
I made these cookies and it was really really good 🥺. But just one thing I had to flatten my cookie because scoping right away didn't work the first time I did it. (I did chill the dough).
My cookies were cakey. What can I do to avoid that?
Hii Gemma I baked these and I must say that I also tried baking other cookie recipes including the tasty one but this one so far was my  favorite..... You are always an inspiration...... Love from India!!!!!
Hi Gemma. Thanks for this recipe. I am a newbie in baking and I tried this recipe as my first try on baking making sure I follow exactly how you told. It came out good as in the video but had just one doubt. I feel the cookie gets little hard after keeping it for few days. So I wanted to know is there any tip so that the cookies will still remain crunchy and not hard after few days also. PS: The taste was soo good and everybody liked it 🙂
Why aren't the measurements not said !?
Gemma is a great chef her recipe looks so delicious
Been making these every 6 months for the past 2.5 years. 💯 The only recipe that I'll ever use. Even my fussy partner loves these! Can add or remove chocolate/dried fruit /nuts and it still tastes 👌 also love the brownie recipe hehe but I think I've already commented on there long time ago
why mine is won't spread out?? :((( please i need help
Hey, what does it mean if my cookies don't flatten in the oven

Hi. Were you using a convection fan oven?
Can we use food dye to look like pizza cookies
hi gemma, i've made this recipe twice before and it turned out great. i was planning on making it again soon, but using raw turbinado sugar. do you think that the cookies will still turn out the same with turbinado, or is it best to work with white sugar? thank you in advance!
Dear Gemma, can we bake this in stove top... bcz I dont have oven.. plzz reply dear...I need to make it...
Could listen to you all day!  Great video!
Dear Gemma, I am going to bake these absolutely yum looking chocolate chip cookies, since I didn't have 72% chocolate, I have added in 70% chocolate, I hope that this small difference doesn't spoil my cookies

Hi Gemma I want your phone number

Best cookies ever! I can’t say up eating them.
I made these today after aging them 3 days and I absolutely loved them !!! Thank you sooo much ... I am now a channel regular 😄😄  ... I would luv it if you could make a pistachio cream filled cookie like the Tiger Cookies pistachio cookies... Would luv it if you could find the best ever one for it ... 😁😁😁
Hi Gemma! May I ask.. 1.) After 1 hour chilling, do I put straight in the oven or wait for it for room temp?  2.) OMG PLEASE DO TELL ME WHERE YOU GET THAT CUTE MEASURING CUPS 😊  Thanks for the vid and recipe!
Chef Gemma! I just wanted to ask why cookies have WAY SO MUCH sugar in it. This always makes my cookies sweet, not the way I want it. Anyway, can I reduce it and by how much without affecting the texture drastically? Thank you!
I lke it....but can you make biscuits without oven... because there is no oven in my home🙂🙂
Super......
Hey I made eggless version of it and used condense milk as per the measurement u gave but my cookie turned out to be flat and it had crisp and hard edge and loads of butter was oozing out .!! Can you temme what changes can I make?
I really want to make these, but if I cut down the sugar, how will that affect the result
Could I use brown butter (cooking butter till brown) in this?
Hi, I already try this recipe a 2nd time, why is it I always ended a wet mixture? Please help thank you!
These are not the best.... they are the BESTEST EVER. Super recipe; try it once and you are hooked forever. Btw, if you have not checked out Gemma's website yet, do go in... it's a treasure trove of great, easy recipes and loads of practical and DIY stuff; essential repertoire for a home chef😛
How many does this make??
Hi Gemma When I scoop my cookies they dont spread like yours on their own. Can you help me to let me know why they dont flatten out on their own?
1 cup (8oz/225g) butter 1¼ cups (7 1/2oz/212g) light brown sugar ¾ cup (6oz/170g) white granulated/caster sugar 2½ cups (12 1/2oz/354g) all-purpose flour/plain flour 1½ teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon baking soda 2 large eggs* 2 teaspoon vanilla extract, optional 2 cups (12oz/340g) bittersweet chocolate chunks  Whisk the flour, salt, and baking soda in a medium bowl. Set aside. In a separate bowl melt the butter. Add in both white and brown sugars and whisk vigorously for about 1 minute. Whisk in one egg to the sugar-butter mixture, stirring until it's fully mixed in. Scrape the sides of the bowl with your spatula. Whisk in the second egg and the vanilla and then scrape the sides of the bowl again. Add the dry ingredients to the wet and stir with the spatula to fully combine. Make sure you've scraped the bottom of the bowl and there are no streaks of dry ingredients left. Stir in the chocolate chips. The dough will be soft but DON'T add more flour. It needs to be chilled now to firm up. IMPORTANT NOTE: Chill the dough for a minimum of 1 hour. This will make it easier to scoop and your cookies will keep their shape better while baking. (This dough can be made and kept in the fridge for 7 days. The dough also freezes really well) Scoop 14-15 balls of cookie dough (1/4 cup/100g each) and place on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Leave some space between the cookies as they spread out during baking. Bake the cookies at 375°F (190°C) for about 12-15 minutes roughly, or until the edges are set and the cookie is beginning to turn golden brown throughout, but still doughie in the middle. It is really important you don't over bake these cookies otherwise they won't be soft in the middle.  Once out of the oven bang the hot pan on the counter a few times to create crinkles on top of the cookie (see tips). Let cool on the sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Store them at room temperature in an airtight container for up to 3 days.
Hey Gemma, I tried this but my dough turned out to be too hard and cookies had a soar/bitter taste in them. May be because of more flour and baking soda? Can you please help?
I made these cookies for my daughter's school teacher's day celebration. They turned out very well. Crunchy outside, chewy inside. The whole class loved it. Thank you so much Gemma. Love your recipes.
Hihi, i have tried this recipe for 2 times, but why do i end up with gooey batter? Your batter dun look gooey.
It is quite hard to find the receipt through the link.
Good day! I love watching your videos. Is it alright if I only use brown sugar? If so, how many cups of it?  My family is trying to avoid the usage of white sugar.
Do you have a chocolate chip cookie recipe that is suitable for diabetes
can i use softened butter instead of melted
I made these for my parents and 7 yr old brother since I'm ten! It came out great and proves how easy this is! I'm litteraly ten!
I made these with my grandma before she passed away. I feel like I'm emotionally attached with this recipe, if that makes sense.
Just made this today and they cake out amazing! Thank you so much for this recipe, I will definitely be using this from now on
Oh my so yummy chocolate chips cookies😊. I love this recipe 😍😍
Hey, is it okay to leave out the baking soda if I do not want that raise? Thank you so much for this recipe!
Made these today and all I can say is WOW !!!!!!! Fantastic recipe. 👍
Helloo Gemma, I am really curious on how I bake my cookie dough from the freezer. Should I let it rest first in a room temperature, or can I just bake it right after I take it out from the freezer. I would really appreciate if you could share your tips. Thank you.
update<3 just made these cookies (again) and it turned our really well!! my boyfriend and my friends really like it, they were saying it was really good, thank you for this amazing recipe
Even if I can freeze it upto 12 weeks these are not going to last more than a few days if you let me eat them😂
Its definitely the *best* chocolate chip cookie recipe ever I think everyone who has tasted them will agree
Hey Gemma, any thoughts on making cookies like Chips ahoy alternative which are quite thick but maintains a crispy texture, something that is delectable to snack on? I love chewy cookies but sometimes I'm looking for that crunchy-but-not-too-hard cookie fix
These cookies were phenomenal!
Gemma may i ask you? Why my cookie didn’t spread like yours?
Hi, can i make cookie dough bowl with this receipe?
i just make these cookies with the exact recipe you gave, and how can i stop my chocolate chunks to leak out of the cookie and burn?
Hey Gemma,I love all your recipes (especially the scones-they taste just like the ones we got at school in Ireland).Just wanted to know-can I brown the butter for this recipe?  Thanks! :)
THESE WERE AMAZING my whole family loved them they weren’t over sweet and they were very gooey and delicious never using anyone else’s recipe!! Hands down BEST recipe thabkyou so much Gemma!!
Hey gemma i have a question. I would appreciate if you hear me out. Im quite interested in your recipe. But if i scoop 100g out for all the cookies right after making its dough. Make the balls and freeze them overnight. And then the next day i heat the oven and the baking tray before taking the cookies out of the fridge. Once its nicely heated then i put all my chilled cookie balls on hot baking tray.  Can u tell me if this process effects the texture and the flatness of the cookie?? I want them to look like yours. But im afraid if i dont get as flattened as yours. I dont want my cookies to be thicker in the center.
Kindly share the details and measurements of the ingredients? Thankyouu
Hi what is i dont want a gooey texture from the middle i just wa t the normal cookies all round
Hi Gemma, Love your channel and all of your recipes!  Would you do a Best Ever Zucchini Bread?  Love you!
This recipe is amazing. The dough is so easy to make. I made around 24 normal sized cookies. The dough was crazyyyyy. They were delicious. I totally recommend this recipe.
I am a biggest fan of your recipe I just want to tell kindly write ingredens in description
Gemma can you please make  crunchy cookies video?
Dear Gemma, I tried this recipe yesterday, and it tasted great but it slightly sweeter to my taste. Can I reduce the sugar but still have beautiful crack?? If I reduce the sugar how much? Thank you
Hi Gemma😻 can i half the sugar in this recipe? will it affect the texture? thanks in advance
About the chocolate.... can we use 90% dark chocolate or would it be too bitter?
Is it one teaspoon baking soda ?
Wheree are the measurements????????
Hi all  She mentioned that instead of egg we can use something... I want to know the egg substitute... please help. It looks so amazing n I want to try these super soon
I am telling you I made these cookies today and my cookies never came out well but after eating this my reaction was oh my fucking god like it was so tasty I don't think I am ever gonna get store bought cookies thank you Gemma you are the best!
Family and friends agree this is the best chocolate chip cookie recipe I have ever made for them. I found it easiest to make the dough the night before and form it into a log about 18" long and around 2" diameter to put in the fridge overnight. Next day (no measuring) I cut it into 16 equal sized pieces by cutting it in half each time until I have 16 dough rounds. They end up perfect sized at a little over 1" thick for the baking sheet and at the 12 - 13 minute mark in our preheated (at measured temp for at least 10 minutes) oven they are done to absolute perfection. The extra wack (#9 instruction from your website) before putting them on the cooling rack makes them look divine with all the cracks open to the doughy goodness inside. Thanks Gemma PS - I decided to try this no measure way of dividing the dough because the dough was so stiff when I made this recipe the first time that it broke my dough scoop. The cookies came out so awesome I had to find a way to make them again without my scoop. Maybe the butter is softer in Ireland so it makes a softer refrigerated dough. I will have to try with the Kerrygold butter available in the US some day to compare.  Baking Bolder Everyday
I really would live to try this with egg substitute as condensed milk but I'm worried about the sweetness of the cookies . Wouldn't it be too sweet?? Please help
I will make it....sure
Hi Gemma! I made these cookies few days ago and they were just perfect ,Iam so happy your recepie rocks!! Making them again today, is there some platform where I can share pics with you?😊
Hi, I made the cookies today it came out perfect👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻except the chocolate didn’t melt😞 I used compound chocolate... what should be done to make it gooey.. any advice.. thank you😊
Can you show the best recipe to make chewy white chocolate chip cookies recipe please

You really do make excellent recipes and you really inspire me to bake for my family and I have never baked in my life Thank you Gemma. ❤❤❤
Hi Gemma! I made these cookies today and followed your recipe, but I was only able to use 7oz butter instead of 8oz. The dough is now sitting in our freezer, but I noticed how buttery/oily it looks (I melted the butter in our oven instead of a microwave). Is that normal, or did I do something wrong with the butter? Thanks!
i want to make it crispy from the inside and outside, how do i make it
Hi Gemma, can I reduce the amount of sugar for this recipe? If so, how much can I reduce without affecting the texture and overall taste of the cookies?
I made your coffee cake it was delicious, trying the oatmeal and chocolate chip cookies tonight
Can we use dark chocolate compound?
Hi gemma I'm a fan from​ India  and I try this recipe 😊 it's so good and yummy thank you dear thanks a lot
Did any one share half of the recipe....
I wanna ask most recipe indicates to cream the butter and sugar but what you did is you mixed the melted butter and sugar is there a difference between the two. And about pre heating the oven should i pre heat it in the same cooking temp.. I'm confuse because sometime recipe ask to increase or lessen the temp in pre heating.. Thanks in advance I'm really trying to learn how to bake for my family..
Please I need measurements for this  cookies

Thank you ..for ur super receipe ..i  finally got a correct measurement ..
This is seriously and wonderfully the best chocolate chip cookie recipe ever made and I'm not lying! This is a must-try!  Gemma, you would be really a heaven-sent if you'd pull off microwave cookies that taste the same!   Sending so much love from the Philippines!
This recipe didn’t work quite well for me :( I would suggest not to use salted butter as the taste of the salt just overpowers everything I want to taste in a cookie! I chilled the cookie dough in the fridge overnight and it did hold it’s structure to the extent that the cookie turned out high like a mountain and it was so cakey... would also suggest to start baking the cookies at a much lower temperature as my batch of cookies were almost burnt with the temp in this recipe
I want to make this so bad
WHAT IS THE POTION OF THE INGREDIENTS?
: 0
Hey Gemma, my cookie dough is a bit runny than yours, is it because of the climate on where I am located (Philippines)? after mixing it I did put it in the fridge and will bake it tomorrow morning.
I want to lessen the sweetness .Can i use glucose syrup?how many tbsp ??
Can anyone tell me what can substitute an egg?
Thank you Gemma!! I am 12 and because of you can bake cinnamon rolls, cookies, mug meals, croissants, no machine ice-cream and more...🤩🤩🤩
How can we replace eggs from this recipe.......
I just tried doing this today for the first time, following all the steps and the tips you gave, and my cookies turned out amazing! Thank you again for this lovely recipe ❤
Hi Gemma, Thank you for sharing this! I used this for my business and it went great and success thank you
Please provide the exact measurements mam
I tried this last night and my dough looked crumbly. I chilled it overnight and when i took it out of the ref, it looked dry and crumbly still so i melted more butter and added it in to the dough. My dough is now in the ref hopefully i could scoop them and bake them later.
at 4:15 there was metal in the dough
I made and it was delicious . Everyone loved it . Thank you
Ilang mins po pde ibake sa mini oven toaster po?
Hi Gemma, mine turned out cakey, do you have any suggestion how I can avoid this? Thanks! Much love from the Philippines
Will it be ok if i chop chocolate compound and put it in cookies??
I tried your recipe.. the results were amazing..
I just tried them. Amazing. Best recipe ever. Thanks you. Lucas, from Buenos Aires, Argentina.
hi jemma after chilling the cookie dough in the fridge for an hour do you bake them in the oven straight away or leave them out for a few minutes?
After trying so many choc chip recipe, by far this recipe and Anna Olsen choc recipe is the best, as long you following the instructions carefully it came out just like cookies in the video, crispy on the edge and chewy in the center, thank for the recipe 😘😘😘😘
Does it really matter if you half recipes?
Hello,what if I add baking powder??Is it okay??

Hello,Can I simply double or triple ALL the measurement of the ingredients if I want to create a bigger batch??Do I need to worry about the baking soda or the flour??Thank you❤
Loved it  Just couldn’t use chocolate bar so used chocolate chips
Oh Gemma, you are right!  These cookies are      awesomely indescribably seriously delicious !  😋😋😋😋
Can someone help with this one? Do we need to preheat the oven? And den let the cookies go in? My cookies are turning flat within 5 mins after it goes inside. Can u please explain me the reason to the flat cookies pls
So what are the measurements
Hello Gemma..  I have been following most of your recipes. Infact alot of it has been superb like the sandwich bread cheesecake and these 🍪.   Though these cookies are super super tasty. Somehow I don't get the rite shape. They just flatten out. Wut could be the reason? I have followed exactly step to step . Do I need to refrigerate it? Or freeze the batter?  Pls help. I could make around 22 to 25 cookies in all with this whole propotion . Am I taking a small scoop? Is that the reason? It speads out flat? Pls help. Also I want to ask. Should I add baking soda to this for it to rise a bit?
Hi Gemma!  I love your videos!  I tried your Cookie recipes and they came out great.  I just find it to sweet for me.  I want to reduce the amount of sugar.  Could you suggest how much sugar I should use?
Hello! I would like to make this recipe with browned butter, may I know what alterations to the original recipe would I need to make to achieve the same results?
Thank you so much for sharing this recipe love from Pakistan 🇵🇰 ❤️🥰
Could you make this on a stovetop?
The amount I don’t know
Hello Gemma Can I replace the butter with sunflower oil
Hiya! If it’s possible - How much flour would I omit and cocoa would I add to make this a double choc chip recipe? 😊
wonderful cookie recipe! where can i get that beautiful measuring tspoon???
Man I love your recipes. They are so easy and yummy
What can I use to substitute the amount of sugar, I did not want it to be too sweet
Hi bold baking i made these cookies today but it came out a disaster it looks like bread not cookie can u tell me wat i did wrong
Hello gemma! Can i use unsalted butter instead? Will i increase the amount of salt if i use unsalted?
Hi gemma! It's me again aha. All i have is unsalted butter. Can i use that instead of salted? And if i use unsalted, will i increase the amount of salt? Thank you!!
My cookies didnt flatten out as in the video  .. can you please tell me the reason for that??
Hey Gemma! Loved the cookies! For me personally they were a bit too sweet and buttery! I'll definitely be reducing the butter and sugar quantity the next time I make these! Thanks for your lovely videos❤️
How can I make without measurements???

Can I use dark brown sugar instead of light brown?
Woah I’ll try this for sure😍

Best chocolate chip cookies I have ever made hands down. I feel like I won the lottery with finding your video. Thx for all the secret tips! I’m gonna try your brownies next! ❤️
Hi! Is there no need to pre heat the oven? :)
A lot of people put up recipes claiming it's the "best ever"....you don't understand...These cookies truly are!! And I always have baking disasters and for mine to turn out so great...🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼  Thank you for the recipe!!

Hi gemma! What are the  measurements for the half of the recipe?
Great recipe i just hv 1 question can we use brown butter in these ?
This is the best choc chip cookie recipe ever! Better than the other recipes I've tried. Greetings from South Africa💖
Can we use jaggery instead of sugar?
Gemma I tried this...the flavour was awesome however the cookies spread out within the first 2-3 mins then they all joined together...i refrigerated it first .....why would this happen? It turned out a disaster... :(
Do i need to preheat my oven?
Defiantly my favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe of all time! You need to try this recipe out if you haven't. soooooo goooood
These look so good! Good job 👍🏼
I will forever be waiting for a baking book from you after this recipe , I’ve been trying to find a nice chewy chocolate chip cookie and thanks to you i now have it ❤️
Hello Gemma! Question: what should be my convection oven's setting for baking this? Should it be top and bottom heat? Or bottom only? Thanks!
the cookie dough tastes so nice..
Can you please share a recipe for Red Velvet Cookies.
what chocolate is best to for cookies
I really enjoy your recipe videos, but have to enjoy them vicariously. Most of your recipes aren't diabetic-friendly. I was hoping that at some point you might consider including a few recipes that would be diabetic-friendly? possibly make some recipes that replace sugar with something like Splenda? some (not necessarily all) of the flour with coconut or almond flour? I've tried improvising recipes within this guidelines, but not having the experience I never quite get them right, and not completely understanding the baking science, I don't know which ingredients need to be either eliminated/replaced or amounts adjusted. just some "food" for thought ;-) Thank you again for truly enjoyable recipes (and that lovely accent you have).
Best chocklit cookese
Hi Jemma do you use a fan oven for your recipes? I have a fan oven and am not sure if this will affect the temperature I should set my cookies on for your recipe

Gemma these cookies are amazing. Can you show me the recipe of buttercookies
Just made these today and OMG they are sooo amazing !! 😍😍😍😍🤤🤤🤤🤤❤️❤️❤️🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻 thanks Gemma!
I have two questions, first is about the amount of salt, isn't it going to be too salty if we put 1.5 tsp salt + salted butter, also I will be using half the amount of chocolate cuz we don't like it too chocolaty, so I was wondering if it will be too salty with half amount of chocolate. Secondly how many cookies roughly it will make?
1 1/4 cups equals 20 spoons of flour ?
I really like your cookies and Popsicles recipe thank you
So. If you don’t know if these actually work. THEY ARE AMAZING AND EASYY.. This week I messed up almost every single thing that I cooked or baked. But this is amaziiiing!!
Hi I did see ur egg substitute chart, but can I use 1/2 cup of yogurt for 2 large eggs for this cookie ? Reply plz

Yum definitely will give it a try!🍪🍪🍪💞 Thank u soooooooo much because this will make quarantine much better!❤🌍🌍🌍🌍 They are absolutely  incredible! Big and Bold:) Stay safe Gemma❤
My batter was slightly liquidy than this. What do I do
How would it be if I use oatmeal flour instead of normal flour?
On your site it says to bake from cold. Just wondering what that means. Btw i love your recipes im 13 and made brownies for the first time using your recipes and my family loveddd them!!!
What if you don't have brown sugar??
Tasty has a really good chocolate chip cookie too, it's in the 2min, 2hour, 2 day cookie, as you have guessed 2 day is the best
wonderful wonderful!! so tasty!! i am now going to do a second batch, will  i need to defrost (from the freezer) for a few hours before baking?  i am really dont know.  as they will be rock solid if i bake straight from the freezer.  thank you Cookie princess!!
Mam u make round balls from d dough u didn't flat it in cookie shape before baking y
They look so good 😛
Can't wait to try this recipe!! Tho is the texture going to be the same if i don't prefer to add white sugar? Tyank you 💖💖
This is the BEST cookie recipe. I repeat. The BEST.   Better than all the viral ones including Tasty’s. Tried that too. Was way toooooo sweet.
Gemma, such a delicious cookie!!! I love all your segments :) I just need to find out why mine come out all flat? I even chilled the dough in the fridge for a few hours. They taste amazing but look like pancakes. Ha!! The family still love them though :)
Hi Gemma, is it okay if I cook the butter a bit longer until it is slightly brown?
Does the melted butter have to cool first
Watching these during quarantine and they look so good 🍪 😋🥺
Coming from a chocaholic, there can never be enough chocolate chip “chunkage”! Delicious!
My cookies turned out very soft and flat
Hi Gemma, can I use whole wheat flour ¿ if yes, should I change any other ingredient quantities
Can I use white chocolate instead as i am out of dark one
Can we make these cookies on stove top... Like in the steel pot?
This really was an amazing recipe!!
I made these today and they came out so good!!! The ingredients were simple, and the recipe is so easy to follow. I’m not a perfect baker but this turned out so well thank u so much!!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND
what temp should we preheat the oven for?
I just did them and they are Amazing! My Oven was off so I did 350 for 10 min. At .46grams.  Enjoy!
Can these be made with self raising flour instead of plain and bicarbonate of soda?
😮 wow wow thank you 🙏 so much
Plzzzz I really want to bake this recipe what are the measurements
Does it stay soft and chewy after a few days? thanks!
I'm looking at the ingredient portions, and Gemma's seem to be the best.  Adjusting for amounts, she doesn't use as much sugar as others do, which addresses the common "it's too sweet" complaint.  I also like that she uses bittersweet dark chocolate, which should balance out the sweetness.  Her cookies look nice and dark.  She also recommends refrigerating the dough for an extended period, which the real "pros" all do.
Thank you Gemma me and my daughter gonna make this tonight ❤️ she is so excited 🥰
I made these and the cookies  baked perfectly but there is a bad taste of baking soda in them.what should i do.
This recipe is hands down, the best recipe EVER!
Tried these and they turned out so great!! Could you possibly make thing cookie crisps? I love snacking on really thin cookie/brownie crisps and would like to make them at home. It would be great for toppings on ice cream or cakes! Please 😩
Yuuumm! I was planning to do the brownies today and I ended up doing these cookies, super good, I couldn't stop eating the cookie dough. I put them in the fridge for an hour and a half before baking them, when I took them out their edges were good but the inside still tender so I wasn't sure if I took them out too early but if you leave them out for 5 min they still cook and they're perfect. Make sure to leave plenty of space around the dough balls so that they don't stick because they spread quite a bit.
Hi 👋, I followed your perfect instructions and it came out well 👍😃
Can you do a more healthy version on those cookies
What brand of chocolate should I use? Do I have to use cooking chocolate?
Hi Gemma, I just made these and it is so devine! Thank you for your detailed instructions 😊
I can't find the receipe, can anyone write it please
hey! im making the cookies and something’s wrong. im mixing the brown and the white sugar with the melted butter and when i mixed it, it was crumbly?? and not a paste? should i add more meted butter? help
I'm a student. I tryed this and it's amazing it' s SOOOO good and easy to make your videos are really good im in quarantine so it's nice that i don't need to go to a store. I saved one for my grandma (very hard for me) and she loved it. All the other cookie videos say it's easy and it takes about 3 YEARS to make.
Thanks This really helped my family loved it!
Chunkage       My new favourite word
Today  I was  see your  channel   I was  subcribe  and like video Please subcribe  my channel  please
If its gooey in the middle, doesn't that mean the middle is a little uncooked
Is it baking powder or baking soda that u added? Both are different
2:47 -  Chocolate Chip CHUNKAGE!!! 🍫
Quick question: how come you always separate the dry and wet ingredients?
Thank You sooo much for your videos  and recipes I tried the chocolate cake in a cup and Loved it now today I'll try the chocolate chip cookie recipe. Stay safe and well. again thank you
Can u give tips to make the same in microwave. I don’t have oven
to age your dough, should you keep it in the fridge?
Can I use wheat flour. I want to make healthy
Salted butter !!   YES YES YES !!   I ALWays Use salted butter as well.. and for EXACTLY the same reason you state !  THANK YOU for the validation !  : ]
i tried this and omg they turned out AMAZING!thank u so much for sharing this recipe with us!
Can I use oil instead of butter?
Where do I find the amounts of ingredients?
I made them and the dough seems too lose and greasy do you have any suggestions what did I made a mistake on? I can’t figure it out :(
At what temperature shall we bake it in a microwave of 900°C.
Is baking soda baking power?  Is it the same
how to make sure that the chocolate chunks that we are adding will melt and we will get the gooey chocolate?
Ok so I have everything but salted butter,i have unsalted. So hoo much more salt should I add?
How long in a microwave?
Hi i just realised u never say whether its granulated sugar or caster sugar?   From what i see you putting your brown sugar seems very fine.  Either way can you please tell which type?
Made the dough, ageing half of it and just chilling the rest to see the difference😁but the dough looks and smells delish! Lots of love from ireland❤️🇮🇪🍀  Update:the simply chilled for one day cookie dough tasted delicious! Ageing the rest til Friday... Can't wait!
Hi Gemma,  I am struggling to find how much of what you used, Next time(if you can)plz write amount of ingredients  in comments   Also, plz send link where u wrote ingredients 😊😊😊😊😊
What did you mean by 'twelve minutes only’? Do I put the dough in the oven first, then count for 12 minutes since I turned the oven on? Or do I preheat the oven first then I count for 12 minutes after I put my dough in the oven?
Hello Gemma I tried your recipe and everyone loved it,but the cookies taste a little too sweet.How can I adjust the measurement of the sugar?Thank you!
Please tell the measurements..
"chunkage"!!! I love it!
Can I use a mix of bread flour and cake flour like another recipe? I ran out of all purpose flour 😅
How could I reduce the sugar to make them less sweeter? Thank you
Will the whole cookie be crispy if I bake it for more than 12 minutes??
Hello it's an amazing recipe. Please tell me where will I find the written ingredients with the measurements? I want it just like you had that brownie recipe picture of your website in the middle of your video.
I've read your stovetop cookies tips, but since you melt the butter in this recipe and it's not at room temperature, can I still make these on the stovetop?
This cookies I try already so yummy thank maam gemma
My cookies tend to be hard when they cool down. How and why do they turn out like this if they're soft and chewy when they're warm? And any ideas on how to fix that?
How many cookies can it make???
Can I brown the butter???
How long it can be stored and how to be stored?
How?!? These came out delicious ! Aesthetically though the one you make in the video look way better. It’s a bit buttery, still delicious, will make these again for sure
My cookies are well cooked from centre but raw at the edges. What could be the problem and how should I solve this. This happens everytime I bake cookies.
Hi Can I use salted butter instead of unsalted butter and don't add salt. Will it be OK? Thanks
I baked these yesterday and they were a super hit! One of the best cookie recipes I've tried. Super easy too, since no creaming of butter and sugar is needed! I reduced the sugar slightly and had only 250g of chocolate chips, but they were perfect. Next time I'll try adding some chopped toasted pecans....maybe some butterscotch chips too....I'm drooling already! Thanks a ton Gemma for all your wonderful recipes and your super clear instructions. Bless you♥️
What is the ratio/size of your scooper?
Just made these and they are PERFECT! Thank you so much!
How long can I leave my cookie dough to age in the fridge
I love baking  Thanks for your recipe
Your videos are without proper receipes plz mention quantity of every ingredient
Plz share the ingredients with quantity
Do you use dark chocolate or milk? Also, is bicarbonate of soda the same as baking soda?
Favourite YouTuber
I found this by searching  hwo make cookie big bold bak
what about the measurements?
How do you store them?
hello, what to substitute butter with?
I made a nice big batch of these....baked some and refrigerated some just to see the difference and I would definitely recommend refrigerating before baking them......it’s hard to not bake and eat the cookies immediately, but persevere and you will be rewarded! Best chocolate chip cookies I’ve ever tried!
I tried this today. But something went very wrong. They were nice n fluffy in the oven. I baked them for 12 mins. They looked perfect, but when I took them out they went completely flat and tore up as I was trying to get them off of the parchment paper. I had the dough in the fridge for about an hour. Now its either one of 2 things or maybe both. I used veggie based margarine rather than real butter and two maybe I should have left the dough for 2 or more hours in the fridge? I live in the tropics. Please help Gemma :(
Love from morocco,thank you ,i love it ❤
Hi Gemma! Is this cookie dough edible? I would really want to make an edible cookie dough out of this recipe because it’s really tasty, however this recipe contains raw ingredients, so is there any possible way to turn it into edible cookie dough?
omg you are such a wonderful baker
I've just baked these cookies and they turned out AMAZING!!! Of course, not as good-looking as Gemma's, but anyway very tasty and soft inside :) I would recommend everyone to put twice less sugar, about 200 gramms are more than enough, and 200 gramms of chocolate are enough as well. Thank you so much, Gemma!!! ❤️❤️❤️
Made them today my children and husband loved them so much thanks alot
Don't forget to get the written ingredients from her website, and read about making brown sugar on her website, and egg substitute on her website, add a rating on her website, she has a series on her website. And if you don't know how to find it, there's a pop-up for her website. And share.
I love your recipes and the way of presentation 😍😍😍 lemon cake recipe plz 😎👍
It looks yummy  Thank you 😊
We will be baking this 4th grading period so im watching this tutorial on how to make cookies..
My name is Gemma too😂
Hi,I just made the cookies.But I found it a little bit too sweet.what can I do with the remaining cookie dough to reduce the sweetness??
can i use chocolate powder instead of cocoa?
Why not Baking Powder? And what happens if you add cornstarch? I just want a clear explanation.
It’s soooo delicious the best cookies 🍪 ever
I have 'no added sugar' friends and wondered if you have a suggestion for making these cookies with a sugar substitute.
Can I use oil instead of butter if yes how much.
The dough is in the fridge right now. I'll share the photos with you when I bake! But I have a question.I followed everything. Your dough looks  messy. But mine's so smooth. (I didn't mix it up too much) does that lead to a problem?
1.flour 2. One egg 3. Baking soda 4. Salt 5. Cold Salted butter - melt 6. Chocolate chip cookies  7. White and brown sugar
She said chunckage
can we make this in amicrowave also?!
Ok I was going to wait until next week but...... couldn’t resist! I baked them after 3 hours in the fridge. Let me tell you...I love them!!!!!!!!!!! Brought back memories from school. I never liked soft cookies nor hard cookies. I loved somewhere in between. Crispy on the outside and chewy in the center. I found a winner!!! Thanks for the recipe.
I’m doing these cookies today. I’ll bake them next week. I’ll be adding half bitter sweet and half milk chocolate. Thank you.
can i bake in microwave ?
How much do we have to preheat our oven for
Gemma,, Ingredients measurement n grams Plz.. Reply ASAP, I'm gonna bake tom.
Hai from Rajafo Channel.. Love your receipe👍❤
Hello Gemma i just want to inquire what if someone doesn't have an oven can one use the microwave instead or what do you recommend please?
So I put the Dough in the Fridge for an Hour and baked so many. Then I left the left over dough in the Fridge for a few days, then went and rolled them into individual sized balls then froze them. How long will they last Frozen? And can I Bake them from frozen? And if so for how long for? I also used self raising flour instead of normal. The balls in the Freezer are squishy, is that normal too? Thank you!
Love it amazing
Can these be made with whole wheat flour? I tried with all purpose and it was awesome.
Hi gemma! This recipe looks so good and i need to ask: what if i only have the normal dark sugar instead of light brown sugar? Can i still use my dark brown sugar or nah? Also merry christmas!
can you use margarine instead of butter (sama measurement)? and what's diff between melting the butter and soften the butter
Best chocolate chip cookie recipe I’ve encountered. It really lives up to its name. Follow her recipe step by step and her tips and you will get cookies like how Gemma demonstrates in this video. Thank you Gemma!
I don’t know why u don’t   post measurements I come here so It’s easy not to go on to a blog  what’s the point if I’m watching this
Hi Gemma, can i minus the salt? Or no salt at all?
i made it today... it tastes rili good but why is it my cookies didnt turn as beautiful as urs? i followed everything u mentioned.  but why is it my cookies burned at the hottom but its fine on top? I preheated my oven for 10mins for 180-90c.... and bake it for 10mins... it didnt spread  and flatten  like that.... what did i do wrong? :(
I just made this cookie, I followed step by step but it seems to be too sweet is there anything I can do to dave the doigh in the fridge?
It is great that in this recipe the butter is used melted, it is always a huge pita to beat the butter until fluffy as required in most CCC recipes. Will definitely try.
I have a question here, since these kind of cookies that are big and gooey in the middle isn't really a big thing in my country so I cant really tell if I'm doing it right or not. How can I tell if the middle of the cookie is good enough that it's "gooey" or is it "still raw"?
Am I supposed to keep it in the fridge for 4-5 days or just leave it out ?
Shall be trying this recipe for a 2nd time but this time using my new kitchenaid gadget 😊
Truly the best chocolate chip cookies. Love em!!! Do you use salted or unsalted butter? Thanks
Mine didn't go so well.it was very hard.
Do u HAVE to use chocolade Cuz i don’t have that at Home aha.
Hi Gemma! I'm a twelve year old Baker and I love all your recipes!  I tried two other recipes for chocolate chip cookies but they didn't turn out right  but when i tried these,they were soooo Good 🤤!! Thank you for sharing your recipe !! 😊
Hi goodevening just tried this today but the outcome of my cookie shape is not good I just follow the steps that you're doing. Please help. Thank you
Hi, Gemma. I have made some of your recipes and they are all great. Especially the brownies,  my friends and family loves it so much. I have been meaning to try your cookie recipe. I have my own cookie recipe that I am using but recently I noticed some time the cookie stays soft after a few days and some other time it gets hard and crunchy. Oftentimes the cookie gets hard after a few days if the dough I am using has been aged in the freezer for a few days. Will this recipe keep the cookie soft and chewy after several days?
Hi ma'am how to make egg less ??
Followed everything til the dot. Turned out flat. Pft.
I've tried this recipe. and OMG!!! it's super delicious!!! my family liked it sooo much. 😊😊 thank you Gemma for your fantastic recipes. all of your recipes are beyond amazing. thank you for sharing ❤️
are you supposed to just put the dough in the fridge or the freezer where you have your frozen foods?
Hi Miss Gemma i just want to ask what can i use to preserve the cookies for like 3weeks?
My cookies don't go flat as yours, but keeps a belly
ممكن المقادير بالعربية
Please help me out! I followed this recipe to the “t” and mines turned out like bread! 😭 I don’t know what went wrong

hi i have a question.. after bake the cookies, how to store it so i can still enjoy it for like another 2-3 days.. can i store it in a close container?.. will it still be soft and chewy after 2-3 days?
I have tried many times to make cookies, but I don't why it turn out be in cake, I follow recipe perfectly can you please tell me what is the reason?
Can done via microwave oven？
You are a gem... I tried these cookies out today and this is the ultimate chocolate chip cookies 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍 jeez... This can never go wrong
I agree with your comment about letting your dough sit in frig...that does intensify the flavors...got to have the browned butter ...chewy great texture...your look a little too brown...like 'crispy' ....
I appreciate your effort but trust me the best ever chocolate chip cookie...you absolutely have to use Brown Butter....it really brings out the flavor makes the best chocolate chip cookie you will ever ....ever have....
Are u using compound chocolates
Hi   Can you please help me I made these chocolate chip biscuits now but it's not soft  In the microwave they rise then it sat down ! It taste like crackers not like soft chocolate chip cookies  What should I do?
Can we use compound chocolate chunks
How much Cocoa powder  should i add to this recipe to make it double chocolate  chip cookies? Please let me know and also how can i make  it even flatter?  -Veer
Hi, Gemma ❤️ I just made this recipe and I absolutely LOVED the turn out. It was my first time ever making cookies and they came out perfect thanks to your techniques. I played with the proportions of the ingredients a little bit. My brother rated my cookies a solid 7 out of 10 and he’s the pickiest eater I know. Thank you, Gemma ❤️
plz can you put the full recipe
Hi. I’m using convection oven and there are 3 options such as upper head, lower heat and both . Which one do I have to use for baking this cookie ?
this is my go-to cookie recipe!!! its amazing!!!
Does adding all the ingredients together make the cookies flat?  I put the dough in the fridge.🤔🤔
Another question....can i use baking powder if thats all i have? If so how much?
Hi Gemma? Could you i use any chocolate of my liking? E.g Milk choc?
If I make smaller portions how long should they be in the oven and at what temperature?
Do I need to preheat my oven for this recipe?
Gemma i love your recipes and this was my first ever cookie and it turned out absolutely delicious 😋
I made mine and it is delicious my niece and her classmates loved it.
I wonder if I can add a tablespoon or two of cornstarch so it will be crispier?  Thanks Gemma..love from the Philippines 😊
made these the other day and my hubby took these to work and they went out like hotcakes...i'm a believer, i have to make a another batch soon
What if I want Crispy all the way , should I cook it longer or put temp lower first   Thanks
I made those but they are extremely sweet. I added extra flour then it worked.😊
shouldn't we use baking powder instead? since it's heat activated
Just tried this recipe today and it completely blows everything else out of the water. The consistency was just perfect, better than Tasty’s version and so much easier.
I made these and they were so good!! I didn't have baking soda so I used your bold baking basics replacement. At first It puffed up so much and it's so soft and cakey..but after it cooled down it turns flat, crispy , and chewy. Also I used dark Chocolate chunks and the ratio of dough to chocolate is so good. Nice Job Gemma 👌
These were incredible!!  I didn't even get a chance to take a photo to post to your website before they were all gone.  Guess I'll have to make them again ;)
I made this and it turned out amazing. Chewy , soft and so chocolaty.  Loved it ♡
i dont know why but my chocolate chunks are melting in the dough as soon as i put them in i had to pop them in freezer still dont know how it will turn out
i used this video for a school project i'm in 7th grade
Where are the measurements??????
Can I use dark brown sugar instead of light brown sugar
Hey Jemma!Just got the dough ready. Will send you pic of the cookies
I had such hopes for this recipe  - followed it to the letter, and chilled the dough in the fridge overnight (12 hours)  -  they weren't even like pancakes when I baked them  - more like crepes,  with puddles of  delicious, chopped, chunks of 72% chocolate welding them to the parchment paper  -   the chocolate was the only tasty thing about them.  I would still have eaten them,  once I chipped them from the paper, but they tasted very weird - so are consigned to the bin.   :(    thanks for the recipe,  anyway -  another one bites the dust.   lol  xx
I envy your family. Your friends. Your neighbors. Basically, anyone who has access to your amazing creations. Oh, well. Such is life.
Can it be baked on a stove top
how many cookies does this recipe make?
Hi Gemma...made this and they came out really nice😊 Just wanted to ask is it possible to reduce the amount of sugar in these cookies?? Will it affect the cookies?? Thanks
Hey! Can I use dark compound instead of 72% cocoa chocolate?
And mine come out so flat
Why does my mix look so watery? And I’m doing exactly what she’s doing
Hi mam can we use melting the butter till it turn dark brown then use for cookies
Can please someone please tell me the measurement in grams..?
I used to bake these last year and they were delicious, now its been a couple times i try it it doesn’t give me any good results, first time they puffed to much and it was more like a muffin, this time they puffed less bas still they’re hard as rock and not chewy in the center, and they are thick they dont melt in the oven idk what im doing wrong 😭😭😭😭
Superb
Hi, can I use any flour?
Hello Gemma. Yo always say baking soda is activated by acidic liquid. Which you didnot use in this recipe with b.s.  How did it work then?
Im going to try this tomorrow
Should you use baking POWDER, not baking SODA?
The best chef ever
I literally just finished baking your brownies recipe and it's 3:22am here. It turned fantastic and so delicious mygosssh!!! Now that I'm watching your choco chip cookie recipe, I wanna make it again 😭 and yes just 30mins after baking your brownie and now i wanna try baking your cookie 😭 why are you doing this to us????? HAHAHA lol. Kidding aside. Thank you so much for sharing the best of all the bestest recipes! Love you gemma! 😘😘😘😘

"secret weapon"... brown sugar? 🤔
HELP GEMMA IF I MADE COOKIE DOUGH ALREADY AN COOKED 2 COOKIES AN THEY NOT CHEWY OR SOFT WHAT CAN I DO AT THIS POINT
I made this recipe so much times and it always turned out perfect! Thanks you so much Gemma also I subscribed💓

Hi  can you show me how to make a lasagna noodles
Can we use baking powder???
Can I make these in a convection oven?
They look delicious Gemma. Another must try  🍪👌
Hi!  Great recipe. I just wanted to know how many days these cookies will last once baked.  What's their shelf life? Please help. Thank you.
I made these and went bigger bolder by browning the butter AND using dark chocolate with sea salt for 1/3 of the chunks, regular dark for the rest. The dough was really hard this morning when I took it out of the fridge and had to wait a bit to be able to scoop it. But that's minor, they turned out FANTASTIC!! I baked a half dozen and I'm freezing the rest of the scoops for another time. I used my muffin scoop and got 27!! Thanks so much for this recipe!!! <3
My cookies turned flat🧐what cud be the reason. I followed whole process but still
Heyy gemma! Love this recipe, I want to make but is it fine if I put the cookies in paper instead of baking paper?
Hi Gemma! Can you share a recipe for lactation cookies? thanks!
Great recipe thanks, How about using a brown butter instead of normal cold butter? have you ever tried it?
I have a question.. If I want to prepare this using microwave, how much time is required to bake this in microwave??
Does the warm butter/sugar mixture not cook the eggs?
I made it last night but I used spelt flour instead of regular flour and I only used brown sugar. I left the dough in the fridge for almost 24 hours and the result are a delicious chocolate chip cookies 🍪 I'm so happy.
hey thanks for sharing this recipe. i've made chocolate chip cookies before, but after days the cookies was hardened. do u have any tips?
Would there be a difference if I used margarine instead of butter?
Internet recipes don't usually come out for me😓😫😫 .... Whyy
Well I'm making this right now...... Fingers crossed
I tried this jemma it came out well...yummy....thank you
How can I store the baked cookies? I have to gift it to my friend and I am sure he would take a week to eat 15 cookies.
Yay salted butter 👍😋😅
HI. Thanks for taking the time to make this video and sharing your recipe.  There is one thing I want to question though and it has to do with the sugar. I too put brown sugar in my chocolate chips cookies, but you said if someone does not have brown sugar then they can use white sugar. Using all white sugar and no brown sugar makes a totally different consistency cookie and they would not be the same.
Hey try dill  flan.. u ll loved it... seriously  it delicious
can i ask if ihave no baking soda what i used
I'm 11 and my mum tells me to study all the time but I love to bake I stopped for a while but when I saw this recipe I had to bake it !!

Subscribed, downloaded your video, ready to make it tomorrow :)

Hi gemma i used baking soda in the recipe and after i baked them all i tasted was bitter taste from the baking soda
I'm baking those cookies for the second time now, the first time I used melted butter and It was perfect, today I'm using room temperature butter. Love from Brazil Gemma, you are the best
just got an oven and the first thing I did was go to YouTube and search "Gemma's cookies" and watched all of the recipes and I can't wait to try this one out!! I got an oven only to make gemmas creations
I tried this today omg it’s da best I ever made this would me my perfect recipe for chocolate chip cookies. Thank you very much 😍😘
They look amazingly tasty 😋 @BiggerBolderBaking . One question what type of flour did you use please ?? Tia ❤️🙏🏻
Oh my gosh!!!!! My bf made these and they are soooooo chewy good!!!! I love it! These are the best cookies ever. I love watching your videos. They are so easy to follow and inspiring. Thank you Gemma!
Hi Gemma, I personally don't like to use plain flour. Can I replace it with wheat flour instead? If yes, what is your advice on the change in measurements?
Wow. Just how cookies is supposed to be made it is art. I haven’t made them yet but the techniques and finesse is the best. Gemma can you make a cannoli recipe video?
Lovely
How can I replace the egg ? To make an eggless cookie ? I did check your egg substitute list... it says flax seed powder or condensed milk. Can either be used or just the latter? Thank you
How to make them crispy?
I've tried this recipe those cookies was just mind blowing . So soft and very tasteful . Love this recipe and recommend to all youtube users
If you don't have salted butter can u just add some salt
What is the difference between baking soda and baking powder in cookie making?
My chocolate chip cookies came out too soft I want crisp now what to do
Wow... i made these today and they tasted brilliant....
Hi.. can someone tell me if I have to adjust the temperature if I'm making smaller sized cookies?  What will be the temperature if I'm using a gas oven?
What’s the best way to store the cookies if they aren’t all consumed in one day and how long can they last? :)
Hi if im replacing egg with condensed milk wont the cookie become extra sweet as it has white and brown sugar already? Also can i replace white sugar also with condensed milk?
I made a batch of this recipe my cookies were fantastic. But I made them the second time and they never raised and were cake like
I made your brownies! Everyone loved it! ❤️ 😊 Also the bannana cake. Now I'll try your chocolate chip cookies.   When I try your recipes I always never fail, even in first try!  Credits❤️
First time I come back to give a thumbs up to a recipe I tried, it was so easy to make and it came out great but I made a little adjustment to it by adding a table spoon of corn starch
Hi, When mixing my sugar & butter it seemed too wet. Then when adding the eggs (1 at a time), & vanilla, I did not get that “press with your finger to leave a print a feel that just shy of play-doe texture”. What I got was a sticky, almost curdled consistency. What do you think I did wrong? I followed the recipe exactly , I used my microwave to SOFTEN my butter and I soaked my eggs to become room temp. Thank you.
Can it be 10 or 9 mins for crispy outside chewy inside??
This is my favorite cookies recipe but i made them yesterday as i make them usually and they didnt turn out as good as usual, they were too cakey and I don't understand what happened 🤔
i tried that recipe out but the cookies were soft as if a cake but I still really like it .THANKS ALOT 😚😚.
ohhh faith and be gorra
is it okay if i used less butter? 3/4 cup instead of 1 because it looks too much for me
Trying these out for the first time! They’re chilling in the fridge right now & I’m so excited 😋
Preparing this just now. Chilling in fridge hopefully turn out good. Have tried the best ever brownies and not disappointed at all
Please make best-ever cheese cake recipe.
Gemma your recipes are really great and does not require anything that is not available in india. Thank you for this recipe too. One question though: I do not like soft centred cookies. If I bake it for about 15 minutes will it spoil the taste?
delicious Cookies
Very sweet cookies..... Too much sugar..!
Hello Gemma,   This is Somrita, from India. I've just started baking and I tried this recipe. Though I had halved the sizes of the dough ball, the recipe was just as effective. Everybody loved it!   Thank you for creating such wonderful recipes, in your videos I can feel such a genuine care with the way you show us how its done. Wish we had more teachers like you!
These are INCREDIBLE! It is a family favorite. Take Gemma's recommendation to leave it in the fridge for a few days. It makes a difference. We also rolled these into logs and froze them. When we wanted cookies, we just sliced them into rounds.
I wish i could have an oven.  I really want to bake.  I always watch ur videos.  And makes me so addictive all of ur videos.  But i couldnt even afford to buy oven..
Do you cover the dough when you put it in to the fridge??
My cookies remain as cute little balls... somebody knows why?
Hi plz write ingredients  with their quantity
I tried it last week but I missread it. I thought it’s just my regular palm brown sugar, turn out it’s light brown sugar. So my dough became too dark 😂😂😂 But the result still is amazing, thou! 😘❤️
Why do you put the measurements of your recipes on your website that is Soo annoying!!!! you could just tell the measurements for your recipe as you tell us the method😒
Hi,Gemma.do you have any tips on how to make cookies from Levain bakery? Thank you
Hii Gemma amazing recipe thanks Baking soda leaves a weird chemical like taste can we omit it and I have that small electric oven so should I leave top n bottom both lights on or one
Is it ok if my dough is so sticky???
Thank you
Hi Gemma These look good. But aren’t we supposed to cream room temperature butter and sugars together? Guess I’ll have to bake them and see for myself ;)
I have a question, I always make this recipe and it comes out lovely. I tried doubling the recipe and it came out harder on the inside not moist . What did I do wrong?
Hi Gemma, I did it and my husbend can't stop putting his hands in the cookie jar...Thank you!
Hola Gemma! me encantan tus recetas, especialmente las de Crazy dough, pero me gustaría solicitarte una receta para hacer galletas con chispas con aceite vegetal ( sin mantequilla). He visto esa receta, pero lleva una harina preparada de caja (cake mix) y como eres experta en masas, pensé que podrías hacerlo más fácil. Gracias anticipadas
I did it. It tasted awesome. The only problem I had (not the first time I'm making cookies) is that they did not spread and flat. But it was still chewy, soft and delisious.
I followed your recipe and used Lindt chocolate but I made them a bit too big and they came out the size of pizza pockets. I made a good mistake they were marvelous. I’ll do it again soon
Okay, I'm going to bake it RIGHT NOW 😋
Hi Gemma! I’ve tried making your cookies 3 times now and they always spread flat even when I put them in the fridge for 2 hours. I follow your recipe every time. What can I do?
Hi gemma. How do you add cocoa powder to make it double chocolate cookie? Thanks!
Thank you thank you thank you for this wonderful simple  chocolate chip cookie recipe it was such a hit in my home and I think this is going to be one of my best keep of all time recipes...
I have read and tried numerous 'best chocolate chip cookie recipes' and by just reading it, i can be sure that it's going to be my favorite, i hope it turns out as I imagine. I use gas oven, and is there anything I would do differently than your original recipe, like changing the temperature  or time?
I always end up burning my cookies:/
I just made these and they are sooooooooooo nice
Is it 1/2 stick of butter?
I’m gonna try this recipe....those cookies look awesome... Gemma I will let u know the outcome..... great video
thot this said "grandma's best ever chocolate chip cookies" lmao
Hey Gemma I prefer crispy cookies over chewy ones so can I skip the refrigeration?
GEMMA YOU ARE THE BEST!
Hey Gemma.  I made your Chocolate Chip cookies last night.  Not only was it a hit at home,  but I brought them to my church today for a dinner and they were a hit there as well. Those cookes just disappeared quickly.  They were so good! Thank you for the recipe my friend! 😁😋🍫
I made these with oil instead of butter and they turned out really good.Now I need more.
God bless you lady
I’ve tried a lot of recipes including the viral one from Tasty and this one blows all other recipes out of the water. Also not nearly as complicated as the Tasty video. Thank you!
Hi Gemma, saw your page on Anne Reardons How to cook that page. So came for a look and subbed.
Watching this as I just put away two batches of cookie dough in the fridge :) one chocolate chip vanilla with nuts and dried bananas, one vanilla chocolate chip with chopped nuts and peanut butter. I guess I'll bake them tomorrow, see how the difference will be! 😍
Does white sugar work the same as the brown one ??? I'm a beginner
Hi Gemma I followed the recipe and the batter was as u showed in the video but who baking in a GAS OVEN the cookies were burnt from bottom and uncooked . How should I bake it ? At what temperature and for how much time ?
These cookies had the perfect softness! I just found them a little sweet for my taste, next time I will try them with less sugar and see how they turn out.
It’s the same recipe as “tasty”
I just made these and they turned out amazing!! And I used white sugar only as I didn’t have any brown!
Hi gemma! How r u? I need your help.. I follow this recipe nd open bottom heat after few minutes my cookies started burning from buttom and uncooked from top.. How can i bake it evenly?
Made these and by God do they spread out!   Watch the timing!
Hi Gemma. Very nice recipe. My oven is not working. Is it possible to bake them in the microwave pls
U are just amazing. Your recpies just  turn out amazing too
I like all your recipes that always use SALTED Butter !! The taste is so rich. Thanks !
do I need to grease the parchment paper?
I made this recipe but for some reason the batter turned out much more liquidy that hers. Could I be that I put too much butter in? I followed all the ingredients and steps correctly though
I can definitely attest for this recipe. This is the only chocolate chip cookie recipe, I use anymore, for years now. Its perfect! ❤️
I have them eggless it's yummy thanks alot for sharing this amazing recipe
I made this recipe and I'd definitely say these are the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever tasted in my entire life!! So delicious! Your best-ever brownies were also to DIE for. Good job, Gemma.
Amazing amazing amazing
Hi .. after refrigerating do I need to get it back to room temperature before baking.
I don’t know how much you add ???
Hi ms. Gemma i've tried and it is so chewy!😍 can i lessen the sugar if it is too sweet for my prefernce? Thank you!😊
I'm really confused abt this, a video I watched used milk and one egg, urs is just two eggs and no milk which is preferable 😭
Hi , very nice to c and I am going to try this tomm —can u pls tell us the quantity of the ingredients-
How do I make it all crispy without the gooey center?
Thank you for your recipe. I just have one question for you please? What size scoop did you use to make your balls of dough? I bake with measurements and that step was crucial for me. Can you tell me if it was a 1/4 cup sized scoop please or if the dough ball was equivalent to "X" amount of tablespoons please? Or the weight of each ball of dough? With thanks.
Can you use skittles instead of chocolate or chocolate bars.
Is it ok if I add vegetable oil instead of butter?
Gemma please help .. i made this recipe twice and it taste heaven but the cookies get hard after setting outside the oven half an hour  What should i do to keep it soft and chewy for longer time?
Can i make this cookies without buttet?
???? tell me is it maida flour gemma
is it maida
hello answer me gemma.....
which flour should we add gemma stafford??
Hi Gemma !!! If I don't want a chewy centre but a crispy one , for how many minutes more would I  have to bake them ???
so nice i love it
Any chance you know what the calories of each cookie is? They are soooo tasty!
preheat temperature.?
I have made this one several weeks ago and I still had some in refrigerator. This cake is very simple and you can put it and bake it every time you want and need. Thank you Gemma!
Can I use oil instead of butter?
Thanx
How long can a cookie dough can be refrigerated, maximum days??
whenever i make ur recipes they fail i wonder why
I wonder why after out from the fridge my dough melt when it’s inside d oven? Then I add more flour again into my dough at last it works but the taste like sugar..I use light brown sugar as in d recipe
Uhhh this is a normal cookie recipe?
can someone share me a crunchy chocolate chip cookie recipe?
Gemma, do you pack down your brown sugar and flour? Thank you!
I made these cookies and followed the recipe just as told. My cookies were yum and there were lovely cracks and everything on the top but the cookies didn't flatten out like they should have and instead became puffy. Yes i refrigerated and yes i added baking soda and not powder. Then i tried another batch without refrigeration and this batch turned out to be perfect. My conclusion: refrigeration or aging of dough did not work out well for me :/  Gemma if you read this kindly give your expert advice.
Can you tell about the difference between using melted butter and using temperature room butter?  If i want a crispy egde and soft inside. What should i do? My cookies came out so soft and broke easily, can you help me please Thank you
I made this twice already and everyone loved the cookies!! Thanks Gemma!!
Gemma I used baking powder instead of soda. How can it be rectified.
Why my cookies did not spread.....please guide
Hi, Gemma! I've been a silent watcher of yours for quite some time now. I just have to ask though, can I do this recipe in an oven toaster?  It's because I recently bought and made an instant chocolate chip cookie in a toaster, and it turned out well. But, like what if it's now homemade, will it turn out the same? So, yeah! Hope you respond!  Thank you & I love your videos!
Hi, In my country, butter is a bit more expensive, but we get a wide range of margarine for a reasonable price. Would the margarine affect the taste of the cookie in a major way?
Can we add oil instead of butter.?
Forget BuzzFeed tasty's 'worlds best cookies'. This is hands down the best recipe - haven't tried it though 😁
Hi Gemma ,why is it not possible to mention the measures of ingredients along with your baking  ? It would be time saving.  Love your recipes & you
i've been looking all over for the chocolate chip cookie and yours is the best, easy to follow and the final result looks exactly what i have in mind, i'm gonna try it soon. but one quick question,  the chocolate bar that you use, is it only for baking or can i use the regular chocolate bar like hershey's or those that you can eat right out of the package. thanks :)
I've made these babies Gemma, I love the texture and the taste 😍😍😍 I didn't use chocolate bar because I only have chocolate chip in my pantry. One thing bother me is, mine don't have the professional,  pretty soft crack and wrinkles on the surface like yours, it's too smooth I don't like that 😔, how to fix it?
hi gemma i mistakenly added 1and half tbsp of salt what should i do?
Why on earth did I watch this while dieting?!?! I think I am now forced to break my diet yet again...lol! Seriously though, those looked amazing!!! I always use salted butter as well! :)
Hi.baking means only down road or up rod also?
So i like every of your recipes and this is one of the best
What if we want to make crunchy cookies?
BEST EVER CHOCOLATE CHIP WALNUT COOKIES:In Large bowl add 2 1/2C.All Purpose Flour,1 teaspoon Baking Powder double acting if you don't have just add an extra teaspoon,Sprinkle in Cinnamon about 1/2Tablespoon & 1/8 teaspoon Nutmeg whisk all together set aside.In Medium Pot add 2 Sticks Unsalted Butter,1/2C.Brown Sugar,2 Tablespoons Molasses you don't have to but I think it makes them chewy & delicious,1/2C.Miniature Marshmellows,1/2C.Granulated Sugar,Pinch or sprinkle in salt.You can also add for heat Red Chili Flakes about 1/2 teaspoon or omit.Cook on medium heat til all melted should look like medium dark caramel sauce,whisk a little.Take off heat & temper with 2 Eggs.Add this to your dry ingredients & mix with a spatula.Place in fridge to cool for 1 1/2 hours or so til cooled so you can add the morsels.Take out now add 1/2C.Mini Semi Sweet Morsels,& 1/2C.Finely chopped Walnuts.Mix til combined.If you add to the dough it all will melt together unless you don't mind that you can.Line a cookie sheet with non stick aluminum foil if you don't have this then spray with butter spray a little.Take 1 teaspoon of the cookie dough roll in hands & mash til looks like 1/2 dollar size.Bake 350 for 12-15 minutes til looks done b/c ovens do vary.Take out allow to cool about 1-2 minutes then place in a Large rectangle dish or cooling rack or your preferred cookie container.These are the best cookies I have ever tasted.Not too sickening sweet just right to me.If you feel their not sweet enough you can always add melted chocolate but I feel their really good & w/o the extra calories.I had three & dang it I'm on a diet.Ps.The reason why I melted the sugar with the butter is so it all gets incorporated better.
I started to love her recipes since I made the best ever cinnamon followed by best ever brownies😍😍😍 and now  I made this lovely and delicious cookies 😍😋 worth trying👍👍👍 I want to upload the photo of my cookies on her bigger bolder website but it says internal server error 😔 hope they fix it,,,the first photo that I uploaded was her best ever brownies 😋they sent me mail that the photo has been uploaded 😇 thank you so much.. Godbless  More power❤️
Is this cookie chewy or soft in the middle?
Do we need to pre-heat the oven?
Thanks Gemma for this beautiful recipe. I tried it out and they came out really lovely plus my kids loved them. I felt i had to give you all credits. Thanks once again.
Just what I needed, my husband was complaining about the amount of chocolate in my baking drawer.  I think he should make these since he was so concerned😉
I made them today...kept in fridge for chilling..fingers crossed
Hi Gemma, I know you said these cookies are best served while warm...Can you freeze these cookies, and warm them in the oven before serving? Love your channel!!
Gemma Stafford Hi gemma, I baked the cookies by your recipe. But then after baking they become very thin. But are little soft in the centre. I wanted some thick cookies. Any advice on that?
Gemma i tried them but had some issues: 1)the salt and vanilla essence didnot got mixed up well. 2)they got burnt even after baking them for exactly 13 mins. Please tell me a good solution
Yess i have made this cookies more than 10 times and are super delicious and yummmmyyy !!!  U are my inspiration ♥♥ I too want to become a pastry chef and really want to start a YouTube channel soon 😘
This is so basic
Why don’t you just brown to butter ? If you’re gunna melt it anyway then why not ?
I tried tasty's, I tried mrs. Fields, Jaqces Torres', anna olsen's, nestle toll house and many more different recipes but I always go back to yours. Whenever i tried a diff recipe, my kids would always tell me to make "my original"  recipe instead (wc is yours actually) 😁 we super love this. Thanks so much for sharing
Is it possible to replace white sugar for stevia sugar? If so, would the taste be too different?
Love you Gemma for this recipe... I used so many substitutes. A convection microwave in place of an oven. Condensed milk in place of eggs. Also I added some almonds in there. And guess what the cookies turned out lovely. Cooling the dough really works. I's raining outside now. Can't get any better time to enjoy these. Thank you so much for this recipe.
Mines were too salty (between the salt and the baking soda) I didn’t melt the butter and I used a butter substitute-does that matter? They came out flat (which is what I didn’t want 🙄) and somewhat crispy. I did use self-rising flour because I had so much of it and some left over possibly all purpose. I didn’t cook all the dough so maybe I can get a better result with it. Cooking for 12 minutes in an electric oven at 375 would be too long, I cooked at 350 for 10 minutes so they wouldn’t be hardly crispy and they still were more crisp than I wanted!
I need those measuring cups.
Can we use oil instead of butter
not a hater love your channel and I am subscribed too watch most of ur  videos andd tried some too.x
sorry to say to say but the cookies had a strong taste of baking soda by following this recipe. i might add baking powder next time
This is really the best chocolate chip cookies recipes I ever tried! After having tried many chefs recipes that ended up with cookies that were too cakey or too thin I found your amazing recipe, that even suits French ingredients like the « President » butter or the eggs... and gives Gorgeous American style Cookies !!!! I’m obsessed with this recipe !!! Thank you 🤩
The best cookies ever!!!
Hi Gemma! I made these last week and they were absolutely perfect! Thank you for this amazing recipe, I highly recommend it, they were chewy in the middle and crunchy on the outside!
Dear Gemma, I was baking for the first time ever and made this for my family, thank God because your recipes, it made me look like pro baker 😄😁 and everyone loves this!! Thank you for sharing!
Hi gemma ...kindly tell proper quantity measurements of things used
can I mix everything in a stand mixer? or this is the best way?
I made a half batch a few days ago and it made 8 cookies that were 1/4 cup of dough each. Though I did have to bake it for like, 20 mins because every oven is different. They tasted delicious 👌💖😍
Hi Gemma.. So I tried making cookies for the first time using your recipe. I did everything as mentioned.. But still they have turned out very cakey. They are so soft and cake like I don't know what to do. Please help

hy gemma my batter is so loose consistency before chilling...is it okay for cookies or is there anything i can do to make it good
Hey Gemma I really loved this recipe, so I  prepared the  dough to make these wonderful cookies But just as I was about to make them my oven went wrong and getting it repaired might take time, I have frozen them for the time being Is it possible to make them in the microwave by any chance? Thanks
Hi Gemma, if I use condensed milk instead of egg, Doyon do I adjust sugar since condensed milk is sweet. Please help. I love watching and making your recipes. I do not eat egg so make adjustments.
Hmm I followed the recipe exactly but they spread out in the oven. Still delicious though.
tried this and they were so easy to make and very delicous!
What is the substitute of butter? And how much ?
Hi Gemma I've tried couple of your recipes and they turned out gr8 😍 can I use half of ingredients for smaller batch ?
I added condensed milk instead of eggs but my dough is quiet dry....  Can u plz help what should I do
Hey GEMMA, if i use salted butter, then do i need to add salt again to the dough? I'm planning on making these cookies tomorrow!!!! thanks in advance! <3
I subscribed
Hello, Gemma.  How r u?   I really love ur shows those r quick n easy  n no hidden at all.  I did bake the chocolate cookies they tuned out yum yummy.  I just adjusted a bit of sugar for my taste n that's it.  I have the same question like u  "why do the recipes of cookies, muffins, breads ... change a lots I cannot remember?"  Then i found ur website.  I just want something simple n fast to bake for my kids to enjoy.    My family love them (what I baked) that meant they love ur shows also.  Thanks👍❤😊

Beautiful Cookies Gemma Greetings from Ireland
Instead of butter can I use oil???
Hi Gemma, needing to bake this for a bunch of people at work. Was just wondering, if i double the ingredients will that mess up the recipe.
how can I calibrate the temperature n timings in case of microwave oven...can u please help me out with this!!!! ☺
Is there a difference between using softened butter and melted butter?
HI GEMMA,  i' m from Kazakhstan Almaty, country in Central Asia. I love your channel a lot!!!!! I want to try almost all your recipes, they are  clear, strait to the point and  good looking as well 😍 Here in  my country we  love to drink a lot of tea with something sweet and delicious....  I decided to bake your chocolate cookie today🍪 I want to thank you for this recipe I've been searching for it for a long time. ... Cookies turned out soft and chewy, exactly how I wanted. Unfortunately there is no brown sugar  in our region, I substituted with a white and I've put less amount of it than in the recipe, because we prefer less sweetness in pastries we bake ... Oh, and I  have to say, here in Kazakhstan we have very good quality of dark chocolate 🍫 Gemma and please welcome to Kazakhstan, whenever you decide to travel to Central Asia! I'm sure you will like culture, people and of course world of food. Our dishes and deserts are very delicious with eastern twist and uniqueness!  Best wishes to you, Marsia
Hi Gemma! I got a chocolate chip cookie craving about an hour and a half ago and your recipe was the first one I thought of! Oh my goodness!!! So easy to make and they are so delicious! I just LOVE the crispy edges and the fudgy center! This will be my go to recipe from now on! Thank you so much for sharing it!☺️
This look so good, OMG, I'm drooling!
I made it in microwave...Very delicious bt not baked properly frm back side...
I forgot to add the salt... Does that ruin the way they'll taste?
Hi Gemma when making my dough it’s very soft... n I have followed ur recipe exactly as u wrote it... can u please advise?
i made this and  1. you HAVE TO put this in a fridge before baking it 2. take it out of the oven when you see the cookies turning brownish around the sides 3. it would be SUPER SOFT as if it’s not cooked when you take it out but let it rest for like 5 minutes and you will get a chewy and perfectly cooked cookie
i tried this recipe and it was SO liquidy even when i put in 1/8 cup of extra flour. However, in the website it did say that it would be like this. So I chilled the dough in the fridge and in 30 minutes it is PERFECT. I am still letting it chill just in case but you should definitely try this recipe!!! Even a novice like me could do it 😂
I replaced the eggs with flax seeds but dough is grainy and dry. The cookies are hard. I tried the same  recipe with eggs and I got them perfect. How should I replace egg to get same texture?
Thanku! Can i use oil instead of butter?
I used 1/4th of the recipe with flax egg as an egg substitute, it made 6 cookies. I also added cocoa powder.. It turned out to be really great!! Thanks!
hi gemma.. how long is the shelf life of the cookie when already baked?
Hi Gemma, I've been a following your videos for a while now. Thanks for the great content and the yummy recipes. I want to make your cookie recipe but i want to reduce the amount of sugar, 400grs without counting the chocolate is waaaay too sweet for me. But I know in baking cooking the ratios between white sugar, brown sugar and butter is important. Any tips ?
Thanks a ton Gemma. I made cookies from your recipe and they’re out of the world. My family loved them. 😊
Where do you have these gorgeous glas bowls from?  Greetings from Germany 😊
Who the fuck dislikes a chocolate chip cookie recipe?!
what chocolate do u use can u use the bar chocolates for cooking or is ready choc?
Hi, Gemma ❤ I have tried tens of your recipes and all turned out perfectly. Even this cookie recipe is my ultimate one everyone loves it, but when I tried to freeze the dough the cookies turned toooooo soft losing its crispiness as if am eating bread, Could you tell me what may be wrong?
I tried these today. They’re amazing!! I definitely recommend u try these recipe! Thanks Gemma 😁
I tried it. But my dough was a bit wetter
Hi Gemma! I baked the cookies as per instructions but somehow my cookies turned cakey in consistency. They are very delicious though 😀. I did sift my flour because of the lumps but I don’t know if it contributed  to it. I also used the fanbake setting of my mini oven at 190 C. Hope you could help me out. Thank you!
Hi Gemma again ?Saw the the way you made chocolate chip cookies.brilliant.Instead of putting eggs can I put apple sauce in it.
Hi gemma, I want to have more amount of servings, do I just use the recipe x2
I wanted to come back and say that I have made this recipe twice and it is AMAZING. Truly, the best chocolate chip cookies ever. If you follow the instructions, they really do turn out exactly like Gemma says they will. Make sure you eat them warm. They are still delicious once they've cooled, but then they taste like a grocery store bakery cookie.
Just tried best ever cookies ....they lost their shape although I chilled for an hour,just dap some water on hands to reduce stickiness....
Made this yesterday! Forgot to buy some eggs so I replaced them with condensed milk and a little water. I baked them in a halogen oven but they came out crispy 😂😅 probably the heat are a little too strong but overall I did well on my first try! Thank you Gemma for this recipe! My friends said it was delicious! 😋 The house even smelt like chocolate chip cookies the whole day too hahaha
Can i use *pink salt*??
i love LOVE love her!!! She takes the worry out of baking!!! I made this dough last night but too tired to stay up any later and put the bowl in the fridge... I didn't hear the part when she said you CAN leave it in there.. SHE GIVES SO MANY GREAT TIPS! THANK YOU GEMMA!
Hi Gemma, may i know the chocolate chunk u mix into the cookie dough also 72%?   Also, due to the chocolate chunk or chip in Malaysia often didnt stated the percentage of the cocoa, i only can try one by one and often feel its still sweeter.  Can i reduce the sugar that mix into cookie dough? Both white and brown sugar? If reduce, does it change the texture?  Any better advice for me? Thank you dear
I remember using this   recipe in last 2 week lab in my my family consumer class. It tasted delicious
My cookies was puffed when I put it in oven, I don't know why I , and not so crunchy , i use baking soda only and salt n white sugar. I want to know .
I dont understand why you say if we freeze they dont spread,but they do
Gemma you are a very generous person
Dear Gemma, I've tested this recipe and it turned out great! . Thank you for sharing us concise and precious recipes! I really enjoy watching your videos as if I am sitting in a very good class and I appreciate it so much! Thank you. :)
Gemma ,  Indeed best ever  choco chip cookies . I tried it out and they taste yummm. But turned out  very much  sweet , I followed  every  dot of your   recipe
Why did my cookies turn out so damn hard? Like it was difficult to even bite into it
How can I make this eggless?
I made these and this is really an awesome recipe!  My family enjoyed it so much and the salt was really key. Thanks for this Gemma !
Hi mam... In your egg substitute link you gave given 4 tablespoon of condensed milk for cookies.  In this cookie receipe two eggs are used.  So if I use 8 tablespoon of condensed milk, should I reduce the sugar...white and brown both...pls reply mam
Hi Gemma. I've used this recipe many times and it turned out great. But this time I want to make a big batch of mini cookies for my kid's birthday. What should be the oven settings? And anything to watch out for while making it miniature? Also was wondering if I can sprinkle your favorite confetti on top or m&m
Ok. So i've just tried this recipe and it is the BEST EVER! Thank you so much for this amazing recipe girl! Loves from turkey 💕
What can I do if I want chewy cookies? To be honest, I don’t like soft or crunchy cookies or brownies my only go to is chewy ones :) if there are any tips for those I’d love to know! Thanks for amazing recipes as always!
amazing!
Hi Gemma! I am a Filipino fan of yours. I really enjoyed watching every videos of yours. I only have a convection oven, I wanna know how long will I bake the cookies? And what will be the temperature in celsius? Thank you so much!
what's the difference between these and the crazy cookies recipe
But how to get it crispy throughout??
Hi Gemma, Can we use wheat flour instead of plain flour
Can I use 3 eggs ?
how to make them hold their shape and not spread?and can you pls bake world peace cookies?
Plz upload eggless cookies recipe
Thank you so much for this recipe.....I tried it and it was awesome.... My family really loved it...😊😘
Hi can I use less sugar
Hi Gemma can I use coconut oil  instead of butter?
Hi Gemma! Can you (or someone) help me with something? :( I baked these cookies (and the brownie cookies too), but everytime they simply "melted" and turned one giant battee in the oven! 😱 Could this be because my oven is kinda old? Is it the butter?? (I let it chill in the fridge overnight!)
whats the difference in using melted butter and creaming the room temperature butter with the sugar? ive seen bakers used both techniques and i was wondering if there was a difference. Love your videos gemma!
Hi! whats the name of your oven gemma?
a very interesting recipe. thanks Gemma
Gemma Ma,am!plz give the recipe,ingredients list in descriptions box .
my dough turned out to be very crumbly I used sweetened condensed milk instead of eggs :( is there anything I can do now?
This recipe turned out great! Instead I made smaller cookies and I made 26 and in the next 2 hours my family had devoured them all. Today I’m gonna make some more for my aunt!💕✨
Please give instructions for majing  classic cookie just like this in a microwave....i have no accesss to an oven. I really want to try baking this cookie!!looks soo goooooood
Hi Gemma,  can i use canola oil instead of butter? thanks!
I can't wait to try your recipe Gemma! Thank you! Though I don't think I can wait 2 or 3 days!! 😅 I wouldn't be able to resist!
Hi Gemma! I wanted to ask you or anybody who can answer, can you bake these as a whole, or is it only possible to bake them individually? I believe it would be much easier and faster this way, and that is what I'm after ;)  (hope I made myself clear :)) by the way, just a few days ago I tried your best ever brownies recipe and it was THE BEST BROWNIE I HAVE EVER TASTED!
My sister hates chewy and gooey cookies. How do i make it cruncy and crispy like the famous amos cookies?
My cookies when baked rised up and after that got spread out what should I do please help?
Hey Gemma, these were by far the BEST cookies I've made. Your recipes are so fuss free and easy to follow. Gemma, I have kept the cookie dough to "age" in the refrigerator as you suggested. Do I get it to come to room temperature before baking?
I have all the ingredients except the Parchment paper 🙁😕🙄
These cookies were amazing,thanks Gemma!
great cookies,looks yummy to eat
can someone help me? how come it asks for 2 1/4 cups of flour but I needed to put an extra 1 cup of flour so it can look like how it did in the video? I swear the original flour recipe will always need more!!
Followed your recipe to the letter and even aged the dough overnight in the fridge. Formed the dough into 100g balls and baked them for 12 mins but they still ran, spread out and joined up together.
Hi Gemma 😍 I already baked my cookies. And Its so delicious 😍
Hi Gemma, I love your vids, just wondering should you preheat your oven to 190 or just turn it on when your putting the cookies in?
I made this today, My dough is getting chilled this night. Excited for tomorrow 😍
Hi gemma 👋 is there a difference when the flour is sifted or not? Thanks a lot 😊
Hi Gemma  Your ‘best ever chocolate chip chocolate cookies ‘ are great . I followed the recipe to a ‘T’ but for some reason the cookies all came out very flat . Any possible reason you think ?
love the recipes
Please do a vegan recipe please
These cookies turned out delicious, Gemma. Thank you for all these delicious recipes you keep on sharing with us. Love, Ghita from San Francisco.
Hi Gemma! I tried your best ever chocolate chip cookie recipe and it didn't work! My cookies spreaded too much, I ended up with one giant cookie, it looked done on the bottom, the edges were fine but the rest was too gooey. What could I have done wrong?

Hi Gemma, I've been looking for a good chewy cookie recipe but most of the recipes I tried turned out to be crunchy. Do you have any specific recipe for chewy cookies? Thank you!!!
Hi Gemma! I did the exact same thing as the recipe says but it wasnt ready at 12mins, what did I do wrong? Haha
hi gemma, need some expert advice i was whipping cream the other day it was not forming stiff peaks i was whipping for almost 30 minutes i chilled my bowl and whisk attachment what did i did wrong??  i used all purpose cream
Hi gemma, I just want to ask, how to make a full crispy chocolate chip cookies. Do u have any tips, thanks ❤
I've been searching for the perfect cookie recipe for a long time... and this is it
I made these and they are great. BUT for me they did not spread enough if not squished down! They were too fat when I left them as balls. Not sure why since there is enough butter in the recipe. Good thing I divided the dough into two batches just in case and to have them fresh.
Can i use white choc?
Hey I know I’m quite late but I love homemade chewy choc chip cookies, I don’t hate crunchy and soft ones but I guess I jus5 enjoy chewy ones WAYYYY more :) is there anything I can do to make them more chewy? Can I cake them for a little longer or soem5ing? Thanks ! I love your videos and recipes because they are always foolproof and simple but absolutely delicious <33

Hi Gemma,I tried this in microwave.they got hardened on cooling.Can you suggest how to get them soft & crunchy.
Please do best ever macarons! The French ones though, not the coconut ones. I always find myself looking for a good recipe and can never find one. They are so complicated and hard to make I know you would do a great job at explaining how to make them. Thank you!
BEST EVER!  These are seriously the most amazing cookies I've ever had.  I am never making another chocolate chip cookie recipe again!
I made those and turned out perfect, thank you for the amazing recipe Gemma ❤️❤️
Normally all these cookies can keep for how long in an air tight container? Thanks
I tried this its not bad
I made the dough yasterday and put it in the fridege , now the dough is sooo hard and i'm waiting for it to soft  a little bite , i cant wait to eat my cookie 💓
My sister's birthday is coming in the summer.I always try out your recepies and she absolutely adores it!!!she says"the chef who made these must be a genius,there really yummy❤"but can you make an easy to make oreo ice cream cake?I really want to make it.
Hi Gemma,can you make a video of how to make Cocoa Powder
These look delicious, but I prefer smaller cookies. Should I bake them at the same temperature and for how long?
Wow...tasty
I love your baking LOVE YOU!!!!!!!
I'm just making these. Omggggggg, the dough tastes like heaven, I can't stop eating!!! Who needs cookies if you have cookie dough;)
Please upload cookies baked in microwave oven
I have been a failure at making cookies but this was literally the best cookie I have ever made. Soft and chewy inside with a crisp outside. This is hands down the best chocolate cookie recipe.
I just made them ......DELICIOUS!!! Why Gemma it came very thin? Is not like yours...
I will agree...these were great! I'm going to use this recipe from now on, but half the chocolate for us.
please make chocolate crinkles
is it okay if i use baking powder instead of soda? also i'd love it if you could make a collab with CupcakeJemma!!!
Вауу!! так вкусно выглядит, всё очень красиво, и вы очень красивая! хочу теперь приготовить это чудо и съесть с молоком :D 😍
I tried them todayy and they were way too good. Perfectly chewy from the middle and amazing on the edges. Thank you soo much.
I accidentally put too much baking powder!!😣😣 wat will Happen if i bake it?!
I made them today, and they were SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD!!! IT WAS THE BEST AMONG THE RECIPES THAT I HAVE TRIED! Thank you so much Gemma :D
hi gemma. how do i adjust the recipe to get crispy cookies? thanks from Malaysia.
this channel is underrated
Do I have to use Baking Soda or is it possible to use Baking Powder?
I want to make a lot of your recipes, could you start telling us the measurements in your videos?
Hi gemma i tried your recipe a second time but with slight variations. I replaced half of the all purpose flour with whole wheat flour and also incorporated some coco powder and the result was heavenly
I don't have butter so what I DOOO 😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔
Oh wow, those are some of the best looking chocolate 'chip' cookies ive ever seen 😍 I prefer using chunks instead of chips too!
Hi Gemma I'm one of your fans n I was wondering how do you make blueberry cheese tart n strawberry tart??  I really love those two n I was hoping I can get to learn to make n sell at my hometown cause I was able to sell your apple crumble recipe that I made!!!
It s been years since I had a decent chocolate chip cookie. I must try this recipe.
hi.. i follow ur recipe but i reduced the sugar to the half.. output is very good but it didnt become flat from top as urs.. wonder why??
looks good!!!!
How long should you bake it if you made one big cookie?
Hi I love your cookie  mixture, how do we make it  crunchy  instead of  being soft in the center? in my country a soft cookie is considered  stale, so no one will eat it.
if i wanted it to be super duper gooey could i bake it for a little less? like maybe 10 or 11 minutes?
Mam your respice is really osm
my pleasure beautiful 💋💋ur recipes are jst amazing ❤luvv uhh
Why you use melted butter?
Preheatingat 190c is required or not?
Muito bom gemma só receita de coisa gostosa!!!
Can you use dark brown sugar instead of light brown
Hey Gemma i have a question: if I don't have baking soda, do I use four times baking powder instead? Or will the cookies only puff up and not spread ? ( I really like your recipes☺️)
Its really good but too sweet
Hi Gemma I baked these cookies n they r awesome my kids loved it the salty taste in it gives it an extra omph love from Pakistan
صباح الورد♡♡♡ لقذ غيرت رقمي اولا وضاع اشتراكي معاكي هاذي فترا وانا ابحث عنكي حتى وجدتكي اليوم انني جذ مسرورا بي اشتراكي مرا ثاني على قناتك انني احبكي جدا جدا♡♡♡♡♡♡♡ اتمنا ان تزورينا بي مغرب عربي مرحبا بك♡♡♡♡♡♡♡
Hi chef, love your mug cake recipes, want to try this one too but don’t know how to preheat my oven! Can you pls tell me how to preheat kitchenaid oven?
My cookies spread out flat! What did I do wrong???😩😩😩😩😩
That's how i like my cookies. Could i use raw sugar instead i use it a lot
Mam can we see recipe video with egg substitute from your end ..Thanks A Lot ..
Dear gemma, I have a question. If a cookie is still "doughey" in the middle like this one, how long will it last before it goes bad? Will it go bad quicker than a cookie that's crispy all the way through? Thank you..
I made cookies from this recipe and it was sooo damn good 😍😍😍 !!!
WOW... COOKIES LOOK FUCKING AWESOME... THANKS GEMMA STAFFORD
Is there a way we can melt the chocolate while the chocolate itself is in the cookies?
My cookies alway burn’s out from the bottom..the temp is the same as yours but still it always burns..could you please help me out with it?
I love all of ur recipes😍😍😍..how to bake ur cookies without oven
I made this but i think those turned out nice but a little too sweet
Yum Yum Yum...I so love it 😋😋😋
I like how you are so specific with everything especially the time. All recipes are like 8-12 mins
If you use only white sugar or even light brown sugar your cookies will not look as good. Use dark brown sugar it will make the cookies look and taste better
Hi Gemma can you do a pancake video please
I made this and they are AWSOMEEE AND DELICOUDE
Happy Birthday Gemma!
Happy Birthday Gemma!!
My cookies are flattening in the oven tho i refrigerated them can you tell me why please

Please make honey lavender ice cream
Hello Gemma,  My daughter and I made your Best Chocolate Chip Cookies 🍪 they’re so delicious 😋 only difference I made was instead of 2 cups bitter sweet chocolate we used 1 cup semi sweet and 1 cup milk chocolate chips. I’ll post a few pictures on my Instagram mrs.h2013 and Facebook Tammylynn Hill page. Thank you very much for this recipe, we can’t wait to make so many more of your delicious recipes. 😍🍪💯♥️
Thanks Gemma your recipes are always reliable because I made before were flat but these were fudgy and sooooo yummy 😊😊😊😊😜😜😜😜❤❤❤❤
GEMMA have u ever come across carrot cookies with orange icing? They r a many generation standard n my family but I've never seen them any where else & would love to c ur take on them. If not let me give u some clues. They r a very cakey dough with plenty of shortening, almost a scone. They have no spices like a carrot cake & we glaze them with a powdered sugar icing flavored with orange juice concentrate & a little zest. These cookies r the most amazing when eaten directly out of the freezer.  Please let me kno if u have ever come across them? I think they would b rite up ur taste bud alley 😊
Hello Gemma! I finally found the perfect recipe; yours is exactly how I want my cookies. I have one question, is it impossible to do this in an oven toaster or a microwave? I don't have an oven like yours.
Thanks so much for sharing this Gemma.  I am totally making these and I'm going to try your 5-day trick.  Thanks so much again.  (I like your nails!)
Are u going to travel more? I love that series, especially with Ireland. I’m def gonna visit for the fish and chips.
Those cups are the cutest!
gemma , I found powdered sugar better than granulated because sugar crystals didn't melt
Thank you so much for making these! I love cookies and it's fantastic to see one of my favourite bakers making them. <3 Have a great day everyone!
Perfect!
Gemma if we want to make a double chocolate cookie then what is the measurement for the cocoa powder and the sugar
Hi Miss Gemma you r glowing, love the hair btw 😅! Thanks you as always for the wonderful video. I’m definitely gonna try this out 👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿
I tried making these and they turned out just perfect! But they weren't circular in shape I don't know why.
plzzzzz make a eggless cookies video u always use egg plzzz show eggless
You totally rock Gemma!  Finally a baker that uses salted butter.  I really cant stand the baking snobs that insist on unsalted.  Bunch of bunk!  Thanks a bundle Gemma!
Those look so good .. . Can you create a recipe for petit four please
I've been waiting for this video!
Pls help. My cookies after baked is still like a ball.  Pls help i want it be flat.😭 Thank you
pls make mini tart shells
Thank you Gemma! I love your cookie recipes,  and for the one's that call for butter, Kerry Gold Irish Butter can't be beat! I'm going to try this out, using the Belgian Chocolate bars that I picked up on my last visit to Trader Joe's! ♡♡♡
Your little bites are sweet, but honestly,  I could have shoved half that cookie in my mouth😁
Hello, Gemma. The freezer dough should be put in the oven right away or defrost it in microwave, or just keep it outside till it goes to room temperature. Please let me know. I really want to make it in advance.
I made them by substituting 2 eggs by 150 gm of condensed milk(8 tablespoon;80 gm sugar) and reduced sugar accordingly, had to do a bit of math😁 They came out perfect, the way I wanted crisp on the outside and soft & chewy in the middle with that oozing dark chocolate. Loved it. Thanks a ton Gemma!
I don’t see the difference between this recipe and the others
Do we have to cooling the melted butter?
Looks amazing! How are these after they've cooled though?
Why melt the butter? Softened would do just as well.
Looks so good! But all that sugar though... ahh!
I hate a soft center cookie any tips to make them more crunchy?
You really are one of the rare person actually explaining the purpose of the ingredients
I love your recipes. when I bake cookies  my boys always compliment how they loves the cookie I bake and they are the. Best ever! 😊 thank you for sharing your recipes and allowing my kids to think I’m  the best Baker 😂  you’re awesome! These are exactly the memories I want to create for my boys! Thanks again!
amazing....👍
I wanted to make these for my friend because he's a huge fan of these kind of cookies. He is not in the same city as mine which means I have to send it through a package. Gemma, how to store these cookies and how long it can last?
Hi Gemma ..these beauties look delicious.. Can u plz share d link of egg substitute?
I have to refrain myself from licking the screen...
Smaller cookies would mean lesser cooking time?
Hey Gemma  For the chocolate would you say to use dark chocolate or milk chocolate Thanks lots Abudi
Looks gorgeous and so mouthwatering; I shouldn't be getting the munchies this close to midnight lol. Btw, does anyone know how to convert this recipe to make perfectly crunchy cookies, no chewy texture? Do I just bake them for longer? My peeps love them crunchy.
It looks soo good!!! Is there any substitute for egg??
I made them this morning, but I had to go back to the video for the overn-temperature, its not on the blogpost haha. (or maybe im blind)
hello Gemma you can put the recipe gram too
😍😍😍😍
The both recipes are too good .😊👍👍👌.. but I have one question when I use egg substitution the recipe goes wrong, so what must be the problem ......
Gemma can we use oil in place of butter? I mean i am trying to become vegan and wanted to know if i can use oil and leave out egg? Thanks
can we use jagery instead of brown sugar
i will definitely do that... <3
There you go again changing the game for all the cookie lovers lol they look amazing and so easy to make and bake. Thanks for making cooking fun again you're awesome!!   Sincerely, Your number one fan 🙌😁💪🎊🎉💯✔
gemma, you said can keep the cookie dough for a few days before baking. so you keep in the freezer or chiller? thanks
What if I wanted it to become crispy like cookies from store?

Hi.Can please you make milshakes without ice cream. Cause I love you're recipes
yummy😋😋cookies.... i wanna make n have it too😍😍
You are awesome I love your recipes they are simply full proof I tried them they tasted wonderful and super-duper delicious
and what do you suggest to replace egg yolks...i have seen your chart but i wish to add yolk for moisture so thinking of it as half an egg doesnt seem right...pls help..
and i have this doubt that they say using melted butter can give you flattened cookies...but yours didnt seem flatten?why?can you do a video on cookie science?
ive been wanting to say this since a long time...gemma i used to think you're British cos of your accent but when you say stuff like "butter" it didnt sound like british sometimes but when i saw a video where you said you're irish..everything seemed to be adding up.....wow its weird because you sound like a british person...lol.....anyway...i really like some of your recipes......and seem kinda sweet too..."_
I've missed quite a few of ur videos in this month and I have the flu so I'm pumped to binge watch all these amazing videos! !!❤
Yummmyyy😁
Love from India.....:-) Was looking fr such recipe
Hi Gemma, what would I need to do if I wanted to make double chocolate chip cookies with this recipe?
Yummm!
Can we add oil instead of butter?
Hoping too make them this weekend yummy!
hmmm.seems so delicious yummy cookie..gonna try this.😋
this looks good,easy&great gemma.i gotta try&do this&some of ur vids 4myself.props 2u.love ur vids.they got heart,homely&welcomely.keep on doing what ur doing.

And if I like crunchy and crispy cookies . What do I do then ?
I need that cookies!!!!! 😍😍😍
Thank you so much for your easy and delicious recipes! I can’t wait to make this. Thank you
I really like this type of cookies i will try it soon thank you mush love for you
Those chunks 😋
These cookies are going to make me break my diet 🤣🤣
Just curious, but Gemma, will you ever do a meet and greet?
I am already loving them😍😍😘
Even tho one cookie comes up to 485cal, it's worth the calories!! Definitely gonna make this sometimes
Hi gemma i am 11 years old,i try all of ur recipies.i have a request could u plz make honey walnut pie in your next video 😊😊😊.
Hi Gemma, I will try this recipe though I have tried a recipe even earlier and it just didn't get flattened while it was baking and then got burnt, can you advice as to what could have gone wrong ?
For ageing the dough, do we need to keep it in a fridge for 5 days or at room temperature?
Very good
Gemma❤️Those cookies 😍And and you shirt suits you so much ❤️ lots of love ❤️
Ohhh i love cookies. Please can you make barbie cake
This is how i make. Except I only use one egg. And chopped white chocolates and dark chocolate chips 50/50. Brown sugar is a must otherwise it might spread.
What temperature do we bake it off at? I can't find what temperature on your written recipe.
The cookies are perfect!😍
You are the best!!😍
The best way to celebrate republic day holiday. A family quiz time and the winner gets to collect the cookies. Thank you for the recipe. What do you suggest would be an apt substitute for egg in this.
Can u do more of eggless cookies n cakes pls
Even 5 year old child can make your 🍪. It's soo easy.
I will highly recommend you to take a small piece of cookie dough and put it in the microwave and find that would it work in microwave. Love ya. Please try that. These look yummy
I love your video... Can you please do  lemon cookies..
Awesome awesome perfect recipe! I have tried storing dough when I did your crazy cookie recipe and it's really true what you said about ageing the dough. Thanks a lot for all your tips aside from sharing your best recipes. I have a question about adding some cornstarch into the cookie dough, how important is that? they say it makes the cookies softer, could you please shed some light on this?Thanks a bunch!!
How long should I be baking bincase I want the entire cookie crunchy? I am not a fan of gooey in the centre cookie. Please help!!!
what if i want to make 'em all through crispy?
Why does my jaw hurt and my mouth water? Is it because you make the best cookies,brownies,cakes, Cheesecakes .etc.?
If I freeze the cookie dough balls, do I need to defrost before baking?
How long do you cook it when you’re making from frozen?
Hey Gemma! I love your recipes! How simple they are and how lovely the results are! 😍😍😍 I wanted to ask where did you do your culinary education from? I am planning to be a chef but don't know where to go.
Do I have to wait for the butter to cool?  Also I don't have salted butter....it's okay right?
Hi gemma
Awesome
The main effect of letting cookie dough rest is hydrating the starches.  Most of this will happen in the first 4 hours, and it will be pretty much complete overnight.   Bakers doing it for 3-4 days is probably more about managing production schedules than needing to age the dough that long.
These look fantastic Gemma! I cant wait to try them out for myself. ❤
yum! these look delicious!😋
They look perfect! :)
Yum yum yum...
Hey Love! Quick question...when you say age your dough, do you mean leave it in the fridge for up to 5 days? Thx!
What do you have to say about being a  pastry chef
Lovely...  Best recipe
Hi gemma! I like my cookies crispy both inside and the outside. If i want the inside to be crispy as well, should i bake thr cookies longer or do i need an entirely different recipe?
"Chocolate Chip Chunkage" :) :) Haha where has that phrase been my whole life!!? Can't wait to make these! XO
do i portion dough before freezing? how do i bake frozen dough? do i thaw first or just bake longer. thanks alot
Love and love it
#cookiegold = cookie goals.
Do they stay soft and chewy. Aka not turn long into hard rocks as the sugar hardens.
Loved your best ever series.. 😍 Definitely gonna make these..After watching your videos I tasted gooey cookies for the first time when I made your double chocolate cookies from the crazy cookie dough and it was Love ❤😙😙 Often make crazy dough for pizzas 😄
I love your accent!!
I was watching this video when I heard a plaintive noise, like my dog makes when he's watching me eat something that he really wants, but the dog isn't here.   I was forced to admit that the pathetic hungry noise came out of me.    I hope you're happy!
Amazballs! They look delicious! I hope you have a great day precious
Hi Gemma!  Could you please make a what I eat in a day video?  Always wondering how you maintain your figure with all these tempting cookies and cakes❤
Need to try these !!also what cocoa brand do you use and recommend?
I‘ve done them  right away an they are absolutely delicious. My son loves them. A typical Gemma recipe. Never failing. Thanks Gemma 🤗
yum, i love chocolate chip cookies!
I enjoy watching ur videos every single day. Thanks for sharing. I made ur no machine ice cream it was so nice. I flavored it with mint.
I'll try this recipe for sure😍😋😋😋
GEMMA I WAS JUST ABOUT TO MAKE SOME COOKIES AND I DIDNT KNOW WHAT TO MAKE AND...BOOM! You came on! YAY!!!!!!!!
hi there!! these are my hubby's favourite cookies and i haven't found a good recipe yet! so i will try with yours, last time i baked a batch i used mascobado sugar , is that considered "dark brown sugar" for americans? so maybe i need to find a lighter version
I don’t think it’s much of a “secret” that people put brown sugar in chocolate chip cookies...
Great cookies! Looks yummie. Did you trip and hurt yourself??
My goodness I had to make these Gemma, those look amazing 😍
Hi That looks so good I love to cook
Omg these look amazing and I just got off of my military diet, I want these so bad
Love you gemma
if you freeze this do you bake it right away or thaw it first?
Is the chocolate you use regular eating chocolate or specific baking chocolate? everytime i use baking chocolate it always burns in the oven.
These look perffffect
Hi Gemma! I live in England. And I just want to know which brands of chocolate would you recommend baking with?
Such a gem to wake up to! Thank you so much for this!
5:05 This where i hate you the most 😭😭😭
Hey gemma i love cookies ts looks too good 😊 but can u tel me without oven how to bake cookies plz
this cookies look good to eat
If I freeze the dough, can it go straight from the freezer to the oven? and how much time should I let it bake then?
These cookies look soooooooo good! Omg! ❤
Hello random persin scrolling through the comments!
Can I replace the baking soda with self rising four
Just Love it Gemma!!!Thanks!!!🍪😋
Yummmmm!! They look great Gemma!!!🤤🤤😊😘😘❣️
I love soft in the middle cookies and abit hard on the outside😍Yum❤
Omg yummmmmm😍😍😍😍🍫
uhhhh gemma? brown sugar is NOT a secret ingredient
I pray hope that I meet someone like her with those kitchen skills and knowledge when I'm done with university
Hi Gemma I absolutely love your crazy cookie dough however i will give these ago tooooo  Thank you
Yummy
captions not uploaded yet?
Can we use baking powder ?
Gemma those cookies look amazing Cookie Monster will be proud gotta go make some cookies hint hint their chocogemma cookies
Omg they r amazing
Those cookies look awesome.  Question — if you’re going to go ahead and melt all that butter, why not go further and brown it?
You have already taught us how to make nutella at home.. But can you please please make a video on how to make those malted bread sticks that come along with nutella???
THE BEST cookies!!!!!! I have made them four times in one week!!!!!
Hello Gemma!  I am gluten free, and I was wondering if you could do a video on how to make gluten free cinnamon roles.  I LOVE cinnamon roles, but I can't eat the pre-made ones and I don't know how to make them.  Hopefully you can come up with a recipe!  Thank you for all your other delicious baking treats!!:)
Hey Gemma I making your cookies right now and I went onto the recipe and you forgot to tell me what the baking temperature is, thankfully you said in the video but I thought you’d want to know that
Hi everyone! Just One extra tip I think you have to try out! Give some chopped walnuts to te dough, and it will make it even more heavenly❤️
Love this ! Plz can we have some more pet friendly treats !
looks yummy,thanks Gemma
Hi Gemma i absolutely love your recipes, they are amazing 😉... can i please ask you question if i want the cookies to be crispy not gewy in the middle how am i suppose to change the sugars  ratio?
Buonasera Gemma. Wowww..these cookies looks so amazing and gorgeous. Mmmhhh..so good. Bravissimaaaa..☺😚
Gemma, wish you add subtitles for everyone.
aww what happened to your right hand Gemma? I hope nothing important. xx
Amazing, the cookies lool delicious!  But i have one question: how can i substitute salted butter? It's almost nowhere to find where i live. Shal i just add a bit more salt?
So yummy😋😋
I made double chocolate cookies from your crazy cookie dough recipe..and they were amazing. Surely soon i will try this recipe. Thanks Gemma.
Measurements ? Great vid tho 😄
You look so pretty. Love the hair do,  your make up looks fab too.
Luv u n ur recipies
Pls mention measurements for ingredients.....
Oooooooh god looks amazing i will make it as soon as i can 😍
Yes! I always bake my cookies at 375 instead of 350. The increase in temp caramalizes the sugar.
Gemma r u sick?
Just eate but hungry again😣
Baking is an art  Gemma is a connoisseur  Make way for some bold baking bakers Love you gemma, the recipes that you share are amazing and the substitutes you suggest make sure all are included I hope that the bigger bolder community keeps expanding. Lots of love❤❤
Gemma can you make indian desserts please
subsititute of baking soda to baking powder,is it okay?
Ms.Gemma.. you understand me. ♡ #iamdacookiefiend
Hi, Gemma! I'm in love with all of your recipes! I want to ask: can I reduce the amount of white and brown sugar? Will it affect the result (texture and etc.)? I love not so sweet cookies and I try to reduce the sugar intake soo...
Do you have a recipe for Mint Chocolate Chip cookies?
Gemma why dont you write a bold baking book it will so useful for us
Tomorrow is a bigg day for me please wish good luck for me gemma
That looks so deliciousss!!! Definitely gonna try it out! Gemma, should the ageing be inside or outside the fridge?
Hey Gemma, can you make cookies that have the same taste as the Famous Amos' ones? :)
Who are the 2 crazy nut jobs that didn't like this recipe😯😒😭😭😭😭😭
Best Ever indeed! :)
3:19  chill the cookies for an hours
delicious
Hey Gemma can u make some Indian sweet dishes pls
Super yummy and tasty recipe thnx God bless u 😊
Hi Gemma! I want to substitute eggs with sweetened condensed milk. Should I reduce the amount of sugar? If yes, then by how much? How different would the cookies be as compared to when made with eggs?
Cookies are my life😃
What if you want them to be crunchy instead of chewy and soft?
My mouth is watering. Cant wait to try this recipe out.
these look great. Do you have a recipe that would use lemon flavored chips
Hi, Gemma Stafford you are the best baker I have ever seen. You have become my idol so now I always watch your videos, bake what you made and add additional ingredients. You are the best❤️❤️
Gemma can I add vegetable oil instead of butter,?
Can this recipe be made in a convection microwave
They look amazing!!!! 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😌🤤🤤🤤🤤
Hi Gemma! It looks perfect...Thanks for the recipe...but wat changes shud I make to make it crispy....I like crispy choc chip cookie 😁... Dont forget to reply soon
Hi gemma aaaammmazing recipie i would love to see some convection Microwave recipies
Can I use hard margarine instead of butter?
These cookies look perfect, I really fancy one of these right now 😋 Thanks for sharing! Hope you and Kevin are keeping well
Gemma why is it when the cookie dough doesn't melt and spread out in the oven???? 😭
Gemma Stafford - Nothing better than a 'mix it, scoop it, drop it, bake it' cookie recipe because some times you just don't feel like fussing with fancy!! My mom used to make her chocolate chip, she used light brown sugar tho, and peanut butter cookies the same way, her hand written recipe card specifically says 'bake for no more than 11 to 13 minutes'.   Way back in the day when I was a little boy brother and I knew a holiday was coming up because mom was busy making different types of cookie dough. For days we had no cookies but we did have bowls of dough in the fridge. You made me smile when you explained aging the dough, I never knew it had a name, all I knew is we had no cookies for days. THANKS!
Great!! Brown sugar gives the crispness . But want to know how to get crispy cookies both inside n outside?
Hi Gemma, noticed that the ingredients was same as the one from crazy cookie dough. Is this better than that? I have made the crazy cookie dough twice within 2 weeks :) Love it 💕
yep right when you said butter I was like she has to be Irish
Your cookies are so delicious!!!
I had seen one video where the chef mentioned that her secret ingredient to good chocolate chip cookies was adding some cornstarch and beating the butter with a spatula rather than creaming it in the standmixer. I wonder what role the cornstarch plays in it. I guess everybody has a different way of making it it special. Your best-ever series is truly the best.
How to achieve throughout  chewy cookies?? Please Gemma or anyone else can answer??
I'm imagining the smell... 😍😛
I second the best ever label. This is the same recipe I use and they are seriously good, what is new to me is the ageing the dough.  Should it be aged at refrigerator temperatures or will it also age while frozen?
my family loves your single serving chocolate chip cookie :P but, it doesn't come out the same when I double or triple the recipe :3
hi gemma i wanted to ask that i am going to make a cheesecake so which one will be the best oven bake , microwave or no bake...
Hi,can you make cookie cake I have try it at home, and you can also pot ice cream on top,please please please make it,and thx ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🖤💕
😛😋😋
YUM yum YUM yum YUM!!!!
Best👍🏼as always
Could you use light brown sugar
I love your viedeos
Yum! Chocolate chip cookies and brownies are my two favorite desserts! I could eat them anytime anywhere!
I have tried over a thousand recipes of chocolate chip cookies but they always come out doughy and undercooked .......finally a recipe I can believe in .....it's Gemma's recipe of course it's gonna work 😘👍😘
Omggg! My recipe is almost same as urs!! This makes me sooooo happppyyyy!
Amazing
As I commented many times, I'm gonna repeat: my dream came true. But my oven is kinda weak so they may take more than 12 minutes. This is exactly what happened to the brownies, they took around an hour to bake (but it was so good, worth waiting). Anyway, if I bake the cookies on more than 190°, they will burn on the bottom and still be kinda raw on the top, help Gemma, what do you suggest me to do? Love you so much 💗💗
Woooooow😍
Afternoon Gemma! I was wondering if you could put a link for all the cute baking materials you have like your measuring cups and rubber spatulas. Great video as always. Was searching for a new choco chip recipe; thanks for sharing.
Ohmygod stop im on a diet
THIS IS WHAT I SIGNED UP FOR
Wowww..  Drooling..  Yepeeee..  One more super yummy cookie recipe.. M dam sure dis r also super yummy..  Like ur crazy dough cookies.. I make them very often..  N everytime they come out perfect...tnks for one more recipe Gemma..
Also it would be nice if you could show how to make a eggless chocolate cake with buttercream frosting in microwave. I hope I am not asking for too much 😛😛
It is my favorite, yum!
Pls can you show how to make them in microwave?? Thank you
These. Look. Absolutely. Delicious  Thanks for sharing Gemma, I’m gonna try out this recipe soon! They look so gooey and lovely 😍 awesome video 👍🏻
So if you are using a convection oven should you still bake them for 12 minutes?
Gemma can you plz try to make in microwave
Gemma you are just ameging  , defiantly I will try  .Tnx
Gemma, you're the best 😘 the first thing that came in my mind today when i woke up was your upcoming chocolate chip cookie video, was desperately waiting for a recipe like this, thanks!
Woww... Best ever.. loved it... Thank you for sharing..
Oh my gosh! Those look like my kind of cookie! You can never go wrong with Chocolate Chip cookies and a tall glass of milk! Loved the video Gemma :)
I appreciate your recipe but it's good old toll house back of the bag recipe for me!
Ooo yummy. Can you olease make reese cake
Gemma Your hair looks amazing today 😍 (or the day you shot this video)
Can you do a vegan cookie recipe please?

Gemma u r my best teacher and mine baking ideal too...
Why use cold butter if you’re going to melt it? 🤔😂
Yummy 🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪
Can you make cookies like subway does ? Would love a new season of copycat recipes
Yes! I have been waiting for this video! It is fabulous!
I can wait to try these ultimate best ever chocolate chunk cookies....
Must make these NOW!!!
Gemma can you suggest us a recipe of chocolate chip cookies without brown sugar
This maybe the most perfect cookie recipe that I have been looking for. Great job.
Hey Gemma!!!!! Can we use jaggery instead of the brown sugar .... ????
Wow its so delicious. And mouth watering. great video always 😊
TDF! Going to make these as Lunar New Year presents for family and friends. Thanks Gemma!
Looks yummy !!
Yuppie.....tasty tasty but Gemma can we eat this cookie with peanut milk
Thanks again,Beautuful Gemma. ☆♡☆¤
Thanks for the secret! I need to try aging the dough even for a day or two - if nobody else finishes the dough.
Too good...
I love how you explain everything so perfectly! Great recipe and great tips as always!
Thank you so much Gemma,! I'm trying these right away!🍫 💜💛
These are amazing, Gemma! This is a great recipe for a perfect chocolate chip cookie recipe. Yum, I will definitely try this!
Looks yummy...
mmmm yummy I like to bake my cookie's till they are crunchy  in the middle and the outer layer to I can eat cookie's like the one's you made but I can only eat a few bite's than I get growsted out and my stumach  hurt's so that's way I and my some of my family like are cookie's bake crunchy in and outer layer anyways maybe I'll give you recipie's a try.
Do you have a certain brand of flour you find the best results with? I started using unbleached King Arthur flour thinking it was better quality but all my recipes come out "off" texture and flavor wise. Much more dense and not sure how to explain difference in flavor. Any suggestions would be much appreciated!
Amazing Cookies! Great recipe Gemma and I won't forget rating it on your website :)  Cheers from Dubai!😊
These cookies look delicious I need to try this out
Came over immediately after seeing the notifications. Definetely making this on weekends. Wish me luck
Its here !!!!!!!!
Fabuleux. ..
Cookies look fantastic Gemma!!!!
Ooohhh those look perfect👌. Never tried with the chocolate bar, but oh man I will🍫.  Where do you leave the dough to age tho, in the refrigerator or freezer?
I want all that Yummmmny  Plz make melted choclate filled cookies
If I want the cookies to be crispier, should I bake it longer on the same temperature?  Edit: My friend likes crunchy cookies and I'm making it for him.
Happy birthday in advance Gemma!💙💙💙 mine is on the 29th! We're both Aquariuses
Gemma, if you age your dough as you suggested in the video, do you need to cover it with plastic wrap?
Ahhh! I was hoping you posted this one, so easy and mouth watering recipe, thank you, I'm so excited, I will make it today, can't wait :D <3
Yes Gemma,Why don't you try an Indian cooking series?
I have to try these.😊
My mouth is watering....... gemma.  You are the best ever bold baker who made best ever chocolate chip cookies, best ever banana bread....

I just made five different flavours using your crazy cookie dough, including regular chocolate chip, all the flavours are absolutely amazing!  Edit- I recognise most of the ingredient quantities, isn't this the same dough as the crazy cookie dough with added chocolate chips?
