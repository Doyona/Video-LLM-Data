A lot more robutht
Drain that greasy meat and beans...please
typically a good cup and half for chili.
WATER? Spicy V8 and beef broth/stock
Nice recipe but did this channel get hacked? All the new content is so different from the older stuff and just a bunch of AI stuff which is complete opposite of the older content that was food.
Try kidney beans with juice, garlic, broth not water, touch of sugar, fennel seeds crushed. 😊
Water?!  No.
When do you add the noodles?
Instead of water use beef stock.
World’s shittiest chilli recipe!!😂😂
This is the best. I've made chili for yrs w/complex to average recipes. This is the best & so easy. I've shared w_ several friends.
This looks like chili soup to me
I always add a small can of chopped green chilis.
How much water to add?
That's more than a pound of ground beef bruh
Use beef broth instead of water.   Cook in crockpot.    Kidney beans and half that amt he uses.
Use beer instead of water. ;)
I like to add green pepper to mine, am I the only one?
This is not the world's greatest chilling you dont use oil cc to make it hamburger n makes it's own grease I watched how you made it would rather eat shit than the way you make it
Put a can of tomato soup.  @ stalks of celery finely diced one whole green pepper. Put the cery and peppers in before the onions cook then for about 2 min then add the onions and mak it a whole onion.   Put 1/2 xup of water insead.  Add 2 teaspoons of sugar at the end.  NOW it's the greatest chili.
Instead of adding water add chicken stock and cinnamon, you're welcome
I would use beef broth instead of water other than that it looks like a really good recipe And I like to add a few mild jalapeño peppers cut up
I cook with cast iron but simmer mine in my crock pot
Use half beef,half pork.....ad a 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon....more onions and peppers....no cumin
I use black beans as well
Two onions ...
Use pinto beans. Ole!
World's greatest chili? This isn't even chili. Chili doesn't have beans.
This is pathetic.
Beans? Not chili.
Good recipe but if I  crack an onion,  the whole thing is going in.
I use stew meat with no beans. Beans adds no flavor just volume and goes farther. Without beans chili can get spendy.
Im sorry butt water takes all the grease and flavor away
Yummy!!!♥️
I always come back to this video when I make chilli. This is quick and simple. Of course I add extra to it but this is good for a quick video
I have made chili for many years, even worked at a restaurant devoted to Chile in DC(late 80's). I dont mind making my own chili powder, prepping veggies by hand, etc But....a good basic , quick recipe is what I searched and got yours! Thanks.  For those who say they dont cook i say cooking is about making it your way, for the mood you are in.
Why are you putting tomatoes in it?
Mariconson
2 cloves chopped garlic sauted, get Organic beans please, 1 tablespoon cumin, NO Water 2 cups Organic bone both. I love chili freezer the extra ♡
I hate when all these recipes say "add water" man add stock, its free flavour that adds so much more depth.
Thufferin’ thuckatash, that is a good rethipe. 😂😂😂
Sorry but can't be a best chilly, you need to fry the spices in the oil with the onion to release the flavou.
Shouldn't we drain the fat before adding all the other ingredients and such?
I hate onions so couldn't do this one.
Texas calling. BEANS?! BEANS?!. What you’ve got there is ground beef and beans. Good, but not chili. Where are the chilis?
My dad always used red beans. More flavor than regular chilli beans
Why don’t you go make mayonnaise mayonnaise
Ain't this a BLEEP!!! He doesn't tell us how much water he adds in or how long he lets it simmer to give us an idea...... oh well, nice video still.  You did what I was gonna do except for that tip you gave on black beans.... nice!!!
Intresting it is Columbo recipe??
Nice recipe simple and I like the fact that you didn't use chilli powder mixture I love when someone cooks uses fresh ingredients
What??????  Not browning the beef?  Cooking with gray meat is a mistake.
I like the recipe except the beans.....
You're a LEGEND!!!
I don't understand the name of the ingredient at 1:19. You slurred words there. It's the ingredient just after the cayenne.
No Beans.
This is similar to the recipe my mother was making back in the 60's.  Only real difference is the beans, she always used dark red kidney beans.  Freeze any leftovers and they'll be just as good when you rewarm them.  Simple, cheap... and filling.
no garlic no celery no red peppers no hot peppers no sugar .. what the hell kinda chili is this . chili has to burn !!!
Drain the grease,😮
Looks like soup
Publix generic canned tomatoes?!
How long to simmer? I heard people simmer for 10 hrs! 🤔🤔
Tried your method and my chili turned out great…thanks for keeping it simple
Blqack beans is a mistake, true chilli is made with pinto beans
Great job 👏 thanks for sharing
I'd add a pepper and red chillies chopped and some dark chocolate
Nooooo way pass 😂
It actually did not look thick enough and I would use the whole onion nada 1/3 of one
You should list your ingredients so folks could follow it.
Awesome!!
the black beans red flag it no way!😢
Change the title to world’s blandest meat soup.  That an’t chili
People who don’t know how to cook shouldn’t post cooking videos
This has to the blandest tasting chili ever. No browing of the meat, no garlic, no tomato paste and what madman would put water in chili. This isn’t chili it’s meat soup
it looks good, my question is do you not drain the meat?
Rinse the black beans, drain your grease from beef, and I adore a can of MANWICH bold added in as well…. Never heard of adding more than half cup of water
I thought I just watched the world’s best chili video. Oh well, whatya got?
Pot is much to small
No garlic????
You left all that grease in there?
Same way in crock pot ?
I add garlic with the onions at the beginning. Or you can add the garlic later.
Crushed tomatoes bettet then tomato sauce. Thicker
That may be the worst looking chilli I’ve seen
I made it, and I must admit it's delicious, although I wish I had used a bit less salt than you suggested.  Just barely this side of too salty.  I think about 3/4th the salt you recommend would have been perfect.
A good chili is pretty simple and you can use the spices that you like in any ratio, but the key is to simmer very low for as long as you can until the spices bloom and the color changes to dark red.  Usually, about 2 hours and then you taste if it tastes like chili and all the spices have come together.  If you don’t cook it long enough, it tastes like tomato juice.  Maybe that just me.  Chili is pretty straightforward.  It just take patience! 😊
where is the whole recipe so I don’t have to keep following the transcript ??
No black beans, no brown beans, no white beans, no pinto beans. If it has beans, it's bean soup. Bean soup is good too, but it is not "CHILI". Chili "NEVER" has beans. 🔥
Thats the worst chilli recipe lol
instead of water i used tomato juice. and i seasoned with taco seasoning, turned out great.
Hopefully you get back to me. I was wondering, is it possible to make chilli mince beef without it being hot like just warm
Hopefully you get back to me. I was wondering, is it possible to make chilli mince beef without it being hot like just warm
drain the greasy hamburger meat.....
This is an easy recipe as delivered. I made it last week with red kidney beans and McCormick's chili mix. So I changed it a little but still an excellent recipe. My husband loved it with fresh hot corn bread. It's raining here in Washington state and I'm making it again tonight. Thank you so much!!!
why is it that every single chili recipe upload all say "worlds greatest". Especially when they mostly suck ass!
I just don’t believe it can be the greatest if most of the ingredients are canned. Lol! This is basically ground beef soup. 🤦🏼‍♂️
"World's greatest?" Such humility? And this, sir, is chili con carne with frijoles. Not nearly enough spices.
No garlic and over beaned.
way too many beans for my liking
Thank you for showing us that thank you for your time thank you for everything you do just thank you so much
Looks delicious 😋
To Serve Man. It's a cookbook!
You don’t drain it? Crazy
Thanks 👍🏼
Thank you fou for your thick chillies recepie
Idk why Mexicans here in Mexico dont eat chilly dogs😢...ama have to make my own!!u forgot the vinager jalapenos😁..jk
I totally agree with you on adding black beans 🫘!!! Thank you for sharing :) Great job 👏
It’s all great recipe but I’ve always wondered why it is called chilli? 😅
I’ll try the black beans next time everything else I added  I used kidney beans btw  I used rotel and Passata too
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE A SUGGETION TO PUT THE BACKGROUND "MUSIC" LOWER THAT WAY WE CAN PAY ATTENTION TO YOU NOT TO THE MUSIC. THANK YOU.
No black beans
I always cook the mince separate and drain it then add it to the chilli. The amount of fat after draining is quite shocking.. It's like a pool of lard. You don't want to have that in you.
looks great but add you meat later its much more tender if you do✌️
And why is there no mention  of cheddar cheese topping?oh well 😂
Can u make it in a crockpot?
Im 50 something years old and this will be my first time in my life to make chili beans and rice. I love that recipe.
Red beans only +sweet peppers, garlic!, lots of onion, fresh tomatoes + canned tomatoes. Salt, sugar, black pepper, cumin.
Chili co carne not chili con frojoles. Beans have no place in a goo pot of chili
Liked this vid because it was short and simple! Thanks
No tomato paste?
“World’s Greatest”….. 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Bro how is that chilli powder black?
I thought this video was excellent AND perfect. I searched for quick, easy chili, and you delivered. You have my sympathy for the idiotic comments made by those who "didn't get it"...too bad.
I stead of water use beef stock
Gotta say, just tried out this recipe because I saw it was a quick video and i had signed up for a Chilli competition with my office lol. Well, day before the competition and i just made your recipe. I gotta say, this is some damn good chilli. Thanks for the recipe!
People coming on here to talk smack should get a reality check, you’re on YouTube for cooking and then act like experts in the comments when you disagree. Clown show.
What was the last ingredients yoi added in bottle .couldn't hear thanks
Can someone put resipe up please ❤
I added to much water, to it doesnt say how long to cook for so I added flour to it after about hour half I ate food taste funny must put to much flour
We're is the recipe and ingredients located ??
More Tomato ............... Less water
Nope
Once I saw the added water I was out 😂
U mean 3 onions??
Definitely not texas chili
No.
Do you drain the can of beans
Just made this. So nice, it was lovey dovey.  You do have to be patient to let it cook down. May take 20 minutes. But, you can taste test it along the way. I was not going to add the hot sauce but that was the kicker. Love this recipe.
The black beans ruined it. It does not look appealing
How much water and how long do you simmer it?
Very basic recipe nowhere near the world’s best..
Plz don't add water. Use a broth
Can it be fresh tomatoes? 🥫➡️🍅🟰❤️
Looks delicious!!!  😊😊😊
I do it Boricua style I add adobo sofrito and sazon😅
Where is the recipe?
You lost me at tomato’s. I cook venison chili yearly and it’s so good.
This guy put Tabasco in there? Whitest chili ever
Oooo that looks really good, I also prefer thick chili, so thank you for showing how it’s made😊 I wanna make some chili for a church menu so I’m looking around! Here is some good news for you!  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; and that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:” ‭‭1 Corinthians‬ ‭15‬:‭3‬-‭4‬ ‭KJV‬‬  “and brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved? And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.” ‭‭Acts‬ ‭16‬:‭30‬-‭31‬ ‭KJV‬‬❤
Was the fat drained off the meat ?
Looks good!
Na… you lost me when you didn’t drain the ground beef
Wait don't you need to drain the hamburger grease???
How many ounces were each of the black bean cans?  Also how much water was added?
No beef stock cubes or MSG.
I love Turkey chilli best, so I will substitute  the meat  W/ turkey. I appreciate  this video,  thank you. I will also add some other beans. .
This doesn’t look good at all.
Pro tip: add cold water and corn starch a little at a time if chilli is not thick enough. Otherwise awesome quick recipe!
Cooking with water is white people sht; replace the water with beef stock 👌🏽
I use onion and green pepper.  I like three cans of beans with black,pinto, and kidney.
This look like white boi chilli with no seasoning😢
ain't no way that was 1 pound of beef.
mmm thicc chili...x
I made mine in the crockpot, but I did use tomato sauce and a little bit of water 😊
Great recipe and easy to make! Thank you!
This is so far away from the worlds greatest chilli recipe
Is it necessary to rinse and drain the cans of black beans? I can't wait to try this, but I want to make sure I do it right.
I did this with venison and ground beef!
Why are you making Con carny not chili
Where is the chilli in it??? I thought they add real chillli in it😢
Olive oil? No. A third of what size onion? Hamburger on top of the onions. Right. That way it will never brown and develop flavor. Grey tasteless meat. That wasn’t even a teaspoon of chili powder let alone 2 tablespoons. Water? Not beef or chicken stock? Never call your junk worlds best. That’s arrogant beyond belief. This small pot mess isn’t even beginning to be chili. It’s just a random mess and you have the arrogance to call it Worlds Best?  This was a joke right? Just to get a laugh? Wow!
meat needs to be simmered before adding onions, you carmelised onions first, then added mince which released their juice and made your whole thing into a wet goo
Terrible recipe😢
I just tried making it his today and it is absolutely delicious!! Thank you for the quick recipe.
GONNA MAKE IT
I just made this yesterday. So good and so easy.
Beef broth and tomato paste are good too instead of the water
Great recipe great song
How sad is it that you have to resort to bottled water to cook with
idk its like soup
I'd gladly use blackbeans instead of kidney.
Dawg can I use 1 half oinion....2cups guppy sauce
Chili ruined by the black beans :D
Next time I suggest…drain the meat and wash the beans
So many beans!!! I can imagine the smell
Thanks for good recipe
dude, You should rinse and drain your Beans... o.o
How about paper and celery?
Ugggh.... NO
I just want to know how long it takes for the water to thicken
What,no garlic?
That looks terrible
😬
Water? Why not beef stock?
How much water do you add?
So the world's greatest chilli flavour comes from a third of an onion (chopped and sweated), 1 can of chopped tomatoes, 1 tsp cumin, 1 tsp cayenne chilli powder, a tiny amount of black pepper, 1 tbsp salt, 2 tbsp chilli powder and a few dashes of tobasco?  Bruh... no.
Single dad here. I like simple, cheap, and short video recipes as to obviously I’m like every other American right now just trying to make it until the next check. Costs me about 15 bucks for everything I needed and it’s sooooo good. I ate it all day today and got a nice bowl for work when I go back. And this might be my recipe for chili from here on out.
What's that sauce he added after adding water?
It was delightful yummy
U just earned yourself a new and happy subscriber  Thank you🙏God bless
music in the background is unnecessary and distracting to those of us who are hard of hearing ... a great chili tutorial!
dont know what your putting in the pot
Great Chilli, thank you for this recipe
Lost me at the beans..   What the Fuck man
I might cook this today for my family but i'm gonna make it different kind of
instead of putting in water, I use a 12 ounce can of diced tomatoes and a 12 ounce can of pasta sauce.
nice
Instead of salt I add a beef stock cube which helps give a rich thick texture.
Too many beans
wait he didnt drain the beans?
Thank you, easy instruction

🤣 My God have mercy! 🤦‍♂️
Bhro .... Where the F is the Beef Stock?
No se por que no escriben los ingredientes en español.,veo que usan granis negros,
Great easy recipe.  I always put bell pepper in mine and a couple cloves minced garlic but otherwise your recipe is pretty much right along with mine.  Thanks for the ease of it all!
For My fellow Indians/South Indians watching n thinking abt the proportions. Its 3 big Onions(Vengayam), 4 big tomatoes(Takkaali) and 3 Tbsps of chilly powder(Mollaga podi).
Can’t we add a little ginger & garlic
Just made it! Amazing. To be fair, I took the base ideas of the chili then made it work for what I had in the kitchen: 500g of mince, 2 small onions, 0.5 green + 0.5 red pepper, 1 tin black beans, 1 tin kidney beans, 0.5 can tomato puree, 2 small diced tomatoes, Tip of a teaspoon of garlic, BBQ spices to dry marinate the mince, Assorted curry powders to taste (especially for the broth, instead of just water), etc.  Served with "crispy" roasted sweet and regular potatoes and white rice.  Thanks a bunch!
It looks great I have to try these. thank you 🙏
Good soup! Thank you!
That's only like a teaspoon of salt and chili powder
Never ever add water. You use beer
Greatest? Greatness is subjective. A third of an onion? Next.
I would add 2 tins of tomatoes rather than water
Why is there less of chili and more of beans
I love it looks so good yummy
Use chicken or beef broth instead of water and add one can of V8 juice. Just another option!😊
Pretty close to mine , but I usualy do another can of any kind of maters n juice , garlic , 2 cans chili beans in sauce , 1 can black or dark red kidney beans. Make how ya want but you cant go wrong based off this here. Thanks for sharing.
. . . never ever do the minced meat into the onions - because it isn't roasted then (it is simply cooked in liquid of the onions then ) . . . as you can see here the meat isn't brown, it is grey . . .
That looks so easy
Terrible runniest chilli soup brah beef broth not water and tomato paste and diced tomatoes and a Lil brown sugar with your bland ass cooking !!!I would try the black beans though
Simple everything is so much simpler when a man explains it even fuckn cooking.
Nope………
Thx guys I took ALL the suggestions in the comments .  First time ever trying my hand at chili. It was great!
Stop it with the World's Greatest Chili! Are you a Master Chef????
Ñooooo😑
Thank you, simple dishes like this is nice to have short videos
You didn’t drain the beef and onions also the kidney beans. You need to add tomato purée and don’t add a pint of water. Probably the worst chilli con carne I’ve seen
Can you use watered down tomato soup instead of water?
How long do you cook it  for?
Love the music!
Wait u didn’t put cans of chili in there , I follow the whole time and now I’m confused idk if I’m suppose to use these cans 🤣
Suffering succotash
For the amount of meat you definitely need more seasoning!
why do you call it chili?
How much water was that?
You need to list ingredients & other instructions in your description. I don't like to stop/pause, rwd vids to get the recipe!
What are the timings? Brown for 5 min? Simmer for 1 hour?
Yummmy I don’t like kidney beans definitely using your recipe tyvm for sharing
No sir!  I do not cook mine w water
worlds GREATEST ?  with ground beef   !!   NO  WUCKING  FAY   ! .
So you are telling me you don't add chilli in there? Why is it called chilli then, I'm just asking out of curiosity
Thank you!!! Love the recipe !!!!! I also loved that you went straight into the cooking.. I don’t like when people ramble on about other things..  thank you again great job!!   I’m cooking chili rite now…..( your recipe)…
Yes , you need garlic,  good easy recipe 😋
I cook 5 pieces of thick cut bacon in a cast iron pan, then brown pork ribs, beef short ribs, then ground chuck 80/20 , ground pork.  blend onion, green and red bell peppers, 3 stocks celery and cilantro stems. Cook sofrito(blended vegetables) at medium heat add my seasonings which include cumin,  smoked paprika,  cayenne pepper a dash of nut megan and of course salt and pepper. Add 1 small can tomato paste(cook off) and then add meat, 1 can beef broth and half cup water and 1 large can Cento crushed tomatoes Let simmer for 4-6 hours and then pull any bones put before serving.
Guess I just don’t know how long you boil it for lol
This is for white people
Thank you!!  About a third of the ingredients and trouble as other chili videos on YT and still yummy.  Who has the time? ha.
It is like rajma with beef/chicken
Foghorn Leghorn says “ Aye Aye say Aye say looks like some mighty fine eatin, burpin , and fahtin to me son ! “
its just chili its not rocket sience ...
U had a video about athletes food, and ur felling us how to make chili 🤢
Mn
Put corn chips in your chili. Your taste  buds will tap dance.
Dude cant cook
Chili with beans is one of my favorite food........new subscriber
Shelf life?
i love basic chili… meat, onions and beans basically. no peppers, this or that 😊
My chilli looks nothing like that 😬
Black beans is that salted?
No.  Just no.
Bro... drain the grease...
I stopped watching the video as soon as I  Seen the ground beef not being drained.
Thank you for the video it was simple and quick 👌🏿👌🏿👌🏿👌🏿👌🏿👌🏿👌🏿👌🏿👌🏿
Why the name "chili" ?
I just finished a pot of this chili. It turned out great. I will be freeze drying it, I used a different bean, I use ranch style beans. I added tomato paste for the extra tomato taste. Loved this easy recipe.
God bless 🙏🏾
Neither beans nor tomatoes belong in chili.  and black beans don't even go with chili as a side.  The recipe shown here is a spicy stew.  Heck, he's even using fine ground hamburger. Might be a nice (except for the black beans)stew, but it is NOT chili.
Learn to cook because you very clearly can't cook , worlds best ?????? Probably can't even tie your shoelaces.
Instead of chili powder I'm gonna use a Carolina reaper, that'll suffise, right?
I am your 1 thousand comment.
Yummy !!
I just made this tonight for the third time and it was a hit with my kids.  Made it as Chilli and cheese with fries and they want it again tomorrow.  Thanks
I prefer not to use onion,  in the chilli  con carne but red kidney beans and mince with grated cheddar cheese on top and sour cream.
That's weird... Recipe for a dish called chilli but barely any chillies inside lol.
as an Indian, there is nothing "chilli " about this stew!
bay leaves
Soo delicious ty
Yes,😊to most comments; good! Albeit missing my ingredients! (In mine..also....  Add}:~Red, Yellow, Orange, Green Bell Peppers/Passata/Home dried Chilli(from fresh)&...... ! Dark 70%Chocolate;😋 to taste(experiment)!!  As all spiced food:~so much better if frozen,then cooked!  If you want more intense flavour add 'beef oxo' & dash or 2 of 'Worcester Sauce' & teaspoon of 'Marmite'(or Veggie substitute).  Try it & you can decide with differing measures of ingredients.😁'Happy  Suppertime'! Rosie🦓 (Stay🦋safe ALL)
Looks good. Try using beef or chicken stock in place of the water next time though (preferably homemade).
Unimpressive. Pedestrian.
Very notenticing !
Simple And basic. Boom boom done!  Some love to read you a novel  before they go to step 1.
I put beer instead water
I need to try this never made home made chilli before
I submitted ground beef for Cubed Pork!
Making this right now, thank you
Thumbs up if this reminded you of Kevin's Chillies from The Office 😂
Ugh NO
Thank you so much this is the very first video I've ever referred to the very first time that I've ever made chili and I keep coming back to the same video thank you again
I guess I'm the only guy whose watching this so that he can make some chilli fries
How long do you cook it for?
AWESOME RECIPE MAN THANK YOU SOOOO MUCH. I have never made chilli before and my mom asked me if I could make some with our ground beef, so I found this, and I didn't follow the recipe "exactly" but just put in whatever spices we had that seemed like they would taste good...... My 6 yr/o brother LOVED it. Thank you so much for bringing us this recipe!
TELL YOU WHAT ITS BETTER WITH RICE👌👌
Easy and delicious!! Try adding green red and yellow bell peppers, celery, lots of parsley and cilantro and a chopped sausage...to die for! Greetings from Chile
Also never use water use beef stock. That's gonna be a flavorless chili if you put water in it
Why beans. Chili doesn't have beans
One of the few recipes that is entitled "easy" and doesnt involve 50,000 ingredients, thanks ill try this
Menuda caca.
I want chili!!!
Dayum! When i grow up i will start making this!
Im gonna try this
Love this simple recipe! I didn't have cumin or tomatoes, so instead I substituted garlic powder and a can of Amy's chunky tomato bisque. It came out delicious! 👍👍
u dont wash ur beans and drain them wtf?
I will add jalapeno's and cream cheese
Enna kandravi Saar ithe
Beef broth instead of the water people
Used your directions with red kidney beans and tweaks on the seasoning amounts and it tastes great.  You're right, it will definitely thicken up and I love thick chili.
wow, a whole third of an onion...
Water why weaken it with water ! I would use tomato juice instead !
Forgot to say how long do you cook it for?
Cook time?
I stopped watching this video the second you added those canned beans, how the hell can you call it the greatest chili with canned beans????????? 😖
Chili it meses with me
Check out Go Big or Go Home  Chili
Am I the only person that loves a saucy, less viscous base. 😋
This so Hood
Beef chili recipe... seriously...there was hardly any real chili to it...#@*???
nope. just nope.
Yummy looks so delicious!😍
It's two waterie
Ben Askrens makin chili
Mad this twice now And it’s easy and amazing ❤️
Made for my family.  They licked the bowls and complained that I didn’t make enough. 😃
You forgot garlic
Can tomato's👎can beans👎 i eat with my eye's👎 thanks for nothing
Gave it 20 seconds !!
Is anice and easy recipe. good job
👍🏻👍🏻
did you drain the beans?
Looks delicious, the only thing I would do different is add celery.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!
Who taught you how to dice onions? This recipe is garbage! You might as well have just opened up a can of chili! I hope you keep a candle lit after eating all of those beans!
It would be nice if he mentioned timings (or at least estimated them)
I use a bottle of Belgian beer instead of water. It's delicious!
Real, authentic chili has no beans or tomatoes...
Can someone tell me how long would it take to make this dish? Need to know what time to start. Thanks.
Is there an option to choose the type of meat we are using? Can we use chicken or go for a vegetarian option?
My recipe is sooo much better sorry each to their own x
instead of water i would use beefstock and a bayleaf
There is a grand total of 195 sovereign states in the world… So this Chili beat out 195 countries. Wow that is impressive
I hate to brag but I can put that chili to shame, just brown your ground beef, I like to use a George Foreman grill and press all the grease out of it while turning it 2-4 times then I put the beef in some water to cool and work it up with my hands until it looks like crumbs, then I microwave some finely diced peppers and onions it doesn't matter just whatever kind you want until soft, stirring occasionally until soft usually around 12 minutes, add to beef, long with a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes along with your chili seasoning mix and your beans and you have chili and it might not hurt to ad 1 small can of tomato sauce and with the George Foreman grill there's practically no fat versus this other recipe on YouTube.
There is no "best" or "greatest," so don't criticize the guy for making a video of HIS *favorite*. To HIM it's the "greatest." This makes a fine chili, but I would simply change one thing: Brown the meat first and drain off the grease. Unless you're using a VERY lean ground beef, the fat that renders from browning will make the chili greasy. I like to brown the meat, drain the grease, then add my onion and continue seasoning the meat. Otherwise, this is an excellent way to make a delicious chili quick and easy. Thanks!
Looks like mierda
Well, let's make chili I'm hungry
That looks good. I left work and stopped by target got some ground beef. I made my first chilli soup today. Thanks to you.
VERY GOOD. As for the amount of seasoning  I usually add a little bit more. BUT OVER ALL BRAVO !!!!
Old video but your hamburger is literally reduced to Taco meat. No1 wants a tiny shredded meat in Chili. Best to go bigger and heartier chunks. Clicked off, no sub, won't be back.
Awesome recipe, thanks for the share!
Broth instead of water makes it better
Talkin about flavor!? Dont use water. Use tomato juice or beef broth/stock
It's very good. Thank you 😊
WORLD'S greatest? Whose world?
There is more salt than spices in this, no garlic and shit loads of water. It must be so bland.
Ok I don't get it. All those ingredients, why settle on naming it Chili? It seems to be more like a very mildly spicy bean stew. Still looks yum though
Tried this recipe today and it's amazing! I reccomend this to everyone 👌😄
Water???
Thx you dat all I got to say ,🤟😂
😬 that looks not so good tbh
You didn't drain the grease yo after cooking the meat, Nor did you add any tomato or chili paste or chicken bouillon, no broth, I can go on and on with the stuff you missed yo. 👎 waste of my fucking time watching this.   How tha fuck this get so many views!?
Add tomato paste instead of water. That’s what everyone else does lmao. And plus too much beanssssss or maybe just me
does chilli with chicken/mutton mince disgust anyone?
Strain the beans and rince them
So yummy!!!!!!!!
Ui Gehakt Tomaten Bonen Knoflook Caijene peper zout peper  Chili poeder Water Hete saus  Uit laten koken
There so many ingredients missing.
Seemed too watery.
seems ok apart from the huge amount of water you added!! that is really not necessary
or a large fresh chili??
Beans have a punch? Ehhh next video
That's a nice looking bowl of chili ya got there young fella. But you forgot something. You forgot to rinse the beans. Even when beans are coming out of a can they need to be rinsed. Beans are a natural source of soaps suds. You'll see the foam as you rinse.  If they're not rinsed your teeth will feel like they're wearing fuzzy sweaters.
I like to add a spoon of cocoa powder to my chili, and it turned out great with this one!
A recipe that is actually easy to follow. Thank you sir
chill
Instead of water add chicken stock and beef stock and add I boulon cube tomato paste I also add a little ground mustard and cook the beef in bacon grease for more flavor
Ewww.
Mouth watering.. 🤤🤤🤤
Done this 2 times and is so dam good must try
that was one flashy intro lol nice
You'd have to use extra lean ground beef for your recipe, you did not drain off any fat.
Nar sorry that's not the worlds best chillie
I just made this, and it IS SO GOOD! Kid pleaser!!! If its a kid pleaser it is forsure a winner. Thank you for sharing!
Is it ok if I user organic tomatoes not canned?
Thank you very much.  It turned out very well.
nice
Your Voice is Zaddy
Can u make without ground beef and just beans
I add chili beans and black beans,  better favorite
The thing that I would love to know is why it's called chili when there's hardly any chilli used.
I am not a beef eater, so how much shredded chicken do you suggest I use?  Still 1 pound? To my "dead taste buds" There is never enough pepper or splices, how strict are the measurements to follow?  I mean, to add "to taste" is not the same as "daily allowances."
I made a huge pot of this and it was a big hit with my three boys. They made me make more of it! Great stuff!
I love your recipe and use it at least twice a month
I wonder how long it actually takes to cook
Thicc
I am going to amaze my friends and family
Nah!
worlds greatest chili? you must be from new york
I was out here thinking I could go get some salt, pepper, onions and water and put it on the stove *boom* chili ready
You didn’t show the names of the spices. I am assuming cumin is one.
EXCELLENT AN ENJOYABLE WATCH!!! NEW SUBSCRIBER!!!✌✌✌
Add rice and hot links mmmmmm
As a purist bean don't  belong in chili. First time I saw beans in the chili it came from N.Y. not from the SW US.
cmon man cut the Tomatos and Onions smaller dont that much water and will dont look like Tex Mex Shit
I dont have ground beef though
An actual recipe video in under 3:00 minutes????..... Subscribed👍👍
No garlic powder no white pepper!?
Chili with beans is one of my favorite foods, EVER!!! In Texas we fix it with beans. My chili is not over cooked. It’s all done in within 60 minutes, basically cooking time for browning meat and bean cooking time. I DO NOT use anything canned!
When I make my chili I’m boring so I just but in beans and ground beef already made and then I put in seasoning and a lotttt of hot sauce
Canned tomatoes, canned beans, no fresh myriad of peppers, no cumin far from world's greatest chili.
You said yall would "greatly appreciate it" NO I APPRECIATE YOU! ❤ I have all of these ingredients but needed a bit more guidance and you made it so simple for me to understand! Thank u! 💜👌🏽
Can I use kidney bean instead of black bean?
Thanks I never added water and. Also put in crockpot
You must under cook the onions       And you sound like Toby
Chile con carne green or red referring to a spiced stew of ground beef and minced chiles and other ingredients beef or pork stew or sauce garlic, green tomatillos, and roasted green chiles poblano, jalapeño, serrano, and occasionally habanero.  Vegetarian Chile stew contain corn, squash, sautéed mushrooms, pearl onions, shallots or beets.  Dish served in the cantinas of northern Mexico as an ordinary meal without cultural significance, which was accompanied by the beer they sold there. Sources assure that it originated in the cantinas of the northern of the country popular meal amongst poor and Mexican cowboys. Its name arises from the most relevant component in the preparation "chili", since when consumed in Texas by the North Americans the inability of the North Americans to distinguish another flavor besides the hotness of the chili, made them generically call everything "chili." they do not have a differential difference in all the ingredients of the preparation, but rather, they remained in the sensation of itchiness produced by the chile coming to popularize the dish as simply "chili". Chili was occasionally criticized for its unusual and for many unpleasant aspects, so it was finally said that this was not a Mexican dish since Mexican cuisine would not have something of such low quality, however, North Americans did they welcomed and gave it the value it deserved. And it is that while for many it does not deserve to be within the repertoire of Mexican food, for others, especially for foreigners, it is a true Mexican delicacy. It was during the Mexican Revolution when the controversy over the origin of chili became more heated.  Many capitals came to Texas fleeing the armed conflict and with them their "educated" palates. When trying the "chili con carne", food of the poor and of doubtful reputation, the defenders immediately affirmed that such an unpleasant mixture could not be of Mexican origin. This, together with various health campaigns promoted by the San Antonio government that condemned chili as a dirty food. At the beginning of the 20th century, “chili”, due to its bad reputation, became a dangerous food, exclusively consumed by the “males”, and the protagonist of the “Cook off” of the cowboys. Chili became a risky sport, causing local government efforts to be insufficient for chili to lose popularity. Its origin is undoubtedly debatable, and that is that the history of chili is related to the political and military history of Mexico, to the relations between our country and its neighbor to the north and the impossibility of separating the cultural roots of two communities that a day were the same.
It look delicious 😁
I love the music lol
l0
Made this today but added one can of black beans and one can of red kidney beans. I also added in Adobo powder, sugar, paprika, and garlic powder. Then I added in a bit of Frank’s Red Hot and a bit of Sriracha! It was amazing!
Uhhhhh why did he put everything straight from the cans ? Ew
Drain the beans !!!
That’s beans’n’meat salad. That ain’t chili sir
That is a pedestrian chili recipe. Move along folks...nothing to see here
Many thanks for outlining the general procedure - much appreciated
I've made hundreds of batches of chili over the years,  never the same way twice. Never with black beans though..maybe I will try it sometime. I usually do it in the crockpot
Put a thumb sizes piece of 70%+ cocoa dark chocolate in there too!
What a nice video. What a cool dude.
Great video, Thanks 😊
So you just leave all that hamburger grease in there🤔
i makeing a big pot i love chili alot
thats looks so good i getting ready to makeing some thank you for shareing
Greasy
Everything was great .  but from where did u buy your onions??.. That onion must be the size of a football !
Shouldnt you cook the beef and drain it then add it to spiced sweated onions?
Chili doesn't have tomatoes or beans. Come now.
Thank you!!! Simple, sweet and to the point!! Just what a Mama of a toddler needs when making a meal. 😊 thank you again
👍🎥Short 2 the point & good, tks.
You don't use beans in a chilli con carne recipe. Fake! So sad!
To thicken it, you know you can just add in like a tablespoon of cornstarch or flour and it will magically thicken
Thku for this easy and delicious recipie. I just made it 4 ny neighbbir and I. She liked it n so did I. Gb❤
Yuck
I used beef broth and a can of good beer in place of water turned out amazing
Helpful tip, chili powder already contains: cumin, onion powder, garlic powder, oregano, paprika, and cayenne.  Sooo, why add cumin and cayenne separately and then add chili powder which already has those same ingredients?  Learn your ingredients.  That separates an amateur vs a real cook.  Real chili chefs never use chili powder..it’s a newbie move.  Just add the same ingredients that make up chili powder. Just saying mate.  Trying to help you...don’t shoot the messenger.
🤩
2 cans of kidney beans?
There is no right or wrong. As i understand it, this was invented before refrigderation. Meat started rotting in the climate, hence the hour-long cookingtime to kill parasites/bacteria, cumin/chilli/cayenne were in place to make up for the sometimes putrid smell. Back then, making things edible was the only requirement to claim sucessful cooking.....there was no grand masterplan behind the recipe imo
This is basic as hell. I'm sure it tastes good, but it's absurd that a recipe that skips all of the fundamentals would be world-class.
the fact they call it chilli but that ingredient is lesser than others.
Why are there so many youtube recipe videos but they don't list the recipe.....
Dice the onion nicely XD
Too much water bruh use beef stock
No, no no , this is white people chili, no no, call it what it is shitti.
More BEANS
What did u say when u said something sauce I didn’t hear it I don’t understand what u said
Loved this, ty
Ya didn’t drain the grease from your burger......yikes
Love this recipe my all time favourite wendys chilli
That was nowhere near enough chili powder.
It seems crazy to me when people don't drain the fat from the meat.  Death chili!
DAMN BOY this chilli THICCCC
Lost me with black beans yuky
Straight to the point. Love this thank you
Looked good until all that water! W
Does anyone else add a can of baked beans when cooking chilli, or is my mom the only one?
What do you eat it with? Looks good
Black beans? Wow...i like!
Kevin makes the best chili.
A few shakes of salt should be enough, the chilli would be ruined if you added a tablespoon of salt.
It can't be the best it dosen't taste like mine.
can i add some hot peppers? if so would i add it with onion?
I'm from the south so its weird to me that he used black beans abd not kidney beans and that he added water bc I've never done that
Looks delicious...but its not chili if you add beans.
he like it thiccky like it fat yuh
MY MOM HAS MADE THE BEST RECIPE FOR CHILI AND IF ANYONE WANTS THE RECIPE WILL BE HAPPY TO GIVE IT BUT ONLY IF ANYONE WANTS THE RECIPE
You don’t drain the fat off the hamberg maybe some beef bioum cubes and pinto beans good luck with that sorry
Can i come to your house and eat that?  👍
Delicious.💛❤🧡💜💙💚
Aren’t we supposed to drain the fat ?
Now to this..you add...4 Goodyear tires. 6 red bricks. 3 green frog's,  1 water Buffalo butt, 1 possum,  and 1 oak tree.  Stir for 6 days and serve on year old horse blanket....now that is cooking at its finest  at the lunch room in high school....yummy!....there are so many way to do chili..I let some other fool do it...and mouch off them for a meal....lol
This is perfect! All the instructions in less than 3 minutes, straight to the point, quick and easy, and exactly what I was looking for. THANK YOU!
Just made some awesome chili. I may make this on a regular basis now.
I never add water. Tomato juice or V-8 juice. I hardly never add water to anything l cook.
Yeah, black beans suck.
You don't put water in chili, you doughnut!!
9
Nope. You definitely should have drained the meat..
I am a vegetarian ..... But every time before I make my veg chilli   i watch this video. I add bell pepper s and carrots.
Wow
Did you win a local contest?
It looks delicious thanks for sharing
It was very good of you to give us permission to use a little less salt if we want.
Lost me at beans
No beans
Not chili does not have beans
Not even any tomato sauce?
No recipe...…..Why ???
Drain the oil after the hamburger meat cooks
Perhaps use half the water and simmer it less...no?
This recipe so far the best so far easy delicious hearty and I don't think I'm going to change too much in the recipe because that's what I Google eight easy chili recipe. The only thing I think I'm going to do it which I usually don't add black beans I'm going to have black beans and I think it said of water I'm going to add some chicken broth and. And some of the comments I see they said at chili ketchup and ketchup and green pepper supposed to be a basic easy chili recipe and that's what I'm going to stick to it the recipe as close as possible....... Just saying LOL I think this is the best recipe so far but I can't wait to try it that's all I'm saying thanks.👍👍👍👍👍😊
This man really put water in his chili......
Chilli with no chilli?
Beans in Chile, that looks more like Bean soup.
Chucky is watching you cook chili from the ceiling  *Smiling*🤫
I always season the meat before tossing it in the pot. It makes a world of difference.
Wtf, you havent spent the night before pressing garlic. Youre not very serious about this stuff
You did not rinse the beans, black beans or other, that will give them more punch if you know what I mean!
Looks really delicious and I would love to try your recipe, can you please give exact measurements of the ingredients you added. Thank you. 😉
I will try this recipe, thx for sharing!  --> I have tested it today and I liked it very much. Its a very good recipe! Love it👍  What i needed; - Olive Oil  - half a Onion - Ground Meat 1 pound (450 gram) - Canned Tomato 24 0z (0.7 liters) - Black Beans 2x 260 grams - 1 Teespoon Cumin - 1 Teespoon Cayenne Pepper - 1 Teespoon Salt - Littel bit pepper - 2 Teespoon chillipowder  - Some Tabasco sauce  I made twice as much and had enough for 4 person. Took me 1h 30min to finish but had lot of water in my tomatos so it needed to cook long.
Add ground sausage to this, you will be surprised how good it is
Best chili I ever made stated with a pack of “Pecos Red” I’ll never use anything else. Rich and spicy 🌶 I
Quick, easy, real, thanks
Instead of adding water, add beef stock,,  😁🖒
My guess is you must be from a Northern state.
Publix !!!
垃圾 LOL
i'm thinking of adding a human head in my chili.
I made this tonight i used a big onion you csn never use too much onion lol i used more then amount of seasoning here except salt i used less but i used 3 spoons of cumin and like 4 spoons of chilli powder and 2 spoons cayenne pepper. I found it needed more flavor then recommended but it come out good. I made a corn bread to go with it.
I'll have to try adding black beans. Thanks.
You had me till the black beans
That looks like Gringo Chile
It's sooooo  easy
putting everything together and heat it up this is what i do when i knew nothing about cocking
Does baked bean work?
Oddly enough with Stews & Chilis whenever it says to add water I sub it out with V8 juice, which was a trick my friends Mom taught me and it works well
Did you drain the tomatoes? The juice adds to the flavour. Also I'd suggest adding more her s with the onions, and use fish sauce, soy sauce and sherry to reduce heat before browning the beef.
The trick is to undercook the onion.
No garlic?
Water??! No
Water is flavorless; try beer for a deeper flavor profile👍
Onion 1/3 - oil - ground beef - tomatoes - beans - tsp cumin - Cayenne - black pepper - salt - 3 tbsp chili - 2 tsp sugar -
I've never cooked chili before, but I thought this was pretty straightforward.  So I tried it. (While taking abit of the advice from the comments) _I love it!_ Thank youu!
Bahahhaha Publix
Add g fuel and make it caffeinated chilli
Try adding 1 can of Chili beans along with a can of Kidney beans instead.
Add 1/2 cup brown sugar, you won't be disappointed!
Quick question can you use canned butter beans
Instead of water try V8 also I like sliced Jalapenos in there!
Oh I didn't know that Chilli needs ground beef... now I don't think I want to cook chilli
Who seasons cooked beef...
Who else is eating chili while watching a chili video?
Is it better than Wendy's chilli? IMO, that is a gold standard when chilli is concerned.
No
Perfect!! Thanks.
Water? Why not stock? Beef, chicken, or vegetable?
A third of an onion!? How big was the onion?!
It will be nice to add some tomato paste too. But over all great! Thanks lot.
Thank you
add some curry powder too!
thx a lot, like in Germany straight to the point. Thx again!
I am from Chile and I love hot Chile with beans and cheese.
Wtf is a little bit for a measurement? Lol at least put ingredient measurements in the description below so we don't have to guess what your little bit measurement is.
Can fresh tomatoes be used instead of canned?
Cool music.
you can add a little flour or cornstarch to thicken
Gotta have green pepper.
Fucking gross
Thank you!! This recipe it’s so easy and yummy. Will share
pinto and kidney beans are for chili...not black beans...put some tomato puree or sauce... instead of water... this looks awful...bleck...sorry
Without garlic it’s not chili soup...
Yummmmmmmmm
I hope this will kill me
I'll be the judge or bad if it's good
Should of rinsed the kidney beans first it can make the recipe to salty and starchy.
That’s chili soup
Probably cost a least 200 dollars to just to get the chili stains off the walls.
Awesome 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Does anyone else add corn to their chili
Hillbilly food, cheap and easy.
This is the worst chili recipe I have ever seen!!!
Olive oil...
KOOMIN
Looks delicious going 2 make this maybe today or 2morro. In dying for some chili just saying LOL
Water?!?!?!?!! Noooooo
Ok. Tried it out. Turned out great. Thank you.
no garlic? coriander?
Cool recipe! I make chili in a variety of ways. Usually I add chili beans and kidney beans. I like to puree yellow and orange bell peppers and I add them to the onion and ground beef. (I do this with my meatloaf too.)   Sometimes I even add V8 juice to my chili and it gives it a whole other flavor.
I liked this video based on it's simplisity. No bs straight up cookin
Try corn oil instead of olive oil, and beer instead of water.  If you would like to try a truly thick chili, mix masa flour with that beer and slowly incorporate.
Replace the water with beer for much better chili.
To get it nice and chick I always add a little Masa
Real chili made with brisket.
Great video work, love the simplicity of the presentation. Nice Job!
oh yeah yeah
Your chili looks like my shit when I got diarrhea.
so it is basic mexicana with added beans and stronger spice ?
Do you have to have cumin?
Ate your chili tonight.   Good stuff.
this ain't nothing but yankee red rattle.
Best chili is when you eat it the next day 😉 Thanks for sharing -that looks tasty‼️🍃🌺🍃
Looks delicious I’ll be having some soon
The 70s porn music is off putting.
That's not Chile, thats bean soup.
That's NOT Chili! Chili does NOT contain fking beans!
Easy. Quick & simple. Thank you.
What if I omit the beef part?
GOOD JOB ...I start with onions and bacon (lard), masa flour, chopped pablano's, chili powder, cumin, epazote' garlic, bell pepper and habaneros to taste (mash some of the black beans) ...NOW, do one on potato salad
Super easy.  Thanks!   Edit: Not Only is this simple, but the chili turned out absolutely amazing! Thanks again
For the purists Chile is a sauce without other in ingredients. It's like a soup. It's made with chiles colorado.
Hate to tell you dude...but you don’t know chili.
If you're using fatty beef plz drain, I always use lean
Garbage. You making soup?
The way you said thick made me uncomfortable
We always fry our hamburger separately in a pan so we can drain the grease out. I think it is healthier that way.... just saying.
Stop Criticising his recipe.. My wife is Puerto Rican & We prepare this Dish in Boriqua fashion...Which isn't similar to Dominican and Mexican formula.. Then as for Puerto Ricans are concerned.. The recipe differ from family to families.. This version that he prepared using Black Bean's.. We also use the same Beans instead of Red Kidney beans.... I'm residing in Germany and Hungarian Goulash isn't same like German Goulash.. I'm not here to patronise this Guy nor Criticise for using the Term World 🌍 Best.. 😂 That's his own enthusiastic heading.. But his version seem to be decent as well Minus Garlic, Habanero caper & Etc..No 2 individuals are same.. ARE THEY?  Criticising ASS HOLE'S & INTERNET TROLL..
I make the best...I use Kidney beans, pinto beans, black beans...3 bean and ground beef chili.   Cumin, Chili Powder, Salt, black Pepper, Cheyenne Pepper, Onions and Thick Tomato sauce and paste, Also A big pinch of Cilantro.  Yummy!
not impressed with this chili recipe at all.   it has missed the boat completely.  there are several other spices needed to make a great chili and there are no beans or tomatoes in real chili.
Thank you!!
Well that's not really chilly that's chili con carne which basically made to show off the meat chili is a soup
Looks GROSS:(
Too much water,,,, for God sake.
Hi can beans go in the last 30 minutes of cooking to prevent them from getting all mushy. Try using reconstituted dried chili smoked chili beans. And whenever you can use fresh herbs such as Mexican oregano you might have make sure you have garlic in there
Will definitely try black beans in my chili recipe, thanks.
There is no right or wrong way, but I prefer to brown the meat first and use the fat that comes off to sweat the onions. I think it makes a deeper flavour. That is why I think fattier often cheaper beef is better for chilli.
This Soup
*EXTRA THICC.*
Trash
It bewilders me that people who already know how to cook the best chilli are watching videos on how to cook the best chilli
Umnnnn... where the black people cooking chili at?
Instead of ground beef, try cutting up top sirloin into 1/2 inch squares.  It's so much better to get an actual bite of tender beef.  Bush's also makes Chili Magic in Mild and Medium.  It has most of the needed seasonings in it already and requires less doctoring to get it to where you want it.  I agree with many others that garlic is an important component missing from your chili.  I add 4-5 cloves.
YUM YUM!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Thanks for this simple to follow recipe! Will be making this tonight!
World's BASIC Chili Recipe.
Thats thick????
''I like mine really thick''  same
Better than that Skyline chili-spaghetti trash my family in Cincinnati eats.
World’s greatest chili uses ground beef?  Fuck outta here.
thanks
You've not tried Hestons then.......!
Ewwww....he didn't even drain the fat from hamburger meat......don't think I'm interested in this recipe.
This looks absolutely fucking delicious!
I am not Neil ,      Thank you for making the effort to make this inspiring video , Chilly is one of my favourite dishes . I love how we have the freedom to customise great dishes  , What I do is similar .         I  add tomato  sauce instead of water , I like adding chopped and fried bell peppers and jalapeños , and garlic   , I add peas and carrots  , I like to put both red and black beans in it , sometimes I will put portobello mushrooms in it ,  you do not need any salt  .some times I will add a little red wine in it , I recommend making at least four times the amount you did because everyone loves it . the longer you cook it the better it is , once it has all been fried I cook for at least two hours on low , the longer you cook it the better, even better the next day over night in the fridge if there is any left , I do this all the time and received many compliments . I also like to put a dollop of sour cream on top before serving  ,  ( I use to put corn in it but stooped when GMO became the normal ) , I do not usually serve this on a bed of cooked  rice but  I have which is also a good option. You have inspired me , now I want to make some. ,  You can make someone's day great with a lovely meal . Bonaparte .
By boiling precooked beans, beef, and onions you are diluting all your spices and producing SOUP, not chili. Chili is not supposed to be soup. I use black beans in my chili, as well, but they don't require cooking, they come out of the can ready to eat. The best chili is made in 15 minutes, everything combined and heated to a low simmer just hot enough to serve. Half a cup of your favorite salsa will provide all the heat you need for a four cup chili mix, no cumin or chili powder needed.  I always add a tablespoon of barbeque sauce for a little something different, a little molasses makes it more complex in flavor. Bottom line... DON'T BOIL YOUR CHILI!!
Thank you it looks fantastic
Ew, beans.
Why do you not strain out the liquid that the ground beef made,? Or do you just leave it in for the flavor.?
*zelda oot potion shop music plays*
If it's world's best let's see the paperwork.  Just kiddin.  Nice chili - I'll try it!
The worlds best chili comes from Ben's Chili Bowl in Washington D.C. all celebrities and U.S. Presidents have eating there if you go there just make sure Bill Cosby is sitting near you
If you use a Non Stick Pot, The Chilli will not burn, So you will not have to keep sturing it as it cooks  Thanks for sharing I like your Black Beans in place of the Red Kidney Beans a must try recipe etc.
try  the toronto stars chilli recipe  it won awards  and its great
A tea spoon of salt ? :/ you need waaaaay more than that for a full pot.
1/3 of an onion? Pathetic
Time frames? Kind of cooking blind.
Looks totally wack.
i like the style the chili came out
Way too much water was added, and black beans like REALLY eewe gross. This was by far the worst looking chilli I've seen in a very long while. No green pepper like REALLY. This video was very disappointing to me. I came here looking for a great chilli recipe and in return got a watered down pot of mess that was supposed to be great chilli.
idk, having the beans not rinsed and the meat not drained is a bad example for people who are learning to cook through the internet. for some of us it's just the same as eating with hands,  that's why some of us get triggered by it. and therefore, don't hate on the people that get triggered by it, it's just about health and ethics. not everyone has to drain and rinse, that's just up to you.
Made it today... spiced up a little with extra cumin and chili powder but was delicious!! Thanks
Add a good splash of Worcestershire sauce half way through 😋
Thank you for sharing Sir
i like to kinda toast the chili powder and spices with the onion and meat before adding any of the wet ingredients.
This looks great and all but if someone served me chili and it had onions in it, I think I’d have to leave
How much water do you add
Too loose
I'm not askeert of meat fat, but I would have to drain the fat off that ground beef.
Thanks. Short. Simple. And straight to the point. ✌️🏿🖤💫
Add can of chopped green chilies
Looks like shit. Yuck
Looks good !
Water???   WTF, use beef broth or chicken broth for flavor.   No way this is good chili!!
Put a can of creamed corn and a little bell pepper
By the way you add way too many beans
Teaspoon of coomin
Yikes.....ya didn’t drain your grease
Nice simple video,I  like the little music to.  I like to add a little garlic in my chili but I like the idea of the black beans I have to try that
THICC
You got all the fat liquid from cooking the hamburger you failed to drain off!
Love all the natural ingredients. Lazy mans way of cooking. Yuk!!!!!!!!!!!!
Where the chili powder
That stuff is not  _chili_ .  Chili only contains chili peppers, meat and spices.
1 pack McCormick Chilli Powder, 1 jar Pace Picante Sauce, 3 cans Bush Chilli Beans, 1/2 to pound of ground beef, chicken, turkey or pork. Brown meat add rest heat stir and eat.
Nothing ruins Chili like Kidney or Black beans,,,,Pinto Beans is the only way to go
You need to drain off the fat after you brown the meat.
I never add water to chili, always beer, beef broth or V8.
As far as gringo chili goes not bad I guess . Why use the word chili tho? This is just glorified spaghetti sauce.  Want real hot chili go to northern New Mexico .
Good chili but instesd of adding water i would add beef stock for more flavor.Just my 2cts.
Much like the beginning of a pasta meat sauce up until the addition of beans.
A little celery seed is a game changer
If you like it thick but don't want to chance burning it to bottom of pan, add 1-2 TB of psyillium husk.  It's a great thickener and adds some soluble fiber to your diet which is healthy.  I always add some while baking pies as well (I hate runny pie fillings when you go to slice a pie).  Yes, really,  psyillium husk, I'm not even kidding!  Works for making fruit jam as well, who needs pectin?
wow I just wasted almost 3 minutes for this
Nice but do it in a slow cooker that is what I would do!
You got a subscribe , simply because there was no waffle and lots of suggestions in the comments column over and above the silly comments
Where's the bed of elbow macaroni with the chili resting on top?
chillie beans and cornbread ! MMMMMMMMMMMM!
How long should I let it simmer?
yuk,  Hot Sauce.  Worst ingredient.  Use red pepper flakes.  Too much salt.  I don't care what brand hot sauce you use, it's awful.  If your looking to add heat in your recipe, use red pepper flakes.  It won't ruin your food.  Cut your salt in half.  Use a Bullion Cube.  It will give you some salt as well as flavor.   The rest is different but I could see it.  I will give you the Black Beans.  That could be interesting.  Might try that.
No thank you, Not with black beans
Oh a fresh made corn bread on the side with butter and sour cream and shredded cheddar for the chili
I add a bay leaf or two while the meat simmers and lots of chopped garlic would have been sautéed with meat and onions.  Lots of cumin, some paprika fresh parsley, oregano a bit of red wine red pepper flakes  a squeeze of fresh lemon and some ancho chili powder
Nice and simple and looks delicious. Will have to try the black beans. I try to not let my chili come to a boil, but let time and lower, [simmer], temperature, do all the work, so I give it a couple of hours. And I never cover it. But that's just a preference I've acquired over the years. Always remember the Tobasco! Thanks for sharing!
I love mine with homemade salsa .
I have seen in some chili videos that they add a slurry what that is cornstarch and water to thicken it up the reason why this guy didn't put any is because when he said when you put it in the refrigerator  that's the grease from the hamburger that thickens it up it still looks pretty good to me
Crock pot....
"World's Greatest"   Helpful tip: add your spices at the beginning as your onions sweat. The flavors will layer much better.
Not really Texas chili is the best
Why bother to put in a 1/3 onion either a whole or nothing
Corrections::  Do not add oil, drain fat off meat, rinse black beans, use one can of brooks chili beans (don’t rinse) and one can of black beans, get petite diced tomatoes or crushed tomatoes!  Chili O is best seasoning mix!!
How is this plain stuff even close to worlds best??
No beans. I use cayenne chilli powder garlic canned tomato sugar beef stock salt and pepper and melt cheese on top
Weak
I'm in Thailand and we eat this chili together with some steam rise.Taste good...aroi they say here.
Awesome job awesome video! Simple straight forward to the point!
Great Editing!!! Simple and to the point without all the fluff
Thank you
Suckass chilli
You didn't drain all that grease? Disgusting...
gET RID OF THE MUISIC AND SHOW THE INGREDIENTS RECIPE AT THE END. tHE LAST ADDITION  WAS SOMETHING OIL. bUT COULD NOT HEAR IT CLEARLY.
Looks good
It is soup
what no garlic or peppers, not enough onion
That looks gross. Not at all what I was expecting when I clicked the thumbnail.
Table spoon of salt :/
Please change spoon after you break up raw hamburger. Don't want to cross contaminate. You can get away with it a few times, but one day you will make everyone sick.
I make my chilli almost the same way as u do.  I love the black beans.  But sometimes I ad the black beans and red kidney beans.  I also ad paprika and garlic!  And I also ad a little chilli garlic sauce or sambal. .  I love that in it.
I'd throw the water down the drain and ad a quart can of Tomato juice.
Looks good,but where is the fresh chilli?
Weak recipe
No comment on the recipe itself, everyone has their own unique way... However;  please rinse out those cans and containers and add the rinse water to the other ingredients in the pot.  Too much waste ... Rinse and recycle!
Oh yeah don't forget your bell peppers green ones only and I also put to bay leaves in there don't ask me why just do it oh yeah you're welcome again
Okay man now I will take you to Chile School okay first Thing never put Tabasco sauce in your chili it has no flavor it's just heat all it does is make it hot to the mouth always used Louisiana hot sauce it has the flavor without the Heat it should be called a Louisiana flavor sauce okay the second thing to do is once you have your meat onions everything cooked before you had your beans take a can of refried beans mix it in with your broth / water once it's combined real good add your beans I use black beans light kidney beans dark kidney beans and pinto beans the key to the best chili is the refried beans it will thicken up the sauce you're very welcome don't tell anybody I told you this especially my daughter
I like to add a couple bell peppers and 2 poblano peppers and a jalapeno pepper or two to the chilli.  Then I use 3 different chilli powders to season the chilli. I do not saute the onion or peppers as they cook all day in my crock pot.  I do brown my meat be it chuck stew meat or chuck ground beef.
Looks like a great, easy recipe!  I'll probably try it with one can of beans, broth or stock instead of water, and some minced garlic.  Cheers!
the difference between good chili and great chili is if you can wait and eat it the next day! Cuz when you let it sit overnight it the seasons seem to richen! Enjoy!
Ive been craving chili for sooo long... but never made it myself. Thank you!! All the ingredients u mentioned were already home.. so thankful. Awesome directions
I use cream cheese. So can use more chili.
Scrumptious.!!!!!!!!!!
shouldnt you drain the bean juices from the can ?
World's easiest chili: You open up a couple cans of Hormel Chili. Heat it up until it's bubbling. Then open a bag of pre-grated cheddar cheese. And dice up some onion... no, that's too hard. And wallah, easy chili.
I was watching end of the world videos and some how I ended up here. 🤔
what's the fat/lean ratio of the meat? What kind of tomatoes? Don't you rinse the beans? I'm out.
That onion looked like it was cut up by a blind guy, no consistancy in the size of pieces
Should have started off with bacon grease not oil. Adding water? C’mon. Fresh vegetables have water in them. This is a walmart special chili at best.
I fed this to my Granny and she died after - You haven't heard the last of this!
Is chilli so wet? lol
This recipe flat-out works. I'll also add chopped garlic, but not until it's about a half-hour before it's ready to serve. I can also substitute crushed red pepper for the Tabasco. I don't like it that much if I use them both at the same time, so I randomly choose just one or the other each time I make it. When I use crushed red pepper, I add it to the simmering onions at the beginning. I add butter & brown sugar, too. I also like trying out different kinds of canned beans, too. It never turns out the same from one time to the next, but it's always good.
At first it looked really watery. But then by the end it looked awesome, nice and thick. Well done.
How long did you simmer it for ,I like the recipe.
😖
Loved it...Simple and looks so yummy!!! THANK YOU!!!
Nice quick and simple recipe, but not very professional I must say. For one..........Nothing was measured. And adding WATER ?.........its better to add any kind of Broth instead. Also, most Chilli's contain a decent amount of either Sugar or Molasses.
Texas style chili. Cook a mix of hamburger and venison. That gives you a better texture as the hamburger doesn't hold up well to six or more hours of cooking. Add onions, diced or shredded finely, garlic, half a bell pepper. Cook down then add salt, cumin, chili powder. Bloom the chili powder. Add chicken stock and tomato sauce, less acidic than tomatoes. Add red kidney beans. Simmer all day adding water as needed. Before serving mix a couple of tablespoons of corn starch in some water and stir into the chili to thicken it up.
Well first you don’t use hamburger meat for chili. Use course ground chili meat. And when you add beans it’s no longer chili. Might as well call it a casserole! Must be from NY
Looks simple enough
Yum! I want this for dinner
Muy Riko  Gracias
Always drain off the fat after you brown the meat. That's what causes  people to have acid reflux and heartburn. But, if you like going to a doctor and spending money on Prilosec, be my guest.
Iso lenbra o peca pal
Exactly my recipe, minus the cumin. I user habanero instead of cayenne.
you didn't even drain the juice from the beans
Great recipe. Very simple, and similar to how I make mine, which turns out perfect every time!
Dude..the best chili recipe i've tasted...great..all my family love it...great thumbs up...and by the way the black beans gives it a excellent taste.
I thought everyone put beans in their chili, honestly.
Try it with tomato juice instead of water.
I added liquid smoke to my ground beef half way through cooking it. I don't know how it will taste it's a test. I'm still cooking it.
Guys, a tip, because tomato is an acidic -component, to get the balance correct yu hv to add  at least a spoonful + some sugar, to make the flavour more well rounded. When cooking a dish its like  chemistry, you have to get the flavours correct for the taste buds on your tongue , so your tasting different note in the food, not just something  thats  beige,  with one note, but a symphony of .flavours, thats the difference between a good cook & a bad one
Never thought of using water. I always use tomato sauce along with diced or crushed tomatoes. I like black beans too, along with some pinto or kidney beans. I use garlic powder also. I have seen recipes that use oregano as well. Sometimes i use a crock pot, but i have gotten to where i usually prefer the stovetop. It's also faster. Good video
Bell pepper, jalapeños, garlic
Yuk
For me it needs a lot more tomato product. Plus far more cumin and chili powder, and no garlic even? And where are the chilis lol it is chili after all.
Poor excuse for chili if you have use beans, & canned at that
Claims “greatest” in title LMAO you don’t get out much? I make the greatest hot pocket quote me
This  is chili beans recipe
Great looking pot of stew.  There are no beans in chili.  Thanks.  Great video.
Looks good, I`ll try this recipe ! Since it takes a fair amount of time to make chili, I always make a BIG potful, then package it in those plastic containers from a Chinese restaurant, and freeze it. That way, I always have some available in a hurry. Bon Appetit` !
Is that an aluminum pot?
"COOMAN"
Worlds greatest Chili..with no Chili in it..😁👍
I did It! It came out pretty good too. Thanks for the recipe. It takes a little patience on the stovetop to make it chili as opposed to hamburger soup but it came out just fine. Thanks, again.
Too many beans
Far to many beans, That’s all you’d taste. To watery looked like piss. 🤮🤮🤮🤢🤢🤢
I think your recipe is near perfect except that I think it needs an 8oz can on tomato sauce and a teaspoon or two of brown sugar. Also, I prefer red or pinto beans rather than black beans although it really doesn't matter. Bush's Chili beans are really nice in a chili.
Oh my gawd! I love this SUPER basic recipe! I serve it whenever I have my easy to please friends over for dinner. Thank you God bless
Corn carrots celery and I would put white Beans. That would do it justice
Is fresh tomatoes okay?
Chili is meat, spices and sauce only.  This is NOT chili.  It is chili and beans.  True chili does not have beans.  Award winning?  doubt it.
What about the grease duh
Seriously you call that crap chilli. What the hell are you doing putting water in your so called chilli. That looked like shit. I guess that you like eating grease because you did not drain it after cooking the ground beef.
Did anyone else ever wonder why people are all the time saying "I'm going to GO AHEAD " and do something ? Go ahead of what ???
I don’t use water in mine just beef broth
I'm subbing he just made life less complicated
Lost me at beans.
nothing remotely special about this recipe.
Do not forget to put your Toilet Rolls in the freezer the night before,as it will give a nice cooling effect after this goes through you,and will ease the burning feeling all around your little delicate area. lol
To all the self proclaimed chili snobs here. You're complaining about the beans in chili?  If y'all knew beans about true Texas chili not only does it not have beans in it, it also has no tomatoes, and does not use ground beef!  True Texas Red is little more than cubed beef browned in lard then cooked in a "gravy" of various dried chilies, toasted in a skillet, seeds and stems removed, soaked in hot water then blended or mashed with cumin, salt and pepper cooked with diced onions and garlic, thickened with masa harina.  What he has posted here is a good general recipe for what America has come to call chili!
Beans, tomatoes, hamburger??? This might me a tasty stew, but it ain’t chili.
You didn't drain the grease off the meat and you never ever add canned beans untill last just to  bring back to a boil for they are already cooked and over cooking them makes the shells come off.
Lost me at onions.
No cock sucking onions!!!!!
You never, never, EVER put beans in chili. I have spoken.
This is only the third best chilli recipe in the world. To make the best you need a piece of cinnamon, chopped smoked streaky bacon in at the start, then a sprinkling of cocoa powder mixed in right at the end.
I like to use ground round and I drain the fat juices out. I've never tried black beans. Your black beans were spiced?
No garlic???
I'm not sure about that recipe. You forgot to drain off the meat.
Making chili is like making a stew. There is no such thing as a right o9r wrong way.
I drain the grease from the fried meat . I also drain and rinse the beans and I usually use 2 cans of kidney beans , 2 cans of stewed tomatoes , 1 whole onion , several cloves of garlic. Next comes the chipolata chili powder , salt , black pepper and let it simmer all day. Just before we eat I add about 1/3 of a pack of cooked elbow macaroni. Left overs can be baked the next day with a layer of cheese over them. Or just tossed in a bowel and microwaved.
maybe a little tomato paste
That`ll work!!!! Nice
Looks so good, I'll be right over
you didnt drain the fat. off....GROSS
I hope everyone who makes this DRAINS the fat and the beans , my God dude
Looks Great !! And under 3 min !!! Perfect video. I will make this.. with a few mods. Celery, less cumin, bacon ( fn right Bacon: ) and simmer with 2 ( whole ) jalapenos added. In the quest for My perfect chili. Again.. thanks for the great ideas !!!
Looks like dog shit
I would add some garlic and tomato paste
Bush's chili beans are better.
Impossible for this to be the world's greatest chili recipe because I make the world's greatest chili.
You really should rinse the beans there packed in a brine .
Greatest is subjective, maybe simplest is a better description.
I'll give this a try but I will leave the beans out.
Where I'm from we hang people that put beans in chili!
Awesome and it would be super healthy with ground turkey and maybe add some tumeric.
Garlic,tomato puree,sugar.
No beans please !
My chili looks and probably taste better.  I would be willing to put it to a challenge. Next day that is. It takes 3 days to make.
Lovely. Thank you. I don't eat meat so I'll do a ground beef substitute
that is the nastiest chili I have ever seen..black beans? really>?
You lost me completely by not draining off the fat....then adding beans.
I  make it almost the same, only I add beef stock instead of water and also some garbanzo beans for more crunch
A real chili as no beans in it
Never used black beans, i think i will try
how long do you let it all boil together till finished
I was actually going to just blow past this as I am a chef and have my own recipe, but I figured what the heck, I'll give it a watch, see just what is being labeled as the Worlds Greatest Chili.  Well, I don't even have to make this to know that It's good!  It is my recipe exactly! Well, almost!  After the ground meat is cooked,  I put some chopped garlic to it.  I use petite diced tomatoes and will put anywhere from a half a small can of tomato paste to a full one. Helps to thicken it and kind of boosts the tomato richness.  I will also use just a touch of either beef base or pork base depending upon which ground meat I use.  I think this comes from my professional use of it and many home cooks are unaware of the boost that bases will give a dish.  I keep just as many bases in my refrigerator at home as what I have in a commercial kitchen! Anyway, this is my basic chili recipe!  Depending upon my mood, I am known to add a small can of diced green chilies, sometimes corn (frozen white shoepeg of course) and sometimes I am in the mood to put barley in it! Sometimes, just one of these additions, sometimes a couple, sometimes, ALL of them!  Want a little corn richness to it? Thicken it up with some corn masa, the powdered stuff (once you have it in your kitchen, you will be amazed at how often you may use it). Anyway, as I said, I don't have to make this to know It's good! (There's a batch in the fridge right now as a matter of fact!)  And he's right about the black beans!  Much, MUCH better choice of bean!
Not bad! I use beef broth and hot Rotel. I add hatch chili powder cyan powder as need. Then there are various chilis from my garden! Spicy hot is a real man's game!
I am actually going to cook some chili tomorrow.  So glad this popped up!!!
This is the way I make chili, I don't add all that water and I don't rinse the beans.
I substitute sweet potatoes for meat add corn celery black olives green peppers sour cream on top blue corn chips looks good
Try adding about a half a cup of strong black coffee, and a tablespoon of  molasses....
Mine is easier and better.
Thanks. I  will  make this tomorrow
This is pretty much how I make my chili but I also add allspice and cinnamon to taste
Looks delicious,thanks.
I'll try it like the black beans thanks
I use v8 or tomato juice instead of water, also chop up some celery and a few chili peppers with the onion
Can you put it in the fridge and microwave it later
FORGOT PEPPERS  oops!  Add more cayenne, then take the heat off with honey. YUM! You will not be sorry.
Thicc and delish. ;)
Looks good
Made up a batch !    Good !
For the people thats criticizing the guys chili, get a life. People can make chili however they want too. Make your own damn chili they you want.
