Not related to art, but I love your lipstick girl! What brand and shade is it? Absolutely love it!
Your's has been the Best Idea I've seen so far. Especially because it's not copy catting the others vessels. It's refreshing to have a more unique way. I 💜 them, I'm more into unique whimsical ideas like your's and other's who used polish bottles, soda cans and bottles. Eyeliner, lip stick, Ect. TY I already have everything I'm going to enjoy these in my pen collection and my boy's won't sneak off and leave me their empty pens, 😆. Keep up the awesome unique ideas 💡.
Please hindi me bolo
Just wondering if sealing the ink stop it from working? I has on me. I was making resin pens for teacher appreciation week. Thx for any helpful reply.

Great DIY. Quick question though, why didn't you use the oil that you use in the last one with the orbeez for the glitter pen? Will it do something to the glitter?
How would you cover it ?

Superb does ink get mixed with water
from where did u get bottles
cooolllll
amazing
you should make a slime pen
To make it not dried out
Where is the cap on the pen
nossa que legal continue colocando novidades
love you too
How I made it (I know this was uploaded years ago but who cares): 1. Take a pen  2. Open the pen and put the ink stick sorta thing somewhere 3. Take water 4. Take glitter or whatever you want.  5. IF YOUR TAKING GEL THeN DO NOT USE water. 6. Put water in pen, put glitter/ whatever in and close it 7. If you have holes at the end of your pen then use glue and leg it harden 8. After it's hard, it's a solid now and can prevent water falling on your pages when your writing    Thanks!
Your the best!!👍🏻🍿🍭
You should make squishys✌🏼✌🏼✌🏼
I actually love this method!!  But did anyone think what happen when the ink of the pen will finish?😂😂😂

But how do you keep the pen from drying out
can you use modeling clay??
I love your diys there amazing!😊
интерессно ещё руские здесь есть???
GUYS SOME THINGS KARINA SAID TO DO DIDN'T WORK && HAD TO BE IMPROVISED:   Baby Oil && Food Colouring mixed with water didn't work && the water just stayed @ the bottom. I used all the different ratios I could && nothing worked.   -The beads don't exactly float. depends on what kind && they need to be rounded.  If they're not rounded, the they'll pack together which is still cool, but if you want that "orbeez" effect, then they have to be rounded.   The Cork Didn't really become "squishy" as she claimed, && it was extremely hard. Maybe it's the cork or needle I used,  but be careful.   When the model magic clay dries, apply a layer of mod podge over it to protect it from crumbling or "melting" bc if it touches any liquid, it'll leave cracks && creases.   Don't get me wrong I love these DIYs but if any of you attempt it, here are some things that didn't work out (for me) For more info, or questions, DM @kats.apparel on Instagram :))
yeah ut how do you close the pen so the ink doesnt dry out
copiona
I didn't understand what did she put on the top of the pen. Sorry for my english

I like the beads and where did u get the glass tubes
so I finally tried it!! I love how to came out but to get the ink thing in the cork was really hard! idk like I was wetting it a lot and idk but I had a hard time doing that. Also I needed more glue for the lava because mine it just changed the color it didn't come out exactly like bubbles I guess their called. Anyways I still liked how it ended up👍

my favorite Arts N Crafts DIY Is the beads. the neon color is 😍
Don't try this. I did and was very upset. It turns out that if you seal the end of the pen it doesn't let air in so it only writes a little bit.

Hey your pretty good at these things. 😉👌🏻

This is cute and something my girl scouts would love to try. I think you should rename them to Baby Bottle Pens. They look exactly like the baby bottles that used to come with a light up bear my 24 year old daughter had when she was little.  Anyway, just a thought. I'm old enough to be your Momma so listen to your elders, lol peace ☮
this is so freakin coool!!!!

I love this! however, I'd be afraid of it breaking or losing it in bag, so if I was to make it, I wouldn't include the actual ink but make it like a paperweight or a cute glow decoration by putting a light source on the bottom

ya he hecho 3, pero lo pruebo para ver como escribe el bolígrafo (siendo una tinta recién comprada) y no pinta. No se porque me sucede esto. Pongo pegamento para que no entre el baby oil y la punta de bolígrafo esta bien, pero aun así deja de pintar, no lo entiendo ¿que hago para que pinte el bolígrafo?

Hello I have polymer clay can I use that and then back it like the instructions say ?  like 125 degrees for like 20 minutes ? do you think it would mess up the actual pen or the contents inside the best bottle?

I just read "liquid penis" in the title...
Wouldn't the pen just run out?
that is so amazing
I hate you ! boo ❌
cover for the pen?😂
Zxc
That looks awesome  but I don't have the ingredients and materials 😂
I love those pens
Qui est francais ?
I like this and I try to do this..
you cope this from rclbeauty101!!
That shouldn't work because the way the pen works because the pen writes with the ink throug sucking the air out the bottom, sticking glue on the top is going to prevent that
you pretty much have to diy everything if you want something cool looking...they don't sell anything like this is stores! awesome pens!
tu ni a los talones le llegas a maphie
Won't the pens dry out without a cap tho
LOVE how unique your ideas are!! :)

I really like your ideas it's just I wish someone would help you edit your videos because they're repeating of your words is driving me nuts I want to turn the volume down but I have to listen so I know what to do and I thought maybe it was just a couple of videos but now it's every video you do you're doing a great job I'm not trying to hate or being negative I just think you need to show someone your video to help you edit to make sure you're not so repetitive keep up the great work

I'm not sure how you even have so many followers. Twice now you have collaborated with people and your video isn't up when there's are. I understand people get busy and have others things to do but you should at least have respect for the collab and have your stuff ready when everyone else's is. I'm so disappointed and haven't subscribed for this exact reason
where do you get the glass containers?
I like the lava pen

Cool idea. The only thing is those "orbeez" weren't real orbeez
I like your videos but I hate how you're always trying to like clear something up before you start... who cares if someone else made a video first? who cares if you're lighting isn't perfect? who cares if your makeup isn't on point? do you girl
What are the glass container called? Where can you buy it

Any sustitute for that bottle

How are they not drying
But, won't it dry out? I mean, it doesn't have a cap.

helpful hint: use play dough for the cap thing instead of clay  it dries easier and you can make rainbow caps and stuff like that
so cool I wish I had your brain ft love kittens 🐈🐱🐱😇
My favorite ones are the gilleter one and the lava lamp one
Aren't they garbage after the ink runs out?...
Density of he beads causes them to float I believe

Not into falling for those crocodile tears So you've got NOWHERE TO FLEE Now your soul belongs to me  You've been invited to my spider dance spider dance, spider dance, spider dance So move along with me and clap your hands, clap your hands, clap your hands I'm gonna trap you in my spider dance, spider dance, spider dance You know a heart like yours cant stand a chance In this dizzying,twisted dark romance  Paralized, fear is in your eyes But your crys will go unheard even if you try Stuggling is futile so get tangled up in me Cause to suvive i think you're gonna have to pay a little fee  Get caught in my spider dance, spider dance, spider dance You know a heart like yours can't stand a chance Got your marionette strings in my hands  Some might call it greed But I think it's a need I could let you be But it wont come for free  Caught you in my spider dance, spider dance, spider dance I knew your heart could never stand a chance Got your marionette strings in my hands ===================================================================================================== i like spider dance a wrote al the lyrics out and put them here 4 no reason this took 10-15 min

AHH! CONGRATS ON 2 MILLION SUBS! OMFG YOUR CHANNEL IS GROWING SO QUICKLY! 😀♥️🎉
and most of them are just so funny
so cool! and people stop judging her, if she's saying she didn't copy, so she DIDN'T COPY...! anyway this idea is way different I love it :D
I would have tried this but sadly I used my glass bottles when I was younger...
I can't be the only one who read the title as Penis instead of pens
Can you do a room tour?
how will you close it
Who else looks at her mouth the whole time she talks in the intro? 😂
Wait what happens if you drop it when your at school and it splatters everywhere? How hard is it to clean up? Since it is glass and u drop it it breaks. Just asking.
Congrats on 2 million subscribers! ❤
I thought it said penis and not pens😂
Where do you get the containers for the pens plz answer and tell me I really want to know where to get the containers !!!!!!!❤️☺️🤗

I just think it's ironic that this is the second time that this situation with Maphie has happened. But there's always such thing as coincidence.
OMG I read it has penis orbeez my mind 😅
WE HAVE THE SAME LAST NAME ! WE COULD BE LONG LOST COUSINS OMLLLLL SLAY MY LIFE KARINA SLAYYYYYYY

Omg I love you soooooo much
DIY edible glue
2 million!!
YOURE ACTUALLY GETTING TO THE POINT YAYYY!!!
I thought this said 'diy liquid penis'
You're being really sketchy about this whole copying maphie thing.
helllo
0:26 aw karina sounds like she's gonna cry!😭😭
I WANTED YOU TO COME TO CANADA
there awesome wish I had one 😄
why do u talk soooooooo fast
ilysm! your beautiful and so is your attitude! i really think your so sweet and creative
STITCHES
I 💜 you and your videos sooooooooooooooo much😘😘😘😘😘😘😘
it should have a lid
How do Youtubers always make everything so perfect??
actually the pen will stop working after a few minutes cause she sealed off the end so there will be a vacuum generated. Pens work only because of air pressure. But still it looks pretty to keep in a pen stand.
any youtubers what to support each other subscribe and immediately comment when and I'll subscribe back :)
I love your make-up 😍❤
will you make the cap for it?
are you tchiding you are not the same peson with the hello maphei  ?  I think you are the same
probably one of the coolest things youve mad
lovely <3
Congratulations Karina on 2 million!  :-)
Made the glitter one and I love it😍
Hello Maphie is known for stealing people's ideas so idk why people think Karina stole her idea. She had it on her snapchat first and I'm 99.9999% sure Hello Maphie seen it and jumped on the idea and made a video and uploaded it before this came up.
bruh don't worry about ur haters
2m!!!
I love your channel
2.000.000 SUBS! CONGRATS!❤️

what about the lid for the pen
Well done for 2 million. Subs xx 👍🏻

I love you girl you are one of my favorite YouTuber. And I tried it and it worcked and my friends said it was the coolest thing they have ever seen and I told them go check out kirina Grace. Sorry if I spelled your name wrong. 😘😘

Thats moment when u read ''DIY Liquid Penis'' ;-;
Those will stop working very quickly as you sealed the ink in and it won't be able to go down the tube and make the pen work. It's unfortunate I know
OMG! 2 Million Subs! Been here since 500,000!
omg you are amazinggg❤
WooooW! 😍 You're so talented.
How can you refil the ink if it runs out?
YOU ARE SO SWEET!
Congrats on 2m!💞 You deserve it!!
I would just measure the ink pen to the bottle so the ink isn't so small 😉
lol
I like tge green one!

Can you make liquid phone cases :)
she gets subscribers  so freaking fast last month or 2 months ago she just hit 1million now she just hit 2million wtf girl teach me your ways!
Why does she always have same vids as maphie?!
You did something  different  from hellomaphei
warning in advance for anybody who wants to do this - i've heard lots of folks who make small charms with those glass bottles say that clear glue and other liquids can either discolor over time or evaporate through the stopper completely. to keep the latter from happening, you can apply a coat or two of nail varnish to the bottom of your cork, creating a seal!  since it's a pen tho it would probably get used up before that happens anyway, haha  additionally, putting glue on the end of the ink cartridge may prevent ink from flowing and ultimately give your pen a rather short life span, since no air can displace the ink that's being used. don't quote me on this tho but when it comes down to it, this is a fun craft with a pretty outcome and that's what matters! have fun using your pens, friends! <3
Am I the only one who can't understand her? Maybe because I'm Italian, but I see tons of videos in English and she talks too fast. I can understand something, but this bothers me...
2 MILLION
Wow it so cool and amazing I want to do expiriments with you

I love them both but Karina's method is better than Hello Maphie's method, imo. The only question I have is how would you keep the pen from drying out when not in use? Other than that, great video Karina! The pens are uber cute and the model magic clay at the end makes it look complete 😊
Awwww! I had some pens like these when I was a kid
You should do a light up pen

I read the title wrong... Don't judge me.
For the beads one just put a couple orbeez beads in and water (no glue) and let them grow inside the pen! It'll look really squishy and cool
This is so creative. I love your videos!!

I havent done any of your DIY's but I  have tried some of your life hacks. The one when you hold your key in between your fingers to stay safe. No reason, I just wanted to test it out. It makes you feel like some kind off vampire or something XD

AMAZING VIDEO K!!
These are really cool, I want to make one now!!!
You can tell she's ugly as fuck without makeup.
Do people really get pressed about you trying other things that aren't original.  Tf yall need to chill. Most things are hard to be original at its ok to do their DIY's that people have done.
you make cool looking pens
great video I'm so trying this
2million subd
For the lava one can you use oil
Yesss she finally hit 2 million!!😭❤️ she deserves that and more !!!
Love it
Must so do! 😍😍😍
Omg. This time I actually have everything I need to make the glitter one and lava lamp one. ☺️☺️
Congrats on 2million

Who's a little early but doesn't have anything to say
actually she didn't do this check hellomapie did this
This was legit the cutest DIY I've seen all year I just gotta do this
THATS WHAT SHE SAIDDDDDD OMFG  when she was explaining how to poke the needle thru the cork 😂😂😂
parece aquelas mamadeira que a gente brincava de dar leite pra boneca quando era criança. Se tiver algum br por aqui, talvez lembre hahahah
When I read  pens I thought the title was edible penis
+Alexandra Gonzalez how do u even know?  You shouldn't acuse people like that

Omg ur almost to 2,000,000 subs congrats
So cool
Where did u get those jars❓
Woah! That's cool!
Happy 2 million😊😊
lowkey hate Jacobs videos.  he copies so much shit....
I READ IT AS LIQUID PENIS UNTIL THE END OF THE VIDEO
Karina is almost at 2 million!!!
I have to say this is absolutely my favorite DIY channel. I've come across so many others and I just love this Channel!!!! So many creative cute and cool ideas. I love them!!!
Ok, your really good at DIYS, HOWEVER you talk so fast it gets really aggravating sometimes. Really not trying to be mean or anything, just letting you know
my favourite was the glitter one
can anyone tell me where to get those glass jar things
OMGOSH! I LOVE THIS VIDEO! I WANNA MAKE THESE NOW!
You are so close to 2m!
Almost 2000000 million
Hey Karina, do the containers have to be a certain size?
OMG!!! almost 2M!!!!!
you always make super cool thang this vido need more 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
amen cool
The lava one looks extremely cool I'm going to make it ☺️ literally the first diy I'm ever making tbh
coo
honestly Karina I thought lucas's thumbnail was a ball sack.... ...
will it dry out
Where my nonifacation squad at
You talk so fast slow down
Where are the caps for the pens??   Am i the only one who cares XD
OMG THIS IS YOUR BEST ONE YET
I thought it said penis pens omggggg
cute
this is so cute!!! oh btw ur beautiful
THIS IS COMPLETELY UNRELATED TO THE VIDEO BUT WHO LOVES MELANIE MARTINEZ?!
water and these types of jars is a BAD IDEA.  the cork absorbs the water over time and becomes moldy.  if you do this, coat the cork with clear nail polish first.
Does anyone else have a dirty mind lol?
This is the second time you basically copied her..
what lipstick are you wearing LOVE IT
Great job!
tbh that's really cool
How about if hellomaphie is trying to copy karina ???
UR SO CLOSE TO 2,000,000
those are beads not orbeez
Omg this gave me an idea for party favors for my sister's babyshower. They're so cute i could make them look like baby bottles 👌ty Karina for your creativity
I feel like she always does the same videos as maphie… and it's a "total coincidence" every time?
You could use these without the pen part as a play bottle for baby dolls for kids
that
This is so cute! I'm definitely going to make these when I get the material.
so cool I'm going to try tat
where did you find the glass containers
2:09 slide in tightly so nothing else can go in. 😂😲 omfg
Yayyyyyy almost 2 million

OMG I thought hat was a real cap how did she et it so perfect
the booty looks like a ball sack lmfao
This is bomb!
I hope you get 2 million soon 😊
that was so cool
Omg so close to 2000000
She makes it look so easy
This is super cool😱

I loved your diy!!😀😀 I was just wondering, though, how would you make the actual cap for the pen, so it doesn't dry out? I would like to know since I want to make it myself, but I don't want the pen to dry out.
turn on the captions.
Where do you get the containers at
cool
They look like baby bottles idk
could it work wit a pencil
Ur so creative

YOUR SO CLOSE TO 2 MILLION!! I REMEMBER WHEN YOU HAD 200K!!! AND IM STILL HERE
Where can I get the little bottles for a low price, like you have in the video.
Karina, you've got the most creative ideas. Your brain works like a supercomputer. Why don't you make some edible DIYS, it would be pretty cool.
it's cause the corn syrup is a lot more dense than water
Was I the only one who watched the pen kinda roll away at 2:05 😂😁
Lol these are so adorable! I need to make some
Were can you get top container to,cover the pen and were do you get the bottle

Video Starts At 1:17
why do youtubes ask veiwers to comment with any reason, its just kinda dumb. I prefere for youtubers to sa have a great day or something like that, so it doesn't push to like and subcribe
i hate when i'm outside and u upload a video and i can't watch it at the moment and i hate everything and everyone and i can't wait to get home so i can watch it and relax and actually watch it like 429943 times..like untill u upload ur new video... THAT'S HOW AMAZING U ARE OKAY? OKAY. 💜

This method is great, because it shows people different options for what to put inside, and that we can use any clear containers. Really thick pens are easier on my hands, so I bet I would really like to write with these. Thanks for the video :D

Try Elmer's glue when making liquid glass                   - Ms.experiment
How do you keep the pens from drying out when you aren't using it?

Glad this DIY worked out in the end. It looks AMAZING!

That Clay that you smoothed out and hard and for the tip of pen, looks a legitimately like a plastic one.. Good job. 😀
why do people care so much about if you copied? You didn't. and what does it matter if you did?
You should do a DIY rice/corn heat pack

Thats so cool i wanna try it
okay literally once karina comments on someone's comment, everyone just talks on the comment trying to get her to notice them. I just saw someone write 'I like pens' on her comment like???
When I saw the pictureC I thought the one with the beads was going to be a pen version of the game where you try to get the rings on the little peg in the middle of the box.
she is gonna hit 2 million subscribers 💟💘✋
Okay, so I made one, except I fill it with hot cocoa every morning and the jar thingy is painted. there is a straw at the end and I drink hot cocoa out of it during class. :) BTW it works as a pen.
Your pretty without make up
You shod make a house tour video
Hey girl hey
I watch DIYS and never do them but I actually want to do this one
+Karina Garcia will they dry out
Another cool one you can do is put actual orbeez in it so they grow and it looks like multicolored blobs
OMG CHILLAX, omg I DIDNT COPY OMG HONESTLYY OMG DONT JUDGE ME; OMG I MADE IT MYSELF; OMG OMG ; LIKE RALLY.. jesus....

Hi karina
You sure? I swear you purposely copied HelloMaphie. It's a weird coincidence especially you upload around some days after Maphie did.
I love ya so much and awesome
The pens look so cool!!! Wish I could make one!!!! You didn't copy! Great minds think alike!❤️❤️❤️❤️
I love it
I LOVE THESE SO MUCH! SUBSCRIBED!! UGH SO DOING THESE💜💜
I thought it said penis at first
thank you  text me
What an original idea! (Not!!!)
Awesome! Maybe just change the title of the video from Orbeez to Beads because it's a bit misleading
I love these pens!! They are really cute!!
I thought I wad be the first person😂

Totally trying out this diy!😍❤😘
SHE NO COPYCAT YASSS GIRL U AWESOME
2mil!!!!!
The reason the beads float in the corn syrup is because of the density. Corn syrup  is very dense compared to the beads
Great minds think alike
I thought it said liquid penis... Oops
Lol If you still think I copied anyone after the disclaimer than you are just out of your mind. As soon as I saw her video I texted her showing her a pic lol. And the video had been up for only an hour. Y'all think I went through all these methods and FINALLY got the right one, filmed, etc all in 1 hour? 😂 y'all wild
I love u karina and I know u came up with the idea by your self
who cares if "hellomaphie" did it first. same idea, different presentation. happens all the time golly
Where do you get the cork bottles?
You are one of my favorite YouTubers. Your DIY'S are Amazing! This one is one of your best ones! ily!!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
