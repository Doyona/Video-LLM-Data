What was the discount code for this??
You should do more videos.  You are fun to watch
Thx awesome as usual u r so cute too ❤🎉
I wasn't watching YouTube 6 years ago so I never even knew bubble bars were a thing.
did you use liquid glycerin or solid?
Watched a couple times did not hear coupon ?
I wonder what caused her ance to flare up so bad here. It's usaually not this bad.
0:05 What the... Wath is with youre face!? Like that's the first thing that i saw in the intro
I want to eat those so bad
Awww a bayybeeee
Genius to use a stand mixer 👍
Katie, you are so awesome. We learn so much from you! Apparently, now the term "bubble bar" has been trademarked so the rest of us have to call them something else. Thanks for being royally awesome!
I would love to see this in a lemon lime situation
Glad this video popped up!
Love your energy, you are awesome! Thanks for sharing this with us!💚
I'm 5 years in the future and she looks so different with long hair
You're accent is adorable 🤩
Holy balls. Watching in 2021 and she is so young!! Love that her level of energy has not waned.
I can’t wait to watch all your vids! You have a similar personality to me so your teaching method appeals. Have a great day. Are you in the military? I just wondered due to the royal reference ans what you are wearing =) xxx
You really do teach very well. Really well laid out. Well described. You make it so easy to follow and copy. Thank you =)
I was confused about the sound quality but then i realized its 5 years old not 5 months.... thanks algorithm
You sound like the Amanda show!
I enjoyed watching this.  It was so fun!, I enjoy your smile.
You sound SO YOUNG in this video! It's amazing how you built your business from such a young age. It's really fun to watch these old videos and see how your skills have grown. <3
Katieeeeee your voice has changes do much :-O you were a wee baby here!
What on your Face?
Wow, you're so professional, at like, 17/18, years old, lol 🦋
I’ve had really bad Psriosis so I know the feeling ... the reason I watch her is natural bar soap really helped me
Rolls bubble bar * My brain: eat it Me: what My brain: ITS TAFFY
Добрый день. А можно рецепт.🤗
I hate Mika
What is the elternative for cream tarter
Anyone watching in 2020?
Wow you looked like a child 5 years ago I love it 😄
I feel like saying something meaningful.
The bubble soap looks like wasabi
Oh gosh shes so young in this video!
shes so pretty >:00
If you cut out meat and dairy your acne would go away.
The Great 2020 Rewatch!
But was the actual coupon code ever shared??
Os olhos dessa menina são a coisa mais linda do mundo. Além de ser incrivelmente simpática. Uma fofa 😍❤️
Little Katie 🥺
P.O.V: your scrolling through the comments trying to find the hate comments everyone keeps talking about. On another note, love your videos!
These bubble bars are beautiful! The texture looks like its to die for
So on the subject of stand mixers... KitchenAid is very nice, but not in my budget right yet. I've found several other brands in a better price range, but not sure which size to buy. Any one have any suggestions?
I just think poeple should stop commenting on her acne evan if its nice comments because it can still make poeple feel bad.
It’s funny how different she’s talking/acting, but that makes sense since it was 4 years ago
I dont even make soap or have ever been Interested in making soap yet I've watched almost alll of your videos because of your craft but mainly for your funny personality! I've fallen in loveeeee with u! Also anyone else think these bars look like cookies and just wanaa bite em!?! Or am I just fat lolol
Im obsessed with Katie! Also, that yellow kitchenaid is life!~
What is the ingredients please !
i’m not just saying this. she is still so pretty without makeup.
Your personality is so fun and quirky. And I love your eyes they are so beautiful!!! 😍😍😍😍
That is neat.  If you make it again, can you try a braid, or twist, with different colours?
Is the bubble bar recipe SLS SLSA free.
It's fun to see your older stuff (I only found you like, a week ago) Seeing how you have grown and your confidence these days is so cool to compare
do you still make these? any chance youll re film this with your leveled up filming skills?
Katie looks so young and beautiful in this video! She is honestly one of the most beautiful ladies I've seen, I love her confidence and attitude
Omg how old were you here? 💖💖
Nevada pin on your collar!!!! Are you a Nevadan?? 😍😍😍
:0 a wild baby Katie appears!!!
watching 5 years later: Her acne gets so much better!
Im so used to not seeing her wear makeup this was so... Normal
OMG it's baby Katie!
You are so serious in these earlier videos, loved watching this Katie x
Wait - you can’t copywrite recipes.
I wish I was this confident
After watching this video I bought the recipe, I never made it. 4 years later I finally got around and bought the ingredients to make it :)
I absolutely love you! You are hilarious and remind me of my sister ❤ you are adorable
That soap... looks really tasty. I want a bite.
Just reminding everyone that this is a soap video, not a video about appearances. Thanks.
To speed up the commercial ads, click on the circled “i” on the bottom left and click “stop seeing ad” then click any option. Then push cancel. You’re welcome😘
wow this is way back i believe that i have spam watched your videos
Who in there right mind would sell a recipe for 20$ what the heck I just want to make the soap and have fun but I am not paying 20$ holy crap bro
uhh why are all the comments like 4 years ago . Felix started streaming 20 hours ago O-O
its interesting seeing how far she's come c: the soap reminds me of mochi icecream and im cravin it now lol
Love it!!!
aww omg looking back on old royalty soap videos just reminds me how cute katie is!! your passion, knowledge, and heart are keeping me going during quarantine. sending love from chicago <3
i want to try it :O !
Is there still a coupon code for the recipe? I didn’t hear her say it in the video
oh boy your skin...
WOOT!
Do you mind me asking where you got your sealing machine????  I just want a small simple one like yours, not a whole production one LOL
At least Katy is not fake, I’m not here to see her acne ( I suffer from acne too) love all he soap 🧼 videos 🤗
Your skin is bad.
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Y’all this was 5 years ago 😳 wow that’s dedication
I’m totally going to start making soap, I love all of your videos! Thanks so much for all of the wonderful information🙃
Thanks for sharing!❤❤
I take it u are not a fan of Lush.
Welcome to 2020 where no one give a fuck about acne anymore.. I'm just proud to see her very much alive and so.... Enthusiastic (non native speaker here) and about to comment about her energy.. And saw few comments about people defending her from people who probably saying sth about her acne.. Lol I don't hv time to scroll down just to read mean comments..be proud of who you are and keep on inspiring people. With or without acne you are you and please know that you probably made hundreds of people starting their own small soap business for their side or main income❤️
Can this be moulded in a mooncake press rather than rolled?
I love you so much!! You make me smile on my worst days❤
Katie your confidence and love for what you do is refreshing  Love your videos
I made this recipe and I used a pink pigment and white swirl pattern - the white swirl turned gray, has that happened to anyone??
Why ar there so many hate comments about Acne?
I WANNA watch IT knowing IM not going to MAKE IT.       Btw ignore all the acne COMMENTS THERES a SEA full of them.
Considering the consistency why wouldn't you toss it in the fridge to harden before shaping it? It looks like cookie dough. I usually toss dough in the fridge since it melts in your hands. If your bubbly bar was cold you can shape it better. Also you can buy a heat gun cheap at harbor freight cheaper without shipping costs.
I know this video is old, but I find them so helpful. Thanks! You’re awesome ❤️
Why you don’t use the soap you made for your face it’s good in our country 🇵🇸 Palestine we use olive oil we applying on our face at night it’s removed every thing and your will be clearly gust use it sorry for my English
U should of put twine on the top to be used a a handle and look like a stem
Pls let us know how u treated ur skin now its all correct
And if you are getting paid, sponsored or even helping the other lady so what!!!  You Da Bomb thanks for all the videos 😉
Having watched this video I went and purchased this recipe. I have to say I felt robbed when I read it. Both the soap queen and thermal mermaid give away this recipe for free. It was the equivalent of $22 to buy in the uk very expensive so folks check out other sites before you buy. The weights might be different but the ratio is the same.
Thanks for demonstrating the shrink wrap!  such an important part that always gets missed!
Sorry for the bluntness but I forgot how bad your acne was, it gives me hope to see how clear your skin is now. I respect you a whole bunch for being so unapologetic about it. Much love ❤️❤️❤️
Oh my goodness! She looks so young! I’ve seen some of her old videos and this is the first time it’s hitting me that she’s so young here!
Im just asking my self why she's screaming here 😂 luv u Katie
Have u done a apple related soap?
Helpful hints:  1. That attachment is called the paddle attachment   2. That plastic piece isn’t for keeping the powders in its for making it easier to pour ingredients in 😊
1 away from 1000 had to comment.
Gorgeous
I was kinda hoping to see how it reacts with water
Love these. I would love to see you make more!
I LOVED this video! I have fallen in love with the L*** version but no longer have the disposable income to justify ever buying them... EVER! I am so excited that I might be able to make some for myself! Thank you Katie! I love your brooches on your overalls, too! You always, always make me smile!
Is it weird I kind of want to eat the soap
Cuuuupon code
Omg girl your eyes 😍
1000th comment   No one cares but i do
The powder looks like cream
Why is she yelling
I'm watching this is 2019 and I can't believe how smol Katie is!
KATIE SOUNDS SO YOUNG
What company is she talking about?
I kinda wanna eat it
Just sent this to my boyfriend! We love doing crafts and projects like this together! Hopefully he will get as excited and want to do this with me!😂
acne squad,unite!!!!
Decided this is my next Christmas gift project
So I've had a rough day and been kinda crabby. Watching your videos has been so relaxing and I'm feeling much better. Thank you ❤❤❤
She is oddly more attractive without makeup than with.
I've seen all of your newer videos and here I am leaking into the older ones... my only question is WHERE DID THIS CUTE JUMPSUIT GO???
Y’all shut up about her skin and how much a goddess she is she just wants to make soap lol
Why tf is everyone talking about her acne
Dayum, I watched this 4 years ago?! I thought it was just about a month ago
that looks like icecream when you cut it
‘Just a wee bit of glitter’ covers bar with glitter Me : well ok wow  Btw YOUR EYES ARE STUNNING
It's about 2am. I'm exhausted and still taking care of a sick rescue. I have zero plans to make soap. I have zero plans to buy fancy soap (I'm allergic to everything). Yet I am sitting here with a playlist full of your soap making videos. Thank you for the videos. The soaps are beautiful, especially the amethyst one!
That acne looks awful and painful. Get help!
Holy acne Batman
This dough thing is crazy cool
Wow,  great to see a natural and still beautiful face.
Why u scream ?
Wow i just barel6found your channel and have been watching all your new vids and every vid i always think "wow her skin is beautiful! " i would have never guessed you ever had acne and your skin is beautiful here as well! I think your stunning with and without it, i just would have never assumed you ever had acne due to how gorgeously flawless your skin is now and thats my ignorance for not knowing. Basically, you're stunning here, stunning in new vids and im so envious of your gorgeous skin lol
I now understand why you don't show your face in videos anymore.... because 90% of the comments end up being about that instead of the content of the video. I'm sorry for that.
What 4 letter Company is she talking about?
I'm amazed how much your skin has cleared up since this video and your newest 2019. You're so beautiful 😍🙏
JMO it’s NOT a diy unless I can make it after watching your video. FYI it requires a Paid Recipe!
this looks delicious if i had it id legit just take a bite out of it
I’m so happy you made these! Even the name is satisfying 🥰 wish I could buy one off of you.
I am curious to see how these bubble bars work.  Is there another video showing how they lather?  Great video though, I love your channel!
Ohhhh my gooood younger Katie! Ah I love her hair and her voice what is this
I want to eat it ughhhhhh it looks so GOOD!!!, it looks like a cookie but it is SOAP WAAAH I need to EAT it!
Just used code for 10% off
I’m binge watching your videos because I’m sick & your voice is one of few that doesn’t make me nauseous
Its called a paddle attachment
Anyone else wanna eat it???
Baby KATIE!!
Your so young here ❤️
Jeez acne much
I’m not sure if you’re insecure about your acne but you seem pretty confident about it. It looks pretty serious like cystic acne and I have friends that have struggled with that, they took the medication Acutane and now their skin is clear and beautiful. So just a suggestion, but the acne doesn’t bother me, I came for the soaps 😁😁
Girl! Lovin you wearing the acne with full confidence and not even trying to cover it! Skin is skin sometimes it goes nuts but we are human and not the kardashians! Freaking gorgeous no matter what!
2019?
*lush has left the chat*
Why do I want to eat the bubble bar, now I'm hungry
This is sooo satisfying!!
Im sorry so much but u kinda look like a zombie but ily thooo
Do you wear makeup or did you eventually over come acne because either way wow
Do you sell these??
You as a whole have matured so much in the past few years! 😳
Katie! I'm gonna need you to do this a second time! It's so fun to watch!
she sounds 25 and looks 15 not even jokin
Terrell?? Dang girl! I am your neighbor 😁 Howdy from Canton Texas!
Watching this after 4years lol
These look like sugar cookie dough and I wanna crunch..
what is it with all these comments saying she's still beautiful even without makeup i haven't seen atleast 1 hate comment
I want to eat that...
That is so satisfying.
“..flouff out..” 😝
Why were you so against saying Lush? Lol, just curious.
I love this!  Now if you could just make a Rose Jam one without all that messy, messy hot pink that gets all over, I'd love you forever!  😍🌹😘
Don’t mind me just looking through the comments to see who put the ingredients and measurements in here
I always use my blow dryer 🤣🙏  Works great -
hey what hpnd to ur face
you sound so yoooouunnng!!!
I'm disappointed that you didn't show it in action.
OMG you are so much younger here!! I can't believe I have been subscribed to you for 3 years
I'm not sure what bubble bars are? Are they actual bars of soap? Are they made with lye? I too wish she would have put them in water...but as usual a great video as all your others are.
I love these videos 😍 I have such an obsession with soap...I literally have so much soap. This is my favorite soap channel!
So I’m probably the only person that has no clue about bubble bars... I’m wondering how you use this? Do you just break a bit off and throw it in your tub? Do you need to use the whole bar? How do they work?
I wanna eat it 😥
Lush
i want to eat it stop that
Her eyes are so beautiful I didn't even notice she wasn't wearing makeup
Is it weird that I have an urge to eat that
Reminds me of kinetic sand
Am I the only one who has trouble getting off the wrapper?? Like, it's hard??  No hate intended im talking about in general
who is that 4 letter company?
Try making some fácil cleansers
Hey Katie! I'm watching in 2018 and just wanted to acknowledge how much you've grown, the style, your personality and how much better you are at explanations! Also CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR BABY IM SO EXCITED
When you were cutting the soap I just kept thinking of Nyonya kueh
Katie, I know on her Etsy page she says that one can use tapioca or corn starch, what about Arrowroot? Can it be substituted for tapioca or corn starch?
Woah Edit: I thought this was a cloud cream slime
This is really cool! I've been buying Lush bubble bars for a while & always wanted to know how to do this :) Now I feel like I can! <3
Lol, I'm going to show you how to make bubble bar but I can't tell you anything useful about the how to.
Yess no makeup gang! 👌🎉
What’s the difference between bubble bars and bath bombs? I keep trying to find videos of poeple using just the bubble bars on instagram and I’ve found nothing ;-;
Y'all don't have to make a huge statement about it, she's just existing, you don't have to pour sugary words into the comments.
Oh my god. It looks like cake. I cannot eat it (just reminding myself).
I love how you can wear no makeup without being shy, I once got one pimple and refused to go outside until it went away😍
idk if anyone was being a shithead about the acne but 1. i hope uve figured it out because it looks painful and im having sympathy pain from it but 2. mood, relatable, thank u for being Out There with it because thats cool like hell yeah i support that also if anyone was being a shithead yall realize makeup makes acne worse right lmao...
What is your opinion on ppl who make MP soaps only in their business plus making candles and Melts plus other 100% Natural products. ?
I don’t understand why you added Lye or Palm Oil
i want to eat those BARS
Love your videos it inspired me to try making a bath hamper for a Christmas present for someone :)
I made up a resipe that only has 2 ingredients and works really well and it’s under 10 dollars
Either your makeup got better or your acne cleared up cause in newer videos you look much better.
I love watching the shrink wrapping
Damn.....why can't my eyes look like that?!?😭😜
Just being nice, have you ever heard of  “Differin Gel” to treat really strong acne! I’ve heard it’s REALLY good and you can get it at Target, it used to only be able to be givin by prescription by dermatologist! Just a thought!:) you still look pretty either way!
Can you make fall bubble bars?
Her skin makes you wonder about the soaps tho... I’m not even wanting to be mean, I’m just saying. I can’t be the only one...
Awww! Your poor face! I have  bad acne too though. It's cool you have the confidence to show your face when it was kind of broken out in acne. I think it's awesome you did that! Super cool soaps too!  ♥
Elf face/skin products work the best for acne
Acne?
These taste horrible
its cool on how she is so comfortable with her fans to let us she her beautiful natural face, its amazing to she your confidence <3 it gives me hope that i could push myself to do the same
I have never seen one of these in my entire life
Did you ever leave a discount code??
Thanks for sharing..
Off topic but you've got the brightest eyes
I watched the video twice. Love it btw,..ty Katie. Did I miss the coupon code for the bubble bar recipe?
0:38
how bubbly are these? do they foam up a lot? is there a good link to see how they perform after following this recipe?  Thanks to anyone who can share the info!  Thanks for making this video - it's actually MORE helpful that you don't make this kind of product a lot - since WE are amateurs, it's good to know that, although you have expertise that makes you a person who understands the general field of soap, that as someone who DOESN'T make this kind of thing all the time, you found it an easy recipe and instructions to follow.  Thanks! Esp for the discount code!
OMG. Your eyecolor is so stunning! Help I can’t get over it!  I think your bubblebar looks great too! And I hope it bubbles as hard as it supposed to bubble!!
I love your skin soooooo beautiful girl I don't wear makeup and I respect how brave you are  luv u girl
youre gorgeous
i think u can say lush
reeeee i really wanna try this but i’ll mess up so easily
I've seen about 60 comments freaking out about "all the hate comments" and not a single actual hate comment???
Very old video but just letting everyone know that bubble bars are indeed trademarked as well as patented by lush cosmetics so any attempt to sell these would be illegal.
You are still sooooo pretty even without makeup.♥️♥️
You should recreate this
You should do a time lapse of you just shrink wrap packaging soaps and other products. I would LIVE for that <33
*shivers* green glitter..... the DEVIL
I kind of wanna eat it
I wanna eat it
Makeup never hurt anyone.. you should seriously go to a dermatologist though girl
What is on your face?
Am I the only one who thinks when people take the time to tell you you look beautiful to be nice when you’re OBVIOUSLY not having your most beautiful day that it really only draws more attention to the fact that you’re not having your most beautiful day? It’s like they assumed I cared and I was bothered by my appearance or that I really take others’ opinions that much to heart that it’s all I can manage to think about so I need their reassurance. I get they’re just trying to be nice though, so I will never complain, just throwing it out there. That’s me. 😬 On behalf of all the insecure individuals, thanks for being so courageous and showing the world you don’t give a heck. I love your videos!
Good grief you are screaming in this video lol.
Whatever that jumpsuit coat thing is... I love it pls tell us where you got it cuz u wear it alot
Do you have a brother that makes videos
The bubble bar looks like cookie dough.
securered
What company is she talking about
Whyyyyy... Why are you so pretty
For your acne I have a recommendation and it’s called noxema
Why would ppl comment on her skin? This video is about soap, fuxk off haters
You  are pretty no matter what ily
Makeup just ruins your skin anyway. Society has influenced people to think acne is bad or ugly, and you need to cover it up. That is wrong, you broke the influence. Great job, you go girl!
Hey please please please make a lavender lemon soap because my friend lloovvesss lavender and lemon together and I love my friend pls pls pls 💖
This is DIY bubble bars.. You need to show us what ingredients, how to put them/mix them together... You should show us EVERYTHING
I love her shirt
I love how she used 2 tints of color
I want to eat it
These bubble soaps when cut look like ice cream
1. Thanks for sharing this recipie, I love it! I wish i had as much talent as you💜 2. YASS GURL EMBRACE YOUR FACE 💜 3. Your voice is soothing -w-💜
You can't copyright a recipe.
Did you go to school to learn how to make soap or did you learn by trial and error?
i know people are saying well done for not wearing makeup but sorry that skin is nasty
I want to eat it.
i want to start a soap business now
You cant copyright a recipe... you can copyright the specific way you wrote up the recipe like "stir in a counter clockwise motion" and how you spelled it out and stylized the actual writing (bullet points? paragraph spacing?). Only the creative *writing* gets copyright.  But the actual weights/amounts/ingredients? Nope. Not subject to copyright protection.
Girl time to wash you’re face 😂
Omg im so sorry about ur face
Better than lush 😉
I have to admit I gave up on "that 4 letter company" because of their dwindling product sizing and slowly expanding price. Glad to see these can be homemade, I know a couple of friends who would chip in for a bubble bar making night
Holly shit she is so fucking cute! And her eyes are just jaw dropping .
Pore girl had acne 💖
IM SO LATE BUT YOUR EEEYYYEEESSSSS
lush is a really good company and i don't think you should have dug into them like you did.
Make equestrian soap.
I am sorry for my rude comment earlier.
So is the acne for using the soap 🤷🏻‍♀️
discount code; 10:08
It looks just like desert.  Just beautiful. You’re so talented I love watching your videos
This comment section is absolute garbage. Everyone who is commenting on her looks, no matter if its about how she is "brave and beautiful" or "acne???" Should fuck off. You guys are shallow, just treat her how you would treat her normally. Reassuring how beautiful she is degrading, she isn't an insecure teenage girl.
I wish I could eat them
I am seeing " sorry for hurtful comments" but seeing only, "you're so beautiful!"
Thanks@!~   &  cheers lovely soaper@!~
Satisfying.
U just made me wanna show the entire world my skin, ive been insecure for so long because of my acne but i love how confident you are. My Queen ❤️❤️
Hi! Do you have to put these in the fridge at all? Would that help the bars hold together a little better?
Can you use your KITCHEN Kitchenaid with the SLSA & Poly-80? (ie, still use it for food after)
You’re so beautiful! And crafty too... perfect woman 12/10
I've been binge watching these videos since last night 🙄🤦🏼‍♀️❤️😂
I'm not a fan of those air tight packages because they are a bit of a pain to cut!
I’m seeing all these comments like “stop hateing on her acne! She wears it proudly!” When I haven’t seen 1 hate comment
I’ve never heard of bubble bars until this vid. They sound fun lol.
*the company that shall not be named.*
Oh these are so cute! Thank you for sharing!
I am sorry for my rude comment I posted before. I like your videos.
Also, once the pdf is purchased are you allowed to sell bars made from her recipe?
Does this recipe contain surfactants?
why is there a war in the comment section?
These seem really cool! Ive never used one, i should make them someday
You kinda look like paris jackson like the more i look at you i can see it
im so hungry now hhHHN
I know i am late to the comments but whay bothers me is people asking her to wear make up. People who have break outs like me, i think should avoid mske up. It makes me irritated to see people cover their break outs with tons of foundation. I think it causes more break out and the skin doesn't heal, i mean do you know how my harmful chemicals in it. So no no make up.
You're so great, such an inspiration for me. <3
After testing out the bubble bar I noticed it didn't color the bath water! Would anyone happen to know why this might be? It's oil based mica so should I have activated it in some oil before adding it to the mixture?
Your so pretty don’t listen to haters your pretty and I’m proud of you for showing the real beauty in you not the kind you force there
You are so pretty I’m not lying
You are beautiful and hilarious, I love how your personality comes through in your videos. I feel like I know you!! (And I we'd be besties)
4:35 4:36
😭 Wanted to see how well it worked.. Especially before getting the recipe
I hate u and hate lush omg
wow ur skin has came so far ...u look beautiful both ways though 🤗🌻🌻
Heh floof
I don’t get how it’s helpful if nobody knows the ingredients.
Thanks!  I can't wait to buy this recipe.  I was wondering if you would show us one in water?  Are these the same as bath bombs?  You are amazing and soooo much fun to learn from.  Keep up the good work!!
You sound like bunny
is that a Nevada pin
I want to eat them😟😋
I actually used a recipe formulated by a young girl that did not use slsa, and who formulated other lush dupes. that's cool it's copyrighted, but that means not putting the ingredients on the ingredient label should one choose to sell them. some people have skin allergies, and need to know what's in their products. the videos the young lady made were great for a dupes, and so were the end result of her take on the lush bubble bar. I'll probably make a video and link her original video in it.
I use store bought bubble bath because it's cheap and convenient does the trick that's all the matters !
Thank gou 😀😀😀😀😀
😮 I had no idea how pretty you were.
you're so pretty 💖💖
no hate but cosmetic grade glitter is still plastic and should not be added to a bubble bar, its bad for the water supply and doesnt degrade over time.
I want to bite into one of these bars like a pastry
I want to eat it
I like you just how you are. And the candles r soo pretty
bubble bars are trademarked and patented by lush💕 be careful selling those 😉
I'm not sure how I feel about putting candle fragrance in bubble     bar???..???
Poor baby. U should be using Noxema
Anyone who is subbed to Glam and Gore aka Mykie flinched as soon as she said "Green Glitter"
DIY😏 omg I can totally do this at home because I have all of the ingredients in my cupboard 😒🙄
cute face💫
Is it wrong that i wanna eat that? Its almost like tide pods
Omg I am so making these!!
I think it’s great you went out of your way to make something out of your comfort zone for your viewers.
Man this makes me want to make soap
I wanna eat one.
Wow put some fucking makeup on, I can barely concentrate on the video bc your pizza face is so distracting.
I really hope this doesn't come across the wrong way, but I love your acne. That it's there, and you don't even acknowledge it or apologize for it. You are so beautiful, and it shines through in your happy smile, voice, and you literally ooze confidence. I appreciate all of the hard work you put into your very high quality product, but even more-so the hours upon hours dedicated to filming, editing, planning and uploading! Give yourself a pat on the back Sugar Cube!!! And thank you so much for taking the time to teach about something you love. :)
This might sound weird but you have really prettt eyes:)
Please stop recommending what she should use for her acne, everyone has a different skin type and I'm sure she has her own products and routine.
I thought you made avocados in the thumbnail
Oh my god, your hair is such a pretty color!!
Her eyes are gorgeous.
I'm not trying to be rude but did something happen to her face or is that acne? If that's acne, why would anyone use her soap recipes?
Subbed, BTW
I would have loved to have seen one of these bath bars in action. Maybe show your products in action? Otherwise, great job. :)
And this is why you get cancer PEOPLE!!
Shouldn't use toxic crap in your soap. Those fragrances are SO bad for you. Choose organic essential oils, or go fragrance free. Chemicals also affect OTHERS and we do NOT appreciate the toxic onslaught I can assure you.
Will the soap bar still work if you used the bars before they were dry? Like crumbling the doughy soap into the tub, etc..? That cookie dough texture is really appealing to me! Kinda like kinetic sand, lol...
I was thinking of posting those mean "funny" comments to see how many likes I could get but then I realized that I am just going to become a bully. Don't be like me, be a nice person
I don't really make soap, but I love your energy!
It looks squishy and I kinda wanna eat it. It looks like it would feel like a marshmallow
Her face is what happens when you use her shit soap
This soap looks disturbingly delicious. I feel like if I got one I would end up on the news because I died eating it.
LOL I love your line " there has to be an easier way!" love your videos!
its funny how she makes soap
You're so cute!!!!
Why are cooks so mean? THEY BEAT THE EGGS AND WHIP THE CREAM
I WANT TO EAT THOSE SOAPS XD THEY LOOK DELICIOUS
0:40 lol raising the roof with them brows gurllll GET IT GURLL XD
what is that background noise? sounds like waves or something. really annoying
I love how she's so confident with the way she is. Very very beautiful. Confidence is the best kind of beauty.
Might help if you freeze it. Kinda like pie crust
What product do you use for your acne because my acne is starting to pattern out in the same area around my chin.
I'm addicted to just watching you make them 😂
Another great video! Thank you for your energy, enthusiasm and honesty. You bring joy to my day
A 'wee' bit of glitter LOL
Is there a connection to this soap and acne?  I am not trying to be crass but, if she uses her own product and suffers from acne maybe there is a connection or reaction she is having.
How do you market these bars? More as a soap, or a bath bomb, or bubble bath? I think they are so fun, but if someone has never seen one before , as a customer at a craft show, whats a fun way to describe them?
She is so beautiful 😍
Does the heat gun for shrink wrapping not melt the bubble bars and soaps?
WHY ARE YOU YELLINGGGGGG
Why are people talking about anything other than bubble bars? Weird priorities.
At least she has better eyebrows than me...
It is a good idea to have separate mixer parts just for making soap.  You do not want to use the same bowl or wisk for food.
Cosmetic grade glitter... is that the same as loose glitter for your eyes?
LOVE your pins!
Does the mica stain bath tubs?
I've heard your supposed to mix the mica in with the dry ingredients
Your older videos are SO inspiring to me. I adore your channel and everything you've done. I can only hope to get over my anxiety about making soap and get back to doing it again.
So cool
Omg you sound like dory!
UR EYES R SO PRETTY :U U R SEA GODDESS WHO GIFTS US WITH GOOD SMELLY THINGS
i gotta say, seein someone else with acne/sores (and wearing it proudly) makes me feel better about my own <3
Love the made up words you use I do the same lol "floof"
This is awesome Katie. I love all of your video's. As soon as I am done watching this, I will be going over to ETSY ;)
i like our courage , and i admire you !
do  a demo
Is the glycerine powder or liquid
my fave bubble bar recapie is corn flour and any soap or shower gel and that's it mix until it's a dough and then leave to dry for about two days and it's perfect or don't wait for it to dry for a fun bubble bath dough
There's acne.. and theres looking like your face got mauled by a lion.
You can call this the Granny's House Bubble Bar!
OML ITS JUST ACNE STOP MAKING A FIT ABOUT IT IT HAPPENS.
I wear makeup regularly however people talking shit bc she isn't wearing any is just plain insane. she is beautiful without it. and we as women shouldn't put down other women or have to wear makeup every second of our lives. plus this video isn't even about makeup it's about making something.
A Ying Yang pattern would be SO cool!
She's really pretty.
her eyes are freaking stunning great video me and my little sister will try it out
Ugh I wish you would've shared the recipe cause "this wax" is vague.
98%of the comments are defending her from people telling her she's ugly 1% actually rude comments everyone hates 1% "other" aka me
Looks like cheesecake on the inside hehe
Do you really have to wrap them in plastic or will they still stay good/fresh if you don't?
I love how she isn't scared to show her face and wear a cake face of makeup!! She is so beautiful and has such a fun personality
70% of comments: Freaking out about the rude comments 10% of comments: Hate 20% of comments: About the actual video No hate, she is flipping gorgeous, but the statistics of the comments are kinda funny.
Can everyone just stop commenting about her face overall? Sheesh
Thankyou! I want to try your jelly soap one too 😍🛀
This looks edible......  It would not be pleasant to eat.
Love the video!  One thing that could have been added - how to use it. I don't have a bathtub so don't have any idea how to use it (portion of a bar/half/whole thing?). Looks like a fun item for Christmas presents!
Am I the only one that clicked on this thinking it was food? Now the bubble in the title makes sense haha It looked so yummy.
everyone is commenting about her face, while I'm here like, "Oh my gosh, I found a fellow person who doesn't wear makeup to cover their acne! :D" I don't wear makeup unless it's Halloween.
could also go watch soap queen TV's recipe. includes measurements and products
I love your voice and body action
You are so much fun to watch! Thanks for the diy! Im gonna make some for my sisters!
i tought they where making candy 😢
"So nothing sorta floofs in to the  air" XD Love you!!!
It's very thoughtful that you havent given out the recipe for free and are making sure people pay the original recipe maker and got a discount to encourage people to support her. It's nice to see creators supporting other creators!
Okay but I thought this was cake for some reason when I clicked it but soap is a good time.
Everyone one is commenting about her face, I'm just kinda irritated with the amount of pins she has on her jacket thing.
I'm coming not try to be mean but her face is breaking out
Is the four letter company Lush?
why are u yelling? ---
why is lush censored in the description
everybody is like "don't complain about her face" but there's more lf those then the actual complaining comments so there's nothing to reply to anymore... (I don't care that she doesn't have make up on she looks pretty with and without)
The shadeeeeee 😂😂😂😂😂😂 I love it
In the first ten second I was already loving this channel. Subscribed.
I love her without makeup and they should make an acne emoji. Like if u agree
It looks like lime sherbet =) 😋 yummy ♥
You are so so pretty! I'm just wondering though, what happened to your face(I'm sorry if this sounds rude I'm not trying to be!) is it acney? I don't mind it! I have a weird thing for acney faces.I'm sorry! This sounds so rude but I don't mean it to be seriously.
O my lord Ive been so used to people wearing an inch of makeup on their face, I was slightly surprised that she wasnt wearing makeup, especially because shes a beauty youtuber
OMG your eyes are gorgeous! I hate my plain jane brown eyes. Simply lovely!
floofs out or floooofs out 😂 I will make this thanks!
how do you prevent crackage?
Forgive me for being so blunt but your acne is honestly so refreshing. Thank you so much for showing us your skin without interference, it gives me confidence to do the same.
you could talking about healthcare in the us and id still enjoy listening to you talk.
You're freakin gorgeous and I love the way you talk!
This recipe is 30$ Canadian?!?!!?!!? Wtf
she reminds me of my sister lmao
watching her flail around at 1:03 made me realize that she kinda looks like tobey maguire
Thank you so much for sharing this! I can't wait to make some of these for my friends and family😝😝
You're beautiful ❤️
where did you get the shrink wrap sealer?
Just subscribed going to watch all your videos
She's beautiful I had a thousand times worse skin & after I got through my teen years my skin was great & the guys who picked on me started to hit on me. You can imagine how bad I rejected them
i looked at bramble berry and the ingredients cost $77.50
awesome recipe! im so glad you made these! would you recommend this for a beginner soap maker?
I know you must be sick of hearing this, but I really like that you aren't wearing makeup. It's refreshing.
Thank you for self-confidence.
you should cover that acne with some makeup and show respect to your fans. that american style ( i love my self ) is wrong! try to look good when a lot of people watching you
I love how she is so confidant and don't care about how she looks in front of the camera at least she's got clothes on and have great ideas to share
Does anyone else cringe when butters n oils are heated in the microwave? But great video. Later for the ppl focused on her skin. She's beautiful and her personality is awesome.
"A wee bit of glitter." * covers entire bar in tons of glitter * Me-"Well okay then."
I love your videos.........but I want to know what to do if I got nasty pimples or as some would call it zits? Cause I always get zits only on one side of my face and my parents tell me to leave the thing alone but I always end up getting deep scars even without touching it..........can you give me advice or point me to a video you have done?
I gotcha
fantastic personality. thanks for sharing.
Hi Dear, Where Did you purchase your shrink bags and shrink sealer from? I really need to know that I may purchase them. Thank You,  Kimm
wht is bubbe soap used for
Duchess Katie, This is a blast from the past.  What is the shelf life for the Bubble Bars?
How long are they good for in humid temperatures if not packaged or wrapped?
This is kind of hilarious. There's like 99.9% of these comments that are anti hate, but I'm scrolling and scrolling, and I can't find any hate. Meaning that there's probably like .1% MAYBE
i
Love your videos. Thanks
I think it would be cool if you would demo them in a large bowl of water.
I see more people bitching about people saying stuff about her face, than I do actually people saying stuff about her face.
Why can't she just tell us the ingredients
Floofs
Those bubble bars look so nice 😍
I know this is old but I love the fact that she's comfortable enough with herself that she isn't wearing makeup. I don't care if she wears it or not but she's awesome for being able to not wear it. That doesn't mean wearing makeup doesn't make you awesome
Just ordered the recipe and small kit can't wait to try it!
u need proactive
301st
Im really not trying to be mean, but do u have acne or something? ( Dont worry i do too )
WATER THE POWDERED INGREDIENTS
You seem like the girl everyone loves to hang out with!!
1 cup cornstarch.  1/2 shampoo/body wash  step one  mix  done. it ain't that hard
I wish there was a demo of how it bubbled up ;-;
Thank you! I enjoy your videos so much :)
The best thing about lush bubble bars is that they're naked, no plastic ending up in the landfill plus their glitter is made of seaweed so it doesn't harm oceans, lakes and rivers like normal plastic base glitter does. Still cool though :)
The code is royaltysoap or royaltysoaps  for ten percent off
Thank you so much, Katie!  I love your videos and always learn so much :-)
It is definitely worth buying it.Good video never mind the cruel morons talking crap. Smile because they took time out there day because you are that important.Just 🖐 and say Hi haters😂
Starts at 2:18 your welcome
Umm.. it's not butter that you get from animal milk,  people.. it's butter from a plant, probably cocoa,or mango seed, or shea
NOTE MADE OCTOBER 2016 - PLEASE READ - ( GLITTER INFO AND COUPON CODE INFO INCLUDED )  RECIPE - So, I feel I should say that DIY stands for "Do It Yourself" not "Free Recipe for Bath Products". lol I made a video that helps people create their own bubble bars at home! I don't make any money if you purchase the recipe (not even a dime) because the recipe isn't mine and I am only promoting it because it was the best one I could find. This is not your typical cornstarch + body wash recipe. I wanted ta TRUE DIY, where you make everything yourself and have control over the raw ingredients, as plenty of body washes don't contain eco-friendly, vegetarian components.   Yes. You have to pay for the recipe, but think about it this way. If you use a recipe you find online via a craft website, DIY blog, etc. you will still have to invest in all of the raw ingredients to make the bubble bars. But what if that batch fails? You just wasted $10.00 So, you go try another free recipe. That one also fails. There goes another $10.00. That's $20 in raw materials wasted that you could have spent on the recipe that won't fail. Raw materials for bubble bars aren't cheap enough for you to just keep throwing them away. Also, let's not forget how we feel when our batches keep flopping. haha SO I did all the failing for you! I tried all the free recipes, I wasted all the materials, and FINALLY, when I thought I would never be able to make these suckers, I found Nicole's recipe, a fail-proof thing of beauty that she spent so much time and money on perfecting and creating. The $20 you're spending on the recipe you're saving in raw materials PLUS you are paying a mom of two Down Syndrome children for her hard work. Hard work deserves to be rewarded and I am more than willing to support a wife, mother, female entrepreneur, and artisan for her dedication to the craft and kick-butt recipe that saves me time and money!  GLITTER - As far as biodegradable glitter is concerned, you can purchase that right here if it's important to you! (and again, I don't make any money if you do!) :D - https://nurturesoap.com/collections/biodegradable-glitter  COUPON - The coupon code in the video is now expired. However, I have heard that Nicole is still honoring it if you private message her on Etsy mentioning this video and the original code. :)  Thanks for reading and I hope you find this information helpful! Have an absolutely awesome day and have fun creating bath products and enjoying them too! xoxo
Hi Katie.... just one thing I noticed watching your tutorial, I have purchased the recipe from Nicole, and one that recipe we have got only 4 fluid ingredients! Maybe you added something extra... well I thought I pin it on your busy board! Thank Katie!! Ta ta!!!! X
When I use mica powders in the bath it just sits on the top of the water & generally  makes a mess. Is yours a special type of mica or do you add something to make it disperse better?
Hun you have some bad acne I recondition to put some moisturiser on them
Can you replicate the scent from the lush bubble bar 'the comforter'? it's amazing! i would totally buy this in soap form!!
Are you British ? Because it's a British word I thought you misspelled shit .. Thought it was a typo😂
Not in the sentence you used it in..you ment shit and there's only one way to spell shit...😂 what was your meaning supposed to be?
would this coupon be used on your total order or just this recipe?
I love how she makes these videos about products that originated from that "four letter word company" but at the same time practically bashes them at the same time. I wanna know what happened between her and them. Lmao. What. Is. The. Drama.
hmm $20 recipe + supplies or $10 bubble bar... sorry but I'd rather spend $50 at lush than $100s on supplies to make my own at home. time is money plus I'm not like a super lush addict so I probably wouldn't go back any time soon lol
i love how u r sooo confident without makeup!!! im 12 and i deal with acne as well but i would never have enough confidence to put mysrelf out here in the harsh world!!! u r inspirational!!!
Omg I love bubble bars, and I love Lush! This is really amazing! I wish Ihad the money to buy the recipe and ingredients for it!
🗯🆒🛀🏽♿️!!!
I use Nicole's recipe also and my customers love it. It is the best.
I have formulated a reusable bubble bar like the 4 letter company makes wink wink lol It's a 5 oz bar and it gives you 12 bubble baths :D
lavender pineapple would be awesome or coconut lime! I gotta try this!
she copyrighted a recipe that someone else i.e. "Lush" originated!
I hope that glitter was degradable in water. Plastic glitter kills fishes!
Holy cow your eyes 😍
Omg! I just found this channel and so many negative comments about her! Why is it such a sin that she has acne or that she's not wearing makeup....! I apologize for the the hate! You're beautiful 💖
bishhhh wheres the drop ????
oh my god, seeing this cut is so satisfying.
Thanks for the video.....I purchased this recipe and cannot wait to try it.
I don't want butter in my bath. Sorry, Paula Deen.
Hi, great video. Thank you. I might purchase the recipe since I'm still struggling to get this recipe right.  Do you think we could put this in a mold to shape it?
What happened to her face it wasn't like that before
Beautiful and easy method.👍
I'm on a facebook group for soap and they suggested you, do u have a beginners video I can watch?
Does the Mica change the color of your water or not so much?
" FLUUUFFS out into the air!!! "lol
OMG!! I am soooo excited to make these. I'll go buy her recipe and make some of these woooo!!   Side note: Why is everybody so rude? I had really bad acne from age 20-25 and I would have been mortified to hear some of the BS people are saying. (Mine was WAY worse than yours) Props to you for giving zero f**ks. Turns out it was my diet and lifestyle. Milk, sleeping in my make up, alcohol, and energy drinks being the main aggravators. Thanks for sharing your knowledge!
you're really pretty and quite funny
Ok hellooo she's fucking gorgeous and seems like a nice person. So shut up about acne and focus on the point of the video. Love the video girl :) btw.
Thank you so much for the video. It convinced me to buy the recipe from Nicole. I not only purchased the Bubble Bar recipe, I also got the Bubble Bath Bomb Cupcakes. These are excellent recipes, and nothing like the recipes I have tried out from various sources. Read this: NO MORE WASTED INGREDIENTS!!! :-)
Quick question:  this coupon doesn't work for some reason has it expired?
<3 Love you and your videos!
Just found your videos and I love them!  💕
great video. only thing missing Is I wish you had showed how it looks when you put it in water.  thank you for the vid
It doesn't have to be perfect she needs to calm down.....bath bombs dont have to be perfect no bath bomb looks perfect
How are you so beautiful?!? I love you!! I wish I could be as confident as you are! You are a inspiration to me, because you don't let all this hate get to you! Forget the haters, beauty is in your personality and your looks are just a bonus! Stay beautiful! ❤️
Hey! Not intended to be rude but rather, my friend has really bad acne, similar to yours and his dermatologist put him on isotretinoin. You should speak to your dermatologist and see if that will help (:
I love your videos! YOU'RE HILARIOUS!!! lol  I have literally gone in my kitchen and started baking goodies because I watched your videos....you must be stopped JK lol THANKS!! :)
When did it become a sin to not wear makeup????? She can do whatever she wants, shes beautiful how she is.
From lush
Could you make porige sop
Lovely, thanks for sharing!
her face…
I purchased Two Wild Hares BubbleBar recipe and it worked great!😄  Pics coming
if I wanted to add sodium Lactate cam I subtract the amount from my glycerine?
Leonarda loved this video.
I love that she isn't wearing makeup like EVERY FREAKING PERSON!!  She is beautiful and I admire her very much <3
in the description, why did you put "L*SH"?
OMG THIS IS GREAT AND ITS SO PRETTY
This is a great video! Thanks for sharing!
Woo yea your awesome!!!!
my a Yong teen and would like to sell my soap where would be a good place
Omg I want to buy everything!
"four letter enthusiast" ahah i loved you im going to suscribe
It would have been even better to see how well it bubbles. :(
I love that you're so straight to the point when making your soaps. Makes it easy to watch! I can barely get through some other videos people have posted xD
Oh man. I've made bubble bar's once. You didn't talk about ingredients but one must be a foaming/bubbling agent. When I made mine i just opened the bag of that nasty stuff and immediately started coughing. Then I ended up breathing through a t-shirt to get through the mixing phase until all of the wet ingredients were incorporated. Kept coughing for probably 20 minutes after this horrible experience. Then 2nd batch I bought a dust mask and soo much better. You're lucky whatever foaming agent you use doesn't cause you to cough profusely unless you are wearing a dust mask. It's a super good idea to wear one, that stuff is nasty.
The code doesn't work. It must of had an expiry date on it.
I think, no I know I have watched every one of your videos. Great job on all of them. This one is very good. You take your time to show how its done. Especially the rolling! :)
Thanks for the info, I cant wait to try it out and thanks for all your videos you are talented :)
your face and voice is so adorable oh my gosh SLAY
I'm sorry for all the hurtful comments :(
buy a book called Make it Fizz.  Has a great recipe in there.
I watched this video all the way through and I didn't get the discount code to purchase the recipe.  Can you share that code again?
I've watched this three times.. Why can't I find the coupon?! :S
What is the machine you used to seal the baggies at the end?
zinc for acne and bentonite clay mask works miracles for skin. i have a recipe on my video. if you're interested. i habe the same problem amd I'm over 40. i hate it. kist advice because i know how it feels to go through it.
A. Thanks for this video. I've been on the hunt for a decent recipe. I know it's not yours, but watching it be made is a huge help. I will be buying her recipe!  B. Your eyes are stunning! And you talk with great clarity. You don't stumble on your words, which makes watching a 15min video, so much easier :) C. Can't wait (so I won't) to check out more of your videos!
i know the recipe is copyrighted, and thats FINE. can you or someone else who purchased the recipe just tell me IF this recipe has SLSA? im looking for possible alternatives and dont want.to purchase this recipe if it includes it. thanks!
how much did this cost compared to other recipes?
Looks like they could be shaped into a heart too. You are a darling. :)
hi, I love your videos. I live watching u make all of the Soaps. it's so fun
Hi sweetheart, been following your videos for awhile, you are a very talented soaper :-)  I seen a few comments posted regarding your skin, and I just wanted to mention that if you know it's hormonal, try DIM and/or Holy Basil.  Your beauty isn't phased at all, your bright personality and self confidence is inspiring :-)  Keep soapin girlfriend, from one soaper to another - you rock ;-)
There are no comments? How can there be no comments on this awesome video!? lol!
Thank you Katie👍🏻  Bianka
Hi Katie love your videos😊 where is the code for the percentage? I didn't hear you say it. Would you please tell me so I can buy her recipe
good job will defanantly try this!!
@royalty soaps - for your acne you should try benza gel -  or murad they both work amazing!! saved my beauty - i will be buying this bubble bar
another great and entertaining video!  You are the best!
Love this!  I downloaded recipe and my little girls can't wait for me to make them!  Her instructions are awesome!  Totally worth the money.I got her bath bomb one too.  Haha.
Oops...did I miss the coupon code? Golly...
I just got into your videos and I think I have watched almost everyone of them. I have not started making soap yet but I definitely plan on it. I am currently taking over my Moms candle business but focusing more on wax tarts. i LOVE your videos. a Are you going to be doing any more anytime soon. You are so personal and I just love watching you. Keep going girl!!
Thank you, Katie! I'm introducing my creations ar our weekly Arts & Crafts Market tomorrow! Loved making them--reminded me of my Polymer clay creations from years gone by! Keep up the great work!
Mmm the problem with buying this persons work is that stuff tends not to be the same overseas. Can be frustrating when everything is written for what is on sale in America with American names :/
Thanks for another very informative video.  Tell me, what exactly is the difference btwn bubble bars and bath bombs?  Which is easier to make (I hear bath bombs are quite temperamental)?  Is it just the texture/shape that's different?  They seem very similar to me but I've been reluctant to try bath bombs because I've seen so many people say what a pain they are to make.  This doesn't look so hard.
500th like! Where's my cookie??!!
This was great Katie! Thanks for sharing all your expertise and love of bath and body products! We know you don't have a problem with Lush, it's just nice to have an alternative! <3
You know that four letter word? Lol.
Loved this video!
Loved this video!
Do you use your soap? Does it affect your face like that? no rudeness intended!
whats your problem with lush? Its expensive because all their products are handmade with fresh ingredients and they actually pay their farmers and workers a decent amount. Not to mention how much charity work and awareness events that they do.
Where can I get the receipt 😖 I can't find it
Will you be selling these?
Maaaybe you should use some acne cream :O I am not trying to be rude but, please. :0
you did a great job... I like the way you did the colors and they way you packaged them, they look fun to make !!! :)
Great video. Its so nice how honest you are about finding the best recipie and they look like so much fun to make!
You should warned people that these bars are not for eating. They look good enough to eat. ^_^
I struggled with the same problem sweetie i hope you are able to fix it cause it is annoying . But you are a lovely person inside and out ! For me i tried so many products from my dermatologist and in the end i tried cupping to fix my hormones and now apply olive oil on my face and its worked .   Good luck with it all   G'day from W.A ( Western Australia)
Darling why are u struggling with your skin ? Stop using soap products and slap some olive oil on your face to tame the sebum beasts.  Love ur videos !  G'day from W.A ( Western Australia)
Oh yeah, go to walmart and get yourself a Haer air conditioner. Mine has a built in dehumidifier in it. Works great!
Hi Katie, Where did you get your shrink wrap sealer? I want one for my birthday!
Hi Katie I'm just curious on how this recipe compares to the Soap Queens solid bubble bath recipe, I just recently made a batch with her recipe and I'm waiting until they fully harden to try them. I was curious if you have tried that one and what you think about both if so!! Thanks!!!
Why do you hate LUSH?
The recipe does not appear to be available anymore, at least I am not finding it.
OMG you are so fun!!!  My granddaughter wanted some bubbles in her bath bombs and now I can make her bubble soap.  Yay!!   Thank you.  Going to two wild Hares.
In addition to the recipe that you purchased, how much did it all the supplies cost to make this?
Could you please show the bars in action, the amount of bubbles you get from these bars.
Wait, what's the coupon code?
Great Video - Thanks
you are awesome
Thank you! that was so awesome!
Thanks Katie u are the best
You are too funny lol
Did i miss the discount code
Thank You So Much For Such An Awesome Share!! :-)
Watching you make soaps and stuff is so satisfying to watch!!   Does anyone know of a good way to promote a new channel without being too pushy or annoying? I hate to be that person, but I would love to get my channel out there!
They look great!
THANK YOU!!!!!!!!
I just love your videos!!! Can't wait to make these!!
This is SUPER helpful! I have been trying different recipes for months now and I can't come up with a good one. Definitely buying her recipe!
Everything you make looks so tasty xD
I have this recipe and is very good!!! LOVE IT!  Wow Katie, you did a great job!!!
You sold me - heading over the Two Wild Hares (gotta love that name) to pick up the recipe.  I hadn't had the courage to try a bubble bar after making bath bombs which were tricky enough. This looks possible !  Thanks, Miss Katie <3
Have you actually used one in the tub? Are the bubbles as soft and long lasting as the L*SH bubble bars?
Bought this recipe from Nicole a few months ago and it paid for itself the first time I made it and sold out of the bars. Foolproof recipe, works every time. So glad you did this video Katie to show people just how easy it is to make these. And thank you Nicole for all your hard work and figuring out a great recipe!!
Thank you Katie!
They kinda look like ice cream
I must have missed the discount code somewhere..... Great Video.
You rock Katie 😀
Thank you so much  ! ! !  Looks wonderful! I am so going to her !!!
I believe this could be treated like cookie dough. Some doughs are rolled into a log and chilled before they're cut. Do you think refrigeration would make it easier to cut?
Congrats on 24k!!
i've watched sooo many bubble bar vids where you need so many different types of expensive ingredients and as a money-pinched teen starting to want to dip my toes into the soaping and bath product world i was kinda discouraged by all that. thank you so much for sharing this less expensive alternative with us! maybe i'll finally get to make some bubble bars!!! <333
If I could like this 1000 times I would. I've been waiting for this video~ squeeeee~~~
