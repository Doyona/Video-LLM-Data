Thank you for sharing your recipe.  Can I use frozen pandan leaves?
I have tried some of your recipes. I love it. May I request for kueh ko swee recipe as it's my niece favourite? Thank you.
Hi,  can i check,  the 300g of flour is the weight after bake?  Cos i found that after i bake,  flour only weights 150g. Thanks to advice

Thank you for very detail sharing😄
I have never baked before cny kuey kuey,, and I’m tak it to do it... I but I really wanna eat all these delicious kuey since France tak ada sell.  I will give it a try 🤞🏻💖
I hv just tried yr recipe , turned out ok but just that it does not melt in the mouth
I just made it but its turn out chewy not crispy or melt in mouth 🤔
I used the fresh coconut cream and it work well too :)
Hi , can I use 'santan'? I dun like the packet coconut (kind of taste and smell funny) to me
I don't have pandan leaves here is that ok
When baking the flour do you need to stir it from time to time?
Hi Grace, please change the temperature from 120 C to 150 C for your printed recipe.   I used the printed recipe and my Bangkit won't bangkit due to the wrong temperature. 😓
You look so young and good baker❤️, I will try your recipes, thanks.
My experience: it had a strong egg flavor, and you can also taste the starch, it has a hint of coconut but just a little bit.  It didn't work for me.  I hope this helps someone in the future :)
This looks like a curious delicacy. What does this taste like? Does it taste like coconut shortbread or something like that? I've never eaten cookies like that before.
Try ah lulu hoon
Impressive!
Tried baking it today but the cookies turned out chewy.
Dear I don't have the leaves. What can I use please?
Yummy! Appreciate if you could share on how to make Bangkit Cheese. TQ
my dough turned out to be more yellow and also it's too moist. I've followed the exact same amount as  shown is the recipe.. could it be becaise of the humidity?
I love all your cooking  you great cook  love to watch you cook  any food and   Pineapples tarts beautiful  cooking healthy food thank you for sharing Bless you all.
I tried to make this kuih bangkit but after I put in only 2 tablespoon of coconut cream the dough goes limp. :( I don't know what went wrong. Any advise?
if we dont add baking powber ，is  that a matter
Where do u get the pandan leave  when u are in Europe? I am in Europe. I can't find pandan leave/pandan essence.
what the defferent if i didnt put the baking soda? cos some of the receipt without  baking soda
hi could u pls advise me why the surface of  my kueh bangkit turns light brown but the bottom is not cook.. and it is crispy in the outer and hard inside
Good morning!  Thanks!😊
Hi,  your recipe stated that bake the tapioca flour for 4 hours but your video said that 1 1/2 hour. kindly advice.   Thanks!
hi dear .... can you please lemme know if these cookies can be made eggless? Or if any substitute for egg.... I am a vegetarian and would wanna make without egg. have you ever tried them eggless?
i have tried it and your recipe is simply superb👌
New year's coming soon and I'll be making this soon! I'm practicing mooncakes now for mid-autumn festival!
Do i have to bake to flour with pandan? Can i use it raw?
Hi! May I know if you need to be fast when molding the dough into the various shapes? Because I am worried that there might be problems with the dough drying out (if I take my own sweet time!) before they are baked resulting in a failed cookie. Thanks!
The crunchy noise! omg!
Ngon
May I ask where we can buy these cookie molds online?  Thanks!!
Hi just a question... Can I use the coconut powder mixed with water instead of the store-bought coconut cream? would these cookies turn out the same?
waaaa~~~ I love kuih bangkit..

Lovely video. Your instructions are so clear and easy to follow.
Does chocolate mold work instead?
May I ask you a question? Are you perhaps from or in Germany? My mom and me, we really like to watch your videos because we are from Malaysia ourselves (^o^)
