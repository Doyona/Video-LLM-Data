Thanks for watching!  Do you have a favorite kitchen appliance?
💩🫵🏼
why in the world did you do it upside down
Just got my Ninja pressure cooker for this Christmas!  I literally can't wait to try this! Thank you so much for sharing! 💖
love chicken skin...
Ok I'm going to try this today!!
Love chicken skin
Team crispy chicken skin!
Just ordered one of these cookers a few weeks ago. It arrived, I just have to pick it up. I'm very anxious to try it.  Glad that you did the whole chicken, that looks really easy. And yes, gotta have that chicken skin!  Thanks for a great review!
I love the skin you're in...team skin!
*OMG! This review is overdue..... I FREAKING love my Ninja. **do7.pl/Ninja** My friend convinced me and another friend to get Ninjas and boy am I so glad that I did. I cook for 2 in my household and I get very annoyed using a full oven or even dealing with the stove. In the last month, I have made 90% of my meals using the Ninja Foodi. It's efficient, easy to clean, easy to keep my kitchen clean, convenient, and makes all my food yummier.Some of the things I love to make ..... Yummy weekend brunch, CHICKEN WINGS YUM, the french fries are perfectly crispy and soo much more .... this past weekend I even made homemade pop tarts. What a universal machine. I highly recommend this to anyone looking to ease their kitchen life and inspire themselves to be more creative with this nifty kitchen appliance.*
I have one also and love it! Yes skin please. Gives it flavor. 😉
Looks so so easy , my friends just got one and they love it , thanks for the nice demo
I wish you had checked the temperature
I've been through three lids so far . I got my third one set out and arrived yesterday.  Is there any reason why the pressure releases on its own when it counts down ? What am I doing wrong ? Plus my unit is my second new unit .
Burnt pieces are toxic to human cells, enjoy...
I just got this monster 😂 for Christmas. Trying to learn all about it. I have a chicken that’s really big, about a 10 lb. I’m wondering if I can cook it in the pot, rather than in the cook & crisp basket, I think I’ll have more room. Then remove the pressure cook lid & use the crisping top. Would that work? Is there really any need to use that basket? If it doesn’t fit, can I cut it up & do the same thing? Hope to get some help here. I’m a little afraid of this thing!! 😅
i subscribed you're welcome.
The drag of those teeth on that fork though 😵😵😵
I have an Instant Pot, do you think i need to keep it if i get a Ninja?
Dude! You’re yelling at us! Smh!
Can anyone tell me if this is safe to use around pets.
Yes to chicken skin! I made a whole chicken this week, I put it in my air fryer oven, then in my pressure cooker. Yes, it was delicious, but maybe I need to pressure cook first then air fry? I'll try it your way this week! (And I agree, who doesn't love to cook for their family? Many of my friends go out to eat every single night, so unhealthy! ) Enjoyed your video!
Thanks for sharing this video.
came here to see if this thing us worth uying.....but this woman's voice annoys the heck out of me......
TEAM CHICKEN SKIN!!!😂
Why did you cook the chicken upside down in the pot?
I like chicken skin too! (Skin team) btw your teeth are so white!
Can't believe they also sell in SYDNEY! Yeah!
We just bought the Foodi today. Thank you for your review and demo. It was so helpful. I'm excited to use it and try great healthy quick recipes
nothing better then instant pot
That chicken is not cooked. It should be tan not white
Wonderful and thanks for sharing this.
I know you have to make sure it cooks good. I had to pressure cook mine 25 instead of 22 to get it cooked inside really good.
Love it!!
I just got one yesterday. Looking forward to using it.
Thanks for sharing! I just received my Foodi & am looking forward to seeing all the yumminess I can make. No skin, sorry.
Does it crisp both sides?
Jess, good job, we love the Ninja Foodi pressure cooker, it's a excellent product, Oh, I hate chicken skin, and my wife loves it, the only food that she doesn't like is tripe, and I don't blame her it's disgusting! lol
Great review. Something that’s really been getting in my crawl is when all the Ninja head keep saying their not paid or endorsed by Ninja and then for like the gazilenth time someone; you said.... YOUR Not sponsored or paid by Ninja. I get that for legal purposes but, is a far cry when they send you one of Free. Not too many people get paid $1000 an hour. Just saying. Happy cooking 😁 Ohhh Yeah! Team Chicken Skin!😍
Team chicken skin
You are correct the skin is the best but be careful in to days world like they lied to us about skin and wholesome fats, they have also sold us sick birds Hope you had a chance to watch Food Inc on Prime.
Wow thank you so much I'm using my ninja foodie  and  love your tips it helped out a lot love my chicken
looks yummy! Great video and review.. I love the skin too!
Love the Skin myself.
No chicken skin🙄🙄🙄🙄
I’m on team skin but I know people take it off because it is supposed to be bad for you but I believe it’s the best part of it loved your video thank you
I was wondering why your chicken is upside down. Did someone teach you to cook it that way, for a reason? Juicier breast meat? Just wondering. The color was great. Was it cooked all the way through?
I think she likes hearing her own voice, like fingernails on a blackboard.
I love it! I’d feel crazy buying one of those because I have an Instant Pot Ultra and an air fryer so 🤷🏾‍♀️. But it looks super cool 🤩
Way too CHATTY !!!  Wasted too much time talking about how much she LOVED THE APPLIANCE & later how much she LOVED THE TENDER CRISPING  feature.  Would have been better use of time going over the FUNCTIONS of the different settings,  then how you set it up, how/ when you checked on the chicken,  how you got it out of the pot,  then actually CUTTING INTO THE CHICKEN.  Really didn't need to see you CHEWING IT & saying HMMMMMMM .....
when doing veg or pot, must they be in single layer or just tossed in?
I'm team right side up chicken.
Me too and Unfortunately I want one of these now too. I am just crazy I guess 😊👋
Yeah!! Received my new Foodi for my birthday this weekend!! I LOVE IT!!! I'm such a kitchen gadget junkie too!! I really have a problem getting rid of the older stuff that the new stuff is supposed to be replacing!! :)
I had an 6 1/2 lbs turkey and didn’t use the basket. It turn out great. And also use the juice for the gravy, right inside the same pot.
Did you pour off the liquid before starting the air frying?
Sams club is so close, I get a rotisserie chicken when I feel like chicken. Like the info anyway.
Thank you for this video. Why don’t you season the chicken before you cook it?
Your chicken is upside down. It should be facing up. When using a regular air fryer you start upside down then flip and cook the other side. The Ninja Foodi you put breast side up and never flip.
Skin's good
Chicken skin all the way !!
Great video I'm definitely team chicken skin that's where all the flavors are
