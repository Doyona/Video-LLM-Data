So good. I used half the can of the milk and it's still very sweet. And so so good.  Hubby asked me to add choc chips and I threw in a few macademia nuts that we were given... Oh my. While making coffee I added some to the other half of the milk and we'll have choc-coffee flavored ice cream next time, woohoo!  Thanks for introducing these simple recipes to us, sweetoholics!
Hay David yummy ice cream this one of yours I watch a lot I have an ice cream machine can I put the ingredients into the ice cream machine if so do I mix it or let the machine do the work as have not had the machine long thanks

Thanks for this Chef...............your recipes are excellent xx Jean from Scotland.
I recently subscribed to your channel for two reasons:  the easy-peasy recipes, plus your delightful Aussie accent!   We Americans do enjoy hearing y'all talk.
We love you all the way from the US thank you for your simple recipes for some delicious food God bless
Amazing simple recipe
I love seeing a fellow foodie do the eye roll 🙄 when eating something delicious 😋
OMG I love you so much. Take care.
You have amazing eyes!!
Now made the coffee version and a plain version that I added vanilla essence and finely chopped, frozen cherries. Soooo good!!! So happy to have a “healthier” option than store bought. Thank you!
Lovely
If you cant find vanilla beans what can i substitute it with?
I want an ice cream like the old fashioned Breyer's.  Not the current recipe.
It is very good leaves a weird fatty layer in my mouth but that may be my fault other then that it is absolutely delicious
oh this will be a must.. hi, new friend/subscriber. found you over at " RidgeLife". come on over when you've time. :-) .
I had watched it when I was in school! Feeling nostalgic!😍
Great things you cook thank you godbless you always carl in london
Someday I’m gonna make that and make a root beer float with it.
Is this good for diabetics?
Oh how gorgeous,  can’t wait to make this one. All your recipes are simply delicious. You are my favourite chef. MERRY XMAS TO YOU. Greetings  from Melbourne 😋👍
Yummy my grandson said it tasted better than a hug!!!  How is that for a good review.  Layered it a  ribbon of really good caramel/butterscotch sauce, Presidents Choice in Canada! My husband loved it.  Thankyou for making these video, amazing!!
Why do donuts mark down? He’s a great chef who makes it simple
Thank you for this recipe! Saved my bacon today!
It finally became summer in Germany and YouTube suggests your ice cream 😍  I hope you're doing great! Warm regards from wonderful Algovia
Fat
I cannot fond vanilla bean what substitute do you recommend thank you
Whipped it up, couldn't fir it all in the container, so, sadly I had to eat some unfrozen - delish - while I'm waiting for the freezer I'm dreaming of all the flavours I can create. Thank you so much.
This ice cream is creamy and delicious!  We enjoyed it with friends on a hot summer night in Canada. Everyone loved it!  They said it was better (and creamier) than one of the most popular commercial brands:)  I added 2 tsps of pure vanilla extract (didn't have vanilla beans). I also drizzled Canadian maple syrup on top. Yum, delicious!  Thanks for this easy recipe!  Our friends in Malaysia are going to make it too!
Can I use milk instead of cream and vanilla extract instead of the bean
YOOOO WHY THIS DUDE LOOK LIKE A BLUE EYED TOMATO?
I know the purpose is no churn, but how do you think this ice cream base would do in an ice cream maker? Would it still have a great consistency?
Oh my gosh that looks good
Tasted like frozen whipped cream, couldn't finish it. ☹️
Working on an adaptation of your recipe to make olive oil & rosemary gelato. To infuse rosemary flavor, making a sort of condensed milk component out of milk, sugar, butter & vanilla, with some fresh rosemary, heated enough to get the rosemary flavor into it then removed. Cutting back a little on the heavy cream to add in some EVOO. Will let you know how it turns out! Any helpful hints out there? Thanks : )
What about vanilla bean paste?
Your eyes are beautiful
Just one question. When I tried this recipe, I find that my ice cream melts into a puddle really quickly. It literally starts melting the moment I scoop it out. Any idea what went wrong?
Soooooooooooo easy and sooooooooo much better than store bought
great
Will normal whipping cream do because I don't have heavy whipping cream where I come from
:)

WHERE DO YOU EXPECT KIDS TO TET VANILLA BEANS
I did this using his chocolate recipe and it was beyond amazing. creamy, smooth, perfection!!
Can i put the mixture in a blender instead of using a whisker?
dairy free ice cream
I put some of this ice cream in one of  those popsicle makers.  So easy to open the frig and grab an ice cream popsicle !!!
You nailed this one.  I made it last evening and had some this morning.  OMG      Its awesome.  Smooth, creamy, and full flavored.  Onepotchef = ace 😜😜😜😜😜
I enjoy your videos, I love the way you make it simple and easy.. Thanks OnePotChef. I will have to try this because I scream for ice cream...

Thanks for the video...  How do you add fruit to this recipe?/
Can you use vanilla flavor imitation
Can I use store bought whipped cream? You know the one that you spray from the bottle?
Vanila bean *
Can we use vanila essense instead of vanila dean becouse we dont have vanila beans ceif
Vanilla Bean/sea salt or dark chocolate/sea salt
it actually worksd
Hi, Chef! I made this today. When  I whipped the cream though, it started curdling. It still tastes good but didn't look as creamy like here. It looks like ricotta. Lol. But I wonder what I did wrong. I was thinking it was the hot weather. Still thanks for this. :))
wow tnq for video love it
wow tnq for video love it
I love this  guy  😊 😊 😊 😊 😊

I know it isn't necessary, but I have an icecream maker at home. Can I still use it with this recipe?
You are so nice and you also cook really like a pro. Just wondering... Can I use whipped cream instead of whipping cream?
All I got was just all wet
Just discovered your channel, great content. It's a cooking channel for MEN lol, super simple & easy.

Can I use whipping cream instead of heavy cream?
Looks delish! Thank you!
One of my friends made pumpkin ice cream and it was so good I'm not a huge fan of pumpkin but wow it was good
can you eat the ice cream
I just whipped this up and threw it in the fridge..I used half a can of condensed milk and it was perfectly sweet. Can't wait to try the final product! I tasted a small amount on the spoon and it was so yummy. I couldn't find vanilla bean at my grocery store and settled for vanilla extract...will try with fresh vanilla bean next time! Thank you so much for this simple recipe. I think I will make this for Thanksgiving to go with my Pandan Waffle recipe. :)
can you use milk insted of whipping cream
You really made it very easy 😉👌
where would I be able to purchase a vanilla pod from
can u use vanilla extract
Wow!  Just found your videos and they are amazing!  Been looking for an easy ice cream recipe for a while so this one looks perfect. Thanks 😊
Trying this today you are amazing
It would be good without being frozen i assume!
Has anyone tried it? I did but it didn't work whyyyyyyyyyyy 😩😭
Made this mixed with strawberries, raspberries, and blackberries. Sooooo goooooood!!!!
great recipe..... and thank u for the tip that we can use less condensed milk. That is what i was looking for. Gonna make it asap!!!
what are the  measurement in  cups and tps please
Amazing recipe! Can i add in some fresh blueberries into the ice cream batter? Will this take the air out of the batter?  Do you recommend 400grams or just 200 grams of sweetened condensed milk? I don't like the ice cream too sweet. ( you used 200grams in the coffee ice cream recipe you have )Thank you again. Cheers! Your fan from sunny singapore! J
This is amazingly good! Thank you so much for this fantastic ice cream recipe! ♥ :D
Would absolutely love if you could come up with a recipe for pistachio ice cream using your base of sweetened condensed milk and whipping cream. I don't want any discernible pieces of nut (not supposed to eat nuts, as you may understand based upon your past surgery) - they would need to be finely ground. That brings to mind another flavor... maple walnut ice cream (again with nut being ground up). Thanking you in advance. Absolutely love your channel.
one pot chef - which ice cream scooper did you used in the last of the video to scoop the vanilla bean ice cream?
Is it ok without vanilla bean or vanilla essence
Also tried your coffee ice ceeam it was a hit.... so i tried other making using other flavors such as cookiws n cream and mango n cheese... they were all a hit. Thanks!
Do you think this could be churned in an electric ice cream freezer?
OMG! My grandchildren will enjoy doing this. Homemade ice cream, yay!   ☺
i love vanilla ice cream but can you make a video of cookies and cream ice cream its my favorite:)
can you make vegetable icecream ?? i was thinking if it is possible. im also looking forward to make it as my product in my feasibility studies in school.. hope you can help me:) thanks a lot !!!
Yaaaaas! I love you, new subbie, keep 'em coming.
Can someone explain what "sweetened condensed milk" is? I've never heard of that before, is there anything you can replace it with? Like, could you use normal milk and just add sugar?
Can you use regular milk? Or do you have to use that kind?
Can't get it to your consistency
Made this tonight,  currently in the freezer! I doubled the recipe 😉 once it slightly sets I'm going to make ice cream sandwiches out of half of it and then finish letting it set!
Thanks a lot for sharing this recipe. I tried it and it turned out so delicious! Super duper love it!!
You just made my life. I was actually looking for a video using exactly those ingredients... thanks for the tips.
this video is actually the very first one i have seen, and i'm already hooked! ty for  making a "boring" chore, so much more interesting,, :)
I made this last week and it worked brilliantly.  It actually is the best ice cream I've ever tasted!  I'd like to try a lemon version but not sure about using lemon juice as I'm worried about it crystalising in the freezer.
Thx for the great vid, I was going to buy an ice cream maker before seeing ur vid, btw base on your recipe I added some custard (1/3 amount of the cream) to whip along, it turns out great!!!
I think this recipe is awesome. I tried it using it with Nestle La Lechera Dulce de Leche - Caramel Cajeta instead of the Sweetened Condensed Milk and added a touch of cinnamon to it. It was great by itself or on top of some apple pie. I just love the One Pot Chef.. :D My family is going to love this.. :D
With your left over vanilla beans ,..get some cheap cheap Vodka,pour some vodka in a dark bottle or jar,..I use my dark green clean empty olive oil bottles,then put your vanilla beans in the vodka I usally slice mine down the middle or chop into 1-2 in pices,..I put from 3-5 v.beans in the bottles,put in dark place for 6 weeks,..I haven't bought vanilla in over 3 yrs..and home made is SO much better,..love love your recipes..:)
Shut up yall are just hating on the one pot chef i love one pot chef hatters need to shut the hell up bitch
I wish u were my friend.
Gonna try this. But what do you do with the vanilla sugar? I love your vids. Thanks
Please give me a "print recipe" button.  Can I make this in my Vita Mix?
wow...really simple and amazing.thnnx for sharing
Hi! I'm wondering, for chocolate, is there anything to make it more "chocolatey"? I feel like cocoa powder isn't strong enough for me. I'm a chocololic.
that ice cream taste very good!!!!
You are amazing!!!  I'm gonna try a lot of your recipes :) greetings from Peru :)
I make this aaaaaaall the time. Tastes amazing and you can put whatever you want in it. My favourite so far is chocolate covered macadamias or hazelnuts in honey icecream with salted caramel sauce. Jesus it's good.
OMG I'm sooo happy I found you xx :)) love your recipes
Amazing!!! I always wanted to make my own icecream.thank you for this brilliant recipe..,Im gonna make one and share it with my neighbors.
That looks like yogurt, not heavy whipping cream.
I was wondering did you use regular heavy whipping cream? Because yours looks thicker than the heavy whipping cream I'm using thanks :)
Thanks for this recipe !
So wish I was eating this right now...thanks for sharing, happy I found this channel.
I just made this ice cream. I didn't have any vanilla beans so I used unsweetened coco powder. Chocolate ice cream is my fav anyway. I just put it in the freezer. It's late right now so I'm going to keep it in all night. I also made your Pineapple Upside Down cake and it turned out great. Thank you so much for the videos you make. They are a lot of fun to watch and even better to make. Keep up the good work because you have a lifetime follower here.
Your from Sydney? Me too
Awesome! Homemade icecream! We know what we actually put in it! Thanks!
thank you, i really love your videos, and your accent! aside from your easy way to cook and prepare things.
*drooling*  Always looking forward to seeing what you're cooking next.  Now, where's the ingredients?  :P
i couldn't stop staring at your eyes X3 <3
YOU DID IT AGAIN! Fantastic ice cream recipe!
Hello. Im just wondering if i need to add vanila esen too in my oreo ice cream? Btw, im from Malaysia n i do enjoy watching ur video. Have a nice day!
Hi, I'm planning to use your basic recipe to make mango ice cream. What sort of fruit:ice cream base ratio would you recommend? I'm thinking one mango would be too much due to the water content. Don't want my ice cream to turn out with big crystals
Why are you so amazing? Your recipes are so simple and require not too much effort, which is great for college students like me.
You are so precious!! :)
No eggs needed??
You are so amazing me and my mum are obsessed with your videos and have been trying out your recipes you make it so easy to understand and do yourself :) keep up the amazing work
no one knows how many times i have watched this video and asked my mom to go to the store!!!
We don't have sweetened condensed milk here, how could i sweeten simple condensed milk?
Hi One Pot Chef do you know why or want to know why the other ice cream video went viral?
I'm so doing this! David, my lovely wife's favorite ice cream is pistachio. Would you recommend I make a pistachio paste to flavor the ice cream?
Can I request a video? an ice cream using honey as an ingredient.  Thanks,
looks good!!
Amazing!
Gosh your channel is AWESOME you make great recipes and posting videos daily with an advice of what can we change when we are using that recipe you should have more than a million subscribers i would be happy to see that this channel is one of those i bet one day soon it will happen :-)
Love that you don't need an ice cream machine!!!
yummm
Excellent, can't wait to try this.
Ok, tried and tested and bam! All gone. I have made a few different recipes for homemade ice cream, but this one tops the lot and so so easy! My Son said it was better than the gourmet ice cream bought from the supermarket. Tomorrow I am trying chocolate. Thanks again David :)
looks great.
Oh, yum!  God bless you, young man.
OMG you're a genius!!  Thank you David. Can't wait to try this for my ice cream loving son.  :)
This looks lovely David!
great video ! I'm curious, what do you use to edit ?
So good!
Now how simple was that & so delicious! Thanks for the flavor tips David . Im thinking choc berry :)
P.S. I have found there are a lot of rude and uneducated people on you tube, If you haven't got anything nice to say...don't say anything at all!!!!
Hi David....I would love to make licorice ice-cream.... how do I go about that!!!you can't buy it anymore!!!!
I would combine my two favorite flavors by making a vanilla bean strawberry ice cream. :D I wouldn't use only pureed strawberries though. Gotta have it a little chunky ;)  - Heidi
Ice cream smiley face at 2:46
:)
Delicious. I make it the same way
Oh no... could not get past the whipping into soft peaks part as it mysteriously disappears.Must start over again
can't remember when i subscribed to this channel, but now in really glad i did!
Looks so Scrummy! This will go down a treat in the summer, thanks David for sharing :)
Yes!
Your coffee icecream video had an article in DENMARK!
Simple Cooking Channel did this too! Yum!
LOL be careful the internet trolls don't understand the definition of an ice cream. They think it has to have specific ingredients. LOL nice job Todd
Aaand this is why I don't have a freezer... I would be so much fatter than today  ....
Well done. This looks awesome. No need to buy an ice cream maker. Thanks for all your recipes....one of the best and original channels..xo
Add peanut butter and chocolate chips! Delicious!
I never knew it was so easy! Looks so yummy!
Great recipe! I do have one question, if I want to make green tea ice cream, do  I just use the same heavy whipping cream, and sweet condensed milk but change the vanilla bean to matcha green tea powder? Just want to make sure that the two base ingredients are the heavy whipping cream and sweet condensed milk. :)
I sure wish we could get cream that rich and thick here in the US!
This is must have! Thank you so much!
I used HEAVY WHIPPING CREAM but does not comes out like the video. Why is that, can someone let me know, please? Thanks
That looks delicious! Thanks for the vid!
Wow that looked extremely creamy.  I have just received my package of vanilla pods last week. So I am off to buy the other 2 ingredients to make this luscious dessert. Another tip David for the pods is once scraped, place the pods in an air tight jar cover it with water and let it sit in the cupboard.  In time you will have lovely vanilla extract. Just keep adding the pods as you use them. They are too expensive to waste. Have a nice day David :)
I was thinking it could be nice made into a cheesecake icecream, would it still freeze to the right consistency if I put in cream cheese too? Hubby would LOVE that :)
This is unbelievably perfect! Thanks!
Mmmm I cannot wait to try this!
I wish i could eat ice cream D: my teeth are too sensitive for that
Thanks for such a simple,creamy and lovely recipe :-) Love from India Sindhu
That looks awesome , love your channel. Can you do some more casserole recipes please .
Great recipe David, must try it sometime!!!
First one to see yaii!!!
