Hi Elise, I hope you respond to this. So I need to make 100 cupcakes for an event. I recently took a Wilton cupcake decorating class and have been using their frosting recipe but was never completely satisfied with it, so when I saw yours, I thought I'd try it. I haven't piped it yet, but the consistency of the frosting looks weird to me. Because I have to decorate so many, I quadrupled the recipe I have which is basically 1 pound of powdered sugar to 1 cup of butter. So I beat 4 cups of butter first for over 5 min like you said. I left the butter out overnight so it was at room temp but I don't know if it was too too soft. After beating the butter I added 4 pounds of powdered sugar. I thought the mixture would start to get hard and need some liquid but it never seemed to get hard enough. It seemed like the soft soft butter kept the mixture from hardening up. I added 4 teaspoons of vanilla anyway. After that it seemed like a good consistency but I was so afraid that I hadn't added any milk or water. So I added a Tablespoon of water (Wilton says you can use milk or water, and water doesn't spoil as quickly as milk.) after adding the water, it got more liquidly. But my fear is that four pounds of powdered sugar should require more liquid. anyway, so now it looks a but weird to me. I tried your spoon  test and it seemed to fall off too easily. So then I added more powdered sugar, but believe me, I'm scared it's too sugary now. I also added meringue powder which Wilton has in their recipe. In my Wilton class, my instructor never said that the butter has to be beaten that long (5 min.) and also to use the flat beater attachment, not the whisk. Can you give me any advice on how to salvage this butter cream. I don't want all that butter and powdered sugar to go to waste. Thanks a bunch! And thanks for all your videos, they're great!
sweet, thanks
Wow.  Love the yellow and pink ruffle ones best!
i love your shos

very talented...
What size petal tip are you using?
My opinion: Star piping tip: make you feel like you just create a wonderful cupcakes. Round piping tip: make your cupcakes look simple but pretty. Petal piping tip: make your cupcakes look elegant.
I love  💖💞💞the whey you design your cake and cupcake. 👌👌☺☺😁😁 💖💖💖💝💜💟💜💕👏👏
So cute I LOVE 😘
Omg that is amazing!! My eyes are burning because I didn't blink once!!
For some reason the red one looks like deli meat to me lol
You're good but you talk to much or you could carry on while you talk sorry about the criticism.
Good work
I think I cried a little. It's beautiful! Ah, so many talented people!
The fifth one reminds me of some of the kinds of meat that you would buy. I love it!!! I tried this one and got so many compliments.I told them that you had a video of it and some of them even subscribed to you. I love your videos so much.
i tried your pipping tips and they worked wonderfully and when i severed them i noticed people would take some frosting off so i tried one and i realized the frosting was super super sweet (i used your amazing buttercream recipe) what could i do to make little less sweet with out messing up the recipe?
she said the flick of that wrist
I just found you and absolutely love you! I don't like frosting so I would never make them, too time consuming but I love looking at yours for inspiration..maybe some day.

Dear Friends, I am not sure how much you know about my past. I am a breast cancer survivor. I have been cancer free for three years until yesterday when I was saddened to know that it has returned to my liver this time. So not knowing the battle I have ahead of me because there are more tests to be done to see just how far it has spread. I am sad to say that until I get more details about how we are going to take care of this I have put my cake business on hold. I hope with all that I am to be back as soon as I can. I have contacted my clients for the next two weeks to let them know that I am unable to do their orders and once I hear how we are going to deal with this will depend if I will cancel other cake orders. I will not be offended if you want to cancel your order. Thank you for your understanding in this matter. I will post further updates as I learn about my prognosis. Sincerely, Carollynn-Carollynn's cakes YouTube please watch her videos she needs your support at this sad time thank you
I think some of these are kind of redundant but it is pretty hard to come up with 6 whole different techniques so i don't blame elise... i really like the vintage ruffle and the flower one though
OMG ELESE YOU WERE ON CNN STUDENT NEWS!!
It looks like pile up ham
I thought the  clam  shell was a Christmas tree
My best friend does ballet and the ballerina tutu reminded me of her. It's almost her birthday and I think I'm gonna go out and buy a petal tip for this!
Now I want cake ....

This is the second time I have commented but I think you should do a cupcake in a jar.So all you have to do its add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients after someone has got it as a gift!
What's happening with cupcake chadoku? (Can't spell)
Hello!! You probably won't get this but I was wondering how do you get your cupcakes to be so flat when you bake them? Mine end up all lop-sided and it makes it difficult to ice!! Please help me!! BTW I'm a Goldcoast Aussie!!!! LOVE YOU!!!
Please do a kids party video. My younger brother has his birthday next week
I really love these & you make them look really easy to do. Though I do love the vintage ruffles, I would choose another color, cause it looks like a pile of ham on a cupcake. Ha ha!

You should do something inside out!
seriously you remind me of an Austrailian Rebecca Mader I dont know why but you do
Does anyone know where to get piping bags like these? I've been using ziplocks (and they have a tendency to split like you wouldn't believe...)
Can u make a wading cake Plzzz or a cake that is three or more layers and with real cake
I saw you on cnn news yesterday at school. I screamed, and my teacher asked if we had any questions. I said that I was subscribed and for the rest of the period we watched your videos.
You did make the vintage ruffled petals look like lunch meat. Lol you could make some mean desserts that look like sandwiches but are actually cupcakes 😧
iam aleeza your channel is verygood
The first one kind of looks like a Christmas tree! That would be great at a Christmas party!
you should make a cake that looks like you
Wow they are all so pretty. You always make it look so easy. Great job.
you should do fall out boy cupcakes
the pink one looks like ham
I love your vids ! And they always make me hungry for sweets!
am I the only one who thinks tahs 2:11 is a lil racist? but alice,i love you
Love!
To keep the sprinkles in one place with out them going on icing where they're not needed you could use a funnel/a makeshift one to have control of where they go :)
subtitles in spanish please!!!
do you have a recipe for those cupcakes? They look real good 😍
Look at the flicka da wrist.
8:38 looks like meat lol, but it looks cool

I saw you in CNN student news
7:17 look at the flick of da wrist
Can you make a video on how to be a cleaner cook because I am soooooo messy!!!
For the two toned flowers, I wonder if it would work to mix clear piping gel with luster dust and paint that down the side of the bag instead of gel color... So that the edge of the flowers would be sparkly?
do a giant mince pie with a Santa face at the top
