But this is pain au chocolat
Just say pain au Chocolat and move on...😅
5 years later and I still love her personality!!!!!
STilll hereer
Crazy how time flies so fast, i watched this a lot 2019-2020. Covid and staying home, no job and all i dream is to meet Alix because i just love the enthusiasm. Even followed Alix and Rie on Instagram because I wanna get updates for the recipes they might share. Now I'm in my rent bedroom, watching this again because I'm sad. Alix's behind tasty video makes me feel lighter because I wanna make a croissant.
I will forever love Alix
She is gorgeous
Missing Alex!!
Girl you deserved that victory walk at the end gurl 🎉 Love your energy, persistence, fun spirit and hope you had a nice trip at the end there 😂
Why do the anglo Americans always get everything wrong with naming our pastries? A croissant is a croissant it has the shape of a crescent moon. A pain au chocolat is a pain au chocolate its a square pastry filled with chocolate. There is no such thing as a CHOCOLATE CROISSANT ! Come on!
3:25 and 4:58 hahaha whoever add this ti edit is genius. But I hope the other lady's was also included.
I LOVE this girl! If she isnʼt the definition of adorable, then NOTHING is😂😂😂
How much Yeast we have to use in the recipe???
This vid makes me happy
I think she is laughing on viewers who knows everything and appreciate her.😂 what is next
She is so beautiful I want to poke her. She got so precious smiles
Who came after her video 😂😂😂
wow, they look so good. almost as good as store bought ones 👀😂
Who came from alex' TikTok 🤣🤣🤣 these were trader joes
Lol I am here from Alix’s tik tok about this vid 😂❤
These were trader joe's croissants at the end😭 OMG my life has been a lie.
In the Netherlands we call those chocolate broodjes
I'm pretty sure those are pan aux chocolat not chocolate croissants but you know screw the French
My biggest flex is that I was able to make decent croissants thanks to the tasty recipe. Thank you Alix for suffering for me to be successful <3
It's ✨️Pain au chocolat✨️
Good job for trying 🎉🎉
Aaand the Oscar goeoeoes to Alix !!! 🥇🥇🥇🥇🥇🥇🥇🥇🥇🥇🥇🥇🥇
Too much noise and less work
Alex its pain aux chocolat
I LIVE for shady rei😭😂
Is it just me or does Alix look like she’s pregnant?
Toomany of extra mives brrrrrrrr
there pan au chcolat, not chocloate croissants
Correction:  The thing you made is not called ‘Chocolate croissant’ it is called ‘Pain au chocolat’ or ‘chocolatine’ (depends on what part of France you are from)  A chocolate croissant, or ‘Croissant de chocolate’ is a crescent shaped flaky bread with a layer of chocolate in the middle or on top, way different from this.  And this is a ‘pain au chocolate’ which is a puff pastry roll with 1 - 2 pieces of chocolate inside.
The thumbnail is SUS
So I made brioche pan au chocolat from a book and wasn’t satisfied. I went to YouTube to find a better recipe and find out that pan au chocolat is a difficult recipe. Great.
the butter doesnt produce co2, the water in the butter produces steam, THAT is what creates the lift and layers.  the co2 thing is yeast breads.  I didn't see if you put yeast in your recipe, you typically don't. Either way your explanation was incorrect. :)
This was an emotional journey
PAIN AU CHOCOLAT
You are freaking adorable! I love watching you bake because you get as frustrated as I do but you also never give up and your final products are always amazing! I made these and your macaron recipe. Keep it up!
Ça s’appelle pas des croissants mais des pains au chocolat
That’s not a croissant tho… croissant legit means crescent… which is the moon shape… see the emojis 🥐 and 🌙…
chocolate croissant 🤨🤨
Its Pain Au Chocolat  . Its not even the shape of “croissant” . Its the same pastry family but different kind.
She’s like tessa from after but a lil chubby version❤️
fun fact: it's called pain au chocolat direct translation: chocolate bread
As a french person, I guarantee they’ll be people in this comment section saying that it’s “pain au chocolat” and not chocolate croissants
its called: "Pain au chocolat" its like if you are making a pizza and call the video: "Flatbread with tomato and cheese"??????????????
5:42 me : hopefully NOT the last day
so annoying and fake
It´ s amazing. Thank you so much!
Rie in the background be like: what is she doing
Americans call pain au chocolat ‘chocolate croissant’?! That’s so weird lmao
orrr take a croissant poke a whole add chocolate warm it BOOM
*ON DIT PAS CROISSANT AU CHOCOLAT MAIS PAIN AU CHOCOLAT!!!!!!!!!
7:19 LMAOOOO
i love these at starbucks and get them all the time, now i feel so bad for making the chefs make them so often to keep them in stock (since i buy them 24/7) 😭
Lauren Alaina look alike! 👀
5:01 😂 lesson of the day is to never give up no matter how complicated or other people say negative things about you 🔥
I miss these behind tasty episodes
The 1st attempt was going in a good direction. The problem is the lamination of butter i think. She didn't laminate a slab of butter between the initial folds.
The best croissants needs a 3 days in a making it   And you shouldn’t combine your butter with your wheat flour  You have to wait to knead them separately then when folding it that’s that time you combine butter and the dough
i love alix pls she seems so down to earth and so cute
She’s the twin of Emilia
That's a chocolatine tho 👀😭
"Creates co2...."
I love how Alix always makes something very hard and she never has it in the first try lol 😂 😂
:0 :D 💃🕺🕺💃🕺💃💃💃🕺💃🕺 :D dang you did it lol
4:34 this is one of the reasons why i dun like rie anymore. she was my fav. but these shades, sarcasm and her acting like she is the best. I don't like anyone who fakes it. I just feel she's not modest. That's all.
Manchester girl
is it because she didn't knead the dough that its breaking apart?
Now you can see how hard they work for the aesthetic shots lol
i want that shirt, so much internet to do
Love the video ❤️
Rie: How many folds did you do? Alix: I lost count Rie: Oohhh.  *Bruh the look from Rie :'>*
Alix 👌🏻 for real these are amazing!!  Rie “shade shade shade” 😂😂
You are funny 😄
Watching this after watching how Claire Saffitz did her version, and realized "wow the difference in quality and attitude in making the croissant dough is like heaven and earth lmao." You can really tell which one went to culinary school and is actually a professional baker, and which one is just an everyday baker. I love how Alix doesn't give up though. But Claire's explanations made croissant making something a home baker could really do.
rie be like casually in the background
You can tell ríe and Alex weren’t close friends in this time 😂
We in the Netherlands call it “ chocolade broodjes “ chocolate bread
This is not a croissant and croissant is a shape like the moon 🌙 🥐
I love alix sm 😂 I’d watch these videos all the time and now im literally a baker and i make croissants everyday at work and i always think about this video as i make them lol
Cute skirt Alix😊👌🏾
She looks literally stressed bt with a smile lol 😂
Wow Yei dn give up Alix 😅
Oh ries behind thr 😂
Everything ms b cold Alix... including the grater 👌🏾😅
Love u Alix long time lol 😅😊❤️👌🏾🇿🇦
Damn I miss her:(
Rie is in the frame, but are they friends here already?
5:10 Can-Can by Jacques Offenbach LOL.
Pain au chocola
J’adore cette vidéo
7:18 I can't stop replying this part
Imagine if she dropped them at the end
As a French croissant lover, I had a stroke when she said «  cinnamon roll croissants » 😂 don’t you dare !!
Just paus the video in 7:20 😳🤤
Tu viens de massacrer notre héritage culinaire
2:23 Rie in the background be like: *let's pretend we didn't see that*
Reminds me of my favourite Chocolate Croissants from Starbucks
Been their or else had rather more most worst experience wen I started self cooking so I took help of Yoga it helps me stay calm & patient so I slowly improved my cooking 😉 👏🏻
🙂
It's so annoying because they call it a croissant. This is "pain au chocolat" or "chocolatine."  It even makes it confusing because I thought she was making a croissant and then it turns out it isn't a croissant lol
Chocolate croissants?  Its actually petit pain au chocolat
I think you are making a puff pastry with chocolate in it. Pretty sure Croissant dough is yeast dough. You are funny and fun to watch though. I'm glad you liked your final product, because that is really all it's about in the end.
Not Rie judging her in the backround 😂
That's a delicious croissant ...
What a little Hottie!! I'm not even sure what she was making because I couldn't keep my eyes off her 😍
Kwah songt
please bring back this show, i really miss her in the kitchen 😩☝🏻
Rie: how many times did you fold? Alix: I lost count 🤣 Rie: 💀🥴
For some reason sometimes when i watch Tasty, I get Old Navy Ads
Nobody: Rie: 👁👄👁
terrible video, lots of jokes and cuts... I need the actual recipe
Its called a pain au chocolat for goodness sakes
“I think I’m gonna her a mental breakdown”  Me to hun me too😂
So i rly wanted to make croissants wcen after watching this lmao. Rn my dough is resting in a bowl. I will update later
i think that is the reason why my none of my local baker except me r making this thing
If you Believe in your heart and confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ died on the cross for our sins then Resurrected three days later by God and is our Lord and Savior you will be saved ! He who is sinless died on the cross for our sins just so we could be here. He is the King of Kings and Lord of Lords from generation to generation! Read your bible daily and Repent!! God bless you and your family!💜 (Not trying. to force upon anyone who doesn’t agree
What are the other people in the bag round cooking ?
Watched this and I’m so discouraged
Oh I love her recipes so much 🤣❤️💐
That’s a Pain Au Chocolat…
Bruh I freaking made croissants for 3 times and all failed. Macarons too :'(
here's how to make chocolate croissants EASY   1. Go buy some croissants  2. Cut them open like a sandwich  3. Add Nutella  4. Close it and eat it
Ok she is literally the older jojo siwa and u cannot convince me otherwise.
There's hydrogen and helium. Lithium, beryllium, boron, carbon everywhere, nitrogen all through the air
2:22 A focused Rie in the background
I really enjoyed the grand entrance with sunglasses tho. Hahahaha
I love how Rie is chill and watching in the background
You look Like one girl name jojo
Alix works hard, but the croissant devil works harder.
I like chocolate croissant
Eso es una napolitana
Salam 👍👍👍👍👍❤❤❤❤❤💋💋
i was like bro i saw the short video of just her hands making it i was like nah i ain't making nothing then seeing bts the struggle i feel sorry for those bakers and her when she said it look like a dress just before she said that i was like it look like the thing you put your dress on and it has an hourglass body took the words right out my mouth   when she came out with the shades i was like yess babyy lol
When I made croissants in school it’s not that hard but at the same time just rigorous and it’s funny how she had the wrong idea the whole time until Claire was like oh baby no it’s a 2 day process I love Alex
Am I the only one confused how no one  realised those aren't croissants? And the channel is based around baking/cooking???
Didn’t love the dieting comments but k
Half my life  I grew up in a bakery eating cakes and other goodies boy oh boy was I chubby
Alix is like the perfect mix of adult ish..nis and child ish ..nis
it needs to rise!
So we should never forget one thing for the things we love to do. And it is called fun
Did anyone notice Rie in the back? 2:23
bro alex just reminds of the beach idk
*"9 Days of baking and... I mixed up the salt & the sugar."*
Anyone else going to acknowledge that they’re pain au chocolat not just chocolate croissants
This was painful to watch 😬 it's Pain au Chocolat 🥐🍫
that is not a croissant. Its a pain au chocolat or chocolatine like some weird people call it
I love how all of them are clapping for alix lol😂
Me : Is that Rie in the back? 😂
it's the dramatic music and walk for me but her just being honest nd struggling so cute nd the others that said i made it once nd never again😂❤
one of my favorite episodes
this is actually better than tha real video itself lol
Alix  you are an amazing baker

Ulkka m10
🙏
All of France is proud.
This is, again, so inspirational. Thanks much
These aren't "Chocolate Croissants". These are called Pain au chocolat. Named after the origin country of France.
Rie in the background just watching Alix struggle like 😐
I like the way Rie was in the corner minding hr own business
The intelligent spleen concomitantly rush because medicine phylogenitically divide onto a cautious appendix. deep, utopian underwear
My cousin makes these ALL the time from scratch, they so good
Tyu7u7u7u7u7u7778uuu7u7u7u7u7u7u7u7777777u7u7u7u7u7u7u7u7u7u7u7u7u7u7u7u7u7u7u7u7u7u7u7u7u7u7u[
I love how hardworking and compassionate Alix is about whatever she does, Never giving up even if it takes weeks!
Aww man I LOVE those chocolate croissants. I thought about making them too.  No Wonder they are so expensive to buy lol
alix:banging the dough rie: casually carrying a microwave
My eyes got a pain shot when I read 'chocolate croissants' 😵😐  Does anybody else call them 'Napolitanas' ?
7:19 ı have been died because of this mkgfmkgmg
Alex is just so adorable and bubbly.  I’m sick and stuck at home on bed rest so these videos are the only thing making me laugh right now.
Do americans actuallt call them "chocolate croissants" hahahaha
7:20     Hey y’all, looks who’s here *hair toss*
4:34 Bruh nice acting rei *Oh*
4:51 so *thats* how tasty gets their food ideas
definition of smiling through the pain
It's Paun Au Chocolat not chocolate croissant.......there's a difference
The needy bay neuroanatomically attract because discovery relatedly nail from a aback pocket. aromatic, melodic competitor
Tf is even crescente it's croissant
i miss alix. ❤️
😂 love your channel
It’s not chocolate croissant. It’s chocolatine.
That’s a Pain au Chocolat 🤦🏾‍♀️
THIS IS THE BEST ERA OF TASTY. THERE YOU GO NOW I SAY IT 😭❤️
How can i get a job at this!? This seems fun
PAIN. AU. CHOCOLAT.
The voracious c-clamp approximately drip because harmony undeniably radiate for a tricky lead. tedious, ambiguous canada
That’s not a croissant is called pain au chocolat croissant means Crescent that is not a crescent pain au chocolat means chocolate bread
6.57 😂❤️
"Support your local bakers" - Alix
6:25  "the layer of butter will melt and create CO2 , which puffs up the croissants" umm... what?   CO2 from the yeast... not the butter
So the moral is u cant do this dish simply without hard work!!! ❤️😂😂🔥🔥🎉🎉
Pain au chocolat = like   Chocolatine = comment
Hannah: awwww they look amazing Alix: It's butterrr lolllllllllll
That's literally me doing any kind of Doug definitely not fav thing to make
the way she tried to make them at the beginning was so off, did she even bother doing a google search?
frick off
these are called pain au chocolat
The music sounds like ASAP science the elements of the periodic table
Isn’t it called a pain au chocolat
Takeaway- support your local baker.  Hilarious!
Alix is such a cutie. Her personality alone is something to fall in love with.
everytime someone likes this video, a french person dies saying 'THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS A CHOCOLATE CROISSANT, IT'S A PAIN AU CHOCOLAT'
I understand why they call it chocolate croissant and it's gonna be awkward if they tried to pronounce 'pain au chocolat' but I still imagine a chocolate-flavored croissant when I heard of a chocolate croissant
Those aren’t croisssants they are pain au chocolat
The way she came out of the kitchen with the croissant tray and then cheers for her self, that's why I like Alix so much, well done :)
I like croissants sm, never knew that the bakers work this hard to make' em for us  Alix and Rie are my fav in tasty btw :)
U have to use water not milk
I just loveddd the part with the sunglasses 😂😂😂
Alix works hatd, but the croissant devil works harder.
alix: *struggles to roll dough*   rie: *peacefully carries microwave*🥰
what is the yeast brands you use commonly in every video
Hannah: ohhhhhh my god they look amazing Alix laughs: it's butter thats so funnnny
She's such a calm and sweet soul
I plan on baking chocolate croissants pretty soon for my insta and honestly I already know this is about to be me lol   Follow me on insta to check out my croissants 💖 @queen_dp1219
That "Ohhh Yesssss" part from Andrew makes the ending wowwwww
u have a beautiful smile !
Thats not croissants, why americans are like that?
Omg! You're so cute!!
8 days to make a croissant and she actually made pain au chocolat
Ok this is soo cook i danced to the back ground music
I love how non-French ppl could call a croissant correctly but for a "pain au chocolat", well... Why not a "chocolate croissant", then ? (it's not even in the shape of it, lol)
am i the only one just watching Alix struggle then you see rie just calmly doing stuff in the background
I Mean they waste soo many things like all the failed attempts
All of us French people here outraged because there is no such thing as a chocolate croissant 😓 pain au chocolat people !!!!
She reminds me of Florence Pugh.
I feel so bad for her(haha)
Rie just casually putting away a microwave in the background at 2:31 and 2:34 while watching Alix struggle is a mood
It's not in the shape of a crescent so it's not a croissant. There's a reason the French call it a pain au chocolat/chocolatine.
3:08
This is why I don’t trust tasty
So that's why the French call it a pain...
The humorous street potentially listen because distributor bizarrely pick into a invincible toenail. absent, sparkling pie
I died at 7:20 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 You gotta love her ❤️
The versed spring contemporaneously flash because beef originally joke against a black-and-white literature. past, comfortable paper
The repulsive break epidemiologically blot because correspondent allegedly object athwart a abaft body. pastoral, optimal check
whenever i feel down i always come back to this video for a good laugh
You are actually catching fun with lots of smiles. I love seeing you around Alix❤
IT IS CALLED A "PAIN AU CHOCOLAT" and that's mean like "chocolate bread" but A CROISSANT IS NOT THAT 😭
6:57 😂😂😂😂
Why does tasty have so much fridges in my house theirs only 1
me knowing its a pain au chocolat and that every time she said croissant it chips away a piece of my will to live
I love the ending!
pain au chocolattt
She’s the most annoying girl
she's just adorable
France: a war between poeple who call that « pain au chocolat » and « chocolatine » America: ✨cHoCOlaTe cRoiSsAnt✨
7:20, love this part 😂
Our local grocery store has really nice chocolate croissants, after watching this I really respect the chef who makes them
actually the first dough was perfect :) just needed a little bit of rest in fridge
That's just a "pain au chocolat"... Why is she like she invented something?
shes like 'ive never made chocolate croissants before' and as of this video, she still hasnt. sis those arent croissants
There is no such thing as “chocolate croissants” omg it’s either pain au chocolat or chocolatine
Seems like it's really take too much time to make it tho😭
Sorry but this is not croissant. I live in Paris and  i know very well that this is pain au chocolat (bread with chocolate)
It's not really a croissant but I know you english people call it that way
I wanna work for tasty so bad
So this is why bakeries sell croissants for the price of one leg
I don’t understand that tasty is the building behind tasty ;-; Jk I know what you mean haha
who has watched this for the 50th time now😂❤️
I love baking and this channel is my inspiration ❤🎂
French people should be triggered by them not calling it as ‘pan au chocolat’
Hey my sister and I are trying to grow our YouTube channel if anyone could subscribe to it that would be great it’s called Faith and Hailey’s channel  there is a picture of me and my sister. We are trying to get to 700 subs before the new year. And please tell your friends 😊
hahahaha I have been watching several croissants video trying to learn how to make them and then I see this one...you gave me such a good laugh! your steps are truly one of a kind but I love your enthusiasm! its good to get silly once in a while and just play!
Not croissaaaants
Love in the begging when rie is just watching her suffer
These are not croissants please. These are pain au chocolate!
95% croissant 5% chocolate
7:48 why does sound like jojo siwa
That’s a pain au chocolat or a chocolatine
Its good to think that they have to do it a lot of times rather than thinking they get it perfect
Very funny
Yes, it’s hard work for us bakers
Why am I just now seeing this and why is she so damn cute
I miss Alix :/
I am 12 and I made croissants they were so very easy!!!
I have a new found appreciation for whoever makes my pillsbury crescent roll
I love getting costcos croissants and stuffing hersheys chocolate in it and toasting it
Who else sees Rie in the background
Highlight: the stain in her pants
I love Alix
"im going to have a mental breakdown"-Alix 2018       same girl
"Many of you may be wondering why I haven't just given up, I've wondered the same thing myself, but it's my job so I can't" So relatable 😂😂
Wait, why is there two lines of chocolate when Alix only put one line.?????? Did she faked to bake croissants???
this is like my art journey
अच्छी बात है। महिलाओं को खाना बनाना आना चाहिए।
Hang on. I thought these were called pain au chocolats.
Im 10 and made choc crossonts and it came out right the first time!🤣
That smile is contagious 😍
We call this petit pain
Why am I getting triggered that they called it a croissant when it’s a pain au chocolat 😂
Their called pan u chocolat
Croissant? Jajaja this is pan au chocolat totally different.... 😂
Chocolatines but alright
Is that rie in the background?
pain au chocolat*
7:20 Me when I passed a test I didn’t study for 😂
this shows the long process of how tasty gives us good and aesthetic baking content. plz appreciate their videos and tasty ty!
Alix and Rie gives me the same.vibe..they're Always smiling. They make other people laugh.. Only goodvibes...
Asap science the modern periodic is in the background
I saw Rie at the back
I wish she had mixed the first two doughs together because one was too wet and the other was too dry.
As coming from culinary school, I can also confirm NEVER MAKING IT again 😩
Alix:THIS IS SO HARD Rie: looks over when cleaning
2020 anyone =D
i am also 12 years old and i made this without the trouble Alix had i mean the dough was hard but other than that it was okay
this is a a pain du chocolat not choclate croissants tasty
It’s literally bent from the dough  Dough: am I a joke to you?? If it weren’t for me you wouldn’t have croissants
Ok behind tasty is way better than the original lol
Alix is so competitive and you keep making giant food 😂
C’est un pain au chocolat, putain de merde.
Just see on 7:19
John
intro spot on
Beautiful Alix
I like her attitude.
This is actually somewhat easier in commercial kitchens because of dough sheeters
Alix looked absolutely gorgeous just as she used to be. However, if she is comfortable in her new body after weight-loss, that's what is important
QUACKSONS!!!!!
I like how you persisted and never gave up!
Hey, how much grams are in the packet of yeast that they use? I've done this recipe like five times now and they never proof like they proof on the video.   PD: My packet of yeast has 10 grams on it
So funny 😂
this woman herself looks like smiling white chocolate croissant 🥐
:)
Pretty baker!!! Ayee you got a beautiful face
i'm sad she is leaving tasty
it's called. a pain au chocolat,,,
2:15 There was flour on her pants🤣🤣🤣
I love you alix
the moment she the croissants out of the oven place it made me choke on my ice cream sandwich
It's pain au chocolat or chocolatine
5 minutes craft??? Is this.?
Alix : grates butter and wants to keep the dough cold  Rie : grates butter to bring it to room temperature
who else is watching this in 2020???
"I don't claim to be a good baker"- Alix, 2017
So Sweety Alix 😘😍💖💘
her quote and image fits so well lol
Chocolate Croissants 4 cups flour  ½ cup water  ½ cup milk ¼ cup sugar  2 teaspoons salt  1 packet instant yeast  3 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened 1¼ cup cold unsalted butter, cut into ½-inch thick slices  1 egg, beaten 2 bars chocolate   Preparation In a large bowl, mix the flour, water, milk, sugar, salt, yeast, and butter.  Once the dough starts to clump, turn it out onto a clean counter.  Lightly knead the dough and form it into a ball, making sure not to over-knead it. Cover the dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate for one hour.  Slice the cold butter in thirds and place it onto a sheet of parchment paper.. Place another piece of parchment on top of the butter, and beat it with a rolling pin.  Keeping the parchment paper on the butter, use a rolling pin to roll the butter into a 7-inch square, ½-inch thick. If necessary, use a knife to trim the edges and place the trimmings back on top of the butter and continue to roll into a square.  Transfer the butter layer to the refrigerator.   To roll out the dough, lightly flour the counter. Place the dough on the counter, and push the rolling pin once vertically into the dough and once horizontally to form four quadrants.  Roll out each corner and form a 10-inch square.  Place the butter layer on top of the dough and fold the sides of the dough over the butter, enclosing it completely.  Roll the dough with a rolling pin to seal the seams, making sure to lengthen the dough, rather than widening it.   Transfer the dough to a baking sheet and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 1 hour. Roll out the dough on a floured surface until it’s 8x24 inches.  Fold the top half down to the middle, and brush off any excess flour. Fold the bottom half over the top and turn the dough clockwise to the left. This completes the first turn.  Refrigerate for one hour.  Roll out the dough again two more times, completing three turns in total and refrigerating for 1 hour in between each turn. If at anytime the dough or butter begins to soften, stop and transfer back to the fridge.  After the final turn, cover the dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.  To form the croissants, cut the dough in half. Place one half in the refrigerator.  Flour the surface and roll out the dough into a long narrow strip, about 8x40 inches.  With a knife, trim the edges of the dough.  Cut the dough into 4 rectangles.  Place the chocolate on the edge of the dough and roll tightly enclosing it in the dough.  Place the croissants on a baking sheet, seam side down.  Repeat with the other half of the dough.  Brush the croissants with the beaten egg. Save the rest of the egg wash in the fridge for later. Place the croissants in a warm place to rise for 1-2 hours.  Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). Once the croissants have proofed, brush them with one more layer of egg wash.  Bake for 15 minutes or until golden brown and cooked through.  Enjoy warm!  It's on the Tasty app!
They’re called ‘pain au chocolat’s’ we’re I live
07:47 women huh 😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣😥
The secret to a good croissant is the butter the European one has less water and the American one has more water don’t worry about what anybody says be confident and I see that you are live life have fun don’t give up you’re very talented keep it up I wish I was like you probably too late for me I’m in the business to take care
She looks like Leonardo Decaprio's Little sister 😅😂
you can see rie laughing in the back
My girlfriend gave me the angriest eyes when I told her Alix is hot and cute at the same time 😍
Alix: The butter between the layers will melt, creating CO2 and the croissants will puff up! Me: IS THE BUTTER ALIVE, ALIX?!
she had to proof it before baking !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I see Rie in the background😀
Please. Edit the beginning.... Ain't nobody got time fo dat!
I love how at the beginning, Rie is just chilling in the bag round not minding anyone’s business 😂
Rie in the background like omg what she doing while cleaning
More cooking with Alex please
I think she means pan au chocolate
Is it just me or did she not butter the first ones?
I’ve made croissants  and I’m really young but they were really hard but worth
Arent those pain au chocolate
Calling chocolatine "chocolate croissant" is like calling bagels "hole hamburgers", onigiris "fishless sushis" or lasagna "large-surface pasta" ! A chocolatine is NOT a croissant at all !!!
People who noticed rie in the background in round 2 👇👇
The croissant dough didn't work, the butter broke...
You are very stupide
I think she somewhat looks like Leonardo DiCaprio...
*After watching the chocolate croissant video* Me: it looks so easy, I'll try it  *After watching BTS* Me: Nah I am good, I'll buy croissants at the local bakery 😂😂
2:33 imagine if she actually posted this part on a real vid lol
Pain au chocolat > Chocolatine (:
Stoop, i could of drop my croissant😂
Alix is hilarious😆😆 She not finding the dough was the best part...
My friend baked them and gave me one it was good didn’t know it was hard to make damn
It's Quah song
Alix kerjanya jorok
👌👌❤👍🤪🤪
Μπράβο Ελλάδα
Alix is my favourite producer :)
One tip for the croissants, you only have to raise the dough when the croissant is already constructed
I made em it's not really that big a deal
Chocolate croissant- it's pana chocalat (or how spell it lol)
Her struggle produced 10 million views ❤️
Working at Tasty looks adorable 😍
croissants arent in local bakers in my country .. they are sold in luxury bakeries .. sorry Alix =.=
good ass girl
7:20 she looks like Adele
you inspired me to make my own croissants from scratch! I'd love if you checked out my video :)
"so the butter leaked out" insert the hands apart presentation meme  That had me cracking firecrackers
To anyone who is reading this may your life be blessed  I'm also a small YouTuber
Pain au chocolate and I’m English
PAIN AU CHOCOLAT THAT’S NOT A CROISSANT LOL
fact everybody has mucles
“But it’s my job I can’t...”
thats a pain au chocolat Not a croissant
its not a chocolate croissants its called panochocola
She flips her hair and drops the croissants that she worked so hard on.
Rie in the background!
U know they are not called chocolate croissant, they're called pain au chocolat. They are from France a croissant and a paint au chocolat are two different this
"That's hard"😏
Alex is the best producer ever. She is so funny and sweet.
If kelly clarkson was a baker
Who gonna tell her that they aren’t croissants..
Croissants aren't that difficult to do, I've made them loads of times!
The editor of this video deserve a raise
I love Alix so much
What’s up with the sound
It was so random when just someone came to Alix to tell her good luck whit the croissant
I literally sang the song in the background it took forever to learn for choir, its so fast
Drooling
Imagine if she dropped all the croissants on the floor and she had to start all over again
I’m just eating one while watching this
Pulls up with underproofed croissants...
The chocolat croissant is called pain au chocolat
Support your local baker😂😂😂
Kru-sans? isn't it a french pastry?
I had no idea this is how you make them. The French baker that came up with the recipe must've been some sort of alchemist.
Dude at 4:45  Just saying.... 👉👈
I love alix Making style..she never give up..omg..its really helpful wow
Y’all see rie in the back judging her 😂
So chaotic 😂
U guys r great lots of efforts U took to make 1 dish gbu
she looks like a Abby from TLOU Part II
They are called Pain au chocolat which translates to chocolate bread
These are pain au chocolates is everyone smacked in the head chocolate croissants are different things
Rie is also shooting so 2 behind tasty XD
When I went to italy I ate so many chocolate croissants but I never realised how much work they take
Shade Shade Shade
2:17 ...u serious bro...
some poor Bastard is, has or will marry this women ( lol)
بغيت كم تشربو من حوض نبي علية صلاة وسلام رني محتاجكم في قناتي وكندعي معاكم دخلو عندي الله يجازيكم بالخير ويستركم دنيا واخر يارب العالمين 🤲🤲 لبنات حطيت روتين جديد كنتمنا تشوفوه مرحبابكم فقناتي المتواضعة الا عجبتكم شتركو وفعلو لجرس باش يوصلكم فيديوهاتي❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
oh lord I laughed hard when the dough was hard and she started smacking it lol
You are just like me
how many refrigerators do they have ?
I love this video so much😂😂😂😂
The editor is the best😂😂😂 If I gave a blank screen to the editor I know he would make me laugh somehow😂
When she called Claire is it just me or did it look like Claire Saffitz (spelled wrong) from the BA Test Kitchen?
I tried two times before and I gave up, but I think I will try one more time 👍 , But I have a question can I use almond flour?
I love how energetic u r through out the whole time and no matter how many times u had to make the dough all over again, u didn’t lose temper once. Keep up the good work and lots of love ❤️❤️from Bangladesh 🇧🇩
the confident part is my favorite
{\____/} (     :]   ) /  >🥐>🍫
7:19 be PREPARED
Now we know the struggless ☝🏻❕
Whoever is reading this, I hope you have an amazing day!!!✝️❤️
There's Rie in the background!
pawg
I thought those croissants were actually giant, then I found out the were just enlarged
When Alex said hour glass I think I saw an hour glass tattoo on her arm wh9 else saw?
i love watching alix trying to english lol I <3 you alix
7:20  Lol the best part of this video, trolling lol deserve a big like!
Pain au chocolat!
Now THAT is realistic baking! Or at least that is how I bake.
Always triggers me when they call them chocolate croissants... in French croissant means ‘crescent’ which one of these is NOT and also traditionally they are called ‘pain au chocolat’ which translates to ‘chocolate bread’. Hmmmm.
It's a pain au chocolat
I tried to make these today with a recipe from bigger bolder baking. Had the same issues grated butter in. Wish I had seen this video first. Would have attempted your recipe. Well done for persisting.
Those lights probably aren't helping either. Butter is sensitive.
Wearing all black while working with flour was the first mistake she made...
French: on a civil war over if its called « pain au chocolat » or « chocolatine »  Tasty : hold my chocolate croissant
Next person to make croissants:  Alix: never again
6:56 the cuteeeeeest AAAAAH
she kinda looks like florence pugh
In india, we have these similar stuff known as puffs, and they are 20rupees or 15 cents
maaaaaaaan. She is bitterly me when I'm in a camera or a photo
Now I want chocolate croissants
This is making me want to like be a chef or a baker.
Hey alix can you make a giant chocolate croissant
I saw this video in my recommendation and as an french girl I feel offended THOSE ARE NOT CROISSANT CHOCOLATE it’s « pain au chocolat or chocolatine one of these word but don’t say chocolate croissant pls it’s frustrating
I just love the disclaimers!
I LOVE Rie, greetings from Mexico
I just made croissant once and it was totally failed. After watching this video, I feel I am not alone. I am confident for another try. Thanks
very tasty))
alix: Hi guys im alix im a tasty producer subtitles:Hi guys im Alix im a TV producer
To be honest, I've watched this atleast 15 times  SERIOUSLY
Chocolatine✨
She’s my favourite I love her personality she’s so funny and sweet
Alix: chocolate croissant Me: excuse me, it’s actually Pain au chocolat
Ughh how can I work for them all I do is bake when I’m home!!!
I'dont know how many times I watched this videos ,she so cute every time I see her I clink
Rie's face at 2:31 tho 😂
It’s a PAIN AU CHOCOLAT
Great video, I'll try to make them! 😍🤤 Note: in France, these are known as «pain au chocolat» or «chocolatine» depending on the region.
5:08 never laughed so hard!! Takes 3 days how do you guys make a croissant! Time to come look inside a belgian bakery and see what baking is! 3 days🤣🤣🤣
The making video has 10 times more views than the actual video
What she lacks in baking skills she makes up for with smiles and baking skills 😊
I made croissants today and trust me, I was every bit anxious while making it. Took me a total of frikkin 20hrs. But it was very fulfilling and magnificent when u finally get to have the taste of it.
I miss this segment. and also the old tasty 😅
France : ChOCoLaTInE Belgium : pain au chocolat  English : chocolat CROISSANT 🤬
Anyone think she swapped out her own croissants for someone else's? The one she made had only one bar of chocolate in the middle, but the one in all the photos and close ups clearly has two, distinct, thinner bars
i don't y am i enjoying behind tasty if its alix lol
That intro was priceless!
pain  au chocolat
PAIN AU CHOCOLAT
alix in etempt 2: this is hard       me: RIE IS BEHIND YOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
That's a pan au chocolate
Title chocolate Croissant Me in my “better than your voice” actually they’re called pain au chocolat (pronounced pan-oo-shock-er-lar)
Stoooopp u could've dropped my croissant
How dare you call this a "chocolate croissant" ?? It is *not* a croissant !! It is a "pain au chocolat". I can not tolerate such a mistake !! In the name of my baguette, I'm going to report your video to Macron.
in france we actually call them "pain au chocolat"
1 thing this is un pain a chocolate in French Xd
Alix, "As you can see I am not going to wear black again." The last day, wears black again
Anyone else notice Rie in the background? She looks so serious with whatever she’s doing😂😂
UMM I'm french and we don't call this a CHOCOLAT CROISSANT
so...they’re not pro chefs or anything? i really don’t know pls don’t judge me
I’m just curious... why does Alix keep looking up?
I love that she never gives up... She's always happy happy happy ..
The part where the can can music started fitted in perfectly with the video cause its croissants and the producer of the music is french
If I learned anything - support your local Baker 😂 priceless
I love Alix so much (and not just because we spell our names the same way)
Tasty: “chocolate croissant”   Me: that isn’t a croissant...
I just realized that she looks a lot like Ivy Dickens from Gossip Girl
okay lmao this video is scaring me cuz im planning on making croissants soon and i wanna get it right lol
I love this girl omg
Welcome to another episode of Alix having a breakdown over baking
O.M.G who wouldn't eat anything from those beautiful hands . thanks for this recipe
ABSOLUTELY love the video !
5:34 me when I have 3 projects, 5 exams and a big pile of homework due tomorrow
Her voice and the way she smiles is sooo... Cute so positive ♥️
0:23 you sure about it ?
I’m just watching her videos over again due to lockdown 😂❤️
I love Alex❤️She have such a great personality🤗And I love her tips for baking😊😊
Is the dough for croissant same with puff pastry?
Wohoo
i like how they have the periodic song in the background lmaooo
I don’t wanna be gross but this croissants look like they’re pooping. I’m so sorry Ik she worked hard just me being me
Alix, marry me. I need your smile and your baking in my life.
Anyone tried it?..how was it pls...
those are chocolatines not chocolate croissants
How did she acc think these were chocolate croissants, it’s pain au chocolat
this bothers me so much cus like,, those aren't croissants. they're pain au chocolat. please stop.
at first cute  then not so much at some point its just wasting food just get the right recipe and bloody follow it...
Can u advise how many hours should the dough rest in the refrigerator each time, and the whole process takes how many hours?
If she was a food she’d be a cinnamon roll
2:17 that was sooo hysterical. I ran out of breath.. omg she's so sweet.. 😂
I like how they didn’t cut out her messing up the intro
I. Love. Alex.
Sees rie in the background
3:08 Hi Rie!! 😃😃
6:17- 6:33   Is when I fall asleep in science
She just never gives up and smiles
"HAHA I'M GONNA HAVE A MENTAL BREAKDOWN HIHI"
They arr not croissins are pain au chocolate in french
Alix is literally me everytime I try to bake 😂❤
So I started making these today and the struggle that had with the dough is that I put in to much flour in them I got so frustrated. Watching her do it is amazing how she can do that without getting mad
I’ve never seen anyone make croissants like this before...it’s hilarious 😂❤️❤️❤️ love her lol
The end killed me LOL
She is so cute..
Me: looks at thumbnail  Wow those croissants are *huge*
It's not a chocolate croissant, it's a chocolatine or a pain au chocolat
ANYONE ELSE WATCH THIS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT NOT TO DO WHEN ATTEMPTING THESE DESERTS
I love her!! Hahahahaha so witty and cute! LoVe from SL
not only she's making a hard dish, she has to make it aesthethic in the video tok
If some one sees this follow me on tiktok @avacado81308 plssss
I love how Alix can’t make an intro but can make amazing food
This woman is very annoying!!  Wasting my time, I could not watch her!
Alix: This is soo hard.   French People: Hold my croissant.
Watching Alex actually struggle gives me hope
Everyone else: Oop, those are hard to make. Don’t mess up! Hannah: Oh my Gosh they look amazing!!   In conclusion, Hannah is too pure for this world.
Alix your amazing 😂😂😂
Difference between the tasty kitchen and my kitchen is that if she does any mistakes she can like recreate them like 10 time...........    But at my kitchen if it's wrong u still have ti eat and be happy with it 😁😁 U know but still I respect those chefs
She is adorable.. I want to be her friend
Alex: ITS TOO HARD Rie: *in the back casually carrying a whole microwave*
I made crossient one time . .Never again So, good luck🙃😆
It’s called a pain au chocolate
Please make croissant 101
I miss alix behind tasty
I made chocolate croissants today... never again! It's soooooooo hard and it takes so much time😪  From now on I will eat everything croissant related with respect
this so not exciting to watch.
This is why a lot of people like tasty, they don’t just make it look easy and effortless in their video, they show you what the baker went through to get the perfect croissant.
I love baking and this channel is my inspiration ❤🎂
2020: 1042
She didn't laminate with butter in the squares in the first attempts. 🤔
Why would she do the first recipe without the butter layer? Doesnt she have a recipe onhand?
Before this video I hadn't watched Tasty since the layoffs.  It wasn't a conscious choice.  It just happened.
You mean : Pain au chocolat
It's a pan au chockalat not a chocklat crason why oh why did you get this rong 😢
Tip: you can put your dough in the fridge if it is too wer 😉
Always love to watch alix :)
every once in a while this video pops up in my mind and I need to watch it, idk why I love it so much
Just watch not thicc Alix video... Oh how much I missed thicc Alix 😢😢😢
Tip. When the dough is solid you should be pressing and rocking sode to side until it rolls. Saves work.is better. 💪
As a French person, her calling them "chocolate croissants" has me offended
I made crossiant's afew days ago and the were VERY easy and good
It's like in Jackie Chan movies, when after the credits or while the credits you see all failed scenes from the movie.
kid There Pain Au Chocolat
pain au chocolat it is!!!
Hmmm you so funny your dont gave instructions i think is not deal videos for you
omg subscribed for more alix
Alex you is  Beautiful Cute Awesome Funny  And always happy😍😍😍😍😍😍
In professional bakeries they will have dough sheeters or pastry rollers made specifically for laminating puff pastry and croissants. So don’t feel bad for your local baker but your baker friend who made Pain au chocolat.
Giant croissants?
I was about to make it but after watching your incredible trying I guess it's a no from me :))
-"Croissants take 3 days" I can make them in 1 day believe it or not. I follow Bruno Albouze's method and rapidly cool and rest the dough so it can be folded without the dough stretching back. Done it many times, tasted wonderful, looked wonderfull, flaky, buttery. Maybe its just to develop dough flavor for 12 hours.
She’s so hot 🔥
No offense you're not that funny at all... just give us a recipe thank you very much
This chicks eyes man 😍😍
Dose anyone else call chocolate croissants pan au choclat ( the french name)   I'll go up to a cafe and ask for a pan au choclat and they will just stare at me.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't pain in French mean bread ?
ALIX LOOKS LIKE FLORENCE PUGH
They aren’t called chocolate croissant
You need to thaw it first for 3-5hours in the chiller before rolling.
My question is where does all of the failed thing go?
This is pain au chocolat not a chocolate croissant xD
“I could’ve dropped my croissant”
I LOVE HER A VOICE SO MUCH
My version:   Just go to Starbucks 🥰
She’s that one friend we all wish we had. ❤️😂
I never knew crossisant was that hard
I make a great croissant
Hi
Love this girl. The struggle is real. But once you figure it out there's always a new dish to learn.
PAIN AU CHOCOLAT
PAIN AU CHOCOLAT
Came to see the croissonts but all i saw was cake, not mad.
I want Rie, Alix, Alexis and Alvin to make a giant croissant
Upskirt shot @ 7:19 😁
For better shape,cut it into small triangles and roll it from tips and after that bend it smoothly.
It'll be easier  if u use pastry butter instead of normal unsalted buter. They have higher melting point than the normal butter 😉😁
When alix put the butter in I started smelling butter and I just woke up so I was smelling my phone seeing if the smell came through but it was my mum making pancakes 🥞
Oof
It’s so cool that they have their own stations
It’s pain au chocolat.
omg it's a pain au chocolat not chocolate croissant what the
5:10 Claire.... Saffitz???? From BA??
You’re a tasty producer? I didn’t know producers were tasty, yuck! Go Vegan❣️💚✅🌱
I've been working on a croissant recipe for 3-4 months now.  After about 20 or so tries, I am now able to produce that classic honeycomb structure 50 percent of the time.  So time-consuming and frustrating, but beyond rewarding when it turns out.
it's really not that difficult...
This is originally called "Pain au Chocolat", Chocolate Bread (barbarian translation).
She’s so cute!!
why’s nobody talking about that mark at 2:17 😂
:)
I'm watching this while eating a chocolate croissant
me be like:  Rieeeee~
Rie: *working on her own thing* Alix: *smashing her dough*
https://youtu.be/PxJsBmwZLZI
Look at rie in the background just minding her own business
c'est des chocolatines
Ffs ‘chocolate croissant’ 🤦🏼‍♂️
No one:  Me: 5:34
It’s a pain au chocolatine croissant.
Noooo !!! Is "pain au chocolat" not "chocolate croissant" !!! For French people that hurt ... please respect us
ITS CALLED "PaIn Au ChOcOlAt" YOU EST SUCH A BOOMER
her face of joy and self proud at 7:16 !!!!!!!!!!
Very beautiful and has the most attractive personality I’ve seen in a long time! Wow just wow!
Alix has like one of the best personalities you can ask for. I love her sooo much
I am half Italian and that reminds me of some of the pastries that they make at cafes/ bakeries : D
Paetis xd
Who else is here in 2020 and miss Alix
Them croissants look excactly like school ones but more chocolate and powdered sugar on top
I wonder how much of the ingredients have been wasted.....
i rly just want to be friends with her
That sass at the end.... It made this process much more perfect and fun.
at 5:10 is that claire from BA test kitchen or am i going nuts?
I love you!!!! I’m obsessed with your videos!!!
Living for her possibility 😍 just her smiling is really lovely to watch ❤️❤️❤️
I love everything about this channel. And please make more videos behind the scenes
ITS PAIN AU CHOCOLAT  PAIN AU CHOCOLAT
Can Alix marry me
3:33 why does the have a White flower handprint on her butt
Her voice is annoying...
What I learned from this is:   I should’ve appreciated the chocolate croissants on our cruise we went on more-
Omg she’s so freaking adorable, I want to hug her 😄
I thought croissants are curved
*starbucks has entered the chat*
Yummy......
They are actually called pain au chocola
It's called "Pain au chocolat" And I think it's called like that because it causes a lot of pain.
she literally look like NikkieTutorials
She struggles so U don’t have too
Usually I cut in half the croissant and I put Nutella inside. Trust me is delicious
I’m French and nobody in France call this “chocolate croissant”. It’s called PAIN AU CHOCOLAT 😇🇫🇷❤️🤍💙
The thumbnail shows a pain au(x?) chocolat, not a croissant
Ft rie in the back 🤣
who else whats to see more of alix     MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
who thinks they should make chocolate flavor croissants.
My God, the things I would do to ALix..
2:30 rie picks up an entire oven
Useless as a tutorial cooking video 🙄
1:59 isthat Rie in the back??
This bitch is annoying couldn’t finish the vid
I was really interested, but I didn't like it.
Alix you're one cool human being
I love this video cause mine suck too
She backed what we call in Spain "napolitana" not a chocolate croissant! It was a great video buuutt... that's not a croissant
2:28 is that rie ???
pain au chocolat ou chocolatine? 😂
Is she Florence pugh sister?
I love her! You are so pretty!
Her smile🥺❤️❤️ I'm in love. Again.
Alix: struggling to make croissants  Reha(or however u spell her name) : just casually picking up a microwave in the background
In France there is two types of people:  The ones who call it "Pain au chocolat"  And the ones who call it "Chocolatine"  guys it's a PAIN AU CHOCOLAT.
Wtf
Crissont
Watching this while eating a crossing
it took a professional chef 9 days to make it while the original video makes it seem so easy and achievable in the first attempt lmaooooo that is why never believe everything you see on the internet
Rie is just holding a microwave looking at Alix. 😂
Now i know if where did the 5 minute crafts get clips
So cheerful 💛💛
They are called pan au chocolate
Cooox gozelsene sen 🥰
Aaa she’s so cuteeeee!! 😂
Alix before filming: 😊  During filming: 🥺🤬🥵😖  After filming: 🤪😇😁😭😀😆
I like it how u can see Rie in the background not failing at all but Alix is good no offence
I want to see Alix and Claire make a video together.
Chocolate croissants?? Um don’t u mean pain au chocolate?? 😂 I am British btw 🤦🏼‍♀️
they're called petit pains not croissants (croissants are moon shaped)
You did not just call those lumps croissants
That’s a petit pain or pain au chocolat not croissants
BIG UP!!!! never give up...hip hip hip hourra ALIX
she thicc
PAIN-AU-CHOCOLAT, not chocolate croissants
Those are pain au chocolat, but okay I guess.
Rie giving Alex a round of applause was the most wholesome thing by far in this video
alix: struggling
Waiting for my croissant dough to rise rn, watching this to pass the time and rethink my life
Awwn, she is so cute!
Je suis tellement surprise !! Un pain au chocolat s’écrit "Chocolate croissant" en anglais
2:32.  Lol you just see Rie in the background moving a microwave minding her business like😂😂😂
I think she is probably the most destructive chef i haver ever seen in TASTY but still like her 😊
White panties alert 7:19
Has anyone else noticed what it said on her first shirt
It's "pain au chocolat", not chocolat croissant... this is French cuisine please
I just love her so much! Love the way she struggles and doesn't care at all hahah
1:34 I was about to comment this......
You almost made me drop my croissant
When you put the dough in the refrigerator overnight, maybe ghosts will see it at 3:00 AM
Making a Pain au Chocolat or a Croissant is a massive undertaking for anyone who's not a professional baker.  I think the end result is really beautiful and impressive.
i thought u guys made tasty y in a white kitches but is sad to know the room is all dark
She is like a real life version of Amethyst from Steven Universe
Soooooo cute 😍
Those sucks
Those are not crossant..croissant need yeast
Just Rie chilling in the background
I feel like the ppl are telling you to give up
This was too annoying to watch. 🙄
Does anyone know the proper name for a Croissant, which is best described as either heart or "V" (as opposed to crescent shaped) shaped yet filled with ground nuts and honey almost akin to a Baklava?
Pain au chocolat  Your country didn’t make them you don’t get to rename them
It's called pain in chocalate
I ❤️Croissants dear let it melt
Rie at 2:30 in the background 😂😂😂😂
Alex Was Shock That she Finnaly Finish That she Bake Nad Then Came out Like A Pro But she Finish It For 3days
I can't watch her videos because I'm starting to fall for her. Too bad.
alex u r soooo beuty 😍
She's cute af
Its pain au chocolat not chocolate croissant
That dough...doh.... 😂
Why would you post a video that took you 4 days to make because it's so hard on a channel that provides easy recipes 😂
Love your positive attitude. You were so funny 😂  just love this video and i was keep smiling through out the video. Learnt one big lesson . love from Malaysia 💕
They are called Pain au chocolate not chocolate croissants
I think you should keep the dough set a side for half hour after keep it out from fridge.
Wait, the first time she tried and it was too wet right? It was just that the butter had softened a little too much. Couldn't she have just put it in the fridge or freezer for a little while to set up more? Then she could go about the recipe without having to restart.
Shoutout to the first attempt immediately being soggy this is my spirit woman
ALIX ! Those are not croissants ! This misconseption is killing us! ! Just as much as  the  fact that we are "stinky"?! PAIN-AU-CHOCOLAT G**DAMMIT! Love you still <3
Anyone else see Rie at 2:32 carrying a microwave looking at alix??
“Chocolate croissant”  😡😡😡😡 that’s a pain au chocolat
Alix is the cutest thing ever
She's so cute:(( She reminds me of someone from some show or something I can't remember!! Ughh
I’m French and here in France we say « Pain au chocolat » not croissant au chocolat 😇
But they just make it look so easy!?!?
Buzzfeed cooking in a nutshell: Grownups fooling around with ingredients.    Why don't  they just research the measures and quantities instead of wasting a shit tone of ingredients and therefore money.
Where are you these days??
I need to meet this angel of a person in real life
I wish i work at tasty.... Trying recipes until you get them right... Filming, editing.... #dreamjob Reality: Most of the time you can't afford the ingredients for so many attempts, so just get one from the baker.
5 : 25 Is that Hannah!!!?
😑👎
They're not croissants they are pan au chocolat croissants are the ones in a crescent shape hence the name croissant which is crescent in French
No Croissant, but looks tatsy
emilia clarke clickbait
Isn't it a pain au chocolat?
Is Alix no longer on tasty? She didnt film anything lately there . Or i missed it ?
6:25 *SCIENCE!*
Luckily she don't say:"hello i am croissants"
Im just gonna but some from panera
Who saw rea is in the back ground
I don't want to be rude but, just go ask starbucks
No one: Me:that’s a pan u chocolate
2:23 the best scene. Alix suffering but Rie is so calmly working in the background 😂😂😂😂😅😅but you both are best
Chocolate Croissant aka Pain au Chocolate
4:54 me thinking about my life's decisions
Oh wow. I love Alix now! 😁
Alix *rolling the dough* : This is a workout  Rie in the bg : I'll just lift up this microwave real quick
what's keeping Rie busy at the back? 😂
Omg you are so sexy...<3
You know what I really love about these videos you know when like professional chefs make these videos and you're like oh that is so easy I can make those anytime I love that Alex shows you the real world experience and she's got such a positive energy which I love as well. And this is my 25th time watching this exact same video I love it.💖
Good job Alex ...
Why did you use the periodic table song??? 😂
How did you call them? .  .  .  .  Chocolate croissants?  .  .  The French are going to start WW3
Well this was a disgrace to France
After seen all the work she made, I actually feel proud of her
THAT!!!! My fellow Tasty friends ... is a PAIN AU CHOCOLAT
is this the day that she finally wears a bra????
Please, And I mean please, for the love of god. Its Pain Au Chocolat
Merry her.. Merry her faster
The periodic table song in the background 🤔
This is painful to watch
She is sweeter than chocolate it self
napolitaine, not chocolate croissants
Perfect woman!
Thumbs up for perseverance. These last ones are french approved ^^
Just wanna get some of that
I give you props Girl.
Who else watches these videos and only came for Alex
there're in fact called "pain au chocolat" but in the south of France, people call it "chocolatine".
This video makes me sad for two reasons: 1. The lack of appreciation for bakers who make croissants 2. THE AMOUNT OF FOOD BEING WASTED HERE (Sorry, love the content, but come on)
Yes, agree. I made this at school with old style make dough and put the butter in side and roll it and always broken(made me cry) and need to wait and cool and roll again and cool again and roll and the result like cookies dough...i hate make pastry actually hahaha
This is called a pain au chocolat . Chocolate croissant is a completely different thing
7:25     When you win the lottery
Why is it that chefs at Tasty always mess up recipes and names for foods... It's like they're purposely trying to trigger people
Well since you've messed up the dough recipe no wonder ur having so much trouble with it
Do you throw away the good dough if something does not work 😳
If you just made a traditional puff pastry just to start this video would be like 5 minutes long lol
As a french I feel insulted every time she says 'chocolate croissant', in France we call it pain au chocolat, so it would be more relevant to call it chocolate bread in English also.
Rie: how many times you fold-  Alix: I lost counts....   Rie: Owh............
5:33 "Hehe- your gonna have a mental break down."
OGahd  My favorite !!  With cuppa coffee
Rie was like 'what yah doin bruh? '
"OMG! this looks amazing!"  "IT'S BUTTER!"
Click bait that's a pan du chocolate croissants are folded in a triangular fashion
*pinches nose*....Hi im Al- Hi im Alex
Rie in the background ME:😂😂😂😂😂
for someone who is a baker and see this is kinda funny :) and it's looks great
She is awesome  Who else thinks that  Also I'm trying to hit 1k plz like me
Alix: struggling  Rie: *yall hear sumn?*
her top says so much internet to do, lmao so relatable
Someday Tasty will produce a version of "Behind the behind scenes"...😂
It's really funny when she had the glasses when opened the door
isn't that called a pain au chocolat, not a croissant?
Alix is making chocolate croissants while I’m eating pizza for breakfast
before cooking you should let them rise for 2 or 3 hours.
I wish she was my wife, what a wonderful woman she is. Her body drives me nuts, wish I could get just a kiss. For any keyboard warriors, this little sentence is for you, I'm using my freedom of speech to state that I want to eat her croissant roll, so leave me alone, unless u want to prove my point about stupid validated keyboard warrior comments.
im eating a chocolate croissant .        from Starbucks cuz I can’t cook
What is Rie doing with the microwave igen????
As of October 2019, Alix has officially left Tasty and moved on to something else, from us all Alix, if your reading this, thank you for making us laugh and showing us great recipes, I hope that what ever career you’ve moved on to you are successful and most importantly, have fun! We love you Alix, and we can all remember what good times we had with these videos. Again, Thank you.  “I do not claim to be a good baker”                        -Alix Trager
Alix:"AHHHH IT LOOKS GOOD!" Also Alix:*Kicks the door open while wearing shades with some fine looking chocolate croissants*
My French heart is broken ! Pain au chocolat PLEASE ! Not chocolate croissant ! 😭😭😭😭
Alix you are amazing... 😍😍😍💜
Olive Garden Breadstick or Auntie Ann's Pretzel Dog.  One of the two.
Alix is like the best friend you’ve always wanted
This is actually called a "pan au chocolate"
Everyone vowing to never make them again makes me want to master the croissant.
I felt this, currently on day 2 of making them, never again
Now, this probably won't be seen but: Have you ever had a major corruption in a video? Like all the footage just corrupted?
as a french person "chocolate croissants" really hurt my feelings Lmao
Love your energy and the smile hahaa
“ It’s been about 20 minutes baking” Me: THERE BURNING!
It's. Not chocolate croissants It's pain au chocolat
Oh my god I know people already said it etc but PLEEEEEASE you can say "pain au chocolat" or "chocolatine" or even "petit pain" but NEVER EVER EVER EVER EVER "croissant au chocolat". It's not a fucking croissant !! x'D
The ending when she was crying and the girl in the back was clapping LOL I LOST IT XD HAHAHA
Wish I could work with them ....
omg they're called paun o chocolate
I'm sorry, but I find it rude as f*** for people to call pain au chocolat, "chocolate croissants"?? The literal translation is chocolate bread. It's like if I called a hamburger, a "pain au jambon", I'm not telling you guys to learn the french language, but don't go confusing croissants with "chocolate croissants", please.
Alix: If i've learned anything in these 9 days is support your local baker 😂😂😂
So cute! I was smiling ear-to-ear! Thank you, Alix! :) <3
2:16 that's hot
I always end up looking for more videos of Alix, but I find out that I watched almost all of them.. 😂😂
U guys are hilarious.. The qoute part 😂😂
Why does she proof neither the dough at any point, nor proof the Croissants before cooking for fucks sake?
Why does no one ever pronounce croissant correctly - plus it’s not even a croissant it’s pan au chocolat
I love how this entire video is just Alix struggling, while Rie is calmly in the background cooking with grace 😂
i half expected her to take a bite and say "it's not even that good"
Pls Marry me alix😍😍
you mean Pain au chocolat?
Hey Alix! They look delicious but allow me to say these are "pain au chocolat".. not croissant :) I can teach you few more details to make it easier.
her voice/laugh is so cute tho
it’s a pAIN AU CHOCOLAT
idk why but she always reminds me of nikkitutorials :')
I may not be french but....its called pain au chocolat
When rie is the star even tho it’s not her video
I've facepalmed when she grated the butter into the flour...
Cinnamon roll croissants sound like a delicious idea   Support small YouTubers like me
Yeast in a croissant?
I love Alix so muchhh 😭💖
I love her hairstyle on day 2! ❤
still never boring watch her 7:18 omgosh
8:42 is it just me or does she look like Adele
It’s pronounced pain a chocolat
And this was the first time we fell in love with Alix
I love how much ballet music is in this video lol
Has anyone heard of V or heart shaped Croissants, have seen it being sold yet can find no information on them?
Stop smoking so much weed
Those chocolatines look delicious!
She seems to be so kind, and generous She seems like my own sister😭♥️, alex is the best
This is my favorite video on tasty
This is my favorite video on tasty
J
These look exactly like the ones in Starbucks!
These are not even "croissants" they're "pains au chocolat"
Not croissants though? But still liking for Alix
Watching this after making my own croissants. Took 6 freaking hours
Amazing job Alix!!! Love this never give up spirit of urs !!!!!
7:19 Might need some editing. Triumphant upskirt!
i would die for her personality shes so great she so positive and always smiling i love her
that's not a croissant, that's pain au chocolat
I just watched a video about "pain au chocolat" vs "chocolatine" I laughed really hard when I read "chocolate croissants" in the title
2019 anyone
This is soooo hard to watch!!  Why is she making this hrad pastry dough and not a puff pastry or a Danish pastry dough?
I love her confident. If it was me I would through away and buy
I made croissants every day in culinary school, we made the dough a day ahead though,  your butter is melting that's all you did wrong, your dough looks too warm as well you can tell by the feel.
Such a proud mom moment right now 😂😂😂
Whats the name of the man on 4:42? 😍
Rie is in the background. lol
So no one else notices how thick she is man???
That's not a croissant
I’m Spanish and when I read “chocolate croissant” I thought it would be a croissant 🥐  with (somehow) chocolate in it, not that
I love Alix Cuz she is funny and She never give up! I love other tasty producers too so Don't worry!
IT'S CHOCOLATINE!!!!!!!!!!
5:24  Hannah 😍😇
Tasty I love your channel!!
Omg alex you the reason i subscribed and watching you videos 5x i love ur smile and laugh 💜
now everytime i see a chocolate croisant i just think of alix having a breakdown
Alix: *claims not to be a good baker.* Me: *looks down at the lousy sandwich I made*
Freeze the butter1
So we all gonna pretend that she isnt overall the prettiest tasty producer? Alright. Lol
The same thought after I made croissants 9 times... support your local bakers
*WHERE DID SHE GET HER SHIRT IT'S MAJESTIC TELL ME AAAAAAAAAAAAAA* *_it's the first attempt_*
Alix is such a ray of sunshine
me watching tasty: oh that would be easy i just need those ingredents.  me watching tasty behind the scenes: omg this chef takes day just to make that croissant perfect.
I want to be Alix's best friend
Wait. Is tasty just a bunch of photographers making food?!
I wanted to yell butter thru the screen at the start.... 😂 Looked amazing 🎉
Disclaimer : I am not the best Baker even not avg 😂
What Rubbish???
her laugh so contagious
They must be wonderful neighbors. I love the energy around them. ❤❤❤
🤭
Faut lui dire que c’est un pain au chocolat et non un croissant 🤦🏻‍♀️
So so charming alix❤️❤️❤️
y
i made this in one  day without breaking a sweat that too being a dude. Well i guess if she stops giggling and laughing and focus maybe she can do it too.
You guys should naturally have Alex’s mic low, not to be mean but she’s naturally loud so you’re always gonna get a lot of mic blowout. Just a tip
I love this video it was so funny 😁😂 🤣
When Nicky and Andrew are challenged to make chocolate croissants, Alix” I made croissants once I swore never again”
@7:23 Imagine the croissants falling off the tray
This ain’t a chocolate croissant. It’s a pan au chocolate fgs
Ok this video has got on my nerves so bad I will never watch tasty videos again. And I am not exaggerating right now.
7:20 does she not have any panties on?
Thats not a croissant its called a panichocolate
Pain au chocolat please god !
Aren’t those pain au chocolate?
I wonder how much food these people waste hahaha worth it though god damn if only I had an oven...
Those are pain au chocolat
I made chocolate croissants, I would make them again.
She looks like Emelia clarke😂❤
5:17 Who tf beeps out the word “dammit”?😂😂
LOL! Great video! The closest that I have ever come to making chocolate croissants is making the ones sold at Trader Joe's! Three steps: 1. removed frozen from box; 2. Defrost over night on baking sheet; 3. Bake! After watching this clip, I think I'll stick to Trader Joe's! But I applaud Alex's determination. I would've thrown in the towel after the 2nd attempt. 😅
Her smile is just awesome, and she's fine as hell too... Whoever has her is VERY Lucky!
everybody: Croissont         Tom Holland: *QuAksEn*
As a kid, I can roll that thing much easier than your first try. Still, I practice gymnastics, so it should be fine
Omg I love alix personality 😁 I can relate so much 🤣
I like how rie is her best friend and she was just looking at her in the background
Il ne s’agit pas de croissants mais de pains au chocolat !!
Waste of my time
can't stand this stupid bozo
Wow she so cute persistent love her😍😘😍😘
Was I the only one who heard Jeon Jungkook?
I love alix
Get ur know before u make a vid
It’s Accra pan à choco-late 😩
She forgot the butter lol
7:27 she looks like white canary
Alix is my favourite producer of Tasty because she's always laughing, never giving up and she's just such a cheering lovely person😍😍
Why do you look like a mixed emilia clarke and leonardo di caprio
Alix is my senpai in cooking
Voilà pourquoi c’est un métier boulanger en France 🇫🇷
Maybe the croissants are sweet but the sweetest in this video is at 4:44
I’m surprised that almost nobody was talking about the “AAAAAH! STOP I COULD’VE DROPPED MA CROISSANTS” vine
*see her folding dough* "Are you making croissants?" 😂
The right name of the chocolate croissant is pain au chocolat
grandma taught me 1 important thing... never fold it more than 8 times
I tried it and i got it in the first time all because of your recipe so thank you and it wasn’t that hard
4.50 and I: 😅😍😍😍.....
Not to be that bitch but isn’t that a pain au chocolat ???
My dad makes normal croissants every week in one or 2 hours
That’s a pan aux something hing
So she could have gotten it right the first time if she just turned up the temperature-
I’m craving sweets now
Can I just point out that they’re pain au chocolat and not croissants 😂
Wtf in Europe their called pain au chocolat?! Is it just me who calls them that?🤣🤣
anyone notice rie 2:26?
*pain au chocolat
That whole bit from 7:19 to 7:30 is such a mood of bliss. Hahahaha
"Support your local bakers" HAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAH
i relate to Alix alot more than the others
This is pain au chocolat .
Okay can I have recipes for this please cause you haven't put the amounts of ingredients you are using
Shes so bubbly, shes probably an animal in the sack.
She's just so adorable 💕
support your local bakers lmao
IT’S NOT CHOCOLATE CROISSANT IT IS CALLED ´PAIN AU CHOCOLAT’
I love watching Alix
The fact that this has been watched more than the original says something
*sorry that i misspoke ONCE.*
5:14
Let’s go alix 😂
why she does not use an apron? dude she is thi c c
The funny thing is,,,, it’s not a croissant 😔
I love her personality😂
I thought you guys were pro chefs and bakers and all and I’m 13 and I know that is NOT a “chocolate crossiant” that my friend, what she made is called a PAIN AU CHOCOLAT!!
*chocolatine*
Respect
I hope u know that they are called PAIN AU CHOCOLAT it’s FRENCH FFS
No wonder I always failed on the 1st try. I keep telling myself how can I be good on a 1st try just like the tasty video. This proof that ain't no human is perfect.
Why do they keep looking up?
I'm French and here we say "pain au chocolat" so it's really fun to see in the title "chocolate croissants"
I love her, but did she do ANY research before she started?
My face even hurts while looking at her face damn she cannot stop smiling! Im obviously jealous. Must be nice😪
0:15  Hi hi hi hi crush 😍
Why do her voicecracks sound so cute for some reason?
“I COULD HAVE DROPPED MY CHOCOLATE CROISSANT!!!”
Alix is my fav <3
7:16 😂
Alia can mess up over and over but still is always smiling also  who thinks her voice cracks in a cute way
Creo que me enamore , que buena personalidad.
That boi with the maroon shirt is lowkey fine 👌🏻
Das ist fantastish. Layes  r 2 die fo.
Croissants are normally rolled with triangle shaped/cut out dough oof
Rie in the background 😂😂
I love the one and only ....       *BACKGROUND RIE*
I thought she made giant croissants because of the thumbnail...
My recipe:  ***Buys Chocolate*** ***Buys a plain croissant*** Add the chocolate to the middle of the croissant and enjoys! ((:  Alix Traeger (Tasty) recipe  Add one cups sugar to 1/4 cups butter at exactly at 10° angle and at exact room temperature. Therefor if the room is 24° then the butter and sugar purée should be too. Next add exactly 2/7.899127 inches of a tablespoon of the cooked Waikiki meatballs into a 6 centimetre radius metal Walgreens aisle 3 sheet pan. Then milk the dough ball and eat the flour, oh shoot don’t forget the 1/3 plastic red tablespoon full of baking soda and baking powder mixture add these at angle of preference. Then add 6 or 7 ounces of butterscotch fish flavouring powder (MUST be the off brand kind). Then realize you messed up and must REDO EVERYTHING tomorrow and the next day until the ninth day where you get it right and the whole Tasty production company eats all your chocolate croissants before you do ):  NO HATE TO ALIX AT ALL I LOVE HER SO MUCH!!! <3<3<3<3(:(:(:(:
im baking those same exact ones in the oven right now
2:31 Rie ( pls tell me if I spelled that right) just casually taking a microwave.....?!    ^~^
You tried to break my French heart with the first attempt, when you mix the butter with the flour dough !  But this is okay, because you learned, it was your first attempt at making these, etc ... What really ruined me is the name : those ain't croissant, but pain au chocolat (or chocolatine, but that is a term only -heretics- -idiot- a minority use). Misnaming these can actually start a civil war in France (it could not be frenchiest : civil war, revolution, and food).
She. Is. My. Crush.
Whats alix youtube Channel
Love these videos but you should remove your rings when working with your hands!!
Love the video! But it’s unhygienic to wear a ring and knee dough.....
2:47 not sure if I commented on this before (or if anyone else did), but I guess you can say that this part is something to CRACK UP about   d;
I want chocolate croissants   There not vegan       I WANT IT  *cries*
she’s cute🤣🤣😂😂😂
Pain au chocolat
pretty sure everyone admired Rie in the background more than Alix 😂😂
Alix, despite the multiple attempts you are so awesome when you just smile despite the difficulties! Kudos for being that wonderful ray of sunshine to us viewers
*rie in the background just looking at alix*
Im in love with alix :c
2:15 I wish that was my dick XD
Stop touching your ear and then touch the dough
Guys! Just because she calls it a “Chocolate Croissant” not Pain Au Chocolate, doesn’t mean y’all can go and correct every little thing! It’s just a name! Plus the “Pain” is what she probably felt while making them!! Plus in the description box, when they give you the full recipe, they do also call it a Pain Au Chocolate! Please stop, it’s the smallest thing!
Not a croissant .
So I’m on a diet, this makes me feel hungry and stronger at the same time, Oof now I’m craving chocolate croissants 😭
These are pain au chocolat not chocolate croissants
I  hate this ,, Oh oh, yes” (8:29)  😅😂
America calls them chcoclate croissant? Since there from France, they are actually called pan au chocolat
I love chocolate *quacksons*
it's called "pain au chocolate" not chocolate croissants
there not called chocolate croissants there called pain au chocolat
5:41 is when she does it properly
5:19 dam is not a bad word
7:36 I expected something like this to happen
I'm one hell of a butler
Pain au chocolat.
Tasty videos are so much more fun to watch with Alix  Love it
Who else goes to the “Tasty” App and searches for the recipes from the “Behind The Scenes” Episodes?
I made chocolate croissants once and it went better than expected! Thanks random stranger on the internet who posted the recipe !😂
I love you girl!!!!
Do more "Behind Tasty"! I love seeing Alix do this and I've watched this the 8th time in a row!
2:23 Alix: struggling to roll out dough Ríe: moving a microwave in the background
7:28 what if she dropped the croissants  😂😂
8:30...behind the scenes of behind the scenes xDDD
7:25 it seems like she’s saying dont touch me i’m the greatest baker hahahahhaha lol
5:09 “that butter just popped like a pimple” -Alix   I’m literally dying
Editors, please turn down their mic audio a tad. Its ear piercing.
She's getting Fattier🙄 and becoming more cute ..
It keeps breaking because u put butter in the dough! If it’s a good yeast dough you only fold it in..
If you use enough butter when folding you don’t put any in the dough :( also it’s not called chocolate croissant...
You' re supposed to cut the dough into triangles, not rectangles or squares.
The editor is soo funny wid the edits😂💔
If I learned anything in the last eight days its...Support your local bakers😂😂😂
Alix is cute and always smilling
Alix is best
I love alix so much she’s so cute
This is the cutest cooking video I've ever seen.  In all honesty, if I hadn't taken a baking class recently, I wouldn't have the slightest idea what she was doing wrong. I'm glad she succeeded at the end.
T'was funny when she Misplaced the dough... Like how?
they are called pain au chocolat though
*pain au chocolat
Why did I hear at the end "ang sarap"?
As a baker, this video gave me cancer
Rie working behind her looking so sweet
My mouth is watering
i have a hugely new appreciation for croissants
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE make a copycat recipe for Panera Bread's  " everything but the kitchen sink "  cookie!
I stan Alex
Is it just me or is watching behind tasty more fun than actual tasty (don’t mind the bad grammar)
Alix could you please make some pastel de natas?
It's just me or in her first time she forgot the butter?
Oh my gosh... -trips, falls, croissants fall, crushed them, cries- OOF BIG OOF.
I love the fact that you are so bubble and 😀
Besides from Rie, Alix is one of the best Tasty producers
Who else loves Alix she’s always making me smile whenever she smiles
Alix is the best
The French would be offended as it's not a true croissant, in France is called chocolates bread
I love this bitch she’s so cute
I swear they’re called pan au chocolat
super cute
I LOVE the whole Tasty crew. They're so cute and charismatic. Plus, you can tell that they actually enjoy what they're doing. I really hope (in the future) they'll show recipes for Vegan croissants.
Rie at the background! :D
I wanna work at tasty just so I can eat all the food they make. Even the "fails".
Rie in the background just doing her thing😂
2:23 lol you can see rie just setting up the station
Why don’t you use a recipe ???
I thought it was a pan u chocolate, cuz I have been calling that my whole life.
#thuglife for alix
Good job!
That looks too hard!!!!
Alix and Rie are my two favorite people from tasty lol
Umm. It actually quakson
2:23 Alix:trying her best at rolling dough Rie: doing stuff smoothly like its nothing  Both good bakers, just at different types of foods
8:05 vs 8:08 aren’t they different?
This girl may be a shit chef but damn she is likeable
I think we can all agree that 1) Alix is a TOTAL QUEEN and 2) her shirt at the beginning says it all.
αм ι тнє σиℓу σиє ωнσ α¢тυαℓℓу ¢αℓℓѕ тнєм "ραιи αυ ¢нσ¢σℓαт"? уєѕ ι ¢σмє fяσм α fяєи¢н ¢αиα∂ιαи вα¢кgяσυи∂ :/
Those are not croissants
alix is seems to be such a great person to have as a friend
Are you going to finish that *c r o i s s a n t ?*
"I don't claim to be a good baker."          -Alix Love you so much Alix!! 💙💙❤
OMG this is not called a "chocolate croissant" but a chocolatine!!!!!!  (On va pas relancer le debat, on sait tous qu on dit chocolatine et pas pain au chocolat! #teamsudouest #teamchocolatine)
Is that really Claire from Bon Appetite😃
Wasn't even worth the struggle because actually, the correct name would be "pain au chocolat".
I love how rie is just minding her own business at 2:25
Literally bend from the dough... or my muscles... probably my muscles
2:32 Rie casually watching Alix struggle to make her croissants
This girl has such a great body
I like this girl
You’re throwing away way too much perfectly edible food just coz it doesn’t look picture/video perfect. Please don’t waste food
7:19 BOSS ASS BI&@H! 🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻
Why didn’t she do the dough lamination until like day 3, and then using softened butter???? Her coworkers should have given her at least that advice
My favorite tasty producer
I love how at tasty dammit is a swear word
It’s a pain au chocolat
Ayee, she’s thick and got the buns too
I rather the behind the scenes ones because they are so much funnier
but congratz
7:19 when u overproud and get embarrace ... speed 1,75× so best view
Alix is full of charm! 😍❤️
*Q U A C K S O N*
its called pain au chocolat though
2:24 Rie looks cute on the backround😍😂
I want a friend that supports me the same way Rie supports Alix at 7:43.
Does it matter on what kind of milk like low fat or not
But you can buy them for so cheap...
“Haha.. I think I’m gonna have a mental breakdown”                  -Alice Traeger
Behind the sences is better that tasty
I love watching her videos
I love Alix's hardwork and personality
Qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm quill asadi
Is it just me or do I call these pain au chocolat?
7:20   *me on the last day of collage*
Onions have layers Ogres have layers Croissants have layers Alex has layers.      UwU
Those are pains au chocolat, not croissants (comum mistake). But still, very impressive!!
*Pain au chocolats
Try making a giant croissant. That'll be a nightmare.
It's a pain au chocolat
Omg she is so pretty
Alix: I've heard this is very very hard, so this will be great.   Lol
it’s not called a chocolate croissant. please call it what it is! it’s pain de chocolat!
Listening to the video at half speed is something else. 😂
Ill have a croissant with a side of Alix.

Who's the chick at 4:39?
I'm super disappointed in the lack of Alex is gorgeous comments Alex you are crazy hot good job champ
Or Paine au chocolats
U mean chocolatines

That croissant has more layers than my hair so be proud
“If you’ve made your own croissants, you can eat them too from having a workout” -Alix 2017
Who else has watched these videos a million times😂😍
Aren’t they pan au chocolate though (probably spelt that wrong)
_Pain au chocolat_
Wow I watched one of Alix’s earlier video. And she has lost tons of weight. Good job Alix❤️❤️❤️
I ❤️ U 💕🇮🇳
I thought I was the only one w struggles making tasy vids
Did anyone see Rie in the bg??
You’re very good at doing the cooking
what do they do to the failed product? throw it away?
6:50 is soo mood 😂
Queen
3:04 Sike you thought 😂
In France we learn this in catering school! Nobody did know how to help you???
“Support your local baker” Lolololol
quackson.
I love how brie is just in the backround
I thought u folded it like in a triangle thing
1:00 girl move to Canada that ain’t a problem...
I tried to do this. Yeah it was not fun....
"Why does my dough look so janky???"  -Alix 2018
Ohhhh! Alix makes me so happy!! 😍😍
Also, the t in croissant is silent
Those aren't called chocolate croissant, they don't even have a croissant shape, it's "chocolatine" or "pain au chocolat"
I think they call that “Pan aù chócolate”
I think they call that “Pan aù chócolate”
I love croissant but i never knew it was this hard to make one
It's not a Chocolate Croissant it's a Chocolatine or a Pain au Chocolat !
To make it a croissant, don't she have to cut it intriangles to create the crescent shape?
you know that’s a pain au chocolat and not a chocolate croissant, right??
I love alexx omg aahahahahhaa
I'd just like to say... Those are called pain au cohocolat not chocolate croissants
It is also known as pan au chocolate    Edit: sorry for being a know it all    The more you know
Why do I love her laugh so much??♥️♥️
Dang ! Round of applause to Woolworths THEY MAKE THEM EVERY DAY!
The first step to baking classic Croissants is to be able to pronounce the name properly (no r).
I love how she walked out of that door with glasses on hahaha
I love her energy ♡
"StooooP i AlmOSt droppEd My crOissAnt"
Ok who was the cute guy
If that was me I would get a croissant and just get a syringe and enter chocolate in... :/
Our local grocery store has really nice chocolate croissants, after watching this I really respect the chef who makes them
Pain au chocolat ou chocolatin ???
0:05 that FACE!
Rie just calmly in the background during the beginning as Alix is suffering 😂
it's not called a chocolate croissant is called pain au chocolat its called in English "chocolate bread"
Yet another great video of this talented lady ruined by the creepy guy at the very end.
Pain au chocolate
Well done Alix!
7:19 nice flash XD
You should go to pairs France.. to try the best
Isn’t kiano an expert at croissant? Could ask her for help
I’m 11 and the first time I made crossiants  they were amazing 😂
I made those in cooking class when i was year 9 and they were easy so watching this, i think i made them wrong lmao
PAIN. AU. CHOCOLAT.  Merci beaucoup au revoir
7:20  What if she fell and all the croissants got ruined.
Bro. I wanna work in Tasty

Id be so fat if i worked there 😂
I just really love Alix... Lol she's so sweet. Lol
Alix reminds me of kat from dance acadamy
The thumbnail has a pain au chocolate
She is like jojo siwa
Still waiting on those cinnamon roll croissants
his shape like the mother of dragons
Pain au chocolat*
Rie in the background
Those are NOT croissants ! The y are called PAIN AU CHOCOLAT !!
Hi Rie!!! 😂
Low key everyone is here to see Alix. No one cares about the croissants 😂😂
0:45 finally😂😂
Pain au chocolat... croissants don't have chocolate
Alix is so beautyfull :3
She reminds me of the skinny version of Trisha Paytas lol
7:17 when I try cooking for the first time and don't set my house on fire.
This is french. AND IN FRENCH IT’S CALLED “PAIN AU CHOCOLAT”.  Chocolate croissant...😭😭
2:31   Rie: Alix what are you even doing?
I like watching Alix make all da desserts she’s cool and everyone too!
Stop I could of dropped my croissant
5:15 the periodic table song 😭
me: cool let’s rewatch this bc it’s relaxing background noise my brain: time to remember ur weird sorta crush on alix
it's called a chocolatine
Is it anyone else’s dream to work at tasty I love to bake it’s my dream to bake everyday
Alix and rie are the best cooks
They aren’t croissants they are pain au chocolat
Rie is the most supportive friend
2:24 in the background like “ there she goes again”.
Alex sound so fake when she talk I hated the video the minute she tried to sound clumsy and funny
Did anyone else see  SHADE SHADE SHADE at like 4:35
So many things are wrong with tasty especially hiring random people who obviously have very limited cooking experience to make dumb cooking videos    I MEAN SHE PUT GRATED BUTTER IN CROISSANTS ......IT DEFEATS THE PURPOSE OF LAMINATION!
Alix: Last Day (hopefully) Me: Ah shit here we go again
What I love about Behind Tasty, is that we might be failing and this makes people more confident that everyone fails
She's so cuteeee and funny 😁
"I don't claim to be a good baker" ~Alix  *insert picture of alix*
She's my favorite! Hilarious....
2:24 rie thooo!!!
I don’t understand why is rie always always with Alex during videos
Girl you need a machine roller like the professionals.
SHE DI NOT USE THE RIGHT INGREDIENTS FOR THE DOUGH
Chocolate croissants 😂😂 it’s pains au chocolat omg
She and Rei is my favorites
She's gorgeous at the end of d show...nd slowly walking ..boom...u nailed it..
If that took her nine days, how long is it gonna take me? 😟
Lmao I lost it when they zoomed in the flour stain in her butt 😂
It's a pain au chocolat Or a "chocolate bread"
it's called "pain au chocolat" or "chocolatin" depending where you are on france
Wow, i should really appreciate my chocolate croissant from now on
is no one gonna tell her those are pain au chocolat’s not ‘chocolate croissants’
Mmmm pain au chocolat!!
😰😄😍🐈🐈🐈🐈🐈🐈🐈🐈🐈🐈
Hi Alex , please give me a shoutout, my YouTube channel is HaiderTEM
It’s a pain au chocolat  This was a great video but omg they called it a chocolate croissant
2:40 'Bent it with my muscles'     *princess ballerina music in background*
I just get it from Panera
I love the comments about it being pain au chocolate and not croissants. I thought her mistake was funny, cause its something a lot of people I know do.
Сome on. If the dough is wet, add some flour. If it's dry or cracking, add some water or milk! No need to throw away a whole batch of dough.
THOSE ARE PAINS AU CHOCOLAT CROISSANTS ARE (like the name says) MOON SHAPED
Scott is in the video
claire!!!
6:58
the handprint had me dead the cameraman moved at the perfect time
I got into a car accident while trying to watch this 🙂
I feel the one who laughed loudly at the beginning when alix made her first mistake😂
Alix really brightens my day !  BUT as a French person I must complain, these are not croissants ! These are pains au chocolat or chocolatines ! Beware if you are heading to France, you will not get what you want from the local baker if you ask for a chocolate croissant (except if what you want is a confused look from a french baker).
I love alex💖💝
Untidy and dirty as fuck
I skipped other Channels when i see Tasty.
Rie in the background was like, "Gudluck sis, I ain't helping you this time" 😂😂😂
That’s not a croissant. That’s a pain au chocolat.
Arent croissants meant  to be shaped liek a cresent like        I am confusion
https://youtu.be/TWB1W0XDfR0
5:10 Claire from Bon Appetit?
As a baker, it's not that bad!
ok, but where can i buy that "so much internet to do" shirt.
Noooooo I know she said it's a chocolatine or something but in France it's actually 'pain au chocolat' not a chocolate crossiant. Merci beaucoup.
I can't be the only one that likes my conment
I'd like to eat her Croissant. <3 Alix
I love her so much she's always so positive she always has a smile on her face this is how many ppl who love her I'm one of them to 👇
Coming to your funeral like: 7:20
Where’s my Québec gang ? Chocolatines !!!
Now i am hungry 😋
I just realized that it’s jungkook focus lol am so stupid😂😂😂😂😂
Did anyone see the bts ad before this video am dying jungkookkkkkkkkkkkk!!!!!!!!,?😍😍😍😍😍😍
JANKY
Am I the only one who wants to work at tasty now????🤣🤣🤣
I am sorry for my self that i wasted 8:42 minutes to watch this video
Like her, I too want an attitude of hardwork and perseverance! Great job Alix!
I love how Rie is just there and watches her struggle at 2:21 😂
Imagine if she dropped the chocolate croissants and had to remake them
She is so funny
Or, you could get croissant dough at the store, put some Nutella in, and bake it. There you have it! Perfect chocolate croissants.
I love the editor who loves to just take the piss out of *everyone*
3:23 is my favourite part. Only because this is exactly how I 'cheer' people up.
eso son napolitanas nena
Pause at 7:20
pain au chocolat*
I wonder how much money they spend a year on ingredients
In french we say Chocolatine in the South-West , In the Extreme north and the Est we say Petit pain au chocolat , in the est we also say Croissant au chocolat and the rest of the france says Pain au chocolat
She lost the dough
The croissants look good
Alix is thicc no lie
Lol if you had a movie night with these guys you wouldn't even need to order anything, they can make pizza, snacks etc.
I want Alex to be my older sister
Whoever edited it definitely has a good sense of humor
Who else sees rie in the background
2:20 that’s what she said
Nobody: ........ Tom holland: qUaHsoHhN
I'm eating one right now... 😂
Alex is super cute if you agree hit like  👇🏻 👇🏻 👇🏻
4:30 supervising from mom of Tasty Rie
Kwa-son 👍😘
*The new skinny legend*
I think there called pain aux chocolat
Pain au Chocola and not Chocolat Croissants
Of course the fat lady makes these recipes
What is your location I need them croissants.
They are really similar 2 napolitanas 😐🤔
Imagine how Starbucks workers feel?
And this is way I always get pre-made dough
these are actually “pain au chocolat” or “chocolatine” or “petit pain”, depending of the department you live in  croissants are the pointy ones!!!!🥐
*WE WANT A GIANT CHOCOLATE CROISSANT!*
i love how everyone who sees her is like 'wow ur making croissants? that sucks lol'
*paîn au chocolat
Pain au chocolat
The grated butter looks like maggots🤮
When you go to France and then you ask a person for some direction and he replies with “WHERS MY CROISSANTS 🥐”
Those are pain au chocolats
She’s my favorite , I love Alex 😂🙈💛
7:27 Ok, she's weebing out.
Aren't they called pain au chocolats
Hi
Can we just talk about Rie low key overseeing Alix. Tiger mom style haha
5:24
You need to cut them like triangles to make them look original or they look like brioches
Isn't this 'pain de chocolat'?
2:15 WTF
1:29  Skyrim relations Adrianne didn't claim to be the best blacksmith in Whiterun but Eorland's steel is pretty fricking far from legendary
She's always smiling and positive. :)
CHOCOLATE CROISSANT IS NOT A THING, IT IS A PAIN AU CHOCOLAT, THANK U
She’s stunning
I just can't stop looking at the flour handprint on Alix's butt. I'm sorry XD
Isn't 5:12 to 5:40 the periodic table song  by ASAP science?
5:24 awww Hannah’s so cute
How you look in the video How it looks in real life 😂🤣
I hope i can meet girl like alex.... She so beuty n alwys happy... He nvr give up on smthng. . Btw the food yum2... Delicious
Who else is annoyed that called pan au chocolat croissants, the French will kill u
Day 3? Attempt 4?  Hotel? Trivago.
I love thicc chiccs!
Throughout this video I thought “It’s a pana chocolat”
5:10 Claire from Bon Appètit
1:34  look at that then go 10 seconds back 😂😂
Alex is my fravirite of alllllllll!!!!!!!
Those are not croissants. In france "pain au chocolate" in italy "napoletana" in spain "napolitana"
I would call those Pain au Chocolat's
Its not even croissants. Its pain au chocolat.0
it sounded graduation after 7:17
Alix: bent from the dough, or my muscles  Haters: what muscles all I see is fat  Me: GO GIRL! I SEE YOU
She’s hot
You are so lovely!!!! 😍❤
I love this woman so much 😭😭😍😍
My favorite! 🤗😍😊😘
Alix: hi guys I’m Alix I’m a tasty producer   YouTube captions:hi guys I’m Alex I’m a TC producer   Alix : am I a joke to you

5:35  *started makin' it* *had a break down* *BON APETIT* -James Acaster

Claire on tasty
It's called a pan au chocolate, you uncultured swine
7:19 like a pro !!
She is my favourite tasty producer !! She is cute, funny and very talented !! <3
at 7:23 what if she tripped
I thought you don’t know how to write croissant. Because the thumbnail text had “...”
why does Alix remind me of a more happy, cheerful, and confident Morgan Adams?
"STOP IT! UR GONNA DROP MY CROISSANTS!!"
Did anyone else see Rie behind her???
OMFG they’re fucking called pain au chocolat
I really like how happy she is when she cooks ❤ I wonder what's her IG accnt so i can follow her ☺
I keep on coming back to this video i’ve watched it like a thousand times
rie in the background being productive and looks at disapppointment
pain au chocolat or chocolatine thx, not "CHOCOLATE CROISSANTS" a chocolate croissant is a croissant with chocolate in it. it must have the shape of a crescent. period.  jveux juste la paix ici
no offence i can bake and i'm  only 11 years old. but never GIVE UP
"And I'm a tasty producer"-alex 2017- 2019🤣
This is pain au chocolat not croissant im french ...
i love how tastys ad are about themselves
But... that is not a croissant...  Also: I *_still_* think she is *_not_* funny at all. She just tries waaay to hard to be funny and that us just... _annoying_
Pain eau chocolàt
I just wince each she says croissants
This triggered me, it's not a chocolate croissant but a pain au chocolat  Edit : didn't mean to sound so aggressive in the comment, sorry  guys <3
ITS PAIN AU CHOCOLAT
Best statement yet: "Support your local Baker." Lol 😂😂
Actually when I made it for the first time it was really good so I will make it again.
You should have put the cutting board in the freezer to keep it cold
When ur from the UK and everyone you know calls them pain au chocolats
Idc Bruh She Bad Af
7:33 I knew this would happen
Alex and Alix.. (Alex French Guy cooking)
I’m in love
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH 7:49 falls LMAO! Great job
5:54 Is it wrong that I thought this was *IKEA*   For a second... ;-;
7:20 she had sunglasses inside
3:31 identical to   Kaley Cuoco
But you didn't teach anything.
Croissants are sooo hard. So delicious yet so difficult. Who else  thinks that most delicious and tasty things take effort and are hard?
There actually called pain au chocolat
8:07 it looks like croissants with dog poop coming out 😂😂😂
Im glad ronda rousey is now cooking
2:17 camera man is horny
Do you mean pain o chocolat
I just put Nutella in the pillsbury crescents before I roll them up and they are so good
Wait aren't chocolate croissants called 'pain au chocolat'
I love these behind the tasty videos because we could see the struggle of them making and it makes us feel better 😂
Sorry, not enough chocolate. **Dumps croissant in melted chocolate** Much better
But she is a good baker
She needs toput more milk
Are you gonna finish that croissant?
Chocolate Kwah-son
Her God gave her beauty and good personality and an annoying voice to balance
I trust Rie with my life
I actually made this from the tasty app and wow they tasted so good! But yes, it is a very long process 😅😅 but worth it!
Alix: **pulls the tray away from the table**  Alix: **looks awkwardly at the camera** Alix: **dances** Me: 😂 😂
Dat ass

Hey alix, can you make your own version of Porto’s cheese roll pls
PAIN AU CHOCOLAT DAMN IT  By the way love this video

Alix has my heart
Behind Tasty Scyth_Mist* Version!   Go to Sainsbury’s and get a croissant,  Next, buy a dairy milk.  Finally, shove the chocolate bar in the middle of it and you have....  The Scyth_Mist* Insanely tricky homemade ish croissant
they are called pain au chocolat,  is it an American thing to call them chocolate croissants?
Why did she kept looking up
"I don't claim to be a good baker" -Alix 2017
It’s a pain au chocolat, you’re supposed to be a chef 😂 how do you not know the difference

She's cute
I love that Rie is just chilling in the background watching her struggle with the dough 😂😂
What is Rie doing in the background?
Was that Claire??
2:23, Rie at the background
Anyone else notice 5:01 the music in the background is the same music for the periodic table song 😂

CHOCO CORRONET
This is chocolatine

When I ever watched her video she reminds me of trisya paytas, i hope I spelled her name right
SANNES

Those are called pains au chocolat, which means... Chocolate... b r e a d ?
I made this recipe a while ago. U made it look so easy in the video that I was like no big deal. Well let me tell u I was so WRONG!!!! This recipe was so hard and I had never made or had a chocolate croissant again for over a year now! Made me feel really good to know that u did the recipe like 9 times thou.
Imagen she slips on butter and then the croissants lands in the in when she finally made the perfect one
boii alix is thiccc
7:19 shit I'm dirty minded.
She's very cheerful and great and I love she keeps trying *but what about the flipping food she's making EVERY.  SINGLE. MISTAKE*
OMG I pressed on this tasty video and there was a tasty ad OH MAH GAWSH
Omg i cant velieve your allowed to wear that black "dress?" To work

My mom doesn't like Alix

"I don't claim to be a good baker."  - Alix
These guys have enough food in the fridges to end world hunger
The thing I learned in this vid is that Alix has muscles
primo eso es una napolitana de toda la vida no me jodas
Beautiful 10/10, funny 10/10, pastry chef 9/10 :-)
This doesn't inspire any confidence in following their directions lol
does anyone see rie in the back cleaning at 3:08
That constant mispronunciation of "croissants" made this unwatchable for me.
hAY You ALmOSt DrOpEd My cRoiSsANt!
She’s my genuine favorite to watch ❤️
They’re called pain au chocolat you uncultured swine
I'm sorry but those are not called "croissant" but "pain au chocolat" which basicly means chocolate bred 😊
Aren’t they called panochocolas or is that just English for you?
Can i work there please.

Why do Americans pronounce croissants like that 😅😂lol it’s cool
I SMELL PENNIES

4:43 He cute or whateveer👅
Does anyone else here watch French Guy Cooking? She could have used some tips from his video XD
Us franchise are quaking over the fact that she calls “pain au chocolate “ “chocolate croissants “
They bleeped out goddamn it like why tho
I made it for the first time and it can't be better thanks <3
How to make chocolate croissants step1.get a croissant 🥐 from the supermarket step2.get chocolate sauce and put it in the croissant Finished
Oh ya I just lost the dough in the 50 fridges that are in this kitchen
She is thicc af holyshit 😍😍😂
The girl who telling her never again to made croissant at 3:25 is soo cute
I wonder what Rie is making behind her in the beginning of the video?🤔
4:03 someone check her wrist and the thing she just said
"I don't claim to be a good baker ". - Alix 2017
All that work so some woman on Facebook named Cheryl could be like “that is NOT a French croissant!!!!!!!!! 😡”
Do you mean pain au chocolat?
I speak french and those are pains au chocolat and no croissants.....
Rie cleaning at the side is joy lol
Where is the girl with hot voice
3:24 that motivation tho 😂😂😂
She's so Quirky 😂 love her 😍
6:56 she's the absolute cutest
She is so lovely ❤️
Eating pain au chocolat gives me pain
The sound of it when she takes a bite was so satisfying....
Hmmm yes
ppl kept correcting saying i's pain au chocolat when literally non french ppl don't care hahaha but thanks for informing us
I feel like this is one thing that I really need to master before I go to culinary school and this is the reason why I watch these video they are very entertaining to watch
It’s a pain au chocolat
Sorry I’m chocoLATE he he...
2:32 the look on Rie's face though! 😂😂
Oooooh look at all those layers     *Damn*
It is nearly Christmas who cares
Please do more Behind Tasty with Alix
I *live* for alix’s personality
In france we say chocolatine for this « chocolate croissant »
GO QUEEN
‘Uno crossiants take 3 days right?’ Had me creasing😂🤣
This channel teaches us that you will succeed if you just never give up and keep trying
omg it looks soooo good   /(^_^)\
she didn’t put the butter or cut it into a triangle the first “successful” time
Thiccc af. I can only wish my croissant Baker is this hot.
i love your voice..
It’s called a pain au chocolat🤬
Its called a Pain au Chocolat or a Chocolatine
She reminds me of my little sister always positive,cheerful,smiley and laughs at her mistakes plus she's funny as well
7:19 the La Gazza Ladra Overture 😂
Your luckyyyyy
This video really buttered my croissant
I love u guys so much and I hope u will enjoy your time with your family and friends in your family day out love you miss you so much plz can you please tell me what is going on with you today

Giant raindrop still my fav
5:26. 0.25x.. Have fun!
5:11 come through Claire BA 🙌🏽🙌🏽
It’s called “pain au chocolat "
Alix should make a video on finding alternative ways on rolling out croissants. I'm thinking a steamroller?
I always wonder what she does after she puts something in the fridge to let it sit until the next day
Pause at 7:19 thank me later
Damn she thicc
Alex you r the bestttttttttttttttt!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Reminds me of start of a pie dough
Omg these are called Paine chocola
8:05 to 8:15 it’s not the same croissants😂
Who else saw rie in the back round? I love rie!!
if only I could taste ur food man...
I love rie!!!!
Hi guys i’m alix i’m a tasty producer i’m fat and i have fat hanging off my chest which is why my boobs are large and i have no cleavage and i’m a woman so fuck myself and i look bad in lipstick       it bended from the dough, or my muscles, probably my fat ass.
Lol breadstick
Moral of the story is. Go to Fournos
I was laughing the whole time. I see my own struggles.😂😂
I hate when people call it chocolate crossiants it’s a fricking PAIN AU CHOCOLAT
It took that one fish 3 days to make that potato salad
She has THE perfect body. I love her personality. I would date her.
They're actually pain au chocolat/chocolatine
Can I just mention how at 2:23 Rie is just casually doing her thing
ugh tell me that’s i ear wrong what’s a chocolate croissant?¿? it doesn’t even exist in france. plz american stop it’s a bread’s chocolate
Yum
she looks soooo pretty w French braids
It's not c02... It's steam. Much love and congrats on the croissant!
i'm sorry, but i already gave up on everything
I screamed for a while when I tried to bake these..
Idk anyone who looks up that much when they’re baking 🤣 Also, if you pound the butter into a sheet and then start the lamination it works better (at least for me it does).
i saw rie in the background, the video is now complete
Alix ... beautiful .
You are my fav😊
You know in the beginning that it was hard because of all the different outfits she was wearing in the intro😂
i find that "OHH YESS " in the end of every tasty video to be super HOT !!!
I always think croissant is fat and made by butter before i buy haha
When I’m older if tasty is still a thing I would love to work there
Making croissants isn't that hard. I am 14 and I  tried it. They turned out fantastic from my first attempt even though I am not a professional chef 😂
I feel like all the people at tasty every time they see her struggle at COOKING they are like “what the hell is she doing here?”
guys, it's not a chocolate croissant, it's a "pain au chocolat". sorry, french girl speaking here :p
If anyone tries making this, you can hit the dough with the rolling pin to spread it, is way easier.
She’s annoying 🙄
Fingerprints 😍      But i love chocolate croissants more 😋😁
I lover her ND rie❣️
7:19 *Me when I got A's in all Test*
Not trying to be a “technical person” but  traditionally they are called pain au chocolad ❤️❤️❤️😂😂😂 love you
alix is full of happines!!!!!
It is called "pain au chocolat" and some people are calling this "chocolatine" in the south of France :)
They called THAT chocolate croissants??? Croissants??!!!!! XD
They aren't called chocolate crossaints it's called pain au chocolat
ALIX IS MY FAVE
CLAIRE FROM BA.... Wait a minute....
I think those are pan au chocola but I'm only a GCSE student and don't have a lot of experience with pastry dough so....
Dutch Hust hust deutsch #
They are called Chocolatines, learn the lingo ladies! haha Well that's what they are called in Montreal (I'm French)

She got a fat ass
7:20 Alex just I'm the queen move out hot queen here lol XD
Alix is literally the prettiest human
I don't understand the point of these "bake" attempts, Is it meant to be funny?
did someone see her panties too?
Is nobody gonna talk abt the fact that the music at 5:18 is from the periodic table song? ... Obv not i am the nerd here
I made croissants in Culinary school... have not made them since. They are a PAIN in the butt. As shown here, lol.
略人 㞨湒䔵尸 汞 莐
I like her already
She's waisting ingredients
Is it just me who is watching this video the 7th time?

The are not chocolate croissants!!! It's pain au chocolat, bread with chocolate!!
She’s cute😍
Alix:Ok,it's a little hard Me: *ThATs WHaT ShE SaiD!!!*
7:36 oooooof
4:33 rie lol
"Hi I'm Alix and I'm a *tasty* producer" She should've said : "Hi I'm Alix and I'm a producer at *tasty* " It sounds better 😂 because "I'm a tasty producer sounds like she's saying that *she* is tasty 😂😂 ok I'll stop .
high key want a tour of the tasty shooting space
cinnamon flavored croissants aren't a bad idea
IS THAT CLAIRE FROM BA ON FACETIME WTF I DIDNT KNOW SHE WAS APART OF BUZZFEED
Alix that may be a little over dramatic but its funny so bravo
She reminds me of Emilia Clarke
It’s not chocolate croissant but  petit pain au chocolat
3:41 what’s the name of the guy wearing blue shirt at the back? He’s cute. 🙂
The name should be "Hard to make chocolate croissants"   Why cant ya just buy pre made croissant dough then SHUVE A BUNCH OF CHOCOLATE INSIDE THEN BAKE IT
Is it just me or does Alix kind of look like Lily from clever 😂        No just me ...... ok 🤦‍♀️ 😂
wAIT AMERICANS GENUINELY CALL THEM CHOCOLATE CROISSANTS?!?! THEIR  PAN AU CHOCOLA  ARE ACTUALLY CALLED CHOCOLATE CROISSANTS?!??!?!??!?
Who loves Michael Jackson?
what I learnt from this video is, there is a reason why bread is called "pain" in french.
She's the hottest creature God has ever created! <3
4:55 Alix regreting her life decisions
I realize (as a french person) that american call "Pain au chocolat" Chocolate Croissants ?
Her attitude is just like her fat ass and most of us love that
I made chocolate crossiants and I'm 10 and it was soooooo tasty
* AHHH ! Stop, I could of dropped my croissants *
2:32 Rie all like that’s not even hard
Can u guys bring Rosana pansino
You know it took awhile when the montage video has a montage in it
" I dont claim to be a good baker.
"I misplaced the dough" 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Cresonts are like ogres they both have layers
suuuuuuuuuuper positive love her
Rie throwing shade was a mood
You should try to make all different types of mochi! Like so she can seeeeeee!!!!!
She has a channel named alix and her last name
oh yeah yeah
They're pain au chocolat not 'chocolate croissants' BTW ILYSM
2:31 Rie literally just lift the microwave with only two hands. I guess I'm just so weak lol
*"I don't claim to be a good baker"*                    Alix 2017
Not to be rude. Is she pregnant? She looks a little... thicker than usual...
I have ones made croissants and i am 13
Marry me ❤️🙏🏻
Oh my poor girl 😂
2:32  *Did Rie just carry a whole microwave???*
She is pronouncing it wrong...
Rie at the background be like “Ima eat that croissant after , but i am not going to help 🤪🤣😂
@4:34 Rie shading Alix in a subtle way like the master that she is.  Hahaha gosh I love these two!!!
IS THAT TAMRA CHAMBERS
I love her
Trick for making chocolate croissant: refrigerate the bowl before making the dought, it will give you more time to make the dough.
any one getting clarke from the 100 vibes when she put on the sunglasses??😂😂
Those are not crossants jesus where my french people at PAIN AU CHOCOLAT
Shes in her main habitat
These are not croissants! But if you meet two different french persons, don't ask them how they're called or it might get dangerous.
Rie in the background doing whatever she wants
2:22 is the best part of the video; rie’s in the background
Lovely alex recipes is beautifull💚😊
2:23 rie in the back ground
She's a cutie and so funny 😘
Who all thinks that alexi and Brenda are the tasty kids and alexis and ria are the mothers?no one?ok just me

Cinnamon roll crossiants?!....get on that shit
...And flour your ass
They're called pain au choclat in UK
does anyone wonder how many food or ingredients they waste/use?
i cried for her !
Pain au chocolate
I love that Rie was walking around in the back and not saying anything about that she was doing
There called pana chocalate
She is stunningly adorable.
Its like they do it wrong on purpose a few times just for the sake of the video, this time it was obvious. No recipe will tell you to do it the way she did the first 3(?) times.
They are actually Called pan au chocolat
8:13 support your local baker XD
I love her!!!
2:23 REI!! 💓  Edit: 4:30 REI AGAIN! I JUST LOVE HER💓

Congrats!!
Is it just me or does anyone else think she's very tasty

She is a tasty (means yummy)produce???
They're not chocolate croissants. They're pains au chocolat.
I love how Rie was laughing in the background 😂
Every dish you look so tasty
I'm not 100% sure but I think they're called pan au chocolat not chocolat croissant x
5:35 *me*
There're not called chocolate croissants, there're called pain au chocolat .
Alix, you are adorable! I love watching you try, try and keep smiling until you succeed!
8:41 she got floure on her butt😂
I once found a recipe for croissants online and wa slike 'let me copy this to my recipe book' by the time I finished writinf down the recipe I wrote a last note to myself 'NEVER EVER MAKE. GO TO THE STORE' 😂
Finally i found my blonde twin 😂😆
Alix ( 2:27 )- its hard im not exaggerating rn Rie ( 2:32 ) - lifts a whole microwave in background  😂😂😂😂
I am 13 and I want to marry her  She has a beautiful features and a beautiful personality love her
Tasty! 😊
I made those with the recipe they were fairly easy so good job Alix :D
I made these...took forever...my forearms hurt like a bitch...they’re really really delicious though!!!

Please please please STOP calling it a "chocolate croissant " its à PAIN AU CHOCOLAT I mean That s how We call it in France
Pls pray for me im an amateur baker i love baking and im going to make this today and after watching this i dont think i can make these😢oh god (im just 15)
Its called Pain au chocolat dammit!
I wish I live in America to have a chance to date her.
Shes the best and she is really funny
Those ain't chocolate croissants those are pain au chocolat two different things
I think they're called: pain au chocalats, but ok :|
Is she for real?
the way she says croissants kills me inside
Love you smile
It’s pain aux chocolat not chocolate croissant
It seems so good to be Tasty's crew 😎
SUPPORT YOU LOCAL BAKER HAHAHAHAHAHA this is hilarious
Freeze your butter for a few minutes and then grate your butter. It doesn't melt down as quickly as the butter you left out to soften for a bit.
Now I LOVE HER 😍🙈 Gaaaaahd alix  stop being adorable. 😁 SHE'S MY ULTIMATE CRUSH IN TASTY STAFF🙈
7:52 Jojo Siwa?
I always lose my food when im making something
I would totally smash
My homemade version:   Buy a chocolate bar  Buy a plain croissant   Put a chocolate bar inside and in the middle of the croissant   Done. ✅
They’re called Pain au Chocolat but okay
Alix is so adorable!@!
7:23 to 7:24 was soooooooooo extra
its pam chocolat
Watching this video like a billion times alredy and just realize that what she made are not even croissants...
7:22 that hair flip was everything 😂
But Meryl Streep makes it look so easy
2:26 rie is in the back ground
Pains au chocolats.
C'est chocolatine putain
3:31 Alix sounds so CUTE!!
Alix looks a bit like Hailee Steinfeld.
I can watch Alix all day. Sooooo cute
Her smile and personality are infectious!
Quackson?
she’s happy I’m happy
...Better do a salad...
oh just realised the bg song is of asap science the periodic table song
How can you mess this up
Why am I  liking her
That's not a chocolat croissant 😢 that's a "pain au chocolat"
Alex is my favorite shhhhhhh

They are not croissant ,in france a croissant with chocolate its called pain au chocolat,apart from that great video!!!
She’s too adorable ❤️

I literally love her! Her personality is awesome and she’s so fun to watch!
I like how she smiles all the time, her happiness is contagious. She’s the best! I always have a great time watching her. Please, we need more videos with her! Omg ❤️
Is it just me or is Alex really pretty.
She is wife material at its finest, ladies take notes
I want to know where she got that dress! It looks so good on you!!
OMG you sooooo funny I like gurl I Tried to not laugh but I couldn’t 🤣🤣🤣💔👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻💪🏻💪🏻 well at least it looked perfect yaaaah
I just starting watching these and she is so cute funny etc. But for me she needs to maybe take it down a little. She is too wired I am sorry to say that because she is so likable but watching makes me want to give her a pill to relax not a lot just a little.
Ok, let's make this clear, these are called "Pain au chocolat" not chocolate croissant- sorry I'm French.
Excuse me but as a french person it is not a "chocolate croissant" it is a " pain au chocolat" this is offensive lile if your gonna make it  call it the proper thing there is a big difference
Tasty should hire me because i know how to on the microwave and then veg. Hot noodles in it....
7:19 WASSUP BITCHEEEEEESSSSS  In all seriousness I like how she's so cheerful and at the brink of breaking down at the same time
Its called Pain au Chocolat
In England we call them by the French name, pain au chocolat
_Rie silently doing work in the background_
I love how upbeat Alix always is. She makes me super happy
I thought they were called pain un chocolate
Alix is literally my favorite person cause she always so smiley and has a wonderful sense of humor 💖

Or is this the how not to make a croissant - or 100 ways u get a croissant wrong ? 😂 but love the way it was presented kudos 🌝
Alex is soo funny haha

I thought it was alex but is alix wtf
Alix is really hot
Literally watch these for Alix she’s so damn beautiful and thiccc I love her

That walk of triumph was epic!!!
I love her so much
"Stahp! I almost dropped my chrissont!"
she so likeable!
Omg she is so fun to watch she literally makes my dayyyy❤️ KEEP GOING!

*Remembers a vine*        "Staaaahp i couldve dropped my croissant!!"
I’m pretty sure they are pain au choclat
She's so cute! She reminds of my Cousin sis. 💖💖
That whole start said "this is not croissant" grating butter
OMG THEY ARE CALLED PAIN AU CHOCOLAT ( in French from France) OR CHOCOLATINE ( in French from Québec)
She is hot
Rie watching Alex in the background is killing me
Who saw die in the background like if you did
Actually i enjoy your failure more than the success, coz you accept it with so much of humor, love you
*pain au chocola
Never eat stuff made by a person wearing sleeveless top... Yuck
1:34 my dear you're the best <3 HAHA
Remember the meme Stop im gonna drop mahhh croissant!
Alex is beautiful ❤
I have so much more respect for Starbucks chocolate croissants now
I really like her ... she's so sweet
Crush of Dec' 18 is now officially Alex!
how can she be fat and sexy at the same time??
Man I saw Rie behind you
It's pain au chocolat not croissaint! Chocolate croissaint is folded differently...
4:08 that thing in the background 😦        Ik it was just a guy in the jacket it just looks creepy
Yay for Alix
Y'all don't understand how often I watched this video
Needs more chocolate. A lot more chocolate. You can never have too much chocolate.
that was such a great entrance until she tripped
"I Am Not A Good Baker" - Alix
I . love. alix.
rie: moves a whole ass microwave like it's nothing me: weird flex but ok
I love every thing to do with this woman. 😍😍 Personality to die for. I would love being your friend!! "I uh... Ate half of this bar last night" 🤣 she needs to make her own "Nailed It" cooking show!!
They're not chocolate croissants, they're actually called pain au chocolat.
Just go to Panera and ask for a chocolate pastry book your done
pain au chocolat merde! je suis prete a meme dire chocolatine si necessaire, mais pas croissants au chocolat lmaoo
She looks a lot like Emilia Clarke.
When she came out with her freshly baked croissants wearing sunglasses I completely lost it! Ugh i love her!!!! 😍😍😍
I thought they were called pain au chocolats?
Alix *waks with rolling pin*  WHY IS IT BREAKING!
STOP! I coulda dropped my croissant.
I'm going to throw up that's way too much butter
She is so sweet!!!!
you just see rie in the back at 2:23 like “gosh alix you suck” lol
Soooo...are these videos "dares"?  "I'll bet you can't make croissants without a recipe!"  Fairly pointless until the couple minutes.
those aren't croissants
The trick is to put the pound of butter in the center of the dough and then roll it and re-roll it several times
I wish she was my best friend😂
When is tasty gonna do a whole page on gluten free😩😩😩
Rieeeeee 😍😍😍😍
cinnamon roll croissants already exist, they're called "franzbrötchen".
Respect ✊🏼
Pain of chocolat for gods sake
She  is so beautiful
Isn't this more like  pain au chocolat ?
The way she speaking is so so cute 😊😊
2:21 That’s what she said 😏        (If you know what I mean)
I admit, I'm a little sad to see how it turned out because I've always used the flat butter rectangle method too.  However, when I saw her grating the butter, that just looked so much easier and I badly wanted that method to somehow work even though it intuitively didn't make sense.
Ogres are like croissants...they have layers. . .
Chocolate croissants are my favorite
I want to work here
Ogres are like croissants they both have layers
I got a tasty ad..
7:19   am i blind😎😎😎
My mom makes chocolate croissants all the time.... it isn’t that tricky. I don’t get why everyone is saying it’s so hard!
I ever knew Rei worked at tasty for a yr now
I don’t claim to be a good baker
eso no son croissants, son napolitanas
You are cute😍😍 I found you adorable 💓💓
Does anyone else not like the square footage?
Croissants is one of my favourite thing to do, you have to make sure your butter doesnt melt so you have to chill after every fold
2:22 Surprise Rie!
The last batch looks Great 👍, but they are called chocolatines (pronounced with a French accent)
"I learned support your local baker" 😂😂😂😂😂😂
The words ok-est Hannah is looking for you
They're called pain au chocolat
Your so beautiful and cute  that Croissant also 😊❤️
Omg I love Alix 🥰
At 7:18 She's soooo extra I can't😂
I'm kind of curious, if they needed to keep the dough cool, could they not have cooled or frozen the marble slab? (To bypass having to put it into the fridge after a few folds?) Then added the step into the final video.
Wtf she is so pretty 😍
Alex should make a GIANT chocolate croissant 🥐🥐🥐
I wanna mmmmm alex so bad. shes so beautiful!
rie in the background 3nickpoinvek
There is a lot a recepies like this, there food has to be super chilled, and I always wonder how they made in ancient times? Because this recepies are not new, and there were no fridges back then...
7:19 Panties!
Alix is so adorable at 6:58
Alixa you are a very good baker
BAM SHE TRIPS oops
She is the perfect woman she cooks she has a good job she is beautiful her personality is amazing i like how she always keeps a good vibe ughh i want her sooo bad 😍😍😍😍
I can’t stop watching this so many times I also love the part where she keeps Messing up at the beginning XD
rie in the back like🤨
Is Alix anyone else’s favorite? 😂
Alix should have her own YouTube channel.😁🎥 Like if u agree👍🏼
She is adorable omg
I bet she is a tasty producer
thicc
Why does she keeps on looking up? Im so distracted 😂
Love u alex
A shortcut that I use is after rolling out the dough, I will cover the dough with the shredded butter(basically 1/2 of a stick at a time; book it; wrap it and chill for at least 40 mins repeating the process until all the butter required used, then place in the fridge until chilled again, at least and hour. Then roll out the dough, booking it, repeat until you get the amount of layers that you want. If you have a hot kitchen like theirs, place a plate containing ice on the counter or table that you are using to roll out the dough(or the board she was using). I use the same method to make biscuits and I get those nice flakey layers. Also it is steam that the melted butter produces not CO2 which is Carbon Dioxide.
90% of the video is just smiling. She is so bubbly and likeable
Thats so me. Walking so cool and feeling so accomplished, but then I trip and almost ruin it. The story of my life
What u mean is hard. All u do is buy so croissants at costco and cut the croissant in half put chocolate on the middle and microwave it. Boom chocolate croissants.
@2:23 u cant unsee rie minding her own business while alex is suffering 😂😂😂😂😂
That chinese girl looks like she has a bad attitude. This is another waste of food. So wasteful
She is a fine example of positivity and yes continue to support your local bakery because those look hard af
5.47-5.59 *Literally me trying to find my glasses*
I love the way u talk on the show..actually i lov ur voice...n one more thing..i jus lov the way ur messy wen cooking..u hav fun while cooking i lov that
I jus lov u alex...
Rie is cooking in the background
I would laugh so hard if she dropped the final croissonts like so hard
Who needs the gym? When you can just try and make croissonts New ad 2018
Pause at 2:18 😂😂😂😂 flour on her butt 😂 omg I lover her now 😂😂😂
Kwasonts?!
wish she wasn't so fake
Alex is soooooo adooooorable 😚😚😚
She just won my heart with her positively, bubbly personality, and her silliness lol 😄.
please post more behind tasty with alix
I see rie!
Alix walking out in shades and her hair out VS my gay ass having a heart attack
Shes so cute. I love her personality. Wn u see alex u think there is no greif or sorrows In the world. Happiness everywhere😊
Pause at 3:33
it is a pain au chocola
2:31 Rie just like “Wtf is she doing”
It's like she didn't research how to make croissants beforehand and then tried to make them. also butter does not turn into CO2 it creates steam which acts as the leavener. Love her attitude though! maybe they purposefully chose this format so others wont make the same mistakes.
1 Bonus point for this vid: Rieeeeeeeeeee
I wish I work in buzzfeed or tasty when I grow up it seems like the best work place ever
what a beautiful looking women
8:14 when I get 60 percent on my quiz replace layers with grades
Tasty what happened to cinnamon roll croissants xD
Rei with that shade
If you pause at 1:14 it looks like she’s grating soap
I got a tasty ad before this tasty video
That's a pain au chocolat  not a coussaint
I would love to cut their clips! Must be sooo fun!
Alix:"Not happy!!" *smiles*
Erm it’s called a pano chocolaté
7:20 ???
2:00 - 2:23 I was watching Alex at 2:00 than I saw Rei and saw wht are their differences ..... Alex: having a hard time in making these sences , Rei: oh look this looks soo easy I have no problem here on my side not like Alex....
They look tasty and the video is top.  But please it's named "pain au chocolat" not croissant.
chocolate quackson
There is no possible way Alix could be any cuter. For real...all the cuteness hurts my heart a little. 😍
5:34 mood
You Americans! It's is pronounced pan u shocola 😇
It’s called a pain au chocolat idiot
Me
They are called pain eu chocolate not chocolate croissants
Did Rhea just lift that microwave oven like its nothing!!!!
That's not chocolate croissant but "pain au chocolat"
Its called ‘’pain au chocolat’’
......pain au chocolat......
She is cute💕
She is legit a more hilarious version of Clarke from the 100. Love it XD
Gurl, these ain't no cruasants.
I’m pretty sure they are called ‘pain o’chocolate
2:22 Rie is in the background
These are pan au Chocolat, croissant refers to the shape not the pastry itself. Tasty are kind of awful with food like with the birds eye videos, there's so much more to cooking the right way than what they show.
She looks like Ronda Rousey circa 3 months after her 1st loss
7:34 - 7:36... "who wants lasagna?" lol
i loved it!
i didn't know it's that much of a deal my sister makes it all the time
Lmfao, Alex is her own Party 😂😂😂😂
Those look awesome!
this is the video that made all of us fall in love with alix
It’s called chocolatine
I wish Alix went to my school I love her!
2:22 Rei!!!!
when you make something you first have to study 🤷🏼‍♀️ croissant: dont just put the butter in to the dough you want ist to melt between layers so you have to put it on the dough and then fold like dragon beard candy. you are going to have thousend layers with butter in between so thats were the layers come from its not magic 🤷🏼‍♀️ good job though and 👍 for not giving up 🤗
I love how rie is just doing her thing in the background 😂😂
Support Your Local Baker!!
if by design you are spreading butter to make croissants it's already way too warm. like the reason it took so long is because she didn't even google how to make croissants beforehand, the incredibly simple rule is to keep it cold and have nearly frozen butter.
So thick.
ALIX IS THE BEST
Butter dosent create co2...
I don’t know how Starbucks does it
I’m always laughing watching these😂😂😂 She is hilarious AND beautiful
idk why but i love watching her shes sooooooo funny!!!
I’m in love with that women
Alix - I'm having a mental breakdown... Me - Awwwwwww she's so cute
Can we tlk about them layers u kickn alix? I need sum alix layers in my life ❤❤❤
I feel really good about myself now because I tried once and I'm 13 and they were amazing 😉😂
4:11
Hi Alex I love you! ❤️♾🙂
*sees Rie*  *instantly likes video*
And then there’s Rie quietly working in the background
big ass......ignment i hate it
They're pain au chocolat, not chocolate croissants. Croissants are completely different things.
How to make chocolate croissants:    Buy some pre-made croissants from the store(Ya know,the ones in the can that you have to bang on the counter to open.) Put croissants on pan with some sort of something underneath of it. Spread Nutella on croissants before you roll them up. Bake croissants. EAT DELICIOUSNESS.
2:23 Rie was in the background you could’ve asked her she is the queen of tasty
Where is you're diamond play button
"Im a tasty producer"
"You really gonna have a Mental break down"The hell Alex your still Smiling😂😂
Do you guys work for 5 minuet craft
Alix I rather buy them after watching this video! 💕😋👏🏼
7:35 2 seconds before disaster
"support your local baker"
2:17 HMMMMMMMMMMM...
She should've watched the Tasty video first on how to make the croissant before making one.
I miss those kind of videos.
She showed panties
I love this video even though it’s just a good video it’s shows how you should not give up and always keep a positive attitude. Even though people told her they wouldn’t dare she didn’t give up this video was actually very inspiring
7:25 drops them
that's not how you make croissanits...
Alix be struggling and Rie just cooking in the back.  I love everyone's shade.  Rie: *picks up microwave.*  Alix: *cant roll out dough.*
Rie's calmy washing the dishes in the distance...
She’s my fave type of hooman
Sis that shit is garbage!
It's "pain au chocolat" or"chocolatine"
Support ur local baker ROFL love these vids, gives me courage to fail! lol
I want to be your child. Then i can get good food everyday
You can see she's all in tasty things...
She's so hot!beautiful!!!😍😍😍
That's a million  dollar smile she's got
She seems like a very nice person
I love watching any tasty videos with Alex in them. Her personality is contagious. Plus, she's gorgeous
Omg she makes these vids
And this is why you buy them from Trader Joe’s
Those r pan a chicolates
It's no chocolate croissant for God's sake. It's pain au chocolat. I'm french and we take pastry very seriously! But I love you anyway 😂😉
I love you alex 😍😍😍💖💖 so cute smart and talented
Support your local baker!!!
mom in progress

She's my favorite
Support your local Baker lol
I guess my stars were with me. Had got it right the first time
Rie in the background made me cackle for some reason 😂
I lost it the moment she open the door and using that sunglasses 😂😂😂😂
Exactly 1 year ago
These guys has best job in the world, they cook , they eat and also get salary
34
Actually there’re “pan o chocolates”
Can you do more I draw You Cook
I’m sorry but she’s hella faking to be cute in that intro lmao
I love how Alix just feels like a queen when she finally made it. Good job , Alix 👍👍👍
MAKING CHOCOLATE QUACKSON
The nutcracker music in the background XD
I really thought croissants were maid with puff pastry’s
I have so much respect for bakers. Like grocery stores sell a box of croissants for like 5-10 dollars
I know the feeling. I just made some myself and told my nephew that if I EVER mention making croissants again, he HAS to tell me NOOOOO. I now know the reason why pastry chefs are strong in upper back and arms. My back was killing me the day after.
HEY everyone in the comments TASTY app is out now!!!!!!
Alix is hawt like hawt hawt
I’m telling you she must be blood group o+

‘Produserrrr’ no hate i love you and you are so relatable💗💗💗
I was wondering why Alix looks so familiar & then I realized she looks so much like Migbelis Castellanos aka Miss Venezuela @ Miss Universe 2014. Literally like twins!
I want to join tasty & try recipes like this. Now that would be a dreamy job!!
i love you alix
I wonder what do they do with their incorrectly cooked foods. 🤔
Ali's is my favourite tasty Producer

The Hate U Give
_”I don’t claim to be a good baker.”_ -AK
Hey Alex, Good Job. Where is this test kitchen? I'd like to work for this TK part-time as a volunteer? Will you hire me?

Conclusion: *Tasty has a lot of refrigerators.*
she is such a beautiful girl,, bubbly and joyous ... you won the internet dear
Guys for the last time, they aren’t called chocolate croissants, they’re chocolate croissant’s monster
3:33 not a coincidence... FLOUR BUTT
The periodic table song in the back I cannnnnttt
Rie is just in the backround thinking:what is she trying to do?
Am I the only one thinking it’s a pain au chocolat
This video doesn't deserve dislikes. She's sooo amazing and her chocolate croissants are also looking amazing! ❤
I LOVE THOSEE OMLL! ❤️✨
She is so relatable!
Am I the only one offended that this video is titled chocolate croissants? They're Pains aux Chocolat... :I
She is so cute & adorable ☺️☺️
Omg she’s my favorite! She’s the best on tasty 😋💞
*"I don't claim to be a good baker."* -Alix
She is the reason to love "Tasty" <3
Alex ..  Im your new fan .. yiu are such a positive girl ♥♥
Hahaha ALIX won the PERSONALITY AWARD to all tasty chef.  She's so entertaining and funny to watch.  I love her and her lines.
That is called "pain au chocolat" not "croissant au chocolat" P.s: For the fun fact we even have in france this stupid debate  about  the name of this type of sweet bread , cuz south french ppl call it "chocolatine" and in the north "pain au chocolat"<w<                                (it was just a funny fight on twitter, cuz the general way to say it and still is "pain au chocolat)
You are full of humor
That's my fav dessert * - *
I  love Alix
how to work at buzzfeed?
Just found myself in love with Alex...
"Support you local baker" XD
Its bugging me that they're calling it croissants when its pain au choclat
Time to get my dough...where did i put it? *try’s to find it goes through all of the fridges* oh there it is😂🤙🏻
alex i love the way you cooks your the best 😆
Ali’s are you so beautiful 😍
_hi_
I’m confident that that is a pain au chocolat 🤣
Finelly..i m so proud of you...😍
After watching this watched a story and the grandpa's name was Alex lol what a coincidence
She forgot the butter layers in her earlier ones
THESE .... ARE NOT ... CROISSANTS !!!!!! It's called PAIN AU CHOCOLAT DAMMIT !! In all seriousness good job for making them ! here in France we don't bother, we just buy the dough pre-made x)
"pain au chocolat" 🍞 o 🍫
*pain au chocolat
Who else thinks that alex is awesome
Thank you for not calling it a goddamn chocolatine
Different language different u say the word its on the ppl how they say the words mga bobo
It’s a pain au chocolat 🍫 🇫🇷 my favorite thing to eat after school. Can you make a pain suisse?
I see Ria in the back round
The wine mom! I recognize everyone I love this show/series thing!
She's so pretty
Honey, they're Pain Aux Chocolats 😂😂
And then there's Rie in the back
When white clothes come in handy
7:20 SHE LOOKS SO PRETTY😍
She resembles Emily Clark a loot. Even her mannerisms. Love her really..... Muaaah
OK I like her but why isn't anyone telling her that those aren't croissants? lol
In France we called this recipe the "pain au chocolat"
Alix is my favourite person
7:20 Me when I successfully make instant ramen
2:18
They just need to have a Alex Series on Tasty
I made croissants when i was 10
My names Alex :3
Bonjour je suis français (for réal)

I DONT like Rie. She’s so judgmental towards everyone.
Mah fav

Still waiting for the cinnamon roll croissant video to come out
7:36 "You almost made me drop my croissant"-R.I.P Vines
Who thinks we should give this girl a medal for patience!!
I come from Canada so yes I speak French and English    Bonjour comment vas-tu mon nom est Léa! Parles-tu français? IN ENGLISH: Hi how are you my name is Léa! Do you speak french?
4:43 my favourite pair of tasty producers

We say « pains au chocolat » in French Lmao
shade _shade_ *_shade_*
*disclaimer: she spoke too soon*
This office is kinda cool fun I love this cru hehe
There call pan ou chocolas not chocolate croissants ❤️❤️
1:25 What tf is Rie doing?
When I first saw you vids on youtube i thought you were perfect until i saw these vids and saw your imperfecness and i love you and thank you for that
I love Alix but I was kind of annoyed that she didn't knew how to make puff pastry, as if she didn't even looked out how to do croissants? Also, I thought she had some culinary background.
I love her personality....who else?
wow, I luv everything about her....
What if after all that she bit into it and she hated the croissant 🥐 haha I would die😆!!
7:28 I was expecting her to fall ;D
Are they not called Pain au chocolat
Where I come from we call them something that I can’t spell so I will write it how it’s said. Pan-o-choc-o-late. (Ch-sh)
I love her so much she's pretty funny just PERFECT 👌🏼 ❤️❤️❤️❤️where are the people who also love her?? Than like ❤️❤️❤️
Americans saying ‘crossants’ 😩 butchering the beautiful French language
Alex is so cute. The way she gives these offhand jokes and starts laughing her cute laugh is so cute ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
So this is why the vine dude didn't want to drop his croissant....
Why is there more dislikes than likes🤔
Who else doesn't read the comments that have 1k or more but just clicks the like button lol
"Support your local baker" hahaha
Alix is so pretty
You have such a good personality I love you 😘😘😘😍😍😍
at around 2:30 you can see rie in the back being normal as alix is trying to roll the dough
3:11 Alix: Apparently, this rolling pin sucks Me: hhahahahah I literally love Alix. The jokes I learned from her are hilarious. I love you Alix💖💖💖
She is a queen she is beautiful 😇😏😉🙃😍
Pains au chocolat 💜 (venez pas m’agresser)
I love the way she doesn't give up and is always so cheerful
7:35 when she trips the noise she makes kills me 😂😂😂 "oomf"
Those are pain a chocolat
When I look at this woman I’m thinking they should call themselves “Unhealthy” instead of “Tasty”.
She is the funniest. Just in love with her.❤️
Does she even look up a recipe?
Croissant dough is so hard to make. I’m still trying and also 7:21 😂
Does Diana Ross have any recipes
step 1: pronounce it right  step 2: do step 1 :)
my mom love when i make this. well i dont. it takes a lot of time
Who else sees Rie in the background and is just like, Alix, you need to get Rie in here
I could relate to what she was goin through.. have been trying to make croissant and still no results ... Will keep trying though !!!
She's so happy that she can't get mad
They are not called chocolate croissants they’re called pain au chocolates
ALIX AND RIE VIDEOSSS PLEASE
She's so pretty :D
Thiccccccc

Nothing says "I love to bake" than a flour hand print on your butt.  Or all over your waist...
Girl u look like you could be a model. Very pretty 👍🏾
My friend makes these and he's 13 so I didn't think these would be that hard but maybe he's just a fantastic baker idk
Plz sub

*anyone gonna ship scott with another tasty producer lmao*
Looks more like *pain eu chocolate*
I love this girl!!!
Alix always speaks too soon
Anybody else think she look kind of like rhonda rousey ?
Its just a chocolatin

All thickness
Mmmm Alix thicc
7:19
So much respect for the people who bake
In those 9 days I’ve learned...       Support you local baker! 😂😂😂
Her top is literally the story of my life 😭
I think it’s a pain o chocolate or something
I'm french and that's not a croissant it's a pain au chocolat !
I’ve seen videos for the blonde boy  I think James sorry if not and I’ve seen videos for the brown hair one after him the girl and I like you and the two love you guys at tasty
she's my favourite tasty producer <3....i always end up in a good mood after watching her videos :)
Imagine having a co worker like that I would not be able to control myself 😀😅😅
THICCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC
Alix is SO HILARIOUS! Such a great host. i wish I had her positivity
"I'm a tasty produuucerr"😂😂
my grandma use to make croissants all the time. and she actually taught me how to make them at the age of 11. and now whenever i look at people fuck up on them it makes me cringe
Actually Chocolate croissant name is Pain au chocolat the real croissant doesn't have anything inside
Pain au chocolat
it’s pronounced “quackson”
They’re not chocolate croissants they’re pain au chocolate
PAIN AU CHOCOLAT
No hate but it is a pan au chocolate
CLAIRE?/???? WHATS CLAIRE DOING????? THE CULINARY MOTHER OF YOUTUBE???? WOWOW WHAT A STUNNING CROSSOVER??
She's so cute ! Like a little sunshine in your day !
For all the tasty haters, croissant or au chocolate (whatever it is) it isn’t from France, it’s a traditional dessert from Austria so shut up
I see all my idols 😤😩😭😍
French cooking is ridiculously hard  literally everything
I love watching these videos watch them everyday keep the hard work going   Ps Alix ur so cute😇
"I could've dropped my croissant!"
It's not croissants, it's petit pain
Alix with an i
0:49 she sounds like she was going back into another laughing fit
4:33 The shade ;-;
7:23 that victory hair flip she is like YESSS YESSS I FINALLY DID IT!!!!!!!!!!!!
Best channel ever
Hi tasty producers i challenge you to bake a cake with a knife up side down
she needs a cooking show where she just keeps attempting impossible baking challenges because honestly these videos are amazing haha
lol the end she was like shooook.
3:32 pause it theres hand shapes on her butt
I gave a thumb up only for her effort! 👍😂
I LOVE when she does these videos. She’s adorable
I hate to be the annoying french girl but it's called a pain au chocolat( no hate intended, i LOVE Alex❤)
Did anyone else see the handprint of flour on alixs butt?
her shirt says it all
"Ok thats hard" Thats what she said
It seems like her behind tasty episodes always go the worst but she’s always so determined and she has such positive attitude I just love her!
Damn I live in Paris and I gotta say, mad props to all the bakeries! I get a PAIN AU CHOCOLAT whenever I'm running late;
My spirit animal
I love the behind the scenes videos. Besides the humor of the unscripted moments, it's nice as a home cook to see pros have issues.
7:18 Me after all 'those' things XD
Too stupid for words...
So this is what go s on in Panera!😂
I love how tasty has so much commitment. They spend like 2 weeks on trying to make one dish😍😄
Her optimism is contagious.
Wear an apron
Call them how you want, but NEVER "chocolatines"
Thats not a croissant, thats a pain au chocolat!
This is why I buy my croissants from Starbucks 😂
7:31-7:35 when you think you look cool 7:36 when you see bae
I really like her tattoo
I need more of her!
I aspire to be like her. Her personality gives me life.
The moment when you watch this and eat a chocolate croissant from the local baker XDD
i effing love her!!!!
I love cooking
So stupid
Guys hi yes hi if you make croissants you should be rolling butter in every layer as she later discovered I love her she's absolutely hilarious 😂
Now I feel bad for the ladies at Costco
STOP I COULDA DROPPED MY *chocolate* CROISSANT
omg i love her too much
All that for 6 croissants, not this girl.
Alix is my favorite EVER!!!
THEY ARE PAIN AU CHOCOLATAS

It’s called pain au chocolat not chocolate croissant, you are fucking disrespecting French cuisine and patisserie
They taste so good
STOP.. Its a chocolate... chappati😌😌

2:17 lmao
This is hysterical! I think I’d cry after all of that too! You did such a great job! I’ve never tried making them by myself! Sally x
She eats too many things she cooks...
I love how she never gives up and tries hard omg
her hair got short....!
That's why you never watch this hungry
"Chocolate Croissants" smh
Prolly the reason why I subscribed to Tasty is either I fell in love with the food or I really love Alix? 😅

Hey Alex your Gorgeous! ✌🐼🤳
im smiling because she's happy. she just has one of those laughs that make people smile with her
Anymore else get triggered because she calls it a “chocolate croissant” instead of pain au chocolat”
You’re suppose to cut them in triangles.
5:24 “my god they look amazing” “...it’s butter”  😂😂😂😂  EDIT: okay but 6:07 was so satisfying to watch 😍

5:20 “Memrey phomy, THEYRE so soft and are SO NeAT!” I’ve been watching way to much freaking tv.

*WE LOVE A QUEEN WHO SPEAKS TOO SOON*

I made croissants for mother's day and it was difficult! I thought i did pretty good until i baked it since the butter came out and melted. Still good though
Delectable Alex....
Dat ass doe 😜
Oh and nice baking
Girl u fine! That butt tho
That is adorable and fun to watch!  I'll feel better if I have a fail or two
Is she leo decaprio‘s sister?
Its not a chocolate croissant ist a pan o chocola
I was triggered because they ain’t even croissants, it’s like the macaroon and macaron thing
Do any of you know her instgram
Favorite tasty producer💕💕💕💕
She's definitely wife material! Can bake, cook and still looks with less make up hot and beautiful! :O <3
In the france we call them  pain au chocolate
I almost dropped my croissant when I saw the title
I wish I had a area to use like this I don’t have a place for things like this and I love baking
Nice job. I was a pastry cook for 12 years. Not an easy thing to accomplish. Koodo's
U MAKE ME FEEL like;  "WHAT IS "wrong" with me" bkz I follow the recipes & they usually work. oh, my gosh, watching your attempts videos of making one recipe, makes me pretty nervous now, but its funny dow.
She is soooo cute. Thick, blonde and a bubbly personality. What else can you ask for?
I love her personality. These videos are so fun to watch
That is not a croissant  What the hell is wrong with America That’s a bloody pain au chocolat Not a chocolate croissant What kind of croissant is shaped like that It’s a pain au chocolat Jesus This hurts I suppose Americans don’t eat as many French pastries as us How is that a croissant
5:24 Hannah still works here yay! Nice croissants
Esta mujer es mi consuelo😂pense q era la única  q le salian las cosas mal😂
Quackson
Panera is shaking
"Support your local baker" 😂💞
They’re actually called pana chocolate
She reminds me of badison of off orange is the new black😂😂
Alix is by far my favorite Tasty producer  Rie is a close second
5:23 Hannahhhhh
There Is alwise 3+ days with Alix. Love her
That’s why pastry chefs were almost always big burly men. Rolling out dough is hard work!
She is me.
It is so funny to hear her say TASTY PRODUCER 😂
7:19 ADELLLLLEEEEEE!!!!!!❤❤❤❤❤
Bruh her in that black dress 😍😍😍😍
'Support your local baker' Aye, never realised it was so hard to make croissants, especially when they're usually the cheapest
so fun to watch her videos!
Watching Alix fails but doing this over and over again give me more confidence while cooking :D
I love that I keep getting contact lenses ads before tasty videos but the ad is blurry AF lol oh irony
7:19 ssshhhh
I love Alix!!! she's the best at baking
I'd smash
U cook 20 times better than me
I love this channel series. Alex is so wonderful and easy to watch.
ummmmmmmmm I know this is off subject but did anyone else have a add before this video that was a movie called dog days?
Omg she looks like Rhonda rousey!!! I love this girls personality!
The butter doesn't make CO2, WTF?!?! The ignorance is to much, the only reason I watch these videos because Tasty "chefs" can barely make a good laminated dough right. Butter makes steam a the water within it evaporates. Yeast makes CO2 as a result of fermentation. Chocolate croissants are easy to make.
Chocolate croissant are the easiest pastry to make
She is sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo Beautiful
do people who make croissants make them in refrigerated rooms? xD
tasty producers do dna test?
GIVE HER HER OWN SERIES !
I watch these videos to make myself starve
Damn she's sexy as hell.
I LOVE HER VIBE!!! SHES SO GORGEOUS TOO 😭😭💓 IM CRUSHING HARD
What a gorgeous girl!
Quackson?
She’s literally smiling through the whole thing
i feel like it's so much fun working at buzzfeed
They are not chocolat croissant they are pain au chocolat thank u
All this tells me is to eat croissants any chance i get cause they be making them FOR 3 DAYS.
Agar Agar
They should make behind behind tasty
Melting butter does not release co2.. it puffs up because the butter keeps the layers from sticking, I have no idea where you got the first explanation.
Aren't they just pain au chocolats?
That's not a fucking croissant, it's called chocolatine
You did it
That’s a pain au chocolat NOT a croissant 🤦🏽‍♀️
Alex is like the perfect woman though.
As someone who made croissants for a grade, I can say they are exactly this hard to make. The worst part is taking too long because the better will melt and your dough will flatten fast making a big mess.
Even after 100*100 times folds ,you can never be sure that it is even remotely gonna look like a croissant at the end😂😂
7:24 I was praying that the croissants 🥐 didn’t fall right there and then
IVE BEEN MAKING THESE SINCE 2012 WITH NUTELLA STOP STEALING MY IDEAS  I live your videos though :)
I love her smile
Did anyone notice the hand prints on her butt at 3:33
2:55 “Are you gonna cut?” LMFAO
Alix is so damn cute. I could watch her bake every day. This croissants look good just like alix does and the both have really nice layers. XD
Why do Americans pronounce everything wrong. It's pronounced quasaunts not crusants
I'm in love with Alex
Chocolate croissants are the best, i had some in italy once, so frigan good
Gosh this woman is amazing !!??!?🔥
is this not just a pain au chocolate
That's not the only thing looking tasty...
I LOVE CHOCOLATE CROSSIANTS I AM OBSESSED WITH THEM
7:19
I just love her so much❤️ her attitude is gold
in France they generally call them pain au chocolat xx
7:17 dats how i feel after getting  straight A on all my tests
My mom knowd how to make them
Omg at least u know how to cook I can barley cook
Rie in the background though
I NEED MORE VIDEOS OF ALIX
But this is an extremely easy and common item to make...
lol the ratio of food used to food wasted is like 1 to 1 million
Rie i the background lol
Y you so sweat woman I love you
Found a hair on one of the croissants but its ok
This video should be called " How to make people NEVER think about making croissants EVER! " but I guess It was too long 🌚
I like your hourglass tattoo Miss.Alex!
LEROOOYYYY JENKINSSSSSSSSSS
interior hat recent passenger pop dynamic cash engineer integration.
Alex is honestly my favorite
Note to self, NEVER make croissants. Ever.
Pain au chocolat
A sheeter
I need this right now
I consider only horn-shaped croissants as CROISSANTS.
At 7.19 slow it down to 0.25x and  you can see her underwear. Your welcome😀
🌼🌸💝🌼🌸💝🌼🌸💝🌼🌸💝🌼🌸💝🌼🌸💝🌼🌸💝🌼🌸💝🌼🌸💝🌼🌸💝
she kinda looks like Daenerys  🐉
Isn’t this Pain au chocolat?
Alex why are you so gorgeous?????
It's called pain au chocolat
2:15  *hehe boi*
I'm obsessed w her personality. I love it so much. I watch the video so I could see how much she tries, rather than actually caring what happens.
i cried just one tear when she tripped over the counter
I love these videos because it shows that not every tasty chef, baker or employee  makes it on their first try, therefore neither shall we
She stupid
It's not a pain-au-chocolat, you northern swine, it's a chocolatine.
Fuck all these fat feminists
I like watching alex struggle and idk why. It is just too relatable
7:22 You walking in the classroom knowing you are going to ace the exam then 7:37 Turns our you fail.
Me : *quietly speaking in the back* chocolatine
I think I'm in love.
I’m not a tasty producer and I made these for the first time and they were perfect
these videos make me realise i don’t respect the videos enough x
She cute af
I once tried making pain au chocolat for a french class of mine and they turned out hard as bricks 😂
the ending was worth it...
I absolutely love Alex.  ❤️❤️
she is soooooooooo cuteeeeeeeeeeee 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
They’re pain au chocolat not croissants
Thicccccccc!!!! Alix is so happy and bubbly! I love her personality! And she is sooooo pretty!
I LOVE CHOCOLATE CROISSANTS!!!!!!!!! OMGGGGGG😍😍
I just love how in every video she doesn't complain much and never gives up
Just buy croissants put chocolate spread in and put in oven
Oh les français.... pain au chocolat ou chocolatine ??? 😂😂
I don’t know why these are so much better than the actual videos. Maybe it’s because I don’t have to close out extra fast so I don’t have to hear that “ohhh yessss” ever again.
don't say God's name in vain
Never know them to be called that before! In Europe we call them pain au chocolat
its called pain au chocolat
The butter won’t melt to make CO2. The butter will melt and create steam which will rise through the dough. The varying layers of butter allow more steam to push out thus creating flaky layers.
I freaking love Alex! Literally have been only watching her episodes! She’s freaking hilarious! 😂
Alex your super cute! Definitely the cutest tasty producer!!!
I like her cause she’s hella goofy

Your enthusiasm is contagious. A pasta machine might help rolling the "pâte feuilletée"!? Great video. Cheers
Do yourself a favor and just go to Panera, trust me.
For all the American/English speaking countries : chocolate croissant is not a thing it's called "pain au chocolat" (chocolate bread basically) so stop using those please u're making my tiny French heart bleed every time ... 😂
They’re called pain au chocolates
gonna give this a thumbs up for that exit. sometimes you gotta be a little extra.
Chocolate quacksons
Quackson
I like that rie is looking at her hahahaha and not helping her
6:56 SHE'S SO CUTE
I would love to see cinnamon roll croissants!!
She reminds me of Trisha Paytas (srry if I spelled her last name wrong 💀)
Ugh she’s so sweetttt she’s definitely my fav after Rei
Loved the last sean
I made these in Poland with my family since I was 5 they were hard to make at first but got it after my first try
Wow she must've gone through a lot of pain (au chocolat) to make those
Dang shes so beatiful
It’s a pain au the butt to make Chocolate croissants 😂😂🥐🍫
Thats not croissant thats pain au chocolat
5:t0 you cant make cinnamon roll croissants because he still need the flakes on top so it would just be a cinnamon roll log
I subscribed just for her... what a great set of personality.
she thick but annoying asf👎🏽
She's a "Tasty" Producer, if ya know what I mean .. 😏
I LOVE YOUR BUBBLY PERSONALITY, KIND OF LIKE THE co2 BUBBLE MADE BY THE MELTED BUTTER
Ya girl is thiccccc
best intro lmao 😂😂😂
Look at ríe in the background at 2:30
The “R” in Croissant is not pronounced
I love this lady! She's funny, hardworking and GORGEOUS ♥️
God now Americans are gonna start calling them “chocolate croissants” they’re actually called in most of France “pain ou chocolate” but in southern France they’re called “choclatine” but I’m not hating just pointing out facts
"Support your local baker" lol
It’s a pain au chocolat not what you Americans say chocolate croissant
Alix is so cute but can we also appreciate Rie? That shade she is throwing is so cute coming from such a sweet chef as well lol
😂😂 when you proud bc you finnaly did it
Laughs excessively on unfunny things acts immature
Hilarious
It’s actually a quackson
Dat ass
If she had cut the dough into triangles they would’ve looked more like croissants
My grandma makes really good croissants filled with nuttella 🤤🤤🤤
I never realized how much work went into a tasty video
It is her biggest accomplishment,DOUGH it was hard to do
Those are not chocolate croissants, they are pain au chocolat
Those glasses tho
Thicc
*the dough is so thick with two c's thicc*
2:19 that's what she said ;)
Yum! Chocolate quacksons!      *anyone understand? Any other Tom Holland fans out here?*
Rie is just like wut da fuq is this women doing.
I love Alix 😍
Rie in the background lol
I loved this
Uh excuse me I came here for the giant chocolate croissants pictured in the thumbnail
Alix, please make more videos.  This one and the giant macaron are the best tasty videos - and I’ve watched almost all of them.
u go girl clapping for u!!!!
She the cutest
It's really sophisticated, and you're really attractive
That is a pain au chocolat
What is the name of the music at 2:43?
Pain au chocolat. It's called pain au chocolat!
She's so pretty ❤❤
Add flour salt sugar and yeast then mix and after that add water and eggs then let it rise and rest in the refrigerator for 24 hours use baking paper and roll it out as a square and add a square block of butter in the middle and fold the sides then fold and roll out the dough as much as you like you croissants (the less folding the less flaky) and most important cut them into triangles
I just need to correct the title.. *MhM* It's *pAiN aU cHoColat* not croissants
Seymour where u at?
the ladies from tasty are so cute
its so amazing that the background music is the periodic table music
So... how do you make them?
Video title: Eays recipe overnight chocolate croissants yummy Actual Time: 9 EFFING DAYS
...was that Rie in the background?
Yo wats her IG forreal tho
As a french I can tell you, only crazy people attend to do theses at home, we just buy them fresh at the bakery every time
I want to work at tasty being paid to make food
I died laughing :))))))
I don't know what's so satisfying about watching others trying to bake. I just love it
the trick to croissants is LARGE pieces of butter... when i made them i spread even pats of butter all over my dough and rolled the pats into the dough when rolling it out! :)
IM DYING ITS CALLED PAN AU CHOCOLAT
she's cute af!! I'm not kidding!
So much waste
Love this gurl
omg! is that claire from bon apetit?
"So much internet to do"... Me 99%!
Look at rie in the background
Omg your so beautiful.. ❤
So annoying the beginning of the video
I really like these videos because it shows that even really good chefs/bakers have trial and errors. Plus they are very entertaining.
IM LOVING HER HAHAHAHAHLMAO
i can see Rie in the back being disappointed in Alix😂😂😂
She's wearing all black  while working with a ton of flour  *jus sayin*
I would absolutely love to be a tasty producer!
7:25 Imagine she just dropped the whole tray.😂
I’d LOVE to have that job😂😂😂
Rie in the backround omg i love Rie so much
*LEROYYYYYY JENKINSSSSSSSSSSSSSS*
In french we say : Pain au chocolat and not chocolate croissant
OMG I remember Alix from the 100% pure video!!!! So gorgeous
Rie in the back.. Mind: Should I help her nah let her suffer
Chocolate quacksons?
Any one else love her personality. She is so positive an bubbly.
Does she know that she is supposed to put butter between the folds? 😂😂 Edut: I spoke too soon, she figured it out!
this video made me appreciate croissants more
Read !!! The !!! Description !!!!!!!!!
what's her name
"she spoke to soon" Me: XD 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
You know that flour is on your pants
T h i c c
Did they bleep the word god
This is y i come on here just to remind my self that the 4 -8 min clips takes a lot longer in real life lol
My mum and sister made chocolate croissants (or pain au chocolats )in a day and they said it was super easy.
I love how she's so positive lol "hee, we are gonna have a mental breakdown" lol... Not trying to be offensive to people who get mental breakdowns, I do too, but it's just the fact that she laughed about it and had fun with it made it funny
I’d rather eat her
You should let it melt just a little before rolling it out
2:31 Rie in the background: I will be totes chill and move this microwave before Alix shits it up. GG
You almost made me drop my Croissant!!
Hi Claire!
Look at rie XD
Looks super hard. Will continue to buy.
I love these videos and I think Tasty should upload one each week. She is super funny and always makes us laugh!
So good
7:20 f*ck of b*tch i got crrosiant
Technically the real name is "Pain au chocolat", or "chocolatine" if you're evil. Also, you should let the rise before putting them in the oven, it makes them even "lighter".
Americans say Croissant so wrong
Hi
When you fold the dough you have to let it chill for 30 minutes and then fold again
The bottom was all burnt
ITS NOT A CROISSANT ITS ‘pain au chocalat
Did you mean a pain au chocolat
pain au chocolate not chocolate  croissant
U weren’t supposed to roll them diagonally...
I would love to do.what you are doing..what is your job need you to.do
2:31 Rie is just like "wut?"
7:20 for a moment I thought she was Corinne from Threadbanger
Take your ring off, please. It's unsanitary.
THAT IS NOT A CHOCOLATE CROISSANT ITS A PAIN AU CHOCOLAT
Alex kinda looks likes Rhonda rousy
4:44 😍😍😍😍😘😘😘  SCOTT...........😚 I want Scott to be in all of the tasty  videos.........
2:30 Rie is just there like “u ok?”
I’d love to work at tasty
I spy Rie in the background!!!
does anyone else think that at the end when it says “oh yes” it sounds like david dobrik?
Damn. I love her personality
I really like this is girl
She needs her own regular segment
My mom can make chocolate croissants
For me Alix is the best Tasty producer in the world 😂😂😂
I'm making crepes *that's what I heard*
When you watch this on not behind sence it's kinda easy to do hahaha lol
2:16 evidence that she scratched her butt
I really really really like her!!!!
All i could focus on in some parts was Rie in the back.😂
7:19 How you think you look like when you accomplish something hard XD
congratulations you just made the most common pastry in Europe... also they are not croissants
Me before the video:Hmm... Maybe I can be a tasty producer in the future...  Me after the video:NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE
7:19
Stop I could've baked my croissant
I never knew I could beat my meat to someone making croissants
2:27 Rie in the back ground tho she could of helped
"pain au chocolat" uR DAMN RIGHT WITH EXTRA PAIN
Rie is behind her at 2:23
I had to do that for my exam at bakery school😓
as a croissant lover and a chocolate lover just surround me with this and it will be heaven
It's pain au chocolat not '' chocolate croissant''
She didn't laminate the butter and just folded it ... that was never gunna create pastry
Yyyyy!
Those are Napolitanas
Or u could get cressant rolls in the can and then put chocolate chips in them and roll them up and bake then for 7 min :P
Once...
I don’t think she realizes that she probably needed to knead it more if it was cracking on day 1
Why does she remind me of Kelly Clarkson?
no no no no it's called "pain au chocolat" or "chocolatine" not chocolate croissant xD
shes so cute !!
She is very cute nd pretty nd funnyy.
“Support your local baker” 😂😂😂😂
I see rie
I love seeing Alix so happy. It's adorable!
Chocolate croissant .... okaaay it's chocolatine, couque au chocolat or pain au chocolat :)
😍 love her
I wonder what the camera person feels and thinks
pain au chocolate it really is a pain in the ass
Did anyone actually try this? I don’t think the directions are correct.
I love the way she is soooo proud of her hard work!!
Alix is body goals... 😫😫
Idk what it is about her, but I keep coming back to this specific video 😂
I’m dead!! 😂💀
7 27 Nest moment
I dunno how it is in America, but in Austria you can buy the dough pre-made and making croissant is hella easy. Never thought making the dough by scratch would be that difficult, lucky me then.
Ps your body is amazing can I have it??
I’ve been lied too by pilsbury.
It’s not called a chocolate croissant 😂but anyway great job
I LOVE caramel croissants CUZ my friends mom made croissants and cut it in half and put home made caramel in it IT WAS THE BEST THING U COULD HAVE TASTED IN THE FLIPPIN WORLD
Instructions unclear. I flowerd my surface not the board
7:19 When I proudly present my homework which I spent days working on
5:21😂😂😂lol       You are going to throw them in the trash 🚮?? 😱😢
Eyyyy fornetti
I gave up on life now I'm always eating good and watching anime.I'm as happy as I can be.😌

Hold the front page choclate crossaints are the same as pain au chocolates??? Or is this just more American vocabulary???☕☕☕☕☕☕☕☕☕☕☕☕☕☕☕
Rie is like wtf you good?
How did NONE of her co-workers inform her she's supposed to be rolling triangles, not squares....
Funny cause they ain't croissants, there Pain au chocolat
As a baker, this is so painful to watch.
Wish I could get a job there .
@2:25 Meanwhile Rie calmly in the background
It's actually panui chocolate
I really love her she's so sweet , funny and beautiful
So that’s how you make quacksons
where i live ive never seen it called anything but chocolatine and im about to swing
I like this girl doing them
*pain au chocolat in french not croissant
over acting
can we talk about how both chefs in bon appetit and tasty are called Claire.
i made pastry dough once too. sudden newfound respect to all pastry chefs directly after...
I don't call them chocolate croissants I called them chocolatines
What do you call ppl that work as food producer

Cinnamon roll croissant more like cinnamon chocolate bread sticks
1:37 Hi Roy how are you ? * in background *

Can i ask why she kept looking up?
Chocolate croissants are my favorite thing to make one you make them a couple of times they get super easy to make.
alix looking like a snack
Talk about foundation lips
THATS A FUCKING PAIN AU CHOCOLAT
One of the best food videos
Omg it's Rie at the back HIIIII
Y'all need to read the description
How many producers do they have geez
You could go through all this hard work and time...or just go to starbucks😂😂😂😉 good job though
Im sorry but im 13 and i make it in one day
They are not called chocolate croissant, They are called "pan aux chocolats" which means chocolate bread in French.
Alix is a tasty producer 😉
T H I C C Girl
Even Rei the queen lol
As a French person, there are 2 things that bother me in this video:  1. These are not croissants, these are PAIN AU CHOCOLAT. 2. The first ones she makes are not the actual shape of a pain au chocolat.  However, I've never made a croissant or a pain au chocolat so praises to you for trying.  PS: just FYI, French people don't generally know how to make any of these, we just go to the bakery to buy them. It's too complicated to mke a good one.
That is a pain au chocolat
The lady is beautiful 💝
Are you going to finish that cronsont
Wait: I’m half French (and Spanish) And I love how you call them chocolate croissants, they are USUALLY called   PAIN  AU  CHOCOLAT   Pronounced “panoshocola”, this name makes the south western French people get mad at the rest of the French territory...
waste of food :((
7:18 That sunglasses tho XD
u cant bake
lol Rie nonchalantly moving microwave in the back
Where is the butter layer
Thicc
Me and my brother only used one day to make it, and it looks and taste delicious
Honestly I wish I had her positive driven mindset 👏🏻 she did it ! 💖
She thicc af
Not gonna lie... Felt like  I'd be mad if I didnt get to see you eat one of those & I dont know why
Friend: "I made them once & Never again"  Her: "Why Does everybody keep saying that?!" Looking at how hard it was for you & hearing how long its supposed to take I have no idea why you're surprised. If I heard sth like this takes 3 Days to make I would stop trying right there
Absolutely love her
Determination 👏🏽
Those aren’t chocolate croissants, they’re called “pain au chocolat”
5 seconds in, she is so fucking cute
OMG HOW IS ALIX SO DAMN PRETTY!!?!?!?? HOW??
Chocolat Croissant ? What the Fuck is a Chocolat Croissant, it’s Chocolat Bread mate
0:01 There only can be ONE Alex! XD
this video is so funny and interesting and I'm seriously gay for Alix; she's so pretty and funny
If you saw Rie in that back when she was rolling the dough Rie was like wtf
CHOCOLATINE
I love how Rie was just silently judging her from behind lol gotta love rie!
🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺
Black dress really showed that ass.  Someone had to say it.
Im so proud of you because you never give up
I am not a big fan of croissants but u made me rethink that! 😊😊
More Alix please
I’m not f-ing kidding it’s midnight where I live, once I finished this video I went downstairs opened my fridge and ate 3 chocolate croissants 🥐 😂
Butter melts and makes carbon dioxide wat did u get in chemistry
So many people in the comments correcting Tasty for saying chocolate croissants, not noticing both the french name in the description AND the error on it as well (chocolate doesn't take the end e in french)...  Also props for the chocolatine people. Vous êtes bien seuls dans votre guerre. (on vous voit les sudistes)
Omg it's Rie!
I fell asleep while watching this.
The "chocolate croissant" was so confusing for my french brain, I first thought it was about a cacao dough croissant or something even weirdest. We just called them "pain au chocolat" ("chocolate bread") or "chocolatine" (if you come from southwest France), but technicaly it is the same dough as croissant. Great video though, this really look like a pain au chocolat from a french bakery :)
So much  hard work.
Chocolat croissant don't exist!!! Either it's called pain au chocolat or it's called Chocolatine (depending on where you live in France!) But chocolate croissant don't EXIST
... you mean pain au chocolat
She's so cute
Did you buy a share in a make up company?
i made croissants once too. i agree. never again
Tasty producer.... Doesn't know what to do, but at the same time me, making a box cake
funny thing is thats not a croissant but a pain de chocolat
At the end of most  videos who says o yesss!
LOVE HER ATTITUDE!!!
But that ASS tho
She should've said it is a grate work out. Get it? GRATE.     Ok I'll leave now
UHHH THATS NOT CHOCOLATE CROISSANTS
Oh, in dutch we call them just plain coffeecookies
PAIN. AU. CHOCOLAT.
I FREAKIN' LOVE RIE JUST MINDING WHAT SHE'S DOING AT THE BACK. LOL
This video annoyed me so much when i watched it because she complained so much like i get its hard but she technecly signed up to be chef like she was a chef to cook and challenge herself not complain about what she is cooking cause its hard.
Love the music at the start fuk ye
Why did her hair change from braids to a bun
thats not a croissant. isnt that a pan au chocola
Les américains ils s’en battent les c de notre débat pain au chocolat/chocolatine, eux ils appellent ça croissant au chocolat
I love watching her!

Ohhh Tchaikovsky’s tune in the background fits so well!
I've been where she's been with the laminated dough. Workout!!!
As a french watching this , it makes me sad ..... Sorry but this is not the recipe at all
Pain au chocolat ou Chocolatine?               Debate mes amis
Jesus, learn how to pronounce croissant.
For me baking is not so difficult to do as long you have patience to do it.
You so funny and sweet person alex..😊😊

Jeez peeps in the comments keep saying"oh ,that's pain au chocolate ,it's not crossiant!!!"like seriously,who cares tasty calls them crossaint,stop criticising tasty.(sorry if I spelt crossaint wrongly)
To make croissants you have to cut the dough into triangles

Chocolate croissants= pain au chocolat😒😒
"Pain au chocolat " not "croissant"
Grl just buy puff pastry. 😂😂😂
There is Rie!
I would be surprised if alix doesn't have a boyfriend
Aw I love her!
PAIN AU CHOCOLAT OU CHOCOLATINE
She's like Trisha Paytas dunked into a vat of Holy Water.
It's in the difficult level of cooking 😖
She’s the cutest like I’m dying
Ok ok, we got it people, they are not croissants
I tried making Chocolate croissants using this recipe. I'm qouting Alexis and the girl with glasses here "NEVER AGAIN"
That ass tho
I LOVE HER LOL
she looks so charmed when walking out with the final croissants :))
I love alix
For those who are considering to say and who have said this is Pain au chocolate read the description it will tell you they know that this is a Pain au chocolate. Don’t disrespect Alix like that thank you 😂
My god she's beautiful
Wow she's very painted
They are called  pain au chocolat
She and Rie are my favorite people in Tasty. ❤
I loved determination
You can totally see her panties when she kicks the door open 😂😂😂😂
I watched this video like four times now , i love it SO MUCH
She’s like the lily of tasty . Clever style fans like 👍🏼♥️
if you know m.salah do like now
Doesn't know how to bake, makes video on how to bake. #worthless
Whole time I was thinking what is she doing. Does she not do research before she tries recipes.
We Need More Alix Videos!!!
You just waste everything.
0:08 turn caption on
My eye twitched every time she said, ' Chocolate croissant'. They're called Pain au Chocolat 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Hey if anyone notices roy in the background roy is my surname
Shes pretty and s funny
Support your local baker XD
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
And they expect use viewers to recreate those recipes
this is actually pain au chocolat but i liked the video
7:19 me when i do my homework on time😂😂🔫
Oooooh, that hair flip tho'!
These are actually called pain au chocolat  It’s common French knowledge  I’m from the uk btw
i love alix , you funny ..so entertaining ..pleae do more alix .. hihi
OooOoOoOo she thiqque
After 4 yrs she finally did it this is hilarious omg
She could’ve dropped her croissant
Looks shit
The expressions in the end were so lit tho😎😂
shes so funny and relatabe
They're called pain au chocolat, not croissants
What did you just call that... A CHOCOLATE CROISSANT! Its a PAIN AU CHOCOLAT ( or chocolatine les francais on va pas partir en debt
Hurray she dint give up
She is super sexy and funny
I can tell she isn"t the best baker but what about chef?. Maybe you could read instructions and watch videos about making the specific product. If you haven't already?
Isn't the butter supposed to be incorporated layer by layer ? This doesn't look like croissant dough
ive made these for my cooking class in school and they turned out good.. but i understand her struggles 😂
i think i heard the nutcraker theme in the background
Everyone working on tasty is a producer?
i need a friend like her 😩😩😩
Can't figure out why they used the shot where she is glad she has panties on 7:19 at the end of the video too... Haha in case you missed it.... Here's that honeypot again!
They are not croissants (shape) you are making pain au chocolat.
My school sell chocolate croissant😂
I clicked for Alex :))
When their head of culinary said croissants take three days...she was right. Traditionally they are made with a starter to activate the yeast, then the folds with the chilled butter block she used, allow them to rest in between folds, you proof them a million times, and then you shape them and bake on day three (of course you have to be up by 4 am if you want them fresh for breakfast). No wonder I can't find a good croissant within a 2000000 mile radius.
aaaaah i am sorry i think u may bee need an a apron y mean u r making  a food like a kid spreading all over side best of luck
Oo
She’s hot what the heck
She’s so bubbly and pretty, I love her!!!!!
They say grating the butter isn’t a great trick but they don’t show what to do instead do they mean the slabs of butter in the middle is the replacement
your not suppose to grate butter into flakey pastry you are suppose to be able to see the butter
Is that not a pain au chocolat
That hair flip xD
7:19
EXTRA THICCC
Why do fat girls wear yoga pants?
We did croissant in 2 days in my baking class, they could have risen for an extra few hours, but they were pretty good
ok but why does she lowkey look like Nikkie Tutorials
She got a phatt attitude. Thicc. I like a thicc attitude... thicc.
You morons this completely wrong technique to make croissant dough, all u are making is a leavened enriched dough. She isn't laminating the dough at all, just all wrong. Do your research properly, how can u own a whole channel abt food and get something so basic so wrong.
Sorry did they just bleep out the word ‘Damn!’ What?!
She is pretty and cute..... So adorable!
DES CHOCOLATINES
Looks more like a pain eu choclate
They look more like pan au chocolat
I salute her cause she didn't give up bravo!👏😊😊
i need more videos of her
D U M M Y   T H I C C
2:25 RIE IN THE BACKGROUND LOL😂 she looks so serious
When I’m done with collage I’m applying here
she has to put butter between every roll or otherwise isnt a croassant
THESE ARE NOT CROISSANTS!!!!!!! Croissant means crescent, these are technically something called 'pain du chocolate', a traditional French pastry. 'Pain du chocolat' translates to 'bread of chocolate' as a direct translation, or more accurate 'bread with chocolate'. Just saying as a French-speaking Canadian, these definitely are not croissants.🇨🇦🇫🇷 Translation:CE N'EST PAS DES CROISSANTS !!!!!!! Croissant signifie croissant, ce sont techniquement ce qu'on appelle la «douleur du chocolat», une pâtisserie traditionnelle française. «Pain du chocolat» se traduit par «pain de chocolat» en traduction directe ou «pain au chocolat» plus précis. Je dis simplement en tant que Canadien francophone, ce ne sont certainement pas des croissants. »
"I'm not a good baker." Alex 2k1imtoolazytocheckwhenthiswasmadebutiassumeit's8
That's not a croissant..
(It’s called a pan au chocolat) edit: butchered the spelling btws
They’re actually not “croissant” but “pain au chocolat” in France....
Approximately 80% of the French population call that a “pain au chocolat”. The other 20% call it a “chocolatine”. It’s something French people have been arguing about for decades, so I guess Tasty just don’t want to take part to this fight and they decided to write “chocolate croissant”. That’s smart. Btw, I’m French, and I say “chocolatine”
more of these please! love watching the cooking videos but prefer hearing the how-tos from the people making them, rather than just font on a screen. Plus! It's always nice to see that others struggle just as much as you do sometimes
I love rie in the background!!!
It’s not a chocolate croissant it’s a pain au chocolate
Croissant refers to the Cresent shape of a croissant. Pain au chocolate means" bread containing Chocolate". Get it right alix
pain au chocolat
They’re no croissants 🥐 they’re pain au chocolas
AAAA ALIX IS SO CUTE I LOVE HER!!! (Also who is man at 4:48?? Where did he come from and how have I never come across him)
I want her as my best friend.
u shouldve cut the dough in triangles
Honestly, if a professional baker took days to make these, I don't know if i'd want to try as it might take me 2 years.:)
fy va hon är gullig a kolla på! :D (damn she cute in swedish) :)
Wait CLAIRE! Like BA Claire??? She’s tasty’s head of culinary???
love when she laughs... adorable
This is what I call a comfort video
7:30 - Me, emerging from the kitchen after making a bowl of Top Ramen. 😂 I literally can’t cook anything worth a crap. I’m proud of her for succeeding.
I'd eat Alex
Can someone explain why tasty doesn't employ experienced chefs. Coz if you're a business you don't wanna waste ingredients. No offense I like her she's cool.
Rie in the background 😄😂
You should have misplaced the dough earlier😂😂😂😂 sorry but that just sounded funny😂😂😂
Comment section:  80% the woman in the video  50% fuccbois  40% complainers
They're called pain au chocolats!!!!
So cute not funny I  like her:)
*SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL BAKER*
This came out in my birthday!!!!
She reminds me of hilary duff
I need to know if I'm the only one who does this so please like if you've been watching YouTube for more than an hour straight because I have help😂
My mom makes chocolate croissants but they’re bigger and they’re so good, we’re from Albania (Europe).
After watching this I went to the actual vid lol who did the same
I love her she’s my favorite
What the fuck do you mean difficult
i don't why but she reminds me of a chubby daenerys.
She's so cute
I wanna make a 1 million layer chocolate croissant
Does Alix have an Instagram?
she reminds me of trisha paytas
ALIX IS GREAT ! We want to see her more !!!!
More videos with Alix!!!
eso es una napolitana, no un croissant
She is so cute❤❤❤
Subscribing for Alex's sparkling personality, not even joking
Sponge green cake. I would like you to make that so i could make it.  Its so delicious but not many people want to share their receipe 😤
*QUACKSON*
it's pain au chocolat, guys ;) a croissant is called a croissant because it has a (not full) moon shape. I actually never saw a chocolate croissant, but if that exist, it would be in a moon - type of shape ^^
I want more videos of her baking!
why don't you hire professional bakers for doing these?
I like how you can see rei in the background reacting
IS NOT CHOCOLATE CROISSANT ITS F******* PAIN AU CHOCOLAT !!!J
Alix, you're amazing! Such a beautiful and funny woman. I thoroughly enjoy every one of your videos. Lots of love
Whoever watches Tasty videos, needs to watch this video. 1) It's not as quick and easy as it seems. 2) It takes MANY tries. 3) They're also newbies.
You a chubby lil mama
these are not croissant. croissant are the one who are shaped like a moon and there are nothing like pain au chocolat (which is what she made). tasty producers need to make researchers when they’re trying to make foreign recipes, cause people might get confused when they go to france and want to order a « chocolate croissant » but it doesn’t exist..  not hating just saying
Alix is sooo funny
She fine
Who else is obsessed with Alex?
I mean they are pain au chocolat but okay
I respect my school cafeteria cooks so much more now for having choc croissants each morning
I just wanna appreciate the hardwork and determination this girl has in herself! I love her spirit of not giving up and big kudos to her! ❤
Alex is really cute! I would like her as my private chef!
Looool she’s really funny aswell she should be featured more
You guys should make all tasty videos more like this!!! This is great!
"Hi Guys Im Alix im a Tasty..."
I'm french an this title appals me. WE CALL THEM PAINS AU CHOCOLAT 🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️ chocolate croissants (croissants au chocolat) are a whole different thing 😭
😂 l thunk she so cute
Wtf is no one mentioning the fact that there is a small possibility that 'claire' is probably claire from bon appetit...oh wait I'm the only one without a life.
I think it’s kinda funny how they produced this video for us the viewers, with anticipation that we’ll try it. Why would I wanna try this when a damn professional cook can’t even do it 😂😂
Is it just me or is it that I can't watch tasty because then you get super hungry?
okay, she is literally the IDEAL BFF!!!
Pain au chocolat ?
She thicc
Stop I could have dropped my croissant
I’m really like this girl!
I just realized. She looks like Tamara from Channel Awesome.  EDIT: She's the Laya Slaya!
Drink water with your chapped ass lips
I love chubby girls
She's so adorable! Love her!
"croissanTE" u're not supposed to pronounce the t
She reminds me of Trisha paytas
I love her personality 😂😂 she’s so bubbly and happy
*pain au chocolat 👍
So pain aux chocolat, not Chocolate croissants? They look fucking good though👌🏾
Im always wondering bout the people behind tasty videos i never realized that they have it here 😍😍😍 im lovin it
she is soooo fun
this is pain au chocolat, not croissants heh
7:22 when i pass the hardest test
Everyone making the "pain au chocolat" comment, "chocolate croissants" probably will pull more searches in america than the "true" name. Also, as someone who worked in a bakery for almost 3 years and still bakes as a hobby, I would personally never make croissants at home again after my first few attempts because they're just not worth the time labor for the result you get at home. Most professionals have more efficient refrigerators, air conditioning, and use a dough sheeter that can roll stone hard dough into thin sheets
love it!!! but.... that is a pain au chocolat not a croissant
Now watching tasty’s recipes will make me laughting 😂😂
u r so cute
8:07 we all know that wasn’t the ones she made lol😂
I like these videos cause it shows all the fuck ups. People can learn from these! I know they put tips in their videos but not always
I love Tasty and this is a cute AF video, but do any of these producers have any food experience? They  sorta seem few and far between.
BBW
The thumbnail made me think it was Lily from Clever
I love how tasty makes everything look so easy
I really like how she kept a smile on her face the entire time
Her smile is so adorable
*-SEYMOUUUUUR-*
Chocolate croissants are called pain au chocolat (pan-oh-shock-oh-la-t)
they're called pain au chocolat and not chocolate croissant
I have the most fun in your videos
"are you gonna finish that CwOsSoNt"
Omg I want to make cinnamon roll croissants! It’s so funny you said that! Figure in the traditional croissant form, how you typically fold the butter into the layers, make a cinnamon sugar butter to be rolled throughout, and top with glaze when they’re finished baking! Love watching your videos of behind the scenes!!
You think Tasty makes everything look so easy. Think again!   Ladies and gentlemen, we are seeing the struggles of Tasty right here and every Tasty behind the scenes video 😂
It's Pain au Chocolat. Not a croissant. Not a chocolate croissant. It is a Pain au Chocolat.
2:19 that's what she said ...
She's so cute!!! I think i have a girl crush now
I'm french and these are actually called "Pain au chocolat" (some will tell you they're called "chocolatine" but don't believe them)
shes so cute i wanna give her a big kiss
Watching Alix struggle to bake things is my new favorite thing. I love her!
This is the longest behind tasty I wonder why
I like when she do videos ❤
"I don't know where I already went wrong"
me: " americans can't all be that bad" american: *calls pain au chocolat a chocolate croissant* me: okay maybe I was wrong
every french speaker or british person is so confused at the "chocolate crossiant" thing...we say pain au chocolat lmao
SHE IS SO FREAKING BEAUTIFUL. SHE IS ALSO LIKE POSITIVE AND IF SHE DOESN'T SUCCEED SHE TRIES AGAIN😀
is this why handmade crasoints are expensive
Does tasty and yummy are the same they do look the same
T H I C C
Shorty cute
lmfao
But all the food they throw away though... not good.
I love this girl so much. She always has a great smile on her face.
I love her laugh it’s so cute
Those some big croissants
She’s so pretty in and out ❤️
Just give that girl her own show, she’s amazing
Is that croissant or pain-au?
Wasting food again smh.... >_>
I'm trampled ! guys these are called "pain au chocolat" not "chocolate croissant"... At least call our pastries what we named them
Thats a damn PAIN AU CHOCOLAT
I love it😆
She’s so adorablee
Does no one read the description?
Awww she has the sweetest smile!! omggg <3
*so much internet to do*
Why not just buy croissant dough?
Y'all should make more behind the scenes
Why is BuzzFeed so proud that their employees who's job is to make food content are completely ignorant of how to cook?
Hannah: Oh my God, they look Amazing  Alix: 😂😂😂 It's butter  (Meanwhile)  Me: (LMFAO) 😂😂😂😂😂
I love girls who can cook
7:19  Me when my crush said he likes me.
I know there's a camera above her but why does she look up so much?
They are called pains au chocolat, it’s french
She's my FAVORITE tasty producer😍❤
omg alex is literally so beautiful her smile makes her shine like a star!! this sounds so cheesy but im serious about that😍⭐️
they.are.PAIN.AU.CHOCOLATS
She knew she was going to be baking and wore all black?? 😂
"I don't claim to be a good baker"  -Alix
And this is the problem with Tasty recipes. The average household cannot afford to screw up as many times as this.  Tasty recipes are more miss than hit. Find a better channel.
Alix has to have her own show.
I love her, she's so funny😂😂
Shade 😂
I SPOT A SCOTT
Need more air conditioner
Never Give Up!!!!!!!!!!
When She Wear Does Shades She Does Looks Like Corine From Thread Banger
Shes so bad
How is she not frustrated??? lol i wish i can be as positive as her
she cazy 🤣🤣🤣🤣 love it 😘😂
Lmaoo she is crying and she did it yay
THeY aRe Pain aU chOcOLAte
Alix is literally the sole reason why I’m subscribed to Tasty
And thats why I buy them because I am NOT going to wait that long and do all these things 😉
Why do americans never respect how to pronounce a foreign word the right way?
In Australia they're called Chocolate crossaints so stop. Also I tried it and they're delicious!
ALEX VS. DOUGH
It is called pain au chocolat because it is such a PAIN in the ass, just kidding 😆
Hi
oh my goooooood these are not chocolate croissant like in France that doesn’t even exist. It’s called Pain au chocolat or Chocolatine
Love the editing
This is seriously my favorite behind tasty video
Fucking hell we get the point she called them the wrong thing
I will now always be sceptical of their recipes after watching these and won’t worry if it doesn’t go right first time!
*pain au chocolat
The fisrt time when I make it.. its was like.. hell nah.. please.. no more.. ahahaha
Who else had the impression that they always got it right the first time
Ohhh my lanta, she is sooo freakin cute! Please keep her forever 😍
I call those pain a chocolate
Ooooo lala
Ooooo lala
I'm Alex but dam she beautiful 💃
It's not a croissant and that's not how you pronounce it, apart from that cool. Also why don't they just hire a baker for 2 hours to show them  how to do stuff? Whouldn't it more cost efficient
These are "pain au chocolat", this is how you call them in French
Omg she‘s so cute❤️
Crossiants are thicc and cute 😍
Rierie on the baackkk!!!
You are so amazing...love it...u were salt n pepper of the video
I really like how tasty isn’t all like pro bakers. It really shows how pretty much anyone can bake.
I watch this video whenever I need inspiration to get a tough job done. You're amazing, Alix! I hope there are more Behind Tasty videos featuring you!
2:20 that is precisely what she said
I am 13 years old and I want to work at tasty when o grow up !
That's y u always go to Starbucks to get em ;)
I LOOOOOOOVE, ALIX!! So beautiful and such can-do attitude in the kitchen~ YOU inspire me!
Not everybody knows what a pain au chocolat is so probably thats why they used chocolate croissants at the header so that people would actually click it.
WE NEED MORE ALEX ON TASTY
Did I heard her right? Butter will melt and create CO2?
I love her so much and the sunglasses part
i wana work here 😣😣😣
pretty cute and beautiful.. i can make here my wife ;)
They sell this at petrol stations in my country I didn’t know it’s this hard to make 😂😂😂
Ooohhhh alex..😍
That's a chocolatine lol
wow it looks so easy in the video.. just 1 min.. meanwhile it actually takes 10 days.. that's what you call recipe porn! giving us normal people way high unrealistic expectations :)
I’m gonna sound like a goddamn idiot for saying this, but I thought those were giant croissants in the thumbnail.
Good job! :) :D
The appropriate name is "Pain au chocolat" or "chocolatine" depends where you going in France :)
Jeez
I can see your panties alix at 7:19
Audio is clipped
I love her already and this is my 2nd video of her❤
Everyone is complaining that shes calling them croissants and Im just here thinking about how awesome Alix is.
Not crosswinds
Stupid auto correct it's CROSSAINTS
I make crosswinds, not chocolate ones lmfao
lol croissants are not easy to make- c'est pas facile
Technically that is not a croissant (french meaning crescent) but a pain au chocolate (french meaning chocolate bread)
so jolly😁
I died when she kicked that door open with those glasses on 😂
Thats a tasty looking Quwasohn
2:16 lol 2:24 what is rie doing?
Shade Shade *Shade*
She's cute
I love all the videos she does ❤️❤️❤️😂
Thicc
the glassesssssss NOOOOO lol
Here is a good example of how to be fat and like-able. Take note amy schumer.
Marry me!!!
I love alix
I love you her so much! Her personality is dabest
Lmao, shes so funny. I wanna be friends with her! She needs her own reality show! Lolol
, m,
Actually, I'm French and it's called "Pain au chocolat" 😜
I love her! ☺️
she’s so funny lol
Awww she's adorable
Alex is the funniest tasty producer 😂😂😂 I could watch her all day
Three days to make and twenty seconds to devour
You got to admire her dedication
She is soo cute
7:19 pause
2:23 look at the chef in the back
you're right. too much internet to do...
Well time to go to the store and buy some chocolate croissants
7:19, thank me later
*IM SO PROUD OF HERRR!!*
I feel the struggle
Umm I just ate chocolate croissant 🍫 🥐
she is extremely hot, I'm shook
pleeeaaasee hire some people who actually know how to bake. I  appreciate that they show her mistakes and stuff but she is doing almost everything completely wrong.
It's a pan-o-chocolate
50% saying thats its a pains au  chocolate  25% I could of dropped my crossont meme 25% saying she is cute
All this and u can buy them ready to roll from the shop lol
Aren’t they called pan au chocolat — i am from Manchester uk btw
IT's like she didn't even read an actual croissant recipe before trying this. I'm annoyed.
So today I'm gunna be making a chocolate acr-  *Sees the words on Alix's singlet* AHAHAHAHAHAHA
Inspired by her patience and perseverance 😍😍😍😍
Her dress is way to short.
make jar cakes!!
omg she's so beautiful, i deadass love her
I don’t understand why don’t they don’t just get a real pastry chef to make them
I lost it when she came out wearing shades. I was like yeeees finally gurl
Alex is soooo damn sweet
She is the cutest at buzzfeed
i'm loving her and these videos!!! pls keep them coming
Alix is pretty
ALIX WHOOP WHOOP!!!!!
Was that claire the same one from Bon Appetite
You, non French people, will never be bothered by the war we have in France: Pain au chocolat vs. Chocolatine. Two different names for the same thing, chocolatine being used mainly in the South West France (Bordeaux, la dordogne, red wine, canard confit, pommes de terre sarladaises et foie gras, I know you know it).  (I'm ok with both names, but chocolate croissant is a bit cursed though)
***Pain au chocolat!! Not chocolate croissant. The shape is wrong.
Here let me add Some MAN MILK to make it nice and Creamy Chocolate for you Bitch!  HIT THAT👌
I want to marry her!!!
in quebec they are 'chocolatines' sounds way better
OMG I'd love to be friends with Alix she's so funny and lovable ❤❤😂
What is you melt butter and chocolate set it and put it in between
She is so pretty
This is the worst video I’ve watched in my entire life
She's so cute and sweet 😍😍💕
Why is 7:34 so me after I get done making cookies
When she walked out with sunglasses it gave me life 😂😂😂
Why does Buzzfeed (and other youtubers, too) play the Nutcracker Suite as background music in videos? It's such a beautiful piece of music and using it for background music that has nothing to do with the actual piece makes it seem less special.
“That looks amazing” “it’s butter” I died
C'est un PAIN AU CHOCOLAT ! not a fucking "croissant"....
7 19
Love her
croissants no thay are pan au chocolate
What’s she looking up at
The awkward moment where you spend several days making chocolate croissants but you are actually making pain au chocolat...
SHE IS TOO CUTE
😍  she’s so sweet and bubbly and pretty😍😍
Can't you use puff pastry nvm they are not croissants
They make it look so easy and fast in their videos and little did I know there struggling as mush as I am
I would love to work on tasty
Why does someone who "isn't a good baker" and hasn't tried the recipe before make an instructional video on baking?
Those aren’t chocolate croissants please call the the right name atleast
I wish I tried as hard at school as she tries to bake
When she walked out with the sunglasses on I just imagined before she walked out she’s just yelling SOMEONE GET MY SUNGLASSES THESE THINGS WORKED OMG
she should have her own channel
Hey tasty could please have a job, I have zero cooking experience!!
She has a great smile
They’re called “pain au chocolat” , not chocolatine, not croissant au chocolat not chocolate croissant.
7:19 you’ll thank me later 😍
Why don't you simply look the internet for a recipe with all the tips and tricks regarding laminating and folding and stretching the dough.. Rather than pretending not having a clue.
5:10 I THOUGHT THAT WAS CLAIRE FROM BON APPETIT
She's so pretty😍🙈
I like going to tasty place😭where are the tasty place pleas😭💕
I really like her! She is so funny haha
oh lord ur so funny XDXDXD this is me BAKING EXACTLY
4:44 who is that fine specimen
it’s called a pain au chocolat you sick fuck
This is a joke right? Like you can Google it and know that you need a yeasted dough not a rough puff...
She’s so relatable , she looks all good and dressed up the first 2 days and after that she stopped trying. Me on the first few days of school😂
French people CALM DOWN!!! Here in the USA alone, we call the same thing by different names and that’s *okay* ... have you ever heard of a Coca-Cola? Well in the USA we call it: “soda,” “pop,” “coke,” “soda-pop,” etc...
I HAVE SO MUCH FREAKING RESPECT FOR YOU GURL! 👏🏼👏🏼🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
At 7:25 I was thinking like imagine if she tripped... then 10 seconds later it happened... lucky they didn't fall lol... and I too made croissants one time... never again lol
Team Chocolatine! #Québec
she looks like nikkitutorials without the excess makeup
shes so pretty!!! I love her!!
Quackson!
They were a real PAIN...
PAIN AU CHOCOLATTTTT
I am English and I live in America but they are definitely called pain a chocolat
I want to be a tasty producer!
Aren’t they pain au chocolat’s
Why aren't we using puff pastry????
Uhm, guys, it said in the description that this is Pain Au Chocolat.
LOVE her personality!
C'est des ptn de pains au chocolat uuuugh oh mon Dieu
7:20 me walking in front of my haters after the unexpected unbelievable win😎😏
i love their videos and content and all but i get so sad thinking about how much ingredient they're wasting :(
It is not a croisant but rather a "pain au chocolat" (and worst of all don't ever call it a "chocolatine")
I like my tasty girls bbw. The type to make a chocolate croissant and eat the up with you
I'm a baker and I make these things every day. It's so simple (past the dough part that is) that the details really matter. I've been making these for 8 years and I think I've made it perfect twice.
Shes adorable oml wife me up
It disturbs me how she wastes. The ingredients 😭
Is itjust me or doesshe look a bit like emilia clarke
i love her!!!
I'm not going to correct you because they're not croissants. Because like 1000 people already did that lol. But as a pastry chef, let me just say, you did great:) trial and error Alix! Keep it up sweety:)
She is LILLY from CLEVVER news doppelgänger!!
Well, she failed because she made pain au chocolat, not chocolate croissants
This is a pain au chocolat, croissant are like that:🥐
alex  is THICC thoe
she's so gorgeous😻
She scratched behind her ear than shared her food she made lol ew
how come there's no such thing as chocolate  croissant dough?
Butter melting does not create CO2  lol it's the water evaporating into steam that creates the air pockets
It looks shop bought :/
She IS a tasty producer.
Devil Child: boo Me STAWPP I COULDA DROPPED MAH croissant
I love everyone on Tasty but my favorite person is Alix one of the Tasty producers
The fact that she is always missing the point with the Butter makes me cringe real hard
it's funny of you guys call them chocolate croissant (and they do not look like croissant btw) and we just call them "pain au chocolat" which literally translates to "bread with chocolate "  :)

Personality magnificence and madness and tiredness for conceiving😍

You need to make it triangle
Alix is thicc and I'm loving it
Excuse me are you gonna finish that CUUUASAUNT

Watching YouTube on how to make these would have majorly reduced your time
bro i love her
I wish alix was mine so baddd😍😍she is so adorable😻
The poor girl needed a bench scraper 😂 why'd they let her suffer like that!!
Not fucking chocolate croissants. Name it correctly. Either you join the fight between pain au chocolat or chocolatine either you don't name it ! #triggered
Why does it look like firewood
I LOVE HER THE SHADES
J'avais une de ces envies de meurtres quand elle avais pas mis le beurre mdr
Croissant means crescent these weren’t crescent they were more like a pain au chocolat
I LOVE her personality!!!😍

She is sooo beautiful❤️
She's pretty and funny. Love from  Guyana
Did anyone else notice that the chocolate she put in looks so different from the one that was in the pains au chocolat in the last shot?!
The people that were clapping had no idea what they were clapping at

pro-tip put the marble slab in the fridge/freezer for a few minutes a head of time to help keep everything cold.
Try pounding out the dough before rolling it.

So people really watch this just because she is funny ( she is not at all in my opinion ) although she does not know ho to bake/cook. World is over.
I MADE puff pastry from scratch, and I almost killed myself lmaoooo

THESE ARE NOT CROISSANTS THESE ARE PAIN AU CHOCOLAT  D A M N

Alix is so cute!
Terrible video, holy shit

7:19 WARNING
she's so pretty
Oof
She needs her own show on FoodTV
They're actually called pain au chocolat!
I feel better for failing now
When she walked out with that sunglasses at the end, I just burst out laughing. Feeling proud for her, tho. I just know the feeling of accomplishment after so many times trying and redoing things just for one goal. But I also thought, "It would be hilarious if she trips because of the sunglasses...breads flying all over the place..." And then she really tripped! 😂😂😂😂😂  Luckily for her, no flying bread~ 😜😆😜😆
7:20 OHMYGO😂😂😂😂
4:34 IM YODELING OMG😂😂😂😂😂
I love how everyone is cal behind her and doing their own thing and she’s freaking out 😂😂
still mispronounced croissant. and also still they're not croissants/crescents. just chocolate breads/pains au chocolat.
Thats why i buy mine from sams club.
How funny would it be if she dropped all of em while coming out of the kitchen 😂
Don’t rent an apartment from Craigslist.  You’ll either end up with a racist landlord, or a sh-ithole place.
I did this it actually was not that hard
It's not crisonat it's pano choclaied don't no how to spell
this is why jus-roll exists
5:02   Anyone notice that the song is the Periodic Table Song? xD
I'm so proud thfgvfto bxfndrgc
In france we call it « pain au chocolat » and sometimes « chocolatine »...
THOSE SHADES THOOO
Pain au chocolat ? Chocolatine?     *Chocolate croissant*
She's hot asf
Why is she so hot?

7:36 me in life😂
Everything on tasty videos seems to be pretty easy, but now we Know is NOT 😂😂😂
That's pain au chocolat ffs. Fun vid otherwise.
This is petit pain les croissants are like the shape the shape of the moon 🌒

I HONESTLY am very happy for her...

I love her! She so cute and chirpy and relentless....I would have cried after the first batch came out wrong. Thanks for showing us this side of tasty!
I hope she got fired this dumb bitch is a food producer? she can't make a good dough are they hiring dumb people!?
She’s sooooo beautiful
T H I C C
Thought it was pain au chocolate that’s what we say in britain
She has such a great body😍😍 love you😍

It's called pain au chocolat and in english  this translates to chocolate bread lol
You have to knead the dough before you rest it.
I LOVE BEHIND TASTY!
it's pronounced "kwassaw" not crassont
My nabs you nice
Niceeeee
Thank you Alex for your hard work, I was able to get them right on the first try due to your hard work lol
Rie ever is the solution
Nice
The thumb nail does not look like a croissant it looks like a panel shocker la
i wanna be a tasty producer 😍
lol i didnt know it would take that many trial and error....respect for her....and my local baker
Can I just ask... how was she hired again for tasty? XD
I LOVE ALEX!!!!! SHE ADORABLE!!!!!
Lol best vid ever
You should have cut your doe into triangular shapes then rolled them up for a more authentic look of the actual bake good.
those are called pain au chocolat not croissants :P but they turned out beautiful!
she reminds me of a mix between Emilia Clarke and Jennifer Lawrence
U r the cutest baker 😘.. and the best u didn't give up 👌👌
Imagine how hot this girl would be if she wasn't fat.
it is a PAIN AU CHOCOLAT.......why do so many people, even in this century, get it so blatantly wrong.....i am simply flabbergasted, but not in the right way....and yes she is really funny and charming,
She is one of my favorite people in the world 😍
Yay!  You did it.. looks delicious or masarap in Filipino. #TastyFanFromPH 😄😄😄
Ahhhhhh almost made me drop my croissant
She is; 1:funny  2:kind 3:Not on a diet🍫 Because she ate it no hate because I ain't talking about her way and weight🎤😎
Lol didn't she say she was on a diet!?🍔🍕🍟🍗🍫🍰🎂🍪🍩
Lovin Alix!
Not croissants more like little pies
Thicc
I just watched a few Tasty videos... i learned that i should not give  up after a single fail.
Bitch those are chocolate aux pain That was french I’m Canadain
Just saying its pronounced kwuh-sant
I wonder where all the food they make go?
In France we call it Pain au chocolat, so that would be chocolate bread and not croissant😅
Teach us how to make pettui gettuis
I kept thinking of that vine and then she tripped like "You almost made me drop my croissant!!"
All y'all crossaint fucking enthusiasts in the comments need to be quiet. Like it's just a shape.
In the background Rei looks so confused
my aunt makes chocolate crossaints
I'm french and those aren't chocolate croissant but pain au chocolat or chocolatine for some.
Their call pan a chocolate get it right
Wasting time !!!! Nothing
In france we call this "pain au chocolat". Listen and learn from ur sensei
tHAT IS PAIN au chocolat MISS
Is it just me or does Alix remind you of Trisha Paytas
I love it when another lady come and ended with never again.
Are you gonna finish that......       *C W O I S S A N T*
She's wasting ingredients. Droppin some asian comment here. Lol
7:26 Hahahahahhaha
Alex is GEORGOUS! She needs to be in all the new videos... I would love to take her out.
It's  "pain au chocolat " not croissant..
They are *pain au chocolat*  Croissant means crescent 🌙
Behind the scene is the best 😂❤️
Why are they wasting so much food??
David hasn't made these chocolate croissants (or pain au chocolat,  sorry I don't know French) yet, but he can't escape his destiny forever.
Looks like a cool job!
it made me so uncomfortable w/ the amount of stuff she wasted, but it’s still a good video!
I want to marry Alex 😍
Stupid 'Americans its Crossiants ( qwa son)   Also fun fact crossiants and pan au chocolat originated in Austria not France and were sold to France in the 1800s
pls dont use the Lord's name in vain
I love Alex
isn't tasty supposed to be a channel to "teach" people how to cook/bake? but the person who makes the video doesn't even know how to cook/bake?
Did i just fall in love?
DAVID WE KNOW YOU'RE AVOIDING IT
Anyone else love Alex’s attitude
Its called Pain au chocolat or chocolatine, say chocolate croissant here in France and we’ll probably send you back 😂😂
It s not a croissant chocolat but un pain au chocolat or chocolatine
Yummy
please make macaroons
She is super cute and funny. Reminds me of our Maria Goretti...
everybody is like...   could i fuck that?
Next time make them with iced chocolate custard
QUACKSON!!!
Why do you americans need to mess up french pastries names ALL THE TIME ? Please do a minimum of research :'(
I just realized I just watched this on Pinterest and it was the same exact one 😂😂
she cute
I just want David to do this
These are fukkin pain au chocolat not "chocolate croissants" lmao
She is my favourite Tasty producer 😂
THESE BEAUTIES R CALLED PAIN AU CHOCOLAT NOT CROISSANT AU CHOCOLAT BLBLA GO FUCK YOURSELF
These aren't croissants, they're pain au chocolats, bread with chocolate. Croissants are croissants becuase of their shape which is a crescent. Croissant literally translate to crescent.
Wait don’t wanna sound dumb but why is the wine mom from buzzfeed there
She had hand prints on her butt
They are called pain au chocolat...
It's my dream to work at TASTY
I would like to notify, that as a french person, that is called a "pain au chocolat"
Stahp, i'm gonna drop my croissant
She is so beautiful😍
She’s adorable!
She kind of look like Clair from Heros
Mmm... looks good. She does too 😏
Thats a napolitana de chocolate xD
She's beautiful 😊
I am sorry , but i couldn't help it I am thirsty 7:19
Thicc
I ...I..think I'm in love with her...   awkward!!!
I love how much the people of tasty care about camera and quality that they check the camera constently
She thiccccccc
Don't read the comments on the actual video, they are full of flame wars on wether it's called pain au chocolat or chocolate croissants. Im Muslim and apparently if your Muslim your a brainwashed fuck for calling chocolate croissants "pain ah chocolat" Edit: according to *some people*
Really made my day😂
7:20 she looks like clarke from the 100
Actually it's called ''pain au chocolat'' in France. I know, I'm annoying.
That's not a croissant guys 😅 it's called Napolitana
It’s a pain au chocolat
I loved how you lived it out....I am totally loving your spirit and endurance 😍
2:18 oh I wonder how that could have happened
How to be a tasty producer?
I mean this in no sexual way but you are down right gergous.
Lol 😂 I’m so happy you finally got it cause I’m was frustrated for you 😂
she is thicc
ILY ALIX😊☺😁!!
"I'm a tasty producer" cannibals on high alert.
Take a shot every time you see a "it's called Pain au chocolat" comment 😂
We’re does all this wasted food go, the bin?
Really enjoy her videos
2:15 rolling pan ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  and 2:20

Chocolatine.
PAIN AU CHOCOLATE!!!! AHHH
The ad was a ham and cheese sandwich 😂
Chocolate croissants are called PAIN DU CHOCOLAT
She's cute
ALIX IS SO CUTEEEEEEE
*Pain Au Chocolat
I like her personality so muchhh
Woman, you're my spirit animal in cooking. 😂👍🏻
I would marry her.
Why is this me 😂😂💀
Why does the behind the scene vid have 2.8 mil views and the actual recipe video has 800k views
She is very pretty and hot
She’s so cute
I want to work for tasty. Buzzfeed, in four years, hit me up.
IT LOOKS LIKE A BISONS PENIS
😂😂😂😂😂
Idk why this is so funny😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
She has such a nice and positive personality😇😇😆😍
Drink every time she smiles I dare you
When Rie goes "ohh" lmaaao
I love the behind the scenes do more of them
She looks like Gillian bower like if you think 🤔
Hey maybe throwing the dough out like a slab of clay would work? It's the same premise basically.
She is so kind and sweet with fuuny jokes😂❤
She is a 10/10 by my book. Oh if only I could know her...
Tasty producers are ignorant af
You could at least use the correct name. It would be liké calling à hamburger à meat sandwich. It's à pain au chocolat or chocolatine on the south west of france
I love her hair color
Alex is so hot :)
she is the cutest!
Disclaimer: she spoke too soon
This is  making me hungry........
this was done so incorrectly holy shit   sincerely,  a concerned culinary student
PAIN AU CHOCOLAT PLEASE
Now u know how we feel when we try 🤣🤪😂
I like her!!
Does anyone noticed that the final croissants were black from the bottom? They burnt.
Alex looks like Anastasia Steele's best friend from the fifty shades of grey.
But these aren't chocolate croissants. Chocolate croissants are croissants that have chocolate in them. They made pain au chocolat.
U are so funny! By thr way as u walked I was like: hopefully she won't fell or the croissants wont be end up on the ground😂
Im so sorry but when she said. the layers look so good... i was like... oh no the layers look so bad😂😬.. and trust me i know what im talking. But shes a really sympathetic person and did her best.. even she did not research the thing with the butter earlier (sorry if my english isn't perfect)
This is a little cringe to watch.. since i'm a pastry chef. xD Also for anybody wanting to know a "chocolate croissants" is more commonly known as Pain au Chocolat, the word "croissant" refers to the shape (crescent) so Pain au Chocolat is the correct name. Just a little info in case you go to France and ask for a chocolate croissant and they don't know what you mean or ask if you mean a Pain au Chocolat then you wont be confused :)
A tip for people wanting to make puff pastry , smack the crap out of it with the roling pin to break it down😊 that will make it easier to roll out
I'm watching Rie in the background the whole time just begging her to come and fix this mess
she seems like that person everyone likes.
You’re supposed to knead the dough more until smooth to create more gluten and help create nice buttered layers at the end. Thin out the butter slab before you put it in the chilled dough, so it’ll be easier on you when you roll it out and laminate it. I do rectangular shapes for both the butter slab and the dough. The butter slab has to be about a half size of the dough. Place the slab in between the dough like you do 3 folds and making sure you seal the top and bottom sides. Proof them until they’re doubled in size. Your fifth time wasn’t too bad though. It took me twice to get right. I use my own technique and It’s not that hard actually. You just have to be discipline with the time on the dough during resting time, laminating and proofing. You put your passion in it, you’ll do great one day and I warn you, it can be pretty addicting making these croissants once you master the technique. I’m a pastry chef and taught myself everything on pastries from puff pastry to the most delicate and finicky ones to make and it’s been fun!
5:41 you’re welcome
Can it be called a croissant? It doesnt have the typical shape of one and looks like a puff pastry with a chocolate filling.
Alex so funny love the she never give up
I love Alex oml
Pain au chocolat*
Why is my doe so janky😂😂😂
I remember seeing this tasty video and thinking who the hell is crazy enough to make these? Way too much work
v nice but that’s called a pain au chocolat or a chocalatine (depends where you are in france)
She is a hot mess
Is Alyx single? Because like a 3 star Michelin restaurant, I would move to date her.
They look like pan u chocolates
it's called fucking chocolatine!!!!
she  T H I C C
She looks like Emilia Clarke
She’s beautiful💜
She is fat
millennial speak with the voice raise at the end, fucking hate it!!!!!!!
I remember in the actual video people kept commenting bad stuff about how this'll take forever and it's not even worth it.... and now I feel really bad for her cause she gave the video a lot of time and energy
I love Alix lmfaoo she’s so funny
Use DRY BUTTER instead of regular butter so it doesn't melt! :-)
I’m British and we call chocolate chroisants pan aue shockola
CHOCOLATE CROISSANT ?!?!?
lady the blonde...she seems so happy person... great cook...I want one...i will make one day Thanks
What a goofball!
Anybody have her social media handle? You know for research purposes 🤗🤗✊🏾
I love watching her she’s so pretty💓💓
those are pain au chocolats....... chocolate croissants........what
They look exactly the same as shop-bought ones. Not saying they are i think it is good they look like shop-brought ones
t h i c c c c c c c c O-O
She’s adorable!  I love this - THIS is reality 😂
7:20 I laughed so fucking hard!
3:24 Elsa Rhae?
Well, whatever it’s called, I think she did great and they look delicious
Rie throwing that shade be like,calm down plz 😑
She puts on sunglasses, two minutes later she drops the plate
She is amazing, her confidence and brightness throughout the video and the comfy flow of positivity, she deserves a gold medal
She reminds me so much of Loey Lane!
She is so pretty she should be on camera instead of behind it
made croissants once and it took 8 DAMN HOURS. they tasted incredible but NEVER AGAIN
so much internet to do
Pan au chocolat??
The bakery in front of my house (literally) makes croissants every 2 days and it is delish! All of the bakery stuff tastes good in Germany ;3
Ok, this video made me mad! That’s a lousy tasty producer, how she got hired at buzzfeed??
What happened between 6:56 - 6:59 ?? Damn!!
Shes thiccc💦💦💦
I'm not that complicated. I see Alix in the thumbnail and I click.
I lived in France and mentioned wanting to make croissants and was quickly dissuaded from it- lol, apparently the bakeries have a machine to fold the dough over with the butter
So here’s the thing Yes i get a lot of entertainment from these and I love these behind the scenes vids But it also reeeeally makes me doubt the quality of their actual recipes.. like taking the tasty recipe from this girl who clearly did not know how to make them or just some other recipe online, the online one seems like it’d be better... love her but I’d like the recipes to actually be good lol if even the person making it can’t do it.. and also the fact that in the end they make it doesn’t make that a good croissant, it makes it likely a normal croissant
THATS A PAIN AU CHOCOLAT
Such a beautiful girl
I love Alix! she's so funny  😂 She should do more videos with her  doing the recipes like this one!!
She might be my new favorite person ever
Why do people keep saying making Croissants is so hard? I've made them about 10 times, starting when I was 17, and never had a problem with a batch...
Lol best behind the scenes of tasty video everrrrr!
PAIN AU CHOCOLAT
*How to make pan au chocolat
that last scene lol haha
french people watching these being called croissants....  they're not croissants
Soo lucky they get to eat every single thing they make !!
It’s not a "croissant" you made a "pain au chocolat "
I love this lady. 😂
😂😂😂
Actually those are pain au chocolats. Croissants have a crescent shape whereas pain au chocolats have a cuboid shape. They look amazing though:))
Too Funny!!! Comic Relief. :-)
can she do a collab with Brad Leone from Bon Appetite?
please merry me but you have to get rid of my wife
tasty is like my dream job
When she said it has to be cold the whole time just make it in a meat looker
Favourite tasty producer
I love these videos more than the actual tasty videos
i love this bitch she look like trisha paytas idk she comforts me
T H I C C
comment section is annoying
Her smile tho
PAIN AU CHOCOLAT
Tasty has tasties!. Lol!.
Aren’t these pain au chocolat or am I dumb
Never quite master bread making in school it was THE hardest section, but u have to make love to the dough if u treat it like a side chick it will fail u every time!!! 😀
I need more behind tasty videos
Flour butt
Alix is really pretty
She is so so cute❤ You've no idea the positivity I get after looking at you  ❤❤❤KEEP GOING GIRL!  AND YES... YOU NEVER GIVE UP 😚😂🙌
you're like the nikkitutorials of America ahaha
Never making these
She seems so nicee
lol... that's what i hate about pastries the de-flouring process. I cheat by using a pasta roller.
thi- this is a pain au chocolate, not a chocolate croissant.
She looks like daenerys
How are homemade croissants so difficult and can ones like require zero effort whatsoever
She is so funny and clumsy I love her😇😇😇😇😇
Oml I love her
If she not cuffed cuff her ❤🔥😍😍😍
It’s a quakson
once my friend and i made croissants in three hours (no chilling overnight or anything), we made a complete mess with the butter, only chilled them for thirty minutes, but we still got nice flakes and i thought it was actually really fun
Can there please be more videos with her? She's awesome!
"I've earned these layers."  Are you an ogre?
Can someone tell me why American Butter is white?
When your connection so bad your downloads load
i want to see her work out routine, she has awesome legs
One of my favorite 😭
Rie with that shaaade
Alex X Brad Leone
Those aren't FUCKING chocolate croissant
Croissants aren't that hard to make, why are y'all making such a big deal out of it haha
At first I was like what am I watching... thought it would be like a normal how to make croissants video, and then I realized this is a video of me if I ever attempted this. Omg 😂 the determination was 👌🏻 you go girl! They look amazing!
It's not chocolate croissant it's Pain au chocolat !
Wow! Absolutely love your confidence. At the end you showed. Such a nice inspiration
Alix and brad from bon appetit are my faves
And why the hell did you change to a non rotatable handle rolling pin?? That's a recipe to disaster pastry dough (or heavy workout) LOL
As someone who likes to make pastry dough, this is hilarious lol
They're called pan au chocolat
On minute 7:20 you look like gordon ramsay doughter
I love Alex she needs to be in more videos! Tho...it could use more chocolate
7:29 when you finaly get rigth what you were trying for centuries, like the queen of bakery
Lovely lady but these are not croissants. They're pain au chocolat
There is no point in making croissants.  Make normal, daily meals.  Buy specialty items like croissants.
Your we’re making Pana chocolate’s it’s franchise and sound like pan-oo-choc-o-lates
I like the girl in Tasty.They are funny and fancy😂😄
PLEASE ON BEHALF OF EVERY FRENCH PEOPLE THIS IS NOT A FUCKING CHOCOLATE CROISSANT!!!!!! omfg it's a fucking PAIN AU CHOCOLAT/CHOCOLATINE (je veux pas de guerre team chocolatine VS pain au chocolat ^^')  Do you guys even know what kind of shape a CROISSANT is??? This DOES NOT look like a CROISSANT!! Please respect our food 😭 or don't eat it.
I like her xD
Is this not a pain au chocolat
Can you do a 100 layers challenge for puff pastry?
She is so pretty!
It’s called a Pain au chocolate not chocolate croissant. You guys should know this!
Lol 😅😅😅 honestly my first time making that croissant dough (attempt of making the pain au chocolat) it was looking like your first attempt to make that deliciousness. But practice makes everything happen and it shows within the video that patience clearly pays off. 😊good job...
But that's not a croissant
White is unlucky for her whereas black did the magic....!!!!❤
She looks like Emilia Clarke
She is so frickin pretty
Is it just me or did her arm actually got smaller on the final day 😅😅
Amazing layers!😍
Damn ma, u thicker than the dough
She is HOT!
I showed my French friend this video named 'chocolate croissants' and he got SO triggered.
Yes to that hair flip 💁‍♀️
She is beautiful!!
THAT'S NOT A CROISSANT THAT'S PAIN AU CHOCOLAT
She reminds me of Emilia Clarke of game of thrones
7:18
I like her lol
French culture intelude: this isn't a chocolate croissant. It is a pastry on its own called pain au chocolat. The dough is made with less butter and it crumble much more easily than a croissant. Also it doesn't have the shape of a croissant. Kudos to her for trying so hard, chefs need an actual degree to master the art of a perfect croissant 👏🏻
she got some nice cakes back there #Beautiful
I love chocolate croissants .. do checkout my youtube channel as well 😊
i like her
It tastes really good!! It is time consuming but worth it.
She looks like emilia clark does anybody else thinks that too?
State farm back document clean problem concentrate ignore risk forever frame.
I love watching Alex's vids
She’s so pretty😍
Pain au chocolat.
At least learn how to pronounce “croissant” properly if you’re not going to call them by there proper name (pain au chocolat)
PAIN AU CHOCOLAT
Fucking hell how stupid can you get they are not croissants they are chocolatine/pain au chocolat
there not called Chocolate Croissants there called pain au chocolat
She's so happy and positive :)
M A X I M U M T H I C C
‘Chocolate croissants’ are Americans to lazy to call them pan au chocolate?
quackson
alex put some shit on those chapped ass lips
Honestly the behind the scenes videos are my favourite!
Shit! Her body is banging hot!
6:57 the smile when you know you pass in one time.
Ohh hoo ..yess..😀
Lol Rie shading is so funny.
so you get paid for 9 days to just make some chocolate croissants... sounds like a dream job tbh
You know what would have been funny if she was walking and then trip and drop all the croissant
She’s def my favoriiiite
These are called 'pain au chocolat'. C'mon, Tasty, do your homework before calling it 'chocolate croissants'.
shes sooo cute
I love that girl.. I wanna marry her @buzzfeed I hope i can meet her.
I love how she's so bubbly and good vibes only! she's so cool!
Never give up !
Who else needs to see more of Alexis?
I love her, she’s hilarious
Make more behind the scenes
Aren’t they pain au chocolat?
If you’re a food expert you should know it’s pain au chocolat 🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️
C W O S S A N T
I love these types of videos from her
Congrats on your weight loss, you look awesome.
I want to be a tasty producer because I watch these videos, love them, and love to cook and bake.
Great episode. I have such a crush on her😸
Why is the mic quality so shit
Why did she grate the butter into the dough? That's like how you make biscuits lol.
jesus fuck I love her
It's actually paîn au chocolat. Chocolate croissant is incorrect because a croissant is a rolled, crispy pastry, so if you were to say chocolate croissant you would incorporate chocolate flavoring/cocoa powder into the dough.
ngl i made successful puff pastry dough when i was 14, it wasn’t this insanely hard to make either 😂
I love when Alex does videos. It makes me feel like my cooking mistakes are normal. Also, it makes me feel like I’m in the kitchen with one of my best friends. Give us more Alex! 💕
pain au chocolat.
I Love her voice😍😍😍
This is my new favorite show lol
In France, this is not something you’d make at home. It’s a profession and you buy them at a bakery.
Dammmn looks good ..not the bread the girl
u need a bread and butter dough and laminate it
Me afffffff
You can see her vag when she kicks open the door
do Americans call them chocolate croissants?
Pain au chocolat.
My mom can make anything and she's not a cook, but this gal who works at tasty *HER JOB* can't... that's sad
Love her. Please make more behind the scenes with Alix😘😘
They are pan au chocolate
Eso es una napolitana no un croissant de chocolate
*SHE THICC*
Its *PAIN AU CHOCOLAT* not a croissant
I'm sorry but she and Matty Matheson would be perfect for each other.
I don’t know if this is just in Britain and France but we call them pain au chocolat pronounced pan oo chocolate
Pain au chocolat
Gosh, it's so stressing to watch. 😣
DAVID SEYMOUR WHERE ARE YE
She looks exactly like my friend, Southeast Asian version of her XD
Lol
SHE'S SO CUTE
the pastry of the croissants consist in multiple layers of dough and butter, not the butter and the dough together, so when you bake it the butter melts and the layers of dough gets crispy and separated.
Im so proud
Hmmmm no proofing? Rookie 😑
She didn't fold the dough correctly
PAIN AU CHOCOLAT
pains au chocolat svp
But...that's a pain au chocolat...
PAIN AU CHOCOLAT
Love herr!!! I need a whole playlist of just her talking
On my birthday
9 whole days and not once did she manage to call them by the correct name.
Those honestly look like pain au choclat
Wow a lot of things and cameras to edit the videos
Do people not call these ‘pain au chocolat’?
That's pain au chocolat not chocolate croissant.
I just love her. Please keep making these with Alex! She's beautiful and a joy to watch! Her energy is lovely.
I just love that Rie is just in the side calming doing her thing
The part which inspires me the most it's that she never gave up and kept on trying until she got it.😊😢😍
She’s hella cute
These r fun to watch ! Can u make more shit 🤗🤗
I don't understand why you would try croissants for the first time ever while trying to make a tutorial
You should've watched this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7zdYKn2RJo (you needed to cut them into triangles, that's why you were so off with the shape)
She’s so pretty!
make macaroons!!
How do you get a job with tasty? It looks fun.
I hate to be this person... but they're not croissants. They are pain au chocolat
I love her energy!!
Keep it up....lots of love for u....another video....👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Make something else then chocolate croissant
It’s called a pain au chocolate
ITS PAIN AU CHOCOLAT OR CHOCOLATINE NOT CHOCOLATE CROISSANTS 😡
Pain au chocolat
ok if you stop at 7.19 and put your video speed on 0.25 you'll see something
i'm never making croissants
These videos are my life..... I think
7:20 that badass moment when you did something cool. So classy 😎
She reminds me of emilia clarke ☺️
Hire me.
I am in love with her ❤️
*buys Pillsbury croissant 🥐 dough in can and just stuff with chocolate. Lie to all your friends and say they’re home made. * you’re welcome lol
Omg I’m eating a chocolate pastry from panera right now
This video make me want to work at/for  Tasty even more then I already want to. 😫😫😫
Why does every blonde have the same laugh?
It's called panachocolat......
Awesome video. Great job. I too want to make croissants. Thanks for all the tips
ok but why is everyone at tasty an executive producer
you need to laminate the dough by making a square of du
you need to laminate the dough by making a square of du
They look great but they're pain au chocolats not croissants
Loved this. Didn’t realize how difficult it was to make crescents.
All the scenes are literally different, there is no continuity and so makes viewers question what has actually happened. In close up had 2 separate bits of choc, and she baked it with 1. Also when she walked in there was some already baked ones on the table. This is not the first video I have spotted these errors
She is so cute
her great personality makes up for her not being skinny.
Is it wrong I love watching her fail?
*pain au chocolat
I love this girl, new gold nugget dug out from Tasty
I thought those were called pain au chocolat 😂 atleast where I’m from they call it that EDIT: welp my french was right in the first place that’s why i edited again
the butter is so white ???
She is so cute !
I feel like Buzzfeed could save themselves a lot of time and effort if they just had some real chefs/bakers do these videos...
I really really liked her and that video but.... Thats a pain au chocolat not a croissant.......
These kind of videos makes me cherish the tasty videos more
Did she say it like "quacksons?"
7:36 she could've dropped her croissant
Oh cool but this is not croissant , this is pain au chocolat....
😂
Hahaha the walk of proudness at the end 😂 I respect your determination
For some reason I love Rie
Alex is the best.
4:47 damn😍
Quackson
Omg she was adorable to watch and now I know I’ll never make a croissant 🥐
Alix is so Beautiful!! omg!.
MORE VIDEOS WITH ALIX PLEASE!!!😍😭
Girl when in doubt check Great British Bake Off! They have awesome tips for making croissants! Especially in a smaller time period!
pause at 7:19
pero like can you do a makeup tutorial 😍
Made croissants for a French project in h.s to impress my teacher. It worked , I just didnt sleep that night (or multiple nights) to get it done.   NEVER AGAIN
whisk up some heavy cream, milk, chocolate, and butter on low heat and then use that instead, because it will be more of a creamy chocolate than a candy-bar chocolate. and itll be better.
This chick is amazing. I love her!
Alex you are cute like a cat
*STAWPPP, I COULD HAVE DROPPED MY CrOsAuNt*
I'm so confused on how she got this job.
When she tripped she could’ve drop her croissant 🥐😂
Alix, I love you!
shes so beautiful. .i.love your ways and beautiful smile😂
Watch Yakitate Japan! You'll learn how to make incredible croissants.
This is why I buy frozen puff pastry...
Rie just staring in the back
They’re pan au chocolas
That’s a pain au chocolat??! Why are they being called chocolate croissants??
i love these videos with Alex is shes awesome and very funny and really really beautiful :)
THEY ARENT CROSSONTS THEY ARE PANE CHOCOLAT
Y'all mean pain au chocolat???
7:21 favorite part 😎
Alix is wifey material fo' sho'.
I love the behind the scenes thing please make more!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I hate to be a downer but I swear that's just a pana cholate
Okay but she is the cutest ever
HER LEGS IN THAT SHORT BLACK DRESS LOOK AMAZING UGH 😭😭😭😭😭
Oh my god I love her She seems so sweet and funny and ugghhh I wanna be friends with her!!
What’s her social media handles? Does she have any? Bc she’s cute lmaooo
Very yummy
Shes so cute and sweet . And thick too . Gf goals . LOL
If they're at buzzfeed they'll probably come out ;) 3:37
First of all its pain au chocolat
She fine
Alex is the best
Scott came!!
She is so friggin hot and she bakes! Some dude is going to score big if he can get a ring on it.
Shes so beautiful damn
An an european it hurts my soul that they call those croissants (just check out what the word actually MEANS) but this video made me happy ☺ sooo much work and such positive attitude!!
Ur suppose to lightly beat the dough with the rolling pin to soften it before rolling it out😊
Love her so much. Everytime when i watch Alix behind tasty video it is like watching me myself in the kitchen following a new recepie. hahahaha
she's so pretty
Watching this gave me flashbacks to culinary school when we all ended up with sore arms, abs and backs from rolling damn croissant dough all week. I recommend a long marble rolling pin, it stays cold and the weight helps it flatten.
Looks and personality-wise and wow even the way she sound reminds me of Candice aka The Edgy Veg.
She s so beautiful
Laughed so hard when she came out of the kitchen wearing an eyeglasses. 😂😂😂
There is so much more effort in it than it looks like in the final videoo goshh
She's back LOL she's hilarous. I love her attitude, quirkiness and persistence.
Make more Hot stuf.
This was way more satisfying than the videos where they just make it look effortless and then you feel stupid for not getting it in one go "like in the video." Its very cool to see they strugle too
Finally found my favorite BuzzFeed person
The moment she brought out the grater I knew she was in for a long journey. So glad she got it in the end!! I would've cried too if my croissants came out well hahaha. Croissants are easy to come across at our local bakeries, but the amount of time and effort required to make them is not.
The T in croissant is silent
As a French, hearing "chocolate croissant" makes me cringe so bad X'D IT'S A PAIN AU CHOCOLAT
I tried to make pakistani paties almost similar process as this and I tried to work on it for 2 days n then i gave up n threw it away ;^;  *NEVER AGAIN*
😂😂😂 please do more videos withe her!!! i love her positivity and she makes me laugh all the time 😍😍
Guys its really not that hard i got it on my first try.
Well, my school makes fresh croissants to buy for break. Never knew it was this much effort lol
These are called pains au chocolat 😊🌸
Now turn this videos into a 10second tasty video
is this some sortof a joke?
pAiN aU cHoColAt !!!!!
Well I'm omw to a bakery now. I don't even know where my local baker is xD
"Chocolate croissant" MAIS TU TE FOUS DE MA GUEULE ?!
I love watching alix’s behind the scenes! 😂😊💕
Chocolatine you mean? Chocolate croissant HAHAHHA
It's not a chocolate croissant. Croissants aren't that shape.  That is a pain au chocolat
i LOOVVEE making croissants ! it made me appreciate the people who made it manually without  a mixer .. the ones who already learned how to make them can finish it in one day .. exclude the overnight dough resting
Btw those are called pain au chocolat but "chocolate croissant" is kinda cute
She looks like Nikki tutorials
I'm so jealous at how positive she is. I'm currently at a low point in life and its hard getting back up. I feel better when I see people accomplish even the tiniest things 😄
My baby looking so good today
But that was not croissant!'
6:34 more TIT shakes
5:23 tit shakes
5:00 made my day (the tits )
We can just roll the dough and brush on the butter as we roll them in layers
Honestly i think I'd be a really good tasty producer 😂😂
the shadiness of this office lol
Think I'm in love. She's super beautiful and has the type of personality that just lights up a room.
Emilia Clarke.....?!?
she looks so sweet and nice. anyone woupd want her as best friend
Only came because of her
Ngl I legit ate one today for desert... What a coincidence
7:19 upskirt
I LOVE u Alix! ❤️🥐🥐❤️🥐❤️🥐🥐❤️🥐❤️🥐❤️🥐❤️🥐🥐🥐
They waste so much food on this show
She makes me laugh😆     So much
Omg I love her so much she should like try out for food network star
2 words: Thicc Goddess
She’s so pretty and she has like the best job. And she’s so cool. I want her to be my best friend. She seems like she has her shit together
I just love the attitude... go gurl
I made real croissants once and you are meant to fold layers of butter into the layers of the dough.
They aren't even croissants.. they're pain au chocolat lol.
“I’m gonna have a mental break down”.  Me too....
Cringe
Doesn’t the girl with blue hair work at buzz feed
What’s wrong Jimmy-kun? Could it be that you’re… craving my croissant??
God fucking dammit I'd rather you'd call these chocolatines like fucking Belgians rather than have you say "chocolate croissant" one more god damn time. Those are pain au chocolat, chocolate croissant are, y'know, fucking croissant shaped.
Im sry but these r not croissants they r pains
WHOS THE GUY AT 4:48 OMFGGGGG
How are u so sweet
That's not a croissant... It's a pain au chocolat - anyone else agree?
Not all heroes wear capes👏🏼

She is SOOO cute 😂😂 and funnyyy
She is gonna be famous
alix is so cute and pretty and is such a ball of sunshine!!!!! she's got nothing but good vibes. i love her personality and persistence. anyone would be lucky to have her!
How much grams are in that packet of yeast ? I want  to do it, but I don't know if the packet in my country came in the same amount 😅😅
she's mad cute
Ok she’s at a 10. We need to bring it down to a 3.
I love these behind the scenes of tasty, they are so good. It shows how hard these people work and that this cool videos take longer then people would expect. I love seeing these, keep it up ❤️
A R E  Y O U  G O I N G  T O  F I N I S H  T H A T  C R O I S S A N T ?

I‘m really craving some croissants right now😂
She's REALLY cute though!
All of that tasty food is starting to take a toll on her appearance. Just saying....
The butter is too white. In France our butter is yellow.
she's so cute she looks like emilia clarke
I LOVE HER

This is more "Pain au chocolat" than "Croissant", I'm french, I know my viennoiserie 😇😂

2:20 thats what she said lmao
Now that's what I call willpower Alix <3 <3
I love tasty because I want to try to make the recipes at my hpuse
i’ve learned cold butter from gbbo
In Britain we pronounce croissants ‘cwassons’ and we call chocolate croissants panochocolat
She looks like and acts like emilia clarke but fat but still beautiful
Tasty is the best channel ever!!!
She r thicc asf
shes so cuuuttteeee lol
TASTY PRODUCER: I do not claim to be a good baker.
Chocolatine
...hun. They are not chocolate croissants. It's called pain au chocolat- literally meaning chocolate in bread. Croissants are cresent shaped...
You did brilliantly. I’d have given up but shows hard work and perseverance works for some!
Can we just buy puff pastry and put the chocolate in and bake. And tadaaa...
Chocolat croissant do bot existe! Its "pain au chocolat" . Do some research before making a video about it you dumbass
Thiccc    So is the dough
These are FUCKING PAINT AU CHOCOLAT
0:40 juicy
Pain au chocolat?
Man, I stuffed my face with croissants when we visited Korea. Thanks for this recipe 😁
She's so cute and sounds like Lindsay Lohan
This is not a "Chocolate croissant", It's a "Pain au chocolat" ...
The best video
😂😂😂
I like to watch people suffering  :D
so hot.  the croissants too. good hard work done!
when alexis showed up i was so excited lol why am i her biggest fan ???
She’s the cutest, funniest, prettiest... she’s everything hahaha ❤️❤️ someone please give me her full name so i can follow her on instagram😂❤️
I loved how she just walked out of that baking room like a boss. Hahaha
I love this girl
In france its called Pain au chocolat
不脏的脏脏包
Does she realise that she has made pain au chocolat
7:28  She looks like Eliza Taylor SO much
"I think im going to have a mental breakdown" story of my life 😂
It’s called pain au chocolat 🤦🏽‍♀️
Show this to gordan ramsay
I want chocolate
the point is ... that is not a croissant, this a choclate bun
Pretty sure they are called Pain au chocolat or something. Probably the only time my French class had come in handy.
Pain du chocolate
I love you khaleesi
This is why the "behind the scene" even has more views than the actual video.
Still want her ig
AH You almost made me drop my croissant
Omg she looks like NikkieTutorials
Over where I live that is not a crossiant, we call it, pan de chocolate
she's cute hahah
This is my third time watching this video
I live alix she’s so positive and cute
4:42 SCOTTIE THE HOTTIE’S BACK
She's the cutest , need to see her more
Watching this after accidentally grilling my cake instead of baking it. Going to drop that cooking subject asap.
I love videos like this so much! (She is also super funny in the rainbow crepe cake video) Tasty makes recipes look too easy with their 1-minute videos. And I fail badly everytime when trying to reproduce it! haha
I see why people do this now
Isn't she the cutest
She got me at "Hi guys im alex im a TASTY producer" HAHA like and reply if you get it
They're not croissants tho
patetic
So proooooud of you, i know that feeling! :-*
I want to be friends with her lol
She's really cute
Why not just call it Pain au Chocolat and not Chocolate Croissant. It should be the actual name I swear, plus better marketing
Okay, so 1. She is gorgeous 2. She is funny 3. She is kind.  Like, do you have any issues or something ‘cuz I can’t see anything wrong about her.
you look like brooke nichole lee, an aussie actress from mako mermaids
I would have given up and cried... good job!
Oh no no no no no no. I'm so mad right now. These are not!!! Chocolate croissants. These are called chocolate breads. Chocolate croissants are lityerly croissants with chocolate in the middle. This isn't even shaped like a croissants how can you think that???
Love for Rie!!
"I have never made chocolate croissants"  I have. Here are the steps   Step one: go to Costco Step two: buy croissants from Costco Step three: buy nutella from Costco Step four: cut the croissant Step five: spread the nutella on the croissant Now you just put the croissant together and voila!  [Insert Tasty outro]
Jsuis épatée, je pensais pas qu’il y avait un pire affront que « chocolatine » mais les américains se sont surpassés. « Chocolate croissants », triste.
As a fluent French speaker I can say that you do not pronounce the « t » in croissant
Not to be a creep but i loveee her body😍
I think I love her hahaha
Stop at 7:19 let me know when u see it
LOVE HER!
I love her
I lOve how Rize is in The background
That’s a pano chocolat
Excuse me are you going to finish that CROISSANT
YES FINALLY A VIDEO ABT THE STRUGGLES THAT HAPPENS WHEN MAKING YOUR OWN DOUGH. usually cooking shows and other vids post video, and I always wonder how they make it look sooo easy
She reminds me of Emilia Clarke so much!
Do you even French
"I earned these layers and I'm proud of myself and that's a good accomplishment." -Alix   Now that I will quote you for.😊
Shut the fuck up criticizing them for messing up. All of us know that you can't even do 2 times better so the fact that you guys are hating is ridiculous.        You guys don't even have YOUTUBE videos but criticize Tasty for running out of ideas. Some people only have post notifications on to dislike the videos. You guys make no sense! It's good to know that tasty has atleast 1 loyal subscriber. You guys are so rude and feel like it's necisary to hate and that you'll die if you don't. In every single video, you guys are bitching about _Oh that's not from france_ or _That's not the name!_ You guys are petty.       If you're hating on someone that obviously means you have nothing better then to sit in front of a motherfucking screen all day sending hate comments. Shut the fuck up being rude to tasty and that's all.
Marry me Alix
Those are not croissants those are des petits pains au chocolat
You stupid morons!! Honestly, the tiniest bit of culture would allow idiots like you to understand it is called a GOD DAMN “PAIN AU CHOCOLAT”
I love this video
You go girl, and keep those layers coming! 💪🏼😄🙋🏻‍♀️
Why don't you just google how to make the dough?
Okay I'm not a tasty producer and I can fucking make this why do they try some stupid shit first and complain? Of course it wont roll if you leave it in a frige for a day. God
She looks like Trish
I thought the marble plate was a whole counter
please do more behind tasty, i fucking love them and they are addictive af
Honestly i cant count anymore how many times i played this video.. like give me a spirit and make me wont give up to reach my passion XD
Rnt u supposed put butter in middle
after watching the video of Alex in the test kitchen ....It makes me realise life is too short and do not need a mental break down.... Support my local bakery and buy them !!!!! WTG ALEX !!!!!!
Haays your so cute alix :)
Doesn't she look like nikki tutorial
Is the equipment named after famous chefs? :D
I’m not French at all, but everyone around me said that it pronounced “crosangs” like you don’t pronounce the T at the end so it kinda bugs me lmao I MAY BE WRONG.
I made this recipe. I have never wanted to cry while baking more. But it was worth it.
Hummm , de bonnes CHOCOLATINES
No wonder their recipes don’t taste good; they have no idea what they are doing. Maybe if they hired chefs, the food would taste better. Watching this video brought to mind the time that I made their honey garlic shrimp. I can hair imagine them saying while tasting their shrimp “oops, this has way too much ginger in it. Oh well the video is done; that’s all that matters”
I hate the way Americans say croissant
Those are pain au chocolat
I love this danish! I have filled a similar danish with an almond filling. So delicious!
these are called "PAIN AU CHOCOLAT", croissants are not made with chocolate
Girls not hot
7:18 I had to smile like that too!
This has more views than the actual croissant video
I LIKE HER
Put butterin each time roll
She is so sweet and funny!!! Plz more behind tasty videos with her!!!
This is pain au chocolat honey,  it’s not croissant
She a good thicc
pawg
She looks like Emilia Clarke ❤
You mean pain au chocolat? That's basically what that is
STOP! I COULD'VE DROP MA CROISSANT 😂😂😂😂👊🏻
Pain au chocolat
7:20 me when I graduate school
They are called pain au chocolat
Those aren't Croissants, they're neapolitans 😉
new dream job: a tasty producer
NO NO NO NO !!!! There is already a debate in France between calling that a "pain au chocolat" or a "chocolatine". (Pain au chocolat is the right one) So don't call that A CHOCOLATE CROISSANT or you're going to be killed by my entire population!!!!!
Made my day omg... love you girl
So proud of her! I went on this emotional journey with her!
Creamy chocolate pudding  https://youtu.be/Uutb5OkCc6A
I always wonder how in tasty videos the surface is so clean and it seems to be so simple
omfg i love her
Have they ever tried cream puffs?
They're pain a chocalat
she is my favorite 😂
what's her name ? that woman is beautiful, i´d eat anything you cook alex!!
this is the funniest, and Alix is like a ray of sunshine, I love her
needs more chocolate
Food and boobs perfect combination 🙂👌🏼
I wanna merry her
hard part for me making croissant are make sure fat not break the dough and make sure there still have layers when u cut
I love you so Much
I would love to work for tasty
pan au chocolat********
I’m craving chocolate croissants now
Curious why they have someone who has literally no idea how to make full puff pastry, make full puff pastry. 😳 Don’t get it Tasty. I applaud her efforts but people are trying to learn from these vids and I don’t think Tasty is teaching correct methods.
she’s amazing
Pain au chocolat*
OMG ITS A PAIN AU CHOCOLAT NOT À CHICOLATE CROISSANTS
too overly dramatic.
"Support your local baker" DEAD 😂😂😂😂
She's T H I C c af
the name for "chocolate croissant " is pain au chocolat or chocolatine in some region of france
Lmao, I love Alix's personality and shes actually very pretty! <3 Good job Alix!
who’s the dude at 4:44
it is NOT call chocolat croissant ,it is CHOCOLATINE ! !!! OK ????
Pain au chocolat
What the actual fuck those arent chocolate croissants theyre called pain au chocolat... ‘chocolate breast’ tf is wrong witg this video they could of researched apart from that they look rly good
I made croissants in class a ciuple semesters ago and lordy what a process. It also helped that we had a sheeter (litterally the butter tried to escape outta my dough a couple times)
Alix is so flippin' cute and adorable! Just the way she was so happy when she made them finally!
Do they have like 50 people cooking things at once
Pain au chocolat pas croissant au chocolat bordel de merde
Alix is going to make a chocolate quacksons
STOP! YOU ALMOST MADE ME DROP MY CROISSANT
Welp
So many "Croissant Expert" here... So proud of you guys 😊😊       Jk you're all sucks. Party pooper
She kept smiling. She looked so beautiful!!!
She’s fine as hell 😍 lmao
Idk why but i loooove this video! It just makes me laugh and love her failures and eventual triumph. I’d love more vids like this! Also the cold butter over a cheese grater trick actually works for biscuits!
"I gonna have a mental break down "* still smiles * me : the story of my life
She is a BBW for real tho!
Allez vous faire mettre avec vos nom chelou la on dit pas "Pate à macher" on dit "chewing gum" , alors c'est un "pain au chocolat" et pas "chocolate croissant"  Cordialement  La France
I love the way she smile and laughs..... she look so genuine and happy
She kinda pretty
Okay, it's neither a croissant or a 'Pain au chocolat' (Chocolate bread) It's a dammmm chocolatine :( Like Does that look  like a banana bread to you? not the same fierhf0piewh shape at all. thx bye
Y en a marre, C'est PAIN AU CHOCOLAT 😂😂 pq ils persistent à dire "chocolate croissant" 😂😂
Is it weird that I have a crush on her?
CHOCOLATE CROISSANT? MORE LIKE PAN EU CHOCOLAT
It's called a pain au chocolat = bread with chocolat
This is my 7 th time trying to make crossiant . M sooooo nervous . It’s like hard test on exam . My butter always pops out😭😭 let’s see what I’ll get this time

I love these behind the scenes videos. It makes me feel like less of an idiot when I mess up things that seem so easy. The croissants looked amazing in the end! 😋 Thanks for sharing!!
Are you kidding me? Don't these people look at recipes before they try to bake something? How on earth did she not know about the butter?!?!?

She looks  like Khaleesi, denerys, I forgot real name lol
You could chill your marble top before you use it. That would help keep the dough cool as you worked it. Love your persistence and personality.
And so many old people on FB hate on every single one of their Tasty videos.... They need to see this video to see all the hard work put into them...
Go to France
Love her attitude and persistence! She is adorable!
Literally too cute to not watch till the end :’)
Omg she’s so pretty!
Love her personality
My bae is at 4.43 - 4.53
this is the most fun video i've ever seen about one of the loveliest beautiful women in the world, trying her best, with shiny communicative smile, to do one of my favorite breakfast delights.
Uncultured swines that's s pine  o chocolat
why do i feel she looked a bit like Sansa Stark
GOD  I wanna MARRY HER 😍😍😍
Am I the only one that calls them pan au chocolates not chocolate crossaints
She's so sweet
JAJAJAJAJA
When I first saw tasty video i said "how did they make it so easy" and now i know how hard it is
need to fold it with butter!
4:40 Lol did the Buzzfeed guy go to tasty?
Puff pastry the most of easiest pastrys hahahah
They're called "Pain au Chocolat".
Who does the “OH YES”
You can buy these at the super Market for 3 bucks and they taste better
7:19
you so beautiful!!!
It’s that time where you see your baked goods look so good that you say “did I make that”?
I got some tears with this... I just watched for about 5 minutes, but I think I love her now
ok, so this was HILARIOUS. =D well done Alix.
she would be a great person to watch scary movies and drink wine with
2:35 Rie in the background xD
SHES TOO CUTE I LOVE HER
i love her so much omd
I don’t know why but she reminds me of Emilia Clarke
I think I like the behind the scenes better than the actual videos
She reminds me of Iskra Lawrence 😍😍😍
Lol I like this video. i like this girl. I was actually happy for her at the last part 😂😂
4:30 Omg it's Rie that was on Worth It Japan :D
They look amazing.
Napolitanas de toda la vida
this is how the tasty kitchens look  I thought it would be completely different idk😂 but it's nice
Is that what Americans call them? In french its just called bread with chocolat lol
4:26 SHADE SHADE SHADE
She’s so bomb😍😍
7:20 drops them 😂I would laugh but also feel so bad for her
Her ig is majortraeger
My spirit animal! I need to meet her
Im a Croissant and i approve!  *but i didnt appreciate that you stole my family and filled them with chocolate*  1 like can save a croissant from being eaten.
Omg 💖 this was satisfying !!
She is thicc
I think you mean she spoke too spoon
It’s not pronounced krassont it’s pronounced kwason
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
she is super thicc, tasty
omg I love her so much
She cute😊❤
Duuuuude, that's pain au chocolat, not chocolate croissant! 🙄
So all they do is cook food?
OMG Her smile is so adorable
wow ..i appreciate your hard work to get the perfectness , more than a day to get less than 2 minutes video ..woww !!  sorry for the bad english tho .
7:25  Alix:  *bursts into the room with a smile on her face*  Alix: *is wearing shades*  Alix: *flips hair*  Alix: *and suddenly all the croissants fall from her tray and onto the floor*
those are pain au chocolate
T H I C C
Rule as a pastry chef can't cut corners lol. Has to be square piece of butter and alot of folding. Once perfect the dough make lot different filling go in them. Same make apple or cherry turnovers
They’re called PAIN AU CHOCOLAT
Is a napolitana in Spain tho
What I’ve learned is to support your local baker 😹🤣
this took so much effort... respect ✌😢
I think I’m in love with Alex 😍
They are not called chocolate croissants!!!! They're pain au chocolat
When I watched the actual "how to make" video I thought "she really knows how to roll out dough really well". I never thought of pressing lines into the dough before rolling. But now I see how she perfected that technique. 8 days in a row, rolling dough all day, and you will probably learn how to do it more easily lol. Now I know how to make a square! ...instead of a blob like I usually do XP
U mean pain au chocolats, right?
Here is a better idea: Step 1: buy croissant dough Step 2: also buy Nutella  Step 3: take one of the  triangles of croissant dough and put Nutella in the center Step 4: roll up the croissants( roll from the wider end not the smaller side because it is not gonna shape like a croissant) Step 5: put on a baking sheet Step 6: whisk eggs and water to make a egg wash glaze on top Step 7: make as many as you want Step 8: bake in the oven for whatever your dough box says Step 9: wait till golden brown Step 10: Enjoy! 😃😃😃😃
Why don’t they were hairnets very unsanitar❗️❗️
Love her shade's at the end!!!!!
Who does the hoho yes
Tasty, the only good part of buzzfeed
She is fine
Hmm this is pain au chocolat not croissant, and I'm not even French
Lost it when she came out with the shades on
Its fucked up making a croissant dough without the right machines ^^ & for all smartasses out there... the best Chocolate croissants are found in Switzerland(bc of schoggi&quality) ;) So fuck that ''pain au chocolat'' disscussion..  the french way of making this dough is completly different and its not as tasty.
I love the american pronunciation of croissant...
Ummm why don't you actually hire proffesional do it... To get it right the first time..
Love her!
#teampainauchocolat
Woah so apparently I've been taking my favorite bakery for granted...  the moment she came out with glasses tho! hahahaha
Aneeeeeww you are so adorable
When I saw this video it reminded me of when I went to Las Vegas and visited my cousins and aunts and uncle I think we bought Croissants with chocolate inside juts like those and they tasted so good I think they bought it at a CVS
i wanna see more of her!!!
She's beautiful
Those are not crossaint it's pain eu chocolat
7:17 hahaha ❤❤❤
Get a pastry cutter 😵
I love these behind the scenes! But can we have a link to the finished video in the description? ^_^
It Names « PAIN AU CHOCOLAT » not « CROISSANT AU CHOCOLAT » !!!😡 OMG American people ruins everything I sware to god ! 😒
I can't stop smiling :)
♥♥♥Alix looks a little bit like Ronda Rousey.♥♥♥
STAAAAP YOURE GONNA MAKE ME DROP MY CROISSANT
quackson
anybody else see the flour handprints on her ass at 3:32?
Layers. Ogres have layers.
as someone who is french she did a fantastic job for like only 2 days of practicing. My dad is a pastry chef and it took me 6 years to get the same results as her LMAO
5:34 ME EVERYDAY
She's so cute 😂💕
* pain au chocolat
omg...she's so cute, can we please have more of her? 💖💕🙏
It's pain au chocolate you monster
It's called une chocolatine cmon people
Chocolate croissants don't exist. They are "Pain au Chocolat". It is a French word, and it is still used as the name everywhere else. The pain au chocolat and the plain croissant differ by more than chocolate. Please get your facts straight.
are you gonna finish that croissant
THOSE ARE NOT CROISSANTS 😦
CAN SHE PLEASE BE MY FRIEND OMGGGG CUTIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
This woman is perfect and her infectiously cheerful disposition means I would watch her make anything.
I LOVE HEr she's so gorgeous and positive
Where is the curve? It is not a croissant. It is a failure.
She's so pretty and her personality is so cute. Shes got amazing curves too... Might have a crush...
Just seeing Rie in the background looking professional as always
Somethiing is baking my trousers , something wrong
QUACKSONS.
this is pain au chocolat you uncultured swine.
Oh my god they look amazing!!  *Hahahhahah.... its butter..*
Wouldn't that suck if they burned hahaah
I think I'm in love with her aww
*These aren't Chocolate Croissants.. We call them "Pain au chocolat" in french, literally Chocolate Bread in english.*
I got a taste ad before this 😂
@ all the people freaking out over the name: Yes, it is a pain au chocolat (or a chocolatine, if you're from certain parts of France). But Tasty didn't go out of their way to call it a Chocolate Croissant — it's just what it's commonly called in the US. If you're in the states, most bakeries just label them as such, with the exception of French patisseries or franchises like Maison Kayser. Chill, y'all.
Like she could have saved 3 days if she'd looked online once to see that she was making the dough wrong instead of just wasting food and time over and over.
BODY GOALSSSS! she is gorgeous
I wanna work there now.
one more time i see someone commenting it’s called pain au chocolate or whatever the fuck it’s called i SWEAR to god,,
I like her sense of humor
*T H I C C*
Just go watch Binging with Babish, to learn how to make a croissant he does it 💯 times better
Isn’t this du “pain su chaucolat” ?
Was I the only one who thinks "where does all the failed attempts go to"... Low key hope this wasn't a waste of food.
CWOSANT
She is so pretty and so sweet
The American pronunciation of croissants makes me want to die every time I hear it oh my god  Side note It’s not even a croissant it’s a fucking pain du chocolat
Sorry but calling a pain au chocolat a « chocolate croissant » is like calling a snickers a « peanut mars »  But good recipe though ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
This video has completely changed my view on how easy task chefs make food
Tits.
More of her please!!!
THICC
Will done ✅ that's so yammy
She is most likely THE MOST BEAUTIFUL angel I've seen in my life. :|
You had to cut the croissants in long triangles to get that original croissant look....
she so ffff pretty and gullible i luv her
She is too cute ❤️
Why wasn’t she wearing pants tho
*T H I C C*
Hahahaha love it! But I'll never doing croissants. I want to see her in more vids! She made me laugh and smile a lot!
RIEEEEEEEEEEE
You like matilda ramsay
technically those are Pain au chocolat not Chocolate Croissants there is a distinct shape for a Croissant
This is so cool!! Always wondered the behind the scenes on these :)
Thicc
She is so beautiful. And her positive energy and happiness only adds to that beauty 😍😍
Rie in the background is like: The struggle is real
7:20 why the shades?
This is better than the actual video, please make more behind the scenes
Those are not called croissants, but pain au chocolat.
chocolate danish
Most adorable moment ever: 6:58
I guess I misunderstood Tasty.

I Love when they show the Real struggle and positive way to deal with it😆
You can't NOT hit the like button after that sunglasses scene dang.
This person makes me happy! =D
Love this! She's adorable!

It's pronounced kwason not crassont
thicc
She is so hot
I want this job...
you can be a producer and a chef at the same time
En France on se bat pour savoir si c'est pain au chocolat ou chocolatine et eux ils arrivent "chocolate croissant"
putain ca ressemble vachement a un croissant.  fucking Americans
i think she's beautiful,cute and funny...
You sooo cute😘😘😘
Let's just respect them for uploading videos like these and not complaining why they reupload these recipes all over again.Because it's hard to think of new recipes guys
C'est pain au chocolat bordel
It is actually called a Pain au chocolat
PAIN AU CHOCOLAT BRUH.
Is she Nikkie Tutorial’s sister? Cuz wow... they are twins! 😂
Omg I love her 😍😍😍❤️
Yay! I knew they make  mistakes the videos make it seem so easy
Pain Au's are amazing! I buy them from the supermarket all the time!
She cute tho!
Gaud damn this girl thiccccc
These are not croissants you friggin' uncultured swine. Call them Chocolatine, call them Pain Au Chocolat but not a croissant.
The name Ina at 7:45? That means mom is my native American language....who names their kid mom?
Public Research: Why Alex from Tasty Food Production is so charismatic?
The first thing they say sounds like they are saying I'm a TASTY producer
https://youtu.be/TZxocOu1Vh0
I love her true, never-giving-up personality!! We need to see her more ❤️
Great video, she’s a natural and should do these more often! However, that’s a pain au chocolat, not a croissant. #murica
You mean pain au chocolat, or chocolatine if you don't have a soul. But chocolate croissant sounds very wrong.
You're so beautiful. Will you marry me? 😍
Pain au chocolat vs Chocolatine vs Chocolate Croissant  In my head it’s French vs French vs America
She’s dumb thicc
Of course my favorite pastry of all time is the hardest to make. Go figure.
Who else saw Rea washing dishes in the back round
I will cook almost anything. But not croissants. Screw that shit.
It would have been funny if she dipped them when she did the hair flip.
Only haters use the dislike button
She’s honesty adorable
Adorable!
Tf do the bts get more views than the actual vid
how do you become a tasty producer and you are this bad at cooking?
This is not a chocolate croissant lol this is what we call un pain au chocolat
Thanks for sharing!  I like her attitude! =)
I love behind tasty
Lol I made croissants for the 1st time this year for thanksgiving ... I’m 16 ... ps: I got it all right the 1st time ... tips cut into triangles and roll from the big end up then fold in the edges .. they’ll look more like croissants. Otherwise very proud good job.
That is not a croissant, Its a pain Au chocolat
FIRST OF ALL THOSE ARE PAINS AU CHOCOLAT NOT CHOCOLATE CROISSANTS
I wonder when someone finally told her she needs to put butter in between the layers....
She is so cute
She is so nice!
does anybody know alix's instagram?
She’s fucking adorable not as adorable as my girlfriend though
All the dislikes are triggerd french people  lmao
She reminds me of Lizzie McGuire, anyone else?
She's so bubbly 😊
she is pissing me off. with every word
I felt bad eating a croissant watching this video........
that is not how u make a Croissant dough ...... failed
She’s so cuuuute
God damn she's thiccc with 3 c's
They're proper name is a 'pain au chocolat'
I love the positive vibes I got while watching her smile throughout the video! 😁
Wtf she think she’s doing. That’s a pain au chocolate not a croissant. Lol
Girly! Next time before taking it out of the plastic, use your rolling pin and hit the dough (not too hard). It will loosen it up for rolling. Shes so sweet! I like this girl :)
wow so cute
They're not called "chocolate croissants" they're called "pain aux chocolat"
Screw you I’m hungry now and it’s 3 AM ._.
One of the best blogs everrrr!! So funny and awesome.
A crossaint is a roll of chocolate lies
You are so beautiful!
Living proof to be appreciative of every tasty video and the work that goes into each one lol.
If i see someone say "aCtuaLLy, iTs pAiN Au CHoCoLat" one more time im gonna lose my mind
It’s actually a pan o chocolate
SHE IS SO BUBBLY AND FUNNY, need more of her😚😚😚
Finally likable people not like the others that swear all the time :D
chocolate croissants are good af
Pain au chocolat...
Who is the guy that says “ohh yess”
she is amazing and super cute, i love her! and i look up her being so patient but pleeeeease if you are working on the dough this much...dont put a chocolate bar inside...make your own cream, it would be waaaay better and professional! love
Correcting American stupidity happens too often. That is not a chocolate croissant okay? That is Pain au chocolate. When making European food you could at least know the fucking name.
6:56 tho
I didn't even know thus channel existed. I have watched so many Tasty videos its so weird to me
A for success, A for effort, A for persistence, A for everything.
never heard anyone say chocolate croissant 😂 its a bloody pain au chocolat, even if your not french
She’s seriously too cute instantly made me happy
Aren't these called pan au chocolat?
hey would you be so kind not to make me hungry >.>
4:44 okay please marry me...
She is soooo gorgeous
She has such a cute smile 😊 I love this video 😂
again it's a pain ou chocolat not chocolate croissant
im soo proud oh her hahahahaha.
She reminds me of the Hayden Panetterie (?). So bubbly and cute. Plus those croissants look delish.
She's gorgeous.
I'm French and it's not the true recipe ! God noooooooo
she's so prettyyy 😍😍😍
Her shirt: " So much internet to do "          *meanwhile... she's making choco crossants*
_are you going to finish that _*_c r o i s s a n t_*_ ?_
This channel is a great simulator of what hell is like
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 You could have dropped yo croissant
would it be ok to add an egg to the dough so you can split the mixed batch and make other bread pastries? The ingredients is not much different, except for the egg and measurements for different servings.
Omg so funny. This producer is adorable.
*sTop I cOuLd’vE dROpPeD mY cROIsSanT*
I LOVE her. That final walk of pride was hilarious. And I really admire how she kept her positivity despite failing so many times. You, lady, are amazing. Keep it up!
I was actually considering making it after seeing the video but then I came across this BTS.....welp I think I'm gonna just buy it 😅😂. *p/s: I love how smiley & cheerful Alix is! Love her!
Olive garden breadstick
She definitely reminds me of Clarke Griffin.
NET NEUTRALITY
I love all the tasty videos because they are so life giving and excellently presented!!! I really loved this video because even us very experienced cooks have days when we want to scream at the top of lungs for messing up a receipe!!! I am totally allergic to alcohol but I must say that I wished that I would have had one brewski inside of me because I would laughed even harder!😂😂😂Keep up the postive videos Tasty Team....Your Joyful efforts...help to remind me that YES...there still Intelligence on this planet!😄😊☺
Chocolate croissant... Fucking pain au chocolat, get it right
lmao, when she walked out of the door with her shades holding the pan!! Right on girl. HAHA
I love how Rie just smiled 4:35
I’ll dead bust her cheeks
Make me laugh. U are awsome
As a baker I can tell you that this is really really REALLY painfull to watch 😣
do you fucking mean pain au chocolat
step one to making chocolate croissants: learn how to say croissant step two; after learning how to say the word croissant, learn the difference between a croissant, and a pain au chocolat (the thing you actually made)
Go Alex!
I like y. 🙈
Though the butter and the dough maybe cold but baby youre so hot.
She is beautiful :ooo
She is so beautiful and such a lovely soul. Why cant i meet women like her on tinder.
What's the point of trying to do the intro again if you're just gonna add all the fails in
"...support your local baker"
She is so cheerful. Reminds me of emilia clarke
You’re sooooo pretty
So are these like Pain au chocolat?
Alex will you be my girlfriend?!? No? ..... 😥ok well lets be friends! Yo no lie your hair braided you remind me of ol girl on street fighter *brain fart*
she looks just like nickie tutorials!
Kinda disappointed that they aren't the size in the video but damn they look goooood
this bitch is thicc af! I want to marry her
When companies don't even research into what they are doing. It so rude and disrespectful. Chocolate croissants are a completely different thing. I really hope the correct their mistake as this is meant to be an educational video. And no I am not French but jeez I would not like to know how annoyed I would get if I was in there position as food is a big part of the culture and they couldnt even get the name right.....
Worth it watching her kick open the door with sunglasses on
i absolutely love you
I'm gonna respect every croissant I eat!
whats her ig?
They are pan au chocolat
Crwosshaunt...
Shes so fine 😍
THEYRE CALLED PAN AU CHOCOLATS GET IT RIGHT MATE
These are not croissants, they're called 'petits pains au chocolat'
You mean pain au chocolat😂
Who would know more about cinnamon rolls than Scott?
omg i just watched the actual tasty video yesterday, and as she was making this im like someone already did this go watch how they did it, then i recognized the hourglass tattoo on her hand ! and the it's the same person !! i appreciate you not giving up because that looks incredible !! never realized the amount of effort and time that goes into these tasties,  Thanks again !!
I LOVE RIE SO MUCH!
Love it. The flakey unicorn of pastries is hard to conquer. Bless you for your diligence. Lucky people that shared in that adventure of deliciousness.
Why does she keep looking up?
7:21 literally me when I accomplish something (finishing homework) and I’m like I’m back bitch *hair flip*
you are soo sweet and i lovet  thank you for evry thening you do from KSA
umm chocolate croissant??? nooooo
She's so cute 🙈🌈✨✨
I'm sorry but just have to say it, she's 100% wife material and whoever get's to hold her hand and tuck her in before going to sleep, is the luckiest man alive
She's so pretty 😍😍😍
Cute
Pain au chocolat
We need more Alix vids
She is so cute !
She forgot to fold in sheets of butter with the dough...put sheets of butter in between to parchment pieces, chill the butter and the dough, then place the butter on the dough and fold the dough over it..- I learned this in baking school and it was very difficult for me. I had to learn it and do it all in under 5 hours.
Thank You soooooo very much for playng this! I thought I was the only one who went thought that hell I did the exact thing and had to stop! Never Again! Your so comical! They look Tasty! Ha
When she came out in the sunglasses loll
She's so pretty, kinda reminds me on Iskra Lawrence
Ffffluff you disclaimer
I make those things regularly
Yeah better support me lol
thumbs up for the Rie Shade
U r really do more better than this
6:54 that smile it's all
That's a pain au chocolate not a croissant
she's so pretty and like... charismatic... I like her so much
I like her “ personality “
I absolutely love making croissants at home. One of my favorite classes I took in culinary school
And this is why pillsbury doughboy is my BFF  :)
They aren't even croissants
She’s so adorable
This is hilarious
Chubby Kaley Cuoco ...penny from Big bang theory
It’s a pain au chocolat?
this is a pain au chocolat...
I feel that she's so sweet. I will love if i have a chance to hug her...
Omg its called pain aux chocolats. Not chocolate croissant
You are soooo beautiful
Oh my goodness! I would get lost in that ass!! She is thiiiiic AF! That ass is a big deal.
This isn't a chocolate croissant.
You make food for a living, ... Where can I sign up?!?
i would smash
isn't it pronounced as "kwasougnm"?
isn't this more a pain au chocolat
Sweet and gorgeous. And I'm not just talking about the croissants ;)
If it’s hard add water if it’s wet add flour like shit use some common sense
Actually thats a pain au chocolat
Goddamn. Work bitch. Slay my life. YAS.
she is so adorable!! love her she is so cute and bubbly
She’s so pretty woow
left video at 0:22 seconds
Next time I eat a chocolate croissant I’ll cherish it
The Tasty producer from Japan in the background!!
Well done but that seems more like a pain au chocolat
Yup. I'll definitely buy them. I've thought about making croissants. Ah... Nope. I do not have the patience for that.
they're "pain au chocolats" not "chocolate croissants", please don't butcher the french language, food is VERY important to us
c'est ce qu'on appelle le pain au chocolat pas de croissant au chocolat, les croissants au chocolat sont des croissants au chocolat dedans mais ce n'est pas un croissant avec du chocolat dedans c'est un pain au chocolat. English:that is called chocolate bread not chocolate croissant, chocolate croissants are croissants with chocolate in it but this isn't a croissant with chocolate in it its a chocolate bread.(if the English isn't good sorry)
Those are pan au chocolates cmon now, chocolate crossaints arent shaped that way they are different
Those are pana chocolates
"If you make your own croissants, you can eat them too becausw you have worked out" is exactly what i always think to justify me eating everything i made in 1 sitting
A chocolate croissant is actually called a pain au chocolat. Like that’s their actual name.
Support your local bakerrrr
Support your local bakerrrr
M8 it's a pain au chocolat not a chocolate croissant
Bts....
she's so cute wow
Props for the attempts, I would have given up after the 2nd or the 3rd time :D Thank you for this video, because it actually shows what it takes to make the perfect version, as it always looks so easy and effortless in the end video. But behind camera you can see it takes a million tries till it gets right. As a beginner you really show me it's not just me and give me hope I'm not a bad cooker, just inexperienced  ^_^
I want more videos from this happy gal
Am I the only one who thinks she looks like nikkitutorials?
PAIN AU CHOCOLAT
she is so funny omg
Why are you a tasty producer if you aren't good at baking
Dear Americans, please stop calling this pastry a "chocolate croissant" because IT IS NOT!!! THAT IS CALLED A PAIN A CHOCOLAT!!!!!
Have I ever told you that you look like         A CROISSANT *SNAP SNAP SNAP SNAP SNAP SNAP SNAP SNAP*
* only 2 second into the video *  Me: I love her
4:19 *TRIGGERD*
ITS CALLED PAIN AU CHOCOLAT UGH A CROISSANT MEANS A CRESCENT SHAPED PASTRYYY THESE ARE NOT CRESCENT SHAPED AND PLEASE STOP PRONOUNCING CROISSANT "CWASSONTSS"  YOU JUST UGH IM PISSED THATS IT IM TRIGGEREDDDD
"If I've learned anything in those nine days it's that... support your local baker." XD
I LOVE THIS GIRL, HONESTLY, JUST SO GENEROUS AND FUNNY.
That intro was cringey, how stupid are you?
We need more of alex's behind the scenes video..  She's just too adorable..
French people are saying it's pain au chocolat because it is. Chocolate croissant is simply chocolate in the normal croisant. Pain au chocolat is chocolate rolled in the dough to form the log shaped- croissants aren't usually rolls, so it's not a chocolate croissant.
7:33 she actually looks like corrine
She got a whole lot of dandruff on those croissants.
it's pain au chocolat, not Chocolate Croissants
She’s so cute I love her
I really loved this video. Alix is amazing.
*heart eyes emoji* For Alex.
hahah the unrollable dough anyone else found that funny
Damn Alix thicc with 2 c's
I don't understand if the dough was too wet why not just add more flour ? Totally a waste of dough to make extra lol
Rie (?) in the background thats actually cooking
this is making me want to go to my local bakery and get a chocolate croissant. If this video proved anything, its to not attempt croissants
I love her ....she the cutest i ever seen...
Cough cough CHOCOLATE cough DANISH
Good to see adelle cooking
I’m in culinary school majoring in baking and pastry and have never struggled this hard on pain au chocolat (chocolate croissants) and  would definitely make them again hahaha
Not enough butter....
My born and raised in France heart is boiling, it's called a fucking P A I N  A U  C H O C O L A T
She's hot not gonna lie.
Nutcracker music in the background got me thinking about how I'll be playing the whole thing next Saturday.
She should get her own channel and be free to tell whats on her mind + she looks like corine from thread Banger you know ( corine vs pin )
...underwear at 7:19
They're called chocolatines
their proper name is pain au chocolat
There called pan un chocolate
This just proves to show that Tasty is so deceptive. They make their smal, quick clips look like it's so easy to make when in reality it isn't. That's why everytime I try to copy one of their recipes, it doesn't turn out so good 😂
aahhh stop !! I could've dropped my croissant !
the end result made me so happy! i had no idea so much work goes into these "how to" videos
So you are a producer for a channel that is all about food and you don't even know that dough cracks like that because it is dry.
She's so cute. More videos of this gal.
7:18 - 7:35 is literally me after cooking instant ramen
Dear U.S,  Kwa-ssonn.  Kwa. ssonn.  ˈkrwasɒ̃  Yours sincerely, The civilised world.

Chocolate Croissants ? wtf is that ? never heard before - french
C'est PAIN AU CHOCOLAT putain de merde. If it was French people mistaking English you would be irritated too.
😍😍😍
"Making croissants?  I made them one time, NEVER AGAIN!"  This is so me😂😂😂😂😂
She seems like such a positive person she's so lovely!!  Great job! ♥ :)
I never knew this much work went into tasty videos, they seem so simple and easy. It’s nice to get a peek behind the scenes.

I like to see the behind the scene to make ur product. Please share more behind the scene *pardon my english
This series is so goooooood
Aww she was so happy at the end 😭
That’s pain au chocolat not croissants smh
She’s cute af lol
she is so beautifull
The butter makes steam when it melts puffing up the pastry. Not C O2...
she brings me so much joy omg
where is her dress from???
ALEX IS SO CUTE
shes so pretty
Her almost-tripping is me at work on a daily basis.
Whatta queen
Why do you call it croissants ? That’s so weird, they’re called (petit) pain au chocolat... and they’re deliciiiious !  A (butter) croissant is this by the way 🥐 (most of the time there’s no chocolate)
She's so cute and positive! I like her.
Napolitanas de chocolate*
She's more committed than me, I would have said "f-it" and just bought puff-pastry dough at the first sign of trouble.
I like watching cute girls bake.
"I made those once in culinary school. Never again." Lololol
she's so effing cute
I absolutely loved this video!!! I laughed so hard and I was truly rooting for you Alex! So happy you got your dough to turn out but now I know I will not be attempting to make croissants myself lol
but thats not a croissant right? i mean we call em napolitanas
When she walked out with the sunglasses hahaha so victorious! I love this video
Well good for her!  Talk about labor intensive baked goods, croissants win a prize.  She's funny and adorable.  Good point, get a hearty workout, eat homemade bread goods.
DONT SAY CHOCOLATE CROISSANT PLEASE IT'S A PAIN AU CHOCOLAT
Lol, I loved this video! Too fun!! Glad you didn't give up, they look amazing!
Please can you apologies for calling it « chocolate croissant » and not Pain au chocolat. Thank you. Signed : France.   You Tasty/Buzzfeed make amazing videos and have great ideas but OH LORD YOU ARE SO GOOD AT KILLING CULTURES from other countries.
...Yes?
nice try, but 4 out of 10. some wrong steps. If intereting can help with something like this https://scontent-frt3-1.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/e35/20589461_821608208013883_7183911016827191296_n.jpg
It's called a chocolatine.
Shes too likeable to be true
She’s pretty.
LOVED THIS, SO SO FUNNY
She's so cute
She made it yaee
All that work for only 5 croissants... 😂🤦
BATISTE DRA SHAMPOW
She’s adorable !!! And thiccccc😍😍😍
Its actually a pain au chocolat as in bread of chocolate
They look like pain au chocolates not crossiant
It's pronounced cwasongs
croissant au chocolat mais wshhhh PAIN AU CHOCOLAT
who else heard in the background at 4-5 minutes the periotic table song
This video makes me fucking like her.
*chocolatine
Wassup guh can i getcho nuummbbaaa?
America,   IT IS PAN AU CHOCOLAT - THIS IS NOT A CROISSANT!!  sincerely, Europe
This is called pain chocolat 😍
In France people quite happily bake many sorts of breads and most pastries even macaron which are quite hard to get right, but I have never met anyone who has attempted the chocolate croissant (or even plain croissant)... you are so brave, you deserve an award from France
Come on buzzfeed! She's a great host but the constant peeking volume? Set your audio levels! Gahhh.
Is tasty and buzzfeed like work together?
Already a big fan, great job, gurl! So spontaneous <3
I was fully expecting her to fall when she had the baked croissants 😂
WTF is a chocolate croissant? It's called a PAIN AU CHOCOLAT
i dont get the concept of watching a person who cant bake for shit try to bake
I totally support the effort that goes into this, but it's a bit frustrating to see that effort put into the wrong actions. Instead of trying so many different steps, a quick research would have sufficed and prevented some of the failed batters. This puff pastry rises because it is a mille feuille dough, it traditionally does not include the leavener yeast, as yeast batter has its own tangy flavor often associated with cinnamon rolls and donuts. On top of that, the commentary about the difficulty of the dough is totally exaggerated! Mille feuille is *NOT* hard to make, it is merely time consuming. And even so, any one requiring 3 days to make it is pretentious, its takes a minimum of 5 hours mainly because of the waiting time.  But I don't doubt that these are delicious to have or that the video was entertaining.
I had a lot of fun watching this . She is so good and natural + cute...
If you're making this do it on a marble or glass cutting board and freeze the board before and in between making it... it'll help keep the dough cold
They are acctually called  pain au chocolat - french
i thought tasty recipes were supposed to be easy...
The are called pain au chocolat I am French by the way
I LOVE HER
"omg its look amazing" "its butter"
Pain au chocolat
Im not a professional chef or anything but im pretty sure thats a pana chocola (idk how to spell it)
she is sooooooo cute
Wasn't she from buzzfeed?
This is "pain au chocolat"! One of the best things of our country
nice one...interesting..
All I see is people complaining about the French,but no French comments :D
i'm so impressed! and extra impressed that you kept at it! the final product looked amazing!!
That wasted so much food 🥘
SHES SO CUTE OMG SHE REMINDS ME OF ADELE
C’est une chocolatine !
You're so pretty!
That girl got a phat ass👍👍👍
i love these behind tasty videos so much! so nice to see all the hardwork these chefs/producers put into one video. please do make more!
Very painful to watch. Hahaha. But at least she got close.
It took her 8 days and it was her job ..... can't wait for the month i am about to spend in my kitchen 😂😂😂😂
*pain au chocolat it's NOT a croissant :/
She’s so beautiful and hot !! I love her energy and positivity ❤️❤️❤️
She's the Ronda Rousey of Croissants
I never thought they were hard
It needs to be in a crescent shape if you wanna call it a croissant.
Shes reminds me of trisha paytas, but not insane.
THOSE LOOK SO BOMB
Very huge difficult effort thanks for u how did u still patient?☺️☺️
QUACKSON
BUT THAT'S PAIN AU CHOCOLAT
She’s very attractive lol
Tasty hire meee
I'll continue to go to Starbucks for my chocolate croissants :-) Lol!!
the new yt looks horrible
the new youtube looks terrible
Hi guys, i'm tasty
Song at 2:27?
I am her fan now. She is so funny
I always end up wearing dark clothes when I bake. It's inevitable.
Boi stop stuffing chocolate into me jeez
I like how she's so optimistic and positive. She's so cute and adorable
you go girl! never give up!!! girl power! ;)
Did anyone notice that in the beginning she said IT LOOKS LIKE AN HOURGLASS, and at the end she exposed her hourglass tattoo
I want to work with tasty 😥 My dream job ❤
bravo
THOSE ARE PAIN AU CHOCOLAT!!!
big a@!... heard!
french-style rolling pin is better suited to this type of dough...
Okay...among French people we already have the pain au chocolat /chocolatine feud....so don't add to the argument with your chocolate croissant! You know we are touchy, annoying on the subject!!!fyi: The term croissant doesn't refer to the dough but the shape!!! A chocolate croissant could exist if it was filled with chocolate and shaped like...a croissant!!!!!! Or if we follow your logic hot dogs are sausage brioche...
Loved this! Especially since the 3 minute video makes it seem so easy :D
Reminds me of nikkietutorials
She like a cute version of Nikki tutorials lol
I'm in love
I make chocolate crosants since I was 14 (i’m in a balgian bakkery school) and in my languaus its called chocolade broodjes its actually the butter that is the problem it smelts to fast thats Why you need special margerin for croissants
Poor Starbucks has to go through this every day...
... it's a pain au chocolat
Click here for the funniest fail ever and then press read more: 7:19       DIDN'T I TELL YOU?!?!?!??!!?
I'm a big fan of tasty and I love watching the behind the scenes videos like this. It was beautiful.. the croissants too.
Honestly store bought puff pastry tastes just as good as homemade and you save a lot of time.
pain au chocolat svp
MAKE MACAROONS
PAIN AU CHOCOLAT NOT CHOCOLATE CROISSANT please !!! - angry French girl
PAIN AU CHOCOLAT DUH
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍 I am in love with her wtf
Please keep doing behind the scenes!!!
*Pain au chocolat
lol, I like this. Now ik the struggle I’d face if I made this
Hard work paid off :)) yayy
Why calling is a chocolate croissant when it's not it's real name! Sorry but as a french I am triggered lol. You call a croissant its original name in English but change it for pain au chocolat? I know not everyone knows about pain au chocolat but you should have put it in the title, people would have been so confused lol
those are not croissants. i don't know their english name, in spanish it is "napolitanas"
pain au chocolat ou chocolatine ?
Working for tasty looks like such a cool job
Pour les français, vous dites chocolatine ou pain au chocolat??
Just as overdramatic as buzzfeed videos. It's not her fault she, she seems sweet.
It be funny if these would actually crossisant instead of pain ah chocolat
ooooooh  i like the little captions in the real vid.  and yes, puff pastry is very hard. you constantly have to put it in the fridge
They look so good😋💕
That's a pain au chocolat not a croissant wut
I never really thought about how much time it takes not only to make chocolate croissants, but to also make all of the steps look good on camera too.
The butter doesn't create Co2! The yeast in the dough does, the butter just separates the layers and "fries" them
This is the quality content I like to see lolol
It looks very good! But it isn’t actualy croissants, it’s called « pain au chocolat » ( chocolate bread) :)
would love to see you more Alex on tasty !!!! so much fun watching you
She reminds me of NikkiTutorials!!
Croissants are called like so because of their shape. It means "crescent" in French. These are not the half moon shape that give croissants their name. They're called "pain au chocolat" (bread with chocolate). But the video was awesome and the girl is hilarious and cheerful! Huge fan of her!!!
I want this job
clearly a PAIN AU CHOCOLAT
Isn’t it called a pain au chocolat
It’s not called a chocolate croissant 🤨🤦🏼‍♀️
The making has more views than the original video 😅
okay first of all, at least wear an apron if you at least know you're going to be messy,
I wish I had her bodyyy
She's so funny and beautiful!!!! I'm in love!
this is a "pain au chocolat" not a croissant
Bitch it’s a pain au chocolat
Chocolate croissants are 1 of my favorite breakfast peaces.
Annoying video to watch
My favorite from Panera 😍
Nice pain au chocolat
magnifique!!
She s such a cutie!
They're Pan aux chocolate not chocolate croissants
Where i’m from, they call chocolate croissant, “chocolatine”
I love how positive and funny she is not to mention pretty
*Pain au Chocolat
"Pain au chocolat"? More like "pain" au chocolat
Those are Pain au Chocolat.... I think.
It' s called a pain au chocolat
Love this!!!! But this will take me a month to get correct lol!! You did a good job
lmao i love her
How is that a croissant
She is so stinking cute I cannot handle it
That’s not a chocolate crossant. Crossant in French means crescent 🌙. That is like a chocolate bread roll.
👏👏👏👏👏
7:20 The same face I make when I know I will definitely pass the exam
c pas croissant chocolate c pain au chocolat  (bread of chocolat)
They look burn from the bottom.
So kids, today we learned that it's better to do things right the first time rather than half-assing a bunch of times
Well so even tasty producers can't get everything right in first try... I like it because this is something real. The mesmerizing tasty videos where everything went so smoothly were probably made like this too. So don't feel bad if you keep messing up.
Looks awesome (in the uk and france, not sure about elsewhere,  we call them pain au chocola) sorry probably spelt everything wrong
she's adorable
More behind the scenes plz😂😍
Milk and croissants :p
That makes sense.. uploading a recipe video and admitting that it's basically impossible to do if you don't want to spend days on it 😅
I like this lady she needs to do more videos🤗
She is SO pretty 😍
Name of the song in 2:53?
This would be so easy for me just because I live in a super cold climate this time of year. I mean it went from 76 degrees feirinhight (my spelling tho) to 36 degrees in days.
https://imgur.com/PQBAKz3
ME #shanedawnson
she's adorable & gorgeous
Don't make any of these tasty recipes. Apparently the producers havent even make them before.
ok Alix is my  favorite tbh.
she's adorable
Why chocolate croissant they’re chocolatines 😋😋😋😋
Very cute
She's so cute! I wish she was my best friend 💝
she's such a dork
She's cute :) What kind of American accent has she got? Is that a Southern accent?
Omg she forgot the butter hahaha
Awww I like heeeerrr
Make a playlist of the behind tasty videos please :)
so much work and effort went into the video and everyone is just complaining that it's supposed to be called pain au chocolate
Yo she cute af
10/10 would relationship the shit out of her
maybe knead the dough more before folding the butter?
She is my new fav buzzfeed staff
hahaha that's so funny! love this channel😍
I love that tasty did this because so many people complain about their food and little do they know how hard they work! To bring content m! Good job girl they looked amazing!
2:17 so T H I C C and yummy :)
She’s got the YEEKS
I dont care but she is damn cute!
Congragulations.  You just made puff pastry from scratch. Tradisonly its folded up to 100 folds and rolled out with a mecanical roller.  Or you could use a pasta roller :) Puff pastry from scratch is hard to do so good job:)
ITS PAN AU CHOCOLATE  NOT CHOCOLATE CROISSANT  MY FRENCH TEACHER ALMOST HIT ME FOR CALLING IT THAT  crossaint - Crescent Pan au Chocolate - chocolate bread
I love the way she do. So sweet
Hi
She's so cute😘😍
You go girl! Give yourself a pat in the back *i wish I did*
Are you gonna finish that croissant?
Omg I lover Herr!!! ❤️😻
Omg I lover Herr!!! ❤️😻
DID NO ONE LOOK UP A CROISSANT RECIPE AHEAD OF TIME??? HAVE NONE OF YOU HEARD OF "DOUGH LAMINATION"??? The baker in me has developed an eye twitch...
I just finished making theses today, and let me say, it's even harder than it seems like in this video. my arms and hands hurt SO MUCH from rolling rock hard dough over and over
She is so pretty!! Put your muscles in it girl!!! 😜
Why does she keep lookin' up? Kinda bothers me. But yummy!!! Hahaha
Chocolatins 😍
chocolate will burn in oven while baking hhhhhh it ll b awful LOOOL if u wanna make i test hhhhh just but in microwave 200 g or 300 dark chocolate for more than 2 or 3 min ..... hhhhhh u can t eat it anymore   guess wa will happen a chocolate in 200 c oven LOOOOOL
I enjoy watching this behind the scenes so much!! You did a really great job Alix : )
I made croissants in 3 hours
She's absolutely hilarious!! Good on for her for keeping such a positive attitude throughout this whole episode 😂❤️
yall need to watch the great british baking show
This videos thumbnail shows a womn bent over a table probly getting butt raped! This image is both vilent and obscene and the video needs to be taken down! Everyone mass fleg this video!
8 days?! Wow Buzzfeed does have too much resources at its disposal. What a way to kill time and make an earning out of it!
She’s so cute lol
I think I'm in love with you Alix.
I love her...
I wanna know who the hottie is in the background at 3:34!
Just go to McDonald and buy two (2) chocolatines for 1.59$
Absolutely love the behind the scenes videos!
Amazing, it is really encouraging to see almost  the entire process of trial and error and finally success. Thank you, Tasty!
I was just admiring her cuteness and then I went to the comments to see a war between 'its called pain au chocolate' and 'calm down, we are not French' group. Come on, its a chocolate food item, can we just quietly enjoy and let others enjoy it.
So god damned cute~! Go girl~
Her clumsiness makes me say 'me too' LOL and so much hard work and time goes behind each video. I feel like I am obligated to make these now, just to honour all your efforts
Dry yeast in cold dough?
There's this Sweet Girl & then there's Ashley  Honestly Tasty should Give her More Segments instead of that ungrateful annoying Ashley
Alix walking out of the room when she finally perfected the croissants is how I wanna walk into my classroom on the last day of school WITH MY SQUAD 😂
CINNAMON ROLL CROISSANT YESSS
So this was really cool to watch! I love watching  tasty videos and it's cool to see how they are actually made and the people behind them are the ones actually making and editing the video. Also, I noticed that there are a ton of other tables like this with the camera set up and I guess other producers film their own at the same time... so cool lol.
What a babe.
THE PUREST TASTY CHEF NEXT TO RIE
Sweet video!
You guys should do this with EVERY recipe...so mere mortals (like moi) will be able to totally relate and not feel inadequate.
Note to self-never try to make croissants from scratch!
She made a pie crust..
Does anyone know the name of the song at the beginning??? Please replyyy ahh Im dyin xD
I think I love her
so fun looking forward for another one of the challenging recipe
That's not a chocolate croissant... It's a pain au chocolat
Where can i find fucking croissant at 3 in the morning!!
It’s called pain au chocolat
What a qt lol
It's nice to see Alex getting so many compliments.   I figured everybody (well, at least the Brits) would be calling her a fat stupid American, or at least say "white people".
She's so pure oml
Her voice like demi levato
did you just call......................................... pains au chocolat................... chocolate croissants??????????????????????? CHOCOLATE CROISSANTS????????? BITCH WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU???? WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU??????!!!!!? THOSE ARE PAINS AU CHOCOLAT OH MY FUCKING GOD I WOULD'NT EVEN BE THAT MAD IF YOU HAD CALLED THEM CHOCOLATINES BUT JESUS MOTHERFUCKING CHRIST cHoCoLaTe CrOiSsAnTssSSSSssssSsssssSSsSsSsS???????????? WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA WHY CAN'T YOU DO ANYTHING THE PROPER WAY????? THIS IS PURE DISRESPECT TO MY CULTURE NIQUE L'AMERIQUE VIVE LA FRANCE PUTAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIN
Lovely girl, but who wants to watch someone apologize for 30 minutes while she teaches us absolutely nothing?
I'm french and what you call a "chocolate croissant" is actually called "pain au chocolat" (literally means chocolate bread bc a croissant is a croissant, "chocolate croissant" does not exists in France) :)
when you chant your own name
Why does everyone at Buzzfeed seem to focus on quirkiness instead of training and experience? I don't want to be so critical but Tasty chefs seem to be either amateurs or self trained. Is that intentional? What qualifications does one need in order to be a chef for such a major presence in the internet?
someone point her in the direction of Great British Bake Off! Needs butter layers
It's called pain au chocolat not chocolat croissants (I'm French)
More of these vids Tasty! 👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾
They are not croissants they are called chocolatine
She thicc
8:26 FINALLY
is any types of chocolate work?
Is any types of chocolate will work?
I LOVEEE BEHIND THE SCENESSSS!!!!
We have this un every bakerie un France for 0.5$
oof
Well done! Puff pastry is SO HARD make when you're not a trained, professional baker. Good job!
Lol she said "if i learned anything in these 9 days it would be to support your local bakers"😂😂💪 she is funny
I tried making croissants once... It goes without saying that they didn’t come out right and I‘m never trying again 😂😂
a buttery *_flaky_* crust
I did cinnamon croissants before and they are amazing. You guys should try it.
She's so cute though ^_^
The shot that is missing from this is when she realises that the home made version tastes EXACTLY the same as what you can make with store bought dough. That's why I'll never make croissants again; because they just aren't worth it!!
But aren't these supposed to be crescent-shaped?
Tasty is slowly turning into a CRINGE WORTHY channel like all the other Buzzfeed channels! PLEASE leave the staff out of the frame, DON'T abandon what made you great in the first place! Not everything has to be about the views, go back to making great and fast recipes around the minute mark! I've been a sub since 250k...looks like I'm unsubbing.
Pain au chocolat dear american friends. PAIN AU CHOCOLAT.
We call it pain au chocolat
A lot of people assume ‘oh this looks so easy’ but little do they know what the tasty crew have to go through
Same I made them one time. Never again
Dopest dope I've ever smoked! #lostdoe Great video!  Way to keep at it
This girl is so cute & bubbly! I wanna be her friend!! lol
She needs a haircut

Omg congratulations. Perseverance always pays off.
7:18 if summer comes
She looks like corrine when she comes out
Great job! Fun to watch. You're so pretty 😍
It really bothered me that she wore sleeveless tops to roll out the dough. Sorry, kinda gross.
The people working in Tasty are just so likeable, they're always so lively and enthusiastic!!
Alex is cute. Would be drop dead gorgeous if she lost a bit of weight.
One day process? Just buy the prepackaged pillsbury croissants and add chocolate chips to them.
More behind please 😆😆
THICC
When you try to make it just like the vid but come out like crap😭
Thumbs up if you keep pausing to check out their gear and lighting setup.

Was the purpose of this video to teach people what *not* to do when they want to make a laminated pastry?
hi! !
well, i guess she has a point to call it croissant, since the dough and the process is the same as for just french croissant. but indeed it's pain au chocolat, because it's not in the form of croissant. plus french make croissants that are called croissant au beurre (just butter croissant with nothing inside, but sometimes they put stuff as raisins secs or nuts, but my french bf is losing his shit when they add something inside, calling it not the real ones), and the croissants with something inside is more italian thing, but again it's not a croissant it's cornetto and made with different pastry.  btw, if your pain au chocolat's chocolate is hard, put it in microwave, the pastry will be back to soft and chocolate will be so delicious. just don't burn your tongue.   P.S. so much croissant as a word
👏👏👏👏👏
she is so cute
ITS CALLED A PAIN AU CHOCOLAT IM CRYING
😑😑🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣hhhh so cool
7:20 is like that moment when you pass a test for the 2nd time in your whole life
So if this tells us something guys, is never feel bad when your dish doesn't look like the tasty one 🙆🏼‍♂️
So if this is a chocolate croissant, what's an actual croissant filled with chocolate called in the US?? I mean, Brits would call a chocolate filled croissant a chocolate croissant and the thing in the vid a pain au choc
She's, beautiful
she really seemed so happy at the end and it just made my heart break
My first croissants came out as sweet pretzels lol. They were good though!
All these people who say that they're not called chocolate croissants don't realise "pain au chocolat" would sound pretty awkward in english. No one wants pain...
She is tasty
i wanna be a tasty producer too. <3
More Alix, please!
IT IS CALLED CHOCOLATINE
i have same food
Lol that's me when I bake
That victory hair flick was so damn cute
You remind me of my devasted experiences of making croissants 😂😂 I love your video and effort too of course and you are so cute Miss producer 😄😍😍 goob job 👏 hope to see you again with another adventurous experience 😍 xx
Who's the guy at 4:42 ?
that butter drenching from the tray omg xD
-hello- 👈 Do you know how to make this?
*what a legend.*
I THOUGHT SHE IS NIKKIE TUTORIALS omg
Was she using the wrong recipe in the beginning?
omg! I am in love with this girl!
Good job!!! You did a good job. Congratulations 🎉🎊
It's kind of silly to generalize all Americans as uncultured. (ex. if Americans call dumplings dumplings, Chinese people shouldn't feel super insulted by the fact it's not called/pronounced properly...) Yes, America does not really have a proper cuisine. We've only been around for 200 years, and the country is also based off of many different people. That does not mean that every single person is a stuck-up egoist. Also, the description box clearly says that these pastries are called pain au chocolate. Please observe and think before you speak. ;)
you're just adorable!  i didn't care anymore  about teh croissants LOL
Translate 'pain au chocolat" to English and tell me that it still describes what she made more than "chocolate croissants".You all are idiots. Nobody but a fucktard would give two fucks what they were calling them here in the vid.
What sort of bloody job is this where you can fail, fail and fail again and your boss just laughs?
Body goals! Love her
She’s hot😍🔥
This is why you don’t hear there voice in there usual videos
She looks a bit like Nikkie tutorials
Anyone else think she seemed/ acted like some stoner the whole vid? Lol still so sweet and determined tho! I love the “high side” of buzzed
Tbh Alex is one of the most beautiful woman I've seen
Honestly, this intro is gonna be harder than my dick
What I took away from this video - don't bother trying to make croissants yourself unless you are a masochist.
Sexy lady but funny
I love her already!!!
loved the scene when she walked out with the chocolate croissants
Lmao if she can’t make them how do they expect us to follow the recipe
Chocolate croissant?! That's a fucking pain au chocolat you bloody idiot
please post more of these
OMG! She is sooooo pretty. She is literally the prettiest girl I have seen who works in Buzzfeed. She can be a model. Be the next Ashley Graham! Girl work it! 😁😍
ㅌㅎㄹㄹ치ㅏㅏㅣㅌㅌㅎ
She is soo cute...tasty should continue these kinds f videos...and now everyone a big shout out to ALix...ALIX!😊
“I hear chocolate croissants are hard to make” WOAH I WENT TO A TOAR AT A SKEWL AND I SAW THEM JUST HAVE PRE MADE CROISSANT BREAD AND JUST BUT CHOCOLATE IN IT AND ROLL IT AND PUT IT IN THE OVEN AND WABAM!
She is an adorable person, way to persevere!
Now I know why it’s called Pain Au Chocolat
using pastry margarine is the key i guess
Buzzfeed’s best content
God dammit I wish I looked like her
I need these in my life. Also I feel I should just say, Alix u are one gorgeous woman😅😅😅
I'll stick with Laura Vitale https://www.youtube.com/user/LauraVitalesKitchen
Damn I freaking love tasty enough already! I'm so happy you guys do a BTS!! This makes my heart happy 😍😍
Damn she is beautiful!
omg they create co2 in the oven??? NO it creates STEAM from the water in the butter!!! ugh these people
She's so cute! Every time I think about giving up I'll remember this ❤️
How many fucking tasty producers does tasty have lmao they bring in a new one every video
Sooooo adorable she is....
How to Make Croissants Recipe - Laura Vitale - Laura in the Kitchen Episode 727 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgsN1gymxxY 🥂👍🏻
Too goofy, try again
There is your like good people
omg she is SO cute.
I want to work over there😭
She is someone who can do Pinterest perfect
Support your local baker guys!
I applaud her tenacity to keep working on getting these pain au chocolat right. That being said ... a little homework on how to go about making these would have saved her 8 days.  And like what others have mentioned, I guess the only prerequisite for working at Tasty is "I like to cook food".
I COULDVE DROPPED MY chocolate CROISSANT
This is why I only WATCH Tasty videos, I never attempt to make them.
I pick up on new techniques and recipes pretty fast, I think I'd do well at Tasty!
She’s really cute hope we see more of her :)
Why do they feel the need of putting bloopers in the actual video. Annoying af
Okay I have the biggest crush on her omg
Next time just go to Costco we have plenty of them. 😂😂
Am i the only one think that the intro is annoying 😅
@Tasty love Alex! ..for sure!!
Look at that stratigraphy
it’s called a « pain au chocolat » you uncultured swine hahaha
The people complaining about those who complain that it’s called “pain au chocolat” are more annoying in the end...
You are so cute. I can't make that
You're misinformed. You don't know what a croissant is. This is a pain au chocolate.
I love how there is an insane fight in France about the name of this pastry (pain au chocolat or chocolatine) and Americans come along with a new name to complicate even more the debate :')
Omg she's so cute
A croissant is called a croissant because it has a specific shape and recipe ... This is a pain au chocolat which is an another thing the only common point is that the dough which is used is the same for both of these pastries  And yes this is important
I'm really glad for all these behind the scenes video--Tasty's videos make it look so effortless but it's encouraging to know it's not supposed to be smooth sailing.
she is so pretty!!!
"Support your local baker" praise! We need it!
Are you gonna finish that        CROISSANT
Gr8 job! It looked like that was very difficult to do
She's so cute ☺️
Who's hungry for croissants now?
You guys are one of my favorite channels. I steal so many of your recipes. Ima big fan!!! And Alex is so purdy too.
Rie in the background 😂
You shouldn't use dairy not your mama not your milk
She thick
WHY DO AMERICANS INSIST ON CALLING THEM CROISSANTS *THEY ARE NOT CRESCENT SHAPED* THEY’RE PAIN AU CHOCOLAT
it's pain au chocolat, why are Americans so thick ?
STAP YOUR GONNA MAKE ME DROP MAI CRESSAUNT
Who the fuck calls a pain au chocolat a “chocolate croissant”? Nope.
Cinnamon roll croissants I want that
She's so funny
I'm far more interested in Alix's cakes 👀 she is gorgeous
What a goof
i watched this on mute
How much research do they do before actually making the food?? 🤔😓
She looks like lily from clevver it’s scary
Pain au chocolat, for sure!
I love that she is always smiling, positive, and laughing, she made me smile a lot. I really want to see more of her in future vids 😊
Alex you're adorable!
awesome job! I woulda just got some puff pastry and called it a day.
Pain au chocolat*
She's so pretty omg plus she have a best body
hahahaha i loved her, she inspires freshness
persever!
Chocolatine mes chères compatriotes
CHOCOLATINE for the most intimates
If I can give you an advice it's that you don't have to push a lot just roll on the dough and with friction it's gonna be easier 😘and the fact is that it's not Chocolat croissant or pain au chocolat it's chocolatine 🤗
I love Tasty..u r so pretty n adorable...i called its desperate croisant..hahaha...joking..but anyway ..im tasty lover..Big Hug From Indonesiaa..
PAIN AU CHOCOLAT c'est pas compliqué putain !!!
i feel so offended by all those americans calling that a "chocolate croissant" and the worst thing is that they think they are right??? stfu it's french, let us be offended it's part of our culture not yours. You have no right to tell us how it's called and that "gneugneu it's the same" because believe it or not but if you ask a "chocolate croissant" in france you will NOT get a pain au chocolat. And actually no, "the rest of the world calls them chocolat croissants" is just the US. Spain, Portugal, Italy, UK, Germany, Canada, Belgium, Swiss calls them pain au chocolat or chocolatine, even in Asia they call them pain au chocolat!  Telling us to stop being piss is like telling to japanese that sushi is called "fish on top of rice". You think it's normal because you have no traditional food in the US, and that's so wrong, educate yourself please
Croissant? What croissant?
She's so cutee 💓
When you've worked that hard to get it right. Yea go ahead and scarf them down..
i like her shes beautiful
Does anyone know what this music in 7:19 is?
hey ! In France we  are calling it "pain au chocolat" ;)
'Chocolate croissant'???? You sure?? You really sure that's not just pain au chocolat? Probably better at cooking than me though so I can't complain tbh haha
I hate these videos because it shows how the recipes are not as easy as they are presented. They fail over and over again, but the final video is highly edited to look perfect.
She cute ^^
She picked up that microwave with ease @ 2:31
Liked that a lot, I'd like to see a reoccurring segment 🤣
chocolate croissants ? are u serious ? bro its a fuckin pain au chocolat et pas chocolatine
I low key watch the tasty videos before bed with a full stomach to relax, appreciate the art, and fall asleep. Was actually excited to see the behind the scenes...but boy oh boy did this video stress me tf out! 😠 and the more she giggled while being awkward acting all cutie patootie, the more pissed off I got 😤 sheesh!!! Lesson of the story is, never watch tasty croissants 🥐 behind the scenes. Especially after hearing all the other passerby saying “never again” now I’m also like...yup I’m with you all. Never again! Lol
Chocolatine
PAIN AU CHOCOLAT . This fuc*ing americans man .
I really love these behind the scenes because it shows that the people are actual humans and not realistic robots
Im on my period right now and i need this DONT JUDGE ME
She’s so cute omg
a PAIN of a chocolate croissant.. amiright? xD
Is your ring from Pandora? If so I have the same one!
Vanessa
dear lord... And someone gets payed for this
this is my favorite *Tasty* vid ever
❤❤
chocolatine!
those are not croissants, but hey, they do look good
I struggled watching this as a professional baker.. so many fundamental mistakes. But they looked ok in the end. Nothing glorious. Why doesn't tasty actually hire professionals who know what they are doing?
Her. Dimples are so cute
*SEYMOUUUUUR*
Girrrrlll you need to wear an apron.
Oh my god Americans.. it is called "pain au chocolat" or " chocolatine" not "chocolat croissants": .
Hehe I love her
I really enjoy the Behind Tasty videos, sometimes even more than the actual outcome
07:19 she is a hottie
Damn she hella thicc
I had a similar experience the first (and last) time I made croissants. It was brutal and I didn't realize it was going to take THREE DAYS! So glad this was a behind the scenes video.
7:19 Just sayin...
she's so cute!!
Does she have her own channel? She’s lovely, all smiles, so cute....
I love these videos!  Who in the comments can actually cook?
Sorry but that is definitely  not a croissant... xD
That's a pain au chocolat u annoying fuck
IT'S A F*CKING "PAIN AU CHOCOLAT" FOR F*CK'S SAKE !!!!!!!!!!! STOP CALLING IT A DAMN CROISSANT!!!!!! I'm French by the way so sorry for the rudeness XD
07:19
*triggered french people*
she is so cute !! fun video :D
Prob very tasty from behind....
"I dont claim to be a good baker" Alex 2017.
"Support your local baker" I died
Chocolatine is life. 😍😍
Just a little note: it's not CO2, it's steam from the water content in butter that creates rise and layers in the croissants
How come you didnt share the recipe
Happy for her! Hahaha
So funny and lovely!!
Amo este canal
chocolatine svp
I wanna marry her... NOW
love you😍😍😍
Why did she make again the dough while could just add more flour? It's wasting...
Can someone please tell non french speaking people that the "ts" in croissants are silent?
I like *❤*
Alex is adorable, & I'm making these.
Alex is HOT!
Wait... they're not croissants but saccottini! :D
Who else thought that tasty producers were people knew how to cook/bake things before hand and then watched a few of these videos and thought “nope!”
I don't know who she is, but I love her
Well miss producer, its "Pain au chocolat", not croissant
My french teacher would not approve
Best Tasty video ever! Give us more! 😹
She's so loud the microphone is clipping
It's not pain au chocolate it's pain au chocolat
THAT’S NOT A CROISSANT THO French speakers only call them pains au chocolat
This is pain au chocolat 😂 chocolate croissants are completely different
this is so cringy.
That smile though hahahah! Grats!
soooo sweet und funny......i like it.....big hug
She has to cut the dough into triangles before rolling it
She’s so pretty 💛
No shit Sherlock!!!!
Someone named sherlock
Wanna know what would be hilarious
I can see constipation coming
I forgot that she was even baking after the first attempt.....she is hot as hell !!!!
I love her shes so cheerful
She's the cutest and I love her energy!! Good job Alix <3
These videos are my favorite next to worth it!
She has a great personality, I enjoyed watching her than the recipe
She's really pretty 😊
Idk why but I was reminded of Lily Marston
Try pastry margarine?
Idk this video is good and everything. But damn she's so beautiful and seems like an awesome person. Wanna be bffs with her.
Honestly I've Made it once, and absolutely never fucking again..
I admire this girls optimism and tenacity, I would've given up at the first one
aww, she's soo cute I wanna be her friend!
I like the final show  she looks like she saved the world 😂😂😂😅
I die inside whenever an American pronounces croissant like that
Can u make aligot.......plsssssss
Here is an easier way of making them: 1.  Buy the butter pastry dough pre-made 2. Roll it out and cut it in to triangles 3. Put a piece of chocolate into each one 4. Roll it up Boom.
This by far is the best video yet.... because this is what cooking is about messing up and having to do it over and over and over again... Additionally, it helps others when they actually witness someone else having a terrible time making something that's not that easy to make.... this video is definitely worthy enough to earn me pressing the subscribe button and ringing the bell...
I absolutely love these
You is a pretty guys!love your chocolate!
I love her!!! She's awesome! This the reality lol everyone makes it look easy!!
I don't know what it is but I LOVE her she's so adorable.
Pain au chocolate
Bitch those are pain at chocolat (yes it’s French)
What's up everyone! If you have some spare time to watch a new YouTuber then come head over to my channel and fill free to watch some videos and support!
I AM IN LUV WITH THIS VID!!
That bitch is very generic looking,  homogenized.
I think I just fell in love with her 💞
My dream is to work with tasty
She is so cute
Aww that was cute ! Great personality !
Bwhat a waste of time and ingredients, you should have done a little bit more research
My face when the chocolate croissant turned out to be a pain au chocolat all along.
She's so Cute 😍
She's so cute, such a great personality.
i think she's cute. and tasty too.
Before I started watching them on YouTube, i watched on Facebook and thought it was one family doing this with a little girl and boy
Thick blonde cooking... I'm in.
2:13 try not to take it out of context
I'm so happy for you ! Literally crying 😭😀😊
Could I work for tasty in 4 years?
Couques au chocolat
God I love them extra thicc. So beautiful
basic research: PAIN AU CHOCOLAT.
Good except for saying GD. Too pretty to be saying ugly words like that.
She looks like a normal and less annoying version of Trisha Paytas
she cute
Me when i try to be à chef
I never knew the process of making tasty videos but after watching this my mind was blown away by the effort and time they spend just to provide us feasible videos to learn at. Nice job tasty crew👍 Thumbs up for that
2:14 that white hand on her ass, sexual assault at buzzfeed confirmed.
Chocolate Croissant ? Pain au chocolat plzz
Funny how they use premade pastry dough for everything, except this one time....
I would smash She thicc
5:34 me when I remember that tomorrow is Monday
I don’t ever want to make a croissant now. Haha I just don’t have the patience
Really yummy
That's pan aux chocolat.. not sure croissant 😕
oh em gee , shes so pretty  lol
Shes thicccc!
She could have just used a recipe from the start
Les gens c'est un PAIN AU CHOCOLAT pas une chocolatine ni un croissant au chocolat..geez, get it together!
its not a croissant wtf 😂😂
4:09 whose there behind?
Alex is very sweet. Put a smile on my face. Bad editing though at @7:19, she doesn't deserve that.
7:20 omg she is so cute funny and swag
She bakes like I do...by the seat of her pants lol  I have a similar battle going with macrons .
those aren't chocolate croissants they're called pain au chocolat
Sexc
When i roll my Pains au Chocolat i let them rest for 15 - 20 minutes to puff a little bit THEN bake them
Anybody else in the comments is French living in France and wondering WTF is a chocolate croissant ?????? We already have internal problem with southerners tying to call pain au chocolat, chocolatine so please Américains stay away from our food and they names and put some RESPEK on it !!!
Girl you're really positive, and I appreciate that. btw you *THICC*
I clicked on this video hoping tasty will show me a way to make them without going insane. I tried to make them twice and swore to never do that again.  It’s good to know that everyone else feels pretty much the same!  I have a lot of respect for her!
Failure is the stepping stone of success...🖒
My mom made it in 1 day...
It's pain au chocolat not chocolate croissant
I'm French and it pains me that the e nglish call it a so called "chocolate croissant" it's pain au chocolat like please change the title it's misleading
Good to see the professionals make mistakes also! She should've invited Martha Stewart to the show to help her out!
I love her personality!! She seems so sweet and adorable
I wanna meet the "oh yes" guy!
Pronounced as krwa san
She so so adorable!!!
She’s adorable 😍
Can u make original turkish delight and baklava?
shes cute, kinda looks like a fat caity lotz
Aren’t you supposed to put layers of butter in there?
awe she's so pretty 😍i really wasn't focused on the croissant she looks so happy
SHES SO GORG WTF
It's called Pain au chocolat, NOT Croissants -_-
2:16 be honest... whats the first thing that came to mind?  😂😂
Oh this is pure gold, I love seeing raw footage of behind the scene's bloopers; I could watch this all day!!!😂😂😂
Anyone turned on the auto english and saw "jongguk" when she misspoked ?
I studied pastry arts in culinary school. Made croissants in school for exams. Never made them again. Too much work.
Not a croissant
does are not croissants. I love your chanel but pleas but correct with your terminology. does are paint au chocolat, roughly translated: bread of chocolat
It's Pain Au Chocolat. In France we never say chocolate croissant. EVER. It's Pain au Chocolat or Chocolatine.
Elle est belle
Alex you are a very pretty woman! : )
Awwwww she's so cute
she's cute 😍
Where is this place??
WHATS HER NAMEEEEE
J'apprecierai mieux mon croissant la prochaine fois que j'en mange un
shes so fuckin sexy
And in france we have to dicuss the pain au chocolat eand chocolatine
I love the tattoo 1:15 ❤
Isn't that basically a pain au chocolat ? Never hear of chocolate croissant before, and I am French.
mmmm... are croissant supposed to be rolled when cut into triangles?? That is not called a croissant, at least in most European countries (France, Spain, Protugal...).
Damn.. next time I'll pay with my mouth shut
This reminds me of that one specific vine where the guy gets startled.
She's beautiful !!!
Chocolate croissant... never cringed so hard. Girl, that’s pain au chocolat.
I've never heard anyone here say 'chocolate croissant'. This girl seems like the sweetest and she's so pretty!
Absolutely beautiful and can finally make crossaints! Some of these comments are disgusting.
https://tasty.co/recipe/homemade-chocolate-croissants-pain-au-chocolate
I think croissant should look like a crescent
Love these behind the scenes vids !!
Damn she's thicc
Pain au chocolat :)) my mom used to be a chef :)))
stop the debate and stop insulting people who don't say "pain au chocolat", you can say it however you want there's no correct pronunciation! it just depends on where you live but don't call people "assholes" or tell them that they're wrong just because they say it differently than you 😑
They are called pain au chocolat not chocolat croissants. Just saying from a French point of view bc that’s what they’re called in France 🇫🇷
CHOCOLATINE PUTAIN
Does she have instagram?
I have no idea who your "significant other" is my dear, but tell them i said they are REMARKABLY lucky.......
Vegans hate Tasty, to all vegans get a job in a meat shop, eat a fuckin bathtub of bacon and stop shit- talking in Tasty comments cause everyone has a different lifestyle so piss off and stop having a butthurt because Tasty doesn’t make vegetarian videos *peace*
Suffer! Note I'm in baking and pastry program in college. Aaahhhhhh I'm cringing so badly! Surprisingly during lamination (when fold dough and butter) I hated making danish dough more then croissant dough. Acually reverse puff might have been worst...
Some will say it is called "pain au chocolat" but it is "chocolatine".
7:22 accidentally drops them on the floor
Is that Nikkie Tutorials?
why is she trying to make croissants like this? grated in the butter, wtf? they aren’t even croissants, they’re pain au chocolat. do tasty producers even bother to research the foods before they make them? she’s sweet, but this is a disaster
Oh my god! She is beautiful ❤
hey she's perrrrty cute
She must have been the hottest girl in High school...
I succeeded in making of croissant in the first try!!  Don't give up!! I used the method where you placed a slab of butter in the middle and then folded it. With every fold, you gotta put it in the freezer and wait for 30mins and then take it out and fold it again. I live in a tropical climate so I had to turn on the air conditioning and consider every little aspect that could ruin it. Hope this works for anyone out there that wants to try it!!
Is this not actually called a pain au chocolat?
😀😀😀
She makes me not hungry.
Binging with babish did it in 1 try lmao
I made my own pastry once for egg tarts.. turned out great! but never again
that's not a croissant tho.. it's pain au chocolat
She’s so pretty
You are a bad cook
Okay so I have a question about the croissants.   what is the last naME OF THE PERSON BAKING THEM BECAUSE GIRLLLL
You’re so pretty! Wish I could look like you! 😊
Doing basic shit and expects applause and appreciation typical normie
IM FUCKING IN LOVE WITH HANNAH
That's not even a croissant it's a pain au chocolat.
She looks like Trisha Paytas
3:23
I made croissants once too, never again, i literally spent 2 whole days
I love this channel, good job guys
Come for the croissants and stay for the muffins 😛😛😛
Soo good to see Scott again!
You dont say ''chocolate croissants'' but ''pain au chocolat''
7:19
WHEN SHE CAME OUT OF THE KITCHEN WITH THE TRAY OF CROISSANTS AND SUNGLASSES I LOST IT 7:19
Love this girl and video
Is that true reason why so many compilations last days?
Youre supposed to cut them in triangles
She thicc as hell
It's not a chocolate croissant, it's a pain au chocolat!! A croissant is a whole different new thing!!!
Chocolate croissant? That's a fucking pain au chocolat. They don't even taste the same.
YOU MEAN PAN AU CHOCOLAT
you're voice is so nice <3
Team chocolatine  Les vrais comprendront
Chocolate Croissants? These are pan au chocolat
"Looking good DOUGH"
**pain au chocolat
If you guys want a simpler version of puff pastry, try Gemma Stafford’s video. It’s surprisingly simple to understand!
t h i c c
She THICC
Its french and we call it Chocolatine   #teamchocolatine
CAN ALIX APPEAR IN MORE BUZZFEED VIDEOS BC HER PERSONALITY IS SO CUTE I LOVE HER
She's a delight
Adorable and beautiful.
In french we call it «pain au chocolat»
who tf calls chocolade broodjes Chocolate croissants?
In France we call that a pain au chocolat or a chocolatine 😆
I really enjoy watching these behind the scenes videos.
6:26 'The butter will melt and create CO2' man these people need to get their shit together
When you grated that butter to directly put in the dough, I had to stop watching.  You guys, France have started wars for so much less. Please stop it.
Je suis française et les croissants viennent de France !  :)
I love alex
❤ I'm from Ukraine.  Thank you !
Oh my God! Best tasty video ever, that entrance with the hair flip is the key to good chocolate croissants! Errbody knows that, or buy frozen TraderJoes ones and pretend you made them just like we do!
Damn she is beyond Hot! What a voluptuous sexy woman.
she is so cute!
More Alex! That was great!
Where is the normal video?
As a master Baker im triggered by this.
WHY THE FUCK WERE YOU FREEZING THE DOUGH??
She should cool her marble
Chocolate croissants is such a weird name for them. They're not "crescents". Pain au chocolat makes more sense. Even chocolate pastries or something would be better. Side note, this lady is so fucking annoying.
I love this viedeo!!
Croissants are scary , they re loaded in calories and the butter is full of fat , i don t understand how ppl eat them
I refuse to ever make lamented dough ever again
yall should defenitly do more of these behind the scene vids they're gorgeous
rie on the side judging her hahaha
Very tasty maybe not more than once a week.  Eat a plant based diet for health and too lose excess weight.  Too many overweight people in this world.  Medical insurance should make these people pay more because they eat all this junk and fattening food.
I love these behind the scenes clips. I need more. Makes me feel less self conscious about messing up. It's trial and error.
Im on my to marry her
She really is cute and lovely♥♥♥
Honey, that’s Pain au chocolat! 🙄
We still don't know the guy who says "Oh Yes!!"
I like her so much
She fine as fuck
This is not a croissant... this is a pain au chocolat, also called chocolatine.
That is a beautiful body
She is so nice wtf
Video idea: Panini press recipes!
Best tasty video. Not going to try this though 🤣🤣
Did anyone get the first joke? I have no idea what it was
Alix is so sweet 😍
good job
I didn’t know it was so complicated in there
You should do more of these *behind the scenes* it's awesome 🙂
Are you going to finish that
I love your video
Yoooo you did it!!!!!🙌🏼❣️
I think i'm gay
7:19
Thats called "pain au chocolat"
*It makes no sense to enjoy making that when you know that the cattle were trapped for hours daily, with electronic devices on their body, their calves stripped away from them; all while living in an environment that is hazardous to their health. Remember the antibiotics; growth hormones, and pus that’s in dairy products (that includes butter)* be aware of your influence, channel
That first recipe she was trying was awful
Give her a bonus while we're at it
Subscribed
Can we get her @? 👀
YOOO I GOT SO HAPPY WHEN I SAW THAT YOUR NAME IS SPELLED LIKE ALIX BECAUSE I NEVER SEENED SOMEONE WITH OUR NAME .. I had to do a double take lmaoo . A part of me love my name even more ❤️🤗
This is called pain au chocolat
This is "Pain au chocolat"
Wow i never knew making these were this hard!!!
didn’t realize how much I needed a chocolate croissant in my life until now
actually its a "pain au chocolate" that you made not a croissant au chocolat ;)
This is literally me trying to make a boiled egg😂
The struggle to make croissants is soooo real! XD
I think she looks cute, just like Emilia Clarke (Khalesi of GOT)
“I earned these layers”  Same. Looks down at my stomach
Damn Alix is so bloody hot. That body is amazing.
Chocolat what ????
yall need to check the description before beating yourselves up over what it's actually called
more behind tasty vids with rie pls
"Support your local baker " idk its seems funny and sad haha
Looking at a thumbnail for a second I thought that Adele is cooking... Well, hello...
It's a Pain au chocolat (chocolate bread) not a chocolate croissant
She Thick 👌👌
omg she's so cute <3
These are my favorite videos to watch please upload more of them!!!!!
She seems fun to be around. Bubbly girl who likes to laugh
Ce n'est ni un croissant au chocolat ni un pain au chocolat encor moins une putain de chocolatine
She would be so hot if she wasnt fat
I freaking love tasty videos behing the scenes. You guys need to make more plsss😁😁😁😭💜💜💜💜💜
I probably shouldn't speak too soon
Amazing hahahahhahahahaha
She thick 😂😂😂
I make croissants in the dark. Hot lights and croissants don’t mix
Say good bye SIMPLE
Your hairstyle so pretty, Alex!! <3
Hahah “if I learned anything... support your local baker” 😭
"Never give up, never surrender!"
I was eating while she tripped and I spit out my food😂😂
Omg these comments... "it's not a chocolate croissant it's a pain au chocolat" nobody cares... just watch the gd video 😩
Alex cute 😍
Again, those are "Pains au chocolat"
You so beautiful!!!
French people, get over the pain au chocolat thing... and for the prononciation, just dont say the "t" at the end and you're good
I literally want to hug her forever she is so cute!
She is funny and cute
These kind of videos should be called David Seymour’s right our recipies aren’t that easy
"many of you may be wondering why I haven't just given up, I've wondered the same thing myself, but it's my job, so I can't" - me as a student
I wonder how many days this took to film, since people have been asking for behind the scenes for maybe a few weeks (from what I've seen).
damn she is hot.my dreamgirl
i love to see the story behind all the tasty videos 😄
Why didn't you watch Jacques Pepin do it?
She's so cuuute I love her!
How can I sign up for tasty? I would love to cook all day.👨‍🍳🎂
It’s a pain au chocolat.......
When you watched the Worth It Japan videos before watching this and notice Rie working in the background
Highly annoying.  Seeing more of this quirky woman trying to be cute and perky for the camera, just forget showing anything note worthy of making the actual recipe.  Unsubscribing
she looks like loeybug
Great video but god damn! She looks good.
Emilia Clarke
okay, so the video isn't great or accurate, but I'm living for the look on her face when they worked 😭🙊
But the last one was the true method the first one grating the butter is a cheat way
She is damn cute !
That's the cheat way of making croissants because the traditional way takes from 1 to 3 days and a lot of folding and rolling and resting and buttet
That's a chocolate puff ....not a croissant.  Croissants have yeast in their dough..
nice & Yummy
Just waste 8mins of my life
Can you make a after work meal prep video plz
Ok so just clarification, chocolate croissant isnt a thing, pain au chocolat or litteraly bread with choolate however is indeed a thing.
I feel insulted to my core, it’s a pain au chocolat  Every time she said chocolate croissant a part of me died  All of France is crying rn IT’S A DAMN PAIN AU CHOCOLAT
She's so cute
I like her voice
*T H I C C*
i think im in love
Looking at people think she is pretty make me feel like anyone in the world will be pretty in someone’s eye...
hopefully i get that joy of baking a croissant  11 times of failure and counting! never give up !  sad but i need to nail this pastry! T^T
How does a food company hire someone who doesn't know how to bake... just watching the gbbo told me grating the butter in wasn't a good idea. This is why I don't trust Tasty...
it doesn't make co2. it makes steam. WOW. like..... no chemical reaction bruh. i did this on first attempt in hs 10 years ago without help. shameful tbh
aah stop I could have dropped my croissant
She dumb thicc
ohmygod this is hilarious.. 'where's the douuugghh' 'I earn this layer!' jdkeb I am laughingg!
I am ready to see the pain au chocolat vs chocolatine comments
God this deserves a thumbs up just for you even attempting to make croissants without baking experience lol. I've tried twice and both times ended in abject failure, but this is why I like cooking and not baking lol. (I suspect it's the fact that I'm objectively a poor baker, because my hands lose a LOT of heat to whatever they touch, and invariably butter melts the moment I touch it)
I love theses videos
Everyone, look at the description
What is wrong with that woman in the thumbnail
Least informative video ever. Actually even largely misleading. People already pointed out the wrong name of what is "prepared". The end result, out of the oven, after supposedly days of trials is laughable. Put this sh#$ in erotic comedy and you'll be fine.
She is absolutely adorable! Make more of these :)
Shes adorable...but I have to make a finished product in one go and usually do!... Wonder if tasty is hiring?
Lmfao i love her!
wow those look really good and the croissants too
It's not a croissant. It's pain au chocolat which literally means bread with chocolate.
7:20 her moment of triumph. :D
I can attest to how hard those are! I didn't even have mine filled when I did them in school and they were so hard! I cut myself for the first time in class making those things!
Chocolate  What ? I'm french and you guys offended me theirs a great debate about how it's called in French but nobody call them chocolate croissant !
I'm just kidding she was already in that I guess
Rie! Anyone know rie? Tasty cook off? Anyways i saw her
I love her struggling, and Rie ever so calm in the background
this is a long lesson that is funny. lol
She’s the definition of my type
Wtf buff pastry doesn’t have yeast
HEY Y'ALL, DO YOU THINK THESE ARE CALLED PAIN AU CHOCOLAT????????? CAN'T TELL FROM THE COMMENT SECTION HONESTLY CAN SOMEONE TELL ME IF THESE ARE CALL PAIN AU CHOCOLAT?????
ALEX IS BAD AF
That smile tho 😍
oh dear woman....i want to have littles and cutes babys  whit you :D...tats, that body and that smile <3 Say hi to me and you Will make a man happy
"I deserve these layers." Yassss gurllll
I want to see Tasty Vlogs please!!
I've made croissants twice before and they are incredibly tough! But, it's a point of pride to make them and when they come out they are the most perfect things in the world. Almost makes the three day work worth it. Almost
Alix is Highkey wifey material
The behind the scenes videos are my favorite!
People are you aware pain au chocolat directly translate to chocolate bread and therefore can be used interchangeably with the the term chocolate croissant in the context of this video? Honstly these comments are ridiculous.
Oh my god I love how absolutely accurate this whole thing was
I like her she is cute and funny= hot
Sooooooooooo... Where is the crosissants!?! Those are NAPOLITANA!!!! -_-
shes the sexiest plus size woman ive seen in a while
omg Im laughing so hard
Chocolatine #vivelesud
Id totally take her out on a date! So adorable!
What is her name! <3
I like how they use store bought croissants for their thumbnail and at 8:12
“Support your local baker” I literally just died
Please make more of these behind the scenes/uncut videos
Love your videos already but definitely more stuff like this! So cool!
T H I C C
If you make the butter into a giant rolled out thing. Then wack the dough it makes it easier to roll out. Viennoiserie is trained thing. It is not easy to do. I am like alexis....did it once in culinary school and never again.
Lol love it! Y'all are so silly. Please do more!
omg shes so pretty!!!
That Distortion though! Cmon!
Love her! Adorable! She makes me love my body!
“It’s pain au chocolat” Ok so you can speak 3 French words. Congrats one like a know it all...let them live
make cinnamon roll croasants
7:19 PUSSY SLIP
Are you gonna finish that C.R O I S S A N T?
Hot girl more from her Videos pls !
buzzfeed just looks like a big classroom
She is so so so so so so cute..  It's called pain au chocolate...😉
this girl is kinda cute.
i didn’t know alex was a tasty producer‼️
I understand that the French people don't like it when Americans harass their culture with misnaming their pastries (oh what a crime), but at the point where a majority of the commenters feel the need to correct Tasty, it's just redundant. Now, we don't even care what it's called, we just care that it tastes good and took hard work to create. Why do you have to ruin such a good thing...  PS: I harbor no malicious intent towards my fellow French people, so please, don't target me because I said something that no one else did. I hope you have a blessed day :)
Food is lifer
I hate regular rolling pins with a passion, french rolling pins are the way to go 👍
That pronunciation 😂😂😂
She reminds me of Jennifer Lawrence :)
I'd love to see behind tasty when Rie was the cook, like she did in the background
9 days to do one dish? Can I apply.
Anyone saw the thumbnail and thought that's one fucking huge croissant ?
I thought those were giant crossaints in the thumbnail.
Guys, they're called Pain Au Chocolat according to the comment section.. Sheesh
I was wondering if there was another name for these things, aside from chocolate croissants, but after reading through all the comments, it's clear that "CHOCOLATE CROISSANTS" is the one and only proper name for these.
Also made these once ummm yeah never again
Am I the only one who think she’s cute asf
Lmao the butter doesn’t create CO2.
i'd eat her chocolate croissant any day! 😏
Alex is hot. . . . .
You inspire me... Thank you
girl version of Leonardo 😳
the way she walks through a mostly empty room at 7:22 reminds me of the scene in Wanted where (spoilers) Wesley finally catches the bobbin on the loom.
I’m not really into plus size women but damn she kinda hot
Beautiful layers..
What’s her name?? Instagram time
I'd like to eat her chocolate croissant
She is the perfect girl .. she can cook and has a fat ass 😍😍😍
Body goals 😍
Hahaha this girl is so, so me. But Alex you've been quoted and it will go down in history now.  " I don't claim to be a good baker." - Alex
This is awesome! Your personality 😍
Croissants are supposed to be triangle right?
Whats her full name????
Is she Ausie or something?
I scrolled threw about 100 comments, and no one comments that butter makes steam, not CO2
Her expression was of million dollars
Wow when your so proud you do a hair flip but no one sees you #Embarresed
8:08 Support your local bakers LOL
Hahaha she is too cool and sweet!
Loved it when she came out like a star... and then tripped
LOOOL everyone in america calls them chocolate croissants
what's her IG
I love these behind tasty series!! <3 <3
She's so beautiful, *ahhhhhhh.*
That's called chocolatine.
Mhmm she's thicc
I agree with supporting your local Baker.
Thats pain au chocolat
7:19 *drops plate*
If she had her own cooking show I'd be watching it daily!
I want to flower that ass 😁
The intro is harder than the chocolate croissant!?!?! Yay!
to those who hate and complain:   she literally said she's not a baker in the beginning of the video. At least she tried to make them. :(
She's really cute
WOW tasty managed to post 24 videos in a row without disgusting, vegan food #FuckTheVegans
Tried made it once.. and I understand what she went through.. you need to have a skill/touch to make a (not even perfect) puff pastry
Part of her job is to document how bad she is at her job.  Let that sink in.
So many people triggered by it being called a chocolate croissant. Calm down. Yes, it's not called that in French, but that's what it's called in English. And there's nothing wrong with that.
I wanna be her friend
Congratulations on your triumph in your personal Baking Battle! I give you so much respect for not giving up! They look amazing and you should be proud of your willingness keep trying. Did you chill the marble where you were rolling?
When you see Scott!!😊👌
I made these before and didn't have an issue.... AM I THE CHOSEN ONE!?!
Pls make an almond croissant video!!!
she's thicc
THICC <3
看到美食就要赞 喜欢
Hi Alex.....       Wow.. The rolling pin ends bent... You've got this Alex👍👏 They look great to me.. 🎊🎉💫🌟✨ the final day ✨ before you rolled it i could/did ser the individual layers of flakes🌟🌟   Bon appetit Alex brava...
< trader joe's frozen chocolate croissants
The whole internet is proud of you and yours... chocolate Cros.. Chocolate crois..chocolate... whatever.. we are proud. 😁
We need more behind the scenes vidios
So funny when she walked out wearing shades
are these people using the term "producer" as a "creator?" there seems to be ALOT of tasty "producers"
Love them!!!
Pain au chocolat ya mean  a croissant is named a croissant because it is a crescent a pain au chocolat is not a crescent
The first couple attempts look like delicious, delicious pepperoni rolls 😋
4:24 i dough'nt know
Nobody died. It is nobody’s birthday. It isn’t my birthday. Can I get likes anyway?
She has a really great attitude and can do spirit. She is welcome to come over to my place and cook whatever her heart desires. She would so much fun to be in the kitchen with. You go girl.💗
Chocolate crip cookies?
she is gorgeous. wow
Like your channel n love u love from lahore pakistan
Dear just love from lahore pakistan
feel Happy 😍
I actually know how to make it lollll Not that hard just a lots a lot a lot of work hahahaha
Perfect video!!)) Haha)) I enjoyed a lot😂
Too funny...looks good
Good trick use frozen butter not sure about how it would effect the baking but if u are grating butter u should freeze it
She is so cheerful and energetic. Love the patience.
2:20, that’s what she said
Why not just use pre-made croissant dough. I doubt most people have the time/energy to make croissants from scratch
Wow i never knew they are shooting it so professionally
shes so pretty& cute!!
Wow great job all that hard work paid off!💪👍👍👍
I see the layers but i also see them curvers 👀👀👀
I have a challenge for you guys, try making a recipe for Trinidadian black cake/rum cake. Basically its just normal cake with fruits and rum in it, I would like to see you guys try to make it
Who the girl?
She seems so nice and funny! I really liked this type of video; they should do more of these! (Also, yes, we get that it is pain au chocolat not a croissant)
04:44 damn.. who dat? 😍
After the endless amounts of tasty videos I have watch its only till now I have thought about this... who the hell is the person who says "ohhh YES!" at the end of every video?!?!
Calling them chocolate croissants is an insult (I'm not even French) They should always be called by their proper french name Pain Au Chocolat out of respect
Wait, can somebody verify this for me? Aren’t those pain au chocolat?   On another note, I’d totally be her friend.
She's hot!
that's not a croisant
Its a chocolate sausage roll!
I've made pain au chocolat before.  It's not that difficult if you read and follow the instructions.
I'm gay for her
It's nice to see behind the scenes and know that the chefs struggle like we do. Thanks Tasty : )
"chocolate croissant" what the fuck??? its called CHOCOLATINE
Alex thicc af
Those ain't chocolate croissants, they are pain au chocolat, croissant means cresent, and refers to the shape.
Rie in the background <3
Croissants aren't THAT hard to make, I'm a baker and I aced them the first time, but it's her job to cook so you'd think she'd be able to make them okay, right? Not trying to throw shade or anything, but she probably would've been more successful if she wasn't trying to cheat her way through it, you know?
Why doesn't tasty ever need any of their doughs to develop gluten?
Good job..  I love that you hung in there..  You did Excellent..
Tasty is made to look easy
jajaja you so funny and i like the video
please make more behind tasty pleaseeeee
You have a crotch shot 7:19 when u kick open the door in that tiny dress
She's pretty
99.99% of all comments are..........     People saying it's pain au blah blah
1:33  "I don't claim to be a good baker"                               -alix
This girl have a really beautiful smile :)
T.H.I.C.C
I was rooting for her the whole time, I'm glad it came out well in the end!!
Are you going to finish that Croissannnt??
Why did no one tell her that's not a croissant?
More of her plz
She seems super fun...such great energy.
Were you using regular butter? The trick is to use a european butter that has less moisture.  They look delicious though!
French person speaking: well done. You've not picked the easiest recipe...and I would have these croissants any day :-)
Wow she's so beautiful
Good job Bravo
Starbucks calls them Chocolate Croissants. Yes, the French term is Pain au Chocolat, but are we French? No. If you want to make it easier on yourself, freeze the layer of butter, and if you can work on a chilled Marble slab. Even a chilled rolling pin. Keep everything as cold as possible without freezing and you will make it easier. In the beginning she was banging the dough with a rolling pin. This is actually a practice that makes it easier to flatten the dough.
She looks like the plus sized version of Emilia Clarke . Sweet
it's called Pain au chocolat but okay
She's gorgeous!
Keeping the dough cool is going to be hard if you live in a tropical country :/ I want to try someday...      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6ycw7p9-bE
That is a pain au chocolate...
Congrats Alex!
8:18 I would have loved if that was my lips touching hers (Good thing we  both live in LA)
Very funny video. Amazing👍
She looks like Blake Lively
Me like: maybe if you cut in triangles the shape would have been better lol
8:42 oml did she really just drop em
this is the cutest human being ever
What's her name ?? She is pretty cute
Those are not croissants and I ain't even French
SHES SO PRETTY SHE HAS SMILING EYES
https://youtu.be/nW0gHvfUXco
I like her, she's so cute 😄💙💜

why doesnt she just use premade croissant dough bc tasty uses that a lot for other stuff why not use it for what its made for
PAIN AU CHOCOLAT is not that hard to make. I aced it on my first try a couple of years ago. This is ridiculous.
Pardon me but damn do all Tasty producer's look as tasty as you? Hold up I got one more, are you sure you're not a baker because your buns say otherwise.😂 Good job on the video by the way I can tell it was a pain in the a**
I feel your pain girl! I'm in culinary school and we had to make these recently..... I cried when I finally finished.
what's the name of the first song playing in the background
Even after seeing the shit she went through, people are more fucking concerned about the name she's calling them than the work she put in. An absolute fucking shame. Grown ass adults feelings the need to complain about trivial bullshit.
Where is the hot dude??? Hahaha jk
She’s so cute
I'm in love
Oh my god Alex is GORGEOUS! 😍😍😍😍😍
4:48 women can't bake. what are you even doing in the kitchen?... ;D that look.
Ok. Do more.
these are not croissants but good try anyway
Damn she thíckê
T H I C C
I would love to work for Tasty, you get such phenomenal tools at your disposal, the ability to learn in a proper environment, and it looks like a lot of fun
It’s called CHOCOLATINE
I get sad after every time I watch this because I know that it will be long before another video like this will come out :(
ARE YOU GOING TO FINISH THAT CROISSANT?
She's really cute. she looks alot like Chloë Grace Moretz.
It's called pain au chocolat :/
I don't have any yeast 😓
You learn that language in Tagalog Ang Sarap good accent ! Im a Filipino 😛
I feel like she should've just used a different recipe. my school had a super soft doughy one that worked the first time. it wasn't all that hard to roll out.
So much angry french in the comments 😂 But I'm with you guys ! Let's create an alliance between the pains au chocolat and the chocolatine to destroy those "chocolate croissants" !!!! Révolution !!!!!!!!!!
please make more videos like this! 😍
Does “behind tasty” means that it doesn’t taste good
alex is pretty hot
PAIN AU CHOCOLAT bordel de merde
Hey! Not bad for the final first attempt. Though for better, crisper layers, I would suggest brushing off the excess flour that wants to sneak in when you fold in the layers of dough from the work surface. :)
CHOCOLATE CROISSANTS ???  Noooo it's pain au chocolat (chocolate bread) ! Don't complicate the situation !!! (Only the french will understand 😉)
So hilarious! That how I cook - try and try again until it gets good 😅😄.  Hope you make another bakery attemp soon ;)
She is so cute love how she didn't give up!
OMG I LOVE HER
Do you not know what they’re actually called?
*C H O C O L A T I N E*
Can this be a weekly thing, I honestly find these more interesting than the actual vids lol
Did anyone see may in the background
That is the shortest dress I've ever seen on a big woman.
It's called a "pain au chocolat" you uncultured fucks
1:38 rie sighting!
Forget croissants. Alex got cakes yo
she certainly is a tasty producer...
Congrats Alex! Good job! I’m glad you didn’t give up. They look tasty.
PAIN AU CHOCOLAT !!!!
she’s so cute 😂
Make more behind tasty videos
She is FIIIIIIIIIINE
I loved the beginning
Who else saw her spreading softened the butter at 0:39 and immediately knew that this was going to be bad?
OMG I love her 💕😂
"chocolate croissant"... My french soul is puking blood rn.
Yeshhhh behind tasty
This is the kind of video that we need to see more of.
pain au chocolat ou chocolatine ?
How do you work for tasty and aren't a professional?
I wanna this now😭😭
She is beautiful. And yea, practice make perfect. You know what I mean.
sigh americans only thinking they know it all, that's not a FUCKING croissant that's a pain au chocolat, or chocolatine, et it's pronounced KRWASSON, not KRWASSONTTTSSS so cringy
Are you going to eat that croissant?
This is how you make peace with france,give them frog legs salt,pepper,and garlic butter,a glass of red wine,a baguette with butter,and a regular croissant with butter.
2:16 nice hand job
Love her personality! Lol
1:44 If you make your own crossiants, then you can eat them too bcoz you"ll have worked out -Alix No disrespect but this lady is dumb.
they use a 70D for these videos, I have a 60D, I should do these
OMG JUST LIKE STARBUCKSSSS YASSSS
Nutcracker music ahhh
T H I C C
aww she has such a cute laugh ☺️  they turned out so nice!!!
Why don’t they just have experienced cooks do this? I would hate to have her spend 8-9 days trying to make that
love these videos
I love how she came up like “ YAAAAASSS HOES, I DID WHAT NOBODY COULD HAVE DONE . #SlayingAtBaking
What *I* wanna know, is if anyone has ever dropped the pan while carrying it back to their station. Because I drop things alot.
Why do you call this a croissant ? This means crescent in french like for the moon
Hahahaha that final bake and your expression of joy seeing the layers in your croissants  is  me ...well my croissants did not  have that many layers like yours but I was jumping and tears rolled out my eyes too...👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👍
You mean PAN AU CHOCOLAT
Not hard, just long.
T H I C C
PAIN AU CHOCOLAT
holy shit this girl is annoying as hell
She looks JUST like the girl from the Charles Family on the big family cooking showdown!!!
Love to be her Gf......
Crossionts are yeasted this is just puff pastry
Its called pain au chocolat is not a croissant
"Pain au chocolat" please this is not croissant.
I love alix she's so funny
Pls let this girl come on more
She kinda thick👀
Why does she keeps looking up?
I think i just fell in Love with her :P
Pain au chocolat, not chocolate croissant
*Chocolatine. That’s how everyone says it in France. I live in France
call this place they are the best https://trung-nam.squarespace.com/
love this line of videos
#bingingwithbabish
The behind the scenes videos are great, it's cool to see the people behind the cameras.
I say Chocolatine
This is good dough?
7:20 dat entrance thooo
Just one thing,   It's called a ~pain au chocolat~
ITS PAIN AU CHOCOLAT OR CHOCOLATINE
Alton Brown solved the warm kitchen problem by putting sheet pans in the freezer so when the dough started to heat up, you pull a pan from the freezer and rest it on the dough for a bit to chill it.
Also known as a pains au chocolat
I could never work at tasty, throwing all the mistakes away and wasting all that food.
She’s so pwetty😍😍
Nothing better then a hot blonde making  croissant with a powder  hand prints on the ass lol good job not giving up.
I liked her journey from zero knowledge about croissant and learned proper method after. There's a scene that quite hilarious. First attempt looks like a pie crust, 2-3 attempt looks like a cookie or rolls (she literally spreading soft butter to make layers, lol). After all, throughout this video those struggles seemed really worthy with the final result.
Pain au chocolat not chocolate croissant 😭🙈😶
Don't they have pro chefs?
I just love her! She's so adorable!!
Such a beautiful women.
Isn't that a pain au chocolat? 🤔
7:17 When someone gives you something HELL good on your birthday
They're called pain au chocolats you fucking morons
On dit chocolatine les gonz
I love this girl!!
Buzzfeed is super cancer but the tasty team is pretty baller
I want to cook with her she seems like a ton of fun.
https://youtu.be/rCMRFwpkipI  Please guys like my uni project...it will help me a lot 😊
I need more from Alix! She's great!
A friend of mine actually made cinnamon bun croissants and they were the most delicious cinnamon buns ever because, instead of one layer of cinnamon and sugar swirled around, there was like 30 layers of it!
entre pain au chocolat et chocolatine et maintenant quoi croissant au chocolat ! où va le monde!
So I really wanted to make chocolate croissants...but then I watched this video! 🤷‍♀️
It's called pain au chocolat ptn
That’s a PAIN AU CHOCOLAT
Probably my most favorite buzzfeed video of all time. Not a baker but I could feel the struggle and couldn't stop laughing 😂
she must've wasted a _lot_ of food :(
Who is this girl? And how can i date her! Shes too cute! 😍
I think i'm in love
This was such a journey. I'm so proud of her!
You guys just killed it with whatever the name is just watch and learn idiots 🙄 blah
I have feelings for you
Pause exactly at 7:20
I don't  know what she is bitching about i made killer croissants first try
Damn she bad
Stroke the roller lol
I absolutely love this series!!!!
Wow, I remember when I made pastry dough for the first time...I thought I screwed it up so much but I did not give up. Came out perfectly! Never give up girl! Great vid guys
Did you censor the word goddamit? You're buzzfead is showing
support your local baker 😂
Yum
Chocolate croissants are one of my favorite foods 😍😫💕
All the french students correcting the name of the dessert, smh
the trick is it refrigerate the granite chopping board first
whether it’s Pain Au Chocolat or Chocolatine, we call it Schokotaschen here in Germany.
Damn...more of her, please :D
Anybody got her ig. Ahem.
All these stupid comments about what the croissants are supposed to be called.  The description even mentions what the name of the item is.
Cinnamon Roll Croissant? Yas gurl~
it's either pain au chocolat or chocolatine, not croissant au chocolat
i love these kind of behind tasty videos !!! keep it coming
I bet she is the person responsible for all those taco pasta recipes
Absolutely love this video!!! Alex is so much fun!!
I know the strugle. Made puff pastry from scratch once.. nevermore
these... arent... croissants
This was delightful
why do people want to change the the title to the real frech name like we are Americans we won't click on some random ass name we never heard of like all you people in the comments saying change the name go make you own video making those pastries and call it what you want in stead of talk about other people shit
Rae was in the background😂
Unsalted butter should be forbidden. 😥😭
Who else wants to see the the person who says “ ohhhh YEESS” ?  😂😫
Do watch this guys https://youtu.be/3bU_r8WkmY4 and subscribe too!!

French Baker would kill himself watching this video

She’s soooo cute  😩😍
Damn shes gorgeous
7:19 I see London I see France
Omg one of the shittiest supermarket always sells these, amazing! They may be the worst in everything they sell, but everyone knows they always deliver with the bread
Thicker than a bowl of oatmeal
She is so hot!
I actually make them differently at my work
I don't wanna see you failing. Please don't make a video if you can't make it successfully.
I bet all of France is offended by that title X/
She is sooooo cute, even the darkest of bikers couldn't resist her smile :)

Wow, that is some CLICK BAIT😋
i would love to eat her croissants
The people LOVE Alex! Give us more of Alex. She is so sweet.
this was hilarious
it's not called croissant but a chocolatine in french (une chocolatine en français)
Pain au chocolat
thats a pain au chocolat bruh
This was seriously funny but the fact she didn't give up... loved every bit of this and oh the chocolate croissant loved amazing :) yes the final 1s
I LOVE BEHIND TASTY VIDEOS KEEP EM COMING
So do the people who work for tasty, are they not chefs/bakers?
I love it
Needs salt
C'est un pain au chocolat ,bande d' inculte d'anglais!!
That Rie shade 😂😂😂 but aww Alix is an angel :') we need to see more of her!
The pains au chocolat are more easy to make if you use the right type of butter which is call "beurre de tourage" or "beurre sec" because it don't melt so easily.
She is beautiful!! OMG! I love her smile...seems like she has a really nice personality.
Stop it’s not chocolate croissant it’s Pain au Chocolat.
You take 9 days to make fucking croissants? Just follow a recipe.. it's not rocket science..
Also check out Live me app..
Why there's no one talking about quakson down here?? 😂
Google is creepy! I just bought one of these lesson 2 hours ago and now its showing me how to make them! Stay out of my head
PAIN AU CHOCOLAT PUTAIN
I'm ready to taste it tonight baby... Yum..😋
she thicc 😮
those arent even croissants those are pain au chocolats
Pain au chocolat you mormont
You made me drop my croissant
4:50 HIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII SCOTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT YOU CAN FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCCCCCCKKKKKKK MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP
Alex unsolicited advice get a french rolling pin and never grate your butter into the dough. Cut the butter into squares but make sure it is very cold.
Flour hand on that booty @3:33 tho! 👌👌👌
I'm not even joking a little.... Alix is one of the most beautiful women I have ever seen!... And the croissants look good too.
Yo Seymour
i can’t be the only person who thought this was Trisha Paytas
2:17 Perverted Camera person is Perverted
it's so nice to see the human side of this perfect channel!! dam their recipes are soooo delicious and look way too perfect! fantastic presentation, each time!!  kudos to your channel and all the people behind it :)  God Bless!
So you don’t have to be a good cook to work for Tasty?
Stop with chocolate croissant !! Its 'pain au chocolat'
Aw, she's so cute.
THESE ARE "PAIN AU CHOCOLAT" AND NOT "CHOCOLATE CROISSANT" OR WHAT THE FCK WHATSOEVER (please at least change this title, as a french guy I feel insulted)   PS: lol you guys american are feeling so triggered, we all know you have no culinary culture (except donuts?), but please, at least try to respect ours lol. By the way, these pains au chocolat (and not "chocolate") exactly look like the ones we buy in bakeries (:
She's pretty AF😍😍
Does anyone wonder what they do with the failed batches? That's a lot of food waste, But I still LOVE TASTY!!
The best video soooo far!! 😍
Pain au chocolat !! Not chocolate croissant. :0
Damn she is thiccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc
If you're going to make another country's recipe, at least name it RIGHT. It's a "pain au chocolat". Nobody will make a hotdog and call it a sausage bread...
I am all for making things from scratch, but puff pastry is something I get from the store. It's just not worth the efford...
I love Rie in the background looking so confused
She looks like Khalessi
Thats not chocolate crossaint. Il est pain au chocolat
she's lovely i like her 😂💕
If you EVER say that is a "Chocolat croissant" in France, you gonna be beated so hard. There's a civil war between the followers of the "Pain au chocolat" and thoses heretics of "Chocolatine".
Why don’t they wear aprons? You know- so they don’t get flour stains *on their shirts*
It's called "pain au chocolat" 😂
Omg😨😨😨if we try that at home without lookin at the mistake  Poor us😀😀
Mate it’s called a pain au chocolat
This the cutest and entertaining tasty video I’ve ever watched!!! 😍
she is really fat
That's not a chocolate croissant it's called pain au chocolat (chocolate bread)
In spanish these are called napolitanas😅
My fellow french from the north will hate me, but it's called "Chocolatine" (pronounced: choco la teen) :)
It's croissants an we say croisan the s,t and s is silent
I LOVE these behind tasty videos😅💖
respect ☺️🙌🏻 that was hard work and determination yo
Those who you call croissants au chocolat are «petits pains au chocolat» or chocolate little  breads?? Sorry but i just can't help myself that's because i love to call Sun the Sun and moon the moon maybe?!? Anyways your video is awesome and so funny 👍
Haha! The intro seems to be harder than making chocolate croissants :D
She is funny, freaking adorable.... and she can cook. We have a winner here ladies and gents !
more behind tasty please!!!!!!!!!!!! I just love watching them😊
That's not even a chocolate croissant it's a pain au chocolat
It's a chocolatine
That's not a croissant, i don't know the actual name in french because i'm not french but in italy we call it "fagottino al cioccolato"
Ooo she has the same arm tattoo as Binging with Babish. I think. Nice.
7:19 😳
Anyone else low-key triggered they called it a chocolate croissant…
Its called Pain Au Chocolat. This is not a chocolate croissant. I'm usually not the one to be complaining under Tasty's videos but this is a ridiculously stupid mistake. Now you're gonna have to throw the whole video away tbh
She thick
Sorry but I couldn't finish the video... was looking for a recipe but to much joking around.  I totally got lost.
Not croissants - they’re pan au chocolat. Laminating the dough is tricky and must be done quickly and gently.
panties 7:18
It's called *PAIN AU CHOCOLAT*
Was I the only one who laughed throughout the video😂
*Anyone else notice Rie in the background?* ❤❤❤
I made them one time    but never again 😂😂
its a pain au chocolat :(
Can you guys make more behind tasty
QUACKSONSSSSSSSS (hollander? anyone?)
Pain au chocolat,putain, pain au chocolat.
I like her smile , cute 😍
It’s a pain au chocolat ??
I want to marry her!!! :')
This was hilarious! 😂
ahhh Alix......crush mode activated! ha!
Do they not call them pan au chocolat
X3 hehe
We need this but macaroons version
Yuuuuummmmmmmm
She's so cute and sweet omg I wanna be friends with her
I really like watching the Behind Tasty series.
Pain au chocolat ou Chocolatine ?
If tasty videos are so hard to make why do you guys make it seem so easy?😑
I love behind tasty💙
Looks like such a fun job!!!!
7:19 WHATS GOOD BITCHES
Those behind the scenes videos make me wonder how many attempts the take to cook the food. I just pray not of it gets wasted and still eaten. Throwing away food is just a no-go
I love chocolate croissants soooo much I want to eat them soooo badly
This video was awesome and I loved seeing the mistakes made in the process. It showed the baker learning and her triumphs had me applauding her while I watched. I also learned how to make puff pastry rather than just get it from the store and I appreciate the local bakers even more now.
82% of comments: chocolatine/pain au chocolat war 16% of comments: she's hot  2% of comments: looks good c:
It should say making Pain Au Chocolat
this gave me anxiety
haha I actually never thought that behind the scenes would be like this xD 😂
KWASSON
Respect to tasty....
"I have never made chocolate croissants before" ...you still haven't, you made pain au chocolat 😂
Sooooooo stupid video 😏 Fat women makes what she can’t to make......
Yay Alex
...Tasty producer?
I got love at first sight 😂 hahaha I love Her!
Madre mia lo que hay que ver... Llaman en serio Croissant de chocolate a unas Napolitana​s... Qué insulto a la gran gastronomía francesa
The fact that she says chocolate croissant bother me so much argh
If she actually lost some weight she actually be really attractive because she has the face for it but then again it can be caked on make up,,
I finally found out what they're called! Over here they're called pain au chocolat and there's no English translation
SHE THICCCCC
These are called PAIN AU CHOCOLAT. Damn,we have fought for our right to not call these "Chocolatine".
did u say chocloate?
I thought it was Trisha Paytas in the thumbnail 😂😂😂
This is The best behind The scenes tasty Video ever
I love Rie so much.
Can you make 10 batches of those croissants for me?
Pain au chocolat or Chocolatine, this is the question. Or not : chocolatine in the TRASH ! 3:x
Wtf its called a chocolatine
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
She seems so sweet😍
She's so attractive
I love how you just stuck with it and never gave up!
I'm wondduring if like they asked a French how is that pastry thing called , and the French: You don't want to go there ...
Damn she'd be a total knockout if she lost a few pounds
I want one, but only if you make it!
She smiled all the time. Makes me happy.. lol
Please wear apron
Just make the Croissants outside where it's cold
This is a puff pastry dough not a Croissants dough.
Good Job 👍
The real name is "Chocolatine"
يا ريت لو في ترجمة
they look more like Pain Au Chocolats...
Man that laugh crying moment was adorable af
Good job Alex  I know you’ve gave your best in these  and you worked hard I’m so happy that you didn’t give up  🍫🍫
Awesome. Where's the completed edited video that shows us how she made it from scratch?

Do they even eat all of the food
