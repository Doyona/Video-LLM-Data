I Have TV Philips and Control GE CL6 wich is the code? I try to do but dosent work the control
This is the most difficult remote that I have ever worked with.  It will not pair at all with a Contour cable box and it won't pair correctly with my Apple streaming box.  And I have tried various approaches.
I have used this video literally 10 times over the past couple years! Thanks for everything 🎉
Any other sony codes? i tried all the ones in the pamphlet and none work.
So i program my remote, but some buttons don't work. Im so disappointed.  😢
What the code for Royal D series smart 32?
Thank you for your video! I used your directions on my GE universal remote, which has the following identifying information on the back: "33709 CL6 7252" for my Sony Blu-ray/DVD player, model BDP-S2500, using the universal identification method you outlined. The remote found the code on the second code identification cycle.
Literally was thinking we needed a new TV until I found this video!! Thank you!
Anybody has the samsung tv code ?
Thank you, this video helped me a lot
THANKS THIS WORKED
Thank you 😊
The link isn’t working no more?
Thanks for your video! Helpful 😊
Did 6 different thing pause on the screen with all the codes screenshot it it zoomed in for my TV. The first code I put work for my remote.
Sony Blu Ray= 2305 😂
What is the code for element
Tq!
Thank you
Can't get on English
Hurry up and get to the point 🙃☺️
Me funcionó súper bien. Muchas gracias.
Hooo
Thank you
Can you use this remote on a Xbox 360 slim
Thanks
Thank ya sir!
In 2025, using this, and it was successful.   Thank you.😊
I'm no good with written instructions so this video was super helpful! Thank you!!
The automatic code method worked like a charm I'm a little surprised it's an older sharp TV didn't know if this remote would connect to it or not but it did. Thank you! For the video!
Can I make the Fios Remote P265v5 into a total universal remote so it will control the TV Channels?
I'm in shock it's 2025 and I was given a tv for free without the remote and I just tried your method after 20 mins of a headache and got it in 5 mins thank you it worked
I'm having a hard time with a vizio tv.😢
i just want to let you know that this just worked for me within 10 minutes!! thanks life saver!!
Is this remote for Samsung only because it says universal remote but then after I bought it I get it home and in small writing it says preprogrammed for Samsung TV
Please help it doesn't work on my tv
For the auto-code search follow the steps but have your tv on and keep pressing the buttons he says until what’s supposed to happen happens. This process is done in about 5 min or less no more than 10 min definitely. Rewatch, you might be doing something wrong. Good luck!
Dude you're my hero...😅
Thank you 👍👍👍 very helpful
6171 for me
Thanks You for the help
Thank you so very much great tutorial easy to follow. Greatly appreciated.
How about a lg dvd
Thanks I need those instructions 😊
You’re amazing!!!!!! We have tried for hours to get our Bose surround sound to work! The code you used! Did it! Ty!!!!!!
thx man 😂❤❤❤
Thanks Rudy
I found the instruction page taped to the back side of the cardboard inside of the hard plastic packaging the remote came in.  Don't just cut a slit in the top of the packaging to slip the remote out.  You can't see the instruction page inside unless you pull the plastic packaging apart.
I hold set up and the red light doesn’t glow on my controller
Wow thank you very much for this video! Is there a way to sync when you hit the power button it turns off both the receiver and tv at the same time?
What dose it mean when I press set up and hit just starts blinking instead of glowing red
Oh good he put the invisible link for codes
Was a great help, thanks
all my buttons are mixed up
Thank you so much I'd been trying to program this new remote with no luck then I watched this video and programed TV and DVD ty ty
Worked great! Thank you!
Thanks for your help!!
Thanks
Thank you for doing this video. This is the easiest and simplest way thank you for doing the video. I was so frustrated listening to everybody else or the instructions with her GE remote.
I want see código tv LG
Worked! Thank you. 😊
Why does this guy look like a 70s porn star?!
Thank you! Worked perfectly after instructions on the internet did not work for me
thank you soooo much !!!
Thanks!
Shout out to this guy! The QR code on the remote sent me to a generic remote setup, but this guy has the exact one most of us get at Walmart 😂😂
Ugh thank you I went through all the codes and none of them worked, the auto code search section saved my life😅
Yooo was reading the paper like wtf saw the code took me a minute was done lol thank you 😊
7252
Thank You so much
I come back to this video everytime
Thank you for the video I just bought a new GE remote control for my old yamaha receiver and didn't have a code for the receiver so I looked it up on your code list here and it worked on the first try Thanks again , the code was 0446
Link to SHARP TV CODES????
It worked Thank You!
Thanks.
Thank you. I lost my DVD remote and was going crazy not being able to switch from one episode to another, no pausing etc. You're a life saver.
Great video.  I got the remote to work on my Dreamlink cable box, except for the volume.  Volume only works for TV.  The original remote had volume for cable separate.  Anybody have suggestions?  Thanks...
When i hold setup, the red light wont glow on the powerbutton- but it lights up when I touch any other button so I know its not broken. Does anyone know why or how i can fix it?
You're awesome dude..Thankyou so much this video really helped out a lot and it was easy as 123
THANK YOU SOOO MUCH I HAVE BEEN FIGHTING WUTH MY REMOTE FOR 30 MINUTES AND YOUR VIDEP HELPED ME WORK IT!!

Thank you! I spent an hour looking till I found your video...funny out of all those codes .. .the LAST one worked👍😂
Thank you sooo much
I travel for a living. Bring this remote to every hotel I stay at. I’ve probably watched this video at least 500 times and I still don’t have this memorized.   From the bottom of my heart…thank you.
Hi, any chance you could revisit this and take it beyond just coding? My old analog tv is connected to a Homeworx converter box with dvr feature. My remote is working in that it powers the tv on and off, works the volume control and mute buttons, lets me access the menu, and changes channels, but there is only one channel with anything but snow on it. I keep trying to add channels under the antenna in the menu, I've tried fine tune in the same place, I coded the remote to the tv - should I have coded it to the converter box? I remember something about keeping the tv tuned to channel 3 for the antenna to work, but that's the only channel that has a picture (a beautiful one, I might add :)) Also, once I scan for channels there doesn't seem to be any way to edit the channel list (not that I can see anything anyway, at the moment.) Should I add programming to the aux or maybe the dvr features? Do I need to try a new code for the tv that might work more fully? What am I doing wrong? Any help would be appreciated. Thank you.
I freaking love you 😂
Thank you so much. You saved the day!
Very help full
Hi am trying to find a code for my RCA remote but not working
Is there a code for Roku on this controller?
TCL Roku has 1 code, and it only controls the volume and power on/off.
Hey Rudy! It's evening on July 04, 2024!!!! Ok, I've this very same remote. It took all of just 30 seconds to program mine....my instructions were lost, & I don't see any link in the description below as you'd said you'd do because I just don't see any link. It's ok because I went to GE's remote website list, found the brand & the 3 possible codes. I did exactly as you showed & wala the 1st code worked. Thank You!!! It was super easy so I'm indebted to you. So, I'm a new subscriber, sent you a LIKE & now also a comment so I hope that helps you!!! Happy 4TH!!!
I’ve used this method so many times but I’m having trouble with it now. Usually when I hold setup light goes red when I press tv it blinks red and goes steady. Now the light goes away as soon as I press tv. Is there a way to reset the remote?

Can I add a Roku to this remote
THANK YOU!!! you helped me within then first minute, i was having trouble with which button to program my DVD/VCR player
THANK YOU! 💪🏼😈 Still works!
Hello, I configured the remote using auto code search and then used it for some time. After i switched off my tv using the remote, i couldn't use the remote to turn it back ON. I tried to find the code again but after hours of trial, i still cant. I've tried factory reset and followed both the direct code entry and auto ( which worked previously) but still nothing.The remote is not working; little frustrating as it worked fine for some time. I've a Sony Bravia smart tv. Appreciate any inputs from anyone
Thank you so much! I come back to this video every time I have an issue with my tv remote! So great! Thank you 😊
Easy as ABC, thanks love.
OMG!!! Thanks, it worked
Thanks man you saved a lot of time
JUST SHOWED OFF AT THE COMPANY BREAK ROOM 😏 -THANKS.
Thanks so much! This was so easy with your guidance 😊!!
So should the tv be turned off first before pressing setup and tv and then entering a code ?
Thanks you
Thank you sir. You have made my day. I have the same remote as you but lost my codes and thought I was stuck. Don't even have the receipt for it anymore. Threw it away but that last code thing saved me from buying another one. Thank you again.
Minuto 4:26 para manual

Really like your video, but even though I followed the instructions I still can't get my Samsung Blu Ray model# BD-JM57 programmed to work with this exact same GE Universal remote. None of the codes worked for me which is a real bummer! But I'm really glad so many other people had success tho!

How do I make my volume work
I can not thank you enough for this video. The batteries fell out of this particular remote that came with my tv and i could not figure out how to reprogram it. I tried every "code" i could find on every guide and none of them worked until i tried your "auto search method". I was seconds away from throwing the remote through the tv out of frustration. Thanks for saving me my money! God bless you!
LOVE it when there's no code sticker at all. ugh.

This was way easier to understand than the instructions that came with the package. Thank you!

Worked like a charm! - Many thanks from Toronto Canada :)
Thank you. Made it so easy.

How did he get the code

Your code is my code. So easy, thank you
thank you for this video, directions that come with the GE remote are not very helpful. Great video!
Thank you so much, I subscribed
Remote seems simple enough, but I am having one major problem.  If I use the remote for both TV and Cable box, if I select TV it only controls the TV, doesn't turn cable box channels.  If I select the Cable box it seems to do everything, except when I turn on or off the power it only controls the cable box power, not the TV.  Is there a way for power to control both?
Thank you so much! I was following the set up instructions in the guide that came with it, and I was literally getting frustrated with setting the remote up.

Auto Code Search Tutorial at 4:16 (:
What is the code for sharp aquos plese
Very helpful!!!! Totally got it
Thank you 🙏🏻
Wowwwwww! That Was Super Easy Thank You Sooo Much! 👍
I was going insane thank you for the automatic code finder
Hey, that's the exact same remote I have trouble with! Hey, that's the exact code I want to make! And... THAT'S IT? Looking at the instructions I never understood what they meant when entering the code. You're a lifesaver! Also, what's up with the dislikers?
Traducir al español
After trying the instructions it came with for 25 mins I found this YouTube video, read and after 5 mins the remote worked after trying the 2nd code. I appreciate you & glad it worked so quick 👏🏾
Okay dude how do you know the code for the sony tv
I have one remote that I always drop that I have to redo. Only one out of 5! The same ole one. Here I am back again. Thanks so much! I guess I should write it down, but heck I would forget where I put it.
This type of remote started fine, less than a week later, the remote only turns on the tv and controls the volume, I used to be able to go into the tv menu and control it through the remote, suddenly this feature is not working anymore.
Thank you so much
En espoñol
Lo puedotener en español
Thanks it works!!!
This helped—Thank you!

The instructions are stupid af compared to this video
Kevin Farrell -My URC remote seems to be on strike against my Samsung and Set Top Box- I have the right code but the implication is that I have the wrong tv and set-top box-message is keep the remote control and buy a new tv and set top box-bit expensive that- Technology stinks
Thank you to everyone who puts out the most random self help videos that always save the day.  Thanks bud. :)

I have a RCA tv were do I find my code?
RCA tv codes ?

Will this work on my Sony Blu Ray Player?
Me encanto!
What is the input button in the upper right corner for?
Is that an LC3 model or LC4? I have the LC3 and the auto code search doesn't behave this way. Your description is the same instructions I see everywhere else online for the 33709. I have two of these remotes, both LC3 because I need the button layout that one has, but for some reason I can't seem to find instructions for the auto code search feature that works on this revision. The way my remote behaves- it continuously searches through hundreds of codes with a 3 second gap between each attempt. Whenever the TV turns off (or on) when searching indicating it found a code, I have tried to stop the search by pressing the Vol Up button, or the TV button, or even the power button, but it doesn't save the configuration for the one that worked! And it doesn't seem to go through codes in any particular order, so I never know where I am in the list. This is quite frustrating. I'll just have to keep searching online. Sorry for the rant but this is ridiculous.
Thank you, this video help me to setup my control
Great video Saved me from all hastles
Is it possible to also have the power button on this remote work universally so that it turns on all of the devises at the same time or do you have to activate each device separately in order to power them on and off?
When I connect mine I am only able to use some buttons on my control. Most of them like channel changing dont work. Can you help? (I have the same model control )

my back light is not working
My GE remote CL3 once worked but somehow it lost the code to the DVD player.  Put fresh batteries in and tried your method.  Tried the dozens of codes for Panasonic.  Sometimes the light went out after inputting the code other times it stayed on or blinked once and stayed on.  Tried the search method.  After 5 minutes the DVD player would turn off but the light kept blinking.  Tried it again and when the DVD player switched off I pressed the Power button immediately to stop the blinking and pushed the DVD button to store but it did not store the code.  Did it again and pushed the power button when the DVD player turned off, nothing.  Did it again and pushed the Volume button and there was no saving of the code.  Any suggestions?
Thank you . With your   step by step instructions I was able to use my new remote.
Thank you sir! This helped so much!
WORKS EVERYTIME!!!!!!!!!  thank you sooooooo much
That helped SO much thank you!
Thank you so much! I got the remote to conect to my RCA tv. But my tv is a tv/dvd combo. Is there any way i can control the dvd part kf my tv with the same remote?

Thank You, after a while of having it programmed, I guess I pushed a different button or something happened that it lost the program and didn't have the manual anymore, clicked TV to see if that would work but it didn't. After watching Your video I was able to have it working again. Thanks man!

I am trying to program this remote to my Roku TV. Everything works except the numbers feature if I'm using my antenna  for local channels. The channel  up/down feature works but if I type in a specific channel number, it does not respond. Has anyone else encountered this?  Is there a fix?
Hi. Thanks for this great info. I programmed the Tivo, TV, and sound bar...but it won't work on my Apple TV for some reason. I tried both codes (1093, 1664) and neither work.

Code list 3: https://byjasco.com/support/ge-universal-remote-codes/cl3
i cant find the code for my lg tv can you please help me locate the rite code to connect the remote to my tv please
When doing the “auto” code-find, at 5:20 in the video, “It Responded” means that the TV will turn off again.  It does not mean that the volume will be activated—even though you are hitting the volume button. This response is for me to look at in the future when my batteries die again 😁.  Thanks for the video!
Dear God thank you!!! I JAVE AN older Seiki & I'm on my 3rd remote and I finally got it to work
Thank you so much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It actually worked !!!!!!!
None of the codes worked
yo thanks bruh
The Code List 4 is much different than the Code List 3 of the same remote.  One call tell the difference between the two remote by looking at the ENTER key....the ENTER key as as labeled ENTER is the CL4 version.  The CL3 version has a graphic like a computer RETURN key.  For me the difference is the code for a ROKUTV!  Which can be hard to find in any remote.  Thanks for the video!  Well done!
Thank you, this helped me connect my controller! You rock!
The instructions added 2 steps that are not necessary thank you very much
Thank youuuuuuuuuuuuu

Worked in the first few seconds of the video! Thank you!!! You're awesome! The manual makes me hate being an adult! LOL!!
I lost my paper with all the codes does anyone know the code to a TCL ROKU TV
thank u
I couldn't get the remote to work.  It worked right away after following your steps.  Thanks!!!
Thank you!!!
Thanks for this!
Master volume just helped me not blow my top, Samsung had a not available message that would pop up every time! Amazing video, thanks. Any codes for Xbox one X? The three on the code list we're no go.
Thank you for your video took me 5 minutes to set up the remote
Great job💪🏼
i am confusion ive tried alot of codes and it didnt work help
Thanks - good video, but not exactly what I was looking for. I bought this remote to use with my TCL Roku TV. (The cheap remote supplied with by TCL is pretty bad.) The GE is working OK for the basic functions, but I would like to program a button to instantly go to Netflix.  I thought maybe the answer was those ABCD buttons, but can't find any info on programming those. What is the secret to using the ABCD buttons?
You the best
This helped me so much thank you
Omg! I tried to program this remote for over an hour with the directions provided. You seriously just help me program the remote in 5 mins! Thank you so much!!

I had to use the Auto Code Search for my Vizio tv because all the Vizio codes in the list  only connected the remote to the blu ray player. Now the input button doesn't work for the tv. How can I fix this?
If the brand of my device (home audio system) has not been included in the code list yet, do you think I can still make it work?
cant turn on samsung tv
318k (old people) viewed this video

Your welcome.
Thanks. GE needs to refer all it's universal remote customers to you. GE remote instructions is so confusing.
Hello  I recently purchased a Swann PIR Key Motion alarm but does not come with a remote device which it should as they suggest to mount it aleast 7 ft high ,so in other words if it goes off you have to get a chair or latter to stand on to deactivate it using the keypad every time it goes off, I was wondering since this uses an infrared sensor is there any way to use a tv remote to access this device using its code source ?
Thank you so much u are the best

How come people dislike this? This is by far the best video I have found for this universal remote? Why all the haters
I tried every code online. I watch your video and it's exactly my code! Thanks, man.
Your directions are better than the manufacturer directions. Nice job.
I need help using my universal remote to work with my vizio TV...I am clueless
You just saved my sanity! NONE of the instructions worked! I can use all the controls except to open and close the DVD payer but none of the codes worked. The only thing I had to do after getting the code was to do the quick setup for the DVD player itself. Thank you!! It kept saying use enter in the remote but the up and down on the volumewad whatgot the right code programmed!
Thank You so much. I was losing hope until I watched this. Now I need to get my DVD Programmed and I'm clueless😫
I can turn my tv on and off using the search option but other then that and volume control nothing else is working like i cant access setting or change channels ect
How do i do a channel search
Tv turns on and off and volume works but channels don't change
Holy crap, thanks! Seriously, you very thorough and made it so easily understandable, thanks again.
What if your tv is not on the list
Thanks alot
When i hit the power button to search for the codes it only blinks 3 times. Help!!!
Thanks ^_^
