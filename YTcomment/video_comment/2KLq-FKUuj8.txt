lg motion great phone!
Can you make one on a sony cause can only beheard on the left ear😢
mine has 3 wires instead of 2, red,blue,white what do i do
How can I fix the wire?
Im like number 12000 💀
Yes me bro 😢😢😢
Thanks
You mentioned electric contact cleaner as a first resort. What, exactly, are we supposed to spray it on? All connections by taking the headphone cups apart? What about the wires in the head-band? Should we inspect/clean those?
My beats work on none at all
Hi Tampa is it possible to have the side that the wire was pulled working and then the other side that was not pulled not work, of the headphone that is.
Any one from 2024😂
Damn here from 10 years in future thanks a lot.This works even on modern wireless heaphones if one of the heaphones dont work.Well i gotta get whatever that tool was😭😭
I need to see how to repair the other side; the cable has come loose.  Not sure which of the wires to solder.
just fixed mine thank u❤🙏 ☺️
How do you pop that clip off? mine wont get off
Thank you❤
nice, solved !
idk if my cup is attachable or glued together. so im worried to take it off
Not worcking
Can this chip that has two wires be replaced?
Thanks 😊
my voulm butten is broken wat do i do?
Saved my life broke a expensive headphones and this fixed it 🙏❤
Thank you for this, really helped!
my left headphone only works at a certian angle😭😭edit: NOW BOTH MY HEADPHONE SPEAKERS ONLY WORK AT A CERTIAN ANGLE😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Thank you so much! I had this problem for 1 year and is forced to use my speaker for gaming, now i can game without disturbing other people!
Mines are a really special case, the microphone of my headphones only works in wireless mode, but when I connect it through cable it doesn't work (I also made sure it's not the cable).
What do I do if the copper looking part falls off (the one that I'm supposed to solder the wire to)
I dont have the weird heating thing. Is there other way to heat up the wire?
how do i take apart a skull candy plyr headset wireless with out breaking it ?
What if the cord connecting the left earphone where all the main components are to the right earphone is torn and has been spliced back together but still no sound in the right ear. I have taken the entire thing apart and everything else seems to be in order
Grazie mille!
What is the name of the headphone
This is great! It’d be excellent to see you working on newer models also
I have razer kraken tournament edition headphones and want to use them again because of they are comfortable and should the best. My other headphones is Phillip shp2500 they have volume rocker but they are not loud enough bass is ok. Cord is long for people in the music industry.
What does it mean brother if there is no broken wire but still doesn't produce sound, help please
that is exactly what happened to my over--the-ears headphones.  But I don't have one of those heat guns.  Can this type of repair be done without a heat tool?
' yeaa i have one good Philmore HD3030 Stereo Headphone with Built-In two Volume Controls... very good sound plus bass
thank youuuuuuuuu
I hear nothing but I have my volume up
That doesn't  look like a flathead screwdriver
Is the inside of the headphone the wire with cable
Only things: 1. I'd test the operation before reassembling, just in case.   2. I'd NOT super-glue the cover to the headphone base, in case of need for future repair.   I have a Cyber Acoustics headset, but it seems if I pull off the earphone cover it'll rip. I'm gonna be brave and hope they attach like yours, only tighter.
Loud Speak here
My headphones do not charge
I'm watching this because i sat on my headphones and it breaks oh God i hope i have an reverse time😔
My hedfons  can't work  ok i can't  hear  really well

mine doesn't  just pop off
After giving my left side a good slap it worked but my right side stopped...  Edit: I fixed my right side now my left is broken.....WTF
4:34 What happens if you overheat it? What if I might have overheated my headphones while repairing it? Can you tell me how to fix it? I've been trying to solder it to get it fixed but instead, I lost audio on both earphones. Any suggestions? It'd mean a lot to me! Thanks in advance!
I only hear background sound HOW??!!
Watching this because i broke my sister's headphone😃
What s I'm watching This Video After 5 Year

The connector is completely ruined to the point where the wire is exposed it isn’t completely sealed in and I tried taking the part of the headphones that go in your ear off and now they are literally impossible to get back on
I found this tutorial really helpful thanks

I did the same fix, but the sound is delayed !!! I don't know why
only right side works fine left pops in and out based on my head silvercrest headphones only 3 weeks old :/

I just fixed my headphones without no video or search it was easy I just used some sticky tape
thank you. this helped me
My headset stopped working like this but, all my wires are connected😔
How do I know what wires go to which part? My son ripped the wires out of both sides.
none of the sides work. when twist the jack it works as long as i keep it like that but i can't find a permanent way to fix it.

Thank you so much for making this video but I got a couple questions: 1- what to do if both wires were removed upon impact 2- what can I use instead of solding Thank you
Can you do this on the wireless pair
Pop that, pop that, pop that, pop that off.
Mines isn’t the wires or anything it’s that from one side I hear what I’m supossed to hear out of moving I think it’s completely ripped of I don’t know it’s a gaming headphone so I don’t know how to do it
Guys just give your headphones a good fix.Aka clean

I broke my headphones
Hiiiii what kind of wire did you use? Is that Cooper wire?
i couldnt hear anything since both of the ears on my headset doesnt work
my right side wont work
Do those come in pink?
welp i guess i can't fix my headphone i don't have those tools or soldering and stuff
It would have been better if you chosen to repair the right side from where the connection goes to left. More info we would have got as it is a dual connection side.
Nothing very usefull cause the broken part of my Headset is the  one where the wire goes in   and its different frm the left side
One ear squad😂😂
What if both of them are cutted off how am suppose to know the right place of each one
please do tell how to fix the wires without that soldering thing
I didnt use a opener thingy used my nails, Tried to loosen the headphones fixed the headphones  thanks :)
My thing with my headphones well i guess you can say earphone but not earphone problem, there's a wire hanging from the band that is making one of my earphones hang, BTW this is the logitech G432 headset.
how do i fix it when i broke both wires?
I can't on my headphones my headphones name is BT
Thanks Sir!! This was very helpful!!!
can i use anything Without welding machines to fix my headphones it's the same problem
for me is the connector what do i do now?
My headset wasn't working and then when I started watching your video suddenly the headset just started working...
Thx now my headphones won't work
I just bashed the plug against the wall which fixed it
Jjjd
I didnt have a loose wire. Plz help
listening to the steps. thats great and all but the only thing is i cant *H E A R*
I'm watching this right now with the left being normal and the right side with a sound too low. This is because I took a pee with it on my ears and it slid down my head when I looked down because I have a long hair and it's so smooth that it slids my headphone. Lol.
Who watch this video on 2020
Watching this using only the Right side of my headphones😞
Bru easy fix idk about that
Both wires broke and I don’t know which one connects where
THANK YOU, it's amazing. really works. from Brazil
Para os brasileiros aí: Gente, funciona mt, minha primeira experiência com esse ferro de solda e consegui consertar. Tem q ter paciência, não é tão fácil quanto parece, demorei uns 40 min. O estanho seca em 1 segundo então, é mt complicado fazer sem sugador. Eu me auxiliei com uma pinça em vez desse alicate. E a parte que ele passa o estanho no ferro de solda, é para "estanhar" a ponta. Ela tem que ficar toda prateada, antes de começar a soldar.
Only the right side works on all devices. I have to bend it so it works on both.
im really scared since these are my dads... and its not the first time i did it.. please someone tell me what i should do because im just a child and i would break it even more..
I was tinkering with my headphones and all of the sudden it worked. It worked when the headphones cord was untangled and straight. I guess that was the problem.
When I opened my headphones nothing was separated and the wires were still on the headphones what shlulsbi do
I open my Sony headphone(left), the wires are connected. Is it the plug?
My exact problem
Screw this, am just going to get new headphones because am not going to go through all of that just to have my headphones fixed.
My headphones weren't working, I was crying since I couldn't listen to my favourite song. So with a little throw, down on the ground, it started working!
Every video its the right broken like mine
very helpful, thanks
So i have the same problem: the right side doesn't work. So i followed your tutorial and opened it up. So when it was open i checked the cables but there wss nothing wrong as far as i can tell. But there wss and still is a small part of the cable thats flatened. The headphones still dont work properly
is it same for both sides
No soldier or wire! Any other hacks available??
The wires are on but still not working, what do I do?
wire is not broken .. but still no sound in right side
TRY THIS FIRST: PLAY BASS AND TREBLE SOUNDS ON FULL VOLUME. TRY TO SUDDENLY INCREASE AND DECREASE THE VOLUME WHILE SONG IS PLAYING.  IT WORKED FOR ME.  (NOTE: TURN ON THE BASS BOOST)
He the 1 speaker of my head phone the ware is broken how it  The second part pls how to fix what color the spl- green or gold
What if you don't have a loose wire?
Wat happens when its not the wire in the ear
Whats that gun thing called?
Instructions unclear my house is burning down
Can you do one with the Remax 520HB i cant open it
I dont have a solder...
First the right part of the headphone didn't work until i connected the cable in an especific position, now the left headphone died and the right headphone still works om specific positions :(
This is amazing , my headphones were not working and now it works
i just smashing my headphone but when i hear that tight and wire into device so it worked thanks man you are good!!!!!!!!
What’s the problem with my headphones cause the sound on my laptop is not working only the music can be heard
Lol I wanted those exact headphones fixed there the ones I use when mine are too loud , these ones can go lower :)
Nice ph0ne
Yo I did this and it actually worked wtf there’s no way I feel like I’m an electrical engineer
Mine works good but when i plug it in my ps3 then only one side works
I have tried it on different divides but still it doesn't work
Why did you glue it? What if it breaks again? lol
what is an mp4 player
My left ear enjoyed this video
But i have tree wires
Can you use hot glue instead of the gun thing
Haha! Nice prank bro, now im getting a new pair.
What if it's a Jlab BT Bluetooth headphones?

I just checked all of my wires and they all are in their correct places. What's wrong with it?!?!?!?!?
i cant do this so i ma get my uncle to do it good thing my dad and my uncle are good with stuff
My connector is rip but idk how to fix it
i dunno man i dunno how to open my headphones and the sound is only at right pls i need help!
Yours is the best video I have seen.  Good thing You mentioned screws as my HFI-350 did have screws. All of the wires were soldiered on green board ok ( DJ1-B   LG with small 4148*8 ) The left speaker with main wire works, but right speaker does not.
Yea my headset has none of these issues my cord is jacked from being bent the headset only had sound playing on one side when i got it and i had to bend the cord to hear out of both sides now i can only hear out of one side permanently or no sides at all sometimes. :p
my headphone is perfect as i tested it on my laptop but not working on my PC I mean only one sided
I guess this isn’t the same set that has a mic? I need mic assistance!!
Does superglue world?
My headphones fell to the ground and now I can hear it really quietly... :/((
My right one works but the left one  doesnt
Does this work on wireless headphones?
easy fix lol
NEVERMIND, WHILE I WAS WATCHING THIS VIDEO, I UNPLUGGED MY HEADPHONES WIRE, AND PLUG IT IN AGAIN, IT WORKED...JEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEZ
How to pop clips

Welp the trace brun ,any advice?
My left isn't working. I blew air at it.  It started to work.  Then my right stopped working.  I blew air too. It started to work.  Wow. Both of them!!!  After 1 min... Both of stopped working.
My wire are connected inside but doesn't wrk?
Cant put the headphone cover back like the small things broke while opening now wut to do? btw 2020
The number one mistake this video made was putting together the damaged earpiece (after soldering) w/o testing first to see if the soldered piece was successful or not. Pro technicians don't do that. Nice presentation tho...
You just save 2 of my microphones thanks
My cover doesn't come off
bruh what if you have the nail things ;_-
im going to cry
It's my fault my headphones dont't work
I just slap my headset that doesn't work on the other side     It work bruh :v
Have to go to the store again..i hv warranty lol
why god why.. both of  my headphones are like THIS AND THE VIDEO DIDNT HELP ME AT ALL WHAT DO I DO NOW
so I just checked the right part of my headset and it was all good so I have no idea where the problem is coming from.
Very smart. By super-glueing everything together you make sure the next repair will be infinitely harder. D'Oh.
My headphone only work in certain positions
thank you so much! now i know why its not working!
Kept falling asleep with my nice turtle beach headphones, ended up messing up the headphone speaker
Those glow in the dark
In this video i got what i was searching for

Cant you make an easier way without those tools that not everyone has... besides the flat head everyone should have a screwdriver
You saved my 50 dollar headphones
Can you help me please? My left side dosent work  but when I opened it the ... Vires vere perfectly fine?
Hello i wanted to try this on my Marshall Major II because my left side is quieter thank right. But when i openned my left side, every wire were still connected.. what can i do  ?
He purposely did THAT.. trying to trick PEOPLE
Video: its easy to fix Me: ok Video: get a soughter gun Me: Wtf?
I soldered the wires to their places but i still hear only one side
Right ears like heres
One of the ears of the headphone just broke off all of a sudden
Thanks for putting this out there! Got a couple of beats from my dad a couple of years ago and almost emidietley broke them! I'll show him this so we can maybe finally fix them!
I fixed my headphone. Thank you sir
Why is the right one always broken
is it ok if i use electricao tape?
I'm a kid and my parents won't do this so uh I'm mad
Mine justs cut
I can’t hear you right now,I’m wearing headphones
There's an L in the word solder.....listern kids, never file your soldering iron. Clean it with a wet sponge. You will ruin the tip filing it very quickly.
I can hear music with my headphones , but I cannot hear when someone is talking or singing or ...., but when I keep turning the cable , I can hear everything but it must be fixed on the same position and it's too tiring to try to fix it each time and keep holding it
who is reading captions because he hears nothing because of his headpjones that don't no longer work
Just need to charge it lmao
Thank you man much love...
Mind do I can not hear ya .,.
i have the same headphones
thank you! now I found out why my headsets wont work In my left side
I fixed mine by pushing it harder xD

wth the sound for both sides of my headphones started working as I was watching this
One time my headphones broke and the sound still worked but it was disorted
my problem is, all wires are fine but when I play bass boosted songs the left side just shuts off
Wouldn't it be logical to add subtitles to this video for the people who.... you know.... don't have their headphones working properly? You completely missed that huh?
Dude I need your assistance on fixing mine. What if you don't have a solder gun

My Computer- 100 volume My headphones- 100 volume What I hear- Whispers "I'll just turn my volume down and back up." Uses keyboard buttons- No change Cleans headphone jack- No change "I'll try turning my volume down and back up again." Uses the volume change thing on screen- Works

can you make a video for SMS headphones please??
im not sure how much watts i had on coz it doesnt say but i might have overheat it, if i did what do i do from then?
if your solder tip is dirty DO NOT USE A FILE! it will instanty ruin your iron tip! use copper wool or a sulfer free sponge.
Uhh my wires are ok what do I do?
“Easy fix” expects everyone to have a solder
H
can I use a lighter instead
Thank you for not giving me EARBUDS instead of HEADPHONES
Would you please make a video of you fixing p15 headphones? I got p15 headphones and the right side of it is detached. Please!

tysm, i was scared that my hyperx-es were broken but then i plugged it into my phone, it worked, then i plugged it back into my pc, and it worked, ty
my headphone is no sound no in RIGHT
Thanks bro
I have repaired headphones several times for people with shorted out headphone jack connectors or the whole cord and the best headphones yet are wireless no cords to break
This is why I say sometimes it's good to know something about electronics because you can fix your own stuff and not have to pay who knows how much money to have someone else do it.
THE MOMENT YOU STARTED TO USE THAT FILE I STOPPED WATCHIN
Bruh this video has no sound... I wonder why?
Bruh you have the same headphones as i have
2:25 the wire that he's touching is the one that is broken in my headphones

How do I fix my Bluetooth headphone with very low bass and has a buzz sound?
what happens if ur headphone power went in
It was only one ear at the time but now my headphones are broken :/ dislike what a waste of 80 bucks
If your soldering gun is dirty, don't file it! You should clean it with something wet, like a wet sponge or cloth.
My problem are tha poms are broken
Look not every one has a souldering iron at home
i can't hear anything because when i purchased my headphones i didn't notice that in the book it said Don't use it on stuff that is not computer or pc and i used it on tablet and it wouldn't work anymore
Thanks
I did the same i worked so i can hear at last, not the same good sound quality a little lower but still ok till i get new headphones
Your one side might be not working on your phone because you go to settings > general > accessibility and scroll down
Yeh just pull out something that we don’t have
I have that exact same headphones model but it's the other side that needs work. I need help though cause I don't know what's supposed to be soldered where on that ear to make sure the button on the wire still works. Aaaaa
the problem for me is where should you stick the loose wire? what spot?
I have those exact pair
You just saved me I got a pair of headphones for Christmas and I accidentally dropped the two days ago and one of them stopped working You're my saviour
-i can't hear you- reeEeeeEEEEEeEEE MY HEADPHONES ARE broken.

i can do it but i dont have that gun... T_T
lol i fix the issue by accendint
i cant hear this pls help
All the wires are firlmy connected still not working😭😭
I Have a possible solution (it worked for me) so if you are having problems with headphones and are on a mac (like me) then there's a possibility that you have it messed up in the settings. go to System Preferences, sound, and there should be a bar "Balance". if it's all the way to the right or the left, make sure it's set to the middle. Now your sound should be perfectly balanced :)

Thank you
do i put the cubic fossil on my left diaphix or invert the solution with cannabistic matter?
That's great if a wire isn't connected. What happens when they are connected, look perfectly fine and still no sound?
I ended up just breaking my headphones and throwing them against the wall XD
I don't know what's the issue of my headphones. There's no problem with the cable, ive opened up the broken side of the headphone just like what you did to your headphone. And see no lose wire connection. Can anyone help me fix mine? Sorry for my grammar I'm not good at English.
Yeah i took my headphones out of my bag and the left side of them was twisted too much, they easily popped back into place. This happened twice, on the second time the left speaker made no sound. I doubt t’s speaker damage, probably the wire, gonna try this when i get home
First 30 secs into the video and my prob is fixed😂
My headphones got echoey and low sound so now the vds background sound over does it        Yup great for hearing some subliminal messages xD
Who else came because of ps4 mic
Dude tf ppl probs watching cause headphones borken but u make video with voice
what if we taped the wire ?
I soldered my wires, because both of them came loose, and I could hear just fine, despite the blue wire on the other side of my Bluetooth headphones being loose. When I got home, the headphones magically broke again, despite all the wires being fine. Help?
Can u use tape?
I don't have a solder gun, any other recommendations?
the right side of my headset is not working but the cable you showed was gone is there still i have no idea what is wrong ;-;
Ànd what if I have torn the piece where you solder the wires? Can I somehow fix that?
How to that (pop that pop that)...  How to do it
I figured out it's a problem with the cord! Luckily my cord can unplug from the headphones themselves and I bought a new cord
My headphones work but the sound is usally very loud but now it's low and I can't hear my stuff loud what do I do for this?
What I need to do if the wire is not broke and my head phone speaker still does not working​?
My headphones aren’t like that tho so I can unscrew them they are the flexible ones
My headphones are the problem... With my phone did they'd broke up?
please send SL-BT11 wire connection diagram
Yeah because everyone owns a solder gun.
Does it work with ear pollution?

I have to buy micro-Phillips screwdriver because I have teesy-weensy screws holding on my speaker covers.  But I'm 99% sure it's a broken wire somewhere.

The Mdr Sony is impossible to dismantle it
I opened up my headphone, both the wires were connected at where they should be but still that side didn't work in any device. So I opened up the other working side to see what's the difference and accidentally I broke one of the wire in that side. Now my headphone doesn't works at all.

im watcinhg on broken headphones and hes probably talking
I fixed it by plugging them into my phone and the back in computer xD
Just to check before I solder it back together If I hold the off wire onto the existing solder with tweezers and play music should I be able to hear the music? It will it not work until it's soldered on? Don't want to stick them back on if that's not the issue :(
Tried this. Both the wires where attached just fine. Guess Razer equipment is designed to stop working in less than a year seeing how it's the third and last overpriced item I will ever buy from them. Normally the saying is "you get what you pay for" but with razer products its "you get crap for paying a lot."
I use tape :]
I'got that same set of headphones but in lime green!
I have cat ear headphones and my sister broke the left side!!!!!! ARG!

I've never thunk about how important headphones are until they don't work
Was gonna throw out my headset until I saw your video. Nice one, thanks for the repair tutorial 😊 great job 😉
bro How to open this type of   Headset (  boAt BassHeads 600 Wired Headset With Mic)and change speaker please tell me something..........
Thanks, this worked awesomely. I just had to take it apart, since I dropped my headphones and the audio thing inside it fell out of its slot, so the sound is loud on the left speaker and quiet on the right. I managed to fix it thanks to this. :D
;-; I Need My Headphones For Sound But It Broke So I Can't Hear
The left side of my headphone isn't working
I know this is an older video, but I just Had to comment. I panicked when after just a week of owning my Light-up Kitten Ears dj-style headphones, the sound went out cos I forgot I had them plugged in and YANKED as I stood up. I followed your instructions and Thankfully I didn't have to solder anything, the wire just needed a wiggle I guess. Anyhoo, Full sound restored! Thank You!! You snagged a Sub out of me!
Pls fix the other side of the headset (left)
My Is Similar And Blue LOL :D
ur headphones looks exactly like mine.. but mine is black.. :)
Thank you it worked!!!
I thought your video was very informative, but it didn't solve our problem.  The headphones  don't work on any device.  Other headphones work perfectly with my phone and laptop.    The plug clicks into the jack smoothly without any issues.  The connections to the plug and to the headphones seem in good condition.   I took each of the covers off.  I didn't see any loose wires and the wire is tied in a knot like you suggested to prevent it from being pulled.  Is there anything else to look for as to why they don't work?  Thanks
That's pretty cool! Gonna try it out tomorrow!!! Hopefully it's gonna fix my problem!!!
i cant open my clips😢😢😢😢😢😢😢 plz help me
Great vid and much appreciated! I'm gonna buy a solder iron for £10 and save a small fortune on buying replacements for my sennheiser and jvc headphones that have loose wires.
i can hear this youtube video with my sony headphones but can't hear any facebook nor movie videos
You can also glue the connector to your phone too

guys my headphones are just making weird sounds when I use then! help me!!!
So first you show a wrong way of cleaning a solder tip but i let that fly over my head , but then i seen your next helpful tip!  using super glue to stop the ear muffs from coming off lol .. They was made to come off easy to allow you to get to the clips behind them which you needed a flat head to free them haha..The saying we all know "If it isn't broke then don't fix it" .. You now have ear muffs that will be ruined the next time you need to open them . Just saying though :)

I'm new to the engineering community and I was wondering if anyone knew what the plugs where called that connect the two wires to eachother? I really need that instead of trying to balance a paperclip touching both sides....thank you!!!
All "fashion" headphones are terribly, cheaply made. They've become a clothing accesory just like shades or a cap, where you simply buy another piece when it wears out. I've seen this headphone design used by dozens of brands, and none of them last more than a year. I mean, 10$ a piece is OK-ish considering you get what you pay for, but some brands like Urbanears take it to the extreme, selling the same flawed design at a ridiculous $80. nope.jpeg
Omfg just use foil if
+tampatec what is the tool called
@tampatec what is the tool called
can you do this with glue or scotch ?

Hi tam, can you please help me? mine is really odd my headphone would work on the right side. It works most of the time 9/10 times..But sometimes when I move my head at a certain angles the right side would work... now this can stop it from the slightest movements. sometimes it works and most of the time never HELP!
my headphones are cheap and as fas as i am concerned are the same like yours in this video. My headphones work on the one side but not the side you shew us on this video. It is broken the other side with the cable and the flexes are not the same between two sides so i cant fix them because on the side that mine are broken are 3 flexes not 2(two are connected and the other, the puprle one is connected together and it doesnt buckle anywhere they are just buckled together). I though ok i could replace them but if i can fix them it would be nice
I watched this video, and by a miracle both of my sides started working again! NO WAY!

NEVER EVER USE ABRASIVES ON YOUR SOLDER TIP! i.e. A file or sandpaper should never be used on it! You will effectively destroy the tip.

My Skullcandy Agent vintage road headphones have got a problem after I dropped them. The right side doesn't work though the left side(this is were the wire connection is made BTW) works perfectly fine.  But if I hold the wire at the place close to the left headphone ( where it is connected) in a certain position, then it starts working again. I superglued the wire tightly to my headphone in that position , and this helped as a temporary fix for a Month.   Now the right earbud has completely stopped working  and doesn't work even if I try changing the position and apply pressure on the wire. :'( I did what u were instructing and removed the cushion on the right side and unscrewed it, and found that Both the super small thin wires are fixed in place(Properly soldered and secured).   So were do u think is the problem?? Even the 3.5mm jack is in prestine condition(otherwise why would 1 of the earbuds work?) I bought these headphones 3months ago, and bought them for 49.99$ (I really don't want 50$ headphones to become useless):'( These headphones are absolutely amazing and I highly recommend them , the bass is also very strong. I really wanna enjoy these wonderful headphones , but because I dropped them , one side isn't working anymore. pls Help me pls , and tell me abt what I can do abt this problem. Thanks in advance :)
May I ask, what could be the problem with my earphones, I can't hear the bass with them unless I mess around a bit with the tip of it, like sort of push it to 1 side of the headphone jack, like up, down, right, left, get the point? So like... all I can remember doing that I think might have caused this is, once I spilled like milk or water over the desk and my earphones were there, so they could have been soaked, can't remember, and once I remember I wanted to clean my earphones and so I got a lil stick and poked it a bit inside and u know, just moved it about and stuff (they're those type of earphones that u can change the ear tips) so like, I don't know what's wrong with them :/
ok so I am a kid this is my promblem I got my headphone today my mom and dad cannot know about this I have none of this heating stuff help.

Happened to me, repaired them and then when i played music they worked but not much, when i moved them they intrerrupted and work only one or both, but my BASS is not working anymore its fuzzing when i play songs with BASS, help pls!
I have an over-the-ear set of headphones. The main wire+insulation that connects to the plug has two copper wires and the two wires+insulation that connect to the headphones have 1 copper wire inside each. I'm just not sure which copper to connect to which. Of course the copper goes to copper but, since there are two, I don't know which one each goes to, or if it matters.
Sony headphones are made to break. Three in one year taught me that.

how can i fix razer kraken pros (1 bad headphone on one side) i cannot seem to take the earmuff part
I can't open my cover
THANKS
Thanks, removed the cover of my left headphone which wasn't playing sound, wires were intact, there was just a hair inside. Working again after getting rid of that.
I have the same headphone but it is color black and it is sony. but the structure is the 90% same with yours. my left side is stopped working after a while. I opened it like how you did in this video and no wire has been cut off. I tried plugging it to all our laptops and cellphones and the only problem is just the left side. Can you help me please? I did what you said here but again the wire is not broken. what else could be the problem?
When i opened my E-Blue conqueror, it has 3 tine screws that non of my screw driver was to fit, after 1 hr, i finally make it open, what i see is that there are tapes everywhere to tape the excessive wire to the inside of the headphone side, and the problem was found to be that sound wire got disconnected from the board, after heating it a little bit, my whole chip bursted into flame, and i have to throw it away, Made in China ****
my problem is my wire didnt cut no one cut how to fix it?help me!
Cool....thanks! Both wires off one side. No solder or gun, but duck taped the very ends down that had a bit of solder on them and its working great now.
this is good and all but my problem is the wire it cut in half, cat problems....
I need some help with my headphones. I had a bass booster app on my phone and used my headphones with it but now my bass doesn't work at all.
So neither of these solution was my problem. I checked on other devices, still the right ear didn't work, I pulled out the speaker, both the wires were connected. Idk what it is.
how about headphone jack how to fix it?
What can I do if its the cable slightly under the headset on your Logitech G35. I gently straighten or twist the cable about an inch under the headset, this puts sound back into the right piece momentarily at very precise points. I guess it's open up and find out, and likely be unable to fix, or ask your advice on the subject. Hope you or someone else has some help. Thanks :)
I adust my headphones to much I'm like up down no up wait know down
Holy Crap dude! You look like James Franco!
What else can you use the take the side of the headphone off besides a flat screw driver
I have a small query though, I have a problem and that happens to be one of the side not working and when top end that is connected with the ear cushion is moved then it tends to work. Is there any solution to this problem? and what could be the problem can you process it?
what do you do if the main chord is loose where it's attached to the headphone? I have to wiggle it around to get any sound to play and it only works on the left ear when i do that. I took off both covers and all the wires were connected to the speakers so i was thinking there was something wrong before it split into the two sides.
Thank u
Which wires go where?
hey man i have problem with my 2 wire headphone mic and headset im using both but now my not work properly i have opne all parts of my headphone but everything  proper both speaker wire fix but headphone jack not proper change jack
can u show how to do it in a earphone coz even i have the same prob
Nice  Video! I found this while trying to fix a similar problem on my Beyer dynamics, which are pricey. The left doesn't work, I know it's not the input, it's definitely not the jack, and when I move the left speaker around it gets signal rarely (or cuts out the right as well). Everything looks like it's connected solder wise aswell... There doesn't appear to be any break in the wires either... Any advice?

Hi. I have a headphone problem and I have been trying to find a way to fix it for a week now. The problem is that I can hear wind noises in the left side of the headphone every time I am in front or near a fan (or any wind source). I tried opening the headphone but I am not able to pin point the cause of the issue. I am using an Avantree Audition Wireless. I'm guessing that it has something to do with the mic but I could be wrong. Also, this issue occurs whether or not the headphone is off or on. I hope you can help me out. Thanks in advance.
DON'T GRIND YOUR SOLDER TIPS!!!! ;sl;kdnflksjdlfkjsldkfj!!!!!!!!!!!!
Can someone help me i have the sades sa-708 headsets and my brother dropped them and on of the wires broke and i dont know which one the wire goes to and only the side with the mic has no sound

hey my wires are fine but still one head phone is not working what to do??
I have the exact same phone and i love it
Where do i put the wire? On the silver thing?
You can also get flux at Lowes,Home Depot,even Chinamart sells it,and of course its in the plumbing department of all the stores I listed.
Never file down your soldering iron. Chrome the tip instead
Theres a + and - sign which color cable goes to which? like yours i have red and gold tiny cable.
Mine is damaged at the jack. There is a blue, red, green, copper, and a striped (red/copper) wire. Green is left audio, blue is right audio and those only work If the striped wire is connected. Any idea on what the striped, red and copper wire are?
Thanks very much  It worked for me  👍
Dude, you really helped me, thank you so much :D
Thanks buddy finally get the sound Happy
Anyone knows how to fix headsets. When people talk to me I cant here them but when I talk to them they can here me,what do I do? Please help me!
Can you do this without sautering?
What if I have a problem with the headset jack????
when i'm using my headset with laptop,one side does't work but when i use it with my cellphone it does'nt even support..while my cellphone and headset are of same set

What if the wires of the headphones is hidden????
My devices can't read the headphone.I think my usb is broken.Anyone know how to fix it?Sorry if I have bad english
Had anyone done this on siberia v2 yet?
Could you do a video for repairing the actual broken/frayed headphone wires? Seems to happen a lot on Sony V6/7506 cans. You know how there's that enamel you have to scrape off in order to get a good solder connect? There's also a nylon thread that gets in the way.
Hey then why don't my headstet work after that ?
I need to know what the headset to the color wires to the pc are called please tell me would mean alot
i have a problems with my earphones i changed the channels of the phones but the same earphone is not playing i solder them but still nothing, how can i fix it ?
your vidiot  didnt explain how such a durable reliable design could have any weak connections even with the abuses and horrifying 2 bit megacompressed oversampling it can be subject to(for example the 2 seconds of this your unmuted audio made my speakers only respond 0~ohm signal. thanks attemptattek.....     ps I am quite sure your file tinning has a cold joint due to dull oxidized acid and no preheat,drop that file in a hotflux bath for 12 hours at 250' F and a proper tinning; that atomic bond could compare to krusty eggs on grammas black iron skillet
kewl vid bro
***** Can i just use a lighter or something that heats up?

I have those 2 wires already glued but i still have this problem, i'm using razer kraken
On my headphones (which are the same as his/you) my sound is distorted and I opened them up and they had a extra wire what should I do?
My right side doesn't work. It worked just fine some hours ago (plugged in a TV), but now they don't. I tried to check if it worked on my phone and PC and it didn't. So... I don't know what to do, the... cable is a little ''loose'' in the upper part of the headphones, where it goes in. It creaks a little bit, but that's because I have been sleeping with music, something that was a bad idea... Another thing is that my headphones got a bit of static electricity from my carpet yesterday, I don't know if that could be something... But it worked after that so, I don't know. Got them for christmas 2013.
Where can i buy that kobalt pocket tool from?? I live in london

Hey, one of the speakers don't work, but the wires are both attached. What could be another reason and can I fix it?
nothing wrongs with wire but still cannot hear right ear
My headphones play the sounds really quiet and squeaky. But when I pull on the cord I hear sound so....
I was twisting the plug in my headphones now all I hear is distorted music and singing how do I fix it
what if the entire board the thing that you soldered the wire too came off how do I fix it?
Would probably be able to fix my headphones not BUT I have a Playstation Silver wired headset.......
My current issue is that my left earphone doesn't work, but if I find a sweet spot with it's cord, it'll work. Any suggestions?
Can you use tape
"It should just peel off." Shit, mine doesn't pull off. Welp I'm stumped.
I have a earpollution cs40's left side working right side not working WTF
Wait is this if u have to wiggle the signal piece cause that's my problem I'm havid or is it if it just shutrs off
was seriously about to rip my headphones apart.. started watching this video and dropped my keyboard on the cord. heard the ear that was broken cut in for a split second.  Thank god i didnt ruin my headphones it was the port haha just wiggled it a bit good to go.

Your video has no sound!

Tnx Man U really helped !!

The problem of my headphones is when i am listing  to music but i only hear the instrument
Hi, my headphones have this exact sane problem. I want to fix it but dont have a sauter joint , can a lighter be used?
what do I do if I don't wanna solder? Would some tape do the job?
Cool tutorial, but name missleads the real porpuse of your video, you just did a detailed video of how to fix plugins, not headphones.
Ya'll wanna single say pop that.
I have those exact same headphones. I think is the conector wire. How do I fixed it? is it fixable?
same i just wanna throw my headhone cuzwont hear the right headphone
i've had this problem for nearly a month, but today i found a way o fix it. Go down to the right hand corner and press the speaker icon. Once that opens click the speaker icon again (it should be on top), that should open speaker properties. Now go to levels and click balance, make sure both are set at 100%. Hope it works!
My Marleys are nnot able to be opened like that. IM SO MAD!
it did not work on my head phones its just broken more
what Do I do if I over heat the wire?
I did the same thing and when I opened the two mini cables where in there place, so I don't understand what's the problem....  HELP ! SOMEONE ???
Ugh! I broke three pairs so far and I haven't stepped on them or anything. Wtf.

My Logitech G230 Headset has been having problems recently. My right speaker has failed completely,but my left one is fine,I've had these for a couple months. Any help would be appreciated. Is there anyway to fix the cable problem without any special tools? (soldering iron,etc).

Thank you :)
My left headphone doesen't work i checked the inside of it but all the wires are conected...what to do?

What do u do if ur wire has a problem?
I have Auvio Foldable Headphones, my speakers are fine, although whenever I plug them in none of them work. I need these to work again, I'm dead if I don't.
I think i could learn from u
I have the same headset as you do but my friend in school accidentally pulled it too hard and sometimes the 'pause' button freaks out and opens up siri, and closes it and repeats and sometimes stops and fastforwards my music without me doing anything!

Please help me, I cant hear anything in my headphones. It used to play but then it started playing a little bit where I can only head like half of the sound. Then, I took off the thing where you adjust the temperature, I took it off and put it back in and now I cant hear anything. And also the cushion fell off and I dont know what to do. These are not my headphones and I need help fixing it.
oksy, so what if my headphone's wires are connected and fine, but its still does not make any sound on that side, what do I do now?
thank you very much
i have a pair of used gamcom head phones and the thing plunging it into my computer i messed up any easy way to fix this?
PLEASE HELP!!! One of my headphones isn't working and i looked and both the of the wires had come off. I don't have the hot pen thing so is there a compromise???
what is the brand/type or headphone that is?
what is that sound
its the right headphone that i took off
its the cord the conects the head set and the what ever it has a mic but if i put it in a wierd positon it works
this is quiet bad for me i have 23 pairs every single one is broke excpt one that i lost the wire but the problem is i cant hear the video
Hello, I have a pair of Sony headphones. I check the inside of the phones like you did because the left side didn't have any sound coming out. When I looked, the wires are both in place how they should be. I used the headphones in other devices as well and the sound is still not there. So is it in my best interest to just buy another pair?
I tried this with my beats solo hd but it feels like the problem is somewhere with the wire at the hinges on the headphone so i dont know hot to repair that
I already knew how to fix that but my problem is that my headphones are missing frequency or channels so the sound should be HQ but now its like these phone's with no bass and only plays .3gp vids please help
I did the opening opening part on right side of my headphones because it wasn't working and where the wires meet the part where you solder looks burnt. Anyway of fixing that?
Hey so how do I know if I burned the trace? I soldered the wires into the right places but I'm still getting absolutely no sound out of one side of the headset. I didn't even keep the soldering iron on as long as you did, maybe a couple seconds tops.
what type of headsets are they.
Can i get a free Sony headphone, mines broke and i threw it away before i thought of finding a tutorial on fixing it, lol.
I have skull candies and the left side doesn't work what should I do
I want to say thanks my works now I almost got new ones they been broke for about 100 days I had OK ones for back up but now I got my good ones back again so thanks for your help
Honestly if that happened to me I would just get new headsets...
Thanks mate! It worked perfectly! :)
My headphones weren't working on one side, so I tried this method. Everything was going well until I popped it open and realize that the wires were still attached to the things. So I guess there must be some other reason as to why they're not working :(
The plug in/connector part of my headphones won't work. Like i have to move the wire into a spot to make it work, but its irritating! Do you know how to fix it?? Sorry for the grammer 😅
4:28 by the way, I always was curious about that smoke, is it dangerous to inhail it ? sometimes I use fan to blow away that smoke, but sometimes I don't have a fan around, so is that smoke deadly ?
I have the same headphones as those but my sound sosen't work.I mean it works on the beats but the the person singing. I tried it on my mp3 and computer and i pod but it still does not work. ehat should i do?
Hey nice tutorial,i opened the left side of my headphones but it wasn't broken or anything like that then i opened the right side and it's the as the left side (left one stoped working).I've tried plug it in on my computer but it's the same the sound is only playing on the right side any help?
does it work with skullcandy
Hi, I'm having the same problem with the left ear of my headset, however when I opened it, the  wire was in place and there were no other loose wires. I noticed that when I move the wire (from the connector tot the headset) the sound works if I keep it in a certain spot. Any idea what it might be?
So i have a headphone with microphone, it got tugged on the left side. And in the left side it has the microphone wire. Will the steps be the same?
Can someone help me ? When I hear music or i can hear the beats (drums) guitar etc but when i hear someone singing, the singing sound are too low, but the beats works perfectly. Any one now how to fix it ? sorry for bad english :/
My headset are not working well its very low even the settings are All max out. How to fix this?
I tried an dumb screws wont budge ..i give up.
Thanks
Or would a 30w 3$ one work alright? I just don't want to brake my 400$ headphones even worse by using the wrong iron or temp.
Also I took them to a computer mechanic and he said his iron would just eat up the tiny wires? Was he right or just being lazy? Thanks again man
Alright, I could really use your help Tampatec. I have beats studios and the left speaker is blown, still works but it's blown. I was thinking about just swapping out the whole speaker and soldering it in but the iron I'm looking at is 200-450 degrees and I'm wondering what temp to use?? Any help would be highly appreciated as to will this work or not as this will be only my third soldering job? Thanks
a solder gun cost more than my headphones -_-
Thank's bro.....works perfect!!!
i dont have thise tools
hellow i have a problem with my ihip neon notes the problem is that i want to use the mic. and  headset at the same time (i don't really know where to plug it in microphone/speaker)(because it a single jack)

i have cosonic ct 735...head phone ...all of a sudden right headphone is off, i opened that part no wire is cut off and the other side everything is fine ...how to fix this problem?. my left ear headphone working fine and the volume nob.
Do I have to use that burner thing or can I use a real burner
I have that same kind of headphones. The problem with mine isn't that one headphone doesn't work. They both work, but I'm not getting the full sound. For example, if I'm listening to a song, I can't hear the singing. All I hear is music, and it's also kinda quiet. Do you know what's wrong?
tryed everything nothing fucking worked  shit vid
I have the problem indicated in the video. I checked the insides of my headphones and no joints were disconnected. The jack is fine and so is both my laptop and phone. Is there another reason I'm not getting any sound?
i have blutooth headphones when i play Music i  dont get nothing from the left headphone!!!!!!!!   plz help
But the wire was sitting on the right place... still not working. Any ideas?
Stop saying pop that
So idk how to do anything u just did but i have the same problem. I accidentally ripped the wire inside. so only one of them works now... any other way to fix them? lol
My Audio Technica ath-m50s recently started rattling a bit with heavy bass. I've had them for over a year now. Any suggestions?
hi, mine headphones do work....kind of. The sound on  mine is terrible the sound feels like if it was under water. and they dont want to output deep sound, High pitched sound works, but if there is a deep voice, it just gets automatically dampened. it is not the the laptop or phone because they work just fine with other headphones. Any ideas what it may be?
What kind of headphones are those?
thanks man
Hey! Can this method be used for my Creative Hitz MA2400 headphones?
i have static inone of my headphones, what could be the problem if all wires are connected please reply
Thank you bro!!! Helped me to repair my headphone!!!! :)
I opened mines like u did but all the wire's were connected
Do u have auvio headphones cause yours look like it
hi mate. i have a cooler master CM storm 400 Ceres and the speaker in the right side of the headset is broken. i just wanted to know if you know if the spongey ear bit is attached to the headset by clips, like shown in your video. cheers
Only one side of my headphones works and the other side just stopped
How would someone fix a more advanced headphone, such as a noise canceling battery requiring headphone, with the same issue (one side of the headphone not working)? My Soul By Ludacris SL300 headphones only have the right side functioning.
would this method fix headphones? the problem is that there beats solo HD and the left side has sound but little too no bass and the right side works perfectly.
What headphones are those
I would like to know how to repair a astropid A40 headset
good job!! looks great....although i personally wouldnt use super glue on the wire. I wouldn't want to make the place brittle to where it would break.
I need a lot of help my right doesn't work where as my left does any ideas
What if there are in ear earphones
I need help
nice video[iminent=OiRohcgUWfOB]
