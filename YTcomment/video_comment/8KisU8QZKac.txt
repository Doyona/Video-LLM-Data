Did you do something to finish the underside of the lid. So it looks finished when it's opened?
Y’all should do one of those cube shelf’s that they sell everywhere with the 9 cubbies. I’ve been wanting a new one but I’m redecorating and I can’t find one that fits the farmhouse style
Short girl problems? How tall are you guys? I didn't notice. 😅
Great job ladies!!! Thanks for sharing. As soon as you added the legs, i thought outdoor furniture. Yes i know i would need treated wood or some never wet and outdoor fabric or more rustoleum never wet.
My wife and I are looking to build something like this. Thanks for the vid!!
Can you please make a sturdy bunk bed video? I love all of your ideas and would love to see what you would do for a bunk bed 😁
I love it!!!!!! Girls, I need a DIY Couch project, please? I need to make 2 couches for my classroom!!!!
I know you lovely ladies have dogs. Have you ever built a "pretty" dog kennel for them? I've seen them on Pinterest where they double as a sofa table, an end table or even an entertainment stand under a wall mounted TV! I would LOOOOOOOVE to see you guys make one!
how about some neat nesting tables !!
Great video and project. I found that store rip-down is not really a good idea. They really don't care about the blade sharpness, lending to a lot of tear out on the pieces that require me to recut every piece they cut. This leads to more time on the project and loss of material. It seems the stores do not replace or sharpen their saw blades.
Love it! Wish you could’ve shown how you put the hinges.
Looove this
Did I miss the part where you show them nesting?
Fantastic idea and it looks amazing 😉 👍👍👍
Awesome job
Good idea . I would change this slightly rather than hinges I would put trim on the lid insides so they fit snug . With trim.going around all four edges you can trim the fabric ect flush giving a neater finish . That way you just lift the seat lid straight off and not having any fabric showing
Ears bahahaha, stealing that . From now on thats what Im calling them x
I love love love you girls.. I would love to come build a makeup vanity with you girls..
This video was much longer, and for a noob like me, it was much appreciated! Thank you so much for sharing! ❤️❤️❤️
Just what I'm looking for 👍🏻
Did you just attach the hinge through the fabric and batting to the wood?
Nice job ladies! I like the tin tile idea. I’m always inspired to do a project after watching you all.
Love the new graphics!
those are hella cute. very shanty.
Which Drill do y’all recommend? Love this :)
😍😍😍😍😍
