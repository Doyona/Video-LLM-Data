♍️📐🤘🕊️
“I’ll deal with that later.”  I felt that 😂
You're awesome! Thank you
I watched this several times thank you.
I did all that an it came out as perfect as it can but the touch up blending is waiting but not a problem. I'm thinking about glueing a 1/4" face plate on this yamaha I bought as you did on eBay 60$ new one it plays great I just want to give it a little added strength as it will match the black finger board and bridge but what will it do to the tone. Just wondering, I also have a Yamaha 200n silent with a black plastic pick guard and might just make it ebony.
I'm a newbie.  Have a small old Fender that has the key missing that you turn to tune the guitar. I'm not sure what to call that part. I was going to tune it using pliers but my sister said that will ruin it. I would appreciate any advice. I only play chords but love my guitar.
Wondering how to repair a tuning peg. Thanks
Bless this man.
Love how he doesn't over explaine things like most videos do.
I have an old acoustic that have a similar break and is kind in  the same condition as this one... Would love to see all the repair made to it.
Can i use favicol for same condition???
It’s not often you hear ‘cheap’ and ‘1930’s guitar’ in the same sentence
How can i repair a Taylor neck without having to buy a new neck? Also can i use a syringe to add glue to the cracks if i dont have a suction cup at the moment?
dont be a peghead and constantly drop your guitar or this sill happen.
I watch a lot of videos like this, but this guy is my favorite
Thanks Dan! This video gave me the confidence to repair a  headstock with a nasty "smile" break and salvage a perfectly good guitar.
[Insert Gibson joke here]
But why go through all that trouble for a $45 guitar?
I love watching his videos Ive learned a great deal from him..
Later? How to make caverns?
I'd love to meet Dan someday in person. On my Bucket list. 🎸🍻🐐
Tite bond instrument. I've used it, it's nicer glue! I have a wonder about how to replace guitar neck old to know neck on not bolt-on neck
When he said “I bought this guitar for teaching purposes” I thought this was a guitar playing channel, but then he started mentioning what was wrong with the guitar then I remembered what I came here to watch
Why not use original Titebond to glue back on?
Dan Erlewine is the definition of cool
Be nice to see it working
I am buying a 70s j50 and the headstock is broken off and isn’t with the guitar. Do you have any tips to build a new headstock and attach it
Fascinating, thanks for sharing your knowledge 👏
Those suction cups are messy - most cracks can be wedged open enough (even with the sharp edge of a Stanley blade) to slide a thin piece of plastic (cut from a plastic bottle or envelope) to feed/push plenty of glue in.
Watching this guy reminds me of I when I was a kid hanging out in my grandpa bob's shop (he called it dinking around, or fartin' around). I was always extremely fo d of him. Anyway, he would do little projects and explain them to me like I was just another guy in the shop. Fart jokes, couple dirty jokes ...you know...fun times. I wish I could hang out at stewmac. I miss Grandpa bob.
Is the neck gonna come off or is the body gonna come off of the neck? Looked like he was moving the body which would make it come off of the neck
What a cliff hanger.
Chop it off, make a new head and glue that on with a scarf joint.
Seriously? Toss it in the burn pile!
Lots of head stock repair videos out there but I have not seen anyone take the same amount of care and attention to details that Dan does. Saw one where a guy used PL premium from Home Depot. Couldn’t believe it.  Keep teaching us Dan. You are one of the best.  Thank you
Love this guy. So pragmatic in his approach. His secment Willy Nelson's Trigger was amazing. Spoke about it like it was a mortal being.
Dan should live forever
How about Luthier's ASMR
I would really like to see the finished item
You're in good hands with dan!
Dan love watching you work. You are a Master sir, a master. Thank you for sharing your knowledge, ingenuity, skill and enthusiasm. What a guy. God Bless you.
I would love to see a full repair on one of these bad boys
Dan the man can do anything
I had a Gibson mandolin headstock break. The repairman machined a rout on either side of the truss rod and installed two hard rock maple strips. He then refinished it and unless you held it just right in the light, you couldn't tell that it had ever been broken. And with the maple pieces, it'll never break again.
The headstock of my les Paul snapped off. It was ran over. Would hide glue be strong enough for tension for electric guitars??
The suction cup was genius. Definitely gonna steal that idea lol
I could watch this series hours and hours....👍😎
What is the name of the screwdriver handled wire brush?
LOL... I'm sure 99% of the likes are Les Paul owners.
Chub's hand.
incomplete!
This guy is amazing, it's like that scene from Toy Story 2 when Woody gets a repair lol
wait, so what happened??
Dan, how much love do you pour into those things to keep 'em live and going!?!?
Fantastic work. I love watching all your videos. Best wishes from Liverpool England.
And again the video on this channel does not show the end result
I hope we get to follow this little Charlie Brown guitar throughout Dan’s application of TLC!
as new
Hi Dan Why not use Tight Bond glue for the head stock repair Just wondering? Or CA glue for crack?
What is the name of the glue and where can i get it? Great video..
Living legend for sure Dan Erwin!  RIP to Rurle Yarborough Luthier from Alabama,  still learning from Dan.
What happened to this guitar, did it ever get fully repaired?
Man, I wish I could have kept watching the repair...
Dan is so goddamn good at what he does. I would trust him to do anything.
Dan,You make it look easy.Thanks.
Headstock broke off my '74 Les Paul Standard in 1977, when the guitar stand that was holding it tipped over.   I glued it back with Elmer's White Glue and it's still holding well today - 2018.  You can't feel the joint playing, but you can see it.
would just like to say  everything you do is spot on and a great teacher  i have been fixing and repairing guitars for 10 years now and i allways watch your channel for new ideas and different ways of doing things you are a living legend in the luthier industry !
Not cool; was expecting to see the missing wood filled with epoxie.  Also wanted to see him color match it.
How does this guy not have a million subscribers?  Awesome videos!!!
would be nice to see it all finished and playing at the end
His name is Dan? I thought it was Stewart lol
Great quality work Dan!
Would regular wood glue, like tight bond work to do a repair like this?
my guitar has a crack on the upper part of the neck and upon closer inspection, the wood itself is split. it is still held on by quite a bit of wood and the fretboard itself along with the truss rod. if you tighten the strings, you can clearly see the split. ive removed all the strings but I have no clue how to repair it. can you help?
Excellent video. Gave me confidence to finally glue the cheap but nice Yamaha acoustic that the head snapped off from. Thanks!
I have always used Titebond or thinned ( warmed) epoxy for this type of repair. Most lutheirs reject the notion of TItebond cold bottled hide glue. Why would you choose to use this over titebond or epoxy?
"plywood guitar" lol
Why use the hot water?
Wonder if a whole new block of wood and a scarf joint cut in the neck would be quicker?Ideas anyone
Can you use the suction cup method on titebond
More helpful hints that I didn't know or think of.  Thanks Dan, keep it up!
well i just did this repair so what i did a little different was after gluing the peg head i scraped and sanded both sideof the peg head then i traced the peg head out line on two pieces of beautiful blood wood over lays cut out the shape with a jewelrs saw guled and scaped them and fine600grit sanded them i fineshed it with a water  base shellac and fine sanded1500 grit and polished it looks great no ones the wiser
Nice Job!
why don't u just buy a new guitar for several hundreds of dollars instead of fixing it like this?
Last week we had a guitar sent in to the shop I work at with a very similar break to the one in this video.  It had clearly been repaired before and the glue joint had failed after it took a bad hit.  After doing a bit of research on the best adhesive to use for the repair (I considered regular Titebond, hot hide glue, epoxy) I noticed StewMac had uploaded this video, so I made up my mind to try the LHG.  I glued the headstock on Tuesday, left it clamped overnight and let it sit for 24 hours to cure before messing with it.  The glue joint was solid as a rock, and the guitar stays in tune and plays great now.  One thing I will say is that the LHG must cure under pressure because after 12 hours the excess glue from squeeze out was still kind of tacky but the headstock is solid.
Thank you Dan for sharing you incredible knowledge- Steve
I look forward to seeing a video history of everything you do to this one.   Great video, as always.  Thanks Dan!
Is the glued section really stronger than unbroken wood?
Dan  is the closest thing to a living legend that the luthier industry has.
The first thing I would have done is check to see how the two pieces fit together. I do that before removing any loose pieces.  Then I see what can be salvaged before removing the loose pieces and set them aside to be glued in either at the same time or later.  Maybe the chunk that was missing was long gone before Dan got to it but saving every little piece after a break can result in an invisible repair if the wood isn't too damaged.
Hmm. That almost made me want to break my axe so I could try these techniques!
I insist in saying that Dan = the Genius!
Interesting. I built a guitar about 20 years ago with Franklin LHG but I hear nothing but horror stories from luthiers and that we should never even consider using it. My guitar is still holding up just fine but since then I have used Fish glue for the long open time repairs. I think maybe the LHG gets a bad wrap because people don't look at the date on the bottle and more importantly don't test it!
