I would pay for that
Quick question, do you put body filler over the styrofoam.??
so smooth,👏
I absolutely love this kind of work. I worked on the Harry Potter world for universal and a few other projects for other theme parks. I love this channel and the video production is great too!
Aden, can you recommend a supplier for Polystyrene in or around Basildon?
very beautiful!
Did you happen to work on movie art departments? Or with people that worked on? How is sculptor servise supply and demand situation in UK? Do you get paid solid money in era of emerging 3D printig? Digits, if I may ask :) Warm greetings from Croatia
Amazing channel and subscribed a few months back. Your videos are really informational and at the same time entertaining! :)
