What of the electric goes out.
How do you pollinate the strawberry plants that are in the greenhouse?  Do honeybees fly in and take care of that for you or do you do it some other way?  Thank you
Great video. Thank you. What computer program do you use to monitor your greenhouse and the aquaponics?
Very nice, innovative setup! I would, however, take big fat goldie out of that "tiny" 50 gal, and put him out in one of your big drums. Plus give them some plants to enjoy. They are providing you with vegetation. May as well make their environment enjoyable. He has no room to swim or anything to really live for. It's fun to landscape tanks, and it's relaxing to look at, when they look pretty.
super dope setup love how he admits to being lazy and automates things
What program are you using for your statistics and to monitor the outside system?
❤❤Awesome
Keep up the great work!
"The drone shots of the farm are stunning! It feels like I’m right there with you. 🚜 [2:05]"
Solar panels for the heat part idea
Lettuce 😢
It would be cool to get some finches and frogs in there to keep the bugs off
wow 700 dollars was a whole different thing in 2011
700$ back then, 9000 now because of pvc prices lol

cool video, but you can keep the roots in the water all the time. It's important to enough oxygen in your system and then it should be no problem. I got so many plants with permanently submerged roots and they are all fine xD roots only rot in stagnant water and then a certain kind of bacteria causes it.
hello, what automation software are you using in your aquaponics room? does it have heating and cooling as well?
Prince William?
Ver impressive, must be costly in electricity
wow. you are so smart.
grown in fish poop is better than being grown with all that crammed up animals' manure from the factories those animals are stressed out and you consuming all that thats why im starting my own source of food right here at home
very nice, i only want things growing in my yard i can eat, except for the grass and trees, but after i set this up, the only non edible thing i will buy is hostas because they come back every year and attract deer, i love deer, like to eat them too ... eat my yard lol
Hooked on Aquaponics
I wonder how well you could optimize the space in one of these systems.
Have you thought about having ladybugs in your greenhouse to control pests? I'm building an aquaponics greenhouse myself and I'm debating on if I should introduce beneficial insects/pollinators to the greenhouse artificially ( buying a ladybug raising kit/leafcutter bee kit ).
Awesome man - great job ❤️
It’s time to glow real organic food 😊
i want that
Everything about this is great
Oh my God are usually drinking this Aquaponic water 🙆‍♂️
Is there a general rule of thumb for how much is required to raise a mature fish?
Whatever his job is, they are probably not paying him enough.
Augh the poor Computer! Just use a raspi for that which doesnt need active cooling! Even a pi zero would be enought for the job!
People constantly spread the myth that synthetic made fertilizers are made out of petroleum when they aren’t. That’s a lie that the media has spread. It’s made with machines that run off of petroleum. The fertilizer itself isn’t made out of petroleum.
This is what they should be teaching us in school
Sound reflective geometry can prevent weed and improve gravity growth asist posible rate gravity change may affect plant growth... thanks for your work very helpful
Wow loved that now I wouldn't drink to water but man I'll dig into the cucumbers in a heart beat lol
Brilliant. But please build a pond for your fish once they get big. Your beautiful girl in your house tank is not happy. She needs at least 350 gallons min to swim in xxxxx You can use the fish pond water for compost wetting or fertilizer in summer too....
All the work just for his peers to mock him with "did you grow those in your fish poop" lmao. If only they knew how badass this guy really is.
Looks like good Arduino project
what i don't get about this system is where do the plants (like tomatoes) get their potassium from once they enter the bloom period. isn't nitrate a plant feed for the grow period only?
how much electricity do all those pumps running 24/7 consume
Very creative 🇵🇸❤️🕊 Incredible work Respect and love from Jerusalem, the capital of 🇵🇸 Palestine
kids watching fishes. so cute
Granite is bad for health it's carcinogenic , don't use it.
Awesome system. Very smart guy.
Those cucumber and lettuce seedlings look weak.   I believe you need to get those fluorescent lights down closer, just inches above them.
Goldfish are edible.  But they taste like whatever they have been eating.  So feeding them tasty stuff would be the thing to do.  LOL
The way some of these people are keeping their aquaponic fish is terrible. Look at that nasty scummy container. No direct light, not enough room for the fish, no environment just a fucking plastic barrel jesus christ it's barely better than a factory farm.
Sulfur in fertilizer can be a byproduct of petroleum processing, but that's because sulfur is present as a contaminant. This sulfur is no different from mined sulfur, except where it came from. Any petroleum contamination would likely be less than what you smell at the gas station.  It's also worth noting that many plastics are petroleum based, and he seems to use several varieties.
I promise I mean this as a compliment.. you remind me of Toby from the office 😂
nice clever guy explaned it all very well glad i saw this =)
This man has basically designed a modern version of Flood irrigation.
damn its easy to forget how good decade old home footage can look
I would love to see the statistics within the greenhouse, more importantly the temperature on the interior/exterior. I would like something similar to this and am worried about the internal temp during the winter.
The main ingredients of making fish feed are rice bran (20-50% inclusion), maize (5-20% inclusion), soybean meal (10-30% inclusion), mustard oil cake (10-25% inclusion), fish meal (5-15% inclusion) and meat and bone meal (10-20% inclusion). Rice bran is mainly produced locally, and is derived from rice milling.
I am APPALLED at the conditions under which he keeps the indoor goldfish. Does this guy never think of how the animals are feeling ?!? The tank is way too small for such a big fish. There are no plants to enrich the environment, no rocks to hide, nothing to make their existence worthwhile. At least they are not in solitary confinement, as there are two of them, but other than that, it must be like a prison cell for these poor fish. Big thumbs down !!!! The goldfish in the greenhouse cannot be seen, so I can't say anything about that, I just noticed that he has a big amount of algae on everything, which is not healthy. There is a reason why normal aquarium owners regularly clean their aquariums. It's not only for the look of it, algae can be toxic.
Did you say you were growing weed? :O  wait, nvm :)
Am in Boston. Is this all year round in the cold sub degrees? I want to make one
The cute little kids were the best !
How do you pollinate the plants?
Is it only fish food and water in your aquaponics system?
Great system for wasabi, which does best in running water.
It is amazing to watch your system. Would you explain more on how you automated it? What is required to do so?
Dude Your not lazy!  I am lazy seriously 😳 After I captured my wife I really became lazy because now she does all the work, but she yells a lot trying to motivate me, but she know she belongs to me I put the chain and ball on her ankle so she can’t escape she like it because I am rich 🤑 it’s a nice setup because I just ignore the yelling.
*Guuuud...* 😊😊😊😊😊
Sorry rob, goldfish are edible.
I have a question about the crushed granite rocks used for soil. I know that in typical gardening, soil needs to be changed out when its nutrients are depleted. For the granite, does the fish wastewater continually fertilize it without the need to change anything out? I'm learning and would greatly appreciate any advice about these methods.
Awesome awesome awesome! This is so cool.
Dislike.
LOL I bought a cheap greenhouse. Two years later it flew apart in a windstorm in Colorado. I found most of the parts and out it back together. A year after that, another windstorm finished it off. Be wary, cheaper is not always better.
Trout don't do too well in aquaponics as they require fast moving water; perch do great like catfish and tilapia.
Done it. Works great. No issues. Period. Naysayers can shut the fuck up.
So simple and smart. He's clearly a very 'handy' person but this is something we could all do in our backyards like he mentioned. Thanks Kirsten and Rob.
Ammonia through their gills? lol
But wont the vegetables taste like fish?
Why would you rototill in your greenhouse?
Fishes are not food so keep the gold fish
I clicked on this thinking: "wow Kirsten Dunst really grew out of her shell" the name got me
Fish tank maintainence.
why dont you use fish that you can eat
Thanks for explaining,  very helpful educational discussions. Regards.
I have been looking into this for sooooo long.  I am settled that I am going to build one.  I just need to decide if I want to do indoors or outdoors.
What do you feed the fish?
Where is the fish?
4:07 plant looks like lizard top left
Love this video already and I’ve been wanting to do this for years now
I think that it cost more than $700.
The red lady bug will eat the afids .
Yeah bro...you never heard of aquaponics before...I glad that you created it. Tard!
As I’m watching this, I’m wondering if he’s ever shrunk his kids….
The Cost is much More. Lots of leaves, Where is the Food?
This guy is genius
Two questions: what's your yield like? Every time I see aquaponics systems, the plants look small and sparse. And I'm also wondering how much trouble you have from fish health (having struggled with fish tanks).
john malkovich really knows his gardening !
And you need beneficial bacteria to convert the nitrites into nitrates and then the nitrates are not toxic to  fish
Lol this guy still doesn't understand basic aquarium care, and the ammonia is from the pee and poo. It's the same as if you had a Aquarium with  live plants
He's growing weed. I guarantee it
That is awesome you're growing your own devil's lettuce. Puff puff pass.😤
Say you’re an engineer without saying you’re an engineer
Ncriz vand here.. nice vlog.. ur channel was highly recomended by edmonton tv.. dikitan na manong
Ironically at around 4:20 he starts a funny weed conversation.
Update 20 years later?  BTW.... Who wants to eat Mr. and Mrs. Goldfish for dinner??
Dude, untuck your t-shirt.  Homeboy is 100% in the IT dept at work.
very cool!
I had no idea fish excreted waste from their gills, this guy knows his shit
man, I love it
10 yrs ago
Do you add anything to the water ?
Can you do this without computers if you are more hands on?
That is an awesome system... And automated 😍.
Nice 👍
This is awesome, I just wish those fish had a little more stimulus in those tanks
Typical human ingenuity, too lazy to do something so uses a shit ton of brain power to create some software or whatever to do it automatically lol.
gill ammonia ?
When you find a new way to automate a farm in minecraft....
Garden of future
Wih Bwat nanem ganja asik nih🙊
I just tell people the poo is pre filtered through a canister to remove solid waste before going to the plants.
Awesome how it started from solving one problem after another until aquaponics solved it completely. The kids are entertained too!
Built KIT for home owners. Can provide Fresh vegetables and eatable fish.  Good for hobby as long as minimal maintenance.  🥰
I also want to learn this

Excellent Backyard aquaponics: DIY system to farm fish with vegetables
it might be fun to cut the pipe and insert filters along the way with a Berkey to finish. this is a neat way to keep water in the greenhouse.
How much electricity do you use monthly on these systems? Thank you
Yikes!  $700??.....
Amazing! How long it took to build this system?
The whole point of aquaponics is to get fish to eat while you grow vegetables !
Lol you cant get rid of spider mites by "smooshing" them lol Use neem oil ...all organic
The ad before this video is Tiny Green Monsters.  He says aquaponics is a "CULT" wth?
Зачем в данном случае нужна аквапоника, если вокруг полно хорошей земли, не требующей дополнительных вложений? :-)))
Hi your system looks gr8. Do you use any liquid fertilizer or any other agent in grow bed or in fish tank?
One thing led to another and now you have a mini forest lol
Is this the guy from Bigelow farms? 😅
the greatest success that I have ever had was by using the Keiths Ponics Site (just google it) without a doubt the best course that I have ever followed.
Hey everyone, the greatest results that I have ever had was by using the Keiths Ponics Site (just google it) definately the no.1 course that I have ever tried.
I have spent months studying aquaponics and discovered a fantastic website at Keiths Ponics Site (google it if you are interested)
Fish do carry tons of parasites so pr9bably best for anyone with weak immunity to avoid eating the plants near the water splash.
Lady bugs.... eat athids
Old video but lady bugs or praying mantis will take care of aphids. Just don't hatch an entire sack inside the greenhouse due to the volume that the egg sack will produce. Too many bug eaters you'll run out of bugs and they will start eating leaf.
Follow up please!
Do you have a video of the plunger build?
don't get me wrong this is one amazing greenhouse project but I am pretty sure the 700$ is total BS.
Nice work.
very nice system :) Thank you :)
What’s a good growing medium for paddy¿  Pretty cool setup there. True inspiration.
You eating fish poop!
Wow. You gonna make compost out this computer?
Very interesting and well done! What is he doing in winter though? Does he need to move the fish inside?
Kirsten, was this a video on home aquaponics, on it's face but, really an advertisement for Dell Laptop Computers? If not your intention, that is what I saw when he pulled out that dust/dirt encrusted Laptop......still ticking away! It's funny since Michael Dell recently bought about 50% I believe of the pump company called "Hayward". I am aware of this from designing in Austin (Dell has 10-15,000 employees there) pools, landscapes, and I design Organic Farms, Intentional Communities, Lakes, ponds, water gardens, etc. for many years. If he would have been running his system with Hayward Pumps I would have suggested you send this video to Mr. Dell, as potential advertisement material. Pumps & Computers! Great work you do, thanks.
This is very resourceful, but I feel sorry for the large fish who are so confined.
An aquaponic design without return of investment. What a waste.
Incredible, i really hope to set this type of thing up (although it seems very daunting!)
Man I love this. A little complicated for me though but I get the concept
While watching this I got an ad saying to stop watching aquaponics videos
That big fish in that tank is cruel. Do better.
I mean if you feed the fish crap food won't that food eventually trickle into the crops that are grown?
Well done!
This man is a genius.
I would like to learn more about the naturally occurring bacteria in the gravel.
Amazing video
what program do you use to monitor the all the functions?
E coli never became a problem until cows were put on  a diet of corn
I got dizzy when he said he can LOG IN to his green house. GEEK LEVEL 1000!!! I love it!!! How can I start my own?! 250 kuques in 1 year?!!! You sir, have won the internet!!!
i intended to build a green house and i have a koi pond and your video inspired me to take the plan a step or 3 higher. your automation proves its achievable.  gonna have to copy you.
great inspiring work. can't believe people are so stupid to not want to eat your produce .
Wow thats a big goldfish in the aquarium
Good survival system. Microscope and gas mask are good investments. My trees are sick.
To "farm Vegetables with fish".
Oh my stars IAM obsessed 😍 I want to have one soon..
It's very clean clean water  Camera straight away zoom into it hmmm 😆😆
Absolutely fantastic idea exactly what i was thinking of.. what is the ph level in the fish tank
Goldfish are edible but have a ton of bones they say.
Tumbleweed went bankrupt a few weeks ago. You should think about buying it. Maybe. Or at least parts of it...
Wow really good for growing pot!!!
Decent for 8 years old but if ur planning to do this now use Raspberry Pi, Ai & Monatomics.
fully automated DIY dont event belong in the same sentence
Dudes laptop fave me anxiety
Inside system doesn't look entirely sustainable as far as water quality goes. You'd have to change that out all the time and everyone knows we don't DIY to make things difficult haha I'd throw the goldfish in the outdoor system that's much more capable and replace the inside system with a larger number of more aesthetically pleasing aquarium fish. If you don't want to dumb money, just by 6 guppies and you'll have a whole school in a month. Personally, I'd go with a specific strain of show guppies and a neocardinia shrimp species because they are both comparable and breed like crazy so you can sell them online or to local fish store as another source of profit from the system.
I think you're a genius I hate your comfy clothes but I definitely think you're a genius I'm going to subscribe
Veggies need a wide range of micro-nutrients and biology, and I just don't see how fish poop supplies all of that.
your fishes need a garden aswell!  read: MORE SPACE
How does it do in the winter?   and do you have an idea of how much energy it uses?
What software do you use to monitor your greenhouse?
People who wouldn’t eat the food because of the fish poop are part of society’s problem.
8:09 “that’s what she said”
@9:46 "fish are cold blooded"   Really cool set up but but just FYI fish are not cold blooded.
It rubs the lotion on it's self...
@5:26 .…. omg that poor computer …...
Who here is getting ready for the new economy? Post corona?
You make me sick!  You’re using a living thing to help you automate your grow and you can give them the decency of light and feed by hand?  It takes a lot to upset me, but this video did it.  The least you could do is to make a ‘home’ for them.  You can see they’re stressed when you opened the container.  Respect life!
Hydroponic carrots. Really interested if he pulls it off or not. Awesome. I heard it doesn't work.
It's called compost
the poor fishes home looks like an under funded dull and boring af prison. there's no plants, stones or anything? this is literally animal cruelty. typical take-for-granted user asshole humans
This is not organic. Fish food comes with loads of chemicals. So naive. Cute but, check what fisheries are using in these pellets. So far from healthy. Stupid nerds.
you can sell fish back to fish stores after growing them even goldfish. it's not a ton of money but if you started from small goldfish and every six months or so bring them in and swap them.
see esp8266 for monitoring your garden
4:20, some greenhouses are full of weed.
8 yrs old video but cannot like this enough. One of the best videos out there because it demonstrates how software can be used with nature and a basic understanding of bio-chemistry can become an example of an Autonomous Scalable technology. Often technology and nature is pitted against each other which is un-neccessary. Additionally with the space larger Greenhouses take up one could combine with Aeroponics which is somewhat what he has done with the vertical tubes. For the aphids, companion planting or a Biol-101(once tested with fish) would deal with this.
Do you allow anyone to come and learn how to do all of this?
What do you do with the fish in the winter?
This system is based off of how a toilet works lol so when the fish shit and piss they are flushing also lol
Love it! Thanks for your aspiration!
Very informative video  I want talk to more send me your number.thanks
what happens if you clean the fish tank would you kill the plants nutrients?
are the containers 8:11 food grade plastic that you are using? or plastic that will leachate into the water?
This is so cool! =)
Really like the diy elements - it's clear he had a lot of fun designing the system. I would like to know how to replicate this but without using fish food which is totally unsustainable and often comes from factory ships that use slave labour. Effectively the fish food is the nutrient input, so how does one avoid that?
waaww. standing ovation for the automatic vent up there!
Nice work, I would love to start this on my farm when I get land. Manure and waste are natures food for worms and worms are known for processing soil and leaving nitrates in the soil. I bet these places with leafy greens and cow dung e coli outbreaks have no worms or not enough. Herd they are actually using fish compost instead should switch to this system you just shown. Using sea fish or non native fish for fish compost for inland farming is bad practice and would not naturally occur. A lot of people could benefit from this. I love this aquaponics system. Subscribed to the channel. Would love to raise fish.
my problem with the veggies especially cucumbers and tomatoes all taste like fish
Very cool set up, one thing i been thinking about is using actuator switch, motor and screen door rod to make automatic doors, windows, vents ect use solar or hardwire with timers. i am on small budget but i have solar power, solar electric fence and automatic solar chicken coop door. i also have solar stuff that no longer works so before i dismantle going swap batteries. if that does not work thinking about linking all the little panels together it may be enough to charge a 6 volt batery to 12. i love to fabricate, weld and do DIY projects. I want to build a large earth contact green house and use my pond and filter to catch fish waste. some for plants and i can use it in other garden spots. green house/aquapontics they need to sell/create a heater that is solar sure they have them. i figure small way use solar have 4 batteries use 2 while other two charge with large power inventor. utilize nature name of my game lol may sound crazy but invest to live better cheaper.
I have a friend who is growing bluegill in his aquaponics tank due to the temperature issue you're talking about. We're in Michigan. After stopping by his place and seeing his set up I'm researching to start my own.
Seriously...nerds fucking rule.
Aquaponics and hydroponics  Difference?
Where can I get the system?  Any instructions for DIY ?
How do you deal with pollination?  In an enclosed greenhouse and indoors in your house, you can't be using insect pollinators.  Also, how does that operate in Winter?
thank you
What computer program is that?
Good job, and also good advise for those who want to start with some idea of what they're going to need to do.
What manufacture is your greenhouse  please .
From Nebraska to Dubai then....Mars.Special kind of Man. "Apple of my eye"
love your videos!  thank you
I wish I was at good at computers and could set something like that up for myself but I'm definitely cannot do that
Facebook Group "Organic Aquaponics", all levels of hobbiest welcome!
This exact thing happened to me. 30 seconds in cept small scale and a rainbarrel goldfish situation which spiraled out of control.
See I cant bug bomb it because its attached to the house. I really like your green house.
So this will only work if there is electricity? Powering the pumps for fish to get oxygen and all. If power grid went out this would not work correct? Pretty cool setup nonetheless.😎
You need to introduce ladybugs for aphid control.
For heaven's sake put a piece of plastic over the laptop. How difficult is that??? Or a sheet of gauze to still allow airflow and cooling. What would be even better is mosquito netting.
The constant gardener..what state are u in?
"This IS my nice shirt.. what are you saying??"
I am impressed! Totally. My respect!
how much would a system like this cost to set up and running with the fish computer and all...and pay the person to help do that.
This is a prototype automated garden..but it is very very impressive sir..this is my first time seeing this..well done sir
Do all the nutrients come from the fish waste? Do you have to supplement anything? Potassium? Micro nutrients?
What type of petroleum-based nutrients? Cause petroleum-based products don't dissolve in water which is the only way plants can take up nutrients. Those bins and liners you use are absolutely petroleum based.
Thank you for the video.   I am learning to become a hydroponic farmer on Youtube and this is at the top of my video list.  Simple explanation and personality is top notch.
7:10 that's a fatass fish oml
poor fucking fish man. what a shit life.
9:07 Define "Organic" Are bug entrails considered *organic* these days?? I personally spray diluted apple cider vinegar on my plants. Are the bug guts required?!
Massive Gold Fish lol
Nice
Very intelligently done! I applaud you Sir!
Wow, this is VERY Impressive.  Your setup is something Im thinking of doing myself. Im very much looking forward to retiring and building something like this.   Brilliant set up.
Publishes data to the internet...? You're the man, going to sort through the comments I'm sure I wouldn't be the first to be interested in your setup. Great outdoor setup!
Very impressive!!!
It is a beautiful system there is no doubt. If the fish have no food value, it seems it would be more controllable and predictable if normal hydroponic nutrients were used.
Dude I was looking for a video like this one thanks
Seems kinda cruel to keep fish like that.
Thanks for explaining things
This guy has got some grade A chemophobia.
love it
what an absolute unit of a fish
That is the biggest goldfish i have ever seen!
So i love this, my only question is do you eat the goldfish?
Awesome project.  Although you could possibly use more aeriation in the water to help with the algae buildup ?
there's no filter in the setup anywhere?  because i imagine you'd eventually over-saturate the grow beds with fish poop and potentially burn the plants and hurt your fish with polluted water.
Call peta now! Those poor fucking fish
poor fish =(
Very Very Cool!
EXCELLENT !!
NEVER RUN YOUR SUBMERSIBLE PUMP ABOVE THE WATER NEVER!  other then that good stuff.
Very good good information.
It's all nice, but the fish prison part is not the most fun for the fish.
CAN YOU INTRODUCE A TYPE OF INSECT THAT will eat the aphids and not be a pest or damage the plants?
Thanks for the video I am extremely interested in starting to do this
I love the way you're explaining everything.
i guess you could use solar panels to heat up the water for the subtropic fishes
you can use a raspberry pi instead of a laptop. It is smaller and less energy usage
I enjoyed the way you're explaining everything.
Great job
Good idea, but I don’t see a major difference in just growing a regular garden. His greenhouse isn’t exactly growing better, it seems more of a hassle. It’s cool though.
Could you do this with a turtle? His water gets dirty ten minutes after I clean it & put a new filter. The filter can't keep up. I have 3 times the size filter you're supposed to have for the tank size 😫
what software you use in your automating greenhouse?
You're an I.T gardener😁 Right, where's the Cannabis?
I guess they could eat the “tilapia”....which thrive on eating “fish poop from other fish....They use tilapia to clean out polluted tanks.....
Would you prefer...if you had a perfect world...to have concrete or a natural pond in a bigger greenhouse...to increase your “grow beds”....
how much is your water bill each month?
It feeds the fish or it gets the hose again!
Animal torture.
Aquaponics would get a much better look, if the people doing it actually cared about the fish some(most dont it seems). Least this man isn't over populating the fish and for most part the water isn't murky from neglect. The algae actually helps his cycles, if everything is balanced.
Like earth, all goes around, not like human do destroy
I like your system. But the monster fish needs more room
Respect! You greatly inspired me... I'm digging a pond and try to plan a greenhouse. THANK YOU.
Goldfish are in fact edible.
Amazing how the spastic fish living inside the dark filthy barrel aren't all sickly & dead
Beautiful idea!
The biggest fish I saw last time was in the senate who played his cards well on money laundering thing. :))
The water bills must be through the roof!
What a soothing sound!
This guy is very VERY smart, I feel unmotivated already =D
Im not drinking that water. Lol
Should use a RPI ..
hello brother i have a question regarding the indoor setup. Instead of goldfish can i substitute tilapia so that I can raise and eat these tilapia?
What are the dimensions of your greenhouse?
This was very enlightening, thank you
he kinda looks like John Malkovich
i always think the small glassboxes are to small for fishes. the must all be depressed. but that dark bin in the growhose, not even letting the fish see the sky or anything ? :(  other than that - i think this is really cool, something for the future... as long as the fish is given bigger space, and more natural enviroment to play in
What program did you use to automate everything?
This is so cute. I love it
You can sustain your life with fish, vegetables, sunlight and waterpump
Can this be done in Minnesota weather?
A family member does this.  To me, it's too complicated.  I garden in dirt, lol but wish I was more technically inclined.  He grows beautiful plants & vegetables with his aquaponics as this gentleman does.  A bit envious but still love my dirt.
I really like your setup. I wanna build a greenhouse here in Texas but im affraid that it may be too hot here in the summer where temperatures reach 105 - 109 degrees with direct sunlight beating down 75% of the day.  But idk.
i dont like the idea to have fish in a dark tank! try you jump down there your self... buy a good akvarie and make a nice  natural environment for the fish so they dont live like slaves in a tank :D  make them happy ! so we all get happy ;) and nice little greenhouse i like, but wtf are you doing with a whale in a tank? can it turn around in there? my first though is torture and again make them happy ! :D  you have limited its freedom totally give them a natural environment and more space! then you will get thumbs up, and u dont deserve a thumbs down i think you are a good man :)
Watercress and try real wasabi both need to grow through aqua culture
What is his Chanel name?????? Can someone please please please tell me???????🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
The fish have feelings . You are not respecting that. Please change your setup 🌈
please give your fish some plants and tree roots, I feel bad for them. but nice concept :)
I do a fair amount of dwc hydroponics both indoor and out, but do have a question regarding the closed loop system of aquaponics.  When the bacteria breaks down the ammonia from the fish waste, you eventually get nitrogen.  What about the other macronutrients? Phosphorus, potassium, and micros like calcium and magnesium? Do you add those to the resovior or they come from some other source?   I assume the silicates are coming from the exploded rocks but how do you get the other stuff?
C'mon drink the water
This is a brilliant system, I am amazed how it works so well.
This in amazing and the way forward but could you give the goldfish indoors a bigger tank
Ammonia through their gills?
That was great
Tip: you should change your indoor fish to some L- catfish, they poop amazing amounts, even if they are small. And they don't need much light or plants, just be sure to check what they eat, some eat wood, some eat meat, and some algea.  Easy to keep and if they breed you can sell to others.
What a cute little aquaponics greenhouse!
Money is apparently not a factor
Watching is so nice. She cuts her questions and let them speak. Naturally. I love your videos Kirsten.
Have you ever considered using snails instead of fish? A big apple snail can generate a lot of waste, and would be more comfortable living in the spaces you are providing. If it was me I'd start breeding ornamental mystery snails and sell the extras to aquarium keepers while developing a nice line. Cool video and techniques!!
urgly
Where did you purchase your greenhouse
All you need is a robot to harvest and bring your veggies to the house.
I am so envious of this operation! If only I were this tech savvy. Also, these koi have a much safer and ethical life than people buying them for "feeders" for carnivorous species.
what is the name of the control system he used?
9:45 pretty sure cows aren't cold blooded...
Well, they don't excrete amonia though their gills, amonia is actually toxic to fish and can cause gill damage. Their poop and leftover food is what ends up breaking down and producing amonia.
it's called HYDRO ponics ...a bit silly when people try to create new names for things that already exist ... simply because they do not understand the meaning of the original
Damn, i need this.
awesome!
Cruel on the fish but I like the idea behind it
Could grow some good weed there
I was fortunate enough to have a really good conservation teacher in highschool. He let me and a team of my choosing, build an A frame. WOW what an experience! We had Talapia in tanks, the whole 9.   By the end of the year our aeroponics system was outperforming the flood and drain hydro guys. We had a few setbacks at the start, the misters wouldn't fire a few times over the weekend due to small leaks, the pump wasn't kicking on and we'd comeback to lettuce pasted to the side of the frame lol.   Once we got it down though... the growth was incredible! We had a fish fry and salad harvest at the end of the year. Good times!
Idk how i wound up watching this crap, but it was awesome. I want to make this a hobby
That is so cool! Good job with the video.
The garden system is beautiful. Why not treat your fish tank a little better lol, like so much design went into this, give em a nice home
what about the electricity to pump water constantly? it appears this system is inefficient and not self sustained.
He should go into business setting these up for other people.
Like like your set up!!!!
poor fish, no good!
wow
LOL Those same people at work don't know who poos in the lettuce fields where there food comes from.
this is my dream house. wowwwwww. and cool aqua project
My lettuce and carrots I grow in my garden and my kids love them but wont eat store veggies.
I have a 12×24 greenhouse with aquaponics system in progress but dude your lettuce and carrots are scrawny. But your greenhouse rocks.
4:30 not a weed, Portulaca oleracea (common purslane)
My favorite part is @10:24
What percent of your diet comes from this greenhouse?
Diatomaceous earth is fine for aeroponics, and will kill anything with an exoskeleton.
No good Life for  the fishies 😞
PLC?...…….
Add some snails and shrimp to that indoor tank and it might help clean that indoor tank a bit better. I’m not sure but I don’t think it would adversely affect your aquaponics.
thats a big gold fish in that aquarium damnnnnnn hahahahahahaha
If you were wanting to produce edible fish, you could just add a cheap aquarium/pond heater to fish's container. They don't take much electricity and if you needed to, I'm sure you could just add it to the software that's already controlling everything else. Or you could just eat goldfish.
It's funny that people would ask if it was grown in fish poop, meanwhile they eat hotdogs that are way nastier than fish poop vegetables..just sayin'.
💚
hey man get ladybugs for aphids
That' a lot of humidity inside the house, watch out for mold.
Youre screwed in an apocalypse scenario. Being with the plants, spending time pruning, watering, opening and closing vents and shade screens, and most of all, feeding the fish all by hand is one of the best things about growing food. Knowing by heart what the plants want and need to grow healthy food for you to eat is a mutual respect thing. If you neglect time in your garden, you will notice a difference in quality. That i guarantee you.
He completely lost me when he started to talk about nitrates and ammonia. Loved the video though.
I'd love to see you make some follow-up videos for folks like this that were interviewed more than a few years ago to see what changes they've made to their systems and any lessons they learned along the way.
i feel like that small tank with the two big fish is a bit too dirty and may poison them with ammonia eventually if not kept cleaner
Environment for the fish is horrible. They’re making this all possible the least he could do is give them a comfortable place to live
Dude you make Dexter look bad, great vid!
Thanks for the video! I have the same question as Chris W. Do you need to use a heat source in the winter?
I'd really like to know what he used to make his vertical strawberry planters, anyone know? Thanks xxx
Your fish are freaking out, they are not supposed to be in round tanks.
Question for you I live in Pennsylvania obviously New England gets extremely cold do you have to use an alternative heat Source in the winter time, if you do what is it thanks
this really inspired me to create my own fish pond self-sustainability is vital for the future of humanity.
this guy is totally adorable
What i thought the title was to farm Fish with vegetables?
Amazing hobbie gardenerds !!! Rad!
pfft, fukkin nerd. I'm jelly.
To prove it's benign effects on humans, a civilian contractor representing the chemical company providing the "Agent Orange" plant defoliant to the military downed a glass of it in front of a group of soldiers in Viet Nam.  This was long before the carcinogenic characteristics were known.  I've often wondered if that guy was still living all these years later.  The moral of the story; don't drink your fish water just to prove a point!
Some thing new to watch. Nice
this is awesome! starting my own aquaponics system inside my house!
this is fucking awesome , i know what im doin this summer lol ,
There's no such thing as a "lettuce factory".   And no farmer floods his fields with livestock manure.  It's all heavily regulated.
I really like using gutters for indoor growing they have a very low profile and fit write on the wall
Thanks full to share for me with this video, I hope could you please bring this idea to the school for all the kids can leanings how to lean and have more knowledge to live. I love this video so much thanks again
this is a good way to farm fish without harming the ecosystem
WOW there's so many goddamned fish enthusiasts....i hope you all care about your fellow man/woman...(and/or other catergories of people) just as much, if not MORE... ANYWAY...nice setup, dude.
Amazing outdoor greenhouse setup, I do recommend that Rob use a better light inside than those T-5's.  They are average for starting seeds, and veg, but will never get those plants to their full potential.  Plenty of cheap alternatives.
Awesome.
Really nice set up. You can use a fish tank heater to keep the reservoir warm. I had a problem with water temp so I put a small heating pad under it and it worked well for the plants I was growing. I also added a small fish tank air pump to add more oxygen in the reservoir.
I believe you can leave roots in water all the time if the water is oxygenated enough. The ebb and flow system you have: I like how it waits until the bed is full of water before draining. How important is that? I typically just flood it with a pump and timer and just have an overflow. I remove the check valve from the pump, and when it shuts off, the table drains back through the pump into the feed reservoir.
Looks like he heard the Sales pitch from the Foxfarm guys... The fertilizer is Petroleum based, lol Liars
That lettuce looks terrible.. Been destroyed by the aphids
Goldfish "carpe" are edible.... I don't know why Americans are so convinced otherwise... There is a whole Market in America based off of fisherman that catch carpe and sell for cheap to Asia to get eaten because they aren't weird.   They taste better than that Shitty Farmed Tilapia that you can buy at Walmart. FYI those Tilapia are often fed the waste of other fish.
Dude, you are a legend! Genius. I will follow your lead!
I'm astounded at the bashing in the comments.  You people are terrible.  Come on, show us your fish and your aquaponics system.  Small little cretins.
Warning you are using a hose and the nasty fish water is in contact with your greens the wrong way, in should be under the dirt or in hidroponic but NEVER touching your greens, look it up. Anything from bat flesh eating bacteria to cancerígenos quimicals specialy from gold fish water, even when comming in contact with your skin let along your innerts.
I'm kind of put off by all that garish white plastics. Nothing natural or nice esthetic to that. Makes me wonder how much chemicals peel off that into the food,especially when it's new. I don't want mad scientist. I also agree that's one poor home for goldfish..it looks like an unclean toilet. A few water plants wouldn't hurt.
Do u use UV light to kill bacteria
Awesomeness
What do you do in the winter though?  How do you keep your hoses from freezing?
Are goldfish eatable
get ladybugs for Pest Control... Check with the effects of neam oil in your water system it might kill your goldfish but it will really control pests from the inside out...
Hands down best system IV seen, and IV looked around
2:00 so can I pee on plants for them to grow faster??
Just wow
Fantastic
But how to pump the water up/ Youtube isn't explaining this secret.
Love it! Much respect from LA, California
nice set up you came up with,the only thing that i would suggest is consider using more black pipe in your set ups.you will have uv protection and keep your algae growth under control plus will all so increase temps too
how do you keep the pest on control, because i know tomatoes and cucumber easy to attrack aphid? and always having problem to control the aphid problem and of coures aside from green house set up consider it grown on open aquaponic system, because you have to minimize using chemical to keep the organic contamined or dead fish. thanks..
Or how did you make the siphon?
Do you leave the roots in the water all the time?
Really great video, very practical.
<l . ' ty.
Age of the Geek baby!  I really like this automated garden set up.
very good,bravo
THIS IS STEP 1 FOR SELF SUSTAINED LIFE OFF THE GRID. IF YOU HAVE PERCH OR TROUT, YOU CAN HAVE A PERPETUAL SUPPLY OF PROTEIN AND VEGETABLES. WELL DONE.
Does anyone can tell me if in US or Canada, it worths using electric energy to light the plants and make them grow during winter time?
I can across your video on Fast Track Grower - there's many great  videos there that may help you
i had no idea john malkovich was into aquaponics
John Malckovich's love child.  Awesome video. Thanks.
This is a great setup. I had not thought about carp (goldfish) as a poo provider in a colder climate. I would like to grow out tilapia too, but worry about the fact that where I live it is cold in the winter. The greenhouse makes it a bit warmer.
Is it possible to plant cabbages/cauliflowers in growbeds of pebbles?
interesting points ,if anyone else trying to find out aquaponics at home try Fast track grower (do a google search ) ? Ive heard some super things about it and my friend got amazing success with it.
the indoor one looks so easy
the nerd is awesome!
I love u dude, they way ure thinking and ur greenhouse is my dream!
I use to have a large 19'x10' Koi pond that I discovered aquaponic gardening with. I was really frustrated with all the filter systems I tried with this pond. Then I simply built an upper pond with a lot of my pond plants and a waterfall system to return the clean water to the main pond. All the fish waste fed the plants and the plants cleaned the water, and soon I was growing herbs and veggies in the upper pond and the waterfalls. I'm dying to get back to doing this...
Hello - nice setup, what software program and sensors do you use? Thx,
this is amazing!!! what a beautiful fusion of nature and tech. i hope i can do this one day. great vid 💫🌱💕
Nice..
Poor fish
You can eat gold fishes.  They used as food fish originally. You should not drink aquarium water, but there are no problem eat plants or cooked fish. Today you would use Raspberry Pi with Node Red connecting it to the intranet.
Poor fish :( why not adding some stones, plants and hiding spots for the fish?
What happens when it’s zero degrees outside.?
I love you Rob Torcellini
Hell yeah.
Cool😎
I think it would be great if you sold your own jarred pickles.  Picklefish
Thanks for the great video
Poor laptop.
Carrots in expanded shale?! OMG, WTF?!
Gold fish is edible. That's why they were bred
I like this set up!  A little more complicated than I'd personally want. The main idea is to be free from electricity unless you make your own.  But most of all this guy is cool.  He knows his stuff and pulled this off
You dont need to put chemicals down to prevent bugs, plant some nasturtiums and they are edible.
Excellent job!
this is epic. BUT if he wants "organic" and "chemical free" garden veggies... he shouldn't use PVC pipes everywhere. #3 plastic is NOT  adequate for human consumption / contact / etc.
Using charcoal filters and going though a filter a week?  In the aquarium hobby we call these carbon filters and they are mostly a scam. I have four tanks and none of them use carbon/charcoal at all. What you actually need in your filters is mechanical filter media (a sponge or filter wool) to capture particles in the water and biological media (ceramic rings, or bio balls etc, a big enough sponge will also work for biological) to host beneficial bacteria, which converts ammonia to nitrite and nitrite to nitrate, which is much less toxic to fish. This filter media can be cleaned and the sponge and biological media never needs replacing (filter wool will start to fall apart and need replacing after some months but is very cheep)  Carbon/charcoal is not mechanical or biological filtration, its chemical filtration, most people only use this after medicating their fish or if there is some other need to remove chemicals from the water. Fish shops love carbon filters because they need replacing every 2 weeks which means lots of money for them, this is also why lots of new fish tanks come with carbon filters instead of what they actually need.  In your case the gravel/grow media in your grow beds will act as more then enough biological media. You may still want some kind of mechanical filtration if you don't want your grow beds to clog up to quickly. The real benefit of the plants is that they eat the nitrate which will massively reduce how often you need to do water changes.
Would Diatomatious earth have any ill effects on the system, i use it outside for pest control as its natural and non chemical.
Very good job man! Quick question, you don't use any other than the fish waste to grow these vegetables? nothing? As i heard from friends that fish waste "only" won't be enough to give the plant all what it needs! Please answer me back, as i am about to change my green house to fully aquaponic system :)
Great information, thanks! I had no idea about this.
Hi Rob, great video Rob! why aren't you pumping  water directly from the fish tank to the plant bed?
About how many gold fish do you have?
Look up the inverse square law, get your lettuce plants closer to the light, 3-4 inches.
Thank you for your informative and clever video!
Dude! You need to build another garage style addition. Get a couple of those 275 gallon food grade totes and put your fish in there. Put your solar panels on the roof to power your pumps, lights and/ or fans for circulation.
I like that level control valve you made. Nice!
Those vertical grow towers are great, super use of space..:)
Great helpful video.
I would love to see this on a huge scale filled with trout
My grandma makes a hot pepper tea to kill the aphids just hot pepper flakes like you put on your Pizza in boiling water and a little bit of olive oil it kills them really fast she uses it by her tiny pond and it has never hurt her koy that started there life as feeder fish
nerd Garden or not smart as hell Kudos
Dose anyone know what this guys works as? Or if he just complete self taut this system? as he seems like he has some background in either engineering or science.
Urine is great for plants. People who are poop ignorant i don't bother sharing with. They just throw it out and go buy veggies they don't wash. Or pesticide filled "organic" farmers mkt.  I can any extra for a rainy day. Best greenhouse ive seen yet. I've subscribed. Ty
Is it possible that you plants cant break down the ammonia quick enough or get too much ammonia and makes your food a hazard?
slick automation. very nice
I feel this guy invented the latest aquaponics gardens sold in Amazon.
Fantastic! Thanks for the inspiration.
thats is gardening at a new level.
Steve Urkle would be Proud of your Garden!!!
A lot of people who get into Aquaponics are Fish enthusiasts. We get pretty sad when we see how poor the living conditions are. If you're looking to have a small setup to grow your plants, just take out the Fish, and set up an automatic dosing system with nutrients. It's ethical, small, and easy to set up.
Get some ladybugs for those aphids
Seams expensive to operate
gold fish are deliciouswith some of those miniature green tomatoes
Excellent
Nice strawberry towers.
Does anyone know if he farms year round?
Grow in dirt, taste the real difference and save a load of money not buying laptops, rocks, plastic pipes, plastic lining, plastic trays, Styrofoam and other unnatural chemical leaching stuff. buy hey if you plan to live on mars, go for it!
You're not a lazy Gardener LOL AWESOME SET-UP...
This is awesome!!
Are you john malcavich?
Amazing job!  What would you say is the ratio between the number of fish (gallons of water) and the number of grow beds needed to support them?
so lazy :) i love it.. thats a awesome job man..
What apps and tools would you use to automate the greenhouse? What system do you use to automate it?
Cover that laptop with a clear plastic bag or something, that will help. Computers get cranky with dust...
Fertilizers are made from petroleum products?
Same mil a frum old fish not frume baby's or adults when old that's whey you have to harvest the fish
Talapia possibly the most tasteless fish ever! the tofu fish
Much respect
This is a nice complex you have. I start off with a 7 site cloner from EBay sold by FastRoots.
Goldfish are mutant carp: therefore good eating! That large one looks good for salt baking, yum.
Great Video clip! Forgive me for chiming in, I would appreciate your opinion. Have you heard about - Patlarny Gardening Expert Principle (google it)? It is a great one of a kind guide for learning how to expand your produce with the clever art of aquaponics without the hard work. Ive heard some awesome things about it and my best friend Jordan after a lifetime of fighting got astronomical results with it.
Great set up!!! Love it! Thanks for sharing :)
What fertilizer for aquaponics
GIVE THOSE FISH A BETTER LIFE!!!  SELFISH HUMAN!!!  ANIMALS DESERVE THE BEST!!!  IT'S HUMANS THAT HURT AND KILL ALL LIFE!!!
cool to see John Malkovich has a hobby other than acting
Great idea thanks for sharing
that dude looks like john malkovich!!!  lmao
Very nice system. Where did you get or can you recommend the computer program you spoke of in the video.
would it be possible to spray the plants with peppermint oil to repel insects with out disturbing the fish?
Your automated system is it open source? I'm highly interested in this aspect of your system.
Perfect for someone to adapt a Raspberry Pi to run rather than a whole laptop.
this is just genius!
Will this work in a Michigan winter?
Which fish feed do you use? It's very important because not many people know it but most of them contain carcinogens. That's a major flaw in this type of setup. Plus the pipes and barrels need to be food grade. It's a must if you plan on consuming these. But then there is this argument whether commercial farmers even think about such stuff. They don't. But you should. You got a choice.
when people work on their own they can accomplish extraordinary ideas but it's when people begin to come together that wonders are truly within plausible grasp. good luck sir and thank you for promoting this miraculous concept
i really think this is so cool. i wish you had a youtube channel. i need to ask questions here and there. ignore all the negative people they are just that NEGATIVE.
get ladybugs for the aphids. be careful where you buy them. want them to be from the area where you live
I think for what he has he's doing a great job
Kristen What the system cost to run vs what it yields
Yo could you do this shit with weed
Beautiful house. hahaha
where did you learn all this. can you recommend some source?
This guy grows weed in there?
Pretty cool, but I think aeroponics is the future.
Care to share some information on those verticals strawberry piping? Looks interesting. I've never seen that before...
Hey this is pretty awesome but if it is your first video it would be overwhelming. Lets hope there is an easier one.
What do these things do to a person's electrical bill?
after 5 years. any updates to this?
Great video.
Brilliant video  - Have you done a Set up Instructional video please?
Beautiful!!!
Is your fish food organic?
bluegill and crappie (I say croppie) are great for aquaponics. never tried aquaponics, worth a shot though
What a great set up (and durable Laptop)! I love all the automation and would love to see some elaboration/schematics of the system. I also wondered what fish food do you use? Anything special, organic, etc.? (I apologize if it's answered in the comments below). Again, great work and use of space!
I was amazed by the automated green-house, then you revealed the bowling ball gold fish.  Anyway, will you share more on how you automated your green house?  You are not the only lazy gardener.
outstanding! thank you for sharing
Good ol' Cold Blooded Cows...
Do you think maybe keeping a bug zapper in there would help the bugs?
I think having your system automatically ran is genius! what program did you use with ur puter to do this? how did you get ur water to the strawberry plants and how is your bottle set up for draining? can you make a video showing this?
I'd like to know how to do this without the use of electricity.
oooooohhhhh my goodness, my jaw got stuck in the open position after I yelled WAOW!  fully automated, internet monitoring capabilities. This dude is smart.
That was great !!! Love his computer stuff. A over kill no doubt, but cool just the same. Can be at work and tweak it!! My only thing is gold fish??? Sure they LOOK cool but c'mon. Can't eat that. Pure urine/ammonia. There are cold water fish he could use.
How do you handle insects or caterpillar problem?
What is that exterior drain on the grow bed
Thanks for posting Very informative.
You have minimal amount of fish.  I would like to know, is there a general rule as to how many fishes should there be for particular number of plants?  Thank you.
I only eat fish as a meat product love Tuna, Shrimp love shrimp and I love fish tacos. Every other food I eat is vegetarian not a vegan. because I still need my Dairy.
What system are you using to record and monitor parameters?  Also, how does that drain weight that opens the growbed drain plug reset itself, does it drip out the bottom gradually?
5:50 how about cleaning that laptop a little bit?
gold fish are like many fresh water fish, and are edible....lady bugs control aphids...
Is it possible to get a hold of Rob and see the specifics of how he has his monitoring system set up?
The strawberry towers blew my mind haha
Where's your filtration system for the fish water? Most people use a swirl type filter, before it goes into your plants. This is interesting to see that you do not have one.
ty  Kirsten...appreciate it ! having knowledge of carpentry and spent years in gardening and farming ...... I lost track of advancements and my dire need to return to that life....these videos open my eyes..... I was at one time very self sufficent ,,,,,but I was outdated in comparison to some of your videos..lol..again TY
are you using arduino or something to monitor your greenhouse?
Despite some of the negative comments below regarding the treatment of fish in your system (and there were also some good suggestions instead of straight out bashing), this is an amazing way to grow vegetables. Imagine the possibilities and how systems like this will revolutionize farming and fill starving stomachs.
i dont think fish pee dude... like birds dont pee
There is nothing smart, ethical or good about stuffing a bunch of fish into  a small fish cage. Have ethics this guy doesn't even allow the fish to get any sun. Terrible design and a bad human.
pulverized granite is one of the best fertilizers in the world. only have to use it once every 7 years.
how smart are you? damn... lol
how does the fish poop get filtered/cleaned? does it all gets used in feeding the plants and theres no waste??
7:04 that poor gold fish with nothing to do; put something in there for him. elodea plants? a PVC pipe big enough for me to swim into?
no heath, the tank holds 2 fish, the length of the fish together should be the length of the tank, they won't grow bigger than it, and goldfish don't have to have as much circulation as other fish do, and Kirsten, about the aphids, you could consider getting some praying mantis, although I am not sure they would survive the winters...
you need to think more about the fish..... your conditions are not acceptable.  feed half as much and provide current...... if you can afford it, that big, extremely obese goldfish should have 2x the space, and a mechanical filtration that keeps the water cleaner.   you could have spent 1/4 the cost of your lazy-man automation to make the aquarium conditions humane.
Poor fish
Whats the monthly cost of water. Are you able to justify the cost in relation to how much food you grow, or are you paying for the experience in the end? Thank you. I am so interested in this recently. Great work man.
Look up Bigelow Brook Farm (Web4Deb). This guy, Rob Torcellini is awesome
love it
Cheers for the video content! Sorry for butting in, I would appreciate your thoughts. Have you heard the talk about - Patlarny Gardening Expert Principle (Sure I saw it on Google)? It is an awesome one off guide for learning how to expand your produce with the clever art of aquaponics minus the headache. Ive heard some incredible things about it and my good mate called Gray finally got astronomical success with it.
Well done system, Don. The only concern that I have is that you might have a double vapor barrier in the fish house. That could lead to rot problems. None the less, Aquaponics and hydroponics will become the norm in greenhouses and you have provided a shining example in that direction. Thanks for posting.
awesomeness
awesome
what software do you use the monitor your system(s)? Would like to incorporate that into my design that I'm working on. Thx.
oops didn't see the second one
that lone fish looks so sad and lonely :(
Does this work with cannabis? lolol
is there a way to make the environment more natural for the fish without compromising the system? Could you use a complete aquatic ecosystem instead of a barren tank?
maybe their is hope for mankind,????
I love you your a genius
How does he take care of the algae buildup?
Hello, pleas writhe a software or program information, how to get it?thank you
really neat stuff! we're starting with just some raised beds, but i'm getting more and more interested in doing a full closed system like that with Arduino controls! the raised beds will be the first test, controlling the water with moisture sensors.. anyway, i liked the video, thanks for posting.
use some biocontrol's to combat your aphids
Just a nice tip for your greenhouse :). In terms of pest control, you can actually release praying mantis or lady bugs which act as a completely natural and predatory pest controller! Praying Mantis can actually eat almost all size pests including aphids, spiders, flies, etc while lady bugs will eat aphids and larvae. Great bonus and both are bit harmful to us. In fact, praying mantis can even be pets, and lady bugs are of course nothing but friendly.
Absolutely educational and interesting!  Loved it...
Can this be organic if the water is living constantly in plastic? Doesn't that effect the crop?
interesting points ,if anyone else is searching for diy aquaponics system plans try Tarbetti Amazing Aquaponics Tutor ( search on google ) ? Ive heard some interesting things about it and my mate got cool results with it.
nitrates arent they bad to eat? curious, not talking shit. this actually looks cool but its on at 1:50 - 2:10 mins
I love this system.  I might just have to build one myself.  Something very relaxing about it
Great video. Great system. How much do you spend annually on fish food?
Aquaponics is a great growing system and it will probably be the city farming system of the future.
Excellent, what do you do in winter?
Que ermoso y bello bello
rocky mountain tilapia
interesting points ,if anyone else needs to find out about build your own small greenhouse plans try *Pyzork Greenhouse Plan Professor* (do a google search ) ? Ive heard some amazing things about it and my work buddy got excellent success with it.
NERD!! Just kidding I love this. I am totally inspired
your laptop look gorgeous ! :D
Feed the fish hemp seed...shelled of course...hemp seed is a super food...Google it
nice set up
Congratulations Rob, awesome setup, I am building one myself, first attempt for hobby purposes. I was impressed with the control system and automation you showed, it this something you could share with me as well? it would help me tremendously to keep an eye on things as I'm pretty busy at work as well.  Thanks!
I got lost around a minute....that looks like alot of work
Basil oil or the plaint its self is good for getting rid of bugs for plants but i don't know about it being good or bad for fish?
Put a red-hue light for your fish tank. The yellow will add to the coloring. All I can add. Since it's so sun intensive, thought about solar panels hooked to a batter tender to charge your system?
Good stuff; done well; can you share info on the first drain system you mentioned(plunger), Cheers
so damn cool. Aquaponics is amazing. Can't wait to have my own setup some day
yeah but what quality of life do the fish have?
Life is a circle Some of the original native American tribes operated these low impact self-sustaining agricultural systems using manmade islands and raised fish and vegetables together in this way. Europeans arrived and destroyed thei socities and cultures, replacing it with high octane lifestyles that are not sustainable.  But now people are going back to the native American ways, See life is a circle.
How often do you need to add additional water?
Thanks for the info. I live in the Pacific Northwest and want more info about the fish tanks. It looks like there isn't any rock or plant life in their tanks. Would that be a problem or is their a reason the tanks are left bare? Due to our climate it sounds like the Tilapia would need a tank warmer, something like a troff heater, just a thought. Would like to know where one could research this further.
I was thinking about setting up my own system out in cali. Its kinda dificult cause its really warm out here constantly and im not sure what fish i want to use that has alot of meat on its bones but does not mind a summers heat
wow thats impressive lol
very smart man
Well, pretty cool but I personally think that the fishes could have more space and some decoration. Wouldn't like to live in this tiny tank...
Since this has been taped, the Bigelow Brook Farmers have build a very impressive aquaponic system, last month I went to his yearly tour, I was impressed with his geodesic dome!  They're a great people........you should do an update on his aquaponics!
This is a great idea!What are the dimensions of your green house?
What a great system! Although he uses the word 'waste' incorrectly, if you can reuse something then it is not waste, it is nutrient, etc. Waste is something you get rid of because it has no further use whatsoever. It would be cool if he could grow some of the fish food as well!
holy shit that guppy/goldfish is huge, great video BTW guy.
awesome!!!
awesome gardening mate! thanx
Hi, please make another video tutorial about how did you automatized the vents, temp, with the computer, and what kind of software ? Please.
this is great, i'm putting up my green house next week, i'm really looking froward to it!... i'll be growing aquatic plants for peoples aquariums rather than food though
cool...
Fascinating.
Actually you can keep the roots submerged in water all the time. Deep water culture. As you would also highly oxygenate the water, likely beneficial to the fish.
How did He build His strawberry towers ?
amazing =]
This guy is soooo cool! Awesome video!
Inspired to make a greenhouse system now lol that lil gurl is adorable
I love this!   Simple and a closed food system.    I really would love to try it in my garden, growing fertilizer, protein and vegis in a closed loop system.
this is the best system i've ever seen. whoa.
2:13 shadow of a Lizard just chilling
I really liked this video ! Do you have a video that explains the electronic system of the green house?
I followed your example with the in house fish tank, and it went well. Remarkable growth, but I have noticed brown algae growing on the rocks and the plants are dying any Ideas how to stop it??
AWESOME!!!
Damned hippies and greenies are gonna love this, fucken idiots. Even if I admit it's pretty cool
It is impressive.  I'm curious about the automating part of it.  Did you write the software yourself, program arduinos, use some public domain software for regulating aquaponic systems?
It would be great to have a general estimate of what you have spent on the system after the $700 greenhouse. I understand this is a hobby that begets food. What I would be looking for is return.  How many pounds of food do you harvest annually in this space? If it is a "techie" hobby then I totally get it. If it is to garden for sustenance . .I just don't get it! LOL. I love it all however! Good work no matter the reason!
This was quite impressive. Good show.
This was quite impressive. Good show.
gold fish are edible
wow. I am impressed.  Good for you!  Thanks for sharing.
Real life farmville :). I like the idea!
U are awesome
I think This kinda stuff is so cool. Just wish the plants would thrive not just survive. Shared.
Why would there be 56 "thumbs down". when all he does was trying to be self sustain? I think this guy is amazing! I like to learn more, Does he has a web site?
In a system like this, how do you know how many fish you need per plant? What is the best way to determine how much waste you will produce and how much you will need?
Shared, really like this one
you should get a wireless connection for that computer... may stay alive longer... and see settings from inside the house.  Your lettuce may get a bit leggy with the light being so far away, those cool white growing bulbs can be 6-8 inches away.
Try Lady bugs for the Aphids.  They love them :)
Shared
how much would all this cost?
Technically, the plants aren't fed fish poo but specifically nitrates via the nitrification cycle of the fish waste: Ammonia(NH4)>nitrites(NO2)>nitrates(NO3).  In a new tank, it takes around 20-30 days for the bacteria colony (or faster using seeded media) to form that are responsible for the cycle.  I water my tomatoes with the same nitrate rich water from my 90 gallon aquarium during by-weekly water changes.  The tomatoes are organically grown in soil, which leads me to my question.   We're all set with nitrogen however, the thing I'm curious about is how the strictly aquaponic fed plants receive proper amounts of potassium and phosphates?  Only trace amounts of those elements found in recycled fish water, particularly potassium.
Ever consider decorating your fish tanks? Presently it looks like a fish gulag.
Excellent system! We will definitely be building one someday but we'll put a little bit more emphasis on farming the fish. I think trout will do quite well in a larger system.
what a great idea love it
You have built quite a nice little system. Having it fully automated is too cool.  I hope to do the same in the future. Thanks for sharing your hard work with like minded people.
Real neat and interesting video.....thanks for sharing.
The laptop. Has it ever stopped?
How can I find out more about the automated system he is using?
Backwoodsaqauponics week by week video
Dude, grab a cup of that water and use a micro scope... There's stuffs in there that will make you use a glove next time you touch that water !  But good video .
hold up.... through their gills? ... no its poop, it comes out the butt
DIY- My Ass.
You are  frikkin Genius, I love the way you are so laid back, and at the same time monitor your crop with little to no worry.  Please post more vids on how YOU built this empire with more detail???
@kirsten dirksen what are the moderate temperature for outdoor cultivation?
any one try using a raspberry pi to do the job of the computer. there low voltage and can run unix ubuntu? and cost 30 bucks.
Why can't you eat Goldfish ;)
A well designed backyard aquaponics is not only aesthetically pleasing, it also works efficiently and produces a great quantity with minimal cost.
Aquaphonics is a perfect combination for farming fish and growing your own vegetables. I firmly believe that these methods are both eco-friendly because it do not use anymore chemical fertilizers. I'm sure you will enjoy if you have this kind of aquaphonics greenhouse for the rest of your life!
I'm new to this but i would try more to be organized and have a better set up or get bigger
TROUT WOULD BE AMAZING thats like candy to me
Awesome!
you should not use any crushed stone that may contain limestone, can really mess up water pH
Very informative and useful... Thanks so much.
'Did you grow this cucumber in yucky fish poop?' No, I grew this one especially for you, it's made in the old fashioned way with a lot of chemical fertilizers and poisons. Enjoy!
excellent
Hey Brother,  Awesome job automating your system.  God Bless!
Awesome greenhouse - looks like a fun hobby!
Thanks for posting "Backyard aquaponics: DIY system to farm fish with vegetables". An excellent introduction on how to do have your own organic backyard aquaponics with fish greenhouse!  And, a plus was, this was made for colder weather climates. Very enjoyable video. :)
This Is A Great Video If You Want A Simple, Easy To Follow Aquaponics Guide To Build Your Own Aquaponics System Please Download The Guide For Free At ow.ly/qEtO3
please do a video on your vertical towers. do they accept net pots? your system looks very smart and productive. thanks
I'm curious as to whether he's using those finned heat register pipes, suspended from the ceiling, as collectors or radiators or both.....  Oh, and for aphids, there is no better solution that ladybugs, IMO, and since it's in a green house, most of them will likely stick around after you release them. I use them in my hoop houses with great success!
Amazing setup! I would consider setting the pump up with a 12volt bilge pump, some deep cell batteries and a couple solar panels. Set up another tank to grow duckweed to feed the fish and tada! Everything is free. 12v should even be able to power that laptop.  This guy is a genius. What a system! Thanks for sharing this.
Good point!
As opposed to eating veggies from the store, sold by the farmer who used cow, sheep and horse feces to fertilize. The sad truth is that some states even allow human waste to be used on crops. "Treated" waste from city sewer treatment plants is used to fertilize crops in some areas. Fish crap doesn't sound so bad now does it? And you don't even want to KNOW what chickens eat!
Put some praying mantis into that green house!
What happens in a power outage?  Would it be possible to make it operated by solar power permanently off grid?
The drawback to hydroponics is you will have to shop for "plant food" or nutrition and supplements which are high-priced. Aquaponics brings together the most effective parts of Hydroponics And Aquaculture therefore reduce price and also boost productivity help1.info/aquaponics-guide
Thx! I also do aquaponics. Checkout 99Aquaponics web on easy DIY aquaponics system.
What do u use to set ur planets in?
Wowww so complicated,,,,:///
What is the software and brand of equipment used to fully automate your greenhouse?
no answer yet sorry... :(
poor fish
Love it. Wish I could do the same. Very inspiring.
Good question....did you get an answer? If so, would you share it, please? ^:^
This is brilliant!
tilapia is illegal in california  the government doesnt want you growing your own cheap healthy food, they want to sell you their ddt infested shit
what software are you using in this green house to monitor the temps, levels etc..?  Nice work!
That's true but I'm sure he figured that out by now ,gotta start somewhere.
I love everything in this video, but I was a bit shocked by that artificial lighting. Why would you do that?
Holy smoke,what a great, system, Thank you Kirsten
so do you eat the fish? or they're purely for fertilizer?
Very interesting info! Kudos to you for what you've done! I'm wondering if there are any alternatives to fish pellets, which can have stuff that I would rather not eat (if the fish eat it, I eat it in the plants and the fish). Also, am curious if the fish are healthy enough so that you don't need antibiotics?
I've found that a fresh solution of garlic and water is a viable way to reduce the amount of aphids &  other insects.  It poses no harm to the fish as well.  It's just something you should try.  Taking a spray bottle &  lightly spraying the affected areas.  Let me know how this works for you.
You can buy fish emulsion fertilizer from any nursery.My step mother would always ask if I minded if she took some of my goldfish water for her flower beds.:-) It worked really well. Anyone who knows enough about it won't talk all that trash.Only those who do not look into the facts are so negative!
wow that fish is in too small of a tank
Sorry, Gold Fish are edible...ask any Asian person. They are in the carp family.
i amazed about how people put all this into a system... theory + practice...
Whats the point!. Using fish pellets means hes paying money to fertilise the plants!.
Carrots, in expanded shale.  Yeah right.  And those plants above the goldfish are light starved. You need a 4 foot 4 bulb t5 with 6500K lights.  Love the idea though.
eat veggies grown from fish fecis..... yuk!!!!
if you go to his youtube channel or facebook page he is really good with getting back to people. his channel is web4deb
Have you consider auto syphon/ bell syphon?
Great Ideas For Fish Farming and Growing Plants for the production of food, I believe It Can Be of  a Wonderful benefit to regions of the world That need sustainable and alternative methods of food production       thank  you
Big thanks for taking the time to make a video and help spread your insight on how to make a great aquaponics farm. Loved it :D
For your aphid problem you could use lady bugs which you can buy at most grow stores for that problem
wow 250 cucumbers from 2 plants, thats pretty amazing, if i could grow just 1 cucumber that would make my day, this greenhouse aquaponics thing looks very smart
Throw some compost red worms in your hydroponics!
Awesome set up! I sunscribed and look forward to seeing more from you.
Hi, Can you tel me how I can duplicate your automation system? Is it available for sale. Getting Lazy gardener.
Beautiful. Well done, Sir.
@AdamWoodhams this gardening technique uses fish poo to fertilize your garden and grow your food 4 times faster than conventional methods. Not only that, this new method of gardening doesn't use any soil what-so-ever which mean NO WEEDS! Wohoo! See this ==> easydiyaquaponicstv.blogspot.com
How about the solid waste produced by the fish?  How is that eliminated, or do you have to occasionally clean out the tank?    What about a power backup if the electricity fails?  Thank you for your video.  God bless you and yours.
Very nice video, Informative and clear communication and useful information all packed into ten minutes, thanks.
nice demo.
How sustainable is the drain flood system on your electric bill? Is there a way to use gravity?
For information on strawberry towers and other great ideas, check out Grow Food Not Lawns on Facebook.
.. why can't there be an edit button on here?  On the tank/bucket*
This... is pretty exciting stuff.  Pretty much fully automated!  But umm - do you need to maintain the algae levels?  The green surface on the take makes me wonder if this is as laid back as it seems
everything looks decent I can say that those carrots will not grow though :P
Hey Rob, can you please put a video up explaining how to make those strawberry towers? I'm interesting in making some for my garden. Thanks.
brilliant.  I wish I worked with you, I'd take your fish poo cucumbers any day.
Incredibly informative. <3
its a fake lizard
this guy is fucking brilliant he must have a super good life i want to be like him
thanks,
at 2:06 does anybody else see the shadow outline of a lizard or mouse on the cabbage leaf in the bottom right corner
I like this video.  Can I order the automated computer system?  I also need to know how I can order the aquaponics system with grow beds etc,
great vid dude!
Absolutely amazing an Inspiring :)
The greenhouse could incorporate some small solar panels which could trickle charge a battery rack and power that whole thing for almost/if not free depending on the size of the panels the Amp draw of that tank pump and servo motors for the window rails.. +1 on the ignorance of how "regular" food is produced.
I could duplicate something just like this for you. I have an Aquaponics garden, and am a Control Engineer for a living. Drop me a line and we could talk about it if you're truly interested. I have done a system similar to this for my own system at home.
aquapoonics looks cool. I wants some...
It never fails to amaze me how some people think. You come up with something as awesome as aquaponics and all you get is...But,but but doesnt that plastic leach into the water???  You mean it's got POOP in it???  Oh the electricity you are wasting. If people only knew how the food they buy and eat from the store was produced....JEEZE
Sounds like you have E. coli in the brain.
I'm hooked on phonics .... aqua phonics.
No Gophers!!! I love this.
Great video thanks for sharing!
Great video guys! Thanks for sharing all your hard work.
Thanks for the knowledge about E. coli.  Cause Knowing is Half the Battle!
Great video man I need the software you are using to automate the system
I love this hope  to get into aquaponics soon and WOA that goldfish is huge omg lol!!
the vertical strawberry setup absolutely blew my mind!!
Such a neat process.
Can your automated program be duplicated? Is your computer program for sale? I'm a lazier gardener than you.
Great idea good to learn something everyday. only thing I would add is a sand filter reed bed at the end to clean the water right up
Thank you for the great information on aquaponics. Interesting story about how you got started and then seeing the level you have taken it to is great.  Loved seeing the variety of produce you are growing.  Nice.
Were do you get that computer program that he is use ing
It would be a shame for you not to earn more  cash fast when these people do it  easily using Smarter Money Maker (search for it on google).
Do you allow bees to pollenate?
The production of this backyard aquaponics video is absolutely the finest on you tube.
BIGELOW
What software are you using ?
its not a gold fish , its KOI !!!! , They're way more cool than a gold fish
Wow thats awesome! thanks for sharing that. I would love to do that over here in Québec, montreal, but our winter are to strong :/
can u grow patatoes with aquaponics?
Thanks for another great video Kirsten, Great Job!
wow just saw the mother of all gold fish...
Nice system and I like the automation system you have going there.  Any chance of seeing a design plan for your control system?  I am building my second aquaponics system and it's going to be in a large green house, and I'm working a job thats going to have me out of town alot, I'd like to know how you have your's rigged up.  Looked very nice.
hi
'slave-made' under deplorable conditions in Cambodia? Those kind? The sweat shops in remote third world instances, that stitch Made in USA labels into the extremely expensive (North Face, for example) jackets and backpacks?  No logo - Union Made in USA, please.  You're totally missing the point. Hopefully you were using cynisism.
Very cool idea, but it doesn't look like you're feeding the fish very healthy food. Fish need a variety of food to be healthy.
This is one of the higher quality DIY Aquaponics System Videos. I'm Subscribing!
I really enjoyed this backyard aquaponics video. I love love DIY aquaponic videos. Thanks. I'm subscribing and recommending this channel.
LOL. Beautiful! A "grow geek" in every sense. ;)
unfortunately fish pellets, the primary input of this sysytem, contain fish oils and fish meal which are a direct product of commercial rape of our oceans ecosystem :(
normally you eat the fish. also hydroponics is extremely efficient
yes,, the soap works if you are gardening, but in an aquaponics sytem you will have dead fish , high phosphates and it will look like a human bubble bath! :)
"There's no outside chemicals introduced".... yet you use fish food you don't make yourself.... and from the look of it, you feed the cheapest, lowest quality stuff you could find (looks like a Wardley can inside).
dude,, your Comet in the 50 gallon tank is egg bound! LOL,, what do you feed her??
have you had success with using oil for ridding aphids?? what kind of oil do you use?
i wanna destroy ur plants, eat the fruit u have and devour ur fish
That was truly inspiring! Thanks for sharing. /mtm
Your supposed to use a fish you can eat like tilapia so you are growing fish to eat, they poop to feed the plants.  Plants eat the poop to clean the water so fish grow fast and no water changes are nessary thus saving water, while growing organic plants and fish to eat.
I don;t get it. buy pellets. feed pellets to fish. fish poop. use fish poop to fertilize plants...be easier to cut out the middle fish and use the external input to fertilise the plants direct?
thanks for a nice video. How much does it cost to set this up, with automated controllers and what is your ratio of harvesting ?
that is freakin sweet
You might try spraying a light oil on the leaves for the aphids.  It suffocates the aphids, but doesn't hurt the plants.  In this system you could probably put the oil on a mist system and perhaps it could spray the plants for you.
Aren't you concerned that toxins might leach from the plastic containers into your food or that chemical additives in the fish food might affect your food?
when/if the computer system goes out, try looking at a Raspberry Pi
where did you get the computer program to monitor everthing and send it to your email?
Thanks for all of these cool videos. Lot of inspiration that push me forward in this direction :)
loved this vid even the second time round haha
Aphids?  Use ladybugs!
"Rock Bark" is some sort of expanded rock used for landscaping. It is cheap, light, and very similar to what they use for hydroponics. Also a dark / black color on tanks and floor will get you a couple of degrees more temp.
Great video, very inspiring.
Awesome video!
How do you calculate how many fish to use in a aquaponic sysrem? I have an 8 X 8 green house and would like to set it up for a aquaponic system. Also where can I buy small talipia fish to use in the fish tank?.
Depends on the size of the system you decide to set up. Your pump should be powerful enough to recirculate all the water in your system at least once an hour. For most back yard systems, you could really run the entire thing off a single solar panel and some batteries. That way it would only cost you the initial setup. I've got a 400 gpm pump in mine that only draws something like 24 watts, and it's more pump than my tiny system needs.
Thank for posted
how much does it cost to run the pump?
Great video!! Just subbed
Is the fish food organic?
I just filmed the video. You can contact Rob from the video at his website Bigelow Brook Farm.. the address is in the info above.
kirstendirksen, can I talk to you guys about your aquaponics system, I am a Retired American living in the Philippines.
great grow house, good work man. giving me some idees, i am building a grow house this spring. now i will take the aquaponics system into concideration. and the strawberry growing in the pipes, great :)
beautiful. you are such an inspiration.
awesome video, thanks for sharing. good info.
Is it just me or does this guy look like Cyrus the Virus on Con Air?
This really cool. I love the idea and no waste.
please check out some proper grow lights for your indoor set up,you will see much better growth.
how do you run the pumps?
goldfish can get huge, they are from the carp family, i got a goldfish from the fair and the sucker got so big i had to put him in my pond, he grew to be about 8 inches long till i moved
Is it just me or does he kind of look like a young, bald, John Malkovich?
Will the fish eventually out grow the tank?
What is under the granite chips. I am assuming you are not using any dirt
nice set up, and holy god thats a fat fish :D
absolutely loved this video .... really good infomation from Rob Torcellini
Hydroponics yeild more and larger produce than soil does... at a faster rate. There are many types of hydroponics, aquaponics is just one of them. You also have Deep Water Culture, Aeroponics, Peeponics and a slough of other methods.  With Aquaponics, adding a solar panel and battery bank to keep the pumps going would minimize footprint even more. Wouldnt need much as those pumps dont use much electricity. And 5$ a month for fish food is not a worry when you think about the food you get from it.
food grade hydrogen peroxide at 1% spray will do some pest and fungus control and not harm the fish.   very nice greenhouse   I want to try an Indore vertical grow like you have but with blueberries they don't need much sun
Very nice.  My kind of (lazy) setup!
GREAT JOB!!!!!!
Its not about the space,its about biological cost for the food his family is eating;today everything depends on an aggressive industry system...if everyone had a simple system-a pot where they growing their own tomatoes,industries will go down and you can be sure of eating clean food without any chemical "punch" fertilizers. He uses a good idea of using fish poo... good for him, He replaces stones that never need to be replaced;soil does need replacement every three-five years.
Awesome! I'm building a greenhouse now and am motivated by your video and others like it!! Thanks for making it.
Just realized that this is not the original vid but if anyone cares, a small charcoal filter really pops that purple, also depends on the quality of your light because that light looked like it was an incandescent. There are some really awesome light spectrum for aquariums and I only figured that out after I started growing the aquatic plants.
I make a similar system to filter a 55gal tank. I siphon to a 10gal under my stand and pump it back. I put some cory cats and shrimp, plus some aquatic plants in my 10 gal. I can't put them up top because I have cichlids. My water is so clear it looks like its blue or purple. Try it and thank you so much for the detail on this vid. My next project.
awesome.  I wish i could do this.  Wow
you can use tilapia, trout, perch, catfish
i love this guy!
I live in Guilford, CT. I have a greenhouse. I wonder if Rob would be able to build a Aquqponic system for me, and how much it will cost? Thanks
Instead of having to buy fish food, and run electrics to pump water in order to just get nitrates and stuff from fish waste why not just buy the fertiliser? Could understand a bit more of the fish were edible. Dont understand the arguement about growing more in less space without the need for soil.Replacing soil with stones and water and pumps and tanks surely takes up more space
I've been looking at aqua vids for a few months and this is the best most concise most informative and SIMPLE explanation of design fundamentals Ive seen yet.  Why would anyone not want to try this after seeing this vid?  THANK YOU!
I love the indoor design with lettuce bed. I have been trying to think up a design for removing nitrates from my 55 gallon goldfish tank. With three fish 1 ft long each (one is a fantail if she weren't compact she would be 1ft), they are up to acceptable limit of nitrogen in 1 week. I feel dumping it is wasteful. Our houseplants do very well in the pic window of that room. A little bed of veg shouldn't get leggy. The soil-less approach is great idea to avoid insects. Thx 4 the vid!
yes! but he is using the fish to fertilize plants, you could do the same with tilapia in the tanks and eat them. Why waste good fertilized water that could grow a really nice garden. I too just use dirt and water but i like his ideas.
So much easier and less time consuming to just simply plant some seeds in the dirt in the backyard where plants grow to much larger sizes and greater productivity. The whole point in aquaponics is to grow edible fish not  some goldfish.
Can you tell or show how you made the strawberry planters? Thanks!
You might be right. As my experience with anything, what the books say and what is possible in practice can be two different things. Also, there are different strains of tilapia. I have mossambica and keep my breeding trio in the house because I never wanted to chance losing them over winter. I might try it next year, though. Sure would rather them be outside. ;)
I'm in CT. I see my goldfish swimming around under an inch+ of ice. But one of the places with tilapia I'm thinking of is also in CT. They have a fully solar-powered setup, so I'd be surprised if they were using heaters in the water, but I could be wrong. The post fairly detailed videos on youtube and I never heard it mentioned.
Tilapia won't survive northern winters without a heater... but you can add a heater to the water and they should do fine. They are hardy, but cold temps, goldfish do better. ;) I keep both, but use the goldfish for the outside (and I'm in TN)
When that cup fills up in order to raise the plunger to drain, how does the cup drain out so it can fill up again?
very interesting
Just curious, I see all the plants growing however theres no food production on any of the plants? Whats the cause of that?
Not sure on the talapia comment. I spoke to people who use them in aquaponics and praise their hardiness in all conditions.
Great Video!!!   thanks for posting it!
Love this idea! Thanks for sharing.
an artificial swamp wow who knew lol
Very cool indeed!
great tutorial and thanks. could you give more info or direction on how you are monitoring everything with your "filthy computer"?
Awesome Video!
seinfeld string bass... love it.  nice project.
This is so impressive!
This is so impressive!
Very impressive and inspiring...
It really impressed me that you automated everything! It's really inspiring how you stumbled upon Aquaponics, and really ran with it! It's so cool that you made a unique system that works for you. I know I'll have a greenhouse system after I leave college, and I'll use yours as an example to work towards!
Im impressed at how "high tech" you made your greenhouse, also inspired
ammonia producer for sure!
Excellent set up Rob.. Just curious as I am also in Connecticut how much of a "season" are getting in the greenhouse ? Are you growing year round ?
What about sprinkling with diatomacous earth for pest control.
Why not.  They certainly do eat your produce.  I have hundreds of black widows under my liner.  Every once in a while I remove the bulk of them because I do so many tours, but really you would never know they are there.  But they sure do eat a lot.
this is ace............ im inspired
YOU ARE THE FUCKING MAN!!!! great job. very informative. thank you for posting, seriously. I really appreciate it.
VERY awesome, VERY cool!! I have to look around some more, but did you write your own software to control everything in your greenhouse, or did you buy the software?  I want. :)
bad ass! nice set up sir.
Should I leave them there?
Check out Rob's other stuff on his channel.  web4deb he has some of the best self help videos out there.
no, plants mostly need N-P-K, nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium.  Additionally they need micro nutrients.  In this system k comes from the pH buffer, and P comes from mineralized fish poo
why do you want to get rid of predators?
How many months does he get a year as a growing season inside the greenhouse?
I have a problem on my system I keep getting spiders on all my plants and I have no Idea how to get rid of them all!! what can I do?
Great vid
that is an amazing setup!
Does nitrates provide all fertilizer and minerals needed for any plants like tomatoes, herbs, peppers, chili.  etc.?
Aphids? Introduce ladybugs to your greenhouse.
That’s very cool. Nice video. ☠
the big goldfish is awesome too!
A+++  Great video.   I love how you can log in at work and oversee your operations.   Some day I'll get there.  Best of luck and enjoy the veggies.
Wow man! Great setup! Fully automated! What kind of program do you use?? Good Work!!!
I ordered ladybugs online to take care of the aphids in my greenhouse.  If you haven't tried it, you should.  Works great with no chemicals and they continually breed.
try mosquito fish (minnows)
Your personal home goldfish is MASSIVE!!!....what kind of goldfish is that???
Excellent work for todays world SAVE THE  PLANET!!!
grow carrots in sand .look into it .happy gardening
I guess I would only wonder about the food grade quality of the storage tub used in the house. My guess is those tubs are made in china for storage of non food items and of dubious materials. A closed system would possibly leach out undesirables and the vegis would take them up. Just a thought.
dued i am thinking about building one of those that is great
LOL
Some Gardner walked into that little door on the 7 1/2 floor
hehe
Interesting concept, thank you. I have a DIY Garden Pond video on my channel.
Turtles and fish would work if they were an appropriate fish that the turtles wouldn't have a temptation, or at least capability, to eat: you couldn't have goldfish or normal pond/aquarium fish. Turtles would need their own maintenance but the amount of ammonia they would make would be astronomical and require a separate tank with porous rock or a commercial bio-ball system to grow nitrifying bacteria in. You couldn't have a snapping turtle, and the fish would be larger fish like talapia.
has any tryed turtle and fish
exactly what I was thinking while watching this!!
Nice!
NO. you would need a stupid amount of solar panels to power enough lights to grow fruits or vegs. you could blot out the sun trying to ..... wait why wouldnt you just use teh friggen sun? you trying to grow pot or soemthing??
I would likw to ask if this system can grow any type of plant or there are only some plants can be grown around here? This would indeed be wonderful, making an aquaponics system with edible fish and with plants which is hooked to a solar panel... why don't we think of technology like this more... this is amazingly simple and it is amazingly efficient and also amazingly useful, i am in awe
i swear to god this guy is related to john malcovich...
Use lady bugs for bug problems! They work awesome!
Beautiful!
except for the fish food, but he could grow algae and duckweed
Amazing video, gives me more ideas for my setup. I'm definitely wanting to run some edible fish, and I'll be near Denver, CO
Great automatic monitoring
Hey.. thanks for sharing, nice video...
How could someone dislike this video? For shame to you 18 (i.e., 18 was the number of dislikes for this post)!
I use a brush and a dust pan to get off the bugs and feed then to my goldfish.
Hello Rob.  I love how you have automated everything!  Would you provide more information on how you have automated everything?  For example, is there a specific software you purchased to run the environmentals in the greenhouse?
no - they use a lot of sludge - look it up.  Any wonder why so many ecoli outbreaks...
You could grow duckweed, algae and mosquito larvae to feed to the fishies.
I think this is brilliant!  He & other hydoponic backyard growers may be the future of food growing for our families.
It sounded funny. That is why I pointed it out.
The point he was making was obvious though. He could've avoided the *assumed contrary but whatever. He meant e-coli comes from warm blooded cows.
A lot of people start composting the solid fish waste with some of the dead foliage that plants lose while they're growing, and feed the worms to the fish. There's also a few crops you can grow that will feed the fish too.
Except you have to feed the fish.
you know solar panels aren't that cheap xd
9:45 he said cows were coldblooded animals.
There should be a law requiring  that every child does this as a class project. How can we feed the 10 billion in 2040/2050? This should be as simple as reading and writing for us. We are symbiotic. oh. and. I got here from Linnaeus.:)
it wouldn't be hard to install. It just wouldn't do any good. Hydro-turbines turn potential energy from the height difference in water into electrical energy as the falling water turns the turbines. He would need a constant source of water coming into the greenhouse at a sufficient height above ground level to generate any electricity.
This is seriously cool.
I feel some new breeds of Cannabis coming! I would call it "fish shit's "
It would be really expensive considering the output. You still need the water pumps to operate throughout the night to keep the water aerated enough for the fish to breathe and the roots to get enough oxygen, so he would need to invest in a battery array and power inverter. Perhaps some kind of peltier junction could provide constant power without a batter array.
See this interview with Douglass Malette of the Zeitgeist Movement.  He's done this with his company "Cybernated Farm Systems" /watch?v=mL5laU-tY9Q
I am also very interested in the system to monitor conditions and to automate responses because I also need to travel for work. Could you share what components and software you are using?
Hi Rob I Like your setup I would like to know the monitoring system, does it only check the temperatures or check the water quality (PH, Ammonium, Nitrate etc) as well? I am planning to setup one in my garden and did lots of research I can't find any hardware or probe to test water quality.
Hello great system you´ve build, and also great video. i would like to know what software and hardware you use to automate your green house, i have a setup similar to yours in Venezuela but i have to manually  check thate verything flood and drain propperly and i want to do something like you did that will let me check from work that all is doing ok my mail: douglase.palm@gmail. anay advice  you can share will be highly apreciated. thanks and congrats on your great aquaponic system.
fish were for the mosquito problem not the fish
Use DIATOMACIOUS EARTH for your aphids and bug problem.  Its 100% natural no chemicals.  It comes from the Ocean so it won't hurt your fish.
i saw only 4 or 5 fish in the tank, is tha enough for to many plants?
If you hook solar panels up to ANY aquaponics system the system could be self-sustaining. :)
Its a process. But we will get in down, since we have nature in our back. : ))) All the best to yall. Love Unity and Peace In Lak'ech
18 ppl like pesticides.
Try companion planting to keep the aphids and bugs away. Pungent smelling plants like marigold, tomatoes or herbs like corriander (cilantro), garlic, mints etc will help maintain a balance.
buy ladybugs  for aphids  just release them into the  greenhouse
very cool
great video and amazing set up!! the program on that laptop must make management of the hole system a dodle, how long have you been using the green house set up and how long did it take to set up? If you don't mind me asking.
I'm pretty sure that the water goes from the fish tank continuously to the grow bed, which fills up then drains when the bell siphon starts- the siphon stops flowing when the level drops. The siphon dumps into the sump, where a pump sends the cleaner water back up to the fish tank.
This is incredible. I'm very interested in building a very large unit, to grow my own fruits and vegetables. Lots and lots of vegetables, after seeing the documentary Forks Over Knives. Thank you for posting this video up. Great work.
Why do you have the water from the fish tank going to a bin and THEN going to the plants? Why dont you just take the water straight from the tank?  Im building my own aquaponics system and would love any advice you have on the matter.
i have anohter question... how many months for water waste replace a new one? cuz many fish got lot of poops or green water is not good healthy or keep it or what..i am first time like rookie.. thank pls email me omid3dman@gmail.com
If you have ever gone to the country & seen Milking operations- they literally liquify animal waste as its washed & sprayed out of the stalls- down into a swill pond. Then hauled field to fields spraying it on-U C- all our foods are grown in "Poop" -at least this system dose not have hormones in it like in milk ops, where they 'force' 20% extra Milk production,& this "extra" only pays the bill on the extra costs of the antibiotics Needed to stop the constant mastitis the Cows suffer from.
VERY cool video. Being both a gardener AND tropical fish enthusiast, I did some experimenting with combined system like this many years ago. I am pleased to see it has become somewhat popular.  One thing I want to point out is that not ALL plastic containers are safe for something like this. Plastic tends to leach chemicals into the water.
Throw some ladybugs in they'll destroy those aphids!
Is "Not"
We grow 1000 catfish in a pond and use effluents from the pond to our garden. It is for training and learning. I wish to extend it to 50K or may be 100K catfish in time and to use the effluents to our farm with sugarcane. Dreams, dreams, dreams. The reality is so that to be a farmer you have to save every cent, as the profit margin is so narrow. The idea is to cover cost of fertilizers, at least in part, by growing of fish. Fish pays for itself if to sell it. The effluents are for free.
He didn't say the cow was cold blooded, the fish are.
i like the indoors one he has, if he hooked that up to a solar panel couldnt the whole unit be self sustaining???
now we need to use this knowledge and processes to save the earth by planting plants everywhere. green roofs and green walls and urbans forests. lets go!
This is soooo awesome I'm so doing this when I get back to stateside...
a cow is cold blooded???
He didn't invent it
Smart guy!
whered you get that greenhouse kit
Hey kristendirkson try diatomaceous earth (DE) in food grade only.  Will not hurt your fish.  Kills bugs like shards of glass to them.  Shreds their exoskeleton open and they dehydrate to death.  Check videos out in youtube.
sweet greenhouse
Is there anyway you could share the software program to monitor greenhouse conditions.
Screw you.  People put the negative votes on because they are pissed off I am WAY smarter than them.  They could try to learn from me but Douchebags just vote down intellectuals they do not understand.  And they will all die when the SHTF.
Can you tell us how you computerized your aquaponic system?
Hello I've recently came across your video and i'm curious about how you built your system with your computer. Could you discuss how you did it?
Fuck you.  I am not a troll. But you may be.  Your brought nothing constructive to the conversation.  You just breeze in and make an accusation.  Therefore, Troll.
Thanks for posting this video, It helped inspire me to start an aquaponics project on my channel.
Oh sorry. Completely misread what you said. I am not sure whether it is cruel, some say it does some say it does not, but yeah, a bigger sized aquarium would be better, especially as the fish can easily overpopulate as well.
You misunderstood.  He is abusing that fish by keeping it in an aquarium way too small.  Poor fish.  Some envoronmentally conscious person he is.
great video!I am planning on building a system such as this and i was wodering about the ph levels.Do you monitor and how do you adjust if needed?I have used distilled white vinegar for my soil garden but havent done any hydro and don't know if the fish would be ph sensitive.
What...? I am not too sure how aquaponics actually works, but I am sure that it is environmentally friendly and the food produced is far better than traditional agriculture.
Symbiotic my ass.  You want symbiotic, run your own sewage through the system.  And yes you can safely do that.  This guy is a douche.  Don't try to teach when you really don't know WTF U R talking about.  Ammonia from the gills?! LMWAO  And U dont need a charcoal filter for an Aquarium.  What he needs to do is put that fish in an appropriately sized aquarium.  How would he like to live the rest of his life in that fucking greenhouse.  Environmentally sound my ass.  Douche Alert!  Douche Alert!
Techno-Gardener.
Very talented, an imaginative.  I'd like to do this, but how would you keep the water temp down in a (fish tank) if you live in a "hot" desert area?  Thanks for sharing.  Cheers!
i let 1500 ladybugs go in mine so there arent any aphids
The fish's waste is what feeds the plants. The sunlight gives it the appropriate vitamins as well. Hence the common word used in aquaponics is creating a "Symbiotic" relationship between the fish and plants. A lot of the nutrients the plants get is from the soil, but there is no soil. I assume the fish's waste is what gives the plants the appropriate requirements to produce fruit and vegetables.
Plants can not survive on only the one nutrient, just as people can not live on one vitamin. Unless the other nutrients are getting in there, I don't see how the plants live. I have only heard of ammonia, nitrate, and nitrite. Where is all the rest?
Nice i really like ur greenhouse!
It also states about what the owner is doing for the environment as well, whilst results may vary when you do DIY stuff, but overall it's good. It says that you help conserve scarce water resources, as well as it being cost effective of energy, also producing food locally and an environmentally friendly way of growing food without needing additional chemicals.
I quickly read the paper analysing aquaponics being cost effective and better.  First off, it uses very little water, as well as producing fresh food, and if you use edible fish for it, you will get fresh, healthy fish.  Second, the maintenance of the plants require little labour and time investment. You don't need to spend money on chemicals or fertilizers, as well as no soil improvements. Therefore comparing aquaponics to traditional farming does show cost effectiveness as well as fresh food.
I'm new to aquaponics, but I have been gardening in dirt for a few years now. I have looked on different sites and none of the ones I've seen said any thing about nutrient deficiencies. Can plants grow well only in nitrates, or do you have to put in minerals such as calcium, magnesium, sulfur, iron and others. Also I have not been able to find any plans for building a grow bed, or how thick the sides would have to be. Any help would greatly be appreciated. Thanks.
Yeah, but how much do you pay every month in your electricity bill to pump all that water constantly? I'm all about sustainability, but it seems like you'd pay more for upkeep than you'd save on your food bill. Cool hobby, but is it really cost efficient?
Love this set up!
Jaw was dropped for five minutes before I noticed. Well done!!
Very cool set up. Im impressed
That's great.  And using the water to irrigate the plants would also filter out particulate matter, which would be good fertilizer, too.
I don't know what government you're referring to, but there's more than just one. 196 last I checked. Business isn't national anymore. It's global. And there's quite a few that would want this kind of thing around to make them look good. And others with very limited real estate, like the Asian Tigers, Hong Kong, and Japan that would see the value in this. These could be on the roof of any skyscraper. Food literally dropped from the roof would drastically cut transport costs. Open your mind.
You never want it to go commercial, when it goes commercial the government wants a cut so they regulate it and it pushes small farmers like this out of business
he was going through filters like crazy. i think the veggies are just a perk so he can keep that giant goldfish.
i love the modest scale of your setup.  It looks do-able and it doesn't take over your whole yard!  I am impressed with the practicality and the simplicity. :)) it is inspirational.
I wonder if you have Rob's email. I am interested in cosulting with him. Thanks
amazing system! not so awesome edibles! why install only to grow lettuce and carrots?
I have a question about the production techniques. How much CO2 do the fish put out? Is it enough to raise the ambient concentration to at least 1300PPM? Because THAT is where your yield would come from in a closed-loop system. THAT is what would make this a viable technology. CO2 can double the production of crops.
This... is just genius. With the right plants and the right fish this system could be viable for mainstream, commercial, agricultural production.
@ 7:09 thats a huge goldfish
There are further ways to save on energy also, you can use solar and wind methods to run the pump.  For feeding the fish I have seen some use the parts of veggies you don't eat, fish will eat those too. Also there's a plastic sealed container I have seen people use to grow maggots from the veggie waste. (sorry I don't know the name of it) - Its a container that has 2 voids in it connected by a tube, you put your waste in the main box and the maggots crawl up the tube into the other void.
Ye good luck makin the money back on that set up.
what kind of hardware do you use to control monitor your green house on your laptop
why not just have bottomfeeding/vegetarian fish so when you trim dead leaves from your crops you can have your fish eat those, save about 10-20$ because fishfood is expensive, if i recall correctly
Ecology  Nitrifying bacteria are widespread in soil and water, and are found in highest numbers where considerable amounts of ammonia are present (areas with extensive protein decomposition, and sewage treatment plants).[2] Nitrifying bacteria thrive in lakes and streams with high inputs of sewage and wastewater because of the high ammonia content.
Wheres the maryjane patch? You missed that part..
Me gusto... I love it....!!!!
Harbor freight has them
Where did u get the greenhouse at?
Good guess. He's an IT director.
This is Amazing! Just what i want to build!
Great video!
VERY COOL!!!
Wow !!!   Kudos !!!!!   I am so so impressed !   I probably cannot afford all your equipmente but I am surely going to try it a bit easier way.
That must be the world's most expensive veggies. The water tank takes up space that could be used from growing, the pumps have to be powered, and the fish have to be cared for. All to get a little fish poop fertilizer. Containers would have been much more efficient. As long as he's digging his hobby, that's cool. Guys used to have toy trains - now they ave aquaponics.
though I think it might not be, it appears not to move throughout the whole vid.
thankya. Though my eyes are trained to see just that, it's what I live for XD
Bet  people are growing some crazy ganja doing this.
Good eye, lol.
2:08 is that a lizard on the leaf???? natural insect control, maybe? Props on that! I love a few reptilian or amphibian counterparts in a greenhouse.
How so? You're supposed to ensure there's no still open water on your property anyway---that this forces them to rely on your aquaculture water, where they will die and feed your fish, is only a triple-side-bonus, as they're normally only reduced in the area by removing still water---not decimated. . Mosquitoes are unbelievable here. They swarm you in clouds. Before you're done wiping them off an arm they're back on. In your ears, nose, mouth, eyes. Swarmed. Nothing is drastic against mosquitoes
See: /watch?v=3AZv6MjZylo
If you ensure that your aquaponic system is the only open pool of water in your surrounding area, the mosquitoes will have no choice but to use it for feeding, breeding, and laying their eggs---when they do, they will inadvertently feed your insect-loving fish, thus helping the mosquito issue.
The easiest way is to take a single wide PVC pipe, draw lines 40% the circumference of the tube at every 1 foot interval, either on the same side, or staggered opposing sides, depending on the light it will be receiving---cut on your lines, then use a heat gun to make one side of the cut floppy (other side must stay stiff), press it inward, leaving a small gap at the back. Do this for all cuts. You end up with cascading 'pockets' that drain into one another. With grow medium these work very well
I LOVE THIS STUFF.  I'M so passionate about organic food, organic growing, and building this stuff in my home.  I want to farm fish to eat, and Asian fruit to eat.
you have a fat ass fish! 7:35
You should make a small anaerobic digester to run either a simple furnace or small generator to heat your greenhouse during winter. Simply by feeding it your organic waste and personal sewage, you can heat your greenhouse all year round.
Do you put aquarium salt in the fish tank?
Nice system.  I like the vertical grow tubes.  Did you melt the PVC, then crush it?  250 cucumbers off the plants?  Wow!  Nice work, man.  Cool homemade float valve!  Check out my Sub Greenhouse on my channel.
That was great.  Thank you.
awesome setup
i personally have found murray hallam from australia to be one of the best to learn from, he seems to be a leader in the industry  aquaponics . net i believe it is, is a great site with pretty much all the info you need, there are also many more vids on youtube, the bacteria is naturally occurring anywhere there is water  fish food,-fish waste=ammonia-nitrites-nitrates-plants-back to fish cleaned, thats the whole process very quickly summed up  its magical tech
very interesting in all the aquaponics stuff ive watched and read, i never read about the common sense idea of using the water as a heat sink type thing  also i know hes only doing what we all do at the 8 minute mark, but we all should try not to reach into the water to touch the pump while plugged in, while not often, people do get electrocuted that way
I am cloning crayfish to feed my cat. I did Talipia outside last year but crayfish are less desease prone i found. Marbled crayfish eat table scraps too,
You could eliminate the cost of fish food by growing worms on the side, and supplementing with duckweed.  A separate tank will grown LOTs of duckweed, and add a handful every day to the fish.  And leave the top open to the light, the algae will also feed the goldfish.
too poor to build one but hope to do so soon this year. Love your outdoor system!
oyster shells are a good filter and ph stabilizer
Love this video!! You have inspired us to start our own aquaponics system in Trinidad (west Indies) with our existing Koi pond.
Good Job thaks.
@Ismm1337 I agree, I was wondering why he didn't do that either.  Some things just don't cross peoples minds though.  Beautiful setup regardless.
Outstanding video. Thanks, it's very informative and that's is one large goldfish !
This is an amazing young man. I am sure his parents are incredibly proud of him, and I can see that he is also pretty darn proud, too - he deserves nothing but praise for this endeavor. Well done!!
This is John Malkovich on Hydroponics.  I would like to pick your brain and do some knowledge transfer, you might end up doing some acting, but I will be growing veggies like no one else's business.
i bet this dude really got into ant farms.
so you can get veggies AND meat all in one self-regenerative system. Holy shit batman.
@MrYoubrian I would be hesitant to put only crawdads in there, but a couple of sucking bottom-feeders (like Catostomidae) and a bunch of crawdads would be fine. The problem with just crawdads is that there is nothing to clean their backs. If you do crawdads and fish, make sure to provide some cover for when the crawdads molt, and then have some way to see when they need to be cleared of old exoskeletons.  watch?v=qrnHi0YbKUY
@TheIndustrialphreak What about using Neem oil to control aphids?
you can eat goldfish. theirs no laws about it unless you live in the UK
Brilliant!
This is awesome!! I have recently become introduced to Aquaponics, the idea just blows my mind! Could you share some details or do a follow up about your system? How many gallons? How many gold fish per gallon? What is the total growing surface area? ... Details Rob.... Details. I don't give a thumbs up often..but.... :-)
you get Weed? Wow!   People are going to want to put one of these up right away then....
@ritewng1 I only filmed a video with Rob for my channel (though he does sometimes visit and reply to comments). You can also check out his youtube channel. His username is: web4deb
Can you use freshwater crayfish or crawdads instead of fish?
fuckn youtube
Awesome, one question: You welded the framework, what did you use for the actual beds? did you weld those as well? or are those some sort of livestock feed-bins lined with pond-liner?
thanks for sharing very cool
Dude it looks like you're weeding out purslane! eat that stuff. It's a great vegetable for salads or for eating anyway you'd prepare spinach and is very, very high in omega 3, it even has significant amounts of EPA omega 3 which is remarkable for a plant. It has slightly tart, sweet taste.
this dude is a flat out genius!!! would you be willing to travel and help construct one of these things? (get paid for it of course)
@panamayogadivina The indoor system, yes. You don't even need daylight if you're using the grow light. Of course you have to factor in energy costs for the lighting, but some people find it worth it for fresh, local, organic food. And if you have a great window perhaps you could get by with some vegetables just using daylight.
FANTASTIC!!! can i do this in an apartment??
@louididdy Good idea, but I would use a linux based mini pc on mine!
As someone who just heard about aquaponics days ago, this is the best setup I've seen yet.  The only thing I would change, as a noob, is to make it solar powered and to add a Mac Mini as the computer that controls it.  No need for a monitor, you can just VNC into it from any other computer/tablet/phone.  Awesome job.
r wut yall eet! trapped gold fish waste in trapped life not great either
@BobThantos Me to and now I'm looking at how to do this on a larger scale
Big fan of your set up, especially how you have it completely automatic.  Just found out about aquapoincs tonight and can't wait to get started.
@snobahr I've read that cannabis is one of the most dangerous drugs known to man...but we all know that isn't true either.
@yanni318 I've read elsewhere that pot is toxic to fish, so, no.
@ugkcdrock I didn't ask him in the interview, though I have heard some aquaponics gardeners talk about how for some seeds that germinate quickly (e.g. lettuce, carrots) they plant them directly in the growing media and others that need a bit more nurturing/time (e.g. tomatoes, spinach) they plant in a starter media.
does he plant the seeds directly in the gravel media? or does he plant them in a finer mix, to transplant?
Wow totaly amazing setup. Gave me loads of ideas thanks
very nice ,looking in to it as well just have a lot to do before i can start,thank you for your post,God bless
@yanni318 lol yes and you can then call your ganja 100% natural because alot of growers produce it hydroponicly which normally uses alot of chemical nutrients, plus since pots a pickey plant itl get plenty of nutrients from the fish.
@yanni318 it wouldn't be practical because it would be hard to get high levels of phosphorous in the water...it would be easier to do it without the fish so you can regulate nutrients better....but yes, you can do this with herb if you would like, just not most effectively.
"This is a little weed!"
whats the total watt usage?
@jenikyula Yes, it uses about 80 to 90% less water than conventional farming.
where did you get the greenhouse. btw great video.Im inspired.
This is such an excellent video. Started backyard aquaponics last summer and recently helped build a larger one for a school and this video touches on so many topics and systems I have been exploring. I love that it focuses around how a basic home system that doesn't have to be a major investment. Coming from a utility control background, I have been looking for a computer monitoring system without having to re-invent the wheel. Would like to see an update on your system.
and let ladybugs into the outdoor greenhouse they will control the aphids. Good luck !
try a hot compost to maintain temperature for edible fish.
question: you said not to use any kind of insecticides with an aquaponic system, but do you know if diatamaceous earth would hurt the fish? thanks :)
Wow, cool system you made there :)
@greatruaha1 I feel I must respond to this since I am the subject of this video and own this setup.  These fish are well cared for and I always keep less fish per gallon than most people do.  There is no need to put objects in a tank as they have no desire to be entertained by them.  In fact, objects can be a hazard where they can be injured against them.  She is about 6 years old and will easily live 25-30 years unlike most people that end up flushing them in a year or two.
This is by far the best backyard greenhouse/aquaponics joint venture I have seen. Any advise on building one of these? Looks like a good prodject for this coming summer.
Best video introducing home aquaponics I've seen, great job.  I've already got a similar (smaller) indoor setup, working on a larger outdoor one now.  I'm in Texas and hoping to get away with not having a greenhouse, but if I expand further I may go that route.  Love the automation and monitoring system you've got, I'm hoping to have that one day too!  Keep it up.
Maybe I missed it, but what do ya feed the fish?
@Excrematorium Duck weed grows very fast and it is what many fish naturaly eat. Algae is also easy to grow. To make a complete diet black soldier fly larva can be cultuvated with house hold scraps to provide protein.
@ukenovice No, people get freaked out by cucumbers because they're shaped like penises. DUH!
Even chem trails can't get his cucumbers.
What do you feed the fish? Can you not get chemicals into your system through the fish food?
This is great, thanks for sharing
Very cool system. I'm considering building a system to keep the organic vegetable flow going as I cope with Lyme Disease (again). I'm going to refer to this video frequently as I set it up. Thanks!
and the light bill??
@Living4fishing You can definitely plant tomatoes and peppers as well. Rob plants both of those, as well as cucumbers and carrots and strawberries, etc.
This is brilliant.  It doesn't make sense anymore to till the yard to grow our tomatoes for the sauce we make every year.  This is a lot less maintenance!!  The only prob is how do I get my traditional Italian parents to start growing tomatoes with fish instead of hard labour.  :D
@daverjohnson Exactly I'd like to to see full grown peppers, tomatoes and pumpkins even.
Go Rob !  Awesome man !
Obviously a good idea but the plants do not look very green or healthy.  Have you got any pictures showing more mature healthy plants which have been produced this way?
Your wrong about hydro...you can keep the roots in the water all the time, its DWC
Thanks for the vidio. Well explaned.
You are a genius.
actually on lettuce farms they use fish meal as fertilizer, cow or pig animal waste is a HUGE health violation.
@nemesisbreakz I don't think warm weather is a problem. Aquaponics is very popular in Australia. I've heard one of the benefits of aquaponics in warm weather is that the plants are sure to get enough water.
Very beautiful.
Would this type of system suffer in the midwest during summers where temps can reach 100+ ?
thats the hugest goldfish I have EVER seen!
@gfhnk I don't know what monitoring softward Rob uses. He works in IT so he's much beyond I am in that area. I just made the video with him, but he has﻿ his own youtube channel at web4deb, as well as a blog at web4deb . bloodspot . com
Hmm feeding plants with nitrogen only..
@MrAubery easy way to clean it would be to throw out the grow medium, and get new. Or, you could rinse them off easily enough. It's not too difficult to maintain this type, or any type of hydroponic system.
ummm, you CAN keep the roots submerged in water. Deep Water Culture, also called Bubbleponics, do exactly that. In DWC, there is an air pump that pumps air into the nutrient solution, to keep it aerated and the roots growing healthy.
@Jackslament1993 I'd agree.. anything beyond basic dirt, water, sun and plants and I feel overwhelmed. But for some, this seems straightforward.. or at least, fun.
@Jackslament1993 He is saying that fish- not cows- are cold blooded so don't carry E Coli in their gut.
How well do root vegetables grow, like radishes or beets?
HI, great system, and great presentation.  Did you come up with the data system yourself or is that available for purchase?  Thanks Derrick
For the bug problems, ladybugs work great and they are easily acquired at your local garden store.
@MrAubery throw in red wiggler worms and they consume the solids.
melon would be good in there
@TheWitchWay Yes KILL the messenger. There have been cases of people getting arrested because of growing tomatoes and stupid neighbours and police couldn't tell the difference. And this guy with his hydroponic stuff is susceptible to a stupid neighbour who hears hydro and thinks it must be pot. I myself had to show police once I wasn't growing pot in my greenhouse. People are more stupid than you think.
Aquaponics with John Malkovich
Lol the dude is going to have police raids because of people thinking hes growing pot.
fish water has electrolytes...its what plants crave!
Do those fish mate?
Great stuff inspiring work, have learnt a lot here .... peace !
@gun561 Check out aquaponicscommunityDOTcom, look in the forum about wicking beds, they use topsoil and might be something you'll be interested in.
PROOOOOOOOOO!!!!! i wonder whether i can put tadpoles and turtles in the mix as well. Don't have to worry too much about smells too!
@gun561 No, topsoil will turn into mud, drown your roots, and clog your drains. The granite allows water to drain off and allows air in. But you can use pea gravel or hydroton.
Absolutely BRILLIANT!  :)
An excellent, inspiring little documentary, Kirsten. As always!
Thanks for sharing this.  I too am an aquaponics operator. In cold weather (Long Island) I use blue channel catfish. fry are about $1 & they're plate sized in about 22 wks. They can survive through a NY winter. As long as your tank is situated below your grow bed(s), the bell siphon will agitate the water enough to prevent freezing. If your system becomes to alkaline (usually due to minerals in the grow media) you can grow celery - they love it. & will lower the pH.
Hey AshyMishyMashy, those fish arent scared they are just excited and looking for food. All my fish in the aquaponics know me and get excited when they see me cause it means food time
Thats a massive goldfish:D
@AshyMishyMashy They need a plastic sunken ship:D TO PETCO!
realy nice setup i like it a lot thanks for vid
would like to see a diagram as to the plumbing system you have i'm very interstred nice job
What do you feed your fish?
Does it matter that that vegetables are not being grown in a food safe container? Is there a problem with leaching of the chemicals that the plastic is made out of?
Really interesting! Well done!
nice stuff, thanks
This is great!
