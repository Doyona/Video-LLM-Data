I have not seen a bucket used for air filtration before - most are some sort of box build - thumbs up for that alone - easy build and cheap to make - good job!
This will go viral in 2025
What happens if we put fan in reverse direction? Will it collect dust inside the bucket,  will it be helpful?
7 years damn and here I am doing a diy and some research on this before building one in 2025 will cost me around 2000-3000 Indian rupees. Let's see how it really goes like.
Wow
isn't it way too fast than necessary, can we install a regulator to control the speed of exhaust fan
A bucket...???? Why didn't I think of that..!! You're a genius... Thank you..!
Cheap and effective that works for me
Good old pen and paper, can't beat it.
I heard HEPA filters requires a lot of air pressure to force the air through and normal fans cannot provide this pressure. Are there specialized fans better suited for this? Please advise. thanks
This is so cool! 😃 Kudos to you, man!
From where can we get the filters
Use ac in fan mode.that also filter air.wash airfilter every week.
Nice

Hey Vikas I just watched this video one 👍 friend. However I have query regarding hepa filter cleaning. Do we have option to clear filter or replace the  filter. How long in a period we need to clear it
Superb, I was looking for something like this. Very good design, simple and serves the purpose right 👍
Very nice idea. Only issue I feel is to replace the air filter. It is glued. It needs to be on a detachable frame.
👍👍👍👍
"in 2019, this list helped me decide for the best air purifier *scafe.shop/tbap2019?1Q* hope it helps you out too!"
Very Easy & practical with 100% EFFECTIVE device that too value for money. Pl. let me know  about the filter how to clean it.  Thanks  Rakesh Babbar

Nice man
What to do with the computer cable?
Will it be working?There is my science exhibition.
I couldn't find the HEPA filter? Where can I get that?  Could you please mention the link in the description of the video itself?
awesome bro there should be 20k likes there
My brother has one that filters everything through water. He dumps the water every week and cleans it. Puts a few drops of smell good oil and it's good to go. He has animals and wall to wall carpet. It works good.
So easy! You should start manufacturing!
Fantastic.  I was searching more practical home made air purifier. Awesome.
Hi, bro  Fan direction Which side keep? In side! Out side
Thanks ✌🏼
Brother please say where you purchase HEPA filter ?
Kindly send links to buy these types of filters. In India it's difficult to find.
Great idea, using a bucket!
Please list all parts needed. thanks
🖒
I am constantly amazed at the ingenuity and creative in this world.  So pleased that the political system allows such things.
Thank you. Nice work. Can you tell me where I can buy the filter online ?
Fantastic
Nice Project. The filter is sucking polluted air and fan gives filtered air right? I am making this and I have a question. So in which direction should the hepa filter be inserted?
Where did you purchased that HEPA filter from? If possible could you provide a link?
Thank you for such a great idea!  From Los Angeles California in US.  I will be making mine tomorrow!
Where can we buy hepa filters
But what's the principle behind its working? I mean, what makes you sure that all the air is being sucked into the bin through the filter in the first place?
Air scrubber for when missiles are flying between Bangladesh and Mumbai.
How about you test the purifier with a before and after 2.5 micron ppm reading from a digital meter?
What if the space between the air purifier and bucket is too large to close with glue gun?
Plz give link of filter
Good work bhai ji! Subbed Guy from same group: BAC :)
👍
Gajab ka idea hai.... chaa gaye guru
Nice work buddy....But pre filter b lagao....or the hepa will go bad very quickly.
