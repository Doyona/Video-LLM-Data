Oh Nancy, I miss you!   RIP.   Even in Heaven you’re teaching me to sew!  Love the final option!
Brilliant!!!! I always had rollover Great tip
What are the green mats called?
Rip
How does this plastic cutting mat work. Cut down every line on that shape cute plus how does this work I don't want to mess up the blanket if I do it the wrong way and etc.
Thank you I am ordering all this supplies today from Amazon going to try this out for the first time.
Does both mats have to be big or can they be smaller Matt.
I was very much but here in Serbia has no maps and rotary cutter
I have never seen the scallop blade, or the blade you used to make the cuts for hand sewing.  Wonderful.  Our girl scouts will enjoy trying the hand sewing mehtod on a small blanket.  Thank you.
Thanks
