Great tutorial, one of the best demonstrations I've seen .
Hi. What type of glue are you using? I see it holds fast.
Your detail is out of this world!  Are you an artist, took classes, are just a genius!
Wow awesome
Best one I've seen. And your tutorial was very clear and easy to follow. You are a very talented woman! Thank you for sharing! = )

Wonderful
This is amazing! You're an inspiration. So clever to use wet coffee stir sticks. But now I'm thinking the stir sticks I have are bamboo, so I guess I'll try and see if that works as well as the wooden ones. Do you think it'll work?
Great job!  About what scale is this?
Can you use foam board also, for a project like this?
tengo  muchas ganas de  cagarme
That's amazing!
I can’t believe that your channel hasn’t come up in my suggestions at all! This is amazing work x
Very realistic looking and no complicated material! LOVE IT!
What is the scale?
Amazing!!
I do mot see your scale anywhere. Is this smaller than 1/12?
Hi what’s the scale? 1:12?
Hello I have watched this video several times and wonder if I am missing something or what. You said to cut the centers out of the oval bowl part but when you start to glue them together it is like they have graduated in size. Small one on the bottom and larger one on top did I misunderstand? Love your videos made your pool table and entertainment center they came out great. With all that entertaining  need a bathroom.
What are the dimensions of this when finished?
that is unbelievable.
You truly have a gift!
Where are you Kat??? We need some videos now more than ever!! I haven’t seen anything from you in a long time. When I started watching your videos, you had less than 300 subscribers. I’m so proud to see your audience has grown. Please let us know you’re ok.
This is great! Thank you for sharing.
The DETAILS!
I’m so glad I found your channel because I love playing with Barbie dolls! My granddaughters like them too, but when they aren’t here I’m fine playing with them by myself. 😁🥰
You are AMAZING! I always learn something watching your videos....and most importent I admire how you recycle and repurpose things, and create  from non-obvious raw materials. Thank you!
Awesome!
i appreciate you
😍👏👏👏👏
You are so amazing! Thank you!
Warm water will speed up this process just thought you’d like a tip
Wow! You are amazing.
Thank you for making this video. I thought I was going to have to buy polymer clay and sculpting tools but I already have lots of balsa wood, which I prefer working with anyway. This is brilliant.
Your creations are absolutely amazing! 😊
You're soooo talented! I have a big dollhouse that I want to renovate, and your vids are so helpful! I discovered your channel a few days ago and subscribed just after :) You created the only real looking toilet on yt! thank you so much
You are such a smart crafty lady!!!!  👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Awesome
What kind of glue are you using for the wet wood?
Very informative and clever 😎👍
Wow thanks
I am just starting out doing miniatures, and I have to say, your videos have been very helpful. I'm not to the point of making toilets quite yet.. but I know where to go when I am! Thank you for being so exact, and not leaving anything to guess work. You're amazing, and I will be checking back with your channel for most of my miniature needs!
DO YOU HAVE A TUTORIAL ON YOU TOILET PAPER ROLL
Well done, I loved that you made your own hinges! I would have tried to sand the wood smooth before painting, to avoid the lumpy look. Porcelain is very smooth and that would be the look I would go for. But thank you for all the wonderful tips you have show us!
hey wer u from?
What brand of glue are you using it seems to dry very quick and love the toilet hinges thanks so much for that awesome tip and was the toilet painted or covered with poly clay please need a few answers ASAP for it’s for my grand daughters dollhouse for her bday in April the whole house projects so running outa time for everything that needs to be done thanks

Wow!!!! Your toilet is that only realistic looking toilet Ive seen in all of youtube!  You are sooooo talented!!!!
👍🏼👌🏼❤️
I really am grateful for this video. I am about to make a scaled model of the home i in-visioned for my fiance and myself.with no type of real experience, I've been all over YouTube for help. There aren't many videos that i watch that i don't  really enjoy. However, the problem usually erects when i realize that the materials are too expensive. and the videos with affordable materials lacked in realism. But ! your video, is a saving grace! I CAN AFFORD JUMBO POP CYCLES STICKS AND COFFEE STIRS. Thank you for flat out showing your measurements, and step by step process. your work s thrifty, without sacrificing the great  quality! it is beautiful and realistic.
You are amazing!!! Love your video's, thank you for sharing you talent
I've just started watching you and wow! you are so inspiring! Your explanations are really detailed and make your videos really easy to follow. I think you are one of the best miniature makers i have seen. I also love the fact that you use general household and easy to find items and you also tell us exactly where to get most things. FANTASTIC!!!!!
that is the most realistic toilet I've ever seen you are very talented i just subscribed after seeing your couch video with the chase lounge on it
That is amazing!
however did you think of this???   It's VERY VERY CLEVER- Bravo!!!
I have watched many videos  and I'm also subscribed to a few other people that show Diy's on miniatures they are all very talented in that field but I hate to say this but their toilets look like something thrown together yours really looks like a toilet... I love your work🤗
Hi! I'm new on You Tube. And you was my first video. Thank You so much!!! I'm making a dollhouse. And you have been a very big help to me. Your Toilet looks as nice as the ones you can order I think nicer. And the money I can save. Thank You Jan

Hi, new fan here (love your videos) but do you think you can make a miniature car? I've been searching youtube for a decent diy tutorial for one but they all suck.
