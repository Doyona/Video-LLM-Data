What is your imagination of the world in the year 2050?

Who is watching in 2025 because I am!

It’s 2025, and I see no progress being made; the world basically looks the same like 5 years ago. Sorry, people from 6 years ago

Who is watching in 2024 because i am !
1:33 in 2027
New calendonia ain’t independent

Who's watching in 2024
2050
Who is watching this in 2100?
We are at 8,115,00,000  6.15.24
Keeping tabs on this until 2050 and this current year is 2024  2019: bougainville is not an independent country as of 2024 but new caledonia is a part of france as of 2024. I couldnt find any concrete information on how many tesla cars have been manufactured in 2019 but i imagine this is also untrue due to the pandemic. Self drivings cars being allowed in the EU is correct but this didnt happen until 2022. Again i couldnt find anything on when the cage free zoo in denmark first opened but I do know it is open.  2020: the jeddah building is still under construction as of 2024 and doesnt plan to open within another 4-5 years. India as of 2024 has over 600m internet users but i dont know when this milestone was reached. As of 2024 6.8 billion people around the world use smartphones which is 70% of the population. Yes solar energy in the USA has become extremely economical and more efficient. There is no space hotel yet in the time of typing this but there is one being currently built and is set to open in 2025 (ill update you on that.)  2024: i cant find anything on spacex sendind cargo to mars but there is a mission that is being planned at the very least. As for internet being used by other home appliances kinda? I mean theres stuff like google home and alexa that can activate certain appliances if that counts. Surprisingly yes in 2024 a few prosthetic limbs with senses have been made. No state in the US as i can tell has a solar panel cost per watt that isnt under a dollar.  2025: the population has already reached 8 billion back in 2022.

I remember watching this video 3 years ago. When I watched it now, I wondered how much of the 2020 stuff was true now. Give that they would have never predicted a global pandemic causing everyone to remain indoors for several months, several times (depending on the country) and causing job loss and economic decline. 2020 the year of the unplanned, yet organised global resection.
Lol 2020 is a horrible year and 2021 so far
noooooo i dont wanna be an robot
Hmmmm
Jeddah tower was not completed 😕 its 2021 now.

If 10% of this comes true, humans are done for. Science never stops to think if they should do something, only can.   If theres a mini iceage in 2035, the artic ocean isnt melting totally by 2100
One time you said astronaut and the words spelt asteroid
I haven't heard of the Jeddah tower and its 2021 but it just might be that it was delayed because there id a global pandemic or I Just haven't heard of it and it is complete
Me watching this in 2021: in 2020 we will be doing online learning and have to stay inside wear masks so it will be the worst year

The Jeddah tower will be finished in 224
I Time Travel to 4004
I’m watching in 2020! Worst year yet. How’s 2021 y’all?
See about 80 percent of dreams i have are about the future. But it's not like 20 years in the future but not like a couple of days either. Usually i have the dreams. Then about 1 or 2 weeks later the same exact thing happens as it did in my dream. And so many people say its just me having a dream about something in thr past and the around the same thing happens in the future. But i can prove i have dreams about the future. I remember i had a dream about me, my friend, his 2 younger brothers, and his cousin all going to water wizz. But to prove i have dreams about the future. This dream was about me going to water wizz for my first time ever in my life. So i have dreams in the future.
i can already see it coming. the future will be like ordering an Uber that doesn't required drivers. and we basically just get dropped off daily to work or any other locations.
It's funny how he didn't mention the pandemic
2045
haha you didnt predict the virus didnt you?
planes going over 4000mph

Now make it 2051. BTW we (indians) have mostly completed connections of fiber optics.
I am from 3000 I can confirm all of this
none of that stuff happned
2:28 yeah but there is a virus ;-;
AHHHhhhh  IWANNA GO TO MARS~!
Who’s watching this in 2020? 👇
The space hotal theory in 2020
Aurora Spaceship? Sounds familiar to me.
I look forward to none of these things to me its just seems kinda scary
What will happen to the aestroid
Now it is 2020 and the Jedda tower is still not completed 😹😹
11:08
Me becoming a Bionic Superhuman Like in the TV show LAB RATS on Disney XD
2020: bla bla bla 2020 Reality: Oh dear, we are in a virus pandemic.  LOL🤣🤣
Am watching this in 2020? Also am going to Dubai next year :O
Your telling me we will all be females
Him: people are sending cargo to mars in 2024      Me: 2024 humans landing on moon   And then 2030 year finaly humans are at mars

Nothing changed in 2020
Oops!What about the virus
Godzilla to be a real thing
I am looking forward to absolutely none of these things!
They forgot to add something about 2020  •A deadly pandemic  •Social distancing  •No Halloween, Coachella  Yeah... a time traveller would want to move to Mars before 2020 😂
2:26 VIRUS

There is no hotel in space I'm in 2020
Click bait

Hey wait a minute we don't have a space hotel in 2020
You forgot a prediction for 2020.... WE HAVE A VIRUS ROAMING AROUND THIS WORLDDD!!!!!!!!
Who else is watching in 2020?
Thats funny i am watching at 2020 and most things didnt happen
Are you from the future
In my time 2020 there is a car 🚗 Tesla model x it is the car 🚙 of the future
Who's watching in 2020? How about 2021? But I'm watching in 2020, October 21. 😊
it didn't say that there was a virus that made life harder
2020 is the worst
Obviously nobody predicted that there would be a pandemic in 2020. No space hotel yet.
*the one thing they got wrong about 2020 is the pandemic*
Who is watching this in the year 2035
when u said next year  2019 im like u mean 2021
But it's 2020
My reaction to the first space hotel  Space hotel: Welcome to your hotel! We provide trips to the moon and mars!         Reality:Staying at home for 3-2 years and viruses roaming around the world and everyone using face sheilds and face masks.
its all wrong-

Almost none of this will happen you’ll see.
With the exception of the buildings being constructed, literally none of this or any of this will happen. We haven’t even built a full functioning human robot but in 9 years we will be banging robots. Yea and I’m playing shortstop with the Mets
Who’s watching this in 2050 because I am. Not actually guys
Me here from 2020 hello I am from the future everything is destroyed pls stop this from happening
bright side: in 2020 there will be space hotels 2020: you wish
i am watching this in 2020
But in 2020 there will be a global pandemic
I thought they we would truly become Woman
Screen less iPad on your arm
I hope no major wars in the span of 30yrs..😰😰
the thumbnail says the only gender that exist in 2050 is females
we will all die even before 2050 maybe.
BS - In 2020 we will have hotels in space .  2020 - Yeah we'll see
How about 2020 ,this year
by 2050, they finally fixed the ice capp machine
its 2020 bruj is tallest
After watching this in 2020 it seems so funny. Who would predict a virus would bring such chaos
2025:charging phone using wifi.      Me:That’s something useful right now
OOH self-driving cars in the EU and probably UK
I'm glad I'm 7 years old
5:46 the guy at the back lol left side
I hope I get reincarnated if I die, I still wanna see what humans will do to our mother earth
I can’t do nothing
2020 is fabulous
When you said let’s start with 2019 ohh that’s next year I was like what?!? but then I realized this was made 2 years ago and right now it’s 2020 so yeah😄
2:29 Dubai Creek Tower: I'm gonna end this man's whole entire career

In 2020 it's a curse
Trust me their prediction will not happen. See 2020 became so lame from what they predict they cant even predict a virus then how will these stuffs happen?
I don't want that to happen
2020: flying cars! real 2020: forgot to mention a fun ride on the pandemic express!

me i will travel back to 2020 and if its 2021 i will stay there and if 2022 im out i will travel back again in 2020
But 2020 has a hyper virus
if someone told me that in 2020 we will be on lockdown or they will be a virus i wont believe them
I dont like the fact that the earth will change its scary I want the old normal earth but the fact that lifespans will be longer is kinda cool

I have a super odd super power I have. I can see number for the lottery.
I dont want futuristic stuff. I like normal stuff
Just to let you know none of that will happen just saying
Hey guys, you wont believe this which is completely understandable. I live in the year 2123 and I can confirm that a load of what this video says is true. I'm using a radioactive time traveling device which allows me to contact people from past times. The one thing that isnt accurate is the timing of what this guy said. It will take somewhat longer for all of this to occur. The average lifespan is 140 years up to this point, theres alot coming up.
Edid:I wish y'all a marry Christmas and a happy new year
BRIGHT SIDE:uu that's next year!   Me:uu that's this year!  2020 in 8 day's!!!!
At 80, I doubt I'll make 2025 let alone 2050.,but if just some of those things come true, which i doubt, I will be happy to just be feeding the local worm population.

Hello past. Life is hard in the year 2050. Most of the weather is really hot but since your in the past you can change that! Please do. The oceans are quite dirty since us from the future have not been very careful. Sorry! But past people can change that as well. The internet is one of the only good things now. Please help the future!  From the Future

One of idiots things that capitalism produce is that learns u to act as individual n not a part of community,nope i m not a communist,but i dont support the idiocracy. Why the 0,01 of humans to ve the wealth of the 99,99%? Thats our planet goes to destroyed. They tell us don't smoke cuz u are pollute the others n i say the factories that destroy our environment why they keep exist?  I coukd say mores ,but thats enough,money must stop exist it s an invention 5000 years old n still we use it....money is a fake thing if u can understand this u are a smart person,also the coins of ancient Greeks were from silver mainly n less from gold so they had some power,todays coins are from cheap material n paper money is made from cotton...
How we ll colonise a planet?when we destroy our planet?

Asteroid will fall on earth Me: umm Nasa send me to mars or moon

I believe the narrator meant to say at 7:11 "The probability of the 'ASTERIOD' colliding with Earth in 2029." Makes more sense.... an ASTRONAUT wouldn't survive such a task.

Bright side!, I am from 2050i have just traveled from California. The date is August fourth 2050 and the space hotel blew up with 53 people on it
Me
2020- Donald J. Trump wins second term causing massive civil unrest in The U.S.A. that leads to the transformation of governance             from a constitutional republic with democratic elections to a military enforced dictatorship when martial law is declared. 2022-World economy implodes and all money everywhere has no value. Chaos ensues. 2024-Global e-currency implemented. 2035-Manned mission to Mars is successful- and no one cares because they are too busy worrying about the ebola pandemic. 2040-Automation of practically all factory and assembly work is achieved, as well as agriculture. Five billion people are unemployed and             drug abuse skyrockets. Prison industries become most lucrative stock world wide. 2043-Regional nuclear war between Pakistan and India turns into world war three. Human species bombs itself off the Earth.           The only survivors are a scientific outpost on the moon which is all male, and a small colony on Mars that depends on supply             shipments from Earth. 2050-The forests have begun to cover any trace the human race ever existed.
How many people are in 2050
Flying cars
_oh_
Well all Penguins and seals and polar bears are getting exint
My guest in 2050 human race will evolve as well as language. Technologies, transportation & society will evolve as well...... Crypto Currency, the worth of BitCoins will increase. RFID Chip implemented & Virtue Reality Gaming will be release.i also hear India will be a power country......Mars will be terraformed. Hate groups out there you going hate this but i believe a rise of Interracial marriages and dating will be at a ultimate high. Global warming with CO2 in our skies.....lastly entertainment & TV will be internet based.....picture TV eliminate net neutrality and you see it now with most SmartTVs comes with netflicks, Hulu & Ruko...cabel companies will lose money ......
7:12 he said astronaut not astroid  like if you heard     |    |   v

Who’s watching in 2020

I hope I die
Hello i am from da future
im in that year
Umm I'm in 2020!
When I was in the 3rd grade 50 years ago I remember they showed us a movie. On one of those old Bell &Howell projectors btw. The film speculated on how computers would change our lives for the better in the future. One advantage stated was how working people would have much much more leisure time. And how the average work week would be about 15 to 20 hours. WRONG.
I M watching in 2019 XD 😄
2019 isn't next year   THAT IS ALL I KNOW
If I happen to still be alive by then, I will be 81 years old.  2050 is/was 30 years, 3 months and 3 days from now/then.  And if my post manages to still be here in 2050, I posted this on Tuesday, August 27, 2019 at 11:48PM and I was 45 years old at the time.  That part is for anyone that happens to read this in 2050.  Kinda like a time capsule.  Please feel free to post a reply and post a message for anyone who may happen to see this in 2050.
Maybe just maybe. Theres another being, humans will see.
I dont understand, why didn't you get into consideration the plastic problem which is going in the world, instead brain washing people ?
Definitely when people get immune to disease!
If anyone is watching in 2027 I'd like you to tell me...     DO ROBOTS DO OUR CHORES??
What will happen when 3018

2050 will most likely be a horrbile time for those unlucky to be alive in it.

I weep for the future of humanity. We will be extinct by 2100 if we don't STOP global warming. Humans need common sense ain't nobody smart. Smart Scientists in 1968: Let's infect the world and make humans extinct! Smart scientists in 2019: Cut down trees. Litter. But don't know about the dangers. BUCK UP HUMANITY!

Judgement Day. the second coming of Jesus Christ to end this wicked world
The concept of singularity is quite fascinating.
So far, you only talked about the predictions of technology advancement. How about humanity in terms of sympathy, love, respect, patience and manners. I hope they will advance. As far as i could tell, in those things we have gone a bit backwards.

I mean I sometimes envy when US Military is going to go OP by using these sense simulations, or people being able to tinker with genes, its getting just scary now.

It is 2019
I'm not hearing anything that compelling
I’m noticing a lot of movies bringing up population control. I think that’s the major event that will happen before 2050. The question is, how will it be done? Will it be by  A.) Nuclear  B.) Natural Disasters C.) Planned Mass Murders D.) A Selection Process E.) A Virus “accidentally” released  F.) WW3 G.) A Civil War H.) None of the Above
To sum things up the world isn't getting any better
And in 2050 u Will talk about what will hepen in 2100
2050 anyone ?
In 2050 this video will be extinct on YouTube

nothing really happens now i am in 2019
Me when he said in 2019: Wait it is 2019
This kind of future is rather bleak to the one I think will occur. People will start to care more about one another and the planet and we will clean it up so it becomes a paradise again and friendly aliens will help us to further clean up and use energy sources that are non-polluting. The oceans will be cleaned and all water on Earth will become as pristine as nature allows. Aliens will also show us how to cure diseases and educate us on how disease is actually a problem with our energy flow and our psyche that affects the body so that we can stay healthy. And people will stop hating each other. It's a much more beautiful version that they are saying and those changes are to start being seen within the next 1-4 years. I'm waiting for that world.
i won't be alive anyway  hahaha
Sub to me I make game videos
When will we understand what comes after death? Or a way to have a reliable and guaranteed simulation or something for when death is near? Edit: also, 7:13 “astronaut.”

All you don't know in the near future God will run the sun into the earth and God said on the last days of the earth the churches lights will grow brighter and brighter and more people will surrender there life's to him.
What holds for me in the future HMM death
I in 2019
I do agree that the world will be overpopulated by people drastically in the future by 2050.  There are too many people now on Earth!  We need to control it now or there will be no place to live unless we go and colonize other planets
not possible so soon

Who was expecting to see a cure for CANCER  before 2050?
Who else 2019?
Who is here in *2020?*
I used to see the future as an amazing place, but now I'm terrified of the future. The future sounds horrible to me hoestly. There are some cool things about the future but now I think about all the animals that will be extincted, all the pollution and trash and litter, how climate is changing, I sometimes think about how much bigger the population will be and at some point the earth will be to small for everybody to stay on earth. Also the more in the future you go, the closer you are to death. Ok WeLl  ThAt WaS dEeP! But honestly tho this stuff is happening or will happen at some point.
Bright side i challeng you to what if
I.S.S.= In Space Suspension
I like the exponential growth of humanity...it'll tap and tax the natural resources of the Earth...these are the resources i'm invested in...waiting for my investment return.

It is 2019 now

You forgot Islam will take over the majority of the world like it have been happening in Belgium, the United Kingdom, France and India (some European countries are debating in imposing Sharia law thanks to the uprising of Islamic parties),  also it was forgotten the possible return to the dark ages but this time under a caliphate instead of a Christendom (the more things change the more they stay the same).

The real is when 2050 just wait it you will see that what’s happening
The 2050s will see a cultural revolution comparable to what happened in the 1960s and 1970s.  This will happen as people born during those decades begin dying off en masse.

Xd
whenever I heard about that colonization of Mars, my immediate thought was, "Ok good so if earth get destroyed by us then my kids will live on"
It's scary but, the likelihood of the prediction of the future ahead will become a reality ! The fact of the matter is man is imperfect and will make mistakes....but, with God all that is possible...for man has no control of his life and the future ahead of him and will always be in doubt ! For the will of man is his own self destruction...but, with God he is in control of all aboveground, on land and beneath the sea. The 🌏 is changing as we are also failing as we speak, failing to accept reality of the mysterious and unthinkable things that's happening in the moment of our existence....still in denial, then what more does people who are in denial now needs to see! The scriptures are not going away but, fulfilling what's happening and will continue...to happen as we speak to this very moment of our lives!🙏🏻🙏🏻🌏

The fact we think we are making progress is messed up we are screwing up more and more as we go. I’m sorry to the next generation. We are so money and technology deprived that we don’t care what we are messing up are home earth!! We look after house animals such as cats dogs rabbits etc that we don’t mind killing others such as cows pigs chickens, we should protect each and every animal in the world! We go to farms zoos saying aw how cute is that pig but tomorrow we could be eating it as bacon. We think we think we are cutting down trees but in fact we are cutting down our air supply every 100 years we are cutting down more than 50% of our air supply.
Trump doesn't want to use solar panels. He says climate change doesn't exist.

In fact that is provided for year 2050 where population will reach at 6 billion in cities is horrific. And proper measures should be taken to control population so that it does led to situation of crisis where people may have nothing to eat.

Well now it’s 2019 so...... uhm? Hi people in 9172
Noooooooooo not my blood!!!!!oooh I’m gonna be 23 when someone goes to mars
This was not in the video but  I will be 15 in 2025

When brain in plants come i am not going to get one
In 2020 there is the Tokyo Olympics-_- bright side how can you forget that?? ;-;
I found it incongruous that the narrator is speaking of intravenous implants to enhance human brain and sight  and we will be able to perceive x-rays and all sorts of other spectrum's, then around the conclusion of the video  I believe 2050, shortsightedness will be highly prevalent .....? I watch these , oft, entertaining meanderings into future possibilities. Then I find my mind rebelling against these flights of fancy. These quantum leaps in technology that are far from the realm of possibilities currently , are included into this tapestry of colorful yet highly specious claims , with one fantastical idea being the only support for the the next . It is the ultimate chicken and the egg scenario. So while this is a great sci-fi movie script; it is that and nothing more....As to weather change, the weather on this planet has always been in flux. The ice at the poles is still part of the ice which has been receding from the since the end of the younger dryas ice age. Considering the ice that covered the earth was miles high and has been melting for the last 12 thousand years does give one pause; while listening to those who act as if it were some new occurrence solely triggered by the actions of modern man. Do I believe we as a species should strive to more efficiently manage our natural resources, that we should not only strive to , but must reduce our refuse both physically, and chemically. Absolutely.
This is an lie I know it
And still One Piece won't be finished.
Well ima be alive at the best of times :3

I was in tune until he got to 2 subjects. The first one was the manipulation of genes to eliminate diseases. DISEASES ARE NOT INHERITED ! ! ! Dr. Joel Wallach has devoted his entire life of research involving naturopathic medicine and he has come up with absolute proof that genes are not passing on diseases, instead however the gene becomes damaged in the developing fetus due to a lack of nutrients. His proof has been developed into the study of Epigenetics, of switch he is credited as the co-author and chief scientist of the subject. My second disagreement with the predictions of the future involves the JFK assassination. The proof has been developed to be 100% correct along the lines of the killing was orchestrated by the CIA and could not have possibly been done by one man on the 6th floor, in fact Oswalt was not even on the 6th floor at the time of the assassination. Look it up, I am right ! ! !
Yay it’s 2019 new countries will they go into war

Dont say were gonna left earth and go to mars i know save earth from pollution aye
Future is exciting....ready?
I don't think the future is bright.  I think we are on the verge of a major regression in our society.  It has happened many times before.  2050 will look a lot more like 1390 that the world of the Jetsons.  Forget about space travel.  It's a pipe dream.  Technology and air travel and sophisticated medical treatments will still exist, but YOU won't have access to them.  Life expectancy will fall back to around 35.   Because of global warming, fresh water will be scarce, food will be scarce, but birth control will not only be available, but mandatory for many people.   Sorry, but that's where this all really looks like it's going.  Cheer up though.  If you're one of the 1% nothing will change much for you at all.  At least, not until the planet becomes uninhabitable.  Remember again, space travel is a pipe dream.  In the end, everyone will get what they deserve.
I'm in 2019 right now
For the trip to Mars they so stole the name from a game called subnautica.
I look Forward to Huver Boards
like if your in 2019
I know its weird to ask  but...if more and more people start  using cars and phones  stuff like that  what will happen to he planet?.and there is something I'm worry'd about the planet. So me and my school  are trying to stop the use of plastic because where all worry about the planet and, I think 5 years later theirs gone be WAY more plastic in the sea the fish, soon every 5 seconds theirs gone be 5 Lorie bins dump't in the sea. It meet not look like you have to worry now you meet say this "Lets just wait 5 years and then we can do something. nothing will happen" well that's may be true but we could help the planet now before it's to late
I love all of them thx for telling us!!
Well, we will never travel to Mars,(ever) that would be a one-way suicide mission. A better idea is to look after our planet Earth with the love she deserves!
As long as we don't get hit by the Astronaut you mentioned at 7:12
what about smoking
2050—ERROR 404 Pakistan not found.
Who’s here 2060?
Ooooog its next year
Before 2020?
If we had world peace, stop all famine and disease, pull everyone out of poverty, and have every human being contributing to the betterment of human kind. Then we'd accelerate our development 10 fold, at least. We'd be colonizing Mars by 2030.   Also, I wanna 3D print a Burrito.
Who's watching in 2030
Scary.
You missed WW3, it will destroy almost everything on earth. Only few people will survive living on Antarctica or Island. The earth will repeat history.

I think we have to save our planet earth 🌎 wich is very important for our lifes . And we don't wrilly know how is wrilly gona be our planet.So don't be so fantasy and begane in the wreal life and trying to think how we gina save our planet. They have so many reasons wich we have to find deper as we don't know and is do importan how ancient egyptian ,soumerian ,babylonian and mayas know all the knowledge. There we have to give emphasis lern protech , don't forget the antantis they have catastrophi coz for a lot of techonogy ... Is important as im a persnon who saw every day so mani documentaries has a sense...  Yes i believe we can find life and outside for our planet but first protect what we have and don't confuse the people .coz nobody wrilly know what wrilly happen.... And we are here to don't leave for ever....
Who is watching this In 2019
Hi Bright Side, I believe that unless we humans change the way that we are treating this planet, this planet that we call home will be uninhabitable.   We are repeatedly being warned by so many experts and scientists that we have just 12 years to reduce our green house emissions.  Sadly I believe that our world and its societies are too selfish and money driven to make the sacrifices that are required to save this planet from global warming, raising seas and oceans, and the extinction of most wild animal species and insect species.  I fear for my children and grand children, I don't believe that humans will be inhabiting this planet in 50 years time. But I hope that I am proved wrong!
Longer life
None
thanks for anxiety
Sounds scary... all of it
I won't be here, thank you very much!

More earthquake and unexpected weather change as well as extreme

Maybe we eill have new technology that we though is inpossible, like energy out of nowhere. We just have to wait and see while we still can.

Hello non gender specific offspring 👋🏾
2025. 2033
I heard that scientists are trying to freeze people so that they can live forever. I think that’s why we are living longer in the furture  They first freeze the dead body, then they unfreeze the body after awhile like 2 years or something then, they get to live forever.

We won't be humans anymore.  The world is getting worse and sad. One of this days we will say bye to earth and humanity. End the world.
I'm not sure I want to be around for this kind of a future...
Excuse me but... the world ends in winter of 2022.  Nothing will survive.
How do they make a hotel in space before making better WiFi!?! We want answers!

Well I never would've believed we would've had a mini hand held Computer, so?

Is it just me, or do you feel like humans will become extinct due to people giving us super abilities little by little until we ourselves are practically robots? 🤔
Hey man/woman/robot of 2050, I am the person writing this comment in 2019, so you can see this in 2050. Cheers!
2029

God made everything you dont know anything. Booooooooooooo 🗑 trash
Just saying something,nothing have proof
One thing is sure ... The earth will be in worst condition due to us
Who's here in 2020?
Sometime when i do something i had some deja vu feeling...
I'm a Christian i believe everything shall not happen without the will of God
No one can predict the future,
It’s 2019 and that hasn’t happened ;-;
I think Canada is already having a mini ice age like it was -45 a week ago and i'm not even that far up north
If a mini ice age is coming does that mean global warming is a hoax .Prevent the mini ice age drive more gas powered vehicals use more fossil fuels save the planet
I wonder if flat earther will try to go to space to prove space do not exist
Robots because I need one now well the best
Can the injectable brain plant cure my autism and my OCD
5:08, I’m pretty sure that an increased reaction time is not what you meant. If the time is increased then they are slower, what you want is a quick reaction time.
Cameras implanted into contact lenses sounds cool...useful in some cases, but terrifying in many. I feel like I can’t be myself then because people will record me normally and upload me to YouTube. Or what if people record others during intimacy and blackmail them??? What a scary world it will be. I will be 33 by then
I'll be 52 or 53 in 2050
7:12 astronaut???
Liar god is the only one who knows everything
*2019?*
Yay i live in Norway finally we can all use electric cars we have already 2 of them one small bmv and one tesla
oh my fleeping god
i love my disorders and my mind's privacy, please people do not take it from me in the future, i am still young ;-;
2050..... still lined up at Starbucks?!  haha XD
There actually could be 8 billion people already how about the third world country’s
who else ain't going to mars unless the world is about to end?
You did not anything about finding a natural harmless painless cure for baldness!!!
I will be alive if 2050 happens I won’t even be that old
Whe is here in 2050?
Where do I fit in this frame,.....
I most look forward to Jesus coming back to get the true believers
7:11 astronaut?
1% drop of solar activity
Am here watching, listening to this video make it to 2036 while asking and praying I make it out alive from 2019 to 2020. 😂😂😂😂

The thought of people being on Mars makes me wanna go explore it all by myself but that's just a pipe dream. I know that will NEVER happen
Hello from 2019 :D
What so the world is gonna end and we all dead
another prediction: trump fails to build wall in 2019, government unhappy with the month long shutdown that continues, well maybe the first part...no offense to anyone who thinks the wall is a good idea.
*scientist watches*  *calls team in* scientist: hey thats a good idea! we should get to work on that improving senses thing!!! Team: agreed!
Why doesn't the video put units in metric - it would offer some insight as to why 3,303ft (at 2:50) is significant - just over 1km in height. I realise that the US still uses Imperial but only one other still country does
I bet you lied about all of them
I don't want to be the future ): I like normal I going to miss the normal earth 😦
I won't allow that, rest assure of that
2029 world is ended
Whose Watching in 2026
This must be a old video it's 2019
I love past more😔😔 I get frighten about the future😮😮Idk why but it scares me🤔🤔  WHO ELSE THINK IN THE SAME WAY?
They will invent hover cars and I will be a celebrity
Is no one else worrying about the mini ice age?
What!! Your craZy.
2019?
Teleportation!!
Your narrative is nervously irritating.
That is what you think will happen you cant even product the weather I highly doubt people will use electric cars to good luck with that
Your future kids: Your cars were on the GROUND??? And: You had to clean your room yourself without robots?!?!
They are not saying how many animals will become extinct. And the air quality here on earth due to cutting down so many trees..
technology in the future is freaky
He forgot to mention 33% of you will be dead by then 2050
In 2050 im gonna be 45 lol
I want live in Mars to be are next planet after Earth disappears
It is 2019

I’m surprised they haven’t cured cancer
What is the source and courtesy of your forecasts?

*Who else is ready for the future*

I am glad I will not be alive for a lot of this.  Except the wrinkles. Oh, that's for rich people only. Don't like any of it.
I am watching this in 2019
Although everything will change but *humans* won't!
at least half of the stuff on this list are impossible and will never happen technology can't be integrated into the human body. Our bodies will reject such implants
he called the comet an astronaut
I predict all of you reading this will be dead by 2050
Who's watching this by 2019
2019
No global warming effects?
We need the Venus project
I don’t wanna live till then

Earth's mini-iceage is forcasted to begin soon I need the next few years so the icecaps will be getting larger and sea level will be dropping.
This doesn’t even have information about ww3

I’ll be alive then. I’ll be 38 in 2050. Excited about Mars.🥳 Also, I’m such a huge fan, Bright Side! NEVER STOP.
Yea but what about the illuminati's plan to enslave the human race and depopulate the planet for a more controllable population
Who else is here before 2050 ?

**coughs...** ANDROIDS ARE COMING HERE IN A FEW YEARS EHHEEHEHEHEEHE
I doubt we'll still be here in 2050, or it will be miserable. Like the film children of men or the road
It’s true that technology will destroy the world.
I would be 44 yrs old

i want my mind downloaded into a fully feeling and full sensored android or cyborg so I can live forever.
spaceballs ``beam me back scotty!'' LOL
Sweden already started to ban gas cars and slowly facing it out and people start buying electric cars
Well global warming is melting the artic ocean wish now ships csn go across in the summer and that was never possible. Also anartica is also melting and by 2050 we will be able to live there on the coast lines. We also are getting over populated and the earth is getting way dirtier we will be sending ppl to space or our species will be wiped out.
You don't even know if it will actually happen    But i hope the future is a virtual reality!
2035 ice age
aNyONe iN 2050??
I am 1000000000000000% sure no one will sub to me
*2019?* *hurry up and like I'm waiting*
Jesus I'll be 45 in 2050 I need to start living my life
Very interesting video!
One hand I don't like the future because crazy things might happen.... But I am starting to like it more and more.... I am now looking forward what's next! But I love the older thnings such as old tech..... they are cheap, and with a open mind of the days we live in now I can make old tech like new and even faster then we have now.... So, I like it both! Old + new = Power!
Did he say “astronaut colliding with the earth” 😂😂😂😂😂 7:10

Artificial madness

2:46 who thought the plane was going to crash into the jeddah like 9/11
In 2050 Jojo Siwa will be bald.
Starbucks sucks
7:11 "the probability of the Astronaut colliding with earth ....' 😂
I thought you would mention the downloading of human memory into a data.to save on a PC...
Well? It’s 2019 now
Im scared of the future. I just want to live in older times. Not like hundreds of years ago but i want everything to go back to the way it was in like the 70s or 80s
29 sucks
😔😕
Thats not if the overdue volcano erupts....    *we ded*
1000x faster WiFi dho..
I just hope we don’t get hit by that asteroid 😬
Here kitty (roar) lol
Actually, none!!!...........we don't even know if the world is going to end or not, if we try to be too superior god might get angry at us and that rock thingy (I forgot what its called, sorry) might just hit our planet.......I pray and hope that the earth doesn't end, and we live thought those future the scientists predicted and anyway didn't an evil robot is already been created and the robots thought of world domination so I'm not that excited about robots we can surely live without robots .........😢😢😢😢😢
2019?
Has boy happen in 2019
2019 anyone?
Ummmmmm.will i be dead if so yes. I like myself and my 🌎 i cant stand changes
But you guys know for real life the world will end in a billion years
i want real gundam before i died
2050 is 20-25 years after humans are extinct. You have to be very naive to think that we are doing fine with overpopulation, pollution, resource exploitation and climate change. "But Science and Technology will save us!!!". Yeah right, we don't even let science do its thing, only investing in economically viable projects that grant short term profits to corporate capitalism. Who are we kidding exactly?
Using wifi to charge Phone Huh.. that's very interesting as well as how interesting it's going to affect our bodies, that's a type of radiation. And for Wi-Fi to actually have enough amps to actually charge a device not to mention a device that's going to require a lot more power around that year. Also make know there's probably not going to be any cell phones just going to be something else either way,
If they are going to have non cage zoo's how does the population reach 8 billion people? Cuz I mean if u go to a non cage zoo it's game over
I like  when people get to go to Mars 2050
2050 = world war 3
Nope nothing happened yet, sorry
I'll be 57 years old by than
Who’s in 2019?
Where the melted water from Arctic goes though?
Well I won't be going in the army that's for sure
It's 2019 now
Living on mars would be pretty cool 😎
Yes
I see maybe. Just maybe a real moon landing .
Anyone from 2019?
Too late it already 2019 😎😎😎
im going for charging ur phone with wi-fi!!!!!!!1
2050 IS ONLY 30 YEARS AWAY LIKE BOI I WILL BE ONLY 40 SOTHE CHANCHES OF THAT HAPPENING ARE ABOUT 5%
THANK GOODNESS I WON'T BE ALIVE TO WITNESS SUPER OVERPOPULATION!!! I thought we were actually increasing it like really really fast but nothing to worry about now.
if they user wifi to charge they hackers will hack cars
Surprise surprise! IM FROM 2019! 😃 No nearly any of this is true.
Well all be feminist before 2050
I’m not ready for any of it
600 more million t series sub bots... the war is not over yet...
But what will happen in the year 2525? Will man survive? Will woman be alive? What will they find?
*Who else is here In 2021?*
I look forward to the end of:  Global warming. Wars. World hunger. Poverty. Racism Sexism. Terrorism. Corruption. Mental illness. Edit: Kim Jong Un.  I’m asking for a miracle, aren’t I?
2019. Uk has found a new way to find cancer early. But not all doctors can use it yet. Found it out on the news yesterday 2019. Uk will leave the e.u.
If they can’t even predict the weather why would the try and predict the future
Wait AM 15 in 2024!!! Am 9 now!

Im looking forward to Avengers Infinity War part 2 The End Game!!!
Some of this like the end of construction of buildings and stuff are very likely, but some stuff is just theories. I am most excited for the space hotel but I wonder if that all goes wrong?

Beautiful just beautiful
Minecraft would be da best game in 2050

I will be 43 in 2050
u dying sorry senpai it was my brain chip from the future :)
2019 IS IN 2 DAYS
IM COMING  FOR DAT TECHNOLOGY
How about Africa? Will we be advanced too or?
Genetic engineering on humans maybe detailed, because of a Chinese scientist international law violation.
Life is life  I think in 2050 we are able to travel the universe in a portal  just like Thanos .And also where are the new memes .
all of it i guess
I will just be happy when my children and grand children come home to visit!
I hope this is fake...
I just want the X1000 faster internet connection!!
What an annoying commentator. Why "get a life" for describing those who doubt the spoon fed obvious fall guy of Lee Harvey Oswald. Who was then killed by Jack Ruby. This obviously was part of much larger operation.  Most likely the fact JFK wanted the wealth of America back in the people's ownership . And not the elitist banking oligarchs like the Rothchilds.  It's been confirmed apparently on deathbed confessions .  The narrator is easily convinced and gullible.
omg its huge
I AM GOING TO BE ALIVE IN 2050 AND I WILL BE 40
electric cars are worse than gas cars
They won't be 9 billions of people's. . Look now, the birth is declining.. we won't be people. What people the gonna believe in.. God won't listing to the robot or crazy people that he didn't create. . 2050 I believe I can fly..
AI (Artificial Intelligence) will advance by leaps and bounds. We need to be super careful with this technology. It could have disastrous effects for humans.
Poop  Like if younagree
Looking forward for a Mars colony under one flag, the human race.
If i was NASA i would try to make giant ship and leave earth and try to find to new planet where to live because people have been hurting nature for to long  and threre is nothing to save anymore!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
Back to the future predicted there would be hover boards in 2015 yet there r nun
how about resolving the issue on "van-allen radiation belt" in 2030 :)
the soler power
I wonder what would happen by the year 3000
I’ll be 50 by then but question is will I live?
How he know all this omlll
2019 anyone?
Apophis
And how about     *CO2 emissions*
I've been waiting for the mini ice age
How many more years til 2050? someone please do math I don't want to do that mamomath. god bless.
Mars is already colonized
The video lost all credibility the moment the presenter insinuated that those who suspect LHO was not responsible for the JFK's assassination need to "get a life."
I look forward to the alpha centauri project, because its a planet there who could have life there, and think about if we finally find aliens.
Am scared....  am crying right now am really scared!!!!!!
When we can charge our phones with wifi
can you make a video about egypt 2050
Feeling old yet
:0
yeah all those more indian people whith enternet whill be scamming people
Humans will take ''You smell!'' as a death threat
I immediately though of Subnautica because of the space ship named Aurora that is going to mars in 2033
The mini ice age
I'm going to look for  the vidio "what will happen before 2018 ?" Let's see what should happen 😉
In the year 2054 baldness is cured
Whenever scientists predict all those stuff , they forget about economical and global warning , also wars that are going on in other countries and a lot of money being spend on that . Some of those might happen , but some are we will see how it will turn out . For example danger of light from the space that disturbs the technology , the problem is if that happens then the world will mess up really badly . Some might happen some might not because of economical condition of the world .
Well I won't be here
I worry a lot about this kind of stuff because it'll fail badly sometime after it's created. It seems like everybody in the future will be turned into computers.
Hmm hard to believe.. They can't even get the weather right...
A zombie outbreak will happen
what will happen in 999.9999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999 years
The thumbnail is so accurate. Mostly for the US !
The "wild card" to all of this is that we are already heading into a Grand Solar Minimum so food will become short by 2021.  Wars of huge magnitude will take place which will put the 3 or 4 most powerful superpowers in direct conflict.  Nuclear war is the most likely ending to these wars.  The world's population will be at 1/3rd what it is today or less.  All the advancement in technology will be put on hold because people will just be trying to live and exist instead of thriving.   Also, the return of Nibiru will be visible by 2025....  Mars will become the next astroid belt because of a Nibiru moon and Mars colliding...  I just wanted to give the opposing theory!!!
I look for wed to the brain implants
Yes as Muslims we know the future will be very corrupt than ever as all the signs of judgement has passed including tall building  shame on Saudi Arabia!
I was got shock in 2035. YOU SAYED RADIO WAVES AND ITHERS RESET MY MIND???!?!?!? WOW
I dont want my part of body becomes machine
2030s Eating fatty foods actually losing weight
Soon they will be a Starbucks next door to your house or Starbucks on wheels they coming in summer 2019 lol
Google working on making internet 1000 times faster? Isn't South Korea already doing that with their 10gb/s internet speed?
will fortnite still live??!?!!?!?
FAKE FAKE FAKE that’s all I’ve got to say
🤐😮
Hopefully the future has something good for us 🙏🏼
How about a new mass extincion?
Hi
I don’t know about some of those futures some I did like some I’m questioning it like paying something in my brain I don’t want that and even if I do want one I don’t know if I would be able to get one so yay I don’t know I question some of that kind of stuff and people I think you shouldn’t put stuff in your brain like chips and stuff like that because who knows what would happen like for instance someone can control you or something like that so no chip in my brain just think about that OK and have a merry Christmas byeee 🤨😕🤭❤️👍🐺
I will be 38 I think
I will be 57years old by 2050
The world could end? Before that could happen  And that could not happen?
My dad works at SPACE X
Is this al true?
In 2050 you will elect baron trump as your potus....
Ooo that’s next year
If we are fighting TODAY to save OUR planet, how will we do it with technology WE can’t understand! I don’t know but this is too scary, I wish WE SEE what we are doing to our world.
Well, I’m actually scared, because I can’t understan today’s technology like if I get the pieces of a smart phone, I wouldn’t understan how to fix it, so I feel useless in that times...
This is the future for rich people man
6:42 oh my god yes, I always dream about that kind of contact lenses, i want them sooo bad
We were supposed to have flying cars at this time. Instead we got trump 🤧
ARGH THE ASTEROID WHEN IM ALIVE??????

I'm looking forward to the mini ice age for the ice caps will form again
That is impossible

I've been taught the singularity will be in 2025. I learned it studying in computer information technology.
Don’t get wasted in the past or worry what will come but decide what your going to do now
10 years ago 2012 was suppose to be the end of the world .
There is a world where animals run wild...its called life lol

I looking forward to nothing because I getting older!
I hope people will invent a medicine that makes you immune to all viruses or bacteria sicknesses and diseases blindness hard of hearing it would be very useful
Do you now wherhouse
The other years are good
I feel that things in the coming years will get worse
who else is watching this in 2050?
You know a lot about the future...I'm amazed you know the exact year of teleportation.... clap-clap, no delay! =D
I most look forward to not going to Starbucks
7:11 he said astronaut while the words said asteroid
2:11 the elephant is peeing
You forget the 2029 second Great Depression.
Even back to the future said we would have flying cars in 2015 It's 2018 and still not out to the public
In 2019 Disney land will open Star Wars land

In 2050 Bright Side will have 50 million subscribers !
2020 lets get ready for subscribers

In 2021 I leave school and that’s all I care about
I think that you are lying about everything that was said in this video
If the ice meltes in the Atlanic ocean would that do something to the titanic???
buhay pa ba si cardo sa 2050?
Why would an astronaut collide with earth
I just want to go to mars but I don't have enogh money
HALF OF THESE THINGS ARENT EVEN GOING TO HAPPEN
7:12 astronaut
Hope to get to the new future technology
dont forget WWW3, WWW4, WWW5, WWW6 AND A NUCLEAR WAR THEN THE END OF THE WORLD LOL
I look forward to the mars event
"google will invest enough money to make the internet 1,000 time faster" Can't wait
‘All still lined up at Starbucks ‘ lol
But they can’t even tell the weather they definitely can’t tell the future
Dude!! You gotta be dumber than North Koreans their is already wifi charging
He only thing I’m excited for is better wifi
MMAAAAAAARS
I’m looking forward to that astroid
it isn't true
No thank you no teslas for me!
Look forward to evolving beyond current college system with all selective class/teacher and all online. Won’t cost as much and with advanced tech classes tailored to each person and learn from home. This will happen and classical colleges will become the minority. Sounds like a good plans to invest some $
I dont velive it
Hearing and seeing !!! I’ll be 67 !!
All of them I really look forward too other than the tragic events that will happen in the same years. Them making this technology is just predicting for the future to occur next year.
Reaching 9 billion people all lined up at Starbucks
What about the animals, nature and pollution ????? D:
I hope this is fake 😢
This is all just a prediction do not believe in it
At this rate we'll be making clones of our selves
Only thing i cared about is a true virtual reality world similar to the matrix. Being able to create your own world or life in your fantasy game. (so yea this video was a bore as it didn't mention what i want to see)
I'm looking forward to when they can cure deafness. My mum has Ménière's disease, and the treatment for it would result in her losing her hearing, so once it can be restored she can be healthy again!
2050 is when I'm 99
i can't believe i am going to live through all of this
Looking forward to be able to buy a new car, even if it's electric... :)
Still no cure for baldness 😁
That is not what the future will look like, or be like. Amun Ra!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The JFK files have already been declassified.
but i hope it does!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!noooooooob
i predict President Trump will be RE-ELECTED in 2020.
i hope that hookers will be available at the space hotel -- it gets pretty cold in space
this video left out Iran getting NUKES and killing all of us
ohhhh... bright side have fU*#@%$ time machine..
I’m scared 😟
and the pollution levels created by 8B ppl ???  = the end
I don't think any of these will ever happen unless people like me don't born!! 🤔😪😂😂
Am I the only person that caught the narrator say,  (7:12) “probability of the Astronaut hitting the earth”. He meant to say asteroid hitting the earth. Lol
You didnt mention alien arrivals???
Robotic body enhancements is what I'm waiting for
You guys know anything can happen and these are predictions
If all else fails,     *hit or miss*
This seems interesting       Nvm
At 7:15 did anyone else notice they said astronaut instead of asteroid
A few things stand out to me as not probable:  1.  Not many will willingly allow implants into their brains.  2.  Not many will volunteer to go to Mars.  Why would they?  3.  Driver-less cars won't become commonplace - too many accidents will occur, and most people like to be in control.  4. Scientists may be able to keep bodies alive longer, but they have no technology to deal with the human spirit - that entity that we are.  Referring back to number 1, messing with the human brain will only wreak havoc on a person.  Finally,  the problems associated with a 9 billion person population will overwhelm our planet...and be more than science can handle.  So we have some real challenges ahead of us. Sorry guys.
Hahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahaha
...
I
... do u rlly need a robot go to a bar
you forgot to mention that I will turn 47 years old....
4:47 The only thing I'm looking forward to.
When will they make plant based meat that tastes like real meat?
and all that happens but eventually humans themselves go extinct. bye bye. although, we're all fools, because each new life is yourself. the great self playing hide and seek. hilarious
I think er, we should do more riddles . How do you know the future?
Lol I bet he made all those Starbucks jokes because he waited a long time for a Coffe.
Lol Starbucks be prepared.
This video just worries me
The year 2050 I’ll be turning 51
My favorite was internet charging your devices
You forgot to mention that China would be the most powerful country in the world. And that we all would be speaking Chinese?
Phones will get Smarter and Humans will get Dumber.
im im afraid for my life cuase of the astroid
Oh no
technology will crash way b4 most of this stuff happens. we'll end up like book of eli
I was hoping for less cars,more nature,NO POLLUTION and no astroids
This could be possible if World war 3 does not occur
At 2050 I Will Be 30 Years Old
Here is my 2 cents and it should be taken as a grain of salt. First of all I'll like to say all of this is not until 2050 it's actually happing right now today and it's not for the next door neighbor or for the regular guy walking down the block. One things for sure is that all of this is very demonic, say goodbye to the feel and touch of a woman or a man and having babies as you know it. So we will be talking robotics and transhumanism? No human feelings at all? Need I say anymore? Another thing to the ones that are proud and happy for what is coming, good luck if you will be part of that club. Flying cars maybe out there but guess what can you buy it and fly around? I don't so. And as for Mars and space they said it will be adorable? Really while the machines are talking away the jobs so who will be working to make money? Will money even be around or as we know it? The human population already have a problem staying alive. Ok so most of our food will be GMO so that means our DNA will also have to adapt to that as well. I can go on and on but I think you people get my point and where I'm going with all of this. Most people that is here today will not even be around by that time. So with all this that's going on all I have to say is that the aliens that so many people say do not exist guess what? We are the aliens, the super smart ones are the ones that is changing the human race to point them in another direction to destroy what we know today. It will only serve the powers that be. In a few years from I'll see you guys coming back to the comments. Let's hope I'm wrong and they are right, that it will be good for of humanity. Good luck guys. Oh and another last question who's going be paying for all of this? it ain't for free that's for sure.
This is scaring me...
Did anyone else hear him say astronaut instead of asteroid at 7:12??
hi from the future it's 2030 here and some of these did not happen rotflol
The science thing I'm most excited for is fully automatic cars. Next year? I've heard that it'll be some decades before cars can me fully automatic on the road. Denmark probably won't be the first country to have them, I guess. It's possible that I won't get to use a car on my own before they become fully automatic.
I want help I need to see what my future is like please bright side
7:12 the astronaut may collide with the earth lol
I'll be 41 by then😐
I'll be 45 in 2050
And in the year 3000 they’ll live underwater!
Hey only can god can knowthe earth ends
are you a scientist or something
Woah..I just wanna live in a country side and have a horse ..
I hope that i'm alive and in excellent condition for home super computers and the super internet.  And I also want the contact lenses with internet access and the tiny cameras in them.  I hope that there is also quantum teleportation and biological 3-D printing of organs, and I hope that there are space colonies, moon colonies, and Mars colonies.  I think that sometime in the future, someone will invent A practical fire arms safety device that will be built right into fire arms and while it keeps children from operating fire arms it will so easy to use that adults won't have any trouble at all making their fire arms work right when they are needed.
I don't even care, I just want my youth will reamain the same *simple and chill*
I will be 30!
How do u know there future
The world is changing so quick and so fast 🍼☕️

Hope I see it all.
I'm more scared than excited tbh
With the whole life expectancies thing. Would that apply to everyone or just people who are born after that time period?
This is so fake
I can't wait in till everybody is lined up at Starbucks
The world will end.
0:30 Ellipsism, I saw the video on the emotions you can’t name!
Just gotta say, wow.
Manny people are happy with how far we are with technology while I’m here only thinking about the well-being of the nature and animals
U sound like my grandpa
2050 will be the same as 2018 as long as the democratic party doesn't destroy the country
How do you know everything?
I’m bare scared
Lions will probably be extinct by 2050
But when will flying hover cars be, or robot maids that you can name Rosie?
Sometimes i dream that Something is going to happens sometimes

One thing he forgot to mention is how memes will evolve...
2022 Third World War
Such a pity that we all will be too old in those enthralling times. If only I'll be born in 2030.

2019:artical 13
Electric cars are good cause animals like Polar bears and otters, they'll become Extinct .  And global warming is cause of gas 2. So I think that's the only good one to me
Nice knowing you all
Our future looks doomed
2074:  the first icar is released
Life is yo mama

Do you play Fortnite?
Every thing
When will the planet do something better than use toilet paper to wipe our butts?
Verbal typo at 7:12, using the word "astronaut" instead of "asteroid"  :)
God will not approve with all that sin
please tell me wat will happen to my home africa.....please

#ICEAGE
it might be true and it might be not true
Oh greattt.. the technology is taking the world than human
I’ll be like 43 in 2050 so I’ll see what happens and if any of it does happen I’ll comment about it if YouTube is still alive by then
I think Pokemon will even advanced and Ash will be 11!!😂😂
Watch most of these stuff not happen
Im scared about the astroid
Well the part I'm not looking forward to is all that stuff about Brain plants and stuff the part I do like is Mars colonization

seriously guys this is scary. Humans are destroying earth
2:47 JEDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH I LIVE IN JEDDDAHHHHHHHH WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
you left out world war three
Which solor company should I buy stock in?  Any ideas?
Banning gas cars? That just can't happen, the gas industry is too strong. And anyways I don't like electric cars, there's no sound, no fun, you have to install a thing to charge it which cost 10k more. Lucky I don't live in Norway, for us car guys we don't enjoy electric cars, they are just too boring. The only 'cool' cars are Teslas and they cost 60k+ so...
who knows whats gonna happen? my advice is that u enjoy life right before it flashes before your eyes.
my imagination is that if we go extinct,cocroaches will evolve like us like furry cocroaches.if not,chickens,rhinos,and polar bears will go extinct.and the fact that it will be so clean because weve been worrying about pollution for so long.we probably wouldve solved it.maybe robots will take over and we'll turn out like the people in War Of The Worlds.
everyone!!prepare tobots will take over
"People's life expectancy will get longer..."  Meanwhile, the life expectancy in the USA has dropped for the last 3 consecutive years. :(
I’m not looking forward to it this sounds horrible
I think the world will end in one day..only god knows   Can I get a like? Thanks for 15 likes
Upgraded economy is just for rich people..  They didn't even think that earth still has big population of poor humanity ..what shown in here are buildings and cars good for entrepreneurs and business man's future earnings 😂😂..  Hoping to show the other side of earth 😔 I don't even know why churches has to be so elegant when the purpose is to serve God even just in our little ways..
Will there be a electric inplant in the brain to make people smarter, and how people who have a hard time hearing or cannot hear at all.
WAIT DID YOU JUST SWID THAT JOHN F.K. WA D GONNA BE ALIVE some answers pls i don't get that he died along time ago
4:52 Spartans are gonna be real baby!!
People:World War III is going to break out in 2018        PewDiePie vs T-series war starts People:we were right for once with our prediction!
Im not looking forward to seeing any of these
Where is your list of references to sources for most of this video?
Honny? Let's get to Mars 💎✨
The bionic eye lens 😁
Dude i know that gas cars is not going to get banned so you are a       Lier
So, in 2020 T-series will be the #1 YouTuber?  😂💔
I am looking forward to lots of space things just expanding our world like the colonisation of mars will be great but I will probably stay here because how will you grow trees and if they do I can’t imagine it looking good all this red dust everywhere even tho that’s kinda already for me cause I live in Australia  Edit: most of Australia isn’t red dust
Bruh, imagine how EXPENSIVE those flying cars would be if they were made though.
i think stuff will happen sooner then expected because people are going to be smarter then they are now...  just my theory...
Ha, landed a spaceship on Mars 2018
omg nooooo T-T when i was younger, i dreamed of experiencing living with robots and teleporting to places and going to different planets...everything futuristic..... and now i grown up abit , your telling me i wont be able to go to mars until im 50?! no one told me that time passes by so fast as an adult D:
This random but i was eating an orange and choked on that white stuff
This might be 0.001% correct. Humanity is not so great at predicting new technology. Take a look at the videos "what the future will be like In 2000"
Alians we'll get out of hiding
The space Hotel is possibly , there is already a apartment(or hotel) underwater
I remember watching the tomorrows world series stating what would happen, 30 years in the future in the year 2000. When you look back at those programs now, they get somethings fairly accurate, but soo much is completely wrong.
When will we find out who jack the ripper is
5:01  i saw a video ... isn't this the disney park they cancelled? So it's NOT cancelled? Noice.
Polar ice caps disappearing is scary
I love this vid tho
Wrong it landed on Mars in November 2018
U can’t predict the future u can’t predict past ur time you can’t even predict tommorow I don’t care who u t
The Apple store will release IPhone XL
Mars colonolisation is what I'm looking forward to.
You kinda sound like Life Noggin'
In 2025... the building of nuketown is complete.
He said astronaut instead of asteroid
I wanted to know how many Sharknado movies they were gonna make.

You,me,people are destroying the earth 🌎

In 2030 Indonesia no longer exist,  *Wowo quote* 😂
I’m looking forward to the space teleportation
most of this is untrue and/or very unspecific

Bright side is joking 🙃

7:11 "the probability of the ASTRONAUT colliding with earth is 2029 was only 2.7%" lol Neil's been busy
Looking forward to the colonization of mars, but highly disagree of chip implants
“Let’s start in 2019. Oooooo, that’s next year”
I like the brain enhancing theory. I could finally cure my Bipolar Disorder.
Reasons why the world should end or we have to suffer in future

When will Andrew Ryan build the underwater city Rapture, and the ability to shoot fire, ice, electricity, and hornets from my hands? When can I be put into a deep sea diving suit with a drill for a hand? I need to know!
ughhh I’m so scared of the asteroid...
Nuclear war and devastation with China and/or Russia as belligerents seems far more likely than a technocratic utopia.
In2050 we might not be alive 😢 😢 😢 😢

Roses are red Violets are blue I came for the thumbnail  And so did you
Yes self controlling cars! I wont have to drive cars on my own when i learn to!
This video totally ignores the impact of climate change and how natural disasters will actually stop most of those things from happening.
Wen I here that in 2025 we can charge electronics with WiFi I am running around the hole house
I'm ready for it 2027
2.56 so t series will win huh :(
2050 , 50% of people will suffer from short-sightedness ? But before that people will be able to have bionic eyes . So the bionic eyes will have one fault , it can't improve short-sightedness. Lol
No in 2050 t-series will take over
All
The internet speed beefed up 100 times sounds like a good deal
The future is terrifying...I feel late 1900's was the best time...limited technology and more peacefulness...
I cry just because I don’t live in Saudi Arabia 🇸🇦
I love Saudi Arabia 🇸🇦
I WANNA live in mars but maybe by then im too old to even move
Wow if this video wasn’t extremely telling......
U forget the 2020 Olympic Games
Squirrels are going to be in control
Feminists would rule the world
So is eart really going to get hit by an asteroid
I'm scared of the asteroid
whites will be a minority in Europe and North America
11:30  stop trying to give me nightmares
7:07   Was this some kind of subliminal message telling us aliens will arrive?
I hope I can still play roblox
Nature is getting rejected         Like if you agree with me   please
I imagine in 2050 that there will be Chickenosauruses running around everywhere
I want to live forever!
My iPad is 2025

i'm happy he didn't say anything about time machines because i would say there can't be time machines because we would see time travelers unless invisible suits were made though the time machine would show.

I LOVE INDIA LIVE IN IT AND TALK HINDI AND CELEBRATE DIWALI AND HOLI and born in India lol
I'm starting to wonder if there are infinite timelines, and perhaps some of these discoveries were already discovered in other timelines.
The gene modification to live a longer life sounds like the coolest idea, but also gives mixed feelings.
Finnaly IPhone XXXXXs Mega
The fact that shocked me the most was the fact there weren't any projects to save the world from global warming and the food shortages that keep growing because of overpopulation.
Singularity in 2045?  Makes me terrified, but also I wan't to see what happens.
No deathness sounds pretty cool
IS IT GONNA HAPPEN????!!!!!!!!!!

U accidentally said astronaut instead of asteroid
3:03 we'll at least we have more phones wait until we have to walk our dogs 🐶
Internet 1000× faster google gonna ban buffering that circling thing
When I scared of “The end of the World”, I can watch this video and relax  (Examples: the world end in 2021 > less people, population will reach 8 billion in 2025 > nothing, so the end of the world is fake)
If all change one thing will not change is poverty rich will be rich poor will be poor
What’s gonna happen to the world of it had 9 billion people
I don’t want to live in the future 🤥🙁
I wonder how many grand kids i will have 😂 i'd say like...... For generations property..... 900? Or 1000? 😂
I happy if faster internet xD
The future is scary...
Short sightness
True or not answer, true or not what will you choose
All
should i even look forward to any of those? ._. i mean india is poor.. i don't really think i'll find such stuffs in a market or anything..  Guess such advances wont be actually affecting lives of a few peeps.. Yet "Civilization on Mars" quite fascinates me.. but then again regular peeps can't be a part of such programmes anyways ●~● So basically... im not looking forward to any of these
Chappie for president !/Year 2045\!
guys dont worrie humans will pultute and ruin earth before any of this happens we will be the end of earth if people dont chane
What about time travel.according to people who have come from the future they clainm it started in 2028.

NOOOO!!! THIS IS FCKING SCARY😭🙏
I look fortward to the future where there is s Big nukeclear war going on 👍
Bright side the only thing promised in life is death and birth
You forgot to mention that by the year 2028, we’ll see WW III due to change in the ranking positions of worlds super powers.
I will be 46 years old in 2050

If I’m a kid right now will I exprince this?
I WILL BE DEAD NEXT YEAR IM OMLY 11
I want a real answer for this guys, how bad will the mini ice age be? Because i'm much more curious about that.
Robot will take overrr
Who else was sitting there calculating how old they'd be each year :P
I’m looking forwards to waiting in line for Starbucks
You said the years that I will be 20 and 30
I'm moving to mars
Your caption is totally irrelevant to movie stuff and it wasted my 12 minutes
I hope whoever makes robots will think twice before making them
In 2050 im 43 yrs old :o
Stephan hawkins said that there will be to many people if it continues to grow at this rate and i think it is true
If you have a Robot Wife and you split up, Will a Judge still give her half of your assets?
these kind of videos freak me out
I'll be 45 or dead by then
Hopefully the jeddah tower doesn't suffer any earthquakes
Russia please share the teleportation… I NEED IT RUSSIA NEED! IVE BEEN WALKING FOR SO LONG THAT MY LEGS ARE GOING TO GROW ABS!
Life expectancy has fallen gradually since the early days n will continue to fall no matter what...
Idk I’m kinda excited to see what will happen when people try to live on Mars. Other than that the future sounds kinda horrible
life expectancy and brain improvements sound too good to be true
I will be 43 in 2050
Then what is gonna happen when the astriod
I’ll be dead.
1988: i bet there would be flying cars  in 2018 2018:Baby SHARK DOO DOO DOO DOO DOO also 2018: there will be space hotels in the future Future:Hey guys welcome back to Another video and in this video ill be having *** with robots!
So still No Time machine ? If they build i would go back in 1990-2010 best years ( moderate technology with beautiful nature )
I was checking how old i would everytime he said 20this 20that
I know the future it's no different  than what' it is like today and there is no flying cars people aren't smart enough to figure out gravity versus laws of physics more diseases and still no cure for AIDS and nuclear war could happen by NORTH KOREA humans living it 5rye j kiki hu it ķ/ n.vgreee
2:43 who thought of 9/11 scenario?? :O
If that's true, I'm a little afraid
By 2050 I will be 44 years of age😉
I'm looking forward for one you didn't mention,  and that's 🌐🔗 #blockchain #technology #XRP
Ill be 43 in 2050
Stop! I want to get off! 😩
before 2050 subsaharran Africa  would have become one country
i wish a decrease in technology and increase in humanity. does anyone else feels it?
there is actually a lot of smugness in this video. and most of the "events" are totally arbitrary predictions.
no space battleships, laser and plasma guns, mecha and power armor?  :/
WHY WOULD THEY BE INCREASING REACTION TIME FOR SOLDIERS
I dont get the what u mean with all lined up at Starbucks
wait. A mission to centari will take 20 years? I bet you that their going to fail that mission 65.5 percent.
They need to quick putting this stuff up it's scary people
1 out of 2 people will have autism
I would look forward to the fact that 2038 will have a cure for my deafness
You know, in the 60's people thought we'd have a golden nuclear age, self-flying cars and droid butlers.  I remain skeptic any of these will happen 🤔
I like how I can charge my computer without a charger :)))))
The average American adult  will be 250lbs, the average American child will be 196lbs, Mexico will be a state, Melania Trump will be the first female US president & the first man will be lil pump.
Future basically like it is now or worse
Asteroid in 2027
Why not make mission to Mars earlier?
I will bet you 18 cents.Humans will be the same then as they were in 1950.Next intelligent question.
I feel like you can’t predict that far ahead. I’m sure if you told someone 32 years ago you’ll be able to watch 2 girls get it on, on a 5inch screen. They’ll think you’re crazy lol
This was published on my birthday, ahh nice.
great guess
2099
I think there might not even be a world because of pollutoin and deforestation
I think that if humanity survives through 2500 it will continue because we have learned how to keep nature alive
2019 2020 2021 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 2035 2036 2037 2038 2039 2040 2041 2042 2043 2044 2045 2046 2047 2048 2049 2050 2051 2052 2053 2054 2055 2056 2057 2058 2059 2060 2061 2062 2063 2064 2065 2066 2067 2068 2069 2070 2071 2072 2073 2074 2075 2076 2077 2078 2079 2080 2081 2082 2083 2084 2085 2086 2087 2088 2089 2090 2091 2092 2093 2094 2095 2096 2097 2098 2099 3000
I do know i will be 55 years old currently 23
Am I the only one who think this is scary ? The world will look so different in less than 40 years
time travel
But somehow we can't accurately predict next weeks weather.😏
When I was 7years old it was too good.simple life with telephones,no internet,playing cricket in hot days,roaming in the jungles ,extensive simplicity .I feel much better.
will we have time for ourself
U forgot the tesla roadster 2.0 will be realesed in 2020
My Crystal ball🤣🤣🤣

Things I want to HAPPEN 1.when are toys r us coming 2.humans should live forever 3. Nothing will destroy earth 4.let it not be too soar to be pregnant  5.let the homeless people to get rich  6.let other shops be lesser bc people are losing money
I love it
ooo thats next year
Now the 1000x Internet Faster is what im expecting and if its not true expect me to comeback in this channel..
And i think about BTS thats gonna end in 7 years
you forget to mention about world war 3 killing billions of humans animals
In 2050 I will be 42 😤
I think in 2050 half of the world will be killed by thanos...
Doubt.
wait we’re moving to mars?!?
Where are Cryptocurrencies? cough* cough*
We already are 8bill tho
We will experience a mini ice age also the ice will completely melt ????????
Starbucks?  Need to buy some shares now :)
Bright side i just want to know of ur a muslim
This facts makes me wanna just stop living right now.
Ill be 46
I hope there's toilets in mars
Will bright side still do YouTube in 2050?
im danish
Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino?
You never know. Maybe some of these are true
I don’t want The astriod to hit earth
I hope there will has a big city in the ocean
Dont tell anyone to get a life
The expectation of future technology is fun if it is for human goodness. Many good ideas and planning have been made by scientists. But will it be achieved?   CURRENT political factors may be chronic in 2030 or earlier. The war in the Middle East led to the formation of new proxies, the 3rd World War. Is there human after 2030? Or only a handful of survivors, with total destruction of technology. Does man live in underground sewerage due to air and radioactive pollution? The current political factors of the world will greatly affect future fate.
2050 America will still be at war. Aliens might need democracy.
Anything like VR games Sword Art Online style?
It sounds scary but fun (flying cars...)
How about the poor countries? Are they still going to remain poor
Charging my phone using wifi 🤗
BRIGHT SIDE How do u guys know all if this?🤔
Who is from Denmark
ice age why when i'm gonna be 25 :*(
Mini Ice age would be good
The downfall of the post modern era.
All of this generation is going to turn into old heads not wanting a lot of this futuristic technology think about that
Dammm idk if I would be still alive
2035
Mars...
first person on mars
which is over a full kilometer!!
Nice to know that in the next 32 years birth control won”t improve at all.
In the future we will develop better technology but however we will find it normal but this days youth(me) will see this as to much but then it will be normal to see a 5 year old with some crazy tech but we will live longer this will result in over popultion  and god knows what would happen after.
I would like to see the people of Earth on Mars. But I think it would very impossible to survive on Earth without ocean and lakes and rivers. So what, we're gonna bring 50 billion gallons of water to Mars to drink. That would take decades!
I wish they put supporting information in the description to actually prove their research does exist and not just made up bluffs. It's really suspicious when you just say stuff and not put a source to support your 'facts'.
I live in dubai
I cant wait for the space hotel!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Mars one launches in 2026
What about finding the cure for cancer???
Sucks that I’m gonna be over 50 y/o in 2050😂😭
I’ll probably be dead by then anyway
Wow they did not mention that is 2028 time travel will be available. Ya know, I am saying this because that is where I am from.
I don't know if this is a positive thing or negative
IM LOOKING FOR THE SMARTPHONE THINGS
Amazing.
One thing i know, i would not be anymore before 2050
Scientists have concluded in a worldwide multibillion dollar study that a human whom goes to bed with an itchy bum, will in fact! wake up with a stinky finger! #mindblown 👉👃🤢💩
Driverless cars yay
Uhhh howd u see the future your not god
Well guess whose not gonna have babies. If I want to in the future, I will come back to this video
I’ve seen in some tv programs that our technology are getting more and more advance and even the  dead people frozen brain will be having new mettalic body
rapture will take place very soon. hahaha be ready
Can't wait to see some of these things!!
Jeez, why do people ask for likes so much?  *Life if you agree*
Lol he said astronaut instead of asteroid at 7:07
huh, the future actually looks peaceful.
In 2025 t series will take over
Ice age
My favourite year was 2050
My God will come again here on earth😇😇
Jesus ill be 58 years old by 2050... not looking forward to this.

Ban on combustion engine cars? I dont want to live on this planet anymore when that happens
Before 2050. Let me just kick the bucket.  I’m gonna be frighting about animals walking the board walk freely.  Without cages.  Owners.   I will be 77 yrs old. In 2050.   40 yrs old in 2020.    Dam
.

How about we send people to Phobias & Deimos.
How do you know this

I am going to be an engineer so i was going to make time travel and teleportation
I love the event is happening in 2050

Colonization on mars 2050
everybody would look so much prettier and better
I'm scared
Did you now this! 2222 year Dubai gonna the new tower in Dubai
I'm from Norway, We will NOT ban Gas/diesel cars by 2025! Electric cars are predicted to be less popular as they will be required to pay for the toll roads as everybody else, also our main income is from the oil industry!!
I hope that when i move to Germany, fortnite and PUBG will still be popular and i get to play them.
Going to mars is what I'm most excited about
Electricity is our greatest discovery and we’ve scratched the surface of its potential.
I'm also blind in one eye so when those robotic eyes are commercialised I'll  be first in line
"2038, the world population will reach 9 billion people"...and all animals will be extinct
hey I well be living in all of those times and I well be 40 years old when it is 2050
All of them except the overpopulation. We are already tooo many!!!!
I WANT TO LIVE IN MARS!
I hope vw buses wont become obstelete
Will water be free? It should And most food Think of the poor people please everyone 🙂
I hope that they figure out how to cure MS and other brain diseases. It will probably be too late for me but at least the future women and men in my family will be saved which will make me very happy 😊
Asia as a center of air traffic? How?
Surprised that there was nothing about brexit..
People's life expectancy will increase starting by the year 2025? Ha. Thats funny. Not from North America.
2038--they should release true information about the 'moon landings' by us and the USSR(at the time). It all was for a purpose at the time but let's head to the moon again as it will bring hope for all!  Don't think for a second the 'Mars' scenario doesn't involve our moon as well. I mean they didn't even have laptops then but could land on the moon 🌙???😒😒
God knows how you figured out that the mystery related to John F kennedy's death will be solved by that time.
None cause I’ll be to old to experience any of them thangs
You forgot to mension that the extra 2billion increase in human population will be female... men will diminish where women will increase rapidly ... ratio of male and female will be === 1:50 respectively 🤓

Over population, mass inequality, scarce resources to name a few.

Great a horrible future awaits.
I'll be sixty by 2050 so yea yay
2:02 he wistled by accident XDDDDDD
The beginning sounded like the theme song of That 70's Show
You can’t even come close to predicting the future it’s impossible even if there is facts and support
Ill be 40 something im too lazy to count what exaclty.

2020 call of duty movie

I don't think that there will be earth in 2050 but its nice that we know what can happen in 2050
I hope this won t happen. I hope every thing will be natural and nothing like robots. I ask sometimes my self what I want to be in the future, I actually wanted to be an astronaut but  now I just want to have a lot of money but not to use it for the electronic stuff but naturel things.
When you realize that you will not be able to witness any of these.....
When you realize that you will not be able to witness any of these.....
I'm scared of overpopulation because the earth is estimated to become full at 11-12 people. Hey I'm the same guy that's 8 and has a mental age of 48.
Hey guys guess what I'm only 8 years old and I have a mental age of 48
Erm. I believe you wanted to convey “decrease in reaction time” instead of “increase in reaction time” when you mentioned electricity being used to stimulate soldiers
Brightside are you OK
Stop making people scared
Sorry unless we stop burning coal, oil and natural gas our environment will become extremely hot. More drought world wide and more flooding due to melted ice caps. This stuff  you showed looks great hopefully we will see some of it.

My question is why can't some of those technological advances happen now? If we know they're coming that means the knowledge is already there. So why wait?

Plutocracy will overcome democracy. Pollution will reach uncontrollable level and the luxury you talked about will be confine to the rich and wealthy. While the condition of the poor will be miserable. This is my prediction.
Dated:2018 , If any people after 2050 see it, like my comment.I WILL BE DEAD BY THAT TIME.
Mars don't have magnetic field. Then, how how we will be stay there?

Douglass Adams (Hitchhikers' Guide to the Galaxy) wrote a sci-fi comedy novel I think is  titled, "Spaceship Titanic". 🚀

Mama mo iniyot ko 10000 years ago

https://youtu.be/i8vfa0LSwDI
Lol, you sound like Caillou's dad
I am a traveller from the year 252525. The backwards time machine still hasn't arrived. In all the world there's only one technology: a rusty sword for practicing procotolgy.
In 2050 McDonald’s ice cream machine is still broken!

You're way off. You forgot to mention the effects of Harmonic Convergence that happened in 1987.  Our closest sun, 4.25 light years away from was just struck by it in July 2018. Run the numbers. It will hit us around 4 years from now.
He said Astronaut instead of Asteroid
This Doggy  🏋️‍♀️ She gets 5$ for each like she gets

Just cuz you're saying this s*** in a Elvis voice doesn't mean nothing.  All this s*** is not facts
And in 2050 McDonald's dollar menu will consist of condiments for hamburgers.
I predict a new disaster movie-Global Warming meets Mini Ice Age-in which everybody goes insane.
Clickbait Will be Even Even More Common. That what Will happen at 2050
The astronaught
only for rich and healthy
i wonder what will happen to FORTNITE?!
I am slightly exited cause it sounds cool but global warming, plastic pollution, deforestation and things will still exist. Honestly I think humanity is destroying this beautiful world, why don’t people care as much as I do
I'm looking forward to either the rapture or armeggedon.
The future will eventually reach the past :) Some things we can change and some will stay the same. Inner peace, love, respect for all life forms will perhaps only change in their manifestation...... We have to go forward, but never forget where we started off from....
Over 50% of people already suffer from short sightedness. Nearsightedness is something altogether different.
What Happens If None Of This...Happens...?   Also, Will Animal's With Short Lifespans Have Longer Lifespans In 2050...?          ( Just Asking )

What about achieving immorality?
Like if you love yourself
Woah woah woah WAIT!  That thumbnail is sexist

My idea is that in the year of 2030 if we don't stop polluting and stuff every single thing on earth shall perish because global warming mostly because of most adults.

Life is not going to end on earth
Is this all true because I do not think life is going to end on earth
I don't like what's gonna be in the future
I just heard we only got till 2030
In 2025 life expectancy will decrease in America, because we still won't have affordable healthcare.
7:11 does that mean it IS colliding with earth or NOT
How about the cure for blindness?

What about down loading your brain in a new body with all the same thoughts, memories essentially you in a fully functional brand new adult I seen this in Las Vegas at a convention. And the person that I touched in the bag was a real person. Dormant with with some tubes going in to  him. When is that going to happen?
Tesla hit 500k Cars
i dreamed once about me of how i died then my best friend and then my aunt
I was born in 2016 I am 4 years old
All I wanna know is how long the lifespan of dank memes will be in 2050
teleportation
HA! In your face Mrs. Rey!(HS guidance counselor) I guess focusing on girls & partying did payoff because it kept me from my dream of being an astronaut & according to the 7:12 mark of this vid, an astronaut may collide with earth in 2029..so 👅
I kinda wish I was like 50 so I would know what the old days were like I hat3 how we always use technology 😐

I can’t wait to charge my phone using WI-FI!!
Allah knows best about before and after our life
Soooo wont 2019 be a great year?
It would be naieve to assume AI would be there to serve humanity. It will become the dominant species on this earth. It will start by learning human traits just like babies do. I will have self conciousness, it wants to survive, it will know fear and it will use violence as a perceived security against its fears. AI will destroy humanity. If we don't act now, it will happen faster than you think.
How about the rich getting much richer and powerful. 80% of humanity doesn't matter anymore and is left to fight for the crumbs.
How about AI taking over control of earth, within 5 years?
3131lol
In the year 2035, there will be 200 million starbucks stores
Stop aging
*Battle royale*

Why 2018 have the most dumbest music?
Say what
2020(hopefully)safe version of an actual VR sword art online game will be released the following 2022 they will release gun gale online  then 2036 is when everyone will be wearing VR gear and go on to there normal everyday thing as well as seeing everything as a video game
7:11 Will an 'astronaut' really collide with the Earth and deal that much damage?
WHERE IS BITCOIN?
Me, fortnite dying
I think in the future, most of the people is bad
Sorry but friends don't let friends to drink Starbucks !

Oh, what a day to be alive.
Ill be 31 in 2041
I don’t want this to happen I want the world to stay the same or just to make some changes but not this. Cause I’m only 7 and I was born in 2011. Like if you don’t want any of this to happen :(
I  predict in the future that i could play basketball later afternoon
But will we every find out what's tasty in Busan?
All of them because I was born in 2006 so I’ll be like 30 or 40 years old someone do the math for me please I’m too lazy thank you

I'm excited for Google to make the internet much faster
Half these things sound like science fiction
what do i look forward to by 2050 I don't know  I  maybe already in heaven by that time.  or close to it   since I'm 50 right now.
sucks to think because of my age i probably won't get to see Mars
And how can you confidently predict all this??
If trump stays president none of this will happened and the world will be destroyed
No after burn khaki father there will be Alalam mall which will be 😴 Did not listen to the teacher, still alalam mall will win

In 2026 dubai will finish the world tallest building named BURG KOAR
Can the brain implant cure my depression
i m afraid no technology to protect us from asteroids. we certainly need it. otherwise like dinasaurs.....................................
for that population, other planet colonisation is the only option. limited resources.   but wat d fuq is that asteroid planning, i m scared if its bringing new advanced species on earth, obviously then a tata bye bye for us
none! i'm waiting for aliens
Reallifelores videos was better and more accurate
When in the future I’m one of the 2050 by then
In 2050 i think    MAN KIND WILL DISCOVER UNICORNS
BRIGHT SIDE Will stop clickbaiting.
I will look forward to pretty much none of these except the Kennedy files in 38’
We’ll see
oof over population here we come
This also scares me what if 99.999999 percent of the earts population will be a robot , id rather live like in the 2010s because if in the future there are no schools then life woul be as boring as walking around in circles
So i hope there will be no more lamborginis and buggatis instead racers could just use the tesla roadster eclectric racing car
I also hope that nobody would get superpowers because there will probably be chaos everywhere
To me being my natural self is better than being my technological self
Because if everyone is already like a god then there are no more things to do
Living in a world with mother nature is still better than living in a technological world no matter what
We still don't get it what happen in 2050
Yay!more continues!I'm so happy!
Idk the movie 'Split Second"(1992)comes to mind when I think of a flooded Venice.
Some things are good, some things are horrible, many things won’t happen, the greedy people won’t part with their money. And it takes money to advance civilization in a positive way.
2029 so scary
8:16 okay that's just like naming a boat Titanic like we all know what happened to Aurora in Subnautica
where are your references?
ALL OF THEM
thats insane
I subscribed   to your vidieo
Mars colonization finally getting underway is what I look forward to.  Of course I won't be alive at 2050 even at the bright side of things...
The contents of this video could be kind of accepted only if I had read it on a magazine article from 1970. Specially the medical improvement and human body enhancements 'predictions' are excessively optimistic and obviously not possible in the proposed time frame.
Perfect preparation for the arrival of the Antichrist!
I look forward to people joining the ranks of short-sightedness
Im 11 YAAY I WILL GET TO SEE ALL OF IT YEEE
I don't believe that asteroid will come close to the earth
I want dubai to bulid the tallest tower who agree with me
I’m not even American nor European but we need to stop population. First of all we need to start china, india and middle east
I will enjoy the mini ice age because my dad’s business supplies gas and he is the CEO so we will be making big money 💰
Of course all this assumes that the forces of regression and 7th century desert savagery haven't spread like a virus destroying all the cultures who have made this progress possible.
The Mars One program was a hoax
2019 Big Boy Back on rails.

Wow❔
I predict earth won’t be alive by 2050
FOR THE 1000 TIMES FASTER INTERNET OFC!
Hopefully that thing doesn’t hit earth):
Hopefully, in the future, all we have to do is inject something in the baby's head and then they will never have to go to school
In 2050 all YouTube videos you see today will be gone and most YouTubers you watch will stop recording
6:12 YAY I'm looking forward to google making the internet 1000 times faster
By 2050 we have bionic eyes, but the ice cream machine at McDonald’s is still broken.

Something that you not counting are, The Return of Jesus Christ by that time Jesus Could be back in here ruling like, the supreme king.
THE BRIGHT SIDE!!! I AM A KID . THIS IS SO HARD TO ANSWER  THIS  QUESTION! WHY WE CAN FEEL OURSELVES?
WARNING!!!!!!! do not click read more!                I WARNED YOU!!!!!!!!!
I don't care about the inventions.I just wish my parents would be still alive by the year 2050,2060,2070....
Until and unless we do something to control the population, none of the advancements would be able to make our lives better, as a whole, on this planet. :(
7:09 Astronaut? you Mean Astroid
By 2050, we'll be able to infuse ourselves with memes
I've been in Burj Khalifa but not in the most highest floor :D (ya know it costs like 900AED) (dats alot of money)

I hope there will be robotics stuff that make your human bones into robots and make you live forever...
I think the earth will come up with an artificial ozone  layer
2050 colony on Mars! !
Why is everyone scared of this?
4:45.  Electric cars use much energy to reload. Hybrid cars or hydrogen cars are better. Experiments are currently being made to make it safe.
Well I think this will happen that is if only those "world war 3 - nuclear warfare" controversy theories wouldn't occur first But then again these are just theories. I believe the world is peaceful as of now (at least on the case of the planning of nuclear warfare - I hope XD) , and also that society knows the outcome of nuclear warfare enough to not even think about it. But then again, the future is unpredictable, you can present possible outcomes but not all will come or maybe it will but it will be further off into the future. I love how the video approach the future more positively, but there are quite many problems environmentally, economically, and politically that makes these outcomes in comparison just a dream at the moment really.
I hope in future my mom will understand that u cant pause online game
I'd love to keep watching but the narrator's voice is too annoying to be heard for 12 minutes straight.

Every single wisecrack this guy makes I always just want to say "HAHHAHAHAHAH OH YOURE SO FUNNY."
who else noticed the plane flying by the Jeddah tower
This scares me. The world is being taken over my robotics :(
I don't know how
quantum teleportation is already done in the Netherlands in 2016. Old News
yo I'm from jeddah it is in Saudi Arabia well my father already told me about the tallest building so umm bye
I think short sightedness phenomenon will certainly occur. At the rate we are using smartphones, its possible. Most of the kids nowadays always use smartphones, that too at a dangerous period of time😢😢😢
We dont know what happens at 2050, but God knows, hes the one who created everything and he will know what will happen on the future. But i bet everything will be gone because the earth is no longer destroyed and everything also will be destroyed
It stressed me
My imagination is saying there will be helpful robots :D
Well , is quite hard to know if some of this things will happend , but are a lot of signs that indicate that we are going in that way . For me personally is ridiculous and scary at the same time . Is perfect natural to evolve , to want revolution , to create , to make the life better but the idea is that doing all of these things we take a lot of beauty and charm from life. Well , i am sure that most people will disagree this thing , especially "The SmartPhone Era" . The biggest malfunction of human is that in someway he always what to come close to the word "Perfect" .. I really do not know how to say this , to make sure that everyone understand but we are live in this universe because of imperfection , if it wasn't for that , maybe we would't exist at all . We can't let the tehnology to surpass our human interaction .. humans are made to live together , to have interaction , to experience , to made mistakes , to feel , to love...all of these things having to happend outside , face to face..not in front of a screen and many other things..when you put tehnology in this whole ecuation the result is not the favourite one. I agree..tehnology is usefull , is better to send a message on facebook than to write a letter and arrive to a individual 3 days later , you can search the information faster , but also you have acces to a log of negative information and we are asking "Why are happend so many bad things" .. Everything on internet can be changed , scripted only to show what they want us to see .. and most of us are inflenced  by it. We"ll get to be led and destroyed(i hope not) by our creation , our invention if we don't realise that the nature has his own way , we can not control the world , we are not control it , we dominate it and is something different. I do not want to lie down to much but as i was saying above we will never reach perfection only because human by definiton , by his nature is better not to be like that and life is better not to be like that as well and this things give to people so many feelings..Hope , Confidence , Fear , Love . I with this i will end..About this thing present in the video that at some point we will interaction with robots is a truely abberation ( to not say other word ) .. We will create robots to facilitate our work , to save time for us and to leave them to work because we can programme them to work close to perfection at a highter speed. Any creation has a weakness , any .. especially whes is made by someone who is not perfect.. even if we not see the weakness or we not believe in it , everything on this world has a weakness , if we create something with the idea of making it perfect (it will never be) we will be disappointed.Tehnology in my opinion is a safe time which poison the time we gained if we don't know how to manage the tehnology .. and are many other things that people do agains nature .. but do not worry .. nature always find a way . At the i want to say that this is only my personal opinion , others do not need to share it and they don't need to feel outraged , or bad . We have to live and see what will happend , these things what we doing here are just words and imagination of what and how we see the future. Best of luck for all in the future and i wish you all a very happy end of the year . All the best.
I don't want it to be the future D:
A lot
Right now, I'm 8 years old, so I'm gonna be 40 years ago

lol i found this in a reply on someone's comment : ༼(∩ ͡°╭͜ʖ╮͡ ͡°)༽⊃━☆ﾟ. * ･ ｡ﾟ
11:30 ew your British
For Mr brightside  Did not reply to your video cause I did not want to tell you what a young 13 yr old girl  told the world  Ever heard of Arcticgreening ?  Ever heard that 54% of the world wealth is in hands of 1%  Ever heard of +65 Million Children dieng of bad NUTRITION  Ever heard of the North Pole melting will release more co2 & loads of methane & reflected t less sunlite back & glaciers dissapearing & huge water shortages ?  Ever heard of 6 mass extinction taking place right now  Every positive thing you said on you're so nicely spoken video can be bad for +70 of humanity  I still don't know what's positive bout world reaching 9 billion  Ever heard of seakrill dieng & guess how important these seakrill are cause they absorb co2  Ever heard that eating once meat daily destroys +3500 tress  & one year without paper only 8 tress  I could go on forever but I don't want to criticize you  Only their has to be a resistance against fake stories  I loved the fact that u did a video until 2050 but do not tell children  Their ain't gonna be as much fish as plastic & microplastic in the ocean  Do you really think we have a chance I know people who load their car through fossil fuel electricity & claim to be saving the environment by driving electric cars I could go on forever cause I wanna give children hope  I've lived my life & this is what I don't like about such topics  But why do you not watch the video of the girl that silenced all in the un conference  Don't take it to personal we have to give children hope  Not on video & saying the right thing  But also doing the right thing  But I guess ure life is ok & why should u care  Guess what my parents worked for the unitednation sent me to best schools & I got myself a job in UN & had 💲  I resigned that how corrupt people are  Sorry but ure video makes maybe some kids happy but it's not helping millions of children who are happy to just have a meal a day For the wealthy all is great we know that  But not for the children who plan to live with just one meal a day  How can anyone see anything POSITIVE when so many children suffer  Sorry nothing positive I can use on this video  If u want to discuss it anytime if u want in 5 languages ☮️ peace
In 2050 I'll be 60. I'm scared!! 😑😑
the rapture will short circuit all your prophecy.
the astronaut colliding with earth
This is annabell 👱🏻‍♀️                              👚                               👢 She is unoriginal (so am I) one like and annabell will be old enough to die
Aren't we expecting too much?
For 2019, India has a zoo without cages
I'll be 40 in 2050 omg and my little sister will be 38!!
WHY DO HUMANS WANT ROBOTS SO BAD
Yay

More than 7billion views in 2050
Do what will happen by 2100
They said that a private space company will be able to get out of the universe by 2028
Brain implants, xray eyes, cant wait
I'll be 57 in 2050

with the advancement of technology, we will not be needing SMART FONES in the future bcoz  our ownselves will be our SMART FONES  by then, micro chips will be implanted in our bodies to receive signals ang messages...
how can humans develop short-sighted if we look at close things all the time
By 2050 Isreal will become world most powerul country and will lead new world order . There will be no fiat currency . You fogot to include cryptocurrency use in ur list
For humans to travel in deep space they need to become cybernetic ,
Nothing
I don't know why but I believe it anyway
Too many people in the world
Stop it
I was really hoping that the end of world poverty and hunger would be on there😪
what will happened after 2050? The humans will stay as a human..
Dude ima be 49 when these things happen
@bright side where can i get the electrical stimuli... if the us military have it then i want  it too... sounds like a drug too me
Finding a curious for disabilities.
Forget computers live like prehistoric people it is in our blood and stop the population I a scared for our dark future
Were ruining the world
2:45 uh why the plane here headed towards the building in a relatively 2d shot
I think cars will be pretty cool
If Judgement Day Or End Of The World Is Truly Real, I Hope By Then I've Died Long Time Ago Cause I Wanna Live My Life To The Fullest And Grow Old With My Loved Ones 🙆
Shortsightedness is good for working on tiny electronic components without having to wear a visor. xD
The way we human's are killing each other and wars I don't see how we will even make it to 2050 good luck 🤔
I am so worried about overpopulation killing the Earth
no one will ever stay alive for a year except for on earth
I would like to go to that Danish Zoo. Still gotta wait a bit though. :(
This is far too optimistic. Is more like in best scenarios . More likely is to happen ww3. Uncontrollable man made virus.  Or nature will decide to punish us for missusing our lovely planet.
How can big cities have 6,3 billion people, when the world population is esitmated to be 11 billion people within 2050?
xD the  world will be back
the mars mission definitely. ❤😍
IM SUBBING EVERYONE WHO SUBS AND LIKE THIS COMMENT

Fake fake do not watch
This is fake if you want to predict tomorrow just read the bible
Who else born in the year 2000 and gonna be 50 in 2050 😩😩😩 yucky i don’t want to grow old
How about the presidents ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Guys it's fake

An astronaut colliding with earth. 🤔hmmm. Interesting.

Cancer cure

Overpopulation an issue? Thanos has the right idea.

Thank you for saying good things 😁. This made my day!
Jesus will return soon, get saved.
8:02 fear the old blood
I would love living in Mars but most probably these things are not gonna happen for sure
Sometimes I have thoughts at random for no reason at all then a few days to months later it happens.
Denmarks zoo without cages? South africa already has this, its the Kruger National Park
So that means that we will get robots like detroit become human like whaaaaat?
No fair i want to live longer
I live in Denmark so the zoo
I’m actually pretty scared. what if the asteroid hit earth! Or the ice age kills a lot of people! One thing I want though is for Androids to come 😂
In 2050 the world will have 9billion people and people who live in the middle of nowhere like me will be working for you guys to get everything
I might still be alive when we colonize mars, depends if some murderer stabs me, or i commit suicide.
What if this is secretly purgatory and we just don't know it yet?
?????? Pls tell me i want to know
SUBNUTICA
In the Year 2525! This all sounds so very nice but it has this "Orwellian" undercurrent imo. Life is never going to be nice for the overwhelming majority of humanity. It will become more & more dystopian with more progress.
2051: Half life 3 - Teaser Trailer
I look forward to stop wrinkles, genetic editing if I have a baby so that it lives a long healthy life, and going to Mars :D

Mars colonisation but you know probably won’t live that long
I KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN 50 YEARS!     THERE WILL BE AN IPHONE 3000!!
The charging using WiFi, this is something I mentioned a lot when I was studying, my teacher said it was impossible and would never be done, but cables and wires are undesirable and will be a thing of the past
im only 44 in 2050
Wait wait please dont scare me about 99942 Apophis cause im a kid that gets scared of everything like asteroids.
I’ll be alive by 2050 oof

He said "Astronaut" instead of "Asteroid" 7:12
Ooooooooooh... 2019        The future is going to be weird 😥😥😥

U sound like a radio show host
**Thanos has angrily left the chat**
Oh my god we will not be able to teleport??!!!!
The astronaut will have a 2.7% chance of hitting 😂😂
Who else thought that there would be androids in 2038 because of detroit become human XD
7:11 Probability of the Astronaut?
I like the electric car part because oil cars are doing a lot of damage to the earth
I would think that technology be so high it will be the city’s of tomorrow
Dude how do u know it's should be like 1% of this is real
fuj!
Hey you forgot something I will be a graduate
And now I want to live in the year 1980 as a norman and organic human.
What will happen to humans before 2050: still be able to breathe
2035 mini ice age not global warming
not looking forward to transhumanism
None of them because it’s breaking people
I am 12  Maybe I can watch them
the first thing i thought of was natural disasters and people dying...so much from a depressed person
future is dangerous
I KNOW...I KNOW!!!  2049!!!
singularity and gene modification!
Well im definitely going to mars
143 years to build something who tf was building it a waffle
And finally extraterrestres will be here among us!
What about world war  III?

The mini ice age 😁
Thanos will wipe out whole universe before 2020 😂😂
i live in danmark yayyyy!!!
if someone knocked at my door by 2050, asking if i want a brain implant, i will litterally freak out oof  *tECHNOLOGY HAS GONE TOO FAR*
I am not looking forward to the Islamization of Europe and the civilized west.  I am not looking forward to social security becoming insolvent.  I am not looking forward to America becoming a third world toilet because of unchecked immigration from third and fourth world countries. I am not looking forward to the national electric grid failing.  I am not looking forward to world financial system collapse under the weight of debt. I am not looking forward to being right about these things.
I feel I won’t even be alive in 2050, and I’m only 18!
i want go back to early 2000s
I wont have $ to go to mars
In 2038, Cyber Life androids will fight humans for their freedom!!   Someone better get this reference
50%😢
So some partial fact mixed with your messed up fantasy
I an looking forward to dying
Complete bs. They also predicted we will all be using flying cars etc by now. Oh no i forgot, they were predicting a parallel dimension......
In 2050 I'll be 54 years old....oh wow
so basically at 5:51 we wont have another chernobol. :)
How much people live in the sun?
WHAT! Now i have to worry more about the future im just a young average 10 year old and ill be a 60 year old talking about a iPhone X to my Grand kids. And they will have like an iPhone XYZ and says that they are cooler then me
The Future is scary.......      I don't know the reason why I said that, but..... I just feel like something humans did not interpreted yet will happen. And suddenly gave me goosebumps. But really.THE  FUTURE WE ARE WAITING FOR , IS NOT WHAT'S PLANNED TO HAPPEN.  EVERYONE OF US WILL BE THE ONLY WITNESSES OF THIS UPCOMING.
#thanossnap
another prediction!: in 2020 there will be world war 3  (not my idea tho)
I don’t care I’ll be dead
I just have one thing to say about this video...no matter what prediction or assumption you people come up with, it's still not going to happen because what is said throughout the video is not backed up with any evidence whatsoever. What if what is 'supposed to happen' ultimately fails because of wild guesses about what will happen in the future that don't even make sense?
Omg, I'll be 44 in 2050! The world will be so advanced.
2038 will be a good year
I never like to leave my past and present because it will became useless that things i like
Im so sad that sending people to Mars took too long. Im justso Excited about it, I thought they're gonna send people on mars in the year 2024. Ill be 50+years old when that happen, I can't wait to have people visited and are living in mars.
Will this all happen if the valcano in wyoming yellow stone  erupt ?
I will be just 44 😭
The one were im not alive
Where are my jetpacks?
2050 Dystopian world with no freedom of thought or speech
And sir how do you it is gonna happend(it is not like u collab with god)
ONE THING FOR SURE , WHITE SUPREMACY IS COMING TO À DEVASTATING END.
Stop this lying UNSUBSCRIBBING AND DISLIKING ALL YOUR VIDS
Sometimes the future is scary af no joke
2090 2018 was zombies 🧟‍♀️ 46788546
Yes you $56788999999999’5655566666
They will get older is the correct answer
Who cares about this...there will be battlefield 5, call of duty black ops 4 and hitman 2 in 2018...
MARS
Population density stress is killing us now and will increase at an exponential rate, sort of Malthus on steroids.    Stress R Us
Can I have copy right for theHUB's video that has the same image but blue?
I hope to God none of these happen. Especially the mini ice age.
2050!! I cant wait that long to go to Mars!!
at least trump won’t be president anymore
Colonization of mars I’m tired of earth 🌏 and I hope Lil Wayne be buried there cause he’s a Martian 👽
I am in my dads account
I am scared stop
i have a feeling the glaciers will melt and wipe out most of the population before such events
7:07 wow fail he said astronaut ment asteroid
I am 11 so so I cart want for Mars to be a plant
None
I don't want to live on this planet anymore..
7:13 geeez...hope that astronaut doesn’t hit us!
I'll be 50 in 2050 ♥
When are we going to run out of antibiotics?
Electric City.
The bit about sending craft to Alpha Centauri is BS. It would take our fastest spacecraft 50K years to reach it. It's over 4 light years away.
If global warming isn't stopped there won't be any future.
I like the brain implants to improve intellect...
4:35 im from norway but this is not acceteble :(
As fertility rates are crashing around the world, it's quite possible that world population is near peak now.  We might reach 8 billion people but after that population might go down.
I wish we all watching this video will witness these adventures
I’d love bionic eyes 👀
10:48 what does this mean?  It means my name is Conner, I’m the android sent by cyber life
2:44 9/11 again?
In 2025 I’ll be graduating College :D
you forgot ww3
I hope I'm dead by this time!!! We already have cardi and nickis fight as something we care.
I don't really like this future
No zombie apocalypse then?
Wow
4:46
You forgot to mention when the zombie outbreak will start
Hope I'll be alive
who's watching in 2018
I'm looking forward to, taking some years off, between 10 and 20 years or more..I know in 4055 it will definitely be possible..they will live to be 400 years old..
The return of Christ!!!
No burj khalifa will always be the biggest the Jeddah tower is the biggest space building L
as long as there is pizza and Netflix, i'm good 😐
"And theyll all be in line at Starbucks" I dont  have a starbucks in my area, and there never will be.
I have dreams about the end of the world every night :/
Wow by 2050 I’ll be 43 years old and I’m 10 now, oh I can’t wait to see what happens in the future and I’ll live till 2108 (if I’m lucky) because I was born in 2008, let’s just hope that the human race doesn’t end by then, if not then I’ll probably see the first humans on Mars or another solar system or maybe even WW3 and hello to anyone in the future who’s reading this (including myself) and have a great day or night!
Hopefully, the singularity can cure death.
An asteroid or ASTRONAUT is gonna pass by earth in 2019? Listen at 7:12.
The future is messed up.
I look forward to none of it at all... Except the ice age
I hope that no one come to space in 2050.
he sounds like Tom leykis
Ohohh um the r34 becoming legal
Brain implants
Bionic eyes
so in 2020, the amount of IRS scammers will skyrocket.
2:44 is a bit eerie...
I want a faster wifi thats all im looking forwards to Lol
8:13 i live in a city named aurora
Half of this will happen
2051 memes will rise and revolt against us eventually wiping out all of humanity and colonizing the galaxy using our technology
I'm watching this in 2050
JFK assassination will be open to the public much sooner than you predict. Q
2098 I am gonna live too or above without natural caused
More pollution, more garbage, more forest fires, more deforestation, more trash floating in the sea, more people, taller buildings, faster airplanes, faster computers, fewer elephants, fewer whales, fewer rhinos, fewer fish, more inflation, less meat for human consumption, more GMO foods, more vaccines, higher age of retirement, more RF pollution, more noise in people’s ears, heavier people, airplane cars, hover boards,
im scared..
The politician will promise a better future life and the priest will promise a better after life. Beware of these two types of people who have no accountability. The producer of this video also has no IDENTITY.  :-)
I want to go to mars!!!
Lol 7:05. He said astronaut instead of asteroid
So if we move to Mars we have to wear an oxygen helmet all the time? Even in our sleep?
10:05 so if you're a critical thinker you don't have a life...? -.-
Future seems bright for hackers...
still no flying cars???
Ha he says “astronaut” instead of “asteroid” 7:10
Dang... ill be 53 by the time its 2050
Why are we trying to destroy other planets now? 😕
In 2050 we still eat rice
what about "The New World Order"? will it be achieved by then?
In 2021... The Philippines’s MRT- 7 Project will be finished (Quezon City, Manila)
that never happened dubai and Nepal is now 2075  and that never happend in thre
The only thing mentioned I beleive is the 50 per cent shortsightedness in the year 2050
Time travel might also be possible in year 2036 as per a time traveller
In 2050 we will air the final episodes of various shows from our channel. That much is true. Although the majority have yet to even come close to being script worthy
Subnatica in 2033  Detroit become human in 2045     Honestly i just want to be able to charge my phone with wifi😂
In 2050 i hope parents will understand online videogames cannot be paused. Also, i want a robot butler.
ew electric cars
I want Google to be 1000 times faster
32 years later....... comments: HEY THIS IS CLICKBAIT NOTHING EVER HAPPENED LOL Exept fortnite created a new season and it hasn't happened in 3 decades 9 year olds are taking over again nooo ruuuunnnn!!!!!!! Aahhhhhh 😂
Your saying theirs only girls!?
Still no flying cars 😑
you copied kento bento
I hopw tour right about all this stuff. :D
Live longer? Didn't the life expectancy DROP in the usa by a big chunk recently? Not to mention that so far birth rates are DROPPING and if the generation after the millennial generation drops lower then chances of reaching 9 billion like the now outdated info is unlikely
7:08 "The probability of the astronaut colliding with earth is..." boi.
Who made that video, doctor who?
1000x faster internet sounds amazing
Ummm if there will be less food and world war three are you sure that they will be that much people on earth.but the brain implants...... ok that’s a bit to much don’t you think sorry well they may not be world war three but like still
Oh boy, can't wait for over population
I hope Trump doesn't destroy the world by then
i will start starbucks on mars 2060,which i know :)
I’m excited for the brain implants because I’m Brain-Injured
"Come on people, get alive!" regarding  the JFK assassination shows that this channel is nothing for brain users.
Nuclear war in 2050
*Nothing.*
I’m looking forward to death :)
In 2150 there will be no land for agricultural.
I hope the us switches to the metric system... but that may be a little too much to ask
Technology singularity and colonialism of Mars feels great
Too bad I will be around 60 by the time the cool technological implants come out
In year 2060 there will be no people that were born in the 19s
Nobody is going to mars because elon musk randomly left his company
I was hoping they would find a cure for all cancer by 2050
So Killers should be respected! They try to help by killing peoples, so there it wouldn't be over populated and we would be missing food.
go back to school you cant charge a phone with wifi
I will only be 44 years old☹️😱😬😭
You sound like swagger souls
9 billion people..... we are gonna need another war
I just hope flim industry will never shut down coz i wanna become the biggest movie star on Earth
None of these things seem too impossible to me, considering 100 years ago, our modern world was just being born.
7:13 “the probability of the astronaut colliding with Earth”   ASTRONAUT? Hahahaha
I can’t wait for the camera eye contacts!
I am waiting for short sightedness
i will be 46 I think in 2050
space hotel lol i think its way much costly than to going on moon for just a view some will spend money
The question is , are we still going to have to listen to Mariah Carey Christmas song by 2050?
i like the contact lense ones, HAHA girl its fun
I’ll be 48 in 2050 still up and kicking
Great video!
I know I’ll be 44 when the time comes, but I’m still SOOOOOOOOOOOO excited AAA
At 7:10 he says astronaut instead of asteroid
How can you predict that 50%of the world will suffer from short-sightedness?? What's the proof??
Somebody’s been watching too much futurama
I'm looking forward for that astroyed not hitting us
The genetic engineering and cyber implants will give the wealthy even more of an advantage over everyone else because they will literally be superior to us in every conceivable way. We might see a rise in classicism that hasn't been seen since the caste system. Could lead to wars, segregation, eugenics, indentured servitude, genocide, etc.
I would say 2050 cause Stephen Hawkins said that the world will be destroy if we all don’t change our ways and that aliens was go take over our planet .
Would the mini ice age heal the artic?
Hello bright side speaking in 2098  ww3 has been here and time travel is here climate change is very true
This makes me feel so old
2022 because gta 6 will be out
whats up with the starbucks joke?
Excuse meh you forgot world war 3
I can't wait for androids that look like humans!
Is everyone gonna like what will happen before the 2050s?
2036 World War III will occur
what if memes will not exist? what a nightmare
No more 🌲 😢
how do you know this
I will be 48 years in 2050 😭i want to enjoy my life in Mars
By 2050 we would have artificial dreams, a cure for these ones
Yaw don't know he ain't 199 percent sure
well good thing im a lesbian
in the year 2044, people still watching dragon ball z
OMG U KNOW THE FUTURE?
The thing that scared me about the future is the human population going to 9billion people😩😩😩
I’ll be 42 in 2050
Lol "Take that job" "Countries" "Stocks" None of those are gonna exist after the Revolution. If this video doesn't mention the very likely Communist Revolution then its lying to you.
I will still be alive in 2050
I can't wait for bionoc eyes
By the next 12 minutes and 12 seconds I will have watched this video
2026: Barcelona here I come
no half life 3 in 2050
You miss the world end prediction  for 2019
8:22  SUBNAUTICA
The future sucks
Illuminati confirmed they already have all these things they are just releasing them one year at a time we are so much further in technology than what they lead on how else could you predict all these things ??
i dont want the future
I'm happy for this of humans....but sad that at that time people will become more or almost fully dependent on machines....🙍🙍
This scares me and I don’t quite know why.
In 2050 ill be in my 60s 🤪
Why can't Kashmir be an independent country 🙁
As neat as this all sounds. I have doubts lol maybe some of this might happen, some of it already has
Willy wonka and the great glass elevator? 3:21
Is the producer of this video is a time traveler?
uhm. Could you post your sources? would be nice to know what knowledge you based your video on :)
Good thing bye 2034 fortnite will be dead
I don’t see them colonizing mars by 2050. That’s quite soon. Maybe 2100
You scrolling a comment  If you see my comment Give a like😍
7:10 I don't know about the probability of an Astronaut colliding with earth. But I feel bad for the Astronaut!!!
Make flying cars already
Yup I think I want to be dead before all that(camera eyes, seriously?)
In 2050 Earth will be greenish and tall buildings. People travel through flying cars. People will become unity with others. People live on Mars even on Sun also.
Looking forward to? ..... ima be dead fool   Kidding I’m 15
He said astronaut instead of asteroid.
i dont want things to have my brain print thank you very much
The year 2049 will happen before year 2050
We just can pray and hard effort
Im scared
In ???? Youtube will shutdown
So there only be girls ya right
You forgot that geder roles will be reveresed
Cool thanks
In the year 2050 everyone will finally have moved away from inches and feet.
Everything is going to be worser
Zombie Apocalypse
Just me that heard him say "Astronaut" instead of Astroid at 7:10 ?
What do u really look like in real life..??      Like of u wanna know      I DO!         I'm first...            to like my own comment! 😋
All of this stuff is gonna happen in my lifetime im only 16 rn
Idiots
I hope i live long enough to enjoy this 😊
Science is going to far
8:17 lego
Who the h3ll would live in space....
I will like sub and share if he says *Just Kidding* at the end of the video
Self driving cars would be great!
What about all the hunger which will come with the raise of the population, the wars to come for resources and space! WW3 is very realistic to happen within this time. Religion will be more dangerous than ever and globalization will be a huge problem. There will be much more poor people than 'normal' ppl now. Many  jobs will not be available anymore because ppl will forget how to... new and dangerous deseases will come and because of the growing population they will spread more easyly than ever. and many many more things will happen. sorry for my english!
Colonization of Mars is expected to start in the year 2032, not 2050. https://www.mars-one.com/mission/roadmap
Trump 2020. His vision is perfect.
in year 2050
this is albert.       😂 👋👕👌      👖       👞 every time you don't like this comment he won't care. every time you do like this comment he won't care.  he won't care no matter what you do
i wish that exams get banned by 2050
I think before those things happen......the earth will be destroyed by the humans😑😑
Any from 2050?
I am looking forward to shrek 5
Will there be a cure for stupidity? Because there are a lot of those infected with that syndrome.
So were all going to ignore him saying astronaut instead of asteroid 7:13...
I litterally dont care wat happens as long as I live for America’s tricentennial
So I will be 48 on 2050.
Colonization on MARS?? Sounds cool but...Earth is my home I ain’t going NOWHERE F@$& You NASA and SpaceX you can do whatever you want just keep that away from me
if that comet hit we would have the easy way out but if not only smart people wil be fine if u don't know wat I mean ill give one example                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               EYE
Maybe Slim will reply to MGK lol
2050 - half life 3 come to pc :)
Im in Philippines that far away
I don't think any of this stuff will come true, I mean how would he know all this stuff if he is in the present
so tesla who is making roughly just under 30,000 cars per quarter will make 125,000 per quarter next year >> "rolls eyes"
wow I will be 45 in 2050 that is awesome
Before we move to Mars or if there is life on Mars we should sort out life on Earth and all this tech has already been developed, they just roll it out slowly over decades
idgaf what year it is I'll always drive my ss
Spoiler alert
communist america
What the heck making earth much worse stop having babies!!!
to answer the question in the title: no one knows! why? because no one knows the future!
7:11 you said astronaut instead of asteroid
2:45 totally thought that was gonna 9/11
I see, so we're on the road to banning fossil fuels but the ice shelf's are still going bye bye.
Ill be in mars bye
In the year 2050 i will be 56 thats how old my grandmother was when she died , but im hoping that by then the singularity will have birthed an active and benevolent artificial diety and the nanites in my body will keep me in perfect health indefinately
gcse's and a levels will get harder
In 2033 I will come hera to edit the wrong spelling.
Bionic eyes
Nooooooo
You missed Article 13, 11, etc. wiping out the Internet if it gets voted this autumn... :P  And hopefully the collapse of the EU. ^_^
OMG i will have 50 years
Mumble rap will be much worse 😂😂😂😂
Mini ice age? Isn't that good for global warming?
Project Zorgro is watching ....
Project Zorgro is watching....
spoiler
2:45 😮  Prediction? I guess we'll have to wait and see
we cant live without nucler power until green power are so strong as nucler plant
2050
Can they predict when starbucks is comming to Mars?
Bright side will have 5 billion subs(If they dont quit or Youtube doesnt get banned)
I will be 57 in 2050. I highly doubt we will make it that far.
I'm looking forward to the faster internet, cheaper solar panels, and more electric vehicles.
Hey, I'm from the Future. And your prediction was wrong about Mars. It's year 2054 and we are living on planet venus. We created the planet inhabitable. Trump started  world War 3 in past and now the earth is like venus.
Detroit androids
We should watch this again in 2050 and see what was true and what wasn't.
Donald Trump is the Trump of God.
Donald Trump is the Trump of God!
if that stimulant tech they where using for soldiers became available for the common man, then your prediction with "they all still be lined up at starbucks" is wrong. We won't need coffee at that point...
are we not going to mention robots?? like, people have already made a robot that became self aware and started having 'feelings' people also created two robots that had to be shut down because they created their own language and started speaking to each other in said language and of course the robot that literally said one day they will take over the world is no one questioning robots?!
The probability of the "(Astronaut)"!!!! colliding with the earth whutttt????
Off all the ice melts the world would flood
So what happen to the kardashians?
When you say mini ice age you gotta go more in depth 🤦‍♂️
Who is watching in 2080 😂😂😂
Hmmmm are you sure this is going to happen ? I dont know about this i will think about it 🤔🤔🤔😂😂😂😂
You forgot World war 3 ……………. And you don't know if nature disasters are going to do something
7:12 did he just say astronaut instead of asteroid? :O
I am 70 now I don't care for 2050
Is it just me or does anyone wanna become a cyborg. Especially after this video
I'm really scared of this future :( I want it like now. The heck scary thing is the population...😯
I hope to be dead peacefully! thanks!😉😉😉😉😉
always think about pros and cons peeps...🤭😂🤣 just in case this events happens...,
ALL OF THEM
very informative!!!!!!!!
2050... and the Berlin airport is still not finished!
Who knows when what can happen except the God!
2026 is the best because the internet will be faster 1000 times so we can play any online game on 0 ping
I live in Saudi Arabia and that will happen i did not notice
He said, "astronaut" instead of "asteroid"; cheap. Hopefully, humans will be gone before any of this happens.
Its crazy how people can do all this yet CANT LET YOU LISTEN TO MUSIC ON YT WITH UR  PHONE TURNED OFF
STOP FRICKIN LYINGGGGGGGGGG
Bright side... where do you get these information from...
The narrator needs a hug.
2051 : Pubnite WILL CHARGE PHONES WITH WIFI?! THE FUTURE OF OUR CONNECTION
I want it to become 1992 suddenly and just pause forever
Harimau?
dejavoo!!
It’s that possible maybe it is but I hope that asteroid won’t mess up earth again.
i only watched this to see if there is anything on androids in 2038. i was disappointed.
Hhhmmmmm🤔🤭🙄😲😬😧
Well im happy by tis video
2:26 in 2020 i will make 2 new videos
When where going to build spaceships ?
Is Tupac still alive
see, I would believe a majority of this but . . .  1980- "By 2015, there will be flying cards" 2018- *Kiki challenge*
In the year 2050, I'll be 50 years old. Weird to think about.
2025 8 Billion 2018 (current day. ) 8 Billion  K
I looking forward for the live to be longer because when I have a kid they will live long
There will be about atleast 413545182581 genders by 2050
What will happen before 2050?  We all watch this video before this site becomes a ghost town.
We will age and be old.
YOUR PREDICTIONS ARE NOT EXACTLY PLAUSIBLE.................when I was in the FIRST GRADE  , in 1959 - 60 , my " WEEKLY READER " predicted ,  that by the year 2000 , we'd all be living like THE JETSONS ..................YEAH RIGHT AND I'M  JANE HIS WIFE..................
You will need a good job to earn monye wich is the only thing speaks in the future
Im actually afraid because of the economy.
To see the fulfillment from the Lord's prayer: Let God's Kingdom come! Add it is in heaven...
Definitely not not the astrodes
I be 64yrs old lololol
One thing I’m sure of  We won’t have tropical forests or coral reefs anymore
I am looking forward to short-sighting....
7:11 the probability of the astronaut colliding with earth ??? hahah lol imagine
So stuff to help mental disabilities???? Uhhh im looking forward to that!
"astronaut colliding with earth" lol
95% BS
The deafness and blindness cure is what I'm looking forward to because I'm rapidly going deaf and slowly but surely blind...
I don't know if this is fake or real
I don't like this at all,  we are slowly losing what makes us human amd are becoming more artificial
Solar systems
He said 2019 was next year, but for me I’m watching in 2019. 😂  lol
I'm so gonna come back to this video in 2050 😂😂😂
In 2050, the Playstation 13 will be released
All I know is ant no one putting a device in me that the mark of the beast
Most of them are wrong... there is no United States , UK,Russia,Germany or Iran and China....There will be somthink called HUMANITY..i am sorry but there will be no differences between people around the world
🌸
Nightmare
Just watch Black Mirror!!
I WANNA LIVE ON MARS!!!
Is the narrator the same man that did the Scene It games?
mars colonization
Guy sounds like old sheldon.
Hi. Love your vid
i find it fascinating that i will be alive when/if these things happen. 2050 sounds so far away, yet it’s only 32 years away. so many amazing things can happen between now and then and that just seems so cool to me.
maybe by the time 2050, fort nite might be gone
I was born in 1970 so I will be 80 years old (if I'm still alive)… I would like for their to be some kind of system where people don't have to pay for anything... everything is free... healthcare, college, household bills... even things like groceries … I want money to not exist...
I'm looking forward to the mini ice age
I think that there will be at least 137 genders
Yay it's almost 2019 it's the 9th month
Mars being a place to live
That’s scary
No wonder why one of the most exiting things come from Elon Musk :D
We're slowly killing this planet and all the animals with it. What's the point if we're the only ones
living on Mars
That's IT...I'm going off to make a 1980's Colony.....Going to be Amish 1985.
Ok ima be like 50 when this will happen ;-; sigh
electric cars i rather gas lol
You for got 2018 zombies
This channel will have 150millon subscribers by 2050
I'm 20 yrs but don't know what I'll do & should do. Why am I living.  Somebody help me!
Colonizing Mars sounds LIT :)
exited
i was hoping they'd have cures for cancer and other diseases by them but i guess not.
I'll be 44 yo hahahahah omg
Earth could continue to host life for at least another 1.75 billion years, as long as nuclear holocaust, an errant asteroid or some other disaster doesn't intervene, a new study calculates.
Aurora.....  Seems to be inspired from Subnautica.
In 2050 this channel will be forgotten.
at least fortnite will R.I.P
and waht about the fact that the whole world will be filled with trash and chemicals?
Astronaut colliding earth :-D
I think it's gonna be beyond our imagination.
Do you guys believe the astroid will hit earth in 2029 Cause I don't because it's rule out that mean the asteroid won't hit earth in 2029 The Asteroid is not going to hit earth in 2029 it rule out And it's Fake So don't  be scared people  we will be fine
Contact lenses as cameras, injectable brain stuff     *Black Mirror anyone*
In the year 2525 if man is still alive, if woman can survive, this is what they may find.
There will be a cure for cancer.
back to the future
Hope no robot that year
Do I be amazed or scared about what's to come in the future?
Want to know about the future?     Me too.
According what is happening in the world today, all the GMOS and toxins we are surrounded with 2050 it doesn't looks promising for human kind. If our human kind survive it would be mirrical, Few toxic brains gathered in Washington with help of Jewish mafia, want to destroyed most of humanity, with any means now this is reality.
Don't worry everyone we can move to another planet 🌎
Oswald didn't even assassinate president Kennedy, get a life
I imagine .......TIME WILL GIVE THE ANSWER
But i think in 2029 the asteroid will go over earth. Like if you agree!
First of all the callendars stop at 2020 AKA The end of time
I'm scared now
I saw my country philipines
After 2026 it’s all just made up
I’ll be 51 and still workin it!
I think before the 21 century is over we will all be facing extinction one way or another
i’m gonna be 45 in 2050
I hope the internet becomes 1,000 times faster!
Did no one notice he said astronaut instead of asteroid
where are not measure in feet  but in meters or KM
I don't know why people are scared, progress is a natural part of our civilization for thousand of years.
I'm excited about the eye mods and prosthetics!
I will be 44
All humans will just be philosophers by 2050.
Brain transplant
All of that is great but I didn't see anything about poverty going down. Yet the population will continue to grow. Science will be better at curing things but the prices for that will be high. You can barely get cold medicine without breaking the bank so I can only imagine how much all this is. I need to see some predictions for finances before 2050.
We are living in the Last Days folks, get right with Jesus Christ, he died on the cross for you, so you can be forgiven of your sins, and have eternal life. No one is promised tomorrow, Call on the name of Jesus to be saved.   For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. (Romans 6:23)
I'll be 53 2050 lol. Im 22 yrs old now
Anyone watching this on 2025
Is anyone else looking forward to a mini ice age? #globalwarmingsucks
cant wait to go to the future
2019 world war lll
The human race is amazing
I'll come back to check in 2050.
Human will evolve again and more advance than ever
i will still be alive by 2050
This is fake! Unless you are GOD! You don’t know what will happen.
3:11 im using ipad rn hehe
And this is why you shouldn't use drugs my friends
zoo without cages ok...
Your mom will also be your dad.        Oh, yeah.. that’s already happening. Like this for the Dads that are still in their children’s life.
I think it's more reducing the reaction time more than increasing it.. unless you use it one enemies.
I could have predicted some of these things lol
THE ASTRONAUT
Right now, Siri and Alexa is reminding us about everything we tell them to. 2050 they’ll be telling us what to do. By 2100 they won’t need us to do anything, and they may get rid of us altogether! We may be biological trash in the future. How bad do we need our tech?
Oh wow it’s the bright side of clickbait they loooove to clickbait their thumbnails😑
7:11 "The probability of an astronaut" XD
Can people plz stop shitting out babies
Did you forget about that the nerve gear might be created?
Fake
What will quantum teleportation be like, you never did say you just said an awful joke and kept going
none thinking of the future scarys me
Karnye west will run for president in 2020
In all seriousness, there's one thing that isn't being considered here: overpopulation. The population will just keep growing within a finite space with finite resources and everything will be just fine, right? Yeah, that's how reality works.
2018: "Here are all the things that will happen in the future." 2019: The universe implodes.
All of this will happen but if World War 3 doesn't come
U forgot world war 3
Like this comment if you think your cool.
Half this stuff won't even happen..
why did I click on this? ugh
i dont think it will be true any of these
Everyday we come closer to extinction...
Lol only 8billion people I thought its already 58billion lol
India is going to take over the internet so I guess I need to start going to the library and socialising with actual real life people
XDDD OMFG STARBUCKS
Yummy
Reasons I don’t watch these type of videos 1. It makes kid who have a bright future into panic 2. This is one of the cause of social suicide(never be on the internet again) 3. These prediction will usually be false 4. Even if its right, just let them live their lives happily without worries
Did they say “Norway will even ban gas powered cars” I live in Norway
good thing i'll be only about 50 in 2050
Best video bro
Load of hogwash, they can't go to space, they never landed on the moon and they will NEVER get to mars, they are luminaries in the firmament, the lies and deceit is rampant, but that's one thing I know... the lies and deception will continue and possibly increase, now you can take THAT to the bank.
In 2051, I will be laughing looking at this video. 😂
I am afraid to see the world in 2050. I hope our planet would return back to the good and pure times of the 20th century....
add extra 100 years on 2050 coz humans not smart as 100 years ago :)
2050
I mean, humans could hop galaxies if we are smart enough, we could for billions of more years if humans stop being so stubborn, and put their recycables in the recyling bin :))
The world wont even be here in 2050
Nice voice.
Is it just me or does the narrator sound like SwaggerSouls?
I look forward to all of it <3
To be honest this video kinda creeps me out. I'm 13 and just thinking that by the time I'm only 45 all these things could happen
That's scary and disgusting. Humans are rubbish.
I’ll be alive in 2050!!! 😛😛😛
We aren't going to see past 2025. Sorry to be the bringer on bad news. On a side note, heaven will be an option.
It would be super nice if all of this can happen now instead of later on happening when I’m  old in my 60’s or 70’s 😭😭😭
Who's still watching in 1980?
I will be 92 in 2050 but technology is always interesting to me.  Looking forward to it all.
The thing is they said a asteroid will hit the Earth in 2029 but then they Carry on what will happen in 2030 like seriously? If a asteroid is gonna hit us theres no point of telling us what will happen in 2030 if we are going to be dead well hopefully not

11:29 I really expected to hear that 50% of world's population will turn to dust...
How about a future where area 51 or the government comes clean about Aliens?
this is cyberpunk 2077
elon said colonization start at 2019 or 2020
Is everyone who commented on this video in middle school? Jeez...
Is this real??? 😢😨😕
I just want technology to advance to the point where I am able to get my self transferred into a computer/robotic body.
So scary.
Will the whole world be  mutated into a cyber planet
Happy new year 2050 I'm the 1st to say it.
1:14-1:44 maybe Catalonia
When I heard about the brain implant that could restore brain damage, I instantly started crying.   When I was 15 I sufferd from 3 cerebral infarcts and because of that I have spasms every time of the day. Nothing so far has helped to cure it, so I always said 'the only thing that could help me is an implant'.   So for me its definitely the brain implant!
I'm due to retire around 2045 so I want to live long enough to reach that age and see the Singularity whatever it transpires to be. it sounds like fun. and I'll be young enough to experience it before succumbing to advanced old age. hopefully I will be able to afford it!
not at  twenty 50 but at some point their will be a over population
the probability of the astronaut colliding with Earth ... :P
Who’s watching in 2050 ? :))
in 2050 humans will be twice as lazy .
mini ice age!
Kurdistan/Iraq is one of them too
alien too will be with us 2050 ...
BRIGHT SIDE YOUTUBE CHANNEL WILL REACH 10 BILLION SUBSCRIBERS, WOOAH.
I actually think these predictions are pretty accurate. And no joke, the things that are to come are pretty alarming.
Hopefully they create a time machine
WO
gosh dangit Detroit become human will be upon us in between 2040 and 2050
Wait what about the hover cars I can Star Wars?
But in the year 2000 will we have automatic wabbit blasters??
I want to be like ghost in the shell
The future is a scary place and I don’t feel comfortable living in it. But hopefully it will be fine
I thank thar is going to be a the 100 show thing
Colanize on Mars yeah let's all anger Mars hahaha lol
Nothing is going happen :/
In the year 2050 will the internet finally be free to access?
We kinda need a mini ice Age not a giant one though
The first space hotel, wifi charging, Auroa, And Alfa Centauri Star System
Detroid:Became Human won't be just a game....
I really don't want to be alive when the world ends😫
Nah,I really don't think God'll let ALL of these happen😁
What the duck he is so wroung
I am most likely going to live throu all of this because I am 10
There’s already zoos like that
In year 2050 Apple will finally introduce a MICRO SD slot in their iPhone XYZ
I'll goo living in the woods TOMORROW
pls no mini ice age
The only thing I want that should happen in the future is everyone living like one family with zero toxicity. all the other technological advancements are pointless if we cant achieve this. And also to avoid populating the earth so animals get a chance to evolve too.
Sounds like an episode of Black Mirror to me
Nothing predicted interests me. I hope that meteor hits us
I don't want a robotic future. The only good time on earth is what I imagine the 90's were like... But as the 2000's came, humanity's intelligence went COMPLETELY downhill...
I hope ill get a like by 2050 ill like my own because no-one else will :(
Will get worse, but caveman to mordern day hasn't changed at all still go clubbing for chicks dont you
I agree!
To move to mars! 100% but i hope its as early as 2025 or 2030 come on nasa do your work
I don’t want my Kids to live in such timesl, the first 10 years were okay but after that it just gets creepy
Now in 2018 I already experience radio waves signal from faraway. I cannot confirm because I am a schizophrenia patient. Maybe you can explain. I am from Singapore.
This video stresses me tf out
You don't have a clue.
In 2050 I'll be 45 im 13 now and I was born in 2005
Wait, what?  "The probability of the ASTRONAUT colliding with earth in 2029 was 2.7%"?  Someone forgot to fix that in editing, but I guess thats what the text on the screen was for, LOL!
The "astronaut" colliding with earth at 7:11
maybe sounds weird but to reduce the population there must be a war... to reduce it or just every family gets 1 child max 2. . sound weird to say but its an sollution
An RFID-Chip rammed up our arses!!!!....
I’m already gonna be in mexico
by 2050 china will control the world
I be 69 a great grandparent like the 80s kids we will be antiques my eldest  son will be almost 50 my young one will be almost 40 cool damm and 2050 this comment will be still here
I'm looking forward to seeing the end of permanent paralysis and traumatic brain injuries.
If we have a mini ice age would that increase the ice offsetting the melting?
I think you missed a crucial event, America will not exists then. At least not the way we know it.
That's if the rapture doesn't occur before
I’ve been watching videos like this and stuff like ‘what will end the world’ and I’m terrified yay
"well have flying cars in 2015" nope "we will have genetic modification robotic implants and perfect VR in 2018" nope close tho but "well have Colony on Mars in 2020" nope space X and NASA are holding off a few more years to design and build rockets and Usa thinks it's to much money
I swear BRIGHT SIDE is watchmojo.com all over again but %100000 more cancer
If you think about it, this could all probably never happen  Like if u agree
my favourite prediction is teleportation
In 2036 bionic eyes are you serious if you are I am so happy my dad can finally see with 2 eyes after 67 years of seeing with one eye and I will be 31.
construction of tallest building here in jeddah was stop....
OMG  my life is ruined, I want a different future.
have of this stuff is not going to come true sorry :b
2:43 The Jeddah Tower is going to be hit with a plane  It's a subliminal message!!
The first space hotel? Yeah, right!!!
7:11 u said astronaut, instead of asteroid
Stop scaring us, this is fake
I'm 10 years old and i'm scared
Hopefully WW3 and the end of the world
I used to live in Dubai and went to the top of Burj khalifa a lot. Yay India does it!
People are doing very wrong in this time and thats why the world will look like this.
a zoo without cages?? sounds like the NATIONAL PARKS THAT ARE FOUND ALL OVER AFRICA!!!!
The last thing we need is a 1 billion increase in population and a even longer life expectancy...
Thanks. It's nice to know about the future.  God bless, Proverbs 3`
Thanks. It's nice to know about the future.  God bless, Proverbs 31

This is all creepy but who knows if this will all be true.
This is all creepy but who knows if this will all be true.
This is Sarah, she is 0 years old.

Edit 3: SHE'S DEAD. NOW LETS SEE HOW MANY MORE LIKES SHE GETS, THE MORE PEOPLE SHE GETS TO COME TO HHER FUNERAL.
We will all nuke each other to death before 2050 😂😂😂. Humans have a history of not being able to get along.
I personally think that most of this stuff will fail and charging phones with wi-fi definatly wont work
Doesn’t seem to bad
I actually wish I wont see the disgusting future humans are planing to this pour little planet
7:12 did he say astronaut?? xD
Jesus died and rose from death to give us eternal life, even tho we do not deserve it.
Jesus loves you
I hope dragon ball will still last in the future🙏🏻😖
Nasa????
Each year I get more scared
Wowww...lots of great advancements in human life and technology and medical field and life on another planet ..mars 🤓👍🏻🧠☄️🚀🛸🛰
This was sick
We wont colonize Mars for another 150 years!
OOOOH FUTURE YAY

Unimportants

I almost cried when the video was done. I just wish time could stay still nowadays
Hopefully people will make REAL working portal guns
The "astronaut" colliding with earth? Anyone else catch that?
In 2050 a black paluted world
How about "it's just 20 years away" Fusion power? How about the increasing number of antibiotic-resistant disease organisms? Let's skip ahead a tad: what will happen by Y3K? (Is the world of "Futurama" possible?)
Us poor people won't be able to have any of this. Only rich can I'm sure 😏
In 2050 imma be 45
I hope the mini ice age happens bec
Is this the second fastest growing subscribed youtube channel? The first one is T-series.
LOL
DINOSAURS
You don't know any of this; for all we know, the end of all life as we know it may be changed from billions to dozens of years, or even days if things go horribly wrong; this is called Chaos Theory
... So... God puts them on earth 🌎 and they decide to move to a new planet. Human beings are intelligent.
The future seems freaky
How do y’all know ur not the future scientist could be wrong
Judging from the last past 50 years...Not !
HI
I look forward to the bionic eyes
People will be able to get high thru wi-fi.
7:10 The astronaut? Don’t you mean the astroid 😂
Oooh I can’t wait till we can charge our phones with WiFi!!!
02:52, but not enough toilets apparently.
I don't like the idea of living in a totally electronic world :/  I was born in 1988 and still adjusting to how the world has become so reliant on technology....heck I still remember when the first smart phone came out and the first flat screens(they were plasma)came out...
what about the population cap in 2050.
Wheres all the sources for these claims?
We should not forget the WW3 tha will start at 2021-2025
7:11 it's asteroid not astronaut
Bright side will hit 20 million subscribers in 2019
On 2050 im gonna be 56 years old .. I wish I can Reach that Age. And Watch this Video again in Exact date , hey BRIGHTSIDE channel would you notify me on that said year. I AM going to expected this From Your Channel. -  _ Can You?
How do you know thats 100% fake and it wont happen in 2050
Thanks for informing me how old I’m gonna be before these things come 😥
Self-driving cars are merely impossible to create since a system has to decide what to do in certain circumstances, instead of the human driver. Every person on Earth has a different view on ethics, you cannot make a system around it. You would have create such advanced technological terrors that it would be highly inefficient. Decision you make are based on your mood (how have you slept, what did you eat for breakfast, did you like it, how late did you eat?) which has to do with your gut, and on previous memories you have. It's unethical to let a system decide fate. That is why we shouldn't long for self-driving cars, and why the EU will probably not allow these cars within its borders.
I see humans become Detroit in 2050
2050 50% of India will be online shooting zombies.2051 the real zombie apocalypse 😂
Brain imprints for mind control And surveillance
Also, according to the Earth Happiness test, the current generation of young teens and tweenies believe that thier lives won't be as good as thier parents. This means that children nowadays believe that the lives they will lead into adulthood won't be better or equal to thier parents. This is the first time children have believed this since the world wars.
6:30 What will the water raise? (Or do you mean rise?)
5:00 Why would you want to increase a soldier's reaction time?
HOW DO YOU KNOW THIS ARE YOU LIKE THE BRIGHT SIDE GOD!! (no offence im Muslim to)
I’m not too happy about the uk ban on diesel +petrol cars in 2040, I won’t be able to fuel my evo 6
Why does the tesla car have a face

the colonization of Mars
Anyone else worried about that ice age?
Google funding the internet to be a lot faster😍
I hope 2045 will not become world war 3
I am not excited about my future.
OMG YOU MAKE ME SCERD BUT THANS FAKE
I'm excited because then my mom wouldn't be there to tell my I can't kiss that one girl
Omg I can't wait for phones always being charged by WiFi Look ma no wire!
Will I even survive that long...
they should focus on cancer
Good computer and smartphone graphics
This video makes me want to stay in 2018
I hope that they will find aliens
bionic eyes
"It will be possible to charge electrical devices using wifi..." Uhh how? Unless you wanna have thor lighting bolts shooting into your phone i really dont think thats gonna be possible, or safe.....
NOBODY knows whats going to happen in the future not even the scientist! they will work super hard but they DO NOT have the right answers to the future! to be exact the only person that knows whats going to happen in the future is THE PEOPLE IN HEAVEN!
In 2050 I will be 44 nice 👍👍👍
Will the the rock actually hit us I’m confused???
7:10 astronaut?
I did the math and speculated that by the year 2050 I will be 49 years old. I am currently 17. in the year 2053 I will be 52.  That's still relatively young plus the fact that the human lifespan will be lengthened tremendously. well excluding disease and cancer or unexpected accidents.  Aside from all that I am excited to be able to witness all of these predictions if they come to fruition and it is very interesting.
i’m so scared for my children
11:28 *This Will Happen bcoz of u* _just kidding lol_
3:02 that means there will more of these scam centers lol
like if you are from denmark      2:03
Watching at 2050                Sike that's the wrong number
In 2050 i can say back in my day whe used to walk and whe could not go on vacation in space and whe needed to donate organs and drive with gas and my kids then say but gas can axolode its dangerous and i say it never did i  my day
Cool clickbait
Will we turn into a supersaiyan?
Year 2050 ill be 53yo :O
9/11 will be solved
What about Syria ?
One thing you can’t predict, Nature disasters by 2050.
I don't think cities will get that large; I believe that in the next thirty years, it will become too expensive for most people to live in the major cities-and go the way of San Francisco.
I wish dat people will not make more babies so we wont be overpopulated if we get overpopulated call Thanos
That wifi will charge up your phone i would be 25 when that happens
I hope Google makes Internet 1000x faster!!!!! I <3 that when it happens ! :)  like this  if u  want it to happen that in Earth
What will happen in 2050? Idk I dont have 2050 vision
like if you are watching this video in 2035
this is wack. humans can’t destroy the earth and then move to mars, just to destroy that planet too. it’s weird to think, that if all the missions to mars succeed, in a few thousand years mars will be how earth is now. then humans are gonna move to another planet to destroy.
spammer dont scare us
You put a plane going past a tower in Saudi Arabia 💀😂
This basically says the government is gonna end the word
it scares me there turning inacent army solider people into robots
Predictions form a human standpoint are like 1000 opinions trying to compete with one fact. Once again I say what one individual will do for comments and likes. But the video was well scripted LOL
7:12 astronaut?
In 2036 I'm gonna still be alive and suffer. I'll also be 30
7:17 the astronaut
I just hope I'll be dead by the time this happens...
All we need now is for everyone to go back to 80’s style and then cyberpunk 2077 will be reality.
2026 sound lovely
I'll be 48
But will Rock music make a comeback?
Why can't our lives just stay put right here insted of having crazy things happening in the future, Who knows what will happen.
mini ice age.......
Year 2045 Minecraft will finally be completed and it will look like real life and the name of mine craft will be realcraft and everything wont be only cubes there will be circles triangles and other things... Also roblox will be looking like real life too and it will be easier to create games.
I'D LOVE TO EXPERIENCE THE NEW CONTACT LENS WITH A CAMERA.
You forgot about by 2050 the rainforest will be gone thx to de-forestation
A plane will fly into the Jeddah  tower 2020
in year 2050 I will buy my first phone Nokia
I never dream of seeing the future :(
I hope that the big building wont turn out like 7/11 :/
I hope despacito 2 will be relesed by then
In 2028 my passport will expire
I think from 2035 expectations are exaggerated.  yeah might just be me but I'm pretty sure it'll turn out like the flying skateboard in back to the future.
Dang it I'll be alive I'll only be 82.🤔😥
Pewdiepie will no longer the most subscribed youtuber
we not gonna get that far
Earth won’t even be the earth anymore, It’ll all be artificial -.- smh I don’t wanna live in TTHAAATTTT
This is really scary. I dont want a too futuristic world. :(
*ooh that’s next year* I’m wheezing.
No body can reach mars or any where untill god let us so dont think about such foolish things hehe
id still be alive lol, trust me, ill be on mars, YOU WILL SEE
this isn't true, because it is a "idea" thought by them
bright side stop lying for views
,, A man mission will to Mars will start and it will be called,, aurora". " Me remembering ,, subnautica": mabie rename it for better luck...      Sorry if this is cringe.
right now i am 7 plz don't judge just plz
omg all of them cant wait
who's watching in 2020
Bruh what would sports be like? :/
Electric cars are cool but my concern is how are the gas companies going to react to a total takeover of electric cars?  Not favorably I would imagine.  My guess is that they will either seize control of electric charging stations or they will attempt to crush the electric car industry all together.
I'm only 17. so I'll keep you guys updated on this
I Thought Than Human Life is Going To Ruined By Themselves. But i think its 34% True Now. Not 100%
I hope a asteroid dosent hit earth
Going to be 48 years old in 2050 that’s crazy
Looks bright to me
I hope the asteroid dosent hit earth In 2050
I don’t want the Artic ocean to melt
Mini ice age, looks like fun for us here in Asia lol
Getting rid of my autism
7:36 Detroit: Become human.
I think you watch to many movies man
We'll all set off a big firework display, just like we did for the turn of the century.
9:37 Travelling at 1/5 of light speed? Not going to happen...
7:11 "the probability of the ASTRONAUT colliding with Earth..."
All I know is you should not have any room to speak.
The black population would have also dwindled to just above zero.
JFK's death was already revealed...
end time
Wifi
World war 3
I want Teleport to Lumbridge
Really i have to wait until i’m fifty to experience the colonization of mars
this is just what they hope will happen by then.
I know how to get to Mars, just take a book read and Walla
At 7:13 you said astronaut instead of asteroid
I am looking forward to computers like what Tony Stark had in the movie Iron Man where the screens are up in the air & u can interact with it with ur hand & fingers like what he did so I hope that will also be in our future
I just wanna know when Flying broomsticks and Quidditch will be invented. Along with electric sticks that connect to your phone, are voice activated, and make things happen in the real world when you say Harry Potter spells!
7:11 “the probability of the astronaut colliding with earth”
Thank God I need more internet
7:11 He said "astronaut" instead of "asteroid"
Yet we still can’t have a Back to the Future hover board
Let's see how accurate these predictions are. I wonder if by 2050, there's a fountain of youth?
I wanna see if they are magic or superpower at 3000 year later
I want to go to space, i wanna see for myself
I  got hearing disabilith
Very interesting
Well Africa stays the same... well atleast for some of these predictions
*2038* *insert all DBH fans*
Brain uploading and all the ethical consequences which come with that?
Okay for one, not everyone of those people will be lined up at starbucks considering Mormons exist and don't drink coffee. and second, it's going to be hard to predict the global population with all the mass shootings going on.
I will be 32 in 2050
Im only 10, so Im really excited. :D
Umm I'm not scared god won't let this happen
Just watch the movie "Wall-E", that's basically what will happen. lol, just kidding... or am I...
They have to figure out how to get to the Moon first. Mars is much much further and NASA is busted for lying to the human race!l lool.
someone told me that after saudi araibia does break that record,cause ya know i I've here un dubai,uae will beat that
We are killing this world... technology  is dangerous
Really
And yet we cant minimize youtube to listen to music...

That 'contact lenses will have built in cameras' is just scary. You don't know who could be taking photos of you
Nice inside 🙂
"The probability of the astronaut colliding..." 7:12 approx. Do you mean asteroid?
colonisation on Mars.....waiting for it to happen
Meanwhile back in 1985 people thought that by now we would have flying cars
2050 not ready to get old
I WANNA GO TO MARS
I hope for byonic eyes
What will happen in 2050?????!        1: Beta males will take over and REAL men will be thought of as wierdos.    2: Jesus Christ will return shortly after that year, if he hasn't already.    3: as mentioned before, the weak beta males will take over, and flannel and workin clothes will be thought of as a disgusting presentation.
*What about Natural Disasters which can engulf 1/2 of the human?*
BLA , BLA...............CLEAN UR MOUTH!!!
Global overpopulation will cause a Third World War for the sake of mankind’s future. Very few will survive & technology will take a step back. Peace will prevail throughout the World & it will be a new beginning. That’s my thoughts.
Probably a world war somewhere in there too, but we know good ol USA gonna win
I am from 2069 please stop dumping garbage oh and world war 3 starts soon so bye
7:12 Oh no, the astronaut's going to hit the Earth!  Edit; going to collide*

At least robots won’t take over the world completely
bright side I really wanna where you get your amazing facts makes they are simple amazing. Ohh u forget to mention the fact in 2030 will be the 100th celebration of the world cup in either Uruguay, Argentina or Paraguay

No wrinkles!!!!!!!!!!! Yay!!!!!!!
I don't wanna live in the future anymore... But I'm only twelve 😭
my imagination of 2050 is there will be flying cars and cars that can drive by itself
the past and future are only concepts, thoughts within the brain, it is always the present moment, the now
mos of his scares me
If the mini ice age actually happens will there be Eskimo training videos?
I'm assuming these aren't just random predictions and they have some kind of evidential backing. Regardless, I'm looking forward to it!
i love the futer and you know wath i was born in 2010 so im probely gona be alive yayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy baby im gona be on my lectronecs maby move to mars OOOOMG
I am always right 😂. What I  dream seems to be what ppl talk in the future about. But I'm saving my self while I can. Rest of ya can have fun...
I think u meant decreasing reaction time for soldiers
Oh man, we are so smart and progressive ! Imagine what Millenials are gonna see. I think millenials' lifespan is the most interesting one
DISGUSTANG
I think he meant chick-Fila
Norway is evil, produces oil and encourage other countries to buy it while planning to ban motorised engine in 2025.
This is pretty scary actually.....our world will be so much like the game "Detroit: Become Human" I think the only thing i look forward too is cures for diseases..
I mean I love the cold but not to the point where I want an ice age. COME ON OBAMA
I cant wait
Орел и ореска ани били в всех странов но не в холодний странох

I just look forward to having a boyfriend and kids
Correction at 7:12 ".. probability of the astroid*.." I think I heard astronaut?
technology is getting bigger and bigger yet computer science is still isn't in the curriculum. we are shaping the world and people just call us "hacker" and "addicted to computers"
Cant wait
Somtimes i See the futer in my dreams its very creepy
I DON'T WANNA BE A ROBOTT!!!! AND I DON'T WANT TECHNOLOGY TO BE ADVANCED!!  ITS A BIG NO,NO FOR ME!!

And New Zealand will be predator free after its poisoned everything with 1080 poison
How do you know all of this is not even 2050 can someone tell me im confused
World War iii, drought and famine are more likely to happen by 2050 than anything on this list.
So is this the bright side ?
or world war 3

90s kids would become Grandpas and Grandmas.
Self driving cars already happened
I won't be alive , good luck in the future.
Looking forward to technological advancements! Woo hoo.
A mini ice age would be good?? It could help global warming a bit
Let's see in the future right or wrong
A lot in just 3-4 years
I wish the world could just stay like it is now
Re routing of nerves, curing paralysis and curing deafness.
You forgot about the meteorite that will probably hit earth in 2019
Don't listen to this. Are u god or something that u can c the future!! LOL!!
in 2019 mcr is getting back together heh
In the future we will all be in peace and everything will be free and we will all be vegan and adopt weird pets and read each others mind...we will start trying to be 4th density in 2020 and a few more things but I cannot say it...but it’s not horrible...I’m just not aloud to say the rest...but u would already know if u watch a secret web but not everyone can access and I don’t want the government getting mad so I can’t say the name of the website sorry. If u wanna see  the website u cannot freak out and not be scared. Not everyone has access to it but if u know what the web site is called don’t say it please cause nobody wants to be taken by the government. I may not had proof but I know it’s real I guys don’t need to believe me..or think I’m crazy 😑
I'll be 50 years old
I swear if pets go extinct in the future sucide will be my choice
Red Hat
I don't like how the world will look like in 2050
All pretty neat except that Starbucks will be going belly up in the next two years
Why BAN GAS POWERERD CARS ;-; NORWAY WHY!?!?!?!? IM an norwegian
Increasing reaction time? That’s not a good thing.
There going to build a new big amusement park in arizona
And then the Cylons take over! Lol
Mini ice age
The Jeddah Tower
I’m Afraid the information in your mind will go to the wrong hands
I don’t want mind readers in the future
I dream about a picture in my mind that will happen the next day then when I see someone doing something I remembered it from my dream but now it doesn’t really happen anymore just the next day I remember someone doing the same thing somewhere but I don’t remember it in my dream
Only God holds the future in his hands and he knows what’s going to happen matter of fact he already knows it’s funny how some people think their god.
We already have zoos with no cages.     The San Diego Wild Animal Park opened in 1972 and I am sure there are others.
Im waiting for Babylon5 to be real more likely than stare wars or star trek ha ha ha maybe in my life time Ill only be 65 in 2050
It looks like a good future for Starbucks
I don’t look forward to anything except the colonization of mars
The new species of human will be robo sapian
Oh my god in 2019 I will turn 14 😱😱
I literally do not want to live on this planet anymore
i love the future this video is awesome?
at least fortnite will be R.I.P😈
My imagination of the world in the year 2050 would be that GTA 6 finally comes out.
And in the Year 2078 Roblob bloxburg will finally have a pet update!
So we are slowly becoming cyborgs.
What I want in the future is that people stop throwing thrash in the water
in the year 2050 our parents would finally understand that online games cant be paused
in the year 2023 i will be 18 yrs old
This kept making me think about my death 😥
what about flying cars and shortage of antibiotic for new microbes strain?
I’ll be 43
I'm 15 ima be alive BRITCHES 😝😝
I like it when stuff changes. I want the world to be as futuristic as possible. I want to be friends with an anthromorphic android
Sorry but some possible but when it comes to health never happen there's a cure for cancer but no company will sponsor it cause they will lose money big businesses control new tech so keep dreaming any new tech they will lose money from won't happen oh by the way u remember the car that ran on water the inventor was killed
I predict there will be a pandemic that will wipe out at least half the world's population before 2050
Everything's going to be the same and we're just going to have better phones
Am I the only one who's looking forward to the future?
The time traveler was right .
Fighting Bots.
Most likely won’t all happen - people in 1950 though humans would be able to fly by 2000
Mars
So noone is gonna talk about the *ASTRONAUT* colliding with Earth (7:12)
Wow technology is really going to improve although I'm worried about the environment will it still be the same after all of this??!!??
i love this video its rea̺̲ͅlly good
Nowadays I'm to cold for girlfriend
In the year 2525 If man is still alive

Mini ice age? I'm so down dude.
There already is a zoo without cages its called safari park
2025 WiFi charging..wonder what the cancer rate will be then?
they forgot about ww3 and most population will be gone
By the time it's 2050 ill be 48. Not the worst age to be then. Although if I want to see the year 2100 ill need to live to be 98 at least.
*slow clap*
Google being quicker
sounds pretty much like bulshit
The socialist and communist governments around the world will prevent all of these predictions from coming true.
JESUS HELP US ALL!
All I can say about this predicted future is; Ew.
I don't know why but I felt scared.
All people will become mad and fight each other and killing ,the world full of blood
To get to the mars immediately
I'm scared of future now
I will be 45 years old
apple products will cost millions or billions

If we can fix our senses by the click of a button, nobody would suffer shortsightedness. I wish this happened now so I could see further...

These are all opinions
Earth will go to war with Acnoficoscathethecnoparactilus
Like me if u could never do all that research......And comment...sub to me and bright guy......also Mythical Gamers
I Want To See The Future Is Very Nice Like It Had New Gadgets That Unchargable
Imagine when we will all be so advanced that androids will take over every job in the world and we will never need to work. Kids in the future will be like "Hey grandma/grandpa, will you tell me about money? What was it like?"
Hopefully there will be a cure for cancer.
Mars colonisation
Ill be 45 by 2050 so i can enjoy my life😁😁😁
I would think their will be a major water shortage by 2050.
I wonder what people in 2050 will think of this video
i hope the singularity comes! then i can download the search engine that is the smartest! and i will also download norton security on my cyborg armor! then i could be the smartest person in the world!
google making their wifi 1000x times faster? lets go :D
In 2051 the third war will happen
Bro I’m lowkey scared of the future because global warming is going to wipe out the world and we are gonna have to hope we can find out a way to live on mars
I have a few comments here: 1.) How do he figure all this stuff out? Clearly he either knows things that we don't or is networking with someone who does. 2.) This guys tone and presintation scares me. He just reports the facts like its all fine and dandy with us having a mini ice age in 2035? Thats serious and this guy doesn't even care, its concerning... Thanks for sharing BRIGHT SIDE I guess..
I hope that in my lifetime from my husband that they find a cure for Paralyzed people

Why do we have to predict the future, The only thing that we will only predict or not is the present time of our years and we will have to wait until someone's prediction are correct or not
Today is that Jetson like future; not 32 years from now!
You forgot the UK leaving the EU.

Funny thing is we won't live to 2050
AN ASTROID JUST HIT ON SABAH
2045  TECHS EVERYWHERE! I NEED A ROBOT ARM IM SERIOUS FOR MY LEFT HAND ;w;
what if the future end December 25 and all is lost     JK
Why does Starbuckrogers coffee taste like Burnt water . Who said they are the best?
Any of this assumes super productive economic growth... But the unsustainable economic bomb we are building must result in major depression recession unemployment, economic slowdown...so yes this is about the 'bright side' of life, but more realistically, things will progress a lot slower than proposed in an ideal world, which we dont live in. Im hoping humanity will think more about happiness and less about technogical growth... although i couldnt live without my phone ha ha...Dang, we are all doomed
Teleportation? Finally usain bolts record is gonna be beaten😂😂
Life in general, scares me. But I deal with it nevertheless.
Bouganville island sounds like a good idea. for them, make A LOT OF CANADIANS HAPPY.then they can make tHeir own laws and go back to their old ways ,PUT SOME BUFFALOES ON THE ISLAND, THEYRE ALL SET.
The present lawless depravity of the world will urge Jesus Christ to return before mankind destroys itself. Check the last book in your Bible. (if U have one!)
I look forward to a vegan world and a more tolerant one, less transphobic and racist.

Uhh what does a mini ice age look like
Fusion?
Who else is gonna wait till 2050 and watch this video again
Buhay pa si Cardo?
Not to brag or anything I live in Dubai and they have announced that they will build a tower taller than burj Khalifa and the others it will probably be ready by 2021
The only reason for me to keep living is to see the future
7:12 you said astronaut lol.
Il leave a sign that i was alive
Its funny that Every single person will have a cell phone with them, yet not a single person even thinks that maybe there is a reason they want us all walking around staring at their phones...
Going to Mars!
They turning us into mindless robots.
I cannot wait until WiFi charges devices!!!
In 2020 in the uk you will no longer be able to get plastic straws anywhere

It was proven that the CIA had involvement in JFK's assassination, is pretty much common sense he was killed because he wanted to get rid of The Federal Reserve.
I don't like change

well I always say anything is possible
7:11 don't you mean ~asteroid~ 🤔
I’m 49 now, I’ll probably be dead, or I’ll be 81.
32 years...nothing much.
Woah that’s slightly terrifying.
You say "in 2019 Denmark will be the first to open a zoo without cages".......The San Diego Zoological Society began developing the Wild Animal Park in 1964.  The proposal would differ significantly from that of a typical zoo in that animals are exhibited in a natural environment rather than in cages.  The Wild Animal Park opened in 1972 North of San Diego.  The name was changed to the San Diego Zoo Safari Park in 2010.
Feet, Miles - Oh that's right the United States of America hasn't joined the 96% of the planet using the Metric system of measurement. I wonder if that will happen before 2050?

i just wish the internet gets 1000 times faster
I’m pretty sure in like 20,000 years aliens will be with us
im looking forward to none of them especially it asteroid one
What will happen is all of the weak hearted and feeble minded will happily and foolishly give away more of their personal power and rights, mega corps will be the only businesses and will be unstoppable, and a few big earthquakes will rock the western united states, and tsunamis might wipe out Japan worse than their low birth rate. That wasnt a joke, they have been in an reverse baby boom for decades. T.T
Since when did you know this stuff? This brings anxiety to people
Why is he acting like all this is amazing
This makes me so sad…
I hope they make a time machine soon so I can go back in time
Very naive propaganda
Looking foreword to the end of da world😂
What about the cure to cancer?
I look forward to anything in 2050 as I will be in my hundredth year then!
11:01 oh no
Wait lol I thought Elon Musk was an actor, not a business founder?

About that astoniod that is coming so close to Earth I have to think about that
In the year 2050, we will finally get the book Winds of Winter from George RR Martin. Just Mayb it will have A Dream of Spring too?   Who knows? I will b dead by 2050
I think in 2050 the world will be 85% females, or even more
I think we are waisting time building things we don’t need and soon robots you built will rule the world. This is scary.
I'll live to see all of it
Hemsoulds like the guy from Arnold
Non of them , because I can garantee you for 2050 nothing of that will happend only the wifi, google and the buildings the rest everybody can forget about it
we will see
Mars
Why stop at the year 2050? Let's broaden our perspective and take it out a lot further. Here are my predictions for the upcoming centuries:  In the year 2525, if man is stil alive, if woman can survive, they may find:  In the year 3535, ain't gonna need to tell the truth, tell no lies. Everything you think, do and say, is in the pill you took today.  In the year 4545, ain't gonna need your teeth, won't need your eyes. You won't find a thing to chew. Nobody's gonna look at you.  In the year 5555,  your arms are hanging limp at your sides. Your legs got nothing to do. Some machine's doing that for you.  In the year 6565, aint gonna need no husband, won't need no wife. You'll pick your son, pick your daughter too, from the bottom of a long glass tube.   In the year 7510, if God's a comin', he oughta make it by then. Maybe he'll look around himself and say, "Guess it's time for the judgment day".  In the year 8510, God is gonna shake his mighty head. He'll either say "I'm pleased where man has been", or tear it down, and start again.  In the year 9595, I'm kinda wondering if man is gonna be alive. He's taken everything this old earth can give, and he ain't put back nothing.  Now its been ten thousand years. Man has cried a billion tears. For what he never knew. Now man's reign is through. But through eternal light. The twinkling of starlight. So very far away. Maybe it's only yesterday....
A private European company is already planning colonization of Mars by 2027.  It's the Mars One project...maybe you got the dates wrong?  Also you must be from the West Coast, the East Coast prefers "Dunkin Donuts" LOL
What happen in our next life
Mars one event
6:44 I can finally take a photo of my crush secretly.
In 2070 the road in my street will finally be fixed
Nanomachines son!   They harden in response to physical trauma
0-0
so basically technology is going to turn the already dystopian earth into more of a dystopia?
I don't want to live in a futuristic society
Contacts lens is not healthy for anyone.
Who else skipped starting just to see 2050?
at that year 2050 i will be 77 yrs old hehe
"Have you ever dreamed of being able to see the future?"   me: lol no i only dream about the titanic and harry potter

Will I live...?.... Am I just a sock?... Will I ever find love.....? ....will I be forever alone....?   I'm sure about that ....uwu
idk that seems way to amibtious
I do hope we don’t do all of these things, it’s just completely terrible! I think we should just enjoy what we’ve got, it works good enough for us all anyways, we shouldn’t be trying to go into space but instead, going to the bottom of the ocean and exploring this amazing planet!
No I'm scared I don't wanna
Starbucks
in year 2030 a new Meme will be born !
I don’t want that future 😭

WHAT WE HUMANS DOING!!!!!!   We destroing earth planet
I wish someone predicted my future like that
In 2019 we are getting overwatch nerf guns
all of them
all of them
In a weird way I’m fine with a mini ice age....
The solution for androids taking over our jobs, leaving us a meaningless life is simple: becoming androids. I mean changing our own weak foolish useless brain with consious computers, and our ridiculous flesh and blood with robotic organs. This way, we WILL still have our jobs and be able to be as powerful as a supercomputer is.
No one knows the future only god does
I really want to see human starts to live on Mars
BS BS BS- we are almost in 2020, just 1 year and 4 months away from 2020 and I do not believe in 31 years and 4 months we will evolve THAT MUCH. First of all think of the resources, our planet is slowly dying because of how many things we destroy but don't put back. The truth is that the planet is made to sustain about 4 billion people according to the lifestyle that we have now (how much CO2 we produce and how much we destroy hour by hour) yet we are 7 billion, almost 8 of people... so guess what?! In about a few years we will either have to evolve to not use gas/oil for cars, not cut so many trees, recycle all the freaking plastic in nature etc. Either a war will start not for power but for the survival of the planet. To understand better search predictions from 2000 for 2020 and you will see we did NOT evolve as they thought we would. If we go on Mars it will be because the earth is almost dead not for some discovery. These predictions might happen but not in 31 years, maybe in 50-70 years. (my opinion)
2024 is the year I graduate
That is not 100% real
Seems like in the future all those people who have allergy for electricity will be dead  and bullying others in the internet will be easier if you can really take photos/ record with your contact lenses  (sorry if i spelt something wrong, I dont speak english)
"Are you sure about that?"
If I was in the future. I'm not marrying a robot human
When Google finnaly make the internet faster.
At 7:12, do any of you guys know which Astronaut is planning to collide with Earth? maybe one from Asia or India? lol
A mini ice age!
I am looking forward to the bionic eye
I feel we are flat and do not move
Help decrease population, Let's save water from now and get some missiles for Apopsis
Keep dreaming. By 2050 we will have like 5 more world wars that will reduce most of the world to slums. All of this stuff will be reserved for 1% of population.
7.11 - Yeahhhhhh...the 'astronaut' colliding with the earth. Ok.
2060... Fortnite 2 comes out and everything else stays the same
Flying cars
4:23 😁😁😁😁😁 More Humans😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
We wont have enough food for 9 mil people
THIS IS SO FUNNY BECAUSE GOD SAID HE WILL COME SOON TO TAKE THOSE WHO HAVE OBEYED HIS COMMANDMENTS BUT LEAVE THOSE WHO HAVE  THE MARK OF THE BEAST.
WRONG - solar energy will NEVER become more economical than traditional power sources of electricity - because it's not designed or intended to be.  There is not a single electrical engineer on the face of this planet that will tell you otherwise.  That's because the way how solar transference (how energy is created through a solar panel and turned into electricity) is "not designed" to be able to work with the current large electrical grid infrastructure to where it can contribute more than 15% of the total amount of power needed.  Even using home-solar systems to the max cannot create more than about 40% of the power needs for your own home - and that would mean have every square cm of your roof (if it's a big roof) covered with solar panels and most all of your front and rear yards (if you have them).  Of course, the size of the solar grid needed to transfer that much solar energy would be about the size of a RV - and where are you going to put that? (and it costs a fortune)  Again, go ask any electrical engineer.  I have a problem with all these "feel good" videos that simply skip over reality and absolute scientific fact!  My source:  I'm a licensed electrician and have installed numerous solar systems in both residential and commercial properties.  My suggestion:  convert everything to LNG and propane - it will easily achieve all the goals of the Paris Accord within ten years, and by the time all the LNG resources run out they should have hydrogen plant facilities perfected, as well as hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.  THAT is the future.
This is assuming that we dont fall victim to a nuclear apocalypse.
we can't have robots like humans because if we do one day it will do a Jurassic park
i only want the bionic eyes
this is all a lie no one knows whats going to happen in the next years
In 2025 ill be 21😂
Im scared of this time of future. It’s like humans will become less human in the next 30years. Chills down my spine.
The NWO will have completed stages of its mission. Because most people are oblivious to the agenda of nwo psychopaths. You will be under a dictatorship and love your tech implant under your skin and all because you were brainwashed not to think.
I'm scared of the future only cuz I will lose my mom🙁 But at the same time I'm also excited to see all the new things being built, invented,and made!
2033 the mission to mars name Aurora is form subnatica
Maybe. Getting the thing for never dying before the metior
7:10 The probability of the astronaut colliding into the Earth?
i hope we can fly in the future
Whasent the aurora. the space ship from subnautica
Really good analysis!
The future ain’t that bad
Brain implants and never being deaf and the eye chip thank God I'm only 19
I look forword to go on Mars
Great video but the jokes just ruin it
How do u know😎😎
you know most of this is actually completely valid... until you reach 2045 and this guy starts spewing bile ^^
When my daughter reaches 7 th grade she will have to learn again the tallest building in the world
Im saced wut doing to happen in 2050 😩😓😢
I will be 58 lol
What will happen in 2018 fool
how can u be sure this will happen???
7:08 did i heard "Probability of ASTRONAUT colliding with Earth"????? man you made great video but you should say Asteroid instead of Astronaut... lol Thanks for sharing anyway...
in 2029 the toys and games are invisible
AURORA , ARES close enough (Andy weir is going to be ecstatic in 2033) the book the Martian is set in 2035
I live in Dubai
Remember guys these may or may not happen
1:12 ooh thats next year        *if i watch this next year* no its this year
You forgot to mention the artificial intelligence. It's gonna be more than you told.
Oil is depleting.l. without oil, there is no electricity...There wont be plastic and pollution..  For mother earch 200 years is nothing. Earth is waiting by thinking that let people enjoy 100 or 200 years until the oil exhaust. Then things will normalize...  Oil is linked to food, electricity, research, etc... Without oil everything will stop..  Solar panels wont replace .. The future will become calm without any technologies.
Very lack on information
I hope that we can cure every disease.
If out world keeps polluting this ain't happening. If the world reaches 10 billion we won't be able to survive because there won't be anough food
Singularity 10:35
2029 will get earth destroy hit the earth come on come
I don't believe humans will live longer. The way people keep dying from sickness that keep happening more often and how people smoke, Vape, drink and take drugs, I think we are going to live less.
the main thing is controlling population!!!😐😐
In year 2050.... Well, one thing for sure, we're already old or died... Hope someone found a formula to stay young forever before 2030, but then new problem came with extreme overpopulation.......
If oswald killed Kennedy why all the secrecy about his death?
😇😇😇😇
I don’t think I care about these.

Isaiah 53:5, he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes, we are healed. For salvation, people just need to follow the way they did it in Acts? They were baptized in the water and of the spirit. Here's why! The gospel is the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. If we are to follow him, we must do the same thing. Death= repentance, Burial = baptism, and resurrection = being filled and rising again from the dead. That's what Acts 2:38 is. We must obey the gospel, 2 Thessalonians 1:8-9, in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that OBEY NOT THE GOSPEL of our Lord Jesus Christ... Matthew 7:21-23, Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of Heaven; but he that DOETH THE WILL OF MY FATHER which is in Heaven. St John 3:3-5, EXCEPT a man be born of WATER AND OF THE SPIRIT, he cannot enter into the kingdom of GOD. We can't come up with our own gospel. Galatians 1:8-9, But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. Don't be cursed. One way for all people. Jews, Gentiles, and Samaritan. Our salvation has to match-up with the scriptures and no scriptures on the subject can be taken away. Eternity is TOOO long to be WRONG! st John 5:39, Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me. The gospels show what Christ has done on the cross for us. The book of Acts shows us the beginning of Christ's Church and how to enter the Church, obeying Acts 2:38. The letters were written to the Church to show us how to behave now that we are born again into the Church. It's better to walk alone than to walk with a crowd going in the wrong direction. Are we supposed to follow the teachings of the apostles? Acts 2:42, They continued steadfastly in the apostle's doctrines. Ephesians 2:20, We are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone. Don't get Titus 3:5 mixed up with James 2:14-26, about WORKS. One is a WORK of your OWN RIGHTEOUSNESS OR GOOD DEEDS and the other is a WORK OF FAITH, Obedience to God's command. If you believe in this message, help spread it in the name of Jesus Christ so people can get saved the right way. God bless you!
Us humans don't deserve earth..
I don’t like this
You make videos for a living...  do you think you can learn to pronounce the words properly? Nuclear :  I know it's easier for Americans to pronounce New-kel-ear but it;s really pronounced Knew-clee-are...  maybe you can just get a narator.  At 15 million subscribers, we are paying for it by the adds we watch. Well, 14,999,999 now...
I’m hoping the astroid hits...

Wow so all this stuffs supposed to happen by the time I’m 48
Yes faster internet
Am I the only one who's really scared about the fact he said 50% of the population will suffer from Near sight?   That means 50% of the population will not have imagination. Do you know what that would do to technological advancement?
You don't  know  nothing  your just  making  up stuff

I’m sorry but Jesus will return soon
I hope beloved Jesus will come soon.
I love bright side because it tells us the future tells us what to do if you get bitten by something poisonous so I Love You Brightside
Later in the future, the Soviet Union will form again and join forces with China, later in October 2077, they will drop nukes on major American cities. A nuclear fallout will happen on that year. Register to a vault before this happens!
They are forgetting about the nuclear power plant shutdown...
Teleportation
Fast internet 😊
If we reach more than 9 billion people we will get a plagua
I liked wen he talked about the animals with zoo happy thoughts 😌
The entire worlds population is not going to star bucks. I will guarantee you this future.
Not informative enough.
If we’re not careful, SKYNET will become a reality...

You forgot World War 3 in 2019
If this guy happens to predict all wrong of those, then :L
I wish the world could just stay the way it is
*2036, Androids will take over our jobs.*  *Yes I have been brainwashed by Detroit become human.*
Bionic eye I'm so looking forward  to that
2:46 was I the only one who thought the plane was gonna hit the tower
You can’t tell me what’s going to happen >:T
10:16
You need to go more in depth about every prediction. You treat is as it is a fact this is going to happen and you do not go in depth about the discoveries. No sources on why you think it'll occur. I appreciate your optimism but this is not a good video.
Who else thought that plane at 2:44 was gonna do 9/11
I missed the part where global civilization generally collapses and slides into a dystopian dark age ruled by “strong men” from places like Russia and China. Where there is no more democracy and facts don’t matter. Oh wait... my bad... the beginning of that is rooted in 2016, so before this video was produced.
Please tell me the 2029 one is fake it has to be fake theres no way its real theres no way!!! Please someone tell me its fake! Please reply and tell me
When will people be able  to fly?

Dang,I’ll be seventeen when robots first become a thing.At least I’ll have some time to sit back and watch the world go against a rebellion with the robots xd
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah the population of people stooooooooooppppppp!!!!!!
Scientists are amazing, but their bumming me out with the earth
How will that happen when we are looking at a contentinal drift , below ground subsurface movements and sink holes opening up ? I'm sure you've seen those holes.
2020 is already wrong. Trump has basic killed the solar program so it will not expand at the rate in which they were thinking and will be far from inexpensive due to this administration.
I just wish we could stay in this kind of world that it is today cause technology if you look at it for a long time non stop your eyeballs can fall out and a chance of more people dying
Most depressing news ever xD
I am looking forward to the mini ice age.

I'm a little scared about some of these, those are within my potential lifetime, if it's true that they will cure deafness then I guess there is no point to learn sign language, though it's still nice when I'm sick and can't talk
Can't wait to charge my phone with wifi...if I will still be there...
I think a lot of this will come faster than this video says but maybe that's just me wanting to be able to see every thing happen before I get old but hey in 40 years we can all be immortal of its not illegal

Whatever happens, will happen   We can change   but progress must go on ward   .  Rather  is sooner or later than predicted . We already have substitute  replacement for Nuclear bombs  Hypersonic  weapons that can go 20  times faster then speed of sound. Can you imagine  the commercial practicalities this help transportation  especially in Aerospace industry  and eventually in changes in  rail industry .   we already know there magnetize forces below the earth that be used to transport   large  rail lines  No weather forces interrupt only the operator  and engineer  can stop the train .
The world will be getting worse as time goes on.
1000 times faster OMG I will finally get 1 mbps
I'll be 55 by 2050. If I live that long
By the year 2050         Chocolate will disappear  R.i.p chocolate

A human zoo
I love this channel
erm how do we still be alive after 2029??
“Ohhhh that’s next year”
I can't wait for the ice age :D
I have a really bad feeling it isn't going to go well for the human race by 2050.
Currently, we’re in a global warming, but I do believe when the sun burns out more before the red giant stage it will start a mini ice age, then humans can just start dumping garbage again because they won’t need to worry, jk don’t litter👌
BRIGHT SIDE will cross 100 million subscribers oh yeah
he didn't mention ww3 so will it happen or no????some one please tell me
HE SAID NORWAY WRONG!!!! ITS NORWAY NOT NARWAY!   Edit:nvm he said norway

Non of them, sorry
In the year 2030 Europe will be part of the middle east, become a caliphate & turned back to stone age.
Feel bad for kidss born 2005 and after no type of childhood :(
How did you know?!??? 😊😏😏😶

The 2030s sound awesome!
This is sad

MARS!!!!
Umm u guys aren't gunna question the meteor I'm scared
These vids are all long winded and spoken with a curious exaggerated tone, as if we listeners are all imbeciles.
Everyone will be brain stimulated 😟
Eh
A lot of this stuff is crazy and POSSIBLE but is honestly not going to be serious when they first come out, mainstreaming will take ages... don’t worry
No wrinkles? Robot boyfriends? Cool. Now I just have to make sure I’m rich enough to enjoy the future.
I'm scared
Did anyone hear 👂 that he said WW3.

there will be more robots then people by 2050
Year 2068 Half-life 3 will get an official trailer
Detroit become human in real life ??!?
Climate change will happen... Asteroids are still a constant threat... We will all end up torched by the sun and swallowed by a blackhole dead or alive.
Oh no we are gonna get a mini ice age aww man😣
Good I will be dead! Like culture shock to me in 2050!

All i hear from the future is more electricity and everything is electricity.
When I’m 35 years old????
What about 🇮🇶 Iraq?
Hmmm I hope that one day the human race can colonize a planet so that when they detect something bad is gonna  happen to earth we will have a back up and just switch planets, but we need a ship that travel as fast as light in order to find other exoplanets that are good homes for us :3
2019 YAAAAAA DENMARK FTW!!!!!!

We won’t last that long
Robotic immortality.
I am looking forward to noise canceling windows in the future
Man some really cool space things are happening exactly when I will start my life of trying to become an astronaut, but unfortunately I may not be one of the first people on Mars because I will just be 22 and still in college studying for the job.
The narrator sounds like the Illusive Man from Mass Effect 2 and 3
If u look in the future and you change a decision that ur destined to make u will rupture the time line.
In the 60's they said we would be living on the moon by the year 2000.

Hamdulla Allah uakbeer, Jesus and shiva, I will start to save now for my SEXBOT youyyoo supa supar
What about the three years after 2020
What? Most of this is completely uncertain. It's mostly made up!
im from denmark :D
By 2030 bitcoin will be the worlds currency.
2020 the year i go to highschool and the year we can celebrate Donald Trump not being pres anymore
and again. Another lie! The real truth is the sun will be so big in the next billion year that it will explode and our planet will go boom boom/
Lets just hope WW3 doesn't happen
This makes me happy that we’ll use electric cars and solar power
2050 Žalgiris vis dar LKL čempionai.
Idk why I watch this when I’m scared that this will happen so STOP PLSSS!
so you are god? that u know everything? even the future?
When he said ‘2019’ I was just thinking “oh, I got this one MCR is getting back together” then I starting crying
I have been to barcelona
Sitting here doing math to figure out how old I’ll be.
Not every thing is true
I see Philippines!
Is this is a mirage or what? You can't live in space. You need oxygen.. And Nobody even cares about the Environment anymore. My prediction  is that people are just gonna get more selfish and selfish and be more materialistic per normal.  First of all we humans created by God are made to live in Earth. Our Earth is big compared to other planets. You cannot survive anywhere else unless you're  on a spaceship. And relying on technology would be a risky move. Let's just be humans for once and breathe the air wr have right now
All of them I'm only 13 I'm not that old
I feel like some people are living in a  fantasy. Everything is genetic and We cannot beat the system,  especially God who rules the world. God is our future and let's just hope ww3 doesn't start somewhere. Let's leave  the future to God
I'll be 97 years old in 2050 . Actually, I'll be dead.
Oh I notice whenever I dream it's the next day
In 2026 I will get my drivers license in august
I will be 47 in 2050. I will be so old
Ayy nuxshhh advace mag isipp😂
Also in 2025 th u.s. army will stop using lodestars a.k.a black bombers
I hope none of this happens. This just terrifies me. I want to learn how to drive a gas car. I want to meet real people as I get older not robotic people. I don’t want a more modified world than we already have. I want to graduate high school and not have a completely different world two years later. I don’t know if we really be getting a longer life I think it would be more of a shorter life. Because there would me more electronics that people would get attached to and they might be still alive but they won’t really be there. I feel like humans biggest predators are ourselves. I wish people would just leave things alone we don’t need to know everything. I’m going to pray are world doesn’t turn out like that.
How does he know all this stuff 🧐 I’m confused lol 😂
TELEPORTATION AND MARS!!!!!!!!!SPACE!!!!!!!
2020
AND WE STILL HAVEN'T FIND A CURE FOR CANCER.

2021 : Time travel will be open to the public
We will all become soulless robots,
RealLifeLore made this video first you copied him...
7:11 Anyone catch that? is he said "The probability of the astronaut"
Watch from 7 10
UAE is makng a bigger one than saudi
So, humanity will finally colonise a planet other than Earth in just over 30 years huh?
Can't we just stay on Earth.... I'll be alive for all these years, humanity sounds scary now...thx bright side I'm not so bright now..😞
Global warming is still a thing. Electric cars Will not ride for long because to create electricity you need factorys and factorys are bad for the global warming. Sorry for bad english I’m dutch
Heh, I might not live to 2050 now on purpose...
Hey
just asking, how to you know!!!!!
I'm looking forward for the zombie apocalypse.
Going to mars😁😁
The jedda tower will be destroyed
Tharse a flood in my city in 7:00 summer 2018
Charging my phone over WiFi.
7:11 ... The probability of the *ASTRONAUT* colliding with earth. That's one huge astronaut.
Jesus is coming sooner than you think.
The astroid
Didn't mention about the Amazon foreat that will be wiped out
7:12 You said astronaut instead of asteroid
The future is pretty bleak for me. I hope I will be dead way before that. I still do not understand how technology improving ours lives?
Ha ima love WiFi that charged my phone
_What will happen before 2050_  It's already before 2050.
I’m kinda scared about the ice age thing
2050, lightsabers and blaster.  Or maybe phasers and photon torpedos.  It's something to look foward
The Yankees will win their 40th title and Tom Brady will still be playing.
To much internet for today...
Æ skal faen ikke ha el bil
Detroit Become Human
See ya in 22 years
This seems spoopy
I can't wait to go to mars
Only god knows what’ll happen
WOW YOUR ALSOME
OMGGGG AURORA, Does that means that the space ship will crash in another planet and he will need to survive hunting alien fish and creating a freaking submarine with just metal and glass....
3:30  The space hotel will turn into the space titanic
I will be 43 when it’s 2050!
I will be 45 in 2050
Hh, have you ever learn?! Remember 1900s, they said the 21st century has flying stuff, but instead they get memes instead? Yeah, it's not really happen.
Earths population will reach 8 billion  me: * dies of anger *
Lol my kids will be laughing of how untrue of this in some more years
I think he meant asteroid not astronaut
The colonists to Mars. Heck I'll be 51 in 2050
You had only 6 million short ago??
I'm looking forward to the Mars expedition, who else are?
Non, it's scary
Hoping no formal education( school college) Will be needed all knowledge will be on Internet by2050
Astronaut
46 when we start colonizing mars I think I could make it
Why did I have to be born in 2000? I'm gonna be living with 9 billion people when I'm 38 years old.
And Kurdistan too will be independent
😥
Just stop growing with the population, because we get 9 Billion people before 2050...
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Vid : what will happen in the future?  Me: *stops vid*   Me: well....u no  Me : u will be older...  Me : and ppl will be more lazy ppl will always use there phones....and technology😑😒  Edit : omg 3 LIKES THATS TOO MUCH....
Any subnautica fan knows that sending a mission to Mars named Aurora won't end well
In the year 2038, we will get personal android. Who gets the reference?
you mist somthing becose war is going to happend with all this
With trump in office, we won’t have much of a future. Trump is killing the world with his deregulating everything that protects us, air, water and our health.
I look forward to augmentation since im goin blind in my right eye.
The teleportation thingy
Why did they have to have that airplane flying past that building at 2:46???
**GETS NUKED**
2028 was my favourite
brain implants, so now instead of wasting tome trying to trick you into changing they just need to flip a switch (so to speak)
None
well trump is now president of the united states so i guess anything that happens in the next thirty years really wont surprise me.
Jesus  will be coming before this happen
Just hopping none of this will ever happen
Philipin me
im going to be 46 years old in 2050 XD
7:08 astronaut but it says asteroid
All
Technologies is very slow. Is not acceptable from outer space.
Year 2050 and the US will haven´t  yet change to metric system -_-
increasing reaction time? shouldn't it be decreasing?
*sigh*... I Was hoping that in the future..     SCHOOLS WILL END QUICKER...  ;~;
I thought that the world would be over in 2025
Why is no one talking about the melting of the arctic ocean? You see how serious it is right?
When do you think a tribulation will occur?
the fututre sometimes scares me
I'm scared now
2029 The Apophis 😱
Ill be 47 in 2050!
*I feel like our population will drop.* We’re not having as many kids like we did in the past. Families back then would have like 6 kids. They all helped out at the farm n stuff. Nowadays, we have machines helping us, and children are so gosh darn expensive. I even heard a ‘theory’ at school that there will be more old people than young people in the future. Older people are living longer lives because of the medication we have. You’d think it would play the same role on younger people, but in the first time in forever the life expectancy dropped some.
1st question.. I see the future mostly in dreams but the farthest its gone is a year tops
You didn't say all of the years before 2050
Are we gonna see a get ready with me from from jefree star on space hotel !!!!
I hope 🤞 the North Pole doesn’t melt 😢
7:12 mastake or it is just me i heard you say astronaut it need to be asteroid
Wow  This video changed my friends and myself    Now we are thinking   What shoud we do now....
i'd rather go to the past. =I
What 6:37
In 2019 there's going to be a flying car
im from denmark😂
all of this is going to be terrible
2019 apple will make the iPhone 20
2:45 💥BOOM💥
year  2061, there is going to be a single universal gender....*SJW triggers*
A zoo without cages... Isn't that just the wild
5:00 hmm sound familiar. Nano-machines son
Looking forward to the ice age
Am scared of the meteor 😬😰
one piece might be done by 2050!! lol
Maybe in the future we can have competitions to see who has the best mini Lego Star destroyers
I have been to the Cathedral in Barcelona
I know where I want to go next !!! VENICE !
I f we use electric cars and solar panels and all why wont the climate go back to normal? Cant it get better?
This is so scary.
I cant wait for 2035 and 2038
If animals are free to roam... IT'LL BE MY DREAM!! <33 NO. MORE. CAGES. ANIMALS. ARE. FREE. LIKE. US!! <33333
What if we are in a simulation and Everytime it finishes it restartes and slowly things change thats why we get memories we think happened or if you been there.        JK 😂🤣
Well I’ll be 49
in 2050 everyone wouldve wish they listen to all the warnings i feel like they will also be a new type of gender since we already have trans people i guess its like what he said a new species
It’s looking scary for me up to my 49 years of life
Hello myself. When you see this you're like 50 years old. This is only 2018, I really hope our goals and dreams were achieved now in 2050.
My prediction  It will be like Wall-e but people are idiots. Watch the movie idiocrocy (srry if I spelled it wrong) it could be real
I'll be 56 in 2050. Eww lol old
Here's my take on this future predicted event before the year 2050 let's provide food and water for all human being around the world.
There is an Italian channel that copy you! It’s called “il lato positivo”
Being a person in a wheelchair,  I look forward to 2030... :)
Which is different  ;:only legends can                                         💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿📀💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿
How do you know what’s going to happen in the future?
Global currency? Possibility of ww3? Noetic science? Smart cities? Global warming? Evolution of 3D printers? The refugee problem? Gooood there are so many questions I want to ask.
At least this future prediction didn't have anything to do with the earth being Murdered...
If there going to invent bionic eyes, why would 50% of the population sufer from short sidedness? .. and fyi, camera contants were invented in the 90s just haven't been released to the public like 90% of the things mentioned here
Anyone else notice when he says he'd just, "Like to know what stocks to pick" the reflection in his glasses is swiping through girl's dating profiles?
What if u dont have wifi
1000 time faster internet connection ahm ahm
We get destroyed by asteroid or global warming and nuclear/garbage wastes
IF YOU ARE READING THIS IN 2050, MESSAGE ME SOMEHOW.
who is here before 2050?
Why you should use robots??? The only good things I see in this video are the Sagrada Familia and the posibblity to go to Mars. Sorry, but it is my opinion
What im exicted about is electric cars
Omg i will be waiting for 2025 when you can charge with wifi :D
Why you should use a sexrobot instead of a hot girl??????????!!!
Why you should make a gene modification baby??.?.????????????.
Everyone We HAVE to do everything we can to save our enviorment!
I'm happy these events will be in my lifetime
You can charge ur phone using wifi heck yeah
How does he know about the future
This is what will happen  OMG
Your videos are great but a little long winded, especially with ‘jokes’ at the beginning. I think what you say in 12 mins you could complete in 8 mins. Thanks
We cannot predict. In 1918, who could predict what would happen by 1950! By 1918, Titanic disaster, Great War, electricity, phones, tanks, guns. By 1950, Hindenburg disaster, jets,  TV, films/celebrities, carriers, computers, nukes, space travel, WW2, Depression.
No information about cancer treatment ;(
Ali-A in 2050: WHAT’S GOING ON GUYS TODAY IMMA SHOW YOU GUYS WHERE TO FIND AN ROBO T-REX IN FORTNITE BATTLE ROYALE     *Ali-A intro begins*
Aurora? Well hopefully it doesn’t get shot down by an alien gun onto a planet made of water
Ooo I know what will happen to humans before 2050! There all extinct :( that’s what I think XD
How do you know all of this
Can’t wait for the Lakers to win the championship in 2019!!!
All of them becuase I should still be alive!!!😄
Nobody knows how the future will be like only god knows 🌏but all we need is prashants and pray every day and night for a new day we just stick with the present not future 🙏🙏
I'm 13 now so at 2050 I would be 45 so can I go to mars
year 2024
No anti-aging stuff. I will be 57 in 2050 .. I already feel old
I will be 77 and will not recognize this country anymore if these Young socialist Berniemaniacs take over........
But spaceX is planning their first manned mission to mars for 2024 and first colonisation of mars in 2026 he missed that out :(
Okay so i know that some of this would be a lie or even all of it because  i would be alive threw all of it
4:57 , increasing reaction times? isn't that like..a bad thing?
but how he know all about this?ofc he's not god ...also if he searched up on the internet how the internet knows? lol...I'm pretty confused about that
Who else is freaking out about the asteroid one???
Ill be 47, thats crazy.
3:06 HEY what about computers?
2020: space hotel crashes 2055: space hotel the space tanic
When I get to see the iPhone 1000000
Wth did i just watch?
Oh!I know what will happen before 2050.Their will be a war between uncontrolled ,self-replicating robots and humanity.And eventually by 2100 all of humanity will be extinct.Come on read the story of horizion game.Just kidding it's just a PS4 game.U never now,robots can malfunction.
The probability of the astronaut...?
Sounds awful, it already started
1990 to 1999 was the best time.
I don't think this is going to happen we are going to destroy the earth before 2050 and I hope I won't we living until then follow me on insta for more @save_our_w0rld
Was hoping for a cure for cancer at some point in this
7:11 no not the astronaut!
I'm looking forward to the giant volcano eruption that will asphyxiate us all xD
May 24th 2022 Yellowstone volcano will erupt and America will end
We already have a cage free zoo in Texas, so they can't be FIRST. In New Braunfels. It's been there for over 20 years.
man no flying cars?? lol

I'm,from papua New guinea

Don’t be like Jehovah’s Witnesses by making this video.. Earth will remain here forever and it will be better than what it is today.. it’s God’s time to choose when he will fix it. It is not meant for us to live in space. Unless he choose it to be otherwise this will not happen.
*faints of screaming*
I like the world as it is
gender will no longer exist and breathing will become offensive. also babies will the the right to decide weather they want to be born or not.  Quote me.

well years ago they thought 2020 is terrifying now what they were afraid of.. did happen but it's nothing for us.. like if we say years ago white people were afraid that the black people will have rights.. and that happened but it's a good thing for us while no one of them is still alive to live this fear.. if we take that example and we put it on our future.. well it's terrifying future that we are waiting for.. and due to the fast increasing technology and socialism .. it seems that we unlike the white old people will live our fears.. and we will watch some strange generations and ideas and stuff will make us don't wanna live in this world..but no one cares.. that hurts.. but truth.. we'll find out some way to live and let live
humans are going down i think the future is terrifying
I wonder what Starbucks would be like in the future!!
Why is there no fortnite updates here
The CIA are who killed JFKennedy. Because the illuminati told. He wanted to end the war in Vietnam, what the CIA didnt wanted. So they simply send a man who assacionated him just because he was right and peace but the illuminati wanted this.

Wait, "increasing reaction time"? You sure about that?
Probability of the astronaught colliding with earth?? 7:12, thought it was the astroid Apophis 🤔🤔

4:16 BO2
I would really love to see this all happen with my parents on my side but I think age should be left alone. Death is a natural cause that I think we should all accept as our non escapable fate. Believe it or not, we are in this world to suffer. This applies as the meaning of life to both religious and athiest people.
This is all true.
Yes to the internet being 1000 times faster and bionic eyeballs.
Why shortsighted
That asteroid scared me😞

He said twenty one hundred (20100) and it's twenty one hundred (2100)
2036 It is like lost in space
Wonder how much of this will be true
2020 will make Star Wars great Jedi Tower
Y’all forgot fortnite will become a trend
How can you tell there was a huge World War II battle
The Asteroid thing scared me..
If Subnautica has taught me anything, it's that NEVER UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES do you name your spaceship "Aurora."
Read agenda 21 if you really want to know your future, oh yeah new world order coming soon!!!!

I Will look forward TO THE FREAKING WORLD!! AND THE ANIMALS AND NATURE!! I DONT LIKE THESE ‘NEW’ THINGS ITS HORRIBLE WE HAVE TO FIX THE PLANET TOGETHER SO THAT WE CAN HAVE BETTER WIFI N STUFF. ANIMALS ARE ALREADY DIEING AND DO NOT EVEN EXIST ANYMORE. IF WE KEEP DOING LIKE THIS WE HAVE TO GO TO OTHERPLANETS AND STAY THERE. LIKE THE SERIES THE 100
The ROBLOX Movie.
When I think of future, I remember that XVI century painting, "Melancholy" by German artist Albrecht Duerer. An angel staring at technologial progress with mixed feelings... grieve? Sorrow? Fear?

Jeddah 3.303 somethings 4or 4anatics illuminati :D
I don't mean to be a downer, but I seriously doubt a lot of this is going to be anywhere near accurate. Brain implants for entertainment purposes? I wouldn't look for that for at least another couple hundred years and that's if we work really hard at developing that specific technology.
whats the title of the instrument thats playing
In 2:10 to 2:13, the elephant was peeing.

I don’t like where things are going too many people like maybe instead of focusing so much on technical things we should make sure the earth is still habitable
I hope that solar panels will be more common and that electric only cars will be used a heck of a lot more.
What if this is all fake how do they see the future, One answer THEY CAN'T .__.
Oooo im gonna be O-OO-OOOLD im gonna be like 55 years old if 2050
the internet being 1000 times faster

7:11 the possibility of the astronaut hitting earth. Lol mistakes are what make us human.
i was looking for when google reaches enough money to make the internet 1000x faster *FORTNITE IS DA BAST*
this is kinda scary...….
But no mention of how morality and values will further deteriorate. Yeah, technology will advance, but we will lose our humanity. We're long due for another mass extinction.
Hey I dont believe it until I get my researches from Quran or hadith or I see it
..I'll be alive for all of these... I wish I was 50 so I won't experience everything in here, somethings on here (for me) aren't that good for me (my opinion)...
I hope Yah is back by then.
where you guys trying to reference 9/11 when that airplane flew threw that one tower!!?!?!?!?
*_year 2050: fortnite will hit season 100_*

How do you know everything in this video is all true. Are you from the future
you forgot about how there's gonna be more plastic in the ocean than fish in 2050.
Omg Aurora its the same planet name in the movie in Netflix "Singularity"
You missed out 2027 its alright anyways.
Islam is what will happen. Half the world is thrown back into Stone Age. (and that is the good ending) The End.
I wonder how much of these are true . I guess we will just have to find out
I dont think that the future will be good or peaceful, thee will be no humanity people will go to mars there will be a lot more consumption of electricity, water, oil and other resources and it is to be claim that till 2024 water will end in many countries such as Pakistan etc and an asteroid will be much closer to earth here will be robots bionic eyes. Humanity will end!! THese are the last stages of Humanity :(
How do you know it
if there will even be a 2050 no one seems to care about global warming
2019: everyone is suffering from ligma and sugma
So depressing
:)
okay first few things you say doesn't effect humans
You bozos, the population is already too high to actually decrease more than a billion people between now and then
*DESPACITO 69 WILL BE RELEASED IN 2050*
This freaked me out more than it made me excited for the future..
So basically people will become even more dependent on technology.
The brain implants the new prosthesis and Anon wrinkling of the skin
Well at least I learned something about myself from the internet; I have chronophobia.
I don’t want to dive an electric car. I wanted a big air polluting truck.
Usa should not allow self driving cars no one wants to sit in a car that you can't control at least it's what teens and young adults would say
wow do you have obsession with starbucks????
In 2033: spacex : lets name this mission Aurora sees brightspace spacex: let's not.

I’m sure by 2029 people will invent some powerful weapon to destroy asteroids
I hope for the Armageddon. >:D
I definitely am looking forward to better health stuff
I bet these ain't real
we will still have road construction and those orange cones for miles and miles
I’m so excited
The future seems so cool and beneficial. I’m glad I’m pretty young right now
In 2050 people would be arresting the people who still like Justin Beiber who is  an old man
Also when there's 8 billion people 99 percent of the world's population will be police
I was actually expecting an Alien invasion 😭😢
Oof whos watching 2020

Lieing I mean
How do you even know this you must be lieung
Colonization of mars
I’m scared about the Earth getting hit!! Cause I’m young!
Human integration with technology is inevitable. All humans will be opted to receive cybernetic implants and modifications. Connecting all humans to each other in many communicable ways. Government control over people and humanity will challenge human rights. All humans with such implants will have unnatrual long life, able to preform insane mental and physical feats, and have more complex lifestyles. Possibly teachers teaching through the implant tech and peoples whole life memories, experiences, and events recorded on said implants.  Maybe even a company called: Mark with a model of implant called Beast....lol
#feralessnepal
I’m shaking cause I don’t like what will happen in the future.
I like Earth. I don’t want it to change into a machine like planet. I’m good with the technology now.

The robot thing
Im going to be 47 at mars
Jokes on you I never go to starbucks

The disabled part and the physical body part were people in wheel chairs can walk
I am not looking forward to any of this

Lowkey worried about some of this
i hope none of this actually happens
We're all gonna be mulato's with muslim beliefs shouting alla akbar !
Wow! Starbucks will be rich!
That really sucks Soo bad!!!! Be careful of what you produce.
why do we have to make more and more new things??
BUT WILL THE NET BE QUICK ENOUGH FOR ME TO PLAY A DECENT ONLINE STREET FIGHTER MATCH ON EARTH AGAINST SOMEONE ON THE MOON? =)
You missed out in 2020 when Trump starts WW3 😂
This scares me. The future scares me
I will be 61 at the year 2050
in 2025 the beta spartans will appear xD
Anything to permanently cure vision and hearing problems would be very welcome.  In addition,  any use of implants to accelerate learning.
You got China ban gas cars  2020
you copied real life lore
I would be ded becuz in 2050 💜 island
deageing ? please )
In summary humans will depend on technology for a living
1:50 i saw philippines i was like "im there!!!!! Inside it!!!!"
What im extited about is the faster wifi
i dont want to have kids because of all of these possibilities.
Looking forward for immortality
That means we can get 10 gbps in 30 to 50 dollars
Internet will becomes 1000 times faster
Too many people getting laid.
Dude, our planet is a cageless zoo.
Will Kashmir be independent as both India and Pakistan currently occupy it???
Anyone else watching this in 2026 :P
nothing in austraila show beyond 2000 happened, so why will any these things happened, and who say will be still be here , these are just theories on what could happen
im looking forward to seeing when they put people on mars, i dont think thats going to happen though. so im looking forward to seeing how that works out
7:11 *asteroid
There will be a curre for cancer
I was amaze at The zoo without cages and the dubailand
What a life I have ahead......

First of all I live in the year 4076, two, WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO DORITOS!!! Xd
burg mia khalifa
WIFI CHARGING
I look forward to them discovering how to warp space so they can travel to other stars at faster than light speeds. I definitely expect that by 2035. They have the math worked out. They pretty well know how to do it, just not how to produce the necessary power. The power requirements, while lower than Miguel Alcubierre's original model, are still huge. The power generation systems we have at present are just not capable of producing the required current and voltage.
jesus now im more scared about the astroid
None
Boy, when that astronaut collides w Earth in 2029.. wait “astronaut?”
Realistic Yu Gi Oh duels like in the anime is what I'm waiting for.
The worst part is that most of our relatives will be dead, or even us.
I think you mean "decreasing" a soldier's reaction time.
In 2050 I'll be 47 years old.
OMG im gonna be 45 in 2050 uh life sucks
What was that about a mini ice age?!?
Alpha Centauri?  I'll look out for that.

I’d look forward to hotels in space
I WILL GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL IN 2025 OH BOI THERE WILL BE A BIG SURPRISE FOR ME AND THE PEOPLE THE SAME AGE.
I mean this seems kinda true I mean 15 years ago no one ever thought that mostly everyone would have high tech smartphones now image in another 30 years chips implanted in your brain might be the norm
Aw man no flying cars and futuristic buildings?
I'm just waiting for a new Call of Duty 😑
Mars
Bionic eyes for sure... imagine the possibilities!
The colonization of Mars here I come
7:11 What Astronaut is that?     Yo Mama?
I'm going to graduate in 2020 after that then going to sixth grade
I’m looking forward to nothing😜   I’m kidding I’m glad we’re getting rid of gas more solar panels and a better nuclear plant
And music gets shittier.
If birth rate increases and death rate decreases won’t overpopulation become a problem   If it’s not balanced as it is now it would become a problem
Futurama already did this, but they went way farther!
How cold will the „Mini ice age“ get?
I'm sorry but there's quite a few things in the system probably not going to happen including the idea of implanting stimuli ships into actual US soldiers as this is an unconstitutional act, and would fall to a federal lawsuit that will not fare well for the US government.
The astroid freaked me out.
My dad said to me in a dream that roads will become slick with oil by 2070.
I would be about a 40 year old :/
Deafness doesn’t need fixing
SPACE TRAVEL!!!!
Ice age I'm looking forward to it
And there will still be no cure for cancer!
When U realise that U would be like 40 years old when all the cool stuff happens :c
meh
I hope that the commentator learns decent jokes he is really bad
A cure for cancer
11:31
I don't want people to suffer from anything
Real life lore did this already but urs is better
8:22 Lego mindstorms ev3?

No nuke town 2025 :c

Im still only a kid and know I don't know how long I will realty live.
the scary thing is, im going to be alive during all this. I hope that miny ice age kills a few people off tho. 7 billion people is a lot. 9 billion will be even worse.
My mom will be 80 years old
Now I'm scared
7:11 astronaut lol
3 ( ||| ) rd world-war - REDUCE HUMAN POPULATION .Stephen Hawking Says "We only got  this Century to Get Out this Rotting - Overpopulated Dump Called Earth .Not enough Resources Too Many Humans.

The internet will be 1,000x faster ? (Ali-a intro rolls)
Fear or questions will happen to alone you

Do you want fear or think about it if now
BRIGHT SIDE how old are you?
I would love Wi-Fi charging I know we all get frustrated when we can't find your phone and it died but if Wi-Fi charging took place and we'd find it and it wouldn't be that bad how cool would that be
I REALLY WANT THAT 1000x FASTER INTERNET NOW SO I CAN UPDATE FORTNITE IN JUST 1 SEC!! LIKE IF U AGREE :D

7:11 *asteroid
Donald Trump 😂😂
Awesome
What would a “Mini-Ice Age” be like??? Because I’ll still be alive in 2035.....I’m kinda scared
I look forward to pretty much all of these, although some might not be true
I would be about 32 when the bionic eye would be commercially available and I would finally be able to see out of both eyes
Yeah all this will happen these years as long as there’s no WW3 but if WW3 happens none of this will be true
if these Predictions scare you well there just Predictions there not gonna happen or they will who knows anyways i just wanted to say that there just Predictions and may or may not come true if your scared of them there simply just a Prediction
Anyone notice that he said astronaut instead of asteroid
2099 end
Everybody will be living at Starbucks to brush teeth, shower, wifi, sleep...... 11:26
one thing missing in this video about 2050 is that machine will take over and will be working for them.
Why can’t cars have wifi in the car
I dislike most of them except the colonization of mars get rid of some of those 9 billion people
I've predicted my future while I was awake by having visons and they've happened ALWAYS
whats gonna happen to mount everest
is this totally accurate? Obviously not to a "t" but, is it close?
I can tell you what happens before then
So there's nothing about the flat earth age of enlightenment ?
Detroit BH anyone??
Aahaahhah who do you think who you are?
i hope space hotel has air
Take the rising water from oceans and desalinate that water and use it to make more forests
My prediction in 2060 that there will be a apocalypse oh and you forgot that in July 27th there will be a blood moon eclipse
There will be a disease much worse than AIDS Hey it's just nature we cure one nature fights back
ITS SO COOL! MARS? SERIOUSLY? IM LOOKING FORWARD TO LIVING ON A NEW PLANET!
Disney will rule the world is my 2nd theory
The iPhone XXXXI will be released alongside the iMac quantum laptop pro

You can't predict the future ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
QUANTUM TELEPORTATION!!!!!? OMGGGGGG!!!!!!!!!! THATS INSANE!!!! Lol
I heard there’s a rumor that a super highway might be built from London to New York...
I sat down I think "what is life?
We need to stop having kids seriously world hunger is only gonna get worse
what about the consequences
r u god
I'll be 45 in 2050😱
just like call of duty infinite warfare
When is World War 3? And when is faster-than-light space travel?
Still no cure for cancer ;(
Dying
No way that those space probes will hit a quarter the speed of light
First people Meow meow
I'm very very scared to this kind of world😨
In 2028, "Asia will become the center of all air travel." Can you be a bit more specific? It's not as if Asia is one country.
Jesus Coming is what I’ll look forward too :/
People born today won't be able to understand teens in the year 2050. The language will change so much.
mini ice age
:/ to bad I’m ganna miss lots of things

Wut well hapon by 10000000000000000000000000000000000099999999999
There would be less white people.
Hopefully, BRIGHT SIDE would stop existing.
that thumbnail tho
which year will the school end
This is honestly too scary
Just seen this. A couple of things. Why would the military want to increase the reaction time of a soldier? Also, the Sagrada Familia in Barcelona is not a cathedral, it's a basilica.
I’m getting sad because I don’t want the world to be so futuristic
In the year 2020.....               Kanye West will be president!!!!!
2:43 Am I the only one who tought the plane would crash into the building
How about every one finally learns to get along and war will be a thing of the past.
Oh boy so many things are so far-fetched in this video, but well you can keep dreaming.

Teleportation
Bionic eyes, no wrinkles, repairable sensation omg...a hope for dementia maybe ?brain transplant..
The thumbnail is kinda creepy. Just don’t wanna think about it
Aurora? FROM SUBNAUTICA, we all know how that ended
I look forward to apophis so i dont need to worry about energy bills when im older
before 2050 God will be shocked  to know all this has happened  on earth.

2025 I’m going to graduate😊😊👨🏽‍🎓👨🏽‍🎓

9 billion people?                                                                        *OHWVHRRPOPULASHYUN!!!!!!*
Almost failed at 1:03😂
Kinda a lot some times in my dreams
By 2050 I will be 45 I will most likely see all of this THIS IS INSANE
When I grow up I’m probably going to be saying ‘back in the day when I was a small child, England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 was not filled with electricity and was calmer not calm but clamER.😂😂😂😂
I see a bad bad bad bad bad bad bad future that i don't wana live
I don't like either of them
Colonisation of mars
HAY YAH. I WILL BE ALIVE IN 2050
Spoilers
What does a mini ice age mean?

How would you know?
I’m most concerned about how music will be like in 10 years😬
I live in Dubai
Damnet I like living as a country boy fooking internet
I was expecting this video to be a lot more depressing. I am looking forward to many of the predictions! :)
I feel weird thinking that I’ll be like 40 or so then
Buy stocks from: NTDOY (Nintendo Co. Ltd. )
It scares me
what if people quit having children, they actually may which could decrease the population and change the world for many years,  start a new baby boomer generation in 75 years lol.
Tbh this thing was like "in the year 2037 in June 3 at 3:57 PM, you will open the front door of your house after a long day of work" legit way too specific
And my mortgage will pay off On 2028
You said Astronaut when talking about the asteroid in 2029.
Mini ice age sounds interesting
Will Fortnite still be a thing?
In 2040 there will be tooth camera
Now I realize I cant have the life I want it is all changing and this video is sad but true.
...And in 2077 they voted my city the worst place to live in America.
2025
3:07 R.I.P NOKIA

i still get 5mbps internet half mile from a neighborhood
I wish that the medical system should start fixing more diseases instead of cancer. Take Migraines for one. Many people suffer those and doctors have no idea how to fix them. Im not saying that we shouldn't fix cancer, but try to also find cures for other diseases.
7:12 "the probability og the *astronaut* colliding with earth"
Ok that's all good but when will TES6 get released??
I'm just hoping by 2050 we dont have feminist in mars
NWO 🗣
2040 - Valve releases half life 3
Years later bright side will be known as the one who predicted future. Just think someone making "Did you know that A Channel named Bright Side was able to predict the future"
We don't need robots
I’d hope earths population would go down from living on different planets
No!!!!!
Cool. Hopefully I'll live for all of this. If anything this is what dissuades me from suicide.
charging your phone with wifi sounds cool
The NEW WORLD SYSTEM for Humans.
4:12 any comparison?
I miss the venus project in this story :)
If I live to be 100 I've lived from the 20th century to the 22nd
2051: Facebook will now have a battle royale mode
8:19 bruh dat rover made outta legos
The real future of human on earth, all depends on what this spoiled orange top narcissistic kid will do in next few year that are remaining! Sad and Bigly!!!
I know what im NOT looking forward to.. That astroid .
9:45 2036: Super HD Rez Eyes Invented 11:28 2050: 50% Will Suffer From Short Sighterniss?????????????????????????????????????????????????
What the fu k! nobody is trippin about a mini ice age??
Will the big rock will hit earth hope not ..
If I’m 14 now, than in 2050 I would be 47 years old hmmm
And biological immortality? You forgot to mention it!
So Rockstar Games is not making a Bully 2?
How will people get to and from the space hotel.        But still sounds dope
This won't include anyone who is poor, they'll be eliminated in the future.
I'm not gonna use Grab or uber in 2025! I'll own my own Toyota Corolla Hatchback!
When i press read more then i see a comment about gatis
omg i will be a woman before 2050!!!
all of them lol
4:50 thats not how electricity works
a spacehotel definetly wont happen in 2 years
"Time only depends on us"    By me"
5:56
I will only be 45 years old by 2050 and i think i will live until the year 2080
After seeing this i felt like an old man smh
You forgot something , 2019 fortnite dies out
...andjust where  are you  getting  all this information
There has to be other forms of life outside earth though. Like other beings that are also trying to find ways to get to us. Living long enough to see that happen would be the greatest gift ever
I will be still alive till 2060   Cuz im 13
i am looking forward to see the free zoo <3
Kind of sucks that most of us probably won't even be around in 2050. I just want to live long enough to see people colonize another planet
I am looking forward to he bionic eyes because I am only 11 now and after when they are availabe I will be 29 so I will get them
2:45 ALLAH AKBAR
Did I just hear bionic eyes?
Did decpacito 2 come out?
6:53 gene modification? Does that mean we can modify the genes of somebody to make them a cat girl??
How do you know this is all true???
The Mars ... I would like to see that. thanks
7:12 astronaut?
Man we still won’t have genetically modified cat girls
2050
Will Starbucks have the Java chocolate  chip coffee in 2050 ??
7:11 "probability of the 'astronaut' colliding with earth"
Scientist say that dinosaurs will be created soon with their dna from their bones
Soooooo no worries on overpopulation and world hunger or the exhaustion of finite resources?
Human hybrid and Transformers
Back in my day we used to have to put on our VR Headsets
sounds like being rich might be the necessity of having a good life in the future
2019 Crisis ???
I'm in 2050  come from the future to warned you that         You got fool.   I am really not in 2050 trolololo
I'm Scared From this.........        I DONT LIKE IT
An astronaut was scheduled to crash into the Earth.
I am from the future and none of these except the contact lens invented by a tech working for Nikon  bought out by Johnson and Johnson called  Optivid is real.  So obviously time travel exists. but only to go to the past since future has not happened .
Relax  everyone  it's you tube after all.
Everyone was curious about the future and you guys chose YouTube as your first option *face palm* 😂
I love the google it’s making internet faster
Will gameing be more immersive
I’m still pretty much a kid, so I’ll be able to witness this all. I’m also in America. I’m actually really happy to see so man accomplishments so early in my life if they happen :)
I want to get one them brains🧠
No mention of mass migration that will see poverty of biblical scales.  What happens when Africa doubles its population in the next 30 years?  Europe will have no option but to close its borders and let people starve.
7:11 ...”the probably of the astronaut colliding with earth...” is very likely and won’t have to wait for until then.
Don't forget that in 2039 that California will have their High Speed train line complete! What's awesome is that I live there!
I wonder what year it'll finally be when video game companies realize that 30 fps for games is not acceptable
I want to go to one of those space hotels :)
all
The only future event I think of everyday is the Comet and how it would feel if I am dead. And what do you know? I will be alive when these event happen.
Who will win the world cup thats the important question.. USA
One of Trumps bonehead Son will be President
Who wants to bet over half of the things on this list will never happen. Besides I like the way things are now. I don’t want change!
2049 will end
The probability of the astronaut hitting
So is this bad or good?
Time machine
The astroid
The probability of the astronaut colliding with earth is quite minimal due to the atmosphere and all.
ill be 47 by 2050 ... god dam time
these are lies
I will be 43 in 2050 oof
Mcr will come back
Bee movie 2 will be released
Shrek 5 will come out
I hope Life is not hard for me
5:43 Nucular? This is George W. Bush all over again...
Well my son
I graduate in 2024
By 2024, donald trump will have left office. By 2030, disney will own the entirety of the entertainment industry By 2035, the simpsons will stop running By 2040, the leading cause of death in the world will be from heat. By 2045, the icecaps will have melted and people will finally start taking climate change seriously By 2050, most major celebrities will be dead By 2060, we'll have gone to war with north korea and the massive debt we owe to their ally, china, will plunge us all into an inescapable depression likely to last forever. By 2100, humanity will probably go extinct.
7:09 you said astronaut instead of asteroid
if i survive to it the colonization of mars
7:10 The Astronaught?!       i know i spelt it wrong
Interesting, but I think you are being too pessimistic... but that's just my opinion... I'm seeing information that will mean many of your science predictions being fact within the next 12 years... exponential growth in technological advances that will affect human lives is about to hit the accelerator by 2020 and not let up for the next 30 years... much of it powered by the need to combat the effects of Climate Change, and Medical Conditions brought on by our societies changes brought on by the Robotic advances and AGI... Star Trek Replicator, satellite internet at gigabyte speeds, Regenerative Stem Cell Therapies. Nanobots for medical therapies by 2030 are just the tip of the iceberg (think reverse of the Titanic, unless you are an oil baron) Cheers...
I wanna be immortal..I wanna live forever...life is way too short for0 me.
I say stop time
half life 3 will not be released
all of this could be possible but we can't really see the future so some of this stuff in the video he said might not happen
Can’t wait for the iPhone 45
too vague
Why do you say too late for me is it because you’re kind a older than me
12:12.you said astronaut.not asteroid!😄😁😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣😂😂🤣😂😂😂😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣🤣😂
8:15 Aurora  Borealis
now we know...there will be no pole shift, nibiru doesn't exist..."bright side" implicitly said so...but....4:59....united states army will use electricity to INCREASE the soldiers reaction time?
Year 2026
Is genetic energy only for babies
More people will migrate to Africa
Too positive. People need to be aware of the distribution we are creating, so they can make better conscious decisions.
Artificial senses so I can get better at fortnite!!!!                                 Obviously. XD
6'1 billion people will see  BRIGHT SIDE
9 billion people.....😨😨😨😨😨
Charging with wifi?!
So your saying that before futurama years, we will be robots?
I heard 2050 there won’t be any chocolate
sucks for me I'm dying in about a year...
When will the global peace be sustained and all forms of atomic bombs with ammunition factories be sanctioned?
Inshallah
Also NASA will be sending the The biggest telescope to space in 2021
2050 I am going to 56 year's old that is what will happen
I will be 48 in the year 2050 so it sucks to be old now a days
Colonizing Mars
Is anyone ELSE scared about how synthetic life is becoming? 😨
What will happen is that hopefully Jesus Christ returns and saves us from ourselves.
To be honest I dont believe none of this because first of all how can he predict 2050 and how can we tell fututr that far and who knows if a ''mini ice age'' will happen its to far to predict.
"Mars needs women," Rob Zombie.
A space mission to a fairly undiscovered planet with people on board to colonize and explore, called “Aurora” *Hmm* Where have I heard that one before?  Luckily I don’t think were threatened by giant death lasers this time.
Sad/ scary truth is someone of us may not be alive to see 2050 come to life. And if 2039 is true then 🤬
The future finally sounds nice
Still no flying cars 😢
This is scary if you think about it, if we keep messing with technology, we are going to regret it
Haven't watched the video yet but does it involve us all dying? Because I'm totally here for that.
I wonder where we will do a poo poo in 30rys
Are there actually ppl blind enough to believe jfk was assassinated solely by lee harvey oswald?
Is it just me or does anyone else think Bright Side is from the future? Just a joke
I’ll be 47 in the year 2050
What will happen before 2050     WW3
What's with the two female washroom symbols as the thumbnail?
10:25 so we’re going to live forever
All I want is cybernetic limbs and to live longer.
When you most likely be alive in 2050..
I can't wait for internet charging
Life leaks
God I don't think I was born in the era I'm in now ... everything people predict in the 50s are now here for most part so it going to also happen in the future 😂
Why was there two women in the thumbnail there’s supposed to be a man on the right
Nice ad placement
What about in 3585 they will be candy crush so you can go inside the game anywoo YOU CAN EAT ALL THE CANDY YOU WANT
Im just glad you said you wont be needing chargers to charge device anymore!
oh thank god that we can go to mars in 32 years possibly we need to stop overpopulation, world hunger, and global warming. thank the gods unsubstantially...
Fortday is released 2051

Future is very scary, I prefer old days simpler and easier.
Breh were raping robots in the future 😂
I was thinking Michael Jackson would come back to life😂😂😂    RIP KING OF POP THE BEST LEGEND
Why 2029
Bright side your copying other people's work
What will happen in the year 2100?
I’m scared of overpopulation in on this planet.
11:35 human extinction
I am looking forward to seeing robots work efficiently
Events of 2050 if it comes in 2020 what will happen
At 2050 how many of us will be alive.... Those who are alive ping me here, Just say hi I'm alive,
2050.. ill be 55 years old is all i got from this, and maybe a good 25 years left.. most of us wont even see the year 2100

AND STILL NO CURE FOR BALDNESS!!!! :(
there will still be flat earth society
I live in Sharjah a place next to Dubai so I can’t wait to see the new building in 2020
Y will I be so old!!!!!
Why have we got to wait 6 years for WiFi charge
I am from Jeddah city thanks GOD we don't have crimes alcohols or drugs and we have almost everything for free for citizens like electricity water internet education hospitals universities studying out the country and many other beautiful things like when you gets married you gets a house and 200000 dollars from the government to help you because marriages here are very expensive and we have the most monthly payments in the world but if the city opened I don't know what going to happen
Death...
What will happend is humans will get older and older
Future, wish some of these things actually came true, but sadly, only the negative things will ALWAYS happen!
Everything that is there in 2050 could have existed already today if religion didn't exist, big companies and governments wouldn't prevent it (With copyright and so on) and we actually let us have these changes instead of be against them...
In the next year fortnite won’t be popular.
Welp at least i might survive till then i'll almost be 59 then only one year away and i am gonna be   60 yayy
The commentator makes me laugh every time😊😊😂😂😂😂
I don't think population will Increase
In the year 3010........
Im maybe crazy but some time when i sleep i dream about things en then a couple days later that dream happens
You saying astronaut but you were supposes to say astroid
I JUMPED WHEN THE GUY SAID MY NAME “AURORA” so cool!!
Will 6 BILLION PEOPLE actually all be at Starbucks?

Ahhh I'm scared for the futer
This is a lie
L
ugh there's too many people living on this planet
1980: we bet there will be flying cars in the future. 2018: this video.....
Everything is so scary!!!
There will be a clone of Donald Trump who will have his own VR prime time comedy show in 2047.
In 2024 India will be the country with largest population
LETS GO TO MARS!!!!!
Im in the year 8036 and nothing happened lol
Am I the only one who thinks this is all so messed up?
I'll live every year      Unless "something" happens
ENGLAND WILL BRING IT HOME!!
ALL Because i will BE 48 in 2050
U forgot to mention that at year 2050 half life 3 will be realised. Dissaspointed.
I look forward to the extinction of humans.
I Even Though All Hackers Will Be Killed Or Arrested In Hole Years
7:10 "The probability of the *astronaut* colliding with the earth..."
This is actually not depressing!
Humans will be extinct before 2200. Keeping eating meat, and it will happen. I guarantee it.
I'm scared for 2029
Best thing about 2025     I'll Graduate
I can see in the future but not furter then 7 days
... these so called.. civilised people...they’ll eat each other..
FREE DONUTS
Nope i aint letting anything happen to my brain
I have had dreams.that told me my future
And can you make more of this video
OMG I'm a big fan
I wish I could live in the future if there is like 10000 years immortality or something like that
8:14 I bet whoever came up with that had been watching Subnautica.😂
7:11 I think asteroid is the word you mean...😂
I want the mini ice age!
Woah, I'll be 50 years old!
After watching this I'm kinda afraid. I don't want to be a cyborg.
I think you lost your mind in 2018
Ill be 47 in 2050 😂
Earth is crowded enough plz help me I need my Star bucks
"Arctic ice sheet will be gone" Yeah, wasn't that already supposed to be the case? Yep 10 years ago they were calling for the arctic to be ice free this year meanwhile it has actually grown
the thing fun is to believe thats happening then EVEN MORE SCIENCE/truth comes and maybe a tiny bit of what he said comes true and where happy to believe him
I’m looking forward to a robotic girlfriend. XD
This is kinda scary
i look forward to the shortsightedness
We'll try to get the brain implants sooner
We should go to the asteroid and destroy it before it reaches us or pray to God that it will miss us.
Who want to watch this video in 2050?
I hit my head a few days after this comment and I had a vision that we will be in the orbit of próxima centurai the nearest star to earth 4.3 light years away excluding the sun to earth and we will probably be able to have implants in our brains to interact with objects in a virtual world without any equipment
Alpha Centauri is the planet in lost in space
So basically the New world Order
u forgot Fallout 76 release
Ran out of ideas so you created this video... Fine I'll give you the answer.           We will still be *humans*
who plays roblox then reply to me that when 2050 roblox will shut down XDDDDDDDDDD
I highly doubt that immortality will be possible or allowed by the law Its like saying wheres the cure for cancer
What about WW3?
No point putting any year over 2029 you said an asteroid will hit Earth so we will all be dead no point putting any year over 2029
Am probably going to be 43 years old by the time when it's 2050 now am 11
I hope we all get nuked to death before most of that happens
Did Starbucks sponsored this video
Solomon is my Mums last name lol
Some things are pretty scary!😨😨😨
By 2025 the econimy will have crashed and we will be held back 10 to 50 years

Year 2200, humans becomes time lords!! Doctor who <3
In afraid of 2029 years😥😥😥😥
I probably be dead
my question is?????? are we still gonna find thanos by 2050
Basically it becomes Futurama
I bet you’re one those people believe everything on Facebook:/
Actually the eye part is already here. Well in that eye sight can increase to eagle distance. It however isn't in America.
"The astronaut will collide with earth"

This is illegal to assume...
HOW U GET THE PICTURES IN THE FUTURE? IT DIDNT HAPPEN YET!!!!! LIESSS
I just like life like it is I don't want it to change even a bit
Honestly even though nobody gives a #### about my opinion, I believe everything you can imagine right now will progress slowly, however, I do not believe it will revolutionise the 'certain thing' your thinking about. The quote I live by "the more things change the more they stay the same' is freakishly accurate to how my life and the people around me have progressed over the last 30-40 years...
very optimistic. hope trump doesn't start a ww
androids are going to be real, and lets hope it dosent end up like 'Detroit: become human'
Mini ice age😍😍
Thank God only Norway will ban gas cars. I want a 24’inch jacked up 1990 ford 150 truck

I am excited for none of the above.
2020 also gives the year of the movies , No really a bunch of Amazing movies will come out in 2020
It will never come
For all the subnautica fans. 8:13
Geez, I really want immortality. I don’t care how much it costs and if it would be a scam. I would only be 36 which is still young in my book.
This video has a subliminal message: invest in coffee and invest in Starbucks.
Lets colinize mars!!! (I have no grammar)
Im ready for all death for humanity                                                                                                                                                                                                   jk
I look forward to that astroid hitting earth, i hope everyone dies. That would just be amazing right?
I'll be dead by 50 or 60 years old
Yet we dont have a cure for cancer
2020 or 2024 will happen the olympics in japan

I Like The One With Chargable Internet Connection
The singularity
Once it will be the year 2050 mars will be colonized. And I'll be either 49 or 50 during that time. Amazing but I don't think I'll be around on that mars colonization mission. But I might be able to go to space.
The Hyperloop project?
Dying sounds like a move right about now
Well now I don’t want to live thanks for that 👍
Will my toaster require wifi to function properly?
I would pick immortality
We'll be enslaved by fortnite
Ofcourse the word will end

Mars
Not realy realist 😉 i mean if it will be like this i prefere go living in the woods from now😞
dude it's almost impossible to tell the future so stop making these videos
all anime in the world will have new season
2046: "Terminator" happens, but the Terminators will simply be humans who've received AI implants and possibly gene sequencing
Big city's will have alot of light rail lines high speed rail in USA there will alot more of brightline will running trains to Tampa,Fla and Jacksonville,Fla  brightline taken over Amtrak or freight rail runs passenger trains again  ?

Will anyone actually come back to fact check this in 2050? Like if you think someone will, dislike if you think no one will check.
hmmm interesting
Future is sooooo scary
I think we should start to have restrictions on the amount of children people can reproduce. The world has enough resources for 11 billion people. I’m not a scientist, but anything after that, I think famine, dehydration, and other stuff may become much for common.
NON NOOOOOOO
the only thing i'm worried about is world hunger, and what if all power goes? It seems like we internet a lot now!
"winter is coming" 2034 august 15
how do you use electricity to improve intention span ? the heck is intention span ?
How will the population increase when we are already seeing a dramatic drop in birth rates?
4:55 increase? Not decrease?
A lot of us gne b dead. It's all good tho cuz we saw Trump make a mockery of politics, Drake beat the Beatles record, and I'm about to roll up so everybody wins.
In 2032 there will be WW3
I hope we don’t get hit by an asteroid
2050
7:13 he said astronaut, not asteroid
More people will have mobile phones than electricity in their homes? Good luck charging those phones.
7:12 Astronaut?
gene modification? artificial blood             Oh hax NAH
If the world even lasts that long..
*I'm scared...*
Going to mars
2025 - "outlaw gasoline powered cars"...right!  Like cars would fly by 2015.
Ice bird
Lets harvest the sun and other stars people cmon🤗

2050 The iPhone will be the size of a 20 inch Tv
What if ww3 happens
2033 the devs of subnatica called it
I know what will happen in 2022. The FIFA world cup will be completed with the win by Argentina.
In the year 2525, if man is still alive... he may find..
7:10 asteroid not astronaut 😂
Anyone watching in 2050?
In 2047 India celebrates 100th Independance  JAI HIND
They made new flies on jfk available already
This is going to be the worst planet to life on soon, people dont understand overpopulation and how people are going to be in the future, people cant even have 1 kid but instead they "need" 10 kids  because ever body cant control their weakness
So no country in Africa could create any substantial difference in the world? Also, everyone in the world except the people in Africa won’t be affected by those changes?
We are depending to much on gadgets..... and its already enough now!! We use it to do everything like homework..... LETS TRY AND MAKE A DFFERENCE!!!!!
I DONT want to look forward to electric cars only and I DONT want to look forward to how over populated earth would be
2019 is not that bad wait is the army finna turn into the Black ops 3 army

I'm gonna say the truth about BRIGHT SIDE right down below. (WARNING: YOU MIGHT UNSUBSCRIBE)   1. BRIGHT SIDE might have good videos 2. BRIGHT SIDE has copied some other people's videos 3. BRIGHT SIDE has also copied thumbnails 4. BRIGHT SIDE might say they it's theirs but it's not true 5. BRIGHT SIDE should ask permission before posting videos 6. BRIGHT SIDE should choose other thumbnails for videos 7. BRIGHT SIDE might have different words in their videos but it's still copying 8. BRIGHT SIDE copied videos and other YouTubers said that BRIGHT SIDE copied their videos and it's true  so I am not a hater I'm just telling the truth and now you know the truth. :)
Robotic eyes I want 1

Bright side man sounds like swagger souls
Nooooooooooo whyyyyyy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

honestly, this video is slightly scary because I'm only 12 years old I'm going to be graduating in 2024 just at age 19 so ill be in my late 50s in the year 2050
2025 black opps 2 will happen
More people isn't a good thing because if we keep multiplying the population, we are going to starve, and what are the chances of ww3 from happening?
Hey if we start to try to understand technology there is a minimal chance we will be able to understand technology if you catch my drift. But you know watching this kinda makes me scared of the future.
I’m looking for the simplicity and freedom in life. Future were too complicated for me.
If u know basic science obviously any technology will be about flooding in the futute
Interesting yet very hard to believe 🤔🤔
If you want The Creator to laugh at you, just tell Him your plans.
Google , Im Ready :)
You need to do a video on how gaming will progress in the next 30 years i think thatd be interesting
I live in jeddah 😃😃😃
I honesty don’t like the ideas of that kind of stuff. I like things the way they are.
"The probability of the Astronaut colliding with the earth.." I know continuity is hard but how do you miss this in editing? haha, love the vids guys!
HOW DOSE HE KNOW THIS PEOPLE DONT CARE
I will be 25 by 2030 😂😂😂

2020 = beginning of COD Advanced Warfare.
I’m actually Entertained

Definetly mars
In short words: Nothing will happen in 2019, 2020, 2024, etc etc.
I believe in not just climate change but in global warming due to where I live. But this @ 9:01 seems to completely contradicts the events @ 6:15 & 7:41.
your a little late on some of these things.
1. Well there be a chance if people can create half human and half animal? or know as Anthro...  2. Can we travel to other dimensions?  And 3. Can we travel to other worlds?   Ps. Some of the the things that you said are not right... Gas well be not banned from what year you said... is not right Gas well not be ban by the whatever it you said... We have gas powered machines...
The electric car and WiFi charging
I’m looking forward to the Ice age because of this whole global warming stuff.
I don’t want to live to 2050 anymore....
wo0ow clickbait how fun
Now I have to say that this is AMAZING. But there are problems. as well like global warming, increase in population and dependence of people on technology.
Elder Scrolls 6

This video is so depressing

And all of you guys and lady's tell Jesus to not end the world in 2029 please
I bet anybody here 5 cents that D.W. from Arthur will be first on mars.
I will try my best to make sure that I see all of these innovations, which won’t be very hard if there are significant increases in life expectancy.
The only part i want to happen now is the faster internet.
God if I'm still getting a Starbucks coffee in the year 2050 that will show how well the company is doing lol
On 2050 Kratos is already Dead and BOY will be a new God of WAR!

I don't like that
mini ice age like that will happen with global warming  *um it probably will be extreme heat*
In my opinion for 2025 I hope we get hoverboards from Back to the Future the movie

Ima be 45 when we all move to mars😀😀 ill still be kinda young but not that young. . . BUT WILL THERE BE FORTNITE ON MARS😂👍
WHAT Will a asteroid hit earth?!?!?!
Evolution. People didn't have microwaves or vacuums at one time either. So we can expect for there to be more surprises along the way. The idea that we are evolving to become a sort of robot-like human so that we can travel to colonize on other planets occurred to me very recently. I hadn't thought about it before. I guess when I was reading about scientists trying to determine whether or not AI can be conscious really got my mind putting things together. I started thinking.. are they trying to turn the human race into robots? Essentially? I think it's pretty interesting. I don't see robots "taking over the world", but rather, we become those robots taking over another planet.

omg this girl on utube said she's a time traveler and she said she travaled to Mars and she said it was like the year 3018 and  she said humans were living there and there were flying cars and houses but she said mostly Asian people were living there
None of this will happen at those times, people thought we would have flying cars by now, but no
this is another case of, a few wealthy want this, so the world is forced to accept against their will... best thing going for us is history teaching us, every time a civilization starts to get a bit to cocky, arrogant and advanced, they crumble and fall,and some even left with no trace such as Troy and Carthage...
The astronaut? 7:11
Why can’t that 1000x faster internet happen now
He said astronaught does that mean there is still chance we can all fie

Oh, my. This happened last time; when and if that Jeddah Tower is hit by a plane, you'll become part of a conspiracy.

Trains won’t be a thing by 2040

I'm definitely NOT looking forward to that massive asteroid hitting the planet!!!!!!!
I hope the world ends.

Catalonia will be an Independent Country around year 2025-2028
in the year 2050 shortsightedness will not be cured ? what about all that wonderful technology you have mentioned ? will not be able to correct myopia without the need of wearing glasses ?
I am most excited to see Artificial Intelligence consume our world. Will we be ended? Or will we enter a new age of scientific miracles given to us by our benevolent overlords? Either way, it will be fascinating.
Y am i born in this century...
We grow up.
Great one !wanna see all of the events but I don’t wanna see WW3  let’s join our hands to make this beautiful world even more beautiful ever in the universe. God bless.
I'm so scared
I really really want to visit Dubai. It looks amazing!
2001 a space odyssey.  btw non of this will happen, go to sleep.

i was looking forward to living on the moon rather than mars
yup man and machine must become one.
I’m gonna hang myself in 2030
Ireland and most of Western Europe will be Muslim and black by then.  I'm guessing it'll be like those countries , like African civilisation , or rather lack of it.    Advances in technology will slow , after a time like a bell curve when this happens .  After Africanization of Europe its over. Back to the stone age within a few years
Destruction and genocide of the white race and with it European  civilization .   A total changed society , full of degeneration and disease .   Complete communism , no family(we see its been eroded already ) .State owns all workers .   In this epoch many people will have cancer and lose their sanity after years of drug abuse ,which became more common.People are lazier ,and dumber as a result .   Easily beaten when in a weakened state , societal change occurs.   Or a national socialist revolution prevents all this degeneration? Who knows , but I'll fight for the latter .
It's a strange thing ... no one likes the way things are to turn out, but who is to change the it all but the people who do not like? Computers will speed up this process. Much of this & more will occur before 2050. I sort of feel sorry for people 20-25 or younger. they have a chance (chronologically) of living to the end of this century. Life on planet Earth will have grown incredibly weird by then ... if they live at all.
in 2051, Half-life 3 will be release
ew
Does that mean I can marry my TV now?
The probability of the "astronaut" hitting earth
But....... I Want a normal life.....

I am looking forward to when they send people to the alapha centauri system
As long as Youtube and twitch are still around I'm hyped!
To see a real alain
2050 It looks cool
With how society is now - I think the movie Idiocracy is far more likely to become the realism then what this timeline predicts, but maybe I'm wrong.
I am honestly scared
by 2050, people will have extended their lifetime by 40 years, making it possible to live to 120 way easier. You just have to look at  quality memes daily.
You mentioned not even one word about flying cars which are already available for purchase. It seems like flying cars are of immediate significance since common use of them is very much indeed "right around the corner".
Goin to mars
The ratio of women to men would be 5 to 1 by 2050. So men should have 5 wives..

people will be older
I'm fine with the present
the future is crowded and depressing
How do they know any of this?
White people will realise their been conned and separate.
dude if you think Oswald killed Kennedy you need to get a life
Alien planet and tampering don't y'all get it yet this is what earth is ! Continuous exploration of humanity for planetary advance ! Doesn't always means advance is the best social way the concerns are also real .
IPhone11
global warming or mini ice age? you are giving contradictory future predictions.
I’m terrified that scientists won’t find a cure for no death of old age or the earth will get hit by the asteroid and a bunch of crazy things will destroy earth and I am scared of what lies behind death
It’s all looking good so far  Until 2028  and 2029 and 2030 and 2035
i graduate in 2025.....
Why would you make a hotel in space find out new stuff and see if there is a new solar system out there

Mars
All these whiny cowards complaining about technology. These are exiting stuff for alert and agile brains looking forward into their lives.
Some amazing things coming. I look forward to all of them. It just sounds as though humans will eventually become inhuman. This very great technology sounds good but in many ways some of it is not so good.
This sounds so cool, hope it happens
:( I just want a normal life

The huge growth of Elvis impersonators means by 2019 one third of us will be impersonating Elvis. So by 2050 half the world population will become Elvis impersonators.

Bionic eye,  nerves repairing, working thermonuclear tokamak and cheap sollar panels and batteries are the best, and hope it'll come to reality soon enough.

Deafness being cured because I have hearing loss
Or something even better that human beens can not even imagine... And something that the human kind will NOT be able to handle, more severe natural disasters, people will be more selfish, grid, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of the true GOD... some countries like japan, Washington, Victoria Canada, Alaska,, baba California will extinguished by tsunamis or another natural disasters... And many more selfish 💩💩💩💩 'cause honestly the ruler of this World, the devil or s****n, wants us to become 💩.  FORTUNATELY GOD will not allow that the humans themselves and the devil lead us to the filthy hole.

In 2019 Puurs-Sint-Amands will be a city in Belgium
A zoo without cages...hmmm I wonder where all the zebras are? Maybe I should ask the lion. Also a zoo without cages it would be like a National park reservation
Oh...
2050 because I've been dreaming about Mars
2050 linux finally has 0 vulnerabilities

Solar pannels and electric cars
Mans gotta love his WiFi charge😂

This may be too late for some of us.
The European Union will not exist in 2050.

Interesting.
right. so how about the political climate and liberals destroying the western world. will there even be the west left by the year 2050 or is it just islamisation and terrorists.
How do you know this stuff?!
Maybe we’ll just have to wait until 3018 before we get Star Trek in real life (as in artificial gravity generation and fully functional teleportation)!
I was afraid a lot of things would be bad. But this gives me a brighter outlook on the future. Thanks
I want charging with wifi.
For those baby boomers out there, New Caledonia is where the imaginary town of Taratoupa supposedly was in McHale's Navy. Singular = prosthesis; plural = prostheses. Thermonuclear, not thermonukyuler. If I remember correctly, every time in this video that a decimal was mentioned, a comma was used instead of a period. (??)
in 2050                            people will finally use their brains properly, no offense...
Maybe in 2045 I'll finally find a girlfriend

I can't imagine what 2100 would be like. Wish I was born in like 2040  so I could see it
7:12 - 7:13 : he says astronaut when he's talking about asteroids!
some of thiese seem very unlickly but most of them seem like they could happen
You stole a lot of this from mind warehouse...
Yea, the polar ice cap thing is bunk to, probably baught into global warming bunk. Ice cap right now is at it's largest in recorded history.
I honestly think it's sad all this electronic stuff it's like taking over the world and I'm just a teen and I even think this
2050

*squeals* The Sagrada Familia is like 8 years ahead of schedule! (last I checked like...3 years ago)
This uploaded in my bday
the mars landing
fake
These are too optimistic predictions to me. There will be shortage of water. Many landlocked countries will turn into deserts.
I can definitely wait for the population to become larger. I hope I die before that happens and reincarnate as a better animal, but I don't think that'll happen anytime soon, unfortunately. I wish humans could just go extinct or maybe all humans could become infertile, does anybody else agree or am I the only one? Or am I just crazy? Who knows!
Cheeeeezzzzzzzz
When is despacito 2 coming out?... Pls...Tell me now this instant.I know this since Vladimir Putin and Donald trump comfirmed it. sooo I'm still waiting 😢😢

"Nobdy can predict the future."
"I am not willing to have a brain implant as much as have the choice."
In 2050 ill be in my late 40's early 50's
I am DEFINITELY gonna be one of the people lined up at star bucks
I hope we get to teleport back in time or wherever
Black Mirror will become a documentary.

I look foward to the fastest internet
Who's watching in 2050 right now and laughing at this video?
So they could transplant minds but can't cure nearsightedness !!!! Seems sooo true to me !
Please post and update in 2050 if humans are still watching videos as we do.  I just put the reminder in my smartphone in the cloud so it’s safe and sound.  Also have a day before reminder. 👍. So far away but will be here before we know it.
Im watching this and I’m thinking when will the guy talking die

The world needs to have a rule that you’re only allowed to have up to 2 children to combat overpopulation unless a purple dude comes along and destroys half of all life in the galaxy
Project Aurora!

The 2025 ban on gas cars in Europe is way to optimistic..
How does he know anything that will possibly happen in the future?and beyond? 1like=agreed
4:58 "increasing their reaction time" why would you increase that? Wouldn't you wanna decrease it??
before 2050 humans will forget how to speak to each other as they will have there brains wired to there smartphones
Oh no I’m from dk 😦😧😧
Welp.. looks like history class is gonna be a lot harder for my grandkids!  P.s I’m  Excited for the thing that makes us not age as much
Thay wont be human thayll he peoppe..  People are robots clones .. Humans are not and of u dont wake up humans  well he wiped out
At 4:58 he said that the electricity would increase their reaction time. I’m not sure if that was a mistake or that they will actually just react very slowly.
What will happen before 2050? 2049.
Anyone from the distant future of 2050?
mars :>
That wont happen because Jesus Christ is returning soon to judge the wicked.
Does anyone actually think modify our brain is just a bit odd
is it bad that none of this is actually interesting to me. i kinda dont want to go through all these years
Like this comment if you are watching this video in 2050.
Why is everyrhing perfect? You didn't predict WWIII, eventhough it's actuallt likely to happen within that time frame. If -- or when -- it does, everything else you predicted that comes after may be very different ir not happenen at all.
i wonder if trump is gonna be Revived when dies ;P
OML DATS SCARES ME ALOT T^T
THATS NOT HOW U SAY SAUDIA ARABIA
false assumptions, read Bible pray repent be born again, linked vids my account
This channel spits out so much BS, yet I watch every video...
I dont know why i watch this i 11 years old
Who else is watching this in 2050?
I wonder in 2058 they might make the oasis from ready player on and everybody will play ir
I'm still alive after 2050
To sum up this vid. Lots of building will be done and lots of energy will be used
i dont like the idea of messing with human biology
Umm how you know the future it's fake and it hit Mars a month ago
How will the Arctic ice melt completely during summer in 2030 , yet in 2035 earth will experience a mini ice age ?
Too much technology. -_-
In 2038 we have Cyberlife Such as Connor,Markus,And Kara
Like if you don’t like the future
you reduce reaction time,,,,, what you increase is reaction speed ,not time ( 4:57 )
halo
a time of AI robotic simulator test will be launched
How will they charge the smart phones without electricity
In the year 2028 the time machine would be made public.

Teleportation

I will be watching this in 2050 and be laughing
I’m excited for the androids
if in the future is a machine that can erase something in our mind like fear then I want it
1958: We will have flying cars in the future  2018: Electric cars good enough technology is getting better!  2050: *Jets on roads*
You said about the 'Mars One Project' which is, according to me the most amazing prediction and I'll surely look forward to this.
I probably won’t live to see it because I live in the United States and another video I seen said that the United States will likely be completely destroyed by 20 to 40 years from now :(
Wait, they just said that there was a 2.4 chance of that rock hitting earth but it was ruled out. It never said that it become more of a chance a I’ve ember heard of any of this. I believe most of this is fake
The feminists will the destroy the world?
That is a big change of gender
There was a movie on Aurora called Singularity
By 2050 Europe and America will become entirely Islamic countries
Teleportation! I would telepor to lidl.
In 2020 Islam with be the largedt religion in the World YAY 😄
I am just young enough that i might live long enough to see how many of these you got right. in 2050 i will be 63 and it is even possible that if I do manage to live that long and longer that I might even make it to 2100 due to advancements in medical and tech.
I'll be 48 years old in the year 2050, what age will you be if you are still alive?
If pollution continues It is possible we will see over 30% of the ocean dry out in 4000  If we keep fishing we may see ocean life die out in 5000  in 2100 It is possible that humans will have tails you can see one in the skeleton
2035 mini ice age!!! anyone?
No one can tell the future except God.
I love the guy commentating ♥
Feel so old
I will 43
i’d rather see the past than the future
In the 2050 I will be 45 years old soo yaaay I am gonna live thru all of this and that asteroid sooo...

I really hope bubble tea & sushi will still exist in the future :O
Oh god the audio quality

i dont like the sound of this it sounds like a baby could just have an injections and then act like adult
Aliens will be in the Future!
The title is deceptive.
All these are if nothing goes wrong or changes.
I'm looking forward to the 1000× faster wifi ;) Edit: if i get gamer kids that say why is the wifi so bad i'll tell them the story of wifi now XD

every night i dream the next day
Aurora, does it remind you something 🤔
Cool
Still no time travel machine in coming years?
Alpha Centurie and aroura and my manned mission to mars.
2051 The feminists take complete control 😂 Jk I couldn’t resist
Nothing will happen guys slightly things will be different but no flying cars and stuff like that
I’m looking for a robotic sexmate before I die
Anyone else hope to die before anything like disasters happens like no water a volcano or an Asteroid? Or is it just me?
In year 2020maby i will graduate on collage maby
2024
I’m looking forward to all the new drugs that will be invented
Deaf can be cured
Disability care
Fake!!!!!!!!
After watching old films like metropolis and documentaries about the future filmed in the 1930s, I can see that today is nothing like it was predicted. The human race is getting dumber and greedier. The planet is headed for self destruction, trees are being cut down in over 50% of the world, ship loads of waste has been dumped in the oceans over many years, doctors and pharmaceutical companies are making people sick, fake food is being made in China and the USA and China is taking over Africa
I'm Danish
why do a plane going through Jeddah tower, you racist
Advance magisip!😂😂
I feel like we’re getting to smart for our on good. I don’t think it will be good in the long run.
I hate watching futuristic things cause it shows me there is probably no hope for humanity and I want to die even more
😺😺😺😺🙀🙀
Investor in Tesla much?
100 years ago it was said that around this time we would have flying cars and an illustrated world that looks way more futuristic than the present 🤧
I will be 46 in 2050.
Nuclear...
Tell me some of the bad stuff :/
I hope jupitur will save us
Sometimes I dream the future day (next day)
Wow, most of this is more exciting and less apocalyptic than I thought. I expected to see predictions like:  -A Soviet-style collapse of the US -The possibility of a World War III -Las Vegas becomes one of many "ghost metropolises" abandoned due to lack of water -Winter sports increasingly take place indoors due to climate change -Worldwide famine and refugees due to food shortages -Extinction of nearly 50% of all animal species
Alpha Centauri....!
I'm waiting for the mini ice age
2026 when Google will invest to make the internet 1,000 times Faster can't wait to see that happen!
You guys think this is fake but it's not he may not be on point with everything but if you are not brainwashed and look at things with a deeper eye and know how powerful these man in suits are your fooling yourself if u think something big wont change our world. Something will happen so get your money and family set so you have a fighting chance...
exciting
everything is planned. please include my daughter's. she wants to be austronaut. :)
For the tallest building most of the top will be thin and useless
Dubailand gonna get bombed like every week
Year 2050 robots take over the world like the movie terminator 😂😂
Omg this scares me so much
give me my teleportation already
We're all gonna die😵😵
I'm so ready for 2019
I live in Norway
DEFINITELY the Bionic eyes being commercially available. That would be AMAZING for blind people.
We need to put a stop to new technologies or it’s going to ruin us.
Don't you have any negative shi* to say about the future ? All but positive bullcra* !
I'd be 42 when its the year 2050
Lets go Denmark
By 2050, I'll be Forty Five.
But I'll probably die
I like to sing to cure death
In 2050 i will be 47
Google
Over 90 than all I hope my rollator will have internet connection and a nice sexy nurse robot takes care of me 😁
I’m gonna be 42 in 2050 ._.
*_Google internet gets 1000 times faster_*

I'm looking forward to 2036 with bionic eyes
I’m gonna die in 2104 for sure (i’m born on 2009)
Someone In my class is named Aurora
do all animal die in 2050?
Sorry for my language  "Kailan uunlad ang pilipinas"
By the year 2050 we no longer have children we have become one gender known as daom or moad we have all children on a lab that are genetically perfect and run solely on Starbucks, and smartphones
You broke the YouTube video law, always convert feet and metres... come on... 😢
Internet being 1000 times faster
2050 I’ll finally get a life..         Maybe
Wow internet 1,000 times faster? Is that even possible?
Me...I'm just hoping that Google will make internet 1k faster
How about after 2050
1000x internet
I would rather to stay in this time then getting that far...
who believe GOD
What about the Spice Melange?
This vid made me rethink my life and not want to stop being a child
Can't wait for ww3
I will never allow my appliances to use wifi. Privacy is dying enough as it is.
We should already be in an ice age but no we humans are greedy idiots who only know how to play the shortgame and refuse to learn and play the long game thus global warming
* reads title* advancements in technology and possibly less garbage in the ocean and possibly bringing back extinct species.
answer: nothing
That game Red Faction seems to be coming true
More indian scammers coming your way
Going by the thumbnail i guess there will be no mens washrooms.

He forgot something on the year 2020 the new TESLA ROADSTER!
This just makes me sad and disappointed to be a human in this time period
In 20 years these predictions will look as rediculous as the Jettsons did about the year 2000.
8 billion earth people will all be in line at StarBucks?  8 billion people minus one!  I never go to StarBuck, never will.  ... Come to think of it, you might want to minus 11, my family never do either.
i want to die
1 billion people per year?! Really?! I hate humans.
IN THE FUTURE 1THOUSAND POUNDS IS LITTLE
Did only I got dissapointed because I will be freaking nearly 50 years old in 2050 ??> so alone ;(
It bothers me how a plane flies past when it’s talking about the tallest building...
I will not like the future because my mom dad uncle and he said astronaut not astroid and i cant wait in season 400 on fartnite and gta v1 so im happy that trump wont be alive and my dog will be dead :( to much eletronics for us why oh well

Bionic eyes pleaseee!!!!! Can't we take care of our own which we have been blessed with.....!!!?? I am so unlucky!!!! Why did I have to be a part of this generation ??!!!

Back to the future 4...  Were going back to 2016 Marty! It turned out different than we expected!
I look forward to the second coming of Jesus Christ, when the beast controls humanity.
In 2045 Jesus comes back to save us from ourselves and returns humanity to technology from 1999. The Prince song will be wildly popular.
Ya aaa more life to 150 years and more
If the asteroid hits in 2029 before that we can get a space shuttle and pack stuff and move away with the space shuttle. PROBLEM SOLVED!

143 years is not as long as the Duomo. That was built in 400 years!
also this all will happen only if society get rid of people like Trump, Farage and Putin If not.... Idiocracy (movie 2006) screenwriting is most probably to happen with more celebrity bullshiters in the office
In the year 2050, the Elder Scrolls VI trailer 2 is announced

Think about nature more and more animals will be extinct it's time for the world to END before we wreck what god made for us
I'm only 11 we are just wrecking the world . and I think when it's so high tech it's possible the things we are putting into are body could make are lives shorter
Saying, "that's a man," will become illegal/hate speech.
YOU KNOW WHAT 😂 a lot of this sounds like the 100 and I know how that story ends soooo I’m good 💀

Every other person will be confused about their gender and will be transgender?

It didn't talk about scientific progress in human understanding. We will understand how humans work, and this may spawn big social revolutions. A New Enlightenment is coming.
143 years is a reasonable time for a medieval cathedral.

I hope they make androids...      And they'll start a revolution.
Bionic eye will be on my number one to get on my list
7:15 he said astronaut not asteroid
7:11 "The probability of the ASTRONAUT colliding with earth...." he says that right? but it's astroid. *facepalm*
You know wait I do not want to live in 2050 now I hard that
I'll be 53 by 2050 and you?
Those born after 2020 may live through the 22nd Century?...

As soon as the first women president is  elected I hope I’m not around to see that
NOTHIN!!!!!
Charging Electronics using Wi-Fi
What about World War 3 ?!
I'm not really scared in 2050 cause I will only be 41 years old..
Singularity!

But hey, we can live longer
I’ll miss venice

I can't wait for 2050
Aurora borealis
WOW
When everyone die I hope everyone go to heaven
At 7:12 he said astronaut instead of astroid
A space ship called aura goes to space hope it ain't going to end up like the aura in subnatica
Before 2050 it'll be proven that Global Warming aka Climate Change is a complete hoax 😎
7:08 I'm just glad the astronaut won't collide with earth
And in 1984 we thought we'd all be puttering around in electric, flying cars and living in the sky like the Jetsons....  And another billion people in 6 years with a declining global birth rate?  I don't think so.  These videos are getting super dumb now.
I feel like teleportation will never happen
What do you think about some thing out of like Sao (sword art online) happening?
7:11 he says the probability of tje astronot colliding with earth 😂 not asteroid.
I want a camera in my eye . Say goodbye to the gopro
Answer to title:      Hopefully the rapture.
LOL AURORA FROM SUBNAUTICA
Interesting...
My reaction to everything: ;_;’
We're 17 years away from an ice age and yet the Arctic circle will be gone by the end of the century?....... Makes sense.....
Maybe if they cure my paralysis they would be cool but I would never want to give up the autism because that's a different way to think autism is not a disease
Ok you don't know if this will all happen unless you have a time machine or the Illuminati said all of this to you
Btw apophis isnt gonna destroy all life on earth its prolly gonna take out a full country as big as the us tho if it hits
Worst thing to ever happen...   Brain Implants or Chips, or form of Tech, that comes complete with Advertisements we can't turn off, or get rid of, & thus cloud our judgements working forwards in life, oO   I would hate to just go for a walk, & randomly be hit with 20,000 Adds, I can't turn off, simply because they are burned into my brain, ~_~   With computers, you can simply close your web browser, but with tech inside your head, you can't simply close any windows, ~_~ Your stuck with it, oO
7:12 said astronaut instead of asteroid.
Ill be 55 2k50 not bad still
The Future Is not yet set... There is no Fate, but what we make, jk, ^_-   The Future will rise up, & we will witness the end of Days, jk, lOl… =D
mars colonization

For all the people who think we are all gonna die in the next years. DO NOT BELIEVE THIS DUDE!! He will make you end your life in a snap or you will be worried for life! It’s okay! This guy just wants views! Or he was predicting. I’m not saying he is an idiot, or anyone! I am trying to make you guys feel better!! Thank you for reading this
Ok i'm happy and sad💖 i'm kind of scare of the future
I'm hoping for vehicles that are taken off of gas and oil and become electric, diseases that can be cured, life starting on some other planet and it would be nice if by 2050 there is more truth and knowledge about aliens and where they come from. Oh and if there is a way to becoming immortal that would be cool.
Omg I’ll, be 50 in 2050
Hey what about the Oasis
How do u know these stuff ;-;?
2019
Sooo I was born 2006 so I’m 12 the thing is once I’m old enough for people to die at this age I’ll be able to live to 200
I know what might happen in 2038 human androids will be there
This vudei us fake news. No one knows the future accept God himself.
I don't wanna live on mars
buttsex
charge using wifi? You lost me there...
The magic eight ball said, "try again tomorrow". At 7:12 he calls the asteroid an astronaut.....
This much technology cant be good
Hi. OH Im From 2100
The one that will help u.s. army will   ruin fortnite lol
You forgot to include how Raul Menendez attacks the US.

Bs
I'll be old by than lol I'll be 44 that's older than my mom now if I'm being honest I would rather be born when people live on  mars and everyone's immortal
Mars colonies. Finally my own space that I can fly across the cities of mars.
I'm scared what hapends when people fall out the earth

Ice age
I’d be 13
Colonization of Mars...
When in 2050 people will still thinking memes
i know one thing that wont happen before 2050 - england winning the world cup
I think a lot of this stuff will not happen. For ex. the sending people to Mars. In 2003, people thought that it would happen in 2018. Now, we think it will happen in 2033. So basically it will still take about 15 years? IT WAS SUPPOSED TO TAKE 15 YEARS 15 YEARS AGO. Also, CONOLIZING Mars? ?"??????????????????? I don’t think that will ever happen, and if it does, it will be in many, many years. Also, brain transplants? Dont we understand, like, only 30 percent of the brain NOW? Well if all of this does happen, I tip my hat to you, Bright Side
I will be 45
You forget Transportation   Rail road will speed at least 300 MPH     and The aerospace plane  will be available  No I do not feel cars will be all electric  cars  that soon.   Maybe the New electric cars if they sell cars reasonable enough  price. There many who can not afford a car these days.   yes If Cars or any road or off the vehicle  does become all electric  What we do with all the gasoline? I can understand Hydro electric car   { the type of vehicles that give off water vapor or steam)  plus the charging stations Systems must be   give a quick charge.
My mind is blown by this video! Seems like there are going to be a lot people in the world, f**king 9 billion!!?
I will be 48 in 2050
Da fuu Denmark
Charging your phone with WiFi! Now that's cool and useful
Not really that excited, gonna die early anyway
Going to the Dr for robotic implants to be a cyborg
I'm glad that I won't live in that world. I'm old-fashioned   like the nature and little things like snow, sun and rain and ordinary human life,  thank you for the peek in the future but no thank you   go there without me
I'll be 49 years old. So sad
2029 asteroid impact to earth ofcourse i hope it hit so we can get out of here finally.
I'll be around by 2050-2002=52
What's the difference between quantum teleportation and normal? We already have teleportation, although its minuscule at the moment with small items. Russia for the win!
Isn't this the same channel that said human beings will evolve..
Aurora is my name is aurora kyaw wow I was surprised
Gah I can't wait!!
Im scared about the asteriod :(
A mini ice age? How catastrophic would that be.
I will be a man in 2019
ill be looking forward to the mini ice age and self driving cars
In 2050 I’ll be a 53 year old man :/.
But Can People Go On Another Planets?
Hey,my sekaii sensei
Sounds pretty cool...change is good
you'll never charge a phone using wifi
Leave a like if u are thai cuz the zoo with no cages is in thailand bruh
Thailand already has 1 zoo that has no cages -_- :/ This is awkward btw
9 billion that is very small compared to earth
Internet it's gonna be 100 time faster
I feel really old watching this now but I'm only 18
We live on a Flat  Domed Earth. No Space travel.
Anyone else notice how he said Will colide with the astronaut not astroid? lol
I'm so glad that I'm not going to be around for all this horror ....they have no idea what this is all going to do ....brain implants? Yeah ok have fun being a good little robot.
No one has to believe me but my dreams come tru
What will happen in 2070? Earth will be lifeless due to oceans of plastic
Starbucks is evil...
It's all the signs of the end of the WORLD...
I just want to charge my phone with WiFi
i dont wanna live in Mars maybe theres an alien underneath that planet because there was a nuclear bombing in mars and they are hiding underneath mars for millions of years ago... i think hahaha        just my opinion
How do people know what year it is? IT COULD BE 727481 RIGHT NOW
I don't like this future im sacred now
How do you know?
i will be 43 in 2050
I can't wait for 2025
These are all lies
hopefully by 2050, they will know who killed JFK
i really doubt we will make it to 2050...check out the world clock
2:10 elephant pis lol
I think that you forgot what will turn out to be many dozens of elements being discovered
Apparently an astronaut has a 2.9% chance of hitting us in 2029
I was yelling theese in my house its 11 PM
How about the animals? Oh god, mutations will happen
The eyes
And i would buy a plasma railgun for safety
I wanna live on mars in the future because it would be cool to live on another planet
7:12 “...the astronaut” LOL
I highly doubt the electric brain stimulation prediction.
I look forward to selfdriving cars becoming accurate enough not to require a licensed driver to be in them when operating. My sight is poor enough that I cannot drive myself and it would be amazing to be able to transport myself without relying on others. I also look forward to technology which would drastically improve my eyesight. Advanced contacts would be great. However, I would remain blind if seeing meant I wouldswould have to have my eyes cut out and replaced with bionic ones. I'm just not comfortable with that thought. Then again, bionic eyes would likely be useless to me considering my blindness stems from the optic nerves not developing correctly rather than something in the eye itself. At least I'll likely be alive in 2050. Crazy to think I'll be turning 59 in that year; eeek! The crazier thing is to think that my little niece would turn 38 the same year... AAAAAH, NOOOOOO! She's already growing up too fast!!!
Zombies Apocalypse😱
We're makeing AI's to smart
Im watching this im 12 year old i really dont understand how bright side😂
No one's worried about the ant-Christ
The future isn't ours to see. One can only good guess whatever's coming next. I do believe there's going to be a third world war; a nuclear bomb exchange. It's ourselves we need to enhance, not technology. Regards. U.K
In 2050, humanity will finally receive super powers from an alien meteor; trillions of galaxies away.
DETROIT: BECOMING HUMAN
Wish I would be still living here with all the future changes ahead man I was born too early😬✋
i'll live till 2100
Discounting future wars, large epidemics, inflammation, starvation, and etc. the future sounds great.

LOLOLOLOL I CAN STILL LIVE IN ABOUT 2050 WOOHOOOOO
I graduate in 2020
2020 Kanye
Before 2050, humans will Potatoes.
I want my aunt back
Also let's leave all evil people behind when we get space travel
The mini ice age might happen to certain places but 9 billion people will not happen for a REAL long time but the tesla car may reach more sales than that and colonies on mars prob Will be made in 2051 or higher cuz of society today and greedy people who want to hold people back so that they can have slaves
NOTHING IS TRUE IN THIS VIDEO !!!!!!!!!!!!
I will live till then so we will see if this is true... If i remember this video till then😃
I would be 46 in 2050

Before all predictions  come true hope world should sservive  till that time.
Let's survive 2029 .. july 13 then will think about 2050
We're just nonchalantly going to mention a mini ice age and teleportation and move right past those things? 😂😂 also, where's the cure for diabetes and cancer? All these things accomplished and we still can't fix these?
The ice age
Maybe American will use the Metric system..
I don't want to live in the future
Sala Kal ka weather nahi Bata sakte ho aur 2050 ke bare me Bata rahe ho😕😕😕

I am little nervous after seeing this video because my parents will not be with me after 25to 30 years. I want the time to be stopped in present only.😶😦
What about Androids? I am curious if they’re gonna be made in the near future
You TOTALLY FAIL to comprehend the meaning of the coming "Singularity".  It's not, as you glibly dismiss it, about technology becoming so complex we all just sit around shaking our heads in amazement.  We are contemplating possibly the single most profound event in human history.  The human species is about to create its own successor.   Artificial Intelligence, redesigning and reprogramming itself, directing its own evolution, will  outstrip human intelligence the way we overshadow ants and bees.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote about this fifty years ago.  (Look up a copy of his "Profiles of the Future.").  Twenty-five years ago Vernor Vinge spelled it out in detail.  Read and be afraid.  Be VERY afraid.  https://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/book98/com.ch1/vinge.singularity.html
I hope it uses thorium
Hover boards cars trucks shoes and more
Good to know the “probability of the *astronaut* colliding with the earth in 2029” is extremely low. That means we won’t have to worry about giant space farts coming too close to us. 🤣🤣🤣 7:10-7:22
I cant wait that all missions about space what you said
In 2050 Fortnite will be broke !!! LOL
I look forward to going to mars but not the chance of the asteroid hitting earth and the sight of robots taking over earth.Lol

Scientists don't know when the earth ends only God and Jesus know Tru🙏
THEY FOUND A NEW CONTINENT

Interesting look into our possible future. Very Entertaining to watch
Where are food problems? We will eat insects in 2025.

Who’s gonna be really mad if this stuff happens in a different year than it said in the vid. ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!
You guys should make a series called DARK SIDE and another one called BRIGHT SIDE
in 22 years humans have moved to outside this galaxy bc of memes and political correctness ( jokes aside nothing will have happened with the human race in 22 years)
Living until 2050 will be great fore me as I am 73 now.
I hope nothing happened like this
I just hope everyone in this world is equal by 2050. No racism, sexism, homophobia, just everything bad gone.
Lol. "2019. Ohhh that's next year."
Hiccup at 4:25?!
War, lol.
Yea, and I'm flying around on my hover board...
Imma be one the dudes in Mars.
I look forward to faster wifi
not the singularity, just no
WHY DONT PEOPLE JUST LISTEN TO THEIR PARENTS AND USE CONDOMS? WE DONT NEED OVERPOPULATION!!
7:13 the astronaut colliding with earth? What world is this!?
Can't say I see the BRIGHT SIDE as being very "bright".
Life sounds creepy after 2030
New type of people are the best

It will not be the teleportation of objects......okay, cool, what will it be then? Also, 2033 will be too late for you to get brain implants? How old are you?
Some of us unfortunately won't be here in 2050.
2:48 I really thought you were going for a very inappropriate joke with that plane.......actually, I think that you half played it like that knowing very well what you almost did lol.
Biological immortality baby
Im looking forward to the year 2035 Because that probobly means you can cure diabetes
The Familia Sacrada is not a cathedral - it's officially named a temple.
You need alot of research for that kind of stuff nice try but alot of things you mentioned are fake & already developed.
Reminds me of all the wrong predictions we heard in the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, 1990s
I am from Denmark, and what he says about we Will open a zoo with no cages and fences is fake. This Channel is based on fake conclusions.
In 2051 fortnite will die
2050 No more Kardashians on TV.
Mind blown. Eye cameras. Yes!!!!!
In the year 2060 there will be flying cars
I bet they forgot to factor in like 2 zombie apocalypses, rise of the machines, 3 Mad Max scenarios and that weird nanobot esque virus that turns organisms into brother eye.
This vid is dope
In 2029 he said astronaut
It's not gonna work. All this tech will fail
goling to mars
Some of these are closer than predicted some are further but these are great predictions 👌🏿🤙🏿
7:12 anyone else catch that he said “astronaut” instead of “asteroid”
4:58 increased reactiontime would not be a benefit I think :P
Those documents were supposed to be released this YEAR
There will be ice age.... Awsome  In 2050 I'll be 50 in june
Ill be 48 in 2050
Solar
No cure for cancer? Wow
The last
6:10 I just care about the 1000 times faster Internet. Playing Call of Duty would be soo much better.    1 Like= 1 Vote for it to happen sooner.
Hmm, i feel like this might be a bit far fetched
Still waiting for that WW3 that will wipe out most of the people. Overpopulating will destroy earth really fast.
I am not on the bright side  After 2050 we all will die
Thanks for burning natural gas with your electric car and putting more stress on the electric grid. And solar panels will never replace natural gas or nuclear power. Don’t believe that
All
Indian gaming community will be awesome  till that time for sure
The apocalypse
My brother can predict the future he predicted the election and other events in perfect detail before it even happened most of this won't happen people wait and see what the real future holds
Google earning money
Omg this makes me want to live forever.
7:11 the probability of the "astronaut colliding with the Earth".
U guys want to know which predicted future event I look forward to? Is that there should be some sort of medication that allows people to stay alive longer. I mean, come on guys. We’re all gonna be too old when we reach 2050.
Nooooo too much tech !No time in our history has needed tech.😯😒😏
Wait what? Quantum teleportation doesn’t mean teleportation in space? What does it mean then? It’s bothering me so hard right now.
The alien invasion in the year 2049 who knows they might be nice
Yeah, Mini Ice Age !!!!
Man I am going to get to leave through 2050 I don’t like that . The cuter looks scary 💎
75% will go vegan and a couple decades later the world population will be reduced by 1/2 due to infertility
Creepy
Bruh this is probably fake
The one when I get laid
What about World war 3?
Add my sc jackm160
You could never ban gas-powered cars here in the US.  Places would literally become unreachable by driving, especially in rural areas.
This is a bunch of bullcrap
At 7:06 he said astronaut
*fake* -fake-
You did not explain the thumbnail picture.
Why only women in thumbnail?
if theres going to be an ice age then we need to get this global warming into action lol
Largely nonsense
You know there *are* other ways to give me nightmares
2027 Google will make the internet 1,000 times faster... Me:YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
I'll be 63 at 2050
Not looking forward to those robots. I’m not even kidding, if they develop any type of human robot I will grow a phobia of those things.
Come on spit it out
Your videos are great but one thing that is bothering me is that you use the unit system of the USA in your videos and that's great but you should put the other unit system that every other country use too (in meters) in your videos so, everybody around the world could understand what mesures you're saying and not just only the americans... Hope you'll understand what I meant and that you're going to put both mesures in your videos next time!
I like how u say people FROM earth that made me laugh
Black Mirror 😐
1980s: We’ll have flying cars in the future!                       2018 - 2050: Political business, including automatic toilet flushers.
7:12 Astronaut?
Are you saying that quantum teleportation won't work
5:43  "thermonukular"
If you're saying the north pole will melt completely then that's bad all life there will extinct unless we do something!!!
Every event!
Norway allow hybrid cars? Because it's electric and gas get it gas because if haven't heard of brain pop they talked about hybrid cars and said that electric vehicles are good but in order get electricity it would be made by coal factories and nuclear power plants and we all know the consequences but I don't think they mention about solar panels they don't hurt the environment and the electricity is made by the sun!
2050
All of them
#24HRVLOGS sub
''Cmon people get a life!''  How could you
Denmark has allready done that
What happen if world will destroyed before 2050 ?

We need the solar energy!
Apopis will kil us on 2036 :  )
Anyone watching this on 2050? Well I am

I’m excited about the asteroid coming close to earth and hopefully hit earth so that we can all die
"Wi-Fi won't exist"    I wish

Someone needs to stop all this population increasing
Charging phones from WiFi? I want that now

These are too positive imagination. I would say more animal species will dissapear,in Europe we will have big problem with muslims,because of their birth rates is much higher than european and they cant integrate at all (what a surprise...) and you cant swim in sees and oceans because its so full of rubbish that it will be too dangerous to our health as well.
Im Glad im only 9 😃😄😄😄😄😃
i am so happy that iam 14
I would like to go on mars
Hey Bright Side, you didn't told about the Energy Crisis on Earth Due to Over Polpulation,
What the hay
I'm fine for everything to happen apart from the destruction of Earth or pollution to get so bad that everything will die. Cross our fingers for nothing terrible to happen!
that 1000 time much speed of Internet
The narrator for Brightside pretty f****** dumb to believe his government had nothing to do with taking out JFK with the war department with a billion dollar budget get a life what kind of a free thinker says something like that to somebody who knows better by evidence gather themselves.
Scientists might be able to blast  asteroids away with a large laser. ( ͡° ʖ̯ ͡°)
Sci Fi seems way scarier when you know it can actually happen
Mars will probably be like the pods in Breathe
Guys, if anyone has seen Lost in Space, you would know to NOT live in space
I NEED SOCCER IN THE FUTURE
longer pines
How does he "know" this all?                                                                                                                                                                                                                           its not like he can predict the future right?
The world exploded in 2012 tho
All but the last one
In the year 2029, the Astroid will come as close as 23,860 miles close to Dusty Depot.
Isn't 3D printing of organs already a thing?

I’ll be 49 turning 50 in 2050

A lot of this sounds like bullcrap.
I’m soooooo exited to live on mars even tho I’ll be like 40
When will Africa develop
Really is this truth?
9:26 yes I need to know who killed my favorite president
7:11 lol astronaut
Can't wait for contact lense cameras
Can't wait to go to Jeddah tower
What will happen to us before 2050?  That's an easy question:  There will be 1 gender. (sarcasm)

Most predictions of the future not only turn out to be wrong, in retrospect they are laughable.
But it is before 2050 it’s 2018
will anything happen to Australia? if so,bad or good? Bad: NOOO NOT MY COUNTRY :(( Good: OoOh! what is it?
Nothing.       I’m tired of these theories
Im so scared
Woah woah woah go back what do you mean a "mini ice age"
Before 2050 people have understood that Hillary would've indeed been a pretty good president.
BRIGHT SIDE I’m from Denmark :-)
HOLD ON A SECOND, you used the instrumental of happy wheels, a jacksepticeye song! I love that song! thats all I had to say
I’m excited for the future but sad cause all my aunts,uncles, grandparents, Mom, and Dad going to be way older :(
7:12 “astronaut” instead of asteroid :P
With the odd natural disasters happening, I don't think we have that much of a future.  And not a lot of people wants to have kids and the world IS getting over populated.
What a lame future awaits those to come. Electric cars and electronic implants pass give me a time machine and send me back to the 70s
I’ll tell u what will happen Jesus is coming back.
Hmm coool
you didint take into account world war 3
8 BILLION PEOPLE

Amen....congrats and ill see you on the bright side of Life ;)

We would’ve had flying cars and other new things by now if it wasn’t for abortion. So many people are murdering there kids nowadays. Thousands of babies are being killed as we speak. Think of all the amazing discoveries we could’ve made by now. Just imagine all the amazing people that have made all the things we use every day. Did you know Steve Jobs’ mom was going to have an abortion, but some amazing people told her they would help her and she could have the baby and then put him up for adoption? I bet you’ve had an apple product before or you’re reading this from one right now. So yes, you wouldn’t have had that right now if things have went otherwise. I mean, murdering your child? I can’t believe how cold hearted people have become. This has been going on for much too long. It needs to stop, like now.
Half-Life 3 will be released.
everyone will be so lazy we dont even need air

Excessive optimism for unlikely outcomes, will make people lazy.  Also a large object missing the earth at all will send the object sling shoting across the universe in a mostly harmless section.
Non

It's nice to here future predictions without hearing about our demise as a species.
we will be 6 feet under. We will ALL be 6 feet under.
In some lands there is already zoos without cages
Pure speculation
Suggesting people should "get a life" if they don't belive Oswald shot Kennedy, earned you a thumb down, dude.
If you dont realize what is wrong with the animation shown at 2:43 then ur not human cuz u didn't know about 911...

Depressing
I look forward to a future we’re every one is Christian and everyone loves each other like siblings because we are all gods children therefore we are all siblings so we should love one another like it and I want to own a decommissioned 1700s frigate and I will modify it to have helicopter propellers and have a zeppelin on top of it and I will fly to space and build a kingdom of ice on the moon and it will be a kingdom without war hate bigotry theft or fear and everyone will be like siblings and it will be a very loving and friendly place the cheers theme or the song ice king sung to Marcy will be our national anthem and it will be friendly to the point were everybody is everybody’s friend and don’t you want to go somewhere we’re everybody knows your name and we will have no taxes everyone will have equal rights and freedom and I will be king but ultimately it is gods kingdom he will guide me and teach me to be a good king and we will always be loving and happy to one another as a family through prosperity and poverty we will stick together as gods family   Like if you support

I’m not excited for any of this because it sounds scary
I doubt all of the stuff over 2030 is is real.
10:41 *Clears throat*     *Whispers creepily*  Detroit Become Human...
i hope in the future we dont become lazy!!! i mean i wouldnt want people or robots to do things for me!

Unless there is a world war
Only Allah (SWT) knows what will happen in future
Only Allah (SWT) knows what will happen in future
You know if you look at the predictions about the future, aka, the 21st century, by people living in the 1900s or 1950s, you will realize how naive and almost ridiculous they were back then. And now we are predicting the future? If you keep this record till 2050, people then will laugh their heads off looking at your predictions, just like what we now think about the people in the 1900s or 1950s. The problem with science-people is they don’t really learn history, so they don’t learn from history. And same things happen over and over again.
you forgot 2022 the time we could vote for president

Some of this “might” happen it can sometimes be true and not be true it just makes me scared of the future.
I hope my family will still be alive..
No more YouTube
9 billion people? We need a new plague
My kids are lucky.            (I don't have children yet I'm only ten and I'm not married )
I would be 44 years old in 2050!
oml are we gonna die from that meteor
so will the world end in 2029?!?!?
Around 2045 or a lil lower there’s 9 billion people. Soon the earth is gonna full so much that they need to get rid of it.
I came here hoping to hear that androids would exist. (Ahem.. Connor)

2049

"Teen titans go!" Will be wiped off the face of TV forever! All the people in north Korea will be free! And Trump will be long dead!

2020: 2020 vision jokes
In 2030 you could have said that the centenary world cup will happen, thats beacuse the first world cup was in 1930 :D
I'm scared of the astroid
Rule number 1: Never trust anything the internet says 4+ years int the future
.....apparently America goes through food the size of rhode island everyday, and for our current population, we need about 2 and a half earths to sustain ourselves. If it reaches 9 billion people, won't we run out of food? And if we were to depend on GMO food as our main source of food, wouldn't there be more diseases? And American debt is over $19 billion now, so with it escalating, how would we advance and achieve all this by 2050? Resources are also looking pretty scarce and we aren't certain of the dangers of Mars' atmosphere or about it's own resources. I don't want to be anti-optimism, but I don't know how we could focus on advancement with all the problems with scarcity we have (hopefully we can get past this but I don't know).
thats not fairyou history punk the old people dont get to live today 2047
i have t
I was thinking that the ice is melting
When I saw th3 thumbnail I was like why are there two female bathroom signs *gasps* is everyone turning female

Where is ww3?
No they shouldn't build another tall tower, they might be terrorist that want to repeat history
the mars colernisen
how come no one says anything about world war 3? it is obvious that it will happen pretty soon, as you can see even today the weather becomes extremely unstable, it will lead to food shortages, and eventually war over food and water
I don't go to Starbucks...
The one were u can charge stuff by Wifi
maybe we’ll all be girls , ooo the making babys ;)
The teleportation

future is ww3
7:11 astronaut colliding with the earth
Will we be dead 💀 from the miteur

We will have Android's that bring a peaceful approach but humanity kills them anyway but in the end the Androids win
Yeah.. Nothing will happen XD🤣😂😆🤣😅

I'mma die before most of this...
I meant I live in Dubai
Ok and I love in Dubai 😉
I'll be in my 60's by 2050 cause I am 10 years old right now
They use Scare Tactics like saying an asteroid is going to hit Earth when it cannot God made this land he's the only one that can destroy it
They're going to use all of these things to take away not to give if we don't do something now our children will be lost
ill still be alive!! i would be around 40 something years!!
I'll be surprised to see just one of those predicted things come true when predicted. The Fusion Reactor under consideration is for experimental use and isn't guaranteed to even be self-sustaining much less generate power, it won't be connected to the grid. As for the rest, add a couple-few decades less the tall building, but I seriously doubt even it will be completed on time and certainly not on budget.
Nothing will happen  chill x
I live in Denmark
I am 9 so I will be alive probably
Android will take over the world by then  *cough Detroit cough*
Who else went straight to the comments 😂
No! I live in norway and i turn eighteen in 2025 and want a evor or a mx5 4:30
My favorite is humans colonizing Mars so there won't be plenty of people on earth anymore geez
All these forecars are too cute and optimistic.
Im excited about the mini ice age because I didn't expect another ice age because global warming is happening people that's why im excited!
1000 x faster internet here i come
i hope we all die
Numbers are all off
Im scared of the astroid hitting earth but its only 2.7% god protect us!
I dont want to dead when Moon And sun were desapierd
The future looks great! But I have a feeling you only looked at the BRIGHT SIDE. :-)
im starting to feel scared about what will happen in the future
im scared of space god pls dont let asteroid hit earth and dont make that its important to go to mars im so scared of space D:
Jesus Christ the Son of God died on the cross for all the sins you've ever committed and if you believe and put your trust in Him you will live forever in heaven.
can i just point out that the earth has now REACHED 8 bil i think this IS NOT CORRECT!
Bionic Eyes, I want 2 change my eye color badly
INTERNET ONE CUZ IT= TO MORE FORTNITE

I think that the creationist that the god make them that we call it an aliens will came in the earth soon as the god tell them to come into the earth or them come to planet with out a order for the God, it be will very scary if them attracted us but it will be not because they will be very intelligence and tall, big and beautiful as they will change the believe of our world and help as to grown planet with love world and end war and end of the fake religious, it will be nice to have help from another creationist😔😔😔😏
The population predictions are always too high. They never take into account that places that are developed usually have people who don't want children or only want one of two
End of call of duty 2020
Excuse me, and ASTRONAUT is gonna crash into the earth?! DEAR GOD!!
I don,t wanna futuristic world i will never trust a machine machines like if you agree even now i,m using one even though it can betray me any moment now

Faster wifi
2018 YAS!! 9035 NOOOO

WW3 will probably happen by then
In Winter 2020, Sir Sandford Fleming Elementary School Will Be Complete In Vancouver,BC,Canada. We Had A Old School Now. The Building Will Be Complete After 2 Years!

Death
DUDE I REMEMBER THE TIME WHEN THIS VIDEO WAS TRENING THAT THIS GUY that comes from thw future SAID IN YEAR 2035 a teleportation was gonna be realised
Can all this really happen in just 22 years?
Wait aroura the ship from subnautica
Most of this sounds great, except for the tech being implanted into your body segment, I understand if it's a need for replacing damaged body parts essential for a normal life, but besides that there's risks, such as side effects, glitches, maintenance, costs, and hackability.
I really hate this channel
“Aurora”? You mean the big ship from Subnautica?
By 2050 we'll all be chicks!
2050? Why 2050? Is the world gonna end?
Il be 61 wen year 2050
At 2050 I will be 45 years old duckers. Yes DUCKERS
If we get so tech then let's do a teleportation or hyper sleep or something in a rocket and move to another planet like NASA wants to do. Because they said they might of found a planet in the Goldie lox zone. Yay let's meet more of us
Are you God to know what will happen    or somehow your superpower is future reading
There's already 1 in Canada but you drive thru it
Yay! I'll only be 44 years old when mars colonisation starts I'll be old enough to go there and young enouhh to stay (I think I said colonisation wrong)
Robots Lazer eyes and we will be spiderman
I would love to charge my phone with Wi-Fi so don't have to plug it in
This is both amazing and terrifying especially since it could happen during our lifetime
I don't like how the future looks 😐 why can't we just have live like how we are in the 2018
So optimistic
I have a bad feeling about the colonization of mars
What will happen before 2050           I will loose my will to live
THE FUTER REALLY SCARES ME!! :'(
Mars colonization
fun to see how we will keep investing in increasing life time instead of stabilizing our world. Dont get me wrong, its good to keep people heathy, but it is already hard to handle the population we have now, and increasing life time will only make things worst.
Jesus HELP ME!!!!!! I am scared
At 7:02 he says astronaut not asteroid  funny
i had cancer but the cure i was given was malaria but i didnt get malaria cancer has a cure
Aren’t we supposed to go to mars in 2020?

The probability of the "astronaut!?" colliding with the Earth in 2029 was only 2.7%! LOL oopsie around the 7:15/7:16 mark!  We're only human..of flesh and blood we're made.. we're only human..born to makes! - The Human League ;-)
Here is a guy who can tell the future because he lives in the future
Wait, so there will be actual androids? What if Detroit: Become Human actually happens?
Ok why declassify JFK's assassination in 2038? Just do it now
my age like if laugh / giggle
We all know that we’re not gonna live till 2050
Every planet in the galaxy will finally live in peace when humans go extinct
1 bet we wouldbe on a different planet.

Cool tech but don't human beings have enough futer toys for a while
I'm looking forward to all of it.

Also, you already know we’re in an ice age right?
Yup an astronaut will collide with earth
Nun 😟😟😟😟😟😟😟😵😵😵
Singillaraty is a movie I seen with arora and kronos with v tech
Too scared. I am too young , and I realise that humanity will end soon. :( I wish we could stop the time with future technology. ;(
8 billion? there are already too many people on Earth.
I don’t like to think about all this and possibly the extinction of life. It scares me.
6.1 billion people will not have phones.  People will not be sending things to mars There will not be a space hotel People will not be on mars any time soon.  People will not charge phones on WiFi  Venice will not be uninhabitable. Flood defences will be put in place A man mission to mars will not start. Maybe a humanoid robot but not a man Probes will not go to the alpha centori star system The mars one project will probably happen but not any ‘colonisation’
Why the eye implant? Are eyes are already 10, 000 times better than an iPhone 8 camera.
I guess ur a time traveler.
Mars colonisation

What will happen before 2050 i know            We will lose Youtube!
The fact I am 12 and I am going to be able to see all of it!!!

I always thought when I was younger that in 2012 we would be living the life like the jetsons robot maids living in the sky driving cars that fly and bikes that hover and fly but nooope also thought our houses would do our work for us like imagine not walking and being moved to the bathroom have our teeth brushed shower dressed by machine then for working out the treadmill floats as well and electronics everywhere the only thing we need to do is sit and sip coffee and put our finger to our brain and say ok Google and a screen will pop up in our face like a  hologram and tell it what to do 😲😖
What if these don’t actually occur?
And also in 2020 there will be Uber air!
2050 human race is the biggest joke in multiverse.
I am a bit scared for the future..

Yes i cant wait for the future !!!
Mars
I can’t believe that you said “ come on people, get a life” about the full disclosure of the JFK killing. He was our president and anyone with half of a brain knows that Lee Harvey Oswald was a puppet or just one of many government hitmen who killed the president who was going to take back all of the power from the corrupt bankers that rule our country.
We pray ro survive the meteor in 2029

7:08 i dont wanna wait can that hurt you or not 😔😞☹️
If you like World War 3 will happen
They'll change  *D O N E*
My question is WILL BRIGHT SIDE REACH 20 MIL
I don't want all of these changes for Earth to happen so soon, except for curing deaf people, because in my opinion, that's what matters
I like my life and this is kinda scaring me with how much it is going to change
Charging your phone with the internet
AI could become our friends and they could be use a soilders
All of them because I will only be 47 in 2050
My dad walks in on the Russia part  “Are you watching teleportation?”   Me: “no dad this is science channle that is really smart and can predict the future.”  DAd: “OkAy!” “Pssssshhh teleportation yeah right.”  Me: “oh dad bright side will make you see, TELEPORTATION WILL COME!
7:10-7:13 The Astronaut will collide with earthhhhhhh
And oh no I'm scared for 2029 cause that meteor is kinda scary I'll be on the moon by 2029
Cool video about what will happen before 2050 here's a thing I know that will happen in 2020 the Japanese or Chinese will finish solar panels there putting on the moon
What abt super valcano in yellow stone
Am I the only one who's thinking about how old I'll be when 2050 rolls around throughout the whole video
It seems like they're going to make it so everything that we have 2 work 4 now we'll be able 2 do it in 2 seconds
Aurora? Like the one from subnautica? Will that happen? I wonder
How does BrightSide know about the future?
WHERE R THE JET PACKS!!!!!!!!!!!
And I will be the first to Starbucks 😂😂
2020 is the real year my step dad gets maried to my mum

10:20 If deafness is cured and AC/DC's long time singer is still alive,I look forward to if they cure the ear issue that caused him to stop rocking and that he can return to AC/DC.Assuming they still exist.

Contacts with cameras already exist and 3D printers are already being used to make new organs.
2033

1000 comment
Let’s go back to 2011 ⚡️
Yay 1000th comment
In 2050 we all died
well we really dont have the power or knowledge to completely understand what is going to happen in a couple months, days, hours, and even years especially. and yes they can lay out plans but they cant necessarily predict the future nor tell us or try to influence us about it because in all reality are brains are wired to think a certain way and to complete different take differently and to think as others wouldn't its just simple reasoning nobody can predict the future on earth because were not made too and if your really influenced by this and scared then you shouldn't be we were made to live and reproduce if its our time to go then so be it no matter what your beliefs our and i dont know much but im telling you its nothing to stress about just live as you are right now or better simple! ; ) yes we are the downfall of earth but yet in the same hand the earth goes through changes we cant stop or chance no matter how hard we try we may just be the reason but y be the reason if there is none???
I don't believe were going to mars in 2050 and if we are, I'm not going.
2026 I’m young at that age probably 20 years old and It said INTERNET WILL GET 1’000 FASTER WOOOO
I hope Chris Evans doesn't die. Because i don't WANT ANOTHER CAPTAIN AMERICA
All

None so I haven't looked for one of these predictions by you but I had a feeling some or a little of this won't happen.
"No not that kind of organs you silly " he got me laughing on the floor 😂😂😂😂😂😂
2049 will happen '_'
And everyone will rely on robots and become lazy
Becoz if robots start ruling uss
Robots should not be common
I'll be 58. if I'm still around
This is the bright side the reality is globalisation slavery a cashless society and a lifetime of introverted paranoid loneliness in a virtual computer run would
Oh my, look at this world now because it will never be the same again.
*I hope I don't live at the year 2100....it's weird and life would be boring*
"The probability that the astronaut...."
This is horrifying
*yeah I’m okay with “hurrah! Healthy earth” but I want to keep aspects of the past. Like uhh.. Less “Fresh Produce” in Supermarkets. Grow your own the hanging gardens of your house. But if it’s winter or you want to eat tropical fruit it will still be in the stores*
This is creepy
Congrats on 10 million subs
Like if you agree with god and ya
God is the only one that knows what will happen
i don't like any. why can't the world stay how it is?
I hope No game no life season 2 will come up

Hey I got new reason to live
On 2050 I will be my age my dad is now And on 2050 my dad will be 82 maybe if not I’m mistaken
I look forward to more overpopulation, resource scarcity and danker memes.
I want to go to space for my vacation but also i'm not that wealthy it'll be costing in arab and kharabs(that's the indian numeric system)
In the year 2050 ......bright side will reach 1billion subs...... And will be announced as the most clickbaiter YouTube channel
I wonder what kind of video games we have at that time😁😁
And, how do you know that all of this is true?
WHO WISHES THAT HE COULD BE THE FIRST ONE TO GO TO THE MARS TO LIVE I KNOW IT'S SILLY BUT I WOULD LOVE IT BUT I HATE THE TRAVELLING TIME AND ONE MORE QUESTION WILL I BE ABLE TO RUN YOUTUBE THERE LOL
Well this is for sure, in 2050, while my brither will be having a mid life crisis, it will be a reminder to watch this video again.
I ONLY BELIEVE 2% BECAUSE SOME OF THAT STUFF IS BELIEVABLE. THE REST OF THE STUFF I DONT BELIEVE BECAUSE YOU GUYS ARE TRYING TO MAKE A CHEAP BUCK OUT OF KIDS!!!!! These kids will probably be scared till 2050 when NONE OF THIS HAPPENED, except for some stuff, but STILL, STOP
4:38-4:48 I am gonna die!
How do you know
This was only the good ones without the country that are drowing... R.I.P 2100, but we just know,s the good ones for now. In the furtsure we all gonna beg to get help.... BYE GOOD/Sweat World as we know i. 2018.
Yeay finally Norway do something good for the world with cars :D
Yay I can’t wait to be a robot!!
i don't want i wanna stay in normal earth
Will there be YouTube or not? Only that matters to me 😂😂😂
Internet speed
I hate this voice
One day AI WILL rule the earth and we humans will be their servant/ assistant !!!!!! That is for sure
lol hahahahahah D . . * . . . . . :8:
In this video, it says the future will get more and more high-tech but our earth will get older and sad about what humans do, it was sad😥
9+ billion...we better start to be more kind to each other right now people :D
Already the ppl who control the world are the computer geeks. They can manipulate in unimagineable ways.  I doubt the majority of the 9 billion ppl will have food or shelter. Most work will be done by robots that are owned by a small group of ultra wealthy families. The economies will not be able to sustain 8-9 billion. I hope they don't stop loving acoustic music.
I was expecting "Islam will rule Europe" kind of thing lol. If AI and tech does everything we can do, we wont have any jobs. The government might even start giving rations so we can enjoy life, while the robots toil, which they wont mind as they wont tire out, so basically we are approaching the world of Wall-E.
2049
Thanks for information. Its too good. I got 5% of knowledge from this video
No alien contact 😞
In 2050, I wanna watch this video again to see how accurate it was

I'm looking forward to the mini ice age if it means I won't melt down here in the summer 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
They said the future would be hovering and marble in 1890 and then here we are in 2018 and everything is almost the same :/
This is scary
Is this true
Scary how by 2050 we will be 33 years older. And 33 years closer to the day we will die. :(

The future scares me a lot but at the same time fascinates me a bit
The cool eyes he was talking about
how can anybody predict the future
2049 is before 2050
I had hoped that the world would be very clean and holds lots of flora within it. Instead, people will fall lazy and unwise. Hopefully, we can change the future by working together.    *Now, I see how old people feel....*
None will happend
No to all of it🤯
7:10 "probability of Astranaut colliding with the Earth"...

At 7:11, "The probability of the *astronaut* colliding with Earth in 2029 was only about 2.7%."
When you say "you see a dark person in your future" you mean black. As there will be no majority white countries in the world😧
My theory me=💰💰💵💴💶💷💸💰

But will come up in public in 2028 and yeah,  Mr President Trump will be meeting aliens very soon in upcoming years and for more information you can subscribe to apex TV and paranormal elite
I am interested about the human population and the year 2050 I would 45 by then anyway keep it up

7:12 he said astronaut not asteroid
And then we will all die :D !
A zoo with no walls .. did no one paid attention to jurassic park lol
I urge you not to use teleportation if you’re alive for it. It essentially kills you and puts a clone of you out there.
NO NOT AN ICE AGE NOT AGAIN *flashbacks of the movie Ice Age*
It wasn’t a Thermo nuclear reactor, it was a nuclear fusion reactor. They’re different
He said astronaut
Only one part of the Bible tells u what is going to happen
I'll be 30 yrs old in that timeline..
Is the asteroid coming in uae
Omg this video made me cry! Why are you predicting my life? I’m having a panic attack!
I look to see the emplants in your head and in your hand this has been on the minds of ppl for thousands of years and I'll not be taking it if possible 😀
Oh no russia is going to be namba wan agian
With all of the drugs the pharmaceutical companies make to get people addicted, I doubt overcrowding will ever be an issue.
2045 is when WWIII will start
I'm scared 😳 this people how know this
Some of it is good for us and some of it is not but  it was a good video
Cool so we are trying to stop pollution in 2025

Im scared i dont whant to Not happend cause IM SCARED OF ROBOT BUT THE 2020-2030 ARE Cool!
I'm scared of the future... Who else is scared of it...?

Dont need to watch the video the answer is 2049
Smashing it with Robots is cool. 😂

OMG😱 I just had a dream about that I long time ago 😨😨😰😰🤭🤭😱🤗😱😱😱
I would be 48 before 2050 lol
Solar energy will never become more economical than other forms of energy in a free market economy.
What are we talking about 2050' s? Maybe God is going to come earlier
I’ll look forward to wireless charging a game changer for all smartphones
Honestly i would use implants for my eyes and Brain, would be effective in many ways that’s for sure
Colonisation then I'll be a Martian
magnitude path weak display explore museum Asian if ground secret anybody security far.
I don't believe that at all and no one should
companies should already develope and mass produce robots at this point , they will look really dumb in 15-25 years otherwhise  theres a whole generation of people who are getting old right now ( like my mothers generation (she currently is 54 ) she has 3 siblings and also 2 cousins , all more or less the same age except the youngest uncle who is 41   there will be a huge demand for more people for ambulances , nurses , and other emergency things , and whats better than having an infinite supply of robots ? hospitals already have a near infinite supply of blood pressure monitors , and other machines , robots will be needed for sure  so , why wait 10-30 more years  before starting to produce them   also , theres tons of young women who study and priotize jobs over having children at young age , so there will be less children that could do these jobs aswell  and lastly , what about normal people ? i know i would instantly buy a robot servant , especially if it had artificial intelligence and i could talk with it about all sorts of things like manga , anime etc
A world without religion. Come on!
623th
I'm scared 😨
I will be 70 by the time the year 2050 comes. But it is still interesting by all the things that is going to happen. Most especially all the astronomy related ones. I do have a huge passion for astronomy. I also really love hearing about India. Which is the only country that I have such a huge massive love for.
I want to go to mars with my future family.
the idea of implants to 'cure' neurological conditions as a sufferer of ms it can't​ come soon enough
I will see my crush in Berlin in the future☺️
And then they will tell us that god sent them a sign😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Eyyyy im from norway
2038 no they already released documents on JFK showing the CIA did it and it's only 2018
Omg in comm there was 666

Great, there's a 2.7% chance I will die in my 20s
Artificial bbc will be available for all robots.
2025 will be the best. Battre with wify
When will DarkOlandia be a new country ?
Well by 2050 I’ll be 53
Nothing about Cryptocurrency?
They forgot to mention that by 2050 all the worlds rainforests will be more or less destroyed and thousands of species will go extinct each year because of humans, right now 137 go extinct EVERY DAY we NEED to do something about this or it will get worse and worse...
World currency? Btc? Cars? Flying cars?
I’m waiting for the day when you get injection in your arm and hour later you’ve got full access to the Internet
The best one will be charging a phone through wifi. Hi else agrees. Just 7 years apparently still too long
Yo when's my immerssive full dive virtual reality available. I told my friend I would play games with him when it comes out
in year 2050 BRIGHT SIDE will reveal their face
in year 2050 minecraft and mario bros. will be the best graphics game
What means quantum teleportation?
He just said 'AURORA'. This is the name of the spacecraft that crash lands in the game 'subnauctica'. Strange.
I don’t like the brain implant idea
We will all be dead I bet:/
I'm okay with all of these EXCEPT for asteroid almost hiting the Earth!😥 (Sorry for bad English)
I will lose my virginity before 2050 :D
Maldives will sink
Oviously Mars colonisation
I don't know about the implants you'll make inside your brain. See, technology is good when it's used in proper ways, however, there will always be that one person or one group of people, ready to mess things up. It's human nature.
I hope the 3. World war won't start
Soooo all of this and STILL no cure for Cancer? Colonizing Mars? Really? How about we try to effectively help people and animals on EARTH first.
*Good*
Looks great. 2050 here we come, US citizens will come to mars first.
NOW SO THE YEAR 3000!!! IM SO INTERESTED!!!
An meteor?!?!!!! Please God help us 😱🙇
I hope nothing happens anytime.

I actually like Denmarks plan with animals roaming free! :)
Hello. Well that was highly interesting !! Hopefully I will be still alive to see all this sh*t happening. How do you know all this stuff ?  I bet you guys will be interested to find out if these predictions comes true huh. Hard to say which one was the craziest but one this I know....I will not be in the Starbucks line ! Thanks 👍😀
🇪🇺🇪🇺🇪🇺🇪🇺🇪🇺🇪🇺🇪🇺🇪🇺👍🏻
This is so cool. I Wish i were born in the 2050. But we have to use this time in the 2018 bcs we Will never experience this again. Unless time traveling fixes everything so the human can live in the year 0 with the futures technology so the global warming takes longer time. And then we can continue that every 1000 year
I know the narrator wasn’t even born 1963,  but if you think Lee Harvey Oswald was the assassin of JFK, you have to explain why the first place he was seen 90 seconds after the last shot was fired, was in the 2nd floor break room of the Texas School Book Depository, drinking a Coke by a Dallas Policeman.   Oswald had supposedly fired his shots from the 6th floor,  then ran down unobserved by anyone to the 2nd floor he was first seen in those 90 seconds.   The FBI attempted to prove this was possible by having an athlete do it (No One Claims Oswald was any kind of  Runner).   The athlete was able to do it running as fast as he was able,  but he could not get a Coke out of the soft drink machine in the required time.   The Warren Commission simply deleted the Coke Oswald was drinking from its published report.    Anyone who has looked at the mountains of contradictions and omissions in the Warren Report knows this was a successful Coup.  Not the action of a lone crazed gunman.
Woaah:<
At Feb.1.2019 an asteroid 1km may hit earth
THIS IS A COPY. REAL LIFE LORE POSTED THIS VIDEO AGES AGO

Hoe oud is deze gast
I listen this guy sound everywhere
In the year 2028 scientist will release time travel to public :D
Is anyone scared about the future?
@bright side, what if I tell you that Jesus is coming back before that :p
They copied this from real life lore
Mini ice age
I hate to say it but we need to do something about the human population I am not saying a cull but we need to do something
I don't like anything
🤔

I loved it bright side give me more😜🤪😘😘😘
Do u get Diamond Play Button
I’m old enough to have heard Edward Teller say in 1965 that we would have On Line Fusion Reactors by 1975.  What happened?
Hallow
Noting will happen, till 2050 we still fighting with Islamic fundamentalist & ISISI... it might be possibility we will see all over the world woman in Veil.. 😅😅😅
!WOW!  I would prefer the past with no technology than the future with all those inventions😢
Humans are getting so smart they can basically make the world do what ever they want it’s kinda scary what they can do with they’re power
Me.. I want that 1000x faster internet.. HEY GOOGLE! better get working on that project XD
year 2050 ? syempre di pa din asensado ang mga pinoy dahil sa kawalang disiplina at corruption, mas dadami ang adik pag dilawan ang nasa pwesto.. mas dadami pa ang tangang millenials na lulong sa social media at di marunong mag Google Search at gagawin nila ang pagtatanong sa FB Groups at hindi sila aware na may google search
WAIT WHAT IN 2029 IS THE END OF WORLD NOOO!! ;(
Were gooiiinggg to die there gion be to many humans so more and more trees will die i think we will make it to 3040 but a cue 4 cancer i hope i fell bad 4 people with cancer
YAY Self driving card
9233rd......yay
I think some of your predictions are off by a decade or more - not more years but fewer. And in 2064 I'll be 100.
I'm looking foward to the enhancments, like from bioshock
Hey
Aurora?like real life subnautica
I'll be 74 years old in 2050
Rip you future....🙎🙎
If I live at least 98 years that will mean I’m going to die in 2103.. I wonder if all of us are going to be extinct way before then because of the loss of plants which provide oxygen and... ok don’t worry about that now?
Well...easy enough, most of Humanity will be dead, and the ones who survive will be slaves or humanoids...!
Bright Side lol I see what you're trying to do at 2:44
not unless we don't annihilate​ each other
Hong Kong will be ruled by china
The only way to realize that there’s only one thing that could tell us what’s going to happen....        Spider-Man dies in infinity war
I can see the future that captain marvel with company will defeat thanos
Elephants, tigers, bears, alligators, crocs, and gorrilas etc... at a zoo without cages... Ok.. Lets see how that one plays out.
I'll take the control of the world and turn the Earth to green again. Nothing of these will happen. You're poor prediction. I'm a wizard or even more than that...
World war lll is a possibility
How do u know all tid
cool
L'espace est beau er pourtant si terrifiant.
do you know what happens tomorrow?
Can't wait for the technological singularity.  I hope I'm around to see it.
Elon musks mars colonisation
So basically...in 2045...everyone will turn into GLaDOS?
I'm scared dude!! the technologies are overruling 😱
7:12 Did he just say astronaut?
Earth will be taken over by mole people
I'm excited to charge our cell phones with wifi!!!
Yeah i don't believe. I remember the predictions for 2017, complete BS!
No! Androids will be born and they will defeat Gohan & destroy the Earth!!
This is so boring
Imma be 51 when this all happens before 2051

Man this all is bs
1st of all .. Grt video by u.. you mentioned about many things going to happen year by year grt work done by bright side.. happy for that .. looking forward to see many such videos.. I always try to figure out the possibilities going to happen  in future based on the past n current events n patterns. Ur video questioned my intuitiveness lot.. have to cross check some nw..😉 grt work guys.. 👏👏
Some of these things such as teleportation,3D printing organs and artificial blood are already being used.
Ooo next year
How life expectancy will increase. I don't get this thing.
I would look forward to the year 2050 even though I was born in 1987, hey, Should've been born in 1997 instead so I could probably live the year 2050
This video has 6297 view in a hour, wow!
In 2025 onwards India will overtake France and Uk in terms of GDP!
Space travel will be commonplace 😁
You didn't mention the year of world war 3, so I'm expecting it would never happen
This video was posted 2018
Will this be like the movie "THE GIVER"?
And in 2050 i will be 50
Plzzzzzzz make a video on india
I hope time travel will be available in my lifetime.

That was nice. Thanks. ☺😍😚😎🙌
Is that a good thing or a bad thing? 6:55?
Plz don't show how all things will ruined be on bright side 😃😃😃😃😂😂😂

Scared for others but, I will be dead. Thanks for the video.
at 7:15 he called the asteroid an astronaut
Okay lest see
Umm the tallest tower is the Ex seed 6000 tower where 10000 people
God has already told us what will happen...and soon!!  The warfare against God’s law, which was begun in heaven, will be continued until the end of time. Every person will be tested. Obedience or disobedience is the question to be decided by the whole world. All will be called to choose between the law of God and the laws of men. Here the dividing line will be drawn. There will be but two classes. Every character will be fully developed; and all will show whether they have chosen the side of loyalty or that of rebellion.  Watch "The Truth About The Mark Of The Beast" on YouTube https://youtu.be/gV82VcSxLvA
World war 3 is not that far away
How do you know this is true?

Hi!!!!!!!!
Yo i was scared reading the title

It all a lie
Jeff Bezos is the President of the United Planets and immortality is now included with Amazon Prime.

Cell phone implants

Where is WORLD WAR 3?
And God Laughed😂😂😂
What kind of changes are expected to shake the education system in next 30 years?
is asteroid really coming in 23860 miles?
Humans will destroy the earth. AI will advance and hopefully take us out and save our planet lol 🤔😂
I'm really not looking forward to any of this. The future is very scary and still unpredictable. Mike ADHD is right, humans are ruining earth. Enough is enough. There is a reason why I prefer technology that only goes as far as transportation, like trains and boats and ships.
2029 I Dont Want It I Dont Want To Die Pls Dont Do This Its Make Worried To Myself
Why would anyone want this. Technology is destroying our way of life as it is, why make it worse?
Hello!

Hi
