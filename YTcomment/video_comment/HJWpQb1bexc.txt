❤
All of them !;I Hope your family  are doing well!!!❤ ❤❤
I tried this again 2 years later from my other post and I don't know what went wrong followed everything to the T what went wrong ? I made the base put it in refridgerator when I tasted it I could taste the chia seeds nope I didn't like it . I made sure I stirred it went
Hola the one that you mixed the banana and strawberry after you put in fridgerator then you topped it with mor banana and strawberry ?
What if i use the normal milk?
Ma i semi di kia fanno aria al colon?
I use Thai Kitchen brand Coconut milk and use the thick cream on top with the milk and bled it together.  Then put  ingredients into each ball one cup canning jars, put the lid on and shake.  It’s very thick like pudding and delicious!
Can’t wait to try them all!
Thank you so much for this healthy delicious recipes on chia seeds. I am going to make these tonight and have one for breakfast. 👍💯
I love the chocolate one
Thank you very much for the recipe.  I just made the chocolate chia pudding and it's in the fridge now. It's going to be very delicious for sure.  I added a bit of vanilla essence too. Can't wait to try it tomorrow. ❤
NPI will try them all  strawberry banana is my favorite that matcha one looks delicious thank you
I like it better with 3 tablespoons per half a cup of milk. It's firm, more like rice pudding. I also add a bit of vanilla. And plain white sugar, why not.
Chocolate all the way!!
For the chocolate one, have you tried putting in a teaspoon of vanilla? I just read a recipe in the back of the Chia C bag, and it said a teaspoon of vanilla.
Chocolate
too much sugar not healthy at all
Look so delicious
Team chocolate!
I've been making a peanut butter and banana on repeat. But the next batch I'm going to make peanut butter and chocolate :)
I use protein shakes instead of milk. they are really good, & thick, so I only use 1 1/2 Tablespoons of chia seeds & the thickness is like regular pudding. so yummy.
Your the only one that does this correctly I love your videos you explain things very well and at a good pace 👏 Thank you for the Amazing chia seed video makes so awesome!!🤗✌️🫶🙌🙏
Can you have chia pudding warm like a porridge??
I have tried this recipe and love the unique way you cooked! The information and instructions you provided in this video on making chia pudding were so easy to follow. I really appreciate your creativity in presenting healthy breakfast ideas.  I recently made this recipe with True Elements chia seeds, and it turned out amazing. Chia seeds added a wonderful texture and nutritional boost to the pudding. Thank you for sharing these four delicious ways to enjoy chia pudding as a healthy breakfast idea!
Love this is plant-based as I have a family history of Cancer so need to avoid the estrogen and BLV in dairy. Thanks so much for sharing
My chia pudding never gets thick. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong.
I do something similar, but i use chia seed, greek yogurt plain, and any flavor protein powder as my base 😊
Just get to the point stop rambling so much.
As always, my fav is chocolate😊
im gonna try them.all accept the matcha
Hello! What is the topping next to the berries on the chocolate pudding?
I wonder about using chocolate protein powder instead of chocolate powder? I have some I got to use up
Chocolate sounds like the winner to me…we shall soon see!
I will make the chocolate first.
All 4 look yummy.
The chocolate
I always add about a tablespoon or so of unflavored collagen powder, which is good to boost your collagen intake.
Yamiiiiiiiiiiii! 😋
your tablespoons must be huge in america. that looks like 4 british tablespoons.
I have a big bag of Cacao powder that is dying to be used in one of these…I think I will try BOTH ways, with almond milk AND coconut milk!
The milk: https://youtu.be/lblOc6zjYP8?si=vFzshiocb7STJbIo
I did not know this could be made with coconut milk.   i've been unnecessarily going to the store and buying regular milk just to make this.  Thank you for these recipes!  i've already made the chocolate one and love it. I am planning to do the other's very soon.
You didn't put the apples and walnuts in with the raisins why?
Can you make it with Chocolate powder protein? Instead of cocoa powder .
Hi Danny, love the recipes🙏😋 I am personally eating chia seeds in smoothie. I wonder if these recipes are suitable for kids age 10&15years. Also is chia seeds suitable for person with gout?? Are there any exception that a person shud not take chia seeds? Thanx!!
Hi friend, these chia puddings are delicious. You did a great job, thanks for sharing!
I will be trying the first one!  As someone who struggles with implementating all the nutrients necessary for my body while pleasing my palette, thank you🙂
Can you mix milk and coconut milk for this pudding.
Would like a pck of matcha tea, please
May be I'll try the green chia pudding with spinach. Hope it works...
I love Matcha & the color, might add a little honey ( matcha can be bitter)
Matcha is NOT meant to soothe or relax, it is the highest amount of caffeine you can be having amongst green teas, since you are consuming the actual tea leaf.   Great video, nonetheless 😊
They all look so good. I would like the chocolate  or any of the others!
Chocolate!
My husband and i werent eating clean and healthy before a few days ago and this just makes me excited to try different desert options or breakfast options. He has been diagnosed with diabetes and this is a great start to a different life style.
Do you grind up the seeds in a coffee grinder before you make pudding?
Thank you so much Danni, I really really enjoyed watching you show us all about these great chia pudding’s.  I like the sound of all of them. Please stay safe and well too xxx Mags ❤❤❤❤
Ca aurait ete bien de mettre des sous-titres en francais.!!
Chocolate
If you haven't heard of the wonderful powers of chia seed or just want a refresher of how good they are for you,  just watched the power of seeds for neuropathy you tube, so good
These look so freaking amazing, imma try macha and chai first
Chocolate is my favorite but I love the macha idea!
I think matcha is great-one recipe for a drink I make all the time. All you have to do is mix matcha powder with water and sweetener, then mix that matcha liquid in water and plant milk. Delicious!
Good thing it’s not “dirty” chia pudding
Why use of the word Chai?? Chai is a hindi word for milky brown tea. U hv only added cinnamon powder, that doesn't constitute to chai ...
Can’t go the texture of slime of the chia seeds..any substitutes out there?
Excellent 😀 I  never knew about this pudding till recently! I'm going to do them asap 👏💟 it all looked great !
Love it. Have it for breakfast nearly every day now. Have it with blueberries, raspberries, mixed sunflower and pumpkin seeds, vainilla and little cinnamon. Thank you for the recipe suggestions. 💖
From where you get this jar ?
I will try and make the chocolate 🍫 chia pudding and strawberry 🍓 and banana.
I like them all will make them soon thank you 😊
Everytime I hear the word 'chia' I think of the 'Chia Pet' commercials and the little jingle:  "Ch-ch--cha-CHI-a!"
Yumi 😊
I am going to make the chocolate and chia first. Yummm. Easy.
Hi.Thank you very much for your recipes,ideas,your great presentation and the motivation 👏 👍 to eat chia.
Thank You for sharing, my 12 year-old Son and I just made these🤗
Just a note of caution. 1 tbsp of cocoa powder was way too strong for me and I felt like I needed more sweetener to make it palatable. If you’re trying to cut sugar, I’d recommend starting with less and tweaking the amount of cocoa until you get the right amount for you.
❤️❤️😍😍
I tried all of them but nothing beats the chai chia pudding yummy😋 thanks
Thnx for sharing yummy looks delicious and great idea for breakfast for a busy person esp in the morning b4 starting the day 👍🏻⭐🌹
❤❤❤
Mango pudding is there
I like the texture
Ok ok ok…..😮 I am so excited to try this.  Thank you so much for sharing ❤
Would like to know more about things that can be done with Matcha Tea Powder? Thank you
YUMMO!! Thanks much!! ❤
Peanut butter and banana.  I don't add sugar.
If you like the idea of chia pudding but don’t like the texture, just put all the ingredients in a blender and pulse a few times. It still turns out delicious but you don’t get that slightly slimy frog-spawn texture.
1:17 =ingredents in common for all the recipes   chi chia pudding= 2:26  matcha chia pudding 3:22 strawberry banana chia pudding= 3:36 COCO chia pudding= 4:06
مو طبيعي كيف هي عبقريه في الاكل
I made the chocolate one and it was so good only I added on top sugar free coolwhip and some nut topping very delicious
Hola the one that you mixed the banana and strawberry after you put in fridgerator then you topped it with mor banana and strawberry ?
Thank You!  you are fantastic.!!! awesome chia recipes, much APPRECIATED!!  going to do them all  going to be great for my weight loss!  having the first one now!!💯💖👏
Chocolate
I made a PB Dark Chocolate one yesterday and loved it
The bloopers are so cute. Strangely, I do the same thing & certain I’m the only one that messes up & starts over…A LOT!  Lol My fav would be the chocolate then matcha.    Two questions…do the Chia seeds soften completely and ok for diverticulitis patients? Also , same ? about flax seed?
I've got matcha i just bought, so the matcha chia pudding i will be trying
healthy
Chia seed pudding basic
I did it with almond milk and it never become pudding even after 8 hours the milk was still not like a pudding , more like a milk .
Chocolate with coconut milk.
I'm glad to see these recipes for Chia pudding. Honestly, I've only made Chia slurry for my dog to help his gut health ( & it aids in removal of the odd cat toy he may eat), so I am trying the new flavors for myself!😂
Does matcha have caffeine?
Can I use oak milk for chia pudding?
Mine turned out too thick and I had coconut milk chunks/pulp in it. Any suggestions?
For the chocolate I just use chocolate silk almond milk. Also I use premier protein shakes as the liquid.  It comes in many flavors plus it's 30mg of protein each bottle less than 200 cals
Wow YUMMY excellent BRAVO from paris thank you so much for this recipe excellent ❤
Going to do the coconut chocolate! ❣️❤️❣️🥰🥰🥰🙏
Matcha tea does not have flavor!!
I'm sorry, I crave sweet things but even I can't understand 1 tablespoon of maple syrup or honey for ½ cup 😲 of pudding. Are the chia seeds bitter?
I love these recipes.  Very easy and look delicious.  Can't  wait to try them
My choice  green matcha ,chocolate,and next strawberry banana  will try !
Wow they all look so good ❤️ Thanks for sharing 👏👏👏
Wonderful recipes. Thank you.
My favorite is coconut 🥥 milk chia pudding ❤
Combine oats
All of them !!; yummy !!
One criticism. You used cocoa powder instead of cacao powder. Sugar! 🤪
I looooove chia pudding! I’m gonna try making it with matcha
I literally have all these ingredients. ❤
I made it my mission to go and get all the ingredients for Chia pudding using your basic ingredients and my family and I love 😯🥰♥️😋this pudding so much I can't seem to make enough! 🥺😁. I've been making some with, goat milk, walnut milk, cashew milk, coconut milk, yogurt, almond milk and adding nuts, pistachios, walnuts, pecans, cashews, almonds, you name it I got it and berries, mangos, dragon fruit, pineapple, peach. . . Oh my goodness we made CHIA PUDDING a priority Top of the line pudding, hands down, bar none. #1 PUDDING IN THIS HOUSEHOLD. We also do tapioca 🤤😋😋😋 Oh! also For sweetener my family my and I seem to prefer MONK FRUIT.  Thank you for sharing.
oh God how much talking ))))
I’m going to try the chocolate.
Love them all
Also buy fresh lychee and a lychee beverage at the Asian market, pour the lychee drink at a base, add the chia seeds as well as some fresh small lychee. (they are shaped like large berries).
I’m fond of going to a well stocked Asian market, strolling down the frozen isle & selecting exotic fruits picked at the peek ripening time. Passionfruit or frozen pink Dragonfruit … I bought frozen slabs of Soursop yesterday.  Why frozen?  I’m located in Toronto, Canada where I find that the imported fruits are gassed or picked so green that the flavour nor sweetness remains ‘true’.  Thus,  with my frozen choice of the day - I blend up the fruit (usually with water OR nuts) and that becomes the 1/2 cup of pudding liquid before adding the sweetener and chia seeds. Every day is a different fruit.   Oh!  I always top up the chia pudding with some of the same fruit.
I did not make a new year resolution.  I think I will give Chia a go and hope it helps me with my health issues that has been overwhelming.
I was wondering if I can make it with extra creamy oatmeal milk, because I really don’t like coconut whatsoever?
U talk to much 😩
The chocolate chia pudding!!
I’ll have to try these 4 chia puddings! Looks delicious😋
Thanks for sharing! I’m going to make the strawberry banana one and top it on my açaí bowl!!
Is this good for post work out meals  in the evenings?
Strawberry and banana 😋
Looks so yumny! Mmmm!
Inspiring, thanks!!! 😊
I'm new to chia so I'm excited to try chia pudding. Thanks for the recipes. Chocolate is the one I'm looking forward to the most.

I was playing with flavors last night and found 2 that are amazing! First was 2tbsp of horchata powder mix and the other was 2tbsp of berry compote with 1 tsp of honey Both are heavenly.
Hi Dani, I don't like any type of milk! Can you pls give me something else to substitute milk? I need to loose weight,  hoping I can use chia pudding for breakfast.  Thank you!
Cette belle! Merci!

Hi Dani!  Found your channel recently after searching for healthy low fat, low sugar recipes to help y daughter recover after gall bladder removal surgery. We’ve made the Chia Pudding recipe several times this week already. It’s our new FAVORITE SNACK. So easy, healthy and DELICIOUS.

Light, pudding like, sweet enough, and a bit chewy to boot. Thank you for sharing your recipes.

These look divine. I am so confused though, how do you fit all of that in a 4oz mason jar? I bought the exact same kind but it's way too small?

The base for all: -One half cup of almond/vanilla milk -2 Tablespoon of chia seeds -1 tablespoon of maple syrup or honey
A bit late to the party here (it's now 2022), but thank you for the video. I put the chia seeds in my blueberry smoothie this morning. I am trying to stay "clean", as I have some medical issues and take WAY too many meds. Your videos help me feel better!!
This are amazing ideas for make the pudding chia and the deferents flavors. TFS.  I want to know where did you buy the small, glass containers, please? Blessings
Thank you for the great information.  I truly appreciate

👏👍🏻
Does chia seeds affect girls periods?
Yummy! 😍😋🥰❤️
Milk comes from mammals mammary cells, do not talk about coconut or almond milk, you can not milk a vegetable. Real raw milk is the best nutritious food
I think I will try the original base with banana
I love them all thank you so much!!😍
And thanks for the ideas.
Hi, I like the banana strawberry one.
CHAI….
I will try the chocolate but I'll put my own little twist on it like chocolate strawberry and banana 😋
This is my favorite  Base: 2 T. Chia Seeds 1/2 C. Almond Milk 1/2 Banana Mashed 1/4 t. Cinnamon 1 t. Honey Mix together and let set.  Topping: Few slices of banana  Chopped Walnuts
I like the strawberry banana 🍌 but really interested in the Matcha 🍵
It’s like she’s talking to preschoolers. 😥 plz it’s making it hard to listen. 😭
Can you just use less almond milk and more seeds? I hate hate hate when it’s runny. The texture grosses me out when it’s runny.
Strawberry banana🙂
Hey lady!! I love matcha🙂 I would love a video on matcha🙂🙂 I'm going to try all of these Pudding flavors but matcha flavor first lol🙂🙂😃

desculpem a demora perdi 4 tios e esposa de covide voltei de andador e ando pouco aqui
I'm really very much happy i eradicate my HPV two months ago. with the help of Dr Aluda on YouTube
I want to cry the way u did the green tea matcha. you need a chasen.
So I tried making this the other day I used a 1/2 a cup of milk 2 tablespoons of cheese and about one tablespoon of Maple syrup now I'm not sure not sure what happened but the  Chia seeds did not absorb the milk. Now I did use 1% Low fat milk. I also used H EB's brand of organic chia seeds,  I blended it all up together and of giant Mason jar but again nothing was really absorbed when I went to check on it about 2 hours later all the seeds risen to the top and the milk has sank to the bottom so I'm unsure if I did something wrong
Be careful with Matcha, if too much it can be very bitter. Thank you for this video!
My favorite: 2 tbsp chia seeds 1/2 cup water 1/2 cup Greek yogurt 28g cashews 1 tbsp cacao nibs 1 tsp vanilla extract  Delicious
I’m going to try this with a protein shake with the base for a delicious and high protein breakfast.
I’ll try them all first 😂
How long can you keep the chia pudding in the fridge?
To thicken it...can you add gelatin to a little milk then add to mixture? I’ve heard it’s a superfood?...
I'm allergic to almond milk. Will oat milk work?
I love this so much. I eat it every morning
I was just on a cruise and chia seed pudding was on the breakfast menu. AMAZING! I had it everyday and can’t wait to make my own.
https://youtu.be/7nhYlKPXjEo
Where can  buy those containers exactly the same size?
Chocolate!
Delicioso perfecto para un almuerzo
How many spoons of chia? Help
She speaks too fast. I can not get the receipt
LOL, Matcha tastes like grass but very good and healthy overall. I love all of the recipes, thank you so much for sharing! 🥰
Your chia recipes are really great! I just made the matcha chia pudding recipe. I was wondering if you will be doing a segment on Matcha Tea and cooking with Matcha? I would really like to learn more about it. Thanks Dani.
I'm not big on chia seeds 4 some reason but I do wanna fit them in2 my diet. Adding them 2 food or smoothies just didn't work 4 me. So hopefully the pudding will work. Also! I'm going 2 try the comment suggestion of freezing it so it's like ice cream. Now that might definitely work.. 👍😁👏💃😍
I tried the chocolate chia pudding and I loved It! This makes foe a great on-the-go snack. I am going to try strawberry and chocolate next. Thank you for sharing!
Hi I tried all of theses except for the Matcha one. I love the chocolate and the base recipe with fresh fruit and walnuts. It’s so good. I have been looking for a new, easy, on the go breakfast ideas that have a lot of protein, without eggs. I’m sick to nauseam of eggs. Thank you for this video.
Could you warm these up?
Provedite  prevedite
Chocolate
Even better than Chia seeds are ZEN BASIL SEEDS. HEALTHIER with no lectins. Prepare the puddings the same way!
👍👍👍😍😍😍🇸🇬
You talk too much
Yum going to try
I’m definitely trying the matcha one!
chocolate for the win
😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋
I used to have a terrible diet & then I was diagnosed w celiac.  Celiac, dairy free and vegan often get combined together in health food stores so I ended up way ahead of the game having to give up both gluten & dairy in the end anyway.  My fave is definitely the chocolate(easiest too) but I really like the idea of the apples on top of the chai one too. Chia seed pudding is one of my fave breakfasts next to overnight oats.
Was going to ask about texture.  Can you add a splash of mint in the chocolate?  Diabetic friendly?
why does mine not thicken up. i used almond milk. i eat for brealfast.
Thanks dear i will try it and let you know God bless you
Thank you for the recipe. They look so appetising. I can't wait to try them.
Always put chi seeds in water to soak or grind.  They can get stuck into your intestines.  I me a woman that told me story about her dad having surgery from the chi seeds in bedding into his intestines. It was a  serious operation
I like this !! However I'm a  Diabetic. Are any without  Stevia or honey?
It will have tone chocolate

Couldn't watch all the way you talk too much
Thanks 😊 I really love all the flavors. Ur awesome!
I hate the term, clean. What does that mean?
These are some amazing pudding recipes. Would definitely try these using true elements chia seeds and I know the resulting dishes would be very delicious and yummy. Thanks for sharing these recipes with us.
I will eat it fairly plain to keep carbs low as part of a ketogenic way of eating.  Maybe grated dark chocolate and raspberries on top. Thanks for sharing.
Just found you. THANKS! Macha 101 yes please.
This is my first time to make this. I know i will like it as i love tapioca. I have just made up all three bar the macha as i don't have it. 👍
I tried the banana and strawberry chia pudding and it tastes very good.Well done for your recipes they are very good and healthy.thankyou.
I liked tea and chocolate Thank you
I’m excited to try all of the flavors. I’m glad I stumbled upon your channel, I have tried some of your recipes and they are so easy and yummy 😋
Are these low carb?
I am Satvik , a 7 year old boy. I enjoyed the video and I like the one you chose with the almond milk in the video
I made a large bowl as a base batch and mashed a banana into it and used a combination of full fat coconut milk and almond milk.  After that soaked over night, I made a few dishes with cacao powder and a tad of maple syrup. My whole family loved it.  I also made one with peanut butter and no-sugar added cherry jam.  It was delicious.
I make my pudding in bulk and do 1 tablespoon to half a cup of milk so for example if I make 3 cups I use 12 table spoons and I do 3 tbls of maple syrup, it's not too sweet and its perfect. I always use almond milk
I'm going to try all four of them.
I’m going make a smoothie now I hungry
Damn these a lot matcha powder half would be fine  very exspensive
We need the omega
Can I use regular milk instead?
For 1 serving use half canned coconut milk and half almond milk to equal 1/4 cup each to 2 Tbs chia. Then sometimes I'll add 1tbs peanut pwdr and 1 tsp cocoa powder with a Tbs of powdered erythritol(swerve) sweetener, vanilla and cinnamon with a pinch of salt to taste. Stir till smooth a couple times during thickening process, then chill a couple hours. I make mine in 1 cup jelly jars for multiple servings. Top with your favorites.
2 thumbs up,   Add crush walnuts to the banana and strawberries.
I have just started eating chia pudding for breakfast and I love it.  I have never like eating eggs early and I love a good bread but was told I have a gluten allergy.  I love using coconut milk and berries.  I have also mixed it with quick oats and berries.  It makes for a filling breakfast.  Just remember to drink lots of water during the day.
Rice pouting
What are the toppings you added to chocolate chia Putting? Raspberries and ?
Chocolate chia Putting is my Fav!
Ill go for number one
I will try the Macha first thank you
Awesome ☺
I will certainly try them!!! Can we use Greek yoghurt instead of milk? I guess we can (?) I'm new to the channel. I like the way you present things :)
I will try the strawberry banana chia pudding!
Chocolate yum 🤤 going to make now 😊
I opened chia seeds bag a year ago and stored in glass jar. Used only half of it months ago  do you think  it’s still safe and good to use? Also great presentations
I was ready to try these but as soon as you said it’s like tapioca pudding you lost me. I can’t do tapioca 🤢
Yes please, matcha 101.,
I just discovered your channel! Sounds great! I already made the chocolate chia pudding 😋 We'll try it tomorrow morning 💜
Chocolate with banana would be delicious
Love it
These are such delicious and mouth-watering pudding recipes. These are really very easy to prepare, looks amazing & super healthy. One of my friend suggested me about a very Healthy and Clean Label Food Brand, True Elements and she is very happy about it. Tried this recipe using True Elements Chia Seeds and it turned out to be super tasty. Would highly recommend it to everyone. Do give it a try :)
They all sound delicious!
I like all four! I will be making them.
1:23 Recipe Begins! Yay! 🙂
Awesome 👏 recipe and thank you ☺️
Baloo berries??
The only dessert I eat is chia with organic cream overnight, with a bit of monkfruit sweetener.
Golden milk w/ ginger and coconut
So excited.  Thank you
Chocolate chia pudding for me, I have smashed the buttons. I luv the bloopers..lol #creatorprovlems
Thank you 😊
Chocolate pudding is my favorite. I will try out.
The base was so good with Oatly Oat milk !
Chocolate!!!!
new to this- do you ever use cows milk?
Love them all 😋
as four flavors look fantastic!
I just made the chai chia. I can’t wait to eat it in the morning!
Blueberries and almonds
Chocolate with using the coconut milk..! Plus!, some ground almonds on top.🥰😍
May Allah bless save cure protect you ameen
May Allah bless save cure protect you ameen
I made the Chai flavor overnight and just had it for a mid morning snack and it was amazing!!
I just made the chocolate one. So delish! I’m nice and full and not that overly full that makes you sluggish. But I honestly feel like my brain is thanking me for this delicious breakfast. Thank you!
I will try the coconut & chocolate
Thanks! We have jaggery over here in Srilanka.It is the.... sweetener in our country. Will try with that. But my favourite is chocolate chia.
Chocolate  chia pudding
What is the texture of the chia pudding? Is it a mixture where the seeds fall to bottom or does it form a suspension like a yogurt where seeds are suspended? How long does it take to get full effect - 4 hours of overnight?
What to do if your chia seeds don’t thicken up
I love matcha 🍵 I'd try it first 👍
.1 tablespoon of maple syrup 😱 surely you don’t need more than 1 tsp.
For the chocolate pudding can I use chocolate protein powder?
wayyy too much talking ...
Chia is really bad for as is goji berries , flaxseed is the one to go to not these
What she forgot to mention is...don't eat chia every single day because you going to run into other troubles health-wise. Eat it like once every 3 days or couple of times a week to fully benefit.
I would try to cocoa powder Chia first
Love you and your videos! Thank you so much!!! Stay safe 😘
I’m going to do them all!  I think that the chocolate will be my fav!
I've made the chocolate and my picky son ate it as well! The only thing is you can't have too much or you spend a long time in the bathroom...lol...unless that's me (I have digestive health issues).
Dani- I bought Chia seeds when stocking up and will unearth them! I really liked seeing the Cardamom. That has become a favorite! It is addictive! Note: King Arthur Flour catalog has three Christmas spices that contain Cardamom. I just ordered them and can't wait to try them! They also contain the standard Christmas and Thanksgiving spices, just a bit more fancy. Thanks for these recipes. I also have Matcha and was wondering how to add it to other dishes. ~ Diane
I want to start using chia seeds in my smoothies ( 3 table spoons ) that are made with an electric blender...  I'm concern & apprehensive that if I just add chia seed, turn on blender for 20 secs, then drink it down ( 32  oz ) the chia will later expand in my stomach causing havoc...  I could always put 9 table spoons worth of chia in jar with water & leave it over night in refrigerator then use it in morning & also ar noon or later in dad...  Please advise... Thank you...
My neighbor made the pineapple, coconut flakes and with coconut milk for her girls party. She bought a teaser over for us to try. I will make some slight alterations for us. But it was so good. Tasted like a pina colada!!  Yummy...
Thank you, I don’t like milk, would I get a similar result with using water?
That’s tapioca!! I always wondered what it was.
YES! Chocolate, raspberry, coconut, raisin, nuts! ANY of those are wonderful. Thank you for thus marvelous idea!
I had to try the chocolate.
Amazing ideas. Thanks for sharing them.
Do you need to pre-soak the chia seeds or does the almond milk already do the necessary soaking?
Super healthy pudding.Thanks a lot.
I have been eating the chocolate one with banana for months now. A staple.
You nailed this video. Thanks!
Thank you for the great content, quick easy and delicious! I’ve been making chia pudding for about a year now. One of my favs is 2 TBSP white chia seeds, 250ml of coconut milk, half a scoop of plant based protein powder. When it’s set, I add 1 TBSP puréed frozen mango, and plant based vanilla yoghurt. I layer it up on a tall glass with chopped banana on top…sooooo good! 😄💜
Can you give the calorie and carb content? If on Keto, can you make puddings with Light or Heavy Cream?
I’ve made pumpkin and it’s delicious 🤤
the green macha was terrible.......
How about a chocolate peanutbutter one!?
I do 1 can FF coconut milk, 1 scoop protein powder, 1/4 cup chia seeds ..I add anything extra my hubby wants. I switch from, chocolate, strawberry, vanilla. Yummy.
I like the fruit chia pudding also I love to soak oats in the almond milk and then add the toppings I like to set overnight and eat it for breakfast yum!!!👍
I don't enjoy thing that are cold. Can it be done at room temperature?
I love it .... I am using the Chia seeds in my Oatmeal in the morning ..... very delicious ..... my sugar improved and the Cholesterol as well.... so this method that you are using am I going to gain weight can I eat this in the morning or late night? Thank you for your great job ..... Cheers from Canada
Chia pudding is Overnight Oatmeal without the oatmeal.
Interest in matcha tea info .  I drink it everyday
Coconut milk container or can??? Thanks
Sorry, thanks for your upload. Can't wait to try the chocolate.
Just get to the recipe, for God's sake
Chocolate forever! 🤪
Keto friendly, as well! Definitely tying that chocolate one!
Chocolate of course. They all sound good.
Dani, you're alwats so much fun, but also super informative! i use chia in my smoothies, but have yet to make any pudding, but will try the choc., of course, and maybe  w/apples and bananas as other fruit is too costly now and shipped too far for the east coast where i live!!  will let u know how it is, ok? thx, will also try a few of your other recipes, so thx so much, :): kelli
Matcha 101 sounds good. How much liquid to 2 tablespoons of chia seed.
Ok got it
How thick does it get please
Chocolate
I know I'm going basic, but I wonder how it would taste with pumpkin spice 🤔.
It looks healthy and delicious 😋 l like to try it 😋
Thank you for  the recipes .
Chia pudding with cashew butter is my go-to 😍
nice
I will be trying the chocolate and strawberry  I have the ingredients at home.
What size container do you use?
I use cacao powder, coconut milk n toasted desiccated coconut shreded for my chocolate flavor chia pudding but my favorite is berry chia pudding jam😋😋😋
could you use whole  milk?? almond is not my favorite! but i can't wait to try!!!!
These are the most exciting recipes I’ve seen on YouTube.  A few times during your presentation you talk so fast That my 75 year old brain has trouble understanding what you are saying. Not so bad that I can’t use your recipes.  Thank you for sharing these recipes.
I have just discovered Chia and I am anxious to try the chocolate!
Chocolate for me🙌🏻🥰
Its 2021 and ive only just heard of chia seed pudding! absolutely in love 🤤 day 4 lockdown here in new zealand 🇳🇿😂
Can you just soak the chia seeds in plain water instead of any milks?
Really like the video and looking forward to trying the recipes. I would just point out that there are 4 recipes and if you hit the like button on each one as you suggest- you'll end up unliking it!
I have to try the chocolate  and the strawberry/banana both sound so good!!!
I literally followed this recipe word-for-word, step-by-step, and mine didn’t come out looking like that.
Hi all , I've recently started my own youtube channel with keto / lchf /low carb recipes  , and would really appreciate the support.  If you could click on subscribe.  I welcome all recipe ideas too :)👍👍🥰🥰🥰  Here is my YouTube channel link  https://youtu.be/njvqFrmPqPk
Beware cinnamon and restrict its intake, since it contains cadmium, witch is heavy metal ☠️
This is so good and straightforward, liked and subscribed
you'd hope they are 'clean' lol #dietculture
How can I print these recipes?
Wow I like it 👌
Coffee chia yogurt with berries n spices are my homemade specialty. Yummy!
I’m so glad I found your channel
this video sucked
Doesn’t coconut milk have a lot of saturated fats? I love coconut but it’s high in that fat!
I’m happy to have found your channel. Haven’t had chia before, I will definitely try the chocolate. It looks delicious. Thank you for sharing!
I enjoyed your chia pudding recipes and will try them.
I'm on KETO so I will try chocolate and Matcha green Tea!👍🏻😃
Lost me on the sweetner.  Sounds delicious,  but not keto
I'm just going to use chocky milk
Can this be made with Skim cow milk, I did try making it once but mine didn't set properly and thick. Was way too liquidy. I did put 1 tablespoon of chia to 250 ml milk.
Oh my gosh the chocolate one is DELICIOUS
At size jars are you using?
Looks great, but definitely not Keto.
Thanku
I can’t have chocolate, I use carob powder
please make a macha 101 video
Chocolate.  Will try coffee
Love the
Will be trying this for sure. Would increasing the chia to milk ratio make for a thicker pudding like texture? It looks a bit too runny for me but don’t want to use whole milk….
I like chocolate so I'm thinking the chocolate ones going to be my favorite one
BoLth???
Thank y'all so much dearest 🌹 Y'all such an inspiration 🥰 Appreciate y'all from the bottom of my heart 💖 Be Blissful Eternally 🙏👼🌈
I think I have to try chocolate pudding first but I think I will add a few walnuts and almonds.
Does the sweetener have to be liquid_
Chia and chocolate sounds delicious
What is the size of your jars? :)
Peanut butter & banana
Allergies to almonds and cashews… can I use Greek yougart?
Delicious 😋
I love the way they look. Cant wait to make them !
I just discovered this and I wanted to share: the growth of superfoods like chia seeds and quinoa are often devastating to the environment, where sustainability is forfeited for short term economic profit. Here is a YouTube video about this topic: Superfoods: https://youtu.be/tRRoYeKztbY If this wasn’t enough of a shock, there is also a dark side to the salmon and avocado industry. Here is a YouTube video with more information: Salmon and avocados: https://youtu.be/mcYr040cLNc The solution is to shop locally and sustainably. Not only are you supporting your local businesses, but you can also be sure that you are not supporting an industry that has high emission levels resulting from international transportation of goods. In addition, you can also be sure that national health guidelines are being followed in the growth of food that you are consuming.
Thank you for sharing! Where do you get those jars?
I just made the chocolate pudding with coconut milk and that’s probably going to be my next obsession. Thank you so much!
can i use just a cow milk would it work ?
Yes do receipts with matcha
Love all 4 so delicious yummy 😋❤️
CACAO
Looks good 😌
I'm going to try chocolate flavor first..
Definitely the chocolate! Lol
add a teaspoon almond butter to the choc pudding, you can sweeten with stevia and throw in  a little vanilla and it's like a reese's peanut butter cup.  Add the choc pudding with almond butter to the blender with crushed ice and it tastes like iced cappuccino.
I would definitely try all 4 flavors 👍😊
Plain chia with blueberries.
Thanks for posting the recipes.  That's awesome. Don't understand why others don't do that.
CHOCOLATE SOUNDS FASTEST AND MOST SIMPLE
I knew I would like the chocolate !   Hit like at the beginning.
Love these! If you really want to get decadent - use coconut cream and some vanilla.
Are these 4 or 8 oz jars? Looking forward to trying this.
They also make a good (CHIA SEEDS) EGG substitute but I don’t know the correct measurement.
Have you ever tried to bring these ingredients to a boil before freezing? I wonder if the high temp would help the chia seeds absorb more fluid and result in a more pudding consistency.
Off course the chocolate pudding will be the first for me%
Loved it thanks!!
i tried the chocolate Chia pudding, it was yummy :)
It’s so delicious and easy to make. Loved it. Thank you !
Hi, can the kids also enjoy this ?
Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.” ((John 14:6))
Matcha tastes like bush, just saying. Nobody warned me
Hi -- saw it with my own eyes so I know it works, but curious about the physics.  You're adding 4 oz of milk (1/2 cup) plus multiple ingredients (one that actually expands) -- to a 4oz jar, right?  How does it all fit?
I am racing to make the Green Matcha Flavor! Yum! I already love Chia pudding. So fun and easy. Thanks.
Yum! I really want to try the spicy dip, sounds awesome, Thank you, as always for such wonderful support.
Chocolate 🥰
You are awesome it’s pleasure to watching you it’s treat.
LOVE THE CLEAN AND DELICIOUSNESS I’VE NEVER TRIED CHIA BEFORE I CAN’T WAIT TO TRY ALL OF THESE RECIPES!
Blueberry and Banana chia pudding yum.
Never had chia.  So I will start with the chocolate version and full fat milk
You are just wow. Healthy and tasty puddings. What else we need.
Are you supposed to chew chia seeds!?

Going to try
Can you make coffees mocha chia vanilla pudding please?
I love chia
Can I use normal milk?
Hi Dani!  Just me loving and enjoying your videos!  So professional yet unpretentious!  I can feel the love in your family!  So sweet!  Good for you!  Binge watching your videos and telling you a secret:  you have helped me so much with your healthy recipies and explanations!  Thank you!  I'm watching you a lot and you are cheering me up as I am isolated during the pandemic!  I get the vaccine in another week or so but will still be working on being careful till we are all out of the woods so to speak.... if that can happen... Good luck to you!
I gotta have blueberries

I'm going to usevhoney instead of maple syrip
At this point i have to admit i’m addicted to chia seed pudding videos 😫😩
TEAM CHOCOLATE!!
I'm making the banana strawberry straight away.. Thanks.
what size jars are you using?
Just had the chocolate Chia pudding. So gooooood !! I added coconut and strawberries.
I wonder what people a hundred years ago would say about these dainty foods
Great recipe. I made mine apple, banana walnut. Loved it . Thanks
Where do u buy matcha paste
I use the same base recipe but then I always add greek yogurt--it is so creamy and makes it so much more pudding-like in texture. Also adds more protein! :-)
The Matcha with banana + pecans AND coconut!
Love the matcha and chocolate. I make the chocolate and add toasted hazelnuts and coconut.
Is this good for people who are diabetic?
I love the chocolate with coconut, soooo good
Can I use yougurt instead of milk in it for breakfast?
She talks too much
The chocolate sounds inviting,

I like chia
Hi...I wanted to find out how your smoothies come out green.  When i try to make a green smoothie, it. Never comes out green.  I use kale, almond milk, 1/4 frozen banana, 3/4 cup: blueberries and strawberries.   Tell me what makes it green?
I think i will try the chocolate.
Matcha 101
Two tablespoons of chia seed, one half teaspoon of cinnamon powder, one half teaspoon of Macca powder , one half tablespoon of honey. Mix up in milk and leave in fridge overnight. Try not to pig out in the morning. Delicious!!
7
Can it be done with cow milk? Dont kill me
Great video thanks!
I mix chia seeds with one container of non fat Greek yogurt in the morning for my nighttime snack. Even extra protein.   Love it.
um.... def not more omega 3 than Salmon ..for human use lol.... but cool vid
My chia seeds dont get bigger in liquid. Why???😭😭😭
How long do you have to let it rest before you can eat it? I wanna make this for breakfast before work, but I think you have to let it rest for 4 hours or overnight?
Can I use yogurt?
I want to try the chia and then the matcha. Awesome 😎
I Love the chocolate pudding.
Where can you buy matcha powder!?
Hi, how many tea spoon of chia seed can you have at a time. Doest it have a cooling effect to the body or heated effect pls anwer
Just started using Black Chia Seeds and drinking with water wasn’t doing it for me so , I found you yaaaaaa👏🏽👏🏽😂 thank you so much I just mixed up my first pudding today I made one with strawberry and the other mixed blueberries. I can’t wait to taste it .  Thank you , thank you , THANK YOU!!!
Almond butter and low sugar jelly on top. My fave
Vivo
Definitely need to try this tomorrow, looks amazing 😋
I made a vanilla mixed berry chia pudding.
Chi seeds are dangerous , I couldn’t poop for days and was in so much pain !
I tried it with the sweetened almond milk,1/4tsp of cinnamon and 2tbls of chia seeds. It reminds me of tapioca pudding! Yummy!
Thanks.
can i use cow or buffalo milk with chia seeds?
Banana strawberry
Thank you. I was searching for a healthy quick breakfast .
Make it shorter please otherwise it’s great thanks
Everything but the coconut ones sound good. I like all the other 3 flavors. Team Chococlate indeed. I would love to try that.
I was waiting for a dessert replacement . This it is
Loved it made banana strawberries....trying all 4 flavous... thqqqq
Does anybody know how long we have to leave the pudding in the fridge ?? would it work if i put it in the freezer to speed the process
Can we make all flavour and store in refrigerator .for couple of days
Chocolstr
They all look yummy
Am going to matcha chia pubbing
I used peppermint tea in mine instead of macha powder. I don't think the peppermint did anything but it was nice feeling creative lol. Maybe the teabag I used wasn't powerful enough (or I diluted it with water too much). I have condensed milk so I use hot water on the seeds first then milk (because I don't like thick milk)
Interested in Matcha 101!
I did this WITHOUT sweetener and it was fantastic! The ripe banana was all the sweetener it needed.  1 cup unsweetened soy milk  2 tablespoons carob powder (roasted)  3 tablespoons chia seeds  1 tablespoon hemp heart seeds  1 ripe banana  1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon  next time I'll add some vanilla
I Love how you prefer maple syrup as a natural sweetener. I will have to give this a try
I tried them all, but chocolate is always my favourite :)
Diabetic note...DO NOT USE STEVIA EVER! If you are a diabetic Stevie can affect your blood glucose just like regular sugar! I have been using Monk Fruit for over a year with no adverse effects, but get it without being cut with any other sweetners (Amazon)!
Delicious 😋
My chia pudding doesn’t thicken 😕 I’m not sure what to do.  I have tried it with regular milk and almond milk, but neither of them work. I don’t know what I am doing wrong, I have had it in the fridge for about 7 hours and it is still liquid.
Can I add moringa?
Can any chia seeds be used for this?? I ask cause some one say that their chia seeds didn't swell and they soaked them over night
Who’s watching in 2020 in Quarantine tryna stay healthy
Chocolate chia Pudding
I do not use any sweetener but instead add a spoon of blackberries or raspberries the vanilla Almond milk has 15 gms sugar.
OMG I made 5 Chia Pudding Recipe with fruits such a delicious Breakfast come i see my Videos on My Chanel
Hello everyone,  can someone tell me what size are the Mason jars that she is using? So excited to try this😊
I thin I would try the Chocolate first
I Love your recepies they are so yummy ans flexible. My Favorit Channel 😘
You must be popular with Americans cause you treat your audience like they're 4 yr olds.  This is not for me, I prefer to be spoken to as an adult. All the best.
I will try them thanks
Gonna do chocolate!
Hello Dani, thank you for sharing this yummy Chia pudding! Are these Mason jars 4 ounces or 8 ounces?  Because on your link (Amazon) it shows 4 ounces so I’ve ordered them and they look quite small. Or maybe they are really 4 ounces but just look big on your video?
Can I give this pudding for kids? 3 & 5 years old
These look really nice imagine the taste.
You look like that actress from full house
More Mach green tea recipe
I like the mango Chia pudding with coconut milk, maple syrup it’s so good
Love these! As much as I eat chia pidding, I need ideas for variety! I only use coconut milk. No sweetener needed & it thickens like a rich pudding. 😁
Chocolate raspberry is my fav , Tnx girl ♥️
Chocolate cocoanut.will try it .
Haagen you ever tried pistachio chia seed pudding, With cinnamon and a little bit a honey? Just wondering if anybody out there tried it
Chocolate with soy milk and coconut flakes is in the fridge as I type:) can’t wait. Thanks!!!
Finally I found this channel 😊🙏
Does it have to be in a tight covered glass jar?
I ground my chia seeds up for a smoother texture. I used almond milk a little pure vanilla then drizzled pure maple syrup over it when ready and chopped pecans.....For hubby I took angel food cake then put the vanilla chia pudding on top and put chopped strawberries on top of a that....he’s not into Healthy...🥴
This is a wonderful video, gave a very good advice how to make healthy breakfast from chia seed, We have an article about it https://www.fashioncoders.com/healthy-breakfast-recipe-chia-seed-parfait/ let's see
The carb and sugar levels of these recipies concern me for diabetics. Comments Clean and Delucious!
Can you just you,s water ? I can’t have milk
I love strawberries.
Is this recipe one serving? Or two?
Definitely going to be trying the cocoa powder chia pudding! I will probably change the topping a bit and add banana with some walnuts 😋  Thank you for your amazing content! I enjoy ALL your videos!!!!!!
I love ❤️ this best pudding ever. Thank you.
How come mine doesn’t fit in the jars? I got the same ones that were in the description and it doesn’t all fit. They taste great though btw 😋
Oh my Matcha 🤤
Thank you for the nutrients information. Where did you find information?
Hi guys! Did u put it in the fridge  or the freezer?❤
Is chia seeds good for constipation?!
I've tried chia seeds with Milk but it's not growing big unlike with water...
Chocolate
Chocolate 😋
Hi, i dont drink milk, can i use water or yogurt?.thank you
Love your videos. Thanks for not rambling and getting right on the topic and not straying. No time wasted. Makes it easier to watch.
I tried making the pudding. But, my chia seeds didn't swell up like yours although I left them over night. Next time I tried with hot water. This time, they did swell within minutes, but they smelled fishy. Is there something wrong with my chia seeds?
Anything chocolate
I don't know why but you kinda look like Ashley (Pressley's mom) from Dance Moms 😂
I am going to try the chocolate chia pudding with a little unsweetened coconut add to it.
Question about the maple syrup. Are you using real maple syrup, as in tapped from the tree and no preservatives or store bought log cabin mae syrup?
I once tried making Chia Pudding, but didn't really like it. I'll try to follow your recipe hoping it'll give me a new appreciation for it. 😊
How many calories are in these puddings.
I would rather have it thicker.  Add more chia?
You speak too much about food.
https://youtu.be/T3bSRlzzr_0  Watch for more easy way..
Wauwww yummy yummy, love it, thank you so much for Sharing

Salmon and Chia has completely different types of Omega-3 ( DHA and EPA) so no need to compare
Hi thanks for the recipes! I just ordered some jars from the link above. I want to know more about matcha.
You remind me of Arizona Robbins from grey's anatomy. The same bubbly and bright nature..😁
My purpose is to have my cholesterol to drop from 245 to 199, the least, with the use ofthis cholesterol guide “Hοzantο Axy” (Google it). Luckily, in only just a few weeks, I have it decreased to 216. I made it happen without doing big changes  on my diet program. .
More chia seeds adds thickness
Dark chocolate peanut butter pudding with a touch of cinnamon
Thank you for sharing!
pl try this recipe https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTvLnCXCTdY&t=205s
I think grinding it is a great idea. Because when I soak it the way it is it does not swell.
Heaven heaven heavenly
Thanks a million for sharing very nice mother earth is healing from Kenya respect and honor sharing beautifully tips best dish very beautiful soul god bless
What if I only have ground chia at this moment, will it work?
Delicious but too much simple carbs. And milk prevents absorption of some minerals like iron. There are healthier recipes out here.
Grrrreat!! Greetings from Mexico!!
My favorite chia seed pudding flavor is the pbj- peanut butter (or almond butter) mixed in with the milk and strawberries on top for that jelly 💖
I made this with the almond milk, and it’s just as thick if not thicker. Just store it in the fridge for a good 15 minutes or overnight.
New to mason jars, are these the 4 oz wide mouth ones? Love this video, thank you.
wish u display the text at the bottom its eye annoyoing
oh god she talks so much.. liked first.. then unliked and removed from saved ... sorry... idea not bad though, cut the talk!! :D

Made it  today with fresh mango and coconut milk flavoured with saffron and green cardamon.  Will like to try with almond milk.  What was the topping in the chocolate one?
THANKS FOR THE TIPS.
Going to try all new subscriber you’re amazing 😉💪💪💪💕
I make the chocolate raspberry with almond milk, I add about 2 TBSP of my chocolate whey protein powder. to break my 20 hr fast almost daily. So good! I will try the matcha one, honestly all of your recipes are amazing! Thanks so much for sharing glad I found your channel!
Hi thanks they look delicious ok thanks for explaining cause I love coconut milk then almond milk ur new subscriber.
Can you Chew chai seeds ?
Greatest recipes
I made the chocolate chia pudding and it was delicious. Thank you! Can you link the and provide us with the name of the jars that you used? Thanks so much :)
Can you add plain Greek yogurt to thicken it up?
I just made some for the first time and they’re delicious!! I love that they’re healthy too😍😍😍
what does chia pudding taste like
I LOVE CHIA CHOCOLATE PUDDING .NICE RECIPIES
Just made the Chia Chia pudding and it is delicious! <3
Looks absolutely delicious 😋 I love the idea to make it with coconut milk.
i love  all of them  dani
I remember the first time I made chia pudding I didn’t know you had to refrigerate it and I just ate a soupy mess 😂
Love them all!
Do you have to chew on the seeds in order to digest and absorb the nutrients, because it’s not the easiest to do! I tried ground chia seeds once and the taste was like a bitter nutmeg, ew! Would it be the same thing if I immersion blend it before or after it’s been in the fridge to avoid that flavour?
Nice :)
can somebody explain how cinnamon+clove+cardamom is chai to her? like, wtf
I've been doing keto for a while now (in excess of three years) and have never tried this... With the required isolation and the words you said "tapioca pudding" you've got me sold,lol! Thank you for the video and the excellent ideas
My mom got a big bag of chia seeds and i thought i would put them to use! I cant wait tpo try this later
I am an avid eggs-for-breakfast kind of gal.  I think I need to change up my routine and Im gonna start with having this for breakfast.  Thank you for the ideas, they sound amazing.  I love chai but do not have those spices on hand yet.  I think I will start with my pumpkin spice mix instead.  Excited to see more from you!  Where do I find the matcha 101?
I am new to your channel and love it!  Thank you!  Would love to see more recipes w/ Matcha!!
I have made this again and again! Love it!!
OMG!! I can’t believe how people start to get crazy about some “super food” without knowing all about it, you eat it like if it would be not contradictions like absorption on calcium and zinc and you need to drink a lot of water if you eat so much seeds, that’s why most of times in the countries that grown with this seed only drink in water or use it like when you use cinnamon in some milkshake.
I'm curious about matcha. I tried some with dusting it on some nuts and it was pretty good!
Yes, I am interested in a matcha 101  video!  Thank you!
chocolate
Everytime I make chia pudding, the seeds clump up and stick to the bottom of my jar. Am I supposed to keep mixing until it gels?
Making the chocolate one tonight 😍
There is a brand called Chia pod that makes these really cute Chia puddings if you are in too much of a rush. Of course it's a waste of plastic and I always reuse the little containers and spoons. It literally comes with a little spoon that you can eat with. They are delicious. They have banana, a vanilla bean and my favorite is their blueberry. But you can't find them anywhere anymore. Which is why I am here. Also Walmart sells organic chia seed very cheap. Well worth the purchase.
Wow, so much information in the drop-down menu. Really well done video! 🙌🏻 😁
Can we use dairy milk for the pudding?
Video starts at 1:22
Healthy chia seeds! LiveHealthy! ▶️
Not really healthy though but she needs to sell some stuff
Why do my chia seeds not expand almost at all?? Even if I leave them in  almond milk throughout the night? :(
I just did my first chia pudding ever, I tried the chocolate one, it was great! Thank you for these recipes!
I like Chia Seeds because of their consistence but 5 grams of protein are like nothing. You  shouldn't eat more than 3 Tablespoons a day so it's not really a good protein source. Also I've read that the body can't process the Omega-3 of the Chia Seeds well.
You are the savior of my sweet tooth ❤❤❤❤
I live chocolate any thing
I just made the chocolate pudding only because the ingredients were handy.  Looking forward to breakfast
Do the seeds stay crunchy?
I made your recipe. I’ve never had chia before other than in tea. Made it and love ❤️ it. I found another recipe using heavy cream.....🤢yuck.. I’m baaaaack and here to stay!!!
Very healthy
I’m new to chia pudding but I added a teaspoon of beet powder to mine to sweeten it. It was really good!
Nailed it again!
I just popped the strawberry and bananas chia pudding in the fridge... we’ll see 😊
Can I use canned coconut milk?? Please and thank you.
Hi! I’m sorry to bother you I was just wondering if I could use these in these recipes.   https://www.walgreens.com/store/c/carrington-farms-organic-flax-chia-blend/ID=prod6388151-product
Do the chia seeds soften up whilst in the fridge or do they stay hard?
Thanks!  First time I tried I put too many seeds not enough milk. Now I know the correct measurements. Thanks! 💃🏻
I wanna try the matcha flavour😍😍😍😍😍😍 i am obsessed whit matcha. Its my new favorite flavour and of course the chocolate chia pudding. I love chocolate pudding😍😍😍😍😍😍😍

Strawberry nd chocolate pudding is best for me
Made the chocolate chia pudding this morning! Absolutely delicious! I don’t think I could ever go back! Definitely recommend everyone try it out! So simple and so easy. Thank you!
I loved the recipe, will definitely try
Can i use frozen fruit for the strawberry and banana version?
Maybe it’s healthy but it’s not a pudding at all~
Anti inflammatory-let's do it -its 2020 guys :)
Oh my god you did say to much talking! Couldn’t even watch the whole video! Super annoying!!!
Cacao or coco?
Good job on all.
You don’t need to put it in the fridge for 4 hours. 10 minutes is enough to thicken it up.
I already hit your buttom
Just foind you. I subscribe!
Does it need to be put in the fridge for some time?
I tried coconut milk but it’s mostly solid. Couldn’t blend it but mixed in chunky coconut milk anyway and today it’s just one big solid pudding with some liquid on bottom. What coconut milk is available that’s liquid?
Can you eat this every morning
I make pineapple banana chia seed pudding. I use fresh pineapple, bananas, organic coconut/almond milk, organic raw honey and a dash of organic ginger. For my topper I add a few slices of banana and a few cubes of pineapple. DELICIOUSNESS GALORE!!!! 💋
It would be good to note that Chia Seeds are rich in fiber and too much fiber in your diet, may cause constipation. This recipe seems to have a lot of fiber for those of us who already get enough fiber in our diets.
I have to try the chai flavor first. Thank you for the ratios for each!
Try it with real raw milk. You wont buy plant juices ever again.
More omega-3 than salmon? Maybe, but they are useless garbage since body has very poor conversion rate from ALA to DHA/EPA. I carry a gene what even more inhibit conversion. Nothing beats salmon.
2017! wow! Just finding out what Chia Pudding is now (end of 2019)....just stumbled upon it. Cant wait to try it!!! All 4 looks good, but the matcha coconut sounds so delicious!!
blending the dry chia seeds seeds first will be better for you digestive system
i ll try choclate pudding first.my diabatic husband gonna love it.
Is it okay for yogurt?
Matcha 101 please!
Chocolate chia pudding
I added some oatmeal and its delicious
How much time you need to rest the chia into any liquid before eaten to avoid being too hard and dangerous?
Skip to 2:20
I can't wait to make the matcha!! But i don't have coconut so I'll add banana. I cant wait to make full fat coconut chocolate chia pudding!! What a healthy dessert!! 🍌🥥🍵
Chocolate
I use milk kefir.wide neck jam jar  frozen blueberries and cherries,any fruits will do,and my chia seeds mixed together,leave in fridge overnight.Breakfast ready to go.also put chia seeds mixed in my smoothie .
only one issue with Chia seeds you run out of energy fast.
Dreaming of this with coconut creme ☺
I love matcha!!! so matcha it is!
Thank you so much! Super helpful video
i’m here because of Novak Djokovic
Fantastic
I love them all, I'm going to make them all.
Chocolate !!
Never had it but going to sure try it
Great video thank you !!
I don’t like syrup I might try agave nectar.
My chai chia pudding is in the fridge right now! Thanks for the recipe.
I dont know if im late to the party or not, but i'd appreciate that macha video
Where do you get full fat coconut milk? Is it different than coconut milk in cartons?
Hello! I would like to have an opinion on chia seeds, since I just bought a bag of it and have been using it on drinks these past few days. I've only consumed about half a spoonful of the seeds and soak them on either milk of creamer if I want to have coffee. I've also searched that chia can be consumed either once or twice a day. But I or ally just want to be sure. How much do you take for consumption, drink wise, and how many times a day/week???
I definitly gone a try the others one. I eat the chocolate chia coconutmilk breakfast a lot.  This is deliciouss👌🏻😋😋😋😋
Strawberry Banana sounds delicious!
All of them‼️💕
What the calories in these chia pudding?
Your banana ice cream brought me here. Thanks for your videos,  new subscriber here.👍
Coffee flavor? Maybe you could use coffee and milk as the base liquid
The chocolate one 😋👍
Thank you! Excited to try my pudding tomorrow morning
Thanks for the very upbeat and informative video. God Bless You & Yours.
Hey hun only just discovered chia seeds, but add mine everyday now to my oats, dried apricots and dates and add almond milk or cashew milk, then drink a glass of hot water with lemon beforehand to start my digestion. Paula aged 64 in the UK x
Chia seeds is high in fiber , I get painful stomaches and irritability . Anyway to substitute ?
I would like a matcha 101! Please
Chia seed have some great nutritional benefits but calling them creamy? I would say more gelatinous. That being said these are some really good chia pudding ideas. Adulting is hard.
Thanks for sharing this video. I haven't tried it yet but I will try it one at the time. Thanks 😊
Awesome 😊...thanks for sharing.
Does this recipe work with dairy milk?
No  sweetener?
Please subscribe channel Afsha minuteshttps://youtu.be/_PvBbuoAjwg

I found your channel I love your recipes Awesomeness. Thank you 🙏
Chocolate  all the way ! Thank you so much this is great
Chocolate!!!!!
Im going to try all of them looks  delicious
You, Madame, have just changed my life. The chai chia seed pudding is what's been missing from my life... I knew there was something :-) also you are adorable with a dash of sassy.
Great ideas!
I loved the chocolate pudding the best. I also make a turmeric chia puddind
Chia seeds or one of those things I can’t stomach. They are disgusting.
Can I add melted chocolate to the chaco one? As a a substitute of cocoa powder?
I'm going to try all of these right now I'm making the chocolate one
Great ideas! I think I'll try them all, except maybe substitute banana with melon
This looks so delicious can't wait to try making these,  Thank u very much for ideas and sharing it with us. 👍❤
Chocolate ❤
looks like frog eggs be grate dessert for Halloween. looks gross.
Pandan is another good flavour to add with coconut. Will be green colour too. It's similar to tapioca seed pudding. 🤣🤣
Chocolate 👍🏼
Can you use regular whole milk?
Definitely the macha and chocolate
Excellent info!  Thanks!  Yummy!  I can’t wait to try it!
I just found you. Where have you been all my life? Lol 😄💖
Interested on your 101
Want to try all. Thanks 😊
Can you leave this in the Fridge over night?
Choc chia with coconut milk. Yum
Can we cure instead of milk ?
😍👌🏻😍
i made a chocolate chia pudding buy using  3 tablespoons of chia seeds 1cup of chocolate/brownie milk 1 tablespoon of nutella 2 dollops of golden syrup it’s so yummy 😋 i recommend it!
Is it safe to eat that much amount of Chia in a day? I get constipated after 2 teaspoon of Chia seeds.
Tried the Chai Chia pudding. So delicious.  This morning I added chopped apples, toasted unsweetened coconut and 1-1/2 tbsp Greek yogurt.  For sweetener I used  1/2 tsp stevia and it was just right❤️
Choc !
Big like
I just discover this chia puddings, so I decided to make one tonight, so I used a fruit called uchuva, I googled it and turned out to be cape gooseberry, its a little orange ball that tates sweet/acid I tasted the spoon right after mixing and WOW, incredible. Tomorrow might taste even better
Mine continues to have a crunch. Very frustrating.
Love chia pudding.  I use almond milk. Add small pieces of apple, cinnamon and some honey.  Perfect for breakfast.
Bana
I made the strawberry banana and added a tablespoon of dark cocoa powder, soy milk instead of almond and honey instead of syrup and 👌🏻🤤
This looks like a great idea . I was wondering if I could double or triple the base amount so I can make 3 different servings (flavors) at  one time ?  Refrigerate and eat one daily.   Thanks so much for suggestions .
Chia seed swell better with pure water... After they swell, filter it out and add to the base..
Can anyone tell me the difference between chia seeds and basil seeds please?
Too bad I’m allergic to chia seeds.
I made some with Almond extract and monk fruit
I like chocolate 🍫 and strawberries 🍓 chia pudding 😊
every recipe I've seen for these have been with almond/coconut/any other vegan milk, but I'm curious if it'll work with regular cow milk?
Will regular cow milk work??? I know I just called it cow milk
I stir the dry ingredients into a paste before adding the milk; this makes it easier to stir into the milk.
I've not yet got my nerve up to try chia seeds. Is there any crunch at all when you make the pudding?
When I make this the chia seeds have soaked up so much liquid that the pudding is kind of hard. Help
I recently made a mango strawberry with cocoa which turned out really good and I did use coconut milk because it paired well with the mango and I wanted it creamy
Yummy recipe
Amazing. Thank you. I love tapioca. I used your base with monk fruit . I added fresh coconut. I added pumpkin spice with cinnamon and cloves. Yummy.
Maple syrup is sooooo healthyyy!!!
I 💗 🍫 flavoured things. Can you please do more healthy foods.
I will surely try the banana and strawberry one
Made it.  I think it is delicious however my kids don't like the seed texture.
CANT WAIT TO TRY THESE!!! THANK U!!
Yes one on one matcha
Yum!!
hi, is it working with chia powder? :)
These look amazing!🤩  will definately try the matcha and chocolate recepies.
I’ve never had chia pudding but love chia seeds so I def want try the chocolate and chi recipes!!
Can I make it with whole milk?
My roommate made these and gave me one, OMG!!!!!! my tummy has never been so happy, and I swear I could eat it everyday of my life!! Thank you for this recipe!
Let's try coffee powder with coconut milk top with orange slices..
Can regular milk be used?
Very good video. Easy to follow and I like that the pudding base is different for each recipe as opposed to just changing the topping. I just made the chocolate one and it's delicious!
Chocolate 🤙
Think I’ll make matcha one and chocolate one.  Thanks 🤗
Chocolate of course
These aren't normal puddings, these are slimy messes. Chia pudding has ALA, the useless omega 3. You can't digest them. You have to crush them to get inside and get the few nutritients it has. Chia seeds are literally a scam. You'll just shit them out if you eat it like that
Matcha lover here 🙋‍♀️ I'm gonna try it!
Interesting. Will have to try this
Thanks so much for this video. I meal prep every Sunday and made these for the first time today. So yummy .
Chocolate for sure am trying it today
Hi I am interested in the green tea and coconut chia pudding
Thank u for ur recipe.im going to try banana strawberry is my favorite.god bless u.
I've never had Chia Pudding... this looks amazing 😍
1:24 - Chia seed pudding base 2:20 - Chai chia pudding 2:43 - Matcha coconut chia pudding 3:35 - strawberry banana chia pudding 4:02 - chocolate chia pudding
If I do slightly less almond milk will it become thicker?
Coconut milk from a can?
Thanks for sharing this idea. One question here. Are Chia seeds roasted or raw?
Chocolate with pb2 but I think the pumpkin spice would be a Fav. I use cashew milk
I made the basic and added a touch of vanilla, cinnamon, maple syrup, banana,  strawberry, and whole  milk which makes it thick like pudding!  So delish!  I warn you though....those small serving sizes...too small!  Like dessert...you’ve got to have seconds!  She’s right, you can make them however you want!  Thank you chia pudding lady! 😀
Will have a go with choc one first ... thanks for sharing.
I made it with coconut milk but it did not get dense at all 😩
Super ones.. not sure abt matcha yet though
For some reason, when I added the cocoa powder, it didn’t wanted to mix properly. All the cocoa powder stayed on the top no matter how much I mixed with a spoon
I ate the chocolate chia pudding just now for breakfast and I loved it!  Thanks so much.
I really enjoyed the refreshing taste and wonderful breakfast change or mid-afternoon snack.  I like the chocolate pudding and vanilla, cinnamon-raisin. I also add a little protein powder.
Yummm !! So simple to make ! Thanks
Gotta try one.
Iwill try the chocolate.
Going to try matcha first! Thanks for this!
Chocolate ❤
Thank you very much....I was in dilemma that which recipe I should make....it helped me
Balooberries gets me .
Hi (to all my 100% loyal family)  Anyhow, so I think I figured out a few things. (About my enemies)   1. About my enemy ESTP he’s a “double edged sword” and how his last name is “stukov” or something like that.  And then Kerrigan = Alexis stukov  (Or however you spell it)  since Kerrigan’s son is “Peterson” (which is the 4w5 aka “Pain”).  That’s why there was that one video I remember it said something like  “My BF’s friend happened to be his son”  (or something like that) (And that couldn’t have been me, since the ESTJ 14 Asian is my wife, and I’m her husband)  And then there’s that one video that said today  “If the emperor had a text to speech device” (Picture showing dead and then alive) The Emperor is ( the 4w5 aka “Pain”) And how this all makes sense is that.  “Kusaki the original sword of Japan” Meaning that, the ESTP and the ESFP were pretty much just playing the Lizardman.  “Total war 2 How to Play the Lizardman”  (Since the ESTP and the ESFP are both 2’s)  (The Lizardman is the 4w5 aka “Pain”)   And also another thing is.   The reason why the ESFP 2 (my enemy) is called “mass effect” is because she plays the Lizardman (the 4w5 aka “Pain”). Well because the Lizard (The 4w5 aka “Pain”) is a 4 (dominate) when 4’s go into direction of disintegration they become a 2, and therefore they “cling to the very people that played them” (which is pathetic really).  (And no that doesn’t apply to me, well simply because I’m unique)   Oh and also another thing is.  (And I said this before)  I know the ESTP (my enemy) helps me and all. (Well because my dad confirmed it before) when he posted something like  “the ISTJ is helping him”  (back then when everything was blurry)  But my point is, the ESTP (my enemy) is helping me on his own free will, I never asked for help from him and I don’t need help from him.  (My point is, they are ALL my enemies for life no matter what, and therefore enemies of all my 100% loyal family (dad, therapist)   (And that goes without saying for my wife the ESTJ 14 Asian since she’s my wife and she’s 100% mine and agrees with me on everything) And just to (to recap)  About the ESTJ 14 Asian (my wife) “When I say that I love her (her and only her) and that I’m going to be loyal/committed to her  (her and only her) FOR LIFE.“  (she is to me too)  I mean it 100% absolutely, it is what I have chosen to do with my life, and will die happy knowing that I did.   Oh and also sex is ABSOLUTELY not important to me AT ALL.  And yeah, so I just wanted to let all my 100% loyal family know this.   To (all my 100% loyal family) Thanks for reading!
Team chocolate baby!! Wooo hooo!!
Team chocolate!!!
But chai has so much fat !
LOVE your video!! Thank you so much! Where did you buy the containers? I love how they are perfect size for a pudding or a yogurt parfait!!
What kind of coconut milk?  Canned or in a carton?
I'm thinking of doing a chocolate and peanut butter chi pud with cashew milk. But i gotta try it with coconut milk first.
Strawberry and banana yum...
Are these chia seeds the same seeds you use to make a chia pet or is this what you feed your chia pet after the pottery grows?
Chocolate 🍫
Love your recipes.
All of them
Vanilla and choclate!! Do you have a recipe for pistachio pudding??!!
Probably the chocolate! But they all look great!
I'm going to try the Chocolate chia pudding!!! TEAM CHOCOLATE!! ;)
Trying your base recipe with 1 Tbs Golden Milk (tumeric, herbs and dates by Gaia Herbs)
I use a chocolate bone broth protein powder for my chocolate chia seed pudding. Add bananas or a dollop of peanut butter
Healthy food 👍
Definitely make it with a fatty milk and you'll do your liver good!
The amount of matcha you used in the video was 1 tbsp, def not a teaspoon
Chocolate
Yuuuummy!!    Never had it but now i will soon .   Thanks!  Ps: you have nice looking skin :) sure this helps a bit :)
Thankyou for sharing this recipe. Will be trying some of these.
Can I use Basil seeds instead of chia seeds
Bonjour  Je n’ai rien compris mais les images était clair merci bcp  J’aime bcp les préparations 👍
That's a new idea.
Chocolate
This looks good!!
Macha 101 please
Chia
How do you stop it setting on the bottom
I like each one, good job 😍
All look delicious with lol need to try.
I usually make the chocolate chia pudding, but I like to add some powdered peanut butter to it...yum!
Haunt see you for ling time
so far I've made it with blueberries and with chocolate. BUT. I've used a combination of the two milks mentioned and I use the really dark chocolate powder! Sometimes I do add a nut butter, or some ground nuts and seeds for extra punch.
First try- Chocolate! Always Chocolate!😋
Where can you find matcha powder?
I tried this and I love it. Thank you
What do you have as the topping for the chocolate chia. Raspberries and ?? Coconut?
These look good!
Chocolate with coconut milk and shredded coconut
I would like the matcha...
Hi (to all my 100% loyal family)  Well first off, I just wanna let all of my 100% loyal family know that I’m doing great. (Also, just keep working on my job/everything Boston related and etc.......) (Also, I got the message about my therapist, and him being 100% loyal and everything)   Anyhow, this is the main topic for this post.  Ok so about the ESTJ 14 Asian   Ok so as of right now I have no idea what the fuck is going on as of right now  (having to do with to my “confirmation” about her and how I don’t want her to have ANY male friends/acquaintances on her phone / or anywhere else. (Well besides my 3 100% loyal dad/brothers)   (I want to know her response, but it doesn’t have to be ASAP. I can wait until actual contact and how I see her phone screen) (OR it can be ANY time my 100% loyal family thinks is an “appropriate time”)  Anyhow so here’s the thing. I just want to let all my 100% loyal family know that.  In order for “the relationship to work”  (between me and the ESTJ Asian 14) here are the conditions.  1. She has to be a virgin (And again this isn’t about me taking her virginity or anything, it’s about the “perfect vibe/true love” and how I explained everything before)   2. She has to agree to (EVERYTHING) I say. (This is just “proof of love/I’m the one and only most important person in her life”)  (And of course she’s the “one and only most important person in my life” that goes without saying)   (So that means SHE the ESTJ 14 Asian. Has to agree with EVERYTHING I SAY) (And that’s because  “Everything I say, “is and will” always be “for the better of the relationship”)  3. I want to know that even if she  “did agree to my no male friends/acquaintances” rule  What was her first “initial thought/response/overall mindset” Did she even have a “2nd thought about it?” Or did she just “happily agreed”. Because if she did not “happily agreed” then.........  (well let’s just say, let me know about this too, and I’ll take this into consideration)   And another thing is.  Like I said, in the beginning of this post. “Right now I’m feeling really good”.  It’s because I’m in the “state of equanimity” (aka the 4’s virtue “emotional balance”)  and I want to stay that way (for now)   (Also, I listed the  “conditions for the relationship with the ESTJ 14 Asian” to work. I want to let all my 100% loyal family know that that’s what I want)  (and then we can bring all of that up during “first person to person contact” because technically we’re already in contact just not person to person )  (OR ANY time my 100% loyal family thinks is an “appropriate time”.)  And also, another thing is , even though I am in the “state of equanimity” I still want to let the ESTJ 14 know that IF this relationship does work out then, well yeah everything I said still applies (well it always did apply, well unless the relationship doesn’t work out) but just saying.   “And everything else I said (to recap)  “When I say that I love her (her and only her) and that I’m going to be loyal/committed to her  (her and only her) FOR LIFE.“  (she is to me too)  I mean it 100% absolutely, it is what I have chosen to do with my life, and will die happy knowing that I did.   Oh and also sex is ABSOLUTELY not important to me AT ALL.  And ok, I just wanted to let all my 100% loyal family know this.  To (all my 100% loyal family) Thanks for reading!
What kind of coconut milk are you using???
can't wait to try any one of them but first i must go shopping
hello. if I bring this outside for a packed lunch or snack. will it spoil after few hours not in fridge?
I love coconut milk chia pudding with some kind of sweetener and strawberries and bananas as a topping once its congealed.
Chocolate!
I made chia pudding breakfast pudding this morning. With cinnamon and mixed berries  very satisfying and delicious! Replacing my morning oatmeal. Delicious!  .
What about oatmeal milk?
600 calories per unit 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Seeing stuff like this gets me excited about healthy and clean eating and this is also proof that eating clean doesn't have to be boring and bland.
The matcha is always my fave!
How is these carb wise because they do look delicious 😋
Great recipes! Just substitute the honey for maple syrup and it's 100% vegan!  ;o)
This woman is an lier! Half a cup is so so much,and she gave wrong measurements
Chocolate 😊
New here..Gonna try choclate one..😋
Hi I am having trouble gouping up chia seeds with just milk. Does mixing non fat milk make a difference?
Way too excited to try mine with my matcha powder (i just got them from next to Darjeeling in India) xD
Can we used toned milk instead of coconut milk??
try to freeze it then blend it with the hand blender and you will have the best icecream ever
Too bad. I'm not fan of pudding. What else can we put chia onto?
Great great video. What size are those mason jars?
I'm going to try all of them.  Thank you.
My friend is not allowed to have any kind of seeds, b/c she had surgery on her intestine. Did anybody try to blend the Chia pudding to break up the seedy texture? 🤔
Apple, cinnamon with a vanilla flavored milk has a apple pie and ice cream taste to it.
They looked so yummy I clicked instantly lol
They all look wonderful, going to definitely make them all!  Thanks for sharing!!!
I like the chocolate as well as the strawberry banana chia pudding
I love matcha tea and I have ir daily during office hours.  I also love full fat coconut milk, so can I use coconut milk with all if them?
Thumbs up!  Didnt realise that its so easy.  Thanks Dani.
Looks great. I'm going to try it.
I liked the video without watching it just because these look so good and so creative yum 😋
Macha
Matcha! So delicious 😋
I have made a few...but the texture is what gets me. But i am willing to try it again with these recipes.
Thank you 😘
I should really try different flavors.   I always do nuts tihini dates and seeds
I just bought matcha and taro powder online. For the meantime i just use the base and topped off with fresh banana, granola and berries.
Are they keto friendly??
Chocolate with almond milk and chia seeds
love it! started keto last month and I eat this for breakfast every morning.. can you give me some easy keto lunch prep ideas for work... not salad.. something warm... salad I usually do for dinner... plzz...preferably chicken..or vegetables..i don't eat any other meats
Can I added a extra spoon of stevia???
Try incorporating hilatï and sweet concentrated milk in there.let me know
Chia seed is also tukhmalanga
is coconut milk not as healthy?
I've been incorporating raw for over 10 years, and am FINALLY trying raw chia pudding!  LOVED the chocolate, and also did a mango/banana one.  Outta this world!  Why did I wait so long to make these?!?  I also substituted the maple syrup with coconut sugar.
The strawberries and banana sounds great to me.
Also is maple syrup ok to use in keto diet
How many carbs are there in each mason jar
matcha!
So you are saying that if I want it a little thicker I should use full fat milk or full fat coconut milk?  Just want to be clear because I like thicker puddings....my favorite is the Matcha tea flavor.
I have to try this!! Thank you!!   Any recipes for hemp seeds??   I make a snack bar... but I’d like to add more hemp to my diet 🙏😘
Looove love each of these😍😍😍😍🥰
I do a blueberry, but would love all of these will have to try them, thank you !!
They all look delicious to me, look forward to trying all four!
Wow love them all, nice new ideas for breakfast
Matcha and chocolate
Matchaaaaa
Very nice recipes
Thank you for your videos they are awesome. I will definitely try all of them and I'm me and my daughter will love them. ❤️
Make all 4 and decide later after eating all of them.
I plan to try chocolate and Macha.
You got me when you said, ''similar to tapioca pudding''. That's a pudding I really miss. Not anymore though thanks to your recipes.
I think I'm going to try the chocolate one tomorrow! They all look so good!
I would try making the base recipe or the chocolate recipe 1st, but that's only because I have the ingredients for those on hand already! But they all sound wonderful and I'm sure I will try making them all, thank you for these great recipes!
They also get lodged into your gut and cause inflammation and possibly infection. Don’t believe the hype!
Macha macha macha 😊
i made black chia seed with full fat coconut milk and real vanilla...as a breakfast i added that to plain greek yogurt and a dollop of homemade preserves for flavour.
thank for your tips
My mum taught me a chia seed seed pudding recipe   1 cup of soya chocolate milk   4 tablespoons of chia seeds   1 teaspoon of Hemp seed  Maple syrup   Leave it over night and it’s THE BEST
You are amazing 🙏🤗😘❤️
If you grind the chia seeds at will it still thicken the pudding?
Yes I used 1 cup so I am going to but pint jars.  I used cashew.  Good but liquidity. Thanks.
Ok I made it but it was still too much liquid. They were good I drank them. I think I put to much liquid.
You have beautiful glowing skin 👍
I love chocolate
Coco for chocolate. I love using dark cocoa powder.
Silk cashew unsweetened, erythritol, , coconut flakes, chia seeds., vanilla.  I will let you know.
I just added cinnamom, cashew PB FIT chocolate. I will let you know how it turns out.
i made this and let me tell you guys it was BOMB 🤤
i will try the chocolat and the banana strawberry, looks yumm
I love your recipes❤side note with love it's creamier not more creamy. I do thank you for your recipes i love the chocolate and i think your amazing.
Chocolateeee, yes.
I'm making chia pudding with mango yogurt milk. Can't wait to eat my chia pudding for my breakfast tomorrow! 😊
i almost vomit on her presentation, so pushy and unplesant ...
Hey Dani, what would happen if you used ground chia?
Made the regular one, the chocolate one and the matcha one. Chocolate wins 😋
Thanks.  Chocolate for sure.  Making right now :)
I m telling you this is happening tonight.
Love to make the choc pudding but to many carbs
I tried the recipe with full fat coconut milk (from a can) and the pudding came out really THICK. Do I leave it out a bit before eating it?  It doesn’t have a jelly like consistency...  Does storing it in a glass jar make a difference? I stored mine in small plastic containers.
I’d love some more Matcha recipes❤️
I want to try it but I’m worried it will be gross
Just made all 4 and put them in the fridge. Can wait to see which I’ll like best
Sooooooo yummy and delicious!
Does anyone know if the mason jar is 4 or 8oz ?
If I have unopened jars of chia seeds that have an expiration of 2017, can I still use them?
hi. .I tried this recipe. .the consistency of the pudding was very watery. . 1/2 cup of low fat milk + 2 table spoon of chia seed and honey + cinnamon. not sure what when wrong
Matcha i want more yammi rcps
Stevia
Can I use powder Stevie instead of liquid sweetner
I wanna like it but I can't get over the texture of chia pudding. I gag every time I try it 😩
Great video, new subbie
Love clean and delicious and simple meal choices.  I have your book and love your videos. Your Awesome💚🙏
I wonder if you could use spirulina instead of matcha. I've used it in my banana and almond smoothies and it tastes great!
try using kefir milk
I love matcha so matcha chia has been my favourite brekkie jar for years <3 loved your ideas xxx
Can you do any of these with rice milk too?
Grab a macha latte at Starbucks with a little sweetener my fav drink
Chocolate with mint
You could use dragon fruit powder. It would be so pretty, hot pink.
What if I just put for around 1 and half hour
Strawberries and bananas
Chocolate and macha
My favorite is Pina Colada 🥥 🍍🍹 I add a couple of drops of imitation coconut extract though
thanks so much
That matcha coconut chia pudding looks to die for!
Matcha woyld be bitter without  any sweetner..my fav would be mango pulp and cardamom..yum and I liked chai  chia of yours:)
Will know what to do after watching this..dont like it when anyone say..I want you to hit the like button or Iwant you to subscribe. Sounds kind of demanding. ☹
These look amazing! Thank you so much! An idea...the chocolate one with coconut milk and almond extract & coconut flakes for an Almond Joy flavor. 💖
Where can we find these kind of jars, they are really good!
Delicious, sure, healthy... not really: too much carbohydrate and glucose. Healthier that a traditional chocolate cake, well maybe, but not by much.
That's a lot of matcha
Chocolate
Black Chia seeds probably have more anthocyanins--a good thing.
love this, thank you
Chia pudding is not that tasty. I really think most people eat it because they think it’s healthy.
Chocolate with coconut milk and strawberry banana!  I love your receipts and personality Dani! Bless you and your family and your channel!
Am gonna start with the chocolate 😋😋😋
My puddings never last in the fridge 4 days, more like 4 minutes 🤣
I am addicted to chia 😍
Matcha!
Recipe starts at 1:24
Can I use normal cows milk?
I will try the cocoa one first
I quite like chia pudding but want to tinker with recipe.
Can I use honey instead of maple syrup?
I hit Like btn right away because  you tricked me lol
i‘ve been trying a chia pudding now for the third time and now i‘m trying your recipy. If it doesn’t work could you maybe tell me why. I don’t know if it’s the type of chia that doesn’t work or if i shouldn’t put it in the fridge. Could you please help me?
i followed your basic recepie with soy milk and left it overnight and the pudding didn't set. i added another table spoon of chia and hopefully it will be better though i doubt it because the texture is very runny
is this keto friendly
I love Oatmeal for breakfast, but I am diabetic and that makes have sugar spikes. Do you think Chia Pudding is a better option for me? Thanks!
Hi, do i have to use the honey/sweetner?
W
Matcha and chocolate 👍❤️
I mix chocolate and banana with adding almond 😍 for tomorrow breakfast😍🍜
Is no one gonna talk about how incredibly bad for you chia seeds are? Not to mention dangerous? Shame on you.
I purchased the 4oz jars in the link but they say regular mouth on the packaging.  I don’t see an option for wide mouth on amazon.  Did I get the wrong jars?
I’m definitely going to try the first one
I have been wanting to learn how to incorporate chia seeds into foods! Thanks!
Matcha 💚
can you lose weight with these puddings ?
Chia seeds are quite high in fat.  I am trying to lose weight, so I'm not sure I should eat me, although I do like the idea of make-ahead breakfasts that can be eaten on the go.  Right now I am into my oatmeal sweetened with apple sauce for breakfast.
I think a flavor combo that I would love to try would be chocolate cherry chia pudding!
I like to grind up the chia seeds, it makes the pudding so much creamier!:)))
I want to try  them all
I am going to try the chocolate and the fruit one first. Have you thought of putting strawberries in the chocolate one when you take it out of fridge. #valentinesdaybreakfast
I use almond milk and greek yogurt with fruits 😍 its  delicious. I need to try it with coconut milk and matcha flavor
How about a Mexican hot choc flavor? Cinnamon, cayenne, and some candied jalapeño?
Thank you for these great recipes. Can't wait to try them!  I'm from Hawaii, so would suggest haupia as a good additional flavor to try . . . a takeoff from the popular Hawaiian dessert haupia pudding.
Hi Dani, thank you for this recipe, I have made this a bunch of times. If I wanted to change it up, could I mix oats in to this?
I tried to make some yesterday and left it in the fridge overnight and it turned out clumpy and nothing like what I get from the store or what I see here.
Also can we use yogurt as base?
Can we use normal cow milk
bAAloooo berries
I think you need to talk less and show more.. after watching your video for 2:30 mins I just paused it and gave you a thumbs down.
Matcha + coconut! Some mango with it might good too 😊
Has anyone used chocolate protein powder instead for the chocolate version?
Thank you for sharing.. just bought 1kg of chia seeds and clueless on what to apart from adding them up in the water. Hahaha.
I made one yesterday. I used almond milk and 2tbs of chia seeds and left it in a fridge overnight. It was still liquid and didn’t have the pudding consistency :( what did i do wrong?
Chocolate!! I just went and mix it up for tomorrow morning cant wait to try it!😁
You are so pretty
I’m here for the health but this woman is extremely sneaky hot I’ll be back for more !!!!
In going to try the chocolate one!
Mine says 3 tablespoons for 5 grams of protein.
Coconut
I use 1tblspn chia + 1 cup almond milk I make myself.. When ready to eat, I add a mix of nuts & seeds I've soaked (throw away the water) + 1tblspn hemp seeds + 2 tblspn blueberries or raspberries. Sometimes I add a tblspn of plain unsweetened coconut yogurt or a tspn of oats.  I don't use maple syrup or honey as its sweet enough and I'm Type 2 Diabetic. It's great to make a batch in about 3 lidded glass bowls so there's always a go-to snack or substitute meal available.
Can i make it with full fat cow milk
These all look soooo good! I really want to try them all. Great video
Great  video !  Will want to try chocolate with coconut milk !  Should the seeds be ground for better absorption and nutrition ?  Thank you !
Hi Danny, don't you have to soak the chia seed first, say a few hours, before you mix them in the pudding for breakfast? I was told chia seed need to be soaked in water, preferably overnight so that it would turn glutenuous then you mix with fruits or milk.
Made a carrot cake one with shredded carrots, coconut and walnuts that is really good with lots of texture 😋
Had to hit like ‘cause that ask was so cute 😝
I prefer the tapioca like flavor of adding 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract.
Just a little warning ... when you start eating chia pudding it's rapidly becoming an obsession haha !
Mine went solid
hi,i want to try these chia puddings but im diabetic..do these puddings have carbs n if so how many carbs..i know u mention i can add stevia sugar but i just need to know about how many carbs they contain so that i know i can eat them..they look very yummy to me..im just worried of carbs..please help with my question..thanks
Nice vid.  Could have done without the awkward  though lol
Any clue if you can use grounded chia seeds? Really wanna give it a shot but that’s all I have at the moment
Oh yes definitely what I have been searching for.  Want them all, of course chocolate is top of the list.  Who doesn't want chocolate?!  :)  I like the sound of the cinnamon one, but instead of raisins I will probably use cran-raisins, since I am not a great fan of raisins.  Probably will add a sprinkle of Ginger to it also.  I will be starting on this great bunch of pudding ideas first thing in the morning.  Thank you so much.
I adore anything matcha, but that stuff is insanely expensive just for a small jar of it. I usually do my chia puddings with yoghurt :)
Chocolate
Where did you buy your matcha powder? Thanks for sharing this amazing treats❤️
Love this video, Thankyou!
I swear I just love this beautiful lady......All her recipes are GREAT!!!!!
Looks yum! would love to try and post on my channel too! ❤️
yes! matcha101 for sure
I ran into this cause I forgot yogurt today for overnight oats. I'm crossing my fingers my man loves this in the morning. Ty for sharing xoxo
Strawberry and bananas...yummy
I caught the chia habit over 7 years ago.  I make a yummy lime drink with them.  As well as throwing them into smoothies, oatmeal and pancakes. Going to try the chocolate pudding.  Since most of the carbs are fiber, they are great on Keto-   Will try with stevia for sweetener-
I'm making the matcha one right now for breakfast tomorrow!
deliciousness! i love chocolate and matcha! i usually blend up almond milk with banana and add a tablespoon of cocoa powder and a tablespoon of molasses. i just ordered some organic matcha powder and i wanna make this matcha mung bean paste with red bean filling wrapped in mochi.
Instead of maple syrup can I put raw honey?
They all look delicious. I haven't made chia pudding yet. I have put chia in my iced coffee, that was really good. I use almond milk, and maple syrup to sweeten it.
Chocolate
Hi!!!! New subscriber here!!! Just bought some chia seeds and didn't know what to do with them!! Just heard how good they are for you. So....... It will be chocolate for me!!!!!    Mo, Lincs, UK XXX
So glad I found your channel. I love all of the information you supply and you’re so well spoken. Very informative and enjoyable 😊
I love coconut so I will try that one. thanks.
she blinked so much
Just subscribed and on my way to the grocery store! Can you use plastic containers or ceramic bowl (mini soufflé bowls) and cover with plastic wraps?
Yammy recipe#nooralishba's cooking
Which Maple Syrup would you recommend?
Can i use water instead of milk?
Does anyone know for how long will the pudding stay good in the fridge
I think I'll be trying the chocolate one tomorrow!! It looks suuuuper yummy
great video !     job well done !
2:52 my heart
My seeds always sink to the bottom. How do I stop that from happening?
Macha tastes a bit like ummmm...dirt. yep dirt.
Cool
Chocolate
Matcha Pudding 😋
Chocolate & matcha
I have chia pudding every morning mixed with fruit and a tablespoon of maple oatmeal.  My weightloss is amazing .  Other diets plateaued,   but this one is a keeper and you feel full afterwards.
Make sure to drink plenty of water after eating Chia seeds. It absorbs a lot of water.
Can i use regular milk with honey in pregnancy
Yummy!  I'll make them all!
I love chia pudding...never had it until I saw your recipe.  I like the plain chia as you make it with almond butter and banana on top.  Yum!
Just made all chocolate chia puddings! 4 hours can’t come soon enough!! But while I am waiting I am enjoying your turkey chilli recipe - so uhmazing.
super tasty! but is this enough for breakfast :-? (just asking)
the chocolate on looks sooo good. my question. I have never had chia seeds and because I am just newly  trying to be vegan would this give me a lot of painfull gas?
Can you use normal dairy milk?
I am currently making the chocolate chia pudding, I added a little bit of salt and going to add raspberries. :) Thanks for the idea!
As far as I know, you're not supposed to have more than 1 tablespoon of chia seeds
First one I tried was the chocolate and I liked it so much I haven’t made any of the rest (I will at some point). Thank you!
Thank you so much and God bless you always beautiful
I tried the Chocolate Chia pot today. OMG it was delicious. Looking forward to trying the others as well. Thank you so much.
Bitch 4 hours, I leave mine in the fridge for 10 mins and devour that shit
Yum! Fresh and healthy 👌will try thanks
definitely, the chocolate chia seed pudding but will a little twist I'm going to add the healthy vegan chocolate truffles that I made before yesterday from scratch i am  super duper excited
Love chia pudding will like to try match a💕😍
Matcha 101!!!🤩
Matcha
I will try all of them
Get some plastic lids for those jars, they are much more convenient than the 2-part metal ones.
Avocado chia pudding 😁 Your chai chia is wonderful. Hadn’t thought of that combo. And apple pie chia - grated fresh apple and cinnamon. Yum. But eat with in 2 days. Alternatively use apple sauce, but fresh is delicious.
Everytime i eat yougurt or pudding i feel like im eating sticky mud and getting suffocated..  i dont know why i even bother to watch this😆😆😆 looks yummy maybe
Can you cook choa seeds?
Yes i want a 101 on chia seeds
subscribed! ;) id like to try the strawberry banana and chocolate!
"Melk" or "Milk"?
I"m a newby when it comes to "chia." I'm not big on chocolate but, you make me want to try it so that's where I will start. Thanks for the video!!
The link to the 4oz wide mouth jars on amazon is actually regular mouth:/ and I dont think 4oz wide mouth mason jars exsist. You can only get wide mouth in 8oz only.. (doing a lot of research to find 4oz wides)  However, in your videos it looks like your using a wide mouth 8oz jar, correct? So the nutritional value  you have down for calories is that for a 4oz or 8oz jar? Thanks!
Matcha ❤️
Matcha 101 please
I want to try the strawberry 🍓 banana 🍌 chia pudding.
I was just thinking to make chia pudding, when I stumbled upon your videp...  Ohh and YES.... *PLease Definately DO A MATCHA 101 video.* Thank-you so much Dani.. your long followed fan.. ❤
I love maple chia pudding for breakfast. Yum
The look al delicious dr Colbert make it with papaya almond milk 🥛 is very good thank you I need to get all this ingredients 😊
#teamchocolate #teamfullfatcoconutmilk
I Like That You Stay on Topic and Don't Start Rambling About Other Things....it Makes it Nice  To Watch!!
I just started drinking Chia seeds, honey, lemon juice drink everyone morning since Tuesday  !!   Love it !!   I will definitely try these pudding recipes  !!!   ♡ ♡ ♡
I e been struggling to get enough kcal protein and fat into my diet as I'm a veggie... This is going to make all the difference!
this is suitable for breakfast?
Just made the chocolate one tonight with coconut milk. Cant wait to try it tomorrow
Has anyone tried to make chia seed pudding with yogurt?
I am using water instead of milk. To get the texture I add some cream cheese (about 4.5 g of fat per 100 g) and minced mango. If I want it to be sweeter, I add in half a banana.
Can I use cow milk?
Thank you so much for this video😚 you're absolutely the best with all the information you provided at the beginning 👌 I'll absolutely subscribe you're channel ☀☀
Have you tired pumpkin spiced chia pudding with pumpkin puree and pumpkin pie spice
I tried this with coconut milk, honey, and a teaspoon of instant coffee. It was yum! Next time I'll have to try chocolate or perhaps combine the two and make coconut mocha chia pudding!
Banana and strawberry I think, but the chocolate looks good too with the coconut cream
Making the chocolate chia pudding overnight trying it tomorrow! Super excited and putting strawberrries on top!
I am from germany and we do not use cups. Can someone help me?
Chocolate
Do you have to have a sweetener?
Does anyone know exactly where to purchase the 4oz wide mouth jars from? I see in the description box there is a link to amazon but it only carries the regular mouth 4 oz jars.  I have found the wide mouth jars but they are 8 oz. will this work?
I discovered chia pudding by accident, or maybe it was desperation.  I had some strawberry kefir and although I liked the flavor, I couldn't force myself to drink something so thick. It was so thick, it kind of made me want to gag. I knew chia seeds gel in liquid, so mixed some into a small container of the kefir and let it sit in the refrigerator. Yummy. Now I want some.
it's the same quinoa or not
That's yummy ❤️
My Irish friend Naomi Ní Chatháin makes the most beautiful ones, worth the look. She is on Instagram. But yours look great too. Nice video.
Can I use ground chia?
Chia seeds make your shit hard so with these you won't shit for like... 3 years.
I ate the chaï chia pudding this morning. Delicious! My new favorite I think.
Is it okay to use the usual fresh or non-fat milk or like soya milk to go with the chia seeds?🤔
I made the chocolate pudding I love chocolate but I didn’t really like it idk why thi
Chocolate and coconut
Omg so simple! Mind blown 🤯
I don’t think these portions are right if you use coconut milk. I tried this Sunday night and the pudding did not set up following your recipe.
Thank you!!! I love this recipe.  Yum
Today I tried the Chia pudding and I was disgusted, I didn't like it. The texture was so weird and I wanna throw up, I couldn't eat it
U
Am i the only one who spells chia seeds as kia seeds?
"Matcha is kinda like a plant...based flavor." matcha...is from a plant...
you blink a lot man. i still love you tho
Is it good for weight loss program
Can I do just chia and milk of choice let it sit for hours and then put the powders like cocoa and match in it in the morning. I am thinking of doing it that way so I can dress it up the way I want when I am ready to eat it.
Great recepie!!! Thanks for sharing!!
I will try them all. The choc one I will add banana and strawberry
I WILL TRY THE CHOCOLATE ONE WITH FULL COCONUT MILK. THEY ALL LOOK DELICIOUS. THANKS  FOR THE RECIPES.
the thumbnail made me think this was a slime video
you TALK too much darling JUST do it so fast PLEASE
organic marsha green chia seed pudding
I would try the strawberry and banna chia pudding.
I like chia pudding, but the closest description of the texture I can think of is frog spawn
I can use normal milk?
I couldn’t watch the video cause her intonation really got on my nerves guess we’ll never know
obsessed with chia!!!! its the best and so easy!
Great vids. subbed
Just mixed the chocolate pudding. Will try tomorrow morning. I am a chocolate team member as well :) WooHoo for Chocolate .
I make one with strawberry and chocolate chips
Bravo*
3:47
I like the strawberry and banana chia seed pudding
I would try the Chia then the chocolate and then the other two💕☺👍👍✌
Thank u for Jesse recipes they look amazing I can’t wait sit to try all
GREETINGS, I LOVE YOUR VEGAN RECIPES. AND I TRULY APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU TAKE TIME TO INCLUDE THE RECIPE IN THE WRITTEN SECTION, THIS SAVES OUR TIME WHENEVER WE WANT TO DO THE RECIPE. ☺😚 BLESSIMGS ✌💚
Thank you, my son has a dairy allergy. This is perfect to replace. Going to try as soon as I can.
Can you use regular milk?
Basic chia seed pudding with coconut and fresh mango!! It’s really good
I am sorry......., I just bought some chia seeds.....and I hate chia pudding!! I flavoured mine with cinnamon and banana........and it was disgusting!!! It looks, tastes and feels kind of......grey! Urgh. I must be missing something 😄
Thank you for the recipes
matcha and chocolate
If you don't like the slight crunch of the Chia seed then blend the Chia up into a Chia flour before mix in it with the other ingredients.
could I just skip the maple syrup?
👍🌹😉
Matcha and Chai☺ .....BTW.....LOOOOVE THE BLOOPERS😀😀😀
I discovered this summer I love fresh peaches and raspberry chia pudding. Yum!
Yum! All 4 sound wonderful!
Love these ideas. Thank you for sharing x
I use cacao powder in r e chocolate 🍫 x
Strawberry, banana chia and green chia. Thanx.
Matcha 101...I'll probably try the chocolate coconut version.
I love these I really enjoy eating them.  Very easy
Can somebody tells me is matcha supose to be so bitter? 😅
I made the chocolate chia pudding and it was extra wonderful! Thank you Dani for sharing this video.
Hello, please I want to know more about making chia pudding. Can I use almond milk with the chia seed?  Will be glad to see your reply. Thank you
Does matcha,contain caffeine?
Going to try chocolate banana!
I love the taste of chia puddings, but I absolutely hate the texture of the seeds
Chocolate Chia is so so yummy ! I would love a Matcha 101 video
Chocolate!
Matcha will feel lumpy when put like this. You should always dissolve it in water or milk and never use it as a dry ingredient for recipes like this
is it ok just to use regular milk?
Where is the chai in the chai chia pudding? #whitepeople #smh
Can these puddings be heated up?
I’m really excited cause I’ve just finished making it and can’t wait to see in the morning I did chocolate 🍫
Love all of them.... can't wait to try... love the bloopers...😁
Start recepie part at 1:20. Cant tell you how many times ive watched this and waited for the ingredient part alone
Thanks
Banana and chocolate
It can be stored for 3 days?
Hmmm...yeah...I should definitely add some matcha to chia pudding.  I've got tons of both.  That's easier than bothering with a matcha latte every day.  P.s. If you want chai to taste like chai, and not just "spiced," you need to add a little bit of garam masala and a pinch of black pepper.  That's what gives it that distinct "chai" flavor.
:” It difficult to describe, but if you ever had a cup of macha tea, then it tastes exactly like that”...
How about making it in soy milk ?
I want a pistachio type pudding. Any suggestions?
Why would anyone dislike this video? This is amazing!!! Thank you for sharing !!!!!! Love love love. And grateful!
👍😍👍
Definitely the Strawberry Banana!
My usual go-to is honey-vanilla with a sprinkle of cinnamon. (I usually only make it when I can get some raw milk though).
You cook like I do - yumm! And I even have friends named Spees.
I will definitely buy those ingredients asap ..
thanks for sharing these recipes😍
What size jars do you use?
god the texture looks so gross
Can we keep in room temperature overnight without refrigerating
Why are my chia seed not thickening or expanding  like a pudding?
where can i get similar container? where did you get? thank you for the video!
Well organized and to the point thank you!
I made the chai pudding first and had run out of maple syrup so substituted with honey. I made it with maple syrup today and it is definitely better that way, it' so yummy.
Thanks for this video. It inspired me to make Mango Chia pudding with dates as sweetener and almonds for that nutty flavour. Pl check out my instagram handle dipalivaidya. Thanks again!
i made a strawberry cinnamon pudding it was soooooooooooo good thank you for getting me the base its really solid thx
Actually they all sound great. Hard to pick
Pb2 powder is great too.
I've had matcha and all the chai spices sitting around and I never thought to make these flavor combos! I'm going to try all of them 😸
I've heard of chia pudding and liked the idea. I thought it was blended. It doesn't look appetizing in the video. And dialogue could be more concise. Peace.
Can u replace chia for hemp hearts?
Love your recipes!!!
Hi there, have you ever tried to mix the chia and any powder you like first and then add the liquid? it is a lot easier and you don't have to stir so much and the powder does not stick to the jar. :)     wish you all the best :)
Love making chia pudding
The chocolate one and the banana strawberry one are my top two. 👍🏻
WOW!!! So excited to try this👍you rock lady 😎
YUMMY, love the chocolate the best with raspberries.
Thanks for putting all of the nutrition info!
Matcha 101 please!!
"Team Chocolate"!
Another excuse to use cardamom! Yay!
Hi .. First I would like to tell you that I like your videos .. I'm border line desprite .. I have tryed so many times to loose weight and there are so many good people on youtube with great intentions and and yes great food preperations but sometimes it is so expensive or hard to find the ingredinces..most off not all are organic .. and  I thank you for being simple for someone like me .. a bit slow, in how you make and present you lovely creations and if you can perhaps and only if time permits could you do some foods that would help myself and maby others to get on tract to loosing a bit of weight .. and yes I know that, as I stated before there are other videos on youtube but I trust you .. thank you a fan
Coconut milk , my fav

How many tbsp is 1/2 cup of milk?
Hi there! :) I looove your videos! Just had to say that! I know this is an old video but is there something wrong with the sweeten almond milk?
I want to try the match next. I’ve made the chocolate with full fat coconut and I’ve made one with lime juice. All wonderful. I haven’t tried it with almond milk yet. Thanks so much.
can we make the chocolate one with chocolate almond milk directly?
Am i the only one that cringed when she put the whole spoon of matcha in at once cause how how bad matcha clumps if you dont add it a little at a time?
Can you please tell what size are your mason jars,Danny?like how many litres .because I want to order exactly that same size online.
matcha has caffeine !!!
Matcha 101
I'm going to try all of them!
Matcha 101 please! New sub❤️
Never had Matcha looks yummy, must try. Thanx girly
Doing this tonight! Thinking to use some of my homemade almond milk with some coconut milk plus banana and cinnamon then add walnuts in the morning!
I will try the chocolate first, but I will add Coconut flakes with it! Thanks a lot 🙂 I will eat it as a snack for when I crave sweet stuff 😺
Thanx, nice presentation....Might try some of this altho I never eat pudding or dessert....I have Chia in my breakfast smoothie with 20 to 30 other super foods. ...
I make vanilla chia pudding and chocolate with cashew milk.
Chocolate cherry!
Chocolate omg I can't wait to make it!!  TEAM CHOCOLATE all day...

I love the idea of all these pudding flavours, but I am going to try the coconut one first. Thank you for the recipes.
These look delicious :-)
It's actually recommended not to eat more than 1,5 table spoon of chia seeds per day
I just put a double batch of the chocolate pudding into the fridge. I'm excited to see what it tastes like when the four hours are up.  Thanks bunches for the recipe.
That which I found very good relating to metabolic cooking recipes compilation is it allowed so as that I really could quickly plan my daily meals and so work the prep time period into my personal frantic schedule. I am able to cook certain elements of the recipes early on to minimize the preparation work every time i was hard-pressed for the time. The electronic copy on my smart phone made selecting the active ingredients really easy and almost all those ingredients are straightforward to locate also typically lower priced. I looked but couldn't come across this sort of a really good number of excellent recipes like this anywhere. Read more at my blog site here http://bit.ly/2BmHeNz
3-4 days even with the fruit inside? Need to try them... They look delicious!
Thank you for the awesome recipes. I tried it with plain water and it tastes like dirt. Lol
Can I replace chia with flax?
Love chia pudding and chocolate with raspberry, the best! 🍓🥂, thanyou great recipes. 🖒
Do you still do weight loss work with clients??  I weigh 497 pounds and need your help. Your spiritual and nutritional attitudes and ideas mesh with mine so well. I need help to literally save my life. Weight loss surgery isn’t safe for me. I would love to work with you!!!
I didn't have Vanilla extract , so just used Light Vanilla Soy Milk + Honey. :). The Flavor was delicious.
Can we use soy milk?
Chocolate then strawberry banana.
Delicious! You’ve got a new subscriber 💕
I make the Chia Pudding with the base, and adding peanut butter, bananas, and coconut flakes for flavor.
This is Super Yumm!! and sooo easy to make! great recipe :)
Thanks!Your are beautiful.But you'd love to see those by Naomi Ní Chatháin, an Irish lass who is on Instagram and Facebook as Naomi Bakes :)
I made the pudding yesterday - it is so yummy!  I made one small change - added about a Tbsp of protein to each.
Matcha is a superfood.  1 8 ounce cup of matcha = 8 cups of green tea.   HIGH CAFFEINE LEVEL.  Great way to start your morning!
I'm new to the chia community and looking to control my insulin levels. I will try the chocolate pudding. I don't like the way it looks. Those seeds don't look appetizing. Can I use a chia powder instead? Which is better?
Can you use coe milk i am out of almond
Banana strawberry and apple walnut ...my personal favs
Im making chocolate rn!! First time makin this treat!
Love this video! Going to try these. Would love a Matcha 101 video :-)
i feel like the chocolate one would be bitter without sweetness .i will try to see.
Can't wait to try these!
Your video is 4 minutes too long.
I think I will try the chocolate chia pudding😋
Where can I buy chia seeds?
chia is def the best my teacher gave it to me today and now i am here XD
I'm calculating 40% fat on these recipes(according to the nutritional breakdown above). 30% is healthy. 20% is lean(fat loss).  Am I  calculating this correctly? Are these good for incorporating into a low fat eating plan? They'd be great for in between meals but don't want to sabotage myself.  I understand they are healthy but are they lean?
Wow so easy! Thx
Like the vanilla and chocolate.
Where did you purchase the containers from? I wanted to try the chocolate recipe😃
Amazing, thank you!
I like drinkable one, coconut milk, chia seeds, n oatmeal
I found with normal low fat milk bomb, I wonder how good with coconut milk be? Anyway tried the chocolate one so far. Love it
Can you use fat free milk instead?
Oops!  Looked again and understand the base has the maple syrup....so several are in the refrigerator!
I would have picked the chocolate but with all that coco powder there was nothing to sweeten it. I then would try the banana strawberry.  We were just talking this morning that we will never be able to use up all these little seeds.  I put them in cereal and to top my home made bread. Now I will try these!  Thanks.
I love all 4.
Can we use water
I will be making chocolate with coconut milk tonight. Thank you.
I'm going to try the strawberry and banana
Where can i get those little containers? For the chia puddin
Thanks Dani!
Chocolate!!
They all sound delicious to me!
If you put it in a blender it gets really thick and the seed part blends up. Texture like regular putting.
Way too much matcha in this recipe... consider half a tablespoon
Chaiiiiiiii
I love the chocolate flavor ❤️❤️
Ooh. Cashew milk could be so delicious in this!!!
I “liked” before watching.
I've never had chia.  Can you tell me what it taste like?
How many drops of stevia would u say?

Chocolate sounds good!

I love your recipes. I am new to clean eating. I am vegetarian! Is it possible to use regular milk? Also where to buy matcha powder?
Hello can you show me witch coconut milk is batter?
Could you please tell me what kind of raisins you use in these chia puddings...the raisins I have contain sulphur and that is a no no...thanks

Loved the Chocolate one!! So yummy!!!
Love the videos. To make these, do I need to refrigerate the chia seeds overnight first or the entire recipe? Thanks.

Definitely chocolate but i will add banana and walnut in mine coz i just love banana and walnut
You must love cinnamon lol

I have made the chocolate one in the past.  I love them all, so delicious, and healthy

I love them all, but I think I'm also team chocolate.
I LOVE this video, first for the fact that the ingredients and recipe are in the bio. Thank you so much!
First time making chia pudding! Trying out the matcha green one. ♥️
Freeze a peeled banana in a zip lock 1-2 days, then blend it with 2-3 tbs peanut butter and chocolate protein powder or cocoa powder, coconut milk and enjoy chocolate PB banana protein milkshake, or add chia n mix, then refrigerate overnight and enjoy chocolate PB banana protein pudding.
Can I make the berry one but without the berrys
So it can be any type of milk?
I’ve never tried Chia Pudding I’ve been seeing it for years, it’s Time I try it lol
Hi! How about using soya milk as the liquid of chia pudding? Will it taste good? Thanks!
For the match a recipe did you use unsweetened coconut shreds
Do you have to use a lid?
Chair then chocolate
I finally made a chocolate version of this last night and ate it this morning for the first time. How delicious! Mine came out more like a mousse, but delicious just the same.  These are now in my food prep rotation.
I have all kinds of matcha....thx for the inspiration!
I used ground Chia seeds instead Is there any difference. I thought it was delicious..
Starts at 1:18
Yes to matcha 101
Thanks!!!
I whipping up the chocolate chia pudding tonight, and I’m adding fresh blueberries to it in the morning.

Hi from Maui! Cool!!!!   What size mason jars were these???,...
Chocolate
My children don't like coconut or almond milk so can I use regular milk
Wish I could just copy n paste recipe
Excellent!
Bruh your only suppose to consume a spoon of chia per day
Instead of almond milk can I make it with the normal milk (dairy)?
I ran out of cocoa powder. I am thinking to try milo
Matcha 101 for sure.....
I appreciate if you please tell me
I wonder if chia seed pudding child safety
Can my 5 year old eat too he wants to try when I am eating can he eat as well
Hello, I wanted to let you know I'd try the chocolate chia seed pudding. I used carob powder instead of cocoa powder because I'm allergic to chocolate. It was good. I should have doubled the recipe. I'm repeating tonight. thank you!!
Can you use regular milk?
I just made the chocolate one for tomorrow morning! I love chia pudding, got to try your other recipes ;)
all of them
also favs matcha and chocolate big thumbs up
what is that creamy white thing on chocolate chia topping
Wow! You weren't kidding about the coconut milk with this recipe! The bomb! Added a few strawberry chunks and relish! Thank you, thank you for this recipe! I can tell it's gonna be one of my favs! PS My husband really loves the cucumber salad!👍
Matcha 101 please
Clean & Delicious is it okay to use sweetened cocoa powder for the chocolate chia pudding
I wanted to thank you Dani, because for the first time in forever, I have experimented with a new food (new to me at least) and have loved it. I first tried chia seeds years ago, but I didn't like them, probably because I didn't really know how to use them. Yesterday night I tried preparing a jar of the chocolate version you show in this video, very simple, lactose-free milk because it's what we have, chia, cocoa powder, a teaspoon of honey. This morning I woke up late because real life happens, and I managed to have a healthy, quick, DELICIOUS breakfast thanks to this recipe!! Plus the fact that you have to prepare it the night before is a guarantee that I get to eat breakfast, because mornings are very difficult. I am so glad that now I have a solution for those morning I have to wake up super early, so that I have less of an excuse to turn to the café right next to my office and have myself a delicious but not so clean croissant. So thank you, really!
I can't wait to try it Yum Yum Yum 👅 hank you thank you thank you🙏😍😊🙏🍒🍇
These look amazing.  Thanks!  I'm going nutrient dense, anti-inflammatory diet and that means no dairy, grains, legumes, sugars, seed oils or processed foods.  So, that being said, I'm looking for ways to rev up what I can eat with new ways to prepare them.  Thank you, again for posting this video.  I will use my almond milk AND my coconut milk beverage for a breakfast porridge type pudding and I'll use my coconut milk (full fat) for a dessert type pudding.  :D
Seems that EVERY health YouTuber needs to have a chia pudding video 🙄
Thank you! Love your video 😘
Matcha for sure....thanks for sharing
Probably matcha.
I'm new to these healthy ideas. Looking for more ideas. I started with your video and it truly helped. Can't wait to try these four!
WILL TRY THE CHOCOLATE IST THEN MATCH WHICH KIND DID YOU BUY ?
What other flavors go well with matcha?
Hi..can I use regular dairy milk for this?
Can you grind the chia seeds first or does it only work when they're whole? I'm not the biggest fan of lumpy pudding
Perds le poids rapidement avec les graines de chia Lose weight fast with chia seeds https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4iyrJZYdfM
oh and i have a q plz.  is there an exact  amount to use them everyday? or i can use them anytime any amount?????
iam new to chia seeds today my first day using them.so ur video is a help. thanks
Gotta go with chocolate Dani!
I can always count on you to educate myself about "clean and delicious food"!!! It is quite hard to eat a certain way here bere in Italy, where eating is a phylosophy of life (and so is choosing butter and oil over, say, avocado oil). I love the traditional recipes for a treat once or twice a week but I can't think of maintaining a healty body without having options. I have steered clear of chia seeds because I had little information on them, and I couldn' t find any sources I trusted, but Now with this in my hands... ❤
Those look delicious! Do you think you can add whey protein powder to the recipe?
I'm trying the chocolate pudding for the first time tonight for dessert!
I tried doing it just with some almond milk and honey I left it in the fridge overnight to have it for breakfast but the chia seeds didn't do anything 😣 idk if I did something wrong... they stayed the same
I would like to learn about matcha. Does it have caffeine?
I'm going to try your chocolate chia pudding and the strawberry banana one.
I'm going to try the chocolate one now
Hmm, delicious, I love them all. TFS,  even though those jellied seed clusters set off my trypophobia,  I shall bravely try all your Chia pudding flavors. :)
You can also add some glucosamine to help make it thicker.
Just made and waiting for the morning to try it! Thanks for your recipes.
I recently found your page. It's been life changing for me! I was diagnosed with Candida overgrowth, it's been a huge challenge, especially because I rarely cooked before this and when I did it was never amazing! I had about 4 recipes that I could do mediocre, spaghetti, Ramen, Baked potatoes and scrambled eggs. I found your page looking for cauliflower pizza. I was able to change it enough to fit my dietary needs, and it was amaaaaazinggggggggg, and I was changed. Since then I have been watching all of your videos, and modifying the ones I can and saving the ones I can't for when I get to have a somewhat normal life again! I plan on being a clean eater for the rest of my life and finding your page made me realize not only is it possible, but it's DELICIOUS! \o/ Thank you :) PS I just made my first batch of Chia Pudding and I am really excited to try it :D
Hello pretty hope it help in weight loss? Am strugglin to loose kg ..got large appetite.
Is this vegan?
I seem to have acquired 2 pounds of Chia seeds...and headed over here.....because i love pudding, and need ideas. Thank you for your video, I am no longer in panic mode!
They look super delicious!! Can't wait to try them soon. One question, why doesn't the chai pudding have any tea in it?
Hi Dani, I just subscribe to your channel and would like to make these  puddings, but they are high in carbs n sugars , I'm diabetic any suggestions to lower the carbs?
Yes to Matcha 101
I just made the chocolate one, and it was amazing!!!
My local coffee shop tops the base recipe with maple syrup, blueberries, banana slices, and sliced almonds. It's really good, but I'm excited to try the chai and strawberry banana recipes you showed.
Matcha 101 all the way!!!!!
i happen to have coconut almond milk at home right now .. I wonder how it it will come out 🤔 guess I'll try now
Milk does NOT have calcium.    Use broccoli, that chia has more calcium.
You should cook the seeds first to guard against any bacterial contamination.
I made the chocolate and it was great thank you! But how many servings are in each recipe? Thanks
The mason jars look so cute 😍
matcha!
Would love a matcha 101
I would do the chocolate with coconut milk but break up Skippy peanut butter balls all in it!
Too gud.    Your lip colour is too nice and it suit you.  Keep smiling. God bless
Looks good
Team chocolate. I could be captain of that team. I'm going to make apple pecan and add some hemp hearts.
Macha
can I just use normal milk?
Chia pudding yum!!!😋😋
can i use soy milk?
Great !
Amazing 😉  Love ❤️ it" Good 😊 job...
can i use soy milk instead of almond milk? thanks :)
I have chia powder, is it gonna work on this too? Thx, subs here.

I want to try all this recipes but my mom doesn't want to buy the ingredients

This is really delicious...love it
Matcha! I am obsessed with matcha!
Sounds so good and I am going to try this ASAP.  I love the chocolate and the strawberry banana sounds good too.  Can't wait to get to the store.  Thank you!
plz mention calories
How long will they keep in the fridge?
CHOCOLATE, I stopped the video midway and have two chocolate pudding in the fridge right now......oh yeah 😛🐢
Thanks so much!
Matcha
Does it need to be in glass jars?
Going to try Matcha Coconut first
When i got them my mom said they look like lice but in spanish 😂😂😂
Can you make it with whole milk??
Finally I got a perfect recipe to make with Chia seeds......but may I know whether can I use dairy milk instead of non dairy milk
I enjoy your creative recipes, your great energy, and your helpful info!!!  Thank you for the information, and YES, more matcha stuff please :) God bless you!
This looks amazing!! I want to try the banana and chocolate one!!
The honey/ syrup/ sugar can be avoided completely if you add a banana to the base. Makes for a healthier version
Delicious...
These look really delicious.. Amazing presentation:*..
Has anyone tried the pudding using soy milk? I'm wondering if it will be alright.
Do you need to use jars?
Macha 101
Hey! Does the milk need to be almond or coconut? Or can we use cow milk?
Can we do it with out glass Mason jar
Hi there, I have just started watching your channel and find it very interesting. I'm in my 50"s and finding it very hard to loose weight even though I do some exercise. So, I've decided to start clean eating. Yesterday I went and bought some chia seeds and made a breakfast with them this morning, I was so surprised I actually liked them. As you saw as bit like tapioca. Thank you, your new subscriber x
I feel like I shouldn't ask this, since no one has mentioned cow's milk in the comments, so there's probably some unspoken rule about it, but, is it bad to use cow's milk? Coconut milk is kinda insanely expensive.
excuse me are'nt you have to cook chai first because it a grain ?
Amazing, thanks!!
I didn't have strawberries so I made a banana and shredded  coconut one :3 in four hours ill know how it tastes!
The seeds look like tiny dragon eggs :)))) this recipe is my favourite breakfast.. thats for the flavour ideas..
Chocolateeeeeeeee I will try first!!!!!!!!! ;)
I was skeptical at first, but made the chocolate chia pudding wow, it is thick and creamy just like pudding :)
I have just eaten chai pudding for the first time.... I used coconut milk and it is amazing..... I had to message to tell everyone to try this.... Love love love it!
thanks for the tips. beautiful, and  you know how to make good treats you got it going on honey.
Almond milk is highly processed junk. How are you teaching folks to keep healthy with such toxic base ingredient?
Hello dear. Trying to find foods that help me feel full other than eating a serving of oatmeal at every meal. I hope this fits the bill. I will most likely make the chocolate one first with fresh blueberries( I just got some) and garnish with almonds. I'll let you know how it turns out.
mucha coconut
Chocolate always looking for a healthy chocolate treat
*Clean And Delicious* Thanks for the video. I'll try it. Just a f.y.i. since you like healthy eating I discovered that when I make a smoothie & add avocado it makes it devine! I just love the bloopers you added by the way. 🌹💘🦋🕊
love u love your videos!!!
I made the matcha with peppermint
matcha  all the way
Please do the Matcha 101 video!  Can't wait!
I think I just found my new breakfast option...
I finally got around to preparing one of these tonight. It's chocolate and banana because I have bananas that are going soft. I almost didn't use sweetener because of the banana but I went ahead and added it because of the bitterness of the chocolate. It turns out the seeds I have are milled, not whole, so I don't know how that will affect the recipe.
Can I use a low fat milk .. I don't like the almond milk and the coconut milk ????
I would loooove to see a matcha 101 video!! ❤
Last time I did chia puding with cannabis milk. I blend cannabis milk with banana and strawberry , and than add watered chia, It tastes like youghurt!))
I think I want to combine the chocolate with the banana and strawberry. That would work, wouldn't it? Thanks so much. I can't wait to get home from work so I can make this. :-)
I make this in a magic bullet blender with blueberries,  makes a gorgeous color, and I add vanilla extract.  also try maple walnut,  it's tasty!  if you mill the seeds first, your body can access the nutrition,  otherwise it goes through your system as fiber, and we don't get much out of the chia that way.
l love all of the flavors. They look great. I have it with my cereal of oats, raisins, prunes. mango with milk. That's my breakfast.
i love matcha 😍😍😍
I'm going to try them all ... thanks!
Makes me hungry just watching this video! Double thumbs up:)
We're going to try the pudding first
Looks delicious!! Just made the strawberry Banana one. :-) Shouldn't this rather be called a snack? Since its only around 200 Calories, its not really filling enough for breakfast. At least not for me :-)
too much explain is not good ....
I think I'm going to try matcha. It looks delicious.
you can blend it and the texture will be sooo smooth and creamy!
wooow!!  looks yummmmmmy
Yum! I love chia pudding! I also just shared my own version on my channel! I absolutely love your take on this easy, healthy breakfast!
how about adding moringa powder to the chia pudding.
All of these recipes look awesome!
This was great! I recently moved into my first apartment without roommates, and I've been looking into ways to start a healthy living. I just made my first batch of these (blueberry, dark chocolate cherry, and berry mix) :-) I'm really excited. Thank you for sharing.
Do you have to use olmin milk?
can we use cows milk or only almond and cocunut milk should be used?? help ple..
Favorite combination:  chia + cacao chocolate  + oatmeal + ground flax + maple syrup + milk + raspberry
I love chia puddings, especially for how easy they are to make, it is one of our favourite breakfasts also!
Matcha 101!!!

Yes please do a Matcha 101
I'm going to try the basic one with banana and strawberries because I don't have the other ingredients with me.

macha 101please
is it ok for me to add all the toppings right away in each jar along with the chia pudding base? if so, can they still last 3- days? or do I have to wait until the pudding is solidify before I can have it with the toppings?
i love all of it ! Yumm😍
i want to try matcha pudding....
Ok, well this video answered my questions on the other video, lol.
how much milk is half a cup exactly? I tried this and I think I put too much milk because it was very liquid in the morning.
the jar you use is it 4oz or 8oz?
Can I use 'normal' milk? I can't afford alkond.
Chocolate yessss. Making that one tonight! Lol thanks for the good ideas #teamchocooate
Love them all!!! I really like the green tea and chocolate. I'm planning on making a few of the chia pudding too.

I was pleasantly surprised by the ease of preparation of this recipe! I just made a batch of the basic chia pudding (unsweetened coconut milk, honey), but I added half a handful of goji berries, and it was fantastic! I can't wait to see just how I'll vary this up in the future. Thank you so much for sharing this Dani!!!
matcha 101 pls. I will try the chai first, then the chocolate.
I am hooked on the chocolate and chai pudding!! Thank you for posting these lovely and simple recipes!
A great new treat! I tried the Banana Strawberry chia pudding a few days ago and now it's a must for me every morning.

When I put my lid on, I shake it like crazy. It mixes it up really great.  then I try to remember to go back in 10 or 15 minutes, and it another good Shake. What was the white topping on the chocolate chia seed pudding?
I love MATCHA. would love some more recipes! 101 sounds great!

Strawberry banana & matcha w/out the coconut.
Oh WOW! I didn't realize chia pudding is easy to make! I'm going to try doing the strawberry banana one!!!! 😎😎😎😎😎😎
the chai!! I didn't know how to mix up a chai flavor at home, thank you!!

hello, I appreciate your tipps & recipes very much. please answer me - can I cook overnight soaked chia ? in a soup for example? thank you  : )
thanks, its simple recipe
Matcha 101 please
after trying the chocolate pudding, I was thoroughly disgusted by the taste and thought about retaliating with a dislike. every time I try a (refined) sugar-free recipe I wind up practically spitting it out! Who are people trying to fool? it came nowhere close to delicious! However, I decided to comment first plead with anyone who might read my comment- what the heck did I do wrong?? I didnt have any alternative milks so I used regular and also substituted the maple syrup for honey..
Lovely recipes.  I have some lovely mangoes and i'm going to make me some chia mango pudding.  I'd love to try matcha but want to do a little bit of research before buying. So, Yes please to matcha 101.  Thank you.
I'll definitely try them all but for sure the matcha & coconut one first! 😍😋
I'd like to see a Matcha 101 :)
Ok, your genius knows no bounds! I'm going to make all of these! Especially with whole fat coconut milk 😋
YES to matcha 101! :)
Chocolate my fave, hands down!
Matcha 101 please
Yes, Matcha 101, please!  They all look delicious! I'm gonna try.
Chocolate first for sure
coconut milk with pineapple and banana so yummy
치아씨드 먹기가 힘들었는데 이런 레시피 진짜 고마워요! i was hard to eat chia seeds. but you help me thank u very much!
that was so much matcha! beginners should try much less!
Macha 101 plz!!
It seems the chocolate one would be oh so bitter as unsweetened cocoa is horribly bitter.
i love your channel!!!!
all of them!!
I love them all!!!
if I decrease the amount of almond milk, will it come out thicker, closer to a tapioca pudding and less runny?
These puddings sound great! My all-time favorite chia pudding flavor combination though is chocolate-peanut butter or chocolate-hazelnut butter :)
Would love a Matcha 101! These are all great ideas. Thanks!
The banana and strawberries is my fave. So glad chia seeds is now widely available in UK supermarkets and cheaper than health stores😀
Yay for the matcha on - never thought to make *green* chia pud! Have actually just made this one along with you, with homemade cashew milk and some raspberries on top for good measure. Yum!
I've enjoyed making it with kefir, various fruits (especially berries) and sprinkling pumpkin seeds for crunch on top. I use unsweetened kefir, and will add maple syrup to sweeten it myself.
Love the chocolate chia pudding. I added a tablespoon of PB powder to make it a Reese chia pudding. So good. Thanks
I'm going to make chocolate and matcha for breakfast! Matcha chia seed pudding sounds interesting😋
Matcha 101, pls! Just ordered 300 g organic matcha powder! It's here next week! 💚💚💚👌
I love chia pudding! The possibilities are endless!
Add more seeds that thickens it up. Matcha $$$
Do you think the pudding could be heated up? Thanks, Cathy.
Yes please on the matcha! Try macadamia milk it's delish 👍🏻
Matcha 101 please
They all look so yummy! I didn't know Chia seeds are higher in fat. Good fat??
Matcha pls :)
can you use milled chia seeds for this?
Yes definitely yes to Macha 101
I make the chocolate chia pudding with coconut milk and you are right Dani, it's the bomb! :)
Really want to try this will need to buy chia seeds first
I used flax seeds because I didn't have any chia seeds on hand and it was just as good!
#TeamChocolate and yes Matcha 101 would be great
I love matcha, but never thought to put it in chia pudding. I normally put it in a green smoothie in the morning and feel like it gives just a little energy boost, but not jittery or overpowering. I've read that it's a more alkalizing form of caffeine than coffee or black tea, and if you choose organic it can be slightly detoxifying. I just really like it and notice a difference when I use it. Thanks for the recipe!
MATCHA FOR SURE:)))))) thanks for the wonderful ideas
def a matcha 101 please
I love chia puddings, my fav is pumpkin.  I also put chia in my overnight oatmeal. a 101 on Matcha would be great.
Ahh I have a whole bag in my cabinet! Cannot wait to try the chocolate! I have a sweet tooth and have to watch my sugar intake this is perfect! Where do you get your matcha?
YES PLEASE! Matcha 101!!
Love it! Just made the chocolate one :D
I would like to see the dessert option with coconut milk- do you use the one from the can?
I love chia pudding. I soaked my overnight with water and add heavy whipping cream and Greek yogurt the next day. Thanks for all your videos
loveeee, loveeee, loveeeeee chia puddings just discover them a week ago and they are delicious!!! My fave is one mix with rose jam (but any jam would work and the possibilities are endless), I have to try the chocolate one also ;), great flavours!!!!!
i don't know why, but I always crack up when you say "pudding".
i love chocolate chia pudding 😋😋. . its amzing. .
Will try the green matcha, the chocolate,I love! Thanks for sharing Dani ;)
What was the white stuff you put on top of the chocolate pudding one?
Chocolate & chai are my faves!! 🙏🏼
Matcha 101 for sure please! I want to make the chocolate chia pudding. Looks delicious 😋
thank you for the yummy combinations, I've been having Chia pudding with natural yogurt and it's amazing with some fresh fruit but now I wanna try the chocolate one 🍫
Love your matcha-covered fingers.
Chocolate and Chai are definitley going to be first!!
I'm more of a 400 kcal breakfast kinda person..   Still gonna try it though, it looks delicious!
I would definitly want to see a GOOD matcha latte recipe. I tried it in a cafe and it was sooo good! tried it myself and it tasted super bitter and just bad...(even with honey)
Yes please, matcha 101
i really love the chocolate been doing it for about  2 years now  have done with fullcream  coconut milk or  almond milk  both are  Delicious   works well with lactose free  cream  too  i suggest freeze it a little  before serving  its almost like  chocolate  ice cream  mouse
Absolutely love your channel! I have practically gone my whole life so far eating processed foods and I'm just starting to adjust to eating clean, wholesome foods which is difficult mostly because I'm not used to cooking at all! But your videos have helped me learn so many things I didn't before and have made the overall transition so much easier. By far my favorite food channel!!!
yes please a matcha 101 video would be greatly appreciated! 😁
I tried making some chia pudding.. The seeds fell to the bottom of the container and didn't thicken up.  Why do you think that happened?
Hi Dani! Do you think you can do like a "healthier version of candy bar favorites" like a clean and delicious version of a Reese's peanut butter cup?  That would be amazinggg
Chocolate ofcourse! Must try the Macha & the Chai flavours too. Yum!
yes on the matcha 101 :)
you had me at chai.
You have the best recipes think you so much
Do you use sweet or unsweetened coconut? Frozen?
Yes please matcha 101
Matcha coconut!! Mindblowing!!
Team Matcha 🍵 all the way!!! Thanks; great recipes
Matcha 101, please, and what is Maca???  I don't have a favorite, or rather, they are ALL my favorite!
Matcha matcha matcha! I just discovered this at the Toronto Tea Festival in February. I have been hooked. Any recipes with matcha will get a like from me. Thanks, Dani!
I tried the almond joy cookies and took some to work they were a big hit I wanna try the chocolate one looks good! thank you and keep the recipes comming
Chocolate for the chocoholic😄 or maybe a zesty one🤔
yes please to that match a 101. Thanks
Yes, please, matcha 101!
Yes! Yes! Yes!  Tell us more about matcha.  xoxo
I can actually have these as a part of my raw vegan diet! You have no idea how happy I am about that.
the matcha and coconut milk, chocolate pudding are great
Love these recipes!!! Thank you!! Love chia!!
yes please to the Matcha 101
matcha & chocolate! yummy
peanut butter-chocolate,matcha 101 please!!!😘
I have unsweetened cashew milk and unsweetened coconut milk too. I'm definitely going to make these! Yummerz!
great vid, definitely going to try it! excited to have a  healthy plus tasty breakfast.. A++
Matcha 101 please!! I love your videos, recipes, tips & tricks! Thank you so much!!
Hi Dani, have you tried Greek yogurt with chia seeds to increase the creaminess? Love your vids!
Matcha 101 would be awesome!.... I make mango pudding - blend really ripe mango with ginger, coconut milk and pinch of cardamom and pour it into a dish with chunks of mango and seeds. If you want it to be more dessert, sweeten it. If I'm going that route, then I opt for the ginger cubes in syrup instead of fresh ginger. I've tried it with the dried candied ginger but didn't like it as much. The ones in syrup are softer.
I'm crazy for chia pudding! I love the matcha idea since I'm obsessed with matcha lattes that I make at home. When I make chocolate chia pudding I have added Goji berries which has become a favorite for me. Many thanks!
matcha 100%
Chocolate!!! 🤤
Chocolate for sure❗️❗️❗️
awesome recipes!!! I love chia seeds so much!
I'm going to try chocolate for sure!
I've never had chia seeds before, I plan to try these. Thank you so much!
Coconut Mango Chia pudding is my favorite! Never thought of making Matcha-Chia combination. Trying it out tomorrow🙌
Yes please on the matcha 101.
Putting 3-5 grams of Guar/Xantan gum makes these pudding connect better being firmer even without full fat milks ;)
Would love to hear about matcha 101!! Love from NJ.
I just had chia pudding yesterday! And I had a matcha smoothie bowl for breakfast!
Hm, the matcha one intrigues me. Can I just put some green tea into my spice grinder and use that? 😁 I've never had matcha, but I've heard the cheap ones aren't good, and more expensive ones really cost a fortune. And what is the difference to green tea anyway? Except the manner of preparation? Hm, I guess, you will have to do a video about matcha 😆
Oh, I never knew chia seeds contain protein....I'm the rare health freak who hasn't tried them yet. I always thought they were more like flax seed, nutritionally speaking. Well, maybe I should give them a chance, I mean, if YOU say they're good 😆
Hi! I love these ideas! Do you have a recommendation for a good full fat coconut milk?
These look really yummy! I love all your videos and have made some of your recipes before and they are great! I would love a video on matcha basics as I am new to it too! Keep up the good work!
i'm gonna make the chocolate one with coconut milk for dessert 😍😍😍
matcha 101 for sure
Whenever I drink milk a lot of times I like the silk almond coconut milk because it's the perfect amount of thickness for me.
I love all these chia pudding recipes.!!! I love chia seeds. I've used in a smoothie! I'd love to try the matcha chia pudding and the chocolate of course. Yes please do a matcha 101!!
Thank you for the recipes, they look yummy.  I was just wondering what else can I add chia seeds besides my water I drink through out the day....:-)
DANI SPIES CAN DO NO WRONG !
Team chocolate all the way! And yes to Matcha 101!
I could never use the matcha as it has huge amounts of caffeine (green tea).  Caffeine at those levels is very bad for the heart. But Like I said in the previous comment, I will definitely try your version of the Chai pudding because you did it without caffeine. Thanks again!
I definitely want to make the chocolate one, but add peanut butter and coconut!
I am so happy that your Chai pudding does not contain any source of caffeine!!  I don't comsume caffeine,  so thank you so much!!!  These sound delicious!!
I'll try chocolate pudding first... 👍🏻👍🏻
Thank Dani, I would like to see more vegan recipes pls
Cannot wait to try every single one of these! Thanks, Dani 😀
I'll try all but the matcha since I don't have that on hand. ? How long do chia seeds stay fresh? what's the best way to store them? Thanks, Dani!
love your channel btw 😊
I've never had a chia pudding before, but I have everything on hand to try the chocolate recipe! Going to make it now! #teamchocolate 🍫😋
MATCHA 101!!!
The strawberry banana was my favorite. I want to try it with bananas and peaches. The chocolate was also great.  I am really thankful for this because I tried chia pudding and it didn't come out right.  You have encouraged me to try again. thanks.
amazing video :) I think I will try the chocolate and then the matcha :) and yes a matcha 101 would be great :)
amazing video! and a matcha 101 would be great :)
I love mine with one teaspoon of Ovaltine(20 cal), one teaspoon of PB2(20 cal), Banana and a few almonds. yum!
Just bought my first Matcha powder and looking forward to some creative and healthy recipes. I will be trying the Chia pudding for sure!
I'll try the banana strawberry one first. And I think I'll try an apricot+coconut combo.
Chia pudding is bomb!!! I meal prep it in a parfait on some weeks :)
Like, like, like! 🙂 Yesss matcha 101!!! Also it would be great if you could give us inspirations on how to use it. Thanks Dani!! 👍🏼👍🏼

Strawberry and banana pudding for the win.
Excited to try them all - except the chocolate. I'm the rare person who isn't a chocoholic! I would love that Matcha 101 video.
Amazing! I love your ideas! I will defo try with coconut milk 😍 but I'll try the fruity one too 😍❤💋
Hi. Would it be possible for you to teach us how to add chia seed in a healthy homemade breakfast pancake recipe?? Many thanks 😊
Looks amazing and love the health benefits that come with chia seeds. Will use these recipes with clients but unfortunately chia seeds aggravate my adult cystic acne. Very frustrating as I can not eat many heathy sources of fats like nuts, nut butters, flaxseeds, chia seeds without a horrible break out on my face:(
Please do a Matcha 101!!
definately macha coconut 😁
Were do you purchase the Matca..
did mine! it's chocolate! I wanted mine thicker so I put less milk and a bit of greek yogourt. we'll see
chocolate chia, is my  favorite.
i love pandan chia pudding so green so clean so good!!
This is gunna sound weird but can anyone explain what this would taste like,  And how it is in your mouth like do you feel/taste the seeds a lot, I not too much of a seed person lool
matcha my lover
I'm gonna try the chocolate one with strawberries and bananas. 🤗
I have done the chocolate one in the past but I feel like I didn't sweeten it enough. I'll have to try it again.
Team Chocolate!  😆
LOVE chocolate chia pudding! i usually make a big batch and eat throughout the week. Yum. The matcha one sounds good too🙂
I like your videos the moment I hit play haha!
Yes please, I'd really like a matcha 101 video.
Beautiful recipes, I love Chia seeds, they are also loaded with fiber. I recently found a huge container of Organic ones under the brand Badia for like $16. It is like 4lbs of organic chia seeds. I put them in tons of smoothies and recipes. I love the puddings too.
woop! these look awesome!
I think I'll try the chocolate first 😋 Would these little dishes be a good lunch size for me to lose weight but still nourish my body? I'm recovering from surgery. Haven't tried the Matcha powder or tea. Would definitely be interested in learning more about it please.  Thanks 😊
yes! matcha101 for sure!
love the chocolate one!! I've had chocolate chia seed pudding a few times and it's so good...and the one time I tried a plain vanilla flavor, my brain was like "this needs to be chocolate, why isnt this chocolate?!" 😅 I've got to try it with the coconut milk!! is that the kind that comes in the can, or the kind that comes in the milk carton because I've seen both?!
Thank you for the recipes, they all look really delicious! I also appreciate the Nutrients Info, it is really helpful! :)
Hi! I have an advice for you:) When you mix matcha with liquid, it's better to put matcha first. In this recepi, you should put matcha powder before you pour almond milk;^] Thanks for sharing the recepi! Love from Japan<33
Matcha 101 pleeeeeaaase! and another meal prep if you dont mind ☺
Yes to matcha, never tried it yet, I like mango blackberry
gonna give this a try😃😃... looks nice and delicious...
Hah ! I'm eating chia pudding as I watch this, just simple old vanilla is the one for me :)
