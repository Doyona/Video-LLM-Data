We're back with another series of Australian tiny house tours! This is such a great home and we really love the story of this build. Thanks for watching! For those who would like to support the channel and help us produce more content, we do have a Patreon page! https://www.patreon.com/livingbig - Thanks, and we'll see you next week!
With some videos I don’t know what’s more exciting: seeing the gorgeous homes or meeting the wonderful owners.
😍😍😍😍
Did they have a washer and dryer or how do they wash?
Are there any plans available? I'm a Grama and single so I'd have to have to have some build it but your place is amazing!
This one is my favorite of any I've seen. It's awesome!!
Lovely people and house!
Lovely home!
Beautiful, the only thing is they should have made a stand up bedroom, over time as they get older the crawling is not going to work for their backs. The best tiny homes are the ones with STAND up bedrooms.
Тамаша 🎉🎉
Bery elegant and calm one
Nice one Bryce, any chance of a revist, 5 years is a long time, I wonder what, if anything they have done differently. Love those gorgeous dogs...  I love that everyone who lives in a Tiny Home reads real books....., rocks, crystals, books, art & music its like they are prerequisites to Tiny Home building... cheers from WA... we still in 2024 don't have many Tiny Homes over here in WA :(....
Can anyone please tell me the title of the book he's reading. About tiny homes. I saw Bryce in there
Anyone wants to embark on building tiny homes in Zimbabwe 🇿🇼, people have no idea about this and we're missing out .These houses are lit❤
this is a beautiful house... are there plans for it somewhere with those wonderful folding up glass doors along the living area side?
Of course it is a spacious home and is beautiful but l love that the adorable sweet little pups have been included. Especially a fenced yard so they can be safely let outside when you are not outside with them. They wouldn't be able to fight off many wild Australian Animals. They can always run free when mum&dad are outside walking with them. Nice to see a married couple who still enjoy each other's company. Their wee caravan business is totally AWESOME!!!👍🏻😄🐾🌈☮️🇨🇦
❤
Well, I don’t know if they’ll ever see this, or if anyone else knows…  And yes, I love their house and them;   —But I really want to know what kind of dogs those sweet little pups are!!  🤗 I want to snuggle them~!   💞 Does anyone know?   🙉
Wow beautiful tiny house nice fresh colour look warm fire . Is so awesome 👏
This is probably one of the cheapest yet big and beautiful tiny homes I’ve seen so far! They did a fantastic job and such a cute couple.
Love this one!  Beautiful design choices, and as an older person, I really appreciate the added space in the bathroom and the sleeping loft.  Beautiful colors and wood, and I love the use of pipes for railings and shelving. Delightful place!
I really, really like the cabinetry & the armoire next to the fridge. I wouldn't want to DIY every single thing & that's an obvious decision.
Awesome couple
Can’t stand in bedroom.....a big no.
We are gonna see? So 4,5 yeares isnt going to take it? My fuckiing good!
Absolutely Amazingly Stunning 🥰 🥰
Wow so inspiring 😍
I LOVE how you designed your place. I would design Mine that way.  I also enjoy the humor you have. It’s a joy to watch. And I watch it often.
Love the open design. A tiny house can be spacious and still have a minimal imprint. And the location is amazing. One can see the pride this couple has in creating this lovely home themselves and in achieving their goal of having more freedom to do what they want to do. They've certainly earned it!
Absolutely love this!! Can’t wait to do a tiny house in my future xxx
One of the better ones I've seen!!  Nothing is worse than waking up and hitting your head with the roof of your house which is what I feel like happens with some of them!!
I like their house.  Was that steel framing they used?  I like the openness. Laundry? I mostly love their little Cairn terriers!!!!  My first dog was a black Cairn just like them!!!  Smart, fun, & loving dogs!!!!
Love the bathroom! I'll  bet since this aired they have added a washer/ dryer somewhere.
Gorgeous Home and Lifestyle CONGRATULATIONS!👏🏾👏🏾😁❤ TYFS!
😍 This couple is one of the rare ones -- work AND live together HARMONIOUSLY. And they've been married a LONG time! They won the lottery in the relationship department. They still act like a couple of teenagers with one another but also, very clearly, very grown up at the same time. Oh, and yeah, their tiny house is gorgeous :)) Such a great testimony to their friendship-partnership. I hope they have many, many more years enjoying each other's company. 🥰😍🤩
Wash machine?
I really love the aesthetics of this tiny house. I am definitely putting this into my faves. The couple are really lovely too. I can't wait until I can showcase my own tiny house...probably a few years away but I'm super excited 😆 ☺️
One of the biggest tiny houses I have seen.  Such a high-level finish and for such a low cost.
lovely house and lovely couple .
Bryce could you please add the dimensions of the houses in the description of the videos please ? It would be easier to find again after watching!! :))
She snuck more books in...my kind of girl!
Great stuff guys koodos on your build , looking at your projects makes me even more excited about starting mine. Cheers
I really love this tiny home so spacious
A beautiful home.
Tiny house linda...
Köszönöm szépen! Minden és mindenki nagyon szép és boldog . A kutyusok is!
I love this woman 😍
This home is absolutely beautiful! I could see myself living in the very cleaver & spacious home.😍. Would it be possible to get the detailed plans for this home? I live in the US and the folding doors are so unique and perfect! We don't have builds like this here
Я смотрю каждый фильм, как интересно, почему его не кто по русскому не заменят
Any updates on this couple with more built?
How refreshing to see this uncomplicated couple telling their honest experience- no dreams come true with out sweat and tears !
I love their home.  I would add a washer dryer in the bathroom and add a large opening skylight above the bed,  but love the room proportions, finishes and their doggos!
Love the window  in ur bdrm
Beautiful
Love this house! How do they do laundry, though?
Very nice project
ONLY WORK 2 DAYS A WEEK!?!? Wow! 👏🏼
Bed room is not proper
How wide are those folding doors? Wow!
The only thing I dislike about some tiny houses is using a compost toilet. I don’t have the stomach to mess with those.
"I love a nice fire and there's a lot of timber we can use. So, the dogs had to fit in as well" had me do a double take
I didn't see a washer. It is a gorgeous home, it would be nice to have an update; do they have grandkids? Anything they did along the way living in their tiny. Thanks.
Those bi-fold doors are awesome. I would love to have those. Especially in that setting.
Tiny house, with a lovely big deck. I love it!
How many Square Feet is this house? and what are the materials you used for framing and buliding?
It's really spacious.but the TV placement is not practical.
I’m in Byron I will pay you to build me one that cheap
45k bs that’s not true , but I guis they build it themselves
Love this home! I would be VERY interested in learning about the build in detail. I have been looking at hundreds of homes and this one is in my top all time 5!
With that huge door that they leave open must mean there are no mosquitoes in Australia!
The location looks dangerous its very close to the edge of the hill with global warming and what’s going on I Wouldn’t put that house right at the edge of a hill
Stupefaction 💅.I respect your family value and your wisdom appears very strongly.Please never change your originality for sake of others because ,no one can play your role better than you .So be yourself you are best.Thank Q so much for choosing such a congenital atmosphere and hats off to ur enthusiasm.Please germinate more flowers garden 🙏.
This couple is living the life I want to live!!! 💜💜💜💜💜
♥️♥️♥️
What a lovely couple - and a lovely house.
私は日本人ですから、外国人の生活はわかりません。英語もわかりません。ただ、気になるのは、冷蔵庫が小さいと思いますが大丈夫ですか？小さい家に入れていると思いますが、外国人は買いだめをするので実際は大きな冷蔵庫がいるのではないですか？私は景色の良い所に住みたいですが、日本では景色の良い所はそこは不便な所です。ちょっと家電が気にかりますね。買い物はなるべく一度ですませるか、自分で作物を育てる方法がいいかとは思いますが、生活に喜びを見つけるのはいろいろ方法があるかとは思います。アメリカンドリームのような気もします。ステキでセンスよく。合理的で、ステキと思いますが、日本では無理かな。 夢のような家を見せてもらってうれしいです。
私がいつも気になるのは、キッチンです。　　お水はどうしてるの？排水はどう？ 使いやすいキッチンですか？
Stunning house- simple clean lines - open and big space- practical and functional- love the doors and future deck and at an amazing price!! Well done!
so inspired!!! so many ideas floating in my head..... Now I need to hit the lottery! lol
Awesome home....Bryce love watching u...
To beautiful to be true,I love yalls  gorgeous place.Simlpy beautiful!
Congratulations.  Your self built tiny home is amazing.
Just love this couple's place
Hermoso lugar... Y muy Hermosa casa!
Amei essa Tony, maravilhosa. O espaço é inacreditável.
Is a very nice tiny home but my opinion is to don’t have pets inside the house
Those sliding glass doors are a bit pricey.
If I can’t have that house can I have the larder cupboard, please? 😅
What an adorable couple…. and their house is just gorgeous, love this episode xx
I wonder if Bryce lives in a tiny house? Would be a great show! He must have plenty of ideas by now.
Looking great guys! Congratulations!
This is one of my favourite tiny homes on the series and also the owners and their attitude and outlook on life!
I’m so jealous of their lifestyle and business That is so cool!
This tiny house is really beautiful 👍👍👍👍👍
Loving my hometown South London twang from these two.  Still not lost it after 11 years in Oz!
This is one of the nicest interiors I've seen for a tiny house. Seems open, spacious and livable. And they did it all themselves! Incredible job!
These two are what marriage is all about.  It’s obvious they are happy empty nesters but still value their relationships with family.  They have built a beautiful tiny home that fits their life style.  I love the fact that they have switched, the week off and work on the week ends.   Their planning paid off!
They did a fantastic job on this place, It’s very beautiful!   I also love that they’ve been together for 30yrs, that’s fantastic!!   To me, that makes their home even more beautiful!!!  ..God Bless!
I love how simple yet spacious this is
I like their paint color combination
I need to get rich enough to be that friend that owns a forest lol
Refreshingly real and down to earth folks.
What a wonderful couple.  They did a magnificent job on their tiny home.  It not only looks comfortable but is pleasing to the eye.  Bravo!  PS:  Are the two dogs Cairn terriers?   Little Totos.
Love the lady's energy and humour !! :) very positive!
One of the best and with a proper lounge!!
I think this one’s my new favorite. I said that probably 15 times and I save them all in “my future tiny abode” playlist 🤍 I feel so inspired
👍🙏♥️♥️🙏👍
No washing machine
Need a mate who own a forest or a river or a hill man😍🥺🥺🥺🥺
Amazing couple with a great home! 👌💎👌
Neat Tiny House; but, If I were chosen to have I would prefer it to be on a beautiful quiet street/area in the City.
The craven hurricane realistically recognise because marimba scientifically mend at a halting rowboat. different, aspiring snowman
Brice, your passion for this stuff is phenomenal! All your vids are fab fab fab!!!!
Get married to ur dream girl.. lived in a tiny house.. cooking tasty dishes with ur loved ones.. that's the better definition of enjoying life..
The depressed germany occasionally smell because chill briefly relax apud a distinct plastic. mixed, various attempt
Que bela casa. 😍 Bem minimalista!
The shut ease culturally tumble because giraffe interestedly bat around a conscious defense. smoggy, unbecoming craftsman
This is in my top 3. It's just so cute and cozy, off grid, wood stove, fabulous kitchen and bath, roomy sleeping loft. Love it! 💋💖
The adhesive tray compellingly stuff because stick conservatively search than a tricky sweatshop. brainy, high-pitched alphabet
Too Good, Very nice Butiful House 🏠...🌹❤️
Jealous of this one. Beautiful house! Great way to live 👍🏻
I love the tiny houses that are just a tad more spacious.
Love this house.
I'm sure I know Kevin, wonder if he's from Bristol UK. Thank you Bryce - love what you are doing, you are so good at engaging with all these folk..... Me and my partner are so inspired from your channel..... getting started seems a bit overwhelming...
What a lovely couple. This channel is my happy place
Awesome shed building plans, next time use it
Be careful of pine cones. They are terrific for fir starters but they can cause sticky sap in the flu and can cause a fire over time where you don't want it to be
Nice and very cozy.
Great couple Great tiny house 🏠 👌
Lovely place, but why ya'll washing your gound beef XD . Should I be doing this?!
This is probably my favorite Tiny House so far!
Such cute dogs. Nice house with a very spacious bathroom.
Nice work,  nice happy couple jen&kev, cute 2🐕🐕, wellness business got it almost all... now they need to own that bit of land too 👏💃
For once we see a Tiny Home with a decent size spacious bathroom. They've done a very good job!
This is a cool story!! Low budget too...lik'n smoothie carovan great job y'll!!!  Like the bathroom, storage space and rain water idea
Thank you for sharing your TINY HOME it’s so very beautiful love everything you did to make it your own. I hope you both have many years of happiness together. Nice to be empty nesters . YAY ❤️❤️🙏🙏
Awesome house! 😁
Married 30 years?!?!?!?
Absolutely lovely!
Cool couple.. i enjoyed their conversation... and their home though simple is so lovely...💖😘
La casa , muy grande , solo que el techo de la habitación está hecha para enanos . Eso de tener que caminar x el dormitorio encorvado como un jorobado,  no me gusta nada .
I love this lifestyle!! No bills!!
Very beautiful
Awesome couple, spacious home, interesting experience and bathroom something!  A little wider than usual and already has so much space!  So nice and positive and friendly.  So many smiles, laughter and a sense of humor that I myself did not stop smiling while watching!  Thanks!
Looks like I have to leave the U.S
It’s beautiful how did you build it I thought it was a trailer
The four frail helicopter problematically bless because cost interestedly please unto a unknown argument. cloistered, juicy spike
Absolutely gorgeous home.
Such a lovely couple....
Nice, but I would be afraid of those stairs :)
I absolutely love their bathroom set up...🥰
Love this home❤❤⚘
how do they get to do 3m wide?
Cute dogs
💙🤗
More difficult in Finland because we have cold winter. Need very strong insulation and still working air conditioning.
Love the house and their life style.... "simply" beautiful!!!!
Probably the most comfortable home and down to earth, relatable couple so far.  Good for them!
Дорогой Брайс, пора делать русские субтитры! То, что Вы делаете... абсолютно восхитительно!!! Absolutely stunning!!!
I like the bathroom, but I would have gone with one vanity and a bathtub
Very nice place 🥰
That looks really nice inside and out I wouldn’t mind living in that I wish he could make me one or who ever made it make me one
Hi lovely. another lovely tiny house. But it looks so spacious inside. really happy for them. lovely couple😊
Beautiful home.. It feels sooooo spacious!
Very lovelt couple!!! They are always still young and lively.  Also really nice tiny house.
Very nice Tiny House. One suggestion however. Especially since you're very handyman and self build it. I would cut the roof on top of the bedroom area. Install a frame and some sort of a lifting device that would give you that extra 40-60 cm just enough for the bedroom to become a real human height. Especially if your house is on some kind of a more stable location. Whenever you need to travel you bring that roof area down and you're at legal height again. You can install that on a push button device too. It would change your life forever trust me. If you liked my idea please let me know how it changed your life. Thank you.
Magic creation
Lol they’re funny talking about their relationship struggle while building
I don't see the tiny part. You two must have lived in a mansion before if you think that's tiny. Lol
really like that one. like that it so roomy and open.
Great Job! Building a house was easy because you guys already had the tool (a marriage 30 years!). Love the house, beeeautiful. One love, Jamaica
This tiny house is so beautiful
Wondering how these folks are doing now with the event restrictions and lock downs, how is their business holding up?
This might be my favorite tiny home layout I’ve seen on this channel. Incredibly kind couple as well!
this is  not a tiny house!
Such a nice couple
I love this show. I love everyone’s vision of there homes. But I need to live in the city where I can go to Quick Trip anytime for a cappuccino. Hehehe!
I admire this very hard working couple. Beautiful home, view, lifestyle!
What a lovely couple.  Their home is beautiful, love all that open space.  Well done!
I can't believe that their bathroom that big fits in their tiny house 🏡
Soooooo amazing. Damn. Cant wait for the build
I would Have to have an AC in there. It’s so hot!!
Hey ya just wondering what breed of dog they are? So cute!
The dogs are adorable little chonks.
Their lifestyle is a complete dream! Not following the rath race, but just finding complete peace! Love 🧡
Wonderful couple n awesome house. My favorite part is huge glass doors that makes you feel spacious n see the open view. I would love if I become their Neighbor.
I like this one. It's the roomiest tiny yet!
Happy for them ! *Good place to live.*
Awesome diy house n couple👍👍👍👍
How high is this house and what are the legal height limits in Australia? I notice people rarely mention height in these videos. It would be very helpful to know. Here in Italy I’m told the height limit is 4 meters from the ground. That seems quite low for building lofs...
The couple and the house, both are so nice 😊
This is lovely and what a great way to enjoy life
this is how im tryna be when im 50
I love everything, except for the clothes wardrobes in the bathroom.
I love the honesty of this couple doing any project together especially house building is going to cause stress and disagreements. Building a normal house is bad enough 🤣 Done that now on my next project a van build  x
Beautiful
So beautiful people, and wonderful home.
If they make this home in my country, the next day morning they will found themselves only, Nothing else! 🤣🤣🤣 People won't leave a cup also for them.
All tiny houses focus on outdoor spacing so what about the security? As most of the parking spots are in country sides some kinda separated spaces..
Looked into tiny houses here in Ontario, Canada. Apparently the are illegal! What!
My favorite!!!!
I love how honest they talk about how it almost cost there marriage...and to see how happy they are now, <3
At 60 yrs old...I KNOW ALL about SHADE. I'm a personal thermo nuke device.
My new favorite tiny home.  Great setting and nice owners/builders, too. 🌿
Best one so far
Absolutely beautiful couple! You can really see the effort and energy they put into the home is all about passion and tackling a challenge together! Good on them and congratulations on a fantastic job!
So many of this tiny house owners are on other peoples property. Of course its easily doable if its on someone else's land.
What a beautiful and good example of a couple with a lovely amazing tiny home. I love the conversation. This is one of the best episodes from this channel for me. Edit: I hope there is a revisiting episode for this couple since they were just living at that moment for 4 weeks. Or maybe, it already have but I don't watch it yet...
Love their house! Their food truck is really lovely too. I hope they're doing well in 2020, it must be a difficult year for this lifestyle.
Love it,  Love your hairstyle bryce.. xoxo
I love it when I see a tiny house with a four burner stove! As someone who loves to cook, it'd be impossible to get by with a two burner.
Really enjoyed this look into an incredible lifestyle. The generous and stylish space within the design is so inspiring
Beautiful home and couple.
Loving these builds with a pretty realistic budget and so hyped that this one can go full off the grid! Loving it!
30 years !!!! Wow lovely couples
Wonderful all around.  And nice people.
❤
DIY makes such an incredible difference financially. I can’t imagine my husband and I being able to do what they’ve done. Amazing work.
Did I miss the washer/dryer? Otherwise, I totally love this tiny home!
Lovely ❤️
Ngomong apaan oiii
it's quite a big house!
The doggies are so cute!!
I love how honest they are about the build process. It may give you this incredible end product that helps you forget the trials but they did happen along the way and its refreshing to hear a little more of the reality for those heading into this life.
We are almost empty nesters!  Thanks for the inspiration for life after kids.
Best couple ever
By far this is my favorite tiny house, it is so open, spacious, and simple...
Just gorgeous
Another great story, wonderful couple. Good luck and I love their home. Thank you for sharing your home and Bryce great information is always conveyed. Stay, safe and healthy everyone. Anna Banana - hugs to all of you! Big smile here!
Smart builders!!
What!! Love this house and the couple! They must have gotten married at like 18 and had kids right away, they look so young !💛
sweet boy... nice tats
Love this couple and their wonderful attitude on life. Their home is stunning.  My husband and I could move right in there. It is so cozy!  Boy would I love to taste one of their juices!
Loved this tiny house and loved this couple, particularly she, who laughs a lot!  They transmit joy. Thank you for this episode :)
I like the light inside it. The arrangement is very nice.
Love the show, but some, like in this vid, I wouldn't say they are tiny. This is about as big as some apartments I've had in Chicago.
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Dream life, job, retirement, and house!  Love it!
Bryce, you're going to become famous as the tiny house guy with the black T-shirt. :)
i loved their story, best wishes to them!
I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS COUPLE....MOST SINCERELY.  They are the quintessential models of GREAT RELATIONSHIPS.  That house is mind blowing and that bathroom...wow. I have to stop watching these I'm becoming addicted
A tiny spacious home! Thank you!! It’s amazing... especially the outdoor space!!🦋🦋🦋 The smoothie biz is the icing on it all!!🥰🥰🥰
This house is one of the best I have seen in this channel so far. But one thing I couldn't quite understand (because it seems way too big): was this house built of a container?
Muito lindo♥️
Absolutely beautiful empty nester tiny home! ❤️
Definitely envious 😐
The best given truth,time is limited and precious.That couple knows how to navigate in life.They have done a wonderful job!!
Bryce i love this couple. doing a build after 30 yrs together is phenomenal.
$54 grand? Finally someone who spent a lot less but looks a lot nicer.
When will u come to hot places like India
OMG, this couple is totes adorable!  And the way they figured out how to maximize the enjoyment of their new, empty-nester status is genius & inspiring! This is one of my favorite tiny house "stories"!
$54k is Amazing! It really gives me hope!
Hubby and I are looking to buy acres of wooded land with Mountain Views in Colorado or Northern New Mexico, to build a small or perhaps even tiny dream home on. Dreaming of someday our kids and grandkids joining us as often as they can
Amei.
Such a happy couple! 💖💖
Very nice
This is my favourite tiny house. It's perfect.
Wow, this is one of the most practical and esthetically impressive builds...Well done!! Cheers!
Yay finally UK people haha 😱 beautiful bathroom and love the space, only thing I don't like is the colour of the sofa, doesn't go with the house ha.. that lounge space could be utilised better
love the front doors but the bugs
Deck sounds suspiciously much like.. something else xD 1:10
Love this Tiny House idea so much!!!!! we are actually considering starting our own project once I can work  remotely or online!!!! Cant wait to start a life that is simpler!!!
I loved their house so much after watching so many of  these other videos, its super spacious and airy. Love their color theme too.
One of my favorite tiny house! And their life style is amazing
your outfit is boring..seen them in all your vids..you need to change.
Vicarious freedom/liberation is what stories like this give me, and consequently, inspiration. It's gppd to dream again. Thank you
I love that house. that bathroom is huuuuuge!!!
“You’ve definitely capitalized on that by building this nice big Dick”
Gud house, good accomodation, but I still feel, that there shud have more room fr the ceiling at their bedroom. It wud give me claustrophobia I guess.
A beautiful home
14 m = about 46 ft not 32
I missed a washing maschine...
Somehow I feel Mr husband has a great sense of humor.
Cool episode. they seem like a genuine and funny couple. Nice tiny home!! Love those doors :)
This house is nice, but there is a point where I'd stop calling some of these houses "tiny houses"...this size is honestly just more of a "slightly smaller than normal" size house in my opinion. Don't really know if it falls in the "tiny house" category. 🤷‍♀️ ~:~
This is my favourite tiny home so far
this is one of my favorites tiny houses in this show!
I have seen a couple of Australian tiny houses go 3m wide but the limit is 2.5m. Did they just ignore it or is there another option?
This couple is so genuine. ❤️
These folks did very well
This has got to be one of the best channels on youtube, it's just full of good people and positivity. The host is an absolut top human being too.
An inspirational couple.
I have fallen in love with this tiny house but looking at it from inside it has a good the state to the art. I have liked that innovative design and the way they use their water, power and how safe  alot money its a good model to create an enabling environment and assisting in housing challenges.
AWESOME tiny house love it!!!!
Were they born already married?
love this home and this couple!!!!
What a good looking couple & amazing home as well❤
I love your hair cut like this! One of my top 3 tiny homes! Love ❤️
Great effort! Love the design...its a tiny house, but nothing is really that tiny...bath/dressing room is a revelation. Well done!
This is the tiny house i loved so far! very spacious , neat and simple i love the folding door ever! :D  This tiny house is my  number one favorite.  :D
Sometimes it would be nice to get to the point. Therefore, I put playback speed to 2.
Really pretty home, it looks comfortable.
Wow ! Great couple, great home, great lifestyle, nice bathroom!
Bryce: So, how big is this tiny home? Kev: 14 meters by 3 meters Me: So, how big is this tiny home?
Your Cairn Terriers are beautiful...and so is the house!  ;)
Did I just miss it, or do they not have a washing machine in their house?
I have a laugh every time Bryce says "deck" and the CC writes out "dick". Especially because he is usually talking about how big it is.
Beautiful
Genial
Absolutely stunning I love this tiny house so much
I'd be petrified of snakes coming inside (the doors open) , then when asleep getting a 😱 fright I'd never forget!!!
I watched this tiny house video one year ago. It's so good, I had to watch it again. The best I've seen and most definitely suits all our needs. Do I detect English accents? 🤔                      👍😎👍
So awesome!!😊
AWESOME ♥️
Are there tiny house’s without sleeping lofts ? I just find them so creepy
I feel that you visit some of these tinyhouses a little bit to soon. It feels like most of these people have lived there between 2-6 months, and i feel that should be atleast the double. I want you to visit people who really have stand the test of living there for a longer time. A couple of years.
This looks like a super comfortable house! Nice surroundings as well.
raising a larger set (sheet) of solar panels a foot or so off of the roof should both help create a tad of shade and help add power if he does want  to add 'aircon'. It also help tilt the panels to catch the most sun. That closet in the bathroom is the WORST place to store clothes.
What a lovely home! It feels so spacious and airy. Love the bathroom, so big and bright. And the couple seems so nice. They certainly don't look like they are married 30 years with 3 adult kids. Also, their juice stand. Completely amazing!
the more I watch this channel the more I love this tiny house concept...living simple is the best
Essa é enorme. .muito bom gosto.
My perfect life! Soon.
EXCELLENT BATHROOM!!! One of the best tiny houses I've ever seen! Even the bedroom doesn't seem claustrophobic. Excellent, just phenomenally excellent!
One of the most beautiful homes you've shown! I love the folding front doors, the large bathroom, the overall space they've found in a tiny home.
美國這種 迷你屋很多我希望美國人來我們台灣做這種迷你屋 我相信台灣人會喜歡的因為台灣的土地越來越貴的 希望美國人來我們台灣做這種迷你屋歡迎
What a lovely couple, & they seem like true partners. Having a good sense of humour helps, I’m sure.  Congratulations on your lovely home & life.
What kind of dogs are those?
01:24 02:01 03:27 03:37  04:21  06:21-- 07:121
My family owns 10 acres,  we need to make a tiny house😩😩
My favorite, hands down - this lovely couple have it going on.....laundry?
I’m always looking for a friend who has a lot of land now. 1) need rich friends for land, 2) 60-80 thousand dollar budget, 3) A pet or two, 4) Exceptional origami skills, 5) have Bryce approve of your crib.
Not to be cliche but living there, wide open doors... bugs? Snakes? Spiders? No?
Beautiful!
If this had a second loft it would be perfect !
When the tiny house bathroom and kitchen is bigger then my regular house kitchen and bathroom lol ! Even the living room is maybe close to the same size
"How big is this tiny house?" 😊😊😊
Amazing , just amazing for that cost for such a dope tiny , Bryce your channel is gold during this quarantine!
I love this one! I love the couple too! I love how they finish each other’s sentences.
Love this show -- so well done. It would be great to see a followup of this particular couple/home.
These 2 are lovely, I bet they are fun to hangout with that is a life goal right there. The house is great, I wonder how they are doing now?
I love it it's beautiful so beautiful I want one
These people are remarkable. Pure example of doing what you want!
Couldn't be a better time to live in a tiny house in the middle of nowhere
55k GBP or AUD?
Where do they eat?
59000 what fiat currency? AUS $ or US $?
Bryce is so HOT....
My 10 year old and myself love all your videos. Thank you for taking the time and creating these shorts.
This is not a tiny house
I pray for their good health & good life. Their realization is beyond measure
This video has been a major help as a guide to hopefully build my own tiny home! Thanks
Wow, heaven...
I wanna Know what they put in those juices . Beautiful home. I like this couple
They are too freaking young to be empty nesters!! I'm older than them and my kids haven't even finished high school yet!! I need to pick up the pace. Damn!!
Been binge watching this channel and I really love how their accent enunciate "big deck"... and i notice the wives on these videos always say "i love the big deck" 😉 sounds naughty
My wife and I would love to live like this but can’t afford two places
His beginning speech was exactly why I've been preparing for a bus or tiny build since my kido is now a adult  and I've  getting ready to to move out  Her mom would have been so proud of us both 🙏🏻 be blessed to all
Congrats!!  Both you and your house are an inspiration.  Best of luck with whatever comes your way!
This is a beautiful and comfortable tiny. Love this couple, and their little dogs are sweet too. 😊💖
this is probably one of the best looking and most comfortable tiny house i’ve ever seen!
Such a beautiful place! And I love those dogs! They say people start to look like their dogs ...
They must,be together since age 15 if they are married 30years. They,look soo  soo Well healthy living. Amazing couple ❤️💕💗for got to add lovely luxury home love ❤️ it ❤️💕
this is probably one of the only tiny houses I'd see myself living in... it looks so comfy and spacious <3 and the bathroom is bigger than the one I have in my "regular" sized house ahah
This tiny house is spacious and comfortable. What a wonderful home that reflects the precious couple who built it. All the best to them.
This might be the best ive seen.
I want to go tiny sooo bad. Soon I hope. Then to decide where & what look I want. I can’t decide. You’ve shown so many homes, I can’t make up my mind.
I am an admirer of this show, and I am thinking very seriously about starting my project, the problem is that I live in Phoenix Arizona, the heat is the most serious of my doubts if it is convenient .... someone in Arizona has tried, some  project like that ...?
Great couple, great home.  I hope they're safe from the bush fires.  There's only two things I'd tweak, 1.) add a regular wood railing on the wall leading up to the bedroom, and 2.) add a railing around the outside deck.  Your current set up is just too low and unsafe.  Great interview once again Bryce.
Love the home and this couple are so sweet.
The way they pronounce Deck...lol
Now I'm wondering if their property survived the horrendous fires in Australia?  I pray so.
Best of all I saw! Simplicity and cpace! Nothing extra...
Bryce is indeed great interviewer . I adore the couple for their hardwork . superb bathroom and definition of Joy
1:11 ok am i the only one who hear him say dick?
I love all of the houses that have the large doors that they can open up to increase their living space, but vertically none of them has a way to keep bugs and insects out. It’s easy to create a removable screen/curtain on the inside that slides into a track above the doorframe and attaches to the metal frame with magnets along the sides and bottom. You can create a split in the screen that closes within magnets to allow you to go in and out while keeping the bugs and other unwanted things outside. Now if there is a place that doesn’t have any bugs and things you don’t want to share your living space with I would love to know where it is because I can’t go outside without being stung or bitten when the temperature gets above 60 degrees Fahrenheit.
"They have a lovely big dick"
Brits got away from our crappy weather and workaholic lifestyles in the UK......though I hope they didn't burn in the bush fires.
Lovely
Canabis is very damaging to the developing brain and no child should touch it.
that is a home i would love to live in, me and my husband are also empty nesters and are debt free and i would love to do something like that, but my husband would and does not want to do something like that. I believe if he would try it for a while he would come to really love it.  My husband is a very big man, 6 foot 5 feet and needs a lot of room he says, he is not fat just a big huge man.  like a big foot ball player type. so if we did do something like that it would be not so much tiny home but a small home. lol. you know what i mean. lmbo!!  he says he needs room to move. lol
Love this home....Well done...
I'm in love with how spacious and comfortable this house is. I like the fact its off grid as well
Lovely place... folks don’t seem to be concerned about flies/insects... big open door, no screens!
Please do a follow up.  I want to know that these folks are OK and that they were unscathed from the so-called wild fires.
Love this tiny house.
Kerennyaaa ini rumah kepengennn kaya gni ..apalagi aku belum punya anak cocok banget ni...
They are do sweet & precious. Love them🎶💞🌻🌞🐕!!! Love the openness of the house. Wonderful 💑 couple!!! Beautiful bathroom, kitchen , living space, well the whole house is so comfy. Everything in it says "feel comfy here!" Wonderful!!!
Definitely in the top 10 of nicest bathrooms in a tiny house.
Well I've been watching tiny house for a while now but I really love is that all the space ur giving in a tiny home. I live in the city but recently it's my first time living in the city but I've experienced the worst with in my time of living here. I moved here 2 years ago from the country thinking I can make a better change for me and my kids always living in the country. But I'm like it cant b that bad. But it was. I was a manager at wendy's when walking home I was beat raped and almost killed walking home from work I lost my job and place to stay cause I was scared of coming home the man is now facing life in prison and I just had a baby and is now living in a small place in a batter women shelter with my new bird but moving from Asheville nc this is not in my care of nature if I had helpni could live my tiny big dream. But my problem is I never lived in the city before so this life I'm scared of. But if I had a tiny home I would love for it to b into the trees in nature I love to hammock but being in the hood people thing I'm weird cause I'm not from the same cloth they were raised from. But tiny house is so awsome to me cause I'm like if they had more help I could b more independent. The winner is becoming successful to become living cheaper. But how do u do that being  a single mother that cant afford housing like me waiting list is like 4 to 5 yrs long. I'm starting to believe that there is no way out that's a single mother I feel like a failure It's Hard Out Here when you make below minimum wage but if I did have a tiny house AP affordable for me and I can actually be a single mom without having to deal with the abuse of the baby daddy's just because I need a roof over our heads so it feels like I'm taking on the abuse just to have a stable home for us but if I was from here it be no problem to have help but I'm clueless and living in a state I really never lived in before especially your City on top of that I'm a Country Girl
Just love this couple and their humour! They sound like good people to be around and their tiny house is a real beauty!
How is this home so spacious?! It’s wonderful, hope they have come through the fires intact.
This is the best example of a tiny house I’ve seen, I would only imagine spending 50k on a house and then having NO bills, being completely off the grid. Just amazing
Love this build & these to seem like such a lovely couple <3 Amazing all the best for the future!!!
No rent for land? Did they buy land?
Nice Tattoo Kev; I just got back from Thailand, I'm considering building a container tattoo studio out here in NYC but was intrigued by all the land in Thailand to build the same.....who wants to help this artist get off the ground? ( i guess it doesnt hurt to ask)🤷🏽‍♂️
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Th see two are amazing!!!
Amazing!!
Shouldn't burn cones. they create creosote and can cause a chimney fire.
Bryce, have you heard if any of these tiny home owners have been affected by the wild fires? They’ve been on my mind quite often. Keeping them and all of Australia in my prayers.
How is safety guaranteed in these isolated places??
Such a lovely couple.
I live in India. Here housing options are so different. People either own huge villas or a smallest small home. Hope a cost efficient tiny house movement happens in my country too. This would help many people save EMIs for years & years.And Bryce your videos not just help spread this movement...but also cure depression .In some way it has that effect ❤️ People when they talk about their journey & motivation behind creating these projects ...they exude such a nice vibe.U r d best interviewer ever!! Love you Bryce!! Thanks for sharing these ❤️❤️
Hope this home is safe from the fires
1:10 a lovely big WHAT now?
Illl start my tiny house any time soon!!! I'm addicted to these videos!!! And I've been always addicted to savings and being debt free!!! Happy life!!!!
Thts th way v hv to live our lives ..awsm home natural breathtaking views..fresh air. So much fre time lil stress  thx fr inspiring 👍
I am architect so I do like the houses but😭 I know this men has a women in his life and I am Muslim anyway I can't have a relationship with him love one I mean but I like him 😭 very much ❤️ imagine beautiful houses and sexy boy 😥😥😥 toooooo much for me
Very nice couple , the house is great !! From Germany with love !! 💚
🇬🇧    I'm viewiing 14 months later and am wondering if it still exists or have the fires flashed over this and other tiny houses. 🌨🌨🌨🌨🌨🌨🌨🌨🌨🌨🌨
With all the fires in Australia I wonder about all of these people living in the forest in their tiny homes. I need updates on everyone. I feel so attached.
Did this tiny house survive the wildfire?
Such an amazing couple!! Thank you for sharing
How can anyone unlike this beauty?! 🤯
54k including 9 grand of solar. That sounds too good.
cute couple
What a beautiful happy couple!!
how is this all with the fires
This couple is awesome! 😊
Tiny house rule #1: dont watch tv
I think this was my favorite episode of all. Love the couple and their personalities. The home is the perfect size and just gorgeous. Love their lifestyle change. Very inspirational. I’d love to see a follow-up episode on this tiny house family. Thank you for sharing!
This does look like a house of mature adults. Gorgeous!
Nice series but most people in those reportages live in their tiny house since a short time (4 weeks here).
I love it, as always, so spacious, nice finishing, and its solar powered 👍🏼
I think this tiny house is the best one I've seen so far I lived the what they did this space is incredible best ever
Thus is my favorite build I’ve seen yet! And the couple is amazing also. What a good team!
What a lovely couple and what a lovely house
Wonderful home and life style. Thanks again for post
The size of this house feels a bit wider rather than the orher tinny house?  The amazing thing is they looking for money on the week end and enjoy life at home on the working days!!
I could comfortable live there
Super spacious
Love this 🏡
LOVE IT!!!
that guy's beard is the sickest I've ever seen
Of course your home heats up, its painted in black💀
Their accent is legit.
6:50 what kind of dogs are they? please tell me
A good looking couple who laughs a lot❤️👏🏾👏🏾
GORGEOUS ✅👍🏻
good couple
Best one best couple best house. Im jeleous
I guess the hardest part would be to find a piece of land like that, and unless it's yours the thought of being forced to move do to the land being purchased must be kind of unsettling.
I love how high the ceiling in the bedroom is. The house is beautiful.😍
Nature is beautiful during daytime but when it's dark nature becomes mysterious and scary. I don't know how these people survive without anybody else in the vicinity and ain't they  scared ? A single look to the dark 🌲 in the night can give real goosebumps.
Very nice house
Lmao who tf disliking this video
Nicely done! I was just wondering if they have a washing machine/dryer? I didn’t know if i just missed it or if they don’t actually have them in their tiny house.
Hi I think your video is very good Please support me through the channel Have a nice day
the windows at the sleeping loft are really nice ,. never think I saw that before in tiny houses,
I love big decks
How does the Aussie $ compare to the US $?  And how can we get plans for these  homes?  I see such great ideas, would love to start planning my own.
Ever notice that almost no one who is featured in these had to pay for the land? Much of the cost of a house is the land to put it on.
this is such an amazing tiny house😍😍😍 so much space!!!!!! i want one😩😩
My favorite tiny home so far. Gorgeous! I will be stealing many of your ideas when I build mine. Thank you.
Enjoy your beautiful home and familie.
lee child's night school
Thank me later 1:12
Of all the tiny houses and lifestyles I’ve seen on this channel, yours is my favorite. Cheers and much love!
Cant wait to get hands on of making my own tiny home. This is inspiring. 😍🥰
I like your video I wish maed tiny home
This is one of the best builds I've seen. I would love to see the floor plans for it!
Really unique 😉
Really was a breath of fresh air watching this one. Good onya Kev and Jan. What an awesome lifestyle. Freedom to work and live as you please. You have some good quality mates that have helped you out with the land there. Bloody awesome to hear your story 😎
I think this is the most inspiring tiny house video that I've ever seen - I love the whole thing, including the job! :)
propane mini split, problem solved
The huge door is cool, it also takes up a lot of space.  You cant pit another along that wall the way you could with a normal door/picture window
This place is huge
That couch is pretty nice
I want to try one of their smoothies. Cute couple beautiful home.
Great house
30 years? They must have married when they were 12, they look great! What a LOVELY couple! They live together, work together, built a tiny house together... and they're STILL married! Now that's true love! Wonderful little home, love the work caravan -- I wish them continued blessings in their life!
The man literally looks like Ra's Al Ghul when he's retired from destroying Gotham.
That couple looks way too young to have been married 30 years!  Beautiful home, deck, and view!
What kind of dogs are those?
Ahahaha love this REALISTIC perspective of a stressful build. Such Brits 😂
I really LIKE this house!!!  The open sliding doors got me... im stealing that idea~
I love this house
I never hear anything about bugs.   Are there not a lot of bugs in Australia?   Those beautiful doors open to that gorgeous view and also let a ton of bugs in the house
This is definitely one of my favorites, but I was extremely amused with how many priorities they had..  Bryce: “That’s a large sofa!” Jan: “A big sofa was one of our priorities...” Bryce: “And this is a large kitchen for a tiny house.” Jan: “A larger kitchen was one of the priorities for us...” Bryce: “And that’s the bathroom behind you, yes? That’s a pretty big bathroom!” Jan: “Well, a big bathroom was a priority for us..”  Like... if you can only “prioritize” so much before it’s a standard-size house!😅🤣
I love your love!
I love your home!
Love this house and everything about it, but i would have made the outside deck wider for entertaining and eating outside as it's a bit too narrow IMO for a decent size table and chairs.
Couple goals
The fact that they’re off Monday-Friday really makes me want my tiny house right now
My friends need to step it up. Not one of them owns a forest
Where is the Washing Machine. Beautiful Tiny Home
I am a total fan of your channel. You're the nicest, nicest chap!   My ONLY 2 discomforting feels when I watch are that (i) it gets a bit boring when you ask the same Q in the same way, every single time. I get that there's a lot of repeats (unless you encourage folk to talk tech or design choices/mistakes along the way/ legal and material and lifestyle change stuff); I how you do try to get folks' stories, but it's getting tedious. (ii) I thought you'd relax a bit more over time in front of the camera and whilst interviewing folk. Unfortunately the technical shifts needed to make something sound sincere and spontaneous aren't always at play. In overdramatising your vocal patterns, the camera thinks it's a theatrical product. In humblest terms, and to give you a little performance feedback, your voice tone still sound "tight", (breathing and vocal yoga are some devices used by actors/presenters to loosen stressed or tight vocal chords). It seems that very often there's no natural rhythm in your utterances. By this I mean that if you analyse the utterance wave lengths and intervals your utterance pattern doesn't segue or reciprocate smoothly with your mutual conversation partners (pattern-matching the other person).  In my "discomfort" I perceive a "nervousness" signal deduced only because you've made use as an actor of a certain utterance speed, script, and vid design which together, when combined with tightly held physical body movements, lend themselves to a "feel" that you're not communicating in a state of naturalness, of ease.   It comes across as if you're reading from a script, and therefore after several vlogs, it's just inauthentic/structured so tightly it gives a too practised and seemingly insincere texture. Except you ARE NOT insincere.   After thinking through my discomforts, I put it down to the deployment of acting techniques you've become stuck in.   Very few people have done, so generously, respectfully, passionately and decently as much in promoting for the tiny home movement as you continue to; there are a handful of folk worldwide with your technical and creative and environmental knowledge. You are a treasure.  What about a slight shift in presentation, combined with a content and vlog design tweak? One in which you provide us with comparative technical and design info during a vid. It will affirm the individual creativity and experiences of the tiny home owner, and at the same time give us more understanding of the practicalities.  For instance, including progress photos, as well as design and team work solutions that particular home owner experienced and resolved would reveal to us the bones of the creative endeavour.   Please forgive me if my feedback seems over-personal. It's meant on a technical level only. Warmest, Meg
1:12 did u hear that?
Your home is beautiful!
What a beautiful couple!!
Was this house built on sight?
Wow, great living, great business, thank you for the ideas 💡❤️😇🙏
What a lovely couple!  Been binge watching this channel, and I love that Bryce stays so enthusiastic!
This is such lovely and spacious home. Doesnt feel like a tiny home at all.
That’s one of the most shit views I’ve ever seen. Yikes.
Gorgeous home and I love how its built, spacious, tastefully decorated, light and airy for a tiny house.  I also love the decking where you can pull back the doors extending the indoors out.  Sit having your dinner taking in the view or relaxing on the decking with a glass of wine!  Excellent!
OMG! I love how you can just open the front wall, like that! I'd sleep right there! ♥️
Beautiful home and a lovely couple
Beautiful!
Definitely one of my favorite tiny homes! That accordian door is awesome.
Almost every show I watch of Living Big, it’s raining, or just finished raining.  That’s .... umm ... hum.
Do none of these people have to deal with bugs?  I always wonder how they deal with the gnats and flies and ants  lol.  Beautiful home and beautiful place.
I love them
Where I live you’d need screen windows and doors and a screen porch. Why are all these tiny houses built where no mosquitoes and flies  or snakes and small mammals?
The door! 😍
Gorgeous and super spacious tiny house! Two vanities too 😁
Love the bathroom setup! How clever
I love your house and set up. It is just the best! Great design and perfect size!
Now this is one tiny home I would live in! Love it❣️
WOW !  This is a tiny home, where I could live quite happily, it's beautiful and cost so little. They could easily build and sell more, when they aren't travelling.
what about the security of tiving isolated? do not have fear of the thieves?
The nicest tiny house I’ve ever seen. They did a great job and at a great price. Love the style.
They are so sweet together. I guess laughter is the key to marriage longevity.
does anyone know what type of dogs they have :((( so cute
Love this one!
This is so amazing. So spacious and beautiful.....a dream
Lovely home and the bathroom is the best feature!
Stunning home
How close are you to your laundry site?
Is no one gonna ask where these people throw their trash
BEAUTIFUL HOME!  BEAUTIFUL COUPLE!  LOVE THIS ONE BRYCE!!!
One of the most beautiful spacious homes I've ever seen!  Love all the warm wood tones with the cool grays and aqua colors and the simplicity of it all! Love the wood burning stove and those pillows on the couch look Scandinavian and look like they're from where else? Ikea? The bathroom is gorgeous, just wish there was a tub there and not just a shower!  Beautiful home and lifestyle, very smart , creative couple! The way to live instead of in the rat race, commuting and working in the corporate world like I use to do! Now, I also live simply and by the sea! We all have options, some healthier than others in the long run! Thanks for sharing~
This is the one I find the most appealing, most tiny houses feel a bit cramped to me but this one is so beautifully open en spacious. The interior design is amazing!
I love this tiny house,  but here in Germany we have so many regulations. I hope that it will be easier one day to find a place where it's allowed to place a tiny house
Have fun...nice people!
_I'm 38 now.... Someday in the future this is what I'm gonna do_
You guys are awesome. I long for this.
Super curious about how people in Australia and specifically Queensland navigate local laws when living full time in a tiny house on wheels. A lot of the gov laws indicate that it's illegal / must have foundation / sewerage / be on land with an existing dwelling. Anyone know of a website with a breakdown of how to navigate?
Amazing! Cute dogs too!!
That’s a comfortable sofa!
This is one of my favourites.
Absolutely love this design
My fave build so far. Perfection.
I love that they used a normal sofa in the living area! Exactly what I plan to do in my tiny house dream!
No mention of the framing. I would think that the choice of framing materials would vary depending on the climate. Weight would also be a factor. Would like to see more on the choices of building materials and their pros and cons. Great build in this video.
This is such a charming life style
love this Home
This IS the dream life to me!
What a lovely house ,not to mention people that live on there.
PLans to share or buy?
What a lovely couple and their home! 🌹
Bravo!  With the vintage juice bar AND off grid:  Best one yet!
VxA=total Watt Each 100 amphere x 4 panel = 400 400x12 = 4800 Watt/hours 4800x80% = 3840 Watt maksimal for use. Enought. Hehehe.
I so love this couple too sweet, wish u guys all the best an then some, beautiful an comfortable home. Enjoy.👍😍
со стороны кажется как будто два любовника сняли домик в лесу на пару дней)))
Really beautiful
Beautiful tiny love that they did it together. You can feel their love for each other.
🙀AWESOME HOUSE!!! My husband &'I have been married for 30 years like this couple & they have given us the idea to make this jump by doing most of the building ourselves as they did. What a home they have built; & they don't act as if they had to sacrifice much to move into this "tiny home"! The sliding doors on this house are phenomenal!! I can't imagine the view they have with the doors open or closed. I adore this home!! The height of this unique home is exactly what I want & I don't feel like the roof is lying over your heads. You guys have inspired us!! Thanks for sharing!!!
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
amazing couple
Yeah, my flat is actually 32m2 😂 I mean it's small but I never though about it as too small, or tiny or anything, there was no need to compromise I even have a pantry of 2m2. Everything is full size. I don't get it :D why it looks so small when THEY are doing it? I can dance around here and I have no loft I'm confused 😅
Out of all the episodes I've watched on this channel, this is my favourite. Such a 'big' tiny home, with a beautiful view and space maximisation within.
Love this. No more to say.
Wow that’s one sophisticated tiny house !!
This is such a lovely couple and their tiny house, oh WOW, just beautiful! What an incredible way to live! I wish them years of happiness! BTW, binge watching these videos for the second time!
Wow! Love it.
I really like her vibe. It's so positive
Bello hogar,por favor podrían poner subtítulo.gracias
they are such a beautiful, beautiful couple, makes me sooo happy to see them. they are the cutest people ive seen
Love there big tiny house ❤️
Love this couple they're so positive! Love their home it's humble modern & fresh! 😘
July 2019  Everyone should watch this video to learn about living off-the-grid.  This video could be used in a trades course for teaching purposes.  Every dog rescue group should watch this video to see how happy their two dogs are in this Tiny House.  7 billion of these in high rise buildings in every city around the world could help save 7 billion dogs (and their guardians).  Richard Gage of 'Architects and Engineers for 9 ll Truth' and 'Firefighters for 9 ll Truth' should be paid to make sure every high rise is as safe as possible.  All first responders (including veterinarians and vet techs should be allowed to live in these buildings for free, including their extended family and circle of friends.  This could help make every city safer for people and pets to live in or commute through for EVERYONE.  The buildings should be called 'Doris Day Memorial Dog Park Building's or 'Steve Allen Memorial Building' (he invented the Tonight Show, he traveled rough in his teens) instead of 'Section 8' because that is a military term translating into 'worthless people.'  The Super Rich should pay for all of this, like Peter Thiel of PayPal, Tim Cook of Apple; Harvey Weinstein, Jeffrey Epstein.  They all could easily pay for all of this in every city around the world for 7 billion people.  The human population doubles about every forty years so this number is not too big.
Theses two take the prize!  Not only did they build a stylish home, but it's off the grid.  Their lifestyle/work also gives them the freedom to enjoy it.  Most often with tiny homes there is compromise but these people got it all and then some.
What a beautiful home. I love the kitchen because I love to cook. The doggies are so precious!
This channel is the reason why I'm late for work every day ! And here's another beautiful breathtaking home in a lovely country with awesome people. !!
this is one of the best episodes yet...even though I watched the poms smash us out of the world cup of cricket last night........best of luck for the final but I have a feeling that Bryce may be hoping that England doesn't do so well!!! Oh, PS. This was just a bit of light hearted banter that I'm sure any Kiwi, Aussie, Pommie sports fan would understand......the tiny house was absolutely amazing...well done
Not long found this tiny house community, and I am in LOVE. Everyone’s houses are amazing in their own ways, but this couple has defined it for me!
what a great couple
beautiful home and very spacious too !  What a fantastic idea that a husband and wife would actually want to spend time together and I love how they saw what they needed to make for meeting their commitments to spend time with each other and the ones they love - and they found something they both enjoyed doing plus allowed them to make a healthy lifestyle for themselves while working 2 days and off 5.  That is how life should be and people would actually enjoy it so much more.  Thank you for another awesome video !
wait. did they get married at like 10? they look great for their age!
My kind of place because of da kitchen sink
Kids grow up and leave home? What a concept! I'm still waiting.
Tiny houses are just usual houses but with more respect towards minimalism and aesthetics 👌🏻🙌
Шикарный домик!
What about laundry?  That's always my first concern.
I really love to watch tiny house video but this is the first where I could really imagine myself living in. This is inspiring!
From an Aussie, It's in Australia but they're actually British. That is not an Aussie accent! Anyway lol nice happy couple with a nice house 🙂
Life goals!!!
Love their lifestyle! Gorgeous home!
Gorgeous!  So tasteful!
the house is fantastic, but.... the dogs are the best! wow I am in love with these puppies :) are they cairn terriers? anyone knows?
Admire the courage and determination of the self builders...they built themselves a very elegant and beautiful home...
What i learned from tiny houses is that they have bought famlies and loved ones more closer... Tiny House filled with love of people.
I love your home.  Fantastic job. Enjoy your journey.
LOVE THE SPACE, OPEN FLOOR PLAN & LAY OUT OF THIS HOUSE🏆 The price is GREAT  Only thing I'd do is ADD more closet storage space & clear off more land.
These people are really lovely. I'm wondering where they're from, though, because they sound like they're from the UK.
one of the few tiny house's I actually liked very well planned out.
I am so inspired by this tiny house! What a great couple and house design. Love the beautiful kitchen and open concept and huge gorgeous bathroom!
The important of time!
Awesome couple and home!
Absolutely stunning home, lovely couple and Bryce, you really are a gentleman :-)
Question: do they have laundry appliances?
Awesome ❤️
One of the prettiest homes so far!  It's so open and beautifully appointed.  Wishing this lovely, hard working couple all the best!!!
Incredibly amazing about their life, and leading loneliest life spending together at this age in fabulous
Soooo ... it's a HOW, not a THOW? Haha. the term *"tiny* house on wheels" surely has its limits, when a house on wheels is bigger than a modest apartment or granny flat. LOVE their sofa, though. Makes the loungeroom so house-like.
I love this tiny house! Great job folks.
why is there a legal limit for the height of the houses?
NOW THIS IS AN AWESOME TINY HOUSE!!!  Love it!
hey bro..you are the best. ........I m from India
Hu I wonder if they'll eventually hook up the grey water tank to do the clothes washing, instead of watering the garden?
How does the moisture affect you? The cool of AC with heat makes moisture behind panels and ceiling covers and turns into mold and mildew
Another comment made me realize a cost/price wasn’t ever given. I’m sure their copious sweat equity paid off. KUDOS to handling that metal framing on a mobile base and everything else they accomplished.
I love their home... but honestly can't stop starting at them wondering how the heck they're not ages in their 30's! Can't believe they've been married for 30 years! Wow good DNA lol
😍🥰❤️🥰😍
Que bella yo quiero una , cuánto sale más o Menos ?
7.5 for a smothie wthell
Ok I'm sorry but I have to say It. Lovely Big Dick lol
It’s all about the notoriety, the cost of delivery and construction is about the same of buying an established and renovating?? It would be interesting how they are living 6 yrs on ??? , of your not into self build then it’s not worth your it
Tiny living is so over priced !! I have researched 😃
I love your lifestyle..god bless you both..😇
This house may push my husband to my way of thinking..lol  Y'all cross your fingers for me please. We have a total of 4 yrs and both kids will be grown ups. And we will be able to really get a plan together for when he retires to do just exactly what we want to do.🙏🙏
Thank you for bringing this home and it’s owners to our attention, as a fellow Aussie it’s fantastic to others in my home country and their stories
LOVE THE REAL COUCH!! I REALLY HATE THE BUILT-IN BENCHES EVERYONE PUTS IN THEY LOOK AND IM SURE ARE UNCOMFORTABLE!! IT JUST MAKES IT MORE HOMEY TO HAVE REAL PIECES OF FURNITURE THAT ARE COMFORTABLE!! MOST TINY HOUSES ARE BASICALLY A KITCHEN ON WHEELS!! I DONT GET THE LARGE SIZE APPLIANCES YOUR IN A TINY HOUSE IT LOOKS RIDICULOUS!! CAN YOU ALSO TELL US AMERICANS HOW LONG AND WIDE THE HOUSES ARE IN INCHES!!
Amazing house! wow
Great video. We would love to to do this when our 5 children move out one day.
Love this! perfect for 2 people and great for 1!!
Love your Home
Thanks a lot for sharing ! This is how life should be ... minimalist , relaxing , peaceful, and enjoyable. Pure bliss !
Realmente hermosa!
OMG, SO FAR MY FAVORITE HOUSE AND COUPLE! TOTALLY GOALS 💖😍
This tiny house really looks and feel spacious
12:35 hmmmmm :p
this one has to be my all-time favorite. A beautiful house with everything they need; managed to keep the whole thing low-budget; No rent; Kids left the nest and now it's all about enjoying every bit of time left on this planet. GOALS
GREAT JOB FOR THE COST, TWO STRONG PERSONALITIES WITH A SENSE OF HUMOR THAT KEEPS THEM STRONG, HAVE FUN, LOVE THE DOGS.
They must really love eachother. My second wife and I about divorced over puttting siding on a kitchen addition.  lol inevitably the divorce happened anyway. Woop woop.  😁😁
My new life goal: Use all my water twice
this couple is so fun to watch!
Thank you very much for sharing this wonderful video 🙏 God bless you 🤗 always
3 adult children? They look great regardless of whatever age they might be!
One of the top 5 best of 2019 so far. Just perfection.
❤
Wow I was wondering why the guy looked so healthy... It's cause he works selling healthy juice.
GMILF
This is my dream....with my lover
Its a great idea for a decent living without any extravangant cost. Its perfect. Well done couples and very amazing. I was wondering why third world countries cannot do it rather than shanty house, perhaps it's laziness. Indeed congratulation to both couple.
Really amazing
God..... They are soo great couple.... N to friendly with each other.... 😘
Love love love !!!!! Love the wood with the black 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
How do they use their grey water to water the plants? Are they using all organic soaps and detergents? Hope I got that right lol
so happy for this lovely couple.
I cant imagine in the night.. it must be very quite there.
If they use more electricity that the solar panels can provide, why not add a few more panels? I have zero knowledge about this, so if I don't know what I'm talking about. So, I'm perfectly willing to listen. But, it looks like the roof has plenty of more space to add one (probably two) more panels of the same size, so why not? Is it price? Space? Again, I don't know, I'm genuinely asking.
What a lovely couple and home. They are full of energy and happiness! Love the bathroom. I never see a bathroom in a tiny house that big before.
well the house is bigger than mine
I noticed they said that they did it by themselves. I never heard them say that they have experience in construction. I must say this is a really really beautiful layout I've seen some that look like a shead. But this one looks really nice, homey and very contemporary.
I loved the bathroom, it's great that include the clothes there
you can definitely feel how in love they both are!
I love the music it's so refreshing and speaks to my soul everytime
Im sorry, this tiny house isnt tiny at all
im obsessed w the high ceilings, it makes the tiny houses big amd spacious
this was very impressive, lovely
I’m loving these homes , thinking about doing it
adorable couple..a tiny house in a great  place .God bless
British people... the first! Brilliant, we’re 30yrs married next year and we are downsizing too!   I would love a tiny but hubby says no and in England probably not the best place 😃 But I’m showing him this house for sure. I absolutely love this 💕💕💕
DEFINITELY, ONE OF FAVORITES!
Interviewee said at 1:13 "Lovely big dick" 😅
This is my DREAM HOME❤️ TINY but SPACIOUS , what a stunning BATHROOM (largest I saw till now for tiny house) and the BED too was spacious . Beautiful people Beautiful home and living ❤️❤️❤️
It's house on wheel that means it is meant to move..so what happens to the deck and the water tank!?
I don't know if it's the presenter the one writing the end notes for each episode, but who ever it is they're doing a fantastic job wrapping up each episode in an inspiring articulate way  :)
I am obsessed over the amount of crazy detailing within a tiny house. I hope I will have my own, someday. These two are an amazing couple.
Notice how all the guys in these videos are shorter than their wives lol.
Such a cool people!
Stunning !!  I am literally converted 😊
One of my favorites!!
Beautiful! Great to see some Brits on the show. Power to them
I just completely love this house.
🤚🏼👊🏼😃❤️ Very cool! I love the colors and the layout of this tiny house. Awesome work 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 Namaste 🙏🏼☮️
that deck
I love the space especially the door that wides open the living room.. The house doesn't looked tiny at all.
Hello from moscow, +1  like
Nice build, nice life!
What is a breed of dog?
BEAUTIFULLY DONE !!!                   LOVE IT !
That's about the size of a small yacht, interesting how different people do things differently, it would actually be quite an interesting comparison cost wise between a sailing boat purchase and refit and a trailer home build, bearing in mind you still need a good sized truck/4×4 to pull it, any form of self sustainable off grid living is a really good option
Love this couple, their lifestyle and their tiny house.
1:10 lovely big dick?
1:12 Big Dick
I love how that door opens up.
Dangg he looks like conor mcgragor..
The house is lovely, the couple cute but..........the property is ugly!   Plant some shrubs and flowers.
So dumb there is restrictions imposed on what how they make their house on their own private property that is not even part of some neighborhood, so much for freedom. Awesome house though, id live there in a heartbeat.
What a lovely couple (from the UK too - lucky buggers living in Oz) and the house is amazing. You’re both an inspiration. Those ceiling fans are amazing... what brand are they? Love the interior design and style.
I soooo love this design!!!
I probably watched all your videos. And this is one of my favorites.
I am so childish... I had a mouthfull of tea when they said deck with the accent.
Love this one and it's in my region.  Just realised I've actually bought a juice from their juice van. Lol
Nicely done
Is bryce an architect or something??
i love their house!
Kev, I'm right there with you on the importance of toast.   Love this house, such a charming couple!
i luv this house so much
Wow! I Love you both guys!🙏😍
I think what is really important in a home tiny or big is the restroom bathroom and this one having such a huge one is really spectacular ♡⃛◟( ˊ̱˂˃ˋ̱ )◞⸜₍ ˍ́˱˲ˍ̀ ₎⸝◟( ˊ̱˂˃ˋ̱ )◞♡⃛
They build it all by themselves \(-ㅂ-)/ ♥ ♥ ♥ good
This is amazing! What a beautiful home and place to live. Those dogs are really adorable. Didn't even bark once.
now that is the kind of size i could see myself in for the rest of my life...no offence to the really tiny homes on trailers, but i could never live in such a cramped space forever - even if it were legal in my country - but this? just perfect! spacious without going overboard
How do you power a fridge and other electrical devices (like charging a phone) when you’re off grid? Do the sockets link to the batteries?
LMAO kids leaving home in 2019
Love it!
Lovely story
Am sorry but i lived in a camper the ones that connect to the truck & i was like 7 yr old & we lived in it for 7or8 yr & i hated it cause it was so small & now privacy specially when it 4 kids & 2 adults it was the most horrible experience for me i felt homeless & i thinks its good for adults but once you have kids iys not a great idea tgats my thinking cause i lived it
I think this is the best way to live a life and it is necessary to learn their lifestyle with them thankyou
A couple of questions ... how are they going to cope in summer with the mossies and flies??? There's no fly screen on the door entrance, it's going to be hellish. Also, how do they stop their clothes and linens from getting mouldy in the humidity? If the TH is open all the time then the humidity permeates through the house. That's not easy to control.
the guy has a british accent but australian intonation so it sounds like a fake accent lolol
Thank you for sharing nice 👍 build. Love 💕 that bathroom/dressing room/storage,the largest tiny 🏡 ever seen.   lifestyle , business, stresses improvements, outlook beautiful on lifestyle.  congratulations on your 30 years of marriage. Couple looks good (young) for 30 years.  JW Wichita Kansas USA 🇺🇸  E Johnson-Wootson  PO Box 📦 780685 Wichita Kansas  (USA)  67278-0685
This is what I wanna do, I’m 16 and saving up for a car and pc. (I graduated year 10) (work full time) so after I get my car and pc setup complete I’m going to be saving up as much money as I can to build one of these houses on the farm I live on, on 35 acres.
I love that this couple talked about how the couples on this channel and they are totally the epitome of that. 30 years of marriage?! They live and work together? Awe bless them! I love their cute little house and lifestyle.
Bryce is great in the way he talks with the people - always so respectful and he finds something nice to say about a n y t h i n g
Beautiful. Cool couple. Love the house and the lifestyle ...and the dogs!
What a lovely couple. 😊 Love the house and puppies too!🐕🏠💖 Are the doggies Scotties?
Honestly if that house had wifi (doubt it) it'd be my dream home
I LOVE the huge sofa. Too many times tiny houses have those narrow sofas over the wheel well that you can't lay down on or share with a couple of other people.  I also love the color scheme and materials they used for the interior of the house. Its one of my favorites ever!
Amazing job you two. Quality build for sure. Very inspiring. Thanks Bryce.
I know he was saying deck but all I could hear was dick
Anything on permits? Or council requirements? Would love to know
Love it !!!
I love what they said, they do not have to pay any bills, no water, no electricity they can just go and travel. That is the biggest motivation for me. Having something cheap and beautiful and in the end not be tight to the house.
54,000? I've seen smaller places for twice that price.. Well done.
Omg I'm in love with there dogs what breed are they?😍
I love that this is a bigger tiny house. The double vanity in the tiny house is incredible and smart if you’re are living with a partner. The price they paid was soo reasonable especially to have all that off grid capability. I honestly bought he would say it cost more. And side note, 30 years of marriage! Wow. They look so youthful.
Beautiful!
Love the bathroom. That’s the inspiration for our bathroom renovation.
AMAZING!
I want more info on your stove.
So you either need parents with land or friends with land
over indulgent rich people.
Hi Bryce, love your channel! Have you encountered a tinyhome family that for an upright piano into their home?
I love this house and the sweet couple and their cute doggies. 😍😍
Wow what an awesome place. Awesome guys good for you!
I love your house! The quality and design of interior is fabulous ! Especially the bathroom is a dream for women. Great job! Love love love. This house is a hope for simple sustainable lifestyle.
They built a big WHAT?! YAAAAAS!!!!!!
I love the way you have your Front entrance it looks beautiful widen up the living room area I want to your deck it beautiful
Love the bathroom in this house! So big and bright!
What a lovely couple.
A simple fix for the awning would be the use of sailcloth. Simply attach it to the posts and the house with eyelets.
Now my bugs would love those doors.
This is the best youtube channel I've ever come across.. it's really refreshing.. Thank you Bryce ❤😊
That couch made of dead cows really turned me off. Also if the dogs were bought, that is awful as well. Otherwise, nice house, nice views and a nice couple.
Lovely one
We all feet in those acres ! ☺
I love their adorbable Scotty dogs, as well as their very lovely new home!!
Not that tiny of a house compared to other videos I've seen on here
Si think they need a tv so they can watch movies
Very cool house!
I have those exact blue pet bowls for my rabbit’s food and water, they’re ceramic so she can’t knock them over.
I want to make same house in nepal is it possible and how much will cost
they look so happy for 30 years of marriage
nice cozy little house
Love that they have this small business as well.
what was the book the owner was reading in his bedroom area at the end??
The Gold Coast Queensland is a BEAUTIFUL place to live.
Wow, gorgeous tiny home...they did an incredible job with it!
The best part of channels like this is you get so many ideas from other builds. Can't wait to build my own.
i love the size of this tiny house 💕
what kind of Wind Gusts  can this Tiny House sustain...any ideas ??
I’m in Love 😍
Nice!
I need information about how could construct the tiny house India.   Then only this videos on Tiny house information in very useful in India.    If you have any availabily of your technology in India. Please provide the information.  Thank-you.
Oh want this 💚💚💚
A leather couch with the heat and humidity they mentioned..🤔
This is a villa of tiny houses. The wife said a key word in this video: (Time is the most important factor in your life) Nothing will enhance a life once time is gone by.
INSPIRING
Lady! your jokes ....not funny and I notice you love to cut people off with your stupid comments and annoying laugh. Wouldn't be surprised if the husband pushed her down that hill someday.
I admire so much.  Such a cool house
Really great idea.will try for my life.
Absolutely beautiful home.
He looks like Conner McGregor
Anyway to get the plan for this beauty?
how much is a per acre of land by a croc-infested river?
Wow - £54k?? I'm speechless
Marriage goals for sure!! So romantic that they built this house together, went through near breaking points but came up laughing in the end and gave birth to a lovely peaceful and spacious (almost) tiny house. And lets make time for the colour scheme too - very beach-country-cabin-in-the-woods.
Dream lifestyle.
Life with no kids LOL. Very far away in my horizon hahaha
I like the house but it leaves me with questions about security in that place.
Good programme on youtube. Should go on forever.
Another place I like but the setting again makes it, maybe I should look into Australia...
So the dirty shower water full of chemicals is used to water the garden plants?
Queensland? Alternative Cooling? Passive Evaporative Cooling tower not an option? Of course not, too much humidity... or is there?
Has anyone else notice that the majority of the tiny house owners end up on a property owned by a friend or parents. Living on the cheap or actually mooching?
When he said "big deck" i heard something else and i had to double check for a moment
Beautiful tiny house, couple is so independent n confident, luv it. 👍
Watched a few of your videos now, and it's so refreshing to watch someone be genuinely interested in what they are interviewing someone for. Too many people fake these types of videos
I dont think this is a Tiny house.. its even bigger than the normal houses here in Indonesia lol, but I love the DIY and nature concept..
Where’s the laundry?
Im guessing she was in charger of the interior plans
Love u Bryce!
I'd like to know what their fridge is (obv gas) but what size & make is it??
I would absolutely hate thst job
Beautiful home and wow ton's of space.  What a lovely couple as well.  They have a GREAT sense of humor which I am pretty sure helped them through this build LOL.  God bless you all.
This is how life should be lived..
What a genuinely lovely couple ❤️ I admire their honesty and sense of humour and the house is wonderful!  I hope after 30 years of anything I can smile as wide as these two 😁
That's funny there's a legal height limit in the middle of the woods people and their stupid rules . What a beautiful house and a beautiful couple. I really enjoyed the video
Incredible house
One
This is BEAUTIFUL!!!!
Lovely house💖💖
Jan and Kev, mahalo nui for your inspiring story of living as empty nesters! Your story gave me the possibility of living “what matters!”
Such a smart couple.  Beautiful home.
inspiration <3
Thats a bad ass house!!! My dream.
Ikea cushions 😬 as usual I notice the most insignificant details 🤦🏻‍♀️
Very nice house and very nice couple
I just love the ethos of these people and their lifestyle!
30 years of marriage?!! What, were they married at 1. They look so young
Fabulous..
Was there a washer and dryer?
Awesome Power. Couple!👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Adorable pups!
This unit looks wider than normal.
I love watching your videos Bryce--you find really neat tiny houses--the DIYs are so much more homey than stock models--and your interviews are so warm and friendly yet pragmatic also.  Kev and Jan, congratulations on your beautiful home--that's the roomiest bathroom by far I've yet seen in a tiny home!
I'm so jealous - I really want to make my own tiny home - thanks so much for sharing
I should flip my life with theirs..
I want such life. Living in the world is slavery
Can you start asking about the square footage? Perhaps I missed it. 🙊
This Is Such A Wonderful Program Again Bryce...U've Done It Again! Best To U In This New Year With More Wonderful Presentations Like This One!
This guy’s narration is very cheesy at times
I love these, but it really is like an upscale trailer home.
So impressed and inspired by this video. Thanks.
Beautiful💚
I had to bring in all my books.. No.. no.. they’re just a third of your books... 😊 Actually .. I sneaked in a few more ...😬 Ha ha ha.. can totally relate... Much love to the fabulous couple!!   So so proud of you Bryce..  Been your subscriber for over a couple of years now.. to say that I’m so comforted by your videos would be an understatement...  Best part is scrolling through the comments which are so encouraging and uplifting..!!  I truly believe that God put this into you to show the goodness and love which is still existing and flourishing among mankind ... apart from the eco friendly, nature-oriented, innovative, self sufficient, off-the-grid, tiny house revolutionary dream homes...!!!  Keep up the good work and God bless your team more!!
No bills to pay 👍🏽 best part of life, living bill free...and I wonder when will such concepts be implemented in Asian countries.
Love them and their  beautiful tiny house 🏠
Ideally, no city should replace sewer pipes when it rains.  Marin County, California had a city that did this recently (reported on KCBS AM 740 radio is San Francisco, with KPIX 5 TV) the old pipes ruptured and tons of sewage went into the road, creeks, and probably the SF Bay, ocean.  The above could be done everywhere.  It would help Australia now with the extreme drought.  January, 2019
My cratulation you have in very beautiful place and georges tiny house. Wish you good luck in the future
Тhis is one of my favourite designs. Great use of space and really calming colours :)
Best one I’ve seen so far!
nice,,,,now for some Fossicking
Could they add another bedroom legally?
Did he just say Big dick at 1:12 ? hahaha
My only thing is, it has to have a basement and why would they build it on a hill, where a mud slide could happen?
Absolutely perfect like wow 😮 , I’m trying to live exactly like this
deck sounds like dick in nz , mate
Now i want an off grid tiny house 😥😍😍😍
What a great spot! Let me know if you'd like a house sitter while you're on Holiday!
Very spacious for a tiny. I love this house!
Love it!
Love the large size bathroom.  Another well done video. Cheers.
I love this house and the couple also. I’d like to know what breed their dogs are.
😊beautiful 😍home and Nature 💚☀️🌳😊😍Nice and honest people 👍💜❤️
What a beautiful episode.  The whole thing was tranquil like a meditation.  Thank you!
the pipes for the shelfs are brilliant idea! you shoudl go also for beekeping... great house!
Whoah dude, watching your old videos and then suddenly watching this recent one is a hell of a shock. You got buff.
Çok beğendim, harika... insanın ömrü uzar böyle bir yerde.
Fun folks
my favorite one so far.
Beautiful!
Well done
Absolutely awesome...very inspirational.  Thank you for sharing.
Well from the other “tiny” houses, this doesn’t look like a “tiny” house?
Is it weird that I would like to guard up the windows ? I would be a bit of paranoid... Haven't seen a Tiny Home yet with proper safety like fences etc.
Super home, super faimlly
wow a 2 day workweek
This is by far one of my favorite tiny homes! Very beautifully done!! I also enjoyed watching the awesome couple and their dogs! They seem to have a beautiful relationship..☺️
WOW That tiny home was truly brilliant There has been so many tiny homes I myself would love to have Absolutely beautiful places Thank you so much for looking at the beauty in living tiny You are truly amazing
Please don’t show the bathrooms I feel
the best tiny house I have seen so far, have a great life guys, all the best
WOW!  The bathroom is huge!   Probably 3 times as big as ONE of my bathrooms in my single family home.  Well, on top of that, I love it!  I am, as Bryce said "Envious" (shame on me" if I were to believe my upbringing religion"). of their work week (meaning 10 commandments-I think?).  I'm not religious, just spiritual.  Lovely couple also.
What a beautiful little house!! And such a nice couple too. So happy for them that they can enjoy their life and do what they love :)
Been watching a lot of tiny home vids lately.  This is by far the ugliest one.  So much wasted space.
Great job ruining that pristine piece of land. If you really wanted to have a small footprint you'd live in a big city condo. Wankers.
Extremely awesome and two very nice and compatible couple they are truly blessed and lucky
Downsizing America putting the old in high price sheds call it home and make them believe this is the life.
still looks like a modern mini house, not so impressive on the interiors and the touch of furniture and fixture. if i will build my tiny house i will make it sure that i will combine hydrophonics a Zen - like design to make you feel the freshness of the surroundings.
It's cute.  Love the sliding doors.  but my  gosh....she looks scared.  Almost all the way thru it,  she looks scared.  she loves her man,  you can tell ...but she's scared. the place is cute tho
Totally beautiful place.  Awesome couple.  Thanks for sharing.
I’m in love with their home!!!
great home,i hope i will too have
Alot of space wasted...under the bed drawers, on the walls opposite the bed, lounge room ...I wouldnt keep my clothes in the bathroom due to the humidity mould and bugs will destroy everything...I would put in a sprinkler system for bushfires....
Wonderful 💞 💙❤💜💛💚💖
they should pay him some rent...he pays taxes on the land so it is only fair to chip in. good friend
The host is painfully chirpy, i like it when he isn't speaking. He seems incredibly fake and stilted.
lovely couple in a tiny home. congrats to both of you. :)
So Beautiful & cozy tiny house.
Australia, Queensland is beautiful 💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪🍹🍹🍹🍹🍹🍹🍹👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Hey,I enjoy your videos and feel fresh,thanks for sharing beautiful videos....,but a question stuck in ny mind,they live permanent in these house or just have for enjoyment?? And have a big house too? From.pakistan
Beautiful house congatz
This is an amazing build and life. Way to go! Beautiful.
Loved the house and the location is amazing..... Hope to find a life partner to do the same....
They look so youthful and happy
Loved it
Love this couple for being honest about it being tough building just want to say Thank You for that!
Beautiful, but a DIY home, I think not....
This is the most lovely tiny house I’ve ever seen in this channel!!
Wonderful.
What a home!
Holy shit i didnt know connor mcgregor went off the grid
I Love the idea of having the closet in the bathroom! My biggest concern with a loft is getting dressed. My only wonder is if you'd deal with mold in the closet.
I've only now notived that you have 1 million subscribers. A great number but I do believe there should be more poeple sharing the idea of living tiny :) thank you for the video just like always!
Love the deisgn really, not a huge fan of the steel construction since I love working i  wood, over here we also need atleast 150mm outer wall thickness due to our climate, I'd love to build my own tiny house one day, building houses for others is a pleasure in itself but the satisfaction of building your own must be absolutley fantastic, my mothers fsther built the house I live in now and my fsthers morher still live in the house my grandfather built and they are absolutley amazing 😊
멋있네요
How expensive are tiny homes are they in good condition is there water flow? Can I get one? :)
Beautiful!
Nice fire 🔥 place
So cute and stunning!
Super Great
This was a SWEET casa!!! Dig it...
Amazing... please revisit them in 2 or 3years to see what changes (if any) they have made.
I love this!
Awesome home, awesome life!
I love this tiny house design. What about the laundry? Great lifestyle!!
Bryce,  just discovered your channel literally yesterday and am a bit of a fan. This episode the best yet, made particularly so by Jan & Kev, actually living their dream. Not just the house which is actually quite spacious but the business and income also. Also the cost is very realistic, i'm not gonna lie but  i see the cost of most of the container based living spaces as rather unrealistic as better spaces could be created with the same cost but this one is very affordable. You've got a good interview style too. love your work
Luv this channel
Wow!  Love this one
We have that exact same model of oven lol in a regular house though
Very very nice....
One of the best I have seen!
Her closet is twice the size of his I see! lol.
Wow this one is BEAUTIFUL
Fantastic! Gorgeous!💙💚💛🧡💜
I love this house!
I like the size of this and the bathroom is amazing! Although, my plans of a tiny house include a bed on the lower level (and one in the loft) that you can reach without stairs because let face it: I‘m not getting any younger and if I build a tiny house it has to last until the end...
Fascinated with the stairs to the loft. Definitely made a small space look and feel spacious. I like.
I love everything about this house.  It's the most beautiful tiny house ever!
The bathroom is a must have in a tiny home! 😍
It seems so big for a tiny home. Just the essentials and then having to work only 2 days a week, makes it more than worth it.
So without the solar this is 45.000 AUD which comes down to about 31.500 USD. Wow, for a big tiny house like that that's cheap. Shows you just how much doing it yourself makes a difference. In the US there are smaller tiny houses than that that sell for double that price because people are jumping on the train wagon to make a (serious) profit.
Nice home, nice couple - good job!
Nice!!!
Nice
I love how open this place is.
Beautiful people and a house just like them
Awesome house! Interesting bathroom... Wonderful couple! :)
Awesome, great work (work & interview)! i just love these kind of videos. This is always so interesting :)
QUAOO EXCELENTE CASA DESEARIA CON TODA MI ALMA TENER UNA VIVIENDA COMO ESA. SOLO EN LOS PAISES DEL NORTE LAS TIENEN Y BUENO AQUI EN VENEZUELA MUY DIFICIL PARA MI POR LA SITUACION ECONOMICA POR LA QUE ATRAVESAMOS NOS IMPIDE HASTA AHORRAR SOLO PARA COMER SOLO PARA ESO... BESOS Y ABRAZOS TACHIRA VENEZUELA
Love it, good job guys
He said they had been there for 11 years and researched his Channel but his channels first video was 5 years ago
Best one yet! Absolutely love everything about this home.
Easily one of my most favourite tiny houses I've seen!
This is probably my favourite one yet- I too like a comfy place to sit and clothes in the bathroom is such a good idea. The height of the loft is nice too and they must live very near me- I'm assuming gold coast hinterland. Pretty sure I've bought smoothies from them at events around the gold coast!
Thank you and God bless..
1:09 Oh yes, you definetely capitalizing on the view by building _that_ (the captions agree)
Respect Broother
1:09 lovely big WHAT?
beautiful!!!
Really amazing
This was peaceful!!
Beautiful, home and work life.
I just love this home. It’s gorgeous. And just perfect for a couple and fur babies. And a beautiful spot as well. Only four weeks in and it looks so homey like they have been there a long time. Great all in price. And the smoothie bar is so totally cool. Just wish them happiness. Enjoying their beautiful life together. Leslye
WOW! you  guys have done a great job of  Effective cost and construction, top shelf.  Congratulations.
Looks so cool, I am jealous of this lifestyle....
Really nice absolutely brilliant
What a lovely house. It would be fantastic to come back and see the outdoor area,  awning and gardens finished off. Thank you for opening your home to us all.
He was supposed to say big deck instead he said big dick hhhhh
How big is it?
Awesome. I want to do that in 10 yrs)
Wow, I live on the Gold Coast. This is incredibly inspiring.
My God, GORGEOUS home, The reuse of the old/dirty water grossed me out, but very economical use of water I guess.
Only screen rooms 4 me in Australia....way 2 many creepy-crawlies 3 leave foors and windows wide open😬😱
Do people really sit there looking at a view, eating a salad.
These couple is so sweet and happy
I'm surprised not to see a beautiful garden.
I LOVE IT!!!
This is amazing. I've watched quite a few of these tiny houses but this one seems the most comfy and plausible to live in. Kudos to this couple because this is just the dream. Especially getting the 5 days off a week part. It's just amazing once you let go of all those materialistic dreams. I wish I could do that but I am very much a city girl and I love to own stuff. I'll put this in a list of what I want to do in the future 🤗🤗
I think I have found my favorite tiny house video you all have done. Such a well thought out layout, one of the happiest couples to be interviewed I have seen on here. The fact that they work so hard together, and enjoy each others company. This is what an actual relationship goal looks like.
This is one of my favorite tiny houses!
What is there work ??
Where and how does the laundry get done?
These people don't live there. They just set it up to show off. I know, I live in that area. They are only there when there's cameras around.
Realy so beautiful tiny house and nice couple
I've just watched 2 of the Australian Tiny House videos and they are just beautiful and inspirational!!
I love their honesty that the build was tasking to their relationship, such a cool couple.
this house is so cute... i love it
Simple & comfortable
wow super bravo
With a bathroom like that, I would definitely put in a tub.
1:11  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
What happened? Bryce used to be kinda sexy, no he just looks bedraggled all the time. Fix the hair dude.
I hope the nxt 30 ...40....50....yrs are special .enjoy peace...
30 years what a happy couple. Wish we could all have that. Great style lots of room the Australian climate. And Kevin is pretty hot for a dad with adult children 👍👍👍. Just saying.
This is something I would highly invest on.

Spacious and tiny don't belong in the same sentence.
That big hill leading straight down to the house
What a stunning tiny house, it's definitely one of my favorite, it's so spacious and every space is beautiful
I like this. Not too tiny
Check out the thermal air conditioning used by Earth ships built in the desert. You have plenty of room to bury some underground pipes that could come up from under the home. You could use the solar power to run a few small fans to pull the cool air through the pipes. 57% underground air cooling for free and powerless.
Wow, I’m in love with this design and the couple are lovely too (you can tell they’re good people). The 3 metres wide makes a huge difference! They’d need an oversized permit to move it, I assume, but it’s worth it if you’re not going to be moving it much (or if at all). I can’t believe they did it for only $54,000 including the solar set up! Would love to know more build details!!!
where do i get the specs  ?
WOW $54,000!! that is amazing!!!
At 1:10 turn on English captions you're welcome
Amazing
They look like really cool people. I wish I could get shit faced drunk on their deck and make a total ass of myself.
what an inspiration!
Price?
讚👍
This is good for now and my compliments to the couple on a beautiful house. But when they are old in 2 decades and have walking problems, how they gonna get up those stairs to the bedroom ?
Not everyone looking into tiny houses are parents...
Am I the only one who’s impressed by the fact that they have no TV. I think that’s impressive that they can disconnect like that.
We are smiling now😂😂😂
When I was a second year architecture student in China I designed a nice house like this, I called it "Enomoto's Tree House" because the first floor is really small, but the second floor is bigger supported by wooden columns, it's capable to contain parents, kids, and elders to live. But my professors rejected it because "Thieves can easily get in the house". Different country, different rules I guess
This has got to be my most favorite tiny house build, both inside and out.  Beautiful! Though the price to build, at 50k plus, is quite a bit higher than most.
I love it. I love it. I love it. Even the part time job aspect.
Yknow, I really love the idea of composting toilets and I've visited some perfectly clean ones. Didn't smell one bit. But my most recent experience seems to have me a bit traumatized I guess lol... I was camping with my family down in an open-concept campground (no fees) and you had to walk quite a ways to the picnic area to get to the bathroom... And it was the most horrifying thing in the world. You walk in and there are flies EVERYWHERE. Literally coating the walls, sitting inside and outside the toilet itself, sitting on the toilet paper... You walk near the toilet and they go up in a frenzy. I don't really remember anything about a smell, but the sight itself was enough to deter me. Actually my mother was the first to go in and told us about it, and I honestly was unable to comprehend the number of flies until I saw it myself. I had thought to myself, "Oh, what's the problem with a few flies"... Hah. It was so horrible we ended up calling it "The Throne of Flies."  Anyway, what I'm trying to say is now whenever I see a compost toilet I flash back on the Throne of Flies. I'm sure my brain will stop doing that eventually, but until then... *shudders*... I can at least say I'll never be able to forget it.  Maybe if I ever go tiny I'll just be extra vigilant about keeping those toilets clean. Or just look for a different alternative.
Hold on a minute! Married for thirty years, three grown up children! How young do this couple look? Clearly all that healthy juicing suits them both. 👏👏 Awesome bathroom/dressing area. Love this couple. Good luck to them both. 👍😎👍
Absolutely lovely <3
Simplemente Adorable.
He looks like Conor McGregor  !
I am always so inspired with the tiny house video. Thanks for sharing always. Another inspiration.
The best tiny home by far...
All of what anyone could want and none of what you don't want.
Wow inspiring! Thanks for sharing.
Far and away the bathroom is the best part of the house!  Having a large luxurious bathroom can make the difference between a Tiny Home and a travel trailer lol. Combining it with a changing room is so smart.  Check out Ana White channel and website for some amazing and ingenious ideas that will blow your mind. Cheers mates and happy trails
Beautiful home for a tiny house.... I always have a problem with the safety of the stairs .. you need a cable deck rail's or Iron handrail for Safety .. "So Narrow".. Perfect 💯
I've been drawing up design ideas for over a year now, and this couple built a very similar designed tiny home to what I'm planning on building with the doors and huge deck.  I'll let you know when I get mine built so you can come and tour it.
Once you see the regular house in Hong Kong, the word "Tiny House" in this channel has to redefine.
Love love love your story. I envy your cute little house. Hopefully one day i have my own house.
“.... by building this lovely big dick of around the house.” oh deck you mean
I'm on the gold coast. Is there any chance I could find out where they got there trailer built?  Thankyou  Luke
Beautiful place!
fantastic home!! beautiful - wonderful lifestyle change!
I love it when tiny houses have doors/sides that open to the outside like this one.
Connor McGregor in his retirement 🤣😂
Wow this is one of my favourites!
How much did it cost?
Now this one..I like the space👍
I think that this tiny house is definitely at the top of the list of my favorites!  It is beautifully built and spacious...I just love it (and the dogs are adorable)!
Such a beautiful home
Very Very  Nice!   What are the exterior colors?
Wow, I was blown away by this tiny house, it's beautiful and I couldn't believe the cost. Every time you post a new video Bryce I feel the need to do the tiny house thing and shrug off the world but it's so scary :)
What a stunning space! Also was wondering were I recognised the faces from... The markets!! Congrats on the beautiful home guys
Best tiny house I've ever seen. Absolutely stunning and what a wonderful couple! Well done! :)
Fabulous. I love the large larder cupboard.
What a stunning home!
Hi, I'm from Russia. SUPERR HAUSE
Such a clean well done build.  They could probably start taking orders if they were up to it.  Love the fact that they are truly off grid.  A vegetable garden on the deck will be the perfect touch.
I want to have a Smoothie and Juice caravan and a tiny house in the country side now. Tired of my job. Tired of living in the city.
That's a " not so tiny " tiny house but a good one 👍
Magnifique ! J'ai enfin trouvé une maison.
Yes, Bryce is hot. but OH MY GAWD(in Janice's voice), the husband is so effin hot. I can't deal with it.
Awesome couple, great house!! Love bathroom   ❤️
what is basic material of this house ? can anybody help ?
Such a beautiful space.  Thank you for sharing.
This beautiful house bring them to a beautiful life! Really love this channel
Can't imagine living out in the boonies like that.  Seems like one ca only take so many walks in the woods, and then what?  To each his own, but I like the bustle of  city life.  Libraries, museums, theaters, reastaurants...people....
I love how these two are living their lives! From there house, to their work. So refreshing
Brilliant!
Love there way of thinking!! As an empty nester if my hubby thought the same way as me, we would be debt free!!! Love, love,love the space and doggies!!!
Big space, Decent bathroom! Cute dogs! lovely home and couple.
i'd love to build this model for my parents some day!
The Kiwi accent makes me a little uncomfortable every time Bruce talks about "a big DECK wrapping around the house".
M so obsessed with this channel...
Very good design of Tiny house $50K inclusive - minus cost of land :) I like the bathroom design clever & bifolds. How much was the steel frame worth? (termite free), great to see a comparison to 2 bed Steel frame kit home, shipping container home.
Very interesting house. Steel framing should be used more widely as it is lighter, but very strong and will stay square better than any wooden frame. I did not hear it mentioned, what is the height of the loft space?  Interesting design.
I love her laugh....💞
Youre NOT putting ANYTHING like this in southern california!  Part of the "tiny house" ruse
One of the nicest tiny homes I've seen.. love the spacious washroom and design..
So who else noticed they built with a steel frame? It's even riveted, instead of welded, so it will stand up better to being towed. Very nice work from some folks who put some thought into what they're doing. I'm not worried about the gigantic door span anymore. [grinning]
Very good. I love the drone shot with all the big houses in the area. This one looks so much more at home and so much more like a home. Great effort and an inspiring couple, thanks Bryce.
Lovely couple with the lovely house!
For a small house. It sure has a lot of space.
Bryce you are so cute. Is there a chance you would let your hair grow long again? 😍
The couple is sweet and lovely
Very envious.....
Beautiful (and surprisingly spacious) home.! And another great find Bryce.  Could you though add back the metric/inches and dollar conversions on screen?  You know we here in the US are metric-challenged.
I dont care if i have a small house, but i need a freedom of life. No stress. No busy environment.
Beautiful.
Bryce 💓
Love this!! 😃👍🏼
These people have figured out...life!
I would love to see a revisit of this house in a year or two to see what changes they have made, having only lived in it for 4 weeks so far.  Really nice for a self build, too.
Does a tiny house ever have a toilet downstairs and one in the loft? Especially for older people.
What type of Terriers were those.  Rad little doggies!
What a lucky man! His wife is dreamy 👌🏻😍
Rich is not just about how much money you have.  These folks are rich!
Beautiful!
Amazing house & couple...very inspirational. Coupled with outstanding presentation (as always!) Bryce!  What breed of dogs are they?
Beautiful Home & Beautiful People Thanks for Sharing.
Absolutely gorgeous!!! Love the spaciousness .. the colour scheme and the simplicity ... sweet doggies too :)))
This British accent...sometimes hard understand and the man looks so young than his partner
Very nice spaceous tiny home in Australia.  A+😍
this is truly my fave to date. Thank you so much for sharing!
You are so great at finding the special warmth from each home, and how the people are so creative in designing their home.  I love watching your videos even though I already live in a mobile home; but we may add features later that you have shown.  Your voice seems eager and excited over each home you view.
Awesome couple
I love watching tiny houses and planning to make it for myself in the Philippines
A wonderful home Bryce.  Mind me asking, what area is this on the GC?  (Tamborine Mt???)
We live tiny.... and we love it! I like the way she said you save money and you have a lot of time to spend with each other. Time is the most important thing in  life
Wowee what a tiny house! 😍 Love the video Bryce!
Hands down, best one yet.
Really impressive build, lots of floor space and great choice using the lightsteel frame.
fantastic !
Beautiful couple and beautiful home!!
This is one I could live in. I wouldn't want to go any smaller for a couple. Well done. The only thing I would change is the fireplace, too big and too close to the TV.
Well I know which parent was the one tried to be buddy buddy with their kids, literally.
Awesome couple, awesome build!  They seem like really cool people.  Thanks for sharing another great video with us Bryce!
VERY NICE!!!!!  Great living space!  Can't see anything to gripe about!  Work week--WOW!  ENJOY!!!!!!
Love the stairs!
I like the build of the TH and their overall plan. And that flipped working week is what I would like to be working towards to.
What a great place! I must also say you two are a wonderful couple.
You are both awesome :) and inspirational.. just doing what you love and owning what you need.. of grid has a bright future! Greetings from the Netherlands.
Beautiful home, such a nice couple! So happy for you that you managed to build time back into your lives - which is all that matters, really.
I love the idea of bathroom as the cabinet for clothes. Awesome
Space ~ Inside & Outside.  Lovely!!!
Great guys!.....keep up your great life style!🙌👌
Nice
Beautifully done Jan and Kev. For doing it yourselves, it truly looks like it was built professionally. I love every thing about it. That bathroom is quite marvelous, and one of the things that I backed up to look at again was at the end of the video when Ken was reading on the bed. I was struck by the wall behind him. So simple, yet so beautiful. You have given me some great ideas for the future! BRAVO!!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
can't get any better than that... and have a tiny business on their own too! I luv the spacious home you've got there!
$39,517.20 USD if you were curious and live in the USA like I do. :)
Very nice.I loved it
No kitchen hood,bedroom ceiling to low ,no landry appliances..wont do for me ..for the rest its awesome
He built a "dick" around the house.  ha ha ha
So, all that tiny house, living in a bus, container building etc. trends of the recent years for me is showing that people just cannot afford a normal property and house anymore. Nice for those who are living in happiness but for me it is more a sign that even middle class people have hard times to build their own hoses today thus looking for alternatives. Call me negative but thats my honest opinion.
I'd love to see a check in when they've lived there for a year! Please make that possible. 💗
Bloody awesome!!!!!! Fantastic job. Just curious on one aspect. Say there was a falling out with their friend, who owns the land. What would happen to the tiny house???? Thanks in advance.
How much?  Did I miss that?  Wonderful build they should sell the plans.
This show is my happy place. Even the themed music on the show makes me Instantly happy! LOL! 😊
straight into the top 1!!!!
Wow! I love the steel framing of the house 🏡👍🏾😎
Another beautiful couple living in a beautiful tiny home! Always such a pleasure to watch.
WOW!!! That "tiny home" is HUGE!!!! They can come to the USA and build one just like theirs for my husband and I. That home is very impressive! Thanks so much for sharing this with us.
I will build a house like this. Can you please send a floor plan?
That man looked a bit like mcgregor
Lovely home and so cute doggies.
Makes me think of Glenn Murcutt’s Lee House !
Small home ❤❤😍😍😍
Really nice and spacious and the setting is beautifull!! All you really need for a couple. Could though never be able do this in my home country(Switzerland). Just a very small plot of land would cost a half a million. No way of just setting this on a friend’s piece of property. Not more then 9 square meters and 2 meters high is allowed for a garden shed...and that has to be reported and drawn in at the township. Anything bigger you are confronted with building permits and all the hassle that goes along with it.
Now that’s ‚living the dream‘, as far as I‘m concerned. All the best to them (and all their future grandchildren, who will totally love it there!).
Nice house but what is it with most of these tiny house owners? They always end up parking on friends or families land. Show some responsibility people. A little less depency on others if your really trying to make a statement on self sufficiency.
Such a lovely video. What a great couple.
You guys are genius . A very nice home you did what i dream of doing. I wish you the best for the future.
I love this tiny house very well designed n spacious!👍
Nothing more vicious than "depraved toast" 8:47
I am in love with the love shared by these two <3
Terrific! FABULOUS!! INCREDIBLE!!! Words fail me... Very Exciting, indeed!
Holy your channel has blown up, Bryce. Congratulations man, it's well deserved.  I remember watching your canvas tent video for the first time at way under 100k subs; man does time fly by quickly... Great prospects for the future too knowing the increasing interest in sustainable living :)!
Love them and their tiny home. Congrats on 1M!
Awesome video
I LOVE THIS! Thank you for sharing!
Fantastic video! Love the spaciousness and how they are doing what they love with a flexible career!
Tiny house, still have to be rich. Sigh.
Build a tiny house on two acres and with 5000$. Game anyone?
Married 30 years... did they marry in primary school?!
im still looking for the "lovely big dick" they built
Beautiful tiny house
Truely living The Dream!
so, Bryce, your book at 13:34, went off to amazon to check it out. $170 bucks?!  and no kindle version? is it really for sale, cause it seems like it ships from Argentina.
Glass doors? ... no, that dark color is over heating the house mate
This is now one of my all time favorite tiny houses! I appreciate how they kept it real, by telling of their struggles during the build - they are so right when they say in most tiny house interviews the homeowner(s) are usually all smiles, and everything is rainbows and happiness. That's just not the reality for most. I truly appreciated that they brought that up. I do wonder about the clothing being in the bathroom, as far as damp or mold in the closet? How do they deal with that? I think this house is pretty perfect, with the only thing I'd probably change is put in some sort of washer and dryer instead of a closet in the bathroom.
I kept imagining a funnel web spider crawling across that deck and into their tiny home.
It’s obvious that you guys don’t know anything about radiant barrier. You can get it as a parent you can get it as a foil but it will stop 98% of the radiant heat coming in from the sun. I paint a house that I had in Sacramento that was 130° inside my home because the sun bear down on the front door. It was so hard you couldn’t even move when you were inside. Once I painted the front door with radiant barrier paint you have to press really hard on that door in order to feel any heat whatsoever prior to painting the door you couldn’t even touch it without burning your fingers and forget about using the old Fashion latch to open it it just couldn’t touch it. That house that had no insulation whatsoever not the ceiling not the walls but just with the pink radiant barrier paint and then I put the radiant barrier foil in the attic ceiling area it drop the temperature from 130° down to 85. The paint works wonders radiant barrier paint. I suggest and recommend this to anybody who has problems with too much sun coming into their homes without having to change the AC or your heating elements. I had no AC. And no heat for a very long time
What a great place and a great couple
wow this is perfect guys. I love your home, it is beyond spacious and beautiful!
Amazingly cozy love it. Sweet couple. Yep it's just the way to live life.❤
I live in the gold coast and instantly I recognised it was there before he the vid started
54 grand diy that's awesome
Such a cool business! No wonder these folks look so vibrant!
That bathroom 🤩
Love the home! What kind of dogs were those??
I just want to live simple like them one day. ❤
That is a beautiful big deck!
That woman and the aged Connor McGreggor have a great home!
All that for less than 60K, wow
Did he say they are using 15% or 50% of their battery backup for power?
Lovely home!
This is the best off the grid tiny house I've seen!! Love it!!
The guys a giant. She sucked him off
I love this, especially the bathroom!!! It's beautiful, and the tiny home on a trailer I bought was a smoothie biz. You just gave me new inspiration, and my dream is alive again!!!
Simply gorgeous!!, I would love to minimize down to small living and work only on the weekends!!  They are a charming couple so they deserve it
Great interview, interviewees. Thank you.   Can anyone recommend a tiny homes channel that focuses largely on the Pacific NW (US) or the West Coast?
Absolutely my favourite tiny home so far! Great job Kev and Jan.
Very spacious, classy decor...double sinks...the views!  It's a wowzer.
Awesome😍👍👍👍💓
How didn't he go with living on a  property..  Thought u could only live on someone's property if you are related... (Family member)
Just a beautiful home and a charming, relatable couple! I saved this one! Thanks Bryce!
cool folks, when they said they are married 30 yrs, i was in shock: these guys don't look a day over 40
What a lovely couple, and beautiful home. Definitely one of my new favourites! It was also so refreshing to hear that the build was tough work, relationship wise, too. This aspect is so often glossed over, so it was very refreshing that they kept it real. 🤓
Well done 👏🏾
They look really happy and healthy. Maybe I'll start juicing...
How do I Get away from these idiots?. That guy is so Naively wet, it makes want to vomit. I thumbs down always, and Im not going to block or report, since they have done nothing  wrong per se (other than being annoying, irritating and having a smug entitled demeanor that makes me want to super glue his dumb face to a toilet bowl).
Oh dear I so understand how hard building is on a relationship. It’s such a relief when you can pull the relationship back together.
Ahh...sweet. So happy for them.
inspiring house.... another nudge towards taking this life change on... 🙏🏼✨
its awesome and they have something  from athers homes.its have style and shoul for some different for life.Souper guys souper home...
This is probably one of my favorite
It looks so comfortable, I am loving this house
Oh my Gott 🥰dreamhouse❤️
This Home is awesome.
Amazing g
This is by far the nicest and most practical tiny house I’ve ever seen. Very beautiful, stunning, actually, and not one area feels cramped. Nice job, and congrats to you both!
very cool house. That is a big portion for that small dog, that's why they are fat. Reduce the portion!!!
Such an inspiring couple :)
LOVE this one!!!!!
oh my gosh.. seriously the coolest tiny home I've seen thus far that I would love to live in ! So spacious and that bathroom and closet combo is such a genius idea..high ceilings and the sliding doors really open up the outdoors that is exactly what I want ! Tons of windows to let in the sun <3 love how the bathroom//closet is down-- bed-loft is upstairs. the stairs are also close to the bathroom//closet area. Beautiful kitchen! Lovely home :)
likin it bathroom ,,,
Great Home!!! Nice job Kev and Jan!
Such a happy couple! I'm truly enthusiastic for them.
GORGEOUS!!!!!!
Brilliant keeping the clothes all in the bathroom downstairs.
Beautiful couple! We're empty nesters too...in a small small house! Love this
Love these guys!  I got sooo many ideas!!!
Just gorgeous!!
Aaah all I need is one of your videos to make my day. Much Love!!
Probably the best tiny house that I've ever seen. Wow, how lucky!
This. Is so awesome!!! Iove the smoothie buiseness.
This is the best tiny house I’ve seen, love it.
Love this home.
This is my favorite project of this channel! I've seen a lot that I really really like, but this is actually my dream home. Love it! Thanks for sharing guys.
Outstanding home and they seem like a lovely couple.   Slightly jealous of their achievements, but wish them all the best.
Nice
Beautiful home and what an inspiration.
Where can I get your book? Am now here in Morocco.
Lovely couple, lovely home! That truly is a million dollar view. If this works for them, awesome. Would like to see a revisit in 6 months, after they have adjusted. Maybe that could be a series for you -- revisiting people who have been in their homes 6+ months to see what adjustments, if any, they have had to make. Well done!
50K for all of that??? WOW...stunning and such a down to earth couple...
😜 How do you fit a dual fuel cooker and not realised it’s half electric.. what did you think the 30 amp cables were for?
awesome design! Enter to my top 5, great work
Beautiful home
The best Tiny house yet
This is a stunning tiny house . . . one of the best . . . but  as one person observed below where is the laundry or facilities to wash clothes? I was wondering if it is in that massive bathroom some where.
Pretty sure I heard them say there were in a Drought...but it sure looks like the Deck is wet. Beautiful home.
Interesting, any insight on how they got it towed into position? From what I've read the legal towing width limit is 2.5m (for Australia) so that'd be an oversized load which they would've had to get someone else to tow for them.
This tiny home inspire myself! And this family wich so amazing and happy!
Can somebody explained the stove issue?
Yay Gold Coast local🌈
Amazing!! Lovely house!!! Lots of love from Brasil!
Beautiful house... I wanna build like this one.
Surprised to see this on the Gold Coast and with it things are looking up ;) It was several years ago, I first saw an established lived in Yurt and sanctioned council shipping container on the Sunshine Coast, where my initial spark for tiny house living began. :) Me at the moment, livin in inner city Melbourne, Vic.  Keeping the dream alive. <3
How tall are you bryce?
nos encanto el cuato de baño, y el espacio y el parque...
Love 💕 this
Love how they seem to do everything with a glass of red in their hands!
Lovely couple lovely house
Love this home! Love the dogs! The sliding, folding front doors are such a beautiful feature. Awesome bath. Home is so spacious! Great interview! Thanks!
🤗 I 😍 It Watching Here In MINMI AU Oi Oi Oi
ONE MILLION subscribers! Well deserved.... congrats from Pittsburgh Pennsylvania. USA 🎉🍾🎈🎊   One of my favorite you tube channels. ✌️❤️😀.
Such an inspiration to see lovely people like you! Great content! Keep inspiring! Thanks for sharing. 👍
This is my favourite episode so far, a lovely house that's been so well thought out and constructed and two really nice people :-)
Awesome setup Australia has the climate for tiny house living.
Beautiful tiny. I would as this un m'y garden 😍😍😍😍😍😍
.  💛 🧡 💜 ❤ 💙 💚 Absolutely Beautiful Tiny Home even though it seems bigger than a Tiny Home.  So Spacious.
What does the weight and how big of a "truck" do you need to tow it?
Why install such dinky guard rails? Is it to insure that if you fall, you get tripped to fall on your head, instead of your ass?  Think a little!  This is why we need building codes. This "Safety feature" will not pass any building code in any country.  Excluding that, its perfect. Even the dogs are super cute.
Well done Kev and Jan!! Love it:-)
0:10 Do you normally visit more than one couple at a time, Bryce? The emphasis of your sentence is rather odd...
outstanding...m
Tiny? Semi-small maybe! That bathroom is life! They look good for a couple who has been married 30 LONG years and raised THREE children. Marriage is not easy. Then, I saw what they did for a living! Bravo! They are about life and healthy eating. No wonder they look good. He, in the face, looks especially young and relaxed. That deck! Wow. And, let's not talk about the those two cute little pups. Adorable. 😍
❤️🍀
partners? don't people get married in Queensland?
😘😘😘😘
I love it and all of the space of openness...They are super nice people and did a really Awesome job on building there Tiny home..Thank you Bryce for another Awesome video...
Amazing video Bryce. This couple is so inspiring
My future life! Super cool spot to be....good job!
Lovely couple.
Yeah if I had 30k
Great video. What a beautiful home and such a lovely couple.
This makes me very happy
What a beautiful house! They seem like a cool couple. Nice video!!
Living off grid doesnt mean you let your guard down. Make sure you have a weapon, just saying. Also, where would they go if there is a medical emergency? for themselves and the dogs. This has to be taken accounted for, a medical facility should be close by.
💙💚💙💚💚
Hey guys, wonderful set-p, we like youreselves have a piece of land, ours however with a sea view, but, none the less, can you recomend and plans, floor plans, architechtecs or even people who guided tou in terms of plan and regulation? Thanks Alex and Amanda
What kind of dogs are the two cuties you have? Are they grown or quite young.  Thanks, Bob
Fantastic home...an amazing big tiny house - what a bathroom - so much room! Thank you Bryce for showing us Aussies what is happening with tiny houses in our country.
Beautiful house, lovely couple!  Some people get themselves in a million debt for a house.  Some other build their gorgeous home for 50k, strengthen their relationship while doing so then enjoy time freedom sometimes also enjoy being location independent. I am amazed and forever inspired by tiny house people! Thank you Bryce & Rasa for all these awesome vids :)
Bryce another job well done.....Very nice....the couple too...they are sexy as HELL...(fit & flexible) great job COUPLE....y’all should start a YouTube channel....I’d certainly tune in....love from Houston TEXAS
Wow the big bathroom! so great!
Dear Bryce, just because all the children move out does not mean that they no longer have a say in what their parents do, or do not get considered. Let us not be the "me" generation but the one that continues to care for our children, our grandchildren and whoever else needs caring for. Of course, if we can, moving into a tiny house might be what is good for us and for others too....but not because it is right for "me" or for "us". Let us live far less entitlement - let us live because we love.
Beautiful home!  Lovely couple!
The bathroom is really smart. I don't see a laundry, but if it's in there too then I'd say it's perfect.
1:24  “Always gonna be a dick”
one of the nicest tiny builds I've seen
14mx3m!?! Lol it’s beautiful and I’m happy for them, but just call it a house.
I've always like the sliding windows/doors.
Really really nice tiny house. So peaceful and calming. For me, it is not so tiny. Pretty spacious. Love it.
See what , two amazing minds can create '' in a tiny space' this is amazing together'' spacious and warm n cozy feel love the deck as well' good job guys' enjoy your efforts you've made a beautiful off grid home.
A very nice home to be owner-built! They should be proud of their craftsmanship. Great video, Bryce!✌🏻
01:11 Lovely Big Dick XD
Lovely home! And what a fun couple! And they show great taste in reading material 😉
One of my favs! Awesome that they run a healthy business and only work weekends!
This is a real nice bathroom that they have there. Love the bathroom concept. Living room and kitchen blends in very well with open space, especially the door to bring in fresh air in. Love it.
their place is really nice
the best bathroom in a tiny house i've ever seen
Great tiny house, great sofa!
We miss you in the USA but I am sure you are glad to be home.  This house is so lovely, I could see myself and my family enjoying this setup easily!  thank you,,, Sass
Great show and beautiful home
It's beautiful tiny house
Bryce, the lives you've changed. Well done.
Perfection in a home. Easy to get up to the spacious loft, spa like bathroom, and oh that sofa with the huge widow door... plenty of room to cook a meal.
This was built on site... Is it possible to get a 10 meter unit up that road and moved off the site?
One of the best episode i have seen. such an inspiration to see what this couple had done. cheers to blissful marriage!! 30 years, no less!!
Easily a favourite tiny home. Lovely couple. Always appreciate Bryce’s interviews.
Hola! Hermosa casa. Practica, útil,  hogareña y Funcional. Me encanto! Un abrazo.
oh gosh ,the 2 dogs
This is one of the best tiny houses i've seen and the view is just beyond beautiful 😍😍😍
Guys, that looks like a beautiful setup that you have made for yourselves. I like the fact that it is a “big” tiny house and has a large bathroom, that is really cool. Also being away from mortgage and rent and utilities bills is just amazing. Well done!!
Love this house, and their vibe and lifestyle, and dogs of course. Always a pleasure watching your videos Bryce!
Great video! And by far, my FAVORITE Tiny House design yet! My favorite things, the bathroom, the bookcase, and the stairs. Incredible home!
Best tiny house I haved seen
Isn't it ;d
Love the house!!!!
OMG this one is a diamond!!
What a lovely tiny house! Thank you for sharing!
Just beautiful!  And what an amazing bathroom, very well thought out, what with dressing there.
Nice way to water the plants... with soapy water.
i think even Aussies and Kiwis get stumped by what can come out of Brits mouths . lol SWEET Crib ! hard to believe they've been married 30 years
These people look beautiful!
Best ever!!!
Beautiful life for a beautiful couple 😎
Wow! What an incredible tiny house. 🏡😊
The one who is moderator reminds me Josh Groban. they are so good looking.  I like this show by the way. Thank you from Thailand. It's so hard for Thai people do this way, Even though they have a passion for it. Except you're a rich guy or millionaire.
This is an amazing build!  They did such a fantastic job! And so have you, once again Bryce. 😁. Thank you.
Clearly people from Australia have more creativity, imagination and the just the ability to build cool shit... At least compared to me.
This is one of the best houses so far. I love the larger bathroom and kitchen and the wall of doors make it seem so much larger.
Beautiful house and couple.😍
Beautiful home , lovely couple & another great video !
conor mcgregor's brother, nicely done.
May I ask how much it cost?
What a spacious tiny house. The best part about this is it looks so open. Also this couple is so likeable.
great house. nice people
And you guys look Good! Love the home.
A 3 metre wide tiny-house, as opposed to a 2.5 metre wide tiny-house, is a much more user-friendly doable option for many people considering whether they could actually downsize to a tiny house.
That’s a BIG Deck
A lot of the time in the vegan/eco community I see lifestyles that are one way or another impossible for a disabled person. For example the ladders and narrow spaces in a lot of tiny houses would be impossible or very difficult to navigate with a physical disability. This build is interesting because with the amount of floor area and ceiling height they have, it might be possible to build a space that's wheelchair accessible. If the building was designed with more passive cooling or was in a cooler location and didn't need to be air conditioned, the extra electricity they are planing to use for air con could be used for a motorised system to get someone safely up and down from the loft.
That bathroom is the biggest I've seen yet in a tiny house. Beautifully done. Love all the finishes too. They're truly living their golden years!
True environmentalists would live in the city and not spoil that untouched land.
That's a nice deck
lovely couple nice home too!
What a cute couple.. They have the perfect life there.
I love the bathroom space and using rainwater catchment for more sustainable water. Living in a climate that gets very cold in winter, I have not seen many tiny houses parked in the snow! Would love to see something like that Bryce if you know anyone!
Can you make a video that covers tiny house plumbing? Like how do you route the pipes and where do p traps and s traps go, vent pipes ext. That would be very helpful
The videos, of course, cost money to do, so of course there have to be ads. Just be patient, till you get to the "skip ad" part.
Omg. That bathroom though!!! :)
My favorite so far!  Love it!
Beautiful home, I wonder though about laundry? By hand?
This couple & their home are gorgeous!
Goes on my visionboard straight away!!! Thanks for this beautiful inspiration.  Jeez! LOVE tiny houses (look at this fella! 🤩), LOVE their aussie accent (I’m German, but lived down under some time) and love Australia anyway. This makes me so happy! This is it.   Thanks so much for sharing!
I can't believe they've been married 30 years they look so young!
A beautiful "big Tiny House" the best I've seen...the kitchen is bigger than mine and that bathroom OMG stunning...congratulations to the lovely couple who are living their dream 🙂 I have to say I'm a wee bit jealous...thanks for showing us this Bryce 🙂
This is one of the most BEAUTIFUL  tiny homes I've ever seen. Amazing. LOVE the extra height in the bedroom. Simply Magnificent!
Great build and lovely couple. I love their pups too.  ❤️
All I noticed is this guys wicked mullet.
Thank you Bryce.  Beautiful home and wonderful couple.  Have a good weekend.
Simply wonderful!  This "not so tiny" house is gorgeous!  A lifestyle that truly appeals to me all the way around.
Wow what a great home, I would love to have this. You are by far the best vlogger about this topic Bryce! Greetings from Sweden!
A lot of planning went into this, before the first hammer swing! Love the kitchen, and bathroom!
I love these two! Brilliant home. Xo Canada
This is the way to live" "In luxury" and Happy" being a Brit" I would worry about little furry things coming through those beautifull doors"""great build and video"
Hi Bryce another great video my husband and I really really love this tiny home the couple did an excellent job absolutely beautiful
This couple has created a great new lifestyle for themselves and built an extremely attractive (and delightfully uncluttered) tiny home. Bryce, you are always a charming interviewer. Thank you for these wonderful and immensely enjoyable videos!
LOVE,LOVE,LOVE THOSE DOORS !
What a lovely couple and a beautiful tiny home! Love the sofa and the bathroom!
Is there a lot of the poisonous Brown snake around there ???
Those kitchen cabinets are gorgeous!
The view is breathtaking so fresh. So cool ❤️❤️
Idk what you did to your hair...something ain't right with that outro xD
Shit, a bathroom changing room actually makes ALOt of sense.
Where are my fellow Queenslanders?
Wow, what a lovely home!  Did they have any means to do laundry?
Each week after watching your vid I end up saying "today's tiny home is the best ever and it's at the top of my list" but you're always back with YET a mind blowing home that just ruins my last list!!! Keep it up bro you're doing such an amazing job showing us all those pieces of art all over the world!
Absolutely gorgeous!!!! And what an amazing couple 😍😍😍 And that’s an incredible price!!
3 meter width is really the way to do it. That extra .61 meters from a "standard" 2.39 meters width is huge(!) difference in terms of spacious feeling and comfort.
A real sofa! ☑️
Such a beautiful house! And I totally agree on their take on the building process. It does have lots of challenges - it's frustrating and rewarding, exhausting and inspiring at the same time. Lovely episode.
Wow! Absolutely amazing house & the upstairs head room is wonderful! & THE BATH ROOM!!!! ♥♡♥♡
It's just gorgeous!!!!
I love this channel so much. The host is seriously SO likable and you can tell that he is being sincere when he gives them compliments and gets excited about the different features in the houses. Im so happy for him that his channel is growing and successful
🌷🌸🌹🌻🌼
Bathroom is stunning😍 also I loved the dogs😘😘😘😘
Great episode as always Bryce ✌
Awesome build! 👍 Cools that they live in a tiny house and work in a tiny space.
Congratulations Jan & Kev it's a great Tiny House. Enjoy the time :D
Man, the host is an awesome person.  Always so positive and eager to hear what others have to say. He knows how to talk to people, as well. Great channel.
Ok ! Fave tiny home yet! I can seriously see myself living in here! No claustrophobia here! Love love love it!! $55000! Ugh! I paid $240k for my 800 sqft condo and this is way more open! Love this couple too!!
Beautiful😍
Who manufactures those glass opening doors?
This is so spacious. I love the happy vibe of the couple. I could stay on that couch and stare at the woods forever 🙂
54.000 dollars for this..... is simply madness.  In Italy you can buy a small apartment in south regions for this money. Italy is today in 10 most expensive country list, for houses price.
Stunning!!
This couple is so cute!!!! Congrats to the couple on fulfilling a dream & enjoying life!!!
That looks wonderful! The view from the living area is breath taking! Look forward to many more!
Bellissima!!!!😀😀👏👏
Fabulous home, fabulous couple. Cheers.
Love this couple.....
Super chill video. Really relaxing. Fills me with hope that I can do this one day and it'll be dandy.
One word "Nice"!
Pretty good home, I like it a lot. But what legal limit? What the f... is it, what country you live in? Government dictates you measurements of your home? Ridiculous.
Beautiful!
I know I should comment on the house but these two are just so cute together and has a cool business too. Can I be their friend?! :D
Wow!!! They are so healthy and look young. Lovely home!!!!
Congratulations Bryce on reaching the BIG 1M subscribers  ... thank you for all your hard work and wonderful posts. Absolutely love the spacious off-grid, plenty of room for empty nesters and no wasted space.
Truly a perfect home!
Bryce's interviewing skills have always been top notch, but there's something about this episode that is just incredible and mesmerizing to watch. The couple is lovely, and the dialogue Bryce establishes leads to some great conversations! Loving the videos!!
Love you Bryce.Do you need an assistant?
Your closing statements are excellent, they definitely keep the audience interested straight through till the end. Outstanding work.
Beautiful Home 😍
"empty-nesters" 😅 ... never heard that before. 👌🏻 These guys are emitting a quite chill, californian vibe - love it!
Over $50000 for this luxurious place of living that is amazing. Well done. Love and peace.🦋
This should speak VOLUMES to people across the world. Minimalist living + planning = less stress / more time / fulfillment
A wonderful story. Life is for living, not acquiring, and this couple are showing how it can be done in comfort and with style. Well done Kev and Jan. Now what’s that myth about whinging Poms?
Great little house.
One of my favorites to date The only things I would do differently is the style of wood stove and lithium bat's for the solar instead of those lead acids.  Cheers, Patrick
They look soooo young. It's amazing.
Great design...!  Looks spacious!
just cant imagine why anyone would give this a thumbs down - wtf !
This tiny house is beautiful but what makes it more entertaining for us viewers is the way Bryce brings out the best of its owners through his amazing interview skills. Great job!
+ as the owners read Lee Child´s books
Very lovely house 💕
Good on you! It is magnificent!
Functional,  aesthetically attractive,  off grid water, solar and in 8 acres of rugged land. Aaahhhh, bona vida!
Love it !   Paul & Susan North Georgia
It's a beautiful and perfect home ❤
Thanks, again, for a great video!
So awesome, love it.
Tiny house is for tiny people , not for 6'3" Bryce !
Stunning!
This is a really nice tiny house. Super functional.
I miss u guys a lot. Hit the like button if u missed them as well #livingbiginatinyhouse
Wow. This is truly beautiful living. I am completely envious. They are living the dream...
I think this is the house of my dreams!
OMG ... now that is a set-up. Not as deep into an  alternative perma-culture philosophy but look how the TH movement has morphed into becoming a 'normalised' viable option for a more middle -class trad family lifestyle. Off grid is almost becoming mainstream - no longer the preserve of vegan-anarcho nomads!  Your channel has been a prime mover for inspiring people to try a more sustainable lifestyle at whatever level they are comfortable with. It is so heart warming to know that people are getting turned on to an  off grid, greener living option - reducing their carbon footprint. Each home you feature is always a wonderful, totally unique expression of the move to a more eco-friendly and liberating way to live and a fantastic expression of their owners values. I was a bit sceptical of your  energiser-bunny, direct-to-cam  "Kevin McCloudesque" hosting approach initially. I first saw one of your vids when you toured Brett the bone carvers' whare about 4 years ago and I was blown away by his kiwi ingenuity as the use of space was really considered and smart. Slowly but surely you have won me over as I have entered the rabbit hole of your unique (and very influential) You Tube channel. A lot of your interviewees mention that your vids have been directly responsible for inspiring their builds and I can now understand why. Your content is heads and shoulders above the others for generating awe and enthusiasm for each Tiny House you visit and the fact you travel to so many countries to show people these wee beauties is so invaluable.  Insularity and homogeneity is soul-death!  I used to live  on the Gold Coast in the hinterland so this build resonated for me. You make  me proud to be a kiwi. Kia kaha.
This tiny house is more my style. I love it. Awesome house and nice couple. :)
I am 500th. like.
Bryce this is the best Tiny home channel there is hands down.    Can't wait every week for your videos.   Thank you to you and the folks you work with for the great shows.
Drone work is looking good.
This house is so beautiful 😍.my favorite part of the house is the couch and fireplace, and that glass door...and the price is amazing
After finally getting to stay at a tiny house in Portland for week gotta say its totally for me! Awesome video.
It's so refreshing to listen to Bryce... Who agrees with me? Anyone?
Love the house! And this couple Is adorable!!!
Love your place, great job with the design!!
Wonderful and inspiring.
Lovely video...lovely couple...as always lovely to see Bryce:) I think we should stop calling the homes 'tiny' from now on and start pointing out the unnecessary huge homes that are built only to collect mortgage and to keep people locked inside office all their life.. 'tiny home' should be called 'ideal home' that fits the family needs:)   hope the county officials will let us build what we need instead of following codes to extract money...it becomes difficult, even as land owners ,to live the life we like
Beautiful! It certainly looks like the house I'd love to live in the future. I love your videos as well guys, beautiful footage and Bryce interviews are always on point
Loved this.  Delightful couple. Enjoyed their banter and what they shared.  Nice tiny house.
I'll check out your Patreon. Again thanks for not going on and on about. All success to you both. Namaste.
Wow Bryce! The place looks enormous inside. The overall design is one of the best that I have ever seen when it comes to space use. I love their plan! Can hardly wait on that campulance finish!!
Wow! I love this, what a great design! #emptynestgoals
1 mil subs, great work mate, been here since around 30k, great to see the channel grow to new heights.
What about bears 🐻 and what not? Or I’m guessing since it’s hot their maybe they don’t have bears but theirs always other animals but I don’t know about all that glass in the front 😅
That is actually a very nice bigger tiny house and the setting is just breathtaking
Fabulous lifestyle
Amazing home!! The owners are super nice and friendly.
Beautiful!
outstanding couple and a great home.   Nice job folks.   Would love to have one of those juices right now.
absolutely fabulous! living the dream.. nice!
Lovely home and lovely people.  It's so cool that they have a place to park and live that is beautiful. This is one of my favorite homes.
That bathroom is amazing!
Ur videos inspires me a lot to build my own tiny house ....one day may be.... U always comes up with a nice intro.... U r full of energy and so are your videos..... One of your fan from Pakistan 😊
Beautiful home!!
DEFINITION OF A DIY POWER COUPLE!!!!!! GREAT JOB OF MAKING IT SO COZY YET SO SPACIOUS. #ANOTHER GREAT VID.
I binge watch you before I go off to bed and it puts me in such a calm mood. Thank you !!!!!
I WANTS TO LIVE LIKE THIS
Beautiful People! Beautiful Place! Thank you for sharing🌻 share love🌼
Im so envy right now, many other channel but Bryce's channel always be the most interested one for me
What a great life! I'm so happy for them
How are there 2 thumbs down??? This is beyond amazing and beautiful!! The people are lovely and I'm just bummed I dont live in Australia so I could enjoy their healthy smoothies and bowls!!  Cool couple and rad tiny home!
C’est magnifique ! Good job
Bryce I just wanted to say thank you for your integrity and not getting greedy with this channel. It is one of my favourite channels. I'm having a real dilemma at the moment, because some of my favourite youtubers, are putting more and more ads on their videos, more and more sponsored vids, and more and more veiled subliminal (ish) messages to buy this or that, that I'm wearing, eating, driving. It makes me really sad, as I feel really off in my stomach watching them now, and feel, I have to make a decision wether I stop watching some of my favourites. It makes me feel a bit sick when I watch them become more and more greedy, and more and more "pretending" that they just happen to be mentioning something, or have it displayed next to them on the table. Yet they pretend their viewers are so important as they get richer, and richer and richer. Thank god, you haven't done that. Please don't, I really value your honest integrity. I'd be really upset if that happened as I love this channel. I'm so glad that you reached a million subscribers. Good for you both. Sorry rant over.. I'm just feeling quite let down by the whole YouTube thing at the mo. 😁
So this house is *really literally really basically literally*
They look so young.. Full of life...
Such a lovely home and that surrounding is surreal.. Woww... Beautiful video... BRYCE.. WHY don't you come to India to explore tiny houses here?
I’ve been waiting all day for this!
واااو جدا جميل😍😍😙
1m+ subcrb... congratulations 👋
Bryce is such a good interviewer, he really puts people at ease and it makes such interesting watching
i like the design of it. i prefer to be on a grid then off grid.  best of luck to this amazing channel. im inspired to build one on a 5th wheel trailer in florida. i get so many great ideas from this channel. im so glad i found this amazing channel.
We're back with another series of Australian tiny house tours! This is such a great home and we really love the story of this build. Thanks for watching! For those who would like to support the channel and help us produce more content, we do have a Patreon page! https://www.patreon.com/livingbig - Thanks, and we'll see you next week!
I was wondering where the dining table was, glad to see it at the end haha. Another great home, and truly an enviable lifestyle! Very inspiring people.
