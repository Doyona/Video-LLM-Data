Day 2
Looks good
I decide to develop a new habit for my summer holiday,let’s see how many days can i follow it Day1:✅ Day2:✅ Day3:✅ Day4:✅  Day5:✅
Goddamn it looks so easy untill you do it.
I’m late but I’m starting this
should we be resting for a minute between each exercise?
That jackknife form is incredible, when I do it I look like I’m drowning
Neat
I tried this for the first time & geez it’s tough but I’m getting it done. Thank you man.
How muuch time inn one day
I am 230lbs and 1month postpartum. I am putting this comment here to help keep myself accountable. Please dont be mean. I am going to try my best.
.. anyone revisiting this video? .. i sure am.. lol i let go and now regretting it.. i still value this video because it was a huge help when i first saw it so many years ago!
day 2 rn - 20 left😂
How much rest rime between different exercises? 10 seconds as well?
Im starting the challenge today, lets fking go🔥
These workouts of @athleanX work best for me overall, but one thing I don't like is how many people there are coaching weight loss and muscle gain training, making it confusing to those who actually want to achieve a goal.
🇮🇱💪GOD BLESS ISRAEL🇮🇱🇮🇱
I'm doing something right I lost 10pounds watching these abb workouts
You go all in, until your holding your stomach from the pain.
I lost weight using this exercise plans 6 years ago now back here to repeat that with more muscle
IF YOU WANT EIGHT PACK ABS OR SIX DO WOMEN'S RUSSIAN ELITE GYMNASTICS EXERCISES.
I'm going to start this today. I've worked out on and off for years but have never been able to get a flat stomach let alone abs so I'll be back in 22 days to show you the results!
i was feeling so cocky until i could only do 1 set of most of these
Be careful doing the bottom up rotations.  I ended up with a gluteal strain from these. Not fun
Puma pants and nike shoes is nasty work
You worked that guy in the background a little too hard. 🤣
I’m 13 years old a white child who is 5,9 120 and I’m doing this because I’m hungry to get shredded and become a beast
Jeff knows his shit.
what if I cannot make even a single rep in the 3rd one？😢
All I see is abs
Today is my day #2.....I will write when I finish the 22nd  days challenge.😊
Thx for tips, im gona add these to my routines to develope even better ABS!!!
Time to get ripped AGAIN.  I’m ready.  6’/185
What 22 days no rest, not even time to sleep 😴 😂Wow that is hardcore. 😜
🥵🥵🥵
Amazing video
Yo this video was in a playlist that was in an account linked with treatsforbeasts 🤯
Do you rest more than 10 seconds between each exercise after one is extinct?
1
Done this a few times before. Apparently my core is weak again as an old injury is back and chiro said core needs to be strengthened.
When I first saw this I thought "no problem. That's easy"...I can do one set of the first exercise. I'll comment on here after 22 days.
.
body sixy
No equipment exercises are crucial for beginners. Great stuff. Here I go……😮
Day 1 done
Day three and idk if it’s just my eyes playing with me but my lower belly looks significantly flatter.
I got my abs , but my lower abs ain’t showing as much as the others . I’m taking care of what I’m putting in my mouth , but no results 😢
The best revenge is showing them what you are capable of.
Starting this today at 4/27 I’ll see y’all after the 22days
Hi, at the bottom up rotation, I can't turn my body like this while my arms at plank position, I must to releas one hand of that position while turning, it's still ok?
HIS BODY IS INSANE
Hi
Im sure he just likes putting moves together to SHOW OFF  this is impossible!!
So just do this one round a day?
This is amazing man
Great video.   Always trying to tone abs
You fucking Sucks balls, gets your ad off of my yountube you fucking tool
14 year old (boy), and got visible abs because of this video, added some extra exercises to it tho, thx for the video. So far only one at school with a muscular build so adding abs to that is nice
I got the upper abs and  half of the obelisk  I need some help on the middle and lower I have half of the middle have you guys got some advice for me
I love this workout so far I have did this workout for 22 days 4 times aready
These exercises are incredibly hard :( . How many reps are you able to do? I barely get to 1, except for the last one...
Thanks for the exercises
I broke my R fibula / ankle in Nov. 2022. My leg is wobbly to begin w/ because of MS - though I'm 65 YO female, working out, athletic x 45+ years. My goal is to strengthen my core / abs so that I can stablize the weak leg a tad. I'm so blessed, I use a cane, now cuz of the fracture. It occurred to me that I fell because I was not stable as I was just walking down the sidewalk on a beautiful day - my R leg gave way and slipped into the landscape section and I twisted - boom. I knew I fractured it - swelled up like a balloon. Anyway, no surgery per the orthopod - praise God!  Today, I'm going back to the gym to ease my way back into strengthening my core and my mobility, in general. Thank you, Coach Cavaliere. In 2020 I subscribed to the 90 Day level one workout - it was the men's but I adapted it. It was great. My 55+ neighbors thought I was a phenom for working out in the garage - the gym was closed. I was feeling and looking so fine - to this day, even w/ the leg issue. Jesse,  you rock, too!
Game time tomorrow I start this program for 8 months
My girl gon live this
Female here and actually saw a change in how my stomach looked by day 3-4. Haven’t even been doing all the exercises just two or three but I also do leg lifts and sit ups.
So here body weight 81KG, height 165cm, active tennis player and gym 🏋️‍♂️.  No a very good diet but I will Improve.  Today 10 January 2023 day 1  Will try to keep you posted evert 22 days, the goal is 6 months. See you then
Hey guys, want to ask you, when is the best time to do these exercises? Like I am going to the gym lifting weights and I am also a tennis player. So I work out 5 days a week. However my weight is not near the ideal and body fat as well to develop abs so I can say I am a beginner regarding abs. So when should I do it after my workout? At night? Morning? What do you think, thanks!!
Thank you very much
Got
Toàn nói phét !
how long do we wait in between excersises
Anyone now of an extinction style time? If not what do you use otherwise?
I'm starting tommorow. I will update.
99% of the time ab workouts aren’t gonna be effective. It depends on how lean you are, so being fat and trying this  (no matter how long) wont really make enough progress
I'm starting this workout, and will surely have abs by the end of this year (yes, the new year is 22 days away).  10/12: ✔ Very very difficult, especially the jackknives, but somehow managed to complete it. Can't say about the form, but good start !! 11/12: ✔ Started strong, could do 2 sets of "Heels to the Heavens", but couldn't do one of "Alternating Thread the Needle" and "X Men Crunch". However, it was intense, and I think it's going well. 12/12: ✔ So far happy with the progress, easily did one set of each (except, obviously Alternating Thread the Needle" and "X Men Crunch"). But the form was great so did well. 13/12: ✔️ The ab region is sore when stretched, though going well. X Men Crunch and Jackknives are still a challenge, as is Alternating Thread the Needle. But improving form, hopefully, be able to do one set of these in the next few days. 14/12: ✔ Abs absolutely sore. Even using ab strength to wake up is difficult. I guess that's a good sign. Same issues, Alternating Thread the Needle and X Men Crunch. 15/12: ✔ Come to the point where I don't like not feeling sore. In the beginning, I used to lower my feet to quite an extent to feel sore during Heels to the Heavens but doesn't happen now. Don't know what to infer from this, but Day 6 was done successfully. 16/12 : 17/12 : 18/12 : 19/12 : 20/12 : 21/12 : 22/12 : 23/12 : 24/12 : 25/12 : 26/12 :  27/12 : 28/12 : 29/12 : 30/12 : 31/12/2022 :
Fatal abs   open /close 6 inch killer 60 Flutter kick 60 (count same side wide kicks double pulse each leg) Oblique plank hip raises 60 (each side ) hip dip touch planks60(count same side) cannon ball sit ups 180total (60 single each leg / 60 double leg) and  Hollow rocks 60 Oblique toe touch 60 (count same side) Sprinter sit ups 60 (count same side ) Leg raises 60
Jeez this is brutal at first. I’m  gonna get through this . Didn’t make it through any exercise lol that’s my 1st goal day 1 complete . But surely you can’t do this everyday my stomach is in pain after day 1
22 days legs
ouch
Day 1
i love you...thank you so much :)
How often are you doing these Ab workout ? everyday ,every other day ?
Yup
Guna get this one out 💪🏼
Doing this gives me headaches lol
Can you please do a video about how to develop the ab crack (middle line)? Thank you!
jeff your biceps are insane.
Anyone else do each of these x2?
i have bean doing this for 90 days now no change at all pls help me jeff
Does it work on someone who has some belly fat?
I find myself reaching extinction points because, presumably, of bad form or coordination. My neck or lower back hurts or my balance collapses, and thus I have to stop. Feels like I don’t even get to the abs yet. Does it get better?
How many time should you do this on a day?
Now i can’t focus. Starring at the Skeleton 😂😂☝🏾
If u want to send this rubbish back u can't find the return address or contact number
My shoulders hurt threading, any tips?
After you finish training can you reward yourself with a large chocolate milkshake 😋 ??? Or, would that defeat the whole purpose 🤔 😁😁

made me sweat a lot shi
Should your core ache after the workout
1:40
@1:40
I couldn’t do the last exercise is there any alternatives ???
So, this workout almost takes me around 12 minutes everyday day. Does it make sense?
I am recovering from a modest but long term shoulder injuring. I am working with a physical therapist to make my recovery as efficient as possible. I have been watching your videos for a month and I am inspired by the science behind your advice as well as the results you have been able to achieve. I hope you continue to post content. I am going to start the 22 day an workout and then start the 22-day bicep workouts next week. Once I am able to fully commit to these, I am going to modify my workouts to included the dead lifts and focus on proper form for my squats. Thank you for what you are doing to affect the lives of others.
It's a really good work out
Are you able to do this everyday and see results?
I’m going to do this and do the days thing that everyone else is doing.    Day 1: obviously I didn’t see any difference but I definitely did feel a burn and sweat a little   Day 2:
STARTING THIS FROM TODAY...I JUST HOPE I COMPLETE 22 DAYS...WISH GUYS...
How long to rest between each exercise
Hi im at day 3 and I still cant do a extinction set to the last second/rep is this okay and I just keep going?
Cold pal

I started on monday June 20th,  no belly to get rid of per say, I have what I would call the wanna be 4 pack, its sorta there and with any kind of effort it should pop if I cut out my sugar intake. Here is my journey so far, figured documenting the process and posting the journey might keep me motivated a bit more to keep at it and reach 22 days!  Day 1 after workout: This isnt so bad, maybe I didnt do it right. Was also trying to get the hang of a few exercises, exercises 1 and 2 I won an extra round. Day 2 morning: Oh god why, the beach is gonna get whatever body i give it, it hurts and work is gonna suck  Day 2 night: stop being a pussy, lets go discpline, let's do it! Was in pain still, I couldnt reach extinction on exercises 1 and 2, last 2 exercises were brutal and couldnt do much. Decided to compensate with 2x 1min plank, no clue if it was benificial but I figured there was no way I was getting off easy. Day 3 morning: Nope nope nope, god the pain. Still hurts. Laughing hurts, coughing hurts, just getting off the couch was brutal. Wonder if that will go away in the 22 days with no rest. Day 3: Workout started in pain but I was more motivated than yesterday. Earned myself 2 extra rounds of heels to heaven and an extra round of step through the planks. By the time I got to SttPlank, the pain was no longer there and it felt better. Xman crunch, made it 12, then a big 3. Jack knife was worst than usual, didnt reach 45 sec. Decided to go for another round anyways just in case and a big 10 secs later i was tapping out. Stationary bike finished me off. Workout is done and I feel a lot better in terms of pain than before I started the workout tonight. Lets do it guys! Day 4 morning: To be Updated.
Alright. Let’s do this! June 9 22 days
I am going to use this as well as the "Flat stomach" routine for 22 days, and see what happens.
Number 5 is impossible
Are you at Bears Fit?!
Just to clarify, if you fail on a set, go immediately to the next exercise? No rest? By the time, I’m getting to jack knifes, I’m getting about 3 per side. Then bicycles are hopeless.
how many seconds rest between each different exercise?
2:13
Great morning & grand rising! Going a run to the track and will add this immediately!! Thank you sir!!
Hey guys, I've given this ab workout a try for about 2 weeks now, and I definitely see significant improvement in the definition of my abs. I am lucky to have already been at low bodyfat (at around 8-9%) so I saw results a bit quicker as well as having good nutrition, but none the less my abs still need improvement. You'll see results with this if you stay consistent, make sure to breathe properly on every rep and youll feel the burn. I also do it everyday.  I plan on sticking with this workout for the long term, its simple, quick but challenging. Give it a go, defo worth it.  Tldr: imo youll get results if you give it a try, have good nutrition/hydration, and manage to push through the burn. Goodluck
Day 1 - thought I was gonna have abs straight away and shocker, I didn’t. It’s 10 pm and I have a 5k at 8am so I probably should have done this earlier
day 5
very good
Are you in a bio lab ??🤣
I've finished day 1 but not feeling sore is it okay
Great abs workout
I enjoyed the video I'll definitely give this my best...thanks.
I found this video very useful I don't think it will be easy but it looks helpful
If you can’t complete it, don’t repeat it
16 year old workout plan please
Good comrade!!
do I need any kind of warm up for this? can I just go for it?
I wan't abs but my stomach is so huge like that you see on Rick Ross. Still possible?
Just did this in khakis
Gonna be starting this from tomorrow. I'll keep you guys updated ✌🏻
No rest? Not there yet. All times and reps done? Not there yet. But... I am coming ;-)  I've tried a few, but this one just stuck with me. I am in a mood to do it, and that matters :-)
I’m going to start this work out today (5/1/22). I hope I get my abs within a month cuz going on vacation next month lol. I’ll be coming back to this video Avery day to keep you guys updated.
Best ab workout ever. Question, do I have to keep the order? By the time I get to the jack-knife I can barely do them so I'm definitely not getting the most benefit out of that movement, although I can do the stationary bike after...
Well:  day one, literally flopped on most lol but I tried, infrastructure is needed lol. Will be updating tomorrow.
anyone just seeing this as an ad???
I will post my transformation video after 22 days
This is greath,thank you so much!😃 hi from Serbia
Not being that skeleton is quite killing your gains!
I already have the outline of my abs and obliques, core muscles are also visible. Will I be able to get clear abs in 22 days with this workout and proper diet?
I have a question so I’m barely starting to workout my abs and stuff so tell me do I also have to limit my eating or does that rlly not matter ?
Okay guys starting my 22 days right now wish me luck
Yo the last one is pretty difficult me doing till 13 sec stomach pain occurred
Thank you very much for all of your videos bro really help full
Is there any problem if I change the order of workout becoz I can’t do the second last workout I may do it if I am doing it in the first position
No Rest ☺️☺️
ETENTENCE 😁
do this workout once or twice a day??
Lol I’m drinking coke while watching this
😆 🤣 😂 😹  take this video down
Doing this for 22 days wish me luck  Day 1 ✔️ Day 2  Day 3  Day 4 Day 5 Day 6 Day 7    Day 8 Day 9 Day 10  Day 11 Day 12 Day 13 Day 14      Day 15 Day 16 Day 17 Day 18 Day 19 Day 20  Day 21 Day 22
Day 4.
Thread the needle hurts my shoulder what else can I do?
Well its day 1... again 😪😄
Can I Repeat the Whole Workout or does it Have to be the individual Exercise then move on  I personally want to do 3 Whole Exercise Rounds
Was trying to figure out a good amount of sets per week for abs but this is perfect I'll do it! 😊
I'm going to start this workout and tell y'all if this works  Day 1: could only do 2-3 sets, abs hurted like hell but it was worth it
I have a program I got from a physical therapist, but thinking of making it harder.  This was helpful.   Thank you
Im a fan of ur words
How many rounds are you supposed to do for each exercise?
The reward for good work, is more work…love it
nice
For the jackknifes, I don’t have the ability to come up on the crunch enough. It’s too difficult to get that high off the ground
Holy f*ck these hurt so good 💦
Repeating the challenge again, starting date: 26.01.22 Day 1 - 26.01 ✅ Day 2 - 27.01 ✅ Day 3 - 28.01 ✅ Day 4 - 29.01 skipped (will add another day) Day 5 - 30.01 ✅ Day 6 - 31.01 ✅
Day 1
The jack knife takes some getting used to, which means I have to work harder. Thanks for doing this
Can we alternate your two ''22 days to abs'' routines rather than doing the same one everyday? Will it make a difference?
Was thinking of getting a routine like this 4 seconds before finding this. Youtube uo to some spycraft i swear
Going to try this.
Love this vid (and Jeff’s channel)! 4 years too late; I’m gonna give this a try. More to follow…💪🏼😬
I just dont feel the second one at all in my abs, how do i know i do it right
If you need confirmation, i did this two years ago and im back again to get those results i saw in less than 22 days. Legit looked this up again cuz i just know its going to work for that definition i want
I started last week and I am pushing very hard this is a very good work out thanks Jeff
can i get some advice on xman crunches i’m am struggling terribly any tips are appreciated
I'm doing this again starting on December 29, 2021. For context, I'm a slim 6'2" 18 year old  Day1 - very sore after this. I recall the first few days I was very sore Day 2 - I had pretty low extinction times because my muscles were sore from yesterday. Still, a good workout. Day 3 - again low extinction times Day 4 - my lower abs are decimated. heels to the heaven is practically impossible Day 5 - I did the other 22 ab challenge set of work out in order to switch it up. It went well. My lower abs are still very weak. Idk why. Day 6 - ✅ Day 7 - ✅ Day 8 - ✅ the workouts just suddenly got easier - I can see slightly more ab definition Day 9 - missed Day 10 - missed, I needed the rest anyway. This will be better long run Day 11 - ✅ Day 12 - ✅ Day 13 - ✅
I'm only 3 days in, and man, I am so sore. After day 1 I had muscles hurting that I didn't even know I had, but now on day 3, it hurts to just walk. Everything feels like it's engaging my core. Hopefully it gets easier! Especially doing 22 days without any time to really heal.
I started this yesterday I just finished todays exercise 12/25 … 1/15 will be my 22 days hold me accountable please n thanks.
I’m doing this and a bunch of other ab workouts from Jeff daily
I’m going to do this for 2 weeks straight and I will tell you guys my results if there is any.
Help me stay on track guys. I've started this challenge several times and have yet to complete it. Day 1 ✅ Day 2 ✅ Day 3 ✅ Day 4 ✅ Day 5 ✅ Day 6 ✅ Day 7 ✅
DO A CALORIE DEFICIT
Thanks Jeff I have gone to heavens.
Let’s go day 1✅ little tired

12/2/21🎄 Day 1 ✅ I got this
Didn't realize how weak my abs/core had gotten til I tried these. Started yesterday. We'll see how much I improve in a few weeks.
day 1✅
Some of these excercises are most difficult to her a grasp in the first place
I have a hard time doing the step through plank because of my leg injury. Any alternatives?
Should i do this workout once a day or twice ?
Make sense I find this video helpful
Awesome workout
Fam. How you contort ur body like that wtf
Day 1 ✅: This is tuff not gonna lie im sore already and out of breath
Hey, there's 0 rest between each excesise right? Even if you're exhausted?
Im gonna do this one day on one day off so it will be 44 days
22 days Arm how do you I have pain
Another insane workout plan from Jeff, the Legend. I am finishing up one of Jeff's workout plan 'AthleanX Breakout ' which is one hell of a 3 month program. I have achieved breakout in every single core excercises ! Cant wait to do this immediately after !
Hi Jeff love your channel. I'm 53 do crossfit need some tips to pick on some muscle. Thanks in advance
Okay so i started this challenge from 8/11/2021 My height is 5.10 and my weight is 76kg I will also tell you guys about my diet   Day 1: Done  Breakfast: 3egg whites and i added tomatoes and onion in it with two brawn breads Lunch: Salad and grilled chicken Dinner: Brawn rice with fried vegetables  Day 2: Done and my abs are sore  Same meal as yesterday  Day 3: Okay so i can do the first exercise for more than 45 seconds but obliques exercise is killing me i hardly can do 6 of each side  Same meal Day 4: Done,Also i am doing cardio for last couple of days  Breakfast was same  Lunch: Sweet potatoes and salad Dinner: Beef steak Day 5: Done and some exercises are becoming easier  Breakfast: 3 boiled eggs with coffee Lunch:beef steak  Dinner: Rice and fish  Day 6: Done  Same meal as yesterday  Day 7: Done and surprisingly today i felt so tired while doing the workout Breakfast: Oats with slim milk Lunch: Salad and sweet potato Dinner: Solomon Day 8: Done and now i can do x man crunches more than 12  Breakfast: 3egg whites with bread  Lunch: Salad with chicken breast Dinner: Grilled fish Day 9: Done but today again it was hard Same breakfast Lunch: Rice with chicken and boiled vegetables  Dinner: Chicken boiled  Day 10: Done and i have lost 1.8 kgs Same meal  So after 10 days i can see my upper abdomen is becoming leaner and my waist is reduced like half inch
Day 1 ✅ Day 2❌ Day 3 ✅ Day 4 ✅ Day 5 ✅ Day 6 ❌ Day 7 ✅
I have 13% body fat and I'm Preety much underweight by 4/5 kgs can I have abs I used to go to gym and got like good biceps and stuff so can I get abs by doing this workout.
I've been doing various 10 min + or - ab workouts and find this one really excellent. I am 56 y.o. female trying to build and maintain strength. This  workout felt safe and I will do it for 22 days!
Its taking me sometime don't know what I'm doing wrong
22 days let's work 💪🏾
I had a six pack so I had that while watching.
Do U have to do all of the exercise together like in one go or can u do them throughout the day ?
How do you move to the second workout if you keep getting the first one done
Fuck it nothing else to do, I’ll come back every day and edit how many days it’s been. Day 1: kinda tough doable tho Day 2: pretty tough, my stomach is pretty damn sore
I'm having problem with exercises involving plank, how do I overcome it?
Day @ Abs failed on jackknifes but it's ok
Believe in God and Jesus and spread the gospel and word of God and Jesus not trying to force it on you ❤️❤️🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏❤️🙏❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Like most guys these days, I spent a lot of time in the gym trying to get abs and make them show and I had only marginal success.  And then at the age of 45 I got myself an inversion table and did 3 sets of 10-12 reps before every workout.  I also was riding my bicycle 3 or 4 times a week for 45 minutes and within a few weeks I had abs like I had never had before and it really was much easier than most of the things I had tried over the years.  I think Jeff is terrific and I love this channel, I'm not disagreeing with what he's saying, just adding my personal experience :)
Thank you.
I’ve started today but I’m doing it in alternate days for personal reasons.  LET’S GO!!  Day 1: all good but exercise 5 is extremely challenging. I only managed to do it for 30 seconds, so I increased stationary bike up to 45sec.
“Nobody is getting away with an easy workout here” .. I love it haha!
Day 1 i feel pretty good it hurt a bit but see you tomorow!
let's go starting tomorrow after work because I gassed myself at the gym this morning
I'm going to try this today after work!!!!
Day 2
Hello, I took the challenge, but i have a question :) I use nutritions, im working out 5 days a week. After coming back from gym, whatever part of my muscle  I do there, i do this challenge at home. I have a travel time ~1 hour from gym - home and im wondering, when is the best time to use the nutritions? I hope you can help me with that :)
Doing this workout every day for the 22 days, and hopefully more (someone interact with this in some way pls so I don't forget)
Im starting this today i will update daily wish me luck
cinnamon and cross legs and push knees
So if you can last 45 seconds then 10 seconds and go back to the same exercise until you cannot? I am a planking athlete and was looking for some workouts and it gets boring training myself. So would give this a shot
Alr I'm gonna be consistent with this so DAY 1:did everything 5 Times and will be doing this everyday consistently
Day one:☑️ Day two:☑️ Day three:☑️ Day four:☑️ Day five:☑️ Day six:☑️
I can do the others 3 rounds each except for jack knife cant even do it 20 secs straight 🤣
can i do it 11 times for 2 days?
Day 1: very difficult due to wrestling workouts. Barely made it through lol
Day 1: I had to stop most reps because I had pain in my lower back, not the burn in my abs. I am going to continue, am I doing something wrong?
Love from india
Thanks for the help, Your hard work idea is working, I aim on my 10 days.
Followed by progression ab training? Is that another entirely different program or set of exercises?
I was sweating watching this
Perfect name of this challenge should be: "Victim of your own success", because that's exactly what this is. "You just earned yourself 10 more reps"... Rip
How many sets?
I’m gonna try it I’m trying to pull some girls number
Not gonna lie I did this 1 week and my abs came back
Im using this for a cosplay thx
I went to day 8 on this exercise but I'm thinking of switching to one of his other 22day workouts as I believe my body is too used to this
This is all good and well but to get to your body fitness, its diet and mindset. People wont see any muscle tone, if they are carrying 20lbs upwards of body fat. Until we can see the true slim self or at least most of the fat disappear, we cant see the affects of this workout on our abs. Says the 55 year old over weight lack of any tone..lol
12 M 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳😘🥳😘🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
Has anyone noticed any results??? Please let me know
do this at the end of a workout?
Kyle Shannahan is lookin yoked!!
It’s a new month Is coming up and I’m going to have a crack at this for my own health and well being, I got a large belly and I want to build on core strength for the abdominal wall to be an absolute machine under all my fat, so I don’t worry about a hernia when skipping or doing jumping jacks.
Me who doesn’t want to do another set and jus quits at 44 sec oops 🤷🏽‍♂️
Hey I don't comment often but this workout has been amazing for me. Definitely works. I started with the 22 days and now I do it before every workout. I appreciate you creating this! I would love to see some other variation that I can incorporate to switch it up a little bit. Depending on how I'm feeling it can last between five and ten minutes. The whole extinction concept has been an absolute game changer for me.
I hit it from the bakeek
Ok day 5 complete still have a big beer belly ill keep ya posted
Jeff looks like he would be an awesome wide receiver!
Just did my first day pretty tiring but I'm gonna keep going I'm gonna keep you guys updated on my progress and see how far how I can go whish me luck 😁
Day 2 of this and I’m slightly sore already.
Wayy to advanced
Im 293 lbs in 22 days will I be seeing abs
1. 2.
The Jack Knife part is hard. I can't finish a single set of this exercise !
3:53  i think that i broke my shoulder
Day 22 complete however I put on 6 lbs over the past 22 days, not sure what I did wrong??
You're my type looking at your abs 😍 you make me feel like a Princess 👑 I dare you call me Princess Chrissy
Can women do this too ?
I've just started the challenge soo we are going yo see if it works or not,see you in 22 days.
Day1: Couldn't even start the stationary bike lmao
Or we have to do this 2 ou 3 circle
I didn’t understand. You have to do each exercises reps until you can’t ?
This is my next opportunity if my 30 day six pack is done
62 years old just started watching I thought I was in pretty good shape, ouch these work out show me other wise.   I like that you put a little humor into your videos Jessie's transformation helps even someone my age to keep going....
Day 1 ✅
Day 14: I've been working out my abs for 14 days straight and I think I am about to either die or ascend.
Gonna start from tomorrow Ill make update everyday make sure to check it out (if have an advice plz give me) Day 1-✅(fully sweaty its hard did 5+ sets for first 3 ex can't do xman crunch and last one)
👍
🦾💪💥✊💯
Anybody got tips for doing the jack knives
Amazing workout
Did it 22, beach time longer because it became easier around 35 min but could do it longer. Great results.thanks Jeff!! My second 22 challenge with Jeff. I would love another challenge but shorter watch day?? Could I get same results?
What is the best way to work your chest muscles at home with no weights
Alright i am starting today 21 juli 2021 day 1: Completed
Today is my day #1 and my abs are already burning 💪 will come back after 22 days to let you all know how it went, so excited 🙌
I've been following for about a week and I can actually see slight definition on my mid section. I do hanging leg raises instead of heals to heavens and russian twists instead of thread the needle every alternate day to add some variation. I currently weigh 70 kgs at 15% bodyfat and I can definitely say that this does work.
Deff gonna try this!
Imma try
is it a bad idea to be doing these on marble floor? im on my secind day and my lower back bone aches from the pressure. Or is it simply because of bad form?
That skeleton in the background can tell you this exercise is a real killer.
I came her months ago and that time I decided to do that workout..  But until Now I haven't done it..  But I'll start now hope I do it .
Day 1. Let’s get after it.
How many times do you do this in a day?
Challenge accepted i start tomorrow
Xposition
Don’t know if i’m doing it right because the thread the needles bother my shoulders
I dont feel anything in my abs while doing the 2. Exercise can anyone help me ?
Grat workout, but IT takes much longer than the traditional 7-10 min! Today my second day I did 24min but honestly with the first and second i could have done more than 5 series...
Hello there love the video. How offen do you recommend to workout on abs?  Thank you.
Should we train our abs daily ??
Yeah what kind of sucks is that the workout only gets longer, not harder I am now at almost an hour of ab training every morning and it gets really demotivating
I told Siri to set a timer for 45 seconds and she said “45 minutes and counting” and I said huhhhhh
Gain my first showing abs with this challenge! Tnx!
I'm just coming to the end of my first week, doing this in the morning along with some stretches to correct my posture, all in all with this and stretches, it takes me around 20+/- mins hopefully when I start hitting extinction in this will coincide with no longer needing to stretch as much so time should remain the same. My body fat I'd estimate to be around 20% so I'm a fair way off seeing gains in this area but already seeing an increase in stamina every day.  Will keep doing this for 22days absolute minimum, but I'm sure I will be in for the long term, my first thoughts are thread the needle is brutal, I by far find this one the hardest, and with Jack knifes, Jeff makes it look easy, I can't seem to find my rhythm or movement with it, I sort of look like I'm doing a crunch/bike/stroking my quad type motion all out of sync 🤣 hopefully the movement comes more naturally soon!
Mask off, let's do it. 22 days. Here we go .
Day 1       Day 2 day 3
Hi Jeff, I would say I'm not beginner in ab work out, I mean no expert butI do abs work out everyday.  However, someday I do feel too much pressure, or eventually pain, in my mid back or lower back (less in lower back).  Especially when I do V-up, seem like my mid back got so tense.  Do you have any suggestion?  Thanks a lot
Great stuff!!!
How much rest in between exercises? Let's say I made it through a full set of heels to heaven, I rested 10 seconds and then I failed midget, how much do I rest before the next exercise?
4 days in and I still can’t do the last two to extinction this is kicking me so hard
Since I dont see anyone else did it, I'll do it. 1. 1:50 heels to the heavens, 45 second per rep, 10 sec rest and repeat if completed previous set. 2. 2:40 step through planks, 45 second per rep, 10 sec rest and repeat if completed previous set. 3. 3:20 x man crunches, 12 reps, 10 sec rest and repeat if completed previous set. 4. 3:54 alternating thread the needle, 10 reps each side, 10 sec rest and repeat if completed previous set. 5. 4:48 alternating jackknifes, 45 seconds per rep, 10 sec rest and repeat if completed previous set. 6. 5:24 stationary bikes, 30 seconds per rep, 10 sec rest and repeat if completed previous set.
How much set to do each exercise
Imma start this today.  Day 1- 👍🏽. But I couldn’t do all the exercises more than once. Day 2- 👍🏽. Did each excercise twice.
Started this workout 1 month ago .... After 10 days my abs were visible and on day 30 I have perfect abs as I want....thanks for the amazing exercises bro 👍

All you need is ATHLEAN-X and FitnessFAQs
Should I be doing this with my regular workout? I feel like it may be too much if im already using gym equipment along with doing these everyday. Please someone tell me I’m wrong.
Alright im strarting this on june 8th 2021 and my goal is 1st september , so just about 3 months , hopefully i dont give up ill keep you updated
🤩💪
i very much doubt this will work however i’m up for giving it a good go. i’ll update for anyone who cares👍🏼
Thread the needle was insane, I couldn't even complete a proper set on  my first day
Hello, I've done this 22 days routine, after that, I had no idea of what to do next, so I stuck to this as a daily routine in order to improve again. I am also a basketball player and this helps me a lot to improve my explosivity. I would like to know if doing this every day can bring injuries? Thank you very much for the shared knowledge.
Day one done : 1. 5 / 2. 3 / 3. 1 / 4. 1 / 5. 1 / 6. 1
Day 5 so far, defiantly not as sore as the first 3 days of pain. Can feel my midsection strengthening and getting tighter already. Will update after 22 days 🤙  Edit: around 2 weeks of doing this, missed one day. Couldn’t complete anything on here for one round but heels to the heavens now can do 2 sets of everything here, feel a lot stronger. Back and core is definantly tighter and leaner. Will keep going even after 22 days
MALE AGE 30 5'9 165 LBS SKINNY/FAT BODY.  DAY 1 ✅ DAY 2 ✅ DAY 3 ✅ DAY 4 ✅ DAY 5 ✅ TODAY SEEMED EASIER THAN THE FIRST 4. DAY 6 ✅ DAY 7 ✅ DAY 8 ✅ DAY 9 ✅
Are your abs really painful after this workout?
Who tried to do workouts like this to get ready for a fight tomorrow and trying to impress your crush💀😂
Can we do daily this and workout ? Is there any problem ?
3:30 looks hard hard  hard
• Day 1 - ✅ I'm quite weaker than I thought. Body fat percentage around 20. Not really any well defined muscle mass •Day 2 - ✅ •Day 3 - ✅ sh*t it's actually really harder than I thought •Day 4 - ✅ after just 4 days my abs have become more visible (just a tiny bit more, still counts) looking forward to this!!! •Day 19 - ✅ yeah I did skip some days, get too tired to workout some days...  I replied down there about how it's going on. I did some research all these days and got this from every reliable source I could find, that one month abs gaining routines are extremely unrealistic, maybe even impossible for our body. Well if you're already really fit and just in need of some extra polishing then it'll work. But to those of us who are not really fit, we have to persevere for quite some time to get the body we desire. And yeah, like it or not, whatever you do, good eating is even more important than workout, so give attention to that too
i go to the beach in 23 days😐
But I thought training them every day was bad? It is said that you should train them every other day so they can recover and grow properly,so I'm confused now?
wonder how you can use the force on your abs but i always hurt my neck trying too hard to stay up on stationary bikes
I have had abs ALLWAYS!!! but under 😂😂😂... I will do da challenge, will see if its gooooood 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
I can't do thread and needle
is abs even a real thing ?
even though he is a very hardcore and famous trainer he still struggles. What a guy!!!!
I start today 5/14/2021 1st-✔️ (I can't move anything anymore) 2nd-✔️ (my arms are bruised from the training from yesterday and today) (I'm doing all of the things in the video on a carpet that might be why) 3rd-✔️ (I wasn't able to do the jack knives but still stuck to the program) 4th-✔️ (I wasn't able to do the first exercise bcz of my muscles soreness neither the 5th one) 5th-✔️ (I was able to do again the first exercise and tried a bit of the fifth one also, feeling good) 6th-✔️  (All exercises were easier to be made than before, i'm holding strong yee) 7th-✔️ (no complains at all, beside that I still can't do the fifth exercise all was done pretty good) 8th-✔️ (Today i really passed up my limits especially at the first exercise, I can see this training is really improving myself) 9th-✔️  (No words for today) 10th-✔️ 11th-✔️ (I'm able to do almost triple than I was able in the first day) 12th-✔️ 13th-✔️ 14th-✔️ 15th-✔️(Got to be honest, never hated myself more than I just now for my inability to push my limits on some exercises) 16th-✔️ 17th-✔️ (I'm still not able to do the fifth exercise) 18th-✔️ 19th-✔️ 20th-✔️ 21th-✔️ (Today was the easiest day since i begun this program, i really advanced at all exercises and my resistence is much better) 22th-✔️ (My abs can be seen a little after all of this training and in the pics on one side is actually perfect.)
Starting this tomorrow
Love handles is the main problem of mine
Has anyone actually done this? I’m doing it but like on intermediate mode. I just have A LOT of body fat that’s all I really have.(Reply if y’all want me to update y’all)

Nigga ima get my abs back. Fuck Bulking😂
I’d I did this it not be visible but it be there under the fat
Please get rid of the Nike shoes.
Definitely going to give it a try!
Don't have the attention span for this one 6 Rounds 1st one possibly could've done more but got bored and wanted to move onto next exercise. I need them to give me baseline numbers so I know if I'm in bad or good range. Then I feel like I'm getting an atta girl or horrible so I self shame and do it.
Starting today! -88KG-
Done this for atleast 22 days (I didn't count since I consider this is something i'm going to do for the rest of my life). Don't have the abs yet but that's because there is still some excess bodyfat left. However i'm starting to the sixpack definitions and that feeling is AWESOME! Weighed in this morning at 74,2 KG with 15,1% bodyfat. Trying to reach 70kg and 14%
Day1:
Finally taking on all of Jeff's advice and seeing real results. Still at beginner level but Jeff has never let me down. Everything he says has worked on my body.
If anyone likes this comment everyday, I'll make sure to come back everyday!
I am 183 and 95 kilograms I do workout but not that much I'll try to give you guys enough information I'll diet at the same time too
3 years ago I was 14 and did it fo like 17-20 days but got strep throat and stop but this defined them a bit frl
Can I exchange the heals heavens bcz I have pain in my knee due to surgery?
Yes
Okay this is my second go at that routine, I've fallen far from where I began and I'm going to try again. Day 1: I could do most of the exercises one set, but the starfish crunch and jackknives kicked my ass. I couldn't do any twice. Progress: sweaty and belly.
Is one set enough or you gotta do like 2 -3 of em ??
I step today 26-03-22
Will be doing this becouse i'm sick of getting made fun of for being chubby 😗  (Starting 2021/04/1) I managed to do it for 2 days but then my brother got home and i couldn't do it in front of him becouse it's way too embarrassing for me 😭 (i'll be restarting tommorow)  (Restarted 2021/04/08)  Day 1 ☑️ Day 2 ☑️ Day 3 Day 4 Day 5 Day 6 Day 7  Day 8 Day 9 Day 10 Day 11 Day 12  Day 13 Day 14 Day 15 Day 16 Day 17 Day 18 Day 19 Day 20 Day 21  Day ²²
I can hardly do the second one becouse my arms are too weak 😔✊
Other bodybuilders while shooting : see this muscle is getting affect  Jeff : his muscles says see I'm myself getting contracted
Teacher: i will give u an anatomy dummy for u to study..... Student: no ma'am u take me to Jeff, we can see all muscles in a human body😂
Jeff how should we do it.. abs first or jumping rope first ?
1:55 2:43 3:21 3:54 4:48  5:26 Dont mind my bookmarks :)
gonna keep doing this for 22 days!! update every week:)
Challenge excepted going to try this out. I'm sick of my gut time to put in the work.
I can't do any of these 😢
any diets?
I feel like I missed something - what are the rest periods between exercises? Not the extinction rest periods but how long should you rest when moving from "heels to the heavens" to "step through planks" for example?  No rest? The same 10 second rest? 2 minutes?
Here I go today I am going to start this. I will update everyday. Saying it in the comment section will hopefully motivate me to finish it.
should we take rest after each workout or just continue with the next workout?
I'm on a day 1 and i can barely make the half of the exercises
For six pack you have to lose weight first or not?
Am Very Slim And People Make Very FuN On Me. 😭😭
Sir. I need to speak to u. Please 🙏

Damn, got so bored in quarantine that i went and watched Lewandowski exercise in front of an unvaccinated kid
am going to start tomorrow ill let u know how it went in 22 days
I started My WorkOut From Today  Lets see 😋
Am I supposed to feel the burn in my core after the first day because I felt it more in my shoulder and legs. Does that mean I did them wrong because i don’t think I did  Edit 2 days later: I absolutely regret saying that because my abs have been so sore I feel it when I stand up straight. And if I try to do a sit-up I can’t go further than an inch
Him: "Great job you just earned yourself another 10 reps to each side  Me: "but I dont wanna"
Well all the Prides are happening this year, so time to get the bod on
Is there anyway i can make this harder heals to heaven i did nonstop 10 min straight very low sign of fatigue.
Gonna start this from tommorow
Jeff probably chews the same amount so there is no different muscle gain in his jaw😅
Imma come to this video every day for 2 months. Day 1/58✅ Day 2-12/58 I dislocated my shoulder❌
Do you do this eveyday?

I'm starting this from today let's see what happens I'm 6'0 and 71kgs
Im doing this!!!
Two typos in my previous post.. 1. Not was supposed to be now.  2. one too may buts.  Sorry
I like this guy.  He feels real genuine and not some meathead pimping a worthless program.  Have been mixing in these exercises to my daily routine for 10 days not and I'm noticing a change. But, maybe I am slow on the uptake, but is Jeff recommending beginning with 1 set of each exercise every day (W Risers, Black Widow, Butterfly crunches,...) or 1 exercise with multiple reps each day with each day being a different exercise (i.e. Heels to heaven  day one, butterfly crunch day two, etc..)?  Anyone care to opine here?  Thanks
Second day here! I’
no pain no gain
Should we do this same exercise everyday for 22days????
I'm gonna do this challenge once a day  Starting weight: 123 Height: 5'5 3/4  Day 1☑️ I don't think I was doing much of it right and I didn't get much reps Day 2☑️ Im getting better but I still cant do 3 of the exercises and I don't know how this course will help my abs Day 3☑️ I can do 2 sets of every exercises besides 2, I feel the same as yesterday My goal for tomorrowis to jack knife for 30 seconds
you are the best
Ill do this 4 times a day

This is lot harder than it looks. Yare yare daze. But not gonna give up !
If I night help to this, for those that are beginners or intermediate and feel like they can’t completion to extinction might I suggest ee adjusting.   Beginner extinction for exercise 1 2 5 and 6 should be 15 seconds  And for exercise 3 and 4 should be 5 reps.   Intermediate for exercises 1 2 5 and 6 should be 30s  And for the exercises 3 and 4 should be 10   Advanced should be this videos extinction.    When starting at beginner try your hardest to get to the next level (intermediate) don’t dwell on the short repetitions and time for long. Give it a week even less if possible for you to make the move to intermediate and same thing for intermediate to move into advance. Don’t dwell on it long. Keep upping until you’re at this videos extinction then try to do what he says “ rest 10 seconds and do it again”
How many sets do we have to do??
You know you have done a good job when after each extinction you have to roll over to use a press up to get off the floor😂🤣👍
Imma try this. :) I’ll make a video and then hashtag this
"Nothing worth having should come easy." Golden words right there.
can we do this workout 7 days a week?
Will this work for kids like 13 years old?
I can’t even sit up on the alternating jackknifes 😑😑
Okey im trying this know
I've gotten the six pack before. I'm getting fat again. How to get my ass from here too the floor.... I remember how to do this.. I just can't seem to get my ass from here to the floor. .. Fk it, I need a cigarette.
Day 1... Thread the needle is super hard but i made it through all the other ones. Gotta focus on form.  Day 2... Got 4 reps of the thread the needle in. Jack knives are also super hard.  Day 3... More control on thread the needle but still only 4 reps. Super sore...wondering if i should be taking a rest day LOL.  DAy 4... still only 4 reps of thread the needle, but mostly because my elbows are hurting from the carpet burn. Feeling a little difference in strength.  Day 5... 5 reps of thread the needle.  Again elbows begin to hurt even though I put a pillow down. The rest I'm starting to go double time on.  Day 6... 7 reps on thread the needle.  Found jack knives super hard today couldn't even do the full 45 secs. Slowly getting stronger..  Day 7... Rest day  Day 8... 9 reps on thread the needle. Jack knives could only go up-to 35 seconds. Stationary bike I did 6min
I'M YOUR SAVIORRRR. I WILL DO THIS. I WILL TELL YOU EVERYTHING. I WILL START TODAY LATER CUZ I'M IN LESSON. I WILL EDIT AND TELL Y'ALL THE RESULTS. I WON'T BE A COWARD!.  Day 1. I'm doing good.

Sabertooth tigers watching trying this circut like I need a rep limit...
How much rest is needed todo next exercise if we are done with the previous one till failure ?
I'm starting right now because my parents said that I'm so fat I need to exercise
I have been going to the gym for a while now, but my parents stopped me, so I've been doing home workouts 70 to 100 pullups, 50 to 100 pushups, and 60 to 100 of another workout, I forgot what it's called. But I have abs and I'm know as one of the top 10 muscular teenagers in the school, but I want to keep going. So I want to gain more muscle and more strength in the abs so I'm going to do this starting tomorrow.

1:55
lets do this! I am not sure what I am up against, but I am not a quitter
I started on April 6th, 2020, and have done it every day (156 days in a row) since then. It’s helped me lose 28 pounds so far! I’m pretty close to abs now. Thank you!
Jeff i do this exercise with wearing t shirt and off the fan for sweat is this good
Day 1: done Day 2: done
I feel like I can get more reps in if I rest for more than 10 seconds in between. Should I take my time to get more reps or is the short break adding a benefit that I am unaware of?
This is my third time doing this work out while having a meal plan. I must say between this, lifting weights, meal plan. I was 155 and now I am down to almost 130. My goal is to hit 122 and its going to happen. Also down 2 waist sizes. Stick with it everyone don't give up.
Just doing ex1 for 45 seconds. Looking at the mirror for 10 minutes.
Starting September 6th My objective is to get ready for basketball. Also exclaimer I'm 13 about to be 14 I get panic attack and have asthma. Also pretty tall bring 5'8 and weigh around 120 pounds. Things I like to do are like playing basketball, gaming, working out and more. So if I can do this you can to I know some people feel like giving up but don't your body will thank you. Thanks for reading and peace ✌ Day 1 ✅ Day 2 ✅ also Labor day Day 3
I love your videos, I watch them whenever I have time. I have what my friends refer to as a  Gorilla gut. Do you have a video that might point me in the right direction, I would really like to shave it down if even a little.
Guys, what rest time between each exercise?
Im new to working out and have been working out for about 7 weeks now. For abs I previously did chris Heria every ab routine for about 2 weeks but seen little improvement however I have now done this workout everyday for about 25 days and have only missed about 3 days of doing it. I can say my abs have proper definition and are in the best shape they’ve ever been. I have kinda the outline of a 4 pack and hopefully continuing this routine I’ll achieve better. However along side this I have been working out 5 times a week so take that into consideration as well and I’m naturally slim so didn’t take long to see my ab outlines. I’m going to continue this workout and will edit my post in a couple weeks time to inform u of my progress.
Day 1 : ✔ (made Mistakes will add day) Day 2 : ✔ Day 3 : ✔ Day 4 : ✔ Day 5 : ✔ Day 6 : ✔ Day 7 : ✔ Day 8 : ✔ Day 9 : ✔ Day 10 : ✔ (did it kinda wrong will add day) Day 11 : ✔ Day 12 : ✔ Day 13 : ✔ Day 14 : ❎ ( working on fixing realtionhip with God yall should to ,will add day) Day 15 :  ✔ Day 16 : ❎ Day 17 : ❎ Day 18 : ✔ Day 19 : ✔ Day 20 : ✔ Day 21 : ✔ Day 22 : ✔ Day 23 :  Day 24 : Day 25 : Day 26 : Day 27 :

Can anyone explain the stationary bike a bit more for me? Whenever I do it, I never have enough room to rotate my elbows side to side because my knees/legs get in the way. I have my knees at that ~90 degree angle and fairly parallel to the ground, but still, it doesn’t work out for me :/
Trying now

Do we have to take rest between 2 different excercise?
Guys am I the only one that is not getting sore from these exercises like the first day I was sore from the x man crunches but when I got to day 3 I wouldn't get sore from anything I'm pretty sure I can do 100+ x man crunches without getting sore is that normal
Skinny 13 year old gonna start today like so I can come back  -day 1 ✅  - day 2 -
This is the only way I can encourage myself to not give up  Day 1 ✅  Day 2 ✅  Day 3 ✅  Day 4 ✅  Day 5 ✅  Day 6:❎ Today was the champions league final and there was no way I was missing it  Day 7: ✅  Day 8: ❎  Day 9: ❎  Day 10: ✅  Day 11: ✅  Day 12: ✅  Day 13: ✅  Day 14: ✅  Day 15: ✅  Day 16: ✅  Day 17: ✅  Day 18: ✅  Day 19: ✅  Day 20: ✅  Day 21: ✅  Day 22: ✅ I still don't have abs, but because I missed 3 days I'm going to do it 3 more days.  Day 23: ✅  Day 24: ✅ one day to go  Day 25: ✅  I could see some minimal results. I definitely can see that my abs poped up a bit but not much
Alright so I like already started this but I’m seeing everyone else is like making reports so I will too    Day 1: I mean I already see my first 2 abs coming in so I’m trying to engage myself into this. Ok it was hard I’ll admit didn’t have perfect form and couldn’t do the star thing where u make ur arms and legs touch but got it done ✅   Day 2: My form is increasing and I’m doing good I managed to do 5 of the star things but still need to work on my form and I can’t do the last workout but I’m still going for it everything else is good but I find the second workout boring I mean sure it burns but I find it boring but if it’ll help say no more ✅  Day 3: I can do 7 of the star things but I can’t do the last workout I can’t get my shoulder blades off the ground Idk how to do it ✅   Day 4: managed to the star workout and a half of it as well, Doing well but can’t do the last workout ✅  Day 5: Im doing good so far I’m planning to replace my last workout with something else because I don’t see myself fixing this anytime soon and it’s a waste of me just attempting and giving up on it but trust I’m not giving up✅  Day 6: Couldn’t do it today but I managed to do what I can  Day 7: Really hurting today lol the workout has gotten easier for me and I can see major improvement Btw I had some abs showing before I started this I can see 4 but they are beginning to show easier and plus without flexing as much I’m hyped!!!!  I also skipped the needle workout for today since I find it boringgggg I mean I feel some pain but I’m going to skip  it for today and replace it with sum else✅  Day 8: Got it done ✅  Day 9: Couldn’t do it   Day 10: I have really sore legs so I’ll do what I can  Kk so I don’t exactly know where I am rn but ima assume I’m on day 11 Cuz like I stopped for a bit to continue volleyball training so yeah I’ll continue  Day 11: I did it but I’m going to really push myself tmrw   I stopped at day 17 cuz school and stuff but yeah it helped and can basically see a shadow of my 4 pack
Guys I've actually done day 10 i forgot to write about my other days i just wanted to let you guys know after 10 days i can literally see my body transformation and my abs are becoming more visible don't give up guys

Do not understand, why dislike. Motivation is one that keeps one trying, many people stay on their comfort zone, but if you have the will to do it, this is one of the  best abdominal exercise yet. You start with your own pacing. Some people just do not appreciate it most probably right on even when they are just beginners, they wish they can do better than the coach. Keep on, sir!!
Decided to do this Day 1: did it even tho it hurt like hell Day 2: done - alright not that bad lol Day 3: rest day (will add one to the end) Day 4: done Day 5: donr
Starting today...lets see..!!
I am from India I am your biggest fan
i have abs a - a b - big s - stomach
Guys I will start this tomorrow so please leave some comments to help me out. I will update every day.  Day 1:Done Day 2:Done Day 3:Done Day 4:Done Day 5: I was busy and could not complete it I will add a extra day Day 6: Done Day 7: Done Day 8: Done Day 9: I forgot to do it I will add a extra day Day 10: Done Day 11: Day 12: Day 13: Day 14: Day 15: Day 16:
I’m starting day 1 one today!!
What's the hardest exercise for you guys? The hardest one for me is the alternating jacknives...
Now I'm either getting out of this ripped aff or I'm coming out dead
I just count the reps instead of time with a 10 second break. No timer necessary
Day 20 - still doing my 7687th set of leg raises, didn't rest. 2 more days to go.
Hii from today I am starting it. I am 16 years young..today is 12August,2020 Day1-
Lacasa de papel (Money Heist) , Rio's brother is this guy 😂😂..
Day 1 done I will edit this comment every time hehe   Day 2 its ok but  I have  a bit long to go   Day 3  ok I feel like this isnt worth it tbh but yeah ima do my own training
I work as a dentist and this guy always comes for his checkups without a shirt on
Alright I’m doing this and by the end of the month I will have somewhat of abs!! Day 1: ✔️  Day 2: ✔️ Day 3: ✔️ Day 4: ✔️ Day 5: ✔️ Day 6: ✔️ Day 7: ✔️ So since I’ve done it for a week I thought I’d share my thoughts. I haven’t been really sore but have progressively gotten more tired each day 😬. Hopefully I improve on these exercises but for now I‘m feeling good about being more active! Day 8: ✔️ Day 9: ✔️ Day 10: ✔️ Day 11: ✔️ Halfwayyyyy Day 12: ✔️ Day 13: ✔️ Day 14: ✔️ So for the second week, I can see that a lot of my stomach fat has gone away and I’ve been making some progress on the workouts. Day 15: ✔️ Day 16: ✔️ Day 17: ✔️ Day 18: ✔️ Day 19: ✔️ Day 20: ✔️ Day 21: ✔️ Day 22: ✔️ Ahhh I’m done!!  Before doing this workout, I was pretty bloated but still skinny. I lost an inch around my stomach and it’s definitely more toned too. I would recommend this to beginners as it is more friendly than other challenges. It’s also helped me mentally in the way that now I feel odd and lazy if I don’t do a daily workout which is always a good mentality to have! I’m really proud of myself that I did this and I’m doing the Chloe Ting one next so wish me luck! 😂
This guy is the definition of fitness
Day1✅ August 10 2020 (Somewhat difficult but can try to complete) Day2 Day3 Day4 Day5 Day6 Day7 Day8 Day 9 Day10 Day11 Day12 Day13 Day14 Day15 Day16 Day17 Day18 Day19 Day21 Day22
What I do each day   30 push ups  2 min rest 2 minutes bycicle kicks 2 min rest 1 min plank 2 min rest 15 push ups 1 min rest Lifting legs 20 times   3 minutes stretching each muscle in the body   And take rest until next day
Sweet Jesus some of these moves look hard
Are people doing multiple sets of each exercise? If so, how many?
Update (8/17): So I did this for 3 days but simply stopped doing it. I will attempt this again. I’m a real person (not a bot) lmao. I will attempting this challenge and update my results. I’m 24 5’8 145bs, pretty skinny tbh but I have started to hit the gym since quarantine ended (Around June).           Day 1 (8/17): This is my 4th time doing this but since I stopped after day 3 Im starting over. Finished all 6 exercises, still struggling to not take breaks in between.   Day 2 (8/18): Did all 6. Again, still struggling to not take couple second breaks in between. My body just gives up lmao, but at least I finish them.   Day 3 (8/19): Done & sore af lmao.   Day 4: (8/20): X  Day 5: (8/21): X  Day 6: (8/22): Missed 2 days. I will add 2 more days towards the end, however, I will do the exercises twice for the next two days to “make up” for the lost time. I completed day 4 today.   Day 7: (8/23): Did the exercises in the morning. Will do them later tonight.
Thank you for your videos sir, they are helping me re-cover from a fall down stairs which my body became out of line. Feeling better than ever thank you. You explain things easily for everyone.thank you

Better start now than never start at all. Here we got and I'l just put a checkmark if there was nothing special, I'll ellaborate if anything significant happens or if I feel like it. (Im an overweight 140 pound 13 year old if anyone wants to know)  Day 1: Well, as a first day, it was excruciating. I could barely finish the X man crunch and I had terrible form. Lots of room for improvement. Day 2: Day 3: Day 4: Day 5: Day 6: Day 7: Day 8: Day 9: Day 10: Day 11: Day 12: Day 13: Day 14: Day 15: Day 16: Day 17: Day 18: Day 19: Day 20: Day 21: Day 22:
Step 1: Eat at a caloric deficit..
This is the video that got me started bodybuilding 14 months ago. I thought "shoot, I'll commit to  working out for 22 days. I'd love having visible abs".  14 months later and I STILL DON'T HAVE ABS. I worked my abs hardcore virtually every single day for the first 6 months, 30 minutes a session. This video is extremely misleading. Abs are only possible if you cut calories sufficiently enough in addition to working out.   Not only do I not have abs, but for the first time in my life I'm actually fat. I have a big belly, which I thought was impossible being so skinny my entire life.  The only positive side to all of this is that most of me looks great now, especially my chest. But no....no visible abs. I don't regret beginning bodybuilding, but I'm sad that I look bloated all the time now.
I already worked out today so I’m doing this with a diet starting tomorrow.                      Day:1 done Day:2
what about after 22 days, how should I train?
How many times should i do it for a day
Gonna be September back to school in about a month thought I’d try it out so here we go Start August 4th end August 27th Day 1: ✅  Join this journey with me!
I started today August 3rd 2020.                                Day:1 ✅ it was tough couldn’t do every excersise perfect but I liked how it was challenging
So you have to do all of them each day
1:50
Not tryna amass likes, just keeping myself accountable. (Started a few days ago already) Day 1 - 7/27 ✅ Day 2 - 7/28 ✅ Day 3 - 7/29 ✅ Day 4 - 7/30 ✅ Day 5 - 7/31 ✅ Day 6 - 8/1 ✅ Day 7 - 8/2 ✅ Day 8 - 8/3 ✅ Day 9 - 8/4 ✅ Day 10 - 8/5 ✅ Day 11 - 8/6 ✅ Day 12 - 8/7 ✅ Day 13 - 8/8 ✅ Day 14 - 8/9 ✅ Day 15 - 8/10 ❌(will add another day) Day 16 - 8/11 ✅ Day 17 -  8/12 ✅ Day 18 -  8/13 ✅ Day 19 -  8/14 ✅ Day 20 -  8/15 ❌(will add another day) Day 21 -  8/16 ✅ Day 22 - 8/17 ✅ Day 23 - 8/18 ❌(will add another day) Day 24 - 8/19 ✅ Day 25 - 8/20 ✅ Complete!  My take: Def got stronger over the course of the past 22(+3) days. Though the number of sets I could complete didn't increase drastically, they don't account for my improved control and form over each movement. Since I did this in conjunction w/ the r/bodyweightfitness RR though, I was pretty gassed by the end of the workout and couldn't progress as much. Maybe doing this workout every other day is more effective, especially when compounded with additional forms of exercise. I don't really know what I'm going to do from here—I may keep going with this, or revert back to the RR core triplet. Afaik, this is NOT the end, only the beginning.
Day:1✅                                                                         Day:2✅                                                                               Day:3✅                                                                        Day:4✅                                                                         Day:5
This is a good challenging workout. After 5 days in I am feeling stronger with most of the exercises. The nasty one is the alternating jackknifes, I’ve managed to complete thread the needles which was really satisfying. Thank you. Remember people don’t freak out about completing each phase adapt it or move the key is frequency for your progression.
Alright I just did day 1: I couldn’t complete any of them XD but I will do this everyday
I can't do the alternating jack night it hurts my back can u help
I was doing my own ab workout and I came across this video. Now I’m procrastinating from my workout by reading all these comments. Been like 15 mins time to get back to it😤
Fuck it, Imma do it, and what better than public shunning as punishment in case of failure.    START DATE: 31/7/2020  Day 1: ✓ (Thought I'd do better tbh, but was only able to complete 1 of them to exhaustion).  Day 2: ✓   Day 3: ✓ Day 4: ✓ Day 5: ✓ Day 6: ✓ Day 7: ✓ Day 8: ✓ Day 9: ✓ Day 10: ✓ Fuck both the needle and the X man Day 11: ✓ Livin' on a prayer Day 12: ✓ Day 13: ✓ Day 14: ✓ Day 15: ✓ Day 16: ✓  Day 17: ✓ Day 18: ✓ I'm also adding one for the obliques of the old abs exercise at the end Day 19: ✓ Day 20: ✓ Day 21: ✓ Day 22: ✓✓✓   Still fuck the needles, the xman and the jacknives, but finally I'm done with this.   Now I'm gonna go back to the total workout he posted at the start of lockdown, but doing this instead of the abs there.   I also did this for 7 days, gonna get it down to 6, want a day to rest
Your the best athlete X! Thanks for the know how and science behind it all! My gym is closed ...drop that science my brother ! Love Jesse and your guys sense of humor ...!
So I'm currently on day 10(I  havent skipped a day) and I feel more or less the same I can last a little longer from when I started but I don't see it happening in 22days I'm 5'8, 165lbs btw
I don’t want abs anymore
Will I get abbs if I'm skinny fat
This is an amazing video. Thank you so much and I also wanna know why in these type of videos you guys never wear a shirt. Is it to show the exercise or like what?
Dam that got me imma do it tmmr again thx u man hope it works 💯
Starting this workout today. Gonna update you in 22 days.
Crikey, just came back to review, I started 3 days ago and it's already showing ! Feels great too....

I'm ok for most exercices but way behind on that Alternate Jacknife. Any tips or exercices to build up to the alternate jacknife? Thanks!
I started yesterday, 26th July. Day 1 - ✅ wasn't easy, but I completed it. The stationery bike is hard. Day 2 - ✅ stationery bike didn't get any easier. Neither did any of the rest. Day 3 - ✅ heels to heaven got much easier. I'm getting better at the xman crunch as well. Day 4 - ✅ Day 5 - ✅ I got lazy today. Felt like not doing it. But I pulled myself together and did it. Day 6 - ❌ I missed today... I did go for a long cycle ride in the morning though. Will make up for it Day 7 - ✅ It's been one week! The exercises are definitely getting easier. No outline yet, but I'll keep going! Day 8 - ✅
Linus tech tips strong version

I'm going to start this today and I really hope it works. The goal is to get abs, and to be able to do the 45 second workouts more than you could before.
So once you hit the 22 days should you aim to keep it up everyday or like four times a week?
Day 1 Day 2 Day 3
i started this challenge 11 days ago. and i realized a difference on 8th day. i was already athletic and had low-ish body fat, but i got surprised at how fast the progress came. day 11 and you can see an outline of a six pack, if i flex its pretty much noticeable
1:56 - 45 secs 2:44 - 45 secs 3:20 - 12 reps 3:53 - 10 per side 4:49 - 45 secs 5:35 - 30 secs
smashing pumpkins
I am 17....I am going to do this... Day 1✅
Been doing weighted crunches daily for like a month now. I don't see much happening so I'm gonna try this :) ty
Ah
I swear is it even possible to do that second one
I'm on day 7 of this and already noticing a difference. Have some definition at the top and sides. It is hard and my abs hurt, not terribly but slightly and if I sneeze I know I've been working my abs. Been regularly working out for the past 4 months doing 3 days of weight training and 3 of cardio usually running and been trying to find a good ab workout that feels like it's working and this definitely feels like it's working.
Rest time before moving to the next workout? Is that 10 minutes too??
Day 1 ✅ Day 2✅l Day 3 ✅ Day4❌  Day5✅
Doesn't this exercise need rest for some days for the abs to get muscles...????
Who else thought this was gonna be as easy as Jeff made it look 😰
its good
Day one done. Finished up to alt. Thread the needle. Finished last one as well.
Just completed the 22 day's, first day lasted 8mins 30 secs, today the last day 1hr 35mins 20 seconds.  Not a six pack a good  solid stomach.......thanks Jeff
I have been doing this challenge for almost 22 days. I am impressed with the top of my abs :) mid section still struggling a bit. I workout everyday, clean eating and cardio. I'm excited to keep doing this for another 22 days and see what other results I get.
Basically I’m trying to get to 140 pounds so I can use it to build muscle (I’m 14) but the real qusetion is if I combine them exercise with my diet will I still get ab
You know what I’ll repeat it 10 iMessage today

Hi JF , should i do it everyday?
Is it sequential or can i do which is tougher first and easier last ?
is it okay to do this workout twice a day for 22 days straight?
Superb!!! Really works the living shit out of you, nomatter if you are fit or not! Results show fast!
is it normal that I am not getting that sore? Im getting the work outs done but I'm not sore at all. maybe im burning fat
I think this is only for people with lower belly fat.
am here 2020 in Somalia,am I too late ?  I will be back after 22 days insha'allah
Who accepts this challenge
I have a workout app with exercises similar to this and I have decent abs from the workout app so Jeff's exercises will work
👾👾
Super
Who is watching this during quarantine ... lol
Day 22 and my core r much stronger and i m getting shape of 6 packs thanks man for ur guidelines 😎
Hey there, I would like to make a humble suggestion which is that most of your exercises are too advance for an average person to do and of course it is dead easy for you with your rather uniquely amazing physic. I think in order to put yourself in "our" shoes, it is best to an average person to perform them and that way you can see if it s really doable and how best that can be performed based on our abilities and not your own. Again, I'm a huge fan and love your videos I just wanted to give you a feedback . that's all (from UK)
I like this guy because he always says the truth just exercise won't do. It
Thank you Jeff
Who doing this over quartertine
Wish me luck guys, I'll give a feedback at the end of the 22 days Day 1 ✅ Day 2 ✅ I am kinda exhausted, I don't know if I'll be able to make a full training tomorrow but I'll try Day 3 ✅ Even if I was exhausted, I did it. Now, I feel twice as tired than I was after day 2. My whole abs section, from the front to the sides hurt so bad, but that means the training reached its goal. See ya after day 4 Day 4 ✅ I already feel I can do more reps for each exercise; I'll take a break tomorrow Day 5 ✅ Break Day 6 ✅ Day 7 ✅ Day 8 ✅
Day 1: I barely made it. I feel like I might be doing the exercises wrong. Need motivation. Day 2: don't know if I'm doing it right but I'm sticking to this. I will make it through this. Will update progress.
Damn alternating thread needle is hard
I have no idea how to do the x man

Day 4: ✅( So today was kind of off for me, but I was able to finally almost complete the X-Crunch).                             Day 5: ✅felt out there but my abs area feel tight.                                                         Day 6: ✅ certain exercise I can do more of without stopping, and I still my feel abs tighter but can’t see nun

Hi Jeff, I have started doing this since last 15 days. My abs are getting slightly harder now. But I am experiencing some soreness after the exercise. Would you advise some cool down technique after this work out?
I need help. I’ve literally just finished the first day. I’m not really feeling an ache in my abs when I’m doing the workouts, but I do notice now that it’s completed that I cant tense my abs as tough as I could prior to the workout I’m assuming because of fatigue. Some of the workouts at the end I couldn’t even make it halfway through jackknifes etc. but I still didn’t feel normal aching like you do from working out. Am I doing this wrong or am I going to feel the lactic acid later? Because my abs are fatigued right now
I am a beginner, and I will start today....will send you results at the end of 25 days from now 🙏🙏🙏🙏

Does this work to get abs?
I have a feeling I am doing something wrong I did the first exercise 10 times the second 3 the third 2 and all the others were extinction
I did this for 33 days and I haven't got abs just a flat stomach
I love Jeff's workouts, but I'm not sold on this one. First three exercises from heavy edition look like lower back pain waiting to happen, too much rapid picking heavy stuff from the floor (imo).
106 kg, 191 at 16.Gonna try this without stopping.I am gonna reply to this comment every day so you can see the consistency.I’m gonna do it ecery day with rest in 1/3 days.Following this exercise with good diet and a 34 min jump rope session.Yesterday was day 1.                                                                                     Day 1: I couldn’t do it completely,but i did some other exercises as compensation.
Day 1-✅ Kinda hard but im doin it.
4 days done.. 18 days left let's see
Honest review I  was at low fat  percentage  I practiced it for 22 days without Skipping any day .. my experience is that my core strength increased a lot .. able to reach new level to my discipline towards fitness ... Got into a little shape but no major difference in visibility of abs .. but i would definitely recommend others to practice this as it can bring  alot of changes to you physically and mentally ... In order to get abs you need to burn full body fat percentage ... I am writing down my detailed experience of each and everyday must check out    Day1- 🤘 ( could not get the correct posture)  Day2- 🤘 (can do 2 rounds of all exercises ) Day3- 🤘 ( better posture except last 2                     exercises)  Day4-🤘 ( cramp and pain while performing) Day5-🤘  ( 3 rounds ,less pain better posture)  Day 6-🤘 ( core strength increased)  Day 7-🤘  ( difficulty in last 2 exercises)   Day 8 - 🤘( 3rd round of jackknifes difficult) Day9- 🤘 ( better posture) Day 10- 🤘 ( increased strength ) Day 11🤘( increased rounds to 4 )   Day 12- 🤘( 4 rounds bit hard)    Day 13🤘( improved posture ) Day 14-🤘( decreased rest time )  Day15- 🤘( increased strength) Day16- 🤘(really tired today) Day- 17 -🤘( increased strength) Day18- 🤘 ( exercises became easier)  Day-19 🤘( core tight)  Day20-🤘( tired) Day21-🤘(strength increased) Day22- 🤘( core strength increased alot)
Can you please make a beginner exercise video wjere you just do the exercise please?
60 days lockdown... wasted
It worked in 11 days
By the time I get to the jacknives I cant even get my upper body to come high enough to do the exercise properly. Same with the last exercise. Just on the 2nd day of doing this. Am i doing something wrong or am i just a weakling rn? Any help appreciated, thanks!
beach day coming up, gotta bring out the abs 💯
I don't know why but your fkn sexy. Would like get you like a master ;)
Whenever I stand up I can’t see or feel my abs but when I lay down I can feel them and see them more
Why should I need to get perfect? Be strenther an loose belly is enough for me.
Is this bad for back!
Can someone help me out with this, some exercise in this get me after 3 or so rounds, but others I can do forever, one time I spent an hour doing one of them, but I thought we were supposed to keep ab workouts short
I saw other people doing this so I thought I would also do it for motivation!  Day 1: ✅ Day 2: ✅ Day 3: ✅ Day 4: ✅  Day 5: ✅ Day 6: I didn’t do day 6🙁 Day 7: ✅  Day 8: ✅
0:48 who is this skeleton and where is Jessy ? 0_0
Has anyone found the last exercise super easy compared to the rest? Im half way through the challenge and usually reach extinction in the 4th or 5th set with the other exercises but with stationary bikes i can go over 15 sets. Am i doing something wrong?

Does anyone else’s ears ring after standing right after doing the workout
I feel it when I’m doing the workout but how come I’m not sore after
I'm gonna try this for 22 days starting tomorrow, 9th of June 2020. Will take pictures of my progress, lemme know if u guys want an update
Aight boys I’m starting tomorrow. Ima update on progress. Idk about the motivation factor but I have to try at least.  Also I’m going to be doing cardio and HIIT workouts such as jump roping, burpees, etc to lose fat as well so it’s not just these exercises I’m doing. I’m also going to take one or two rest days every week, 3 workouts in a row, one rest day, 2-3 workouts, one rest day, then the cycle continues. I think that’s to give body time to heal from breaking down muscle fibers which is where the muscle actually grows during the recovery process. Wish me luck. Also can anyone else tell me how many times a day you do this? Because I feel like once a day isn’t enough I’m just not sure.  Day 1: Done. Some exercises got tough but it’s till extinction so I moved on. Idk if I should do this multiple times a day or once a day tho.  Day 2: I’m doing this multiple times a day, I can start to really feel it in my core.  Day 3: Done. I’m doing it 3 times a day. Also doing intermittent fasting to reduce fat
Started this workout yesterday and sweating a lot although not feeling the pain yet and when i keep on doing the extinctions i keep repeating waiting to get unable to do anymore but i just was sweaty and physically tired i didn’t feel pain in my abs, does this mean i’m doing it wrong?? Day 1:✅ Day 2: ✅ Day 3: ✅ Day 4: ✅ Day 5: ✅
Awesome
I’ve lost 35 pounds in the last 3 months I’m 19 6’0 male. Just diet no work out since gyms have been closed an tbh I’m lazy but eating healthy helped me out. I have like 12 days to improve my abs can’t wait to follow this lol
Iam a 22 year old male and I weigh around 60 kg and im 6' tall.I've been doing pushups and crunches before i saw this video...so i didnt feel muscle pain after the second day that was supposed to be there Day 1  Heels to heavens 2 and half Step through planks 2 and half X man crunch 1 rep Altenate thread the needle 1 rep Jacknife × Stationary bike × Day 2 2 rnds 2 +20 secs 1 rep + 6 +6 1 rep 35 sec +10 sec 1 rep 1 .5 reps Day 3 2 + 25 sec 2 + 35 sec 2 reps 2 reps 1rep + 10 sec 2 reps Crunches 25 Day 4 2+30 sec 3 reps 3 reps 3 reps 1rep 15 sec 3 reps ( i may not be doing this correctly🙄) 50 crunches (30+ 20) Day 5 3 reps 10 sec 3 reps 3 reps + 6  3 reps 35 sec 3 reps 75 Day 6 Was bzy with some gardening Day 6 3 reps 30 secs 3 reps 25 secs 4 reps 3 reps 1 rep 5 reps 100 crunches Day 7 4 reps 3 reps Jacknife 1 rep, 25 +20  Xman 4 reps Alt thread the needle 3 reps 4 reps Was feeling a bit lazy ,so passed out on the crunches. Started having doubts on why i am doing all this....i think psychological barrier is more difficult than the physical constraints
After finishing 22 days I noticed that you can see results after about 12 days and the workouts get progressively easier, I had to take a day off in the beginning as I was too sore to continue but as the days go on you don’t get sore anymore and it is much easier to push through to the end and keep up the exercises beyond the 22 days
can i still do as a girl ? or will it make my waist wide?
I cannot do the x man crunch no matter what I do pls help
I tried the routine and did get six pack in approximately in 22 days. Thank you Jeff. Now, looking for new routine have been doing this for two months now. Could you make a new abs video for the graduates of this video?
Day 1✅  Day2
First exercise reason that u will feel lower back pain.❣️
Wait what's a rep goal
day 1:✅(some of the exercise were a little hard to do but got it done
This is for me😳 (4 abs clearly show but are undefined) Start: June/3rd/2020 Day 1: ✅ Day 2: ✅ Day 3: ✅ Day 4: ✅ Day 5: ✅ Day 6: ✅ Day 7: ✅ (one week!) Day 8: ✅  Day 9: ✅ ( can now do at least two rounds of each) Day 10! ✅ (I can get up with no hands!)
I have a bulky body I’m a little chubby can I still get abs
So let's say you complete the first level of work out (Heels to Heavens), when moving onto the second level  (Step Through Planks) is it still a 10 second rest?
Thanks for all your videos!! It works, best thing is can do all at home, great work !!
Start date: 6/3/20
İ cant do jack knives 🙄
These moves does not hurt my back. Thank you
Wait do it for once a day for 22 days or twice?
This is so hard for me but I’m pushing myself through it
this is  dumb because the  high reps are just building endurance  instead of muscle mass
Day 1✅
Watch the video instead of reading the comments...
Starting tomorrow morning, will update my progress!
Do u need to have a diet
1 👍 wish me luck i need soport
Just started, going to try and be really consistent  Day 1:✅ (difficult, but not impossible) Day 2:✅ (I still struggled a little bit, but better than yesterday!) Day 3:✅ (decide to do it twice today, definitely getting better) Day 4:✅ (twice again today) Day 5:✅ (I can do most exercise to or almost to completion. Still struggling on jackknives and step through planks) also decided to continue to go 2x a day for the full 22 Day 6: ✅ Day 7: ✅ Day 8: ✅ (I’m seeing some small results!) Day 9: ✅ Day 10: ✅ Day 11: ✅ (halfway) Day 12: ✅ Day 13: ✅ Day 14: ✅ Day 15; ✅ Day 16: ✅ Day 17: ✅ ( I think I’m going to go back to once a day, now that I’ve improved a lot it’s taking more time) Day 18: ✅ Day 19: ✅ (today wasn’t great, but it’s on days like these you have to keep pushing forward!) Day 20:✅ Day 21:✅ (done 🎉) Ok so I have finished the challenge, I went 22 days straight. While obviously I don’t have a ripped 6 pack I have seen great results. I am very toned and on the road to getting a six pack. Most important part of this challenge is discipline and if you really want to see amazing results you have to eat well. Good luck to anyone else doing this, you’ve got it!

For how long should I rest between each type of exercises when I reached the extinction level?
I cannot do the alternating jackknifes, that’s the hardest one I’m struggling!
every like I do a Jeff Cavaliere face pull
I will start this today and update you guys every day so I can test this challenge.  For starters: I'm 6'3, 215 lbs, decently fit, midsection fat, if I had to assume, I'd say 20% Body Fat.  WISH ME LUCK!  Day 1: ✅Wow. The first day is the hardest. Much harder than I thought, but, consistency is key to this workout. I've finally cut all the fast foods and sweets out of my diet and I'm focusing on eating lean. One day down, 21 more to go BABY !! See y'all tomorrow.

Go to 5:29 and pause and  then go back 10 second you’ll see 3 jeffcavilereathleanx.coms
I tried the first exercise and I was on 20 minutes and just thought this is too easy I can’t spend this much time every day it would probably take me 1.5 hours to tire
Can you still eat a desent diet and still get abbs or will it take longer
Can you be fat when you start this
I think I’m doing the last exercise wrong can someone help? I’m not feeling any burn in my abs but it’s still difficult to do.
On average, about how long does this ab routine take to complete? Trying to figure out if I have time to fit it into my current workout routine every day..
Even that skeleton in the back hits the gym
Thank for workout

Starting today, may25th. Going to be cutting my calories by 700ish so i can lose body fat and gain muscle at the same time. Day1: complete ✅
Day 1: couldn’t finish the whole thing
Starting this tomorrow so uhh wish me luck lol Day 1:
Well to be perfectly honest, in my humble  opinion, of course without offending anyone who thinks differently from my point of view, but also by looking into this matter in a different perspective and without being condemning of one’s views and by trying make it objectified , and by considering each and every one’s valid opinion, I honestly believe that I completely forgot what I was going to say.
I saw a lot of people doing this so I'm gonna try it. Started a few days earlier but I'm gonna keep track now.  Start date: 5/22/2020 Day 1: ✅ Day 2: ✅ Day 3: ✅ Day 4: ✅ (4/6 - had to stop early) Day 5: ❎ Day 6: ❎ Day 7: ✅ Day 8: ❎ (not good 😬) Day 9: ✅

Starting the challenge today 😬💪 please help me stay motivated Day 1✅
Im gonna try it bc why not  Day 1:done Day 2: Day 3: Day 4: Day 5:
Starting Date: 5/22/2020 Day 1:
I just did day 4 of this challenge and I have to admit that for the first 4 exercises I manage to do pretty much 2 rounds for each, but when I get to the last two exercises I manage only like 15 secs each. Should I do less rounds for the first exercises so that I hypothetically/hopefully do more seconds on the last two exercises or should I just give time to my abs to get stronger and then build more time on them? What do you guys think? :)
Should I have rest days?
I’m scared to do this after leg day..
Hi
Would it be good if u did it multiple times a day
Anyone die mid rep, and then scroll through the comments to see if anyone else did?
Cause if it doesn't then the last 22 days has been a waste of my time
Does this even get u a six pack
Is their any alternate exercise to alternating thread the needle for the obliques?
He talked about this like it was hard
Started 18 may 2020 Day 1 :✅ Day2: ✅ Day3: ✅ Day 4: ✅ getting easier Day 5: ✅ Day 6: skipped Day 7: ✅ last day of Ramadan Day 8: ✅ Eid 2020 Day 9: ✅ Day 10 :✅ don't feel any visible differences yet Day 11: ✅ getting easier so doing slow reps now Day 12:✅ Day 13:✅ Day 14:✅ Day 15:✅ Day 16:✅

I'm a string bean girl ...what am I doing here ....I'm gonna do this. I'm insane.
I was so close to finishing but stopped. Please help me redeem. I then broke my arm during the second try so here we go again. Start date 3: 8/25/20 Day 1:✅
Fuck it maybe commenting will help me stick to it. Here we go.  Day 1:✅
It seems like I have to do the 45 second 7 times before I give up and I am doing the form perfectly and slow and at a good pace.
Anyone else starting workout at coronatime✌
Day 1: 💪🏾
I tried this for 22 days and can see visible results. I had a normal body weight but a bigger tummy. After 22 days my belly had significantly reduced and I can see my upper abs well defined.  On day 1 it took me 36 minutes, on day 22 I was able to do 62 minutes.  Going to try another cycle of 22 days with tougher workouts.
I worked my way through it every day! At first I felt like giving up halfway. But after a day or 5 it becomes easier already. Push yourself, don't give up! If it becomes to easy / you don't get sore, repeat the exercise until you fail the set, and then continue to the next one.
2:55 Anybody else can’t do this one?
Nais
Hello my name is young stomach, and this is the abs challenge, about to start day one hahahhaa
So i switched it up after like day 9 because this wasn’t making me sore anymore. should i be sore after every time i do this?
I can't believe that I at last found a site that works. Got so many free gems from Haxbrawl . Find it on google ;)
Ray is definitely looking weak-in-the-knees, I'd say he's hit the "extinction" level!! That's one way to bypass that whole complex "daily-diet logistic" effort!  Ray has now officially "completed" the (fitness) Work-Out Theory to it's natural conclusion.... He's "cut" to-the-bone bro!
I have always thought that dieting is eating only green vegetables and drinking water. NextLevelDeit proved me wrong. I am eating delicious and nutritionally rich food and still reaching my fitness goals.
starting date: 18/5/20 day 1: ✅ i tried as hard as i could even tho it wasn’t amazing day 2: ✅ sore but still did the best i could day 3: ✅ body super sore but it felt easier day 4: ✅ already feels a lot easier day 5: ✅ started adding oblique exercises as well day 6: ✅ day 7: ✅ day 8: ✅
The amount of people who have said they will update after completion and never came back 😂 I'm not promising anything but here goes day 1!
Day 1
Did this work in 22 days ? Ima start today
For future reference: Video starts at 1:49 Heels to the heaven: 45 sec 10 sec rest, then repeat if completed  Step through plank: 45 sec  X man crunch: 12 reps  Alternating threading needle: 10 reps each side  Alternating jack knives: 45 secs  Stationary bike: 30 secs  Count: Day 1✔ Day 2✔ Day 3✔ Day 4✔ Day 5✔ Day 6✔ Day 7✔ Day 8✔ Day 9✔ Day 10✔ Day 11✔ MIDWAY!

Overall, this is a good intro ab workouts
Started 3days ago 1st day- after completing 4/6th exercise,completely drained out!!still finished 5th and 6th with somewhat proper form and they were too tough 2nd day- abs became really sore more than when i did 100 crunches at a time or 1month planks,today exercise wise the same as the first day lol 3rd day- today i completed the whole workout as mentioned..felt great really! ...will update everyday from now
I am 17 Male. Starting Date: May 17, 2020 Day 01: ✅ Day 02: ✅ Day 03: ✅ Day 04:✅
Remember why you’re doing this!! Your motivation is for all the hot babes at the beach this summer!😤😎😏only the most cut get the hottest girls. You don’t want the uglies do you??
Jeff has so many different ab workout videos that I don’t know which one I should do
Ok I'm gonna try this. Help me along.  Start date: 16th May 2020 Day 1: Was able to do 2 sets at least of every exercise except the Jack Knives. Couldn't get the hang of it. Maybe tomorrow. Also, added two sets of Russian twists to the workout (I feel those the most). Day 2: Was a lil bit sore from yesterday so could only do sets as 3,1,1,1.5 xD,1,5, and one set of Russian twists. Still I don't think I am able to do Jack Knives correctly. My back hurts in that , guess I need some support for that. Day 3: Nothing new. Day 4: ✔️ Day 5: ✔️ Day 6: ✔️ Day 7: ✔️ Day 8:✅ (was exhausted already today so couldn't do it like regular)
I have been doing it since 1 month but only 30% result
Do you do these once a day? I wanna push myself to the limit, so would twice in the day be beneficial?
I started this challenge 2 years ago and I got abs almost immediately after 22 days of doing this. Still have abs today, thanks Jeff!
Do you have to do the whole thing 1 or more times a day?
This all exercise is for lower abs what about upper abs ??
dont mind me im just keeping track day one(check)
Who is here in quarantine?
I am Angel Rafael Muñoz i well do it 22day
My abs are beginning to show but they’re more visible in good lighting.  (I had to rewrite this comment because when I went to update tonight I hit delete by accident 😡)  Starting Date: May 5, 2020 Day 1: ✅ My abs are killing me (in a good way) Day 2: ✅ Day 3: ✅ Day 4: ✅  Day 5: ✅ (Getting more visible with less light) Day 6: ✅ Day 7: ✅ Day 8: ✅ Day 9: ✅ Day 10: ✅ Day 11: ✅ (50% done and more definition!) (Took a break for a few days to study for finals but now I’m back on the grind) Day 12: ✅ Day 13: ✅ Day 14:
Are you guys doin any specific diet while doing this? I’ve done this for 2 days now and I’m wondering if should go on a diet to help or if I could stick to eating how I normally do and have similar or better results
Whaooo thanks men really yours exercises help me very much thaks god bless you from México
does this actually work is what i gotta know
Don’t lie,     Everyone looked in the mirror to see if the got abs the first time they did this
Start 13 may: Day 1: 👍🏻
Since everyone else is doing it, I'll chime in.  START DATE 05/11/20   Day 1: This is a truly brutal, humbling workout. The alternating jack knives especially had me questioning my existence. Did 3 before form went to shit. Hopefully as my core improves I'll be able to do more. Day 2: Same as day 1. Still difficult, still wanna die while doing the jack knives.  Day 3: No real change from day 2. Still hate jack knives and stationary bike was particularly difficult today. Had problems keeping my core tight enough to make sure my shoulders remained off the ground. Gonna be a long 22 days boys lol.  Day 4: Day 5: Day 6: Day 7: Day 8: Day 9:  Day 10: Day 11: Day 12: Day 13: Day 14: Day 15: Day 16: Day 18: Day 19: Day 20: Day 21: Day 22:

What diet or what should you eat while doing this
Starting date 11/05/2020 #quarantine Day 1 : 🤘 Day 2: 👍 Day 3: 👍 ( not able to do last one properly) (today I did two and a half rounds of heels to heaven) Day 4: 🤘 ( today started from stationary bicycle because in the end could not do it properly) ( started to do 2 rounds of each exercise) Day 5: 👍 ( jackknives are still a problem )
There is no way you can do this in 22 days unless you are already very fit. Doing this from a standing start, you will just hurt yourself and quit. He is between 10 to 15 percent body fat in the video. Most humps watching this video are probably 25 to 30%. This is a 3 month plan and that is with a serious switch to a healthy reduced diet and working out 6 days a week.
Can we start from fat figure
I got a 4 pack in 6 days into this challenge I’m completely shocked it’s changed my life literally!!!!
Day 1: ✅ Day 2: ✅
Today is the first day I am trying these exercises. Mainly its because of years of fooling myself into the dilusional Cartman theory of not being fat but being big boned has not been working lately. I am 6"1' and was around 230 less then a year ago which was managable but since have gained about 30 pounds and my shirts and pants no longer fit and are begging me to lose weight as they have reached their limits. I will chart my progress and see how it goes,along with trying to change my diet. I already tried switching to light beer but this was unsuccesful as it sucks so very very much so I will have to try harder to offset this. My goal is to be around 220 lbs in a few months,I am not trying to looked ripped I just want to be healthier and not be out of breathe from putting on my socks. I feel like this is an obtainable goal and not much to ask for from myself but I have asked for less and received nothing at all from me before so we shall see...
Have undertaken the challenge and will keep an update to hopefully encourage some of you!   Day 1 completed 🥑 Sets achieved - 7,1,0,4,0,4 - maybe my technique was off on some.  Nevertheless I feel worked-out. Day 2 completed 🥝  3,2,0,3,0,3 abs have been sore since I woke up. Routine was harder to do. Day 3 completed 🥦 2,2,1,2,1,2 abs not as sore as yesterday but energy was low from labour work.  I had a faint 4 pack without tensing before this challenge, yet already my middle abs have become slightly more refined without tensing.  Day 4 completed 🥥 8,2,1,3,1,3 first day abs felt properly recovered. Was it a high energy day, or getting stronger? Day 5 completed 🍍 2,2,1,1,1,2 low energy workout with little motivation. Hopefully tomorrow proves more beneficial  Day 6 completed 🍑 8,2,1,2,0,2 abs feel generally tighter and more defined. Time to stretch  Day 7 first week completed 🥬 3,1,1,0,0,2 Motivation at all time low today, I don't think it can be worse than this over the next 2 weeks  Day 8 completed 🍇 11,4,1,3,1,2 every time I look in the mirror, this challenge becomes more and more worth it!  Day 9 completed 🌽 12,4,1,4,1,4 turns out I've been doing exercises 3 and 5 for longer than the plan at 45s each set.  All adds to the results, so il keep going with that!  Day 10 completed 🍉 13,5,1,5,1,4  abs burn during last sets of each exercises, but no pain after - any one know if I should be feeling sore the next day?  Day 11 completed 🍎 14,6,1,6,1,5 Half way house. Abs look overall more defined.  I have a small but bumpy 4 pack when I tense. Bottom 2 deeper abs are beginning to make an appearance  Day 12 completed 🥒 15,7,1,1,6 this challenge is worth it Day 13 completed 🍊 6,3,2,1,1,2 only just... Day 14 completed 🍐 8,4,1,1,1,2 the word 'motivation' ' should never be understated   Day 15 completed 🍅  10,4,1,0,0,2 motivation low as hell still Day 16 completed  🍌 5,5,1,3,1,4 motivation low, but got to commit  Day 17 completed 🥭 6,3,1,1,3 Day 18 completed 🎂 5,4,1,1,1,3 Day 19 completed 🍈 7,4,1,1,1,3  Day 20,21 and 22 completed 🌹 Although I forgot to note the reps  Overal abs look more defined. It's worth giving this your absolute all. I did on certian days and that is where the results where at, the mediocre reps only seemed to maintain what abs I had.   SAS and Marines will train hard and they gain the results. When one is tired and one's mind first says 'enough' ' , it's a self indicator that 40% of possible workout has been achieved.   Get your body fit and your mind with it, you can achieve great things    Give those plants a try too 😜
Here we go! Day 1 ✅ Day 2 ✅ Day 3 ✅
Is the needle thread even a good core workout? It just makes my arms sore
What if I take extinction of 30 sec or 20 sec?
Iam juste gonna tell you this THANK YOU!!!!!!😉😉😉😉

Does anyone neck kinda like feel sore when doing these like it doesn't hurt but it's just a disturbance
The thread the needle exercise didn't really make my abs sore, but made my arms sore. What am I doing wrong?
What is diet to follow in pre & post workout and what should we eat
Date-6/5/2020 today is 22nd day I got six packs by doing these exercises twice a day but not like jeff
i’m in decent shape, but is it bad if i’m extinct after the first exercise and have to move on?
Sir did you use protein powder to make your body
I've started Jeff's other 22 day challenge, unfortunately I don't feel like the excercises there are working so well, probably due to my poor form. I'm on day 4 of that plan and will carry on to day 5 on this plan tomorrow. Just gonna post progress here to keep me motivated 😅  Day 1: ✔️ Day 2:✔️ Day 3:✔️ Day 4:✔️ Day 5: Day 6: Day 7: Day 8: Day 9: Day 10: Day 11: Day 12: Day 13: Day 14: Day 15: Day 16: Day 17: Day 18: Day 19: Day 20: Day 21: Day 22:
I will try this from tomorrow and let you guys know the results in 22 days. There is another video 22 days ab workout of jeff where he incorporates slightly different workouts like the W etc. I wonder why its different.
I wanna do this so that I can have stronger abs by the end of may... but I had scoliosis surgery in december and now I can't bend my back to go up into most of these exercises ;-;
I’ve been trying everything but it seems that only my neck and legs burn, while my stomach is fine. Am I doing something wrong? Also, whenever I squeeze my stomach, I can’t breath.
And with that I mark complete my 22 days.   Starting weight: 230 Ending weight: 215 Abs before: hehe squishy belly  Abs after: hehe not squishy belly  Plus I got that outline coming back  I'd really recommend doing some cardio alongside this too. I honestly just started walking for a couple miles. Weight starts shedding quick.
Started training 3/5/20 Day 1 : ☑️ Edit: fucked up, starting again. 23 April 2021 Day 1: ✔️ Day2: ✔️ Day3: ✔️ Day4: ✔️ Day5:✔️ Day6:✔️ Day7:✔️ Day8:✔️ Day9:✔️ Day10:✔️ Day11:✔️ Day12:✔️ Day13:✔️ Day14:✔️ Day15:✔️ Day 16: ✔️ Day 17:✔️ Day18:✔️ Day19:✔️ Took a 2 days break.

Starting 5/1/20 Day 1: Had trouble doing jackknifes, barely got to 11 with X crunch
What is the perfect time to do this workout?       Before meal or after the meal.
So doing this work out is great but I feel like as someone who has been out of the game a while I’m hella sore and my abs seem very fatigued. I feel like my work out has suffered for 2 days because of it. I know this is 22 days straight I’m just not sure if it’s becoming worth it at this point other then building the habit and sticking to it.
WTF🤯🤯🤯 it worked that's sick
Today is May 1,2020. Take this comment as a promise to myself and everyone that sees this that I will stick with this routine for the next 22 days! I got faith that I can do anything through Christ who strengthens me, and I will do my best to turn these flabs into abs💪🏼  5/1:✅ Worked out a bit of a sweat, I got to 2 levels of the first exercise and 5 reps for the stationary bike exercise but for the other exercises I only reached level 1 of extinction. I also found myself taking a longer break than 10 sec. 😅 Anyways I’m pretty sure I wasn’t doing ANY of these with perfect form but hopefully by the end of this I’ll get that form down.  5/2: ✅ About the same as the day before, wasn’t expecting any improvement that quick anyways.  5/3:😕 Alright so 3 days into it I felt like something’s wrong. My abs feel real sore from the other two days and I did a bit of research that said you should let your body heal and repair itself before working out the same area again. So...from this point on I’ve decided to spread out the 22 days a bit, I will still stick with the routine but I’ll take a break every other day to stretch out the abdominal section and get some push-ups and dumbbell workout in.  5/4: ✅ Back to the ab workouts, the day break to let my abs chill and recover for a bit was well needed.  5/5: 🏋🏻 Worked our the upper body today (I will do ab workouts in a gradual fashion just on Monday’s, Wednesday’s, and Friday’s)  5/6: ✅ I feel like I’m getting better with each day that passes. I got to do a few more extinction levels for each exercise, noticeably got better at the X-man exercise.  5/7:🏀 Played some basketball today, put up some shots and worked out my vertical. Tomorrow will be a week since I’ve tried this and I think I can actually stick with this “every other day” ab workout thing!  5/8: ✅ My big bro joined in today and it actually pushed me to do more extinction levels and got me up to 3 levels for a few of them.  5/9 & 5/10: Weekend break, just did a couple pushups.  5/11 - 5/15: ✅ Stuck with the routine from last week, played basketball again on Thursday and the ab workouts seem to be getting easier. Maybe next month I could start doing it daily.  5/18: ❌ Nah. I’m ditching this routine. I am keeping that first workout in my new one though, that actually hurts like hell and is a good ab workout for me, but the rest left me feeling tired and sore in my shoulders and neck...but not my abs. 3 weeks and no results. From now on, here’s my ab workout:  Heels to the heavens (45 sec) - 3x *1-2 min break Heels to the heavens - 3x *1-2 min break Heels to the heavens - 3x *3-5 min break (halfway) 2 min plank *1 min break 2 min plank *1 min break 2 min plank *1 min break  ^after doing that on the first day of not doing the other routine I felt like it was a much better workout for my abs🤷🏻‍♂️ I’ll check back in about a month👋🏼
i think i can't do properly the x man crunch, alternating jackknives and stationary bikes But  Day 1 - ✔  I don't really think that i did it properly, do you think, that it will also affect me?   Day 2 - ✔ Day 3 - ✔
Day 1 ✅ Day 2✅ Day 3✅ Day 4✅ Day 5✅
I am 17 so can i do this?
starting on april 30th 2020. Day 1:✅(the first 3 took me a couple reps before extinction but had lots of trouble on the last few)
I feel like i am doing all of the exercises wrong. My back always goes straight when i try to crunch. can't seem to bend my back for some reason
I'm 16 just and i just started the exercise today So I'll be checking in everyday  Day 1:✅ Day 2:✅ Day 3:✅ Day 4:✅ Day 5:✅
When is it the best time to workout? In the morning or in the evening?
Starting Date 4/29/20 Day 1: ✅ Day 2: ✅ (almost didn’t do it) Day 3: ✅ Day 4: ✅ Day 5: ✅ Day 6: ✅ Day 7: ✅ (One Week!) Day 8: ✅ Day 9: ❌ had a rough day and couldn’t get it in :(. just means we’ll have to go to 23 😄 Day 10: ✅ Day 11: ✅ Day 12: ✅ Day 13: ✅ Day 14: ✅ Day 15: ✅ (feeling and seeing some slight progress) Day 16: ✅ Day 17: ✅ Day 18: ✅ Day 19: ✅ Day 20: ✅ Day 21: ❌ very drunk, will not be exercising tonight. Day 22: ✅ (because of the two skipped days were going to 24 ofc) Day 23: ✅
What am I doing for the next 22 days stuck in my house doing absolutely fuck all
Ima do this for 2 months ..... brb y’all
Well this is a reality check haha! I figure ok cool let’s goo!! First 3 exercises rolled thru got a few sets by the last few lol I was dead. Day 2 down excited to see what I can put out in 20 more days of this! Thanks Jeff!
Question to all of you guys (who do the workout) - how long does a single day workout take you on average, until you reach extinction on all exercises?
day 2 i almost threw up i’m deas
I’m going to record my self doing this if you guys wanna watch for motivation
Ima record my self doing this if you guys would please watch my progression
do i do this before my cardio or after my cardio?
Jeff. Did you also do running to get those abs? Please can anyone tell me.
Lmfao I can’t even do 2 😂of most of them 💀but I’m so motivated to keep going ❗️❗️
Why dose my back crack every time I do a sit-up or back movements like that
If you need an easy timer set-up, search on youtube something like  "45 secs interval with 10 secs rest" (or the time stamps you need), and you'll get tons of options to chose. Hope this is helpful.
I have allergies on many foods and It is hard for me to find a diet that doesn't include particular foods. Then my friend sent me link to the website called NextLevelDiet where I can get personalized meal plan only with food I select. My fitness journey has just started, what about you?
step through planks are hard af
Starting date: 4/27/20 Day 1: 💯 Please give me some encouraging words, I want to work out my core and get rid of this belly fat I have.
Aren’t you supposed to rest your muscles at least 48hrs? I started yesterday on this challenge and I got questions if someone can help
Is that even good to continually work the abs like that?
Im trying to do this but it's kinda hard for me to copy exactly what he is doing and I feel like im doing it wrong
Day 1: ✅ ( Went well but was a tough workout for someone like myself with little ab exercising experience. Usually reached extinction at 1-2 rounds.) Day 2: ✅
I’m gonna try this.... be back in 22 days!
Starting date: April 11, 2020 (Posted late) Day 1:✅ (Here we go!) Day 2:✅ Day 3:✅ Day 4:✅ Day 5:✅ Day 6:✅  Day 7:✅ (Can you feel it now mr. Krabs?) Day 8:✅ Day 9:✅ Day 10:✅ (My stomach hates me) Day 11:✅ Day 12:✅ Day 13:✅ Day 14:✅ (Abs coming in) Day 15:✅ (Got thrown off but still did it) Day 16:✅ Day 17:✅ Day 18:✅ Day 19:✅ Day 20:✅ Day 21:✅ Day 22:✅ Summary: To be honest I was kinda skeptical after watching this vid but after doing the 22 days I can say that it’s definitely worth a shot if you’re trying to improve you ab muscles. After all 22 days my result was a 4 pack outline and I can just say that if you’re going to try this just be patient, stay determined, and follow the video exactly I can’t stress that enough but most importantly, GET THEM GAINS BOI 💪
Starting Date: 25/04/20  , 85 kg Day 1: Done ✅ Day 2: Done ✅ Day 3: Done ✅ Day 4: Done ✅

Who’s here after the “get a six pack in 22 days” video he just released
Starting tommorow! 23/04
just finished today! did it everyday, and got into a routine. i dont have a full out 6 pack, even though my body fat percent is single digits, but the muscles have grown for sure. they are visibly bigger, and you can see the 6 pack outline
A week ago I finished Jeff's AX-1 program and I highly recommend it. All the exercises are explained in detail and includes the eating plan (NO DIET) in truth we can all prepare those foods without having much money. Here I leave you my physical transformation and in my channel you will find the challenges that I was making of the program. @, by the way this week start with the AX-2 Extreme program. Taking advantage of them I invite you to subscribe to my channel, there I will also be uploading the videos of the challenges of the AX-2 program.

Im doing abs exercise in the morning and body workout in the evening . Is it good ? PLEASE REPLY ME !
Is this workout only for men?
Hey Jeff, the left side of my Abs don’t seem to contract at all and only my right side does.   Whenever I do “any“ kind of ab workout be it planks or leg raises the middle of my abs protrude and I’m thinking do I have a hernea? What is happening?  And there is space growing wider in between the left and right sides of my abs
I am 16 years old And I want to ask that can I do these exercises or not??please tell me
Gonna try and do this for quarantine Day 1: ✔

I did two of these today.  MyFrigginGoodness!!!
Starting date (14/4/2020) Day 1:- ✔️ Day 2:-✔️ Day 3:-✔️ Day4:-✔️ Day5:-✔️
I can do the last one for ever. Am I doing something wrong? (I can't do the jackknife for more than 30 '')
Started April 11, 2020 (Posted April 15)  Day 1: ✅it was really hard done it first time (I have to split the Threading needles into 5 each arm) jackknives was hell Day 2: ✅my body was really sore,  Day 3: ✅more sore than before jackknives is still hard. Day 4: ✅I did the needles as the video says Day 5: ✅when I did the first exercise my abdomen hurts, it’s really getting hard in terms of motivation.😞 Day 6: ✅  Day 7: ✅ jackknives is still difficult I don’t know if my form is right but i did needles real good. Day 8: ✅I might change jackknives to something else. Day 9: ✅form is good, for jackknives I brought my legs closer instead of the original. Day 10: ✅ My mind always thinks I have to do this everyday.  Day 11: ✅ halfway done  Day 12: ✅ did it in the morning instead of the usual afternoon.  Day 13: ✅ almost missed it did it at night but did more reps Day 14: ✅ for some reason, I hate doing the 2nd exercise Day 15: ✅ lasted 45 minutes Day 16: ✅ I woke up 8:30 pm but did it until 9:00 I’m really scared that tomorrow I’ll miss it.  Day 17:  ✅ did it noon. My form on all exercises was really nice except jackknives. I really felt all my abdominal muscles the whole time. Day 18: ✅ best day for me. 7 sets of heels to heaven, x man crunch and stationary bikes. 5 sets of cross step planks, needles, and jackknives. Took an hour. Day 19: ✅ So tired. But it felt good.  Day 20: ✅ same as yesterday 45 minutes. Day 21: ✅  Day 22: ✅ the hardest fr I did 5,3,5,3,3,5 in order of the exercise. Did a 1:11 seconds plank at the end  Note: Started on Day 8 i change the time to 45 seconds. On day 13 I’m doing additional 10 seconds plank after needles. On day 15 I started adding a minute plank to end my exercise.  End Date: May 2, 2020  Final Thoughts: Can’t believe I did it. First 5 days were the hardest in terms of motivation, my body was really sore but as my body got used to it it doesn’t hurt anymore. My suggestion for those who want to do this is buy a gym/yoga mat when doing this, I did all of this on a hard wood floor and man I got bruises on my elbows lol. For the first half I think I did it mostly afternoon before dinner. However, I think it’s the best to do it before lunch or mornings. In addition to the exercise I brisk walk 5 miles atleast 3 days a week. My belly definitely was flatter I have 4 abs 2 were visible the other 2 have lines on it but I have to flex it to be visible. I will definitely keep doing this until before fall classes starts. I’ll give an update here by end of August. I’m really glad I did something productive in this quarantine period. I definitely got stronger and really helped me develop my discipline.
BROOO! I TRIED DOING JACK KNIVES! OH MAH GOD DID I FELT LIKE A FUCKING PENGUIN😂😂😭

Ok day one
I hate fat. I started to have a small (very small actually) belly one year ago. I am so glad it's all gone but at the same time I struggle to have decent abs below my navel (my abs are very streched). Your videos really give me the motivation to get it. Don't start to gain fat, it is so hard to get rid of it afterwards.
I'm a teen, I taking this on as of now I have 30% body fat, but My body is at the very least strong enough to to all this, I starting tomorrow april 14
Doing this while in quarantine! I will update daily: Day 1✔️ So this was my first day. I did the exercises. The first one i did it 2 times the other 1 time. Ex 3 and 4 and 5 are really hard! Barelly did it with not as great form as i thought! Will improve! 💪 Day 2 ✔️ Did everything with a good form except ex 5. Day 3✔️ I'm satisfied with my performance today. Only ex 5 was the exercise I didn't manage to do perfectly! Day 4✔️ I did ex 1 and 2 two times the other ex one time. Also I want to add that I'm doing ex 5 with tucked leggs because I don't have the strenght to keep them straight 😂 Day 5 ✔️ Day 6 ✔️ My best performance so far! + I'm feeling my core a lot more stronger! Day 7 ✔️ Week 1 Done!
This works?
Hello sir please gaid me  ....im suvo from India  age 24 weight 52 ....u wants to weight gain ...I have no gym equipment.. I want to home work out with out equipment .. please sir help me please sir I humble request to you please sir...
How much time do exercise in a day ???
Starting date: 12th april 2020 I recently started working out alot but since the covid breakout, you know we all got quarantined and basically that motivation that i once had, had finished. But i will start working out at home regardless and i suggest for anyone bored or even has a slight bit of interest in fitness, they should definitely start looking into these workouts. Day 1: did the workout early morning, right after i woke up and already i feel invincible 😂. by the way if you have weights, you can use them too.
Day 1: ✓
Wow this works, my stomach is literally on fire
Groso, ídolo
Can I do all this even though I have a bulging disc?
Day 1: this is hard but I’m willing to do it Day 2: my lower abs were sore from yesterday jackknifes killed me but I made it through and then stationary bikes I couldn’t do it the others were easy
Today was my last day of the workout, for me it got harder everyday. I see a difference, I already had my abs kind of showing, but now it’s showing more with extra details on the sides and the lower abs. I’m glad I did this, it helped enhance my abs a lot.
Which is the better workout this or the one he posted 1 week ago?
Day 1:1(20:00min) Day 2:2(34:00min) Day 3:3(35:00min) Day 4:4(35:00min) Day 5:5(20:00min) Day 6:6(37:00min) Day 7:7(37:00min) Day 8:8(38:00min) Day 9:9(38:00min) Day 10:10(34:00min) Day 11:11(35:00min) Day 12:12(36:00min) Day 13:13(36:00min) Day 14:14(37:00min) Day 15:15(36:00min) Day 16:16(37:00min) Day 17:17(37:00min) Day 18:18(38:00min)
So if you keep making the 45 second mark just keep going after 10 seconds until you physically can't doesnt matter if it's 1 round of the same exercise or 5 rounds of the same exercise?
1:✅
Hi, I don't know if this will be a stupid question, but...between exercise, how much I need to rest?
He just Speaks too much.... 😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒
I stopped updating here and decided to write down in my own journal but so far im on my 8th day and the top half of my stomach is already starting to show an outline of my abs when i flex and my lower belly is actually starting to shrink everyday, i still have love handles and some lower belly fat but my waist has definitely shrunk by a lot!!   this shit works, thanks, Jeff!!
Started today, see you at 2 May

lol Spme years back I had been wanting a six pack and I used to watch this guy’s videos but never did the exercises but now I’m actually doing them and it’s my first day right now let’s see after 3 weeks my body shape
Gonna start this alongside my normal exercise and record my progress. Day 1: I had trouble with most of these, but i made it through all of them with at least one extinction, i rarely worked on my abs before this but i can already feel them coming in! Day 2: Had some trouble with the bicycling, but i'll get that sorted out. i actually got two extinctions with the first exercise, so i'd say im making progress! my chest is becoming more defined by the day. Day 3: Its suprising how fast this works, the exercises are becoming easier to do, although my endurance is still pretty low, the effects are coming in fast! Day 4: all good Day 5: good
Day 1✅ Day 2 ✅ Day 3✅ Day 4✅
Did this for two days and I’ve already lost 2 pounds. On day 4 tomorrow! I missed one lol
Hey Jeff! I finally started fasting. I eat meat and green veggies everyday around 6 p.m. I exercise EVERY morning (jog/walk 2 miles, 100 squats, 100 sissy push-up, 100 ten-second attempts to do a pull up, and 100 type of reverse crunches). I’m trying to get a 4pack, and rid myself of at least 65% of my back-thigh cellulite. I’m 43, and 5 yrs ago I started eating sugar🤮. I’ve been cold turkey for about two months now. My next goal is to reduce my dairy intake. I drink a gallon on milk a week.
Starting date April 9th 2020 Day1:✅ Day2:✅ Day3:✅ Day4:✅ Day5:✅ (by far the hardest day got some definition) Day6:✅ Day7:✅ Day8:✅ Day9:✅
I need help, I’m younger and I can’t do a lot of these (I’m physically unable to do them) is there an easier way to do some of these so I can learn and maybe be  able to?
Day 1👍
Pls I would like to see abs work out using resistance bands at home. Because we cant go to the gym right now. Thanks

Guys plz comment. Which videos have made you get abs the best
Do we have to put on a diet  Like any food intake restrictions or anything such?
I started this challenge 2 years ago and I got abs almost immediately after 22 days of doing this. Still have abs today, thanks Jeff!
Workout done: Day 1 done Day 2 done Day 3 done
I feel like my core is strong but I barely have any abs bc I’m doing these exercises and everything except my abs burn and I’m doing so many rounds it’s starting to feel like it’s just getting repetitive. Any suggestions?
I started off at a twelve minute workout and needed on a 22 minute workout. YOU ALL CAN DO THIS
doing this shit starting now (4/7/20)
Will this all just be one set a day? Or like 3 sets of all these a day
Okay I’m going to attempt this challenge I’m a 5’7 Male almost 15 and I weigh somewhere near 125 I’ve been doing exercise at home for over a month now. I’m definitely not fat but I’m not bone skinny either. I have a little bit of beer belly fat but that’s fine I’m looking to get rid of it after this challenge. Give me a bit of motivation please. I’ll start today  Day 1: 😂 Day2😂 Day3😂started doing this vid twice after a 2 min break. I’m not eating a lot so I don’t know if I’m going to see physical results after this vid. I’m going to change my diet tomorrow. Day 4😂 Day5😂 day6😂 Day 7 😂 Day 8 couldn’t do them but I did today and a rest day isn’t too bad i guess Day 9😂 Day 10forgot to them them kinda but I’m still working out. Day11 😂 my core is getting way stronger Day 12  tried different exercises on day 11 and pulled a muscle out for today and tomorrow  Day13 when I flex a can definitely feel my abs and see a little bit on the top
someone clear me how many time time I do this exercise. .in a day??
Trying to get abs in shape, this 22 day challenge has exercises that don’t crane my neck and lower back like your 2018 “6pack challenge”.  Both challenges are great!  Thanks!
Day 1 ✅ Day 2 ✅ Day 3 ✅ Day 4 ✅ Day 5 ✅ Day 6 ✅ Day 7 ✅ (nailed heals to heaven for 2 rounds) Day 8 ✅ Day 9 ✅ Day 10 ✅ Day 11 ✅ (50% done! ) Day 12 ✔️

I'm considering starting this tomorrow... I have little experience with weights, gym and poor strength / core strength. I am 63kg and 5ft6.Is it a bad idea to go straight in to this? What can I expect from 22 days? Appreciate any thoughts
Starting date: 5/4/20   Day 1: Complete Day 2: Complete Day 3: complete Day 4: complete Day 5: complete Day 6: complete (forgot to update but done from day 7 to day 15)
You Are wrong Fortnite is awesome
Thanks bro
Hey man I have only question... I have a lower back pain issue... So is it safe for me to perform it...and second question can I do the second excercise side plank rotation at last?
I've a question can we do abs exercise twice per day??
For females wanting to know how this workout is here it goes... Disclaimer I'm a track runner we do core a lot but since corona I’m been out of school and haven’t done core as usual. Day 1;✅the 1st exercise I made it all the way to the 3rd round, but for most of the exercises I made it to the 2nd round expect the last one. It really wasn't that bad.  Day 2;✅I was sore from yesterday and found out I skipped 2 exercises yesterday and they packed a punch today, but I really struggled with a lot of the exercises. No progress yet. Day 3;✅made it through all the exercises twice but threads the needle.  Day4;✅switched the order of the exercise because I get bored. Made it through thread the needle for 2 complete rounds finally. Day5;✅ Day6;✅can get through all the exercises with 2 full sets and the x crunch with 3 full sets.  Day7;✅can get through all the exercises with 3 complete rounds, and abs a little more defined when flexing. Day8;✅not much has changed  Day9;✅not the best day  Day10;  Did another workout today plus this workout too I was getting bored. Day11;✅did both workouts Day12;✅did both workouts Day13;felt good ab definition has not improved  In the end I decided to stop this workout cause I get bored easily when I do the same thing over again. Overall I feel like I got internally stronger but for my physical appearance nothing changed really. I will definitely come back to this workout but not for the 22 day challenge
Day 1- 3am struggl n confusion lol- from ps4 yt
No hate to you at all but I hate these 22 day things suck I get no good burn I feel like I’m doing them wrong the only one I like is the 7 minute one
When I do thread the needle the only place I feel it working is my shoulders why
Do you have a website or a video that I can follow each day? This looks amazing and Im willing to try it.
day 4! day 5! day 6! day 7!  Starting over missed a couple of days but not a big deal!
Starting date: 4/4/2020 Day 1: ✅

No steroids?
Ok so I see a bunch of people starting this exercise and since we all have a lot of time I want to start recording my journey and share it with you guys so yeah let’s get to it and hopefully I can have a 6- pack and a v line by the end of this and also I think I will be doing this longer than 22 days.                                                                    Day 1✅ (I have already done these exercises for a couple days now so I can go 2x on the first four exercises but nothing else)
Hmm idk but for me the heels to the heavens is hard because I have difficulty keeping my upper body on the ground and lifting my legs
My lazy bum in quarantine got me here. Current weight: 90kgs. Day 1: Did 2 sets of first 2 exercises and performed 1 set of the remaining ones due to exhaustion. These exercises are quiet challenging. Looking forward to this challenge with high hopes. 😎😎  Day2:
I'll try this bro thank you for sharing this video God bless

I want to see practical nutritional advice. As the classic saying goes “ you can’t out train a bad diet.” —- So I’d like to see advice on what to eat, and not like the typical advice you see. Something that can be applied to everyday life and be sustainable for an overall healthy life.

I will work hard hoping that I will have a good healthy body like you ,no big stomach ,not a balloon body  like the bodybuilders now a days , hope for you the best ❤️  Day 1✅  Day 2 ✅ Day3✅ Day4✅  Day 5✅
I’m 16 and I’ve been doing these but for some reason I just can’t get abs I’ve tried really hard but idk what the problem is
Talking stops at 1:54
Ok, this time I'm motivated as never.  Starting date 04.01.20 Day 1:
What's the rest between exercises? Also 10s, or how much You need?  Tbh I ain't able to do last exercises after bein burned on previous ones : ?
Ive been doing this for a week now and i didnt even feel sore today
So here's my question Jeff or anyone that can actually answer me. I'm 1m80  80kg , pretty good body and i've got abs. When I flex i have 6 packs easily shown especially with good lighting and on my insta I feel like it's fake if I use structure ect. They're pretty decent , BUT when i'm relaxed I feel like i'm bloated , like all these bodybuilders ( Note that i'm not HUGE , like 80 kg for 1m80 is not much ). Should I do more abs ? Truth is I never do abs,  they mostly work on my squats / pull ups / deadlifts.
Whoever had done this for 22 days tell me if it works

Soreness came back after the workout but it isn't much. Feels good 😅.  Day 3(31/03) : Not much soreness today. Was able to do 2 reps of exercise 1 and 2. Exercise 4 is the hardest. Feels good 😅.  Day 4(01/04) : I can finally see the upper 2 packs. The line is clearly visible and this is motivating me a lot. I did 2 sets of first 3 exercises easily. Feels really great 😅.

So damn Corona just shut down my gym, got me thinking why not try this one out and for once focus on the abs. Starting Date: March 15th                                Day 1: ✅ (it was harder than I expected, lasted about 10-12min, and only resting like 10sec doesn‘t make it easier, let‘s see how it goes)                                           UPDATE: Jeff just uploaded a new video, the perfect home workout plan, so I will switch to that one, since it focuses on the whole body and therefore on the abs too. Well it was fun while it lasted lol
I felt sensations in my abs by just seeing these exercises..

I was able to reach 3 extinctions on each workout and 2x the reps he asked on the first day I'm hoping to triple this or quadruple it lol hoping I have the will power to keep it up because I want a summer body. Could use some inspiration and motivation. Goodluck guys

Does anyone have any tips for the last two exercises? I can get through one set of the first four but I just can’t seem to figure out those last two and I think it’s my form. The jackknifes feel jerky and uncoordinated and I can’t seem to keep my shoulder blades off the ground on the bikes. I’m on day four, so is this normal or is there something I can do to fix it? Any help would be appreciated.
Day 1: 26 mins
You're an inspiration. Not huge, but you look Awesome!
Day 1: ✅(stomach feels loose)
hey ,if anyone else wants to discover toned muscles try Mighty Shortcut Folio (Have a quick look on google cant remember the place now ) ? Ive heard some pretty good things about it and my mate got great success with it.
Day 11
Core exercises strengthen the abs but doesn't burn the fat to be visible,in order for that you would have to do high intensity workout leaving you dripping in sweat and breathing heavily
If i knew the diet plan, id start
Thanks for the vid for stomach crunches
When you do the extinction time do you take a break after doing the 45 and then do another 45?
I love these excercises!
Please English subtitles use sir
Back pain when i do abs workout please tell me the reason sir

Trying this tmr cause I talked to a girl and I'm very strong now 😎
I will try it for sure from tomorrow
X
I'55 and I am going to give this a try. Need to get rid of that spare tire.
is it okay if i did the x-man crunch fast ?
Abs are hard to work out but at least it’s quick
doing this all of march 2020, no excuses. day 1. damn, I always said ab exercises feel the worst. not in a bad way. those first two I almost got two sets of. but the others, I couldn't even do the x man crunchs. they were all difficult. day 2. I wrote a large update about todays progress. but because I hadn't refreshed the page first its all gone. tldr did the thread the needle accurately this time and did much better. was already sore, and stationary bike hit right where it hurt so I gave up probably before my second extinction time, but the gain was horrible. otherwise I'd say today was pretty good, even if i didn't do as well as yesterday. day 3. I almost didn't I completely forgot and when I remembered, I was tired and just wanted to sleep. but I did it anyway. the carpet burn from day 1 is getting better, doing stuff to avoid further carpet burn. did 5 thread the needles. and I completely changed how I thought of the jackknives and was able to do them. I'm understanding the exercises better, and I'm getting better at doing them, even if i've had no physical improvement. day 4: even as of day 5, I'm seeing what seems like improvements, 7 thread the needles. doing the x man crunches (again this all had to do with my way of thinking about them, I was trying to do it wrong) I've put bandaids on my carpet burns because while, I'm not getting anymore, they didn't like the planking, and I'm hoping that the bandaid helps. not giving in yet. or ever. day 5: damn, I thought it was only day 4, today I was just mentally exhausted, I found myself wanting to give up half way through. stopping right before the timer, just so I didn't have to do another set. but todays just a bad day, and I'm exhausted both physically and mentally and I won't let it get to me tomorrow. day 6: I cheated, I know it sounds bad but wait, I avoided plank exercises today, and I will for another couple of days, while I won't get more carpet burns, the one on my left elbow was already pretty bad, and its only getting worse by continuing to put pressure on it, so I won't until it heals. otherwise, I did the others pretty well, especially the stationary bikes. day 7: one week, that means I get a break right? no? damn! not giving in yet. day 8: back to doing all the exercises, I think I've let the carpet burn heal enough to be able to handle the movement of the plank. as for the other exercises, good improvements. best I've done at heels to the heavens. day 9: doing this right before bad after eating is a bad idea. I almost didn't do it today, and almost quit half way through. day 10: I admit, that besides day 1, and today. for the rest of it, I've kind of been half assing the exercises, stopping at one set, even if I could continue. but today I pushed myself and did a full set of evreything except the alternating thread the needle (got to 7 out of ten, literally felt like I was going to vomit after that). did 2 or 3 of some others. I can see I've improved in the last 9 days. I hope I can continue to see improvements. day 11: ✅ day 12: ✅ day 13: ✅ day 14: ✅ (I did it, I just forgot to update this) day 15: ✅ note to self, don't try on bed, while some exercises work, others don't day 16: ✅ day 17: ✅ day 18: ✅ day 19: ✅ day 20: ✅ day 21: ✅ day 22: ✅  having finally completed the 22 day ab exercise. I've changed my mind, I won't be doing it for all of march, I think I'm going to give my abs a break for 1-2 days, then I'll start the 7 minute ab exercise that he has on the channel. my abs are stronger than they were, but they're still very weak. and I don't think I'll continue to do ab exercises every day, I'll do take one day off every couple of days. all muscles need time to heal, and the abs are no different. while I don't regret doing this, at the end it felt like a chore I had to get through before I could go to bed. and I only did it because of this comment.
starting date 29/02/2020 day 1 done day 2 done day 3 done
To start a habbit it doesn't take 22 days it actually takes longer
Starting date: 2/28/20 Day 1✅
Yo this old guy has a nice body but  lacking abs.. looks like a 4 pack to me. Wheres the line under the belly button? Lol
Probably been touched on, but these are incredibly dangerous moves for lower back, especially those with any low back concerns. It’s nearly impossible to keep the back flat to the ground with your core. As your knees cross your hips towards the floor, that back will arch every-time. These are dangerous moves and WILL injury your low back. I’ve trained over 15k sessions in my 20 years and felt it incumbent upon me to share.
Its hard to get the form right
Can u make in hindi language
having a fat layer on stomach ,abs have come but due to fat not visible compeltely will help this exercise
Xman crunches are so are.     Day 1 ✅
You are an old man, put a shirt on I don’t care about ur body.
How many times a day?
Ok Jeff I will take on the 22 day challenge. I watch a lot of your youtube channel. out all the health or fitness trainers. I believe you the most. I'm 58 need to lose some belly fat and tighten up my stomach muscles. will let you know in 22 days. thank you in advance. Terry
So abs everyday is fine?
Starting Date 2/26/20 Day 1 ✅
2/26/2020 Day 1: Couldn't make it past first set for exercises 2, 4, 5, 6 Skip to Day 6: ✅ All exercises completed to at least one set
Gonna start this tomorrow, and at the end of my workout, (leg day and that crap) Ima do this, I’ll give an update every 2 days. Wish me luck yall
I absolutely love this workout. Can’t wait to get home and get started 😬 thanks !
Ight, here we go.   Day 1:✓
this video pops up every day i open youtube i think it’s signaling me to do it, well day 1 starts today. starting date: 02/26/2020
Day 1 success
Thanks for sharing this! This is the real deal, no gym membership and easily adaptable for all ability levels.
Fat loss video comming
I'm starting this 22 days journey today, I'll update the comment as soon as I finish :)
Whenever I try to do an exercise that makes me have my legs hover over the ground and crunch at the same time it makes my lower back feel extremely strange and I cannot perform the exercise as if I was paralyzed someone please help!!!
Yea ... I might look into buying some 😅
If anyone wants to use an alternative because some of these exercises don’t seem to do much, here:   3x10 low leg raises 3x55 bicycle crunches 1:00 plank 3x10 leg circles 3x15 butterfly sit-ups  1:00 flutter kicks 2x20 mountain climbers 2x10 step through planks
S
6.8K clicked dislike since they only did 21 days and didn't get shredded cause they ate like disgusting PIG the entire time.
So I'm a beginner and I'm gonna try to do this. I currently have some relatively visible upper abs right now. So I think this ia perfect to try out for me..
I like trainers that are clothed and have normal body language that doesn’t specially flatter their physique, just talk to me like a regular dude and I trust you more lol
amazing im goin to convine this shorturl.at/tzS26 with this exercise
Nice steroids
These are great workouts. The only criticism I have is that it's extremely difficult to watch the clock for 45 secs while doing these workouts completely
It really helpful. I really get the pressure. Thank u so much trainer. 😊

Hey i just started this workout and i love it but i think im doing the “thread the needle” exercise wrong because i dont feel it in my abs but more of my back. Can someone help ?
Does this work on people who have a little bit a fat like 20 percent
2:12 2:45 3:20 3:50 4:48 5:30
💪👍
I am very thin and i need to increase my weight......please suggest some exercise and dite
Question about the workout. Are you suppose to break between workouts?
My finger tickles :(
I wanna try this “day 1 day 2” thing too 😭😂. Ok I’m 17 and “skinny fat” so skinny with shirt fat shirt off LMAO. I run track and work I hope I have enough will power to do it 😩(also doing push-ups)  Day 1 : ✅ Day 2 : ✅ (took me til 12 cause I didn’t wanna do it so bad  Day 3 : 🚫(the reason I didn’t do it was because I did ab workouts during track practice and they hurt so bad to where it hurt when I got out a chair or sat down)
Was my First day today. Its not easy at all. But will do for 22 days. And Let's See the change. See ya
Phew its hurt af
Even his face is ripped
There are two possible outcomes of this.  Either you end up looking like this guy... or you look like the guy at the back.
*WORKOUT:*  1:50 - HEELS TO THE HEAVENS:            Extinction: 45 seconds   2:38 - STEP THROUGH PLANKS            Extinction: 45 seconds  3:20 - “X” MAN CRUNCH            Extinction: 12 REPS  3:53 - ALRERNATING THREAD THE NEEDLE             Extinction: 10 REPS - EACH side  4:49 - ALTERNATING JACKKNIVES            Extinction: 45 seconds  5:24 - STATIONARY BIKES            Extinction: 30 seconds   (If you are able to complete an exercise within the “Extinction” time, REST for 10 seconds, and then REPEAT THE EXERCISE)  Edit: Please, for the love of God, if you have any questions, just read the comments. 90% of the time I’ve already answered your question. Thank you.
I give up
I will start tomorow
I’m starting today I’ve got to get abs because I’m actually very fat 😂 but I’m gonna come back 1 month later and explain the results 1 day=good to go not tired 2 days=got a soar stomach and a soar shoulder but no giving up so I’m still doing it Day 3=starting to feel abs in my stomach 4 day= I cant give up I got little abs popping out yayyyyyy 5 day= i can’t even explain the result
The dramatic downside of being so lean is a very old face. I'm sure he's much younger than he looks. The body is great but when he's wearing clothes - everyone seens his thin and old face.
@ATHLEAN-X ... should we do it on daily basis or on alternate days
What foods eat after exercise
Hows the results community ??
February 19, 2020 Day 1:✅ Day 2:✅ Day 3:✅ Day 4:✅ Day 5:✅ Day 6:✅ Day 7:✅ Day 8:✅ Day 9:✅ Day 10:✅ Day 11:✅ Day 12:✅ Day 13:✅ Day 14:✅ Day 15:✅ Day 16:✅ Day 17:✅ Day 18:✅ Day 19:✅ Day 20:✅Almost there Day 21:✅ Day 22✅ March 14, 2020 I am finally done. After many days I have finished all 22 days. I had to miss a few days, but I made up for them. I started with an outline of a six pac, but it looked fat and uneven. Today It is still and outline, but a very strong outline that looks really close to an actual six pac. I would very much encourage all to do this. This works.
The 45s and repeat or next exercise is  Very Smart thing🔥
This is a great workout  Saw results very quickly
My abs have been neglected for years and only just started back at gym after a 1.5.yr health related period of being sedimentary so even doing a crunch and lifting shoulder blades off of the floor is impossible, so this is gonna be hell

Nice sir,,,,,,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZd_CsXgy9QvUvmSfXFE8TQ
Sir, what is your age?
I’ve been doing it everyday for 7 days going for 22 and all but can’t anyone answer me about if it’s actually smarter to not do it like every once in awhile to let the muscles heal?
So do I do this everyday, even on weekends?
This is 🔥
Very good
The color looks like a Kenyan flag 🇰🇪

I’m here because I’m a member of this community that performs in special events and in one of their dances you have to be half naked like you only wear pants and no shirt on top. It’s gonna be so embarrassing because I’m kind of fat. I think I have 25-30% body fat. Do these workouts even work? Can I get pretty toned body in just 22 days? I’m not planning on taking like 2 or 3 day breaks. I want to work out 22 days straight. Can I do that?
Hii  I want grow my body weight and body size without supplements.is it possible ?please tell me if you have any thought so suggest me .
Just want to ask one thing that how many sets i have to do of every exercise I am doing abs workout from last 3 months but they are not that good in defining abs and i am also on a very strict healthy diet too but still can't see satisfactory results as the amount of workout i do
My 1st day today.. I completed it nicely.. this workout is nice.. really burnin
Christian Bale is now teaching us his ways
He is bloody strong
Is it normal to go into extinction 4 times with the x man crunch even for a 13 year old 😂
Week 1 in the chamber : I feel like a fat bitch but I’m working on being a bad bitch, every time I feel like chewing on times I shouldn’t I’ll be drinking water.( see y’all in week 2) ✌🏻
Starting 13.02.2020  (before Valentines day)🥰 Day 01

Day 1 : no
10.2.2020   I can barely see an abs outline. I haven’t trained them very much even though I’m going consistently to the gym. Atm I am at a 13% body fat count and I’m excited for the result in 22 days. Trying to keep you all updated. Wish me good luck :)  Day 1: ✅ Day 2: ✅ I definitely can feel the first day but I love the burn  Day 3: ✅ Day 4: ✅ Day 5: Day 6: Day 7: Day 8: Day 9: Day 10: Day 11: Day 12: Day 13: Day 14: Day 15: Day 16: Day 17: Day 18: Day 19: Day 20: Day 21: Day 22:  *Result* :
Is there a version to the 1st ex (heels to the heaven) that can be executed instead? my problem is I contract too much of my upper back+neck+chest muscles  when I try to lift the pelvis from the ground. Also it feels like a rather cheat/jerky move when I do it - no control on the pelvis going-up/down part of the ex. I have lower back and neck hernias. Thank you so much
Does this burn fat?

Jeff, this is about to be on! Let’s gooooo! 22 days I am going to die...but I will for sure give you an update! Let’s get it!
Day 1 will start tomorrow 😏
I am 17 and I want to lose wait this year so I am going to try this and see what happens   Day 1 was hard for me but I did my best✅ Day 2✅ Day3✅
Started 17/2/2020 Here we go heh  Day 1. ✅ Struggled quite a bit, some of which due to strained stomach muscles
Gave this another go with no exceptions- started Feb 6-2020.  Day 1: ✔️one round through most before failure (hardly on the last two); 3 rounds on X-man's before failure. Day 2: ✔️ Day 3 -✔️ Day 4: - ✔️ 5: ✔️ Day 6: ✔️ Day 7: ✅ Day 8:✔️ *Most recent- sets completed before xtinct:  H2H- Three!; Step through P- one; X-Man Cr. - four; Alt threads- 2; alt Jackknives- one; Stat bike- two * Day 9:✔️ 10: ✔️ 11: ✔️ (halfway done yay)12: ✔️ 13:✅ (Tues) 14:✔️ 15:✔️ 16:✔️ 17: ✔️ 18: ✔️ 19:✅ 20:✅  21: ✅ 22:✅✅✅ DID IT!  Late to the game and no love from the youtube commenters, but thank you Jeff C!! As a marathoner, wrestling coach, athlete etc. a six pack has been a long time coming and this truly helped me get closer to lower body fat goals and stronger abs—there is a visibly noticeable difference.   Going for at least one extra day tonight, b/c I wanted to go hard once more (then think I'll maintain a variation 3 days/wk and try to get a calorie deficit going for a few weeks/until I reach my body goal).
Is there a rest between the exercises or we just move from one to the other immediately after we finished the previous one?
Starting Date 2/4/20 Day 1:✅Workouts were hard but i finished Day 2:✅Did every exercise until failure 2x Day 3:✅ Day 4:

Starting Date 1/27/20 First Day:✅
Excelent!!!
Hey guys, I've decided to start the 22 days today. My first impression is that I must be using my hip flexor muscles too much. Getting my legs into position is nice and easy, but heaving this torso out of the floor feels grueling. As a result, some exercises felt much easier, and in some, just getting a semblance of a correct posture was near impossible. I never realized I was that weak, damn. I've got one more pretty decent motivation to push through the next 21 days, now.
Question should I wait a few days to let my muscle rebuild bc the soreness is muscle that got teared down so wait or keep going
Been doing this mixed with some of the other abs exercises he's showed in other videos. You have to be consistent and give your all in these 7,10 or 15 minutes. My goal after a week is to start keeping up with Jeff's tempo, but more importantly to perform quality reps.
Hello! Going to try this out for a month. Already tried day 1 and it totally killed my abs. But the results afterwards were 100% noticeable in the burn I got at the end. Cant wait to see what the transformation will be like
Starting day 1/25/2020, 17, 120 lbs 5’6 male with some belly fat I wanna get rid of. By the end I hope I can visibly see abs. For my diet I will be sticking to dinner & lunch only plus a protein shake, no snacks. Will also include 30 mins of jump rope wish me lucky guys :)  1st day ✅ 2nd ✅ 3rd  4th  5th 6th 7th 8th 9th  10th 11th 12th 13th 14th 15th 16th 17th 18th 19th 20th 21st 22nd
I Will be doing this EVERY DAY for as long as I can, will send picture results for the first month if asked  Day one - ✅ Day two - ✅ Day three - ✅ Day four - ✅ Day five - ✅ Day six - ✅ Day seven - ✅ Day eight - ✅ Day nine - ✅ Day ten - ✅ Day eleven - ✅
Day I watch this video: ✓
Ill do these everyday and show u guys progression pics after 22 days to see if it actually works
Substitute for second last workout
Starting day 1/23/20 1✅
F yes here we go!! Starting 2020 January 23 Day 1 ✅ Day 2 ✅ (pretty hard but did at least 1 set of everything) Day 3 ✅ (lesson learned: don't do this when you're hungry) Day 4 ✅ started paying attention to technique and control to maximize hypertrophy (lesson learned: don't do this within an hour of eating a big bowl of oatmeal 😂) Day 5 ✅ (today was much easier. I felt an awesome energy to push myself further and do way more reps with way more control and attention) Day 6 ✅ (I almost missed this day because I'm busy with other projects but I caught myself and willed it out!) Day 7 ✅ (Going strong for a week straight! (Pretty much my longest workout streak ever 😂)) Day 8 ✅ Day 9 ✅ (Today's session was very hard to get started with and carry through, but I did it. It never really was a question wether I should do it or not.) Day 10 ✅ Day 11 ✅ Day 12 ✅ Day 13 ✅ Day 14 ✅ Day 15 ✅ Day 16 ✅ Day 17 ✅ (Quite surprisingly, it's getting harder and harder to stay consistent but so far I haven't missed a day. My longest ever workout streak continues!!) Day 18 ✅ Day 19 ✅ Day 20 ✅ Day 21 ❌ GUESS WHAT. I MISSED THE DAY BEFORE THE LAST. I DON'T GIVE A SHIT because I'm a lot stronger, I can ride my bike better and stronger because of this, and I just simply won't stop working out 99% of the days ahead. THANK YOU JEFF!! Day 22 ✅ Yes! I made it through. I'm feeling much stronger and have a lot more control throughout the movements compared to the first day. I can even say there's a little visible improvement though not much 😂 It's a great program and I'm gonna do it straight again. This time I will be focusing on actually improving endurance and set counts as I was focusing more on strength and control this past 22 days. Can't wait for tomorrows session. Day 23 ❌(Feb 14) Day 24 ❌ Day 25 ❌ Day 26 ❌ Day 27 ❌ Day 28 ✅ (Heck it's always nice to be sick for a week. Good start to my second round 😂👊 Actually the rest did it's job, I feel much stronger now!) Day 29 Day 30 Day 31 Day 32 Day 33 Day 34 Day 35 Day 36 Day 37 Day 38 Day 39 Day 40 Day 41 Day 42 Day 43 Day 44 (March 6)

Starting today: Day 1:✅ Day 2:✅
Awesome awesome I just started watching your videos and can’t say enough how I already had many of the same principle ideas on fitness your philosophy falls in line with mine, I will be signing up in a program I’m a firm believer in I owe myself 20 minutes a day if not more to physical training ps this will be the first workout program I join I did watch a P90X and I guess I didn’t like the mans personality , thank you for knowledge it’s truly a irreplaceable asset
Starting this today, sick as shit, but let's see how it goes
12 year old day 2 trying it out my core is kinda sore already but I'mma keep pushing
This looks bad for your back
i got thru until i couldn't do 1 jack knife crunch lmao I started laughing
Is it healthy to incorporate this 22 day training system and still continue to do your normal upper/lower body workout days or whatever you were doing before?
k lol
gonna be doing this all 22days “14 year old”  day 1 ✅ instead of jackhammers i’m doing scissor kicks day 2 ✅
Starting date - January 14, 2020  1. 2020.01.14 - Done! 2. 2020.01.15 - Done! 3. 2020.01.16 - nearly threw up, but done! 4. 2020.01.17 - woke up late... needed to dash to work. Later!
Why my back hurting
New ab workout replacement for me. 2 months deep and feeling great. Thanks for the video and for the inspiration!
You really are brilliant at this. This is your genius.
If I have quite a bit of stomach fat, should I be trying to eat clean and lose it before doing ab workouts or should I do abs alongside my other workouts?
Starting this tomorrow, wish me luck!🙏 Day 1: Completed Day 2: Completed (a bit of improvement already) Day 3: Completed Day 4: Completed Day 5: Completed (Starting to see major improvement at this stage) Day 6: Completed Day 7: Completed (First week! :D) Day 8: Completed
Day 4 and I still reach Extinction in every workout
You don't exercise enough and you're not ripped enough keep trying
Thanks for this! I like how you simplify this for any level. Definitely not easy, but a great focused goal. I've started incorporating fitness into my channel. I'm subscribing to your channel for inspiration. Subscribe if you like mine.
Started today... I'm a skinny guy, doing quite a lot of climbing and thought I'd have an ok core... 1) Was not too bad; maybe should've done another one 2) Same as above 3) Can bring max 6 reps with sacrificing form pretty early on and loading my back 4) Those I can do, but they are sooo taxing; I'm really out of breath after those 5) So this is where it's falling apart completely... can do like 5 sec 6) Hard but doable   Really interested in the improvements for 3) and 5) as they do feel kinda impossible at the moment
Don't skip chest day @athleanx
Those dislikes aren't even trying 😂😁😎
What are the chances of tearing something without any rest doing this? That's my only concern.
Starting Date:01/10/20 Day 1👍🏻
i go running every morning is it ok to keep it while doing this programm?
What should I eat along with this workout
When I am doing crunches, sit ups, etc... is it okay if my neck is really tense?
Thank you for the tip it will be implemented in the #Iercise.... #codezwebseriez

It takes 21 days to fully program your self into a natural routine, so if you can do the full 22 days you might as well or will do it for longer. Most likely :)   This was RANDOM asf :/
Wrote it down, bout crack it out tomm at 6 hello sexies
Day 1👌
I am being totally honest, i have a medium belly and as 2020 i am going to start this exercise for 22 days and give my honest opinion 😊. Wish me luck and please motivate me not to stop. Day 1 :-    ✅ ( I could do 3 sets the first exercise  but only one of other 5 exercise and was struggling for it. My abs was little sore and it was not painful)  Day 2 :-    ✅ ( when i started the first exercise my stomach started paining but I didn’t give up and continue doing my exercises and after completing the second exercise my pain started to fade away. My core was sore all day long.   Day 3 :-   ✅  ( my stomach was sore but it faded away after first exercise but i am still struggling to complete my all exercise. my stomach was not sore all day long.  Day 4 :-   ✅ (my stomach was little sore in the first exercise but it faded eventually. I am still struggling to complete all the exercises. No pain after workout)
Day 1: ✅
I'm going to do this, pls gimme some motivation to do this :) i'l edit evryday to let u guys know if the workout works for me :)   Starting date : 6 january 2020  Day 1 : fell rlly pain in my whole abs, tough only the x crunch i can do 20 reps, the other not to good, almost not done to 45 sec ( but i done it and really sweat a lot ✔️✔️)  Day 2 : perfectly done but still sour Day 3 : perfectly done but still sour Day 4 : perfectly done but still sour Day 5 : kinda lazy to do so just do it a bit hehehe Day 6 : done it with so much effort that my stomach hurt badly :( Day 7 : didn't do it coz feelin rlly bad on my stomach from yesterday Day 8 : not doin it my butt hurt alott,it's got bited from an fckin bigg ants lol barelly can't sit properly :'( so no sit up for a whilr huh
Umm i have a question, do we do the wprkout just once a day?, since i'm doing mine like twice a day( not this eorkout thought) it made a line in my upper abs but again i think bcos i'm too fat and the abs was hide behind my fat lol, tbh how to be lose weight more is dificult, what em i wanna comment again? 🤣 I forgot lol
Got the Athlean Xero program and wanted to know how Xtinction works. Glad I found this. 💪💪
Day1 Day3 still a struggle but definitely worth it
How many sets we have to do
How to loss my tummy fat to show my abs? I can see shape and feel then but them covered by fat. :( I am active , 5 times weight and 2 times P90x . I am a over 45 yr old woman. LOL but looks like a 25. thanks
*whistles* I'm starting this today. Will edit this comment everyday on completion.   Day 1 done. Learned concrete flooring isn't the most comfortable in doing this workout.  Day 2 just finished it after a long day.  Day 3 completed after returning home in the late evening. Noticed I could do a little more. I still don't like the X one lol.  Day 4 Feeling great today. Doesn't hurt as much. I've taken the liberty to place towels and a blanket on the floor to cushion the concrete  Day 5 Hips are hurting but other than that I'm doing good.  Day 6 I'm able to go longer. I feel a tad bit stronger..  Day 7 did some cardio before the abs workout. Really tiring and sweaty.  Day 8 done and done.  Day 9 done and I'm getting a trainer 😆  Day 10 Did it with my trainer. She has a challenge for me tomorrow 👀
I’ve decided to start this challenge with a decent set of abs but not defined. I will stack this on top of my daily workouts and update daily with results. Starting date: 1/3/20  Day 1: ✅
Starting 1/3/20 Day1: ✅ Day2: ✅ Alright guy, today I've been depressed at shit. Ive barely had two meals and was just about to say fuck it to today's work out. But I started listening to hype music and here I am.  Day3: ✅ Day4: ✅ Soo day four is done. Changes I've experienced so far: my extinction time is much shorter. I'm sore as fuck. I added an explosion crunch to the end because I'm not feeling like enough is being done to my upper abs. And my breathing technique has definitely improved. 🤙 See you tomorrow. Day5: ✅ Ended up waiting all day cuz for some reason my thighs are burning from the heels to heaven and I figured my form was off. Still feel like most of the workout is targeting my lower abdomen. Just FYI guys I'm a skinny ass dude. 5'9" weighing 125lbs. I've always had a little muscle but now since I'm working out everyday I can see my v line all the time and my abdomen looks bigger than it did. I'm going to be doing this every day from now on. Just seeing my v line forming isna huge confidence booster, even though my upper abs aren't really coming in yet. Day6: ✅ Day7: ✅  Alright so I technically missed a day. It's 4am, I'm exhausted. Doing two sessions today I guess.
I’m gonna try this wish me luck   Day 1: ✅ (hard but finally did it) Day 2: ✅ (bit easier than yesterday) Day 3: ✅ Day 4: ✅ (I cant feel the pain any more, I think I’m doing good) Day 5: ✅ Day 6: ✅ Day 7: ✅ Sorry I stoped guys but I was kinda busy
First day doin this particular ab workout  Had pains in my shoulder,thigh,Tommy ,legs Am wondering if I did some of them wrong ? I used to do another of your routine Athlean  I really love this one it's a burner,! Am sticking to it For some of the routines here am having problems balancing my hands or how to place them hence the shoulder pains same as when I do push ups  Want to know areas where you feel work out burna oe pain doin this exercise
Hi, if my back hurts me while doing this should I stop? Or is it normal?
I don’t know if it’s just because it’s one of the later exercises but I find the Thread The Needle one to be very difficult and the Jack Knives are a very close second.
Nice😊
Hey guys can someone help me out? Do we do these every day or do we have intervals? Or do the abdomen muscles just heal much faster and we can do ab workouts every day? Im just confused and not entirely sure
Can i do this everyday even after 22 days and no rest?
From today(29/12) i start to do this workout .. I have no abs but i will try. Day 1.-✔(it was really hard but i will continue with progress) Day 2-✔(damn this is hard, but i wont give up)

I literally felt this workout everywhere but my abs my chest quads back this is so bad idk what to do
I tried this and it took me so many sets to get to extinction on the starfish crunches and could do anything bottom up, should I change how I’m doing this, also despite my form and how slow I go I only feel it in my upper quads and lower back
Can I do abs workout daily? I mean   is it give result
Not easy workout no matter the level just like he said, have to do everything about five times even if I do it with the best form amd that's the only problem. Time consuming but worth it. I've done plenty of an training before but this seems to be getting just the right spots👌🏼
Start: 19 Dec 2019  Day 1 : ✔ Did a set for each exercise, could've pushed further. Forearm sore from friction between floor and forearm during Needle and thread.

Jeff... Day 1, I spent 15 mins on the first exercise, 15 mins on the second. At that rate it would take me about an hour to complete the entire workout. I doing this right?

Starting this at 12/08/19, current weight 162, visible abs if I hold my breath Day 1: 👍
boys here we go
I like it
Thank you for sharing. I will do it for the month of December.
It’s bulking season boys, 18 years old, prob around 12% bf at most, abs are already good (especially when I either get a great pump or lean enough), weight 165 lbs and I work abs everyday already, I do leg raises (normal and bringing my legs all the way up) and cable workouts, I’ll tell you guys my journey and I’ll redo this while cutting so you can see better results when I’m lean @byron.austin_ is my Instagram  Day 1:
Starting Date: 12/1/19 Day 1: ✅ Day 2: ✅ Day 3: ✅ Day 4: ✅ Day 5: ✅ Day 6: ✅ Day 7: ✅ (took my SATs 😬) Day 8: ✅ Day 9: ✅ Day 10: ✅ Day 11: ✅ (50% done! it's working so far!) Day 12: ✅ Day 13: ✅ Day 14: ✅ Day 15: ✅ Day 16: ✅ Day 17: ✅ Day 18: ✅ Day 19: ✅ Day 20: ✅ (1340 on the SATs!!!) Day 21: ✅ Day 22: ✅ Ending Date: 12/22/19 Result: Almost a month later and I'm really glad I did this. My core is soo much stronger, and I have an outline of a six pack. Obviously, nothing like the guy in the video, but definitely a start. I found that the exercises get easier and easier the more I do them, and I can do way more reps than I was able to day 1. I wanna thank everyone that replied with messages of encouragement, I really enjoyed coming back to this comment and reading the new messages every day. I'm not going to stop because it feels natural now, but I think I'll take one or two rest days a week. I'm also going to eat a healthier diet. But this is the step in the right direction, I've been scrawny for way to long. A great way to end my decade, looking forward to 2020!
"Nobody is getting an easy workout here" I love it. Awesome and badass :)
hey guys.. im fat 1 like = motivation
Good One, I am really struggling with my Tummy Fat, I will give it a try
This seems easy but if you do them properly ( as much as you can anyways) its INTENSE!
Does it okay if I eat fried fish or fried chicken while doing this 22 days abs?
Starting this. Will post daily updates of what I learned. 1. Hard! Don't do this on a rough surface like a carpet. You WILL get rug burn 2. Took me a lot longer to do the reps this time. Sore from yesterday 3. This was so hard. I can normally do at least twice on everything. I hit extinction on the 1st time through on some today. Hated every minute. Feels good.
Yes my six pack come in 34 days it's really helpful your  six pack come also all the best
Day 1: Did some of them with bad form, still did them Day 2:I'm sore, my upper and bottom abs are hurting, obliques a bit less, did the training, less "Thread The Needle" but more time on "Stationary Bikes" and "Heels to the Heavens"
I should finish today, November 22nd, but I have skipped three times along the past few weeks (I mean, not consecutive skips) I'm five minutes away from beginning my workout. I do like 6 or 7 sets of each exercise just so it won't take me longer than an hour or so. Today is my 19th day. I would like some of you guys to reply here with your own experience, and also, tell me if it's a good idea to workout at midnight. I'm not studying, so I get fair rest (about 8 or 10 hours). Is it a good idea to workout this late? I've heard it is, because it's a time of the day when you have plenty of oxygen available 🤷🏻‍♂️ correct me if I'm wrong
3:20 “Photosynthesis......Photosynthesis”
Is everyone going to ignore that he wrapped a lav mic around his neck and pinned it to itself? Just wear a shirt dude.
Can I do this while bulking ?
How many sets? Please answer pleaseee
Most of these exercises puts a lot of pressure on my lower back and that is what causes me to stop eventually more than the tension in the abs. Don’t know if that’s normal :(
Is it allgood to do this after a hour workout when I get home?
Yesterday was day 18 completed, continuing today
Let's go let's do this Day one: ✔
I’m gonna try this with a picture everyday.  10.16.2019
Day 17 completed, I had an awesome workout.
Does Jeff even own more than 2 t-shirts ?
Hi jeff
Day 16 completed, fact about this training, my health conscious mind is away on due to the hard work I am putting in, also even when am not in gym but anywhere I still train.
digonale planck????
With day 15 completed, I my diet is on maximum point, I am pushing harder on a strict diet, fasting 16 hours/8 hours time frame to eat. I have 7 days remaining.
Day 15, completed
Day 14 completed , I felt really good continuing my journey. I really love it. My diet has come back on point.
Sir, is it ok if i do more than 1 workouts  a day?
Day 13 completed, my progress is the my abs, is slightly showing, but my diet is not on point so going to address this now.
I'm starting this today with my regular workout, wish me luck!! Definitely will post my journey through the 22 Days.  Day 1: Almost dead (this guy makes it look so easy haha) Day 2: abdomen burns but still fighting it! Day 3: man this thing is difficult... Day 4: it starts to hurt less but still burns... I'm not defeated yet! Day 5: less burn, more control over movements Day 6: controlled movements still burns but not giving up!! Day 7: getting the handle of it, 15 days to go!! Day 8: burn is almost gone! \m/ Day 9: my only limitation now is neck pain, but will eventually get control of it! Day 10: I've level up! I added a couple more of reps on each exercise. Day 11: Half way there! Day 12: Going strong, starting to see some progress \m/ Day 13: Getting better each day! Day 14: Easier to handle it, increasing the level each time! Day 15: one week away and core feeling stronger! Day 16: not giving up for a second!! \m/ Day 17: increased the intensity a bit, 5 days more to go! Day 18: slowly reaching the goal! Day 19: almost there... Day 20: definetly feeling the core stronger! \m/ Day 21: one more day to go! Day 22: the end of the road!  Definitely recommended, very demanding... Perhaps you don't get to see too much visual progress but man, you get way stronger in the core! \m/  Thank you Jeff!!
Day 12 completed, I mostly lasted one to two rounds in almost each exercise. Its a awesome challenge.
Is that good to do 22 days with no day off?(i mean muscles need to regen..)
Sorry for commenting late, finally on the half mark, yesterday was day 11 completed. was so tired after doing the challenge plus the new scheduled workout.
3 reps of Heels to the Heavens and I am crushing my spine...
Day 10, completed, I had a great sleep so I was able to increase my time on each exercises.
Stepping back to tone my body after about 2 years of no exercise cause studies, I'll update day by day  Day 1: My shirt is a shade darker with sweat, I remember this strain from the exercises when I was regular, I have a feeling this will be effective. Day 2: feeling like a Trainwreck but I can "feel" progress, nothing notable as of now Day 3&4 together: couldn't update yesterday, my net went down, I think this is cause I used to have a toned body, I can feel the grooves forming, and in certain lighting conditions, abs are visible, cheers! Update, day 11 or day 1 now, I fell sick, the routine broke, now starting all over again
Day 9 completed, barely made it. Was so tired, like I lasted 1 minute each exercise.
Yes,  Starting now 11-8-2019 My current wieght is 219 After 22 days i will post my  Results 11-30-2019
I surely recommend everyone to do them. Just increase the amount gradually and you’ll definitely get a six pack in 2 months.
"45 seconds... this is your extinction level"
Day 8 completed, Again, heals to the heaven is like the good start of point that makes the other exercises tougher to do, like the jack knife and the x man crunch.
I’ve been doing all these every night before I shower for the past 64 days or two months basically and my abs formed over the first month now there getting defined to the point where I don’t even have to flex ...I’m 20 and play basketball 6’3 200 pounds so I do cardio regularly maybe that plays a part in it too. My diet is decent not bad or good so if I can do it you can too let’s get this body before summer time fellas
Should we do a AB Workout before the Cardio +Weight Workout or We Should do in another separate time in a Day or in the end of Workout.
🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤❤️
How to tone leaner? I lost 6 lbs then stopped.  I train weight lifting and p90x then just can not get leaner!? By the, I am a vegetarian . I eat lentil, chickpeas, peas, Soy for my protein. I eat a lot of veggies, very little fruits.
What do you do after the 22 days?
DAY 7 completed, its amazing how this abs workout, has me sweating while focused is on doing slow and stead movements.
Awesome👏I will definitely give this a go👍
How do i know if  i made any progress at all. Also is it bad to arch my back when doing these workouts?
Day 6 completed, consistency is the key.
I will do this challenge Day 1 ✅ very hard Day 2  still hard Day 3 still hard  Day 4 not easy  Day 5 abs hurt bad  Day 6 abs hurt worse  Day 7 getting easier  Day 8 done Day 9 done Day 10 done Day 11 done Day 12 done Day 13 done Day 14 done  Day 15 getting easier  Day 16 same as day 15 Day 17 same as day 16 Day 18 I’m crying I’m so sore  Day 19 same as day 18 Day 20 Day 21 Day 22
As I go along my challenge, I will update. This is day 5 into the challenge that is completed, its more harder into the middle of the workout like jack knife or even the x-man crunch
Anybody else failed miserably?
day 3 in to the challenge, it's getting tougher as I am training my abs constantly.
I am training for like a couple of years but seriously for like less than a year. Took me about 15/20' to finish it all(more reps the first 2exercises, like1 or2 later on ) and a bunch of the very last one). Do you have something more intense and faster in your videos?(I'm a poor PhD student that can't afford the AthleanX subscription. Sorry😅). Big respect for what you do and how you do it. You're very motivating.

There is a small problem with this, i did this a while ago and plan to do it again. Problem, starting out, i started to die within 5 minutes, after a month all trainings started to take up 1 hour up to 1,5 hours,  i felt like i'm reaching a treshold where i can do that for a time that i'm not comfotable spending.
Hi im going to update my progress:  Day 1: i almost die, it hurts alot, i  do half of all the exercises and i take more than 10 secs to rest sorry i hope tomorrow works better .  Day 2: im sick not work for me today :(  After 6 days im going to star again. :$   Day 1:

I’m gonna do this I’ll update yaull everyday
"we're training like an athlete, this is just a glimpse of that" :O
Should you do this everyday? I thought doing the same workout everyday isn't good?
I can do a shit ton of jack knives, like waaaaaay more than all the other exercises. I'm assuming it's because it's the closest thing to a normal crunch and I've been training that part of my abs for a while but still.
Hope this goes well Day1 my but is sweaty and my upper chest is sore
How much times do u do this per day?
I'm only eight days into this 22 day program and I am already noticing results in my abdominal muscles. Finally, I am getting a cut. I have what is annoyingly called skinny fat. Not much, but just enough to be irritating and in the way of my abdominal muscles. Thank you for being generous with your knowledge. I can't wait until I see the results at twenty-two days!
I can't stop looking at this guy . Is that just me ? No homo .
4:50 baby shark do do do do do doo...
The stationary bikes cause me crazy pain in my lower back after about 10 seconds. I don't otherwise have any back pain in life. Am I doing something wrong?
Guys whenever i try ab workouts i don’t know why but my bak hurts ... its like at the lower end of my spine .. is it normal or is it just me ?
Without Gab 22 days?? no problem na???
You give video on home work outs can be better
Just to know, what's your age sir? You are so fit
Are you Obama?? ❓❔
and what for those with shortened sartorius?
👍
If we do this regularly for 1 month can we see improve in our abs
this guy's got muscles on top of his muscles
55 seconds in  ‘What were gonna do is make it adaptawabable’
Im going back and forth between this workout and another one I found. So one day on this workout and another day on the other workout I found. I will do this for 30 days straight, along with pushups and some more core to add to it. Is it true that if I do this everyday I won't get results as fast? Don't you need rest time? I was gonna do core everyday for 30 days and then when those days are over do it 3-4 days a week so I have rest days. Thanks
You are so awesome! I watch every single morning during my cardio. I really enjoy the videos with Jesse as well! I appreciate your time and knowledge! Kudos to you for all your years of training, education and science-based approach that leads to RESULTS!!
2:45 instructions not clear. I'm in a wheel chair now.
How many should I do per day?
I'm not sure if I've got the coordination for this
1. 2:00 2. 2:45 3. 3:30 4. 3:55 5. 4:50 6. 5:35

haha shit there is 22 days left in october...
Well, everyone else is doing it, and it seems like it’s a good idea for the purpose of giving myself a commitment so, here we go.  Every day ab training diary:  Test run: Completed, I did each exercise pretty terribly, it just goes to show I need more strength.  Day 1: Completed, the X-Man Crunch is almost impossible to even do 1 rep properly, and my limbs smash into the ground after each one, hopefully this will improve over time.  Day 2: Completed, I still feel like some of the exercises aren’t going too well, but at least it feels easier than yesterday. I was a bit concerned that my abs were gonna burn from yesterday, but honestly, I don’t feel any real pain.  Day 3: Completed, I feel it getting slightly easier, if even it it’s only marginal. Note; that’s only in the sense that I feel the exercise execution getting better; I’m still getting an intense feeling workout.  Day 4: Completed, my range of motion on Heels to the Heavens is gradually improving, and it feels great to see the progress. Still can’t do all 12 X-man crunches, but I’m getting there.  Day 5: Completed, I finally got to 10 reps each side on Thread the Needle, although my form wasn’t perfect the whole time (I could feel my lower back dipping down at points)  Day 6: Completed, finally got more than 1 round of X-Man crunches. I still can’t do all 12 with perfect form, but it was good enough for now. I also fell on the Thread the Needle and that messed me up a little, but hey, my sides still burnt sufficiently towards the end, so I think it’s all good.  Day 7: Completed, I did it at the end of a regular workout this time so I was depleted and didn’t do so well. Ah whatevs, I’ll do it right tomorrow.  Day 8: Completed, messed up Thread the Needle, otherwise still relatively ok. I forgot to mention that my Stationairy Bike is pretty bad, because I can’t keep my shoulder blades off the ground for more than like a second, so that’s an exercise I just have to keep trying at.  Day 9: Completed, I actually completely forgot about this yesterday, so that day doesn’t count, meaning this is extended. I did pretty badly, maybe because I was neglectful yesterday.  Day 10: Completed, I’ve still yet to develop visible abs, but that’s probably because I’m not very lean in the first place.  Day 11: Completed, I’m starting to see my Thread the Needle form improve, which is nice.  Day 12: Completed, I tried doing the abs in the gym alongside my other exercises, but I did them at the beginning instead of at the end and it went WAY better than doing them last. Gonna stick to this method the days I go to the gym.  Day 13: Completed, this time I forgot to do them until the end of the workout, so my results were slightly worse, but still pretty good. Gonna hit the treadmill to finish things off today, and I plan to do so for 25-30 minutes 5 days a week from now on.  Day 14: Completed, I did them at the end again, I think this might become a habit. I’m gonna try to remember tomorrow to do it at the beginning but we’ll see.  Day 15: Completed, I got to round 2 of Step Through Planks for the first time, which feels nice. Overall, I’m seeing performance progress, and that’s the most important part for me.  Day 16: Completed, I did okay today, I guess. Nothing in particular to report.  Day 17: Completed, I did well today too, even though it was at the end of the workout, which I take as a good sign.  Day 18: Completed, I keep doing them at the end of every workout, but honestly that’s fine at this point. I’m closing in on the end of this and I have to say it’s been a blast so far.  Day 19: Completed, I almost got 2 full rounds of step through planks today, feeling good about that.  Day 20: Completed, I did 3 rounds of stationary bikes today, feels good.  Day 21: Completed, I felt pretty weak today compared to usual, dunno why really.  Day 22: Completed; this is it, hope today goes well as a send off.  Alright, we at the end. The final round went well, all things considered. I almost got 2 whole rounds of alternating jackknives, so that’s cool. This was a fun experience for me, even if I fucked up a couple times, would definitely recommend this!
My weight is 54 if I do abs workout is my weight increase or not and I am 6feet tall
Hey guys. Please hold me to this. I want to start this and will update this each day. Comment below if I don’t! 👍🏼 Day 1:
While having this set for chest , my tricep gets pain, does i am doing my right?
Scientists have been so wrong! For decades they told us the dinosaurs died out due to a crashing asteroid. CLEARLY they tried to do this workout and went to extinction.
Sir please translate in hindi
"Nothing worth having should come easy"
Well lets try:  1st of all I don't have a specialized diet, I eat whatever but I do mostly drink water, I rarely drink sodas. I am in a little shape, didn't do any other training before this. Lets start!  Day 1: Training went good, I don't feel that sore after it.  Day 2: My stomach has hurt the whole day from day 1's training, managed to do the training almost as well as day 1.  Day 3: My stomach was hurting me a bit, but I did the workout better than the 2 previous days.
Give me 22 likes for 22days 😎

Wait so do you do each workout once then do it again, or do one workout as many times as you can and move on to the second workout. If second option how much time between each workout
Tnks bro
Okay so I have done other ab workouts for 3 months already. Now, I will start this workout. I know many have already updated their success but I am doing it as well. For those interested, please watch for my comments that I will post in this comment. I will update everyday.  Day 1: It was hard af. Everything was really difficult. He was right to say that every level can do this workout. When I finished my abs were sore and I was drained. Day 2: Same like day 1 but I have to say that there is a problem. The fifth exercise is destroying my lower back and I do not know why or how. Alternating jackknives really hurts to do.
Im finding it ver hard to do the step though planks. Does anyone have any tips

The jack knifes are the hardest. I can do multiple sets of the other exercises but not even a full set of these. I'm on day 5 and progressing. I'm doing around 10 reps before I give out, then carrying on by resting my heels on the floor for each alternating leg raise. If this position is like a supine plank, then here's my ab weakness. Day one of x sit up was hard but I've progressed to 3 sets now. Keep at it!
Fantastic routine- lets do 20 days of it!!!
There's someone dead in the back.
Best ab routine ever. Been doing it off and on for. ..about a year now I guess. ..great results. I'm going to start another 22 day  stint. ... best routine ever! O forgot, in my 60s. 6ft 210lbs 34 waist...yep I got a six pack.. almost an eight pack. .maybe by the end of this next iteration.

Before four months I was lifting 130kg weight and keeping it, pulled my straight shoulder... Now i am unable to do workout. Tell me what i should do?
Can we do this with our other routine exercises?
They should also give diet to be followed
Challenge accepted
Yeah, this fucked me
Alright, let’s how this will be going! Day 1: ☑️ (hard, but I got thru) UPDATE: Day 2: Got thru but am hurt from day 1 since my body isn't normally training, lol. Day 3: (Still hurt, but are able to do some practice forms) Day 4: (Am getting better now, and start to do some push ups aswell)
Would this work?
I had an injury and couldnt practice or do any kinds of activity for 6 months, i lost all my muscles and got really really round (i hate my genes)  So i decided to give it a try: Day 1: I'm shoked to find out that my abdominal muscles were totally gone and couldnt do good, but still i went through hell to finish it. Morning: OMG THIS PAIN IS UNBARIABLE, I MISSED THIS FEELING SOO MUCH. SEE YOU ON DAY 2 GUYS. Day 2: The muscle pain was so severe it hurted while standing still, the exercices felt a little bit better except the neddle thing, i thought im heavier than the moon. After completing the exercices my abs are legit wont working, it hurts so badly I cant do anything.
See what if take do this workout like  Morning some  Afternoon  Evening the rest of excercise  Cause it’s very hard for me do it all in once
Sir How many Set Should repeat ???
Hi, if I change the sequence, as below: 1st, heels to the heaven 2nd, step through planks 3rd, alternating Jackknifes  4th, Stationary bikes 5th, X man crunch 6th, alternating thread the needle  Because according to the original order, I can’t finish 45sec of alternating jackknifes & 30sec stationary bikes, so I pull them before X & needle. Is that ok? or any other advices? Thanks.
Sir my legs r too short and body is ok any suggest plz rply
Day 1 Done
Just today I finished this challenge And the change I went through is amazing. Thank you so much for your amazing videos.  Lots of motivation and information I get from them.
Imma not do planks, but can I count those pushups as planks
Really hard as hell :( Before training: A bowl of oats with nuts, almonds with chia and a cup of coffee After training: two boiled eggs/ Lentils / Boiled potatoes / Protein milkshake with bananas  Day 1 God, this is impossible! (75% of the entire exercises I did it correctly).  Day 2 All my body hurts, I had problems doing two exercises. I make two repetitions of heels of heaven since now (the only exercise I still have some energy to repeat it.  Day 3 I’m dying.... maybe and need to stop this or get a massage  :(  Complete it but some exercises I had to finished without enough strength  Day 4  Complete but I still had problems balancing my body with the 5th exercise. I feel less pain in my body after finish.  Day 5 I feel less pain on each exercise (except the 5th) I think that my body is recovering faster every exercise.  Day 6 Upper abs are growing! And I’m seeing the center line that is divide them more clear. No more pain in my body in the rest of the day, I just need to make more stretching exercises.  Day 7  Complete. 5th and 6th are the only exercises I still need strength to complete them correctly.  Day 8 Complete. Finally I’m making the 5th exercise without enough problems.  Day 9 Complete. Making two repetitions of 3rd exercise since now  Day 10 Complete.  Day 11 Omg where those abs came from ? Some edges are getting hard :D  Day 12  Complete  Day 13 Complete  Day 14 Complete  Day 15 Guys I recommend you to make every exercise  as exactly as possible, I’m seeing my obliques from the right side getting harder than the left side, still it works for me :)  Day 16 Complete  Day 17 Complete  Day 18 Complete  Day 19 Complete  Day 20 Wow I like how my upper abs are looking!  Day 21 Complete  Day 22 Complete  Still with few fluffy parts but is highly recommended! You are not gonna have a hard six pack if you haven’t made so much abs before, but your abs are gonna growing at least, I finally can take off my shirt on a pool without shame lol

Skinny fat beginner starting this plan with the aim to reduce belly size by 1-2 inches. Starting waist size: 35.5 inches  Day 1: Found it quite intense, was running outta break and had a stomach-churning feeling! i) 1x ii) 1x iii) 3 reps each only iv) 1x v) 1x (18 reps) Immediately after, Skipped roped for 134 reps consecutively for 1: 43 secs  Day 2: Was forced to do it just before sleep. Bad time to do this. Had very little motivation. i) 1x ii) 1x iii) 4 reps each only iv) 1x v) 1x (20 reps) jumped rope for consecutive 124 reps  Day 3:  i) 2x ii) 1x iii) 4 reps each only iv) 1x (started doing this the right way by not putting feet to the ground) v) 1x (14 reps) jumped rope for consecutive 110 reps and shadow-boxed for 2 mins.  Day 4: Completed. Day 5: Completed. Day 6: Completed. Day 7: Completed. Did it after a home back workout, one week complete, however, this isn't getting any easier! The upper set of abs is kinda visible currently! Day 8: Completed. Day 9: Done. In-between each exercise my mind keeps telling me to quit and asking me to do something else like watch Netflix or go out for a walk instead, however, I push through with the exercises anyway. Hopefully, this, in turn, will build me a stronger will power and the ability to push through with difficult tasks. Day 10: Done.

Day 7❌my injury from school almost healed(last night i could barely move,stand up kr sit down but i think ill be ready to start again after two days)
Does this workout target love handles as well?
i am going to try this 🔥
I just finished the last day. Thank you, Jeff, it was great.
Sir, i am 16 years old.. can do most of the exercises in the above video but not  able to do the stationary bike is there any alternative for that... thank you
Hi sir. Can I do it  empty stomach
Omg it's working! 😳
Loved it
What routine do I follow after 22 days?
What's the maintenance phase after 22 days?
Thank you sir... Plz make video on how to plan for cutting... How to loose fat without so much impact on weight....
I just wanna know when we should  run or for which we run?
Will this stop the height?
Abe salo Hindi bola kro
when you realizie that u lack of rear delts strengh for an ab workout...
Last two exercise are little bit tough..
But diet is the most important part for abs. What should i eat?
What can we say about Jeff. Genuinity in his words and workouts
Guys did you see results in 22 days??
Or you could pay for one of his programs and just use the 6 pack promise application. I like that app. Anybody on the fence about buying one of his programs? Do it. Takes the guess work out of your training program. And you can get your money back no questions asked if you get buyers remorse.
Am i doing it wrong? It wasn't my abs that were hurting it was my arms like my abs were fine but my arms gave out before my abs got tired, like for the step through planks and alternating thread the needle
Is top to down up is advisable to person having lumbar spine injury. Or all these exercises shown in this video will not have any impact on lumbar spine
Build a app for all of your exercise
Does this replace your ab excersize for the week? Or do you do the challenge on top of your ab training?
I bet he would get huge if he juiced up
No rest day in b/w sir .
Thanks so much for your good work out

How much sets for per excercise
Great for beginners like me. I enjoy doing this every day.
I don’t know how the f this got that many dislikes but whatever, haters won’t stop the grind
Started doing this from today. I actually thought about doing this 2 3 times before starting it but right now I can feel muscles in the core that I've never felt so I guess it's going to be once a day until this week, next Sunday I'll try to repeat it. This comment will be   updated every week.

Day1 - ☑️
Really nice workout 👌
can someone explain?? when i complate one exercise should i rest?
Man thanks a lot 👍
Day 1: completed   Day 2:completed
-Started the challange on Sep. 4. Let’s begin.
Edit: Just made it to day 15. One more week left of this challenge. My core muscles are more defined. Day 22, having completed it, I did see a difference in my body shape, more importantly I feel better, diligent and more persevering. It's worth doing this challenge.
Shouldn't there be at least 1 low back move in this workout to balance out the core?
can i do more than 6 exercises for abs like after doin these, can i try more exercises or something???
I'll give this a try:  Day 1: Did the first and last exercise twice, failed the jack knives.  Day 2: Did the first exercise twice and did the last exercise 4 times. Failed the jack knives.   Day 3: Did the last exercise 3 times, failed the jack knives.  Day 4: Failed knives.
Hey Jeff, Can I do this twice(morning & evening) a day as I'm a beginner of abs exercise and my body fat level is 20-25% on my belly area. Hope I get my answer....
I’m gonna do this . And I’ll update y’all on the results.
Every one knew this but no body can do this 😂
all right let’s do this day 1: done, I think I did the last exercise wrong, it was too easy. day 2: done, I am considering to add stuff, because it is really not that hard. my lower abs are weak, so I think I will add some things for them. day 3:
I need a personal trainer to hell at me
mastered my third day 😄
Day 0: Not sexy; decided to eliminate the two plank exercises and let's see how I'll fair after 22 days
I just want to know if all these exercises are flexor free or not? If not then I will have hard time doing these.
Bro you are pro✌✌
Are you supposed to start one exercise right after the other after failure on the previous? I tried this and was getting through 2 or 3 cycles for the first couple of exercises but by the end I was too fatigued to even make it through one cycle.
Some of these exercises I can do for 7 sets or more.. should I just increase the time?
I can describe you in just 1 word  awesome I can slightly see my abs
Is this for girls as well?
I have 28 days before school starts and hopefully this helps me get back in shape
Hell no
Is there a 10 second rest between each exercise too, or? It's weird.. I am on my 5th day, and I can do 150 secs on HttH, 150 secs on STP, 12+8 on X-man, 10+9 on the ATtN, only 45 secs on Jacknives and then about 100 secs on SB.... Why cannot I do more than 45 secs on Alternating jacknives..? I try, but it just says "stop"... Any advises?
How much rest should we be taking between the different exercises? I took only ten seconds on the first three days (just waited ten seconds after hitting extinction on the previous) but then jackknifes felt impossible to get to 45 on. Took closer to a minute today and felt I was able to benefit more from the latter two exercises
These exercises surely work. You’ll see some results after 21 days but if you want proper 6 abs do them for about 1 and a half months and add some more exercises
Im going to try this workout + added ab exercises at the end see what it does day one complited
Hey man i am 15 years old and my wait is 68 and i am a hardworker if you help me that give me some excersice but hard and effective please

Does anyone else find the thread the needle exercise considerably more time-consuming and physically demanding than the rest? I'm lazy but not asking from a perspective of laziness. I'm happy to do the work but feel this set almost doesn't fit with the others.

Fast chest grouth video Sand me bro please fast

How much rest in between exercises? I know it's 10 seconds between rounds of the same exercise, but how much rest between one exercise and the next?
Day 1 - complete     Abs hurt but it's manageable
Hindi mai sir
3:17 how do u do this without pulling your groin ?! I would like to know ? Do u regularly stretch?
Is this excercise only for men or can be female workout? Sorry I don’t know if ok
Guys i hope you are reading this,i am 17 years old skinny boy i dont have any muscle and will try this i will update this every day and tell you the result(I am not expecting a miracle,but i will try my best GL to you all)
I did this long time now I have 3 pack
extinction style training sounds like its going to kill me!
Started: Aug 12 Day 1:Sore Day 2:Same results ( 4 pack abs visible) Day 3: it got more visible but I have to flex it Day 4: Doing more intense workouts Day5: Complete
I'm gonna start today.
Alrighty let's get this started. I'm going to log everything here:   Day 1- pushed, but really could've been better   Day 2- little bit sore from day 1, pushed as hard as I could, can feel the doms comin' in   Day 3- forgot to edit, not as sore as day 2 for some reason, maybe it's because my biceps are more sore and that's distracting me   Day 4 okok flunked this one, super tired already from badminton, cardio etc. Ended up doing like 12:40 so like not even day 4 😭 and this was the worst performance yet   Day5- gooooott a little bit lazy and got killed by jack knives  DAY 6- YIIIIIIKKKKEESSSS I DID HALF AND WAS TOO TIRED I EILL DO IT TWICE THE NEXT DAY TO MAKE IT UP
Bro the man problem for me here is that I was able to do this perfectly at the first and the second day but after that your ribs and body parts pain this much that you are not able to do this again at the third day what should I do bro this is my third day I think I should take one day break so that my muscles will  recover what do u think...???
Starting this tomorrow
It will work! 100%  but you should stick to your diet
Alright I finished it. That being said, listen to this: The workout only works if you push yourself to extinction!! Keep pushing your mind and body. Secondly, you aren’t going to get abs like this dude. He does abs that are also paired with good cardio and good diet. The key to clean cut abs is diet. You have to eat well for the ab workout to burn fat. Lastly, I’m taking a break because no one works any other muscle for 22 days straight so why are abs any different! Besides this challenge, you should take at least a day rest to recover.
Can everyone get an 8 pack? Or is it only genetics? Or with hard work can everyone get it?
Just started let see if I make it Day 1: holy fuck (I made it tho I had to take a lot of breaks in between)
I am hypnotised by this guy's pecs
What If your posture is incorrect. Can you still do these exercises?
Laro 22 days
Can I go longer than 22 days or will it damage my body?
Yu are the best ❤️
Ima copy nd all.   Tuesday  August 13 12:03Am Day 1✅:  I struggled with a few exercises when I was all done I repeated the first one also I am doubting if I'm doing them right I haven't felt s burn in my abs only in my arms it felt a burn a few times tho(on my abs). I'll keep going
this guy is so helpful!!!!
Okay this should be fun... Day 1: Why did I decide to do this in my underwear? Day 2: Running 4 miles didn't help. I barely finished it.
Why does he talk SOOOOO much? He could cut every video in half and we would learn the same amount.
I’m doing this and I’m 13 days in and I I’m starting to see my obliques,I finished the 22 days
I’ve been trying to follow this since December but haven’t been focused. Now I’m doing it! I’m 16 Weight: 145lbs. Day 1: Complete (struggled with jack knives. Ended up doing two sets of 25)  Day 2: Complete😫 (I did 2 sets for the first one, the rest I did one of. Jack knives suck.)  Day 3: Complete (I went out for a 20 minute jog so came home tired. This just means I did less sets.)  Day 4: Complete (I lost a day. I’m out vacationing with the fam, I don’t have much down time to focus, but I’m trying.)
Get ur kidneys check done. U look pathetic.
This is my favorite out of all your ab workouts. Thanks Jeff! Appreciate this channel :D
this is smthg extraordinary, thanks a lot!
Do you have any student-friendly suggestions for working out. I don't wanna mess up my studies nor my body.
do i need rest days?
That's one hot body in the the thumb.  🔥🔥👀😯👉👈
I think I did this all wrong... I spent almost 15 minutes on the first excercise and i was so sweaty and exhausted i couldn't even complete on rep off the others
So you don’t have to give abs time to grow ?
I didn’t know athlean x did abs
U r right. No one can escape from an easy workout

Day2: way more difficult considering i was sore but pain makes me work harder.  Day3: the hardest day so far, body is really sore i can’t even put a shirt on lmao.  Day 4: tripled everything tryna get my body more used to this but i’m still pre sore.
I find the last exercise much easier than the other ones? Why is it only 30seconds? Or am I doing something wrong..
What are the resting times between each exercise ?
Day 1.second attempt at doing day 1...

Hey, I've been watching your videos for quite some time now. They have served me quite well. For abs, you've created another video- The perfect Abs, from the The perfect workout series. I'd like to know which video content would you suggest for better results on abs ?
6.1 k fat bitches.
when I do the first exercise, a click occurs in the spine. it doesn’t hurt, it’s just an unpleasant sound. I do everything right and breathe and strain what is wrong?
Did it work
How many time a day can you do this? I'm thinking of doing it twice a day
Wait I need some help understanding Extinction. Okay so I just did the first exercise, Heels to heavens, 5 times. That can't be right. But I made it through the 45 seconds and took 10 second breaks in between. Help?
The thing is I've seen people documenting their experience but I'm thinking y'all only do this shit once huh, but I've done this and I'm pretty fit and do excersize often and I keep going until I can't and this shit is hard after the third one I can't do the needle excersize that shit hurts I've done the first three like 3-6 times idk are people doing it like me or nah???? Cuz then it would make sense how y'all are getting through all of this  Only do the excersizes once not the days
I go on holiday in 40 days, trying to get abs, will be doing this everyday will update this comment each day to let you guys know if this works  Day 22: Ok I have been doing this but forgot I commented   I have noticed the top 4 abs coming through and I have been able to do more sets and reps This is a good workout and I’ll let you guys know on day 40 if I’ve got the full abs
After doing ab workouts do you need to eat protein?
Wanted to ask if u can train ur abs everyday? I’ve heard u should give ur abs a break just like every other muscle in ur body
The X-Man looks like Spongebob doing Photosynthesis
Hi. I found this challenge and I want to definitely give it a try, but I have a question though. How many reps should we aim for this session? Thanks!
Hi, Jeff. Awesome intro to the 22-day workout. But the one thing I'm not clear on is how do you add to it, do you add to each another set per week?
my 6 pack abs are all due to this program. thanks a lot sir
It’s mostly proper diet. This will get you strong abs and it’s been working; however, if you really want to see the results, you need a better diet.
i should post before and after pictures to let yall know if it works
Day: 1, decided to say "Fuck it." due to YouTube recommendations.  It was a lot more intense than I was expecting.  Gonna be doing another run through of this in a few hours.
Holy shit that guy in the back fucking died
Full body workout follow along?
I really wonder if it is possible to get that body with just exercising, no dietry and protein, just exercise.
how about sex?..
Can we do this along side weight lifting exercise?
Boe
No beat
i can't understand what are those dislikes for... amazing as always
the best coach & the best physic ever!!!! When passion and hard work pays off. Thank you Jeff for the brilliant tips!!!!
day 1: it was pretty hard, i hate the alternating jackknives day 2: abs are now pretty sore day 3: abs hurt even more but getting use to it day 4: abs hurt still, but the pain is not a big deal also seeing changes just a 2 pack so far day 5: same results day 6: im flying thru this(abs hurt but getting used to it) day 7: same results day 8: same results day 9: abs hurt day 10: same results day 11: i see a four pack but its not that noticeable day 12: same results day 13:same results< i did it 3 times for a challange day 14 same results day 15: im flying thru this even faster day 16:same results but 5 days left! day 17:same results,  need more support day 18: same results day 19: 3 more days! day 20: 2 more days lets go day 21: 1 more day day 22: its not a complete 6 pack still have a layer of fat but did lose weight, to really get a six pack you would have to go on a diet i got a 4 pack
This seems brutal
Day 3... it’s funny how the stronger you get the longer and more suck happens with this extinction shit😂
I think abs are just like other part of body....thy also need recovery time.... consistently for 22 days seems strange
Did no one finish this and remembered to post update? Lol. Guess I'll take one for the team  DAY 1- finished. Realized how fat I am now haha. Hurts so good though.
Those jackknifes are fucking crazy
3 days ago
Can I train with you please reply
Hate that thread the needle exercise 😤
Day 2 BOIIII
Sir , want ask you why do i get spasms when i do abs exercise.
I will begin today, i will be editing to let you know every day what will happen.
I’m a D1 athlete and this wasn’t easy😂
Can u implement this with your normal workouts? Push/pull then abs in the end?
I am starting it today, wish me good luck,I will keep you updated every single day!!!!
I really hope this works.....I've downloaded a lot of ab workout AoS and tried the exercises for a month and I barely saw any change
I keep losing balance during x-man crunch and jackknifes, how do I fix it
Ok here we go Day 1 :
Love this

Hi! I’m Alba from mexico, I’m really surprised how do you look and of course you profesional work, but I really concern about the pelvic flour. How do you recommend to take care of?
Easy dub easy claps Day one:meh Day two:🤣 Day three : I was sore but felt six pack Day four : I felt I like I blacked out during experiment
What do you eat during this workout
Great workout for sure!💪🏼👌🏼
He do3snt even have a belly button this shiz fake
Day 1 : Had some troubles with 2nd exercise and 4th.. FYI I am adding 50 normal crunches as compensation for the exercises I have trouble with other then that did about 2 - 3 sets for each other exercises... will try to keep updating Day 2 : completed.. already starting to see a small difference... added 75 crunches Day 3 : woudnt call this abs but very small lines are making an appearance
Beginner here but always had strong abs, I'm OK getting through them for the duration but those Jack knifes kill me  literally struggle to get a few out.. Next exercise, the last is fine... Jack knives is a killer?
22 days bicep workout? with dumbbells only?
Would u train me?
For those wondering, yes this does work. I was skinny and had barely visible abs, pretty much nothing, but now people have told me my abs look way more defined, etc. Make sure you do each exercise with technique, not speed. After 22 days, I stopped doing this workout, and moved on to doing this much harder and advanced workout everyday.  2x Reverse crunch (60 sec) Air sprint (40 sec) Leg lift (45 sec) Mountain climber (45 sec)  2x Reverse corkscrews (45 seconds) Floor wipes (35 seconds) Weighted oblique twists (15lb) (35 sec)  2x toe touch (10 reps) cross leg crunch (20 reps) X man crunch (12 reps) Stationary bike (35 sec) Weighted crunches (12 reps) (15lb)
Did he say Little and replaced it with current I'm yujiro Hanma fool.
I'm going Aloha in 22 days, so starting tonight I'll do this every day. I'll update every day to let you know if it really works. note: i am starting with beginner...
I thought that were easy but when I did that it's far tough that I thought
bus biceps look like biscuits in the thumbnail
Thanks for making the video. I need to work on my abs, and I will try out some of these.
I feel like any one would say I'm to yound for this
To everyone who sees this, I’m starting today and writing down the results here so that we all can see it this works or not :) Day 1: my abs hurt s little but my elbows are sore as fuck from the tiles I was on, don’t use a hard surface :) Day 2: I feel sore af but it’s not that bad Day 3: I don’t feel as bad as yesterday, but I’m still a little sore Day 4:

Great shit love this shit we need a video for chest
Why does my neck hurt as Well
Tried it yesterday.  Went to the gym wearing tights and no shirt. They made me leave. What did I do wrong?
I get to the jackknife and stationary bike and can’t do like any
Can you please discuss about the shoulder workout and some effective triceps workout
Is good to workout!
Jackknives are the toughest
Mathew McConaughey?
Starting today : Pretty Hard (I’ll edit this on day 22!)  Finish : Went great! Saw improvements in endurance, visually, and mentally. It definitely helped me prepare for marching band and have a new desire for working out!

Who else is a 13 year old 5’4 120lbs kid who is skinny fat?
5 rds every day no more no less
Been doing this almost a week now and all I can say is wow. I've gained more tone in a week doing this than months of what I had been doing. Thank you
Fucking video
Started doing this a week ago and still struggling to make it all the way through. I’m exhausted by the time I get to the Alternating Jacknives. Thanks for the free self torture Jeff!
I'm starting this does it actually work
I'm starting it. 17 years old, male. 5'5 ft. 66.5 kg. No abs. Square as a table hehehe.
In another video he said "to have two packs you need to control your diet,for 4 packs you need to have a good diet and for six packs you need to take an excellent diet". Remember 60% body is built in the kitchen,I mean it depends on what you eat. Going to start this challenge from tomorrow,tho I already have two packs,lets see of it helps me with gaining lower four packs or not .that's the body area which has the most stubborn fat😒.wish me luck and need prayers😜
these exercises everyday?
oh boy cant wait to go to bed in a few seconds and wake up feeling like i got my ass handed to me by five guys
From all of thoes the only one i had major issues is the jackknives, i have no cordination, and i can't currently rise to do the cross arms, for the rest i could do 1-2 sets before fealing like a sack of potatoes but it is a nice surprise to see how bad or good one is doing.
Going to start tomorrow and edit my comment to update you guys everyday! Wish me luck and use this as a motivation! ————————————————————————— Day 1: Did everything, some sets I did more extinctions then others, overall every set gives you a pretty good burn. I’m already an athletic kid and I’m skinny but I don’t have abs . After today, lines are already forming. Make sure you guys are drinking plenty of water and not overeating/eating tons of junk.  I’ll be back tomorrow!!
Yeah i like this hard exersice    because some one says (no pain no gain)
Trying this because I’m tired of being complacent with how I look and feel. I’ll edit and give some updates throughout the next 3 weeks. Thanks for the support.   Day 1: Made it through 2 extinctions of heels to heaven pretty easily but struggled with the exercises after that, probably from the fatigue. By the bicycles I couldn’t even lift my shoulders off of the ground. Stomach is very sore and almost feels numb. Day 2: I got 2 sets of heels to heaven again barely. Got through almost one set of all of the other exercises until I got to stationary bike again. I just can’t get my abs to lift my shoulders off the ground. Hopefully I’ll be able to get at least 15 seconds of stationary bike soon. Thanks everyone! Day 3: completed about half of the bicycles today!! Felt a good burn and feel like I’m getting stronger. Day 4: made it through 3 sets of heels to heaven and 2 sets of x-men crunches!! Felt great until I got to stationary bike again. Keep struggling with that one. Day 5: Got basically the same results as yesterday but was able to do about 20 seconds of the stationary bike. Following that I did 30 seconds of Russian twists to make up for some of the sets that I couldn’t finish. I feel good but I’m pretty sore today. Day 6: same as 5 but got almost done with bike!! Day 7: week one is complete!! Day 8: powered through today. Didn’t really want to but anything to get better! Day 9: ate like crap today and I could definitely tell when I did this workout. I felt like I didn’t have any energy. Need to get my diet on track. Day 10: done  I was on vacation and missed the day 11 workout. Back on it again today though.  Day 11: back at it and it went well today. Might have helped to have a day off to recover.
So I can work my Abs ever day
my mans is ripped
Thanks
Might as well start this... wish me luck
Give tip for teen workout at home plzzz
ppl think they will be looking like him after 22 days but reality is you'll still be looking like a stick after the 22 days.. just with a visible six pack.
For a beginner would it be effective to start with a 30 sec extinction time and half the reps? That would allow me to get I two sets almost. And once I can do three or maybe four sets go back to the original extinction times and rep counts?
Gonna start these today for 22 days gonna keep you all updated  My routine : Stay below 1000 calorie Gym for 1:30 hrs  Running for 15 mins and this shit
Imma start this tomorrow I’ll try and post updates on here (I’m writing this so I actually do it)  Day 1: I decided to start today instead of tomorrow but I’m somewhat sore and I had to modify the jackknives a bit bc I’m weak (,: I also finished my workout with a 20 second plank (gotta get ready for band camp) while doing this I’m using the running app and doing the workouts. (It has a white background with a pinkish fire thing if you’re interested in it)  Day 2: alright I know it says no rest but i was so dead yesterday. I didn’t run today but the workout is still challenging and I’m still substituting the jackknives and finished with a 30 sec plank
Is the extinction after each exercise or do you go through them all then start again?
How does this giy look so chill when he’s doing it. Legit I’m out here gasping for air after the first set😂😂
I look so much better thank u so much jeff
Starting this today... wish me luck!
Back to the cheeseburgers 🍔
I did this exercise right, it hurts when I do it to failure. I did the exercise but afterwards my ab area doesn’t hurt. Is it because there is fat around my abs or something? I’m confused because I’ve done a hand full of ab exercises but none hurt. They only rarely hurt a little bit the next day.
Ok 👌🏻 iam starting tomorrow!!!!!
Jeff these are killing your gains...
Maybe I’m doing wrong but every time I do the first exercise it absolutely kills my triceps
having a rough time with alternating jackknives, can do 2 sets+ of all the other before extinction but cant get this one, is it my balance or just weak upper abs?
U r the Bset, Jeff.  I m gonna try this, promise, gotta get rid of my fat belly, dammit! Keep posting, bro. Good luck
thank you Jeff
Excellent exercise I'll make use of them
I didn't get it?? If I do 45 second then I do it again?? Can anyone help me understand it??
3:20: "Fuuuuuuuutureeeeeee"
If I am doing weight training daily so how to add this in my workout routine? may I do once in a week?
The comments section looks promising so I'm going to give it a try too. I'll try to update every day. Good luck.❤ Day 1: It hurt in the beginning but the pain subsided as I continued. The profuse sweating was a good sign of it's effectiveness though. I did 3 reps for 1st,2nd,4th,5th exercises and for 3rd and 6th exercise I did 5 reps. Day 2:I was rather lazy and tired so I skipped. 😅😂 Day 3:The body sore was so intense that I could barely move but I managed to complete it. 😭 Day 4:Lazy but done. No change yet. Day 5:Skipped😅 Day 6:Done Day 7:No changes. I think I got fatter? T_T Day 8:Done.Btw I noticed that the upper part of the stomach (abs section)  sweats while the lower part doesn't really sweat. Day 9:Done Day 10:Done.My belly which felt like jelly is starting to get hard. Day 11:Done Day 12:Done So, I did not update for the rest of the days because I did not complete 22 days. However, I did this with a little bit of running and some other exercises. And voila my waist went down about two inches I think. I also lost a lot of weight from my thigs, back and arms. That's why I recommend this highly incase you want to lose weight and gain abs. Good luck. ❤
Let's start the 22 days workout :  ✅day 1 : okay but i'm not able to do the alternatives jackknives ✅day 2: again i finished the daily workout but damn this should be renamed sweat generator ! ✅ forgot to check workout day 3 as completed. Nice but i just figured out before the day 4 workout that i was doing the exercices the wrong way, espacially alternating jackknives. Let's begin the day 4 workout ✅day 4 : done ! ✅day 5 completes but with a lot of difficulties due to an intense lower body workout ✅day 6: might be the best workout of 6 days ✅day 7: completed ✅day 8: no workout due to a canoe day ✅day 9: good workout  ✅day 10 : ok ✅day 11 : ok ✅day 12 : ok ✅day 13 : tried max Lsit hold and lasted 17seconds  Also thanks for the support 💪
None of them look like for beginners. especially X Man Crunch.  I quit watching!  If only I could do 1 full set of all the 4......here comes the towel...  😒
How long did u guys take per workout?
You speak always way to much and long. Reduce please
Sounds neat. with what intensity or exervises should i train my lower back to keep up with my abs?
Instead than 22 days just do this everyday honestly
Day 1 - Complete✅ Didn’t get to any extinctions, really struggled, bad form, out of breath. (No abs yet...What?!) Looking forward to tomorrow.  Day 2 - Complete✅ Just got in from work and I started the gym this week, second day today, leg day... So by the time I got in tonight I was exhausted but that’s just an excuse so I forced myself to do it. Felt like my form slightly improved and was less breathless, jack knives were especially tough again, didn’t get past extinction again because I was more focused on form then reps (felt like if I carried on they wouldn’t have been proper reps) Abs burning, overall a slight improvement, looking forward to tomorrow!
Im gonna try this
My journey begins.... I will be updating this This is a small edit I’m making, I felt the need to say that at the start of this, I’m at a 15.9 % body fat percentage and can only see my upper abs. Hoping this video can bring down body fat and make lower abs visible. I’m not doing anything dramatic to me diet just picking smarter and trying to get more protein, nothing serious.  Also thanks for the likes, it’s encouraging.  Day 1: complete. Sore but ok Day 2: I. Want. To. Die other then that I’m doing good Day 3: feeling a bit better and also really pushing my limits on reps and time. I’ve noticed that before doing this my sleep schedule was terrible but now i can sleep much better and easier. Day 4: feeling alot better
So im gonna also post my progress in the comments like a lot of other people have been doin Keep in mind that i am not a beginner and i have a pretty good physique  I go to the gym everyday as well and i eat very clean Ima start this tmr
Doing this during my school holidays!! I’ll be back In 2 days!
Started today will add updates later Day 1:body is very sore i needed a lot of water Day 2: still sore from yesterday but still did it Day 3: feeling better i lasted longer but i feel like i did something wrong its not feeling the same Day 4:yeah i  probably did something wrong yesterday i felt it today i was able to do 2 sets of the sit through planks but the threaded needles kicked my ass Day 5: abs are killing me but i must keep going Day 6:nothing new just completed Day 7:im starting to feel it in my back now
I will start from today n will update my progress .....already running n push ups from last 30 days so stay tuned will update every single day.... Thanks alot for real help sir... Love from India..... DJHITMAN HERE
If u r a trainer as you are right now! How do u offer money for ur body? What business do u run? What do u work sir?
Day 2 done
Can this get rid of belly fat??
I just want to ask , is it okay if I do this workout everyday?
Best video ...
NO REST!  Literally says 10 seconds rest between every 45 second extension time
I love all the people commenting there progress and saying “day 3 already noticing a four pack coming in”. Your not going to notice physical change like that in 3 days
1:55
If I start on day 22 and I turn it around will I go fat again?
Anyone wants to make a group chat and report their progress?. More motivating
day one couldn't finish a single excersise
Video starts at 1:49
My balance is shit
I can’t keep my forearms on the ground for the step throughs 😩  Update: I realized I wasn’t using my hips enough so now I can keep them down.
Day 2
For second there I thought he meant working out for 22days straight no rest😂
When my girlfriend says that I come too quickly I say that I'm doing a 45 seconds extinction time
Definitely gonna try this thank you
Day 1 done
I made it to the Superman on my first try😓😓😓its really hard😩😅😅😅✌🏾
I will start today and I will give the result after 22 days 💪🏾I will do it 100% ❤💪🏾
Thank you sar
Wow! This looks tough! Great job💪
Day 2 ab challenge.  Very sore. I look forward to it.
Yes you are right i have abs in 22 days
Your abs look like balloons
Thread the needle was the hardest by far
Day one 👍
😂 you don’t have abs underneath your belly button I do 😂👌
Me : works out abs at the gym today Youtube recommendation: 22 day ab workout
His fucking muscles have muscles
That last exercise is hard as hell
Why is my neck always straining when I do these?
Why the fuck are people so damn stuck on there selfs. Fitness people are a bit insane I feel. What ever floats your boat tho. I'm good with all natural physic and natural muscle tone. Just listening to this guy has me exhusted.
I needa impress the girl i have a crush on tbh
Commenting on day 2 but... Day 1: Completed, abs hurt way more than i thought but excited to continue doing this.  Day 2: Completed, abs still hurt a lot, but I feel like I had better form on the exercises than I did on day 1
This is the stupidest clip ever Like he got those abss in that time ...  Yea right
Sorry, how many reps for one exercise? Example: let say I finish exercise (1), so move to next exercise or do again exercise (1) until I cannot do? Please guide me.
He got me at "nothing worth having should come easy". I've never really been able to keep up for a fixed number of days. Here's hoping posting it on here motivates me to continue this for 22 days and beyond. Day 1 - Done
Started today , I’ll update my progress day by day.   Wish me luck 😭😭 - - - - - - - - - - Day 1: Completed, but my abs feel heavy. Did at least 2 sets of most of them
So fake
love it going to hate it but I want to try it that kind of ripped deserves all the attention
Can you do these steps if you have sciatica ?
"Nothing worth having should come easy"
here we go. starting june 23rd.  Day 1: was able to do two rounds of two of the workouts, and still working on perfecting them. baby abs barely showing.  Day 2: i was a little sore today. i managed to do two sets (extinctions) of three of the exercises. i struggled with the X man crunch - the hardest one for me. not too many changes ab-wise yet. day three should be good.  Day three: good! i was sore but improved each exercise and had more extinctions SLIGHTLY.  Day 4: pretty hard, actually. was a little sore still, but basically the same as day three. a little faster doing the second workout.  Day 5: some improvement! staying on time with doing these each day. three extinctions for the jackknifes, other exercises stayed similar. i’m a little more efficient. abs about the same.  Day 6: abs starting to form? baby abs. lighting is also dependent but not as much. workouts went nicely, three extinctions for the jackknifes. a record.  Day 7: (late update) went well, i’m improving all around for sure. each exercise is most certainly hard but i’m getting more out of it.  Day 8: harder than yesterday. i was tired and am, which i think was contributing. still completed the workout. no ab changes.
My air bag need 2 years workout
I want to know EXACTLY what his body fat percentage is. It’s gotta be like 6%. Maybe even less.
I want to know EXACTLY what his body fat percentage is. It’s gotta be like 6%. Maybe even less.
I usto be fat but now I  have a six pack
Im going to start this tm and let yall know if this work
this channel really does go underrated
Your biggest problem is you talk a lot n show workout less,it makes your videos boring 🤷🏻‍♂️
I’m so excited to do this , wish me luck boys!
Jesus, I cant even do some of these exercises
Melania isn't giving me any coochie so I thought this might help
Just doing this to hold myself accountable: Day 1: completed barely one extinction of each. ( my abs were so sore after this) Day 2: completed. (Surprisingly not too sore after this time)
Challenge accepted; day 0
Day 1. Will be updating every day. I freaking died at the jack knife. I did two of each up til then and I couldn't go any further. The Jack Knife is my killer everything else was fine. Will have to work on it. The stationary bike okay too got one full set through and made it to 15 seconds. Gah my calfs and stomach hurts. Day 2: did it after a workout and I was dead after couldn't reach one set of any.
Jan22
Looks like the most suitable home workout for me. Gonna start doing it today. I will talk about the results down here. Day 1 - Felt the burn and got very fucking sweaty, like i just ran 5km. Day 2 -  Day 3 - Day 4-  Day 5 -  Day 6 -  Day 7 -  Day 8 - Day 9 -  Day 10 -  Day 11 -  Day 12 -  Day 13 -  Day 14 -  Day 15 - Day 16 -  Day 17 - Day 18 - Day 19 -  Day 20 - Day 21 - Day 22 -
How much time between exercises though?
It looks like if you shot him, the bullet would just bounce off like nothing
Question i recently started going back to the gym after a big break and started doing a 5x5 (5 sets of 5 reps) workout plan with the basics.  Can i add this on at the end or would it be to much?
Good give this world.
Ive gotten to the point where it foesnt hurt but i think if it doesnt hurt it isnt doing anything, i wonder if im doing something wrong
Chuck Norris did this and got 18 pack abs. He was dissatisfied.
Legend says the guy in the back skipped obliques in Jeff’s gym
Hu ok I'll do this 🤨
I thought it was bad to train your abs every day?
You can tell jeff isn’t necessarily the life of the party but man, I got respect for this guy.
Honestly this is way to hard lmao I’m at intermediate and I’m slipping around and I can’t balance very well. My core strength isn’t the problem but my form is just shit on all of these. I know someone is gonna say it’s cuz my strength already but I just can’t grip the floor or balance very well
I started this today, if there’s a way I’ll post my results after.
Fingers crossed I can keep consistent and not pussy out. Day 1: feel pressure in abs and I failed to get past the first set on at least half of the exercises. (especially towards the end)
His finger looks like a rectangle in the thumbnail
Anyone else looking through the comments to see if it worked out
how you got so shredded?
What should be my BMI to get abs on the 22nd day?
"Nothing worth having comes easy.."  <3
Hey can anybody help me with my situation, whenever I do heals to the heaven my right hip feels like it's gonna get dislocated.
so after 22 days ..what are gona do? 3 times a week or?
You don’t look.... healthy..
I hate that your videos pop up as recommended for me.  You seem like such a tool. Put a shirt on for fook sake
How to maintain our food during the 22 days
22 day 😂😂😂😂😂
How many rounds off all 6?
I love his exercise 😍😍😍 Thanks for giving me a good exercise
I do not want to look like this guy. His body is built but it’s disgusting
day one complete already dead😂 21 more to go
If your trying to get lean with your regular workout routine is it low weight high reps?
Well it actually take 66 days to create a new habit 🤔
Don’t you need to let your muscles rest?
How many times a day?
I’m going to record my process through this , I will report back in 22 days exactly , I weigh about 166 and I have a little bit of fat but not much , let’s see what I can do and I go to the gym 2-3 times a week so that will factor into this
I lost count on the days so I’m just gonna keep going😂 I went from extinction and time limit to reps because then it would be easier to do it on the spot and not have as much preparation. My abs are looking so much better!
*Quality Content* people who criticize jeff *yall go to hell*
Jeff is basically real life Goku
Going to try this. Good stuff
whats the best time to hit those abs? I mean after my strength training or anytime in the day
Do we have breaks if we do how many seconds???
steroids+dehydration
What if you got a gut already?
Shut up
Is there a video out about why abdominal muscles atrophy so quickly?  What I mean is, when I go a while without working biceps or chest, I am weaker but I still have some capacity: however, with abs, it's as if I have literally done an ab workout in my life.  Why is that?
Has anyone on keto diet did this and had decent results even with a different eating style?
Posting progress starting later today so rn it’s 4:00 am and I’ll cal it day 0 until I start later (current body: 6’1” 15 yr old 204 pounds)
Ok seriosuly. What do you mean by rep
Starting this tomorrow morning. Thank you
Im planning to start this workout plan
New sub
In 22 days we get 6packs?
I've been doing this everyday and i overtrain my abs too much. I also advocate overtraining because what it does is to force itself from breaking the muscle fibers in order to increase the recovery.
Day one ✅  Day two ✅ Day three✅ Day four ✅  Day five ✅  Day six ✅  Day seven ✅  Day eight  ✅ Day nine ✅  Day ten ✅ Day 11 ✅  Day 12 ✅ Day 13 ✅  Day 14 ✅  Day 15 ✅ Day 16 ✅  Day 17 ✅  Day 18 ✅  Day 19 ✅  Day 20 ✅ Day 21 ✅ Day 22 ✅
So no winning , really ?
Everyone in the comments hit this like button if you did the workout because that will get me going on this workout
Saved this 2 weeks ago. Finally got up and did my first day. Didn’t make it all the way through most, but it’s a start. Day 2: it was hell but I completed at least 1 round of all exercises. Day 3: Sore throughout the day, nonetheless completed. Day 4: Completed (Was hurting halfway through it) Day 5:  Completed (Forgot to update) Day 6: Completed Day 7: Completed (Long week)
My back aches from this
What ever lmao ,,most these pot bellied mfers todays cant DP this for one minute bahahaha let alone for 21 days lmao ,bahahaha adaptable lol ,well unless they stop eating like a horse and drinking a 15 pack everyday this video is just wasting their time ,bahahahaha just saying ,the truth is the truth regardless who's feelings get hurt ,honesty is the best thing for everyone period  ,lies and excuses are why people are so lazy and over weight and or out of shape (skinny and weak ) and that is just the truth and I'm truly sory if it hurts ,that's said you'll be better for it in the end if ,once you realize I'm right ...
I'm going follow this stuff thanks  bro
I can’t even do half of these. Anyone else?
I'm batman!
So if u can only do each exercise once say the 1st exercise u can only do for 45 seconds do u take a 10second break then go onto the 2nd exercise? Or do u go straight from 1st exercise to the 2nd
What am I doing wrong second workout I feel burn In my arms and legs not anywhere in my torso
I got a 6 pack
U look like a ripped Brock Obama
Day 1 ✅
Ok I honestly think my body fat percentage is less then 5% because I am extremely skinny and after just a week I literally have a 4 pack that is clearly visible
Brooo is that hulk
No rest? Not realistic.
why do his abs here look like a face? 3:35
Just started the workout today, and I got in 2.5 reps for each one except the jackknife. I think that’s decent enough for a 14 year old... Aiming for 4 of each at 22 days. 💪🏽
I like this dude cause he seems like a genuine trainer and not some "Bro"
day 1 ❗️
Abs🤔  Not popular in our gym  Is it the ...  Dirty gym floors beneath their $300.00  workout gear?  Difficulty ?  Too many consuming buffalo wings and guzzling pink shaker mixes and wondering why ab definition is MIA?  Convinced abs represent a minimum of  4-5 days per week with an expanded and varied list of exercises  No shortcuts to an impressive and stable core...
Day 7
These exercises are hard to do for beginners 😣
Why the frick do I keep getting this ad
I wish there was a “I don’t like this but I like this” button!  Getting a little better every day but it still hurts.... one day I am hoping my flab turns into fab!
Thank you
I’ve been neglecting my core for months and this workout knocked me out day 1. Excited to see how the other 21 days go
I just did this ab workout and it kicked my ass...literally ! I can't wait until day 22. Keep up the amazing exercise advice Jeff Cavaliere and thank u so much for helping those who wish to get back into shape.
Jeff, can you do an update to this video but instead make a daily "full core" group of exercises? Something that targets the complete, 360-degree athletic core and can still be done daily?
Did it for 3 days now, first two days were really hard I couldnt complete most of it specially the Stationary bike. Third day was a bit Okay did the whole thing properly.  No abs are popping at the moment but I feel the mid range has got harder.
LMAO IMMA TRY DO THIS I WILL REPORT BACK EACH DAY Day 1:not bad but my legs and abs are on 🔥🔥 Day 2:starting to feel less pain but still on 🔥🔥 Day 3:starting to feel something at my abs and able to do the task easier Day 4:done and I'm tired lmao Day 5:easily completed it Day 6:lost like 1 kg in like almost a week 🙀👏👏 Day 7:can see a line that forms the abs more clearly Day 8:done 👌 Day 9:smashed it Day 10:I've developed a 4 pack!it's easier to see it now 👌 Day 11:done 👌 Day 12:nailed it
Do I have to do the first exercise 45 seconds and if I can't make it switch to the next exercise right?
Maybe if I wasn't as obese as I am maybe I could at leat do half of these
Is this for any age to do?
2:15 God obliques
This nigga always has his shirt off
Dude thank you, this work out if done properly, its the shit. Ma new life style..lol
It's raining for the next few days so I will start this next week.
I can’t seem to do the jackknifes is there an alternative or just keep doing it I’ll I’m able to do it
So I mean if you’re fat like me I guess this will make you thin and then if I keep going it will eventually get me abs I say this because it seems like everyone doing this that says it works are already skinny
how much rest should you have between each exercise?
Hell no.
Imma start it.Ill update on the progress and take pics as i go on.I eat really healthy and workout and run.Lets see if that helps!😬
Hey anyone how many times a day u do the workout? I am doing one full in the morning and with energy that's left in the night about before sleep and i fell amaizing abs hurt yes but no pain no gain
Trying this. Day 1 ouf, it is hard. barely got through level 1 for each exercise, but determined to try this for a month hopefully see progress.
I'll be doing this workout later this morning. I found the video today on June 6th 2019.
👽👽👽👽👽👽
I faced problems in the jacknives. Couldn't keep the right posture. I have posterior tilt in my back. Could that be a reason?
June 28, 2019
My old comment got deleted, but that’s not gonna stop me😉  I would really appreciate it if you like this comment, so I know that someone is following my progress😊  I’m going to the beach with my crush this summer, and I really wanna impress her, so that’s why I’m doing this challenge. (And to get stronger)🤞  Day 1: ✅ Day 2: ✅ Day 3: ✅ Day 4: ✅ Day 5: ✅ Day 6: ✅ Day 7: ✅ Day 8: ✅ Day 9: ✅ Day 10: ❌ Day 11: ❌ Day 12: ✅ Day 13: ❌
Am  Beginner and this was hard especially that plank bicycle thing
what is your body fat percentage?
Started yesterday but i wanted to show progress: Day 1: I completed it ,somewhat painful. Day 2: Abs are sooo sore, barely completed the workout (abs feel more strongerr) Day 3: Completed it ,I feel way more stronger than before . I still got a little bit of soreness but the pain feels good. Day 4 : ✅ Day 5: ✅ Day6: Couldn’t complete because it was my brothers birthday. Day 7: ✅ Day 8: ✅
i love you
even his face muscles are jacked
Day 1: Done (a little challenging) Day 2: Done Damn...I gave up on day 2😂💀
I do what I want
Why do we do this every single day for 22 days? I thought having 48 hour breaks to let the muscles heal was necessary for growth and size. Or am I being a specimen
My god..... those abs..... damn...
I'm currently filming my journey of doing these ab exercises everyday! Already on day 9 and seeing some gains! Remember this comment cause i will upload my progress! :)
I replaced the x man with flutter kicks
I did these exercise for 3 days and my abs are a bit visible now.
Nah this didn't worked for me
Currently at day 17 and really feeling it, the results of working abs every day are evident both in look and in overall core stability I get whenever I do any phisical activity. Thank you, Jeff, for sharing you vast knowledge  Also is anyone actually decent at thread the needle? After 2 weeks I can't seem to get any close to a decent number of reps
Going to try this tomorrow As of 6/2/19 I have a small four pac nothing much. My goal is to become more fit
How many “rounds” do you do for each exercise?
So should I wait a few days if my abs are killing me? Or just keep going through the pain. I maybe lasted 5-10 seconds on every excercise today (day 3)
I’m 12 should I be doing this
This is my second day and I’m already seeing results
I wonder Jeff if I could apply this principle in a push up workout
Starting today... Lets take a PIC for the before/after
He looks like my PE teacher, but my teacher was more fat
So once you reach extinction for one you immediately move on to the next?
Hey i got a question if you got a sore muscle should you keep doing the workout ? Or just rest for a day and do it again later or just keep doing it. Because i feel like im not doing it 100% full potential because of the soreness
dia uni 👍🏼
YEP TOTALLY LEGIT
I really dont understand modern thinking;  "Crunches are bad and should be avoided". Next thing we see is "Jack knifes" and the star thingy thing, both of which contains the crunch element.   Its kind of like a artist saying "I dont ever use the colour red", yet he paints rainbows all day.
This is too hard👎
Starting this on June 1, 2019.  I’ll be back after 22 days of doing this workout and see what my results are.  I’ll post a before and after shot.
Do we do this everyday or how many times a week
Why everytime I work my lower abs I feel tension in my inner thighs... can someone relate and give some advice?
Did they mention it only works if your on steroids?  😂
I only clicked this because my tablets at 22 charge and it is 3:22
Mr. Dougherty?
Working out is hard
Step 1: Find steroids
Well sir look I don’t know what is wrong with me but I could get my Packs in 1 hour i don’t even work out I eat the most of my family like for real
What about switching up the order? Recommended or not?
I'm going to do this boys till the end of school
I’ve seen muscles on this dude that I’ve never seen before
Let’s do this 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻👍👍👍
U
Nutrition, nutrition, nutrition, nutrition, a million times nutrition!
Doing this every day how long would it take to get abs or at least seeing a difference?
How many reps should i do ??
Keeping track and not going to fake it. So if I finish it I finish it, if not ill be honest and say i gave up. Good way to start the summer so why not? I Will also be letting you know how the results are going as i go along if i see any and if i go through with it.  Day 1: ✔ Day 2: ✔ Day 3: ✔ Day 4: ✔  I'm also using weighted jump ropes so im not sure if it effects that. But I am already seeing progress and lost a few pounds.
Who stopped at jack knife
how many times a day do u do these exercises
DAY 1
In the thumbnail he looks like an insect.
Plan on doing this to help strengthen my core, posting results daily, like and comment to help keep me motivated! -Starting Date: May 28, 2019  -220lb, 5' 11" Male, already doing some other workouts with this, but this is my personal challenge for my core!   Day 1: I felt awful every single rep, but I guess that's what happens when you haven't done much core work. I couldn't finish any set fully, and the only one I did twice was the bicycle one at the end. Hopefully, my core hurts tomorrow; that means it's working!   Day 2: A little better, I managed to do the Heels to the Heavens twice, but nothing else. Core hurts a little from yesterday, but still, progress!   Day 3: Was super busy, and almost didn't do it, but I managed to squeeze it in right at the end of the day, after dinner. Still the same, only one rep of most of them, but I feel a little stronger core-wise.   Day 4: Absolutely killed it today; managed to do almost every workout twice (minus Thread the Needle), and even the stationary bike 3 times! No noticeable physical change yet, but I feel good!!   Day 5: Same as yesterday, did almost every workout twice, but the Thread the Needle still eludes me. Ah well, soon I guess.   Day 6: Hit a little wall; I couldn't do most of the workouts twice, but hopefully it's just a little bump in the road.   Day 7: Week 1 COMPLETE! It feels like forever, but I've only done this for 7 days so far. 2 more weeks to go, let's make them count! Oh also, today was great; I did 3 reps of the bicycle crunches!   Day 8: Kinda took a rest day, not on purpose, but my body wouldn't let me perform like it used to. I managed to get through most of the exercises, but not as many reps as before.   Day 9: Back again, strong as always. Burned through the reps and felt great!   Day 10-20: Didn't have service since I was out of town, but managed to still do it thanks to offline viewing! Same old results.   Day 21: SUUUPER SORe, but am definitely getting better!   DAY 22: It's over, but I'll still continue to do it. It really does take 21 days to start a habit, and I highly recommend this intense workout!
1:done  21 to go
after 2mnth of doing this i got flat stomach during my bulk
When I do alternating thread the needle my elbows start to hurt a lot, what should I do to make them stop hurting
Thanks Jeff for this one, been almost three weeks now. Lower abs and obliques look more defined...loving it
Another good one.. probably worth a shot
How can I get that
The first one I had to stop even though I wasn’t to the point of extinction because I was doing it for over 10 minutes. It’s really easy😂 but my upper abs are a lot stronger than my lower...
My only problem is in my shoulders. The left one is is rounded in and stiff, but i can move the right shoulder up and down, so a lot of times my shoulders are not in the same line (they arw not horizontal). Because of this my left chest is slightly smaller than the right. If anyone can help me with this, please reply.
jeff im getting confussed... u mean 22 straight days, without rest?
He look like Michael Scott
I'm thinking  that the skeleton in the back took "extinction" way too seriously.
Screw this im doing sit ups 😂
I’m fat like fat
Is it possible to have something similar for a lower back strengthening exercises?
I made it through 2 sets of 45 secs on the first excercise before failing on the third one, but I hurt my triceps during the process.. am I doing it wrong?
Should I do this before strength or after it?
Your videos gives me motivation sir. Thank you.
Ig I’ll hop on the bandwagon   Day 1- DONE  Day 2-DONE (did not feel good)  Day 3-DONE( a lot easier for some reason still couldn’t complete some)  Day 4-DONE (tired but still did it)  Day 5- ..... I swear I am way tooo tired today
I did the first two and I was so dead that I can't even do a sit up
Like if this worked for you
I’m 9  and I have a 4 pack to work on this was like a year or I think 4.  Or 5 months
I did it for two days now
*Coach Bloho has left*
Should I add cardio if I'm a lil chubby round the belly?
raymond has clearly gone way beyond extinction
i just can't do this, the hard floor just don't allow it, my coccyx either i could barely finish the first exercise, fuck i'm gonna die with this disgusting body fuck god
💪👍
I suppose that white guy tried this
I’m gonna do what everyone else is doing and record my progress. Need something to motivate me: Day 0: it’s 4am and got a good mind set to start tomorrow Day 1: Yea this is rough especially starting out from nothing to this. Jack knifes were the hardest but a few of them I got through 2 full extinction sets others I was close to 1. Very sore already. Hope to come back tomorrow Day 2: was still sore from yesterday but I made it through all extinction times and even 2 full on half the exercises Day 3: Just as hard as day 1 since I am so sore still.  But feel good. Feel all parts of my abs being worked out Day 4: Feeling good. Completed it all again and feel the results starting to come in Day 5: Completed- from now on since I can do the exercises I’m just going to say “Completed” unless I notice some real changes in how my abs look.
Lol, ill do these excercises, but I aint changing my nutrition.
1:56 - 45 seconds 2:45 - 45 seconds 3:22 - 12 reps 4:04 - 10 each side 4:50 - 45 seconds 5:31 - 30 seconds
Friend:White Obama can’t hurt you he doesn’t exist  Wobama:
anybody else really struggling with the alternating jackknives? or is it just my fat ass...
Will these abs workout work for ladies as well without making the waistline bigger. Thank you
Do we have to do this 2 or 3 times or 1 time only per day
This programme all days 22 or day by day i don't understand!?
I did it but abs paining I am 13 will it work
Okay my turn   Day 1 : I've done it, was hard but not that much Day 2 : My abs are really sore, it means it works well so i'm happy but this time it was really harder Day 3 : My abs are aching because of Day 1 and day 2 still managed to do it, but hopefully the pain will go away Day 4 : I've been able to do the X crunch and jack knives full round for the 1st time !!! Day 5 : Shit, I've skipped, got drunk etc.. fuck Day 6 : I'm back again, but it doesn't feel it's working as well as before Day 7 : Ye my lower back as been working during the workout it sucks, don't know why it happens
Do you guys only do 1 set of this a day or do u do it more?
Day 1 - done Day 2 - done Day 3 - DONE
does anyone also feel like the first exercise never ends and you just stop at set 5 so you can move on to the next 5 exercises?
Started from today, day 1 completed, now I have  painful  abs, but I am not gonna stay back, I'll do again on tomorrow,
He kinda favors EC3 😂 but, I'm about to tryout these new Ab workouts from the ones I been doing and see how it goes
Nice 4 pack
Started today Friday 17 at 5:36 I have done every thing  hopefully it works out God bless y’all
More like how to take drugs for 22 days
What I doing is hit a baseball over my neighbors fence
I'm a begginer, and I started today, ufff! It's really hard and fun too.
I can't feel the thread the needle on my obliques. What am I doing wrong?
Does this workout include love handles?
Ab work check Day 1 Check
Day 2 done. My abs hurt. I’ve been doing my sprints again to get back into form cardio and speed wise, but also to drop body fat I’ve gained. The combination is so sore 😭😭😭  I’d rather just stick with compound lifts and medicine ball circuits with a bosu ball but I’m deloading from that and sticking with body atm. Hopefully I don’t die.
Started this today Day 1 ✅ (a lot of pain,im dying,someone help me) Day 2 ✅(feels better than yesterday,I like it) Day 3 ✅ (I can barely see something forming,it doesn’t hurt so much) Day 4. ✅(feels a lot easier than on day 1,thinking about doing this 2 times a day) Day 5 ✅(completed) Day 6 ✅ Day 7 ✅
Extinction level. Brilliant
Hey Guys I need your help to get Jeff to notice this..! How do I solve debilitating abdominal cramps??  (And occasionally finger cramping (middle finger both hands) I train abs maybe once or twice a week. Am always reluctant to as I get crazy cramping. Usually in my top left ab , and the only way to stretch it out is via dead hanging from a pull up bar.  These cramps don’t just occur from ab exercise. I get them mid deadlift and many other exercises. Where I’m suddenly forced to stop and stretch out.  I’ve been training for over 8 years - am around 18% bf (one month a year I drop to 12% bf roughly)  Can you help me solve ? As it’s starting to effect my training as I get older!  It’s not hydration (2.1L a day with some electrolytes to lock in )  To give an idea. I’ll get to 30 really good sit ups in a row and I need to dead hand for about 5 min to realeasw the cramp!!
How many Calories does it burn for this entire session? Thanks.
Well, lets follow the trend and do this. Mixing this is in with my 3 days of kickboxing and 4-5 days of lifting, hoping itll motivate me to get my eating plan back on track (Im at 160 and walk around 150). I wont post daily updates but will try to remember to edit this comment occasionally
It was the third day
Can a teenager do these exercises?
I'm getting little changes
Inspired by another post, I’m going to start doing this, and I’ll update my progress daily   - -
How many days til I see an easily distinguishable six pack?
bro how can i donate to you? you have helped so much
Well organized!
Day 0- Grounded for vaping but I'll see if I can sneak my phone to write these every day. Just now prepping for my first workout tomorrow!
I did this for 30 days and I am ripped asf 🙌
Help , i started today , but i cant seem to do the last 2 ex. Properly not even close to it . It just kinda dont work.
Done my first day.. i will say if i got results in the end of 22 days if i forget to, just reply
Challenge Accepted. Day 1 done. I'm gonna keep a private journal to keep me on track.
For the first one iñ boxing we call them 6 inches
Can anyone please tell me where to find these shoes? Anyone plzzz help..!
You need to be my PT , my ABS hurt watching
No pain no gain
Day 2: going pretty well. The first 4 days going to be hardest. Day 3:didn't post yesterday but did my workout  Day 4:  if u r beginner and ur abs dont pain first 4 days then u r doning it wrong
I'll just start tomorrow
I've been doing this for a few weeks, and hitting it hard with other workouts, you can't just do this and expect a 6 pack and lose belly fat, good nutrition and other workouts daily also contribute. My abs are coming in slowly but surely. Just don't expect abs like him in 22 days lol
2:30
can't do a single xman crunch😐
Sir I want to ask you a question that as i am a skinny guy can I do abs workout.???
I’ve been doing a couple abs work for a couple weeks or so and I’ve lacked for about 3 or 4 days I don’t remember, but after seeing this and reading the comments and seeing everyone posting there updates motivates me. I’ll be staring tomorrow this challenge tomorrow since it’s late already
Can I contact this guy
I saw people doing updates, so I’ll try to tell you guys my progress.   Day 0- I’m scared as heck.  Day 1-  •I did the first on for 6 minutes straight and didn’t feel anything so I think I did it wrong, but moving on.  •I couldn’t do the second one as well because I am on carpet and my feet keep slipping. •
Old and unnatural shape.
22 days straight? I thought the abs is the same as any other muscle that needs rest? Can anyone enlighten me?
I'm one year post partum is this reccomend for a beginner/ woman?
So basically you do everything until failure
Lol Jeff is like the Joel Osteen of fitness lol
This video helps
1:49 1st, Heels to the Heavens (45 secs) 2:38 2nd, Step Through Planks (45 secs) 3:12 3rd, "X" Man Crunch (12 reps) 3:46 4th, Alternating Thread the Needle (10 reps per side) 4:34 5th, Alternating Jackknives (45 secs) 5:19 6th, Stationary Bikes (30 secs)
Just make an app so much easier 😅
My lower back pains while working out on my abs☹️ what to do
Imma do this today: May 9  (I’ll keep posted) Ok so I’m fucking ripped: May 21
Awesome... finding the Jack knife the hardest for sure
I thought you wasn't suppose to work your abs everyday?
Wow thanks much helping me big time
If he had a deeper voice he could pass as Christian Bale
After the 22 days do u do this every day Jeff. Will there be any negative results if it is a daily workout?
Wouldn’t you burn out faster in the later rounds? So if you start with bottom up workouts and top Down later, wouldn’t the bottom abs get worked out harder since you probably won’t last as long in the later flounder of top down?
Just started, Wish me luck!  For cardio, I'm on the trampoline alot and kickboxing (I'm skinny so I don't think cardio needs to be intense) doing flips and whatever I feel like  DAY 1 - heels to the heavens - 1, very close to 2 (38 seconds) Step through planks - 2 reps but I'm probably doing it wrong X men crunch - 2 reps - Jesus christ this is the most painful for me Alternating thread the needle - I kept Losing my balance how do y'all start balanced?! - 1.5 reps Couldn't carry on with last 2 exercises After today I'll not go into detail with exception to the last day (22) DAY 1 ✅  DAY 2 ✅ (managed to do a rep for last 2 exercises) abs are burning DAY 3 ✅ I Tried going more like his pace and got the same reps as yesterday and started integrating other stuff like deadlifts, shoulder scrunches and behind the head lifts DAY 4 ✅ - I did as normal but some of the pain had gone away - I'm not as tingly as before - couldn't do stepthrough planks due to leg injury DAY 5 - ✅ was able to do my higher reps so easily and done more reps but I didn't, still struggle with my lower rep stuff DAY 6 - ✅ DAY 7 -
This looks brilliant, I'm going to give a start tomorrow :D
Hi Jeff, hope u can answer my question. Since i have lower back injury, wonder if i can still do any lower abs exsersise without any harm to my lower back?

Epic. I'm a noob, so I'm gonna use this to set a baseline and see how much I improve over the next 22 days. Thanks so much for all the videos! I'm a huge fan :)
Loved the video jeff it was very helpful 😎💪💪
Soft count or hard count on the second workout
Impressive exercises....but what should be the diet associated with it?
i died on the x man crunch
I couldn’t do the all 45 minutes on every exercise but I’m glad I tried and pushed myself :))
People who disliked this video went to extinction.
Starting now will update in 30 days  if this get enough feed back
Im going to try this out. I found this video yesterday and did the work out for fun, but I'm thinking on actually going through with it.   Day 2- 3 sets of heels to heaven   3 step through planks   3 x man crunches   4 thread the needle   2 jackknives   3 stationary bikes  Day 3- same amount of sets and I ran 3 miles after  Day 4- 2 heels   2 step through planks   3 xman crunches   2 thread the needle   2 jackknives   3 bicycles   And 2 mile run  Day 5- 4 heels to the heavens   2 step through planks   4 x man crunches   3 thread the needle   2 jackknives   3 bicycles  2.4 mile run  These last two days I havent slept well because of homework, so im feeling pretty tired.  Day 6- 4 heels   4 step through planks   5 x man crunches   3 thread the needle   3 jackknives   4 bicycles    3.8 mile run
All of these are absolutely pointless unless you follow a good diet, and you know full well that I’m right. Just trying to get more money before you finally tell people what they need to do. You want abs anyone? Follow a good diet, maintain a calorie deficit. And you’ll have a six pack within around 4-8 weeks depending on how big you were before starting.

those alternating jackknifes are the bane of my exaistance!!! lol
Hi I am ved  I have already 2packs
My favorite fitness youtuber
Great info here. Been looking for an intense ab workout. Just finished day 1 will let you all know on day 22.
A rest day is not needed?
How many sets do we do
2 weeks before I go camping and I barley found this video. Let's see what I can do in 2 weeks
Can i do this every single day? What about resting? And what about doing other workouts in between, can i add them just to my normal training? Would be nice if someone could give me an answer after that long period of time
For beginners do this workout just go for less time after the first week go for 45 second
Ive been doin abs for 3 years an look nothn like thaat
Day 1 ✅ literally just layed down on the floor after this,  almost dead. Day 2 ✅ abs have been hurting all day but manage to complete it and it was a it easier this time TBH Day 3 ✅ abs started to burn in the first exersice already and I don't think I did as well as yesterday although I completed it cause there was just too much pain,  but I'll try again tomorrow Day 4✅ abs were really burning at the end but was great overall definitely better than yesterday. Day 5 ✅ abs didn't actually hurt today,  probably getting used to it already and I can definitely see myself improving abit. Day 6 ✅ Had a long pull day today,  and I really didn't wanna finish it with with this ab routine but still did it. Definitely not one of my best today but atleast I showed up. Day 7 ✅ Finished the night with abs and it was great!  Some of the exercises are getting pretty easy but overall was great today! Day 8  ✅ abs were really on fire today,  did it at night too and was amazing.  Can't wait for tmr! Day 9 ✅ today's one was probably the least effective cause I only did like one round of each.  Was super tired and didn't have much time but atleast I did it. Can't wait for day 10 Day 10✅ this really feels like a everyday routine RN and still going strong.  Almost halfway there Day 11✅ halfway there,  and this relh feels like a routine,  no joke.
when you're done working out do you ever eat a bag of puff Hot Cheetos?
Dude some of his skin looks fake
What's sad is I'm 13 and I live my life doing parkour in the woods and riding motorcycles and yet I have a six pack and I don't do any of this Fancy stuff people just need to Be more active and stop being lazy
Thanks  You just gave me an excuse to workout on Sundays
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE GUY IN THE BACK??? HE OVER DID HIM SELF WAS IT JARRED FROM SUB WAY???😂😂😂
I will try to train abs every day but I don't want to train the obliques so I will just mix some other exercices.
I want to know about veg food diet.
Working out abs for 22 days straight
Can u plss make a video on your diet plan???
Gonna write my progress here just to help me stay commited Day 1: Yes I just finished my first day and it's pretty easy for me or maybe I just expected too high. But I can feel the pain in my abs and I'm loving it
I started seeing changes at around 3 days
Workout diary: (will be updating) Day 0/Day1/Day2 155sec/145sec/142sec 110sec/90sec/130sec 15 rep /22rep/17rep 10 rep /15rep/16rep 40 sec/75sec/70sec 45 sec/70sec/62sec Result:  Day0- Physically tired. Can't do any more reps correctly. Although I didn't sweat nor I feel cardio. Day1 - Starting with some sore of yesterday. I feel my stanina dimished in comparison to yesterday. Still didn't sweet although I feel more tired than yesterday. I feel my abs more rigid though. Day2 - Started with more sore. it feels like adding up. I get tired quickly than Day0. I try to be more precise with movement. It feel harder to keep posture of the back and abs. Still no sweet. Less cardio than yesterday.  QUESTION: I'm doing it everyday up until now. It's that ok? Should I have a rest day or something?
Day one thanks for reminding me I am fat and out of shape I appreciate it lol
Yo what about the rest day?
Concentrate please don't read comments
i just actually tried this for 22 days.  i have a skinny fat type of body and when i tried this i didnt follow his rule that "if you still can do it you need to continue until failure before you can go to the next exercise" i just did all the exercise for 22 days and yeah it still works i have 4 packs now. so i guess if i followed his rule this will look even better. but not following it still works!
How many rounds?
My hips are uneven what can i do? Its so painful. Please help
I'll start tomorrow and update this every day. Let's do this!  * If I can do this, you can do this!*  Day 1: Was harder than I thought, but finished it nevertheless. (1,5x heels to heaven but only 5x each side thread the needle. Feeling: happy that I started, abs are harder after the workout than before.  Day 2: completed the whole workout! (2x heels to heaven). Threas the needle is still hard but it's going better! Feeling: my abs feel a bit painful but it's doable. Hope to complete this all!  Day3: my abs are pretty much burning, even before the workout. The workout was pretty easy and I start to remember the excercises. Feeling: pretty good, and after I am done with this workout, I feel the whole day pretty strong  Day4: my belly hurts but nevertheless finished the workout! The fact that my muscles hurt is a good way to tell that this actually helps!  Day 5: I felt so tired today haha, so instead of doing this in the morning, I did it in de evening. My abs are not burning heavily anymore, and I actually did the workout without sweating a lot. Seems that the positve effects are already noticable. Feeling: abs feel stronger, and I might sleep better after doing the workout before bedtime. Will keep you updated!
hey Jeff, just gotta say I absolutely love your videos! doing this routine now for a bit more then a week and i can already see improvements in abs and stamina for each excersice! You have a great motivational attitude that really helps me going after i struggled for the past years to get myself into shape! Thanks so much!
As of right now its day 3 of extinction..... this hurts.... I'm soooooo sore
THANK YOU SO MUCH I got good abs and I watched so many of your vids to complete this I AND IM ONLY 12 again thank you so much I could have not done it with out you god bless
Day 1
I'm going to start doing this, and ill update my progress everyday. . Day0: Im getting mentally ready to destroy my abs. . Day1: I barely finished it, my abs got on fire after a half of this training. . Day2: It was even worse, my abs were still sore after first day, but i compeleted it. . Day3: skipped due to personal stuff, but i cant let myself to fail, i can do IT, i will do it for 23 days! . Day4: almost forgot to update. Completed, pain is still there, but i dont feel it as much as i did. . Day5: Pain was nearly gone overnight so i could finish this earlier, it feels kinda easier to do these, and i can somewhat see my upper abs forming. . Day6: Complete . Day7:Completed . Day8: Finished, pain is almost non existant now . Day9: Complete . Day10: Finished, almost 50% done baby . Day11: Completed . Day12: Another day, another dollar . Day13: Done
I finally finished the this 22 day abs workout and I have to say it didn’t work for me. BUT at the end of it I do see an outline of my abs without good lighting so If I do carry on I would say you are likely to get abs in more like 44-50 days but this is great for beginners
the planks, im definitely doing it wrong. toes hurt, knees hurt, elbows hurt. the kicking my leg through i dont feel it really
Cool
About to do this for the next 22 days.. Let’s see what happens 😅💀🔥
Day 1🙏
Day 1: I'm sweating, need to work on better reps in future
Hi , Are these exercises good for me if I have lower back pain?
I'm a pretty fit guy but I couldn't do the jack the riper one idk y? Am I the only one??
HIIT Cardio 30mins + Jeff's dumbbell complex + this = the funnest cardio abs session
When my legs are 6 inches-ish above the ground when on my back, my back arches and hurts really bad after, any tips? I’m kind of tall if that has anything to do with it.
I follow all this steps of ab workout....and I saw good results of my abs...thnks “ AX ” for this video
I literally have to do over 5 minutes  one exercise which is kinda stupid
Is it safe to keep hitting the same group of muscles everyday without rest?
Tell diet
Your the man!
I would love if you made a video using gymnastics rings!
How much rest between sets?
This helped so much, I used this https://tinyurl.com/y2mpu35q after the 22 days.
It’s my first day  After exercise 3, feels like vomit then stopped   Positive fr day 2
I like them shoes, anyone know the name?
Day 1 : done Day 2 : pain Day 3 : pain Day 4 : Okay Day 1 done
is this really what he did to get such abs
Who got a six pack by doing this cause I don’t wanna waste my time just to motivate me more
Can you do a full boy resistance band work out please
Day 1: ok no excuse let’s do this Day 2: wow my abs are sore..only could hold half the time as yesterday rip Day 3: Day 4: Day 5: Day 6: Day 7: Day 8: Day 9: Day 10: Day 11: Day 12: Day 13: Day 14: Day 15: Day 16: Day 17: Day 18: Day 19: Day 20: Day 21: Day 22:
Never give up Today you are more near to your goal than previous day
im gonna do this day 2 done my abs starting to show day 3 done almost same as day 2 day 4 done seeing my abs getting more muscular
Tried doing this, but I cant even do the V-sit esq exercises. lol Shame, the x-man one looks impressive. My legs are just too heavy for my top half and my abs aren't strong enough yet. T.T
I have an 8 pack and I am 8
1:49 1st, Heels to the Heavens (45 secs) 2:38 2nd, Step Through Planks (45 secs) 3:12 3rd, "X" Man Crunch (12 reps) 3:46 4th, Alternating Thread the Needle (10 reps per side) 4:34 5th, Alternating Jackknives (45 secs) 5:19 6th, Stationary Bikes (30 secs)
Should this really be done daily? Isn't it ill-advised to train any muscle group daily?
`Every like I get Ill do one sit-up wish me luck 😊
Be back 22 days with my Instagram for my results!! 🤪😊 wish me luck!!
From tomorrow onwards I am going to start and update it everyday let's do it 22days abs challenge
👍👍👍👍👍
Sir can low carbs help me to get my abs and by performing abs exercises daily after Mai workout
B
Is this a circuit like do have i have do 3 rounds of these? Anyway it looks interesting gonna try it.
I have abs from wrestling, but they are starting to fade away, you can still see them but i stopped eating good food and went back to my regular food, i will do this 21 day challenge, and come back and see what’s up
Does this actually work? I'm trying to get my summer body starting today
i will start this tonight
We have the same abs but im missing the obliques
no joke its hard for me to get to extinction any advice
How long does this take
Everyone's doing it so, Day Zero- Here we go! Day One- Skip Day Two- Skip Day Three- Skip Day F.....Ah you get the point.
Do u take breaks in between or just straight work out?
Thank you.
How to fix winging scapula
I already have a mini 4 pack but it only show when I flex but other than that it don’t show and I want my other missing 2 packs so ima do these workouts and post daily about my progress.  Day 1 ✅ : was challenging since I haven’t worked on abs in awhile   Day 2 ✅ : woke up and stretched and oh my god bro… my core was soooo freaking sore!!! so I just stop stretching but later on got workout done.  Day 3 ✅ : felt lazy but realized I’m already in and there’s no backing out and got workout done but so far no results yet  Day 4 ✅ : was hard to find time to complete workouts but managed to squeeze it in. But so far no results yet.
The biggest thing you can do to get a 6 pack is a calorie deficit
can we long running in morning after evening Gym workout?
Does it really give you abs? I need to work on my lower and get bigger upper abs? 😂  please respond.
Day 1 Day 2 Day 3 Day 4 Day 5
Just when I was getting used to the 7 Minute Ab Workout I saw this one thanks for the pain I love it and my wife loves the results
I have got tailbone injury during commando training. Suggest few exercises to overcome the injury.  Thank you
i will say for the minority of people (like myself) who have a no quitting/failure, mind over matter attitude, i recommend not to continue the same movement more than 3 times before moving to the next one or you will be too sore to even attempt these workouts by day 3-4
starting this today, lets do this
I ll try it really works
I did this for the first time and got a six pack the same day.      A six pack of beer. I was so sore I needed a drink
When would you recommend doing these exercises? First thing in the morning is also OK, backwise? Thanx
This training hurts😂😂
Just started today did about 5:45 on Heels to Heaven then 2:45 in step plank and 3:00 in X-men and threads was 2:00 and bike for 3:00! Just taking it slow on the first day of this excrise cycle will continue updating till day 22
Day 1:Done
so...to clarify.  you do each exercise until you fail to meet the goal right?   For example, if I make it through Heels to the Heavens twice, I dont move on, I keep doing Heels to Heavens until I can finish the set? Of do I only do each exercise a max of two sets?
Ill came back after 23 day and tell u what happens
greattt
Hey Guys, I've done this complete workout once and my abs are extremely sore from the last 3 days. Should I do the workout again anyway?
My back suppose to be arching while I’m doing the hells to heaven
Plz work on your pecks
Decline barbell press
Hey Jeff !! 22 days without rest ?
Started, made  progress within month.(Feel better!!!!)
What diet should I get for abs.?
Couldn't no rest be counterproductive to seeing results? Don't the muscles need rest?
This is great, I am going to try this out. I will start today and I will take a picture of the progress everyday and on the 22nd day I will post my results.
So am female  73kg  5'2 am going to start this exercise on 10th of April 2019 with a juice diet (most of my fat is concetrated on my chest stomach and back) will keep you updated if this works  *DAy 1(10/4/19) --->That was brutal my elbows hurt couldn't finish the second last exercise I did it for less than 40 sec I hope it becomes easier.  *DAy 2(11/4/19) --->I have scratched my elbows they cant take do (Step through plank and Alternating thread the needle) i did those less than 10 sec others are quite easy for me ..am starting to see some difference on my stomach btw b4 I do this workout I do a 20MINS staircase run.for The juicing I make random green stuff in my fridge .
should I be doing these with a bad lower back it does not hurt now but will these cause back pain
I have no disc between L4 &L5. Is this routine safe for me???
Are you suppose to do it everyday I thought you suppose to let your muscles rest a day in between?
Anyone else starting today??? Well, along this workout i'm also doing the 10min fat burning workout..  Day 1 - done Can't even perform some of the reps for the designated time..One word to express after the workout....PAIN!!!! Day 2 - still can't perform all the workout... Day 3 - almost there.... Day 4 - 18 days left Day 5 - baby steps
I have a lot lot of belly fat and I'm going to see my packs soon. I will stick to it for months
I did the heels to heaven 6 times on day one. I did all the other exercises several times. I eat well. I run so my body fat should be low. Why don't I have abs?
How much rest do you get in between workouts?
I really did for consective 55 days and i just got 2 abs which are little prominent but m happy and would achieve 6 abs after another month.
👍
Wait how would one progressively overload these workouts
Starting today lets see ...
What is the best time in one day to do this set?
I’ve gone through 2 days so far I’m fairly skinny I’d say about 15-16% body fat and I have a like a 2 pack so we’ll see how this does
When i do Jack knife and x man crunch I feel it hurt really bad on my lower back and nothing in my abs. What am I doing wrong?
So far 21 days done: day21: April 24 day20: April 23 day19: April 22 day18: April 21 day17: April 20 day16: April 19 day15: April 18 day14: April 17 missed : April 16 (worked 22 hours)  day13: April 15 day12: April 14 day11: April 13 day10: April 12 day9:April 11 day8: April 10 day7: April 9 day6: April 8 day5: April 7 day4: April 6 day3: April 5 day2: April 4 day1: April 3
In punjabi bro
Did that, absolutely nothing fucking happened, (with clean as fuck diet no coffee no sweets no dirty calories no nothing but fruits vegetables and protein foods). My bellyfat is immortal
I’m starting this ab workout Today but I’ve been working on them two days in a row but a different workout I can’t wait to see the results at the end of the 22 days
how long do you rest in-between each different workout? i am a beginner and i cant even reach 30 seconds haha.
Nice
how many sets should I do for each exercise?
I am not able to do X-MEN CRUNCH.  What should I do for it???
the jack knives are killing me
I wonder if I do it twice per day for 11 days......
Day1✔now I hope I can move tomorrow!
Not u athlean ur skinny my brother said that
patuchi11 is    FAT
Yeah, I've just got one problem... When I should repeat it every time I managed getting through those 45 secs, I'd at the end be at a 30 minute ab workout every day... I mean it's fun to me but I gotta keep me from overtraining again so how often should I repeat the exercise?
How do you upkeep once you've done 22 days? Is this my life now?!
Started this today, will update each day Day 1 —> 🤢 Difficult but got through it, feeling nauseous but excited! Day 2 —> 😫 Just as tough as the first day, but there’s more muscle pain than nausea. Still working at it! Day 3 —> 🥴 Getting easier, did two sets of the first exercise and one set of the rest. Muscles still hurt. Day 4 —> 😯 Getting a lot easier, I’m able to do exercises more than once. Definitely see my abs forming! Day 5 —> 😐 Not much change from the previous day except that my abs don’t hurt as much Day 6 —> 😶 Abs no longer ache, exercises are getting easier, and abs forming. Pretty neutral day
Day1:   the x man crunch got me bad 😭 , everything else was pretty difficult but manageable, the thread thingy was challenging asf but i managed one time.       Like and drop a comment if you all want daily updates.  I’ll find a way to get a before and after picture up  Day2: forms getting better and feeling the workout in places i didn’t the first time around. The jack knife form is proven to be a little difficult, trying to elevate the way he does is hard but I got it done. I feel good and although no abs are showing my stomach does feel tighter and more flat. All the workouts still proven a little difficult  Day 3: form getting better and getting through all workouts.  Sore as hell and this work out won’t ease the pain. Still really hate threading the needle  Day 4: family event caused me to miss work outs  Day 5: not really sore anymore, gotten a lot better at the workout. The threading the needle is ridiculously hard and I get through it but I still haven’t gotten use to it. Stomachs definitely doesn’t pop out anymore. Feels like potential progress will be made  Day6: works getting easier , still haven’t seen a significant change
Day1 1.Heels to the heavens-done 2.Step through planks-no 3.X man crunch-Thumps up 4.Alternating thread the needle-No 5.Alternating jacknefes-yes 6 Stationary bikesg-little bit
Did the workout this morning. Yah Jeff makes it look so much easier than it really is
M working a lot on my chest but its no picking up the growth that i need. How i can solveout this problem.please tell. I m using even weight gainer also   i got result on tricep and back and shoulder as well. But no on chest. Please help me out
the problem is that i can't get my back off theground for the exercises that are not plank
Just did day 1, barely got through one set each exercise, but it's progress! Bring on the next 21 days.
Did I still get an abs if I do it 22 times 3 days?
Started this yesterday. Will update at the end of 22 days
Your so skinny go get some gains 👎
Im new to all of this so I'm a tad bit confused. Can you do this for more than 22 days or does it have to end there? Sorry for asking a question that is most likely obvious.
Jeff, looks awesome, i just cant remember all of em at gym¡!¡¡!¡!
Will start this tomorrow, we'll see how it goes
Day 1= Done, Struggled with the thread the needle and planks.
If i finish and exercise how much time should i take between exercises?
I'm watching this vid from my workplace and there's no audio here. Can someone explain if this is a one time workout for the day or a circuit with X number of sets?
How many set each ? Thank you
Excellent advise the older you get the easier it is to gain a habit so if you are young and you fall off the schedule one day jump back on the next. Above all do not ever give up on yourself. All the best Jack
is it ok to skip in the weekends? i work 16 hours shifts in weekends. and are there any diet restrictions? I am on a low carb diet.
The guy in the background tried a bit too hard
Thaanks gandalf
I try it
Can’t wait to give this a shot
You're on steroids.
I am unable to do the alternating jack knives properly. Please help. It's my day 3. And almost I am able to do the others not for the entire 45 sec though.
I like to think of it as a changed mindset more so than creating a habit... habits can be broken a strong mindset can't!!!
Start this day 💪🏻
Excuse my language your knowledge is fuccin amazing I haver learned so much from u
Do you do several reps or just once?
not related but had a dude at the gym today ask me to spot him on dumbell shoulder presses. and I've never heard of this espeacilly since that's a reason to use dumbbells in the first place and I couldnt see a placement to not remotely get in the way of his movement. so like is this actually a thing? I just dont see the need for a spotter at all using dumbbells.
Note for everyone. If good you've been going easy on yourself a few months with abs...you are going to feel this... Just finished day 2 and improved my form much more. I can really feel this today.
Thanks Jeff
Sweet
I’m gonna give you guys results no bull starting tomorrow I will tell you exactly how I look and feel   Day 1: got me tired good ab workout still sore
What diet should be needed for making ads
Instead of 45 seconds I really pushed myself and went to 2 minutes with 1 minute cool down and saw better results
You definitely come through for my gains
Anyone neck hurts when doing the last one ?
Is this supposed to be 22 consecutive days?
This guy's freaky lookin...
Only Jeff can disguise interpretive dancing as an ab workout!
I thought you said rest is important for muscle recovery Jeff. 👍
I've been giving this a try, and I am quite out of shape, first 2 days were difficult, but I did what I could of every exercise, but by day 3, simply getting in to the position to do the exercises felt impossible. I simply couldn't do some of the exercises as my body gave out before trying them.  Edit, tried again a few minutes later after stretching and relaxing, I managed to do some even though I barely reached 15 seconds of doing this for each exercise, and felt like puking after finishing the entire exercise. Will keep this routine up, but my body feels like it won't be able to keep this up.
○Day one- done ! ○Day two- done! (Hurts a lot from the last work out) ○Day three- done! (Feeling exauted but still completed and still a lil bit of pain is there but no results yet) ○Day four- done! (Did more reps pain is gone and no results though felt good not exauted ) ○Day five- done! ( felt lil good did more reps,not exausted , i can feel my abs but under a layer of fat lets see how far i can go ) ○Day six- done! ( fell down on the road (while running ) got some major and minor scratch on my  body because of the pain i did less reps of thread through needle but still completed the workout still the same results) ○Day seven- done! ( no results yet, it is same as before ○Day eight- done! (I see my abs barely with perfectly angled lighting i think i have to reduce my fat )  [THANX FOR THE LIKES AND NICE COMENTS ]  ○Day nine- done! (Did more reps but same results as before) ○Day ten- done! ( more visible then before) ○Day eleven-done! (Same result but got a fat layer because i ate a cone of ice cream yesterday which is not good for burning fat )  [Gonna restart from day one as i was not able to do day 12, 13,14,15 and 16 as because of some problems] Day 1 - done!  Day 2 - done!
I cant do heaven to the heals cause of my buldging disc thay pinches a nerve and i hate it! Im 23 years old and it fkn sucks!
ight so i’ve always had a passion for working out to become my best self (going to the gym 5/6 days a week) but i’ve always brushed off abs and never really did them. so i want to finally stop making excuses and form a habit. this seems like it’ll help, so i’ll be keeping track here to keep myself motivated.   day 1: i can tell my form is awful but i got thru the workout anyways, better to keep on going instead of just giving up. my stomach feels tighter with a lil burn but that’s about it  day 2: let me just tell u that my abs are BURNING from yesterday and hurt like hell to finish today but i did it. my form has gotten better and i actually feel each movement when working them  day 3: woke up with no ab pain. got straight in to the workout and it was a pretty good one, didn’t hurt as much and i could do a lot more. definitely feel a difference but i don’t see any changes yet. i’ll keep y’all updated :)  day 4: wow my abs are so much stronger. i got thru more sets of some exercises. pain has completely gone apart from the burning pain i get while working out and i can kinda see a v taper forming. i definitely need to adjust my diet i have that little bit of fat that might be covering me seeing any changes  day 5: wasn’t rlly feeling that good today but i got through the workout and it was okay. i’m starting to see my obliques pop out and my stomach is tighter and i can kinda see the outline of my top 4 abs in good lighting  day 6: my abs are a lot stronger and my workouts are longer since i can do more sets overall. not really any change unless i’m in really good lighting i can see the outline of my top 4 abs forming, i definitely feel like i’ll see results by the end of this it’s going well  day 7: really late workout but got it done didn’t finish it due to lack of sleep over the past few days but i did as much as i could  day 8 & 9: i missed both days sadly i wasn’t feeling that good on monday and yesterday i was just lazy..   day 10: i did the workout pretty easily. it felt good and i was full of energy but i need to make up for the days i missed by doing an extra 2 days
Isn't it bad to work on your core everyday??
I have a terrible lower back pain during this what should i do?
Why does he always film without a shirt
I'm  trying  to  get  back in shape after a car accident  leaving me with  3 herniated  discs  in my lower back. Is this workout  suitable for me?
Teach us how to build Forearms please
How long do you take a break for between each exercise?
is there a certain way to breath while doing the workouts?
I can really feel it and it feels great to. From: Kaley Baker
I am starting today...I will update everyday.....
are you allowed to rest between the exercises? If so, how long?
sarcasm over level 100 4:28
I never did any explosive ab training, all legit recruitment and articulation to do so, slow to moderate speed. Not sure it leads to any depth. Its more years of strain and gens.
How many times to do this in a day????
still on round 1, help
Tq coach
Day one today... I already know I won’t need more than one set, but I’m excited to give this a try. My stomach is going to killllllll
uh how are your ab muscles going to grow and get stronger when you don’t give yourself a rest day...? can someone explain that 😂
Have done that over a week. Love these exercises. Surely will do it every morning right after I wake up. Thanks Jeff 😘😘
I can do this workout at the same time i do my normal workout(chest,arms,legs,back,etc) ?
Awesome, abs on fire
I'm going for it started today Hopefully I can get better at this I didn't do bad for the first time but definitely not where I wanna be Thank you for this routine I kept  doing just random workouts and wasn't getting any type of results
Why do I get upper back pain when I am doing the step through planks?
I killed my self doing this
So how many sets do we do?
I find thjs video very helpful.  Thanks Jeff!!
Sir please provide a diet chart as well for the abs..Very much in need sir
I’m trying to get some abs rn and I’m gonna try this, wish me luck
Iam going to school daily the packs will become after 21 days so I like athlean
1 sub. ...3 subscribers
I don't want move away from the point of the video... but, I always wondered if Athlean-X's theme song is a remix of the song "Weenie Beenie" by Foo Fighters. :)
What is the best time to do the workout
i started 18/03/2019 .8072798114 any enquiry my whats app mumber..from.India tamilnadu.
Its doesn’t show much on 22th day well it a 1.5 month workout
U are the best my friend
Can  I ask an English question? I am from Taiwan. What is "with extinction" 01:00 "extinction-style"00:57? What is "reach extinction"? I check dictionary, it say, " The extinction of a species of animal or plant is the death of all its remaining living members. " from Collins Dictionary.
Did this on a carpet the rug burns where not fun
Day 1:kind of tired,my abs are working,see how IT goes Day 2: my abs are burning,seeing some results already! Day3:improve my rezistance,i think i need a diet later  ,for abs to be more vizible Day 4: diet starts TODAY (no sugar) Abs are good Day5 :proud of my results,i do like 2-5 rows at each exercise.  Day 6: Good day Note:do some streching before starting
Not for attention (maybe a little) but day 1 starts today!!! 21 days left!!!!!!!!!
I am curious. Is there a point to train your abs every day with no real room to recover? I mean I could see that you should allow your body to recover after 22 days but what is the benefit from doing this everyday for 22 days rather than say 3 times a week, allowing your muscles to recover?
Here's my result  Day 1 : feel very hard to even start the first exercise so I took a lots of timeout.and their were pain that night on my abdomen,Day 2 to 3 were almost same  Day 4 : couldn't feel much pain  Day 5 : now able to adjust to the workout a bit  Day 6 : going great,no sign of abs yet  Day 12 : after some days my upper abs showed up a tiny  bit  Day 13-14 : just the same workout  Day 15: changes are coming ,now I feel the abs are getting tighter Day 16 : loses some hair,idk why  Day 17: feel like a complete unstoppable machine  Day 18 : ok  look good but losing hair  Day 19 : woke up bald this morning  Day 20: all my body shredded ,wtf Day 21 : I think I'm completed in this world ,I had gone bald and gain immense strength,imma 1v1 saitama  Thank you,this workout is op ,I suggest you try too 💗
Shouldn't there be rest days? How will the abs heal?
Day: 14  I forgot about this comment but I’m doing good starting to see some results
This is the hardest ab routine I've ever done once again Jeff kicks my butt I've never realized how long 45 seconds truly are thanks for all you do
Jackknifes hurt my neck
I will start tomorrow and i will post results everyday! Wish me luck🔥  Day 1. My stomach hurts a little bit but i feel very good, more uptate will came soon!   Results: None   Day 2:   I didn’t got any time, so this WAS a rest day:/  Results: none  Day 3:  I did the workout 2 times today, i think im a little bit more shredded/ripped.  Results: in good lighting i can see some 4 pack but not very much, but i keep going, for mostly i eat vegetagles (fruits) and rice with chicken😅  Day 4:  Rest day:///  Day 5: its hard to skip sugar and junk food and sometimes i eat it. But in 2 days im gonna try a healthy diet.  Results: in VERY GOOD lighting i can see some abs but not that good:/  Day 6: My abs hurt a little bit but they feel stronger. I think i have burned a little bit fat on my stomach. For people who wonder what BF i have, i have like 18% bf. For me everything is possible so if ppl says its not possible to get a six pack with this bf, i dont care what somebody says. This is my goal and i gonna work for it, *dont Wish for it, work for it*😀   Results: i can see some abs in good lighting but i still see a little layer of fat over my abs, give me luck please!.
#steroids lol
Hey Jeff. Thank you for this video. I am on day 7 of the 22 day challenge. This video/set of workouts has helped me a lot. I started seeing the results on day 5.

Is this applicable for skinny guys
Can someone plz tell me what app to use for the timer?
Look I'm real dumb so I don't get this extinction thing...I get that there's no rest between failed exercises..But what if I fail every time? won't It be quite Inevitable just stopping or not doing enough? I am very dumb
Day 1 Started 😁

Told to my friends that they could bang my gf if I don’t have abs in 2 months, hope this helps!

Thank you for helping me fail forward. So that I can succeed
Started this for a challenge alongside my normal 4 days a week routine, Hope this works! Day 1: All sets to extinction, very sweaty progress: I'm relatively slender, so abs show already but they feel stronger  Day 2: Harder to all the sets, but made extinction to each one, and still very sweaty progress: I think?  Day 3: Seemed a bit easier, almost double sets from my first day Progress: abs feel tight and strong  Day 4: almost felt like day one, everything was just a bit harder, especially jackknives. progress: abs feel tight and strong nothing visually yet\  Day 5: All sets were easier this day, still struggling on the jacks progress: again a sweaty workout, upper abs really feel the strongest  Day 6: Did better on all workouts, at least one more set or half till extinction progress: still the same  Day 7: Feeling my muscles activating and really feeling the work, heels to heaven feels harder when arms raised above the head, for side step placks I start feeling my obliques, I can do at least a set more of x men crunches!, Needles got 1 more set up, jacks are also getting easier, stationary bikes got tougher, probably because I can do them properly now with the rest of my muscles stronger Progress: I can see the outline of my ab space, my side looks good compared to the first few days  Day 8: Still going strong Progress: same  Day 9: Some workouts were harder than others, jack knives still being difficult.  Progress: I can see a 4 pack coming in when the lighting is right  Day 10: All the workouts are hitting me hard, I think my body is finally getting used to what I'm putting it through and it's stressing the muscles now, this is good Progress: My obliques are the most visible rn, but I can see a 4 pack forming.  Day 11: Soreness all over, did most 1 set of each  Progress: looks about the same  Day 12: pretty much the same as day 11 sore, but 2 sets for most workouts Progress: stomach feels hard, visibly not much still.  Day 13: sets were a bit easier, about 2 for each, except the dreaded jackknives. Progress: my stomach feels tighter, but looks pretty much the same still  Day 14: All sets were easier, I substituted jack-knives for an easier variant that would build the muscle because I feel like it would be more worthwhile than half-assing them. Progress: 2 weeks in and I can see abs!!! like a decent view  Day 15: this has been the hardest day, I was so sore, but I was REALLY feeling the burn Progress: I can see outlines to a six pack, and my obliques are really popping  Day 16: I was able to do much more than usual, the alternate version of jackknives has really helped I can do more and last the time Progress: I can feel where my abs are coming in and are much more defined from what they were  Day 17: I did every set at least twice, I felt like I was getting somewhere. Progress: Abs feel sore after the workout as they should, I can see decent definition, not yet 6 but getting there  Day 18: Missed  Day 19: I hit hard with doing about 2 of each set, I felt like a break was nice but not needed, I just sinply didn't have time day 18 but I will do a 23rd day Progress: I see the same development  Day 20: I was able to do two sets of each, felt good doing it Progress: seeing development!  Day 21: Did 2 sets of each overall pretty good Progress: same  Day 22: did 2 sets of each again felt pretty good Progress: I didn't gain a six pack but I do definitely have better developed abs, my abs are also way stronger then they were, I highly suggest this routine
Young and doing these
Just finished day 22. My abs are significantly more visible but i still have to reduce belly fat. And yes i reccommend this to anyone.
I’m going to start today and I will give you guys an update each day on how my results are looking so far. Starting Wednesday, March 13, 2019  Wish me luck. Edit Day 2: Sorry for not updating but so far my stomach and ribs are killing me. I feel proud of my self cuz I think it is working🥵 Edit 3: Well I keep on doing this even though it hurts but it is kind of getting easier for me.
Day one: Ouch! More to follow on day two
How much rest should I take between each type of exercise when I can’t do the last one anymore?
Hi ATHLEAN-X  I'm find this video helpful. Thanks. But pliz do a video on how to use the whole week as a routine  to work out all of the body parts. I'm a beginner. Thank you once again. :)
They are all pretty hard, but the jackknifes I’m having a hell of a time with.

Cool workout, I started losing my abs since I haven’t worked them out, but I’ll do this, however i fell everytime I tried to thread the needle and the X crunch was very difficult
Gonna start and will post results on instagram got to keep myself motivated cause my diet is bad but getting abs is just a goal I must get and will get
Dude man there isn't an oz. Of fat on this guy!
Never knew 45 seconds was so long 😂😂🤣
I did this for 22 days and I see oblique definition and mid ab definition like I’ve never seen before! Awesome!
Ok, (i added 50 pushups becauss why not) Day one Did the exercise, 1 set of everything obv no results Day two, i have pain from yesterday, doin 2 sets for some exercises, i fell that i'm working
Hey what’s up Jeff so is 22 days the max or can I go past the 22 days. Could I continue to do this indefinitely btw amazing videos I’ve been following you forever and I’m starting my own journey on YouTube
Am i too strong to do this First exercise i've done 7 sets can't seem to get hypertrophy in 45 seconds i can do this all day
on the jackknife i noticed you had one knee slightly bent and the other straight. which one is better?
I am 15 and haven't trained for a while now the comments here gave me Motivation so I'll try to rock this thing I will start tomorrow 😊 Maybe I'll make a little log about this but I think it would just annoy you guys so I think I won't.

Super brother
"The 22 Day Ab Workout (NO REST!)".  Me: What about sleep and breakfast?
Wow,  those alternating jack knives kicked my butt!    Damn my belly is weak
How many sets a day
If you have will power anywhere above a mediocre athlete, you will work through the pain to the extent this workout will burn you out so badly that you won't be able to recover day after day- let alone for 22 days.
Sir please tells about pectus excavatum exercises
That 22 days is a hoax, it actually takes 66 days to change a habit, so people do this abs challenge for 66 days!
Is there any proper diet plan needed in this 22 days abs schedule ?
Do I only do all these once a day?
Really impressed with this workout especially the "No Equipment" theme.  22 days with tons of business travel means I can do this anywhere/anytime.  Starting today...will follow up on 22 more.  Thanks for your expertise and knowledge.
In exercise 1,2 and 4 there is "if I make it I get another round". How about exercises 3, 5 and 6? Do I get only one round or should I get another as well? I'm not sure if I understood correctly. Thanks in advance for your reply.💪

Jeff u look joocy af
1 Day im able to do first 4 and last 2 urgg.....😑 2 Day im do first 2 exercise but i complete all, ( i think to skip xmencross' exercise😂)
@ATHLEAN-X I've been doing this workout for the last 4 days, I can feel it working out my abs (considering they hurt the next day) but ever since the third day, I've been gagging towards the end of my workouts, I try to push myself to keep going but I know ill throw up if I go any further, so I've been stopping there. Its usually during my jack knives i feel this feeling. Please help me, I need to know if this is normal and also if I should be stopping there (I'm not a big fan of puking)
Awesome
How did you make it look that easu
Very informative and educational as always. But here’s my question- how much cardio is needed to shred the fat around the body? Is lifting and eating right all thats need to get shredded? Sorry for my ignorance but curious because I hear cardio kills muscle growth. Is this true?
ja
I hv started doing gym..its my 1st tym ..but i have not good strength on my arms ..so what can i do gain the strength
Was doing  heels to heaven and faced back ache in lower back how to prevent it???
Jeff I’m 56 my arms are growing and cut...but my D...!!! Abs still have flab😡pls advise Matt Colorado
Is there a rest between rounds?
Does this ab workout also make a awesome body
Nyc bro 💕
I completed this work out and this work out is very hard
We have to do only 1 set of these?? Please tell me quick i want to start from tomorrow
My english is bad. Can anyone tell me how many times i have to do these six exercises a day? Only once? Or how many?
Awesome! Thanks this helps loads!
The resilience of the abs is harder than time itself
The day this dude puts his arms down while talking will be the day i win the lottery
Yada yada yada, man your jaw muscles are huge!
I want lower abs to develop.I see its your weak part also.make a video please
Can 13 to 14 years boy can do workout
Starting this tomorrow, wish me luck!
Dear Jeff, I have L5S1 disc bulge. I did these for 2 days but then i realised that may be these are not for me. Jeff please advice.
Thread the needle just fucking kills me ,its insane.
What's the resting time between the 6 excercises?
1:58 more like heels to the hell
https://youtu.be/09Pf1NJ-c4U Six pack
Day 1 done. Only able 2 see a 4 pack in good lighting. Also doing the 300 ab workout and the 400 bodyweight workout
Is there any rest time between the different workouts?
I can't even do some of these exercises, but I'll keep the principle the same
I aint doin this shit
You won't see improvement if you DONT DO CARDIO AND BURN FAT. Jump roping for ONE hour can burn 1000 calories, and is fucking amazing for melting weight off your body. Proper nutrition, cardio, and exercises similar to these in the video are the 3 absolutely necessary steps to gaining a 6 pack. Don't do just one or two. ALL THREE STEPS. NO EXCUSES.
Since when did Ross from friends become a fitness trainer
Im tracking all 22 days I do, wish me luck  Day 1
Thanks man....my 22 day start today
love this work out !!thank you bro
I’ve just finished day 18 and I still find alternating jack knives the hardest
This ab worked out effed me all up!
Ouch
I’m kind of scared of the x-ups because of shoulder impingement due to a subluxation I suffered in my left shoulder
2nd attempt Day 1 ✔️ Day 2✔️ Day 3✔️ Day 4✔️ Day 5 ✔️ Day 6 ✔️ Day 7 ✔️ Day 8 ✔️ Day 9 ✔️ Day 10 ✔️
Heel to the hell😭😭 Step out plank X man punch😂😂
I will be starting this program tonight. I will keep everyone updated through my first 22 days and hopefully continue on my own after.  Day 1: I completed the workout and damn I’m tired. The thread the needles got me but on most I was able to go to extinction once. Results: none  Day 2: I had some more endurance today and was able to go a bit longer for most exercises. Results: abs are a little more defined but still not much change  Day 3: I’m seeing lots of improvement in my endurance. And yes I still feel the burn after each workout. Results: same as yesterday  Day 4: I’ll say it again this workout is NOT easy. Despite the difficulty I’m seeing improvements in form and endurance. Results: a 4 pack is visible in good lighting and my abs are getting harder to the touch.  Day 5: it’s not too bad now but still hard Results: upper abs are somewhat visible now.  Day 6: I barely got this one in. I had to do it at about 10:30 today. Results: same
I hate Jack Knives...
Omg...  I've done it.. Tis s my day 1.. Will let you know on day 23... Burned 🔥
The last exercise is actually really hard you weren’t  kidding.
I can see Cameraman with white shorts..
Day 1: I worked the abs along my chest and bicep workout.
DAY 1✔ DAY 2✔ DAY3✔ DAY4✔(No rest boys) DAY5✔ DAY6✔ DAY7✔
On day three 😩
Do you take Steroids
Day 1 ✓ (hey this workout is actually fun) Day 2 ✓ Day 3 ✓
Love it! Thank❤️🙏🏽
Day 1: Done  Results: none  Day 2: Done Results: None  Day 3: Done Results: none  Day 4: Done Results: Abs gotten hard and visible under good lighting
It was a great ab workout
i love the first 70 seconds
The amount of people in the comments section talking about how they don't see results after 22 days. Bro you need to reduce your body fat to at least 15% to see abs. Just be patient. Don't give up

..
I tried this workout at 215lbs. Struggled. Kinda got discouraged. Got my cardio up and weight down to 190lbs thru sprints. Now i can do multiple sets til extinction. Cutting weight is definitely better before u begin this 22 day. Day 1 bitches!
Nice
Day 1 ✅ Day 2 ✅ Day 3 ✅
I’ll be back in 22 days. I hope you actually believe in this I weigh 165 IB 6’2”. Next I’ll be working on pecs if you have a video already I’d like a link if not you should make one.
Excuse me, what is the recommendation you would give me for the best management of your app?
Thank you sir for these exercises it helped me a lot
Sir no budget from jim 😢
I normally go to the gym 5/6 days every week i do alot of cardio and weights at the gym. I changed my diet up cause im trying to build muscle more than just loose weight.   This will help me keep track of my 22day 6pack challenge  Day 1: man this exercise kinda hurts but it was a great quick workout. ✅  Day 2: so today i double up on time towards each exercise i feel it in my stomach ✅  Day 3: made it through the work out except the planks i double my time on each✅  Day 4: ✅  Day 5:✅  Day 6:✅  Day 7:✅ double up doing this twice a day  Day 8: ✅  Day 9:✅ i dont see much difference in my stomach yet  Day 10: ✅💯  Day 11: ✅  Day 12:✅  Day 13:✅  Day 14:✅  Day 15:✅  Day 16: coming tomorrow
Convert 45 sec time into 12 Reps and 30 sec time into 10 Reps if u dont wanna mess with the stopwatch like me 😅
Approx. after 2 years im here to restart my abs mission
i dont get it i feel like I can do heels to the heavens for a long time then get fatigued to the point I cant do any other exercise. Its 45 secs until you give in right? On each exercise?
you are the real deal Jeff. I enjoy all of your videos, you are very knowledgeable and are in serious natural shape !
Thanks for all the videos Jeff they are great!. Is this more for building abs or just for getting into a workout routine and maybe getting more lean?
Xman crunch is terribly hard
Day: 1 ✅
Good workout man thanks a lot thanks a lot
Day 1: Abs sore as hell no results yet. Tops 2 abs showing a tiny bit.  Day 2: sore but still working hard yesterday my top 2 abs were showing a little but now they seem more defined.  Day 3: lighting might've been different in day 2 when I was looking. Really no results yet, besides not being as sore as days before.  Day 4 no results  Day 5 no results  Day 6 no results but my arm training is working really well!  Day 7 I see 2 abs slowly coming in, my intestinal v is starting to become rigid too.
I will try bro....
How many sets do we do this because I did it and it seemed short.
I workout everyday ima give this a try worth he abb workouts I already do
I thought it took 67 days to make a habit
I thought abs need to recover like any other muscle?

Hay please make a video on fat loss
X is the best athlate trainer ever
That skeleton in the background is me on Day 23
Whats the break in between sets recommended????
Are we supposed to do it for 22 days straight? Because I thought we had to give our muscles rest to allow it to grow and recover.
how old is this guy
Every time i reached extinction was because of my back
Day 1: ☑️ (2,5/1,5 etc means how many times I did every exercise, like 2,5 in 1st one is 45 secs+ 45 + 22,5) 1: 2,5 2: 0,5 3: 3 times, last one 10 reps. 4: 0,7 (30 secs) 5: 1,5  6: 1,5 (neck really hearts)  Really bad in plank-ish exercises, arms hurts so bad, just fell down in 2 and 4 exercise. Hopefully, here will be daily updates Day 2: ☑️ Day 3: ☑️
I’ve only truly been following him for a few weeks but already I am starting to see promise. It’s not much nor should it be but it is light at the end of a tunnel.
Thanks for video ,  I see this video after 35 days and now I have best and strong six packs abs💪💪💪💪
Looks like a ripped Messi
When it comes to core and abs, I consider myself a beginner. My workout routine, that I'm just starting, calls for two days of ab circuit training where you do 3 different ab/core exercises. I was looking for variation, so I don't end up just targeting one area. This video gives me a great (additional) list to grab from. Thanks so much for this video!
I'm getting poping in my neck what should I do
Any before and after pictures?
Do you have a Abs plan for you AX1 program?
Day 1 ✔
Im going to try this
Nice bro
1st day  It was difficult my arms started bleeding  Results:none  2nd day  I couldn't even stand up from my bed; My body was so hurt. I got sick and couldn't breathe at all. Results:none  3rd day My body hurt again I got headaches and didn't want to eat. Results: I could see a line forming  4th day Back to school... I did more than before but I could see a difference Results: a line
I will start tomorrow..
Put a tennis ball under your chin.  Makes you work the muscles instead of your neck
Starting today, will let you guys know about the progress after 22 days. Wish me luck.
Can we do abs exercise daily because I heard that abs need 48hours to recover please do reply.
U speak with our hands a lot , lol
Well...can do around 3 for each of these moves. Hopefully I can get more in every day. Won't know if I don't try :/ Love your vids & learning so much from you, thank you.
make a video for excercises for a beginner in a gym.. i think it will help many
Does anyone have any tips for feeling it more in your arms than your abs in some of the exercises?
Super
Took me 6 years to realize that Jeff and I have the same physique structure with his being more developed than mine OFC.
How are you supposed to overcome muscle pain if you repeat this every day?
Safe & effective
How much body fat we need
Am I doing something wrong if oblique exercises hurts around the bottom of my rib cage or is that actually where they are?
Video stats at 1:50 , Thank me later ..

Doesn't he looks like Silver Fang from One Punch Man🤔
The skeleton went to extinction 💅
Jeff I love the stuff you share man.  Thank you!  I've been hitting the 7 minute abs I'll see if I can hit them in morning and do this at night.  Would that be over training tho?

I'm going to do this for 22 days and comment my progress everyday!
I did this and im12
Jeff are you recommending this workout to be performed everyday?
I was looking at his biceps all the time
Great workout, except that thread the needle has my shoulders sounding like rice krispies.
66 days to develop a habit...
Just finished the 22nd day and I don’t have a complete 6 pack but my abs are definitely more defined and I feel a TON stronger!!! I’m gonna keep going!!!
D A Y 2 2 LETZ GOOOO
Day 21
I am at 11.6 % body fat my goal is 10% I weigh 137.4 as of now,  I am going to do these workouts and I’ll update everyone on how everything goes and on the results starting tomorrow

Legend says Jeff is still repeating first exercise
Has anyone else had sucess with the workout? Please let me know!
I am definitely going to put this to my routine, please do make similar videos for chest and biceps
Day 20
Day 19
So you can get abs for 22 days?
Photosynthesis is the xman workout lmao
I've been with althenx for about an year now I'm going to say this is the best about work out I've ever seen for my 3 year work out career.🤣💪
He is disgusting. Why would you wanna look like that?
hey ya'll! check out his phone app for ab workouts... it has day rests and a different routine for each day... so maybe if you want something different... this routine above is very efficient but i learned about his app 3 days ago and have been doing that instead just skipping the rest days... there's a diet plan, place where you can take selfies for progress, etc... pretty cool. thank you athleanx... you make me burn,. i've been a little sore in the midsection everyday for about a week now. ha
Play this on the slowest speed, and you'll find out what Jeff probably sounds like when he's drunk.
My favorite thing about this channel is excuse elimination, making it easy for anybody to follow your program
this is actually so fucking good
Day 18
I memorized it today so now I don’t have to look at this video everyday
Day 17
If your skinny already like me its going to be easy for your abs to show cause of our low body fat
Stop flexin then $9 steroids 😐
This is the best abs exercise even my gym trainer has started following this and its very helpful thank you @athleanx keep posting such videos !!
I cant grt the angle for the 6th one its hard
I wish I could "like" this more then once, boutta make another account lmao. Gains here I come!
Im gonna do this challenge start today,support me pls and i will update the result daily
suppp
Day 16
The time 5:05 is my face right now
Day 7 and I'm already getting good results. I used to jog (6-8km per day) and do stretching exercices before but my abs were visible, I just had a flat stomach, these exercises concentrate on burning calories only in your abdomen region so you will get abs doing this, but you have to do other exercises to get ripped.
Day 1: I added HLRs to this. This workout was brutal, thank you!
Great suggestion buddy.
You are the best
I’m on day 15 and I feel amazing❗️ Keep going❗️ It’s worth it❗️
Day 15❗️
I did this for 25 days straight and then tore my ACL. Thanks Jeff!
Day 14 2 weeks in!!! Can’t stop now
How many sets do for all excercise
yeah those are good. thank you jeff!!! this routine is the most efficient ab exercise i have found yet. my ENTIRE midsection burns after this... very nice
Day 13 😤😤😤😤
Looks like I'm starting this tomorrow after school. For reference, I am 16 and my abs are far from visible in any lighting. I am what one might call "skinny fat," but more "fat" than "skinny." I'll log my journey below and hopefully I can get some solid gains. Good luck everyone.
Thank you i been looking for a video like this 😃👍🏻
Have a wedding to attend... Going to give this am honest shot!
Starting my 22days today I’ll see you on 1/30/19
i was on the day 9 of doin this and got hit by a car last night but still won't quit 💪🏽 Motivate me !
Day one done
Day 12 Ten more boys
Now this is a kick-ass ab workout for strength! --> https://youtu.be/bTP8Nd5jsBM
Why is Jeff holding 2 fingers in one hand and 1 in the other?😂
How much rest do you have between the exercices?
Day 11
Day 10
Day 9
My husband and I are giving this a try. I'll send an update in 22 days!
Jeff is the best!
From abs: 1:57  2:47  3:21  4:02  4:56  5:32
1. abs are useless in your life 2.legs are very usefull in the apocalypse if horde of walkers follow you you will can run fast  3. hands are the best because you can push a walker and kill him super easy
I like your videos. I just have a question. One you said that abs workout should be more than 10 minutes. But if we sum up all 6 of this exercises with 45 seconds in every set, seems like it surpasses more than 10 for most of the guys. At least for me it is. Love you videos <3
14 yr old boys can do it?
Adding Extension round to my daily vocabulary
HMMM....   Average days to build a habit = 22 Athlean-X Servings in Preworkout = 22
thanks
Day eight
Just got my butt handed to me by Day 1.  Hit extinction on every exercise except for the X-man Crunch, which I just barely managed to make 12 reps on.  My gut and lack of overall flexibility didn't make the step through plank very easy, but every exercise had my core begging for mercy which is exactly what I need to burn off all this goo I've accumulated since the fall. I don't expect the miraculous appearance of a 6-pack in the next 3 weeks, but I'm hoping to at least get rid of my gorilla belly before my vacation. 21 days to go...
Day 1 guys I managed to do multiple sets of the first 2 then my strength kinda left me as I went the hardest was definitely the 5th exercise for me but will keep u all updated
Starting this today!
What is the boyfatlevel of the guy behind you? He so lean
Is everyday high intensity training recommended for abs? or do you need rest.
DAY 7 week 1 down
I have personally done this last winter and was shocked at the results. Went from seeing an outline box to 8 abs being viable. I recommend this to all!
Ok. I've just checked this out & i gotta admit, I'm gonna give this a go but I'm gonna pace myself. For me it's more common sence than vanity. Yes i wanna look good but I also wanna feel good at the same time. So if it takes me more than 22 days...I can deal with that. #4REAL💯😎👌
damn i messed up that thread and needle. oh well tomorrow i'll do it again.
Day 6 Let’s goooooo
Starting today. I'll update you guys tomorrow!
I'm active, I have a flat stomach, but I've never had "abs," or even that middle line. I'm going to give this a try. Wish me luck. :D
Very helpful sir tried for first time destroyed my abs
Day 5
Done this after leg's workout ABS are cramping during this workout any solutions?
Day 4
God dam were can i get roids in houston
Okay everyone! I’m going to do a 22 day workout. And I’m not bullshitting this. I’m actually going to do it.  Day one:
Day 3 in the books 📚 📚 📚
i wanna ask u something ..whether this abs workout effect chest or biceps because we ectomorph peopl work hard to get this !!!
Thanks for the routine. I would like to know more about your diet. A great ab workout cannot outrun a poor diet.
Day 2 😤😤😤
Great workout. Just add HIIT to this workout and you WILL get some abs.
someone else hurts his back doing alternative jack knives?
Im gonna do this from today.  DAY#1 this workout wasnt that intense. I could 1 workout straight for 5 minutes without stopping and i couldnt get to failiure cos they were so easy
Just finished day 1.... let’s get this boys!!!
Did anyone notice that he looks like Matthew McConaughey ?
Excellent for middle aged men. Very informative and helpful. Not enough stuff like this on the Net. Upbeat, supportive and encouraging. Many thanks!
This is great, thank you!!

Has anyone tried this and it rlly works? Its difficult these days to sort through which workout routine is actually workjng
Wait so do you do this for once a day and then youre done for the day or do you do it continouisly for 22 days
I am gonna start to do this from tommorow anyone with me will post the results everyday
Now i will do this for next 22 days n update every day
You make it look so easy
What model Nike's? I like them.
Seems easy!! But one will get kicked out once to start off with this workout
it worked
Morning work out
Tweaked my neck on day 3... guess I’ll give up now
21 days to build a habit 90 days to create a lifestyle
nys broo  ill do it 21 day workout
Less then 20 seconds after this workout my mom got home with a box of pizza
But I do life the overall exercise
I feel extinction is a good idea but I got bored of the first exercise after like 9 rep of 45 seconds
Day 2, will update daily if I don’t #roastmyass #bebrutalaf
So much harder then then i just think  about these exercises but that was very helpful i improve my abs
👍💪
Did it work?
what if you got loose skin
Its good
the 21 days to pick up a habit thing is BS. A plastic surgeon came up with that when his patients needed around 21 days to get used to their new faces. good video though
I'm gonna start today. And update each day! Day: 1 heels to the haven 4 reps😀 Step out plank 1 rep😔 X- man 24 Needle- 2 reps Jack:2 reps Staysnary: 4 reps
@ATHLEAN-X - is this video for women as well and could you please post a video for tricep fat reduction workout?
If a nuclear bomb went off, two things would survive problem free: 1) Cockroaches.  And 2) Jeff's abs.  I'm doing this and dragging my wife with me!!!  Thanks Jeff!!!
How long to wait till I can do the next exercise?
Starts tomorrow.
seems freaking hard because you have to reach the point where you just can't anymore, for each individual exercise here :\ ...wow ok. Dedication required I guess..
1:53 OK I'm doing it: Day 1 Done Day 2 Done Day 3 Done 4:47 Most difficulty 5:30 Shit I'm weak (alternative= crunch position twist your hips 20x)
The alternating jack knife looks like a crunch pretty much.. which you said in your 6 pack abs series was not a good idea... we should go for stretching the abs and not crunching... I'm in that 15% body fat range looking to hit that 10% and beyond.. mostly looking for the 6 pack and whatever goes with it.. I don’t mind doing whatever will work basically and I’m sure every exercise helps when its done.. Just trying to make sure I spend my time wisely ...the first time.. It sucks working and working on something and then come to find out that you could have spent your time a little wiser for better results.. Thanks Jeff.. awesome videos as always... You should make a mind muscle connection video... I'm thinking it would almost look like a mediation video... Game on!!
Does anyone else have shoulder pain during the plank-based exercises? If so, have tips to alleviate the pain or develop shoulder strength?
When I do these exercises my joins just pop
What if i make it a regular workout
Starting tomorrow wish me luck
How many sets ?
What are the food not to eat
या इट्स गुड exercise नमस्कार
What if you have a belly can we still do this to burn or do we stick to cardio workouts only
This workout is no joke, by the time i got to the no legs bicycle my wheels were flat.
It's breaking up my muscles
How many times we need to do ?
It’s 66 days but ok..
Cool man
Iloveyouuuu
This is a great work out I haven’t done it yet but the concept is well worth it
"wHitE pEopLe aRe wEaK"   Look this man hes white and ever strong most white men and power lifers
Are you sure that you will be in 22 days.??
Good one💕 ..But I have a doubt..won't it cause problem by doing the same muscle till 22 day without rest??

Awesome
All of this is bullshit, here is how to get 6 packs for real: https://kit.com/Oversails/cheap-how-to-get-6-packs-in-3-weeks-legit
I just have a question am i doing it 1 time a day or 2 times?  Thx for this btw
Today is Day 21 for me so I have just 1 day left. I still have more body fat to lose to get visible abs but I'm getting close. One huge benefit I'm noticing already in just 3 weeks is that my squat (especially front squat) feels way more solid and stable. My core is more sturdy and allowing me to hold a more upright posture as I reach the bottom of my squat. I plan on continuing the routine beyond the 22 days but this was a great way to develop the habit! Thanks for the great tips!
I train in 1 month with no balance diet some times i eat once a day... Is that good.. I have loseweigh but i feel that .. I dont have energy.. Is this good for me.. See my body transformation 1 month... If i continue this rutine Will it give side effect on me.. Like over skin https://youtu.be/DkoLB7wZbUw
I’m a 16 year old male, what would you guys think would be okay to eat with this workout (I have a fast metabolism so I can eat a horse and stay ripped) lol but if I eat healthy this might show progress faster
I got exactly 22 days.
finished day 4, protrusion is the only thing bothering me but i can literally feel the results of stronger core when i wake up.
How long should be the breaks in between?
Please exercise in teenege 17 what exercises
Excellent gona try it i definatly need some kind of work out being a truck driver its hard to get any where so ya i can spend up to an hour a day doin this!!
How we loss fat fast for 6 packs
So I really do have to ask, as a personally trainer, do you actually intend for this to be done forever? because this is a lot of volume. (minimum 6 sets daily, minimum 42 sets weekly). it would probably be fine if done for only 22 days, but if you truly intended for one to make it a habit, wouldn't they quickly become overtrained and regress? how many weekly sets of direct ab training do you do jeff?
My lower backs killing me with these ab workouts, but i just keep telling myself it’ll pay off in the long run.
Do you need to do warm up cardio?
5ft 6in 190. Adding this to a cardio challenge & I will finish!
this is what i'm looking for hahaha
What exercises would you recommend for the chest (no equipment/s)?
Equipment I miss is abs
Day1.       Comment will be edited after 22 days
Any Indian watching
This is a great addition to my program.  I have done it for a week adding it to my current lifting program and calorie deficit and can already begin to tell a big difference in aesthetics, performance, and strength.
Bro talk to hindi
Sir can we get our belly back from 6 pack abs
Kitna pravachan deta hai yr...😬😬😬😬
Jeff please give us a 22 day chest workout
I like it sounds good
Awesome!! I'm gonna try it!!
wait how many x men crunches do we do?
Will this work for women + a high protein diet?
Starting on monday!
4:27 - if you can do 10 reps great, you've just turned yourself into another 10 reps. 😅 that's why I love your videos and advises! You want to see the result - Do it or die. And if you won't die today, then do more tomorrow and you'll die tomorrow. 🤣😂 will challenge myself for the next 22 days. 🙂👍👍👍
Love this work out thanks alot for sharing ur expertise
No rest is the right way always
Dude it's really cool that you you do things like this you really you inspired me thanks
To anyone who has done this: with how many sets did you start out, how many could you complete after the 22 days and what changes have you experienced
The first one is so hard 😅😅
I literally can't do any jack knives. My body doesn't move... (is there maybe an exercise to strengthen just that specific part of my abdomen?). Everything else was great, thanks.
Just 1 set? I didn't catch how many he said.
Blessed way of working out. Keeping working out to extinction (aka failure). Put in the effort till you can't anymore, and you have success for that exercise. 😁😁😁
Great idea. Wanna get my summer bod ready
He just talks waaaaay too much and too quickly. So not a good way to teach/ learn.
22 year old overweight male. Wasn't expecting to see abs because I need to lose fat but I've noticed some definition in my obliques (which in turn has made my love handles less noticeable) and upper abs (mind you I have a fat belly). No doubt, my core has become much stronger. I remember my first 2 weeks of this I just could not do the last exercise. Now I can do it for 30 seconds! Also keep in mind I haven't even done this the full 22 days straight but have been doing it at least 3-4 times per week.
So yeah I’m 12 and trying this I’ll keep y’all updated.  Day 1: Absolutely no abs
Patle hone ki exercise

Ok. Day 1. I'm having some balance problems with the 2nd and 4th exercise, but I managed to do at least one series of each exercise. Will try again tomorrow and the next 21 days.
It is possible to get abs in 22days
I love extinction training...I don't have a program cuz I'm poor
Your waist band is so low we can almost see your pubes.
is this better or 7 mins abs workout better?
Some good exercises there, many thanks.  I was after some new abs routines and these fit the bill perfectly.  Time to hit the gym.  Age 51 and as feeling good.  😀
Which is better this or the 7 minute ab workout 6 pack promise, another one of his Ab videos
Athlean X official app should come soon, please sir 😌🙃
Thanks Dad!
Dude I feel the burn. Good help I gotta get my shit in shape. Thanks
That jack knife can fuck off. Lol
Dawg this shit is advanced, I couldn’t even do half the exercises
these hurt my back alot, i suffer from the back pain and not ab workout fatigue. Am i doing these wrong or am i weak or is their something wrong with my back??
In English athlean X and in hindi guru Mann is the best in this field
Why  in comment all of you show your knowledge ,except this you should tell that it works or not..    Dont show your knowledge...
Ok im going to try this
Ok, i did this workout for less than 2 months  and i "noticed" mid way that i already had the abs while contracting them...the workout allowed me to do more and at some point even do exercices i couldn't when i started...however, the abs were just not showing so i tried to watch my diet to see where it would lead me and i can now have a glimpse of the abs without contracting. I'm pretty sure i could get better results with having a tougher diet but i decided to stick with a "soft" diet, meaning that i won't starve, i get some treats but less than before and no soda (forever).  Just so you know : this workout will help you with if you have no abs at all or to get some strengh and stability (i certainely gained that) but i think the really deal is what's after the 22 days, it is exactly as he said, after 22 days, i kept going to the gym and i won't stop until my deadline which is March 2019, i have dropped the ab workout  for now and i'm focusing with the upper body because i never skipped legs day.   Keep training!
U talk to much
I’m doing this every day now for 22  days
To everyone who has been trying this routine out. This is a great program but it is generalized for all. You should not be expecting to see exposed abs; results are vary depending upon your body. This routine is great if you have already been doing the work and have a lean body ratio. You should add a variety of workouts to get the best result. If I could add a few more exercise, it would be pullup bar routine.   Doing pullup not only work out your arms and shoulders it will also work your abs.
Do I do this every day for 22 days
Day 1: gt stuck on jacknife!
Okay you do a lot of training for the guys what about the girls I'm at about 10% body fat and I'm trying to get abs when Trish is on point my workouts on point
Shall we do this for 22days regularly without any day for rest ??
Amazing!!! I will be doing this challenge
Wtf does extinction time mean?
So can you train your abs for 22 days straight without overtraining?
day 1 lol
Been training at home for 4 months + 9 months at the gym. I can see 7 of my abs, but only when i contract them. i'll try Jeff's 6 pack abs app.  5 times a week ab workout, for 8 weeks.  After that, i'll do maybe a week deload and then this challenge for 22 days. Comment bere below to ask for updates :D
You the best dude. I like your videos
Which food should i cut down when i want to build up abs?
The exercises u suggested require a lot of balance. So shud we just practice these or get some other exercises for balance?
So I had to Google about sets and reps So am I beginner 😂😂
Great training it has amazing results!
I started this work out. 1st day, did all 6 without REST on mentioned time and reps once. How many times should i need to do these 6 exercises for a day?
Gonna start them from tomorrow.
Hi Jeff. One serious question here.  Most people advise not to work out on abs daily. Do compound exercise which will stimulate your abs too and try twice or thrice a week for abs. I want to focus on my abs only for  now cause I want athletic body. In this case, what should I do ?
giving it a try
Great abs exercise men..  Great help for everybody who wants to have a good abs exercise
Why the hell am I getting fucking TikTok ads.
Best fitness youtuber..... Love from india
Every time I watch Jeff's videos, I tend to miss what he's saying 'cause my eyes keep locking on to those biceps!! 🙄
did this on day 1, sweating like a dog, thanks alot jeff :)
shit
I need help setting up my diet I’m 161 and trying to loose my belly fat I can feel my abs I just need to get rid of that belly fat I’ve been reasearching and some people suggest low carb diet and others a high carb diet so what do I do I’m clueless
Who actually wants to look like that? gross
I've been doing this for 22 days now, and it really did become a routine. I can do 3 sets of all the excersises now and I'll just keep on going. I can see the sixpack, and all other abdominal muscles with pretty nice def. But most of all, I feel way better about this routine then all other ab excersises I ever did. This really hits all the muscles and drives you to extinction! Awesome!  Only head's up: Make sure you do these excersises the right way, like exactly how it's shown by Jeff, because if you don't you'll end up with injuries.
It takes me 7 years to finish primary school...
Completed 22 days! It did help me in making my abs flatter! Gonna continue ....
DAY 1 tomorrow (tadadadum-taduuuuuuuuuuuum!!!)
Going to try this
Gonna do this. Now I need to stop eating pizza and drinking soda. 😭
tried this workout, it's fire!!!!! 8th day and still grinding!!
it ends just by one set ?
I feel my abs getting tighter just watching this video
Are all of them 10 second rests?
Hey Jeff love your Chanel.here is my problem I have a lower disc problem so I get a lot of pain from leg raises and if I do squats with bar weights that is challenging I thro my back out.  end up in chiropractor at least once a month . Got any suggestions too fix my back ..maybe build muscle in that area to compensate ???
Tommorow I will began this challenge and I will keep you guys updated. Just to let you know im 13
This actually worked! I got abs! It isn't as significant as him, however, an improvement from "not having abs at all" to "having abs when I contract it even when I was very full" is an accomplishment. Yes I am skinny because I am still a teenager. Teenagers are usually slender (not skinny!) FFMI estimation: 16.4 (Yeah not that muscular, but good enough)
Jeff, thanks for this video however; my challenge is I can only get my upper part of my shoulder blades lifts from the floor. I have tried. I used fit before but hurt my back, so now I find it hard to do sit-up. So for the jackknife and the X-men what can I do instead or will just lifting the shoulder blades from the floor is alright.  I await your reply. Pam
Damn this is my first day... only able to survive the first 3 exercises
The problem with the Step through plank and Thread the needle is that my arms are going to let go earlier than my abs.
Just brilliant Jeff. Much appreciated.
How do i do this without straining my neck? My neck hurt when doing number 3 to 6 :(
Hello brother Make Hindi language video
all right i'll give this one a try ... here i go ...
my god..i can only about one and half sets before moving to the next exercise lol
I'll be trying this vs normal 2/3 ab work outs every other day, this is going to be some beautiful pain
did the leg raising on floor shirtless... my back made fart like noises.. 😐
I am a 13 year old male. I have a weight of 100 lbs/ 44 kilos. I hate my weight and my strength. I also am short. 5' 1". Its not about losing weight for me it is replacing fat with muscle. I hope this works out. Tomorrow is the first day i am doing this. Thank you.  Edit: I was a dumbass and did it on concrete. All my bones hurt like hell but I am keeping up with it
My roommate and I started this on October 1st for our monthly challenge, so we’re currently on day 4. Gotta say, I’m liking it so far. Kicking my ass hahaha
Nyc.  Who want abbs
How much time between the different sets?
I'm a kid! but I have silipide
I love his exercise😍
Is working ur abs everyday ok ..? Your muscles don’t need a rest period ? Like wth weight lifting ..
Hi Jeff, I have been following you for couple of months. With your workout I’m getting results which I never got before. So thank you for sharing these video. I have a question though, whenever I do abs workout, I get cramps even after 3-4 reps. Could you suggest me something so I can strengthen my abs? Thanks a million in advance.
I'll see you all in 22 days.
Is there like a rest period between each exercise or....?
I Sometime I have shoulder issues and the thread the needle bothers me. Will Russian twists be a good substitute for obliques + adding weight and going to extinction?
Pure crap
So its ok to work your abs everyday?
Hey Jeff you are a legend love the advise and its really genuine and beneficial can you try this for me i find it an absolute murder for my abs 20 x normal abs full crunch with knees bent straight into 20 x leg raises  straight into 20 x slow crunch without moving away from the area of pressure on the abs meaning not all the way down or all the way up  45 sec break and 3 sets  its something i wanted to ask about for some time just wanted to know your thoughts
The problem with this is that i would spend hours doing theese. I can't seem to find something to challenge me...and i'm tire of spending so much time on abs only every day...
please makevideos inHindi lengveg
I'll do it starting tomorrow... hope to complete it and meet my expectations .
Jeff whats fees of ur gym per month...
Are we supposed to do many sets of these?
Awesome. I literally paused and tried evey single ab workout
I'm gonna give it a shot
I will practise these exercises in the morning. Thank you very much..
I can see a skeleton behind who did for 22 day!! He lost all his fat lol
Sir please show me the knock nee exercises plezz help me
I am a karate fighter, I practice hard for abs but not getting a perfect visible abs , when I compress my abdominal then it is visible , tell me how to make it perfectly visible
Can a 15 years old guy do it?

#therealmfdeal!!! Thank You!!!
Those some nice sweatpants, where can I get a pair?
Everyday?
This guy gives out great advice, great demos, simplified explanations & motivation all for free and yet there are 4.2k twats who have disliked this video. They’re probably the ones sitting on the their couch with a kfc bargain bucket that’s why.
Why didn't I think of these before...
Question: Should i drink my Protein Shake before or after working out? Or does it not matter? I recently started to hit the gym, just curious. tia
nice video
Would love to hear some advice on diabetes.
For some reason I can do 2 to 3 extinctions of everything else, but I can only get through 20 seconds of Jack knives.  Any advice/modifications?
i am trying this for the first tim at the gym.. but it is so difficult to watch my timer on my watch and keep track of these excercises.. how am i going to do this right i cant tell when the 45 sec are over 😣 ill get there eventually
Can i play those in back days ??
Hi Jeff - I recently tore my MCL so, naturally, it's been hard for me to get to the gym and/or do some of my usual exercises at home. Is there any exercises/workouts you would recommend to keep my upper body in shape while my knee recovers? Thanks so much, you're by far the best training channel on YouTube.
Hi guys! I'll be starting this tomorrow after my usual workout. I'm committed to develop those 6 packs for the first time in my 18 years. If you like i will post a before and after picture, and keeping track of my progress in the comment section. Wish me luck!
Please make a video on side fat too ..
Jeff but how about the recovery? Won't abs recover that much if keep training them everyday?
Is it ok to do this even though there is a little belly?
Starting this today
Alright how ever don't do this that's not good because I'm 12 and I do this daily
After Jeff dies, all Jesus pics will have him vd 8 pack abs. 😃😃
I’m still a skinny dude....maybe, unless if I do 44 days...
I started today I am gonna tell you the results a few months later
do you not have to give your muscles time to repair?
Jeff What about working the back and the calves (Yes calves) I read years ago in Men's Health that to help with flat belly you must work those two areas. Is that true because No one is saying this now.
Quite easy😊😊not d leval of Jeff
Haven’t had the time to do these everyday due to being a working student, but I’ve done them for most of the last two weeks and already seeing results! Awesome workout!
Dude you are nuts but it works no pain no gain
Okay, i saw this from another guy and now i am write notes everyday  Day1= i did 4,4,5,1,5,5 of them with order today and seems to be ripping, i drunk a lot of water. I am 16 and have been exercising everyday for 1.5 years now, i lost a lot of weight but dont have abs yet i do not believe this one will give abs but it most deffinettly is more tiring, lets see...  i'll update
34 day passed omg i got my belly hard 1 month more to get aps😍😍😍
After 22 days i will  be back here and if i don't  have them.... oooooh  who knows!
i got a subway ad before the video started
You should also make gif for people who had watched your videos and only want to see the exact exercise position  later.
Wow f-in amazing
lmao he makes thread the needle look like nothing , when i did that shit it was different
I am 13 years old.Can I build abs?
Srarts at 1:48
Biceps work out plan kindly sent
The end of the world will be caused due to the bursting of jeffs biceps
OMG 😍
I made my six pack abs in just 6 weeks with one of the good technique, low budget, see the 6 week update - http://bit.ly/2QCIph9
I just can't make those alternative jack knifes. Those are so hard.
So you can workout abs everyday. Good to know
Starting tomorrow. Let's try it!
thank you very much jeff
Fast fat burning tip and technique, please?  Is it correct to say that I need to burn/loose the fat before building/focusing on shape?
Beautiful channel subbed you no 6.1m just do back the same and stay connected 👌 👌 👌
Shouldn't abs be able to rest, just like any other muscle group?
Love you
I'm Definitely gonna try this
I've never had a better shoulder workout than 3 rounds of thread the needle lol
Your body is so hot! Damn! Look better without tattoos! ( no homo, im straight)
People who can do these probably already have insane abs....
Will start these exercises today! Tnx Jeff!!!
What a shame that he has such a great channel but still can't afford a shirt
What do I do after 22 days? Rinse and repeat?
Any advice if your tailbone gets bruised and uncomfortable shortly after starting these?
Why i fail so hard at jack knives
Here’s a tip stop watching fucking videos and start working out
Super mem nice
The fifth one killed me  I look like a tortoise turned upside down :')
Should I use the same order everytime? I am always able to do 2 to 3 sets of the first exercise but cant even do full 1 of any of the rest after that
Wow over 9M views and only less than 300k likes . Lots of week people in this world, for free advice from Jeff, all you got to do is leave a thumbs up as an appreciation.
if heels to the heavens is lower abs how come i feel it in my top ab
I just finished doing my ab training! It was very brutal! My whole midsection is burning!
Ohsum
clorox bleach here i'm on day six. already feeling stronger abs day 1 went fine but days 2,3,4 were hard day five i did it at night and felt great not seeing major results even with dieting
Amazing exercise
My core started paining by just seeing this
My core started paining by just seeing this
For some of these exercises I can't keep my feet off the ground, it just wants to lower down and be on the floor. I have to out like half of my focus on it just to keep it straight and off the ground. Anyone knows what is it happening?
guys i started 10days ago..i did each one exercise till i reached failure...and now my 4 abs are visible..just waiting for lower abs to pop out..😀
Can even a kid do this abs workout?
I work at a small gym in my hometown of Northern California, and surely, I am learning so much more, by watching Jeff’s videos, damn sticking to these exercises ain’t easy.
Ok...i will try..all these exercises.. tomorrow
This is an awesome Ab workout day 1✅
This is true please answer my question in comment box
Sincere question here. Can anyone explain why abs need no rest day like other parts?
8 days gone could not burn any fat im really upset😥😫😥
Wonderful abs workouts. I am going to start tomorrow.
I’m going to start this today going to to say the results (I’m a girl btw)
Hey, I always seem to have back pain when leg raises are involved. Am I doing it wrong, or is this a common issue?
What’s the best or most comparable alternative to threading the needle? It’s not intense enough for me. Same for the planks.
Really want to do this but want to know  if this will work even if someone has a layer of belly fat, can you please tell me if this will help even with belly fat?
This Idea is a revolution.....
I love your videos man. Thanks for motivating me and teaching me so much
Good
i am 163 cm...and i've joined gym 9 weeks ago. I have gained weight from 48 to 53 in these 9 weeks and now i want to make abs.. Can i do this while gaining weight simultaneously.. Please answer me..
I’m going to begin this 22 day process as soon as I’m done typing this comment. I’ll update you guys through this comment reply section. After every day, I’ll reply to this comment if i’m seeing any progress! Wish me luck!
can girls do this workout🤨
Got to try this!
Starting today 💪 i really was searching for something like this, hope to get to the end
I would like to kill myself over these, but most of these exercises really do a number on my neck. Any suggestion?
What happens when you reach extinction? Do you rest or just jump right into the next exercise?
Good video
How much rest time?
Belly fat  reducing video
On day 5 feeling good already looking a lil better 🤘
I will decide whether to like or dislike after doing this for 22 days.
Really good exercise
You look like you've had steroids pumped into you from age 4.  How much do you go to the gym, your biceps are insane
Well I have APT does any of this excersise make it worse?
its so usefull Sir, just started the 22day ab work out. and the shoulder widening.
Hey man you are a great motivator for me. thanks
Do you take a break between each of the 6 different exercises, or is it still 10 seconds between each exercise? I get out of breath after some of these exercises and have to take a 1-2 minute break between them. Total time around 25 minutes for me to get through all 6 exercises. Also, do you do this exercise before or after chest/leg day routines? I haven't been to the gym in 10 years until starting at home a few weeks ago, so I'm completely out of shape right now. This is the best ab exercise I've ever done by the way.
ok so i thought i had decent abs for being a beginner, and i went through just 1 round of this workout and it totally kicked my ass. thank you Jeff
Talk less work more!!
What if i cannot do exercise 5 at all?
Will it hurt my back?
What’s the best nutrition plan for abs? Idk my body fat but I’m lowkey skinny fat but not too fat like I got sorta hard stomach but I can’t see any ab lines yet
is it true that you cannot eat junk food when you are on a journey with doing this workout? Because I really want to know if i can grind out this workout every day while still eating junk food such as chips, coke, donuts, etc. If we cant eat it can you please explain why? Thanks in advance
I used to workout daily and run and now that I haven't been in the gym or done anything for over 1.5 years I want to have a great body again. Tried a few about work outs in the past would be nothing but damn it hurts now doing the same.  **So switching to this guy** Will give updates every two days and what I eat to on a normal basis.
How old is jeff?
These videos are extremely helpful thanks so much keep up the good work
does anyone else find it hard keeping your legs of the floor?
I am nearing the end of 22 days non stop....what next?
Can’t go longer than 25 secs and 10 secs in x man
just started it, wish me luck.  One questoin though: i thought, muscles need about 3 days to recover. Does it make sence to do this exercise every day?
Wow this is my first day doing this workout. Never felt such a good burn and so effective the first time
am in
Glad to say this works perfectly! Already started to see and feel the results within the first day!
My 10th day and I can see some changes woohoo
Here i go
4.1k haters thats couldn't do it
You should make your own workout app
Day one completed, wish me luck ya'll.
This man is terrifying u remind me of my grandpa strict and straight to the point
@athleanx: I am not able to keep balance in alternative thread needle workout. Any suggestions for the same?
So how did this muscle-bound ..... get his name top of a search for Shin Ohtake?!
I did that, I couldnt eat for two days
I've been at this for 3 months now and I can say without a doubt this works damn good. Well for me it did anyway, my buddy has been doing it with me this whole time and I've got a lot more cut then he has. Diet really is key if you are wanting to be able to see your progress.
Awesome.
Dam it is not easy this exercise r harder then push-ups I have big arm muscles but no abs even my chest is big but no abs I am still doing those excerice today it is 8 day but I get some pain in stomach when I finish this exercise for sometime
Best fitness trainer in d world... Love from India...#Athlean X🏃😍✌👍🇮🇳
What should we eat ? Should i keep my regular diet or i need some changes
Very good ads workout
does this not overwork the abs if you do every single day
I had a crop top on while doing the first exercise and we have hardwood floors so I barely made it because I found it tickling that my back sounded like it was passing gas💀💀💀
2:45 Does anyone know the name of his shoes ? They look awesome...
The Papa John's commercial before this video didn't help my motivation levels.
Jeff I'm not sure I can work out my abs for 22 days straight without resting
I whish we could like this vid every time we come back 2 it
When’s the best time to train abs? Before or after weight lifting?
1. I liked it and did a few rounds  2. I don’t think I had correct form but I felt the struggle creeping up on my towards the end of the rounds  3. I did a few rounds and fixed my form for the last couple and then it got quite hard towards the end  4. Thread the needle is abit strenuously so I did 8 a side so i could to more rounds 5. Jack knifes were good I went a few rounds and felt my abs get tighter ever round but form was abit off at start 6. I couldn’t really do these because I couldn’t get my shoulders of the ground properly but I’m sure tomorrow I manage this it’s probably got abit of a technique I haven’t figured out yet   Overall: I liked these exercises and I feel that they will do something for me after 22 days. I also think after a few days I should get the hang of it and learn proper form because I feel one of my mistakes through doing this today was form because some exercises went great and took many rounds while others I couldn’t do very well, but we all learn somehow and I shall complete this 22 day challenge.  (will be back to say how I went in 22 days)
Hi can you make a work out for a person with a missing left arm? Some of these I can’t do. Thanks for your help in advance!
The second work-out is pissing me off I keep falling
Love it!
Somebody school me, I was told by multiple people, working abs everyday is okay, but not beneficial . But I see this video of doing ab workouts for 22 days?
I'll try this
it feels weird when I do some of these especially the stationary bike ( feels weird like im rocking or swinging), jack knives feel weird I can't keep my legs up its like my lower back is pushing the ground and my back is arching alittle.   HEELS To heaven feel good but sometimes I feel a strain on my neck upper shoulders/colour bones I try to keep them stable and down. any help on these, is it just not suitable for my body and I should do other workouts?
4th day and i already can see results... THIS IS AMAZING!
Do you take any days off to rest for the 22 days abs?
Très bien
Just finished day 1. Wish me luck on the next 21 days!
Any recommendations for like fat burners or anything?
Just got done with day 1!
Too much crap in Athlean-X Vids!! guy can never be on point !!
Hey guys; i am trying this out for the next 22 days!! I am typing this as a reassurance to do it and for any support at all.   Day 1: Very difficult, didn’t reach extinction on any. Threading the needle made me fall on myself. Ha ha. Still not as hard as MPC baseball workouts, but who knows.
After 15 days I can see visible changes in my stomach my loose tummy became very solid and tight and lossed fat around my tummy
I starter this yesterday dont worry 3 weeks later i will show my results
I’m gonna do this I’ll keep everyone updated (i’ll try) I hope I can do this :)
4.1k fat people disliked this video

Honestly saying, YOU ARE THE BEST... those who disliked your video, whether they are jealous and ignorant or they don't understand anything about fitness... well done xoxox
Hey guys....I have extreme belly fat and sides.....will this work to reduce that or is it just to bring the abs out? Will this help me out in slimming down?
So I do this everyday for 22 days?
Really nice workout plan. But I am facing a few difficulties. While doing no 2 and 4 my arms hurt a lot to maintain that position and I give up even before my abs reach failure. And for 5 and 6 my neck gets too stiff and starts to hurt. Can someone tell me how to overcome this please
Im gonna try this ! From today !
The key here besides 6 is to literally keep your legs STRAIGHT. More weight from your leg equals more resistance.
I haven't even started yet and I can see the results
Jeff I love ur videos so informative and challenging 👍🏻
Should you drink protein after doing this?
so we can exercose abs daily fr 22 days ???? is it correct like pepl say we should nt work out same muslce daily , please expalin
Just made my first attempt at this. I did quite poorly, but that's definitely better than I ever did before (not at all) 😅  Looking forward to 22 days from now.
Hey Jeff. I have an anterior pelvic tilt. Would you recommend not doing some of these exercises because it looks like they also hit on the hip flexors?
So by winning you are losing
Bakwas hai

For arms what we do

Joggar name bro

I'm interested in this routine but I have a bad lower back and suggestions on how to make all the floor work on my back less painful?
I didn't get any response
The thing is I'm under weight.. So can I do abs workout??
Awesome! I have a few questions: How much time between each set? Back in my P90X days, I was taught not to train abs every day. Thoughts?
Jeff I'm already following other workouts n I'm getting results slowly..That's gr8☺️☺️ But for Abs first time I'm gng to start.. Super excited
How many times each day?
Day 14, I feel amazing
Nice video  For more fitness video click here: #pankajwalfitness
I'm at day 4 now and my core is very sore. should I push through? Because it is so uncomfortable now that I reach extinction extremely fast in every exercise.  Got some advice anyone?
Iam in my 17 days feeling abs and muscles all around my body
do you repeat every cleared exercise?
all i could do was the first exercise 4 reps, man! my body is in the worst shape ever
when im doing the: alternating thread the needle, when im rotating with my right hand, my left shoulder keeps cracking or making noises is it normal? cause when im rotating with my left hand my right hand doesnt make any kind of noise
can woman do this  ab workout ?
👍
If My Abs are burning the next day - should I still continue, or should I wait for them to calm down?
I star tomorrow wish me luck
Started Day 1. I'm doing the whole 22! Ima come back sexy on they ass 😂😂
Hey Jeff I've been doing this workout and after the 6th day I just stopped getting sore I've added your other ab workouts and  just kept going til I couldn't. But I still don't get sore I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing I am still getting results from it.
Hey Jeff I've been doing this workout and after the 6th day I just stopped getting sore I've added your other ab workouts and  just kept going til I couldn't. But I still don't get sore I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing I am still getting results from it.
Should we do the given workouts for the given time only or repeat??
Ur amazing man bought to try ur 22 day abs wosh me luck
Will this help me get a six pack?
When I tried a second exercise I did not feel anything in my abs. Only the pressure on my forearms. Am I doing it wrong?
Hey man love your videos, keep up the good work. I started this routine it’s really good and very tough. Appreciate your effort to make everybody healthier .
Hello Jeff. Was wondering if you could do something for spinal injuries. I got osteomyelitis of t11-t12. No disc now and bones are damaged. I do pushups everyday and crunches. I lost alot of muscle and strength. I was no gym buff but had a very physical job that kept me strong and fit. I like this video and am wondering if it would suit me. Thanks Jeff watching alot of your vids and have done the posture one and found it very helpful.
This is the best abs workout 8 days and already getting in shape (updates)
I'm a woman so for any other girls interested I'm planning on doing this workout so I'll try to keep up with it and post if I see any results. Just finished the first day and I was dying after the 3rd exercise but won't give up. Hopefully I'm not doing any of these wrong. Wish me luck :)
Man I like this sets/reps idea: on for 45 seconds and that earns you a 10-second rest; build up your number of sets over time!
Ok, i'll start Tomorrow after hitting the gym, i'll be back in 23 days
8.7 million views... Wow
He makes it look so easy
Found this video about a week ago. I'm excited to see how I feel towards the end of these 22 days. Right know, all I feel is a constant burn in my abs when I approach this and I can't even hold my legs up for the last exercise.
Thanks
Dont know what the hell it is Im doing wrong but for some reason I cant keep my elbow down when doing the step through... how can i fix that?
I’m going to start today but I’m only 14 do u think I will make it (I do workout everyday)?
just completed first day generally found the majority of them easy but a few did catch me out and struggled on them significantly
Damn Bravo Bro. You are shredded and buffed perfection. Congrats. I'm back into working out. You have great suggestions. Thx
Is there a follow along video of this? Would like t do this but I wanted to follow along as you do it
Day 1: Could do them all except for the needles- did 5 on each instead of 10. Belly: fatty with no visible abs.
If too much flab covers your abs . Start jumping rope 15 minutes everyday your fat percentage will lower down. Though it will take a lot of time. It will be precisely done the day you are able to skip 30 minutes non stop. Check the world record if you think 30m is hard
First day comes tomorrow can’t wait
Please try to set the camera on different sides while filming an exercice so we're sure to make the exacte same mouvements you do with no mistakes .
all of us have rest days 1 or 2 days in the week should we train the abs those days too?
Is it really a good idea to do this everyday? The day after and the day after that I'm aching. I think I'll do it every 4 days
I’m starting this today, I will keep you guys updated
Hey everyone I’m starting right now and I will give you updates
I'm going to start this because I need this
Sir. Does gym cause for hair loss ???
So to be clear, these 6 exercises every day? Or 1 different exercise each day?
My excuse is I'm fat and can't do one of these
Day 1 starts now :)
Isnt normal that after ive been doing this for a week my stomach extremely hurts
I hope this get easier and more full fulling as the days go on, I could barely do the whole workout what I did do was about +/-15mins In total I felt like I accomplished very little. Sigh I guess my core is extremely weak lol
Great Video!
How many times a day should you do those routine?
Gonna give it a try and make a documentary day by day
The heels to the heaven is stressing my lower back is it okay?
Finished this, here's the breakdown:   I did this for 22 days in a row, I supplemented my normal workout (back/chest/leg/ab days). I did not modify my diet (chicken/salmon with rice and healthy food about 60% of meals, salads 20% of meals, 20% less healthy food. During this time I went to the gym 7 days a week, not skipping a day. 1st exercise: I liked this one, but I struggled to keep my legs completely straight. 2nd exercise: I either didn't do the step through plank correctly, or it was too easy. (I found myself not getting an ab workout but a plank work out and my arms would get tired.)  3rd exercise: X-men crunches are my favorite 4th exercise: I modified this to do 5 on each side before alternating. I felt more of the mind-muscle connection, and it extended how long I could do it before my arms gave up. 5th: Jack knives were the hardest, and I could never get 1 full cycle. Good workout but my lower back would start to hurt really quickly. 6th: Liked this one, felt a bit of a burn.  Overall, I saw a little bit of change, especially when I did this workout after an ab day. After I finished 22 days, I went back to 6 days a week of working out and have been doing this every workout since. I definitely feel improvement and my abs are stronger, but the visual results are slightly disappointing.   *on a side note: my other compound exercises, squats, bench press, deadlifts, etc. have all improved significantly, so overall I'm pleased with the results of training abs while still getting stronger.
He looks like Lionel Messi
On point, similar things I've found over the years, you know your shit.
I'm not a biggener, I've been working out regularly for 7 months now. My abs are slightly showing under normal light. However, I'm going to have a summer holiday after twe weeks and I missed up my diet the last two weeks. My abs now are less visible. Thus I'm going to try this workouts everyday for the coming two weeks with speed intervals cardio after every session and update you with the results. I'm on my third day now and my abs havent been sore like this for long time
I am 14 age I had six abs
But we cant train one body part continously ...man....how is it possible to train one body part continously
This is my day 4 and im sore
Starting today, doing updates every week. Reply to this so I remember to actually update
So u do the same thing for 22 days? Tried Jeff's app but after week 1 u need to buy the premium version to Got to the next week  Please help
I cant do jack knives. Can anyone help??
I already did the 22 day my new body is awsome
i cant see your abs because of the subtitles showing on your belly
Is twisting da legs side to side like the stationed bicycle a benefit also??
there needs to more 22 day workout vids
Learned alot from u #sohailqureshigym
Damn! Just made my Day 1 round and its intense. Crazy cool to feel how challenging it is though.
I'll try this next year..
Nice! So you have also to repeat the repetition based exercises till you can't any more?  So I do 12 reps X-men Crunch and then start again till I can not do again 12? Thanks.
I am 17 should I do this exercise?
This is the best workout i found . I did abs workout before but this one sores me so fast. At day 3 i can see my abs in some positions whitout flexing myself. Today is my day 4 and i am soo exosted
I am starting this challenge today! I will keep everyone updated until the 22nd day and then i will carry on if i see good results  I have been working out my abs for a month or 2 now, so my abs are sort of visible but i wanna try this 22 day challenge along with my other workouts
Does this workout reduce the body fat too? I mean to say is it a multipurpose set of exercises?
Day 1 : 8/1/18
Im just 13 yrs old very hard for A kid i only do crucnches
I've working out for than 3 years and I couldn't find any abworkout that was good but this plan I tried today and started to feel the burn in my ab I will tryout for 22 day and will update later on about the results
I haven’t had sore abs in a long time
My 21st bday is August 22 today is July 31, we are on!!
Day number 2 done and my abs are on my fire
I love seeing the people who’re like, “Ima start today, wish me luck! I’ll keep you guys updated!” And some don’t even comment on day 1 while others stop at day 3 or 4 lol
I appreciate your workout techniques...but can you suggest what to eat as I want to gain muscles and lose love handles at the same time...or you can share a link of any video. Yours sincerely, Middle aged wannabe athelte
Anybody know what underarm training technique is ? Still do know also if I keep going till I can't last 45 seconds I'll be here forever I will modify into sets of one hundred thank you anyway the exercises are very helpful
How to reduce the chest width. Could you tell me guy???  plzzzz
No need to rest in these 22 days?
I tried this routine this morning and sh*t hurts so much. I thought I died lol
1:36 peep my dude in the back, he has lost 100% body fat 💪💀
Day one today, it was not easy since I have a belly :))) . 21 to go, will update
I m going to start Abs workout today. Stay tuned for updates. Day 1
I really want to start doing this and I will incorporate this in my workout from today. All I wanted to ask was, should I work my abs after going on a run or before going on a run?  Similarly, if it’s chest day or something, should I work my abs before working my chest or after?
This is the money maker right here!
He makes excersices look so easy
I love how there's literally hundreds of people commenting: "I'm starting, will write back in 22 days to tell you how it went", and most about everyone never ever replied :D
Tooooo hard for beginners...
Nice
Im too thin how  can I build muscle?
I have a doubt if I start abs workouts should I loss chest muscles and arms muscle
Plisss sub indonesiaa
Damn this is rough I love it
Exactly what I needed: adaptable, no equipment (I travel for a living, so very important for consistency). Thanks!
You love flexing at the end don't u lol
👌👌👍💪💪
He didnt tell me i was gonna be the video look in the background 😔
I am only seeing just 2 packs abs. Even with regular workout, I can't see a sign of any muscle other than these two appearing. What should I do?
Jeff, ur awesome.
after 2 months doing it, i can tell i still keep on struggling on thread the needle, it is the most hardest and tiring, i can only doing it one reps and 4 more steps
Very nyc brother
Bruuuh... am i the last one that can’t get the shoulder blades off of the floor on the last exercice ???? It’s my day 1 though aha ! First couple of exercices were fine but the last one 😂
This kicked my abs on day one! Thanks Jeff
Sub to me i do the same
Let’s see if I bitch out. Day one: threading the needle had me grunting from the first one, and screaming 30 seconds in.  The X cross move felt really good, but wasn’t as bad as I expected. By the time I reached the jackknife I wasn’t able to get my back off the floor. Had to settle for some muscle holds in a curved V position to kill the rest of me. My back feels excellent from the thread the needles though. Will try to update daily. This will be my workout journal? Do note I’m starting from literal scratch, due to injuries my core is nearly atrophied, though I’m certain many more muscles than your average person are in it. Did his bicep ultimate tip on top of it with 15 lbs. Gonna feel that one tomorrow.
What if the exercise is too easy?  Should I increase the time? Are more reps more effective than a longer time doing the exercise?
dude you are amazing
Best video I seen so far, Ima actually do it
Why don't you make a playlist with an actual workout people can follow along with?
This is not for beginners/fat people hahaha it sucked kinda made me feel like shit because I couldn’t get through it but hey day 1 done 21 more to go. But hoping to get through the 22 days without stoping
For some odd reason no matter how good I stretch I cramp extremely bad in my abdominal area when doing ab workouts. Would you happen to know why this happens?
Pls make for biceps
I cant wait to do this tonight!! Wish me luck guys
What shoes is he wearing?? Haha seen best in the step through planks
Grandson of Jack Lalanne??
Wow that felt f**king amazing
I started from yesterday, but i've got lower back pain...i think i was wrong or my body is not suitable for this exercise..
my abs hurt from watching this video so I think I'll watch it for 22 days straight kthx
Day 5 finished
I'll start today, stay tunned form more updates!
Can someone please explain to me why can’t I do the last excercise whenever I try my scapula hits the floor
I started this workout yesterday and decided to update my progress as a way of holding myself accountable! I am 6'0 and fairly thin with no real definition in my abs. I just finished playing college sports and have let myself go over the summer and want to get back to it. Day 1 went well! The alternating jacknives were way harder than he made them look in the video but I am gonna keep grinding. 7/25/18
Ur the best  trainer I have completed my 5 days of training
I completed the challenge! I weigh 260 and with some gym time I’ve not only lost weight but I’ve also found that I can last the ab challenge and repeat. Obviously I didn’t grow abs because I’m bigger, but I can feel the change my body has undergone, like muscle growth in my arms what not. I’m going to try to do this challenge every month. It’s super easy and a good at home workout when i can’t make it to the gym!!
Can you do this for as long as you want? Or should I take a few rest days after the 22 days?
Doing heels to the heaven and having a pain in lower back, is something possibly wrong with my form?
Aight nigga ima get shredded
Day 4 finished
I was able to do the first two exercises, but as soon as i got to the X-men I cant even get my shoulders off the ground. I'm not sure how high i should be lifting my shoulders for it to be considered a rep
Ok so day one was yesterday and my abs are sore asf even my legs and butt are sore I’m just going to make a thread for the every day update bout to do day two
I completed day 7 today..first 4 days my abs hurt like fucking hell but after that i didnt feel that much of pain but my abs did hurt a bit after workout.When i pinch my stomach i see a 4 pack.I also see a bit of muscle when my stomach is normal...15 days left and I hope i will have 6 pack !
*"The first one seems like a torture! Lol...But these workouts are great help I think! Thank you so much Jeff! I love you*
Well i will try this. 22 days, will hopefully lose some Belly fat before , Thanks.
I have 6 abs before this but it weak as hell, can not do it right form as you do
Day 1: Didn't even reach a single extinction goal
Hey guys, I have a question. On my day 2 of the workout as I did exercise no 1. my spine was hurting with the floor. I now have a bruise on that spot. I was working out on a rug, and even put a towel on it to make it a bit softer, but it did not help much. Did someone have similar problems ? I'm not sure if I something is wrong. My spine comes out over those long muscles on my back when I bend. Is the solution to work on my back muscles to get them bigger ?
It’s go time.
It’s day 4 and I can see mine
So you train the abs everyday? No rest days? Is the correct ?
What if I can’t get my chest up enough to do the jackknifes? Or the Xmens?
How much rest after each exercise?
Am gonna try this start from today
My day 1 starts tomorrow...Thankyou so much
When i do these exercises i have a pain in my lower back. Can someone please tell me what im doing wrong or what i can do to avoid lower back pain
I cant even do the jack knifes. I'll get there. Been slacking on my core
Should I maintain my normal gym routine as well including already existing ab workout
So for this program do i have to stop training my other parts for 22 days?
Is there a replacement I can do for the 2nd workout I got a bum knee
Will this help lower body fat too cause I'd like my abs to be visible.
it is very tough, I couldn't complete one routine. I have belly fat so is this the reason?
it's 6 steps. I have a question when I finish first step how long do I  rest before second step ? do not rest then go to second step?
You really should make coaching app like freeletics man, I'll gladly subscribe to it
Alright I'll start today! Wish me luck lol
Exactly one year ago i started working out with this video. Since then i improved every day and right now, i am training at a whole nother level. Thank you Jeff, you sparked the flame.
I wanna get ride by you 🐇
Starts tomorrow.. Wish me luck 😀 Edit: damn I've got em😍I've got chest too😍
what should we wear? I mean to avoid the risk of a hernia.
So after 22 days with this workout I’ll get abs?
I don't get it I don't feel the workouts iny my abs and i can barely even hold my balance enough to do them. I just get to a point where I can't do it anymore but my abs barely feel it at all :( Does anyone have any advice?
woow man you are awesome!😀
How did actually try the workout
His back is like perfect
Hey Bro. Where did you buy puma track pants ??

This works.
*watches this while eating ice cream*

Best biceps he had
Jeff has some awful abs xd
Wow.
Tjats such a good workout, its been a long time since ive been this tired
Couldn't even do a crunch after the xman crunches heck my life
I really want to try this but I have an impinged shoulder. Is this safe for my shoulders or should I wait untill it's healed up.
He is really a great  👨 👌👌👌
Gotta change your mindset to finish your workout by failing to finish the exercise. Scientifically it makes sense but it's just different, you don't have the felling that you completed something, you just work until you can't move
I've started this workout, but I dunno, I think I'm doing some of them wrong because I don't really feel the pressure on the given point, instead I just run out of breath, but I won't give up. Any tips?
Love your vids but two of these excersizes do nothing
Great tips!! They all actually work well!! Thanks.  Now tip for you..please stop lacing your sneaks so tight. Trust me they won’t run away.
I cant do the jack knifes that well any tips plz???
Theres some exercises I've never done in this. Will give it a try. Thanks.
I cracked my whole back on the thread the needle exercise... shut us harder than I expected. GREAT workout as always!
How much rest between each exercise? 10 sec as weil?
I thought you needed off days/rest to improve O.o
I want to loose my side thigh and butt. can you help me?
Would it be okay if i was doing this + his “7 minute ab workout 6 pack promise” everyday as well?
so hypertrophy isn't a thing here? or?
Guys plz let me know ur experiences below ,i will be doing this from tom onwards .
y abs are aligned but the top left ab is bigger than my top right ab due to the posture I have been doing my whole life. looks like this:   oO OO OO  so how do I do workout isolation on my top right ab?
👍
how much restime between each excercise?
Oh my goodness Jeff I just did your plank knee tuck ins and the figure 8 plank with socks on my tiled floor...it killed me! Thanks!  I feel like my body is going through withdrawals ..like I seriously feel sick for whatever reason... Maybe I've been working my body a bit too hard the last couple days! I just feel so guilty when I've taken 3 or more days down when I'm not feeling good or if I binge on candy.... Oh and why isn't there an athlean XX women app?
Beat i really felt the burn damn
Can i do it twice a day for 22 days and will it be more effective i have the v line i have the line down the middle i just have baby fat and my abs do not show what so ever
Day 1- Gets abs
Already two days in and I’m dead.😵
What is the best time during the day to do this?
Starts at 1:50
Wait if you do the first excsrcise to the end you have 10 second rest and then you do it again till you cant do.it anymore...how is that good if you cant do the excercises to the end then,because if you do.7 times the first excercise to the end and 8th time you cant,how can you be able to continue to another 5 excercises???
This routine one time a day or more ???
All the given exercises we have to do again and again until we cannot???
Nice
So just finished my first session, felt a bit disappointed cause I gave up easily on a few but my abs couldn’t go further. Anyways I’ll keep everyone updated. I started off pretty much with just being able to do two rounds of each and only pushed myself on the last one for a third round. Anyways stay tune and hopefully I get the habit going cause I want to continue pass the 22 days
Intense
Whey what do I do if i can't do 1 bike ? :):
this is a fun workout 😃 I love it.
My body is all shaky when I do these . Why? Like I feel like I'm not doing it right because I'm shaking
My Name Is Jeff
What will be more better,should i exercise for reducing belly fat first or directly start this routine.
Please Give exercise to loose chest fat.
Is this exercise good for belly fat loss?? Mr Athlean?? Please someone tell me!!!
Im on my 13th day and yes im seeing results fast just dont give up it takes time to see results thanks jeff these is really helping me
Been doing the workout. Wondering why back has a feeling of crapping maybe slight pain while doing heels to the heavens?
Did an intense workout today, I'm going to start this tomorrow and I'll let you know how it goes. Can someone remind me?
UPDATE:
starting day 1 is today. Will notify of how i feel
Anyone wanna start, from today doing this daily for 22 days ? I’ll update y’all but anyone else in with me ?
Alternating thread the needle hurts my shoulder a bit. Any way to fix this?
I’m sick of feeling like shit I’m going to give an update starting today and see how it goes by giving a daily change to the comment from day 1 to 22 Day 1: Ouch! Note to self, use gym shoes Day 2: I’m feeling a burning sensation now. FYI I’m skinny and weigh 104 pounds. No fat on me I assume. Guess beginners luck?
I'm only 12 still putting in effort for my fitness and health
I'm 1.68m tall and i weigh 57.5 is that ok? I am 16 years old and a boy
I like this very much
i'm still confused...some experts say abs are just like any other muscle and need rest then again I hear abs can be trained every day...so what is it now?
I think I finally found the right one for me here!👍
This guy is the best. Very hardworking and helpful.
Bakchodi kam kra kro
I will start tomorrow iA. 07.07.2018
Going to start giving updates with some detail on the reps. Day 1 starts tomorrow.
So I’ve been doing this for 2 days now and my stomach hurts does that mean it’s working.?? Btw I do see a difference already! I’ll update u guys damn I forgot ab this but aye this really worked definitely recommend but then I got lazy and started gaining fat:( but ima do this again for sure
Going to my beach house in Italy at the start of August and im 92kg, heaviest I've ever been. Muscly but over 20% body fat for sure at the moment. Going to throw this workout in for the next 22 days on top of my usual gym and cardio routine. Let's see how it goes!
Challenge accepted m8
Day 8 done.. loving this workout.. question, the last 2 exercises do you do them just once each or again like the others till you fail.. Thanks
I don't think I'm doing the stationary bikes right because I don't feel it really at all compared to the others. I go back and forth for 30 seconds and feel nothing.
thank you, it is verry helpful to me
I am going on a cruise in 38 days I’ll do this and incorporate some other work out let see if I’ll be comfortable taking my shirt by then.
Next video for chest workout
Can i do these exercises to flat my tummy or these are exclusive to build the abs?
Umm the 21 day habit thing is a total myth it takes approximately 2 to 8 months to develop a new habit not 21 oh btw its 21 not 22
I'm just a bit confused. After the stationary bike, the last part, is that it? or another set?
So I work 7am to 4pm Sat to Wed with Thurs/Fri off, I try to sleep from 10:30pm to 6am. I’m willing to adjust my sleep schedule for a recommend time of day I should work out. Basically what I’m asking is for anyone’s advice on what’s a good recommended time I should work out for best results? Or, does it not matter and should I just pick an hour each day that’s convenient?
So basically use all of my energy on the first workout
Wait so once I can’t go further with the exercise, do I rest before I go into the next workout? Or do I start immediately after not being able to go further?
ima come back in 22 days and tell ya if it helped me
I was told that your muscles need to rest and that you shouldn't workout every single day unless you are doing something different on every day like bizeps, next day trizeps, then leg day and so on.
I don’t think I’ve ever felt a better burn in my abs than this
Day 1 done..tbh its fucking hard, especially the X-men one...  will give you update soon.. just keep replying on my comment in case my comment is nowhere to be found..
Im starting this today im 18 years old and skinny(flat belly) ill keep you guys updated every other day
Who would give this a thumbs down?
Oh shit! I’m down! 07/02/2018 ....
👍
How long in between different exercises? 10 sec?
tried to do this and its really hard to stay up with the exercises. I found myself constantly adjusting my tabata. A follow-along vid would be helpful so that I dont have to toggle back and forth from the video to my timer.
Am I the only one who thinks he sounds and looks like Ross from FRIENDS?
You are so AMAZING!!! I always follow you while I am a long distance runner. You help and "Inspire" me so much!
Excessive flatulence and headache in the few first days  ! is it normal ?
Are you above 30
Starting this! Just completed Day 1. I wonder how many calories it does it burn though. I wanna know because I keep track of my workout and the calories burned via X Record app.
You could add a cardio for max results!!!!!
Ok the jackknives killed me...challenge accepted
studies show it takes about 66 days to develop a habit
You do this everyday?
22 consecutive days or alternate?? Also We do a warmup and cool down separately for this workout right?
Starting today July 1st and ending up July 22 I promise to keep you guys updated I’m not funna be like those people that just leave you guys all hoped up . I got y’all .
Thanks Jeff sounds like a great plan!
how much is 12 reps
I just did day one and by the time i got past the x man crunches i was failing. I didnt realize how weak my core was....
Thanks! I will do it #day1
My trainer says training any muscle continuously is not good any muscle group needs recovery and rest . Can someone explain me if this is good idea to have this challenge.
I keep going till I physically can’t do it anymore and I’m already seeing results. I’m not sure whether to thank you or hate you Jeff 😂
Day 9:  Heels to the heaven: 3 sets Step through planks: 2-3 sets X man crunch: 3 sets Alternating thread the needle: 1 set Alternating jackknifes: 3 sets  Stationary bike: 3 sets  Then finish it up by doing as much sit-ups I can do in 4 minutes. No rest between exercises!
I have left 30 from now to reopen of my university,hope I will get abs before that😍
So i do all what he said every day
I get tense in my legs n nerves then I get mad .... Why though it's like agervated nerve feeling on my legs
How much rest between exercises?
This makes no sense. It's not supposed to reach your limit every time you workout, that's not the way a good workout is planned
This is awesome I love it.
Hey, guys can i train for example my chest in this 22 days?  What do you think?
How much time between the different exercises?

Nice vid. I'm gonna come back after a month to comment if the workout worked.
Lucky for me i already have abs just hoping this will get them more defined
3rd day feeling the pain gains
So every day the same amount of seconds and reps
Day 2......Thanks Jeff!!!!
I try it,  and its not easy, good vid bro,  thanks.
Should I do ab workouts everyday?
“Nothing worth having will come easy” that’s a great quote brother
my abs started hurting just by watching this video
The alternating jack Knife - Do you legs stay up?or you bring them to the ground?My balance is so off...i cant even come up when my feet are both up!!
Should I do more reps with lighter weights OR lesser reps with heavier weight to lose fat and build strength?
i just did my first day and after 2 sets heels to the heavens and 2 sets of step through planks  i could not do the x-men crunch no matter how hard i tried ,still did 2 sets of alternating threading the needle i tried but could not do the alternate jacknifes corectly so i jumped to the last exercice and did 3 sets of stationary bike...i feel so out of shape after 1 year of no constant workouts
And let’s not forget, DIET DIET and DIET!
Day 1........
I'm in FOR the Abs
I did this for 22 days i dont know why it didnt worked.. daily at 5 am i used to watch this video straight for 22 days... disappointed
Thanks for sharing this video. Found it very helpful.
22 days ha! I am on!
I’m down for this
How much should you rest between Each exercise?
Trying this from tomorrow . Hope so this works will be updating . Will do IF with one meal a day plus 30 min walk . Lets get out of depression and anxiety . Anyone want to join ?
SERIOUS QUESTION: For those (relatively few) who down-voted this video: why down-vote? Where is he wrong?
I just did the first ab workout which is on the top of the list: "Heels to the heavens". I can honestly say I did it the way you taught it on this channel, and I was feeling it in my abs. So much so, when I went for another 45 seconds heels to the heavens, I couldn't do another one. At the same time, I do appreciate this. And I WILL COMMIT to the 22 days of ab training. Thanks again Jeff!
Your biceps distract me
Is this workout okay for teens?
I’ve done this workout for 22 days and its amazing.  I recommend it to everyone but it’s not easy.   Ps: I’m a female bodybuilder i workout 5 to 6 days a week.   Thank You for the amazing videos and advices ♥️
I can’t do the jack knive or the bicycle
You’re amazing bro
Bro, sport a beard, it will help you attract a lot people.
Just for anyone like me who just found this, I’m starting tomorrow, and will update every five days. Along with this I’m eating clean, and doing fasted cardio like jogging, biking, and trampolining every day!
Day 1: a total success, thought I wasn’t gonna finish it. I’ll update you guys till day 22!
I dont like hardly any videos, but i think this is gonna be magical. thanks bro.... BeefCake!!!
Do i still do normal Workout for other muscles ?
4:07 Jeff:don't lose your balance 4:08 Me: *falls all the way over to the other side* 😂😂
Bro abs were shredded after this
Day 1 and FYI I’m a guy
Oml I didn't even realize that I finished my 22nd day today of the workout wow it's been an experience and btw I am 14 and was abt 98 pounds and now after the 22 days I came from having a chubby belly to actual pretty good abs. I am 106 pounds now btw and my abs aren't rock hard obviously but they r definitely there and visible so honestly overall this is approved u do get abs in 22 days and it does definitely work. I'ma keep going
Hey Jeff, would you mind telling us how to reduce the visceral and subcutaneous fat??
Hi, Jeff! What if my back is a little weak for these things? What can I do to strengthen them. I really wanna be able to do these type of things. Anyone? Thanks!
Does gender matter?
Fantastic!!! Thank you!!!
What about diet plan guys
Do you guys do this everyday or a certain amount cause I thought you couldn’t work abs more than 3 days a week
Thanks bro
I found these workouts to be very hard for beginners, some of them require the ability to hold up your entire body. I also found that I was using the strength in my neck instead of my stomach to work the movement. I’d love to see other positions that don’t strain so much on the rest your body but focus on the stomach with maximum results
the floor is hard as fuck (wooden floors) my spine, elbows, tailbones interferes ,iss really uncomfortable should i get some mat or something?  Edit: i got a mat
Is there any diet to follow?
Can anyone tell me that how many set of one exercise
Am I doing something wrong I been doing this for 4 days and my ab area is killing me 💀
Day one just finished pretty sweaty, i didn't get extinction on 3,4, and 5.
I’m Starting this today! I’ll be updating as often as I can! I’ll also follow a 2500 caloric diet. Wish me luck!
Big fan of you from Pakistan
How many set for each  exercises, so total how many set ? And  how much rest for after to finish set ?
just did it, it feels good really tight in my core thanx bro. good stuff.
Hai dude, I, m lean so will it be helpful to me to grow muscles or will be difficult to my health?
I am having weight of 75 kgs if I do these exercise for 22 days no rest , shall i be able to gain abs?
This sounds great! But I’d also like to workout my other body parts. When do I incorporate this?
I hope I dont injure myself.  But every work I am surprised I didnt die.  Thanks so much for the great ab work out - I think ? Wish me luck
I'm 13 giving this a try is heck of a workout
Can we take rest between two exercises
I dont have a flat stomach. little bellied. will this workout help me to get a flat tomach?
Day 1: Have no visible abs, couldn't do a single rep of thread the needle.  21 days to go
Last time I couldn't do it lost some weight and have been training this is way tuffer than the other ab workouts you've posted this is a real but kicker
I've been fasting losing weight now it's time to get those abs stredded no more pudding gut
We have to do only one set of this ryt?

Can we do this workout on a couch or it will be bad?
Am from India. .tamil nadu. ..i was soo lean may try this can i get abs. .plz reply me. ..plz understand my situation. .😦😦😦😧
Is it bad if my back keeps cracking when I do heels to heaven
σk í'll trч ít tσσ 😄
Most of the comments are by Indians 😂😂
No joke i got an 8 pack ripped bcuz of this workout in 6 weeks this works.people all u have to do is follow a proper caloric deficiet diet.
Recommended been doing for 6 days I'm 14 I could feel my abs before now I'm starting to see them 100% try it
I’m going to do this everyday and see if I get results in 22 days
I know this a 22 days program... But ideally should you work your abs everyday? Im just starting  working out
I'm so glad I found this channel..Thanks for all the awesome tips Jeff. These are by far the best suggestions for ab exercises. They may look simple but definitely very challenging when done correctly. Keep up the good work Jeff.
Day 1 commences right here people!  Started today & as I don't know the moves yet, i was watching Jeff do them while I copied, so wasn't going for 45 seconds, i just changed when he did and had a 10 second break between some of them.  I'll keep yall updated for day two and I'll try memorize these moves.
Should you do some cardio with this like before like I’d probably do a mile
This is my second day of your workout. Its hard as hell. I'm not a slob by any means but I have a belly and I want it gone. I want to thank you for your videos, I'm learning alot.
Thanks for this, I'm going to give it a try, since my other options rn are dwelling in self-pity, suicide and/or murder.
Wow day 12 and abs already visible, V-Cut is also visible. 😮 But my lower back is paining soooooo much now can't do anymore, but have to😂😭. Thanks jeff.
I already have 2 abs .. just 2 the 2 that are in the top . So would it be faster to get the other 4 or 6 packs if i did this trainings everyday ...?? (Some one respond )
Thanks! I'm trying to get my abs by July! I've started doing Freeletics in january but although I see results, it's not fast enough... still waiting for my sixpack! Your video hopefully will help me reach that goal!
Any recommended video for best gym diet i don’t have belly fat but only small ....ing layer that cover the abs and can’t get rid of it and i don’t want to diet hard so I don’t lose muscle size any help is appreciated
Has anyone finished this? From the comments below its all about starting.  Can some give me an update if it works- I have the lower obliques but not well defined + top 4 abs
good but i didnt burn any fat :/ and my abs will not show
Day 1 Relatively fast workout. Heels to the Heavens, managed 2 x 45 seconds + barely 5 seconds. Step Trough Planks: 40 seconds really struggling. X Man: 0 reps. Needle: 2 reps. Jackknifes: 0 reps. Bikes: unable to lift shoulders from the floor.  Day 2 Nope, cant do even single sit up  Day 3 Nope, cant do even single sit up  Day 4 Cut Heels to 1x 20 seconds and moved on Cut Planks to 1x 20 and moved on X Man 2 Needle 4 Jackknifes 2 with a fuck ton of momentum to get shoulders off the ground Bikes nope.  Now at day 5 and I had to slide out sideways off bed in the morning...
IT'S AWESOME BUT I M JUST 16 YEARS OLD CAN I DO ALL GYM WORKOUTS
💪💪👍👍
Tip* you don’t need to do “ab” workouts to get abs, if you have a low body fat percentage you can get abs which can be accomplished by cardio... your welcome
Why on earth are there so many thumbs down??.  I really liked this video and the extinction aspect of it because that way  whoever is doing it can reach his or her own edge.
so when exactly do i do this routine everyday? i go to the gym in the morning, should i do this ab Routine before or after the gym?
It’s all just fake..... have been working out the same exact exercise for nearly 75 days, and it’s not showing any result.
Heels to the heavean 45sec ext. Step through planks 45sec ext X man crunch 12 reps (or starfish crunch) Alternating thread the needle 10each SIDE. Jack knife 45sec Stationary bike 30 sec
Extinction!!!!! XXXXXXXXXXXX
I love how supportive the comments are of people trying to improve their ab strength, it's ice to see everyone working together and motivating eachother
I ACTUALLY REALLY WANT TO KNOW GUYS IF YOU HAVE DONE THIS PLS HELP. DOES THIS HELP WITH LOSING BELLY FAT OR JUST GAINING ABS
I'm gonna try this
I really like all your vids and instructions, straight to the point. Thanks man
Im 14 yo  171 CM 66 KG   Should i do this or wait till i 16 ???
Thanks to this channel I never looked better
What is the form for step through planks? I'm always feeling pain in my lower area when I try to do them
thats great
Geez, that jackknife, it's like i have a brickwall above me. Can barely raise up a tiny bit.
Jeff = 1,  abs = a world a pain
How many rounds and sets do u have to do
Going to give this a try, starting from today. Will take a Before and after picture. I promise to provide daily updates. My bodyfat is current 14% almost 15%. I’m on a strict diet and tracking it in Myfitnesspal. Feel free to join me and post your daily updates with me!
Met my hero today "Jeff Cavalier"

I could only do until extinction for the first one. I couldn’t go on I was just so weak. Wtf how do you do this
Question, does anybody’s Ribs bones hurt a lot while doing this exercise? I’m on my second day and I can feel the burn
How tf am i supposed to keep my legs together like that... i got my balls between my leg  ...am i supposed to take steriods to make my ball smaller first?

A+ workout man! You really got me going like it's in person, thank you!

Cheers for this, been searching for "tips on getting abs" for a while now, and I think this has helped. Ever heard of - Wiyila Tenadison Principle - (search on google ) ? Ive heard some super things about it and my colleague got excellent success with it.
What is the best protein to increase body mass??
Can you give video about ab muscle

AWESOME .THANKS FOR THIS VIDEO^^..
Alright, so I've been doing bicycle crunches every day for about three weeks and haven't seen much improvement so I'm going to switch to this and see how it goes.
I think I'm doing the last one wrong because my neck hurts, I have my hands on my head but I can't seem to get my shoulders off the ground like he said
43 yrs, I do a lot of cross fit type training. His videos have taught me a lot about technique. Nothing better. I started this ab workout, now finished day 5. My question for Jeff is, I am completing the workout with on average 3 sets of each exercise. It is taking about 20 minutes. I can see a lot of gains. What can I do to shorten the workout and speed up failure.
I been doing these for 3-4 months. I have dedicated to myself but not a lot for diet. But I can totally say I have changed and my abs started to show I’m so happy for this thanks. Going of way more. #EquipmentVibes
I am lying on my bed while watching this🤔🤔🤔
Can I drink water
What eat after abs workout
Rep itt
How much rest between each move?
Tried for the first time but was stopped by a pain in my lower back. Really wish I can defeat it with time and finish all the time/repetitions.
So would there be any downfalls if you started the 22 day workout, then stopped for a couple of days and then start again?
It's working bro. Thanks.  I'm from INDIA
extinction time.. rep limit... basically you just do each exercise until you cant lol
I feel 45secs is not enough. Or im just to slow?
Your body is so great but you are so ugly
hold my beer
22days without any rest that means abs workout daily ?
so what do you do after 22 days?
so what do you do after 22 days?
Ohh got to try this, gonna take some work, but hey in 6 weeks dropped 34lbs. Love the ab roller,  but need more. this is gonna be a killer. Start tomorrow :-)
All 2 set?
Is it better to train abs every day consecutively or have a rest day in between (so about 3 days a week)?
Day 1, I’m almost positive I botched every exercise, nevertheless I still broke a sweat. I am hoping to keep updating but all the failed attempts aren’t really motivators. Lol see ya tomorrow
May I ask a dumb question?   Assuming you get through the 22 days, what next?   Do you take a few days off and start another 22 day cycle?   Do you move on to something even more intense?   Maybe I'm missing something.  Thanks in advance for your help.
I wonder why you always wear trackies. Hmm, skipped leg day?
Can we do this while also doing weight training in the gym
Work out starts at 3:20
is your lower back suppose to arch upward on the x man?
I will actually keep y’all updated every day for 30 days if I forget A Day Of commenting I’ll tell y’all  how it was
Boom! Tetris for Jeff
I will start it now and keep u updated guys!!
How long between different exercises should I wait?
But Jeff thread the needle work for shoulder...?
But Jeff thread the needle work for shoulder...?
May 27th, 2018 start date. Will give updates every 3 days!!
Jeff thank you
GR8  WORK!
I’ve been rocking jeffs ab app recently, I’ll try commit to this for 22 days! I reckon I can, hopefully in 22 days from now I’ll update you, this is also in conjuction with 6 days a week 8-12 gym sessions a week and a healthy low carb diet too though!   All the crunches, bicycles and jackknifed in the world won’t find your six pack if you don’t do the rest! :) like Jeff says, it takes 22 days to form a habit
Say I've done three rounds of 45 secs of Heels to the Heaven, with 10 seconds in between each set, how long do I wait to do step through plank, after failling to complete the fourth set of Heels to the heavens? 30 seconds? 10 seconds? 45 seconds?
Hey jeff when doing the stationary bikes. Can you put your leg on a wall so that it wont move? Or just in the air?
Do it work for fatty person. Like 75kg
Starting today I will keep updated join in also it would help
So, I have to do one of these workouts for 22 Days straight?
lol
I'm 5 days into this. My abs are not so sore anymore but it's still fucking hard. Also for me it's easier to do this in the gym and today I did it in my house and it was awful.
For the first workout. The heels to the heavens. How important is to keep the feet together or is that not a factor. I'm having trouble keeping them together. They separate for me.
Someone has been skipping nipple day
On day 2. Was wondering if you are in pain days later should you take a day rest. I assume some soreness is fine but if i end up in pain is it worth pushing through 22 days straight?
Starting this challenge....
I'M watching this while eating a whole pizza... should I stop?
I am trying this tomorrow morning after my sprints or the rope ripper :)
If I’m 41 and have a bad shoulder I injured 4 + years ago, and intermediate workout history, is your complete program good for me? I’m looking for something that will train me to avoid injury as I age. I am used to training hard and my shoulder can’t take that anymore and my knees aren’t what they used to be either. Please respond.       And does your complete program teach nutrition and diet??
just did this workout and I don't feel nothing. this is bullshit
Sir plz sir tell me some work out for get rid of man boobs plz sir
Day 2: Got through 2 3/4 sets of heels to heaven and halfway through a set of step through planks before my stomach felt like it twisted into a very painful knot. Typing this face down on my living room floor. Send help
1:50
Humbled me real quick. Couldn’t get more than 6-7 reps per exercise throughout the circuit.   Probably because I was gassed out after an intense back session, but nevertheless this circuit is extremely tough, especially if you are heavier like me. Newbies rather not try this.
Day 1 completed.
Fantastic program, good job . We are waiting more like these !!!
Just did this, it's amazing!!! 👊👊👊
Starting today, comment under my comment to keep me doing, please! I’ll give feedback too if u want ( i have kinda 4 packs now)
I enjoy your videos and the way you explain everything so into detail, I’m just wondering if your videos also apply to women? I looked at the AthleanX for Women videos but I didn’t find it as motivating and knowledgeable as your videos.
what diet should be taken in this 22 days workout
for thouse like me that will just forgett.. just insatll an ab work out app
Ok bro see u after 22days, I'll be sure say what my results are....
Will results be faster if u take whey protein after every ab workout
Just finished day 3 of this. It's no joke. I get different extinction times for each exercise each day. Thread the needle is easily the hardest for me. Can only do 1 set.
Alright guys im gonna start day 1 and ill keep you guys updated
my first day was good. i did it a little mild. there was a little burning in stomach.
wonderful . thanks.
nice sir
No weights?
should we do warm up before doing the workout. i will start today on  20 may 2018. hope it work🙌
How to get explosive!!!
Doing it form 11 days already finding improvements awesome videos
Tried this workout today..  Now my core is in pain.. and it's hard for me to sit and poo.. maybe I'm not that fit all this time.. but I wont give up and will try it again tomorrow.. Cheers..

Do you have an AX approved personal trainer network?
Isn't it bad to workout any muscle group every day?
Why did 3.5k people not like it?
I got a wine commercial for this. Completely different things to the health
I feel pain in my mid-back when I do the heels to the heavens exercise. Why is this?
I start today!! My new job is 9-5 now and I’m sticking to this for the next few weeks and watch the World Cup in a six pack as a reward ;)
I'm planning on starting this off today. Right up till June 7th. Anyone else with me?
Hey Jeff,  could i do this challenge with an anterior pelvic tilt?  Sincerly, Roy
Hey Jeff! Your workouts are of great help. Isn’t there supposed to be a rest day in any muscle workout? Is it okay to do the ab workout everyday??
It would be so much better if you worked with us though. Throughout all the seconds and gritty stuff.
Had a super hard time doing any jack knife sit ups. Any suggestions or alternate exercises?
These are so hard but worth it
Been almost 1 year, still at first exercise.
3:00 my  man got a vein on his god damn cheek...
Sir diet plan????

You are the best
Not all heroes wear capes.
Day 1: I tried to do 3 of each with a little more rest than 10 seconds in between and it was going good until the Xman Crunches. After that I was only be to do 1 or 2. Abs and neck hurt but I'm excited to continue doing this and seeing the results. I will be updating every other day or so.
Everyday ?
This is suitable for women ?
I gonna take up this challenge!
Looks very good, but I did not clearly understand the 10seconds rest logic, do you have to rest 10sec between each series? thanks to english speakers to clarify this point.
Is this good for losing belly fat?
"... Congratulations, you just earned yourself 10 more." Sooo... we work to failure?
Im starting this today ill keep u lot updated if it works or not 22 days😱 cant wait to c results

Awesome ab workout!! Thanks for the help! This really works!!
He looks like me
My back hurts the most while doing this, is it okay!
Should I do reps or just one time pleas tell me I always  do your exercise
How many days a week?
Pumas workout wear is so ugly
Is this 22 day consecutive? Or 22 workout days? I know it’s a dumb question but I still like I have to ask.
Is this all one set or are they each broken down as a set each? If so how many sets do I do?
Should we do this after cardio or after weights?  Which is better?
Hmmm help me guys. I'll do all the instructions per day? Or one instruction per day?
Am all over this....can't wait to see the results; Jeff, thanx for sharing.
6 may 2018 I will try to complete this challenge and write my experience about that below .But I do have a lot of % fat so it will be interesting to check out results .Wish me luck :)

You are an animal. BEAST. thank you so much for sharing all of your expertise and knowledge!!
I did this for 22 days but I didint do it right so here I am still going
So every time I do the step throughs and the  thread the needles I’m staying here for about ten minutes is there a way to become more efficient with the two exercises
I keep failing super early on the jack knives lol i last about 15 seconds with terrible form
Hey bro!Tell ur exercise in Hindi too

Started May 1.. day one...hurts like hell... but I'm motivated.. will update soon
May 2nd 2018, be back on the 23rd
Hi Jeff, any muscle requires rest & repair after training. Isn't training abs & obliques for straight 22 days going to result in overtraining and weaker core???
From today to 22 days I'm doing it.. I have a pretty good amount of body fat percentage I don't have flat stomach.. I have hanging stomach.... I am going to help all those fat people by doing this .. hit me up bros
Hey Jeff a suggestion for a video is to do a your 22 days ab challenge of you walking is though it. At least a once though so we can do it and follow along with times and reps.
I have a question. How many consecutive days of this does it start to not do any good? Muscles do need rest to heal, and I have completed the 22 challenge (and even got to 30 because of the results), but it almost feels like I plateaued and I feel a bit more tired in the abs. Is a day or week rest best to throw in there? Should I shorten the consecutive days and add some days of rest to get the best results and let my abs heal a bit?
I don’t understand why 3.4k dislike this video? Lol buncha haters.
Just completed Day 1. Not that bad, as I've been doing ABS 1-2 times a week already, but damn, those Step-through planks are way harder than the rest for me for some reason.
Oki im on around day 4 or 5 not tracking too much it doesnt hurt much the days after even tho i feel like im doing enough is this a problem? And im suprised i had a 6 pack before but now im starting to see a v shape forming i highly recommend this and ill update later when i see more results
Any tips for feeling it in abs over back?
I already have a little bit of abs, but they aren't good. I will start this today and I will update it daily
If you're fat should you do this? Is this for those who want to tone their muscles? If you're fat are you considered someone with abs?
Is there anything I can do besides threading the needle, it really hurts my shoulder and elbow
I will start this tomorrow April 30th 2018. I have a flat stomach 15 drink lots of water, do cardio, and box. Let’s see what it gets me to.
Bro is this is important to get rest before next exercise
It works ! Waiting becoming a habit.
Please make video on strengthening rotator cuff bracelet, I'd supraspinatus tear 60% 2 and a half year ago, now but skeptically to hit the gym. Please help. I've already lost details of my deltoid. Also was playing badminton and have some quads muscle mass loss, not not able to play well. Please add videos to strengthen my knee, quads like athletes
I am a beginner ...can I do this for 22 days daily?
Was not that bad
How do you not rest at all for 22 days. I did it once and I have abs cramp for the next few days then after it pass I try to start again and I got cramp right after doing the first exercise twice
Finished day one felt some pain in my left shoulder , 21  more days to go, i will keep updating wish me luck
I love it but I need total body workout without equipment
Hoy many sets?
IDK how I went from funny cat compilation videos to this, but I guess we gonna try. ...Pray for me ya'll.
Btw If you do this before you eat for the day you’ll see better results. Just a tip
holy crap best abs workout i've done in a very long time. Thanks man
Ma questo pensa veramente di essere spesso??
What about the need of time for the muscles to recover? Don't abs need to be trained as every other muscle?
I have d man abs there long an thin I want blocky scary and how do I get them
Please reply respected sir
Sir please give a diet plan for this if a person is vegetarian....
I’m on Day 3. I will update you guys. i had lots of tightness in my abs and soreness and am seeing slightly more definition.
what diet should I follow while doing this program
Took me 64 days but I also had to do cardio because I had like %14 body fat
This workout is so damn challenging, but I love it!!
Today was my 22nd day! I noticed a small difference in definition but I will be going! Everyone wish me luck
I'm gonna do this for months.
Should we do this work out or the "7 minute ab" workout from Jan 2017? Thanks!
Do video on work outs for AC seperation on shoulder
How much rest between the different exercises?
Going to start this today: have a trip to Greece and Italy in 60 days.
Day one I'ma try this
Do yo take a rest day in between days or no
Thread the needle doesn't seem to work for me. Puts stress on my shoulders (rear delts), feet and back, but I don't notice any kind of ab work, not even after 4 sets. I try to get them involved as much as I can, but they don't seem to care.  I think I have a problem with planks in general, whether it's twisting pistons, tuck planks, pendulum planks, etc. my abs don't seem to care much, my shoulders, triceps, upper back and waist end up making most of the work (even when I try to remove those from the equation, my abs do little work).  I mean, the conclusion I should apparently draw from this is that I have weak abs, but truth is they aren't.  They are quite resilient, actually, so much so that I need to put weights on my ankles in order to challenge them when I do ab training.   For instance, I've been doing your 6 pack promise sore in 6 ab routine for 9 months now...(well, it's actually a sore in 12 version, since 6 minutes alone don't cut it for me). I started doing that routine without weights and at first it was challenging enough for my abs to get sore. But as time passed I noticed that my abs weren't being challenged anymore, so I started training with weighted ankle bands, it worked. Those figure 8s, windshield wipers, starfish crunches, etc. became harder to perform, and my abs were grateful (well, I was grateful, my abs were actually dying ,^^).   Now I'm training with 2kg ankle bands on each leg and I'll probably increase the weight to 3kg in the near future. Are my abs still too weak for planks? What's going on? Why is my back always trying to take all the credit?
💪😁👌
If you're a beginner and i perform this workout for 22 days straight, wouldn't it b painful by not giving rest to those abs every alternate day? They say to perform abs 2-3 times a week
That was indeed HelpFul ✌️
Thank you, thank you very much for your advice. I really appreciate it.
DAY 1 of 22 done. feelin gr8, the pain is real
The guy in the back looks a little bony
He said when you really fail to make it through this lol
Love beneficial knowledge! Appreciate you for that!
Should i do them all after eachother or should i do some other exercises which arent bothering ma abs
its gud , but still exercise is gud in limit  or u will lose face shine
I'm gonna do this for next 22 days and I will gonna tell you after 23 days...
Why is it that everyone has a different abs exercise?? Not like chest, biceps etc
Why is it that everyone has a different abs exercise?? Not like chest, biceps etc

Any suggestion for the beginner or advice

You know you are out of shape when the 7:09 of demonstration hurts.   Got a new work out toy for 22 days!  If this works, I think I am earned a date with Tracee Ellis Ross!   :-)

Hi Jeff, I am 62 and would like to know if this ab workout is strictly meant  for a younger age group or can I do it and get the same results ?  I am currently doing the "Abs after 40" workout but don't seem to be getting the results I was hoping for. Thank you Rory Gibbons
The exercices were not easy but i did not feel anything at the level of my abs it was most shoulders and back
Guys dost this work?
Hey guys, I’m a regular dude just trying to make it in this world. I recently started a YouTube channel on health and fitness check it out! My primary supplement is Crik nutrition and the benefits are great but I would spend a lot of time trying to explain them all. You guys could help me out by going to this link - - - http://crik.me/torres - - - and giving it a try, use the discount code - - - torres - - - to get %15 off!
How do you feel about weighted vest? Can you recommend some good exercises to do with it.
This made me soar
Doubt it but can people comment on this reminding me regularly so i dont forget? I really want to try this i have decent core muscles but absolutely no visable abs and i want to fix that
This helped me A LOT 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Plz plz please tel me how to recover my shoulder pain because my shoulder are injured last 3 and half  years I consult my doctor and take medication bt the result is zero Plz help me
Hello Jeff. Thanks for sharing the video. I have one question concerning the format of this workout challenge. Am I not supposed to take a day off? I'm a beginner. I thought that working out every single day is disadvantageous for the body in general, because rest gives the body the needful time to repair the muscles I'm working, correct? I'd love to start this program tomorrow, but I'm quite hesitant over my concern.
Jeff, your program was good, but it didn't make any drastic changes for me. in all fairness i threw my back out the last 2 days. I realize I need more strength to really be able to enjoy the workout. Its advanced
today Start the ab work out after 22days i will come back tell u guys what different
I am only 11 days in and I’m already proud with what I’m seeing. I feel like I’m getting a massive head start in that summer bod! I can’t wait until I can see the end results. Then I will probably continue doing it
So much knowledge and humble with it
Everyone if you want abs just go watch and try sore in 6 minutes abs from athlean’s sore in 6 min workout and just do the exercise 2 times or 3 times a week AND I GOT ABS IN THE SECOND TIME OF DOING THAT EXERCICE
Day 1 - okay let's do it          Day 22 - I look good i don't need workouts
Summer vacation coming! Gotta do that for 2 days! Anyone else???
Hi Jeff, I am a big fan and student within your program. I wanted to know if you can do a video on exercises for Fibromyalgia. This is for my wife who has been recently been diagnosed with this, along with chronic fatigue syndrome. Thanks a lot for your help.
This workout is bit difficult when you have michelin tyre tied on the tummy. I wanna see a fat guy doing this workout, that will motivate me.
Incredible workout... super impressed with jeff's ability to include people of all levels in this genius workout
Ayo I’m going to start this I’ll update you guys every week
Ayo I’m going to start this I’ll update you guys every week
I love this! I need what you have to offer about training for maximum results! You are a God send! Especially because my hips are locked and I can bare lift my legs to get in my car or go up my stairs. Can you do a video detailing workouts for people who stand for 10 to 16 hours a day. I stand on concrete 10 to 12 hours a day as a Customer Service Advisor. Thank you and God bless!
starting next monday, i'm gonna start doing this, not sure if the entire routine at once but still i've started to notice by abs are starting to get a little bloated, that needs a fix, now Edit: after doing heels to heaven's for the first time, i was rolling in pain, it hurt like a bitch, but for some reason i'm dying to do it again, the pain went away as fast as it came
How much min days required to atleast get lil shape of abs ?
*12th April*, I will start today, Will keep everyone updated, lets go :)
I've been doing it for about a month now. It's really nice. Tho I have problems doing alternate jack knives. Plus I already had some abs showing when I started this workout so it's showing great results for me. (I'm a 9% body fat lean guy)
Sir how can I remove bone fat??
Thanks for this video, I finally found some exercises to activate my whole core more, so helpful thank you again
22 days?? in a row????   I'm on day 3 and with no rest for muscle repair how is one expected to improve?
Day 1 completed, but the last 3 exercises I couldn't even finish the first extinction round. Hopefully that changes over time
Hey there I love these videos. I injured both rotators and was wondering if there’s an alternative to the “needle and thread” exercise?
Thanks so much
This is all i needed
So I tried the first one he showed at 2:00 yesterday and holly crap my stomach is hurting today. I tried the thread the needle one but my balance is way off. Definitely a lot better then the machines. Thank you for your videos.
May i ask? What does it mean by 45sec but no rest? Does it mean that if i can still do it,ill do another 45sec right after completing a 45 sec?
alternating jack knives is so hard ...
would this work if i still had a belly?
I’m 12 and I’m ready to start working for my future
I'm gonna write this down
Does abs affect the chest growth ?
no homo but this dudes physique is a 10/10
this guy is a 🐐
Brother this workout plan has changed me entirely and my whole life. Iam so thankful to you that I can't express in words BRO..
Two days in. I’ve already seen some results! I do my normal weight training then HIIT for 10 15 minutes then this ab workout. Let me tell ya, it is bomb! I’m actually started looking forward to do this tomorrow. I’m so damn excited!
I’m gonna track my progress on here
Day 1 in the book. Ouch!
after a while from starting doing them i feel a terrible preassure on my spine which makes me totally want to stop because i can feel like if'd snap, what could i do
Top 5 in my list of trainers one of the best workout channel on Youtube..
To everyone in consideration no it’s not fake I started 22 days ago and got my results yesterday I was shocked I have a V now my abs are certainly more visible and I have stronger Abs if that’s a thing
Thanks bro!!! Most deff trying this!!
worked for me
Challenge accepted!! Day 1
nice i really liked this workout because there is no excuses NONE!!!!!!! so when i show this to my friends  there is no denying because of some random excuse that there try to make up xD
Intense workout. I've been looking for my go-to routing. This is a top 5 for sure. Another one I'm liking is called Body Weight Beast if anyone is interested. https://tinyurl.com/yc4gw58m
I'm a professional soccer player, and I've been searching for ways to improve my athletic ability for quite some time. This guy has been so helpful.   He's explains each exercise very clearly, and they are super easy to follow. No equipment needed for this core work out, and it is so much more isolated to the ab and obliques area than any machine at the gym!   Dude gets a thumbs up from me!   Thank you!
Let's do this! Done exercises 1 &5 2 times the others were pretty difficult especially the planks. Awesome workout, much better than what I've been doing before
Can i have a six pack abs within a month?
Any advice on how to avoid lower back pain after and throughout this workout? Experiencing a bit even on a thick gym mat. Thanks!
He is the best man one of the fitniss!!!!! Thank you...
painful but worthy...needed for running resistance.
Super
I’m new to this working out shit so can someone tell me if you are supposed to do this everyday or how does the scheduling work?
Well. . . Let's see how far I get into this.
Why would anybody give this video a thumbs down?  Its top class.
I will give it a try. Just tryed it... it is hard man.
I didn't understand how the rounds work...please sb respond...
I like this routine, been using it for a few weeks now, not doing it every day tho, maybe about 3 times a week
ALL your video are EXCELLENT!! Great information, great exercises, you are very explanatory but concise! NO BS, love it! THANK YOU!
Going to this integrate this in my 30 minutes workout. WILL UPDATE YOU GUYS WITH MY RESULTS😀
Is it normal to do abs workouts every day ?
Great ab routine and tips
nice
its not working
Should you work your abs(with these 6 exercise) DAILY? Because I read somewhere in bodybuilding forum that it would lead to abs overtraining and twice a week should suffice. Someone please guide me
I don't understand how someone can train abs everyday. I just can't do I think I'm gonna need rest days to recover
I'm really gonna start giving updates. Day 1 starts tomorrow. Stay tuned for updates.

Guys did it work?😯
How to punch harder
Needful tips...
No rest???? Wtf?
Hi Jeff! My name is James and I love watching and learning new exercises and I find yours always seem to go that much further then everyone else's to meet my goals.  My question is I have two artificial hips and I have a bit of a hard time with some of the twisting and turning, is there something a little different that you could show me I am trying to target my  abdomen  area as that is a little large lol.
I had a six-pack before i started this. Now i got eight. #Ripped
Hello Jeff, this looks like an amazing program. I’m 15 and do circuit training 5 days a week (10x4 push-ups, 19x4 squats, 9x4 pull-ups with resistance band and 7x4 push-ups on bars). In your video you say that the workout needs to be done 22 days in a row. Wanted some advice from you, on how you would combine my two training variations. Just do abs and circuit training at once or differently?
Thanks I'll give it a try
I usually strain my neck during such workouts. How do I avoid it?
like Jeff is doing, you should breath with your chest always keep your belly in while you breathe in every rep. Dont let your belly go out when you breathe while training abs.
Don’t mind me, just watching this video while eating ice cream
Nice ..easy exersize
Hey! I didn't understood the sequence like how do you make it more difficult everyday. Please Reply.
starting now..
Burns like hell
https://youtu.be/vipheARav2I
is this a good exercise for teenagers
Will you please make a video on 1. what we strictly dont have to eat to gain abs or muscles? 2. myths 3. what we can consume in limited amount?
Im doing this for the couple of days and i can see the results thanks man!
Have been doing all his abs exercises and seriously I got results within 3 weeks!
I will keep everyone posted! I just started today and my abs burn so much already! My workout routine contains running for 20 minutes and this 22 day ab workout. I also will be intermittent fasting during the whole 22 days. I will post pictures at the end if you want. Thanks!
Please someone tell me im 13 will abs workout effect my intestine
What is your age sir
Been doing this for 5 days now. Have alot of muscle pain. Am Athletic 67 kgs.. Is it fine to continue.... Just little worried.. I can push till 22 days
Day 1
I don't think I do planks right. I can't seem to activate my core. I feel it with all other ab work outs. But for some reason I can't figure out planks. Really noticed this with thread the needle.
How many sets have to do ?
Will this make my penis bigger ?
Plz tell me from which part of my body  I will start my exercise from Monday to Sunday  and diet to make like ur body
I’ve been doing this for 2 weeks now and I can start seeing really good improvement! For the step through planks, I can do those for ever it doesn’t hurt at all. I can feel the workout in the abs once I’m done but it doesn’t hurt. The only reason why I move on is because my arms get very tired doing those workouts and not my abs. Same goes for the altering thread the needle. I don’t know if I’m not doing them right or not, I try to rewatch the video many times and try to listen to what you say but I never really feel the burn. Also kind of same for the Heals to the Heavens, X-man crunch, and the altering jack knives. I can feel the burn in these very good but what I found out is once of the reasons I stop is because my neck hurts, or my legs are giving up after the 3-5 time I’ve redone the workout. I’m only 14 and I just really needed to know before I keep doing this but I’m doing it wrong the whole time. Thanks!
So will these exercise help me burn my belly fat n get abs??😕
I read it somewhere the particular body part needs 48 hour rest after exercise.........right or wrong...?
great video. this will give me something to do and i will profit for it.
So on day 2 when your sore from day 1 do I do less and then go back up where I can as the recovery catches up?
Has anyone successfully completed this?
Note  ° heels to the heaven (45 sec)  ° Step through plank (45 sec)  ° X man Crunch (12 reps)  ° Alternating thread needle (10 each side)  °Alternating jack knifes (45 sec)  ° Stationary bikes (30 sec)
PUMA PANTS WITH NIKE SHOES SUCH A STYLE SIN
Thanks.
Can you mix this routine with a cardio routine ? Or is it too much exercise ?
Well Iam only 13 do u think Imma gonna make it already have abs but need more to pump up
I'm on my 13th day and I'm seeing abs !!
Nobody is getting away with an easy workout here! I really love this dude's attitude! hahaha
These exercises are so hard to figure out how to do them. Couldn't you make simpler ones?
Starting today I'ma up date every week
Just completed this man.... wasn't even able to last 10 seconds in the last exercise
Jinder mahal...
Those jackknifes are the real deal
I want abs like faze censors not like yours
0:46 Me after my workout(not jeff_look at back)😅
jeet selal asthetics
👌👌👍👍
Could some one explain me why I can't hold my feets in the air while doing the alternating jacknifes? I guess is my lower back because it curves while I'm trying to maintain the feets in the air... ??? i'm really struggling to mantain both feets in the air ): pls help <3
what im confused about is that he said in another vid that workouts shouldnt take more than 10 mins, but this takes me half an hour.
Thank you for this video you are a truly inspirational person you have helped me get over the wall I couldn't get over
I swear his chest size throws off his hole "thing".
Starting today after school, Ima try this during the summer as well.
Does this thing work?
fuckin hell.... that was hard.  Thanks for this.
how many reps?
My back hurts when I do the second one
thank you for this video!
Thank you
Not sure what day, missed a couple cause of work. Today got 2 sets of heels to heavens, 2 sets of step through planks, Actually got all 10 each side of Thread the needle. 1 set of Alt jacknifes, 1 set of stationary bike. Still freaking brutal!
Is this workouts will lead us to get the ripped packs
Day 3. Can't move...
Sounds great I’m gonna try
I'm on Day 6.  I've noticed a couple things.  First, my abs are definitely showing signs of improvement.  I've been watching my diet and incorporating resistance and cardio training, so I'm working on the whole package.  Second, some exercises are easier to do on some days than others.  I'm not freaking out that heels to heaven were tough yesterday because I was able to do more on Thursday.  On the other hand, I did more stationary bike reps yesterday than the previous day.  It all balances out.  The key is committing to the plan for 22 days.
Sir how to increase my height my age 17 year old & my height 5'3" please reply
Starting a bit later today. Anyone want any updates just ask
Hey Jeff, I’ve noticed everytime I do a workout similar to rhe stairs to the heavens my hips will pop on the way back down. Any ideas what’s causing this or what I can do to fix it?
Nice Video I'ii definitely gave this Video a tray
I’ve been doing this for 1 week now and the best exercise that works the best is the x-men crunch it burns but does amazing work
Please give me a video of make six pack abs in only 5 days
https://youtu.be/Bru-o_8em6U  Please watch this abs workout best abs workout for everyone
I like it..
I AM ONLY 10 YEARS OLD CAN I GET IT
This workout go crazy
hii , i am trying that 22 abs workout, but some of that exercises are too dificult! Is it okay if i change , for example, de x-men or the alternating jackknife for v-ups? other example,  the alternating thread the needle or the step through planks , for 50 sec regular plank? Ty ;)
22 is my number! Have to do it!
Ow May bud I have 8 pack thanks
While doing body weight extinction style, should we stick to one muscle group one day or hit all in the same day?
When I do it my Bally pumps like a balloon...is it normal or am I doing it all wrong
how frequent should you do these workouts per day in these 22 days?  once / twice a day?
Rest=Food that is what messes us up
I just completed day one , 21 days left
Im 12 can i do iy
excellent ! thanks ! new abs ! good !
Going to start it from today . Will see the results after 22 days . Thank u man for sharing this with us .
How to height increase
Can I continue my normal workout in addition to this???
Great abdominal work out!! Can't wait I have the V shape already and my top 2 abs show but I hate working abs
Day 1: definitely thought it would be easier. Is excessive farting normal?
I thought, one should always train his back together with the abs?!
I was wanting to know I fear that I am over working out and not letting my muscles grow properly could I be able to do say 1 day all trap work out and the next day do some bench press so that my traps rest and grow? And then switch back on the 3rd day so ever other day mixing it up, if that makes any sense
Finally dressed ready for this workout. Sitting on my yoga mat typing this scrolling down the comments watching this video. Oh well I will start tomorrow. Mostly likely I won't. Exercise is so hard
This is the truth. I thought this would be easy. I'm used to doing crunches only and 3 minutes of this has changes that.
Day 7 - 2 sets of Heels to heaven, 1 set of step through planks (very tough), 1 set X man crunch, Actually completed the Thread the needle set, 10 each side without collapsing, 1 set of Alt jacknifes, and 2 sets of Stationary Bike. First time I made it through the complete work-out without collapsing. 14 more days to go. Actually seeing some definition in my abs, as I have increase cardio, and have reduced calories. By faith, I will have a six pack by the end of this thing.
I’ll give this program a shot, I honestly just want a stronger core so I can squat/deadlift more proficiently
Will start it from today. Will give daily updates.
💪👍

👍👍
Awesome!!!
After reaching extinction how long do you wait until starting the next exercise?
I will start from the morning. will do this and tell you the change. love from India. thanks
My question is should I do this after my weight training? I’m usually pretty damn tired and this looks pretty tiring as well. But I’m not gonna skip out on my regular weight training
I remember seeing a video where Jeff demonstrated with an analogy using meat the detrimental effects of over training, he showed a horribly burnt piece of meat which represented what would happen to your muscles if you didn't give them ample rest between exercise's. I have heard the same thing before from others and it's really easy to grasp common sense but this seems to contradict that, how could doing 22 days of the same exercise's on the same muscles all in a row without rest days not be over working them? cause If I am to start this I wanna make sure I'm not just making my abs weaker by doing it.
Jacknifes are killing me 🔪😄
Can I do this daily?
200,000 likes, that's insane.  WELL DONE JEFF!
sorry how losing fat belly actually work

This works so well thanks
Sir plzz tell me Exercise for hand srength Without equipment
Do I just do this in one go? As in do I do this for like more then one 1 set? Or is it exercise 1, rest, exercise 2, rest, etc.?
my shoulders hurt more than my stomach does 😢 i want to rip them out 😥🥉
Man I suck at this. I started this few days ago and a)Heels to Heavens 45 seconds 1 round, b) Step through plank (could not do more than 15 seconds), c) X man crunch (8-10 reps), d) Alternating thread the needle (6 reps), e) Jackknifes (5-6 seconds! not great form), f) stationary bikes (20 seconds)
days 3 from FRANCE
I can see two out of six abs. I'm doing this daily for sure.
Starting this today.
Thank you very much... this is helping me at a much greater extent⚠️⚠️⚠️ need more!
3:30, House Bolton approved.
https://youtu.be/_wMlL2-WDRs my transformation
Ok, so I got through this sort of. Only 45 secs on each. Looking forward to day 2!
If I eat clean and I already have a low body fat percentage can I get visible abs by the end of these 22 days?
https://youtu.be/WpGXf7dHtT4
So..day 4 just complete ,abs hurt like fuckin hell and couldnt move from the floor for about 7 mins and im pretty sure i had a mild stroke other than that everything seems to be going well so far
I've been doing it for some time now, I keep progressing on the first few ones but I just do more and I'm always tired for the last few and can never push past the second set. Should I try rearranging the order I do them in?
I do steriods
Hey Jeff, I just saw this and wanna try it out. Problem is, I'm already exhausted after my (1 hour) workouts and this looks like it'll sap me.  Is it still a good idea?
abs workout reduces muscle gain???
I'm gonna update this every once in 2 days
hai!thanks for the work out im doing gym work outs daily so should i do these workout with the same time as my general work out or at someother time on the same day
THAT A Very good channel I loved it
Going to do my best at this abs workout! Thanks!!
Who else want an app by Jeff?? All workouts plan😍
So essentially, there is next to NO rest at all with this whole workout?

I am updating everyday, roast the fuck out of me if I don’t! Let’s go
Can you tell how to increase your ability?? I've just started working out and cannot complete all the exercises. I am getting exhausted too soon..
What should you start doing after you finish 22 days??
I m 15 can it work for me ?
Thx man

Yo weird question does anybody know the name of the nike shoes he is wearing I would really appreciate it
Day six boi🏋🏼‍♀️🏋🏼‍♀️🏋🏼‍♀️🏋🏼‍♀️!!!!!
Starting this workout today, let’s see how it goes
Me at night : im going to gym tommorow  Next day : get your ass back at bed
it's not the best
I have Diastatis Recti after 3 pregnancies. will these excercises help or harm? my Chiro told me I have to do certain excercises that will strenghten my abs ....
can you please tell me what kind of foods I have taken during this period
Nice
What Nike's was he wearing?
Can you get abs with 20% body fat?
No rest days?
Is this exercise will lower my belly fat
Is it good for a 13 year old, is this exercises good for a kid
I'm just trying to lose weight in my midsection  along with the ab workout, I need to diet right? And Cardio? But I'm not trying to lose no muscle mass or strength can you give me some advice?
Wonderful...
Does the order of the exercises matter?
Thanks dude I use to weight 90 now I weight 71 pond's
how to make chest
Very bad exercise
We up for the Jeffrey
Very nice sir
Question to Jeff What is your average body fat please?
how many set in one day
Sir
Its true
The reverse jackknife makes me so fucking mad because I can't do it I can't keep my legs straight my legs just flail
Everytime i try to do the thread the needle my shoulder blades pop and it hurts any tips?
Build strength, while bulding strong muscles. How can I do that?
How many sets we have to do for each exercise
Do you have a video addressing ways to correct Diastasis Recti? I haven’t been doing much lately but I’m getting back into things and noticed things like leg lifts cause the center of my abdomen to bulg. It has always done that but seems to be worse now.
What can i do to get better
hes on roids
Super workout bro thanks for the video..  U can really see my core pain
good job man love the vids
How old are you bro?
I wanna say that I did this challenge for 24 days straight and I gotta say that I am definitely looking and feeling better. You’re not going to get shredded like this guy is but I can definitely see a little bit of abs coming in and smaller stomach. I of course mixed these abs with other workouts so I wasnt doing just this and I was watching what I ate. I plan on continuing this routine
Jeff is the G.O.A.T

Burning workout!! Today is a first challange day!!:)
Just about to start this challenge 💪🏼
Hi, Thank you for all the info and guides ! A very good and easy to understand and follow video, however I'm just now recuperating after a broken humerus and I cant use my left arm at all and I would like to keep the use of my right arm as minimal as possible to bring them up together once my left one is healed that being said I would still like to go over abs exercises but some that dont involve the movement and using my arms as rests for my body. Can you please help out with a few exercises that I can follow keeping in mind what I stated above? Thank you so much
what should eat
Plz can u make a video about smoking and bodybuilding ? Thnx 😃
मराठीत बोल ना भाऊ
This guy target indian
Ok guys, from tommorow 04.02.2018, I will try to complete this challenge. I will keep you guys updated if you'd like (pinky swear). May God have mercy upon my soul.
That step thru plank requires excellent hip mobility. There are other variations for those who aren't a perfect specimen of the human body.
Nice
i am going to take that 22 day abs challenge and sir i am also send u pic  after that i will comments on program
best video.. thanks. I tried it.. Amazing

Is it ok to do this daily? Don't you need to let the muscle fibers to repair?
What about your LEGS Man!
Does this help in getting rid of belly fat?
Do you have a full body work out using cords? I have the that latch on the top and bottom of the door?
Going for this, this February. Thanks Jeff, for putting this up, and looking forward to doing this!
Hey I am having exertion headache during workout, please help, please.
I have abs, just that my fat is covering them. When I lay back or when i lay back and curve my back you can feel all of my abs. It's weird but they feel like pizza slices (the squared ones). What I'm trying to say is that I guess I have abs but they're covered by body fat, Imma do this and keep you guys updated. It may be easier for me than it is for others but I'll try to keep you guys updated 👌
Like ur shoes...
This hurts good. Is a tough workout.
Was doing it for 3 months and I stopped now because I started going to the gym and I feel soar after it, just tired.. nevertheless.. 3 months no brakes this exercise did start to grow muscle in my belly although it's not popped out much, only the higher part near to chest, the rest is just seems like making better shape. Working only one part of the body won't work, you need to do chest exercises as well.. I think 1 year, max 1 day brake a week can make you a six pack no doubt about it, it takes time.. Basically... you tell your self to do it for a year or no chance you make it..
i met with an accident 2yrs back . now i cant fold my right leg more than 90  degree bec of my knee cap surgery suggest me workouts that can reduce my belly ...
u r the best!!!
I've been doing it wrong
Thank you, Jeff. You are the real helper!!!
My back cracks and it hurts 😞
Does he mean you do this every day?
Just started today I will do it into the summer if i can
I suck at heels to heavens
This guy has tons of money to pay for YouTube ads
How long is the rest time between each consecutive exercise?
Thanks for all the great content. Stuff works.
he looks like Michael Phelps
I appreciate learning some new ab exercises but, am I just supposed to simply go to failure or have someone standing by with a timer so I know where I am progress-wise?  I would also be interested in knowing why I shouldn't take rest days for abs.
this shit actually works!!  So proud of me for not getting called skinny anymore! Thank you! (15 tho)
Yes it's work,,  But IAM feeling little pain in my abs is this normal? Sir please reply me
As i start Day One  Heels to the heavens 45 seconds  Step through planks 45 seconds  X-men crunch 12........ I thought its easy lol Alternating thread the needle 10 to each side  Alternating Jackknifes 45 seconds  Stationary bikes 30 seconds
i am a complete beginner and i need the fastest abs workout (2 months at the most) to see the results.. no worries i have the motivation to go through.. thanks
Ok. I’ve been doing Ab exercises for a while and will add this to the routine for 22 days. See if there will be changes to the lower belly fat. Currently at 15% BF.
Started today jan 29th lets do this will keep y’all updated !
Holy crap!  I am going to do this.  Today, January 28, 2018 is my first day.  I will let you know how I did February 18th
It does not take 22 days to adapt to a habit
Talkative professor  ! My ears burn out!  3 wps  !   ( 3 word per second came out from his mouth ! ) uuh !
Are we supposed to control our diet too?
Strating today will upload everyday
Hi. I did my first one today.  Do we need to do this everyday ? Or every alternate day so that ab muscles don’t fatigue ?
How many sets of each workout are you doing?
Awesome, great workout
hi i have been working out from last one year and i do 10 abs workout of 100 set each 1s a week still unable get abs. can you plz suggest me what should i do to get abs
Im gonna try this out for sure
Great stuff I am taking this challenge on next month for 22 days
Does this work?
should you be flexing in your abs while doing these exercises?
No girl choose six pack over 6 cars, so stop going to gym go to work.
The skeleton in the background is me after doing these workouts   Love these! Awesome exercises!
Does this work?
I’m a skinny teen and after doing this for a month I got a four pack definitely worth it
A hell of a lot harder than it looks but worth it! I started at 5'11-220lbs with a 36-waist. A full month in and I'm at 205lbs (which was my goal/fight weight) and I'm in the weird between size of 32-34 waist. Thank you so much. I should add that I did this twice a day. Early morning as soon as I wake up then again in the evening after work
Jeff, 1st try of this circuit today, only realised most of the exercises among the 6 I can't even do the correct form, it's quite hard for me whom is having weak core. I used to have strong core cuz I trained and everyday, but after I stopped workout for 1 year now feels like starts all over especially my core.
Damn! You da man, Jeff! Those exercises are Fun!!  Day1. Beginner.  Heals to heavens 45s &  30s  (this was FUN!) Step thrus 45s & done (I couldnt get my form right, hopefully tomorrow!) X man: 12 reps. /35s (Seemed easy, will watch form tomorrow) Thread Needle: 10 each side Ooh Haaard! Shoulder. 😬😬 Jack Knife: 45s Form is tough to maintain Stationary Bikes 30s Tough.  Felt most punch from the first two exercises. Let's see how it goes tomorrow.  Cheers!
Can you do a video showing how to widen upper body?(chest, shoulders, back)

In a day how many time we should  do workout
I love this thank you so much. do you do any really good cardio routines to burn fat
Anyone know what shoes he's wearing they look really good for intense sport
Vehle hai
This is great thank you so much, I have been stuck with a 4 pack for too long. And I know this will get me to a 6 pack
I found this video helpful, also some info from Specforce  Abs was a lot of help. http://freepremiumebooks.com/download/?report=6principlesfor6packabs_2imyaf787i
Day 1: Could barely do 2-3 of the exercises before being done for the day. And still covered by fat, but feel sore.
I haven’t worked out In a while and completed all of them some of them doing It 3x... but that being said it doesn’t mean it’s easy. It activated the heck out of all my abs and I feel It. The key is to push yourself till you can’t anymore. Great workout or “drills”
I didnt know robert Lewandoski had a youtube channel?😂
One of, if not the best videos on YouTube!!
What is the best way to keep timing while working out?
hi sir i am an indian want to get the diet plan for abs .
Hola, from chile  How many reps i have to do of each exercise? Thanks
Nice 👍
Im gonna call this Day 0- screwed half the workouts up enough for them to be easy, day 1, i fixed them. Updates to come on the ab part. Not the total amount of each workout i can do
Wow
Going to work this program
Thank you for the videos always so much info
my abs hurt before I even  started.  and now I'm realizing how much I actually use my abs through the day cause now really hurt.

What's the rest period between excercises? He says take a 10 second break If you reach extinction But I don't think he specifically mentions rest periods between excercises?
What if I already work out, do I work out      Twice a day now?
So what happens after the 22 days
Want v cut abs
Hi Jeff, for a beginner what do you suggest single muscle workout or double muscle?
I love this guy 💪🏾
While doing these ab exercises there's a lot of pressure on the neck. Any tips on doing it without causing tension in neck or any modifications without involving neck movement?
This is one of the best workout vids I've seen
Who thinks I can do this bere inmind only 12
My god, this guy is so ripped.... Goals for days!

Thanks for this bro
Wow!!!!! Thanku
First day done! My abs were melting like a mf, 21 more days + I’ll post legit updates
Hey guys. Going to be doing this for the 22 days and posting my results for every day below. I will post a before and after picture on the last day as well.
day 2 done !!
Day 2 done..2X
I have a metal plate in my ulna and one in my radius of my left hand. I do exercises daily, but my left-hand stings a little when I do exercises like push-ups, could you recommend a few exercises that are effective, but something that wouldn't put too much strain on my hand.
Jeff can you pls teach us a way to train our legs without heavy squats?  7 knee surgeys and I need to work them without strssing my joints.  You are truly a pro!!!
I am recovering from recent surgeries for a fractured right hip (total hip replacement and broken femur was reattached) and s spinal fracture(Fractured disc was removed, spine was fused and set with screws and bracket). The surgeons both told me my power lifting career was over and recommended not lifting anymore. I competed successfully in power lifting for 20 yrs and I am depressed that I should stop the activity. Any recommendations? Is this ab routine safe for me to implement? I don't want to go under the knife again
Doing this, will do this every day and give updates every 3 days and on the final day.
Day 1 complete...2X
I feel like i did have of the workouts wrong

My bell button pains but its work and burns to
Video starts at 1:50
where did you get them puma pants from ??
THANK YOU!
Curving your back in some of the excises isn't good for your spine.
i will suggest.. talk specific and work more
I'm excited to try these moves! Thanks!
day 5, my abs still didn't recover from day 1... laughing hurts... I'm regretting this
I am a 12 year old girl and plan on keeping at this challenge. I have great ab muscle but they are not visible. I hope I get a stronger core and more strength, along with visible results. I will try my best to update every day.  Heels To Heaven: Round 12, Not to hard, Good Form  Step Through Planks: Round 1, Bad Form and was kinda burned out from the first workout.   X Man Crunch: Round 1, Good Form.   Alternating Thread The Needle: Couldn’t even finish round 1, Form wasn’t the best.  Alternating Jacknives: Round 1  Stationary Bikes: Round 13, good Form, felt like I could go forever so I stopped. I know that’s not how it’s supposed to be done and that will be the last time I do that.
Easy
I've lost 102 lbs and am looking into starting work on my abs. I think that I'll start as a beginner. And as much as it seems like too much effort. With the help of your awesome video, I WILL DO IT!!!! Mannnnnnnnnn this video is awesome now I've watched more of it!!! :)
That's good work thankful for your efforts
Definition of a timeless video
Guys crunches are bad for you, they ruin your spine
Saw your video for the first time yesterday and started doing 4 of the 6 today. Wanted to continue for long time...
I'm a girl can I still do this? I want toned, sexy abs, it's kinda hard to explain, NOT a masculine six pack like he has. Would I be better off with a workout aimed at women?
Very Useful Mr.Jeff
I've been doing it for 12 days and my left shoulder are killing me. Have to stop for a week. Now im back on day 5 of this routine, gonna restart. It was really painful during thread the needle. And during the xmen my back is killing me, but my abs are just fine. If not for my back, i can do more set. Any advice?
Man I can’t get that x-man crunch. I feel like I’m doing it wrong because I can’t help but bend my knees and I get the most pain in my lower legs
how many day a weak getting abs workout
I'm a beginner and this is my first ab exercise  First exercise : felt burn in my lower back (can do this for a long time so stopped at 2 sets) Second: didn't feel much anywhere Third: More burn and soreness in my abs than I've felt in my entire life. Fourth : cant keep balance so skipped this. Fifth : Holy shit burned Sixth: Roasted abs Touched my abs and they were literally sooo HOT holy fuck Jeff is a genius
Hello. I' ve started today this programm. I gonna be updating every day. Kinda amateur on abs workout. Promise to be here till day 22.  Day 1: 1) Heels to the heaven : 45 secs  (2 rounds) -> Not to hard             2) Step through planks : 45 secs (1 round)             3) X man crunch : 12 reps -> hard             4) Alternating thread the needle -> 8 to each side -> burn             5) Alternating jackknifes -> Kinda 30 secs -> Really hard + without the best execution             6) Stationary bikes -> 30 secs (1 round) -> Maybe i could last one more  Exercise to exercise break time : 10-15 secs I've never done again any of these exercises, so i need a little bit practise for better execution, especially at (2) and (5) exercises.
I wonder how long it took the guy in the back to reach extinction?
The guy in the background got extinct
Can you do a video for a perpetual leg workout to avoid unbalance in one's muscle growth??
Haha next day😏. I am starting right now 😆😆
Aren't crunches bad?
lets go boys
Starting today guys! lets do thisss
Instead of doing the thread the needle is there any other good exercise to replace it?  If so can someone give me an alternative for it?
It takes 66 days to form a habit, Just to let you know...
My abs are so strong I never got to the step through plank
My legs are sore
How much rest do we get after each excercise?
Can I do this if I have belly fat?
This exercise will effect hight ?
That skeleton is Jesse after doing this workout
can i do this workout daily along with  gym ?
I like pizza
What about the breath in or out while raising legs in 1st exercise pls tell
Thanks man for that Bad ass exercise, I'm gonna go for that!!!! But actually I have a problem tho.. What should be the diet with that exercise.... Please let me know....
Day 1 lets get it

Thanks a ton. .. will try it right away.
Trust me this workout is absolutely bomb...I did it for a month and straight from the 15 day I started seeing result ...now I keep doing it with little variations or even some weights .. Thank you for this amazing workout Jeff Sir
I couldn't do it 😞 , I'm 5ft 8 and weigh 148 pounds I really want a six pack I usually don't eat to terrible but not ideal either I'm not fat but not skinny and I have these love handles that I hate with a passion what can I do to improve ??
I will see you all on January 22
Was cocky day 1 and did double sets on 4/6. Day 2 just almost killed me on one of each haha. Thanks for the great content!
Liked this video. My question is how good are crunches for abs workout??
It seems a lot of people didn't grasp the idea and think this is just for 22 days.
0:46 you see that skeleton in the back that's me after his workout
Where i came from people call fats as backup.
Steroid freaks need to stop making workout videos
Abs are in pain!! Awesome workout!! Cheers bro

I recently had a shoulder repair for my labrum. I was a 3 sport athlete prior to this but I haven't been able to work out like I use too. im currently 2 1/2 months out from surgery and I'm wondering if anyone has any modifications to ab workouts
2K dislikes? Go figure!

Hi Jeff!

What about rest? The science says to give muscles rest if you want them to grow
The guy behind you has 0 percent fat. We have to follow his instructions.
Great workout I got sore the first time I tried it
If anyone did this and it worked pls comment on this and say that
Should i do it if i have fat over stomach and chest
Im starting it right now. gonna be updating
Can you do another video for I can listen because this is not giving me a good workout so I mean you to help me
This is the workout I've been looking for.  Doing this 2x a day. Can't wait until day 22.
some exercises cause major problems to our body. but,  I got new training which doesn't affects to our health and got 6six packs I'm very happy with this because I made it  without going to gym also not even taking single sit-ups. try out. https://bit.ly/2yinCoO  when we take exercise for abs at gym. some of us usually get disk problem. but this training is absolutely for you don't waste your valuable time by going to gym and paying monthly fee I hope this will help you as it helped me   do you know how hard I worked to get abs. approx it took 4months but it doesn't worked then I heard of this training and finally it succeeded. now I'm very happy with this result in the first week☺.  https://bit.ly/2yinCoO
Hmmmm it's a very advanced exercise
Supper workouts
This is ab workout made fun. FUCK YEA  Edit: This was horrible, im in so much pain
Jeff I currently weigh 162. I am 5'9". Been training about 6 months. I have seen great results. My top two rows of abs are showing but I still have a thin layer of fat.how much more should I lose?
Is it ok  to do intense core work outs 3 times a day?
Also is it possible to reverse a hernia through losing weight and strengthening the abs?
Hi Jeff.   I am 49 and I am getting back into fitness.   My issue is I have a small hernia above my belly button.  How can I work out my abs without making it worse.
Guys I wanna try this today on 12/12/17 and I will update weekly about my abs
Plz bring up no equipment exercise for biceps and chest and legs too,, i like ur programs very much

Wow bro 🙋‍♂️💙🕺💖🏆🔥💪💚
Sometimes I get a strong temporary headache after abs exercises. I really focus on my breathing but it still happens. Would you recommend something to prevent this from happening?
Oh every time I try and do the first one my tail bone? (area above the ass crack) hurts I think I have apt would that cause pain?
Y is my veigns poping out near the v shape part of my belly idk how to explain it

Thanks for your lovely tips
I've been following you for years now buddy, this challenge is awesome to get your ab training on track after you've fallen off a bit. I will continue to support and share this channel with everyone. Thank you Jeff.
First of all I want to ask you .. can I follow your instruction? I am skinny fat.. and I am going to gym for one months ago.. please if you read my comment please reply me.. i am waiting
Im gonna do this aditional to my workout.
So I’m supposed to do this for 22 days straight?3rd day in and my abs are already sore af.
This the type of body I want not like those huge bodybuilder looks disgusting just want ripped and lean like this guy simple
I am starts from today when I got this?
I’m gonna start this so in about 23 days I might post a video about the results wish me luck and please help me stay motivated!   (Turn on post notifications to be notified once I upload the vid)
Please help. I can't help my lower torso going forward while doing alt. Jacknifes. No matter how hard I try, my back is in arc and belly is really forward. I'm a skinny person.
ill  try this oné
So is it normally good to train abs that often though? I mean they are growing stronger when they rest right. Do they fully heal overnight?
Man I just did this. Wow my stomach was on fire. These next 22 days will be interesting
Are kids meant to be doing this because I'm only 10
Nice I will do that

Tell me the best exercises for the hips & thiegh
Hi! I just got your app 6pack... is there any chance you have something for women? For leg and butt... thanks!
Started today, November 14th, let's see how it goes.
Should you make 10sec pause between the exercises too, or you can take a breath for a min or two?
Damm  thats good
I'm having a fat belly, if I start these exercises will I get a flat stomach on the 22th day or if I start today when wil I get flat abs
After I did these I’ve got a back pain how to fix that
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
I need some guidance, my bro is really good at cutting but he's not all about abs so I would appreciate it. I'm 5'7 180 barely started my diet today and I'm a football player who barely finished the season. I also have pretty decent biceps and strength overall, but the point is I'd like to know how to get some awesome abs without losing my muscle mass so I was wondering if I should do low seconds high interval sprints to not lose my mass, and also what to eat when I get hungry and if I should  enter a caloric deficit or not, or if I should just eat healthier and equally the same calories and continue to do these workout daily. And the most important question actually would be how to lower my body fat percentage to show abs while at the same time keep my muscle mass... I would appreciate anyone who knows their stuff to reply or if by some awesome luck have the YouTuber and the expert in health and fitness help me out, thank you!
I don't feel it in my core on the second exercise. I've been having to give up because of the stress on my arms
The first exercise put pressure on my lower back when I push it upwards
Speaking of rest... There have been some recent (2014, 2016) studies by Schoenfeld, Henselmans and others, which suggest that longer (2.5 min) inter-set rest periods allow for more hypertrophy and muscle strength than shorter (0.5-1.0 min) inter-set rest periods. Could you do a video on inter-set rest periods?
Day 1 complete I'll try to keep you guys posted on results
Can i loose fat with this exercise i mean work out on this video...
Nice shirt bro.
Buy a shirt lol
I think this is the first time my abs are sore even the day after
Jeff, I've enjoyed your workout videos, and I'm a huge fan of some of your informative videos. I think that it is incredible to put the science back into the workout the way that you do, however I have one more request to put your skills to the test. I have had an appendectomy. What is the best way to exercise the abs and lastly squats or legs without hurting myself?
So fine
First start your 22 days by eating right You will naturally lose not wanted fat. After that,  you  could start your 22 days Abs workout. You'll see quicker   results.
Hey, is it okay if my lower back getting tired from the very first ex? I mean, i've got first strained lower back, then the abs.
Starting today. lets goo
Very beneficial.  Now it's up to numero uno to stick with the programme.
Is it wierd if i want to hit this guys chest with a spatula to see what sound that makes
New to your channel so this question might of been covered in previous videos but still I would like to know what is preferred workout on an empty stomach or certain length iF ttime after a meal ?
Should i do all the 6 exercises everyday for 22days or one exercise each day?
Should i do all the 6 exercises everyday for 22days or one exercise each day?
November 11th im starting i already did 1 set of this and planning to do at least 2 more i will do it for the 22days period and tell you guys the result i know im late but want to try it and change so let's do this!

Nigga looks hella old but fit
I'm feeling those X man crunshes in my lower back instead of abs am I doing something wrong guys? pls help
I died looking at the workout.
22 days to form a habit is a myth, it takes 6 months
Sir a have a question we are supposed to rest for a day or two after the workout so that muscle will get sufficient time to recover but if we will do this continuously for the days suggested i think it may not develop the core muscles it was just roaming in my mind i thought i will tell you whats better..  Thanks
He's so smooth
1st day, i'm suffering.  heels to the heavens 4x45" step through planks 2x45" xman crunch 2x45" thread the needle 2x45" alternating jackknifes 1x45" stationary bike not even 1x15"

How to burn fats in this area ?
Thank you!!!
From tomorrow 8nov 2017 I will start my abs workout wish me luck guys for the best💪💪💪
Nice exercise, thanks
You gotta wonder about the thousand people who "unliked" this video.
Perfect man body
22 days!? I can’t even do a 2 min ab workout :(.
Gotta have a cut off I'd be doing this at least an hour or two. So here it is if you kick or do improper form your out if you don't match you numbers from the first time your out for the 45 seconds. For the 12 reps no rest keep going untill you break form or can't.
Can i do ab workout even i am having belly fat?
Day 1 - Let's do this!
Can you explain what you mean by  "extinction"?
1:49 Heels to the Heavens 2:37 Step Through Planks 3:11 "X" Man Crunch 3:45 Alternating Thread the Needle 4:34 Alternating Jackknifes 5:18 Stationary Bike

Yo my hips snapping when doing heels to heavens
Anyone see the skeleton in the background  Fuck working out at that gym  It's hotel california  "you can check out but you can never leave
My favorite crunch is when a cookie crumbles in my mouth
The skeleton in the background is what he looks like before a protein shake
I'm a flabby ol 62 year old. But I'm gonna give this a bash 😁
Belly fat kam krne ke liye koi exercise ho to bataye

I have been looking for workouts I can add to my list, there are some out of this workout I cant use, ( spinal fusion L5s1, to L1 ) but there are a lot I can use, thanks ATHLEAN-X.
Just did the workout. My abs feels like they are going to explode. The burn is real🔥🔥
I think it’s patched
I can barely do the xman crunch xD :') so not in shape lol
The same ab workout for 22 days?
Thought you have to rest the core...... Right?
Put a shirt on
Gee I didn't know the Tetris guy was this ripped
This is really good. Great CONCISE explanation. Glad I clicked on it. Keep up the good work !
i will start this from today....can i expect pacs after 22 days because i dont have belly
These don't look like they're too hard on the back .. ?  look a little less impact but full exertion?
No pain ! No gain!!! No magic!!!!!!
Jeff.  I cannot for the life if do a crunch without someone holding my feet.  Which means I cant do the alternating jack knifes or the x man crunch.  Do you have any suggestions on excercises to help me with this?
Sounds good, will give this a go tonight. Cheers
Perfect. Thanks Geoff as this is what I'm looking for to compliment /supplement my Kettlebell training.    Can you please do a video on how to overcome persistent painfully stiff shoulders and lower back?  Many thanks.
its too hard man.... but i will try .....
there are two three exercises where u do plank...as a beginner its quite tough ...what is the alternative of plank for those excercise?
Can we loose belly fat by doing this....
Gonna do this 22 days counting naow!
Help me to i want to have tht 8 packs
But what do i have to eat
Nice info men Thanks
Just one question before ill start... what about the soreness and optional over training?
This is great man I feel ultra motivated to get my abs ripped. Thanks!
Just so I have this: Heels to heavens for 45 seconds (UNTIL FAILURE) Step thru plank for 45 seconds (UNTIL FAILURE) X-men Crunch 12 X Alternating thread the needle 10 X each side Alternating Jack Knife for 45 seconds (UNTIL FAILURE) Stationary bikes for 30 seconds
Once we've done 22 days of this do we stop or do we keep going? And if we keep going, when do we stop?
Good job
How long between exercises?
4th day and everything is sore
It's like training to failure for abs. Make it past the extinction, do it again until you do fail.
I can't even do the last two
I'm so dizzy today, because my mum punched me in the back of the head this morning 😣😲🤕
Day 12 seeing results almost there
Insane work out...

Thks
Can someone explain, how can I burn stubborn belly fat. It started developing since I'm 18 and now I'm 40.   Now I really wish to cut down my waistline fat; can someone help?

Day I
100% worked, ive been doing this once sometimes twice everyday as well as going the gym and doing alot of cardio and dieting and although i dont have a full on 6 pack i can start to see an outline of abs, this work out definatly works, day one i was rather tubby and by day 18 i started to see improvments and by day 22 im so happy i will do this for the next 22 days and hope by the end i will be even more happy :)

I have doubt sir,as you told in your another video that we should train abs as a muscle groups and between rest days So will it have any point training them without rest.And i  seventeen years old so I m eligible for this?Regards Aryan mehta from India
How much do you weigh and how tall are you?
Starting today!
Jeff cool because you don't have to train your abs for excessive amount of time to gain lean definition.
Ok so I'm gonna change my routine to this, I will update every week/try my best too if u guys want...I currently have a 4 pack and hoping to get it to a 6, for some reason the middle and bottom right and just don't wanna come through, they r semi visible upon tensing but not like the left side.
doesn't he look silly, vane and silly , oh well
I'm having a bit difficulty in keeping my breath in mids't of the activity. Is there any pattern of that? ?
You sir, have the best exercise videos I've ever seen on social media. I'm glad I FOLLOW YOU. Thx
I am going to try this Super Excited.. Thanks !!!
hey JEFF I have well developed six pack abs but I am still not able to do a full crunch on lying on a hard surface but I am able to do it on a smooth surface like a bed
I am beginner...and i have lower belly fat...can i also try.?...and what should i used to eat ..if i continue to do these exercises...and lower the belly fat....please reply...asap.... thanks
Do you take 10 seconds after every exercise you complete????? When you fail you start right in on the next exercise??
Very useful thanks.. i subbed
Day1: I lasted two rounds on the first 3 exercises but crashed in the first round on the remaining 3...
It's too tough for me even I take rest between exercises.
This video made me hungry, guess no time for workout
Superb....love this programme
Just started 1st day, really feeling good  contraction.

imma do a 22 day ab, shouders, biceps, triceps, forearms, chest, delts, back and traps (no legs) w/o rest cuz I just DON'T GIVE A FUUUUCK!
I'm 20% body fat now, what fat burner would you recommend that I use in order to drop to 10% or lower?
I am 15 years can i get six pack abs plz tell bro
I subscribed to the athlean-x app but i eat chocolates at night while watching jeff on utube. Is that bad? 😂
I wonder which is better - doing twice the reps in one session or doing one session in the morning and one session in the evening
this should be done in morning or evening
I have abs and I'm 14 and I want to them to show out a little more and I was wandering do u have any tips how to gain more muscle mass
What's up man, thanks man@ for sharing this ab challenge, my abs are starting to show through, it's really helped me, and I love challenges, I've been into fitness for a little bit but and were what I struggle with the most, I have the app, and I'm currently still doing the challenge, I can do 3 rounds of almost every exercise sub for one I only get two full 45 second rounds, but the Sean help me get a lot better and hopefully I'll be doing a lot more than three rounds of every exercise by the end of it, when I finish the challenge I'm going to upgrade the app and purchase a couple of the 90 day training programs I'm really interested in the 50 someday training program, someday I'd like to come to you guys gym and train with you, thanks again I love challenges,
I want to thank you so badly Jeff! Ive been a guy with pain killing addiction, and when i reached rehab i was at the bottem of my life. I wanted to begin to make something out of my self, be happy when i look in the mirror, and thats when i found the program Athleanx. I have followed Athleanx for about 3-4 months and i have my first goal so far, a six pack. Without this program i would've falled back to painkillers. Sorry for the weird post and language but i feel so much gratitude i fucking love you Jeff, you saved a guy from addiction!
if anyone had six packs after doing this
I don't know if I miss the part, but we do these exercises only one time and thats it or after the 6 exercices we reapeat it ? If yes how many sets ? Thanks :)
wish to meet you someday my idol
is roller exercise enough for abs workout ? and should i also increase protein in my regular diet to cut excess fat ?
My first time doing it and when I got to the thread the needle, it kicked my butt, lol. My balance in my core is bad I see now.
matthew mcconaugheys brother Jeff? :D

Awesome workout
I'm on day four. I do all of them 45 sec. 3 time each every morning.
Has this worked for anyone?
I will try this for 21 days.. thanks Jeff
Is da whole program day 01 of 22?
I will make a vid once I'm done
I love this workout; however I am having difficulty with the x man crunch. I can’t seems to be able to raise my torso up enough and likewise with the other exercises that require this. Also I seem to feel my back arching with the x man crunch. Also since starting I am experiencing pain in my right knee.  I know it must be something I am doing incorrectly. I really want to continue the 22 days, but do not want to injure myself.  Any suggestions? Or is there a link to ask these questions? Thanks 😊
The app is free and works! Saw results in a week and after 3 months I'm still not believing it. Although after the 22 days I plateaued and bought the app and it gets as hard as you want can shuffle and has a HUGE selection of workouts.   Good shit man, JP
I am from India does my body suits to do these exercises
Great moves
This man is awesome...
Hi!Great video! I noticed while u doin the "alter' Jackknifes" the left leg iis more straighten and the right leg is more folded at knee... wander what is the proper way of execute this one...ty.
Damn.. I slept watching  this video
Damn! Look at his back muscles in the needle workout!!
should i have a 10 sec rest between the exercises?
Anyone else have the problem that they stuck with the first exersise because the ab dont get tired of this exercise? I do 6 till 10 rounds with 10seconds rest between it without a problem and this kinda suck. After i go to the next exercise its getting better but in the first....i can do endless so i cant finish this programm in less than 1 hour... what can i do gents? Jeff? Anyone?
Jeff! I want to do this challenge but I also want to still be going to the gym working the other parts of my body.  Would you say to focus on JUST THIS challenge for 22 days? or continue to work out everything else at the same time. For instance, I did Chest and Triceps today, AND this work out. Is that good?
can a thin guy do this ??
boss thumbnail pictute
First video I ever saw of this channel.  My take away is that I like that he looks natural. Not roided up like most.

I have a little tummy around my abdomen. Should I reduce body fat level first before starting this?
Guys I'm 16 year old and I'm skinny.. Can I do weightlifting
Hey Jeff! I really enjoy your videos and I have a question. How can I apply the most higly effective excersise to burn fat? And what foods can I add (or subtract) to/from my diet? I would hope to hear back from you soon. Thank you
Im starting today
Wtf is that skeleton there for!??
Skinny like drawn face eww no ass eww too lean yuk !! Please eat
His abs look like brownies.      *Hard ones.*
This was amazing
I'm 16% bf can I follow abs workout?
Okay guys, I've been reading some of the comments on here and everybody's asking did you get a 6 pack from it. It depends on the person. If someone has very low fat content, it's more than likely you will or can after a few rounds of this. If you're a bit too big to have visible abs buts still very fit and toned everywhere else, it's either your body or your diet. You can work abs all day but if you don't have a decent diet, a little determination and some time you won't get them.   To summarize, working your abs does NOT burn the fat over them unless that's all you have which is unlikely due to how the human body works. A diet and routine exercise is what will do it for you. It takes but 15-30 minutes a day to do this, at least for me so there shouldn't be any excuse not to at least try it but don't get pissed if you don't have abs at the 22 day mark.
This extinction idea is a great idea
This has really help me at age 66 just need to stay with it for 90 days already see results in 2weeks.
Day 10

Anyone actually have trouble doing step through planks? I feel like im doing them wrong because my core does not feel fatigued my arms or  shoulders do after 2 rounds haha

Months later, I HAVE ABSSS !!
Day 2
The guy in the back took dieting to the next level
Thx so much
Best ab wk out yet. Day 1 dn. Thanks
I love you Jeff you are the speaker of truth
How many times a week should this be done?  Or should it be done every day?
Update: I did this the whole month of July. It was pretty tough, but all it really did was make my core a lot stronger. It may have been since i wasn't on a full diet, but ever since the ending of august, I've been working out and eating better. In result, my 6 pack is full visible now without flexing, so it's not only about the work outs, dieting and eating right plays a HUGE role in it!
Explaining to someone like me is useless. You gotta show me, damn it!!! YOU GOTTA SHOW ME!!!
Cant wait to try this
just a question to girls...how do you keep your chest from flexing??? XD iv caught my self doing it on accident, and my friend just looked at me weird lol
Explain ( dumb down ) your diet ..
alternating thread the needle, extinction level is 10 reps. If you can do it, great job, you just earned yourself ANOTHER 10 reps! some humor hidden there :D
MY 22 DAY RESULTS! day 1 (first link) day 22 (second link)  tinypic.com/view.php?pic=110vvr6&s=9#.WcFwiUFIDYU tinypic.com/view.php?pic=21ltl61&s=9#.WcFx10FIDYU Stuck with it from day 1. In addition I lifted for a hour and ran for 20 mins daily to create a 500 calorie deficit to burn off extra fat. I just got a DEXA Scan today to measure my body fat; I came in at 10.6% :D Also i made sure that my 22nd day ended on my Birthday. So happy birthday to me I hope my results were informative and motivational. Ask me questions if you'd like :)
I will try this for the 22 day period and let you know how I do.
Mates, please tell me, thats work if i am fat ?(no extra fat, + a good alimentation)  please help me
Im an offensive linemen in football (9th grade) and Im trying to work an ab workout each day that doesn't necessarily give me asthetic abs but more just a decent and strong core in order to have some explosiveness to compliment my leg training. Would this be a good workout for this purpose? (currently on day #3 and have not seen too much results which is to be expected for now.)
Dose this help, losing belly fat?
👌👍
Ha, I finished it 4 months ago
Step through planks just felt like I was stretching my legs tbh
Hey Jeff I am your keen follower.... Those workouts are proved to be extremely helpful for me And i have a request, i like to workout through your video And want u to upload more follow along video which will gives me more support and courage to follow u up to the end.... thanks
Great training program for abs, I do have a question for anyone who wishes to answer: I have lower back pain due to a bus crash in 2011, when I do some planks and lower abs exercises I'm a lot of pain, are there exercises to work my lower back muscles so the pain is minimised?
Jeff I just want to know where can I get those Sweats.
I died on x mans😓
Day 17. Abs are toned, rock solid. But I suggest after completing 22 days workout keep going further. These exercises hit every part of the abs. The overall results are fantastic.
im going to try this challenge
Puma Pants, Nike Kicks. I feel uncomfortable
Do I keep going after 22 days?
Juiced to the grill
Dam dude I almost couldn't sit up after this XD
could u plzzz add subtitles..
The needle one is IMPOSSIBLE, I immediately lose balance
This is good if you want to fuck up your back.
Les try dis sheett🙏🙎😳
Yo Jeff you totally got to sign up for American ninja warrior!
Great workout
My abs is very fat
No more than
This may be a stupid question but does he mean 22 days straight ? Or once a Week for 22 days?
hay can you make a live video
Why no rest while muscles always need a rest and recovery? I don't understand!
Hi Jeff , how often should I do abs workout without burning my abs muscles . Like daily or alternate days .
Jeff you should make a video like this for other muscle groups! obviously it wouldn't be training every day for those, but whatever frequency you think is best. like "24 day challenge for shoulders, over 12 weeks" (i.e if you can hit shoulders twice a week then do this circuit 24 times)

I have to say, I have been a little confused about all the articles talking about how you should not do crunches and sit-ups because of risk of lower back injury. Which of the gajillions of crunch variations should I also avoid? Don't any of these shown here count as crunch variations? More importantly, how can I analyze all the alternatives shown here and elsewhere, and detect which ones can be harmful?
6 more days! My strength has definitely improved and damn the thread the needle is challenging!
Day 1
Instructions not clear. My Titty stuck in the microwave.
My lower back hurts doing this on the ground, is it normal ? I feel like i'm forcing my back to be curved
Aiyoo G semma G mass.. Try pannitu solren paah
Could you tell me how many sets required?
Honestly, I'm sitting here with a bag of potato chips and diet coke & gonna start my work out tomorrow. I don't have a slightest clue, how I got here?
Hi.How much series I must do.
الله اكبر اشهد ان لا الله الا الله  الهم صلى و سلم على نبينا محمد
If I eat how long should I wait before I do abs? Or do I even have to wait?
Did workout not fully because it's just to hard. My top failed so instead I did at the end exercise for my lower abs after all these 6 exercises. 2nd Day
I fourteen I'm 6.3 and I way 230 half my body is muscle mass though but I don't have a six pack so I will try thank you for this workout
I will do this
Thank you for your time and help jeff. More workouts at home with just dumbbells please.
Great Abs Workout Video. A little bit Less Talking And More Demonstrating Would Be Better
dear sir. i could do the first exercise till 45 sec with 10 sec rest upto half n hour and got bored on first day only. anyone out der who faced the same problem? do we have so much stamina?, i dint knw dat before. lol. anyways, what should we do? continue for hours and hours first exercise only (heels to heaven)?
This definitely looks killer
Ty for ur information bro...
Wonderful Video
starting tomorrow😯
Im on😉😎
Ok, lets see if this shit actually works, I'll start these exercises during this coming week, and I will be posting videos after each workout, otherwise I'll ask for a refund
I though I should to let my abs muscles rest (as the others muscles) before working out again so the muscles can grow and recover :/
Good Video
So hard omg
I am 20 years old, Weight 65kgs, Hardly make 50 push ups in a session, I will be trying it , lets see 22 days mmmmm.
What about diet?
Ohhh this guy is tough
Fucking ouch
You're the man Jeff
Day 1: Here we go lets do this
I'm on day 2 and i have to say this is by far the hardest but best workout i've ever done for abs. its different then just normal crunches which makes it so much more enjoyable. Cant wait to see what day 22 holds.
Love that this takes away all the excuses! Thanks for the exercise
This guy is such a legend
I really am not very strong and so struggle to do some of these exercises completely, now on my 7th day I have gotten really good and I already see improvements.
Amazing video...all d best
I missed one day workout now wat should I do
Très bonne vidéo merci beaucoup
I'm starting this today
Ill be dedicated to do this everyday for 3 weeks. Ill start tommorow and will keep you guys updated about my abs
So if I do make it these 22 days. Do I rest for a day after the 22nd day or do I continue to do this work out
After reading so many comments of success i think i will start this ab workout too. I am already doing  two other workouts but those are for body fat after those i will use the rest of my strength on my abs wish me luck hopefully start tomorrow.
Question to semi-advanced ppl Did you do about 20-25 minutes from the start? Am at 2nd day and it took me 27 minutes and I would like to do some calculation :P  If so, how long does it takes in the finale?
When u hold up 21 in the thumbnail lul
Alternating jacknives ... what's with the left leg straight but right leg bending?
Day 1 - feeling sore and very hungry 😂
Does this work if you have a big ass gut? I just started eating clean and running, I have a big fucking gut and don't want to waste my time doing this if I'd have to lose all my belly fat first.
i love you now i have 8bak
this traning is the best
I am gonna try this workouts will I see the change in 22 days ?? if it works I will comment again
I have a question: Is there any rest before switching to a new exercise in this workout? From the video, Jeff makes it clear that you get a 10s rest between extinction sets, but do you also get a 10s rest after you reach extinction and before moving on to the next type of exercise? Hope someone on here can help.
where's your gym at?
Challenge accepted! Thanks Jeff.

Should I expect any back problems doing this?
I'm going to try this 22 days. I will tell you guys if this is legit and if 22 days is worth it.
Thanks for your effort to teach and give info about the fitness that much, i appreciate your videos so much and wish you keep it up until i get to my 50's :) But if you can give me  some detail about the building muscle by bodyweight workout, what i mean is that if it's possible to build up muscle without using equipments, just by push ups, pull ups,chin ups etc. and how to create our sets and tension on the workout. P.S I keep my diet very focused though.
Do you do one set a  day or? :P
Ouch my balls
Im only on day 3 but i can already feel my abs forming. Its actually an insane ab workout.

Idk really about this but im at the 6th day and now the exercises dont hit my abs anymore i could do them all day long, besides the jacknife and the alternating crunches. I dont think its worth to do that 22 days long when there are only two exercise actualy  kiking in.
what about nutrition ?
Day 8 22/8/17
Nicely compiled video, to the point.....I like!
His abs look like the gold robot from Star Wars
Great video, thanks for sharing.
i will try it  it seems difficult
i will try it  it seems difficult
thank a lot man, i wish you all success
For a starter is it good to get some support via hands for the 1st one...???
Will this burn fat as well?
I did it all for 22 days but my tummy still big but I got abs on my throat though...still a success..
I drink beer, sit back, and watch training videos and my abs just appear!
Is your stomach supposed to hurt the next day
Day 1 done 21 more to go
People who are trying this, what sort of diet are you having? I'm pretty sure that no matter how much I do this, if I don't have a proper diet, it won't work.
man this one may seem simple.but it's not...I hope it ll work..
Thank you for the program.  I set out today.  I find some of the moves a bit awkward, especially the step through plank with my right leg- I have a sore knee and it is hard to ben and extend through.  There is some awkward feeling with some other.  Maybe it is due to being 60.  Maybe its just that you make it look simple.  My question:  is it normal or acceptable to feel some motion difficulty and with time, muscles will strengthen and allow me to perform exercises efficiently & correctly?
wtf i did 5 sets heel to the heaven and then 3 step through planks but i couldn't do 1 set of x men crunch....good lord my back/shoulders didn't even want to go up T_T
thank you sir,sir as told shoulder injury hack for pull ups which is working awesome for me,so please can you give shoulder injury hack for push ups
great video ima try it.. thanks man
No rest. For 22 days. Just constant ab workouts 528 consecutive hours. Good luck.
I'm on day 7 and I'm seeing good results so far.  Not a fun workout.  But it's worth it 👍
Well, I'll give it a shot and see what happens.
Great... I got a mcdonalds ad...
What should I do to overcome strength ? I can't lift weights more than 20 pounds
Day 6. Note to self: do not drink water in between the various exercises. 16 days to go D: Shit. "Nothing worth having ever comes easy!" ... oh fuck, I made it through again... (Breathing properly is also becoming a problem during the exercises).
Those shoes are fly af jeff
I watched this and I'm tired. Gonna take some whey protein and WEIGHT for my GAINZ.
Day 4 18/8/17
It amazes me how doing thing the right way can make you do so many less reps or time frame I did this the wrong way and sure enough I did but doing it the right I would say I gave it my all had better results and sweat way harder almost change colour in the process I almost didn't make it in the second to last one at all now am on the ground can't get up without I feel my core paining the shit out of me like am trying to do another rep thanks again Jeff always remember follow Jeff practice of execution and not just how many reps
I'm girl and I'm definitely starting this today aug/18/17 I'll keep you guys posted
About 30 in and yeah this definitely gave my abs definition!  ...still waiting for that six pack though😂 (should probably cut out the cakes and nutella for that😂)
Sir can you mention the breath in and breath out moments during exercises.
Anyone know any substitutes for the jackknife. Can't do it at all
Those jack knifes are absolutely brutal.
How many times a day do I do this. Or do I do it once everyday?
How do you loose the anterior pouch , I mean the belly , it's been Long time , I tried all sorts of exercise and supplements (hydroxycut as example) but it keep coming back.. any advice ?
"if you're able to do 10 on each side, congratulations, you just earned yourself ten more on each side" lmao love it.
I did heels to heaven for 45 seconds X 2 and felt muscle pain on my arm after 3 days, I must do it incorrectly.
Can you create a Youtube for diastasis recti please ? Not for all your viewers but some guys also have this condition, and not only newly post partum, as some older mums need the help after decades of wondering why the crunches, rotations and planks have made things worse,. Need for a PT lead recovery workout where the pooch may be controlled, perhaps tamed and certainly not made worse - thanks
Very awsome thanks
its a very well thought out workout and i will start doing these for not only 22 days but hopefully as a daily workout
and what about the diet, one should follow?
Great video you inspired me to turn my flabs into abs
Can i do that twice a day?
Do i have to do this everyday?
Can u create a picture to explain this
I'm starting tomorrow and tell the results in 4 weeks
Is it bad to try to get a six pack when your 16 or what age should you be before you start training for a six pack
he looks like an actor from interstellar
Day 2     15/8/17
that will work even if i have a little belly fat ???
My lower back hurts while doing Step Through Planks and X Man Crunch. Is there any specific reason for this?
7 days in and can already see a clear difference!
Jeff makes this shit look easy.
Awesome video and you have a great body!
Anyway to messege you other than the comment section?
Day 1   14/8/17
Thanks a lot for your videos, there are very well explained and we can find all that we need! It would be nice to have some videos or advices directed to women's as our metabolism is not the same neither our goals :-) I would be interested in some exercises to lose some hips far as it is the only spot giving me a hard time!! Genetics maybe... Thanks a lot!!
Hug thanx man it works
I feel like shit and I don't see any results.  But! First week done.  Day 7. Heels to the heavens x3 (no rest - improved) Step through plank x3 (improved) "x" man crunch x2 (improved) Alternating thread the needle x1  Alternating jackknifes x1  Stationary bikes x4 (improved)
How long should a workout last a day?
22 days unitl labor Day!!!!!!
I love to join the programme
How dafaq do I know when I reach extinction? I get a bit tired after a few rounds but I can still go on if I try hard enough. I feel my abs burning so it's not like the workout is not working, but I don't really get to the point of not being able to do one more rep. Do I continue until I am no longer able to move or what? I really want to build some abs, I am skinny af.
Is it healthy to do it nonstop for 22 days?
Do you reckon he could just wear a shirt and then rip it off by flexing
(Guy in the back) me after a week of ab training.
My soul hurts
Outstanding!  So impressed by how fluent, articulate, yet seemingly conversational you are in your delivery; impossible to tell whether this is scripted or not - which is impressive, and I'm an actor, so I know a bit about that.  All these exercises look perfect for what I want to achieve.  I just turned sixty, and, although I've always been pretty fit, I had a total hip replacement four months ago, and in the three years leading up to that, I had progressively less mobility, and lost a lot of strength, and put on weight.  I've lost 20 lbs already and am rapidly gaining strength, and have given myself the goal of "abs after sixty", and your videos are the best resource I've found yet to support me in achieving that.  Thank you!
Hi bro I'm from India and recently I have started to make my body so now I'm doing hard for my abs so I watched your video ok I will try to do that work out and I will see what's the result.
Anyone else getting nothing but a sore neck from the jackknifes?
I have to do only this workout? I have to mix this with other excersises in the same day?
Fuck it... I'll give it a try. As in I'll replace my previous ab workout with this.  Also this helps me with a project called "the empty room" I'm working on for a video. Basically the empty room is a workout you can do with NO EQUIPMENT in an empty room.   So far I've got a few in the system, but I'm totally stealing these as well.
Started yesterday.
I am using app 6 pac  promise
You have any app for this
I can't even balance on a plank how am I supposed to do ten thread the needles
I hope this works for me. No excuses!
Day 1 I'm 5'2 93lbs and I'll give updates😀 #NODAYSOFF also do some extra workouts like sit ups and crunches to help tighten core😁😁
No Rest. Going for this.
do i need a supplements for abs?
I maybe stupid here? But how good for your back are some of these workouts? Like at 4:45 say? I shall be giving all a good go, I'm just wary of doing damage to my 'healthy' back, I respect it and don't want anymore dramas for myself, any input will be appreciated thank you.
👍
I am starting this at 1 A.M. on the 9th of August. That means I should have abs by the end of august.
I'm on day 5, I really appreciate this video, Thank You!
Hola no entiendo lo que dices porque haplo  español pero me gustan tus vídeos ,saludos de Rep.Dom
I love my abs so much I cover them with a couple layers of fat,u can never be too careful u know...
He look like plastic
You're awesome!
he looks like Ross from friends
i followed ur last video 25 of may.was nice work out.but you have some older videos.which one shoulde i do?
you said we've simplified everything n den u say it's gonna be tough nothing worth getting comes easy....antithesis here...
can this replace my biweekly/weekly abs workout ?
Do you still have a ten sec break even if you reach extinction?
please give us some bicep triceps workout home
Is there rest in between each exercise or I have to all 6 continously?
Just something handy for everyone following this daily- 1:50 Heels to the heavens 2:40 Step through planks 3:20 "X Man" Crunch 3:55 Alternating Thread The Needle 4:50 Alternating Jackknives 5:25 Stationary Bikes  Upvote so that more people can see this!
Every time I do these I feel like I'm not doing anything. I can hardly keep my upper back off the ground when I do the bicycle movement at the end.
I found no difficulty in doing this for the 6th day straight (maybe my core is strong; but i dont have visible abs; and my chest is weak)  I do these regularly : 4-5 rounds of Heels to heaven , 45 sec each round 3-4 rounds of Step through plank , 45 sec each round 3 rounds (first it seemed tough but improved with time) X men crunch , 12 reps each round 5-6 rounds (the most easy one among all of these; i can do 2-3 more rounds) Alternating thread the needle , 10 reps each side 1-2 (the most toughest one among the all; i found it very hard to do these) Alternating jackknife , 45 sec 2-3 (these were also morderate level) Alternating crunch , 30 sec     10 sec rest between rounds But overall its a great routine for abs ,, furthermore I added 60-70 pushups and 100 squats after these ;)
Is this every single day?
First day trying this and this workout kills trying to tighten my core so I can dunk on my defender as I'm only 5'11. I play varsity basketball and this still killed me 💪🏾💪🏾
I'm on my first day of exercise! I will update you every day what is happening.  Heels to the heavens x2  Step through planks x2  "x" man crunch x1  Alternating thread the needle x1  Alternating jackknifes x1 (hard) Stationary bikes x3
👍
This is honestly the most clever way of gaining views, everyday people come back to rewatch the video to remember he exercises he shows. Great Job Jeff, helping the people and still making money in a clean way.
First you should find out why ur left shoulder is up and second one down side of your body  And why are your left side ears and cheekbone look higher than right side  Ur left side clavicle bone is higher than right side  And why are uneven abs ?  In all over the world  The problem is common but no one couldn't find the correct point and couches to others about workout   I found the problem in human body which makes a symmetric structure to asymmetric structure  And I will publish it soon And its a new research and this will make a asymmetric face  even  And also it will make uneven shoulders blades to even, Everything will be symmetric
I can update if you want :). I started yesterday and today i am very stiff in my abs.
Great workout! Thanks Jake!
This is a great challenging an workout really on the grind. Love the puma pants and the Nike shoes btw
Hi, what you drink to get energy?
ATHELAN-X why i get pain in my leg when i make hells to heven, x- man cruch, and jacknives. Pain is like cramp on quadriceps or rectus femoris( taken those words from google coz dont know how they caled
so if I did this and ate healthy each day would that start showing signs or do I have to do more exercises towards the abs?
I'm confused, surely after 22 days you need rest days inbetween in order for your muscles to recover?
Hi sir. can you please help me. i have been working out for almost a year unconsistently. I am lean 26 y.old, weigh 55kgs., 5.5 ft height, asian, with muscles yet lean. I tried so many variations of abs workout but it did not work. i got flat stomach yet no abs, i can feel the muscles inside but did not develop very well. and abs are invisible. what should i do. i do a lot of foods i do drink weigh mass but i cant get bulky. please help. i want to be fitted strong looking average guy with 6 pack abs. (if possible)
When I do the x men crunches and the jackknifes, my back hurts BAD! What could I be doing wrong? I know that it has to do something with keeping my legs up in the air, maybe I just have a weak back or something??
If I'm using this exercise routine, but I'm also working out my abs in my martial arts training, should i do this every day?  Or should i take into consideration my other training.
ain't no amount of muscle gonna make this guy not look like metrosexual frankenstein.
I'm on day 3. This workout kills you
plzz can i knw what shoes ur wearing cause im shoe collector and i want to add these shoe into my collection plzzz let me knw thank you
Great routine, thanks for putting it out there.
Hey sir , i want to  make my chest wider what should I do ??
Challenge has been accepted , I'm on my 3rd day feeling sore from the last 2 days  . I just imagine how it will be like the next 19 days , have to push through .
Literally best thing ever. Not even a week in and seeing great results
Day 1 complete
5 day doing this exams going on still doing it💪💪 I'm an athlete and wanna become pro badminton player
Oh im going to try now i feel i will be fu¿ked up
I bet he shits more than once every other day...
lmao when you get a burger king ad
love the steroid content in this video
I'm 15 and a bit pudgy is there any video that can help me
Should I pace myself or do as many reps and rounds as possible for every single exercise?
I'm going to do this every morning before my yoga and/or run before work. Thanks for making a video that is very easy to follow and understand, but also looks really challenging. I'm excited to start!
I DNT HAVE THE ABILTY TO FLY. fuck.  Do one where I don't have to be superhuman .
Guy in the thumbnail looks like he is wearing one of those ridiculous Gallagher plastic muscle suits.  He is grotesque.  I can't imagine anyone wanting to look like that, let alone put in the effort and expense t.
Can I do this daily ?
I'm 12 and I already have a six pack  but I'm still gonna try this
Does Jeff know what a shirt is?
Thank you so much this is the best workout I have ever found for abs!
This made my stomach sore just thinking about it 😂
How long are you supposed to rest between each exercise?
i am doing sit ups and throwdown for every 1 hour. is it wrong?
im new. how do you set up a timer for all of that?
Can't get the second one right!!!!!!help please
I will keep posting reminders because I believe you can help many who suffer from this abnormality. Kindly do a video on diastasis-recti and exercises best suited for it. This abdominal problem has yet to be addressed by someone with your level of expertise. Thx in advance.
Just started today and just realized how weak my abs and core are even though I could plank 2minutes and do 60reps sit up in one go. I wonder how much improvement I'll see after this 22 days.
how many repetations?
Jeff you really look like my Neighbor except the muscles :-D hahaha
Do you need to eat protein after this workout?
I don't get it,please help.If i finish the 45 second exercise,i rest 10 sec. And do it again until i am done?
What happens after you "go extinct" meaning end lets say first or second excercise? Do you rest? How long? Or do you just go to next excercise?
day 70 . what do i get from this workout besides all the bitches sending me nudes 24/7 ?
Looks good will defo be giving that a try
I like the shoes! what shoes are those?
Can I do this if I'm skinny ???
What do you do if these exercises are really hurting your lower back
Jeff "THE REAL FITNESS MASTER... You have made me almost a fitness professional with such great exercises and tips.. could you let us know that we this Abs plan should be followed consecutively or there should be gaps of a day or a couple of days??
now what should I eat while I do this
Man I hate this shit when a dude who took a shit load of roids is going to tell you how to work out to be lean
Is it adviceable to do abs on daily basis? Or it should be done on alternate days?
I've got a question. Do these exercises can hurt the hip flexors? Because I'm interested in this workout, but don't want to get my flexors in worse shape than it is right now.
jeff your knowledge is unbelievable. i have learned lots. thanks.
very good
My first day doing this, been working out for a year. I included this, see what will happen with 21 days more to go. Hope I'll have ripped abs!
I thought you weren't supposed to train the same muscle group in consecutive days? I always read you need to give them a day of rest in between.
Im not sure, I must be doing something wrong or something. second day, my neck muscles hurt A LOT (almost sprain/strain level, had it once for a week or so so I know what im talking about). Im not even grasping my head in the last exercise, which btw  seems to be the easiest for me.
Why 1k dislikes
How many are you supposed to do a day, is it just 1 set a day?
For research purposes 1. 2:06 - 45 seconds Heels to the Heavens 2. 2:50 45 second Step through planks  3. 3:22 12 rep X-Man Crunch 4. 3:55 10 rep each side Alternating thread the needle 5. 4:51 45 seconds Alternating Jackknifes 6. 5:41 30 seconds Stationary Bikes  if succeed take 10 sec. and grind it again
Thats why I like Athleanx no excuses no bs
"What are you doing for the next 22 days?"  Me- "YOU PLEASE"
nice video....I have a flat belly but without a six pack...how soon can I see results with your daily ab workout..??
Nice video
another thing sir can this workout can burn belly fats? because i have a belly fats and its so big my BMI is around 29.4 which is Not good for my height of 5"2 at 160lbs
Jackknife is the death of me
Can you do this is you have belly fat? Please help,and my belly fat is not that much please help
i do 5 circuits of this. thanks jeff, abs are boring to work out for me, but now I like this idea.
aside from this what about diet? what i mean is your intake consumption on what you eat examples more vegetables than beef or meat r etc i really sorry im not good in english but thanks for this video sir im at 72 kgs and i want to go back in 58kgs im standing 5 feet 2 inch tall
Ive been doing this for a week and I'm already seeing results. If i were to go through the routine twice per day (once in morning and once in the afternoon) would i be overtraining my abs? Or would i see even better resulsts
I've watched lots of workout and weight training videos.  Yours are superior to everything else I've seen so far.  Thanks for the great content.
I am a big fan of your videos and knowledge. thanks a lot for keeping me motivated
22 days till school this is the plan till then
Sir how to increase height
So how long is this workout?
Burn baby burn!
Day 3. I'm sore that I can't even finish one set. Is this normal?
Day 1: was a horrible but this is how you know I'm not fit I will not stop.
day 1 done .. sweating 🙌
Should i do them after workout or at the beggining? Because im jump roping and im getting sweaty
Great set of exercises. Thanks for the extra motivation.
Does somebody know the count down app like movie 45sec
Can someone please tell me if this is an ab creator or ab maintainer? To my knowledge it takes more than a month to gain visible abs, if this actually works please tell me ASAP.
gonna start tomorrow
Day 1 done
I'm starting today
Am I the only one who thinks the X crunches are impossible, I cant raise my upper body as high the trainer does it. They feel so fucking impossible to do :'D
My heels are in the heaven and it won't back. Please help...
Who else got pain in the lower back while doing the first exercise?
How many sets do we do
I wanting  to start this today. BUT I HAVE A QUESTION if you do this  for 22 days then you are working your abs EVERYDAY. Your abs should be only worked every other day. Isn't that RIGHT ??
so is there supposed to be a rest between exercises or just 10s between everything?
I am on day 12, and I see a difference. Only ab workout that has worked for me. It's tough, but just follow everything he says. Also, do it EVERYDAY.
Can I do this in the morning and still do abs while in the gym after work at around 6pm? Won't it halter the recovery of my abdominal muscles? Thanks
once a day this is to be completed or we have to do multiple cycles of this daily?(ex. repeat 3 times)
roids everywhere.
Day 5 2 Heels 2 step throughs 2 X Man 1 Needle 1 Jackknife 3 Stat. Bike
just like rich piana ,gotta confuse the abs,to make them swole ? god damn it
My question would be - what if I'm super sore after the first day or two? Should I still keep going with it? Thanks!
Just started Day 1. Wish me luck! I'll be posting updates to let you know my progress.
When you do the feet to the heavens,  doesn't lowering your feet close to the floor focus on hip flexors
Just did my first day. Burning Man festival is in 30 days, so I want my abs on blast. I'm 36 with low body fat, and workout at least a couple days a week. I could barely get through this workout. Started sweating like crazy. Good stuff! Thanks ATHLEAN-X :)
Hi, I know that diet is very important for getting results, I am a 15 year old male. Does anyone have some tips or some do's and dont's?
Damn it, I burnt my chicken
sir can we do our other musle with this.
This is too fukhing hard
Is it wrong that I'm not feeling sore after the first day?
why total skeleton on there like a medical student?
u r d best trainer I have ever seen...sir..
wait so extinction goal means that I will redo the same workout until I can't reach the bar? Just making sure...
Day 3  3 Heels to the Heavens 2 Step through planks 2 sets of X Man crunches 1 set of thread the needle  1 set of Jackknifes (Bad hip) 2 sets of Stationary Bike       My abs are looking better already on day 3.
Are you suppose to only have 10 second breaks between each workout also?
On day 4. Couldnt go as hard yesterday not because of burning out but because of the pain/soreness. Will keep updating status intermittently.
dose it work
great workout!!!!
brilliant i love this
delicious body!
Nhìn bác giống bác Obama thế???
Do we do the workout twice a day?
Did the white guy in the background already do the 22 days?

22 years old, 6'0" tall, athletic build but nothing like his starting this now at day 1. Will update as time goes
Only day 3 and im soo sore
How much rest between the "new" moves? still 10 seconds or more?
Do you do all the exercises in one setting?  Im not processing what he means to "extinction"... any help would be appreciated.
Jesus Christ as a 13 year old kid this is extremely hard

I appreciate these no equipment workouts since I can't afford a gym membership or to buy extra equipment just to workout! Thanks!
should i suck my stomach in while doing the exercises?
I love all your workouts and videos . Amazing ..  I love trying all the exercises that you show and they always work for me .  Thanks ❤️😘
something i can do at home or anywhere outside :D Thanks mate
starting the 22 days now👍
Can we switch out some exercises?
can i do this twice a day ?
Video starts at 1:50
if you cant do even one of them, you do the full exercise in less than a split second, how amazing.
Is it me or does this guy always look so drained? He must be dieting 24/7??

sir tell us something about diet
#Atleanx do you think that okay if I do only one set of each exercise?
This guy don't have any fats in his body. All muscle. He's so define.
If i have a belly fat and i am not already lean, will this work for me too? Some people tell me that i could do 10000 days of abs workout and i'll have abs, but it just won't show because of the belly fat.
Is it better to do an workouts in night or day ?
Thanks man!
excelent!! short time and efective!!
i ll start
Isn't doing abs everyday bad ?
Disclaimer: I already have decent abs and I am in the 10-15% bf range Day 1: Heels to Heavens x 7 rounds Step Through Planks x 7 rounds X-Man Crunch x 9 rounds Alternating Thread the Needle x 4 rounds Alternating Jackknifes x 2 rounds ( I was dead ) Stationary Bikes x 4 rounds  I was hoping that someone could help me with this workout because I feel I am doing this wrong. This took me almost nearly 30 minutes and I am reading comments for guys doing this in 15 minutes. Also, heels to heavens seemed to be too easy. Help plz?
I just started again trying to build the habit of working out. I just did the first set, only did 3 reps and died. Going now for the rest.. ps do you know about a meal plan for burning fat without losing weight?
I feel so stupid cause I thought he worked out for 22 days straight 24 hours a day lol
How to reduce neck strain when I’m doing the jackknife
Very helpful. Thank you for the video.
Надо перевод
That moment when Jeffs fingers make 21 instead of 22 days
how much time rest after every exercise ?or I have to do them without rest?
Day 0, 22 more days to go
did this then straightaway pulled my tricep
Jeff.. I'm still on heels to the heaven. This is my 12648 set. Am I doing it right?
Can you do workout that don't put pressure on your ears I'm going to get ear surgery and I don't want to mess up my ears
I've been wondering. Does sweating have any impact on burning body fat? The gym I went to is so hot. There's minimum fan & aircond. Some dudes will turn them off, saying you'd gain more the more u sweat. so the me who already drenched was like "really??"
great channel. 🖒
Nice 👍🏼
Billion likes and thumbs up for you.
day 7 and already to two to three rounds per exercise. excited to see where I'll be on day 22
Anyone completed this that can confirm good results? I already have visible abs and single figure body fat %age, just wondering if this workout will make the abs even more evident or not..
white Obama
I was doing abs everyday for 1,5 years -.- But give me one year and you will hear about me ;)
The poor skeleton man died trying 😂 He took it literal, and burned it ALL OFF 😂
Instantly one of my most needed AX videos!
Love this workout, burns like hell nearing the end of extinction and targets all of the core.
The Jackknife is so hard for me. I feel like my back is about to snap when I get like half way.
My abs are sore as fuck...
Great workout. Last two exercises - I couldn't do shit :) Damn, hope this becomes possible to do somewhere down the 22 days:)
When I do the Heels to the Heavens, I get an ache on my back. My neck also hurts when I do the exercises for the upper body. How can I fix this?
Okay i'm a subs now
Guys whos scrolling down the comments to see if this works??????
make a mobile app so that we can follow these instructions while at the gym.
how old are you?
I wish at the end you did this consecutively so I could do it with you at the gym
anyone else say to themselves that they were going to do this but forgot , and just stumbled across this video and got remained
ima do this and report back
Do u think the Saitama (one punch man) workout plan, 100 pushups,100 sit-ups, 100 squat and 10 km everyday for 3 years will actually work?
if you do this exercise without rest you will get same physics like the guy on back 😂
how many Rounds for each exercise?
Day 1: after "thread the needle" it was down hill lol
more out of shape than I thought. that was tougher than it looked
this guy speaks alot
Day 1: *Does 4 sets of stairs to heaven no problem* thinks this is too easy  Day 2: * Struggles to get down on ground to do workout* Killer workout man!
22 dias estaré contigo!!!!  lol
How much time do you have to rest between the first extinction and the next exercise?
Im trying this out, if it works man Im your fan!!
Sir.
Thanks very much for your advice!
Jeff loving this as a new challenge! First 7 days challenge but into day 14 and getting it seeing great results! Challenged my bootcamp clients too they love it! Thank you for always adding new depth to training!!!
Dominos was the ad before this video lol
Exercises start at 1:54
thanks I will add this to my regiment and have an an workout to do even on my set off days.
Guy in the back is lean as hell
day 1 of this.. and it was pain.. understood that I'm still beginner.. but I won't quit!
Can someone explain to me the extinction method?
on day 1.. Again😳
Can someone tell if this works
nice... you can also check out body fitness and bodypro gym for starters and ladies in my channelcheck it out
how long should i rest between every set till the next?
Dang man, this is tough. But, it's a lot of fun!!!!
but if I workout everyday would it still make my muscle grow?
Nice physique But you should focus more on your shoulders
starting my journey today
I'm in Salt Lake City.  I get to the gym and start doing the "22 Day" Ab workout.  Guy next to me starts doing the same sets. "Athlean-X?"  "Yep."
XD
Based in the comments this routine seems to work. I'm giving it a go 😬
Jeff, I've been working out for a really long time and I've been doing these workouts but I can't seem to get my diet right enough to get abs. I can feel my abs when I touch them and people can punch my stomach and hurt their wrists and I won't even feel it. I have extreme core strength but my abs just don't show. They're covered by s layer of fat that everyone says I can get rid of with diet. I would really appreciate if you made a diet plan or recommend one if you know one. If I had a set food intake with the specific amounts I need it would help so much. Thanks tons in advance brother.
Everyday workout bro thank you👊
the bottom of my elbow on the bone is sore is that ok???
Any suggestions on the Diet and food control
is it just me or it all looks so hard to keep up with
Day 1 and I really struggled to do the exercises correctly. I'm hoping it gets easier.
Damn Jeff these are sick. got be burning. like a mother. thanks alot
holy fck the x men crunch are hard as foc
I did this many sets on each excise   1.10 sets  2.1 set 3.4 sets 4.11 sets  5.11 sets  6.10 sets
On My first day I was able to do 7 rounds of heels to heaven, and then 2 or 3 rounds of the other exercises (1 of x man crunch). It makes me wonder whether I was doing the heels to heaven right
Should i keep working out if my abs are sore?
Jeff.. I didn't think it was going to be that hard until I tried it and it kicked my ass haha
I have a problem in my 6th pack I have 8 packs but 6th pack is not as same as 5th packs and 6th pack is small what can I do  Jeff
A today was day 1 can't figure out the form to really feel the burn oh well 21 more days to figure it out
okay i am 6 days into this... 3 rounds 3 rounds 3 rounds 1 round 2 rounds 2 rounds my abs are killing me but they are starting to become existent, going to keep at it tho
this guys body is superb is"nt it ???
I'll try this 😁🤘🏻
July 4th, 2017 Starting today and will complete the 22 days! Here we go!
No rest for 22 days;seems hardcore
don't listen this guy he does a lot of steroids
Having trouble with the xmen, I could do regular situps but for some reason can't lift up upper body during that exercise
Day 1:  4 sets of the first one 3 sets of the 2'nd one 4 sets of the 3rd one  3 sets of the 4th one 1 sets of the 5th one 3 sets of the 6th one  Total workout time: 23 min 22 sec.
shouldn't we do it on alternate days ?
What happened to the rule of rest day? Seriously can anyone answer? I thought we shouldn't exercise tge same muscles two days in a row
Hello I'm a new subscriber and would like to now if these workouts would be good for women as well. Thank-you!!!
Does the legs have to be elevated at all time for the alternating jack knife?
cool i love it will try it and ill let you know
I feel scared doing these workouts
He's so fine 😍
Hey I just recently downloaded your 6 pack promise app and got the whole purchase and I had a few questions before I got to deep into it. Should I breath out every rep or hold in my breaths and just regularly breath and should I always keep my core tight or is it okay if it is not right all the time. Thanks for the inspiration man.
thanks for the 22 days of abs. I did now what's next???
Jeff, should I continue the excersice if im extremely sore??
I've got an excuse there... My room (the only space i've got for workout) is pretty full of stuff and the most space i've got is @2 meters (6 feet) on half a meter/a meter (1.5-3 feet) :P I have a pretty hard time working out at home too xD Altough i try to customize workouts for the group muscles so i get the ones that use as less space as possible
Jeff, I really need your help! Whenever I do heels to the heaven, my pelvis area produces a sound and it kinda hurts. What does this mean?
Today is the 5th day of this wrkout✌🏻
Hi Jeff I've been doing this for a while now and now I can do them all for 2 days straight without stopping. I'm starting to think sleeping only once a week isn't all that good for you, and I lost my job because i was training abs 24/7 less 8 hours. What should i do?
i get cramps in m ystomach cant finish
Jeff, I wanted to take time to write this to say thank you so much! I've had some weird shoulder pain that has been nagging me for a while. It's a sharp pain that affected my range of movement and prevented me from lifting. It hurt to even reach for my seatbelt. I've tried your tips on other videos for how to stretch the shoulder as well as your video for shoulder popping, but nothing seemed to help. I started doing this an workout challenge and after a few days, my shoulder feels brand new! I still haven't tried lifting because I don't want to hinder my recovery.  It must be something with the "threading the needle" movement that helped to strengthen and stabilize my shoulder better, but I plan on sticking with it and hopefully continuing to heal and recover completely. I just wanted to take the time to thank you...even if you may not see this. It's the least I can do. Keep up the great work. You're an inspiration and a help to so many.
I don't understand the people who dislike Youtube videos
This the ab workout I been looking for
What are the chances. I have 22 days until vacation  😂
So I've been doing this for about a week now. I see results on my stomach but for whatever reason I feel a lot more strain on my lower back then my abs and it stops me from doing more. Is that normal? Or do you think I should reposition myself somehow? Any suggestion would be appreciated
Can i do every day
2 weeks in and can't believe the difference. Form improving all the time as strength improves. kills but so worth it.
OK Jeff is shredded, but check out the white guy in the back!
Day 2 Done! 12x Heals to the heaven 3x plank smthing :p 3x x man smthing :p 1x needles smthing :p 1x Jack knives ;) 1x last exercise :'(
Are you 50 years old
I'm struggling with putting muscle on my upper legs. How bout a killer leg exercise?!
I'll take this challenge
will this cause hernias and what would warning signs look like vs mind playing tricks on you to make you want to stop a good workout?
Do you have tips for female endomorphs who want abs? Can you please break down instagram model pamela reif's diet and exercise, especially the cardio routine
💪👍👌👏
Did someone tried this workout? and if so can you share your results ?
does this work
bit to easy... or i do something wrong... need to much time for this...
. . . These are effin hard :( especially with a nerve damaged left rear delt :(
I m from INDIA ,2 fitness channel I hav sub 1)atleanx 2) guru mann guys must watch both of these guys have detailed knowledge

how many mints are enough for abs per day. ?????
100 Push-Ups 100 Sit-Ups 100 Squats and a 10KM Run
I love this channel so much, helping me leaps and bounds, thanks bro
Brilliant work as usual Jeff currently doing my active iq level 2 and 3 and love your videos
fucking love it
How much rest between each exercise ?
I will start this challenge today! I will keep updates on the results everyday!
Can someone explain me the system/the rules please? I dont really understand it
Looks great! You can use a great simple and easy app for interval timer sets (for android phone): https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=yoavsabag.intervalsetstimer
Really love this channel but there are so many videos. Does anyone have a recommendation for a specific set of videos that have given them good results?
Subbed, this workout fucked my abs in a pleasant way
Going to subscribe and do this later..... not an excuse but I have a PT and she's built like Floyd Mayweather Jr. with boobs....    I worked out with her until I puked several times and couldn't find my way from the gym to the train station afterwards.....   I was on the verge of hallucinations lol...  I don't want to be burnt out going in there.  And my one pro tip for anyone young.....  NEVER SMOKE TOBACCO.
Thank you for this workout tip. could not do any of them for even 30 seconds lol. let's see if i can do it after 22 days :)
EXCELLENT.......!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! HATS OFF SIR...............!!!!!!
All my friends wanted to SEE me shredder after the summer vacation, misson accepted
No rest? How can your muchels grow?
I followed this workout for the past few weeks. Eating clean and being consistent- hello abs! Thank you!
The best fitness channel on fucking Youtube...
nice
Okay...26/06/2017 I am going o do this for 22 days, i will keep posting my progress every five days wish me luck!
do you do the same amount of sets/reps everyday or do you make it harder each time i dont get it
When i do this things my back hurts WHY?? HELP
I pretty overweight and just make these work for me soon ill have the form and strength down to do them correctly. 4 months ago i was 278. today i am 235!! Thank you Jeff!!
Thanks alot for this one! Awesome new excerses to do
Thank you so much for posting all these videos, you are such an awesome dude.  As a tall and skinny kid just starting to workout for the first time in his life these mean the world to me
i failed after 1st weekbecauseof myjob so im gonna try again
Is it 22 days in a row? I've heard that is good to rest when you do abs, like any other muscle. Any comments on that please?
I quit watching these videos dude supposed to be some kind of workout Geniuses but he's all flabby all soft-looking just don't get it
he looks like matthew mcconaughey on steroids
killer routine.  love it.  bout kills me everytime...nothing good comes easy, I approve
can you build and maintain a.good look without meat, eggs and diary?
working out everyday is bad?
Puma/ Nike sponsors?
oh NVM
started today. Mr. Jeff, If you don't mind, I would update this thread everyday since I know I, would came back day after day, those excercise are not on my head yet.  Day 1 Excercise 1, Can't make it through, 33 Secs and I totally fail Excercise 2, 45 sec 1 Rep, Remaining excercise, I totally raped them all.  I'll update this section as my ledger, every morning, after I finished the sets.  Cheers, not for the Beer, Cheers with the shakes.
You're awesome man 💪🏽
gonna give this a shot
1) Heels to heavens (45sec): 1:55 2) Step through planks (45sec) 2:43 3) X man crunch (12reps) 3:18 4) Alternating thread the needle (10 reps each side) 3:52 5) Alternating jackknifes (45sec) 4:46 6) Stationary bikes (30sec) 5:30
How many sets do we do per day
heel to the heavens & x man crunch, it pains in my back when i do those... why??
Just to clarify- the time based extinctions are whether we can keep going for that duration? so no stopping, but also no need to speed through the exercise?
Hi Jeff. when im doing most stomach exercises,  I find that after a short time my lower back starts to hurt, i guess you could. Am I probably doing the exercises wrong or I just need to work more on my back? :)
Hope this works😁
do you get a 10 second rest if you fail?
Jeff, Im on day 15 and my abs are showing! Ive had a few rough times, but Im going strong.
Just did say one :)
Day 3 complete combined with hiit and I can already see my abs more clearly, though I could slightly see them before
im not fat or too skinny and i did this for 22 days straight still looks the same even had form and everything right .
I can't do the alternating jack knifes could I replace it?
Anyone tried this for 22 days and saw results?
day 25
Would this lead to an injury? In order for the muscles to recover and grow, I thought you would at least require a few days in-between each workout.
And after these 22 days what should i do? Continue with this routine everyday or change it with something else?
Do u have an app?
starting it today hope it works. actually tomorrow its 10pm.
I love this ab workout. Just found this. Just started it!!
its gud and without gym :p
So good
Wonder if I can even get those 'Athlean-ABS'
7 minute abs workout or this?  which do I follow?
you told about reps but what about the sets for every exercise? just one set?
What is the rest period between each workout please
this exercise can lose belly fat?
everytime i do an ab exercise where im lying on my back, my lower back bones pop out and have all the pressure on them and it really hurts, i still try to do the exercises but i give up at some point in the middle. please help
so i finished day one and i dont have abs wtf
Check out my quick abs tutorial on my channel! Would love some feedback! Thank you
I looked at the title and im "like pff u an idiot?"
Day 1 (June 24th 2017)
please make a video on diet too which will affect on abs workout or to be get shredded thank you
Jeff your real motivation machine! im super tired of work today and i gonna do this workout! Your the BEST!!!
guys this really worked!!! im so happy with the results if you really want them abs to pop out try this routine !!!
What do you think of gravity boots (hanging upside down) and doing sit ups with them?
I am gonna start this today. gonna keep u guys posted
i follow this routine let's see what happens
how long do we rest between each workout?
I love this man
I love the comment section. Lol
Thank me later...  Heels To The Heavens = 45secs Step Through Planks = 45secs "X" Man Crunch = 12reps Alternating Thread The Needle =10reps (each side) Alternating Jackknives = 45secs Stationary Bikes = 30secs
This is awesome... I am the one to bypass most exercise guru's crap... but you really know your stuff! I'm motivated now, I will start this program today. THANKS good work
Remember it will not work if you're not dieting well
i think bulking and cutting is good for bigger chest muscles. when you bulk and you use the right supplements like bcaas for muscles retention to shred, you can keep that big chest and look good with a lean body. i tired working out and my chest muscles did not get bigger but when i bulked it worked for me.
Every year when summer is coming videos with abs double their views
OM -1 OM
day 24
I love your videos! I did this today at the gym, got through about 3-4 sets of each exercise I got some work to do!
Hey, Can you please make a body weight workout routine for a month?  It will be a great help.
How old is this speaker??
you are sterling archer
I am going to try it
i can't do crunches help?!😂
i HAVE A QUESTION, I HAVE ALWAYS HEARD THAT YOUR NOT SUPPOSED TO TRAIN YOUR ABS EVERYDAY, THAT YOU HAVE TO REST THEM JUST LIKE YOU WOULDN'T TRAINING CHEST OR SHOULDERS EVERYDAY,  THEY NEED TIME TO REPAIR AND RECOVER.   SO ARE THE AB MUSCLES DIFFERENT? DO THEY NOT NEED REST OR RECOVERY DAYS?
I started doing this workout a week ago and no i really can see a big difference. A week ago i was thinking that i do great core workout, but man... you prove me wrong. This extendable workout is crazy and it takes no more than 15 minutes for now! Thanks for sharing your knowledge and keep up the great work Jeff!
22 days later
Day 3!!!
day one. just finished workout. I already have visible abs but I want to get rid of the stubborn lower belly fat. I will keep u posted
yes do more of them like four arm's and triceps since I have a frozen shoulder Thank you
is skipping ropes good for fat lose?
I went all out on the first 3 days but now my abs are soooo sore that I can't do nearly many sets
22 days??? big BS
jeff do you use stanozolol for cuting cycle, I saw your mass definition is so hard, I think you use stanozolol first for long ago and now you stop it and just continou your routine diet to keep your lean mass, right ?
Started workout today :) interesting 21 days are in front of me. ;)
Second day and is killing me but I won't quit
Did anyone stay consistent with this and got abs?
thanks a lot you are my favorite fitness trainer on youtube☺
You are The Best x
How many sets of this should be done?
1. heels to heaven 45 seconds  2. step through plank 45 seconds  3. x man crunch 12 reps  4. alternating thread the needle 10 reps  5. alternating jack knife 45 seconds  6. stationary bike 30 seconds
can you make a workout for legs and glutes without any weights would REALLY help me
Done!
This ab routine is fucking killer. I've done plenty of them before and this one really hits it, better than anything I've done before. I'm fucking sore on my RIBS on the upper part of my torso! (as well as the rest of my abdominals) Thanks Jeff, you are the best.
ok thanks
"mission 22d" launched....... I'll leave e feedback after 22 day in this comment box...let's see what happen..... 😊😊
thz guy is ripped as hell...he is 42 btw...damnn
who finished thumbs up 💪
day 23
So do you just repeat each of the movements everyday? I'm still a bit confused, I want to do this challenge.
After watching full video, the only thing which i can't follow is #NoRest😓
how many days should you rest your body? and what muscles do you work each day? I need a good routine  just did your 22 day ab workout and my abs are on fire! I am going too challenge myself to do these every day! Thanks Jeff you are so helpful ! I also have been focusing on time under tension and it works! I can tell the difference already! I watch all your videos they are so helpful I am a hard gainer! I weigh 135 soaking wet like Jesse  5' 8 little guy ! I dont want to be little my whole life!
Did almost 3 complete sets of "heels-to-the-heavens" before I reached extinction (first exercise).
Very good workout for abs
Day 22 done, if you say that you don't have time save that crap for yourself   The one commodity that is most valuable on this earth is time. How many seconds, how many minutes, do we waste everyday doing things that are  nowhere near the goals and aspirations and passions that we have inside. How many times you go through the course of the day and realize, did i do anything i set out  to do today? write down these goals each and every day no matter if there is two goals a day, if you can accomplish those then you're doing more than just making it through the day, your   .are living and achieving your dreams.
wow great video really helps!
hey guys im on day 6 and with everyday i can do more and more and my training becomes more consistent.But im legit scared that nothing's going to happen in the end.I dont have abs and i have a belly and i really hope that the belly will be gone and i will look more fit.If anyone can share soomething with me on the subject would be nice
thanks it was really helpful and yeah thx for the help
day 1: 3:00 day 2: 4:20 day 3: 4:40 day 4: 4:51 day 5: 5:20  keep on working guys !   i keep getting better in every day, you can do it
Do a video on American Ninja Warrior training!
Thats something real hard... 😍
very good wày to get a six pack
how can I burn fat off of love handles and the lower abs? also what are some workouts simple daily routines that people can do on their own to burn fat?
So I have done this for about 22 days and my core strength has improved greatly. this works get athlean guys
Jeff should i train my abs if they're sore from the other day ?
can i drink water in between ??
I accept the challenge
who got a six pack from this
I feel like the man in the back after this training
He is doing the X-man crunches so smooth, wow.
would u say to do this or use the six pack promise app
Fuckkkkkkkk this is hard
So if you can't make t through an exercise, will you take a 10seconds break before your next exercise; also will we only be doing 1 round?
Dunno if I missed it but after reaching extinction is it straight into the next exercise or 10/20/30 second rest etc?
those jackknifes are brutal
Does the plank murder any one else?
Am I the only one who has problems doing the step-through planks? My leg just doesn't 'step-through': it either goes towards the ground or hits the other leg
effective tutorial,  i will definitely put to use.... thanks man
Wooow, your body looks so nice! Do you workout?
When you fail is there rest between exercises or do you just move straight on?
Loved these exercises, it will be fun to do this :)
day 21 i can't believe my eyes when I'm looking at my abs. Tommorow is the last day and I will do compare between the starting point to the end
Wait, is one to do this every day? Pretty sure you're not supposed to train muscle groups back - to - back as it limits actual gains. The movements seem great, though.
Really enjoy your videos Jeff. Great insight and information. You really put the exercises in myological perspective.
very good ....thank you very much
What's consider one rep for alternating thread the needle?
day 3: 4:40
Hey Athlean-x, I've been watching your videos and  Jeff is really a few of those guys that really know what he's doing, keep it up and yeah I was thinking about asking you guys to do a video on Conor Mcgregor's body and power, I mean the guy is not big not bulky, but seriously packed a lot of power in him and his body which is shaped perfectly and beautifully, how do you get a body like that?, I know his workout includes movement training, muscle ups but there's something that is missing there that I don't know, help me up, stay blessed, stay healthy, stay fit, successful and happy, God bless, Peace be unto you and your family, thank you...
just do plank everyday.
Anybody start this with a gut? Results there?
can you do a video where you do that with a clear clock, or counting? because i don't know how to calcualte 45 seconds of exersice and 10 of rest in these cases! and which is the exercise to do nexr. thanks!
Hey Jeff, awesome work still, after all those videos you still manage to teach something different ;) Good job!! You look your best the whole time, too, nice work!! I was wondering; what are your three compound exercises? Now and then, I like to change up my training and suddenly put in some compound, full-body workout to wake every fibre in me.. feels great.  I know you've posted about full-body and upper-lower split workouts before, just wanted to know your favorite compounds. Grtz from Belgium ;-)
Left Comment For To Save/Remember Video
I accept the challenge!
can this be done after a workout? like first get done with chest, arms, back etc etc and then finish with this? or is this to be done completely seperate?
Jeff how bout some food videos like what to eat and what not to eat? Please?
the Jack knife is the hardest one for me
Athlean, aren't crunch exercises bad for the spine though? I've been trying to stay away from them from the research that I've seen, but maybe you can shed some light on it for me?
Day 1:  well, that is bloody tough Total workout time 3:00  Day 2: feeling good Total workout time 4:20
two questions: 1. Is it always 10 secs rest between the same exercise? if i do the heels to the heaven 45 secs and complete the first set, then i get 10 secs rest and then again Heels to the heaven? does this count for every exercise? 2.Is the workout goal, completing every exercise one after then other?. or should i stop when i Cant anymore?
does this work when having 18% bodyfat? i just want those fucking love handles gone and a bit of my lower bellyfat before i go on my vacation. i have 25 days
You, Sir, are one hell of a trainer.!
day 20, 2 more days!  total workout time 13:35
I wanted to know if we should do this abs workout after or before jogging or a short run
do we just do one set?
Don't think anyone made a list with the timestamp for when Jeff does the exercises. Here's for everyone just starting with these exercises (like me).  1. Heels to the heaven (45 secs) 1:55 2. Step through plank (45 secs) 2:44 3. X-man crunch (12 reps) 3:20 4. Alternating thread the needle (10 reps each side) 3:53 5. Alternating Jack knives (45 secs) 4:48 6. Stationary Bikes (30 secs) 5:30
don't think I've done any ab workout like this holy crap
day 1 completed. it was tough, although i could not reach the sixth
Challenge finished! Can I get a day off? :)
Both my heels preferred to stay on earth. Am i doing it wrong??
would be great if this programs made it to the ab app.
I can't do these exercises because my lower back curves so much.. I've been doing lower back exercises for strength but it doesn't seem to be helping. Any tips from anyone?
can we please make this guy a millionaire? he needs to be on tv, have his own fitness show, maybe a fucking channel on tv. id get tv just to watch football and Jeff cav
Jeff the only guy that can make cross dressing brands look crispy. puma track pants with Nike shoes... 🔥🔥
Can you show a video when you connect a rope to a cable and pulled it down in an angle to do the obliques.
What's the model of Nike that you are wearing ?
It hurts my low back when I do anything lying on my back.... I think it might be my tail bone its those two little bones at the bottom of your back just outside your spine anyway to reduce the pain?
Thanks great tips-bless ya,peace
This looks completely doable...finally, an ab workout that doesn't include 1000 crunches! I can't wait to try this, thank you!!!
day 19 abs are fucking rock clear shape, toned AF I'm hyped!!
my body weight is 63  and age 15  so what exercise is best for me
Day 22. Amazing feeling! I have a new core now, thats for sure. Did yesterday the 7 Minute Ab Workout (6 PACK PROMISE!) just for benchmarking and i did it very easily. Thank YOU Jeff!!!!!!!!   ...... to be continued...
what is  you eating  any protein  powder
This is DOOOOPE!!!! tHank you!
I did the first exercise like 20 times, any advice to make it harder
Great ab workout
you give good advice/exercises I like how you don't bullshit, NO amount of exercise will give you desirable results if you don't mind what you put in your body
Hey Jeff Im on day 20 right now and I was doing great but the last few days I've been feeling back pain which is limiting me , is it cause of the workout or my form or ?? Help
I`m stopping at 44 seconds on purpose so i wont have to do another level
Can A teen also do this exercise??
I hd cataract operation... which type of exercises  I should avoid
When I go extinct on one exercise, how long should my break be until the exercise? Thanks!
I'd love to lift with this dude. 😂😂
Great videos. But I really need to know of a good diet. Do you have video for that or maybe a list you can reply with to this comment? Thanks again.
does this help for loosing belly fat?
day 18 I have been taking pictures of my abs since day 1
Day 21 done! Only one day to go to complete the challenge, but this is now become a morning routine.
Man this guy makes like $500k for his YouTube channel...sick!!!
So much positivity on this mans videos...its nice
hi Jeff! at my fourth day now. I find stationary bike especially challenging to me. Couldn't keep my shoulders off the ground and very hard to make forward movement. Any suggestions here? or is there another move to replace it?
Man! Ur face and body don't fuckin match😂
Man! Ur face and body don't fuckin match😂
Hey Jeff, following problem. I did this workout 3 times in a row. Then I didn't have any time for 2 days. Now I did it again, and i needed 10 minutes just the first exercise. before I needed 15 to 20 minutes for the whole thing. I'm still doing the exercises properly. should I just continue with a really long workout or adjust it for my level? If I should adjust it. How can I make it harder?
The only thing I do not like is the time-limit extinction. I don't have a timer.
Great workout.
Today is the 14th of June . On the 19th I'll start it . See you then
Does this work
them jack knives been killin me for 2 weeks now
That skeleton need some protein..
im going to try this I want my six pack back
Do people still do traditional crunches?
day 17
Day one
Day 20 done! Lets go!!
is it alright if im doing all exercise until I cant properly do another rep without really following the time or number recommended?
what shoes does he have on?
Is it normal to go on for  20+min every exercise after doing this for about a week or two? Because he’s said before ab exercises should be short like 7 minutes. This is with an average of: 5 rounds heels 3/4 rounds step through  4/5 rounds xmen crunch 4 rounds thread the needle 2 rounds jack knife Unable to do stationary bikes anymore😂
The guy on the thumbnail has no belly button...
day 1 abs on fire good ab workout
day 16 guys if you didn't start because you want to see people results first before starting such a hard workout. Yes, you do see results  if you had abs already you probably gonna get'em bigger and more toned  if you don't have abs I guess you probably gonna get ride of that belly and achieve harder cores.
Me and my friend is going to try it . I hope for big results 🙏
Love how this workout has no excuses! Definitely trying this!
this thing kicked my ass
As a part time fitness instructor and full time musician, I love your videos. Gives me ideas to teach groups or various levels and pushes my own level. Cheers Mate
Is the 22 day program everyday straight with no day rest for the abs?
👍👍💪💪
I love this workout. I'm on day 18. For those about to try it, I strongly recommend you get a timer app. I was too relaxed to start with the rests, but now I'm more disciplined. Here's my best so far for each exercise:  1. Heels to the heavens: Usually I make it into the 3rd set before failure. 2. Step through plank: Usually 2nd set i fail, sometimes 3rd. 3. X-man crunch: this one burns. I managed 12 + 12 + 6 today. My best so far. 4. Alternating thread the needle: 10 of each + 5 of each my best so far. 5. Alternating jackknife: I've never managed more than 20 seconds of this. It kills me. How does everyone else find it? 6. Stationary bikes: this one I find pretty easy. Makes me think I'm doing it wrong... but I don't know what. I usually do around 6-9 sets and then generally get bored and stop. So I'm not really getting properly to extinction on this one.
BEST AB WORKOUT EVER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THANK YOU! #NOEXCUSES
very good nature body wp bro
day 15 my obliques are ripped broo!!!  I already had abs so they are just more ripped and bigger than before thanks!!
ABs on fire but still in the game... 18th day down!!
thanks jeffy
I'm fat guy and just start my journey so I will try it for fun 😁 it's not easy but it's worth
I have an umbilical hernia. As a result, I stopped working out my abs and I have a bit of a beer belly going. I want to get back in shape, but what exercises should I consider given the hernia? Much appreciated in advance!
how are those red nike shoes called?
not gonna lie man, just came across this video and figured what the hell. just got back from my 2miler and then did this and let me say F***! I mean i knew my ab strength was minimal to say the least but this proved how much work i need to do. I am now going to incorporate this to my work out, so thanks!
Besides the 10 sec rest between the sets, should we rest when changing exercises?
Day 2: feeling alittle better😂still hurts a lot doing the exercises
Thank you
I CAN FEEL HIS ABS!
How many years has this guy been training? His body dude
Bruh he look like a 43 year old personal trainer that tried coaching the Philadelphia Eagles
Jeff, type of nigga to wear Puma pants while wearing Nike shoes
I'll try my best 😃
just by watching jeff videos make my abs pumped up :/
day 14
I want to workout in that gym with JEFF!
Hello me in 22 days , nice abs bro
تمارين فعالة جربتها💪👍
17th day. No rest day, no excuses!
on day 8 and man im lovin it
what's the idea behind this? I couldn't do as much on the second day, and the third day was just pathetic. Clearly 24 H is not enough recovery time for my abs when worked until exhaustion everyday.
i am on day 6..
I admit... I cheated.  Did not go to extinction on 4 routines.  But it did take me 1 hour and 10 minutes to do 70 sets.   I"m 3 months off turning 60 so quite proud of myself and appreciated the workout combination.
This one is insane! Did 2 sets of the first and then 1 set of the rest and hardly finished the last 2 exercises... Couldnt even finish the Jackknife! I am not even a beginner... Sweet :) going to try this challenge!
I haven't worked out abs before is it bad that I can't do more than 7 reps and less than 10 sec?
I've read about how much time it takes to develop a habit and all of them average at 60 days (2 months)
im 14 and i play 5 different sports competitivly . this really helped
Great Videos jeff! is there any Light Version for the last excersize? i really feel the muscelgroup which is targeted, but I cannot fully contract it due to a lagg of strength, i guess. sry for my english and thanks for ur help :)
Day 16...DONE!!!!!!!!!!!!
I just done this, didn't make it once but my abs are on fire.
Does this work if you start at extinction level?
What's up stanley!!
😔 you make this look so easy
i have my lower abs but i don't have my upper. suggestions?
Do you need to do all exercises resting 10 sec. and repeating until you cannot or only the first?
He's soo descriptive unlike most
Great workout
Day 15... done!!!!!!!
I'm gonna try this ab workout for 22 days straight and record my progress and post it here on YouTube. I wanna see how well it works and what change it does to my body. I know diet is just as important as fitness so I'll make sure that I keep that in mind as well. Wish me luck guys.
day 13  total workout time: 12:45
Hey Jeff can we try this of we have anterior pelvic tilt.
and u are a Batman
Day 7: still cannot do stationary bike
do you have to be kind of skinny to able to get abs , im not fat or slinny im like in the middle , would it still work for me ?
Here I start day 1 lets do this!

Day 2 and dying.
Will Start From Today
This is way harder than it looks. But I'm sticking with. Thanks bro, best workout I've tried
thats how i look like if i didnt have any protective fat on my stomach.
I love this one!
How many circuits?
Does somebody know how you can target upper obliques (to fill in the waist instead of just making the hips look wider)? Is there an exercise specifically for upper obliques?
guy behind him is on hard cord dieting
this guy is nothing short of brilliant .

is this fully body workout sir?
thanks jeff
I started this workout schedule and it has been 11 days but there is no result. also, all this exercise increased my diet and I've started to get a tummy. is there some special diet or something?
Has anyone done this and actually worked with them?
i need help here im confused, so these means that need to work out the abs for 22 days straight? is it a good idea?  how about the recovery?
+ATHLEAN-X Nice video! Will you be making more 22 day videos but for different areas of the body? I.e arms, chest etc..?
hello, wanna start working my whole body. want a uniform look not the johnny bravo look where the upper part of the body is bigger than the lower part. what do you recommend i do?
I honestly love you for your amazing videos !  Imma do that challenge. I know I will fall flat on my face after half a minute or so, but it's not about how many times you fall, it's  about if you get right back up again !
Awesome
amazing workout thanks alot .... did it but feeling sore :) could  restart after 72 hours
Does anyone  know an alternate to the second exercise? I have a hard time with it.
Cooles Video!
sore muscles  :-[
this is day 3 these workouts online is enough to whip you back into shape. I wanna know now how the real deal is.
do i need to do that everyday for 22 day
... and, on the 13th day, i`ve lost my belly...
Day 13... !! Lets go guys!!
day 11
Yess I'm going to do this
I'm going to do it
I'm on day four and i feel like I'm getting worse!
I have been doing these exercises for 7 days now. I'm always giving my all and steadily increasing to multiple run-throughs. I manage every exercise at least 4 times now but the Alternating Thread the Needle is arghh. Today I managed 3 rounds (1 round takes ~ 1:45 min and with 10s pause...ffs my shoulders burn). After workout is done, which by the way takes like 30mins, there is always a puddle of sweat to mop. My diet works, so does this workout for the abs, they got pretty tight. I have 3 weeks of diet left until my six-packs is revealed.
Love this channel!!! But remember working out doesn't make sense without good nutrition! Check out The Nutrition Mission!!!
bro this shit kinda hard lol I just be swimming n eating fuckin chicken n broccoli all day hopefully it hook me up with flat stomach lmao
This is a crazy good ab workout omg
hi from Puerto Rico.  i need help for make good diet. How you can help me with thai?
Which is the best routine .... 1. First doing gym then  running OR 2. First we do Running then gym (Explain with scientifically)  and why can't we do first gym then running........Plz give a suggestion
12th day down!!!
HOLY FUCK, first time doing that specific workout, couldn't even get a full way through the last one even one, almost immediately hit extinction
day 10 NO GAIN NO PAIN, FEEL DAM BURNT SON. MY ABS ARE MELTED FEELS LIKE YOU GOT A VACCUM ON YOUR ABS
if you don't meet extinction how long between different exercises?
You are so spot on!  This is a killer exercise.  Great vid!
Easyyyyyyyy
1. Heels to the heaven (45 secs) 1:56 2. Step through plank (45 secs) 2:45 3. X-man crunch (12 reps) 3:20 4. Alternating thread the needle (10 reps each side) 3:53 5. Alternating Jack knives (45 secs) 4:48 6. Stationary Bikes (30 secs) 5:30
so do you do this everyday for 22 days are there any rest days?
Day 2. DONE
I just tried this so I'm going to give you the number to my psychiatrist because I'm convinced youre a psycho jeff.
Well first I have to say: Thank you for the challenge, I really like it. I started the workout 7 days ago and already see good progress. I was not untrained before so I was able to finish the whole thing when I started but was pretty wasted afterwards. Now I can already do every excercise 2 times so I am curious how far I can go in the next days. I just want to aks you: Do you think a break is needed after the 22 days? Is the muscle fatigue building up over time?
Hi, Jeff. Is it safe to workout abs so hard? Isn't there need for train opposite musscless? Low back?
what is an easier exercise for step-through planks?
Im gonna do the challenge lets gooo
when i come to the jacknife i just can't keep my heel off of the ground. Is there a big problem?
Is this OK to do while you're on a strength weight lifting program?
11th day in a row and no soreness!! C`mon guys, lets do it!!
I have a question.. Between the excercises (after you complete each one of them) is there a break for hydration perhaps? or you move to the next excercise at time??  thank you in advance.
day 9 ヽ(*≧ω≦)ﾉ feel DA pain!!! , oh now its gone. anyways work out time 10:40 HERRO!! NO EXCUSES FEEL THE DAM BURN SON.
Anyone else having lower back problems?
Starting over just finished day 1. Had leg surgery
Do I do the six exercises for 22 days in-a-row?
I gotta say while this is brutal and powerful, I think I personally get more out of the 7 minute ab routine video he did awhile back. This does suck though in the best of ways! Anything to failure just hurts. So bad.
Ramadan ?
look at all these people trying to improve themselves! i love it! clicking on the video is the first step YOU NEED TO IMPROVE! Goodluck everyone! :)
Why do I have 3 red sttipes/lines on my abs?
u r a awesome trainer u videos helps us to build body properly
8 day on!!!!!... NO PAIN NO GAIN, feel dam burnt. managed to get more sets of each
too much talking
Day 10. Feeling OK, no sore, it is the best complement to the other CrossTraining drill. Work in progresss!!
what is correct time for exercise
Do these exercises help get rid of belly fat?
whooooo knoooows   - if you'll have abs
I'm definitely glad I came across this video. I'm sore from the gym right now, but I'm starting this tomorrow!
Thanks so much for this great vid coach Jeff. I've been waiting a long time for such an abb workout/ challenge so thx again. Most Deff going to do this one!!!
Day 1. Made it through four rounds of x man crunches
Jeff got new shoes finally
is this something good to do let your belly remove ?
Jeff do you think I can start my workouts with this routine every morning? I usually workout in the mornings.
can i keep doing these exercises past rhe 22 days, like forever until i get more advanced?
Thanks i really wanted something like that,but  one little request suggest some more workouts 》Bodyweight》 (Subscribed) 😉

where is the app of this 22 abs
Should I do this or the 6-Pack Promise program?
Bro I been doin this for 3 days my abs not gettin sore Is it cause I'm doin it wrong
Can someone clarify the Extinction Set thinking ? Doe sit mean that you continue doing Exercise #1 until you reach failure then take a 10 sec breather and go to exercise #2 and on and on OR does it mean you do Ex #1, then 2, 3, etc until you reach failure ?
I was listening to Jcole and this was in my recommended ;-;
Are these exercises ok for someone with herniated disc on L5-S1?
looking for a complex dumbell workout for total
excellent variations of abs movements.. thanks a ton Jeff..
another question, my abs are very sore now it hurts just walking, should I keep tranning or wait 1 day for rest?
I weigh 270lbs and I'm 16 will this help me lose weight? I wanna be around 200lbs by the end of summer
Do you take a break between levels?
i'm on day 4 of 22 and so far my abs and obliques are sore when i wake up the next day.
*L O V E    A T H L E A N   X*
these comments are hillarious
45 minutes until "Go" time! 22 day challenge accepted!
currently on day 6 of the exercise, posted a before video, after  the 22 days are over i will post an after video. will train hard though!
Can you do a RAD140 review please!!?????
Tried them, lowkey died on the floor
on day 5!
Jeff, do you think that X-Men crunch or the stationary bike are good abs exercises?They seem to put a lot of stress onto the neck... I learned to stay away from those kind of exercises and prefer those that put less stress onto the body. What do you think?
I will take the challenge start today 🤘🏼
No rest between exercices, and how many times i have to do the routin every day, just one or i do one with out rest and then then 2 more??
👍
Thanks! I'm comiting this whole month to doing this every night.
8th day in a row! Alive and very well 3 rounds of Heels to heaven , 45 sec each round 2 rounds of Step through plank , 45 sec each round 2 rounds X men crunch , 12 reps each round 2 rounds of Alternating thread the needle , 10 reps each side each round Alternating jackknife , 45 sec Alternating crunch , 30 sec     10 sec rest between rounds Total workout time 10:58
Is this your home gym. I generally not seen anyone coming to your gym. Hence, checking is it so expensive and all the equipments in your gym always look very new...
my abdominal have been burning since I started this I've only just finished day 3
Why is it 45 sec and not a minute? Just wondering
7 days down...15 to go!!!
Jeff makes working out a fun experience!!
Awesome info!
is it possible to have 22 days no rest workout for other parts of the body? like legs, back, chest, etc..? please upload.
how much rest in between exercises after extinction?
You are my goal
Thread the Needle is the devil.
Jeff all of your workouts are amazing. I am glad i made an investment in your product.
How are you supposed to time all of this without stopping to check a watch or something.
This is my day 7 of 22 and honestly its working. Push to the limits because it will workkk. One of those things you love to hate😤
should I do the exercises 22 days straight or break it up? If I should break it up, then what schedule should I have?
just saw this now so I'm gonna try this out tomorrow then recover all weekend and go fresh again from Monday
how fast should I get a six pack if I keep doing this
tomorrow i will start this challenge! see you in 22 days
this is hard as Shit I felt my guts trembling...but I'm gonna get it done I'm determined. I'll update you all when I'm satisfied with this process. peace!
great idea will give this a shot thanks
can you combine this with my regular gym workout I usually do 4 days a week a 1 pull , 2 legs , 3 push , 4 abs(and some shoulder)
I started tonight! Talk to you again on the 22nd of June!
Thx  for  suggestions
I'm pretty sure Jeff's abs have their own abs.
on Alternating Jack knives do you let your shoulder blades touch the ground on the way back or do you keep them lifted all the way trough for the 45 sec?
Jeff! I love to read the descriptions of your videos, they always explain things so we can really learn about the exercises we are doing! But i had to rewatch this video a few times to take note of the exercises and how the extinction worked... I just have one suggestion, someone commented this:  "Vanny note to self  1. Heels to the heaven (45 secs)  2. Step through plank (45 secs)  3. X-man crunch (12 reps)  4. Alternating thread the needle (10 reps each side)  5. Alternating Jack knives (45 secs)  6. Stationary Bikes (30 secs)"  I know it's a lot to ask but this would really help us when we are searching for older videos, to sum up the routine you are showing! Thank you, cheers!!
I'll give this a try, I do have a 4 pack but I want a good six pack, what's the diet for this challenge
how many sets ?
Do you have anything for short chunky guys to get more lean???
Could you really do this for 22 days straight? I mean I'm sore af after just one day  Can you train abs every single day or is that bad?????
Hi Jeff, Couple of questions... 1) you covered this in your "flat belly" video- I'm probably sitting ~12% bodyfat, but I have a bit of a bulge towards the bottom of my abs that makes it look like I have a bit of a paunch and kinda overshadows what little v-cut I have. I suspect it is partially tight hip flexors, and partially overtraining in an attempt to get the v-cut. How would you suggest flattening my abs while working on the v-cut?  2) I had an ACL Reconstruction (patellar tendon autograft) and partial menisectomy ~6 months ago, and have fairly recently started squatting again. Only problem is, after starting to squat again, I started to experience inflammation in both patellar tendons. Is there anything you know of that I can do to reduce the inflammation while getting back into my training regimen?
How do you breathe while doing these exercises?
The people that gave this a thumbs down hate abs. Sucks to be them.
but how many rounds i have to do??
Can you do a full  abs workout video?
Omg the day after i done this workout my abs and my hips flexor hurts so much that i had to walk like an old man.I'm gonna rest for a few days untill i'm recovered maybe i'm just weak idk
Nice abs and presentation.
No soreness, Day 7 in a row, feeling good!! 3 rounds of Heels to heaven , 45 sec each round 2 rounds of Step through plank , 45 sec each round 2 rounds (great improvment) X men crunch , 12 reps each round Alternating thread the needle , 10 reps each side Alternating jackknife , 45 sec Alternating crunch , 30 sec     10 sec rest between rounds Total workout time 9:16
do you have a program for truck drivers who can't hit the gym everyday or can't cook their meals due to being over the road for 4 weeks at a time. if so could you send that info to me thanks
So i'm 3 days in and i know why they call them 'jack knives' now.
Hey Jeff, whenever I  these exercises I feel a massive pain in my lower back muscles, I think because I'm using them more than my abs, do you know how to stop this?
What if after the first day I'm too sore? Should I still try to train with all this pain?
jeff we watch your ads, so you keep making these videos. Our little way of appreciatung your work. Thanks for putting some science in our heads.
Hi. how many times a day are we meant to do this??
Jeff your killing it bro! Being helpful, giving away some great information and guidance yet still have a program that reveals much more. Much success to you! Real hard work, well done
I'll try it!
I went through 7 cycles of "Heels to the heaven" and thought ou hey this is easy... when i got to "Stationary Bikes" couldn't even get my upper body of the ground :D I love it!
ma nam e jeff        sorry :(
with my life decisions, I need only thread the needle once...
you are amazing...for me as a beginner. thanks a lot for the video.
I really like this workout. Could you make more no-equipment workouts like this one?
done about 6 sets of heels to the heavens but after that I was failing everything
so glad jeff got new shoes. his last nikes hit extinction
Sir, Is it good if I do one cycle with all 6 exercise instead of repetition of one?
I went to try this but they kicked me out of the gym as soon as I took my shirt off...
is it for some experienced guys coz when I did 12 rep extinction....I could reach hardly 8 to 9..... please reply
Just started this 22 day challenge, and i'm not gonna quit ^^ I will tell you my results once i'm done :)  ( Just came back from a 1 month rest period, had a lot of fun doing these workouts) :)
I like those puma pants.
Is there Any Pill to make our body like this guy :>
thread the needle hurts my shoulder i'm leaning on. And btw you should update the 6pack promise app, because most of the time when its a" left side , right side" exercise it only loads up 1 side.. soo there is no switch side voice or countdown.   thnx
Myth or not I heard doing abs everyday is not giving time to your abs to recover, anyone got the answer witht this challenge?
day 1 done
PLS ANSWER !!! EVERY DAY ?
man, after this I couldn't plank for 1 minute straight
Apart from this being a fun challenge, will this build a nice set of abs? (nutrition must be on point, that's a given)
Just got the go ahead from the docs to start training again (backpain that caused me to get relived from the military here in norway) and im currently using this, feeling alot better!
Day 6!!!!!... 3 rounds of Heels to heaven , 45 sec  2 rounds of Step through plank , 45 sec X men crunch , 12 reps  Alternating thread the needle , 10 reps each side Alternating jackknife , 45 sec Alternating crunch , 30 sec Total workout time: 8:13
Starting today. Gonna take "Before" and "After" photos.  I trust Jeff, so let's go extinct!
Awesome series.
somebody update me about you doing this
Uuh I get tired very quickly 😩😦😩😦
so you do these excerices for 1 set?
You should make more extinction style workouts for like chest back and legs
i just wanted to say thank you jeff. ive been a persinal trainer for about 2 years now, always been overweight and had mountains of self image issues. watching these workouts (and doing them myself) helps me because i know you pay attention to biomechanics and moving the body how it wants to move. you are a huge inspiration for me, keep doing what youre doing.
ive been doing heels to heaven for 36 hours...
Love your tips and advice, but does he have videos about dieting? All of those exercises won't matter if you can't shed some body day to see the results.
If only this worked. I have just a little to much belly fat 4 my Abs to show
Dude. This is hard. When I reach the jack knives I'm already destroyed hahahaha. Third day without completing the first row of it and the bikes hahaha. But its a good challenge
This is amazing!!
Between this channel and Jeff's "6 Pack" app; a few of the greatest workouts and information available!! Thank you Jeff!
I have been threading the needle since day one. I am almost done sewing a sweater!
going to defiantly take this ab workout for a spin
Hey Jeff! I just wanted to thank you for everything you do and let you know that i purchased your 6 pack promise app 8 weeks ago today, and it has helped my journey to fitness immensely! I'm still at a bpi that you can't see them, but you can feel the abdominal separations there, and my obliques are harder than ever! Keep doing what you're doing my man!
I have watched many videos of his and often times i find he speaks way too much and not enough actual working out content. This video i loved though. I just wish he had a full video like his others of him doing all the reps for 45 seconds so we can follow along with him. Also, i love the ab choices he chose, i am excited to try this! Have a great day!
Isn't this considered over-training?
"oh fuck i made it though again" - me
thanks for the workout
I have made abs workout a habit and trained consistently every day for 3+ months now. This will be next level :)
Made so many gains thanks to this guy! Best on Youtube
Is it just me that feels like the tread the needle is hurting or contrasting my obliques
how much rounds?
thanks Jeff! I just finished, it was killer!
I'd like to see leg routine, without equipment, for cyclists. Thanks.
Thank you for uploading the videos and sharing your immense knowledge with us. i would request you to elaborate leg muscles and their excercises in more details with your marker.. thank you :))
Im at day 2, but im concern because many ppl have said that muscles needs rest and you're harming only yourself if you train same muscle everyday. Can someone explain why i should continue to do this everyday?
Am on Day 4.....18 to go. I won't Quit. I will update to extinction
I really have trouble understanding when you can work on the same muscle group again, why is it that you can train abs every day after an intense workout but only biceps once a week after an intense workout?
this is an amazing plan. with this I know no matter what level I get to I can always make it harder the next time. thank you so much.
Awesome abs workout my abs are sore
How many times do I have to do the 6 exercises?
day 1 after effects, abs hurt    question: does this target lower abdominals
Hey Jeff, definitely gonna try, probably gonna cry a lot, but see you in 22 days
No rest between exercices, and how many times i have to do the routin every day, just one or i do one with out rest and then then 2 more??
This workout would be a lot easier if I didn't have to do it on slippery carpets. Friction burns everywhere.
how many reps per day?
I'm a beginner about trainer but I'm doing this. I'll check back in 22 days as well.
Thanks! On my 2nd. Day! Question? After the 22 days? Is this something to maintain on a daily basis?
not easy but love it. thank you ....😀😆
Damm.... you feel the pain.. great shit
Hi, how many time per day do I need to do this routine?
any iphone app to costomize a clock for doing HIIT or this 45 secs for each ab set?
ok day 1 and counting thx so much!
can i get  paks then how to
hey! great video, i love staying as simple as possible for training and this looks like something perfect for my! I'm starting it today! just one question, i'm not sure i heard anything about the rest time. can anybody tell me?
I've been following this for 5 days now but have huge problems with keeping my lower back on the ground(especially with the X man crunches). Does anyone have any tips for me? I'd appreciate it!
U can`t workout abs everyday, the muscles needs rest to grow :)
so excited for this workout
sweet, challange acepted
is there any workout like that for legs ?????
Sorry if this is a little off topic, but does anyone know what the name of Nike shoes he is wearing is?
Can any of u boiz give me tips on how to do the stationary bike? i'm really struggling with this one, having done the previous exercises; I just find it impossible to lift both shoulder blades off the ground?
it's not for beginner very hard moves..
I am interested in an answer to the legitimate concerns posted in many of the comments about this being a bad idea for tight hip flexors.
who be coming every day to remember these exercises
If I can complete this, I will give myself a six pack as a reward.
Day 5 down!!... 3 rounds of Heels to heaven , 45 sec  2 rounds of Step through plank , 45 sec X men crunch , 12 reps  Alternating thread the needle , 10 reps each side Alternating jackknife , 45 sec Alternating crunch , 30 sec Total workout time: 8:25
I'm going to try this on my next abs day.
How come every exercise requires about 24-28 hours rest but abs you can do everyday?
The program is challenging 👍🏻but I want to ask a question , should I move on to another exercise when I am exhausted in the middle of action (e.g. Half of the progress)
Jeff is God
Day one 😄👍
today i will try this to my other stuff
Fucking love this shit
Day 1 down! It's definitely worth it! takes about 15-20 minutes, but it's a major burn in a short amount of time! Wish me luck on the next 21!
thanks
I'll be back...
Re: extinction concept.  So, if you can do the stated time or number of reps, you do it again? But what if you have trouble doing it again in good form/to completion? Just keep at it?
Awesome man!
How do I stop the soreness .! First day and I'm already sore the next.? Fight through it.?
Thanks! I'll start tomorrow. :)
Jeff ❤️
need this thanks picture back in 22 days
Today, May 29th, I will start doing this. I will try to do this every day for 22 days and see how I do. The reason I said try is because due to upcoming events I might not be home all day but if I find free time I definitely will do it. Wish me luck! I will try my best. Day 1, here we go.
Day 2 done. Didn't do as well as yesterday time and rep wise. Really feeling it.
Day 2. Lovin this!
I did this and liked it and felt the wonderful abdominal burn and walked away happy. The only problem is that it was a 20+ minute workout.  I can see this working really well with beginners and people at an intermediate level, but I think at a certain level it's not the most pragmatic approach. I'm not claiming to be super fit or amazing, but I think I would opt for a different program. (I love his 7-minute ab workout posted on Jan. 5th.)  Conclusion: it's probably great for certain levels, but once you've graduated, move onto something more intensive. That's my opinion. : )
Day 2 down 20 to go.
am i resting between exercises?
Could you do a deadlift tutorial?
is it workout good while im fasting?
I feel like im doing everything wrong
how tall you are ??
how to make body without supplements??
@0
thank you sir for telling this
but when i do as muc as i can at one exercise i cant do the next exercise
Challenging workout and a great way to give everybody the oppurtunity to try this workout!! Good work Jeff!
I don't think you will answer this but hey, nothing ventured, nothing gained! I have a scoliosis and am wondering if making this is a good idea, will it hurt my body or not, if I do the lower back exercise in your video "(sit happens)", is it okay to do this 22 day workout ? It would be great if I could get an answer ^^
thanks buddy I'll try for 22 days
can you please make videos on thai workout
Does Jeff Flex before every video? Cas he looks PUMPED asf
so if i cant finish it under 45 sec i go to the next potition?
Thanks
challenge accepted
I recently purchased the ax1 program and I have a concern All I have is one 40 lb one 30 lb and one 20 lb bumbell I don't have a pair of anything I'm a week in and have felt bad that I haven't been able to do but one side at a time with each workout will this effect anything or is it okay
This is easily best channel on YouTube.....
Jesus... this looks like death, keen to give it a go though tomorrow
Hello man! you are Awesome!!! I would like to ask you if there is a way of getting fitter in 30 days. I am already on nutritionist control and want to go back working Out. I would like to Get fitter as much as I can this month. Is there Hope for me?  thanks!
I could only do about half as many on the second day LOL
We should do this 22 days every day??
Hey jeff! Should i do this exersices before or after hitting the gym?
i am at day 1 and my abs are sore af i recommend everyone to do it
I'm going to try this
Can we try this if we have anterior pelvic tilt.
Brutal but doable. Had to do a second partial on the first two. But quick question: anyone have a good alternate for threading the needle? I have an acute tendinitis in my right supraspinatus (waiting on a surgery date), so that rotation on my right shoulder is a complete impossibility. I can hold a pushup or plank on it, just not by itself and definitely not with this kind of open rotation.
i am starting this today. one down and 21 more to go. wish me luck. because i already feel day 1
Jeff recommends doing ab exercises for 5 to 6 days a week, but isn't that too much? Aren't you going to over-train your abs? Or am I missing something here, like that the abs are targeted in a less stressful way compared to your pecs in heavy benching for instance? In order to let the ab muscles grow you need to inflict some micro-damage to the muscle and give the muscle some time to recover, doing these routines for 6 days straight seems like a little to much of the good stuff to me. Please shower me with your knowledge people, so I can learn something today :).
how can I measure time while I'm working out?
Wow this is really nice! Will do my best to do it for 22days.
Beautiful
Pls do one for chest :D
looks promesing
I think you should make this video again with timer.
Day 4... MUCH better than yesterday!!!!!! 3 x Heels to heaven , 45 sec  Step through plank , 45 sec X men crunch , 12 reps  Alternating thread the needle , 10 reps  Alternating jackknife , 45 sec Alternating crunch , 30 sec Total workout time: 7:17
im 15 yr old boy can i do this workout??
I got a 6pack by just watching this video
jeff can you make a video HOW TO CONTRACT/SQUEZZE OBLIQIES sorry for bad english like if you agree so jeff can see this
I use your 6 pack ab promise app and you do exactly the same thing. It works great! Glad I came across it in the app store. Every week I see more of an improvement on myself. If anyone wants a good ab program go down his 6 pack abs promise app in the app store it comes with a food guide and also is connect to YouTube so if you wanna see the recent video's he just posted you can see it there.
i hope its work in 22 days nice video   ....
Coach why is my lower abs hurt so bad?
Man. I tried this is didn't get through any of those. And the rep ones I only got through a couple each. Excited to see how much I improve in 22 days!
Let's See. be back in 22 days.
my first set lasted 8 minutes 35 seconds this takes too long
So the challenge is to do these consistent 45 second workouts until you can't anymore each day for 22 days? I'm just wondering is this healthy because I've heard that it's best too work on abs around three days a week. Would doing this daily be an issue?
Great video!
Love it Jeff 👍💪🏻
I tried searching- but does anyone know what shoes Jeff has on?
I need rest after 22 secs, I think it's because I eat too much honey.
honestly your videos are the best
Hi, I'm not a native English speaker, what do you mean with Extinction??
Holly shit youre ripped
see chest workout with no weights
Loving your stuff!
"nothing worth having comes easy" - bob kelso.Scrubs  Love this man even more now
that look's pretty badass... I start today!! Just one question: should I train everyday? or 3-4 times a week and let muscles rest a bit?
Do how to get scott Adkins chest from undisputed as Yuri Boyka
this is why you are my unofficial Fitness Guru
failed to specify rest time between ab excercise veriations.
Wow.. core crushing exercises.. gonna try frm tomorrow
Thank you! Truly the only video channel I subscribe to for fitness knowledge upkeep.
I could use some advice on this, started this workout 2 days ago and this is my third day, as well as mixing in cardio. My abs are still very sore form yesterday and they've been uncomfortable, should I proceed with the workout today or rest my abs and focus something else? This ain't an excuse, I want to do it but I fear causing some actual damage.
can't wait to start this!
So if we do this for 22 days then we will get abs?
hey jeff, my friend told me he thinks you're vegan. Is that true?
hi Jeff, I have a question for you. I'm getting a severe ab pain when I perform the heals to the heaven. I get this in the first set around 9th count. please help out from this pain. it's a severe pain and after that for sometime I can't able to get up from the floor. but it goes away after sometime. I was already performing lots of ab exercises couple of years back and discontinued.
In the jack the knives workout why did you just bend your right leg and not your left?
See you in 22 days with a video response well 23... 1 edit day .Good luck to everyone joining in this fight!
I will tell u my result in 22 days wish me luck.
Lets go MOFOOO!!! 29/05 starting day. ¿quién dijo miedo?
Hey Jeff just an observation. During your jack knife I saw that your right leg appears to bend when you rep while your left leg stays straight..... is that a flexibility issue or shorter muscle ? just wondering
are climbers a good core exercise
Sore on day 2 :D that's goood
i will star today see you in 22 days  wish me luck,
Awesome! Love all of these exercises!
Aren't you supposed to rest a day between workout out a muscle group??
i will definitely start doing this from today !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
rest time between each exercise?
ATHLEAN-X less talk more work pls pls .. all respect <3
i need to know the name of those shoes!
I love this guy.
Jeff here is a nutrition question, how does a person who works at night with a crazy sleep schedule and unable to eat 6 times a day should handle their nutrition requirements. Do my sleep schedule I only get the 3 square a day? Please your thoughts.
Awesome video!
Great video Jeff, looking forward to trying it out!
Wouldn't it make more sense to complete every exercise once before you restart the cycle? If you can't make one to the end, you still go to the next one, but that way you avoid fatigue after hitting only one muscle group, which would hinder you with the other ones.
May you do a video like this one but for a back workout please? 😉💪 btw Awesome videos 👌
How much rest do you get in between each exercise
Any rest between the exercises ?
Plz i need a workouts to my anckle after surgery
it looks easy when Jeff does it but ITS FUCKING NOT
Can we do the ab workout everyday or 22 days like Jeff mentioned? I heard we shouldn't do abs more than 2-3 times a week? Wont we need the recovery?
HERE ARE MY RESULTS FOR THE DAY: my body is the exact same as the guy on the grass behind jeff
Will update this on 19th June. Today is 28th May
I always face the problem of lower back pain whenever i train abs!! What should I do and what is happening wrong?? I am just at the beginning level!!
How much time per exercise? Pós any1 reply
What time is the best to do this workout?
i'll do that after my normal workout
The first exercise is my favorite one for abs! :)
This is the extinction level event that ended the dinosaurs.
i actually have an idea, you should be able to make your own circuits for the siz pack app, if would help a lot in making your own kind of workouts
I thought working on your abs everyday was bad or is that false ?
could you put this in the six pack app
Would it be a good idea to add some light weights to thread the needle and the x-man crunch?
I was 286lbs 5 weeks ago I now weight 241. I completely changed my life by changing my diet and exercise. I don't have money for a gym. I have 1 dumbbell, 1 ball for crunches, and an elliptical. all of your videos are great and many are helping me on my daily workouts and this is great. I am a beginner and yes at 40 years old it isn't easy but I'm gonna get in shape or die trying. keep up these amazing videos and thank God for videos like this to help guide a noob like myself.
Thank you Jeff Cavalier
i will subcribe if this vid really work out
i will subcribe if this vid really work out
hello ?
22 Days! Ready set Go!..... See you again in 22. Okay see you again next video! 👍
Fantastic excercise!
I will try but i will fail cus i am Only 13 years old
My problem with this is that some of these exercises are actually pretty hard to take to failure as such. The workout would become extremely frustrating and tedious.
Should we do this after weight lifting?
Amazing man
How much rest do you take between each exercise?
I prefer to incorporate some hanging ab exercise for the extra stretch. But otherwise I will give it a shot, looks good.
wonder what drugs this guy uses
I wish to see more of the finishing workout like"the End shoulder workout" for other group of muscles
Am I able to do this every day, if so why?
Sir can you post a video for chest
Hi Jeff. I can do most of the exercises on the "22 Day" program, with the exceptions of "X-man crunch" and "Jackknife". They hurt my back from the 2nd or 3rd rep. Are there any substitutes that you recommend? Like the "figure-of-eight" for example? And thanks for all these great videos!
Is this guy a natty?
20 Days to go baby
I'd like to have these exercises incorporated in 7 min follow along workout. Actually, I'm going to do it myself.
tried it for the first time... died😥 but it was awesome. hope to keep it up for more then 22 days.
I think you did a little too much just by looking at the thumbnail lol jk nice work.
Day 3... much better... 2 x Heels to heaven , 45 sec  Step through plank , 45 sec X men crunch , 12 reps  Alternating thread the needle , 10 reps  Alternating jackknife , 45 sec Alternating crunch , 30 secTotal workout time: 6:42
s aight let's start I will update every day
How about something for a bad lower back to strengthen the core pls
thanks...
amazing workout plan......will definitely try this one
This dude looks more jacked with each video. Is he still natural?
Yep yep. on it. see yall in 22days
@athlean-x you should have us send you the results and make a video on it
Will i get rid of belly fat?

I'm starting in the morning since it's almost midnight in my country. I will also do a variety of push-up exercises after each ab workout. would be awesome if you could do a push up challenge as well without equipment. thanks jeff! you're the real MVP
Gonna start this from from May 29th, gonna return and comment the results on 14th June...let's see
day 1.
So if I can't make the goal, do I rest  before moving on to the next exercise? or do I only earn rest if I make the goal and earn another round?
what if i kept on eating cheese burgers everyday?
Starting this today, I have a decent 6 pack but my body fat hides some of it so I have to flex to show it and my bottom 2 abs are not as defined as the starting two. I will take pictures before and after. Good Luck to everyone else.
keep a video what to consume to increase weight faster for skinny people
i accept your challenge!
See that sports Ticker in the background? That's sick AF!
Is there a PDF or some kind of document for these exercises in order??
dont go on this every muscle need a rest pause after 4 days dont be stupid
Have you gone over program design? Meaning how to set up your week of training, ex: what muscle groups on which days, etc...?
how you keep your face slim and thin?  why i have double chin :(
Sir I Wana ask that. Does low level of testosterone Effect the muscle growth? And with high testosterone can muscles Grow Fast?  Please Answer these Questions.
But why 22 days tho
I can always do the workout but I can't do the diet. I'm only 16 and I can't afford any of the foods I need. mannn!!!

I will do it for today ... see you after 22 days

wait so I have to do this workout everyday for 22 days??
challenge accepted
hm... is it weird if I told you I have abs even thought I barely exercise? It's weird and I can't find anything related on the internet...smh?
How can you do this as a beginner, when you get sore AF after day 1? I can ignore it I suppose, but is that really healthy tho? shouldn't the muscles regenerate fully? or do they regenerate enough after 24hrs?
please  translate in Arabic
This dude's body is just like a dragon ball z character
i just wonder who dislike this vídeo....
dont jerk off on non cardio days.
gonna use these 💪
Great workout! But don't you need some rest days to let your muscle repair?
what to do if my lower back curls when doing some ab exercises on the floor? I know you are supposed to keep your back flat at  the ground but can't at some exercises
Brilliant
I thought it takes about 3 months to form/break a habit?
thank u man u helped me a lot with my work out cus u motivated me thanks a lot
Hey Jeff what should be my macros ? I'm 16 and 115 pounds I was looking at your work systems but I'm not sure if they come with daily nutrition goals as well , that's really what I need help with .
Nice timing on this video, I was considering a similar type of video discussion as well.
Ima find out if this shit works, see y'all in 22 days.
The workout is so hard there is a dead vuy in the back
can't comprehend those negative people after watching this had the guts to thumb down...
Hey, sorta an unrelated question but how often is it good to have cheat meals? One meal a week? Once every 2?
You do this exercise once everyday?
I wonder if you took Jeffs abs, and put them on the roads we drive on. They'd make some wicked speed bumps
I wanna see a sale going on for Memorial Day!!!
sub me i will sub you back
One of the best vids so far
What if my the eighth day I can't even get out of bed
jeff thank you for all your great help and advice alot of people of people on utube don't know what the hell they are talking about and really shouldn't be giving any advice at all. your the best jeff.

This dude is ripped ....
Perfect for the summer :D, gonna try that from today.
Hey Jeff since Ramadan has started I was wondering if you could make a Ramadan workout?
maybe i will add this workout into some of my trainnigs :) :)
my back won't bend enough to allow me to contract my abs properly
Jeff please tell how to lose face fat,
THANKS a lot for making this video, love all of these unique set of exercises.
Holy cow, your biceps are massive
Jeff!!! You rock man! I was trying to have something to make me be consistent 100% so that I will not have any excuses and all this stuff.. MAN what the hell?? You are reading your followers' minds now? :D :D Counting 22 days from now! Thanks a lot! Wish me luck fellas!
@trainer2thepros On Hardcore Training Days should I stick to this the 22 day workout or do the prescribed workout? Or do my 22 work in the evening?
First try:  Heels to heaven 3 rounds and a half  X sits 3 rounds and a half  Leg slide through plank 4 rounds  Pinch the needle 3 rounds  Alternating jackknives 1 round and a half  Stationary bike: 5 rounds and a half
Why do you bend one leg a bit on the alternating jack knives?
Awesome!!
Hi Jeff, I really like your videos. I strained my left hamstring doing squats. Could you do a video on rehabilitation exercises? That would be awesome
can you  put together some abs workout that doesn't effect anterior pelvilt tilt ?
Jeff wearing new sneakers means this workout is going to be brutal to a whole new level.
I would love to see you make a video explaining why the 30 day bicep challenge is a horrible idea, or if it actually works make a video showing why it's a good idea to do
you are handsome!!!
bro how many times we should rep those exercises
challenge accepted
dont train ur abs every day over training is not good cuase ur only goin to get strength but not muscle growing that what boxers do they train there abs every day cuase they only lookin for strength and not growing

Hello Jeff or can anyone help me find the video/link where you have the video about proper shoulder position when you're doing military presses with dumbbells? please and thank you all.
stationary bike to finish? better go super Saiyan
Jeff you should appear on American Ninja Warrior
@ATHLEAN-X does drinking apple cider vinegar help with fat loss? I've been drinking apple cider vinegar in the mornings for about 2 weeks now and want to hear your professional opinion on it.
I'm sorry for the question, this workout its for Women too? Thanks very much.
thanks Jeff (22 times)
just got done with first day.. man this got me sweating. .
Jeff you honestly have the physique that most men want to get when they start working out. Slim but muscular, women love it
thank u sir...
Nice program but I don't believe it's good to work only on the abs
I love the idea, but doesnt these exercises activate too much the hip flexors? Maybe it isnt the best daily routine for the avg person who may have them a bit tight  (unless you also do daily streches)
do you think jeff gets a pump before vids
one word...AWESOME! hated during/ loved after completed!!
Hi man! Can you please do the same thing but for the Chest! Thanks so much! ❤️❤️
Hi Jeff. I've been doing the seven minute abs work out for a week and a half. What do you recomend, to keep doing the seven min work out or switch to this work out?
Hi jeff I definitely like this style of working out. Is it possible to do this extinction style of working out for the chest and legs.
hey @ATHLEAN-X please do a work out vid with no equipment use just like this one but for building pecs PLEASE.
Can you show us your workouts that you do weekly (like your weekly routine)
FUCK YEAH love you Jeff Saw another nigga put a 21 ab workout but hid it behind a fucking a fucking $67 paywall, with you, you motivate me and tell me what the fuck to do, no excuses. keep up the good work!
what can I do to get rid of belly fat

Fantastic video. Great workout for beginners who need to build strength base for L sits and stuff like that.
How can u work out for 22 days with no rest? xD
This looks awesome!  Gonna go for this and let you know how I did!
So this work out is just once a day? Or if we can morning and evening?

It should be called the belly melter :) Thanks for the value!
Im going to start this and everyday i do it Im going to put done here. WIsh me luck :)
Dude you look like Christian Bale in Batman
solo who's the camera man ?
The crunchs arent hard, but after I did all the exercises before, i chouldn't do 1
what is better? this exercise for 22 days or your 6 pack promise app for 56 days?
Day 2😎. Dig deep👊🏽💪🏼
Is any one know which shoes he's wearing?
Thank You..
Do this with no preparation: Get injuried .
Is this good for fat loss guys?
Hey Jeff. its Ramadan now, Can you make a video where you talk about what a person should do for not loosing muscle mass, and for lossing weight.
what about rest??
Is this something I can do when I get home from the gym or should I finish my weight training program before I start this?
leg sore before abs
U realy helped me bro whit ur videos
I have been lean bulking for the past 5 months, my chest, biceps, triceps back, shoulders all look lean but my abs aren't visible. I also have some lower belly fat and love handles, what should I do to burn them off? The rest of my body is lean it's just my belly fat and love handles, any ideas?
plz can you make for use video about Ramadan work out , during fasting for 18 hours
jeff do a video on anterior pelvic tilt strengthening muscle workout.
Great routine, seems like an advanced version of your 6pack in under 10 minutes workout . Definitely trying it out
Dude, your biceps have biceps! Good ab workout Im gonna give that a go!
i gotta do all these exercises once a day for 22 days?
this workout do before eating or after eating
Let me make this simple. He takes of his shirt because he believes in proof positive. No drugs etc. He educates simply but scientifically. Other than a few, he doesn't do it for a supplement company (listen no one hated Jordon for selling shoes).  Stop your complaining unless you are professional or scientist who can argue intelligently. Or invite yourself to his gym, pay $1k and try to keep up for 30 minutes. Done.
With the key and lock obliques one I don't feel it- I can do them for literally years- fast, slow, whatever It's probably because so much of it is done by my back- how do I focus it on my sides?
jeff the kind of guy that generates a lot of "the kind of guy" comments
I do my ab workout every day since more then 10 years. I do bout 1000 reps every day. Guess Im obsesed :-)
What's the difference between this workout for 3 weeks and his other ab workouts for 3 weeks?
MADE IT ALL THE WAY THROUGH!!... watching the video 😂😂
I'm fasting... But should be able to push through
great video!  nice job!
Thank you Mr Jeff for your guidance, with the form you reach I've been able to lift heavier and safely. This one starts today. Also i wish if only i could afford your program, I'd definitely would have purchased it. Big fan.
in the next video you do with JESSE give us a current before and after comparison photo to show us how everything you have been showing us with jesse is actually working
tips on what to do during ramadan
I'll be back in 22 days
Hey man can you please make us a video about working out in Ramadan, and how not to lose our gains during this fasting month?
3:32 if you squint enough, you can see the face on his abs, it looks like saying :   Help me !
Thankyou soo much!!  I gonna do it,  no excuses :)
I already have washboard abs but I'm gonna give this a try. See you in 22 days...
you should grow a moustache Jeff. and some chest hair... could be manly af
Would be helpful if the videos demonstrating the exercise were to follow one another at the end.
How to contact you to clarify my doubts...? Please help me ..... Please give your email or phone number...
it is just for sixpack
hi jeff can you do video on how to train in ramadan. its a month where muslims fast 4 29 or 30 days. would really appreciate it
what about the diet plan?
I don't think I can go to the gym for 22 days straight
Lets try :D
omg, just did this the first time, and i thought i was a beginner but i got 19 sets and 30 seconds for the first exercise, so i was pumped, and then the rest of the exercises i got like a set at the most or not even the whole rep extinction. this really works, i was sweating during the first exercise, and i plan to do this the next 21 days too! thanks Jeff!
looks exciting.
Anyone ever thought what Jeff would like if he didn't workout? No offense intended!
Wow just done this workout and felt muscles I never knew I had, this is a brutal ab workout. thx Jeff this is day one for me :)
So theres a lot of stuff going around about "different body types" i.e. Endomorph mesomorph etc, they say certain body types shouldn't do cardio or whatever or certain body types can't get big, is this just a myth to make us feel better/ buy peoples programs? Or is there some truth to it? Jeff you are really the only person i feel i can trust to answer this
Hi ..really good video. Any changes for joints protection video?
And what should i do if the next day my abs hurt? should i just keep going?
Jeff, could you please please please do a sore in six minutes Athlean Xero version ?
Need one of these for chests
the best natural one.
but what about our diet ????
Do something like this but for arms, using just our body, no equipment at all. That will be awesome. Thanks.
how many sets for this exercises?PLEASE!
Definitely worth a try for sure.
What do you reckon the lowest age is to do the XERO program?
we can 22days ? no rest day
How long should we be resting between each exercise? Since you go to failure for each one, it's pretty impossible to start the next one right away
Day 2... done!! Better but still burning...
Don't be afraid to switch up the order. Fatigue the muscle before doing one of your strong points. Also will have you hitting areas you need to work on. Ex: Heel lifts are easy for you; therefore  do them last
any alternate exercise for Alternate thread needle and splank ? I'm too heavy for it :(
Going to Italy June 14th gotta turn on the AFTERBURNERS
Everybody made fun of his shoes in one of his videos, now look at his new shoes! Jeff's shoe game on fire!
294 996 views in one day? this are are rich!
what if the person has a stomach hernia, what do you do in that case.
ok im in here we go
I've been doing my first round of Nuclei overload training on biceps, currently 18 days in. This ab workout is along the same grain as it: 2-4 weeks of the same muscle group.  I'm eager to see if it works as well as they say. The outcome isn't to gain mass which does happen, it's to improve the ability to gain mass by increasing the nucleus in the muscle
Jeff, could make a video on the Keto diet thats been going viral lately!! Thanks!
jeff lookin ripped as fuck lately
Ez. *tries workout* ... ... ... ... ... Not Ez
My lower back starts to hurt when doing most exercises, in particular sit ups and planks, am I doing something wrong?
that thread the needle really hurts my shoulders, weak shoulders or is there a technicality m messing up?
What a horrible Intro sound.. I think I just lost my hearing.
If there's anyone who haven't downloaded the AthleanX 6 pack app, do so now. You get all these ab variations and more on it.
hey jeff,can you make the videos of the 22 days workout of other body parts?it will be great for us who can't always go to gym
Time to get ripped.  22 days, I'm ready.
Could you do a zombies stream tomorrow?
his body is mad lean
Does anyone have a good protein bar they could recommend?
Probably a very dumb question but forgive me Im not pretending to know what Im talking about is there a best time in the day to do this like is it better to do it in the mornings or at night or anything like that I've been cracking down on my diet and lost 25lbs so far and am looking to push it further just wanna make sure Im hitting all the right points thanks :)
what exactly is "failure"?? is it untill you physically cant do it anymore? or is it to the point where when you do it, your form is wrong and you cant do a perfect form
So, is is 45 seconds on, 10 seconds off until failure for each exercise basically?
oh no my precious excuses and easy work outs!
it's my birthday. 39. wish I could look like jeff.
Jeff who's going to win the finals. You or the Warriors
step through planks, i don't know how you make this look so easy. My hips just dont rotate like that i guess.
This guy natural?  Or on the gear?
Look at those SHOES!!!! Hell ya... looking good Jeff!
Can i do this routine in every morning in 22days and keep my workout in àternoon ?
Definitely going to try this out!
I like that got to try it
There is no way dis dude is natty
zoo gym.
Can you add a Ramadan workout?
Let try this for 21days
Anyone else so use to seeing people like Jeff that other ripped people start looking normal? And then you look at yourself in the mirror and think...
Brutal. My lower back gives out before my abs but they still get beat up! Great moves, I finally feel a workout in my obliques!
But your holding 2 fingers on one hand and 1 finger on the other
Give this a try you said... Your joking I do 30 sit-ups before bed and I think I'm dying lol. Im literally dragging my self into bed and lying there with pain!!! Wished I could do this though but it's whey to much! 😐😳😔
i like it
I should be doing ab workouts but I hate them sooooo much =( Probably because I suck at them xD I'll try it, let's hope it sticks!
Great sequence and collection of ad exercises!   Thank you!
thanks man ur the best, all start at this program tomorrow will be fasting for a month soo right own Tim, all come back after 20 days to tell the results,  which me luck, we're all gonna make it brahs.  Salut from Algeria 💪💪💪
10/10 love this 👌🏿👌🏿
This is a bitch! I only made it to extinction one 5 of the 6 exercises, thus failing to make it through a second round of those exercises.  The exercise I couldn't complete was the Thread the Needle. I've never done it from a front plank position and it tripped me up big time. will work on that. Also, I had to sub out the alternating jackknifes, a few reps in and my lower back was in pain. Did the beginner "21" crunch in place of it.
Starting this today!!!!
I will do this and come back 22 days later
No more excuses Let's do this!!!!!! See y'all in 21 days
Skeleton in the back is so depressed he hasnt got abs doing this
Lol same confused about everything's

This workout looks tough ! Gonna try this tomorrow and comment back how I get on !
Please do a video on how to achieve a physique like Cristiano Rinaldo's. What sort of diet/supplements should I follow. Also the types of workout he does over the course of the week besides just football training. Would appreciate this very much thanks 😀👍
Hey everyone, i would like some help! Im 5'5 ,108 pounds & quite small tho very strong..  I lift DAILY exept sunday.I am about to bulk for an estimated 45 days while on vacation. How many calories should i be eating? I have calculated 1500 for maintainance so 2 things 1- is that correct? 2- How many calories to build muscle correctly. Thanks
It's a killer ab workout
fuck my life I'll stick with crunches
ok i'll start ........... tomorrow :D :D :D , or maybe next week
started this today! this ain't no joke I'm drippin sweat! lets get it!🔥🔥💪💪
I'd like to see a video on working out over 40. I'm 39 and have been out of the gym for a long time now. Anything from Jeff for us middle-aged guys would be top notch!
First like then i watch :)
I felt good doing two and half sets of x cross crunches... But I could not do a single set of jack knifes T>T
We all have abs, right? Mine just have a layer of insulation I'd like to get rid of.
nothing worth having will be easy -Jeff 2017
Holy shit this pulls through!! Just did this variation after a cardio session and I'm about dead. THANKS JEFF!
Wouldn't this train the lower abs more? Because you're going to have more energy starting out and maybe do 3 rounds or so for lower abs but then be worn out and only get maybe 1 for the top abs.
Jeff, i love your channel. its a bastion of quality content on youtube. but your leaving production gains on the table. your max resolution is 720p. Its 2017 bro can we please get full HD 1080 videos. not asking for 4 k or anything but 720 just looks dated these days and your PHENOMENAL content deserves more pixels. Keep up the good work
im doing this and wont give up. !
i dislocated my shoulder 3 weeks ago,how long should i wait to start whit this
Awesome again Jeff! Please, demonstrate a good set of exercises to grow some glutes...GLUTES, man!!!!

Anyone want to start this challenge with me tmr?
goddamit I'm currently doing Scott Herman's 400 rep a day ab challenge which lasts a month. once that finishes I guess I'm doing this 22 day one
it would be awesome if you added this to your app
Great video as always Jeff, thank you! I missed some infos about the time span though. Why 22 days? And why do the ab muscles need lesser or no rest than other muscles?  Also, I'd like to ask you for a video about deloading. Whats your opinion on that topic? Do you deload? How do you deload, how often do you deload and for how long do you deload? Couldn't find a video on that topic on your channel.  Thanks for your work Jeff!
Jeff make a video on why its not a good idea to use the same arm to jerk off all the time and how stretch those muscles.
Hey, it's Tony NoGainz over there!
Thank you
Fantastic work out Jeff! I am 60 years old and was able to do 45 seconds of each exercise. My wife wants me to have a ripped stomach. I certainly appreciate your effort and enjoy trying these workouts every day.  Jeffrey
Why does it take so long to build muscle... come-on grow grow grow
I will try this Jeff! Thanks a lot!!
How would you get the "checker board"
Well I will try this out even so it's the Ramadan month but I will do it try hard mode on 😤😤😤😤
"..you are gonna die off somewhere in between..."  That's assuring Jeff...
Thanks for this one bro, this will be my starter workout from now on
Heels to Heaven did it fully 5 times Step Through Plank fully 4 times X men crunch 25 reps Altering Thread and Needle 30 reps Altering Jack Knife 2 full times died in the end of the 3 Stationary Bike 3 full times died in the middle of the 4 Is this good or bad? personly think this is very average.
Would like to see these workouts on the 6 pack promise app
About to hit the Rich Piana 8 hour arms. 💀
Hey i was just wondering if jeff competes
they guide very well.great coach.
If i ever become rich Jeff will be my personal trainer  In fact i'm gonna freaking buy him off  such a knowledgeable person Hats off man.
I love these videos!  Thanks and definitely going to try this.  I've been struggling to come up with a consistent ab routine and this looks like it will be a great way to do it.  You sir are a steely eyed missile man!
jeff is the only one i trust on youtube
I need a six pack by tomorrow night. What should I do Jeff?
awesome i will be doing this, thank you.
Why does anyone have to hate?! Jeff offers these videos for our own benefit, and they are great. No gym, no problem, he even offers a home workout program! How great is that? It's awesome! Thanks for these amazing videos and help us get stronger!!!
Do we do this everyday for 22days? I thought we are suppose to do 1-2days while weight training using the push pull legs method.
great
great Jeff
I never do a single set of ab workout, I find it's a waste of time and energy
is it ok for me to do this while fasting in ramadan  i mean in terms of losing weight, i dont want to lose that much weight since i weigh 65 kg
Help me LORD damnnnnn Jeff you are the man thanks
Challenge accepted!
What if I do the ab workout and then the next day I'm really sore. Do I still do the ab workout even if I won't be able to do as much???
Copy and paste this into your notepad on your phone/computer for an easy way to track your progression if you plan on taking this challenge on!  22 day ab challenge  Once you are able to complete the recommended time/reps. Rest 10 seconds and repeat again until reaching extinction  The workout A: Heels to the heavens 45 seconds B: Step through planks 45 seconds C: X man crunch 12 reps D: Alternating thread the needle 12 reps per side E: Alternating Jackknives 45 seconds F: Stationary bikes 30 seconds   Day 1 A: B: C: insert your times here and so on  D: for the next 22 days to  E: track your progression  F:
you dont overtrain the abs by doing this every day?
Jeff, how long should you rest in between failure and the next exercise? I'm definitely going to try this!!
Awesome workout going to start day one today
What do we do after the 22 days of the ab workout. Repeat?

Dammit. I did my workout today already. And tomorrow is my rest day. But I will start Sunday. I will try this. I want to come back in 22 days and say I did it! No rest, just gains!
Thank you bro :) Also make some video about some natural diet to build muscle  like what to eat and what not eat to build muscle  i want an average muscle body
doing this 22 days will that ovetrain or do something bad  to ur core
Hello Jeff. I love your videos on not using any equipment since I don't have any and more often I try to workout at home. The workout was amazing and I want to try it but everytime I try it my lower back aches it even hurts my neck while doing crunches. Could you help me out with this issue. I am overweight at the moment.  P.S. My lower back generally does ache even when I am not exercising. Could this be serious?
I'm starting this today, see you in 22 days with my six pack woooow
look how lean the guy is standing behind his left shoulder; Talk about shredded!!!
Amazing info! Thanks for this post. Keep it up and God bless.
Heels to heaven - I felt some cracking when  going down, not really sure but I think is my lower back  Step through plank - My back failled beforemy abs  Alternating jackknife - Can't do a single one.  Any idea why I feel the crack and why I cant do jacknifes?
today is back day for me. can i workout my abs on the same day as back?
How to reduce the risk of getting an injury in the back?
I got a McDonald's ad under this video
I find it real hard too find the balance in some of the exercises have you got any tips for that?
Jeff, my brother... nike shoes with puma pants...  you are a legend!!!!!! dual sponsorships.
I know what I'm doing the first 22 days of June. Thanks Jeff!
WOW you make this look so easy hahaha
Day 2: Yeap, fuck this. I am done
Without rest this looks a little dangerous to me, it sure is helpful to gain strength but I'm not sure about about muscle gain can anybody help me understand the reason behind it?
Please do the rest of Zac Efrons workouts!! Would love your input on his back & bicep day and his leg day
This is most definitely the best ab video Jeff has ever produced. Good shit, Jeff.
Great video !
sir could you do a video about Ramadan time training it would be helpful for to maintain the body during Ramadan
rest time between?
Tks Jeff, so glade i'm a subscraber
Every day ?
my next 3 weeks ought to be fun
Any suggestions on good exercises to strengthen your wrists?
how much do you rest bettwen exercises?
Jeff when I hang on the bar to do the lower abs, I can't lift my legs as high like u. Beside I feel most of the pressure on my lower back not on my abs. PLS HELP !!!
Does anyone know what model those sweatpants are? They look sick.
bigger chest in 2 weeks?
Nice one, getting on it today. +ATHLEAN-X will you do a video how to stretch teres minor. When i try to extend completly like lat pushdown or chin-up, it hurts a lot.
Should I do this workout every day for 22 days ? Thanks
Jeff can you please do a vid about gyno
hope this will works. got only 2 pack abs for 30 days recently
thank you..!!!
Amazing Video! Really need to start training my abs
I noticed that lump on Jeffs left shoulder, I have that same injury at the moment, how do you fix it.
What if u get back neck pains??
What if u get back neck pains??
my name jeeff
My abs are my most neglected bodypart... they're so painful to train. I'm going to try this!
Jeff how long should our rest be between sets is x mans and alternate thread the needles?
Question, Jeff. What if I can do heels to the heaven for the whole day? I'm not saying I can but I can certainly do them for about 10 sets 45s each before I reach any semblance of failure. That will fatigue my abs at first exercise and ruin the rest of the workout, won't it? Is there a maximum at which you should drop an exercise and move on to the next one?
Haha Jeff finally got new shoes
Hi Jeff could you PLEASE do a video showing how to even out muscles that are bigger on one side for example left side of chest abit bigger than right side but it feels alot more chunky than the right side I've been wanting to sort this out for ages but don't know how to I've been told work only on right side but I'm not too sure on that I need some expert advice from Jeff :) ur videos are very helpful mate
I'm going to take the challenge. I'm not as fit as I'd like to be, just started cycling in and out of work again which is definitely a big step from where I was a month ago. I don't consider myself overly fat but I have this large gut that I need to work out before it gets too unmanageable, I'm hoping at least that it's not too late.
when doing these workouts, do you contract your glutes?
Awesome! Please do this for all other major muscle groups (back, chest, legs, arms) Have a great day!
Love your videos Jeff. I'm currently in your Ultimate Arms program. Could you give your input on the importance of massage in your training? I'm curious of your thoughts. Thanks!
Hey Jeff, I wanted to say thank you for being patient and humble with your videos. You have motivated me to go walking again after not working out for a while. I started a good work out regimen where I run 3 miles at 6am then take a cold shower for better recovery. Then later in the day, I am recovered and do a workout. I am now on day 4 for my rest day. Already these first 3 days have helped me tremendously. Your videos, like I said with your patience, are inspiring me to keep up and stay on this path.
I wonder how much Jeff weighs?. About 170 - 180?
I shall try this now...
so shall i repeat everything 3x? or just to once per day 1x every exercise?
To warm up, do pilates pistons.
I am seeing results from the six pack promise app. I am liking this video. thank you Jeff.
During step through planks: "pull your pants up!"
great video. Stationary bike ending set is the real deal
Is this workout to be done everyday? If so before or after usual program? Thanks
Great workout 💪🏼but what type of NIKE shoes are those Lol
Hi Jeff, could please explain why shakes happen after weight workouts? For example, one of the workouts is the dips, after 2 sets, my lower arms start to shake when I jump back on it. Is that good or bad?
Hi Jeff , I am a big time fan of you. As Ramzan (month of fasting) is gonna start from this Sunday could you please make a video as how to train during this time? possibly bodyweight workout with nutrition? I know it would be a tough one for you to make but it would be of great help if you could just help me or others who are watching . cheers.
Wish I had this 22 days ago. I did appreciate the 7 minute Ab workout.
Jeff I am gonna try this.I already do your 6 min sore abs+ vcut abs (from another guy) every day.Would be even better if I did this too?
Starting this killer today 🙌🙌🙌🙌 after an interrupted wod because of shin injury this will soothe my heart.
Thank you so mucchhhh I've been loooking for a good ab workout and was like I hope Jeff puts somethin new up soon. Coming in clutch.
Ok maybe I am not sore from yesterday *tries to stand "Was I hit by a truck or something?
hello sir..!! i am from india, i always sweat in the gym during my workout , the temperature here is quite high and it is summer warming up so do u suggest me to stop my workout in summer?
this programm is perfect to get back in shape for me :-D perfect jeff, thank you dude.
Great, i really needed  some of this ABs training TY.  Keep up the training everyone
How much rest between the different exercises?
Do it everyday? It seems so plausible in fact, for some odd reason I feel like I could work on my abs everyday but my arms need a little more rest, anybody know why this happens?
Muscle marks with legs
I wonder what Jeff thinks about Madbarz.
Jeff, I have been working out for quite some time (over a year) religiously, never skipping a day unless I'm sick. And only eating good organic food. Chicken, beef 93/7, fish, no junk food, my cheat day is a slice of dominos cheese pizza once a week. But my problem is that I can't get rid of the lower belly fat. There's just a little bit there left, but just enough to not show my gains. My top abs and obliques are shredded but I can't get that shred on my lower stomach. Any advice?
this video made my day espacily rammadan is getting closer because in this great month will help us losing weights and building muscles ..thank u jeff ☺
*JEFF I NEED HELP*  I was doing preacher curl and one of my workout partner started slaping on one of my bicep after every rep. After doing my set I noticed there are redish blueish spots on my bicep. On touchig its causing little pain. What it is? stretch mark or blood clot? What should i do? How to treat it?  Please help somebody.
Great Ab workout!!
he forgot to mentions wat days of the week or did i miss it???
I have exams for the next 22 days :(((
nice!
Excellent!!! I enjoy a lot your trainings and most of all your tips! Thank you very much!!! You rock!!!
like the pants and shoes
I didn't understand, do you have to do them everyday for 22 days, or in 1 month (30-31 days)22 of the days have to be with this workout? Cool video Jeff, keep it up!
Thanks for all the detailed  information in every video ,  Jeff you're the best on YouTube at what you do. .
Hey Jeff, could you do a video about how to get the lower part of erector spinae muscle showing
this is very good, thank you ^-^
cavaliers are 6-0 on road this postseason..
it says 22 day ab workout but in the thumbnail hes throwing up 21
Great ab workout. Definitely challenging, I love it! Thanks for sharing.    Jeff, my workout time is very limited can you give a full body workout? I guess I am very old school. But it works for me.
Thank you..can't wait to try this!!!
I usually feel a pain in my back at  the pelvic region while doing my abs workout. What can be done about it? Can anyone help me? I'll appreciate.
All reps to failure??
Hey Jeff,where do you get your trousers?Thanx man!!!
Thank You!!
I've read many times that you shouldn't work your abs every day, because they need time to recover. This 22 day challenge seems great, but contradicts that. Thoughts?
i wish jeff was my dad
surely u dont do this everyday, i did abs 3 days in row once and strained side obliques i felt it , hurt like mad, and had to give them a rest for least 4 weeks.
you are a savage
So Jeff now has his own team or something now? Look at the display strip in the background at 5:48 :D
Can you do a program for Ramadan please??
3.06 dem triceps :0
could you do tips on how to mantain muscle (or build) in ramadan?
wait is he a physician?
what if i could do the first exercise 10 times
when I did the Thread The Needle, my arm gave up and it jumped out of the joint for a second.  Hurting really bad but the pain disappeared really quick
*note to self*  1. Heels to the heaven *(45 secs)*  2. Step through plank *(45 secs)*  3. X-man crunch *(12 reps)*  4. Alternating thread the needle *(10 reps each side)*  5. Alternating Jack knives *(45 secs)*  6. Stationary Bikes *(30 secs)*
Is this once a day or twice?
2:19 his pec just popped lol
dude this was awesome can you bring something like this for chest
hang on, do i go through each excercise untill the final one you showed? or do i do them untill i faill
Jeff? Is there any rest time between exercises?
Luv u Man!
EXACTLY the WORKOUT i need !!!  Thank you as always ;)
i started at 101 kgs at 5'7", determined to shed weight. Watching u gives me a lot of motivation Jeff. I m determined to live healthy from now on.
What about the recovery needed for the abs?Please reply me..
should't i rest the abs like the othr muscles?
Thank you
Sir make video for Ramadan routine  for ur muslim fans !
I don't work abs until I lose the belly fat first.   No point in training abs when there's fat covering up.   I'll start abs after I'm thin again.
Ma nema Jeff 🤙
can you show a complete all body trx workout ? :)
jeff .. plz make a video with the markers on quads.  I wanna about vastus lateralis. .  thank u
That's a very good plan but I'm just gonna say that the "22 days builds a habit" is an urban myth
GUYYYYYS!! im on a cut phase to burn the fat ..i havent burn off most of the body fat yet but should i start doing ab workouts??? would this make my abs become visible?
i have my birthday in 22 days!!
i did this  for 22 days and i have an 8-pack right now!!! Thank you so much Jeff!!!
Jeff the type of nigga who wears puma and Nike at the same time and don't give a shit
Thanks the workout seems great! I'm going to give it a try and add this to my morning routine for at least the next 22 days :D!
No towel rows? I call bullshit.
not a bad thumbnail old timer! 👵
thanks jeff! you're such a great help!
Yo Jeff, Can you make a video about weighted abs exercises? I have this kind of trainning under time, but I'm having troubles with my lower abs and obliques
Ok starting today
Do I do this before or after daily weight training?
Anyone knows where I can find those pants
jeff i recently broke my clavicle and i realize that not everyone would benefit from a video but it is an extremely common injury so if u could give any type of rehab/range of motion tips in a video it would be much appreciated
I'm coming back to this vid comment sections to see who actualy did it.
Fantastic addition to 6pp! Thanks!
1000th cmt
Look at his serratus moving. It's easier to study gross anatomy by watch him workout than by reading a textbook.
Awesome brofessor Jeff, I have been on a pretty punishing ab routine, however this seems like it'll blow that away. Just what I've been looking for, thanks!
Thanks Jeff.. I've just started today, I will tell you in 22 days!
To get to the exercise while training type this:  3 for 45seconds 4 for 45secs 5 for 12 reps 6 for 10 reps 7 for 45 secs 8 for 30 secs
The man is a genius. Everyday fitness cracks me up but this is the guy with the knowledge...
I'm a little "chubby" atm. Will this still be good for me? Or would i need to lose weight first.
I already train abs for almost a year and I already had great results. But I will try this workout just because it's a challenge and because it's quite different than mine. See you in 22 days
I start tommorow   I need one for upper body as well!
Just in time for ab day!
This is perfect for me Jeff u the man..
Will try
jeff i have a question.Some exercises struggle even you, an athlete.How are average guys supposed to do the same exercise?
Anyone else fasting :(
I really like Core War. Just sayin'.
This is why you are the only pure fitness channel I am following. Thank you for the great content time and time again!!! DAY ONE STARTING NOW!
is it good to do same exercise daily?
I will be starting this tonight! awesome Jeff!
Jeff, I am slightly overweight... Can you do what u did with Jessie, with someone else who is slightly overweight? And ideally with no equipment... I think a lot of heavier people don't go to the gym cuz we're embarrassed... I'd really appreciate it...
maybe jeff is on test ;-)to be always lean like that
Im going to do this after ramadan
Look.. there's Jesse 1 in the background at the start, the real hard gainer .. rofl 😄 ....
I usually alternate a fullbody workout and a rest day, would this abs workout be negatively affected in it's potential if used in my normal routine as a change for abs workout if i keep the day of rest between workouts?
I have things to do like sleep and stuff, I can't just work out for 22 days straight, that's just madness.
does this help belly fat
Is this good for anterior pelvic tilt?
so i get a six pack after 22 days days?
How would you add vacuums to this workout, time or reps?
Thanks jeff ! This is great
Where u got those sweats from? I want a pair
Hey Jeff! I know that you're not a Muslim, but could you possibly make a Ramadan video, how to workout etc. and dieting, and also overall talk about this topic :-)?
Anterioir pelvic tilt fix 22days pogram, PLS PLS PLS
What I don't get is why there is no maximum. Like 4 rounds total and then to the next, since I am very sure I will be doing first exercise way more than the last ones, since my energy levels shouldn't be the same at the start of the workout to the end of the workout, therefore my lover abs will get more work in, while upper abs might get less.  Is this accurate?
could you do a video about intermittent fasting correlated to working out?
nice new Shoes
Can women use your program too??
darn this looks tough
I work with a gym junkie who bulges all over the place...  only thing is, he puffs after walking up several flights of stairs. I train martial arts and am stronger than I look.  And could run up and down those stairs for 30 mins (have done) before I'm breathing like him. (perhaps a small exaggeration)I feel indebted to Jeff for 1 tip in 1 video that has completely fixed a postural problem I've had for years.. (it was SOO simple) I subscribed immediately and started looking at his other vids.I don't want to be as big as him (In fact in one video his biceps to me look unnatural - not implying anything) but I've always wished I was more impressive.  Really tempted to try ATHLEAN-X ....  Only I'm curious whether you think I am going to lose more endurance/conditioning than I gain size?   As, at the core of most of Jeffs videos seems to be getting your muscles to turn to jello in no time at all. A UFC round is no longer than 5 minutes and UFC championship Fights can go 5 rounds. I'm no UFC fighter but getting Huge and not being able to 'play' for long doesn't sound like an end goal I'm interested in.
plus cardio??? or nah
Jeff can you do a stephen-amell breakdown video similiar to that of  Zac Effron?
Once I'm done with 1 exercise so I rest or do i straight start doing the next exercise ?
hey Jeff can you make a video for those of us fasting for Ramadan
nice Technic thanq sir
I don't get it, if you go to failure from the very first exercise, how are you supposed to ever get a decent amount of work from the following exercises? And this goes for every level, say i'm a beginner, i'm going to die 20s in, but same if i am a super advanced athlete,  i will probably get >2 sets of heels to the heaven, but then i don't have enough fuel to even get near the extinction target for the other exercises.....So will i be doing 99% heels to the heaven every day?
This seems brutal! Trying it today
god someone watch the ads, he can't even afford a shirt
Awesome abs workout
don't forget to eat in the full range of motion
Jeff you're awesome
So gonna try this. Starting tomorrow at the gym!!
I'd love to see a video centered around training for sprinters
How can I get a full program designed for my body ?
LOVE THIS!!
heels to the heaven is hard on a wooden floor because I really feel the pressure on the middle-ish joints of my spine when I get to the top and I have nothing but wooden floors.
awesome workout can't wait to do this
How about a 3 round limit for each exercise before you move on to the next one? So the "oh, I can do heels to the heaven for hours" will shut up.
We all know nothing is natural about his muscle mass...
Hi, i've a question ! How to prevent elbow bursitis inflammation ? ....
Great workout Jeff! I will be trying this out, thanks!
Jeff that's so great. Thank you so much for this video. I'm definitely going to incorporate that into my workout.  Can you maybe make a video about push pull legs? I mean like a general introduction and overview and differences to the bro split :)
Jeff look beast man
i hv been using ur 6 minutes ab app for the last 2 weeks, so which is effective that one and this.
Day 1... one set each... burn like hell!!!!!!!!!!
Jeff I am confused becuz I feel very rusty in morning sprinting workout plz tell me what to eat or drink before morning sprinting workout
I'm gonna write this down and try it.
This man has the best fitness channel on YouTube
awesome  hey Jeff could you do a  warm up video? Something that covers warming up to get your whole body ready to train?
Hey Jeff great vid, could you also make a video like this for other muscles like chest, arm, etc... Thanks
Jeff I'm sam.....I'm a skinny gym.......I'm doing your abs workouts .........but most of the people are saying that "if a skinny guy build six packs he can't build other body muscles" .......it's right or not .......I'm a skinny guy can I do abs workouts ??
NBA news at 5:40
Thumb up if you think there is a desperate need for a "best of Jesse" compilation.  Also possibly a best Jeff phrases compilation.
36 fatties dont like this.. they are like: " this is useless he didnt eat something ".
oh you better believe I'm ready to do this!!! Free work out I'll take it
hey Jeff some of the exercises you suggested are not possible for people with hip flexor problems and anterior pelvic tilts (like myself), can you show us some alternatives to those?
oh thats really cool  my lower back is way stronger than my abs and i want them to get more balanced so this seems perfect
Jeff could you please do a video on the plantaris muscle? I've injured it and it totally sucks
I Love everything your doing keep it up I'm starting my 22 days tomorrow. thank you for being awesome!!
Holy shit, Jeff! You are so ripped this year!
I'd love a diet and supplements video please Jeff
Jeff needs to eat more..js
●Heels to the heavens-> 45 seconds ●Step through planks-> 45 seconds ●"X" Man Crunch-> 12 Reps ●Alternating thread the needle-> 10 reps to each side ●Alternating Jackknifes-> 45 seconds  ●Stationary Bikes-> 30 seconds
Jeff,  if you do this for the 22 days and eat right too  will I realy see something?  my abs are faint but if I push real hard you see them LOOOL
this was very help full thanks, like honestly thank you
Hey my washer broke, can I use your stomach?
How much rest should we take between exercises? I never heard him mention that
can we upload pic of day 1 and day 22 after following all of them properly.
.see u in 22nd day jeff😎
no rest? But I thought rest is essential for muscle growth?
So your doing max of these exercises?
Feels like this workout only would be good for someone in singe digit bodyfat, am I wrong?
thanks a lot jeff....ur unique excersize is helping me a lot
thanks jeff am gonna try it out
I'll tell you guys all about it 22 days from now!
Guys what do you have to do with the exercises with reps ( no time). Do you have to increase the volume or just do the same amount of reps
hats off epic workout,gonna try this straight from tomorrow
this was exactly what I needed 😀
Jeff is the reason people back at my gym thinks I'm a weirdo doing weird stuff there.
I'am in
How do you get so lean??... and stay so lean?... 👍
Can these exercises be done before going to Golden Corral?
What body fat % do i need for abs to show?
Make a video on how to not jack off
HAI ma niem ez jaiff
Thank you Sir, I am 58 yrs. Greatly motivated & already following you since the last few weeks. It's working. You are doing  a great job for people like me. God bless you.
Ramadan is around the corner. Im gonna be losing some weight and do this ab workout. It's gonna be awesome
in better shape than earlier this year.. awesome brother!!
great job jeff!!👍👍👍
yes finally an actually work out that is meant for abs and WORKS
Thx you so much
thx jeff
if i do this every day, can is still train like i used to do for the rest of my body?
gonna take up this challenge for the 22 days
ok then. let's do this
Never clicked on a vid so fast
this is so dope, sharing it with everybody i know. wish I had seen it before I started training this morning. I'm GAME, I'll be only 1 day behind.
Jeff , should the recovery time between those exercises be like 30-60 seconds, or is there only that 10s
is this work out for losing belly fat?
who the fuck subs to a channel, watch a vid that is so well made and so informative and hits the disslike button ?!?!?! How can this vid has any disslikes @_@ even how can Jeffs all vids have any ..... hi gives so much proper info I just dont get how stupid some ppl may be ?!?!?
love Abb work outs, and I'm game on ;)
My problem is when I do any lying exercise my back rounds. Any advice on that?
I think this is a great way to work ABS.
Just in time for Ramadan
Can I wear gloves when I do this workout?
Starting on this challenge today. I would truly appreciate it if you did this for legs and chest as well. If it already exists, someone, please link it in the comments. Also, what is the best way to increase forearm size?   Thank you.
i will post my results in 22 days 👍 let's see if it works better than other abs workouts, my lower abs are not visible yet
Eating chips while watching this.
Awesome. Just worried about some with lower back pain/APT?
Every day... In a row... I'm going to be sore as shit tomorrow and I'm going to power through. I'll keep powering through maybe a week until I start feeling not only that I'm dying but that I'm glad to be dying. Then I'm going to go to Carls Jr and buy myself a recovery meal that'll make my hair fat.
THE BEST!
you look fkn jacked in this video😐😑
abs forgive me for the next 22 days💀
Jeff, I like the new shoes
Jeff could you please do a video on pectus carinatum?
The sock Abs are my favorite I'll stick with them Instead.

Nice new shoes Jeff ;)

I have never been able sit through any exercise guru's shit for 30 seconds until I came across this jacked nutter. Best on Youtube.
Nice work.. You must be sponsored bye Puma @ Nilke !
I am a simple man, Jeff uploads a video, I watch it
jeff you need to make a muscle marker tee shirt...plz
How many times a week do i do these exercises?
Man if you could somehow incorporate the extinction technique with 6 pack promise, I think all problems in the world would be solved and all wars would end forever.
this video is going to my favorites :D
Just when I'm slacking on abs Jeff comes with this video
Can I do this in the morning and lift later like at 6pm!
Jeff is so ripped his abs have abs
Notice me senpai
Will definitely give this a try :)
Jeff I have a inguinal  hernia  is it ok to do your abs workout ?
This will be a game changer. Thanks.
I was looking for some good Abs workout and u presented this awesome video...Thanks :)
So we need to do all these exercises everyday for 22 days? Thanks for this content
Hi Jeff, Can we build a lean and clean chest by just doing bodyweight exercises? P.S Thank you very much for such a great abs workout plan. Definitely starting it today.
must try
ima try this
This nigga flexing every single muscle in every single thumbnail it's hella stupid
thnx man! i have a question; i live in very high altitude, (tibet kind of high) what would be your suggestion to build up muscle having less oxygen in the air?
What if i get soreness?
He has has ab veins now
sir please talk about l arginine
Newbie here... how are abs somehow different than other muscles? Because I've read over and over that you shouldn't keep hitting the same group day after day, and, in fact, it could inhibit growth. Thanks
Thank you, Jeff!
Alright Jeff I'm down for it! see you in 22 days!
22days straight oh my abs
Great vid. Jumping on this in the morning. Cheers.
great video
I've been doing your 7 minute ab workout everyday for the last 6 weeks. I think this will be a nice switch.
JEFF what the heck is going on with Scott Steiner's pectoral recession!?!?!?!?!?!
thank you
dislikers just wanna be shout out in the comment section.....
I'm bored of doing the same old workouts could you show some cool alterations
2:35 Well my abs are R.I.P.ed then :'-)
Wait. Are we supposed to do ALL of these exercises every single day? o.O how can you keep going with the other exercises once you reach Xtinction on one of them?
I thought this was in dedication to the 22 that died in Manchester at the Ariana concert. Guess I'll just have to dedicate 22 pounds of ab muscle.
Ohh, can't wait to try this out. I love ab challenges :D
thank jesus for no equipment
Great content just wanna let you know they have some great microphones that plug into camera so you don't have to wear it.
alright! good stuff
those puma pants look ready to rock😲😲😲
Jeff is a god 🙏🙌
"Nothing worth it should come easy." Damn, thats a good print on a T-shirt
ill see wat goes down in 22 days starting 05-26-2017
Guys is it true that you shouldn't do abs on back day ??
Is there a good substitute for exercise two? I just don't have the flexibility yet to get my hips around to properly activate my abs.
Thanks for the share Jeff.  I'm already trying to do your 7 minute ab workout video.
Do this while sippin cough syrup, call it athLEAN
shouldnt you not work same body part everyday
Illuminati 22
i have a gut that is huge, is this gonna help me!
Jeff, please make a video on fullbody warmup for athletes. Thank you.
im postponing my 6 pack promise routine tomorrow for this
You are awsum- respect
Thanks for a great site, we even use your knowledge in our gyms in Thailand! Question: I've been training abs for years and made sure to hit all areas in a controlled matter - my issue lie more in the diet. My belly fat is the laaast to leave, so when I go on a Cal def, I loose pump and size all around the body just to get that little fat of my belly to see the abs. Basically, I feel I need to choose abs or body. Got low body fat all around, just that damn stomach. 186cm/ 90kg and around 15-17 %
I caught myself half assing a workout this morning 😢 sorry jeff lol
Jeff do I take a 10 sec rest between rep exercises (i'm assuming yes)  thanks ! Will try tomorrow , looks Great
i believe you can coach someone to become a new Arnold..
Abs r by far my most hated for me every exercise is so awkward and mkre than abs hurt lol
Where is the ab exercise for serratus???
somebody give this man a beer
Black Magic
Jeff looks fucking incredible! Ideal.
Thinklikemo . Let's goo . Follow your dreams and don't give up
Hey Jeff, are you a Cleveland fan?
I'm in, wish me luck
Rhomboids Muscle activation and non Responders.. plz jeff🙏💪
can i do this everyday and still get optimal results? if not how much should i train with this workout?
Jeff can you give some information about fitness for teens especially at 14 years old. im 14 and need help. Can you cover like nutrition and is it okay to cut back(caloric deficit), intermittent fasting or anything like that healthy? Fat burning tips. Basically tips and ifnormation for teens trying to get results(14 years old info) Thanks Keep Up The great vids
your TRX anchor is set up way too low.
you forgot, it's VACUUM TIME GOD DAMNIT!  How can you forget about VACUUMS?  right babe?
Thank you Jeff for taking the time to show your great content. The 22 day challenge is on!
What's your body fat Jeff?
could u make vids like this for all the general bodyparts of the body
Starting tomorrow
15 people disliked ...guess they can only do it in 21 days and quit
If someone who actually knows what they're talking about could help me with a question I would greatly appreciate it. If I am doing doing different muscle groups every day is it okay for me to train 7 days a week or should I take a day off to help repair better?
thank you
this is the best youtube fitness channel ever
hey Jeff I've been watching your videos for a while now and I was wondering if you could make a video or give me some exercises to do for bicep calisthenics exercises
Jeff you're amazing man. Your videos are so exhaustive yet to the point. Love what you're doing. Keep it up and help us train like athletes.
I have a little bit of lower belly fat should I lose that first before trying this?
challenge accepted
You know what, no more excuses. I'm actually going to try this. The next 22 days I will dedicate to this workout!
How much do you rest between each exercise? I did not catch that part.
last time I was this early , I saw Monica Lewinsky giving ted talk
can you make a video on upper body workout with a broken hand?
Can I do this if I have a herniated disk?
I was just wanting a good ab workout that I can do on a regular basis. WHAT IS THIS SORCERY?!?!
Let's get it!🔥🔥🔥
Nice!! I made recently also a good abs workout video💪🏼😄
Fuck yea!! I'm starting this tmrw!!
Just what i needed! Thanks Jeff, perfect timing!
Can you do a chest version of this too?
Ez
From the bottom of my heart, Thank you jeff!
Boo yah starting this tomorrow!! My abs are already rock hard using the Trinity 3 and the 300 rep routines. Thanks Jeff!!
can u do a video on conor mcgregor and his workout
jeff how do u manage to maintain that kind of body with gear at this age? happy if replied
thank you so much sir! you are really very helpful with workouts
you're the Best!!!!
love you!
I accept this challenge
I get stomach cramps when I do ab workouts. Do you have any suggestions on how to cope with this?
Just curious but how many years has Jeff been working out for?
Anyone know if I can do this with pulled lower back? Or bulging disc?
I got an artificial lower back disc. You guys think this workout is ok for that?
Cool choker necklace bro.
Jeff I'm quite curious if you get a pump before every video you do because it looks like you're jacked every video..or do you just look that good walking around (honest question)
all those everyday for 22 days huh ?
Excellent video it was shot perfectly showing the exercises clearly...thank you!
Challenge accepted.
i already have abs but i have protected them under my belly fat 😁
The level of knowledge that you have, Jeff, is truly astounding.  Thanks for all of the great content.  I have incorporated a lot of the small, technical items into my training and it is phenomenal (but also daunting as to how much esoteric science there is to all of this).  Thanks for your time and talent.
What are some suggestions to replace the "thread the needle" movement for people like myself with repaired shoulders?
Thanks for the video and thanks for inspiring people like me to want to become better and never quit
I had started the 8-week-long abs workout from the app but from the 3rd week it started giving exercises that required equipments which I don't have. This, on the other hand, might just work. Thanks, Jeff. You came through without me asking for it.
I love this fucking channel
That's a fuckin crazy method. I'm in.
I'm gonna do this but I have a feeling I'm not gonna make it through the end.
When Jeff says "good luck"...
nice video
Awesome. Thanks, Jeff!!
day 1 of 22
The modt important point is the 22 days at the Beginning!!!
Hey Jeff, I'm a 20 year old PTA student and I work out  everyday except weekends. My  question is that I  have lower body fat even though I have a clean diet and also my pectoralis minor isint coming in even though I work it. The problem is that I don't  use any supements; could this be my problem?
my legs feel more sore than my abs
can you also pls make video for diastasis recti?
and dont forget to stretch your abs also train your back muscles so that you wont get any muscle imbalances.
Can you do this a series targeting other parts of the body?
THE MOST CONFIDENT GUY ON THE INTERNET PERIOD!
starting this tomorrow
yo !  I am an obece biginner going back to the gym today after weeks . and takeing you have this challenge you shall be seeing my comments here everyday with my updates and on the 22nd day my tweet will reach you when I complete it how about that ?
Jeff you could have made it simpler.  Instead of 45 seconds why not a number of reps, that way we don't need a countdown clock nearby.   We just count!   Why seconds instead of # of reps?
Tonight I was prepping for travel and then what do I see? Jeff uploading a video with a crazy title just in time for summer.
Why 22 day?
I am currently taking bet's that Jeff looks in the mirror 280 times a day that's once every 2 minutes over a 14 hour day.. the odds a 5 to 1 ...                 Do I have any takers people??
took me one day to develop a drinking habit.. i heart beer.
Jeff what about giving the abs time to heal ?
Chak!
I've been doing your ab app for a few months now.  It works!  I was 245 pounds on January 3rd 2017 and with eating right and exercising I am now 180 and have a lot of ab definition.  I will be trying this as well. Thanks
Why no rest days? Don't they need time to recover?
one of best ab routines I've come through.
been doing the six abs promise, and now there's another video again? which one should we do?
due to back issues, my back ache/hurt faster than my abs itself. lol. any1 facing this issues too?
Just do crunches shit.
i am tired Of evrything,just Tell Me how To got a Body Like jeff
i'm eager to try this, but I've always been told that working out a certain  muscle everyday can be counterproductive because you need to give them time to rest. however, I trust jeff with almost everything fitness-related...can anyone give me some insight into this?
is it nesecery to work out while keeping fast or what will happen if don't
Excellent work! My respect to you sir.
I'm at that awkward stage where I have a low body fat, but I don't do nearly enough ab work. Here's hoping this sends me in the right direction.
If you haven't already done so could you cover how to balance your training.  I spent years focusing some muscles and ignoring others.  How should someone in that position handle the muscles that were ignored and should I dial back my efforts on those I used to focus on?  the goal is a well balanced physique.
any1 know how to remove lower body fat i mean like thigh and ass? fuckin 12%bf are at my ass and leg i mean wtf
how does that skinny guy at the beginning, standing like that
I'll definitely do this workout.  You did it again Jeff!  You amaze me.
I like IT ,,,wait did you really like my comment ?!
Great video.
Jeff, you are an idiot this man is put video for us to change our body and mind set. and you talking that much crap
So wait, should you train abs like this every day? I thought you needed to have a rest day in between ab workouts. Which is it?
I'm definitely trying this
No thanks
Poor Randy the skeleton in the background.  He looks so depressed.  You should have him standing up straight and healthy with a sign to join your network and to buy AX-1!!
A leg version next???
Implementing this!
nice video bro
nice video bro
nice video man
nice video man
Just did it. I have abs.
Well better get started, I'll come back here after 22 days
Like for a "Jeff is the type of guy" video
I just did abs today...
can you get my wife pregnant?
Hi Jeff..I have been following six pack promis for more than half a year now.. but I still can't go through all the exercises (shuffled) on max (and above difficulty) without taking multiple rests. Just to be sure I do watch my form very carefully, but they are indeed very challening
thanks
Is it possible to overtrain ab muscles because I feel like doing this every day for 22 days would do it
Jeff the type of guy to rob a bank using his "guns" *ba dum tss*
Fantastic. Thank you!
Love this, going to give this a go
I just got up and saw this. Thanks Jeff, getting to it right away.
thank you!!! I have been waiting for a video like this that gives me spacific reps a set time and the exercises. you should really do a video like this with upper body and lower body as well please.
12,000 views in 27 minutes
someday someone will find this comment  😐
I swear Jeff's videos come on the right time
Do you know some exercises that can help me with boxing? My coaches are old school and our strength and conditioning techniques feel antiquated
the guy in the back looks like he went to extinction
I'm doing this, thanks jeff
can you talk about handstands/ yoga and stability training
im excited..lets go..22 days.i got this
It is funny how I was just thinking of doing another ab workout tomorrow rather than just today and Jeff uploads it
it's day 5 of Ax-1 today and I am soo sore can barely walk. help 😭
what other muscle groups is this "extinction" style training effective for
But but but I want abs with out and exercise 🤓
Crazy how long Jeff has been around yet he still comes out with cool and new content
Awesome. Gonna do all 6 exercises in my gym today.
I love your channel I think you're fantastic however correct me if I'm wrong you were a skinny guy most your life until you put on muscle what do fat dice do? this is an issue
can u do a 22 day chest workout
My name is Jeff
I contract my abdominals as much as I can and try to avoid hip flexion but my hips always seem to like "crack". This happen with any laying leg raise variation and i don't know how to fix it. It feels like the cartilage in my hips are grinding together
do a 22 day chest workout
I thought muscles shouldn't be worked out more than every other day so they have a chance to rebuild.
1k likes. And 4 dislikes. Holy fuck
Jeff, because of this video I am no longer a 5%er. You have converted me from the lightweight 8 hour workout to the 22 day workout
awesome real science
My abs hurt just watching this
awwww yeah
I only do one ab exercise, sit ups with a heavy dumbbell on my chest and my obliques got bigger without training them directly
Does this for 22 days the same work out?
Question. What is the recourse for when we get to the point where we can't workout without doing damage? Do we skip a day or do something?
Damn Jeff!! Just when I thought you couldn't give us a more challenging workout. We get hell on earth ab exercise lol 😂
Jeff you should review "impossible abs" app for Android.  I think it actually works
Gonna try it. I'll make sure to say the results in 22 days.
Jeff the type of guy who loves "Jeff the type of guy" comments.
this is crazy!!!
Challenge Accepted!
fuck im gonna spend an hour with this workout.
doesn't anyone else feel discouraged when they do ab exercises??? cuz I do
do you think I should still do this program even if I worked out that day already?
Homecooked chili is really high protein and low calorie as long as you don't sweeten it or add corn starch. just new mexico chile, onions, el pato tomatoes, and every bean under the sun
I think the mets need you now Jeff.
this guy is the best
Sweet video Jeff!! Thanks
Jeff when you gonna start uploading in 1080p?

All I do is planks for my Abs but I could totally use some more tips
I wish Jeff was my personal trainer
Jeff could you do a general warm up video? Something that covers both mobility and generally warming up to get your whole body ready to train?
My Abs are harder than yours. I'm just Saiyan.
firstt
I really really loved all your videos. You the man 💪💪👍👍
