Safty glasses
This man is what every Indonesians dream of
Really hope he keeps his eyes, even a master tradesmen can make a mistake.
Are those boards that are the in-line stays in between the corners and what kind of wood is that? I noticed they are stapled with no insulators
You sick at angles a
a 9 wire fence wow!?  Is that common in NZ?  Here in Idaho USA most people do 4 or  wire.
Great video. I am looking to build a sheep fence. I would like to see more detail on how you build a 90 degree corner. Are you still using the floating brace method or H brace?
Good to see a gun fencer hard hill country fencer. They hard gentlemen ti find now.
What was the purpose of this video?
What great tip?
Chur the brother tegs
Absolutely briliant skills
What is the name of the tool(s) used?
Never seen a full bull wire fence before. Here in Northern Ireland it's sheep wire with 1 strain of barb below and 2 or 3 strains above then the ole boys with only cattle and does their own fencing works with only barb wire but this is rare now. Only time bull wire is used as a support wire twisted between the strainer and it's support post or as a bottom strain under the sheep wire. Love this kind of work
www. ktwister.com    thanks
To fast for my eyes.
That was sick 👌
what is the height of this fencing
Very nice, did not wear pretty fast so I will have to watch it really really slow. Beautiful not though
Definitely not the best
Very professional well done it goes to show that practice makes perfect.
Great filming of his forearm
He's fast. So fast I couldn't even see how he did the bloody knot
Gosh, You’re great at this!  I’m so frustrated and when I look at this, you make me feel terrible!  It reminds me of how I suture up a wound!  You know knots so well, and just rip them off like I do!  But I just cannot work the high tensile wire like you do!  It breaks for me, when I don’t want it to!  You seem to be able to command it like a total pro!  Which you certainly ARE!  I sure wish I could find someone like you to help me!  I like to do things on my hobby farm, myself!  I cannot find anyone to help that knows what to do!  Maybe I should move to Australia! I’m so frustrated and need help!
yes a good knot but id say id crimp it faster
You have the wire on the wrong side of the posts. Assuming that your position @12:41 is the side the animals will be located.
How can I order it moreover I’m from meddle east region special from Saudi Arabia?
Should definitely be wearing safety glasses when handling wire. One could easily flick up and hit you.
If anyone is wondering what gear he uses.. strainright nz
Lovin al those Hayes pullers, don't know what they cost there but on the other side of the world, Canada, they cost $200 each, at a time where gas us about $1.50 per later and a pack a smokes is about $13.00, just for comparison, in my opinion they are the best pullers out there but a little pricey in my part of the world
What type of fence is stronger and more useful, this type of fence that shows the video or other such as tite grip or xfence?
According to your experience, what is the best fence system? This one that is shown in the video or netting fence like tite grip?
a master craftsman!
Never going to complain about my ground again!
obviously an amateur camera man but would have been good if he focused on the knot tying rather than the blokes face. shame.
It just needs some 240V pulses in it !
Camera man sucks
I watched your videos years ago and thanks to you I have been impressing peaple and supporting my family ever since.many thanks .
Ok I see... awesome.
How his doing the last cut  ?
nice quad
More info on blasting a post hole please!!! Farmers/Fencers can't get access to dynamite here in Australia anymore :(
Wear EYE PROTECTION !!
I am fencing maker here in Mexico, but I would like to see him with barb wire. Interested
when you hear "slowly" that's the time to speed up folks!
Good idea
How does this man cut / break the wire while twisting it to the other wire?
Kg is that Kg*Earth Gravitational Constant?
Good enough knot but that corner brace is a joke it will push that post out of the ground
Otokostation1 I would love to get in touch privately, do you have an email? By the way not spam, I am from NSW, Australia 👍🏼
wonderful
What is this fence for?  Was thinking about using some sturdy galvanized steel cable (3 strands) for horse fencing.  Sound reasonable?
Yea, this guy really knows his stuff, but as far as any instruction, this video sucks.
Best fencing unit should possess blunt barbs in a rhombus.
Thanks for the vid. Much appreciated...
How many hectares is this station?
That type of fencing is hard on horses. It can cut them up pretty good.
Thanks for the tips.
hi what is that knot called its a beauty
This video is very interesting and useful. we also provide FENCING service in Newport. for more details visit > https://plus.google.com/b/103882488716898581040
A fantastic video. Great location . No noise except Allen  the Frenchman and pinging wires. Very Inspirational.  thanks  for sharing.
With this sort of fencing without barbs the stock dont not damage their hide so you get more money for the hides free of cuts.
The wire strainers  are called Hayes and are made in New Zealand only I believe. Readly available in Australia and plenty of info on the net for those interested. You are not getting mine.
What brand wire strainers?
I am putting up wire fences for my goats and I used this knot. Loved it!
I like that knot !
Aluminum wire? Looks like not hard steel wire cause bent easy?
1500mm deep? that's one solid strainer. Got to agree with your comment on Strainrite monkeys, always use them myself, never let me down. One thing I've stopped doing is nailing staples dead onto wire due to galvanised coating damage, too many weak points being created.
Can you show us how you handle gates? I love the tips.
we dont have that kind of wire
The Restraint of Beasts innit
What's the name of the contractor doing the work?
to fast couldn't make out what he doin
is that cheaper than barbed wire?  that's not how we build fence, but looks like you know your stuff.  is that hot wire? dont see any insulators. will that hold cattle?
I love fixing fences
This guy is a true fencing master he's what all of us American fence builders aspire to be he's forgotten more than we know keep up the great work
No PPE whatsoever.  Pass.
I realy liked the  video but I didn,t here the two company names who make those chain strainers.  I don't think they are available in the USA.  How can I get some?
how do u mean putting a foot on strainers I know end an corner strainers can be a bugger for poppin be interestin to see a video or u doin it
Good fencer but the camera man has NO IDEA, we all wanted to see the knot, but all we got was a close up of his head, what a waste of video, DUMMY !!!
why dont you use a bob wire???
A lot of work when you just could have got some field fence.
the wire streches in time noe in a few years when its streched you cant fix it without adding wre. just put a winder on
to get even tention fron both ends you have to pull it in the middle not a corner
lol how would he know how much tention the wire is under. ball head
Don't chuck your wire off cuts on the ground. Have a wire bucket.
Great video, awesome tips. I thoroughly enjoy watching a master work. I am fixing to build a fence for goats and was looking at the woven wire fencing with predator control. I really like the look of this fence and this high tensile smooth wire stuff is new to me. How effective would this fence be at containing goats, and keeping out predators? I have relatively flat ground much flatter than what your dealing with. To contain goats what would be a good post spacing and the spacing of battens between post. Again thanks for posting such a great video.
Good job, just tried it out on a fence at home, Thanks... and its an easy knot/joint!
Bist finceng tups wuth Ellan Smuth
My tip to you...Wear saftey glasses when working with wire!!
Hola estoy trabajando en cercos para mi terreno y los tensores que usas no los encuentro en Chile, me puedes decir que nombre le dan en tu país y si conoces una tienda online de confianza que los tenga para ver si puedo comprarlos, gracias
After seeing your vid I used the 'Taihape knot' all last week helping a mate maintain some fencing, I'm new to fencing but I picked it up pretty quickly. My mate's been farming for over twenty years and now uses the 'Taihape knot' too. Thank you for sharing it was a great help.
It's great seeing a learnt skill in action. Amazing :-)
This is not swordfighting at all!
Hey, thanks.  I thoroughly enjoyed these videos and wish you would put some more up.  What spacing do you use for your 9 strands?
Its really good i wish you can come to do my fence garden for my roses, thank you.
non electric ,fucking joke back to the 1920s cattle will wreck it
half round posts so crap should be band
safety glasses or just be super carful
What did you use? I dont think its a tex brown which is what I use but this looks way quicker
thanks karen, i normally use a cheap pair but buy top cutters  (knipex)
hi, what make is your fencing pliers.
BRAVO   ! ! ! ! !
Good video boys. Respect from an Irish farmer
is it a Bekaert wire?
What tip? Where is the tip? wtf
good vids
This is how I do mine. Showed to me by Neville Prince from Waratah
I am the person in front of the camera. The wire we use is high tensile and has a breaking strain of 700kg. When you twist it across the grain it will snap off much like the branch of a tree.
I don't use any tools to cut the wire. I have a technique for breaking the wire that leaves absolutely no sharp edges much the same as a farrier twisting off horse shoe nails with his hammer. Watch the video closely and you will see how this is done. Good luck
Cost of this fence is between $15-$20 per metre NZD. I use spades, post hole borers and post drivers to put posts in the ground. I build my own spades as I havn't yet seen a decent build commercial spade.
This particular fence was built with 2.5mm high tensile wire which is commonplace in NZ though 3.15mm HT is becoming popular. Before this all the fences were built with 4mm (No8) mild steel wire which is good stuff but it needs to be pre stretched and it does lose its tension over time whereas the HT wire holds its tension for ever providing the fence is built properly. The posts are 600-700mm in the ground and the strainers are 1500mm in the ground.
Sell the dog. I have just been through this with my brother and he opted for a wood fence for his dog rather than wire as it worked out cheaper. I'm not suggesting this is always the case you will have to do the homework. I would go for wire mesh as bored dogs love chewing wood. Nothing money can't fix.
Thanks, came across this video as I'm going to need to do some fencing soon.  Very informative for me.
Are you cutting/knicking the wire ends or do they just break off by themself from work hardening?
Awesome - good work...
figure 8
Very little tips here. Try again gentleman.
He's in the north island
Is a good video with close ups and clarity. Fencing is a difficult task installing as well as removal and making it easier is in every ones best interest.
what thickness wire are you using
i can vouch for the fact netting is harder to put up on undulating land we dont have many easy going flat jobs
These videos have been a great help, thank you. Your workmanship is something to aspire to!
great videos nice  to see  a skilled fencer at work and one that takes pride in there work is that a tex brown knot  your using to  join the wires ? would it work on 3.15mm high tensile  line wires ?
Yes, uphill, downhill and round corners is a real problem with netting.  We solved that problem with the Fence Wire Tensioning Tool.  Really worth a look - see our video on Youtube and visit the dedicated website.
It is one of the harder  works  ,  today  there are a lot of new machines so fieldwork become easyer  ,keepon being a hard work anyway when you have to dig among rocks. Good job.
I love the blasting idea, I think I want to find out what it takes to get licensed.  I have a post driver with a pilot driver, but when you do get through rock the posts that are larger then the pilot hole still break.  What are you using to make the hole for blasting? What are you using for blasting?  Here in the US federal law doesn't require a license for binaries as long as you use them where you mix them, allows farmers to use ammonium nitrate for stumps.  State law can be more restrictive.
great workmanship there , love the figure 8 knot ,and the attention put in to the straining post. Tools are razor sharp.have a look at the shavings coming from the saw :D
@cyberprop  Plain wire and batten fence better suits the undulating land that we have in most of rural New Zealand. It is far easier to deal with in challenging conditions and is a lot cheaper per length. On the right terrain netting is ideal and quick and easy to erect but can be a nightmare to tighten when you have to go over hills and through hollows. We don't use a lot of barbed wire in this country anymore. We prefer to use either more wires or use electric wires.
what are the advantages of the plain wire over using say sheep netting and barb or plain wire? we mainly do 8/80/15 and 2 barbed wire strands. id love to be able to blast holes like that :)
good video this will be better in French because I have not quite understood is that this fence is electrified? you do not use barbed wire?
Cheers mate. This was one of the more challenging lines I've done and I've been doing it twenty years. Ironically it is on my own farm. If it was for someone else I might have had second thoughts.  Do you want to come and help me batten it? Only seven hundred metres to go.
thats how u make A HOLE  for a post i wish  that was leagal here in the uk
