Oh my goodness. 12 years ago. Yes YT, I did want to see this today.
Thank you for this tutorial is there any way it can be made thicker than shown on the video?
Who’s watching this in 2020? :)
Wheres the philipines tho?
Yooooo im so late!
2020! Hahaha thanks girls!
It's beautiful.  My son has been all over the world.  He'd love it.
2020
This video is foreshadowing “That Cost How Muuuuch?” series. 😱
If you don't want to build your own cork map you can buy it here https://cork-shop.co.uk/product/cork-boards/corkboard-world-map/
Sorry but you talk a lot like really a lot
Philippines where!
2019, anyone???
2019, anyone?
Watching this in 2019!
this is the original "that cost how much??"
I clicked on it not realising how old it was.. Jesus Christ, they’ve grown up!
I am a huge fan of you guys, ever since the beginning, but this video just popped up on my Youtube and oh my God the changes! In style, looks, how you guys talk. It is awesome to see the improvement.  Lots of love from Hungary! ❤😚
They look so different omgoodness!!!😭😭🖤
They forgot Tasmania from Australia
Becky Looks So Uncomfortable 😣
You can also find a roll of cork that works for this at Michael's with the woodworking stuff.
BECKY YOU'RE SO YOUNG! awww
omg why did this show up in my recommended?? this is so old they're little baby youtubers!!
Baby sorry girls!!!
Omg I started watching y’all in 2017 and y’all look like babies in this video. Love it. Keep up the great work ladies.
You guys should redo some old diys
They’ve gotten SO much better at making videos. 😂
"tell 'em becky"  that was so cute i am in love
I feel stupider having watched this.
Great idea. Good job on it, too.
On that cork paper you could stick it on foam board but what ever lol
Omg you Guy’s are so young here ahahaha
Good New Zealand is there phew 😅
Hi! Great video, thanks! You inspired me so I wanted to do my own corkboard world map. It took me not 3 hours but 3 days (!) to cut cork, but final effect was worth the effort Corkboard map looks great!
Woah 2013...I think I’m a little late...
I really like this video but maybe not a talking intro..could be way shorter
I am watching this in 2018 haha
This is scary, they’re so scary and quiet, Becky looks scared 😂
Omg!! Can't believe how far you guys have gone!!
Where the fuck is Sicily guys
this is so cute. they were so nervous back then
They were so awkward back then. If you look at there newer videos they are sooo more confident and better
OMG YOU WERE SO CUTE
Omg you guys were so adorable 😆
OMG! Love this, thank you!!
lol rip tasmania
they reduced my country's big islands, Indonesia has 5 big islands not 3...
Im so scared of becky in this video
Very awkward video but the idea is really cool
Baby sorry girls 😍😍
You guys are definitely less awkward in front of the camera than now
Kelsey looks like a nun
You guys seem so different now! It's so crazy! <3 <3
I really like your before and latest videos... But I like the latest videos better because your so carefree when you talk..
I totally feel like I just saw this uploaded like a week ago wtf not 3 years
t h e    m u s i c
You both look really sad
love your vids
where is Sardinia giiiiirls😭😭
I'm sad you guys didn't do Philippines... But I get it.. Too many islands...
omg cutiessss
omg they look like babies
becky looks like she wants to cry for like the entire video. But this turned out really good <3 LOVE FROM MICHIGAN!!!
if you forget where to put everything and can't figure it out, you can just make pangaea
you guys look so awkward in this video haha, it's amazing to see how far you guys have come
Thanks for the website suggestion, I've printed out a poster and I'm going to make it using newspaper in the school holidays (2 weeks)
I love watching older Sorry Girls videos - you guys have come so far! Thank you for all of the fantastic tutorials and for constantly trying to up your game. :D You ladies are awesome!
They added Dominican Republic but not Puerto Rico, kinda sad
Are you guys ok you look so depressed or just out of it
This is so weird! You guys look like babies here! -2017
sulawesi mana deh wkwk
I love you guys! You make amazing diys that inspires me:)
That's such a cute idea
awesome diy im so going to do this. you guys have grown so much #sorry girls
I was binge watching your videos and this video popped up in my recommended. ohmygod fetus TheSorryGirls! you guys have truly came a loooonggg way. so proud ❤
Hi, girls! I'm brazilian. Your videos are amazing ❤
Is anyone watching this in 2017?! Haha I am!
love this
bitch please, where ya Philippines at?
Where do they sell it? She says it in 0:32 but I cannot understand. Can anyone please translate? :)
why she look like she about to cry the whole time
Love this idea, but I have one problem, on Australia you forgot something more like someone, TASMANIA! Why does everyone forget about us?
the corkboard it so hard to cut
Becky's hair tho
Nice Simple Vid... Like the energy
...they cut out an entire world..!!
TASMANIA WHERE U AT??
Holy crap, thank you. This is the best tutorial on youtube about a corkboard world map
this is funny because SEA is half missing
Love this DIY.
What if you want to go to Philippines?
That map is so inaccurate. Greenland is 1/15 the size of Africa and definitely isn't bigger than Australia.
I found my favorite YouTube channel
Wow they actually did the Great Lakes to outline Michigan. Awesome!
our family travels so much that we definitely have to do this!
where is Taiwan
How can I print it? My printer is printing all funky!
Where's Philippines? :<
Omg Becky's old hair!!
It is a nice project but what is it with the people doing this and similar DIY and missing Puerto Rico??? Com'on!!!! 😓
The funny thing is two Indonesia's like "Main Islands" are missing,but I found that funny 😂😂 Sorry girls
I love this so much!  Will be making it for a friend's birthday
Has anyone painted this with succes? I wonder if it doesn't get to dry and fall apart...
becky's hair has changed so much, oh my lord
They look so different. Kinda crazy.
Wanna do this SO bad!
i loved it because I see My country The Dominican Republic
More action, less blah blah please
Hi, wondering how many mm is the cork you bought?
aha! they forgot Tasmania, Australia
they forgot antartica
Am I the only one who has noticed that they didn't put Wales on the UK? Me being from Wales this has really bugged me 😠
I disliked it cuz there is no Taiwan🇹🇼😐
i see so many diy vids on youtube where the diyers get so carried away that they completely forget to show the final product off...you spent so long making it, don't overlook showing it!
Love this project! And just out of curiosity where are you guys from?
Sadly I'm moving away from my best friend so I'm going to make two USAs and give one to her so we put pins where we've been and where I'm moving two and where she lives and our 'halfway point' (basically where we are going to meet up) this is such a great video
poodle
I disliked it. Sorry Girls.
I love this idea, but instead of taping pieces to walls, it might be a good idea to mount the pieces on a canvas or board so that you could hang it on the wall, but take it down if you wanted to move it or moved to a new place. I also think it would be cool to make a special pin for each place you visited, something that reflected what you remember from that place.
i love your channel it's so unique
Forgot Tasmania
it's really cool!   well even though it's a bit irritating you didn't sulawesi and java (Indonesia) ...hahaha
I'm sorry, but where's Tasmania?
where is the Philippines
ammaaaazzziiiinng
You girls kick ass.
Philippines isn't there
this is so cool. I never actually do diys but I might just do this one. I'd love to do the whole world but that seems like a lot of work. I'll probably just do New York State and use it to put pictures on lok
Can you spray paint it?
oh my god. countries? states??? like wtf are you talking about. these are continents.
Hey they actually added New Zealand
I can't believe you didn't include Tasmania
In all the old videos I've watched of you guys, Becky always looks like she want to cry.
Did you miss Tasmania?
where.is.the.philippines.
no one ever remembers tassie hehe
Everyone is like what about Tasmania and I'm all like what about Antartica
Literally my favourite youtube channel right now. You guys are so innovative! Absolutely love your videos.
Lol what happened to Sri Lanka?
Cuba and Jamaica are not the same island, lol.
they warmed up towards the end awww
wow you look different
finally made it! I'm sure about having the nicest wall of Cologne 😎 thank you sorry girls 👭
Brilliant work and fantastic finished product.  I am inspired by your efforts.  Thank you both for sharing.
amazing. i was actually able to buy  a high quality stencil that was 48" x 29". that really accelerated the process https://www.etsy.com/ca/listing/261437774/world-map-mylar-stencil-x-large-not-a?ga_order=most_relevant&ga_search_type=all&ga_view_type=gallery&ga_search_query=world%20map%20stencil&ref=sr_gallery_6
When i go this im gonna pinnup my travel pics!!!!
Super cool!
Hello can u share the link that you used to print out the map?
I looked on your blog and the map that you created is it still there?
absolutely love this! quick question: will it leave a mark on the wall when you take it off?
lmao you missed part of Australia?? and also greenland isn't that big???
THEY MISSED OUT TASMANIA NOOOO
why does it look like they were crying :(
Theres is no Tasmania which is part of Australia
What happened to Tasmania?!
wouldn't it be easier to just use a pair of good scissors to cut out the cork?
Where's Iceland? Great DIY project, though.
Poor Tasmania always gets left out of Australia hahah. I love this so much though! My sister has a scratch map, but this is so much cooler!
where can i get your map? the one thats condensed..
This is awesome! You forgot Tasmania though! Island under Australia even though it's still counted as Australia! It's beautiful there, you should add it! But other wise great diy! Good job :)
Omg poor Ireland, Cork is sticking out into the ocean! #smallcountryproblems all the little inlets matter 😂 this is such a cool idea though I defintely want to rry it
yay you added territory we arent forgotten for once
if you want the map to be more simple and geometric (and way easier to cut out) then this: http://www.clipartbest.com/clipart-niEnp5BiA would be really neat, or just search google for "simplified world map" and you can find maps in all levels of simplicity!
Love this!  What if I don't find any corkboard? What other material can you suggest?
Soooo going to do this for my state 😱😱
Too bad their "map" isn't to scale...lol Greenland isn't that big... It looks like it's as big as Africa but it's actually 14 times smaller... That's just one mistake...
the cork board doen't stick on the wall!! I tried everything!
Another idea is, that if you want to travel around another continent or part of yours, you can connect the places you want to go with string, so you can see the route!
amazing work!
This is so cool! Thank you for this, definitely going to tackle this once I get my own place :)
Great idea !!!
This is so cool! Thanks for the video hhaa, off to get me some cork and a hot glue gun.. If anyone has any cool ideas for making this without sticking it to the actual wall I'd love to hear it :). I wanna put it on a board but it might make the map too small? How small do you think this can get?
oh yeah! that's going to happen. Thank you girls! :)
Do you think you could do a another cork diy?
Quite sad coz you've forgotten the Philippines. It makes wanna  unsubscribe  coz hello?! you have a Filipino viewers here! •_•
Love the concept. However, I'm moving quite a lot - is it possible to remove the map from your wall and after that re-use it on another wall (without it falling apart haha)?
Both of you are my new idol now, awesome posts!!
BEen looking all over the place for cork roll also. I'd love to do this too!! :) thanks for the pin idea! definetly great!
Philippines come on
Thanks for the tutorial! Its quite long but really usefull
This is so cool!!! I definitely want to make one now!!!!
can you use Masonite ?
so cool
Wow excellent job girls, very inspiring! But you've missed the island "Crete" from Hellas(Greece) and i think island "Cyprus" is missing too :) Sorry if i'm wrong,but thats what i noticed in a quick view! Keep travelling!  :) :) :)
comment αν ηρθες απο Μαρα 😂!
Where can you buy it in the California, USA? What kind of cork board does it have to be?
Girls, you are so amazing! Thank you for this marvellous idea!
I also live in Toronto
you forgot hawaii on the map..
Great idea !!!! i'm a french crafty girl too :) i like you ! u are very nice !!!:p
I'm from Croatia :D
Wow so cool!
Great project. I tried it and it looks great :)
This is amazing!
LOVE IT! <3
Love this!! Wanna do it !
I just wanna lick you guys clean!!
I absolutely love this! You girls are SO creative and such an inspiration!
How did you pin the cork to the wall? Mine keeps falling off :(
you forgot antarctica and hawaii….
You forgot to place Malta in your map :)
I think it'd be cool to like stick behind it pictures of places you travel and stuff
British Columbia
Please come to canada
if you stick it to the wall, is it possible to take it off?
tasmania!! I think its missing lol
I CAN'T WAIT TO DO THIS!!
mmmm where is PUERTO RICO????????
Awesome, awesome, thanks so much!
so happy to see Croatia!!
Africa and Spain should not be touching. Other then that: super great DIY!
very cool DIY
thank you so much for this diy!!! i love  it
So I found the answer to my question seems to be the comment before this, if you live in Australia you can buy it here http://www.fishpond.com.au/Stationery/Cork-Roll-48-x-24/0714963002666 mine arrived today after about 9 days.
so cool! something like this on anthropoligie would cost so much
what are the dimensions of the cork?
How do you purchase the cork board if you live in Australia. I tried but it didn't seem to work. Does anyone in Australia know where to get plain cork board rolls from, many thanks :)
smh. where's the philippines?
this is amazing! I am going to do it for my sister's christmas gift! thank you!
so cool!!
Love love love it !
Um you guys forgot Tasmania. It's at the bottom of Australia
OMG! will do this!!!
Omg so totally doing this! I've wanted to do something like this for ages and now I can. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU. It's 100% perfect. My only problem was is that you forgot little old Tasmania on the bottom of Australia. But seriously this is totally awesome gah can't wait to do it.
I've been looking for something like this for a long time! Definitely gonna do this!
Ah yay! The only thing better than making DIY videos is hearing that people are actually doing them and loving them! THANKS! <3 tweet/insta/tumblr us pics :)
im going to do this. but with the USA.
Bottom that's not to country to the rest of it.
I love this. But you did forget one state of Australia. Tasmania. It's the part down the b
I love this DIY! I love maps and I have a big world map with pins in my room but I always wanted something more extraordinary and now I've found it. ;) Thank you! PS: You should consider visiting Austria.. ;)
There's no Tasmania at the bottom of Australia ! :(
Ariel
Ariel
No Wales at 08:46 :(
I loved it, that is great ! pity you did not spin photos on yours so we could see what it looks like. But I really want to try this. The cork material looks great.
Ariel
where is the phlippines??? love ur vids
You guys deserve soooo much more recognition. Hands down my favorite youtube channel on here. <3
So cool girls, you have the best ideas ever! I always wanted to have something like this, but I had no idea how to even begin, and now I know!  :) Хвала (thank you) ! :)
Good to know about the poster software tool. Clever decor idea! P.S. congrats on Harley success!
I took the sphere part of one of those needles for a different project but I miss placed one of them and then later stepped on it *ouch*
i love all of your videos! i have a big plain wall in my room and i definitely plan on doing this!!
You live in Toronto?! That's awesome!  I have no idea why, but I love finding Torontonian/Canadian Youtubers.
I'm so going to make one for Michigan (where I live) :)
I absolutely love this idea. I am going to travel across Europe this summer and I'm absolutely going to "borrow" this idea from you ;) thank you for this simple yet fantastic idea. best wishes
England !!!!! Live there
just made this! instead of doing the whole world i did the united states and cut out each state. Thanks for the idea!!!!
@hanna you can make it how ever big you want
How much space did you end up using for the map on the wall? I really want to do this but I am not sure if your measurements are to big for my wall :-) please answer xx Hanna
*of
HOW DO YOU HAVE THAT IMAGE PF THE WORLD?
Going to definitely have to do this one. I love it! First time I stumbled across you guys. So many videos to catch up on!
Torontoooo!!! Woot :)
this idea was so cute XD i'm workin on mine right now :D
;o omg this is soo cool! Really want to try this now :D
So cool! I really wanna try this, but I doubt that I find similar cork where I live..
LOVE that you guys are from Toronto!!! That means I can find all the stuff you got! :)
Love it!
this is so awesome!
It's actually kinda hard
This channel is so great because I could totally do this in the summer
I'm fangirling right now because 2 beautiful ladies from Canada pinned Croatia on their map :DD
My boyfriend has a huge, brand new, framed corkboard in his room that he doesn't use. He's been wanting a world map. Do you think I could do this on a board that's already framed? Just cut out the excess?
Are you guys like best friends?
You could use foamboard instead!
Yeah! I went to a Croatia on a cruise a couple years ago! It was awesome :) - K
That's so awesome to hear! Thanks for being such a loyal viewer <3
Welcome to our channel :D
Thank you! <3
I know! I wish I was American just so I could make a huge one of the USA, so cute! Canada isn't as iconic or as nice of a shape :p -K
Mayyybbbeeeeee ;) Haha yes we are Canadian. Don't hold it against us! :P
We used "wall safe" sticky foam squares and it has stayed up for us. You might have to try a couple different sticky options until you find something that works for your walls. Definitely try to go for the name brands like 3M and Scotch though!
I did this DIY and I really love it. However, mine keeps falling off. I didn't want to use a permanent tape because I just painted my walls so I used command strips. Should I use a permanent tape? How is yours holding up?
oh my goodness you forgot Tasmania :( all wells, I loved the DIY!
I hope you ladies see this Uncommon Goods dot com - Search: scratch-map  It's kind of the same idea, but the locations are already labeled. Is there ANY way to DIY this?  Please thumbs up so they see this, I'd rather not spend $30 with shipping etc.
new zealand is actually three islands. not one :P
So cute
this is awesome! I'm really thinking about doing this :)
I was just looking for something like this! Genial! Ty very much, your videos are stunning! :)
Your DIYS are amazing!
so doing this for the holiays!! thankx girl <3
This would look cute in an open faced frame
Can I ask you what website you guys use for your blog?
Definitely going to try this! (I live in Scotland so my flag locations will be very different to yours haha)
Wow amazing!
I love each video I alway do ur diys
This is awesome, I've never even seen anything by you guys before this but I think I'm gonna go to Lowe's right now..
I LOVE this!!! and you put a pin on Iceland, yay! I live there ;)
Awesome!!!
This was absolutly awesome!!!
I L3ve it!!!!!!
Wonderful idea! :)
awesome project thanks!
This is amazing! I'll try and make a pink to match my living room :)
buy it at home depot i just found it
where did u buy cork
Im sooo doing this!!!
This is probably the most perfect thing ever. I vacation all over, every year and the map I have for marking is getting dingy. Keep posting more diys!
Did you mark Croatia?? I live there! :D Amazing DIY, as always! <3
This sounds so cool, I just don't know where to buy cork here...
Really cool!!
Philippines is not on that world map :(
what about foam core. Look it up. It should be a good replacement for cork :)
I started doing this DIY yesterday! The only reason I had to stop was because I cut myself with the razor blade and I had to go to the hospital... Be safe when using sharp things'
Is there anything besides cork you can think of that would work cause I LOVE this idea just not the cork part lol...so any thoughts?
Will make this soon except i'll glue the continents to a framed piece of clear glass so when i move out i can bring it with me :)
Omg I live in Toronto too u guys are amazing!!!
how does it look though b/c the pins are standing perpendicular to the cork... so you can't even read the flags?!
Are u guys Canadian ?
(null)
If we do this thing which is the hashtag we can send it to?
YOUR VIDEOS ARE AMAZING !!!
Can you guys please do a tutorial for terrariums??
amazing! making this for my sister, who is currently serving in the Peace Corps <3
About how big did yours end up being when you spaced it all out on your wall? I think I want to try using your measurements, but I don't really know how big it will end up? Thanks!
Amazing!
im gonna do that next week. cant wait.
This is sooooo cool! I defiantly  wanna do this :D
If I spray paint the cork will I still be able to pin it?
I totally want to do this!!! :D
you traveled to greece?
this is AWASOME! It looks beautiful on the white/grey wall:)
I'm from Hong Kong !!
Where is Puerto Rico?
I've been doing a lot of research lately on a big trip oversea's (I'm a Canuck too!- MB) so this would be a fun project to do before and then a constant reminder of how awesome it was!
you didnt make the philippines :(
I love it so much!
Are you girls cousins?? (:
Where's my malaysia ? :((
great shirt color..........great show as well
i never have any time but i love this sooo much that i will just have to make time because i seriously want this! this is the cutest thing ever, thankyhoooooo! <3<3<3
I've been looking for a unique way to display a map. I lobe this. Definitely gunna do this
Love! I wanted to buy the one from Urban Outfitters but it was so expensive. This is perfect and costs so much less
Hair bun tutorial
i been wanting this.... Can you paint the cork? is there special paint, does it matter?
I love it! Great idea!
Love this!!!
Tasmania and Sri Lanka were left out
This is amazing! I know other Do It girls who would've just outlined the continents and countries instead of cutting them out. This is so creative thank you so much for the inspiration! YEAH I get a new decor in my room!!
So gonna do this!!
You guys should pin the cork board for each Subscriber that says where they are from I will start! I'm from Japan  So pin Japan! I'm from Yokosuka if you want to be specific  Just a suggestion
Poor Tasmania. Always getting the short end of the stick.
omg this is such a cute ideas I can not wait to make this !! (:
Where is Tasmania?????
I want to try it!
You forgot tasmania! How dare you! Sincerely,  constantly-feeling-left-out tasmanians.
Cool idea... love that.. but you missed 1 island in Indonesia.. it called Sulawesi.. anyway, good job gurls... ♡♡
You forgot Sri Lanka! Right below India you can't miss it! c:
You forgot Tasmania
LOVE THIS IDEA I was considering buying a normal map or a tapestry of the World but this is such a better idea! Not only does it work as decoration but it's actually useful. Love love love.
I think i just found the perfect b-day gift for my sis. THANKS! :)
Awesome mother-daughter project :)
This will make an awesome present! Hope he likes it :D
It will be a great addition to your room! Goodluck <3
Very cool project! It would have been nicer to see more of the process and less of you girls sitting on a couch chatting (because you could easily overlap audio with the creation process)
where's tasmania!
Toronto represent!
this is soo cool! definatly going to try this! :D
I need to do this!!!
Hablan mucho!
My mom and i are going to make this this Summer :D
I'm from Belgium to ;D Xx
Well the weather is not to great in Belgium. I guess Canada will always be home to me, but I have lived here for 2 years and after 1 more I will move back to Canada, so it's not a full-time thing.  I like it here but Canada is my favourite place in the world, but living here has opened up so many opportunities and my private school is amazing.  You should totally visit Canada though!
16
Ooh, i wanna visit Canada ! I'm from Belgium.. Do you enjoy it here?
This is perfect!  I moved from Canada to Belgium and my family and I travel sooo much now!  Thanks for the great idea <3
I wish i travelled more to be able to fill it out if I did this. But I'm definitely going to do this when I move out! I want it on my wall like yours!
Such an awesome DIY project! Totally making this.
You guys have become my all time favourite channel! AND you're from Toronto too! :)
Definitely doing this!! I have this blank wall in my room that I've been wondering what to do with, and now I know exactly what to put on it! Thanks guys :)
ahh this is awesome thank you guys for doing this <3
you guys always have such cute and creative ideas!!!
I want to try!!
Cool! Wanna do it! But dont know where to find the right cork (i live in Russia) but thanks for such a great ideas!!
So creative!
