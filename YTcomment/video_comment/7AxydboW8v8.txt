no chillis and no ginger....
Can I add oyster mushroom sauce as well to the recipe ?
Folks, VERY IMPORTANT! Please be aware that Mandy verbally said Baking Powder (NO) in the chicken marinade but meant Baking soda and did spell on the screen if you were using CC. She made up verbally in follow through PINCH OF BAKING SODA! i can't stress enough though to add salt throughout the cook a little at a time. I was so hesitant in mine because of all the soy sauce. So I sprinkled some salt on the whole pan after tasting it and it was an unbelievable difference. You will see. I though I had ruined the recipe but I saved it by sprinkling salt very carefully on the whole thing and then folks can salt their dish. Also it's not the same without a couple of fried eggs on top of your dish to let the yolk meld into the rice for creaminess and I never eat my fried rice without plain yogurt. Aloha, Hilo Paul
Can one use olive oil instead?
Love your channel! Will try this recipe! ❤
There is no reason to use so much oil!! Not healthy and looks very greasy !!
Brilliant 👏
Yummy 😋
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Minute rice? Can you use it?
I mad😢this tonight was amazing
This might be my favourite video on the internet, always so excited to rewatch when end up with leftover rice in the fridge
This has stood the test of time.  Still a brilliant dish
What is the best type of rice for a authentic fried rice? I recently switched from a instant rice
❤❤❤ thanks
Peas not beans.
Awesome recipe!😊
Great video,just curious,so baking soda doesn’t need rinsing off chicken before cooking?
I made this dish in a wok, OMG, I was delicious
Burnt eggs.  No thanks.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
se ve muy rico
I love the way she explains c Very well
Trying tonight! It looks fantastic!!
Fuiyohhh!
The amount of oil she added ayo 💀
do chinese chefs ever use minute rice??? its the only rice ive ever  cooked myself and i have no excuse as to why...nut i have a feeling that its a big reason chinese take out fried rice always tastes soooo deliciouse but my minute rice is so dry and just not sticky and and tender like take out chkn veg fried rice... if anyone has pointers i would truly appreciate it if you replied to my comments please and ty!!!
I like Chinese people that cook Chinese food... 😂
Seen your recipes a few times, years in fact, never dared to try-tried it for the first time yesterday, I’m never buying Fried rice again-came out PERFECT. X
How about peanut oil?
Is a print  version of the Chinese Chicken Fried Rice recipe available? Thanks
PEOPLE PRESS THE LIKE BUTTON! It’s free
I sure appreciate your videos!  Thank you!
I'm a pathetic cook and my wife is out of town. I've made this recipe twice now and it's turned out exceptional both times. I am very grateful for this excellent beginner-friendly video.
If your fried rice look chunky you have failed, use long grain rice so they are less sticky. You can use thai rice, or use the rice you left in the fridge yesterday. You want rice that are dryer.
Green peas in fried rice 🤔
Excellent. Thank you
I ordered a wok through your link. I look forward watching many of your recipes. They have your YouTube channel on User Manual.
Straight to the point!! ❤ thanks!!
What if u don’t have day old rice 🤔
Fantastic!  Did not know the trick for tender chicken, thank you it really worked
I tried this recipe this weekend for my daughter birthday it was lit🔥 everyone like it! Thank you ❤
Wow ! Tried this ! Finally a near authentic experience 😢it was so delicious 🤤 thank you! (Used frozen veggies) but even then it was delish!
I made this today and it was very nice so I recommend giving it a try
I would have enjoyed if it wasn't so  spaced and it said one pan not everyone own a wok. So it was a egg pan a spot to boil rice then refrigerate it 30 mins to prep the chicken. Then wait on it to show you how it doesn't brown now. My husband sent me this i love fried rice but I'm with uncel Roger it only needs 3 ingredients this was overkill
This was such a fu:&,$*# mesz
A pinch of nothing does nothing 😢
This is not easy in any way thanks
Ever since finding this particular recipe and step by step video, my wife and I have watched/made this going in five times in the past few months? So easy and such an efficient way to empty leftover veggies!  Thanks from Southern USA!
So you added baking powder and baking soda?? 🤔
Which do you fry forst? The chicken or the egg? I missed this part.
I have your souped up recipes wok and I make this fried rice recipe often.  It is always brilliant!
Haiyaa no msg  better not let uncle roger know about this
Just made some great fried rice thanks!
I am at the moment eating the same way cooked fried rice but beef one my wife brought me from a Japanese/ Chinese restaurant, along watching and eating thus enjoying midnight meal.
I appreciate silence between instructions
I love your content. I made several of your recipes before, gonna try this one next. Thank You.
I love her enthusiasm! She’s so funny!
What type of rice do you prefer please?
Lil Wayne cooking chicken fried rice: The wok is hot the wok is hot haaaa haaa the wok is hot the wok is hot haaa haaaa
Can you post which brand of each sauce you used? Not every soy sauce is made the same. Thank you
I just tried your recipe last night and I have to say it tasted better than the restaurant. Thank you! I did not know about dark soy sauce! That made the difference. My wife loved it. This is now my go to recipe.
This has become a regular on the meal roster for me and my wife. Thanks for sharing x
Thanks so very much. I did it and came out great.
No msg???
Very tasty indeed, Thank you!
Where’s the recipe?
🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳
Going to try this tomorrow night.....thanks so much!
Mini corn dogs over here.
This video is awesome I'll come back to it many times thank you for making it so simple to understand
Just got one of your woks, can't wait to make this!!!
I love your attitude. )))
Thank you again Mandy. I have made your Singapore noodle 8 times in the last 6 months. I just made your Chicken fried rice, but I did add a little honey to give it a slightly sweet flavor... Delicious!
Fantastic
This was a quick, easy, delicious chicken fried rice recipe. Thank you for the instruction. I really enjoyed making this.
No roasted Sesame oil???😮
I just simply love this lady! She is really the best Chinese Chef on Social Media! ❤
Wonderful video
My whanau (Family) Love this . Thanks
Thanks Mandy for sharing  if you don’t mind can you make sweet and sour chicken l love this recipe and l cannot find it in your channel 🥰
Looks absolutely delicious!!!
The recipe is so delicious and you're so lovely to watch 😍 Thank you for sharing.
That looks delicious...and you're cute.
❤❤❤❤
looks good
I cooked this today. That was by far the best Fried Rice I ever made. Thank you so much for sharing your recipe!  I seasoned the Chicken with dark soy sauce and pressed garlic plus a little yoghurt and leave it in the fridge for (max) 2 hours. The chicken will be smooth and really soft. 🥰
No ginger??
Carrots need a minute or they gonna be extra crunchy
Oh she’s cooking, I didn’t even notice
You are the cutest! I love your videos…they always make me smile and very hungry!
I've been making your recipe for years I love your rice recipe  thank you so much for sharing
Looks good & easy and tasty 😋 will have it for tea tomorrow 🇬🇧
Fantastic chicken fried rice!
Thank u it tasted exactly like takeout
love it!
Yum will definitely try this
In the video, when you put the rice into the wok, it looks to me like 1 cup of rice rather than the 2 cups that the recipe calls for. So when you add 1 tbsp light soy sauce and 2tsp dark soy sauce, you get the rice to be a nice brown color. However, when I do this with 2 cups of rice (that the recipe calls for), I don't get the same brown color on the rice. I'm assuming I should double the soy sauce amounts if I am using 2 cups of rice, but it would be nice to know if I am correct. EDIT: Okay, I see it calls for two cups of COOKED rice, rather than what I worked with which was to start with 2 cups of uncooked rice, cook that and I wound up using a lot more than 2 cups of cooked rice.
Where are your chopsticks?
I’m kinda late to the game, but I just made this recipe and it turned out amazing. Cheers 🥂
Cooked this tonight and it was the best! Thank you for sharing!
I did one just like this a few days ago but my rice was popping and flying all over the place. It was like popcorn.?
Is the stove on? The food steams in the plate but there is no reaction in the wok.
Very well explained. Thank you!
Thanks mindy, getting better now with some practice. The day old rice is key!! My family is so happy.  They dont want take out anymore!!
3:50 Mr. Krabs
baking powder or baking soda?
Carrots and peas?? These are Northern European vegetables from the 70s! I don’t eat them. I’m thinking zucchini, sweet red pepper, mushrooms and spicy green chili!
This recipe not clear enough. You messed up with the baking powder and baking soda. They are not the same.
Tried this recipe for tea and it was delicious
I'm down with it just maybe not the dark soy
cute voice ❤
Thanks for the vid, it turned out good
Looks good even without the chicken. Thank you so much for your generosity.
What a great video, so informative and right to the point. Can't wait to make this tonight 😍
I'd eat her fried rice
It helps that you're beautiful ❤️.
I will do this tomorrow looks yummy.
I make my fried rice myself because of you now 😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
I love everything you said and make mine nearly identical but i put sesame oil in with the chicken marinade, is that a usual thing for chinese cooking?
is there a printable recipe
Any advice for making a full 4 people meal of this
Great recipe...#fajitafridays This looks delicious 💥💥💥
Making this as we speak! Thanks for making it simple and straightforward.
You make it look so easy, and it looks SO good! Thank you for sharing! ❤
Wow nice and simple ingredients. Wil be making my rice tonight so I can make my fried rice tomorrow night!!!
Those are peas sweetheart not green beans :) You're so adorable and an amazing cook though fr!
This is the best looking fry rice. Ty sistuh
@souped up recipes What type of rice do you use? And do you cook the rice separately first????.
👍🏼👍🏼
this was the best fried rice I have ever cooked thank you so much
Im a new subscriber, came across your video while trawlling the internet. Love your recipe and cannot wait to show my husband, Look very simple and straigh forward...surely even we cant mess it up lol
Why light and dark soy sauce? What is the difference? Thanks
looks mushy
Wow yummy
Do you not rinse off the bicarbonate before cooking?
Used this recipe and it tasted amazing, thank you so much! ❤
Looks nice, but theres no way this is better than takeout. Hardly any Asian seasoning.
Greetings from a West Melanesian from the famous Maluku Spice Islands  living in the Netherlands.
I like your channel❤ Keep up the good work!
Ummmmmm mind is i ask whether salt and pepper required or not?
This has become a regular dinner for me, I love it! Thank you again for this
Thank you so much❣️❣️🍛🍚🍲
I just made this for the first time ever and it came out so perfect I can’t believe it smells so good thank you so much ❤
I’m making some American fried rice.  Use some leftover Popeyes chicken or KFC.
Looks delicious! Needs MSG…❤❤❤
I made this with leftover brown rice and frozen veggies, but it was really good. Thanks for the video!
Thats the way to do it ,excillent
Going to the shop atm cooking this today :)
This recipe is better then takeout literally
What type of rice did she use?
I tried this tonight, we loved it! I added a bit of white pepper here and there, a bit of 5 spice near the end, and plenty of MSG but aside from that it was the same. Thanks!
Made this tonight it was awesome!! All I added was fish and oyster sauce for more umami flavor. Loved it. Thanks
Simple. I will make tomorrw
Yum, looks good. I like to add about a teaspoon of sesame oil.
I love your recipe because it is very well-structured and, therefore, easy to follow. I've made it at home 4 times and I've also replaced the chicken with shrimps a few times. Thank you for sharing it.
Thank you
Not bad but way too dark
TeeHee that's funny.😊
I thought u couldn't reheat or eat day old rice? 🤔 Great video, thank u  👍🏼
Just did it. Delicious!
It looks like a very delicious fried rice!  Easy to follow your cooking instruction. Thank you!
Best Chinese fried rice ever!!!
Lol I bought an induction wok cooker, tried the egg like this after watching your video, egg was burnt through to black within 2 seconds all I could do was laugh :)
Name of rice or just any rice?
How should I add some Sichuan peppercorn to this dish?
Cornstarch, veg oil
An answer to the old old question...What come first ? The chicken or the egg , It's the egg 🍳
the milf is a cook, too
Good food, are you chinese 😂
done & succeeded. thanks girl!  PS: for an indonesian twist - add some ketjap manis (sweet soy sauce) ... bio of course 😅
Going to make this dish tonight!
Just made this in my beautiful Souped Up Recipes Wok which I have had for about three years now.....Delicious and easy!
I made today and it came delicious. Thank you for the recipe🤗
I AM STARVING 😃
Can I use regular soy sauce instead of light soy sauce? Is it different?
Are you supposed to boil the rice
😊thank you for your video!  I used sesame oil plus butter and only one teaspoon of the soy sauce because it's mostly for my toddler and I have to watch her sodium.  It turned out great.  Next time I'll get some low sodium soy sauce and vegetable oil.
Thanks for sharing your recipe it is the BEST one I've seen.
I made this and the family ate it, likely because they felt sorry for me i think. Most likely I'll find some in the house plant pots. I don't know were i went wrong except that I'm using a frying pan with induction hob and i doubled the ingredients and used frozen veg. My rice was a day old and only out of the fridge. The rice didn't seem fried but i had it in ages...  I don't know why i bother I'm a terrible cook. I could wire anything as an electrician but put me in a kitchen and expect ridiculously bad results. Unfortunately my partner is worse than me at cooking so we're all going hungry with my failed attempts at feeding a large family without breaking the bank with takeaway dinners every night... So to summarise, i had an awful result but it's likely my own errors.
Do you mean baking powder or baking soda?
You the best
My granddaughter and I love your fried rice recipe, we always make it together, thank you so much for sharing your recipe with us, we'll be making this for years to come, thank you so much, Mandy... 😊
Is it healthy
How do you make the rice though?
You’re lovely! And the recipe is wonderful
If u  an do a cook book I will purchase it
I wonder what Uncle Roger thinks of this video. xD
Are you a lover of Asian foods but tired of same old thing? Come check out Lyn’s home cooking Sotanghon Soup, a home cooked Filipino dish; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptjUBb7q1I
Is there an ingredient list or just have to write down ingredients and amounts from the video.
It tasted so good
Thank you. This was a perfect fried rice video. I watched it while preparing.
What brand soy sauce do you use, I've used best choice brands and la choi but my rice doesn't get the color  like yours
Thank you ❤
món ăn thật hấp dẫn
Hi thanks for the video.  After watching the video, I went and cooked chicken fried rice with chicken thighs. I marinaded the chicken in 2 tsp soy sauce, 1 tsp sesame seed oil, and 1/2 tsp of baking powder. My undestanding is that baking powder is made of bakiing soda, cornstarch and  cream of tarter.    Any way, it came out great. I tried Shiitake mushroms, 1/4 cup onions and 3/4 cup frozen mixed vegetables. For the sauce, I added  a little Soy Sauce, Oyster Sauce and Hoisin Sauce.
Honey thank you, 🥰
What kind of rice you have used?
Yummy
I don’t eat carrots or peas, so I would use browned mushrooms, sweet red pepper and possibly browned zucchini. Caramelised onion too, of course! And fresh bean sprouts at the very end for the crunch 😊
Thank you.
Definitely  going to cook this great dish soon ..
Looks yummy 😊❤
We make this once every two weeks, it’s great!!!
This recipe turned out well thank you
this with some hot sauce 😋😋
You cook this exactly how it supposed to be cooked I’m sure it was delicious
Oh my word I made this last night and IT WAS AMAZING!!
I always come back to this recipe. It is so delicious 😋
I followed your instructions and shared it with some friends. Of course I asked their opinions and everyone said it's better than takeaway. Now where have I heard that before?
Great instructions, dinner came out perfect 👍 Thank you
No sesame oil? Not good!
that wok looks amazing
Why is this in a jacksepticeye visage playlist
Baking soda or baking powder?
This is the second time I am making this dish with high demand from my family,  following your instruction made it easy and very delicious.thank you.
I prefer chicken thigh since they stay moist easier. Great recipe thank you.
Where’s the msg????
🤗🤗🤗
This was so easy and delicious. Great tip on tenderizing the chicken and it definitely works.
I was looking for a recipe for Chinese fried rice and with 8.7M views, I had to try this recipe. I followed this but, made it vegan and used cauliflower rice instead and it's delicious! It's a very forgiving recipe as Souped Up Recipes said, I used mushrooms and carrots. Delicious, and ultra low carb and vegan with my substitutions!
I add some chopped celery and water chestnuts to mine, super yummy!!! :)
So yummy
Thank you just made this and it was very delicious
This looks amazing..Thank you. ❤
yummy yummy!!! Thank you , It was delicious. Frank from Oklahoma.
i tried it. my first Chinese recipe. I'm so happy it tastes exactly like the one i eat in canteen. thank youu.
Tasty!!!!!
Soy de Honduras🇭🇳  ❤Lo he hecho varias veces muchas gracias por tu receta. Lo Amo😊
Tortured chicken with rice.....NO THNKS.....GO VEGAN
I love your videos!! Thanks for shearing your talents
I will try to do it at home but i need to find a pan that is close enough to your pan.
My wife is going to make this for a group of fourteen. Any suggestions on how to make it taste the same as a small batch?
Love this but I'd never use vegetable oil it's neither traditional nor good tasting nor healthy
looks good
Your so sweet 🌸
YOU'RE ADORABLE!!!!!! ❤️😋🤤
Your channel is my go to for Chinese home cooking
Thank you
'Take away' not take out.
All that oil is going to kill folks
Before serving chopped green onion works well.
my cholesterol went flying high with all that oil lol YIKES
I make it with crushed chilli, ginger and garlic, sesame oil and the rest is the same. I guess it's more the Indonesian way.
I like your videos 👍👍👍
Awesome! and delicious.....Thanks! :)
I like this being that i have already have Rotisserie chicken i will might lose out on the preparation of fresh chicken. I guess the whole point is use what you have and use common sense and your cooking times especially with left over rice and sauce preparations to sort it out. Thank you.
It looks great im going to try this but I feel like you lost flavour from cooking everything separate then just adding it back in later
Love all your recipes.they all great thank u.
Thank you for the printable recipe of this. Very few people do that.
Should you use jasmine rice or regular white rice?
Add a pinch of baking sofa or baking powder I think there’s a difference in the two ingredients  Please adviseq🙂
I made it but no taste at all and I  think you might forgot to add the other spices.
How many bowls do you even need to make this food lol i would need like 3 dishwashers going all at once
Thanks for posting your recipe it is very bueno i mean so good
They are peas not grean beans silly :}
😱 my rice was amazing!!!
My husband came across your channel one day. Ever since then you are my go to person to make all kinds of Asian dishes
I made this recipe and it was absolutely delicious.♥️
Excellent video, as yours always are. For variety, I would add cashews and pineapple.
I added some garlic and ginger to mine, but I panicked the other day when I ran out of a pre made fried rice paste mix. Saw this, tried it and I decided I'm never buying pre made mix again! Thank you!
Was a bit scared to make it, but it turned out great! My 9yo gave me a 👍. Thank you! (Was easier than it looks.)
I am going to try this.   By the way you are absolutely adorable.  Thanks.
I really like this woman she is entertaining and a great cook...😊
Lovely...lovely
you are just too dern cute!! i'm so glad i found your channel. i'm subscribing because you listed the ingredients and amounts in the description box which is important to me. and you taught me...'ancient chinese secret'...about the wok being hot and the moisture of the sauces won't mix well unless you do it quickly, so thank you. i can't wait to learn how to cook 'chinese' and you are the perfect host. professional... yet fun and you have a great attitude.
Was the rice already cooked? Mine looks way more dry
I've made this recipe many times. Sometimes I add Broccoli and julienne celery to the veggie mix. It's incredible, and really is better than take out!
I keep burning the rice to the bottom of the wok, idk what I am doing wrong lol
I tried to follow you step by step during lunch today .  taste was good , but the final was not as I expected.  Too much water came out of the chicken , the rice color did not turn brown like yours, even though I added more sauces 😢

Thanks for the recipe. It looks great.
Just watched the video. Looks wonderful. Will definitely make this. Thank you.
I made this twice in the last week and couldn't love it more! Thank you so much ❤
Hi, why you put corn starch why not plain flour instead
Lovely easy recipe 😊 a bit too much vegetable oil though. Rather use olive oil for health benefits x
Love this girl so much I unliked her video just so I could like it again! ❤😢❤
Came out really good
Thanks very much
Very nice #lvdrizzle
We used basmatic rice. 2 cups rice + 2 cups water in the rice cooker. Fridge overnight, then brought up to room temperature before cooking. Zero effort required to separate the grains of rice.. Turned out great. Had a bit of a mare with the chicken sticking to our new wok.
No fair she got the cheat code!¡
YUM!🫨👌⭐️
I made this one tonight without the chicken and with a few other alternations (fresh peas instead of beans and matchstick carrots instead of diced).  It was DELICIOUS!  I can’t wait to try all the other recipes!
1:00 crack two EHGGS!!!!
Thanks honey. You made my day. My fuzzy eating daughter  has finished up the whole plate today.
My son loves chicken fried rice! I tried this recipe last night on the addition as I added fish sauce and for the first time, my spouse and kids and said this was the best they’ve ever tasted! Thank you for the recipe
🌈🎼🙏🪷🛸🧩🌟🤩
Where is the MSG... 😐
made it. in all the years i've been making fried rice i've never got the flavor just right.  i never would have thought to add dark soy sauce.  you just stopped years of disappointment.  thank you!
You're so cute❤
Need to show me all the secrets
This looks really good and delicious. Chinese fried rice is just waow. who won't love it. Keep sharing more and more and a lot of love from planet ayurveda
5 stars on this recipe. I made this tonight for some friends from the Philippines and they said it was the best fried rice they ever had!! I used shrimp instead
Interesting! 👍
My brother had this friend, and whenever he went to this Chinese cafeteria, that my mom ran, he would get white rice, soy sauce, 3+ eggrolls and this hot mustard from a powdered mix. He KNEW what he wanted to eat. So. He was a really interesting dude. I was much younger than him, but I admired how he knew what he liked from 'Chinese' food. So. Fried rice is not for everyone, but if you don't like 'rice,' you're kinda odd. Just admit it. Mandy is right about the color of the fried rice, having a deep meaning.
you are so cute! i love watching your videos!
Your telling me a chicken fried this rice?
This is so good, I added some teriyaki sauce, garlic powder and onion powder including the soy sauce (but not too much) my family loved it!
Looks too dark
omg thanksss
If the rice was freshly cooked will it be mushy in the dish? My was.
She is a very talented cook!  Very good Chef.  I will make this recipe too.   "Adventure time, Beemo" (LOL!) 🤣 Her voice only.
I’m definitely gonna try it today but with broccoli’s carrots fresh vegetables yummy looks delicious ❤
Looks absolutely delicious and very easy to make. I will make this recipe in the near future. Thank you so very much for sharing!!
Very good job explaining how to make this recipe !
Tried your recipe for the first time.  This is the best chicken fried rice I’ve come across. I’ll definitely be doing this again 👌🏾
Amazing just made this thank you
Thank you
Yummy food
You are a beautiful little China doll!
What kind of seasoning you use??
That looks so amazing and tempting! ❤
Is it baking soda or baking powder? She said both.
Looks delicious 😋
Is this all done on high heat?
I made this with tofu instead of chicken skipped the egg, since my household is vegan. Delicious!
This was delicious! However i simply used frozen carrots&peas,,and it was still great
I am making this today for the first time.  I will let you know!
Your videos are so entertaining and engaging, I can't wait to see what you cook up next! 😍♥♥ Thanks for sharing your video #SoupedUpRecipes! ❤
Yum
170423
Thank you so much!Was so good!I love it!It was divine!❤❤❤
This recipe is a good one!!
I always come back to this recipe to make! So good! And so easy!
Hi! I am about to try to use your recipe to make my son some delish homemade fried rice but I'm really not great in the kitchen ... For this recipe, how much rice should I use? Also, what's the difference between light and dark soy sauce?
Thankies!💙✌️
Love it
😂 A fantastic receipe and very clear to follow.  You almost looked orgasmic when you took your first bite  🎉
Just wondering, before you cook the rice in the wock, do you just take it out of the bag or packet or do you have t cook it in a ricecooker first?
Thank you so much for your videos. You introduced me to Asian cooking. Love you and your videos❤
@queenleo87r.64 hey ❤
Thank you!! For the video. I feel so hungry now, can't wait to make this dish. Great Job!
i made this and my parents love it. My dad literally thought it was from a restaurant lmao
You mentioned in the end of the video to ad a pinch of salt,don’t you think there is enough salt in the soy sauce? Just a thought
This is my go to recipe.  Best one I’ve ever found.  I think I’ve watched it at least ten times over the last 3 years.
You can better your fried rice.  Meat : cut dried red chinese sausage (pan stir fried with oil till crispy cook- set aside), prawn meat.  Vegetables: chopped french beans, lettuce, brown shimeiji, big onion.  Seasoning: just oyster sauce and light soy sauceand fried garlic
Hello Mandy, thank you for the wonderful video, may I please find out where to buy the wok that was used for this video? Thank you again.
Yummy yummy
Oh gosh, feed me please. Lol... Will cook it this week.
Hello is this regular white rice or Jasmine rice?
I made this after watching your video and my five year old son asked for it as his birthday dinner! Thanks!
He'll yeahhhhhh can't wait to try it out with my Mommy and Daddy
May I know the kind of rice you used?
Great recipe. It was presented so easy a 3 year old could follow the steps and make an excellent meal. Thank you.
Would Uncle Roger approve ?
Thank you!
How do u fully cook the carrots in 2-3 minutes ( fresh)
This recipe is so good. No more driving to Chinese restaurant. I also made the  "How to Make Sweet and Sour Chicken (酸甜鸡, 酢鳥の作り方)" by the art of cooking and it turned out wonderful. I didn't know Chinese  food taste 5 times better when made at home.
Yummmmmm 😍 SAVED!
I trust this woman.
Too late here …I pit baking powder in my chicken to marinade ??? And way to much oil no you got me mad…..hope I have not ruined my chicken here ???
I love it.
her voice is lovely.
U have the asian smile so I instantly trust u
Can you replace vegetable oil with olive oil?
I am so on this!
Good video cook
Great! easy fresh I am going to do it. Thank you.
Love the level of detail.
what is the name of the rice...
Is it baking soda or baking powder that I add a pinch of?  Thanks!
Frozen veg better than fresh? 😂
See she makes it look so easy, and she’s so nice so I really think I can do it, then I try and I always make blunders but I’ll try my best
perfect tutorial, I was inspired by all your contents
Tried it today, it’ll be on the weekly menu!
My only critique is that I’m not sure whether to use baking soda or baking powder
What is it with peas and carrots in fried rice?! I hate that!
Ibs been coming back to this video for about 5 years. Best recipe, I always forget tho😂
very nice....
Do you add baking soda or baking powder?
Looks delicious! ❤️❤️❤️
After eating all the fat, how does she manage to stay slim.
Can I use whole grain brown rice?
Would it change the flavor much if the dark soy sauce was left out?
Cool! Thank you!
another reason to ditch the take-out menus. you don't need them! you got ingredients on hand and you'll save money!
Meal prep food.
Excellent presentation
What kind of rice is this ?
This is very easy to follow. Thank you for making such a detailed video
So good love from israel❤
yummy
Intelligent and straight to the point.  Great video.  Going to try this out for myself tonight, thank you!
Looks great . Can't wait to try it.
how much of a dif in flavor and texture does a walk make? i had a electric wok but it wasnt good at all.even with day old rice
does it need to be in high heat or medium or low please help?
Awesome
i do trust you
Any advice about the rice? What kind is best? Is it fully cooked or partially?  Please advise.  Thank you
Yum!
I just finished making this and it’s a hit!!!  I have been looking for a good and easy recipe for chicken fried rice and this was perfect 😊
Wow
I make your recipe all the time.. It’s Christmas Day and we are having all the family over, and they all wanted me to make fried rice… Thank you ❤
The most precious tips were the separate preps for each ingredient. The separate egg prep was golden!
Thank you 😊
I love your accent but you said spatula like SpongeBob btw it’s a compliment and I’m fasho making this now
A big thank you for sharing this recipe, I’m making this tonight, can’t wait.
Thanks for sharing!
Too much oil
Nicely done
I love Chinese rice but I keep rice white.
This was really good. Saved me with bento ideas for lunch at work. Best homemade fried rice ever
I cook something similar but with left over pre cooked chicken. It's very moreish, and I am always sad when my chicken has finished. A few cauliflower/broccoli florets for added crunch.
I made this tonight, and it was delicious! Thank you for the simple recipe. 🙂
What did she do with the egg? Is she a magician?
We are allergic to soy :(
Hi again 😀 Can I please ask you what can I use if I don't  have cornstarch ?
How much chicken did you use?  How many cups of rice?  That would be helpful.  Otherwise, great.
I don't use oil but cooking spray less fat
Is there anything instead of soy sauc e ? Dont like soy sauce😒
I have been using your recipes for 2 years now and Im never disappointed . I would love it if you could do a  simple beef noddle soup recipe, Im sure you would knock it out of the park. Love your content ✨️ 💕
As looks mighty good but too much oil! 😊
never eat it without the rice! unless you are very hungry ^_^
the only thing i hate about these videos is that the chef always puts the food in there mouth and says mmm nice without chewing it first - WHY
This was, by far, the best "how-to" for fried rice. I love @UncleRoger but your video was just simple to follow! Thank you, you've made a new sub with me!
Excellent recipe. Looks simple to put together.
wow
Love this, just what I was looking for! Thanks :)
Mmmm this really looks really  good. 😋😋😋😋
Hi, what was the 2nd name of the soy sauce?
I want to marry you woman!  You're pretty and you can cook too 😍
pel ngan pyar yay ko nel nel layy pel htae naut khar
THAT WASNT A CHICKEN THAT COOKED THAT RICE!!  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
Pretty sure you need sesame oil. It makes a huge difference
I also liked hearing the food being cooked :(
Super 💕👌
Gracias !!!!!
Looks great! Making it tonight. Have a question.  I don't have any dark soy sauce, so will be using light only. Should I change the measurements?
Looks really good!
Very nice video, thank you, and your explanation is straight forward 👍🙂
Could you also tell us which soyasaus you used for the chicken marination?
AMEN
Ill try it, good video
thank you! This tastes just like the restaurant! Baking soda was a secret I was missing, really changes the flavor!
I love watching your videos your pleasant voice is easy to listen to and your skills are fun to watch. One question i have is, do you use a rice maker? If so what brand or model is best?
Love your recipe. Have tried it twice and, oh, so good!
Thank you 😊
I'm really good at that part: Beat it well
What's that vulgar instrument I saw being used to cosume an Asian dish?
Самый понятный рецепт! Спасибо!
I've been making this for a while now. My entire family loves it. The only thing that I sometimes add to the recipe is a bit of ginger along with the garlic. Not too much, I don't want it to overpower the basmati profile.
thank u. u explain it so well. i am going to make it shortly!!
Nice, looks tasty, I will add a little pineapple ..thanks😊
I made this last week and my wife loved it! I'm allowed to cook again thank you 🤣
If not baking powder then what?
we love you!
Thank you very much for this awesome video. I'm about to make this for my family.
Is there something else to use beside soy sauce?
WHAT A WONDERFUL SOUL
Looks like Manna from heaven!😋
No matter what oil I use at what heat, it always spats and explodes like a volcano. Also, any time I've used my wok, anything I put in it sticks bad, especially rice, giving me a weird, thing burnt layer I have go scrape out later when I clean it. What and how am I doing things wrong. I do recipes exactly as say 😭
Your making me hungry lol going to be maken this dish soon thanks 👍
Tried this receipt tonight, turned out excellent !.. wife and I really enjoyed the rice.  also want to say that I bought the "Souped Up Recipes " Wok and it really made a difference cooking, the steel spatula fits the contour of the wok precisely which makes very easy to mix, flip and dice the food which is being cooked, worth the investment in my humble opinion. Thanks for sharing this receipt   cheers
Thank you!
Love this video!   This is easy to follow and I love the comments!!
Better be careful, the Chinese might get jealous of this video.
this is the recipe i go to everytime we want fried rice   thanks a lot
Awesome detailed video!! Your great!!!
I giggles too
I've always called this my 'Budget lunch' meal that I also eat for dinner. Of course, the combination of things in this video is perfect with those ingredients as is, but if you are short of something or have some food in the fridge, this is a good dish to use it all. Ingredients are sauteed one after the other or in bunches of similar-sized items and moved to another pot and mixed back together at the end or any combination of items. Sauteed mushrooms with garlic powder (or minced garlic), thinly sliced celery, sesame oil, soya sauces, tapioca starch, rice, scrambled eggs, leftover meat like roast or pork cut thinly or thinly sliced hot dogs, or slivers of Spam fried up, green peppers, carrots, peas, green beans, broccoli, tiny bits of cauliflower, and whatever else you can think of.
You are my new best friend !!!!  Bravo !!!!  👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
looks good. thanks!
Just finished and it's amazing!!!  Thanks so much for this recipe!
I'd love to own that wok, it is well seasoned.
nice
What kind of rice is this? How do you cook the rice before?
My family loved this recipe! Thank you so much for sharing 😋
Very tasty.
Well done my dear .thanks for  showing excellent  chicken fried  rice with veg .I will try definitely .it looks yummy
How do you manage to keep your size after all these years, do you have an exercise secret?
If you look at the actual recipe, it's baking soda not powder (it does offer an apology for the mistake on there).
I use chicken thighs instead of breast, cheaper and juicier. I also use a little sesame oil mixed with the vegetable oil. Other than that this recipe is a winner. I use bone in thighs even cheaper! But deboning thighs is not easy, fyi.
I am anxious to try it this weekend!  Looks amazing!!
Great video and recipe! Thank you! 👍🏼
Can you use sweet soy sauce?
I have prepared Chinese fried rice before with mixed - though never entirely satisfying - results. Your approach is very different to mine, so I am going to give it a try tonight. I have no doubt it's going to be spectacular. Thank you for your channel and will be checking on your other recipes constantly!
Thanks so much I enjoyed watching you cook this recipe. Looks so inviting to eat🙂
That fried rice colour is absolutely gross
I love your videos I am American and using your videos to learn to cook in a another culture 😊 thanks you are talented,smart and beautiful.
Adding Bean Sprouts gives it so much more flavor!  Try it
I love your enthusiasm
Delicious!! Whole family love it, I had no chicken so used chopped up bacon. Thank you 😊
Jiio
I would cook the chicken a little more before dropping the mixed veggies. Poultry must be cooked well.
the bestt of the best recipe
I'm trying this today. Thank you. I wish you well. Stay encouraged.
I made this last week and its the best chicken fried rice I have made. Fresh veg does make a difference (I had used frozen before) - and the chicken in cornstarch, oil, baking powder and soy is a good trick to make the chick succulent. I now use that for other recipes! (without the soy)
Appreciate your instructions. Adding baking powder and corn starch and soy sauce to the chicken was fantastic. I think you leaked secrets, it actually tasted like takeout.
I have tried so many methods to master egg fried rice, and I just cant do it. :(  The last one I made was very good, similar to this one. I will try this one, it looks so good. I have a large cast iron Lodge wok that works lovely for all stir fries , but I never attempted rice in it yet. I think I will buy this carbon wok soon.
thank you for all your recipes!!
Her little face. Like a cartoon character.
And what’s the secret ingredient you didn’t show us 😂
Great recipe & video. Thx
U r so cute!  Nice simple video
Jesus is coming soon please share and repent
So be sure to use rice that is already prepared,  can you go into detail on how to prepare the rice?
This looks good, but I love green bell peppers and I think i am going to add them some way. I still like this cook out.
BMO just showed me how to make fried rice
I hate it bible care.
Yummy
Looks delicious I will definitely make this recipe thank you 🇨🇦
Where do you get the wok l love ❤ 😍
Looking delicious  Thanks for sharing
Thank you - just found you/your recipe.  I've just cooked this using leftover chicken, rice and vege and it is delicious!  Nice and easy. I previously had my own way of cooking chicken fried rice but your method is simple and quick.  (the leftovers will keep me going over the weekend).  Thank you again. Love from NZ.
Some cashews would go well with this.
Wow. Thank you
LOVE IT!!!!! 🔥👊🔥
THIS is asian mother fried rice...
Is there a cheat code where every women could sound like her😂
If Uncle Roger saw this he would say "Vegetables taste like sad, but frozen it tastes like depression"
Thank you so much for sharing your knowledge.  I tried this recipe for the first time. It is perfect,  simple and delicious 😋 😍.  Success!!!!!!!
Simple n easy😋😋
Nice video. Quick question how come you don't use the wok that you have forsale? The one on Amazon? Cheers
Your personality is just so cute! Such a doll you are! Gonna go make some fried rice now. Thank you for your video!
Thnx so much !! Can’t wait to  try it
Hi, I have a question. What type of vegetable oil do you use? Just curious.
что-т острое
I just used your recipe but added a little of my own things to it… and I’ll NEVER order chicken fried rice from a restaurant if I don’t have too again! Thank you!!
Wow! Made it and it’s amazing!!
Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe
My partner and I are currently sick with the flu, and I literally can’t stop thinking about how tasty this looks 🤤 Can’t wait to try it when we’re better!
👍👍👍🇺🇲
KISS keep it simple stupid, you did a wonderful breakdown thank you so much
I'm a day late but thank you young lady
No, please!! No peas or carrots 😤
Isn’t dark soy sauce or duck soy sauce
Anyone from the New England area?  I can chef/cook all types of Asia dishes and will try this but it’s as though once settlers pass NY, they started making rice, egg roll (spring out here) and lost the original recipe which is common in the new England states. Char Su taste though out but there is a vegetable sauce that some mom and pop Chinese use (again, in New England tri-states).   Additionally being in CA I’ve grown accustom to Indonesian (add shrimp or fish paste, kathup Manis (sweet soy=soy, brown sugar, star anise and garlic, or just purchase).   The egg rolls at  Genghis Khan taste close but are missing all the green mushrooms.    Just wondering.  I
I'm 53 years old and I've been trying to make chicken stir fry rice on multiple occasions and it never worked out. I watched your video once, then went through it again to make it and it turned out delicious!!!  Thank you!  And I love your cheerful demeanor!
I made this recipe, but with shrimp and it turned out perfectly.  It is such an easy recipe to follow.  I thought it was going to taste horrible, but it was pleasantly tasty.  It tasted just like the restaurant.  Thank you so much for the Chinese secret 🙂
I know this is probably a stupid question, but can you make this dish in a cast iron skillet?  So basically do I have to have a wok?
Cut back on oil, make to greasy
My sister has been trying to do stir fry but it's far far to salty for my taste buds,what is making it so salty. She uses fish sauce,light soy and dark soy
Can i use a frying pan to cook it
Amazing show thank you for sharing. Have a great day
Baking powder or soda?
Hey,  thank you very much for your recipe I tried it today and that fried rice was delicious the only thing is I use shrimp instead of chicken.  I'm going to use chicken the next time thank you so much and be safe.
the meal came out perfectly and I can't get enough of it! lovely video :)
I think I just found the first meal to make in my new apartment. This looks so damn good!
Thank you so much for sharing this recipe, I just made it and it was perfect.
1  Cook chicken with seasoning “after take out”  2 Cook eggs after done cooking add to the chicken  3  Frie rice add chicken add peperr
But does it have Wok hei?
I ryka yu!! Seriously. This is great thank you for sharing!! 👍
Lady, I love your accent!
hello    souped up     recipes    saying  your   fried   rice    smells  like poo from the back side     but they don't  say that  to Subaru   chinese  shop in Mt barker south Australia
You made this simple and sweet. I am definitely subscribing to your channel. Thanks… Simplicity is the best policy, I like it. Keep up the great work young lady!!!
Wow this making me hungry. I'm going need too make this for sure thank you for sharing your cooking videos ❤️
THIS IS DELICIOUS 😋
Fuiyoh!!
0:33 nice shot👌
why do you use tsp for tablespoon and teaspoon
One question. Do you add to chicken baking powder or baking soda.? You mentioned both
Amazing!!! Yum just made it and omggggg!!! So good.
Like if you're here because of Uncle Rodger
Wow amazing video thank you God bless great information
Baking powder, or baking SODA??
Welchen Reis verwendest du ?!
Yummy looks so good 💚💚💚
What about beef frie rice..
Personnaly,i like chicken fried rice particularry when it s cooked with green peas,fried eggs,sesame oil and green onions,but whitout oyster sauce.
I came looking for a recipe similar to one a Thai student taught me. And this is the same.  Wonderful recipe.  It's dinner tonight.
what brand of soy sauce?
It looks very Yummy Sweetie, that's the best friend Rice I've seen so far on Utube. Thank you for Sharing your awesome recipe.
looking nice 😋😋🇯🇲
The meet technique to keep it moist works far better then expected. Great recepie, family ate it all up. Thank you so much for the video.
Française sans traduction je ne peux comprendre
Love your videos. So straightforward, no fuss and easy to follow.
looks like peas not green beans ... looks tastee, good tip about oyster sauce, I agree
runde grüne Bohnen nennt man auch Erbsen 😂😂
Yummy tummy delicious
Great video. I do the same steps. Thank you for sharing!
I think is so much salt in the recipe, 2 kinds of soy sauce (that is so salty) , and add more sal at the end...
These are green peas right ? Not green beans> looks yummy cooking tonight, thanks
Mmmmmmm that looks good!!! I will try tonight
Where's the msg at?
My great niece and I make it often.  It's a very favorite of hers, and she likes mine best.  She's had it all over the country so that's saying something.  Or she just loves me.  She eats enough to burst!
Sesame oil and fresh ginger is fab in any stir fry and along with the rest of this recipe
Good evening, thank you for sharing your recipe. My brother and I will follow your steps, and hopefully create a delicious meal like yours.   Greetings from Mauritius island.
Je fais comme vous. Tanks
Why do i torment myself so much watching cooking videos?  Oh that looks so Yum!!!!!!!!!
OMG!!! This looks soo good!!!
Just made this but added finely chopped potatoes 🔥
Looks absolutely marvelous
It looks good, but too much salt and too much vegetable oil is bad for the heart. How do I know I’ve had heart problems of late.  Better off using virgin oils.
Looks delicious !
Suddenly I feel like fried chicken rice! Great recipe, thanks
It looks deeeeeeelicious !
me dio hambre
She’s the cutest lol
Fishermen never say that the fish is bad
How much cooked rice? It doesn’t say?
The color is amazing!
What came first? chicken or the egg ?
That looks delicious  🇦🇺🌺❤️
One spoon of dark soy is more than enough
Another mistake: You said to ad green beans...but you show adding green peas. Also it is more correct to say that the chicken has been sear...not burned.
This is why Chinese take out is so heavy! Oil oil oil. I love this nice lady's recipe. She is adorable also. I will try to minimize the oil as much as possible. :) Thank you for the recipe! :0
I add chopped Cilantro to my stir fried rice right at the end with the green onions, and it is THE BEST!
love it but no egg! I'm allergic!
薄口醤油大さじ1、濃口醤油大さじ2とテキストにはあるが、音声と映像では濃口は「小さじ2」こちらが正しいと思われる

Thank you, looks delicious, I wil try it.
I was glad to see she’s really cooking green peas, not green beans.
How much rice was this 1 cup?
Hi❤ plz subscribe my chanel 🌷 https://youtube.com/channel/UCVQNZmgULaLwRATLqAgB3hw
THANK YOU for getting me STARTED on Chinese Cuisine! I LOVE your recipes, and appreciate that you took the time to email years ago!
Mines wasn’t the best but I was proud of my lazy behind because I actually tried to do something productive on my summer break 😂 Great Tutorial girll 😆❤️✨
Green beans?  Those look like peas.
Thank you so much! Now I know where I’ve been going wrong!  I’ve been adding the egg directly to the rice, and it gets all mushy.  I’m not good enough to have thought about cooking the egg separate and adding it last. 🤦🏻‍♀️ how embarrassing for me!  I love cooking Chinese at home - it saves so much money! Thank you 🙏🏼 ❤️
Yummy and delicious thanks for this great video it really help for my channel godbless
Just made this and added jalapeños and radishes 🔥🔥🔥
You're telling me a chicken fried this rice??
You’re telling me a chicken fries this rice?
can’t wait to make this
I want to make it now but I don’t have time for day old rice. Does it really matter?
Oh man, I thought it was a new video, and wondered where all your fancy video lights and stuff had gone, lol
I Love Chinese fried rice and this looks amazing 😍
Thank you ❤
I love your recipes, but I’m one person, I wish someone would come up with recipes for singles.  I guess I’m lazy trying to pair down the recipe. Your wok is so well seasoned.  How do you make a new wok ready for cooking?
Thank you!!!! I used your simple strategy..Added crab meat, bacon pineapple sausage mix veggies & green onion..adding a table spoon butter to crab leg…delicious..slow cook then Finalize with a ten minute bake….DELICIOUS I tell ya
Okay... You need to put a text warning on there when you said, "baking power" I bought baking powder for nothing. and I don't have any baking soda, and there's no way i can get any this late in the day. I'M PISSED OFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Thank you!
I've followed this recipe multiple times. Have to say it is amazing! My family loves it. Thank you so much!!
That does look good. Will have to try it. Thank you 🙏🏻 for sharing
Made this tonight for my significant other. She loved it. Me too. Thank you for sharing the recipe :)
I think its too much salt
Just made it! It is delicious 😋...thank you!
i do not see green beans in this vidio but I see peas
I made this recipe for my family and they love it, they thought I bought this fry rice in a restaurant thank you
Too much salt and salty ingredients
No vegetable oil. I never use it. I save the grease from cooked meat. If I don't have that, butter
MMM IM IN MMM LAND AGAIN AND AGAIN THANKS TO YOUR RECOMMENDATION 😊 JUST SUBSCRIBED
Thank you for this cooking lesson. I've been wanting to make this. 🙂
DONT CUT MEATS ON A WOODEN BOARD O R PLASTIC
👀...👍🔥😎🔥👍
Saved this
Looks good 🙏🏽 I used to make this for my troops in the Army! They loved it! Close to same recipe but for 300 soldiers…🙏🏽🙋🏻‍♀️👍🏽Mia
Looks so good! And a budget meal, too!
Just made it tonight! Fantastic recipe. My local store didn't have light soy sauce (not the same as low sodium etc... Research it ... A lot of them don't even say light on it, you just have to know the label), but found that it could be substituted with aminos.  It tasted incredible.  I like learning methods and then tailoring it to my tastes, but the first time I do a recipe, I stick to the script.,. The only major difference is her green beans look more like peas to me... Green beans are typically in a pod (yes peas are too but you don't typically eat those pods)...  Can anyone tell me what the veggie was she used as "green beans"?
Thank you for video. Very easy to understand!
Love this stuff!
Wow. I just made this and YES it is REALLY good. I looked at several videos before deciding to try this. My first time making fried rice and everyone Loved it. Thank you!!! 🥰
I cooked this recipe today... absolute delicious
Success! This was a very good recipe and style to cook it. The chicken turned out very tender and juicy. I remember my old boss used to prepare the chicken in the restaurant this way but I wasn't sure of his exact formula. Now I have a good idea. Thanks for the wonderful tips! I was depressed today and cooking something fun that turned out well cheered me up a lot. My cat Mei Ling was also happy because he got a piece of chicken!
I make this easy tested great thanks
Most uninspiring recipe ever bet that tasted so bland just salt
I see I see You make it with pegao No wonder it tastes awesome
Thanks for sharing this recipe with us .😊
There is literally half a litre oil in that dish
Best cooking videos on YouTube
What a darling recipe.
Oh gosh so good. Can I adopt you.? You are by far the cutest cook. Thank you it was delicious.
chee row chow fan = chicken fried rice my ex wife was Chinese
Who the hell eats fried Rice with a spoon 🙅🏾🙅🏾🙅🏾
Looks good but I add bacon and only use green onion. A bit of sesame seed oil?
THNAK YOU sincerely!
Looks super delicious 😋 must try it.
My fiance and I made this recipe, and it's Sooooo Delicious 🤤 We couldn't stop eating it. I had to pack the food away before I finished my bowl. Otherwise, I would have rolled out the kitchen. So easy, so simple. 🙌🏽 #AutomaticSubscription.
I've eaten this once a week for last 2 years....I swap the chicken for salmon sometimes.  Thanks for the great simple recipe.
I do trust you ! Madam ! Fresh vegetables are way better way.... I never like to see frozen peas or carrots in my Chinese take away..but sadly it often is.
You have a very sweet calming voice👍🏾
Enjoyed your video. I have recently tried several Chinese recipes. The experience was amazing with great taste.
Wonderful... I just cooked it - nowhere near as good as you, but good enough. Thanks. 😁👍❤️
How was that rice prepared the day before?  Am a clueless student so need baby steps
What type of rice did you use please?
You said baking powder first then baking soda, which is it???
Fasting Better than Eating for Strength ...Jesus⚓
Needs msg! Uncle Roger would be so mad!
Is baking powder and baking soda the same? What's the measurement for the rice and chicken?
I followed your recipe, the result was the most amazing Fried Rice, thank you.
I want to marry this woman😅😅
New sub! This looks amazing and going to make it tonight! Yum
💖Your greeting of "Hello everyone!" makes me smile every time! I also enjoy watching you eat what you made!  🙂👍💯👍
It is okay she just talk to much
what a nice and friendly lady, makes me want to watch the video till the end and make the food, she makes it sound so good, and thank God no irritating music and unnecessary long drawn out silences while the batter is being stirred
Does not take 15 minutes to cook if you need to marinate your chicken for thirty minutes before you start ! Also is better with chicken thigh meat !!
Ma'am, you had me a chicken
I’m Confused!! She said baking powder but then said baking soda tendorizes it… so which does she really want us to use??
Sharpen your knife :/
You say add a punch of baking powder then talk about how baking soda tenderizes the chicken. I have both but don’t know which one you meant?
Too much oil
So funny !!!! Thanks! Chinese people always have cooked rice, the rest have to boil some rice first. Where are the green beans 🤤🤤🤤
You are so funny and great at the same time. Thanks for the video. I need to check them all out!!! Love it!
Looks yummy
thank you for teaching me how to cook.
I have made a million different recipes. But yours is THE BEST.  EVERY SINGLE TIME💖💖
Love your recipes the best! I’m making pork rice tonight but I couldn’t find your recipe so I’m using your chicken one. I had my pork in the freezer & made it from a roast pork recipe & it came out good! I made my rice today but I’m using your trick & it’s drying in the fridge now. Thanks so much for teaching me! Luv ya!🌸
Just love her attitude! How fun!
I didn’t think this had much flavor.  What did I do wrong?  How could I improve it?
I gave you a thumbs up for your cuteness!
I made this and the chicken was so good! Thank you !
We don’t need an new virus mam so no thanks for recipes
I've never been crazy about fried rice, but I'll make an exception for this recipe. This actually looks really good and flavorful. I'll try it.
Fantastic dish by a fantastic presenter .
Merci pour cette recette et certainement que j’en ferai d’autres 🥰
Ce riz chinois est absolument délicieux! C’est le meilleur riz que j’ai mangé et je vais certainement en refaire encore. Mon mari et moi avons adoré. 🥰😍🥰
GREAT LOVE TO ALL.
What is the rice name please?
too much use of oil
Thank you much for the simple recipe 😌
I made this but used brown rice and chicken thighs. This recipe was simple and tasted incredible. Thank you for sharing this was everyone ❤️.
I made this recipe once again, with a little improvisation. It came out as promised- perfect! Thank you for doing these recipes, very well done.  谢谢。
My kids love your recipes! The sesame chicken was their favorite!
👍🏻👍🏻
Your Soy Sauce looks really rich and thick.  I have been making fried rice for years.  Only recently came across recipes that include garlic.  I will give this a try.
👌
I like how she samples her food after she cooks 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Hungary now
Stop posting videos in full caps lock...
“Humans are good but damn this is also good too!!”
GOOD JOB!
Hey, why do my veggies: green beans, carrots and peas always end up in a mashed up paste? Yours always look beautiful and untouched. I try to be careful not to mash them but it always happens?
Why the hell is this in a jacksepticeye playlist???
I wish I had a Chinese girlfriend.
Is that the rice that's already cooked rice or can I use the rice in the bag that have to be cook
They key for good fried rice is using the rice from the day before kept in the fridge and don't use too much sauce. Bean shoots are also a great addition near the end.  Try not to use too much oil.
So you never have oyster sauce in this dish? I always make it with Oyster sause, a bit of fish sauce, sesame oil and then also thai soy sauce which is lighter I guess and also a bit of the chinese darker one.
I trust you,  but I am lazy American
Great recipe. Thank you❤️
This was delish!!!!!! Thank you
Mmm, just the Vegetables.
All thanks to Dr Aluda on YouTube for curing my hpv with his holistic herbs.
Use coconut oil instead of vegetable oil. Thank me later.
Fell asleep whatchin horror movies an wake up ta dis....
Great video, but why use those cup-measurements? It doesn't make sense. Do you mean Australian cups? Or maybe a UK cup? It's unclear. Just use grams. It's precise and clear. Everybody knows what's up. I don't get it when non-native 'Americans' use cups as measurements. It's like going back in time. Thanks for the recipe!
You did an excellent job on this video. Like the other person commented, no annoying background music, just you narrating your recipe step by step.... great job!
Looks awesome
WHAT KINDA RICE DID U USE
Ohh yes,💯 I love this fried rice recipes of yours, absolutely fantastic 👏👏& thanks for this great sharing, yum 😋🥰👍👍👌
I wouldn't add any more salt other than the soy sauce. Looks insanely high in sodium with her version.
It looks great you did a beautiful job doing this vidio
Funny how your opinion has changed lol your most recent stir fry video you said FROZEN is the best veggies, here you said fresh. Haha😉. I use frozen since it's less work
Can I use potato starch rather than corn?
Ingenious recipe. Thank you so much <3 Must try it one day (with a twist of course :))
So much Oil...
What type of rice did you use?
Where your MSG???
Where is the msg?!
Do you have a good recipe for turnip cake?
what rice she used?
Just made this. BOMB!
Thank you for sharing it looks good 👍🏽
your an excellant chef, i want to marry you
Going to make it today. Have day old rice. . But will.be using frozen veggies. Best wishes from New Zealand.
Uncle Roger says, where's the MSG LOL.  Otherwise looks good!
Where do you get the spring onions? This looks really good!😃😃😃😃😃😃
Love it! I want to try it 😍
Can I use uncooked rice instead of cooked rice for the fried rice ?
Wow looks good!
Thank q for another great recipe!!
mouth watering! thank you
You're a great cook with a ton of great recipes, but you're also totally adorable. I swear to god it makes me smile just hearing you talk about the food
Beautiful fry rice I have ever come across. Thank you very much for your recipe
baking soda or baking powder?  you called it by both names.
What if you dont have that type of oven? I got the digital kind
Great dish thank you
My first time ever make chicken fried rice. I loved how easy it was to do thanks so much for the recipe.❤️
You killed that
I love and crave most Chinese food.  This looks like such good fried rice,and I will be trying it!
I have always wondered about the day old rice used for fried rice.  Do you keep over night in the refrigerator?  Room temperature?  Other?  Many thanks!
is it ok if its white onion?
I can’t find hardly any of the Chinese ing.here! Guess I gotta go online.
This was dope...and fast!
I will copy you now
God damn this looks good!
Great recipe!!
Thanks! Great video.
What kind of rice is it?
I do not like scorch eggs..but great recipe
I have the wok from your channel! 8t is so lovely for cooking these dishes!
lovely video!  i'm making this tonight!!!   EDIT - I DID make this tonight.  It IS better than takeout!!!  New subscriber :)
Thank you, :3
I’m so satisfied
We make this fairly often. Our little tip is oyster sauce and sesame oil along with soy sauce. Hits a higher flavor profile. Thanks for the recipes
You forgot the MSG
I failed terribly.  My end result was mushy and yuk.  Not remotely sure why, but I'm sticking to restaurants. 😪
Nailed it ;)
Can i swap the chicken in this recipe for prawns?
Seems nice dear, thank you! Allow me to share my experience, I love to put also what I can find in the fridge, but with carrots change the flavor!
Takes 15 minutes to cook. LOLOLOL. Awesome food. Awesome video, But does not take 15 minutes. 🤣
Currently trying to make this. Will update on how it turned out (sadly i don't have dark soy sauce)
Sweet Girl, I am addicted.
Thank u i will do it tomorrow I hope it will heal my psychic wounds
Nice recipe,  looks so delicious, Thanks you for sharing.
Love fried rice easy to make and taste good.
So delicious food
gotta love fried rice
https://youtube.com/c/pavanKumarRajputboyTP
Baking powder or baking soda? Or is that the same thing?
That makes me hungry
You don't put sesame oil in your cooking but this is usually used in most chinese takeway restaurants.
Going to make this tomorrow ❤️
very nice
I tried this recipe today and my fried rice turned out sooooo good thank you
I have watched this video so many times and have yet to make my chicken fried rice this way, I am going to do it this way this weekend. Do I have to use corn starch? And can I use meat tenderized instead of baking powder? Other than that...I will be following your instructions in the video. I just may add extra onions because I LOVE extra onions in my fried rice. I hope to get a response before Saturday 12/18/21
that's not how to make fry rice. You miss the most crucial part which is a gas stove to create the wok hei
The fact that you are so obsessed with this recipe is why I am making it for the very first time today. :)
I have been experimenting with a few recipes recently and there is LOTS of good here. I personally like to add oyster sauce to mine.
I made vegetable fried rice yesterday but I didn't know one could use vegetable oil instead I was using butter, soy sauce and little of sesame oil for the frying basis, vegetables I used is broccoli, cauliflower, corn, asparagus, onion(I used frozen except for corn & onion) I scrambled eggs set apart, same for veggies then for the rice I add a bit of oyster sauce I stir-fry it for a bit then add everything together stir for a bit then serve smelled & tasted like from the store.
Yummy 😋 😋 😋 😋
What kind of rice do they use at the Chinese restaurants? It's not that sticky. Looks good
Wow! The Chicken Friend Rice tastes great and was simple to make! Thank you!
Delicious! So easy to make. I learned the value of good prep! Thank you 😊
I think you are so cute!  And you explain things very well! I bought your wok today!
I was always curious on how this is made!
❤️
This is exactly how I like my fried rice  Color an everything.. looks tasty af lol
Adding oyster sauce as well makes it soooo much better
Thank you ❤️❤️❤️
I Love U !!!!
Did it for dinner tonight and did exactly how the video showed and it turn out awful the rice was so sticky it definitely wasn’t your normal fried rice absolutely horrible and a waste of time and food!!
Simple, easy, clear and no wasted time with nonsense.  Well done!  Thanks!
Looks delicious, going to give this recipe a try. Except I don't want to cook the egg too long, I don't want brown color on my eggs,  that is a flavor I don't like. So I will cook the egg for less time, or I will mix egg yolks and coat rice with egg yolks before cooking the rice.
Made this and it was perfection. Thanks for this recipe.
Do you have a chicken and broccoli Recipe comparable to take out
I'm going to add salmon with the chicken 😍😍😍
Literally making this now. Quick tip, make your rice BEFORE everything else
I made this for the boss, my wife, and she loved it. The chicken tip you gave I used and it was perfect. I love to cook and you have taught me, at 65, how to make perfect chicken fried rice. Thank you!
Very delicious thank you
that look good!🙃
great food prepared by a stunning lady...wow
That's how the bay area rice look. Hella good too
I could eat this everyday 🤤🤤🤤🤤
Thaaaank you!
I made this today. & omg it was so delicious!!! Thank you for this recipe
Just made this.. it’s SOOOOooOoOoo GoOOoOoOod. Now I can’t stop eating it 😩😩😩
I’m gonna make this thank you
Looks yummy, thank you for sharing that recipe
Do wok work on regular stove top?
So good thanjs for sharing✌🤗💞
I just made this , it cam out good but wanted it to tase more like take out. I had trouble finding Dark and light Soy sauce , maybe that’s why? But for the most part it tasted so good!.
I didn’t use egg but still good
Your spoon is bigger than your head lol 😂
Can confirm comes out amazing as all hell worth a try
What if I don’t have dark soy sauce
When I added the chicken, the oil started splashing a lot 😳. What did I do wrong 😑
I just cooked fried rice last night and it was meh. I should’ve watched this before I try cooking it
I love this
My mouth is just watering looking at the food😂 can’t wait to try this for dinner tonight
Uncle Roger would be proud and happy.
How many people does this serve? I can't see it anywhere. Going to make it. Thank you!!
Excellent!!!😀
So cool
why is this in the jackspeticye visage plays list
I just got a $36 wok and egg sticks to mine :(
Yeah it’s not better than takeout though. Can’t get that smoky flavour at home like in takeouts .
I fail at rice . I hope I can make this. I have minced garlic in a jar. Should I use that or chop my ownTY
Looks good to me
is it baking soda or baking powder? First she says baking powder and next she said baking soda!!
How many meals of the dish does this recipe make?
Watching this while my fish sticks bake
Chicken the Chinese, the Chinese chicken….   Hey Macarena!!!   Alright.!!! 😜🤘🏻👌🏻
Awesome thank you !
Food look very delicious
New subscriber is here watching
Did you rinse the excess starch from the rice prior to cooking?
4:59
Its good
Instead of vegetable oil you should add olive oil or coconut oil
I like your recipe…..and I like your accent.
hope more youtubers cut out the excess talking like you did, you just delivered what was required.
All this is is soy rice.use precooked rice with half  up oil in pan .every Chinese in new York from China does it.you can see it's wrong it's more brown then yellow.egg is nasty fried rice
great looking
I love how you have video instructions AND written instructions with the measurements on the side! Easier to follow. 😀
I’m cooking for 5 so I added chicken and shrimp 🍤 🤤
Wait the rice was already cooked when you put it in the wok? And if you don’t have a wok what do I use? A pan?
Thank you for the recipe. I didn't measure since I only had a tiny bit of leftover Jasmine rice, but you showed it very simply and step by step so it came out great. & I did it asian style by using what I had in the fridge. Thank you! <3
yo i tried this and the rice came out black and crispy........
This has been a staple for me this year.
All the recipies I've seen never explain how to cook the rice grains, they just have the rice already 😞
Damn! 😍
This is the best recipe I've found because it's so simple she literally only used soy sauce
Ain't no way she finishing that bowl...
We eat this dish here when we have leftover rice and lazy to cook curru
I always thought sesame oil was a key to fried rice but honestly the last 3 videos I’ve seen, no one has used it 😂 some Asian chefs have used fish sauce though but no more sesame for me.. not even as a garnishing oil
Holy moly this is amazing ..
What no sesame oil ?
Have done limited Chinese cooking but seeing these videos I now will do more. Thank you!
Jeusss- - - -Damnnn - - -Never seen food look so Orgasmic 😭😭😭😭💔💔💔😭😭😍😍😍😍Lao Shisssssssssshhhhhhhhhhhhh
just made this and its amazing!!!
I wish i was in your household my mom just makes normal rice
Thanks for the recipe..
Nice video 👍👍👍😋😋😋 , I tried it out on my YouTube channel @ Hans kitchen . You can pass by
Does anyone know that first black knife?  Thanks
The texture too wet, not for me
YESS😋😋😋😋😋😋
Great job!! When I try doing fried rice at home it never tastes like the one from a restaurant! I will follow your recipe next time for sure!! Is there anything else the restaurant adds to give it that special unique taste? Like; fish sauce/sesame oil/ginger/hoisin sauce/msg??? Thank you!!
Tasty looking, what kind of rice did you use!
Am making this tomorrow,love ❤️ it
I have watched this video so many times and every time I see it I make the recipe....it is without a doubt the best fried rice with chicken or shrimp you can make..and easy to do...Thanks again.......Great cook.....
she's closing in on a well-earned 1 million subscribers... (posted Octber 2021)

Thank you for teaching me this recipe, I like putting in shrimp as well..

Thanks for your recipe.  It would be nice to hear the sound of the cooking, nothing like watching a cooking show an hearing the sound of sizzling, chopping, mixing,etc.😉
Its 2 am and I feel Hungry
Why would anyone dislike this video?
I went into an asian market asking for dark soy sauce. They did have it but the lady told me it was the same as the light soy sauce I already had. Dark soy sauce for the color. Is that true? Not talking about the thicker and more aged ones.. I heard those tend to be sweeter?
I made this again tonight. My husband says thank you for the recipe its very good! I have made several of your recipes and truly enjoy your channel. Thank you.
Wait, don’t you take the rank out of the egg yolks.
U need sounds love.
What type of rice is that?
I love Asian foods T__T
I need a Wok
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😊😊😊😊
Aww bless your heart, i love your accent & your so cute 🥰 Thanks for this recipe, im always buying this from the Chinese restaurant up the road, but now I'm gonna try & make it on my own haha Save me loads of money :) x
Did someone tried to make this? I wanted to try it but i don't like egg in this food. Did u liked it? 🙄
Can you heat it up the next day and if so what is the best way to eat it up??
Chinese are great at making fried rice and the virus
0:38 what type of soya sauce? dark or light soya sauce?
This is an awesome recipe I  really enjoyed it. Thank you for sharing.
Very  nice..thank you
You are so adorable!!
Hello thank you for the recipe... I just put lesser salt
I made this and it was so delicious I didn't have carrots and I used baking soda n a little baking powder instead of corn starch which I didn't have. I love it
I should not have watched this video right before going to sleep.....I know what I'll have dreams about !!!
Is the rice pre-cooked or something?
Can you please write the weight also in grams? In Europe we don't use cups and tablespoons 😭
no ginger?
what kind of rice and how do you prepare it?
What kind of rice do you use? Thank you

Damnnnnnnn….made for the family and we all loved it!! Great recipe!!
This recipe is perfect
Rice very sticky
Omg it was so yummy
Hello, I tried it and surprisingly it was the BEST, Really the Best. BETTER Than Take Out 4real. I enjoy your videos. Thanks keep up the 😋 work
Yam yam
I came from an enviroment in which asian food is rare and expensive. Since I didn't try it before, my expectations for this recipe were incredibly exceeded. I can't belive I lived so long without tasting such a delicious chicken.
I shouldn’t have watched this on my break
Looks really good imma try make this
What type of rice is best for this recipe?
Ohhh I love it a lot ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ it's sooo delicious😋✌
@mrnigelng ayaaa
Wow Yummy
where did you buy your wok thats the wok im looking for i love fried rice with vegetables and eggs yummy i tried already
Where do you get your wok
You are excellent very good 👍 I like you cooking
She said nice burnt marks on the chicken that’s what we like to see god tier cooking
not accurate
at the end you said there’s taste of garlic?  I didn’t see you put any garlic at all?
Uncle Roger watched, Uncle Roger approved
Add msg and sesame oil  to make it even better
You are adorable ♥️♥️♥️
Can I use regular rice for this dish?
No MSG?! Hai-yaaa!!
It’s good as is.  But you are lacking some butter, sesame seed oil, and a chicken bullion cube.   Add in those and it hits another level up.
Why didn't you add that hoisen sauce
I’m getting ready to do this meal tomorrow❗️😋
For one yank lady your a very good cook this is very good thank you love 🌈🦘🐨🇦🇺🙏😉
WOW!!  Nice recipe.  I'll try this for sure.  Looks good and I know it taste good as well.  Thanks for sharing.

Looks great. I think I need an amazing wok like yours in order for it to come out right.
Fuiyoh!
I’m surprise you don’t have spare tires around your waistline line many other cooks.
*YOU CHEATED ME!! I cooked the rice exactly as you said and it tastes like shit. It looks good but tastes horrible.*
Can you use 5 minute instant rice?
The fried chicken, taste so good when I eat with the Delta Parole music on blast the fried chicken is love fried chicken is life.
Good lob! Ty…….
I absolutely LOVE fried rice. My favorite, thanks love, this will come in handy for me. Thank you.

Looks great, thanks. I'm about to try my first fried rice.
2:17 HUNEY YOU CAN POACH THOSE CHICKEN BREAST CUBES ( LAST LONGER ) THANKS MATE

You made this look so easy! I am totally making this ASAP!
My all time favourite receipe from chicken fried rice🥰👌🏼we used to go to restaurant for these yummy rices but now I always cook it myself and everyone at home loves it also my kids 😍I shared this with my whole family ☺️😇so easy and especially yummy my kids… i cooked it already for above 10 times and will cook it tomorrow for lunch as well ☺️ Thanks for sharing dear! Greetings from a cooking-lover from Germany  🇩🇪 🙅🏻‍♀️
سويتها لذيذه جدا 😋
When you were actually adding the ingredients to the chicken (in the beginning), you said you were adding  baking POWDER but then talked about the benefits of using baking SODA in the chicken. Which one did you use?
Very well presented. Great confidence. And I have all the ingredients🇦🇺🤠👍 I’m subscribing🙏
I made this rice and it was so delicious.Thanks for your recipe.
if you put the chicken in first you dont have to take anything out and put in all the time. chicken first, vegatables into the wok, then garlic and then egg then rice
I made this but with extra veggies and mushrooms added!
We've always had trouble making good fried rice at home. I made it this way and it tasted great - the best ever.
And you said green beans!!!!!
Recipe says green beans,but you used peas,ha,id prefer peas anyways!!!!
Yummy
Me dio hambre , lo voy a intentar. Saludos desde Guadalajara, Jalisco Mexico
Yum, leftover rice nice tip...
Thanks so much for the recipe 😁
1:03
I watched her egg fried rice video Once...       Now, I'm a genius at home made prawn fried & egg fried rice with half a garlic bread on the side.  Thank you for making quick straight to point, not drawn out for 15mins videos.. I am humbly your student to learn more.
This is lovely
This turned out really delicious and authentic. Thank you for this tasty recipe ❤️
This is one of the best recipes on YouTube. My fried rice is now up to Benihanna level.
I hate to see Asian people eat.
What kind of rice do you use?
Fried rice for rewarthang kom, khupmhunsong kom n Eunice kom
She says baking soda the second time but she really meant to say baking powder
Just want to say thank you 😁🤙
This is different from your other fried rice recipe in which  you added dark soy sauce and oyster sauce. Why the change?
I know you probably wont see this but is it okay to marinade the chicken overnight?
I bet it tastes like dookie.
To much salt u added twice soy sauce has enough salt
Literally took me 2 hours to make
Can't wait to try this
Thank you 🙏 😍😎
You can definitely use same day rice or even freshly made rice, it just won't be as deliciously crispy! But still a great meal!
Hi, looks tasty. You didn't use fish sauce?
I'm doing a no carb diet... think it's time for a cheat day 😂😂 to go with your chicken and broccoli recipe 😋 youre the best
Love it
That spoon is beautiful
@1:08... beat drop
👍👍👍👍👍
I might have to get me a chinese woman😂 Green peas* here in USA
It looks so good. Can is use oyster sauce instead of dark soy sauce?.
Love how you explain in detail!!!
This is the first time ive watched a cooking video and was able to sit down and eat what was made! Lol
بموت جوع🥲
¡Delicious!🥰👏
how many tablespoons of MSG do I dump in this??
Ok you can cook but what that mouth do thougggghhhhhh
Yummmmmmmie
Is it baking powder or baking Sosa??
Great video, very informative, clear and easy to understand. Thank you.
I made it and it came out perfect.no more take out for me :)
Legend is she ate the whole bowl in one sitting!
So much oil and salt !!!
Looks delicious
Thank you
I followed this recipe and just add some different tweaks but mostly same way of cooking and my my it came out so yummy I wasn’t hungry just wanted a taste ended up eating whole plate once u eat u just wanna keep eating that how much delicious it was thanks for sharing also you’re videos one the best not music and u explain everything so well
you accent so cute :)
I haven't subscribed to a channel in over 5 years lol... today I broke that streak.
It is ok.  It's like my fried rice. But taste better if you add 1 or 2 tbsp of oyster sauce before you add the egg. Basmati rice is better and use olive oil. Adding Ham or bacon is nice too. Chopped capsicum is nice too before adding the fried egg .
Thank you.  I'm learning to cook gluten free for my daughter.  Fried rice was one of her favorites that we can no longer get from a restaurant. She should love this one.
Didn't have any noodles or rice to do that so tried this with pasta and turned out great!!! Thanks 😀
Wow,  I have never heard a Chinese person say "Oh my God" Before!
FANTASTIC !!!!!  I love love your Channel !!!!  Thank You.........
Thank you so much for this! I thought my rice was missing something and I think its the garlic
Just made it and wow best one so far yum yum x
To much oil
Thank you! I followed this recipe and the family loved it.
Brilliant video one of the tastiest special fried rice I made.
i made this bcos i was bored and my mom always be telling me that i gotta learn how to cook, so i did this and my whole family loved it, when they make family reunions now they ask me to cook this
Is it baking soda or baking powder? Please clarify
This is a simple and tasty recipe.  I made it today came out - delicious! Actually this is the 3rd time over the last (say) 6 months that I have followed this recipe. Great results every time. Thank you
So yummy
I don't use day old rice anymore because a Chinese chef said "Don't do that you'll never make the best stir fried rice" So I stopped and he was right :-)
Okay, now I have to get a wok.  That looks delicious!  Also, super easy.  Tfs!
It’s 9:00pm right now and just decided to boil some rice now to make it tomorrow 😂 I love fried rice! 😍
So hungy
It looks delicious. No chance it would come out like that for me 🤔. I am lost in the kitchen.
Fabulous fried rice ever we followed your instructions to the tee and wow was it great. You may wanna change in your description green beans to green peas great recipe thank you very much
Thank you. I eat Chinese food like I'm half Chinese. That's because I have traveled to China so many times and ate lots of delicious Chinese food that I love. Beef fried rice is my favorite. Thanks for the video. I will try to cook this food. I just need to find some time to cook. Bye, Joe
Yami thank you
I like your recipes. You don't add more sugar to any of your recipes. Thank you 😊 💓
loooks good but das a little 2 much soy sauce for my taste
Can't wait to try this recipe. I've tried several recipes from several cookbooks and they all seemed to missing the restaurant quality fried rice flavor.  Thank you for posting this.
Made this recipe multiple times already it's great!
I am definitely very hungry! Great job!
Add a pinch of msg
Why cook the egg first to sit and get dry?
you put cornstarch  on the chicken but at 51 seconds on the video you said baking soda tenderizes it.  help.  which one is it?  I like your recipe.
Are we gonna talk about how big her spoon is 😂
I made this tonight & its the BEST fried rice ive ever made! Like you said, "better than take out!" Thx🙏🏾😋❤
SouthEastAsia consumption level of salt leaves me speechless
I made this last night, and my husband and I loved it! Thank you for the recipe. It was easy to make with your instructions.
Love your Chinese recipes!
Thank you for posting!   Chinese restaurant fried rice is insanely expensive nowadays!  It’s so much cheaper to make it at home.  Your videos are a godsend!
I've made fried rice before and it was good. I didn't use a wok though. I'm getting a wok! 😀
It was, indeed, better than take out. Thanks, it was delicious!
Your the best💘
I love you! Come and live with me❤
i feel i need to roll over on my back to finish
Sit down and eat!
OK, OK!!!!!!  No need to bend my arm any further!  THIS is dinner TONIGHT!!!  Thank you!
That little girl had the biggest spoon with the biggest bowl of fried humanly consumable. Probadly comatose with carbohydrate high for three days.
This fried rice tastes REALLY GOOD!!!
Please tell me how sum restaurant get that SMOKE flavors in special fried rice
I became a Muslim and I could no longer find that nice halal Chinese rice and it’s such a struggle. I’m craving it so much. Thanks for the recipe really, I will definitely try it🥺😭 this is one of my favourite foods and I also love the black Chinese ear shape mushrooms, but idk how to cook them or where to find them as well 😭
I could eat it everyday
At 0:42 you say 'baking powder', then a few seconds later you say 'baking soda', which is different. I'm pretty sure you meant to say 'baking soda' both times, just making sure. Edit: I just read the description... it is, in fact, 'baking soda'.
very tasty thank you 😊❤️
Uncle Rodger? #TAGHIM
1:07 I thought that was the bottom of the wok 😂😂😂
So much OIL is used here
Thank you for writing out the ingredients and directions as well.  Very helpful.  :)
So gooood very healthy
How is it you can cook so many kinds of dishes at your young age ? I am sure you are graduate and teaching cooking is one your passion. I can't find your name in your channel.
Hi, what kind of wok u using?
Thank you. It looks great I’m going to make it.
There is NO way carrots are soft after 3 min of frying, absolute rubbish, they would still be rock hard..lol
Thank you so much I am a big fan of Chinese food and all
Hmmmm it smells so good
Thank you amazing
What kind of rice have u used?
YUMYUMYUM you make amazing food
There is a bit of prep involved, but it is delicious once you make it...
amazily lol
Great recipe but I didn't like the orgasm-like sounding voice towards the end.
Wow I love it..Can I use fresh old rice ?
Looks so good
Which type and brand of rice is best for this?
I made your recipe today and turned out so yammyyyyyyy thanks for sharing.
I made it and I like no sorry I love it
I been subscribed to you sweetie   ❤
Oh yes, another favorite of mine, with the Kikkoman's teriyaki on it.  Yummy  😋
I think I have made every amateur cook mistake there is so far. This was no different. My best advice is, know what weapons you have. That's hard to just say and not do but that's what I've learned. My burner, for example, gets way too hot on hi, or I let the sauce evaporate. Even paying attention and stirring every second, I still burn, under cook, or overdue the ingriedients. In this case I used 'Chinese sausage' and put to the side but still I burnt it. Haha. Awesome channel Mandy and will recommend it to anyone that wants to be as good as a pro at Chinese food. :)
So youre telling me a chicken fried this rice?
When u prepared everything an soya sauce is finish 😭😭😭
HIYAAAH.  use msg it king of flavah..
YES
You are Wonderful!
Shes such a cutey pie.  I really just watch to hear & see her adorable self...i love her feminine energy & i bet all her food tastes good....so rare in the west.  One critique though, id add a drizzle of sesame oil & premium oyster sauce at the end & a sprinkle of lee kum kee chicken powder earlier(but youll want to taste it before adding any salt).
I love the enthusiasm, can hear the excitement in her voice
Baking Soda or baking power
I just made this for me and my daughter. I doubled the recipe so I could have some for lunch tomorrow! So good! Thank you!
I make a bug wok of this every weekend and take it to work for lunch every day.  This recipe is so good, I’ve been eating it every day for lunch for the last few months and I still look forward to eating lunch every day even though it’s the same thing!!
bro imma cry do u guys not realize that she turned a like 200 cal fried rice into a like 1000 cal fried rice just because of the oil omg i cant but it looks soooo goooddd imma just not add that much oil lmao ok bai
so making thise
Is corn starch the same as corn flour
A little too much salt and oil for my tastes but it sure looks tasty!
Uncle Roger would say ‘Where is MSG?’ 😂😂😂😂
Awesome taste thank you for sharing 😀
https://youtu.be/pfjq946_MCU

When u love cooking but hate doing them dishes
https://youtu.be/pfjq946_MCU A fun song..chicken fried rice.
So is it baking powder or baking soda..?? 😐
She ever eat American food..?
I followed these instructions and used bbq rib meat for the protein.... FANTASTIC!  Thanks very much!
Thank you, this saved my marriage.
Thank you for your videos. I especially appreciate that you put everything in the description!!!
Baking powder or baking soda? You said both.
nice guirl thanks i love you
I was so close!  I just didnt separate everything. And didnt have a big enough pan.
I am so amazed! She cooks really good and seems to have good appetite for the foods she cook but still manage to stay so slim. I love her recipes!
I've tried your recipe!...... It was far more delicious!❣️....
Peruvian ARROZ CHAUFA 🌹
No ginger or sesame oil then? Are these ingredients not traditional?
Me reading: "it takes 15 minutes to make" Also me : taking 2h30 to actually make it ...
Way too much soy sauce for me. I prefer oyster sauce and sesame oil.
Excellent recipe, Thank you for doing a get to the point cooking video. You are a lovely woman, and I am sure you are interesting, but I am just trying to find a good recipe and you did it. I made this,  it was excellent. Thank you.
I like this recipe for chicken fried rice so far which is straight forward. The young lady showing us how to cook this dish does this very well with a pleasant personality and great skill.
I made this & it was excellent 😍
I just made for dinner thank u so much is so good
Thanks I’m 9 years old And I’m learning how to cook
Tried it, it’s AMAZING !
I like adding 2 cups of coleslaw mix for cabbage and carrots already done

excellent!  : )
what’s the best rice to use?
Setting raw chicken aside for 30 minutes?
Beautiful ❤️
Does anyone have a "recipe" for the red sauce Chinese restaurants serve with shrimp? I have been stalled at catsup, sugar, and sometimes a pinch of guar gum as a thickener. Any ideas???
Baking POWDER or baking SODA? I used SODA and its pretty tender Looking forward to do some of the other meat dishes too!
Family loved it! I didn’t add peas because I’m allergic and I used coconut aminos but it was really good!
I just made this and it was delicious! the best part is that it was super quick
Girlll :)) nice1, made it, loved it :))
"what you want is oil, next is oil. one more time add oil"

I made this tonight... it was yummy. Thanks for the recipe!
I love oyster sauce along with the other sauce she use and you don't need anymore salt after the sauce.

It's 3:21am and I am trying to figure out where I can find a wok pan and rice cooker. 😩
I gotta try this, it looks so good!!  Thank you much for sharing!
"Gotta get in the right mind frame"  5 years later, still watching not cooking 😂😂😂
That amount of vegetable oil will only go in system and choke the heart.
What kind of non stick layers is that?? It is not Teflon and doesn't look like it was seasoned with oil.  What is it?
Just made it and it is very good ! Thanks girl
Bbbb
where does the  covid sauce go ? On the side ?
Cutting chicken on a wooden board?  I dunno...
from where u get that pan
5  *****  stars  *****  5    excellent !!!

God that looks so good
Yummmm !!!!
I just got done making this its awe some i didnt have the baking soda or powder but is still good

What's the purpose of using dark soy sauce? Does it taste different or is it just for color?
It looks sooo good. Thanks for sharing.
Thanks I try it and it was delicious. Go check it out on the Pearson family  . Great video.
Is the rice pre boiled?
Ohhhhh,that looks gooood ! Ohhhh yeah,look at this Hmmmm,I'm so satisfied !! OMG. You are so funny !!!!
Made this for my family tonight and they all loved it.... thank you and GOD BLESS
All hands down, best recipe I have EVER made. It takes some time to master and I recommend that you have everything pre measured out so u can just grab and toss. But other then that it's pretty simple and a HUGE family favorite.
Ok. I"m going to try....
@ 4:59 🤣
THIS IS THE BEST RECIPE SO FAR.. THANK YOU FOR  SHARING..
Anyone know the difference between St. Louis fried rice and the rest of the USA fried rice? What make their rice taste better?
5.9 million people can't be wrong 😋
I love this recipe 😍. Amazing 🥰🤤🤤🤤❤️💯🐲
This Is So Dinner Tonight 😊
Too much dark soy and the egg is too thick. It should be wispy, there is a technique to do this. Source: born into an HK Chinese family owning 2 takeout stores in the UK so I worked in the kitchen since I was 14yo till I finished university at 22yo.
I like mine with Oyster sauce  too it's good 😋
Made this for dinner today...Delish!!!! Thanks for sharing!
* Jump,the Cook !
** Eat, the *COOK !
So easy and so gooooood , he he he , thanks
Looks so good.
Looks great, but I would take out the peas and carrots.
Imagine if uncle Roger react to it
@Azure  That is where you and most people are very wrong indeed!. In good Chinese restaurants the secret is using fresh warm steamed rice to make fried rice over hot heat so the rice maintains some moisture and does not dry out completely. As long as you do not over crowd the hot wok absolutely zero soggy rice . It is Perfection. Try it my friend you will thank me later I promise you top quality restaurant rice being not dry and definitely not soggy or mushy.this is the secret.. chicken stock powder, touch of oyster sauce, white pepper, salt , sugar.. Thai version as above add fish sauce and crab meat..you will blow your mind!..please try this before comment's and let me know how you all go. I guarantee perfection! Ciao
Thankfully, I find white rice to be tasteless, so I not only get better flavor AND nutrition, but I never have it clump up.
Too much oil dear
Im gonna try it in today’s Iftar .. thanks!
where can i find the recipe for this?
I will also cook fried rice today.
I'm hungry!
Sooo good!
Do it again since it looks so dark
Your really good thank you i subcribe
Awesome recipe been eating it for a month now!!
I love when she eats in the beginning.  I wish she did mukbangs!
Do you call those round green things green beans where you're from? Here in the U.S. we call them green pea's. Regardless, it looks delicious and I'm making your recipe this weekend for some guests. I've made a number of your other recipes for my guests and they absolutely love it! They are all really, really good!
Soya sauce overkill! Fried rice needs to be white and fluffy certainly not brown. Also secret is using fresh steam rice as overnight rice makes fried rice Soo dry and horrible
Girl, I made it for dinner before 15 minutes. Ohh my holy god that was so tasty food 😁❤️
The lack of sound makes the video eerie ahaha. Nice video, thanjs
Frieddilicous and 😋 ♥️🍇🔥🌈🎉🌱
Im so hungry UGHHHHHH
https://youtu.be/hOOU0AhSBSA
Amazing meal. Thank you for sharing
Add MSG for the real fried rice taste 😋
I just made this and it’s so good😍
Seems like such a little sweetie... ty will try asap
Girl why didn't you just beat the rice with the egg beater lmao??
No MSG?  Hiyaaa!    LOL.   Looks good!, although I add a touch of Sesame Oil to mine for that real take out flavor!
Tried it. Great recipe! Thanks!
Jack Pot! Great recipe  & video. Direct & to the point.. Trying  my hand at it tomorrow,  thank you.
You said everyone loves it even vegan and vegetarian?
Thank you
Nice!
Simply good 👌🏼... Opted for 🍤 instead of 🐔
I am making this tonight thank you so much
I know now why my friend rice never turned out. I dump everything at once. Thanks for the steps!
Tasty!
Super!!!
Which rice was used?
Made this today. Turned excellent.  Great recipe! Thank you.
Even though I just ate, after I saw your dish, I was still about to eat the phone!
Best fried rice I've ever had :]

I just made this for my family for dinner and it is almost gone! They loved it! Thanks will be following for more :)
That was great. Let's do it again. More slowly. Hmm. Good.
Pls tell me the name of rice(I mean Jasmine or something??)..and how to cook them in rice cooker..I have no idea without basmati rice only
too much cringe.
Hola como estas ? soy nico tengo 11 años y con mi mama tenemos una huerta solidaria  sobre arena  somos de Argentina  y vivimos a cinco cuadras del mar pasamos por tu canal ynos encanto tu receta así que  nos suscribimos y para no perdernos nada hicimos clik en la campanita. Te invitamos a visitarnos
Wow that came out good I can taste it from here.
Thank you, I will try this❤️
This is how I make it. Most youtube cooks, cook the egg and leave it on the side. No, it gets tough that way. Cook and remove. That's the ticket
In my experience the most challenging element in fried rice is the rice itself.  Do you have a recipe for how you make your rice?  I'm used to the 'free boiling' method but it looks like you have used the absorption method.  Any tips would be greatly appreciated.
Niece and nephews unite
Thanks for making this! This is now my go to recipe everytime I want to make fried rice 🍚
Mmm looks yummyyy
No msg??? Nah this is not chinese baby this is normal american stuff
I think I'll just married an Asian lady I suck at cooking 😒
Finally! A fried rice that actually taste good. THANK YOU this will be my go to recipe from now on 😊
Greatly appreciated! Definitely the best rice I've ever made!!
I bought everything but the wok.  Omg it came out amazing.  My family loved your recipe.  Thank you so much for sharing with us.  I can’t wait to try your other recipes.  😊😊
looks like theres too much soy sauce.  the rice is very dark
Are you a good person?  The Gospel  Four Things You Need to Know About God (you might be surprised!!)   By Ray Comfort  1. GOD IS HOLY AND JUST  “Righteousness and justice are the foundation of Your throne; mercy and truth go before Your face.” (Psalm 89:14)  In civil law, a good judge must punish crime. If he turns a blind eye to injustice, then he is corrupt and he himself should be punished.  In one ten-year period in the United States, 100,000 murderers were never brought to justice. These were unsolved crimes. If God turns a blind eye to those murderers, then He is corrupt by nature. It makes sense that if He is good and just, He should be angry with those who have taken the lives of others, and He should punish murderers, rapists, etc. This is the teaching of the Bible—that God will “by no means clear the guilty.” He “will bring every work into judgment, including every secret thing, whether good or evil.” “God is angry with the wicked every day.”  2. HIS WORD SAYS “THE WAGES OF SIN IS DEATH”  “Sin is transgression of the Law.” (1 John 3:4)  Let’s look briefly at the Ten Commandments (Exodus 20), and see if we have kept God’s Law:  You shall have no other gods before Me  You shall not make yourself a graven image  You shall not take God’s name in vain  Remember the Sabbath, to keep it holy  Honor your father and mother  You shall not murder  You shall not commit adultery  You shall not steal  You shall not lie  You shall not covet  Before we say we have obeyed the Commandments, this is what someone would be like if he kept the Law—he would always love God with all his heart, with all his soul, with all his strength, and with all his mind, and love his neighbor as much as he has loved himself. He has never made a god to suit himself (either with his hands or in his mind).  He has always given God’s name reverence, kept the Sabbath holy, honored his parents implicitly, and never once has he been “angry with his brother without a cause.” He has never hated anyone, had lust in his heart, or had illicit sex. He has never stolen even a paper clip or ballpoint pen, or told as much as a “white” lie, and not once desired anything that belongs to someone else. He is, and always has been “pure in heart,” perfect in thought, word, and deed.  The truth is, we are not like that. We have all “sinned” many times, and therefore we have stored up God’s wrath, which will be revealed on Judgment Day. The proof that we have sinned will be our death, and after death we must face God in judgment.  Think of it—if He has seen our every thought, word, and deed, and if He is going to bring all of our sins out as evidence of our guilt on the Day of Judgment, we will all be found to be guilty. Our conscience has shown us right from wrong; we will be without excuse. God will give us justice, and Hell will be the place of our eternal punishment. “For there is nothing covered that will not be revealed, nor hidden that will not be known.”  3. GOD IS RICH IN MERCY TO ALL THAT CALL UPON HIM  “But God, who is rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us…” (Ephesians 2:4)  A youth once borrowed a fast car, and in a drunken stupor, sped through his hometown at 120 m.p.h. Since everything was horse-drawn in his country town, there were no laws against speeding. So the council passed a law saying that 30 m.p.h. was the maximum speed, and that any transgressors would be fined $100 for every m.p.h. over the speed limit.  On his way back through the town, the speedster decided to pull the same prank. He was apprehended, tried, and found guilty by his father, who was the town’s only judge. He was fined $9,000, and because he had no money and no words of defense, the youth was led off to prison. As he sat in despair behind bars, his father appeared at the door, and told him that he had sold all his own prized possessions and paid the fine for him. The son couldn’t believe that he loved him that much. They embraced as they never had before, and walked off in a new-found relationship, bonded together with love.  That’s a picture of what God did for us through the gospel  We have all broken God’s Law a multitude of times, but God came to this earth in the person of Jesus Christ, and paid the fine—”For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.” The Bible says, “The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.”  Jesus satisfied eternal justice, and then rose from the dead, defeating death. Hundreds saw Him after His resurrection; it’s no fairy tale. Jesus fulfilled all the prophecies about the promised Savior, written in the Holy Scriptures hundreds of years before His birth. But just as we cannot earn a gift, so we cannot earn eternal life by our good works—”For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast.”  4. GOD OFFERS ETERNAL LIFE THROUGH JESUS CHRIST  “He who hears My word and believes in Him who sent Me has everlasting life, and shall not come into judgment, but has passed from death into life.” (John 5:24)  Life’s greatest mystery, death, was destroyed by the One who said, “I am the way, the truth, and the life…” The Bible says, “He who has the Son has life…”  To find the way to God, to understand the truth of God’s Word, and to receive the gift of eternal life, begin by repentance and faith through a prayer like this: “Dear God, I understand that I have broken Your Law and sinned against You. Please forgive my sins. Thank you that Jesus suffered and died on the cross in my place and rose again. I now place my trust in Him as my Savior and Lord. In Jesus’ name I pray. Amen.”  If you have repented and trusted in Jesus, then your sins are forgiven and you can now partake in the blessings of “the New Covenant.” Here are just ten of God’s exceedingly great and precious promises:  You have passed from death into life (Jn. 5:24).  God will supply all of your needs according to His riches (Phil. 4:19).  Jesus will be with you in trials, promising never to leave nor forsake you (Heb. 13:5).  The Holy Spirit will lead you into all truth, and give you the power to live a holy life (Jn. 16:13).  You are cleansed by the blood of Jesus Christ—God has removed your sins as far as the East is from the West (Ps. 103:12).  As you abide in Christ, you will see the “fruit” of His Spirit begin to manifest in your life (Gal. 5:22-25).  As you read the Bible daily, it will come alive to you and cause you to grow in your faith (1 Pet. 2:1-3).  When you pray, God will hear you and answer your prayers (1 Jn. 5:15).  The cross will be continual evidence of God’s love for you (Rom. 5:8).  God “is able to keep you from stumbling, and to present you faultless before the presence of His glory with exceeding joy” (Jude 1:24).  Search the Scriptures daily, and see what God has in store for those that love Him. Honor Christ’s command to be baptized, and find yourself a Jesus-centered, Bible-teaching church and commit yourself to it.  Jesus Christ is coming soon! May God continue to bless you as you obey Him.
Two changes to take it to next level: Add garlic.  Add knob of butter when cooking vegetables.
Add a knod or two of butter when you cook vegetables. It will take it to next level.
Just made it for my family, they loved it! Not one rice grain left 🤗🤗🤗
I don't have any of the ingredients 😅
why do people say   better than takeout??????? ......
Looking at you so happy brings a smile on my face. Wonderful recepties
Your so SWEET & this rice looks delicious & EASY, gonna give it a try!
I only just read the description to find your correction of the baking SODA and NOT the baking powder. I made it already and it still came out so great! I did some other veggies like broccoli and carrots and cauliflower and it came out so delicious.
https://youtu.be/dnj-hdzAibU
Fuck i only have frozen vegetables
It seems to me that these are green peas and not green beans. Correct me if I'm wrong
Needed some msg 😁😁😁😁
Hi thank you so much for your videos I really enjoy them what would be the best wok to buy for home use
lovely
Yum 😋.. I'm definitely going to be trying this Thank you sooooo much 😊🤩
great video! short and sweet to the point and easy to follow
iceicebaby
i'm gonna try this now :) thanks
Bro I did everything and it’s so good
I love how she says salt it’s so cute
Ii loo soo gooo
Looks delicious.... the rice too!
nice and easy.
That looks really good. I love fried rice.
Thanks is so good 👌🏼🥰
Good one..TU....but that little food wouldn't even wet the appetite of a texan kid let alone an adult.
In the video it says baking powder and then when she goes on and talking about tenderizing the chicken and she said baking soda I’m not sure which one it is a baking powder or baking soda
Looks a bit soggy.
What's the name of pan.
My daughter made this and used coconut aminos since she is allergic to soy, it was delicious, a new favorite.
Added chicken bullion power at the end and it tasted fantastic 😀
Make a well in the middle at the end and add your egg in then, cooks everything together, and saves you multiple steps
This little girl has got a great recipe she did a great job explaining it to me and I really love it I’ve made it and we’re gonna make it again thank you
Video description: This chicken fried rice recipe takes 15 minutes to make.  Video: Let chicken rest for at least 30m  Me: You filty liar!
I was looking for Chinese recipes when I found you channel. I wanted to start cooking in a Wok.  Last night, I cooked this recipe for my grand children, they loved it.  That is why I became a supporter of your channel, It is easy to see what a wonderful chef you are.
Disgusting. Bet that crap comes with chinesevirus. 😝🤢🤮
Making this chicken fried rice again!! Thank you for such a great recipe!!
Awesome
So many brownie points with my wife.
other than a sodium nightmare it looks amazing
This looks so good, I’m gonna make it tonight! Thanks for the vid :)
Dark soy sauce?? = browning sauce????
you mention Baking Powder Fist then you say baking soda...which one is it? I see correction below, it is Baking Soda!!!
I can't wait to make this tonight, I have my rice on now and am prepping my chicken. Unfortunately couldn't do next day rice but 6 hours should be good!
just made this, its so simple and goood
Do you have to boil the rice first?
how many people does this serve?
I haven't seen a fried rice video that explains the cooking sequence and ingredients as well as this. my only suggestion is the wok needs to be cleaned immediately after use. wiped of buildup, (No detergent!) , and then on a hi heat  swirl a ~ dash of hi temp oil  around the inside .    To maintain the Wok's non stick properties .      And a Steel Wok is the only way.    ( Teflon = BS)
No sugar..?
You did a great job thank you
Do you do videos on what rice , esp white rice ?
uncle rogar no like dish all wrong no msg hai yaa
Wow this looks so good im getting hungry just watching BUT I HAVE HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE SO NOOOOO SALT FOR ME 😱 I CANT WAIT TO TRY THIS 😋THANK YOU VERY MUCH 👍🏾👏🙏🏿💖
She says baking powder at first but she means baking soda. Excellent recipe.👍
Looks Delicious 😋
Just made this chicken fried rice omg it really is better than take out by a mile !!! Fantastic will try all the others. A big thanks 🙏 to you
I shopped for "Dark Soy Sauce" but no luck.. Do you mean low salt soy sauce and regular soy sauce???
Really looking good was trying to cook some chicken fried rice and thanks for your video I will do great thanks.
1/2 tsp msg.... perfect
Why do none of the fried rice videos on youtube mention how to avoid sticky rice???? Followed these steps perfectly but ended up with super sticky rice :(  and yes I used 1 day old rice from the fridge.
Why do I torture myself watching these videos lol.
I ate fried chicken rice literally everyday when I lived in China. I still can't remake it after trying so many times. I truelly miss it.
thanks, bugwoman
I started watching Uncle Roger earlier and now I can't stop watching fried rice videos. This one looks great! Uncle Roger would be proud.
Omg I got the same spoon
This was good fried rice.  I think its hard to judge portions of chicken and rice (not mentioned), but I think you can wing it.  Thanks
Thank you for the recipe. I just made it and it turned out delicious. I love fried rice and I can finally make it thanks to you.
for me that's a little too much of dark soy Sauce
This has been by far the best/simple fried rice recipe that I’ve ever prepared. I made quite uh bit and there were absolutely no leftovers! So good! Thank you!
What an aweful voice....
Is it baking powder or baking soda, pick one
Can u teach me how to make the best corona virus?
Guyss itss the besstt❤️❤️❤️😍😍😍 i added sweet soy sause and it taste better

Beautiful dish!
Amazing!
hun hao
I found this video cuz it was on a playlist for Jacksepticeye playing Visage...
Nice simple recipe
The biggest thing I have learned from making fried rice is it has to be refrigerated. It is a must to make fried rice.
I had fried rice for supper and you make me want more!!
can i use baking powder in place of baking sofa
LOVE HER!
I know what I'm having tonight....
Yummy
Yum! :)
Great recipe! A little too much soy sauce for me tho 👍
love it
How did you end up in Ecuador?  Great video too.  :)
I fell in love watching this from you. Looks so yummy. Going to make this. Thanks for the amazing video.. wow!💪👏👏👏👏👏
You know I tried one of the other fried rice recipes one time but it turned out smelly like an apple. Which ain't the way rice should smell.
This is the best fried rice recipe I’ve ever tried. And I have tried many. It tastes truly better than takeout. I had to come on here and just say this because I’m truly impressed. But you do have to follow the preparation exactly like she does
I just made this and let me be the first to tell you...OMG THIS IS THE MOST AMAZING DISH! holy cow...still “snacking” on it. Won’t be any left for anyone else....so good.
Hey lady this was easier than I thought and very good I plan on trying more of your recipes thank you very much
Made that tonight. First time I cook something Chinese that actually taste Chinese, my daughter said. Thumbs up.
Thanks! I just made this and it’s delicious!!! 🤤
Next on my agenda🍜 😋👌👍
Trusst Me!!
I live in a condo and always worry about hot oil cooking and fire
What kind of wok do u use there and where can i find it? Non-stick right?
Are people just losing their collective minds on YouTube?!?  THIS is an excellent fried rice recipe.  Why give it a thumb's down?  SMH
make it look so easy,whenever i make fried rice it looks like a dung hill :(
Very nice recipe! I like almost all your recipes, I‘ve tried several of them - yummy! Today I have a „Kwai lo“-question: Why you take light and dark soy-sauce and not only one of them?
Looks so delicious! 😋  I NEED This in my life!!!!
Which rice did you use ? X
You married?
Very yummy,
You mentioned "add a pinch of baking powder" but then you said "adding baking soda will make it juicy..." Could you please clarify? Edit: saw the details under your video. I had already put my ingredients on my chicken (baking powder). I rinsed... we'll see how it goes.  Edit II: it turned out well. Instead of soy sauce (s), I used fish sauce and oyster sauce. Everyone ate it up.
Very good and simple, Thanks for sharing.
I love this. Gonna try it !✌🏼❤️
Looks great!
Your ingredients first said banking powder and then you change it to baking soda.  Please confirm which is it?
My left ear loved this tutorial
In your recipe it says green beans, but you use green peas here....lovely recipe😊
How do you make egg foo yong I like to learn that
Oh I’m sooo hungry 🤤
i think i found my food soulmate XD
Woo Hoo It looks great and totally do able!  Can't wait to give it a go!  TY and two thumbs up on your videos!
I'm on my 10th or so fried rice video, and so far nobody has actually measured the amount of day-old rice to use in proportion to the amount of sauces to mix into it 🙄
Can you add olive oil to the chicken instead of vegetable oil?
Excellent video. Thank you🙏🌎❤️💋
I love how you say in China we use what we have in the fridge 🥰
I am sure she hasn't try a bbc yet,she will forget about that recipe right away.
Awesome
Time to search for a chinese wife
That looks too good 🤤😍
Very greasy
#freeuyghur
She eating that rice with a giant dessert spoon!! YASS!

This dark soy sauce, is it salty or sweet? I have mushroom soy sauce only as dark soy sauce. And that is salty
excellent video. :D
This is really informative! I've been trying to look for a awesome YouTube vid like yours that teaches everything in this vid! 🙌Your lesson is like the videos of Dr. Ethan! His videos are useful and he really helped me on exams. He is an informative med student.  You should check out his YouTube out and give Doctor Ethan a like! ➡️ #DrEthanOnline
I tried your wonderful recipe and it turned out EXCELLENT! My friends loved it, they thought I got it from the restaurant and was trying to pass it off as mine. Thanks again and please share more of your delish dishes. :)
You are so cute.
I whipped this together for my beautiful bride and she loved it. !  Now I’m going to make it again by demand. I’ll keep it in my favorites.  Thanks so much for sharing.
Made this many times, often without the chicken and it's so good. Lovely girl.
This looks so amazing! Thank you!
the peas get cooked in such a short time?
You are awesome! Thank you so much . I bought your wok set and it is great.
Too much oil

I’m only 18 seconds in and I’ve already subbed, you’re adorable and I love your energy lol
This looks SO GOOD!!
Fried Rice has been a favorite of mine for decades, & this presentation looks absolutely delicious. Really really well executed video. Thank you. I enjoyed it very much.
No. For me. Too much oil. How much oil you add...? When cook the vegetable, when fried the egg, then when fried the rice.

OK I have been cooking this recipe for some time and just love it.  I actually like to think of mine as veggie fried rice with chicken.  I made it today with carrots, celery, red pepper, red onions, spring onions, snow peas, and bok choy. I put the boc choy in just before I remove the vegetables and chicken to begin cooking the rice.  Now my problem.  Everything goes well for me except for frying the rice.  I add the vegetable oil, I stir vigorously, and it always sticks.  I use a cast iron wok, heat is high.  I have seasoned the wok and everything else fries nicely.  What do you think I am doing wrong?  Or is it the wok?

Hello Mandy, this was a great recipe, and as you said it was soooooo good. Thanks for your videos.  I'm  trying more recipes thank you and have a wonderful safe day. Truly quick.  😘😘😘😘
I know I’m late but do you recommend adding oysters sauce for flavor
I think me likes the chef, too!♡
Im going to make this 100 times. Thank you!!!
This was SOOOO good, thank you for such a great video! You are so upbeat and happy and explain things very well
Yum!
That looks Yum
Do you know the calories of this? And the macros? 🤍 So amazing!

Your recipes are Siriusly outstanding keep it up
Where’s the Knorr stockpot?
thank you you sexy lady
In love with the wok.  The Amz link takes it to the one with wooden handle.  Please share link to the one on your video.  Thanks 😊
I just made this and it’s the best fried rice recipe I’ve found! Thank you!!
It looks yummy! I also add chopped bacon and the bacon drippings to it. The taste is so good!
Baking powder, instead of baking soda ?
This video is the best thank you making it again for the third time gave sum to my Hispanic neighbors and they loved it.
Baking powder or baking soda? The first minute you say both.
I think I fried the rice on too high heat for too long. It came out crunchy!
Very Good Video. Actually watching it was enjoyable.
Wait....baking powder or baking soda?? Different things. (Great video!)
Who the hell are the 3.1k people who disliked this video. Lol
What kind of rice are you using?
Can’t be ordering all the time during quarantine so this is a blessing! Thank you

Love this Girl : )
Nice! What’s the difference between dark and light soy sauce?
Very good! Thanks for sharing.
Made this tonight. It truly is better than takeout!
Thank   you so much ...this rice was amazing...I added fresh ginger and some a 1/4 teaspoon of dry mustard
Yummy.
I made this the other night. It was awesome
I've done this recipe and my family loved it. You can't fail on this.
I cant wait to try it! Most recipes on the internet are not that great....
Do this every blue moon it's so easy and quick I love it
Love fried rice. A staple in our family since the 70’s. I just found your site this past weekend. Getting to fat on COVID Italian cooking!  😂😂😂. Need lighter fair. Thank you!!!
Can I make this with left over rotisserie chicken?
We use whatever left in the fridge 👍
You're so lovely, i like your expression
Uncle Roger wants you to add some MSG.
what brand rice do you recommend?
Best tutorial ever god bless you 🙏
What if u dont have dark soy sauce
what type of rice do u use?
If I want to make the rice with pork or beef. Do I season it in the same way as the chicken? I am very excited to try this recipe. Thank you for your videos.
Thank you!
哇！ 太好吃了 ！谢谢 😋
No msg? Hiyaaaa
How much rice ??
this looks so good
I'm definitely making this for Christmas 😉
She has a voice I call live with.
I’m still wonder on how hard it is to drop cornstarch in a bowl without throwing it all over the bench.
I like her english
So, I decided to try this recipe.  Turns out, I've been doing fried rice wrong all this time. Will be using this recipe for now on.
looks so good. I am going to try this.
More onions and less (or not at all) peas as those peas from the US generally are just tasteless and (to me) fillers. Shroom (better if portabella 🍄) and yellow or red diced bell pepper. Actually, fried rice with some minced (small amt) ghost pepper 🌶 would make this dish superkillin’ for those that love the tingling kick behind their tongue; then quench it with a nice dry 🍺 ...
M
looks nice sweety
Ae u a pre-teen?
Ubjerdvjonfrknn As Alt. Lord know soy sc has tons.
That,s alot.ofnoil. Use ava.
That looks yummie
Good job! 👍🏻
You are awesome
Baking Powder or Baking Soda?
I'm so glad I found you! Best videos! I will be trying them all!
Where uncle roger at?
I’ve used your recipe on numerous occasions with family and they too reckon it’s better than take out. Thanks 😊
I love your easy to follow recipes and your enthusiasm! Xiexie 😊
Too much oil....
🤤
Made the exact same thing and I still prefer takeaway
I tried this recipe twice in one week. It was sooooo good. 😩
I made this. Delicious!
Looks good and tastes better.
You make me feel good about life
She’s so small and the 🥄 s so big
I just made this and it tastes great! I just added my own seasonings though
I tried this recipe and it was great but next time, I will add sesame oil to enhance flavor and less oil.
It that kinda stuff https://youtu.be/hN1k6shyPY8
I love u. And your cooking
Breaking up the rice with wet hands is a great tip! I'll do that next time. Fried rice is so easy and that was the only part I never cared for... Breaking it up in my wok.
When I watched this video I thought this doesn't look so good but I'm gonna try it anyway, Lord above it blew me away, thank you to the lady that made the video me and my friends were literally fighting over 2nds. I did not know about the baking powder trick and yes indeed it works, also I never knew about do the egg first but know it makes perfect sense as the rice does not stick together. Brilliant recipe I would recommend this to everyone.
This is my go-to fried rice recipe. Thanks Mandy, glad I found your channel!
Just made this. It’s the best fried rice I have ever made! I did not have dark soy sauce, so I substituted it with soy sauce plus a 1/2 tsp of sugar. Definitely adding to my recipes and for future leftover rice!
MY NAN COOKED FOR CHARLES KAO   xx
Oishi
dark soy makes a big difference
Which brand rice and soya sauce they using for chineese fried rice. Anyone mention pls
Tried this recipe, it was great! We also did this recipe with shrimp, also amazing!
I will try this.. can I use white onion if I don't have the red onion?
Excellent recipe one of the best on the internet Bravo❤❤❤❤
Verrrrry good. I tried it.
I thought she added MSG 😂 I been watching too much uncle Roger
I’m getting a Chinese tonight nw ...🤤
To much oil for me
My mouth was watering this entire time.
Eat this twice a week and you definitely have fatty liver fram all that oil
Ohhh my gosh ! I love when she says that :). She always sounds so cute ! Her personality makes cooking yummy !
Not bad but you didn't even wash your chicken properly or cooked it good  Looks raw
Yum! 💜
You seem like the sweetest person ever :)
I like a bit of toasted sesame oil as well.
The best one woow I'm gonna make it now 😍😜
OMG, I Just made this. It's just delicious.
uncle roger don't approve hija
Bruh this chick is like unhealthy skinny
I made this a week ago after watching a video how to make non-sticky white rice. It turned out amazing. My wife loved it.
Mine was sh@$
Another winner! Thank you!
How do you eat so well and stay so skinny?
Looks delicious
Made this tonight - soooooo good! Thank you for the recipe and video!
But does Uncle Roger approve?
I have made this several times  Just saying reduce the salt
3000 dislikes came after 5:47
Wait a minute I'm un clear about something. was that rice boiled before it was put into the wok?
I watched this video 3 years ago, and I'm watching it again ready to actually prepare it 😅.
Wait so no sesame oil? Is sesame oil part of a different style or just completely wrong?
There is not one Oriental style restaurant within 50 miles that has a decent fried rice here.  The Thai place in Crystal River is a possibility, but, so far, I've only had noodles there.  Before Covid-19, they would not do take out, but, that may have changed.  I don't want to say something is not good if I've not tried it.  The norm is some peas and either minced or finely ground carrot.  You won't find chunks of anything.  Even roast pork is ground.  It's also flavorless.  Covid-19 is not why I make fried rice.  I make it because I love well-prepared and flavorful dishes.  This recipe looks similar to mine and she explains it very well.  Another thing you are hard pressed to find is egg in the mix.  Egg makes it substantial enough to have as a meal, meat or no meat.    Making a large batch, I will use 4 eggs and soft scramble them first. The only thing I would add is a bit of ginger over the carrots, grated or the powdered.  Not a lot, because it is strong.  Just a pinch in the amount of rice she made, and scant 1/2 tsp. in a large batch. I prefer large chunks of sweet onion, too. At the very end, right when you turn off the heat, add a  couple drops of sesame oil.  No more than that.  It's strong, but adds so much flavor.  In a large batch, 4-5 drops.  Taste before adding more.  All in all, this is a great cooking video.  You should mention day old rice in the beginning, because that, is key!
Also add a 1/4 tsp of Sesame Oil, fot an identical take out taste!
When she said “oh and the egg” by that point I was gone she had me at the chicken and veg
Great recipe, thanks. At 4:16 I believe it's 2 teaspoons DARK soy sauce, I listened a few times.
I just made this tonight for my family and it’s really good. I seasoned the chicken a little with onion powder, pepper and a little salt.
I want to marry a Asian woman.I love the food so much .
Girlllll this looks amAzing!! 😍😍

Hi, I also love your cooking ad thank you for telling what difference of seasoning and sauces for your othe dishes ****
This recipe is amazing!! I made it as a veggie fried rice to go with my orange chicken and it is so good!!
Very tasty god bless plz visit my channel
tag uncle roger
Making this for thanksgiving.
Really better than take out
I tried this just today. Mine looks like it needed more soy sauce
What rice do you use?
There is something about eating chicken and eggs that is unappetizing
LACE AND SEQUIN FACE MASKS AVAILABLE NOW!!!!!!!!  XOXOXO https://youtu.be/ARbm_OOGJew
Can I add broccoli 🥦?
I tried that does not taste like the chinese take away. There is a little secret that no one is telling
the best I've seen on youtube
A cutie that can cook wow
What type of rice do you use?
So much vegetable oil... :O
Looking through my cupboards and can’t figure out if I’m missing dark soy sauce or an Asian wife?
hahahaha sheeee is so  adorable
Got super hungry at 1 am so decided to try this recipe, ran out of oil so I used sesame oil and butter instead still turned out so good!!
How many pounds of dog and cat compound should I use
where's the MSG?
Let me tell you story  I looked up 'Jacksepticeye Visage' and up came a playlist. I opened the playlist and looked at its contents. In that playlist was this video. Why? I'm not sure.  Now I know how to fried rice
Baking powder or soda? Lol
woowww..sooper👌👌
I'd replace the chicken with some shrimp💪🏽 this was a good tutorial. Looks delish!
Baking powder or baking soda?
Yummmmm!!! 💕
Hello everyone I’m interested in your opinion about my first cooking video and compare to this Chinese fried rice and thanks for commenting https://youtu.be/M5ghkkLlpvw
Made it tonight. Brilliant, Brilliant, Brilliant. Thank you. Tried to buy your wok but stock is stuck in Germany at the moment. We have had 3 of your recipes in last three days. Marry me please.
I made this and it tasted like nothing 😭
easy fried rice:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7xEEBjp6xg&t=7s
👍👍
I love this recipe. I put cabbage in it too. So yummy 😋
0:33 making a mess on putting the cornstarch   me: ah yeah that's easy
Thank You!
I added a little toasted sesame oil at the very end, made it awesome
Good food
Buying a wok today
Baking soda or baking powder?
Uncle roger will be happy
https://youtu.be/-OnBOxnIm2I
https://youtu.be/UtCyt4qYRKs. Chicken fried rice recipe recipe
Uncle Roger is disappointed, no MSG!
If this is easy, I wonder what is harder.
Looks delicious but 6 Tablespoons Oil is Seriously Unhealthy. Instead of using 2 Tbs of oil to cook 2 eggs use several teaspoons in a small flat cast iron pan. Your recipe is delicious but very unhealthy that goes for most Chinese food.
I`ve tried doing fried rice and it never works as easy as you did it , you're welcome round my place anytime to do this dish for me !
I love your chinese fried rice, delicious and simple method. I do always put in like a teaspoon of oyster sause, always pinch of white peper instead of black peper and always a tablespoon of toasted sesame oil and done. But yours is just fine and looks petfect if ever other ingredients are missing I make it like this.
I don't know if she's tiny or the spoon is just big.
Great video. Thank you. I bought a wok about 9 months ago, but hadn't seasoned it. This recipe made me season it and make this tonight. Awesome!
Are you an Aquarius 😀
Us takeout restaurants can make the fried rice better, but we don't want to because it's really time consuming and would raise the price of the fried rice lol
U single tho????
Having good utensils helps a lot.
Why the echo computer 💻 voice ?
I think Uncle Roger would be proud.
I usually mix the rice and the egg and stir fry it that way. Just tried this method and it's very good too, the chunks of egg definitly look nicer here,  though they were bit bland, guess I didnt wait long enough after mixing it all together. As a whole, it tasted great :)
Thank you im.gonna make it
Hey, You said in the beginning that you add a pinch of baking powder then you said add baking soda...how much baking soda???  ummmm HUH???
I made this today and the taste was delicious, only problem was that my rice was soggy and mushy. Don't know what I did wrong there.
I love you voice 😅😅
Yup, you're going into my favorites folder
I am in the Caribbean and in my location we have many good Chinese restaurants but they are all Cantonese style food. I miss the Sichuan restaurants in New York and have to do-it-yourself. I can buy ingredients online but your channel is most helpful in how-to.  A big thank you!
very helpful !! 💚
I totally missed about the rice... how did it cook? What kind is it?
Very good tutorial, enjoyable to watch too. And now I'm ravenous
I only change the chicken for shrimps !! was delish..
Another great recipe. I make this once a week for my daughter as she is trying to eat heathy and this fits in with her plan. Thank you again!
Wait, you add 3 tbs of soy sauce and then you add some salt?? Is that healthy?
你那夸张的表情怎么跟演戏一样 晕
Can I eat it without eggs
First recipe that it doesn't look dry
Mmmmmm
That is a lot of oil
This looks so good! 😋 I would make this without the egg and onion, though.
Making rice tonight to have this for lunch tomorrow 👌
is the rice already cooked?
uncle roger liked that
Where is Uncle Roger to clap to what she just did? it is just missing msg, but looks amazing.
Love the recipe ❤️❤️❤️turned out delicious
Hello, could you please show me how to make a Chinese bamy goreng. Our chinese takeaway makes a lovely one....but it is very expensive
https://youtu.be/w23ZpxxwD0c
Where did this gal get those dimples?
Tried this recipe tonight. Turned out amazing. Best fried rice I've made so far! Thank you
Love when she says, 'Take it out'  'Put it in'  ;)
I just used this recipe to make fried rice for my friend and it’s the first time I’ve succeeded!!!! Thank you for sharing your recipe with the world :) <3
I make this when it's "clean out the fridge night" and I always use your sauce recipe using the ingredients you recommended. Thanks for sharing!
15 min? I been here for more than an hour
Super recipe.   But I don’t eat eggs so I leave that step OUT .
Tried a couple recipes and for the first time it actually is like take out dishes from a good Chinese restaurant but better. You wouldn’t think that considering it’s pretty simple to make it wouldn’t be hard to replicate but something is always missing, a flavor or texture or wrong proportions but I had no problem here. Thank You,  I love Chinese food but live in rural Wisconsin ethnic food here you have two choices taco meat on a hamburger bun or ketchup on a saltine with melted American cheese thats called a pizza. Maybe a slight exaggeration.
Looks so much better than the $20 take out I had last night.
This is how my mom made fried rice but she would add a bit of brown sugar which gave it an amazing taste.
This looks good im gonna make the vegetarian style
Thank you ! this looks amazing  and fresh and so easy to do....I can't wait to try it!
Just a tip. Always cut raw chicken on a plastic board, it's safer that way for cross contamination 💖💖🐔
0:40 is it baking powder or baking soda?
Thank you for being the most helpful video I came across since RunnyRunny999 took his old one down.
https://youtu.be/qDvoVsnoAMw  Mr. President Trump's Favourite Dinner,, Support us by Subscribing my Channel Like & Share..
Will Uncle Roger approve?
I love this so much
So simple! I’m inlove 🤍
The other videos I watched were by white guys so I'm like that's trash. Click on this video because...you know.....and she does it the same way yet I said this looks way better. Lol
What type of rice is that?
it’s really good. Chicken is juicy. I used some oyster and hoisin sauce in the rice and it gave it a lot of flavor.
Thanks for the video. I made this tonight and my husband absolutely loved it. ❤️❤️
Turned out amazing! ty sm ☺️
😅😅😅
Thank you for this recipe, love it 😀
Wow great job
It’s just not the same if this adorable young woman doesn’t start with “Hi  everyone “.
Love love love your recipe! Second time making it now 💚 thank you for sharing. You’re doing amazing!☺️
Thanks for this recipe. My son said " it tastes like P.F. Chang! 👌
A natureza é maravilhosa
wheres the MSG
What dark soy sauce did she use :/ I went to the store and bought specifically dark soy sauce and it looked the same as regular soy sauce when I used it. I did not get that color of rice at all :/
Tried it just now. It was amazing! All the ingredients i have in my home, but put together like this to create this awesome taste is just a miracle!
That looks fantastic what rice did you use I can never get my rice right thank you for your brilliant video xx
😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😛😛😛😛
thanks for making these. this really helped
First, you  say a pinch of baking powder, then when explaining what it does you say baking soda.  Which is it?
I have used this recipe several times as a general guideline for egg fried rice.  And just used 4 eggs.  Also, we can't have wheat so I use Tamari in place of soy sauce.  The other day I looked up what the difference is between light and dark soy sauce and the primary difference is dark soy sauce is fermented longer and has molasses.  So I made this again today and drizzled some molasses in.  OMG, took it to the next level of amazing and tasted even more like restaurant fried rice (which I haven't had in a couple of decades due to food intolerances).  For anybody who might need to omit soy altogether and might be using coconut aminos, I bet a drizzle of molasses would work to kick up the flavor as well.  Or if you can't find dark soy sauce.  Just use a tiny little bit of molasses though because its' very strong.  I used probably the equivalent of about a teaspoon.
Looks great!!!!
Your so cute! Definitely gonna try this 😊
I just made this recipe tonight, it was delicious!  It was the first time I used my freshly seasoned wok, recommended on this channel.  It was amazingly simple and very satisfying to make. Since i now have a wok, I’m going to try to cook every recipe on her channel. And as she says, It is better than takeout.
Thank you 😊
You are cute
Is the egg necessary?
Too much work for me, I will just marry her
Another delicious recipe! Love the fresh veggies!
Why would 2.9k people not like this?  🤔
I’m making this, but I’m wondering how the Carrots are in perfect little squares?  Has to be frozen vegetables.  Looks sooo delicious.  I’ve got canned peas & fresh carrots.  Will that work?
I don’t like vegetables oil. I’m allergic to peanuts oil. Can I use olive oil?
Where's the monosodium glutamate??
THAT LOOKS SOOOOOOOOO YUMMMY 💕im glad i watched her video....im gonna try it tonight ...my family deserves extra love from me 💗💕💖
Baking soda or baking powder? Clabber girl or Arm n Hammer? Oh my bad...you listed ingredients   above. Baking soda! Thank you SO much. 👍
Dwl mdr 🤣. She says “wait until the oil starts smoking” lol. Its not a good practice, but i love your video 👍🏽
I used baking powder as per your initial instruction. Then you said baking soda. I haven't finished cooking yet. Waiting to cook for dinner. Does it matter??
Bru just soy sauce?
Why does she talk like that
Where was the msg
She’s like an actress pretending to be a Chinese geek
"how to cook in a cold wok"...
Nice search Malik Khalil;
Finally someone who explains how to make fried rice without confusing me
No what I'll be cooking tomorrow.
Your wok looks handmade by aa craftsman?
I tried this (switched up the veg a bit because of what I like, and added ginger because I personally like it) and it turned out great! It’s delicious, the chicken tip was AMAZING!!! The chicken was super juicy and didn’t get dry at all! Super flavourful and mouthwatering 🤤🤤🤤🤤
I have a question, please.  I used your wok and thought I had it seasoned properly.  As I started progressing through the steps, things started sticking to the wok.  Did I have it too hot?
I made this today.  It is definitely better take out!  Chicken was perfect not dry.  It was all good.
Looking good a must try
I love the shovel she uses to eat the fried rice. 😂
I did and it was delicious.  Very easy.
I usually throw in about a cup of raw un salted cashews into this as well. I love cashews in fried rice.
too salty..
And kicks it off by eating it with a spoon.... Where are the chopsticks?
I don't know if a chinese person eating the dish make it more chinese fried rice...!
She says spatula likes Mr. Krabs
Thanks do one with beef and prawns please
As many times as I've watched this, I always get a kick of "oh, and add the egg."
At about the 40 second mark, she says to use a pinch of baking powder. Then a few seconds later she says that the baking soda helps to tenderize the chicken.  Which one is it?  Baking Powder OR is it Baking Soda???
Looking good a must try
Very nice 🙋🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♀️thanks girl💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕🙏🏻
Thank you for the recipe.. I will try over this weekend...
Where is MSG ?
Chinese people don't do that's..  peace of shit video
That’s a very large dish that you’re going to eat there sweetheart.
Love girls with bangs
Chicken fried oil
Where is MSG? Uncle Roger disapproves.
Just made this for my family for dinner and they LOVE IT!!! Even my 5 and 7 year old boys are eating it and raving about how good it is! They are very picky eaters too lol
WHERES UNCLE ROGER
Great job! Made this tonight & it was so easy.
Sooo good!!! Thank you 😊
me love you long time jo.................................
I just made this tonight and my husband LOVES it!  Thank you
Thank you so much, just made the best fried rice I’ve had in a long time ☺️😋
Would I be able to use this same recipe with beef? Or would it not work?
The color is too dark brown and mushy, wet ... doesn’t look appetizing to me.
I'm so sick and tired of everything until Chicken Fried Rice sounds really good right now!!👍🏾👍🏾😂
You are so adorable lol, ty for this recipe. I will have to try it
This made me so hungry
Never tried fried rice before,made it today,following this recipe, and turned out to be sooo delicious,everybody  loved it,thank you so much  for the best fried rice😊😊😊
Where is uncle Roger.  Her niece cooked perfect fried rice.
I love quick and easy recipes. Will definitely try it. Thank you.
That cornstarch flew😂
How would you need to change the recipe to make pork fried rice instead?
That's not food, it's death. There's too much oil and salt. It doesn't look good at all.
Its green peas not green beans.. or did i hear wrong? 😱 but ya its tasty either way!!
This video should be titled something along the lines of "Easy Stir Fry cooking for dumb millennials".
Uncle Roger and Auntie Hersha need to see this!
That looks delicious 🤝👍
@Nigel Ng, uncle Roger needs to react to this
I made it and it was really good!
Yummmmmmmmmmm
I was recommended this after enjoying Uncle Rogers videos.. haijaaaa
She sounds exactly like mei
Yum
Looks deliciously simple!  I think I'll give it a try.  Thanks!
Uncle Roger would approve of your fried rice.
It'd better be good with 120ml of oil in the recipe.
Eating it with a spoon. A woman of practicality.
You said baking powder and then baking soda. I think you meant to say baking soda?
this is the first and only recipe i watched and need, the comments did not lie and the view numbers are justified 😄
When she said toss She meant... Swirl  When she said transparent She meant..... Translucent  When she said flawffy She meant.... Fluffy 🤓
I tried it . I put more chicken than it called, but the more the merrier...right!!! It was real simple to make. Do you have a shrimp fried rice recipe?!! Delicious!!!
People who own Chinese restaurants dislike this..😏
If you keep using that much oil, America will invade your kitchen. 😉 just kidding. Looks great.
Which rice is best for this ? Jasmine or any white rice ?  Thank You !
sorry but it would be better without so much dark soy sauce
This young lady KNOWS HOW TO COOK!  I’ve made several of her recipes and OMgosh, so delicious!!!  Best chef on YouTube, hands down.  Will make this fried rice this weekend and will post the results.
Love your channel https://youtu.be/RXm_Xs2rqxI
Do I really need a wok or can I use a regular frying pan?
I made this tonight & it turned out wonderfully! My family loved it. Thank you so much. 😋👍🏼
Wow, this “try hard” actually took the time to list all the ingredients in the description?!  How dare you help me succeed!   Just for that, I hope all your lifelong dreams come true.  Now go have a great rest of your day!
I love this! I just made this today and my family loves it!
No MSG? Uncle Roger is going to be very upset!
I stumbled across this recipe a little over a year ago and I keep coming back to it.  You’re right—“Everybody loves it!”  I should have it memorized by now, but I think I just enjoy having you talk me through it. Thank you for this recipe!
Do you have a recipe or video for orange chicken? I would love to try and make that with your recipe
I love your video and I wanted to know would it taste the same if I used Freshly made rice or should I leave it overnight?
she defientely walk the wok ,🎎
Somehow I’m here because of Jacksepticeye
At last, someone cooking the egg first and taking it out to blend it later. This is the authentic way.
I never get bored with Chicken and Rice. 5 minute rice is the best invention, 1 part hot water, 1 part rice, let it set in covered bowl (10 min.) Chopped chicken I saved from a roasted one, green Onions, Terriyaki sauce Presto! Easiest meal ever
so....If I make for 4 people how will the recipe change? Please
good eating love to support each other
Thank you for your recipes it looks delicious !
My first try at this came out pretty good, even if I do say so myself.  Will definitely have to try it again!
Those are peas not green beans.  Great recipe though
You look like young Edna Mode :)
U missing msg
i'm cooking my fiancé this for our one yr seventh month anniversary
It's a great way to cook my friend - and it looks delicious too - Your channel is beautiful and special and you too - My complete support for you and it is always happy to communicate with you - Greetings to you
You look like a rainny
Etta yummy 😋
FYI her wok she sells on Amazon is really great. I've had it for about a year and love it
what kind of wok is that?
This one looks exactly like at the restaurants. Which is what I'm looking for
Looks good but also a bit too greasy
This is best Chinese Chicken Fried Recipe I've ever seen. I tried this over the weekend I was off and it was delicious.  I added everything except for the peas and carrots. My boyfriend raved about it and it a thumbs up. We had chicken egg rolls too. I'll try this with pork, shrimp, ham and beef too. Thanks again.
looks really good. That's a looot of oil tho
Mine Didn’t Even look or taste like this!!!! Looked like of bunch of crap in a bowl and I did as said.... it took about an hour...
Good tip on adding baking powder to the chicken to make it cripsy and juicy! This looks great 👍
What would Uncle Roger say
How do you make the perfect Thai jasmine scented rice
This looks so good!!!!
That rice is too dark, makes it unpleasant to eat going by the looks of it.
Nice Wok !
periphery
Wow that looks so amazing. The color makes it look so much better than other fried rice recipes! Love it!
Is it just me or did she never use the spring onions in the recipe???🤔
Hmmm,,that was yummy.. Thanks for sharing
A-Mei-zing!!
Uncle Roger will be so happy to watch this video 😂
So I made this and everyone in my family loved it!
I made it today and used broccoli, frozen mixed vegetables, zucchini slivers, diced onion and garlic, green onions, various seasonings, soy sauce and sesame oil. Turned out great!
What is with all this oil?
Where is MSG?
Namit😋
Thank you so much for the easy version of fried rice. I’m allergic to seafood and everyone else is using oyster sauce the videos
what no spices and it tastes Chinese just like that?
This is the same way we make it in India
Stopped please...
Would it be ok to use olive oil instead?
Will egg go well with it also
Wonderfully presented without BS. Thanks.
Looks delicious.  Can't wait to make it. Thanks!!!
Uncle roger brought me here. Better than aunt hersha and uncle jamie fried rice.. and using wok 😂
I love how she said 30 mins .. she said “sirthy minute”
My rice be sticky and oily 😢😢😢
Love it! Yummy! Hi guys I just started my cooking channel and would like to invited everyone to check it out my channel. Brazilian and Asian recipes quick & easy to make. Very appreciate for your support 🥰🙏🏼
This looks so easy  will try this weekend. Thank  you very much.
Maybe I can't see for looking, but what kind of rice is used??
Thanks for sharing, time to stir fry
It’s like watching asian soft porn
This is how it's done!! Cooking each component of the fried rice separately is best so everything gets fried nicely and evenly - Most of the YT videos get this wrong and cook everything together in the pan at once. Done that way, the result is a mess.  I usually only have one type of soy sauce in the kitchen, so I use normal light soy sauce and add oyster sauce and Shaoxing wine to deglaze. But besides that I make my fried rice exactly the same. Thanks for the video.
🥰 just love her videos 🤭
No msg ?
Am I the only one who noticed how big that spoon she was eating with was? I gotta get me one of those lol.
Nihao.. it looks great!! Thank you soo much for sharing your Chinese recipe I will do this!!
Looks 😋😋😋😋😋😋😋 thanks for sharing the recipe
I made this for my family the other night and it was so delicious it was unbelievable! Better than any take away that I have ever had! My family and I were so impressed! Definitely going to be making this again soon! Best chicken fried rice I’ve ever had and I made it myself! Thank you for sharing this recipe!
I agree this is better way , looks delicious. Hey guys you are ALL WELCOME to Visit me.
I loved the video
I love that WOK. It looks handmade.
Thank you. Could you link the rice 'brand?
Looks so good and so easy , thanks
Perfect ! ty

Where u can buy second tac or wac sauce what that sauce’s name
im so tired of this crap, one min, we are geting a check the next min were not, unless you no fr sure dont say anything, people are in need , they believe what you people say,,
👍
Best chicken fried rice recipe on Youtube. So aromatic, the flavors are amazing. I didn't use "overnight" rice, I just made it early, spread it on a baking pan and let it evaporate for like 30min. I used veggies from a can but regretted it as they got mushy. Making it again with frozen veggies, aside from that, this was GLORIOUS.
Ummmmmmmmmm..... guess im doing it wrong............
*thanx*
God....I love you!
Which type to rice u use ?!
NOT THE BAYANG!!!! THE BAYANGGG!!!! UH OOOH EW WOAH EW WOAH!!!!!!
Hold the bat
👍🏼
Thanks for sharing this great video. . https://amzn.to/3l0y4uu
This b really made a fried oil
thank you I'll definitely try this recipe this week
can you please tell me what ingredients you added to the rice? you mentioned light soy sauce and what else?
I like your video very much. I'm following now. I also wait for you to support my channel. 🌸
Enjoyed making this
great video, short and sweet easy to follow instructions you got my thumbs up and sub for that kia ora
Come on guys, like the video! Many greetings Mati :-)
Your so cute....thanks for your advice🥰
Is it really the traditional way of cooking chinese chicken fried rice recipe ???
Umm hello guys, I don't know if I should even be writing this, but I wanted to share my version of fried rice. Similar to hers, just a little tweaks  I marinate the chicken with salt, pepper, red chilli powder, minced garlic and lil bit of soya sauce.  I then get it stir fried till the chicken becomes golden color  In the veggies, I add a pinch of salt and pepper ( so that the veggies don't taste bland)   In the end after mixing up the rice veggies chicken, I put in a bit of coriander powder too.   Hope it helps someone, trust me it becomes delicious
no spices... too bad.
Okay! So I haven't even watched the video yet but the rice looked so yummy, but it looked so good in the pic.! Good job reeling me in! haha!
Love the recipe and your energy!
This is delicious
Will you marry me please!!
Yummy
Been making my own Chinese food for years, tonight sweet and sour chicken with shrimp fried rice, I normally have white rice,   but I want fried rice
Wow this going to be delicious thanks for sharing. Try this...https://youtu.be/rJJ62EwDGto
Just tried this recipe and substituted with brown rice and added a splash of sesame oil. Came out delicious! Thanks for the recipe! 👍🏼
Aw yeah visage from jacksepticeye
“In China we add whatever we see”
You didn't say the measurements on how much rice to use
That rubbery ass egg is burnt AF.
1:07 WOK: ":D"
It looks amazing
Love this recipe, I make it with fish, beef, chicken. Pretty much any meat that we have in the fridge.  Kids love it too.
How do you find fresh green peas? Buy snap peas and separate? A lot of work. I’ll just use frozen green peas, lmao
Thank for the recipe. I made and enjoyed it today.
Thankyou eating it now
I made this recipe today. It came out perfect, so delicious. I didn’t have dark soy sauce so I used Hoisin Sauce as a substitute. Thanks for the recipe 👌🏼🤤
No on frozen veggie is the key! Or you'll end up with mushy veggies and soggy fried rice. Trust.
Pretty sure those are peas not green beans
GREAT recipe, tasty, easy and QUICK - BRAVO lady! Perfect, easy to understand video PLUS the written recipe in your description, thank you so much for taking the time to do that Myself and I'm sure many other people really appreciate it.  Too many cooking channels do not provide a written recipe to accompany the video - or they cheekily make you click on a link which takes you to their website. That's a cheap trick!
I'm getting fat just watching your videos 🤤 I want to eat everything! Lol (Please bring me some of your cooking 😭)
What temperature should the wok be?
Thank you looks deliscioud im make some
That's a LOT of oil...
How do you make white sticky rice? Or is like any traditional white rice way?
Try it just now 😍👌🏻
Why people are not using fish sauce
She knows what she's talking about...
She confused me with the baking powder and soda
Is the rice precooked, or should it be moist before adding it . I couldn't find another comment like mine
Yum 🙏
What kind of chicken do u use?? Im very new to cooking
So is it baking soda or baking powder in the chicken? You said both
I need a Wok
Where's the MSG??
Good food = Good Life and this is good food!
I have a serious question for you.. hope you will answer... you used a lot of oil in the recipe... but how come you people don't get fat at all around your belly even though you eat fried rice shrimp beef everything more often ... please share what you eat or drink along with this loaded fried rice.. like the soy sauce makes up the fats too fast because of heavy sodium in it.. so what else you do or drink to balance it...
Is this a cooking video or an asmr video? Either way, I'm here for it.
Recipe right from the source, China! 😃 what’s everybody else doing making fried rice. I’ve seen in Mexican, American, Italian and other food channels fried rice. Nothing wrong with that but hands down, Asian know how to make fried rice
Wow!
It looks dam good. I'm going to the store for soy sauce right now. You twisted my arm lol
My rice is always mushy...any suggestions???
What kind of rice are you using?
Hi! Loooove your channel! Can you make a vegetable fried rice recipe?
and i´m suddenly here. think i´ve been watching too many rice videos after seeing that Uncle Roger vid...
Thumbs up. A wonderful version of my favorite dish. Very well presented also. Easy to follow. BTW amazing teeth also!
I made it and it taste amazing
Delicious 😋 I make it like that but I fry the egg in the rice stir fast to coat all the rice then add the rest 😋😋😋also mushrooms in it. Because I love Mushrooms 😁
This made for a tremendously delicious meal, thank you Souped Up Recipes.
The fried rice in restaurants always taste very sweet, but regular soy sauce makes it very salty, what am I missing?
im watching a video about chicken fried rice while eating chicken fried rice
Having to watch you eat after you make something then having to hear you say oh my goooood is getting really old.
Chicken fried rice really good that just was really amazing how your teaching Chinese cooking
Just cooked it...delicious...as usual...love it.
Just finished doing it. OH MY GOD! It was so delicious, just like what I have at asian restaurant in town (only by doing it myself I got larger portion for 1/3 the price - students dream). Thank you 100x.
Just tried it today. turned out very delicious!!
Really Yummy and easy to make deffo recommend
I add 5 spice to the chicken and frying the veg. Makes it even better
My stomach is starving as well.
Ma bro is gonna make something similar (It's his first time in the kitchen and he's 20! I think he deserves a congrats. 🎉👏)
I love chaofan especially when you’re drunk after the club :)
I like your recipe ❤️
Replay this 5x 6:05 😱🤣🤣🤣
ok i don't understand, why wet your hands first? doesn't that defeat the point of letting it sit in the fridge overnight?
This recipe is delicious!
what if i dont like chicken
Good personality
I will call you Ms. Tenderize.
Hi! I tried your recipe tonight. Only thing I did differently was soy sauce. I only had dark soy sauce. Came out really good! Thank you! I will make it again!
This looks fantastic, thanks for sharing this yummy looking recipe, wowee now that's a large bowl for such a petite young lady, lol, lol, lol, thanks a bunch & i enjoyed your happy personality ;-)>, i look forward in making this recipe, thanks again, STAY SAFE ;-)
Wow yummy
No need to be negative some people need to learn how to cook instead of hitting up taco bell every nite spend time with family stay home

My left ear is listening to this recipe
You taught me to cook sesame strips and boy oh boy my fam cant get enough of them🤩🤩 now your teaching me to make chick fryed rice... 4 words... thank u so much👌🌟🥳😃
Your chicken fried rice look so good.
Looks good
Girl I love your charisma but no spice? I was just wondering cause I would have added some green chillies or at least schezwan in some way, but I should try this out first I guess...
Why is this in jacksepticeyes visage playlist?
I'm eating this while watching at the same time
Your enthusiasm is so great. It makes me look forward even more to making this!
One of the best recipe for Chinese Fried rice I ever tried, delicious
Well done looks amazing!!!
00:35  Place chopped chicken in  1 tsp corn starch  1 tsp soy sauce 1 tsp Veg Oil Pinch of baking soda  NOT powder 😁
Amazing!!! You are great ;-)
This recipe was amazing!
so no need for oyster or fish sause for this? only for the prawn and the no meat version?
I have no soy sauce, so I’m not gonna put it in. 😔
I made the recipe and it was  "THE BESTI EVER HAD!!!!' Thank you so much I appreciated it.
Can l use pork instead of chicken. How do I fry it?
Watching From The Philippines!! 🇵🇭
Cool knife, it looks stealthy 💯😎

Delicious! Great way to use leftovers and easy enough for those culinarily challenged
Your enthusiasm and excitement is infectious. Inspires this tyro chef to do what else?? Start cooking.
Its look like salty look at the rice
Don't put your video in a jacksepticeye playlist
Oh Yeah, I love this YouTube Teacher...! She Reminds Me of My Ex-Girlfriend... Pretty, Nice, and Sweet... Really Sweet, I mean REALLY DAMN FORGIVING CARING CAVITY-CAUSING SWEET! We are Still Friends, She is to Sweet to NOT Just Be Friends..?  ATTENTION Ladies: Guys Like the Slutty Whore in Bed, Sometimes.....  ....Oh, Crap, She Might Read This... Ah, she'll forgive Me? ;)
ARE YOU SERIOUS! That is All I Need? Except for the Dark Soy Sauce, I have This... And, as a Bachelor, Just Using What is Left in the Fridge (ice cooler), This is My Deal!! Although, I also Have Batteries in there???
no matter what you add it still doesent taste the same as the chinese takeaway!
what kind of rice do you use
Awesome...
Use chicken thighs instead.
I love your video!! Thank you for making this video. This fried rice is so delicious!! I made this recipe twice and it was delicious!!
Thank you so much!!! It was sooooo good
My fried rice always comes out in a big mushy lump.  Any suggestions????
Love your channel ♥️😍👍🏼
Nice content my friend tnx for sharing done to support you pls visit to my home
I heard some ppl use sugar, is it true
Thank you!!! Wow you are a very good teacher, I been following your videos for at least 5 years. And the foods were always delicious.
Sorry but must have chinese curry sauce
You seem to be a good cook. I have a lot to learn.😄💛👍👍
First baking powder then baking soda. Which is it?
I made It and loved It! Thank you
Gonna try this one in the morning. Thanks for no ads, no background music and for the easy ingredients ❤️
I love ur knife!!!!
🤤
Lol😂 asians
Hindu rice is better😉
ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT... I KILLED IT... BUT I HAVE TO ADMIT...I CHEATED... I BROUGHT RICE FROM THE CHINESSE RESTAURANT... WANTED TO MAKE CERTAIN IT TURNED OUT RIGHT. AND IT DID!!!!!!
I just tried it and it was soooooo good. Hands down, the simplest fried rice recipe I've seen so far. My first time making fried rice. I added shrimp to mine. THANKS FOR THIS VIDEO 😊
In the 10 yrs I've been married to my husband, he has never liked fried rice. Well,  I've made fried rice twice using your recipe and he loves it.  😊
Would like to learn
Can you make chicken low main
Thank you for having a link to a printable recipe! Question - if I don’t have dark soy sauce, what can I use instead to give the rice that dark color?
Yummy
Yum Yum and so simple...thanks for sharing!
This recipe looks delicious. My grandson has an egg allergy, so I won't use the egg in his.  I think that I can alternate by using shrimp instead of chicken sometimes. Thank you for teaching me how to cook fried rice properly.  Blessings to you and yours!🙏💯😋❤
Please tell me where you got your knives from!!!
Is "day old rice" rice that was boiled the day before and left overnight ?
I did this recipe, except for the chicken, i cooked it all the way and added brown sugar and soy sauce to make Teriyaki. I cooked the vegetables separately, then added everything together and infused at end. Was a amazing “at home” experience, it was super easy, it was better than takeout and mi Marido agreed!   Thank you so much! Gonna cook it again now, thank you.
I've made this so many times, it's tasty but lacks a little in flavour so I just add some rice wine, extra soy and golden mountain sauce and yum!
“it takes only 15 min” not when u still have to make rice bc this is the first time in my 14 years of life that we don’t have left overs😫
Just made this, so good!
I don't like it because I love it
Just made this tonight.  OUTSTANDING !!  Thank you....look forward to trying more recipes from you .  😊
Can you also use two tablespoons of light soy sauce??
IVE BEEN MAKING THIS FOR SO LONG AND I ONLY JUST FOUND OUT THAT YOU HAVE TO USE BAKING SODA AND NOT BAKING POWDER
I tried making fried rice multiple times, all of which were mediocre at best. But this video helped me make the best rice I ever made for my family.
the best..thanks
You are a saviour for the Chinese food thirsty peeps like me
Amazing. Just made this in lockdown as our local Chinese is shut still. Really good recipe. Thank you ☺️
A second option for those who do not want the baking soda directly in their mix is to add it to their diced chicken or beef, let it sit for 10 minutes, and then wash it off well. This will create the same tenderizing effect on chicken or beef while getting rid of any excess baking soda. (Fun fact: If you listen closely, you can hear it sizzling during the process (: ) Enjoy!
Why was this shit in jacksepticeye horror playlist?
Im getting hungry already this looks delicious girl
Anyone watching during lockdown ✌️
Thank you for the instructional, it was quick, concise and easy to follow. Well done!👍
SHIT ..your hands ,arms keep changing color...WTF   ?brown,white backwards  and forwards ... ps  you are too skinny to make great food ...Farcough  !
OMG yummy !!!
I made this at home and everybody loves it. :)
Enjoyed your video, and loving the rice cooked this way!  I’ve already made it a few times, but thought I’d comment to thank you. So thank you!  🙏🤙
Brilliant very clear and easy no messing thanks
I will try one day :)
Where did you get you spatula?
In this video did you say u used Baking Powder or Baking soda??????!!
So what kind of rice works best here?
Easy, simple & great recipe! Thumbs up!
Damn it, I put baking powder instead of baking soda on the breast chicken 😢
Thank you so much for your recipe! It looks so good! I really like fried rice, but I didn't know how to cook it correctly. Thanks!
Looks so good but I  just would not add any extra salt
my sister is so picky with food and ate 3 bowls!! made enough to feed our neighbors and friends too, for only about $30 for the ingredients!! thank you! this is the best!!!
Awesome video! 👍 You keep it straight and simple!  I like how you made the rice color brown just like "old school fried rice". Maybe you should add bean sprouts and ginger?
Guess I’ll make this tomorrow. “Day old rice” is the trick to good fried rice
Guess I’ll make this tomorrow. “Day old rice” is the trick to good fried rice
Missing a few drops of sesame oil. But looks great otherwise.
Ok! so I just made this and OMG! IT WAS THE BOOOMB! THE MAN I DATE HATES EVERYTHING NO MATTER FROM YOU A RESTAURANT OR ME GOT DAMNIT, AND HE ATE IT AND THE DAMN PORCELAIN BOWL. 😭😂😂👍💪👏 THANK YOU SOO MUCH FOR YOUR IMPECCABLE SKILLS LADY, I'M DEFINITELY MAKING THIS AGAIN, BUT WITH A TWIST 😘
Btw I didn't see you add baking soda. 😒 Nice video I enjoyed it, thanks.
Bout to attempt this soon as my guy walks thru that door lol. I would have thought u wouldn't have cooked the eggs for soo long since they were going to be cooking again with the mixture, fyi saw that in another video. Looks great btw 😋 my turn.
I got the wok you sell, I seasoned it following your instructions.... and tonight... I made my first chicken fried rice in it using this recipe..... it was awesome! I was surprised at how easy it is and how quickly it is made once you get going. Thank You very much, will be making more of your recipes!
https://youtu.be/q5U-8Eev2Qc try this too
You put baking soda but you said baking powder on the video, and the second time you finally said it right that it’s baking soda.
Looks bomb for better flavor tho And even flavor thru the dish instead of taking stuff out and cooking one at a time add in layers rice being last😋😋😋
this is so scrumptious
Excellent technique.  My grand daughter does not know it is not take out.
Absolutely YUM! I changed it up used chicken flavored Rice A Roni, threw in some snow peas. Topped it off with cashew nuts!
Thankyou !  It looks easy to make and yummy :-)  Will try to make it tonight :-)
Super easy to make and by far one of the best dishes i tasted thank you !
You are one of my favorite cooking youtubers! Thanks for everything!
Have you already boiled the rice,   Also did you say “day old rice?”, great vid thanks for sharing. 🐵
Good Stuff!!!!
I'm confused about which type of oil to use.  Other videos call for peanut oil, while other ones call for sesame oil, yet vegetable oil is used in this one.  Is one particular type of oil preferred over the others (as far as taste is concerned) or it really doesn't matter?
Hi how come theres no oyster sauce in this but it's in the shrimp fried rice one?
How much rice do you put in?
She means green PEAS in the list of recipe ingredients, not green BEANS.
I'm getting hungry!!!!!!!!!!!
I’m on a 21 day water fast, it’s 5 in the morning and I’m watching this :)
its 2 AM in morning and now I am hungry XD
2:30 - those are peas tho. :P
shes making me so hungry
Wow wonder recipe!!
Thanks to you I was able to seem like I can cook :) My family enjoyed it.
Sorry are u saying dark Soy sauce or Duck soy Sauce ?????????
Ok this is the first time I ever attempted making fried rice....I followed this recipe and it turned out awesome!  My husband is pretty tough critic and he raved through the whole meal!  He has instructed me to subscribe and start making your recipes!
I just bought the light and dark soy sauce from amazon I will try with what I have now but I can't wait till the right stuff comes in yummy
I just made it which was so good! Thank you for sharing such an awesome recipe. :)
Thanks for your wonderful video. I hope you will like this video as well: https://youtu.be/re5eimJdyvM
Just found that recipe. Looks delicous and I think I will try to make this next week. Question about the rice: Do you cook the rice before you add it to the wok or do you just clean it with water? In the video, I assume the rice was already cooked.
What kind of rice do you use?
I wonder how long you can keep white rice in the fridge
Thank you!
I could eat all that, must make double amount so wife could get a tablespoon or two. Fat boy eats hearty.
What a cheerful and informative chef. Thank you! Brightened my Day and filled my belly. Doesnt get much better.
Looks delicious I’m going to try it
Great video, but you said add baking soda and then, repeating, you said baking powder. I have trouble keeping these straight already. Which one is it?
I absolutely love fried rice and this seems like a great recipe. Thanks for sharing!
That stuttering oh yeah after she serves it i was. I KNOWW STOP RUBBING IT IN MY LAZY FACE 😭😭 imma try this tho
Wow!!............... https://youtu.be/sluNuVp2_TE  https://youtu.be/BYtO7iPlb5c
Very nice video. I'll definitely put this in my favorite videos and I'll be cooking the recipe this week. I'll let you know how it went.
Looks so good🤗👍I wish you live close by🤣
Yummy thank you 😋
This was super good!  If you make fresh rice just make it then let it sit for 30 min in the pot then dump it out into a bowl and let it sit a while longer to evaporate any left over water...
Love how easy you made this! Next trip to grocery store I will be trying this
when the chinese spot closes down during quarantine so you're here on youtube searching up the recipes
Corona virus got me  here! So I can  make some delicious 😋 chicken fried rice 😋 what would I cook tomorrow maybe some Mexican  or Cuban food  🤔
Brilliant 👍
Thanks for this. Needed a reminder. Making this dish for the family tonight.
I tried to make it and I mucked it up
My fav 😍😍😍
This is in the jacksepticeye visage playlist
Thank you for sharing your simple recipe. It looks delicious. I wil definitely be using this one.  Do you have a spring roll recipe which you can also share?
I literally had to clean my shirt because I drooled so much from watching this video. Not even exaggerating.
Baking “powder” or “soda” ???? You’re stating to put in baking powder because baking “soda” tenderizes the chicken??? Which one please? 🤷🏼‍♀️
If you guys didn’t look at the recipe in her bioooo, make sure to use baking soda instead of powder, she said it was an audio mistakeee 🙏
Wow, dear thats awesome, thank you for that....yummy sweetheart , I love 💘  you very much...😁
Made this and my family loved it. They ate all of it. ❤😇
Sounds good! However at first you said baking powder & then you said baking soda. Which is it? And you said green beans but it looks like green peas, Which is it? Looking forward to making this.
Never saw her cook any rice.
Finally an easy and simple recipe... were you don't have to add 15 million spices... which is also very delicious..tyfp
This is one of the best cooking videos I've seen on youtube, super straight forward with nice dashes of explanation behind why you're doing each step.
Those are sweet peas not green beans 😀
Really good fried rice. Love it
Oh my gosh I am drooling! I have to make  this for sure!
Absolutely delicious, great recipe!
I tried this and im so dissapointed.. It tasted NOTHING like even near to fried rice i order from my chinese restaurant... 1 kg food went to trash 😢😢😢
Personally I’d add my soy sauce afterwards. Also never knew there was a light soy sauce. 💡
How did u cook the rice?
Wonderful recipe!  I now use it as my base and add things to it!
I hade this and it was goood! It might be for 2 persons, but I ate it all. Especially the chicken was delicious. Some exsperience:  I didn’t have light and dark soy sauce, just the ordinary (kikkoman) It worked good for the rice.  Remember to salt it as she says. It was a bit tasteless first, but then I just added some salt and it was perfect. Just not overdo it either. I just used an ordinary nonstick pan. It worked for me. I will also next time let it sit for a few minutes on the plate next time, because it was hot. You taste it better when it is a bit chilled, but still warm enough.
Just for a clarification, you say baking powder first, then baking soda, (and I know baking soda is in baking powder) does it need the acid in the baking powder? Or doesn't it matter if you use either one?
Thumbs up
Thank you for this mouth watering recepie! Looks just like I juste like I used to have it back in S'pore. And keep up your great smile!
what kind of rice did you use for the recipe
Baking powder or baking soda !!! ??? Make up your mind,
Is there a difference in using sesame oil?
I made this today and it was delicious!! I used shrimp instead of chicken 😋😋 thank you!!
Very yummy thx so much
Thanks this was perfect!
Also add a 1/4 tsp of Sesame Oil, fot an identical take out taste!
She's adorable
That was easy!!!!
It's almost like we should be ashamed for wanting this dish given the current situation. However my husband was fortunate to see the rice on the shelf ( been out awhile) so that's tonight's dinner. I always add fresh ginger and sesame oil to mine. So good!
I loved this recipe 👌😊❤️ thanks for sharing!!!
God bless your heart 🥺💛
Better not to use a wooden cutting board for raw chicken. That said your dish looks lovely...gonna trie it soon!
Tastes like ass
I had this tonight, really tasty thank you for sharing.
Do u really got to use a day old cooked rice ?
forgot the eggs!!!
You did an amazing job. I followed your instructions and my fried rice came out to be very good. Thank you and I enjoyed your video.
I clicked off right when she made that face while tasting it
This was so much fun to make and the steps were very clear! I was pleasantly surprised that the chicken breast was tender and juicy. Thank you!
Made it today.  Wife loves it!! Says it was better than what we ate 2 weeks ago from our favorite restaurant. Doubled up but mixed the rice blend.  Got corn starch all over me when I opened it up. 😂 No wok but used a 12” deep Teflon skillet, filled it up good too!  😳 I have got to get a wok! Thank you for an easy to follow recipe 🥰
This looks great! Thanks for this awesome video ❤️
wow that's good, wonderful nice day wishes the iceman
I keep watching this but nvr had the chance to make it
So happy that I found this recipe. I am going to treat myself to the best Wok ever! I can't wait to make my own fried rice.
Loved this recipe. Tried it tonight and my super extremely fussy 3 year old boy loved it 👌🏼😊 Thank you. Will make again  ❤
Jesus loves
Yum!
Hello mam thanks for this video i've really trying this in my video #JuanDa's ph.
Too much soy salt not good for healthy at all...👎
Thank you very much, easy, no music, perfect 👌❤️
Made it and it's delicious! Added hoisin sauce. Thank you!
Thank you for shatter this yummy recipe. Looks delicious & simple to make .
I made this Chinese rice and It actually  tastes like the Chinese rice in the restaurant it  is so delicious!
This looks so yummy! Gonna try it tonight. What type of rice did you use?
Hi just looked at your cooking now. Um is the rice short gran rice or long gran rice
Ooooooo 🤤 😱
I love your knives and a wok. How do u sharpen the knives please?
Absolutely mouth watering. Great presentation. Did you say “Day old rice is best” ? I did not know that cooked rice could be re-heated !
is a wok really necessary?
Excellent instruction, delicious recipe!
AMAZING DELICIOUSNESS ...the best chicken fried rice ever...
I just want to thank you for this recipe und your guidance. I never was good at cooking but since I found this videos fried rice is now my go to dish. Thank you such much 🙏
3:22 is that rice pre cooked in any way?
It looks like Pelau
This recipe looks great for my wife she can only eat this type of food due to her illness, could I make a batch of this and freeze it?
Thank you so much. Subscribed
Great video. I can’t wait to make this dish.
This girl is so adorable and the recipe is quick, easy and delicious. I have doubled and tripled it with no problem and have even put it in a crockpot to stay warm at a party. Highly recommended! Please don’t tell her I use frozen vegetables.... where am I going in the dead of winter in the northeast?
This was awesome! Thank you. Tasted exactly like the fried rice from a good restaurant. I had struggled to copy it, now I got it thanks to you! 👍👍
my fave!!!
looks so good will try it
Ahahha thank you! Ill try it 🥳🥳🥳
Hi, you said baking powder then baking soda. Which is correct? Thank you
I love fried rice and definitely gonna try your recipe, looks delish!
I made this and it didn’t turn out too well. Maybe bc I used a diff rice.
perfect receipe thank you....
Is the rice supposed to be fresh? 🍚
I’m not so sure, so can someone tell me what’s the difference between a wok and a regular frying pan? The shape?
Firstly you are too cute 🥰 Secondly I totally put baking powder on the chicken before reading your description..... and it turned out great 😂
Oh wow this looks delicious 😋
im stuck watching fried rice videos at 3 am this quarantine is something else
Thank you for sharing this recipe 😉
can I make it with olive oil??
My stomach is starving as well,,,,I'm in the process of making this🥡
Delicious. I just subscriber to your channel. Thank you for sharing. Let be friends. Please return the love.
That looks delicious! I’m going to add a dash of fresh ginger and a teaspoon of brown sugar instead of salt and pepper.
Love your videos! You use simple ingredients. What can I use to replace soy sauce? I am supposed to stay away from salt or salty products. Thanks for your help.😊
Can I get the link to the rice she used
B
Is the rice previously boiled??
Put yo rice in da ice box over  night than so get flakey take out and mix shoyu  and season rice till rice iz all same color not blots of white so wen you cook rice it stay little bit crunchy and soft
thank you for the vid!
I'm Trying to learn Wok cooking....I don't have the heat set right. First time it was to low a setting. The next I had it on high but didn't realize a Wok gets really is super hot....over cooked. I'll keep at it though. This recipe looks good for me to try. Thanks.
Baking soda really does keeps chickem moist and juicy! That alone was worth the price of admission.
I love your videos and your voice is so calming.
Good day , love you cooking channel. Have question regarding marrinating the chicken. everytime when i use as well egg whites and i fry it, it  gets sticked to the pan. I was that wasnt the case at yours, so what am i doing wrong (wok not hoy enough, too much egg white, ....)? Keep up the good recepies :)
eating rice with a spoon?
Why add oil 3 separate times? How much oil does this dish has totally? 6 Tablespoons? Why not add eggs after tree the chicken to lessen the oil? And how much salt does this dish have on top of the 2 soysauces?  Not a diet dish for low salt diet and low oil diet but a good looking dish nevertheless.
What’s the difference between light soy sauce and dark soy sauce ??
I didn't know thier were Chinese chickens which begs to answer are thier different races of chickens running around and are there racist chickens.
You are great teacher and super chef
What is it, baking powder or baking soda? It would help if you listed the recipe along with the video as it's hard to understand you.
It looks delicious. Should I double all the ingredients if I wanted to make a larger portion of this, say double the amount?
awesome cooking,  do you have take out?
i Have  watched  Many of your vids several times...  And' they Cost me a few of Bucks!!  Bought a nice wok, and the stove top wok stand. A rice cooker,and two different kinds of rice , 25 lb  pound bags.Today, I went to the Asian store by my house  And bought all of the recommended required Sauces and misc products mentioned in some of other  vids. YET!!  I still have not made a thing!!   Getting close though.  I know it will be a complete Success. i Have you to thank for that!! I will be signing up!!
What if you dont have corn starch
I just made your Hot and Sour Soup! Amazing! The Chinese vinegar definitely made the difference! I am going to make your chicken fried rice tomorrow! Thank you!
How many servings does this make?
Lots of oil. Lots of sodium. Nice recipe though
Wow the meal look so delicious
Which rice did you use i could hear you ? Please looks amazing
What kind of rice are you using?
what does the WOK do VS a non-stick regular pan?
Thanks so much for your recipe !!!
nice noodle
Like that she doesn’t focus on herself. It’s a true instructional video with just enough personality to make it fun. 😀
green beans=peas
so good and really easy to prepare
How do I substitute shrimp for the chicken? Marinade and cook it exactly like the chicken in the recipe?
I love fried rice!! However, since I’ve lost 60+lbs on keto (and still counting) I’ve created alternative recipes to all my favs!! Cauliflower fried rice 😋 Cut the carbs and still enjoy the deliciousness https://youtu.be/UTxzOXZq1sg
我最喜欢用杀考的肉在我炒饭里。 是成都的。
Thank you got a new kind of rice to add to my cupboard.
I made this tonight and it was delicious - best fried rice ever and succulent chunks of chicken.  My family were so surprised.  Thank you for an easy to make recipe 🙏
مُشک آنست که خود ببوید نه آنکه عطار بگوید
Please create a video preparing and cooking shrimp fried rice.
The lady is using 1 Tbs of soy souse and two Tbs of another souse.  What the name of it?
I always like to add ham , leek, garlic and vet-sin to my chinese fried rice, mmmm the taste combination is wonderful, together with all the other vegetables... yummy :)
I made it and it was wonderful!  I did not have dark soy sauce, so it was not as dark as yours.  Buying some as soon as I can. I can’t wait to make it again!  Thank you!
Oh man I miss Chinese take out. First places that close sadly.
How do you stay so skinny?
Did you remember to leave out the bat?
Did you use sushi rice? Cause they are quite sticky in the video?
Anyone know if I can use some sesame or peanut oil? Great video, I am now craving this. Here in upstate NY I have to wait a bit more for my peas to come up and fresh veggies are hard to come by right now, so I will have to make due with frozen. But yours looks simply amazing! Thank you!
So simple, but sooo good.
No where near as good as my local Chinese takeaway.
Great recipe...
Can I be your boyfriend?
How much rice do you use
whats strange is seeing a Chinese lady eating with a spoon. It makes zero sense.
I just cooked this and it was wonderful. Thank you.
Thanks!
Yes, Fresh, Organic Vegetables much better
Well I know what I'm making for dinner tomorrow night
😂😂😂 I loovveee her excitement.   Ohhhh! That looks good. We almost ready😋😋😂😂.  Ohhhh yeeaaa!!
i made it! it was amazing!  thank you for sharing. i didn't have a wok, just a cast iron skillet and i will say that the cooking time for the chicken was not enough. i had to toss it back in and give it about 4-6 more minutes to brown and cook till tender.  everything else was perfect and we are definitely adding this one to our quarantine meal rotation.
I made this today and let me tell you it is the best recipe I have ever made. Finally I can make this at home. I added celery and bean sprouts too. Thank you!!
Nice wok
See I was smart at the beginning of all this and instead of hoarding dumb shit like toilet paper I got got a  container each of things like flour, corn starch, baking powder and yeast. People cant find any of that now. Bout to make some quarantine fried rice👍🍳🥣🍚
Looks delicious! love your videos <3
👍 but I think too much Oil
Your channel should be called Better than take out!! 👍😍
This is making me so hungry. I just don't have all of the vegetables.
🌺👍🏼👌🏼👍🏼🌸😍🥰😋😋😋😋
I don't understand why so many thumbs down.  It's a pretty nice recipe and if you don't want to see the video, move on, why give it a thumbs down? The recipe is easy and when it's done,  it looks delicious.
That’s a big spoon!
This is definitely the best of the 17 fried rice videos I've watched so far.
Thanks
This looks sooo good. Im going to make brown rice with general tso cauliflower (instead of chicken) and tomorrow I’ll try your fried rice with my leftover rice :)
Delicious! thank you...even better next day
She really loves that rice....
Do you use day old rice?
Did you see the Bowl that little Woman was eating out of? I dated a skinny Chick and she could out eat me, looks like she has a healthy appetite! So Adorable!
paborito ko to. alam ko na lulutuin ko bukas. ahahah
No sesame oil??!!??
I always thought peanut oil was used to give fried rice its distinctive flavor?
Made it.  Really good.  Thank you.
I don’t have dark soya sauce!! Any suggestions on what I can use instead of it??
You are awesome! Your videos are great and your recipes are so good.
Good and easy recipe. I can't wait to try it.
I like to add ginger to mine
I love the Rice fried! The best💟 thanks
Straight forward recipe and no annoying music. I will be trying this soon.
Yum!
2.2K gave this a thumbs down. What the hell is the matter with these people? Seriously. I am trying to think of a possible reason why you could take issue with this. Anyone? I got nothing.
Exactly how I make it. It is extremely delicious.
thank  you so much!!
Nice but all that fat in FOUR tbsps of oil!
in lockdown we used frozen veg , olive oil , and a couple pkts of  microwave type rice in wok pan and it was great - nice vid and you explain very well !!
No chinese anymore
Wow mgaya nga to.
Thanks sweet heart ♥️
Thank you for this recipe I came across it last week and so far I have made it with chicken and then with shrimp. This is the best recipe for fried rice, simple ingredients and seasonings. Better then carry out.  Thing I’m going to try the Easy Mongolian Beef recipe next.  Thanks again.
Very good!  By the way, the green vegetable is peas, not green beans.
Yes, she is right. It is very tasty!!!!
I love your presentation.  Your are such a beautiful lady and I love your wonderful way of expressing your recipe.  I hope you have other recipes. The fried rice looks delicious!  I can't wait to try.
Just wondering why your recipe does not include Ginger Powder?  Otherwise thanks for posting I will try it soon.
Umm can I use browning instead of soy sauce loll
No sesame oil? Also you said to add corn starch and baking powder to the chicken but then you said baking soda tenderizes the chicken breast... which one is the one to use? Baking powder or baking soda? Thanks
8
the BEST fried rice recipe.  Good job!!
Can I take the egg out the recipe or will it not taste the same
i want some😭😭😭😭😭😭
Awesome!   Thank you for this!
what do i do it i only have one type of soy sauce? how much of it would i use?
This was amazing :) I had to waste a bit more time than I usually do for preparation, but afterwards I didn´t regret. Thank you for sharing this recipie. I´m subscribing for your channel :)
Looks delicious.
tysm, i am using this for a procedure for my school project.
Scrumptious dish. And the fried rice looks good too.
I need that knife. Where’d you get it
Going to make it tomorrow
Awesome!! Simple and delicious 😋
Just wanted to say i made it right now with this recipe. And i turned out  absolutely delicious 😋 I recommend it 👌🍛
Very nice 😀👍
Was trying to find a kids version without chilli. This is perfect with dark sauce and soy sauce. Cooking it til it burn abit makes it a little tastier.
Great!
I'm a little confused is it baking powder or baking soda??
I could spend hours watching you cook! This recipe looks so delicious!
OMG I love it
This looks like the fried rice I'm used to! Where was videos like this when I had a Chinese boyfriend!? Lol
Beautifully seasoned wok!
Try to speak English better
Can you use an electric skillet?
Nice job, beautiful presentation. Please visit my channel. I am new on YouTube and have a cooking channel just like this. Please subscribe
She sounds so cute how excited she’s getting. It’s getting me excited to make it😁
Made this yesterday and it was a hit. I didn’t have the two types of soy sauce, so I used dark soy sauce and fish sauce. So freakin’ good. Thank you!!
Thank you for the outstanding recipe(s). I am obliged to make this one (Chicken Fried Rice) without the  cornstarch and baking soda, not having a decent wok at the moment. Still works well, I think.  Some hot/hour or egg-drop soup on the side...</eat>
I make a similar dish whenever I don't know what to make but have plenty of bits in the fridge. Sometimes I will use the flavored rice packages (Rice-a-roni) and while that or any rice is cooking, will have 2 deep pans like woks going - one to store and mix the cooked foods and one to cook each thing separately in. It is different every time because of what I choose to use or have on hand - sauteed canned mushrooms with butter and garlic, thin slices of weiners, or small strips of luncheon meat like Spam, can of cut green beans, cross cut small bits of celery, cabbage shreds, bits of green yellow or red peppers, bean sprouts, carrots, peas, finely cut leftover meats from fridge, onions or garlic, scrambled eggs just like this example, bits of bacon cut thinly, and any thing you can think of that you like separately. It will mix in with other things well. It is so easy to make a huge batch and store in containers in the fridge or freezer and then microwave to heat up. I spice it up with a little soya sauce and often use a separate dish of stir fry beef that I have marinated with garlic, soya sauce, sesame oil,  pepper, and tapioca starch so it makes a thick 'gravy like sauce' (add more water and stir up well if the tapioca starch has jelled the sauce too much), it will thin out nicely. The end result is good if you have a lot of color and an assortment of slightly fried browned meats to crunchy foods like the celery that has been sauteed. Thanks for reminding me of one of my favorite fast dish foods (20 minutes and it is all done). While you are frying up one or two similar ingredients, you are preparing or chopping the next to go in. This is the perfect late night snack or isolation dish.
She said “Beat it well”🤣🤪
Yep cooked this tonight, very tasty, I may have overdone the rice though, it will get better with practice. Highly recommend.
I love how everyone decides to make fried rice during quarantine
So easy to make. Thanks. Almost exactly the way I do it except for the baking soda (didn't know about that one) and the corn starch which I use when I make Lo Mein to create a rather thicker sauce. By the way, I love Chinese food but I stop eating out one day I bought fried rice at this place in Puerto Rico and didn't noticed they had given me shrimp which I'm allergic to. I had recently arrived from NYC where I used to buy Chinese all the time and didn't know shrimp was included in the order. I was so pissed cause I was so hungry and tired, and didn't feel like cooking cause it was late. I ended up eating a sandwich.
Mine came out terrible.. all mushy i need more practice
Hopefully mine turns out like yours!! Thank you so much for the recipe !
Tried this at it was delicious
She says "spatular" like Mr. Krabs @ 3:51
Just made it and It tasted so good. Simple Instructions that anyone can make it. Thank you.
I love Chinese for, thank you
I'm going to try this. Looks just great. My wife is now a Egg Foo Young believer as well as Gung Pow Chicken lover. I have a few kids that do yard work for me and I usually fix them lunch. They will be getting an Asian surprise this week. You are the best. Are you still living in South America??? Thank you, CB
Basically it's soaked in salt, any chance you can make something tasty that doesn't contain salt, or very little?
better than take out indeed! i can smell it from my home away form home yummy this fired rice wow sissy

I made it, I made it !! It was great. Thank you. COVID 19- our Chinese restaurants are closed, not even takeout. Will try Orange chicken next. 💕
Love that you list all the ingredients in the description, thanks for the recipe!! 😍
It was two thirty in the afternoon and I thought to myself I am going to make your chicken fried rice, well self isolation why not. Thank you it was so awesome, my son ate three bowls of it, I ate two, so stuffed now. Zzzzzzzz snooze time.
Love it 😊
What kind of rice did you use?
I just made this and its better than takeout hands down!! And I suck at cooking. I didnt have light soy sauce, only the cheap off brand regular soy sauce and it worked perfectly fine. Just use a non stick skillet and you're good.
Baking powder or baking soda? You said both?
Ran into this video at 9am and by 1230 noon I am in heaven.   Simple and easy and satisfying.   I added a few lobster pieces with the chicken and it was even better
That looks great.  (I'd cut out the eggs.)
God Bless America.
Absolutely going to make this. Thank you for sharing my friend
🤣🤣👍🏾
Thank you sooo much!!!❤❤
Woo  love  rice
👍
You don't use sesame oil? Not everyone likes it, but I think it really elevates the flavor. Thanks for the simple recipe!
Wow. I think this is the most beautiful fried rice I have ever seen.
Main article live bat guts virus sauce and dog brain
🤤🤤🤤🤤
That looks so delicious.
Looks so Tasty!=D
It looks DELICIOUS!!!
Congrats for your video, you made it very simple and amazing..Love it...I bet if you add to that some shrimps..wowowww...❤️😘❤️
Made it . It was lovely....🇯🇲
Anyone bored during quarantine?
You're kinda hawt ♥️😁
I gave this a go today loved it thanks.
You are so cute. Looks delicious!
Great job on your English!
"Thank you!.
looks good
I don't have one day old rice would it work
Can't wait to try . It looks so good !!
The most important tip is the RICE! Pls use overnight rice only. Do not use fresh steamed rice as the rice grains have too much moisture content and too starchy for stir fry. The rice will clump and stick together in lumps.
Add a bit of covid-19
*She sounds like Sandara Park lol*
...and cheek bones!  She can cook for me anyday!
Nice hair cut !
Looks great.
Looks so good.  I love Chinese cuisine.
Fuck anything Chinese. I’m never going to eat or buy anything Chinese ever again!
goes good with bat soup
Excellent video, looks scrumptious. Will make this week.
Um can you send me a bowl? Lol
Is it ok if I don't add light soy sauce
CHINESE NO WAY
Time to go make lunch, lol
Hello guys, can i use a “normal pan” instead of that she is using? I live in the Europe and we dont have here those pans.
Except chickens are people and shouldn’t be eaten as farming them leads to plagues like avian influenza
Beats cooks bats and dogs
Sexy in those glasses !
Love how u cook this
tried to call you a recipe I must have done something wrong because my chicken and vegetables made a bunch of extra liquid in the pan don't understand why someone could explain I greatly appreciate some insight then we did not have day-old rice made rice the same day and it came out very mushy and liquidy
This is good. Since covid19, we've decided we are gonna Quit eating Chinese takeout/Rest. Never could quite figure out the "Mystery Meat Anyway.  now with all this talk about bats, starting the disease, some in China eating them 😝😜😝😜🤤😲. Nope, done. Not being racist or anything like that. ppl in All parts of the world eat different things, but not all create disease. BATS are diseased  like rats, plus rabies. Naw, IM GOOD.  steak, hot dogs hamburgers, chicken. and sometimes I wonder bout that.
I’m going to make this right now I’m starving all of a-sudden thanks to you with your nerdy cute self! Lol!
https://youtu.be/OX4MSMMdDjY
ChickEty-China, the Chinese Chicken
This has to be the best fried rice . I ever seen
Replace soy sauce with fish sauce, curry powder and turmuric and voilá; you've got yourself some Nasi Goreng.
This isn't Jacksepticeye's visage gameplay o_O is it? 🤔
I'm gonna try it out.Looks yummy!
So that was enough time to cook the chicken from raw too thorough?  Not trying to question you in a rude way, just making sure because chicken always makes me nervous lol.
Man U sound like cardi b, fry rice look 🔥
Of all the Asian cooks on Youtube I think you are the best and the easiest!!
Can't wait to try.
Can't wait to try.
Check this out     https://youtu.be/BY3EVlE8wig
I love Souped up Recipes
Best recipe - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swih43bv3aw
Is baking soda the same as bi carbonate soda?
chop sticks please
Thanks for this. My fried rice game is off the hook bc of this video! I find using basmati rice works best for me.
Have you ever done video showing how you make rice
My family loved it. than you for posting such a delicious dish. :D
some say she's still adding oil to this day
i am the only one in our house that will eat asian food - now i think my wife has been convinced to eat it aswell ......well done! - it is better than take out
Hey, yeah it looks super yummy, however what about the green peas aren’t they still hard to chew?? What status are they right before adding them to the wok?? Thanks and keep it up
You forgot to add some bat 🦇
Well done - thanks for sharing 👍
Did u wash your hands after touching those salmonella sticks? 🤣🤣
made this for my boo thing n he loved it 🖤🖤🖤😓
a big bowl for some one so tiny.   lol...... I been wanting some rice today but didnt have it
Good job Ling Ling!! 💯👍🔥
Really delicious!!!
Recipe was really good! I subbed pork for chicken and edamame for peas, really delicious!
Looks scrumptious!
I want to love it but with less oil
Can you just pug 3 tablespoon of regular soy sauce because I don't have dark or light soy sauce
What type of rice did you use? Long grain or short? Could brown rice replace the white? I recently discovered your videos, and appreciate how easy you have made these recipes. Last week I tried your chicken and brocolli recipe. It was easy to make and delicious as well!
No good!
mmmmmmmmmmmm yum
It does look good but there is only one problem- most people do not have the time to cook virtually every item separately and finally mixed it all together just to call it a FRIED RICE.
I just restored an old Wok, just in time!
Great Video! Looks so good, I will be using your method. Thx!
Looks good!  Subscribe to my channel Anna Maria Mulè for some more easy recipes
Oh my gosh, now I'm starving!  :)
Wow, looks delicious!
I must admit the first time I watched this channel was because you were just so PRETTY, but then I tried making this fried rice recipe. it turned out PRETTY good. I am a terrible cook but this was easy enough even for me to follow. Going to work on the Kung Pao chicken next.
She like using the wrd "good"
Looks wonderful!
I occasionally make fried rice, but I’m definitely going to make this recipe soon. It looks delicious! Your videos are well-produced, your voice and personality endearing. So, I subscribed.
Great video and great recipe. Thank you.
I have no idea how I got here but wow looks amazing I will have to cook it tomorrow!! Thank you!!👍👍👍👍❤
U are cute the way to presented :)
Loved this recipe! Did it with shrimp onstead of chicken and added oyster sauce to the rice.
Her English is a lot better than my Chinese.
I have just made this today and it came out so nice!! Thank you so much. Very easy to follow and passed the family taste test. Next time I might add some chilli flakes for those who like a kick but all the flavours balance so well and defo tastes like take out but better! Looking forward to trying more recipes. :) Thank you :)
Pork fried rice is my favorite! I used your recipe just substituted cooked pork..you are absolutely right...it is soooo good 🤤Thank you God bless 💚👵
Your missing cashews
Can't wait to try this! Thank you😊
Great recipe and simple ,i never knew eggs were used in chicken fried rice but i certainly will try it ...thanks for your great video.
You are such a cutie! I'm definitely doing this recipe - thanks for posting!
What’s a substitute for soy sauce?
Eating with a spoon and not chopsticks?
i love this cooking then we will not buy anymore outside.
How can anybody give this sweet thing a thumbs down?? I guess they don’t like delicious food because I’ve made your fried rice several times .. Everyone I make it for says it’s the best fried rice they ever had 😋😋😋😋 Keep the good work and God Bless you and your family.
You are the best :)
Is this the way it's made when I order takeout?
Can you double the recipe?
but it never tastes like the restuarant, how can we make it just like they do?
中国炒饭很好吃 😋
Cuban food
The chef need more experience  how to make fried rice the right way
Yum, thank you, will give it a try. I normally buy it!
How do you stay so skinny eating this way?  What is your secret?
So 😋
yyum
Trust me this shit takes too long
Your instructions were very simple even an idiot like me can create this sumptuous dish. Thanks for sharing
I like how you keep it simple without having a 5 minute conversation with yourself before the actual instructions. This is a great recipe for self quarantine.
She is adorable
I like your spirit and personality.
You are wonderful.
I subscribed because my children love Chinese food 🥘
That looks SO AMAZING!
Soy sauce is sweet or salty?
Typically spot on..xxx 😋
looks delicious!
Looks very good I will definitely try it!
👍👍👍🐓🐓
Looks delicious!
Most Chinese restaurants make dog food style fried rice. So its easy to make good stuff at home.
Look nice but I'm sure test shit
Great job.  Thank you
I smell bat wings
I love 😘👌
Man she just gonna eat it in front of us?!
Thank you
Thank you for the recipe.  I will make it for my family as soon as I purchase a real wok and wok spatula.
You do no that baking powder and soda are not the same thing?? right
is it baking powder or baking soda? which is correct ?
While in self-isolatuon, I was searching for an easy recipe and found this. It's perfect for the situation. Simple ingredients and can be cooked quickly. Thanks! I hope you and your family is safe in China 🙏🏼 stay safe
Now I can eat Chinese food thank you
let me be the judge what i like and what you like is 2 different things
that looks delicious......how about adding some peanuts to it maybe? cashews?
No 🥕! 🤢
Mmmmm new subscriber gonna try this thank you!
I made this dish as instructed and it was better than my local Chinese restaurant. Thank you.
Poor thang... she looks like she starving
🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽😭🙏🏽 GOD BLESS YALL THANK U
I've always enjoyed your show. It is especially valuable now that we're staying home! Thank you 🥘
You said baking powder and then you said baking soda.
I love your Chanel and I like how you explain thank you so much  I tried it it was delicious my husband love it 😍

Looks AMAZING!! just showing some love from The Kool Zone feel free to stop by!! ❤
You are soo cute!
I've been on a quest to make the perfect fried rice at home, and this is by far the best recipe I've tried! Thank you so much!
Looks good.....And she's so cute!
Hi good morning, how did you  cook  the  rice ???
wow looks delicious
Just subscribed after watching this video.  Thanks a bunch!
There is literally no difference between fresh and frozen.
I have made this three times now.  Always comes out perfect.  Only thing I do different is use just dark soy sauce as I cannot get light in my area.  Keep the videos coming.  Love your recipes.
I made this yesterday according to this recipe. It came out REALLY Delicious! My Filipina wife loved it.  Thank you! I added a teaspoon of sesame oil to the veg oil for flavor.  Next time I'll make the rice first in a different pan because my wok has a two-level bottom; this caused some problems with mixing the sauce and frying. 70 year old Irish/American man, amateur chef.
Good job on this video . Can't wait to try this
Made this following the exact directions and it turned out amazing! Thanks!
Well done.
After watching your video, I wanted some of that Fried Rice.  So, my wife is making it today for lunch from your recipe.  I can't wait to try!
I am making it right now
Trying too hard.
♥️
New SUB! You're cooking is 🔥🔥🔥😋😁
We indonesian add garlics and shallot before the chicken and minced garlic at the end before remove from heat. We don't use dark soy sauce.. the dark soy in here is very sweet and not suit for fried rice. But it is nice to see other culture sharing another fried rice recipe.
What is dark soy sauce? I can’t find any at the store can you recommend some
Yum Yum ! l also have a delicious simple chicken fried rice recipe up on my channel, come and check it out
I just finished eating a hamburger about 20 minutes ago but oddly, I find myself hungry again.
Damn you, I broke my teeth trying to eat my PC screen.  😍😂❤❤
This is even better than take out at an chinese restaurant. Yummy! 😋👍

Looks delicious 😁
哈哈哈你真的挺可爱的
You’re so cute! Great video
Looks delicious will definitely be trying this recipe. Thanks ❤
She is very good, no fake attitude, but real!
Why am i watching this at five in the morning?!!  Mental
It Is BeTtEr WiTh FrEsH OnEs, TrUsT Me
Great recipe and video. I tried it and she was right. Excellent dish! Thank you.
ok first she says a pinch of baking powder for the chicken but then when she is stirring to cover the chicken she says baking soda?  Which is it?
Freakishly large spoon.😂
Looks like MaMas good job 👍🏾
That was GREAT, y'all hookeD that fried rice uP 👍🏼
wow just amazing at this quarantined condition love it
Look very delicious..
This is so wholesome 👏🏾 your hair is very pretty btw, I can't make bangs work for me no matter what 😭 wish mine were like yours
The best fried rice recipe I've seen, and I've seen a couple...simple and well explained. Thank you!!
I would love to learn how to make different kinds of meals from every country I get tried of making the same food
Hi thank you for a great video and a delicious recipe— subscribed today 😊
Wow!!!!! Now I can make my own fried rice. Thank you for showing how to make one of my favorite chinese dishes.
Oh my God, wife, wife... where have you been all my life !?!
The “ohhhh yeeaaauuuhhhh” sent me 😂 but loved this video so genuine! Definitely going to give this a try!
Isn't it salty? Salt is not needed because soy sauce is already salty.
You are soooo precious 💕
Thanks looks so good I’m a try this tomorrow
better to leave the rice untouched for a couple mins after adding so it gets crusty and almost burns.  then stir it and let it sit again.  Then season and add the other ingredients.
How to make corona virus
Very simple steps. I love this video. I'm going to be making fried rice for the first time ever.
Thanks for the recipe! Turned out great.
Also, curious, what would you suggest for a vegetarian instead of chicken? (Chicken + turkey have been the ONLY meat I have eaten for the last 15 yrs but would like to not use them.) so as far as texture wise, what would you suggest as best?!
You’re making my mouth water soooo much!!!! I cannot wait to try THIS recipe, no offense, but I was looking for someone who has more of a well educated background with fried rice! Thank you, thank you, THAAANK YOOOU!!!  Ill be making this Friday for lunch, (with enough to keep for leftovers!)  Is there anywhere you’d like me to share this at?! I’d be more than happy to share!
Love the wok! Looks well-seasoned!
mmmmm at the End :D
Thanks for the video. It’s look so easy to cook.
No way ....I was exactly thinking of making fried rice...n I saw this things appeared when I opened YouTube...This thing can read my mind
I tried your approach and it worked a treat!!  I'm hooked.  Will be doing this dish with minor variations from now on.  Thank you !!!!
Chinese recipe ! 🦇 🐸!
Do you have a receipt for 🍚 ?
Made this twice in the last two weeks. It’s delicious. I use book choy as well.
Thank you !
Great tutorial adding a few more ingredients to mines. I love it with fresh ginger.
Wow that looks good!
Excellent!. Very good instructions. Now I am hungry Haha.
Thank you for the video, I’ll be giving this a try, usually do a different recipient so excited to taste the difference
This reminds me of cooking mama ❤️
Nice.good job
Now I'm hungry 😂
So, that is one serving. If you double the amounts (to serve two people), how does that affect cooking times.
Making this tonight. Ps. Subbed
My mouth is watering.
U forgot to add bat broth
@ Souped up recipes: which wok do you recommend? Please give us a link to a great safe wok (one that’s not coated with weird stuffs).
In your work instructions it says to set aside chicken mixture for 30mins but this is a 15min recipe. Is that required?
Great video and great recipe. Thank you!
Six table spoons of oil in one dish ! Fat and yummy !
I’ve never had fried rice with carrot.  It’s very hard and takes forever to soften.
everything you cook looks so delicious
She is so pretty
Greetings to You Chef! Your fried rice recipe👍 Thanks for sharing...
Yes, "I see the shiny brown color."  I bet it's "really good."  Great tutorial!
There's something about watching her eat...
Not a great way to cook fried rice
She is so cute!!!
What if you dont have light soy sauce?
Supporting you 🤝
Thanks so much for explaining this so well,  so very organized and simple.    You have made my mouth water!
Yum looks good and I can eat it but have to use gluten free soy sauce.
No msg
Glad I found this.
spatcular haha
My favorite rice dinner recipe 🍊🦇😍☯️🐸❤🈷️🇨🇳Easter and Tao long story .🌌
Great video. Straight to the point and no annoying background music.  I will try this.  Thanks.
I just bought a wok, I'll have to give making this a go.
Now, I’m hungry again, even though I’ve eaten! Looks so tempting...
This is what I do in the morning when ate rice the day before the egg makes the dish
Looks good but too much salt plus the sodium from the soy sauces.
Yummy .Thanks
Thanks for this. I’ll try tomorrow night. 👍😀
The recipe calls for 150 grams of chicken.  That’s only 1/3 lb.  That can’t be right.  How much does everyone use?
Looks like only enough for two people. The recipe doesn't say how many servings it makes.
I made this tonight.  Everyone loved it! I did add a pinch of red pepper flakes to chicken marinade.
Too oily just for rice and chicken
Is it baking powder or baking soda you use?
5:37 A-Mei-Zing! lol           Like if you know where that reference is from.
No ginger or sesame oil??🤔
in the recipe you mention green beans but you used green peas...is that correct?
I'm now hungry😩😩😭😭😁😁😊😊
Looks delicious! Can you use canola oil as a substitute for vegetable oil? Just curious. Thank you 🙂
Looks fabulous! I have to try this!
Can't tell if she's 14 or 40.
Yummy I will definitely try this
Almost midnight here in Brazil. I'm going to give it a try. BtW loooove your accent.
I hope she is over 18, because you know why!
Yummyness
Xb. C
what ? no sesame oil !?
I just tried this last night and it was the BEST fried rice I’ve ever made! I will definitely be using this recipe every time from now on
Looks great! Mixing the fried rice in the other ingredients is perfect!
Wow love this recipe. It looks delicious. Thank you.
Made this today. Didn't have light soy sauce used a little more dark soy instead. It was amazing!! Thank you for this recipe!! Wish I could post a picture to show you!!
Remember our jambalaya recipe....with the polish sausage and tomatoes too that was a favorite for year
Great video! New sub
I bought your wok on Amazon and cooked your chicken fried rice---it was really so good!!!! :) Thank you!
Aw hell nah, I'm NOT eating Chinese food without chopsticks! Takes the fun out of it for me 😊
TFS
I hope you are safe from Corona virus 😣
this is so wholesome
Differently GOING to try to make this looks delicious 😀 but am adding shrimp 🍤 INSTEAD but first go buy a wok than u very much beautiful lady
Why say OMG????
Thank you for this recipe.  Tastes like my favorite 40 something years ago.  Finally learned how to make it like that.
Yum!
I'd eat that all night, rice isn't bad either
You're so small but with big appetite! :)
Check out D9 beats for free music for your videos
I have been watching you cook so many of my favorite dishes and I am about to start drooling all over myself LOL oh goodness I hope your Husband appreciates all the goodies you can cook wow keep up the great cooking  ;-) Pat
Looks delicious, can’t wait to make this!
I am so confused. I can easily learn your martial arts if I copy it. But I am struggling still trying to learn to make Chinese food. Lol.  I only know how to make the beef broccoli and chrimp broccoli.   ## I want Chinese food now. I'm gonna pout like a 2yr old in 2 second.   ## for ever young.   Lol😁😂😂😢😄.
amazing recipe, Simple, authentic and so tasty, i used sesame oil to the chicken marinade and peanut oil for the wok turned out extraordinary.
Holy shit! If I don't get to eat it right now, I will DIE
Okay when we get married. LOL
Woman: This chicken fried rice recipe takes 15 minutes to make.  Also Woman: - Cut the chicken into small pieces. Mix it with 1 tsp of corn starch, 1 tsp of soy sauce, 1 tsp of vegetable oil and a pinch of baking soda. Set it aside for 30 minutes.    No wonder men can never understand women
welp craving this now, time to go make myself some chickeen fried rice
You really a gas stove for this. Otherwise you get Chicken with smushy porridge.
Lady, I just had to write you and thank you for sharing your skills with the rest of us. I just got through making your Chicken fried rice recipe and it turned out awesome. I didn't have fresh vegetables. So I used Frozen And I only had light soy sauce But as I said, it turned out great And once again, I'd like to say, thanks. I think you're awesome. And I hope you keep up your Channel.
Is that a cast iron wok? I really get inspired by your amazing videos. Thank you so much!!! Please , if anyone can reply with what is best type of wok and tools to use for maximum flavor and also I have and electric stove top. I’m not sure if that matters. Thank you all in advance! Have a great day!
Love it so much thank for sharing, watching here in UK. 👍👍👍❤️❤️
Thank you for this recipe. Looks yummy. Is it baking powder or baking soda you use? You mentioned baking powder first, but then you said baking soda. Thanks
I made this with mushrooms instead of chicken - I dont use chicken because they are treated so cruelly.  It was delicious.
Looks good but salty
Just made this! Super delicious!
I like the way she gives @6:29  thumbs up...so, I gave her one too
I'm going to try to make this tonight. Looks easy enough and I need easy!
No peas and no carrots please.
ভালো হইছে,  আফা আফনারে ধইন্যবাদ।  রাত ২.৩০ মিনিটে দেখতেছি ঘুমানোর টাইমে, আফসোস!  বালা থাইকেন।
thats nice thank you. I would eat that morning and nite
sure it does taste better with fresh veggies but a lot of places dont sell fresh veggies, the ones in the supermarket are not fresh veggies guys, those vegetables that you buy are usually pulled either very early in their life or are in transport for weeks so when it gets to the market they look fresh but they actually arent, frozen veggies are actually more fresh than supermaket vegetables because they freeze them as soon as they're ready
Great video and recipe. I made your fried rice for dinner and my husband and I loved it!! Thank you!😁
Made this at the weekend, large frying pan, electric hob. Delicious. Thank you!
Tried today, excellent. Used broccoli instead of peas. In addition added little splash of black vinegar when saucing rice with light and dark soy. When finishing with green onion also added little sesame oil.
ALWAYS WASH HANDS BEFORE BEGINNING ANY MEAL.
What about the MSG?
first time I give a thumb up in a heartbeat
Finally something easy.  All those other Chinese made easy but takes over hours to make.
You used some dark soy for that beautiful dark color to finished product. That makes you my hero. I was basically raised by Cantonese family here in Virginia. They had a restaurant back in the 80's, and your fried rice looks exactly like they would make it.  Perfection : )

I made this for dinner last night. Used matchstick carrots, green onions, and broccoli as my veggies. It was so good! I will definitely be making again! ❤️
Love the videos Souped.  😊😚
My husband and I made this and oh my God, you’re a life saver. So nice to not have to go out and much better than restaurants. You’re awesome.
I made this yesterday and YES it is as good as you say . . . me & my family LOVED IT!!! =]
Looks great! This will be the first recipe we make in our new wok
Looks delicious although my only reservation is that you shouldn’t allow the oil to smoke as it releases harmful toxins.
Just made this and I turned out great.  Thanks for sharing.
I made this tonight also. It is better than any restaurant...so good!!!yum
Rice is too stodgy
😋😋😋😋😋😋😋
Omg , just had 2000 calories for lunch 😭 🤤
ok..i take u as wife, but first we change hair and makeup. cooking very good.
You first say add backing powder, but then you talk about baking soda (NaHCO3).  So which one is it?
I like her attitude and cooking spirit. It could brighten up a person's day. This video was absolutely purrrfect.
Asian girls are cute af.
Dinner tonight thanks
I like to add just a touch of sesame oil to your recipe.  Just gives it that something, something.   Thank you.
a game changer in adding some flavor in this recipe is adding a teaspoon of Chinese five spice to the chicken. Trust me. It's amazing. I didn't have the dark soy sauce, the regular kind worked perfect. There weren't fresh peas at my grocery store, so I used snapped peas and de-shelled them. Came out amazing. I even doubled the recipe, and it came out amazing. Now i need to buy a wok like yours, what kind would you recommend? My chicken didn't turn dark brown though, maybe I should have fried it longer.  Thank you so much! i will be making this often.
Looks delish!!!!!!
So much oil in one meal, I think most burns away so you don't get to eat it. It looks very tasty. 🍲🥣🥢Gonna give this a go.
Marry me, Have my babies!!! lol great wok, I mean Work
Oh lord.. delishhh...
Looks so yummy!! Thanks for the great video, also your accent is so adorable 😩
I made this just now! So good!!
I didn't have chicken or fresh veggies on hand but I used pork in place of the chicken & some frozen stir fry veggies minus the egg & rice. Hands down the very best homemade pork & veggie stir fry I have ever made all thanks to you! My family LOVED it & I will be fixing it for all the guys at the firestation where my husband is stationed. This is now going to be a weekly staple recipe for us.
love your recipes keep doing a good job
Can’t wait for when I get my gas cooker to make this on a wok. Induction hobs just don’t cut it
Lovely recipe. Just a word of caution. The surface that you chopped the raw chicken is the same surface you placed the bowl afterwards. Presumably (during the edit) you cleaned the surface after chopping if not, the bottom of the bowl will transfer the raw chicken to other surfaces. I'm confident you did, but it's always worth mentioning it to viewers to protect them and to cover your self.
Do you need a husband ?
Very nice approach. I tried your  methods and the food was a wonderful outcome. Cheers!
What type of rice did you use?  I couldn’t quite understand what you said .... Thanks
When we do fried rice at home I cut the carrots into thin strips, I use brown onion instead of red, I use frozen baby peas (thawed) and I use high quality oyster sauce (I use the Mega-Chef brand- they use more natural ingredients) and some home made stock with the veges. I use Braggs all purpose seasoning or liquid aminos which are basically soy sauce- but no GMOs or nasty chemicals added. I try to use more seasoning and less soy because soy isn't good for you consumed in large quantities.  I also find if I fry the rice in batches in my non stick electric wok, it doesn't stick at all so I use less oil (no matter how much I season my steel wok, or how much oil I put in- rice still  sticks in it). And I make myself an oil mixture by adding half and half pure beef dripping with coconut oil and a little sesame for flavor. I melt it and set it aside to use. I then use the sesame oil by itself near the end when I've mixed all the rice, egg and veges together. Our fried rice is better than anything we can buy at a takeout place or restaurant, and it does so many meals. It's even nice cold.
Oh and you're HOT
just what i was looking for looks awesome got a feeling mine wont look like that
Vegetable oil has no vegetables in it and is not healthy. Better to use coconut or organic olive oil.
I cook fried rice and I was surprised my husband love it ,, he says so delicious ,,,I love Chinese food I was working in Hongkong for over 20 yrs and now I'm married American man so I tried to cook Chinese foods and let him tried to eat some ,,
Tasted great! Thanks. Easy to do.
My mouth is watering...Mmm!!
I wish everyone spoke english with her adorable accent.
I need to marry a Asian women best way to my heart
It does look scrumptious!!!!
I LOVE IT .
Your English is beautiful!
Everyone talking about how good this looks,I'm here still stuck on the fact that she called peas green beans.
Where the hell was I at to marry this woman?!
Also thank you for making it simple and easy
I'm so excited I am making this right now for lunch a late lunch thank you for sharing and
I used this and it turned out awesome 😎!Thank You
do you not use msg
Easier to cut if chilled maybe even slightly frozen on outside. It can defrost after chopping while you do vegied. Substitute orange sauce for a change.
This is how videos should be. Straight to the point in seven minutes or less. Nice.
Somehow your manner is so lovely I feel like I am at a friends house. That means you have won youtube.
Awesome recipe, I cant wait to try it.
That looked soooooooo gooood!! I gotta put my onions & peppers in first not last , I like my onions fried hard🥡🥢
Do you used parboiled rice or regular rice?
Girl!!!! This is delicious!  Thank you so much for sharing this.
What sort of rice is this.
That answers the age old question....which came first the chicken or the egg!
New England has the best Chinese food. Mass.,nh,vt etc. Rice is dark. This sure looks like it. Wonder if she from up there?
Hy l am one of your subscribers l am cooking for about 60 are more people how do l measure the recipe out to make it
now my question is out of topic, how do you stay slim if all the foods are delicious😍
Usually the garlic goes in after the most dense vegetables are already softened because it burns easier and will ruin your dish with bitterness.
I seen Woks On Sale at Wal-Mart. I'm going to get me one just to make Asian dishes in. This looks super delicious.
You are sweet and cute!! I will make it sweets!!
I love this video ,you were great  💕
This looks amazing and delish!!! Thank you for sharing!!!
Made this dish tonight and it was delicious! This is the second of your recipe's that I've completed; more to come! One tip for others new to your wonderful recipe's- start about 45 mins early for the dishes- the chicken needs to marinate for about 30 min prior to the rest of the recipe assembly. Thank you so much Mandy!!
Made this in Ireland. It was absolutely delicious!
This is exactly how a cooking video should be. A great recipe with simple ingredients. No irritating background music and a cheerful and happy smiling presenter. I love stir fry.
Love this .. now where to get a good wok? I have one but its a cheepy one ~  what do you recommend?
which rice is best to use to make this dish?
Your voice is spoiling annoying!
Oh man I gotta get a wok lol 😁 that looks so delicious!!
That beautiful wok....
Omg! Made this rice 🙌🏻
I could almost smell it! The way you cook eg. Stirring, etc., makes me think you've cooked in a restaurant at some point?!
Great!  I’ll put 5 spice powder! Thanks!🎉
That’s a lot of oil
ThankYou !
She's cute puts pride in her cooking. I would like to end this dish with a touch of peanut sauce for flavor
What soy sauce
Very nice
Rice is too clumpy, i always use a boil in the bag basmati and undercook by 1 or 2 mins, let it go cold and it breaks apart in grains real nice, your rice is just way too clumped together.
Definitely will try this. Yum
thumbs up for the sword from bleach
Thank you for this in 2020
I think you forgot to mention that the rice is cooked the day before then dried in the refrigerator overnight.
I.ruv.yooooo.you.sre.vey.good.cook.xxxx😄😃
Please tell me, was the white rice boiled before frying? Thank you.
Yummy! Yummy! Yummy! Thank you! Be happy! 💜
My earphones really went ⬅️⬇️⬇️↘️➡️↗️⬆️
😋😎
I thought in the United States the Chinese restaurants use pigeons instead of chicken in there stirfry
No sesame seed oil or bean sprouts?
Delicious recipe!!! Thank you for sharing. I just subscribed! 💜
Thanks for sharing this recipe.  Looks great!  Can't wait to give it a shot!
holy crap just pour a quart of oil down your throat...thats why all these koreans in jack shacks have food belly's
Made this for me and my bride of 39 years!!! Scored serious brownie points, she loved it!!!! Thanks!
I need a Chinese wife
Awesome job!
I like to use Chinese Five Spice.
Looks delicious! Thanks for posting cute girl.
Your Chinese Chicken Fried Rice looks really delicious, but you also look delicious too. RU single?
I'm hoping you have a video on how to make rice lol!! Specifically your kind of sticky rice. I know how to make the fluffy kind 😝
Looks amazing. Girl you get down cooking. It's not just putting things together its knowing exactly when to put them together. I'm gonna make this. Thsnks
This is so basic. She’s very easily pleased.. and annoying.
It looked like green peas but you mentioned green beans.  Was that beans or peas?
Will you marry me?
Burnt eggs, no thanks.
You don t need to add salt. The soy sauce is already salty.
The most important part of this video she omits.  You will follow this and wonder why yours is not the same.  You need day old rice.  You need to cook the rice 1 day ahead and put into fridge to start drying out a bit.    This is the secret to good friend rice.  She even uses day old rice in the video.  If you try to make fried rice with freshly made rice it wont work.  Okay she just said it 2sec after my comment but she did not make you understand this is not an option it is a step.
Why would you add peas at the same time as carrots and onions?  Makes no sense unless you like over cooked mushy peas in your rice.
Make sure you place your mixing bowl on the same board you cut your chicken so you can spread salmonella around the kitchen.
Never trust a skinny cook.
Rice is too dark.... Obvious sign of being heavy handed with the soy.
Its 1:18 in the morning and im hungry
Now I want some Shrimp Fried Rice 😋🍤🍚🥡🥢
Leave chickens alone...
Amazing video thanks 4 the upload ..I'm gonna make it 👍
She missed one very important ingreedient.  Scallions !!!   Cut about 1" long strips and add in.
Yumm
Very clear instructions, thank you
Spatuler
Too much attention; too much time; too much salt;  too much oil;  prefer imported brown Thai rice.   Good Chinese takeout much easier; tastes pretty good; not expensive!
Thank you for this Recipe this will be the First thing I try with my Home Made Wok. Can't wait for the next Recipe.
Thanks sister! Looks good! Very simple to make. Great job and thanks for sharing!
you forgot the ginger
Why did i enjoy watching this cute and enthusiastic Asian woman cook so much?
that amazon link is not the Wok you used
Fried rice has no carrots you should know that Chinese person
It does looks delicious baby, but I didn't get the rice brand.
ur so cute but i had to eliminate carrots n added mushrooms for a savory taste. sooo tasty
Must try thanks you
Do you cook on high heat?
It is a prohibition of blasphemy, specifically, the misuse or "taking in vain" of the name of the God of Israel, or using His name to commit evil. Exodus 20:7 reads: "Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain." (KJV).
Excellent!!! Thank You Very Much!!!
I don't know why I thought stir fried rice was complicated!!  This looks simple, absolutely doable and delicious.
This is the best recipe presentation on whole YT! It was not only mouthwatering ....
Thank you! It's looks really delicious!
Looks so good and seems so easy! I would also add a few drops of sesame oil; it makes it taste even more authentic and closer to Chinese restaurant fried rice 😋
I'm on a keto diet, I cant eat this. I want it so bad :( maybe I could use cauliflower rice?
I have been  looking for a wok and came across your video. I can't  wait to get one now and try this out. It looks so easy and fun to do. I want to get a bunch of wok recipes together and add them to my daily menu. I know it will realy add to things.... thanks for all you do.....
Will you marry me?
Oh man its 2am and Im working with no food in the house why am I watching this!
cheers mate love ya cooking
You sound like Google translator XD
I made this last week. I didnt pay attention to what kind of soy sauce was used to marinate the chicken. I added Dark and my meat looked a little dark after it was done but it tasted really good. Thank you for this.
I like to start out by choking the chicken.
You are just adorable!   Awesome recipe too!   I should of checked this video out b4 pouring myself a bowl of cereal!!!
Needs sesame oil,
Thank you so much I made this. Super easy and very tasty
Nice treat for my girlfriend thank you 🙏
Peanut oil, not vegetable oil.  When making rice do your rinse it multiple times first?  If yes, what is your routine?  I had an aunt from Okinawa she would rinse the rice until the water ran clear.  She said it removed the starch.  I can’t remember if she used warm or cold water
BROWN RICE WOULD BE BETTER VERY LITTLE NUTRITIONAL VALUE IN WHITE RICE.
finally one real fried rice
I just found you and I just love watching your videos, the excitement in your voice makes me just want to make everything I see, I also love your step by step easy explanations to all your recipes. Also you are so adorable, I hope you keep making your videos for many many years 🌹💕thank you for your time and sharing your easy simple recipes....my first recipe that I’m going to make is your Egg Rolls served with this Fried Rice ..YUM YUM YUMMY 😋
Perfect just followed and my fiance loved it and me to. I miss some of my fav restaurants in the states so I've had to learn a lot of recipes myself because of a rural location, and this was perfect.
Looks delicious.
I like adding fish sauce and a little water to the eggs before cooking.   Water makes them fluffy.   Also oyster sauce, rice wine, and sesame seed oil to the rice.
Great!   Thanks for sharing.
She’s. nearly having an orgasm during cooking😂
Gonna try this one love you and your recipes
Did you use sesame oil?
Who else ordered Chinese food after this? Lmao
Thank you girlie.  love it ❤️🙏 💙💕😘 😍😘🙏🤞😍💞
omg. looks delish... starving now,  thanks for sharing this amazing dish
Thanks SO much for sharing this, I can't wait to try it!!!  I was wondering what the best rice to use is and how to make it?  I stink at making rice!!
Today, once again i swallowed some ants...
I just love 💗 your videos! I hit the like button before I even watch them 🥰
Hi, what kind of rice did you use pls?
I'm making this.   I love this stuff !
No mushrooms?
👍🏽
Chow fan😋
Your accent is adorable. Be my submissive waifu.
Yes it looks really good I'm going to try that
Good video...I can't go wrong
Ooooh yeah
Frozen vegetables are fresh. They are picked at their best and flash frozen. Anyway, peas and carrots in fried rice is not for me. Egg, green onion (scallion) and bean sprouts for me!!!
Love the accent❤...definitely will try this!!
I like using endive instead of the green onion.
Anybody have any cashews?
Didn’t hear what kind of onion she added
Man does  that  look good  one stupid question  when u cook  that fast does the vegetables get  soft
Looks awesome
Cooking with Mei
That is the BEST fried rice I have EVER seen!!!
In the UK Corn Starch is called Corn Flour. Thanks very much,  your food is delicious.xxx
Your fried rice looks delicious 😋 I must disagree with you slightly on one point, you’re correct about the fresh vegetables, but most vegetables we buy aren’t very fresh, so frozen both taste better and ARE better for you. If I could pick them from my garden, I’d definitely use fresh vegetables 😊
That bowl of rice is nearly bigger than you! Looks lovely👌
Looks so yummy 😋 thanks for sharing.💗
Don't forget the somss up 😁👍
Sot-= salt?
🐾♥️🐾♥️ENJOYED!
I made this without the chicken and it was so delicious!   Thank you!
I really love the orange chicken and the noodles
That looks really good
are you kidding me ? too much veggies and soy sauce.... looks are important too.
The wok looked like an upside down illusion initially lol
You guys this recipe is really better than Takeout. I make this all the time and it’s a hit every time. Even my Haitian mother has me make it for her. It’s amazing!
That look good
This looks really good. Simple ingredients and easy to follow this girls instructions.  I will try this.
Thank you lovely cooking
Oh yeah I’m gonna try to make this delicious looking recipe😋 I just hope I don’t fail. Thanks
建议米饭炒的时候加鸡蛋,这样有蛋的香味
just made me hungry
Thanks for taken time to share this I'm making this tommorow 🤩💚
Will try it if i have som leftover rice
Baking soda or baking powder?
I wonder if I could adapt it to tofu instead of chicken. Looks very good!
Why is she eating with a spoon and not chopsticks?
Thankyou so much for this video. I’ve cooked your recipe TWICE this week. DELICIOUS
"in 2020, this list helped me decide for the best electric wok *scafe.shop/tbew2020?yX* hope it helps you out too!"
Thank you for the video. I'm going to try that this week
can you do your version of chinese fried sticky rice??
Will you marry me 😍
How many cups of rice to use?
Thank you for showing this. Sooo easy
If we were neighbors, I would stay hungry.
cough cough "normally in CHINA we just use whatever left" . . . . . . . but u didnt say people are different, not all CHINESE people use whatever left .-.
I have been looking for a way to add vegetables to my diet, and this recipe is the easiest and fastest way to make DELICIOUS food that is loaded with veggies.  I chop up a lot of broccoli, I put in onion and some chopped red and green peppers - then I throw in a big handful of spinach at the end and it just melts into the dish.  I can't believe how easy and fast it is - and it is very filling and satisfying.  I'll be watching more of your videos to find more veggie-rich ideas.  Thank you for sharing!
Now I'm hungry and the whole house is still asleep 😭
Green peas not green beans
Time for me to 'WOK' quickly to the grocery store!👍👏
Are the green veggies the beans described in the recipe?  They look like peas to me.
Where were the chopsticks to scoop this?
Please marry me and cook me lots of "wegatables." So beautiful!  :)
can I use an electric stove with the wok
Now I know what i'll be making in the morning
Thank you for posting this.  I made it and it was so yummy.  Everyone ate it.
So satisfying. Love that theres no music
Just curious, you state in your video and in the recipe, "1/3 cup of green beans" I don't see where your using this?
i need to get me a wok....
hi could you tell me about goat grill chiness style thank
First you said add baking powder. Then you say baking Soda makes it juicy and smooth. Which is it?
Looks delicious!  Thank you for a great how-to video!
Thank you so much for the video ...we enjoyed it today and it is fantastic 👍👍...love it❤️❤️❤️
Great! But too much oil :(
I love me some spicy fried rice 👌🏾
Definitely trying this!
thank you for this. love you for this!

Do you have a cookbook?  Just wonderful the way you present your masterpiece 😊
Are you married? 😜
is it baking powder or baking soda?
That looks extremely good! Can’t wait to try it 👍🏽😊👍🏽
Hooooo I really love it my chines friend made it for dinner a week ago 😝😝😝
is the rise boiled first ?
will u marry me?
awesome fried rice recipe thanks
Do you have to add eggs
Love this video.seem very easy and tasty
I pressed like. Shared and subscribe. Thank you.
Unlike other videos... You made this look very simple.
Very cool video, could you tell me how did you prepare the rice before throwing it in the Wok? Do you steam it or boil it or something else? And for how long?
I subbed to you about a year ago, but was going over recipes today trying to get my chicken more flavorful in my own version of chicken fried rice which we all always eat two helpings every time it is so good.. I never went back to look at your old videos after I subscribed, but your voice is much more normal here than in your newer videos. You sound like you're trying to sound like a newby to English in your newer videos but 2 1/2 years ago, as in this video you sound like English is your first language!! Anyway I'm going to give this a try and let you all know!
oh lady.... you got me shopping for this now
Edamame...i dont know how to spell it. And more eggs...and and umm bean sprouts (goes into food coma)
Thanks, great video! Super easy
Oh yums! 😋😋
Dudes with yellow fever going bananas 😂
Thanks SUR!!!  I had watch the video a few days ago and went to the supermarket today to pick up sum of the ingredients I didn’t have @home. The rice was spectacular!!! Thanks again. 👍🏻
So much oil tho ughhhh
You culinary enchantress!!! I'm presently gnawing on my phone..wow...am sooo hungry now..can almost smell and taste that delicious food 🍳🍳🍳It is  unwise to watch this video on an empty stomach.
You’re so cute! The rice look awesome, thanks for sharing 👍🏼
Hey what’s the name and brand of the rice you mentioned?
I wrote down the recipe! Can't wait to make it!
How did you make the rice?
I made this tonight. Was really great. But since I couldn't find dark soy sauce i had to make my own. (Don't know what you use for back up if you don't have dark soy sauce) But it's wonderful
Adding soy sauce 3 or 4 times PLUS salt seasoning twice in the cooking process = a SERIOUSLY SALTY meal....definitely NOT recommended for anybody with high blood pressure or anybody who doesn't want to develop high blood pressure in the future  !!
BEAUTIFULL!
Those aren't green beans!  Those are peas.
Looks yammy.🍛
You know damn well she don’t eat this shit she look like she was forcing it down her throat 😂😂😂
Just made this today following your way and it turned out so rich and flavorful.  Omitted carrots. Added bean sprouts, mushrooms. Also did a combination of chicken and shrimp.  To the rice I added both oyster sauce and dark soy sauce.
This looks amazing yummy 👍
Looks soo flaffy
Thanks for the recipe
Gonna give this a try this weekend, might put some bacon in it. Fer some reason I'm thinkn it could be bad ace. Thanks for your assistance. 👍
u need some music
That dont even look good, rice looks too dark
Not bad.  I make better Guyanese fried rice though
I cook my eggs up with the rice. Adding about 30 to 40 sec. After I put in the rice
Please cook this for me thank you x
Definitely gets a sunbs up
wow, thanks will try this tomorrow night, great video
Nice video and good sense of humour!
Vhy you ansvers lm ouestions?

Don't you guys get sick of eating rice?
I want a vegan version
You're so charming, I love you and your recipe!!
Baking Soda, NOT baking powder! Green Peas, NOT green beans!
Jeez I suck at cooking, I almost burnt down the house
3:20 me with every good recipe lol
You said,  I don't like to use frozen vegetables, frozen ones taste better. But if you look into the research, frozen vegetables are much more healthier.
I’m making turkey fried rice. I gotta get rid of this bird! 😂. I’m excited. Recipe for tonight #thanksgiving2019
Great video..... well done....
What is the brand of knife you used? The all black. I love that!

I look forward to buying my wok (Merry Christmas to me) & begin trying all ur delicious looking meals....YUM!!! Thank you for the correction in the comments. Honestly, to make everyone happy, I'd just redo the video. You got thumb downs for one little mistake which u could have edited out. People should know by now what a great cook u are and you didn't say it intentionally. We all make mistakes and say things we didn't mean to. Continue on with your head held high & your great personality! Blessings to you. Have enjoyable holidays ahead! L :)

I just made this without the chicken because, I made Orange chicken to go with the rice...Came out really good...Thank you!
How is your little self going to eat that huge bowl?
Takeout or takeaway!?
That’s the cutes girl I’ve ever seen
so much oil...
Thanks for posting all these Chinese take out recipes! My favorite restaurant is now no further away than the wok on my stove top! 😁👍👍👍
Too dark.
I don't have corn starch is there anything I can substitute it with for the chicken?
Nice nice nice 😛😛😛😛
So glad you put both the soy sauce in the description to buy from amazon! I went to our thai store and they dont carry the light soy sauce. My wok comes tomorrow! Going make some rice today for the day old rice to make my fried rice tomorrow!
Check out my new recipe of Chinese Rice https://youtu.be/5E-GH_7tLTg
I love hearing you say " It's so Good " !!!  I can listen to you say that all day long pretty lady 😍  Great recipe , loved it !!!
Fiy some left over rise with one egg and feed your whole family..I think this recipe was evented of some poor mom who just got inventive with her leftovers to feed her kids.
Baking powder or soda?
How much rice did you use
Because you used the LORDS name in vain, I have cut your video at 0:15!   Exodus 20:7  Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.
Great...now I'm hungry at 5 in the morning.
Not as good as mine
Can you tell me, what type of oil you are using? I think the term "vegetable oil" can be interpreted widely as there are a lot of different vegetable oils
thanks, was very easy to follow and it turned out amazing
I was looking for a quick easy Rice recipe because I had leftover Rice, and It was fantastic, I used carrot, onion, mushrooms and I didn't use chicken. Tasted amazing
why so much oil? its overkill
Thx i been making that stuff for a long time and i felt like i wasn't doing something right and i sure wasn't i was cooking the egg in with everything not separate thx for the tip
Thx i been making that stuff for a long time and i felt like i wasn't doing something right and i sure wasn't i was cooking the egg in with everything not separate thx for the tip
It look so good😋😋😋
I really like your videos. They are so honest and straightforward. Thank you for your efforts. Simple and easy to follow.
What is the name of the soya sauce
Hi there, I'm a French Canadian and I needed authentic recipes from an authentic Chinese cook. Thank you for sharing your recipes! And thank you for your video on your 6 must have sauces. It really helps.
Nice job!
What type of rice?
Omg you sound just like Dara Park 😍
This was delicious, the dark soy sauce was perfect. Thanks!
Looks so delicious 👍🏻
My friends say I cook meals like a 5 star chef lol so I may see if I can do somthing with cooking.
"Oh my gawl" lol who is she, Randy Marsh?
Looks good 2 will try it thanks
Add one table spoon of korr onion soup mix to it chopped green pepper and quarter cup of red onion and it’s the best ever
Thank you so much for the recipe. That looks delicious. I can't wait to try it
Thanks for recipe it looks good
That looks disgusting.
Still hungry for just you.
She’s a baker not a cook.  A cook knows how much seasoning he puts without using measuring tools
Sooo many oil 😂😂
Now tht 👆🏾looks like chicken fried rice 😋🍚, idk what that is at the Chinese restaurant s in America 🤢🤮
Turned out fantastic! Great recipe! Even though I only had pre-cooked chicken and can of Le Sieur tender peas, also added a bit of celery. You taste ALL the ingredients individually. I subscribed for your quality.
Yum!  Will definitely be making this!  Thank you!!
Soy sauce has plenty salt in it, why the need for more salt?
Good One....From KA, INDIA.
Ok you win , im buying your wok
Looks so delicious 😋
What is the difference between the light and dark soy sauce?
Wow, this really sucks. I followed it step by step, word by word and my “chicken fried rice” is not “really goood”
Some 5-spice powder would go extra well.
Watching her beat some eggs is way better than spending a night at your place with boiz watching beer and drinking football
Where is the printed recipe?
Chicken Fried Rice  https://youtu.be/U4s9f3SFKxY
💃💃💃✌️🥬🌽🌶👍🏽😊💃💃💃💃
Looks yummy 😋 and good,okay I have all my vegetables cut up ready to start ,here I go,and thank you.
I made it and it is truly better than take out soooooooo good and I’m a kid
I can eat fried rice everyday
What about beef fried rice?
What moron would thumb you down? Certainly not me..........
Fact - if you live in the E.U frozen vegetables contain more flavour and nutrients as they are frozen at source so its better to use frozen vegetables over fresh. Especially peas.
Is it kantonis food or from north or Hong Kong
Delicious!!!
I’m not a fan of chicken fried rice but your recipe made me a real fan. This was truly better than my favorite take out place.
Your excitement is contagious! Gotta fix this tomorrow. Good video young lady. Thanks for not having an annoying intro.
I might have missed something, apologies, it seems the chicken was only cooked for a few minutes?
SO good! I was in between making this recipe or a recommended pro chefs recipe ...with 20 million ingredients... and so glad I chose this one. Super easy and quick! My son and I couldn't stop eating it 😂❤  Oh and note to self: don't use canned peas 😭😂
Nasi Tomato - https://youtu.be/QWBJSJzgZ6c
I really love all the little hints we get to make the dishes better. I thought I made a great fried rice but now it will be even better, thank you!
When she took that 1st bite why the fuck did i get the random arge to open my mouth???🤔
Delicious I also added some 5 spice to the recipe.
Hella greasy

I have made Chicken Fried Rice for years, but in trying it this way, I was really impressed. I'm making my Fried Rice from this way on! Thank you!
i had a go at making this though someone's els recipe i think it was the youtuber - Quang Tran - though did not come out right lol i also think i did to much rice lol next time i give it a try ile use this vid seems more easy to understand and you dont go as quick when doing it so easy to follow.
Just subscribed hi
Will try dis at home 🤤
I'm sorry for asking, but is two minutes enough for the chicken to be cooked, or does it finish cooking through when you toss it around with the veggies? I'm just starting out with cooking so I'm pretty clueless. Thanks.
I have to get a WOK. 🙏🤙🤙👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻💕💕💕💕💥💥💥🇵🇷
do u know how to make great fried rice using teriyaki sauce?
I JUST MADE THIS. IT WAS DELICIOUS. THANK YOU.    YOU ARE MY NEW CHEF😊
Thank you! I love this rice, will try it  .
Absalouwey delicous ehhehehehe. Looks tasty though! Great colors. Might have to try.
Lagyan mo ng shabu..lalakas kita nyo dito sa pinas..diba ganun naman negosyo nyo?peke o shabu?
Wow its yummy.new friend sis
CAN I USE EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL INSTEAD OF VEGETABLE OIL?
How are u skinny eating like that
Is that for one person ..that's alot of salt u added to whole dish
VERY GOOD DEMO,  LOVE IT,☮️❤️☀️🌈🌎😇
I just made this.  Evidently I have been doing it all wrong.  It's perfect.
Looks amazing! Can't wait to try
I just made a massive wok full of fried rice and it's amazing! I put carrots, corn, mushrooms, bacon, Chinese sausage, chicken, and cabbage in it :)  My only issue is my poor quality wok that extended the cooking time because it never got hot enough, but the results were worth the labour and wait!
Looks yummy and easy!
Wow. Just found your channel. Can't wait to try some of your recipes. I love cuisine from all over the world and am happy i can now start making some of my favorite foods at home. Keep the good food coming.
Looks similar to how my old local made it which closed years ago. You made want it again, I've never had a better Chinese takeaway since that place :(
you are such a tease  i am so hungry , i will try this out  many thanks
Really great recipes, can't wait to make your egg foo young next weekend!  Grew up eating it unfortunately it wasn't home made:).  Learned something new with adding a pinch of baking soda to keep chicken moist.  I bet your wok has been in the family for a couple generations:) What a great wok. Wish I had a gas top stove.  Thank you.
Thanks for this recipe I will try it tomorrow InshaAllah ! Just a question : this recipe is for how many people plz ? I have to cook for 8 persons  Thanks again!
I tried this today, and was a complete success - thank you it was DELICIOUS and authentic!
I like to add half a kilo of MSG to mine.
Excellent young lady thank you so much for the video you’re a gem
Awesome recipe! I substituted equal parts of Diced Sea Scallops & Sous Vide smoked Pork Belly for the chicken breast weight, it was fantastic. Your base fried rice recipe is my new go to as it is solid and anyone can switch the protein options by equal weight to the chicken amount in the recipe. Bacon wrapped sea scallops are a favorite combination of mine, so it made sense to me. Many Thanks & your Wok is awesome!!!
Yeah, i made this last night, in my toilet,
Very nice demonstation
I'm sure it's tasty but the only "healthier" part is the vegies. It still has 6 tablespoons of oil (720 calories), which is not healthy for one meal. So not good for someone watching their weight unfortunately.
chicken - diced corn starch - t spoon soy sauce - t spoon veg oil - t spoon baking soda - pinch eggs - 2 garlic minced - tbl spoon onion chopped - qtr cup peas - thrd cup carrots chopped - hlf cup salt - to taste cold boiled rice - hlf cup before cooking veg oil - 2 tbl spoon light soy - tbl spoon dark soy - 2 t spoon salt - taste black pepper - taste spring onion chopped - qtr cup
Yummy!!.. the food looks good too.
So I went to make this and only had raw rice to put in. You should mention to cook some rice first.
OmG. 👍👍👍
i no how to make that so good yes it is good 🔥🔥🔥💕💕😍
Hey there , come to my place to cook anytime.
Gr8t video keep it up
What type of rice do you use?
LOVE YOUR VIDEOS! I've been watching them all day. Plus love your accent :)
Well done 👍🏼
When you say light soy sauce and dark  Do you know the names of them ? Or some examples they all look the same to me
Awesome 👏
Love your recipes!!!🍛👍
I made this tonight OMG it's so good, Thank you :)
Thank-you; so easy a caveman could do it.
my goodness 🤤
I made this just now and it came out delicious!! Being pregnant and being able to make my cravings at home and not having to go get take out is plus! Thank you for your recipe!!
Do you use baking powder or baking soda ?
Looks fantastic!
and iv'e fell in love.
I feel hungry 😋😋😋
Sorry about the (at the time of writing this) 1300 petty negative sour pusses , I'm about to cook this, thumbs 6in advance - love your accent, thank you sweetie 多謝
Why does this recipe differ from shrimp fried rice? I noticed there is no oyster sauce
You added baking powder or baking soda to the chicken
Thanks looks great.
It looks delicious I'll try it
Omg 2 million views.
Made this tonight......amazing.  Boughta wok at the 2nd hand and i was lucky it was already cured.  Those are the best woks.  Thanks again for another wonderful recipe.  Im new to this channel but omg I am going to cook every recipe.  Amazing.  Thankss young lady!
I know what I’m cooking tonight now. Thank you
Hahaha this girl is so funny I love her
You're adorable! I want to be your friend! Let's cook. :D
I have to believe it tastes really good since you made something soo simple seem soo complex and lengthy...
Do you have one for sweet and sour chicken please
just made this ...Wow so good... i added a table spoon butter and sugar while frying the rice...my rice did stick at bit to the pan though ...i also added frozen corn!!! GREAT Recipe !! i used my cast iron skillet..i need to get a good wok!!
I like my fried rice to be lighter color. Is it okay to use less dark soy sauce and replace it with more light soy sauce? I like how you show your recipes.
Welp...no more ordering chicken fried rice for me!
This was very delicious! Made it with pork instead of chicken. The onions came out super delicious and tasted much better than I’d find at Panda Express or Chinese buffets. Definitely going to make this a regular meal in our rotation!
Baking powder or baking soda? They are two different things.
You are one if my favorite cooks. Thank u!
love watching your show here, can you cook more veggies?
I’m definitely trying this recipe!! Thank you for this video. It was great 👍
This is how they made fried rice in New York City when I was growing up back in the sixties and seventies but not anymore now they just make slop
是的..我给你了👍 因为它很漂亮
YUM! And I just bought your wok. Can’t wait!
Such a cook u r mydear 👍👌😎👏🙌love it 💖
/6
Is her accent for real?
my saliva is flowing out👍👍
Ok nice recipe but I muted.
Love your videos - any chance you can show us a dish like boneless chicken and honey sauce? It is very Australian but very delicious!!
baking soda or baking powder? lol
Sounds like mei from overwatch
what are the lines in the wok?  I am a white guy.
I tried this recipe tonight. It’s the best fried rice recipe on youtube!!!!! I love it so much, and I made it for my mom and I. She also really loved it :D We will be making this again!!!!!!! Thank you for sharing it’s so yummy!!!!!!!! 💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗
Have been really enjoying your video recipes! Signed up and rang the bell!  Plus.....you're sooo cute!!
Thank you. This is what I needed. Looks good.
Oh...so DELICIOUS!!  GREAT JOB!1
So much oil used, 1tbsp for eggs at the start, 2 tbsp for chicken/veggies, 2 tbsp for rice, that's 5 tbsp / 75 ml oil = 609 calories just for the oil part.    I usually only use 10ml of oil for 175g of rice with 100g eggs, 50g chicken, 50g veggies. 2ml for the eggs (2 or 3 pieces),  3ml for everything else chicken onions veggies, then the next 5ml for the rice. Non stick pan / teflon is better for cutting calories than a wok then. My whole fried rice is only about 600 calories.   I wonder about the stove used in here, is that a high pressure stove ?

How much rice for this recipe??
About to make this for the second time today. Cooking in a wok on a gas stove in China. Lol it turned out well the first time, even my local coworkers liked it so I was happy.
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻💖
I am an American in my 60s.  My recipes are a lot like yours.  They come from my mother who spent her younger days in New York City in the 1930s.  She used to go to the ABC restaurant at 34 Pell St. (Chinatown).  It is closed now but I was lucky enough to go there in the 1960s.
Looks good but cooking chicken for 1.2 minute 🤔 i will guarantee you the chicken won't be cooked right
She is so cute ..........I have  always love the asian culture and there food   !   Mmmm   mmmmmm   mmmmmmm   so good   !     ....      O.K  people ...... take a very good look at her wok carefully !   That is the proper and only way its suppose to look !   When its black and has a glow sheen to it !    If it doesn't look like that  ?  It means that you done a too good of a job scrubbing your wok ..... thats a  NO NO .... lol      that is a perfect cooking wok  !     She is good ... huh ?   We love you !
Oh, that looks yummy and tasty. This is how  we Indian cook the  fried rice.  But add chopped or sliced ginger and green chilly along with it.😊 Thank u dear.
Thanks for the recipe it's wonderful!!!
I love the fact that you're using a tablespoon to eat with lol
Just cooked this tonight. It’s easy, cheap and DELICIOUS!!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. 💕
I'm definitely going to make this, but I didn't know there are two different soy sauces...light AND dark! I sure hope my grocery store sells BOTH! I think the one I always get is the dark. THANKS for sharing!!
Oh my gosh my husband is cooking this right now. We make a lot of fried rice, but it's never turned out quite right. Following your instructions, we already see what we were doing wrong and now it's turning out much better. Great video!
Love this!
I am German, Dutch, and Irish...,  but I must have a little Chinese in my  DNA, because everything this woman makes causes me hunger pangs.  That is yet another Thumbs Up.
there are various kinds of fried rice.. Is your version a special local version? Eg. Shanghai Fried rice? And I see no MSG here.. The "Young Chow Fried Rice" is more white. How different is that to make with your version? I also add cooked shrimps in it and some sliced bacon.
This looks AMAZING!  My mouth was watering from the very first.  Can't wait to try it.  Thanks for this brilliant recipe.
you are absolutely too cute!!!!!!!!!!!  i have watched 8 to 10 vids and love all you do... you really are the best.. thank you!!!!
Looks good.
Looks delicious!  Can’t wait to try this recipe.
Er..………...Does the Chicken HAVE to be Chinese?
I'm new but i wont give up 💪💪💪....praying for a more subscribers....
Hey
Mmmmm that look so good 😆
Thank you! Please consider making a video about how you take care of your wok. It is amazing that it does not stick rice and eggs!
OmNomNom
I don’t eat meat and I won’t make this but I love watching her videos haha ❤️
*Step 1. Marry a Chinese girl who can cook amazing Chinese food. Step 2. That's it.* 😂👍

So sad for chicken, the way we humans eat chicken they would have gone extinct years ago if it wasn’t for chicken farms
Can't wait to make this!!
Prepare the ingredients properly, cut the respective sizes and then smash it
More like 1/4c oil...looks bomb though
😛
You're adorable and this is delicious
You are completely right about the fresh veg.
This was my first ever from scratch meal! I don't cook EVER! the most I do is out of the box meals like mac n cheese. After watching this video I got the courage to give it a shot and I can now say I've made a successful meal lol. And it was delicious! Thanks for the video.
Looks great! definitely going to try this!
The soy sauce used for marinating the chicken, what kind is it? There is mention of light soy sauce and dark soy sauce later, but it's not mentioned which kind for the chicken. Help!
That was beautiful
Love your instructional videos. Just makes me want to run into the kitchen and start cooking. Yummmm
Niceee
She sound like Asian siri
They say rice makes you gain weight how come you don’t any secret to that too?❤️
I would use spring onions instead of carrots and use cooked sliced up onion. Maybe Brussel sprouts too
Yummie. I add precooked frozen (thawed) baby shrimp & cooked steak or pork chunks. WOW! 👍😋
Wow , isnt it a little over salty??
Amazing Chanel!!! Now I’m hungry and need to find this 😭😭😭😭
All Chinese people’s accents sound like aliens from another planet
Are you kidding me. Absolutely delicious
Starving now. 😁😋
Looks tasty!
😍😍😍😍😍😍 I love it
I made this.I added sesame oil to the chicken. It came out great!
Where's the recipe for this? thanks- I hit the link below but that just shows products
You forgot Ginger !!! Ginger is very important to add to Chinese food
This looks burnt... 😖
Thank you, good presentation, will try this.
Thank you so much for this! I love the way you talk 😂 so cute...I would not use more salt though, because Soy Sauce is already very salty.
Can corn oil or avocado oil be used to substitute for vegetable oil?
I,am going to eat my android.
WOW looks and sounds good, thanks for sharing your gift of cooking freind.
I always wondered- is it true that Asian womens' hey nonnynonny goes sideways? So sorry for my ignorance. "I think I see".
will make this  tomorrow and i'll be using chopsticks to eat it, thank you.
Subscribed!!!! Loved this!
MakIng this tommorow and will be perfect as i can take the leftovers to work loool

WOW!!!!
awesome job
Good recipe. I would have liked to seen a splash of chicken broth. Seems dry.
Now I am starving
Dark soy sauce...BEWARE.. Too much = black rice.  If you like lighter colored rice, use less.  Salting after dish is plated adds flavour. That will make up for less dark soy sauce.    .
Oh yes! 💕❤️💕
Salt, pepper and soy sauce....  and no MSG  ?  Can't be real Chinese cooking then!     :-))
Which is the common soy sauce used when you call for soy sauce without specifically mention light or dark like in 0:36?
Why i can not open your AMAZON INFLUENCER PAGE now?
That looks good, thank you.
Just tried your recipe (I used chicken thigh instead), and the fried rice tastes great! My family and I love it 😍
This looks very delectable! Definetly saving this recipie for a rainy day! Thank you for sharing and for showing how to cook! 💐
„Crack 2 eggs“ Ok, I gotta head over to HowToBasic‘s channel for this step.
I made this dish yesterday for my husband and son and they loved it! Now adding this one to my repertoire! I added water chestnuts to it for an added crunch and some sesame oil towards the end, but followed instructions to the letter 😊 thank you for sharing this.
You made me so hungry
Damn, that looks good!! But it’s a lot of oil
@1:02 I always do baby, I always do.
AhSo! Plate full of shit please to no look appitizing, yeech!
@3:51 - "Spatular" ...lmao
No salt needed. Soy sauce is loaded with salt
Such CUTE English!
I tried this and now I have brown shiny color in my underwear.
Thank you so much! This is absolutely delicious!
Thanks for this video. Can you recommend a wok? Where to buy? How much to spend?  How to season it? essential utensils ?
Wow,we made your recipe and the fried rice turned out great. Best we’ve had since we moved to Florida. Thank you!
This recipe was amazing. Was so happy how it came out :D
I made this recipe yesterday, and two things. It was amazing when it was fresh Most importantly It was AMAZING still whenever I reheated it for my lunch break later in the day, and that blew me away. Thank you for sharing the recipe!!
How do they make it yellowish all the time? Turmeric?
Ohhh, its so delicious!  I would just add a little ginger. Its a great flavor. Everything you make is sooo yummy! Always makes me very hungry.
great vid, its "add salt and pepper to taste" , its "for taste" ;)
Thanks for an easy to understand recipe,but there's so much salt in it,blood pressure can rise ,just watching the video.
Looks Good!
Im pregnant and this is pure torment :))
Too much soy sauce gurl okkkkaaaaay ... cantonese fried rice looks much better
I made it! The whole family loved it!! Thanks for the wonderful recipe. Easy and delicious.
Thank you, easy to make with everything I already have in my kitchen.  Looks delicious .
This tastes SO GOOD!!!!!
wow. nearly identical to how I make mine. But the little details you add make all the difference.
Nice recipe. I also add sesame oil, abit of fish sauce and a little bit of chillie powder.
How about beef fried rice?
Nice explanation 👍
Thank you, looks delicious 😋!  What can you use of your if you don't have the dark sky sauce?
You can use any vegetable. In China we use what's left in the fridge.
You really know how to Wok and Roll, Thank you for posting!!!
Made this twice now! Great treat for the family. Thank you
So happy to have found you, amazing videos, most comprehensive instructions on YouTube, well done! Can't wait for the next vid. Thank you.
I literally just finished makeing this...Had to improvise a little but it wasnt bad..
I tried this recipe. It's awesome. Thank you.
good one!
I don’t like it, have 6 tablespoon oil is very unhealthy
Lol that looks so bomb💣
U forgot the MSG 😅
Did this bitch say baking powder
Your wok is very well seasoned! Great job!
I love her......I do not like fried rice but I am going to fix it and eat it tonight just cause I like my souped up friend.
You explained everything so well. Each aspect was so well thought out in how you explained each step. Thank you.
I've always wanted to cook this. Thanks for sharing ☺
Did you forget to put sesame oil
This is really good! I made it and it was delicious!
👍 nice
Way too much oil in the rice.
Need recipe
This is just so easy :D Will try it for sure!!! Although I only have regular / basic soy sauce in my shops.
So pretty and happy and fun!
Tried it, it was a success, amazing & quick😀 thank you, another family dish~
Can we use chicken boneless thighs??
Thank You so much! Awesome!!
Except for the peas and carrots. Love
Amazing recipe, made it tonight and it was a great hit !
What kind of rice?
I'm disapointed, no cheese?
“If you don’t know what to cook..!!” Honestly!! Always making different varieties of fried rice with leftovers when idk what to make and it never gets old so tasty and love to eat it for lunch always with extra veggies 😋😋
Peanut: No Fuck?
She sounds like Mei from Overwatch
Som saup
Yeah..its really good..but i dont use too much oil...
hungry again after eating chinese rice. ps rice is for peasants btw
I love chinese food. 💕😋looks delicious.  Thank u Jesus🙌😊
I thought she was talking about herself when she said juicy and sweet!! It was the chicken! My bad...😉
In the restaurant they add some tasy sauce that is te secret. It doesn't taste like the restaurant style.
2:46 Chop me??  🙄.After carefully listen .... Trust me.😅
The ingredients are great but it would be better cooked with rice that is not so soft and sticky. Makes a lot of difference.
Made it with a little help with my mom
Make sure to drink many water after eating this 😂
Marry me! 😍🙏🍜
Vung chung cooking.
i'm still trying to locate the black knife though
i just tried it, yummy! thank you :)
Edna mode
Ha ha  Definitely better than take out  Thanku will cook this for my 3 lil boys  This week  For sure  💓💚💓💚💓
My rice always turn out mushy
Why is there 1.1 dislikes ?
damn she blew me.. when she said “your stomach is starving” im hungry
Was the rice boiled before frying ?
SARAP PUTANG INA 😂
It looks amazing! question, where did you get that knife?
🔥🔥🔥
What type of rice did you use ?
I’m going to try cooking !! Looks so good
I love your videos!  I am learning so much. Thank you!
Iam drooling 😋😋
On point❣️I did it exactly like your recipe first time of course, delish 😋. Than I kinda twig it a lil. Depending what I had left over in the fridge and how tired I was. I added shredded rottiserie chicken or Whatever left over chicken I had. But is the chicken part I change. Ty for this! Loved it ❤️💙😊
i love exotic cuisine
Mmm hen hau che. Did I spell or say it correctly??😅😅
Loved it awesome 👍❤
I like how easy & simple ur recipes are 💕
If u cook this at college hostel kitchen, students from the mediterraneon countries or south america probably won't complain but stiudents from the english speaking nation will complain that the cooking smell like pussy while they bz mooching their canned  beans in tomato sauce or canned spagheties  meals. That was back then when food channel was a rarity to enlighten people.
Why tf you always making those weird sounds??
Looks yummy
That looks Good, delicious.
Heyy new subscriber here :)
Do you want to eat my hotdog?
Thanks for the recipe it was so good but I didn't have chicken so I used sausages... You guys should try it too! 😆
LOL I Love you a woman that can cook into my heart.😋😋😋😋😋
ok..i will try this next time,thanks!
That does look good, but really, how much salt did you put in there? Way too much for my liking.
that looks so fucking good!!!
Go eat a fucking cat
what brand or where did you buy your wok?
2 min chicken will be cooked?
i love you
First time I did this it was amazing! Second time it was disgusting !! The difference was the brand of soy sauce!
chicken - diced corn starch - t spoon soy sauce - t spoon veg oil - t spoon baking soda - pinch eggs - 2 garlic minced - tbl spoon onion chopped - qtr cup peas - thrd cup carrots chopped - hlf cup salt - to taste cold boiled rice - hlf cup before cooking veg oil - 2 tbl spoon light soy - tbl spoon dark soy - 2 t spoon salt - taste black pepper - taste spring onion chopped - qtr cup
you really know how to make someone hungry near midnight 😭
NEW SUBSCRIBER!!!
THANKS FOR THE UPLOAD!!! A LOT OF PEOPLE DONT NO HOW TO MAKE THIS RIGHT AND EGG FU YUNG!!! EXCELLENT WATCH!!!
I like how shallow that wok is and you don't have to worry about scratching it like all the non-stick pans that are out now.  The wok we had was very deep with high sides.  Where would you buy a wok like that. Seems like nothing is sticking to it also.
Can I make this chicken fried rice without chicken, can I still call it chicken fried rice? Or can I make it without rice, can I still call it chicken fried rice?
Hi... I can’t see the link to the recipe 🙈
I love Chinese food & decide to make this, so easy and very super good..
Way too long video...
Thumbs up and subscribed! Thanks for the meal ideas. I've recently got back into cooking and I'm always looking for new recipes to try out.
Hi, great video! What kind of rice did you use in the recipe?
Great enthusiasm! Looks delicious
What is it with the cuteness of the host? Had to recalibrate the cute-o-meter on my phone, it was off the roof after this video.
Can we omit the eggs
You’re fried  rice really looks yummy.i will have to make. Thank you!
add oil, get wok temperature to the same as the sun, destroy eggs add oil, get wok temperature to the same as the sun, destroy chicken   I am sick of my Chinese wife burning the fuck out of all my pots and pans because Chinese cooking requires your pan to be at the temperature of the Sun.
CHOW DOWN....!!!!!😆😍😎💓💙
I'm from NORTH CAROLINA 💯 ✔️😬.  I LOVE ALL CULTURES &  THE DISHES THEY MAKE... This looks sooo delicious. However,..cooking Oriental foods I don't care for ...TERI SAUCE...
Which type of rice do you use for chinese fried rice
I use to make this for my kids when they were growing up ... never any leftovers.
This was a cute video! Loved how during her commentary she was was drooling over her own cooking!!!
This is almost exactly how i make chicken fried rice only i use toasted sesame seed oil, gives a nicer flavour.
That looks good!
Yum yum 👍
Subbed
Those are peas not green beans
I would like to order a bowl of fried rice without the rice please. 😋
GUYS  *** baking soda no baking powder. LOL I just put baking powder : P
Thank you very much! Time to say good by to Mr. ToGo
Amazing yet simple recipe. I use a wok with high pressure burner, so this took me less than 5 mins to cook!
Simply n yummy 😋
Seriously this looks so good lol
Great video.
I made this tonight 5 June 2019 and oh my gosh its delicious. I prepped chicken last night. Cut up all the meat, veggies and cleaned the kitchen teo or three hours before cooktime so i wouldnt feel rushed and make u huge mess. It turned out so tasty. I think i used up too much rice though so it wasnt very brown but it was sooooo nice. Defintely part of my weekly rotation now. I cooked my rice and put it in the freezer for an hour to achieve day old rice. But anyway thanks for an awesome recipe
I just made this and omitted the chicken and made teriyaki chicken instead and just followed the rest of the reciepe and I also added sesame oil to the rice and it was perfect!! thanks. definately a keeper. I didnt have fresh ginger so I just added powder ginger to the sauce! 😘😘💗🌷
This looks great, pretty much how I do mine but different steps
I always thought you should add some chicken broth
good  good  video👍👍👍🤗🤗🤗
I want 😭😭😭
This really looks delicious!
This looks so good! X
Just made it! Delicious. I didnt have a big pan like that so I used a pot. And I added 1 scotch bonnet. And some sesame oil. No chicken, shrimp instead. Yum 💗
It looks delicious! 🤤
Could you please do a tteokbokki recepie? I know it's korean but I reaally want to make it and you explain things so well!
I cook mine almost the same except I also add some thinly sliced celery, and I also add sesame oil.  Love the flavor of sesame oil!
Looks good
Brilliant love it.
I use thi hom Mali fragrant AAA rice then I leave it over night then use pearl river soy sauce and a bit of msg and instead of corn starch I use potato starch the flavour difference is unreal 👌
You know what makes it even better? Kut a spring roll in there it tastes way way better! You should try it!
So glad I found this. This is like NYC fried rice. I live in California and it's not the same at all.
Thank you for sharing your recipes. You always explain it so clearly and simple and you are sooo adorable!!!
Enjoy watching your cooking videos thank you.
I just made it, came out great. I have a question though... can I make with olive oil instead of vegetable oil?
my mouth is watering
delicious! thanks
Looks good glad I already ate.🤣
Hello, I seen your recipe this morning & tried it for dinner. It was great. I added Broccoli & a lil Sesame oil to mines. Thank you for sharing!
For the new viewers who watch this,its baking SODA not baking powder
Thanks for sharing. Delicious
Initially, fried rice is an easy to make dish in the morning, from any leftover lastnight, especially the rice. Mine has different approach than this, we mainly use many spice grinded  condiment, even chili or shrimp paste condiment. Add any topping do you want, eggs, chicken, beef, lamb, seafood or even a stink bean. Bwoah, that superb and mouth-watering one.
I really loved your video.. Watching you cooking it incouraged me to do it.  I do have some left over rice and don’t  know what to do with it, so you gave me ideas how to used it ..by frying it with vegetables and soya sauce.  Thanks for sharing your recipe with us.  May God bless you.  🥀👍🏼😋
is that all for you?
I love this video, it is so positive!
Look,s amazing 👍💕🎀
I want to come eat dinner at your house yummy 😋
Probably my number one dish so I had to watch. It looks amazing 😍
It looks very good chicken fried rice.
my local doesn't put any carrots, i feel cheated! Just literally had it, thought I'd look it up how it's made. Mine also doesn't seem to use any soya sauce on the rice on mine was white as snow, but absolutely delicious!
Amazing
I would rather pay a fiver and get it from the take away restuarant and it means then I didnt cook it
What a great video!! Thanks! Can’t wait to make it, so will definitely be adding to my watchlist !
I love your cooking
Did u mean adding cornstarch? Or actual baking soda?
i think its  baking SODA folks. Just googled it. AUTHOR OF VIDEO,please edit in the correction. thankyou
baking POWDER or baking soda???
You really do need to use a seasoned wok, over a gas flame, which goes up around the wok, unlike a flat electric ring or hob, so as to get the temperature very hot. An ordinary pan will just burn everything. My late partner lived in Singapore as a child and learned to cook Asian food there and passed on some skills to me.
Using frozen vegetables is better if you parboil them for a minute or two they get plumper more tender
Lol 😆 sososo good
Is it me, or the oil content isn't fit for your daily meal.
I'm confused....which is it that you need to use baking powder or baking soda?
Your wok is seasoned to perfection.  It's absolutely stick proof!  I'll have to look to see if you posted a video in the past on seasoning.
idk why i laughed at the teaspoon of corn starch flying everywhere
Have you seen my cat?
Thanks! Looks good
Hi from Singapore
Good lord! Looks salty
I think she almost Forgot about the Egg :D Nice recipe tho.
That’s Looking Super Yummy 😋
I made this and it was really tasty, I did add some  paprika to it as well. Definately worth a try.😋
Awesome
New fan here :) I’m making this for dinner tonight 😎 thank you 😊
Looks good can't wait to try it， 谢谢你
new subscriber great video!!
Why baking soda??
Thank you for your cooking recipes i sure will give them all a try thanks again love it
What makes takeout taste so good is MSG, this is a good recipe but no way will it taste better than takeout if you do not use MSG
Ni hao..! I really like the chiken egg fried rice or chao fan....I am kinda addicted to it.😊
Marry me.
👀
Great recipe :-)
No Sesame Oil?
no sesame oil?
Anyone tried sesame seed oil ? And I don’t have a wok what’s the next best thing ?
Looks great, but I don't own a wok . And I guess u need one ?
What kind of rice did you use?
I feel bad for picky eaters. It is so embarrassing not to be able to feed your kids. My son can't seem to get him to eat he is a kid.
Turned out perfect ty
Is fried rice always made without ginger?
Having this for supper..just curious..what kind of rice do you use ? Thanks so much...looks yummy !
hippp
❤️thank you 👍
Damn girl that looks good, consider it a subscription
OMG! Yummy. My girlfriend and I just added this to top of our list. Thank you. Stomach is growling now. 👍🏻
very nice but way too much oil- could reduce it by half at least.  also,  egg will be better if you don't brown it
Wowwww...
Thank you, I thought I knew how to make this and I've been doing it wrong. Cheers!
Too much oil on rice tho. Kool video
Making me huuuuugry!!!
This looks amazing and will try it tonight for our dinner. I have tried to make fried rice many times with little satisfaction but your recipe looks oh so good!  Thank you so much!
Where is Chille
Love all your recipes. Reminds me of my mothers cooking :)
hahaha...look like to brown😅😅, may one day add alittle bell pepper for a newest recipe😉
I'll have to try this, thanks so much!
good
I like all of your recipes
I want that wok- no other will do
Great video very impressed. We're starting a restaurant in the Philippines and we're trying to do everything organic and non-GMO. My question is when cooking with oil is it possible to substitute vegetable oil for olive oil or even coconut oil. There are some health benefits to cooking with these oils. I love the recipes that you prepare and also the videos on how to tenderize meat. You definitely inspired me to create a menu for a restaurant that will be very popular to all the taste buds out there. Thank you so much
That looks amazing!
Very nice will try it tomorrow merci for sharing 👏👍🇮🇪🇫🇷🐸
Nice video, I bought a side of fried rice from Panda Express. Taste just like it.
Thank you this should be much easier for me.  Great food 🙋😍
You are very enthusiastic and your food always looks great.  xie xie ni for this fried rice recipe
Nice but. TOO MUCH OIL????!!!!!!!!!
loved your recipe! some ingredients are not easy for me to find though :( is it possible to replace corn starch with any other type of starch? and would using only ordinary kikkoman soya sauce (it’s dark soya sauce, I suppose) instead of dark and light ones affect the taste crucially or it’s totally fine?
Hi there! It looks so easy,  even I can do it! Thank you for posting! 😎👍🏻
232 you said green beans ... you meant peas *** 🤪
I'm trying this tonight thanks
Are you related to Aeri’s kitchen girl? She looks just like you when you’re tasting the food. Kinda like food porn. 😂😅🤣😆
Minus the peas and carrots, this on hit 😍
POWERFUL AMAZING THANKS YOU ⚘💯.♥️🖤💚BROWN FAMILY ALWAYS DAPHNE COTTON 💜🦋
Hi Mandy😊. I am a new subscriber, and I absolutely love your recipes and easygoing style🤗💖.  That chicken stir fried rice looks so yummy that my stomach is now growling😉. Thank You...I look forward to all your dishes. You're just so darn cute🥰💖.
That does look great! I will have to give that a try.
Just tried out this recipe,  not going to lie I thought it wouldn’t come out right and wow was I wrong! Soooo yummy so flavorful and it was my 1st time making Chinese rice and I am soooooo happy it came out DELICIOUS! Thawadah YAHAWAH for allowing me to make this meal & thanks to the cheff for showing us this great recipe. Shalawam-!
I’ve watched so many fried rice videos and this is without a doubt THE BEST. All your other videos are amazing as well. You’re doing a great job!
05/03/04 - Your cooking looks so easy and delicious. Thanks for sharing. Will be trying this very soon. You are so cute.
This looks so delicious
I love your videos , good info ,
Hey thanks you really made that look super easy
It’s so easy to to give this adorable young woman a thumbs up.I’m sure her parents are so proud of the way she turned out.
Can u do a video on Shrimp with Brocoli in a sweet brown sauce?
Yes! Always use FRESH veggies if you can! They are tastier and have better color. 🌹
Can I use oyster sauce in place of dark soy sauce?
What the hell is this monstrosity..... :#
You post the ingredients!!!  THANK YOU Xi Xi Ni KRUP KUN KRUP MUCHO GRACIAS! I subscribed!
“Oh My Gowwd”  lol 💀💀💀
Visually, it looks very brown and unappealing
yummyyyy
This is almost exactly the way my Vietnamese family makes it and it is better than take out.
Not going to lie. I have been looking for a good recipe. When I go shopping I'll pick up what I need and try it. Hope it looks like that though
I made this last night without chicken added lots of veggies. Also made it gluten free! It was amazing!
Loved the recipe! I just tried it today with chicken that I cooked before and it tasted amazing
No More Trips To Wah Lan For A While
Awful audio
Great work, simple and easy receipe thank you.
THANK YOU!!!! 🌺🌸🌹🌹
Where can I get a wok like this that can stand up to high temperatures?
I like the way she talks.
I will be making this, and I am so glad I found your channel!  I'll be making a lot more of your food.  Thanks!
I made this last night, now my family wants moreeee!!!!

i love your energy
Oh soooooo yummy
Nice teacher polite and with excellent results.      Thank you
Seriously you are amazing
I made this today! My first batch kept sticking to my pan because it was just a metal skillet but my second batch turned out pretty good! I just wish everything could have gotten a little browner. It still tasted amazing! I didn’t have any onion so I skipped that but I did add a little sesame oil. I will remake this when I get a real wok!
I truly love your videos. They are very enjoyable to watch and you make everything look so simple to do. Thanks and keep up to good work 😁
Omg! This looks so delicious! I'm making this tonight!!!! Off to check cabinets for ingredients!!
Can I make this with less oil as used in the video ? Thanks and great video
That is a pretty nice wok! 🔥
You sound a little bit like bubzbeauty
She is super cute.
Thank you this was really awesome
I will cook that tonight
I’m gonna make this all the time 😭 ugh thank you for this blessing 💕💕💕
I just cooked it and it's delicious. My 7 year old sayed that we never going to take out again. Thank you! Definitely we'll try other dishes from your channel!
What?!  No spam, chinese sausage, or vienna sausage?  It needs a salty meat in addition to the chicken! Otherwise, looks great!!
I have a question what kind of rice would you recommend in what kind of sauce were you using
I swear the best part is watching you taste the dish. Thanks for another great recipe!
Looks delicious!  Someone in my family will not eat chicken but will eat shrimp.  How would you change the recipe if I wanted to substitute shrimp chunks for the chicken?
Excellent recipe
This looks awesome! 👍🏽
RICE LOOKS DELICIOUS IM BLACK AMERICAN AND I JUST LOVE CHINESE PEOPLE...I LOVE YOUR PERSONALITY...NOW LET ME GO INTO THE KITCHEN AND MAKE SOME FRIED RICE💝💝💝
My favorite fried rice is Yang Chow fried rice. Do you have a recipe for that? Thank you.
looks awesome
What is the rice seasoning made of?
This is very good! Best I have ever made. I used some white pepper instead of black and then at the end I added a little sesame oil. Oh sooo good. The comments that your subbies left about putting freshly cooked rice in the freezer to get it ready for this if you don't have day old rice worked!
Wow . Look so delicious :) Btw i love your voice 😂
We made this tonight for dinner and it turned out great! Thank you for this video!
Omg, that thing with the baking powder really saved my life. I've also had the problem that my cicken gets so dry and blant even though i season it a lot, with this trick it's just awesome :D
What are the two types of soy sauce , she said to add at the end??
Do I use brown rice?
As if anyone has all that ingredients! Just order in less bs! Gtfoh! 😂
I'm so hungry now
Thank you so much for sharing your recipes. I kept liking and saving them but am a new subscriber 😊 I stopped buying takeout years ago. Yours is definately so much fresher and better!! 🤗
So yummy thanks for sharing
ms all looks good however u should put in a saparate plate to taste instead eating in all the cooked food plate...! dont look tempting
Glad i subscribe.. Tired of junk...food and besides i did not come to America to get Fat.....😁
Un perfecto.. First try! Thanks for giving us all this super recipe.
💖💖💖💖
New friend here! I also have a fun food chanel. Great video!😊
Love your voice!  This rice looks amaaaaazing!!!!
It's delicious! Had fun cooking it too
Why do the rice look so sticky
Your very attractive may call you sometime 😉. I'm just saying PEACE ✌️💯
Bit too much oil in my opinion but looks good
This looks so fire bruh
Better late than never! New subscriber! Tried this dish and it came out delicious! So simple and quick!! Can't wait to try out your other recipes....thank you for sharing😊👌
Mmmmmmmmmmmm
Thank you so much for sharing this. I'm making this tomorrow 🍝
Thank you for the wonderful video. I just love your enthusiasm.
Awesome
Oh YESSSsss.👀😎🏆
she's very cute😉
As a child I hated rice. Now, I love it. Taste buds are strange. Lol!
Mmmm thanks for sharing ur video…I made it and it was so goood but I added Some 🌶
Thanks for the great video - I love fried rice too, but never make it really.  I’m going to try this recipe!
You’re so adorable! I’ve been looking a good chicken fried rice recipe. Can’t wait to try it!!
Another way to make sure it doesn’t glob up is don’t cook it all the way until done.I normally cook my rice twenty minutes(my mom taught me how to cook rice).Instead cook it 15 to 16 min.
Frankly,I make my own at home.And my chicken fried rice tastes better than any that I’ve tasted out.And I know my chicken isn’t artificial ok!? Lol
I've been making my own chicken fried rice at home for a whole now, but it's still always very helpful to have different recipies to try out as well as simply having a handy reference.  Thank you for the "amazingally" good video.  Your enthusiasm also made me smile.
The only thing that I would say is wrong about this recipe is cooking the eggs twice. You will have over cooked the egg and made them rubbery. Putting the egg in near the end will mean that they are cooked just the once and the egg soaks into the rice and chicken giving it an extra creamy taste to them.
Better to add some Hoisin sauce. Or  bit of chutney, or fresh ginger slivers, a drop of vinegar to cut the grease from all the oil.
I'll have to try this with resistant starch rice
Cook steam rice that is too wet or sticky and let it totally cool off before using it for fried rice. Or else you'll have a fried rice that is soggy and all ingredients sticking together.
Delicious. Marry me.
New subscriber! Looks delicious!
Thank you.... You are making me hungry just watching.
Hi i tried this recipe. It turned out to be good.
looks great!
Look so delicious
Looks very good! Made me hungry!
I am now hungry thank you!! Lol
I made it with frozen vegetables, but it still tastes like restaurant style
Great  video, I tried it. Deeeeeee Licious >>> thank you
Incredible, thank you beautiful for taking the time to show us how to do it right, much better than takeout
Where are the bean sprouts you forgot them
Your recipe is very detailed and clearly presented. I believe your using sticky rice. Is that correct?   I like a fewest bean sprouts
One tip: those are green peas, not green beans, looks delicous! I will try your version. Thank you!
She’s adorable 👍
One of the Best cooking video ever made Congratulations ❤️
New to your videos love them your so precious you are very good at how to cook these hugs have great evening so not telling my friends I have a chef here making these dish's  for them thank you do much
Looks killer!!!!wish u was my girl!!!!
Will try to do this.will let you know how it went .
The voice is not needed. Using words better.
I like this young lady because she says it taste so good so many times she made me believe she was giving me some to eat. Lol. I just subscribed to her. If I want an Asian recipe it’s best to get it from an Asian cook. Yummy
Looks yummy.
You are spot on. I have attempted fried rices in the past with chicken and I always seem to lose the flavor in the chicken. Your tips really helped. I found the soy sauces at Whole Foods. It actually tastes better the next day. Thank you.
Awesome!
I WILL be trying this. I can’t wait!
Thank you for this recipe, I’ve been wanting to teach myself how to make fried rice!
What if you dont have soy sauce?:/
Ur black knife is cool
what kind of rice do you use?
Girl....You got it going on! I hope you have a restaurant.
I’m 70 years old and I don’t care for strong garlic tasting food, only a small amount of it, and I stay away from hot spicy food. However this meal look extremely good.
Too much oil for me! Maybe some sunflower oil would be healthier
Those are peas not beans.
too dark
I think your fried rice is not better than the take out because the rices are sticking together
can I use jus plain soy sauce?
hey what kind of wok is that? where can i get it from ?
Just found this amazing channel awesome!!!
😍
I’m late! But just made this..... it’s soooo gooddddd! But I made it with a little twist. Before frying the rice, I fried a whole bulb of minced/ diced garlic just so the oil is infused with garlic, then putting the rice in to fry. I also marinated my chicken in corn starch, dark soy sauce, oyster sauce, salt & pepper and paprika! Didn’t have any light soy sauce and baking soda.. turnt out awesome!! Also, I didn’t have overnight rice, cooked up a fresh batch and put the fresh rice in the freezer for 20 mins! Helpful trick hehe
Girrrrrl I'm bout to make this happen honey thank you for the recipe
Really good video. Explains everything perfectly.
NICE WOK 🔥🔥🔥
Nothing new there.
I think we need a lesson how to cook rice and how to get fried rice with out the wok. Its 5 of us watching this presentation together and we all realize that nobody can get a decent fried rice. We follow all advices, never got a good result.
🌸 yummy 😋  I wish I was there lol 💕💗💖✨
its called salty/soy sauce fried rice..the veges flavor are not even complemented on the recipe even the egg😒😅
i tried it once. because i cant cook raw chicken so i used nuggets.  it was amazing to try altho im sure not as good as ur cooking
i have seen and tasted a lot of different ways of cook fried rice, and i have to say the heat give a lot of difference in the final product
,
Fuck oil about 1000cc.
Awesome i will make this very soon for my family .
I made this for lunch today after watching your video this morning and it turned out fantastic! Me and my boyfriend have two full, happy tummy's now, so thank you so much.
Looks delicious! My guy loves fried rice - i will be making this soon! Thank you!
Looked Delicious am gone try this Recipe out thanks for sharing
I really wished I lived closer to this wonderful woman, I'd hire her as a personal chef a few nights out of the week.
Frozen vegetables are the most healthiest. Because they're fast freeze instantly as they come off the farm.
Yummmmmy
Way to go....yummmmm
You say you don't like frozen veges, but you use old left over rice, yuck. Once I found out you used old rice, I didn't finish watching the video.
That's not small pieces, that's large chunks, fyi, lol.
My freaking stomach stsrted growling
amazily? Had to stop right there.
I don’t have corn starch. And alternatives
kool!!! thank you for the tip about breaking up the rice with your hands, before frying!! Love fried day old fried rice!!!!
Do you boil the rice first
Looks DELICIOUS!!! 😋
You are a pleasure to learn cooking from! Cannot wait to try this💕 Thank-you!
Nice job! For everyone else you can also try dark soy sauce and oyster sauce. I use two parts oyster sauce to one Dark Soy. Just a different taste, my family asks for this all the time.
Good recipe! But why are there so many dislikes on this video??
Very simple
I'm gonna buy a wok.
I DON'T HAVE CORN STRACH AND BAKING SODA!!!  what now?
I really enjoyed watch your video!
I wish I didn't watch this 24 hours after my last meal, at 6 in the morning while nothing is open, after being awake all night. Now I'm hungry, I have no ingredients, and I'm too tired to drive to the store when it opens.... That was a mistake.
Gonna skate to coles and give it a crack, now. Multitudes of thank yous!
I know this video is almost 2 years old, but it put a smile on my face and deserves a thumbs up. THANK YOU.
Hi good afternoon I wanted to start by saying thank you for sharing just done making this recipe and almost gone 😀 Thanks have a great day 😊 !!!!!!!!!
i love your recipes! Just brilliant..But where can i get the same wok??
I recently tried this recipe and it was amazing best fried rice dish I’ve had thanks for the recipe.
Absolutely love this dish thank you, building up my Chinese ingredients to try more of your fabulous recipes, from the UK xxx
DAM! She got a BIG BOWL if IT😁🤭
Yummy😁!
Yummy.  Thanks.
I like your personality : )
How do you cook the rice to be used in this recipe?
I love this recipe!!! It is delicious and you are very good at giving directions. ☺😊🔥
I tried this recipe and my family REALLY liked it, the only problem was it wasn’t quite enough for my family of 4. I have 2 teenage boys and they eat a lot! Thanks for the great recipe!
:)
Looks delicious 😋.
Not healthy to put too much oil. Oily food can make you high blood.
U like how you put the sauces on the rice by itself before adding the other ingrediants. Id just add some white pepper but thats me. Love your recipe best!
You are so cute and sexy, besides being such a wonderful cook!
You are so cute! Looks Yum!
Souped UP thanks so much, my chicken was so tender and juicy - that never happened before!
Can u post the kind of ingredients did you used please
You did not say did you use dark meat white meat and how long to cook to cook the chicken so you don't eat it raw?
She so cute and her accent so sexy to me lol
I love you for this... Thank you
Its HAT
this is not a shameful display
Made this for my guys birthday and we were all amazed. Best fried rice I’ve made. 🥰
Im learning Mandarin and about to make this my first dish. Thank you. It looks greats!
Just tried this fried rice couple days ago, and I have to say it’s the best recipe Ever!!!!!!  Soooo yummmy 🤙
Only good for one person serving ?!
Do a simple lo mein noodle like fast food style sauce
Omygoodness!! Looks so yummy
Too much oil I'm on diet
That look good as hell!
Hi, looks delicious, but why no mention of what brand of rice or what kind of rice or how to cook the rice?
Oohhhh I’m so satisfied
2:31= is peas not green beans
Where did you get such a nice wok. I’ve never seen in so flat and I now want one. Can you tell me please?
Try adding ground ginger and rice wine vinegar to vegetables and chicken or rice
Too much oil!
Thanks
0:16 HOLY SHIT ! That’s a huge bowl of rice for a small woman....
Looks great.  I find frozen peas to be an exception.
Awww man I love you all because you made chicken fried rice haha please be my personal chef gonna make this one tonight
I always use MSG
Vegetable oil is a bad oil.
Looks nice, I'll have to give it a try. Thanks for posting. 👍

Hello I'm LAMONT what's your name
Yummmm!!!
Can't wait to try ur recipe.  Also, ur very cute!
Looks salty as fuck
No metal on metal! Use bamboo instead
Better than takeout and... FASTER.
you didn't mention MSG???? All fried rice and chow mein needs MSG to taste anything like take out
What sort of oil do you use? Cant wait to make this
What kind of rice did you use brand wise?
Can u plz tell me what's the purpose of egg?
Thank for recipe I will try today
OHHHHHHHH THAT LOOKS GOOOOOOOOD
Hello ..I so love all your videos.. I made a sweet and sour pork using your recipe last new year and it is awesome...Love you from Philippines 😊
You're adorable. Your husband is gonna get fat lol
Dang love your food so much,I'm not a novice,gona have so much fun making Chinese food like I did in the eighties thank you.
Erm. Honestly, that is not Chinese Fried Rice.  Maybe it'd American Styled Chinese Fried Rice...no offense. Anyway..there is too much oil used, and soya sauce is a no-no for fried rice. The whole thing is just too oily. There is no need to put so much oil to fried every ingredients. And i don't think i have ever eaten real Chinese fried rice with black pepper. i like black pepper too, but It's just not very Chinese Fried Ricey. I would suggest you change the chicken to "Char Siew"(chinese bbq roasted pork)in tiny cubes form or fresh shrimps instead (either one, but don't mix both together). Cheers.
I live in chinatown in San Francisco for over 10 years and we have come to love trying to make Chinese food with all the fresh produce across the street. I have been cooking with common sense mostly... sometimes it comes out right, sometimes its a bit different but it is ALWAYS tasty. I want to thank you for your channel... you have cleared up so many questions!! The elders in the nieghbor hood have tried to answer my questions but the language barrier can make it hard. I know sweet amd sour pork is not nessesarily authentic but I would love to see your take and my big question... I love lotus root but have been pretty intimidated to try using it, could you possibly shed some light on how you use it? I love it's dense texture and how it retains it's firmness. Love watching your cooking tutorials! More talk about how to tenderize meat would also make me very happy... Can't wait to try the baking soda technique! Love from SF!!💖
What type of rice was used?
What type of rice did u use?
I always use at least 2 tbsp of seasame seed oil and 1-2 tbsp of peanut or other oil for frying then add a 1/4 tsp of minced ginger and chives to tast at the end. You can substitute a tbsp of Oyster or Hoisin sauce for the soy sauce to spice it up; they contain cornstarch so wait until the end to add them. Yum! Some people add Chinese 5-spice, but I find that adds a disgusting cinnamon taste.
i hate it when i make a mistake in filming.
winner winner chicken dinner
I just want to let you know I totally love your videos and the recipes are easy to follow and absolutely DIVINE!!! 😍😍😍😍😍
Helpful
and it is cheap to make

I tried cooking this today. OMG it is the best! I have had many attempts at fried rice, but usually really claggy and too strong flavoured with soy. This recipe is just perfect! I learnt so much from this video. My toddler had 2 bowls of it for his dinner 🤣 thank you so much, I have subscribed and looking forward to seeing other delicious recipes!
This is really better than take out! I made it last night and it’s extremely good! Delicious! Thank you!

I could fill that pan up with fried rice and eat all
Looks delicious
That Chaufa, we make in Perú has not green peas, carrots, but include sprout beans, pak choy, scalions, garlic, ginger...Chinese from Canton, ooks different, and is not dark.
God that’s making me hungry

Great recipe! I tried this and the entire family loved it. Looking forward to trying more of your recipes. Thanks for the awesome video!
Looks Great with chicken
That fried rice looks soooogood. I'am going to follow your recipe all the way. Left over rice is the best I see some restaurants using yellow rice thats crazy. I have been around the world and your fried rice is the number one rice. Thanks for the recipe!!!

I just made this super delicious. I definitely need a wok for this :)
Great video thanks so much
*_Thank You Mandy!_* I like to add cooked chopped beef 🥩 and 🍤 shrimp to complete the @three flavor fried rice version of my favorite restaurant! 😇
But . . . you are so thin! You can't be eating so much regularly.
Nice dish minus the chicken and the eggs for me. Did you taste before you added the salt. Because soy sauce is very salty. Thumbs up  !
The egg is pretty dry and those are not green beans they are peas :)
All thoses dumbs down are haters. I will be making that right now. Thanks. 12/23/18 6:02pm
Too much soy sauce and salt
Looks very oily not healthy
Looks Great you should be on TV and make people smile🤤
Go to west Indian store and buy fried rice seasoning much better and add some chalots near the end
Looks soooo good.  I will try it.
STICKY
very weird girl
Made this! Tastes amazing.
sorry i wouldn't eat that because you have veg in it,,, i never eat anything with veg in it, veg yuck .  i used to make my own fried rice but now i am a lazy bastard so i go up the road to my local asian takeaway,  i always ask for double combination meats and cashew nuts,
Another great video Mandy!
I love your channel, I love your recipes 💕❤️💕✌️
I love that you're eating with a huge spoon!!
Has anyone tried this yet?
You’re the best!! Thank you for sharing 🌹
Oh! Sousi, you cook so well, you stir fried my appetite.
Is she single I'm umm... asking for a friend. 👀
Where can I get the soy sauce
I'll try tomorrow. Looks delicious
Dont forget 2 add a ton of msg amd sugar amd it will taste really good
It taze so goo so goo lovi long time
Hello. Thank you for the videos. Can you do a "how to cook white rice without a rice cooker" video? Thank you
hey you responded to my last comment regarding useing thigh instead of breast. I was touched. thank you. I'm gonna say again thighs much better than breast.  however your cooking is Awesome!!!!!
Love those lips!
What is stock soysauce? This is delicious with soy sauce and pf chang's teriyaki sauce and sesame oil. 👌
Top recipe, tried it out and have to say its bloody lovely. Thanks for sharing xxx
I am a chef myself but guys you will be shocked to know ..which ever country you go ..you will find Chinese fried rice n in each country it tastes different !!!! I like the Mexican version d most
If you add Agave with the soy sauce watch what happens. Soooo good
I think I'll add halved peanuts; peeled.
"...have a drumstick, and your brain stops tickin'...:
why you dont cook with the secret ingredient; Dont you know it?.
Any videos on diet chinese food
Trying this tomorow. Tonight I made your egg fu young. I agree with using what you have in the fridge. I did not have ground pork so I used kielbasa sausage and it tasted amazing. This will be a go to recipe in my home. Thank you, I enjoy your videos.
I made this for my family of 5. Doubled the ingredients. I was hoping to take some to work for my lunch break. All gone before I knew it! I guess I will triple the amount next time. I subscribed. Cant wait to try the beef broccoli next. Thanks for the videos. Keep them coming.
I had your Pepper steak last night, it was awesome. So tonight I will make your chicken and rice recipe which I think will be awesome too. Thanks very much for the good instructions it’s much appreciated.
Happy ending lol And I want to see next time
I found this video by accident. Tried this recipe out and  it reminded me of a chinese food restaurant I use to go to but has since closed; they had my favorite chicken fried rice! In other words, this worked out so well and I will definitely be making this again :)
That dish looks so good! Can’t wait to try your recipe !
cooked it.... daughters loved it ty
about to cook it now
Took out veggies after stir fried, then fried rice  on its on like you did.  And wow it turned out so much better.  Thanks!
Do you have beef lo mein recipe?? If not I’m looking forward for it.. thank you
no sugar ?
Love your wok! I don't like taking things out myself, I just cook cook cook until it's done.  Your Rice Fries up a lot better than mine thou with how you've done it.  Next time I might just push the veggies / chicken / egg to the side and put the rice down on the bottom of the pan, again i just don't like taking things out of the wok lol.  Great video thanks! And good tips on the chicken, ill try that next time the soda and starch.
I really like your excitement !  This rice looks really delicious! I will try to make it :) Thanks!
http://hustle.im/qxM5KVSJ also great chinese recipes here check it out!!!
looks delish
Se ve muy rico No entiendo el idioma  Pero lo boy hacer  Adivinando los ingredientes jaja  Gracias
I like to add a 1 tsp of lobster sauce with when you add soy sauces. Gives a nice flavor
I’m gonna get me some chicken fried rice tomorrow!
Your enthusiasm makes this dish more appetizing. I will try it.
I love your vids,They are quick and easy.
but when i make this it just taste like soy sauce. When i order Chinese takeaway, their fired rice has this other taste which i like better
I think the rice is a little bit dark color. I wouldn’t put soy sauce, probably just the salt and let those veggie, chicken and the wok work its job.
Yangzhou fried rice❤️
GREAT ☺VIDEOS THANKS YOU SOUPED ⚘UP RE....❤🖤💚.● BROWN FAMILY. DAPHNE COTTON 💜.
looks so nice im going to try it myself
You should try adding some oyster sauce to it!
I'm definitely going to cook this :) looks yummy
Looks good.
Just what I was looking for!!!
she is cute
Great recipe!  Tell us... Where did you get that wok?
Great video's, I'll be trying some of these. I live in an apartment, so every thing is electric. Do you recommend any electric woks, one better then another?
I am making this dish tonight with baking soda, and fresh vegetables i have to say I made it before , this is my favorite my wife 👍 it to thank you super up.
Looks yummy.
Wonderful because I'm watching my carbs I use cauliflower instead of rice.  You do a great job
I just followed this recipe and it turned out PERFECT. I used onion and green pepper instead of garlic. And I didn't have dark soy sauce but in another video I watched once they said the "secret to chinese cooking is Oyster Sauce" so I had that on hand. So I used 1 tbsp of Light Soy Sauce and 1tbsp of Oyster Sauce and it was truly better than takeout! Cheaper, tastier, and fresher. Thank you for this step-by-step video!
But if I marry a Asian woman she can make this for me and I get to skip all the steps :3
Nice recipe :)
😋😋
i think its salty
alright, alright I'll get the wok to finish my collection of cookware .
(030)
It was lovely!
Kinda missed on the corn starch 😂😂😂
I make this rice before, I will try your recipe,mom yummy  love to cook and eat,thank you from Kissimmee Florida.
Because of my diabetes I have to do as she joked and eat the stir-fry without the rice but it's still delicious!
What type of rice?
Totally going to make this. Thanks so much.
Made this for my grandsons again tonight and they absolutely loved it! Said it was way better than Panda! That is great compliment because that is their favorite place! Thanks again!
Perfect video, no background music or any silly intro. Awesome
FLOFFY!
Loved your cooking. ❤️❤️🤤🤤🤤
Looks great but not very healthy, all that oil
I tried to cook chicken like that and it was sooooo good!
I trust you. If this is a traditional Chinese recipe count me in.
I'm giving this a try for sure. I'm a huge fan of fried rice. I'm going to add shrimp and beef to it. It should be pretty good. Thank you for sharing. 🙂🙂🙂
Kon'nichiwa Mandy!!      I hope that you have had a wonderful weekend. Thank you so very much for this educational video. Your instructional methods make it appear so simple, and when you are done, it looks SOOO YUMMIE!! I will have to try this recipe as soon as i get the chance. But before I do that, I have one question for you; What is the purpose of using both light and dark soyu sauces? Why not just one or the other?? Thank you once again!!      When I was stationed in Japan, (U.S.Marines, Camp Courtney, Home of the 'Fighting Third.') I had a beautiful girlfriend, very petite, and looked a lot like you. She was very loyal and devoted to me. She lived outside of 'Uruma City,' adjacent to 'Kinbu Bay. You remind me of her. The black glasses and all. I always used to tease her; She had that Innocent secretarial look with her black horn rimmed glasses, and long jet black hair always tied up in a bun.  But when she was with me in private, her hair came down and the glasses came off..., and I better stop there!!!!      Thank you once again for the easy to follow recipe. I do hope to hear from you. Don't forget about the question. Sutekina Tsuitachi O SuperSniperSal           USMC Disabled      Vet
Hi Mandy, which rice you are using here, is it a short grain, medium grain or long grain, please also mention which brand of rice is used in your cooking for this receipe. Can you also make a video on making rice commonly used by you (regularly). Thank you- all your receipes excellent.
It looks really great, but a wok is really necessary
hate how she chops everything in big pieces .
people telling an asian how to make asian dishes..lol..MERICA...LOL!!!
Looks good Thanks for sharing!
Seriously, this was absolutely delicious.  I actually tripled the recipe to feed more people and it was perfection.  I LOVE your tip about adding the baking soda.  The chicken was tender and juicy.  Thank you so much for this video/recipe.  It will now be one of my "go to" recipes.
Its very good but your english is not
What a delight, I love your energy, video production is excellent as well.  Great job!
This rice is absolutly delishous.  Couldn't get enough of it!  Ty
marry me and cook for me every day
wow have made this twice now and It is just as good as takeaway rice and so easy to make
I made this tonight!! So good the dark soy sauce makes all the difference! Thanks great channel.
Looks delicious, I’m going to try, thanks for sharing.
Looks good and I love the passion that comes from her while she talks about the food.
What kind of rice this one.
Rice a roni method for darker day old rice
Thank you looks mouth watering i will try this tonight.
1st time seeing salt and pepper put on Fried Rice... Unusual lol. Maybe we can gets some General Tso's with a bunch of chopped parsley for shits and giggles 😜
You need a sharper knife. Also, it's a bad idea to put raw chicken on a wooden cutting board. You should use plastic instead
So far your recipe looks likE The BEST YUMMY
Can you use differant meats?
Can I skip the oyster sauce in some of your recipes due to allergy to shellfish and is there a substitute for cooking wine.
Looks good the food looks good too 😂😂
I  enjoy your videos. Can't wait to try these recipes.
Alot of salt on this fried rice
Wow lots of oil
What a creep.
This goofy bitch can fucking Cook !!!
STUNNING ( both u and the food )
BEAUTIFUL
LOVELY
I like that everything is fresh
Looks great 👍 will definitely make it sometime soon 😉 Just wondering... can I use brown rice for it ? I know it’s a bit harder in texture but it’s a lot better for  us 🤗
Looks so appetizing
It looks delicious. Can't wait to try it.
Great video, would be cool to hear it also, the sizzling...
WONDERFULL THANK U
can you use left over chicken?
Im sorry but i feel like take out fried rice is more flavor full than recipes on you tube . somethings gotta give to why that i feel as if you tubers arent telling us all the ingredients . No disrespect but thats how i feel I've tried a lot of recipes to the T and all i tasted was the same dull rice and the soy sauce.   The take out is so flavorful and addictive. I swear theres some kinda meat flavoring,stock or broth. ☺ love your videos tho.
Nicely done. Thanks for posting.
so which is it, baking soda or baking powder?
And
With the portions you have - how do you manage to stay so slim?  ;)
The end was so fake 😂
I'm on day 16 of a water-only fast.  I think I love you.
Great video.  I’m cooking this tonight but using left over roast pork instead of chicken.
thank you cutie
I like when you say " make it juicy and smooth"
I like mine with some sesame oil added to the dish. Maybe that's more american style but I like it with the flavor of the sesame oil in it.
Ilike her I think she's cute😘
That chicken is raw.
I do it in 4mins, just have to toss faster 😉
I'm very glad I have seen your video. It was very simple and I want to give your recipe a try!🖒🖒
very bland recipe - I added shaosing rice wine , hoisin sesame oil at the end to give it some life ....
Must be very salty. On top of the soy sauce you added salt TWICE
that is a really strange style of cooking fried rice. first of all, there's a lot of oil going on there and oily fried rice is not good but everyone has their own style right? It's just my honest opinion. cheers
oh then the egg!....OOOOH that looks GOOD! We almost ready!   Cute accent lol
I love Chinese foods. It's the healthiest foods in the world. I love making fried rice but the question I have for you is, what is the purpose of the eggs in the rice?
Souped Up Recipes, this is a very nice recipe and all of them look really nice. I have a question - this wok you are using to make the rice in this video - where did you get it from it looks like a really nice wok ... - please advise
China's food is miraculous..i love so much. NYC dose have some really Chinese food restaurant. No one beet those
You are so lucky to be always in great shape!: )
This was SOOOOO Easy & Very Yummy! Thank You
You mentioned light soy sauce, is this the less salt lite soy sauce I see at the market or something else entirely?
The wok you use looks amazing where did you get it from and what kind is it?
Fuk me she so sexy come to uk I love you long time me need sucky sucky
So much oil? Just call this dish fried oil.. (joking) nice dish but im kinda not a oil person so would use 1 tspoon for everything
Looks good
hey, I love your recipes!!! one question: how big in the serving size? is there enough in this recipe for 4 people?
Just got yourself a new subscriber. Great recipe and video.
I tried this recipe and it came out very good. Thank you for sharing..!!!
So much oil though.....
GOD DAM!!!!!!!

looks delicious!
when can she do a dog recipe, i like my dog stolen from a loving family taste better
Non mm
It's not strictly Chinese but i like to add a big teaspoon of sambal paste to the final mix.mmmmm
Hi nice recipe. Can you please let me know the brand name of the wok you are using. Thanks
Mo
The Chinese know how to make this. It looks good. Better than any of the others Ive looked at.
You listed green beans in your list of ingredients; however, I didn’t see them on your video.
Wow I'm on a five day water only fast and this looks so amazing.
Thank you for showing me how to make Fried Rice. I've been trying for years and just couldn't get the rice to taste "fried".  I appreciate your details and explanations of why to do things a certain way.  I've made this several times now and it has been so tasty each time.  Thanks again!  I'll check out your other recipes now that I've mastered this one.
i thot  you china ppl preferd cat
thats how u use dark soy sauce. I see
Marry me! Make me a baby! I will give you us citizenship just feed me your food!!!
Can you use plain flour instead of corn flour? By the way I've tasted the recipe you gave, very tasty but I added more black pepper and chilli flakes to give it a kick. Very good tasty recipe.
i love this,ill do the same in my channel .....
You didn't mention what texture the rice should be  after you get done boiling it.
👌👌🤗🤗🤗 looks really delicious 😋😋
Cartoon
Looks great,but the salt levels are huge-do you have an alternative to so much soy sauce?
What is the of brown sauce you added to the white rice
My stomach is sooooo hungry looking at this! Making it tonight! Thanks for sharing!
I like ur pan.
I can't wait to make this!
This dish is really nice, I made it the other day and was impressed with myself, lol. Thank you!!!! xx.
i subscribed because you rock!
Great!
Fantastic, thank you so much, looking forward to doing this on the weekend ❤️
You are so cute...Thanks for your videos
When you said "Everybody loves it there's no doubt about that" I thought - you don't know my son he is so fussy- and does not like so many meals. But he did love this after all. :-)
No sesame oil, girl?
Mandy I don't have most of those ingredients
Torture just watching this. Oooooh! I bet that tasted good!
Where are u located
Hi made it was great.  Love ur haircut
You sound so cute!
what... no MSG ??
Thanks you're a hottie 👍
Use Basmati rice. Trust me on this.
those are peas not green beans
This looks soooo yummy , delicious & healthy. New subscriber.
👍👍💚
Need to make a toy just like you that tells about your cooking. It would sell like crazy.
I appreciate you.
That wok of yours is amazing.  Pan-porn.  The food looks fantastic of course but the wok is the real star here.
but it woke away
She knows how to make fried rice 🍛 it looks juicy
wow nice vid!  btw, you should try throwing in 1 or 2 ketchup packets... it really enhances the flavor even more. Thx!
Great looking food,but that vegetable oil is nasty stuff. Use peanut oil for high heat and it's better for u.
You are AMAZING! Thanks so much.  Liked and subscribed😀
It was very good.  I give you two sums sup.
Hi, this looks so good. What brand/kind of rice did you use? Thank you
Thank you so much for this recipe! It tastes so gooooood! Xxx
Me love you longtime;)
I fry the chicken first, personally.
Damn baby girl you need come over to my crib so you can cook that Chinese Fried Rice for me and watch One Piece together!
The video was perfectly fine. The Trump/Pence bashing advertisement for Planned Parenthood ruined it for me. Don’t force me to pay my tax dollars to an evil institution that was founded on racism & hatred toward blacks-not to mention they stop the heartbeats of countless unborn children as a means of birth control.
What kind of rice is being used for fried rice?
Great recipe!
If I made that it wouldn't turn out as good as yours...
i like your vid but you need a better mic its hard to listen too
My grandson loves fried rice, would you please tell which dark and light soy sauce to buy? This looks so delicious! Are Thai soy sauces the same flavor for this dish?
Thanks!
Tried it with old rice , day old jerked chicken and no veggies cause I had none but it turned out great ! This is pretty cool for college kids like me on a budget lol.
Thankyou for the recipe, I added bac choy and frozen stir fry vegetable but I followed the rest of your recipe all the way and my family loved it so much its all gone. ❤
Oh my!   Can't wait to try!   😃
I love this recipe. Your fry pan is so nice.
one question how do you prepare the rice before
I used parboiled rice which you can fry easier
You're adorable!
I think it's so cute that she calls the peas, green beans😄
I’ve fasted for 24 hours and this looks even more bomb than I would probably think it is normally but it seems sooooo good
I believe you, I used to work with a lady who made this fresh in the deli and it was the best ever! And it sold faster then ever!
Your wok is really well seasoned.
After several trial, i got it. Thanks for sharing. I love the delicacy. Appreciated.
legit looks like my moms fried rice im so hungry nowww
please what did you add after the soy sauce? there is another sauce you added
I would’ve put a little bit of chicken broth in there.
Is this a bit westernized? May be they don't add pepper in the restaurant.  I think they add a bit water to make the rice softer.  But you style is more home style.  Thanks.
A day old Rice 😂😂😂
You are a lifesaver!!!! Just made this and my “picky as hell” family loved it! 🎉 thank you!!
You’re accent is soooo adorable. 😍
Looks lovely can’t wait to make
Hi..what brand for dark soy sauce do you use?? Thanks

I like your channel. Your presentation is very good. You seem like a sweet girl and that comes across. O??
Great video thanks for sharing
Fried rich is not good.
I guess this is not professional way but anyway thanks!
This would go great with cashew chicken or ginger beef
What kind of rice?
Just like me a monster mountain of fry rice is just right.
looks delicious will try this soon watched a video same dish by famous japanees chef guy called hito he fried eggs first and keeping in wok during whole cooking time surely that is overcooking the rice making it rubbery >?
Thank you so much loved this video I'm going cool this meal tommorow
thankyou for your video yummy #watchingFROM #New Zealand
Best recipe online! 👌👌
I made it and it was a hit!! Thank you for sharing :)
Yum looks like it tastes delicious
What is the dark liquid you add to the rice after the light soy sauce, I couldn't understand it. The dish looks delicious and I want to try it.
You are so easy to understand thanks! I am fixing to make it now, was searching YT for recipes.
ni hao
You used day old rice? (perfect. we always have leftover rice!)
You can beat me well sexy
Youre awesome, sexy, beautiful.  I love you
I learned Cantonese style...bean sprouts...ginger and garlic..no peas, no carrots...white pepper, soy, kitchen bouqet
Loved your recipe.  I make this and just added things I liked.  It turned out quite well.
I never make it past "Beat it well" :(
I love your accent and your dish. You are very cute!
soy sause  more than it's used
Thx for the recipe. I tried it tonight and it came out great. I had to make a few changes I used what I had. I didn't add any chicken, I used 1 cup of frozen season blend (which is cut up onions, bell peppers, and celery), 1 cup of frozen mixed veggies, I used garlic powder for my veggies cause I didn't have any minced garlic. I didn't have any light soy sauce, I used 3 Tbsps of dark soy sauce and my food still came out good.  I'm so glad I don't have to go to a restaurant I'm looking forward into trying more of ur recipes. I truly appreciate u sharing ur recipe. I can't wait to make it again. Thx a mill😊
Yummy glad i found your channel!!
Yum

How much rice did you use? How much green onion at the end?
Mmm looks good! Can't wait to try this put 😊
Im going to use this recipe is it possible to use yellow rice in this too just curious
Nice, very nice. I love stir fry recipes.
Omg 😲 haha 😂 QT. I love Chicken 🍗🍚🥗😋😋😋
The rice was too sticky  the clumps wouldn't break even after stir frying so not suitable for use in fried rice. Otherwise a good video it looks very yummy.
LOOKS GREAT😋
I just made this recipe and it turned out delicious. Thank you!
A-Mei-Zing!

Yummy!!!!
Y she sound like a recording?!😯
mmmm. That is the  fried rice I want to have!!
Thats a very big spoon
Mistake no problem I got the correction thank you
You are a china doll you have my mouth watering over this dish I always wondered how to do perfect chicken fried rice it's one of my favorites of Chinese food I finally found it thank you thank you !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
If you wanted to add shrimp or any other kind of meat, when would you do that and does the shrimp need to be cooked first before adding?  Thanks
Never mind, I will use the fresh vegetables instead as you recommended.  Thanks
Can you use frozen mixed vegetables instead?
I love your channel....thank you so much for this one.
OMG I need to show most people  on you tube how too cook the perfect chicken fried rice
I can listen to you talk all day. Love the accent!
Love your recipe sweet girl
Just made it. Was a hit with the family. Very easy directions. Thank You.
I have made this twice, I used fresh cooked rice on the 2nd time and liked it better. 2 questions though. The prep you did on the chicken would do that with shrimp or pork? And question 2.......are you married hehe
Now thats a. Man size Bowl!
This looks delicious! Such a simple yet tasty recipe! We love this video :)
you need music shit is too silent !!!
請問誰教妳這道炒飯的
My dad make it like you
my stomach growled while watching this!!
I am very excited to try putting the baking soda on the chicken for 30 minutes tomorrow because my chicken in my stir frys is always too dry.
Do you put the rice in the fridge over night for the day old rice?
Is that a carbon steel wok?
I need a wok like that :0
This is pretty close to the method I use for fried rice. For the chicken marinade, I would add some sesame oil, and fresh garlic and ginger, and a shot of Chinese cooking wine if I have it available.  I would cook the eggs first, Chicken second, and remove them from the wok. Then I would fry the onions by themselves, and add the rice when they are about half-way cooked.  I use frozen peas and add them near the end of cooking, then add in the Chicken and eggs to heat them. Lastly a bit of soy sauce to season. Then it is ready to serve.
This looks like it's not TOO hard to make and I should try it. A lot of oil though.
What rice did you use? Thanks for the great video
Please save some for me, I'll be right over!
You’ve got a cute voice and personality and the dish looks delicious. I will try this out. Thanks for sharing.
Can't get more authentic than this! Looks so delicious and you're so sweet!⚘
Absolutely delicious recipe, thank you so much! I'm a new subscriber, do you have a recipe for fried egg rolls?
I love that wok !!  where did you get it?  Fried rice looks delicious!  Can not wait to try.  Thanks for sharing!
Just tried it out :) was delicious! https://imgur.com/a/XkmJG Added Broccoli and water chestnuts since I had some left.
good thank you, I love it
can't wait to try it
I love how she said 30 minutes. It was so cute
You're very cute. Thanks for the recipe!
Did you put baking powder or soda on your chicken you said baking powder when you put it in and then you said sold it keeps it from getting dry… Which is it?
太好了
I gave thumbs up love to learn make quick food!!
What kind of rice did you use for the stir fry ? Also can't you just mix the twp soy sauces together and then pour over rice...?
Where are your chop sticks? Spoons are for soup.
rice maker makes perfect rice every time plus like she said leave it in the fridge or the next day it comes out better
I love ur accent ❤️
Thank you so much for sharing this I have been wanting to learn how to make all sorts of Chinese recipe for so long I am going to try this and hope fully I can send you a video of how I learned from you.....  Thank You...
Great Video And Great Food! Thank You!!!!!
I use my kitchen scissors to cut up a lot of things in the kitchen, including the chicken.
fucking ROCK N ROLL!
I love your video and recipes. Keep up the good work.
so yummy
Cooked this recipe last night for my family and it was excellent.  We all loved it . I do recommend
Yum yum!!!
Wonderful better than mama 😍😍😍😍😍
I am going to make this asap
so delicious 😋
Am a foreigner studying in china i love their fried rice , i want to try it on my own is it possible to add a little sugar to this recipe
Thanks for sharing! I made it today and it tastes and looks just as good as yours. Also you were right, fresh veggies was really worth the effort! 👌
Tried this it was yummy but u kept saying green beans while you used peas in the video.
You made this look so simple! I am definitely going to make this!
I use the Uncle Ben's rice in a bag cooking for 10 minutes comes out perfect then take it out of the bag put it on a plate and then add to any Chinese recipe.
"its really good, good....god" seriously?!
surprised you did not use sesame oil
If she didn't over exaggerate so much, I would've given her a thumbs up 😧
💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕😊🙌
Looks very good
Just made 😝 it's amazing thanks for the recipe ✌️
Hello, New subscriber here. Really enjoying your channel very much. Thank you for sharing your gift for cooking. I wanted to ask you where I might find a black knife like the one you    are using in this video? And what material is it made from that is black?  Thank you again and hope to hear back from you soon. Bless you
Looks good. I will definitely try this.
Which type of rice do you use.
Marry me.
it looks salty as hell,adding salt to soy sauce is not recommended :D
I love salt but I'd never add salt to this dish the soy is salty so it would just end up being to salty
Are those green peas? Anyone?
I want to keep you in my pocket you are ADORABLE.
thats ALOT of oil.
I made this a few days ago and it’s better than takeout!  My daughter loved it
Thanks for sharing. Your illustration is so simple and straightforward. I prepared this at home and it came so good.. I just subscribed to your channel and i hope to get more recipes
I want a wok!
Lol she so silly but I definitely will try, she made it look too easy.!
Where can I buy a wok like yours?
Can you use olive oil instead?
Shouldn’t you like wash the chicken before cooking?
I tasted my first fried rice when sent to Thailand on my second tour of military duty, while in Bangkok, and since then I loved it so much until I kept making it myself. I have my own wok which I purchased years ago from the local air base, and have used it many times. That dish you cooked look great and I will be trying doing it that way.
I like the food , but I mainly watch the videos to see the the chef, super cute accent and beautiful lady.
Tried this for the first time and holy moly came out so good everyone loved it
Wow
Oh my engrish
Nice video.. I will be trying it.this weekend
i saved your recepi
mmmm delicious!!
WTF??? The point there is egg and chicken in fried rice is because they need to fuse it with the rice, so when you taste the rice, you can literally taste the chicken and egg as well man.   But look what you have done! You put aside the egg and chicken while frying the rice?  Omg..  You shouldn’t call it fried rice but soysauce rice with egg and chicken instead.   You really called that dish a fried rice? why dont you just stir the ingridient in off-heat like salad? It’ll blend as well.
Whow!
Oh my go'. Ahh sooo.
OMG!😄 YUMMY!!! JUST TRIED YOUR RECIPE, AND I HAVE TO SAY MY FAMILY ATE IT ALL UP, NO LEFT OVERS! Thank you sooo much for your recipes and time. You truly are a wonderful teacher looking forward to watching more videos and trying them out.🍽🤗😋MMMM
so oily
Good recipe...but I like white pepper instead.
your cooking make me very hungry.i have to try some of that
looks great can't wait to try your recipe!
That was a wonderful​ put together recipe. I loved how you explained it all. Thank you so much and yes it's so delicious. Happy Holidays.
delicious
I must definitely try this recipe. I have one question though: Are the veggies pre boiled?
that looks so delicious I can't wait to try it
Wow this looks so bland where's the flavour ?
That little person can't possibly eat all that chicken fried rice ! No way lol
Ese arroz Chino quedo' Perfect!!. Pero no creo que los chinos coman arroz Chino,ellos hacen ese Plato para El publico Americano.
I subscribed and clicked the bell because you're so adorable
Very similar to my mother's fried rice!
Don't you ever stop making your videos. My family loves these recipes. I am a professional chef to my wife. It is a blessing to see her light up when I make a beautiful dish. How are you so skinny? These recipes are awesome!!
She said “baking powder” but meant “baking soda “
Soy sauce has a lot salt doesn’t it. Is there a better sauce to use
You are a dream come true!! I love fried rice so much
Tried this and it is amazing👍🏼❤️
And now I have a crush....
@ :41 you said 'add baking powder' then said 'adding baking powder will...' . Well, which is it? ARe you adding baking powder or baking soda?
Thank you young lady for the receipe. It looks quite good.
Funny to see someone so thin scarfing down big spoonfulls of food. I absolutely love Asian cuisine. This recipe is so easy and good!
China woman is drooling on her own.
That looks good. And to all those who say Chinese food that is shiny and glistening and looks oh, so bad for you, is not "real" Chinese food, I say "I don't care."
Made this rice and WOW   see ya later take out  LOL This was the BEST ! Thank you so much.
👍🏾 Gurl get a room sounds like it’s giving you a orgasm 😂
Thank you for the recipe. I’ve seen different people’s recipes for fried rice, but yours looks the most delicious of all. When I make fried rice, I will use your recipe. I also subscribed to your channel and look forward to more of your recipes.
Watching this recipe again to prepare myself to make tonight's dinner! I'm using red pepper, peas and mushroom tonight because that's what's in the fridge 😃   Your method is truly the best!
thank you for teaching me how to cook this!
YOU ARE VERY CUTE
I wish I could take a picture for its turned out absolutely delicious 😁😁😁😁😁😁
high blood pressure here i come
Ministry of silly woks
almost swallowed my phone, i got a text when i gulped lol
Iam so hungry after watching your video thanks.           great video
Can you recommend a good non-stick wok? Is yours cast iron?
Helpful tip here: if you can't use day old rice, cook up a fresh batch then set it in freezer for 15-20mins. This gets rid of some moisture in rice, so rice doesn't stick together and become a glob when reuse in fried rice recipe
My wife makes good fried rice.
Thanks for sharing... We can try it with Kohinoor Basmati rice too.. it's tastes super.
I also don’t like frozen vegetables in my fried rice. I add plenty of green onions and sometimes some thinly sliced cabbage.
Thts alot of oil for this yummy dish
U r soo skinny 😳not good.ur recipe is good
This was lovely I actually put some of your chilli oil on it and it took it to a new height thank for this. Can I ask do you know how to make the curry sauce that Chinese restaurants use or do you have a recipe for Chinese curry chicken thank in advance
I  l o v e  y o u
You are aDORable, Mandy.
This sounds so good...will definitely try soon.  thanks Mandy.
Hi! What rice did you use?
What about cooking rice than frying instead?
Mmmmmmm delicious !!! ... are you married???
it looks really good. i will try this.
Thanks hungry now
What kind of soy sauce you used it?
can I used flour instead of cornstarch?
😊
Damn that looks good
What type of rice is that? ? Brand please...looks so yummy
amazing...pretty much how I make it.  I use a little of the Kung Pao with the soy sauce to marinade the chicken breast just to give it a little kick .
Thanks for the recipe!! My family likes it!! I substitute chicken with nuggets 😂
How many servings
What kind of vegetable oil do you use? Peanut oil? Sunflower? other? Also - are your carrots and green beans (peas?)  precooked or raw? Thank you.
I had always thought Sake needed to go in with eggs or rice when frying this.
How much calories r in it
Thank you Ms. I have tried to make this many times and had no real success. I'll give this one a shot! Cheers
I made this last night and it was Wonderful!Family said it is the best fried rice ever! That means a lot!! You are a great teacher and thank you so much for the detailed recipes!!
You have good arms. That must help when you're doing all that stir-fry stuff. You make cooking fun.
看起来很好吃😋你是哪里人？
Looks good.  I'll try that this week
What can you use as a replacement for light soy sauce?
Can you make a video for generals fryer chicken
hmmm
Can you do a video on hot and sour soup?
With that much soy sauce you shouldn't need salt.  Looks great!
my mouth watered
who else thought they were looking at the bottom of the pan good vid though
Thank you for sharing the recipe. I’m going to try it.
I will try tomorrow
I have friends in Los Angeles who own a small Chinese restaurant; Hui was giving me a crash course in wok cooking stir fried rice. The wok was over a very high BTU well in the stove top and he started adding vegetables, meat, seafood and seasonings to the well oiled wok. Wisps of smoke came off of the sides of the wok and flavored the rice with a special nuanced smoke flavor ,hard to do at home. Hui said that was the breath of the dragon, I loved that.
That was such a good tutorial. Will you do a review on your favorite style woks and seasoning them?
that is some disturbing amount of oil haha but looks good tho
The rice seems over cooked...otherwise, it looks great!
me so horny,i will love her long time!
Delighted to have watch yours , exactly the taste I was looking for . I add chilli into it . Was very pleased with the outcome . Tasted like Singapore fried rice . Thank you .
this is making me so hungry
That looks really good
Your chicken fried rice looks great I have to try how you did it.
If you’re single I’d love to marry you because I like cooking also
I think you meant to say, "Green Peas" not "Green Beans." Looks yummy.
I just made this and im eating it now. DELICIOUS!!!
looks good but way way too much oil.
I love everything about these videos!  The recipes are not too hard and she’s so cute
Mmmmm i love beef chicken and pork as well as shrimp fried rice love it o yea
with this recipe I can open a restaurant thank you for the lesson
So yummy
I'm actually going to make that meal tonight it looks so good I've been thinking about it every since I watch the video LOL
It's excellent. I drop the egg from the recipe, but the rest is great. I like the baking soda tip too, good to know that.
Super sexy
Omg, mouth watering, great video I always wanted to know how to make that.
Looks completely beautiful, and the food is good too.
tyvm
Wedgetables
No chicken for me and no eggs for me. I assume I could do this with the fried tofu I can buy at the Asian market?
That chicken is dead because you wanted to eat it. Farewell chicken!
No ginger added?
This for once really does look better than take out - Nice job! What a beautiful wok by the way!
Already falling in love with you. Clear English, easy steps and pretty lady. Thanks for sharing
Bit to salty for my tastes. Less soy sauce for sure if you don't like it being super salty.
Delicious
Thank you!♡
I love cross country dishes and have seen lots of dishes I must say you are the best,just made my rice for tomorrow,this recipe is a must try for my family.thanks soo much.
What kind of rice can be used ? Regular white Rice or Jasmine Rice ??
Can you make pouw
I made chicken fried rice for dinner tonight- Everybody loved it! Two extra thumbs up from my son and my wife!  greetings from germany  j.
I love how easy you made this authentic meal look.  I look forward to trying it at home. Love your accent too!!!
Thx quick n easy thx I just added ginger yum
+ Souped up Recepies could you make a  beef chopsuie recepie please and thank you
I love your channel!!! Your recipes are great & easy to follow!!
Love your videos as always you explain everything it does looks delicious I would love to make it one question what type of rice to you use and if rice has been washed before cooking thanks looking forward to you next video
How would you change this with NO egg and substitute pork instead of chicken! Does this recipe change that much? Any more substitute for veg oil?
👍🏾
What kind rice is used?
Very cute and looks good dish to make
I love the way you explain it makes me believe that I can do it also 🍜🍛🍲🍳
I love how you make your videos.  Calm.... Simple.... No music... No drama. . Love your explaining things . Great video.
Lovely
I need to get myself a Asian wife.
I really enjoy watching your cooking lessons!! PS-Your hair is so beautiful!!
I tend to use peanut oil instead of vegetable oil is it ok or do I have to use the vegetable oil?
Made this for lunch yesterday, and it was super. Thanks for Sharing
hahaha so cute this girl
Thanks for the wonderful fried rice recipe...have a good day
Yummy😊 New to your channel☺ TFS👍
Yum yum yum 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
OK,  now I'm ready ta get married  ,(now),!!!  you looken for a husband
It looks yummy !!! Well done Darling👏🏽🌺
Ok the flavor is great , but, my rice was so mushy I ruined my dish. What did I do wrong?..
can you make shrimp rolls and egg rolls please?
I want your wok. Everything sticks in my still :( and I seasoned and reseasoned it
Sweetheart, you are absolutely gorgeous but with your fried rice, you forgot a couple of things.  What about some ham cut into large cubes.  By large I meant , long, mushrooms, about a dozen school shrimp for that much rice, and fried rice, is not fried rice without watercress and bean shoots.  Otherwise, job well done.  Will you please marry me?
Thanks friend, am making it NOW!
Thanks for the video! Your accent is adorable.
I think any stir fried rice and noodles can only be accomplished at a restaurant. Not enough wok hei.
I would use a healthier oil, vegetable oil is not a good one.
I LOVE THIS! I've been making chicken fried rice for ages and my family always liked it - but once I made it your way they said I have to do it that way from now on - no going back to the old way. SO glad I found your channel - can't wait to try your other recipes - also love your presentation and how easy it is to make correctly - Subscribed and a fan. : >
Yummy Yummy yum yum!
Thank you for showing how to cook yes baking soda is the right thing to use.
Recepie for dog with hot sauce and rice?
Mine came out great! Family loved it, thanks so much for sharing this wonderful recipe.  By the way I used thighs.  #nomorecarryout
Looking forward to making this today🙄 thks.
No msg?
I just cooked it and girl, this is one of the best Chinese fried rice I've ever eat. I always add bittersweet sauce to fried rice, but this one is perfect without the sauce. Thank you for sharing it!
thank you. Sweetie. my 2 girls love this dish  😇👍🙋‍♀️🙋‍♀️❤
Your not a classic Asian. They use chopsticks to eat you use a spoon. Disappointment
Great video. I will try this. Thanks!
I add a pinch of Chinese 5 spice  Just a pinch so it doesn't over whelm the rice
I was wondering what's a good wok to buy that will last and not rust but won't break the bank?Thank you
The only mistake is not saying which of two is used.
This is world class food porn. How does she stay so skinny tho'?
I made this today and seriously better than takeout. Can't wait to cook again. Family art it all up.
Look like too much soy sauce.
This is good
When I'm making the rice, do I cook the rice or let it soak in water?
Please put ads on your channel - nobody is annoyed by them and it's only fair you'd be compensated for all your efforts!
Do you really need to add salt with all the soy sauce?
looks delicious
Nice job! Looks delicious- I am going to try it. Thanks!
Hi,this is my wife's favorite.My new Woks get used every day.Our friends are honest when they comment on my cooking and they say that this is the best. I try to send them home with a little bowl if there is any left which is rare.They say it's as good or better than any take out.My wife and I think it's the best food that I have cooked,ever.I don't know what I enjoy more,cooking,eating or watching my friends eating and enjoying such delicious Chinese food.thanks again!
How do you stay so thin eating all these delicious recipes? Do you throw up after?🤤
that huge spoon tho! get it, girl! 😄
l love the simplicity of this recipe, only thing, do not like the obviousness of the egg chunks showing...l rather for the eggs to be coated and hidden in the rice.
Over cooked egg already. Sheeesh
Definitely trying this one day with bits of salted fish thanks!
This sounds so good. I am going to make it this weekend for my boyfriend 😊
I made this for my husband and it was a hit! Please do shrimp with lobster sauce it's what I always order at a restaurant.
Is the light soy sauce a fish sauce?
Can you please tell me what the is the difference between the lite soy sauce  n dark soy sauce
I just made this and it's wonderful!
Looks great. Can't wait to try it. So I need is some light and dark soy sauce and baking soda. Cool.

Looks so good!
For those who are wheat intolerant, you can substitute soy sauce for Tamara sauce.
Your recipes are awesome.  Keep up the good work.  Thanks!
try adding a little bit of toasted sesame oil just before taking it out of the wok -- adds a super nice flavor -- just a little bit adds a lot of taste
What's the difference between dark soy sauce and just normal soy sauce? Will the result be different? Be fix I want to make this but I don't have dark soy sauce :/
So Yummy! You are a  sweet and funny person. Your green bowl is pretty. I'm all in.
I have subcribed. I am LOVING your recipes!!!
Very similar to how I do it, but lacks the controversial MSG.  I also tend to use some oyster sauce and chili oil to add some sweetness and heat to it.  I think she it's hits the keys about browning and giving it a little burn, plus getting the oil smoking.  That is a must to achieving the signature fried rice flavor.  I have loads of Asian cookbooks but it was YouTube channels that helped me get the results I was after.  I still buy my shrimp rolls from a local takeout place though mainly because they taste great, it's quicker in cheaper than doing it myself.
I love your videos! Thank you so much :) <3
Me love you long time as well as your recipes .
Do we have to boil the rice before frying?
Nooo .. don't eat without me 😅
Please please please do GUO TIE potstickers and the dipping sauce ! =D
Hello. I tried your recipe two days ago and I was really satisfied of the outcome. However I was wondering, the soy sauce you use for the chicken marinade is different from dark soy sauce and the light soy sauce you used for the rice? I just had one soy sauce for all, I couldn't distinguish at the supermarket the light from dark. Is sugar soy sauce the one you refer to as "light" ?
What brand of soy sauce is best for this? I'm total newbie, thanks!
loved your vid
Awesome Job as always.  Do you have a video on making white rice
i wanted to snatch that entire damn bowl out of her hand when she took that first bite.My taste buds are going crazy like i want it and i want it nowww!
I'm hungry watching you cooking, lol. If i'm not mistaken you're Chao Zhou from Canton, right?  Very good channel, will check your Patreon...
I love your videos! You make it sound so easy and fun! And.. they're delicious! I"m learning how to cook bc Chinese dishes bc of you!!! Luv it!!!
You are so charming:-)
I got a full blown erection learning how to make this
I'm not saying that this is wrong, It's your way of doing it. But I like my fried rice without all those bits of lumpy rice, still a good video.
I also think you make your recipes easy to follow I definitely plan to follow some of my favorites ...cheers!!!! I love how you explain everything!!!
Could you show more street food please
Girl how you so skinny LOL i love how you enjoy the food you make so much
Look delicious and I will Make this dishes very soon!! 😋
love your videos,keep them coming they are so easy to do ,Thankyou for sharing your talents with us all
Hey, everyone, thanks for watching.  I want to correct a mistake in the video. At 0:43 I said baking powder At 0:51 I said baking soda That was a mistake, I am so sorry. Please understand baking soda and baking powder are not the same thing, for this recipe, you need baking soda no baking powder. Hope you enjoy=)
It's 2AM and I've watched 5 of your videos already :((((((((( they look so amazing!
Baking Powder is not the same as Baking Soda.
Nice easy and tasty dish,  I made it with sliced steak.  in the video you talk about adding baking powder then baking soda to chicken,  which one is it please?  thanks for the resipes
Delicious! Thanks for sharing.
haha she says spatula like mr. krabs
Do not add salt because the soy sauce has too much already.
You are so sweet love your videos
Mushrooms
looks a treat! must try👍👍👍
Well done Mandy,we love Asian food and your recipes and camera work are good,thanks and keep up the good work
u convinced me!  I'm drooling already!
you used a lot of oil
Which type of rice do you use??
i love your recipes 'keep making more; excellent
Love your videos. Can I request that we "hear" the sizzles from the pan?  Something about hearing the hot oil sizzle with the veggies enhances the site of each of your videos. Thanks.
Good job.
looks yummy
I think I'm in love . are you single ?💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝
Another thumbs up to my asian sister! (but where is the background sizzling work sound)
Did u use jasmine rice??
I love the way you cook & Nice presentation
Peas not Beans lol
hello miss i did it with turky meat it was delicious
I seriously need to make these, you really seem to enjoy what you do! Definitely a huge plus 😁
I made this and it was so good. I made your pork belly recipe too and it was also really good. Keep making these and thank you :-)
dark meat is always better. :D
Mandy, another excellent video with great production quality. This is definitely something I can try soon, just gotta pick up some more chicken. Thanks for putting out these videos.
Glad i found your channel, please do more... would like to try all your recipes!!!
Loved your recipe. Gotta try this out. I like adding grated ginger too. Thx for The video, greetings from Brazil.!
This looks amazing! Did it take a while to cook your carrots to desired doneness? What texture should I look for?
Eh. Normally I'm ok to watch your vids but this cooking fried rice is wrong. The rice is pretty much soya rice and over salty. 1 table spoon of dark soya sauce is enough. Egg is stir fried with the rice thrown in same time. Hmm guess this is different way to cooking fried rice.
Looks delicious! I would add some green onions and a little of white pepper!
thank you for sharing the recipe
i made several of your recipes :) I will make this one too :) Please show us how to make salt and pepper squid.  Also it would be great to show us the brand of stuff you use like soy sauce, rose wine, chinese cooking wine, black vinegar etc so that we can find it in the grocery store :) Thank you and cant wait to watch more videos :)
yay!
Great content. Keep it up!
Excellent video
I have seen a tablespoon (or 2) of water added added to eggs to fluff up the volume.  Perhaps only when making something more omelet like?
Very good! If you need any free music for your content, come browse through the playlist's i have, i think they would really imrpove your stuff!
Thank you. It looks really good. I will be making it soon.
Great content. Keep it up!
