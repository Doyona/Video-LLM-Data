What's your favorite use for GARLIC???
Dumb questions: does the pesto have a strong garlic taste and, do you compost the stems and roots from the garlic?
Do you sell those then?
What's the use of the white strips, on top of the garlic in the bin?
So say it's early spring and you want garlic this fall...any way to plant it since I missed the fall window?
Mr Farm, have you tried making black garlic?
Serendipitous ? Bon Appetite posted this not long ago https://youtu.be/XLVxVQ8O0s4 (Fermented) Garlic Honey
Do you prep the soil or fertilize the bulbs?
What would be the difference with related plants, such as onions or shallots?
Any insight on where you got those great bins? Both the red ones and the black ones look super handy for harvesting tomatoes and other crops.
how come you don't leave them in longer till the seeds form on top of plant and use that to seed next years crop? ... by doing that then you could save all the bottoms for yourself ... (im not an expert on garlic, just asking cuz i know if the tops are left on long enough you will get a bunch of mini-cloves  as seed)
Does anyone use the scapes?  I've never tried them.
Wow, finally got around to editing that footage huh? Is this the hoop house that you showed us how to put up with some trickery?
