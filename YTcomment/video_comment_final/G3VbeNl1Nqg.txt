Hello there! If I use natural colour so can I do the same mixing colour powder with rubbing alcohol so I get the beautiful colour in my soaps?  Thank you

Thank you for yor videos. It's very useful but i have a question can i add any organic oil like almond oil to melting saop? Or i have to add it from the base?
How much vanilla color stabilizer to fragrance ( for example for 1 oz fragrance how much vanilla color stabilizer?)
hi. I have seen extraordinary bars of lavender soap that were NOT brown or green. Did the person making the soap use another process? I do not want to gift brown lavender soap bars! Please help, ASAP!
WHAT is the difference between clear soap base and white soap base?  and thank you for the information the result looks great!
Hi! I'm wondering, in cold process soap, can I use herbal tea instead of distile water? like linden tea or camomile tea or any herbs infused water? Does lye make tea bad? thank you! :)
Thank you for the video...is there a preservative that you can add to the soap to keep the flowers their natural colour?
Hello! I've lots of questions... Will fresh fruit extract spoil the melt and pour soap? Also, what is the usual shelf life of a melt and pour with dried herbs on it? Lastly, what are natural preservatives that can be used to extend an M&P soap recipe... Thank you! =)
Hi there - I've started the soap making a couple of weeks ago, and now I can't even sleep, all I'm doing is thinking and dreaming of it loooool. Thanks a million for your videos, they are very helpful and informative. I have a question please (and don't laugh at me) can i use a broken eyeshadow or blusher?
Hi! Can you use powdered milk to glycerin melt & pour soap base? I'm outside US and its really difficult to find goat's milk melt and pour soap base. Thanks!
do you have to dilute mica powders in rubbing alchohol?
can I use turmeric in melt and pour soap? If I can gow much should I use?
I cant find rubbning alcohol anywere in my country, is it possible to use perfume?
Hi! I plan to add fruit powders to the soaps. Should I mix it in water or in glycerin before adding to the soap? TIA :)
so can i use food colouring??
Hi, do you use the same alcohol mixing technique for mica and pigment as you used for oxides? Or do you use glycerine?
Is there anything to stop that? The brown ?
Do any of these colorants stain skin? They are beautiful but it'd be a little funny to have purple skin from the soaps.
how do you color your designs like the flowers soap ?
At what temperature of soap base should herbs and flowers and herbal powders be added? Thanks :))
hi, by adding herbs, doesn't the life of soap decreases to like 6 months? also, what if i use the soaps after the expiry of the herbs used in them? should we add any preservative to such soaps?
More alcohol-oxide questions please.  Is there a formula for how much isopropyl alcohol to mix with the little measure of oxide?  Looked like it might be about 1/2 tablespoon?  Can this be done with ultramarines, too?  Thank you.
so could i use an fragrance oil and mica without it changing the color of the mica?
question, when you use the alcohol for diluting your oxides, is it just regular rubbing alcohol, 70% , 99%?
Hi, I don't see episodes 3-5 here.  This is my first time learning about soap, and I don't want to skip or miss anything.  Is there someplace where I can find those videos?
After you make melt and pour soap, do you set it aside and let it cure? If so for how long? How long to wait before wrapping the soap and what kind of material do you use to package or wrap it in?
I just came across your videos . I love them and you're so pleasant to listen to. I have a question about colorants, I'm new to soap making. If I want to follow one of your reciepes , and if it calls for a certain colorant, say a lab color , do I have to use a lab color or can I use a different colorant in place of it and would I then have to adjust the amount? Thank you Dawn
Hye ' what is ur best video without using a lye?
Hi!   You did mention you can use food coloring... Can you really? Will it stain your hands? Thanks!
I have a bunch of honey soaps that I want to rebach because I hate the color. I am more into pastels, pinks, light blues, gray. What color do you suggest ? at least to get anything different to yellow, orange, green or brown?
I am new to soap making and I got some mica oxide color. I tried mixing the oxide with rubbing alcohol, then in olive oil with a different batch. Neither worked very well and I'm getting a grainy consistency and the coloring gets everywhere and stains. If I don't get the color mixed in well enough, will it stain the skin when someone uses the soap? Thanks!
can you use non bleeding as your only colorants?
Hi, I'm kinda new to this soap-makin'-thing. But when you use like green food color your hand turn all green? Or is it a such a small amount?  Great videos!
Hi Does Germaben help with the browning of the petals or flower buds in the m&p soap?
if you use dried lavender flowers will it still turn brown?
Once i dilute 10ml of the lab color into 8 oz of water, how much would i put into my soap? When putting this into a lye calc would i ass this as water or??? Im so confused, thanks so much!
What about color blocks?
Thank you so much for your wonderful videos! I am just getting started with melt & pour and I'm a graphic artist. I really want to make my own soap molds with my own designs. Do you have any advice about how to do that?
Is it okay to use fresh herbs in soaps or will they get moldy? I understand that the herbs will turn brown, but since I'm making the soap just for myself I don't care much about the coloring.
Are there any other herbs you would recommend besides Calendula Petals that will not turn brown?
Which colorant is the easiest to use? Thanks :o)
If you use food colour in soap, will it stain your hands after use?? Thank you!            Toodlepip !!
You sell non-bleeding oxides which are oxides mixed with glycerin, but in the video you're showing how to dissolve them in alcohol.  Which do you think is better for dispersing the color? Would both methods produce a non-bleeding color?  For the micas at the BB site, it would be really nice if you could create 2 sub-categories--one for the natural micas and one for the FD&C colored-mica.  It would make locating the natural colors *much* easier.   Thanks again. :)
So does that mean the soap will eventually start to go rancid/decompose?  Can you preserve the color (and soap) longer by shrink-wrapping it?  Thank you. :)
can you used dried herbs?
Question about the herb: so is there a way to prevent herbs from going bad in the soap?
hello :))) I was wondering if I could use food coloring on a shampoo bar? I mean, would the color come off? sorry for the silly question, but I would really like to know :))))
I made some soap with the Cellini Red Mica from brambleberry, and my soap started bleeding!!! I didn't use a lot, so the ending color turned out to be a pastel orange...why did this color migration occur???
Hi, I have oxide and liquid Glycerine, how can I dissolve the oxide, how much glycerine can I use in oxide/ ultramarine? Thanks!
can I use food coloring?
@soapqueentv does that mean you can add glycerin to food coloring to make sure it doesn't bleed? It's just that I'm only 14 and on a budget so I don't really want to go and spend heaps on money on expensive colouring when I also have to buy all the other ingredients.
So can i use lab colour in say  a bath bomb? I  want to start making my own and one of my favorite things about bath bombs is how they lightly tint  the water fun colours
Hi I'm a new subbie. I'm just waiting for my moulds then I'll start experimenting with my mp soap. I was wondering can you add melted natural butters to mp soap to moisturise? Also can you add powders like clay and charcoal as colourants and detoxifying properties? Thanks! x
Hello, Anne-Marie! Thank you for sharing your soapy knowledge and information with the world! I'm very thankful for that as I'm a visual learner and brand spanking new at soapmaking. Just a few quick questions: It is ok to mix DRIED herbs (lavender, rose petals, etc) into the MP soap? Also, I would like to mix powdered milk/honey (or liquid?) to MP soaps. I have been advised that it will cut the lather depending on the amount of powder mixed with melted MP soaps? Please advice.  THANK YOU! :o)
I have a question....if I am using non bleeding colors should I use UV inhibitor if the soaps are going to be displayed in a window?????thanks
Hi i live in the uk and have got hooked on your video's they are great!! i use mica powders in papercrafting so when i have a go at making soap can i use these to add colour?
If I use dried lavender or rose petals, will it turn brown?
MAC has bright, loose pigments--can those be used to color your soap products?
Can you use any of these colorants in like Hard lotion/ Salve or ever cream lotion??? Please someone let me know, it would be awesome if i could!!
So why should we use lab colours if they mix badly? How about if i dont have any non-bleeding colours, i only have food colours and i want to do many layers of them? What should i do and is there any solutions???
Do you have to use alcohol to make the mixing easier?
Is there a way to prevent white soaps to turn into a "pastel" color when we color it? I hate how sometimes, I want a color to look vivid; but it looks so creamy instead. BTW< awesome video.
can u use food flavoring????
I've noticed that there are lavender buds in some soaps too but Im assuming that they don't brown after a week? Are there any types of lavender that I could put in the soap that wouldn't go bad? I'm kind of want to do a lavender and oatmeal soap -- think it would stand?
I've made many soaps now over the last month & actually have friends buying some from me! (I've given most as gifts but some are special ordering ones.) But what I'm wondering is would I have to get involved w/the FDA at all at this point? I've been looking around on google & have a Soap Making for Dummies & they are saying that since this is something that goes on skin, you have to list EVERY single ingredient. So not just Shea Butter but ALL the ingredients in it. Is this true? Anyone know
quick question would you mix the micas with alcohol like the oxides to incorporate into the soap?
if the colors(oxcides, etc) can be used in eye shadow, how come they don't transfer onto the skin when using the soap or do they?
I have a question, is there anything that can be done for the herbs to have a longer life in the soap? and will the same happen in CP soap?
