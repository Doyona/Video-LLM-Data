Sir, How long to grow up artichokes, from begining until harvest?  How to get the tubers of them I want to plants in indonesia Thank you for your respond 🙏
Thanks for the info. I'd like to ask you since sunchoke has a few eyes if I divide them and plant, each one of the eyes will generate a new plant? I ask that because I want to propagate them very quick because here in Brazil it's too difficult to find them.
How do u choose which tubers from last season to plant?
I live in northern Minnesota. Can I plant the tubers this fall and harvest next fall?
Thanks for the video. I’m planting for the first time this year. Can you tell me when I should expect to see them shooting and what the young shoots look like? It’s now mid May and I’ve seen nothing yet. Many thanks.
Was a great video, but what does a sunchoke plant look like?
Just out of curiosity, what dialect is that?
how do they taste like? similar to potatoes, rutabaga, or sweet potato?
Hello i live in Washington State, when would i plant and harvest here? Thank you, enjoyed your video. Sincerely Rick.
