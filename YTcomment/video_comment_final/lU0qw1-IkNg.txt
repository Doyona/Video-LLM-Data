What's the name of the tape you used?
Car Addict Garage, never mind the last question i ask you about the 3M i you have 2 sizes shown in the video. One thing i want to ask you what sizes should i go with a 10M or a 15M? I'm trying to tape up a windshield moulding on my 03 tiburon, the lip on that moulding is thin and hard, what size 3M tape should i go with?
Car Addict Garage, can i ask you whats the part# and description name of this 3M tape product so i can go to my local auto paint supply store and order one?
couldnt see alot of it as there was massive subtitles in the way???
Oh WOW nice! How long should you wait before removing the masking tape from a spray Job?
