Sadly I’m not having a good outcome with custards and I feel I’m very meticulous about following directions. My custards either come out scrambled, even though I temper the eggs to the cream, and then I had one batch come out of oven with quite a bit of water underneath the top layer of custard. Could it be an issue that I use a counter top oven? (Cuisinart) I know not to use the convection mode, just bake.maybe these don’t have accurate temp setting like a large oven? Anyway, would love some trouble shooting from you...thanks!!
