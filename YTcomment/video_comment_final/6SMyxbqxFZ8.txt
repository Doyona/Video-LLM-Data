Hello, these looks fantastic. I was wondering can they be premade and frozen? If so, how long can they be frozen till?  Thanks for sharing!
Is that an 8 or 10 inch pan
How much flour gig u add to the crapes? You say 5eggs butter milk and say spoon in the flour but never say how much of it you move right on to the ricotta cheese and so on.
Do you have a recipe for waffles  😟
Thank you tatyana for this delicious recipe I'm gonna try to make this for my family but is crepes is Russian or French??
Hi Tatyana, . Greetings from Australia!  Aren't nalesniki usually filled with fruit as well as the cheese mix? Some nice tart cherries would counter the sweetness of the cheese and sugar. When you take them out of the oven add some more fruit and/or juice, along with some smetana mixed with mascarpone.
What temperature did you heat your oven?
