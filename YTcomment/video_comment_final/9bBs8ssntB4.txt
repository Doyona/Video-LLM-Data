Nice gatefold sleeve but there's still a chance the record may slip out from the side. Can it be stored inside the 13"x13" sleeve (or anything bigger)?
With these sleeves, can you store the vinyl outside of the album cover?
Anyone in the U.K. bought the archive gatefolds? What did you think and how much import tax did you get hit for?
Do you have triple gatefold sleeves. I have several albums that are the triple gatefold albums.
Love em!  How much?
can you demo the mylar 4mm sleeves. Thanks
