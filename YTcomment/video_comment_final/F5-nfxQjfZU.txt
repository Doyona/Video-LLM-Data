Chives??? Shouldn’t you use scallions instead of chives...

Is it real pad Thai? It has so less oil.
I am really enjoying learning how to cook without pounds of meat to create a dish. I was like,”3 oz meat? 3 oz shrimp!??” Learning how to let meat be a co-star, not the focus. Thanks:)
I can't find preserved turnips anywhere. Is there any other sort of substitute I could use? Is it necessary to make pad thai?
What is a Newter?
Hey fellow cooks.  So I'm following this recipe directly but the tamarind I have is nothing like as thick... It's actually runny (TRS brand, tall thin blue bottle, red cap,400g) Since I'm not yet able to figure out what the sauce should taste like uncooked could you possibly tell me how much of the runny tamarind makes up the concentrated paste she uses?
Loved it. My toddler is addicted to the music at the end that goes laa laa la la. Can you pls tell me the name of that track?

Any substitute for tamarind?
I just did it and am eating it while typing. It is really good but at the asian store I went they gave me preserved turnip instead of radish. Do you know if I'm actually far from your recipe in term of taste?? Its actually pretty good and I tasted the preserved turnip before adding it and I kind of really like its taste.
I'm from a small town in Brasil, I'm afraid I won't be able to find the tamarind, even on online stores... I know it won't be the same without it, but is there any thing that I can use to substitute it? To at least get the same consistency or amount of sauce?

What brand of tamarind paste and palm sugar do you buy? The ones at my asian grocery stores have tamarind concentrate that is more liquid and light in color. Also the palm sugar is usually hard and solid not sticky like yours. Do you do something to the palm sugar first?! Thanks to anyone with info!
What is that awful smell in pad thai in restaurants? I reheated one and there was a stinky smell. It was not going bad...maybe some additive or the fish sauce.

From someone who has had a fair few pad thai in Thailand this looks like one of the tastiest?
I’m so excited to try this! But I’m having trouble finding the sweet radish. Is it ok to leave it out or will it really take away from the flavor of the dish?
Is pad thai supposed to smell 'bad'? I've had it and sometimes it just smells of peanuts and spices and other times it smells (not to offend) like a kennel/wet dog. lol I know it's probably the fermented sauce but is that smell normal? can it be cooked off?
