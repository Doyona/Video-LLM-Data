I’m getting a scraping sound as the fan turns. I’ve tightened all bolts. Any ideas?
I install it but when i turn on fan my fan is shacking during work how to stop shaking it?
Any help after install? Fan was working great for about a week and now make very loud humming and whooping sound. It I hold the light kit part with my hand it stops the noise.
I have an extra green wire from the ceiling. Any ideas ? Or just leave it with a nut wire
Installed this fan and the grey wire is not connected to anything and the fan doesn’t spin but can hear the motor! Know where this only grey wire connects to?
Does it come with a remote control?
