Hello. I want to try it, but I was wondering is in it a bit crunchy taste because of the sugar or it’s stays completely smooth?
For the past five years, no matter if I buy Domino powdered sugar, or a store brand, it makes my frosting taste like soap.  I looked online, and so many others have this issue.  Do you have a suggestion on a brand of powdered sugar that does not taste soapy?
