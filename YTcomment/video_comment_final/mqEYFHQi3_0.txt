What year was on the label ? It seems newer than 1972.
$400? It's about $3,500 now.
The pump having an integrated check valve, does there need to be another check valve at the expansion tank?
Hello there folks. Anyone know how we can find our well which is hidden under ice and snow at our new home in the North of Sweden? The pump has died and we know roughly where the well is, tried an iron rod to probe the snow to try and hear/feel a change but this area has so many rock that we keep on digging only to find a huge rock. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks

So when water leaks into the 230V motor, why aren't you electrocuted in the shower? Is there any fault current flowing?
Do you feel you have a "big hose" that needs clamping with your "big hose clamps"?
Any chance you remember the rpm on that pump? Those backwards curved impellers require very high rpm to move their intended liquid or vapour.
Would it be possible to generate electricity simply by flipping the deep well pump upside down
how much did you pay to change a pump? labor and pump?
Which part is damaged first?
How do they pump water in space?
How much was the replacement with labor...did u have to replace the pipe? Thanks!
Is there way to check the pump before goes all together .   I am On a well like to know when to change the pump .   Hate to it just stop working .  No water at all would be a big problem .  lol
Where are you from
Thanks for the tutorial!!! I do have a question,if the pump is incased in a stainless steel cover,why is it rusted?
little bit like Archimedes screw huh?
How Does A Deep Well Pump Work?  It works well, thanks.
What was the part number on the TO-220 mosfet looking thing? Could have just been a BT### series triac from the way it is wired. The bimetallic strip heats up, disconnects, and that disconnect only happens at a few miliamps, leaving the heavy duty beefy switching to the silicon. That way your heat sensor contacts will not wear out ever. Edit: I was almost right, it was only for the start winding.
Can a 1kva stabilizer be used to bust the voltage for 0.75hp  pump?
Does the pump pump water into a pressure tank?
Don't you hate it when small parts fly out at you?!  lol
Infinite ohms??  I am no electrician, but doesn't that just mean a closed circuit or "continuity"?
is it just me or does no part of that reflect 70's tech. not sure a mosfet would have been utilized in that era pump as well as the multi stage abs impeller pump.  i've been wrong before but something just doesn't add up here.
so... why is that worth $400?
How do well pumps not get clogged so far under ground?
So the whole unit is submerged under water?
A bit too quick to cut up the pump part. Are you really sure it's actually as old as you claim? Some parts did look a bit more modern than that. I'm not sure when the TO-220 packaging of electronic components appeared, maybe it was as early as '74 and then this must be one of the early applications for that. Notice that most electronic components have a date stamp on them consisting of year and week.
What brand pump was that?
How can you determ if it was hit by Lightning or not.?
Really cool stuff. What made the biac switch just pop out?
