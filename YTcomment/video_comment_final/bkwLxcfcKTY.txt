Why do you do syrup with the sugar instead of adding the sugar straight away?
Hi Nick, can you please let me know where to buy the peach essence? Or the brand. Thank you
How do you get the shell to rise
How do I swap almond flour for flour?
Help please!!! I have oil based food colour, can I use it for macarons???
I have seen the recipe on his website and it says it makes enough for 30...does anyone know if that means 30 shells or 30 complete macaron sandwiched cookies?
This may be a strange question, but how come you have to put a syrup into the meringue when you make macarons?
This is the first time I tried this macarons method, any body know why my macarons skin is all wrinkled after baked? I did left the shell dried to touch , and the feet has developed during baking. it’s just having wrinkled skin :(
This is a nice recipe but can you also make this without using the Italian method? Will it make a difference? I am not really into the hot syrup stuff. lol
Your next question can be about your recipes..,like when is the macaron perfectly done? Or like how many recipes of mine have you baked?
You should ask what did everyone what to be when they where younger!? I generally wanted to be a MERMAID! with lots of GLITTER!
Hi Nick, I have a question  I'm a beginner on this and I saw few videos how to make macarons and I saw you doing the syrup with the sugar granulated and mixed with the meringue and I saw other persons mixing the granulated sugar straight  with the meringue what form is better or correct or both are?

Does leaving the whipped egg whites alone for about an hour cause it to deflate faster? Mine deflated too fast before I even finished mixing it through so mine was too thin n didn't rise
Would using organic food coloring change the outcome of the macarons?
I don’t have any question ideas you can ask but I’m wondering, what do you do with all of the leftover food you make?  P.S. I don’t know if you’ve said it before but I’m curious lol😊
why not use cheaper ingredients then so people can see what might happen.
HOW DO YOU TAKE SUCH AMAZING PICTURES OF YOUR TREATS OMG
What do you do when it's raining and you can't see anything because fog is coming in from the north, and you can't hear your mother calling you for dinner because you're on top of a hill twenty miles east because you had to look for some magical berries that only grow in high and dry places, and you need the berries for your sciatica because it's getting out of hand, but you fall down the hill as you start heading home because the hill is slippery, and all of the berries are gone because the old witch lady from down the road stole them for a potion that she's making to turn everyone into frogs so she can take over the tri-state area?

Question idea: What was your funniest/worst holiday baking story?  I tried making macarons but never got anything to turn out like yours. The recipe I used was very different from your recipe though. I may have to try again because I'd love to try to do one of your recipes. They look wonderful!
How about asking what everyone's favorite holiday dessert is and making a macaroon out of the most popular one.
Can you make blueberry flavored macarons?
You should ask "what flavor macarons next?" and challenge yourself to create a hybrid version of the two voted most popular! ;)
Do u eat all the macaroons after each video ?

Hey Nick! I have a question for you.  What is your favourite shirt to wear? The stripy one or the other stripy one? 😂 💕
You’re question should be, why tho? 🤔
Random Question: Do you sell your cupcakes/macarons after baking? In South Africa Almond Flour and Eggs are extremely expensive, so it costs a pretty penny to experiment with baking. BUT i must say, i used your macaron technique and it worked out first time :) so i'm really grateful for all your macaron videos. Much appreciated.
What’s your favorite weird flavor combo?
how many macroon shells does this batch make? :)
Your question should be if you could have any super power, what would it be?         Mine would be to be able to eat whatever I want without any consequences. ;u;
What’s the biggest fear you have as a baker? And why?  Why does almond flour have to be so expensive?!?! 😩  Also can you make different Macarons? Like with coconut flour for those who are allergic to nuts. And other nut flours? Like cashew or pistachio flour?

What is your craziest fear for the next question maybe?
The technic used to do meringue can be used to do Macarons too? Sorry If it's a repeat question - ( watch and re-watch all of your macarons videos and hopefully one day I'll get to do it... I live in Haiti and let me tell you other than the eggs everything else cost so much that I could feed my family of 6 for a week so there's my hesitation 😂)
This should be the question for next week- what is your fave scran line video?!!!
