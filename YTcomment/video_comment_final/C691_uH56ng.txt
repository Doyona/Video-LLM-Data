Do honey Roasted pecans work too? Instead of raw ones...
Has anyone tried to make this as a single cake rather than individual tartlets? I am wondering how it would turn out. I mean it would likely change the thaw times, but would it flop when it is thawed enough to slice?
Where did you buy the lemon squeezer?! I can't see the link in the description :( Thanks :)
Looks SO incredibly good!! Going to make it some this weekend! Where do you find the mini pie plate holder thingys? (I'm Canadian too). What a great Fall recipe! Thanks!
Looks delicious, what did you put on top? Coconut whipped cream?
