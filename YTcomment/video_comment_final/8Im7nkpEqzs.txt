What's in the filling? You just showed it already prepared stirring the ingredients then adding the butter.
How many calories is this?
are there any substitutions for the butter or is it essential? I try to use my butter sparingly in my baking because it's a little expensive where I live. Thank you to anyone who answers🙂
Would that work with molasses or something like that ?!

Can you use coconut oil instead of butter? Or is butter essential to this? I just have a milk allergy, so I'm just curious if i can substitute it here.
I'm drooling😆but what can i replace the almond flour with?
would it be good without sugar?
Will this work with green apples? I think the sourness of the green apples will add another level of flavor.
