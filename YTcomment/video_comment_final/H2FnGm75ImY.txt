What size is the apple pie mould/ dish?
How many people could you serve with your apple pie? Valerie 😊
Hi John. Could freeze the apple after you add the spices, for a later date? Valerie
I’ve a question. I do not have a food processor but do have a held hand mixer; can I use to make the pastry?
What is the size of the pie dish? Thanks
Hi John great channel,  do you do any recipes for airfryer as well ?I´d love to make a chicken pie crust pie using an airfryer is it posssible , cheers Paul from Austria
Thankyou for taking the time to share this recipe. I am going to have a go myself with no baking experience. For the pastry can you substitute the granulated sugar for the same brown sugar you are using? And also for the topping? Thankyou
John, this looks incredible. I can’t wait to try it. My Nan made the best apple pie when I was a child, I only wish I had been old enough to think to ask for the recipe before she passed away. I will definitely be trying this tomorrow. Thank you. 🙏🏻  If I wanted to try making Jam tarts (you know the little individual jam/lemon curd ones), would this be a good pastry for that? I guess they’d need less baking time. Would I need to blind bake those? I can’t get them here and I miss them dearly. Another taste from my childhood. Finally (sorry for the inundation in questions) I’ll make the pastry by hand. Do I add the sugar before rubbing in the butter or after? Many, many thanks for everything. ❤
what is the size of the baking tray?
hi John, nothing to do with cooking, but there's a narrow boat documentary on ch.4 and the narrator sounds exactly like you. Is it you using a different name?
One little general question from a fan of your videos.   What is the actual advantage of doing it with cold butter and a mixer compared to room temperature butter, very gently with the fingers (not with a mixer), without forming gluten of course?  Thank you John for your fantastic videos.
Could you use cooking apples instead of Braeburn apples?
Hi sir, for the cornstarch mixture can I heat it on stovetop instead of using the microwave?
Looks lovely, I love apple tarts. What is the difference between a pie and a tart. Pastry?
Winnie the Pooh?
do braeburn cook softer than granny smiths or bramley john ?? i,ve only used those last two types 😉  great video again .
I love pies and making pies. And EVERY bottom crust is always soggy. I've tried every trick and hint I can find on the web.   Any advice for that problem?
Thanks for the video John. If I wanted to freeze this recipe at what stage would you suggest I do it?  My rolling pin with the spacers on is brilliant used it today to make your mince beef and onion pie.
Hi John, if I want to do a peach pie instead of apple, how should I prep the peach? Anything I need to do differently than apples?
Do you have any recipes that call for honey, lots and lots of delicious honey? We all love hearing your voice. Cooking with poo bear 🤗
Is there anything John can't make? What a guy. Hooked on this channel. 🙌🏻
Won't this have an uncooked bottom because it wasn't blind baked?
Hi John. Can the sauce be thickened on the hob rather than in a microwave? Thank you for the recipe. 👍🏻
Do you ever add a pear to “smooth” out the apples.
Winnie the Pooh? Is that you 😱
John, I've made several of your recipes, THANK YOU! However, i seem to be having issues with fruit pies coming out runny. What am i doing wrong? I followed your recipe and video exactly (using gala apples) and once again, the insides are quite soupy.
Hi  John, if I want to use a 11" pie dish, how would I adjust the recipe? Thanks
Hi John!  Where can I find the apple pie follow up video for the homemade custard please? Thank you John
Hi John, I only use whole wheat flour in all my baking, can I substitute whole wheat flour one to one for all purpose flour? Thanks.
Thanks for this recipe John. Can you say how much sugar to add for a sweet shortcrust pastry please for a batch made with 340g of flour? Thank you for the videos, they are really inspiring. X
Hi John ❣️ I've just put the apple pie to cook in the oven. As I'm cleaning up, I'd like to know what to do with the leftover pastry? Wouldn't want to let it go to waste 😉
Hi there John, can I ask where you purchased your pie tin from please? Thanks
Approximately how thick do you roll out the pastry?
Hi John. Love your videos... especially your bread recipes. I've never had one fail, so thanks for that!  In your pastry recipe can I substitute lard for the butter?  Is there anything else I need to consider if I swap it out?  Thanks
looks very nice, but could it be so sweet??
Hi John. Can you let me know the exactly the brand food processor your using in this video please?. Would like to order one.
It looks wonderful! Do you ever have a problem with a soggy bottom? ☺️
John,  What material is your black pie dish made of?  You got me fired up to do some baking.
what temperature do you set the oven at ? Thanks so much
John will the juice flow out of the fork holes in the bottom? Your techniques are so helpful. This will be my next John Kirkwood recipe I’m going to try. You haven’t let me down yet!
This pie has no calories... right?  Haha.  Gorgeous pie John.  The custard looks delicious.  Ice cream is a perfect substitute as well.
Dear John, thank you so much for another great recipe! Is the pie as good the next day as on the day it's made? I want to prepare it beforehand and treat our guests on Saturday, but not sure how it will survive. Thanks!
Uh, where's the Ala moded John? (Vanillia Ice cream) 😉
Lovely apple pie.  Is this the traditional British apple pie?
