aren't you supposed to pigtail the grounds and attach it to the switch?
So where is the power source coming from?
Whut happened to the ground?
Is the wiring the same if my power source to my light switch is a 3 prong extension cord? This is for a lighted mirror that will stay plugged in but will turn on/off with a switch. Thanks in advance.
why wasn't there a grounding pigtail and ground added to the switch.
why wasn't ground wire connected to light switch?
question..i have five lights in a row that need to be hooked up 6 ft apart...do I daisy chain them?
can do wiring by 2.0mm romex for runner for the lights and for the switch ??
And what if power is coming from the light ?
how come you didnt connect the ground wire?
Nice video. Can you tell me what to do if you are wiring 3 switches instead of one (3 switch box) and power coming in from elsewhere like your video shows? Do you connect 1st switch as described in video then use black jumper wire from switch 1 to switch 2 and 3 respectively? All commons and grounds together? Hope the question is clear. Thanks
