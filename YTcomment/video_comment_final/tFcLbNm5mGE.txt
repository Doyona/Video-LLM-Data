What temperature should you cook it to for the kind to use in a wax warmer?
Do you use squeezed lemons? 😫And does it matter if it’s the yellow ones or green. I wanna try to do this but with hearing it needs or you used a thermometer is me doubting to do it especially bc I don’t think I have one
Has anyone tried it with brown sugar? If so, is it supposed to take longer to get to the right texture?
How do you prevent the cold sugar from melting while trying to use it?
When do you start to stir?
how do you use it for your face, i can't even use it for my legs 😭😭😭😭
@abetweene   Might be a silly question but what are these containers? You mentioned that you microwave to warm the wax so they must be microwavable? Can you please link them?🤍
Which is the best to use with strips? I did the middle one and I hurt myself because it was too sticky and barely ripping the hair out.
My sugar gets hard if I kneed it and if I set it out for an hour you can’t even take it out because it’s hard like a rock. What am I doing wrong??help me
Thank you for your videos! You're a great teacher. Feels like a silly question, but can you pour the 240+F sugar mixture directly from the sauce pan into a plastic container for storage? Or should you let your sugar mixture cool a bit first? I'd be inclined to get the mixture off of/out of heat ASAP to stop the cooking process, but does the plastic survive contact with something so hot? Thanks for your insight!!
Why is mine watery ? 😢
Hi, Can we reheat it in a wax warmer that heats up to 70 C ? I heard sugar wax should be heated to about 50 so wondering if there'd be any issues/inconvenience caused if heated at 70
can I use this on my coochie? Im trying to reduce landfill waste when it comes to caring for my cooter.
Would it work just as good of I just bought caramels? I only want the sugar wax for my face...
Hi Ariane 👋. i wanted to ask about the ingredients; Can you swap out lemon juice for lime juice? i am severely allergic to lemon juice and want to know if it is possible and what changes would be expected in the result. Thanks for this video, very informative 😊
Hello! How long can the wax be kept? and how will you know that it can no longer be use?  I put it on the fridge after using it (i always make a large batch) then just microwave it. My wax usually last for 6 months before its totally gone.
why does it become hard when I do neading 😢?
This is late as heck but with middle firmness sugar wax do I need strips?
So the first time I did it it was really stringy. The second time it was hard as a rock before it even cooler. Two questions: the stringy batch can it be recooked and used and second question: what can I do to use the hard as a rock batch? Also don't use a plastic spatula, mine melted in second batch. Can you pour it onto foil? Thanks for the informative videos!😊
My sugar keeps over bubbling how do I stop that? Lol I keep having to remove it from the stove
Hi, Adriane! Did you order the plastic containers on Amazon? They have the perfect size!
The wax i made is medium high temperature colour and i put them in freezer but it's not kneeding and when I put them on my hairs it's like liquid... 😩 Is it undercooked??
Question for how long can the sugar last in the container? and should it notbe stored in the fridge?
Can i use a smaller batch like 1/2 cup sugad and 1/4th cup lemon and water?
Why doesn’t my sugar stick together (I got it out of the store) I can’t rip it off in one swoop like you did actually I can’t rip it off at all with my hand
If you have your sugar in a plastic container how do you warm it up without using a microwave? Wax plate or wax pot warmer? I feel like the plastic container will melt
why is my wax hard and all over the place in the cup it’s not as neat as in here ??? also the wax was at room temp after the wax got cold (room temp) from leaving it in my room for a little bit
Okay, I think I undercooked mine, could I just boil it again? I used cane sugar so it got darker a little faster I think? But it’s still runny like.
Can I put this in the refrigerator?. Mines is clumping but its not getting to the opaque color
I always get red bumps after sugaring my neck (pcos). I moisturize with jojoba oil after. What can I do to prevent this?
What to do with undercooked patch? Can i save it or i need to do a new patch?
Hey there! Where did you get the containers from?
How to not let lots of bubbles come in your wax after you put it into a container.
5:26 does anybody know how much the temperature for this consistency????
Too much talking and too many option's. I'm confused not trying to be mean. Can you make a simple video for just the sugar wax that you use with a strip pls???
Hii !! Just a couple questions ! How long do you wait before pouring it into those plastic containers? I bought some of those microwavable plastic containers to make a few batches in bulk. Also what temp can I set my wax pot to to heat them up?  Thanks sooo much in advance !! <3
Can you please tell me why my solution is getting hard like a candy when it is getting cold , when it's hot it's liquid , but I can't apply that much hot thing in face , kindly help
What do you do if you over cook ?
Hi, i have cook the sugar to 240F for a soft ball but the color is white and liquidy. What did i do wrong?
Should we need to apply wax after few mins of heating...after cooling foen becomes thick..only when its hit i can apply..and its very painful😢what should i do?
i made it and it kinda worked but when i try to mold it and then use it, it sticks really bad to my skin and hair. any tips?
Hi thanks for the info I was hoping to see a video or you mentioning what happens if you undercook your batch what if it's not runny but not as firm either how do we eliminate the excess water to make it candy like?
Wait?! What? Your recipe in the description is different from the one your  mentioning at 2:04. Which should I use? 2 cups  of sugar + 1/2 cup of water + 1/2  cup of lemon or 2 cups of sugar +1/4 cup of water + 1/4 cup of lemon.
Hey! Can i make this without lemon juice or use another thing instead? Thank you
Hello,I've tried  your recipe about 4-5.. I did right the last time but It turns into a "stone" when it is cold.. what can I do for this?
Hi, will you still be making a video for each kind of sugar? Maybe they're already on your channel and I can't find them. Very possible 🙆🏼‍♀️ Anyways thanks for all your videos on this topic. Subscribed and staying tuned!
Can you put it back on the stove after it cools and reheat it to get it firmer?
Thanks for this.  What type of plastic containter do we need to get to use in the wax warmer?  I've seen some containers with numbers on the bottom.  Which number do I get if it matters?  I'm sure it does. lol
Can you overcook it? I tried to make sugar wax and it definitely was NOT the 2nd consistency, I used your bowl-of-water test to rapidly cool it. It was similar to or harder than the 3rd consistency you showed in this video. I thought it wasn't good anymore so I tossed it; but would I have still be able to use it as a cold wax after Store&Pour and then reheated like in a microwave?  Or should I have used it ASAP with fabric strips (once cool enough) before it reaches its true consistency, and not as a cold wax? Or does something about overcooking it make it lose its sticky/waxing properties?
How long after sugaring for hair removal do you need to repeat the process for the next time? How long before you have to do it all again? 1 week? 2 weeks? 4 weeks? Longer?
Could you directly microwave the jar you're using to store the sugar with the sugar?
Can you just use a microwave to warm up the sugar ?
Why isn't the wax sticking to my body 😭🗿
Thank you!!! Your videos are really informative!!! I haven't tried it yet but just curious, which method would you say hurts the least?
Ok I made this but here’s what happened, I cooked it to like 249-250 i could pick it up but immediately when it came in contact with my skin it was melting. Any tips?
If we realized after the sugar has cooled down that it was undercooked and a little too runny, is it possible to reheat it via stove or microwave to try and get it to a more cooked stage? Last time that I made it too runny I just used strips, but I really want to get it hard enough to just use fingers
About the pour and store: how long should I wait after taking the pan from the fire to pour  it in a container? Cause I imagine it would melt it if I do it straight away, but I'm also afraid of the wax hardening in the pan
what do you do when ur sugar melts on ur skin? it’s so hard when i take it out but always ends up sticking to my skin and melting
Beginner here, so if I use a thermometer I don’t have to whisk. Otherwise I do? Is this method the best one? I’m so intimidated bu it still. I bought some sugaring paste but when ever i try the folding it just gets so liquid and sticky. So i just applied and started which somehow worked 🤣
Heya! Great vid! So if the mixture is too hard. How do I knead it to apply? I live in hot country as u were talking about
Hey abetweene :) I have a quick question about this. Will it work the same with brown sugar or does it have to be granulated white sugar?
Where can I find these storage containers? Looked everywhere!!
you probably wont see this since this vid is so old but is there any way to salvage wax that you mixed too much water into during kneading?
How long did you have it on the stove?
How is it that there was a dark undercooked wax. It seemed darker than the 'soft' proper wax but was still way undercooked. I'm asking bc it's my first time making this and this is exactly what happened. The colour send to be getting dark and I got scared since most people warn against overcooking it but I as I knead it, it just makes in my hand. How can I ensure it cooks correctly?
Are we supposed to store wax in the fridge?
Can you apply it on more sensitive areas?
How to make it without a thermometer..??????. Please....
So the longer you cook the suger the harder it gets when it cools or does it make it softer ?
So if we have a wax warmer to reheat the sugar wax & turn it back into a liquid-ish stage to use the wax strips... does it matter if we make firm or hard stage wax to begin with? Because I noticed that soft wax isn’t strong enough for the hairs.
Can I use baby oil to sooth?
Why does my wax always turn out wrong?! First time it was too soft, second was wayyy too hard, this time I actually measured the temp and cooked it to 240, again way too soft and even looked too light.
How long does the sugar last?
Can you do soft sugar wax for thick/coarse and for Brazilian
Can you use this type of sugar wax for a brazilian?? With the strips though..
If I were to divide the recipe in half would it still work?
can i use a meat thermometer? i waited kept boiling until its 245-250f (with double ingredients) and it came out kind of weird and sticky (and there's dried froth on top too).
How can I do the hard wax without using a thermometer? I live in a tropical country so I think that would be the best for me
How long do I have to wait for it to cool down to use it
ive been sugaring for a long time but your videos have such great tips and i love the no kneading recipes. what kind of container exactly do you use for the wax warmer, is it like a soup takeout container? definitely would save my pot from getting as sticky lol
After the sugar is done cooking and you remove it from the stove do you pour it into the container while its still super hot or you you let it cool in the pot then pour it into the container??
Why does her pfp look like Bella poarch???
Wait can u make it without lemon ?
Where can I buy those containers?
So I’m using brown sugar, it’s been on the hob for about 8mins on medium/low heat (3) and it still hasn’t bubbled... what have I done wrong lol or is it just the sugar I am using ?
Can you tell us what a cup means? Like how much ML is it? Cup is Americana nd not precise
Hi! Really good content! How can you put it on a plastic container, without it melting?
So do you use any preservatives ?
where do you get those plastic containers that you can heat?
So I used white sugar & organic lemon juice extract and I noticed that I had to cook longer 🤔 anyone else have this problem?
Hi, I like your content.. and I do have a question for you... At 5:29 , may I know the perfect temperature to make that wax? I prefer using with wax strip and I would like to know the temperature so I can give a try .. thank you for sharing btw!!♥️
Where did you get those plastic containers?
Is it two cups sugar and 1/2 water & 1/2 lemon OR 2 cups and 1/4 water & 1/4 lemon  because the recipe is different from what was said in the video ? Help
Would Turbinado  sugar be cooked to the same temp? I still see sugar graduals after cooking it to the temp of firm.
Is it supposed to leave sticky residue
So the temperature after cooking doesn't have any affect right?
mine just hardens as soon as i take it off heat. what am i doing wrong?😭😭
Have u sold these yet!???
If your sugar is undercooked, can you put it back in the pot and cook it some more? Or just start over?
Do you have a link to the bowls you are using to store it?
when using brown sugar how would you know when to take it of the stove because i don’t have a thermometer to test the temperature but i want the sugar to be around soft and firm , any tips or advice??
is the cold sugar wax stored in the fridge?
Mine keeps turning out liquid-y, why? 🥺
Is that painful?
when do you put the syrup in there and can you substitute the syrup for honey ??
Can I use the firm wax without cloth?
Wait... in the video she says 1/4 c water And lemon and in the description it says 1/2 c each???
do we need to put the sugar in the fridge? or does it get hard by itself?
Those plastic containers where can I get?
I followed this method, used a thermometer and everything, but how come mine turned out chunky and filled with bubbles? What does this mean what am I doing wrong? T.T
Can I use lime instead of lemon?
After letting mine cool, it was extremely sticky when taking it out of the container. It was all over my hands and I could not mold it at all (yes, I cooked it to 240). Did anyone else have this issue?
Do I have to do anything differently if using brown sugar?
Then how to fix the watery content over hard wax, actually when I made hard wax few days later I found it watery layer over it making it useless. Is my wax gone to be waste ? 😭 What should I do plz kindly guide
Do you have to use lemon juice? If so what is it for
How long is the shelf life after making it? Waxing while during quarantine here😂
Hey I don’t see the containers you used for storing on you kit page... can you please drop the link? Thanks!
What if u don't have a thermometer
How long will this last? Pls answer
Where do you leave the containers to let the sugar harden, does it go in the fridge or do you just leave it out? :)
Mine came out like the dark one and it’s a bit firm but seems usable.... can I microwave it to soften it ? I don’t have a wax melter🤷🏿‍♀️
How long do i keep it on the stove?
What should I do if it’s too runny?
Somewhere here I read NOT to use it on the face?  Why not
Soooo what if the wax is super dark ? Can I still use it ?
Do you have any recommendations for a brand to purchase for sugaring, I have tried for a week to make mine and failed every time?
trying this a third time after finally getting a cooking thermometer but my sugar mixture looks very light, it doesn’t even have the butterscotch color you described in the faq video.. yet it reached the exact temperature needed to reach a firm ball stage? is this normal? like will it darken over time? should I keep it in a fridge?
Is this OK to use on eyebrows and lip
Anyone else having trouble getting it to the correct temperature with an induction stove? I can't get it higher than 230°F / 110°C and then it just turns blackish...
Is it possible to not use lemon during the whole process.. I mean if you don't have lemon... Can you make the wax without lemon.. Hope u answer my question.. And have a nice day ❤️❤️❤️
So how do you get the firmer sugars back to a pliable and usable consistency?
How come now we’re using 2 cups of sugar instead of 1 cup??
If ur sugar is under cooked u just throw it away? Is there any way to reuse it or make it able to become better to wax
I live in 30C room temperature, so what kind of Wax should I Make?
For the bikini area, wich do u recomend me? The hard wax sugar or the soft one that uses a cloth?   Pd: sorry about my english, It's a lil broken but I think that I explained myself ❤❤❤ love your videos
can you use brown sugar?
I undercooked mine first and second try 😅 thought it was ready cuz it overflowed.. Can I can cook it again but with more sugar or doesn’t it work like that? And what kind of strips did you use? Do you only use them for the thin, undercooked substance or also for the thicker ones?
I love your sugar wax videos!! just have a few questions... 1. If I make Soft Sugar then I'm able to use it when it's cold, but can I use it as as a strip wax sugar while it's still warm? 2. I tried making soft sugar using a thermometer, but when I reached 237F Wich is in the soft sugar stage it wasn't even close to soft sugar... I wasn't even close to strip wax sugar either... it's not particularly dry or humid where I live either... 3. in this video you say 2 cups sugar and 1/4 cup water and lemon... but in other videos you say 1cup sugar and 1/4 cup water and lemon... what is the right ratio? 1:0.5 or 2:0.5
So, is it safe to put the sugar in a plastic container right after you finished cooking it?
Can someone tell me when or rather if this sugar is expiring? How long can I store it?
hey i tried it making hard wax today as explained .however it didnot even stick to my skin ...what could  be the reason?
Having done the exfoliating and having clean dry skin....what would cause the sugar to not stick? It just slides off pretty much.
What's the point of kneading it and making it into a paste vs the pour and store?
if i dont have lemon juice what else can i use?
Hey, so I cooked my sugar to 260f and then let it cool in a glass container, then I put it in a plastic container and it firmed until the next day. Now it works when I use it but I notice that I didn’t knead it and when I use it, it gets sticky like it’ll come apart sticking around everywhere on my finger and the spot where I’m waxing. Should I knead it first before using it and also for the wax you did (250f firm stage)  can you warm that in a wax warmer and use it with strips?  The wax I have isn’t too hard or too soft it’s actually exactly like your firm one but it’s sticky after I apply it but I think it’s bc I didn’t knead it. Idk though. Thank you if you can give me some advice :) oh and when I do try to knead it, it gets sticky idk if that’s normal and I just need to continue to knead?
Does this help "strawberry legs"? (Dark comedones on legs)
If I buy the paste as it is do I need to knead it first or do I go straight on to using it?
What temperature does it have to reach?
I don’t have a thermometer. How long did it take for the hard wax to boil or reach the right temp??
hi! i have a question, lets say you undercooked the wax and poured it on a container already.. can you just reheat it on a pan in order for it to thicken even more? :)
sooo I cooked mine to just about 245 degrees and it’s pretty soft/realllly sticks to my skin. I’m not sure how I can use it. Do i re-heat it? Any tips? haha, helllllp, removing my quarantine body hair is almost all I can think of.
Help! I cooked to 240 degrees but my sugar is much lighter. It’s still fairly firm to touch with the finger but can easily be pulled up between two fingers and pliable. Can I wax with it or do I need strips? My husband is letting me test on him! Lol
Will you get the same results using sugar in the raw?
how long did you cook each type of sugar?
What stage is best for bikini or under arm wax?
ok so..if i undercooked the sugar..should i put it back in a pot and continue cooking it..or i can't use it anymore?
Hello! I have tried this several times and all of them were useless :( when it cools down it gets hard as candy, what am I doing wrong, or how can I make it softer?  Is there a way to fix it?
Can I just buy a bag of Carmel, melt and use💁🏽‍♀️?
what is the best stage wax for leg hair?
I microwaved mine for the recommended time, and when it finally wasn't too hot for me to handle, it was very solid. Anyone know what I did wrong?
I just made mine and am going to let it cool :) My thermometer only reads to 220, so I just had to leave it cooking a little longer and kinda guess! If it turns out being undercooked, is it possible to put the same batch back on the stove to cook longer?
What's the longest amount of time you've stored it and where did you store it?
Can you add cocoa powder to this wax? I use it when strip waxing and it makes waxing less painful
Approximately how long should the mixture be on the stove for? I tried to make the cold wax and as soon as the thermometer hit 240°, I stirred it to check the consistency and it was so watery!
Do you have to wait 7 days?
Do you put the wax in the fridge to cool?
What different powders are safe to use?
It is winter now where I am. I have made the soft paste but it has gotten quite hard now. Do I have to knead it now or can I just warm up the paste and use it?
So for the undercooked wax, which can be used for strips what temperature did you cook that one on?
So is it 1 cup of sugar to 1/4 lemon juice and 1/4 water or 2 cups of sugar to 1/4 cup lemon juice and 1/4 water? You had 1 cup on other videos, but here you said 2 cups.
I bought a sugar wax and used it once and just put it on my dresser, but when I went to use it again it had become very runny and syrupy. Can I salvage it at all? Or should I throw it out?
What temperature is the “undercooked” one that you used with a strip? As id actually prefer to use that with reusable wax strips. X
where did you get your containers?
Is it two cups of sugar or one like in your other videos?
can I use this mixture to do my eyebrows too?? lmao 😂
Which is better for more course pubic hair ? That will give you a nice clean surface?
Can you reheat the undercooked stuff to cook it to hopefully become soft ball?! 😅
Can you only use a plastic tub to store the cold wax ? ( the wax you can use without the cloth strips )
What temperature do you have the wax when you are using it for waxing?
What I can’t get with is these measurements? Are you saying 1/4 cup of water and lemon juice?
Wat does it mean after making it sugar wax wen I cooled it down and tried it only a few secs it became hard whilst I was testing it wat hve I done wrong ?
How to make that upperlips wax you showed to apply?
Mine still seems to be too sticky and I have reduced the amount of water. I tried to cook a little longer and ended up with lollypop stage....any advice?
what if the sugar dosent turn brown and it just stays white
Can you do a video dedicated to hard stage sugar without using thermometer
So what do I do if it’s hard but leaves syrup behind on my finger?
Do you store this in the fridge at all? Or just keep it in a room?
Where do you get these cloth pieces?
How can I use my overcooked sugar plzz help
If i used fine sugar... is there anything i can do to make it work? T_T
Could I cook the sugar in the oven to get it to a specific temp? I don't have a cooking thermometer thing
If you dont have a wax heater can you heat it in a microwave?
How often the hairs get re-Growth?
Anyone else here during quarantine trying to wax themselves? 😂
WOULDNT THAT GET U ALL STICKY???
Ok so strip wax is 230-235. So the wax that I want to pull off of myself without strips is the last 3 stages after strip wax? Also I want to do the firm and strip. I'm confused is it 2 cups or one cup for all plus the water and lemon? Thank you
Does it work with lime juice ?
I was looking at how to make caramel for baking, and when I was watching the beginning of this video I was wait what!?
Can we just use water and sugar??
How many minutes do you cook each form of sugar wax for?
why B-Soda and lemon?
Guys I’m really bored here. Could someone debate me in the comment section? On literally any topic I’m so bored and I need to make some friends. Please?
How long will the sugar be preservable? And I also wonder if you should keep stirring when it starts to boil. I get different results when stirring or not. It gets more firm when I keep stirring. Maybe because the temperature will be the same in the whole pan?
If you don't have a theometer how do you know if it's the right temperature?
@abetweene hey! I bought sugar wax but its runny, like ur first stage. And I want it to be spreadable like ur second one, like runny but take out all hair using cotton strip. How to do that??
ok so I stayed within 110-116 celsius and it became rockhard like I can’t even get the spoon i used to mix it out of it once it completely cooled, what did I do wrong (I cooled it in an ice bath and stirred it to ensure the cooling was even and then kinda kneaded it with the spoon, was that the problem? I saw someone else do that to their wax)
Soooo which one do I use for a Brazilian wax? I’ve watched All of your waxing videos and I am so confused 😓.
does someone know if it's ok to store the wax right away into a yogurt-type container? (or sour cream container whatever you wanna call it)
My sugar wax is made for strips but it’s not sticking?
Is there a way you can make wax without using sugar
My sugar seems firm and won't stick to  my skin even with powder. Help??
Hello there! just one question. How long can I store this sugar wax? Should I store the wax in the plastic container inside the fridge?  Thanks! :)
Do you have an Etsy shop?
Does cold sugar wax that are sold  still the same ?
Question if anyone can answer, I wanna try sugaring my bikini line and I was wondering doesn’t anyone know exactly how with a sugar wax?
Instead of my using a warmer for the hard wax, can I mix the soft wax and hard wax to apply on the hair?
Please can you make a video on application of sugar wax? also do you need to apply with a wax strip or can it be applied without a spatula and strips? Thanks
What do I do if when my sugar dries it always gets crystallized, I did everything you said to do but no matter what it will never work.....
Can you sell the sugar you make?
Can someone please tell me does this pain
Can you use brown sugar?
Hey so I tried your method a couple of times and I’m always a little torn between cooking until the right temperature or the right color... because my paste never really turns out this amber color and more like actual honey - so much brighter.... I’m always afraid I’ll undercook it. And advised on how to fix this?
I thought she was rolling a blunt and I was like...did I press the wrong vid?
Can you just sell your caramels like cute little french candies? I will seriously buy them. DM me at @Bimbinha if you are willing to do this. XO
Is it possible to fix undercooked wax??
can you make it without lemon juice?
can you use this to remove blackheads and whiteheads?
hey, just to clarify, when it boils on med-high heat, you leave it there and wait to reach the desired temp? you don't decrease the temp after boiling first? I keep failing at this. I've wasted so much sugar already 😢
My sugar was really runny still?? What am I doing wrong??
What kind of Texture would think is best for Brazilian wax and under arm hair
What if you don’t have a thermometer? Are there other ways to tell?
How do you wash these dishes???
Can you simplify this as much as possible?! Maybe start out with the softball stage and do a video just on that because this video is too confusing and all over the place!
can i just stick it in the fridge for an hour or so after i cook it to speed up the cooling process???
Beforeor it will boil, does the sugar have to dissolve first?
I'm using white sugar (cuz it's really cheap)  bit mine is still clear when it gets to 250 degrees and still pretty maleable like it's in between strip and soft ball not firm ball. Are you using turbinado sugar for yours to have that color and do the temperatures matter depending on the type of sugar?
did you leave it in fridge or out in the open?
Okay so if I live in a hot climate I should make the hard wax, knead it, then store it in the fridge? Then take it out and use it at room temp?
Uh and what if you don't have a thermometer?
Does anyone know? If you can achieve hair removal with the soft wax you can use straight out of the container why would anyone use the wax you have to heat?
Every time I’ve tried to make the wax in the past I always think I have it right, but when I take it out and start trying to knead it... it gets hard and breaks like hard candy. Is this because I have over cooked it?
I dragged mine and it became really dry and hard why?
Can we use lime juice???
how can i get it to work w vinegar??? it keeps turning hella hard
can you use the sugar a little while after you’ve made it? once it’s cool but still not completely stuck? like with the stick and a cloth
My mixture reached the appropriate temp for firm but when I went to pour it in my container... I realized not all the sugar dissolved and settled to the bottom. I mixed it well before putting it on heat, so it should not have had time to settle. what did I do wrong?
How do you keep it from hardening when it cools?????
I think I’ve got it down, except it gets so sticky is sticky too my body?! And I don’t no how to deal with that? X
How do you get to that syrup/undercooked stage that removes all the hair ? What temperature would that be? Does it stay that liquid or did you have to heat it ? Thank you !
Can I ask about how you use the different waxes after you put it after you put it in the wax warmer. Example, do you use the harder wax for armpit hairs and the softer wax for leg hairs.
which sugar wax works best on peach fuzz? I have a lot of peach fuzz on my face. I tried a gelatin face mask yesterday but it didn't work and just now I tried a sugar wax (recipe from a different video) but it didn't remove it either. ☹ I have questions about this video, too. is it really ok if the sugar hasn't caramelised after it reached the desired temperature? and can I use the waxes cold or what is the best recommended temperature? I also tried my wax on my arms but I feel like my hair just doesn't want to stick to it...
which stage is best?!?!?
Ugh!  Mine is undercooked!  Can I just put it back on the stove and cook it more?  Also, did I hear you correctly that if you had a big enough pan that it wouldn't boil over it wasn't necessary to keep stirring ?  I thought I was keeping it from burning.  I know this isn't a new video but if anyone is here and knows the answers I'd love to hear from you.  Great videos abetweene!
How cool should it be before i put it in a glass container?
Why do you knead the sugar? Is it something you have to do?
What temperture was the undercooked wax strip one

How many minutes does it take to get to all the 'ball stages' ? I don't have a thermometer

I dont understand can you eat it?
What if u don’t have a candy thermometer?
So if I put it in the warmer do I have to use strips? Or does it turn into hard wax that I can rip off
How did I only discover your channel now? The quality and time that goes into your videos is phenomenal. Thank you for doing what you do. Keep it up, you’ll build it into an empire no doubt 💰
mines under cooked. How long do you recommend putting it in the microwave?
So I got a thermometer and I took the sugar off the stove top when it reached 245, but then the temperature kept rising for a few seconds and got all the way up to like 270? Is there a trick to getting it off at the right time?
After making the sugar wax, how long will it keep for? Also, does it need to be stored in the fridge?
When you use your hard wax in the pot, what setting or temperature do you set your wax warmer on? Thanks for the quality information ❤️
I tried making some, but as soon as it got to temperature, the color was not dark at all. I added it back to heat some more. It darkened a bit. Will it set up as it cools? Or should I be doing something different?
Mine was undercooked like you said, so what do I do? Do I have to throw this one away??
I want to make the soft ball sugar but how can I know what temperature am I boiling it at? (I use a cooker, and it may sound stupid but there's no way of knowing). I did this a couple of times int he past but the sugar would turn hard very fast and couldn't use it. It was a mess
What about the ones like me who tried it and not one single hair came off? What am i doing wrong
what type of container should i use is glass safe won't it shatter and plastic wil melt?
can you make it without lemon juice or can it be substituted with other things?
I don't understand what I did wrong.. I boiled it on medium heat until it was 235°F and it's such a light colour, almost clear?
is it right that 2 cups are 424 gramm and 0,25 cups are 29 ml?
How does the pate not stick to ur hands, I once used store bought sugaring paste and it was soo sticky and weird
I cooked mine until softball stage and it cooled rock hard 😞can’t put it on I followed directions exactly??
Can you store this in a glass container? Done have anything plastic. Also if so, how do I keep the glass from shattering, since you can't let the wax cool before pouring it?
Can I use it for each body part? Thanks for being awesome xD
why does it smell so horrible tho
Mine looks really burnt it’s like almost black is that ok ?
Can you put the cooked liquid in the container you were using as soon as you take it off the oven? If not how long do you wait?
My wax gets super hard very fast when i start needeing it. And i can't use it :( how come?
How do you fix it when it’s undercooked
Hi, I prefer to use strips but haven't found anything about temperature in any of your videos. What temperature would you recommend for strip wax? Can I use it cold or does it have to be warmed? How long can I store if for? Also, what strips are better, non woven or muslin? Thank you very much 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
I want to make your sugar wax but just to use with strips. Any of these will work with strips?
Ok soooo i tried doing the soft wax and took it out at the same temp but why does it look under cook like it’s still transparent???
I am wondering, is there a reason why my sugar does not get the fine hairs? It works on thicker hair, but the fine ones do not get out. I bought my paste, is not diy and I don't know what I'm doing wrong😔
can you write the correct gram for the shugarpaste of whater, shugar and citrus?
Do you store in the fridge or at room temperature?
What's the measurements in grams? Sorry I have tried to look but it's so complicated!!!
Is there a way I can make a cold version and not a lot I just need it for my nose
Does this work on any type of hair that isn't peach fuzz?
Can I use lime juice instead of lemon?
can i sub lemon juice with lime juice?
Does it get stuck to the pan
I'm afraid I might have undercooked mine. When I poured it into the container it seemed really liquidy. Wondering if that will go away once it cools?
Which sugar do you recommend, white or black sugar?
I don't have a thermometer, so after the mixture starts to boil, how many minutes should I let it cook?
I usually make the firm wax and I always heat it to the right temperature, but it never comes out as orange as yours does. Am I doing something wrong?
I don't have a thermometer so how do I know when to stop cooking?
I accidentally cooked mine to that very dark color that’s thicker than a bowl a oatmeal 😭😭 What do I do now?!
Lol if I wax with candy will I become a sweeter person?
I waxed my upper lip, and I treated it like you said in your videos and now when I touch the left area its sore! Can you help? I've tighten my skin as you said and followed everything❤
When I cook the white sugar to 240°F it is still very light gold (like it is undercook) and does not have the same color as the sugar on your video. What am I doing wrong ? (I live 300m above sea level so it should not affect the boiling temperature)
5:25 can you tell me how u get that consistency?? How much sugar lemon and water u used n for how much time u boiled it on medium flame??
how long can you save the wax for?
Why the short videos? I still can’t get it right. Please do a detailed video 😫
Why is the lemon juice important?
if you want it to be the"to soft" version that is good with cloth strips, what temp do you cook it to?
Did you set them in room temperature or in the fridge?
Is it just me or does your sugar go hard and brittle when you need it
so even if its overcooked you can try to knead it and come back later so that its pliable? i tried to make your microwave sugar wax mine came out hard as candy and i was able to knead it but i wasnt able to apply it to my skin
Where did you buy the wax warmer?
can i use an old pillow case as a cloth strip ?
I wanna prepare soft sugar wax but I dont have the temperature machine. What do I do? Plz help
On different occasions I have attempted to make this wax and I’ve either almost succeeded or failed at it every time , so what am I doing wronnnnngggggg????🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️
Can you please do the  cups in ml and grams🤷🏼‍♀️
How do I keep it from getting too sticky on my skin? I've cooked it to both the firm and hard ball stage and it still is too sticky. :( I'm following the directions exactly too.
Why does it keep sticking to my hands????
‘Do you wanna try sugar waxing but you just wanna pull your hair out?’  Meanwhile in my head: ‘well that’s what I wanna use sugar wax for isn’t it???’
I need help😩I tried to make it but when I reach the desired temperature the color is not dark or amber color. Why is this happening? I’m I cooking it too fast?
I cooked it to 240 and let it sit for 2 hours to cool, but when I try to use it as a strip wax. The sugar seems to be undercooked, is there a way for fix this issue without overcoming the sugar? Should I let it solidify completely and knee it?
Did you pour the sugar in the container while hot or did you take it off the range, wait, then pout?
do you ever store the wax in the fridge? or can i just put it in a plastic container and set it to the side until im ready to use it?
If i can’t knead it does that mean i cooked it too long?
After I knead, I always end up with a hard piece of light yellow sugar candy that cannot be spread or moulded. What am I doing wrong?
What is the temp on the last wax that you can just apply and wax?
How long should the hair be before you sugar it? Should you trim it if it's too long?
So are you supposed to warm the sugar up before you use it, or just apply it when it's room temperature?
The sugar that was undercooked but useable as a strip wax - what temp was that cooked to? I can’t seem to get that right!
Omg what does it mean if it gets too hard?? Did I cook it too long or not enough?? I was trying to make a soft ball but my thermometer doesn’t go up to 240.
How much is one cup in grams? because everytime I look it up on the internet there are different answers and they also differ between flour and sugar...
What if I don't have a thermometer???
Please respond. Can you use flour instead of arrowroot  powder?
could you use this on your lady bits??
Do you have to use lemon?
Can we keep them in those little package and eat them as candies ? 😂😍
I have been trying and trying. It never works for me. Everytime after I knead it, it turns to a solid hard candy. Like if I took a hammer to it, it would shatter. Any idea what I am doing wrong? I swear I take it off the second it starts to golden.
Fuck.. Can I just cook it simply?  We dont have a thermometer. I give up.  I always end up cooking a candy! I'm just gonna buy a wax from Watsons. Save more time and patience.
So which one are we supposed to make???
The one that i did solidified when it cools down and when i try to knead it, it wont work. Does it still have a chance?
How do I make the second undercooked batch. I'm comfortable with using the paper strip thingy. Not free handing it.
Can I fix undercooked sugar like put it back in the pan or something?
What if you don't have a thermometer? How can I still make it???
hmm.. tried doing it with a thermometer for the first time, boiled to 240F/116C, but it is not at old golden, more like very light yellow, like honey in water... should I keep boiling or how should I handle this? Thanks for help :S
So if I would like to use sugar wax with strips I need to make the soft wax and heat it enough to make it thin and spreadable?
Why is mine turning hard like candy!!!!!!!
I tried it and I loved it but I have one question. When I warm it up in a wax warmer and i spread the sugar wax over my legs. It is very thick. How can I make sure I can make a thin layer. Is it the temperature or the recipe?
Is the 240° cold wax just sugar or sugar water and lemon?
Hi, can you tell me the temperature of the wax you showed at 5:23? Is that the firm ball stage? Pls reply
I first started waxing and I got a few bumps 😔😪😭 any way to get rid of them?
Is the difference between the three of them just how long u let them sit ? I’m so confused
so is it 2 cups of sugar to 1/4 cup of lemon juice and 1/4 cup of water?
Could you make a video about strip wax... the best method, kinds of material you should use .. basically the does and don’ts for home strip waxing 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
What was the temperature of the second undercooked version? That looks easier to work with than the paste types.
I tried it 4 times.When I cool it becomes crystally.What can I do??  Any one's guide??
So I tried this for the second time today. I'm having trouble. First of all, it doesn't seem to be doing a thorough job at all and I keep having to go over the same places repeatedly (sometimes to no avail).  Second, I'm getting red bumps raising up on my skin afterward. Is this normal? What am I doing wrong?
Heyy.... How is your paste so clear ? Do u use fine sugar? Ive tried 5 times now .... Failed every single time ..... The paste has granules of sugar which make it very hard to knead then eventually hard for use or anything at all! HELP ME PLEASE
How do I go straight to a thin wax to use with strips? I've never done it and flicking it seems intimidating. I want to use strips but don't know how long to cook it for or how to let it cool down without getting too hard.
Can I use this on my face? Or do I need other type of sugar wax?
HELP!! I tried to make the hard wax because it's hot where I am, but it didn't work. It would only rip out like one hair at a time and go hard after the second attempt. What am I doing wrong? Should I try to make the soft or firm instead?
Sugar keeps cooking even after pot is taken off the heated stove. Once the sugaring paste/wax has reached the desired temperature, would it be wrong to stick the whole pot into a cold bath as in to shock it so it would stop cooking? Thanks for the tutorial :D!
Am I the only one that want to eat it?   No, just me ok...
Can I wax my mustache off with this?
Could I do this without lemon juice? Or what could be a substitute?          ...I just realized I need to change my pfp lmao
Can you make this with powdered sugar?
Can I use it like normal wax? Like apply it and use strips
Did this sugar wax remove hairs from pubic parts
If you made you're firm sugar how do you store it. Do you put it in the fridge or just keep it at roomtemprature?
hey, what if I dont have a thermometer?
What are the conversions for the measurements
Interesting! I want to know what temperature of sugar wax if i want non knead or the undercooked but dark color? I need spreadable sugar wax consistency.
does the lemon juice have to be from a fresh lemon?
i dont really get it so is it all the same wax, same results, but soft you can use while cold, firm you can also, and hard u have to warm it?
So what temperature should i bring my wax to if i wanna use the cloth strips?
I cooked mine to 255 and it turned out runnier and lighter in color than the one you cooked at 240. In fact I haven’t been able to achieve a dark color at all. Should I just cook it to a higher temperature??
Can you use sugar waxing cold?
So what's the best temperature?
How do you wax your arms without bruising yourself
So do you sell your sugar for sugaring? I would like make it but I prefer to buy it already made 😁
Does it work with brown sugar too?
So, which of the first 2 batches was the best?  I'm not sure if I should heat to 240F ... or  250F
I am trying and made the paste for the first time. But idk what I did wrong that the paste just doesn’t stick to my hairs. I rub it over and over the hairs and the sugar wax doesn’t stick to them :( can someone tell me where I  went wrong???!
Can u use it to wax my head & face?
Uhm... Am I not supposed to stir after it starts boiling?? Cause mine is golden and all, but gritty, and not transparent at all...
is there a way to do this without a thermometer?
I’ve tried this so many times, but every time my wax is cool enough to touch, it gets too firm to stick to my skin or pull any hair out, it just rolls like it’s over Cooked, even though I remove it AS SOON AS IT STARTS TO GOLDEN (sometimes even before that!) what do I do?!?!
Hi! I heated up my sugar to 250 degrees F, but I don’t get the same color. Is this normal?
question, at what firmness should you cook for bikini waxing?
Hey so I tried making the sugar wax, mine is still runny even after a day to cool so it’s more of a strip wax. Is there anything I can do to make it harder so I can have it in my hand, like a hard wax?
I have a serious question. So the “hard wax” in this video can be used in place of the same hard wax that’s used in waxing salons? Meaning that I can warm this hard wax in a wax warmer and spread it on my sensitive areas and rip it away once it’s solidified enough without using cloth strips just like they do at waxing places? ... I’m just trying to save money and not hurt myself lol
Help! Cooked to 240. Color looks golden. Kneaded while warm until color went lighter and seemed opaque. Feels sticky, but does not pull out hair When it cools completely it's rock hard. Ideas?
Have you tried it with xanthan
How about a pre and post wax care routine
How long do you cook the soft wax? I really can't see the color when it's boiling.
You are so helpful making these videos. But I am presuming there is no solution to saving an undercooked wet mixture?
Hi my name is Sophia and Im 13 year old and get really bad razor burn on my legs so  I looked into sugaring and I found you videos and I wanted to say they are so cool !  but I had a question and that was and  how can do you know when it is cooled because  I keep burning myself when I stretch it and need it or put it on my legs?
I always cook mine exactly to 245 but it's still way too runny and liquidy so idk what I'm doing wrong? I let it go a little more one time but then it got way too hard and overcooked so fdksalfjdskafjdska;jklfsd
i cooked the sugar wax until it was 240 degrees and when i took it off and put it in the container, it’s white and it barely browned. did i do something wrong?
I have a question again. When the sugar is done. Do you put it in the fridge with top on or do you let it cool without top in room temperature first? I get some crystals in the sugar and I put it in the fridge with top on.
Hey can you use this on your face?
I don't have a thermometer, I'd there any other way I can know if it's reached the soft ball stage?
Hey! I've been using your recipe and I've had great results! but, what do I do once the paste gets too white and sticky and I can't use it anymore? I tried sticking a new piece of paste to it, but it seems to work just for a little bit. Do I just throw it away?
Can you pleaseee make a face hair removal ?
Is that edible? If i made that and its edible i would eat it all!
So I made some sugar and it came out really really really hard and dark- I didn’t have a thermometers the time that went above 200•f (I’ve been moving so it’s been in a cool dark box for about 2 weeks) so would I be able to warm it on high for 30 second intervals until i can pull some out or is that safe to just use a stick and wax cloths instead?
When you remove it from the range do you pour it in the container right away? Or wait till it cools a bit?
So the hard wax is better for doing sensitive areas though right? I keep trying to heat it up for my brazilian but its always so hot and by the time it cools enough its too hard for me to use it 😭
BTW...is there a way to add fragrance to wax?
So I made it like this the cold wax version cause I live in a hotter climate and left it to cool down and then I took out a piece and formed a ball between my fingers after playing with it and now its not sticking to my skin even after I have powdered my skin?
How long does the sugar have to be at the desired temperature for? I removed mine as soon as it hit 240 for example, but it ended up being way too undercooked.
So use sugar & water then boil it at those temperatures for how long ?
So what do I do if I don't have a thermometer? I tried twice. The first time I used with lemon, but I added sugar. I was able to use it. The second time I used lime and it became like a hard fiber. Help 😣
Why is the lemon juice needed?
When I do waxing I get small bumps all over the place I waxed , how can I prevent them?
What’s the “correct temperature”?? Edit: and does it expire?
If I want to  wax my bikini area what wax should I use? The soft, firm or hard wax?
If I want to use it with strips, I generally like that better, how warm should it get then? Thanks for a really good video!

You can still eat this tho ?
What was the ingredients and amounts of each again?
Do you start timing your sugar at first when it's already mixed and placed in the cooking pot?
With caramel? 😯 How do you not end up eating it all? I’m such a sweet tooth!
So if you make a wax too hard or at the hard ball stage you just need to warm it a little to use? What if it's Rock solid? Do you still just get it warm enough to use?
This mixer is being  after cold so hard that I can't use it How can i keep this mixer soft?? Need help
I don't have a thermometer ☹ is there a way to do it without one?
Sorry I got a bit distracted during the video... So I don't have to knead it, I can just let it cool and use it?
How does your sugar become pliable even when completely cooled? Mine always turn rock hard even though it’s not in the hard stage yet.
Does it have to be fresh lemon or lime or can you use concentrate
I tried to do this and I let it go to 121 C but it is still to soft (or watery). When it has reached the right temperature, should I let it boil for a while or take the pan off right away? I took the pan off the stove right away (twice) when it reached the right temperature. But cannot use it.
I live in a very cold.climate so what should I do?
Can I just buy some caramels knead them a bit and use those?
Can you wax your under arms with this type of wax
Can you use something else than Lemon juice?
Can you cook it in your wax melt since it has the temperature on it? If so that would be so much easier and worth the purchase! Lol

i want to eat it 😔     is it just me ? i know that weird
So what if I was kneading the sugar and put too much water on my hands? It’s slightly too liquidy. Help? ):
Hi abetweene. I watched your video's a lot and thank God: I can do sugering! Hoeray! But I can mostly use one sugarball 3 or 4 times, it's sticky very fast. Why is that? Can I use less water or... Softball I cannot use because its sticky directly. Maybe your experience can help me.
So yesterday I made wax. I tried to let it sit Forever then mixed it with my hands but it was so sticky. Did I not Cook it long enough?
Do you heard about the ingredient called 'guar gum' ? It makes your paste even more elastic and smooth - do you also try this in your recipe?   I have some guar gum here but I don't know if this really works...🤔
Can you use this on your face?

Wait. So how do you make the more liquid one? The dark one with the strip?
mine was vv watery, did i not boil it long enough?
idk why mine ends up being to liquid even though i put even smaller amount of water than lemon juice. any advice?
Do you think it would be safe to wax my beard with this? :(

Is it safe to do a sugaring wax on your private area
is it fine for my sugar wax not be stored on a fridge because the wax that i made became so hard when i put it on the fridge and i have to heat but its so easy to be sticky
What if you don’t have a candy thermometer :(
So I have a question... Please answer this  Ok so I happened to make an undercooked wax, according to your video, and I didn't want to waste the was and throw it away. So I was wondering if I could like make it more harder by putting the wax back into the pan and then cook it again? Idk if this makes sense, but please answer the best you can. Thank you
Do you have to kneed every single piece you use with the soft wax?
Can you do a segment on how to purposely make the liquid version of sugar? I’m gonna try to use the strip sugar for my legs and brows 😬 And by purposely, I mean, is strip sugaring the same recipe as hard sugar but just cooked less? Or is it a different recipe all together?
which temperature did you cook the one at 5:24 to?
Before I made 2 batches of sugar wax! Perfect thanks to your vids! Now...I am trying to knead and it just turns into a hard clear mess kinda like a jolly rancher...what am I doing wrong now??
What temperature did you cook the soft sugar that you used the wax strips with? I prefer using wax strips.
Why doe is harden? I'm trying here for 5hours at least, only the first batch was ok. I don't have a thermometer!!!😭😭😭
It would be awesome if you can show us how to sugar wax but the face? Because sometimes if it’s too hot it can burn the skin and if it’s too hard it can hurt the skin too! I live in the Caribbean, near Cancún, so it’s really humid and hot nd I’ve been trying to wax since your first video popped!! So def going to try the hard wax, it just hard for me to kindle but I guess it will get better over time, thanks a lot gurrrlll!
I did .5 cup sugar and 2 tbs of lemon juice and water following the cold wax method. I did the soft ball stage (235-240 degrees F) and the paste completely burnt ..? Any tips??
should my soft wax get harder and darker as i let it sit in a cold room?
Did you say how to get the "undercooked result but still useable" type of sugar? I prefer to use wax strips and that looks like it would work for me.
i have a problem in my country theres only lime lemon not the yellow lemon only the green one!!! can i do it with lime lemon?
How can i fix my over cooked sugar paste?it turned out into a stone  Plz tell me
Im planning to make this but im scared of how will it hurts, do you have some tips for it for first timers?
I was just in the shower shaving my legs, again, and thinking about how the sugar wax I bought on amazon doesn’t work. I think I’m heating it up to much..? Or maybe I just need to make my own cause they didn’t cook it properly for my humid climate. Thanks for the knowlege
How long does the cooking process take ? 😭
Still use fahrenheit really? meh...
No knead for what??
Mine never turns out this dark...I wanted to do the soft wax to pour and let sit, because I've burnt myself a couple times now.... oops. But am I cooking it too hot too fast? I don't understand.. I did this last night and it barely changed colors. I cooked it to 242 degrees. It seemed too sticky like you show here and it just spread clear. So I put it back on the stove till 250 and this morning it was hard as a rock lol.... I've wasted soooo much sugar trying to get this right.... I can't figure out for the life of me what I'm doing wrong. I'm using a candy thermometer too. Any advice anyone can give me would be soooo appreciated! I really want this to work...
Can you use any other sugar?
I did one cup of sugar to ¼ cup of water+lemon and my sugar hit 245F in less then 5 mins and with no color change... is that normal?
What stage of sugar is the one where you knead it and use it as is without strips? Like in your first video?
i made this sugar wax but when i started to knead it, it just got way too hard and i couldn’t knead it anymore! any tips? ❤️
Where do you live? So I can get an idea of what a "very hot climate" is compared to where you are
What's the optimal temperature to store them at?
How do you make the thick syrup that needs a cloth strip? I would like to try to wax that way.
Do you have a video on how to prevent ingrown hairs my legs look like a speckled strawberry 😭 it's horrible lol btw thanks for making these sugar waxing videos. **I refuse to give up 😃
Do I still need to oil my container?
I had a batch made few days ago, and after I watched this video I realized mine is in the hard ball stage consistency. So I tried kneading the little amount I managed to scoop out. At first it looked like it'd be a success (the ball was starting to get opaque while glossy) but it ended up melting down on my fingers. Any advice?
Yes can we get another video on using cold vs warm?
Can you show how to prep the skin?
i waxed my underarms and they got so irritated and i thought maybe cause it was the first time but it happens every time now. Any tips? no probs in any other area tho
How long can it stay stored before it goes bad or it is no longer usable?
In your beginner wax tutorial, the recipe was 1 cup sugar, 1/4 lemon and 1/4 water when you double it. On this video you do 2 cups with 1/4 lemon and 1/4 water. Was your beginner video the wrong ratio?
Which temperature do you cook yours to?
every time ive tried to make a sugar wax it aways hardens uo when i knead it? like it becomes rock solid, any advice for what i can do?x
Hey, does sugaring make you break out on your face?
Every time I start to knead/pull me sugar it turns hard. Like a sucker. And I can’t restore it from that even by heating it up. Am I heating it too much?
more please, I am very hairy and just wanted to know how is the best way to remove all the hairs,  paste or with fabric?
5:46 that happened to me if i didn’t use any water it would stick and if i did it would turn liquid, do i need to heat it up more? someone help!! lol
Did you store the paste in a refrigerator? If i did that will it be too hard to use?
