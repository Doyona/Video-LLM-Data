What do you do if you get an ice storm or a heavy snowfall with the flu cap that's spring-loaded or the flip top one?
Where can I find that chimney cap that opens and closes?
We have a fireplace that we don't use so we wanted to cover it up. We live in San Diego so we have wood exterior walls. But we don't want to completely eliminate the fireplace and chimney just in case, if we ever sell the house, we could reconstruct the mantle. Would it be a good idea to use something like this and then could we just demo the mantle and frame-in the opening?
HI Larry, quick question, Assuming the stove door is closed when not in use, what extra energy saving does the cap do? The air from the room won't flow through the chimney as it is stopped at the stove door. My new fireplace takes air from a pipe leading to outside for combustion, so no air will be coming from the house unless there is an air leak in the stove door.
Question - How would you close up the space just above the stove to stop that air from going up the chimney while t is running?  I'm asking because as you said my rectangle damper that I keep closed is not very air tight and I would like to somehow make it air tight.  The great thing is that I do NOT use the fireplace at all.  We just put decorations in it for each season.
And we are just ignoring the second wide open flue tile??
why silicone/caulk the cracks?? Just restore the cement crown wash with either a proper cement crown or a proper Crown Sealing Medium by Saver Systems??
What do you or anyone else recommend blocking the space around the SS liner and chimney wall at the bottom of the chimney. I want to block that air space with something non combustible
Why not seal the gaps between the new flue pipe and old damper area with some insulation or fire blam
