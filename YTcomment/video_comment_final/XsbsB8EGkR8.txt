Love this bag, I’m a beginner and with your tutorial I made it in a few hours, thank you, can I post a pic of the finished product?
Are the seams inclosed?
just a question, is there a reason you do no only use 2 larger pieces of material instead of 4? would that not eliminate the bottom/interior seam?
Sooo cute, but why I can see the sew in the innerlining... ???

How cut & stitch purse with many zip pockets
Greetings StyleNovice, I would like to know if I take the inner pieces of the bag and stitch them together, then the outter pieces and do the same would I still be able to make the box bottom? or do you have any suggestions.  I am trying to get a seamless lining.
Hey stylenovice! I just finished making your bag and have a question for you. The seams inside the bag are not hidden (instead they are exposed). Is it supposed to be like that or did I miss a step? :( Thank you so much, it's a very cute bag! X
is it me hearing wrong or they changed the orthograph of zip to zeup?
can the bottom get box shape too?
Really great video! But one question, what were the final dimensions of the box pouch?
Could you tell me how big the final bag is? The dimensions plz.... and btw very detailed tutotial, and very easy to follow..
I love this and would love to give it a try but is there a way to do this without the stitching showing on the inside?
when you say sew each of the four corners (referring to making it box shaped) it look like you just sewed across the drawn line, is that right or did i miss something or? idk im confused omg
What type of fabric is this?tia
How do you get rid of the extra fabric on the inside? Because I have little flaps of fabric from the last step to make it more boxy
Where did you get that rose/floral fabric? Its so cute.
Where did you get the material for this project from? It's really pretty!
Where did you get that fabric and where can I get it online?
What do you do with the ugly seam allowance that's inside the bag? This should be hidden between the layers.
how would this pattern work with faux leather???
Does this method leave raw edges ?
How many centimeters are there in a inch ?
I wonder.. in the tutorial you didnt mention the opening to rurn the bag inside-out. how did you do that when you've sewn all sides together?
I love this DIY but Iwas just wondering: is it necessary to use interior fabric?  Thank you x
where are you from?
.You make them so unique i love it! What if I don't have a sewing machine?????
