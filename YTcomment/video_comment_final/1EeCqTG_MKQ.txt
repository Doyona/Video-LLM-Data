Hi! I was just wondering if the Quilt-Smart Grid is still available?
That was fusible liner that you ironed the top fabric to? does it have a number and name?
Can someone explain half an each from what point I'm stuck on that part now. Thanks.
So cute just found you. Now question if I don't want to round bottom corners do I have too?
why not use a small zipper
Would you please put some of the quilt smart fusible grid in a Sew sampler box as we can’t get it in the UK. Thanks 🙏
I definitely want to see more bags.  I love this line of fabric and this bag is very pretty.  Can someone from FQS please tell me how many of these bags can be made from one package of the Quiltsmart?  Thank you!
Is there a difference between the grid panel and the Grid Fusible Interfacing Yardage Bosal? Thanks!
I am so new to this...can I use any fusible?  If i don't have the dots do I just fold on the seam?  thank you :)   I can't find the quiltsmart here and takes a few weeks for it to come in.  Until then I would like to try this tutorial out. :)
I love your blouse. Did you make it? Great tutorial 🤗
How do I find the quiltsmart panel?
Could you explain where exactly you are measuring from when you put the ruler down to trim? I have watched the video several times and am not familiar with on point. Thanks so much
How many bags will one quiltsmart panel make? Thanks for the cute tutorial.
The ruler you used was that the 6.5 x 12.5 creative grid ruler?
Are the zipper fabric pieces at the ends not sewn into the seam?  I like how neatly the zipper looks with this technique.
Can you use a shorter zipper? That was such a waste of a zipper, if you only need a shorter amount, wouldn't it have worked out?
What sewing foot were you using ? I tired to look I think it was 37D??
