Good video i did manage to adjust it until i got to the largest cog that's where i have a problem..on the largest cog the chain is rubbing on the tire..i have a fat tire ebike do you know how i could fix this?
Thank you so much very informative! I do have a question.. I have stem down shift assembly and when I TRY and shift gears..it wants to pull the sleeve with the throw of the shift arm. If that makes any sense. When i shift the housing wants to go with it. Any ideas on what I should be considering? Thank you!
My riverside 500 bike is out of alightment. Btw i have 9 gears on my bike. Is the smallest gear (cassette) means at the lowest number 1?
How do you take the pedals off a 15 speed gravity

hey, when I'm riding in easier gears the ride will be choppy. I will be pedaling then it will randomly stop giving power to the wheel but i am still pedaling then go right back to normal. What is this?

Do you have a spare SRAM X-3 rear derailleur mounting bolt/b-bolt/b-screw?
