Wouldn’t it be better to measure to the end instead of having to cut it short?
how do you do this if the plumbing continues past the wall and you can't put the drywall over the pipes ?
First fit was angled and way off :).  Is that because something wasn’t level which was assumed to be?
is that the standard leaving a 1/2'' gap between floor and drywall?
