What grade of steel wool for final cleaning? The package is hidden by the oil.
Any advice or comments about using boiled linseed oil instead of raw linseed oil?
what about with lead paint ?
Is there a method of getting the glass out of the lower sash, where the glass is inserted into a kerf in the meeting rail? I've found that this part is very difficult and I've broken several windows trying to remove glass from the lower sash
Does this window contains lead paint ?
What if you want to stain and varnish the inside? How do you deal with the paint that stayed in the grains?
Do you know of any tutorials on using similar products for old overhangs that are caked on with paint? I've been removing it with the Cobra paint remover, but it does not come off anywhere near as well as it seems to come off of your windows. It could be not using Linseed Oil, but I'm not sure if I should use that because I'm not sure if I'll be using Linseed oil paint for the repaint.
Can anyone tell me where I can find 'inorganic' linseed oil!? People using these terms should learn what they actually mean instead of just using popular buzz words.
How do you dispose of the old paint and putty?
WHERE  TO  GET  ROLLER  CHISEL  ??????????????
What is the chisel that has the guides on it? Is this a regular chisel that has been modified or the guides attached much like the ones used for stair construction.
Do you have to remove the old putty?  If it is solidly attached on the glass, could you not just apply new putty over it?
Where did you get that roller putty remover?? It's not listed or available at any of the sites you have listed. I'm doing 23 windows and that would help so much! Thanks for the great tips! Terri S.
sanding unnecessary? are you mad?
Are these pretty standard tools? (Scraping tools you use?) I am trying to learn enough to reglaze 15 old windows on our home in Georgia.
