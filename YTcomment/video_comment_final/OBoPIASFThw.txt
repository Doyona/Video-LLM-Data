Is it the same for 90-2003 Honda accord models?
My car doesn't have the hoses that deliver the fluid up to the window are they not visible?
Safety First not last have a future and a past ; ). Thank you for the video. Quick question for you, wondering if there is a drainage port with plug?  I have a 2008 Honda Accord, She's full with Summer washer fluid I now need to switch to the Winter fluid Thanks : )Tyler
So where was the leak? Fixing that might have been cheaper.
I have a Honda accord 2012 where are the windshield washers nozzles located?
I have an 01' Civic that needs the reservoir or at least the sensor replaced. Would you imagine it is similar to the Accord? By that I mean close the wheel well so as not too difficult to get at?
