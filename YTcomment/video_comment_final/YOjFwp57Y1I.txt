How to crochet a advanced beginner scarf
This is gorgeous, how many chains for the pattern or does this work with odd and even multiples?
Hi Heather , this stitch is great I love it . I'm using it to make a baby blanket and I'm using a k hook , have you changed color using this stitch ? How does it look if you have ! Thanks again . I just discovered your videos and I love them
