Hi, would you have any suggestions for a white paint colour, not stark white, that would go in a foyer, up the stairs and all around the hallway upstairs?  Doesn't get a lot of natural light going up the stairs and into the upper hallway, although it's a big space, though.  Want fairly light but not too stark of a white.  Will be painting the front cupboard door in black and all the way up the stairs there's black iron.  FYI, a room beside the foyer is shaker beige.  Any suggestions?  Thank you so much!
What about Super White ?
I’m hesitating between white dove and simply white which is better for bedroom  ?
Do you think edgecomb grey BM will go good with travertine look floor tile and or brown cabinets?
Im struggling with the white to choose I’ve had 6 swatches I was convinced I would want white dove I find it look almost too creamy or dirty? I want to have bright white cupboards and trim and I want to brighten the walls the floors and counters are a born shade and the rest of my homes walls are light shades of grey.  What I’m seeing on the wall is baby’s breath might be better with the grey tones and brushed steel in the room. I will be adding some warmth with natural wood tones/ what I’m shocked about it’s all the BM popular whites I’m not sure if in my space so if I pick a different shade I’m nervous I’ll pick the wrong cupboard white I want a contrast

We are painting our home in the Desert which will be an Air B & B.  We have decided on Dove White for walls and trim. What sheen for walls is best? We are also painting ceiling Simply White in a matte finish.
I love your you tube videos? Question: Would you use Chantilly Lace (Benjamin Moore) with Accessible Beige (Sherwin Williams). I ask as my walls are currently Accessible Beige used with Swiss Coffee. I had Chantilly Lace in my last home and love it. Would it work with Accessible Beige?
What white do you recommend in north facing rooms when you want to create a light and airy feel and use blues as accent colors?
