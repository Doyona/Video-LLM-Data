We, the reserve soldiers, will not participate in the fighting. Benjamin is a corrupt man who has become a dictator. Why doesn’t he send his son to Gaza!!!!? All we did was kill children and women and destroy hospitals. These are war crimes that will condemn us tomorrow before international law or before God on the Day of Judgment. We warn our leaders against our anger (we will disobey orders) this is a promise ???
what a disciplined. what a dedication.. that’s admirable.  🇮🇱
