When you study day at night without a rest, even if you get a 99.5, you'll cry. It is misunderstood for being a nerd but all they are trying to do secure their future, I takes a lot of dedication.

Fr, then they makes us question our marks too. 😭 Us after watching then cry for 99 be like: what are we even doing with our life?
Is it just me or did David really say "Hey Hey" like SRK?? 🤔🙌
Who get 69 I hate. My mind😂😂
When the class nerd says that all the other students feel ashamed of themselves 😂😂
That's because maybe she's pressuring by her mother?
When you work sooo hard, when you don't sleep many nights to complete the syllabus you'll not just cry for 1 mark but also for a 1/2 mark.   Edit :- Glad to know that there are so many people who can relate. Also thanks for the likes❤️
What happened to the failed one?
What some peopke don't understand is 99 will make a phrase like  "are you an idiot? It is just one point and you can't even get it" come out.
Did you guys notice the class clown just holding back and do the exam to score exactly 69 to make it funny?
what am I doing at the end?😂😊
Why the fuck is this in my fyp why the fuck watch 6 year old content with indian and Japanese couple doing shit bruh💀
Why is no one talking about the 69% 💀
Can someone tell me who from svt fell down??
When you study 24/7 for days and nights sacrifice everything just to study your happiness your comfort ,everything...and still not get enough marks how would you feel?......was i not good enough? Was all my work not good enough?..all my hardwork and patience...was that not enough?..........exactly that's how we feel......
When i heard the crying i thought it was the asian
Honestly, I'm no nerd but if I got 99 I'd get so angry Like, what did that point go for?
I remember once my friend got SECOND PLACE out of 48 students and she said she was laughed at by her dad. WHAT?

Why is it always the girl ?

Can you explain why 99 out of 100 is bad

When i got my math score i wanted to cry so bad but i put it all in and kept smiling but then this girl she started crying and crying, i asked her what happened and she said "i accidentally left a question so i lost ½ mark"... i was like, so you got 79½/80😶 and she's crying... "bro! What?" And she said,''You won't get it! I knew the answer!"... and this guy walked in and said, "She's not gonna die or something,  just leave!"
Tbh our class has a combination of class clown+ nerd/topper ...and i m an average so me be like :do i exist?
Who else noticed Dhadkan background music at the end
Where i live in America, you need a 70 or above to pass
And her Asian dad would ask her: where did the 1 mark go?
Why do I feel like.... it's about me?!?😂....when u r so used of getting high marks then even when getting 1&2 marks less makes me feel as if my whole life collapsed or my career is over ...etc etc
