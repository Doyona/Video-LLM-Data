genuine question why are stadiums half empty for this match?
Who designs these silly Tsisipas getups ??  Surprised he agreed to wear it
Why Alcaraz Garfia yelling ? It seem disrespectful ..
what a crappy job selecting these highlights...
when the top 5 players play against each other the game somewhat becomes predictable!! the top players have either a little bit more speed or topspin or quick forehand strokes or the ability to play that one extra shot apart from being well rounded in all other departments.   In this case Alcaraz is just quicker and good shots against him aren't effective enough.
Alcaraz grunts before he hits the ball????
How many comments of "Please don't make the thumbnail a spoiler of the result" do you think it will take for the FO media team to notice and respond to?
what I don't understand, with Novaks retirement there seems to be one player missing? Where am I wrong?
Who do you guys think is going to win? Sinner or Alcaraz?
What a high level. Great play from both of them, But Carlos is just too strong right now for Stef. And it's not as if Stef is in bad shape. His recent form has been excellent.
Can you imagine McEnroe, Sampras, even Federer celebrating after every point. No..
Why is Tsitsipas STILL SO AWFUL at recognizing / reacting to / handling drop shots? Why hasn't he learned since they cost him so many big matches, including the FO 2021 final?
What on earth was Tsitsipas wearing? He deserved the beat down just for that‼🤔
What a rivalry between Sinner and Alcaraz. Head to head, 4-4. It will be an epic match!
Who got the big j to win the title
How did you skip the tie break completely?
Whole highlights but not a single shot from the second set tie break?
why won't Nike release the shoes that Alcaraz wears? This is like the 3rd or 4th pair of shoes that Nike won't release. Anyone know the answer?
Did he inherit it from his father?? 🤔
