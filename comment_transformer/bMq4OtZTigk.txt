Will there be transgender NPCs? Asking for nefarious reasons
Is that the i-4 eye-soar @ 4:35 ? 😂
What do you think we need for the max graphics and high fps requirement of gta6
Looking gorgeous and I can't wait for the release date but the big question - will my humble PC with a Ryzen 5700+RTX 3060ti and 32 GB of RAM be able to run this game or will I need to upgrade to a much more powerful CPU ?
Well technically I been waiting for this PC release now for a WHILE - was hoping it was coming to PC in 2026, but if they DON"T then I am not buying it - since they delayed the console release by a year why should that delay the PC release?
What if Tommy Vercetti had a son, and that son fights to reclaim his father's lost drug empire? With the help of some old friends from Vice City.

Who bets Trumps Loony Tunes of Deviants ban this for being to much of their liking for others to be allowed it?2😂

When cops gets to you in GTA its not "wasted" We say "busted" for over 25 years. You can literally get arrested in all GTAs
Does anyone else think her boyfriend resembles Micheal from gta 5 ?
Is this the first time gta is going for realism in their characters look? They no longer look  cartoonish like gta 5.

when GTA 6 finally releases, most will play it on PC  those who already have an xbox or PS5 will play it on console
When the game launch people will notice 90% of the details will be missing.
Anyone wanna tell him this is all CGI and not using game engine?
Should the "ida" in Leonida" be pronounced the same as the one in "Florida"?
What a thumbnail its not even detailed edited the sleeves of the man dosen't match the sleeve of the character in the poster
Maybe 200 to 500 GB total game size for this game?
how are you gonna talk about Florida and call em crocodiles...
Why do you think Waezle news is a parody of Fox news when the theme is white and red ? CNN is white and red.

what if this is a reverse gta 3 story line where "claude" loves interest sells them out ... just reversed you know "Me too" 2023
gta 5 and and red dead 2 was build on the same multiplayer logic, riddled full of hackers that made online unbearable. Is that addressed in gta6 or are they just going to continue to pretend like it's not so and build of the same stuff?
when they in bed together, which character are you 😂
17:40 I’m guessing this is likely a riff on “let’s go Brandon” or something similar to that. In game president might have their own version except instead of Brandon it’s Andrew?

Did somebody forget the dodo in GTA 3? 😮
Will Sheriff GRADY JUDD be in the game to do his wanted announcements?
What if theres no gun stores like GTAV but a guy who sells guns in GTAIV since lucia has a criminal record and cant be caught up again

What a GREAT video for GTA fans 🏆🏆🏆🔥🔥🔥

how is wezel news a parody to fox news? im confused all it says is news and that makes it similar to fox news? lol this guy is a bit of a dumbass
how does a black man with a bandana tease asian gangs in GTA 6?😂😂😂
What if you can actually go to jail for your crimes in GTA 6 ?  THAT’D BE CRAZY! 👀🔥
Why does the voice of the narrator sound just like that dude from the cannabis News Network on YouTube
Running down a dream was on SA, Not VC. And isn’t Lucia’s partner called Jason or is Jason a completely different character?
Isn't the male protagonist named Jason based of the leaks? That's also how we found out Lucia's name as well
is Lucia the only protagonist?  or they’re two and are switchable?
Question is.. Can we, hopefully, bring our gta v online character over to Vice City?
You can’t play male characters?
Thought 'Running down a dream' was San Andreas?
Why tf you called it a dodge charger when it's clearly a challenger
Who else noticed the "Sunpass or Toll By Plate" on the highway sign?
Yay single mom simulator!!!! Do we get our foodstamps on the 5th every month in game?
Are those kids in the background wrestling in the mud at 13:51 ???
Anyone else notice the Miami Heat arena when Lucia was going wild on the highway ?
What an amazing detailed breakdown, superb video!
Cool they got a Peruvian & Haitian flag, but no Cuban flags … in Miami (Vice City) ?
wonder if we can play as the male too?
How Its Made: GTA VI Trailer
Animal Control side missions? Gator grabbing?
When this game releases its like only 3 to 4 months away from the USA world cup😭😭😭
Why do we have to play as a girl
2:32 a callback to gta 6 roots?
I'm not watching. A breakdown? A breakdown about a video game trailer?we not talking about the actual game. A breakdown of the trailer? Not about a game that may come out in 2025. A breakdown of a video game trailer?
How dare you to call it Pittwater. Its CALLED PISSWASSER!!!!!!
lol why you pronounce brickell like that?
Is this just cinimatics? Or gameplay?🤔🤔🤔
When it comes to detail Rockstars is like the Stanley Kubrick of gaming industry. Pure art. Can't wait to play GTA VI.
17:09 Did he just say Pibwasser ???
What's the BGM name during 16:10-16:52?
15:00 isnt weazel news from saints row 3 radio?
How are any of these "hidden details" when they literally put them in the trailer?
Why is everyone ignoring green Lamborghini at 8:28
I’m going to guess that the robbery we see in the trailer with Lucia and Jason is before she goes to jail as she doesn’t have the electronic tag on her leg yet as is shown in the key art. Maybe this is even part of the opening cinematic? It looks to me like all the scenes could be placed together in such a way that they start in the hotel/bedroom and then rob the store only to be chased by the cops and Lucia is then captured in a possible betrayal by Jason being the “bad luck” she talks about. Thoughts?
will Tommy Vercetti return in GTA 6?
are we sure we are not playing in the real world?
Why you talk about the graphics, it's an animated Trailer and no ingame content, makes no sense 😂😂😂
What baffles me is console release initially but they utilize computers to develop their games :/
why Florida becomes Leonida, weird naming.. 😅
Wasn't the dodo in GTA 3 as well?
What’s to say these are not pre generated?
Would this work on my xbox 360?
Is that a SKY TOWER(middle left) in the opening scene?
Will there be planes in GTA VI?
Im sorry… 17:08 pi"b"wasser???
At the gas stations, you can see the npcs lined up to pump gas… possible fuel mechanic?
Can we talk about even smaller details? Like the sand on the people’s feet at the beach 4:05
Why are PC players discriminated against?
What parts of this preview show the actual gameplay versus flashy looking cut scenes?
His name is Jason. How do you not know that?
Now let's address the big elephant in the room..... Can the character swim?
Has anyone at IGN slept since the trailer came out? Just chill, the game isn’t coming out for 2 years.
What are the PCs minimum specs for gameplay?
Wasn't 'running down a dream ' in San Andreas not vice city?
13:51 are those kids in the background playing in the mud??
When are people gonna wake up to this, they are literally showing you what you've ALREADY SEEN and have got 1.4M views from it. Wake up ffs.
do we have play as the chick?
can someone explain the clips that they are copying around the 10 minute mark?
How do you get 99 details out of 90 secs of a trailer😂😂
Why isn't nobody talking about the PMP600 from GTA IV :/
The girl at 9:43 is Eva Mendes… Right?
This is a reach.. but what if that beware of dog sign is a hint that Franklin is in the game. Possibly in that cop raid mission. Maybe he gets arrested ??
Could arrest Andrew be a reference to the Zimmerman case?
8:40 is that a cop driving an aventador?
Why does nobody seem arsed we still have to wait more than a bloody year other than me
Are we not in the 4k universe yet? He keeps referring to it as the HD universe. I'd say GTA4 and 5 are HD universe. We out of that now
How does this look more intricate then gta 5 apart from graphics
So does this game take place like in the 2020’s?
The different coloured maskes both wear while robbing the gas Station. Whats up with that?
Does anyone know if this is actually in game footage or not...
Yall gone break down trailer for the next year an a few months?
Is there even 99 seconds worth of runtime in the trailer?
The detail really is stunning. Has the engine & all tech been confirmed?
Why nobody noticing the razor/polaris looking vehicle in the mud pit?
So are we playing as a girl?
DID YOU KNOW???: There will be at least 3 different types of guns im GTA VI all of which are confirmed to shoot bullets
Why is it always cali or Florida....  Make one for ny or Philly or some 💩
13:50 are those kids in the back?
Where has the yacht at 19:14 come from? Did it go *through* the bridge?
Notice the difference in the color of the bandana's by the protagonists? Romeo en Juliette vibes?
did any notice Lucia weight change? HMM
Y’all more excited about story mode or online ?
Wasn’t running down the dream on San Andreas not vice city?
14:00 but why is this hillbilly so fine?
So 90% of NPC's are black?
Why is it in GTAonline a majority of the modders/hackers are in the IGN crew? 🤦‍♂️🤣
How can this guy breakdown every single thing my goodness.
Why are we being forced to play as a female is bad enough? We have to make these choices while playing c o d
Are they going with multiple playable characters like in GTA5?
Amazing breakdown. Isn't the male character named Jason?
In the states whats the difference between a police officer and a sheriff?
How love how gta breakdown is back and new mystery things will come on gta 6 ❤
When this is released I´ll lock myself at home and won´t see the sun for at least 2 weeks
So has there since been any new info on that "dolls of destruction" website that poped up? Is that real/related to the ingame band shirt?
What if........this trailer is just showing us more of Lucia and her partner and a glimps of VC and Leonida.  The next trailer will showcase Jason and more of VC and Leonida.(or whatever his name will be) That would be cool.
You couldn't make it to 100?
What do you mean it's not clear who the bikini girl is? It's Lucia lol plain as day
How did you not note that the liquor store is based off of Flanny’s/Big Daddy’s? Massive Miami Culture.
Can you stop bringing up rdr2 nobody cares about that game we're here for GTA 6
Wasn't "Running down the dream" in San Andreas, not Vice City?
Is it just me or does Lucia's partner look a lot like Michael in the trusts scene?
So is anyone going to mention the fact that every character in the trailer is overweight?
Can anyone tell which edition of gta vice City is this 7;20 ?
Why do we have to wait longer for the PC version though? It's actually not "unsurprisingly", it's highly illogical. Who cares about consoles?
Why the hell couldn't you make it 100!? REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE! orz
Does this make it the first ever Billion dollar game?
no one saw that there is kids in the mud background ? assuming they were kids because they look teens will the game have them walking around ?
Did he just say pibwasser?😂😂 For such a well researched video that's ridiculous
Do you guys think we will get a hunger bar aswell as a health bar like we do in rd2? Would love to see like a burger shot or some kinda food place where we can eat, also love to see a gym and a strength bar where you can gradually build up from skinny to muscle over time by hitting the gym and fighting
Why are they pretending to not know who Jason is 😂
Isn't the bridge around 9:06 the one used in one movie with J L Curtis and Schwarzenegger about him being super secret spy?
13:56 with the ThrillBilly mud club, you can see children playing to the left of the screen. So does this confirm children will be in the game?
Is this map already confirmed? Where did you get it from?
Why are you watching why are you watching did you effort this 😂😂😂😂
Is this a remake or continuation of the last ?
How did you missed " Ocean View Hotel" , THE Ocean View Hotel.
Why do pc get absolutely shafted
A part of me tells me Niko will be in this game or hinted towards him one way or another, didn’t Lester say he also went to vice city or either died?? One of the two?
where is the map at 3:22 and 5:28 from?
Anyone considered how much Lucia looks like Mary Linton?
At 14:12, the video was posted by LuchaLibreFan, and the next shot is a guy slamming onto a table. Maybe we will see american wrestling in GTA VI?
why don’t they put real brand cars
how yall got 99 details and gameranx only got 20
isn’t it Sound4Round (Sound Around) at 16:30 ?
Can we fast forward through 2024?
They talking like she's the main character, is it not a two character game ?
Can we see Lionel Messi as he is a player of Inter Miami?
Anyone else see the resemblance between Jason and colt from ghost recon breakpoint?
PS5 and Series X only? No crossgen?
If this time NPC just doesn't spawn and they have their own character route that would be awesome. But the thing is are the hardware in that year ready for this?
When do we get to see gameplay footage ?
Do people really pronounce it PiBwasser? Hilarious🤣
At 2:38, wasn't the Dodo from GTA 3?
What happened to the twerking police
When the supposed lucia tries to go viral, the guy who takes the video is in a dodge charger EV
Will the the game fit my PS5 lol?
Did you really pronounce it piBwasser?!
Why does everyone keep saying crocodiles, it’s Florida, they’re alligators
Do we really not know Jason’s name is Jason?
Why everyone thinks the main protagonists is Lucia?. Is Michael main protagonists of GtaV?
Has anyone call the phone number thats on the pawn shop sign?
why is nobody mentioning that’s there is gonna be ambient lighting features in car customization
Did he just say Pibwasser? Hahah. It's pronounced Pisswasser which should give a hint as to what it means.
WHY tf a girl is protagonist
Is it me or the guy looks like Tommy?
Would we get a version for the PS4 Slim ?
Where is messi in rockstar miami
When this game releases, people will not leave they're houses for days, weeks, MONTHS. And rightfully so lol
Is her partner not called Jason?
How many main characters are in the game?
Couldn't find a 100th eh?
10:17 is it just me or it's ricardo diaz mansion/Vercetti estate on the background?
Do you think this will be 60fps?
Was that someone surfing in the beach scene to the far right when zoomed out ?
How can you find details of a game that still haven’t decided what and how to make it yet
I'm pretty sure that white Cheetah Classic in the ocean view hotel scene is a nod to Miami Vice with the white Testarossa. Original GTA VC had cops in Cheetahs, maybe we will have a cop drive that in this game too?
So nobody else see the aventador?
Is lucia the one on the bikini that posed?
Is it me or does the male protagonist resemble Jim Caviezel?
Is it possible for Rockstar to reduce the views over eighteen years old?
How could Michael Mann's Miami Vice be a key inspiration for the original Vice City when it came out years after the game??
Do we think there will be lots more interior environments?
Why apartment purchase only online? All purchase should be in story mode also
What a time to be alive
The clip was freaking 1 minute long, how yall seeing almost a 100 Easter eggs????
Why do you think that it's not just a cinematically enhanced version of the game? There is no statement in the video (like they usually do) that everything you see is in-game.
I’m actually curious about the kids in the back of the thrill billy scene on the left. Is there gonna be kids in GTA6 or is it just a scene only thing?
The guns they use in the store in the final shot are interesting. the male guy's gun looks similar to GTA V's basic pistol, but Lucia's appears to have a Glock style gun. maying they remodeled the combat pistol from five to be a Glock?
So we’re gonna ignore the new jiggle physics?
Still can't sync lips Seriously?
If lucia is in jail does that mean if we get arrested we might have to go through a rehab thing if we wanna get out and has to face devier constituency if we break out ?
Im excited about the game but the next thing im excited about is where is the next gta game gonna take place at? Texas? (Since they already have the map model from rd2) Washington? Chicago?
How does that Damn Radio Tower Survive all those Damn Hurricanes? 🤔
Where are they getting this map from? Is this confirmed?
Why are you so quiet: GTA 6, strippers ,hooker's.......
All of that in depth analysis and you get alligators wrong?
Michael Mann’s Miami Vice (2006) was a key inspiration for the original Vice City (2002)? What?
Why all the ppl are black in this game ok we understand black life matters but its toi much
But isn't it render footage so details don't matter at all untile actual game play comes out ??
Why 69 when you can nine-one-nine? Man, I'm in love with GTA VI already, lol.
why aren't there more studios like rockstar? never plahed a bad rockstar gaem
Any news  about the crypto rumor that was floating around a couple months back?
Bonnie and Clyde type of story maybe? perhaps there will be split screen?
Who wishes that GTA 6 setting was set back to the 80s ?
How does IGN not know the male is Jason? “We don’t know his name”
13:50 are those kids in the background????
I've never heard the GTA universe refered to as the "HD Universe", where does that come from?
When does it GTA VI Arrive to PC?
And who’s looking forward to see if they incorporated the infamous “Faggio” to dip around the city with?
Where is the oppressor mark 2
is the map you guys keep showing official or a speculated mock up?
8:36 So you just ignored that Lambo?
When this game drops it’s gonna shut the world down
What do you mean we don't know his name, it's Jason!
Anyone found Vic Vance yet??? Tommy Vercetti???
Why is weasel news? Akin to Fox News? I’m just curious.
Who else was kind of underwhelmed by the trailer?   Don’t get me wrong, I’m buying the game. Just asking
Did anyone notice the dodge challenger police trooper ? 15:00
Who else cant wait to sink countless hours into this game!? 2025 cannot come fast enough!!!
Rumored Ps5 Pro will be out by 2025. Gta6 Ps5 Pro bundle $ony?
Why is it that I’m the only one that notices the children in the trailer lol.
