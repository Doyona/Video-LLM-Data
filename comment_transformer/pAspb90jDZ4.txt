what a fight! great ride of both
For God's sake can you guys stop spoiling the result in the thumbnail!!?
French booing at the finish was disgusting..Why did the Eurosport commentary team just ignore it as though it didn't happen?
WHY not SHOW the mistake that allowed Pidcock to catch up in the first place???

What a pity the wallie won...
