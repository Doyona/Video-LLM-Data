I had 3/6 legendary medals last season then I recently got legendary in br and MP ranked matches and it still hasn't changed to 5/6. Will it take next year to reflect?
I only have 3 medals how do I get six?
I got 7 is it possible to get more for this season?
Do you think if we could reach 9 times legendary at once,  can we get the legacy weapon?
Why didn't I get legendery medal while iam legendery 10000?
Any idea when the double cp event will return?
Could you make a video about the upcoming battlepass in the bp vault cause i wanna buy the train to nowhere but im not sure because there might be a better battlepass
