Eleven years on this single project!  Incredible.  Who else bzw what other company/organisation would invest 11 years in something.  Incredible.  I am probably too late to help with your questions, but most important is that it runs, so if more cars and longer races means more errors and the track overheating, use fewer cars and shorter races.  I wonder how long most visitors will spend watching a race, as there is not the same sort of thing riding on the result, i.e. visitors won't have as much invested in your races as the real thing. Maybe one thing you could do when this is running is have the MiWuLa scores and driver/manufacturer rankings displayed, so you can say that in 2024, Driver X won the MiWuLa championship.   Also, you wouldn't want every visitor to spend an hour at Monaco, or you'll have big traffic jams of visitors! Regarding Formula E - definitely.  But how will non-F1 fans know the difference between F1 and Formula E?
What a wonderful, complex work of technological art. I am awed!
When can we see the film in the streamings ?
Aren't those cars too big for HO scale?
