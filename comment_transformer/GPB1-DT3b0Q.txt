Why is Dan so obsessed on why Jordan is doing this NBC deal?? Its obvious that Jordan and NBC was the NBA for almost all of the 90s, he's done with ownership and is probably doing a favor to some friends he had there. Its not that hard to figure out Dan.
It’s going to take a cable subscription subscription to the NBA app and Amazon and I guess Peacock to catch all the games. It just seems like it’s gonna get very expensive and very complicated if you’d like to watch all the games??
Is Charles gonna crap on the league that’s made him for half the interview again? Let’s see
Doesn't Chuck realise that people would rather tune into Inside NBA without highlights during the game, rather than watch the actual NBA game? Majority of people tuned into Inside NBA because of 4 dudes talking about random things, not because they were showing post game highlights. Chuck himself was blasting majority of the games they were covering anyways.
Could this be a start to rekindling Jordan and Barkley's friendship?
Wait they not going to have highlights?
Charles is smart. The show is him and Shaq ... why lock into a 5 year deal?
Why is a Chuck wearing windshields
If the show is broadcasted on ESPN why can't they show NBA highlights?
What's with these ladies glasses that all these men are wearing now?
Can anyone be too honest? 😂😂😂 #stupidshi…
How did Kobe transcend the sport? Lebron, Mike, and Shaq were different. Even Steph is different. There was nothing about Kobe that was different. He was an imitator—facts over feelings.
According to news reports, TNT has the right to use NBA highlights and develop TV shows around them so why is CB saying they don´t?
Why does the round mound of rebound have ski goggles on?
I thought he said he was going to retire?
How wide are Chucks lenses? Geesh!! 🤣
Are Charles, Kenny, Ernie gna still do March Madness?
maybe ABC/ESPN will have them cover the Finals?
Why do the voices sound like they've been downtuned/slowed down?
