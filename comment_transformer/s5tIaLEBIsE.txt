What a play from scrum. This will go along way in the next decade. I was watching the play live , my mind was blown away. I was like, no waaaaaayy 😮
How is no one talking about koula scoring the game winning try by himself
What a try from DCE off the scrum!
Bout time the game goes our way. That's what happens when you aren't grubby and play fair. Manly deserved the win by far. That tommy talau "late shot" was an absolute joke. What has the NRL gotten to?
How good was it to see brooks and DCE combined to split the two biggest grubs in the game the 9-4 from the dogs lol 😂😂😂😂😂😆😆😆😆😆😆
How good is Andrew Johns.probably one of the best commentators in nrl history 🤗👌
Can Manly beat Roosters and then Storm to make it to the GF?
Nothing against bulldogs they dominated Manley the whole game but anyone else love seeing Crichton loose?
