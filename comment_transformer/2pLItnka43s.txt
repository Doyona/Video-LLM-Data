I am confused how they know to dance like this???
What is this kid doing in the dance class? Bo is doing the gritty in front of the front.
i take it non of their guardians are worried about these contents being watched by wrong people?
What did I just watch. I would've been disowned if i did that as a boy.💀
How he more flexible then the girl 🔥 young boy had the skill
How do they do that? That is so cool
Why is the boy dancing like that?
Sorry am I the only one that thinks this is inappropriate for children their age?
