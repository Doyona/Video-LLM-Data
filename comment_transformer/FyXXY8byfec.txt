It seems that the South African defender of the Cambodian (Kan Mo - "Mohammed Faeez Khan") national team is not eligible to play for the Cambodian national team, because he has not lived in Cambodia for 5 years, he started living in Cambodia at  the end of April 2020, so he will not be eligible to play for the Cambodian national team until the end of April 2024. According to FIFA Article 17, he is not eligible to play internationally for the Cambodian national team.  I wonder if the FAM of Malaysia will complain to FIFA?
