Is this only available in vinyl?
Who else is coming back again to get in the spirit in 2024.
Amazing duet Kelce boys!! Nice job to everyone involved in making this animated Christmas program!  Oscar award???
Why an awesome bunch of guys. Really enjoyed it.
how can everyone hate us so much with gems like these???? go birds!
Can Travis not get involved with literally everything?
Loved it! (Except you Dallas haha) But why was Nick Foles not listed in the credits?
How about a Hanukkah song thrown into the mix
Why am I crying!!?? Thank you special Philly peeps
We in Europe dont know why for 2 years they greet everyone but Dallas. What is a joke?
How has this only been seen by 28k? Awesome 🎉
I busted out laughing at the "except you Dallas" 😂 I gotta know who was hitting those high notes at the end!?
What a fun adorable show!! Not to mention these guys can really sing!❤🎉
Hey don’t Nick Foles get a credit? Or was that someone doing Nicks voice?
Was that really Nick Foles voice? He didnt make the credits!
Why can Jordon actually sing?!! I need to see him singing the next anthem at the game
So this year we got Travis. Next year are we getting Tswift?
Who knew that all we needed was Jordan Mailata singing all I want for christmas
How could you not love Jason?
Why do all of them have a lowkey good voice
Instead of Eskimo can it be replaced with Buffalo?
2:26 Taylor, what are you doing in their Christmas Special?????
When Jason Kelce said, except for you, Dallas, it got me😂😂😂😂😂
Are you kidding me!?! This is amazing!!!! Talent!!
Is Lane Johnson single? Asking for a friend 👀
How many times did you watch it?  Yes....if anyone can watch it just once I think there is something wrong with them and they should get themselves checked out by a cardiologist. Freaking adorable. I think Travis has competition on the show business thing at retirement, at the very least when it comes to voice overs and singing. Love Jason's rough voice.
can we get a whole movie? this is great.
how are they all so good? esp Lane sounds like an angel
How joyful well done - have a great Christmas from NZ
What a wonderful Christmas gift!!! Thank you to everyone involved, this actually made me laugh AND cry in seven minutes!!
NO DUMB QUESTIONS: When did you guys start this project? How long did they work on the stop animation? How long to get permission for the "Peanuts" animation style?
What a sweet end to Thanksgiving! Y’all nailed it! Great work!
How cute! This special warmed my heart. Thank you...and Go Birds!
How many people have watched this at least 3 times ? ✈️🦅✈️💚🎄🎤💚✨
Is this on Prime Video, please?! 😮.
Were they drinking Lagavulin at the end ? (I hope so!) Happy Holidays!
Who needs rudolf when u have Jason Kelce 😂
What a special treat to close out Thanksgiving (pun intended lol)!!!   Shoutout to everybody who was involved in putting this together for all of us Philly sports fans. The time & effort that this must’ve taken is incredible & I can’t thank y’all enough for this new yearly tradition for me & countless other Eagles fans’ to cherish for many holiday seasons to come. Go Birds!!!!
Can't wait. Are bobbleheads in the works?
