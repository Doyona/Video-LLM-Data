Who ever gassed Ethan up to think this is an acceptable hair cut and dye needs to be slapped by Will Smith
What JJ did guessing thing was basically "guessed wrong thing" so for example if he guesses vikk has lawyer role  and it is right vik gets killed mid meeting. Yes if he gets it right i.e and i played it times ago but you get two guess chances so after the 2nd wrong guess you're dead. It's madness even i can't fathom to handle it. And tbh there are mods where you whole lobby can have atleast 3 roles like 1 person will have 2 3 roles one being the main one. But i think that's total madness.
