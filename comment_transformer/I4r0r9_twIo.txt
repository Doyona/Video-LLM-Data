2:12 The way Ryan stares at him after Oliver says "we obviously get on" in reference to Buck and Eddie....do they know something we don't? Did Oliver indirectly spoil something??
So y'all telling mee there's not a single Wattpad stories of them??
We need a part 2!!!! Please!!!!!! What do we have to do?
Ig I'm just wondering how yall pick the tweets. Do you have categories of thirsty or something?
where is the puppy interview buzzfeed GIVE IT TO US
8:18  i am the only one that want to know what the tweet said ?
When you saw that Eddie and Tommy had a date to play basketball!👍
How many times have I watched this? Yes. 😂
My goodness. Can they just kiss already?
What is this Girl shit??? It kills the man vibe.
Ive been watching this video for like 2 weeks now and doesn't end... it is supposed to be this long?
why are these grown men flirting with each other like highschoolers and why am i giggling and kicking my feet like hello
Is it getting hot in here or what? Quick someone call 9-1-1 🥵🥵🤓
How is it that ryan and oliver have more views than a lot of these videos that's been posted a month and more ago? The power of buddie.
What Show Are They In Together?
Why is the english begging an American accent
Do they know that there are more comments that are about them 'together'?
How did I not know Oliver was english
Who else keeps coming back here to feel better after that season finale😔
Buzzfeed fell off, these interviews used to be fun.  They did NOT include one single thirst tweet, the tweets they choosed were boring and not thirsty at all… like bring us old good buzzfeed thirst tweets WHAT HAPPENED?
"they're best friends" have you no eyes,, did you not see that?
did abc purposefully make oliver the 9-1-1 spokesperson because they wanted a human shield to avoid criticism of that godawful finale? he's just an actor, the real problem is abc and the showrunners.
so buzzfeed when are you dropping the uncut and bts footage of this ???
Did he just say ‘that’s what they’re for’”? 😂 daaaaamnnnnn 😏
how long can you hold your breath??! excuse me SIR 😛😛😛
Did Joyce interview them? We need that asap if she did ❤
How much do you think Oliver weighs?
The thumbnail... THATS OOMF IN LAW???
6:53 so puppy interview with oliver stark when??
when a 10 minute buzzfeed video is more watchable than the entire 8th season.

Why is this 2 hrs long 😃
When will Peter Krause thirst tweets happen??
How does he not remember the fridge calendar? Bball with Tommy was CIRCLED
So… when is Oliver’s puppies interview??

Haven't watched a single second & I already know I'm about to feel REALLY uncomfortable!😂 The Internet has ZERO chill!🤦🏾‍♀️🤣 Here we go.......🤤🙈🔥  Update: Sooooooo BuzzFeed picked out the tamest tweets yeah? I know how the Internet works & this was FAR cleaner than I know is out there!🤣
How do you feel? Like I’ve been ran through. I’m sure he said more but “ran through” was really all I needed
Ryan guzman was in step up 4? Right?
why did they start blurring the tweet handles
What happened to the area around Oliver's left eye? Did he ever explain?
Did I internally scream when I saw this? Yes, yes I did
Where can we vote for a part 2 ? 😂😂😂. Cuz this was funny
How is this the only one of these that didn't feature the word "bussy"?
Can we have a part 2 or a puppie interview with them both again?
