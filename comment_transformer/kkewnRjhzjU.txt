Could we see the guy’s face?
What language does everyone speak on vacation? Not everyone knows the language of every country they go to I agree he shouldn’t have posted the video but every person in Quebec knows how to speak English
When I go to France they speak to me in English. I'm Portuguese.
When I visited Quebec (I'm an English South African), I did my absolute best to atleast try to speak French. I'd Google translate prior and often messed up. Most times my efforts were welcomed, but sometimes i was treated poorly. Now, I'm not blaming Quebecers for this negativity towards me, but English Canadians who have created this discourse by not even trying to speak their second language. Ive HAD to learn atleast communicable Afrikaans and Xhosa in my home country because there are large populations that speka those languages.
They speak France. Why don’t YOU speak French?
Why wouldn’t she just speak English? Montreal est une ville bilingue.
what is wrong with him in Canada we have 2 languages French and English but ppl doesn't understand in Quebec there is only one language and its "French" that ppl from France doesn't even understand. Le monde ne comprendrons jamais que le Quebec est EXTREMEMENT raciste.
Why does this matter? There people homeless, drug problems and high crime in this province.
Can we get this guys name?
