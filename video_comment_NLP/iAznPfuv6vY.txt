Now I'm kinda curious what these dishes taste like....If Botan ever opens her own restaurant would this be on her menu?
Can confirm, putting potato crisps in normal dishes turns them into Michelin star dishes
What adorable and tasty stream. Now really want to try all of them, and cute to see Su chan being so good with food. 🙂
