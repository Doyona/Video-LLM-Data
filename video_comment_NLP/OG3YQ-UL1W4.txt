Why are there now? Nigerian movies are doing a lot of cursing and sexual gestures The main reason why I wanted to support Nigerian movies because I was not seeing that and I didn’t have to worry about my conscious being disturbed  I’m a spiritual person who likes to watch movies, but do not to deal with the cursing and sexual gestures  I hope Nigerian movies don’t go that route

What an elder sees sitting down , you young ones will never see even if you climb an Iroko tree. Always listen to your parents first and decipher later. Who here read animal farm? The cat is an Amaka in this movie. Appearing when it's time for food and disappearing when it is time to work. 😂😂

How old how old were you when you realise that you can copy comments by tapping it 3 times
What an elderly person sees while lying down, a young person can never see it even if they climb an iroko tree. Dekunle messed it up 1:48:25
Is this movie about Adekunle Gold..?
Why would you tell your younger son to stay away from the eldest one without explaining to him the reason why. Tell him the reason you don't want him close to his own blood brother for Christ sake
My role model 🫂💯 My star boy  My crush  I love your movies so much  You are perfect    You were born for it my love      in what you do?

Who agrees with me that the scandals also contributed in him going more viral asides the music talent.. you know how PR works whether negative or positive.. but he's lucky everything turned around positively for him cos not everyone gets this lucky... This was a good watch 🎉,  Clinton is such a talented actor 👏   Weldone guys ❤
What the name of the last song please
Why can’t we download it
Guys was it worth the wait?
How can.you ask a full grown adult to stay away from his brother without giving him details. He is no longer a kid forghusake😢

Is this really Omoni Oboli’s channel?😊
May we see correct girl like shade not amaka😂😂
Guys? Please what's the name of the artist sang the songs Clinton Joshua is singing?
Why aren’t we talking about his voice
How does it make sense for the mother to hide everything about Bayo to Kunle and still ask him to keep away? These are brothers and its impossible to tell siblings to stay away from each other. The mum should have told Kunle everything so that he can be careful with his brother. But even with everything the brother is doing, you cant tell brothers to keep away from each other. Kunle would have understood if the mum had told him and he would have Kept his distance too but just telling him to stay away without a reason is strange... What if Bayo had used his brother for ritual?
When you read others comment my is even small ,
How come they installed CCTV in his rooms with his knowledge , who did that and how where they able to get through it without his notices , someone very close to him might be the victim , that is the answer
Didn't realise Clinton Joshua could fluently speak Yoruba o, wow! Also, the story line was on point and it obviously deserves million views in days just like Love in every word! kudos to you Omoni for bringing out the untapped potential from Clinton and the rest, kudos to you for a perfect job well done!
When he had nothing she's there and the one who didn't need him because he has nothing he fall for that fool why some of these man so fool shadae real woman but he trow away the best 👌
