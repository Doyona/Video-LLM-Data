Thank you for the subs! Maybe it is totally okay to film them separately alone on their travels for an hour or two. If they are highly introverted, alone time can be healing too. I empathise with Sang Yi who eats a lot. Maybe He needs to have rice, bread, ramen and fruits readily available. He needs to have snacks along the way?
can't wait to see the next episode ❤
