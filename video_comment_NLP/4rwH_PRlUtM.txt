How is that a professional goalkeeper
Is this even a football team they are playing against? I have seen street footballers play better then this.
Why does the play by play guy scream out the Devil 😈 name so much?😂😂😂
Has been practising his free kicks. All he needs to do is get it over the wall I suppose
Can Someone please Translate the speaker He is the best
What is he saying in free kick taking
Are there any fans in that stadium? Looks well empty
How old is he? 29 ? Congrats CR..  Eventhough i no longer trully enjoy football with what happen in Palestine..where satanic evil run amock on.earth, killing humanity..
Can we all agree that cr7 is the most greatest personality in the history of football.
the keeper couldnt have been payed right?
may Allah guide him to his born religion
Can anyone tell me what ronaldo said before 2nd free kick???

Is that ronaldo came by time machine. Cr7 2010

Very rubbish keeping. Nonsense  Why won't he score 4?

How on earth can anyone dispute this man's capacity and capabilities. GOAT
Did fifa count this goals ?  I don’t think so coz of it is piece of cake to score in camels league😂😂😂
How I love to see him score... I love ❤️ you Cristiano. Rhe greatest of all time. 🐐
Is this man truly 39 years. Am not sure. He most be 29 years old
How the player on the bench scary coach in 5th goal😂😂😂
Did you all remember the third goal by Ronaldo just like the goal he score in Real Madrid 🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐
And how old is this man again?
where r the haters who think mls have more potentiall
When Cristiano Ronaldo retires, it will be the last episode of football.....⚽
What is this goalkeeper even doing here? It looks like he had no intention to save those freekicks at all. This looks like a fix and it's really bad for football. He couldn't even win them the league, now it looks like they are trying their best to let him statepad. This is why he came to this league after being rejected by almost all ucl playing clubs and his own club.
