Why one tamil serial, cannot be happy family.
Where ventkathadesh put next drama with his family to make  shanmuga and bharani believe but rathna won't believe because ventkathadesh put acting to get back rathna to take over the school in his control again where all this plan ventkathadesh with his family again where ventkathadesh never change forever just act like become good in front everyone to get back rathna
This psycho ventakesh wants to avenge this ratna for no reason, well actually, ratna is the main reason for ventakesh to be changed like this, she is the one who chose ventakesh, as he life partner, and she wants to get married to him. But after her mother's death, she started to blame her marriage and started to show unwanted attitudes to ventakesh and his family, his we all can understand her feelings too, but she should have explained that to his family and him, and at least she should also  have understood their problems too. But she doesn't even care for him or his family and after that she just stays with her brother and doesn't want to go back to her husband. At least she should have gone to their house and stayed then explained that will make more sense,instead stayed with her brother and without showing unwanted attitudes and ego  towards ventakesh and his family, then ventakesh would still support her and would never change like this. But ratna unnecessary attitudes and disrespect towards him and his family change them like this. when it comes to shanmugam, he doesn't have any patience at all, he only seeing ventakesh changed like this, but he is not thinking why ventakesh changed like this, and who is behind ventakesh changed in character? He doesn't stay calm and take decisions, he just gets angry quickly and beats everyone up and that makes them even more angry. So both ratna and shanmugam is also the main reason for ventakesh changed and bharani she should at least not interfere with this attitude ratna anymore but she is still getting involved in ratnas life. First, ratna needs to change her attitude towards everyone, great example is how she treating arivu in school, the way she blaming and not accepting arivu teaching way is the perfect example of her attitude and she thinks she is superior for everyone and needs to rule everyone. Shanmugam and his sisters say that they are seeing bharani and muthupandi as their own family, but bharani and muthupandi cannot involve or help anyone in their family, by thinking good only. Then shanmugam and his sisters will start to see bharani and muthupandi as their enemy. I think Shanmugam and his sister are selfish, and they are utilizing bharani and muthupandi for their own good, that's it. I don't why bharani is still staying in that house, who needs her in that house anymore, no one needs her, or no equality will be given to her, and her own husband doesn't respect or listen to her words, but listens to  his sisters words and care for his sister life but doesn't care for his wife and her life. What kind of joke is this?
Rathna should make a decision. Who is Bharani and Muthupandi to interfere in her life?
Did everyone forget that she nearly died? Logicless barani
Who wants Rathna to divorce venkatesh😅🖐️ Edit: Support us families 🫶🩷
