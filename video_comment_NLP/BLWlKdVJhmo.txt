When you deal drugs in Colombia, you get kidnapped from time to time 🇨🇴
As a Liverpool fan I was quiet disappointed because of how we did that game we need to do better if we want to win the league who agrees with me?
Is no1 else amazed by how that isn’t a pen on van dijk? I’m a Chelsea fan so no bias but that’s a pen all day, I honestly don’t understand the rules anymore
Why would Liverpool take the field in such a dreadful kit?  It's live on Sky. Millions around the world are watching. Have they no self-respect?
How can he even play a full match with his father kidnapped? It must be hard
What a fitting end to the game for Diaz, so deserved. Meanwhile I'm still trying to process that miss from Nunez
Liverpool drawing with a small town team… Manchester United would never draw with a small team. What’s going on Liverpool?
Nothing on VVD Mr Carragher ,He just lost the 50/50 no?
May Diaz's Father Be Returned Home Safe & Sound.
Did the Liverpool players struggle with luton pitch today?
what did it say on his shirt man how u gonna do him like that let him spread his message
How does darwin nunez do this. Missing sitters. Scorin worldies
I hate Liverpool let me just make that clear. But if City got a pen in the derby for the Højlind foul, how do Liverpool not get one for the challemge on Van Dijk?
Should have been five up after 60 mins but Liverpool's finishing not the best lately. Klopp maybe should have played 442 instead of 433 to give extra strength in the midfield. Good goal by Diaz - respect for what he is going through.
Why do Liverpool keep changing their uniform to these weird colours? Liverpool are known as red don’t change that
So thats not handball but Salibas from 1cm away is? What?
how dare you edit out his message for his father
Did anyone else see Salah’s reaction to Nunez miss 🤣🗿
Nunez has missed about 17 sitters this season, when is the media gonna notice??
Whats the difference between that foul on VVD and the foul on Rodri?
What a game for Luton could have easily won this game ❤
What a moment for diaz. I prey to God that his parents are safe. Definitely an emotional moment
why they dont buy a good striker and they keep nunez?
Was going to suggest unlucky Luton but Liverpool should of been much better in front of goal.    Luton are defensively better than the teams below them, they can maybe take hope from that.  Barkley plays his usual good game against Liverpool, Luton need more of that.  Liverpool still a couple short but should still be happy with the start.  Got to get Mac Allister out that six position.   It had to be Diaz.
Did Nunez put on last season's boots or something?
Who is number 8 for Liverpool? He should be playing for a pub team! Awful attitude
Can't believe people were comparing Nunez with Haaland :X
Can't even beat Luton Town. 🤣
Why Nunez is still playing for Liverpool? Is Klopp blind? 🤬🤬🤬
Why is it sky hates Luton ??? Were are a team trying to make it with no money … and doing the best we can …. Up the Luton … so proud of you lads
Spurs only had 10 men and beat Luton???
Should have started Diaz and Jota/Gakpo... let's call a spade a spade all you pro-Nunez fans he may have to be loaned out if he continues this performance!
How many more chances does Nunez want 🤔
Is it me or has salah stopped taking people on? He always looks to pass now .....
Why have they not shown the message on his shirt at the end?
Why is klopp obessessed with the league cup playing a full team against bournemouth instead of resting the first team players was stupid i rather play the young fellows the fixture list is crowded enough .
What is that liverpool away kit
Why dont Luton play like this every week?
Can somebody please tell me the difference between Hojlands grab of the city player last week where a pen was given and the grab on VVD is this game and nothing is given? EXACTLY THE SAME FOUL. 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🙄🙄🙄🙄
What was on Diaz's t-shirt
When Carra said “you can’t feel anything but absolute joy”… everyone except Liverpool fans disliked that
When Spurs won with 10 men in Luton, football fans were mocking them that they barely won, they are bad and that the bubble was going to burst, blah blah.. but when it happens to liverpool, suddenly Luton are considered the masters of defending 😂
What a performance from the hatters, Liverpool not clinical enough this match to end it quick but respect for Luton 👏
Who on earth designed Liverpool's away kit? Jesus
How Diaz can take to the pitch and play let alone score a goal to get his team a point is unreal, massive respect to that, klopp must have had a heart to heart with him , brilliant from a Newcastle fan 👏🏻
What did I see luton was about to win against Liverpool
What is wrong with Nunez..... Never seen a more inconsistent player one week a wonder strike the next miss of the season. Great fun to watch as a neutral but would be very concerned if I was a Liverpool fan.
What a shame LFC ... totally embar... salah schould be in championschip 3 years already
Is this their first meeting since that 3rd round FA Cup clash in 2006?
How hard is must have been for Diaz. Fair play to him. Wishing him all the best
Luton deserved a point but surely that's a penalty?
Can someone tell me why Liverpool got 8 minutes of stoppage time awarded? Seemed like overkill to me...
Had to pause it at the start just to appreciate the stadium 😂
Anyone know what the make of Rob Edwards' jacket is?
What was today a charity for the bottom half of the table! 😂
So if rodri being pulled down was a pen why not vvd?
everyones saying what diaz has gone through.. could someone explain????
What a point, so gutting to concede last minute. Onwards and upwards COYH
How can Luton not hold a lead for just the last two minutes. Goodness me.
Should have been 8 nil to Liverpool
How the hell has Liverpool only managed a draw against a Championship side pretty much
What a moment for Luis Diaz! With what he's been going through lately he had to save Liverpool tonight! Also a great point for Luton Town
