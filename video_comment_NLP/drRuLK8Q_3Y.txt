Can't believe how beautiful all the girls are in this group
Have been waiting for Almond Chocolate to be here 🥹
Why do I feel sad hear this song 😢😢😢
Why no W-inds 😭😭😭 first take
0:22, why is there a blur on her shoulder here lol?
When it was first released, Almond Chocolate immediately became my favorite ILLIT song. Love this version — it sounds magical.
THE FIRST TAKE you can`not buy new holder microphone is nice visual use ?
Can't wait to see you all this week in indonesia
who knew that my favorite song by ILLIT could be even more beautiful. I hope they release one of their albums with full acoustics like this!
Will 'Cherish My Love' ever be sung? 🥹
Can't ever skip their angelic vocals 🥺😭💌
why they all look same tho 🤔🧐
HOW MANY INTERNATIONAL FANS R HERE TO SUPPORT ILLIT 🎉🎉❤❤
Are they Japanese or Korean group?
Does wonhee have a throat infection or anything? Sound like she is not in the best condition
