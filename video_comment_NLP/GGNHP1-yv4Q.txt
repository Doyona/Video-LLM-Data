Ok sooo.....Grealish scores in the 81st minute to make it 3-2, and then Kulusevski scores in the 69th minute to make it 3-3. How is that possible? 😂 Did anyone else notice this?
Who is here after city won the prem this year?
How is it possible City getting robbed
When we play spurs its a banger
What the hell was the referee doing blowing the whistle when the ball was still going after continuation? I still don’t understand what he was trying to do. Horrible refereeing
8:35 Did the referee call Grealish offside or foul on Haaland?
What a bad and critical mistake by the referee at the end!  As for the one after that, the penalty not being given, well, hard to say, but I think it was the right call there.
No one talks bout the referee in this coments section? Really??
What a game, intense and exciting
Didn't know Triple H started commentating football. How nice is to hear his enthusiasm
After watching teams like City, Arsenal, Spurs, Brighton, Liverpool even Fulham I realise Man U is nowhere near a team. No method, no structure, no life in the team. Can’t put the finger on whose fault this is. That bunch of holidaymakers walking around the pitch or the Manager? But then all the Managers that came in can’t all be wrong, can you hey?
Why is it that Son did not pass the ball to Richalison in that last attack, passing to Kulu was not the best decision at all. That's why we were about to be buttered in the dying seconds
How can u make errors when u have VAR system???
This commentary was surely added afterwards, no?
Did anyone think about the awkward handshake between pep and ante....its like i know what you did there😂😂
Had we score few of those missed chances and those few that hit the bar gone in,this game wouldhv being a totally different game
when kulusewski scored the tiny table showed 69 th  minute but was the 90 th minute
This was an unreal game, but did anyone else get the vibe that the announcer was rooting for Man City?
can believe Håland missed that basicly open goal  Also, whats up with shooting for the stars, 3 meters above the goalpost :(
What a time to be alive. The ref really out-did himself on these one😂😂😂
What a fool of a referee awful dession at the end sack this fool .
Im very sceptical about ref decision at the end especially, didnt watch the game so, can someone provide objective context?
When we draw with certain teams, I consider it a lose.
What I hate about spurs here is their LGTBQ premium ultra Plus armband
What a game! These two teams are a credit to PL. City commentating also brilliant.
City's left side defender is short and can't defend... but scores occasionally. Does that make sense?
What happened to City? We play draw three last matches, what the f**k?
Can any one tell which channel highlights are these?
Why is he wearing gay armband if its not the gay month?
Where is the minute? No minute on the screen. Is that the game was continued after being stopped?
When Julian alveraz missed his shot I was so sad I'm a huge Julian Alveraz fan
Can't forget Mahrez come back last year
Sonny has a grudge against Man city??? Why is he so crazy??
What a beautiful match both teams are damn good ❤
What a shame 😡 This refree is just too useless to officiate a PL thriller like that.. City were robbed 🥺
when are we getting an inside city episode? it's been a while
