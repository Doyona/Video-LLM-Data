How could you listen to this woman commentating for 90 minutes- Christ that voice just hurts mybrain - hope this political correctness reverses soon or my days watching football on tv are over
What a game for Liverpool but if I wasn’t a Liverpool fan I’d think Chelsea vs Man Utd was more better
Why do we have women commentators for the men’s game? Totally ruins it
how were all of the goals absolute screamers for liverpool
Why were all the Liverpool goals absolutely class
What a way to score your first goal of the season for Mac Allister. An absolute rocket of a goal and a rollercoaster of a game!
Why did Trent's free kick count as an own goal from Leno?
What a win for Liverpool at Anfield with Trent Alexander Arnold scoring the winner
Anyone keep coming back to this?
Why do we have to endure this shrieking banshee?
How did Liverpool score all off those!?
Why are people saying his first goal was an Own Goal?
What a match for liverpool, scoring bangers
are the male commentators jobless now?
whos some kids commentating the game ???
No media coverage on it going through Allison's legs?
What a game dis was and i a liverpool fan and my fav player is mac allister darwin nunez gakpo or salah
How has that fourth goal stood shocking
What is this commentary? Absolutely horrendous!
Had to watch this with the volume down , the commentary was a bit screeched
Had to watch this muted because of those two.... it's insane.
WAS EVERY GOAL FROM LIVERPOOL A WORLDIE
Should have been a foul Liverpool 4th
Why did Adrián not play? This keeper is rubbish
WHAT IS THE LIVERPOOL KEEPER DOING
I lasted one minute, saw Harry the Welshman score a wonderful goal, but I could not listen to the commentary anymore???
What gets on my nerves is the disrespect of Endo from our fans and klopp, everytime I’ve seen him play we get a clean sheet or win the game, he’s so underrated.  We need to play him as our main dm and put macca higher up, this happened today and see how perfect they all jelled.
What a hit son, what a hit.
Am I the only one who thinks its a fould on the back post in the lead up to liverpools fourth?
How does this commentator continue to be employed?
I presume as it's the famous scouse victims, we're (Sky and BBC included) just going to ignore the blatant foul for Liverpool's 4th goal, right?
How can they take Trent free kick an OG ???
Why do female co commentators scream, it's time to turn off the TV.
Foul in the build up for the final goal. What is officiating?
Why are Fulham fans so quiet home and away
Am I the only person to have seen a foul in the Fulham box before Liverpool scored the winning goal?
How is that not a foul on the defender for the last goal? It's late and in the back.
Game of the season so far ?
Can we please stop the female commentating 🤦‍♂️
Was that not a push in the back for the last goal😮
Why are there two women commenting men's game ?
amazing goals from liverpool, but , what was the liverpool keeper doing????
Can we appreciate that Kelleher is not premier league quality and so not be our back up
Im so confused as to how the first goal was an own goal for Leno?
How was the free kick from Trent an own goal?
How Liverpool scored 4 screamers I’ll never know
Why was TAA's free kick classed as a Leno OG?
What a vision from Raul Giminez to assist Mac Allister stunner
Can't lie some shocking keeping from kelleher, needs to improve if he wants to be number 2 to allison
did trent play RB or CM this game ?
Whose idea was it to let women commentate on men’s football? She killed the game with her soft voice smh
Why is there a woman screeching over the highlights ?
anyone else get goosebumps at the end?
What a free kck by Trent COME ON LIVERPOOL
Anyone else have to mute the commentators ?
When your having a game of Fifa and your opponent wont stop scoring sweaty goals and you have had enough!!!
Have to turn the sound off as the shrill sound of the commentators voice goes straight through me! 😖 entertaining game though 👍
No one see a foul on Decordova-Reid before the Trent winning goal though? Great header clear and gets clobbered, or is VAR not allowed to give anything against Liverpool ever again?
Didn't show Nunez' miss. Funny that.
I can't stand this commentary how can people stand these dishwashers ?
What a fantastic match of the beautiful game
Are they serious giving first goal as an own goal !!!!
Is it true that TAA freekick goal was given as an own goal 🥅 what a disgrace
Who is this Liverpool keeper the worst goal keeper..if he plays then Liverpool are in big trouble
What can you do about four shots like those???
How was Arnold-Trents "winner" allowed when it was a clear foul by Tsimikas!! Terrible refereeing. Will this game be replayed with such a blatant decision going against Fulham, i`m waiting for the media outcry calling for a replay.
How was the first goal an og
So women get their own game and they get to take over commentary of the men's game too?   That voice is shrill at best. What is going on here?
Had to watch this on mute. Women commentating drives me mad.
How was Trent’s free kick given as an own goal 🤣🤣🤣
Are they seriously calling that an og
Was in the kop end for the game today, had the perfect angle for that Trent free kick 😍 and seeing that macallister ball fly in was special as well! YNWA
Why the 2 female commentators? They just don’t sound anywhere near as good as the male ones
What's the Liverpool keeper doing?
Does the commentator have to state the obvious so many times, she could do with a calming break now & then!
Why have fotmob labelled trents free kick as a leno own goal
Can anybody think of a game where one team scored so many spectacular goals?
how has the first goal been given as an own goal. Leno is nowhere near him and it hasnt hit his back and gone in
What a game Trent best rb in the world 🔥🔥🔥🙌🙌🙌🙌
Sky why wasn’t this on the tv and instead West Ham v palace was??
When the hell did Liverpool get Son?  & Fulham were unlucky🥶
How they didn’t give Trent the opener is criminal 🤨🙄😤
What a phenomenal game from Trent thats what we like to see and crazy goals today from Mac and the others 🔥
When Kelleher again wonders why he's the back up Goalie all he needs to do is watch these highlights
Can really tell when allison isnt in goal
Is the first ever top flight game to have two women commentating?
How on earth has that first goal been given as a Leno OG. I don’t understand 🤷🏼‍♂️
Why are two women commentating? They're so irritating
What a game wow then goals ❤YNWA!!!!
straight up foul after the header in the last goal. Where's the VAR now?
How on earth does Trent Alexander not get in the England team. Absolutely ridiculous the man is an unreal natural talent 🙌
How can people say Trent is bad he’s class and today proved that
Two female commentators on a men's Premier League game?
What a game of football that was 4 world class goals from Liverpool could have lost credit to Fulham played well today but this team have a never say die attitude not many teams could do that getting beat with 3 minutes to go to win Newcastle with 10 men this is a team that’s great to watch
How was that put as an own goal
How great would it be if the title race ends up being between Liverpool and Arsenal, 2 clubs who've gotten where they are currently, without oil money and without 115ffp charges against them. We can only hope.
What a match what a goals !
why is trents free kick classed as an own goal?
How can the first be a Leno OG??
Could they find commentators that sound more excited when goals go in
Why they got women commentating on mens game?
Can we have some make commentary please. Just men for once.
Am I the only one who can't stand female commentators?
What happens when our defence that usually has the best keeper in the world surely gets injured and his back up is leagues below the standard we have been custom too. Ali saves two of those easily
When we went behind I thought we was done my how wrong I was and glad I was but Liverpool as much as I love you do ya have to stress me out like that damn
What do people think about Silva commenting about Tsimikas "foul" on Reid for Pools 4th goal? Surely you'd say if that's a foul then it's also a foul by Reid on Tsimikas for Fulham's 3rd?
Who noticed that before TAA's goal went in (the last goal) he was already turning to celebrate. Dude trusts in his accuracy BIG TIME!
Was this a goal of the month compilation I clicked on by accident?
Why are there women commentating on games now??
All 4 goals ruined by femal commentary. Does anyone have the male commentary version please.?
What a rollercoaster of a game. Endo made a huge impact for the comeback and Trent was fantastic. Super happy for Mac Allister with the best goal of the lot
Had to watch that with the sound down
Why are their 2 women commentators
What a game, the quality of the goals was something else. Well done both teams for dishing up such a spectacle.
Some great goals. Am I the only one who noticed the blatant foul on the Fulham player as he was going to clear the ball with a header for the 4th Liverpool goal?
What a game. And with Horrid Henry and Perfect Peter on commentary to top it all off🔥.
Did they really have two women commentating this game?
What a wonderful comeback win✌️ Mentality Monster💪
Should have been a free out to Fulham for 4th Goal.. blatant push in back.
How was Liverpool's first goal called as an OG?  The keeper is nowhere near getting a touch on it!  That's Trent's goal 100%!  Kelleher at fault for first two Fulham goals (Allison saves those) and VVD should never be outjumped at the back post for the third.  Three ridiculous goals to give away, but the quality we have now in midfield won the day for us.  COYR!  YNWA!
2:30 how's that not a free out?
What the games today.  4:3 to Liverpool and 3:3 draw City and Spurs, but Man U will probably have more columns tomorrow in Daily Mail.
Can barely watch the highlights here with those commentators.  Can't imagine what 90 minutes would be like.
What incredible goals today's Liverpool players scored. I wish we had played like that from the beginning, but we got what we wanted. The Liverpool players showed enthusiasm and began pushing the other squad towards the end. This game made Alison's importance clear to us. And Trent is a true Liverpool legend—what a lovely boy, I genuinely like him. Ynwa❤
TAA very much! Brilliant ! Mo is creating the vital assists. Keep improving eh?
Was that two female commentators in one game. Jesus haha
How Trents first goal is not attributed to him is beyond me.
Why do we have 2 women’s commentators on a men’s premier league game. Bizarre.
Who run the world... girls, girls!! 😂
What a brilliant performance by both team's. Once again Trent scored the winner. I hope Liverpool doesn't let him go . This boy is a class player who scores goals and wins games.
How the hell can the premiere league take that 1st off trent ?? The goalie never touched the ball.
can we respect how hard fulham tried huge respect to them
Why can't we have male football commentators?  Just taking away the passion from our game. This game was amazing and the atmosphere was top level, but the commentators sound like drab AI drones.
What more is there to say about trent, just absolutely unreal. very happy with the win but the mistakes will be our undoing if they carry on, so sloppy giving the ball away on the first goal, nunez NEEDS to start putting these chances away, diaz has been great for us recently so i don't wanna be harsh but he was wasteful today. conceding 3 to fulham at anfield when they're not great defensively is poor. happy to get the win though.
Would have been a travesty had Fulham got anything from that game. Liverpool fully deserved all three points today.
Bosh, Amazing, Sick, Fantastic, what more do you want me to say?
What a game! Felt bad for Kelleher though!
Did you really expect tap ins when the classic predators have just dropped
Why  are there woman commentator.. Ruins the game..
How Trent’s free kick has been given as an own goal is beyond me!
Didn’t have this on TV just so you could have two female commentators on?
Is Allison injured ? Feel like score would’ve been less against Liverpool if Allison was playing or just giving other keeper a chance?
Is it just me who thinks Mo Salah is so consistant with goal contributions.
Have to watch this on mute.
What a game this was, had my adrenaline high the entire time (whilst playing fifa)
What a goal from Alexander- Arnold!!!!!😊😊😊
Conceding 3 at home to Fulham isn't something to be happy about... Maybe consider taking lessons from Eric Dier?
what frustrates me rn is that we should be level with city on points. that tottenham game has put us in a pickle. Kelleher needs to be given the BOD for this game hes played excellent when we've seen him on the pitch. trent has been mythical this season. endo getting the ropes, darwizzy needs to be used as a super sub, when ever he comes on as a sub he performs, overall good game score should have been 4-2 if the gk didn't make mistakes.
Can someone explain why the first goal was Keeper own goal..
Why do we need female commentator in men's game?
Had to turn the sound down….enough to make the ears bleed
Why have a commentator with no excitement
Are we just not gonna talk abt Darwin's hair 💀
What a game but that commentary is dreadful. Completely killed the hype of watching this. Get some proper commentators on.
What a goal from Mac allister
Why women commentary???? Let the man do their job
When is Allison back?  2 out of 3 conceded goals should have been saved by the GK.
I take it the male commentators were all busy??
What goals from Liverpool !!!😮 You need scorers like that if a team gonna have any chance of winning big things (trophies), not even a Liverpool fan.
How many 'hold my beer' goals do you want in 1 game? 😂
2 women commentators on a men's game. Are they there because they're good commentators? Or is it because broadcasters are forcing to have an X number of "diverse" commentators on games?
How on Earth was that a Leno own goal
How is the given that as a leno own goal
How did Trent not get awarded the first goal?
Who decided it was a good idea to let 2 female commentators do the game? 🤦‍♂️
What a great win but but are defence worrys me
How can they call that first goal a own    Goal
Who are the two prepubescent teen lads on commentary? Nice to see young lads getting a chance, even though it reminds me of when me and my friends at nine years old would replay games and do commentary on them. Good on these young lads.
Wow!! Best game today and NOT shown live on TV 📺 who made that decision??
What a match and credit Fulham they gave us a match! Great win! YNWA!
What a win by Liverpool  mentality of a team its tuned top notch fight till last minute all goals by Liverpool top class  and Trent recently is unbelievable great game congratulations to Klopp and Lads well done YNWA
Can anyone explain why Trents free kick was a Leno own goal?
can never count Liverpool out, they always come back
Will mo salah score his 200 goal at anfield it will be a shame if he didn't 4 goals today even not on the score sheet
Have to watch that with sound off with her horrible screaming commentary
Did this game have two female commentators?!
How was that trent strike an own goal didn’t see it touch anyone else
Will be very difficult to beat the Middle East this season but wins like this give them a chance
Can't believe they gave Trent's free kick as an OG. Absolute Ballocks that's a Trent goal
What a match, 4 Bangers From Liverpool
How good has Alexander arnold been class player
How did the first one go down as own goal
Couldn't have picked 2 worse commentators for game of the season.
How is that not a foul for the 4th goal😂😂
Has to be bad for your heart supporting this team.  Have to defend better.   Either way the high after the low is something else.  Unlucky Fulham.
what boring commentary for that MacAllister goal
Why was the first goal given as an OG?
Do they really have to use woman commentator? If they really use woman touch in football they can use it during match analyses after the game, which i never watch! But they use ex footballer then! I had to mute tv during the whole game Woman voice just doesnt go with football. It goes with tennis or volleyball but never heard a woman commentator for basketball game either.
How on earth has the 1st goal been given as an OG to Leno, give Trent his goal
HOW IS THAT AN OWN GOAL
What a game. Lovely goals from our boys. Playing ugly and winning games. That's what wins the prem LGE.
Arnold wasn't given the goal?
What a goal from macca!!🔥 Puskas worthy!
What A Game And Some Of Them Goals Wow. Well Done Liverpool From A West Ham Supporter x
How has arnold scored more goals than a cm in 1 game 😂❤❤
What a resilience, determination and courage by LFC players. Weldone.
What a mach unbelievable goals from liverpool and mac allister FIRST GOAL OF THE SEASON FOR LFC! And a stunning goal for its first goal and are defence was bad like what lfc_szn4274 said and I also agree with him because sheffield united are doing bad in this league so I think where defently beeting sheffield united like 3-0 or 4-0
How come when I look at the stats of the game I says the first goal was an open goal ??? Trent should have 2 clear goals there
Why does every presenter on male football seem to be female these days
How fickle.are LiVARpool fans. Quiet for most of the game when losing pathetic support. But then all noise when they score or winning.  Learn to support for the full match 💩
Why is there 2 women commenting?? ☕️
why do fulham fans barley celebrate when they score? shite fanbase
Would have loved to watch this but instead the only game of 4 live on sky was the mid table snooze fest West Ham vs palace. Thanks for the great coverage!
That Liverpool 4th goal, how was that not a free kick?
Had to mute the 2 people being paid to talk over the match as they are unqualified to commentate on men's football .  not 1 but 2 , talk about controlling the people !
Could not imagine the scene watching those Liverpool goals go in. One word sensational
Has there ever been 4 better goals by the same team in the same game?
What shocking defense. Liverpool cannot give easy goals away like that.
What a comeback 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Trent is so class we got back up even conceding goals with that goalkeeper doesn’t matter to us YWNA
Will be interesting to see how much is made of that blatant foul on Reid before the Trent winner. Clear barge in the back.  LiVARpool.
Had to turn the sound off to watch this. Fifth rate Alan Partridge-style commentary, but at least Sky ticked some boxes.
How can they have female commentators for that game, the commentary for them goals should be a lot better than it is .
what a game those goals was so special
Another struggling performance against a team we should be destroying, our defence needs a shake up some players need to be replaced, I'd have Phillips over Matip but he's on loan, keeper wasn't great either and how was Trents free kick an OG?
What strikes by the whole Liverpool squad today. Mac Allister being my favourite. West fight by fulham as well.  Klopp really said only bangers today 🌟
WHAT A GAME!!🤯🤯 Trent just be scoring for the sake of it
What a goal from mac allister, Liverpool winning the league
Why is Kelleher still at Liverpool!?
How is the fourth goal given, when there’s a foul on Reid? Too 6 bias again
What a game of footy, with some absolute worldy goals
What a strike from mac allister and from wataru endo too and of course trents 2 goals too
how did liverpool score four stunners
What is goiong on with Nunez?
Can someone tell me how that free kick was a leno og?
What a thrilling match! First thunderbolt goals for Macallister and for Endo! Credit to Fulham, they were very good and put up a good fight! Up the Reds! 😊
Is no one gonna talk about how good those Liverpool goals were... WOW!
Why am I listening to two 12 year old boys commentating on the mens game?
What a way to score your first Liverpool goal. That was sensational from Mac Allister. 🤯
Why have Sky condensed this down to under 3 minutes??? Give us more!!
What an absolutely brilliant game! Some goal of the season contenders as well! Brilliant advert for football
Why do we have 2 women commentating on this game? It really is getting ridiculous
Why do people hate Liverpool? I don't understand? 🤔
What a goal from Endo and TAA❤
What a game. Roller coaster of emotions. Still, it was a very poor performance from us despite getting the win. The defence was poor and the drop off from Alli to Kelleher is staggering. Need to be much more defensively resolute in the coming games to try and stay on the tails of City and Arsenal.
How is that not a foul for the last goal 😂🤣
Why did the give it to us last 😭
what a game what a bunch of goals. wow.
