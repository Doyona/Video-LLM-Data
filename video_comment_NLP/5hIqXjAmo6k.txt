Is it bad that I've watched this 7 times in a row?
I wonder how they felt inside that 🤣
Wind shear just above the ground ?
Do you have to be histarical 😮
The commentary is ...priceless!   I rewatch this regularly as much for the British commentator as for tge extraordinary footage. Someone please tell me who is the commentator. Is his name Jerry?
i thought this was at EGLL but were they landing on 09L or 27L? and where was it filmed from?
Why do they not cancel these flightsatvyhe start?they know what's the weather at the destination. Something need to happen for that?
😂 was the cameraman a passenger too?
Bottom dropped out... Maybe Wind Shear?
Does he need a wash cloth now?
tower, could you see if someone can bring me a new clean pair of britches before I depart this aircraft?
When I was passing by I’ve heard you screaming from the street! 😅
Anybody know the registration number of that jet??
Who knew London had bucking bronco 777 aircraft? 😂. Well they walked away and the plane was not damaged… okay just taxi in … phew 🤔
When a pilot decides that it's now or never, and has the skills in spite of the weather conditions😮, to pull it off.
A bit of over controlling from the copilot there, I think ?
Can you edit the ooh ooh ooh they are so annoying ?
Wind shear... From the left or maybe a powerful microbrust....  You just don't lose lift like that out of the blue.... Anyone know the field TAF or Metar for that day?
RyanAir: Hmmm...how can we top that?
How do I get Jerry’s comment as a ringtone,?😁
The news took this and used it. Did you get credit?
I wonder what caused that ?? Wake Vortex or Cross Wind Gust ?? Pilot was keeping left wing down and the wind paused for a few seconds??
Where are those anti seatbelt people now?
Do we have footage from inside?
Can you imagine what that would have felt like did they record it ?
Can't believe that wasn't a go around.
0:27 Never mind the crosswind landing , who was it that was indecently assaulting him and why didn’t he stop?
How does something this heavy get blown about like paper. Make you think.
ARE THAT USER RECORDED WAS SICK OR WHAT?.. ITS HARD TO HEAR IT... 😮😮😮REALLY... HOW OLD ARE YOU GOSH.....
Was it good for you Jerry?
how was that not a go around
Imagine texting someone and being interrupted by such substandard  piloting. Now really?
Was watching that live when it happened. Have to think that both pilots may have been in need of a few adult beverages after that one, and the passengers all in need of a change of underwear!
Would that be recorded as a hard landing by the black box?
Can't wait to hear what @blancolirio has to say about this.
What runway were the pilots using and what were the winds?
Who else has watched that a few times just for Jerry’s reaction 🤣🤣🤣🤣 “oh stop that!” like a carry on movie 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Great job BJTV ❤
Was captain asleep (sleep inertia)? TOGA!!
Was it the pilot being super aggressive with the controls? I see a massive nose down input.. Maybe caught off guard?
do not watch this with the sound muted ... you need the full "oooh-oh-oooh-ooooh-oohhh-oho-ooohh stop it" .... effect... to go with it .... 😀
Was watching in a cafe and so many stared at me as if I was doing a male version of When Harry Met Sally, thanks Jerry!
How many seats had to be replaced? The pucker factor is really real!!! Wow
Does anybody know why he gave the left input it looked like he was on track to have a decent landing. Was he trying to touch the left landing gear first as some pilots do?
how did didn't they do a go-around that was insane
Are you straight out of the monkey enclosure at chester zoo 😂
" Ooh, ooh , ughhh! " How was it for you ?
Was watching this live when it happened, crazy!
This is how AA always lands as I can recall my flights with them. Or has smth changed since 2016?
Insane landing. Just wonder how many fpm for that touchdown.?
When you nearly say hello to your backside.😀
Was a big bounce there... , wonder what it was like inside....
Should never let AI land a plane 😂
why does Heathrow seem to have so many of these?
OMG , that was scary 😶 I bet the passengers were shaken ! How did he get the nose down?
Home, warm, and dry; now, where's that triple seven clip?
What on this runway went wrong. My heart was pounding😮😮😮
How the hell did they get that down? 99% of other pilots will have given it the TOGA thrust and go around
Fly by wire help old chap ?
Can't believe I missed the show!!!!!!
