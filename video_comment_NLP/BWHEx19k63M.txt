Shooting foul at 9:55 where the refs at ? What are they looking at ? What are they doing ?
Do yall ever just want to tell the white guy to shut up 😂
how is every video the greatest game yall ever seen…
Can we be the first platform to not allow Defense to call a Timeout  @Next22Chapter
Can we get the "ABC's"  crew onna commentary i wanna hear how scotty feel about the games as they go sometimes ‼️
What a game on both ends! Hats off to both teams; they played phenomenal ball! See, this is the type of ball the public needs: no trash talk needed, just letting the game do the talking. Tough buckets on both ends, impeccable defense, albeit a few fouls here and there, but hey, they're playing their hearts out. THIS is a product that will attract the masses because true hoop fans love pure basketball. PLEASE invite these boys back!!!
Is there some sort of agreement to not utilize pick and rolls in order to more sensationalize the game?
What a grind, congrats BJ and Caleb 🔥
How slippy are these courts bro wtf
What a game. Almost everyone from Nola needs to come back or war zone time
“Are you excited to play with each other?” ayooo???

Why did they keep attacking Caleb in the post when it wasn’t working AT ALL?

Can I pay for this video? Take my money!!!
35:24 bro airballed and got the ball back ain't that a travel or something?
