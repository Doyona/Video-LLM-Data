Why did their garbage battery go bad after 3000 miles? Ferrari should have paid your bill for the other garage fixing it now that you proved it was the battery not your changing the exhaust!?!
Are you sure that you bought a car that was made on your enemy year?
What modification did you do to the car that flagged up the warranty problem?
2 1/2 weeks to check the battery?
Have you checked the fuse that’s connected to the positive battery cable. The errors your getting seems like it may have been that
Did they test -  EVERY WIRE, PLUG & FUSE?  EVERY WIRE, PLUG & FUSE?  EVERY WIRE, PLUG & FUSE?   you didn’t say??
Why haven't you put anything up
How is this my first time hearing of this godtier channel?
Crazy that Ferrari gives their customers bs, I understand if car is significantly modded which may effect warranty but a customer spends hundreds of thousands on your product and you dont try to help...where is the loyalty??
Why do you a drive? Buy a Porsche 🇩🇪
Can't put the warranty back to stock.
Is one of the things Ferraris are known for, just errors for now reason. Great machines but in the usual italian style they have problems
That’s still was very shitty from Ferrari, it was a battery and their own people couldn’t figure that out?
Did they reprogram the battery if they just installed it and not reprogram it this could be the problem!
what ever happened to the Ferrari????????, came searching to see if there was a conclusion and i missed it>
Are you going to do an update soon?
How did this actually pan out? Would love to see an update on what actually was wrong.
Did the (ECU) computer get replaced back in Monaco?
How about putting your original exhaust back on for a while, purely to rule that out as a problem and stop Ferrari bumming you.
Are we ever going to see content on this page ?
So what happened? I’m guessing you want to or already put it back to stock. Can we get an update?
Did they check all the wires and all the fuses? LOL
May want to add some more content to help pay for that ride.
Had the same issue with  my Peugeot lol, changed the battery drove for about 10 miles and the dash lit up like an Xmas tree,  reset the codes after everything checked everything cleared , then I would get an issues with the auto clutch not going into drive , checked everything clear codes again ,drive for a few days lights come on like Xmas tree again. Finally after a month of shit ,we changed the only thing that was different on the car from when it was running OK. And guess what everything was fine with another new battery had the car for another 6 months no issues.
Didn't know FERRARI was built by Land Rover. To me, it's shocking that someone didn't replace the battery as the FIRST thing to eliminate the most simple thing.
How funny it would be to take the battery back to Ferrari under warranty. Most batteries have 2 to 5 years warranty 😂😂😂. Great video bro 👍
Did they check every wire though
why did you buy a Ferrari?? Just figured it out! Classic shiny object syndrome. I have made that mistake also, but you are smarter than most people can see through bad watch dealers and watches, how could you get suckered into buying a Ferrari?
Wait a second, emzo said in the frist video the battery might be the issue right at the beginning, didn't he?
I think you forgot to say that they checked every wire, every connection, every fuse?
What is disturbing, is Ferrari didn't know how to diagnose a faulty battery! WTaF!
So the Ferrari dealership, supposed to be the best ressource if information, couldnt figure it was a battery issue 🤔. They mentioned you were out of warranty...like an excuse to charge you for things you didnt need or were they just incompetent??
Is the warranty void or not?
Why does Nico become French when he sees his car again 😂
Shouldn't the car know if the battery is low or wtf is wrong with it...
Where are the professional Engineers who can look at the data and work out it’s the battery and precisely why? It’s not good enough that all dealer just chop and change black boxes randomly in the hope that the problem goes away but have no understanding of why. In my experience, I’ve never come across a dealer who can sit at a desk and study the schematic,  wiring diagrams, look at the data and understand what is happening. Most are just grease monkeys  who just waste your time and money and charge you for their incompetence.
why wouldn't they just check the voltage on the battery??? surely that should be first port of call
so u have money  but decided to make a YT channel to make more money ?
Car may not be under warranty BUT the I bet the Battery IS UNDER Warranty!  Ah, customer service...a certain company could learn a thing or two. Magnet or suction cup mount for camera? Dash Cam?
What about alternator. Given new battery did help a bit it can very well be alternator giving out unstable voltage. Or not enough
what a story! Looking forward to seeing more of this channel!
Had a stilo 24v one, Fiat looked at it and the guy was Italian not one single thing wrong with it, they got all excited to see a 24v stilo. Anyway next thing every light on the dash, replaced the battery and boom fixed. Italian cars seem very sensitive to power shortages
What a shame for a legendary and giant company as Ferrari stopping your warranty cause second-part companies accessories are not finally the reason for your car and its their own genie battery. Ridiculous staff😤🤬😑
Do you get dizzy when you are on the phone
why would a brand new ferrari battery need replacing? As you still have problems I would not be happy with this at all!!! Get back to ferrari and demand a full shake down
could not happen to a nicer guy NOT LOUD MOUTH WASTE OF SPACE
I don’t know why anyone would ever buy a Ferrari??
What a nightmare, hope things get sorted soon!
Would definitely check the alternator. That’s probably the problem
But did you check every connection every fuse every wire?
Are those ash marks on you drivers window pillar.  Are you really smoking in a brand new Ferrari?
Is that fag ash up the side of the door? Ffs Nico don’t smoke in your 812!😂
I find it quite astounding that your disgusting blasphemy doesn't get bleeped out but the word "fucking" does..?
Why don't you like EVs?😂? They are so good for the planet😂😂😂
what i dont understand, if everybody said its the battery, why the novitech guys check the batery first??
Had the same problem with a ford transit The Ford dealer wanted to charge $10,000 AUD  And that was the battery!!! I love your content You are a top guy  Cheers
But did they check every wire, every fuse and every connection?
Why on earth wouldn’t you just return the car to stock, starting with the exhaust. If the errors go away and don’t return after a few weeks of removing a modification, you know what caused it. If it turns out to be the immobiliser, the dealership will need to remove it or replace it for you.
did they check every wire and every fuse and every plug? you never told us
Bro sell it, why keep going through that ?
Would never ever buy a Ferrari. This is one of dozens of stories of pure incompetence I’ve heard. Useless company
Had the same on my old Volvo in Norway - didn’t drive enough during lockdown, then the cold in Norway shagged the battery, then Christmas tree action😅🎄. Modern cars don’t work without juice and they don’t work in ways you wouldn’t expect - warning lights on, speedometer showing half the speed, brakes and steering not working properly. Good luck getting back to Ireland.
How a brand new supercar gets into  those sort of problems straight from factory? Ferarri has lost most of my credibility by now.
So there was nothing that load testing the battery would reveal?
What’s going on with your accent?! Are you Irish or American?
Had issues like that with my F12. Installed a Varta battery that has a 42month warranty. Trickle charger on 24/7. End of problems.
What a shite advertisement for Ferrari this car and these videos have been,yes its a beautiful looking car and will go like fuk when its all in good order,but to be shelling out 4 grand a month for constant problems with a new car is totally unacceptable,stressful stuff that you just dont need in your life,and how you going to get it out it now, everybody has seen the videos n know its fucked.just do an insurance job on it n move on mate 😂
Can you not just take the car back? They should take it back, right?
What’s aftermarket on the Ferrari?
Have you got a ghost immobilizer fitted to the vehicle, I reckon this is causing faults with the CAN network
What an absolute PITA!  My money is on a loose ground wire somewhere.  That can show itself intermittantly.  Bestbof luck!
Could of things, changing the battery solved your electrical problems for the moment, but later some issues returned. Couple of things.  Those cars need a trickle charger at night to keep the battery at 100%. Usually a CTek trickle charger will keep you ok. But your was driving for a while and then problems returned. That leading towards the alternator. Means your engine was running off the engine draining the new battery from the 100% charge to a lower charge.  Many times with things added to the car, the amps needed go up from stock. I would test the electrical system and see if your alternator is handling the current state of the car. A amps test will show if the alternator is pimping out 14-16 volts to keep the computers happy. Check that out, it's one thing less you have to look into.  A real good mechanic would look into that.  All the things you mentioned, most would do, unless they dig deeper. Good luck with it.
Did you say “ they went through every wire, every plug , every connection!” ?😂
So Novitec didn’t fix diddly dub?
Why don’t you ice out the car?
You didn't mention in the video, but did they check every wire, every fuse, and every connection?
Could be an alternator, if the alt is bad then it messes up the battery if not diagnosed early enough. You can swop the battery but if it doesnt charge properly it going to continue to cause issues. Had the same issue on my Jaguar xfs
What a humble guy love to see it. Love the videos nico
How is it that Ferrari in Monaco didn't test the battery in first place? - That's always the first action any tech is making when it comes to electronic issue! I'd rather search for the reason why the battery died and consider changing or upgrading the alternator for a bigger one.
I wonder if you need to spend more than £1M on Ferrari's before they cease telling customers to go f
Can't believe the battery wasn't the 1st thing that was checked! Kwik fit would've came up with that fix in an hour.
What a shit company. You pay gargantuan amounts of money for a car that doesn't work and you aren't allowed to fix yourself.
I was just about to put the Novitech exhaust on my 812 GTS.   This video has forced me to pause my decision.   The dealer said, exhausts were OK.   But apparently Ferrari has a different idea.   Did you do any mods other than the exhaust system?
What mods did you do to your car
Why wasn’t it installed by novitec in the first place?
F%ck the car...... Hows ya mom? i hope she's ok ?
I wonder if anyone actually did a PROPER diagnostic test on the battery? 🤔
Call me ignorant. But, you can actually finance a Ferrari?
When are you going to put down the horse & buy bull?
is it me or is this chap walking in circles just so damn annoying
What a legend Constantine from Brabus is 🤩
What happened to your added immobilizer????
Was the warranty affected by the aftermarket exhaust?
Why tf is there a tesla parked outside novitec
Have them swap the alternator. Obviously the car kills batteries over time and theres really only one part that can do that.
Why did no one check the basics of a car the battery? fuse, levels in the engine, and no one bothered to check the battery, that's bad.
£60 eurocarpart battery £400 Ferrari sticker over the top of it…….. but £3700 finance on the car?
What did Biggie Say ? More money , More Problems …
Hello Nico! Your Mom lives here in Finland? Do you speak any finnish?
I'm unclear on what Novitech did? What did they check?
Did they check every wire , every fuse and every connection ? i would check to make sure. Glad you're back on the road and happy .
I wonder if they checked every wire, every connection and every fuse...
Might be worth a try to bring the car back to stock and see if it behaves itself? When getting my jeep serviced, we put in 2 different aftermarket air filters and each time the jeep went into limp mode. So I got a genuine Mercedes air filter and it’s worked perfect ever since!  No rhyme or reason as to why the Bosch ones didn’t work, and maybe your Ferrari is kinda doing the same thing??   Great content mate, glad your mum is keeping better!
Ferrari don't deserve your praise, Novitec did their job for them. How many Teslas in the novitech carpark ?
Couldn't happen to a nicer person!
Could the battery having a parasidic drain? Which in turn could be damaging the battery? Maybe @Diagnosedan could help you
What a shame. Hope it gets sorted soon, and hope your mother is well again. Keep us posted. :)
I wonder if the issue will come back with this battery after some time?
Yeah, but did they check every wire, fuse and connection before replacing the battery?
i want to hear the outcome of nicos mother, is she ok? is she gettting better? whats the outcome?
Nico is finally showing his true weakness - blinded fealty to Ferrari? I guess Nico had millions expletives to burst out at Ferrari as he usually does to watch brands. But Ferrari with definitely blacklist his ass if he had done that. Guess everyone has their weakness of choice huh?
Did they check the wires tho ?
Ill buy a G-Shock if you have a decent one??
What a story sorry for your machine of choice I will never sell my Mustang now hope somebody can sort it out
Does it have a battery management system, that might be busted or the alternator. It looks like voltage issues. Typical high strung car stuff. Upgrade the alternator maybe.
Quite a journey, literally!  Maybe worth buying a code reader to see what shows up, maybe ask mat to ask Carly ?
Should not have discounted what the Tow Truck Driver told you and replaced the battery as he suggested? What could he possibly know? only sees broken down Italian cars daily, life lessons, thanks for sharing the adventure and the lesson
so what you’re saying is… they checked every wire, every connection and every fuse?
Too broke to pay the shutterstock subscription?
When I bought mine, I was told the two best days of your life would be a)When you buy it & b)When you sell it.... The statement rings true but you can't beat pushing that red button every morning and hear her come to life (hopefully)... Keep persisting, owning such a beast isn't easy but its worth it :)
Need to do some voltage monitoring as it looks like there's something not right with your electrical system.  Could be alternator realted or could be something else. Does the car have any sort of hybrid capacity, regen function etc?
What about the alternator I think is bad or going to die
What a rollercoaster of a video mate, I was so pleased for you mid way through. Sad to see the warning lights return but glad to see you arrive back safe and sound. Life is not linear, you have ups and downs. It's how you deal with the troughs that defines you
Are you still buying DDE's cop car?
Is it a Dutch thing to repeat and repeat what you said 1/2 a second ago?
How much did they pay you for this to shut up!!?
Did not the first guy who recovered the car ( the recovery guy ) say it was the battery , or are my mistaken , brilliant video's .
is the alternator charging the right volts/curent
Is it not possible that the alternator or voltage regulator is failing?
How the fuck are Ferrari still using batteries from a fucking Ford transit!!! WtAf! 😱
Can't see how you can still say how great Ferrari are when they shit on your warranty without even knowing what the issue was. Also doubt that Novitech would do all that for free for a customer who wasn't a YouTuber with over 1.6m+ subscribers who was just launching a car channel.
When Ferrari themselves cannot fix it, a German car tuner can fix it ;-)
Why don’t you find your first ever car and bring it back
Fuck the car.  How’s ya mum?
How is your mum doing? Look forward to your car channel 😊
#LoveNovitec what about a periodic Generator failure. so it cant charge the battery enough to be at the rightvolt and gives you periodic errors?
How poor is the editing of this video 🤔🤔
What a bunch of amateurs. The battery is the FIRST component to check, not the last. And everyone missed it! 😂🤦🏻‍♂️
How did myself and many others say "battery" Yet Ferrari themselves didnt twig And it took Novitec 3 weeks to diagnose.  :(  As for the continuing issues,, I wonder if the new battery is also faulty or is something in the electrical system killing the batteries
Let’s forget about the Ferrari for just a moment and switch to the most important; hoe is het nu met je moeder?
alternator possibly not keeping the battery charged?
Was excited for this next episode… dull. Yappa yappa yappa
Sounds like there’s a drain on the battery somewhere that’s making the ECU shit the bed… did you a third party immobiliser/ tracker fitted ?
could it be you have a lemon?
Do not lean on batteries with your clothing, they have acid in them. 🤔
Not sure if I missed it but did they check all the wiring, connectors and stuff?
