Did Roe really just throw a fit over not being able to take over a pan of chicken. The guy was literally cooking it for her and she flips out that she doesn't get to finish it.
4:10 does Chef Andi technically contaminate the food when she tastes it then shakes the excess back in the pan?
Is anyone else bothered by how close she has her face to the pan when she is basting the steak? That heat directly on her face is probably making her sweat all over the food, not to mention any spit that is coming out of her mouth when she is talking...
Where’s JP? What season is this?
Did she tast it and than did the spoon back in again ?
Who tf is Steve Blake? Certainly no celeb...
Couldn't help but laugh because i knew immediately after they started cooking he was gonna send something back to them because it was raw and start yelling about it 🤣

Did anybody else catch what I saw?????  Andy, (sous chef) tastes the rice,  then slapped the rest on the spoon BACK into the same pan!!! Did I see that right??? Even if it didn't have rice on the spoon, it still has saliva, right??? Shouldn't you taste then get a new spoon???
Why gordon so holding back...hes not mad like he used to be😂
Why does the voiceover sound like sonic but with a serious voice
4:12 did she just straight up taste and just smack everything back into the pan?
When they are interviewing for a spot on this show, they have to use the "F" word at least a hundred times before they even have a chance to be on the show.
3:47 Why did she say "It is tasteless, it's delicious"? Is lady high or something?
PENN?? WHAT are YOU doing here??
Why is Gordon’s forehead so red?
Any idea what music is used between 9:43 and 10:30? The pace of it is amazing
What  be so wrong about a little pepper on the salad? I would end up putting pepper on it anyway.
Is it just me or Chef Andi Fine AF!
Does it bother anyone else that they're not wearing gloves? I mean they are really hands on with the food.
Santos calling out someone for making a mistake: “Okay valid.”Santos after Chef Ramsay calling out a mistake: “I’m getting yelled at 😢.” Am I the only one who thinks Santos is really overrated?

How is this, Gordon still in business? Why is he putting his fingers on the customer food? The main reason I dont eat at places like that, how disgusting it is?
Season 13 the most forgettable season ever! Roe came back in 18 and I was like what season?
Why does Gordon Ramsey have to use filthy language? What’s wrong with him and others who use that language? They set a terrible example for others, especially young people  They should be ashamed of themselves
Whats the point with ramseys pen behind the ear?
4:07 she just tastes the food and drops back in the remains that her mouth 100% made contact with back in the pan?
Is it me or the “ceasar salad” its just lettuce with sauce?
What and who is the sous chefs people talking about in the comments ?
Why are they just staring at it instead of probing?
why does the narrator sound like roger craig smith
@4:11 did Andi just taste the food and use the same spoon to keep cooking with?
Was there rrally three, ramsey was manning the orders and line more than cooking. The sous did most of it. 2 beat 7
7:38 that smile at each other!  Would it be fine if I call them naughty rascals?
Why do transformers have mouths? Can’t they just produce audio from speakers?
4:10 Did she shake off the food on her spoon that she just put in her mouth back into the pan?
At 4:11 Chef Andy tastes her risotto and then knocks the rest of it off back into the pan after tasting. Am i crazy or does that seem like it was a mistake?
Who else thinks this is underrated?
how is gordon floating between 2 kitchens while cooking as well as keeping blue in check
4:11 so no one is questioning why she puts her mouth on the spoon then bangs the spoon on the saucepan causing the food she touched with her mouth to go back into the saucepan??
Why are the cooks dressed up like 2000s gangster.?
4:11 did she just tasted and then tapped the same spoon in the pan ????

Isn't this completely fake?   Everybody here seems to assume it isn't but I am not sure why.
Is this food wars live action?
Why does it seem Gordon is a alot more calm in s13 compared to s20 and up
Did Andy eat from the pan of the spoon and then tap it against the side of pan?!!  The risotto has Andy’s spit in it!!! (At the 4:07 mark)
Is the narrator the voice of Batman in Arkham Origins?? Sounds so familiar
I would like to talk to attorney matt murdock. Do you know when he will be available?
What a great Hell's Kitchen video!

What’s Omaha steak doing at Hells Kitchen? Eating someone else’s steak?

How does gordan ramsay not burn out?
At 4:10, Andi, tasted the food, then tap the food off her tasting spoon back in the pan.  And she's the dream team?

How can you mess up scallops
I wonder how he met Andy if she like applied randomly shes in charge of everything
one more point, at the end he said his team of 3 finished earlier than the team of 6. But thats because they do this as a profession. Imagine 3 world class golfers v 6 other decent golfers, how is it a surprise if the professionals win?
I know it’s for fun but I find it hard to believe the contestants didn’t know this was going to happen. Wouldn’t they have had to prep both kitchens by that point?
Does Chef Ramsay have a sunburn on his face??
Why did the chicken cross the kitchen? 'Cause it was raw.  😂

I’ll share mine rn  Will you share later?  ….nO?
I love when Chef Andy put her spoon in the cooking risotto to taste it, took a small bite then drummed her spoon on the risotto pan, throwing her uneaten bits back into the pan. How about berating one of your protoges  for this despicable food safety violation Chef Ramsey?
Anyone know what season this is?
Will you share yours with me? 👉👈. No.
What's the point of comparing 3 ALL STAR chefs beating 6 NOOBS?   Did anyone expect anything different?

4:10 Ooo girl don't you know better?
When he says 15 Michelin stars it can only be him or his mentor, only 2 people to have so many, I believe his mentor has close to 40
Not to break away from the show. But is that Rodger Craig Smith narrating the show?
Anybody else see Chef Andi make that booboo @4:11 ?
Did any take a bite and dump the leftover on the spoon back into the pan 4:14
Is there anymore uncut scenes that could be released?
Is sonic the hedgehog narrating or something I swear
4:11 did Chef Andy just do what I think she did?
Could you share? Yes. Share now? Will you share when you get yours? No.
