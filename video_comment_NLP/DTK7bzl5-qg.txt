What were they given at the end of the video?
Why are people complaining about his vocals, his vocals fits song.  Let's be real his vocals are better then  Kaarija's, Eleni's, Tamta's and much more. This is how song is meant to sang
I find it strange how he pronounces ''attacks'', anyone else?
Has this audience been sedated by Olly Alexander?
why can't people just enjoy rather than a sea of phones ??
What a mood Baby Lasagna brings to the stage...amazing. ❤ For me he is the winner, even if there is strong competition.  But if you look at the whole thing together: he wrote the song and lyrics himself, has recently become a singer, made the official video with his girlfriend and knows how to take the audience along in just 3 minutes and create a great atmosphere. 👍 For me, this is an artist who clearly deserves to win.🎉
What a pick me artist xD
Is that traditional clothes for men?
This outfit or the red vest one? Now im torn 😩 don't know which one i prefer. Which one you guys think he should wear at the contest?
What a performance. I'm in a trance. So I have to say that the difference between this song and all the other songs is that it lifts my spirits, I can dance, I can sing, I can go crazy. He is the only one like this this year. A real pleasure. Other songs are boring to me as soon as I don't need to listen to them again and put them on repeat. I put this one on non-stop, it's addictive, and it's always the only one on repeat. So that's the top. Too bad you didn't sing I'AM INSTAGRAM BOY. I'm waiting, waiting... Oh o o o I'm an Instagram guy🧑‍💻🧑‍💻🧑‍💻... Cool!!! The top of the tops!!!. I just loveee this song!!! 🐈😻❤️🧑‍💻🧑‍💻😘🐈😻❤️🧑‍💻🧑‍💻😘😘😘😘💯💯🔥🔥💥🐈🐈
This crowed is officially dead, deceased... how could be so quiet during this and Georgias performance?
Do you think he could've imagined, when his song was one of the reserve options for Dora 2024, that a few months later he'd be hearing his song sung back at him by huge crowds in Madrid and London? Life comes at you fast, and I hope he's enjoying the ride, no matter how he does in Malmö. Best wishes from NYC!
