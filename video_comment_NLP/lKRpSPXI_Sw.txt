What is that white racquet Opelka's using??? Did he give up on pro staff?
Is Djokovic wearing those Asics shoes?
did opelka switch racquets or just a different paint?
Why do players put their hands through their wet hair then shake hands?

How dare these clowns beat the big foe?😂😂😂
Can't wait for Sinner to make Mpetshi look like an average player 😆 No matter how you guys want to call it... Take away his serve and he's not even a top 50 player... Couldn't break against a handicapped Kyrgios who literally just returned on Tour...  And before you nerds are going to start hating: I hope he becomes world #1 at some point. I wish him nothing but the best.
Was Opelka injured for the past year? I have been wondering why he disappeared.
Why they look like teammates 4:17 😂
Opelka found his inspiration in Cast Away?
Djokovic H2H with Monfils is 20:0. How is that even possible?
why do tiafoe and mpetshi always wear the same clothes😂
