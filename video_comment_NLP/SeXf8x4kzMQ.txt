Does anyone know who made this wheelchair? This design looks perfect. I'm looking for one for my dog!
Where can i get a wheel chair like that for my dog
Does San Diego allow dogs to be off-leash in public areas?
How about keeping your dogs on leash’s🤷…one of em even has one on and you still let them go free!! If you cant have common courtesy for other people you shouldnt own a dog! Not everybody wants random dogs coming up to them
Does anyone know how the dog go bathroom with the wheelchair on and outside?
What I said I m speechless  u r such a gem thanku from the bottom of my heart
Does he need tennis shoes on his back feet? He is awesome. Prayers and kisses to baby dog boo❤❤❤❤
How much cuter does it get than a pup walking himself and dragging the leash along with his best buddy jogging behind him in his wheels. ❤
How very precious to this love all around🎉🎉🎉
How sweet.  But it is best not to have carpet in a home with a dog that had to drag its bottom on the floor.
How wonderful, I felt like crying with emotion seeing the little dog running 👍🏻💙🎉
What a wonderful doggie and you're so awesome doggo mommy to care for him.  Delightful clip.❤
How impressive u r a legend lady ❤❤without u this dog would have been euthanised has a better life & so so happy to go walking My Hat Goes Off too U!!
What a beautiful pup.  I had a pup who used a wheelchair....
Why can’t we be like them ? Not impossible, we can learn from our young kids that are born with a disability or are disabled at a young age 😍
What a beautiful family! What joy you all share is wonderful!!
why does one have a leash??
Does it not hurt their feet?
What a brave dog😢😢😢😢😢😢❤❤❤❤❤❤❤. Love u so much❤
What a wonderfull.sight to see. No animal should be written off.Just look what can be done. ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😂
Is it a girl because she is so happy and cute and I love her
Did I just see  a dog on wheels  that moves faster than I do?   Crazy 😂
How cool  doggie was happy and made me happy to see the pup get around so good with that dog chair
What a great feeling if one has kind heart
Why do the human owners of dogs (even cats) like to torture a "paralyzed" animal?? In this case a dog.decades ago when people (i.e. humans) had a pet dog that ended up like this they would have euthanized it to prevent needless suffering by the animal. Yes animals are accorded laws to prevent abuse which l think this video and others are a form of. Dogs & cats are pets not ones children that is just insane. Animals don't have "rights" as l said they are accorded protection under laws but not preventing a dog's suffering is akin to abuse
What a dog , nothing slows him down ! 😊
What love! Praise God for Persons like this😊 See how the other dog grabbed his leash ?😂
What a BEAUTIFUL Bunch of humans you are to take such good care and love love love pour more love than love into giving this beautiful soul, all that drive and excitement and love love love ❤🎉🎉😂👌👌🤌🤌❣️🙏❣️🔥💋
Has anyone watched it and not smiled?
Is there hopes that poor dogs disable like this will ever walk I pray to God that is possible they look very happy that's a blessing 😊
What a wondwfu video... Watching him race down the sidewalk with his pal is priceless!❤❤❤
May God bless you forever 🙏🙏🙏🙏 I love dogs. I have four!
Is there something that the hind legs could sit in?🫶🏽
What a beautiful little guy !..BLESS THIS HOME
Nice video. What kind of dog is the white one? Blue heeler with boarder collie?
What is with the white dog?   Mom just hands him his leash.  Does he walk himself??  Lol.  Adorable.
Why is the other dog carrying the leash in his mouth
What a Great  Mom ,Love This tremendously, you get Mom of the year in my Book.
What a heartfelt video. The love showing by this family is beautiful.   That dog is so excited and happy to be able to go outside and with his brother at home with him loves it too.  See these people are showing you that there is so much love and understanding by dogs and cats etc.  Thank you for sharing.  ❤🙏🏻
When they are happy we're happy too. God bless.
Great wheelchair!  Where's the leash?
What a big mind you have  u god 🙏🙏💗🙏💗🙏 god bless you
What   a  nice   thing   I  saw.  👍👍👍♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Can feel the sheer joy as he races down the street. ❤❤
Should the paws be held up so they don't drag?
WHAT A BEAUTIFUL “ MOMMY “ YOU ARE TO YOUR BABIES ❕❤️
Who does it build such a good new thing to help this dog. He is so happy to be free with this thing.
How sweet,got to burn off some energy!!!
When our dog did that we knew it had worms.
How beautiful all of you are ❤❤❤❤❤
What a beautiful fur baby! Who ever invented wheelchairs for animals are the best. They can still have a good life. What a lovely sight!
Can you give him like a sock or a protective brace for his Right back leg? It scrapes the ground very often when he uses the wheelchair.
What a wonderful thing to witness, Such a loving wonderful Doggy owner, Perhaps a great addition to your Doggy wheelchair Would be some booties for his rear paws so he doesn't scrape up his little toes.
Can easy to run with her gear💖💖💖
Should be on lead might runawsy
have seen this vid at least 4 times and it still makes me smile.
Do we have  this type  of love and care for animals  like  this  in Africa  hear almighty  have  mercy
What a beautiful person you are to love these dogs. He i s soooo Happy. ♥️♥️♥️♥️
How happy is the dog now when he can walk like other dog i love dog i woll also adppoted dogs and give them a good life ❤❤
What a good and ideal Fur momma you are ma'am. The pet deserved to be love by you. GOD BLESS YOU
May human learn from  thise film  .Do not give up
How merciful you are, good woman. I ask God to let you enter Paradise
"Your dog must be in a leash."  Technically it is,... Don't think there's any requirement on whats on the other end of leash?
Where to buy this kind of wheel chair for dog?
Glad the dog can experience movement but you can't let them run around on the street without the leash.      In your hand.  Understand?
What a Sweetheart and Beautiful Fella he is
Do you worry about his foot dragging on the ground?
why is the dog like that? Did he get a polio version of sickness for dogs when it was still a puppy?
How is letting your dogs run uncontrolled along road where cars can be backing out or pulling into their driveways. Seems kind of careless wirh safety wuth both the dogs and people driving who might swerve to avoid hitting the dog.
Leash. Your. Pets. Unless. At. A. Dog. Park. Hello????
How sweet is this the pure joy on that dog's face cuz he knows is going out for a walk. actually he runs😊❤❤❤❤❤
Where is this taken place at?? Just wondering because the dog is carrying his own leash running freely down the sidewalk and looks as if its normal practice
Could feel the joy in it's freedom❤❤❤
May God bless you and your sweet dog
May god bless both the kids and parents may u guys always be happy with always in great shape and healthy and may god bless u with bundles of joy forever may god bless u all ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Doesn't the dog need boots on to prevent grazing
May God bless u n ur fmly blessings 4rm d core of my heart ❤
Is this avaliable here.i have rescue dog  like that.i hope some day  can i buy that.for my rescue dog...
I love this video showing how adaptive our dogs are when the use of their legs becomes an issue! My other comment is,  why don't you put on the projective booties so the dog doesn't scrape or injure their back legs?
What if he gets under a car and won't be able to stop😬
Am I going to hell for laughing.?
She never did hang on to the other dog's leash, does she want two disabiled dogs?
It's great for the dog. But what about his paw dragging, won't it get sore?
Can see the happiness in the eyes ❤
Why the animals be eager Putting them in the house is stressing them out
Does it hurt him when his legs drag on the ground?
Is so beautiful 😍 🤩 👌 to watch again and again 😍 ❤️ 💕
Great owner for caring, but what's with the dog holding it's own leash?
How happy they can play outside good job who made this wheelchair
How happy he is! His happiness made my day.Lots of ❤❤❤❤
His paw is dragging…can’t be lifted higher so the dog doesn’t get hurt?
May God Bless Your'll with lots of Happiness and Good Health and Love.Thank You Very Much
What a great dog mommy you are! That boy is precious,
What a lovely doggy mummy X
Where do you find these “wheelchairs” for dogs? Thanking you in advance!
What he runs out on to the road she had no chain on him
How lovely for him to go on walks and runs and play❤❤ much love❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😊😊
What a wonderful video. Go, puppy, go!!!
Why am I crying  ? As the widow of a wheelchair bound husband ,  this video means the world to me ! ❤❤
Does he not need special boots so his paws don't get hurt on the concrete?
May all love which you gave to dog will be return to u with more happiness
Did anyone else think his butt was ITCHING when you first saw him dragging on rhe rug? 😅 Bless his heart ❤️
Why does the dog have thepurple leash
What an amazing idea! I am happy for the dog ❤
Love the video. Are leashes optional where you are?
What an Angel you are to undertake the responsibility of a handicap pooch. It's wonderful to see him running and still enjoying his life.He was ready for his attachment and took off like an ordinary pup would. May God's blessings prevail in your home. You are absolutely wonderful!
I was afraid you were going to let him run right onto the road and finish him off. He's so happy! He didn't get that way by running on that road, did he?
When my Rottweiler couldn’t leap up into the back of my SUV, he learned that I would grab his hind limbs and lift him up so that he could enter the compartment where he could safely accompany me to my/our destination. As he grew older, I acquired a lower vehicle where he could get in next to me for our trips. He loved being able to protect me no matter where our journey dictated. I miss him!
What a fantastic idea for that poor dog
When idiots allow their nasty dogs to run free and others have to move away 🤦🏽‍♂️ when will they learn…
Does his left back leg hurt are broke
May allah always keeps you happy (pet parent)
What a beautiful angel❤❤❤Happy  Puppy!😊
What a blessing.  They're unstoppable
May the Lord bless you, dear
Can u put shoes on the back legs please ❤
What about the peaple of Gaza who die daily and what about their desabled children who die of hunger 😢
Who ever came up with this idea is a certified genius I ❤️ it
It's good to be happy our pets get help. But let's not think they have same value as humans. How about dust mites that are injured, should we care about their health too? Cockroaches, ants, mice, etc. All have purposes. Pretty animals have purposes... All are good... Created for man but aren't humans, created in the image and likeness of God.  Atheists, etc: I'm smart, you're wrong.  Me: your views are provisional too. So how did you become right?
surly you could add some socks to keep the back legs from dragging on the ground?
what a wonderful aid to give them a great life is so heart-warming thankyou ❤❤
Anyone else laugh at the very beginning of the video and then felt guilty for laughing when you realized the puppy was paralyzed?
What a good person you are The dog still has a good life To the people who made these for dogs Well done 👏👏
What a joy to see the happiness in anticipation of the outing!! Would only suggest that adaption might include the raising of dog's hind legs clear of the ground.? Thank you so much for sharing. XX
Why are they running around with a leash but no one walking them? There's a busy road and other people???
When I see the joy on this dog's face, I have to question why  anyone would feel that the inability to use his hind legs would ever reduce the quality of his life. Good bless this family! 😍💕🐾
How precious❤❤😊😊I'm crying happy tears
What an amazing idea to bring fun and happiness to our pets who bring us so much happiness and joy with out a second thought!😊😊
What is this stuff coming out of my eyes?
How kind of you , god bless you all .
What a beautiful mama and baby.
What could have happened to his/her legs?
Couldn't help but to notice that road close by to that sidewalk. Probably the same road the dog got hit on in the first place. ha ha run free goldie! bam right in to traffic right after this
What a nice people.  God bless  all who helped  dog
What a beautiful life you've given your fur baby,God bless❤
Who else thought the dog was doing that butt scooting thing at first?
What a great  dog , zipping around in that
May GOD bless for giving this adorable dog a wheelchair, he was excited to use it, very happy and very proud!
How amazingly beautiful thank you for sharing your videos ✨😇🎚️❤️
That other dog just holds the leash in his mouth?? What?
How beautiful. Thank you for giving him this opportunity to love life ❤
why am i crying seeing the dog running with his bright face
What a great mom. Those are some happy dogs.
Who adopted these ❤❤ cute puppies are really great 👏🙏🙏 god bless them whole family 4ever ❤❤
Would it be unsafe to add a pouch for the legs? Or is them dangling along ideal?
How happy he is❤❤❤❤❤ God bless you
What good, beautiful doggies! 🐕‍🦺 🐶  I LOVE how the b& w dog seems to help its sibling.❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Did yoh make that wheelchair for your furbaby? It looks easy to make there is so many animals out there who would love one of those. So freaking awesome how easily your furbaby runs.
May God bless who created this wheelchair 🦽 and God bless you the owner of the dog 🐕 ❤❤❤❤
When you place a leash on your dog, you must hold the leash and stay in control so the dog does not get hit by a car coming out of a driveway, or get attacked by a territorial dog in the neighborhood. Those dogs could knock down an elderly person or a cyclist or cause an accident. Always remain in control of your dogs out in public.
what a seen brother. u r blessed with this dog sorry your lovely pets god bless you and your family members from india
How sweet is that!!!look at him go!!!yay..❤❤❤❤❤❤just made my day to see this! Thank you.beautful dogs❤❤❤❤❤❤
Who could not be happy watching this?
Did anyone else tear up at this. Beautiful!
The back foot rubs against the floor. Should the height be adjusted?
Can see the joys in her eyes😊😊😊
May god bless you for taking care of them
What about the brown racing stripes on the carpet?
What a sweet and kindhearted momma
How precious.  It makes me happy to see them happy. God bless them and you.❤
What a sweet wonderful dog owner! ❤️
Is he dragging his back feet? They will get all scraped up
Where did you find the wheelchair?? Have an old dog who needs one too!!
How utterly adorable . Thank you for sharing this . Its very much appreciated .
What an absolute sweetheart, she deserves that great life that she has now!
May the good Lord bless your heroic “road warrior”. I jus luv um. 🙏🏽❤️🥰💖🤙🏾
Why do people disobey laws. Your dogs could have run on road
Wonderful!  Thank you. Cause of the paralysis?
I wonderful family... I think that this is thing... Very important
Did the dogs legs break from running into traffic woth no leash?
Here I’m thinking he has an itchy butt like most dogs. Do they just drag their butt around like that?
I thought that dog had itchy ass, atleast pick out the worms???
How can I make a wheelchair like that?
Is it okay for the dog to drag it back legs on the ground like that or do you have to raise it up a little
Doesn't get much more heartwarming than that
WHERE THERE’S WILL THERE’S A WAAAAAAY YAAAH❤️THE ENTHUSIASM IN THIS AMAZING DOG IS NOT ONLY INFECTIOUS BUT HEARTWARMING TOO❤️LOVE FOR WALKS TRANSCENDS HIS DISABILITY❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ BLESS THE OWNERS FOR MAKING IT POSSIBLE FOR THE DOG TO ENJOY OUTDOORS N THE ENCOURAGEMENT🙏JUST LOVELY❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
WHAT A LOVELY FAMILY! GOD BLESSED!
What a beautiful thing you’ve done for this happy happy pup Good On You Young Lady be proud of yourself and keep smiling
What happens to the other dog ~ has leash but walking by self?  Or was it just momentarily?
Does she want two disabled dogs? Letting them run around on their own without a leash is bound to end up in an accident one day. Even if you think you're in full control of your dog, you have no idea what other people and animals will do.
Does his right rear paw that's dragging on the ground become abraided?
How cuuuute, lol. Dogs always be like this, so adorable. They hear the words "go outside" and their off to the front door. Haha
How nice of you . He is so happy.
When the doggo started to run free 🥹🥲
May god bless you, they are so special.
Did the dog grab his Leash and he’s walking himself . ❤
What a lucky dog and affectionate owner ❤❤❤❤
May the HOLY FAMILY bless your beautiful family!
What a wonderful person you are to love your dog so much you gave him wheels.  My sweet dad did that for his dachshund…made a little wooden platform with skateboard wheels  low level and rested his dog’s rump and hind legs on it, strapped to his little chest harness so he could get around….not as lively has your beautiful dog, but happy to be included in my Dad’s senior life even though he couldn’t walk anymore.  Just Like you, my father had a giant heart full of love to share.
How many worms did the dog leave behind?😅
That dog has a built in excuse for dragging its butt on the carpet. What about the rest of you guys who do it for fun apparently?
It's great! I'm just wondering, how does brake with the wheelchair?
Why doesn't this owner walk her dog with a leash? If she did that, she wouldn't be able to protect the dog from the car society.
Why is she not leeching them? That is irresponsible. All good until an accident happen and the dog’s life pays for it.
WHAT A BEAUTIFUL LIFE HE’S HAVING
Was having a really bad day until I just watched this clip!  I want to Thank y for the warm and fuzzies as well as my huge grin that's stuck on my face. One Happy family ❤
He's gonna wear that one paw in the right down to a nub. Is there a way to prop it up?
What a wonderful, heart warming, sight to see! The joy on his face 🤗   Is there any chance of a close up of the wheelchair, please. 🙏  I need to build one for my boy!  ✌️❤️
WHAT A BEAUTIFUL VIDEO  THSNKS FOR BEING SO GOOD  AND SO KIND TO YOUR DOGS 🐕 THEY LOOK SO HAPPY AND HEALTHY
what about other dogs and cars.. adorable.. but wonder if they should be with owner on leash for safety from other stray dogs., and cars, ect.
What a great dog owner , a vet would tell you we have to put it down
Did anyone know they have a doggie chiropractor 😮....I didn't until recently....IF ANY CHIROPRACTORS OUT THERE WANT TO TAKE UP HELPING OUT FUR BABIES....WE NEED YOU...dogs feel pain just like we do ❤
How can you not love that
Putting a leash on your dog then letting him run down the street?
I wonder if the back legs could go into a device like an elliptical and if that would help get the nerves and blood flowing to regain some function? Anyway, thank you for loving this doggo!
What a dog can give you , no human can !
What was the point of giving the other dog a leash?
Who ever invented the wheel chair your going straight  to heaven❤god bless and to the carers
Is there a sling to keep the toes off the ground? It looks like they are dragging the tops of their feet which isn't good.
What lovely people, giving that dog a happy life. God bless
How about making a little "basket" to keep his feet up off the ground.
Can the back legs be picked up as not drag on the ground? Looks like it can hurt. Thank you for your loving heart.
May God our creator bless you for that kind gesture I could see the unmeasurable excitement in that dog
May God not leave your good deeds unrewarded.
Should have a little half ramp for your 🐕 so there's no impact on the wheel assistance 😊
Aren’t his hind legs hitting the pavement?
Can anyone share the brand of that wheelchair please?   Its soooooo user friendly and solid
How can he stop? İt seems dangerous when he runs.
When our fur babies are excited, it's the be a thing on earth!  The simple things are all they want and need
why doesn't he wear it at home too?
Who else thought he was just scratching his bung hole on the ground 🤣
Yeah I see how the dog lost his legs, guess you haven't learned a lesson?
What a kind soul the owner and the dog have. Bless them all.
does he ever wear the wheels inside or is that too difficult bc of the furniture and stuff??
Where can I get that for my chihuahua puppy and my other grandmother’s chihuahua because they are both also paralyzed
I like this particular model. Does anyone know where 8 can locate it?
What a good boy and tanks for helping them
May I ask the purpose for of the leash?
What a lovely people dis r d people who make us feel good in dis world like at some place war going on and some didn't care about animals humans n nothing they care about themselves only
What amazes me is that even when the dog is in that condition it still got the reason to smile and be happy for real thanks to the one who made it the wheelchair
What a fantastic way to freedom !!! ❤️🦘
When  I was a Daycare teacher working with 2 year Olds they loved for me to read  the story Go, Dog Go!. Your  baby  said  I'm  gone!!.😊
The toes are dragging the ground. Why aren't they in a sling?
What is the point for the leash? I guess 4 the doggo 2 put it in his mouth. Bc hes gone
What a Fantastic Family 🤗🤗❤️ They are adorable and Fast 😄😄
If you put something to protect the back legs and that way he or she is not going to be dragging them?
Totally awesome,, I love it ❤❤❤  Where can I get one of those doggie wheels??
What an energy will come to your life.....🎉 You just blessed your home❤😊
didn't read the title so I was half laughing at the dog for doing such a funny walk at the beginning ... :/ but the pure joy of this dog makes me feel less bad about it glad those dogs have such a good owner
Could hold the other ones leash but I guess it doesn’t really matter there’s just no point in even giving the leash to it anyways
Love the wheelchair…is one of his back legs dragging on the concrete?
Doesn't it hurt the paws dragging them?
How to travel carrying a dog in flights give some idea plz
didn't see the title and just thought the dog liked doing this scrapping the butt was him being happy
How adorable.  My heart is so happy.  ❤
Why is that one dog just carrying a leash?🧐🧐🧐🧐
I think that wheelchair needs a safety check. Or are those wheels supposed to wobble that bad?
What a blessed dog to have such a loving family so he can run and the joy SHOWS. God bless you
When you feel the wind blowing through your fur!❤
Are there any wheels for pug?
How beautiful their friendship is. So lucky to be loved.❤
This is beautiful! Are you worried about the back legs dragging and getting a sore from the abrasive ground though?
Why am i also got too excited for him going out?? 🥰🥰🥰
What an amazing and loving Mom to these precious babies!!! It is so awesome to see how excited they are to go for their walk...which is really a run!!! The wheels help that little baby run like the wind!!!Thank you for the beautiful video!!!
When the freedom of the dogs super weds the peace of humans walking down the street
Why put the leash on you weren't going to hold them. Is that the reason why he needs the wheelchair
Can something be done to lift his back feet further off the ground? Maybe a little sling or something? It looks like his toes are scraping the ground 😢
What a beautiful heart you have to take care of this disabled dog.  He is so cute and just loves life.  Bless all of you!
I wonder... can you make an adjustment so his legs dont scrub the floor?  Good to see him so happy😊
Does is paw hit the pavement?
where is your cart from? the front harness is so much better than the one we have for our pup.  such cute dogs😊
How could human hurt these adorable and innocent babies 😢😢😢
What a sweetheart. Thank you for giving him the chance to be playful and independent ❤
Do them back paws need booties when walking outdoors?
What a beautiful dog mom…you are an angel ❤
Cute video but what good does the leash do if you don't hold it. What if an aggressive dog comes out of nowhere?
How cute they both are excited to go out for walks 😂😂❤
Doesn't the back paws get rubbed raw from dragging some?
How beautiful to see. DOGS ARE ANGELS, WITHOUT WINGS
What a beautiful thing. Thank you for being an amazing person.
Did the dog get hit by a car ???
Why do you not protect his feet.
What a treasure of a memory!! ❤❤❤
Wow, that was a stupid move; letting the dogs run away near traffic. You have a leash on your dog so why not use it or, is the decision up to your dog?
I have a dog that needs a wheelchair. Ours is difficult to put on. That one looks a Lot easier to put on. What kind of wheelchair do you have?
This is a good assistance. I would like to have one for my dog PLEASE where can i find it ?
Why did this upset me so bad. Ugg sucks being an empath
Can you get a handicap placard for that dog?
What a terrific video. So beautiful how she gets so excited to go outside and RUN!
What a sweet wonderful baby! My heart ! ❤
When a dog is so well trained they hold their own leash
What a sweet happy dog. You are marvelous to take such good care❤❤
May God always bless you two 💕
How amazing! You're doing a wanderfull job! His face as his running towards you is priceless ❤❤❤!
What a lovely mother you are. God bless you.
When you thought he wanted a walk but instead it was an ass race !
What a hero, no what beautiful HEROS! THANK you so much!!
What a wonderful invention, that dog is so happy ❤
What an amazing dog and family. Such angels do exist. 🐕🌹🐾 Blessed Be ⚘️
Did the dog hit the tree? They are cute, but you should guide them better so that no accidents happen.
His back right foot drags on the pavement... that's not good??
Should have a resting strap so them legs dont dangle n get caught...
What a wonderful invention! It gives the doggo freedom!
What an amazing survivor! Ty for being a hero! 😊
What a great device. Looks so easy to use!
What kind of dog is the black and white one? And kudos for contributing such a nice role in the handucapped dogs life!
What a sweet dog. Hugs baby. Your awesome. ❤
What a sweeie,your wonderful for making him happy.❤😊
So cute.❤  His back legs are dragging. Can they be harnesses as well or some booties for protection?
Could u please check his back legs r touching the floor  b careful pleaseeeeee
What a wonderful life you have given this beautiful fur baby. You are an awesome mama to these babies and I thank you for this wonderful life these babies enjoy. You can see how happy they are and so excited to be outside. Bless you and your babies, much love and plenty of hugs for you all. ❤❤❤❤❤❤😂😂😂😂😂😂
When you're dog rubs his rump on the carpet he may have a problem, good to check it out.
What a fantastic fabulous dog!!! Sooo full of energy and enthusiasm for life !!! Gorgeous!! We done everyone involved !!!
How completely adorable!!!! Great loving parents!
Did anyone notice that the dog is without a leash running on the street
His one foot seems like it doesn't work as well and catches the cement, it doesn't scrape his foot does it?
Can i just say thank you for being an awesome human being.
Where there’s a *wheel*, there’s a way! ❤️
What a wonderful video you are amazing for helping her have an amazing time she is full of joy and i hope GOD fills you with eternal blessings ❤
Why do you have leashes of you aren't going to use them
Who else thought the dog was scooching his booty because he had worms? ✋️😊😊😊 oops!
Why sre those wheels do loose?
How do dogs with wheelchairs do their business? We own a GS and we're seeing some signs.. And we're afraid that she'll be needing one in the near future. So I'm just curious. If anyone would be so nice as to explain it, thank you ❤
What an inspiration to all the other 2-legged creatures in the world!❤
Great pooches and obviously loved. Why not put the leash on before you leave the house though?
Should lift the back legs off the floor in the support they seem to be hitting the floor
What an absolute trooper and such a great lady not giving up on such a beautiful dog. 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
How does a rear paralyzed dog potty?
This is the most heartwarming, exciting ,fun cutest video I've ever seen . I hope they wait at the stop sign, or traffic light? Adorable! Lots of love. Owner you are a blessing to them both as they are to you?
What a bundle of love and energy !
Shouldn't you strap his back legs up so they don't get hurt and raw bring dragged along.
How ADORABLE. Blessings to you all.
This is great. Do his feet have to drag?
WHAT A DOLL YOU ARE!! ❤ TAKING CARE OF THOSE BEAUTIFUL BABIES AND GETTING JUST AS EXCITED AS THEM WHEN YOU SAY "READY"? YOU ARE A ❤ OF GOLD
What a shame when I fell to see how beautiful God has made LIFE ❤😂❤😂❤
What great parents the dogs have nothing but the best
His wheels are wobbly. Are they supposed to be that way? If not, can I donate to get him less wobbly ones?
Is it me or the dogs are going for a jog??
Can't get better than this vid.  God bless your love.
How sweet and cute.. innocent soul and lovely face and smile he has...may he will be blessed ever!
I notice his feet dragging some.  Might booties or a little sling help protect him??  What about his elimination needs??  What uf he has to go at 11:30 pm???
When I 1st seen it I thought the dog was scratching his back door then realised he needed a chair to get along fair play to for looking after the dog 👏🏻👏🏻
What an amazing family, humans and dogs❤
Way cool  Can there be something made for his back feet to lift them up????
Why is it so hard for abled bodied people to say “disabled”
What a wonderful life you give them ❤🐾🐾🐾🐾🐾👏👏👏
How do you keep them out of the street?
Do His Lil Back Paws hit the Pavement???
What are you thinking?  traffic? No control?  dead dogs alert
WHAT A GREAT PERSON AND BEAUTIFUL DOGS
Is there a way to bring the back legs higher so they don’t drag? His little feeties 🥺
How absolutely gorgeous to see such  excited dogs and look at them running ❤
How much happier could they be?! I think they have passed complete happiness on are on their way to to paying it forward to everyone who sees it and helps give another a chance at pure joy. ❤
What a cutie.❤ wouldn't a wider belly   padded area be better softer  so he isn't pinched? Foot booties? What a sweetie aww you can hear the joy they bring you too.
How come the dog can’t have the wheelchair at home. Like why not let your dog be able to be a normal dog all day. Instead of just for walks. Just curious. Not bashing you. Just wondered why.
Does his little feetsies get scraped at all!! He's having' too much fun!!
How does he do his business?
What are these for anyone i see allot of dogs in these
Why would you put your pet through that? Just be kind and put it down! People are selfish!
Was The dog Born like that or was he in a Accident im just asking because i dont know
Why is Your dog is like that?❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
How does the w/c assisted dog use the potty.. from a nurse.
Is his foot draggin? No need to spend on dog nail trimming upkeep 😂😂😂
What a wonderful way to start my day! Thank you! Kisses and hugs to all of you! ❤🥰😍🤗🤗🤗💋💞💖💝💘
What all the brown lines on your floor?
When good owner and good person go hand in hand! 😊
Does she want to get her dog hit by a car? Not even amusing.
What a beautiful dog and the running made me smile ❤
How dangerous to let the dogs in that busy street . They will be hit one day by a car
It's great you help dog with wheel chair etc. But WHY are you letting them run wild down  the sidewalk beside a BUSY STREET...what's your solution when something unexpectedly distracts them and they run into traffic chasing it? Seems dangerous to me. Am I missing something here???
Im guessing by the way you let your dogs run uncontrolled out in public that it needs the wheels because it was hit by a car?
May God bless your heart ma'am. It touches my heart how yu love him till the end😢
I can tell you love your dog dearly but what if a car was backing out of a driveway and had just completed their head-check when he suddenly ran behind them as they backed up?  Wouldn't it be safer to put the wheels on at the local school track?
Why do you just let them run off leash
Booties for back paws😢 ? Road burn?
Love the dogs being so excited to go outside- but what, exactly, is the point of putting the other dog on a leash that is just dragging behind him- and forcing the pedestrians to get out of the dog’s way as he races down the sidewalk?
What incredibly awesome wheelchair! During my 18 year old Husky Snickers, what ending up being, the last 2 weeks of his life, he lost the strength in his back legs. The vet didn’t have much he was able to do for us sadly (just because your dog is old doesn’t mean that they’re getting ready to die if they have a sudden change in health - you should definitely take your dog to the vet and see if there’s something that can be done - Snickers did have a mild bladder infection which antibiotics did seem to help with his mobility. It would have been a godsend to both my dog and myself to have been able to have a wheelchair to help. I used 2 excellent harnesses to help support his back weight plus help with mobility but at a cost to my bad joints. But I’d have done anything to help my best guy Snickers!
Do his lil feet drag on the concrete?
What a great place to live for everybody❤❤❤❤
What an amazing invention! And that doggo loves it!
Any chance we could get that dog some Skyway mags from the 80s?
IS THE DOG WALKING ITSELF THO???
Doesn't his legs dragging like that get raw from scraping the sidewalk?❤❤❤❤
Mom...do you really trust the traffic....and both of your guys??
So sweet. So happy. How do her toes not get scratched off from dragging?
Do they have a route they take everyday that is the same so you know pretty much  exactly where they are ?
Don’t those back feet need to be raised a bit?
What sweet pups living their best lives  Thanks to people like u
Why are they off leash though
poor baby 🐕       You r a good doggy mom !!    What happened to him ??
Where can I get one for my dog
What a great clip of two wonderful dogs with lovely owners.  And the dog doing "wheelies" so fast is amazing. Blessings.💞
Do his back paws need booties to keep them from dragging on the pavement?  In grass it would not hurt the paw, but concrete can. What a great dog Mom, that wheelchair is fantastic.  Gave the pup his joy and vitality back.  So cute when they go running together.   God bless this precious family.  Stay safe, watch out for cars and aggressive dogs.
How does he go outside to pee (etc)??? Can't do that with the cart. #1 probably, but not #2...🤔
