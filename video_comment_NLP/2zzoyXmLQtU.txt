Can we all just agree that pharita here looks like an actual princess 😩❤️🎀
hey did you guys see Rora laughing behind when ahyoen was singing ?
why is no one talking about Rami  she's just looking like a barbie doll 💝💝
2:01 her mic goes down, her mouth closes, but we can still hear the same voice...hmmm lip syncing??
I love them dont get me wrong, but whats the point of holding mics if we know they lipsync?
I like the trend of hand mics that there is in kpop lately. I feel like BABYMONSTER brought hand mics back?
Can't wait for ahyeon & rami solo
❤❤❤ Sooo Is Pharita Gonna Come Out GaeGay Or What???
Why they don’t use other type of mic?
Is no one talking of ahyeon fake highnote?
Why was this reposted? I dont get it
Why ain't nobody talking about Ruka anymore? Her outfit and stage presence 💝✨
HOW MANY AHYEON FANS ARE HERE?
Why does Ahyeon’s mouth already leave microphone but the sound still lasts?
I love BM, but at 3:04 was it a lag between the audio and the moment ahyeon mic was away?
What i say, ahyeon deserves more fans i mean look at her she all rounder, she can do everything her stage presence facial expressions so expensive
Can you stop letting ahyeon rap? She should just focus on singing, her rap voice is actually making the song less catchy
Can't help but watch it the thumbnail is so gorgeous
I'm so sorry I know every live performance by Baemon is so monumental that their voice sounds like studio ver. But am I the only one that think this live performance playback so loud?
Why is it, I can feel that they're tired. Not with by the moves but if you see their eyes.. I always watched their performance so I think I can say this. It's just my observation
how many international fans are here; 👇🏻👇🏻
Who vote for Babymonster will become the Queen of Kpop 🎉❤✋🏻
Kinda confused who was singing the chorus with Asa at 2:22  ???
0:36-0:38 definitely not a live performance, why they have to use hand mics though?
is it just me or Rora's dancing is just full of cuteness and grace?
Why same outfits from past days?
👇 how many international fans are here to support babymonster?
