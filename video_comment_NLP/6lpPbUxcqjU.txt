What's tiramisu, and am I missing out?
When I was little I thought tiramisu was Japanese just because it sound like Japanese...
How long would it take to eat a wheelbarrow of tiramisu? Assuming you’re using a tablespoon and the wheelbarrow is able to hold 4 cubic feet of tiramisu, and assuming the tablespoon is 1.5*1.8*0.2 inches (at the scoop), you’d need to eat 768 inches of tiramisu 3.24 inches at a time, dividing to about 238 scoops of tiramisu, rounded to account for the decimal. Assuming each scoop takes the same amount of time as in the video, about 5 seconds, plus 3 seconds to chew and swallow, you’d have to spend about 32 straight minutes of eating tiramisu nonstop. Tl;Dr you’d need 238 scoops and 32 minutes to eat the tiramisu out of a wheelbarrow, at least.
DO NOT USE THAT SPOON AND UES THIS SHOVEL🤌🤌🤌
