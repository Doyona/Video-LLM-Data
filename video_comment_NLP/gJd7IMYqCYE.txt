Is the game available for PC?
Can't lie I downloaded this game recently and honestly I am addicted to this game
What nice video for a character you can only get with money.
Can you upgrade the graphics something similar to clash of kings
What the..  The ad made me kill polar bears for meat to cook and sell to people and hire hunters! This is different ;-;
Who brings a knife to a gunfight?
Can you pay $500 a day… no? Then you will fall behind, even if you dump $20,000.
So this means there will be an upgraded Jerónimo?
is there rehab for this game coz i need it real bad
when they can't afford to buy that's why they only bark😂😅
