How tf did these overstayers get there boat back come on fisherys be more fkn ruthless otherwise your working for nothing
Hang on - why are the confiscated fish not being fed to the needing?
What I don't understand is why throw the fish back into the sea, doesn't Australia have state ran children or old people homes where the fish can be donated?😢😢😢
Which country is this?
Why can't the seized fish be donated  to a food shelter or charity? Such a waste if they're already dead
What is the difference between snapper vs scub or porgy?
