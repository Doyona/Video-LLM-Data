Am I the only one who thinks every instrument was too loud during "birds of a feather"? You can tell billie was struggling to match the volume of her voice to the band's volume and it all sounded kinda off. Wish they would've mixed it better cause the mixing was perfect for all the songs except for when it came to birds of a feather. Im sad they "ruined" such a beautiful song. Of course it still sounds amazing cause it's Billie but the instruments were way louder than her voice
Everyone talking about the way Finneas looks at Billie but can we talk about the way the pianist looks at her? That man is IN LOVE

I think Chappell Roan's Tiny Desk ruined me because it's so energetic and theatrical that this one (and most others I've watched since) seem so...boring? Underwhelming? No doubt Billie and her bro are very talented musicians, but doing a Tiny Desk like this requires just a little bit of pizzaz as well, and it's sorely lacking here. Maybe because she had to get up so early?
What mics are those pencils? Rode NTG1? Thanks!

How about wildflower?
Wow. BetterHelp? Really? Just the biggest letdown right there....
I was like how can they top Doechii?…. Now how can they top Billie?? They need Beyoncé on the next one 😂
Is not good or its me?
Omg I wasn’t ready for Billie AND finneas singing together like what?? 😫❤️‍🔥
Why is npr advertising better help now ?
How is she real 😭
tiny desk and vanity fair? thank youu billieeee!
Name a better sibling working duo? I’ll wait. They have so much respect for each other and work together and separately well.
Billie is genuinely a legend ❤  Edit: is it just me or does she kind of look like she’s “suffering” while performing THE GREATEST??? Like I’m not sure because I haven’t seen her perform it before😅
What's so special  about her voice? She basically whispers a little bit louder 😂😂😂
Last song is based on an upbeat version of bleeding love by leona Lewis is it not?
betterhelp??? this late in the year???
Ads in the MIDDLE OF A SONG??? Come on NPR, you’re better than that.
David Luiz playing drums now?
Billie have been to a party from puff daddy?😏🥵
Who's the awesome men in the back ?
Why is this not longer???
Is it only the npr staff that gets to be the audience?
IS THIS REAL?!?!?!?!?
Ads right in the middle of songs? Really, NPR?
All she does is whispers. Can she really sing?
Bro tiny desk has been on an insane run everytime I'm scrolling through youtube i gotta take a second look like wait they got who?!
She is amazing but was she tired or ill?
Really people are still doing "Better Help" sponsorships? It's common knowledge that their "therapists" do more harm then good
Where is the chilean flag??!
Is there a person getting a raise for this one?
how can two siblings be so GORGEOUS
Where did tiny desk come from?  It reminds me of MTV Unplugged back in the day. How do you get to go to one of these?! How awesome!
Why is this fool “playing” guitar and we hear a loop??
Is anyone else loooking for the little kitty that Chappel picked up?
She's lost weight right?
Why does Chappells wig look like a Devo hat??? Did they not leave the trashbag in?? Paging Doctor Sterling Tull, we need a wig inflation  stat!!! Lol.....
Can we get this bird of a feather version on Spotify ❤❤
Am I the only one who doesn’t see the hype with Billie? Her songs are so slow and boring
Is anyone else absolutely freaking out right now ?
What happened to her hoice? 😢
Loved it, but wildflower??????
Wait who’s in the Audience? Is it the crew?
She has scars right???
why is this npr soooo spontaneous? why don't they host it every week? pure magic
How can someone sound and look this beautiful?? 😅❤
Better help sponsorship? Oof
Who is this girl, and why is she sitting in Paco Amoroso's chair?
Is this the  things that doesn't allow phonesss??
who would win in a freestyle battle billie or girl in red
Is Finn playing an Orangewood rubber bridge? I love teles also.
is the rick moranis speaking in the beginning?
Why is Frank Ocean playing the bass??
WHY DID I NOT GET A WARNING???? NO ONE TOLD ME THIS LEGEND WAS PERFORMING???
Love Billie, but why no hyperlinks to each song? Doechii blew it out of the water. Idk? She had time stamps.
Is it normal if I cried after she sang I love you? 😭😭
why cant these be longer!?
Am I hallucinating or is she drinking sparkling water?😂
Which one is the "meow meow meow" song?
When was this tiny desk concert recorded?
How does one get into the audience for these? -she asks a little too late
IF I EVEN WAS?????
how well do you vet your sponsors?
does she show them?
How to be great? Be Billie and Finneas.
how is this woman real
Who is this diva??? ❤❤❤ THANK U GOD
Where’s the meow meow meow song?
Am I the only one that did not want finneas singing in this? no hate (I love and listen to his own songs)  just was looking forward to raw billie vocals and the best parts seem to have him harmonizing
so they just dropped this on my lunch break like that?!!!
How long til this gets to 10 million views?
Didnt she make one of these before??
why is finneas not playing the guitar live 😢
why her whole band drew lookalikes?
Did that NPR person get that raise yet? Sheesh 🤩
why are they dress up like a church band?
No Blue??? No bittersuite???? No chihiro??? She really skipped her best new songs for this, what a shaaaaame 😭😭😭
