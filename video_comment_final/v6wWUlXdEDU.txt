Guys...why am I crying?😢
I cry everytime I hear this song and my parents and friends are like"why are you crying?"  And I show them this sonf
Anyone crying in November 2025?
Anyone in October?❤😢
Wait, is this a NEW song?!!!
omg why did I cry when I listened this song?
How amazing it is that SEUNGMIN can convey all the necessary feelings and emotions in his songs. How does he manage to do this???
What did I say goodbye? 😢I love you Seungmin!
Who is cutting the onion???😢
Can someone tell me which album this is on because I can’t seem to find it at all. I need this in my music library!!!
When songs make you think of a sibling you will never see again... paul is resting in askes
IS NO ONE GONNA TALK ABOUT SEUNGMIN'S HEAVENLY VOCALS?!?!?!?
chan what are you feeling?
is it just me or does this sound different than when it first came out?
Do you think he regrets his decisions? He worries me so much.
