How come girls don't get to try all these yummy things? It's kinda cruel lol😂
I wonder why an American doesn’t open up a Texas barbecue over there and make a fortune
Curious observation, with all the cornbread you’ve had, has it not been suggested to eat it with butter and honey? The way we eat cornbread in our family (in Oregon) is out of the pan served warm with melted butter and honey. Otherwise it can be dry. Super good with chili in addition to BBQ.  (Side note: Clam chowder is also good with cornbread even though I do prefer it with Buttermilk biscuits or sour dough.)
I died at "are you lying?" "he's not lying"
Yo what in the bloody hell is "Year 9 or Year 7??? 😂😂😂

"Oh, you want it be more bland?" both boys, "Yeah." The most British thing I've ever heard.

Have any Brits tried smoking their meats in the UK? Seems like a great business venture waiting to be explored.

They don't have pickles in the UK?
Texas fold?? This is the first time this very old Texan ever heard of it. Might be tasty, though.
Which Texas restaurant did you get that brisket from?!!
Why some black kids have to share among three students, where as white kids only have two per group.  Tv you need to be more sensitive in this area
Is all the food in these videos made in the UK or do you take it back from the US and warm it up
Just curious - why didn't you serve the cornbread with some honey butter?
Why the kids always posh harry potter type bellends ???
“At what age can you legally move to America?”   “Are you lying?….he’s not lying”  “That’s lovely”  “My mouth is mesmerized”  😂😂😂  I feel you bro, I feel you

What type of corn bread did you fed them? The out of the box kind or the real sweet soft kind?
So are Brits raised from a young age to cover their mouth when chewing regardless of whether their mouth is open or closed? All these video's show people covering their mouths even when chewing? I suppose it's part of a cultural norm, whereas, in the USA, it's mainly reserved for situations where your mouth is full and you are trying to talk AND CHEW at the same time (so as not to show the contents of your mouth to whoever you are talking to). In many instances if there is something said and the chewing isn't really impacting the ability to understand what is being said, there is no need to cover the mouth as it simply causes what is being said from being intelligible .
3:51 wtf? These kids hv been seriously sheltered
Ollie, I noticed the Mammoth Mountain shirt! Is there a video of you guys there? My favorite place to snowboard!
why does Mack look like brad pitt in his prime?😭
Is it wrong that I'll from Texas and I've never had any of this food?😅

How the heck did you guys get Dexters Barbecue over to the UK.  Fly it over personally? 😂
What age can you legally move to America is crazy
How do they get all of that good over there for them to try? Not just this food but all the fast foods they try.
"Are you lying?"....."Your're not lying."
How many REAL BRIT kids were in this? Not how I remember things. Sure wouldn't say this has anything to do with Brit school kids
why do Brits have buck ass teeth like that 😂
How did yall get bbq over there?
My fave video! Did they tell the boys about meat sweats though?
Why are they eating the brisket with their utensils
They don’t BBQ meat in the UK or what?
Plain cornbread though? No butter? No honey or jelly? No jalapeno cornbread?
“Is he lying?” 🤔 ‘eats it’ “he’s not lying
I wonder if DoorDash would deliver Texas BBQ to South Carolina?
Cornbread is best with butter.  Was the 15% off discount the gift for the headmaster? That’s so cringe guys, yall should’ve got him a real gift.
Fold as in f-o-l-d?  Is there another one? lol
Why did you give them dry cornbread? It's supposed to be slathered in butter.
High schooler and nine years old ?
How do you mess up cornbread 😂😂😂😂
Are you lyin? ... He's not lyin.
Why are there never any female students in these videos?
I dont get how they have the food prepared fresh for the guests. Do they fly it over and re heat it?
What steak are you eating that the fat is chewy? 😂
Are the two blonde guys eating together twins?! I can’t tell hahaha
Are pickles not a thing in the UK?
Also…what have they been eating all their lives?
Just out of curiosity, logistically, how are you bringing authentic southern BBQ to students in the UK?  Did you bring a caterer from the states to make it locally?
where did you find proper BBQ in Britain to share with these guys?
Is that Dave, the captain of Dave?
Also, you can't help but wonder where Josh & Oliver got those Texas barbecue foods to England. Did they simply pack those foods up and brought them back with them?
How did they get brisket into Britain for these kids to taste?
Some of these kids are like 10. How are they in highschool?
Butter on the cornbread? If not that’s criminal
Where is the brisket from
Did i read that right ? High schoolers? I looked like that when i was 5th grade middle school
They get the meat sweats?😂
Why aren’t you putting butter and (maybe) honey on the cornbread?
Have they tried soul food? Give them soul food and have them slumped for the rest of the day 😂

I teared up watching this....why?

How can the world not use the internet and buy a smoker to make this themselves?
Can they try mexican food next like pozole, tamales, maybe something with nopales, and like mole or something that isnt your basic tacos. If they decide tacos at least like al pastor or barbacoa
@jolly I love your content! How do you guys get fresh food for the head master and students? I know BBQ can be made fresh, but I’m curious about the fast foods you’ve had them try.
Is flavor illegal in the UK
What do these kids eat for this stuff to be amazing to them because as a proud Texan this stuff is kind of normal
Do they not have pickles in England? Cuz I would die. Literally drink straight pickle juice atleast once a day
I wonder how he made the cornbread.
Where's the banana pudding?
Is that young Brad Pitt 😮
Where in London did they find this yummyness???
So are pickles not a thing in Britain?
May that kid find a truly delicious cornbread because idk what happened there 😂
No corn pudding for a side?? I’m curious if they’d like it.
Awh?! You’ve got to have cheddar jalapeño sweet cornbread.
How long was the nap they all took after this feast?? Lol
"A texas fold"? Fine Sir that's a brisket sandwich.
Do the kids get to take rest home to their parents???
Who wants to try British food guys!?........ guys?....... anyone?
Why does harry the 9 year old looks like a kid in monster house i think? Ahahah the gloomy one with baggy eyes
why do people continue to think breadcrumbs on mac and cheese is a thing?! it’s literally only a thing with select restaurants and pretentious places. normal southern style/bbq style mac and cheese just has a melted cheese top that’s browned. breadcrumbs are an unnecessary pretentious ingredient for 99 percent of americans.
Man, who made that corn bread?  Add butter and honey and it’s desert!
did you give the boys plain cornbread? What about spicy cornbread? with bits of pepper and corn in it, more substantial. Or sweet honey cornbread? Plain cornbread needs sweet butter/honey butter. Nah, if you want plain cornbread....you need to slather it in something. But their faces, yes, they enjoyed the BBQ.
Why exactly do they insists on still eating as if German planes are flying overhead…
Where are some green beans or greens that have a little juice with some pork flavor to sop up and enjoy that cornbread even more??
Where the vegans at?
Do the British not have pickles? I figured they were widespread.
na the question of " what age can you legally move to America?" made the video and it was only 12 secs in
Which bbq joint is it from
Have you introduced them to “meat sweats”?
How tf do you get Texas bbq to England?
What country are they in?
"Are you lying? He's not lying." They gone sleep good tonight 😂 😂 😂
have they tried mexican food? maybe from Peru?
How old are these young men? They look much younger than American highschoolers.
so why aren’t there any authentic BBQ joints in the UK? I’d rather us export this than McD’s.
Dry, plain cornbread?! Nah, jalapeño and honey butter!!
How in the world did you get this to the UK?
Korean Englishman season 2?
Where did you get the BBQ from? An American in London?  Flown over? Or a chef who lived in America?
3:50 DO THEY NOT HAVE PICKLES UP THERE???
How do they get them bbq though? Did someone from Texas bring their pit all the way to England??? JOLLY EXPLAIN
You gave them cornbread without corn in it?!
Am I the only one who thinks the icons in the corners for the foods look ai generated? If it’s not I’m sorry but it kinda looks like it
Will you guys at some point be trying Canadian food?
My question is where did they find such good BBQ in the UK?
How did they get meat from TX to the UK? Did they actually ship it and then it was heated up?
Are these British highschoolers in the USA or do you import the food or prepare the food for them?
How does it look so fresh?
I'm a bit confused about Mackie. Is he 19 or 9? he looks older than most 20 year olds I've seen
When is there an episode of these kids hitting the street of America to try food? Honest ratings. 😊❤
Did the black kids asked to be seated together, or is there some other reason for the segregation?
Curious, do you guys use sweet or non sweet corn bread?  I prefer the sweet stuff my self.
Did you make the cornbread juicy and corny or just bread with a light light hint of corn?
brits don’t eat pickles?
@jolly, how did you bring the BBQ? did you smoke them yourself?
Seafood boil next?? 😋😋
Honest question, do they ship the food (then reheat it) back to UK? Or do they make it there? Or how does this work?
What about nachos?
where is the butter and honey for the cornbread????
If you could introduce them to one more American dish after Texas BBQ, what would it be? Mac and cheese? Deep-dish pizza?
Why do they never have high school girls try things on here?
How did you mess cornbread up???
How is the food prepared? is it like flown in? or does someone make it there? Just curious
No pickles in the UK?
whoever did the music?? it's so funny ! great job on music
Finally America for the win! 🎉 🇺🇸 🎉 😂   But wait… are pickled cucumbers not commons in the UK. You’ve got pickled eggs, pickled cabbage, pickled onion, but not pickles 🥒?   Did I misunderstand?
I have always been curious how you all source the food? How do you maintain the quality and the consistency with the actual places' food?
That cornbread looked really dry did you put butter on it.  Ribs are so good, brisket is  3ven better?❤❤😂😂
What my burning question is: where in London did you source this food? Because I want some...I am willing to do some things...to get it.
Is this reverse colonization?
Why does it make us so happy to see people from other countries fall in love with our food? Ill never understand but I'm definitely here for it.
7:38 wait- are they twins???
why do they have such interesting vocabulary
Did bro go to smokey mos for that thumbnail
Are the one set of students twin brothers?
British Highschoolers go to America?
Can you bring back Korean subtitles, please?? 자막 해주세용…
Why does that one kid look like a young brad pitt
So who made the barbecue and where did they make it? I’m super curious. Also, did they use Mesquite wood? It’s not Texas BBQ if it’s not Mesquite I’ll die on that hill. A dumbass parents moved to California recently and they have to finish off their barbecue with Mesquite chips from a bag. My uncle went to Hawaii for vacation and put Mesquite wood in his suitcase for when he barbecued.
isn't this an upload
I wonder...is the food cooked there in the UK
Why do I remember watching a clip of this a few years ago
Soo the gift was a sponsorship ad?
okay but how do you get the food to them?!
As an American who loves BBQ, I was sad for the boys never having good brisket or ribs before.. isn't that child abuse?
Was the cornbread sweet?
Wait 7th grade is high school in the UK?
Have you done this with American kids and UK food? I love the flavor discovery  here
How did you get the food all the way over there?
Highschoolers?! They look like middle schoolers 😂
There must be a reason why you have the highschoolers separated by race, right?
how are those kids high schoolers lol they’re like 10
So brisket is the way it is cooked? Like you could have pork or lamb or beef brisket?
So d9 these kids ever age?
How do you get all that authentic food to England? Not just the bbq, but all the different food you give them?
Why didn't they take off their jackets?
Okay so if they're in Britain whose cooking the food?
Why are they so short
What is a Maccas?
Wait, do they not have pickles on the regular in the UK?
My question is how do they cook this in Europe? Do they have like people from America over there?
I'm American so could someone explain to me the pickles part?  Pickles are just pickled cucumbers here (using pickling cucumbers specifically don't use the wrong cucumber or it won't turn out good lol) but do they not have pickles in the UK or do you have a different kind? It just seemed like they hadn't had pickles before so I was curious.
When is joe reacting
But, seriously why do the beans have to go on the bread?
How are they getting the food there? Or do they have a chef in their country
Who made that cornbread?🧐
I wonder where they source this food. Like do they order it and have it shipped on a 12-16 hour flight? Or do they source ingredients and have someone with the know how make it?
I wonder if it was actually smoked with Hickory, Mesquite, Applewood or Pecan or was it just tasteless slow cooked meat? The wood makes all the difference.
Why not let the Girls Have a Go??
How are you getting this food to the UK freah?
Just curious...who provides the American food?
What a great video! Everyone so ready to try, even the things they know they might not like. And some FUNNY reactions here!  Question though, as one kid mentioned the beans weren't better than British baked beans - I've honestly never seen anything about real British baked beans outside of popping a can of Heinz and dumping it straight onto a plate. Can someone clarify if there's actually a more home-cooked way the Brits make their beans?
I need to know, was it sweet or salty cornbread? The difference is huge! If they didn't like the first one, give them the other one!
Do they not eat pickles in the uk?
why your friend with you seem always like a sociopath?
Have you thought of giving them foods from Maine? It's sad that the can't come to Maine aome of our specialists. I really thinkbthe teacher would have the time of his life.
Don't you have pickles in the UK?
Why are all your British high schoolers boys? Where are the girls? They also have taste buds and opinions!
Have them try butter, honey, or molasses on the cornbread next time
11:20 poor guy has been eating "sloppy" and "runny" mac & cheese his whole life?!?! 😂😂
How do they get it so fresh? Did a Texas BBQ pitmaster come to the UK?
How you gonna do this to the kids? You gave them something that they probably wont ever get to try again and will be chasing this flavor for the rest of their lives lol.
What do you mean your macaroni is runny😰 why is your macaroni wet?! Its not supposed to be moist😭💔
Highschooler? 7 and 9?
Why are they so professional
Some of those kids are HIGH SCHOOLERSS!!??  Edit: nvm
I wonder how the meat sweats went…
Is that brad pitt? 😮
Why do you two like school boys so much?  It's a little bit off-putting.
having watched a number of these videos, I'm wondering when they do actual school, or is this just all they do is sit around and eat american food?
why the freak do they have graduation music in here😭
How do they get the food to the UK so fresh?
wait why arent brit kids eating pickles??? is it not a huge thing over there?
So does someone get flown out to cook this texas style?
Do these kids not have the internet?
Correct me if I’m wrong but doesn’t real, Southern cornbread actually have bits of corn in it still?
Why is that “sweet tea” so bright did yall use the right tea bags?
I've been craving some texas bbq for a while, where did you guys get this bbq from?
You didn't give them some sweet cream butter for the cornbread?
Yall f'ed up the CORNBREAD?!?!!
How do they get the food to them fresh if it was made in America fast food wise
I love the videos with these kids and I sometimes show them to my Engludh language students here in Italy. However, I really liked Max and Theo, what happened to them?
How did you get the food back to the UK?  Glad they all loved it!
Has someone warned them about the meat sweats?
How is no one talking about the last one that was hilariously.
How can they not duplicate bbq there?! And so curious where they got the food from if it’s not common there.
Where's the female students? Why are they never in these videos? Y'all should have done sweet corn bread.
The way they immediately put the beans on the bread just have me shaking my head like why why are you putting it on bread?
As a cornbread lover, I need to know if you had them try normal cornbread or sweet cornbread?
Where was the creamed corn?
SO DID Y'ALL BRING THIS OVER FROM A SPECIFIC TX PLACE OR MAKE IT IN LONDON BUT BASED OFF TX BBQ?
How do you get BBQ from here in Texas to England and it still tastes like it’s supposed to?
Why is he brown
How exactly did you get the food to them?
How did you get it there?
But is bettah than big bowl o banana fish pea soup innit? Salivating just FINKING ABOUDIT
Between US and UK black people, who wins?
Do they bring a chef to Europe or do they come here? Lol
How do get the food?
How about girl students? Would they eat delicately or chow down?
Do you compensate these kids for basically making your video?
Do these kids go back to class after these? I'm from Texas and after a BBQ lunch, I am ready to pass the F out for 2 hours.
Where is the honey butter for the corn bread?
Now do you understand the obesity epidemic? Can you blame us?
Can we see some girls try these foods already?!
When the British go on "Holiday" is that the same thing we Americans call a "vacation"?  Probably a dumb question I know.
Don’t they have BBQ places in the UK ??  Why haven’t any Americans gone over and opened their own BBQ shacks ??  I hope some of these young, bright kids seek the idea of opening a BBQ in the UK or Europe.👏🇺🇸
Not even going to ask this as an asshole. But is there a reason behind white kids with whites, black with blacks? I’ve been a fan for years, and grew up very diverse. I’m just curious.
Do they not have pickles in England? What do you mean you’ve never had pickles? How do you get so excited over pickles? Is it, like, a rare delicacy?
Did you all hire a Texas barbecue chef to come over to England to cook this up?
What I wonder after all of these videos is what, if any, meal that the kids have had again since the shooting. Like, did they introduce the food to their parents, or go to a specialty restaurant?
Why do they all look and sound 3-4 years older than they actually are😂
Did y'all bring fresh ribs to the UK? How old was this food when they ate it?
How did the English conquer the world for spices and then just never use them?
There is supposed to be a garlic bread. Where was the butter on the cornbread? Why did you put the the baked beans on toast? That would make them taste awful. They aren't British beans.
Tommy….whats your response to this?  Texas brisket and burnt ends obliterate all
What restaurant is this from?
I’m confused on how they got this food??
How long does it take to bring a texas bbq to Britain
Where’s that bbq from please?😅just curious❤
Corn bread you just need honey to put on it now that’s lovely,  do you guys have honey?
Where was the potato salad?
How do you keep anyone in Great Britain after eating Texas 🍖barbecue
I wonder how many of them have stomach aches after from trying all our rich American food lol
Is this Africa?
I’m just wondering how bad food is in England? I’ve always heard it’s pretty bad and I get such a kick out of everyone from there trying food in United States.
Does anyone know how this works? Like is it flown in and reheated or does someone go over and make it there? Like is there a tax bbq joint in London?
5:45 your gift to the principle was to make him buy data with your discount code? 😅😂 you’re taking the piss
Why do that to the poor lads! They'll never be the same
Will you please let the girls get in on some of this?
Wait...are pickles not a thing in Britain?
Did they get the meat from gold belly?
Hmmm....is the School Master a MAGA supporter ? (Blue suit coat, white shirt, red tie)
What the hell do they eat over there?
Who makes this food for the boys?? Lol
HOW are these kids keeping their uniforms CLEAN???  By this time my clothes would look like a visual representation of the menu! 😮😜 Next:  Go south and bring in a Brazilian bbq! 👍😜👍
How do you even film these? Are these kids in Britain and you fly out the BBQ?
How do you guys get the food to Britain? Like Taco Bell and jolly-bee?
Did they fly these kids to texas? Or fly texans out to these lads and have them cook for the kids?
Who is preparing this food for the students? Are they physically in the UK or are they visiting the US and getting this food?
Pork ribs looked a little dry, tough, and meatless. The mac and the beans didn’t look that great either. Also where’s the dessert? No peach cobbler or banana puddin?
who cooked  the food!
So they took all that from from America to London ?? Because if not then it’s not real BBQ
Who made the food
Why are all the groups segregated?
Is that a Mammoth Mountain shirt?!? I've been riding there for 40 years. So cool to see you've brought that to the UK!
Have the tried cajun food? Might blow their minds :)
Where is the roll of paper towels? Never dinner napkins.
I wonder if any of the kids get nauseated later because they're eating spices they've never had.
I wonder how they are getting the kids to the fresh bbq or fresh bbq to the kids in England?
Have you seen the 2 guys Josh and Jase? They are also British. They have a YouTube page  and show their travels in the US trying American food.
Is he lying…oh he is not lying 😂😂😂😂😂
So how are you bringing them this authentic American food? Did yall bring an American cook or what?
what happened to the subtitles starting during the ad?
Are you lying? He's not lying!
Why do British high schoolers look like kindergarteners😭
Who messed up the cornbread for baby Boris?
When are you guys doing Jamaican/Carribean foods? I want to see the kids try some oxtails, jerk chicken, salt fish & ackee, and beef patties
Where's the fried pickles and fried okra?? come on now 😂
Have these children never eaten?
Where's the Texas toast?
Why are these videos so fun. Watching  there reaction is pricless
What do you mean the UK doesn’t have patience to wait 16 hrs.  We literally watch cricket for 5 days and perfectly fine with no result after all of that lol!
Are all British students boys?
Can you please try Saudi food? Big love from KSA😄🇸🇦
Not me sitting here in Texas eating grocery store sushi rolls for dinner, envying the heck out of these students!  Do you finally crush them with how much that tray of goodness usually runs?  Easily $25. 😢
Where's the butter or honey on the cornbread? I don't know anyone that eats cornbread by itself! lol Either you gotta dip it in some chili or slab some butter on that!
So what are these kids eating out in England??!
Never seen anyone eat baked beans with bread like that. Is that a British thing?
Is that sweet tea they are drinking?
What? No "smashing"? 😋
"why don't we have this in the UK?"  Because you steal other people's food instead of coming up with your own. And when you do, it's beans on toast. 💀
Does England not have pickles???
I just love this!!! Question: Did all (student body, like when they had Korean fried chicken)the kids get to try the BBQ?
I mean, do they even have butter on that cornbread?
Don’t they feed children in the UK?
You sure this was safe to film during the "heat wave" that's melting London? 🤣🤣
cool video, help me understand. is this a public school or a private school in the u.k?   they seem so proper.
There’s several variances of barbecue across the United States, It’s kind of like religion.  And you don’t always talk about it.  Was the cornbread, sweet or unsweet?  Also throw some butter on it.
Who made that cornbread 🤔  😂😂😂😂😂!?
Nah! Who made that Cornbread? 😂 They need to come and eat at my house.
But where’s the smoke ring on that brisket???
Do you not have pickles in the UK?????
How do they get it over there fresh enough not to be nasty?  I mean reheated is no where near as good as fresh.  Also you didn't give them anything to put on the cornbread,  I love butter and black raspberry jam but many do butter and honey.
How did you pull off Texas BBQ in Englad? Did you fly someone out there to smoke it?
How did you get it there!??
What happened to the Texas toast?
Do the teachers get to enjoy some this goodness?
Have they ever had Primantis Brothers aka a Pittsburgh sandwich?
"Are you lying?...He's not lying" 😆😆😆😆
where is the jalepeno!! js stuffed and bacon wrapped ... missed out on that one... lol maybe next time... but texas bbq is the best...
What kind of freak eats barbecue beans on bread?
How do the logistics work?  Do you order the food from America, then cook it???  I just LOVE YOUR  content!
great video How do/did you guys get that in England??
Are they all drinking Arnold Palmers?😂🤣
Do british people not eat pickles much?
Native Texan here. What the heck is a Texas Fold?
They sell Texas bbq in England? Hmmm
How do they get the food to the kids?
How do they even have fresh cooked brisket in England, do they even have a smoker on the country?
Maybe if they would have put a little bit of butter on the cornbread it would taste better ? 🤷
Is there segregation in the UK? How come the school children are always filmed according to the color of their skin?
Where do they get the food from? It looks really good but there's nothing that matches sitting down in Texas and eating it
Is there a market for BBQ in the UK?
Those pork ribs had nearly no meat on them?!
Are they cooking the food in the UK?
Why did they bite the sandwich in the middle?
Where did y’all get that legitimate BBQ in England?!
Seriously how do they not know.......?????
Do the Brits across the pond smoke meat often?
Are the kids segregated at that school?
I'm just trying to figure out how you got legitimate, real Texas barbecue in England. Do they even have the right equipment for that over there?
At least they can use big words!! Can we import the intelligence?
Is my family the only one's that add honey or sugar to the cornbread before we skillet bake it? It always comes out sweet and delicious.
How did they get it to the UK?
Was it hot water cornbread or that Jiffy? Was the tea super sweet(🤢) or just sun tea? Makes a difference.
All the things they are trying for the first time....what do they eat over there?all I ever hear is fish and French fries.
Did they give them Texas sweet (iced) tea, as well??
How about having the lads give chili a go?  Or some American casseroles like the ones you had in Michigan?  Or maybe see about taking them to one of the American bases on the 4th of July?
These are high school kids? They looks so young 😮
Did you fly over a pit master? Or fly OUT the bbq?
I've always wondered... Is there a reason they only make these videos with boys?
how do you get TX bbq in the UK for this video???
High schoolers??? Bruh like half of these look like 6th graders
Have they try some soul food
How do they get it over there looking so good or are they in texas?
Who the hell calls a brisket sandwhich "the Texas fold"
What's the deal with putting the beans on bread?  They just ruined the beans.
I wonder if any of them got the meat sweats. 😂
Ok so where did you get this from and where do I need to go??
Is that from Terry Black's, and how did you get it over? ❤️
Why do some of the supposed Brit’s look like Africans?
How do they do this?  Is the food fresh?
I enjoy watching very much, but I have to ask how you get the foods to the kids and have it be eatable and presentable?
They didnt give them sauce ?
I do wonder why the kids are filmed in groups based on complexion. Is that intentional or by chance? Now that it’s been a continuous thing with different people it does seem quite odd. Is this the norm in Britain?
So do brits literally not use seasonings or anything?
Everything looked great, but wtf was that cornbread?? Y’all just use jiffy, or what?
Do yall have someone make the fresh foods for the people?
Lots of non white british ……… how? Failed UK policy
You do know that the kids are actors, right? How can they give them American food without being here? Once I saw them get handed a wrapper with a burger from Wendy’s. That must have been 24 hours old in the best of circumstances.
What the heck do British people usually eat? I would probably have to live off of fish and chips if i went there.
Whyt Europeans put food together that don't make any sense same here in America like bake beans and toast?
Why are the black kids always segregated?
Why exactly are the students segregated? It seems the food is a common experience for them.
What do they eat in the Britain if they’ve never had any of these foods?!
wait....WHAT!?!?! are pickles not a thing in england?
Why are these videos so entertaining
Where did you get Texas BBQ I Britain?
Can we get these kids (and the hosts by surprise) on a massively reduced spicyness version of HotOnes? @HotOnes @Jolly collab?
Hey! The headmaster looks different. What has changed?
What do you feed these poor kids?  Do an a third world edition
Logistically, how did they pull this off? Did they go to the barbecue or did the barbecue come to them? Is there Texas BBQ in the UK?
Wait! No dessert? Banana pudding or peach cobbler? Oh well, loved their reactions anyway.
Is there an underline situation in the UK?? Why are these boys separated by race???? I bet you never noticed?? Because you're so use to it??? THAT IS A BIG PROBLEM
where did they get this bbq from so i can buy it
When can we get another video of the og highschoolers? We need more of them back on
How do they get the food there lol
Is it just me or does Harry look like Goob from Meet the Robinsons?? 😂😂😂
@11:42 😂 Whats in it? Well you got your beans........and pit!
why did you group the kids like that?? some particular reason??
Did you warm them all of the meat sweats? Or, how they'll be ready to pass out after viewing down like that? We love all kinds of BBQ in the US, but most of us only have it on special occasions.
So, how long before the meat sweats kicked in ?  😂
Why, why, why,,,, is this so entertaining?  Everytime?   Must be Jolly…🍕
Any American-Mexican here?
How are these kids 7,8, and 9 years old and in high school?
Can we get a reverse series of taking Korean High School Students to England?
Why did the first kid put the burnt ends in his mouth with his fingers like he was spider spinning a web? Lol
Is anyone having problems with subtitles or is it me 5:05
why does the headmaster look younger and younger 😂😂💜
1:19 how are these guys 9 yo?? They look a lot older.
How do they make simple words like “nice” and “lovely” seem so sophisticated and genuine
Are they really highschoolers? Look like middle school to me.
How did they get fresh cooked Texas BBQ all the way to a school in England?
why are the subtitles telling me how to install an esim into an iphone
Was the cornbread not sweet or something??
Why aren’t any Brit’s starting restaurants like these?  Just asking…
No butter and honey on the cornbread?!
How do they get the food there??
NEWBIE HERE:  How do they get Texas BBQ all the way to Britain while still retaining its "freshness"? I'm genuinely curious!
How do you get this food to the kids there?
Why did y'all buy such huge portions
What did you fellows do to the cornbread ? Cornbread is always one of the favorites at cookouts.
I wonder how and where the food on this show is prepared. Surely not cooked, shipped and reheated?
why are they so fancy?
Was the cornbread not honey cornbread? There's your problem!
Was it that there was nothing else to do in texas except prepare food that makes the bbq the best?
Cornbread and no butter? 😢😢😢😢😢😢 Maybe next time.
Why are they surprised with the beef sausage? What are their sausages made of?
Are they in Britain? How did they get Texas BBQ there & still taste good?
Pleaseeee answer. How do y’all get legit Texas BBQ to the kids in England? Do you fly over a chef? It looks great! I just don’t understand how they can try all these foods hot and fresh when so far away lol
Eating it fresh is the best way to have them try it 😋!! Is it fresh?
3:50 how is that possible?
It’s 2025. They weren’t cooking like this in 1800? I’m so confused. People have been smoking meats for centuries. 🤷🏾‍♂️
So do you cook onsite in the UK? if so how do you get the spices and the smoke supplies in the UK? Thanks
Why is brad pitt being highschooler again?
Where is the sauce? Every BBQ is better with a good sauce.
Have they had sweet cornbread?
Yall don’t have international phone plans? I pay like 10 a month extra and it’s normal.
THE BARK?? BHAHAH loveee the bark
Highschool? They look like tne year olds.
Is one of these kids Rory’s little brother?
Do they bbq over there or bring th food there or they travel here to the us ??
Does anyone else see Jesus’ face in the charcuterie board?
WTF? Does the UK not know about pickles? they put vinegar on fires, how is pickle not on their radar?
Is this the last video for this series or what? Y’all make it sound like the last one?
Now can you UK guys understand why we have a weight issue? 🤣 especially states like Texas
So is there a Texas BBQ place in England?
Do they ship the American food to England or the British kids to America? Or do they cook it in England?
I wonder if the other kids at this school are jealous of these guys
The cornbread you gave them wasn't sweet?! 😭💔
0:55 That child is in high school??
Where did you get this from, Josh cook it at home?
Do you not have any kind of seasoning because that’s what it seems like. I mean when you cook meat, do you just cook it and throw it out there to eat without putting seasoning on it?
How do you guys get meat into the UK?  Customs?   We could never bring any of you products back to Texas.  P.S. love the pickles park.
Soooo where did they get this in England?
Are these the 2 guys I've watched come over to the us and eat BBQ having other people try it? 😜 Great Idea! Have someone from the Us come over and cook it for you! Have a cookout!!! Lol! 🤣
Hey guys I love the channel! But is that AI images at the top right for the foods? I understand constraints but AI is kinda..
Wait...... Brits don't have pickles...? Or haven't ever tried them?
For the none cultured savages what is year 7 like 7 years since start of schooling?
You don't have ribs in England? Do you throw away the brisket cut from all your cattle?
How do yall cook bbq over there?
How do they get thos caliber of food there? Do they fly in a pit master or something?
Where are the British  girls' school? As an American woman, I'd like to see girls try our delicious food! I would have a group of boys and a group of girls who like to eat.
Are they really, all of them, british kids? REEEEEALLY?? 😂
13:38 is the south gonna let this slide?
Why is no one talking about the British brad pitt at 1:19 ??? Mack needs to play in a biopic for brad pitt 😂😂😂
ummm some of these kids do not look like high schoolers?
Road trip with Mr. Smith, when?
im sorry i cant be the only one to notice, but is there a use of generative ai for the food in the top right corner? ):
Hey guys. I have a question for you! Do you fly the British kiddos to America for these taste testings? I always wondered how you get all the fresh foods to them?
Is Ollie wearing a Mammoth shirt??
How about some cornbread with sweet cream butter and honey?
Why do they put the meat on these white sticks?
What would they know about flavor?? 😂😂
How do yall transfer this overseas??
What is tyler durden doing in a youtube video
How to they get this authentic food made? Did they fly some guys from Texas and hook them up with the meat and a smoker??
British beans are better? You mean the Heinz beans you eat that is an American recipe and company that was introduced to Britain during WW2?
Why is it always guys on this channel?
Is it just me or Harry looks like little Goob from meet the robinson? Hes so cutee
Are they cooking this food in the UK or flying it over? I can only imagine what these kids reaction would be if it was fresh
7 year olds go to High school in the UK?  Head Master Smith has his hands full.  Good luck with that.
why is this vid segregated jolly??
Does anyone know how they brought this to them? Did they use a local restaurant or was it frozen/flown back from Texas. I'm in the UK and am desperate to try this kind of food.
How are these people highschoolers? The oldest looks 12 and one of them is looks 7
Why do they have so many black kids when its a white country
How do they get this food prepared in the UK?
Pit beans? I'm from Texas, and I have never heard of pit beans.
Something is wrong with the subtitels or is that just for me?
people ask why americans are fat? cuz the food is so good
One question…. How many of them had the meat sweats and went into a food coma? 😎🇨🇦
Is this where I watch TEXUS Englishman?
Wait is beef sausage not a thing in the UK or is it just other meats chosen over Beef?
Would it be too English to ask for a knife and fork?
When is Jolly going to take the Head Master and some of the 18 year old students to America for a tour of the places you guys have gone to?  Seeing them at Terry Black's, Bucee's, HEB etc. would be epic.
Can you guys organize a trip to America for the kids and headmaster? The kids parents would have to help cover costs of course. I remember doing a German exchange program when I was in school and it was life changing for me ❤
Where is the potato salad? Other than that...happy to see the kids enjoy their BBQ.
Now was that cornbread buttered?
Where in the UK did you buy this, please?
Do you make it yourself? Or do you send it from USA?
When will you share with the gals?
I wonder how they would like Johnnycakes or hot water corn bread, or maybe some wonderful fresh corn tortillas, compared to traditional cornbread.  Also maybe a sweetened cornbread vs a savory.
Who supplied the BBQ for this video, and can I order some delivered?
These kids have been deprived. Never have eaten a pickle or Mac & cheese. And why was that kid confused that we had beef sausage in the US? Did he not think we had cows or something??
why the hell that one kid looks a lot like rami malek
Never had ribs before? Like how? Am I just really American? Even if you don't eat BBQ (not even Chinese BBQ ribs??), how does one not encounter ribs in any form? Not even beef ribs? Short ribs?
Never had ribs before? Like how? Am I just really American? Even if you don't eat BBQ (not even Chinese BBQ ribs??), how does one not encounter ribs in any form? Not even beef ribs? Short ribs?
Maybe they would like Northern cornbread more? 😉😂 And WHERE did you get this scrumptious BBQ from in the UK?!
Is there a Texas barbecue place in England?
@Jolly Are you wearing a Mammoth ski resort long sleeve shirt and did you go there? If so, how'd you like it(I'm from California and have been going there for over 40 yrs.) ? Also, did you guys go to Bishop CA. and visit Schat's Bakery?
Did any of them get meat sweats? That was a lot of meat to be feeding them. Plain cornbread needs butter or gravy.
Why does the cc not match the audio?
How did you get authentic Texas BBQ in the UK????
I kept wondering where the butter was for that cornbread? Makes a big difference!
Wait how did you bring that to them?
Did you guys use the edible silverware
How about food from somewhere like Cracker Barrel or Lamberts?
Love the headmaster.  Can you take him to Texas and Tennessee/Kentucky to try foods and bourbon?  But guys, cornbread has to be hot/warm with butter melting in.  Can't just have it cold in the middle of the meal.
Why do they act like they've never seen moisture on protein before? Like is it an English tradition to have arid bangers and sandy mash?
I'm curious: How do you get Texas BBQ all the way London? There are some fast food these kids have had I know don't have outlets in London, so how do you get the food there? Who makes it?
where is the butter for the corn bread?
Do these guys ever age lol seeing some of the regulars on the channel, they still look like the middle school days😊
Where did you get the barbecue from?
Did they show a whole brisket for every group???
Why does Harry look like the live version of Goob from Meet the robinson
Where are the sarcastic funny lads?  Theo and Lorenzo are missed here! 😢😅
Who made that cornbread? It can be the star of the show if you make it right.
WTH is up with the captions? Lol.  Now you know the American weight issue lol.
So why are Britt’s still eating 17th century food this day and age anyway? You kids don’t have to grow up on bread and beans it’s not hard to bbq a piece of meat
What I’d like to know is how do they bring the American food to UK? Reheating the meat cooks it more and looking up import laws you can’t bring in beef from US to UK. Also the other vids have Taco Bell so that food would be sort of stale even with reheating. Anyway just curious on the behind the scenes
Cornbread requires copious amounts of butter and, optionally, honey. For the love... eating it dry?!?
I think I need to know how they're getting this BBQ.  Did it get shipped?  Did someone in the UK try their best?
Where was this cooked at? Obviously it wasn’t in the states, and that’s totally fine. Just curious to learn where I can get some good BBQ when I’m over there, which is usually a couple times/month.
1:18 is that fuckin Brad Pitt? LOL
How are they getting this stuff in England for these
Is Mr. Smith sure he wants to go to Portugal and not Texas for vacation?
where did they get the bbq in england?
They dont have pickles in the UK???
WHY is British cuisine so BLAND??  Even the monarchy prefers French vs British cuisine.
"Are you lying?..... (*eats brisket)..... He's not lying"
Who has someone eat unbuttered cornbread?!  You monsters!
Is it just me or does that one kid resemble Brad Pitt?
Who in the hell teaches these kids how to eat?
Is this all from Red Dog? It looks amazing. What a joy to watch the boys enjoying proper barbecue. And always a treat to se Mr. Smith absolutely living for it. I agree with everyone here who wants you all to bring him to America at the summer holiday one year.
How do they get the food there? They fly with it in checked luggage? 🤣🤣🤣
Why did you give them cornbread without butter or honey?
So where can I find this American food in London?
How does he get the food there?
Why aren’t there any women high schoolers?
Why are the students segregated?  And why does the headmaster eat alone?
Why does one of the kids look like goob from meet the Robinsons?
Im curious how they get American food to these kids, is it the bring frozen barbecue from America, or do they have a private chef make it in England?
Do British people not use cutlery?
Does British Law permit exposing underaged boys to TX BBQ?  They'll run away and join the rodeo.😮
Where’s the butter on warm cornbread ? Brits just don’t get it ! Like tacos without sauce or salsa !!
When are you going to have female highschoolers do this?
did oli cook it all everytime they hate something his face seems like a 4star chef hearing the food is just ok
Why aren't they using eating utensils
1:32, where are your glasses and the lightning bolt-shaped scar, Harry? 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Why did all the boys pore the beans onto the bread? You're just supposed to eat it with your utensils 😮
5:19 are they sending me to 🇵🇹? I'm so excited!
Is it just me or does the headmaster's accent change at 6:29? Love seeing everyone just completely abandoning British decorum to go at it with their bare hands; must have been some really good BBQ.
out of curiosity, they never have girls in this series, why is that?
is British food that bland, that this kids say it's the best thing they ever eaten? 😂
Where is the corn on the cob?
Guys, how do you get these meals to them? Assuming you fly a chef out from a place you’ve visited? I can’t grasp this concept
What happened to the previous students?
@4:52 are they twins?  Looks like they're coming to America. Gotta go to New York and Texas and California
How did you get the barbecue to them?
Are those twins?
Do they not have pickles in Britain?
How do you ship all that to them ?
Why are the black kids segregated?
Dumb question, where are you sourcing this?
my question is where did they get that level of quality texas bbq in the uk? did they make it themselves?
How do you get it back home &still serve it freshly cooked??
How do they get it to the uk
How did they get Texas barbecue to the Uk?
Where in the world do they get this BBQ from?
Ahh, yes... but was the cornbread, mac and cheese, and beans made properly? And where is the potato salad?
Who cooked the BBQ?
But does Mack look like a young Brad Pitt to anyone else?
Who made that BBQ? Did they set up a smoker outside?
Why is there cornbread being served without butter?
Why do yall try to sell someone on our cornbread without BUTTER??? 🤷‍♀️🤦‍♀️
Wait, what happened with the beans and cornbread? 😢 I like that they like it. That's awesome!
what age do you start high school in the uk? why do some of these kids look 10-12?
Love their reactions & delight..BUT how did they get Fresh Texas BBQ across the pond?
How do they get this food over there and still be good?
Where did they find that food in uk? would love to try it
So I'm curious, did you bring someone back from Texas to make this haha?
What are these parents feeding these kids--or should I say what AREN'T they feeding them ??!! So sad !!
did it come from texas
I wonder how often the kids go home, tell their parents they want that again. And their parents just curse you guys for brining all this amazing food to taste
Did he hurt his hand? One of the boys I mean
where did they get texas BBQ from!
How did they get Texas BBQ to the UK?? 🤷
Have you ruined Sunday Roast for these youngsters? 😊
Why was the cornbread so dry, boys? You need salted butter and honey.
Why do they always say "high schoolers", but it's ALWAYS just boys??
Why do yall segregate the kids during the interview?
highschool? look like 6-8th graders
Josh is equating the beef sausage with a hotdog? No. In the US hotdogs are considered “technically sausages” but they’re never what we mean when we’re talking about sausages.
Im curious. Are you getting these items from a local restaurant, or ordering from the US and shipping over frozen?
Crucial question: was the cornbread made with sugar or without? As a Midwesterner, I always make my cornbread with sugar, but my understanding is that that's a divisive issue in the South. Suffice it to say, I wouldn't like eating unsweetened cornbread either, especially if no one gave me any butter or honey to put on it.
Did they get the "meat sweats?"
oh my word what are you feeding those poor kids in GB? just beans?
These are high school students? They look like they're 9 years old.
Im just curious do we know who cook all that ? Is it gaby ?
Don't they have any female British high schoolers?
At what age can you legally  move to America? Well played. Come on over...to the land of well fed immigrants. 😊
Why do some of the kids wear blue ties and others wear purple ties (and one with the yellow stripes)? Does the color designate the year?
What is the single most popular complaint that Jolly British people have about American food?       Too much flavor😢 Poor snowflakes.
Would you die for Israel in trade for access to that??
Was the bbq cooked there? How did it get to England?
Why we don’t have briskets and ribs like that here in UK. Everyone loves it when they try it, instead we get kebabs here 🤢🤮 which ain’t even cheap
Where did they get the food from?
How do you get the American food in UK? Especially fast food not in the UK? Do you guys have a cook? I've always wondered.
Is the BBQ from Texas or is it from a restaurant in England?
I'm curious about the "Texas fold".  I was born in Texas and have lived in 15 different towns in Texas in the last 70 years and never saw anyone do this or heard the term used??
Wasn't this video already made before?
How do you get this great food to the UK?
Could u maybe try doing the same kinda thing in a college or uni?
Where's the texas twinkies?
Where did the food come from? Did you bring a chef? Give credit to the cook!
Burnt Ends? Ain't that the the rough part of town?
Anyone notice the AI icons used?
How is the Nigerian an ethnic Brit?
Who prepared it for them?
Who made the food?!?!
Just curious, did they buy this food in the US and then prep it there?
Uni students tour of the southern states ??
Where was this food cooked? Was it reheated?
You wanted it to be more bland?....  Yes. 😂💀
How many likes do we have to get for a British HeadMaster tours Southern US BBQ series ?
Can you do a video with Ed Currie and try Pepper X, please 🙏🏻
So do they take TX BBQ to Britain or do they take Britons to the TX BBQ? Since they are in a school I assume they take the BBQ to Britain. Either option doesn't sound very practical but I guess with 4+ million subs anything is possible lol
Is there a reason you guys don’t ever bring food to a girls school? I think they’d also love to try these foods.
Who made that brisket??? Tell me it was Josh or Gabi! Maybe Papa Weissman when he was in the UK? That's a dang good looking brisket! Nice and juicy, tender, bark looks great too! And I'll make that kid some cornbread he'll be begging for it to never run out!
How are you able to get the food there fresh?  Always been curious about that.
Is it just me or does, Mack look like a younger Brad Pitt 😂 Also the headmaster is the  goat 🐐🗿
Who does the cooking to bring this delish meal to the school? Their reactions are always so fun to watch! 😁
How do these kids go home and eat dinner with their families after this?
Do they bring in a pitmaster from Texas? Or, like, fly it in a cooler? Or just fake it?
How are they getting fresh American BBQ to the yougins in the uk? Is there a BBQ joint over there run by an American?
No Banana pudding?? 🤔 Or dessert (pecan pie for me). Disservice to these kids lol. As an American I always love watching these videos and their reactions of our great food for the first time! 😊🇺🇸. Keep it up 👍.
If it isn't sweet corn bread, you need to put some unsalted butter and honey on it.  And where are the grilled beans?  You got the pit beans but no grilled beans.
I wonder how they pick which kids get to participate. Also this headmaster is always the best.
Wots all this then?
Where's Theo? He was so funny
But how did they get it there??
Isn’t high school the equivalent of years 10-13? End of secondary school and college
Do you guys get summer break there? Bring the Headmaster to America some time. Let him experience some of the authentic stuff.
Were did you get the BBQ?  Was it the place you took Ollie's father?
so is the cornbread you use it like... to scoop and absorb the juices and fat on the plate, leftover from eating the meat? Thus, you have a flavorsome spongey bread?
Why didn't you give these kids knives and forks? You eat ribs with your hands, but brisket and sausage require a knife and fork.
How do you get the brisket in the UK? Is there a vendor you use?
Okay but who smoked it, and when, and where? They didn't fly the kids to Texas. Did they have the food shipped to the UK from Texas and just reheat it? Was it made in the UK?
This was cute, but why do the white kids always have such bad haircuts? It looks like they all went to the same bad barber.  The also look more like Junior High kids too. They all look too young to be in High School.
Oh I presume the Texas style BBQ came from the same London England restaurant where Josh and Ollie took Ollie's Posh Dad?
Did they fly in a Texan? 😦
How do you get this Food for them in the UK?
Where did you guys buy this food from? Do they deliver to Putney?
Why? Why? Why don't you all ever not put any butter on the cornbread? No one ever eats cornbread without putting butter on cornbread or hushpuppies! It's an absolute sin!😮
Do the brits not learn to eat? It's like it doesn't register how to get the food into their mouth properly and then the flavors don't register because they have never eaten anything  with spice or seasoning. Too much texture in Mac n cheese
Are these kids in the USA?  How do you source this wonderful stuff in Britain?
I wonder who they asked for help with this. Because it isn't easy to make this magnificent artwork happen.
Who the hell is ruining steaks so badly over there that you don’t consider the fat to be one of the best parts??? If the cook knows what they’re doing, the fat should melt in your mouth.
Honest question, do yall fly a cook from the States over there to prepare these meals, or do yall just have someone follow a recipe? Love the videos, and im so glad yall went to Darrels while yall were down here in SWLA!!
Do they not have seasonings in England. Why is they’re food so bland?
how are you getting all this food to the UK
These kids never go out to eat? Like jolly comes with fast food foods, they are all amazed with it. Like whej they bring taco bell, Wendy's, five guys, and others.
I apologize if you've answered this already, but do you have the food shipped there frozen and prepare it before the show? Or does it come ready to eat? I must know, please!
I just want to know how you guys get the food from America there??? If its all home grown ingredients, how the hell cant you make the food we make???
Serious question: How did they get that food over to the UK?? Did they take one of the pit masters with them to cook it, or...? Genuinely curious...
Question how do you get them authentic food from us ? Does someone cook it there  Or like a burger from a fast food place how do you replicate it for them
I’m going to England for the first time next month, any recommendations? I’ll be in Yorkshire
Where did you get this delicious Texas BBQ in the UK please???!
Are pickles not a thing in the UK? I dont expect them to be as big as they are in the US, but they're reaction to them suggestions they're rare.
Is this a reupload
Is it me or does Harry look like young goob from meet the robinsons
What does year 7 and year 9 mean ?
When are you bringing the headmaster and the students to Texas? Get some of the 3 star Michele star BBQ! 🥩🍖
