can we have another SM GAME CATERERS with the whole SM Family? if it's not possible then can we have all NCT units instead?
Why do they keep giving oxygen tanks? These guys need electrolyte / rehydration drinks. Oxygen maybe but it  is the essential salts/water that really need replacing. This is very sweet and funny though. 🎉 Suho looks defeated 😢😂

Suho, are you so old that it's so hard to guess the song correctly?😂😂

6:23 WHY THIS SONG REMINDS ME OF “Dragostea din tei” by O-Zone?🫣
Am I the only one who as soon as hearing the song candy, I could immediately visualize seungkwan singing fearless and yunjin dancing to it in hybe x game caterers ❤?
Did they seat them by the year the debuted? We are missing some groups like f(x)
Every member's face on the jellies?? What about han?
6:00 THERE’S A KOREAN REMAKE OF DRAGOSTEA DIN TEI??!?! 🤣🕺🏼
23:46 what happened to key in this part? lol
what’s the spray can key and suho used?
18:59 Karina throwing better punches than Mike ? 😂
Can anyone tell me the name of the songs?
DRAGOSTEA DIN TEI ISN'T THE ORIGINAL SONG ???
Excuse me, but what did suho spray in the his mouth in  43.50?
why are there wreaths in the background, sm is that now your trademark after everything that happened?
If I write EXO name how many likes I get?

Why are the 4th gen idols so awkward with each other whereas 2nd gen just vibing like siblings 😂
Do any one remember joshua by looking at the prize
Does Suho not interested in music?
karina's so damn funny wtf? like she got the SM blood SM artists are always funny on any show

I wonder who's better on music quiz: Key or Heechul 💙
Is it me or is the song at 6:00 just dragostea din tei?
can jyp kids be on this show, want to see the whole jyp group guess the song and dance to it they are very good at dancing
why karina is so funny and pretty??? 😭😭😭
29:24 Why SM ppl think of rude when they talk about YG/ hiphop? Hul, I guess that’s why the racist ones come from SM’s groups   And the funny thing is that the most respectful idols come from YG (90° bow) unlike the new generation of idols (not SM in particular)
Y’all think they’ll ever do a JYPE vs HYBE vs SM vs YG vs Starship vs other company type content?? 😅 or that’ll be too scandalous 🤔🙃
Does anyone know why they keep spraying oxygen?
Why do I feel like they are bullying suho 😢
Why does watching Key sunbae remind me of boo seungkwan ?
Why is Seulgi so cute
What kind of caffeine does kibum run on😭😭😭 wonbin is getting babied so hard love to see it🥺
The song at 6:10 is a Korean Song?!!! Gosh that was so popular back then I thought it was a Latino song
Can we just insert Changmin in every variety show? The man is hilarious 😁❤️
Can we talk about key's enthusiasm? He's so competitive lol😂
Am i the only one who's not getting to see the song's name in English captions?
Is there anything way for use to tag JYP!!!!!! ?
This was so fun! So many funny moments. Doyoung holding Kangta's hand like an old man to dance to Candy song was hilarious! Is it impossible to ask for more videos of them together again? 😄
18:54 SUHO, what was that?
