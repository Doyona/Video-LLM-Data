Wait this song slaps so hard??? Why is going on with the promotions?
Why is the camera so shaky jyp spend some money on them I know you have it
what does ‘im like commas’ mean??
Are we all gonna ignore what happened with VCHA?
Was it just me who noticed how Lexi's leg looked? 2:00
CAN YOU IMAGINE A COLLABORATION BETWEEN THEM AND LITTLE MIX ALL 8 WOULD MAKE GOOD CHOREOGRAPHY AND MUSIC.🤯🤩🤩
Is it OK to be a kid and watch this?
Where is the rest?
The girls did an amazing job! I love the music but i feel like lexi didn’t get enough lyrics..??
Why isnt this in  2M.
Has the view numbers not gone up at all? Looks like it’s remained the same only 😮😢
A set? Are you serious JYP?
wth is this?
Am I the only one that thinks 2 minutes is to short for a song?
Lexie is like she just got upgraded, wth?? Looks, moves and specially voice wise she is so good!
Isn’t this just and itzy demo??!?!
Where is the mv 😭😭🙏🙏
This song is a banger, why is the video so poor?!
Hold on, aren't they the girls from VCHA????
She is singing live or not? If it is singing live she is much more better than most of kpop star... 😂😂😂 Ppl these days only care about face and forget that one of idol job is singing stable while dancing
Damn a girl group I actually like and this is all y'all got?? Where's the mv jyp???❤❤❤
Im been waiting a year for this?? Idk guys, I'm a buge fan of them but I prefer to stand more katseye  They have a grate voice but why are they not dropping a mv yet? Or a new album? 😔✌️
what is this song…
Where is the mv????
When does the vm come out???
Is this the mv? So cheap! The girls look cheap! Specially lexus look like soooo normal ? Jyp cammon is that all you got!? Hayyyys they need kg they looks like nothing without kg...
Why can’t I found the song on Spotify and is this a single or what
Who is the main visual?
I still remember vcha stans r so mean to katseye called them flops when they released debut mv now katseye is popular now where r those vcha stans can't even stan those favs ??
Little Mix is that you?
Just Choreography???? We need a mini album
we waited weeks just for this??? i love the choreography but the mv isn't giving 🤦🏻‍♀️
Song is good but this is not the only music video is it? Who is running jype? What a mess😅
Where is the mv ? I saw the teaser but mv ?
Only 2 minutes?? Is it an intro or smth?
Who's the brown haired girl ? I'm new ,sorry !
Lexus and Savanna 1:47 what?!?!! ❤️‍🔥🔥
I mean I love it for her , but wasn’t the song too short or is there more to it ? In the album pls
This song was promoted a WHOLE month and then they just show us the girl dancing on a dressing room?! The girl actually deserve better and the fans deserve a better MV
Where is the other members? I want them to become the old vcha again 😢
is this vcha?
Are we just forgetting about Vcha? I’m confused af loll. Their amazing but instead of dealing with that controversy we just keeping adding new groups? I really am confused😂
who even ask choreography version??💀poor my girls jype usa treat them like trash
How we doing on charts, please update
Why is this song called commas? Makes no sense
This song is actually so good so why isn’t there a real MV??
What happened to Vcha?
Lexi with her red shoes and the red carpet is like...wait! Where are her legs??? 😂
can someone tell me why they don't have MV?
All the teasing for a month, just for 2 minutes?
Why they just four andd... Change name? Where is the real Vcha😢
SO where's the MV???
who are they?
Has the cameramen never framed choreography before or did the editors crop the video…
Jyp? How about the promotion of girlset? Why does we didn't feel nor see it?
Where is the MV ????????
I'm confused...There's no MV??
Don't some of them look like some of the girls from vcha
Why the video and camera work looks like a cheap production, omg JYPE is so hard for you do something good for them?
what the heck i've been waiting for a whole month just for this????? , where is the mv ?
Wait isn’t this vcha or am I tweaking?! Cause OMGGG❤I barley even recognized them
what in the itzy
What in the ITZY reject is even going on?
I‘m simply asking: shouldn’t a choreography version not actually show the choreography?
where's the MV? nani?  why put a teaser as if there's going to be one if theres not?
Wheres the mv?!?!
The song is perfect at every moment, but why is leeknow scant? I didn't understand this.
Where the f is the budget
Choreography video before the actual MV? 🤣 Spend money for GirlSet omg...
What is this erm
We wait all this time and we don't have even a Mv????? JYP??????🤨🤨
Why haven't you posted the MV yet? 🧐
The song is really good and the singers' skills hve improved a lot.... But What is up with MV???!!!
who choreographed this?
Was this recorded in a microwave ? The camera is too shaky
I was searching for the MV to watch it first, but there is none, how in their first song as a new group they don’t have an MV?? Feel so much for the girls who trained a lot of hours, days, weeks to just get a choreography version
I'm literally scratching my head wondering if this is both the official MV plus choreography?
Is this a new group ?
Is it just me or the best fandom name is girlies for girlset❤🎉😂
Are they in a Kohl’s dressing room? 😆
JYP nation stans PH where are you? Support Girlset gals.
JYP Nation PH where are you? Support Girlset gals
jpye for a girl group that you’re supposedly trying to rebrand you sure are doing the bare minimum. 2 minute song, cheap ass choreo video you’re trying to pass off as an mv?? is the creative team just bankrupt af? because none of these are helpful in changing the image of the girls, i feel bad for them
ok am i the only one got motion sickness? not even kidding atp
This is it?? No mv😔😔😔
Why post the dance performance before MV JYP? This looks messy...
Where’s the actual music video ???  Edit: nvm I much prefer the choreography version , cuz wtf was the “official mv” big fckn yikes
Who is the black hair girl?
where is the MV?
Where's the mv JYP??
they r 40yrs old with makeup?
we waited so long and still didn't get an MV?? I need more of GIRLSET
And when will the real MV be?…I don’t think this is going to be the MV Officially
Mmmmm.... no actually what is the identity?  😮 sounds a generic Kpop song
Is there not a music video
where is the mv??? 😭
Can they not afford a camera that focuses?  Yikes on bikes
I like the music, but no promotion and an MV?
I am worried looking at Lexi's leg at the end pose. Is leg okay? But I enjoyed this new direction.
Are they in the middle of an earthquake?  Who is controlling the camera. JYP PLEASE spend money on them because wtf is going awnnn. Why is the bridge so far into the song and why is the song shorter than my will to live. Im crying😭
For an official rebrand this was pretty underwhelming… I mean, I was expecting so much, the song is good, the girls look gorgeous, this concept definitely fits them well, they even did a whole marketing campaign from almost a month before release so WHY NOT GIVE THEM A FULL MV???
the song was so short like only 2 min? js like gnarly
the camerawork sucks soooo bad and why are they crammed into a little box of a room????? where is the budget??????
😮 Hold UP!! DamNNnNn! Are these the same ladies? WHAT? I'm SHOOK-ETH! ❤❤❤❤
where is the music video??? JYP needs to stop playing
Why are some of y'all hating on this song ? If you don't like it then don't comment because I think the song is really good
are they the previous V-Cha members?
Why is the song way too short and has no MV??
Where's the mv?
Is this the only official MV??? Is it really???? HOLY CRAP
Where's the MV JYPE????? But the song is rlly good but just sooo short.
Where is the mv
so would there be another version like an actual MV? 🤔
Why were more frames shown in the teaser, but they are not in the clip?😔🤔
Why not mv tho? Is there new music coming soon?
why do most of you guys pissed just because they released choreography version first? i think it’s unique tho. choreography and then mv
Where is the MV!!???can someone remind me when its drop 🗣️
When will the MV be released?
I'm so incredibly happy for these girls! They killed this one for sure! I hope they have many more successes together! And is it just me, or do they totally remind you of the Bratz!?? Even the promo & cover photos for Commas 100% gave me Bratz Rock Angelz vibes 😂 I love it!!!!!!!
Where is MV. It's like dance performance then mv ??
is this a cover?
Why are y’all supporting this after what was revealed??
JYPE has loads of funds, so why are they holding back for these girls???
That was so good but why is it only 2 minutes?
Where is the mvv
Can one help me i love a20 may and atheart music. but how does a20 have 36 million views but only 70k likes and atheart have 36k likes and 15 million views. how do they have more views than girlset. Girlset have 87k likes and only 750k views
I don't understand the meaning of the song. Could someone explain what "being commas " mean?
What happened to the 6 of them
Can the camera back up 😂😂😂
Who are they?  They're amazing!!!
BUT WHAT!? Where is the MV!!
So we're only gonna get a choreo MV and 1 live stage? JYP taking his sweet time promoting them....yeah right! He needs to do a better job promoting them
Wait is their name not vcha anymore?
Do yall think they have a mv
Is this the official MV? I’m so confused. JYP hyped us for nothing. I mean the girls all look good, the song is catchy too but the MV is so underwhelming 😢
where’s the actual video?
I thought JYP will released an mv of this song but instead, a choreography video, the song is good but only one set...? JYP, treat the girls better soon...
Is this a new group?
Its mv oficcial or mv coreo? Ate girlset
Omg the song is AMAZING Jyp??? WHY YOU DOIN THEM SO DIRTYY TFF
All this build up and no actual MV?
Why is this js a choreography video where’s the mv
so much excitement just because of the choreography? 😢😢❤❤❤
who are them???
WHERE IS THE MV??????????? JYP IS THIS REALLY THE MV? 😭 WE'VE BEEN WAITING AND THERE SO MUCH THAT HAPPEND EVEN GIRLSET REBRANDED BUT WHY IS IT LIKE THIS??????
2 minute only????  That's stupid why would they do that...
Who the hell is the short hair girl, like she’s the only that doesn’t look familiar
is this song about pay for play?
Aren’t they a bit old????
JYPE really doesn’t know how to produce songs, why is the mixing SO bad and the chorus so soft? They actually had potential, it makes me so mad
How could some of you not like the song? It's great. The only thing I don't like is the chorus, but I love it for that.
Where is the MV? 😢
Who is this band?
they ate but why is it so short?!
Where is the mv
If we give them the str3Ams, would JYP give them a legit MV?
Only one set?
Is jyp set to ruin this group ? To have an excuse to stop giving them anything?? Because why is this before the MV? And why is it too short? And why just a single?
0:22 what is her name? im in love with her vocals such a unique voice
where is the budget?😞
All that hype for a 2 minute song and not an actual MV? And the verses didn’t even flow well compared to the chorus? JYP what is going on????
THE VOCALS ?! What ?!!
I just don't understand why the performance video was released first. Is this the official video?
When does the mv come out?
Is this a new girl group? They slayed
was the mv scrapped or what? the teaser looked like it had mv scenes rather than performance ones
new girl group?
this is not their title track right? like... it's good but JYP can do WAY better. I'm only talking about the song, the girls slayed what they were given.
What about give Lexi more lines ? I just hear the annoying Kendall pitch way too much
JYP is that real? Not official MV and a 2 min song? No mini album at least ? They deserve better.
So short, whyyyy?
Love the song but why did JYP release a choreography ver. before an actual MV? 😭 We NEED an MV
New girl group??
Is this a debut??
They look grown up and different even though they're still minors. The song is good but is it healthy for them and are they ok? 😭😑
don't get me wrong this was great but where's the actual music video? the girls deserve a full comeback
They put so much effort on VCHA and can’t even do the same for their rebranding? This needed more commitment and money as to redeem JYP and the girls image after what happened.  It’s short and we’re only getting the choreography video on the release date?  seriously what’s going on…
You couldn't even give them a music video?? Wtf
Quick, who's your bias?!?!?!?!
What happened to Vcha?
what the fvck where's the MV????
They are rebranded and don’t even deserve an MV? For god’s sake
help me guys... I'm confused. Is GIRLSET a sub unit? And what about Vcha? Are they still continuing?
Who's the black haired guuurrrlll? Ate the dance 👌🏻
They debuted again with another name????
Is the song audio like this? Even in the audio the chorus instrumental always sounds muffled? Is it just my phone or is it really how it sounds?
Is that the mv?
who are they? Where is Vсha?
Why are they giving me Itzy vibes 🤨🤨🤨
Where's the mv? Did they send the choreography version first?
Umm, when will the music video be released? I've been waiting for it for ages lol
This feel so pre-released. I feel like they might drop something   more?
Why isn’t there like an mv
Rebrand but not the MV what is this treatment!? This is already like low budget lol feel bad for the girls but love the song
where's the actual music video?
Weren't they 6 and his name is vicha?
When so when is the me Gina get released or is it just the cheeography
When does the merch come out? They are so beautiful
Wait where is the MV?
Is jyp broke or something why didn't they get a music video for their first rebrand song???????????
Bro what was GIRLSET budget for their debut ??? A gum and 5 cents??? JYP raise the budget.
We’ve been waiting for over a year for something new from these girls and they don’t even get an MV debut? They have potential, but JYP keeps giving them nothing
why this first before the MV?
I want to like it. But why not put out an official video instead of a choreography video? This video feels rushed and low-budget.
why does this sound familiar
What is the name of the one with short hair?
Before the MV everything out?
will there be an official MV? i was expecting an official MV... not a choreo version. 😳
Will there be a full music video?
Why is the song such bad quality and the video so poorly made? Everything seems low budget
where is mv this is only choreography video vote for mv
Why so low budgeted?
Is this a kpop group?...
Why they release the performance video instead the mv??? hello????? we want the mv, these girls deserve more than thisssss!! (i love the song and everything but i thought they would give us at least an mv...)
Is this the official mv?
choreography before the mv? seriously?
official video is just one place? to dance and sing?? 😑😑😑
There isn't MV?
Why is this song so short-
Where is other members.?
Someone actually approved this song and heard a hit? Good luck to them.
Not an MV!? 2 minutes!?
Omg, not even a Music Video? 😅
Where's is the leak bridge?
Why does JYP struggle making songs that aren’t corny as hell
is this Little Mix ??
So short and no mv? 😢😢
Will we see them go live on a kpop music show?
Where's the MV? 😢
Excuse me?? Savanna's vocals??? They're amazing. Camila is incredible, she's a majestic all rounder.
Who are they and why do they sound so bad?
The camerawork is horrible! Why tf do  you never see the coreo!!??
No music video? Or am i missing something?
Wait, are they releasing a choreo ver before the actual music video? Never seen it done that way before. Or are they just not getting a music video? Also, jesus christ, barely 2 minutes is ridiculous, I've heard longer album interludes. Pretty good though, short or not.
Why is song short 😢😢😢
these girls deserve better!! this all seems to be such a low budget, shouldn't they at least get a mv?
New blackpink?Or new aespa?No...this is new generation of kpop-I LOVE IT
they're not even getting a mv? 💀
Who tf are these😂 not even kpop😂
I hope jype gets ads for the main mv Promotion is important cuz how will people find out about this bop if they ever see it???
How can a 2-minute song *EVEN HAVE A BRIDGE?* I'm low-key impressed. Either way, it's a lot like my style now. Loved it. ❤
So what's the fandom name?
WHERE THE MV?
Where's the MV version?
did they forget there should be a MV too?
Song is so good but why MV as choreography?
Choreography version but you keep zooming into their face so we can’t actually see the choreo??? Great, thanks 👏
Wait so vcha redubuted with new name? After kg and kaylee left
Why you post choreography video first instead of official one? That's weird
Waited doo long to only get a choreography video? It's unfair for my girls
The song is actually pretty good but at 2min? Also, more effort/creativity needed on the MV. I've seen MV shoot out door running around on an Iphone so much better.
this is amazing but whre is the mv?
Why is it so short? I'm so over songs being under 3 minutes. I enjoyed what's there but come on
Is there going to be a mv?
is there no music video..?
Bridge starting at 1:26? What’s that 😂
is there an official mv? or only choreography mv atm?
are we just going to forget and move on from the fact that one member sued jype for mistreatment and another member left??? yall girlset supporters have no backbone.
where are you from??
Why so shortt??😭😭😭
WHY WAS IT SO SHORT😭
why its not mv ??
Are they getting an M/V or not? And hopefully their debut song is different, this isn't terrible but way too short and the transition between verses and the chorus is a little rough
Is this a global girl group
Can I ask for infor about this group?
Can anyone recommend a song like this please?
Why only 2 minutes? O.Q
Where the hell is that pre chorus from the teaser snippet looool
Sorry but a redebut and is only a choreography version?? They are not even trying
Wheres the MV?
Way too short, I think... Idk... Am I the only one who didn't like it? They slay, but the lyrics are definitely a big no.
I thought they are separated from jyp?
What is wrong with the shaky camera
Wait, no official MV?
Why so short??😢
they're testing the water with only the choreo vid? idk but looks like there won't be an mv.. :(
Where is mv?!?!
2 minutes? I get ads on YouTube longer than this song 😭
Bro where is mv? Good song but it's too short.
is this the mv??
The song is good enough but why do they make videos on a low budget.. totally they dance in a small room like how??
Where is the mv?
Where is the MV 😢
WHYS THIS SO SHORT?? THIS IS SO GOOD
why is jyp so unoriginal😭
The song is good except thst last instrumental part at the end - could have extended and made it even more dancey for a dance break?? Too simple instrumental or maybe so quiet idk
2 minutes?! Are streams really that important?
What's with the clip? Why isn't it super well shot?  (Don't haight!)🥲
Where is the mv though?
Who them??? New gg??
Just one thing I'm curious about. Are they adults yet?
Where's the mv ??
There’s no real MV? This is it!? Really JYP?
Ok yeah now I’m confused because it’s past 12am PT and it’s the time they posted they’d have their MV out but it’s no where yet. Maybe there’s technical difficulties? Idk
The choreography holy crap?!! 🔥
The mixing audio kinda off? What happened jyp? I hope it's only introduction song ❤ comeback with baddie song pls
where is the mv
How old are they?..
jyp global girl group??? ALSO PLEASE NORMALIZE 3 MINUTES SONG AGAIN 😭 THIS IS TOO SHORT
So there’s no mv?
Heyy, where's the MV? Good song tho!
Didn’t even give them a proper MV? Come on JYP…
Wdym choreo version?? Will release version 2??
Why is this song so short!!!!!!!!! But it's still sooo good
is there no mv for this?
GUYS I NEED HELP LIKE RNN😭 can u tell me thei names and how they look by tgei names??? PLEASE CAUSE I ONLY KNOW KENDALL CAUSE SHE IS MY BIAS
don’t get me wrong they absolutely devoured but why post a choreography ver if 90% of the video is too zoomed in to even see the choreo? i’m not hating on the girls or the song!!!!
110k? Why use ads here bro, Soojin is better youtube
Why is so short? It's so good ❤
1:02 what’s her name? all of my attention went to her she has that star power idk how to describe 😮😊
Yeess Savanna’s vocal improvement??? She is the lead vocalist now.
Where's the MV tho?
this and VCHA?
Why is the song so short ? 2 minutes ?
OMG I'M OBSESSED Y'ALL WHERE IS THE MV?
..... flop? Where is the marketing?
wait where mv ?????
wait, where is the official mv??? only choreography ver??
Who drops choreography version before official mv version
Where is the MV ?
İs that a new girl group?
I didn't even recognise them until I looked in the comments! This is vcha?????
is that savanna?
can we go back to VCHA style?..
Proper subs? No?
What’s the point of a teaser if you post the choreography first? I can’t with this company
The MV looks very cheap or is it the choreography video??? 😢
nugu? can someone explain who are they?
Dude what is on with JYP's production and creative team? The song has huge potential for an iconic and explosive mv but they chose a dance performance instead. Isn't this supposed to be a rebrand? But they totally wasted the song's potential.
Are they gonna perform in korean mushow too? Nice song btw only too short😢
The song is soo good and stronh but,WHY IS SO SHORT?!?!😭
they have no MV?
What happened to the leaked parttttt it was SOO gooodd
The camera angles are terrible 😭 but the choreo and song is good✨ but where is the mv?
The song is so beautiful and it has everything a bridge, a dance break, 3 verses, 3 chorus so how is it that it's 2 minutes long?!
Jyp where is the mv ? Girls deserve better promotion .
what???? only 2 minutes 😢😢😢
okay but can we talk about lexi and savanna’s vocal improvement in such a short amount of time??? they killed this.
why is the choreography video first instead of a music video? 😭   i mean, still thank you.
When will the full MV be released?
i mean it shows 12am August 29th timer on the girls account? so maybe in about 2hours official mv should be out?
Wheres the actual music video?😅
Why post choreography before MV, Its annoying now, that and showing the whole chorus dance before release just spoilt it . It's a shame cuz the song is good, delivery not so much😢
Does it have an mv guyss??
Where's the mv?
So where the MV? Why performance version come first..
Wait who are they? Someone tell me pls
Where is the MV JYP
Hello? How much has Savannah's voice improved?
Is it possible to have just one girl group that isn't dressed/dancing like strippers? If the music is good, they don't need to show their bodies to gain a following🤢
Where's the main Music Video???
why is the song 2 min long?
Why the studio is soo crammed, choreo looks awkward from this close ,they should have booked a bigger studio and shot some wide angled shots to highlight the formation and hand gestures more appropriately, jype team either gets a low salary or they are just not competent enough,look at the budgets of these new kpop groups by other companies, Girls did good tho
How can i promote these girls if this video is bad.. it will only set them up
Only 2 minutes?!
Choreography only? Two minutes & two seconds?  Are you intentionally trying to make these girls fail? Because it sure looks like it to me.
Does this feel like it’s several songs stitched together? I like them. But this song doesn’t feel cohesive.
oh they change group name? i ddnt know..
The vocals??? The rap?? The dance ?? The visuals??? ATEE
Where is the mv?
Only 2 min? Too short
I truly don’t understand why JYP refuses to put more budget into them. If the artists work hard, then the company should do the same. It always feels like they deliver low quality when it comes to this group. 진짜 이해 안 돼. 왜 JYP는 이 그룹에 돈을 안 쓰는 거야? 멤버들은 그렇게 열심히 하는데 회사는 왜 안 맞춰주는 건데. 맨날 이 그룹만 퀄리티 낮게 나오는 느낌임.
Is this MV??
Aren’t “Only One” is Performance video too?… where is the M/V…
Why do we keep doing these sub 3 min songs? It just doesnt feel long enough. Other than that I enjoyed it.. But yeah a song ending at 2 minutes is not it!
2 minutes?!!! we need more??!!!
Is this the official music video already?
What’s with the camara work?
this is mv???? Stranger!
Can we change the camera man? He needs to go
where are the other girls?!!?!?!?
Even from the beginning they can not have proper MV, like an actual music video, it's always choreography version, wth???
after this will they be gone for a year?
Just TWO minutes???!! What's happening whit music nowadays 😢 its Sad at this point
Amazing! But why does it feel a bit empty?
WHOS BEEN HERE SINCE A2K??
How many of them left the group??
Okaay Vcha chill, tf did I do to you?! Switching up like tf??!😳
Love the song but dumm thats a small room for them to dance jyp?!!
is this 4th impact now?
The song and choreo are sooo good 😭🔥 but why is the full version just 2 minutes?? I need moreeee!!
A 2 minute song is crazy short. 2 minutes and 30 minutes is already short but just 2???
where's the goddamn mv jype??!!! song is so good though, and the choreo *chef kisses*
only 2 minutes and 2 seconds? c'mon jyp u know u can do better
I need a proper reason why a good song like this keeps getting shorter and shorter? 2 minutes and 2 seconds cannot give me enough satisfaction???
We are getting another MV right? Cause this is just Choreography Ver.
Feels like a pre-release for pre debut song than an actual title track debut song? Too short ,and budget ain't there. More like an introduction perhaps?
where's the M/V???? This is the first time a group that is debuting release Choreography version first.
i dont get it, so this song doesn’t have a music video?? why is the choreo ver is released first???
sigh 2 minutes? please stop this
Ok choreography??? Not m/v??? Ok 2 minutes???? Jyp give them normal rebranding..
So they do not have the mv mean this is not the redebut song or what??
2 Mins long??? Is this norm for POP Stars like Katseye?
Why is the chorus so addictive
what does commas mean in this context? I don't get it
WHERE IS THE MV
Damn Camilla hitting a high notes on Friday?? 1:37
What member country?
Are they gonna release a mv or not??? I like the song a lot❤❤❤❤
Where is the MV?
They ate that up and this song is so good (anyone know if this will get a M/V?)
There should be a MV, is JYPE checking the wave? Please do a good job PABOO JYPE
Where is the MV?
And my MV?? Where is it
The live performance was such a letdown icl, you had this long of a break but couldn't do any vocal training???
MV is coming or what??? btw this song is good tbh, yall stream hard for this banger lets go
the choreography version? okay.. It's good anyway
No mv? But the choreography still ateee 🫰🫰🔥🔥🔥
WHY IS THIS SO SHORT?😭😭 I LOVE IT❤
How many international fans are here to support GIRLSET? ✋ ❤
Where’s the music video??? The dance is rlly good!
What JYPE why this look so cheap 😢
Why the hell did they have to do a performance and not a music video? This song has too much potential for JYP to waste it like that.
so...there is no mv?
What about the mv
Where’s the mv ?
The teaser looked different than this? Where’s the mv y’all are allready fucking them over
Where’s the music video?

Do we get an actual MV not just the choreo version 😢
There's no MV?
Was the budget so low they couldn’t have them filming in any other places besides a closet? Y’all better not do my girls dirty.. they deserve better and only a 2 minute song wtf?!
Well there be a mv too or just the choreography version?
seriously no music video?!
Okay why is JYPE going cheap with these girls? I don’t want to be mean tho but VCHA first dance video was better then this one and where’s the MV 😭💔 I’M SO SORRY I DONT WANT TO BE MEAN, I FEEL BAD BUT STILL
Can we talk about there visuals 😳🤭 they are soo pretty!!!
Music video out when?
