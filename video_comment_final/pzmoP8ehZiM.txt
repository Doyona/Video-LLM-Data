Why am I crying?
Who cutting onions?
Anyone else think she looks like a different person from the audition?
why she make her voice squeaky maybe cus she’s young
And she didn't win the season why?
Would she really have gotten through if she wasn’t Lauretta Lynn’s granddaughter though?
Okay am I missing something here? I feel like this girl is hyped up just because her grandma. She can carry a tune but her singing is subpar to say the least.
Isn’t she Loretta Lynn’s granddaughter ?  Man she has song writing from the heart in her genetics !
Why do all these voices from the last 10 years or so sound like underdeveloped breathy baby voices?
What season and episode was this from??
why did she have to trigger our tearducts like that-🥲that was so beautiful.
Freeze the video at 1:54, lol. What's going on here?
What was Luke pointing at? 1:24
Why change the tune of the song?  Originality is best. Doesn’t have the same feel at all  Emmy does have a beautiful voice though. ❤
Decent voice, but why so many "these days " go for the "exasperated " sound? Carry that tune, don't abandon it
Ummm. Am I missing something? Loretta was a country music legend during her time. This girl, not so much.
She has a great voice but why would you change the style of this song away from the original? It's hard to beat the original.
Did she go off key a bit?
Why did she have to slow it down and ruin it, just do it the way it's supposed to be. It's not supposed to be sad or sappy.
