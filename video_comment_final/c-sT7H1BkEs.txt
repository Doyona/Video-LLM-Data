Valentine’s Day, wedding plans, home makeover, and... baby #3? Are you playing life on HARD mode? 😆 Wishing you luck and make sure to stay healthy—this level is intense! 😆
Hi Zoe, would you be able to please do a spring clothing haul!? PS… you are stunning!
What is this Camera?
I have two daughters too, 10 & 8 and I still feel lost and not myself. I can’t even remember who I used to be before children 😢 Do we ever find ourselves again? 💔
Hello zoe! Could you please let is know where you got your ‘Z’ charm necklace from?
Guyssss, doesn’t Zoe look like Ellen Pompeo (Meredith Grey) in the thumbnail!?!? Is it just meeee????
Could you do a video on your routine and how you get the girls to sleep please? ❤
Zoe here just looks so differentttt in a good way but I can’t point out what it is🤣   Maybe it’s the hair making her face look fuller? 😍😍😍😍  sooooooo prettyyyyy
Are the personality traits a 1st child and 2nd child thing? Like are you the older child? Is Novi more like Joe as a second child?
Does anyone know where Zoe’s Z initial necklace is from? 🫶🏼
Please please please do a full c section video! I’m a FTM due in June and I have to have a C section which is grand but I’d love to hear your experience ?
Why don’t you get a wedding mood board on the go and then speak to a wedding planner Zoe 🥰
I've seen a few comments mentioning the new hair is giving Jennifer Aniston (I see it) but for some reason my brain is thinking Ellen Pompeo and that somehow it makes you kinda look like her? Either way, your new hair looks so good and happy to watch another vlog of yours!🤗
How annoying like for years people have asked when are you having baby and now it’s when are you having another it never ends
What a beautiful start to a video with the valentines breakfast. Who does Novie get her dimples from? 😊
Don't worry, the awkward questions still happen when you have one of each. I always get 'oh you'll not want anymore then since you have one of each" 😅 my daughter is 12 and my son is 8 and I'm still not 100% sure that I'm done having kids haha. x
The matching pyjamas are ADORABLE 😭 where are they from?🩷
Who is getting married??
Zoe would a wedding planner not help? Or poppy or mark to help you?
