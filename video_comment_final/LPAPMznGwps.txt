Couldn’t you guys take the engine apart and build it?
16:42 Did you look that all up on Engine Patrol?
How old is the fuel in it?
Where did the new camera guy go?
How many mistakes you make from beginning that is not truth... 😮😮😮😮 Mike are you ok??
F12 companion ? Strip it and build it like the f12
You can still save it, right?
What in the fuck is that tow guy doing
Uhh, I have to assume that the trans is already fucked? Cause ya know, put it in neutral and PUSH it off? If it was in park that whole time and the flatbed driver knew that, then he needs to pay damages if there are any.
What I want to know is how does one destroy a GT at 22k miles 🤯
So, Mike, Who is “JASON SHAREK”? 😂
Mikes opinion on n54’s??? 😆😆 I wanna see him build one !
Where did you find that tow truck driver?
What about a hellcat motar
did they check the pyro fuse if its been in a crash that seems to go first when an airbag goes off
What happened to Yuvy
Why didn’t y’all put the go jacks on it to take it off the tow truck??
AMG GT3 / Drift project in the near future???  🙉🙈🙊
WTF unloading job is that?  He might as well just got in the tow truck and floored it to dump that GT on the ground
Is there a fuel shut off switch in it? If he hit a curb, couldn’t that have been tripped?
What about a z4 tranny? Also, what would be cool is if you guys rebuilt it and gifted it to one of your young aspiring mechanics. That would be cool to see.
Have you Two ever thought to make beanies to match the hoodies?
That’s a Mercedes GTR right? Or is it SLR? Just guessing based on the blacked out thumbnail
Where the hell are his skids BMW and Mercedes are bad to get into neutral that's why there's plastic skids even a mc Donald's tray would work and if we're talking bad tesla the worst thing in the world 😅
Hey Shawn you still got them jugs of coolant? Mike might need a few 😂
Marc please stop talking. Stay behind the camera, shutup & do your job (you quite literally ruin the element) 😅 Also is anyone else wondering what happened to fourth wall?
I wonder if mike likes drifting or racing more idk why but i just think about it here and there
New Shop Car?
Did anyone else notice all the white substance on the hoses? Typical of phosphorus from coolant. I bet it overheated!
Bad heat exchanger?
What happened to the camera guy for the stories channel?
Isn't that the same V8 twin turbo that's in Dave's Bentley!????
Is it possible to swap with 5.0 coyote engine on it
Mike's own DDE stories channel project car??????
What causes camshaft to break in 2?
How can you tell if a cars in neutral if the truck didnt stop
They fired the new guy who was doing the stories filming? Good idea to keep costs low but sad too!🫡🫡🫡🫡
do like the youtuber josh lerant has a motor he is doing a hemi swap inn his
def see if damon and dave want to it fix and prolly sell? lil investment??
Yo Mike, Toyota were leaning engines back in the 80’s, when did BMW start?  (Check Tim’s car’s 3S-GTE). 😊
Why not put a M156 engine in there. Would be tasteful as it remains an AMG and takes the NA 6.2l V8. Would be sikkkk
This smells fishy...Maybe another one of Daves skits?
OR you get the m159 NA engine for it. should work with the same transmission? gt3 body kit. could also just replace the engine and tune it for like 800-900.
Wtf is that tow truck operator doing ? Yea garentie he's done that before
I thought these were closed deck design?
Wait I know a guy that does this as a job....... MATT ARMSTRONG?????
Just drag it off with the forklift, wtf is that driver doing?
100 grand to fix it? they literally cost less then 100k used , wtf😂
Was that 3rd gen
Why did the plastic panels stop? I had one friend say they are necessary for air flow and sound! I think its all a gimmick 😊
a little skid plate under the tires? splash of soap? Mickey then it didn't start or didn't start then Mickey? NO unwanted guests chewed wire test!
Could be the spark plugs and starter
put a twinturbo s600 v12 engine?
AMG with 22K miles, seems like the original owner should have had a warranty, no?
I watched this old timer take repell bug spray put it on the lights wait then wipe off and looked cleaner then new try the taillights what would it hurt?
Pretty sure the air bag is a takata air bag? Because the air bag problem was one that effected many manufacturers, from hyundai to mercedez.
is that the same engine as in the Bentley?
Where is Mikes first supercar?????  He said a client asked him to look at this Mercedes for him.  And thats not a super car anyway.  I really hate how this channel always trys to click bait people.   Hope Dave the swindler isn't up to his old tricks again.
Those that didn't know now? Always known/seen him before...Mike was always underrated and a legend in the car community 🙌 ❤!
Why did you buy this heap of junk? Absolutely garbage
Hey Mike, ever thought about a 928 manual? They are boats but would sounds sick straight piped.
I wonder how well that Mercedes would drift since it’s smaller looks like the engine could be pushed behind the front wheels and its rwd. Would sound awesome. I’m never gonna be in the market for anything like that but those amg v8s sound nasty🫶  Blame it on brain damage thanks taliban  Also fml  Also also of course there ain’t no engine behind the rear wheels look at that sexy little ass
Tow truck driver doesn't have a bottle of oil to squirt under the tires to slide it? Not a good tow truck driver!
How much money does one have to just leave an AMG GT in your driveway after you move?
I’m assuming it’s the same guy that got Mike to build that crazy C63 when Mike was showing his shop? Dudes a die hard AMG guy respect
Does that 4runner have a powersteering problem also?! Lol damn sean
Where is UV?
Could be a cracked head or bad oil cooler
They didn't use those stupid bio degradable wiring harnesses in those, did they? I know merc did that at a point, and they had to swap harnesses on warranty.
What video is next?  The river of rain video………
