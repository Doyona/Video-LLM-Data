What is the matter with the people in the crowd who booed? They have just witnessed an astonishing sporting achievement and a truly nail biting race.
Frenchmen booing? The British are the champions of booing: see football, Formula 1, etc
So ye just left out how he closed the 38 second gap after the puncture at halfway?
Is this even legit?
For God's sake can you guys stop spoiling the result in the thumbnail!!?
French booing at the finish was disgusting..Why did the Eurosport commentary team just ignore it as though it didn't happen?
WHY not SHOW the mistake that allowed Pidcock to catch up in the first place???
Why the booing ? Don’t you recognise an amazing battle and great effort all round ?
Where is Nino?
