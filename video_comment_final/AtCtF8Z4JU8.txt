Where does the modern audience keep hiding?
What happened guys?! We loved you, we loved you soo much, I waited 10 years for this game and I am so disappointed
So you basically manipulated us and switched the dialogue?
Do you remember when this was a dark fantasy franchise? Pepperidge farm remembers.
So you watch a two hour film, play for ten minutes in a small map then back to watching the movie? Yikes
Remember when this franchise was an RPG?
Why does the main character look like Angelina Jolie? lol
so what in store for our saved files and our story from the past till now ?
Again... why do the faces look so damn cartoony?
Am I going to need a 4090ti pro founders edition super clocked liquid cooled GPU to have the same experience?
Did Disney buy dragon age? OR Do I have to wait for some realistic or DA:1 graphic like mod?
WHY IS IT SO PURPLE?
Why so cartoon graphics? I saw gameplay and reminded mee at gow
Why have they changed the Qunari into Handsome Squidward?
What did I just watch lol. This is the trailer? Looks like a mediocre fan vid
Dragons are ok, but what kind of spiders does the game have? 😅
why is there 0 audio mixing, all of the voices sounds like they are in a studio, no echoes no bouncing off walls, it sounds like they are all in the same small room
This guy at 1:14 looks sexy. Will I be able to romance him instead of that granddaddy-our-companion?
1:59 voice acting works well, looks very cartoonish though. What was this pause fade out in a trailer? did you cut out the boring gameplay in the thing that is supposed to get me excited? XD Maybe when it drops to <$10 i'll try it out
The dialogue is so stock, did anyone actually write any of it or was it just lifted from a pile of cliched lines?
how can after the first flawless game they keep getting much much worse like this ..huge downwards spiral
is there top surgery scars for the dragon? because u know there are two dragons, so surely one of them are LGBTQQIP2SAA right?
You guys remember dreadwolf?
Is there no lock on or did they just forget to use it during this video? Half the dagger and orb attacks missed because they weren’t target locked
stoked about the wardens, but what about antiva?? maybe zevran comes back?
What the fuck is up with these bot comments? You‘re telling me every other upload got rightfully shit on, but here everyone is positive about it?   Bioware and EA shamelessly faking good reception wtf
Did Gil summon Darkspawn FROM THE GROUND?!?!?!?!?!
What have you done to the dragon designs? The traditional look from DAI and before was so good; these look like mutants. Gameplay actually looks good though.
Watered down Hakkon?
What are those ice effects at 3:05??? Little cartoon snowflakes? How cheap is that? This game looks at times so cheap and amateur ...
Is this like a new Indie game spinoff? Looks like a Sims expansion
I have to ask, is the crossbow ever going to come back as a weapon? 😳
Why are the incels so sad and butthurt over this game? if you don't like it you could just move on and go do something else, but they are absolutely obsessed.
why do all the female characters look like they are dudes. they all have no chest.
What pronouns does the dragons use?
Why does it look like a ps2 cutscene
Is it just me or this game got downgraded? 🤣 Come on EA.....
Why does it look like a Sims game😂. This is Kingdom of Amular all over again
Is this fake or is this actually coming out
Is this shit a frigging mobile game?!?
They are wearing armor and using swords, and yet it doesn't give a medieval vibe. How did you mess that up?
I wonder how hard will the modern audiences will support this game.
what fu*k is it?
Why does everything have to look like freaking fortnite, dude? I swear....
Is this Dragon Age for gay toddlers?
Wtf is up with that dragon design??? It looks like something from How to Train your Dragon!
i don't why i didn't remember about it until now since it's such a big part of the DA universe, but where the hell is the chantry at? i haven't seen any chantry stuff in any of the trailers, gameplay, etc. maybe i just missed it but feels like it's been removed from this game
I really wonder who are those people who going to buy the game after this and previous trailers?
The characters are so ugly and off putting. Is that intentional?
What's the gender of the dragon?
that muscle bro walk tho at 00:22 is not promosing. Was there a choice for choosing feminine or masculine animations or is it shared across all characters?
I wonder how many bots will actualy buy this game, since modern audience is non existing...
Why to many bots commenting?
Why are there mastectomy scars?  And why are their heads gigantic?
Is Ghilan'nain suppossed to end us by laughter or why does she look so funny and goofy? "cOnSumE tHeiR fLeSh 🤪"
Your shit editing can be beaten by Lucypyre's editor   Why are the warriors coming with bucklers and shortswords at a snail's pace? The gameplay is still the same from Dragon age Inquisition  Who the fuck gave these people money?
Is this the surgery scars game?
Characters and dragon look pretty ugly if I’m being honest. Any chance these graphics are going to get fixed before launch or is this what we are stuck with?
Why do the Qunari look so stupid 😭
Why are the heads so fucking big? And why does the dragon look round and cherubic rather than angular and dangerous like a reptile predator?
what's with the ps2 era graphics?
ok so males are still idealized, but women have to look like shit? idk, it looks as if a team of body dismorphia dudes dressed as women are working on character design
Why does the dragon look so bad? Why are all the characters so weird looking and big headed? Thanks for letting me down after waiting years.
Are the dragons gay with surgery scars too?
Still not convinced this will be any good. Also, why is it more expensive on console than PC?
Is this going to be the game that finally kills bioware?
Is Bioware aware that all their thumbs up bots don't actually buy games?
So do you ever take damage in this game? That fight looked pretty easy lol
What’s the like to dislike ratio?
What are that's dragon's pronouns?
Not a very good dragon design.. But why the HELL do they have SOARS on their bodies??? Looks like shit!  Or STDs
Why so much purple? Also it still looks too much like fortnite character models. It's so jarring.
Is this a mobile game ported to PC?
Any chance of a Legendary Edition? I have problems importing my xbox360 savefile
Hello, Can we choose the hero's appearance from the release date trailer? I'm specifically talking about this hero's appearance: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8DkDQhPx2A&list=LL&index=3
Is Gendermancer a playable class and can I use the legendary weapon Estrogenblaster?
Is it just me or do the textures not seem quite right? Realistic layered on cartoony? Adds weird perspective to some of the scenes..
Are here a lot of bot comments? They don’t read as if they were actual comments of normal people.
Can someone convince me on this game? I think it looks pretty cool but i haven't been able to get into any of the previous games because i never liked the combat. It looks much improved in this game but i'm concerned i'll have no idea what's going on in the story
BOTS? OR DELEting coments? lett me screen this xD, ugly dragonkins
Is all the storytelling like this?  Looks like DA for meatheads...
is it just me, or did all the spells feel... i don't know, weak? there was no oomhp or visual "flare"....
I know they are blighted dragons, but why are they so ugly?
So .... That's not an archdemon then?
Is there an auto battle option?
God, why did they decide to make this trash?
Is that Torchlight 5? Lol what a damn joke of a game.
Is this a mobile game? oh... whoops.  Keep botting losers.
This looks awfully bad. Why does it have Fortnite graphics? Why is the Dragon so ugly? Why does the Combat look so bland... sheesh
Trending with 86k views?
Why does it still feel like an eternity to wait!? I want it now!
I am so excited for this but why did they do the Qunari like that? They look so bad!
"blighted dragon" yeah that's called an archdemon? why are we now not calling things the name they've had for multiple games?
Why balista so close? Animation faces so poor.. but dragons cool and epic
Why would you position ballistas at point blank range!?
At first I was like...wait, why are the Wardens here for a dragon? Is this an Archdemon? No? Just a dragon? Then what the hell? And then, oh the goddess can summon Darkspawn. Fun.
Hmmmm... MORE spoilers but no information on exactly how the button combos work, exactly how the different game modes work, how healing works since "healing schools are back in the game", how to toggle the UI changes and how accessibility options work/what they do when toggled on and off/what KIND of accessibility you're offering... THAT is the information we're all waiting for.... since, you know, this game is supposed to be so very inclusive and a LOT of us with disabilities can't easily deal with overwhelming flash and bloom, information overload, overly bright colours and flashing effects, action combat, managing button combos on keyboards, and seeing certain colour combinations like GREEN, RED, PURPLE AND YELLOW!!!    Anything?? For the accessibility and representation?? Anything?? NO?? 😒
But why the pronoun shit?
Force "her" to land? Did they just assume that dragons gender? No wonder its pissed.
is this android game?
So what exactly are these dragons? Just random dragons or archdemons?
When will be sexy witches but not this freak show?
So who are the love interest? Also, do we get to see Dorian? I really want to see Dorian again.
Is it too late now just to adjust people head size 😅 they kindda look like bubble heads! apart from that, looks great! Can’t wait to play as a Spellblade mage!
This looks incredible! Is it going to be on iOS as well or just android?
Will there be dragon flying mechanics? Like in Anthem.
Can the Qunari look more shit? xD
Why did it start looking so cartoonish?
Only  6000 likes? Don't be so stingy with buying fake likes, EA!
Throughout the series I'm hunted by one question... Is Dragon Age or Dragon Hunt Age? 😂
They’re using AI?
This is good idea? too much spoilers
Guilleman? Are we about to see space marines stomp on Solas?😱🤣
Why they're all looks like transwoman???
I have yet to find any information confirming or denying this question of mine: will the game be available in a physical PC copy? I have my little shelf of DA games with physical PC copies and was hoping to continue the tradition…
Ghilan'nain, looks more like a Darkspawn than an elf. Was she dug up and corrupted by the Darkspawn, similar to what happened with the Old Gods?
Are they actually gonna call her Gilla-nayn in the game? I thought that was just a mistake when I heard devs saying it.
looks terrible. so now that we're at the 10 year mark of DA:I and biowares decline, hows that "driving out the talented employees and hiring bums off the street to fill their positions" plan working out for you guys?
Since when has "Ghilan'nain" been pronounced like that?
Is this Erika Ishii's voice? I've been dying to her the fem US voice.
Guys the game looks brilliant but why is it not available for preorder for console in india ? the wait is tormenting.
Ok, so from a tactical point of view, if you know a dragon's lair is in a old tower, why would you set up balista 10 feet from the entrance? I feel like in most of the Grey Warden clips I've seen, their tactic is to either line up or group up and wait to get murdered.
Were those Grey Wardens I just saw? They're still around?
combat is good, really good.....BUT WHAT IN THA HELL IS THIS GRAPHICS ? the characters look horrible...the head is TOO big...the qnari horns are terrible...omg...
what is happening to our beloved IPs? Fable/ Dragon age/ Star wars (outlaws), they are being bastardized to maximize profits by getting the gen Z kiddos interested. pretty soon ill be lucky to have one major release per year that cares about mature adult gamers
Is it me or was the dragon kinda of, slower than the dragons in the previous installment? I remember in DAI they mention they used feline movements when hunting to mimic for their dragons, did they change the formula? Idk just seem kind of rigid for me
Great video, great pictures! Is there a photo mode in Dragon Age: The Veilguard? 😍
Is that a singularity? When did they discover Biotics?
Why you fucking with Corius for?
Pre-ordered, payed off, and request approved for nov 1st off im set. Just need to be patient.............is it out yet? 😂
What do you think of the worst design the Qunari chick , the dragon or, the dark spawn.
WHY DOES THE METEOR SPELL LOOKS SO LAME AF? THE ATTACK SPELLS LOOK STRAIGHT OUT OF A MOBILE GAME. WTF HAPPENED TO DRAGON AGE?!?!?!
Any info about how it runs on the base ps5? Like 1440p 60 fps? 1080p 60 fps? How much of a graphical downgrade is it from the pc? It's weird that we didn't get any information on that yet...
Mass Effect Fantasy. So where is Dragon Age?
Why not in 60fps, is it 30fps on console
If I ask nice can I have the game now? 🥺🥺
Will we PLEASE get a video that features the American accent Rooks 😭 we’ve gotten so little, even from the content creators…
Is that Alistar on the Ballista? I'm super excited to play this game after my exam!
Can we please have this clean UI instead of the one shown before?
Why does everything look so goofy in this game?  Art style is throwing me off.
I wonder if that warden is Alistair....
are these two dragons the last 2 Archdeamons?
Why does the Qunari warrior look half fantasy half trans.
Why are the heads so big  do the developers need to compansate anything ?
Wow did we just see the graphics and animations of hmm 2016? It’s not even 2014+ - it’s not for nothing that the game was made for so many years
Who's here before Asmongold's Darkspawn (fans) get here?
what was the point of constructing balistas right outside of watchtower when they know well that it's too close?
Soo did you guys turn down the particle effects? because I approve of that the last trailer with gameplay was deleting my eyes. At least one more thing that bothers me less.
Ummm is that a REAPER???
Environment design is pretty bad. This builds no atmosphere. Is the memory budget that bad?
IS IT HALLOWEEN YET!?
Dragon Age is soulslike now? It's so over...
Ghilan’nain romance when?
whats this quality of animation? - PS2??
If this is the spoiler stuff they are comfortable showing us just what do they have up their sleeve?!
Is that Evka in the beginning???!!!
Anyone else notice the Qunari actually looked normal here? And the gameplay looks insane!
Is it the 31st yet!?!❤❤❤
Can you fix the smooth Qunari please ? Thanks
Why doesn’t the dragon have top surgery scars? That’s not very inclusive 😢
You've heard of first dragon, yes - but what about second dragon??
