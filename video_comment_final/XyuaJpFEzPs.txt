Hello, I already picked intrest in you but how can we get in touch?
My question is why didn't the police arrest them? 😂
Who is in charge of this country?
Abawuturwa means what?
Why did arrest a soldier that has brought a suspect
But how can the entire police station miss to have security cameras?
What is the root cause of this! Please tell us.
But what kind of impunity is this?
Which police is this who didn't have bullets to shoot
Has anyone claimed responsibility for the attack?
Are we heading towards a state of anarchy?
Which party of Documentary is that????!!!
Where is Muzeeyi Bosco??
Can't police leave SFC to do everythg and police closes up states for them
