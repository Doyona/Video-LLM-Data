What's the name of the first song please ? Love it ❤
seems like he does most of his best work in transistion. Would he still be effective in a team like arsenal that holds a ton of possesion?
We need a striker who can score nearly 20 goals a season for us. Can he do that?
Where’s his van bastenesque goal?
Genuine question, what happens with G.Jesus? Presuming just rotating?
Has it been confirmed though? Cos i thought he was going to ac milan?
has he signed? or is this just another video to stink up arsenal searches on youtube
Is this confirmed??
He looks sick. But will he be a 20-goal-a-season striker?
Already have Havertz seems like a similar player?
the new Scamacca?
How is Arsenal going to play him and Havertz?
