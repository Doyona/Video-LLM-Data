Is there another fan of Real Civil Engineer? With all those bridges, you should've called yourselves the Engineers.
35:20  Chill with the bridges G xD ever since bread bridge really?
5:10 is that a spawn egg? lmao
What about the freeloaders
34:17 the random person falling out of the sky?!

47:35 Why does Grian have a spawn egg?! Did I miss something?

Man I need to try this out in Minecraft now. I’ll figure it out. Hopefully. Actually does anyone have the command block for this? Or is this a mod?
why is there a skeleton spawn egg in grians inventory?
Why does he have a spawn egg
You could be called the bridge boys maybe?
Ok actually what is a spanner and a plonker?

Does Grian know what chasing the dragon means?
Why is no hermit craft being posted? Did the season end so fast?
Anyone else waiting for the next episode to come out?
30:04 Would cherry-flavoured Wotsits be a good idea, or a bad idea?
31:53 I know Grian made the season, but can someone explain why he needs a spawn egg?
actually though? I miss hermitcraft

was the skin clue because of mumbo's waffle? lol
I'm so curious about the skin "hint," like, what does it mean???
What’s with the spawn egg? 2:31
Did anyone else hear the faint scream as skizz died 😂 Edit: after further watching the video i see that skizz died more than once. Rip 💀
Am I the only one seing a face in the base???
how does Grian have a spawn egg?!
Is the wither effect not included with this wildcard because I'm surprised nobody got it while testing foods and I'm surprised nobody died from it
Whats the spawn egg at 12:55?
Why does Grian have a panda spawn egg?

How are we like 6 seasons in and the colours are still not colourblind friendly?! Grian. Green, Lime Green and Yellow look the EXACT same for me and Red only looks slightly different. Use Yellow, Blue, Black, White, etc for very different colours
can i just ask what the spawn egg is about?? i dont remember him getting it or what it would be for and nothing was said about it so im a little confused
I wonder how the theme song is going to be.
Just out of curiosity, why or how does grian have spawn egg?
why can't the wildcards be like... randomly picked? like 30 wildcards 1 is picked like each episode and it's picked randomly wouldn't that work?
Could there be a boogie man tag as a wildcard ? Even pore paranoia for the spanner’s 😂
Hi grian will u ever bring back build swap?
Why does Mumbo have grians waffle?
Why does Brian end up with bridge builds? 😂😂😂😂 first bread bridge, now tribridge
Where did you get the spawn egg?
What happened to hermitcraft
35:30 what about bread bridge from limited life?
Cool idea: At the finale episode, you could bring all of these wildcards back but like they all happen at different times in the season but they stack?
Did anybody else notice at 34:16 somebody just falls from the sky in the background 😂😂
Will the life series shop be reopening with this series at any point? I would love to get myself some more merch 👀
Grian, there was an internet cut-out where I live. Do you think they are connected?
Am I the only one who noticed the skele spawn egg in grian's inventory the whole time?
is there a place to download the modpacks used in the life series, so this can be organized with friends ?
Why is there no boogyman? I think that's why everyone is so chill.
Why does he have a spawn egg ??
What if the final wild card.. is ALL of them in one
"Scar, what are you doing??" "Building a rollercoaster!! 😃"
How long has mumbo had a waffle?
Can someone tell me why the default fps for this video was 230?
42:47 he has a spawn egg?
Does mumbo also have an waffle on the back or has that just always been there?
Is the next episode going to be unabridged?
Eating well, or hardly eating?
Hear me out.. how about randomized inventory space??😮   As soon as the wild card is picked, items speu out of peoples inventory. And every few minutes, it randomizes again!
Mumbo "should we put something underneath it like a dangly bit?" How about clay balls?
30:00 why does he just have a skeleton spawn egg???
is there going to be  a new hermit craft video soon? (no hate just wondering!!)
2:43 is that a spawn egg in your inventory?
I’m kind of worried as I watch this season that Jimmy isn’t going to be first out, what are the fans gonna do when that happens…?
Who tf is the sugarplum fairy?
Is it just me or did anyone else see a face in the bridges? Typical Grian building 36:26
“Wanna smoke?” Most British thing grian has asked mumbo
How about every session you add a word to your group name? Current name: Sub-1 Spanners.
Why not change your group name every session? 😂😂😂
Why does mumbo have a waffle?
What about hermitcraft?
33:22 so they also have some spawn eggs? like loot from chest i guess?
who is the sugar plum fairy
35:21 what about bread bridge in limited life? That was a lot of bridge lol
26:47 how does he have a spawn egg?
Grian can you build on the next Hermitcraft season a mega base like season 7?
Is this subtle hints at what game Grian is gonna play next with a group of friends??? More iconic duo: Grian and Don’t Starve Together  😂😂😂😂😂
33:39 spawn egg in inventory???
Do you know what this needs? A BRIDGE REVIEW
are these bridges also justa. decoy?? always a good season when a bridge is involved!
About 18 minutes into the video, why did you have a skeleton spawn egg in your inventory?
It was too late yesterday so I couldn’t watch the whole live stream will the whole stream be up on VOD or?
what happened to hermitcraft?
why aren't you using bundles?
Skeleton spawn egg? In inventory
Why the Life series always remind me of adult swim? No matter what pov i watch. I love this.
How does grian have a spawn egg at 31:16?
Grian why do u have a skeleton spawn egg? 21:14
Grian why do you have a spawn egg in your inventory???? 🤨
What if, and hear me out, every episode you all just add another name to your group. For example, you guys can now be known as the Sub One Spanners rather than just Sub One or just Spanners?
Did Mumbo always have waffle hair?
I wonder if this works in real life?
Wait if Grian and Scar are so close together, does that mean Desert Dou might be in this series?
29:54 im not sure if you are supposed to have a skeleton egg ??
Where is the boogeyman?
50:06 grian has the “plonker” pass?🤨
Who’s watching in 1945?
25:00 why is there a random spawn egg in Grians inventory? HMMMM? And why is it a Skeleton spawn egg?
why does mumbo have a waffle excuse me
Also what is it with Grain and bridges??😂😂
Randomized crafting is an idea, not sure if its a good one. But it's an idea.  Another thought would be playing with the number of hearts everyone has, maybe increasing them the fewer lives someone is on and decreasing them for people with more?
Is keep inventory on?
Is anyone noticing the monster spawner egg at 10min in
... Grian just has a slight advantage over the wildcard information?
Did anyone else notice that Grian had a (Skeleton?) Spawn egg for the whole session? Im not sure if i forgot something from last time or not.
Sorry why does Grian have a spawn egg?
whjy is keep inventory on?
4:48 as a pastime activity perhaps?
Every time a spanner dies, build another bridge?
5:12 hollup, Mumbo is onto something "What?"
What is this seed? I really want to build your base is. I had an idea for a mine shaft.
Can you do a wid card that doubles graviity(can only jump half a block and fall damage happens with half as much of blocks and so on
34:18 am I the only one who saw someone in the distance fall from the sky? lol
Ok what’s with the spawn egg in Grian’s inventory?
Okay who wants to bet Skizz is gonna die first this season?
when does the fighting start?
At 13:25 , why does he have a skeleton spawn egg???
Potential future title: Wild Life: Episode ??? - Burning Bridges
Isn't a spanner a wrench?
what happened to the nice subtitles :(
34:17 Does anyone else see that?
43:21 the what now Grian?
Am I the only one who thought they were calling themselves the "Spaniards" for most of the video? They're British!!
Is this a bread bridge callback 🤔
What is up with hostile mob spawn?
Who the Sugar Plum Fairy?
anyone know who they would predict how many sessions there are to make the right amount of twists?
Should someone tell Skiz that spanner is British for wrench (aka: tool)? Maybe THEN he’ll appreciate the genius of the name.
How is Grian's episode longer than Mumbos's if he was mining for HALF AN HOUR?!
is this what the hunger games is about?
Why is the video sped up?
The suger plum fairy?
When are u posting on hermitcraft season 10?
How was there so much death this session and none of them was Jimmy!?! The curse better get its @$$ in gear or he might actually win this time.
Wait what happens to hermit craft?
5:28 he has a spawn egg?
Why is it that these three can get stuff done solo but when they’re together, they have sub one braincells?
Why was this upload so far after mumbos?
21:52 how did you get the egg?...
What if a wildcard was fishing could give you other Minecraft items ? Like sugar cane ,stone,iron?or basically anything
Why do they keep making things out of wood?
Wildcard idea: Is the sun gone? - It's permanently midnight after the wildcard is active.
Did I just see Grian have a spawn egg?
Did grian just give us a fake ad at the end…?
20:16 why does grian have a spawn egg?
I don't suppose it's possible to get these as a standalone datapack kinda thing? I'd love to try and do just a normal minecraft playthrough with food like this changing every couple in game days or whatnot.
So uh, how does grain have a skeleton spawn egg? He’s had it for the whole video 33:39
How is the meeting room not the shape of a spanner head? A move only a bunch of spanners could make.
Alright, let's get the predicitons up. What is next sessions wildcrad gonna be?  I'll guess that players are randomly gonna swap postions at certain intervals.
5:18 care to explain what a ‘cheese dream’ is?
No merch yet?
4:30 Anyone know where the spawn egg came from?
30:25 how dos he have a spawn egg?

Why grain have mob egg?
Who still remembers the bad boys?
Ok really what spanner means in england ? 😂
I wonder what the twist is
What if every block mined adds a “miner” amount of speed.
Love the vids <3, but is hermitcraft continuing during the life sires?
(idea) hot potato? every 15 minutes 3 random poisoned items will be chosen, if a player has them in their inventory, they will get withering 1, chests in which these items are contained will drop all items on the ground if the items are not removed within 15 minutes
hmmm... Mumbo doesn't have the grey streak in the Life Series?  So it's a Hermitcraft storyline?
0:26 Why does he have a spawn egg?
what if damage was randomized? imagine oxidized copper dealing 19 hearts of damage but a diamond sword dealing 2
Why doesnt Mumbo want to change your team name from sub 1 club to sub 1 intelligence club?
Could you add the boogyman? That was my favorite and it would definitly fit the haloween season
Why does Grian have a spawn egg lol
Something I could have missed but still want to know do the wild cards stack?
If you’re reading this comment, which YouTubers’ pov(s) are you watching?    I’ll go first:  Grian Mumbo Jumbo GeminiTay Smallishbeans LDshadowlady
Who thinks Mumbo is going to kick Grian off the team with everything that's happened XD
How about instead of being called something new each episode, what if you guys ADDED to the name. For example, "The Sub-One Floaters", or "The Sub-One Spanners".
Did anyone else see the two people in the back ground falling down at 33:52?
Is the game laggy or the video or my cell phone? God😢
How did 50000 people watch this video in 52 minutes
The sugarplumb fairy... is this a Crown of Candy reference? :D
35:27 BAD BOYS BREAD BRIDGE MENTION??????  edit: 44:01 BREAD BRIDGE EXPLICIT NAMEDROP
Are we allowed to suggest wildcards? It would be cool but it might take awhile to implement
39:40 Why does Grian have a spawner egg?
What if every few episodes had a wildcard which had permanent effects.  Like if, for example, you stayed the height you were at the end of the first session
Did anyone else notice the spawn egg in grians inventory?
Did no one notice that spawn egg in grians inventory
Sugar plum fairy??
Who up rn watching this
13:26 why does he have a skeleton spawn egg?
why does grian have a panda spawn egg?
Does anyone know if the Life Series Merch store is going to open up again??
I am the only one who keeps forgetting they can shift near edges now and is panicking everytime they get close?
Wildcard idea: Is the moon big?   After the wildcard is activated, the moon begins growing at a rapid pace, causing low gravity and tremors throughout the world
Why do I feel like Mumbo is going to become a hermit living in a small cave paranoid… Wait he already is-
surely the no-longer Sub Ones still stay together…right???
where is the hermit craft episode
2 minutes ago? I was hoping for 10 seconds.
1st? Perhaps i am and perhaps im not. What does it mean to be first? A question man asks its God everyday
