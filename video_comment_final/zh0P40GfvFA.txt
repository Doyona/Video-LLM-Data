hey yo, didn’t you do that song called “slv t me out”??
Bro wtf is this? Yall like this type of sht? We cooked
Was that meant to be nba 💀
Can people stop saying he sampled “hit em up” by tupac. Eric b & rakim used the beat first on “paid in full”. And they sampled  it from Dennis Edwards “dont look any further”
Bro who tf call Tupac??
Who’s gonna tell him ts buns?
maybe i’m out the loop but when they start beefing ?😅
idk the context so i’m just like damn… what did that nigga do to make the gooch monster so mad?
where is his outfit from?
So nobody caught the Zohran Mamdani reference here? South Africa is where Mamdani went to school and Uganda is where he was born, and now he’s the mayor of NYC. If you look at 2:08 you’ll see the two country flags, it could mean NLE shows his support to the new mayor, very subtle though, not many will catch that.
Bro, why are you being jealousy bro? You’re just jealous because young boy is going famous and you’re quiet, so maybe you should’ve made more songs and nobody really likes you. No more you you’re not even you’re not even trending. No more bro.
Who still listening in 2025?
What's with the other country flags? Is he trying to merge the other tribes into black American business like monaleo tried to do? I'm just wondering
Is this the next Michael Jackson?
What’s up with the checker board tho?
Ok , but why is he dancing ?
Honest question: Is he blaspheming? English isn’t my first language and especially with his accent I can’t understand everything perfectly. In the beginning when he’s running he says „YHWH“ in his breath which is the name of the Lord and later in 0:26 I don’t understand what he says about Jesus and the devil and someone who is king. Can someone help? Hope he’s not trying to make fun of Jesus! God bless
Was he dissing NBA Yb?
Why the South African flag ? Just wondering
Why would NLE Diss YB
Is he on drugs 😳
What in the ripoff Tupac is this 😂
Why he drop that wack ahh song😂
Young Boy where is the big boy ? 😂😂😂
Can anybody here who's honest enough to admit that they're an NBA Youngboy fan tell me how you think NLE the Great  isn't the better lyricist and overall artist?   I don't listen to today's young from-the-streets rap artists because quite frankly their music is trash and (NBA Youngboy is the most absolutely overrated artist that I'm aware of), so I wasn't familiar with NLE the Great either, but I can say he puts thought into his lyrics and in this video he showed fearlessness in expression.   I will never understand what the noise around NBA Youngboy is all about.
What the actual heck did I just watch!
Wtf is this 😂 a 1960s version of hit em up ? Sound and production is legendary!
What does young boy gotta say tho ? 😂 This shits hard af 🎉

Am I right in saying this feels like hopsin flow ?
How you make a Diss acting zest in the video? I guess it worked.

What the hell is this song about?
Hold up this might be me, but does anyone else sorta hear the beat to "Hit 'Em Up" by 2pac? Rhythmically I keep picking it up and sometimes the flow begins to match. NLE really is on another level Edit: Played the 2 back to back, yeah, that bassline was most definitely inspired by or taken from Hit 'Em Up.
Why is it 2hours long😢😢 still can't get enough
Have you heard these lyrics?  I would say....listen again.
youngboy really aint replyin??
Is he gay? The song is aight but this might be the gayest video I’ve seen. I don’t understand what he’s trying to do
I came looking to see if the video i saw was fake and this even worse is he SERIOUS?

I'm lost.....is this a diss or a parody?🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Personally, I think the music video and song are creative and catchy. But one thing I have to ask — does it glorify God? Bro doesn’t believe Jesus Christ is God — the King of Kings and Lord of Lords — and this song, like his last one, is a reflection of that. There’s no Holy Spirit behind it. Take the message how you will. May the Lord remove the scales from his eyes, mine, and all of mankind’s.
Is this parody I’m confused
Why ts hard😭?
What the fu k is that
Am I the only one who wants to see how he would do on film? He’s so animated and high energy, he’s fun to watch. Rap wise he uses real words so I love it…
