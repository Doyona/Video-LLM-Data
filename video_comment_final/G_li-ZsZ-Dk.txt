Wait, wasnt there a wedding of your brother the previous vlogs as well? Sorry if i'm confused. 😅
Oh, they have 2 weddings? This is the 2nd one right? And congratulations to your brother, best wishes for them! 🥰🫶🏻
Thank you for the video :) Have you seen a doctor about your experience on your period? It might be a good idea to rule out any potential underlying issues, because your experience seems more horrible than normal. Or they might have suggestions for how to treat the intensity of your symptoms. I'm so sorry you're going through that!!!
Your younger brother is getting married again? (ik the youngest-babyangle isn’t getting married) 13:42
