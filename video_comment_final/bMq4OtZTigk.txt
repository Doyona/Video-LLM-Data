Will there be transgender NPCs? Asking for nefarious reasons
Is that the i-4 eye-soar @ 4:35 ? 😂
What do you think we need for the max graphics and high fps requirement of gta6
Looking gorgeous and I can't wait for the release date but the big question - will my humble PC with a Ryzen 5700+RTX 3060ti and 32 GB of RAM be able to run this game or will I need to upgrade to a much more powerful CPU ?
What if Tommy Vercetti had a son, and that son fights to reclaim his father's lost drug empire? With the help of some old friends from Vice City.
Who is here after trailer 2!!

Do you know why are you here ?   "Just watched trailer 2 I guess..

Should the "ida" in Leonida" be pronounced the same as the one in "Florida"?
Maybe 200 to 500 GB total game size for this game?
Series S??? I don’t think so
Why do you think Waezle news is a parody of Fox news when the theme is white and red ? CNN is white and red.
Anyone else mad they do not include skateboarding or rollerblading??? Shii even throw in scooters 🛴
not American, but almost every word with leo in it, followed by a consonant is pronounced as "Leh",  right? you even got Leonard County (leh nard). isn't it possible Leonida ( especially with Florida being a 3 syllable word as well) is pronounced as "Leh Nida" or even "Leh Nuh Da" like "Floh Ruh Da" ? havent heard anyone say it like that yet, but it seems like a possibility.
Will cleetus mcfarland be in this game ?😂

Who else saw Jason's car in the dirt bike scene
.... So now can we get new GTA V single player content? A few new clothes? Some hair styles? Some new activities like arm wrestling? Maybe a night club for single player? What about the casino interior and single player gambling??  Something???! Anything??!!!!!
Runnin down a Dream a vice city soundtrack? Have you ever played GTA VC? This Song was in San Andreas... K-DST...  not professional...
what if this is a reverse gta 3 story line where "claude" loves interest sells them out ... just reversed you know "Me too" 2023
Chop wasn't in gta 5 was he? He was in San Andreas
gta 5 and and red dead 2 was build on the same multiplayer logic, riddled full of hackers that made online unbearable. Is that addressed in gta6 or are they just going to continue to pretend like it's not so and build of the same stuff?
when they in bed together, which character are you 😂
Did yall see Denice 🤣🤣🤣🤣
How much will a psp CD cost maybe $1700US

yo chat how much will gta 6 be?
will the game exclusive again on ps5? or in all platform
Great breakdown... But pibwasser? 😊
why don't they use real brands and charge companies for that?
Ok are we certain that we are playing as both characters?! Because we don’t know the guys name and he doesn’t seem to be of super great importance this far yes he’s in the trailer multiple times but I’m starting to think maybe we will only be playing as Lucia.
So, are we gonna be forced to play as a female? also no mountains, completely flat terrain it seems.
10:50 Is that a pink Ford Crown Victoria?
what is the point of a trailer when it is not out for so long
Why wpuld the apartment complex only be available on gta 6 online ? One of my major gripes with the gta 5 story mode was not being able to buy property
Did somebody forget the dodo in GTA 3? 😮
Will Sheriff GRADY JUDD be in the game to do his wanted announcements?
What if theres no gun stores like GTAV but a guy who sells guns in GTAIV since lucia has a criminal record and cant be caught up again
4:31 is that supposed to be Ricardo Milos on the left?
is this gonna be on ps4 ?
Is the freedom factor on the map??
Are those kids playing in the mud in the background??? 13:51
15:00 Hellcat challenger cop car? (Gauntlet Hellfire)
16:11 Are we assuming the games in the games get sequels more than once every ten years?
Is though Lucia's boy friend was named Jason because we already knew Lucia's name for like almost a year now
So does that mean you gotta play as a woman aswell? 😢
We got a gta6 teaser trailer breakdown before gta6?!
how is wezel news a parody to fox news? im confused all it says is news and that makes it similar to fox news? lol this guy is a bit of a dumbass
how does a black man with a bandana tease asian gangs in GTA 6?😂😂😂
What if you can actually go to jail for your crimes in GTA 6 ?  THAT’D BE CRAZY! 👀🔥
Is it just me that wants some of the old radio stations to come back for nostalgia purposes. It would be cool if radio channels work in the same way the real world does, based on where you are on the map you're able to pick up certain radio channels.
Why does the voice of the narrator sound just like that dude from the cannabis News Network on YouTube
Isn't the male protagonist named Jason based of the leaks? That's also how we found out Lucia's name as well
is Lucia the only protagonist?  or they’re two and are switchable?
Question is.. Can we, hopefully, bring our gta v online character over to Vice City?
You can’t play male characters?
Anyone notice the green Chrysler 300  srt ? 😮‍💨
Thought 'Running down a dream' was San Andreas?
Why tf you called it a dodge charger when it's clearly a challenger
Who else noticed the "Sunpass or Toll By Plate" on the highway sign?
Yay single mom simulator!!!! Do we get our foodstamps on the 5th every month in game?
Are those kids in the background wrestling in the mud at 13:51 ???
Anyone else notice the Miami Heat arena when Lucia was going wild on the highway ?
Cool they got a Peruvian & Haitian flag, but no Cuban flags … in Miami (Vice City) ?
Do you think the Sky Wheel from Miami will be in GTA 6
wonder if we can play as the male too?
Why 99? Why not 100??
crocodiles?! bro c'mon, they're gators
2:32 a callback to gta 6 roots?
lol why you pronounce brickell like that?
Is this just cinimatics? Or gameplay?🤔🤔🤔
In the Wezel news clip you can see someone lost their swimming shorts due to a waterspout, could this mean we have full blown weather systems like tornados and hurricanes? We had a Hurricane in the first Vice city, would be amazing to see one fully ramped up in the current gen.
The scenes at 14:38, 16:54, 17:30 an 18:10 could be all the same (first?) mission, a robbery on the Uncle Jacks store? Same car, same outfits, same bandans same day time.
PiBwasser? That character is pronounced as an S. I think you may have missed a joke!
What's the BGM name during 16:10-16:52?
What about cheat codes
How are any of these "hidden details" when they literally put them in the trailer?
Why is everyone ignoring green Lamborghini at 8:28
will Tommy Vercetti return in GTA 6?
are we sure we are not playing in the real world?
How many characters are playable?
Hold on, theres bermuda triangle on the map???? Ahhh some easters
Maybe Andrew is the president?
why Florida becomes Leonida, weird naming.. 😅
Wasn't the dodo in GTA 3 as well?
anyone else think they released a trailer too soon? We gotta wait two moree years now like wtf
What’s to say these are not pre generated?
Would this work on my xbox 360?
Is that a SKY TOWER(middle left) in the opening scene?
broooo they even got the bridges in the keys right. they gots that old bridge right next to the old one just like in real life‼️‼️2025 THO?!?😫😭
Will there be planes in GTA VI?
At the gas stations, you can see the npcs lined up to pump gas… possible fuel mechanic?
Can we talk about even smaller details? Like the sand on the people’s feet at the beach 4:05
Why are PC players discriminated against?
What parts of this preview show the actual gameplay versus flashy looking cut scenes?
Years ? We waited over a decade .
What are the PCs minimum specs for gameplay?
Wasn't 'running down a dream ' in San Andreas not vice city?
Only 99? Pathetic
13:51 are those kids in the background playing in the mud??
When are people gonna wake up to this, they are literally showing you what you've ALREADY SEEN and have got 1.4M views from it. Wake up ffs.
Already?? bro the trailer just came out yesterday there is no way you made this video about 99 details about GTA 6 trailer 😭😭
do we have play as the chick?
Will we need better consoles for this game
can someone explain the clips that they are copying around the 10 minute mark?
How do you get 99 details out of 90 secs of a trailer😂😂
The girl at 9:43 is Eva Mendes… Right?
In the Wezel news clip you can see someone lost their swimming shorts due to a waterspout, could this mean we have full blown weather systems like tornados and hurricanes? We had a Hurricane in the first Vice city, would be amazing to see one fully ramped up in the current gen.
This is a reach.. but what if that beware of dog sign is a hint that Franklin is in the game. Possibly in that cop raid mission. Maybe he gets arrested ??
Could arrest Andrew be a reference to the Zimmerman case?
lol why did he pronounce brickell like brick-L? You can tell he’s never stepped a foot there.
8:40 is that a cop driving an aventador?
But where is sprunk? @sonnyevans
This voice is familar sounding??
Why does nobody seem arsed we still have to wait more than a bloody year other than me
Are we not in the 4k universe yet? He keeps referring to it as the HD universe. I'd say GTA4 and 5 are HD universe. We out of that now
How does this look more intricate then gta 5 apart from graphics
So does this game take place like in the 2020’s?
The different coloured maskes both wear while robbing the gas Station. Whats up with that?
Does anyone know if this is actually in game footage or not...
8:34 DODGE CHARGER!?!?!?
Yall gone break down trailer for the next year an a few months?
Is there even 99 seconds worth of runtime in the trailer?
Why nobody noticing the razor/polaris looking vehicle in the mud pit?
So are we playing as a girl?
DID YOU KNOW???: There will be at least 3 different types of guns im GTA VI all of which are confirmed to shoot bullets
Why is it always cali or Florida....  Make one for ny or Philly or some 💩
17:08 pibwasser... really? that is spelled pisswasser, in german it means pisswater... and i'm not even a german to know this...
13:50 are those kids in the back?
Where has the yacht at 19:14 come from? Did it go *through* the bridge?
8:36 Why does nobody know the difference between a dodge charger and a dodge challenger? They don’t even look the same.
When’s trailer 2 coming?
One big question: Will there be an honor system in GTA 6 like in RDR2?  After red dead redemption 2 we definitely saw some compatibilities between GTA and RDR. like the epsilon cult and rdr2's mysterious cult.
did any notice Lucia weight change? HMM
Y’all more excited about story mode or online ?
How many protagonists?
Wasn’t running down the dream on San Andreas not vice city?
Why is it in GTAonline a majority of the modders/hackers are in the IGN crew? 🤦‍♂️🤣
Did anyone notice when they kick the door into rob the shop she’s not wearing her ankle bracelet, maybe that’s how the game starts 18:10
Will it run on Steamdeck? 😅
8:36 dodge what?
How can this guy breakdown every single thing my goodness.
Why are we being forced to play as a female is bad enough? We have to make these choices while playing c o d
Are they going with multiple playable characters like in GTA5?
Gotta Love the reality improvement but dude, isn’t it too graphic to take your car and run over all that beach people just like in any other gta ? Idk
Amazing breakdown. Isn't the male character named Jason?
In the states whats the difference between a police officer and a sheriff?
So has there since been any new info on that "dolls of destruction" website that poped up? Is that real/related to the ingame band shirt?
What if........this trailer is just showing us more of Lucia and her partner and a glimps of VC and Leonida.  The next trailer will showcase Jason and more of VC and Leonida.(or whatever his name will be) That would be cool.
You couldn't make it to 100?
What do you mean it's not clear who the bikini girl is? It's Lucia lol plain as day
How did you not note that the liquor store is based off of Flanny’s/Big Daddy’s? Massive Miami Culture.
NO PC RELEASE ARE THEY INSANE?
Wasn't "Running down the dream" in San Andreas, not Vice City?
5:46 aint that the Heat arena??? 🤔
I’m going to guess that the robbery we see in the trailer with Lucia and Jason is before she goes to jail as she doesn’t have the electronic tag on her leg yet as is shown in the key art. Maybe this is even part of the opening cinematic? It looks to me like all the scenes could be placed together in such a way that they start in the hotel/bedroom and then rob the store only to be chased by the cops and Lucia is then captured in a possible betrayal by Jason being the “bad luck” she talks about. Thoughts? 🤔
Is it just me or does Lucia's partner look a lot like Michael in the trusts scene?
Can anyone tell which edition of gta vice City is this 7;20 ?
Did IGN copycat Strange Man?
Why do we have to wait longer for the PC version though? It's actually not "unsurprisingly", it's highly illogical. Who cares about consoles?
Will they bring Opressor MK2 ?
Can they fix the inflation lol
Does this make it the first ever Billion dollar game?
Do you guys think we will get a hunger bar aswell as a health bar like we do in rd2? Would love to see like a burger shot or some kinda food place where we can eat, also love to see a gym and a strength bar where you can gradually build up from skinny to muscle over time by hitting the gym and fighting
Why are they pretending to not know who Jason is 😂
Isn't the bridge around 9:06 the one used in one movie with J L Curtis and Schwarzenegger about him being super secret spy?
13:56 with the ThrillBilly mud club, you can see children playing to the left of the screen. So does this confirm children will be in the game?
Interesting how you see a cargo ship actually sailing on the ocean, I've never seen that in a GTA, maybe they could be used to smuggle drugs? Or weapon shipments to earn cash
Crocodiles??? Florida is known for gators not crocs
Is this map already confirmed? Where did you get it from?
Is this a remake or continuation of the last ?
Why do pc get absolutely shafted
A part of me tells me Niko will be in this game or hinted towards him one way or another, didn’t Lester say he also went to vice city or either died?? One of the two?
where is the map at 3:22 and 5:28 from?
Anyone considered how much Lucia looks like Mary Linton?
why don’t they put real brand cars
how yall got 99 details and gameranx only got 20
isn’t it Sound4Round (Sound Around) at 16:30 ?
Can we fast forward through 2024?
They talking like she's the main character, is it not a two character game ?
Can we see Lionel Messi as he is a player of Inter Miami?
Anyone else see the resemblance between Jason and colt from ghost recon breakpoint?
PS5 and Series X only? No crossgen?
If this time NPC just doesn't spawn and they have their own character route that would be awesome. But the thing is are the hardware in that year ready for this?
When do we get to see gameplay footage ?
Do people really pronounce it PiBwasser? Hilarious🤣
At 2:38, wasn't the Dodo from GTA 3?
What happened to the twerking police
Will the the game fit my PS5 lol?
Did you really pronounce it piBwasser?!
My kids are gonna be like "what was it like in 20s Dad?"  Im literally gonna give them this game.
GTA 6? Sounds like a cool mod for GTA 5
Do we really not know Jason’s name is Jason?
Has anyone call the phone number thats on the pawn shop sign?
Where’s grove street tho ?😢
why is nobody mentioning that’s there is gonna be ambient lighting features in car customization
Did he just say Pibwasser? Hahah. It's pronounced Pisswasser which should give a hint as to what it means.
Is it me or the guy looks like Tommy?
Would we get a version for the PS4 Slim ?
So is it Jason and Lucia? Switching like in gta V or we don’t know yet
30 fps lock and no mods?  meh I'll wait for a normal version
Did anyone notice that Jason looks a lot like Arthur Morgan or niko bellic while he is in the car in that angle or that view 😮
Do guys think we are able to move our accounts over🤔
Is her partner not called Jason?
How many main characters are in the game?
Will we finally get the jetpack we all want
10:17 is it just me or it's ricardo diaz mansion/Vercetti estate on the background?
Do you think this will be 60fps?
Was that someone surfing in the beach scene to the far right when zoomed out ?
Alligators surely no?
How can you find details of a game that still haven’t decided what and how to make it yet
Is lucia the one on the bikini that posed?
Is it me or does the male protagonist resemble Jim Caviezel?
Is it possible for Rockstar to reduce the views over eighteen years old?
How could Michael Mann's Miami Vice be a key inspiration for the original Vice City when it came out years after the game??
Do we think there will be lots more interior environments?
Why apartment purchase only online? All purchase should be in story mode also
is this a game?
The clip was freaking 1 minute long, how yall seeing almost a 100 Easter eggs????
What stopped you at 99?
Why do you think that it's not just a cinematically enhanced version of the game? There is no statement in the video (like they usually do) that everything you see is in-game.
PiBwasser? My guy, that's a German Eszett. It's basically just two Ses. So, it's pronounced PissVasser.
I’m actually curious about the kids in the back of the thrill billy scene on the left. Is there gonna be kids in GTA6 or is it just a scene only thing?
The guns they use in the store in the final shot are interesting. the male guy's gun looks similar to GTA V's basic pistol, but Lucia's appears to have a Glock style gun. maying they remodeled the combat pistol from five to be a Glock?
Co-op??? The theme is "sticking together".
Still can't sync lips Seriously?
If lucia is in jail does that mean if we get arrested we might have to go through a rehab thing if we wanna get out and has to face devier constituency if we break out ?
Im excited about the game but the next thing im excited about is where is the next gta game gonna take place at? Texas? (Since they already have the map model from rd2) Washington? Chicago?
How does that Damn Radio Tower Survive all those Damn Hurricanes? 🤔
15:30 could it be that they’re poking fun at rappers who self snitch in their music? 😂
Let me ask you something; How do you KNOW, FOR SURE, of certain details you're mentioning without proper fact checking? How do you KNOW the prison staff member's name is actually Stephanie and not something else? Who told you this? You can't even read her nametag because of the resolution. Some of these "facts" you're telling us don't seem really factual...
Can it run gta VI. is gonna be the new thing 😭
Where are they getting this map from? Is this confirmed?
All of that in depth analysis and you get alligators wrong?
What happened to Tommy Verseti?
Michael Mann’s Miami Vice (2006) was a key inspiration for the original Vice City (2002)? What?
But isn't it render footage so details don't matter at all untile actual game play comes out ??
Why 69 when you can nine-one-nine? Man, I'm in love with GTA VI already, lol.
why aren't there more studios like rockstar? never plahed a bad rockstar gaem
Any news  about the crypto rumor that was floating around a couple months back?
Bonnie and Clyde type of story maybe? perhaps there will be split screen?
Who wishes that GTA 6 setting was set back to the 80s ?
Damn, what is Clint doing here? 😂
13:50 are those kids in the background????
Didnt the leaked gta 6 stuff we have seen months ago, show that we would get two main characters? This trailer kinda proofs that. Lucia and her partner.
Can we get a different rockstar game while we wait 👀
I've never heard the GTA universe refered to as the "HD Universe", where does that come from?
When does it GTA VI Arrive to PC?
Where is the oppressor mark 2
is the map you guys keep showing official or a speculated mock up?
8:36 So you just ignored that Lambo?
Bick-el? It's Brickell.
Anyone found Vic Vance yet??? Tommy Vercetti???
Why is weasel news? Akin to Fox News? I’m just curious.
Who else was kind of underwhelmed by the trailer?   Don’t get me wrong, I’m buying the game. Just asking
Did anyone notice the dodge challenger police trooper ? 15:00
What about GTA X (10)?
15:35  *Missed Detail* How'd you not mention the baby getting grabbed by a gator? lol
Why is it that I’m the only one that notices the children in the trailer lol.
