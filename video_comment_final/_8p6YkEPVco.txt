why not just make everyone zombies?
Am I the only one in the recent comments who liked S3?? 😂 I hated S2 so much that I wanted to give up but gave S3 a chance and I liked it. S1 & S3 are great. Not S2.
Should have end in season 2 idk why they are stretching, seems like another season is coming.
Why did Arisu magically become majestic
Is this is a final season
Can someone recommend a site or an app to watch for free I don't have Netflix
Why are u copy pasting squid game script like totally. They now make episodes on usa and you guys doing it too 😮‍💨😮‍💨
What Happened? Season 3 Completely Lost the Plot
But Season 3? It's baffling. It feels like whoever took over the writing just didn't know where to go with the story. The plot feels forcefully pushed and completely directionless, as if they desperately needed a reason to drag the characters back into the Borderland.
They milking ts?
Wher3 is chishya???
season 4 when?
Just finished it, it's good but i don't know what the point of this season , so can anyone tell me??
So basically like an inception concept where they go in deep sleep and then save each other ?

0:58 ok who the heck is this girl?
Idk why people keep talking about Squid Game... was Alice in Borderland ever an allegory for capitalism????
is that his brother? is he the joker?
I'm getting suspicious about Ryuji(the guy with the wheel chair) because the joker card likes playing twisted games maybe he is the joker? Because I think he will act as nice and innocent guy then there will be a plot twist that he is the  villain
Where is chishia ??????
what is the title of the music in the start? please answer
Wait so there really is no Chishiya and Kuina? I thought it was rumours 😭
Where's a guy with hoodies and hand in pockets ? 🥹
Fire Arrows, that was supposed to be the First game in the OVA anime right?
0:17 is he the guy on jack of hearts game? cuz aside from chischiya, there are 2 more who survived the game and if im not mistaken, yaba and banda was the name of the two.
Aguni and chishiya?? Ann is back why aren't they 😭😭

Is this based off of the sequel manga re:try?
Soo is that mean Banda is the main  dealer?
There is a salseman it's this game like squid game?
Why do I keep getting " Sword art online vibes + multiverse of madness vibes from this trailer ? 😂
Banda is The Joker ?
Where I can watch except Netflix?
so is the serial killer dude from s2 the joker? orrr…
Who is this clean man and where did Arisu go?
Anyone else annoyed they revealed the joker in the trailer?
Can someone read the manga tell me is this season a part of original story or its new written…
why are there doors/portals to other realities 😭😭i hope those details really make sense within the established universe of the borderland because if its just some random new thing i will kms💔
did they change the cast or just im tripping?
Why arise look is so change 😢
Is this another dream again? How am I to be invested if its not real?
who is the guy at 0:16? Is he the guy who decided to stay as the jack of hearts? The game that Chishiya played?

Where did the usual protagonist go???? 😮 💔
why is youtube waiting multiple days to recommend this to me bro
Why are they not speaking Korean anymore?

What about the ace cards
I don’t understand… are the games real? Are they in a simulation?? Was the meteor real ??? Like the Queen at the end of season 2 confused me even more bc she kept lying and going back and forth… where are Ann, Chishiya, & Kuina. I’m so losttt 😭😭😭 some help me pleaseeeeee

WHERE THE HELL IS EVERYONE???? ALL THE CAST FROM SEASON 2??? HELLO???
0:08 I saw the same clip in another trailer, is Arisu playing the Seven of Hearts game again??
What is this movie on
are they milking it?
So this is past the Mangas story?
Is it real that the season will only have 6 episodes?
When is the release date?
Where is chishiya???😭😭he is my fav character 😭😭😭
Am I tripping or they changed Arisu actor ???
Is chishiya not in s3??
Where is chishiya???????🙂
Did they take that one game from the anime version? I swear I saw those raining arrows before.
I thought the games weren't real, wasn't the whole thing like purgatory or something? I don't really remember because there were so many fake-out explanations last season I forgot which one was the real explanation
Is it different from the comic?
2:03 was that Arisu??
What do you think about the zombie card
Where is CHISHIYA???
why is kamen rider necrom here
Where is chishiya?
why only 6 episodes why rush it???
Why is this season looking more like Squid game 😅
Lmao this reminds me of sword art online when Asuna was trapped in ALO and Kirito went in to save her. Am i the only one?
I'm all for Ann😊 Edited: Curious, no og characters?
Did they seriously just spoil his death
What if chisiya be the joker? It would have been interesting
hmm i don't think the baby is a "real" baby. might be some kind of illusion, or a dream, anything that the Joker use to deceive Arisu for whatever reason. i don't think they fast forwarded that much to the point that Usagi even got pregnant, you know? pls I think the Joker is a cunning one anyway.
WAIT DID I JUST SEE ARISU DIE DUE TO THE LASER IN THE END?!?!!!!?!
WTH was the end!????
What date it will be featured?
How many games will there be??
The manga ending, was the same as s2, so is this just a TV adaptation spin off?
Where is Kuiana
WHERE IS OUR CHISHIYA? OUR KUIMA?
where is chishiya?
At 1:43 is that a zombie?
Why this long????😢😢😂

Did they change actors for Arisu?
WHERE IS CHISHIYA AND KUINA????????  WHAT THE ACTUAL FCK IS HAPPENING WITHOUT THEM??????

im sorry but wheres Chishiya? i know he die at the manga but come on!
Where is CHISIYA?
Will Usagi become her baby in a very short amount of time as well? 😂
Am I the only one who noticed they’ve put games from the manga they didn’t put in season 1? Like the game with gas masks or the one with fire arrows.
WHY IS NOBODY TALKING ABOUT 2:03 THATS DEFINITELY ARISU
Is this canon? Like does the manga has this story or they just wanna cash out on this IP bcoz squid game got so popular? 🤔
im actually confused, what "liquid" do you guys think she injected arisu? at the end of the video, he has the same polo shirt and  a clock ticking. I think that "two" minutes is the whole episode of season 3.
what kind of redcon will be at the begining
did i just see arisu die in the last frame??
I wonder that girl with blue hair, her calm and confident face tells that she might be a main character in upcoming season 🌟
Why did they shot  arisu in the last  I Can't see this 😭😭😭🔪
What? Why is the beginning literally just Squid Game?
Where’s Chishiya? 😢
OKAY WTF, DID ARISU JUST DIE IN THE END? HELLO, I DONT WANT TO CRY AGAIN.
What? Its not over? lol
Wait is chisiya not there in the season ?
why is there a season 3 when the manga ended at season 2???
Where is chishiya???😢😢
Who has d craziest game, squid game or Alice it’s close imo very close
Did they change the main lead?
" wheres  number 456 at?"
Where is chishiya ??
Are we not getting Chishiya and Kuina in season3? 😭
Weren't the games a part of his delusion? Is he in his head again for the 3rd season?
Yo since when did arisu get married?
Will the dubbed version be available on release day?
Where is niragi???
DID ARISU GET SHOT WITH THE LASE AT THE END WTF
Theres no All 4 Ace cards on S1 and S2. And also joker. So who's the real Joker?
how dare they didn't show chishiya?????????????? 😭😭😭
Did they hide chisiya?
I didn't watch S2, can someone give the recap and how it differs from the manga? cuz in the manga it ends when they got back, so I suppose I must know the lore from S2 LA before watching this
Where tf is chisiya?
Imagine someone gives birth and the man just Sacrifice himself just so the baby escapes?
Bro, did I just see a baby here?
Where is CHISIYA???????
What happened to bad posture final boss…

Is Arisu gonna be Gihun of September? 2:03
what is going on in this show😂
Is it true that Kuina and Chishiya won't be in season 3??? I'm going to cry if they aren't in it??? ALSO where are the rest of the previous cast? Is this season going to consist only new cast? I am already crying 😭😭😭 Thank God Ann is still here.
I thought this was over already in season 2? The manga is short as well and they already excluded a lot in season 1.
0:33 where it Joker Card?
What are they even adapting like what? For the first 2 seasons it was a good adaptation now there just dragging the show
how many episodes will it be?
Is it supposed to be the last season?
What if Arisu sacrifices himself to save Usagi in the end
Squid Game, who?
Damn!!.... where is chishiya????
Where is chishiya?
why are all these comments talking about squid games omfg it’s a different show please 😭😭🙏🙏
1:40 does anyone know what car they’re driving based on the interior?
Where tf is chishiya ?
Is this an original season between the sequel manga with Arisu?  Thought they would have adapted that, or the story with the female protagonists, but this looks uncharted territory.
Where the hell is chishiya?
Where is silver color hair
Where is Chisiya 😢
Arisu 's brother died?
Oh hey seems like they’re gonna use the 2 of ❤ from the manga ? I mean the shot in the metro with the mask, it’s gotta be that right ?   Maybe they’re gonna use all the games they skipped because they didn’t evolve alice in S1.
Can we uave a season 4 to bring bavk all the amazing actors from the first 2 seasons!!
S02 was good conclusion, why are we getting another Season?  I really love this series but looks to me like we'll take it the Squid games route and just ruin it
Where is chishiya ?
Was that aguni or is Niragi coming back lol what characters are
do not compare this masterpiece with Squidward game lol.. Back to trailer, whoaaaa so they remember the game???  And ngl never knew we actually will get a third season

where the fuq is  Chishiya  Kuina Aguni Niragi ?
Did y'all not see him getting lasered at 2:02?
is this from  the manga ?
Now there's a baby involved..? This is starting to scare me..
does arisu die in the end of the trailer
0:23, is that 2 of hearts? 1:16 What kind of good fortune bad fortune game ahh is that 1:38 I have a stupid feeling this is the final scene, where they've escaped and Arisu is contemplating his life choices of the borderlands whilst his brother holds the baby for the first time
bro wait, wasn't it all a gengitsu and now they awake ?
Is Alice in borderland basically squid game?
WHAT THE HELL IS HAPPENING

0:22 wasnt Ann supposed to be deaad? so either she is the joker or everyone that died in the games will be alive this season and will participate again or something?

Banda is the Joker?
WHERE THE HECK IS CHISIYA?

Why is this trailer on cinema quality?
Where the hell is chishiya??????????????????????
What if arisu & usagi's child also joined the game & for saving his own child,arisu gonna sacrifice his life bcz Netflix added a romantic angel of arisu & usagi,so it might be happen that we're gonna lose one of them😓💔
Chishiya? Kunia? Aguni? Niragi? 👀 either it's gonna be a huge surprise or a massive disappointment 😞
And like everyone's asking where's Chishiya?

WHERE IS CHISHIYA?

Why does Netflix seem so fixated on showing the main character getting harmed or killed in its trailers?  . . does this mean arisu will die ?
Where is my beloved chisiya😢
Is that the train game?
Where is chishiya?
Where's chisiya??????
Where is chisiya..?

Bro, when will you bring Bloodhound season 2?
@netflix where is chishiya?
WHERE IS CHISHIYA???? 😢
This looks so good. Seems like Banda is the Joker? If so what is the other guy?
why i am getting squid game ending vibes ?? i swear i'll delete netflix if that's true
Where is Chisiya ?
So Ann will be there for like a cameo?
omg why can't shows just end nowadays? s2 ending was perfect but sure let's make another season of something that is already completed and remove the entire reason for the ending just to milk more money from ppl bc we can't come up with something new or original
What was that at the end?😟
Is this the final season?😳
Is that guy banda is joker
Where is the show stealer Chishiya😭
Where is our Chisiya
where is niragi character and more others character?
how am i supposed to watch without chishiya !?😭❤‍🩹
Where is cheshiya ?😢
where is our cast? why only arisu and usagi??
2.03 what the-  WHY DID ARISU GET SHOT??
Where is chidiya ??
Where is chisiya ??
Wait there are not horses in it , right ?
Once again, Netflix doesn't know where to stop and have to ruin every interesting show once it gain a bit of success... Is it that hard to end a show on a good note so that everyone keep some good memories about it? The meteorite explaination was perfect, not everything need to be milked
1:02 who is this cutie?  And why yamapi alive again and with clothes?
2:03 Yo, WTF bro?? Firstly it was Squid Game and now Alice in Borderland . Then, Stranger Things 😭
Wait. so how does Borderland work? I thought it was all just in their heads during the catastrophic event or something, somehow connected - but in comas.
Where is chesia 😢
I wonder why kuina, chishiya, aguni, etc didn’t come back for this season 😭😭
Am I the only ones that wants Aguni back?
WHY IS THERE A BABY THERE!!?! 😰😰1:38
WHERE IS AGUNI, KUINA, CHISHIYA, NIRAGI
so it's not an adaptation of Alice in Borderland RETRY? wow, i'm fooled.
Is this releasing in Hindi or not?
Can anyone suggest me some good web series? I have membership of netflix, prime and disney+ I watched almost all famous shows so recommend me something different. Genre preference: thriller, drama, crime, suspense, mystery, history, war, true story, action (but not too much action) I don't like horror, sci-fi and super hero shows like the boys, stranger things, GOT so don't recommend me like these. Thanks in advance 🙏
2:03 wtf? i thought they were gonna follow retry but ig not?
Where are Kuina and Chishiya?
Where is chishiya?
0:45 hasn’t Shibuki played this?
So we get to see Arisu curl up like a gayboy again??
Is that Chishiya 1:46 ...????? 🎉
I'm curious.. who's joker?
Who is talking to Arisu at the beggining of the trailer? Is he Chota?
Arisu and Usagi are married??!!!
Where is chishiya ?
What I don’t understand is that they gave us 2 seasons of characters we grew to love just too remove them from the season
will it be released in parts or the whole season at once
2:03 was it just spoiled that arisu gets shot by a laser and dies? He was by an exit here, where he got hit by the laser and earlier in that video it was shown that he was standing infront of a door where the outside world was, so what I think he gets shot by a laser right before exiting for the second time (he goes back for someone, maybe usagi or someone else but get shot in the head by one)
WHERE IS NIRAGI BRO
will niragi not play in this season?
I'm guessing we'll get answers, but this isn't making any sense to me. How  does anyone remember Borderlands after the end of season 2 and how do you go back? Maybe I just missed something from the first two seasons. And yes, I know there was one last card at the end of season 2.
where is Aguni?
where's my fav duo ??
WHERE IS CHISHIYA?!?!?
I wonder if they are including scenes from the manga that they didn’t adapt in the live action.
Why risk ruin a perfectly fine ending?
Where are the squeed game fans are now
So was the season 2 ending just a fake out?
Is it good guys?
Why tf they're showing the death of main character in trailer🥀
arisu deep inside a dream to come back Borderland?, and maybe die in dream is die in real world, i guess ? Hmm maybe something similar to the majestic Inception  !!!!
it was so hard watching the first 2 seasons, I thought it was over, then they do this?
so they just show how he dies at the end??? wtf
where is chishiya Netflix??????
2:08 its dream again?
man where is chisiya?
What about Season 3 of Castlevania: Nocturne?
WHERE IS CHISHIYA?
Where is chisiya?
2:03 what is this ???
AND WHO IS THAT BLUE HAIRED ICON????
They got married??? I saw the rings
where is chishiya???
WHERE'S CHISHIYA?
What is this
