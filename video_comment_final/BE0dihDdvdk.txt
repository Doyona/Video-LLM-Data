matts friends wit yanni, so why isn't he doing it???? not much friendship going on I guess.
Are you linked to MatArmstrong
Matt, silver with gold wheels? Do you buy jewellery off qvc?
How come yannie didn't do your wrap
How many cars did you buy and sell to get that baby!!
Flipped it already??
Rumours you've now sold this car?
The most important question is: Will the little blue plastic peel on the break pedal ever be removed?
Is that number plate legal?
@matwatsoncars can you do an update on your gt3rs please?
Mat shit? What kind of number plate is that 😂
Why do you always crazy over the top laugh at all jokes?
Great stuff.  How come you didn't have Yanni do this for you?  😀😁
Not at Yanimaize? Long time no videos with you. Everything is fine?
The old decals looked better, anyone else think the same?
Are the stickers not clear coated over?
Sheeehs, am I the only one who gets commercials every 2 minutes??
I wonder why Matt didn't choose Yiannimize as his detailing service provider.
How come you never went to Yanni??
Are you not going to Topaz detailers anymore?
Doesn't Yanni provide this service? 🤔
nice license plate, how many you paying in GB?
Come on Mat, why you don't go to Yianni al Yiannimize?!  😂 btw the spec is 🔥 marvelous ✨️ 🤩
Why  do you want our money/investment when you already have too much yourself???
Bought so many cars but ask for funding? Reminds me of crypto king sam bankman fried😂
Maaat, you've gone and leaked the reg in the b-roll just before the reveal man! How've you done that???
Is Greg using a camcorder? Interesting.
How do they create all of the templates? Would be interesting to know…
Does anyone know how much something like this costs?
Why get a beautiful spec and then get it covered with a new one?
I wonder how much commission is made for all these recommendations
Looks fantastic. Any idea the cost to To PPF the Centre Console? I have a mobility car so don't need a Bill at the end of the lease to replace the Mat Black Trim??
Looks amazing Matt. Why do you call the front fender a wing? Is that a British thing?
1 question. Yanni's company does not do this sort of thing? Why do you choose them over Yanni?
I wonder how much time Mat spends just staring at his car. I would sleep next to it.
love it love love it Matt! Made it yours with the extra decals and ppf, where did your guy get the number plate stickers?
Have you finally removed that final bit of blue tape on the pedals? It’s giving me nightmares, you left it on in your handover video and it’s still there now
How long until he realises the number plate reads "Mat Git"
I heard you have to tell your insurance if you wrap a car, is that true?
Where  is  youtube  😅
Is your best mate yani pissed off you didn't go to him for the wrap
what is wrong with mat´s eyes? Does someone know? Just wondering..
I am waiting for delivery of my own RS. Where did you get your front number plate and what size is it?
What you do when you buy your first expense car.... Hahaha I remember when I got my first expensive car.
Why, when removing ppf from new paint, will the paint peel off but not factory paint?
Matt, are you cheating on Yanni? You do know your boy does wraps for a living 🤔😏 does Yanni know about this?
why is matt orange 🤣 probbably some Brittish carrots
Mat, how old are you?
Whats the price for ALL that work? Probably another cars price :D
When can we get this in Gran Turismo 7 as a style we can use on the '22 GT3RS?
Does Matt have issues with his vision? They way holds his head and the slight eye deviation?
11 minutes for the hardest panel… and they charge how much? 💀
Why cover the plate to show it anyway??????
My question is why isn’t he doing it at yiannimize?
I wonder what it says if you take the 91 out of matts private plate.....
How come Yianni didn’t get the ppf work?
Why would you choose a right hand drive? I know you're live i the UK, but the price will be significantly lower than a left hand drive in a few years, won't it?
Is this the same Mat Watson who posted a video yesterday asking us to raise millions for CarWow.
Aaron Ramsdale wraps cars?
Does anyone know what Mat's smartwatch is?
So did you go with gloss or satin?
WHY DIDN'T YOU SHOW IT OUTSIDE?????!!!!
How is Yianni one of your best friends and you have someone else ppf/wrap your car? That’s gotta hurt.
Did he do Saturn or gloss?
Why on earth would you have black and white front plate and yellow and black rear. Sorry is this a UK thing? I would have thought you have yellow or gold and black emblems. Actually grey plates with light gold numbers to  match your decals would be perfect if thats allowed. Beautiful work though those guys sure did a great job!. Just btw I got a ride in a slightly modified blue GT3 (about 475kw) and holy smokes we pulled 1.8g in just 1 street block. These things are Nuts. Good on ya  Matt - wish you many miles of fun driving with that!
Why didn't Yani wrap the car?
Why did I even noticed the number plate before the reveal at 23:39
Erm is that plate legal?
Why not Yanni? Wont he be able to assist you?
omGG! Are you putting piano black vinyl over carbon fibre?..?
Why is nobody talking about that small piece of tape on the brake pedal....
Lower the car??
Can I just ask why on earth would you pay £78k in interest through Charles & Dean on the loan they’ve given you to by the Porka 🤔 What an absolute waste of money paying all that interest!!
Protection for what? Your investment? 😂
Why didn’t he go to yianni for this work?
Why didn’t wrap at yiannimize?
What was the price for all this wrapping and coating?
Is harry really big or is Matt really small…?
Anyone know why he didn't go to Yanniemize for this?
Sorry for being Captain Sensible but is that number plate legal?
What side are you on as EBYR50 divides the wealthy from the poor?
Why is EBYR50 doing so well? That is concerning to me.
Super cool video ! Do you think amazons EBYR50 will pump before ETH ? I ask myself if there is a pattern in the order of the altcoins pumps.
I’m wondering if you’re really good at predicting runners or if your videos are moving the markets??? Either EBYR50 is working thanks…
This week is hell and a bloodbath can happen but why we don't discuss the fact that Ebay also released their EBYR50 in it? Always two sides of a coin
@mattwatson Why didn’t you get Yianni to do your PPF? He would have done mates rates for cash!! 😂😂
what about the rear view mirror? haha
WHY? have i not yet cancelled my subscription? 'cos i was waiting for this utterly stpd thumbnail to appear. this is becoming a joke. good riddance!
Why Yani didn’t do this?
why didn't he taken it to Yianny?
Why ruin it?
What other car? Is it a Porsche and were you forced to buy it to get the gt3 rs? Now that would be a good video
What does your friend yianni think of this 🤔?
Just how annoying was Mat Watson, while this poor bloke was trying to do his job? 😂
Hi Mat, lovely spec on your GT3! Just curious, are't you missing air intake cover/case on the left rear fender?
Lovely car, but is it really a 911? Seems more like a PlayStation blended with a space ship.
Are you worried you have got in late with the used prices plummeting in the last few months
Won't that front plate be illegal, as a little undersized.
Are you even going to drive it after all the protection? Imagine if you curbed a wheel or got a stone chip on the bonnet...
where is your tesla plaid?
Lol ohhh the joy of Mat 😂  But… at some point, You are actually going to actually drive the car???😂😂😂
Cost? Or sponsored?
Is Harry a giant?😂
So we know the cost of the car plus options. How much for the paintwork protection? (However much it is I’m pretty sure it’s worth it in the long term)
30k for a license plate? Is it really that expensive?
Isn't the plate illegal though, so why have it done like that?
WTF are those plates prices, are you fucking kidding me? Here it's flat 200 quid (converted from local currency) for custom plates regardless of what you put on them (ofc offensive stuff is banned)
Why not Topaz detailing 🧐
Matt did you buy this to flip it quickly on the used market? If so, values won’t hold up for long.
@18:34 Mat's Australian cousin?😄
