Was this shot on film originally? Quality is excellent!
November 2025 here?
Who’s still listening in November 2025?? ❤️🎶
October 2025 anyone?
Youtube didn't let you replace the original video? Or you prefer to keep the original unchanged?
Wonderful work, congrats to all involved and hoping there are more tapes available in the vaults. Can we get now at least 720p of the original video? The version uploaded 16 years ago is just 360p...
Can you do the same with the others videos please??? Listen to your heart, its must been love...
How many people loves and support Roxette?🎸❤
Who is the drummer?
at the 3:19 mark what happened to the boy becoming a old man like in the original?
Did they used AI?🤯 seems she still alive 🥲
I recognize Gamla Stan and City Hall. Where is the golden room?  This video really made me miss Marie this morning. Tack Roxette!!
Beautiful images thats true, but what's with the edits? For example when Marie starts to sing, she's not in scene, some lip synchronization are wrong, the climax, the rose smashing in the ground is off synch too. Not all the newer stuff are better 😢
