Hahahaha al jazeera why are you deleting comments that are criticizing your journalist & this interview. And why are you deleting comments which are clearly showcasing the real truth behind this agenda? . You guys are deleting comments that are not supporting to you. This has happened to many commentators now. Clear bias journalism with hidden agendas.
What bullshit question is this journalist?
What's wrong going to birthday party? They must be relatives. Keep personal connections and politics serpetate please
What about the all the atrocities the LTTE committed?? War is not unilateral, both sides are guilty of humanitarian crimes.  He is the only guy that tried to broker a 2 state solution.
Why does Mehdi Hasan's face look like "always constipated"?
Why didn’t Ranil ask help from MANAWAMMA

Why do both of them talking at the same time. Its hard to listen
Who will come to get interviewed by this mad man who doesnt allow the guest to talk..he can question and answer himself..no wonder this poor journalist got fired from msnbc😂😂😂
Im not a RW fan, but why are Mehdi et all bombarding  just this person with all these questions?
My humble request. Can jazeera interview former president Mahinda Rajapaksa?  It's really fantastic debate. Congrats Mr Mahdhi
Why did he even went there? 😂
I don't know if the people there know about the LTTE terrorists using suicide bombers to kill Sinhalese people en masse. I think all the people there are supporters of the LTTE terrorists. They have a huge grudge against the Sinhalese people. Do they know or not that 72% of Sri Lanka is made up of Sinhalese people?
Hey Hasan/ Al Jazeera ,could you please confirm how long this interview lasted? Mr. Wickramasinghe mentioned in the media that it was a 2-hour program but was only aired for 48 minutes. Please confirm this.
Some of these questions should go to Mahinda and co. Mehdi Hasan, why don't you invite MR / GR and co and do this interview? Get the same audience and get the same panelists and try it out. Can you? I bet you CANNOT!
Why are you only talking about the victims of North and East? How about the victims of the other part of the country? Do you think those people who were killed from the other part of the country are useless? Justice is justice whether they are from North or South.
when was the last time islamic sympathizers Mehdi and his puppet masters Qatar invite any third world muslim country's leader and questioned like this ?
Could u give timestamps just want to see whether he justifies the genocide against the tamils
Why you upload the edited video .. Maybe a court order push you to drop the original video it will be just like Kamala Harris unedited CBS video
What a stupid way to answer questions.
How you get such people on your platform at the first place! I really wonder is it money or some kind of bond... Taking the least accountable people and holding them accountable!  Wow...And Mehdi Hasan is so dauntless... I would really like an episode on how AlJazeera manages such impossible interviews
Why they haven’t invited Sinhala people to make it fair.
asking for a friend  . Is this channel supporting LTTE ?
Where did I come from and how am I stuck? My throat is getting dry. I will never come to this political side again. Just leave me alone, God 😭😭
You call this is journalism? He can question the Gulf  states..he’ll never ..other powerful nations politicians 😂😂😂 you guys having ajenda surrounded by former LTTE supporters 😂😂😂even he talk about what’s happening Nabor countries..
Does good journalism mean asking questions and interrupting the speaker when he is explaining? How ridiculous is that? It's clearly very poor journalism. It's good to satisfy certain groups of people who like to hear what they want but not the truth.
Why you did not ask these questions from Rajapaksha's family last 10 years...  Your question very sensible and smart.
I admit that Mr. Ranil & Rajapakse’s behaviors towards common people was not good. I don’t like those regimes. But, a very few nations were there to help us during the war period. I ask one question. Why now?  We don’t need international investigation for such crimes that happened. A new government should execute an internal investigation with an acceptable transparency.
Al Jazeera, why didn't you upload the full interview? The original interview was nearly two hours long, while this was only 50 minutes. Is that because the former Sri Lankan president blasted your Mehdi Raza Hasan? Please upload the FULL INTERVIEW!
How about the stilankan catholic Church taking the ltte flag to pope frances and getting it blessed? What do u think of that? We all know about u all. Wickremesinghe is now a spent force for tge west now. That's the only difference 😂
Can you please invite Gota or Basil to this next time?
Ridiculous questions all biased and completely without basis or facts to substantiate them. Who gives the authority for these questions to be asked as though they are all true??
Can you make an interview with Daisy Achi?
Justice for civil war victims! Why is it always the people in the North in Sri Lanka who are regarded as war victims? People in the South lost lives due to suicide bombers, and they deserve justice, too.
Do any of you remember Callum Macrae?
Who does appoint AG of Sri Lanka?
Those asking if journalists in Sri Lanka question politicians like this. Did you guys grow up in Sri Lanka in the 80s, 90s and 2000s? Do you remember how journalists, even the common people for that matter were taken out for speaking the truth or confronting politicians or confronting the narrative the politicians were trying  to paint? Do you remember white vans? I can still viscerally feel the unsafety of growing up in Sri Lanka.
Has the author ever tried to research the innocent others who lost lives at the hand of terrorists over 26 years.
Is this funded my diaspora??
O Worried about the victims, but what have they done to the victims? The other thing is that all these things happen only for money
How a such Butcher become such clam?
Why the lady have questions written, can see already she is on preparation of condom the country of srilanka
Is this a comedy show ?
All the Sinhala Buddhists who come here and claim to be healed, How many of you actually carry the guilt of Tamil Genocide? Or are you just here to watch your ex-president get roasted and eat popcorn?
What he does is if any question has a direct impact on him turn it into a joke otherwise you can see the Lion If you want a real grill bring any of the Rajapaksha s , but make sure get them wear a diaper first.
Can I? Can I? Can I? Can I? 😝😝😝😝 RW and his political future (if he had at least a slim chance) it was f….ek on international media.
Wow next time ask why he has English name as well during British era in SL..? Time to time many people use in western world use that names for benefit 😘
Why did you change the DP referring to war crimes?
Ranil : U gonna do what abt it ?  😂😂 ( sri lankan politics = joke ) its a fkin game
Did anyone question other countries like this? Why Sri Lanka.
what about the killings over 30 years, even if you can justify the cause they were fighting for? This type of solutions are generations old.
How gave him a job in al jaseera asking foolish questions without proof no background working just asking like some uneducated opposition and not even listening to the answer
If there was a legal election and had a majority, is it a crime in Sri Lanka? when it is the accepted democratic process for the whole world.
How come you guys not talking about what Tamil tigers did to our country?  LTTE did the War crimes not our sri lankan army.  You guys are famous for hiding the truth. Talk with people who care about sri lanka not from the people who destroyed the country.
Is everything a game to you ???  Yes he was a gamer and he played with sri lanka .. rw mf
When you ask about war crime they have no guts to face the question in front of the world, shame on them..
Can you interview putin and zelensky regarding Ukraine war?
interviewing by not allocating time to answer is journalism?  This is totally the vision of the journalist . He tries to prove his aspects. At least they must telecast/ upload the unedited version of the discussion . This is partial to killers who killed thousands of sri lankans  by Tamil tigers.
Mr bean - Where is the report ??😂😂
This man was the prime minister and governed the country for 6 times. If he is a good leader, how come SL face this crisis after 6 episodes of his governance? 😂 He was the part of the problem.... The current government is far better than each and every government in the past.
Where is the report where is the report where is the report?
Where is the evidence  There is no report  I deny the allegations  Sri Lankan politicians are above the law  Justice will be served to the poor with interest some times  With the new government hoping things might change a little bit  But doubt the big fishes will ever be caught, like this joker
Why are you interrupting
It just 49.27mnts? Where is the un-edited full program? This is going to another direction,as a Sri Lankan, We can understand what is going here..
What was your reaction?
Why is the interviewer interrupting him
What is this reporter doing here? What is his role in this meeting? His part is unclear.🤔
Who's next ?
"Was the journalist who questioned Ranil Wickremesinghe on Al Jazeera a terrorist or an extremist?"
😢too painful to watch. What was RW trying to achieve?
Why can’t the Tamils just move to India , find issues there and leave Sri Lanka to the Sinhalese?
I wonder how these politicians can sleep peacefully after doing all these atrocities and killings to their own country.
Why is there no Sinhalese representation on the board? They have a story too. I think more than 100 million Tamils live in India and around the globe. If they really want a territory, they can establish it in Tamil Nadu.
Dear Hiru and Derana Tv, (srilankan unuseful medias)  learn from aljazeera, how to take interviews from corrupt politicians?  Respect Mehdi🫡 and Aljazeera🤝
Can you please post the entire interview without cutting and editing ?
why is there a LTTE panel? they are biased
When Sri Lankan are doing well now, why these aliens want to talk about this poor country when the countries they live in do more atrocities world wide behind closed doors
why  dont you question Keir Starmer like this?
Does anyone know the root cause of this conflict?
What a despicable man is this? He is asking where is the report. The report clearly stated that Ranil Wickramasinghe must be PROSECUTED.
Isn't this a Hamas channel  ?
What was your motive in this exercise? If you want your audience to get the other person's response better, give him time and space rather than being arrogant. Your motive of making the other uncomfortable and uneasy was well observed.
Our hard earned money deposited with the Banks for getting interest for our survival was taxed. Why?
You should at least let him answer the question. Always talking over and moving on to the next question. What's the point of interviewing then?
How about the corruption during his rule
Can you guys keep him? Please don't let him get back on the return plane
Is Ranil crying 😂😂😂😂???  Well done reporter . Respect you.
why intrviewer not giving time to answer him..
CIvil War??  it's Separatist war between a terrorist ethnic group and Army.!
Can you please interrogate the somali president this would interesting
Separatist group? You mean the terrorists.
Is this a comedy show😂😂😂😂entha moana Ranil center fresh sapadanga😂😂😂😂
Why no answer the question raised regarding why LTTE didn't agree for the peace when RW invited them to come for the peace agreement when he was the PM in 2002 to 2004?
It is now quite apparent that international politics and media are pushing for another war in Sri Lanka. If their intentions were honest, why was the interview so polarized towards one extreme? Why wasn't a balanced view presented to the viewers? Isn't that part of the problem? You expect justice when your interview itself sets an bad example of not serving justice to a balanced view.
What a childish way to act upon the civil war question!!
Which type of foolish questions ?
What happened to this journalist ?
Just wanted to know has mehdi hassan only seeing Ranil at rajapaksa birthday party singing, not the time ranil lost to rajapaksa ? But Ranil could have been sarcastic instead of getting angry
Is this LTTE propaganda being used against Ranil Wickremesinghe? The majority of the questions are not even related to him, as he has always been with the minority UNP. This was part of the U.S. liberal political agenda against Rajapaksa and Shavendra, but now things will change with conservatives in power for Rajapaksa.
Has anyone lost a grandfather? 🤔🤔🤔 He's here. Please go and take care of him.🙏🙏🙏
Who is to blame for Sri Lanka’s crises? One is Infront of you

Insted of Answering the Q? He just try to bring Religion and cover. All fals answer
Why no one asked about new born babies killed by LTTE? Why no one asked about bomb blats did by LTTE targeting civilians in south? Why no one asked about killing Kadirgamar former minister foreign affairs ( who was Tamil)?
How can gotabaya be arrested without a single charge ? Moron
Do you think this guy was a president? None of the issues fell under his responsibility.
Can u please do investigation about what JVP party did things in 88 to 89
This?  F****** man is a bank robbery, man.
What about all the Sinhalese were killed including women and children???
Why the interviewer not giving enough time for guest to answer?
Can you add sinhala subtitles
What about the thousands of Sinhalese people that were killed by the LTTE during the war? It was mass murder. Why doesn’t Tamil Diaspora talk about it?
Who is to blame for Sri Lanka’s crises? COVID, JVP, LTTE
For the sake of my knowledge i would like to know this head to head with talk with former president Of srilanka mr ranil wickramasinghe where took place means (which country)?
Why roasting one person ? Now all lives peacefully as one nation .one country ❤️   Any hidden intentions ! Just curious.
What is the purpose of interview with this guy?
He did not have no money to only to hold election  But he has money for all other unnecessary events ?
We do not accept war and what happened in the past. I know it is painful to lose loved ones. However, these kind of arguments tend to ask this question. Why no one is bothered about the civilians who were killed by the LTTE for decades? Specially sinhalese?
Really Bad journalism by Al Jazeera, When do you guys going to release another half of the interview?
Regarding Batalanda,  Ranil: Where is the report?👀 Reporter: Here it is! 😏 Ranil: Where?🥲😭
Leader and politician who to answer the question?
Where's ur ferari license ??
How could he have gone for a system change by not putting the show back of the road and prosecute the criminals when he himself is criminal
What is with the constant jumpcuts when the ex SL president was speaking?
Reporters must ask the the question cleaely and give the time to answer ... why the reporter is jumping like  frog or a dog and disturbing without complete his answer ??
Did anyone talk about how LTTE did war crimes on those days ? How 6 hunderd police officer were killed
Ranil flew all the way to the UK to get cooked? 😂
So if your telling rw protected rajapaksha's Who's protecting them now? Rw❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Jeez.... how can he avoid the main question about not bringing Rajapakshas for what they had done?????
Did the president violate the Constitution? No.
What cunning joker this Ranil Wickramasingha?
