Does the Costco card really have the member's photo on it?  Not that way at Sam's.  Just wondering how accurate this narrator is, if she's even human.  I suspect it's AI.

Has Costco added a Scan&go feature to its app that is the same or better than Sam’s Club?  The absence of that fantastic feature is a dealbreaker for my needs.  I prefer not to drag a load of warehouse goods to a random cashier or slow, overcrowded self-checkout kiosk.
How about putting a bathroom not only in the front of the store for people but in the back also.

What about Scan and Go so you can scan the products with your phone and pay on your phone and not have to wait in line.  This is literally the only reason I shop at Sam’s because I don’t have time to wait in the long lines at Costco.
Raising the membership fees to remain profitable??? Seems like Costco is doing just fine with all the openings in the US and overseas.........seems like the CEO wants a bigger paycheck!!
