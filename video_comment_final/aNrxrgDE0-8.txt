I wonder if this is gonna be another People Feeling Miserable The Series.
"You can communicate with them!"  First message: "y tho?" Second message: "bcuz."
Where is Caspar??
Episode 6 timeline? 2 years ago mothership was brought down so why are they shocked about aliens in ep6?
1:27 What’s the music called in the trailer? If anyone knows, that would be brilliant 👍🏼
where is Maya? 😢
I wonder if it's only me that when watching the shows intro gets taken back to the early days of the pandemic? The vibes it gives with the song and the imagery of empty streets, people alone with the fog everywhere. It gives me 3 months into lock down
2:00 Does anyone know the song that is played at the end of this trailer?
what episode shall i watch from if i want to skip the slow burn
Bro, why you still shooting at them? We already now that most personal weapons don't work on them. Just run for your life man.
Where are Casper, Luke and Sarah?
am i crazy or im getting half life vibes?
what tf? what happened to the last scene of season 2? What happened to the blond and indian boy? What's going on?
Is this worth picking up?
Is something finally going to happen after two seasons of nonsense
0:40 What in the AI generated voice??
is this worth watching
how can i watch apple tv in Turkey😭
I want to try to watch this but I heard season 1 is very slow. Is it worth it to push through?
And the kid?
Is “Casp” coming back 😂😂😂😂 🤦🏽‍♂️
I wonder how fast this season will put me to sleep. Perhaps the 2.5 minute trailer contains all the action scenes of the 600 minutes of S3.
How did Constellation get cancelled after 1 season, when this train wreck of a show keeps getting renewed?
Why dose no one talk about this show it’s just a show that’s on Apple I don’t see anyone reviewing it on yt.
So is this an reboot of the 2005 series or something entirely different ???
Where is Caspar?
Where is that boy??
Show any good? Never watched it.
Does anyone know the name of the song near the end “the world keeps spinning”?
Is this show worth it?
WHERE IS CASPAR!!!!!!!
I wonder did they use Apple suit of software 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Which country was this filmed in?
Anyone is this worth it? I on season one episode 5 and omg it’s boring and slow… I’m trying to hold on here does it get better?
Isn't this the show with Jasper in it? I didn't see him in the trailer
What is this show even about any more?
Do you ever wonder how these beings can build a ship, technology, etc? It's like us sending prehistoric creatures to another planet ...  0% intelligence 100% destruction!
Prepping the masses for watts next?
Been waiting 2 years to get a better shot of the mother ship(really want to know how big it is, there's next to no media for this show I swear)now they're doing a time jump and it's crashed??
Where tf is Casper??
Wait did i miss a session? Last Time i watched it they went through the portal and trevonte and caspar were in some kind of dimension. Now it’s been 2 years since it’s over? What happened?
who is watching this?
wasnt there a kid who could control them? he is nowhere in this trailer
Where are the boys? the genius British boy?  The doctor’s son?
Is this show worth watching
Wait so the Giant Mothership the size of the Moon that was causing a gravitational instability was actually destroyed or is it still just floating up there causing havoc?  Because that point is never a dress and I would think a several thousand km long ship floating in orbit would kind of be Target number one
is this show any good? is it on par with show like Reacher, Resident Alien, etc?
How is this show still on?
How does this get a 3rd season and there's still no news about Pachinko season 3?
"What is the last thing you remember?"  Uh, something about David Bowie? I think? I dunno, man. This show is hard to remember.
Quick question - why do so many shows/films about aliens have to use that exact sound effect at 1:58? I've heard it in so much stuff
Do i have to wait until Aug 22 or can you Invade me any sooner please?
