Why can she speak Spanish ??
i mean, why do that? she seemed like a nice lady. she wanted to help you but she also has her right to work in her language. its a country with TWO official languages. what an attention-seeking pussy
Why wouldn’t she just speak English? Montreal est une ville bilingue.
Why does this matter? There people homeless, drug problems and high crime in this province.

😂 so disrespectful if she doesn’t speak it or decides not to speak it you can’t force her who are you ?
What's this dudes problem? She was willing to introduce you to someone to help you! She makes minimum wage and probably got screwed over by the system, and your making her day even more terrible.
Are you kidding me??? So she has to speak English to serve English speaker!! So if you go to China you need them to speak your English to serve you??? …
