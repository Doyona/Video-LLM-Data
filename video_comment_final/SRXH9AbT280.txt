Tell me if I'm being just naive or am I worthy of something, now?
The female artist sounds exactly like someone else! Can someone help me who it is? Exilia?

And now the real question that no one seems to be asking:  How good is this new era of Linkin Park at making songs for Dragon Ball Z AMVs?
Why Chester leave us so soon 🥲❔
Is this the greatest music video ever made?
Cause she is not Chester maybe?   xD
What happened to chester??
Is it just me, or does this have the reference of every video editing style from the past, from Burn it down to new divide ❤❤. Every word of this song sounds like a cheer for Linkin Park to rise again!🤜🤛
Who is here  in august 2025? 👇
Oh my God, is this song going to be a year old? Time flies.
Anyone on August 2025?
What part of background singer does this guy not understand?
Is it a new Linkin Park? No, not really. This is a new beginning for the band, Emily has a great voice in this song and others but this isn't Linkin Park anymore.
chester who ?!  jk...rip. kudos 2 LP for reinventing themselves
Where's the new stuff, without the peanut gallery?
Why does the bar they were in look like the one from the show, New Girl?
How many more songs on the album is she singing in? Love her! 😭❤️
A question to videomaker by ignorant, ho do you make the part at 1:43 to 1:46?
This is horrible why ruin LP?
Am I the only one who notices a clear throwback to Breaking The Habit in the video here? Masterpiece.
Was I the only one who cried when they played again? That mix of joy, nostalgia, and emotion just hit so hard.
Will they defeat the system once again?
love it, but feels short.. just 2 verses and the repeating chorus/pre-chorus? kinda expecting meaty songs from linkin park, not repeating the same 20 words 10 times
Can someone send this song back to the 90s, so my younger self can rock out to it too 😂
How can she both sing those lyrics and be a scientologist?
Who’s the female name for replacement of Chester?
Who at June 2025?
No hate, Emily sounds great ofcourse not legendary but doesn't this track sound like Final Masquerade?
Don't you know this, Song is overplayed?!
Wait does she morph into the likeness of Chester at the end??
is it me or does this song scream Percy De Rollo?
June 2025 anyone ?
How am i just learning of this song 👌🏾🔥🔥

Why the bra was left there bro . Something?
Is anyone else attending NYC Linkin Park concert in July 2025  ??? ♾
I listened to this without watching the video and I thought “was this an unfinished song? Featuring Emily?” Cause at the beginning Mike sounded like Chester. But tbh, I actually like the song. Definitely gives Linkin Park. Emily’s voice is amazing. Cant wait to see what LP has in store for the bands future ❤
Is that the bar from New Girl??
Nothing from Linkin Park?
who else is listening this for weeks on end since the release?

Why does this sound like a RWBY song?
Makes me think What if scenario 🤔 or what to do now! ?? Not a good situation to be in😢
Chester possessed Emily? Hi everyone
Am I the only one who's just gót an ad for their new song before this one?? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Lol, why is everyone so obsessed with the notion that they shouldn't try to replace Chester? There would be nothing wrong with trying to find someone who can keep the old sound alive. Fair enough that they wanted to make a change, but there would have been nothing wrong with sticking to something closer to Chester's sound.
Did anyone notice the Chester necklace at 1:14?? I just learned about this today😭  *Left side of the tv*
No more found demo tracks?

Who is here 2025 ?
First time I see the clip. And 2nd I heard the music. I was sleeping 6 months or what ? 😭😂😂 ❤❤
No one will ever be able to replace Chester. Should Linkin Park therefore quit or get a fresh restart? At least the sound remains the same and she doesn't sing that badly. Give Linkin Park 2.0 a chance
Why you just don't change the name of Linkin park? I am die hard fan. Because of Chester... He made you guys millions and made so much more amazing emotions and live performances where people go to look at him. Sorry. But he was the Linkin Park.
Who is here in 2025? ❤
Is this the list of the Song you Hates...?  Where's the "Worst" part...? I don't hear it to be honest

Is this what a narcissist feel like  inside hiding behind a illusion  because of the scar deep inside
Who agrees that this has to be the song for the next Transformers? To be continue....
Anyone right now?
is it just me or are these lyrics pieces of old linkin park songs? "Cut me open, just to watch me bleed", "I only wanted to be part of something."
Is that the bar from new girl?
and what next? a year has passed
Am I trippin or is Chester's silhouette showing in the last scene where she stands???

Hey Chester, do you see this ?
Do you remember your first time here?
@0:46 Is that meant to be Emily?
0:14 is that a quest 3? those joysticks look different
Like most other linkin park songs; is there a meaning to this song?
Any else get triggered by Emily singing the back catalogue? 🤔
Any body getting HT and THP vibes?
2:56 what effect do u want?    PIXEL
Is this about scientology? Also, I love the fried hair, so relatable.
Am I the only one who thinks that the best parts of the song are precisely the ones in which the new vocalist doesn't participate?
who is here from the zero?
two questions: "who the F approved this video as official one?" and "who the F approved this song to be released and once again ruin legacy of LP?", sad but true :/

Damn what a great song, I already was a fan of Linkin Park! - Why does the bar looks like the bar from 'New Girl' ?
Is this song about MK Ultra and  Monarch programming? Sounds like...
Anyone July in 2025 ?? ❤🎉💥
who  likes  to listen to rock music?
Is she the singer for Here Comes Vi from league of legends?
Yo is that the bar from New Girl?
cant replace chester right, but goddamn is she not linkin park?
2:02 how does this girl get a free ride on LINKIN PARKs success?
Do you know that feeling when you hear a new song and you like it so much that you listen to it over and over again for the next few days? And when your favourite moment in the song drops in, you feel that shiver down your spine? Well, I thought Linkin Park wouldn't give me that feeling anymore with new songs how wrong I was.... fortunately thank you for still being there Linkin Park
0:58 - Does anyone else hear the Buffy The Vampire Slayer opening theme song?

Who's watching in 2025?

Is song needs to be raw Netflix
How many times have you listened to this song? Me: yes.
Can you do a deconstruct of this amazing track? I really want to know the mixing part
Lots of people said they cried with the chorus, to me it was the part that starts at 2:13. Is it just me that HEARS chester? Like, legit as if it was him singing with them? Idk, maybe it's just me, but damn, that got me good.
Jesus, Mary & Joseph, can you feel the emotions of this song?!  I'm in.
is that the bar from new girl?
How can i give them treats? i saw it somewhere but i cannot find it in the shop..Like i cannot find them there
Is Linkin Park back? Why use female vocals?
have you guys notice that all of them are middle class and lower class?
When will they arrive in El Salvador?
The song is great, but what going on with the MV? 😂 Definitely intended to early 2000's vibe but somehow doesn't seem to be matched eventually.
Am I the only one bothered by her being a scientologist? Or her support of Danny Masterson?
Is it just me or Emily gave Chester vibe at 2:10?
Will the band have different singers every couple of albums from now on? The singer here is still with her own band
Did Chester write this song fr ?
Am i the only one imagining this song with Chester's Voice and start crying ?
What this is real?
do kids still like this today or is it only the 40+ crowd that keeps playing this ?
Is that the bar from New Girl?
Someone of years 2000?
Am I the only one thinking, why the hell they'd not add the choir from the intro (From Zero) into this one?! Such a materpiece.
Anyone else? Thought the screen was glitching
What? Mike even sounds like Chester.  He really can sing this good. 😮
Awesome song! ....but no closed caption? :-(
2:13 Give me chills! Was I the only who heard Chester's voice? Damn!
The question I have is would Chester be cool with her when she supported the guy from the 70s show when he was a sex offender?
Anyone else think Mike Shinoda sounds a lot like Finn from Glee on this song?
what hat is emily wearing?
Are you laughing at Chester?!?
where have you been for 20 years??
Is it about buddhistic emptiness term, and how emptiness becomes a machine, why emptiness is a machine
Who is she
Amazing music,but who is this girl??? 😂😂😂
Could Emily explain to us her links with the Church of Scientology and especially her assassin friend?
Could Mike explain to us why you went out during the month to combat suicide?
What this is LP?
Didn't know XQC had a sister? Especially one that can actually sing? 🙃🤣
When does Linkin Park doing another album for the band
Is the dude at 1:11 supposed to look like Isaac Kappy ?
If I am not mistaken...I see Kurt Cobain in this video??? Emily showing her Cobain influence?...
Anyone else remember when they jumped into this song in Arlington, TX in 2024?
Why can't I find drummer Bourdon?
Where did they find this fabolous girl??? So cute, sweet and..... wonderful
Everyone talking about replacing chester, what about the OG drummer?
Can someone explain me why i cry everytime i listen this Song? Emily Is super , welcome back Linkin Park
Diddy…it? Is this a song about Chester’s death?
Maybe is just a sound effect or am I the only one hearing Chester screaming at 0:45?
Is this the bar from New Girl?
Is that the New Girl (Nick's) bar??? ❤❤❤
@NotchVFX is this you?
Why does she always dress like a hobo? At least now, she's going places unlike her last band.
Should I tell you what they think they are attempting to accomplish? There’s no point these ridiculous wanna be on the charts so badly for validation ppl just come up with a different game plan
Why am I crying? 🥺🥺
2:14 I swear I hear Chester in the vocals. Am I wrong?
Why am I emotional? Welcome back my Linkin Park.!
2:12 am I the only one that hears a part of Chester in this part?
Isn't that the bar from the tv show new girl?
November 2024, anyone?
who else cried? like... tears just came out...
So Mike is it true you blocked Chester’s son on social media after he was critical of your weird friend?
Is it me or is it really Chester voice ? I really feel that he’s with the band especially in 2:20
who tf is she??? lame af
you got some one with totally different views to front lp?
Am I the only one who gets "Get Jinxed" from League of Legends vibes?

Why about this guy from hybrid theory?
What if Paramore and LP had a child 🤩
Who else here from 2010?
Am I the only one who likes this song?
Who is here in 2050? 🎉
New Linkin Park?
00:45 Is this the scream of the one I think? 😮😮😮  Reminds me of him or i just miss him so much
Who’s listening to the whole album right now 🙌??? ❤
Who’s still listening in 2067?
Who's here after the album? 🔥💯
Mmm the riff is the same that faint? 😁
Is it weird that I just started liking Linkin Park now
Who's here?
Love it! Am I the only one who hears a little bit of Chester when they sing together? Maybe it's my imagination.
Who's watching in 2019?
is this the bar from NEW GIRL !?
Who's here in 2100?
So am I the only one who recognized the bar from New Girl? 🤣
Song awesome. video what was this???
So I have to listen to an ad every time I want to listen to this vide?
Why’s there a 15 second ad before every video YouTube?
01:38 is this look a homage to Kurt Cobain? Btw, I'm glad LP found a new singer. Chester was great and I will miss him and his music. Emily is great and I'm happy to get to hear more from her. Stop hating and start loving my friends.
Its just me, or she sounds similarly like Sandra Nasić from Guano Apes? :D
Who came here from Vani?
Does anyone else think that Emily joining is like Paramore and LP collaborating together? ☺️👌🏽
Who’s here in 2048?
Can someone make it chester ai version for this song?
ANYONE CAME FROM VANIS SHORT? ❤❤😂
Who are willing to back after 5 years?

Is it just me, or this music sounds a lot like those league of legends world musics? Sounds so epic tho
godessss girl!!!!! wtf is that voice!!!!!?!!? <3
the bar scene, at a glance, appears to be the set from new girl?
Random question 😂...... Does the 😍🥵🥰 exceptional Em bat for the girls team ? I ask coz I'm a 42yr old woman who is so not straight I have come to realise 🎉❤🎉
Is it just me? Or does Emily sound like Timmy Turner from that show Fairy OddParents.
Karaoke cover band ?
How can Chesters mam not like this tune 😪
I’ve been a metalhead since the 80’s and all I want to know is why am I just discovering Devin Townsend?!?!
Anybody noticed that Mike is painting Emily.. and when the image comes to life you can hear her scream?
Who is the singer  for the emptiness machine
Did they just remove all comments about scientology? 🤔
for those who didn't like a new singer , would you prefer pop linkin park like it was after minutes do midnight ? Her agressive vocals are even better then Linking park post minutes to midnight
I wonder how many have given up who they ARE for what their so called friends wanted them to be,
How many times you watch this? Me: Yes.
Am I going crazy?  Why do I always tear up listening to this song!!!! How much I have missed Linkin Park since Chester went away and how much I hid my sadness is now all coming out, tears of joy for the REBIRTH.  Take care of yourself Emily.  Take care of yourselves Linkin Park, each one of you.
How is this song soooooo much better then heavy is the crown? I love this song so much but i hate heavy is the crown :0
Anyone here from the early 2000s?
Is this bennigtons sister😂(just fun) she sounds like him
Did anybody else notice the bar in the video is the bar from the show New Girl? Is that a subtle reference or completely coincidental?
Really?,mother t whatever who you think Suzy FARLEY some know if you don't too bad done rio chester grails rule ❤😂🎉😢😮😅
I wonder how much hate she must endure, until she sings with so much pain like Chester. It seems like humans are not able to learn, or haven’t been to such dark places before. You must have “balls of steel” to step in such footprints. I respect and support that! Keep pushing!
Anyone listening from Nepal?
Why is Linkin Park over 20 years later still the soundtrack to my life?  Awesome song can't wait for the album
Love LP but is that the bar from New Girl??
The bar from new girl ?😅
Who's here in 2027?
Is it possible that I hear Chester in 2:13-2:32 ?
is she with Scientology or not? i hear so many rumors
Did this sound like Linkin Park?  I love Emily being in the band. Rock on 🤘 🇺🇸
Is it  just me or is this song just nasty?
Dont you think this song and Heavy is the crown, sounds very very similar on the melody?
I love the song, and I don't know why but in this bit from 2:14 to 2:32 it sounds like is Chester singing. Idk if its my brain that bc is a Linkin Park song it forces that ideia on me or if they made it on purpose to sound a bit like him. Does anyone can ear it also? Or am I just yaping?
Weird idea, but what if this was music for Valorant?
Is that the bar from New Girl
Is that Xochitl Gomez?
Dear Emily, where were you all this time? What a f...in' great song!!!! Amazing!!!
How is this song not a chart topper?
Being a fan, I wasn't big on this singer because it's not Chester but what is the band going to do? Live in the memories of Chester's death or move forward? I'm sure Chester wouldn't want the band as a whole to suffer and stifle all of thier creativity and talent that they still have. Life has to move forward. Chester will always be the heart of this band but I'm assuming he would want them to move forward and succeed. That's what most human beings would want for the people they love. Remember me, but don't ever give up. RIP Chester, you will never be forgotten and I wish the band all of thier previous success to happen now. They deserve it. Live life, it's too short.
Is your new vocalist STILL a Scientologist???? I’d be looking into this boys. Fans are NOT happy
It feels like a different band now, but is that really a bad thing? We have the epic years with Chester. Chester is missed, & he cannot be replaced. I love AC/DC, but they have two real eras: The Bon Scott years & the Brian Johnson years. Both were magnetic front men who brought different things to the band. This isn't my favorite Linkin Park song by an measure, but it's still a pretty good song. I'm going into this new era of the band with an open mind without forgetting how epic they were with Chester.
Is that the bar from new girl?
This is not LP wtf? 🤢
Anyone talking about the mutiverse these guys just created?
2:12 I thought I heard Chester for a second wth?
WHAT IS NOT TO LOVE??????????????????
Goosebumps? Somebody?! Just me?!😂❤🇧🇷
Did I just hear Chester's voice 2:13 ?
Was that Brad at 0:50 ?
Question? Who wrote this?  Excellent all round
oh alright is this the new song?  oh that is ccool, really dope
Anyone having issues loading the video? It seems to buffer quite a bit :(
Good afternoon, This song belongs to the new album (From Zero)? I am waiting for it.
Another Michael Bay transformers movie on the making?
Breaking the habit?
How many you repeat this song 😅
Can anybody tell me what Mike is painting? That painting shown twice..
Who else hears Chester during the bridge?
Anyone in October 2024?❤😊
Guys... I need some clarification rn....   I think i saw & heard a version of this song with Chester's voice recording before the official release.....    I want to know if it actually happens??
Is that the bar from new girl???
why did they try to fill chesters shoes with this woman lol.
Did you ? Did you just reference 5 different song's in a row? :  Already pulling me in
Is ‘The Emptiness Machine’ a reference to Scientology? The way Emily screams those lyrics sure makes it sound like it for me.
if she can sing this well, if she has such a good voice, can someone explain me why is she doing such a bad job with the classic songs, why is she changing melodic voices in to a very poor gutural like try?
Who the hell is that Sheila, she killin it..!!
0:46 Is that mimic from All You Need Is Kill?
wtf is this Everence?
Anybody still watching in 2024?
When did this come out
Anyone else think that the female vocalist was Lizzy Hale?
I have a question, do you also listen to your old songs?
why so f...n naive?
Where are you, now Chester? 😢
Does anyone else hear Chester's scream at 0:46?
Waaaaait. That's the bar from "New Girl" or not? Where Nick works :D
she's not a replacement? She's trying awfully hard to sound like him. Don't get me wrong, love the new sound,  but it's naive to say they aren't trying to replace him.
Lyrics got me thinking.  What are the emptiness machines in your lifes?
Who is the new chick? She's got a hell of a voice.
Am I the only one who thinks that at some point they should pay tribute to Chester in some song?
Is it me or is she brifely turning into chester at the very end.. When there's a twisting turn of pixels around her face? @3.05
Can somebody please undo the witchcraft of listening to this song in "repeat" the whole day? 😉💯🥇
Is this a diss track for scientology?
What's this? I just came across this song just now. What a POWER! That's just great! This powerful woman's voice just makes my day! And what a song! Congrats !!!🎉🎉🎉
Anybody else here at first hated this and now has come back multiple times since the original hate to not loving this song?
Is this song about the critics?
Isn't this the bar from New Girl?
Is this nick miller's bar from New girl?
Is this Paramore? because this is NOT Linkin Park!!!
Who's here in October 2024?
Is Scientology the emptiness machine? That would be kinda deep if so
Who else is replaying this song over and over again because of how good it is?
Do you guys also notice the subtle Chester screams during the soft Mike Shinoda vocals part? During "Don't know why I'm hoping" I swear I hear the Chester screams and I absolutely love this detail.
Linkin Park's return is crazy!! It's me? At 1:13, is the "B" in "been" saturated?
She sounds like him but young yk what i mean?
Am I the only one that refreshed several times at 00:48 because they though the player/video is glitching?
Have you ever heard "saint loco" from Indonesia?
Did she turn into Chester in the end?? or am I just seeing things??
is that the same bar that's in New Girl?
amazing arrangement and happy to hear these LP vibes again, but am I the only one who has a problem with the lyrics? do we still need such lyrics? how bout going the next step also lyrically? I always see Mike's smile, which makes me happy, but how can you smile on stage, while singing such lyrics .... anyways keep it up, looking forward to the future <3
So does this mean no more Dead Sara?
Can someone make an AI cover with Chesters voice replacing hers? :D
Emily Amstrong, Dead Sara Vocalist??
1:37 How can you listen to that and no be entranced? This song is amazing, and Emily is a fantastic vocalist.
Do you know what I really love Lincoln Park with Chester in it. that's for sure but I'd be lying to myself. If I said, I don't like this music I like it and I'm gonna embrace it with her.
Who can replace Chester? Noone! But Fuxk it it's so close
Why insisting with vfx imitating low graphic vram😅
Is that the bar from "New Girl"?
Is it the voice of Chester 2:11?🥲
Why am I crying???
Could someone explain to me more about the meaning of the music. Is it a suicide song?
Is there a season pass?
does anyone else here chesters at 2:13?
Is it just me or someone else also  felt vibe of Chester Bennington in her?
Aside the discourse around everything, has anyone else noticed that Shoda's voice has improved too over the years in a non-rap-eee way?
is that Mike Shinoda??
People need to think. what are they supposed to do if they wish to continue during live concerts? Pull Chester’s body onto stage with a gurney and use his mouth as a puppet? Theyre not replacing Chester. Theyre pushing forward his legacy.
Is that the bar from New Girl?!
How many special effects do you want in the video? Linkin Park: Yes
Does Emily morph into Chester at @3:09 for a split second? 🥹
Who the hell is she?
Why does she sound so good??!!
At 1:36-1:50 was that a Kurt Cobain reverence? 🤔Maybe it was just the sweater. lol
is there henry cavill in the video?
What new chapter?
Wat is this????? 😮😮😮wat a come back❤❤❤
Paramore is that you? Linkin park new sound is more like punk than real Linkin Park with Chester...
Chester.. are you here?
2:14 is that Kurt cobain?
what!?.....who is this girl?!!!!
is it just me or am i noticing things in the video i didnt before lol.
whats the name of the new band?
Awesome.  How is the girl?
Why is nobody hating on this
As a new piece of studio recorded music, this is really cool.  Linkin Park... Live.... Old material performed live....?? It's a big no for me personally
They were with us, in our darker times. When we needed them the most. Now, are we there for them, when they need us the most? Well, i am already there!
I think this is cool, but why re use the band's name? ah yeah... $$
I want to see if im the only one (There's no hate i'm just curious  I'm fan of Linkin Park since the beginning i was supposed to see them in 2017 unfortunately the tragedy has happened so the show was cancelled and we all know nobody can replace chester But my question is  , is it only me who really don't like the voice of the new signer?
Does anyone else hear Chester’s scream at 46 seconds? And possibly at 36 seconds?  Or, is it just a sound effect?
Now, That Chester Bennington is gone and Emily Armstrong of Dead Sara returns to sender?
anyone else can’t get the song out of their head?
did they sample in a chester scream at 0:46 ?
Is that the bar from New Girl??
Is that your crown? Fu
0:48 Is there a Chester scream buried in the mix?
Oh crap, is Linkin Park good again for the first time since 2003?
when is the concert going to Indonesia?  😮😮
3:05 is that a chester easter egg?
I'm not sure I get the video blur that wipes the entire video during the breakdown about 2/3 if the way through. Has anyone got an idea what it means?
Why is this video 2 hours long?
Is it me or does Emily give me a 21st century feeling of Stevie nicks?
Why am I crying 😭😭
Why not start a new band??
Who is listening to Linkin Park in 2024 year?
Im the only one with repeat?
Replacing Chester with someone who doesn't believe in psychological disorders and psychiatrists ? No one seeing any irony ?
i love this new song.. but can you please not sing Chester's songs? no disrespect but i think that she's not able to sing those songs.. instead you can use AI for those songs. we wouldn't complain
Why does this sound a LOT like Castle of Glass?
Is that Simon Pegg and Sebastion Vettel in the video
Do the image and the scream have a special link? I find it inspiring 00:46
1B view for the new LP song mates? 🙏
Can we reload from the last save where they were choosing a singer and go with someone else 😭
Yo, is that the bar from New Girl?
Chester Benningtong replaced by a woman why? Nobody can replace Chester Bennington ever period. RIP Chester Bennington you will not be forgoten or replaced.
Is Linkin Park back, bro?
How will this song sound with Chester's voice?
She can rock...but will it work?
You all actually like this? I'm deeply let down, was so excited to jump on and listen to something new from them but this is what I got.
Why do I like it so much? ❤❤❤❤❤
League of Legends worlds song ? :)
Is it me or this song has some anime opening theme feels 😅
How many likes would this video deserve if they could be counted?
Drummer change others? where Rob bourdon?
New lol song ?
so no ones gonna mention the new drummer?
She's basically just a punk version of Billie eilish what separates the two? Just the punk variation? Emily could be a good singer for a different band but linkin park? Doesnt quite fit the role, Chester made the group stand out, I think he would be disappointed.
They've bought all possible commercials over web to promote this generic sound? It could be generated by AI 😂
Did u know that they bought bots to promote it?
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON WITH YOU PEOPLE? The LP project is moving forward that's what matters. I'm looking forward to the new songs, don't worry, no one forgets Chester, but the boys want to move on, enjoy the music and concerts
Who is imaging this song with the voice of him?? 😞
What's with the lyrics dude?? You're obviously being manipulated by narcissists...
Why do I feel Guilty all the Same vibes here?
Is it only me who hears how Chester sings this song💔😭
How many internation Linkin park fan are here after me?😎
Was tht Chester's sampled voice at 2.14? Damn it Mike. Why make us cry. Welcome back LP.

Auto-tune? Jesus wept.
This? Song? At 3:00 minutes? Is .Like..half a song. And..LP? Had there time. I think? This 'genre'? Is pretty kinda dead. Good try and all. But? . Idk. Ots definitely not for me. But? I can respect giving it a Go
Can anyone make another version of Emptiness Machine where Chester and Mike sing together ? 🙏🏼
Waiting for the end?
How good is this 😮
She is like a mix of Gwen Stefani and Chester…. Or is it just me?!
Did anyone else think their screen was messing up? 😂😂
Did anybody else notice that the bar is from the show New Girl?
Is it just me, or anyone feel the anime opening badass intro. Anyone?
What is this? This is Linkin Park?? No never....
NOBODY SAW EMILYS FACE TURNING INTO CHESTERS FACE AT THE VERY END OF THE VIDEO? WHY???
Am I the only person who thinks this song is just mediocre at best?
Arcane s2 soundtrack?
Is Brad still the lead guitar?
at first, I can't say I liked it, but... how to get it out of my head?? help
Now how do I get this song out of my head? Cause wherever I go I listen to it 🤪

Non music related - is she sitting at the bar from New Girl?
The distillers is that you!? 😂😂
Is she done reviewing supercars?

Fort minor next album?
Is Nick miller working at the bar??
Very Amazing she is good but is she better then Chester? (And they said something about point of view "pov" when VR came makes sense!) And chesters face at end
Hybrid theory come true?
They have to be related right?
0:47 is that Chester's scream? Or Emily's?
Wait, Phoenix is bald?!
How it can be so good and so sad at the same time? I love it but I still miss Chester ….
The music is very similar to past LP song especially the chorus, but which song is that? Especially the line "the emptiness machine".
Is this clip from 2004? : ) :)
Is this the new Era? Im glad im a part of both Linkin Park Eras amazed af! And glad u drop the new League of Legends Worlds Song how brutal is this god
Can’t they change the name though? I’m all for them making new music of course, it’s just not Linkin Park anymore.
is that the bar from New Girl that Jake works at?
Lyrics are terrible. Performance? It's like a karaoke/American Idol imitation of LP!
New linkin park🎉❤Also i do have a question and it is , is that one of Chester's daughters?
How ru gna replace lead w a "SCIENTOLOGIST" !??
WHy does the spotify verison of this song have no bass. Omg fix it pleaselol
This is garbage. Wtf were they thinking?
Does Chester appear for a split second right at the last second when Emily turns around? 😮
Can someone help me with the meaning of the song?
Have they started offering dianetics screenings at their shows yet? At least Rob Bourdon has the decency to distance himself from this shameful cash grab. Shame on Mike Shinoda.
Is it okay to have a remix permit?
when did Linkin park turn into Paramore?
Is that the bar from New Girl? 😮
Is that the bar from new girl?
Is it only me who hears Chester's voice in Emily's roar sometimes? 😢

Is this song about Scientology?
Is that the bar from New Girl? 0:52
Its great! but is it still linkin park?
Where's the dude with the lyrics??  P.S.: I've just loved it!!!
Let Chez go, he’s our love forever… but wtf with the video?!? That strange part with mirror… is it new beginning? So why do they all falling apart to pieces?!?
Are we all going to ignore the fact that they paid tribute to Chester right at the end of the video? Right after Em shouts the last word, 3:07 Chester appears or is it just me?
my lyrics video about this song getting copyrighted everytime and blocked from global, but when i check other lyrics videos about this song, they didnt get copyrighted, whats my problem about this situation, how i can fix it, can someone help me please?
Is it weird I can still hear Chester singing this?
Couldn't you have just called the band something different?  Or made new music for Fort Minor??
Legue of Legend soundtrack?
super ugly clip... da fuk you think???
Where are the awesome, heavy riffs? Where is the sound? I miss Hybrid theory, none of their albums came even close.
I found her voice a bit similar to Guano Apes singer ( Sandra Nasic).  Anyone else noticed that too???
WTF.......who cut the onions 🥲?
When are the rest of the band joining the Scientology cult?
Linkin Park? Thought this was Evanescence 🤔
is that the new girl bar?!
why i still hear Chester voice on this song.
Not Chester, No.  But anyone else think Emily's vocals are uncomfortably similar enough to border on bad taste?. I know that's 'their sound', but hmmm, kinda tacky.
She sounds like Guano Apes, right? Love her voice! ✨
Who is watching in 2064?
I keep hearing “final masquerade” anyone else hears that same sound?
what the message of this song? I mean the lyrics.
How many time do you heard this music? Me:"yes"
Music world lol 2024??
Wait...what this I just heard ?...
0:50 Is that Nick's bar from "New Girl" ?
Did anyone count how many times you played this song?
did she get consent from the band to be their singer. would chester be proud or happy about this? is this what he would want
Can someone please make a edit of movie shadow the hedgehog running on water to this song?
So... Question. Is "The Emptiness Machine" the name of the ATM that people DON'T go to withdraw their money for tickets for the new Linkin Park shows?
Do you remember what concerts there were in Russia
and.. where is the rap? i hope they ll do for next song,,,,
did the haters not listen to this song or what ?
Why did you turn off the video in Russia?
Who is still watching after 20M
Guess who's back?? Tell a friend
Linkin Park bringing back the golden age of rock before GTA VI? You are awesome guys 🎸🔥👸🏼
Anybody else hearing Chester in their head singing this song too?
isnt that the same bar from new girl?
Worlds 2024 Main Theme?? I hope so! ❤️😍🔥
Did Linkin Park sacrifice Chester
Why is the opening and beat so familiar, i know ive heard it before and its driving me insane
Also how are their music videos always so amazimg and nostalgic??😢
Deleting comments? Lol
I see Chester's face right at the end...at the back of emilys head....anyone else?
Why is Monroe from grimm in this🤔🤣
How can I do to hit the Like button a trillion times??? ❤❤❤🤘🤘🤘
0:34 am I the only one to notice that it's Chester's scream that has been used as a riser?
Is that the bar from new girl??
Does anyone else hear final masquerade? I can’t help but hear it every time I listen to this song.
Is this how they treated Sammy Hagar? Oh wait...
Does anyone hear Chester's scream/voice 0.45 seconds in? I can hear him and it's bugging me which song!
Who here in 2025??
Lol, is block in Russia?)
2:13 CHESTER?????!?!?!!?!??!?!?!?!!?!
How do I filter out this new garbage from their later albums
0:47 Is this Chester head and the representation of Is mind?
I really like Emily, but what about the scientology allegations? Could you please take a hard stance on that. Thanks
Why does it sound like a song I already heard??
When do you release the new and next album?  I can't handle the anxiety here guys
Why didn’t you guys just use voice with AI and have a hologram of him and all your concerts You could’ve also created him in your music videos with AI
Is it these video break or what 😮 such as art 😮
Is it just me or do Emily and Chester almost look alike?
Jayz gonna do 99 problems collab with her?
Isn't the mastermind of the band Shinoda?Just like The Prodigy,Keith was not the master mind,just the vocal....
How does it feel to be the same band that predict the PS3 5 years before its release and the PS5 pro 5 days before its announcement?
Is it just me, or does this sound like Billy Idols’ Rebell Yell?
... is this a regret song about selling the Soul?
2:13 is that Chester’s voice synthesized? Sounds literally JUST like him 😵‍💫
does anyone hear Chester screaming at 0:46 seconds? Or is it just me?
Whos here in 2024? Lol
How can you pass this as Linkin Park Jeez
I wonder if LP will survive replacing Chester with lead singer who suppored serial r4p1st  from her scientology church
why don't they go under a new name? the music is good, but sounds like a different band. related to, but def not linkin park. seems wrong and a bit desperate to make music under the linkin park moniker without chester.
OK, am I the only one who feels like he is listening to SKILLET right now?
is that the bar from new girl
Bro is that the singer from Paramore?
Did Chester Bennington sing this song (the emptiness Machine)? If so, how is it new? It sound like a different band not Linkin Park.
Am I the only one who thinks this has a Rise Against vibe?
Why is nobody hating
is it just me or are we replacing her vocals in our heads with chesters.
Who's ready to embark on a new journey? I'm ready, let's go guys.
anyone here who comes from ASIA?    Iam from INDONESIA❤🇮🇩🇮🇩
League of Legends songs ? '-' Varus and others
Day 7 of asking to change the bands name! Fort Minor !? Anything. Keep the legacy intact.
I hear Chester's voice between 2:14 and 2:31 is this normal? 😔❤️
Its that women new vokalist for LK??? Nothing to say this is really linkin park...🥺🥺
am i the only one who cant get this song out of my head? on repeat since release <3
Who here in September 2024?
Want to know why she was the best choice?
Is that Lana del Rey at 0.10?
what band is this? and why is it trying to sound like chester ? so bizzare
Anyone else feels the progression to be similar to "Final Masquerade "??.. especially the chorus part..
anyone else think this feels very drum and bass like? its pretty cool.
17 million views? where yall at??? 💀💀
Why would Brad take not part of the live tour? I don’t get it. Is he also gonna leave?
Why do I hear Chester’s voice!!!! 😭😭😭
Another name please?
2:11 omg Chester is that you??? 🥹🥹🥹
Who else REALLY wants to hear Chester sing these lyrics? 😢 Great song!
Okay yes all very good but is this remind anyone else of the Steven universe intro? Like I think it's gotta be the same key or chord progression
Really? This song sounds like Final Masquerade…..
Are my comments being instantly deleted? Lol Shame on you for now allowing negative opinions. What a joke!
Is this a joke?
Why did the band kick Chester Bennington out of the band?  He was a great singer!!
So what was the relation between Emily and Danny Masterson and Scientology?
Shortly Before the PS5 pro Announcement  Coincidence?
The source of the anger around the ‘reunion’ tour ?  It lies in MAINLY TWO elements!
Yeah, where's the guitar solo?
Why is Rob not with the band anymore?
Anyone else thinks some parts of this song resemble final masquerade?
waiting for the end 2.0?
Am i feeling the "Linkin Park" Vibe after a longg longg time?
Anyone felt a Blink182 vibe at the first seconds ?
Where is the extended version of this shear masterpiece?
I just realized she looks a little bit like Chester. Does anyone feeling as me?
Can we have this kind of music back plz and stop with all the bs
Was it really that difficult to form a new band? Because as much as anyone might want it to be its not Linkin Park. Slather it with the name all you like.
In 3:08 Hes a Chester? 😮
Is this league of legends worlds song 2024?
I'm curious, are there any new fans? 😊😅
Is it just me or is there a sample if Chesters scream at 0:45 , it's like his spirit is still in the songs
Can this song back to transformers again...?
Can we get other version of the song using Ai for Chester's voice
does anyone else see/feel a transition from Emily to Chester when she pixelates?
Who thinks shes hot ?
Wtf is this trash ? Horrible music dont insult Chester.
An AU where Linkin Park was never formed?
Why all these people spreading hate about Linkin Park, do you guys ever heard what Chester been singing about?
Is this intentionaly done that the only hiting bit of the piece is sang by the lady? Nice!
I wander what if Chester is here in this song......with their new member..........NUMB? Hmmmmm................
Sounds nice, but kind of empty. Maybe it’s simply a different time, requiring different style of music?
Am I the only one who sees Chester's profile 3:07? Btw Emily has such a powerful voice with pretty much than decent energy and fit for LP. Welcome back aboard folks, the new era is here
Is it just me or does she look like Gwen Stefani mixed with Kate winslet
who else hears "Guilty All the Same" in this song am I going crazy????????????????????
the first minute looks like a lol intro..... or is it my impression? (el primer minuto se parece a un intro de lol ..... o es mi impesion?)
Does anybody have a theory about the meaning of this song? I have mine, does anyone care to know?
Who's still here in 2029?
Is there live stream today?
1:12 is that Eminem? 😅
This sounds me like a claim for the devil. What does the part where the word "altar" is used mean?, and I see reference symbology on the video.
Is it me.. or thats clearly a throw back trough the beat and notes to "final masquarade"? Man they sound so alike.
Can we can just question THE MUSIC? Regardless of the new singer personnal history, the new music is just bad, this is why the return of LP will fail, point blank.
Does my music have potential?
Nana? Is that you?
Why does she remind me of MGK 😅
is this metalcore?
Where is Chester 😅
How do you pick someone to take Chester's place that stands for everything he fought for?
Lol is that the bar from New Girl? 0:54
I wonder how will change the drum part of LP's music.  I mean, it's already a huge difference,  but it will be very interesting to see if Collin could bring this fresh energy in the next projects, without tanking that characteristic LP sound
Love the new song! Completely random is that the bar from new girl? Looks familiar.
is that the bar from New Girl?
Who's supporting before we hit 1.000.000 likes? (After less than a week, wth?)
Song isn't bad. Is the bar Emily is sitting in The Griffin aka the bar Nick works in in New Girl? Sure looks like it.
Is that the bar from New Girl?
Sensing a Korn vibe here ? 🤘
the question is: scientology or not?
Is it just me or does anyone else hear chester’s voice mixed in at 2:14 ?
Why are so many fans afraid of Emely? I can't understand that... it's about the music and not faith or politics... she has a great voice... give her a chance...
Who was Chester? He was a demon at the same time who could sing like an angel...
Is that hummus they're serving?
Is this still a uplifting band ? 😌
Anyone else getting Bon Scott to Brian Johnson vibes?  Like AC/DC is still AC/DC with Johnson, but Bon Scott will always be a part of AC/DC.
is this halestorm with mike shinoda?
Hi Linkin Park, may I know if Taka in this song? cause I hear his voice,from a fans
is this an emo band?
Anyone else had this song on repeat for hours?
future opening of Arcane Netflix? (LoL)
It's just me... Or this song sounds sort off "final mascarade"??? Just saying...😅
3:04 Look closely, the character was Chester Face when Emily turns and spins for one frame.  Like and Comment D: It's real??
is that.. "castle of glass" typa?
Adam from Mythbusters????
Why am I listening to it on repeat? ♥
Did Scientology already schedule the next Armageddon?
Enough about Chester and Emily what about the song do you like it ?
I rly like Emily and the music is dope! but shouldnt they at least rename band as tribute to chester so his life work is seperated chapter?
Nice song but the video?? Not in sync and one doesn't know if there is an effect or problem with the codec?
What if chester sing this song 😮
Is it only me who feels that she has an aura and similarity like Juliet Simms in her early days? Who else sees it that way?
Why is this video length is 3 days? Cant stop listening
dont this song sounds familiar?
can everybody just move on and listening the song
Don't know if Chester would like this tbh
An I the only one getting Guano apes vibes? 👍👍👍
Would you guys please Stop comparing chester and emily? Move on. Can't you just appreciate her voice singing? I love it. Hail from Brazil
How many of you cried when she hits the Chester notes on chorus .
How many times have you replayed this song? Me: Yes
2:15 can you hear him too?
That food looked cold.  Wth, Joe?
Is that Mike Shinoda's voice now? Sounded like what I've heard from AI generated song voices. Emily Armstrong, however, sounds like a good female equivalent for the band, so I'm pleasantly surprised.
Where were the die hard fans after their first three albums? Those albums from 2000, 2003, and 2007 combined sold almost 80 million records worldwide and almost 30 million in the U.S. alone?
Is this really a Paramore cover?
Why Bring Lincoln Park back? Why not create a new band with her the lead singer not (“Dishonoring or honoring”) Chester? His old friends and her start their own.
Is it only me or does it sometimes sounds like we hear chester his screams 0:45
Why is this song giving three days grace vibe?
IDK… was it necessary to mark the comeback with such depressive lyrics? „Let you cut me open just to watch me bleed“?
Why doesn't she sing "be" in pitch
Am I the only one that at 00:46 can hear the scream of Chester? And Mike is portraying his representation
At the end of the day .... why wouldn't the OG LP members know what they are doing? They ran with Chester for forever, and then mourned him for seven years. Like, clearly only they would know how to best honor Chester.
Why too many haters because a girl as new singer ? It’s really good 👍🏻
Am I the only one who doesnt like the new vocalist?..She seems a bit aggressive where she needs to be calm
Hey guys i discovered something, At second 45 it is a scream, It sounds like Chester's scream or i am wrong???Or it is Emili's scream???
what?.... i mean it's not chester, but i'm in.
Wouldn't this have been a great time to start a new project? Bands undergo line up changes all the time but this one is weird for me. Purely subjective I know but there's something I couldn't get passed enough to fully enjoy the song, great as it is. Glad it's doing it for people though.
It’s not bad but would I actually listen to it? I’m here a second time to be sure and I don’t think I want to hear this again.
The question is, when are you coming to Mexico?
Melhor musica em 2024?  -  Best song of 2024?
Is it prototype of the Reaper Leviathan from Subnautica only the picture?😮
3:07 does anyone else see Chester in this frame?
Oh is that girl who have a pdf file bf?
Does 0:46 is a tribute for chester's scream? Or just a part of the song
and where is LP here? empty generic music
Arcane 2 soundtrack?

Whats her name? Wow what a voice!
She's new members?
Who's the male singer though?
How many times have you played that song? "Yes!" 🤣😍😍😍😍😍
this mv is really bad wtf warner?
Has anybody looked up who she is and where she is from????!!
How come they copy each other's Eyes? 😅
interestiing track name.. emptiness machine, what could it mean? anyone can hint ?
Is this the new album of the Paramore? Then I would like to ear the woman without auto tune...
Who else enjoyed this new song 👉
Why pre order can not shipping to Indonesia?😢
Why is not Danny Masteson part of the video cast? Oh right he is in jail, at least some Scientology iconography to make honor to the new singer will be nice
Linkin park featuring halestorm?
Am I the only one who saw Chester cameo in bar beside Emily ?
Ok, now that I've stopped crying... Mike are you selling the painting? Even a print on cotton. Love it :)
QUESTION for Emily: If someone is having thoughts of self-harm, do you support them seeking out help from a mental health professional like a psychologist or psychiatrist?
I wonder how this would sound if I was to use ai for a replacement as Chesters voice however this new chick's good
How do they make this video feel like it was shot in the 2000s? Has that whole feel to it apart from the modern HD.
Someone Ai cover with Chester's voice? 😬😅😅😅 Edit: They already made one 😅
When will the track come out so that I can download it?
who wrote lyric of this song?
this new paramore?
Does anyone else feel she looks like Ray Gunn?
2:14  is that Chester voice? 🥺
Knock knock... Arcane 2? Maybe soundtrack?
In the 46-47 sec of the song, is it just me or can you hear Chester screaming?
Hi fanbase! do you know Victor Borba?
Why did he bring back linkin park? can’t mike make a different band name? It just feels like a mike Shinoda colab
how do I stop watching?
Who is here before worlds 2024 song drops?
Lol, why don't you just start a new band then instead of riding on the coattails of your old band name? 😂
Might be unrelated but is the bar the same set as from New Girl? It looks a lot like it lol
Who's here for Linkin Park?
Isn't that the bar from New Girl
0:47 I'm rather curious about this drawing. I feel that it's more important to the song that it appears. When its face's showed up, we saw the first "Matrix glitch" in the videoclip. Strangely, the creature's portrait is seen once more in the last part of the video (2:30), in a moment which every LP's components already got rid of them "personas" from the beginning of the videoclip (The painter, the mailman, the officeman, etc.), which means that the portrait wasn't important that moment. However, the camera shows it with a zoom. Only an aesthetic choice? Maybe. Another curious coincidence: The monster is, essentially, a painting, while From Zero's cover is, essentially, ink.  I've just noticed some points, but I haven't built any theory about it yet. Is this creature a representation of our inner devils? Or of that specific person mentioned in the lyrics, who "lets the others cut themselves open just to watch they bleed"?  Probably it's only my immagination, but it will be awesome if these ideas, represented by the monster, come back in other From Zero's tracks, turning it a kind of concept album, like "A thousand Suns".
Why I wanna cry when I listen to this song? I am sad that Chester in not in this song, but so happy to be present to LINKING PARK REBORN
Is...anyone gonna have introspection? I meean
At 2:13 and 2:23 is that just her or is there some light AI? Sounds a lot like Chester when he starts to scream.
Ok what magic sauce did they put into this song? I have had it on loop any chance I get. On here and on spotify
Who else is getting Guano Apes vibes from this ????
*QUESTION 4 EMILY*  "If someone you know is having thoughts of self harm, what would you say if they wanted help and asked to talk to a councilor or psychiatrist"  UR ANTI PSYCHOLOGY so WTF r u upto??
Why is this called linkin park? Its completely different music, why not change the name?
Is this really the best that could be found with such a terrible weak voice?
Is it just me or do I hear a lot of similarities during the chorus with Final Masquerade?
Why do I always cry when I hear these songs? Because I'm happy because they're back? Because they're just incredible? Because it's pure Linkin Park?
But why do I cry when Emily sings the chorus? I don't understand.
When should we expect a song called "Dancing On The Ashes" dedicaded to you dancing on Chester's,and what once was Linkin Park, ashes??
I can hear chester voice in this song howw??❤❤
Intro for Arcane Season 2? 😍
So is this just showing why they got it back together? Cause they had to go get real jobs and realized, hey,this sucks, lets milk this thing dry
So, when does the new Xbox come out???
0:46 - What does this art represent? Is it a mascot for the band? Or just a representation for this video? I thought this monster was really cool.
Paramore or Evanescence? I still can't decide which cover they're trying to follow
I wonder if someone can just ai chesters voice overhears for any future songs they make lol.
Emily what are you!? ❤️🔥
Give me kinda League of Legends Vibes ?
Is this a hunting party bonus track?
Am i crazy or do they talk about what i think ?
Dunno if I'm imagining this, but is it Chester's face at 3:07 ?
Why is this new band called Linkin Park? I don't get it.
can someone remake this with chester ai vocals so i can see which one i like better? edit: nvm found one
why not just go by a different band name when theyve literally done it before
Was this originally written by Chester n never used, or possibly another band mate??? Bc the lyrics are very similar to how n what Chester Bennington would say
I mean, i don't fully hate her, she sounds great, but man. Why her? With her past? To replace Chester? Wtf world did I wake up in? Why tf am i the o ly one here freakin out?
Could you guys release a clean version of this too?
Is it weird that i prefer Emily over Mike singing?
after the 100th time im seeing this video, im starting to catch some referencies to other video like crawilng, in the end and others...am i imagining it ??? ❤
Anybody else notice that at 3:08 Emily kinda looks a little like Chester?
Isn’t she… is she… chester bennington’s daughter, is she? isn’t she? I am so crying now!!!!
Am I the only one who cried seeing the live show on YouTube? Mike seemed so happy
AND THE SONG IS 3:20 LONG? MIKE YOU BEAUTIFUL PERSON
Why am I hearing Chester's voice over her voice?
Is she supercar blondie ? 😅
Am I the only one that's so emotional right now?
Why can't they just make a new band? Riding on the fame of a dead person just feels cash-grabby.
Is the rumor true that the guitarist from Linkin Park is leaving the band?
What if chester sing this song😢?
Theories on what “the emptiness machine” is?
How about her connections to Scientology?
I'm I crazy or is it in the end at 3.08 I'm seeing Chester in Emily??
So.. what about Scientology Emily? Why keeping quiet?
Is it just me, but the lyrics are talking about us the 🪭?
Could you come to Thailand for a concert tour? If you really come, I will buy tickets. ❤
Is this album gonna officially be released on Nov 15th? The same day as ASSassin's creed Shadow,  can't wait to see them both!
Why the new singerin looks a little bit like Dr. Molly Clock from Scrubs?
WTF is this?? I thought it was an ad , i skipped it then realized its the song itself. 😢
Why are you crying? I'm not crying 😭😭😭. Another chapter opens 🔥🔥🔥
wait wait wait, at 03:07, Chester takes place of Emily which turns back like he is leaving the stage?
the og drummer left the band ?
3 days and only 11.2 mil views? Really? Stop slacking people.
Am I the only one hearing heavily compressed Chester's scream sample at 0:45 while the monster Mike is painting is trying to get out?
Why does this loop perfectly tho?
Where’s Chester?
Why chester suicide tho? Does he don't value life? U only live once n he choose to end his life🤦🏻‍♂️ That's pathetic way to die
Are we number one yet?
Was Lzzy Hale not available? Very similar singing style. My issue is with this new lead singer live....if it had been an American Idol performance Simon would have torn her apart.
Do you know how Brad Delson got himself a courier job at UPS?  He applied with LinkedIn Park!
0:45 Was that Chester in the background? Or am I just being delusional? 😢  Also it synced with "Don't know why I'm hoping for what I won't receive" - It ached my heart cause the song is telling me I would never be able to hear Chester's voice again... Ahhhhhhhhh....
Am I the only one hearing Chester’s scream? Here 0:45 RIP
So, where are all those guys that loves to play with a lot of AI apps, I don't see them taking this song and replacing her voice with Chester's, just as a game? Insane and creepy, isn't it?
what is this song's about? the AI art thingy?
Amazing! When do you guys come to Brazil? 😬
can I have a new album please?
Linkin Park aren’t you guys coming to Toronto ? Pls 😢 I will be waiting on you !
Is she a scientologist?
Was Lauren Babic ever on your radar for this role?
whos got AI who can recreate this song her vocals being sung by someone who sounds similar to chester? Dakota Butler would have been stellar
Welcome back, guys, and welcome to Emily, great voice, girl! love the song, can't wait for the album! Question though - will there be a tour in 2025?
When is the album out?
Is this song about being part of a cult?
This is LP or Evanescence? But not bad, i like it
what country is this? Philippines?
I don’t get it? It’s not good
Where is the rest of the new album. I'm ansious to listen all the new songs!
All comparisons to Chester aside, Does anyone else get a hint of Kurt Cobain from Emily's voice or is it just me?
Remember how you used to be? When you barbequed burgers and ribs?
Am i the only one who sees Chester at 1’06 when the photos scroll ends ? 👀
Is this Emily  Targaryen?
Anyone from 2026 here?
Is this Caster Bennington from another multiverse or something?
Guess Who Is Back?? 😭🔥🔥🔥
Who is here in 2029?🎉
Who is here in 2029? 😂
Why do ppl hate this?
Do you feel anything? I feel nothing.🫠
Are they change the drummer?
now ask yourself critics and haters, what if you keep going and suddenly linkin park drops the female singer, and suddenly dies off again like it did when the band lost the infamous chester, you gonna suddenly cry that the band ruined themselves? no, if that happens you are to blame.
Is still Brad here?
Mike: is there any fans left?  10mil views on 2day lol
Emily sounds awesome! Am I the only one that thinks her sing-screams sound a lot like Lzzy Hale?
Is it just me who thinks Chester is at 3:07?
Honestly? I keep listening to the new single and it's merely because I really like her voice. Keep it up, Emily.
Emily Armstrong becoming chester at the clip on 3:07?
Emily is Cobain lost daughter?,)
why do videos suck now
why do i'm getting  one ok rock vibe on instruments style?
Okay where is the ai chester correction?
Is this the new singer? Or just a guest? If shes the new one, good on them. Vibe is the same as ever and I dig it
Do you guys think this is like a "One last time" thing? Doing an album and tour for one final time before permanently breaking up?
I like the lead singer but what's the rest of the band doing? I mean this song doesn't really sound like Linkin Park tho', does it?
Next need for speed song ? 🤔
Rob?  Where's Rob?? 😢
did anyone notice how emily in the end glitches into chester? and how other bandmates did too at times? or maybe I am wrong.
Where's the people who can change voices with IA?
...is that the bar from New Girl?
What happened to their former drummer?
Enyone  heard this song in Chester's voice like me?
why am I addicted to this?
Alright real funny you guys...When does the real singer come out? ❤
Who watching this is 2225?
Why cant the haters just be glad they are moving forward just not forgetting whats not happening and what can actually be?
I had this song on repeat ever since it was dropped and i don't know if it's just me but i can sense the presence of chester in it, he is there in every part of the song with his soul and i can also hear his voice on it i don't know if i'm delusional or anyone else is feeling the same?
Where is the GODLIKE button?
Linkin Park resurrection? 🤔👍👍👍🤘🤘🤘
What is this? Paramoooooooree?
Can someone make AI version with chester’s voice ?
Is the guitar guy the same or he was replaced too ??
Why sounds like Paramore?
Can anyone make this song on Chester voice with the help of A.I.
she`s holding back, why?
WTF is this trash? Give it up already...
This is pop? Why?
What venue was this awesome performance ? Luv it Emily brings the sick vocals!!
Is it just me or does this track keep getting better and better with each new listen?
Why not just recreate Chesters Voice with Ai?
Why didn't this band make chester tribute music video????
Didn't she back Danny Masterson during his S/A trial? This is who you chose to replace a man that we all loved and dearly miss that stood against assaults towards women and children. 😢
Is the church of scientology financing the new tour?
Who wrote this song?
Any of you guys have limewire? I just downloaded the mp3 from napster and got taylor swift instead. Tough world
You think emily is chester's legacy?🤔
Will we get a Remake of Meteora with Emily ?
Is that restart of ,,Guano Apes,,? .... Rubbisshhhh
From Cult Band to Cult?
Why they even call this band Linkin Park? It's clearly not that anymore. C'mon guys. That's sad... 👎
How long can she sing like that with that pitch? Wow!
What about making an album with the best LP songs with Emily..
is this the Bar from the Series NEW GIRL?
Who reunites next? Nirvana?
Does anyone notice Chester's vocal layer at 2:11?
Damn who let that lady cook???
Why do you practice Russophobia?
Am I 13 again? Such a vibe and emotion, welcome back LP.
is this song about being born into a cult?
Should we call her emily Bennington? Shes rock well 👍
In this moment?
Why not change the bands name and leave it as it was. It’s not the same band at all, the dynamics are wildly different it’s hard to even call it moving on or evolving. It doesn’t sound bad it just doesn’t make sense.
I hear this song but why do I imagining chester voice sing this song? this is the best decision to make emily the lead vocal, can't wait the new album...
Maaan wtf is this trash?? It's certainly not Linkin Park in any, way shape or form smdh. CHANGE THE NAME
Is it just me or they sound more like One OK Rock now?
Is 2009 back again😢 still remember the first English song i heard "In the End" and that's how i fell in love with their music 🫡
Shes the the new vocalist replacing Chester?? She sounds good
Can somebody put Chester's voice with AI in this song please
Who else will be here in 2064
What hapenned to Rob?
Can someone explain what tiktok has to do with anything?
Can AI do it Chester sing this song???😢
What happened to Rob Bourdon?
2:13 How many of you could hear Chester here? It sounded like he was singing!
How many distorted effects do we want in this video? Mike: *Yes*
The new LOL Worlds theme?
Why dont Linkin Park just Ai Chester’s voice
My teenage years coming back 20 years later? Thank you..
Linkin Avenue? We’ve definitely wandered far from the park at this point
Did any1 notice how whose couple of thousands likes bots use words? NEW LINKIN PARK ETC. pathetic agenda bots
Wait. Was that Chester at the end? 😢
wtf is this crap?
Paramore? You should change the name of the band this is not linkin park
There are hundreds singers better than her… Guys, why?…
Is that a female Chester? I'm from Manchester and I feel offended. Jokes aside I'm glad my favourite band is recovering and this is a good song
Is that the bar from New Girl?
Wow wtf… Who is this chick?
Does Shinoda know what a Scientologist whack job his new singer is?? Seriously, everything LP used to stand for was against being in a CULT. 😡🤬🖕🏼
Linkin Park feat. Halestorm?
Not the same sorry horrible what you guys don't have enough money or what??? What is this all about?
Who can replace Chester ? … I must admit Emily is a very good successor and I really love female hard rock singer (even if she has serious controversy’s especially with Scientology church)
Chester? Oh right... Mhm... Not the same anymore... Just be honest thats it... Miss his voice... His voice emotional... Gave deep feelings in hearts... Her voice idk I feel nothing...
2:49 and 2:57 Anyone notice the platform they're on at the end is the same one from the livestream?
Who is your Linkin Park bias?!
Are we forgetting that Emily is a Scientologist who vehemently supported Danny Masterson through his rape convictions and tried to suppress the testimony of his victims?  I'm pretty sure Chester would not approve.
Wasn’t this chick the one who was trying to intimidate Danny Masterson’s victim at the courthouse? I’m pretty sure it is.
How do I upload my resume to LinkedIn Park? I was expecting instructions or a how too, but it's just singing 😞
How many times are they going to make the same song
A female lead vocalist? Really?😒
Don't know how to feel... something between heart breaking and really good song 😱🤯
Female version of Chester?
Has Mike ever proven himself to be as talented at singing as he is rapping?
I heard Chester’s voice at 3:01  in the background or im just high?😭
Not sure whats the problem, is it me? I fast forwarded the song and just tried to listen to few bits, i know chester is missing but apart from chester, feels like composition wise something is missing. Hope the other tracks will be good
Does anyone else think it would be awesome to hear Chester, Mike and Emily together? 🤍
So Brad is still in the band, but just not touring right?
Why even bring up Chester? sounds amazing. Love it 1:34
What the skibidi movie?!!
What symbolizes that painting???
R.I.P. Chester... Do people really believe Chester would just want all these people to lose their main source of income? Geez people chill it's a good song.
Is there a part of Chester's voice? The last hook sounds kinda like a mix of Chester and Emily
Are they using autotune now?
It's clear that she needs a room to breathe. Why should it be her? Why don't they look for a male vocalist who can take a long breath and not crack halfway? Anyway, congrats on the comeback.
Why am I crying ? Am I happy ? Am I sad ? Idk
is this a sign of alternative rocks era comeback?, after a decade being bored of pop, edm and R&B
Is that lizzy?
Scientologist in LP? Hell why?
Will we be seeing colabs with other artists like you’ve done in the past?  I am excited to see the new music that’s coming.
Anyone else feel like the drumbs are kinda....basic?
How many of you know that the old name of Linkin park is actually "Xero" or Zero? So, the title "From Zero" makes a lot of sense. Doesn’t it?
Are they at The Griffin?!
1:28 im the only one hearing "across the line" vibes?
The beat of.... castle of glass?
IS THAT THE GRYFFIN BAR FROM 'NEW GIRL'?
Sandra Nasic might have been a better choice( Who in the hell is Sandra Nasic?😅)
Why is it so good
How isn’t this on trending???
Where in the hell is the LOVE IT button??!!
why a new vocalist? mike was fine :/
I'm just wondering if this song is in archive? And chester is in instead of emely? I wonder what will it sound. Just wondering.
Is that chester at the end of the video in her position? 3:06
Why am I crying? 🥲❤️
This is trash. What is this edgy pop rock?
Is it just me? Or the resemblance of Kurt and Chester stirs in the video.
0:32 is he at the back of Bada Bing? lol
Who's still here in 2024?
breaking the habbit??
Why a woman?
Is this what they call E-Meters now?
Can we get a tour with Evanescence and Halestorm?
she gave the same kind of energy as late chester...or is it only me?
Who is that girl??
Is  it OK to cry while watching this?
Who's this music for? Millionaires crying about being part of something seems disingenuous.
Is it just me or does this sound kinda like castle of glass?
She's great. But can she do the Given Up Scream ?
Does anyone else hear the different aspects, the entire song has sounds from each album theyve done. If you listen carefully
3:07 did she just turn into Chester for a split second there? specifically the blonde Chester with the black shirt, from Numb.
This is a joke right 😂😂 a chic singer??? No way 😢
so how much is Scientology making off on this ?
I wonder did Zenu help her write this song?
Who paints with lights off?
When the painting moves, is that Chester's scream from the ending of Pts.Of.Arthrty?
Sooo... when are you guys going to address the fact that in a place of a beloved vocalist, who's been victim of sa and who struggled with mental illness, you picked up someone who allegedly not only believes in scientology, so doesn't believe in psychology, but also supported a r*pist in a court?
is this a dnb?
Native speakers pls tell me does Emily have a typical Californian accent? As non native speaker I thought she was Australian or smth but I couldn’t imagine she was from LA.
Was that Smells Like Teen Spirit video-vibe when she sang?
Why am I crying?
Who she sleeping with
How many views in a day? 😮👍🏼🔥
Is that her, or Chester at 2:20?
can't stop listening to it , dk why
Wow. How can  someone that  calls himself a singer be so bad at it? 😢
Why am I crying?
she aint chester but she knows the linkin park vibe you know what i mean right in your  head ur feel like it feels right am i wrong ?
Tf even is this? lol
Guys, am crying, is that normal? , it's a tears of happiness 😞❤
New or old?😢
When will the song appear in Beat Saber?) 🎉🎉🎉
What the name is new album?
I wonder what if hybrid theory bring this song on their live show
Like it. Is there a deeper meaning in the lyrics?
It’s new cover band?
Can they make a new name band? Dang linkin park was a core. Now it became a paramore type with sadboy rapper type of band
No one realizing it’s kinda ripoff version of Final Masquerade?😄
LP recalled my teenage days🔥🔥 90's babies where you at? 🤟🏻😎🤘🏻
Emily is great, but did linkin park now that she is could or could not be scientologist still? SMH
Just close your eyes and listen to 2:12-2:24 part. Whom vocal is it?
Why has nobody realised that she is a crazy scientologist and a rapist sympathiser???  The whole vibe woth scientology is that they don't believe in mental health which is what LP is at its core. Seems like some serious research was missed
Why this feels like a perfect Arcane Session 2 song?
Am I the only one who is getting some slight oldschool Guano Apes vibes from Emily's part?
Why am I in tears? And why am I putting this on loop for an hour now? 😭  Welcome back LP, Chester will be forever in our hearts ❤
Is it just me or is that bar the same bar from The New Girl?
Alright guys... my favourite part of LP song, THE BREAKDOWN! What do you think the song means guys? Or how do you interpret it personally?
Why did you simply start copying Skillet from the original sound of Linkin Park?
Why do I hear Chester's voice in her?
I love the song, but is it just me that can't unhear "the final masquerade" during the chorus?
Is it just me, but when  both vocals sing blend, its almost you can hear chesters voice come through... Emiliy has started a new chapter for linkin park ❤❤
Why did you hire a rapist defender and enabler to sing when the person she replaced was abused?
1:38  Am I the only one that started hearing "Dino rangers roar! Power Rangers Score!" in the back of my head?
Ready to give her the chance? For sure.... Love for Chester is eternal though❤❤❤
am I crazy or was that transition at the end supposed to be a glimmer of Chester?
Why not make a new band this dampers
Why would you make a scientologist your new lead vocalist?
Is this gonna make era of band coming back??🔥🔥🔥
What the hell is this 😔😔😔
She is mimicking chesters vocal patterns and style. Is it a bit different yes?? But she is not replacing chester. She is carrying on his legacy by keeping linkin park's music alive.
WHAT HAPPENED to rob bourdon???
Anyone know why Brad isn't putting on his headphones anymore? (even during the live performance)
Why does it feel like i hear Chester when she screams?😢
Would it hurt for them to mix in rap and rock with lyrics? That was the defining factor of Linkin Park. Great to see the new vocalist and new music, but wish Mike would rap again. They sound more like a generic alt pop rock band now.
Is 2:13 for a split second using Chester prerecorded voice as backing vocals or am I hallucinating it because my mind wants me to??
What is this? Paramore? The song sounds like something old Paramore would write and the female singer Emily Armstrong sounds like Hayley Williams
Anyone else holding back tears of happiness?
I wonder if anyone can do an AI voice replacement on this track to see how it sounds with Chester’s voice in it 🙈 Jokes aside, LP is always evolving, just like all of us growing up and experiencing different stage in lives and have new perspectives, I learn to be at peace with Chester not being here, the band took 7 years to finally healed and move on (kudos to Mike) most band would ultimately disband and members would just go separate ways. I personally want LP to live forever, especially since their songs have been an important part of my life, I hope everyone can accept the band’s new direction, but if you don’t like what you hear simply walk away.
Is it a tribute band?????  Why is this not LP? 😅
Is the familiar sound of Linkin Park yet a bit more screamo maybe? I like it, is just like i'd been listen her for years already
Am i crazy? Why i listen a little piece of chester in her? I'm not comparing them, but damn... The feeling is very crazy...
Can we hear from Rob? Is he okay?
Definitely still linkin park vibes! I approve! Actually I love it it! One question.. what took so damn long? 🙌
So how are they going to play the old songs live? Cause all I want to hear is Chester
Obsessed with this song. Also are we not gonna talk about them using Nick’s bar from New Girl in the video?? Lmao ☠️
Is no one going to mention that this song is a re written version of given up from minutes to midnight….listen to the drums
1 question. Is she still friends with Danny Masterson?
Who's the lady vocalist??? 😮
What is the difficulty in writing new lyrics, 3D projection of Chester, Chester’s voice through neural networks and forward new songs.
Is it me but I here Chester's voice is a faint in the background
Big brain time: is Mike painting Xenu?
Has anyone made an AI version of this yet with Chester?
where is brad ?
Picked a Scientologist to replace Chester? She supports everything Chester was against. LP, shame on you.
Did I hear a snippet of Cheaters vocals in there 🥹❤️
2:12 anyone else very briefly heard Chester's voice in Emily's?
Any idea why she still follows Masterson's IG despite it (her account) only having like half a dozen grams on it? Will she ever speak on this?
uhm also i think the song can be longer? didn't get enough Emily XD
Why Linkin Park, why???? 😢😢😢 We all know Chester's childhood history and you put a Danny Masterson supporter as your lead.
Dammm when does a cool guitar solo or epic turntable mix something Linki kicks in!?
Why Linkin Park not invite "Ivo Rosario" from Hybrid Theory LP tribute band to join as lead singer replace Chester? Ivo Rosario has voice, style & vibes almost 90% like Chester... Please bring him to the Linkin Park!!!!!!
Is this a collaboration with Scientology?
Is it just me or it sounds a little like the final masquerade?
Wow. Why does the music video sound way better than the audio versionon spotify?
Who is the new member? I like what she brings to the table.
this is Link Park or  Evanescense? 😵‍💫⚰️
Why do I feel like I already know this song?❤
What's the painting?
Lots of negativity and hate in the comments. Just.... why?
So this is the new Paramore song?
Not bad. What do you have in store for us?
Did Shinoda draw Marvel’s The Void? Could this be featured on the Thunderbolts movie?!
who is in tears?
It's only been 7 years and you guys replace Chester? That's too soon. Why didn't you just disband instead of creating whatever this is? I guess you will do whatever if you're desperate for money, huh? Maybe this will do us all a favor and fail. We can hope anyway.
Is that the bar from New Girl?
Do all the members of Linkin Park support rapists? Or is it just their new singer?
is it only me who feels the presence of CB? it feels like Emily is the female version of him.
Didn't she support Danny Masterson during his r*pe trial? And wasn't Chester a victim of r*pe?
Is it just me... or do the instruments not hit as hard as they need to? Its great. Im loving this. No hate... just those drums feels weak, the guitar a bit... powerless..?
Why not Ivo Rosario?
IS IT LINKIN PARK OR PARAMORE
How do you think Chester would react to his replacement being a Scientologist who steadfastly support's Danny Masterson, a convicted rapist?? You guys should be ashamed of yourselves.
Yep, she's not Chester, and what? I think enough time passed by to try to start a new chapter.
League Of Legends Worlds 2024?
Could it have been better? Could it have been crazier? LP forever ❤
How could they replace chester
Is she bangable? That's all that matters to me..
Why is the woman it’s not racing is missing Chester Bennington😢
From the moment Emily Armstrong started singing, I had goosebumps Chester, are you up there singing along and tapping your feet to the beat? 🫶
Is it just my impression or this song talks about chester?? Anyway this girl has balls and fits right for a new chapter
No one can replace Chester but I am okay with this alternative. I just wonder what will they do with old stuff in like future concerts, will she sing Chester's parts or will they not play any old stuff anymore?
Why her voice is so good in here but on live she sounds like a dying hedgehog?
Why do I have tears streaming down my face right now?
This actually fucks, what the hell?
You guys ready for Linkin Park 2? hehe
What happen to the original drummer, Rob Bourden? Is he not part of the band anymore?
IS THIS A VACUUM COMERCIAL
Can't deny love the song, but I'm still torn on the use of the LP brand without Chester
Who's the girl? She sings freaking awesome!
Who is this woman
Something from Linkin Park?
Linkin park comeback anyone???
I love it .. I'm here for it.... BUT why couldn't they just create a new band name like they did with nirvana after Kurt died and created foo fighters?!
Wait this isn't a hidden track is LP coming back?
Somehow I liked the live version of this particular song much more. Does it have more drive in there?
Who's the female singer? She sounds great
Is it me or does this sound muffed  and low quality audio?? Sounds bad on my car speakers and it's making me mad  Edited: So I'm sad and my speakers finally blew 😢
am i the only one to tear up hearing this song? it's like the old band is back again
I'm sorry it just sounds boring to me right now :( maybe later itll sound more hardcore?
How come Shinoda is the only one who kept being creative (painting), and the video portrays everyone else in the band in a dead-end job?
Is anyone else thinking that's Chester screaming at @0:46 ?
Is Linkin Park pro-rape by Danny Masterson or is it just their lead singer?
Is it just me or does her voice kind off sound like chesters voice but sped up😀😀
Anyone know, why drummer Rob isn't with them anymore?
Did someone notice that Emily is a female version of Chester? She looks very much like him somehow. And I like it
Masterpiece without a Doubt. But why is this recorded with sound like in 360p-480p?. Have to turn it up alot and soundquality is really bad. 😔
Is that lady a new member of the band? i really like her voice
Are you guys scientologists now? 😕
Am I the only one who noticed Chester's face in this fast forwarding of faces? 1:05
What the hell happened with Rob??
How many people cried?? Damn. The live stream last night had me crying like a baby. LFG!
why dont only use AI to replicate chester voice ??
am I the only one not feeling this? its just seems weird to me its like if STP tried to do new stuff without their lead
It still hurts... but welcome back guys. Chester do u see this? 🥲
Wait. Is that the bar from New Girl?
can someone ai this to chester version>? please
Linkin park is alternative now?
how come mike is not rapping anymore?
Why did I tear up guys?
Chester sang about fighting his demons. What will this one sing about?
Is that an AI video that converted Chester what if, he born woman? First I saw that Linkin Park reunioned, I am practiced for a diassapointment, but It is good, really good. Something new, in the world, that meaning something.
who's also on full repeat mode rn???
How many international fans are here to support them?🤚🏻
meh... doesnt hit that spot, like Chester did. Is there an AI App that can turn this into his voice? That song would be soooo rat.
Is this thrash metal now?
Is that Nick Miller's bar?
So how’s Danny Masterson? Still a lifelong friend of his?
I wonder why they didn't ask Jaime Bennington to be the new vocalist, it would have been great
So what is this band called?
Why this give me Crawling vibes
Isnt she affiliated with scientology?
Who else heard Chester’s scream at 0:45 , damn I miss him , glad to have grown up hearing them and will keep going with this new era
They need money?
Don't know why the new vocalist gives me Guano Apes vibe
How come all the comments are saying “no one could replace Chester”? No crap, Mike and LP have been saying for years that was never the intention everyone is in the comments just repeating what another person said.  This song was super dope, and I am excited to hear more. Quit already comparing this amazing vocalist with Chester, let him rest and honor him.
Is that the bar from new girl?
Enjoying the new song, but is it me, or does emily sound a bit like lzzy Hail when singing this?
Whose there in 2030?!
Why did she have to be a Scientologist? 🤦‍♂️
Who else also almost thought they heard Chester for a second? 😱
So no one mentioning she is a scientologist and rape apologist? Are comments mentioning it getting shadow banned?
Does this mean we can get more linkin park transformers songs???
Does Emily still support convicted rapist Danny Masterton?
How can I like this video 100,000 times? YouTube?
I Loved it........Amazing.....Is this Song a Dream? Linkin Park Forever 😘😘😘😘😘😘😘
Is that the bar from New Girl?
why not create a new band name instead of using linkin park and letting some fans down, let the band stay as it is when chester is still with us.
Is it only me or she really sounds a lot like Oliver Sykes ?
Where's Rob???
Was Mike painting the Wither Storm from Minecraft Story Mode?
I only wonder If Chris Cornel hadn t passed away would Chester still be among us?
Is it just me, or does the new drummer look like Haywire from Prison Break? The Prison Break Machine...
Where were you when they did a comeback?
Is this black ops 6 zombies song 😮
Why the name is the same ?? That is not linkin park anymore…
this is joke?
What about Chester ??
Is that the bar from Crazy Stupid Love?
is this Henry Cavill?
Why's Rob is not part of new Linkin Park?where is he?
Where is Rob?
Did the singer got transitioned into a woman?
Is it just me or LP just made a League of Legends worlds song without knowing lmao
YOU GUYS GOT A SCIENTOLOGIST AND RAP**T SUPPORTER FOR A NEW SINGER?!? SHAME SHAME MIKE
Why did you get a Scientologist grape apologist as lead singer?
What the heck is this? 😖 I was never a big Linkin Park fan but I think this helped me understand the reason I never fully became one.
Is it just me... Or does this music video have a mashup of vibes/aspects from the different MVs of the past before leading up to the vibes of the new era? If that's the case then heck yeah-
This feels like when Wendy’s made vanilla frosty for the first time, like it’s new but the same but it isn’t?
Is it just Me or does she sound like Avril Lavigne
Did they film in the same bar that's used in the show New Girl?
You guys ever thought about to digitize Chesters voice via AI? Never ending comeback for new projects  Just a thought, love you all 😘
Is that Lil Dicky dropping off the package?!
is it just me or is there like an echo of chesters voice mixed in behind it a little like a soft echo 🤌🤌🤘
and why this woman? now they've become like everyone else, ordinary sh..t
Is that the bar from New Girl??
Am I the only one who got teary-eyed when Emily started singing the chorus?
Why Rob didnt come back??😮
Is that the bar in New Girl?
is thin woman the new singer of lp?
Who is the female voice?
New opening for Arcane?
*Would Chester support a radical scientologist who harassed the victims of Danny Masterson’s rapes being in this band?*
Is this only me hearing Chesters voice in my head when Im listening to this?
What happened to rob the dummer
y los twety one pilots?
Who knows this guy
Is this the first LP song with the F*** word in it?
Is she the official new voice? and ho is she?
Is that Nick Miller's bar from New Girl?
Really???….it’s bad so much.
This was uploaded only 15 hours ago?!!!!!!!
Is that chesters voice at .45 seconds?

After all this time? always.
alot easier for bands to mke music with AI now, notice all the 90 s bands coming out with singles this year?? hmmmmmm
How has this only 3m views?
Is it me or it sounds like early days of Paramore? The drums, vocals of course and quite shockingly the distortion tone as well.
Who is here in 2030?  P.S. I will be :)
Is the girl the new singer? Her and evanescence should do a song together as well 😊❤
Really? THIS is your comeback song? Okay 😂
Where is rap part ?
Is it true that Emiliy is a scientologist and a defender of Danny Masterson? If so, no matter how good of a vocalist she is, I could no longer support the band.
Why not the guy from Hybrid Theory? Dang it
Love this song. So what's outside the Emptiness Machine? Hopefully not more emptiness.
I’m sorry is that the bar from New Girl?! 🤣
This is not linkin park anymore… why not come with a new name?
Who will do the screaming?
Is anyone else picking up the similarities in Emily’s voice and Chester’s. There are specific parts in the song where it’s almost uncanny. Love it
Where is rob Bourdon?
What is this? Says Link Park, sounds like something different. Not sure if I like it. Probably not so much.
ok, the question is: WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY with this? The Emptyness Machine is ... BOH?!?! where is the old Linkin Park music vibe? I have no idea! it sounds like, as Korn said in the past "Warner Bros? y'all want a single, say suck that", but in the "ok, yes Warner.. for sure we are going to put out a new record just for the deal". but this makes no sense now!  LP are dead after Chester's death. ain't you?
Thank god!  Some new freaking music!  Is the chick in the band now too??
is it just me or at 3:06, Emily Glitched out into Chester----
how many times have you listened to this?
New Transformers song?? 😅😂
This is great! But the real question is, "How will the classic LP songs sound with her voice?"  The more live shows they do, the more comfortable she'll become.
Only 2M?! Come on!
Anyone else notice chesters scream during mike singing, around  48 seconds in?
can somebody wake up ALEX HEFNER for a reaction video on this?
Are we ignoring the fact that she’s a Scientologist who supports Danny Masterson?
2:13 It's almost like... i can ear him singing this part along with Emily, is it on purpose? If so, that's dope.
0:47 Is this Chester's scream ? Or I am delusional?
Lyrics are not good. “Emptiness machine???!” Wtf are y’all on? This isn’t good. No matter how bad we want it to be. Corporate garbage.
Oh! So this isn't AI recreating Lp?
Why are there no credits to the people who did the music production, mixing, mastering??
Why not audition singers.....???
where is rob?
Is the drummer guy new too?
Why does it last 30 seconds?
00:46 am I the only one who's hearing Chester's legendary voice in the background?
Umm… isn’t that Nick’s bar from New Girl???
-"How many times have you heard it?" -"Yes"
Some kind chester female version???
Why am I crying?
Am I seeing things or was that Chester @3:07? New LP era HYPE!
am i the only one listening with Chester's vocal??
Am I the only one who thinks her voice sounds similar to Renee Phoenix (the lead singer of Fit for Rivals)?
Sooo I think my graphics driver is broken, but why does it still look great?
How many of us are humming this song today? ❤
Arcane season 2 ?
New transformers movie on the way?
Why am I loving this song so much?????
For a second…..I heard Chester…is that weird?
Is Chester’s sound at first?
@linkinpark what happened to Rob, why is he not at the drums??
This sound is really incredible, thank you! I can't wait to discover this new being! When can we expect a concert in France <3?
is she Scientologist ??
Who the gal what's her name???
Is she.... You know.. is she...?
Omg, I got shivers, who's the vacuum lady?
What is this crap?
Who else is in love with Emily's voice ?
Am I the only one who can hear Chester sing?
Anyone watching in 2031?? Still a banger :)
Is the bar the same one from New Girl?
Who from 2007? 😢
Where is rob??
On a side note: isn't that the bar from New Girl? 😅
Who’s here now?
Dude where is ROB? 😮
Is Link Park to back from Origins?
Does she spin into Chester at the end, approx 3:08?
Is she officially the new vocalist?
How long till this one takes the cowards way out too?
can we get an chester ai for this?
Why dont u guys did like meteora was? I think she can fit in that style 👍🏻
😢😂 WOW! But One Question, Whose She! Singing With Mike?.
Where is the touch of dj joe hahn?  It could be better if he added some of electronic melodies on the song
can we just put Chester AI in all the upcoming ones?
The hardest part of a trauma is not the wound but the healing. And we are finally entering a new era.Most of us were teenagers and now we have a story behind us. Can you see the beginning?🫶🥹💗
Does anyone else see her turn into Chester right at the end? 3:07
What is this? A Diversity hire?  :/  broken record, mfer. Btw, Affirmative Action benefited white fems more than all POC combined.
Emily is Chester's daughter?
Welcome Linkin Park 2.0 or is this Linkin Park Reloaded?
Great song. (But where is Rob?).
Where's Bourdy? :(
Hey i got question .... is Brad Delson still on guitar? I did not see him on live, but he is on Music Video.
Why did rob bourdon get out of the band?
New arcane song???
A new era indeed and I'm very grateful for it❤. Just wondering: With Emily as the lead vocalist, how are they gonna perform the old songs?
Where is rob bourdon?
Where did you find this girl?
Who is their new drummer?
Why are there tears in my eyes when I'm smiling so much?!
Who let bro cook? 💀
Any unreleased tracks with Chester going to feature on this album?
How many times did you listen to this song? Me: 'Yes'
Is she part of that Xenu cult or not?
Am I the only one who is crying while listening to this????.....this is pure emotions..... Love you Chester..... Linkin Park is breathing ❤❤❤
Is that the griffin from new girl?  Also……… great song and I’m excited for the return of LP.
At 3min7sec  . Was that chesters face??
is that lil dicky ?
an Scientologist as singer ? not sure bout that one.
Why do I hear Billy Idol - Rebel Yell, in this? lol
IS THAT THE BAR FROM NEW GIRL TV SHOW????
Anybody else getting good charlotte the river vibes?
maybe we can resurrect Nirvana next?:D
this made me cry. why? I don't know, so many mixed feelings. & Extremely happy LP is back
Are those gaussian splattings?
How can you make something that resembles metal at times so whiny? G+d!
Is it Paramore?😂
Is anyone who doubt about new vocalist? I don't know, apparently I need time to get used to it.
Where the heck is Rob Bourdon??
Do you like the new Linkin Park?
now that they've found a new singer it begs the question.. shouldn't they all be replaced? they're pushing 50, linkin park isn't the band members, it's the sound
It's normal to not be able to change of songs from 3 hours ?
Hm, her voice i raspy, which I like. But the vocals are maybe too much soften in the post production?  I think she could do/learn screaming with that voice.
Where is the drummer?
At 0:39  Phoenix: Why did u redeem the gift cards?!
Did Rob left? I'm sure that's not him on the drums.
Shouldn't they be fighting ninjas in a sewer or something?
😅 I still need Evanescence join with Linkin park 🎉 it's possible?
Wooo, is there a female Chester in here? :'-D Great song! I like it straight away.
Where is rob burdon ?
Am I the only one noticing the Brody Dalle/the Distillers resemblance in her voice ? Oh my I love it 😍❤ And you can kind of feel Chester vibing with them throughout the song 🥰🥲 Getting goosebumbs af
is it illegal to replay this song for 12hours on max volume?
Why not Jennifer Weist ? She did it well for the cover from "a place for my head".
Is that the bar from New Girl?
Couldn't they just leave the name linkin park and start under a different name? I can't associate the band with a different singer it doesn't feel right. I know what they doing I just can't personally do it
Am I the only one who gets emotional listening to this?
Am I the only one that can't believe it's been seven years? Feels both, like forever and like it only happened yesterday.
Is this start? it's already fire !!!
I am confused here. Help. Linkin Park has a female led Vocs now?
Why am I crying?
Emily Armstrong's voice kinda reminds me of Lzzy Hale's voice. Is it just me, or has anybody else been thinking the same thing?
Could have come up with the  more better singer....there are many, I wonder why lp has choosen her ???????
is that bar the bar from new girl ?
Isn't she a scientologist that doesnt believe in therapy?
is... is the world healing ?
Is that new because since the lost of Chester I've miss them soooooooooooooooooooo much
Why did Rob not join back?
Is Emily can scream as well?
Is it just me or does it have a bit of a RISE AGAINST sound to it?? AWESOME!!! So happy Linkin Park is back!!
New Transformers are coming soon or what?
Who was here before the 5.000 Views?
Am i the only one who woke up with a WhatsApp message from linkin park? What a beautiful day ❤
Name of the female singer, plz??
where's Rob Bourdon? did he quit the band?
Honestly though am I the only one that can't stop listening to this song!? It's just so fkn right. God y'all really did the damn thing. I haven't liked a track this much since the first time I heard Catalyst.
Is that Chester at 3:07 ?
How many had goosebumps when you listen❤
Why would you pick a rape apologist/scientology cult member as your new singer? lol.
I can hear some of that league of legends vibe in this...   Collin is that you? 😍
And also a new drummer?
What happens here?!😱😨
Why am I getting Goosebumps listening to LP's new song after so long...
Is Emily sitting in the same bar of the series "new girl"? It'd totally make sense.
- How many times have you listened to the new Linkin Park song? - Yes
She's a good singer but they didn't have any other option???
I can feel butterflies in my tummy again, what is happening?
It's coming a new era of linkin park, but I only was a question, where is the old drummer?
Am I crazy or does the new lead singer sound like a female Chester?
Why has the drummer been replaced too?
Why people hatin on emily taking chester's place   The band isnt complete without chester but they sound good with emily
Did i realize they have a new drummer, what happened the original drummer? 😢
Any new transformer movie?
Who is she?
I love her! She’s a fit but where’s rob?
Where Is ROB? Where Is ROB? Where Is ROB?😢😢😢
Who is the woman?
Can we just appreciate how amazing this song is? ❤
Who's the chick? I thought this was going to be a old song they never released and was waiting for Chester to come in.
where's linkin park ?
why am I crying at work?
Why does everything have to be AUTOTUNE? Awful
Is pulsing on my body, what have you guys done linkin park . This song is from another world
Wooo hooo ... Guess What is back guys  ?
Where drummer rob bourdon?
The new beginning! Wish them luck!  am i the only one feeling the Pink vibe?
What can say...hmmm.... Welcome back Linkin Park! We really missed you! Thanks for this awesome new song. I love it.
Doesn't she just sound like a female version of Chester? Or is it just me? :o
where is rob?
Here's a nice thought experiment for everyone bemoaning the "replacement" of Chester.   If this young lady had been in the original lineup and sadly died, then Chester had been brought in to replace her, would you still feel the same? I guarantee you would.  You're externalising an issue you have with change, perhaps address the issue in yourself first.
Has that "scratched DVD pixels" visual effect been in their other videos besides New Divide? I really like being tripped out by it! 😁
Is it only me, imagining Chester instead of that girl singing. You will always be in our heart Chester <3 <3
Is that Robert Llewellyn at the computer with the headset on? (Kryton from Red Dwarf?)
I don't understand why they waited seven years to replace her with Chester Bennington's voice? Chester's voice is something special. Her voice is one of many that could be found right away.
Who's the vocalist? Damn! It's Mike?
Is this wasn't a linking park song, I still would of like it.
im just glad the new song come out.... when concert ????
👌 lov ya. Em I the only one that when I listened carefully the lyrics, I started to cry?
All the secrecy, countdowns, count-ups for this?
Am I the only one who don't like Chester replacement?
Guys when will u come to Chicago?? 😭😭😭
Rob got replaced?
why am I crying ?? ❤️‍🩹
as a dnb and metal fan this song sounds amazing...we are waiting for Europe tour next year...Budapest and / or Wien? 💚
The Danny Masterson supporter?
Who dafuq is this lady 😅
Was it hard to find a male vocalist? Are you trying to compete  with Evanescence now? What a Downfall....
Who tf is that chick
You mean they didn't try out John Podesta as the new vocalist?
What happened to Rob??
Did I miss something? Where is Rob Bourdon?😢
Is she Chester’s niece? 🤔
Why not rename the band, seriously?  I will never hate these guys, never, but this new style is just not for me. Again, no hate, I will just step away.
Why is no one talking about the lyrics?
Are you seeing this Chester? You will always be in our heart, but we have to move on, we need to.
Are they coming back? :(
Does anybody know, why Rob is not part of that?
How you gon' sing the old songs now?
Was anyone else hoping for a more raw voice? Mike already has the smoother vocals covered; having two cleaner voices is a bit of a letdown.
Where is Rob?
why am i crying the second she starts singing the chorus? is emily chester's kin or something?
Am I the only one who started crying  thinking about how chester is smiling down on this ? ❤️
Is this real? 😮
Excuse me, was that delivery man Joel Haver?
Am i only one who heard Chester screams at 0:46 ? 🥶🥶❤️
Nice to see you guys, is there upcoming New Album ?
Is it just me, or does the fact that the new vocalist is a female make the whole transition from Chester easier to deal with? I feel like there immediately is less competition and comparison and instead feels like a completely fresh start. I'm 100% here for it
Why does this sound like Legends Never Die from League of Legends??? They stole the idea from that song lol
Has anyone noticed how she sounds familiar to Chester in some parts?
Is she the vocalist of dead sara?
am I the only one hearing Chester in this part 2:13 ?
IS SHE REALLY A SCIENTOLOGIST?
What is this new LP tribute band?
why they didn't just get the dude that exactly sounds like chester.
With female vocalists like Evanescence, why not recruit male vocalists?
Why do I hate, that I love this?!
is emily armstrong a scientologist?
Am I the only one happy to have more Linkin Park, even if it's a new type?
Where is old rock? :(
Does anyone else see this song as a follow up to their song Numb? Like, from the same perspective, just 20 years later? I am so happy to see LP return!
Where is Rob?
Is Rob Bourdon not with them anymore?
Where’s the AI version of this song with Chester’s voice? She’s going to do well, people can’t live in the past.
Are you ready to move on? (FC.TH)
😮😮😮 New vocalist for linkin park ?
but why a woman? 🙄
Why isn’t this “trending”?? It’s got almost a MILLION views in 4 hours
wtf is this piece of s hit. ?   Disre spect Chester or what? pls say nothing. or i an gry.
Where is ROB?????
where is rob bourdon?
I'm just wondering if Chester's voice was there?
Not even the same type of music though... How is this Linkin Park? The song by itself is honestly pretty good but I have a hard time recognizing this as linkin park.. Maybe it's time for a name change.
where’s rob bourdon?
Anyone know why the drummer didn’t come back? Did he hate money?
Did you all get brain damage?  A female... Really...  RIP Chester, your band mates have created a monster.
What about the old drummer???? What happened with him???? Why he is not with them?
Anybody else hearing welcome to the black parade in the guitar riffs @ 0:58??
Is she a scientologist?? If so, I'm good
What happened to the previous vocalist?
Where are Rob ??
Who's still listening in 2050?
Where is the Rob 🤦‍♂️
Guys , what the heck ? !  ❤  🎉
Is biutiful song
What happen with Rob?
Anyone else hear the melody of Final Masquerade in there?
Mom can we have Linkin Park? No we have Linkin Park at home Linkin Park at home:
Did they use the bar from New Girl to show of their new girl?
I wonder if it was on purpose that the bar set from "New Girl" is in the first music video with Linkin Parks new girl singer
Is this like a DEI hire?
Where are the old Linkin Park fans?
Is that the same bar filmed for New Girl show?
new drummer also?
Did Rob not want to be part of LP anymore?
Can they like, use AI to bring Chester back to life? I miss hearing him 😢. Console me brothers and sisters.
Are we back guys????!?!
Whos that chick? Her vocals are sick 🔥🔥🔥
Absolutely stunning! I can hear Chester in her voice. I'm looking forward to more!  Edit: Is this song inspired by her life story?
Why isn’t Rob involved?
who's the new girl? she kinda cool 😍😍
Who is Emily…. Oh my god- what a voice! I’m obsessed!!!!!!!! This isn’t Chester- but it’s another voice full of soul and beauty! Wow….
We all miss Chester of course.. but can we give the good man the rest he deserves please??. The band had been evolving ever since and this is  a part of it. Our continous support to the band will help them in this evolution.  Those who miss Chester can go now and follow him to his grave.
Y mis twenty one pilots?😢
Where is Rob?
Is it just me, or does this sound a bit punky?
What happen to the drummer
Who is here in September 2024?
Is that the bar from New Girl?
Its Paramore or linkin park? 😂
It's strange though.... I can hear somehow Chester's singing in my head? why?
How many new Transformers movies does this equal?🤖
What happened there at about 3:09?
😢 😢who is she!??? 😢
Who is she?
Do they finally found a sweet, raspy voice? I feel awkward, I guess I have to get used to it. Nice song
RIP Chester...  Song is great but... Where is Rob Bourdon?
Why pick a scientologist who defends rapists to front your band?
Is she the new lead singer? because her voice and passion are 🔥
where is rob bourdon?😢
1:12 is this rob bourdon?
Is that the bar from "New Girl"?
Anyone from the early 2000s?
Has Nik Nocturnal covered this song yet?
Is that debby ryan next to Pheonix at the beggining of the video?
Why I suddenly think of Paramore when they announce the new Vocal?
Can u please keep her in this role give her a chance
Hold on, are they cooking?
Everyone is sentimenting in the comments, meanwhile I’m just like, “is that the bar from the show New Girl?” 😂
Is it just me, or does she sound like a gender bent Chester?
She's awesome and who is she? Still weird not hearing Chester!
Is that the bar from New Girl? 👀
What’s this song about?🤨
I hope Emily has left the child trafficking cult of Scientology!!!  Can anyone confirm???
Is Emily really a scientologist?
Isn’t that the bar that Nick worked at in New Girl????
when we'll we here LP perform the ARCANE series? the song fits the series. or better yet at LOL WORLDS.
Did you hear the screams..? 0:46
What happen with Rob?
What have u guys done? 😢😢😢😅😅
What ever happen to 5 minute songs that gave us a chance to get lost in it? Went by too quick and I don't remember it.
Why am I crying?
Who marked 1:38 as the highlight?
where is Rob Bourdon?
Is it just me, or is she a mix of Joan Jett & Taylor Momson.? And her voice sounds a lil like Joan's too❤️ Totally needed a girl.. Welcome back LP
Why would they pick a scientologist?
where is rob bourdon?
Can I ask a question, is it Chester's dother?
Why am i hearing Chesters voice thru her...
Is this real... Or am I dreaming? I still can't believe it... I love you Linkin Park. I love you Emily ❤️
is She singing in the same octave(s) that Chester sang? She gave the goosebumps to my skin.
Who is she?
It's just weird without chester 😢... am I the only one who feels this way?
Is that the bar from New Girl?
What happened to Rob? where is he?
Is Rob not returning? :O
Why? Just why? Make a new band.
Where's Rob Bourdon? Where's my favourite drummer?
Where is rob ??
can go on to the next song?
more likes than views?? (good to know yal still jamming RIP CHESTER)
Where is rob bourdon?
What happened to the drummer?
What happened to Rob Bourdon??
Anyone else getting Hunting Party and Minutes to Midnight vibe from this??
Who's here in 2027?
Why are there so few views, what the crap?
Who is the new singer?
Wouldn't it be cool if Chester didn't die but just transitioned? (queue transphobia idc) Just hoping ONE other person thinks that would be a cool alternate reality
What happened to Rob?
The Battery Guy Still The Same?
So linkin park is now halestorm 2?
0:46 is Chester scream at the back? 😱❤️  OMG I LOVE HOW THIS SOUNDS, WELCOME EMILY 😍
Where is there original drummer?
so whin is the next album coming out?🫠
Excuse me?   Who’s that on the second verse? This isn’t a feature song?
How to like multiple thousand times at once?
Can someone explain the story with the new girl? Is she part of the band now?
Alright, but WHERE TF IS ROB?
I love Linkin Park, but why not form a new band with a new name? The Linkin Park legacy is insane, they will never be meeting the expectations everyone has when they hear the band name.
Is nobody gonna address that Emily sounds just like Chester, there is a female tone yeah but God this feels like Chester is singing through her voice.
How does this video have 81,000 likes but only 9,000 views??
So…. When is this song going to be in the next Transformers movie? 😂
wtf is this Joan Jett crap?? this is not LP
Can someone plz do an A.I Chester version.
8,894 views, 8.5k comments, and 78k likes. Am I missing something ?
would it be disrespectful to ask someone to use ai to put Chester's voice in it and see how this song would sound? Not to compare...but for the feels
Is that the bar from New Girl?
Maybe another name ?
How much are you willing to bet that somebody is gonna use AI on this song and hear Chester's voice?
Where is Rob Bourdon??😢
Who in the who and the what is the new vocalist? She is phenomenal, Chester's soul is really in her voice!!!!
Whose the chick?
Please forgive me if I missed, but, does Rob replaced?
Who else was there for the livestream?
Is…is that the bar from New Girl at 0:50?
The new vocalist is tight, but this lead single is kind of blah for me. Linkin Parked. I mean, did these 20+ year multi-millionaires REALLY fall for the promise of the emptiness machine? I'm not buying the manufactured angst shtick anymore, especially with Chester gone.
Imagine Chester singing this song?❤
This kind of feels like a cheap knock off of Linkin Park?  There really was no queen without Freddy and there is no Linkin Park without chester. Should of changed their name.
Is that the Bar from "New Girl"? Because there is a new girl in the band? Smart <3 I'm glad LP is back!
What if chester sing this song
Where's Rob? 😢
Whaou who is that lady ?
Was it just me or when they did the flashes of faces...did anyone else notice looked like chester was in there........ but this took time...and was done perfect ...grieving takes time and im sure us fans will appreciate this move... and welcome the next phase of linkin park.
Who is this woman? Sorry but it's not the same anymore
Any reason why Rob isn’t still in the band? I likely missed the announcement
Who here saw it first on the stream? Also hi lovers and haters 😂❤
Who else here appreciates the return to  The Hunting Party sound?
Who is the girl?
Unrelated but is the bar at 0:51 the same bar they used to shoot New Girl?
Am I the only one crying?
Did they say anything about Rob? i was late to the steam :/
No one notice is that rob bourdon?
where's rob?
How long until we have an AI one with Chester singing vocals?
Do they realize how they make us feel ? that pleasure of the new era and the tears while I'm hearing Emily for the first time with a voice that remind me the special man Chester was, everything is incredible in it, congratulations and thanks you so much
Where my Dead Sara heads at?
What is this garbage?
Am I the only one who thinks she kinda looks and sounds like Tank Girl?  The song sounds pretty good, and she's defo got some serious chops. Good for them finally moving on and making a bold move with a female vocalist. Lookin' forward to hearing how she sounds singing the old songs.
So with her are they no longer releasing any other Chester songs weve never heard before? Was looking forward to the 20th of Minutes
Do they have a new drummer? Or is it just me
Is anyone else imagining this in Chester's voice in their head?
Where ia rob😢?
More likes than views? How tf 😂
How this vídeo have 61k likes with only 7k views at the moment?
Is nobody else gonna talk about the fact that Rob decided to step away?
Why am I crying?  Such a dope song!!! I love it!!!
Where's Rob?😭 We gonna miss you Rob!
Who she? I think they should have gone with a new name for the band, maybe? Like, just a new project.
Who's the chick?
I like her a lot actually:) anyone know who she is or what band she was in ?
7k + views....59k likes. What magic is this?
WAIT ARE WE REALLY BACK?!❤❤❤❤
Who's she?
Is that the bar from new girl?
LP IS BACK?
Why a new Singer if Mike can Sing?!
Where is Rob Bourdon? I understand he retired from the band but damn, we haven't seen this guy in a while. I'm just curious if he still has long hair, a beard and what he looks like now. He is missing from the team. He's a really good drummer
Why did I see hate??? It's hard to be like Chester. She is amazing. Likin Park will always be an amazing band 🤘
Am I the only one missing Rob Bourdon on the drums??? It's weird not seeing him as well
What in the Fort Minor is this trash
Did they get a new drummer as well?
who is she 🤔🤔
Can they just rebrand?
Did you notice at 3:07?
I wonder how long it'll be for someone to do an AI Chester version of this song
Anybody know what this song is called? I'm listening to hard
2:12 - 2:35 was this chester? AI version or a old recorded song like they did with xxx? am i going crazy?
Picking a woman? The old songs live will sound wrong
All replies to all comments are not showing. Evem if you click newest. Why is youtube bl0cking replies? Perhaps to shut down discussion?
I know everybody is missing Chester for sure but where my boy Rob at?
What happened to Rob Bourdon?????
What happened to Rob?
Who is the girl?
Where is Rob Bourdon? 😢
what is this Pretty Reckless wannabe...
Where's Rob? This is not LP.
Does she sound great live like real audio?
Without the numetalness what's Hann purpose in the band?
Am I the only one who thinks you're trying too hard to be Chester? I can't feel this feeling when I listen to it.
This gives me GUANO APES vibes.. Anyone!?!?
Where's Rob???
Why not the vocalist of Hybrid Theory?? 🤷
After all this time? Always ❤
what the hell is this
Aright now who's going to make a AI cover of this song with Chester's voice?
What happen to rob
Why do i remember this song from somewhere? It might have been just a snippet but i remember it from somewhere and i dont know if im just telling it to myself or it really happened. But it sounds so familiar.
So what happened to Emily's other band dead sara?.
Wtf happened to Rob Bourdon?!!
What's her name?
What happened to Rob?
Where is Rob?
Is it just me or is there a very brief slip in of Chester's image around 3:08, just a glitch worth?  My heart is full right now, I'm so happy for LP to be back and making music.
Is it me, or has Mike shinoda found the female version of Chester Bennington
why "wastelands" in outro?
Wtf why this sht looks like running in my head from opening of Code Geass Roze of yhe recapture????
is it me or does she sound like gwen stefanie... anyways im so happy  LINKIN PARK is BACK!
Where is Rob?!?!?!?!?!?!
So Is there new Transformers movie coming out?
I have a question: where is Rob?
Here before 5k views. How long until a million?
Why not call the band something else? lol
Is there a legitmate reason to not just change the band name after the front man passes? It seems like brand recognition is the only reason you wouldn't
Wow..   she is good.  What day is it?  Is it 2003?
White is Rob?
Does anyone know why Rob didn't stay in the band?
Is that Nick's bar from new girl?
I'm curious but is Emily still the lead for Dead Sara also?
Linkin Park were Alive? Good Song tho
But how the f am i supposed to sleep now? HELP
Are Brad and Rob alive?
Why people comparing her with chester ? Stop comparing her with chester !!  She is not replacement , she is just new memebr ( new vocalist) with new era of linkin park , LP wiLL  start again FROM ZERO  Good luck for her .
just me or is the painting homage to Chester.. screams of the past "hoping for what i won't receive" ? could be reading into it too much
Hey hold on just a sec, did they replace Rob Bourdon from the drums side..?? The drummer is new to me if I’m not mistaken
what about the olds songs? whats is going to happen in concerts?
wtf??? I didn’t know they had a new drummer also.
Is rob in the band or no!? Im really happy LP is bringing it back to a more natural instrumental approach. I really hope there are some HEAVY tracks. We really need a few of those. Im LOVING this melody! I admit though, its a tad tough in a way because that chorus just SCREAMS chester. I could legit hear him. My only gripe overall, The KEY changes on the old songs live really altered the tone of some of the songs.
Who will be until the end?
What’s the name of this band?
Whos the chick?
Who else watching this legendary band as the views rise?
Why Rob is not coming back?
