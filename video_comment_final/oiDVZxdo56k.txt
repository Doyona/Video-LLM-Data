As long as you get at least 1 car from each team 14 is plenty Personally a race should be 5-6 laps For Formula E maybe randomise it so its between every other race and every 3 races? Keeps it fresh and makes it a surprise a bit like the airport arrivals.
When can we see the film in the streamings ?
Aren't those cars too big for HO scale?
