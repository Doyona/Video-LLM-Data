Are snake bite kits work in USA with Rattlesnake
What brand and model is the gimble that the Action 5 camera is mounted on?
So where’s Part2?? 🤪🤦‍♂️🤷
How come you didn't give the cameraman a beer?
Where is that Highway
You went to Carnarvon Gorge and didn't go in, was it because you couldn't drive up to everything and get out to take a photo?
Whens the 2nd half of this airing?
@4WD247 Would love to see the literary of the trip ??
So Graham how much smaller is the Y62 compared to the "big" American trucks?
Graham could you please do a cost breakdown on those trips?  Like fuel, camping and such! Im planing a 60 day trip bringing my own ride, renting a truck for the trip so would love a cost breakdown  :)
The cameraman’s nearly redundant?  Make an episode from their point of view.  How they get up the tracks before you hit them, what gear they use while they use them and who drives the camera rig.  They’ve brought us the footage for years.🇦🇺👍
so as an American, I'm curious: if you call a camper, a van, then what do you call a van?
Are you guys looking for a couple to tour with you!? We are ready to leave the house lol
