Did anyone know that kazuto did a porn video 😢 and I just rendomly watched it 😅
including this was there an after party?   did they watch all series  on here while at reunion  ? or only sections  of the series   was this party  after the first meet  with judges tae is like a big brother , hes  sweet -     im gladif he does not have a romance  he has friends  from group
Kazuto is somehow even hotter than when he’s in the show. How did he do that? 🫠

Btw guys,  Anyone knows who wrote to Gensei on the first day.  There were only six people (D,T,R,G,S,K) on the first day and there were six letters (Dai 3, Gensei 1, Shun 1, Kazuto 1). Shun said he didn't write to anyone, right?  Then how was there 6 letters, it should be only 5 letters, right?  Otherwise someone had to write two letters to two persons 😂

i'm confident i've watched this for like a thousand times already. can we ask for the whole video of this please? 🥺🥺
I don't know how to speak English so well, Netflix Japan, could you put subtitles in Portuguese?😢
how come they didn't add episode 1?  when they where at the club and they were playing rock, paper and scissors. when Dai handed his phone with Shun's name on it I was squealing.
Please is there a full video of the reunion?
Will netflix release the rest of the episode reactions?
Will netflix release the rest of the episode reactions?

Can we get the full video pls😭😭😭
Where can we watch the full episode of this?
So they watched just three ep??
I love watching Dai! Pls let them watch all the episodes together 🙏 Alan and Kazuto are both glowing… are they together? Also, DaiShun pls let them be happy together❤
Now that l think: Taehoon, Ryota, Gensei, Alan.. they like Shun a lot, Alan even called him sweetheart. Then of course, there is Dai, who has fallen in love with him. This mk me questions the editing. In korea we hv M/B-C tht famous with their evil editing to create some drama. Drama attracts viewers you know? n l feel like Shun had been viewed unfairly by the editing. Can Netflix please release more positive clips of Shun? Cuz..  If he is half as "toxic" as it is portrayed, why do we see the boys loving him? showing him attentions, joking with him n even... having crush on him? Shun's besties are literally the ones with purest hearts, Gensei n Ryota. Don't y'all think these two won't compatible with him if he's tht hard to hang out with? Taehoon the most mature one, also chose Shun to work with him for the last time, eventhou he has no crush on Shun. Shun get so many hates in his IG tht it makes me ache for him. Ppl called him red flag. Do they know what red flag actually means?! He is never using his traumas as excuse to act the way he is, he explained WHY is he the way himself TO DAI: rmb,there were only two of them. We saw how the others share their family problems openly in the green room. Shun is an introvert who used to stand for himself, because he has nobody who would protect him if things go wrong! yet he knew n he still humbly called himself as troublesome. He is aware of his antics. But he can't afford to get hurt again, as his soul full of scars already... And ppl scold him heartlessly to go to psychiatrist instead of dating show? it's like calling ppl with cancer to stay at the hospital instead of attending a party because some @ssh*les can't bear their "troublesome" existence 🙃
So who wrote the note to Gensei?
So any couple still dating after the show got over???? Can anyone tell me if you guys know anything.... I'm curious.....
How did no one snatch up Taeheon  he's so cute
When will the next episodes reaction video comes out 😭😭 i cant wait fr
He asked, "What do you think is the best thing about this summer?"  He looked at him: "The sea breeze, coffee, and you."❤
