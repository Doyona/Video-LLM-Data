they both eat CD?
3:41 Why doesn't anyone talk about Wonhee? Her voice is beautiful. 🥹🥹🥹🥹
Where are the haters nowww???
0:22, why is there a blur on her shoulder here lol?
Will 'Cherish My Love' ever be sung? 🥹
Isn’t Wonhee is a promising singer for her young age 🥰 But will Hybe provide proper training to help her develop her voice further? I know that for now ILLIT doesn’t have songs that really require great vocals but Wonhee’s talent could be a great tool to use more in the future
why they all look same tho 🤔🧐
Are they Japanese or Korean group?
Does wonhee have a throat infection or anything? Sound like she is not in the best condition
why are they dressed up like a toddler
