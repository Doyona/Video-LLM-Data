I propose i guess the question. If we would have won. Do you think that if they had won the cup, would this not be considered the greatest hockey team ever? Beating out the current obe, the 84''-85" Oilers?
what do they average shots on target?
Did panther lose this one on purpose to so it can be a game 7 at home? This is Florida they are probably pushing for a game 9 at home lol
Hey sportsnet. Anyway to watch your channel in the states? We can’t stand the games on ESPN. It’s ruined this amazing series.
Don't know the history - but has there ever been a game 7 of the SCF that went to OT?  If Florida can get its act somewhat together, I could see that happening.
What are hell is going on?
Is it me or does no one like Florida lol??  I don’t either, but damn it’s crazy everyone rooting for Canada 🇨🇦!! 💕
Florida lost game 6 to win it at home. Right, Florida fans? 😂
What would hurt more? Florida blowing a 3-0 series lead or Edmonton losing game 7 after coming all the way back in this series.
Are we witnessing the biggest choke job in NHL history?
If Skinner shuts out Florida in game 7 does he get the con smythe?
Big cats get their nails removed?
Pulling your goalie at 4:1 against you. What could go wrong?
Anyone else notice a couple WEAK penalties called? I think one was a first penalty called on an Edmonton player for phantom slashing and one later in the third on a Florida player for a hook, I think? Those 2 crummy calls balanced out but the refs were definitely not consistently sharp.
3 minutes pulling a goaly?
Let's not forget all those Panther fans .....helllo? Where did they all go😅
Is this sped up? Anyone else notice?
Wtf happend to Florida? Is it intentional giveup? Win 3 in a row and flush that gap right away into the toilet.
Could this be rigged? I feel like after game 3, somebody told the Florida team "OK guys, now take it easy as we really need the series to go on for 7 games, not just 4."
Anybody know the heimlich maneuver? Adios chokethers.
How are you Stars fans feeling?
Are they going back to Florida or staying in Edmonton?
What if McDavid shows up on Monday?
I don't understand Florida's logic, Edmonton scores an empty net, yet Florida didn't put the goalie back in, are they asleep at the wheel?
How about that disallowed goal 🥅 @Floridapanthers?
I'm from Russia. I'm rooting for cats. Maybe someone can tell me what's going on??????
Are we about to witness the biggest choke/comeback in NHL history?! 😂
What are The Panthers doing? Looks like they wanna lose two final in a row. They had The Oilers right where they wanted them. 🤦‍♂️
History and choke or Clutch and cup drought for Canada?
Are the Oilers going to get to Florida for #7 before Bettman has the border shut down? Legitimately concerned.
Does anyone know where i can stream these finals? I used to be able to find one on Twitter but not anymore.
What happened to the brick wall in the Panthers net?  🤔       😂
But Florida lost so that they could win the Cup at home right?
McDavid needs to step up? 😂 Game 7 here we come
Can we get neutral announcers? Every single time I know who wins by the announcer you all show in the highlights. If they are praising the one team the whole time it makes it obvious. Do better.
Reverse Sweep? I could use a good laugh
Did Florida secretly touch the Prince of Wales trophy? Looks like their energy disappeared
Where are all the cocky panthers fans that were absolutely dogging on the oilers in highlights comments? Y’all have been really quiet recently
After 31 years, is the cup FINALLY coming back to Canada?
where was the panthers goalie in the last two?
So the Panthers’ families had to travel across the continent twice to watch this?
Yo @canucksnate where are you bro? What happened to 3-0
Ok, which of you oiler fans sold their soul to the devil?
5:16 slash 1, 2, 3…no calls?  🤨
Wtf is this quality sportsnet?
Am I still a bandwagon after Edmontons first win? Let's go real ice hockey what
How’s that not a rigged series?
2023-2024 Florida Panthers = 2016 Atlanta Falcons?
