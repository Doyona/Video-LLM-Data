Sad this drama had  such a beautiful start and topic but now it's just dragging , just like some of other Hum dramas .please finish it !
Andaleeb can’t forgive him for one mistake and the countless mistakes she made starting from day 1 of their marriage go unnoticed??? She is such a toxic character
How could andaleeb not go and meet her daughter as soon as she returned
What is happening? Wasn’t this drama addressing domestic violence. But now it is an Indian soapbox without any sense. Andaleeb forgot all those stupidity that numair had to put up with her. Not once she went to see her daughter. Waoo what a stand

I don't know what the writer is trying to convey to us ??
How come no one is holding Andalib accountable for faking her death???? That's not only illegal but immoral and psychotic! This drama turned into absolute nonsense!
