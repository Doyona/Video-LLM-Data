Why did it end so fucking soon! I was busy!
What happened to Murdocs necklace I thought it was a upside down cross
Whats the Song name that played when the Box Open?

Why tf i just get the notification, i thought im gonna be the first
Do brainrot little children even know who Gorillaz are?
Anyone else bummed that it's Plastics Beach era and not modern Gorillaz.? Don't get me wrong, plastic beach was amazing but lol use the modern Gorillaz at least.
Are this the guys from fornite?
I wonder when their next music video is gonna be
Bro where’s Murdocs upside down cross!?!
Hmmmmmmmm, yeah this is cool and all but, who?
What the fuck are Gorillaz?
Are they that desperate for money/relevance?
What does this even mean ? A video game collab withh uh gorillaz??!!   I got the best video game idea to date ask me let’s make it happen ! Not San Andreas but San Kabukicho globally mobs Mofia yakuza have to work together to make their investment work the right way to Save the world.  It’s a business and the real ones don’t kill their clients it’s a business! What do u think? Logistics in the works same with finance possibly I’m making an imaginary thing into reality . 😅😂❤❤❤💐💐💐💐🙂🙂🙂 congrats on the collab! 🎊 🎉
How is this game still alive?
How did they all fit in that trunk at the same time?
…what are you trying to imply with this?
Why did they use FN cell shading? Their recent MVs are closer to FN’s usual normal style anyways.
how long will this promotion last?
Is it a concert
Ok, but where is that Ace skin??? 🤔
Remember when Gorillaz where not commercial sellouts?
my question is: is this canon?
At this point, what isn't in fortnite??
Why couldn’t it all be in the music pass😢
¿Does murdoc control this channel?
What actually happened?Because I want to know if this is connected to the lore or not.Cause how long are they going to stay there?Is this a continuation of their last album?Are we getting more albums from them in the near future?Cause I wanna know
people still play fortnite? thats news to me
Wait- ITS REAL???? I thought it was just a joke people were all in on 😭😭💀
Murdoc is right handed, why is he holding the base like that?
Your kidding right right?😂
What song is it at the end?
The old designs ?
The real question is 'why are everyone else in their phase 3 outfits, except 2D he's in his phase 2 outfit' ???
Why is it Phase 3 Noodle, though ?
How did Fortnite adapt the models to 3d than the band
Is this for real?
*Do kids even know who Gorillaz are???*
Fortnite the equivalent to selling ur soul?
Since when did mudocs necklace change from an inverted cross.. trying to be woke?
Can you guys make your own cartoon show it would go crazy
Can you guys make a new great song for the last one
Why....?   I really hate the direction Gorillaz has gone since 2017.
why is this so funny to me? i don't get it lol.
Are they gonna add Noodles dance from Dare? Dang that's a lot of likes
I wonder how they convicted David Albarn into this one  into this one
Fortnite has all famous persons collabing with him lol, now fortnite x O2 when?
a cracked dome??? hmmmmm
Yo where's feel good inc? How could that not be a part of this update
Has the new album released yet
0:09 whait a sec... a futbol stadium?
Is the boogeyman gonna be here?(the villan in rhinestone eyes)
no inverted cross necklace and murdoc is tall???? i’m confused
Imagin if cod collaborated with Gorillaz?
What ever happened to the whole reject false idols thing....
WAIT WHAT THIS IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING?!
What where's 2ds hat
What time the concert is?
Okay but they can’t add Mj or Benson Boone??? Or even NF???
Wait aren't this the people that made Rhinstone eyes? Because that song is peak
Yall rather do this then just make a series? What is this pathetic attempt at trying to reach the next gen😂
Everyone seems to be dressed as different phases, isn't it?
how did they get stuck in the box tho?
think that first guy is going to be ok?
Are they going to have a concert style event like with Travis and mellow ?
Why they leave half of the members out of the pass, then add them and their best songs to the shop? They should be in the music pass. Epic scoundrels. 😂
Fortnite: Who's Next? C'mon, tell me. XD
Is this in canon? 🤔
Is this the beginning of phase 8?
Everyone is from the plastic beach album but 2D is from the now now?
What in the hell
Can yall gift me the "2D" skin for free?
What is GOING ON 😭
Who droppin on cracker island?
Noooo Murdoc necklace what happened??
why though lol
I’m not mad, I’m just confused..? Though if this means gorillaz gets enough money now to go back to doing things like plastic beach then it’s worth it
So uh, what exactly is this game again now?
how did this even happen like how did they come up with this
how do I put this for boomers who don't play?... Guitar hero? Rock band? It's just a side game within fortnite with its own battle pass and rewards.
Who’s next crash?
do they even get money from this?
Wait... Noodle is a kid and there are guns in Fortnite, right?
can we do drivebys with the Geep???? 🤔
In Gorillaz lore, did they go to the Fortnite world? Or in Gorillaz lore, did they agree to a collab with the Epic Games company?
I don't know if i should be scared or happy that this is happening lol; I feel like Fortnite kinda is.. eh.. yikes?
Could anynody possibly gift me the 2d skin? My user is TATOR TOT 007
Murdoc's left-handed?
have you considered retiring?
Are we serious? Is this a way to platform the genocide in gaza? Is this your way to stand against the American empire? Damon, my namesake of my leftist teach. Wake up and smell the bomb fragments.
How do we reach these kiddsssss
Nobody talking about how each of them reps a different phase?
Why isn’t the skins in the locker under the icon series???????????????
Is it possible without politics?! This really annoys me. Why do we always have to get involved in politics?
Is this the first time I'm playing that garbage?... Nah. But it's great for those who are Gorillaz fans and are 10 years old (Fortnite fans).
Noodle is a mix of phase 2 and 3?
Do gorillaz fans approve this or nah?
Does this mean tank girl in Fortnite?
How long until we get a Kpop Demon Hunters collab
Running low on money, eh?
Lego Gorillaz when?
Is this what makes me try Fortnite?
If this person is named 2D, why isn't he in 2d, graffiti, or stickers?
Am i the only one who hates this collab?
Who's next? Slipknot?
Why always collabs with Fortnite??
What the fuck?
So what's in the pass thoigh?
btw why did russel trip??? THIS IS ELDER ABUSE 💔
Better question why not a fortnite event? Would be dope to be fighting zombies in the Clint Eastwood music video and messing around in white void of the rock the house music video
Can Gorillaz do a feat with Massive Attack ? I know Damon Albarn did, but the two groups would work well together, espically their trip-hop style
Wait....it was actually real?!?!
im crying WHY???
Is it just me or does anyone one notice Murdocks necklace not the anti cross but it is a skull with a sword in it
What the fuck…
WE GOT GORILLAZ IN FORTNITE BEFORE GTA 6?
HOW THE HELL DID RUSSEL FIT IN THE BOX?!
what in the world
IS THIS REAL, PLEASE TELL ME IT IS.
wow early much?
Who do these guys think they are, gorillaz?
kids with guns ???
