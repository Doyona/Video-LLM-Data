Why these people ask all this pawan deep and arunitha ..and all this questions...these are children ...this is very bad ...and asking them what u vil do vith the money ...they r young and there parents vil do whats right...nonsense interviewers
Why ask such silly question to these young boys  about Arunita Pavandeep ! Channel people created this jodi for their TRP ....so don't involve children in all this !
The entire essence of the moment is squashed with such questions on money. It is not possible to avoid these ?
We will decide merit after sufficiently hearing Atharv. Why nobody is projecting Atharv, why his performances are not been highlighted? Is he par below and has godfather/s to become top?
How will these kids handle their kids ..
How the second boy become winner?
Avirbhav is so innocent and soo adorable. Congratulations Avi and Atharva for winning. In that age giving fight to double the age kids is not easy task. Atharva and Devi also deserve contestants.  But one question though, if Atharva gets popular votes and becomes winner, would they decide Avi as second winner?
