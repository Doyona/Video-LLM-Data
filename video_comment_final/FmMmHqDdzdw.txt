Can highlights stop being shown on a tilted screen? Who thought that was a good idea?
How does the 49ers lose every game in October 3 straight games and all of a sudden they are the best team in the NFL?
How is Brock Purdy ahead of CMC in the MVP race? It makes no sense. It’s literally ridiculous
does anyone really think cowboys have a chance to be in the playoff these team beaten easy teams these year next week we gonna see if cowboys even worth talking about ..
Why is no one talking about the first quarter which was dominated by the Eagles, then boom, complete opposite….
What about the 2 different coordinators? That’s a huge part of how a team operates.
Why does everyone compare last year defense to this year’s. The Eagles had a better defense last year and they were top in defense this is a whole different defense with new players and coaches.  So you can’t compare the two. 49ers came in and lost to that top defense last year.
How can Purdy be an MVP when he is not the best player or the MVP on his own Team????? CMac and Deebo are 1 and 2 , Trent is 3 then him 4 but he is an MVP front runner HOW???
Why can't McCaffrey be MVP?
Are we removing Tyreek from the MVP discussion? Imo if he can get 2000 yards this season, he deserves to win
How do y’all praise Brock for “dinking and dunking” when y’all ripped dak and he was throwing it way further than Brock. Like shay said “Debo is taking 5 yards and hitting his head on the goal post”
If that loss delegitimizes the NFC Championship win, does our win against the Chiefs, in KC, delegitimize their Superbowl win? Does that make us Superbowl champs now?
How much credibility can a mediocre qb  like orlovski have?
Didn’t the Eagles play 1 Monday & 2 Sundays? How is that “no rest” compared to any other team that plays Sunday & Mondays?
smh why do they keep talking last year? last year the Eagles had a top D line and secondary. they could hurt you with both. it's not the same this year. all those qbs got knocked out by the Eagles. they are still legit 2022-2023 NFC champs
Can we stop making excuses for the Eagles on why they lost? Oh they were tired if the roles have been reversed then the media would’ve had a field day, saying how the Niners weren’t ready for the eagles
How about all the holding calls that were not called especially on three 49ers scoring plays and one when AJ Brown was held in the end zone. 49ers were clearly favorited by the referees
MVP?  It's not going to be Prescott or Purdy, it's going to be CMC.
What about tyreek hill for mvp? Hes having a better season then any qb right now why are we always trying to give it to the qb even when they dont deserve it
Dan had to play years to be considered elite? Dan was never elite. Not even for one game
Who are offensive coordinators from the Shanahan tree?
The real question is, is Mr. Smith going to root for Dallas this Sunday? It gives the Niners the edge 😅
Why isn’t CMAC an MVP candidate?
Was this Purdy first come from behind win?
Jalen hurts fell off the MVP race because he lost against the Niners? Lmao. So if he beats Dak (again) what’s the deal then? This shits comedy
What happened to form tackles
How is the qb automatically the mvp candidate when the rb/wr hybrid is the key to the offense? How was Purdy w/o Deebo? All positions should be considered for the MVP award.
What would Jalen Hurts be like if he didn't have AJ Brown? Hurts hasn't be elite with him must less without him.
Why is Molly talking?
Hasn’t Purdy played from behind before ?
Why is there no love towards the Lions when talk about the Big Three from the NFC (PHI/SF/DAL)?  They're doing damage.  It's totally disrespectful and I'm in the SF area saying this.
Why does molly always interrupt every 5 seconds my goodness just annoying
Stephen, don't you live on the East Coast or at least, in the East??   If so, why are you all a flutter over the Forty Whiners?!
Can we talk about this not even the same eagles defense from last year?
Wait, so one bad game and Jalen is no longer in the MVP conversation? After beating the Dolphins, Cowboys, Chiefs, Bills, consecutively? Purdy lost 3 straight games, but I guess that doesn’t matter…
my question to the eagles is what happened? the defense started well
how is nobody talking about CMC being a contender for the MVP
We gonna forget that Brock Purdy had a concussion when he played bad?
No Christian McCaffrey for MVP?
Didnt the Chiefs beat the niners in the superbowl? What was the excuse than?
Can we stop blaming our defense for losing 3 in a row? If y’all even look at the stats you’d see how good our defense was.
Tyreek?? How about Lamar goofy
so when does purdy become elite? how many big games must he win? how many great performances must he put up for you to believe he’s great?
Where were the arguments this year since the Niners play FOUR TEAMS off the bye week. Lots of excuses for the eagles right now.
How did they miss a tackle on Purdy, that was the game in a microcosm.
Don’t the Eagles need a new GM, a new coach, a new OC and DC? The Eagles need to do this to be able to undergo the rebuild needed to compete at a championship level
Why is it private?
Joke:  How good the Niners be if they had an "Elite" QB?  LMFAO.
Mahomes played 15 games and was called elite so why not Purdy?
Now pay attention. Has anybody looked at the Super Bowl logo color yet? It is the color of san francisco and the color of baltimore Raven. Every year They have 2 colors in their Super Bowl logo, and so far It has been 99.9% accurate on who going to the superbowl. Makes me wonder if it's fixed or if someone knows the future.😮
Patrick Mahomes was considered elite after two seasons. So why can’t Purdy? Cause he is white?
How do you watch that game and have Brock as the MVP? Deebo and Trent Williams were the best players on the field lol
The difference btw my eagles and 49ers is jalen can play without his good player we won without our te vs bills plus lane johonson didn’t play either but the question is can prudy do good without debo ? I accept the lost we gottta be better no excuses #playoff #mode
If Hurts ends the year with the best record in the league playing with a defense that's played terrible, how is he not MVP? I get it, the Niners smacked the Eagles, but don't rob this man Hurts again.
Why is Shannon and Steven so critical of Purdy?
Did Brock not start at a Deficit last night?  Minus yards at the end of the 1st Q.
What if Dak Prescott get into a deficit what's the difference Purdy has a better team around him purdy is not better than dak in my opinion. Debo and McCaffrey away from him he would just be average
Purdy and Dak mvp and Lamar isn't in the convo? FOH we'll see them on Christmas
How is Purdy the Favorite after  losing 3 straight without deebo if anything CMC or Deep is MVP
How should the NFL handle teams who have a water boy or a security guard pick a fight with a player from the opposing team so they both get ejected?
Recency bias Dak MVP ahead of Hurts because Eagles lost? 49ers and Eagles beat Cowboys too
Where were the Refs to bail these Egirls out again?
Why can’t a defensive player win MVP?
How can Purdy all of sudden be MVP when you said that he’s no one without the talent around him Shannon?
So, the 49ers can't complain about playing without a quarterback, but the Eagles can complain about having to play a team on 10 days rest? 😂
Molly decided to be annoying again?
Dak Prescott isn't in the MVP race because Purdy dominated Prescott, head-to-head They have the same stats, btu Purdy did it against better competition. The Cowboys have played among the easiest schedules in the NFL. The schedule now gets tougher for Dak.  Can he still put up big numbers?  Can he lead the Cowboys to a division title?  Show me against the Eagles, next week.
Why they acting like the eagles is the same team last year, if this was the same team, the 49ers would had lost again,
Poor Eagles Fans 😂😂😂FOCUS ON DALLAS THIS WEEK!!! or are you too fatigued from the competition yall been playing?? 😂😂👋🏾
