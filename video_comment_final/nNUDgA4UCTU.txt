Why wildcard introduction was and commenting about house mates was not telecasted in the main episode or plus? 🤦🏻😡‼️‼️‼️  Giving so much build up on promo and when episode comes janmoni crying or nora crying . 🤦🏻🙆🏻  Still very bad editing and not showing important things very boring episode and feels like channel or editor of the show is favoring some people deciding what to telecast and what not to telecast, everone is not watching the 24/7 live.  🤷🏻‍♂️  This important introduction and commenting part of wildcard contestants was only in promo not in episode or plus and first week itself nominations for them based on what we people should judge them ?  Poor and terrible editing 🤦🏻
Why is everyone against abhishek s? He seems to be perfect bboss material
