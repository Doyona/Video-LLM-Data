Where is sun and moon
I was at least expecting Freddy to be able to beat him. What is the moral of this story even?
Hey man, do you miss that one from FNAF 2 too?
THIS IS A FNAF SONG? WHAT?
Okay here me out… please reanimate basics in behavior with PGHfilms or maybe do it yourself search a few tutorials seeing how good this animation is… can you reanimate basics in behavior?
This always makes me wonder why they never replaced Bonnie. If the books are right about there being multiple Pizzaplexes, was Bonnie’s murder exclusive to that one Pizzaplex or did every Monty decide to kill every Bonnie? Was he threatening them and that’s why they didn’t replace Bonnie? Was Fazbear Entertainment just that lazy?
How was the epic
What could possibly be happening
How come I never commented whenever it first came out? To be honest even if this song didn't come out and I heard it somewhere else, I'd instantly say it's a Tombstone song.
Why did the ending remind me of king k rool
Am I the only one that doesn't think Monty killed Bonnie?
Could we get an instrumental version of this?
How many times have I reheard this song
0:44 was that bonnie doing Demo's Scottsman's Stagger?
was that a Giga Monty reference at the end?
Why did I ignore this when it came out? This is very cool!
Was that a giga monty reference?
Is nobody gonna talk about the mimic in the background
Why does i think of legosi for some reason
Why is it so quiet? Like even on my max volume it's whispers
Is it weird why I wonder why they made Monty if he wasn’t one of the actual superstars
I wonder how he actually became famous if that was a dream?
The secret of the mimic song when?
At the end we see monty walking off but what if he's walking off to do same sins he saw in his imagination?
I love all the little dances and easter eggs Monty does at 2:06 lol  - Gmod dance - Gangnam style - the macarana - YMCA - The Default Vrchat dance 😂 - it's getting better the more I'm looking lmao Wait is that the mimic behind the green screen??
I wonder what would happen if montey was saw by freddy and Roxy and chica before they weren’t ever friends?
WHY DO YOU JUST DROP OUT OF NO WHERE AND WHY IS IT ALWAYS GOOD
Did any one else see the 67 in the background keep watching till you see it
in the window at 1:03 it looks like the mimicc?!?!?!?!?!?!?
How do you get his glasses? before killing Roxy. 1:19
is this Montys past life before he killed glamrock bonnie
Why does his voice sound like monty’s voice way more than the actual monty voice?
This is cool, but is it lore accurate?
What if Gregory was in the suit 1:49
HOW BIG WAS THE BUDGEEET no, HOW MUCH SKILL CAN YOU HAVE, like daaam great song great animation, GREAT everything
Can anyone tell me what type of magic is happening in that bridge that starts in 1:16

Is gator cooking Freddy?
Did anyone catch Monty doing the gangnam style?

Could we get a textless version? I really wanna do the edit but the words are super distracting from the song I’m using—   Amazing animation!! Super well done and the song is superb!!!
Was that a giga Monty reference at the end?
Why Roxy instead of Foxy?
who remembers when there was no most replayed in this video?
What do they feed these Fnaf animators? and also TLT making a song of one of my favorite character? I love this song.
Can I get permission to make a hour loop video of this?
THE ANIMATIO?!?!??!?!M HEEELLOOOOOOO??????????????
2:07 why is there so many clones of Monty’s!?!?
Hey Evan, it’s me Cassidy I heard you said a bad word but I didn’t want to get you in trouble so I said what did you say?
Why is there so many Maltese
But what if Gregory didn't exist and Monty destroyed them all himself and subsequently fell down, losing his legs?
2:07 was this a Giga Monty Reference? :o
What If the end was Gregory committing several acts of robotic murder on Monty
Why can't we go back in time?
Might be the fnaf song of the summer?
what is ts
Does Anyone else want songs for the other animatronics in security breach now?
Why is nobody talking about how this is our first TLT song in like,YEARS?!
why is the fnaf community just cracked
WHY DOES NOBODU GET THE ASTRAL SPIFF/SPEEDRUN INFINITE MONTY GLITCH + CHALLENGE OMFG
WHY WAS MONTY DOING THE TENNA DANCE AND ALSO FILMING A TICKTOCK
Such a fun idea for a song! Who comes up with these?

What would be awesome if we get a song for every animatronic from security breach
Wtf were the autistims doing whilst drunking this song??/🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹💀💀❌❌❌❌❌❌
Did anybody noticed Monty doing the macarena?😭
Why am I just realizing I haven’t been subbed to y’all I  been listening y’all since fnaf 1 song way back when every project y’all do I listened to
Is that my second animatronic husband on the thumbnail?  Edit: I wish Monty would step on me.
What theory is this whole music based off of??
1:03 Isn't that the mimic in the background?
1:43 why didn’t Freddy square up? He dodged but then let himself get cooked
Why does this sound a little like daisys
I noticed one small issue about the animation Monty has the claw upgrade before killing Bonnie??? 0:47
2:07 is that a Giga Monty I see?
Is it just me or has anyone noticed only foxy got replaced with a wolf and bonnie chica and freddy still in fnaf not replaced
How many times have you watched this?  Me: yes
I should ask question. Does this song needs fan animation and remixes? My answer- DEFINITELY NOT! ITS FIRE DAMMIT!
why is the music so quiet 💔
why is this actually good lmao
Why is this animation better than the actual game
1:07 - Monty gets his wrist cuffs from bonnie  1:34 - ditches the pants for patterning on legs like Chica   1:40 - Gets star glasses from Roxy  I dunno what he gets from freddy? If anything? Paint on him i guess??
Why does the song kinda sound like daisy's. The hazbin hotel fan song
Which song is better? This Comes From Inside or Step On Up? Reply to me to choose ur side, TCFI: SOU:
How many likes do you need to make a song about the great Bill Cipher from The Living tombstone ?👻
Is that Montryman? 1:15            (Metroman)

2:00 is it just me or does the theme sound like the FNAF 2 song? 🤔
So we going to get a song for each of the Glamrocks? That’s gonna be a wild playlist addition
2:07 I love Monty filming a TikTok 😂 And might just be me but what does a “w” mean?
Does anybody also feels like the volume of the song is oddly low? I thought it was a device problem but I tried with another ones and I still hear it unusually low, anyway, great song!
“How many times have you watched this?”       ~ “20712 times”
MONTY CONENT IN 2025!? WE'VE BEEN BLESSED! 🐊🐊🐊

Can we please get a song for each of the other glamrocks?
how tlt keeps making banger Fnaf songs is a mystery
Who telling Corey about watching this?
Is the mimic here, in this song
Can we appreciate how TLT has been making FNAF songs for more than 10 years? without missing a beat!
Why does it sound like the alistor song. To me it does , Still like it tho.
Does anyone notice that at the start of the video, Monty putts a gold ball with Chica’s face on it. And later in the video, he kills Chica with a golf club to the head.
Is this Notice Me Senpai all over again?
Did anyone notice that at the end of the song? There's the secret of the mimic hippo at the end.
Now who wants to listen to the mimic song !!??
Why did they make Bonnie with a small nose and without his eyeliner??🕊️🕊️🕊️ It looks bad😭💔

2:07 Why does nobody notice the mimic hiding behind the green screen where Monty was taking a photo? Am i the only one??   Also, i found Monty doing the macarena, it's silly tbh  Edit: I just realized that Monty infront of the green screen was actually referencing the burger king 'join us for a bite' meme
What's wrong with the Living Tombstone? It seems they're being prevented from making bad songs.
Who is feat?
IS FNAF BACK?!!
It’s great but why are your songs only like 2 minutes long nowadays? They don’t last nearly long enough. You need to add a bridge or something before the final chorus. 😢
…months intrusive thoughts?
Why did you just recreate Alastor's game ?
Was that a die in a fire shot with Monty destroying Freddy?
Can you make a song for the other characters like Freddy chica Roxy and Bonnie?
Idk anything about this game, does this happen or not?
"Man this song's great! And the animation's so cool-" 2:06 "IS HE MAKING A TIKTOK-  *IS THAT THE JOIN US FOR A BITE DANCE???????"*
1:03 anyone else saw the mimic in the window?

Why the hell is clean o vac at 2:08
Wasn't Monty innocent? Didn't many youtubers prove he didn't kill Bonnie? And In a roller Coaster, it shows Bonnie handing Monty the Guitar.

What genre of music is this?
Of all characters why monty?
Why does the music sounds so whimsical while Monty kills everyone 😭🙏🥀💔
THEY MADE ANOTHER ONE?!! also, this is the first TLT FNAF song that is only about one specific character, which is cool!

Did anyone realize that Monty in Secret of the Mimic was supposed to be used in Fredbears, and then Bonnie replaced him with Freddy Fazbear and the Gang, and then now Monty destroys Bonnie as revenge? I think that's a pretty cool parallel.
