Why is it called iOS26 as being released in 2025 would have thought it would be iOS25
Is there any change regarding multitasking? Any split view? Any slide over?
Yawn. How about a more intuitive keyboard and number row? Something ALL users would benefit from multiple times a day.
what about battery 😂😂 battery would drain like nothing
Wait, what year is it?
No iPhone 17 announcement??
So they wanted it to look like a cheap third party Android launcher from 2017?
All they did was make em transparent? Y’all are acting like they did something crazy lol we had this back in the day during the jailbreak Cydia days
How about android 26..-used phone android 😮
Remember when Windows 7 had a transparent UI? 🤌
Will it be available on an iPhone 15?
So it's windows aero? From Windows 7?
How do we do the messages background

I was really excited for delivery on a better operating system for the iPad, making it more of a computer like experience. I didn't see that in the video. Did that get done or did that not happen? Pretty disappointing if they did not do that.
What about round icons
Wait... Why's it called iOS 26?
Am I risking something if i update to the beta? And will the battery be worse ?
Still No split screen? 😔
What happened to the previous ones
Will we be able to closse all tabs not slide each one?
Why is the design illegible in places and terribly overshadowed? Otherwise it looks interesting.

Has the “Books” app been refreshed? I use it a lot and I kind of want to see how it looks like now.
I hate that time expanding crap on the lock screen, can I turn that off?
