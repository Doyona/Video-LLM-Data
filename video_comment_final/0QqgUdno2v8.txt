Is somebody in there? Really?
Stupid ass questions he is asking a child “is the car unlocked”???? The kid is smarter than he is!!!
What’s dumb question?? Didn’t the boy tell you his mom is in the car??? Really dude?? What do you mean is somebody there ??? What do you mean is somebody there ???
Is the car unlocked?  Dude
Was she saved ????
Great rescue. Did victim hate cops 5 minutes before, as the left teaches people to do?
Why did they blur the mom’s dace but not the boy’s?
anyone talking about how slow the officer was in the first few moments???
is it jusr me or should she not even be allowed to drive fullstop if she suffers from seizures !!
Woman: *clearly screaming* Cop: “is anyone in there?”
Why tf did the cop ask the little boy if the car was unlocked? What a stupid question..! Just go check!!
the kid literally sobbing and screaming to help her mom who is sinking in the car The cop who’s literally looking at the sinking car: “is somebody in there?”
is she ok now? how's the boy? he was so brave. God bless them both and the rescuers.
Where is that officers glass breaker? I always wear mine on my gear to break windows under water...
Who is filming this....?
Why the heck that she was even driving if she knew that she had seizure attacks now and then? Really mind-boggling.
Is somebody in there 😂😂😂😂😂 no a ghost drove it off the road 🤦‍♂️
So, what's the follow-up on this, was the mom okay?
Well what happened????  I'm too involved now!!!
Why was that woman allowed to drive if she can have seizures that result in this at any moment?
Cop: is she there? loading ... is somebody in there? loading ... is the car unlocked? Vid description: Samaritan ...   I'm shocked, how is she still alive after all?
Cops.filming instead running?!?!?!
Why didn't he believe him right away? The kid said seizure, she's in the water/car, she's sunk...why call out? is that procedure? Seconds matter
No way is that Liam from shameless?
Why he asked was anybody else in there when he just told him shes in the water? Why he's taking his time like that
Is somebody in there??  what an idiot
Why he ain’t believe the boy still asking is somebody in there? Hurry up foo !!   ❤GLAD EVERYONE OK❤
Poor baby…😢 Is she okay?
Is there someone in there is the car unlocked !?! Boy if that ain’t your job checking I don’t know what is
And trying to open door by handle???? Bro
Why was bro asking so much and not doing
Is it just me or is that cop a bozo it took this idiot of a cop all this time just to rescue someone he taking his sweet time
Who decided to film it though? That’s always my problem in believing these videos.
How is she doing?
What a brave child thank God she was saved ....But wait, why are there pictures of this tragedy? How was this rescue filmed even under the water. Was this a cop??
Is somebody in there 😮 after the boy said his mom is in there having a seizure? Unbelievable 😮😮😮
Why is he asking INSTEAD OF VISUALLY CHECKING??the boy was very clear saying she was in there!!
"Is somebody in there?"  *I hear you kid but I don't want to get wet for nothing*   Good and smart son.
I'm sorry but the camera needed to be stable while the the officers tried to retrieve the mother. I saw nothing but blurry water. Did I they rescue the mother? Was she alive?
Having seizures and allowed to drive?  My lord.
Is somebody in there? Really? Damn you're smart
Could the Cop have taken any longer to get moving? Jesus
That cop acted with 0 urgency, wtf was he even doing?
Was that a minion
The officer cannot swim? Instead he jump in, he asking is anyone there.😮
If this is police officer, why didn't he radio for help?
Woman:👩🏾screams ow my foot, i cant move  Pig:👮‍♀️ is anyone in there?
." Is she in there?.. She cannot answer the question she drowning man! I bet he didn't want his uniform wet.
How can you film in such a moment?
Why was the cop so fkn slow istg 🤬
how did that even happen
Why on earth was this poor child being videoed at this terrible time of his life?
How it (clearly) ended ?…
OMG does she have a history of seizures? If so she should not be driving
Why is she driving around with a child, or even at all, having a seizure disorder? wtf.
Is someone in there? Meanwhile kid saying my mama is in there…
What type a question is that? Is she in there?🤦🏽
Is somebody in there? Like bro I swear
Is somebody in there wooow 😂
Was she in my her phone?
What i want to know is,did she survive 😢
I love how they have zero rush to get to her. What are they doing ?!?!?!
Omg, please tell me that that sweet boy and his momma made it? And if so can we send to them? Would love to help that boy and his momma out.
Couldn't the officer move a little quicker? The boy had to tell him so many times :( even I felt his anxiety 😔
Why are tgey driving knowing they have this problem which can come out anytime?!!
“Is somebody in there?” As the kid is yelling his mama is in there… get a clue, officer
I wonder how the boy got out if there was no open windows and the doors were locked. Was it just the pressure of the water that made it hard to open? I didn't think it was deep enough for that to happen.
Why is someone filming this.
Is that cop stupid
“ is somebody in there?” Bro literally said his mom was in there like 3 times😂
"Is somebody in there?" Like where, hiding at the bottom of the lake?   Like she's gonna pop out and scare him?  🙄
Whats the  Psyche behind killing your family members?? Why does this seem so normal in America
Why keep asking the same question about her being in there to the child?! Did he not believe him he was soaking wet himself and clearly he wasn’t the driver
Is the car unlocked.... Maybe we should wait and see if she gets out.
She would have had to been in the water for quite some time! Does anyone Know if she survived?
Was that a snake they threw off her?
Why is he asking a panicked child a load of questions? Just get out to the car and see for yourself!
"Is somebody in there?" Its like hoping someone just gonna come out from that water😂
Can someone tell me why he still yelled if someone was in the car when he was told there was someone in there? I feel like those could have been precious time wasted but maybe there is something i dont know
Are those question always a requirement before saving someone that is obviously about to die?
Did she survive, and if she did is she well?
That cop doesn’t want to get wet 😅😅 hence ask a ridiculous questions “is somebody in there? 😅😅 and kids repeating “save mom” 🤦‍♂️
No calls to defund the police? How about comments on 'systematic racism'?
Is anybody in there? What the fuck
No one can here is someone in there?.
It really sucks that these video uploaders provide zero context, and zero resolution.  Why do yall subscribe to these idiots?  I mean, they don't even pay their commentors for their work..........? Hello?!?! McFly?!?!?!
How did this story end? How are the boy and the mom?❤
How did this happen?
Why that cop asking the dumb question of is anyone in there?  Obviously that's why the kid crying
What a shitty cop. Instead of rushing to save the person he was already told was in the car he took the time to ask stupid questions.
Jesus he took his sweet time getting to the car didn't he?
Did the mother live? So scary for that poor baby
How you going to ask if there's somebody in there twice or somebody beating on the window and then you're going to walk hesitantly up to the car when a child is begging you to take you there cuz his mom's in the car having a seizure
“Is somebody in there?!” Oh hey yea just knitting a sweater how ya doin?? GO GET HIS MOM WTF
Why does it always take so much effort to make a cop do the right thing ... the boy had to scream to go save her when he was literally in front of the car, watching it drown
Can this officer be any slower and have more questions before he decides to go in the water and help!
Why he was filming and taking his time
How does this even happen? "Save me whyt peepoo, I dun ba mizthake!"
“is somebody in there?” wth kinda question is that
And he gets his phone to video it.   Good lord what are we coming too?
Lmao is she in there?? No this was just one big prank officer take us to jail now.
Why didn’t they call for an ambulance?🚑
Can you move any slower?
Is somebody on there???
Is someone in there nooo it’s just the wind
Why the hell do you post only the beginning of a story and never the whole thing? It drives mr crazy. What's the point?!
Why is he asking if someone’s in there if they would be under water
Why would she drive if she know she's prone to seizures.?
Am I the only one who tears came down?
"Is she in there?" "Is somebody in there?" "Is the car unlocked?" "Does she have her license and her registration?" He is picking every possible dialogue before doing the objective, and this is how you properly play an RPG
Why do people feel the need to record put the phone down so you have two hands!
Did she survive?
If they couldn't get into the car to get the mom, then how'd he get out?  Poor boy, he was so scared, but he did so good by fighting through the terror to go get help!
The kid says his mom is stuck in the car, and the woman is heard screaming from inside the car, but still he has to ask, "Is somebody in there?"
“Is somebody in there?” 🙄 broooo she is drowning. She cannot respond
Very unsatisfying...couldn't see the victim...is she alive?
“Is there anybody in there?” What kind of question is that bruh he just told you there was like 3 times
How did the car end up in the small pound thought it’s not even close to the road ??
Did really had to film? I think it would be faster if he didn't document this moment! What's wrong with you people??
What the hell was she doing driving with a seizure disorder? These guys risked their lives to save her
Did she survive? She was in there for awhile
how long does someone have to be unconscious underwater for them to be un savable even with cpr
Why the fuck is he just walking all slow. Save the fucking women
Is the cop afraid of water or something? Hurry tf up, she's losing brain cells while you fuck around.
How did the boy get out?
Did she survive?
Is someone in there what the hell smh
she’s alive???
Why the cop so slow at the start even tho the kid went to the water
But why is this boy in the water 💦 like that ? And “is the car unlocked “ huh 🤔?
She was drunk?
Why is he moving so damn slow??
Why is she driving,is my question with her medical condition? Someone isn't telling the truth about there medical condition to DMV, or she is driving with a driving license.
Is somebody in there? 🤦🤦
This remands me the "are you chocking???"
What do they mean is someone in there he told him his mom was having a seizure and is drowning
Why did it take the cop so long to get in the water?
Did she survive?  Poor boy 😢. God Bless him for helping save his Mom ❤ & the one who responded & helped♥️
Why is the cop asking questions get tf in the water
How did she even get a driving license?, lm glad she found help but this could have ended badly if she was to be on the freeway or something
Filming or rescuing??
That friggen COP MAN!! The boy is SOAKED and he’s asking is she in there  -he says she was!-and is it unlocked ? Like RESCUE IS MOM DUDE
Who filming it?
“ is she in there? Is there somebody in there? Is the car unblocked?” no… didn’t you see her in the corner of the video sipping on the margarita sitting on a floaty. Ppl ask some dumb questions in serious situations like this one
Maybe I missed it but does anyone have the GoFundMe link to this?  Any news updates on Mom’s condition?
Defund the police?! 🚔  defend the blue! 💙 thank God for heroes.
“Is somebody in there?” Seriously, how much stupid are you? And he takes a video.
Should people who have seizures be able to drive?  Why is their driving privilege more important than public safety..? Too many terrible accidents caused by seizures... its preventable
Is she still alive?
Howd he get out though??
If the windows are up, how did the boy get out?
Why did he ask if anyone was in there? 🤷🏽‍♀️
Was she ok?
Is this a police camera?
How on earth did she survive that long underwater, with her body out of control???   I lost my breath just waiting for her to be brought out!
Why can’t cat manufactures out in some kind of device that will be alerted if the car is submerged in a certain amount of water that auto-unlocks the damn doors better yet OPENS them just a little so people can at least push there way out of 5 feet of water?!  I understood pressure but many more people go into shallow water like this or into ravines on sides of roads where pressure isn’t a major issue, hm🤔
Is the cop brain dead?
“Is she in there? Is the car unlocked? Is her insurance up to date? Are her tags expired? What’s her favorite color….”
what was he carrying it seemed very small? is she okay now?
Bro, sitting in the back talking about is somebody in there while they said she fainted and she’s having a seizure?😂
There was someone in a bright color shirt already at the door trying to open it……..but not mentioned?
This is sad, but if she is prone to having seizer's, why is she driving? She puts herself in danger and everyone else.
Really, he had to ask, is she in there?  Is somebody in there? The kids had already told him she was having a seizure and was in there. SMH.
Cop was like “but do I really have to help?”
Why was the cop moving so slow at first
Did she live?
What a shame no sense of urgency… asking if the door is unlocked???? WTF , thank God for the Good Samaritan
That police officer was annoyingly hesitant wasn’t he!? Asking sunken people in a car if they’re alright and in there…😮 seconds saves lives!
Did the mom make it??? Just curious about people doing what should be done!!! Seriously, I can’t think of this any other way!!! I would have saved her for certain!!
Why he asking is someone in there is she is there it was not the police officer at all 😢😢 but they job is to what
My God can the cop move any slower?
*audible screaming and yelling*  Cop: is somebody in there?
Wondrous human drama. Did that punch not work under water?
Did he lock the doors on the way out?🤔
So was she saved?
I hope she’s okay!! Did she live? Her son loves her so much, he kept it together enough to tell the cop. I was not this strong when I was young, amazing for him, I do hope he saved her.
Was she saved??
Did she make it? Anyone know?
Was everyone OK? Good cops are awesome.  Bad cops should take note
Did she live?
Do we know if she made it?
So what the f was he asking that traumatized kid questions for? Like go help.
Okay but where is this cop’s sense of urgency?!?
Thank God he got help for her, but why was she driving if she’s epileptic?
Is she okay now???
Did his mother survive?
This is extremely traumatizing for me to watch. You are leaving us wondering if that women survived for which chances were zero. As somebody who lost their mother in a carcrash I wish you didn't show me this video. What is that giving anybody? Is this about clicks???
Why did you cut it off when you did?
Why was he asking if somebody's in there like what did he expect them to be able to answer while they're underwater? And I heard the voice tell him that she was having a seizure
That poor baby is so scared, hurts my heart.. how is his mama?
Did she definitely survive? I hope that sweet angel isn’t too traumatised and that mama is feeling better xx
Is she alive
Who would be filming instead of helping?
If th child got out then th door he came out of wld of been unlocked????
Is she in there, sounded like he ain't wanna go ! Is the car unlocked wth??? Smdh cop ain't no hero the kid is cop ai t have to swim and he damn near took too long asking stupid questions!
Does anyone know what happened to the mother??
How about promoting these type of videos around election time.
Is somebody in there?? I don’t want to get wet if there isn’t …..smh
Did she live?
Did the mom make it?😢
Does anyone know if she is OK?, the sons' pleads broke my heart 💔 Thank you, @bhumphries1360 for the update,  I pray she'll makes a full recovery 🙏🏼 ❤️ 🥹
Does anyone know  if she survived and doing okay?
Do we know if the mom survived?
Damn, could he have moved any slower?!!! 😡
Who's filming this rescue but not helping?
Is this some type of joke. What they pulled out looks like a snake.
How did the car end up upside down. ??
Dang.....it seemed like that device took a long time to break window?
He's so brave, is she ok? God bless them both.  Thank God for the office.
Why dnt they ever show the whole rescue
I thought epileptics weren't allowed to drive ? I'm UK based, so maybe it's different elsewhere.
How did the kid get out of the car?
Is stupid the Police or hándicap.?
Why is a woman with seizures driving with her children in the car?
"Is somebody in there?", "is the car unlocked?"................ the little boy is literally telling him his mom is in there having a seizure.....
Is She dead?
Why was he recording it?
Is somebody in there ?  Really !!??
why is the cop going 2 mph when (rushing) to an 80% sunken car with a woman inside
Is he really considered a hero for doing a job he's paid to do??
I don't understand why the men were moving so slowly?
The cop was doing his job ,the factiry workers just being good humans ...bravery ???? Heros ? I m confused by this .odern age were everyone is a hero by just doing what humans should be doing ..nobodies life was on the line so were is Bravery awards appropriate...i think the child deserves acilaids and big thanx fir sure  to the officer and the gentlemen that helped ...but the rest of the awarded this and that ..let such things stat orivate between a pwrson saved and those who saved them ..we do nt all need media attention and awards ...just my oppinion ,nobody needs to agree or disagree you can have your own oppinions ...
Not taking ANYTHING away from this story - but honestly how/why/who was the camera man here?? Did the little boy find a cop? Bodycam?
How do you drive into a lake in a road like that?
There are sooo many people (men/women) in the world (billions); WHY WOULD YOU SUBJECT YOURSELF TO THIS  TROUBLED MAN?? Geez Jennifer, it's ok to be alone.
Is somebody in here? (×2) wtf??? Like bro the kid obv said that
Did stand there and ask is somebody in there 🤣😂🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
Isn't that his job
How in the HELL did bro end up in a lake? Come on mom
Was she saved?? I don't see that here.
Why is the cop not showing ANY sense of urgency? Ew!
Is someone in there this kid screaming my moms in there ??
How did they end up in the water?
Jesus, pigs man “is she in there?” how stupid do you have to be?
Well, then what’s happening now? Is he adopted or is he? Is he OK? Is he in a safe place?😢
Why he asking dumb as questions 🤔
Is there an update? Praying for this family. What a brave boy.
I think her son did what any normal child would do given the circumstances. Why does he have be brave to ask strangers for help in an unexpected crisis like this? Is there something not being said? Are the strangers from another planet? We’ve seen animal portrayals do the same in a crisis, asking humans for aid, well not asking, that’s brave. No this wonderful young man should have every expectation of aid.
cop so slow, “is someone in there?” boys coming to you crying, get a clue, wtf, should be ready to give all you can in a moment
Does anyone have news about this mother and son? 🙏🇧🇷
How he get out of the car but she didn't?
How would the cop hear the mom calling out? Calling for her wasted time. Luckily she’s safe
Was she saved? Poor lad, it must have been terrifying
I WONDER HOW THE SON GOT OUT I THINK IT'S HARD TO OPEN A DOOR UNDER WATER LIKE THAT, AND THE WINDOW MUST HAVE BEEN UP SMHH 😮WHAT A BRAVE LITTLE BOY TRYING TO GET HELP TO SAVE HIS MOTHER THANK YOU JESUS ❤
Is she ok?????
Bless that baby!! Now, if momma has seizures, why is she driving?
Is mom alive what happened is everyone ok the cops his urgency was delayed dramatically in my humbled opinion.
What a brave little boy!  Was she saved?!!
Is his mom okay 😢
Did the mom survived ?
"Is she in there?"  No shit sherlock!
Did they save her!!!?
Omg is she ok???
Why he just didn't jump in the water and look for the child's mother to save her from drowning? Some people or should I say them people!!!
Really-_- is there somebody in there?
Poor kid. What is someone with epilepsy doing driving a car? With a kid in it?
Why is everyone moving more urgently than the cop whose job it is to actually help??? Bro crying for help and he’s taking his time walking to the car asking if someone’s in there like bro didnt say from the BEGINNING his mom is in there having a seizure…
Is somebody in there?       ..  buuhplblup blup bllhhhlllupp bhhhlluuoop
Why does the lack of urgency frustrate meeeeee like don’t panic but move quicker seconds matter when saving lives
🧍‍♂️ is somebody in there?
Is someone in there? No bozzo.. they're just fishing 🤨
Is that a snake
Does anyone know the outcome of this accident?
Cop asked if the car is unlocked? WTF
Why wasn't he running to save her? Oh, I see, it's another bystander.. because he dam sho wasn't in a hurry..
Is she in there,is anybody in there?okay just wondering. Like bro! If i saw a vehicle like this am jumping in ASAP
Ok but was she saved?
how the fuvck did they end up in there
Is h asking the child if she is in there is crazy
She is save now?
Was she chasing after them Duke Boy's again?
Is somebody in there what a dumb
A young black man who is in distress and the cop doesn't shoot him? Clearly fake video
Good Samaritan cop? That’s his job?
Man stabbed to death, blood everywhere...  Officer: Sir are you ok, Sir why aren't you answering me?  🤦‍♂️
This might be a dumb question but im curious; are the body cams waterproof?
Where tf did she get her license from? A fucking cereal box?
Him hesitating asking “is someone in there” pissed me off..if she was incapacitated and couldn’t respond it’d be like, “no?? Nobody?? Okay.. well good news kid she’s not inside 😄”
Did the mom survive???
“Is she in there? Is somebody in there” Dudes he’s been crying out that his mom was stuck in there from the beginning. Thank God for the braveness of everyone and that she was rescued 🙏🏾♥️
God bless this child. Why isn't he on the national news? Why don't we hear about stuff like this?
why was she in the water?
Is she in there?
Poor kid to go through that. I am troubled that he knew what it was. Should she have been driving? Did she epilepsy and how well was it controlled?
"Is the car unlocked?" Sir, who the fuque cares?
Why didn’t the kids try and help?
Good Samaritan?!? That's a cop, doing his duties. Not a "Good Samaritan"
The slow approach "Is somebody in there?" is the most stressful thing for me. She's having a seizure and is under water. She can't breathe. How is she supposed to to talk? Rush in there and save her
So am I the only one thinking this cops reaction time was irritating? The kid said she's had a seizure, save her. You see a car in the water, fuckin get in there!!!
How much does that poor kid look like Liam from _"Shameless"_.
Did they save her
Should people that have seizures be allowed to drive?
Stupid fucking cop, “is somebody in there?” Like, no shit detective! Asking stupid questions like the submerged recently seizures woman is going to him, open her door, and give a thumbs up.
Heartbreaking - boy was so overwhelmed yet strong and determined. How did that boy get out yet all doors were locked?
Having a seizure in the water for that long??.... yeah no sorry, this is fake asf
Could he go any slower?
“Is somebody in there?” “ mom! “ so a drowning person possibly passed out from seizure is suppose to answer you?
Not entirely sure what happened entirely, but where is this cops desperation?
Am I the only one with tears listening to the boy tears and crying out for help?  Glad the officer and the Good Samaritan helped but that officer wasn’t moving fast enough for my liking …, .. I pray the lady is ok and if she has seizures she STAY FROM DRIVING because she could’ve killed herself, her son and anyone else on the road…
But did she catch a fish?
Update? Is the ,mother and children doing okay? Regardless child shows good strength in resilience leadership and courage characteristic traits. Hopeful they found the mother in time that they reunited
Is the car unlocked? Go find out wtf? Is somebody in there? Yeah dude do you not hear the kid? What planet is this dude on?
Is the officer srsly that slow trying to save a life?
Did she survive ? ❤
Is that Liam from Shameless?
The officer broke the window to save the mother.   What did he use?   It wasn’t a hammer. 😊lease let us know so we are also prepared in the event we come across something like this or even for our own safety from inside the vehicle
Is somebody in there? Nah, the cast just drove itself in the water.
Feeling sad for the boy😢 Also I don't get it, if mom knows she gets seizure, why driving a car in the first place? Poor boy. He have to witness it and will never never forget this incident when he grows up! God bless this family 😢❤❤❤❤
Why is the cop so slow 😡
How tf u pick up a lil boy saying his mom was in there and still ask "is someone in there"   obviously she not gonna fuckin answer
Did this woman make it?
why are we driving with epilepsy?
Is there  a follow up to this story
Are cops good Samaritans by default for doing their job?
Did he pull her out too?? I can't tell who brought her over
I wonder how yall even think about recording, let alone take the device with you and film while  you  rescue someone's life.
Oh my GOD Is she ok ?
Does Amy one know how this turned out? That boy is such a hero, as well as that man who helped them.
When every second counts it pissed me off for him not to automatically react, like if he was scared to get into the water or something.....is somebody in there? Is the car unlocked? Really?
Did she survive?😮😢
How is she doing now😮
Poor baby 🥹 Did she make it?
Did he not believe the kid or what?
Why he so slow
who was the good samaritan??? i hope u not saying the cop was a good samaritan!
Why do I feel like he's moving too slow.. I feel that kids desperation 😢❤
How did the kid get out of the car?
why he moving so slow asking is somebody in there did that frantic child seem like he was making sht up to u ida hit that water on my belly and skid across the top getting to that lady every second is oxygen lossdamage
Why tf is she driving
Why was that man ASKING THAT Dumb question? The baby came ran up to him saying save my mama, She’s in the car. She having a seizure. COME ON PEOPLE
Since the boy knew she was having a seizure, does this mean she was knowingly driving a car with a history of seizures? Is it legal to drive?
Is she in there? Is the door unlocked?? Wth! Take action! Ask questions later !
Why is the woman driving if she knows she has seizures…
Is she in there is about the dumbest question
Any update? Was she okay??😢
What a dumb cop. What type of question is "Is there somebody in there?"
Why did the cop stand around and ask if anyone was in there????
Cops be stupid AF sometimes is she in there is someone in there?! Naa the kid just ran found you and said she having a seizure she sunk she's in the water 😂😂😂 I need to be a cop to see what I do in high stress situations can't be worse than the military.
Since when are cops samaritans?
Is there a update on the woman's condition...I would like to know if she is ok
All non chalant "is the car unlocked., really dude?
Did they save her?
Him calling hello? Is someone in thr is crazy work
Did she live?
How does everyone have a cam ?
Anybody know if she made it?
Cop a bit too calm there at first.  Questions, questions..." is car unlocked?"   Bruh, kick it into high gear my guy
Good Samaritan?  That's his job.  Samaritans don't get paid.
How could he be so sloww...the cop I mean
Does anyone know how the mama is doing?
Why is the cop getting credit
Por que não tentaram pelo porta malas? Why didn't they try to open the trunk of the car?
Did she survive?
Is the car unlocked? Who would remember that in this situation, much less a child.
Is that Liam from shameless?
Could he move any slower?
Liam from Shameless???
Does the cop still get kudos since he's a evil "white man"?
The boy cries desperately for his mommy but, was he saved himself? God bless him for being brave 😢
Is somebody in there? Is the car unlocked? Get your ass in that water and save that black woman.
Why was he walking so slow…?
Do I dare ask how the mom even ended up in a damn lake, or...
I know you gotta stay calm but damn a little urgency wouldn't hurt. Is someone in there? Like the kid didnt run up saying his mom having a seizure and drowning lol he still asks "is someone in there"?
He going to ask if somebody's in there😂😂 ... Bro?!?
Did she survive??????
Does anyone know if she made it?😢
Giving the kid all credit about saving his mom, what about the cop and the other person who did the actual life saving work? Give credit where credit is also due people.
Did she live?
And How is it dramatic? The child is afraid for his mom??
Is someone in there 👀 depressed 😔 really...kid said it's his mom😢crazy it slow motion
The fact that the kid already told him like 3 times his mom was in the water and the cop is still like is someone in there ?
Good Samaritan? He has a duty
Is anyone under there we know you maybe having a seizure and can't respond but are you under there. The level of emergency service usefulness.😂
She either got very lucky or it was divine intervention?  Either way most people that find themselves in that situation don’t live to tell about it
Why this didn’t make shaderoom? lol it’s some good ppl out here !💙
Wym good samaritan cop? Isnt this his job?
How did the child get out? Tge doors are shut!!
She's alive???
Did she survive?😮
The dumbass cop asking "iS Somebody i there ?" 🤡
How can you talk to someone under water.
How did he even get out of the car in the first place!  Such a brave kid! I'm crying 😢
is the car unlocked?
She has seizures but drives? Omg
Im glad she is safe and the child can be relieved but I'm starting to see a trend about people crashing out into bodies of water. What can we do to fix that?
Why the cops move so slow...
Did she survive?
Does anybody know what happened to her and her son ? 😢
I wonder why it's called good Samaritan and not good Palestinian.. oh right. Samaria.
Why tf are you asking is somebody in there when the boy already told you it is ?????
He looked all wet as if he was in the car!! so how did he get out?
Is somebody in there? lol
@fayemcarthur4609 How do you know anything about this were you there?
Oh my how is she??? How is the little boy???😢😢😢😢
Is somebody in there?! MY MOMMA! is the car unlocked? Ffs help her!
Is black take your distance go for some donut or something more interesting
What the hell is a good samaritan Cop? There job is to assist. Then yall wonder why people don't rely on cops for nothing!!
Why tf was that cop hesitating to go get her, the child had to get in before doing anything🤦‍♀️
Why does he have to ask if she is in there?
Wtaf that cop seemed to relaxed for someone to be in that situation??!
Why the cop ask annoying question i was like hurry up bro stop wasting time she is dying
Good Samaritan? He’s a cop it’s his job not to mention he had zero sense of urgency and wasn’t even the one to get her out.
Why do these people who have seizures drive they should be banned from driving
Wtf was that cop tapping on the car window? Zero effort to actually break the glass
Did she survive?
What part of his mom was in there?! 😣
How's the mom now? Is her boy able to cuddle with her now?
Was his Mama saved? I so hope
How many times did the kid have to TELL HIM SHE WAS IN THE CAR but the cop KEPT ASKING, "IS SHE IN THERE", "IS SOMEBODY IN THERE?"...really??? THE KID WAS SCREAMING FOR HIS LIFE!!!!
I'd love to hear about the rest of this story..does anyone know how mom made out after they got her to hospital?
He‘s not really a Good Samaritan in the classical sense tho is he? He‘s a cop he‘s doing his job. He‘s a good cop that is what he is
Some body known if she is okey??
“Is somebody in there?” My guy we just frantically drove here bc somebody is.
How did the child get out of the car? Doors locked, windows up after?
Did she make it  My goodness
Why tf did he scream at the car is somebody in there w Hen clearly the car is going underwater ? Everyone knows you couldn’t open a car door under water even if it was unlocked 🤦🏽‍♀️Next. Good job
Is it just me or was this copper a little bit too relaxed
It drove me nuts the way the cop stood there and kept asking "is anyone in there?" Like dude, this kid has already told you multiple times that someone is in there! What are you waiting for??
"Is somebody in there?" was crazy. Bro had no urgency. 😐
Was she saved?
But why is she driving a car if she normally have seizures? That’s irresponsible
why does they allow people that have a history of seizure to own a license? I mean you don't allow total blind people to drive so why? This kind of illness can potentially endangered themselves and everyone while driving and having an attack midway.
The kids tells the cop my mom in their, and cops said, is someone in there? What a stupid  question.    😂
cop just going for a light swim ? hustle bro wtf
Bro why is he asking if someone is in there? The boy LITERALLY told him that already. What’s with his delay in reaction?💀🤦🏾‍♂️
Was the lady ok? I was worried when they blurred her face out! They usually do that when they are deceased!! I hope all that rescue work was worth it!!
Is somebody in there? The boy just said she was! Precious seconds, stupid questions. Just my opinion.
Is this the lil kid that was singing do it again if they look alike
Question !  How the car ended up there ?
Why the cop act so slow?
Did she have a seizure? or did something else happen? It’s an African American driving a dodge charger could have just been speeding and drove into the water
Did she survive?
Where was this guy when Ted Kennedy was around?
Good samaritan? Isn’t this their job to serve and protect?
Cop a Samaritan?  Isn't this, like, his job??? So he is payed for that ??  That's not a samaritan
Why was the cop even asking questions. Like dude just go
Is there an update 😢😢
Sstupid police, question questions. Is anybody there? He ask the boy told him very loud and clear that his mother is in the water POS
So, how did the kid get out? Hope mom wasn't injured.
Did his mama survive ya al??😢😢
wtf is the cop doing? “Is someone in there?” As the two people are begging for help
Good samaritan cop?Isnt it his fucking job and not an altruistic act ?!
“Is somebody in there?” The kid told you she was buddy. Also, I don’t think she can hear you.
Why tf is he asking the 8 year old questions? You are supposed to exhibit confidence and give the kids a sense of you know what tf your doing. Officer fails here in all ways!
The dumbest people wearing badges...sunken car and "is somebody in there...?" 😂😂 reply - "gup-gulp-gulp!
Why is he asking before he goes in  when the kid is obviously upset ?
Does anyone have an update? Did the mom make out ok?
Is there someone in there? Really?
I would love to know the entire story. Were police called, and if so, by who? Or did they just happen to be driving by? Was it truly a seizure? Is she ok? This is an amazing thing, to (potentially) have saved a life.
“Is the door locked?” come on bro
Rescues? He asked the most ridiculous questions before he would act. The kid told him his mom was in there. He then asks "is she in there? Are the doors locked?" GIVE ME A BREAK!
Why did that cop take his sweet ass time though
Seizure diving? How did she get a license? The kid clearly knows his mother is epileptic. So sad
Any de-fund the police lunatics out there?
How do you come in as an officer to serve and protect but think about yourself first is crazy to me .
Is somebody in there😢
How did the police arrive in just enough time to save her ?  Did the kids have a phone or just miracle luck that a officer came by ?
How many times is he  going to ask is  someone in the car when the child said his  mom , I felt like  this took sooo long 😢
What is the update? Is she ok?
How are you gonna see the water moving and ask if someone is in there
How’d the kid get out tho?
Did they resuscitate her?! Who edited this?! Dear God what's wrong with you!
someone is there,.? for real,...the boy gets to you,...the boy drives with you, and because its water you ask if someone is in there,...????
Did anyone get to read the true outcome? Or are the comments of being saved, assumptions? I can’t find the rest of the video that’s why I’m asking, to see if she truly made it. I pray 🤲 she did. That boy did all he could. He was all wet from being in the water too. 😢
Is the car unlocked?😮
"Is somebody in there?" Dumb question when the boy already said so. What a waste of time and a lack of swift action.
Where is this cop’s sense of urgency? Seconds count.
Whay?police use like 15min befor going in or runn to safe them😂😂😂come on crazy
U guys sure momma survived? She was under water for a good while it looks like
Did she live?
Is anyone in there?  Is the car unlocked? That kid was way more competent than the cop...at least they helped. 🤦‍♂️
Jeez, sense of urgency?
iS sOmEoNe In tHeRe? I don't know man, maybe someone just parked their car underwater
Is the car unlocked? Has it been waxed lately?😮
Was she saved? Was she alive?
Is the car unlocked? Is someone in there? Bro he’s going crazy telling you his mom is in there run in there and get her out not the time to ask questions my boy
where is the fire department?
Can't believe some people in the comments are saying he's racist because he asked the question multiple times, oh the state of some poeple 😂
The stupiest question in this Situation. The policeofficer is an idiot, maybe?
Why the f the cops waste so much time calling if somebody in there? Is it some kind of protocol or something?
How did the kid get out of car ?
Did dude really ask if somebody was in there???
Did he have to ask that dumb question tho?
Why is he recording?
Smaritan cop? Or their job
What was the cameraman doing !????
Why where they so chill in the beginning
WHY is someone with seizures ALLOWED To DRIVE?   That is so wrong.
Why's she driving if she has seizures?
Is somebody in there wtf kind of a stupid question is that, the kid told him that his mother was in there and that she had a seizure how the ffff is she gonna reply
“Is she in there?” Like he didn’t want to get wet unless he had to. 🫤Texas is flat land in the middle of nowhere, and we all know how they are so it’s now she’s be knocking on random doors if she did.
Good ending but holding the dam camera could've cost her life, and does lil dude want it in his face in the scariest moment of his life?
Did she make it? Shouldnt be driving with siezues, great work saving mom!❤
Why the fuckdid he ask if somebody was in there.
And the police.. is some one in there?? Maybebif he saw bubbles coming out 😠 😡
What do you mean is somebody in there??? Lmfao why are you guys praising a lazy ass cop that clearly stood still for 10 seconds and asking if someone is in a car under water 💀💀💀
How traumatizing that must’ve been for the child 😢 is she ok?
What happened? Why half video? Is she ok or she died?
Why is she driving if she is prone to seizures?
Is somebody in there? Helloo?? Anyone heerrre??
What is the name of the movie?
I am glad that she was rescued,  but was this her 1st seizure ever?  Because if she had them before, why was she driving? I have a friend who has epilepsy. Although she did not have a seizure for over a year, she is still not allowed to drive and will never will be. It is too dangerous.
Why do they hire the dumbest people to be cops?
What happened were they able to save her
Is someone in there what a stupid question when the kid is screaming his mom is in there
why did it take a minute for a cop to go in there?
Is she in there is the car unlocked stupid questions should've broke the window
Why are you posting some like this for views?
Is it just me or was the officer moving to slowly when every millisecond counted
Why was the cop going so slow?
Is somebody in there? …. Man!!! He told you his MOM was there!!! 🙄🙄🙄slow as F!
How did the woman end up in the water? How did the kid get out but mother could not
Who would have a camera ready for an emergency like that??  I hope she is okay!! 😮
The dumb ass cop standing there eating precious time “is anyone in there” while the boy just told you she was having a seizure?!?!?!
WTF is he so slow?!
Why this police moving at a turtle pace? Geez!
Is thus froma movie or it is for real
Could the cop be any slower
Useless cop dammit!!! 🤬 So exasperating “🤡 is someone in there?” When she had a seizure and is underwater 🤦🏻‍♀️
Why did he scream are you in there?? The son said she was in there, crazy
Dumb ? Is somebody in there?  Is the car unlocked? Just get there and get her out. That boy just broke my heart
I am happy they rescued her but curious question I thought people who have seizures werent able to drive?
I'm so glad that she's going to be ok. But does she have epilepsy? People with epilepsy shouldn't drive at all.
why is he dilly dallying while there is literally a car under water and a boy is screaming that his mom is inside💀
Anyone know if the mom made it?
Could he react a little more slower
Help gurgle gurgle.....is somebody in thurr?
Why is the cop walking up asking if someone's inside?? You got directed there for a reason
Cops asking the kid a million questions what’s her astrological sign?
why do they issue licenses to epileptics? very sad
Why the American police ask so many questions before they actually go out for help????
Did they get her. I hate short younnever get the end .
Is the car unlocked? Cuz maybe I need to clock out of my shift if it isnt.
You had to ask again when you got there did you really think it was a set up Jesus?
"Is anyone in there?" Really?
Whyyyyyy would he ask if some is in there ????? Yes dude ... His momma is
Did this person ask is  somebody in there? And the second question is worse..is the car unlock? Wtf what's next? Are you dead?
Did she live???
Were calling cops doing their job good samaritans now? Didn't have any sense of urgency in the beginning either.
Why did it take the cop so long
She looked pretty dead to me?
Why does he ask twice, if somebody was in there! Just go help! Lost important seconds there!
Bless his heart. Did his mom make it? So traggic and tramatic.
How many people thought of iRobot?
why TF is he shouting is someone in there? he already told him there was. u think shes gonna shout underwater??? Hes wasting time!
If she has  seizures why the hell is she driving?
Could the cop have moved any slower?
Idiot cop asking if someone's in there? WTF
Is someone in there? She underwater bro and she sure ain't aquaman.
Are the doors locked......really?  Try it.
“Is somebody in there?” Is he hard of hearing? The boy told him a few times his mom was in the water 🤦‍♀️
This officer needs more training tf he asking if the door is unlock ? And after being told that his mom is in there he still ask if there somebody in there 😂 he need more awareness
Seizure and in the water? Survival seems very low.
could that cop move any slower and any more nonchallant????
Omg omg omg was she alive ? I hope he didn’t lose his mother
Is somebody in there? Naw what do you think, sir?🙄
How can someone prone to seizures be allowed to drive
Did she live?
Is it just me or was the officer moving ina very non urgent way in the first half ..
Could he have reacted any slower at first. Geeze.
Did they save her? Bless that boy ❤
“Is somebody in there?” I’m stunned
Who the cop be any slower
Dafuq do you mean "good samaritan" cop? That's his job...
“Is she in there”, is somebody in there”, what kind of idiotic questions are those? The boy said she was in the car having a seizure & the cop wasted too much time before helping. 😡
Is someone in there? Like dayum he already tokd you.. and why is the cop so chilled like dayummm hurry up and save em
Why do people with seizure issues drive cars?  that should not be!
So… I have a question. Does she have a known seizure history? If so, she probably isn’t supposed to have her license. Depending on the situation. Because of reasons like this.  I’m glad everyone is ok.
Why is police taking his sweet time?
again, defund who?!
Cops just standing there “is someone in there?” Bro did the screaming kid not just tell you his mom was trapped ??
Is this not the laziest slowest reacting cop on the planet ? It’s like why must you ask if someone’s in there or not ? Afraid to get your dooky wet huh shame I hope she’s ok since every second counts in times like these
Cop: is somebody in there?
“Is anyone in there?” The front of the car is submerged and the kid said his moms in there and was seizing….why are we wasting time?
'Is somebody in there?' What a silly question.
So why does videos like this not go viral like the ones that try to make our police look bad? Most law enforcement are amazing brave people who protect and serve. There are a few bad ones and they just need to be weeded out. I pray that people stop thinking all police are bad, because they are needed. Without them we would have lawlessness.
Could we move any slower. 😢
Who was shooting the video?
Why the fuck did the cop wait so long. The kid clearly told you his mom was in there having a seizure.
They stopped without telling us if she was ok?
Howd she get a license if shes epileptic?
Am I the only one who thinks the cop was way too laid back and slow to act? The good Samaritan was giving his all
I wonder if she was epileptic. He said that she is having a seizure.
Why is she driving as she has seizures?
was the cop a special student in school or what..?
Is somebody in there??? Тхат цоп ис думб.
How did he get out but the doors are locked?
Your first question is "is there someone in there"? If I seen a car in the water and a kids desperate pleas I would be diving in that water fast af
How did the kid get out of the car ..
Can the cop move any slower
How tf did she get in there 😅😅😅 happy it all worked out
Sounds like she’s had seizures before? He seemed familiar with this happening to her.
Why it took the cop so long to get in the water is beyond me
Is the car unlocked? ….
Why do they never fucking put the end of the video !
Could this guy move any slower 😢
Cop was asking dumb questions is someone in there ? Wtf do you think ?
Why is he slow 😭
Could that cop move any slower?
Why was he asking if someone was in there initially and not running to see?  He needed more sense of urgency to check in the beginning.  Was he asking someone else who was standing there?
Is the car unlocked? It’s submerged. Doesn’t really matter.
Is someone in there? How does he expect to get an answer?
Where Is more video ?
Why did the cop act soooo relaxed? Hurry man someone is under water 😭
Where’s his dad at?
Why does she have a license if she has seizures that’s dangerous
How did the boy get out though?
Is the doors unlocked bro wtf kinda dumb question is that
Could he walk any slower
Now how is somebody trapped under water supposed to answer when asked "is somebody there"?
What I don't understand is that if a black person come and ask a policeman for help you got the damn nerve to ask questions and and ask the car that's upside down is there anybody in the water if it was a white person or even thought it was a different color your ass would have jumped in already stop being stupid and help
Why is she driving if she has epilepsi 😔
Boy said she had a seizure and shes stuck in the water "Is she in there? Is somebody in there?" before  even walking towards the water made my blood BOIL!!!!!!!😡 Hope she's okay
How that happened??
Tf is up with the cop?
I hate to think that if this was an ongoing sickness and knew better than to drive…or was 1st seizure  and didn’t know his could happen ???
Who was filming this AND NOT HELPING????
This baby! Is there a way to donate?!
Damn i see sometimes they break the glass in three seconds what was he waiting for? 😢
Cop rescues woman? I saw the cop standing around wasting time like he worked in Uvalde, while the kid rushed to the water to get her out.   Fuck this cop.
Is somebody in there!? No shit, someone’s in there 🙄. What kind of stupid ass question is that and why the hesitation?
How’d the kids get out?
Slow moving cop. “Is she in there”? Sir, did they kid not already establish that? Cops sure love harassing you with questions, but have never actually been good at the listening part.
So did the slow walking cop get back out of the water?? Because I see another man breaking the window and carries her out????
How do you know she survived . The time the cops arrived and the time they took to rescue her mama was a hell of a time.
Where's all the "cops are waycisms" comments now?
“Is somebody in there?” Was the dumbest question
Poor little guy his desperate panic is contagiously heartbreaking I woulda done all I could to help him… I hope his mama is ok now???
If she has seizures why tf is she driving?
Is she in there? Wow
They allow people that have seizures drive??
How lazy and cowardly do you have to be to see a car in the water and before you go in to save someone you have to ask “is anyone out there” as if they can speak mermaid underwater.
Hmm just me or the cop was to calm no sense of urgency?
How lazy of a police officer and cowardly do you have to be to see a car in the water and before you go in and save someone you have to ask “is anyone out there” as if they can speak mermaid underwater.
Why did that cop take so long to get in the water? Even if she had gotten out before he got there and she was somewhere else, he didn't know that. The kid screamed she's in there, and that good Samaritan should not have been the first into the water
What's with the camera- in this situation?
Why are you recording and you sound so calm
Why is he just standing there yelling “is someone in there” instead of going right in to help
Whats with the stupid questions ? Just go and help her
wtf was he doing standing there asking “is there anyone in there?”
Is the car unlocked? 🤔
Anyone in there? Gurrrrgle gurgle. What?
Why would you ask if there's somebody in there when the kid is screaming save my mom.  Like wtf.     Sad by
Yo, is that Liam from shameless?
Wheres the dad? 😂
“Is somebody in there?” Nah we just threw a car in there and sent a really good child actor to get you so we can prank you into wetting your pants….. appreciate the rescue but time is ticking man!!!!
Is that poor Charger okay🥹
Dang that cop should stop with the stupid questions and get to the car! Is someone in there? Is the car unlocked? Shut up and get in there and do the job u r paid very well to do! Poor kid dealing with that!
I wonder if the policeman would have hesitated and questioned again and again if there was someone there if the obviously distressed and terrified kids would have been white.
Is somebody in there😂😂😂
The kid is screaming desperately that somebody is in there...and the cop keeps asking 'Is there somebody in there?' Bloody hell...🤦🏻‍♀️
Why don't show if she alive or not😮
Why are cars so hard to get open in water ?
Is she in there? No the kids lying you dummy. Just hurry tf up
Anyone have an update??
Aren’t you meant to break the back window and climb through there?
How did the kid get out of the car?
That officer doesn't move with any intentions unless it involves a fuggin donut... wtf took dude so long to act?
Why is the cop in slow motion?
Is she ok ?
I am wondering how does he get out of that car😢 in order to look for help?
Is someone in there? I just ran out of breath get in their and save my momma I tried !! I can’t !!! The fear and hurt in that little man’s eyes 😢😢
Godsh,tje kid is telling him that hi's mom is in the car and police oficer stil asking if she' in there,COMO ON OFFICER REALLY????😢
Who was taking the pictures under the water. 😮
🤠is the car unlock ? 😏 Really 😢🤨😵🤯?
How you mean if she is in there? How you if someone is in there ?  🤨
Does anyone know how they are doing? Praying all is well🙏🏾❤️
Why everyone is over looking the samaritan that is helping. He is the tru hero. This wasnt his job or his mom. He just seen someone needed help, stepped up, And carried her out the car.
Why is he moving so slow to act
He's such a good child. How did he get out?
Why are all police slow as fuck in such situations…. All of them
Did the woman survive this 😢?
Wonder why people who are prone to seizures are driving?
Did the cop move at all ridiculously slow speed for someone trapped in a sunken car?
Why would you video this while trying to save some ones life?
Why do police officers have the overwhelming fascination with useless questioning? “Is someone in there”? Yea his mom dumbass , he told u…. “ Is the door unlocked” ? Bruh just try to open it 🤦🏽‍♂️
Is she alright
Did they get her out? Is she ok?? Anybody know? This raised my blood pressure
How come people with seizures are allowed to drive in USA? It this real?
Dude asked if the car was open? How does he figure the boy got out?  If she had been white he would have been in that water without asking dumb questions.
Is she in there? Bro that lil boy ain't crying for no reason, get ur ass in the firefight.
Now that was slow response why ask is she in there is somebody in there? She could have died
good samaritan? isn't that his job? he seemed pretty skeptical when the kid was talking.
I am really curious why people who experience seizures be let them drive on their own by family? There is a case here in our country driving motorcycle and experienced seizure, struck the grilling around the fountain and hit it on top, eye first and skewed through the head.. it is so dangerous please don’t let them drive alone without someone beside them who can handle the wheels
Damn, when a child gets to a window of a submerged car faster than a police officer…..  🤔 something doesn’t seem right. Was there another officer next to the kid at the window? The video isn’t clear.
Where was the sense of fucking urgency SMH
How do we know she lived ? I don’t see that in the vidoe
Lol why did he ask if someone is in there? The boy told you his mama is in there.
Is she alive??
Where is the go fund me for this young man?
What happened in the last 3 mins he got out of the car ? Swam out of the lake and got help ? How old is he . This is beyond bravery.
Was the cop asking the pond if someone was in the car? Wtf
Did she survive????
Was that officer white?
“Is she in there?”  Bro don’t ask stupid questions, get out there NOW!!  You dope
Is somebody in there??? glug glug.
And he was recording.. why?
Jesus, could you move any slower????
Good Samaritan?! Isn't Cops duty to help & protect people?!
Is the car insured.. did your mom pay road tax.. is the car legal to be in the road.. is the check engine light on.. are the tyres legal.. all the while moms drowning hes asking dumbass questions
If the woman was having a seizure why the heck was she driving a car? Ppl that are prone to seizure are forbidden to drive.. 😢😢
Are epileptics allowed to drive in the US?
Why the hell was the minor’s face not blurred, but the adults was? 😅
Why do people that know they have seizures and people who care drive in the first place glad she's OK hopefully
The woman is alive?😢🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
What happened to these people?
What topk so long
Is somebody there 😳
I’m sorry, but wasting time asking “Is somebody in there?” is literally the stupidest f^cking thing ever.
Does anyone know if she made recovery? A seizure while drowning doesn’t sound optimal.
Glad she’s safe but how did she end up in there?
Is there a follow up.. what happened?
why the questions????
Did she survive?????? 😢
"Is someone in there?" Asking a question at the wrong time. Quit stalling and hurry up was all I was thinking.
This cop wasn't very fast.. Is she in there? Is the car unlocked?  WTF move!!
Did she just drive in there
If a kid say someone sinking why tf is the cop still asking for reassurance?
Why did the car fall into the lake?
😮.. . Is somebody in there???  That is a strange question to ask a drowning victim 🤔
The 1st question is, can you answering somebody in the water? Blurp...blup....blup...blup....  🤦🤦🤦
Is somebody in there?? The kid just told u his momma was in there fuckin christ sake.
"good samaritan cop" aren't they supposed to help? Do they suddenly become "good samaritans" when they're not beating up people ?
How the hell did she drive into the water.
How did the boy know it was a seizure? Does she have them regularly? Should she be allowed to drive? She nearly killed both of them.
"Is somebody in there?" Really?
Is she ok??
......anyone annoyed of the dilly dally ?
Tf he take so long for*?
Why the cop is so chilled
Another Covid vaccine victim?
Gators in that water?????????
Could they move any slower.
Is there somebody in there.. i dont think dude has sense of urgency bone in him..   Its like if i dont gotta get wet i aint goin in.. ferrrekkk!!
Why the usa ppl are so damp , the car is under the water and he asking if there any one and walking slow , gooo help them man
How tf can u hear sumbody that’s n the water😠😠😠
does anyone know if she made it or not? They got her out yes but she didn't look alive? hope she made it
Good Samaritan or a cop?  U could tell he didn’t want to go in that water
Why not try access via the trunk. Most cars allow that.
Now, why didn't a blank when the officer got there? He didn't jump in the water and go straight into it. And so they're going to always anybody in New York? And because number one, if you're knocked out you're not gonna say anything, you're gonna travel for anybody to get out if I was at officer, I would already be in that word about prison, without wasting video taxpayers, money LOL.
Why are licenses given to people who have seizures? It’s not the first time I’ve seen this. DMVs and state governors are fully liable
How is this family doing after the incident 😢
Is she in there? Is somebody in there? Every second counts big boy jump in!!!
WHAT A STUPID QUESTION THE CAR IN ON LUCK HELLOOOOOOOO MR👎👎👎👎🤮🤮
Why is he yelling is somebody in there like they gonna hear or yell back in the water.
Maybe instrad of holding the camera to show how nig hero you are use noth hands and brain to actually help!! Why everything must be recorded these dats!???
I hope she’s ok? Seems these videos never post updates.
Why did it take the guy so long???
Could he be any fucking slower ?
None of you big Texans have cables on you, to pull her car out?!
God bless that child !  So what happened people Just upload anything and leave an  inconclusive story ???
Why was that cop so slow.
Why didnt he just save her why did he run off lol
I’m outraged that the officer had the audacity to casually ask   Is she in there?  Is somebody in there?
Is somebody in there? Tf yes you hear uim screaming mom....and going super slow at that
That cop took his sweet time asking is she in there? In somebody in there? He knew damm well she was in there just dint wanna get wet.
Is that Liam from Shameless
How did it finish ? Was she saved ?
Good Samaritan?? He took his sweet time..
How tf does that even happen tho 😂
Not a hero - why did he hesitate and waste time?
🥺🙏🏾❤is she alright?
Did she survive? 😮😢😢
Is she in there? No shit wtf do you think the people in the water are trying to do?
Is she in there lol nah lil homie was drivin😂
Did Mama make it, Praying she gets well
The frustration watching him question “is she in there?” When seconds could count. He was already briefed by the kid that she’s stuck in a car underwater. Why did he have to go back for a window punch, such arrogance that they presumed the child was lying and hesitation when seconds count.
How she end up in the water ?
It toke them that long to break the glass? They pull you out the car for a traffic stop they break it in seconds 😂😂😂
@bhumphries1360 you are awesome for finding out but is there a fund set uo so we can send them money? If she has been in ICU you know they need it and that sweet boy has been waiting by her side the whole time.  Please tellus how to send money!!!
Is somebody in there?? What an idiot
Did she live??????
What happened omg how can you just leave a video like this….that poor baby 😢
Seizure did that ? Why the f she driving a 500hp engine? 💀
Was she saved.?
could that cop move any slower 🙄
The child is literally crying to save her n this 🥷 over here “is there someone in there?” Bro turn in your badge after you get backup 💀
The cop 🤦‍♂️ asking silly questions wasting time! Is anybody in there? Duh dufus the kid just told you they need help
Omg! I hope she is ok? It is not safe for her to drive.
I wonder what happened heart attack I hate to assume it's an OD
Why would u drive knowing you could have a seizure...dangerous for everyone
What the hell is the cop doing asking if someone's in there can he not swim wtf is wrong with this guy
Where is the damn conclusion? I hate these freaking idiots that publish half a story!
I know ppl who have seizures and passed away while driving. Should ppl who have seizures be able to have a driver's license?
Is the car unlocked? I have a punch
I seriously don't understand people who just sit in the car and do nothing to save themselves??
Why is this cop taking his time instead of running to the car and helping
Why tf he asking if someones in there. The boy said his mother is in the car!
I’m glad she’s okay but how the hell….?
You can hear her when he walks up & asks twice, is someone in here?
“Is she in there? Is somebody in there?” After being told multiple times by people begging you for help, then he moved with no urgency. Come on.
Is somebody in there? Don’t you get paid 100k a year to check?
Did they get her out
If the child got out why couldn’t they get HER out?
Is someone in there??? Really bro??
"Is somebody in there?" What the hell? They don't ask this many questions after they shoot somebody, so why this many before taking action to save somebody?
Now what you all think of COPS? you like them you get help.
Who is videotaping this while this emergency is going on why aren’t they helping?
Still wanna defund the police?
Where's the racism????
Where is he?
Could that cop go any fuckin slower? Where's the sense on urgency? Like yes, you still helped but damn
Is the car unlocked ? Is it 4 wheel   drive? Moonroof or sunroof?
I hope they were able to save her in time! Did she survive? 😮
Why was he hesitant at first?😮
Just curious if they were having to use a punch how did the brave little boy get out?
Was that Liam?
Where the heck was she driving to
how in tf did she even get there😂😂
The son knows she has seizures, so why does she have a license, why is she driving, why isnt she arrested for child endangerment?
Is somebody in there? Are you armed?
Did she live?
How did the car in up in the pond???
Good samaritain cop? He asked too many questions and hesitated to start.
This a hole, is someone in there? Yess that's why the kid brought you over an why someone is still trying by the car..use your brain
Did she live?
Why do they keep giving me these propaganda videos of the police and Drake on youtube?
Don’t they carry a glass punch on their belt?
Is the little man and he's momma all right ? Thats what we wannah know. 😮😮😮
Did she do it on purpose?
He is a cop… isn’t that his job to serve and protect?
Another useless cop who thinks just their presence brings anything to the table lol he really asked “is anybody in there?” He must be scared of the water touching his knees
Why they ask if the cars unlocked…just goo 😭
How can drive in the sea?
How you mean if shes in there?
You can hear a screaming and he has to ask if someone in there?
Could he go any slower
Did anyone else think why is the cop moving SO SLOW??????
Did she live?
Why he keep asking if his mom is in the car? The boy ain’t speaking Spanish is he?
Good Samaritan? I hate when cops get labled that. They took the oath and its there career to be a public servant. Not a good Samaritan just doing what they're paid to do
How come we don’t see those short faces women cops doing this stuff? 😅😅😅😅
Why did he have to tell you more than once his mom was in there?
Did anyone else see the other video where the cop looks like a complete sociopath with no haste?
How did the boy get out? Did he shut the door after he got out?
Has that cop ever heard of urgency?
Did the cop really ask if there was somebody in there shouting at the car? Smh I mean I'm glad everything worked out in the end but damn.
idk...he was told somebody was in there but he still asking if somebody in there? thats weird
Why the hell did the cop wait so long to go in.
Can he move any slower? GEEZ
Why don't all cops carry glass breakers.
Anybody know how this resulted in the end?
Em sorry. I mean yes, good the officer helped but is that not his job?
Is the car unlocked? Really!!!!
How you get in there? Far from the main road
Is somebody in there 🤦🏾‍♂️😂
Is someone in there? Is someone in there? 😂 Because I ain’t going in no damn water unless I have to
The dramatic rescue????
Why does this look like it’s from the 90’s. Lol.
I don't necessarily think people who have seizures should be aloud to drive. That's a danger to themselves and others. And from what I understand seizures kinda happen on they own without warning?? Or am I wrong?
Yeah, but how did it happen? Like, how did she get off the road into the water?
Why do videos stop far shorter than they should?Is there some other link?People want us to click on so we can see the whole goddamn video
“Is someone in there?” Bro wym
"Is the car unlocked?" At that point it didn't matter either way. You're still going to have to break in. Smh
Could the cop be/act any slower?
Did you notice that they are white guys helping?? People is always trying to pin white against black but you don’t see things like this go viral
Why on earth is that guy just standing there asking questions when she could be dying and the boy already explained that his mother was in the car
Where are all the cop-haters now?
Who has the guts to make this video? Is that more important then rescuing?!?
Cop yells… “is somebody in there?!!” like what’s she supposed to say from underwater… yeah, I’m in here?!! Just wow. Talk about moving in slow motion 😩
Good boy brave escape but stuck leave him mom car inside? Man go help take her out, call EMT ,, man say thank boy brave,, save her.. God bless boy's mom❤❤❤
Could that cop be any slower.
How is he a Good Samaritan? He's the police. He's doing his job. That's what he get paid for
How did the kid get out?
Did she survive???
Would have been dead after all them questions
Did she survive?
How the fuck do you drive a motor vehicle into the damn pond 🤦🏾‍♂️
Why on earth was she driving with seizer disorder? Thank God she had her brave little boy with her
"Is the car unlocked?" There's a faster way to find out than asking a child. I was surprised at how slowly this cop handled the situation. You tell me a woman is drowning in a submerged car, I'm running and diving into the water and going for the door handle as fast as I possibly can.
Is somebody in there? Is wiiillllld
Did the woman survive
Could that guy move any slower?? Not the time for 50 questions. Just MOVE!!!!
Could the cop be any slower and hesitant? Literally the person is underwater.
Did the mom survive? I couldn’t imagine going through this
Does anyone know if a fund was set up to help the cost of medical bills and loss of income to support this brave hero while his mother recovers ? Bills and expenses add up quick and they may need help.
Cops annoy me. The boy was frantically telling you his mom was in the car. So èéṣe tí get to the car and ask “is there anyone in there?” What kind of asinine question is that?
Is someone in there the kid screaming my mom in there what you think this cop is not the sharpest tool in the shed 🤦🏻‍♂️
Why was the cop moving so slow doe?
“Is somebody in there?” …what kind of dumb ass question is that Officer of the Law?
Is somebody in there? Like if somebody having a seizure is going to go yeah, I’m in here drowning!!! like the kid is freaking out about his mom having a seizure go save her
Did she live?
kid: "my mom had a seziure she's stuck in the car" cop: " is she in there? is somebody in there?"  keep waisting valuable time bud👍 typical cop not believing anything until they see it smh
The dumbass cop asking “iS SumONe een thEre?” makes me cringe so hard. There was no urgency to help get that woman out. Sickening how dumb some people are
Did she make it out alive
Is the car unlocked? Where you not going to try anyway?
Defund the who?
I got angry when he asked “is there someone in there?”   And his ass was slow verses hurried moving towards the vehicle.
“Is somebody in there!?!?” Bro stfu and get yo ass in the water!!
Somebody in there ?? what a absolute stupid question to ask in such a situation 🤦are people that stupid?
Did she survive??
Can we please make it so people with known epilepsy cant have deivers liscenses this is scary
What happened to Mom, did she make it, is she ok?
Did this turn out well?
Why does the officer keep asking questions? Just save the lady.
Why is he still asking questions when that baby is telling him and screaming "my mom"
I'm so glad everyone was saved, but the officer asked, "Is somebody in there?" I instantly went 🤦🏾‍♂️
Is somebody in there ?
why would the cop Halo is somebody in there when the boy already trying to tell him that was just dumb like she's going to say yes I'm in here.
Did she made it? Does anybody know?
That cop frustrated me, asking is someone in there? WTF what do you think? Just seemed like he didn’t want to go to work today
man stupid questions like "is somebody there?" get me annoyed like,noo I just brought u to this empty  crashed car  for fun ,it's annoying
Why was he going so slow?
Cops like "whhhaattt?" Like get tf in there and help. bro asking questions like shes not drowning in a car passed out
Dumb question. Is the car unlocked?
Why didn’t he just go to the car instead asking is somebody in there 3 times little boy kept saying she’s have a seizure the mother couldn’t hear him  and took his time going in the water skin color made a difference for him  I hope everyone was saved
Is she in there? He had to ask? As is she could respond? I'm glad he helped but kid screams for help and he nonchalant walked over like I'm glad it wasn't me In that car
"is she in there?" Bruuhhh he ain't panicking for nothing
Cop didn't seem like he wanted to or is that just me?
Possibly same person that screamed defund the police.  What now? She going to sue because he touched her without consent to do so? Glad he saved her. Hopefully she comes out o.k.
Why don't they have a window breaker
Is someone in there??? My mom help her
Is the car unlocked?
He said his momma was in the car like 4 times and yet he keeps asking ???
Why did she go in the water, I don't know, but her boy clearly didn't want to go on without her.
So did the little boy jump out the car before? Or swim out the window?
Arnt you supposed to break the rear window?  And if thats not an option   the windshield?
What kind of question is, "Is she in there? Is somebody in there?" 🙄 Dumba$$, he kept telling you, "SHE'S IN THERE, SHE SUNK!" 🤨 We don't know if he saved her or not from this...🤷🏾‍♂️
that officer ask so patiently, “is anyone in there”? 😂/took his sweet time.
All the cnts who say ALL Cops Are Bad...is that really true? White cop risks his life to save black woman - not really a headline for the scum media. Good job this baby doesn't think the way you all do.
3  feet of water and the lady couldn't open the door and walk out like her son? But no she is inside panicking and waiting 15 minutes for the car to sink, some poeple just freez and no survival skills
Is she okay?
Maybe lose the camera and help?
cop: is there somebody in there?  omfg 😮
Why do I feel like he would have reacted faster if that was a little white girl
Is somebody in there? Nah dumbass, nah...
Michael and dwight?
Who Else Thought That Was Liam, From Shameless?
Why is that cop asking if the kid already told him his mom was already in the car  It seem like that cop didn’t want to get wet but did anyway to help out that kids mother
Well, is it just me or was that policeman reluctantly doing his job?
When are yall gonna learn that chargers and challengers are some of the worst handling vehicles.
If you have a seizure disorder, should you be able to drive?
Why was the cop not sprinting into the water? You see the emergency. Stop asking questions and move your feet!
Why not police officer?  Cop is a hateful term
"Is somebody in there?" When a person is fighting for his/her life. First save and later ask the question, I think that would be much better but for now good work❤ to the kid and the men out there.
I know I'm not the only one who ponders things like this...I see so many comments from people thanking God for keeping them safe and what not but if God is all knowing and has an individual life plan for each one of his children why does he have all these horrific accidents, homicides,  suicides,  etc in plan for his children??? And to make matters worse,   as a child of God, we're supposed to follow in christ footsteps and be as christ like as we can be??? I'm a follower of God but I'm good off that,  maybe that explains why our prisons are so full,  ain't no one gonna stand in front of a judge and jury claiming God told me too lol
"Is there somebody in the car?" Dude the kids scream she is in the car multiple times ffs
Is she in there is somebody in there  .. just go help 🤦🏽‍♀️
Why do they film this?
Child crying pointing saying she sunk and cop seeing submerged car asks is she in there? Is somebody in there??? 😢 Glad they helped thank God!
*Why isn't the cop moving like someone is drowning? He didn't seem to have a care in the world...*
I can't believe this a live saving ,whonare the saviors ?are they police? Fellow citizen?
is anyone in there? useless cop
How did she end up in the pond?
Could that cop move any fuckin slower damn
“Is somebody in there?”
The cops asking so many dumb questions. "Is she in there" "is anyone inside the vehicle" "is the car unlocked" What will he ask for next? "Can I see your ID?" Come on man! Have some awareness of the situation. 🤦‍♂️
Why they still recording while saving someone
The boy is screaming his mom is in there and the cop is going 'hello is somebody in there?'
EMS step it up? I've seen molasses move faster than this cop.
Wasnt in too much of a hurry, was they,??😝
She didnt look alive to me, did she get resucitated ?
Could this cop have moved any slower?
Good Samaritan? Ain't that his job doesn't he get paid to do this
One dumb question, when cops jump into the water, are they doing it with their guns? I ask myself if they even work after being wet tho
“Is there someone in there?” no we’re just playing hide and seek. 🤦🏻‍♂️
How did she end up in the drink?
I didn't think people who have seizures could drive?
..is this a joke ? 🤔
Did I C A Fish Flapping Out Of Someone Hand😂
Do these people have phones glued to them?
Was she ok?? Why won't they tell us?? At least finish the video...😡
Poor baby! Thank you officer! What happened to them?
Im just wondering was it a random seizure or does she have epilepsy and if so, was it a break through seizure? Otherwise she shouldn't have been allowed to drive, as someone with epilepsy i cant drive as ive been having seizures for over 20 years. Where im from you need to be seizure free for a year in order to drive
Why was the car in the water? Was it intentionally?
Great job, rescuers Stupid question of the day: Is the car unlocked?  ☮️🌈🤎
I thought anyone that has seizures wasn’t allowed to drive? 😮 Well raised kids tho
Get my phone?  Really these are our public servants.  I think no I demand we do better.
Shes having a seizure.  Hello is anyone in there?!? Ems step it up? Bruh doesnt even know you cant talk while having one.
Why was the police officer so hesitant? Not saying he didn’t do his job, but it’s almost like he was saying shit I don’t want to get wet uuuugggghhh now I have to get in there.
Where is tge whole video?
Good Samaritan? That’s what cops are here for. It’s crazy when a cop actually does something he’s suppose to do he’s called a Good Samaritan lmao
That cop dead didn’t want to go, asking “is somebody in there?” While the car is under water is wild
Good Samaritan cop? Or a cop doing his job?
“Is she in there?” can we please give these protect and serve people IQ tests ffs
Where's the urgency from this cop?
I hope we aren't pretending that pick pockets dont follow every single Olympic location? They are a breeding ground for thieves no matter which country it goes to
What happened to mother! She was unconcious I guess! Not clear!  Under water!
Good job on getting her out all three of you, sincerely. I have to ask am I the only one wondering why he's just casually walking like he knows she's already gone when the kids is begging him to help and he says "is there anybody in there"?
Does anyone know if she lived, or was it too late?? That's a long time to be in the water.
How did the car get in there?
How did the kid get out.  I’m Confused
How did he get out if they had to break windows.
Why is that cop taking his sweet old time at the beginning???
Is the car unlocked? What a bizarre question. “No sir I locked it while my mum had a seizure”
Why is the cop so relaxed?
....... is it just me or did he not move fast enough?
Is it just me or does it seem like the police officer showed very little urgency in this situation?
Is it just me or were they struggling with the side window when the back window was out the water and easier to break i hope everything turned out okay because every second counts
Why did the cop take so long to
How about you stop asking questions and try to save the woman!
Why doesn't this make the main stream media?!    Because it doesn't fit the agenda.
Why is he taking his time instead of just saying is she in there just listen to the kid because she can die within seconds 🏊🏃 ask questions later
Defund the police, am I right? That’s sarcasm for you lefties
taken his sweet time a bit much?  is someone in there? Is the car unlocked?
Did he do the work or the child?
Did she live?.
Why is the cop asking dumb qustions.
Why ask questions if you hear the situation 🤷
So, did she live?
Did she drown or what don't see her
Why are the cops’ body cam footage always available for stuff like this, but in other cases, they “forget” to record, or the footage gets lost? Weird how that works… It’s almost like they are a corrupt and dishonest institution.
Are there alligators in that part of TX? 😲
why was she driving
AIs this momma and family okay? 🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐💞💞💞🫂🫂🫂
Without looking him up, who can guess what this cop looks like?
Does anyone else notice that this overweight cop is moving slower than the speed of smell..... Like where is his sense of urgency?
how did this guy have time to film everything at the same time?.....filming would be the last thing on my mind in a situation like that?........
So did the cops do that girl?
Am I the only one erked by the cop's dumb questions? The boy gave more than emough info to get him going immediately!
IQ test, open the back doors or the front?
What caused her to go In the water????
Did she survive?
Did she live??
Why the camera gotta be part of the rescue?
I wonder if the cop gave her a ticket he sounds a little bit like that type
Do they allways carry under water cameras  or is this a act.
And why is she driving?
Is it just me or was the guy slow af?!
Is the car unlocked? GET IN THERE!!! FFS...
Poor little boy he was so frightened.. trying to get help for his mom.. thank you for the man that saved her.. is she okay?
Is there somebody in there lol
I wonder how the boy got out but the doors were locked/ windows shut. Or did I miss that?  Poor precious boy. That’s trauma. I hope she makes a full recovery for his sake and hers.
Why is he walking all casually  is there anybody in there, stupid
The man with the cameras asking if somebody in there? It’s like what the hell do you think the kid drove the car himself into the water asking for help for his mom? What a stupid question.
I’m still trying to figure out why this cop is questioning the situation and not getting in there…Does it seem like no one is in there?
"Is there somebody in there?" Bro are you deaf? The kid told you exactly what the situation was.
Why tf did the cop just walk there like that? No rush or urgency at all!
Is she in there? Save her. WHAT??
Did she survive?
Is somebody in there while a child cried for help STRAIGHT LAME
Could the cop be any slower asking the most redundant questions. Just get there and save the women. Elmer Fud
How was that a dramatic reaction?
Is she alive?
Why did the lazy cop stand at the edge of the water while the kid was in the water looking for his mom!!!
Am I the only one annoyed at the cop's lack of urgency?
Why did it take the officer so long to get to the car and rescue lady Little boy was there first. That's sad.
Good Samaritan my a$$ b$tch a$$ cop ain’t even wanna get in is she in there? No shit u think its a prank wtf
Did they save her?
Was she saved?  All we see is the drama unfolding.
Who is recording???
And why don’t they have the window poppers? SMH
Why the fuck would you be recording this?
Why save them?
Why is this hillbilly asking so many questions?
Is she in there? is somebody in there? Is the car unlocked? Stressed me out. Way to hustle officer smh.
How long was she under. Shes a trooper. Thank god for good people.
"Is somebody in there?" Might be the dumbest question of all time given the situation
Is someone in there wtf kinda question
Is the car unlocked is a wild question
So what did the cop do again?
Omg hello os soneone in there??? Her son said help his mom shes stuck in the water
why do people drive knowing damn well they have seizures very selfish
What was the outcome I hate these quick little drastic issues that never give us the outcome I pray she made it poor child did everything he could
Did she survive?
What did the officer do😮
Is that Florida
How did she get in there?!
I knew about the swimming, but the driving to?
Any word on his mom?
This fucking cop asking “is she in there?” Bro, what?
Is that the kid from shameless ?
Is the car unlocked?
What a dumb cop. Hears the boy screaming his momma is having a seizure and she sunk...gets to the cop then proceeds to start asking "is there somebody in the car?" Can't stand stupid people, especially stupid cops.
So nobody sees the cops lack of sense of urgency as a problem, and the fact that he wasted time standing there asking a dumb question... "Is somebody in there?" Clearly the driver seat is submerged in the water, how would anybody respond?? Then the boy is clearly fresh out the water and trying to get you to hurry up and save her, he already told you she was in there!
How are you gonna stand there wasting time asking if someone is in there while the car is under water?  Get in there and save her the boy told you she was in there.
The cop was asking some really lame questions… is somebody in there?? Really?
Why yell is someone in there if she is drowning I don't think she could answer?
Why was he filming though?  I wouldn't think to film someone having a life or death crisis...I'd just help.
What is a punch?
Was she rescued in time, I fear that she wasn’t 😬? That poor lad witnessing it all, so traumatic for him x
Did he ask the boy if the car was unlocked?
Who DF is filming
I don’t feel the cop cared enough 😢 why keep asking if there’s someone in the car AFTER the boy crying telling you his mom is in the car??? That’s seconds taken from her life😢
So whats the outcome???
I'm thankful she was rescued and her son made it out of the car.  That alone is a miracle.  Was this her 1st seizure?  Please don't risk driving if you have a history of seizures.  You can't be replaced.
Is the car unlocked... Really??!!;/
Was that Liam?
Is the car unlocked? 😂 wtf
Why was he asking so many questions?
I hope she’s okay! 😮 Any updated?
But why drive when you know you normally have seizures? What's the point.
Is the momma ok? I am crying and praying. Is she ok?
When the cop walked up to the water mad slow standing there asking if somebody was in the car while the kid was literally screaming.........like cmon bro tf you doin
Dude the kid said his mom was in there and youre standing there saying is she in there? Is somebody in there? No, no ones in there thats why that terrified child is there panicking crying telling you she's in there
Could the cop have moved any slower? This is the moment most cops (when they're children) wait their entire lives for to be the hero and save someone. This cop lolligagging around taking his sweet ass time. Thank god for that civillian was acting fast
Cop asks questions instead of taking action immediately,  what the f?
What is de cop doing on the other side of the care while the other man in the water tries to save her?
Is she in there? Like wtf do you think this is officer smh
What an idiot. He just stands around and asks questions. "Is she in there? Is somebody in there? Is the car unlocked?" THE KID IS DESPERATELY TELLING YOU THAT SHE IS. GOOD GRIEF.
Is there somebody in there? What did lil man tell you !
Why did the first cop have zero sense of urgency?
Are you seriously videoing this when that lady is drowning
U mean theses tyrants don’t just shoot people?
weird. did she let the kid out of the car before she drove into that lake?
My heart is breaking!! Did she survive?
"is somebody in there?" As multiple ppl are screaming for your help 🥴 just take your time there, buddy
Could he take any longer.
Why tf didn’t he rush in…?  Ain’t no reason to be so hesitant to approach… Yeah, could be an instance of drug use, but the kid indicated she has a history of seizures. Not to mention… even if she was on drugs, it’s better to have a black eye and scratches than see a woman lose her whole damn life.
DAMNIT!!!.... Did momma live or not!? Please say she did!!
Good Samaritan? He was casually strolling to ..do his job.
How in the world do people with a seizure disorder get a driver's license
What happened with her. She make it?? The poor boy
How did the kid get out,or did this happen close to where the kid was & saw it happen,anyway glad to read it ended okay. ✌
Why is he so sloww ?
Anyone else got frustrated because he wasn't acting quick enough??
She is underwater and he asked if anyone is in there? She gonna scream yes?
His ass asking questions instead of moving quickly!!! If a panicked child told you she sunk, why are you asking questions??
Is she in there? Is somebody in there? Seriously??? 🤦🏿🤦🏿 I just can't. Thank God there were other people around. Reading the comments makes me happy knowing she and her son will see better days 💕🙏🏿
What's with the thousand questions before helping? She's drowning!
How did the boy get out? He's a smart and brave kid. ❤
Yelling “is somebody in there”? Do you think that baby is lying? And do you expect to hear her yelling under water or that she can hear you?
Is she in there? He's taking his sweet ass time
Why is the cop asking is someone in the car when the child already told him??? Just save her 😮😮😮
'Is she in there?!' Dude, that young man TOLD YOU she was..  and why is the cop holding the camera?
Did he drop her in the end back in the water WTF???
Is she dead?
Is it just me or was this cop " dragging" his feet? I watched and felt like he was moving in slow motion in the beginning.
Is there no regulations on issuing a driver's license to people that are at risk of seizures?
Is anybody in there?  C'mon man
Why is no one talking about the indifferent, lethargic response of the officer. You'd think he was stepping into the hotel swimming pool when the water was a little cold. No urgency whatsoever 😡
If she’s drowning how she suppose to answer ?!? he was suppose to jump in the water…too slow to my liking.  I mean he was calm which was excellent but I didn’t sense the urgency on his reaction
Why are people so incompetent smh
How come they had time to record this
So did the boy lock the doors when he got out?
Why ask him more than once ??
Why u jus standing there asking if she's in there when that Lil kid jus told u she was in there... wtf dude. Pick up the pase like could u move any slower dude
Is she in there?? Really ??? Come on you don’t question you act right away .. good this the person is ok,
Is this cop ok asking if the car is unlocked
What kind of idiot keep asking if she is in there don’t he see the situation and the boy just told you she is in the car and that was the slowest I seen someone go in to help like if he was scared of the water jump in to action man
What a dumb question is anyone in there BOI SHE WAS SCREAMING SO LOUD MATE
why is he yelling is someone in there?  the little boy had to say help her?
Is somebody in there? No response? Aight imma head out.
Is somebody in there?  No it just drove it's self
How's she operating a vehicle when she has seizure?
Why tf did he hesitate to go in the water and ask if someone was in there after the kid already told him what happened?!?
Is the car unlocked?   . . . . . Do you want me to get you a key cut . . Hang on I've just got a phone call . . 😊.
Who's recording this and why?
I'm sorry but the kid told him before they arrived what was going on and then he gets there and keeps yelling 'Is SoMeBoDy iN tHeRe?? 🥴'
Is this Florida?? Cuz MURKY WATER + LILY PADS = GATORS!!!!!! Sorry kid 🏃‍♂️ J/K!!! She's actually OK.  Thank God!!
IS THAT NOT HIS JOB TO HELP?????
Why was the police officer asking if anyone was in the car after the child frantically told him she’s having a seizure she’s in the car she’s in the water?
Is he really asking is someone in their the kid told you his momma was in their 😢
Why was the cop not acting with urgency? Yeah he helped, but hewas pretty relaxed even when he saw the car literally half way in, and asking,"is she in there? Is somebody here?" Come on.
Why is he asking if someone is in there when the boy already told him his mom was in there?
How’s his mom??? ❤
Why are you asking if someone is in there when this boy JUST told you his mom was in there 😡 Very unnecessary
Is somebody in there???...wth ..go see
how did he know she was having a seizure? she must have a history of it.
If she was having a seizure, as in epileptic seizure, why is she driving?? Awful accident.
Why would you record this and not just save her lol
Couldn't tell if she was ok. Can someone reply and let us know?
My heart goes out to little man....great job young fella along with the cop and the man that was already in the water...but my question does she have a history of seizures ?? If yes why is she still driving?? Just a question
Is somebody in there????  Thanks to the other  person   this Mother is alive!
If ses having a seizure why foes she have a drivers license ? In sweden you cant have a license if you have certain health issues
Is somebody in there?-  if you’re underwater and having a seizure could you tap once- tap twice if the child is exaggerating because I’m pretty sure that’s why I move in slow motion?
How she got in there??😢
How is she doing?! Amen to the kid who was able to get out and get help. Prayers!!!
Why tf is he moving super slow? He didnt call no for a ambulance it took that lil boy screaming at him to help her for him to go in that water
WTF you mean,"Is somebody in there?". He already told you she was. Then he asked is the car unlocked. STUPID QUESTIONS BUDDY!! But thank GOD he got her out in time to save her.
Did she live?
Oh man, that poor kid, is somebody in there? YES, THE KIDS MUM LIKE HE JUST TOLD YOU😮
Hello, are you ok?  Are you in there? Do you have your id and insurance?  Mamm you can't park there
Why is the cop being so slow about it when the child is screaming to help her? I’m happy she was saved but that dude had me upset
So he told kid get in let’s go down there in beginning of vidio ,,,, how far did kid run to get help finally or how many people seen this and figured not going stop cause didn’t want be late for work or soccor practice or didn’t want get stuck in traffic????
Can she NOT drive from now on—-just to be on the safe side😢❤❤
Why would ask is somebody in there
Why the police was so slow and also repeatedly asked "she is there? Somebody is there" ...why didn't react immediately? Damn, there is NO time to lose in that questions
Still want to defund the police?
How did he get out, couldnt they have gotten in that way?😮
How did she even end up in there@?? And did her son crawl out the window!!??? ❤ 😢
What was it the one man handed to the other guy?
Why was he asking if someone was in there when the kid just told him the details?
" is there somebody in there? .... I mean.... there's this kid in a panic...... but I don't want to get wet...... is there anybody in there? "  Take your time, officer nice guy..... she ain't  going anywhere.
did the cop want her to die why would he be so slow to help
Kid is telling the cop to help his mom in the car and he was like is somebody there? and hesitating to look for someone to help!😢
Why did Momma launch that car into a body of water? That isn’t the kind of thing that happens often.
What do we pay cops for?  Seems to be in no rush.
are you telling the truth black kid? Are you sure? I still don't believe you well okay, let me see but I'm going to take my time just in case.
Why is she driving knowing she has  seizures
Was that a damn fish??
Anything known how they are doing?
Why do cops ask such stupid ass questions
I wonder if it was the cops wife or child would he have been taking his sweet time like he was in this situation
Did she make it. OMG that poor child❤
Damn, could the Cop have moved any slower? 😢
What are we looking at…. ?
Why no description??? Hate when you do this,,, 🥵🥵🥵😞😞😞😞😞😞
Why is the cop taking so slow
Did he escapee the car?
Is someone in there? What do you think he stopped you for?
Ok. Maybe we'd all like to know how the car ended up in the water in the first place? Just asking!
A woman driver?  Why am I not surprised?
Is the car unlocked? As he slowly walks into the water. Wow.
The guy asking is somebody in there annoyed me bad!! He expected a response from someone who was drowning!? 🙄
Is somebody in there? Like wtf u think the little boy ran to you for
Is anyone in there ? Cop actually asked after kid frantically says someone stuck
The child knows what a seizure is. This makes me wonder why the mother was driving at all if she has a history of seizures(?). Lucky they are alright now.
“Is she in there….. is somebody in there?”   The son BEEN SCREAMING THAT HIS MOM IS IN THERE I feel like this cop took too much time, every half second matters when you’re under water!!!
What kind of dumb ass question is that ?Boy says my mother's in there, Officer says is somebody in there.(Repeatedly)ughhhhhh..
You can hear that poor woman screaming and still asking if there's somebody in there? Are you freaking serious right now??????????
“Is she in there? Is somebody in there?”After a frantic WET boy just told you she in the water.  🤦🏾‍♀️
Awe… I feel so badly for that Child. Was the Mother alright? ♥️♥️♥️
Why the cop so damn slow
Why is the cop so slow and calm, and asking all those questions. Just get in the water and save her.
Amazing kid. Amazing cop. Does anyone know the outcome?? I hate these nonclosure videos
Do anybody one knows his name the officer?❤
Did she survive?
is somebody's in there ? really taking your sweet little time while they could die is not a hero .
Sorry but cops asking if she In there when lil boys already Told cop his Mamas In the car!!?? Plus lil boys all Wet, frantic, etc .....Cops moving Real Slow like he dont wanna get wet or Save A LIFE!!!💔
What an idiot! Is someone in there? Did this idiot cop think the mom was going to pop her head up and say, "yeah!, I'm in here!"
I'm confused - not saying my mama and she's in water but coo asking if anyone in there. Where's the running to the car? Seconds count.
Is that the kid back in the water
did his mom live??????
Is the car unlocked? Wow
Can that person be any slower asking if anyone is in there when that poor baby is crying pointing saying momma. Dear God
where are the cop haters????
Did she survive?
WHO WAS FILMING THE WHOLE THING??
Is she drowning?
Is it just me or was the cop just taking his sweet time?? Was he telling the child to break the window?? And if so isn’t that his job??
What's the outcome? Did she make it ⁉️ Thank you to all that Responded
Is somebody in there? Is the door unlocked... stupid questions to ask seconds are ticking away Yes, his mom was driving the car, so obviously (kid even said it when he said hurry help), and im sure the kid double-checked to make sure the doors were unlocked before they crashed!!!
Oh that poor baby! That broke my heart, and then the guy actually asked ”is somebody in there”? Are you effing kidding me? Well, at least he got her out! 🤍🤍
He did not seem like it was too urgent. I hope she made it. Boy, what luck for that kid though, that cop must have been driving by. Or maybe her head was above water, and he called 911? So many questions
Is somebody in there. Is wild, good video
Is she ok??? Tell me these babies didn't just loose their mama
Is the mother ok??! I pray that she is!! Her son is her Angel!!!💖💖💖🙏🙏🙏
What ended up happening???
Can someone explain, why did he have to put the kid in back of the patrol car?? 🤔🤔
But did she actually survive? She didn’t look conscious to me
How did he get out, the kid??
IS SHE IN THERE? IS SOMEBODY IN THERE? My man, the child JUST TOLD you she’s in there, just get to saving her. Damn.
I wonder if she supports defunding the police now?
why was the cop moving so slow in the beginning
Is someone in there......wow
Does anyone know if she is still alive? This is so sad!!!
Was that a baby kid they were carrying out weres the mom
Was he also inside? How did he know?
Since when is a cop saving a drowning women a Good Samaritan? He's just a dude doing his job people.
We’re just going to ignore the lackadaisical nonchalant behavior and rhetorical questions of the “cop”…? THANK GOODNESS a Good Samaritan was there the cop was doing nothing!
What a stupid ass question
I don’t get it?! The child said “she’s having a seizure, she’s sunk, please help her” and your response is “is she in there, is anyone in there”? Time wasted because you already have the answers
Is the car unlocked? WHAT?????
Is the car unlocked??!?! wtf, yea, that’s what that scared little boy is thinking of/remembering if it is or not as the cop strolls on down to help. . .
Was the car stolen?
Why is he asking is somebody in there. The child took you there for a reason. The person was having a seizure 😑 Smh he was ready to let that lady die. Thank god he had a change of heart. 💯
So grateful they were able to save his mom! Did anybody see this story on the news? A white cop saving a black woman… hmmm
They got there in time though right? shorts don't normally show the end or do we have like a whole video that we can link please?
Update?  Bless his heart 😢
Do any car makers equip cars with a window breaker? 🤔
Why did the officer take so long to jump into the water?
Was she alive?!
Why in the fuck did he wait so fucking long ?
Where does it say she was saved? Does anyone know for sure?
Did she make it? Lord, have mercy.😢
How many times does this distraught child have to tell this cop his mother is actively dying before he shows any sense of urgency?
Is it me or the cop was way to clam and slow in a situation where someone could be drowning inside a car but his whole energy changed when there was a good Samaritan trying to help.
Is somebody in there? Did I hear that? 👂🏼 bruh what’s the point of that kid calling him for?
Is she in there? Well what do you think.
Good on the cop but half of America hates cops so...? I hope this kid remembers a cop saved his mom's life and will respect the blue instead of hating those who just want to help save people. The kid is very brave, good on his sweet soul.
How did he got out
Sooooo it didn't show how he saved her or if she is ok?
How was the kid doing more than the officer?
Oh my Jesus! Did they get her out in time??
Did she live?
Did she make it? Where is the rest of the story?
Why was he moving so slow, bro? I would’ve been diving in. What the hell
Can you ask more questions…before you actually help.  🙄
Omg! Is she ok?? That poor kid...I hope his mom is fine.
Is she ok?
Why is the officer show to respond?
Does anyone know if she is ok? What a brave and wonderful son? 🙏
Is she in there? Is anyone in there is the questions this cop asked after the young man told him she was in there and having a seizure. I didn’t see any urgency from this cop non what’s so ever. I don’t know if the mom made it out but GOD bless the young man because he’s the true hero.
How old is Mama be okay
What happened to running and diving into the water to save a damsel in distress? He was strolling asking dumb ass questions.
Is this lady has seizures she should not be driving
Sooo a soak and wet child ask a cop for help, and the police get to the emergency, and ask before getting in the water “is anybody in there”? 😮 sooo you can’t put 2and2 together 😢
Could this asshole cop move any slower.
Is somebody in there? Yea dummy he told you!!!  Like hurry up tf!?🤬 Poor baby, hope both are well❤️‍🩹
“Is she in there?, is the car unlocked?” Are you Fuckin kidding dude? Jump in and find out
Did she live!!??😢
Did his momma live
Did She survive???
So what happened?
What a stupid question 🙄   yes! She's in there.  She's stuck...he told you!!! Get her out now!
Nahhĥ bruh.....the question is why is she in there ?
How is she ❤️
Why drive when you know you have such a health condition?
Is somebody in there? 🤦🏾‍♂️
She's having a seizure, cars upside down and underwater  Cop: is somebody in there? 🥴
Is she in there? Is car unlocked? Hey how much gas did she have in the tank? Why aren't you in school? Did she drive in the water on purpose? How old is she? Does she got any id on her?
Was it a rescue? That child broke my heart. 😢 I felt every bit of his plea.
Could the cop have moved ANY slower?
Just take your time! Fyi? People under water cannot answer when you ask "anyone in der"! Just stupidity in Action!
Why does this cop make stupid questions?
OMG, does a seizure have a prior indicator? 😢 The cop got wet diving under water are they trained for such?
Take your time! No rush! "Is the door locked?"
Is making so much effort to get her out no sense of urgency
How could speak if she's under water and having a seizure? He kept asking is anyone in there...
COPS SO SLOW AND ASKING IF SOMEONE IN THERE THAT POOR CHILD JUST TOLD HIM HIS MOM IN THERE. WHAT HAPPENED DID SHE MAKE IT? SLOW RESPONSE 😞
How????? What happened??
why does the video stop short?
Why was the cop moving so slow
"is she in there...?" Well obviously guy this young boy just came to you or anyone he could find then ran into water yelling mom at the car....id say his mom is in there like he told u
I thought people with seizures shouldn't drive?I hope she is ok😢
How in heck they get in themat water
Why ask the kid questions like that? Are the doors locked is she in their. Dipshit cop
Did the mom make it?
I wonder could they have popped the trunk?
So my question.... why are ppl allowed to drive when they randomly get seizures??I'm not saying they shouldn't but there should atleast be another licensed driver with her at all times or a grown person... in sa we allowed to drive with learners in  the block only but when going on the road u need a licensed driver present doesn't have to be behind the wheel but he must be present..until u pass out ur license ...
Why did he keep asking if someone was in the car when the little boy is crying telling him his mom is in there
How restarded is that cop? The kids telling you she's in there but you stand there with your thumb up your ass, he didn't save anyone. That guy did all the work.
What an idiot police why would you ask if someone in car when the kid is crying in already telling you his mom is in the car needed to be rescued
Was she saved?  She was under a while??🙏
" Is something in there?" 🙄 whatta mean sir ?  He just told desperately his mama is in there 🤨 I swear I always get a few gray hair with these police and 911 oparators delayed reactions.
"Is she in there? Is somebody in there!?" GO CHECK MF!! 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ dont just keep asking the kid!
Omg he broke my heart. Was she ok after the rescue? Praying she’s ok.
When are they going to make cars that don’t sink?
Did his mom survive it doesn't show pray that she  Survive
As the cop struts over without urgency asking “are you in there?”.  However, glad she made it out.
is the car unlocked!! what type of question to ask that child
Is that the same kid from Shameless 😮
Why does this officer lack urgency?
Did she live?  I really hope she's okay
These clips never give enough info! Did the cop get her out or the EMS? How is she now,? Were there any lasting physical affects?
Is she ok?
Does anyone know what happened to her and her son? I’m hoping she made it and has recovered!
Why tf was she’s driving especially with her son in the car if she has seizures 😒
Answer this? They can never swim !!!  Why is that?
Why did he ask if somebody is in there when the child told him? The lack of urgency is weird ... idgf what happened in the end the people onsight seems to be more of service
Any updates on how the mom is?
How did the Momcome out?
Why is he taking his sweet ass time
is there somebody in the car like he was lying,,,,,
Is the mom ok ❤❤son did he’s part praying for them
Does anyone know if this Mummy is okay? Her little boy is a hero. What a brilliant young man. Bless him. ❤
Does anyone have am update? Did the mom make it?💥🙏💥
How did she end up in a lake 😮
Is she in there?  No im just a panicked kids running down the street screaming “she’s having a seizure” and “she’s in the water “ and pointing frantically at the car!!  Seconds matter.  Thank you for saving her life…. But really?
If shes prone to seizures, why is she driving in the first place? Lucky the son made it out too.
Could that cop move any slower? Is she in there? Really?!?! What a loser
Did she survive? Omg that poor child
Is his mother Ok? This is awful.
Is the car unlocked? Guess fkn what, go and check!! What on earth is going on in thats cop brain...brain on holiday?
How was she supposed to hear him calling? Hmm She is under the water sir.
Is she in there? What a slow ass question ?
How does this woman have a driver's license
Why is he asking is there some in there the kid just told him tht shit
“Is somebody in there??” x2  *BRO YOU HAVE A PANICKED CHILD TELLING YOU THERE IS* dive tf in! WTH
Is the car unlocked bro stfu and figure out
Oh my god I feel so bad for that young boy.   I hope his mother is okay. Does anyone know how this turned out?
I wonder how the boy got out!
Could that cop have moved any slower?
Did that cop piss anybody else off
Can we get an update on the mom?
Could that cop move any slower
So how did the kid get out ? All doors and windows were shut. 🤔
Why keep asking is she in there ? The boy made me cry 💔 my heart goes out to him
Does anyone know if she's okay???
I want to know if she had a history of seizures?
People with seizures probably shouldn’t be driving.  Was she ok?
I'm sorry, but was it me or was he moving like he had no place to go?When there's an emergency, move your backside like you got someplace to go 😢
Did the boys mother survive,  does anyone know.
Is momma okay ❤🙏🙏🤗 protect this lil one and his mommav😢
How the hell she drove in there
Why is he moving so slow
Cop what Do  you mean? if she's in there, if somebody is in there ?
Why in the world does he keep asking if somebody's in there?? The child is begging him to save is mama! 😢
I don't understand why the cop was standing there asking questions before immediately reacting! Suppose the person couldn't holler out so that means he wouldn't have gone in? His response was too damn slow for me after a kid is standing there telling you there's a car submerged and then you get there and you're still questioning it which means he didn't quite believe him!
How the hell does someone whip out a phone to record in a huge emergency.
Thank god for the good Samaritans, the cop is too busy asking questions, is she in there? Is the car unlocked? U know she is in there bro, come on!!!
Please post how to rescue someone in such a situation: how do you get them out, how to prevent from drowning yourself?
Lord!!! How is she doing? Does anyone know? Thank you for all who helped her.
What's fucked up is? They'll pull that gun and shoot when their life's in danger But if somebody else's life is in danger, they won't pull that gun and shoot out the window. They'll sit there and tap on the window with a rock. Thinking that Little Rock's gonna break the window. Right, no, it didn't.
Is the door unlocked??
Is this cop special ed?
Is she ok😢,, please let her be ok for him, he loves her so much..
If you saw a crocodile 🐊   or alligators 🐊 in distance: would you still have the same eager to help?? 🤔
Could he be any  slower
Why did  he ask is somebody in there? He took and you "trained officer" Why would did he ask "is the door unlocked?" GO FIND OUT INSTEAD OF ASKING STUPID QUESTIONS!.
Oh God! Is she ok???
Is she ok??
Why will someone with seizures drive. This is very dangerous
Wasting time by asking stupid questions? The boy is scared to death and in shock! What more do you need? 🙄
My question is how the hell did that car end up in the water ??? 😮 Bravo to the child and the first responders who saved her life. 😇🪖🫂🗣️👋❤️‍🩹😎💯👻👾👼😘🚨💯
⚠️STILL, NOT ONE PIECE OF INFORMATION STATING WHETHER OR NOT THE WOMAN SURVIVED?!?! 🧐
Is somebody in there? 🤔
I wonder if that was her first ever seizure?  If you have a history of them, then it's very dangerous to drive at all.
why didn't that police officer go into the water right away, afraid of wet socks, ridiculous, every second counts
I guess that cop just didn't want to get wet??.. how many times does someone have too be told directly that theres someone in the car before he stops asking if theres someone in there??!!thank god for the good Samaritan
I'm wondering why she's allowed to drive if she has seizures?
How did the young man get out of the car?😢
Why does he ask if someone is in there when the boy just told him his mom's in there. N why does he walk up, then stand at the bank asking questions. U can tell he was doubting on weather or not to get in there.
Did his mother live??????😢
Why the hell would she drive a car if she has seizures? You can’t even get a driver’s license. It wasn’t her first because the kid knew exactly what was wrong with her.
😢 Why are they moving so slow to rescue her??
Why the cop moving slow af....then he wanna pick up speed when he see a man in the water helping
Who asks chilled questions like these when a child who is soaking wet just told you in hysteria that my mom is in there? Then you even have time to shoot a video🙄 Thanks but no thanks😮
Does anyone know if the baby made it?
"Is she in there, is someone in there?" .... i mean he TOLD YOU his mom is in the damn car!?
How did she make out!!! Anyone know? I’m scared for mom and son😢😢❤❤
Question:  what's hoe?  It used to be that it was a woman who was sexually active with multiple men at once on a casual basis.  But what is a hoe now-a-days?  I feel a woman's "body count" is nobody's business especially if she's been in relationships.
Why do people post these life and death situations and not give the full story! Don’t post things you can’t corroborate!
Why is she even driving thats against police and doctor orders
Where is the Police
Did she survive?
How do you accidentally drive into a lake?
How did the boy get out
Did this mother survive for God sakes?
How did she get in there ???????
"Is she in there?" The dangon child just pointed & said she was having a seizure. Sheesh!!
Thank God they were able to get her out. Any updates? That’s so scary for him and us watching. 😩
How did they get there in the first place 😳!?
Happy to hear Mom is slowly getting better. 🙏🙏 How did the car get in that water?
I live in west orange.  What body of water is this.? I need a back story. 😮
Did she survive
How could she not see the lake?  I get it that someone with a truck could have pushed her in the lake. There are a lot of trucks in Texas being driven by big ego'd texans. I supposed she could have fallen asleep or texting, but you have a lake in front of you.
How did he know she was having a seizure? If she has them I wonder why she’s driving 😢
Why is he asking if somebody’s in there when they’re supposedly sunk
“Is someone in there?” 🤔 Glad your humanity stepped in!
Brave kid! That officer was asking too many questions. Is the car unlocked?? I saw a comment that she was in recovery ❤
It's only a question...Should people who knowingly have been diagnosed with "Seizures" be on the road driving? Should she have had a trained dog in there with her at all times? How can we prevent something like this from happening again? Is there any real help or education for persons with seizures who have no other choice of getting around but driving? People with this diagnosis have a very hard time getting on "Disability" despite medical diagnosis. What's your opinion or factual knowledge?
He’s asking is somebody in there? I mean is the car going to drive itself. So the kid just appeared out of nowhere.
How dumb was this cop to see a car turned over & a kid clearly telling you what’s going on… & the cop still asks if anyone is in there!? WTF!!!?
Could the cop move any slower and care any less? Bet if ut was a white kid he would've moved 100xs faster.
Should people who have seizure disorders be driving??!
Did she live?
cop:Is somebody in there ???
"Is somebody in there"? Jump in and find out rain man.
Question number one: how does he know it’s a seizure? Number two: if mom has seizures often what is she doing behind the wheel?
Is there a positive update on this lady? Bless little man fir asking for help! X
If she has seizures what is she doing driving?!! And apparently it's not the first time because that child KNEW what was happening. SMH.
"is she in there?" Naw we just out here pryin open submerged doors for fun. Tf u think?
Is she okay? ❤
Any links for the whole thing? Any updates??
😢Is she ok does anyone know? ❤❤❤❤😢
Is the mom ok?
Do cops have a tool that breaks down windows in case of an emergency?
Is the case unlocked? I'm confused... why did he ask that?
Is the car unlocked?
Did she survive
Why would any adult drive child when they have seizures?
Why was the cop not running into the water....geez these public servants I swear
I wonder does she have a history of seizures, if so, she may have been abandoned from driving. Feel sorry for this family 😢🙏🏾
So the cop was asking (after the boy told him) Is somebody in there?
Is the car unlocked 🙄. Asking dumb questions. I hope she's ok and bless them for at least tryin
Why it looks like he's moving in slow motion 😮😮
Why first responders don't have a window punch is beyond me.
Is the in there? Is the car unlocked? What a coward..  Jump in ask questions later
Why was dude so slow......
"Is somebody in there?" He already told you his mom was in there... just take ur time......wtf
How patiently does this policeman ask if there is anyone in the car when the child had already told him!! This kind of people make me sick!
My heart breaks for the boy.  Why was the woman driving if she's prone to seizures? Her children's lives are at risk!
Is somebody in there?? Dude seriously you expecting her to swin out n say yeah I'm here?? The kid said she was in the water.
What did he mean? Is there somebody in there? The little boy told him somebody was in there he needs to move faster, but thank God he helped her.
Could he of acted any slower..
Asking all these questions is somebody in there? Is somebody in it? He already told you that get them out. Help him
Is anyone in there?!! Let me see your hands, don’t reach, don’t move, show me your id
Who the hell gave her the keys?! I swear women can’t drive anything.
Why was he so hesitant to go in the water? Why are u gonna ask if she is in there your wasting time in she is was unconscious and can't respond
What happened? Was she saved?
Those are good cops,did the lady survive ???????
Why did the cop take so long to go down there and help her?
Hero Young Man!  What happened to his mom, was she okay?
Is she okay?!
Can he move like he thought a white woman was in there 😡😡
How slow is the cop?
What is he asking stupid questions for, wasting precious time
I mean, good on the cop but Jesus….could he have moved any effing slower?
Could he waddle any slower? Damn
