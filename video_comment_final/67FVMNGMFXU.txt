Whose here after Necros?
Can we get 4 player team up back in comp platinum and higher?
Did anyone notice the mark on angelas head at 1:17? That might be part of dare devils base kit.
cross progression when? i just wanted my battle pass skins from s0-s3 on my console to my pc
Is it coming out on Xbox?
May I ask if it will be available on consoles? And if yes on wich ones?
is anyone missing their season 3 and 3.5 ranked rewards? I didn't get mine and one of my friends in GM didn't either. wonder if its a bug 🤔
What Are They even fighting for 😭🙏🙏
So looks like one of Daredevil’s abilities is to blind opponents?
I'm not familiar with Angela, could someone explain why she only has one wing?
Vro when was lawyers able to do ts???😭
Anyone else get Asura's Wrath vibes from DD's animations?
New status effect?? 1:16  there is a hand eye logo above her head and she was blind
Is Daredevil the bad guy in this? Angela in the comics is arguably an anti-hero, but in Rivals she is defending K'un-Lun to protect her infant sister. Why is Daredevil attacking the city?
Anyone else notice the little Red hand appear above Angelo after he finished screaming LDO? I wonder how that plays into the game
Was that Alex Le again!?!?
Marvel is very much capable of this level of animation for a show but choose  not to why????
Umm since when is Dardevil magic? 😂 Whatever this is awesome!
Isn’t the devil a false angel tho?
What was the mark above Angela’s head
hows the gameplay? is my screen just gonna be black coz hes blind
Do i have to fight Gna again?
What is this version of daredevil?? And will we be getting him in the game? I would love to play me some daredevil

Blind Lawyer vs Goddess?   The rivalries are marvellous.
is the "let the devil out" a reference to the netflix show or was that a common line in the comics?
when Captain Marvel?
So am I the only one who noticed the PS4 logo?
1:14 Did he just inflict a debuff on her in the trailer? She's got a hand symbol on her head.
1:15 Is that the "Curse of the Hand" above her head?
Dragon??? Wheres Shang-chi at?
what is this dragon ball ahhhh fight, DID DAREDEVIL JUST GO SUPER SAIYAN 😭
So am I the only one who gonna be Lording DD on day 1 ? Because I’m beyond ecstatic that my guy DD is on the game
Where xbox one?
So why haven't your animators been hired to make a series yet?
Is Murdock the villian of S4 with “The Beast” possessing him?
I really liked the animation and the characters chosen but Why on ps4 Now ? It's just a question
Who tf is that, that aint daredevil from hells kitchen bro wth
Can we bring back 6 and 4 stacks for competitive matchmaking? So many people are leaving because they can’t play with their friends and it’s a team oriented multiplayer hero shooter. Makes no sense to only have duo queue in upper ranks, also the comm bans are insane. You can’t use any curse words at all, season 0 and 1 were so good but now the games got 90% less players, clearly the changes aren’t all good
Finally, a TANK! And another....duelist...Seriously?
How is no one talking about the crazy animation?
Anyone else notice the hand symbol above Angela’s head at 1:14? Think that happen when marked by daredevils ult?
Question is Daredevil possessed because I noticed that he smiled? 1:07
Guys why did they add Diddy to marvel rivals cuz like hes like dd? yknow ? GE-
I wonder if the hand symbol above angela that apapeared after 1:14 is only after daredevil used his ult or is it because he can detect her like Punisher's passive ability.
Why did this animation make me wanna read all of DD's comics now dawg ? 😭💔🥀
which one is coming out first?
Why is daredevil fighting an Asgardian with real power ? He’d get his ass whopper irl
What is this muscle woman?
Angela?...nah, that's rhea ripley in armor
So Daredevil is suddenly a demonic nine tail jinchuriki energy projecting superpowered individual? Devs are overreaching with these powersets, Daredevil is basically just a blind acrobat.
Is that black myth? 😂
Is Daredevil's VA the same as MKX Scorpion???
Why is Angela buffer than standard she hulk?  She's the assassin of asgard, not the roid rager of asgard.
Who's daredevil voice actor? He sounds cool
Is that a comic daredevil? I ain’t remember him having powers like that?
When is cross progression being implemented?
Who hurt bro?
Is it just me or are the maps bleak and not like as cool as how the characters look
Who even is Angela? I have no idea but she looks cool & has 8-pack abs.
Is that Aleks Le?
how tf does dare devil have godly abilities isnt he just a blind batman like detective roaming around in nyc ?
Did we just get a flying tank and another dps?

What are they feeding the Lawyers in NYC? 🙏😭
Why is Daredevil fighting a Spawn character 😂.
Is that a ps4 logo I see there? 💀💀💀
Hi, I have a question. I hope someone can answer. I arrived about a month ago in Season 3, and I'm reading that with the Deluxe Pass, I can unlock rewards from previous seasons. Is that true? Can I access Seasons 1 and 2 and unlock things even though I arrived in Season 3?
Was that Angela from spawn ? Cause same weapon and look
WTF did I just watch? Daredevil is now a dragon?
who voices daredevil??
Is... is Daredevil playing heel in this?!
Where are the supports?
1:14 Is that Daredevil's ultimate? Does he blind enemies? I can see some kind of 'hand mark' on Angela's face
Is this Daredevil even Matt Murdock or is it another Daredevil?
" _Dad, why was my sister named Rose?_ " " _Because your Mother loved roses Son._ " " _Thanks Dad._ " " _No problem _*_Season 4: The Heart of the Dragon Official Trailer | Clashes unfold Sept 12, 2025 | Marvel Rivals._* "
Are they really gonna add marvel rivals too the ps4?
is this daredevil possibly from psylockes universe bc he seems like he has powers and his design looks samurai-like
Anyone else notice when Daredevil lets the Devil out. Angela has a hand with eye icon above her head! Does that mean Daredevil can track people with his ult? Or it's a passive?
Is that Aleks Le voicing Daredevil? It kinda sounds like him.
why does this game have to be sooooooo chinese???
Is Dare Devils VA also Sung Jin Woo?!
IS THAT VALKYRIE ?
Can't chinese companies stop with forced cultural thing on IP that has nothing to do with it ?
Is that Patrick Steitz voicing Daredevil?? Hard to tell but when Daredevil screams "OUT!", it sounds just like Scorpion from Mortal Kombat.
Are we sure he’s a street tier?
Um why is this so good? 😂😂😂
Can't they talk it over, like civilized folk?
who the hell is dIANG???
Where is DEADPOOL bro
Did foggy get life, red? - punisher
Can the game come to the Switch 2?
Since when can Daredevil summon a dragon?
Any spawn fans out there hyped for angela ??
I wonder how Angela's interactions will be with her brothers Thor and Loki and her niece Hela
i wonder if they could get away with giving daredevil a kamen rider hibiki skin
is it me or daredevil looks like akira from devilman crybaby when he says let the devil out ?
Wasn't Angela a character owned by Image Comics and fought against Spawn???
Is Daredevil fighting Helya or Valkyria?
Please tell me Angela going to be Vanguard?
Okay so we've got Daredevil and... who's the other one?
Who is the one-winged angel?
What does a devil and an angel have to do with dragons? Nothing. Why do chinese companies work SO hard to insert Asian themes into their games every few months? Do American games force a cowboy theme several times a year? Do Nordic company games force Viking themes every few months? Just curious, do Chinese companies literally have a government mandate to do this? Because I see it in game after game whose over all theme has nothing really to do with chinese culture and feels in conflict with the world building in those games to the point of being immersion breaking.
More of these animations please??
Why is Angela evil and attacking daredevil?
who's the woman?
Bro is that the GOAT Aleks Le voicing Daredevil????
Bros deal with mephisto or what? how he keep up with angela
Oh shoot, Daredevil? First character to not be a part of that initial leak. Wonder if any plans had to be changed
Who is that woman?
Oh, a new season for Marvel Rivals, WAIT ITS COMING FOR PS4????
Why is Marvel rivals animation keep getting better and better🤯
What do you mean daredevil scrapping with god ??? 😂
Have yall considered making an anime?
Why are your teasers so F-ing Flashy?   It becomes uncomfortable to watch them. Also they look cheap and make you seem a bit "desperate for attention".
On ps4 ???????????????   Thanks
will the screen be black when playing as daredevil?
I wonder will they add she-hulk or rogue someday?
So they're using a version of daredevil with like more powerful powers? I only know Netflix daredevil so it may be some comic version I'm unaware of.
Excited but more DPS?!
Why add Angela when u could’ve added so many better characters, like apocalypse, doom, exodus, sentry, etc… also still no cross progression so what’s the point
I wonder if this Daredevil is under the influence of The Beast. I’d assumed this would be like the white suit Hand of God daredevil, given divine power, but the “let the devil out” when he activates his ult and darkness of his power up seem to imply it’s something malicious.
Why does daredevils voice sound like Alex Lee the voice of Jin woo from solo leveling
Who is the other person who isn’t daredevil?
Where is Polaris??? I see a trinket for her, but come on, lets get her in the game already!!

Is daredevil voice actor same as Jiren from dragon ball ?
Is this the version of Daredevil that is possessed by the beast of the hand?
What in the marvel holy war is happening?!?!
Why are they not making a show with this animation
Surprised more people aren't mentioning this, but does this mean we're about to get a true flying tank? Wonder how that works if so
Anyone see the ps4 Playstation Logo or is just me? 😮
Nobody Lord with both yet? Casuals.
When's cross progression?
Can someone tell me the name of that angel girl??
Cross progression when?
is the angel lady Valkyrie or someone else?
Are they both tanks
Hmmm… I wonder what Angela’s lore in this is? since Hela already exists as Loki and Thor’s sister, you’d think they’d retcon Angela, but no, here she is in all of her ablicious glory.
WHAT ARE THEY FEEDING THESE ANIMATORS
Wait who is the bad guy this season?
When Cross Progressions?!
How is daredevil able to match blows with an angelic god?    he's a REALLY good lawyer

Am I the only one who knows Angela is connected to Spawn?
Sooo can we get a support instead?
What do they feed the animators

I wonder if Daredevil will actually play very different than his comic book versions with actual super power speed judging from this trailer. He is probably powered up by someone or something
I wonder if Matt ultimate ability would be like that cloak and dagger terror cape ability where the whole enemy team would get blinded for a certain time limit
They got Alex le?!
Is he dps???
IS THAT ALEKS LEE MY GOAT?? All im ever gunna hear playing daredevil is lighter
I need an explanation on why Daredevil is suddenly anime fast & super strong enough to fight Thor’s sister? Unless this is just a trailer presentation & nothing to do with the lord of the game.
Who are the actors who make the voices?
Yo guys, i have decent aim in rivals but i am hard stuck plat. Any tips to rank up ?
What kinda super soldiers serum is Matt on to even be going toe to toe with a Demo Goddess. Trailers gas$$$$
Is that Aleks Le?
So I read the description and it seems this isn't Matt Murdock but someone called Dizang? Or am I wrong?
alright is it me, or is daredevil moving like that suspicious?? like ik he's acrobatic and shi, but to be moving LIKE THAT??? nahh he's gotta be possessed by the Beast cuz aint no way he'd have THAT much power
What did those animators smoke to produce something like that? Holy.
What in the Asuras Wrath is going on here
Who is she?!
Now that Angela is in the game... When is Venom getting his (not)Spawn costume?
The best I've ever seen Dare Devil look.  Who the heck is the other female character? and Where is she from?? Iron Fist comics?
IS THAT MY GOAT ALEKS LE?????????????
Midtown for DareDevil Anyone? I wonder if Charlie Cox would be playing his character with his fans?
Who's the chick?
Can Daredevil actually do these things?
Any chance he’s a strategist? 😂
What's with Angela's build? That's a little too bulky for Angela, even for Marvel Rival's standards. She's not huge or very muscular in comics, just lean/toned looking in a few, but definitely never bulky.
Stay on 2k26 grinding badges or come back to rivals?  🤔
How is Daredevil is able to fight an Asguardian? It's kinda lame giving street tier character too much powers.
How is he doing all dat
So is daredevil being powered up by Shou-Lao or the Beast?
WTF?!!!!  This is man or woman?
Who is he fighting
Why does Marvel Rivals animation look way better than Marvel Studio's animation?
Did anyone else notice that red hand above her head after the transformation. Hopfuly it's called the red right hand !!  1:13
I wonder if they'll do the red and yellow suit as a ranked reward
Patrick Seitz as Daredevil? Did I hear the voice right?
No xbox one?
How is this game gonna run on someone’s PS4 from 2013?  Can’t wait for that instalock DPS PS4 player running at 30FPS to throw my games.
Who the f is Dizang?
Why is no one talking about the PS4 logo at the end?
Is this matt? Or some other dude as DD as a comic variant?
Who is the big muscle mommy??
Marvel, ATP,  just make a netflix series please.   Also when is deadpool gonna be released? I really want him 👅👅
why there a heart beat at the end of the video? skills teaser?
why i feel like this version of Daredevil like Khazan the berserker?
imma sound stupid... whose the hot one? no not daredevil...the other one.
WHO IS SHE? NAME
Animated tv show when?
Everyone is just talking about Daredevil, but who is the woman???
Why tf Valkyrie is so buffed 😭 ?
Is it just me or does this look like an anime opening
Is that Angela? Wow, deep cut for a character pick.
I know dare devil but who is she?
1:13 Is that Patrick Seitz? That roar reminds me of Jiren
Can we get more Vanguards please? There are already too many DPS.
Where are Deadpool?
Wait, PS4? Is this real? Are my dreams finally coming true?
Imma need some help from the comments, whos the muscle one winged angel lady?
So do we get a black screen as we play as Daredevil ?
Is that a freaking Angela? Also it may be the first chinese game where they are not afraid to make a muscular female.
How much more tuff can a game get…
Still using Neil Gaiman's characters in big 2025? 🤔
Is that third dragon a new character or the main villain?1:33
Pause, is Daredevil voiced by Alex Lee?
Who is that buffed dude and why is he cosplaying Angela?
Is that aleks le as daredevil?
What in the anime…. That sequence was so hard.
Sword of gram mentioned in dialogue this season AND Angela coming next season?  Oh yeah we're getting an AOA Loki skin for sure
Ps4 getting a port? What about Xbox One??
why tf did they make daredevil chinese??
So a tank and a DPS release?
why tf is matthew chinese?
Is it bad if i want that you would see absolutelly nothing as Daredevil?😂 Only when you hear something?
1:15 date devil ability? Look at the eye hand. He makes others blind, like cloak?
Why does Angela have abs.....
Why are his eyes glowing? There’s nothing there. His ears should be glowing
How will they pull this off on PS4?
So...another DPS?
Two new Vanguards?
Are these gonna be their default skins??
I wonder what power up DD got in lore so that he’d be able to fight that other character who idc about but ik is powerful
PS4 before Switch 2? that's weird... 😅
what in the naruto sasuke fight was that holyyyyyyyyy
Another muscle mommy?
Will she be a vanguard? Please?
Am i tripping or is everyone going over the fact that its releasing on ps4 too? 😭😭
Is his passive js a black screen
Why they giving daredevil this much motion 😮
What daredevil  is this??
Does anyone know their voice actors?
Does that angel lady know she’s beating up a blind guy?
Can't wait to see Angela get some well deserved spotlight!  Also I wonder if Iron Fist will get a Danny Rand costume since it seems this season will have big Iron Fist /mystical city themed! 🤞🏻
Heaven vs Hell in a Dragon vs Tiger Depiction?  Yall cooking
Is the other character Aldrif Odinsdottir? Lost sister of loki and thor, firstborn of odin. If so, another obscure character, nice.
1:29 what’s that in the bottom left hand corner?
Uhhhhh is daredevil on steroids or something? I don’t remember him being able to do all that 💀
blind character, do we need to use only our ear to play him?
Can someone post a reference where DD is actually this powerful?
wait is Angela gonna be the 4.5 new hero then? if so it's time to become a muscle mommy enjoyer
So Angela clearly a Vanguard. Is DD a support? As a support main, I'm going to lose it if he is (in a good way 😅)
Why are there 2 more Duelists?
1:35 why does it say PS4?!?!?
I wonder Kingpin reacts a this trailer's daredevil...
How is daredevil going toe to toe with her?
Angela went from fighting Spawn to Daredevil  What at a transition!!!?
Bro where DareDevil get all this? What comic did he do a fraction of this in??
Muscle mommies in rivals before gta 6?!
Another season without new supports? 😥😥😥
Can someone tell me who that female character is? I’m not well versed with comic so I have absolutely no idea who she is
I know who daredevil is but who the hell is that bombshell??
WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT HOW IT SAID PS4 AND PS5 AT THE END?!!
Subtitles say Dizang, others are saying Angela.... Can she just take me now?
Are they just downgrading quality of the game for PS4 just cuz of switch 2 Nintendo doesn't care about 3rd party games and only care about there own games
is Angela a tank? is she gonna be flying? my 2nd main after Emma finally they listened ❤
Why is no one complaining that yet again we got another DPS character? 🤦
Why is daredevil fighting an asgardian
CAN WE GIVE THE ANIMATORS AND VOICE ACTORS AND THE SOUND DESIGNERS A RAISE?!
Why at first did that actually sound like Charlie Cox
That dude in red looks cool, but who is he?  “Daredevil.”  That street level glow up is worse than Tom Holland insta-Avenging.
Is the Daredevil VA Aleks Le? Aka JinWoo from Solo Leveling
All of this... just for Hela?!
Flying Vanguard??? Can I dream?
Charlie Cox skin when?
Is daredevil from Psylocke universe? Why does he have proper superpowers
What in the unholy name of Shounen Manga is this JoJo nonsense?  Looks cool but not how I expected Daredevil to be portrayed.
I currently play on Series S, but...  The idea of welcoming players from other generations is great, but what about the Xbox One crowd? It's a slight lack of consideration.
So Angela's the next main villain, or is someone else working behind the scenes?
What is the name of this anime
anyone willing to bet these are two dps ?
Is Angela supposed to be this buff? Wow!
When are we getting a TV Show in this style?
Can u guys stop making everything asian themed?
Is he gonna have powers or is that just visuals for the trailer?
That's not Matt Murdock, is it? I hope I'm wrong but it looks like he will get the Danny Rand treatment
Im not pratical of comics, i know that he is daredevil but who is she?
Good lord what are they feeding these animators??  They keep cooking 😭

Is this aleks lee voicing daredevil?
When fix matchmaking?
Iron fist buff ?
Isn't Angela from spawn?
Maybe Dare Devil is a dual Rhienhart heart type? like he is agile but he Fights with chains. Instead of blocking his shield dodging for brief intervals. Angela might be like Junker queen that would be bad ass!! Ult seems like Groots tho.
So is Daredevil a hero or a villain?
Is this on ps4?
waw amazing but why is angela so buffed lol? also is it me or could she be a flying hero? also can we maybe see the 1st flying tank? maybe? love the 1 wing only thing

Why tf is dare devil looking so big
Why was daredevil movin like iron fist bruh

Can we please get something different than Chinese themed characters ? I know it's coming from a Chinese company, but it would be cool to not have so much Chinese influence on every hero
Did Odin only feed Angela and Thor?

Is that…. A flying tank I see?
How many buffs will Luna get this time?
