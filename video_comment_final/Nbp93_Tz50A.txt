Were they sponsored by Louis Vuitton in this era, almost all their outfits had a piece of LV😭
I like Le sserafim veryuch but i hate their dress... who choose their fashion actually?
Bro.. sakura is real? OMG she's so pretty 😭
can they sing live ?
YUNJIN WHAT WAS THAT VOICE?
is there any way I can get the Sakura Thumbnail pic ?
why would you cut to chaewon during zuha's special moment
who's the name of the girl om the thumbnail?
What is this thing in minute 2:03 😐
WHO IS THE GIRL WITH THE CAP
Am i the only one thinking they kinda look like the move too fast? It looks like someone speed it up. If you compare it to the dance practice and the performance version. Or maybe its just the camera work
How is chaewon’s medallion defying the laws of physics?
Who choreographed this ?
who is in the blue LV pants? she is giving anime girl vibes
😭 Chaewon’s so talented it took me a while to notice her hat… is she cosplaying an Arabian prince?
HONG EUNCHAE is only 17 is this song appropriate? I love this group but wish HYBE didn't make these girls appeal to the male gaze most songs.
LMAO IS YUNJIN OKAY??? THE ENDING???
who is in red hair?
what are they wearing :p lol
what's with the fire alarm out of battery beeps?
can anyone tell me who is who ? I've been listening to a lot of their songs but never really learnt their names yet, now is the time 👀
I'm the only one who finds it problematic that Eun-chae only sings once??
Why hasnt anyone said anything about kazuha?? She’s improved so muchh im so proud ❤❤
Why are they this coolllll
Am i tripping or Did manchae only got two parts only?
What is the name of chaewon’s kind of hat/“hijabish” (not sayint it’s a hijab just didn’t know to explain it)
Is it just me or eunchae has barely enough lines?
What was that yunjin at the end 😂 enjoying her dance but then laughing cause she’s so adorable & funny 😂
Why does eunchae have so few lines?
Is it only me that I view the choreo is too extra for this soft song?
Who else thinks KAZUHA is gaining more confidence? Because we need to talk more about how she's literally unstoppable in this comeback.
LE SSERAFIM's 2000s hip-hop outfits are like what?
am i the one that noticed yunjin’s shout at the end?? 🤣
Did they were the shoes zack costumies???
Is there any other song - recommendations with this vibe?
Just curious. Anyone here a new LE SSERAFIM fan because of this song? 🤚🏻
Ok 1 more random comment…why does Sakura have the most beautiful shoulders? lol I never thought shoulders were attractive until I saw Sakura 😂💜
Ysabelle Capitule is one of their choreographers?! No doubt I can see the style in this choreography. <#
The picture itself and video quality are very good. but the work of the operators(and editors) is absolutely ignorant.  Why does the angle change every 2 seconds? and always to the unnecessary one. Even with the most banal 1:50, where Chaewon performs a very beautiful moment, you can’t just put a normal angle from the front (slightly from below) so that you can see how she is “approaching” (walking forward) as the trick progresses? Instead, you cut the moment into 3-4 absolutely mediocre pieces, which makes it completely impossible to see the choreography properly.
DOES IT MAKES SENSE CHAEWON CATCHES MY EYES EVERY COMBACK??
Who wrote the lyrics 😭🙂
kura in the thumbnail?????? crazy face sakura!!!!
What about Eunchae parts? So short 😢
Why is one wearing a do rag and the other wearing a Mexican bandanna
They're so photogenic in every single frame. And... EXCUSE ME... THAT'S OUR MAKNAE EUNCHAE ?????
0:41 HELLO THE WAY EUNCHAE DOES THIS MOVE????
Whats wrong with the view? Why likes is more :(
Is it just me, or was this filmed with jerking? Like frames were removed to make it seem animated? That's sort of a problem when watching dancing technique/style... Studio Choom??
How many international fans are here?
What happened to Yunjin at the end? Did she cringe at herself? 😂😂
I wonder how they'll be able to keep up with live performances with this choreography, i hope id see them sing live
why the view is stuck 😢
Am i only the one who hears when sakura sings its always autotune??🤨🤨
Any international fans here??
Who is before 1 million view?
Are we ever going to get kazuha, yunjin and eunchae as thumbnails also?  *just a question it doesn't mean I hate the other two*
What le sserafim can’t do?
