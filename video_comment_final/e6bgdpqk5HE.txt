Is Gary considered cool in UK culture? Because guys like him in the states are seen as massive dorks
"how donthey do that?" "Training"  Is Roy's new "thats his job" 😂😂😂
Man Utd top 4? In 5 years time maybe
Whats that word for the fear of missing out?
How has the overlap not got 5 million subs?
Will you guys ever do a stick to football LIVE? It would be great to come and watch one of these in person in an arena
Community Question. how do you send them?
WHYYYY do they have to eat and drink? Fine, have the first part be that, but once it starts, just remove it. I wish we could get this series without that, its sooo infuriating to listen to.
where is the line with rest though? regular normal gym goers hit the gym 6 days a week for years, doesn't a professional sports player just stay fit? why would you do nothing for 2-3 weeks?
Is Gary okay on this show. Seems very tense and worried about Man U season. Bless him
I was signed by United in 1995 when I was 15 years old, but I couldn't become a player because the family of kidnappers that I was living with wouldn't allow me to play, do you think that was fare?
How did no-one pick up that 28 days is 4 weeks 😂
Just watched Wrighty hosting Top of the Pops in 1997 , on YouTube.. has Roy seen it ?
Wheres is wazza?
You moving on or what? Love it!!! 😂 right after a hard time 😢
Did Jamie just give credit to Casemiro? 😂
Why when Gary says something about United that Jamie doesn't agree with or like, does Jamie just completely shouts him down and try to belittle him? Just let him make his point!!
How did Gary not see the viral parts of the Olympics!? 😂 Does he not talk to anyone?
Do they get paid for this? My friends and I do this every week for free!
What is g nev on about
Why does Roy Keane think everybody has to do things as he does or wants 😅 the man's got a major god complex 😂
Is it 30 year old daughter or 13 year old daughter??
When are we getting a Sir Alex and Roy reunion on the overlap?  Surely Gary can build the bridge?
What does Ian call Gary? Cos he's not saying Gary and I can't work it out. I've only ever heard Gaz as an alternative to Gary 😂
Why is Carra so aggressive when ANYTHING regarding United is brought on the table for discussion? Somebody needs to tell him to tone down and let the United people at least say what they want to. He doesn't let Gary complete ONE SENTENCE about United's midfield 4 when Mount was injured for a big chunk of time and Mainoo wasn't playing until November.
Love the fit of Cara t-shirts. What brand is that?
Can someone explain to me the new champions league format? will they be more games?
Why did Carra come back? The show runs smoother without him
Man City won't win a 5th - Pep & the squad will be more focused on the CL and the energy the unprecedented 4th took cost them the CL and probably the FA Cup as well... Whoever tops Arsenal wins the League But this season has a lot of imponderables - Newcastle look stronger and they've no european football, Villa have strengthened but will a debut CL and a domestic cup being the only realistic trophy target cost them in the league? Liverpool, Man Utd, Arsenal or Newcastle to win the League, Man City to finish 3rd or 4th but they'll win the CL. Spurs will get 5th but will win the Europa League. England get 5 CL places for 2025/26
The full gang are back?!! ❤
why do they always try and belittle gary? i don't care if you call it "banter" have a bit of respect for the man. it's weird to watch. you can see the glee on jamie's face when it's happening. he's a bully. feels like watching high school kids. grow up.
Why do these man get hyped when it comes to talking about united. Calm down Cara
An hour dedicated to Keane's birthday?
Did they mention Newcastle once?
Putting 4 sugurs and not even stirring the bastsrd...wrighty???
Will you still be doing punditry in the next 10 years??  Absolutely FOOKIN not! 😂
Is it just me or does the show not need Cara?
Fecking hell, can someone let them know there’s more than 4 or 5 teams in the league? 😂
Why do the British talk over each other 😭
How many times does Sherga have to tell this story?? This is the fourth time she's told this tale! Boring
Need to know where Ian gets his glass frames from?
Do they speak about England in this episode or is that skipped?
How many liverpool players wanted to play for klopp and failed   Keita number 1 beast at RB and was Gerrards replacement 😂
Is it just me of do these guys know very little outside their utd city liverpool and arsenal bubble?
Is it type 1 or 2 diabetes that Ian has? 😂
God sometimes I wonder if Gary actually watches united play? Mount doesn’t and shouldn’t start
Klopp's Liverpool never took 4 points off Pep's Man City. Why are Arsenal held to a higher standard?
What wasn’t discussed was the challenge for Arsenal this season is they probably need to do even better against the top 4 teams to beat City, but I doubt they will win as many points against the top teams this season as they did last season.
How is united a lock for top 4 where as liverpool might finish 7 when united literally finished 8th last season
Villa lose Luis and play in CL and they're getting top 4? Drop me out.
do they talk about de ligt at any point if so at what point, thank you
How do you watch this and not just smile and laugh along?? Love it! Looking forward to another season! Spread love all
How does everyone miss that United's midfield looked open because the defensive line was so deep?
You look good for 53? Why what is 53 meant to look like?
How are Man Utd one of the top clubs, they finished 8th?
Do they always all talk at the same time ?
Do we have to sit and listen to them eating for ten mins every week?
Is that harry kanes twin sister ?
Wild how they never mention City's hearing in September. The decision on punishment is likely to follow around spring 2025. How is that not going to affect their season? Imagine the run in when they've just been told they're getting relegated and Pep declares he's off. It will overshadow their whole season.
What kind of tea is being served?  Anyone know?
Anyone notice how Gary was shitting himself a little bit when a Roy walked in? 😂
Can you stop talking over each other?
what was the documentary Carra talks about at 15:52???
Whos been on their holidays? 😂 thinking us mere mortals can even afford a holiday these days.
is the sound abit  laggy
Is Gary on a wind up this year?? 😂😂😂
Can you guys make a super sox league and the winner gets to come for a day or something?
How’s your buddy Keir getting on Gary?
How can the Roy Keane Birthday Cake segment be nearly an hour long hahah😅
"What was the jumping like.. Were you jumping with the same Gary Neville face?" Hahaha
Are we just pretending the European Final didn’t happen haha
How am I supposed to get things done when they pop these episodes out?
Why is Barry Bannan moonlighting here.......
They were cutting the cake for 50 minutes? Such bad time markers
Why did they have to bring carrager  back? Been so good without him. Can't stand the bloke 😒
Are these people incapable of having a conversation without stuffing their faces? The food situation's ridiculous.
Can some one tell Carragher to stop whispering. It's not a secret
Southampton to beat Newcastle? 😂
“Where do you see yourself in 10 years, Roy”?  “Do you think you’ll still be here”?  “No… I mean doing the podcasts, not dead” 😂😂😂
How can anyone back a united team that finished 8th to finish above spurs and villa
Why does Jamie get so passionate about Utd, they talked about City and Arsenal he never said a word, then I was guns a blazing ready to criticise Utd. 😅
I wonder what would of happened if one of the players caught one of the pickpockets nicking their phone....
Since they're being wetties can we do relegated teams?  Forest Bournemouth Ipswich
How many people sucking up to Keane and his fake laugh today?
Will we ever get their views on Euros 2024 final on this podcast
Newcastle top 4?
Did u redden the lighting so that Roy doesn’t look too angry? 😅 everyone’s reddd
When’s wrighty bringing in his pies for everyone to try?
How have they not addressed the euros still is baffling.
Anyone play fpl? ld00nk join league
Does ian want some coffee with that sugar?
Love the Overlap! Excited for another season, they always keep it fresh and change small things in the format to keep it interesting!!   Which is better, Overlap or Rest is Football? 🤔
