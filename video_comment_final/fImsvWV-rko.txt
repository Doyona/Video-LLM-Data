Where’s the Epilogue episode???
Is there going to be epilogue?
Is there not a part 2?
there is a 9 year age difference. will that make a difference?
Why cant we get 6 or 8 episodes of all access just charlo and davids brother would have crazy ratings with the drama showtime is done with boxing so give the fans some episodes to watch leading up to the fight
What's the name of the song at 3:00?
Has Andrade pulled out yet or been popped for roids ??? It’s fight week lol u know the routine with this joke
where in the world is part 2? one of the biggest fights of the year and PBC/Showtime drops the ball yet again!
YALL STILL AINT DROPPED PART 2 ?!?! 🤦🏾😭
2:56 what is the name of this song?
Where’s part 2?
Hi...how is the song of 2:55 time? Thanks for comments.
How you still not have the smoke detector fixed???
Who does everyone have on this one
What is the song playing at the end?
is it me or am I the only person that caught David in the back gesturing money, when his dad was telling them he loved them?
Childhood issues addressed...how is that going to affect his son's fights ? I think David looks incredibly motivated in his eyes to me.
Has Benavidez always trained in Seattle? Seems like an odd location
Why do women do that? 🤢 It looks abnormal and disgusting. Y'all all wanna be Kim K. or something?? Yikes.
What type of cat was that
Are they half brothers
Why do they have too do away with these vidoes 😔man these are always so enjoyable like an end off an era😭😭😭😭😭
Does Andrade have heart we’re going to find out if he’s coming to win and FIGHT.
Can someone tell me why Hispanics refuse to change their smoke detector batteries?
All Access Or Hard knocks?
Why’s this dork wearing shades while he’s training?? 😂
I wonder where PBC is gonna go to next? I know it's somewhere fire. Like Fox Sports
A cheetah 🐆 wtf ? 😂
How can showtime give up boxing that shit crazy
Why do they keep call someone Born in Arizona a Mexican?
Benavidez move out of Az?
the cat, is that Stryker?
Where is the Ecuatorian mom? hope to see her on the fight the 25
Is it me or this mf was tryna sound like Mike Tyson on the podium 😭😭😭
Now tell me why none of these guys talk about Bivol??
Is this not the most exciting cars this year?
What kind of BbL is that?
Why is this fight ppv?😂
What’s up with the propaganda to weaken men at the end?
So who gonna do all access now? 😭😭😭 this what gets me hyped for the fight…
Was it just me or does Andrade not know how to interview? He seems a little immature and uneducated.
Is Andrade out of his mind?
David looks a little bigger then his bro do they both fight at super middle? And how does David have three WBC belts I know he's Interim champ but how does have the other 2 isn't Canelo undisputed? Are those old belts? If so fighters only come out with the belts they currently control or have in my experience David got stripped twice correct?
With showtime boxing going away does that mean that PBC is done too?
This is last all access ?😢
Why do mfers use a giant cast iton to cook a couple eggs
🤔BOO BOO??? Don’t black people call pooping BooBoo???💯💯🤦🏽‍♂️
Hey is he just carrying his belt because he won it before ?? Because he isn’t a title holder anymore right?? He was stripped ??
😂 Mannnn...WTH is up with u fellow Mexicans: in this comment section specifically, being so salty about Barrera-AND-JMM supporting David Benavidez; & @ the fact they favor him in a future, potential bout versus Canelo Alvarez?!? 🤔  Like it's such a weird ass dynamic going on. Yesss, I understand that Benavidez is a "Mexican AMERICAN"(& NOT FROM LAND/NATION OF 🇲🇽), but HE'S STILL OF MEXICAN BLOOD(DESCENT), NONETHELESS.! TF?! Bc it's looking hella divisive, OF SOME OF YA'LL, TBH... Which is highly usual & rare coming from ya'll, bc most of the time, u guys are typically well known for: sticking together AND supporting one another= having 💯(COMPLETE) UNITY.!
Does boo boo have a lisp
Wtf was that a Damn Bob Cat ? Almost gave Jose's face a few buck 50s ... Is that even illegal to have as a pet ...
Both of their styles are tailored made for each other….someone is gonna look very good in comparison to the other…only question is who??
DB lives in Seattle? Wtf😂
is this one getting a epilogue ?
Damn so does this only leave Dazn and ESPN left?
