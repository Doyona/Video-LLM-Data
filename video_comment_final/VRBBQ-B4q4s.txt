She was ill?? Wow 👌
Who is the choreographer? Must be super talented

Isn't that the girl who won Eurovision 2024?
what is that? as a greek i feel sorry for Europe and the spot we stole from you
Isn't that the girl who won Eurovision 2024?
Does it explain her behavior during the press conference when Eden Golan was talking?  Or being sick doesnt reduce the level of hatred?
WHAT KIND A SONG THIS? Very bad performance, my family will vote for different artist, btw is she greek? Dont think so…
What are the names of the dancers? They were so brilliant!! Much love from greece
Who does Greece want to win? 🇬🇷🏆
She forgets to sing at the mic 3 times in the first 20 seconds in an international stage are you serious? Hope she does well in the final not like this one..
Which countries will vote for Greece in the final?❤🇬🇷🇬🇷
She is 37 years old? WTF?! 😱 She looks so damn young, I thought she was in her early 20s😅♥
Can someone fix the sound for the final ? And Marina please don’t forget the microphone  Get well soon ❤
And at what passage between the pseudo rap, shouting and incoherent instrumentals was an actual SONG (you know, theoretically this should be a song contest) hidden?? 🤔
does she say oppa in the middle of the song? i heard it wrong
How is she 37 btw? I’d absolutely believe it if someone told me she’s 17.
Eurovison Athens 2025??
Isn't that the girl who won Eurovision 2024?
sorry, please tell me if my country didn't make it to the finals, can I vote in the finals?
Is it a bad thing to be straight?
What does she say after 'opa' at 2:29 and what does it mean?
She looks 28 but she's 37??
Is this turkish song?😂😂😂
Isn’t that the winner of Eurovision 2024???
Tragic story - her father's passing, and... Her passing ...on, to the finals ... Why the hell did she make it?? 🤦‍♂️  I guess 12 year olds accross Europe got bored and the parents didn't care where their kids were calling to??? Jeezus Christ...🙄
Greece is one of my favorite entries this year but what the hell was Marina thinking when she decided to wear this ugly silver oversized diaper ???
Did anyone mention she lost her father and contracted pharyngitis with high fever yet?
Who is here before marina is winner on Saturday?
Is it only me or this is Motomami's Rosalía but in Greek?
Is she Italian or what lol
how can this not win on Saturday?
Is it just me or does it smell like Eurovision Athens 2025? 🎉
How can I stop listening to this over and over again? I loved it❤
Who thinks that Greece will win? 🇬🇷
what are the names of those dancers boys behind? 💦
Why it sounds like Hindi music 😂😂
And she made it to final?
is this lip sync?
Isn’t this the girl that won Eurovision 2024? 🎲🇬🇷
- How many times did you see it? - MA-RI-NAA 🎲🤍🤍👏🏼 She slayed up there even though she had fever!!!
Why didn't she use a mouth microphone ? Trying to sing into the handheld microphone while dancing is impossible to do right with those kind of dances.
Is she winning or what ?
Anyone cyprus here???🇬🇷🇨🇾
Please tell me of which songs this song reminds me?! I just can‘t figure it  out 😭😭😭 I need to knoooooooow ❤️
If she doesn't win, then who should do it anyway?
Why no one talks about the choreography??? It’s amazing and super difficult to dance and sing ALL THE TIME. The dancers also SLAY!
Why she didnt use headworn microphone, i mean she is dancing too.. so is not so comfortable to hold a microphone
Is playback permitted???
This is fun, but do you think she got sympathy votes?
Can please someone call her and tell her that she needs to wear a headworn microphone. It would solve all the problems with her forgetting to sing into the microphone.
Why did they have to ruin the song with those ugly out place tiktok style additions that shouldnt be part of any quality performance. The staging and presentation completely ruined this
Okay but why did she forget she had a microphone so much? Anyway, I still love and support her
How did this pass?
Seriously? Most of the song was played with a playback
Who is the winner 🥇? MA RI NA🇬🇷💜💜💜
-How many times you saw this? -MARINAAA
How does likes more than views???? Maybe is playback or recording from rehearsal.
Well…. Isn’t that a little albanian/turkish ? 🙈🙈🙈
of the year eurovision in Greece.where can i find the tickets? ❤❤❤
How can Slimane stand 2 meters away from his mic and you can hear him perfectly but Marina's mic goes in and out when she is still holding it? Get her the same mic please! 😕
Who is here after Greece’s qualification?
what did you think of Marina?
Isn't she ill right now? And still she slayed
i love this song so much, but staging ruined everything also please can she stop with copying rosalia? that last pose with dancers is literally ripoff from motomami tour
Massively let down by the staging and coreography, tf was that???
who do they want Marina to beat?
WHY DO SO MANY PEOPLE DISLIKE THE PERFORMANCE?? imo its a very silly and fun performance, I genuinely dont get it.
