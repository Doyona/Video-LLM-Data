40:18 why does that remind of the golden plates somehow? 😂
Does Marissa have a baking channel now?
Marissa, was that you as a teacher on the 9-1-1 series, season 2 episode 18?
Are they allowed to taste their food? Like I’ve seen a few of these and haven’t heard a rule that says they can’t taste it… but I don’t feel like they ever taste anything 😂
How did she win Wedding cakes without a recipe with a divorce cake!? 😂
But it’s not a WEDDING cake???????
Sorry just clicked cause of the thumbnail, girls with bewbs name please?
who's gonna tell keith about hand mixers???
Which episode of without a recipe is it where Keith puts yeast in his cake?
why are the judges always so unnecceserily hard on zach
Did anyone notice the glass spilling at 44:35? 😂
Okay, I love this series, HOWEVER, could you PLEASE teach new bakers how to use their baking tools and machines properly??? That was so scary watching her with the mixer and not making sure the bowl was secured before she turned it on. People can get seriously hurt when they don't know what they're doing.
WHY ARE THEY MIXING SHIT WITH THEIR LITERAL HANDS SKIN 😂😂😂😂😅 22:44
Why is no one talkin bout how precious keith luks in the dresssssd🖤😭
can we appreciate how, at 39:36, in the transition between Zach and Keith's judging, the clip was a lesbian couple?! 🏳‍🌈🏳‍🌈❤🧡🤍💗💓
Anyone notice Jonny knock over a full glass of champagne at 44:33? 😂
Anyone else find it just unbelievably creative that Keith made a pine simple syrup?
What happened with Marissas mixer? How did it break I feel like I mixed something
So Marrisa is getting her own cooking show right?
Is it me or Keith's cake looks like a big tamal oaxaqueño 😂
Wheres the live finale? 👀 i feel like we never got the proper ending to this season of WAR....
They addressed the poison but not the glass shrapnel?
I haven't been watching Try Guys for a while, but this video made me smile ❤  I'm guessing the judges don't take points away for if the cake doesn't meet theme criteria? I thought they used to take that into consideration? Regardless, her cake was sooo awesome! Well deserved, especially taking into account its made without a recipe! 👏🏼
Is that Chandler? 😭💔
Is anyone else annoyed at the woman cutting the slices. Is she just bad at it? I wanted to see Rosanna and Jonny try their hand at cutting cakes.
I feel like we’re all a bit too chill about the poison??? How tf did that happen, who let that go through???
Does anyone know where the lamps above the jury are from?
I love these random kinky fun facts, and jokes throughout this season! Will the Try Guys be making a kink series in the future? 😂 @johnnycakes ❤❤
why is keith’s cake blurred out at 27:03 😭
why was keith’s cake blurred 27:03
How come their fondant all look....like...the same... all...good. and Eugene's came out of a bag. Did they not make their own fondant ??
What video is this from
I wonder how chaotic it would be to have a Without a Recipe x Phoning It In special? Instead of the chefs phoning in, it'll be the guys? HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Anyone else see Johnny knock over the glass of Champagne? 😂
Why does the crew keep wearing masks? I haven’t had to wear a mask at work for a year and I work with customers
Was this a Eugene special because of the absence? He was SO inspired! And the mom call was the cherry on top 😂😂😂
How did Eugene still mix his batter for an ungodly amount of time and still not get last again 😂😂
is no one gonna mention how great Keith looked in that dress?
Is that Jim and Pam on top of Keith’s cake??
Is it just me or in the judgment from 46 eugene does not look like he is there ... Is there some green screen thing going on there
Nobody eats the wedding cake?? Maybe if your cake sucks. The diabetics at my wedding went back for seconds.
How do we get Eugene's mom to be a judge on one of these?
Does anyone else think the batters Keith and Eugene were mixing looked so gross? Or the way Keith just slapped on the frosting cake crumble mixture? I was genuinely surprised how good all cakes ended up looking, considering how messy especially those two were working. No hate, just saying the process looked far from appetising.
can they practice beforehand?
Anyone notice Johnny just own his wine glass?
So who won the live special?
Did anyone notice that the plant Keith used wasn't actually pine? It looks like a cypress of some type. Couldn't have been a juniper because they would have smelled and tasted that.  Nobody died, so that's something 😂
Did anyone else almost get teary eyes when Johnny praised Marissa?
Will The Live Show Be On YouTube After The Showing?
where can i buy zach's lavender suit???
Eugene literally gave them poison but somehow didn’t come 4th?
Are we going to acknowledge how gorgeous Marissa is with her hair slicked back like this or..?
Pffff why did they censor the stair?
I’m sorry, 2 days?!?! It takes professionals longer than that to make and decorate a cake
Does anyone know where Ro got her dress?? So pretty
Can I still order cod tickets even though it’s the day after?
Can we talk about how great Zach looks in that lavender though?!!!
Is no one talking about how iconic "Today we're all wife guys" in the intro was?? 😂
Does Keith not like Jonny lol? He always has a weird vibe towards him
Why does Marissa kinda look like aubrey plaza in the thumbnail?
Eugene looks so HANDSOME?!?!?!?!?! Is it the color of the modern Hanbok or just the modern Hanbok or BOTH OR JUST EUGENE
Can we just appreciate how awesome Marissa looks?
How did y’all get lilac hydrangeas when I told it would cost $30/flower to get them for my wedding
Fuchsia? How is that light pink fuchsia?
Did NOBODY notice how after Keith's joke about "Butter Makes The Batter Better" being a slogan on a sign in a mom's kitchen, the video immediately cuts back to Jonny with that sign edited onto the wall behind him? 11:59 I am LIVING for these editing details! Mad props to whoever snuck that in there!
Is anyone else picking up the weird mood between Eugene and the others? 😢
How on earth did Keith make such a dry cake when he soaked it in so many liquids?
Ummm is Eugene like freakishly tall and I never realized? Or is Marissa freakishly tiny? The pan out when they were standing next to each other suprised me.
Why offer hydrangea's at all then? Seemed like a eff up with the producers...
Are we not gonna talk about how Keith slays in this wedding dress???
Why did no one have the forethought to check the flowers they were putting on the cake?
Why don't people put passion fruit in more baking stuff? They're delicious and complement citrus flavors really well. But then again, I guess they're expensive in western countries.
Gin 🎉 amazingly (lol) has strong pine flavor Keith...... Lol soak the cherries in gin next time?
Did evil Eugene sneak in to put poison on his cake
So i have a question for Rachel. What happens to the food these guys make, after the judging?
What kind of cake would you like in your special day? I would love a vanilla blueberry cake with white chocolate doves and cherry blossom designs.
The way Euegene's batter...undulated? in the mixing bowl was really, really upsetting
Is last year’s WAR live on YT?!
People swallow Barbie heads?  Barbie heads are pretty big 🤢🤮 and that plastic hair strands 🤮
Can we get more of Eugene's Mom? She's comedy GOLD.
Did I miss something? In the beginning didn't they say Jared was back in the kitchen too?
So Zach made a Dalek wedding cake? 😂
where were the cute animals ?? great video but I wanted to see penguins in love or something
why do people always go so crazy with baking soda
Whovians out there: Does Zach's cake remind you a bit of a Dalek? 😄
Was that Pirates of the Caribbean music?
How did she guess stairs??? 😂
does anyone know why zach starts snapping his fingers as marisa tells her story? around 45:10
Before I watch, did no one really eat Maggie’s bitten wedding cake? That can’t be fr right? I’d eat tf outta some bitten cake lmfao
Who else wants Ann Reardon to watch these WAR episodes and judge the cakes?
How does kieth loose to poison 🤣
So when does Jonny and Marissa’s YouTube channel launch?!?! 😂 I’d definitely watch them bake together
How can she be the winner! One of the criteria was totally ignored! They agreed it wasn't even a wedding cake!
Did Keith just throw everything he learned in seasons past out the window? 😂
Does Keith think old fashioneds…. Have pine?  Edit nvm I get it now
Why is Keith’s cake blurred at 27:03 ?
Did Keith mix his cake batter in a bus bin? 😳
Why is no one talking about the Matthew Perry nod?  This was filmed before he … 😢
Also, is this the first black female judge???
Am I the only one that wanted them to cut into each layer/tier? I know they couldn’t for Eugene’s cause the flowers, but I wanted to see all the colors in Zack’s layers and the steps in Keith’s.
What cake did Eugene make that no one watched?
Where and how can I watch last years live show?
did anyone feel like there were more ads then usual
Why was I expecting a teardrop shaped cake for a 3 tear 3 tier punny cake.
try staff without a recipe when?
anyone else think Zach's cake looked like a Dalek?  xD
Am I the only one a little disappointed that no one really messed up? 😂
Will the live stream be available to watch later ?? If we can’t attend the live😢
Can we get cute little cooking tips videos where Johnny Cakes teaches Marisa (and us) little cooking tricks or something?? I just really hope she keeps baking I love herrr 🫶🏽🫶🏽
A show where Johnny Cakes teaches Marissa decorating (and/or they team up for baking challenges???) Please & thank you ❤❤❤
What about Kwesi, how could you forget to include him in the final !
Does anyone know if/where can we watch the previous finale livestream of without a recipe?
I just realized: the colors of the tiers on Eugene’s cake are the colors for the Try Guys, and the only one that didn’t have hydrangeas was the one in Eugene’s color. Coincidence? 😏 Jk!
why does keith actually look amazing in that dress??
what's the show that Euege made cake for that no one watched?
Am I tripping or is the energy in the judging segment kinda weird and off? Like either people are drunk, or something happened that had to be edited out/off camera, or the editing itself is weird for this ep but for a finale episode it feels...interesting...
Is anyone else bothered by Marisa using her hand to mix when she literally has a spoon in her hand? Just me? Ok.
How did she guess the stairs? LMAO great episode cant wait to join the live!!
I’m sorry but, Maggie BIT HER WEDDING CAKE??? 😂
Why am I crying over a WAR videos 😭😭😭 johny and Eugene  supporting Melissa has me in tearssss
Can someone please ask Marissa if she's ready for a second husband? I'd like to put her heart back together. 😂
Why does Keith look so natural in a wedding dress?
Can Ro be on with a recipe
IN THAT DRESS?!
Can we please appreciate how hot Marissa is during the judging?! Lawd. Everyone else looks so fabulous as usual.
How did I not know about the hydrangea being poisonous?! Every wedding cake I’ve had brought in to wedding they add extra florals and usually hydrangea
Can we have Eugene’s mom judge an episode next season?
Why does Eugene’s cake batter look like a Leviathan from Supernatural? 😂
why is marissa a grown ass woman and not know how to do anything
How have they STILL not learned to stop over mixing their damn cakes?? It must be on purpose atp you’ve had like 5 cake episodes
Omg…can we get a Jonny Cakes and Marissa collab!?
In that dress?!? 😭😭😂😂😂😂
Can we still watch the live after if we don't buy a ticket?
Can someone please tell me where to watch this darn show they keep mentioning that I didn’t watch? Lol it’s hard to watch a show you don’t know exists!
Is that the produce101 theme song on the background during Zach’s cake presentation? 😂😂 slay
Idea for next season....Without A Recipe: Average Joe Edition. here it's the Try Guys (whichever ones are competing) and then some random person from the street or fan raffle winner! lol like....are they a professional baker? or can they only make food in a microwave? The potential for chaos always lingering in the background!
I had no idea Johnny actually baked i just thought his name was Johnny Cakes and like he was here for... fun? lmao I love him
Why did I think the wedding cake was the live event? The panic I had when I thought I missed the live event! 😂
Excuse me but did no one else notice the “butter makes the batter better honey” behind Johnny?!😂
Omg. CAN WE HAVE EUGENES MOM AS A JUDGE? Or something. Anything. Just bring her on.
Can we just talk about how much of a bad ass Marissa looks like?
Why I am laughing all the way through Keith’s judging?? Wait this is the most I’ve laughed on a Try Guys vid in a long long time.
Is anyone else in love with Marissa? Please being her back!!!
Marissa and Johnny collab?? ❤
Am I crazy, or does Keith's "pine" look nothing like pine?
Can you guys make Zach Nation, Keith Cult, and Eugene Commune shirts please??? 🥺
Where did Qwesi go!? Edit, there's Qwesi ❤
@tryguys Wait can someone tell me i'm not crazy??????? The vid says the Live tomorrow starts at 6, but the website I went to says it starts at 9! Which is the real one?????
Have they considered the many benefits of metal bowls?
Is anyone else getting 90's sci-fi vibes from Zach's cake?
How many eggs will Eugene put in his cake this time?! 😂
When can you watch the final without paying
Are they not given pastry bags and tips??
Why does the thumbnail look like they're all trying to avoid looking at Marissa's chest?
52:10 "in that dress?" IM IN TEARSSS 😂😂😂😂
can a summary video of the finale be posted for those of us who are broke and work during the show
Can somebody tell me why it is /live now instead og /war?
Could the mystery event be Eugene’s wedding? Is that why he will be too busy next year? Will that be one of the mystery events?
Is Eugene purposely over mixing his batter on purpose? As a baker, all I can think is holy fuck!
Is it Saturday already?
who does the dishes when y'all r done?
Marissa is puertoroican?! Yesss my PR qweennn!!! 🇵🇷
Why does Keith low-key look sexy in the dress
How are there not more comments about Jonny and the Barbie doll heads
An episode where everything looks good an edible? What??
Hang on is marissa the first guest star to win an episode? I dont remember that happening before?
they keep mentioning the show that no one watched. did the show not air because of “the incident”, or did it get bad ratings because of “the incident”?
Why is Keith working out of what looks like a dirty dish bucket?! 😭😭 Obvi his was probably never used to bus tables at a restaurant!! But that’s all that I associate those bins with in my mind!! Next season episode 1 should be “Food Safety Practices Without A Recipe”!! And they have a guest judge/instructor just whistling at them when they do weird/improper stuff with kitchen utensils and supplies. (Also the state of Eugene’s station is Exhibit B to my argument!!)😭😭
Can we please have Johnny teaching Marissa about cake making
I feel like I missed the live event?! Is it not tomorrow, Thurs Dec 14? But this is the finale episode of the season??!
Marissa is divorced? Slay
Is the first time a guest won?
Where can i find Johnny's recipe of the cake he made in this episode?
Why does Keith still get mad "as a bit" during judging??? Props to the editor for really exposing how much of a tantrum he threw over nothing but like DUDE... the cringe is too much.
do you think the producers/behind the scenes ever wanna rip their hair out when the try guys are doing astronomically bad? 😭
You guys did amazing!  Doing a wedding cake is a monumental task….if Keiths is inspired by old fashioned wood floors, could you call is “par-cake”? ❤
whyy did no one eat the cake after maggie bit it tho lol, 96% of it are still fine? or was that a joke lol
Why did i almost cry watching Marissa win???!!!???!!
Can we verify with Matt if Eugene is indeed talented with eating as his Mom said??? 😅😅😅😅😅
but are we going to see mentor johnny for our marissa?! SO PROUD OF HOW FAR SHES COME !!!! 🫶🏼🩷✨🫶🏼
Anyone else notice the Sorted "Pass it on" music when Zach's cake was shown?
watching Keith and Eugene both add FAR too much baking soda/powder... did they learn NOTHING from Zach's boo-kake???
I would have watched the previous cake episodes before doing this; is that cheating?
Where keith get that tsa airport bin? 😂😂
Im sorry but since when is PINE a flavor??
Try Guys, with a Recipe Book when?? with ALL the stuff you've guys have made, just made... better so we can remake at home! <3
What show was Eugene on?  Ove seen the show Jonny was on, was it the same show just a different season?
How is it live if there are already previews??🤨
Last season: Are the guys making Johnny uncomfortable with this gimp cake and this bookakke and this foot cake? This season: *Johnny dropping the forbidden barbie swallowing knowledge*
Keith moving everything to the tub and Zach repeatedly saying "what are you doing?" had me howling! 😂😂
I've been wondering this for awhile, who is the narrator for WAR? I love them!
How was Kieth robbed again?!
35:44 why can I hear oh dear oh dear when hearing this song?
What was that weird cut when Eugene was listing the judges? "The head chef of Rosco's Chicken and Waffles..." and sounded like he was about to say the name but there was just an awkward cut. Then it was Nicole on the panel.
Why no caption? 🥺
Keith seemed a bit off today is he ok?
did Zach and Keith Freaky-Friday???? cause why is Keith's batter chaotic and Zach's looks stunning??
….Since when is pine a cake flavor, Keith?
Anyone else tripped up seeing how they’re actually getting good at doing these? 👀
2 videos in one week/ is this on purpose? Yayy
How was Eugene more chaotic than Zach? 😂
Eugene has never been to a gay wedding? That's surprising. I hope he has a good queer community around him.
Too much?? Man, only cheaters do math!
Was the finale live? Paid?
have the guys tried making tamales? would look forward to seeing that :)
Will there be another season of Without a recipe?
How can it only be uploaded 3 minutes ago and someone already spoils the winner ......
How many dozen of eggs will there be in Eugene's cake this time round?
