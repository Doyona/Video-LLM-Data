“Did they have a date for Spain…?”Volk seems so desperate to get his rematch.
Henry didn’t show huh?
Why peeps asking Volk dumb questions
Crazy that these videos always cut off the very beginning. I hate to be negative but why??
How was Rob vs Paulo not fight of the night?..
How do you qulify for the sport intereviewer in here? Half the questions are chatgpt generic shit.
Only 2 seconds in, but how the hell did Rob and Costa not get FOTN?...
So Ilia doesn’t want to fight the previous champs in his division and won’t fight Movsar? Yet he wants to fight Connor, who can barely make 170?!?!?  Lol.  This guy is great, but he seems like another joke of a champ.  I can see him holding up another division, like Leon.
And the main fight on 300 was what?
What happened to usada?
What about Cory ? He was next for the Title 😢 Merab is a beast tho
Who else skipped past Ian muchacha stroking himself on how intlegent he is ?

Why is the audio always so bad for these post fight press conferences?  CMON AUDIO CREW, YOU WORK FOR THE UFC.  DO BETTER

Didn't GSP take years off and came back and won MW against active Bisping?
Did he sign the bonus cheque before the Costa Robert fight?
Fight of the night was Dern/lemos? 😂😂😂
“What do you have in that cup there?” Dana’s cup: 👀 Dana: uhhh Dana: an energy drink… a MONSTER
Lemos and dern but not paulo and Whittaker? Ok.
The questions the dude ask.. WTF these guys ask the fucken lamest questions.  Here's one.. How stupid are YOU? Fire those fools

Ufc 300 top 4 fights going to beat tonight's top 4 fights? I don't know if they will or not tonight was crazy good
How is Whittaker and Costa not FOTN?
Some of these questions 🤣🤣🤣 "What do you think of someone else thinking something?" WTF Good on Dana for just saying "WTF are you asking me???"

How did costa and Whittaker not get a bonus
Why yall can't stop crying and admit that Ilia destroyed Volk?
Why dana looks a little wired
