Why is Georgia afraid of Ohio State??🤣🤣🤣  We've beaten them in the playoffs every time we played them🤣🤣🤣
tOSU with a southern accent? hmm
and why does Herbstreet closeout SEC Shorts - can't get Peyton Manning?
I guess this is comedy?
Cute. So who does Ohio State bring in as a motivational speaker on how to beat Michigan? Even if they beat a depleted ND team and win the natty they still have a Michigan problem. 😏
What did GA fans expect after Ole Miss kicked them up and down the field?
ahhhh man, transfer portal? Dats cold from your sponsor. But funny AF. Go Notre Dame and TD Jesus.
When do they give out grades
Why no mention or appearance of the Irish?
Since we’re not good at football anymore can we get SEC shorts for basketball?
Is that crybaby Kirk?
Where was Hope?  Missed opp to have Hope talk about UF, Bama, Ole Miss, etc
Where is Hope? Miss her.
😂 didnt mizzou beat ohio st last year?
Who does anybody else play? UNRANKED TEAMS.
Where was Hope?????
Thanks for the Buckeye appearance. Is there any way to get some SEC Shorts during the off season? You guys are hilarious.
Why is UGA hiding from Ohio St.? 😂
Grades of SEC Colleges when?
The Bacon or Beacon?
Where's was pimp vandy?
What does little Kirk Herbstreet know about beating any SEC schools ever? 0-2 lifetime. No wonder he is such a bitter homer.
Why the heck is Indianapolis out here catching strays.... we dont deserve that.
SEC Shorts, have YOU considered  entering the transfer portal?
Can we get our report cards please go gators
Really?  Using "... early 90's Buffalo Bills" as the symbol of excellence??????  You might want to rethink that one LOL
Has Hope been replaced by Acceptance?  I say No!
when did yall hire the Hawk Tuah girl? 😂
How many times has Ohio choked on the supposed way to the top? Most conferences have one or at the most two competitive games i  a conference season!
What's the deal with the forced Southern accents?
Best qb? I think Lagway is still at Florida
Could we please get rid of the horrible fake accent the blonde tries to use in every other video!?
Your motivational speaker is from OSU? They haven't won a title since 2014 and that appearance was allegedly bought and paid for by Medium 10 commissioner Jim Delaney. Here's to that drought continues and the Luckeyes lose next week.
What happened out there??😂😂
Alabama fan scared of “naysayers”? Oh man yall cooked
man, really bad video to end the year on :( was there a single actual joke in there at all?
Can we please do SEC Shorts for basketball this season? The conference is on fire
Is this the last skit for the season? I would've liked one to celebrate the wins. Florida and Vanderbilt beating former SEC schools Tulane and GA Tech deserves some fun trash talk.
Ohio State? Oh my that hurts. 😢
I’m honestly surprise there was a dig at 90’s Buffalo Bills but no dig at 90’s Nebraska?
Anyone else notice the camera focus was constantly blurring in/out?
Why would Georgia be afraid of OSU? They've never beaten Georgia.
What happened ??????  Nick Saban retired.  In all fairness the SEC is still a LOT deeper than anyone else.
Was Tennessee's hair just super rat-nested, or was that turf tangled up in it? Either way, as a fan of THE Ohio State University, I appreciate the visual thoroughness to the beat-down that was administered what seems like a year ago,
Why do I hear about tOSU's $20M roster, but not Texas' $22M roster?
Why do I expect to see Pimp Vandy at the end of each episode now?
How tough was it to keep Josh out of the 90s Tennessee puffy Starter coat for this skit? XD
How the heck can you do this clip without involving the team that DID beat THE TOUGH OSU (4 times in a row) and Bama (twice in one year) ???
Did Ohio state forgot about 2020 already? 😂
Who's the girl in the suit? She's been one of the best parts of the SEC Shorts this season
Anyone know who that actress, not Tennessee, is?  She's not on the website.
How many tries did you have from the 1 yard line? Ouch 🤣
