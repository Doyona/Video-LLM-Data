Does the show ever get “serious”?
The hell happened to crunchyroll ?? spy x family, mha and lots of other anime episode still not released yet
Are they pulling a jujutsu Kaisen where half of the seasons arcs are full of wholesome stuff and then the rest of the action just gonna be tragedy

Is this the first episode? Because I've heard from other people that the first episode isn't his backstory but just filller
What time does this come out?
When is this and MHA airing on Crunchyroll?
What happened to my happy family time?
Do you need premium to see the newest?
I wonder if we'll ever learn his real name. I'm sure it starts with either L or R, since they're the same letter/sound in Japanese, and when using an alias, some people pick a name that starts with the same letter as their real name to trick their own minds into responding to it better. And all of his fake names have started with either L or R.
How many times have you watched this? Me: YES
