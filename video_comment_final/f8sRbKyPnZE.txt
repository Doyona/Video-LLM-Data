2:20 who is he? I love his voice so much
Am I crazy or the tone up stuff they put these boys are not blended well up to their forehead... or is it the lighting? I'm sorry I can't help but notice it
who did jaehee makeup... bruhhhh didnt blend the neck and face
Why they are looking like SIMS 😭😭
the powder on their faces is very white, why SM??? I see other parts that are not covered by powder such as the ears and the back of the neck are very different in color. Even though they are already handsome and naturally white.
what's up with them looking so pale?? and some of them are uneven like it's either they look like sakuya pale from head to toe or like jaehee and riku there face are so pale but it didn't match up there neck what's up with the make up/ or filter? they made them looked like a ghost🥲🥲🥲  edit: no hate tho... but its just that it doesn't look right i know they need heavy make up when being on stage but it looks too much😅 and why do i feel like they made them use the same thing as aespa used that spray that made them look like a ghost😅 i mean look at sakuya😂
How can a group be this cute and refreshing? stan Nct Wish 💚
is this a new dance content?? the editing was so pretty and it highlighted very well the song's vibe and also the members visuals ❤
