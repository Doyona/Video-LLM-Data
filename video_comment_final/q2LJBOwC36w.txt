Why  doesn’t Drug chest Connor fight in America where the Big money is, Is it because they have stricter drug testing.

How come the British guys are giving 100%>While our US fighters take smoke breaks😂
bro what is this mexican brawling I'm seeing ?😂
8-4 was criminal. has a  Ben Shalom fighter ever lost a decision? that was a draw or 7-5 at most
Yes Eubank Jr. did win, but unanimous? Come on that can't be, that was clearly a split decision.

I'm confused. Can someone tell me what rounds had highlights??
Cracking fight,when's the rematch??

Does Connor have a granite jaw or did all that weight cutting from Eubank save him 😂
3 minutes of highlights from a 36 minute fight? DAZN what are we doing???
Was it even for a belt or just a grudge fight.
This intensity was beyond. How did they not run out of stamina ?
Why was snr there? I thought he said it was a disgrace. That they havent spoken for years? So it was all pony....
Bro how is the highlight only 3 minutes? This fight was fking crazy
Fight of the year? Is this how boxing has fallen? Neither are world class, neither are the champion of anything. I'd rather watch 2 matids eating eash other.
Unanimous??? I didn’t see the fight but from what I heard on the radio it didn’t sound unanimous
I don't understand when both fighters want to knock the other spark out and then it goes the distance the "winner" flopping to the floor like it was their life's goal seems a bit backwards.  In that situation I get emotions are a part of it but I'd just put my glove up and walk off because the goal was to knock them out and not win on points right?
Is this the fight a of the year ?  Thank messieurs for that great show.
This is Benn fighting clean???? I need to look up his highlights when he got popped bc that man looked like an android on a mission
How can you confidently post such a biased highlight video 😂
What is a beauty dance...
Is Eubank still training with Roy ? He reminded me of him at certain moments of the fight
Why only three minutes DAZN?
I had it 9-3 Eubank   You need to watch the fight back if you think it was close or a draw ? 😂🤦🏻‍♂️  I thought the fight was very entertaining & full of drama  but technically it was  poor & very scrappy.  In other news I’m Buzzing for Jnr & absolutely over the moon Eddie, matchroom & team benn lost every mental battle &  the fight they don’t deserve anything apart from the battering they got ! 🥊😬😂
Two strong chins or two weak punchers?
I’m only watching the highlights but how did Eubank win??
I didn't see the whole fight, but seeing this clip, how did Chris win? Can someone explain to me?
Fight of the year?
How are they in the same weight class?
What was the weight discrepency? Ben seemed much the active one
Are these people in the same weight class?
I haven't watched the full match but couldn't this have been a draw?
Curious...anyone else score the fight unanimous?
Just wondering why Eubank Jr wore Winning Gloves?  I swear their 10oz gloves are SO pillowy you can use them on the bag AND spar and your fists take absolutely no damage, and neither does anyone else lol.    They are for fragile hands much like Ringsides are, but a bit stiffer in the padding in front.  Why not use Campeons or Reyes or some such?  Everlast Powerlocks if they still use them also work well.
How much did Chris take home
Dang they really kept the legacy going?
Rematch in December at 160lbs?
How did Ben lose this ??? 😅
When Canelo will do something like this?
Did the right man won or was it a really close fight that could’ve gone either way?
Was this an episode of Dragon Ball Z!!!? Dang ! they was throwing them Hands lol
Can any of these guys beat canelo ?
Can we get part 2 please? A rematch??
What was benn record??
Only 3 minutes of highlights?
Why do DAZN fighters always lose. Do you think it's karma for using such deplorable people as Eddie Hearn to do business with?
Come on dazn.. 3 minute highlights, what is this a pbc event?? You can't claim its fightbof the year if the whole fight wasn't action packed.
Absolute brilliant fight. Can i ask everyone. Considering the difference in weight divisions they had to change and age/experience. If that was a consideration in the total outcome does anyone think benn deserved the win? Just a "IF" question
Did they touch gloves at the beginning
Who tf does the ref think he is
Are they in the same weight class? He looks twice the dudes size, what's this?
Did Eddie put these highlights together? Totally missing out every round Conor lost. Embarrassing
Why is this highlight showing Benn won? Chris is a lot bigger than Benn. If they were the same size, Chris would get KOed
Was this a catchweight contest? These two should never have been in the same ring
Was this fight clean? I don't think so. Ben kept the pressure on and then shook the eubank a few times. A close win for Ben I think.
How is this the same weight class?
Benn looked like an overcooked omelette.  Did he train back in Spain or in a tanning bed?
What were the scores?
Only 3 minutes? Man Turki gonna have full fight on Monday 😂
Ben is too wild where’s the jab to set up punches where’s the coach ?
Eubank vs Benn in a thrilling, dramatic fight where Eubank manages to take it? What year is it again?
Eubankjr grinded out an arduous points decision against a blown up welterweight.Seriously is eubank fighting Canelo next? hahah.Canelo smashes eubank up,easy work.Thats if he wants the fight which i doubt
Why do referees sometimes INSIST on that glove touch?  This is a boxing match; not a gift giving contest.
Fight of the year?
