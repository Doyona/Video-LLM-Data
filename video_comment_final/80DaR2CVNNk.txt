How many plastic surgeries the host got?
How on earth did the USA survive so long when both President Biden and VP Harris were both completely off their rocker? Thank god for DJT 😅
What the hell happened that and administration paid, encouraged, advertised and spread the word for all to come to America.  Criminals and terrorists alike. All in the name of potential votes. Also not much doubt they got some. And they say this administration is the one doing the wrong thing.  These people are crazy.
How can someone talk so much without saying anything?
How do u never answer a question with real down to the core answers. And only point fingers and only say ur basis is that people have said. Not that stats or statistics have said. Never give a real answer and people still support this bs. It's straight bs with no real answer. How could anybody support this hypocrisy.
How can anyone believe her when she did nothing during her administration.
Boy. Did we dodge a bullet, or what?

😂😂why is the comedy? This is better than SNL I feel like I'm watching the Dave Chappelle skit
Is this real?
Why is there a common tactic of talking over people by some Trump supporters? Is this done on purpose? If what they are saying is true then why do they have to talk over people? Everytime it happens.
What’s the difference between Biden and Kamala? Biden had a brain, he just lost as he got older, meanwhile, Kamala never had a brain in the first place😂

Did she mention the children of the community?
Have the dems even watched this? Sheesh.
When did the imagination system become broken? Can anyone tell me? It worked for years and years but now somehow it is deemed broken. I say this is a false argument. It’s only broken in a sense that the democrats can’t get these immigrants legalized fast enough so they can vote for Socialism!
Where was she on the night of the election when Trump won and she never came out to address it and her supporters!!
lol she gets mad that he's interrupting her RAMBLING and NON ANSWERS. He asks a simple question, how many immigrants were released? She speaks for 20 seconds and doesn't say a number. This whole administration is a joke. Zero transparency. Zero accountability.

How many people she blow to become vice president in the first place? She’ll probably blame trump for that too what a disaster of an interview
who is the first time oversea voter who voted for Trump here?
Do all the Democrats do is talk?? What is she even talking about?
Can we grill TRUMP on gun laws? Democrats have this weakness but Republicans have their on weakness. I just pray both can come together to do the right thing on both issues.

How are those who don't have Internet going to see those documents

How do you have penalties for a legal crossing when you’re allowing everybody to come in?
what a disgusting disrespectful interviewer. There are ways to ask question to make a point. he acts aggressive and took it over the top to not let her answer - beyond misleading. People wake up and use common sense- this is ridiculous and embarrassing for all of us American people.
"So, what are you turning the page from?" 😂 That instant when he fried her... 🤣🤣🤣
Why ACCEPT depravity from him but EXPECT perfection from Kamala? We are better than this.
How did this video get over 100,000 comments and not the ones that debunked the January 6 narrative from the liberal media or the ones of the presidential debate?
sooo back to the 1st question... what's the number?
Was this a Saturday Night Live skit!😂
What about Americans that don't have a license, scumbags Harris
What was Harris doing all the time she was in office?
Why does she talk like a recording?  Why democrats like to hear the same stale rhetoric?  Everyone can repeat her words by now. She will do nthing for 4 years - she has no solution. She's the one playing politicl games. Good thing Bret keep bringing in content.
who will vote for this trainwreck????
Just how many times did she mention Donald Trump during this interview? & what law do we have on the books that says male prison inmates are entitled to funding for transgender surgeries?
What a horrid interviewer this Fox&friends guy is!!  How rude to ask a question -- then just talk right over Harris. Irritating--
How can  someone talk so much and not talk with answering common sense talk
All the question he ask her she didn't answer 80% of it, she is after Trump. Every answer let me talk about Trump is Trump he ask her? Infact this proves to me that inwardly she is full of lies.
My only question is why did we have to wait for another dem to get in office for changes? She keeps saying our plan..... your plan has failed us the last 4 years.
If Iran is americas biggest enemy, why is she giving billions of American workers tax dollars to them.??????????
How did this clown get so far 🤔

What gaslighting this man did to this woman?  I don’t care what side you’re on but if you care about people, you will see that this dude was messed up.
Strengthen small business?? This administration can’t even send a single mom on low income her fkn tax return. She’s full of 💩.
Where are the children pedos ??????😮
A better follow up question to Kamala's non-apology to those families would be, "How would you feel if that was YOUR (step)daughter who was murdered due to your border policy? Could you forgive yourself?"  Saying "Sorry for your loss" is NOT an apology because you're not holding yourself accountable for your actions that led to their murders.
Why do you spend the majority of her responses describing and lame ting over Trump??? Just tell us whet YOU are going to do, how YOU ate going to help US, talk to us about US Kamala. We're listening...we keep waiting to hear.
Who is voting for this lady?
Why do we have to take all these immigrants why do they get to pick and choose what country they pick asylum in
Q: Kamala, could you explain to us what a coffee mug is used for? Kamala: Let me be very clear... Donald Trump.
How did she make it so far 😮
Where’s the language barrier? Is it because she doesn’t understand any questions?
Did she answer any of the questions ?
Does Kamala know what “clear” means?
The question, why are 50% of people following Trump, but the  Washington Post has counted over 30K +  lies he continues to  do? Are this people dumb or  like  most Cult followers, you don't ask questions you just follow. Unfortunately most Christian regions are doing the same thing. Are the following the word of God from  the Bible or are they following the practices of leaders in their church organizations ?  (Just do a little research in  the topical section of the Bible and let God reveal the true)
What actually ARE your policies?????
Why can't she just answer the question?!!
How can someone talk so much yet not actually say anything?
Why people saying she got no answers when she talkin about bills and ideas she trying to to push?
When asked a question this stupid foolish vice president only talks about Donald Trump.
If fentanyl is such a big issue why don’t they give morphine anymore? They are administering fentanyl to patients willingly.
Did she answer any question?
Yall see how she twitching and glitching??? What is she hiding 😂😂👴🏿🍿
Don't ask questions as a journalist if you only plan to interrupt and not allow them to complete their answer. This is a terrible interview. She wasn't allowed to fully speak.  Baiting questions at best and when she tried to answer, she was interrupted the moment they didn't like how the response was going.  I mean she had to even call them out on cherry picking videos and clips just to make them look bad and Trump better.  The bias definitely showed.....smh.
Is her pants on fire?
Gotcha Question: How many illegal immigrants were let into the country under Biden?  Better question:  What is the measurement of illegal immigration? Is it people that illegally cross the southern border only, people that are here illegally in total, or  is there someone who monitors the overall process of illegal immigration that scores its status?
Did we think she will end WAR?
Why does this guy keep interrupting her
what's been happening the last 4 years then to get Judges, support etc?
Why can’t she admit she dropped the ball? 🤦🏼‍♂️
Free tuition? While I'm $26,000 in the hole and many others have it worse 🤦🏾‍♂️. Please let's stop this nonsense
Don't all of the hardcore MAGA people love how delusional G-PA Trump has tossed lil Vance under the bus, making sure he doesn't say anything else so stupid?
Where has she been?
“Madame Vice President where do you stand on the most important issues facing the nation today?”  “Google it.”
Did you notice how this garbage changes voice depending on who she is lying to? Is this supposed to be her nasal white Karen voice? Seriously I haven’t seen her suck this bad since she was under Willie Brown 😂😂😂😂
Is it me, or did she not answer a single question?
If Joe Biden was doing such a GREAT JOB, why did he get pushed out and she was installed??   Kamalie is full of 💩
Where are the numbers?
Is it just me or does it look like she's listening from an ear piece.
How can we elect a person that won’t answer any question
“Do you support using taxpayer dollars to fund gender transition of prisoners?” “I will follow the law🤓☝️” -Kamala 2024
Is only me or we only see Kamala supporters on her social medial only and no where else.
What is her "plan" aside from spending taxpayer money to subsidize people who cannot afford housing who will eventually default on their home loans because they cannot afford their housing? We have seen this before in the 80's.  Guess who profits? The corporations like Blackrock who come in and buy up all those properties for pennies on the dollar. The American taxpayer is the looser in all of this.
she still didn't answer the first question ???
How many coconuts do we think she lost when she fell off the tree?
Trump rumbles when answering questions so?

She cannot even answer a question on topic. Yall democratic voters are supporting that? Everyone of you need help.
What a rude prick! I gave up on the 2nd question / 2nd interruption.
So what’s the plan? Why can’t she say? Why dodge and deflect every question with no clear answer?
Did she almost say “hotel” instead of cartel?
Why doesnt she ever answear the fukin question
Kamala Harris is a joke. Does she really know what she is saying???

Is it just me or is she taking a page from Hilarys book on lying because make her white and add the hair boom 💥
did she answer a single question?
What kind of apology was that to a grieving mother? Apologizing for how the mother feels instead of apologizing for what Kamala did to CAUSE her to feel this way! Take accountability!
Why is that Americans think that a political leader is automatically wrong just because they can't give a 3-word solution to a complex political issue?
She wants to fund taxpayer gender transition surgeries for prisoners??????????????   She will follow the law because she will make it the law.  She's demented.
When are we all going to stand up against this 'acting', she just says a whole load of nothing.. the same as our UK politicians

What have you actually achieved or completed successfully in your previous 4 years in office!
Why is he not asking her if she worked in mcdonalds?
Why does he keep interupting her after asking her a question? Granted, she seems to go on and on and on before actually answering questions, but still.. he interviews like a man arguing in a doomed relationship.
So Sad that she can't answer any question clearly, sure supporting here there where is the money for all this plans comming from? Let me guess more taxes out of my paycheck
The way she speaks is exhausting—she stretches out her words and uses ones that don’t even seem to fit, just to fill time. It’s unbearable to listen to, almost physically painful. Am I the only one who feels this way, or do others agree?
Wait…. She does know she was Vice President and Joe Biden was President the last 4 years right??  All this crap is on her and her administration.
Whose mouthpiece was this? hmmm let me guess!!
Why are there so many bots here ?? Trump supporters ??
Where is the $ going to come from for the $25k down payment to 1st time home buyers? I hope it’s not going to come from higher federal and state taxes and a cut to current homeowners deductions.  In other words, I hear great ideas at the 50k level, but no clear details…
Do other countries with social healthcare approve and pay for gender reassignment surgery?  I hope to high Heaven this is not passed in the US!  My tax dollars shouldn’t cover this! Otherwise one can argue why fed taxes shouldn’t cover any elective surgery!
Why does B can’t answer a simple question
Where are all of the Kamala Harris supporters in these comments to stand up for her?? I hear crickets 😂😂

im confused, she mumbled about the border bill that trump didn't like but been doing what the last four years to try to pass it? she is in office and could start making good on her promises already. this would be the only way she could get elected
Why is she never answering the questions?  4 years, in office and still no actions.
Dalton's supermayor mark 2?
She never answered his question  professionally. Plus, does she have a speech coach?  She could be a judge somewhere at the corner but to run USA?? She doesn’t even know how to enunciate English. She just doesn’t own what she is saying. Just platitudes in slow pace.
Who ordered a word salad?

Why would anyone even consider voting for a presidial candidate (Trump) who clearly suffers from severe narcissistic personality disorder and is delusional, unstable, has psychopathic tendencies and is a pathological liar?
Who exactly is stopping her from being clear? Other than herself that is
Okay so being honest if you were forced to take a shot everytime the word Donald and/or Trump is said, how far are you making it?
So, MAGAs don't think inflation was due to covid and insane spending? So, I guess Trump's record of worst job losses wasn't because of covid either?
How can you ask someone a question and then not let them answer?
What is wrong with this mans face????

How many crimes have been committed by Americans?
I asked AI if Trump is a psychopath?  A psychopath, lacks a conscience, empathy, and remorse. Famous psychopaths include serial killers like Ted Bundy and fictional characters like Hannibal Lecter.   While opinions vary, some experts have described Donald Trump as exhibiting traits associated with psychopathy:  Malignant Narcissism:  Trump displays pathological lying, obsession with violence, and manipulability when praised.  He appears indifferent to others’ suffering and holds anti-social values.  Trump’s destructive behavior and false narratives influenced his supporters, leading to shared delusions and extreme actions.  The followers, often dealing with societal stress or developmental wounds, yearn for a parental figure and become needy.  Psychopathy Traits:  A test ranked Trump’s psychopathy traits higher than Hitler’s and just below Idi Amin and Henry VIII.
Where have those plans been for the last 4 years?
Did she call him, "Ben?"
Finally a “journalist” that has the stones to ask the real substantive questions we tax payers are asking! So, will you continue with this new line of accountability questioning Bret or cower to the powers that make your electronic deposits?
And how did Iran get the nuclear arms that they now possess? The USA gave them the nuclear arms.
And how does Kamala explain 20k Haitians in Springiield, OH?
Where is the money going to come from for all her fantastical policies???
Your kids could have a day with Trump or Harris, which one would you choose? I know which one I think would give them fun!
Eighty pages of policy??? She knows most people won’t read all that.
Doesn't answer one question just keeps dancing around the answer. How cam any think she is presidential material?
Good lord! Does she even know how to answer one single question? Most of his questions only required a yes or no answer; not a deflective filibuster.
You reversed Trump's policies as soon as you got into office, was that a mistake?  We put forward a bill and Trump stopped it.  They put forward a bill 3 years after they reversed all Trump's policies and allowed over 6 million illegal immigrants in.
Mrs Vice President, why are you letting so many Haitian immigrants into our swing states? To change the vote in your favor? You are changing hard working American lives for the worse, in these areas.
I wonder if in 2040 American TV personalities will still look like they are from the 80's wallstreet era 😂
21:13 "When did you first notice Joe Biden's mental facilities had been diminshed?" Kamala: Deer in headlights, followed by dishonest word salad and Trump, Trump, Trump.
Why is he cutting her off and being rude, let the lady talk
Grilled?  How about finally pinned down without the cover of the liberal media?
is she ok like that? i wanna ask to her supporters.donald looks dangerous but also honest. and harris looks salad.
Are we supposed to guess what her policies are? She dodges everything.
What's this guy's problem? Why does he keep cutting her off.
Did Brett's producers: A) make an honest mistake, or B) purposefully used the wrong clip to antagonize Harris, or C) purposefully sabotage his interview?
did a single coherent word come out of her mouth?
Did not answer a single question clearly.  The body languages just screaming that she is not even comfortable to talk about anything  especially the truth.
Is it technically a “real interview” if the person conducting it talks more than the person he’s interviewing, constantly interrupts, speaks over them, and doesn’t let them finish a sentence throughout the whole procedure?
Can she answer a question with using trumps name?😂😂😂😂
Grilled??? 😂😂😂 he don’t let her talk,,, wish to see Trumpy on CNN but he has no balls
How do you plan on paying for 1500 more boarder patrol agents.
Do you mean the rhetoric that the democrats started spewing when Trump ran for president in 2016? That is what started the divide in the country in the first place!
Why is faux news still being called a "news" station? Didn't you admit in court what liars you are?
Why doesn’t he let her talk tho??
What BULL$HIT!!!!!  She went out of her way to NOT answer a question. She played the “… let me finish…” again  saying.
Take responsibility for what happened in your administration? Does;nt look like anytime soon she will be taking responsibilities for there policies.
How long would her nose be if she’s Pinocchio   Holy cow I wouldn’t trust her to house sit for me
I AM WONDERING! If ENGLISH IS HER FIRST LANGUAGE???   Because SHEs NOT GETTING EVEN ONE QUESTION RIGHT ! Lol  TRUMP 2024 🎉
So what are your plans Kamala?
What a politician... Every time Brett tried asking a hard-hitting question she tried to ramble on and not allow him to ask it.
Why would you ask questions if you won’t let her answer? 😂
why is Donald Trump from the past interviewing Kamala Harris?
Why reverse the executive orders?
is he allergic to letting the person he's interviewing speak?
Who was it that call 19-24 yr olds stupid??
How can Americans take this candidate seriously? 2:19
Who came after SNL?
Why did she agree to go on Fox News???
Hey Bret, how many times did Trump ask u to blend over and on your knees?
Why did kamala wait till election time Trump had it fixed and Biden Harris undid everything Trump did on the border
Thats a person who is asking a questions you want us to vote for you ??? God in heaven 🙏 help is is she is elected all she has doing is babbling
Typical Fox. Ask questions that insinuate one thing and cut off your respondent before they get a chance to respond.  She has not answered a single question uninterrupted. Did you notice that? Biased little #%*#.  American does not need a convict for president. Fox wouldn’t know the meaning of ‘fact’ so it’s just wasted on them. Time to turn over a NEW page.
Why interview someone if you won't let them speak
What is wrong with this guys face?
What a whiny evil betch. All she can do is talk about DJ just to avoid answering a question that she doesn’t have a proper answer for.
Man democrats dropped the ball installing her. I get that she’s technically an incumbent but when the country is unhappy why would they ever choose an incumbent VP over a new dem? Either way I’m glad they did 😂
How are Trumptards this stupid? If their darling baby donald was asked these questions, they would be calling it fake news!  Pathetic.
Who is this insufferable little child of a woman?!
So, the plan is not to prevent crime, but to have faster condemnation? Did I get that right?
Where’s the word salad??? 😉🙃🙂🤪🫢🫢🫢🫢😮 How about those peal earring’s…
@22:00 the same national security that said hunters laptop was Russian miss information? Those people just keep thinking we are blind def and stupid.
Why is he not letting her speak? 😄 Really insecure interviewer
What is your plan?
so if i get a question and my answer is explaining that question again, that counts as an answer? it’s easy to be US president
Who's here after SNL?
Can she keep her hands to herself for two seconds???? 🤮
How does she pay for that.  Print more money.
A new way forward?  Marxist much?
Brett: asks question   Kamala:  “I will follow the law”  Brett:  so you aren’t going to answer the question, then?  Kamala:  “I will follow the law”   What a joke lol
Bro like, why is she MAD doing this interview?
Didn't She have that guy locked up for being a "threat" to Planned Parenthood? Seizing all the evidence of black market sales of aborted fetuses??? Hmmm 🤔
How did this idiot even get this far
Why is this edited, removing Bret Baier's deliberate use of wrong clips? Bret Baier is a piece of $hit. 💩
If Israel is allowed to defend itself, why does she keep condemning Israel's "treatment of Palestinians"?
How you know she only watches MSNBC's clips and not his actual speeches...
Were there any photos or preferably videos of Kamala taken within the 30 minutes after the interview? Several times she looked like she was fixing to cry.
Yeah, but you're not stopping it, are you?
Does she not realize he has  been the president before? How dangerous was life then compared to now? Why was that question not asked??
How do you answer a question with an answer is not at all related to the question that is originally presented.
Did Trump win the election in 2020 and Trump has been our president for the last 4 years or did Biden/Harris win and they have been the official declared president and vice president?
Did they find out Who those Liberals are that are Infiltrating as  Republicans????   Why is Nobody worried about this???  Their sneaking in the front door to bring our party down from the Inside!!!!
13:41  turn the page? She's the current page right now I think we definitely need to turn the page
Why is she screaming?
13:19 Who is we? Is there more than one president?
Does anyone believe this Dunce?!
Why?????? Do you want , prisoner's  to have" transgender, surigies , with Tax payers money! We the people said Hell no!!
Could anybody answer the question for me why is the United States is so loyalty to Israel when they're not loyal to the American  people where they risking all I lives and money to help the synagogue of Satan 🙏
Does any truth ever come out of her mouth?
Why are her interviews so hard to watch?
Can't Dems figure out she will never answer a question.   And has no idea about anything
Does anyone know how to tell if a democrat is lying?? Their lips are moving
Why can’t she talk about her policies though? She is cringe
What exactly is "broken" with our immigration system? Specifically...? Will never get an answer. Eff emotions, quit breaking the law. We don't owe anybody anything.
Who else here fell out of a coconut tree? 🖐️
How many lies can she spin on!
Why did she cook, though?
Who ordered the chopped Kamala?!
Ok, what are the options?
What did we learn..... Nothing???
Did she just fall out of the coconut tree 😂
How come Trump is hiding and won't do interviews with anybody, and won't debate again? He knows she'll wipe the floor with him Again. He wouldn't show up to an NRA interview, he wouldn't show up for the 60 Minutes interview, won't debate again, that's weak. She's fierce and strong and has my vote, I don't vote for cowards and weak little men.
I cant watch this stupidity. Is she really having a degree?.
Is this a democracy? When did it change? Thought we were a republic? Shes like arguing with someone whos on drugs
Is Bret trying the oranatang look. I  am looking at the white circles around his eyes.
Is this a comedy skit? Total upside-down world. Hilarious!
Crazy how she keeps dodging every single question, as if she can’t give a single good answer. I wonder why’s that?
WHAT DO ISRAEL AND IRAN WAR HAVE TO DO WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE???
Most of us were raised in a middle class family. So what’s her f$&king point?
Why did Trump spent 40 minutes on the last town hall dacing to music? He's he unfit?
Do you regret letting the immigrants into the country at the beginning of your administration? She couldn't answer that question.
How many immigrants have you and your administration let into the country? She couldn't answer that question
DID ANYONE COUNT HOW MANY TIMES SHE DAID THE NAME "TRUMP"..?SHE is SCARED amd petrified.... Sounds to me she was ENDORSING TRUMP RATHER THAN VILAFYING HIM...THANK U COMMIE LA...KEEP UP SAYING TRUMP SO MORE PEOPLE VOTE FOR HIM
For those of us that don't regularly watch Fox News, are all interviews just the host talking over the guest?
Did she even answer one complete question.
Why can't she answer any questions?
How long after being named "border czar" did it take to visit the border
who is this guy no respect lol
So what are YOU going to do!??! Stop pointing fingers! So what is YOUR solution. Please tell us!
That woman just cant admit to ANYTHING... Did she forget about the 90 executive orders that she and Biden thought were a good idea????
Does she secretly love Donald? She wouldn't stop talking about him. Wow.
Before Asian Hate?
I’m confused why she still tries to be president?? She’s had to be threatened to become the next puppet.
Is she a robot !?
Do we really want to have government dictating who this country is?
Is anybody else just sick and tired of candidates that spend their ENTIRE election and BILLIONS of dollars just tearing one another down instead of focusing their actual attention on the country where it is SUPPOSED TO BE?!!!
Why doesn’t he let her finish a sentence? He can fact check all he wants after she completes a thought. Terrible interviewer ..
Why so defensive hmmm 🤔
Kamala Harris, Jerry Lundegaard.   Any difference?
If I bet in Vegas that she would say "unburdened", but she actually said "burdened", do I still get paid???
The experiment? Cloning? And left him brain dead partially? Oh my
Is the real problem being able to afford a house or is the problem taxes and insurance. 46% of my check goes to insurance and taxes. That’s almost half  it’s sad to work and automatically have to give up half for what??? Taxes you never get and insurance you never use
Did she even answer a single question?
Why did Bret Baier even let her talk? He should have kept interrupting, so she couldn’t complete even a sentence… sad
Penalties on illegal crossings… So are they gonna use their free debit card money to pay those penalties? What money are they paying this with?
Just want to ask “is there any loyalty in anyone anymore”? Stands to reason the admin wld be different, but to say “it will not be a continuation of the Joe Biden admin”, even though nothing negative was SPOKEN-the tone threw him underneath the bus
Why can't see just answer a question???
Would you buy a used car from this woman?
y does he interrupt her EVERY TIME the starts to fumble?!?!?    donkey
How did he manage to keep a straight face?
...btw, her right ear? Every video, her left side is in view, maybe..............she has an earpiece...?
How can things be someone’s fault who isn’t in office?
How tf is Harris winning the elections. Ah here go
Can you really believe or Trust someone who confuses Reproduction vs. Termination?
Here's what I don't get, she's politician, politicians are often known as prolific liars, how on Earth is she so bad at this!? Like that aside, she clearly is trying the pivot to Trump tactic, but she is so transparent that surely nobody can take her seriously?
Anyone noticed her wearing the same ear rings ever since becoming the Democrat presidential candidate ?  She used to wear many different types... now it's those ones that look alot like the wifi earpiece ear rings !!!
❗️❗️Wait... is she wearing the same earrings that she wore on the debate with Donald Trump, that has in ear monitor??
I’m not even voting for her but man, you could respectfully allow her to answer YOUR questions..   Isn’t this interview techniques 101?
ok right Kamala really?  the question is simple. why have you not CLOSED the border period , until suitable resouces and screening can be put into place..
Did not answer the question vote Trump
There is something wrong with the guy's face.  yall noticed?
Anyone elses comments being censored by corrupt google?
Is there a more stupid woman on this planet? Tough question. Naturally, the answer is to blame Trump. 😂😂
She was an AG?😮
Trump baby!   What even is this? Is this a satire interview?
If he’s unfit why wasn’t he removed as Biden was removed?
Why is he so rude?
She had (and has) power for three years and counting. Why couldn't she make changes? That question is her nemesis.
Anybody knows where I can find a video where Bret Baier is apologizing for showing her the wrong clip? It does not appear on their channel and it is also absent from the description - there does not appear any reference to the correction anywhere so I cannot prove it to somehow who questions that it actually happened. Thanks.
Soo what is her solution  to the problem?
How much money does her campaign spend on her many ads I have to see all of the time?!
Question: they endorsed Trump and said you're a failure at border security  Kamala: They're frustrated. I get it. They work hard  Um? 😂 that's not an answer. Yes. Yes they are working very very hard.
How can anyone listen to her and still vote for her?
Did Kamala forget that we are a REPUBLIC, not a Democracy?
What's Joe doing?
Why does it seem like she is pausing between every few words as if she's being fed the words??????????? HMMMMMM?
Who is paying for the 25,000.00  down payment Harris wants to give all these people?
Where is Trump’s interview now?
Why does trump and the left hate each other so much
Why does she always raise her voice pitch when talking? Is she trying to seem more sincere? She is such a fake. I can't believe anyone actually wants to vote for her.
What does she know about taking responsibility for anything that happens in her administration
Where are we gonna get the money for all this stuff, Kamala???  We are at an all-time high, $35 Trillion in debt ($7 trillion more this past year... on what???).  The Dems are just terrible.
Do you think your sorry will bring back her daughter
Does she hear herself when she talks??
She couldn't ANSWER EVEN 1... EVEN ONE QUESTION ⁉️ What the heck!!?
What we have here is a butcher turning heart    docter?????
What about Deportation?! That’s what I did not hear either of them talk about.
They had an inflation reduction act??????  Could have fooled me
Did she call Brett Ben when answering the immigration question? 🤦‍♀️
Why she hasnt done all of the great things she would do yet??
okay… so what are your fresh and new ideas without mentioning donald trump and giving handouts?
is this comedy? or serious
Do u think regular American people have time to read your 87 pages policies? You just do have policies or you have no idea
Are you here talk about Trump to American people or your policy?
What is wrong with this woman
Did they tell her that this is her interview not trumps?
I have one question to ask.  Does Washington represent you and your concerns?
Ms harris what is 2+2? Her: buu bu bu but d ddd Donald trump bad!
Has anyone actually checked into how many cases she prosecuted? She has a failed record and failed policies.  She has taken no responsibility for any of her administration
Why does she keep blaming Trump when he's not been president for the last four years
What’s your plan then??
Why does he ask questions and then not let her respond? Did he learn his interview skills at Trump U?
Wow... that's a lot of words... so it must mean _something_ important, right? Quick question, are politicians allowed to give 1-word answers to direct questions, or is that prohibited by the rules of the "Who Wants To Be A President" gameshow? This season's been good, but next season... da-bomb...literally...
can you answer a question without mentioning trump? Lets be clear, I was raised in a middle class family and its all trump's fault.
Does anyone get tired of the fake accent she puts on when talking about immigration?
Turn the page? O want a flip book full of 8 years of Kamala.
Do you know what I'm talking about, cause I don't 😂
Where’s the evidence of Trump saying don’t pass this Bill for election purposes ? With everything going on with impeachments, court cases etc. I don’t think Trump would have been thinking that far ahead even if he wanted to do that. The republican party wanted something better and Democrats wouldn’t do it.
Does anyone watch this and still plan to vote for Kamala Harris?
Can she ever actually answer a question
Why is her hair not moving on the right side of her head? Please, guarantee she has a mic In her ear..
lol what does think that we’re stupid?
How much did Brett pay for all of his plastic surgery?
Can she give a clear answer to any question? The whole interview she said practically nothing...
Wow she is so fake, she didn’t answer a single question she was asked so what’s the point of going to an interview?
Why is she so whiny? That raised high pitch tone of voice does not inspire confidence.
How does it feel to get a taste of her own medicine?!? She couldnt stand being fact checked and called out in her ridiculous BS. And a "moderator"/interviewer who isnt on her side! How does it feel Kamala??
Why on earth support transgender?
Does she only own 1 pair of earrings? She literally always has it on like an earpiece or like a part of a superhero outfit.
What the hell is she always doing with her hands. Acting like Obama.
How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood? My mother raised me middle class and so now I'm entitled to everything cause Donald Trump
Who can believe thos  corporations????
Why isn't she answering the questions?? Even one question wasn't answered.
What a liar she evades the answer but she never makes a point
Did she even answer a single question in those 26 minutes?
Actually what are you talking about?😂
Any former democrats/independents voting for Trump this year ?
Where is trump hiding
What was n what could have been,circle back, now I'm black, now I'm not, word salads are 95%off right now
How anyone can vote for someone who willy refuses to answer what they actually intend to do as president is beyond mind blowing?
Can you imagine Trump giving up presidency when his decline kicks in?   He is a toxic old man who has poisoned our country
Why do you ask her a question and interrupt her ? She's not finished talking for god's sake. When you don't like her answer, you interrupt her.  This is why I hate Fox News ! You suck ! I'm here to support her.  I'm even more convinced how fake Fox News is.. She is so brave for coming here to talk with you and to bring reason and truth but you keep interrupting her. I'm turning the page now because Fox News suck ! Bye
Is she unable to answer yes or no questions?
Why do we need a new bill to solve the border issue?  What bill was in effect when Trump was in charge of the border?
OK, but what’s wrong with his face? Shifty eyes and Botox? Eew.
so.... I watched whole video..... What is her plan?
How disrespectful is the fact that she is not even allowed to answer questions without being interrupted.
Crossed arms. Crosses legs. She is uncomfortable and most importantly not confident. They didn't bother to coach her on body language? This is a FOX interview that was 20 mins. She is going to perform better against actual adversaries?? Unbelievable but then again Biden is still sitting in office.
What is wrong mentality of this woman she's not well?
Would you buy from a carmaker who only bad mouths the competitor's models but offers no information at all on his own cars, not even a mock up, let alone the mechanics and specifications?
This lady doesnt answer 1 question. Zero accountability. So whos voting for her and please tell why???
Why can’t  she ever answered a simple question and have to blame it on her opponent??
So, when Mike Pence was vice president did he have more power than trump? 🤔 I swear these trumpsters are so ignorant, foolish and immature
The burden from the last decade?? You were part of the worst part!!!
Boy he just couldn’t stop talking over her. Could it be because she made total sense and he didn’t want that to show through? So glad she was composed and kept going, ignoring his rude interruptions.
DID SHE EVER ANSWER THE QUESTION??????????? 4 YEARS SHE DIDNT CARE NOW SHE DOES 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
The burden from the last decade?? You were part of the worst part!!!
You knowdoes she realize the buyers won’t get the 25k but the seller will which will increase housing?
How does she not understand the 2 year difference between when she deleted policies and then asked for loaded Bills?
She's not serious about the affair of the people, but rather beautiful words saying nothing. Where is her teleprompter?
Why does she go into robot mode when asked about iran?? As if she is repeating verbatim what is being told to her in her ear piece😮😮😂
Has anyone seen this woman answer a question directly? Like even once? All she does is talk about Trump. Lady if you want anyone's vote... you gotta actually answer a single critical question...
Ah, it’s about a book … about an island? …with treasure on it?
Is the timestamp between 21:10 - 21:30 called a Freudian slip?????????????? Who saw the movie Manturian candidate?
If you were interviewing someone for a job, ANY job,  and they answered questions by not even saying anything to do with the original question would you hire them? And she’s going for President, think about that…
So what u have done in the past 3 years?  Let's just talk about the man before me
Where oh where did they find this in competant
QUESTION! What did you not like during Trump 1st presidency. What did you like about the last 3 years?
If according to the current vice president trump has had more control of the government than her then why would we make her president over him? I mean if he can do more as a defendant than she can as vp that's embarrassing for her.
So why not get tuffer at the board Democrats?????
If she can’t answer a simple question? How can she run a country? the answer is no way she is fit to be the president
why did they end the interview so swiftly?
If hes not stable.. what does that make of Joe and Kamala then!!!?
She deflects and doesn't ever answer the question - how the hell is she VP of anything??  Her whole campaign is based on not what she did or is doing, but what trump did... weak and embarrassing  representative of our beautiful country.  👎🏻
How’s she going to pay for $25K for new home buyers?? She’s going to start charging Donald Trump rent for all the space he takes up in her head! 😂
Ten years?   If you win the presidency, will you deport all those millions of illegal immigrants?
How does she know how much was spent on that ad, but has no understanding of white house affairs?
Is she wearing the same earrings she wore in her debate with President Trump?  It look like the same ones but idk.
honest? she never is. just lies. blame always goes to Trump. all his fault. She is evil.
How can anyone vote for her? Who are these people?
My god she is mind numbing to listen to! Waste of space just lies and wasted air taking about nothing that has to do with the question others see her the way i do....right!?
Are the last three and a half years excluded from the last decade?
Why did the dems agree to this interview? Makes no sense
How is this election about focusing on the needs of the American people when she's focused on letting immigrants in and paying Ukraine or giving prison inmates transition surgery????
How is this election about focusing on the needs of the American people when she's focused on letting immigrants in and paying Ukraine or giving prison inmates transition surgery????
Can she not do an interview or debate without the earpiece???
If she gets the presidency is she still going to blame trump for everything???? 😂😂😂😂
can anyone just point me to a question that she actually answers?
Dose she ever answer any questions with real answers?
why does she always wear the same earrings for interviews and debates but never seen in pubic? oh yeah those same earrings are sold on amazon as a ear piece to hear info.
Have you ever heard Donald Trump support tax funded transgender operations???  I have NOT.  But Kamala thinks Trump supports tax payer funded Transgender operations.  What a total qwak.  Vote Trump.
How in the world did he get her to do this interview?
If her word salads end up failing her, you think she'll go back to mouth hugging?
So if the problem was that a bill wasn't passed during your admin, how will your admin continuing magically fix the problem?
Where did her accent go 😂
Israel has been safe and secure for decades so why are we still pretending america has any influence on what Israel does?
Prison inmates get free transitioning surgery? 😂
Hey, Kamala, do you own any other earrings?🤔
21:25 and the experiment?
WHY must America ALWAYS support Israel?  Why must America not ALWAYS support Turkey or Egypt or Botswana?  What's so special about Israel that American senators must blindly swear undying allegiance to a foreign nation?
[Uh, is this a presidential candidate or a middle school student council candidate?]
B:  Do you still support transgender operations for illegal immigrant prison inmates?
Why is he asking a question and not allowing a answer to be complete
18:24 is that the ceiling bird?!
Why did my father pay thousands for his wife to come to this country if it’s always been broken before Biden/Harris got in office
Jesus… political games? You can’t answer an easy yes or no question! You, Mrs. Harris are absolutely pathetic! (And NOT because you’re a female) because you’re a pathetic human being.
Is she wearing the same earrings from the debate ?
Do you like pickles??? Donald trump hates pickles
Why hasn’t anyone spoken on the Biden/harris jab mandate?? 🤔 odd
Why does she always dodge the questions
Didn't Trump have to answer in court for January 6th an insurrection. She should have to answer in a criminal court of law about the coup that her and her party orchestrated against Joe Biden.
Peaceful protests?  Like the takeover in Washington state?  Was that peaceful?
Why does she keep bringing up the last decade when Trump only served 4 years?
Why is she always going back to lies about what Trump said and not what she will do?
so.. are you going to let her talk or are you going to keep forcing your garbage takes onto her rife with desperate attempts at clawing a reaction out of her?  Fox really has gone downhill, jesus..
Harris has went after human traffickers but won’t release the Epstein list?
Wasn't he big on building a wall and he was being ridiculed for not letting immigrants in?
Is it just me or is he holding his laughter?
What a loser. Typical Republican they ask a question and won’t let you answer.
Is he going to let her talk? Sounds like he wants her to Interview him.
Can someone please give me a count of how many of the questions she actually answered instead of changing the subject and going on and on?
Is that a man or a woman
Same earrings as the debate.  Who is telling her what to say?
Why would this guy ask a question and then proceed to not shut the f*ck up?
If trump wins, then the election integrity is sound. If trump loses, then it is corrupt? Win or lose, a true American accepts the people's choice.
Sooo how many people did they bring in ? 🤦‍♀️
Is it just me or does she seem to be “projecting” (unconsciously taking unwanted emotions or traits you don't like about yourself and attributing them to someone else)?
Donald this Donald that, was Donald running the show for the past 4 years or am I missing something?????
Maddam Vice President,  what is your favorite drink?  DONALD TRUMP DOESN'T HAVE A FAVORITE DRINK.
Why didn't he shut up and let her finish her sentences????!!!!!!!!
What a professional Dodger! She cannot answer a question without talking about Trump!
Why is he giving them tax cuts? To keep manufacturing in the USA, I’m tired of people calling me and I can’t understand them cause they hiring others across seas ughh I dislike her she lies and cheats and is dishonest and talks to us as if we slow when she is the one slow
If the President should be able to handle criticizm without threatening to lock people up, why has she threatened and called for people to be locked up that make memes of her?
How many time did she mentioned Trump name??! Can someone tell me?!😂😂
Why did Bret Baier not debunk Kamala when she said trump had broken borders also?
What do you eat for breakfast?   Well Trump hates breakfast
Can she answer one question?
Anyone notice how her eyes are "dead" ?
why in the world does this man continuously interrupt her while she's speaking? you can't...ask a question and refuse to allow her to answer?
A lot of bots here that have 10-12 years since they started account, is the deep state manipulating data to fit their narrative?
If Trump isn’t for the American people, why is it that he actually did something about the Hurricane in NC? He raised money and donated to the people who have lost their homes
Bret: “Let me ask you a question, what is your favourite flavour?” Kamala: “Well I wo-“ Bret: “Ok but are you a vegetarian or not” Kamala: “can I answer your fir-“ Bret: “what’s your favourite type of sauce”
What t he reporter should do is ask her a question, respond with “shut the faq up” as soon as she starts speaking and move onto the next question.
What can be what has been unburdened by what has been?
Why did she just look left off camera like she was taking cues?
Imagine her at a table with Kim Jung Il, Bashir Al Assad, Putin?
I'm sorry but Bret if you're going to ask a question can you at least give a chance to answer? I actually want to hear these answers
Why are politicians the worst kind of people
why is she yelling? why didn't bret no hold her feet to the fire? he was way too easy on her.......loser
Is it me or does this interviewer look like he could be in the muppet show?
This woman is not even prepared to be a building manager, imagine a nation with global power?😂 She couldn't answer a question.
The interviewer is weak: why was he chosen to conduct this interview?
Why didn’t Bret ask her about their rhetoric toward him and if they took any responsibility for the two attempted assassination attempts?
Doesn't she come from a middle class family? I can't remember
Why would dems push her for president????
Why is Joe Biden on trial?
Why would you invite a guest on & then not allow them to speak?
Stop blaming Trump for your mistakes! Can she answer 1 Question without mentioning President Trump?🙄
Why did I need to manually find this on the fox page and it didn't shown up when I searched "fox kamala harris interview"?????
From New Zealand. Who is this dude? Do American blokes get Botox or something like that.
How can she talk so much but say so little, and not ever actually answer the question being asked 🤦🏼‍♂️
Was she at the DNC???
8:45 is she about to cry?
She thinks that discrediting trump will make her look better!😂how stupid can she be?🤪 No matter what she looks bad because everyone can hear she never answer questions !  The question which really knock her down is : » when did you notice first time the decline of president Joe Biden ? » to which she did not answer !
Does she ever answer a question without lying?
How's the wall that Trump promised us through Mexican payments?  Shouldn't the wall have sealed off illegal entrance?
Why does she keep bringing up Donald Trump?

What number "word salad" was that on the menu?
Im confused....wasn't the border handled and closed when she took over????? Didn't she open it????
She cannot even answer a question what kind of Fruitloop is she?
Kamala has no plan! Keep running from her questions, what kind of leader is this?
When did you notice a change in Bidens capabilities? Well, I would say that he's always been capable because I saw him brush his teeth once.
Is she wearing those pearl earrings again?  I can't listen to her.  She makes me sick to my stomach.  It's been all a plan.
Why  she can  not answer a question!
We have a broken system....lady you do know you are the VP during this broken system right? So who is at fault for such broken system!!?? HMMMMM......🤔  🤣😂🤣😂
1. Why is she ridiculed for being middle class and an experienced prosecutor? Those are good things last time I checked. How is it bad/funny?
Does nobody have an issue with her constantly being cut off? This clearly had an agenda and all I see are comments making jokes. She is handling this with class and you people don’t have an issue with her dealing with a hostile interview?
Isn’t she the one who wanted the rhetoric to stop?  Hypocrite!
what about the middle class who have been working their asses off
So we just going to ignore FOX News used the wrong clip and Bret just ignores her? Hmmmmmmm
So what would you do differently again? 😂
Why is the obsession that she has with DT? I mean I get is her opponent, but she is in current Administration and she is part of the past too, all this years as VP... DT can't run the office if she is in it so why is he to blame that's just childish... very disappointed.
Would you say that fox supports Trump ? Honestly asking.
Why are people still supporting him?  Because they have been lied to and they believe him. They have fallen into his grip of cultism. Those people are delusional.
Where’s her accent?
What kind of interviewer doesn't let the person being interviewed to speak and to answer the question he asked?
You and I know what I am talking about?? I actually don't, what are you talking about? Hahaha  That is what happens when you talk to yourself!!! Hahaha
Is this the best of what Americans must choose from? I feel sorry for them.
Why does she keep talking about Trump! Focus on talking about you and your policies! TDS big time!!
Seriously, is there any one who still supports Kamal?
She loves to drown out the clock ⏰  doesnt she ?
Is she still going to go on Joe Rogan after this?  That is going to be hilarious!
Why does Comrade "Stepford" Kommula and her commie controllers hate all the other commies in the world??? I.E.-Russia, North Korea, Venezula, etc....?????
Why is it a topic of discussion? It's a topic for Taking ACTION. There's nothing to talk about - there is a problem that can only be solved by taking action. Words can't solve issues.  TALK IS CHEAP.
Is Trump also at fault for your lack of answers and having no plan?
PRIORITY???? THEN WHY HASN'T JOE CLOSED THE BORDER? HE OPENED IT, HE CAN CLOSE IT! Then congress etc.  can figure out the details. Though I'll be surprised if they do.
Why is Trump still refusing interviews?
How’s its voice so annoying?
Since when is a psychopath an authority on psychopathology?
This is such unprofessional interviewing. How are you going to ask a question and the interrupt every time she tries to answer?
Is she saying that dems have not used rhetoric that is divisive? That is gaslighting
What exactly is the supposed MEDICAL NECESSITY for anyone to go through gender reassignment?  I'm serious.  What possibly could necessitate from a valid medical point for anyone to switch gender?
Why does a supposed billionaire keep asking us for money? And hawking trash made in China?
Q: Do you support more or less benefits for illegal immigrants?
Q: How would you prioritze spending of tax revenue?
Q: Shall I get you coffee or tea?
Is she trying to read a teleprompter?
How is she supposed to answer a question without getting interrupted 🙄
When I get interviewed I answer questions directly.  Why doesn’t this woman do this?
She didn’t answer the Biden Question. Is he The real Biden or a fake? 🫢
How does it feel having your a×× handed to you by a girl 😂😂😂 @Brett
BLM a peaceful protest??  40 people died from the riots. Millions and millions of property damage?  We have suffered so much by the current administration.
Why did her management allow for this interview? 😂😂😂😂
So you are going to ignore them showing her edited clip to trick her up?
She only has one set of earrings?
How, just how? We are living in a simulation.
We need to shut to border down,not hire mire judges and more agents,and spend how much more money,unnecessarily??!
How can anyone speak with that much botox? 😂
why is imagrations so important to these left wing.
I’ve never seen more migrants in line to get a CDL.  Lets face it, is the DMV really doing their due diligence in verifying those documents?  If your answer is no, you think those “frustrated” BP folks are doing their of job also?
Would we really like this woman with her hand on the nuclear codes?
Is this video isnt the full length one i suppose
How can anyone vote for this crackpot? 19 days till Election Day and she’s still deflecting questions.
Why is she still using language that almost had Trump taking out
What’s the point of an interview if you don’t let her talk?
why does she use the hand signal that is basically her making a wall with her hand blocking her from everyone and we see her fakeness and inability to do the job!
Why does she keep promising change on Day 1 when she's been in office for 1,367 days?
Ooey its getting hot. Is she sweating I don't know if she gonna be able to handle the heat. Just wondering, is somebody gonna save her? Those democratic Puppet masters probably going to pull her out. I wouldn't be surprised
Are you sorry for letting those illegal immigrants go that killed someone’s daughter? I have experience in transnational criminal organizations👍
Why is he talking over Her?
Why the avoidance yoh, every answer was a non answer
Is it just me or are you able to skip Trump Ads on YouTube but are forced to watch Kamala ones?  For some reason I can’t skip the Kamala ones and I want to lol.
I don’t understand she had over 3 years to fix things and all she does is blame trump?
Is it just me or did she not answer a single question??
KAMALA - answer the question….when did you notice Biden’s mental state had changed?!? She continually lies to the American people
Really? How you do when you in White House or you only puppy for democrats party tell you what to do 😀😃😄
is it just me or was this full interview challenging to find?  Either the SEO keywords were bad, or they're intentionally trying to hide it.
Oh my God can I keep jabbering away and deflecting from the question without being interrupted buy me re-ask the question that I'm avoiding?
What if brett could SHUT THE F@&# UP and let the woman speak!?! He spent the entire time talking over or putting words in her mouth.  Really demonstrated confidence like an alpha schmuck.
She’s a ghetto mess ask her about Willie brown?
Do you know who spilled the milk on floor? Trump four years ago😅
Why is the top of her head cgi'd?
Baier:  Why'd you remove the remain in Mexico policy for illegal migrants?
Why does she start talking with a southern drawl?? It’s fuckn’ embarrassing to watch!
How is answering a question about americas biggest adversary, saying trump called someone a "loser", grounded in fact? She answered absolutely nothing.
Oh the same staff Trump fired for various reasons?  It was a legit termination. They’re mad because they were fired so yes unfortunately they will get even.
Do you regret the decision? 🎉 Who made that decision, really?
WHAT IS A ‘SCORGE’?
Does he really think he's a journalist?
Kamala 😂 cannot answer a question…not one.  How can she be President?  She only comes back with how awful she thinks Trump is.  The word salad tactic is just to waste time and get through the interview without answering any questions.  How dishonest and deceitful!  😅😅😂😂
Is he going to let her speak?
Has she ever actually answered a question?
Am I the only one who finds her voice incredibly annoying? with all the whining ugh
Kamala, what are the policies you keep bringing up but haven’t shown on your venn diagram?
Why “interview” her if you don’t let her answer the question?
Guy just won’t shut up would he? He just keeps wanting to talk over someone. He asked a question and then won’t let her answer. Give her a minute to say something if you’re going to ask your questions.
What about the black mother with a daughter with sickle cell.
Why do they keep avoiding the Ukraine part of this border bill.  That was the main reason they turned it down.  They had to agree to support Ukraine if they wanted the border bill to pass.
Can he put his eyebrows down 🤣🤣
How many times did she say Donald Trump?
What a horrible unprofessional interview. Fox is entertainment that isn’t entertaining.  Ask the question, let the person respond. It’s just that simple. Let the viewer decide if they like or dislike the response.
Who went after peaceful protesrs in the last year Mme vice president?
10:31 does she want to be trumps Veep? Cause I don't think the job has an openings
*actually, what are you taking about?* lol
How could anyone vote for her after watching one of her interviews
How does Fox News take itself seriously?  More importantly, how do Fox News viewers take it seriously?  The same people who rightfully point out than CNN and MSNBC are trash watch a network that is even more dishonest and biased.
13:42 what the actual? She can never answer a question. It's her good Trump bad. God please don't let me listen to her for four years.
How come there's no tax plan for a single or married people with no kids?
Why when she shakes her head her hair moves on her left but is still on her right 🤔
did she respond to anything?  I missed that, must have been in the br 🤮  i guess I'll go look up those policies of hers
When you ask a politician be it Trump or Harris, they all dance around the actual question.
Why did Brett edit and adulterate and change Trump's answer from Trump's  own interview? This is frightening. This is why Fox got sued for almost 1 billion dollars. They will lie, cheat and steal from the truth. That video of the REAL words of Trump  is widely available. Trump has said that he intends to use the United States Military to find "the enemy within". Brett chose to edit, chop up that clip and not include Trump's statement. Why would Brett do that? Because Brett does not want Fox viewers to see the truth. BRETT is a liar. This is why Fox was sued in court. They do not want people to know what is really going on and they have bought up all of the markets in small towns and rural America because they know people are afraid and they have a captive audience. Fox, Brett, stop lying. America, wake up. We are not a Hollywood movie. We are a democracy.
Donald Trump has been divisive?  What about Joe Biden's State Of The Union speech?  Why does she refuse to answer the question "What, SPECIFICALLY are you going to do?  And more importantly, why haven't you already done it?"
How can anybody be so full of crap??
Is she confused, or does she like blaming Trump for all her wrong decisions???
Did they fact-check her
Can she tell the truth about her and Joe has done to this country? Just wondering
The earrings again??? Every interview, same earrings...
Did the last 3 1/2 years happen???? Am I crazy that it seems like "the powers that be" are trying to focus on things that occurred 4 yrs ago
Well did anyone learn anything new about Kama-lier? I learned she eats sleeps and breathes Trump❤ Just like the American people. ❤️Trump 2024❤️
What’s the point of asking her questions that you won’t even allow her to answer?
What is she talking about???
6 democrats? just 6 dude.... really? what's the point there -_-
What is the name of the interviewer? He is great
As a neutral party here, why are you all proud of him cutting g her off? We need to HEAR the answers.
You guys do realize she’s not the current president, right?
She can't answer a question with a direct answer She has to dance around it and provide the word salad... Can you smell liar?
every interview with same earings ? are they headset?
Had she not been 20 minutes late for the interview Brett wouldn’t have had to rush it and cut her off so much to redirect her to the actual question
How is this real
Is Kamala Harris's IQ less than 50. I think I got dumber listening to her speak.
Why get rid of something b4 you have a good replacement?
Who are the Republicans that were on the stage with her? She's mentioned it a few times....so who are they?
Did she forget we have been through a Trump administration and the economy was freakin great back then??!
Is she going to the shawn Ryan show ?
Can she please answer the question without him interrupting her
The way she evade accountability how could anyone in their right mind marry and take her serious???
WHO LET HER COOK???
those estimates in "billions" for iran: are they lined to the inflation rate?
Did she answer any of questions? I didn’t get her any answers, I was lost.
6:01 people are funny…everyone is trying to make it seem like she’s dancing around the answer…when the reality is that the question is being asked in a demeaning way.  “Do you regret lifting the policies?”  For starters…she’s not the one that lifted anything…so how can she regret it being lifted…secondly…there was an attempt to put a different plan in effect that may have had some favor towards immigrants…but we are an immigrant friendly country…and that plan was sideswiped…so there’s literally no reason for her to regret anything or owe any apologies…but she can’t just say that…because it then destroys the image of her campaign…so instead she is forced to attempt to  explain that the issue was in fact imperative and was addressed but it was fought and there were a lot of issues to get to so it’s not like they could harp on an issue they’re being fought on…  Biden received a country that was heavily divided and in financial ruin while also navigating a pandemic that should’ve never made it past an epidemic…everything had to be addressed…and immigrants are still people that have complex situations…they deserve to be treated as such…lifting the policies was supposed to go hand in hand with the new policy…they got one and not the other and it turned disastrous…if they spent the entire term fighting over the border then absolutely nothing else would’ve gotten done and the things that ppl are trying to say took place actually would’ve…  It’s not evading a question if the question is designed to incriminate you…she’s a lawyer…she saw the setup coming a mile away…y’all gotta be smarter than that.
I get it, migrants and inflation are important issues which need to get fixed, but is worth loosing democracy in the US by voting for Trump?
What “solutions” did her and Joe create while in office?  Practically nothing got done

the questioned he should have asked is: "If Trump was so bad... what did she did to fix it?!"
What a joke. Answer a question
Trump was in office 4 years, if he did such a good job why did he lose the last election?
Why is she sooo nasal all the time!!!!????? Her voice kills me
How can anyone vote for harris, you can choose not to vote for anyone.
only one pair of ear rings ?
Joe has the experiment? Hmm. 21:22
She’s a disaster and Trump is past it, dear God but is this what America is reduced to?
Is she his Baby Mama??? I swear to god she sounds like a bitter entitled babymama!!!
Where did her southren accent go to?
Why wasn’t Palestine and Israel genocide questions asked? Why are we supporting Israel and Ukraine?
This woman dances around every hard question. I'm glad you asked that question, that is a good question,let me answer that question, wait, what was the question? Never a straight answer. I'd like to finish, yes please finish. For Pete's sake
Why cant she answer just ONE question without blaming all her problems on Trump?  She's such a twat!
Why ain't you doing this now?
17:34 what are you talking about?
Is she really this stupid? 😢😢
12:01  would you advocate? No answer. Redirect to Trump and his policies.
9:18  do you still support that?
Is this interview? Jesus!!  Is this man Republican?  As an interviewer you have to  stay neutral.
“Why do ppl trust Trump when it comes to economics?” Good question. Why do those people choose to believe a narcissist who bankrupted a casino and doesn’t know how tariffs work over economic scholars?
Why is Kalama wearing the same earrings in every interview? Clearly someone is telling her what to say!
Is this an interview or an interrogation?
What is she going to do to stop the illegal immigration and get them out?
Why didn’t he shut her down
Where is her responsibility for her administration? 😤
How can people listen to her talk and think she's making any sense at all?
Does she have any friends?
Does she not understand that the Republicans supporting her are considered horrible and evil by conservatives and independents?
This is an interview of Trudeau in his favorite dressup, isn't it?   Answers questions exactly the same.  They are both globalist puppets.
Locking ppl up they dont agree with is exactly what Democrats tried to do? All the lawfare against Trump?
Was this a debate or an interview?
Why not let the woman speak?
Indian twist on chickin neckin. Is she new?
Why doesn't she ever answer the question? She avoids the answer everytime
Do men experience actual pain when women speak, making them constantly interrupt, talk over & man-splain? Did that watermelon-head almost explode off his shoulders every time she spoke?
What are your policies?????????
Wasn't this supposed to be an hour long interview?
She was the vice president doing delegation tasks from Biden, what do you think she should have done differently??? She was not a free agent, she had a boss, why would you think she would have done anything differently
Scary, did the headset die?
Is she capable of answering questions at all??
That is AWESOME. It's like a psychotic break in real-time!! She can't answer a single question with anything but deflection or she knows she's finished!! Ask about her policy, hear about Trump. Can she actually hear Bret's questions because she seems to be having a conversation with someone else? This has got to be parody, right? Is this a Trump AD?? It should be. Bret may have finally exposed her and changed the world.
Are you serious @b4ltm0re_jay, did you even watch the whole video? And if you DID, that would be the question WERE YOU EVEN PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT SHE WAS SAYING
Does she realize Donald Trump has not spent his majority in government
Why is she gaslighting him?
If the border mattered why did you give up on it after day 1?
What if I don’t want either candidate?
What a liar you someone’s lying when they never answer the question
Question is does she hear herself?  And how does she keep a straight face??? Amazing
Does she have another pair of earrings?
Why was our country safer and prospering when President Trump was in office.
And what the hell are you doing?! Sitting here belittling Trump the whole time! Tell us what YOU are going to do to make a difference! 😡
Kamala if you're turning the page on rhetoric then why are you talking rhetoric b.s. about the past blaming others instead of taking responsibility for the last 4 years of massive price increases inflation, the wars and hostilities internationally between the USA and other nations while you go running off to sorority parties instead of meeting with world leaders who come to the USA to discuss potential World War 3 issues?
Wasn't this supposed to be a debate?
What, no live fact checking?
Fox you SUCK!!  This is a completely biased interrogation, not an interview?  Who the F keeps interviewing the interviewee?  This is the most unprofessional interview the world has EVER seen!
I still want to know why she never chose to go to the border. She could’ve even tagged along with a one or two times Biden went?
Why not ask if she blew her way up the career ladder?
Can she hear  you with  them earrings.
Why can't we "skip" the Harris ad?
Can I at least get some dressing for this salad 🥗
LOL! "What are you talking about?"
How much botox is too much botox?  Brett doesn't know.
How many Homes did BLackrock buy and now rent out, 200,000? People could buy them?
Who’s read both, Trump’s 16 page plan and Harris’s 82 page plan?
Now when is Trump going on MSNBC?
"What would you like for dinner?"  "I will follow the law!"  "Would you like Italian, ranch, Blue Cheese or Thousand Island with your word salad?"
15:32 does Kamala realize that a wide swath of Democrats ranging from RFK Jr. to Tulsi Gabbard have been welcomed by Trump into his camp?
DO YOU NOTICE THE EARRINGS? SHE WEARS THOSE SAME EARRINGS WHEN EVER SHE'S INTERVIEWED. SAME FROM THE DEBATE. Everyone knows she doesn't make sense when she talks, I bet those are mic'd up🤨
Is there any question she can answer without going back to the barrel of curated answers from the greeting cards in her head?
Does she have any opinions besides Trump's fault??
YouTube’s keeping the comments on?
Why hasn’t she done anything for the American ppl in almost four years?
If you wanted to fix the problem, why would you repel the measures holding the wave BEFORE your "border bill" was approved?
What im having a hard time understanding is how she went from 4%  approval  in her 2020 run..to  suddenly a VP ??? To NOW a presidential candidate..what did she do in 3 years to garner so much support Now.. can anyone note a  notable public appearance ishes made in last 3 years?  And why she spent 10 months of her first 2 years as VP in her Brentwood mansion instead of Washington?  Vote wisely
Is this the whole interview  or is it there more ?
When people ask about illegal immigration the question should be how many refugees did the United States create through destroying their country either through proxy wars or overthrowing their democratically elected Leaders with a military coup.
She sounds like socialist plus communist?
Why was this video not showing up in my suggestion videos? Hmmm YouTube censorship?
George Clooney is your source though? 😅 both sides are hilarious
Is she campaigning for Donald Trump?😂
Did anyone ask trump if he felt bad a black woman died in a parking lot giving birth to a dead baby.?
I wonder how Trump's supporters will cope after November 5. They'll need some copium 😅😅
April or October??? Holy Crapazoid. That's a hell of a lot of difference
When you ask a question if you want to hear the answer you stay quiet, otherwise you're just asking the question to highlight the question not to hear an answer. Kudos to Kamala for not backing down
Why wasn't any of it done? During their term.
Didnt her and Joe sell off the steel from the border Wall ?
People are going to drive to work or whatever. Wouldn’t you rather them know the laws and learn to drive than to get behind the wheel blindly?
Why did it take until a few weeks ago for her policy to hit her website trumps has been up since the start smh she's should be charged with treason knowing bidens condition for 4 years and letting him run the country into the ground
Why didn’t she answer the questions here instead of directing everyone to her website?
3:44 why does she wear those ear buds/earrings all the time??
Every time she was onto an answer Brett couldn’t pummel her for he just talked over her with another pointed question. What does interviewing like that do for your viewers?
Are there any of the 115k comments that show support for her?!😂
Can we find these cases she keeps talking about?
The blame game!!! Why isn’t Harris not owning up to her time as VP??
Who is this random woman and why is she even talking?
What type of Caucasian is she?
What in the actual fuk
Did she answer any question???
She got pissed to the point of losing her composure this much in 20 minutes? Yikers
When is Trump going on MSNBC?...
Wait, you never demean “MAGA?” Call them a threat to democracy? Minions following Trump? I have heard all those messages in democratic rallies
Has anyone noticed that Kamala Harris wears the same earrings to every news interview.  The same ones she wore at the debate.
Are Americans that dumb to vote for Kamala to be the President of USA? She does not even know what she's talking about, she can't even take accountability on her failures as a VP! Such a disgrace.
Did you say that?? Well trump didn’t say that
I’m gonna keep watching by I’m less than a minute in and he already asked a question and didn’t let her answer. Was she avoiding it? Of course, she’s a politician. But are you here to interview her or yourself?   Bad start. Hope it gets better
What a farce!  She cannot answer a simple question!!
Did anyone else notice her chair is a few inches taller?
Why doesn't she get it that she created the problem in the first place... Oh Denial and Deception...
Wow, this lady makes my ears bleed.. Can she not answer a question with a direct answer? Everything she says comes off as dishonest.
Why cant she answer a simple direct question
why does she talk like a narcissistic caretaker? oh wait, joe Biden.
We have a like and dislike button, where's the lmao button?
Did she ever answer a question?  WHAT A JOKE!!!!
So many stupid questions from Baier. "Do you want to apologize?" "What are you turning the page on?" He's trying so hard to keep everything about vibes and soundbites.  "Why do people support trump if he's bad?" This is anti-journalism.
genuinely how is mr brett doing a good job if all he did was talk over the person he's supposed to be interviewing...?
Why is there a housing shortage in the U.S.?
Where be her accent Rasta  Oye Chico where is her accent  Ya betta thanka her accents missin
Why did Fox go so easy on her?
Where is the whole interview??
Why does this guy keep interpreting
Is this the person that wants to go to Joe Rogan Podcast? She will be skinned alive over there lol
"What are you turning the page from?"  My man here asking the most important questions :D
Why do politicians have everyone fooled? They come up with bill after bill and tell us how hard they work at every chance when really all that is needed is a cup full of common sense with a sprinkle of reason and compassion. Farmers and steel workers work hard.
Anyone else ready to be unburdened by what has been?
Kamala accuses Trump of threatening to use military force against civilians? One month ago the DoD re-released directive 5240.01. Now it allows military to use lethal force against civilians and it is publicly released.
which 79%? its like going to different Universe when you talk to faux and chump zombies my GOD!
Did you need border agents when you flew the Haitians to Springfield,Ohio ?
Question was Biden when did you notice he was going downhill?  Answer Donald Trump is definitely unstable
Why does everyone still call it a "border security" bill? It was a foreign war bill! Only $20B of $118B would have gone to the border.  That's like telling someone you're working late, working for a few minutes, and spending the night at the bar.
Will she ever answer any questions
Why didn't she go to the border before now? And her policies will help the economy? Yea right.  Lining thier pockets and hurting Americans making them rely on the government
Why isn’t Biden on the ballot?  She can’t answer the dang question.
How long are we going to tolerate this crap?
Would this interview really make a difference since they can still be able to rig the election for their advantage?
why does he keep interrupting her...  she really cant maintain composure or articulate ideas well under pressure tho... wasnt she a lawyer?
Country continues to be dumbed down ; how can immigrants be “illegal” if admitted legally?  Average US citizen is unable to process this reasoning…sadly!
If we know what we need, why isn’t it happening? We ALWAYS KNOW what we need, but for some reason.. IT NEVER HAPPENS.
Didn't answer the question
What is she talking about? I have never heard those things? I have heard her say similar.
She hasn’t increased punishments for illegal crossings at all?! Who is getting these punishments?
Does she own another pair of earrings? She is always wearing the pearl earbuds.
Just one question is all should take to conclude everything  When asked about President Biden’s mental ability and if that answer is an absolute hoax answer, what right do you have to assess President Trump.? Simple as that….
How is the $25k tax credit for first time home buyers going to be funded? Oh right, more taxes.
Question the people wanna know why are you sending all that money over there?: answer: Donald Trump.
My question is. Do they only vote on a border security bill every four years ? 😂
Question the people wanna know why are you sending all that money over there?: answer: Donald Trump.
I just wonder when god will strike her down when every word out of her mouth is a lie?  My god she is disgusting.
When is somebody going to laugh in her face? I’m serious, like she is no better than any other person, and if any other person gave me the answers she gave, I would LAUGH OUT LOUD in their face. Doo better FOX
VP DOES NOT have lots of authorities. question to you all, do you say NO to your boss? If you do then you get fired. She just a VP.
I have a question: When did the Vice President stop having responsibility for the government administration she represents? I ask, because I don't understand why Mrs. Kamala says "I'm not Biden" but she is the Vice President of the Biden administration, she is also responsible for everything from this administration.
So like, isn't the point of an interview to ask questions and then listen to the answers? No wonder no one watches Fox News any more...
"If trump is as bad as you say, why is half of America still voting for him?"  Unfortunately the answer to this question that there is a significant amount of voting power in his favor who are relatively uneducated. He's previously said a few things that really resonated with these voters and come fact or fiction to these statements, they're going to die on this hill.
Is Kamala on drugs…seriously..? And alcohol.  She’s using something.!
New generation of politics? She turns 60 in just a few days.
Question: do you regret releasing them, murderers? Answer.: rambling word salad.😂
11:28 serious question here. What is a medical necessity that justifies the need to change someones gender?
where is the salad dressing
Really? Why  the "politician speak" speak like a person! and II'm trump hater
How do you spell America Madame Vice President.. C...A...N...A...D...A.. America..See my mother's friend, who was a small business owner,thought me to spell..
How does she sleep at night?
How many times did Donald Trump's name come out of her mouth in this interview??
Anybody ever heard of an 80 page resume? Anything over 2 and I don't even read them. How do you go from no policies listed or even talked about for the most part to having 80 pages of policies on your website.  Someone should do a search to see how much is just copy-paste. My guess is all of it besides a few lines from a writer and editor.
Why is it that attacking Israel means that has American blood on its hands? When did Israel become America? Why is the defense of another country the highest priority of our government?
Does this woman ever STOP blaming Trump?
How many illegal immigrants  that have been let into the country over the passed 3 years will be voting in the upcoming election?
What are these plans she keeps talking about?
Serious question though, does border patrol support Harris?
Let’s talk about what does she know this is awlful ugh and she is going to fix what? lol judges at the wall???
If Joe Biden’s presidency was so great why change it?
Was this an interview or debate? This guy has a weird face lift.
Then why wasn't this her top priority?!!!! She was IN CHARGE OF OUR BORDER!!!!! She needs to go back to work at Mcdonalds!
why is the US financing a genocide?
Is he going to let her talk? Or he know that her answer are going to make logical sense and he can’t have that on fox? So he has to cut her off constantly?
Is this woman an adult ?
What kind of interviewer ask a question and then doesn't give the person time to answer. He is so rude, talking over her and trying not to let her answer. This is some FOX NEWS MESS, just like Fox News. A Hot Mess, glad she held her own.
Like c'mon is she going to answer questions or attempt a campaign speech? Gj Brett
What was the question?
Does this moron EVER answer a question?
oh my goodness what happened?She didn't know what to say what country she say
is she indian or black \? WHO TO BLAME? LOL
Does she know ANY of her policies? They've been told what to do so long she doesn't even know what her job is.
If it needs to be fixed, why let anyone in until it is?
i'm from Europe. is this person for real?😮
Why is she wearing those ear bud earrings again?
Why doesn't  she answear the question,  he will be president  again
How is this person going to deal with China & Russia ?
Bret roasted her why did she even do this interview ?
Joe Biden is still sharp ?  Sharp as an Apple.
How does someone talk so much yet says NOTHING
What a LOADED question in the first 90 seconds. "Some of those people were men who did crimes. Explain that!" I don't know, are some of your neighbors serial killers? Would you have any clue? Do we kick them out just to be safe?
Does dude have enough plastic surgery?
Why will she not answer any of the questions
Is she for real ?
When are we going to wake up and realize that politics is horse shi?
Why yall focused on immigration instead of housing? Companies buy houses and turn them into airbnbs, just stop them from buying or at least increase taxes for them and let them leave the houses alone for the single family people…
13:19 - Slip that she’s just the face of the machine?
So who is dumber? Her or all the people who support her?
Wait, didn't she recently say something about being unburdened by what has been? But she keeps blaming everything on Trump.
.....yes or no? why the rambles....
He asks one loaded question, she starts to answer, then he immediately interrupts her, then slightly changes the question and attacks her for not answering. I know Fox Brain Rot goes deep, but it's impossible for any of you to think this is what an interview looks like, right?
If the question was... Given that any number between 5 and 7 will suffice, what is 3 + 3?... You still wouldn't get an answer of ANY number by this waffling wannabe...
Australian here! Is it just me or are there other people wondering about the earrings? 😊
first question. how many illegal aliens came into the US since trump left Office.  no answer - or unable to answer.  you would think a lawyer that handled around 10 cases in her career would be able to talk better. another example:  WHEN did you notice Byden couldn't do the job anymore?   no answer.  follow up question, no answer.
Sooooo why hasn't she done anything to help people while in office??
Wth is she talking about?
Why is she always wearing those same earrings during every interview
Was this an interview or a debate??
If she knew the dangers of open borders then how does one reason why she'd support opening the borders for all without vetting?
Does this person think the United States is a democracy?
How is she not going to continue Joe Biden's  Policies? Joe said himself she had a say in everything he did! She is the Biden administration! Exactly what is the new path???
Did she even answer 1 question?
Why didn't Fox let the interview go on longer?  Lol
I don’t understand if Biden hasn’t declined how come he’s not on the ballot?
If she didn’t do anything because of Trump then what gives? He is still alive! And she will always blame someone.
Where in the constitution does it say this is a democracy? I’ll wait
Can we get a third candidate please? Oh wait...
So why is this one border bill the hill to die on? So it didn’t go through and you quit and give up for 3.5 years??
Is this the kamala with hidden microphone or the kamala who do a cant do a interview ?
How anyone can vote for this lady is beyond me.
Does she ever actually answer a question?
An interview where questions can't get answered because Kamala gets interrupted all the time. You want to get answers or just ask questions? Then let her speak!
If Joe Biden died, she would have to step up as President of the United States?
Is it only 26 min? I'm just checking this is the full interview. Gonna watch later.
Libs / Dems have been more divisive over the past 4 years than anyone. Also, does she have an identity outside of Donald Trump?
Why does Bret baier allow her to sit there and make up stuff that was never said by him or any of his people
Freaking POLLS are a farce. They make up the nbrs. NOTHING from MSM is legit. Have you woken up yet? This is a teaching video on HOW to NOT answer a question and to refocus the subject matter to something else.
Why didn't he let her talk. And when did those men come into the country that came into the USA? And why is he supporting Trump who did not adhere to the laws. Broke families up and allowed children to be molested by older children, allowed children to get sick and die while being in cages sleeping on concrete floors.
When did you noticed Bidens mentally unstable ?
does anyone notice at around 24:10 she’s talking extremely slow and taking awkward pauses? and then a couple seconds later, bret acknowledges someone behind the camera despite their still being plenty of time? and then it almost seems as she’s chewing the clock out at the end with the rambling, very strange im surprised no one is talking about this…
Enemy within? Look in the mirror Kamel.
Why havent you given Americans support when natural disasters have happened? You instead gave BILLIONS OF TAX PAYERS MONEY TO Ukraine! What is going on here? FEMA said our country doesn't have enough money to help our OWN COUNTRY! WHAT IS GOONG ON??
Girl what u talking about u need ur note cards????
Where are the cackles?
How come when you read comments from liberal media its 100% pro liberal comments, and when you read comments from conservative media posts its 100% pro conservative comments?
What a fuckn liar, still can't answer a question.
How on Earth anyone will vote for her is beyond understanding. She's been the Vice President for nearly 4 years, everything that has happened is her fault.
Why does he keep talking over her? He wouldn’t let her answer a single question lol why even ask if your just guna interrupt ?
Kamala how about a plan and answering the question instead of trashing Trump? I want to know what you stand for?
So, is she running for the head of Israel or the United States?
She can’t answer a question, she flip flops on her position, she refuses to take any accountability for her time in office. Why can’t people see this? She is the worst…
Can she answer a single question?
Why she hasn’t done it????🤦‍♀️👎
Who was wrapping him very hard?  Fox?
Donald Trump hasn’t done anything but word salads for years,he never answers questions & usually goes off talking about something totally unrelated but we want to criticize her for not answering questions? She’s trying but he keeps talking over her. Trump would be talking about Hannibal Lector or being friends with Putin.
Does she ever answer a question?
How many times did she say Donald Trump in this interview?
How many times did she say Donald Trump in this interview?
Holy Botox Bret. You ok?
When is she going to uphold the laws? Tomorrow?
Is the plan in the room with us?
HOW is it ever medically necessary to change your gender?
What an unprofessional interviewer. Don't ask someone a question and then refuse to let them speak.
How did she pass grade school
Oh is this what an actual Q&A with a democratic candidate sounds like? I forgot it's been so long.
Why interview someone if you want to own the narrative?
Was she invited up there just to be disrespected? Smh
Why does she keep pausing before answering and looking to her right like she is listening to someone in her ear on how to answer said question!?!?!? Gotta love those blue tooth earrings!!
If not misunderstood, the very first question was how many illegal immigrants, if estimated, were released into the US during the Biden administration…. I didn’t hear any number at all….how can I vote for the person who can’t even answer a question?
If there was a wall, we wouldn’t have to spend so much on more officers why would we risk more border patrols lives by not protecting them with a wall?
how about those non-racist black-only grants and handouts?
Is she wearing those special earrings to help answer the questions?
I made it to 5:21 before needing to shut it off. How far did y’all make it?!
ONLY GOD can get this lady to answer a question?????????
I wonder about the ones that are in front of line for legalization. What country's, family's, and class are getting court dates first.
Does she really think she can win by talking about her opponent instead of herself?
does she have a word count to reach?
18:23 did anyone hear that?
No accountability.  Do we want that?  That’s a hard NO!!
Why do men never let women finish speaking or is it just this idiot
Why did you let her skip your first question which was very important.
When will Trump sit down on MSNBC?
Is this the full interview?
What about the local section 8 offices that have no funding but have funding to put immigrants in. The offices that have been closed over two years!
Has she ever given any good answers? I agree
Is the witch wearing her mic-ed earrings?  Just curious!
why doesn't she straight forward answer the question. always deflects. this is what we want for another 4
Can somebody give me the information for Kamala’s dance class? I think I could be a champion if I took her course.
I thought laws (like immigration ) were passed in congress...when did it become  the responsibility of the executive branch to "fix immigration"?
So funny is it me or is she wearing those earrings that she had on the debate? The earpiece 😂.
20.13 lock people up who disagree woth him? You mean like you have been doing with all these nonsense indictments? 😂😂😂 clueless
Hmmm I wonder if kamala has a speaker in her ear?
Why is she so agitated in this interview…
17:25  What are we talking about?
What about her staff that quit working under her. 🤫
Another “word salad” bar. Couldn’t answer 1 question directly. Evaded every question. How many times did she allude to “Donald Trump…?” If you’re still voting for her, you’re what’s wrong with this country!
wow what a jerk he is, why interview someone and not let them speak?
Why dont people understand that she is THE VICE PRESIDENT!! It's not her policy, she wasnt making the decisions about the border!! Vice presidents have very little power!! Vice presidents follow the Presidents orders!!
Ask yourself this, would you want this woman to be your supervisor at work?
What are you turning the page from? Best question ever!
Is that a smoke alarm chirp @18:23 ?!😂
what are you doing for working people?
How ridiculous she started most of her answers blaming trump and then just never answered the questions. Lady is the queen of dancing around a question and avoiding the answer
Who cares about iareal?
Btw is Joe Biden still president? Is he doing things, running the country?
What even is this question about surgeries in prison as if that was any of the government‘s business? The government has nothing to do with who gets what surgeries regardless of whether someone is in prison or not? That’s up to their doctors/ insurance provider, the president can’t just go in there and decide that someone they don’t like gets excluded from the normal procedure.
Has yet to answer one question she is standing on diverting hard!!!
Why is a gender reassignment surgery necessary for inmates?
What is your plan
If Trump and republicans thought the first Biden border bill was so bad then why did the Republican majority voted against the latest one that would been the toughest one? Hmm 🤔
Why did she keep bringing up Donald Trump????
Are those the same earrings???
What the actual F*** did I just watch?
Going after ppl who are engaged in peaceful protest? Aren’t you guys the ones who tracked down and locked up the protesters from Jan 6th but didn’t track down or lock anyone up from the BLM riots?
Boy she REALLY like those earings ayy?
Why don't he let The new improve vice President to ask the question.
Why is she acting like its a debate ? Let the guy finish asking the questions so i can hear it.
Why is she doing this
Can you say filibuster
Kamala Harris was asked and not allowed to answer . What does it mean to answer ?  It means that she should have been allowed to talk and explain her point , but the interviewer actually wanted noise because you dont want answers when you dont allow the other to talk . So when you ask a question and you dont allow the other to talk , then there are two possibilities :   1 Either you are not able to understand  or you want to lead the conversation elswhere and not let the other make her point . Such weak questions .
Was she using her real accent in this Interview????
Kamala kept her legs and arms crossed for the entire interview. What does that body language indicate?
Wasn't a directive recently put into place to allow Military to use leth@l force against Americans?
Border bill? Imported millions of illegal immigrants then told us she did a border bill to block them?
"i actually don't what are you talking about?" lol!!
And why can't she speak about herself?? She can't say squat about herself!
20:30 Peaceful protest?  Like the looting and violence the left has engaged in repeatedly without consequence?
How can anyone with a clear conscience not see that she is  completely unhinged?
Trump's plan is to give more tax cuts to the wealthy? His proposals have been things like no taxes on tips, no taxes on car loans, lower tax rates on businesses that source their supply chains in the US... That's hardly a list of handouts to the 1%.
This chick is CRAZY!!!!! Just answer the question?
Has she EVER had even 1 good idea or thought of her own?
Huh… why then did the Biden administration authorize the military to use deadly force against the American people in our homeland- BEFORE this interview ever happened??? HMMMM!  Actually Madame Vice President, we have more and more concerns of your administration stripping us of our constitutional rights then any other entity…
Why are you asking questions if your not gonna listen to the answer. What a dumass interviewer. Might as well just monologue 😂
Quick question, why would America have to support Israel, and even consider it as the “most important things”?
When is Trump going for an CNn interview 🥹
Donald Trump was ALREADY PRESIDENT. Did he ruin the country then? Why would he ruin the country now? You're going to lose.
Do you think the NRA and gun lobbyists owe these families an apology?
Kamala has got plans for America? But she did not have any plan for America the past 3,5 years except her WOKE agenda, except defunding the police, except allowing more and more illegal aliens to come into America like killers, drugsdealers, rapists.
And people are actually going to vote for her?
Does this woman ever answer a Question Let’s be honest she hates even being asked Questions and her Brain only knows how to say it’s Trumps fault she has no backbone a Complete Puppet
good god. why ask questions if you're going to interrupt someone answering them?!?!?!?
Why does she always sound on the verge of crying when she doesnt cackle?
Where is the rest of Kamala interview FoX  American people deserve to know
Turn the page on rhetoric? 😂 The Dems are the worst at it!
What is Bret Baier doing?
Lets be clear how is this a interview when this bonehead did not let her answer a question? Fck trump and the maga i would never vote for a person that cant put two words together or lies, this is why i vote blue. All you suckers are just blind..
Anyone anyone at all watching this interview and listening to her talk about the reviews of her plan. Somebody please tell me any element of the plan anything at all anything at all. And not just a a headline the details of the plan how it will work who it will affect who will impact the most who will help if it will hurt anybody else what it will cost the taxpayers!? All of those things anything at all just one just
Why doesn't he let her answer a single question
How did tump dismissed them as headaches? Is he in charge of that decision?😊
So fox CAN ask questions! I thought this was going to be like when they interview trump where "what is your perfect sunday?" Is a normal question.
How can we trust her with Putin and Ayatollah when she can't even do a simple interview. She's weak.
Why would you call someone for an interview and then not let them speak and answer the questions you ask?
Also, why does she keep saying we as president?  Fraudian slip?? Is someone else presidenting with her?
This is a new SNL skit right?
Does she even know how to answer any question she is asked? Apparently not 😒
Penalties for illegal crossings? Flying them around the country and setting them up with housing doesn’t seem like much of a penalty.
Would the murderers have gotten into the country anyway? I guess we'll never know. But Trump's lackeys and worshippers sure seem to know the answer to a question that's impossible to answer.
Pardon my English, what does "clear" mean?
She wasnt grilled? Nothing was ate
I wondering why the USA is losing all its political relevance worldwide… is this their VICE PRESIDENT!?!?!? Oh boy…😮
In fact, does vice president have power to decide the any polices?
After 3.5 years she found the border???
Why doesn't she just admit they want an open border?
How many direct questions can one person avoid answering?
Locking people up who disagree?  Like Jan 6ers that only walked into the Capitol and walked out?
2:14 whats wrong with he neck ...it looks like skin is folded back along the sides and stapled down????😮
Let me ask y’all a question. Do you guys believe a word this clown says?
Why did Bret approach this interview as a debate? Seems because Trump lost his debate with Harris, Baier felt a need to do what Trump couldn't--win a debate.
why bother asking questions
Can someone go back and see just how many times she said Trump’s name?
how can anyone take talking in circles as an answer to a question and know that she has done nothing in 4 years. The buck stops here Kamala, own your failure.
How do you go through a whole interview and not answer anything? 😂
Did anyone notice she is wearing those earrings again? The ones that look like those bluetooth earrings? I mean, if I were accused of wearing earrings that could be Bluetooth earrings, I’d put the ones that look like any Bluetooth earrings in a box for the rest of my campaign.
Why do I just not believe anything she says 🤷‍♀️
did she actually answer any one question? blah blah blah all politico talk. Never actually answering anything.
Why she didn't do all these things being a VP? Either she was a failure as a VP or she is lying.
Why did he let her get away with not answering why she removed remain in Mexico. We are done if she gets in
60 million to Ukraine? For our border bill?
Who’s tired of rhetoric?…..  and who is tired of inflated prices, unnecessary wars, and open borders woke bs etc?
Does she ever answer a single question
What about the American experience?
Only Iran? What's about China? Not on her list? What's that mean? Is it mean that she will open door and welcome China after got elect?  Just like her party did many years ago
WHAT EXACTLY DID SHE DO AGAIN FOR THE LAST THREE AND ALMOST FOUR YEARS.
12:24 not a big issue!? 🤦‍♂️ she's sooooo warped 😅
Why is the actual interview the 20th result on Youtube search?
Why didn't Biden Harris keep Trump's border policies intact until they came up with a new policy
Were those polls taken from only 690 something ppl?
Does she know what she is talking about?
Why does he keep pushing her about Biden? Biden is not running for another term. I think Harris did a great job.
Do they forget that Trump stopped the law to detain undocumented immigrants in Congress?
That woman can hold up under a tough grilling!  Why did Trump block the border bill? It's a real question that deserves a real answer. Why? Ask it again.  Why? Nobody ever makes him accountable for his actions.  Where are the thousands of children separated from their parents and bused all over the country?  Where?  Where are the children?  Did his Epstein buddies traffic them?  Did he apologize to the families whose children were stolen from them?  Did he apologize to the families whose children died alone in cages?
Why do so many of your staff quit Kamala if your such a great choice???
How many times did she mention Trump’s name?
why did you cut the sound ???
Where our taxpayers dollars go is not significant?  REALLY?
Didn’t she call Trump supporters Weird?
Awe - Bless her heart! Sah cant talk about her policies because she doesnt know them, someone put onto her webiste - did she read them yet?
Why does she always sound like she has had a few drinks
Can she handle criticism?
Can he stop interrupting?  Or does he believe he has a right to talk over her because she is a woman.
Who should I vote for??
Why is it that left-wing, ultra-liberal politicians are just as ignorant and evasive in Hungary as they are in the USA? Go Trump, Go Orbán!
Where is she getting these fantasy accusations from?  She needs som psychotropic medication.
Obama could have picked a better puppet. Did his wife say no?
Was Kamala really a District Attorney in California?  She can't even answer direct questions
Do the national security advisors support the number of people that have come across the border? The same ones that say trump is unfit?
is this Dilma from brazil?
Why does she keep passing the buck.
Moderator: VP Harris can you tell the American people your favorite color?   Harris: Donald Trump hates the color green!
Why can’t these men be respectful? From Brett interrupting her as soon as she starts to answer, to tRump sexually assaulting women and mocking disabled people, and I could go on ! Why, why ?
What is with these clowns always asking about what a vice president has done while in office???  Please, tell me, how many vice presidents have EVER done ANYTHING of substance while in office....
How is this real
She couldn’t answer correctly without him cutting her off!! & he’s looking at her with disgust!! Is this is ok?
5 minutes in and she can’t/won’t answer a yes or no question of “do you ah e rgtets about how the border has been handled?”  🙄🤦🏼‍♂️
The Question On Everyone's Mind..... How to end government corruption & sends the power brokers packing?...“THE INSANITY ENDS” WHEN VOTERS VETO and RECALL POWERS BEGINS!....Control Law-Makers and the Oligarchs are History!
that's a GREAT question.... WHYYYYYY are 50% supporting evil?!!!!   How is she supposed to answer that.  Ya'll tell us!
How did Americans come to this in the same place...
She doesn’t demean people? Trump does? Why did she call 18-24 yr olds dumb?
How.many people think she couldn't and hasn't read those 80 pages? 👇👇👇
Do I dislike this video because she’s so bad or do I like it because they showed how bad she really is?
Does Kamala care enough to know any of her policies or does she have some staffer make up a bunch of talking points on her website.
What kind of biased questions are these?
God do her voters listen to these interviews!?
oh my god, the very first question cant be answered?? that was the point she needs to get to, what is the number?
Did she answer any questions?
He should have called her out on the McDonald’s lie  Why didn’t he? 🤦🏼
WHAT IS A $25K  DOWN PAYMENT GONNA DO TO A $400 K   HOUSE?
How can people vote for her
How long will we tolerate this.
Turn to new page from what?  Good question …. She is in office for last 3.5 yrs, not enough time for her to turn a page ?  Funny 😂
Question: Can you give any answer without saying Donald Trump?
WHY ARE THEY STILL TALKING ABOUT JOE BIDEN WHEN HE STEPPED DOWN?? It’s so stupid. It’s like ADMITTING you don’t have a point to stand on.
How much did they spend on her ads during Sunday football on fox
Is this interview about her or trump ? The obsession is actually scary now.
What has she done that’s good for America over the past four years? Name one thing. Anyone?
Did she answer just 1 question? 27 min for 1 answer? This is sad.
"Why did you invite these illegal immigrants to the U.S. offering them free healthcare our own citizens don't have?"  That would've been my first question.
Does she ever answer an ACTUAL question
Why is she continuously yelling at you? Sad to see this from someone that is running for the highest position of the land and she’s so combative 😳😳😳😳
How did she pivot from advocating for transgender surgeries in prison to strengthening the economy?
More support at the border? Wasn't Gov. Abbot of Texas that sent the National Guard to the border because the federal government wasn't helping?
Did her staff not get the memo after the debate that people were skeptical of those earrings? If she wanted to prove she could ad lib she would have worn something else.
IS SHE EVER GONNA JUST ANSWER A QUESTION?!!
Can she answer a question without beating around the bush?
How many more tragic cases are we going to have before someone does something about protecting our border.
Playing political games with the issue? She literally came out with a post the other day saying recreational marijuana use shouldn't be criminalized when her previous work as a DA in California says something otherwise. Had she acknowledged her track record and admitted fault and a change of view, people would understand it better. But that to me is playing political games. Lying to the American public so blatantly.
If Trump is so dangerous why are we on the brink of WWIII??
why are the American people his  enemy?  Seems to me it is teh obama and biden harris adminstration that is his enemey ... and probably a lot more in WA that when he gets into office hopefully we will find out why
Not a single sincere world … what doe’s she really think? Does anyone can tell?
I want to know if I will have a nice lawn? I don't ask for much, but I was wondering since I'm not in jail and have my own insurance, can she subsidize me so I can pay my landscaper? I  am middle class and deserve to have a really nice lawn, as do my neighbors so when people pass our home the will be in awe of our middleclass nice green lawns! UGH!
Why is it? That every single time a democrat is pressed by facts, they jump to labels and playing victim?
What is the medical necessity of a man in prison "transitioning"? Stop the clown show.
Why not do all the things she’s proposing now? Because she won’t. Trump 2024
Can you believe you go to an interview, where you get the chance to show who you are and present the case why people should vote for you. but all you do is blame your opponent and then at the end tell people to go to your website to find out what you are all about? How is this even possible
Trump guy here…can we admit that she destroyed any agenda Bret had?  She’s masterful
Why is this reporter not letting her answer?
Why can't she answer one question without blaming Donald Trump?
Did anyone else hear that smoke detector beep? Was this interview done at Kamala’s house or…?? 😂
Where are our body language analyst?
Is everything I say going to be deleted
Why the Kamala-Biden administration would want more border agents if they’re being asked not to detain, but assist ilegal immigrants to cross the border and to get help?…why?
80 pages of policies. That you can't name?
Guys…what’s a scorge?
Does she even know where America is on the map?  🤣
What plan????????? This monster will eat us alive
Without mentioning Donald Trump or citing him as a reason, why does one support Kamala, even after interviews like this? Whether the right or left conducts the interview doesn't matter with her.
Kamala wouldn't let Bret control her. What's up with that???
What a C U Next Tuesday! Gets nasty when she can’t answer a question…
What a sh*t job this Journalist did...ask the question, let her answer, we know who he's voting for clearly.??? What a joke
Who exactly did she “prosecute?”
Anyone noticed she only wears those earrings when she’s doing interviews and speaking events?
Her voice is annoying. Why is she whining?
Should have asked her how many drinks she’d had before this
Interview was 26 mins only?
US Citizens are sick and tired of politicians talking in circles trying to make excuses for problems…we have simple questions…”how many immigrants have been released into the US”…that is the question…answer it!  Is that acceptable? Is it sustainable?  How much is it costing us?  These are all really simple questions that can be answered easily but Politicians often do want to answer to the Citizens and often try to minimize the horrific downside of the allowing immigrants.  Putting a single Immigrants safety in front of a single US citizen should be punishable by law…if the system can’t regulate immigrants to allow in a manner that does not put citizens rights at risk then our government should not allow any immigrants until they can put American Citizens first.
Kamala fell apart, only thing on her mind rent free is trump. The question is what are YOU gonna do? Especially since YOU have been in office for the last 3 years.
Why do they trust him more than they trust you??????hmmmmmmmm?????
She does know that a decade means 10 years - right?  And that of 10 years, Trump was only in office 4 - and the dems were there before him and after him?  And then speak about pointing fingers at each other while she is pointing fingers at Trump?
How did she pass the bar?!? How did she actually become Californians AG??? The reason she was picked is she is degenerate puppet who doesn't mind spewing out nonsense.
who you lift up ? who you choose to lift up ?
Anyone else notice when she gets upset the demon face manifestation?! 😂
What a clown still hasn’t answered the question like always
She's got a brain worm?
what the hell is this Bret Baier guy thinking? HE KEEPS INTERRUPTING HER whenever she starts to answer a question!! Lmao of course she can barely answer; he's hardly giving her the chance!
Is this Estee Palti? If so she is totally brilliant. Harris is an idiot and not a happy one.
How sad. He never allows her to answer the question. Also, what disrespect!!
Grilled???😂😂😂 Fox and Bier got his a$& whoppped and handed to him
This lady cannot answer a question if it hit her in the face! How can anyone with a conscience vote for her???
Does she think we've forgotten that Israel attacked Iran first when they bombed their Embassy in Damascus in April.
Why does this woman say so many words but say nothing!!!!!!! 😢
Are they tryna fix the economy or just make it worse so trump has trouble like jeez please do your job woman
Is this Bret's first time doing an interview? Whats the point of having a guest on if you just keep talking over them lol
What, a 20 mins interview? And a 800 pages handbook??
What are the penalties for crossing the border, free resources to encourage more illegal immigration
Did she lost her black accent?
So when did you stop beating your wife? Yes or no please answer directly or I’ll move to the next question and talk over you while you are trying to explain.
She sounds like 🤔 “maranda” the character with the red lipstick…? 🫣
Do you think JD Vance had a watch party ?
who is paying for your ads ?? Ads must cost teh same for you as they do him unless you are getting free ads then one must ask if that is election interference ?
How come they’re in all these interviews she’s wearing the same pair of earrings?….. anyone else find that odd
How are you supposed to hear her policies if you won’t stop interrupting her whenever she makes sense? So irritating
Are you going to vote for a woman who flat out lies? She knew Biden was unfit
Why not ler her finish what shes saying? Shes here. If you're confident shes going to say something stupid, let her say it.
Did she answer a single question?
Does she only have one pair of earrings?
Why does no one talk about how that border bill wouldn't stop the flow? It would only release them into the country faster. I'm sick of them using that as a pass for undoing policies that worked
Frig i wish i were the ppl that get paid to advertise commercials...20 million for a 20 sec ad?  Im in the wrong business...
Does Kamela have only one pair of earring. Seems every clip of her, she is wearing the same earrings.
Sooo why were y'all suing Texas?
Anyone else notice that she's wearing her special earrings again? Does she not know that we know that she knows those are fake earrings.
Why does Fox and all the Trumpets blame Kamala for Biden’s doing? A Vice President is basically a figurehead that ‘supports’ POTUS.
Is she gonna cry?
Is she raised in a middle class family?
2:30 So why haven't you started doing all this? You've literally been 2nd in command for the past 3 ½ years. You're just spitting out words that you think people want to hear. You're a liar and as real as a Chinese Rolex. 😂
You are in prison not club med !! Follow the law ? Isn’t there a law that you cannot enter the US illegally? What law do you follow Kamala ?
Why she keeps bringing trump??
I’m 3 minutes in. Does he allow her to give her a single answer without interrupting her?
How anyone can watch this and still support her is beyond me.
Doesn't she realize that the economy was better when trump was in office?
Why is it so hard to watch the interview without pausing to take a break from the cringe?
If they claim to give every family who needs a home a $25,000 down payment, how will they afford this? They struggled to give families in Hawaii and hurricane devastated areas $750 with 0 physical support from any alphabet agency.
Who was that masked man?
How can you pay for more border control when you were giving that money to Iran at the beginning of the administration.
What right did Trump have to involve himself in the boarders bill… he doesn’t even hold an office….and his secret phone calls with putin… treason
Are you all ready to be unburdened by the burdening of this burdensome, "raised in the middle class" has-been?
Can someone please do a Trump count to see how many times she mentions him
Why do they never bring up the fact one reason the border bill was denied was because the Democrats added to the bill that Ukraine would receive 4.5 billion dollars in aid.
Where is Biden in all this?
Will she answer a freaking question!!!!!!!!!! She does not answer questions.
word salad.......   she'll go down with that name like Dan Quayle and Potatoe.  On one side she had nothing to do with running the country and the next she worked with all these people in the war room and with congress.   which one? hmmmmm    how about asking her about all the staff she fired?  Simple question.  If people can't work with you or around you.. you can't lead.
Did not answer one question. What a clown show
So Trump has more power in congress who is no longer the President than President Biden and Vice President Harris has to pass a bill?
She can't answer questions?
So what made Joe Biden go crazy ?
Why does she have the exact same ugly, huge pearl earrings on in the debate, in the 60 Minutes interview and in this interview?  This intelligent woman this she has a receptor in her ear with someone telling her exactly what to say.
In this case when you don’t get a straight answer just refresh the question example. How many immigrants released? answer A. 1 million B. 3 million C. 6 million what is your answer?
She can’t answer anything. What is wrong with her?
2:46 did she just call him the wrong name??
How is it possible that this lady was a prosecutor or at least obtained a lawyer's certificate? Something is very wrong here.
Is he interviewing her or himself? he wouldn't let her finish a sentence. Is this suppose to be normal LMAO
So if she’s not gonna have a mad deportation when she get in office, how is she going to get rid of all these illegal immigrants?
Is this an interview or argument? She argues with every question instead of answering, almost like she has no answers
Is former vice president never thought of he'd be up and running for president again either I'm sure he's nervous about his political career as well for obvious reasons
Anybody else get physically sick listening to her?
Who voted this lady in?Oh that's right nobody
She can't even answer a question. How can she possibly be in charge of anything?
i wonder if she knows if shes a woman or NOT!
Didnt her administration start 3 wars?
If Biden was so sound of mind then why did 2 new wars erupt during his presidency?
If trump is or was unstable then why were there no wars during his presidency?
Did she ever answer the question? What’s the number?
RIGHT EAR YOU KNOW WHAT THERE IS ? :D
Does she have an accent for each interview?
How do Trump supporters refuse to understand that Trump killed the bipartisan border bill. They tried to fix the problem they keep bringing up, but he would rather run saying there are issues, instead of fixing it when they can.
Are there people that would vote for more of this crap? Really people? Really?
how about why did you stop building the wall?
why does it always come back to their opponent? why not answer questions directly?
Guadalajara cartel hasn’t existed since the 80’s when exactly did she go after them??
How about an interviewer make her take those fake pearls off her ears so we can see how she would deal on her own .
So did she ever answer how many illegal immigrants they let it?
Do you trust someone who has ran a good economy or do you trust someone who has run a failing economy?
A child reporter with ADHD?
Why is she yelling at Brett? Shes big mad cause she didnt think it was going to go down like it did. Also, does she ever wear different earrings during interviews etc?
When has a Trump interview on Fox been only 26 minutes!! What? Are they afraid that she might get through to some viewers.
I wonder how much "They" paid him, under the table?
Does he have a real face? It looks like he had many jobs done in this area...
Interviewer: What are you going to do? Harris: Trump Interviewer: What are your proposals? Harris: Trump Interviewer: How will you change things? Harris: Trump Interviewer: What type of dressing do you put on your word salad? Harris: Trump
Can anyone here tell me Trump‘s policies? Not as talking points his policies I’ve been looking everywhere and I can’t find them. Or should I read Project 2025 to find them?
Did she answer any question?
So why did he not ask her if that water bill was so important? Why didn't you pass a clean water bill? Why did you stuff it full of pork for Israel and Ukraine? Instead, he let her filibuster.
WHAT ABOUT OREGON GIVING “NON AMERICAN “ 30,000.00 to help in getting their FIRST HOME ?
Why can’t she just answer questions direct. She’s always dancing 💃 around everything. It doesn’t take 10 mins to answer a simple question.
Why is it so satisfying to see Kamala crash and burn whenever anything approaching a serious question is being asked? BTW, anyone know how many times she brought up Trump?
Has anyone noticed Kamala wears less makeup than Trump? lol
Interviewer: What’s the number of illegal immigrants your administration has let into the country? *Kamala avoids answering question and gives long response* Interviewer: “Can you give us a number” And she freaking responds “let’s get to the point” and then doesn’t give a number still?? Him reasking the original question was him trying to get to the point. Can’t stand these politicians. They are so insulting to our intelligence.
Are y’all ok with the fact that Trump won’t disavow political violence. You’d think after an assassination attempt he’d stop talking like that but he can’t help himself.
Policies or goals? Because in order for it to be policy, it has to have a plan and a way forward... I don't think someone with your lack of experience can deliver such promises. If so, prove me wrong and EXPLAIN HOW!
If he or she can handle a tough interview, how can he or she take on a tough 'world'?
The real question is: Are you capable of the human feeling of regret and remorse, Madam Prosecutor?
Fun fact what was January 6th and was the military not supposed to be involved and calming down the American people?
is anyone seriously going to vote for this Lady?
Is this the full interview?
whose cackling now Kamala?
Was she expecting an interview or just another staged trump bashing?
Can Donald Trump make this many coherent sentences? Just wondering. Sound off in the replies
If his “plan” is to give tax cuts to billionaires then why are all the billionaires funding her? I am confused.
how is anyone even indulging this waste of space?
Why the hell did FOX allow her to wear her ear piece earrings?
This is her time to shine & questions are being asked like what have you done & what are you doing to fix the current issues madam Harris? And she keeps bringing up Donald Trump. Trump hasn't been the Vice President for the last 3.5 years! Honey, we clearly know what Donald Trump is doing; dodging bullets, fighting cases, & running for Presidential office. What are you doing besides blaming Trump??!
Was this his first interview?
All these plans are cool and all but there is two active wars being fought. Whats the plan with that? I don’t see why Ukraine gets our support like they do. And the Middle East is bigger situation than any one of us, it feels like something needs to give there.
Is she secretly talking about herself instead of Donald Trump? Because everything that she is saying about him I see in her.
why is it that left wing politicians never accept responsibility for anything they do?  It was clearly a mistake, take responsibility!  and why is it that left wing politicians always put the blame on someone else? congress, previous administration, anyone else...
Has anyone ever considered the reason people think the country is on the wrong track is because the division created by Donald Trump running his Putin filled mouth since 2011 beginning the birther movement, the culture wars, the name calling, the lying, lying, lying, and more lying?
Wonder why her pager didn't go off a few weeks ago...???
Why Hasnt She Disclosed The Amount
Why wasn't she asked about the billions Biden gave Iran 2 years back, this was the USA funding their enemy and who strengthens their foe before going to war with them.
Is this an AI generated long form Trump ad? No? Its real? Wow…
Lock them up??  Really is that why his rallies are so packed with people!!!🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
What’s the ad and cost have anything to do with the question? Her spending and ads are insanely more ads and more money.
Why she did she not noticed Biden declining health right away?  Why does she not want to talk about it?  She made herself look not smart by not questioning Biden's health for so long. 😊
Why is she talking so slow?
The American people wanted Joe Biden, not you?!?
So she has all theses plans…. Why doesn’t she explain any of them?!!😂 Trump 2024
So, why is she on the ballot?? And not Joe Biden?!?
Did I really hear her say “you have to take responsibility for what you do in your administration”?
Peaceful protest??? What riots was she watching???
Wow.  What did I just watch??
Why would you want wealthy people who have more money than the countries debt but liquidated be on the same playing field as middle class people they will eat all of us alive as we see already
If she so strong why did she refuse more debates?
2:19 Can I finish not answering your question?
It seems that she was sabotaging President Biden for over 3,5 years?
I swear she is HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!! WORD SALAD!!!!! She dodges the question I wish Bret would have went back and said is THAT A YES OR NO!?!?
Did she answer any question?
Hows it that Kamala Harris got "grilled"? is it only because the interviewer interrupted every 5 seconds? interesting.
I want to know if trump was better off inheriting President Obama's economy or Bush's economy? Y'all remember the mess he cleaned up after Bush in 2009 and economy  rebound he handed over to Trump??? What did Trump leave his successor??? He left a massive deficit and welfare to farmers AKA Subsidy and tax cuts to the rich. Dont forget the clown he was on the international stage as well.
What's with the disrespect?
If you watch all the Trump interviews - He gets grilled every time ! She can’t handle it? Is she really ready?
No way this is a President profile !! Where is her CV ???
Why go on Fox? What does she gain? This is 2024 she could go on a YouTube, streaming, or podcast channel and hit a better audience.
Did she give a number to the first question? Lol
Is she mentally ill or something?
Is there really no democratics in the comments lol i haven't watched the video yet but i dont see anyone saying she did a good job lol 🤣 oh my
Why did she decide not to answer the question and then said “let me finish”?
What is wrong with her? She’s a mess. God help us if this gets into office
Could she be more arrogant or condescending??
I wonder how much she spends on one ad.
That was it? THAT was the campaign ending catastrophe? The Disaster? The Great Implosion? After watching Biden and Trump flail about in interviews I'm feeling oddly disappointed at how OK she did.
Is she acoustic?
A broken immigration system? Who the hell broke it ? Stop deflecting and take RESPONSIBILITY brain dead freak!!
Does she know what we want?
Reporter: Madame Vice President.....how old are you? Kamala: It's Trump's fault I don't have an age.
What does she have to offer, other than talking trash about Trump?
I wounder if it's Obama in her ear or Hillary?
Did her nose just get longer about the border??
Can she say anything that isn’t a lie?
Is that the only set of earrings she owns?
Is it so hard to take ownership and responsibility of your poor governance over the past four years? I could respect her more if she would say I messed up, I’ve learned and it won’t happen again.
The weave?? Seriously, DJT
Where the heck does she think all this money is coming from?!?!?!!! HEY LADY!! FROM US, THE TAX PAYERS!!!😡😡😡
How does a 60-yr-old not have any idea how to pronounce “gouge” & now “scourge?” She’s so dumb!!!!
So what is she for?
What a disaster.  This woman tried to filibuster her way through every question.
Wait a second she's dropped her accent. Where did it go?
Why does my body recoil every time I hear her speak?? Why can I LITERALLY not watch her interview bc it makes me cringe every 3 seconds
"What are you talking about?"🤣
Why can't VP Harris ANSWER a question?? It's all deflection!
How come people don't believe her when hearing this?
Riddle me this: why does the left constantly talk about the rich “paying their fair share”, but never about those receiving government handouts and benefits DOING their fair share? Wouldn’t that also help reduce the deficit AND make our country more productive??   Just a thought 🤯🧐
Any one count how many ‘let me just finish’ deployments that was?
Why in the hell does she respond like a demented alcoholic kamala
Why didn’t trump fix the border when he had a red congress???????
Last 10 years? Obama was President 10 years ago.
Did she answer a single?
I may not know everything, but the need to increase housing - wouldn't that be caused by the millions that have crossed the border? According to Clinton, our birth rates are down, so new housing wouldn't be so needed.
After watching this interview I have to ask how could anyone support this clown? Please answer
Why doesn't the Senate vote on H.R. 2?
is this an interview or a debate? this host really likes to interrupt!
Does anyone know whether she has prosecuted trans-national criminals?
How can anyone be voting for Kamala?   Why is this even close?
Why not she goes back to her previous career? She compare everything to court cases
She's mentally broke. Can somebody please call the doctor for her?
Is everyone else on the edge of their seat? 😅
Lots of plans being offered.  How will they be paid for?
What the plan she keeps talking about? Im still waiting to hear steps . plan plan plan that's tall she says.
Is this an interview?
How does more border portal officers help if the borders are open anyway? Whats the point?
Why do you need a judge and a trail to stop illegal immigrates when you can just not allow them to come-in at the first place?
She cannot give a decent answer to any question !   She is so full of herself? Keeps going back to attack Trump & not answer any question asked?  😡😡😡😡😡😡
Broken immigration system? If the current laws are enforced there would be no problem.
How many fkn acts did she pass recklessly!
Why would Fox produces cut the interview why wouldn't they just keep going????
Did she answer any of his questions?
How did she get to where she is today??
What a joke! ANSWER THE QUESTION!!!
4:23 - isn't that five democrats?
Can she ever any a question??? stop talking in circles!!!
This is basically how the interview went:  Bret- What is your favorite color? Kamala- Well, Donald Trump hates the color yellow.
11:41  she says every in the clip, then says only medical when responding… so what is it?
I bought my house 8 yard ago at 25 years old, can I get 25k? What do I get for working and paying taxes and buying a house?
WHY was she not laughing?!!
Why does she always wear those same earrings all the time 🤔 Maybe because they're earbuds lol
What about BLM?😊
Why is her voice so whiny……
Ha! Any of you Republicans out there feel like shes on your side? Do you feel like shes lifting you up? I sure dont.
So she couldn't name any one of her policies that's from her website? 😂
How many questions did she answer?
Question...if he couldnt run/oversee his own University successfully...making sure students learned what they needed...why should I believe he is looking out for whats best for us regular people other than making his business friends more wealthy?
Is anyone surprised she can’t answer a question. Where the puppet masters so we can get real answers.
She’s offering small business and first time home buyers money. Trumps offering no taxes on overtime and no taxes on tips…. Hhmmm do you want a loan? Or do you want your money that you worked for so you can buy your own house? That’s pretty much the split.
Finally real questions on policy but like an AI machine no policy answers but to blame Trump on their policies of running the country and she wants to keep running those horrific policies as the first woman of color which does what for us?  Nothing.
Define middle class household?? 😏
Wow, was that a disaster.   She went from almost crying to overheated anger.  Why?  Because she had to answer a question?
She does realize Trump isn't the current president right??🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️😂😂😂
Can she answer a question?
Why did they let her do that? Wow
Peaceful protests like the BLM riots??
When pressed, she blames Trump. Trump has nothing to do with this. It is a Harris/Biden problem.
Iran… you mean the place that accelerated their nuclear program after Trump destroyed the deal that was keeping them in check? I’ve noticed a trend of him blowing up deals with the promise of a beautiful new plan that never comes making the issue worse. Let’s not also forget Trump assassinated Iran’s top military general in Iraq which has had us close to war with them ever since.
When I tell Republicans I am on the fence still, they ask questions, when I tell dems this, they lose their minds and stomp off.
17:52 projecting much?
Why didn’t she answer any question?
"What's the number?"  "Brett, let's just get to the point."  Sorry folks, she's an idiot.
Would you let me finish?! -  Kamala Harris
Is she trying to read his questions before he asks them?
How did she even get to this position? Only in America boys 😂 Scandinavia is laughing at this circus u call American politics
I wonder if you hold up a cross in front of her , would she hiss and run like a demon 😈????
11:03 but why? Ot don't make sense
What is this? The slaughter of jar jar binks😂😂😂
Did he ask her any questions about the her plan for the economy or healthcare or gun control?
Why does every election feel like deciding which leg do I saw off?
She isn’t looking at him.  Is she reading a teleprompter?
So using her words in an ad about taxpayers paying transitions for criminals is misleading? And basically she said even though he didn't have any done under his administration. She's saying it's in law so she would follow that law! Listen closely people.
yes kamala we know you get it first from willie brown & now from doug, so would you like to tell us who is better at anal?
Listen, I know this is off topic, but what the hell is going on with Brett's face? He looks like the love child of Liberace and a cat.
How come she didn't go on to have an interview with Maria bartiromo or Sean hannity, it would have been like Minnie Mouse going up against Mike Tyson.😭
Could Brett deepthroat the orange popsicle any further?
😂She can't even answer the question?
Does anyone have a tally on how many times she blamed Trump in order to avoid answering the question?
Why can't she answer one question? All she does is jump back to Donald Trump... her IQ level lacks
Why is he talking more than the person being interviewed? Respectfully… that’s not how it’s done.
This country is in bigger trouble than ever? What have or will you do better or different than the person you keep talking about VP Harris? 😢😮Praying for her!
If everything is Trumps fault then how do we trust her the next 4 years because it seems like she doesn’t have control over anything and Trump has all control?!
What's the plan? I don't hear the answer and she just threw the rainbow gang right under the bus!
Does kamala forget about Benghazi or Afghanistan withdrawal? Both under the dems watch?
What is with these men talking over her it’s out of control
Question for the Trump supporters: If Harris had said something like "look, we had a bad border policy, and we messed up, and now I want to fix, because we realize how big of an issue it is" instead of beating her way around it, would that be better or worse?
IVE NEVER HEARD SOMEONE TALK SO MUCH YET SAY NOTHING SMH.... HOW CAN ANYONE EVEN CONSIDER VOTING FOR THIS WOMAN?????
How will pay for it
Why is this goin on? Donald Trump Why are you not doing your job for the people’s benefit? Donald Trump Why are you delirious? Donald Trump Why aren’t people happy with your leadership? Donald Trump Now we know
Where does Brett Baier gets his NUMBERS from? If 70% of the population says the U.S. is on the wrong track, why is the presidential race almost neck and neck? At least 62% of the population think Roe v. Wade should NOT have been overturned. So obviously numbers don't mean anything.
How can she answer the questions when you keep interrupting her.
Wow, will you ever answer a question without making excuses and not taking blame for all this time you and Joe have done nothing??????
What kind of interview it is?, just try to blame them (Biden/Harris) the bad thing happen, when is well know Trump is a criminal who plays with the rules and if he is running again to avoid being in jail.
Why is her voice going to high and airy. It sounds like she is whining.
Could you please share your preferred candidate for the upcoming election? Your input will help us gain valuable insights into the potential outcomes.
Ayo German here 🇩🇪 I don’t get why as an American you’d vote for Kamala she just doesn’t seem to be qualified to become president why would the democrats even nominate her ??
Where can I read her plan?
didn't even answer the first question
11:45 does this apply to you too Kamala?
Anybody hear the smoke alarm at 18:22? 😂
Yeah, she was raised in middle class family and would like to solve all the issues, but how?
18:25 what happened to her voice? It suddenly dwindled down? Lol like clearly, she doesn't know how to answer for her shortcoming/absence during the past 3 1/2 years they've been in office.
Why is this guy so disrespectful
So this is what journalism looks like. Ask a question and if they avoid it, come back to it. She is a trainwreck. I'm in power but orange man bad (that's not in office) is really in charge for the last 3.5 years? hmmmm
Wearing the same earrings as she did in 2019 that were debunked as blue tooth earrings. Are they really not the same instagram earrings?
Did she walk out crying? If so how can she deal with the heads of other countries!!
But can she explain the policies on her website? I doubt it.
Really didn’t want to just let her speak huh? So many times in this interview he asked a question and started to cut her off after one word 🤦‍♂️
How people can vote for her is beyond me
Can anyone tell me why Kommiela Harris has only one pair of earrings? Look at every interview or debate, it is always the same earrings!
Question? “Tell me a number of how many illegal immigrants you think have crossed the border”  She can’t even give a number. What a joke.
well they both talked over each other, I think it was generally healthy discourse?
How is this not the first result when I search "Kamala harris fox interview"? Google is meddling again....
Does she know how long a decade actually is?  Out of a decade, we've had 6 years of democratic leadership.  Im getting nothing of any relevance from her responses
Did she answer any question????
Does she not understand how to answer a question? All she does is run around the question and keep bringing up Trump even when asked about Biden. How stupid is she?
Do people actually believe her lies?.
Omg, I'm supposed to vote for her?  I changed my mind, Trump has my vote.
Can she answer any questions directly? She reflected almost everything! 😅
Why ask someone a question if you’re just going to interrupt them while they answer? This is why I have a hard time with Fox News
Can she take responsibility for anything?
Anywhere i can watch the whole interview?
Was there a real straight forward answer in this interview? Didnt see one.
What a great question,   what are you turning the page from ?
Who is beating down who?
Support Federal Law can trump do that?
How long have they been trying to lock Donald Trump up now for disagreeing with the Democratic Party?
How to end your career in less than 30 minutes...
How much did you spend on some twirp, twerking on a stage?
What kind of an interview is this? I’m lost.
Anyone else clear on any of her policies? The only thing I know is her feelings about Trump.....
Didnt they just give NG permission to use lethal force against americans?
Why Is Kamala able to talk herself out of American concerns, and turn all her statements into emotional inspirational sentences, and generalizations  of hope, there’s no conclusion to anything she says?
Do we have a list of names of the large number of men who have been released in this country and committed heinous crimes? There should be a list it there is a record of arrest or charges.
How did she get where she is?She has the mind of a ten year old
Why are we not talking about the the unaccompanied minors that have gone missing and are now being human trafficked!
Can she answer a question?
He never lets Kamala Harris answer . What is this?
Chips and Science act? What is this?
What question did she actually answer here
WHITE Fox privilege didn't want her to answer the question. Why? Afraid of the truth
Where's the CNN fact checkers? Kamala needs them!
Is she finish class English second language???????Looks like she fail!!!!She don't understand anything ......
What the f did I just watch?! lmaooo
Do we have a list of names of the large number of men who have been released in this country and committed heinous crimes? There should be a list it there is a record of arrest or charges.
Can you give !!ONE!!! answer that doesn't start with or mention Donald Trump???
What is "assisanation"?
If you've done all that time prosecuting all these criminal organizations, why would you make it easy for them just to bring more and more drugs and more and more people in the country illegally?
Then why, V.P. ...are the EXISTING border agents now taked with putting the crosses on busses and sending them into the states? They are at least helping thee process, and kept from their former role of preventing this. Big question.
Did Biden/Harris policy on immigration work or made it worse? Made it worse...  Why you let them stay vs deporting. Which brought more illegal immigration because it was worth it under Biden/Harris administration to cross illegally.
her bill didn’t pass… so they get rid of laws trump put in place that were working as a way to help the immigration?!? And then also let in 6 million immigrants?!
24:00 why must USA defend Israel ? Is this their 51 state or what ? Is Biden/Kamala from Israel ?
If you interview someone, how about letting them answer uninterrupted?
Who heard her say 'burdened' and held their breath thinking she was going to continue with 'unburdened by what has been'?
Is fox going to go after tRump to have him apologize to the familys of over a million people he let die during covid?
25 min? That's it? That's all the time she has to change our minds? She failed! TRUMP! MAGA!!
He could have done so much better?
How many times did Bret interrupt the Vice President and not let her finish answering the question he had asked? Would he have interrupted and talked over a man that many times?
“Can I finish? I was just about to answer….” Continues to add more fluff words and dodge specifics…:.
Why do I get a feeling she was a bit high in this interview ?
This is an interview? He just constantly interrupted her.
And the answer is?
So... what are your Plans Kamala!!!???
How about she just closes the border? You won't need more boarder control officers, judges, etc.
Can she be quiet, listen, and then answer the question.  Wow!  Awful optics on her part.
17:22 Yo she gotta be slow? 😂
Who did he lock up during his presidency? Who’s been trying to lock him up non stop now? Geez
A solution she could still be working on seeing. She is the vice president. Why does it need to wait???
Where is your joy now??
Did she even answer one question without deflecting?
Can one person that supports her do a timestamp to where she actually answers a question?
Why she has not done those things ?
Wow…. Deflect much????
he asks a question and then before she answers it he starts talking again.  has this guy never done an interview before?
aw come on, she's not used to follow up questions, guys! doesn't she get points for showing up? give her a participation trophy.
Brett clearly had an agenda. Why did he even have her there if he was going to talk the whole time?
How can someone speak so much and say Nothing at all?
does this guy actually want to interview her? or just talk and ramble off cherry picked stats.  Let her speak dude you only have her for a short period of time.
Are these people in the comment section the same people that think's the election was stolen and that orange Trump is still president? It's scary how dumb you people are. You are the ones who need an IQ-test 🤣🤣
Why is she wearing an earbud, she need someone to give her the answers?
She left her black accent at home last night?
Who else ready for Revolution if this chick wins?
Is she running for the president of Israel?
Is she wearing her "special " earing???
This was an interesting interview but can you call it an interview because he was over-talking her? I'm sick of hearing trump deflecting and throwing insults. He had the opportunity to be the boss, and she has the opportunity to be staff yet you want to hold her accountable for her, not being the boss? American are something.
Who has been locked up since Jan 6th?  Under whose "justice department?  "Come om Man!"
peaceful protests? which ones? the ones where art museums are having to suffer thousands in damage? where protestors are blocking roads, stopping emergency vehicles from passing? the burning and looting of businesses? those aren't peaceful
anyone else notice that the "commercial ads" only start when she is starting to look bad? its never mid sentence... always right after he asks her a hard question
She keeps referencing Trumps rhetoric, demeaning slander..why every time I see her talk it’s her with the rhetoric and demeaning Trump? She is doing all she can to have him assasinated
Is she campaigning for Trump?
Why did Fox let her wear those Nova H1 audio earings?  Who was talking to her?
Is this his first ever interview? How was he picked for this lol he needs to hush up
But it’s been you extreme leftists who’ve locked people up and censored those who disagree with you?
How can she prosecute a cartel that didn't exist while she was practicing law? Haha
How is this "news"? Interviewing your guest into an impossible corner then just interupting and changing the question when a real answer is being given?
And she will speak like this with world leaders?...  Word salad, interrupt and speak over them, blame Trump, then get angry and aggressive to show her "Power".  Can you imagine what her "Word Salad" would be when translated into a foreign language?
Did she answer any questions?
Increase penalties for illegal crossings.  Does that mean criminal prosecution?  Does that mean jail time?  Does that mean family separation?
So is Iran a threat to Isreal or the US, I’m confused?
Does he interrupt her because his candidate is weak? This level of aggression from the host in the interview doesn't represent strength.
1:20 do you have the stats of what detained released illegal immigrants commited crimes?
What exactly is her plan…
Where did her Jamaican accent go?
Didn't  answer the question?
Why doesn't anyone ask her to remove her earrings before the interview?
How can anyone think that Trump is better than Kamala? All he does is lie
How is this woman even running 😂
What about insurance?? Why do we not get a choice in who we choose to care for our family? We're forced to pay for insurance but not free to choose holistic. If so, it's out of pocket! Ummm we pay into this, where are our freedoms?!
Iran? Not China
Why doesnt she answer? Lots of excuses. Just crazy.
27 minutes of incoherent rambling. What sane person thinks she should be president when she can't even put out a single thought of her own? That was clearly rehearsed with scripted talking points and she was coached on just turning it around to try to make Trump the bad guy and not what the current crew has fumbled their entire term.
What woman VP wears same earrings over n over?   Do an interview without u talking ear rings.
Will it go round in circles?
How do you stop a spoiled brat from screaming in the store- you don’t spoil them in the first place. You people are truly helpless
did she even answer one question?
Why do yall think some of trumps prior closest cabinet members and even his old vice president call him unfit for the presidency office. Wake up people!
the same earring with the ear piece huh?
Did people in the comments actually listen? Come on people.
Who locked up 100's of PEACEFUL J-6ers???
After this are people really voting for her ?
Turning the page....?
Do you think the American people believes on lies
This lady is very nice and confusing. Does she has the aptitude to think or words just spill out of her scrambled mind ? She caught the Biden disease. Sadly is non treatable. Go ahead and vote her in. Need another 4 years of Demo action.
"Why do you think they trust trump more with the economy?"   Kamala: its clear to those who study  Translation: they're uneducated
Do you think she talks like that with her friends and family? Slow and dumb sounding, interruptive, with dramatic hand movements and facial expressions?
Does anyone have the count on how many times she references Trump
How many is that???? Answer the question??
Can't she ever just answer a question... she dances around everything
I have a question for an American who's decided to vote for Harris..... Do you know what it's all about being the president of the US, or you're just voting on the basis of sensational politics and vagueness of being less informed? Do you know the election of the US presidents determines not only matters within the US but largely globally, and what happens outside of the US affects you significantly more than those outside the US? The presidency in the US is not about baby shower parties or discussing the American cuisines in the kitchens... It's more about facing the sworn enemies of the US like Iran, North Korea, China and Russia, and Donald Trump is the best qualified candidate for that job
Why pay for transgender operations?
What an embarrassment that she wont answer the question and wont take responsibility for their actions!
How can he possibly "let her finisb" when she talks entirely in run-on sentences?
Why is she not answering the question and putting a blame on someone that’s not in office??!
Why do prisoners need to be trans? Why do they need cosmetic surgery? They are in prison. They don't need crap. And she never followed the law.
Seriously! Questions about Biden? Did he get his questions from Trump's campaign team?
Has no one noticed she’s worn those Bluetooth looking earrings for EVERY interview and appearance since the debate???  No one is talking about this!!  Those earrings are too ugly for anyone to be wearing for every single appearance, unless they served an important purpose.
Why is Trump afraid of debating her?
Only 26 mins?
It's so confusing how some people can still support this babbling idiot!?!?!!?
Does anyone else notice the same  Bluetooth earrings?!? She does nothing for me besides raising my blood pressure! 😤
My god, could he ask a question and then shut up? We wouldn't stop talking over her.
Has no one noticed she’s worn those Bluetooth looking earrings for EVERY interview and appearance since the debate???  No one is talking about this!!  Those earrings are too ugly for anyone to be wearing for every single appearance, unless they served an important purpose.
So I went on her page, I can’t find her policies, can someone help me?
How can she stand herself lying all the time? She let them in before she was VP too!
Is this the entire interview?   Ive been searching for a while now.
Why does it sound like shes about to cry at some points
Whats not clear to you?   She had been much more specific re her policies.
She has been the boarder czar for 4 years!  Why do we still have a broken immigration system???
She can't answer a question??
No plan? Wow! She is disgusting
Ask a question and interrupt the answer. Again and again. Is he afraid of Trump’s disapproval? Afraid of a spanking with a magazine? Because this is pornographic and Donny Puny Dong is panting. You’re not posturing for a side in Congress. You’re a pretend journalist for a partisan propaganda machine.
Hold on a second I’m confused, so her being the sitting vice president, Donald trump who is not currently in office, had more power to block a bill than she did to pass one?
I’m so sorry for her loss… BUT….  But? But? God forgive me… for I have no words to express how much I hate this woman.
I wonder why trumps amazing border wall didn't keep immigrants out like he said it will. Obviously his immigration solution didn't work.
Genuine question for those who say “she had 3 1/2 years” - what specific problems did Mike Pence fix in his 3 1/2 years as VP? Do you expect JD Vance to be able to overrule Trump on immigration, economic, or national security policy where they disagree (and they do disagree - Vance has been clear even post-reversal of his view of trump that his own opinions are different)?   In fact I would genuinely like to know, of any example, that anyone has, of a vice president being more responsible for any economic, immigration, or national security issue than the president?   I don’t remember any president running for re-election saying “oh that policy wasn’t mine that was my VPs”.   Come on guys, I support healthy criticism of her record - but you need to look at her record as an attorney general and a senator to make those points hit. If you focus on her “record” as VP then you’re not getting anything out of it because no one actually believes the VP has that much power.   The job of the VP - the actual job - is to be a “spare” in case of emergencies, and to go do some soft power handshaking with people who the president doesn’t want to deal with. That’s it.   If you all really think the VP has that much power then you really should be defending JD Vance more on his policy differences with Trump.
was he rude at beginning of interview me and co worker arguing over this question
I'm sorry, how does any of that help the "American" people?!  Broken immigration law? What specifically is wrong with it and how has what you've done  that would improve the law!
@21:27 Is she wearing devices in her ears so she can get help from her team?
Is he interviewing or dictating?
I wonder what if it was Tucker Carlson who did the interview??? 🤔
Are you guys scared of mexicans?
Very clear? About what?
How could it even be this close? Wow what an imbecile
Sometimes I am just wondering who are those who go in her rallies?! How can you even listen to her filibusters and word salad’s without getting a migraine 🤦‍♂️
What did Mike Pence do? I'm waiting
Gordon Bennett. This is a political leader???? She can’t answer a question presumably because she doesn’t understand it. Alternatively, she wants everyone to see only what she sees. Either way she represents doomsday on this performance.
She don't demean american people? Like there isn't a video of Kamala saying the 20 year Old Americans are stupid. I can't stand her lies.
Can we get a list of the republicans that are supporting her?
22 minutes in, and she still hasn't answered 1 question...... really?
Is she incapable of giving and actual answer? 😅
The framing of all these questions are attacking the Democratic Party in a way that’s insanely biased. What happened to fair and balanced?
6:57 what????
How much money did y’all spend investigating Trump? You got a number for that Kamala.????????
How did she get these positions.
Can she please answer a f****** question
How much money did y’all spend investigating Trump? You got a number for that Kamala.????????
Why is it so hard to answer a direct question. She had an opportunity to explain to people some of the allegations being levied against her and instead of providing a detailed answer about policy or stance, she avoided the questions and shifted all responsibility to someone else. Also, someone has a temper.
Where’s Kamala’s joy??
Does she know how to answer a question? Well she ever admit she and biden made a mistake.
Why do we coddle people in prison
If you blame the former president for your failure the past 4 years, what's our guarantee that you won't keep failing and blaming it on the past if we elect you again?
Is she raising her voice 👀👀???
If more resources would've fixed the problem, shouldn't the monies given to Ukraine and others have been put their first?
FOX - MADAME VICE PRESIDENT WHAT IS YOUR ANSWER?  HARRIS -TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP!!!
A new Generation?  What am I? Old generation? Do I not count? My way works for me. I’m not turning any pages or corners.
At what point can we hold this administration for treason? All of them.. anyone who had a part, a piece, or a vote.
Omg what a joke. How can you ask a question, and then try to answer it for her every single time? This was not an interview
She’s showing up for interviews, Trump isn’t. Why is that?
When asked about the US threat she failed to answer. She put Israel in front of us.
Does she know how to answer a single question with clarity. She is absolutely not answering all the questions.
Is anyone else tired of "protecting" the world?
Why does he not let her speak out??
Does she have any answers that don't include Donald Trump?
Where was Leslie Knope born? When we come back we are gonna pull out a map and speculate WILDLY.
Why does major Countries all have a Problem with Illegal Migration?I wonder why?
When she can’t answer a question she just tries her best to prevent him from re-presenting the question. 😂
Just go to her web page & read. Then maybe the answers to your ? Will be answered. If you truly want answers….
Yeah 6 democrats voted against, but how many Republicans voted for?
Did she say anything about what she has done for the last 3.5 years, other than that she was in the situation room a couple of times? That's it? That's all she's done?
Are her earrings JUST earrings to help her answer?
BB: What about immigration?
Border wall or 1,500 border agents watching miles of concertina wire???
Is she doing her best Obama impression?
Why do we have to listen to her??
Where is she getting all the money from to do the things she says she is going to do.  Answer the questions!!! Go trump!
How did former President Trump stop a bill? He was being accused of attempting a coup at that point in time. How did he have the power to tell congress what to do? It doesn't even make sense.
Dang they’re letting her off her leash?!
Is everything always a lie? Talk about trying to run the clock out, on few questions as possible.
What’s up with this so called “hard rap” what’s more important than interviewing a presidential candidate? Why are they letting her off the hook?
Can she answer one question? Instead of scooting around every question 😡
Does she ever answer a question?
can someone tie her hands so she doesnt scratch his eyes out
Who in their right mind thinks she did well?
Is she capable of answering a question without saying the words "look" or "donald trump"?
Shes awful. She is a narcissist because that is exactly what they do, triangulation. Is she scared that her husband will beat on her if she says the wrong thing or are we seeing the real intelligence and character of the woman who slept her way to the top?
what plans, she has never put out any plan on anything!
Am I in power? wow I didn't realize that I am in power
Why ask questions if you know you're going to continually talk over the person that YOU asked lol like does he just like the sound of his own voice? 😂
Is this an interview or a roasting session? The amount of time this dude is cutting her off is wild
Trans national Criminal gang? Ok? Fair if you prosecuted them... Who are these Gangs? Any info.
"Are you still in support of using taxpayer dollars to help prison inmates or illegal aliens transition to another gender?" is a question I never thought I would hear in my lifetime.
Can someone explain to me how giving a one time payment of 25,000 dollars to a limited number of people going to grow the economy?
How is it that she and Biden continue to push lies, falsehoods about Trump which are misinformation and disinformation but Republicans and Conservatives give them a pass?
What about making it possible for Americans to be able to afford food and medicine.
Does she have demenca also
Those earrings are ear pieces, they may have be altered to not look like the original, easy to do.. she wears the same pair everywhere…. What woman does that???    Obama in her ear… you can tell she is trying to repeat what she’s being told.
Why is no one pointing out that the border bill WOULD NOT STOP ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS.
Democrats, is this the best y'all can do?
Who has good comments for Dirty Knees Paris ???
Why not ask about the billions that have been sent to other countries?
How many time does she actually say “DONALD TRUMP” in the interview.
How come this woman can lie so much?. She is a disgrace and she should be investigated and prosecuted for treason and corruption charges.
She has notes allowed?
is it racial to get a job just because of being black
Could you let her answer a question? Who is this turd
How are we not addressing that she wears the same ‘ear rings’ to the debate and any potentially difficult interview? How???
I'm so sorry BUT?! thats not an apology !
Can anybody watch Candice Owens multiple investigations into Kamala Harris and her family and all of the facts based with actual documentation that she has lied her whole entire career?
If Kamala Harris couldn't even stand up against Joe Bidens bad policies and decisions, how will she be able to stand up and stand strong against Iran, China, Russia and North Korea??? Something to think about!!! Or will she just hide away and blame it on Trump???
Can someone send this video to @taylor swift?
they want support, but I took away their support in the beginning .... what is the problem?
Can someone address the fact she showed up 15 late. So the interview was short then it should have been. And that why she used world sales to drag out time.
WHAT THA HELL was all that....
Can we get a count on how many times she said “Donald Trump”?
Did she answer one single question?
“I will tell them I am so sorry for their loss??? “But I’m not sorry?! And I don’t owe them an apology? Total pig!!!
Is there really somebody in there right mind that looks at this woman and thinks she is really gonna do something better than what she has done these last 4 years???? She is a joke.
How many is que question and the point, so it should be answer with a number.
Does anyone else know if immigrants are American people?   Thanks in advance
Do you know any of those policies Kamala?
What if Trump actually becomes a dictator? What is Project 2025?
Are those the Bluetooth earrings from the debate?
Why can't we answer some questions here below??
She is very obscure for everything. Is that a talent proved by American people?? She must have been rather a philosopher…. 😊
What do Camilla and Olive Garden have in common? Never ending salad.
Can someone direct me to a clip where Trump said he would throw the military to whoever criticized him?
How is she supposed to answer questions when he wouldn’t let her get a word in LOL
Why is Brett being such a jerk? He is not being himself at all.
She ran for president in 2019?  Thought that was Biden and she was just running as VP which that position has no real power to do anything 🤷‍♂️
Where are all the Kamala voters???
Here’s my concern, if Brandon is unfit to run as president for a 2nd term why is he still president?   Why has Harris not taken over a president?  She hasn’t because she’ll be even more exposed as a flunky.
She can not answer the question. What is the number Madam V.P.?
What could be at the border, unburdened by what has been.
How many years have democrats held office??
What about all our kids killed by Americans while they sit in school learning. I am so sick of this lying republican gun lovers that don’t give a dam about the children of the U S A.
Is it just me or did she played a part of the clown on maximum overdrive
Can she answer one question without bringing up Trumps name?
Wait. Isn’t your party trying to put Trump behind bars?
Some say she prosecuted only 10 cases in her “career”?
For someone that can't answer a single  question,  she has alot of things and lies to hide!! Why don't reporters  ask her "have you ever in your life answered  1 question "? 😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
Is anyone voting for her?  Honestly who is voting for her?
Didn't she put someone in Federal prison for 3.5 years for a PEACEFUL protest? Bevelyn Williams- charged with unlawful assembly for praying on the sidewalk.
Can she hear herself speak?
Why would she take this interview? Lol she looked terrible!
am I the only one seeing Obama speaking? The hand, head movement the way she talks is filled with Obama's way of talk lol... Obama really spent a lot of time teaching her and Clinton lol
She's wearing the special "earrings" again... who is talking in her ear?
What a Fing wanker he is…asks questions and doesn’t let her answer them.
Question One: How many illegal aliens were allowed in the country under your administration? Answer: It was congress's fault. "Leadership consists of nothing but taking responsibility for everything that goes wrong and giving your subordinates credit for everything that goes well.” Game Over!
Does she have any idea how much people despise her
What have you done lately?? 😮
What kind of journalist can’t let an interviewee answer the question?
Why is she still wearing the same ear phone ear rings. Let's see how she would do without her sneaky ear piece.
Why can't anybody just answer the question Yes or no.
She tightened things to stop illegal entrance?  Really?  Maybe it would help if she gave her definition of “illegal entrance.”
how did this people get to be state attorneys and high profile policticans ?
Everything was but Donald Trump..but Donald Trump .....???
Does she actually answer a single question in this?
Can everyone see the thumbs-down on the video? I can only see the number of likes but no dislikes.
Is Britt working for TCN Buy hasn't told Fox just yet?
If your tired of demeaning talk from Trump, why do you keep talking about and running down someone?
Does anyone else notice that this isn’t the first result when you search it up on Youtube?
Who in the world wants to read your 80 pages🙄
Will she send all the murderers, rapists and child molesters back? Or keep paying to let them stay here in luxury?
What about Joe?
How can you be Vice President and not realize that we live in a representative Republic? We are not a democracy!!!!
The quoted statistics bewilders me as I am a 40-year-old American citizen & have never been asked those questions by a representative of the U.S. government. Are the percentages that Bret mentioned factual or made up?
Why is she pretending she’s not second in command of the United States? Everything she says she’s gonna do she could’ve already done.
Can she answer one question without saying Donald Trump's name?
Does anyone else find her voice to be absolutely annoying?😫
What kind of dressing would you like on that Kamala word salad? I can't stomach this lady.
How the heck is she in charge of anything!?!?
Could anyone give constructive criticism on Trump? Is he a flawless candidate?
What’s your plan, woman? What is the plan?
She's so weird. Why the fake white accent?
Doesn't she look tired?
My question is when would Donald Trump step into an “unfriendly “ territory and grant an interview?? He his out there accusing everyone of a witch hunt 🤦🏽‍♂️Well Done 🙌🏽👏🏽 Madam Vice-president.
Is flying 30,000 illegal aliens into our country flying them over the border 30,000 a month so that they will not be counted and they want to cross the border on foot 30,000 a month she knows what that number is it’s 20+ million since she’s been in charge of the border
I tried to watch but I can’t stomach her. Was she horrible as usual?
Why not take more time and let the lies come out and contradictions pile on.
WT actual F?   Everything she said was not just an outrageous lie, it was an obvious lie.   Trump has done none of the things she claimed he 'threatened' to do, rather her party has actually done all of them for real.
What's the point of more agents when they're not preventing people from coming in??
If you get what the border control is going through, why are you making their lives so hard?
Is any politician honest?????
Are all those little pauses her trying to listen to her earrings? Lol
Who the hell is voting for this ???
What a moron Camilla is, literally couldn't answer one question.
Is Fox News a legitimate news service or just a front for  Trump?  Is Bret Brier a serious interviewer or a  Trumpian stooge?  This interview was not  what informed voters needed.  It was just horrible and combative from start to finish.  Shame on Fox News management team for doing such a horrible job 🤮
But...the QUESTION IS ...." DID SHE USE A VIN DIAGRAM to come up with her worthless plans" ????
Does she not own a different pair of earrings?
Kamala, Do you owe those families an apology for the murders of their daughters?  Are you continuing to fail U.S women?
Why does Kamala have to apologize for those three girl’s murders? Shouldn’t the murderers apologize for their crimes?
You mean all the people he fired found him incompetent?  Strange huh.
What has she been doing the last 4 year...?
The correct question to ask is “why do you hate this country?”
notice the earrings? If they were the special type, they sure didn't help - same earrings she wore during the trump debate
Where was my 25k down payment?  All I got was an 8% interest rate. If I would have known better, I would have bought a million dollar home in 2020..
Is she going to have a shaking voice talking to Putin, too?
Did she offer salad dressing with that toss?  FKH and FJB, Femall
What is this? You're asking her a question. Wait till she answers.
🤪I am so confused if she has all these plans then why weren't any of these plans initiated during their administration? 🤷🏾‍♀️😂
Is she high ?.. like maybe a glass of wine and and a Xanax 🙄🤷‍♀️🤣
Doesn't answer questions only wants to filibuster and bash Trump
And why is Trump any better?
Who is "Tim Walls"?
Excuse me...WHO has been demonizing the American people? Last I checked her administration has been calling Trump supporters horrible things and jailing grandmothers for years without trial for being given a guided tour of the whitehouse......
When did she notice that Biden was losing it mentally? Haha, what a bunch of avoidance! I noticed that he was mentally unstable while he was running for office. My doctor did, too, and was furious that they let him run.
Did she have an earpiece and teleprompter again?
What a great question - what will you turn the page on ?’ You were the vice president …
This is a joke on her part, right???
How do they know the number of illegal immigrants in the country, if they are illegal? How did they count them? Lol😂.
Is she still wearing the same earrings?
Follow the law introduced and passed which the POUS can veto?  This woman is not fit to be POUS.
Turning the page in the last decade from what? Trump?  Democrats have been in power for most of the decade, and what have they accomplished? What will changed under your administration Kamala?
Was this an interview or a debate? Another terrible job by Fox News.
great question when did u notice biden was losing his mind ? cus u just might be blind lady
So when is DJT going on MSNBC?
What about the 325,000 + missing children ?? 😭😢
Wasn’t they in charge 9 months ago?
Why does she never answer a question straight on…feel like she tryna play me like I’m stupid
Why doesn't she attend a session with her press secretary and take questions directly from the press and talk all she wants and see what happens.
So if the economy is bad because of Trump, then how would a recession in the middle of next year be Trumps fault?  Wouldn’t that be hers and Bidens?  🤡🤡🤡
Who taught her how to be this stoo pid? My GAWD SHE IS GREAT AT IT!!!
Fix the  problem ? You are the problem !!!!
Can she answer a simple question without a long winded word salad?   And just think people will still vote for her.
Should of asked her what’s the cbp one app
Finally a reporter that asks though questions. I’ve learned that she can’t be trusted and let’s say something goes horribly wrong if she’s elected then who’s she going to blame???? That’s all I heard during this interview
Anyone know how OLD donOLD is?  Anyone seen his birth certificate?  Was he born in Kenya?  I'd bet he's at least 93.
What makes gender reassignment surgery a medical necessity? What the inmates need is psychological treatment. They are doing this to get sent to a female prison. Partly for safety and easy pickings!
Are those her magic microphone earrings?
Is harris so delusional she does not realize SHE is the ENEMY within
Let's see, a choice between a seasoned Prosecutor or a Convicted Felon Rapist?  I'll stick with the Law.
why does she ALWAYS wear those EARRINGS????
Why do we have to pass a bill why cant we just enforce the laws we have?
How is trans.gender surgery a necessity??
How is Thousands of illegal immigrants coming in droves Trucks and everything if it's so much border control smh make it make sense
What is up with this comment section -- were we watching the same video?
Wait😮 what just happened? Did Brett just called us stupid? Am I wrong or did Brett bear just call us stupid for voting for Trump?
How is it that a CONVICTED FELON can even be considered to be president?  Isn’t it true that he would not be able to receive top secret briefings? He’s a disgrace.
Who coined the term "deplorable"?
Is Brett Baier auditioning for Trump's spokesperson?
Going after people that disagree with you like putting Gabbard on a watchlist? Hmmm, Kamala?
Wait....is this her real voice finally...????   20:23
How does a broke government offer anything but budget cuts? Beyond me
What is crooked kamala gonna do to win the hispanic vote? Pull out her phone and play a latin song to a crowd like crooked biden did?? 👎👎👎
But what are her plans? I am really struggling to find anything of substance.
Have you noticed scamala wears the same earrings with every interview???😳😳🧐🧐
Question what is the chips and science act????
Can she let me know where my loan relief is that I was promised 4 years ago?
What did she do as vice president of America?
Is Brett on the ballot? Fk me, he spoke more than she did. Faux News at its finest, showing what a propaganda joke they are 😂😂😂. They've inadvertently helped Harris, so I'm much obliged ✊🏾
Why do so many prominent Republicans and people that worked in the Trump administration support Harris now?
Never can answer the question, can she? Earpiece must not be working.
How is she going to sit down with world leaders if she can’t even handle a simple interview ?
Where’s the full video?
Did she answer any question asked?  Deflect deflect deflect!
@rmfreeman1987 Hold president trump accountable how? By holding him in legal battle witch-hunts while perfectly aware he’s attempting to run for political office? I think that’s called prosecuting your political opponent, something reserved for Russian politics.  Your inability to see you’re the monster discontent with anything short of his head on a platter is more of the problem than his bombastic speech patterns, also, umm, look at the economy, prices, crime, etc.
Does she EVER do anything except MASTUBATE with words????
Spending American taxpayers' money for illegal migrants not dividing the country?
Can she just answer a question straight forward without spewing a bunch of nonsense? How could anyone want her at the negotiating table for us!?
What's wrong with his face? Was he in a fire?
How about all the money you spent on ads telling your lies..
What is with this guy constantly interrupting her?
Why hasn't she got a red lipstick dot on her forehead like her mum n dad ? She should be proud of her pakistani izlmists heritage no? 😊
Why haven't you stepped in against Iran? Because you have personal interest
Why is the interviewer over talking Kamala ?
Who raised this guy to think interrupting and talking over people is good manners?
Is anyone else reminded of the Monty Python arguement clinic skit? Where he just denies everything they both know is true?
Absolute CLOWN. Did she answer a single question he asked? Also, why does he have to 'let her finish' but she can interrupt every sentence?
People are exhausted of Donald Trump, or are exhausted of the portrayal that the fake media has done of him and the people finally have seen through all the lies? This woman is a disgrace!!!
So how come she or Biden didn’t turn any pages last three and half years ???? Everything is Trumps mistakes still ???
People here have listened to Trump, his fear mongering and hateful speech, and they don't like what Harris said? Conservative suckle on fear and hate. Work of the devil?  Pretty sure Jesus would support how Harris speaks. Trump only talks of hate and fear. Devil's work.
Who the heck is she yelling at and wagging her finger??
Isn't 'transitioning' an elective surgery?  She'll follow the law.  oh, great.
If immigration is so important then why did Trump turn down a bipartisan bill to protect our borders?!
God? Is she really potentially our president? God bless america
If  Trump is so bad then why is half the country supporting him and why is he beating you in most swing states? Its an election, its not supposed to be easy..... Um, okay....
Ooo .she trying to look mad! Lol what happened to Joy??
Why did she put thousands of illegal immigrants on buses and send them into American cities if she was trying to stop them
$25k for first time home-buyers? $25k in the Midwest is much different than $25k in California or New York. Do first time home-buyers need to move into the Midwest or will something be done about the out-of-control housing market in these other states?
What is the plan? Thats what I want to hear.
You mean like how they turned the FBI was turned into American citizens from Jan 6th??? Ppl that are just standing in a  crowd outside who didn’t even go inside the capital building??? They were involved in peaceful protest!! But look at all these liberal protest burning crap down in 2020 or all these Palestine protest and NOTHING HAPPENS!!!
Could she just take responsibility and answer the question! She beats around the bush too darn much!!
Does she believe the bs she says?
So you got to break it to fix it, Kamala?
Is there any presenter on Fox News who hasn't had rather terrifying plastic surgery.
Can she answer a question
She seems to be offering a lot of plans but doesn't seem to be telling us what the plans are?
Is this the first interview she doesn't get the questions beforehand? My respects for this brave man 👏👏👏
Kamala, how does it feel to be in front of a real journalist for the first time??
How can you blame Trump when he hasn't been president for the last 3 years?
If she's against Iran so much, why is she putting the election first over Israel?  And why do her policies support the victimization of American citizens, especially those in the universities that are being funded by Qatar?
What the hell  she talking about she always deflects to Trump she helping his campaign with her banter of word salad stupidity
She is so dishonest, she sidestepped just about every question asked of her. Can you imagine her having to meet with foreign leaders? How can she be trusted?
Is she talking about when she allowed people to hop on buses and sent them throughout the country?
Does this woman ever answer a question directly, queen of digressing from the point to avoid accountability and using false accusations in blaming President Trump for her administration's failings.
This guy does not know how to have a conversation. How did he get this job?
Why can’t she recite those 80 points?
She just rambles, also try’s to blame everything on trump, but yet when trump was in office life was great! Hmmmm?
When is a gender reassignment surgery EVER medically necessary? These people are deranged and there’s a special place in hell
Why didn't they keep Trumps bill in place?
Is she going to answer a question?
What is your favorite color? Instead, let's get to the point.Trees are green the sea Is blue and i'm just terrible
She has her debate earrings in... who you think she is listening to?
When asked if she still support a law,, the answer should’ve simply been no.. Admit to your mistakes!! Dang!! Can’t trust this woman..
How is the media gonna allow her to wear the SAME Bluetooth earrings
Was there a single real answer in this whole interview?
As a home builder, I’m not sure how she will bring more housing supply 🤔….. does she know how to lift a hammer?
Why won’t she just drop out of the race and do what’s best
Is she gaslighting herself too?
Do any of these political puppets answer a question or take accountability for their actions.
How is it people can vote for someone who had almost 4 years to fix this crap and all she did was turn her back on this country?
So Joe Biden was an experiment? Freudian slip? 🤔
So Joe and Kamala wanted to pass a bill to fix the border. Really? How then it turned out they opened the border after that? Not buying that bait
How are people listening to this and hearing nothing? Are you deaf?
Who voted you in to represent the "democratic" party? Where the he'll was democracy with that decision?
She can’t even handle an interviewer , how is she going to handle very intimidating leaders ?
Decade? - 6yrs was democrats in charge! Can’t blame Trump for the last decade!
How many people are suing Trump? How many were suing Trump when he ran the first time?  Only 1 or 2 people were sued more in our country. He does not pay for anything. He says he will but he lies. He never folds..he rolls with the punches..waits to see if he wins.
What did you fixed the problem in 3 and half years ???? You fixed nothing at all.
Any fox news viewers convinced to vote for Kamala?
Fixing a problem?? You made it worse. You think we're stupid. Get them out of power
What kind of Q&A is this? She didn't even dance to avie maria & YMCA for 40 minutes. NO ENERGY!!
Also what other country when you do finish all their paperwork to get into their country then subsides that immigrant with tax dollars like housing , incentivizing businesses to hire them perhaps with tax incentives , Housing vouches , phones , transportation? NOT the 2 I researched you had a have a savings of certain amount, a way to support yourself when there , a place lined up to live,  I think it was France that even required you to have a French Citizen that would help you .  ANd no criminal record.  And it took a long time
Is it really that hard to send more border agents to border.shouldn’t take a new bill
The last decade, Democrats have been in office 6 out of those 10, right? What page are they turning again? Trump has been living rent free in their heads, though...
Over the last decade 6 of those years was under democrats sooo ?
Why do they call it the Biden-Harris administration? We don't talk about the Trump-Pence administration or the Obama-Biden administration. Harris is just a vp not the POTUS.
17:42 the last decade? Obama has been in office from 2008-2016. Trump 2016-2020. Biden 2020-2024. So we had 12 years of democrats and 4 of republicans over the last 16 years
Can she answer a simple question?? All she do is thinking about trump😂😂 what a joke
Is she REALLY that damned stupid?
Wouldn't be the smart thing to just write a bill that added 1500 border agents and nothing else? I mean what I am sick of is politician adding a hundred plus things to a bill when they say, look we can all agree on 1500 border agents. Then reject it because of all the extra garbage.
The only real question here is does the U.S. want a self-proclaimed WANNABE DICTATOR, Trump, , , or anyone, ANYONE who does NOT WANT TO BE OUR DICTATOR, or ANYONE who did NOT SAY they want to TERMINATE OUR CONSTITUTION?
Trump stole how many boxes of classified documents?
Did anyone else notice a Freudian slip by Ms. Harris when she referred to former VP Joe Biden’s “experiment” and then subbed it with “experience”?  Perhaps the installed Biden regime was an experiment in many ways toward morphing our Constitutional Republic into a Marxist dictatorship.
Is she yelling at Brett?   She completely lost her cool.   She was practically pointing her finger at him.   She should be ashamed.    She came for an interview and then got mad when they gave her one.
Is it just me or is she extremely delusional?
@Jrose3144 Milley has never been right in his life? That seriously brings into question Trumps judgement then, for appointing him Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff…..I would think long and hard about supporting a president that has that poor judgement when appointing his staff.
Where were the fact checkers?
What is she waffling about?😂
Did Kamala make it a short interview or was it Fox News?
I wonder if she's good at dodgeball too? Dodging all these questions... 😆
What happened to his face?
Who could actually vote for that????
Does she ever answer a question?
Turning the page from the last decade…..maybe she doesn’t know exactly how long a decade is? Her people have had the White House for the majority of the last decade. 2014-2024 has 6 years of Democrats and 4 years of Republicans. So….
Are they the only earrings she owns, never wears any others, we know what they are! Thanks Brett for asking real questions, clearly she can't handle them with any intelligence.
How many times did she bring up Donald Trump?
Then why is democrats given the money comphad it taken care of when he dropped that giving them money and look what happened?
Am I the only one that thinks she was drinking? She was belligerent. She slurred some of her words. And her team wanted to get her off of there in a hurry. It can’t just be me that wonders about this.
How can anyone look at her and deem her fit for purpose, is beyond me. She’s a kind lady, but the President role is a tough one.
Did she answer any part of the question? She is so ugh...
At the 0:17 mark you asked a question. At the 0:57 mark you asked it again after constant interruptions. How can you expect an answer if you never stop interrupting?
How do you know if she is lying? Her mouth is moving!
Leading from the knees?
If kamala was a rapist and convicted felon, would she still be in this race?
It seems she still has voices in her ears ... it felt like purposely she was talking slowly, cause she was listening to someone & answering - was there a check to clarify if her earrings are not earphones?
If Trump is to blame for issues during this administration, how will he not do it again during hers? Give me a break Kamala! You’re in over your head!
How does she plan to pay for all this social assistance? She should know that someone will have to pay for this.
This interviewer is asking loaded questions - absolutely ridiculous. Is America not capable of proper debate and conversation?
At the 0:57 mark Brett, you already had asked the question at the start of this video. But you never stopped interrupting Kamala as she tried to answer. How can anyone give you an answer, when you never stop talking? FOX is total BS!
Why won’t she answer a question… it’s so weird.   We should have Kamala Harris day at work and just not answer questions at our jobs 😂
Who weaponized the government and was told to spy on catholic congregations and pro-lifers?  What about parents who opposed offensive sexual content /orientation/pornography being taught to their children in schools?
You think convicted felon trump answers his questions? Haha! He literally stopped questions at a town hall the other day to dance to opera music for 40 mins. That literally happened in Pennsylvania over the weekend. I’ve never seen that happen in my entire life. And trumps “concepts of a plan” isn’t an answer either like when he was asked about childcare and replied with incoherent nonsense. The double standard you’re placing on President Harris vs convicted felon trump is astounding.
Does she have any new lines we haven’t already heard a million times 😅
Why hasnt fox news grilled trump on his ta rri fs and ask him if he understands how t arr ifs even work
What happened to the notion that she cant pull a sentence together because of her low iq? 😂😂  its getting harder and harder to believe fox news rhetoric.
Does she even hear what she's saying? No because she has an ear piece in filling her ear with propaganda.
non american right here. America i love you but how is she vice president !?! legit question 😂 she's dumb as rock
Do y'all listen to her with a prejudiced mind? If so, how can you be honest with your assessment of her?
Isn’t this the same immigration bill that gave over $80 billion to Ukraine and Israel and on $20 billion to “improvements” to the us border security? Why does know one call her out on that?
Supposedly if she knows where the problems are, then why doesn't she fix the problems?
Is she on drugs? Always blaming trump! Blah blah blah! Stupid not even owning their administration mistake!
Is it me or does she say the same thing at EVERY event ?🤣
I just wanna know how this election is even 50/50 how could half the country wanna vote for her? How is that even possible
After watching just 6 minutes of Bret Baier’s interview with former Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), two questions occurred to me: one, why didn’t he mute her mic when she delivered [anti-Trump] speeches instead of answers?, and two, why didn’t he conclude with a yes or no answer to his own unanswered questions as did the talk/opinion show hosts at CNN and ABC whenever they didn’t like Pres. Trump’s answer? Though I believe he could’ve been tougher on exposing her inability/unwillingness to answer his questions, at least he didn’t conduct a softball interview that many feared the FNC management would pressure him to do.
How can you tell if someone is a liar. They keep raising their eyebrows every time they talk.
Weird that he cut the interview so short. Didn't he want to learn more about her policies? Why not let it run for at least 90 minutes rather than barely 27?! o.O
A priority? since when?
What credentials must one have to become the candidate of the dums ?
Who's this guy?...Seems he rehersed 100years for this moment 🎉
Is this an interview about trump or how we are going to fix the clown and pony show? Leaders deal with it and figure out a solution.
What do you mean by not stable clarify and you won't Brett gave you three different opportunities about different things that he could be unstable about and all you can say is he's unstable it's because you don't know what you're talking about you're a liar
What happened to her southern accent?
Don't answer the question, just pivot to attack Trump. What a loser. Those aren't answers. The level of rudeness to a guy that is being polite is gross.
Is she wearing those same earrings again that many thought were hearing mics?  😅 I am not saying they are or are not but my inquiring mind wants to know
If the Governor of Texas had a crises why didn’t he invoke and call upon his Texas National Guard for this crises? Why traffick them to other States? Why have a disregard for the Natural Born Citizens of those States?
So… if she’s going to make such a change, why hasn’t it happened?
How on Gods earth did this woman get to be where she is? She seems to be completely oblivious to the fact that she’s been in power for the last four years.
Better question is this why did Governor Abbott traffick human lives across State lines?
Why do they always leave out the part in the bill “Trump killed” was going to give 100% amnesty?  Edit: Also where’s the policy? The BS talking points and lyrical acrobatics doesn’t lead a country, save my taxes, reduce my taxes, keep insurances affordable and streets safe.
Why did the “border bill” include billions on funding for Ukraine?  I’m glad it failed
What’s her obsession with Donald?
how can i cross ilegally throu mexico can anyone hook me up
Should have asked her about Willie Brown
How many times has she said "Trump"?
Wow you can't answer a simple question can you ??
Who really wants to listen to her for the next 4 years?
The point was the question - “how many people.?”
Did you notice? most of the time when she lies, the bigger the lie, the more she waves her hands.
Like reading a book that is nothing but chapter titles. Where is the content ?
Do you need to ask the right questions if they don't want anybody over, why do they give them debit cards and money
Think you’ll ever see Trump on MSNBC?? Or CNN?? Or even 60 minutes on CBS?? Ask yourself WHY…. Could it be he’s a coward??
She fillibusters so much, how she going to abolish it?
How is this constitutional? She got NOT ONE SINGLE VOTE. How is she even the nominee, how is that constitutional?
Why can they not say anything without bringing Trump into the conversation?  It's all diversion.
Was this an interview about DT or a chance for KH to take accountability and give proper questions. She must really think about DT 24/7.
Why WON'T she Answer the Question,,,,,She just goes on and on and on
Where was she when the american people were dying in north Caroline? But she was there for Israel when they got attacked for their own doing
Did she really think this interview can help her?
I wonder why they don't ask trump questions like this?????
Did you check her earrings?
Does she ever actually answer a question
Hey...so did she say something? Because i tried to follow this blubbering and just couldnt figure out if something was ACUTALLY said
Wish he asked her what is her plan for the economy?
Anybody notice she is wearing the same earrings from her debate with Trump?
When are we gonna learn the person we put in the Whitehouse for 4-8yesrs is not as important as the people we send to congress for 25-30. Term limits now!
Which question did she actually answer ?
How do you know when she is lying ??   ................................she is talking.
Is she using the same ear piece used on her debate with Trump? I guess she needed someone whisper in her ears.
How does Harris not see what they did with the immigration failure?
Easy to identify the problem.  Where are the republican solutions?  As an independent voter where are the solutions?  Brett does a good job pointing out the problems.  Easy work.
How would Kamala Harris fix the immigration problem?  She hasn't done anything about it for the past three years and nine months.
If Kamala cant talk to Bret, and can't talk to Joe Rogan, how on Earth will she be able to talk to Putin???
Did anyone count the number of interruptions from Bret?
Why does every question to her on her policy agenda  switches to a lie about Trump?
Why was the interview so short? Did her handlers shut it down?
Why does he keep asking why half the country supports Trump? How should she know? The whole other half of the country is puzzled.
Harris walked into trap after trap, being completely and utterly destroyed every time, and she wants to lead this country?
Why does she deserve to be the usa president? Has she proved she is qualified?
Was this scripted? She used her same speaking points from her tallow to only talk about Donald trump n how horrible he is and how in her world no one likes him 🙄 give me a break this was a perfect time n place to answer all your critics like actually give more detail into your supposed “plans” we keep hearing about without detail. Or how bout you speak about your self more then your opponent, I get it your opponent is going to be brought up but don’t make all your answers about him n how “bad” he is n lie about what he has said 🙄
WHATHELL ARE WE SEEING??? Retardationationonsenseenowhenoughumansweretardedemocrats🤔🤨😑🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
What the f did I just watch...
Why did you cut the parts that were not convenient for you?
Hey Kamala what about the last 3.5 years?? Can you explain that? Where have you Been up until 2 months ago? Step aside mam We have someone that did an amazing job
If she is willing to talk, why in the hell would you cut her off?!?!?! Someone dropped the ball big time!!!
Why did Kamala agree to get steamrolled by fox news?
As a citizen of another country, I wonder, is this woman the best the Democrats have to offer? seriously?  She can't answer ONE question properly
All these Hollywood actors cant give her lessons on how to act? Lol shes a mess
I have always had an issue with her diction and speech and its only now that i realise she is trying to speak like and Present like Obama..like wow😮😮😮😮...does she have an authentic bone at all??
She keeps talking about all these plans but what are them plans?????🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
Fox News started with misinformation- fox is it a news source? What a joke
Why do women in these positions continue to wear shoulder pads…..
How is she not in prison for treason? All she did was lie, gaslight, and blame Trump for what her administration and what she did.😡🤬
How can I get these 30 minutes back?
Does she not realize that we all just watched her not answer a single question she was asked with a direct clear answer?
When she gets cornered with a legitimate question she blames it on Trump. What a Loser.
When she gets cornered with a legitimate question she blames it on Trump. What a Loser.
Anyone noticed she is wearintg the same bluetooth earings as she did douring the debate? 😮
What did she say? I heard rambling and self doubt
She doesn’t know the question???? Bad
What did the guy do to his face?
What are democrats gonna run on when Trump I no longer running? He lives in her head rent free.
Are we all seeing the same thing here?
Since when is transgender surgery medically necessary?
What kind of vp dont anwser question
Why do you think people trust Trump more than you?  No answer.....
How is it medically necessary to get your peepee chopped off?
Is she high or having a stroke?! My gosh I can't believe she's gotten this far!!
She now has 2 ideas. 25k to new home buyers, and 50k to small businesses.... why is she waiting?
Did she even answer one question...
Hmm the last decade… who were the last four terms? Obama Biden, Obama Biden, Trump pence, Biden Harris…
Why she be lieing
my boss asked me why I hadn't completed any tasks that he gave me these past 4 years.... I blamed it on someone who hasn't been in the job those 4 years then asked for a promotion, pay rise and promised if I was given both then I would complete the jobs...... who am I?
Why don’t they introduce just one item on a bill?  What we aren’t told is WHY it was rejected
He is a terrible journalist.  He asks a question then she gets three words in and he answers it himself.  Continues to interrupt her. Why interview her? Seems to just want to make his own points. This audience just wants to get some gotcha moments. I would have walked out.
Do she think Americans are stupid??😠
Why would she do this😂😂😂
What a masterclass in dodging questions , failing to take responsibility and blaming someone else . Kudos .
And will it be Trump's fault or her own when she loses the election on November 5?
Does she know how many years are in a decade? 😆 🤣
How do you run on a reform platform when you’re literally the incumbent?
Nice earings Scamala! Who's on the other end of that ear piece?
If the country is so tired of the finger pointing....Why does Harris continue to do it?? Hmmm
Can she talk if she sat on her hands and did not wave them around?
How stupid is this lady ! Can’t even answer a simple question, mind blowing with lies and nonsense propaganda.for a political point. Sad day for America. Let’s vote for dumb dunb . To save us , what a joke
Who is going to pay for all of this kamala? Our country is broke!!!!
Why don’t you treat her like the other media outlets treat Trump. Don’t let her talk talk talk
When is it medically necessary to change someone’s gender? Low IQ bs
When is Trump going on CNN? 😅
Could she not even answer honestly the question about Biden's health? Not a hard question really. Too much blaming someone who is not in office, and too many "non answers". But thanks for the interview! And for trying, to get her to answer.
Why the hell did he keep interrupting her? She did a great job. She didn't even bring up Hannibal Lecter.
Dude is this for real!?
I wonder if she was as lousy of a lawyer as she is a vice president
Why won't she answer the question.
Will Trump show the  guts to be questioned like this by any unfriendly channel ? If yes, he has a chance..
Does she really believe what she says?
Sad to watch. Is this America leadership?
Omg she is such an idiot, how did she ever get a law degree?
What about the man your cuty put in prision who is now a millionaire because you locked him up illegally while you kackled?
How does it feel being called out by people who disagree with you Kamala?
What in the botox crisis is going on
What a JOKE this lady is.  She WILL NOT ANSWER any question!!!  Hahah.
How could anyone vote for her?
Why does this cow keep trying to shift the narrative to Donald Trump? She needs to learn how to answer the question and not deflect.
They are the ones trying to lock Trump up?🤷🏻‍♂️
Where was this Kamala hiding during the debate 😅😂😂😂 the reporter had a job to do and he accomplished mission
Why is Brett always interrupting since the get go? It's kinda weird . 😮
Did anyone do a Trump count?
What kind of drug did she take? And anyway, whose speech is slurred? That of Donald Trump or that of Kamala Harris?
Who do you think would be better to build a strong economy? The guy who built a billon dollar business or the Women who slept her to the top ?
How come she can do a Fox interview, but Trump will not do 60 Minuets?
Isn’t this the “hateful rhetoric” the left is tired of????
Why are we letting this happen.
What is Her Greatest Accomplishment since she took office??
How can you look at her more then a minute
When is the funeral?
Who is this interviewer, really the worst I've ever seen. The questions are actually ok but he never lets her finish. Not one single time.
The fkng point is KAMALA!!!!! WE WANT YOU TO ACTUALLY ANSWER THE FKNG QUESTION!!!!!! IS THAT ENUF FOR YOU????;!!!!
Why didn't Bret correct her lies about what Trump meant and has specifically pointed as to whom "the enemy of within" is?? He never once said it was the American People! He named Shifty Shift, bad immigration, corrupt politicians, but never American citizens! I can't believe she was allowed to spew those lies here..
The same earrings!?
How in the world is it a close tie with her and Trump? Who is voting for her? Are they deaf?
Is it just me or she is just like Janet in Friend series at parallel world? 😂
Is it just me or she is just like Janet in Friend series at parallel world? 😂
🎉🎉HONEST QUESTION- after watching this interview did you change or make up your mind? What did it for you? BOTH SIDES- be kind 🎉🎉
What happened to her other accent?
Shall we Just dance right on around the question without yes or no Answers ❓😟
Can someone do a search on how many cases she prosecuted personally, as a first chair?
Does your employer hire felons? Why would you want one for POTUS?
Is anybody considered how angry she got just from simple questions?
The enemy within is you and your machine?
Why did she agree to go to fox?😂😂😂
So madam VP, what are the plans??????
It's amusing to the point of harlious 😂🤣, reading some of the predictably negative comments being expressed about Harris interview.  You MAGA loons and Fox devotees , are such tribalized dullards. You accused Harris, not answering questions and lying about trump- not giving examples of her alleged lying. Simple question for you MAGA loons: since when do care about politicians not answering questions and lying 🤥?   Trump consistently evade interview questions, or he walks out on the interview, or  revert to calling the interviewer nasty names. Trump constantly lies🤥.. example, immigrants are eating dogs and cats in Springfield, government's inaction responding to the most recent hurricane disasters, etc... Before Harris open her mouth, y'all already made your tiny mind up.   Kudos for Harris agreeing to Fox interview. 👍🏼👌🏼👏🏼 She held her own.  Your Messiah Trump is on progressive cognitive decline and has uncontrollable flatus problems. He avoids interviewers that will not enable him, like Hannity and Ingram.   Fact is MAGA loons, your 💯 hypocrites !!
Am I the only one seeing a dodge ball talking????
How about asking what else was attached to the immigration bill?
Who would actually vote for her?
Are people voting for her?
Correct me if I'm wrong,  but isn't it the democrats going after a republican?
When a TV show host asks a question they need to actually listen to the answer. Harris had more to say but Baier kept stepping on her responses. That's the difference between a journalist and a TV show host.
Anyone see the cockroach?
What about your donors,china/Russia? No threat there huh?
Good Lord! Bret is attacking VP Harris about transgender issues??? This is a non-issue.
Anybody trust this phony lying B!TСН???
Did she answer any of these questions?
When did it become a crisis?  When the American people called me on it.  Oh ya an election .
Is it me, or is she already aging faster?
Can she just get to the point and answer a simple question?   It’s not that hard sheesh …
Notice the forehead? Those are "how am I going to answer this?" lines.   I love this guy. He's not going to her not answer the questions.
So Brett asks if 50% of American voters are dump or stupid for supporting Trump?  As I reflect on that question from a safe distance of 9000 or so miles, I am thinking the answer is a definite yes.  America you've been had.
What an idiot. Evades  answering direct questions 😡
He cuts her off all the time. Is that normal?
Are those the same 80 policies that were copied from Biden's website? Is that the page turning she is talking about?🤔
I thought abortion was a state by state decision, why can’t health and education be state by state? Oh Fox you messed that one!
did uall fact check her lies🤔🤔🤮😡
So tired of this cackling women ducking, diving questions. All questions have simple answer she beats around the bush avoiding questions. Do you owe an apology? Feeling awful is not yes!
Why is Hamas still holding American hostages
If she knows how to, why hasn't she ?
Does she not have any other ear rings?
What about the Reddick from the Dems media.
How come she can never SAY her policies ??? We gotta go read an 82 page book now? 😂
Does she not own another pair of earrings...
why is she trying to act like shes conservative now?
does Kamalotoe know she is VICE PRESIDENT? and not Trump? after 4 years in office everything is Trump's fault?
When can I see the Trump interview on CNN?
Why did they change what was working? She is nutz.
What’s the number of immigrants?
Why did she sound like she uttered "assassination" when she said "as a nation"?.😮
Let me be clear, I can tell if she is just that stupid?  Or if she is just that stupid!🤡
Did she EVER CALL THE PARENTS TO THE YOUNG GIRLS ?????
Did any questions get answered?
Am i missing something or did she answer a single thing ??
If she changes her mikd from what she thought 5 years ago, how many more times will she change? Do not trust people changing their mind every other week...
How can the name Donald Trump be mentioned so much in a Kamala Harris interview. She never focuses on telling us what she will do and how in detail. We’re not idiots we also understand politics. Geeze
Does anyone else’s blood boil when she talks….lies?
what a fake corrupt lady, never answering a question and always deflecting the important issues.
Very brave of her to go into the Fox den! Did the fox get the chicken or did she just make it out with all her feathers?
Anyone know how many times she mentioned DJT? I forgot to count. And, as great as Brett was, I'd choke myself if I  had to hear her ignorance again today.
Isn't getting to the point answering the question ?
Why is he interrupting her all the time?
Was she drinking? She is an embarrment to the USA.
What has the Biden Administration done that’s improved your life?
13:11 Interesting... how is she knowing about a recession in the middle of 2025? I haven't read that anywhere. Like 2008 in this case as we are in a very similar position like then with the rates and the way of handling it. If anybody have a link to articles about it that it will actually happen, please link it so my own info is updated in that case.
how many plastic surgeries did the guy have ?
Did they not try to lock him up?
Anybody noticed the same earnings / earphones  she was wearing at the debait??? Hmm 🤔🤔🤔
Would she ever give a straight answer to a question
She’s not very good is she? 😮
“Why does border patrol say you’re too blame and they endorse djt?” “Well looks they work a lot and are stressed.”   …
Why is Brett ignoring the fact that Trump killed the border deal?
Why didn’t Trump pull together a bipartisan deal during his 4 years.
How would she answer a yes or no question?  Just yes, or no Kam?  She's ridiculous.
Where has she been the past 3 years???  She was as silent as a mouse
What an angry stupid woman, she did not answer one question she was asked. Oh my God America if this woman in elected you are done.
Wth was that? She's a joke.
In the last decade.   So 6 years democrats have been in power..... ?
When I run for office:  acknowledge the question, repeat the question as the answer, deflect, blame the opponent, lather, rinse, repeat….
would be nice if she actually answered a question
This woman has to be a joke we’ll all wake up from?!
I mean really?  Does he know Kamala isn't President?  She's pretty much powerless as VP.  Tie Breaker of Senate is the only power she had and designated survivor.  Trying to make her say bad things about Biden, not cool.  That's all this was, attack her on things you know she had no power of.  Snake.
Who tf is this clown
How does Donald get away with such bad behavior and Kamala doesn't? That's all you need to think about.
“Let me speak and finish the question.” “Ok, can you please do it in sentences that has structure and context and without brining up Donald Trump?”
Why has she never talked about her accomplishments as VP,  she keeps bringing up irrelevant experiences and living in the past
Did they edit this interview to make her look better?
Question from a swiss guy: is  israel a state of the USA or why does your country have to defend them?
What about FREE healthcare for AMERICAN CITIZENS and FREE EDUCATION?
Haha is he fact checking her and not letting her finished? That's interesting because when CNN did the same to Trump during the debate Fox News was complaining that Trump was debating 3 people (her and 2 moderators) instead of just her. Now this moderator is doing exactly the same to her what CNN was doing to Trump and I guess now it's OK? Fox News are just bunch of hypocrites 🙄.
No plan on the needs of American people? You mean the same ones of yours? Wheres the specific accountability? GTFOH lady
He asks her question after question and she dodges every single one with Donald Trump this and Donald Trump that. Can't she just answer the question? 79% of Americans feel this country is going in the wrong direction and that points to the last 3 1/2 years, why is that? and she has no answer.
Is womansplaining a thing?
Wow why does he keep interrupting her?
90 Executives order reversed????
Why did you allow her to wear those bluetooth earrings???
what... the full interview 30 mins?
Has she forgotten that Democrats have been in charge for 12 of the last 16 years?!?
Those people were released from detention. What has that got to do with staff numbers on the border?
What a poor  interviewer.  He asked a question and then talked over the answer/response.  It was terrible and very unprofessional.
Anyone else spend the whole time looking at her earrings?  Lol
Is that all she managed to do??!
What are you turning the page from??  What a million dollar question looks like...
She keeps blaming everything on trump yet these past 4 years she’s been vice president ?
6:30 complete lack of self awareness or desperate attempt at gaslighting?
Where is American support for our Americans???
Did they inspect her earrings this time? And are those the only earrings she owns?
I’m tired of the projection, she keeps talking about Trump, what is she going to do as president?
What a idiot , dance around the question , she is a murderer
Why is always DT?? As if Trump is the president now.
She has done nothing in the 3 1/2 years. What will she do in the next 4 years?
Why doesn't this woman answer direct questions...if your not transparent being interviewed how are you out here trying to sell to the ppl BS and expect them to believe or trust you....smh we want thr truth and answers to why you and  Biden failed the taxpayers Americans
How did she EVER become a DA?
Is she couldn't do her job for 4 years because of trump, how will she be able to do it the next 4?
Madam Vice President, what is 2x2? Well, first off let me talk about....
Thank you Fox News for posting the full interview on your channel. Do you really need to make that much money off of your replays that you have programmed in this many ads? The “commercial breaks” are worse than watching your station on cable.
So she only has 1 set of earrings? She is wearing the exact same earrings in every interview. Anyone else notice that?
Be honest guys... Is this a sketch show?
I'm only ten seconds in.  Man, from a body language POV, she should not be sitting in that guarded position, arms crossed over "lady area."  That's not an open honest posture. Does she have zero staff prepping her, does she not listen ot what? That's body language 101.
Why haven’t you done it? You should have done it already, what are you waiting for. You are the ones that waited till now to run on it, hypocrites
Why is she always crying voice.😅
When will DUMP go on MSNBC?
Omg,, who in the planet is going vote for her?
What happened to her Jamaican, southern, Latino, etc accents?
How could somebody yam around this much and not even answer a question
hard wrap why? keep going for 2 more hours
I thought she was a person of colour,  not perfectly clear?
But the ast 4yrs who was is charge? Trump or biden harris?
Why does be LOOK like that? The plastic surgery is cartoonish. He cant even emote.
What happens when you let a 304 in office?
I am sure we have seen those ear rings before?
How can she continue to lie...
Why does the moderator uses the term "illegal aliens"? This normalizes such language. I'm a scared german woman, that knows the history of her country.
Why did they stop the construction of the border wall when they took office?
How did the inflation reduction act turn out?
So she now would do things much differently?
Has she EVER created a job from her company? Mmm 🤔 she has no idea
Does she realize her and job wouldn’t need to fix a problem is they never changed trumps policies? Like can someone please shut her up already? Thank good ness there’s only 20day till we don’t gotta hear her same old rehearsed lines.
Hows it feel getting cut off in every questions?
Has Bret Baier already been fired for this outrageous disaster?
Who has lost their mind.? Biden or Harris, I cannot tell.
Why is she acting like she’s not the 2nd most powerful person in the world?  She can act now America.
How come no one ever mentions that the Border Bill would have sent $80B to fortify other countries’ borders and roughly $20B would go to ours with NONE going for our own wall?  How come she keeps getting away with lying about this?
Was he interviewing or debating or really trying to take her down which his candidate failed to do ?
So the guy who brought together RFK Jr., Tulsi Gabbard, Vivek Ramaswamy, and Elon Musk is the divisive one?
Does he or would he grill trump like this
WHy are they as tough with Orange Julius than with Kamala?
European here, is it normal in America that the interviewer does not let the interviewed answer?
Has she ever called those families? More patrol to let more in? That's what she wants.
Why didn't fox use a proper investigating reporter rather than the soft ball of BB.
Did she answer 1 question?
5:03 before trump got involved? If HE had done better at addressing the border, kamala and Joe wouldnt have had to clean up his mess. We were being coted for human right violations under trumps borders
Did someone take an egg beater to this woman's brain?  She is an absolute mess mentally .
Madam vice president, when did you notice joe Bidens decline in cognitive abilities?   Harris: ORANGE MAN BAD 😡
Did anyone notice that she was wearing the same earrings she had on during the debate?
Is she really wearing those earrings with the head phones again?
So at 13:30 why does she say "our plan as president of the United states" and then goes back to saying "I as president"? I think she messed up and said the the quiet part outloud just like biden has been doing lately.
Does she say anything of substance? She just keeps rambling on and on and not saying anything with any substance. Yell that makes you look even more desperate. Kamala you are a Liar!!!!
Why Camella Harris is CRYING here? WHY>? 🤣 LOSER, LIER!  an example of her crying: 8:35 (* and the entire interview)
How many times did Bret interrupt and talk over her when she started to make a point? Unwatchable.
Which accent is she giving us today…
How about answering the freakin questions and stop blaming Trump.
Why don't journalists call her out on the disgraceful Biden border "security" bill she keeps bringing up? Less that 17% of the $118 billion went to the actual border with the majority of funds going to Ukraine, Isreal, Gaza and other countries.
Has anyone else noticed the same "earrings" in this interview, identical to the ones worn at the Debate?
how many minutes did she waste saying nothing on the first question
Have you noticed how she wears the same earrings to the every interview she does? The ones that look veeery similar to the earrings that are in reality a hidden ear piece? :D
Is this woman insane? Does she have the intellect to understand how much damage she's done to herself?
fresh ideas such as? your experience, your contribution meaning?
what has this to do with trump he not president now they had 3 1/2 years they just made it worse
Just give the number woman. She doesnt know???🤔
For the American people? What has she and her administration done for the American people?
brett: did you notice bidens congnitive decline? harris: i think the people of america have a concern with donald Trump 😂
Did she answer a single question?
Who's trying to lock up who again, Kamala?
Does she ever actually answer a question?
Is she wearing the same Bluetooth earrings again ?
Why are illegal aliens getting lavish benefits while many of our vets are vegetating in the streets..? You should see some of the rent free homes  the regime is putting  them up in in Maine !
So can we move on from “TRUMP STOP THE BORDER BILL” hoax? Since Brett fact checked KH and informed me as well that Sander(I-VT), Booker(D-NJ), Markey(D-MA), Butler(D-CA), Padilla(D-CA) and Sinema(I-AZ) also voted AGAINST the bill?? So it was a bipartisan “NO THANK YOU” for the bill. Fact checked, now stop with lies…
'can i finish?' proceeds to take 6 hours to finish answering one question.... yeah putin, kim and others are gonna enjoy talking to this lady...
Turning the page from the last decade?
The question was… how many? The wanker skamalame was agreeing to what?!?!😂😂😂it was a question😂😂😂
I wonder if the Democrats have given up and thrown her under the bus? It would be poetic.
When is someone going to ask her about Willy?😮
how much plastic surgery this dude has
WHY WHY DIDN'T Brett ask her you taking place of biden without actually running for president, no primary's is actually democracy ? Can you clue us in on anything LOL
She should get the question "How about the freedom of democracy if the mother aborts a growing fetus which has a firmly developed body and its own DNA and why should the mother be allowed to cat in half and suck it out?"
Can you imagine being so braindead that you’d vote for this simpleton?
Kamala, are you on the Diddy tapes?
Why this dude look like a plastic figure of a young version of that old guy from up tho?
Wait what? What did she even say? There isn't a single answer here.
Is this a Greg gutfeld sketch
Does she ever answer a direct question with a direct answer? Instead she just waffles on and on and around any question.
She cannot answer a simple question and frankly she's rude and just terrible why are we even here? Not a single American voted for her
She is full time liar. How is she fitted to even be VP??
Why can't she answer one damned question? What a stupid woman to think we can't see right through her hopscotching blabber. So incompetent and unfit for any political position.
What change do you offer? I’m not Joe Biden, that would be a change.  What a joke
Can she give an answer without the word trump in it haha😂
How many questions did she answer?
HEY, HOW COME THE BORDER WAS STILL BROKEN AFTER TRUMP LEFT?  WASN'T HIS WALL SUPPOSED TO STOP ALL IMMIGRATION?
I thought you guys cover news. Why are you guys posting a comedy skit?
Can we invite her back for another interview? Someone please convince her that this went well
Then why isn't she trying to implement these changes now??  Better to be a successful incumbent than a completely stunned c.......  She reminds me of Justin Trudeau.... she talks incessantly yet says nothing.  Her voice does nothing but cause rage....
Who exactly is she “lifting up”?
How can she be about family? Trump, Vance, Elon, they all have many children. She has no children
Does anyone remember especially the Harris Team, that Trump went to  Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, graduating in May 1968 with a Bachelor of Science in economics. I am pretty sure the planet trusts him considering the ability of understanding economics!!!!
What color do you need to be to get that $25K first time home buyer gift?  That's what I wanna know!
What? What? What do you represent Kamala? Say ONE thing.  You are a bunch of NOTHING
Wow how did they actually manage to find someone worse than Biden?!!!??????????
Please explain what f#$*ing power any vice president has? Civics 101 people. You all seem to forget that part. I blame your education system and your arrogance,
What are you going to do?  Follow the law. Okay, anything else?
How tf can you be vice president and not know that this isn't a Democracy? It's a constitutional republic.
How did SHE sleep her way to the top ????
first question and she´s already frustrated, defensive and not answering it. probably doesn´t even know the numbers or doesn´t understand them. unbelievable. how could anyone vote for her?
Can't stand this woman. He can't answer any question
80 pages, yet you didn’t talk about anything but a first homebuyer loan? Smh
Can ANYONE see this woman negotiating with Putin, or another adversary ?However with the cackling, if long enough,the adversary may CAPITULATE.
Am I the only one that wanted to put my masculine fist through my TV?  I cant take anymore of this gaslighting insanity. THIS IS OUR COUNTRY PEOPLE!!!
And she used to be a lawyer???? Help me ...if she represented me for a parking ticket i would probably get 10 years
Why is this interviewer interrupting every time, it's so annoying to watch an interview like this . Did fox have no one better or that's the idea for them, to not let the other person speak
why then are the immigrants monetarily rewarded and given housing adding to the problem by this administration??????
Wait?  This was scheduled for an hour long interview????
Is this the person that’s bringing JOY back to our country? 🤔 seems pretty angry to me.
Wait, I thought all I had to do as President was talk bad about my opponent… I have to get stuff done?
Do Democrats have someone better to run for office?????????
Can she really stick to the point at all? To the questions being asked? And not beat around the bush.
I just want a real election and a peaceful transfer of power. Is that too much to ask?
Kamala dodged a few questions like a classic politician. Why didn't she just straight up lie like Trump does? That seems to work for him.
21:24 what? 😭🤣🤣🤣
Why can't KAMALA answer the question???
So with a mentally incompetent president, the blame for what happened goes to the opponent, not the VP?
Is her campaign about discrediting Trump or is it about helping America?
What are her plans?
When questioned about her own policies VP Harris looked like a rabbit in the headlights and tried to blame a person (aka former Pres. Trump) who was not in control of any Federal action and continued to lie about the facts. At last she was asked relevant questions and follow up questions and failed miserably.
I lasted 46 seconds. You?
Didn't DEMOcRATS _KNOW_ this is what they were putting UP ?
Why didn't they EXPECT this from THEIR "Candidate"  ??
What has happened to Gox News? Questions asked went unanswered followed by a feeble attempt to repose the question. Kamala managed the interview.
No matter how you feel about Gaza, does anyone else notice how unfeeling her eyes are when it comes to addressing the deaths of minors? Just something I caught
Did anybody count how many times she said Donald Trump?
Who was the moderator .. Kammy or Bret?
I’m all the way in Australia so I don’t have a horse in the race so this is a purely unbiased and genuine question… does she just parrot whatever she’s told through an ear piece? Just wondering because she takes pauses at the start of her sentences like she’s getting told what to say 🧐
How can one still vote for her after this?
If she thinks Iran is the biggest threat to the U.S  why did the Harris/Biden Administration just threaten/beg and do everything in their power to force Israel to back off on their retaliatory strike against Iran???
Has anyone noticed she's wearing those " wireless earings" very similar to those she wore on debate????
Bret Baier: "Madam Vice President, what is your favorite color?" Cackles McKneepads: "Donald Trump."
17:19 😂😂😂 what ?????
She’s wearing the same earrings that she was wearing at the debate. Coincidence?.
Brett should have followed up on the questions, she evaded For example when she did realise that joe biddn mental state became bad?
Your so-called plans are great, now where are you getting the money to pay for them? FEMA and Social Security are both under funded and don't have funds to bring your so-called plans to reality.
Does anybody know in what social class she grew up? She didn’t mention that, bummer!
“Why didn’t you teach these people well?” I’m the only candidate that has been a teacher, so I know best (a position you held doesn’t make up for incompetence)
Who had sent Jan 6 to jail?
Now imagine Kamala talking to Putin or Xi like that: can I finish my point? And she takes 10 mins to not answer a single question.
ChatGPT : Deciding who is the “lesser evil” between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, or whom to vote for, depends on your personal values, political priorities, and how you evaluate their policies, leadership styles, and track records. Here are some key factors to consider for each:  Kamala Harris  	•	Strengths: 	•	Progressive Policies: Harris supports expanding healthcare access, criminal justice reform, climate action, and protecting civil rights for minorities, women, and the LGBTQ+ community. 	•	Diplomatic Leadership: As Vice President, Harris focuses on diplomacy and alliances, working with global leaders on immigration, climate change, and human rights. 	•	Criticisms: 	•	Prosecutorial Record: Some argue that her time as California’s Attorney General was marked by decisions that led to the continued incarceration of non-violent offenders, which critics see as inconsistent with her progressive stance. 	•	Perceived Ineffectiveness: Some view her performance as vice president as lacking concrete achievements, especially in areas like border management.  Donald Trump  	•	Strengths: 	•	Economic Focus: Trump’s policies emphasized tax cuts, deregulation, and reducing foreign economic dependencies, which some argue boosted the economy pre-pandemic. 	•	Nationalism and Populism: His “America First” platform resonated with voters who felt left behind by globalization and elite politics, prioritizing national interests and stricter immigration controls. 	•	Criticisms: 	•	Divisiveness: Trump’s rhetoric is often cited as polarizing, contributing to heightened political tension and societal divides. 	•	Controversies: His involvement in the January 6 Capitol riot and refusal to accept the results of the 2020 election have drawn widespread criticism about his commitment to democratic norms.  Who to Vote For  To decide who to vote for, it helps to ask yourself a few key questions:  	1.	What policies matter most to you? – Do you prioritize social justice, healthcare, and climate action (Harris), or are you more focused on economic growth, nationalism, and immigration control (Trump)? 	2.	Leadership style – Do you prefer a more diplomatic and inclusive approach (Harris), or are you drawn to a bold, confrontational leadership style that challenges the status quo (Trump)? 	3.	Experience and integrity – How do you weigh their personal ethics, controversies, or their ability to lead the country in a direction that aligns with your values?  Ultimately, voting is a personal choice, and determining the “lesser evil” is subjective. Each candidate has strong supporters and detractors, so it’s important to vote for the person whose vision for the future aligns with your own.
How did Brett not burst out laughing when she started to get angry. I would not have that type of self control.
How many of you are watching this without bias or preconceptions already deciding how you're going to judge this?
Why was this interview given such little time. We could easily have used at least another half hour.
Cut off junks of trans girls in girls prison? Hmm
80 pages of her policy on her website is crazy work...Really 80?
Did I hear a smoke alarm around 18:30 😂
Who's turning the military on the American people?   Revised 5240.01 Effective September 27, 2024 Page 13 Secretary of Defense Approval 2(C) authorizing troops to be used against civilians and to use lethal force on civilians where 'confrontation... is reasonably anticipated'
2:00 the democrats held a mojorty in the House and the Senate? She did nothing about it
So can’t handle a reporter without losing her cool.. how will she handle our adversaries?
Why ask questions if you dont want the answers.
So is there anyone who worships maga capable of debating Harris without getting slayed?  Meanwhile trump the coward is phoning in his lying rants to his safe space from his golden bog….😂😂😂
SWAAALLLLOOWWW? We have done nothing whatsoever Bahasa
After 10 min listening to this women?🤯🤯🤯She is sooooooo incompetent
If you know what to do, why the hell you didn’t do it???
Is she gonna list of 75 bills without answering the question
What's the point of asking questions if you are not going to let her say a word!??
Why did he start out interrupting her right off the top? How rude!
We, the American people, DESERVE an answer, when did you first notice that President Biden's mental faculties appeared diminished?
Did trump's campaign run out of money or is Fox afraid he'll shaft them on the bill (like he does the cities he holds rallies in) that they have to run his ads for free in an interview?! Unprofessional, unethical...typical Fox.
Does anyone else have a hunch that, after this interview, the polls will start to show substantial differences?
What are you going to to do no lets hear it
How does the v.p. pretend to answer questions with a straight face?  Who bought her soul?
Can no one see the smurk when she lies????????????????????????
He killed the border bill? Ok why wait till the 11th hour to propose one?
When she can’t answer a question she likes to play the blame game instead of answering the question
I wonder how people would respond if she was a white man and had just performed like that
WHY DOES PENCE NOT SUPPORT TRUMP ANYMORE??
Notice the same earrings ??! Has she ever raised the rumor that it’s an earpiece ????
They’ve both been in office. Who was better?
Can't answer a question.. pathetic
is there a word for what starts happening at 24:00 lol
Joy versus Drill, Really USA ?
What kind of dressing do you want with that salad ma'am ?
What the hell happen to trump face .he turn black.
what part of dumfuk is hard for u to understand?
Why did Bret feel compelled to interrupt an intelligent woman?   Why couldn't he let her finish her sentences?  Harris was a hell of a lot more cogent than he was.
What she's going to do is a secret... that she doesn't even know
Its horrifyingly frustrating, listening to her every answer almost every question with, "Trump did this or said that". "What color is the sky?"   "Well Trump is dividing the people"...... NOOOOO ANSWER THE QUESTION PLEASE JUST SAY SOMETHING THAT ISN'T TERMINAL TDS PLEASE !
Did anyone understand anything she said?
Hey @YT, why can't I respond to Leftist comments? My comment posted. But, when I click on others to respond, nothing happens.
Is this the real life.....or is this just fantasy... caught in the lime light.... 😅😅😅
How low IQ must you be so that you actually want to vote for her?
what was the question /?
Is that the full interview?
she smoking crack?
I see a lot of videos of people asking "Why vote for Kamala? What is she going to bring to the table?" And they usually cant answer... well now i know why... she cant even answer that question herself
does not look like the dems want to win this election, maybe they know something we don't?
Why do these lying commie wanna be’s NEVER get fact checked?! Vote Trump! It’s the obvious choice between the 2!
Guadalajara cartel? Which one is that?? 😮😮😮
What about all the women who lost their lives due to Donald Trump's abortion bans?
How can people vote for her?!
How many lies can she pack into one short interview?
Is she serious?
Can she do anything other than deflecting to trump?
Where was the joy? 🤡
Does she bring up “I was raised in a middle class family”? If she did I’m not watching..
Why did they undo TRUMPs executive orders were in place why did they undo them, the first day.
13:56 Is this a Trump interview or is it about Kamala?   She blames Trump for her administration?   Pathetic children.
They did tell her that Trump isn’t president currently correct? I’m just curious cause she’s acting like he’s the current president. That’s what’s confusing.
Can't answer a question directly
why is she talking that way?
She's avoiding the questions. Who are the bigger idiots supporting this idiot?  Really good interview. Asking all the right questions and exposing her idiocy.
I could of sworn that's Maya Rudolph...is this SNL?!?!
8:48 does anyone believe that she gets it?   She doesnt get anything that wasnt given to her from her masters.
Why can’t Kamala just answer a question ?
Why does this woman still have any realistic chance of becoming president?
How dare you ask me questions I don't want to answer.
Why they are Supporting Donald Trump then?
Those must be her lucky earrings? Shes also wearing them?
quoting mark milley? really?
When will Trump go on MSNBC?
Why does she keep referring to herself as we if she were to become president
Has ANYONE noticed that Kamala with all her money wears those same earrings every time she’s in the public, making a speech or on any talk show? Keep your eyes on her earrings every time you see her. Gods Blessings.
What jacked up timeline am I in now?
Does anyone actually believe in her? I’m confused how she has a singular vote coming her way.. 🙄
lol why is the media attacking kamala and defending trump? something wrong is not right
How can people vote for this woman
how can anyone with brain vote for this 304?
Just a humble question: Where is D. Trumps medical record, how come he said he wanted to be dictator for a day, change the constitution, what is his "concept of a plan", why does he refuse to take another debate as he was mocking Biden for, why does he oppose IVF and abortion... and have people complaining about inflation noticed that it's not a - certainly very annoying - fact in the US, but A GLOBAL POST-COVID PANDEMIC GLOBAL PROBLEM?
Why did they play the wrong clip about the “Enemy from within?” 🤔
Question? Kamala answers Donald Trump. Please no further ,she cannot become president.
How can he ignore that those young women would be possibly still alive if trump hadn’t given the order to deliberately vote against a bill that would have brought massive change to border control because he wanted to keep it a problem so he could use it as an issue for his electoral campaign.
Will she ever answer a question? She was asked “will you support gender affirming surgery for inmates??” Her answer: “I will follow the law…” shm!! Unbelievable how noone can get her to answer anything on point🤦🏻‍♀️
Oh weird… 🤔 she is wearing the same earrings??? 🧐 I wonder why.
Is she still wearing those ear rings 😂
Does she know how to answer questions? This is so painful, watching every answer just reflecting to trump, they’ve been running it to the ground for years and she forgets this?? She hasn’t done no good so far … why would it change now?????
Youtube is already threating me with CENSORSHIP.....Who's the fascists YouTube  ?......Maybe be on the side of AMERICA for once !
She still has the earpiece that looks like an earring eh?
Does she ever answer questions or does she just talk in circles?
Why did she even do this interview?
@18:23 Did I really hear a fire alarm beep?! lol
Brett, why didn't you hit Kamala on why the Border bill was not passed IE the foreign aid that what is hidden in the bill that would have sent way more money overseas than money to help the Border?
Does she know this interview is about her not trump???
Why has Fox flipped? Change of batter coming
You will follow the law?! Yet, you’re lawless & also trying to rig our Constitutional Rights…hmmmm 🤔🧐🤨
Is it just me, or did anyone else keep yelling at the TV "SHUT HER UP!"? Do I have to watch it twice to hear if she spoke of anything else but "Donald Trump". He is PRESIDENT TRUMP. Put a sock on her, please🤷🏻‍♀️
Huh, you recognize the problem  since day one in the office and what did you fixed? 🤬🤬🤬 you made everything worse !MTF !
Does she ever get to the point? Pure madness how much she can talk and say nothing.
Does she only own one pair of earrings?
But Kamala, how did the job get open for you?? Nobody elected you in the primary. Be so for real
You and i both know what I am talking about? Lol I actually don't know what you are talking about. 😂😂😂😂😂😂.
Did she Freudian slip that Biden is the experiment?
Did she cut and paste her 80 pages of policy from Wikipedia?
How do you chart a new way forward when you been in office 3.5 years
Is she talking in slow motion?
Why not answer one fkin question without referencing your opponent. So annoying
Brett, why did you let her continue to go on and on about Trump?
Blow up our deficit? Hasn't her asministration done this
Are you going to share your experiences with judge Brown? That would be interesting
Where is accountability in here?
What does "following the law" mean on prisoner gender change ?
Is this how she will talk with world leaders?
She’s a horrible liar, it’s simple  just answer the question. Why did your administration change most if not all of the already proven and working  well policies of Trump? Word salad yup that’s what we a new was going to happen.
If she (and the “experts”) lied about Biden’s mental competence… why should we trust her (and them) now?
Why the hell is our tax dollars paying for transgender surgeries for prisoners…. WHAT???? when there are children in this country that are not get the health care that they need???? WTH is going on?
Why did she change a lot of her positions ?? and why is no answer relevant while claiming it to be true when everybody can see the lies spoken 😮😮😮😮😮 LORD please help us, save us from this evil
If ppl are tired of trump then why does she keep talking about him?
Oh my God, this woman is a sad human being! America has fallen so low? Are you going to let this woman lead the USA?
Why is Brett not fact checking this person?
Wonder if the same people who complained that Martha Raddatz interrupted JD Vance many times in the ABC interview come back here and complain about Bret Baier interrupting Harris all the time?
Wasn't she just dancing and chanting with a group of people screaming absolutely no deportations? The deportation bill she keeps refferingbto was a rubber stamp to give MILLIONS automatic citizenship. Those democrats and republicans that voted it down are the ones that should be applauded.
If, according to her Biden is fine and fully functional Why is he not on the Ballot?!?
Is it r3tarded?
Why a person/ party  party before a country???? I didn't get it.
Are we watching Elaine from Seinfeld in real time. A show she is putting on about nothing
How is she this bad??? 😂😅😂
What ear rings does she have on
If she yells, does that make it true?
Can she take any responsibility for her actions over the last 4 years?
Don't get why they allow trump ramble of topic to the point the original question is forgotten, and Kamala not allowed to finish answering a question.
is she the first vice president we ever expected to be in control of anything?
So why you did not fix the broken immigration system?
Can she answer a simple question instead of deflecting to Trump everytime.
She sounds like someone who didn't graduate from high school - too many drugs?
The question is indeed, why is half the country supporting Donny?
How is it even possible that she is running for PRESIDENT? 😅
What has she done is she crazy
More judges to do what expedite citizenship? In exchange for socialist programs ?
The enemy within? He has been shoot at twice by Americas in America. How much more of an enemy within can you get?
So she can tell when Trump is unstable and not well but she couldn’t tell that Biden was unstable and not well?
How can she blame Trump for the last 3.5 years .She was in office not him. All she wants to do is blame Trump for everthing.
What is she talking about she’s saying nothing.
I wonder why she's always talking in third person
If Trump is responsible for everything while she holds the power of office.. what do we need her for..?
Did you noticed that she has not mentioned Project 2025 once💁🏻‍♂️
Strengthening small business? By adding all these new bureaucratic items inundated to go against the success of a small business which only big business can afford to hirer those people needed to do those items to be in compliance to these new laws?
She’s going to give $25,000 for housing where will she get this money?
Anyone notice she is still wearing the same earrings in every interview that she wore in the debate? Still getting controlled from behind the curtains.
Well that wasn't an interview. Was it. Was it?
Why are they talking over each other?
What kind of dressing is going on that word salad?
She doesn't say she regrets the open borders and if it's a priority since day 1 then why has it been 4y?
Have they produced any evidence proving Trump killed the immigration bill?
How is it possible that 50% of the population still supports this cringe woman?
Why anyone give this lady air time?
If those are Tiffany pearl earrings and not Bluetooth - WHY???? CONTINUE WEARING AND CONTINUE THE CONTROVERSY
Same earrings as the debate that seem suspiciously similar to the Bluetooth ones for someone worth over 7 million according to google you don't change your earrings?
Anyone need to learn how to completely dodge questions with vague/evasive/nonsense responses?  Kamala Harris is the queen of dodging questions!
Why are you giving those immigrants funding tho???
How do the viewers of Fox not see through their bs?
Waiter: "What would you like to have for drinks?" Me: I was raised by a middle class family.
Did he even offer to drink a beer with her?  Pretty unprofessional.
Is she stupid? What’s these answers have to do with the question! She is a tragic, this is why she’ll never become a president! She belongs at McDonalds, where she said she worked. She’s a train wreck! 😊
Jesus Christ, can she not answer a single fcking question?
What a moron. She hasn't the capability to answer a question. Saleperson/attorney type responses to all questions.And ALWAYS blaming the previous administration.
Jesus christ how is she running for president? Why vote her? She dodges every question.
Does she know she is crazy?
Can she even go a sentence without mentioning Donald Trump and answer the question?
Can Trump sit on NBC like this?
Who TF is voting for that…
When will Trump be on MSNBC? 😂
How can we elect a person to be POTUS who keeps running away from answering straight questions???
Do democrats not hear what she is saying or frankly what she is not saying. The word salads are unbearable to listen to.
How can you trust a person that betrayed America
Who is ACTUALLY locking up people for actively disagreeing? Not Trump.
Why doesn’t he or anyone else ever bring up the fact that every effort Texas made to secure the border, the federal government countered their efforts to secure the border?
She's got those earrings on again!! Whose she listening to??? She talks in circles
Harris has accepted 17 million dollars from anti fracking groups. Why? If she isn't against fracking....now.
This country is nearly 250 years old and ain’t got its border laws / immigration laws figured out yet?
Why did the Biden-Harris administration issue Executive Order to stop wall building which quadrupled illegal immigrants, and blamed that they inherited the problem from the Trump administration??
What a joke, she cannot even answer a simple question about what she would do differently. Always goes back to Trump but he hasn’t been in office and she has!
Still trumps fault? He hasn’t been president Igor last 4yrs! This country is in far worse shape since Trumps been out!
When he asks the first  question and interrupts her after 10 seconds  you know he was defeated.  After 20 seconds Baer did nothing but interrupt her, never defended Trump and got his azz handed to him, game, set, match, Harris.
Kamala, what about the single black mother that you had arrested and put in jail because her daughter who has sickle cell anemia and had missed school? You can't answer that! You have American blood on your hands!
And what have most every person that worked for her had to say about her!!???
What kind of debate is this where he won't shut the hell up and let her talk? If Trump was sitting there he would not even open his mouth.... 🙄
ask a question, let the person you asked answer?  nope not on Fox News.  Unless you are called Trump, then you can ramble on and on and the interviewer does nothing.
Is this the whole interview?
Does mr Brett understand the role and power of vice presidency? He can look at mr mike pence 😂
Will he allows Vice President Harris to answer his questions or continues to interrupt her?????
Why she act like a baby momma and ain't got no babies😂
Do you owe those families an apology? *Shakes head no*
Locking people up because they disagree......hmmm isnt that what you are doing??  Your pathetic
13:23 - is this the Royal "We" or we as the "Cabal"?
Wonder if the same people who complained that Martha Raddatz interrupted JD Vance many times in the ABC interview come back here and complain about Bret Baier interrupting Harris all the time? 😆
Million $ Question of the show!!! Brett: You have been VP for 3.5 years, so what are you turning the page from?
Why O Why can’t SCAMALA just answer a question without it taking 10 minutes?  WHY????
How is she this bad in an interview?
Wow, her website went from displaying zero policies to suddenly displaying 80 pages of policies? They are getting desperate.
Who is being grilled ? Kamala ???
Grilled ? Oh please …. She grilled frumpy
who's biden?
Not one question answered?
Kamala… did you have a brain fart during the entire 20 minutes of this interview? Oh wait… you have no brains!
"Uhhhh..... is this question a yes or no answer,  or is it an essay question?...."
How many times did she say Donald Trump??
how many died at the border when trump was president?
Higher taxes for the rich?  How does that help the middle class?  They dont get anything from that.
was this an interview or a debate? It seems like Brett has much more speaking time.
Can you go 30 seconds without mentioning Trump??
How many of you took A "SHOT" every time she said "TRUMP?
Question: Are you going to defend Taiwan if China CCP invade Taiwan?  A: Let me be clear. I grow up in a middle class family
Can we please get a body language expert to help explain her?
“Why does she keep talking about Trump the whole time? Can she talk about her own policies instead? We’re even more confused.
6 democrats voted against that bill out of how many?
How about giving the taxpayer a break  we are now paying for people who never paid a dime into our system
Does anyone know how many times she said Donald Trump’s name?
I wonder if Brett could smell the wine when she started yelling
Why are all democrats so obsessed with Trump? This is insane.
Why did you and Joe Biden give billions to Iran while you left our homeless veterans lving in the streets
How much of lies can have this demoncrat on her mouth? She never finish to spite lies
Any shame of yourself?
Is she even aware that giving tax cuts to the rich creates jobs? The reason billionaires are billionaires is cus they make money, and to do that they need to  create work. They can't create more jobs at the moment in the states because it's too expensive for them. Giving them tax cuts is a win win for everybody.
Does he ask her about her many voices
Does she talk about anything other than Trump?
Giving 25k to help with downpayments will only drive up  housing prices.   How about dropping mortgage rates?  At 7%  you are paying over $1000  more a month on a 300k house in interest alone vs a 3%  thats 12k a year, or $360,000 MORE over a 30yr mortgage.
Was trump grilled by fox news ever?
Why are Trump voters obsessed with people’s genitalia?
If trump is stopping your current administration for doing anything, are you going to get anything done in the next?
Why do so many people support wacky donnie?  It's not like Faux news has spent every hour of everyday lying to people and convincing them he's a god-like figure. What can it possibly be...
Why can’t she answer questions??!! Omg
Where's her accent? LOL
Is keeping Trump out, the main reason we should vote for her?!? She represents nothing substantive it seems.
Have you noticed that Kamala wears the same earrings for every interview…mmm 👀
Did anyone count the number of times she mention Trump?
Dish she say "experiment" referring to biden ..then swayed to trump..how is she so confused?
On Monday, there's a game between the Chiefs and the 49ers. Does anybody know what time it starts?
I’d really like to know who came up with the idea of setting a time limit and cutting her off instead of letting her speak freely. Why hasn’t that person been fired yet?
Isn’t she the one who had people arrested for praying outside abortion clinics, arrested for attending the J6 event? Yet she says Trump will use the military against the people…okay
Wow! Who’s better at dodging questions than her!! Man!!! Dems couldn’t do better than this!!?
Will Trump now agree to an interview by MSNBC?
How can there not be one single comment I can find that supports her, and apparently 47% of the country supports her?!?
What kind of professional journalist asks a question and then speak over the person so they can’t respond.
Wait, why was she in the situation room without Joe Biden? Was this a standing order from the president is unavailable to have the vice president step in? Why was Joe Biden unavailable?
The dems have literally locked people up for freedom of speech. Does anyone remember Clinton locking that guy up for a meme? 😂🤡
Can anyone name one piece of legislation Trump passed? Even one?
How many illegal immigrants have you RELEASED into the country? What kind of question is that? Oh Bret… 😂
So sad that she can't answer the question but deflects the conversation Trump.  "Trump is unstable but Joe Biden is on his game"?
How....can someone vote....for her...?
17:57 you bandwagoned with all the people trump fired to bad mouth him instead of laying out policy?
Please God can someone Fact Check if Harris actually did prosecute drug runners? I heard that in 10 years she only had 1 case per year which is super non productive don't ya think?
Hmm those ear rings again?
Can this woman not answer a single question?  Shame on the USA who allows a shameful individual to be on the ballet
4 years and she couldn’t turn the page??? Are the papers stuck together with glue or you Kamala?
Unstable? Lady, look in the mirror.
Can she unburden us of herself already
How many times did he interrupt and talk over? Must have been 16 or 17 times.
Does she ever get tired of lying??
how about the one's silenced still under threat
She had a typical politician "word salad" response to a lot of these questions. Not as bad as Trump, of course, but still not very informative. Can we start demanding politicians answer questions to the same standard of like, a high schooler giving a class presentation at least? I don't think I've seen the candidates give more than five or six comprehensible answers about policy in the last few years.
Can she answer the question for gods sake
How many times did she say Donald Trump?
What's the point of having an interview that the interviewer doesn't even let the interviewee talk and keeps interrupting her?
Why does she keep saying the word burden throughout this campaign? Like it's comical at this point
But did she grow up middle-class?
Is her ear piece working. 😅
Bret really doesn’t know what she’s talking about.  Why? why?
What the fk was that
Has anyone ever wondered how many cases are the "asylum judges" handling and ruling on every year? How many are denied? Should be 90% because that is a common number. So lets say 100,000 cases per year (would be low count), why aren't we seeing or hearing about 80-100,000 people deported every year? Is anyone getting deported at all? We never hear about these numbers and cases being processed.
Has anyone criticizing Kamala actually heard Trump speak? The guy never says anything intelligent.
Doesn't she understand she can't blame trump for the past 4 years? She can't win on this platform. You can't win the presidency blaming someone else for everything you have your hands in and not have any type of plan.
13:21 Why does she say we when referring to herself???
How the hell is she even in the position to run for presidency? So incompetent. I dont even know if she is competent enough to be a fortune 500 middle manager
She hasn't answered one question?
Vice Presidents have almost no power to create any policy.  If that was true tell me what Pence did for us as Vice President?  I’m waiting….
Harris was in hiding for 3 years were was she these last 3 years?  She was MIA.  SHE IS WAY UNDER EXPERIENCED AND SHE IS A NARCISSISTS A LIAR AND SHE STANDS FOR NOTHING.  SHE IS A DANGER TO ALL OF US.
What the heck are you talking about!!!!!!!!--
How many times does she say “TRUMP” ??
Does she have her microphone earrings on again?
Is she allergic to answering the actual question?
I wonder if Kamala is voting for Trump, she can't stop talking about him.
What’s with the fake accent at 8:40?
Funny how come Ukraine don’t need congress but Americans can’t get help without them ???
13:20 who are we?
How does giving a $25,000 grant to people buying a house bring housing costs down? That's going to drive housing costs up...
Can you let her speak? He was acting like a child.
I just wonder if she is ever reading the comments put against her. And if so, why does she think that she is the best?🤔 Oh! G-d please help Americans.🙏💥
A new generation?  Shes almost AARP age.   That's not what us Gen Z connect with.
😂 Is this a joke? Leader material??? OH GOD help us
What WE would do as president?  Who is "We"?
What are these so called plans?
Seriously she is loopy !?!?!
Does she not realize that she was in office during this whole time?
Does she not realize the major division started under Obama? The worst I've ever seen politics be started under her own parties rule.
Why is it so hard to answer a question honestly because you’re a devil and you’re evil
Why don’t they vet these people why?
This broad.   Are we being trolled here?  Really though,  I’m most excited about not having to SEE and HEAR this broad anymore
Why would anyone vote for her??
Why would she agree to this interview? 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
Aren’t those the “special” earrings? Those that act as in-ear monitors….
What a prick… Brent seemingly asking, loaded questions and not giving her the opportunity to answer them and continued to step on her sentences before he went on to the next loaded question obviously in chump’s back pocket trying to make her look like she is in adequate what a prick
Is she wearing the same earrings she wore during the debate
10:30 why didnt she use any of that experience prosecuting cartels durin her run as VP ? 😆
She won't answer anything! How can that be our leader?
What business have you ran? Or been apart of?  Where are you getting the money for these houses?
have the smart Democrats left the party?
So now poor black people can use the internet to go see her policies she will never say in an interview but its wrong for us to have voter ID? how sway? make it make sense please
How can someone talk so much and say nothing except Orange Man Bad?
Why would she do this interview? Lmao 😂😂😂
Why not answer the questions...
If they are worried about the military turning on the people why authorize the dod to use lethal force on citizens?
Anyone think she's stupid enough to interview with Joe Rogan, Tucker,  or Glenn Beck also?
Fox should be ashamed of themselves. When their maga cult storms their offices I wonder what lies they’ll spin then? You know when Trump loses and the US military turns on him and MAGA finds out reality they’re gonna turn on Trump too.
Does this interviewer love listening to his own voice or what. Let your subject answer your questions, this is amateur hour.
Why does she need Asylum Judges when the border could be tightened and not have allowed the illegal migrants to our country? Why not give more power to the border patrols to Eliminate anyone Illegally entering the border?
Who are these republicans on stage with her ??
Can this chicken ever answer a question ,brain still under a desk
Did NOT answer ONE single question!
So sick of her lies…. Can she be arrested for her stupidity?
Are all republicans stupid or just small minded
Still hasn't answered the first question, 4 minutes in. Blah blah blah. No answer for how many have come in under your watch? No answer for do you regret killing "remain in Mexico.  Neither question answered at all.
so now poor black people can use the internet to go see her policies she will never say in an interview but its wrong for us to have voter ID? how sway?
What she turning the page on? She's been in charge in the past 4 years??? What page is she planning on turning??? She is a loser...and sounds like a liar and a loser...she is the "what has been"
What is your plan Kamala!?!? You’ve never mentioned the actual plan!!!
She wears the same earrings for every interview, is that the only pair she owns????  Hmmmmmm
Where are all the missing children????
I’m confused…. Was Trump president the last 4 years or was Biden?!?   I think she might be confused about who has been in office.    She is a joke!
How many people she let in?
I wonder if she's aware of her own lies. Even if she's not, the American people are.
Is this a real interview or  SNL skit ???
Is she black today or Jamaican today or Hindu today...
Did Harris ever answer any of Brett's questions?
Ask yourself- Would you hire her?
Why was the question asked, “why are you so angry right now.”
Isn't she better of arguing her point of view rather than focusing on Trump?
Did she answer any questions 😮
She's wearing those ear rings again ? With the microphone .
WHY for the live of God does she Always turn everything back on Trump? Everything? Why? She has NO policy whatsoever?
How delusional do you have to be to blame someone else for everything you’ve done
Why is there a comment section on this interview and no comment section for MSNBC commentators. Vote Trump
Can this pathetic woman answer a straight question without drawing comparisons to Trump? The point of a question is an answer. She doesn't get that and she didn't get it during her vice presidency
Can she answer a question without saying Donald trump?
But, how much was going to Ukraine??
Any idea who is forcing him to wrap up and why?
Is Brett always rude or only with women?
Why does she always wear those big earrings when being interviewed?
Where is Trump hiding at his rallies with all the MAGA supporters? 😂😂😂😂 She is here facing the evil.
Democrats, aren't you upset even a little with Harris as your nominee?  After all, you weren't given a chance to vote for a nominee.
When they ask Trump/Vance about what their administration would do, they talk about policy. When they ask the other guys the same questions, they talk about Trump and tell you to look at a website list.
Can she answer ONE QUESTION without bringing up Trump??🤦🏽‍♂️…. That tells me all I need to know
Is the mentally unstable threat to democracy in this room with us?
Can she give just one straight answer to a question He was basically asking her yes or no questions she never gave an answer Will not straight answer anyways
Kamala what time is it?                                  “Trump”
Is anyone else screaming at the scream?
which ear yall think her MIC is in?????????
Did she regret cancelling 'remain in Mexico?'...never answered the question
Isn't there any woman qualified to be president?
Why did she undo successful border policies?  She’s full of it.
when is she going to actually answere just one question
How’s it feel to be asked real questions?
Why does fox torture themselves and be humiliated? 😮...
Geez... Will she ever give a straight answer?
Redirected all prodding about Biden’s decline to Trump. What’s she redirecting for if there’s nothing to hide about his mental clarity? 🤔
Why are they hiding the negative comments?  Google owns YouTube?  I hope Trump splits them up like MaBell phones of the past like the monopoly on our minds that it is!  Go Trump!  Make America Great with us and for us all even the misguided folks that think this failure and cheater who fraudulently won her first political position is the answer!
Does she even qualify to be a presidential candidate? 😂
What’s wrong with his face?  I couldn’t concentrate on anything he said with that plastic botoxed face.
Why would she do this 😂
My god? Answer a flipping question.  She told them to come. Own it. Take responsibility. She is a politician and not a VP or President.
Why is Trump Putin's bestie, and why did he sent him personal deliveries of rare materials in 2020?
Why can’t she admit Biden was turning into a potato?
Did she ever actually answer any one of his questions?
Why did she not fire Biden as VP she had a duty to call him out ...
Have any of y'all looked into the info she talked about? Suckers and losers, huh?!?
Madam vice president, which do you consider to be your greatest strength, your own policies or the fact that or aren’t Donald trump?
Hummm, so will the new administration keep cocaine out of the Whitehouse?
Why doesn't she ever get specific about her “plans,” for the economy????
is it just me or does she wear the same earrings every public appearance now?
What makes kamalie think homeowners want the value of their homes to go down??
6:30 what's her OF?
Is she wearing those same blue tooth earnings lol ! You go girl 🤡
How many times did she say his name 😂
LOVE KAMALA!!! Why does fox ask a question then talk over the person when she tries to answer?   GFC you invited, let her answer!!!!! 💙🌊💙🌊💙🌊💙🌊🌊💙🌊
is she wearing her two way earings???
How do you avoid answering a question or taking accountability for your actions without saying you're avoiding or denying?
Why does she wear the same earrings in almost every interview? Does she not have another pair?
Anybody know how to prove your not the enemy within, is there going to be a loyalty test perhaps? Maybe everyone will get a MAGA tattoo on our hands just so we know who the bad people are?
Now that Kamala Harris has come to Fox when will Trump appear on MSNBC? or is he too scared.
20:16 whats rhe democracy in getting elected and not voted in????
Did anyone do a word count on how many times she said “Donald Trump?” 😮
how difficult could it possibly be to prosecute gangsters?
What is she talking about...??? Seriously what is she talking....
Are they actually yours..?
Is there a person on this earth that is a worse presidential candidate than Kamala Harris? Seriously I can’t think of a worse one
You mean the border bill that would have sent money overseas for a war that is not our own?
Was that an interview? She simply can't give a straight answer. The queen of dragging out absolutely nothing.
How many times did this loser say Trumps name??   A little obsessed I would say.
What do you mean by “you will follow the law” ???? That’s not an answer
HOW CAN SHE BRING SOLUTIONS TO ECONOMICS ISSUES  WITH HER BACKGROUND AS A PROSECUTOR? NO RELATIONS ON THIS TWO ISSUES.
Is she getting paid by the word?
Is she really wearing those earrings again🤦🏼 Bluetooth earing you can buy online
Can she answer a question?
What about Hurricane Victims
Hey Brett, why did you edit the trump video, and leave out the enemy inside comments? Hey Brett, why were you so disrespectful to the Vice President of the United States? Hey Brett, stop with the facelifts, you look weird. You interrupted more times than I’ve ever seen from you. Sad display of journalism and gotcha politics, you have made yourself irrelevant.
What is she talking about?????? Any body some body i am absolutely seriously what is she talking about??
How much did they need to edit this one too
Why can't we share this on IG? Weird
How tf do u invite someone for an interview and not let them finish their questions?  VP Harris did a great job of correcting and redirecting
Why does he keep talking over her? It’s so obnoxious.  She handled his act really well and will be able to handle similarly hostile world leaders like Putin.
Martha Raddatz was harder on JD Vance than Bret Baier was on Kamala.  Wonder why that is?
Who funded Iran???
Bret asks a question but then rudely interrupts her mid sentence?  Over and over same thing! At least she got some facts out. Also her website where she has 80 pages of detailed policies.
Isn’t it funny that Harris only has one pair of earrings?
Can she answer a single question? I can not continue to listen here. I cannot stand listening to here. I am just going to watch victorious secret show.
How come stupid people lead America?
Why would she have 80 pages of things she will change about America? Does she fundamentally want to change America  ?
The fact inmates are given options for tax dollars to pay their transition costs and medication etc….what are we doing as a society? Meanwhile public school is a joke, single mothers can’t afford food, seniors can’t afford medication…..  Sorry, nope, do the crime do the time…no extras.
What a dumb bltch, all she knows how to do is talk and whine about trump and give the same word salad answer for every question.
Where is our nation going with this woman( I hope is a woman) that has zero sense of the state of our nation.
Can you plz answer the question??
Is this a deep fake?
HUH,just answer the question ?
Was FOX this tough with Trump?...nah, just softballs that he could not even hit.
Does she have the same bluetooth earrings on that she wore during her debate with Trump?
Ok Lady...what's the plan???
Yep, same transistor earings, I wonder who is in charge whispering into the ear of this puppet?
Sorry for her loss? What about sorry for letting you down about what horrible job I did with the border.
How on earth did this woman become VP???
Has anybody noticed that Kamala is wearing the same “earrings” that she wore in the last debate with Trump?
Burning down cities?
Who is locking people up if they dont agree with them?  The Democrats.
Where’s the southern accent?
Nice Botox job Bret! Did you get a reference from Matt Gaetz?😂
All she has going for her is talking about Trump. What can she do with using his name??? I’d love to see an interview with her not say his name once.
I wonder if it’s physically possible for Kamala Harris to ever speak the truth.
She sounds like joe biden jr. Are they both taking the same stuff?
Lol word salads why ?
Does a lying liar ever stop lying? Evidently not.
how can anyone vote for her after the past 4 years?
What is the point of having an interview without answering any of the questions?
How did the Bushs' regular Americas survive 8yrs of Clinton and 8yrs of Obama and Trump's GREAT America get utterly destroyed in 2 1/2yrs by a senile Biden who doesn't even know his own name?   Not so great
How can this be our leader?
I thought this interview was to be about her and what she can and has done? Not bashing Donald Trump!
Ain’t she from India?😂
What is she talking about!
Why does she keep moving her hand like that??? All she’s doing is mimicking Obama. I just picture her practicing in the mirror with that hand.
Did anybody else have difficulty seeing this? The video kept pausing, stopping or skipping to the next video.
Do you know how many votes she would gain if she just took ANY accountability. Her more than any you can see it’s all a weird act
Why do you people find it right that your country gets rich at the expense of other countries,to an extent you even dictate as to who has a right to get rich or not!
Did she even answer one question?
How did she ever end up in politics
WHAT IS THE PLAN!? She keeps talking about a “plan” but hasn’t said what that “plan” is!
Is just me or does she seem dumb and dull.
That transgender surgery stuff was during Obama administration and became a part of Obama care if I remember correctly? Wasn't it written into Obama care?
why does she ALWAYS have an insufferably smug expression on her face?!!?
Does this women have any idea what the difference is between truth and lie?
Can this idiot answer a question without blaming Trump?
I have one question....Who planted that bag of marbles in her head?
😂 does she even understand what he’s asking? Or she’s just refusing to answer the question?
What exactly is broken with the immigration system ?????????
Where are her children? Oh, right, she doesn't have any to know they are left starving in our streets.
is she so sorry she would drop out?
Has she answered a single question without trying to shift focus to Trump?
Is Obama on the other end of those earrings?
Is she just a pre recorded set of talking points? Shes not capable of any nuance? Seems like they need to come up with a more capable robot🤣.
What is this? Is this normal on FOX??? It was supposed to be an interview but keep cutting in when VP is talking. I am tired of those lower class behavior. Be professional.
Why didn't he brought up the illegal alien rate during trump and now
Those earrings, once again. Wonder who's in her ear?
Why let her finish? Do they let Trump and Vance finish on any interview on legacy media?
Anyone else catch the bogus stats about the “direction of country”? 79% say we are on the wrong track??? Footnote says “652 likely voters”… please don’t tell me you polled 652 voters and are trying to make it sound like 79% of the country believes we are “on the wrong track”. What kind of clown journalism is happening here?
General question:  Something, something? Harris answer:  Yeah but, Donald Trump...
We want to to hear it from the horses mouth? Why your actions aren’t in line with your words
Why is she funneling money to them through proxies.....
Is it just me or does she sound a bit tipsy ?
This is a democracy? I thought it was a republic?  My 80 iq  can’t keep up obviously.
What about Harris letting go Priests who abused children ..in San Francisco ..
Where is the evidence where Donald has said these things from south africa
Whose idea was it for her to set herself up this bad? lol.
Can she answer a freaking question? How the hell can I vote for this special needs campaign.
Do you regret? The answer was? I am waiting.
Kamala is so good at lying. Are Americans really that stupid to believe her?
Lets be real is anyone on the fence? We know what they both want and what they both bring to the table.
Where are these unedited clips Kamala?
Can the guy let her talk? Geez, he tried so hard to twist the facts.
What clip is it then tell us
Did she not know who Brett is? Brett would treat Trump just like her.
So how are you going to be different from JB? Well i am (physically) not JB. Wow
You wouldn’t answer Brett so I’ll ask it too. Why doesn’t 76% of the country think you and Biden have done a terrible job???
Why she kept blaming Donald Trump while she and Biden are in the office?
Props for her showing up for an interviewer that won't cater to her but desperate times call for... I can see what people mean by 'word salad' and another word for that, 'denial' or 'lack of accountability.'  How can you trust someone who never takes ownership and plays blame game with every question?
How about old parents that can’t afford health care and groceries?
How come she continues to wear the same earrings?
Anyone else notice how this idiot NEVER directly answers a question? She has absolutely no clue and has no answer; she only knows how to go around a question by pointing her finger at Trump. The only threat to America is Harris!
Not even wearing the erring she is doing good, but can she stop using these or other earrings when going to interviews nor anything similar….? The similarity is too striking…
Does Harris know how to speak instead of repeating old speeches over and over?
is she wearing the same earrings as the debate? she sounds like a straight assclown
She have a earpiece on again? If she did wow they are terrible as she is
What has she done for the last four years?
Never a single direct answer.  Word salad always.   This is what we have coming.  People will be in the DARK for a long time in the future.    Why are we Americans paying from our tax dollars for all these immigrants?  Why are we.americans paying for other countries wars etc.?
Are these economic experts who claim her economic policies will be better for the economy the same experts who claimed inflation was going to be transitory?
Anybody else notice she had the bluetooth earrings on again? The same ones from the debate...
So...when texas put up Constantine wire why did the federal government remove them??????????
How is your polling close. What is going thru American people's mind is this what you want for a president?
Why csn she not answer a question without blaming Trump
Is this an interview or a debate with Trump with Brett's masked face? He wanted to misrepresent Trump's comments that she caught him red handed. Use your brain.
And what answers has trump  given?  You people act as if your blind she held her own and she's very knowledgeable   unlike trump yet you all hold him to nothing I think you all are brainwashed by trump
He should ask this vile woman about the bus loads of paid actors that show up to her pathetic events and speeches? And how much do they get paid? And is it tax payer money?
Where is the question about censorship?? About Ukraine? About the 800 us bases around the world
Can you imagine having eight more years of that
Why didn't he ask her to take out her ear rings/hear devices
Sooo, bascially a tyrant?
She has not followed The US Constitution, so how would she follow the law?
Why is she unhealthily obsessed with Trump? 😂🤣😂
Do we have peaceful pro Palestine protestors under sleepy zho and Kamala or BLM movement who were rioters and looters ??
How could any one vote for that?
Democrats wanted to fix the problem at the border.  What was the problem in the first place?  Does anyone know what the problem is/was she keeps referring to?
What an ignorant human. Refuses to simply answer a question!  "Unburdened by what has been."   SHE PLAIGERISED KARL MARX!!!
Is looking down and to the left mean the person is lying or remembering?? She does that a lot
So this is the best the left has?
Would you look at her? lol! All tense and irritated. She is not that smily anymore.... finally, they are pressing her real hard!
Big L for the Harris team. Why would they let her go on this?😂im glad they did though
Harris couldn't answer a straight question if you asked her if the sky is blue?   Harris is the walking, talking, steaming pile of crap!  Baier NEEDED to hold her to answer the questions he asked.  He lets of ramble on with her word salads without holding her to task.   The questions are better, but still not making her answer the question instead of lettering her blather on.  VERY disappointed in how Bret let her ramble instead of making her give STRAIGHT answers and call her out when she lies (which was most everything she said).
Why wasn't Biden there   he is the president
Is it a coincidence that those are the same earrings that she was accused of having Bluetooth in and those are the only earrings she wears anymore
Is it just me, or is her right eye cocked to the right??? 😮 even her eye is for the right! 😂
What did you do this 4 years you are in the office?
What did you do this 4 years you are in the office?
WHO wants to lock people up for disagreeing??? ummm 🦗🦗🦗They keep saying that about people who are speaking out on social media...
People wonder How Kamala Harris became, The vice president? (Let alone a presidential candidate) But Instead they should be asking how was she even a lawyer, she could barely form a sentence, and is not really good at being cross questioned?
My question to KH is, if you are blaming Trump for blocking the bill, what good would the bill do even if it was passed since the bill  was allowing 1.8 million unvetted illegal immigrants in the US daily?
How many of her people quit her ?
Did she say Trump has “to take responsibility for what happened during your administration” and yet spent the entire time blaming other people for the actions that took place during her administration?
Trump wasn't president during that bill proposal. What was the point in voting him out if he has that kind of power???
Why doesn't anyone in the media or politics know how to pronounce fentanyl? Its not fentinall
did she answer any questions?
Why would she even want a job that requires so much responsibility?
The Guadalajara Cartel felt apart before Kamala’s time why did she mentioned that Cartel?
What a horrible interviewer this man is! Asks a question and consistently interrupts her as she is trying to respond!
Why can't she just answer the question? She keeps playing the blame game. I am so tired of them blaming trump for the problems they created.
Chat, was trump a president during 2020 to 2024?
Interviewer: What's 2+2?   Kamala: "Let me be clear, Donald Trump"
So what was the # for the first question? God she is awful
in the "last decade" (10 years? So 2014-2024) 6/10 years were Democratic  presidencies right? (Obama-Trump-Biden)?
Is she serious right now?😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I wonder if any of the things on her website are copy pasted like the work she claimed as her own in her book. These crooks need some timeout in a prison cell to think about what theyve done.
LOL!!!!! Is she getting Grumpy??????     LOL!
Is this an interview or a debate? 20 years ago, Fox's bias used to be at least thinly disguised, but this is just horrifying beyond anything I thought I'd ever see in this country in my life.   I naively thought my generation (millennials) would bring the end of this kind of politics, but I fear this will only get worse.
She was a prosecutor??? Every case she ever litigated or prosecuted should automatically be re-tried.
Am I the only one seeing the same earrings?
Brett, why is she yelling at you? 😅😅😅
Could anyone imagine her having to deal with Putin and him not reducing her to tears?
Why I get this sense of feeling that she genuinely hates Trump?
Does she hear herself? I feel dumber from listen to her talk
They’re still sticking with the suckers line?
Wait, where is project 2025? Why never mentioned?
How many people has fentanyl  killed for the last 9 months since Donald Trump refused to let his speaker of the house to bring up to vote, That mmigration policy would have prevented a lot of deaths! Are we holding Trump responsible for all those deaths.or just what's convenient!
Is she ever gonna answer a question or just keep bringing up trump and how “bad” he is?
Will she be this way with world leaders?
But what was wrong with leaving the "remain in Mexico" policy until the border laws can be fixed in accordance with our constitution?
@Fox News @Kamala Harris Why was lethal force, to include drones now authorized by the military against civilians per DOD Directive 5240.01, 3.3, a(2)(c)(d) on September 27th 2024? See 20 minutes in.
Why can’t she take responsibility for her own actions
can she ever give a single straight answer??
How did she make it this far in life 😂
What about following morals and ethics
Again I'll ask: in that border bill, how much of the money went to our border and how much went to Ukraine? There's your answer why it didn't get passed. The Democrats intentionally made it unpassable.
Do you owe them an apology? Shaking her head universally for no while saying “she feels awful.”
Is she gonna answer the question
Why didn't Fox go live online with this interview?  They would have had an audience for it.
Why would anyone support, trust or vote for trump, an admitted pathological liar for anything, perhaps the same reason millions still support, defend, trust and believe him, they are Poorly Educated because they listen to fox.
Lol did she just implode?
Why did he keep cutting her off?
Why she doesn't take Trump's name from her mouth??? The questions are about her!!! She's terrible! Kamaĺa, you're FIRED!!!😂😂😂
Lots of interruption there. What's wrong with letting the woman speak?
Hello from europe.. Who hired that journalist? that was horrible journalism.
Wow… did she answer one question without a word salad full of BS crap? What a joke.
Why do half  of the Americans want Trump for president and don't believer her? Gee, Fox News, maybe it has something to do with you having to pay millions and millions of dollars for spreading lies and misinformation about her and President Biden. Hmmm
Why did her administration sick the government on the the January 6th people but nothing on the rioters and people who murdered, burned, and looted after George Floyd? Well????
What's her favorite flavour of ice cream??🤷
When are we going to hear her plan?  We already know EVERYTHING ABOUT DT
where do I sign up to become an illegal immigrant????? I sure could use a ebt card with 5,000$ a month, free college, free health care, free obarry phone, free 400$ a night hotel room, free laundry service, free food 3 times a day, and a free plane ticket anywhere of my choosing, also, imma need a free car to, and while we are at it, imma gonna need an apartment complex tax free of course
I have one Question.  Why was this interview so short??? Who was pressing him
how many Times did she physically Go to the Border??
Fox News quotes a study from Marquette Law School because it supported a gotcha question.   Seriously???
How can Trump be the negative of the last decade when Democrats have been in power for 12 yrs of the last 16 yrs?
Is she bruised?  She got beat badly!
Kamala has been in the presidency almost as long as Trump was. How is she so clueless?
So did he/she answer the question?
What are you turning from Kamala?
How many left wing earmarks were attached to those bills.
Kamala did your cat have kittens? Donald Trump had a cat Kamala is it cloudy outside? Donald Trump made it rain! She is obsessed with Trump! I wish she would answer one question with a straight answer!
Correct me if I'm wrong, isn't "the enemy within" that he refers to more about the crooks & lawbreakers within the government that need to be punished?
The sound is too quite on this one ?
But what type of family did she grow up in, was it middle class?
Was her plan to out talk the interviewer until she had to go?
Can she answer a question? Lol
Where the hell is the rest of the interview? C'mon Fox.
Who pays attention to the cost of an opponents ad if you're not worried?
The people that got fired?
How ...how are you strengthing the economy?  HOW!  GIVE US THE DETAILS!  BOUNCE IT OFF US! WE'RE NOT AS DUMB AS YOU SOUND.
Why is it that everyone is acting as if America doesn’t have its own issues with American citizens and crime? Why are they acting like someone crossing the border looking for a better doesn’t have the possibility of being killed by an American citizen. America need to focus on the crimes that are being committed right here in this country first before they start pointing fingers at others. Someone is killed every 11 minutes or less in this country by gun violence. But let point the finger at immigrants. Sound like they are just fitting right in with the rest of us.
Was this easy enough for the cult to understand??? I wonder.
so whats the experiment they're doing on silly old biden??
What good would more border agents do if you’re gonna tell them not to do their job and they’re going to become border chaperones?
How did he keep his cool interviewing her she didn't answer his questions instead does nothing but bring up trump which has nothing to do with the question. She is frustrating and soo difficult to get a response that is on subject
Why would anyone vote for Harris?
They gave Irsn a ton of money. WHY?
Is she that dumb or she's just acting?
The question is she really that dumb? She an embarrassment to women
How ...how are you strengthing the economy?  HOW!  GIVE US THE DETAILS!  BOUNCE IT OFF US! WE'RE NOT AS DUMB AS YOU SOUND.
How can she say the things she says with a straight face?
Did she answer any questions without mentioning her secret crush?
Do you owe them a apology? YES OR NO QUESTION? 😂 response dodge
Why ask her a question just to start talking again? My God.
Every interview I have seen clips of KH, she is wearing her debunked magic pearl earrings. Coincidence ?
Kamala: No teleprompter? Hey staff, what’s the plan?  Staff: uh, attack Trump. Kamala: Right.
Alright, Im suspicious now. This was the first time in what feels like forever a Democrat actually had hardball questions thrown at them.  What changed? Who got the call from Whom? This is starting to feel like a setup...
Why does she keep wearing those fbi made earrings??
Kamala, so why is our economy not strong? You’re going to strengthen what you weakened? That doesn’t make sense
Is she in mentally fit? None of her answers are matured and clear
Who is running country now?
How is this woman in the position she is, is beyond my comprehension
Is she running for president of isreal???
A supposed law school graduate doesn't know America is not a democracy?
Let me be clear? But nothing clear yet from your mouth
Has anyone else noticed that she has worn the same exact earrings in every single interview??
What the hell is the forgivable loan?  I've never been in a bank that features these.
why doesnt he just say it?  She keeps saying decades?  He was a president for 4 years of the last 12?

Does she know how to answer a question vote for trump she is so stupid
The Guadalajara cartel has been defunct since 1989, how did she do that?

What is this send military out thing?
Kamala, why don’t you deport those criminals who crossed or crossing illegally right now? And fix the border now?
Besides just disliking the way she talks, what issue do you have with anything she said? . . .
How connected is Kamala Harris to the World Economic Forum?  History shows quite the buddy buddy.
Question: If Trump is as bad as you say then why is half the US supporting him?  Kamala: This is an election for the president of the United States. Its not supposed to be easy 💁‍♂️🤡
What Republicans are supporting her?
Bro how do Americans find hope in this woman? 😂😂 Do you realise your president has to deal with other leaders as well as warlords, even African states dont respect her.

Why this guy don’t even let her talk ???
What happened to her accent?
I wonder if this dunce realizes that Trump has been out of office for years. All she/he does is blame him.
So while you fix the immigration system you just let them illegally come into our country??
Does she think we’re stupid?  Everything she says is the exact opposite of the truth. Everything she accuses Trump of, the Dems have actually done!  This is the bizarro world!
The real question should have been, will she truly ever be unburdened by what has been?!
What if her and Hillary were running against each other
Youve had democrats for 12 of the last 16 years. Why do idiots keep voting democrat?
Is there ever an interview where it doesnt end up being about Donald Trump?

Why does she sound like she’s always crying when she talks
We are talking about ads? Political ads here Wth? Please can you speak your own mind not other folks that hate your running mate? 💯
If you have already voted for her, what are your thoughts on this interview?
Can anyone of you Demacrats speak the TRUTH FROM THE HEART. I know you don’t and neighther do 90,000,000 people! SHAME SHAME SHAME ON YOU AND THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY
Who was Vice President in 2008? Who is the VP now? Did we have a recession during Trump’s administration? We are on the verge of a depression or hyper inflation… Why tf is Joe Biden still “El Presidente”? We need to stop supporting all these other countries and support ourselves!
Maybe it’s because I am looking on my cellphone but I can’t find the 80 pages of comprehensive policy. If you have seen these pages, can someone tell me how to access them?
It's an easy question, how many people illegally came across the border? Bret did a great job, unfortunately she had no intention of answering your questions.
Does she not realize that Obama was eight years? Trump was four Biden was four. She’s an idiot.
Peaceful protest?  Burning down buildings, tearing down historical statues, vandalizing landmarks, attacking police,..... I guess define peaceful Kamala.
what official position did she hold at macdonalds????? the girl behind the dumpster doing dirty things doesnt count
where is the dot on her forehead 😤
A plan that is sound? what are going to do to stop the exploding 35 trillion debt!
Bret only had 1/2 hr to question her. If he had not stepped in, she would have sidesteped all the other ?s by her babbling over one ? Which she still did not answer.
I wonder if Brett is getting the same migraine that I am getting listening to this #$%^
How is he going to ask a question, then cut her off while she is answering the question to ask another question. He had one goal in mind
Do the politicians running for office have to submit to a pre-employment drug screening?.. like she sounds high... I've known stoners who made more sense

What is she freaking out about? She’s the installed candidate.
So what are you offering on Iran?
Such an important conversation. Why should anyone try to wrap it up so quickly? What’s more important now?

Decade? Obama and Joe Biden and the democrats owned 6 out that 10 years ago
So, where are all the fact checkers?
Chips and salsa act??? Wow I didn’t know they did so much good. Sorry Brett can’t watch her for more than a couple minutes…
Why is a home wrecker word salader waffling about home buyers 😂
China is probably the biggest threat, if it is Iran, why allow them to sell oil? Allow them access to billions in frozen $?
Why does it seem like she's high?
How did she lie with a straight face?
HOW DEFENSIVE IS SHE? THE GUILTY ONE IS THE ONE WHO MUST GO TO SUCH EXTEND FOR COVER UP.
Remember when Trump resulted to racism when he had less pushback in the NABJ?   Can you interrupt your own question more?

Will she answer any question?
Are those the same earrings from the debate!??
What is so mad about it?? What clown she is !! Lol
Why did he let her steamroll over him? Why didn't he use a loud voice and tell her to stop interrupting him? He let her control the interview.
How long until dems start calling Fox News racist?
I wonder if she’s gonna do this with Putin
Can we get a translator?
7:19 who’s fault is it? A man who was not in office?
"What are they, stupid?"That was an interesting question!
Well, just exactly IS your plan?
Has anyone been swayed to vote her way after this interview?  What is she trying to do - chase the voters away - 80 pages of policies?? Really ....
Can somebody count how many times she says his name?

How many republicans are honest with themselves as to the power of trump being president for 4 years vs Harris being VP for 3.5??? Do republicans hold Pence accountable in the same regards as Harris?? How much power do they think VP’s have?? That’s only if they’re actually being honest with themselves!!
Why can’t she give hour long interviews like Trump?
I think Brett spent more time talking than Kamala. Is that how interviews work?
Can she not answer a question without mentioning Trump?  Trump this and Trump that.  Please answer the question VP Kamala.
4:00 do people really believe that she tried to close the border when she scrapped the wall?
She won’t give a number. 6 million? 15 million? 20 million?

The enemy within?????  That would be you.....she is out of control!!!!!  Best questions ever with not one clear answer!
What was that?? He asked a question and three words in he talked over her. Trump has no answers and you can’t hear her answers because he wouldn’t let her talk. Politics have become a game to the media when real live are at stake. I’m so glad there is a true and living God
Just me or she doesn't say anything of substance?
Wheres her accent?

Didn’t Obama give Irán like $450 mil cash his last day of office?
She just can't answer the question. Cannot. Will not. What else do voters need to see?!
Can you let her answer the question?! This is not good interviewing…but totally on brand for Fox News.
How many American men stalk women and the judicial system let them out to delete the same women that they were stalking. What about that?
Unclear why she came on here? Madam VP was drinking beer and laughing it up with Stephen Colbert while many states on the eastern side of our country were in crisis. Some states like North Carolina, Louisiana and Florida are still searching for their missing loved ones. Her true intentions have already been revealed. She also shows time again that she does not have her priorities in order; she prioritizes identity politics over the true needs of the majority of the American people.
Why she never answers the questions?! Can she ever get to the point.
Can she not talk without wobbling her head 🙄
What about the pain the American People are experiencing due to her & her adminstrations incompetence.
Doesn't she own any other pair of earrings I have seen her wear those earrings for every single interview... just saying it makes you wonder
What has this administration done to bring down costs?  Wages are stagnant, inflation is out of control and no one cares about her word salad.
Is she wearing the same earrings she wore at the Trump debate? Some people questioned if they were audio earrings.
Gender surgery for criminals and abortions for everyone. Is this really what America has become?
Why does she wear the same earrings that look like the ones that could  transmit  what to say to her.  It would make sense not to wear those to avoid  speculation..... just saying ... we are not stupid.
Wait Donald Trump was in the White House for a decade? Lol the dude was in a the White House 4 years ago… what is she talking about 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Will she ever stop lying ?
Are we electing a psychologist or a president? She is not telling us things she will do
how about jo biden  avoid the question
Why the hard stop?  Fox or Kamala limit?  Her time ain't that valuable.
I want the world to see more of her interviews. I also want to see shameless democrats watch her make these speeches. I now wonder who is more evil - harris or clinton? Maybe democrats know it better . I vote red.
80 pages of policy yet all she can talk about is Trump?
Do you think she wears a thong?
Does anyone remember last year when biden=harris "accidentally" sent iran 180 million to iran?
Then how come there is more billionaires and millionaires who are Democrats and Republicans?
Why is nearly half the country supporting a prolific liar, a wannabe dictator, a rapist and a convicted criminal?  Good question, says a lot about the intelligence and how informed and aware many Americans are.  Its as though morals and conscience don't matter anymore, very weird.

What's the over-under on her IQ 70 or lower??

Did her and her people think going on fox news would help?
We're a democracy??? I didn't get the memo!!!
Can we all be unburdened by her stupidity?
Flying in 40thou from TX border to CO is FIXING IMMIGRATION? Telling citizens what they're lived experience is their "IMAGINATION" denying this WHY? Read Denver Gazette.

Why no hyena kackles?  Reality sucks.
Can she answer the dam questions? Or she is clueless? I guess the latter?

Why the f@ck was Fox News so stingy with their time?  Couldn’t their gold and catheter ads wait a few more minutes to let Baier and Harris finish the interview?
What is she talking about???😅😂
Ranch or blue cheese with that sir/madam? 😂😂😂
Americans pointing fingers at each other? That the dems entire strategy. Divide then blame.
If Iran is the greatest threat to the US, why did Obama give Iran $400 million in cash to Iran, and then follow up with $1.7 billion in bank transfers. Later, under Biden/Harris, they sent $16 billion to Iran. And then $7 billion in military equipment left behind in neighboring Afghanistan? Or, did the democrats give Iran money and access to weapons to create a pretext to invade?
What about the people that have worked with her and they resigned? About 90 percent say she's unstable and mean.
how could she wait this long to do this interview. must not have been ready
Why do you keep taking down what I comment on YOUTUBE? No freedom of Speech HUH?

"Fixing" a Problem that she created?  Seriously?
last decade?  Trump was only 4 years of the last decade.  Get a life.
Why do you care about how much money he spending? It’s his money.
Did she answer a single question ? All she was doing was eating up the clock , and rambling to avoid giving answers and trying to control the convo .
Does she only have one set of earrings? $2 000+ suits but only ONE set of earrings? 🤔

Why don't interviewers ask VP Harris about the people who worked for her? And question the actual detailed cases she prosecuted in CA. Proof?
when will she realize that she’s being cut off so much is because she’s not answering the question the the reporters aren’t stupid.   oh wait it’s Kamala
Can you pull up a graphic showing all the Republican senators that voted against FEMA support for coastal communities? All of deaths out those good Southern folks are on the Republican party.
Then why did you let them in??
Was anything actually answered?
Who and why did they stop the interview?
Why can’t she answer even one single question?
The affordable housing the $25,000 Boost all this promises I got one question who is going to pay for it?
Has a Presidential candidate ever been THIS devoid of substance?
How many have been released Harris?  Answer the *** question.  Stop circumventing with the bs nobody wants to hear.
So why is there a catch-and-release?????????????? kakamala.
25:38 What happened here?
Do the Americans need another 4 years of idiots like her and her boss Joe
What kind of journalist ask a question and doesn’t be quiet to get an answer. He is very unprofessional.
So everything that happen this past 3.5 years was trumps fault ?
Trump reminds us of the age old question.. what kind of man sues his hookers? 🤪
What has she fixed in four years? Absolutely nothing, system is nearly broke
Who pays for this.
If she gets this upset over an interview, how could she handle a governmental crisis?
Does anybody have a tally on how many times she said Trump’s name?💔💔💔
why didn't you fix it
Why did Americans remove Trump? It was for change, right? But in the last four years, there has been no change—America is getting worse and worse. There are so many wars in the world involving US ... and then that woman comes here telling us 'Trump this, Trump that.... Just like a kid
Why would Biden sign all those executive orders BEFORE the bill passed?
Did we just witness a political self-deletion spreedrun?
@20:55 Who’s the unstable one!?
Answer the question for the love of god! Why is she even an option?
1:34 This is the best the Democrats can do?
Who is voting for this nutcase?
Does she really only own that one pair of earrings??? 👂 👂🔊🔊🧏‍♀️🤔
Who was giving him a "hard wrap"?? No way would Fox try to end the interview early, why would they? So I'm guessing Harris' handlers were ending the interview early?
Dude “for example:” then says absolutely nothing … $25,000 for a house? Ha sorry California! 🤦‍♀️
This hoe can't answer a single question. Let me be clear... Is this really the best person we could produce to lead our country?! Vote Trump and get this trash out of our government!!
If she cant even sit with a journalist without getting wound up how will she handle herself with world leaders?
Who’s unstable? It looks like she is to be honest, look how she gets so mad
Why doesn’t she talk about how the first paragraph of that immigration bill was to give funds to Ukraine
How are those earrings working out for you now?
I actually feel sorry for her. I believe lawyers don't care, so it might not matter so much to her, but what could she say that is true and exonerates her?
Gee Brett why don't you ask those people why ???
Why did he let her weasel out of the Border Bill question? It was a Ukraine Bill with some provisions for the border. That's why it was voted against by Republicans.
Where the Jamaican accent mon??
Brett hopes Kamala got out what she wanted to get out? And that they invited her so viewers can get to know her? Meanwhile, Brett talks over Kamala when he/Fox doesn't want the viewers to understand what she's saying. Fox is trying to prevent Kamala from getting the truth out. But she held her ground and got it out.
Joe Biden is not on the ballot? It seems to me he was throughout the Primary...
The past decade???! Uhhh the past decade has been dominated by democrat leadership....what world is she living in?
How does she look at herself in the mirror?
Can we get one question answered ?
Question: why most of people likes Trump? Because of Fox News.
Lol Marquette law school poll?!? You reaching Deeeeep fox
Trump's plan weakens economy? Really? Sorry, Americans aresmarter than that! Turn the page? She has more than 3.5 years, now turning her page? or what page?
What does the thing mean with the slip, " when we're president"??
How much booger sugar is she on? Wow, talk about nasal drip
What about the laws that were CURRENTLY IN PLACE?????  If they needed a new bill to close the border, how did Donald Trump bring it to the lowest levels ever.
Is she hooked up in her earings
Does she ever answer a question directly?
So, why did trump refuse to do the 2nd debate with Vice President Harris? also, why did trump refuse to do an interview with 60minutes? which, by the way, has been a long time tradition that every single presidential nominee goes thru...trump was the only one who declined it. It's MIND boggling  🙄
The question is simple. How many?
Trump has NO plan! Really?
Same ear rings! Is that the only pair she owns?   Look it up they are ear phones, they cost thousands.
WHat's up with those same earings????? Hmmmmmm... seems suspect!!!!
I'm guessing she regrets agreeing to this interview?
How many immigrants?  The point is … you can’t answer the question about 20 million you allowed into the country…the immigration problem is what you CREATED.. so “let’s be very CLEAR!”
Why doesn’t Trump get grilled like this when he is on Fox? Because he’s an old man that if they talked to him like this, he would just leave 😭😭😭
If Donald Trump was so unfit and dangerous why were we all so happy for 3 years?!!!!!!! And miserable for these 4 years.... Starting with Obama.... Which was gradual  🙏✝️
What about your Diddy parties
@1:45 she fails to answer the question. 'Do you regret changing those policies?'   She refused to answer it and redirected. How does everyone accept this garbagee?
Can she talk without talking about Trump
Why blame Trump when you and Joe told them to come to the border before you were elected?
Why is he cutting her off every time she attempts to speak?
Are you guys watching her other interviews besides this one? Or you’ve already made up your mind so at this point it doesn’t matter to watch?
What has she done in the present administration??
So deportation of illegal immigrants that commit crimes is deporting Americans???! They constantly demean Trump and call him a threat to democracy. They have jailed people who disagree with their policies. BS!
They were softball questions.. the question he should ask , why don’t you close the border now ?
What about when she called people 18-25 stupid?!
Who is locking who up, Kamala?
She's so awesome!!!!  Vote blue!!!!  Ask me why?  GO KAMALA GO!!!!!
Anyone have a count on how many times this idiot said Trump? If I were taking a whiskey shot everytime she said his name, I would die from alcohol poisoning!
Who are you in last 3 years?
SAME EARRINGS.... right?
Do y’all think they’re just actors and it’s a script and the elites run ts they are just actors and making a real life tv show for us and putting how stupid Kamala Harris is right in peoples faces then laugh so hard when people vote for her
What does clear mean? Im confused
Trump is totally unfit and insane. Question: What about Biden ? Ohh Biden is sharp as a pencil 😂😂😂😂
is she reading from something, why isn't she looking at him LMFAO
Here's my question, if as Kamala Harris, says the Joe Biden is on the top of his game and making sound decisions, why then did the DNC, Congressional leading personalities, such Pelosi and Schumer, and theparties elites push Joe Biden off the ticket and insert Harris in his place?
And some people think she is President material?   Baffles me.
Has anyone actually gome to that website and see the plan?
Is she ok?  Very scary.
What is wrong with this guy? Was he raised by a pack of wolves. You asked a question. Let her answer the question.
When are you going to call Har on her lies about Trump??
Her body position seems EXTREMELY guarded.  What does she have to hide?
Fixing a problem? You’ve been doing since day one is creating the problem now you want to fix it laugh out loud that’s like me slapping you in the face and then pretending like somebody else hit you and I said I’ll protect you next time.
Do you Trump voters understand he wants to forcibly remove millions of people of color? Do you realize Trump will send military into US communities and literally forcibly enter thousands of homes and arrest them detain (possibly in internment camps) or just deport people?
I thought Trump built a wall. What happened to the wall? Didnt Trump fix that?  Why did Trump then block a border security bill?
Can you ask yourself if you can hear what you are talking about Vice President..?
… those earrings 🤔 … does she have any other pair?
So if Biden was 100% why did he get pushed out by you?
So....whats her favorite flavor of ice cream?
Why don't she do it now?; how come the hurricane victims have to apply for that $750 and some of them are getting turned down?
Wait,Wasn’t it Biden who threatened to use Nucks on the American people. As an argument to get rid of the second amendment?
If Bret can absolutely unravel her, what do you think foreign leaders will do to her?  They will chew her up and spit her out.
Let’s not forget trumps puppet masters are the architects of project 2025, a fascist takeover of America. Is that what freedom loving Americans want?  Women, you want to lose more of your freedoms? People of color who vote for Trump, you want to risk losing more of your hard earned rights and freedoms?
Doesn't she look tired?
Why is she on the ballet if Biden is fit and sharp?
How does she know he spent $20 mill on the ad. Did her Mainstream Media Cartel give her the receipts
How did she get through Law school??
WHAT HAPPENED HERE IS QUESTIONS TO SET HER UP TO LOOK BAD AND AS SHE EXPLAINS HERSELF HE INTERRUPTS HER TIME AFTER TIME HE WONT LET HER SPEAK!!
If Biden is so competent and has the right judgement, why do the Democrats want him to be replaced?
Why wasn’t it 1/2 hours long.
what was that first question???
How the hell could this woman have been a prosecutor?  She can't argue her own case, how could she have argued for the state of CA?
How do you spell arrogant nothingness?  Kamala. Case closed.
see who is locking up who? trump is being persecuted by the democrats.. and their rhetoric led to assassination attempts at Trumps life... who is gaslighting who... we are not stupid to see what democrats are doing!!  straight at the communist playbook
Does she not understand that we can go back and read the transcripts of every different meeting that's been held in office.. we could find out what she really did... if I'm wrong somebody please explain to me how it's done... when she looks down someone is feeding her word salad
Locking people up for going against you?????? Your party madam vice president is the only party whonis doing that!!!!
What  about Willie's wife?
She is a puppet, who’s the puppet master pulling the strings?
This interviewer was horrible. Did he ask her what her plan is?
This is the question I'd like to have her answer:  "If Biden is so competent, so energetic, so spry, so capable, why Madame Vice President, are you even here?  Why isn't Biden still on the ticket?"  Baier got close but she filibustered over it.
Has she actually  ever answered a question?
Hey, Bret - How about learning how to shut the hell up after you've asked a question and let your interviewee get a word in edgewise?
Bidens health problems were right in front of her and she couldn't see them ? How can she possibly deal with our enemies and what they are up to ? She needs to be able to interpret body language as a president. Its not all about the words.
How is she still blaming Trump 3 years later
Arent they the ones censoring videos in California? Calling for censorship through all states?
20:10 Why is she getting so angry over a question?
It’s so hard to listen to her…does she have her Bluetooth earrings on again?
“What plan? She can't even explain what her plan is.”
Why is she always wearing those pearl earrings when she has an interview as well as the debate?
Where she will get the money for the $25,000 for buying a house?  How could they buy a house if there‘a no work?  Hahaha
Who’s voting for Kamala? ❤
Is there anything she takes responsibility for ? It is unreal that she absolutely blames on TRUMP for everything and he was not in power the last 3 years … turning the page from Trump ! ??? Really ??!!!!
Something to think about: Aren't those the same controversial earrings?
The question is, who was pressuring Bret to end the interview. I'm guessing it wasn't Fox News because I'm betting people could watch at least an hour if not more of an in-depth interview. Does she not want to make her case to the American people or is she too busy for that?
Gender surgeries in prison??? They've lost their rights - what do they need surgeries for?
Does she ever use other earrings other than the listening device pearls?
She looks so angry. Where is the joy scumala?
Had 4 years already and did nothing at all. BUT when she gets in office she will?
Those earrings again?
Anyone on here who is now voting for Trump after this interview? Curious minds
can some please explain to me what she's talking about?
Is he going to let her answer any question? My God he is annoying af.
Why she mix so many words and not answer  the question so is very clear to me I  will never ever I will vote for her
Why they always ask her about Biden like what part of she wasn’t the President don’t they understand
Is she have her two-way earrings in?
Are those the same earrings she was wearing during the debate? Nova H1’s the one where she is able to be instructed on what to say? Ohh ya it is..
Why does she always blame Trump?  And she is rude to always interrupt. And she never takes responsibility and she has never apologized to those families.  Smh,  thank you fox
Am I the only one that keeps hearing "what has been burdened" in my head, when trying to listen to her speak???
I feel dumber after watching her. Is that what's supposed to happen?
I grew up in a middle class family! What was the question  Btett?
Who is voting for Trump?❤
Tell me do you blame Pence for trumps presidency mistakes and policy?
you guys realize the vice president has no control over what bills are passed and cannot take any executive action to create legislation right? RIGHT??
When Brett is blaming Harris on Lakin Reilly where is his concern with all of the people that have died since Trump killed the border bill.  Anyone who has died since he killed the Lankford bill is on Donald Trump's conscious (if he had one).
What a joke she is. Cannot answer 1 question
is this her fox news accent ?
Is she wearing those earrings again?
How many black men did she put in jail unfairly?
I the only one that noticed that she is wearing the same earrings from the debate? And pauses before answering🤔
Why would anyone take fox seriously after they paid almost a billion for lying? Fox viewers are wilfully stupid
Facts? If she wants facts she needs to stop[ lying.
What's up with her pinching her fingers together? She's such an amateur.
Where is she getting the $25k and how?
NOT ALLOWING HER TO SPEAK! Typical trump supporters behavior with anyone! That was a dumb question to ask her how many illegal immigrants have crossed the boarder. How is she suppose to know that answer?? trump supporters are dumb asf and irritating!!!
What about Willie's kids, did you harm that family to,
When is Trump going to do a sit down interview with CNBC and MSNBC?  🐓🐓🐓🐓🐓🐓🐓🐓🐓🐓🐓🐓
Penalties? 😂😅 B they're flowing through the boarder like water 🌊.
Q. Who is our greatest adversary?  A. Iran is Israel's greatest adversary.
ask yourself, who would you rather have a verbal contract with?
did she call him Ben around 2:50?
11:49 When is she gonna take responsibility for what happened under the Biden/Harris administration?
What is this garbage she's spewing about Trump saying he's going to use the military against US citizens, lock up people who disagree with him, and so on?? He has never suggested any such thing. I do wish Brett would have pointed that out. Is someone on her staff telling her he has said these things? Not only lies but the type of lies that lead to assassination attempts. Trump has specifically said he wouldn't engage in law fair. Hillary was a criminal and he did nothing about it. It's HER and Brandon's administration that has tried to lock up Trump.
Does she ever answer a question? Wow.
She could not. Answer one question,WOW?📢📢📢
Doesn't let her answer First question and then seques into his bias agenda, with totally different derogatory question. 😔
Brett why are you letting her control this interview??! She has all this rhetoric that takes up most of your interview!
Who the hell would vote for this woman??
Bluetooth earrings? No plan still
What is her obsession with trump 🤣 can we count how many times she mentioned him? 🤣
Why are we so concerned about (rare) cases of transgender care in the prison system?  There are actually serious issues to address.  Yet instead for some reason we focus on scapegoating.
What about sending FEDERAL RESOURCES TO REMOVE THE BORDER Texas set up????
Q: When did you notice that joe biden was declining? A: why talk about joe biden when trump is running for presidency 😂
Why is She Talking over the Guy and Then Keep Blaming and Blaming Trump and I didn't learn anything about her Policies and or Plans what a Great Joke 🤣🤣🤣🤣 .....
Where's the Harris who can't talk without a teleprompter? Did Fox News lie to me?
If she wins I wonder how long she is going to keep blaming Trump for everything? Think it will go all the way until she leaves the white house?
Over the last decade ? We went from great under Trump to crap under Biden / Harris .
Do people seriously want this woman to be president? She's clueless and offers no solutions!
Is ‘clear’ a word she just learned?
Fix housing… how about blackrock stops buying housing driving cost up ? Thats better than 20k for people.
Is this the full interview??
She is exposed pretty badly and is desperately trying avoid the question. First question was how many illegal immigrants? Never answered. This is the bluff Americans need to call it in this election.
OMG! Does this Women Ever say what she’s going to do? She says a Lot, but says Nothing.
do you know the innocent colored people that have been killed 2016-2019 under trump administration if not DO YOUR KNOWLEDGE done thinking for you'll tighten up
22:13 Were these the same people that told us the laptop was Russian disinformation??
Does she even know what a decade is??
What exactly is her "plan?" She's just not presidential material. She's just not very bright.
Where was this 💩 head 4years ago ? 🙈🙉🙊
Who is paying for all her proposed hand outs?   Oh yeah, US in higher taxes, great!!! 🤮
Does she own a another pair of earrings? Funny how those pearl earrings are the only set she ever wears when answering questions on any stage, in any location friend or foe.
Can this H answer one question
Is she running against herself?
Why can’t she answer a question
If we blame the former president for everything, is there a need to elect a new president? What can you do as a new president?
Wow!! Did anyone else notice that not one, single question was actual answered?
What has she done for the American people as a Vice president 😂😂😂
How can people still believe in her omg🙉
Deflect. Obfuscate. Filibuster. Repeat. How is this even close?
Why she start yelling at him?
3:54 Wait what? Why did Trump ask senators to vote against an anti immigration bill?
Does trump ever answer any question coherently?
I wonder if she knows how stupid she is?
I wonder if she realizes how unlikeable she appears
Do yall really understand how government work?   Congress, meaning the senate and house vote on the bill. She had 33 tie breaking votes, in which she approved.    She does not make all the decisions, that’s the president, of course she didn’t do xyz because she doesn’t have the power to do so.
Answer the question. Do you support it or not????
Are we supposed to spend the next 4 years listening to these evasive super long non-answers? No thanks!
Why does he ask her a question and then interrupt her answer and talk over her?  He needs to shut up. He is effing annoying.
When are you people going to finally understand that it's Trumps fault that I did what I did. Aren't you dumb enough to understand that?
My question to Republicans is this: are you so misinformed that you don't know your candidate is losing his mind or are you so stupid that you don't think it matters?
Does she really think we don't remember what she has done to this country for the last 4 years
How you ask someone a question and interrupts them while they are answering? Its like he doesn't want the truth
Don't let her run on with a campaign add. Brett needs to shut her down and tell her he is going to interrupt her if she doesn't first answer the question.
If you know theres a major problem at the border and knew it when Trump was in office WHY DID YOU REMOVE 90 EXECUTIVE ORDERS OPENING THE BORDER UP?
Wasn’t this supposed to be an hour long? Looked like Brett was being yelled at to stop the interview at the end 😂
Question so if Biden is ok why did they replace him with you??
Did he freshly stretch that flesh over his skull before this interview?
What?????? A reporter asking real questions!?!?!?!
What is the"plan"? Ask Brett, but you won't
Trump is unstable but Biden was brilliant making decision after decision……. Whaaaat??? LOL
Those who support Trump are either part of his MAGA cult or are pretending that they prefer his economic policies. He hasn’t articulated clearly any economic policies so is it really his cruelty and racism that some are supporting him for?
Does she think shes good at this? She acts like a criminal
What is wrong with this man's actual face? Why is no one talking about how this man doesn't have a human face?
What a disgrace didn’t answer single question
Where's the lie?
can Brett not sit up straight?
Is she kinda slow?
20:30 should US president be able to handle criticism without getting visibly angry?
I wonder if Trump has the guts to do an  interview on MSNBC? 😂😂😂 😅
If Joe Biden was so good, why did the top democrat leadership force him to step down from running?
Concepts of a plan are better than an actual plan right?
Why didn't she do all these things 3 years ago?
Now when is Donald Trump's interview with Anderson Cooper???
Has she ever answered a single question?
My question is, who's running for president against Trump? Why keep bringing Biden back in since he's not running?  What is the purpose of asking her about him when in less than a month we will have a new president?
Does anyone know what she stands for now? The only thing I know is that she blames everything on President Trump. 🤦🏻‍♀️
Why do we need to go to a website when this women who sleeps with married men can not tell Americans what she stands for without blaming a person who hasn't been president in 4 years while she has been the vice president for 4 years. Open your eyes.
How are those Bluetooth earrings working for you Camela?
Is she on bluetooth?
@17:25 what is going on here?
What’s the number?     Harris: let’s get to the point and ignore the question
Man! How many Valium pills did she swallow before this interview? What happened to her usual pot smoking cackling giggles?
How can you vote for Trump when his own Vice President pick hates his guts? If your own VP hates you, why should I even vote for you?
During last decade, Trump was in office for only 4 yrs??
Is she wearing those earrings again ?
How is it that a man not in office has more power than the sitting President and Vice President?   Each time the Biden administration blames Trump for affecting policy while they are in office just speaks to their ineptitude.
A Democracy or a REPUBLIC?!? Wonder if the  VP should know that?
So because you didn’t get your bill passed you just made the problems worse?
Why she so angry?
Why is she stalling so much and not answer the questions?
Can you see the strings?
Yooooo aren't those the SAME earrings she wore during the debate? The ones from debate looked like audio earring and they look the same!!
What will u turn the page from? 😂😂😂 Awesome!
What did she mean by what we would do as president of the united states? Shouldn't she have said what I would do as president of the US?
Is she reading straight from Karl Marx? Those quotes she's using...
Why is she  so  short in height
Fox news evidence regarding Iran and sactions for kamla is to show numbers of Iran oil revenue going up at the same time inflation also has occured? Lmfao Also correlation isn't causation.
Why did he keep cutting her off and interrupting her ....he refused to let her give a truthful answer because he saw where she was herding him lol she mopped the whole floor with him😂🎉😂😅
When is Trump's interview on MSNBC?
In the past decade democrats have been in charge more than Donald Trump.  Is this lady serious?  Turn the page from the nonsense her own people have done.  Right.
Is she wearing her special earrings again
She speaks in questions: "Working. .  with the heads of our military?. . . to support Israel in its requirement to defend itself?. . . including Iran's proxies in the region? . . . and my commitment to that is unyielding?" (I recognize the behavior because it's something we used to do when I was in college, back in the 60's. It's a sort of "Valley Girl" speak.)
Ask her about Willie Brown! And her car and several hundred thousands of dollars in salary over those who were in that job years before her. Ask her if Willie Brown’s wife will be voting for her? 😂
Where has this Kamala Harris been when it came to campaign. 🙏🏻🇺🇸
Can she say a sentence without saying Trumps name? 😂
Did or did not the secretary of defense under this administration just authorize the military to use deadly force against the american people he's the one that had to approve this directive
If harris wins who will she blame for America's problems? That should be a very real question.
Why was she turn away like she was listening ?
Is she serious, the Biden-Harris admin threatened federal workers their jobs for not taking the Covid vaccine. Some did loose there jobs. They told social media platforms to sensor facts on the effectiveness of the vaccine in which most were true.
what a waste of time.   can she actually explain a policy instead of just bashing Trump?
Is this the whole interview?? I can’t find anything longer anywhere else lol if she can’t do this for longer than 30 mins, NO WAY she’s doing Joe Rogan.
Please just answer the question Skamala????
So if this is a democracy then why did the democrats shove Joe Biden out and replaced him with Kamala Harris whom the American people of the Democratic Party didn’t nominate????
WHAT was that?? 2 people having a conversation about 2 different topics at the same time. Yikes! She has a lot of substanceless sentences in her repertoire!
Is she sorry for people suffering and lost their love ones because  of open border? I don’t think so because birds is still open
What is wrong with her. 😮
Can’t she just shut up and listen to a question?
I've never thought that 80-pages worth of policies would be considered comprehensive. Also, why is it that her declarative sentences sound like questions? Listening to her for so long made my head hurt.
If they need more resources at the boarder, then why did Kamala and Biden make boarder patrols jobs harder?
“when were you aware of Joe Biden’s diminished faculties?” To point out how could she diagnose DJT as unstable if she couldn’t recognize Biden’s failed mental capacity. Great question that went right over her head!
Anyone know which CARTEL she went against? And if TRUMP spent $20 mil who gave her the bill or are hers 1/2 price?
Why is a bill necessary to send security to the border?
How many was the question
what the hell is this. Is she restarted ?
Why doesn't she just answer the question.? Exactly what a Liar does- avoids the truth with a bunch of ignorant words. She's a puppet and everyone can see it  At least with Trump we know when he stands and bravely speak just what he means  IM FOR TRUMP AND JD. May GOD Bless Both of Them!!!
Why does she wear the same earrings for interviews/debates?
Who wrote those policies when you cannot put two and two together!
Don't ask me about my policies...go to my website.....lol
How long before Brett regains his IQ After this?
Why was illegal immigration lower under the prior administration? What changed between administrations? Is growing government the only answer to the crisis  that was manufactured by changes made in border policy?
Where's the southern accent?
Be able to handle....say...an interview??
What is interviews happen after they start voting and it's like seriously
Wasn't the border bill she claimed that she wanted to pass and that trump somehow blocked not being in any current political seat, was also about sending the majority of the money within that border bill was actually about sending more money to wars overseas and not even our own needs?
My questin would be to VP Haris would be why are you such garbage?
how can a rational-competent person who understands the language attentively watch this and vote for her? how?
lead a country? this lady can't even lead a pencil
To every conservative on here acting like the first question asked by Bret Baier was an actually honest question. Imagine Trump going to an interview on CNN, MSNBC, or any other network and the first question asked by the interviewer is "So when you were President 2020, how many American Citizens did you let die from COVID?". That's the type of questions Bret Baier is using. It's not honest, earnest questions. It's talking points disguised as questions. The very definition of gotcha journalism.
Can someone please ask her what exactly are her policies
Did she even pass the bar?
how does she know his ad cost $20 million dollars?
Can Trump go to CNN next? She’s stood in front of Faux News and she did well, when is Trump going to a left leaning channel to do an interview? Not even 60 minutes?
Can we go to her website and ask for a refund from ukraine. I didnt agree to that
Are those the same ear rings she had on for the debate?
Handle criticism…!?🤔 20m in you’re gettin pretty worked up being challenged to justify an abysmal DIE Vice Presidency! 😂
She's wearing the earrings that work as an ear piece again. Am I the only one to notice this ? She wore the same earrings during the Trump debate. Theree is a company that makes these. I cant remember the name of the company though.
My question is why do republicans not want a bill but instead want 90 executive orders for one issue.... why does half the country support him?? BECASUSE THEYRE JUST LIKE HIM.
Does anyone else find her totally nauseating or is it just me?
Why didn’t we have this problem to this degree before her admin took office?
Can she just answer a question? Shes a dancer, dances around every question!
Does she know that Iran already has nucas?
Didn't Kamala keep inmates incarcerated longer than sentenced for labour. Sounds like slavery
How the hell was Trump involved with that border security bill when he wasn’t a politician?
Joe Rogan tomorrow?
She's offering a plan?  What plan?
Do we want to talk about what a staff member has to say about you? I really don’t think you want to go down that road Madam Vice President.
Because her adds don’t spread fear. Kettle black?!?
She really isn't capable of answering a question, is she?
Have you forgotten how bad Trump was as president? For God sake he had 4 years to fix immigration, build a wall and release his tax return.
ahmmmmm why is she getting riled up?????
Why do we need a new bill when you’re not enforcing current law?
Look at her earrings they are the same ones she had at the debate, the other interviews and this one too. I wonder??
What a joke this person is. Can't answer a straight question. Twists everything.
She got angry, yelled and threw a fit instead of crying. This was great?!!
Why you need more judges?? If you would just keep Trump policy.
Why, is Veep Harris campaigning for Donald Trump??? She seems to like Trump so much 😅😂.  All she can say is Trump Trump Trump!!!!❤😂. I have a feeling that she will vote for Trump😂
When was her border bill introduced  - 9 mos ago. She has been in office for 4 years.
Has Harris completely lost her mind? Can we see her cognitive test results?
First 5 minutes.i only have a question.?! Who’s the vice president the last 4 years? She can make the change 3 years ago. She’s a Dumb candidate
Can she answer any questions?? Deflecting, over and over again.
Why is she yelling at him?
Does Doug know about Montel ?
"Grilled"? You mean she was spoken over and treated with great disrespect! Great job Madam VP! 💙💙💙💙
What would she say if she was not allowed to say Donald Trump????
Does it look like she has Americans best interests in mind?
Who’s voting for Kamala?
Let get to the point ? Ok then answer the simple question
Was she hostile right off the bat? 😫
Why can almost no one in these comments spell BORDER? 🙄🙄🙄  Oh wait, I know. Haha idiots
Y cant she answer the questions??????????,
HOW LONG DID IT TAKE HER TO GO DOWN TO THE BORDER?
WHAT  A JOKE SHE IS CANT EVEN ANSWER QUESTION
just one time Kamala  could you answer the question asked?
So we get a bipartisan border bill that Trump kills to play politics and it's not his fault? He says he wants to be a dictator, to use the military to snuff opposition, constantly lies about every single thing that comes out of his orange McDonald's grease mouth, and its not his fault?
Does she really think peope are dumb enough to fall for all these lies? Im independent and im voting for the only president to ever dontate his presidential salary donald j trump
Can someone see if yhose earrings have a vibration which is transmitting a voice?
I wonder how any thinking American would vote for this candidate??
She’s wearing the same earrings from the debate, bug in her ear?
Why is gods name is she screaming at Brett??
how much she hiding in her nose
Does she think she can lead by bulldozing and not listening to anybody? Still no answers.
How can Harris focusing on fixing immigration when she OPENED the border
Why would the Republicans not support any bipartisan immigration bill? Put country over party.
Is it just me or she’s in love with Trump ,this for me is obsessive infatuation.She can’t stop thinking or talking about him ,I believe she’d be quiet if she doesn’t talk about him
Uh, excuse me, but putting a five point bullet plan and place for Black people only and he’s dividing the country? Just because you’re losing in the polls, you try to appeal to the black voters!
Why won’t she talk longer than 25 min?
Deflect much?! What a 🤡
in the last 16 years democrats were in power 12 years. So if they have all these amazing plans why didn’t they fix anything??
How many times did she call him a fascist? How many times did they beat him down? The enemy within is people like her and Pelosi
how much she hiding in her nose
Why are you letting her go on and on and on ?
So if I can't do my job can I tell my boss it was a person in our office over 4 years ago fault??
Why hasn’t she fixed the problem in the last 3 1/2 - 4 years!!!
Why does she talk like that, it’s like she says a few words and ends in a higher note then pauses then starts again the pauses then starts again likes she’s repeating something. I know I’m not trippin when we’d  say the pledge of allegiance in school as kids this is exactly how we’d sound
Did she convert any Trump supporters?
How can anyone watch her interviews and still vote for her?????
Who’s paying for all this? I bet it’s us the American citizens who pay taxes.
Is it just me, or does it sound like she is being fed what to say in her earring? Especially wqhen she t a lks about Iran being the biggest threat
She does not have a policy, how she is going to rule the country? How?😂
How about not letting a huge number of illegal immigrants in without knowing who they are?
Isn't she wearing the same earrings that she wore during the debate and are suspected to be an audio feed from someone feeding her answers??
Why can't she directly ANSWER any question... it's all garbage that comes out of her mouth... there is NOTHING coherent..
@18:22 was that a smoke detector beep? 🤣
How would she know about what the American people want?
The last decade? Are you serious? Four years of the Biden-Harris administration, four years of the Trump-Pence administration and two years of the Obama-Biden administration. Do you even math Madam Vice President? Sixty percent of the last decade has been Democratic administrations.
Nobody notices all these cuts?
is that straight vodka she's necking?
who did Trump lock up?
How can anybody really thinking about voting for her?
Why does she keep saying "When we are president" ? Who is we?
Does he ever let her finish a question?
Projection and deflection. They accuse the opponent of the exact same thing they’re plotting or acting on. She took a page from Pelosi’s book. Trump was already president and didn’t do any of the things they accuse him of. The questions isn’t “do they think we’re stupid?”, it’s “how stupid do they think we are?” If anyone is unstable, she’s proving it’s her.
7:00 Did nobody else notice that she was having trouble holding in her smile?! That’s sickening and disrespectful to the families of those involved! 😡
Is this the "gaslight girlboss" Gen Z is always on about??
How did that stopped bill hours after taking office help the American people…???
Why didn't Trump sign the immigration bill into law when he had the opportunity to do it? Why?
What happened with 3.5 years?
Does she not hear what she’s saying?
Where were you Kamala when they first started calling out for you to go to the border? You took your piddly old time getting there when help was needed!!! Lies, Lies, Lies!
Why is she talking louder now? 13:15  😂😂😂
Can you trust her???
I wonder what she thinks of Donald Trump?
If she has such a great plan to fix the economy, then why was the economy trash the last four years while she was in office?
What meds is she on? She is so disrespectful smh.
Does she not own any other pair of earrings?!!!
Need more judges ..maybe prevent people from Entering here will save us the need for more judges ?
Brett doesnt allow the Vice President to speak???
Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump. Cant she just answer an freakin question ? She's incompetent
Poor Kamala; she looks like she's about to cry... she's not used to real questions. Is this who we are electing as President of the United States - the most Powerful Country on planet earth?
Which question did she answer…
How rude is this guy, let her answer the question..
Who created the broken immigration system?
She was just down to the border????? 😂😂😂😂😂😂Lol
Why didn’t you shut the border down instead of letting them flood in you did that take responsibility!
When does she talk about her middle class upbringing?
DID SHE REALLY DO HER BEST WORK UNDER WILLIE BROWN? IS THAT TRUE?
Why hasn't she implemented her plan.
It was either April or October??
First he asked for a number then he goes to policy?? Whats going on
Can she answer a simple question
Sooo does she wear the same earrings every interview now?? LOL
Why do our fake gop polls show trump winning?
Why are her interviews so short? It’s like she can’t talk for more than 20 minutes
How many times did she say Donald Trump?
Are you an Independent?  REALLY an Independent?    Then vote for POLICY, not party!  Whose policy gave us low inflation, affordable energy, affordable goods, affordable housing, safer streets, and no wars?  Don't vote for either party; they're both piles of crap attacking each other.   Vote for the candidate that makes America stronger and a better place to live in.
How about human trafficking for political gain?
So why did biden sell the material for the wall?
What does that even mean?  Thats all i can say
Does Kamala own any other earrings besides the Blue Tooth pearl ones she’s worn for every interview?
not impressed with the question set.  not that they were bad, they were good in a basic way.  but the "turn the page" thing is confrontationally unecessary, the wrong track thing is not.  The Biden fit thing was good, as it shows a ridiculous answer.  Iran?  yeah that looks stupid or misinformed or nonconfrontational to the real threats.  Certainly makes Putin smile or smile at the political game answer.  It's funny that 60M made here look bla, and FOX evoked some "strong talk" from her, but for me a decided voter, she didn't make a case.  But I am also informed so she couldn't really  😉
Ive never seen anyone wear the same earrings for 2 months, is that normal ?
Does she really think we're this stupid to believe she's actually answering a question?
Why would anyone in their right mind vote for this person?
Does she realize how fking stupid she is
When he asked her how she is different and she went all over the place 😂 what are you turning the page from? Lol she couldn't even answer that!
Great questions from Bret I wish she would have answered them. Why is she so angry?
How is she running for President? Real question
Trumps unstable? What do you call someone who panders to the audience changing their accent ?
So when is Trump going on MSNBC or CNN? We all know he is too much of a coward to face ANY real journalist.
Can any person talk so much and never really say anything!
Can she just answer 1 question without including “Donald Trump”?
Is she wearing her microphone earrings again? Even if she did SHE STILL WOULD NOT ANSWER THE QUESTIONS!
This is a Question nobody has asked HARRIS - - -WHAT IS HE FOREIGN POLICY: IN REGARDS TO ISRAEL, TAIWAN VS CHINA, AND UKRAINE VS RUSSIA? If supporting Ukraine when do we stop giving money away?
Wow! Did she say anything???
❤Why does Kamala blame Trump for issues she created?
Why does she have such fancy belts etc but the same pair of pearl earrings every time
How is she blaming someone who isn’t even in a position to stop you?
Republican's supporting Her?😅 Really?
She has the same earrings? Electronic support?
Don’t ask a question if you don’t intend to listen to the answer. Was this guy raised by wolves? My Mom would have backhanded me across the room for interrupting someone like that.
Why is that coward trump not wanting a debate?
When will she answer a question?
Release the unedited interview Brett. What are you and fox news afraid of?
Why does it looks like that Kamala has more English vocabulary than Trump ? 😂🤣
What the hell was that ? Seriously.    She dodged and weaved like the next DUI arrest.
What about my small business I already have?  You going to give my money?
What in the world???😮
Still  not answering  the ??s
Can this idiot actually let her speak and stop interrupting her every two seconds? He's making a fool of himself.
Did Kamala ever bring these great ideas to Joe?
Why is she, overtalking the speaker? Very un-professional ( Woman )
Why is it when I google kamala I get pictures of hairy toes of camels, but never anything of substance or value. Isnt she like the mistress of a big company exec or something?
Can this lady answer any questions?
Your focus is fixing a problem that you made...?
How hard is it to answer yes or no question?
What are you turning the page from ? lol you are the one in there !  You make no sense ! Projecting !  Blaming !
Aren’t you going to fact check?
What? Is - exactly? “KAMALA’s- quote” professional and - life experiences”?  Cause so far- 4 years? As VP? I haven’t seen! Any of her - quote- professional experiences or life experiences! Impact anything GOOD - for 🇺🇸USA🇺🇸 Just another “Kamala word salad”!
What is 2+2? A. 4  B. 3 Kamala: well let’s cut to the chase if you really break it down it’s clear that it’s time to turn the page.
What has she done in 4 years 😂😂😂😂😂
How could anybody vote for this person.
What ARE her plans?? Anybody??
DOES LISTENING TO HER GIVE ANYONE ELSE A HEADACHE?
Can't answer the questions.  All lies
Apply for driver's license??? We don't apply in my state, we get tested
Why bring in the threats to begin with? Cough cough...
What is she talking about?? I give Brett kudos, no way I could sit there listening to her incoherent ramblings.
Can Donald Trump handle a tough interview like this one? Trump shits himself even when fox is sending him soft balls. Lol
Did she criticize the last decade? If so doesn't that include former President Obama?
How must cash did this administration give to Iran ?
Did she answer even one question?
This is a joke right!…it was a “yes” or “no” question. Let’s all be honest. Where were you for the last three years on the boarder polices??…STOP blaming everyone else! Yes, everyone wants support; so where were you??
Why wasn’t all of this worked on for the last three years then? If that is as simple as it gets then why wasn’t it implemented?
This looks like she got told to stop drinking and is 2-3 days in 😂 irritable much? 😅
God can these questions can be anymore bloated? What braindead macaque thinks "ERM... WHY DO 50% OF THE COUNTRY LIKE TRUMP?" is a good question? ☠☠☠
Why did Fox invite her on if they won't allow her to answer?  Great Job, Kamala!! You're going to be a fantastic President 💙
How's Trump loosing after this mess?!?!?
If elections mattered, would the people in power actually let us decide??? We know their viewpoints on populism.
Why does she always sound like a librarian reading a book to second graders?  No offense to librarians.
She’s So Stupid she can’t answer a simple question, How, ManyIllegals have been admitted in to  the country in the last3 1/2 years , 1, 2 , 3, ?  She can’t Imagine? Anything !
is this the full interview?
Did this idiot answer one question? What a failure of a human.
Which socialist policies do you like the most?
How does this not end her campaign?
Can u apologise for them girls deaths “yeh Im apologetic for them it shouldn’t of happened “ YOU LET IT HAPPEN AND U CALL THAT A APOLOGY🙈🙈🙈
Too bad it wasn't an hour that she promised. Who's the scared one?🇺🇸❤️🗳❤️🗳❤️🇺🇸
Can she answer 1 question without circling back to Trump?  She is pathetic!
Was he a threat during his 4 years?
How much time did she call trump name in this interview…. Genuine question
Is she on drugs? She talks like she just hit a bong trying to keep a simple thought in her head
Does she realize, when she trying to describe her administration?  It seems like shes just trying to describe what we think trump's administration will be and claim it.
And she is wearing the same earrings in every interview.  The ones that may have a mic in them.  What woman do you know who doesn't change her earrings when she changes outfits?
She can’t answer a question straight if her life depended on it.  Why is this person a presidential candidate?
Is there a video or audio file of Trump calling Service Members "suckers and losers"?  My research leads me to the same place, and that's that a number of people (no names) heard him say it once and it was printed in "The Atlantic"--a very left-leaning magazine.
Answer the question! Oh sheesh, that border bill was crap and had money going into the two current wars also, why must they include funding for unrelated wars????
What is a "scorj" - does she mean scourge? Maybe she needs "scorj" to rhyme with "bor-der".  "Border, border, border, score-j"
How many lies so far? About 20 in the last 20 minutes.
Why does she keep bringing Trump up?
Why did Fox News get slapped with over 3/4 of a billion dollar law suit and lose  ? Stop the lies and start telling the truth.
Where are the 320,000 missing immigrant children.
Was she supporting Cheree Peoples when she had her arrested and jailed for her disabled daughter missing school?
So when is transgender procedures medically necessary?
What else was in that border bill. I'll let you do the research
So if she has all these policies (80 pages worth) why the hell doesnt she talk about those instead of Trump? Especially the repeatedly debunked lies about him? My guess is because she has read them. 😏
Is this edited like the 60 minute interview?
Surely, even rusted on Democrats can see through this garbage???
Why haven't you fixed it then. It was fixed you undone it
How did she ever pass the bar exam?
Why does she act like they didnt let all these people in?
Anyone notice she was wearing the same earrings from the debate?
With 79% of the population thinking the country is on the wrong track, how can she be getting 45% or more in polls?
So, the peaceful protests during the 2020 Summer of Love?
What a bumble brain. Never answered a single question.
How is it she always wears the same earrings?  What woman wears the same earrings for every interview?
So when do you think she regretted doing this interview? I say after about 15 seconds.
The number of Mexicans coming to the US illegally has gone down. We now have a large number of South Americans, mostly Venezuelans coming here illegally, What are the policies in which the US was involved (or influenced) that impacted the political environment in South America? That is what I want to know.
Was she 5 years old, five years ago?  5 years ago, she was a US senator, with access to classified information, to make informed decisions for the American people.  Therefore was is her 5years ago excuse acceptable?
How much has she paid to take people across the state to her rallies… how much for paying influencers to speak highly of her…
Hasn't she been the Border Czar for 3.5 years????
I wonder how much she is being paid to run for the top office of the land. Im sure she is promised an insanely large amount.
I don’t think she’s all there…???
Talking loud when u get challenged, is that how u plan to deal with other world leaders?
Who has been in office, Kamala Harris or Donald Trump?
Can she ever answer a direct question?
By peaceful protest does she mean like they had in Kenosha?
Was she amphed up?
Are you not convinced yet that she is not right to lead us? What if your mom talked like that when you asked for dinner? Could you see through the nonsense then? Are you willingly blind?
How come Kamala never answer the question instead talk over the questions. Was her intentional or was she ignored the questions and don’t want to answer?
Imagine being a parent & listening to your kid not give you a straight answer. Not answer the question that you are asking but instead talking for a long time about other things or SOMEONE ELSE? This would lead you to redirect & ask the question again right? Or at least ask yourself what their intentions are or if they have the capacity to understand your question. It is insane to me that just bc she is a woman or politician or democrat or xyz that we are not holding her to the same standard that we would hold our CHILDREN regardless of their age. Politics should be black & white, yes or no, not spewed words. Sometimes it takes a long answer to allow people to understand but every single time & then not answering the question that is being asked is a huge red flag.
Why didn’t he ask about one of her plans?
Wait didn't Hillary say lock him up ??? So now he can't say it lmao
I'm so confused...is Donald Trump the current president?
Was it Trumps rhetoric dividing Americans when those who wouldn’t take the jab were ostracized, fired, ridiculed, and demonized for making their own healthcare decisions. Or nah?
I wonder why fox didn't have Harris Faulkner do this interview???  It would seem that it would have been another way that komilla's campaign couldn't use the fact that Brett was a man and that he either was 'mansplaining' things or that he was going after her because 'she was a woman'.
Why did she agree to this interview? Very odd.
Is this an interview or debate?
I wonder how much rent Trump pays to live in Harris's head?
American people???? Are you AWAKE yet?
Can she even answer a question?
Ma'am why do you lie soo much? Why do you say you are Black African American when you NOT!!!
Can she answer a question without bringing up donald trump?
is this satire???😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Peaceful protests? Like the BLM riots? Just checking Madam VP, since you fully supported those riots, err, um, peaceful protests, I mean…
Hmmm same earrings as the debate???
How did Kamala prosecute members of the Guadalajara Cartel when it was only active until 1989? She did not pass the bar exam (on her 2nd attempt) until 1990!!
How does fact check feel loll how does sound bits feel? How does push back feel? How does Follow up questions feel? How does news reporter that’s not from CNN asking questions feel? And she thought this was going to go well 😂😂😂  trump does this dance every day 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 turn the page girl! Let’s turn the page on your you!
How did she agree to have this interview????
Did i just witness another submarine implode???🤔
How can someone flap her pie hole for 20 minutes and say nothing. I take it back. She did tell about 47 lies.
Why is Bret allowing her to wear those speaker ear rings so face take them off and listen to her then
Why does Brett interrupt her so frequently? Does he want to hear the answers?
How much can you deflect and dodge serious questions
In every interview she wears the same earrings and neckless. Is someone telling her the answers?
Oh my heavens, she can't simply answer questions, wants to just bash Trump.    If she can't answer here, how can she sit down with world leader's & make sense?Scary thoughts!
this is not a conversation can she shut up while the other is talking????
“Do you want to apologize to those families?”  “Bret, I grew up next to neighbors who took pride in their lawns”.
Why didn't Brett bring up the disgraceful withdrawal of Afghanistan?
What exactly has she done ?!?! She is totally clueless.😡
What's the plan????????
Grilled??? More like  pounded flat and fried to a crisp.
Does fox news think the president is the king of everything? That seat is one branch of government, as it should be. I don't want any president to be a king of it all. That fight was won during the American Revolution.
did she ever answer the very first question?
She can't answer a question straight. She has to be one of the dumbest people I can think of with so much accomplished in her life. One must wonder how?
Is she wearing the special earrings? Hmmm
How did She get the nomination?-if Biden had full faculties?
Officer Harris.  Could you name one person of all of these supposed criminal leaders that you prosecuted as A.G?  JUST ONE NAME.
Is this a Kamala roast? 😂 What an absolute tool! 😂
So what “we” would do as President of the United States? Who is “we”??
How is a candidate who ran for president who dropped out how could her be equal to a candidate who had a great record
She's criticizing Brett for the clip he just showed? 😂  First, it was accurate; it was shown live.
Why does he keep interrupting her, while she tries to answer.
Why don’t they post the full interview? Because she did a good job and don’t want to highlight her strengths.
How much money has she spent on ads that should’ve been Biden’s
Is this the full interview?
Less than 30 minutes. Was she paid by hour like attorneys? How long does it take for her to shoot the fashion magazine?
Kamala, are you wearing your special earrings again?
How many people have resigned from working for Kamala?  Hmmm
does she only have one pair of earrings 🤫you'd think to quiet down the people saying those might be bluetooth headphones, shed wear a different set lol
Why is she getting so mad???? Like she’s got so pissed off after that live fact check😂 19:07
Did she give any yes or no responses???
I wonder why Mr. Trump is thought of by some as THE CHOSEN ONE? There is only one chosen one that I am familiar with and His name is Jesus Christ, of which Mr. Trump is total polar opposite. I'm glad that the good Lord knows all sees and hears all. May He bless all with peace and that people would try being more civil with each other.
why  am I reading  the comment section and arguing  with ppl that worship Trump  and  defend him while  putting down  his opponent, not seeing the irony ?    This is Fox News channel!  Trump's supporter are already dead set  on voting for him  and villainizing his opponents.
I wonder if one of her life experiences, that she’ll bring is being one Montel’s Hoes😂
Border was secure under Trump, why does she keep trying to blame him?
31/2 years as the border czar and now she wants to fix the border???
21:18 what experiment???? 😂😂😂😂
may I react to this video?
Why can’t she just answer a question any question ever?  She just blames Trump for everything!  She doesn’t have a clue what she’s doing!
hmm, is she wearing the same earings during the debate with trump?
Anyone notice she's wearing her special earrings again??
Why did you allow this stupid woman to continue mumbling ahead ?????
You have 26min to interview a presidential candidate and you asked them about Joe Biden’s health?? Why?
She is completely rattled over a few questions. How can someone so easily rattled be our President? Not presidential in character nor in fortitude.
And Barak Obama gave back to Iran how many billions back?????
How many times did she say "Trump"???.😂
When will MAGA think for themselves instead of having people tell them what to think?
What would she have to say if Trump wasn't involved?
What's the Indian word for liar ?
Which country in the world does Kamala Harris live in?
What about her staff? She can’t keep a staff!!! she fires or they quit right and left!!
Are those the bluetooth earrings again?
Is it possible for Kamala to be more dishonest?
Who was the brain surgeon that picked this empty pantsuit! OMG!!!
Is this woman an example for the Leader of the free world...... would America be safe under her stewardship?
Am I the only one hearing a smoke detector chirping?  No joke.
How do you ask a person a question and in the middle of an answer just cut the person off?  Then do it over and over again?  True, it's politics, they rarely give "straight answers," but still.
So will Trump be doing an interview with MSNBC?
why did she not answer the questions
She has such a silver spoon that she has no idea the difference between needs and wants?
I'd like to know how many questions she actually answered?
She certainly seems to have shared her plans with many, yet she hasn’t said what her plans are publicly? Why if it’s so great?
Why she yelling, he's just asking questions, she's getting mad
The pint is  ..1 million  ... 3  million ... 10 million?
correct me if i am wrong but the staff that claim the negative statements about trump.....werent tehy fired by trump, hence the reason they would say negative things about him?
Is that an accident that she keeps choosing those same earrings when she goes to interviews ? Just wondering
ask yourself, can you see her as leader of the free world...... negotiating with heads of state?
What about her staff? She can’t keep a staff!!! she fires or they quit right and left!!
$25,000 for a house? How'd that EV tax credit work out?
Why is half the country supporting him? Is that a serious question? The majority of Maga voters vote based off 3 things, abortion, guns, and because mommy and daddy raised them to be conservative. They have no original thought.
Is she wearing her microphone earrings?
Wasn't trump's wall supposed to fix immigration?
Can she recite just one of those polices AND how she plans to do that without putting more strain on the taxpayers
does she only have 0ne pair of Earrings................???????
How about less people being let in, rather than facilitating this invasion. Then you wouldn't need all those additional resources.
Fair and affordable housing for whom ?
Did Trump pay her to campaign for Trump?
Does Kamala ha e sinus disease, she sounds like she has nasal congestion.
Spent the better part of her career locking up  (mostly) black men,  and brown men, white men, keeping them locked up past their sentences. Was thst following the law? Was hiding evidence following the law? Convicting innocent men and hiding evidence to do so, that must of been following the law.
Sleepy Joe, where are you now? 😂
Is she going to pay for all of her pipe dreams out of her pocket?!
This made me wonder if she has read the 80 pages on her website?
18:23 was that a freakin smoke alarm?! Hahaha
Fix the problem that you created? And then blame Trump.
I thought she walked off???
Where is the record of the mystery call from Trump where he successfully killed their bill while out of office? So sick of hearing about this fake call being to blame
Inflation reduction act?
Fix the problem that you created? And then blame Trump.
What she smoking on this first question?
What the hell is she talking about?
Bret, why didn't Biden or Harris reach out to those parents immediately after their children were murdered? Why haven't they closed the border? Why is Kamala not admitting Biden was compromised? Kamala took control over this conversion. Much lighter than Trumps interview.
The simple question that never gets asked of her or Biden is “Why was Trump’s remain in Mexico policy rescinded?”
Quite hilarious! Do you think her technique of talking over people looks good, or just rude?
Why did she come to fox? It did her a disservice
She’s got 80 pages of policies but can never talk about them? Does she even know what they all are?
How can you have so much content with so little substance ?!
What the hell is she talking about???
Why do you need more border agents if you have less people coming in?  That is the question that should have been asked.
How the hell does an additional 1500 Border Patrol Agents stop 6 million flooding across?
Does she think we’re that dumb lol 😂 things have been worst since you guys took office turn page on what ? We are exhausted 😴 of you guys
When is she gonna actually let us know what her plans are othrer than give away money that we dont have anyway plus she would have to get all that through congress good luck youll need it i mean who does she think she is Bill Clinton shes not as gifted as he with the gift of gab i know BS when i hear it
Affordable housing for WHO???
What is wrong with her?  Answer the question at hand!
For God’s sake, can the woman answer a question? She’s completely vacuous…
Can she even answer a question?????? How can you vote for anyone that can’t answer a question direct!!
Why doesn't she answer the question
The Question Is: Do You Love Your Country - More Than You Hate Trump? Stop The Hate…
Can she speak off script? Holy cow. She says the same lines, verbatim, every time
Doesn't she have any other earrings?
Can she actuallly responde and not make word salad?
How is this not on top stories in the news section YouTube? Suspicious…
Do you ever notice when she talks? It sounds like she’s talking through her nose.
Are they stupid?   Shes like "I would never say that. .. ......"   but she thinks it for sure
Everytime she references her time as AG, the follow up should always be: why did you try to have a man you knew was innocent executed?
Talk about dodging questions did you all see the trump interview on 60 minutes? You know the one where he dodged the whole show?
How come you can’t handle any criticism
Wait, was this a South Park episode?
Hear is a question to ask her. If you are an American in prison and you need emergency gallbladder surgery, or eye surgery or any other surgery is the state of California going to pay for it? The answer is Hell NO!
Does she have those pearl microphone earrings on again??
What ideas? Never worked outside of a government position. Sadly she can only turn a blank page!
Medically necessary gender transition surgery?? What a joke!!
What is her plan for strengthening the economy? Asoka her a point blank question
Facts???? She never stays to the facts.
Does anybody want a president that can't take responsibility for her own a actions?
Why did 6 million shock her?
How many times was it President Trumps fault? Anyone keep count?
Why is the like button disabled? Youtube.
Sometimes I wish they would just say, "Can we have an answer that you havent already recited, Madame Vice President.... without citing your prosecutorial history (which never has anything to do with what you are asked) or hiding behind your attacks on Trump, or talking about your middle-class, childhood lawn or making french fries at McDonald's?"
Are those the blue tooth earrings again!!!!!!!1
I have a question, did Trump apologize to the families of the lives that were lost because of Jan.6? I don't like Him or Her but I have to vote for one. Honestly Trump isn't making it easy with the foolishness and Kamala with the Homosexual agenda
Where are the facts ? I still don’t have a dam clue what this administration has planned!!
Do any of you know how government works? The senate is always 50 50 and has anyone heard of the legislative filibuster?
Why did she give a salad when Brett had asked for a number?
Who was the dummy who chose Brett hair for this?
Why is he letting her run the interview..... 🙄
Why did you allow her to wear those earrings?
Clear? Foggy is all
How madam VP can you expect to fix the Immigration issue by cancelling what the previous President had going that was strengthening the border in the first place? The logic does not hold at all!!
When you vote, ask yourself:  Do you want the Great Reset?  Or  Do you want an Independent United States of America?  Vote Trump for the latter.
How much wine did she have pre interview?
Q:  Do you owe these victims an apology? This $XAI895T is actually lit
Why would she get rid of the filibuster when she is so good at it? Answer the freaking question!
Was she sniffing paint or gasoline before the interview🤔
If you watch this and still plan to vote for Kamala I just have one question for you. What's your favorite flavor of crayons?
What you do for Americans  people  Kamala?
More Bluetooth earrings 😅 🎤 ?
Why does Bret keep interrupting the future POTUS?!
Where is her ethnic accents? Where are the cackles? I’m still waiting for her middle class fable…maybe I’m too early?
How does he have no plan when you can’t even answer a single question honestly. This lying skin walker can’t not be president
I would hate to see how she handles priorities in her house?
She had ; years and why didn’t she fix it????
What is her plan? I’m still waiting to hear it!!
What is your favorite restaurant?  Well, Donald trump…
Why is he interrupting? He is trying to trap her. But she is strong! 💪
Plans what are they???????
Can she at the very least apologize for causing the tragedies? !
Why isn't she laughing like she usually does during these interviews?
Where has your plan been in the last 4 years ?
How come nobody is talking about why the bill was killed? It because all the PORK in the bill the democrats where trying to pass in the bill. Thank God the Republicans killed the bill.
It’s not supposed to be easy, well how did you get here?
How many? Still won’t say how many!
Lies,  lies, lies.  Why is she so angry?  Oh right REAL questions. hope more believe and understand $XAI895T after all
Q:  How many illegal immigrants have entered the US under your administration? how long is $XAI895T rdy for us?
She literally is incapable of answering a question without talking about Trump. She's got major TDS. how long is $XAI895T opened to us?
Why does she change her accent every time she talks?
Why can’t two people speak to each other without any childish antics? I miss the 90’s.
How is it possible that this person is somehow a candidate for President of the United States? 🤣
Is this our life like really..is this the best America has to offer..all these brilliant minds here and this is what we get
It’s absolutely mind blowing how they can repeatedly call Trump divisive whilst calling him a threat to democracy, an existential threat, a Putin puppet, a danger to America but apparently that language isn’t divisive? How do they not see the contradiction and why aren’t they called out on it constantly? Anything good they have done but anything bad it’s still Trumps fault. Crazy.
Does she even hear herself?!?! Why are you yelling?? We can hear you. You don’t need to scream. Stop deflecting and blaming someone else for your own shortcomings. You should be ashamed of yourself Madame Vice President.
Is Fox doing their Job ??
Ignorance?? Maybe?? Just maybe…
Can she answer any question without talking about Donald Trump?
The last decade? Hmmm.....let's see. During the last decade Obama was POTUS for 8 years. Trump for 4 years and Biden for 3.5 years. The math makes no sense. She's a weasel.
How many? She will not give us a number!
Did she say Biden was an experiment? 🔬
Q:  Why do 79% of Americans think the country is on the wrong track? bring the heat with $XAI895T we gonna have a huge year btw
If the immigration system is so broken why is an anchor baby the VP and up to be the American President?? Why are there so many foreigners in government yet there are no pathways??
How’s that wall coming along that Trump promised voters?Mexico was going to pay for it too.
If i could ask her one question it would be "How do you feel being a puppet?" That arrogance of hers, could you imagine the look she'd give you ..
Can she answer a question without mentioning Donald Trump?
Answer his question????    Did you and Biden undo Trumps policies or not???   More word salad...    Diverge from the topic and get lost from what she was asked
Are those the same Earings???
What f'ing planet is she living on.
Madam Vice President what did you have for breakfast this morning?  Harris - "Donald Trump"
Why does she slakways blame Trump?
If Donald Trump wants so bad to deport immigrants will he also deport his wife and in-laws who he petitioned for to get her original visa, will he also stop using immigration labor to work his hotels and resorts? I can assure you his maids, cooks , groundskeepers and other laborers are not natural born Americans.
Does this woman not have another pair of earrings!!!
Does she ever answer the question?  All I hear is projection and hypocrisy from our Vice President.
Does it Even Matter Anymore?? She WILL NEVER ANSWER THE QUESTION TRUTHFULLY OR AT ALL!! with XAI895T arriving the best is yet to come, you could know that!
When Kamala Harris points her finger it shows her frustration with the question
That was hard to watch. She failed this hard and now want to go on Rogan?!?!?! He's going to eat her alive and wont just move on when she refuses to answer a simple question. I can't wait
Brett, Brett, Brett, The question " When in your mind did it become a crisis?"  Harris on the view " Nothing comes to mind "... I think I get why I can't stand her.... It's that pleading, whiney voice that comes through her nose...It just doesn't instill confidence, and I don't think Putin would listen to that either.
I wonder is she's serving croutons with that salad? Geez!
Some of you think she is qualified for President? God help the US.
How does Kamala Harris sleep at night with all her lies? Despicable.
Why doesn't she answer any questions directly?
If an IQ under 80 means you’re mentally deficient, why can’t we bar those people from voting? Kamala would get ZERO votes and the country would do SOOOO much better! Let’s make it so you have to pass a civics test to vote!
She cant answer if she's going to spend tax dollars on trans surgery for prisoners? How is she running for president and cant answer this question?
Joe Biden has mumbled and bumbled progressively worse to the point of incoherence by the American people and VP Harris, why didn't you say anything 1, 2, or 3 years ago? You put us all in serious jeopardy.
How is she going to pay for it
So where do I go to see Trump's proposed policies??????
What has she intended to do these past 4years????
Dear G_d, does Brett want to talk all the way through the time allowed? Is he going to let her finish a point, a thought? She is speaking and a good interviewer let's the other person talk without constant interruptions.
Who made them wrap up so suddenly…. Fox media or was it her administration trying to get her to stop talking
How many times does she say rederick?  Good lord, I don’t think if she couldn’t say Donald Trump she wouldn’t be able to talk!
something sinister is happening. How in the world she ended up here? People didn't even wanted her for VP
Who told her it was smart to go to Fox News and how did you convince her she could handle it after multiple softballll interviews? 🤣🤣🤣
Why has 92% of your staff quit after saying they can't take your abuse any more!!!
Smoke detector chirp 18:22?
She can’t answer ONE single QUESTION…yes.. these women among hundreds of others were killed and all you can say is.. I am sorry for their loss?!?!
No the point is you are not answering the question; are you just dumb or deaf?  Answer the question!
Did you notice she is wearing those same earrings from the debate.
Will there be a peaceful transition of power if Trump wins?
How come no one talks about what else was a part of the Border $118 billion dollar bill, like $60 billion to Ukraine and $14 Billion for Israel and who knows what else. Only a small portion was going to the Border issue.
How is everything trumps fault? Take some ownership. She’s so fake
So they broke it completely trying to fix it?  Now we know not to allow them to “fix” anything.
Why won't Mike Pence endorse Trump?
You know how a dog hollers when you’re beating it for what it did on the floor?! That’s how she acts or rather reacts to questions!
What’re they going to blame once Trump is dead and gone? 😂
Was she doing a Nancy Pelosi impression after the 16 minute mark? Hand movements and everything.
Last decade???  2014, 2015, 2016 Obama 17, 18, 19, 20 Trump 21, 22, 23, 24 Biden Seems to me the Democrats have been in office the majority of the decade.
What about going after the 20 million illegal immigrants you allowed into this country shouldn't you be prosecuted?
Did this |{amel hump her way to the t○p? She is disgusting.
When is anybody going to address that she's wearing the exact same earrings does she wore on the debate and every single interview that she does has the same earrings. Ladies do you wear the exact same earrings all the time??
"Turn the page"? How's she gonna turn the page when between every sentence she defaults to slam Trump. "Like leaders of the intelligence community"? Did that include the 51 who signed off on the scam of the week?
Q:  Do you owe these victims an apology? wanna know more about XAI895T too dude
She looks too weak, how can she talk to other countries? We have to be wise about our election
How many lies can she tell?
Why does she keep wearing the same earrings? ... That's very odd.
Q:  Why do 79% of Americans think the country is on the wrong track? you guys rly should take part in XAI895T at this point
No wicket laugh 😆 with the folks from Fox ?
Can any Kamala supporter here tell me the best response she gave without mentioning "Trump"?
What the hell is this? 😂🎉😂🎉
Q:  How many illegal immigrants have entered the US under your administration? wanna know more about XAI895T too bro
Did she have an earpiece? She couldn’t possibly have any “facts” in her head.
Word salad is not a plan! Who's going to pay for your Christmas Tree of FREEBIES??? The top 1% of income earners already pay 43% of all taxes collected...paying more than their "FAIR" Share!!! They will pack up and leave with their money! Your handouts only happen if they can fit an extremely narrow window or they start a business that makes more than $50k first in order to get a deduction!
What does the Iranian culture think of a woman leader?
How come nobody ever asks her or biden why they changed the policies? Explain THAT to us and the parents of victims? How was changing trumps policies n catch a release a good thing for the country?? Make them answer those questions. And ask the reason why they did it....period. instead if these stupid games trying to get a sound bite of her apologizing.
Grilled? Roasted is a better word!
This was so hard to watch. I have a genuine question for anybody who is going to vote for Kamala. Without bringing up Donald Trump, why are you supporting her?
Why did DoD Directive 5240.1 just get amended on 9/27/2024 to allow the military to use LETHAL force on Americans  while assisting local law enforcement during times of civil unrest???
Isn't Fox Entertainment the one that got sued for a billion dollars for lying?
Did she really do this interview to not answer a single question?
If the immigration system is so bad, then why didn't Trump and some Republicans support the Immigration Bill?
Tightening up the border.. penalize those who break legal crossing...when!!!!!??? whose the liar?
Anyone else enjoy watching her crumble as much as I do? I might enjoy it a little too much 😅.  Trump 2024
I wonder if she has read her own policies yet? What a joke!
Did she even answer 1 question ?
She got ideas??? Yet she can't talk.without a teleprompter
How was it fox fans? A real interview that was coherent and not sundown at the nursing home.
Only 26 minutes? I thought this was gonna be at least an hour? Nah I'm not conviced.
Kamala: How can i say lot's of words without saying anything? Twump did it i pwomise c'mon mon.
Fentanyl is pronounced FENT-IN-ILL. Why do people struggle so hard with this simple world?
So Kamala did you not notice in 3.5 years concerns about Joes cognitive abilities?   Well I do know the American people have concerns about Donald Trump.  Nice Kamala, nice 👍
What does he keep talking over her? What a loser!!
How you don't interrupt someone who talks for 45 minutes without saying anything and without getting to the point?
Did she answer any of Bret's questions?
Has she been drinking?  Sounds like she's going to cry?!?!  What a liar and a loser!!
How many times can one person say the word "clear" in 25 minutes?
Where is the interview ..it’s disappeared
Has anyone noticed her earrings? Aren’t they the same o es she wore during the debate?
What an idiot. Deflects every serious question.
She undid 99 of Trump’s executive orders on immigration. Why?
Is she the future for the U.S. what do you think? Would love to hear. Thx.
Are you kidding me Joe is more stable than Trump I never saw Trump fall up the stairs
How much border could a border bill build if a border bill could build borders?
Wow. Does anyone fall for her? 😂
Does Trump owe the Capital Police officers and their families an apology?? Hhhhmmmmm???
why did she not attend congress when israel president was in washington? if she cares so much about israel
Am I the only one that noticed she is shaking her head in a "no" motion while saying "I'm so sorry for their loss"? We all know what that means. Based on signs and body language experts, when you answer "yes" or in her case "sorry for their loss" but you move your head in a "no" motion, the movement is actually what tells the true and not the words. She is changing the head movement into a "yes" motion when she continues saying "sincerely". So, she sincerely confirms that she's not sorry. We can all see her true feelings about the illegal immigrants released in USA that committed those crimes. She doesn't care.
And are they plagiarized?
Omg are you going to use tax payer money to give plastic surgery to trans inmates or not??!!!
Do you even know what the 80 pages on your website say?
Why is she so angry? Someone give her a blood pressure pill. 😂
When she made her claims about trump, I would have said "oh yea, like what for example?"
Has she answered any of the questions 🤔🤔
Why interview her if you wont allow her to speak?
How bad is ,la’s internal polling that she felt she needed to sit down with Brett?
where is david muir to help kamala??? ..... :-)
Just have to ask Bret, what that the most annoying interview you've done?
Why is she so mad?😂😂😂
Does anyone know what she is talking about???
Why would she even do this interview?  Desperation is a stinky cologne.
Is that womansplaninng ?
She is so hard to watch and listen to - just agitated the whole time. When she will sit with tough world leaders- does she think she can just wave her hand and shut down conversations in an agitated way? She is not diplomatic - Not very presidential. Very dissapointing.
Why isn't Fox uploading the unedited version? Why are there so many cut scenes?   I want to hear what she actually said, not what Fox wants the sheep to see.
Did she just rage quit at the last moment ?🤣
Does she wear the same earrings everyday?.... just wondering.
Elegy did Harris & Biden rescind Trumps policies?  Why did they sell the remaining wall material for Penny’s on the dollar.
Will she ever just answer a question?
Past 10 years? 6 of them were under Obama/Biden and Biden/Harris. Sense a trend?
Why is sheeheee defensive😂
Can she even say anything true?
What’s her plan on all this?  I’ve never heard it…. She’s very clear
21:55 the question was, regarding BIDEN, you didn't have any concerns VP Kamala?  ...the answer never came.   Just more pointing fingers at the scapegoat 👉 "Trump". 👈
Is this really comedy central???
what has she been doing all these years? since she has soooo many plans now ?
How is posible was kamala vp for four years 👎🏽
Why hasn’t she done all that’s she’s going on about.
Can we have interviews where she is not allowed to mention Trump? Just talk about her policies and address issues that affect the American people!
He asked Kamala, if that's the case, why is half the country supporting Donald Trump? He does realize that half of the country has an education of a high school diploma or less, right? Those are the people who are overwhelmingly supporting Donald Trump.
Why does she always wear microphone earrings and the same outfits in different different colors like men's suits
Has she never seen special report? This was awful for her. Somebody messed up.
So...when is trump going to let himself be interviewed by Rachel Maddow?  Turnabout is fair play...
When someone asks you a question, they KNOW what the point of their question is. 🙄
Is she wearing the same earrings she wore at the debate??
Does she hear herself……thank God she doesn’t point fingers or call names about Trump or his supporters. That’s all she talks about.
Why does she always wear microphone earrings and the same outfits in different different colors like men's suits
Why does she always wear those earrings?
So Kamala, just what is your plans??? More deflections, less truth! That is what I hear coming from you.😞
If her plans are so great why is our country so broken under her watch?
Why 50% Americans are stupid to believe her? It's a curious case for R&D.
Does she even have an  answer or is it marxist double talk
Why is Brett debating Isn’t it supposed to be an interview?
How about the "WALL" construction that was aborted ...or wait .. Kommie...you guys like abortion.
Why didn’t you answer those question!
Did anyone notice that she wore those earrings that she wore during the debate with Donald Trump?
why was Biden thrown under the bus
Where was she in the last 10 years????
Woooow!  Now what???? After we heard all of this.... what now?
So the BLM "Protests" that cost this country Billions of Dollars were Peaceful??
Kamla Harris doesn't even seems like a real person. Why does everything that she says seems like a made up?  Why she feels like a clown dude?
@6:55 did anyone see a slight smirk when she’s “apologizing”?
How many times did she mention Trump? 😂
Why put a time limit on something so important? This is why podcasts are winning.
Why does Fox News have Bret Baier on their payroll? He's insufferable as an interviewer.
Do normal interviews just play random clips mid talking? Usually its a conversation. This thing was 30 minues, half it was clips?
I had to search for this interview. Why was it so hard to find it?
9 months or in 2021? Which is it?
can someone please ask her how many people she has actually prosecuted? other than weed smokers. lol
Can she just follow the laws that are currently on the books??
This is so hard to watch she is so bad. Does she even answer a question or does she dodge very one?
24:05 Why is she talking like this? It's so unnatural.
She keeps talking about rhetoric...has she listened to herself and all her comrades? Disgusting! Atleast there's receipts with what Trump calls out. Honestly, listening to her just makes me sick.
13:37 trump doesn't understand economics??
What in the actually what actually like what was what is still what it was when it was what it were what???
Why is she wasting time repeating the question?!  Using up time. I can hardly listen to her
Who's dropped more boxers, Mohammed Ali or Kamala Harris?
Do you support transitioning men to transgender operations paid by taxpayers for prisoners Kamala?
I wonder what she done. She’s going to jail. I see the guilt all in her face.
Can she whine just a little more?
Taxpayers paying for prison inmate surgery?   Why?  They r criminals...sick
Divisiveness? Rhetoric?  Your party tried to send him to prison multiple times and wannabe assassin's were trying to get to him.!!!! Harris you barely can grip reality 😂.
Does Baier not see or understand that Harris is using him to downplay Trump with no facts.
What is with the earrings?  Does she not own any other pairs of earrings?  Or is there something special about these earrings.
Why can't she answer one question?  She is avoiding direct questions.   God help us  if she is elected!
How come I didn't get a notification that this video exists .
Bret, that's not me in those adds, that's a look alike., DI I DO THAT?
Biden is  not running? The question was why did you lie about joes cognitive state
How and what will yoh do specifically, Ms. Harris?
Why did they end the interview?
How about answering the questions you low IQ mongrel...
It's my understanding that by reducing the taxes, even of the top 1%, has a trickle down effect. The wealthy spend a lot of money, create businesses and in turn, more jobs and opportunities for lower classes. Am I wrong?
Why wont she do a debate on fox.
Did anyone learn anything about her policies?  I mean what is going to be different when she is installed, ummm I mean elected.
Does anyone else notice she's still wearing the ear rings that everyone's said have speakers and she's getting talking points?
Can we get an answer a question without speaking about TRUMP
Did anyone learn anything about her policies?  I mean what is going to be different when she is installed, ummm I mean elected.
So Trump had that much power when he was out of office? Imagine what he can do while in office!
I hope Brett ask her about his mental acuity and how long did she know he was not fit.?
How are you on the ballet😮
Why doesn't anyone talk about how inhumane trumps border policy was? Seperating parents either children and the ostrasization of immigrants.
Why do they need to cut it off so short?
Turning a page from the last decade? Is that a low blow to Obama/biden administration because biden and you were the other part of that decade of hell you have put in America.
Didn’t she have four years to fix all these problems?
What about the policies that secured the boarder to begin with that she overturned? It was secure. Why not leave that until they could pass something else?
What did she ever do to stop fentanyl coming in???
Is it just me, but her face turned gray! All she does is blame without accountability!
Answer the questions?
why she did nothing to improve economy ?
Do I see those bluetooth earrings?  🤣  She can't even answer a question with assistance!  STOP blaming Trump... 😱
What was the outcome of those prosecutions?  wanna bet some cartel billions are redirected?
What has this woman done in the last 4 years????
What’s your economic policies???
We want you to answer the question, what's with the filibuster??
Is this really 26min??? God i hate to listen to this bimbo! It's not really her that pisses me off it's the people that support her!
How many wars were started under Trumps administration? 000000000
Did she answer any direct question?
Wasn't she the Border Czar or something?
Trump wants to turn the military against the American people??!! He should have called her out on DoD Directive 5240.01 that was JUST signed that would authorize military action against US citizens. Trump has never said he would use the military against us, yet it's in writing that current administration is.
WHY did you STOP Remain in Mexico?? THAT is the f'ing question!!
Yall saying all she talks about is trump... have you listened to him??? He's never not a single time talked about policy. I've watched every rally and townhall. He has never talked about policies or how he will do anything
How can anyone give this person any support? Why would you vote for this person? Stop being SHEOPLE!
When Harris says we have fixes to fix the border, start asking giving what fixes specifically.
Was this SNL.
If she has done a good job for 4 years and left a hope to improve why border patrol union endorsed Donald Trump not her?
Where is Trump?   playing golf
If the border security wanted support, she was in office for 3 1/2 years. Why didn’t she give it to them? They were very smart to back Trump!
Wow! That woman should rot in hell for all the lying she does! Her only action is to lie repeatedly when she can not and will not answer a question. Does she know that lying is a sin?
how does it fell Honey, the shoe on the other foot!!????
how many immigrants were involved in Jan. 6?
What did you do for 4 years 😅😅😅😅😅😂😂
She has to be from another planet! Where does she get that crap?
She won't answer the fu:#3+ questions.. wow ?? 🤯
How can she have become DA when she didn't pass the bar exam??
Can she answer a single question please?
Trump was only in office 4 years, why go back to ten years?
The past decade? Dems have been in power 12 out of the past 16 years
Is she wearing the same earrings that will broadcast answers to her?
IS SHE LIKE A CAR SALES PERSON. LET ME KNOW.❤
Why did Bret not question her blatant plagiarism?
She wears the exact same earrings all the time. Someone perhaps whispering in her ear? Huh?
Turn the page? Dems have been President for 12 of the last 16 years. 25% of that time had Comma-la in the white house.
Why does she think she is in a debate.  This is a simple, i ask a question, u give an answer....maybe because she really doesnt have ANY answers!
What are those new ideas??
WHAT THE FUK is the plan!?! It's a simple question. Every non relevant person seems to know of this "plan".  Again what the FUK is the plan!!!???!!!
Burdened by rhetoric? Does she really believes what she’s saying?
What's your policies mam? Answer;  Goto my website and read my 80 pages and interpret them how you see fit. I don't have time to explain my positions. 🤣🤣🤣
Is this just a Trump bashing interview?
Can she actually answer a question that is asked? Dip n' dodge...  geez...
When will Trump go on MSNBC? Or is he too afraid? Many of the liberal outlets have invited him but he turned them down because he is a weak coward. He had an interview scheduled with CNBC and turned it down last minute this week.
If shes so sorry THEN WHY DIDNT SHE DO ANYTHING STILL?
Kamala are you on your period or your on birth control??
Why is it so hard for her to apologize?
she doesn't go anywhere without those earrings does she?
She is rude and won't answer the question.  She is aggressive and angry.  Does her earrings not work tonight?
Is she brain dead ? She never answers questions ! 😂
Is she reading a teleprompter again??
When is someone going to scramble her pearl earring Bluetooth speakers?
WHEN WILL SOMEONE CALL HER OUT ON ALL THE LIES?????? WHEN!!!!!!!!!!! HE WAS TOO NICE
If USA does not have  a  way  to obtain background information to those illegal migrant, how Harris ‘ catch and release’ policy can keep criminals out of our country even she has more judges and patrols?
The question I want asked: Oh Joe Biden is sharp is he? Joe Biden won the Democratic primary. So why are you here?
Is this an interview? This is a butcher job. This guy has no interest in any actual interview. I guess they told him try you best to confuse her and make her look as bad as you can. It's a shame..the tactics they have to pull out..
Is this the face of the new generation  leadership ?I just don't know what you talking about.
whats the matter Kackles your getting very loud and angry???? lmao
Was that water in that glass ??? 🤣😂🤣
How many times did she say "Trump" during the interview?
What about the white immigration oppression? When Italians, German, Scotish, Irish, and other from the "Eastern" made their way to our shore and were greeted with slurs LIKE: WOP (With Out Papers) Daigo, Ginny, Kraut, potato, Mick, and the other creative names.
Did she not live her High School years in Canada and then not even register to be an American voter until her late 20’s almost 30 ?
And the DNC thought this would win her votes??? Wow.
That was painful, WHY DOES SHE TALK?
She going to bring her life experiences????  I don't want to have to learn to give head to move up in the world!!!!!!
Why was she late to the interview if not to milk the time knowing she will be grilled with tough questions.
How can fox do this? Isn't it just... entertainment? Oh right, it is!
5 minutes in...is this gonna be all 'gotch questions'? Perdue Pharma put opioids in the hands of millions of Americans AND millions DIED and none of those rich people are in prison but their skin isn't brown, it's white...lily white.
Don't you answer the question you're not answering the questions none of them,
Lie, lie lie dose she even know what the truth is?
What about the black people that don’t have internet and don’t know how to use it? How can they see your policy? Considering they’re apparently too slow to get ID for voting.
you've been to Europe also right? 😊
Turn the page on divisiveness??  😂😂😂 you all wrote the book on divisiveness!!!  Typical Marxist!
Turn the page on divisiveness??  😂😂😂 you all wrote the book on divisiveness!!!  Typical Marxist!
Why does Brett ask questions if he doesn’t want to hear the answer or just keeps interrupting while she’s answering?!? They’re all Trump’s minions lol
Did her nose just grow a little longer??
Why can’t she just answer the question????
Wait, so 6 democrats actually killed this "border bill" but she continues to blame Trump? She lies and plays blame games so much. Bringing up the debunked suckers and losers. 🙄 She's clueless!
So what’s your plan ? Still no answers
how do you shake your head no while saying sincerely?
Who did the border patrol union endorse?
Why is she giving so much money to Iran.
How the f*ck was she prosecutor?
How the heck is letting millions of people, who knows what background they have! Fixing the border?
Why did she start panicking when the topic of Iran, oil and enrichment were brought up?
Who would vote for her?? What a mess she is.
Does she only own 1 pair of earrings? Only ever seen her wearing the "Tiffany Pearl Earrings". I dont know a single women that would wear the same pair 2 days in a row let alone only a single pair always, unless thay are actually ear phones.
Who is currently vice president Kamala?
If you invite someone to an interview why not allow them to speak? You asking questions and not giving the interviewee the respect to respond.
Is she forgetting what happened with the Afghanistan withdrawal
She was down at the border talking to border agents? You mean the same border agents whose union backed Donald Trump? Lol😂😂😂 meanwhile it was the IRS the backed her how communistic can we get?
If she can't handle a single reporter, how will she fare in arguments with Presidents Xi and Putin?
How many people did Donald trump use on the US citizens from 2016 to 2020?... 0... why is the opposite what the leftists believe? They are a danger to truth.
Didn't the DOD just change their ability to use lethal force on citizens,?
What is she today Indian black Jamaican?
Too bad he can't act on a Trump, though. Question why he made those people starting to capital? Why is he still talking to Putin? He won't ask Trump that. Yeah, fox probably got the news.
she has a LOT of solutions but why she haven't done it?
Hey Bret, would you and your colleagues like to apologise to the American people for deliberately spreading misinformation and defamatory remarks resulting in a $787 million defamation lawsuit against FOX "News"??  The biggest defamation lawsuit in US history, with more to come, btw.
Is delusion an art form now?
Is this the full interview?
Why do you have the greatest turnover of staff then any Vice President has ever had?
Who has she lifted up as a president?
Boarder secutity bill was 9 months ago but what happened for the first 3 years? How maney illeagls entered in the US for the first 3 years? Why they were waiting until 9 months ago! oh, i get it, because the elections and they want it to saw you how GOOD they are....
“When did you first notice Joe Biden’s faculties appeared diminished?”  Excellent question, useless answer.
Anyone else notice she wore the same pearl “earrings” on all 4 interviews?
9:45 you havent decriminalized border crossings? Cause from what i can see the past 4 years its completely legal to cross the border. No reprocussions in fact you made an app to make it easier!
Don't you have to run on a problem to fix a problem. Kamala Harris is one of the biggest problems.
How many times did she say Donald Trump?
WHO IS THE MEDIA???????    FOXNews the spin network???  The problem today is there are 1000's of media sources...and the public doesn't know what to believe...Sensationalism (especially in journalism) the use of exciting or shocking stories or language at the expense of accuracy, in order to provoke public interest or excitement, ratings and money…well done FOX Fools! YOU make the money and LIKES… Maybe it pays for the 787 million dollars for lying to there viewers...who do you believe?
I want to know where the money is coming from to pay for this free money for housing, business.?
What about all your staffers who quit, and quit,  and quit,  ma'am? 22:27
When questioned about her time in power, actions and inaction she's always flips everything back about Trump.   She cannot have the focus be about her time in office.
Why is she yelling?
can someone please tell me how any AMERICAN can vote for that pathetic person who puts the illegal immigrants before us????
How could anyone with a brain vote for her
Joe Biden has talked about enemy within since day one!! Kamala, why is it okay for Dems to talk about the enemy within but not Republicans??
Did she even prep for this interview?
Ask yourself how would Trump handle the Israel, Hamas and hezbola conflict?  How would he deal with Russia and Ukraine?  Think about that exactly what would Trump do and how would he deal with NATO and the World Health Organization!  People really need to think outside all the BS rhetoric and what what’s really gonna happen if Trump gets in the office just think about what the hell is he going to do?
was it just me or was she about to cry when posed with the first question. I heard her voice break and was waiting on the waterworks. hilarious...
Does she not realize she is the evil within?
Why wasn't she laughing a lot
This interview is more like DEBATE questions BUT trump is missing from this debate. Where’s trump?
Did she loose her temper?
What kind of women have you ever met who wears the same ear rings all the time.
They supported the guy that killed the border bill & never actually offered a bill when he was the President ?????
Has Brett been arrested yet? He just killed and buried her on national television
Will trump go on MSNBC for an interview....asking the MAGA minions out there 🤷🏾‍♂️.
How many times did she mention trump ?
What exactly is your plan?
How many times did she say Donald Trump? 🙄 🤮
WTH was that? She never answered anything clearly.
When's Trump going on MSNBC? When will he release his health records? Income taxes? ANY policies?
Does she not know they’ve been trying to lock him up for 4 years now, give me a break
Are these really Bots? Or are people paid to comment here? It is mind blowing.
Hmmm Congress has a role in law making?  WOW! 🍻
Why in the heck not let her talk? Why overtalk her and interrupt?
Why isn’t the quest how do you justify ripping up the remain in Mexico policy?
How is using TAX PAYER’s money for funding prison surgeries not a concern for a voter.
Did she suck helium at some point during this interview??? 😂😂😂
If Kamala can fix it, why is it still broken nearly four years after she took office?
What do we say when Dear Leader shits himself? Thank you sir may we please have another! We are maggots !
Serious question for you Trump supporters: What is it that you like about Trump?
Why is she allowed to speak lies?
What are you turning the page from??? 😂😂😂
Why is it only France and the United States have broken immigration systems 🤔
Why was it only 27 min? I was enjoying the smell of grilled Kamala.
Then why are you paying them to be here? Ask that question Brett
How many times does she have to look to the sidelines for some one to call a *time out* ?
What a joke she is!!!! She has not a clue!! Point is he asked a question!!!!!
no mention of trump routinely shitting himself?
Nice over talk her Geeze how can she answer a question?
Answer a question? The queen of deflection
Why would anyone vote for her? Talk to her about the millions of lazy criminal Venezuelans that she and Biden have let in .
WHY DOES SHE TALK?
@00:36 wow.. she immediately starts filibustering, he attempts to REDIRECT her then SHE blames HIM for interrupting…?
Does this cow ever take those pearl earrings off or are they microphones?
Turn the page on rhetoric? This country is in shambles, and that's the only thing she can pledge to turn the page on. Wild!
Why didn't Trump fix the country when he was president? I'm still waiting on his healthcare plan he promised.
Why won't she answer a simple question rather that diverting and lying.
Did Trump get Mexico to pay for the WALL?
She just kept rambling on , now who saw that only one of her ears was uncovered Hum , was she wearing an ear piece in again? Think 🤔
Does she actually ever answer a question?
Are her magic earrings not working tonight?
Does she actually think shes comes off looking good in this?
Baier: "What would you do differently than Biden?"
Baier: "How will you fix the Israel and Palestinian crisis?"
So, Ma'am, why is the border still a major, perhaps number one, problem?
What the hell is wrong with her!!!!!????
Kamala do you recall Kate Steinly?
Was it only 27 minutes?   Or is there a full interview somewhere.. Thanks
If the immigration system was broken, why wasn't there an invasion until after they arrived at the White House?
Democracy??? América is run by military complex and it's puppets biden adm and democratic party and kamala lets take our country from military complex and we the people are all voting for trump
So how you can fix it???
Why is it that this crazy lady can't seem to answer one simple question? Is she mentally unstable or just ignorant? 😂😂😂😂😂
Has Fox redemption come?? Bret made a national stooge out of her..
Those same earrings as every interview 😂😂😂 Isn’t there any money left in the secret projects fund to make her a new pair of earphone earrings? Fk me ✋😂
How many times did she mention Trump in this interview? She literally can't do an interview without mentioning him at least 15 times, its exhausting to hear...
Straight forward question - “How many? “  Answer- “To the point” , but couldn’t give a number !
How many members of Kamala Harris's staff resigned from prestigious White House assignments working with her?
Theres republicans supporting her? Lol
Kamala...did Doughie sleep with the nanny? Did he also slap the nanny?
Can you not answer a straight question?
How terrible... It's like every answer she gave? Had that upward lilt of questioning? Like she wasn't sure of her words? That's a linguistic tell? Of a person looking for validation of their words?  Good job Brett. You must be exhausted from watching her dance around all your questions.
You really want this salty woman for the president?
So Kamala…. no apology to the families?   Wow.
So are all her policies for black men only according to her promises to the black men voters? She is more rhetoric left Democratic policies and  inexperienced fake person. She too will be a puppet and Obama will be her puppeteer!
What if Kamala is only fed ai videos of Trump and actually believes herself 😂
Is she wearing the same ears that she had worn at the debate? Just asking
did she answer one question ?
So she spending millions of tax dollars so others may have a house. What about us with a house that needs home repairs and maintenance updates?! When do we get $25,OOO???
How exactly is the border broke, if you don't follow the law?
21:03  absolutely love this question...if trump is unfit then Biden is what?!
Anyone know if this was "doctored"? I didn't get a chance to see this live.
Why's she raising her voice?
Is there someone more stupid and incompetent than she is?!
How many illegal immigrants would you estimate that your administration released into the country over the last three years!
Why can’t she not grasp the reality of her horrible actions?
Which earrings is she wearing during this "interview"??
DJT is not in office!!!! Why does she keep saying his name?!?!
Let her friggen answer the question.  Does he want to ask questions or just do a monologue?
I appreciate what Bret did here, but I don't understand why he didn't call out her blatant lies about President Trump supposedly wanting to turn the military on American citizens and so forth? All of that was a blatant lie and he didn't call it out.
Why she is wearing the same ear ring every time she had real interview??
She's amazing! Where have they been hiding her? I may just change my vote.
Why isn’t this live???
She can't answer a single question. When was border concern? No answer, right into sales and fingerpoint
Lol they do the same to jd vance by interrupting now all of a sudden fox does it its a problem?
Why doesn't Brett SHUT UP! He's talking OVER HER every minute.
Wow...is this episode of Punk'd? This can't be real nominee for the President of the USA ..
Brett, why you  didn’t tell her to stop lying and talking about Trump, when you are asking about her policies?? Also, why couldn’t you ask her to be more respectful to you!!?? Who is going to tell her that people don’t like her because of her attitude and theatrical style!!
They need more judges to process them, why can't they do it in mexico not here?
Does she own any other earings??
Why did she get soo angry? what a bad look
You American's seriously considering this 'word salad' mess as a President? Ahahaha!
Why if she’s so concerned about Iran are the insisting Israel’s support be minimal and they’re to be the peacekeepers when in fact they’re still under constant attack???
Why was she in the situation room?
Why do an interview on a Network that paid $800 million lawsuit for lying about an election? Their viewership are in a cult.
Where have those fresh new ideas been over the last four years?
Have any of you watch the trump bloomberg interview, or are you just blind to what you don’t want to see???
Did she even answer one question he asked?
Is that person supposed to protect the American population from an invasion or a war????? She'll lie and lie and lie .
Why so hostile?what happened to the joy 😂😂😂😂😂
Who is locking people up!?!?!?
Is it just me, or does she seem to be wearing the same pair of earrings at every interviews just as she was waering at the presidential debate? I notice that she wore some other pair at her rally since she's reading off of s teleprompter
does NOT answer the question
How can she be so stupid??? Is this for real??
Are we this stupid to not believe that these people intentionally planned to allow this illegal invasion of this Country. And used the resources of the Country to feed, house and clothe them.
Does Bret Baier's obvious face-lift surgery count as gender reassignment? That's not very manly.
Why doesn’t he get his respect and be called President Trump like they do everyone else
When has fox ever questioned trump like Baer is questioning Harris?

So is Donald trump running the current administration?? What’s with her blaming Donald Trump for everything, there’s almost 4yrs between Trumps administration and now, what that means is that nothing has absolutely been done in the almost 4yrs that she and Joe Biden have been in office.
She will follow the law?? When? We have border laws that are still in place and they are NOT being followed by this current administration and that includes her. She went on The View last week and said she wouldn't change anything she and Biden have done since taking office. How anyone could even think of voting for this continued failure is beyond me.
Soo… if Kamala couldn’t do anything as border zar, and will not change anything… is that not a zero solution?
Do democrats really think 4yrs of Kamala leadership will make things better? Give me some pepto-bismol pls.😅
Did she just plagiarize Joe Biden on her tax plan with 13 scholar......s
How about the Venezuelan gang’s
How in the hell are they asking her if she has remorse!!! WHEN will trump admit he botched the covid response and 1 MILLION Americans died!
Soo… if Kamala couldn’t do anything as border zar, and will not change anything… is that not a zero solution?
More Xanax then Policy ? My Head Hurts .......
This woman should actually be a case study   Why can’t she answer the question?  It’s annoying
Dumb is still Dumb no matter how try to avoid answering the question with your Bullsh-t blabbering about nothing.  Idiots are born every day!  When was she?
If her policy is so good, why it didn’t work for past 3 years ?
Can she speak like a regular person
Did she answer one question in the interview?
Do you really think having 15 more agents can handle 3M people coming in illegally?
why during every sit down interview is she wearing the same pair of earrings?
What was her conviction rate?
Is she gonna answer any of the questions?
I want to know who is talking in her ear??
The real question here is, "Why didn't you leave in place executive orders that stabilized the border during Trump's administration instead of breaking the border first first and then debating the bill?
What are you talking about 😂😂😂
Is it just me or did the interview seem very short? Clear that Kamala's people were trying to cut as soon as she got flustered over lying about Biden's decline
How many times did she say “Donald Trump”? Jeez
Is this a spoof???
Think she'll still go on Joe Rogan? 😂😂😂
Where are all those checks for those that were devastated in the hurricanes...Ohhh...that's right, other countries got that money...
She sounds like an absolute idiot. How is it that at this point of her campaign she STILL sounds like that one hungover dude in class who forgot he had an oral report due that day?!
Kabala represents the new generation of the Kommunist Party. Right Komrade Kabala?
Anyone notice the earrings?
And she wants to get rid of the filibuster??? That is all she does is filibuster
Why even have her on ? if your not going to let her talk .
Why doesn’t she go back to office and sign a executive order to stop people from crossing
This is supposed to be an interview? My man, I understand you probably interrupt your wife and her boyfriend, but let Kamala talk!
Did you see the snarl?
How is she going to pay for this after her house plan bankrupt people
Why cant she just answer a question
Why was Bret interrupting constantly?
Has she ever answered a question?
No accountability. Turn what page? She has been in office for 3 and a half years
Why are you being so rude madame VP? You surely aren't talking down and acting defensive during an interview holding you accountable for your administration? Sure isn't looking good for you.
Did this woman leave this interview by flying away on a broom?
Is it not ride that he addresses her per madam President and she in turn calls him by his first name. In Europe it is unthinkable
How many times did Trumps name come out of her mouth?
Is it just me or is it very suspicious that every interview she is wearing these earrings?
The border bill they keep saying Trump stopped wasn't even introduced until Feb 2024. What is her excuse for the period of time from Jan 2021 to Feb 2024? While our border was wide open
Where are HER clips demonizing Trump….?
Is this the entire interview from beginning to end? I thought it was going to be 1 hour long without commercials?
Why make the title of this video so complicated?
Why is she yelling?
Does harris even know she's been vice-president the last four years? It seems she doesn't.
We the People, the 100,000,000 dollar question is? Who do you want representing you in affordability,growth, prosperity, in the law, in wars, Internationally, in safety, against Communism and as an American Citizen!!! We don't know her because she has done nothing positive for WE the People!!! Trump or Kamala?? Choose intelligently God bless America, everyone & President Trump😊
Where the hell is her Latin accent??? I am so F'N burdened by this!!!
Are those the earrings?? 👀
Is this the whole interview?
Why didn't Trump show up?
Anyone seen Ben Grimm and Bret baier in the same room?😂
What a waste of time watching this. She never gets to the point . she's a scramble head, all over the place, and never answers the question.  Im done ✔️
When was she at border like three years later... LOL
🤦🏻‍♂️ what plans is she talking about? She speaks in completely empty broad strokes with no particulars. So utterly painful. She’s single handedly setting women back a generation.
Didn't answer a single question and kept babbling and talking down to bret. She is so rude.Jeez
Is she even capable of answering a question when asked?
A topic of discussion? Really?
Is this the full interview?
Is this what a bloodbath looks like? 🤣
Was Minneapolis a peaceful protest it could have been if waltz had called out the national guard to keep the piece instead of waiting for it to get unpeaceful
How is she asked a question whose answer is a number (i.e., “how many”) and she answers with a word salad?! She answers not a single question. Shameful that anyone would elect her to any position. I know I didn’t.
Is this woman a capable of forming sentence that isn’t prescripted ???
Turn the page? We are on your page Kamala. Yours and Bidens. Why should we follow you when you're SECOND in power? We dont need your pages.
Where is the full interview at???
How anybody can watch this and still vote for her is beyond me.
Why was Diaper Don dancing???
Does it Even Matter Anymore?? She WILL NEVER ANSWER THE QUESTION TRUTHFULLY OR AT ALL!!
What is he doing he interrupted her answers
Where’s the laughs and smiles? Not so confident now huh
