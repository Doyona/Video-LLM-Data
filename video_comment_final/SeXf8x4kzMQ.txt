Does anyone know who made this wheelchair? This design looks perfect. I'm looking for one for my dog!
Does San Diego allow dogs to be off-leash in public areas?
Does anyone know how the dog go bathroom with the wheelchair on and outside?
So awesome, are there little booties you can give him so his feet don't drag on the ground? Love this.
Does he need tennis shoes on his back feet? He is awesome. Prayers and kisses to baby dog boo❤❤❤❤
What’s the purpose of the dog carrying his own leash?!!😂😂
why does one have a leash??
Does it not hurt their feet?
We all should learn from such wise and innocent creatures.  How would you look at life if you had those same disabilities? Would you be so happy and full of life like this precious pup if you had the same disabilities? We should learn from nature that to be full of life with abundant happiness is true life in spite of disabilities.  God bless his innocent creatures that could also be our teachers
Is it a girl because she is so happy and cute and I love her
Did I just see  a dog on wheels  that moves faster than I do?   Crazy 😂
Why is he so cuteee!!
( what The Hell is so " Rainbow 🌈 About that ? )
Has anyone watched it and not smiled?
Is there hopes that poor dogs disable like this will ever walk I pray to God that is possible they look very happy that's a blessing 😊
Is there something that the hind legs could sit in?🫶🏽
How  much pleas tell
Nice video. What kind of dog is the white one? Blue heeler with boarder collie?
What is with the white dog?   Mom just hands him his leash.  Does he walk himself??  Lol.  Adorable.
Why is the other dog carrying the leash in his mouth
Where is their leash.
Should the paws be held up so they don't drag?
Looks like her hindlegs are dragging on the ground. Shouldn't they be protected? You can add straps to that wheelchair.  ❤❤
Can you give him like a sock or a protective brace for his Right back leg? It scrapes the ground very often when he uses the wheelchair.
No offense. But isn't it dangerous to let the dogs run loose, especially in the intersections? Seems like another accident waiting to happen
Where to buy this kind of wheel chair for dog?
How to apply the brakes?
Do you worry about his foot dragging on the ground?
why is the dog like that? Did he get a polio version of sickness for dogs when it was still a puppy?
How is letting your dogs run uncontrolled along road where cars can be backing out or pulling into their driveways. Seems kind of careless wirh safety wuth both the dogs and people driving who might swerve to avoid hitting the dog.
She’s a speedy little girl in her wheelchair! Is that what it’s called? That doesn’t seem quite right! ❤😮❤😊
Where is this taken place at?? Just wondering because the dog is carrying his own leash running freely down the sidewalk and looks as if its normal practice
Is that from cruciate disease?
Doesn't the dog need boots on to prevent grazing
This is adorable but is it just me or is there a bolt needing tightened on that left wheel? 😂😍🥰
What if he gets under a car and won't be able to stop😬
Am I going to hell for laughing.?
She never did hang on to the other dog's leash, does she want two disabiled dogs?
It's great for the dog. But what about his paw dragging, won't it get sore?
Does it hurt him when his legs drag on the ground?
Great owner for caring, but what's with the dog holding it's own leash?
His paw is dragging…can’t be lifted higher so the dog doesn’t get hurt?
Where do you find these “wheelchairs” for dogs? Thanking you in advance!
What happened to his leg?
Why am I crying  ? As the widow of a wheelchair bound husband ,  this video means the world to me ! ❤❤
The pups wheelchair wheels look loose on the left ? Or maybe it’s just me 🙏🏼🫶🏼💜🙏🏼🫶🏼💜🙏🏼🫶🏼💜😇😇😇😇
Does he not need special boots so his paws don't get hurt on the concrete?
Did anyone else think his butt was ITCHING when you first saw him dragging on rhe rug? 😅 Bless his heart ❤️
Why does the dog have thepurple leash
Love the video. Are leashes optional where you are?
When idiots allow their nasty dogs to run free and others have to move away 🤦🏽‍♂️ when will they learn…
Is he wormy
where can I get this?
Can u put shoes on the back legs please ❤
surly you could add some socks to keep the back legs from dragging on the ground?
Anyone else laugh at the very beginning of the video and then felt guilty for laughing when you realized the puppy was paralyzed?
A leash? Idk
Why are they running around with a leash but no one walking them? There's a busy road and other people???
When I see the joy on this dog's face, I have to question why  anyone would feel that the inability to use his hind legs would ever reduce the quality of his life. Good bless this family! 😍💕🐾
What is this stuff coming out of my eyes?
I the only thing I was wondering was and I love the wheelchairs for the doggies was why she didn’t have the wheelchair available to the dog in the house why was the dog having to scoot on the floor? You know it’s easier just to let the dog roll around the house in the wheelchair all the time.
How does it potty
What could have happened to his/her legs?
Who else thought the dog was doing that butt scooting thing at first?
That other dog just holds the leash in his mouth?? What?
why am i crying seeing the dog running with his bright face
Would it be unsafe to add a pouch for the legs? Or is them dangling along ideal?
Did yoh make that wheelchair for your furbaby? It looks easy to make there is so many animals out there who would love one of those. So freaking awesome how easily your furbaby runs.
The back foot rubs against the floor. Should the height be adjusted?
Where are the brakes though
What happened to this dog?
What about the brown racing stripes on the carpet?
Is he dragging his back feet? They will get all scraped up
Is that wheel loose
Where did you find the wheelchair?? Have an old dog who needs one too!!
Where are their leashes?
Did the dogs legs break from running into traffic woth no leash?
2cute..but how does he stop?? ❤
Um..was it hit by a car? That street seems a little busy
How can I make a wheelchair like that?
Amazing!! Is there a way to make sure that foot isn't hurt? I just mean about infections and stuff if they get cut. But thank yooou thank you
Is it okay for the dog to drag it back legs on the ground like that or do you have to raise it up a little
What happens to the other dog ~ has leash but walking by self?  Or was it just momentarily?
Does she want two disabled dogs? Letting them run around on their own without a leash is bound to end up in an accident one day. Even if you think you're in full control of your dog, you have no idea what other people and animals will do.
Does his right rear paw that's dragging on the ground become abraided?
Did the dog grab his Leash and he’s walking himself . ❤
Wouldn't that be dangerous? Take him to some park instead of open sidewalk with busy road. Those wheels doesn't have a break mechanism I guess
A running puppy....!? Is a HAPPY PUPPY!
No rules about leashes?
How many worms did the dog leave behind?😅
It's great! I'm just wondering, how does brake with the wheelchair?
Why doesn't this owner walk her dog with a leash? If she did that, she wouldn't be able to protect the dog from the car society.
I was just wondering would that not hurt his back feet if it gets dragged? Maybe the harness should be lifted a little bit higher.
Why is she not leeching them? That is irresponsible. All good until an accident happen and the dog’s life pays for it.
Why are they off-leash?
Oh my Dear Lord they are adorable?.  💕 😘 🫂 🙏
Her feet dragging the ground don’t get scratched up? I seen some chairs like that for other dogs that had a little thing like a strap that didn’t allow the feet to touch the ground at all. Glad she has you.
what about other dogs and cars.. adorable.. but wonder if they should be with owner on leash for safety from other stray dogs., and cars, ect.
Who's cutting onions?
Did anyone know they have a doggie chiropractor 😮....I didn't until recently....IF ANY CHIROPRACTORS OUT THERE WANT TO TAKE UP HELPING OUT FUR BABIES....WE NEED YOU...dogs feel pain just like we do ❤
Putting a leash on your dog then letting him run down the street?
I wonder if the back legs could go into a device like an elliptical and if that would help get the nerves and blood flowing to regain some function? Anyway, thank you for loving this doggo!
What? I don’t get it. What’s the point of that leash if it’s not even on and held. You can’t let your dogs run free on the streets.
What was the point of giving the other dog a leash?
Is there a sling to keep the toes off the ground? It looks like they are dragging the tops of their feet which isn't good.
How about making a little "basket" to keep his feet up off the ground.
Can the back legs be picked up as not drag on the ground? Looks like it can hurt. Thank you for your loving heart.
Does his paw scrape tho?
Aren’t his hind legs hitting the pavement?
Am I the only one concerned about the booty scoots on the carpet? Very cute doggies though. 💕
Can anyone share the brand of that wheelchair please?   Its soooooo user friendly and solid
How can he stop? İt seems dangerous when he runs.
why doesn't he wear it at home too?
does he ever wear the wheels inside or is that too difficult bc of the furniture and stuff??
Where can I get that for my chihuahua puppy and my other grandmother’s chihuahua because they are both also paralyzed
No leash law there?
May I ask the purpose for of the leash?
The toes are dragging the ground. Why aren't they in a sling?
I'm sorry to ask, how do they potty? Because I notice they have clean and fluffy butt 🫶
What is the point for the leash? I guess 4 the doggo 2 put it in his mouth. Bc hes gone
If you put something to protect the back legs and that way he or she is not going to be dragging them?
Totally awesome,, I love it ❤❤❤  Where can I get one of those doggie wheels??
That is so cool!! Umm but would it be more comfortable if your dog has a sling to support his hind legs instead of it hanging loose in the back?   Sorry for the questions.
Love the wheelchair…is one of his back legs dragging on the concrete?
Doesn't it hurt the paws dragging them?
How to travel carrying a dog in flights give some idea plz
Maybe sleeve those back legs?
Why is that one dog just carrying a leash?🧐🧐🧐🧐
Is his name training wheels 😅😅😅
Are there any wheels for pug?
Awesome! Where did you get the wheelchair?  Our baby could use one and we would like to see him as happy as yours.
Why am i also got too excited for him going out?? 🥰🥰🥰
How old is the dog?
Can something be done to lift his back feet further off the ground? Maybe a little sling or something? It looks like his toes are scraping the ground 😢
Hey! Uhh I have a question.. Can that wheelchair thing be used on daily bases? Cuz I had a puppy back then with broken back legs.(he was a stray dog) He's not anymore but future it might be helpful for other dogs
so no leash rule there?
I wonder... can you make an adjustment so his legs dont scrub the floor?  Good to see him so happy😊
Does is paw hit the pavement?
where is your cart from? the front harness is so much better than the one we have for our pup.  such cute dogs😊
Do them back paws need booties when walking outdoors?
Cute video but what good does the leash do if you don't hold it. What if an aggressive dog comes out of nowhere?
Doesn't the back paws get rubbed raw from dragging some?
The way he is looking at you! Come on, mom, hurry!!!! Question Does his foot ever drag the ground? Just wondering ❤These pups are so happy ❤❤❤
Did the dog get hit by a car ???
That's sweet =) Maybe you should try putting a strap to secure his back legs under his belly ? It would prevent them from dragging on the sidewalk and getting hurt.
Can you get a handicap placard for that dog?
fix the wheels?
How much does thos cost?
Where are the brakes ?
Running off leash! That couldn't be how the dog wound up that way, could it? Lack of care for the dogs and the public.
What was the leash for?
Did the dog hit the tree? They are cute, but you should guide them better so that no accidents happen.
His back right foot drags on the pavement... that's not good??
Protect the paws that rub...right???otherwise he will get hurt 👌👋😅
Your so good for taking care of a disabled dog, but shouldn't his back legs be held up higher so they do not get caught in any way or hurt?!  He is so blessed to have you as a mom or dad or both.  He looks so happy bless him.
"Where's the dog?" "I don'tknow. Did you try following the brown streak? He'll be at the end of that."
What kind of dog is the black and white one? And kudos for contributing such a nice role in the handucapped dogs life!
Love the dogs. Why are they running on a busy street without a leash?  They could run in the street....unless I am missing something
Could u please check his back legs r touching the floor  b careful pleaseeeeee
What's the  purpose of the leash if you dont put it on?!?!
And then they don't put him on a leash??  You're the type of person that gets mad at a driver for your dog getting hit, yet it is your fault.  It is dangerous in many ways to let a dog off a leash, especially a special needs dog.  Wait until the dog park and follow the rules.  Dont just brush off the rules and put your dog in harms way!
No leash on either dog...makes you wonder how he lost the use of his legs...car,maybe?🤔
Did anyone notice that the dog is without a leash running on the street
His one foot seems like it doesn't work as well and catches the cement, it doesn't scrape his foot does it?
Why do you have leashes of you aren't going to use them
They are so adorable  and happy.....but leashes? Please? Some of us freak out when an unleashed dog runs up and my dog (on a leash) will attack.....i dobt want that, and neither do you.
Why sre those wheels do loose?
How do dogs with wheelchairs do their business? We own a GS and we're seeing some signs.. And we're afraid that she'll be needing one in the near future. So I'm just curious. If anyone would be so nice as to explain it, thank you ❤
Great pooches and obviously loved. Why not put the leash on before you leave the house though?
Should lift the back legs off the floor in the support they seem to be hitting the floor
Maybe its just me overly-concerned but what about his back right leg kinda scraping? Maybe a strap to hold it up idk 👍
Why even have a leash
How does a rear paralyzed dog potty?
Childless?  And we complain about becoming the minority
Both dogs are adorable. I guess I would be afraid the dog would get ahead of me into the street before I could stop them. Does the dog in the wheelchair ever have injuries on the rear legs?  I know they can’t feel back there and if they’re injured it can be serious serious
His wheels are wobbly. Are they supposed to be that way? If not, can I donate to get him less wobbly ones?
Is it me or the dogs are going for a jog??
I notice his feet dragging some.  Might booties or a little sling help protect him??  What about his elimination needs??  What uf he has to go at 11:30 pm???
Way cool  Can there be something made for his back feet to lift them up????
Why is it so hard for abled bodied people to say “disabled”
How do you keep them out of the street?
Do His Lil Back Paws hit the Pavement???
Hahaha, she has her leash. Oh was I supposed to holding the other end? Hmm, I will work on that. lol
Is there a way to bring the back legs higher so they don’t drag? His little feeties 🥺
He can't do what???? 😂😂❤❤❤❤
How come the dog can’t have the wheelchair at home. Like why not let your dog be able to be a normal dog all day. Instead of just for walks. Just curious. Not bashing you. Just wondered why.
There aren't leash laws?
How does he do his business?
What are these for anyone i see allot of dogs in these
Was The dog Born like that or was he in a Accident im just asking because i dont know
How does the w/c assisted dog use the potty.. from a nurse.
Is his foot draggin? No need to spend on dog nail trimming upkeep 😂😂😂
YouTube audience: how cute Pedestrians: why do I have to dodge your unleashed dogs? Drivers: I didn’t see the dog until it was too late
What all the brown lines on your floor?
Oh how beautiful is that! Do you find that your dog that's in the wheelchair assistant ..do you find that his back legs/feet scrape on the ground at all? (his paws rather) Lol...
It's great you help dog with wheel chair etc. But WHY are you letting them run wild down  the sidewalk beside a BUSY STREET...what's your solution when something unexpectedly distracts them and they run into traffic chasing it? Seems dangerous to me. Am I missing something here???
Im guessing by the way you let your dogs run uncontrolled out in public that it needs the wheels because it was hit by a car?
Left wheel looked a little loose or just me?? But such excited doggos
I can tell you love your dog dearly but what if a car was backing out of a driveway and had just completed their head-check when he suddenly ran behind them as they backed up?  Wouldn't it be safer to put the wheels on at the local school track?
Why do you just let them run off leash
Booties for back paws😢 ? Road burn?
Love the dogs being so excited to go outside- but what, exactly, is the point of putting the other dog on a leash that is just dragging behind him- and forcing the pedestrians to get out of the dog’s way as he races down the sidewalk?
Do his lil feet drag on the concrete?
Any chance we could get that dog some Skyway mags from the 80s?
IS THE DOG WALKING ITSELF THO???
Doesn't his legs dragging like that get raw from scraping the sidewalk?❤❤❤❤
So sweet. So happy. How do her toes not get scratched off from dragging?
Do they have a route they take everyday that is the same so you know pretty much  exactly where they are ?
Don’t those back feet need to be raised a bit?
So the other dog just carries a leash? He's decided to walk himself 😅😅 Ok
Why are they off leash though
Why is Adams REDUCING POLICE?
Where can I get one for my dog
Do his back paws need booties to keep them from dragging on the pavement?  In grass it would not hurt the paw, but concrete can. What a great dog Mom, that wheelchair is fantastic.  Gave the pup his joy and vitality back.  So cute when they go running together.   God bless this precious family.  Stay safe, watch out for cars and aggressive dogs.
How does he go outside to pee (etc)??? Can't do that with the cart. #1 probably, but not #2...🤔
