Hey Mia! Can you do this but for swimsuits?
Can you show us more off this brand’s dresses?
Hej Mia! Can you do another video with more different dresses from aym? Love u❤
How do you know they’re not just plain lying on the website, just take their word for it?
Can you do a review of Pact clothing??
Hii! I love ur vids and I have a question! Is ur mom going to vidcon with u? Also can’t wait to see u then!!!!
$170 for polyester? Maybe I'm just not fashion literate, but polyester 😧
❤Will you do a review of son de flor?" I really want to know if it is worth the price and will withstand many washes. ❤
Ones?  One is not a plural. Who writes this stuff?
Do y’all not realize that all fabric types have a time and place in fashion? No one is making a swimsuit out of cotton. No one wants a “wrinkle free” suit to be made of linen. Aritzia makes pants using their “crepette” fabric which is 100% polyester. But it’s well made, well fitting, and it basically doesn’t wrinkle, even if you crumple it. All natural materials like cotton and linen have their time and place but so does polyester. Same with things using metal and glass while some use plastic. There will always been a need for all three, they each thrive in different uses
Did you get a patent on your designs? Or do they not matter when they get stolen in another country? 🤔😒
It’s a pretty dress and it’s nice if it’s ethically produces.  But polyester ?? There is nothing sustainable about polyester. And there are so many fabrics around that perform the same and are at least biodegradable. Polyester is around forever.
can you review Rayn? I wanna buy but i am plus size and I'm scared it won't fit well and also is expensive so... AFRAID
Ok but why do you keep relacing it? Just pull the dress through....
I get what you’re saying about ethical products, but… polyester, really? For a summer dress?
Can you do a video about like high end expensive popular products and then test Shein or temu dupes I think that would be really fun (if you haven't already done it) btw I love to watch your videos😊❤❤
Am I the only one that can not defend an expensive almost 100% POLYESTER dress? It's such a bad, cheap fabric...
Your plant look beautiful what are care tips?
Love these videos!!! Can you test the viral Taylor Swift lilac short flowy skirt!? I am getting so many adds since the song imgonnagetyouback came out! What is the real one vs the fakes?? I need to know
The polyester kills me! The worst fabric! Why?
Petition for a whole haul from this brand??????
$36.00 is too much for this cheap-looking dress... Why would you pay over a $125.00 for it?
I love my AYM dresses and I still wear them, but I’ve found they are very prone to (I don’t know the word) … like when it brushes against something rough it …rips? Like tiny little rips. Almost a fray.   I have to be VERY careful when I wear them. Brick texture is the worst. I leaned against brick wall and now that half of the dress has little frays.  It’s very disappointing but my fault for not being careful. Just wanted to warn anyone before they buy 🥰
all of my pinterest promoted ads lately are for baby formula?? maybe i should stop referring to my cats as "babies" when my phone is listening 😂
When did polyester become desirable though?
So how do you stop from people selling someone else’s products?
😂😂😂😂 should we jump into it? Sorta
I know it wouldn't completely solve the issue, but why don't companies watermark (or have the store name) in their ads, and like dead center so that they can't easily be removed?  I may be a bit naive in thinking this, but I feel like it could help from items being stolen so often.
Some of their dresses are extremely basic. Like generic dress but with exceptional fabric or patterns. I don't know these are really a pattern you can steal?
Could you do a video reviewing more of their items on you and on your mom? Since it's a little on the expensive side I'd really love to see more clothes on 2 different body types before purchasing
100$ for a polyester dress with a fugly neckline? No tnx😂
Are you doing another full length video this week?
Mia can you try the brand Selkie? The one that has girls from all different sizes on their princess dresses please?❤
Can we get a full video trying this brand???
Mia, can you do a video trying other AYM clothing? All their products look so nice!
