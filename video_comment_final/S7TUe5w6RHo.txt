please can we have a version where the narrator talks less? i love to use this video as background while i study but the narrator talking disturbs me and i can't concentrate properly
Where did the rain come from in the beginning? No water vapour to form clouds would mean no rain. Also, water is H20, no oxygen in the atmosphere, would mean no water, right?
facebook doesn't allow me to share this with a preview image, wtf??
When will these individual cells start to make this video.

Cool video! But i wonder why you didn't include the formation of the banded iron formations? The entire ocean being read for millions of years seems like a pretty cool detail to leave out. Someone correct me if there has been any new discoveries of that not being the case.
How do scientists know this happened
So wooly mammoth & megaladon didn't exist??
Why tf do I feel nostalgia watching this???
This viedeo is already year out of date can we get an update?

WTF did you start working on this video in 2019? It took 4 years to finish an hour-long video💀☠
Really interesting. But where did the rain come from? One theory is that the water or the elements of it came with meteors.
how did it rain on a hot sroching planet coverd in lava? how did water even came to existance?
how come the moon didnt have these transformations and remains the same
8:40 where does the clouds come from to make rain, i mean the planet is still basically lava? 🤔
I just want to know, how do people know all of this? Were they there, where's the evidence? Are people just guessing like a theory, 😱 Conspiracy theorists. Now I'm not talking about the Dinosaurs and all of that, I'm talking about how the earth formed, were anyone there? I'm not being disrespectful to anyone, and good job on the animators of this video, but just think about it, how does anyone even know all of this? 🤔🤔

How do we know this is what happened billions of years ago and how the earth looked like?
45:00 they invented what?
58:13 was that a reference to Jurassic world?
52:19 gondwana before pangea?
Can you predict if we have a similar pattern that we had on earth seeing an image in telescopes for another planet far away that there could be life right now? Because the image we see in telescope might be from millions years ago.
Where did the water came from?
39:54 D-did he just spit for a second??😭😂😂😂
14.3 billion years later... Who knows this refference? if you do you are a legend.
My only question after watching all of this is, if everything came about from an explosion. How did everything we need to be sustained form if there was nothing that it needed to flourish?
Can anyone tell which software is used ????😉
What kind of joke is this? Seems like still in a learning phase of documentary creation

Can we have this one without narration? i love the video and use it to listen at while working. narration can be an distraction sometime.
How about these all are just absurd theories? You don’t know what happened 5000 years ago , you didn’t know these 200 years back , now you’re propagating wild theories, what if all these are far from reality and absurd predictions

Where did the water came from?
How does it rain for millions of years flooding the earth where exactly did the rain come from lmao
Why does this soundtrack remind me so much of Terraria?? Especially during the Neoarchean period.
How did water just come from nothing tho
If photosynthesis began before the mesoarchean then why wasn't there any oxygen in the atmosphere at the time?
I wonder if humans were around 200+ millions of years ago. Would we be giant like everything else back then from the abundance of oxygen and so on?
30:16 how long did you take to animate all of this?!
SO INTERESTING Who agrees? ↓
Because of the constant meteorit impacts for hundreds of millions of years wasn't the atmosphere full of ash?
anyway you could post all the music from your videos?
5 years to make this?! And thanks to mark rober for sponsoring this video because the literally took 5YEARS so well appreciated mark rober!

How do these first ever cells get created. Do they just spawn in when they feel like it or what.
@kurgezart i had some questions  - Hadean era, why isnt the moon spinning? - Hadean era, is the stars in the sky were acurate?  - Hadean era, in the end of this era, there were some cloud? is that cloud? if yes what does it contain? - Hadean era, is there any type of life form that capable to life in this era according our knowledge?  i will come back later to finish this, my baby just woke up now, and my wife needs me,
Is there anything that you don't make with love and passion?! Thank you so much
Is the Soundtrack going on Spotify? The Hadean song is  so good!
During the periods where nothing really happens, what separates it from the previous? The tiny life forms are still doing their thing, I feel like the prior should be extended until the next significant event.
Is this EARTH HISTORY??
When that mesoarchean Era album drop? 😵🤘🤘
how did life began so early?? Surely life was already present in Tea, ormaybe an asteroid...
At 19:56 when those drums kick in?. Who said this music has to be banger. GAWD DAMN
Who created the music for this ? It's so good
Hello, Spanish is my native language and the way you write the numbers does not make sense, in the video the scale is in millions of years, and thousands of these are counted.  How is it possible that thousands of groups of millions are called billions and not thousand of million?
Are there similar educational channels with animations like this one? 😔 I discovered this channel just recently, and wished that I knew about it earlier.
Got stuck here in Statherian period probably because of ads, any tips on how to get back to the future?
Why don't u make a series on world history describing all important incidents & the driving force behind

is it just me realizing the part of my existence on this Earth is just 0.00000000000000000000....1%  ?
Ok the video is cool and all, but... HOW LONG DID THIS TAKE?
I wonder whether Neil deGrasse Tyson tweeted about this
Could we get earth future in 1 hour?
Do I get a prize for pointing out the glitch at 29:44? ;)  Finding that was just a result of how hypnotizing your video was. Incredible stuff as always!
I have a question about the first eon, wasn't Hades the Greek god of the underworld?
Is the voice spat at 39:45 min? 😂... Great video I lov it.
Can we just appreciate the absolutely awesome soundtrack?
Can someone explain to me where does the Water come from? H2O because there was no O at that time???

Great video, but how did life come back again after the Asteroid and how long did it take to return ? and how did first human appear ?

How long it would take the average Joe to catch up with Bezos wealth if he makes the average salary:
Hi, I have a doubt; in approximation, how big would the hydrothermal vents have been?
where does God come in all this and religion since god made earth 6000 years ago?
How do researchers even figure this out?!
9:08 rains but how? Was the water not brought by the asteroids?
What feats will humanity achieve if given the duration of life that the dinosaurs had? Maybe amazing things, maybe galaxy spanning things. Maybe just as much of a history will be left of us as is the dinosaurs, bones, and dust. Only time will tell, and only others will ever know.
8:05 sooo where from does rain come on our(?) lava planet?
Anyone watching this video stoned?
I absolutely want more videos like this on youtube!! Does anyone know more of these types of videos?
Watching this in the year 34:02?😉
Where's the asteroid☄ 33:52 (59:47)?

Is the whole set by music mountain? Pls give me a name to this massive multi million years set! Phenomenal
Where did the massive bombardment at the beginning come from? Was there a belt in our orbit at the time?
Is this all presented as factual information? The video starts off with an unproven theory of the creation of the moon. No disclaimers for theories? How can we differentiate fact from fiction here, or is this all unknown and just an idea? How complex life "may" have evolved, it should say, probably.
Bill wurtz-all of earth, less detail, 19 mins Kurzgesagt-all of earth, more detail, 1 hr Which one do you take?
But still, where did life come from?

Why does the Mesoarchean soundtrack have such "The Only Thing They Fear is You" from "DOOM Eternal" vibes? What was REALLY going on back then?! 😱
5:40 isnt that the late heavy bombardment???
will we even be here long enough to be considered a blip in the timeline?.. i hope so
here's an interesting video idea do a video where if the dinosaurs weren't wiped out how they would have evolved and if they would eventually build computers like us? Or what else would they have been able to do interesting thought
Is there lava waves back when Hadean era?

Why is there a giant t rex at the beginning of the Triassic?
The spookiest thing is... Why did life start so early???!!!
Do you guys have a video of all of human history?
Could you dub this video into Spanish please?❤
@29:43 did i understood correctly? all the oxygen combines with methane to form CO2 and water, which rapidly cools the planet down ... i thought co2 is a greenhouse gas.
why my stupid brain thought the earth is an egg, then the astereoids are the sperm
This is probably a really dumb question but if the days were shorter back then, does that mean our planet isn't really that old? Because time is time, whether it's light or dark. Like, 1 hour is 1 hour. But if days were only like 12 hours or something wouldn't that mean... OMG OK. My 2 brain cells are screaming. Nvm. I thought too hard already. Lol. I guess my question is, how would that fact affect how old our planet is?
so where did the life forms come from? were they transported here via water, or do they exist through out the solar system, and only form when the right conditions are met. like when you dry out a seed, and it grows into a plant when introduced to water
This video is already 3 months old. A lot has happened since. When will you post an updated video?

Can someon explain where the water came from in the eoarchean?
Hey I just wanted to watch something to pass the time, why have I instead gained an appreciation for the development and hardiness of life?? Why am I crying??
Where did the oxygen and hydrogen come from and why was there so much water created?
None of this is looped is it? Holy hell man your guys’ dedication is insane
How do they know we were in a lava hell phase though
? Youre missing the focal point of creation.. Jesus is not in this video
Anyone else rocking out to the wicked bass and drums during the Mesoarchean?
I wonder how long it takes to render this animation, this dude probably has GTRTXYZ 108090 PRO MAX GPU to render this
Any young earth creationist here? xD
But is it worth the antisemitism? Is it worth all of which the people of jewish ideation have suffered at the hands of their fellow man throughout history? Because, thats why

Why doesn't it have Spanish subtitles? :(
How do we know this? We don’t.
Does the paleoarchean have coral already?
My biggest question of all is how did rain form without water in Eoarchean?
How do we know this is how it happened for sure 🤔
Don’t know which one I like more. The music? Or the animation? I find myself grooving to the music while forgetting to watch the animation.😊 That’s OK. I’ll just watch it again. 😊
What camera is this?
QUICK QUESTION why did it jump from Cretaceous period to Paleogene period with no blackout?
When all earth is lava, where the rains came from?
is it called hadean becase of the greek god hades?
The paleoaerchon time period is underwater right?
The music track is a banger. Do you have it on spotify?
Can u do the entire solar system?
Are we talking about the same format of time or length of calendar years just as today when we say 4.5 Billion years ago? If it is, then it is amazing how long it was like millions of years ago when everything around is just only LAVA!😉😊
@kurzgesagt Would you guys do a version without the commenting? This like the tenth time a see this video and of course love the notes but also music is so enjoyable when I reed that I like an instrumental version… please guys!!  Upvote comment so Kurzgesagt can read it if you’re agree
Yeah but how do pundits deal with infinity  Like what was happening BEFORE the billionaire birth began smart asses?
Why were there fire asteroids hitting the earth!? What were they from another galaxy or what
how was moisture created while the planet was molten and being bombarded by asteroids?  i don't understand how water was created in this environment.
if earth is a hell of lava where did water came from?
In the Cryogenian era, shouldn't life survive under the ice? usually ice doesn't cover 100 per cent, underneath it there may be currents of water. Probably it was challenging for the sex-inventing algae and for those tiny armoured thingies, but some of them will surely survive. There is always a couple who do, not matter what.
How can I believe this ??
How do I leave 10.000 likes?  I DO need to know that... Someone invent it, please!!
What software did you use for the animations?
From what sources is this information from?
YOOOO GUYS WHY DOES THIS VIDEO STILL PLAY WHEN I PRESS THE HOME BUTTON IN A MINIPLAYER?!?!?!?!?
Can someone please explain how we know what happened 4.5 BILLION years ago? I’m curious…
How was there rain so long ago ???? (Just curious)
Oh no I'm 2 months late! What did I miss?!
So are these time frames called eras, periods, ages or what?
How long did it take to make this? must have been 217 trillion years
So, what was the catalyst for life to split into plants, algae, fungi and animals?
Why didn’t they animate the asteroid? Lazy
HOW THE HELL DO WE KNOW ALL OF THIS?
33:55 the Verdeforte impact right? Or were you talking about the Yarrabubba impact?
in what programm do you animate?
Could you make an abridged version as well that just includes the talking points and which time period they take place in?
Is it possible to get a version of this without music or voice over?
can you guys make a course on how you make these animations? would be really helpful...
do you sell those posters in a smaller book?
Shouldn't the moon rotate in the beginning? IIRC the moon synchronized with earth roration later?
Why do I always get these recommended when I’m not sober😭
So when did god stop by?
Why does this video need to be 1 hour? 45 min of it are literally useless and repetitive with no narration..
What song is used in the cretaceous period? I couldn't find it on epic mountain...
what was the tempeture in the eoarchean chapter?
What are you waiting for like this amazing very very hard worked video
What made the rain start? Absolute amazing video though
Did the univers sound this good
@kurzgesagt was this music during the Mesoarchean period made to sound like The Ocean? It really resembles their sound and if so that is an awesome homage. Especially since they are from Germany as well so it would make a lot of sense to have the connection
Is it 10 hours version insists?
Loved that, thx! Don't suppose you might have a "Edited Highlights" version of that, that I could show to some kids? That would be amazing and would save me having to learn how to drive a video editor! :)
Time of insects next? :D
Did the narrator voice the 'How it's Made?' tv show? 🤔
The secret of nature?                  Is p  a  t  i  e  n  c  e
What if A.I. did this in just 2 minutes 💀😢
So I’m confused. The Great Oxidization Event happened in the Silurian? I thought it was before the Cambrian.
@kurzgesagt Is the music after 55:55 also available? The soundtrack linked ends shortly before :/
Can this possibly reach 1 billion views?
Who else noticed the moon getting further away?
Why would it start raining if there was no water on earth?
How did you get the information from the start of the time
Hey, can we get the posters even larger? They are amazing but not big enough
So where do saltwater in the sea come from if everything was hard magma before it started to rain?
Innocent question, why this only happen on earth, and not on other near planet like mars...?
What even is time?
How would one measure the passage of “years” without the Earth’s rotation around the sun … ?
How the fck you know all of this?😅
I wonder how many tons of space rock must of landed on earth during all that time it was being smashed by meteors😮🤔
how can i have picture-on-picture mode in kurzvesagt, but not on other vids.  But thats great though 😊
This video is a literal Art piece just digitally, amazing. Since 1,250,000 years pass each second in this video as we are watching I think it would be    S O    C O O L  IF YOU MADE A SEQUAL OF SOME KIND TO THIS But instead do the past 1,250,000 YEARS IN ONLY     O N E   H O U R   🤯 so like 300 something years passing each second we watch??!  (Sorry not that great at math 😂🥲🤠)    YALL TAG HIM  PLEASE 🙏🏻
Where's the rain come from in 3925 Million Years Ago?
Loved this video! I wanna know if anyone else felt a strong TOOL influence in some of the music? Wondering if that was an intention of the creators. Truly brilliant content, well done! Looking forward to more :)
What was it like to be the cameraman
So where does adam and eve come in? Lol
Is this the best YT video ever created?
Are you planning to do a similar video about human history?
This animated timeline is really neat. Just a quick question - How did it begin to rain at the end of the Hadean period?
Where did the rain come from?!
Whoa what happened at 29:41 ?
Can we talk about Ethnoarchaeology in ways that explore ethnography, and the habits and customs of people and cultures.
Background music artist ??
Where did the dinosaurs come from??
Is this what happens when you fund a bunch of Demo Scene Nerds and give them science homework?!  F'n Amazing work.
That's clearly fake, where is the bearded magical man that shat out the earth and pissed out the oceans?
where does the rain come from?
What about now?
Could you guys also make a timeline of humanity this way? I am really curious about this timeline in more detail as well 😁
What is that blue thing at 31:37 ?
Umm excuse me! Where is the rain coming from at the beginning?
where did the water came from?.
anyone knows music or dj that does this kind of music?
Clouds existed during the Hadean period?🤔
So, do religious people just ignore this stuff?
What song is at 59:16 please?
What if this was God's pov
Where is Theia?It supposed to crash into the Earth a long time ago.
How can everything around me feel ao meaningful when Im rationally not more than a partical of dust.  Amazing video once again!!
1:00:00 What is this track and where do I find it? I tried but I couldn't find it.
Will you put out a german version? This would be perfect for a geography lesson in school.
Loved it. Is there a version without narration by chance?
where does the water come from?
How can you confirm or deny earths age when carbon dating and its analysis caps out around 50 thousand years accuracy? Just a guess hey?
All of human history was only a second.  Dyou think l maybe why we haven't met aliens yet that it's because we might be the first self aware intelligent life in the galaxy?
Can you do a similar video for the history of the universe, similar to "Timelapse of the Future" by MelodySheep?
Could someone please explain to me how we as humans know about what happened for the past 4.5 billion years ago 🤔........how do they know.....
Thank you for such an incredible effort in this video!   What i am curious about, is "has anyone ever tried to extrapolate the original coordinates in space and time of our planet and solar system from the beginning? Would something like that even be possible or practical?"
Anyone else reminded of Tool in some of the music during the Mesoarchean? Lol 19:30
Whata snooze fest. Long pauses for what?!?
Why does the moon become gigantic again in the cretaceous?
Now I can't wrap my head around this... How can we tell when the Earth iron core was formed? How did the fossil records change so scientist deduced that the core formed and didn't existed before this? 42:15
Could you do a video on the history of humans and cultures?
Can there be a version with just the soundtrack and animations? Could be cool to have playing in the background for a social or something
History of the entire world i guess revamped?
Who did the music? Sounds like a DJ set 👀
Where did the cells come from? I know I'm not the smartest guy out there but come on man how does something more complex then a city just form from rock and lava? Genuine question guys, I'm not trying to be an ass.
is narrator the same guy who narrated national geographic?
Hello, may I know what are the smokes in the Ectasian period? Nice video tho. I watched through the hour. I love it. 😍😍😍
What will happen in the future ?
Why do you guys lie about this stuff
i wonder how many times life tried to emerge over and over but something always kept it from happening then finally calmed enough to let life happene
Can someone please tell me how much time was spent on this ONE video
Where can you find the song played in the carboniferous part?
How can we be so sure About that hadean éra ?
Can you upload a version with just the music, so we can listen to it as an ambient sleep track?
Well how do you know this?
Okay. But, why? Seems like we (humans) will always in the end get back to this question. Why all this? How could all of this happen and exists?
Urrmmmm , Why and how did the water come about ?! (Maybe i wasn’t paying attention)
can we have this for wallpaper engine? <3
Wait, so we weren't created by an already existing all-powerful life form?
Who here watched until the end? v
how the human era is defined?  12000 years seems short since there are homo sapiens much longer than that
What's the point of history when we never learn from it?
Is it weird that the first video I saw on this channel was the one about obliterating the Amazon rainforest with nuclear weapons, and then ending the planet?
Can you please upload a version without music just with the voice and sound effects
What was the music that started in the Cretaceous Period through the end of the video? So good.
Why does this look so real
Why did the ice unfreeze randomly in the cryogenian? Just an animation loop miss?
Where to download these amazing soundtracks?
Is there a VR version of this?
What happened at 29:42?
random glitch at 29:43 ?
What did we do to deserve such a incredible video?
Did i accidentally get premium or have kurzgesagt and yt been generous enough to make an exception for this vid
i wonder what the rain was like during the eoarchean era. was it akin to the rain from a severe thunderstorm or was it even worse than all accounts of rain recorded by humanity?
WHy is the music, animation so good and how do yall get it so factually correct it is so mind boggling. PLUS the fricking music matches all the themes of the eras so well
I thought it was recently proven that earth had two moons after the collision that assimilated in orbit?
what songes are these i need to learn more about rock fusion and how to make music like risk of rain
Can we get a 10 hour with music only this sound track is a bop❤
Can I make this desktop wallpaper?
Was this animated with Microsoft Paint 😳😳. Kinda rough looking
Did @arminvanbuuren made the trancey soundtrack? Its so epic
THE FLOOR IS LAVA???
This only has 5.9M views!?!? This video should have more like 590 M views
where did the water that rained in EOARCHEAN come from?
I have a question. In Eoarchean period, did it rain unstoppably, or were there breaks for hours/days/months?
51:23 whoa... how indeed...?
what is it called when you can just stare at a white wall (in this case, this one-hour video nontstop with cool music) without doing nothing, and you just enjoy it nevertheless? because that's what it feels like watching this
how did life "form" tho? it just seems too easy
I wonder how many, if any, supernovas would have lit up in the sky over this time period?
How did it rain for millions of years, filling the ocean? How is the rain being created and why? Could of put so much more information in this.
Who did the music?
But still, where did all the water appear from?
This is amazing! What is the song called for the last 10min? Awe inspiring!
Getting caught up on the backstory. Is this a good starting point?
Will this Video come on the german channel too?
How am I just now discovering this channel
can you plz make some frames of the animation into seamless wallpaper background? They look stunning =)
Can you make a 1 hour video on human history as well. ❤
Is this the guy from How Its Made? If so.. nice.
6:53 where did this asteroid come from? 8:37 where did this water come from?
@kurzgesagt will there be a german version? I would like to show it to my parents.
What are all those things falling from the sky in Hadean phase
What's the soundtrack @ 58:46 Cretaceous? It's my fav and been listening to it in other vids too
How many times did Premiere crash trying to export this monstrosity of a project?
Why and how did the moon move away from the early Earth? Why did it stop at the distance from us that it is now?
How can there be rain if there isn’t any water?
Where tf did all the water come from
does the music at 35:15 sound like the TMNT theme to anyone else?
ok so when you say  some microbes invent tiny armour do you mean they make tiny armour or evolve tiny armour?
Love the concept, but it just suddenly started raining?? Where did the water come from 🤔
Soundtrack when? No hurry. After all, it's taken us this long to get here, I can wait...
Could it be possible that there was complex life in the Siderian but no archaeological trace is left?
Can we get a whole album of that Mesoarchean music? That could go so hard
To think we did so much in such a short time… how come no other species could do the same?
With each eon that passes, the question on my mind is: "If I had a time machine, how dangerous would it be to me if I were to visit Earth at this point in time?"
What a video! What js your favourite time point? Probably Calymmian for me! 😁
what did take so long to start the explosion of life what was the spark that caused single cells to start developing rapidly
where did thwe music come from?
20:29 dream theater?
i'm amazed how i can watch for almost an hour and learn little to nothing. One fact per era? i learned almost nothing about each era this video could've either been 10 minutes long, or should've had much more information packed in. The length feels gimicky to me, seeing as 99% of the video is ambient music along with a nice lil scrolling animation.
i still don't get how you get life without God? you can't just mix water with some minerals and get a frog, if that was the case the galaxy would be teaming with life.
How can y'all make this for free without sponsors or ads OMG thanks a lot this channel is the best.
How do you fooking know that is true this is just scientist tentative opinion  They are all lying us
Are there any metalheads in the sound design team? The soundtrack has a @theoceancollective vibe that I absolutely love.
Can you make video in Hindi language please sir ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Can you make video in Hindi please ❤❤
What is that music that starts approx. At 4:00?
1:01:50 what is this song called?
How did it rain for the first time without clouds😢
When does the thera impact happen?
I wonder what the next 4.5 billion years will look like.
Dude, can you travel back and ask the asteroids where they got that boppin music?
where does the rain come from? does the meteor cause the rain?
I absolutely love this but is it possible to get one without the narration?
@59:40 Whats that? La-Vos?
08:00 is water in the ocean always salty?
Where's Mochi's Credit?
Would it be possible to eventually (maybe in a year) reupload this video with the same animation and music, but with some more narration? Some more facts and explanations of the facts would be awesome.
I'm not sure if I missed something. But why did it suddenly start to rain? Considering how rare water seems to be. Where did it come from?  Great video ❤
Where is god?
How did the first rain in the eoarchean era begin / happen though?
Why didn’t you show the asteroid impact around 33:00
why is nothing on beat with the music, i see a largely missed creative opportunity here
Is there a way to put this as my desktop wallpaper?
But when the rains started in the Eoarchian era, how did the water get there to begin with?
Much hot than comfy? Otherwise amazing tho!
Is there a way to get an uncompressed render of this? It'd make for a killer desktop background :)
What happened to theia?
But where did all the rain come from that filled the oceans?
Can we get this condensed to 20 mins? I would love to learn the history of it but don't have an hour to watch 😢
How can it rain in period that earth hadn’t atmosphere and steel low concentration of oxygen?
them single celled organism are pretty unproductive, ey?
Where does the rain, i.e. water, suddenly come from in the Eoarchean period?
what is the music used in the cretaceous period onwards? its soo calming
Soundtrack Name from 59:00 ?
Something is bugging me, we have Paleocene before Eocene, so why is Eoarchean before Paleoarchean ?? Anyone that could shed a light?
What are the artifacts @29:43?
Was the moon tidal locked from the start? I thought it was locked when it could off but during the time it was hot it had a bigger spin.
How comes this video can be played in the background without YouTube premium membership?
Would it be possible to get a version of this without the narration? Not that I dislike it, far from it, it's just that for the purpose of studying/working, the occasional voice lines are kind of distracting in an otherwise perfect video for background play
But the moon is far older than the earth, how do you account for that?
Who else loves the bit of the music at 31:39?
It’s still much hot and comfy  Is the narrator computerised? I always thought it was a real person
When will the 3h director's cut, including the beginning of the universe, be released?
Why does the mesoarchean soundtrack go so hard??? i wasnt expecting that. loved the video!
Do you have version without narrative?
when and where Adam and Eve entered the picture? :)
On 10 minute is UFO in background? 😂
Where is the prequel to this movie
Will this also be available in German? My son doesn't speak English yet, but loves your videos
How did that take 4 years to make???? It's basically a loop. Could be AI generated even
At percent c should you be traveling, for 4.5 billion years to time dilate to 1 hour?
Anyone else getting Terraria vibes from the Siderian Era?
How about you compile these slides into some 25 or 50 pages of a magazine? The graphics are amazing.
Are we gonna loose the moon if it's going further away?
Where is the 13.8 Billion Years version ? 😅 Thank you for the amazing work.
Who else here is trying to sleep?
How do you know how old earth is?
Genuine science question: So if all the oceans started off as rain long long time ago, when and how did it become seawater? Years and years of fish sweat? 🤔  Fantastic video btw, mesoarchean era music hits so hard 😎nice
When y’all making a video game
This truly is an amazing animation, very well done, and thank you! One question though, 19:14 you say there's no oxygen yet. But during the Eoarchean, it rained continuously coupled with lightning storms. The lightning should've produced a decent amount of oxygen from the subsequent electrolysis of the water, right? Since there was no organic material available for fuel/combustion to return the oxygen and hydrogen back into water?
who else is also high and watching this?
Was the bgm made by AI?
Loved this soundtrack! Where can I find more like this?
How many frames had to be drawn and how long did it take?
next year the 4500000001 follow up?
Any chance to get this without audio commentary? Just with the magnificent soundtrack?
10th anniversary? Has it honestly been 10 whole years congratulations. In a nutshell has come a long way.
I missed human history. Did I blink?
@kurzgesagt I'm enjoying the soundtrack so much, but there's one song missing that I'd love to have: that last song that plays from the Carboniferous era up to the end. It's such a beautiful song! Is there somewhere we can download that particular track?
Out of curiosity, at 10:00 when the oceas start to form, where does all that water/rain come from? And what explains the cooling down process?   Greatful for any answer!
Do the hardcore religious nuts report these kind of videos you think?
Yo did they get Bicep or someone to do the music? Unbelievably good.
Whats the music? Very enchanting. Fabulous work.
This synth pop track is amazing, what is it and where can I get more?
This had to have been done on a game engine or something… right? No way they did all this by tweening and keyframes
Can we also appreciate the sound track on this amazing animation ❤
Maybe a stupid question: does not lava needs oxygen to burn?
what is that palogene music i want to download it 😛😛😛😛😋😍😍🤩😘
how many seconds in eternity?
Nice concept... is there a short version though?
Where does the rain come from in eoarchean ?
Do fungi things
Wow where do I get this music?
One dumb dumb question: How’s the rain came if the earth was lava hot?
A whole lot of repetition, so how did this take that long to make?
29:40 What's with the weird visual glitch?
I wonder if during the period where the floor is lava and the moon was so close by, would there have been lava tidal waves?
anyone know the last song of the video? :/ 55:58 - 1:00:42 it isnt listed on their music pages or description.
can we do it in real time next?
This somewhat makes 5 billion years look so short...?
This is lovely. Is it possible to find the music somewhere?
I appreciate your effort, good video! I have a question. How did the microbes survive and multiply in boiling water???
Why does mesoatchean sound like DOOM?
8:30 Where did water come from??????????
kurzgesagt OST? a string of music videos?  spotify?  i'd legit jam to every song in this video for hours.
How was everyone's day going?  Tell me anything, have a conversation feel the need to confess. Feels like the place to do so.
Is it only me that gets into this kind of thing in the imagination as we dance in an electronic/techno music concert?
Great video. Also, Kurzgesagt is it possible to have like this video without the narration and only music? It could honestly be the perfect background music to study, read, work, or game with.
1 hour? fr? bill did it in 19 minutes
HELP! It's driving me nuts that I can't figure out the name of the music that starts at 58:47. This piece was not included in the soundtrack to this video???
Can we just appreciate they music on the background?
How does it rain so much during the Eoarchean period. Where does all the water come from?🤔
Hm. Since when water and lava can coexist together? Something is not right here.
amazing work, but one question: didnt they discover dinosaurs had feathers and their tiny hands were wings?
What if this all happened not in millions of years but only in a couple of thousand?
Wait, so Earth wasn't created in 7 Days?🤣
Can anyone give me ans of how first life forms
Am I the only one who was dropping Bill Wurtz lines at appropriate times throughout the video? I can’t be the only one..
what's the name of the song played at the end (credits) ?
55:54 which soundtrack does play at this point?? I am trying to find
Based on time stamp , If Hadean was 4.5-4 Billion years ago so the Intro would've been about 5-6 Billion years ago?
Who did the music for this? Its insanely good!
Ok, who's the aspiring DJ on your team?  Edit: Thomas and Fabian.... I'm gonna guess just based upon the birb characterizations...that Thomas was behind most of it.😅  Mad props. Keep it up...y'all should play at shows and festivals.
Wouldn’t the water early on in the planets life be from the asteroids?
Maybe a paid version with more info displayed like the temperature, atmospheric pressure, etc….?
Who else also fast forward to the part where dinosaur is and check them out first??
I have a question, so if it was only until the Siderian era that water was introduced into the planet (along with the CO2), then in the previous eras, what was the water like substance? 🤠
Can I get the soundtrack for this video on Spotify?
Is there a version without narration?
Where did water come from? And how did it cover most of the planet’s surface?
WHERE? do you screwballs get the 4 billion year figure??? The thin air⁉️
holy shit, a 1 hour long kurzgesagt video??
Not sure why, but I found the "wait what's that?" scene hilarious.
If there’s no oxygen in the atmosphere until even the mesoarchean era, where did all the rain come from ?
why does the theme go so hard bro
Didn't Melody Sheep already do this in 2018?
Okay so did King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard make this soundtrack or did King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard make this soundtrack?
What?😮 1hour Animation?😳
10:23 _time travels_ "Wh-where am i?"
We earthlings have really come far, havent we?
the eoarchean rain is confusing! the cause is not explained... where did water come to earth? was it from asteroids pounding?
Why did watching a bunch of rocks and mold make me cry all of the sudden?
I have a question. In the Eoarchean, where did the rain come from? I mean, doesn't rain come from condensed water? How does it generate water out of thin air, when rain is produced by already existing water? Maybe I'm dumb or smth but I genuinely don't know
was there music 4275 years ago?
Is the track available on Spotify?
Now I gotta ask, which time period would you want to visit for just one hour in like a hyper realistic dream?? hmm...
I Love this sooo much! Would it be possible to loop some animations as to stretch the video to 10 hours? I would really love a video like this I could just play in the background while I study or read. Thanks again for all the great stuff you do! Greetings from Germany!
How about a video on the complete history of our current UNIVERSE? Maybe they are actually working on it!
Who else stopped skipping parts since the Cambridge explosion?
how do i double like something, how do i triple like this, im definetly showing this to my kids
what i dont understand though, is that u explain like 25 min in that earth cools down cus of c02 but rn we says it gets hotter cus of co2 (prob a dumb comment but just wanted to ask)
Is it possible to get a version without the music but still have the sound effects? I'd like it on in the background with my own music over it
Anyone else vibing with the music? It’s giving Daft Punk vibes.
How could we theoretically kickstart a new planet to becoming alive?
1:00:43  why does the human have blue eyes?
When do you plan to change your name to "Langgesagt"? ;-)
no one gonna give props to the music?  1 hour of a solid score.
why skip when the asteroid hit
Kids could learn from this vidios on schools, or maybe study at home?
29:43 AI generated graphics glitch?
Is there any option to download/buy video without the youtube compression? @kurzgesagt
who else watched the entire thing i mean from beginning to the end, all 1 hour 3 minutes and 30 seconds of it
Okay but what’s the person or people that made the music for this whole video?
reptiles lived longer than us. reptilians still exist today?
How did they animate this in 4 weeks
35:15 anyone else hear any signs of turtle power?
Why does it say "millions" of years ago up in the corner, when the video is still in the billions point? That's a bit confusing.
how long did this take
Wow loved this video! Random question: anyone know how it rained for so long during the Eoarchan period? and where did that come from? (10:00)
I know i'm asking a lot but how about one hour for the entire existence of the universe ? Still.. great job this video is amazing
I wonder what the next second will look like? 🤔
can someone explain why  there's so many asteroids 4B yrs ago but none later on?
Why is the Rhyacian period such a bop tho!?
At which point the atmosphere was survivable for human to live on? Right after the great oxidation event that finally provide Oxygen?
44:52 Okay, googling came up with nothing. IS Banjomorpho Pubescence a real algae? I need to know if this is a joke.
I got a question: If photosynthesis might have started way before the Great Oxidation Event, then how come those little critters doing the photosynthesis not make oxygen? I thought photosynthesis created oxygen. Was it just such a small amount that it didn't pave the way for more complex life that the Oxidation event did?
More than 3000 people disliked the video? WHY?!
Where is 1 Hour in 4.5 Billion Years? Waiting....
The real question is, how is it even possible to know what happened 4 billion years ago???
Do you have a version of this without the music? I love the commentary, but I have an idea for a music Playlist that would go well with each epoch/eon or whatever
What if the Asteroid was an alien bomb so all the dinosaurs died so we can evolve as an human experiment
Why did it rain for millions of years? Where did the original water come from?
Can we somewhere get only the animation with music? I need to use while studying. PLEASE
Why do I hear FatBoy Slim - right here, right now ? :D
Could we get a 10 hour version of this? Hopefully you can loop the animation to make it less taxing. I'd play this during longer commutes.
Can we all agree on getting goosebumps as soon as the Cretaceous started? That music. Oddly nastolgic.
19:41 Why did the music suddenly feel like making some toned down doom eternal soundtracks? Caught me mad offguard but pleasantly, it was a bop.
Can we have a music-only version please? I love the narration but having just the visuals with music would be awesome for some occasions.
Where does þe heat come from to keep þe earþ molten for 500 million years? The sun surely can't play an important role, since we're living at ca 16° now, not 2000°. Is it all radioactive decay?
where did the water come from?
is that made with blenders grease pencil??
when will scientists ever actually prove earth is 4.5 billion years old?? (they never will because it isnt even close to that old)
I think I heard a Terraria song somewhere? 🥴
is that the one fish from half life 1 at 55:44?
Is there a way to make this available in youtube music, so I can listen to this while driving ?
What's the name of the song towards the end?
What is weird is why it took life so long to show up on Earth...
Is this music on spotify?? I would love to just listen to the music when I'm studying sometime
How in the world is this information collected? How do scientists create such a detailed account?
Not an expert here: If photosynthesis started in late Paleoarchean, how come there was no oxygen in the atmosphere during the Mesoarchean? Unless photosynthesis at the time worked differently than today? Or unless the oxygen was stuck in water? One would think over 100 million years, there would be plenty of O2 in the atmosphere.
Could this be made into a side scroller game?
At which point could humans survive on Earth , if they could go back in time?  I'm talking before before hunger became a factor.
Can you create one for History of mankind and different civilizations since the dawn of men?
Can we have a version without commentary? 🙏
This video is a banger through and through  Btw how's the camera lasts that long? what kind of technology the camera has? And who is the cameraman?
Love the channel and educational artworks the team of Kurzgesagt creates. I would love to give this to my kids, but their native language is Dutch. Is it possible you have an expert translate the most popular posters and infographs and present them in another language then English?
So did animals from Jurassic era survive or did everything go?
CHALLENGE!! WHERE IS GOD IN THIS VIDEO?? Can anyone, who believes in GOD or RELIGION, give an explanation about the presence or work of GOD in this entire video??
Making a 1 hour animated video is one thing, also adding entertaining and engaging music to match Damm!  Came for the video and stayed for the music, anyone??
How come no one is acknowledging this banger soundtrack??
when is the lofi study music channel coming?
It's pretty cool to see how much we've built in 5000 years compared to the huge amount of time the Earth has been existing, can't help but wonder how will everything look like in 10,000 years in the future if we don't destroy ourselves. (Or get destroyed? 👽)
How is this free
Does the narrator spit at 39:53?
When's the next update?
Why i can watch this video on PiP mode without YouTube premium?
What if time-traveling aliens seeded Earth with life a few billion years ago and they're periodically checking in to see if intelligence has emerged except they can't be bothered to set the time machine for every millennium because that would be like 3 million stops, so they just check in every 25 million years or so but they didn't expect apes to go from flinging poop to destroying their own planet so fast? From their perspective, they just watched a monkey eating a bug, pushed the button for the next stop, and oh no! Everyone's dead. They're like, Oh man! It's going to take forever for these irradiated cockroaches to do anything interesting. Push the button, Frank.
So if earth was just lava for that long… was it a star? Isn’t the sun just lava also?
We all are taught rains are formed due to the water cycle, water evapoarates from the ocean into the clouds and rains back into the ocean. Then how come in the Eoarchean period it rained for centuries?  Where did that water come from?
If this video took 5 years to make, in fractions of a second, how much time would that represent on the scale of 4.5 billion years =1 hour? It should be simple math but even with the help of AI my head is spinning trying to figure this out.  This is really a great video!   I wish I had room on my wall for some of those posters.
Apparently water could not exist without oxygen. Where did the water come from? Nearly midnight, prob had 1 too many j’s haha would love to hear insight tho.. ✌🏼
Where was the Roman Empire?
The amount of change humans have caused in that last second... hhhmmmm, what does that technically make us appear to be, I wonder?  We are truly effective at whatever it is we're doing here, that's for sure.
Is there a shorter version with all text narrator says? Because this one is showing scale properly I guess, but is quite boring to watch.
Small. I felt small. Was this all animated by hand?!
Hey Kurzgesagt, I can’t beat the first level of your VR game 😢 is this a skill issue?
I know you have way more english subscribers then german ones, but you’re a german channel. Could you at least upload in all languages at the same time instead of let us waiting so long for german videos? :(
What is with the sound track?! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I thought dinosaurs (and in small part mammals) mostly developed after the Permian-Triassic mass extinction since they had to compete much less over resources so some bipod species had time and space to evolve? I'm pretty sure there were no dinosaurs in the early Permian but oh well.
Is this FREE??? am i watching it for REAL??? ITS SO BEAUTIFUL... LOVE your TEAM EFFORT....❤❤👌👌
The floor is lava IS the worlds oldest game? 😂
I am asking for may 6 year old son: When is coming the german version of this brilliant video?
Can you please make a video about white holes ? I'm really curious to know what it is
Why did the Mesoarchean music sound like doom music? XD
How was there water if there wasn’t any oxygen yet in the atmosphere?
It's like watching the TV at the TV shop with just 15% commentary and people are still liking it??
isnt this mostly prehistory? I always thought that history starts where writing was invented
Why was oxygen needed for more complex life? Why couldn't life evolve with only CO2?
Are you gonna update this in a billion years?
think you could make a polish channel?
This is lovely! But what happened before the lava stage? How did the solar system start gathering lava rings to make planets?
Is there a version without the voice? Or at least a music version of this? This is excellent background audio/video for work, but voice can be distracting.
Could this video possibly be the longest animated sequence shot ever created? The Guiness Book needs to be consulted! 😎 (thank you for amazing work)
Why kurzgesagt videos can be viewed in the background with the yt app and others not?
34:00 which structure?
What kind of genre is the music for the Mesoarchean?  Cause it's metal af.  It's not quite djent, it's not synth.  I want it in my rotation but need to know what to look for.  Specific artist suggestions would be great.
Amazing!❤ But I have two questions: Why did the earth cool down and why did it start raining? Where did the H²O come from?
Can I get the background music track ID??
can you make a 4.5 billion year long video so i can watch everything unfold in real time?
Much hot and comfy?
I really enjoyed this!! Could you make that same style video for all of “Life’s History” and/or “Human History”?
noooo what happened to this channel? it used to be dope
Awesome video, as always!  Question: during the Hadean period , Earth was bombarded with asteroids. During the Eoarchean period , it rained  for millions of years. What is the origin of this water?
B-b-but where's my primordial SOUP!?   Jokes aside, really cool animation and education, thanks for sharing it with us
I wonder what the next 4.5 billion years will look like.
Who's here from Logically Explained?
How the hell is this free
What is the genre name of this type of music?
How the hell am i able to minimize this as a small screen while i cajt do this with any other yt video?
how can it rain when there's no water to form a cloud?
Can someone explain how it first started raining during the Eoarchean period? Where did this rain come from? Where did the hydration come from?
What? You're working in this from 2019? And still misses out on most of details, like how cells evolve and their internal structure and changing map of earth's continents, and remained silent most of that time and, displayed repeated animation for most of the time, really kurzgesagt isn't the same any more. 😢
Is cameraman pre-modern human? Because his patience and ability to not accelerate is legendary
22:49 is that a twister?
Anyone else blown away by the music?
Is there anyway to listen/purchase the audio only?
How did he fit so much time into an hour? That’s not how it works
Some reason youtube allows me on ios to watch this video in mini-player on home screen no premium is it because it’s one hour long?
what do you think about vsauce?
Wait.. we think life started, like, the SECOND it was possible? Like, floors not lava anymore and BAM?
All that time  - and I get to be on stage for 2 seconds? If I'd known that, I never would have auditioned.
Did you notice that at about 29:43, it glitches?
Can this kind of work (1 entire hour of animation) be done by AI in the future?
I just LOVE the soundtrack for the Mesoarchean, anyone know the name of the song?
Can I hit the like button 4.5 billion times?
Where all this rain in Eoarchean came from?
Where does the rain in the Eoarchean come from?
So how do I get ahold of these soundtracks?
@kurzgesagt Is the music from this available on Spotify?
why’s this dude yapping so much about how long it took for life to become “cool”? it’s mad annoying
How come I'm able to watch this video in a minimized window although I don't have YT premium?
So if the Earth's orbit changes speed and a year is one orbit...is "4.5 bil" years all 365 days long or is there a ratio/fluntuation calculated for?
Where can I get a playlist of the "sounds of earth"?
Where the holes at?
Are We There Yet : Remake Remix
Wouldnt evolution time of the earth go slower if the video was sped up?
Did you know that time passes slower the faster you move?
7:15 does that mean the "goldilocks zone" would of been more skewed towards Venus at this time?
Am I watching a Kurzgesagt video or am I playing Donkey Kong Country? Either way, great job!
is there a music and commentary free version? like only the sound effects and video?
How do ye come up with these ideas 👏 👏 👏
someone answer a quick question. . . how is there absolutely no oxygen in the environment when an ocean of H20 has existed for millions of years? should be quite a few ways for it to get split.
could have had more detail on the ottoman empire
I am too stupid not to know the answer to this but I had to ask. Are all the theories/science in this video shown is scientifically proven? or Its just a theory because it sounds logical.
on the 29:44 there is a visual glitch y?
history of the entire world i guess?
bro how do people dislike this? This is literally kurzgesagt for an hour. Love the work thats been put into this :)
Someone know the name of the ending music ?
Why is in the video top right corner written "million"? I'm confused...
Is this a parody of bill wurtz "history of the entire world, i guess"?
Can you make an option to choose audio with only music, without the commentary? I find the video and music great as a background for studying and/or working, but the commentary distracts me (even though I love it I'd appreciate an option to switch it off)
This video is amazing! 👏🏼 but could you add Spanish subtitles?, I'm from Mexico and I want to show this to my family 😭🫶🏼
Is this the reason the rest of their video ideas have been lackluster? or is it just the big corperate funding going to work?
Where did all the rain in the EOARCHEAN age come from?
I wonder how many meetings the gods had to have in order to get to the point where life finally was made, evolved and diversified.
yoooooo, can the next vid be another ant one? lol
For hundreds of millions of years there is nothing but lava and the  suddenly it rains for millions of years? Where did that water come from?
Who was in the Studio? They did a great Job
What is the song they used for the tonian period?
Could you do a history of centralized banking?
Hey wonderful work! Is there a way to have access to the music on any form? Spotify &/or Deezer?
Where did rain came from? Where did first organisms came from?
If this video consist of many animations stiched together, how they do it so smoothly? And if it’s actually one continous animation, just how big is the project file is?
1 hour Long Video? Oh Im watching all of That in one go😊
So God didn’t do all of this in 6 days and rested on the 7th? 😮
could you make a video with music only and background?
Can we also have a version without any comment? For a sublime experience.
I need a 4.5 billions years extended version.   Is it even possible to make a video so long?
*Question:* Would it be too financially damning to "open source" the animation/graphic files so that the community can add onto this? Maybe have an animation of the Earth's core actually growing? Add more animals and plants, perhaps with labels. Maybe make the video twice as long, but only 500k years per second.   Oh, hell, if you have the whole community contributing, why not make it enormous and do 10k per second?! (Too lazy to calculate how long the video would be.) And you could play around with acceleration (not sure how you'd "show" that), maybe for some periods keep it 1M per second, but during more interesting periods (and ones we know more about), make it even 5k per second.  Point being, is if it is actually feasible, it might be amazing to see what the community can add to this already astonishingly beautiful video.  My first thought as to why this _isn't_ possible/a good idea is because a lot of trademark stuff would make it out into the world and then the knockoffs start and you have to go all Disney on everyone. No one wants to do that, have that done to them, or have to hire the entire bar of lawyers (and have to pay them).  Still, one can dream.
if you dont mind me asking what is the song used in the mesoarchean?
How are meteor possibile when there was no Atmosphere?
I wonder where from big rainy clouds appeared in Eoarchean so they created all Earth’s oceans? Before that here was only lava… 🤔
when Godzilla is born?
how long did this take
Is this inspired by/in collaboration with the Deep Time Walk?
1 hour looks too long maybe 5 min better?
This 1 hour timeline was amazing. How about more videos like that but with details about each period?
Where did that first rain came from?
Can we have the none Audio and without the Top-Right text version of this video? it would be Fantastic Background video...
39:53 Is he spitting?
Do you have any videos on The Standard Model of particle physics?  or plans for making videos about it?
but how did first rain happen ?
Do i hear some influences from Extrawelt? 😍
Why this shit jamming
Towards the end there, the music seems to be a modified version of "The Human Era" - will that specific version be available anywhere to listen to soon?
Where does the rain come from in the Eoarchean? From the asteroids?
Where did all the rain come from? For the first millions years there was no rain and then suddenly it started raining. Was it because it was too hot for the water to condense into rain? This is a lot of water, and I don't think it could have all been hanging out in the sky as water vapour. Then the earth would have been completely covered in clouds.
This video must have took like… forever? 4.5 billion years i guess
No spoiler warning?
Hi Kurzgesagt. Is it possible to have this video as an app? Kinda like your "Universe in a Nutshell" app in the play and app store.
Uhm, the video is truly great, could you please upload a version without the narration so that I can better play it while working? Thank you very much!
So how does water suddenly appear in our atmosphere? That was the first part I was most interested in
very nice video, is there a version without music? only background effects and narration voice. I find the music too loud compared to the narrator voice
theres no way that nothing in this video is looped, right?
I wonder how much extra mass the earth gained from all the asteroid impacts over so many years, borh by water and rock.
Could we have version with voiceover ? just so i can put it in loop while i work ?  Amazing work, loved it <3
39:54 did the narrator just spit or am i tripping ?
is this a dream
9:00 can someone explain me where's the rain coming from?? It was all lava and it starts raining for millions of years like how?? Where all the water coming from
Can anyone pls let me abt the quality of their posters. Looking to buy one for my friend.
Why no sun (sunrise/set/any motion) in the hadean phase?
Can we start getting the intro back ?
And what about God?
So when do stands get introduced?
If you could understand how every current flowed, could you understand how every being thought?
Are your posters single paged?
bur when do the transformers arrive?
where is hallucigenia in Cambrian period? I want my First Titan.
Can we please get this on wallpaper engine
Im sorry I love these videos so much but this just left me with more questions like whare did the largest astrod hit? I know the one that took out the dinosaurs is around Mexico but what's this about the largest astrod?
Do they give out awards for best video of the year? If so everyone else who won it before needs to throw out their trophies because this surpasses them all. 🏆
This video is not exactly what I was expecting. Would it be asking too much to expect a something different every second for the entire hour of animation?
What Song Is That?
This video is too fast. Can you make it again, but in real time?
Was there a night during hadean period, and if so, would there be any igneous formations that would form and melt again in the additional morning heat, or was the whole spinny spinny day n night dance not a thing yet?
I know this is more of an experimental video and its very cool and all, but since animation is so expensive and it would be insane to make something less repetitive stretch out for a whole hour, then couldnt they have added some more narration? There is SO MUCH to talk about in each of those periods, feels like all that boring silence with bits of trivia in between for most of the runtime is kind of a waste of a great video idea idk
There seems to be a rendering glitch at 29:43?
Wait, if there was no oxigen in the atmosphere in the mesoarchean, how did it rain in the eoarchean if water is made of oxigen and hidrogen?
This is so cool! But why does it say “million year ago” at the top in the count down, when you are saying “Billion years ago”?
3:47 why did the music just randomly go hard?
Why is this 1 hour long video only 5 minutes long ?
am i the only one who thinks this is one of their least effort videos lately despite being 1 hour long? it is just a few animations looped over and over, not that it isn’t impressive, just not as much as their other videos in my opinion. Even the lake in the Orosirian period just loops over and over every few seconds
How do you know the sky was orange between 1'425'000'000 years ago and 1'015'000'000 years ago? 🤔
what about the polarian and hyperbolean epochs?
Why does the mesoarchean song sound like the doom theme😂
Am i the only one going through an existential, crisis because of this now?
Why did the music choreographer go so hard during the mesoarchean era 😭
can you upload a version of this with the commentary removed? the imagery and music alone are super chill and perfect for background noise
Can’t help noticing you say billion and in the upper right is written million. It’s a big difference. Which one is it?
why am I so late😢 i turn on notification to all but i was busy all that time i didn’t see this sooner when i was having difficulties day before yesterday
Maybe in the big picture, mankind will just be another "whats that?" in the timeline.
can you please upload a version with more environmental sound effects and music but without commentary?
34:00 why did you mention the asteroid but didnt display it?
How does this exist FOR FREE??
Does the narrator spit at 39:54?
why is no one talking about how fire the soundtrack is??
32:41 Did the team purposely made the middle lane of the video slide by faster? It is messing with my perspectives that further away objects should move less pixels than closer... And my eyes are bleeding.
I am curious how do we know the exact stages of earth and its condition? is it from deep layer of ice in antartica?
I only counted 3 mass extinction events i thought there were 5  The 1 after the cambrian  The great dying in pre the Triassic The one they killed the dinos where did i miss two?
Is there a version without the narrator? I could totally see myself putting this in the background in a TV hanging out with friends
What did we do to deserve an hour long video from kurzgesagt. Thank you for your outstanding work!!
I'd love to have this as my wallpaper. Is someone able to do it on Wallpaper Engine??
In the middle of the video you shown rain again, was it raining alot of those millenia like in the beginning of the video?  Why didn't you show the moon more through its dynamic changes? Missed opportunity.
My only complaint is that there wasn’t a kurzgesagt birb hidden somewhere in the animation…      …Or was there? (Have fun with that thought)
I love this video ! I am currently at the 1 billion mark and I have 1 question: how long did it take you to animate this?
Are we not gonna talk about how kickass this music is???
why there's a random glitch at 29:43
Why did you keep showing the same scenes over and over? It was boring. But I can't say it wasn't educational. Anyway, good job 👍
Can you do a version with no speech at all ?
i love it. can we have video like that with out commentary and just this chilling vipe musics :) like sunsystem  in 60 min universe in 60min and and and ?? :)
Did you get tool to write the soundtrack to this?
Why just earth and moon aren't merging... Because they seem so close..
Where does God play a role in all this?
Can we please get a download link for this? I want to put this on screen at some places, where internet is a bit tricky, and a direct link from the beamer to YT isn't possible.
How did rain come suddenly?
2:12 why is the moon si big ij the background?
can somone make a wall paper
How long to edit
I’ve got a question for any of you passers by in the comments: If you could live in any time period pre-civilization, which would it be? You’d still be human, by the way.
You've been working on this since 2019?!?! AKA 4 years ago??
is there a way in which we can collaborate with this animation, by example: doing some animations for the hadrean and eoarchean and the complexity of chemichal processes that were happening
How oxygen existed at that time? 1:30
In Mesoarchean if there's water on the surface and steaming water on top shouldn't there be hydrogen and oxygen in the atmosphere from the breakdown of water?
When I start doing something with this in the background I focus so much I don't even hear what the narrator said, just a few seconds later I'm like "did he said something new?" and I have to rewind it to see if I missed something. My brain just can't focus on both at the same time lol
The music is great! Who made it?
Can we get the music please?
Do you want to watch incredible videos?
but out of what did earth get born?
wha??? Kurzgesagt is celebrating the 10th anniversary???😱Gosh makes me feel like I am a grandma🥲
Why are the clouds diagonal?
Is that Terraria music around 52 minutes in?! Hahaha
i wonder if we went around the world
Will there be a version with only bagground music?😅
WHO was in the studio???????  Edit: Since 2019 is crazy, this is a special video <3
Please can you release a version without the speech? Of course love the speech and the learnings there, but the music / visuals are also great for background during work. Would be amazing <3
Anyone else heard terraria soundtrack?
Can you guys make a video explaining human evolution from start to now? Like from the first microorganism, to the first multi-celled organism, the first time an organism saw it fit that it needed a partner and genders evolved, the first time a creature evolved eyes, and taste and why that would have had to happen, how the subtle differences that define evolution go unnoticed for generations etc…
Does anyone know what the soundtrack at 58:47 is called?
WHO THE HELL PUT INTERMISSIONS INTO SPONSORBLOCK????? STOP. THE WHOLE POINT IS TO WATCH THE TIMELAPSE
Can you release this as Screensaver/Desktop Background for Windows / macOS? ❤
How can i get the background music?
But where is moon, and how moon formed??!!
Are we there yet?
Could you guys do a video on the history of all humanity? I know its a bit different from the regular content but I feel like it would make history so much more interesting for a lot of us.
So if we put 4.5 billion years in 1 hour,humans just existing  less than a minute?
I got a question. If one million years passed in this video and animation is usually around 25 frames a second what numeric value in fractions of a frame of animation is a human life aged from birth to 80 years old???  A bit of nerd power please here.   A fun perspective of insignificant value
Would the animating or the research be the most time intensive task?
2019!?! Damn 4 years!
How? How did you make me commit to what so early on shows to be a looooot of waiting?
WHEN DID MITOCHONDRIA BECAME THE POWERHOUSE OF CELL?
And we got this gor free??❤
HOW DO I SET THIS AS MY WALLPAPER??
Ok. Who will be the mad lad that turns this video into a wallpaper in Wallpaper Engine? I'm waiting
Anyone else get a glitch at 29:43?
How is it that I was able to watch this entire thing without a single ad?
I need this music... can it be bought or downloaded anywhere?
they CUSTOMED CAPTIONED THIS!?
Honest question, where did the water come from? it was super hot lava with meteor showers then it started raining and that wasn’t really explained.   I’m guessing our water comes a little from the rogue planet, a little from the meteors, and most of our water was formed (and maybe still is forming in a continuous process) within our Earth. Some process that science could prove, but no mind could imagine, it must be seen.
What exactly caused all the rain after the lava evolution?
Did I hear a bit of doom slayer in the background music during the Mesoarchean?
What about the boredom encompassed in those 4.5 billion years?
Why does the Mesoarchean music go so hard?
where is your ad money?
Was the moon tidally locked from day one? I understand some artistic license is necessary for the time lapse (it doesn't rise or set either), but a spinning moon would have been an interesting thing to see since it's not our usual experience.
Why is the landmass with soil in orosirian period but is covered with mountains in calymmian period
Millions of years of heavy rain to form the oceans.... But where did all this water came from in the first place? Nice work tho 😅
scrubbing through the time bar, the ediacaran happens that late?? what in the shit
Is the sun a deadly laser?
Fantastic video. Very zen music accompaniment. I do have a question: Was the choice to show most dinosaurs without feathers borne out of wanting to stick to the common image that the layman has of dinosaurs, because how the feather coverage was unsure, or because the science is still out? Or was there some other reason?
Is that Doom I hear in the Mesoarchean..? 😂
I blinked. What did I miss?
What stopped all the water from evaporating when it was still "extremely hot"? Intense pressure?
From where hundreds of years of continued rain without atmosphere  ?
Why does the soundtrack for this video sound straight out of Payday 2? Starbreeze, get in this! Also Amazing video!
Please could you release this as a windows animated wallpaper? :-) Fantastic video btw :-)
During the Cryogenian, could microbes simply have went into stasis due to the cold ? Could this example the survival of life ? Or life perished in all but the warmest areas during the Cryogenian period?
Do a 5 min all of history of what earth looks like from orbit/moon!
i dont like this why u do this like that boring??
Why is this an hour long there's so much of the same thing
But where does god come in?
I tried to aleep to this, but the music is annoying. Can you guys do a version with calmer music?
19:55 Does the Mesoarchean Djents?
Does every employee from Kurzgesagt get to pick a birb as avatar?
Has anyone seen any Easter eggs in this?
Can we get a version where there is no voice over? The voices get a bit distracting while having this on another monitor. And I would like to hear just the music with the effects if that is possible.
The fireballs/asteroid/meteor took million of years to drop? How slow were they?
But can it blend?
No word of mass extinction of life due to all then toxic oxygen byproduct of new bacteria and the induced ice age?
Mesoarchean album drop when? Holy crap this goes hard.
Did anyone else catch how every beat of the music was 1 million years?
Would you consider make something like that while adding some commentary? It would be cool! :)
Okay but how did you guys make it so if I leave the app the video window is still open? I thought that's an exclusive youtube premium thingy?
Could you guys please make a vid about lately extint animals?🙏
10 hour version when?  Serious question - can we have a 10 hour version?
The past had some sick beats as background music. I wonder where those went?
Earths history to sleep to?
You guys do realise that they used a Time Machine to go back, set up some cameras, and used a cartoon filter for this video?
Has it really only been 10 years? I feel like I'm watching your videos forever already. Much much thanks to all those amazing videos you brought out over the years. I loved every single one of them! <3
where did all the water came to form the rain?
When Moon is made of Earth, why it doesn't contain water and atmosphere in the same form? Did the Earth's gravity suck all the water vapor and atmosphere from the Moon?
Did they really have such good music in the past
I don't undestand how mamals were made. Can anyone explain pls?
Am I just blind or is the track starting at 56:52 not in the Epic Mountain soundtrack release? Thanks for any help.
I wonder how long the whole strip would be, that slides past in the video. That would be a nice poster! Edit.: Calculated it: It takes about 12 seconds for a screen to slipe past. in one Hour that makes 300 screens. With my normally sized computer monitor, that makes a strip about 120m long.
does this soundtrack get uploaded on spotify ?
So the question still exists, what dying planet did we come from?
I wonder how large the memory card they used to record 4.5 billion years worth of footage. The editing team did a great job fast forwarding the footage and condescending to an hour
Why wasn't the asteroid impact at 33:49 shown, I wanna see it!
How much did the production of this video cost?  And how many project hours were spent? A ballpark estimate.
This is absolutely insane. The beautiful animation and music. But tell me… why am I crying? Why did this video make me so emotional???
Who is the DJ that survived 4 billion years? He's amazing!
would the initial photosynthesis sea be green and not purple? I thought it was purple first, then green won out somehow...
A hour long animation?????
@thebibleproject @catholiclofi Can we get a Salvation History version of this? Genesis -> Present
How about 4.5 billion years in 30 minutes next time?
Do you have a Spotify link with the audio?
Anyone from 3719million years ago here?
@kurzgesagt how much time did this video take?
What happanes at 2352 (29.44)? Is this a glitch or did something happened so fast it was not noticable?
How many years did your team spent making this
Can u guys do more about the immune system plz
Can we just appreciate how awesome the music is
Where did all the water come from?
Where’s the part about the sun being a deadly laser?
Am I the only one who read the tittle in his voice?
7:19 interesting linguistic... quirk. A.I. script? TTS? Most curious
Why does it feel like you guys are going to stop making videos for some reason?
How many hydrothermal vents were there in the Paleoarchean!?
Why was I not engaged with the long pauses of dialogue- the animation certainly was a lot of work. However, there needs to be more work put into what’s being said the music’s not that entertaining to listen to for 20 minutes between talking.
Oh so its just a looped video that changes slides?
Question at what point was ozone layer created?
Someone still wana explain how this big animals just randomly appeared? And all of these fish and insects? Nah, I don’t buy it 😅
What's the music around the Cretaceous? Is it still unreleased? The choral part is the best!
Could you make a version of this, but with only music and the effects that happen in the video?
Does anyone else get really ugly gradient banding/posterising in places like 14:00? Is that youtuber's encoder baking it into the video? Really a shame that it ruins the artistry of this video
Havent the Earth turned purple for a while cuz of retinal?:D
Amazing video from all perspectives! ❤ Thank you so much for this huge work!  P.S. How much time did it take to save? 😸
what happended to the narators voice? Something's off..
Other species came way earlier than human species but why only humans became so advanced in evolution?
Who else thought that the music in the background was quite banger?
What did just happen??? That's crazy.....thank you guys so much!!!!
remember history of the earth i guess ?, i miss that video
5:50 is that a Dollar General ?
What caused the mass freeze in the cryogenian?
You didn't mention god for some reason?
I know this is not a history channel, but could you PLEASE do one for human history?
Why did it start raining tho? and for so long as well. Where did all this rain/water came from 🤔
Anyone else really getting a feeling to play Spore again?... Really great video, good music too! :D
what does it mean life begins enter the stage? it existed somwhere in space and just entered earth when it bacame suitable?
what's the point of all our sufferin, when we're barely an insignificant sneeze in the history of existence?
Is it just me or does Mick Gordon take over the music in at 19:40 ?
Can you do one without music?
Why is the music SO GOOD I swear
Love the video, but whats with the invent instead of evolve. Am i to stupid or os this simulation theory stuff ?
In which program do you make your animations?
I wonder, wouldn't the stars in the sky change rapidly during such timescales?
Since 2019?? Then I wonder how many times they had to "redo" the art and animation because it looks like a normal high quality video from today! 🤔😁  ps: I love the credits-soundtrack!!!! 1:01:48
IS THIS FREE???
Wait im confused was the water that rained in the eoarchean era a different kind of water before oxygen formed in Siderian era?
But who delivered the first waters?????
Where did all the greenhouse gases go in the Sederian? Couldnt we do the same now?
Does anyone know a similar channel than this.
37:11 can anyone elaborate on that one a little? tried goolgling but dont seem to be able to find what im looking for or have overlooked it
can you tell how the first cell came to life?
Can we please get a version of this without the music? I wanna play my own music over this when I study :3
37:07 Wait, what?
I wonder if any of the made up gods that people believe in were around at the beginning of the video 🤣🤣🤣
If this cannot be called art, what is art?
what ? why period of large mushrooms that ruled the earth was skipped ?
Is it just me or the some parts of the music is suitable for a shopping mall
you havent really showed anything, mostly just surface, what about primordial organisms n stuff? my god
i wonder why people with sponsorblock marked like half of the video as filler not as attack on the video but like why would they see around half of the video as filler
I didn’t know it took so long for the Earth’s core to form. Were the magnetic fields (etc.) different before this or was the physical form of the core irrelevant for these?
Does anyone know ehy the Calymmian, Ectasian and Stenian ages had so many diagonal blurry clouds by the mountains? I feel like there’s some cool reason behind it
at what point was earth livable? like you can go out and not die due to lack of oxygen?
Just out of curiosity, what's the earliest period we think we could time-machine a current human to and think they'd have a relatively good chance of survival (temperature, atmosphere, food and water wise)?
Bro Wth, 1 hour of animation?! Is this a movie? >_> Amazing!!
There was a question in earth science exam. How long each Era takes in the several hours of Documentary? Suppose that ratio of time is proportional to actual time ratio of actual geological Era. I thought that who will watch this boring documentary, but I'm watching it now.
When does the album drops? 👀
Were colonies of precursor Corals the first "multicellular animals"? Sticky sludges of something basking in warm sea currents under a dappled sunlight.
Can you expand it to a three-episode miniseries about the history of the universe?
Can we  get more vids like this? But then how humankind develops.
Also who is responsible for this awesome music??
I don't why would people dislike this?
Besides the animation, can we talk about the music??? Nearly an hour of bangers
I'm the only one? Even if I don't have yt premium this video keeps playing in PiP mode on my iPhone...
Is it me or a few minutes into the mesoarchean The music sounded like Doom or something like that cuz the guitar lmao
Is this Kurzgesagt's own attempt at a "History of the Entire World I Guess"?
can we have a shorter, compressed version of this? with all the silent parts cut out?
a 1 hour long fully edited video? dear jesus
We have all this animation for free ? I think I'll put it as my wallpaper once I have a desktop pc.
Was the transition from lava lake to solid ground really that fast in correlation?
Can we get PC wallpapers from the differend eras? I thought that the Hadean era looked so cool but I don't want to ruin it by editing the text out by myself
why wasnt i jamming to the backgroud music and waiting for the beat drop,good job on this video
Is there an audio only version on Spotify? If there isn't. There should be.
Why the dance club noise?
How much did this video cost?
WHERE DID THE RAIN COME FROM?!
How many of you immediately thinked about Bill Wurtz?😂
HOW DO YOU HAVE THIS MUCH PATIENCE FOR ANIMATIN?
Did I just miss the tardis or it hasn't been in the video?
how can you present the hadean era as volcanic, hot hell while acknowledging the zircons found from that time? the evidence of liquid water directly contradicts the past theory of hellish burning earth!
How as almost nobody mentioned the excellent soundtrack? The music rocks!
is this procedurally generated?
The music is awesome in this, a 1 hour set of _Kurzgesagt beats to relax/study to_ basically. Is this on Spotify/Apple Music/Tidal?
Does this mean  mammals are anti-meteorites?
Can we have this as a wallpaper engine wallpaper???
Is there a glitch at 29:43? I am fairly certain it is not my computer.
29:44 Anyone else catch these occasional glitches throughout the video or is it just my monitor? I think there's something bigger than just 4.5 billiom years condensed to an hour. But then again, I might just be too deep in the indie ARG community to just not think anything out of the ordinary is a minor mistake.
Whats the song during Hadean ?
Wow. Amazing video. Still can’t figure out where the first millions of rain came exactly from 🫣 it was just there? 🤯
If I pause the video will it pause time?
I wonder what excuse can anyone use to hate on kurzgesagt?
Wurtzgesagt? ah, no jingles tho.
Are there plans to make this into a downloadable live wallpaper? Or segmented into multiple, like one for each era? It'd be really neat to have on an idle desktop
what about when the ocean became red before the huronian ice age?
script writers had a day off? or?
Bangiomorphia Pubescens - the name for the algae that invented sex - really scientists? Really?
Can this win the YouTube award for best YouTube on YouTube, please?
19:57 anyone else think the music here sounds like Dream Theater a little? like it belongs in Octavarium or something
How many MYA did they start animating this? 🙂 Love the soundtrack, this is brilliant!
Why doesn't the top counter day billions of years it just says 5 million years
What a ride. I can see why this would have taken so long. Will we persist or are we doomed to be a blip on the geological radar? Only time will tell
Has anyone else watched this twice already?
anyone else notice something weird with the perspective of the tonian era?
Is it me? Or does the music sometimes sounds like a Terraria music
Shouldn't the stars be moving perceptivly in the background?
Algae and colar reefs at least?? 53:38
Do we know why it freezes then unfreezes? 52:40
If there is no O2 in the early stage of the earth, how can it filled with so much water? where are those water came from?
Someone explain to me where the rain came from!? It went from lava to rain falling… from what source!!!!?
Part 2 when?
How long did it take you to make this, also i'm listening to this when I go to bed
You thought we would leave the video while we do other things instead of watching it all up close? Oh you silly
And what does that "self-sustaining" nuclear reactor did to the Earth? How did it changed for example the climate or life?
I like the video. Is there a part 2 in the making?
26:18 YOU THINK I WOULDNT NOTICE THAT THEY (the dots on the screen) TELEPORTED?
How did only this video beeb able to turn on picture on picture mode?
Did anyone else get a glitch at 29:45?
Why is nobody talking about the soundtrack???  Nice 4/3 polyrhythm
Am I the only one vibing to the background music?
Could you upload a version without commentary, just music? It would be a fantastic background video for classrooms and such
Why does this guy sound like the fitness gram pacer test guy
Really? All this for free??
54:09 does that happen to be the marvelous breadfish?
Can you do a version of this but narrowed down to something like just human history? It'd be really cool.
New risk of rain soundtrack dropped?!
Wait how is there no oxygen in the air before and at Mesoarchean but theres water ?  Amazing animation by the way
You didn't reproduce the night sky to reflect the moving of stars? Disappointed.
Yet the question remains, who was playing that music all that time?
wasnt there a dark stage after the dinosaur asteroid?? how did mammals survived it or how did they surged?
I can't remember what the soundtrack is called at 58:40 can someone let me know? I've heard it before and loved it.
How did Kurzgesagt forget that the Great Oxidation event caused the first mass extinction in Earth’s history?
is it Dream Theatre on the BGM? 🤣
39:53 did he just spit into the mic? o.o
Can someone explain why earth freezed during cryogenian period.
I don’t understand why the rain happened…it went from lava to rain…why?
Nearly all of human existence took place in the last frame. What will the next frame look like?
Any thoughts about Cardven Token? I myself think its the best thing since sliced bread.
Any thoughts about Cardven Token? I myself think its the best thing since sliced bread.
Kurzgesagt, when will be aviable in your shop this awesome soundtrack?
What is the name for this theme 59:00?
how they have cool music back then? 0.O
Can we get the soundtrack, please.
if you skip ahead in a video, isnt that considered time travel?
can someone tell me where i could find the captions(i mean like the script) for this? I want it for a writing project.
why did all the asteroids come in in one direction?
what, 1 hr??? really shocked
can someone confirm i think the music on 26:15 is from the movie bubble i think its a remix but it is exactly the same.
1 hour video? We eating good!👍
8:38 why is it only "probably"? Do we have a concrete evidence for that? where did all the water come from?
When did i buy YouTube Premium?
can we please get a full soundtrack without commentary, the music was great in on its own
How AMAZING would a Kurzgesat video game be??
how did you know all this?
Is there a version without narration?   This video is a vibe.  Thank you for your efforts!
ya ok but what are ur sources?
Play in the background while I work? No thank you I’ll be staring at this beautiful animation for the next hour thanks 😂
Do you remember any of it? That's how long eternity is going to feel after we're gone.
Is it possible to subscribe twice? I appreciate and see how much time and effort this took to make and this is so awesome! You guys rock!
Anywhere we can listen to the music track?
Did anyone else pause it to see if their tap was dripping? Haha  Great vid... again, and always.
could you upload a version without any dialog? I really enjoyed just watching the scenery just go past with the epic music, and having an hour straight of that I think could be very relaxing. extremely cool video though, you people never cease to amaze me with your incredible writing, art and animation.
So you skipped abiogenesis? or I missed this part?
Where did you get the music?
What was the nuclear reacton on the Rhyacian period?
Did the moon experience similar monsoons as it cooled?
Can anyone tell me name of instrumental song used in it?
24:36 was the bacteria looking for spices?
How long did this video take to render?
1+ hour ?! I'll watch later. 😅
could you release the uncompressed video file this would be great to have as a desktop wallpaper, great video btw
Where did all the water come from that fed the rain during the Eoarchean? Was the atmosphere made of steam before?
Time machine schematics reveal when?
So, when can we expect the music for this video to drop as a standalone product?
If life formed so quickly why are we certain all life is descended from the same initial cells?  Why wouldn't it have arisen many times?
Is there a non-narrator & music version of this video? Seems really chill to just play it in the monitor while doing work and just listen to the sound of nature
wait the meteors at the start of the video take several million years to fall?
How does a channel like this start the video showing human era is only 12000 years old? Are ya serious mate? Humans have been here for atleast 100,000 years. We've carbon dated ancient architecture and mummies to 50,000 years+ ago
Why is no one talking about the invention of sex in 44:52?
This music is insanely good. Who on the kursgesagt team wrote it? Give them a raise NOW
Can we please get a version of this video with no commentary? Its perfect for study and would mean no interruption during the writing process. The perfect visuals and such a gorgeous soundtrack
Who cooked up these fire beats?
How do they like, get these time estimates? Like how did they calculate the Hadean took that long ?
Incredibly well done. Amazing. Brilliant. Could anybody tell me whose music is that OST? Beautiful… words fail me.
What part when the Great Oxidation event happened when the oceans turned red?
Gotta ask, how much to the audio team cheer when this video idea was proposed?  Because they went all out and it comes through beautifully!
What would happen if you dropped a nuke into hurricane?
Could you please make this video again, but in real time?
Do you think you could make this an animated wallpaper, i think it would be really cool!
Fun video! Has Kurzgesagt considered making long-form documentaries (if they have made them in the past, are they pay-walled on something like Nebula)?
Ok but why does 20:15 go so hard? Can a lot of this music be put on Tidal for that nice hifi enjoyment?
how did this get animated? This is some amazing content!
I didnt understand how we got plants and forest on the ground?
The diagonal clouds look like a mistake? 42 min in!
Why do we live, why do we die? We are nothing but a fever to this planet.
In the Eoarchean phase, how did that first rain happen? Where did all that water come from?
what is that thing on the background 9:49
20 years ago, solid.  Now? There is more. There is better. For example, emphasize the "visibility" part of the Cambrian Explosion: all the diversification happened before, but now "shells" become a thing so we can "see" in the fossil record.
This music is seriously so good. Is there a way to get a playlist?
Is it just me or does anyone else get nostalgic and a little sad about the life that you have missed like living with the dinosaurs and throughout of of the history of life
At 29:43 the screen glitches a bit, is anyone else getting this?
What is your first ever video
Yo, who gave the mesoarchean era a djent song?
How could the climate have changed so much so long ago? Humans weren't even around!
Cryogenian - how life survived? Maybe thx internal thermal vulcanos under water.
Did you guys employ any AI-generative tools, like image generators or language models, in the making of this video? If so, in what ways did you guys use it? And for what purpose? And why?
how did water came on the planet? it was lava, then x happens and it raned??? how
I hope I'm not the only one who really enjoys the music part of this? Actually enjoyable and calming in a way!
Did i just spend an entire hour watching earth's history at 1 AM?
Can we just appreciate the animation team for making an animation an hour long?
What's the ideal animated show to enjoy while on the treadmill?
Wait, correct me if i'm wrong but, didn't the oceans turned red at a point ? Because of suspended iron in the water oxydazing due to the creation of oxygen by cyanobacteria ?
39:54 Why he spitting on us?
CAN WE JUST EKNOWLEDGE THE AMAZING SOUND DESIGN? these tracks enhanced this experience to a 100000000
@kurzgesagt what was the piano music at the very end of the video? Thanks :)
Where did the water of the Eoarchean come from?
Was that a Homo Erectus at the end there?  It's hard to tell in the style...
6:49 it fidnt actually take a remnant of theia millions of years to fall to earth did it? The metor falling animation is on a different time scale?
Animated Desktop Backgrounds soon? 🥹
not to complain, this is super cool, but can we also have a version without the VO pls?
How were they able to animate all of this?
how the diggity dog did they animate an hour's worth of history
Can someone explain how rain just started During Eorchian?
How does nobody give credit to the absolute banger music?? I let this run as i cooked and just started dancing in the kitchen
cannabis vaporizer existance is how long in this time scale?
Was wondering why meteors had trails of fire if there was no atmosphere, then heard we had a co2 atmo.... Gg.
Is there a music free version of this with just the sound effects and narration?
Great work Kurzgesagt, music is well thought too. But why not make the timeline logarithmic?
a whole HOUR long? what did we do to deserve this. y'all are amazing
Have scientist discovered why every couple hundred million years earth turned into a Google Pixel ad?
Where can I nominate this for Best Music Video of the Year 12,023?
Volcanic rock can float...is that what we are seeing during the early Eoarchean?
hey guys.. excellent video.. i just have one question and i would be thrilled if you can answer. WHEN IT FIRST RAINED IN THE EOARCHEAN PERIOD, WHERE DID THE WATER COME FROM OR HOW WAS THE FIRST WATER FORMED?
This is amazing! I want to ask for an eventual sequel (maybe for your 20th anniversary?) that's the entire history of the universe in an hour, except that instead of all the action being packed into the last 25%, it'd be more like the last 8%. What about a logarithmic version, where early time passes more quickly and things slow down near the present? Or would that defeat the point?
Enjoying the soundtrack 🙂 Much hot and comfy...?😂
how much time did these animators spend in total on this one project? huge props to the animators
am i the only one who added this to his favourites before even watching it?
Can I work for you?
I still didn’t grasp how long that was, could you make an animation that lasts 4.5 billion years?
29:43 Anyone else notice the glitch at the bottom of the screen here? Graphics card failing during original video render perhaps?
@kurzgesagt Can you post another version of this with the music but no voiceover?
Where can I acquire this soundtrack?
how is this amount of quality free?
its still much hot and comfy?
Anyone else wanna see them make a part 2?
Just wondered, maybe stupid question, but in the cryogenian wenn all of the earth froze, you said that we were not sure how life survived? But how do we know that it didn’t restart after? Maybe DNA is more common then what we might believe?
have you ever heard of wallpaper engine? it would take forever to download, but this should be on there
How did it rain for millions of years? How did water get to the earth?
anyone catch the visual glitch at 29:43?
Is there a version of this without the narrator?
why do you keep on posting videos right after i have a test with the same subject 😩
This took you guys 4 years to make for real?
Did he really leave me for 200 million years to let me think about whether he said "much hot" on purpose?!
now the question is: have they hidden a duck in here?
Now the real question is, how many times did the camera go around the whole earth during this whole video?
i have a question . how would life be on earth if we had a moon the same size (maybe even same conditions ) as our earth ? will life still exist ? will this moon have life on it ? will our gravity be lighter ? or higher ? and many other scientific questions   please upvote this comment so maybe we can have a video about it some day :)
Can someone explain this to me, why are there floating rocks in the beginning of the Rhyacian Period?
is this free copy rigth music ?
Where did that lava, earth, water and everything come from? Hmm?
How do I make this my wallpaper
Happy 10 Years Kurzgesagt!   BTW am I the only one here who can't stop thinking of Terraria while listening to this video's music? 😅
Q & a what’s, the history of the world? Once upon a time we’re on a giant rock floating in space we still are.
Has Greta seen this?
Do we know where the first rain and first cells originated from?
There has to be at least some inspiration from the Terarria soundtrack right??? This is so groovy and soothing!
how has nobody pointed out that the music is made like all of the other videos, where its entirely dynamic, BUT FOR THE ENTIRE HOUR, from the bubbly underwater to the dry surface, it all changes along with the video. they realllllly didnt take any shortcuts at all with making this
Did Kurzgesagt really drop a 1 hour video?! Christmas came early this year.
Shouldn't the first photosynthesizers cause a purple hue? No oxygen and all.
What type of video is this?
i got really emotional at the end lol . . .  i can TELL it was loads of work....woould you ever do a history of the universe one?
AN HOUR LONG KURZGESAGT VIDEO?!? What is it, my birthday or something?
When can we get the soundtrack on vinyll? 😉🎶💿
Where is the soundtrack release!?
How good is this music.
Is it possible to get a screen saver version of this?!
Is this playlist online somewhere?
58:08 WAIT, do I have a dirty mind, or was that a joke about "vögeln"? Sneaky germans
how do we know all this stuff?
can we have an version of it without the narrator? like with just the music and sound effect !!
Where’d the water come from?
Great video but can we talk about how good the soundtrack is????
Is this a compilation of dozends of old videos or is it all new?
Where did the water that raised come from?
I still have so many questions: How did the earth when it was a ball of fire form? Where did all the water come from when it began to rain?
my friend added this to his sex playlist???????
Bill Wurtz, finally, outdone..?
I want to put this in a frame!  Can you give us a making-of, please? How do you animate an hour long pan? Procedural vector engine? Generative AI? Elbow grease 😱? All three possibilities are super impressive.
Question: Did Earth always have a magnetic field?
I always wondered why the ages closer to modern day are shorter. is it because things continued to speed up and changes are happening faster? Or is it simply humans can see things that happened closer to modern day easier and can better divide up the ages?
Before i dedicated 1 hr of my life to this video, is this just multiple videos previously made in one video or a brand new video?
Can anyone explain why the sun got darker during the Hadean phase
At 8:30, It begins to rain? Where did the rain come from? Isn't rainwater water that has condensed from the evaporation of water on the earth's surface? Even if there was some water from the surface, it would be a finite amount.
didnt vsauce do that at the end of one of their videos?
Is the music available as a download?
Who else watched the whole video?
How do we know that the music people at Kurzgesagt didn't just have an hour long jam session and the others just went "lets put some visuals over this"
Anyone else getting high while watching this?
1 hour long Kurzgesagt video? Is this real? 😮🎉
Who were the idiots that disliked this amazing video?
45:00 what was invented?
Would it be possible to get a version with no words or music, just the ambient noises?  Thanks much and we’ll done!
Why isn't this in a podcast in Spotify?
From where comes the water that fills the oceans with water at the eoarchean phase?
Why is Kurzegesagt shocking us each time with some level of quality content that we previously thought was impossible to achieve AND FOR FREE !!!!!!!
Damn animating a 1 hour video?
Who else skipped a few millions years? 😂
where did the rain come from?  I thought Earth was hit with ice comets for millions of years.  We need clouds first before we have rain
Can we ponder a bit that at this speed the sun / moon is perfectly in sync?
Can you do the human history in 1 hour?
Is there any way you make is available to download in HDR please ?? 😃 I would love to have it boucle on my TV in the background like a gallery display  Also for the 20 years, can we have the same but with what the FUTURE could look like, either one where end is destroyed, or one when it continue in space
how do the asteroids stay in the same place for thousands of years?
Kurzgesagt uploads an hour-long video on my birthday? Best gift ever.  Also, what is this 🔥 track?
Can we get a video with the music and visuals without the talking over too?
When might we see an episode that covers all of human history from our earliest ancestors to today?
YOU MADE A KURZESAGT MOVIE?!?!😂😂 FOR FREE??? THANK YOU KURZESAGT TEAM ❤️🙏❤️🙏❤️
Did the music get more and more emotional toward the end or is it just me? Also props to everyone who has been working on this since 2019❤.
Neoarchean underwater scene is blue colored?  Shouldn't the underwater light from above in the sky be in some other color before oxygen appeared in the scene?
I got lost somewhere in the video so I’m lost IN time. Do I just go back to the beginning or start somewhere random?
Great video! amazing, is there an album in spotify with only the songs? I'll like to hear them is great background music
Can we get a track upload for the Rhyacian period? Its too good 30:50  Edit: 11 months later and still waiting for that Rhyacian track to drop please 😅
Any chance you guys release a version with no narration and only music + sfx?
Wow, you guys have been on this project since 2019? That was the year I opened my channel up! Congrats for finishing this project in time for your 10th anniversary!
Where do i pay the money this deserves?
Which song is in the paleogene?
How did the Plants "create" soil?
What is the piano music at the end?
Who put doom music in the Mesoarchean era?
How does one invent sex?
Can they also explain how is the ocean salty?
I don't even have enough mobile internet data to watch this in Full HD 😢 how did they even make this well researched (I assume) & incredible looking (I assume) Animated 1hr long video?!
does anyone know if they have a spanish channel with this video ? i want to show this to my kids
A 1h long kurtz video ?! Holly sweet potatoe !
Is this the longest Kurzgesagt video ever made?
I have a doubt regarding the Eoarchean period, and it is that it started to rain when the planet began to cool, and if (as far as I know) rain is formed from the evaporation of water, and if the planet was so hot, ¿How did rain occur in the cooling process? PD: I love all the work they have done to create this high quality animated video, the effort put behind this is truly admirable.
anyone else see the doctor who reference?
Who clicked thinking Bill Wurtz was back on the menu?
How do i make this my wallpaper?
Could you release a version of this without the commentary? Commentary is great, but having an alternate version for background stuff would be awesome.
WE GET THIS MASTERPIECE FOR FREE???? IT FEELS ILLEGAL.
Does the iron core "crystal" that forms around 42:30 maybe help life to evolve? Is this when the magnetosphere would form? Helping shield evolving life from harmful radiation?
future me, was this video worth it? (im in the Hadean era)
19:50 What is this music? Did doomguy apper on earth?
This is insane, very slow claps.   Btw can you share what music plays during the Orosirian period? i just really like it lmao
Is there any reason why all the meteoroid impacts in the Hadean were all generally coming from the same direction, or was it just artistic license?
Who else watched this at 2x speed?
How many times may I hit the like button?
I'm sorry but this video is flawed in a few ways.  The grammatical error by the narrator near the end of the first section. The fact that you have 4.5 billion years of information available but can't fill an hour video with dialog, leaving incredibly long gaps of "dead air"(ignoring the music) but, on the music, why is this music the same type used in videos meant to be played as background noise? It makes it impossible to pay attention to the entire video without missing quite a lot of the sparse dialog because you're zoned out since it's been over a minute since anything but generic music was playing.  I understand that you wanted to put the time line in perspective. But this video could have sped up the time line to match the amount of time that the narrator was speaking about each era, cutting out all the unnecessary "dead air". Or.. all dialog could have been cut and this could just have been a screen saver.. trying to do both takes away from both.
Is this the video that finished Youtube? Like can just close the platform now? I mean you're not going to top this...
how to turn 7 mins of content into a 1 hour video
ey, why is this music so good?
Can we also get a video about the human history, starting from the origins all the way to the present? I’ll wait all the time you need
Why didn’t I ever realise I needed that? Thanks
Can we get videos more often please these are my favorite
Is this a dream? Do I really read 1:03:31?
I think my question will be stupid for some but why are the meteorites at the start have flame trails if it was said that the atmosphere was mostly CO2 wouldn't flames require O2 ?
This is a lot to ask, but could there also be a version withour voices? That would be great  for studying!
Is The Sun a deadly laser?
This is amazing!! Can you upload a version with no voice over? I'd leave this on in the background all the time
Can someone make a condensed edition of this video by retaining all the commentary and speeding phases that are repetitive?
how much did this take
This video left me with a ton of questions. Mostly its just "Why?"
Ok, is there please a cut of just the interesting bits? 1 hour is great and all, but I don't want to miss the bits with detail. That I will, when there's an hour with audio void.
How many other civilizations could have existed in the span of those 90 million years at the start of the video, where Earth was just a lava ball in space.
did they thank for this guy, bill wurtz? Because I've caught few references to his history of world
I wonder how many hours they spend on making this video?
Am I the only one who gets overwhelmingly proud of life on earth? From the first cell in the oceans, that's our common ancestor. Life has lived and died, evolved and survived for billions of years to bring us individuals here today. Theres is something powerful there that no words could ever explain.
Where's the cat-head-bob gif when you need it? Cause you could play that alongside this entire video.
How the hell we could terraform Mars😢 jesus christ.. we will probably create bigger iss first
why after the ice age more complex life formed?
is there a way to make this video run as wallpaper on my desktop?
reeaally good the soundrack at 24:24, do you know the name?
Where did the water for the rain at the beginning of the Eoarchean suddenly come from?!
Wait, banger music? 😅
Just imagine if on such grand timescales, humans somehow evolved just a million years earlier... where would we be now, or perhaps not even there? Wild to think how little time periods on such large scales can have such profound impacts.
an hour long Kurzgesagt video?? is this a dream?
Hey, why can I play this picture-in-picture on my phone? I don’t have YT Premium.
is satherian extinction?
1 hour video? This is gonna be epic journey
Where's the purple stuff?
what happened at 29:43?
Why is this free? This should cost money, yet you are willing to give it for free. I turned off my Adblocker for this :)
Digital fusion soundtrack for an hour long video or an hour of animated music video for a digital fusion album?
But the question is;  Is the sun a deadly lazer?
This is so cool, any chance you could upload a narration free version for really just backround play?
1:36 THE FLOOR IS LAVA?
thanks but can we get something like this video with human Era added ?
Am I time traveling if I watch at 2x?
Are the clouds rotated wrongly in the Stenian period? :)
what's next? the history of the universe in 1 hour?
how da fukk you know what erff lookk lik 4.5 billion yyearz ago????
a 1 hour video?? aww you guys are the best!! thank you so much for this vid, kurzgesagt!
Did anyone see the rocket ship looking things in the rock at around 48 minutes? Is it some kind of easter egg?
Was wondering if you guys would change the last part length in order to give us a bit more of protagonism or just do the end of the line as short and plain as it should be. So you DID put human beings more time than we deserve... but still being really short indeed.  Great job, guys
9:56  Bloonarius are you there?
Are you planning on a video about fungi? I love your videos ❤
I am a flower quickly fading, a wave tossed into the ocean, a vapor in the Wind! How small and insignificant am I? Are we?
Awesome! How/from where did the very first fireball started though?
Is the music available for download?
A new kugsart video for the beginning of a programming session? Its one hour long!? My day is a lot better now
Is this Jake Chudnow music?
Make a soft spoken one without music for ASMR?
Would you be able to see any stars with the light from the lava in the Hadeon?
Wait What?! How's this content free!!
Hope i felt something? Oh i felt a lot of things. Mostly i felt insignificant in the large scale of things. As should be.
I really really really want to use this as a 4K live wallpaper. Is there any way for me to get/buy the original high quality (non Youtube compressed) video?

Did Bill Wurtz inspire this? Be honest. I won't judge. He made one hell of a video. I like your animation style better, though.

should I pay for this? i feel guilty watching this for free

Can you make video about whole human history in 1 hour.

I saw the glitch in the Siderian, was intentional?

During the 'floor is lava' era of Earth, how much force was all that radiating heat from the lava pushing the atmosphere outward with? And what effects has that had? How much activation energy was there in the atmosphere due to all this heat that could help with chemical reactions?

When the animators want to know how 4.5 Billion years of work feel
are you planning a 24 hour version of this video?
Can you make a 24h version?
I wonder if someone who had lived all these years, would've been able to grasp the time span any better than we do. I don't think our brains are very good at that.
wouldn’t it have been more logical for the video to use a logarithmic time scale, since we know way less about stuff that’s older than newer stuff?
How long did it take the animation team to make this?
What kind of genre would you call the background music?
HOW IS THIS FREE?!?

So maybe this is a stupid question but how did the first rain begin? I know it began in clouds but as I understand it, clouds recycle water through evaporation and moisture in the air, and then dump it all out. But if there was no water on the earth when the first rain began, how did that happen?
How did they do this

How long did this take to render?
1 hour of animation? This is insane.
F is 4.5 billion years old. WHAT ABOUT e or g?????
Why did the moon fly away from earth after hitting it and then stop at a dustance to orbit? Wouldn't orbit have kept it right next to us immediately? Did it just bounce off liquid lava with such force it went back into space?
Am I in heaven? I do not believe that in the mortal world I can come home to see a 1 hour long pre-history kurzgesagt video on my home page

How many man hours did this take to create? My guess is around 2000, but could be more could be less...  Edit: After seeing a lot of loops maybe 1k?
