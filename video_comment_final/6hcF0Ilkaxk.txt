Thank you for all the love you put into this! We love you too! We're all happy that you did so well post 🍩. You are one of the reasons why we were fans of that channel!   Do you recommend any company that does pre purchase inspections? I'm willing to travel anywhere in the US for the car I want, but I want some peace of mind before buying

Will cars now have 25% import tax since they are mainly metal?
My biggest motivator towards an import is rhd. I was in a motorcycle accident and so far I have very limited range of motion in my right knee that might make getting in a US market car difficult (maybe my truck will still be easy enough to get in and out of? Haven’t been able to try getting in yet). The concern also comes from the compounded fact of me being on the taller side and wondering if Ill be able to get my leg in the door frame in a way that also allows the rest of my body to follow in a controlled way lol. Not making a hasty decision but I am preparing myself for that possibility 🤷‍♂️.

How do you talk about Japanese vans without mentioning Toyota Hiace 4WD’s or Mitsubishi Delica 4WD’s? They’re way cooler.

Either way they're two cars I've always paired together. :P (Then later on we got the Focus RS and Mini GP R53...)  Another car I'd have personally put on my list is the Vitz RS Turbo though I'm not 100% sure if that was a 2000 release or a little later.
