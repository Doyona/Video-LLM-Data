This song is one year old ???
How have I never seen this music video before? The song is perfect!
Who's still here after a year?💙🤍
What’s your favorite part of this video?
Why do I always like songa that are not in English💔💔
What was the original song i can’t remember but it feels so close to
What even is supernova love? They need a love that dies like a star ? I don’t get it. They take the melody of a masterpiece and turn it into…this ??
whos the random white guy?
Not trying to be that person but how come David Guetta sings?
Is it bad I want more of this?
How long are you going to just whine like a kid ?
Why does everyone look like wonyong who is who😂
Why does this song sound like a Mongolian song? The song's name is "Өөр зүйл хэрэггүй ээ"
Why did the instrumental from the intro have to change throughout the song it should’ve just been a royal elegant type beat the whole song instead of a random energetic song
Why didn't Gaeul rap or take part in this other than singing together in chorus?
How come I only knew now?????
Not only are japanese ppl very self centred but why are they all so uneducated when it comes the music industry?? Learn what a sample is
why is it kinda giving love and deepspace
Why did they cut out the second verse?
What? Why does it sound like Utadas song here?
Is there no cool part?😅
Why have I not seen anything about this till now WHAT?
why didnt anyone tell me when this was released ?!?!?
First they steal Chinese cultural elements and call it Korean then steals a Japanese antiwar song to make it into some gross love song??? why do people still like IVE when they don’t respect other cultures one bit? disgusting.
Can you sing more pls
The song is really good but did anyone realise that Gaeul did not even have lines to sing ??
why was the song cut?
Why is this version shorter?
Who is @ 1:35?
i’m sorry but why did gaeul not have ANY lines…?
Is this song a copy?
What kind of dog shit is this?
Are my japanense friends bit dumb ?    They credited Ryuichi sakamoto as compossor , check credits
The music is very good, especially the beginning. Is anyone listening today?
who is here after rebel heart????
and the crowd.... leaves and throws tomatoes???
Do you remember that Christmas?  It was a good Christmas wasn’t it?  Merry Christmas Mr Lawrence!
Am I only one in 2025?

THA FAQ IS TIHS?
i can't believe it didn't get more like ? Like why ? The song is really good !! I feel like we are letting our girls. I don't understand.... Pleas y'all stream the song.
The MV concept is from F4's 流星雨? XD  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocTdA8NytIc
Why this sound very similar to this song that was released 6 months ago before this? https://youtu.be/MaqK8-3WjeI?si=giJamDjRl-668CZ8
What's with the hate?? I don't understand
I don't understand why people hate this song!??
Why do they look like ai????
Where is geoul lines😢
im so confused, wheres leeseos and gaeuls second verse like in the line distribution?
Okay wait. I must admit that I did not at all expect all this outpouring of anger in the comments when I discovered this song. Serious question, why is everyone offended that David Guetta, a renowned DJ who has covered more than one artist's tune during his career (like all DJs in the world in the end), and IVE, a Kpop group any young person who shines more and more due to undeniable talent, having collaborated on an apparently famous melody?
Seriously who write all ive song??  They are so good
WHAT THE F IS THIS COPY CAT?
what a song ? did not felt shame ? just copied a song from a famous musician, shame !! copy cat!!
Why the people just hate the song , this is a lovely song! Ive should have more appreciation
Why does this song sound so familiar?
why didn't IVE appear at the asia artist awards 2024?
Why is this song not popular?????? This is such a bop! Why did i just discover this???
Why are chinese and Japanese people hating on this??
- How many times have you watched this? - Yes
David Guetta isn't supposed to sing? Or he's for the next song?
why are people mad for it looking “cheap” when this is an average blackpink music video
Is there a homage to Ryuichi Sakamoto?
why does this melody sound like the song "快乐旋律" ?
Is this aespa?
Ryuichi Sakamoto songs sampled in Trey Songz, Chris Brown, Joe, etc. songs People: But sampled in an IVE song People: This is insulting, WHY?
There is something wrong, why do I feel that they were not fair with the order of the song??!
What was the clubland version to this with no words
Guys I was watching the mv again and did they just cut the leeseo and gaeul's part???!!!!!
why the fk are u guys even smiling in this song???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
It's like a solo song for Lunyeong and Liseo, why is this different between the members?😢
Awww are the Japanese people really this angry over a sampling? Not the ignorance-is-bliss citizens clutching their pearls when their own government has yet to properly apologize about the atrocities their nation commited. Do we really need to go through this road again? Nanjing? Unit-731? Comfort Woman? But nah, can't sample a song. How about y'all get upset about something that is more important.
WTF why this song sounds like Merry Christmas Mr Lawrence??? Don't copy his song  original-坂本 龍一
Where is the Gaeul and Llz😢😢😢
To those guys who think this as a tribution: Is a murder weapon a tribution to the victim?
Why im fcking feel t-ara vibe???🎉
Why have I not heard this until now?!
Why they ruined this original song
Who is here after MAMA 2024??
Gael least lines least screen time wtf?!
WHAT IS THAT MELODYY??!! ❤❤❤❤❤
Why this people angry when there are Ryuichi name on This song’s conposer credit name? Whats the matter? Literally they give credit… What this people angry for?
You all disappoint me, being upset over a song? Because the original melody has to do with war? That’s the most 1st world country thing to be upset about.
May I know is that possible Japan sue kpop for plagiarism?
What the Fu.....???
South Korea has offended every neighbor. Can Koreans come up with something original? They really don't have a single bit of culture and spirit that belongs to themselves.
Why is there no fall part?
What is this 😑
are they copying aespa?💀 like why supernova?..
I feel that only ridiculous internet-addicted nerds are anti-Korean or anti-Japanese, is that wrong?🤓
How can u use Ryuichi Sakamoto’s song, this is so rude 😅
Is it just me or does this songs melody sound like aespa's just another girl 🤷‍♀️?
Isnt this song sampling like their song after like? Why there are dramas here
istg what do the producers team of IVE even do?They should get fired.
why this song flop?
wtf is this???
Why do Japanese people feel uncomfortable with foreign films that deal with Japanese military war crimes while they respect anti-war songs so much? It's contradictory and hypocritical. 😂😂😂
Where is Liz? I never ever seen her from this video😢. Groub by wonyoung with her dancers. It’s embarrassing. The company should treat its members fairly
Why the comment section like this. Are they take a sample? An original sample and make it a new one or what? Or are they take it freely whitout permission? I don't get it
Don’t you think the music is too strong that you can’t even hear them singing?
But i thought that the original song writer doesn’t want anyone to sample this song, was the things I searched wrong?
Why toxic chinese and japanese love thats sakanoto old boring song, fake story during war
Aimaric songs copy Wonyoung?.
I'm familiar with this song. Is this a Japanese song?
How low was the budget starship
What the heck Starship?
Why toxic japanese not reply me ? they are dummie or what, or maybe just toxic chinese pretending japanese, i know all toxic chinese lacks of knowledge 😂
why every good song only 2 minutes? They should be 1 hour
Why a lot of toxic chinese here, they are sakamoto fans ? 😂
I heard that Ryuichi Sakamoto's family gave permission to use the sample, so why are Japanese people so angry? Go and complain to the family who gave permission to use the song.
Why are Japanese people so angry that they think the song sampled by Ive is plagiarism? LOL
do people in the comments not understand the meaning of sampling? people have sampled multiple songs (yes even after the artists death) and that's normal  no point in policing art, people are allowed to make different interpretations
--> Am I now your hostage?
Why Japanese so upset about not mentioning Mr. Sakamoto(I'm sorry if this is a disrespect way to call him) but I've seen in the description clearly the company mention him
What's wrong with you Ive?  It shows no respect to the song.
0:25 uuh who's this?
now why are ppl hating ive instead of the composer? ive are just the PERFORMERS they are not the ones who had an idea about the sample… yall are indifferent with the composer f u all
Am I now your hostage?
Can anyone tell me why is the comment section suddenly flooded with japaneese comments ??????? What's going on?
Am I the one that thinks that the begining of the song looks like free fall from kinnporsche..?
Speaking of war, where is the mention of Nanking and Unit 731? How about the comfort women? If a simple song is a desecration of the sanctity of a melody, what is it when Japan denies its own history? At least have the honor to own up to your actions. You cant say this melody is a reminder of the sadness of war and then completely deny everything you did during the war.
Is this a comeback? I think this is a weak comeback. They look tired or lazy😢
Why no one scold david guetta but come here to scold IVE ? haters much! This song is perfect !
I’m seeing a lot of people upset over the melody of this song. I don’t want to seem rude, but is this song really disrespectful to the original song Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence?
This song is a cover of a really classic song right? I just can't remember exactly what...can someone tell me?? It's in a movie or series?
Wasn’t the original song on Pure Moods?
What the fuck is this
Is this mv made by Temu?
Where are DIVE?
Why are they only japanese commets? and can someone explain what they are taking about?
Can someone tell me who’s the guy show up near the end of the video? It’s just so random and makes no sense to me😅
What exactly did Dave Guetta do here? Just copy and past "Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence" over the vocals?
Wonyoung ft. iVE, why don't they let the main rapper do the rap part?😢
Why IVE is flopped rn?
i am not korean and japanese and chinese but i do see that this song has no originality wth?
Is this the one used in SG Marina Bays Light Show
Why is everyone hating? Can someone explain in English? Thanks
Are you polite? This is Mr. Wang's song, and if you have copyright, just change it. What's wrong?😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
I dont understand why ppl dont like this song?!
Why is this so under bugeted?
Why is Gaeul so beautiful?
Can someone let me know why they are making a fuss over the sampling of the song? It's been sampled like 19 other times by other artists, so its strange that it's an issue now.
Is no one gonna talk about the fact that Gaeul didn’t have any lines in this MV?
WHO WILL SUPPORT IVE FOREVER?!
Why is this full with japanese comments? 😒
This song has sampled something  and i can’t put my finger on what it’s called, any ideas?  Like the song but the camera work when they’re doing choreo is TERRIBLE
why is everyone mad about this song? what happened?
im confused why is everyone hating?
Ok, the company or anything dont need fans or any one support them, but how can it be so blatant in ....???
Why not think of this song as a kind of rebirth? Can the melody of a song only be used as a definition? I believe this is not the original intention of the original author. I checked Sakamoto Ryuichi’s philosophy and the Internet said that he also emphasized innovation. I don’t think the song ive is 100% wrong.
Did it really require a dance choreography 😭 did it really?! Did it. What was that shit😭💔
Is this a remake??
omg Sakamoto-sensei crying in the heaven, what is this?
Why they show Wongyoung as a soloist every time??!!!!
First China now Japan?!😅
Why dosnt gaul have lines
You guys are still crying?😂Of all people🤨
どなたか、この曲のサンプリングがどこから許可を得ているのか教えてください(AMUSE,universal musicではないことは知っています。)  Can someone please tell me where the permission to sample this song came from (I know it's not AMUSE or universal music)?  누군가이 노래의 샘플링이 어디에서 허가를 얻고 있는지 말해주십시오 (AMUSE, universal music이 아니라는 것을 알고 있습니다.)
is it just me but the views were deleted it used to be 4m+ before ?
i really like this song, why are all the comments bashing? i'm just curious, please educate me
WTH is this song ?! They always copying others song .The song 'Merry Christmas Mr lawrence ' Is talking about war and turned it into a love  song ?!?! Please be respectful
where is the video performance? please drop it, we need it!
CAN PEOPLE STOP COMMENTING COMPLAINTS AND HATE TOWARDS THIS SONG, LIKE WE GET IT BUT CANT WE JUST ENJOY THIS SONG IN PEACE?! IT’S GENUINELY SO GOOD 😭❤
I like it but why is the song so short??
What in this MV production?
Why is there only japanese and chinese comments
Love this collab! But why is it so full of Chinese comments?
When is this song being unreleased?
the instrument's reused right? but it's giving!!
Why many people keep cursing and say bad words here??????  Why r u so negative????  Yes you have mouth, go ahead and just say what u wanna say!!! Blah blah blah.
can someone explain to me what’s happening in the comments??
Wait, this is only a short version of the song?
what's the problem here? they have put his name in the composer and meaning they probably got the permission from the relavant parties for using the song, didn't they?
should have been b side and a slow song, this just feels very rushed and also one member gets no lines? do better next time
They even mentioned who made the instrumental, the artist, whatever you want, but you still want to give hate? But what's wrong there? You want IVE to give the song to someone else too, then you'll be happy? Stop hating, jeez. If you don't like, just skip, and go away.
I couldn't get what's the hate about?
when IVE samples the song they get hate but when chris brown sampled it using explicit and vulgar language that was fine and nobody said anything?
Why are everyone hating on this? I really love IVE, especially this new song! This is so beautiful, i can't help but to loop this :3
Please explain what’s wrong with the melody? I don’t understand
idk why so many people hate it?? can someone please explain?
sorry I don't know much about Japan. Why are Japanese fans so angry about this? I couldn't find any clues in the Turkish translation. In short, what's the deal? My Japanese friends, it is more appropriate for you to answer my question because I would like to get a detailed answer.
People can someone explain what it's happening, and why everyone is mad ? 😭
Is this allowed by Ryuichi Sakamoto's office? Isn't it a merry Christmas on the battlefield?
WHY TOXİC CHİNESE ANGRY ? SAKAMOTO İS JAPANESE, NOT CHİNESE
I once wondered if this company actually despises its own country. Why would they tarnish their country’s image so terribly?
Can we stop copying off other songs kpop😅😂
WHY TOXİC CHİNESE ANGRY ? THİS SONG SAMPLE SONG FROM SAKAMOTO, HE İS JAPANESE, DONT CLAİMED SAKAMOTO İS CHİNESE 🥱
WHY TOXİC CHİNESE ANGRY ? THİS SONG SAMPLE SONG FROM SAKAMOTO, HE İS JAPANESE, DONT CLAİMED SAKAMOTO İS CHİNESE 🥱
Why toxic chinese angry to İve coz use sampling from sakamoto song...i think he is japanese not chinese
Why a lot of toxic chinese here, and also korean with old id only has 1 comment in this channel  hmmm 🤔
Why this song prelude same as FYI by Utada? Haha
where gaeul part?
Why wonyoung in the MV photo because they are a group so star ship has to put all members photo that's so unfair 😢😢😢and gaeul
why doesn't starship promote this song?
I wonder how the proper permissions were granted, and who were behind those decisions?
is this really IVE's comeback??  i'm really disappointed. at least a mini album...
How many classic they have to ruin?
Am I the only one who thinks this song is garbage? Like I don't dislike IVE, but the song sounds awful.
i understand the historic connotation that this song has on asian countries and many people may not know about it, but i'm a little confused as to why so many people are upset when other people have also sampled this song? utada hikaru did it years ago and named it the same thing and i don't remember people getting this upset about it...?
Where is Gaeul ???
Since the Chinese market is gone, does the Japanese market no longer need it?😓😓
Why does Gaeul have no lines??
This band always samples... But creates an original song every now and then, right? or at least if you have to do it, try to understand the meaning of the original one first.. 🤷‍♂
Why do the company/ IVE always use sampling musics, like all night as well and this one. Can’t the producers come up with their own pieces?? ?????? They might as well change their group name to copy cats 😹
I'm so confused why are all the comments in Japanese?
How tf ive can't have bad songs?
How much shameless garbage is created by the concept of sampling?😅
I've heard this melody before... can someone tell me where?
this song has so muchhh potential ( i mean evry ive song) but what mv is this???
is this a joke? ☠️
I don't understand what's the beef with the Japanese and just what's going on?
Why are Japanese people crying in the comments lol what happened 😂
The song is cool, of course, but why did you publish it so suddenly? You could have announced the release in advance. You're posting it without anything.
Entertainment oriented anti war songs? Koreans are crazy to steal
Did they sample the song marry Christmas mr lawrence?
where is Gaeul line ?
Why did they stole the song 'Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence'?
0:13 Starship what do you think? You have a gold group like IVE and you don't even promote them.
What's the story behind Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence?
Why the nugu numbers?
How come no one told me about this😢
Shouldn't Ryuichi Sakamoto's name be written at least? not feel a shred of respect
Why bad comments? 😢
What’s with all the hate? This is such a beautiful rendition by IVE. The song is truly mesmerizing, especially with its lovely melodies and the sample of 'Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence' by Ryuichi Sakamoto. It’s so emotional and beautifully done 😢😢
Guys what’s happened of this song???😕
Ripoff? Copy? Sampling? Dubbing?
Ryuichi Sakamoto song,why they use and make it like this?😢
Gaeul line?🙂🙂where?
where is Gaeul live?
what happens to this song?
Why doesn't anyone talk about the fact that Gaeul didn't have a line?!
Where's our Liz?!
Gauel only have 6, 7 seconds ?! Omg .She is a talented artist😢
WTF is this?
Who gave them permission to ruin such a beautiful song with a lazy arrangement like this lol
The song sampled by Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence, an anti-war piece that deeply reflects themes of same-sex love. Doesn't this remix make it feel a bit... frivolous? It totally lost the meaning at all, Why choose to sample a song with serious background to a love song?Won't kpop Stan who never listen to Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence will misunderstood the melody?
WTF is this? David Guetta stop it !!
When did kpop turn into parody song category
I‘m a little suspicious of the suspicion of malicious network troops. After all, if the Japanese really care so much, why there is no current protest after the Japanese concert performance? It has been a long time since the concert in Japan.
Why is there no views 💀
This nice melody is from "Ryuichi Sakamoto - Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence", right? 🤔
Why did Starship make something like this? How can you put this song out there with impunity?  The producers made this in one hour? Then it's no wonder it's so good.  This song seems to lack respect for Ryuichi Sakamoto. Before he died, he had said he didn't want to do sampling. It's fine if it's just rust, but most of the songs are the same melody. You can make it what you want, but... why did producers put a love lyric on it and It's just a double entendre. Even though it is sampling, but they can't come back and say it's a copy because of how well this is done. Starship cheapened  original song. I can see fans getting angry when they read this comment. They will surely say that it is good because they are mentioning Ryuichi Sakamoto's name. But that's not the point. I wish there was someone out there who understood how this feels...
What the fuck is it
What is it about IVE's actuality that has fallen so far?Everyone's heart danced with such a shocking and spectacular debut, but this music video is cheap and cheesy.The producers are so stupid to turn a war song into a love song.I was disappointed, I was a fan of IVE Japan.However, they are not guilty of anything.I don't want them to appear on Japanese TV without an apology from their office.
why isn’t Sakamoto Ryuichi in the credits?
Am I in heaven ? This song is so incredible <3
Is it okay for Starship to forget to respect the songs of world famous artists in order to make money? This song is not a love song, so it is hard to accept.
Why is ive getting so much hate from the Japanese non fans/fans they performed it in tokyo dome with the Japanese gp KNOWING it was a sample so why are we angry now? Yall just want to attack ive no reason
Can I ask you a question? Do you have permission from Ryuichi Sakamoto for this song? He died last year, didn't he?
do you koreans only know how to steal and nothing else? you bunch really have no skill at all
I wonder if they are trying to get more views with the flames. You don't have to do that to get more views. ...... Disappointing.
Did you get permission from Ryuichi Sakamoto? Don't play the tune on your own, just because Ryuichi Sakamoto dead.
Where is my Gaeul!!!😢 She didn't sing any of a word in this song!!!😭 What is Starship doing???
I knew that Japanese and Chinese ppl hated IVE but not to this extent, tbh I like the song as the original piece... What is the limit where it is considered acceptable to sample a song for its melody?  if the original background of classical pieces is often ignored...
Does anyone know the account/fanpage that says the IVE 'Supernova Love' song is plagiarized? I WANT TO FIND ACCOUNTS THAT TELL THOSE LIES AND WILL REPORT THEM TO STARSHIP! Because SINCE SEPTEMBER the news has been EVERYWHERE that the song was SAMPLED, BUT THERE ARE STILL IDI0Ts spreading with fake accounts and HATERS spreading the HOAX, PLEASE TELL US THE ACCOUNT OF THE HOAX SPREADER because the IVE comments column is now filled with STUP1D HATERS who say it's plagiarism! EVEN THOUGH, CLEARLY ALL THE NEWS ON GOOGLE IS THAT THE SONG IS SAMPLED (like some Kpop songs in general), NOT PLAGIARISM.
tell me what's going on????
Why on earth do people spread false info on the credit. Ryuichi sakamoto is fully credited as a composer in all legit music platforms and official mediums. Targetting IVE is cowardly act.
Why not giving proper credit to Ryuichi Sakamoto?
Why on earth there are lots of bot commenting, can YouTube do sth
Is there album for this
Can IVE release a song without people complaining about stealing culture or samples? Artists get inspiration from other artists, and you don't even know if behind the scenes they contacted each other and asked for permission. Just stop complaining and chill. If you want to say something nice and support the girls, then comment. If not, then leave.
Why do they always show woonyoung first shes not pretty as other members
Do you know the battlefield Christmas of Ryuichi Sakamoto?
What is this cheap trash sampling of a gorgeous sakamoto legacy? So disappointed in David Guetta
Why Gaeul doesn’t own any lines??? Liz as main vocalist should deserve more lines too 😢
Didn’t Hikaru Utada also sample this song into RnB??? I think as long as they pay tribute and respect to the original work, it should be fine? (Even though I think the problem is the consent as well…)
Why no one is blaming Starship took Sakamoto Ryuichi's great song without any permission???????
Wtf is that? So disrespectful
Where’s Gaeul?????????!!
For Japanese commenters: I'm wondering how did you feel about Utada's cover? Her song also sampled the same song by Ryuichi
I wonder who is in charge of choosing IVE's songs? He's been doing it wrong ever since. Heya, he should be fired. I miss when they made songs without collaboration.
why are japanese people crying in the comment section?
Ryuichi Sakamoto - Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence   Can KPOP produce 1 original song per year? Just one please.
What the fuck is this bullshit?
where is gaeul😢
Did someone else notice that the melody from the *estribillo* (I don't know how to write the world in English) is similar to a opening or ending from some anime? I don't recall exactly which one but it's one of the old ones.
How many international fans are here to support them?✋🏻
My gosh, David Guetta and IVE?? I'm here for it!
I'm still waiting for you to sing??  Why is the agency unfair?
Why is this so short? It doesnt  show their full potential - both song and MV feel lazy sadly.
Are this guys trying copy the name of SUPERNOVA from Aespa?But sorry you are not an Aespa ok?😅
Very nice song, but what about the video? Why is it so weird and looks so cheap? IVE always had beautiful and high-quality videos, what happened?
Heart of Asia sample? lol, I don't know how i feel about it.. I am leaning more towards liking than not.
i dont really stan them, is this their comeback or..?
now, think Ryuichi Sakamoto will be sad? LOL
Seriously?!Am I the only one who thought we were listening new track in Maxi Kingdom?
why is starship not promoting ive properly and giving them cheap mvs? they are literally the main group in the agency currently and deserve better.
Is this Ives comeback of is this going to be in a new album?
Is no one realizing that gaeul didn't get any lines in the song??
First "all night" by icona pop and now this by Sakamoto's? So they just like to recycle other songs now? And most people in this coment section thinking that this ive original song made me roll my eyes.
what song is this sampled from? it sounds so familiar…
How is such a perfect song not being promoted properly? Starship??
Uhhh why didn't nobody tel me about this release??
How did they work out the production budget with this great song? Everything is kinda icky visually. It doesn't feel as polished as Kpop usually is. The galaxy cyber punk concept could have been done so much better, David Guetta animation could have been integrated better, some shots of the girls have weird lighting and they don't look sparkly, The dance shot is so plain boring, the outfits too...  It's too bad.
Isn't it Merry Christmas Mr Lawrence??? How can it become Supernova Love without mentioning the original song?? After culture appropriation in heya, copying songs this time? :))
2:05 wtf? So random 😂
i am the one who thinks that this is a song that i could find in Bridgerton?
Where are Gaeul's Lines?
STARSHIP WHY DID YOU NOT PROMOTE THIS BEAUTIFUL SONG? THE SONG IS BEAUTIFUL, AND THE VOCALS???😭😭🎶🎶
Why they give the rap part to wonyoung instead of gaeul, as gaeul is the rapper i expect she atleast get the rap part but she get no line , this is trash
Why is no one talking about Wonyoung rap?? She is really underrated with his vocal, rap, visual and anything..I love Wonyoung and Ive ❤❤
This song has no sing on any South Korea music shows?   Ive had no music shows win this year, I feel a bit lost. Do Ive has another comeback this year?
for real? wtf is this shit?
I wonder when the time is going to come when they finally let gaeul shine. and saying that her english is the worst among the members is not an argument at all, both of her solo performances at their tour were in english, common..
What's wrong with how they show Rei in this mv?? Like whe was a former member or something 😭😭😭
I'm new to IVE, what's the fandom name?
Starship what is this? These ladies made you so much money and now you’re really dropping the ball.
Do you know the content and meaning of Mr. Sakamoto's Merry Christmas on the Battlefield that was sampled?  　 Is this a good song to make into a love song? I don't feel any respect. Of course, the members aren't bad.
Did gauel not get a line in this song?? 😭
Is it just me that the audio is kinda low? I have my volumes up but I can barely hear them. I also hooked it to our speakers and it barely helped
is no one talking about the original version? the melody comes from sakamoto ryuichi's merry christmas mr lawrence. is this a collab?? i dont see his name on the description or an official announcement tho(correct me if im wrong)...mr sakamoto passed away last year on march...its such a nice piece of music.
Rapper Wony? OMG!!!
Uhmm where is GAEUL PARTS?
Is this wonyoung solo song ?
What the fuck starship entertainment gaeul got 0 line Distribution
Why isn’t this song on instagram?? 😭😭
How can they be so pretty 😭😭 and their voice 🥹😍😍🔥🔥
Did you make everyone rap except for main rapper Gaeul? Even in the full version, Gaeul only sang for 6 seconds? It's ridiculous. 🙄
Is there an older song with the same intro music?  This song is giving
Why is this barely 2mins
THE SONG SOoOoOoOoO BEAUTIFUL YET  SOOOOO SHORT, WHYYYYYYY?😭
Seriously? Using an anti-war masterpiece as the sample in K-pop? Sorry, I can’t agree with you.
WHO MADE THIS MV? I THOUGHT IS FAN EDIT..
why do they change the la di da lyrics?
WHY DIDN'T STARSHIP PROMOTE THIS
WHERE IS LADIDA PART????
Is Gaeul still in the group?
Why so short.???
How many songs are there with this name 😂❤
why the hell didn't they just upload the whole song? its only  less then a minute more.. lazy
Is this MV official...?
Why doesn’t the mv have the second verse????
Who thinks the vocals are perfect but the editing is cheap?
why does the kpop industry keep recycling song names
i think i like the song, but the mv looks...cheap? maybe because of the editing or lighting? still, I feel like levitating while listening!
Why isn't Ryuichi Sakamoto's name on the music video credit?
What the hell is this shit?
why is the spotify and apple music longer than this
WHY DONT YOU PROMTE THEM THE INTERNET MADE IT VIRAL BEFORE IT EVEN RELEASED
Why the random white guy in this mv??😂
Why? Just why?
Why not crediting the original composer? You are using a very famous contemporary melody by Ryuichi Sakamoto
Ive, David who? - supernova flop 😂
wait do they sample from Merry Christmas Mr Lawrence? (the music is good)
why the melody seems familiar? what song were they using as the sample?  I found it. They used Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence.
How did I not know about this
Why did they cut Gaeul's lines from the MV? Why not just make an MV for the full song?
Why didn’t they use the full version?
Why did you drop this masterpiece with no warning!!!
What is going awnnnn with this editing?
Why every collab of them have a weak dance? Starship better give ive what they deserve
from love dive mv to this??? oh
Is this a comeback
Why this version is shorter than Tokyo dome version 😢😢
How many fans are cheering for IVE?
Is that anime David Guetta?? Lmao
Is this their new comeback?
I love this song, but can let me at least seeing girls pretty face clearly? 😂
Can you release a version without the beat and make it like acoustic? Piano
Are they not going to credit the song sampled? even if the bought it, it would be polite no?
Why, if this song is by Ryuichi Sakamoto, is it never mentioned, not even in the credits? What's wrong, stop stealing songs.
OMG? THE MV???????
what a strange release! Is this a pre-release? 😅 because there’s little promo
ok, but what does supernova have to do with meteorites?
Why has music become 2 minutes and 30 seconds. And albums are like 6 tracks. What’s the hurry ?????? I want 4 minute songs and albums with like 12 tracks
is the audio supposed to sound weird?
why is the mv kinda bad
it is real? gaeul dont have line?
why did they remove gaeul's only 6 seconds line?
Why is so short like that
starship please dont shorten the song just for tiktok popularity like why was the mv done with low budget and the mv so short?? i hope to see starship as a better company for ive in the future
Why is the  1st melody so fimiliar?!..seems like a chinese music
The song is beautiful, but man, no Gaeul lines? 🙃
no promotion and an mv that looks like its edited with capcut? starship do better for my girlies pls 😭
Why the fuck they sample sakamoto’s song fucking hell sounds like shit
why this barely has views?
why liz dont have a single visual?
Okay wait, what? I listened to the song on Spotify, did Starship cut half of the song? Bc didn’t Rei have a bit after the chorus?
Is this webtoon ost?
Anyone spot Gaeuls lines? yeah I cant see them either😀👍
i didnt even know that they had a comeback song and why is the choreo so underwhelming??? and why the mv look so ai ?? song is a bop but starship hello ?
Where are Gaeul’s lines??
How did I miss the fact that they are having a comeback?!?!?
Weird to have them do it, why not Aespa who already has a Supernova song?
I loved the song, the collaboration and the outfits but screen time and line distribution!! Did Gaeul had only one line or Am I tripping ?? (Without the lines that all the group sang together ).
I like the song Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence very much.  It spans 40 years and is a melody that I have always dreamed of, so I am grateful that it has come out in a new form and almost cried when I heard it for the first time at the Tokyo Dome.    But where is Gaeul's part?😢
Why do I recognize the melody at the beginning?  Edit: It is a sampling from Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence.
Why did they cut out some parts?
Is it just me or do the girls not look like themselves. I swear whenever kpop groups do a western collab, and use foreign film equipment, you seem to be able to very clearly tell that Korean media uses filters or something. Not hating on the girls themselves, I wish them nothing but what they deserve. I just don't like the insincerity.
Why starship is not promoting this song? Its a feat with one of the biggest dj in the world.
why dose this gives me izone Vibes😢
I DON'T UNDERSTAND LIKE WHY DOES IT HAVE TO BE THAT SHORT?? RIGHT?? WE STILL NEED SOME FREAKING MORE GOOD SOUNDS.
Who's your bias on IVE? Me:Liz❤
Wait is this a comeback or some single release? I’m confused since there was no mention of this coming out 😭
Are they straight up sampling Ryuichi Sakamoto? Utada Hikaru did it first lol
?????WHY DID THEY CUT OUT THE BEST PART OF THE SONG??? WHERE IS THE LA DEE DA DEE DA PART???????????
Ok i thought David would sing so theme is perfect vocals mid we could have in their language?
Why every kpop groups start to use "super" in theyr song? Is it trend in korea?
Is not about this song, but what is Supernova Love?
Do they think IVE's need to follow the popular trend to get attention? or
Don't they have enough brains to make IVE's own music style?
I don´t undertand the marketing strategy like why they don´t announce this?
The number of views are surprisingly low  why?
Wonyoung rapping? Omg she is very good too
isn't this melody from mars&mystery heart of asia?
??? a bit disappointed cause I know the original work, but this version sounds not very good
Why does the MV look fanmade???
Why is the song so short? The original version was better. And I agree with the other dives that the mv seems too weak for a company that is not even considered nugu.
what kind of release for IVE
Liz only have 5.2sec? Main singer?
I get... Clannad after story OP vibes from this wait what? Who else remembers Toki wo Kizamu Uta?
Why does Gauel have ZERO lines??.
WHERE IS THE LADIDADIDA PART?!? NO LALALALALA BUT LADIDADIDA GUYYYYYYSS
isn’t the song sound like Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence?
Why are they flopping so hard just like aespa and newjeans 😂 GIDLE, ITZY and lesserafim stay ON TOP ❤
seriously not even any concept photos or teaser? 😭 starship seriously needs to do better
why is the MV 1min shorter than the ytm version ?
Where are the lines Gaeul?😢
It’s amazing and I love the song but why no promo? :(
Can you put all the girls in the thumbnail, please. They are a group
As a huge dive i had no fucking idea the mv of this was dropping what???
low budget MV, what happen to Starship ????
Is that the full song? Please STOP this trend of under 3min and no bridge songs
why are theres collabs always t3rribIe? shes deserved more!!!
isnt this song based on Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence - Ryuichi Sakamoto ? 🤔
Do they even rest? 😭 theyve been working hard ever since debut I didn’t expect song to have mv tbh its sooo good
I love the song and I love you girls but why's too short? 😭
will this too old school
Starship,where is Gaeul’s part ???
but where is the gaeul’s part..? 😭😭
oh is there a missing member called liz?
Is it just me but? I didn't hear and see gaeul having a line in this mv
*Whole **#Liz** first part  is a BLACK tunel XD HELLO? AGAIN?*
this is not a comeback right?
why cut off Gaeul's lyrics ??? Only 3 second's footage is not enough
what kind of screentime is this huhuhuhuhhu, kinda unfair
where is gaeul?
why are there no promotions for this song?? i only know there’s a mv after watching fan edits on tiktok…
i'm here to hate but...why is this actually so good ??? 😂❤️
The song is amazing but unexpected? where did it came from?
Whose voice is angelic? 🎶👼
why can't we have a nice edm song without rap for once
copy aespa？😂😂😂Why does the whole kpop love SM company so much?😂😂😂
Why don’t you want to improve the quality of your videos?Starship what are you doing?
Why did they cut half of the song 😭
why did they cut the second chorus, gaeul barely sang
Can i ask something, is this their comeback?
Is this full version?😭😭😭 so good
Why isn’t gaeul given the rap part?
Did Gaeul sing in the song? I don't hear her voice at any point
Gaeul literally didn't sing, this favoritism goes on until when I've ?
What's with the quality?
where is gaeul's line? 😭
So... there's no Liz solo frame?
Starship what r u thinkin' about? And where is Gaeul Line????????¿¿????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
can we get this bop to million of views? keep streaming!
What do you hear when you get to heaven?
OMGG? WHY ARE THEY ALL SO PRETTY WHATTT
OK but why did they just cut off almost half the song?
Who thinks that it deserve 1B?
I love this song but am I seeing right, did Gaeul not sing one time throughout?
Eh. Why are they singing together like a choir? Isn't kpop about each member having individual parts?
didn't they just release a teaser like yesterday??? i have seen NOTHING towards this song
Did I hear the voice of Gaeul in the MV version????
did gaeul even get any lines in such an amazing song ?!
Did starship run out of money? No promo and this is the MV for this viral song?
Help...I have been looking to this sound --- they literally sound the same --- it's a lullaby but in different language, I think it's from a movie? reply if you know
Why did they cut like the second verse tho
Do they have to name their song supernova too? I swear this is so popular in kpop.
why isn't liz in this mv? she was only seen for a few seconds with the other members. no scenes of Liz alone
Who is this random white man😭
WonYoung rapping ??? Haa ?! And why its so short T.T
Can someone tell me the name of the music in the background? It sound so familiar and I know its a sample, but i cant put a name to it.
WHY THIS ANOTHER MASTERPIECE IS NOT PROMOTING STARSHIT!?
WAIT THIS MELODY SOUNDS SO FAMILIAR I swear its sampled from like a chinese song or smth?? i just cant rmb the title aaaaaaa
How did they obtain the rights to the original piece by Ryuichi Sakamoto? Also I don’t think this should be considered an original piece at all - they’re basically using the main melody line from Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence
umm where was liz?? she really needs more lines and sceeen time what is starship doing.. i get it wonyoung and yujin are ur powerplayers but dont waste the talents of the others shouldve debuted them ina duo.. seriously
Where’s liz?
WAIT STOP did they just skipped the " la di da di da" ??
WHY STARSHIT IS NOT PROMOTING THIS MASTERPIECE?!?!?!?!?!?!?
where are the main vocalist's lines? ive are 6 starship i barely heard her... don't get me wrong i love ive but they are 6 members not 5 members...
ITS OUT OFFICIALY HAHAHAH but where is the promotion at ? Almost half the fandom don't even know this song exists. The same thing happened with all night. ive's English label sucks. Like won't you wanna promote if ur collabing with one of the most popular DJs?
why is no one talking about the strong vocals wonyoung has ????
Why is the order of the music reversed?
Why many songs titles are called "super..."?
WHY DIDN'T THEY USE THE WHOLE SONG?! IT'S SO GOOD
What happened? Just heard recently. Are there promotions?
Your bias in ive?,,,,
Why is the mv greens screen ass?😭 did americans edit this??
I'm gonna unsubscribe..... Gaeul never gets lines she deserves.... I don't know why this stupid starship always doing this with Gaeul....is she the member of this group, or this group has only five members...!!? Gaeul should leave this group and join "THE BLACK LABEL"...... she'll do better being a soloist under "THE BLACK LABEL".......!
Gaeul????Why didn't she sing?!!
Is this remake song?
IVE's vocals is so good but Why is the song shorten?
Why is it only at 200k after 4 hrs like tf is the promotion?
Where do Gaeul singers sing?
why is it only 2mins long 😢
Okay but why the actual audio is longer than the video?
The song is great but why is it so short? Where's the rest, Starship???
Seriously, Starship, do your job right, this is a work of art, and you promoted it as if you wanted to hide it, don't you want the best for Ive?
Are u can find the Gaeul Part?
is this an official comeback?
what the actual F are they singing about?
Shinigami Eyes from Grimes, is it you?
Is it from the Japanese song merry Christmas?
Where is Gaeul ??
Yaaaaa out of nowhere?!?! 😭💕
That tune is "Mr. Lawrence" christmas song, right?
I barely see gaeul🥲 i love the song but where tf is ny girl?!!!
Starship where’s the promotions?!
what is this song sampled from? the melody sounds so familiar
isn't the intro the same as https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGs_vGt0MY8 ??????
Where is the second verse?
Starship... Can y'all stop giving Gaeul & Liz 0 lines ?
Why cut off the middle part?
Why must have rap part ??????
I like the song but why is this video so bad ????
how many k pop songs uses the word "super" in it?  am i missing something ??
Please give me the name of the original song ??? :)
AND GAEUL??? WHERE?
Starship,do you really think this MV is good?🙃🙃🙃
The main melody is from Ryuichi Sakamoto's "Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence." Is it okay, according to his legacy?
No lines for Gaeul ? 😢 I don't understand it  That is not cool 🙄
Why this mv remind me of Khrisna scene in mahabratha series...
Did Gaeul really not get any lines at all? :O
Is it a blue heart?
Is this a cut version? They took out a good part :(
WONY RAP?? i wish the mv included the whole song but it's still soo lovely 🩵🫶🏻 WONY RAPPP ATEE
An English song? I did not know that 😮
it's a great song❤❤❤why did Gaeul get so few parts in the song again?
So..is this the same comet/ shooting star we saw in Heya?
DID GAEUL EVEN GOT A LINE???
This really needs more promotion starship really?
STARSHIP, WHY AREN'T YOU PROMOTING THIS MASTERPIECE?!
WHERE IS THE SECOND VERSE😭😭
Why only 2:34, I want more
Did Gaël at least sing?
WHAT is lt so short 😢 ?
Where Gaeul's line??
Why David Guetta not singing ?
remember when IVE released good music? miss those days
is this song really 2:34 minutes?? why i saw with the lyrics it is 3 minutes ++ ???
what song is this sampling?? omg it's so familiar
Why there's no promotion?
Is missing they power vocal, it was just ok, they are amazing singers, they deserve better
WHERE IS GAEUL SSE?????????????????????????
Is gaeul even allowed to sing? 😅
where are gaeul lines ?
Was Liz ill on the day of the shoot?
WHY IS IT NOT A HIT YET???!! this song is a bop!
Why does it feel like Gaeul wasn’t shown much here? 😢 She’s freakin amazing too. 🤩💐
I wonder if the beat was sampled from (RIP, Ryuichi Sakamoto - Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence (I only knew about this song because of Suga from BTS lol.)
Wtf?!!! Starshit Entertainment  Not even a single advance notice for this? Even the fans have no clue that you'll drop an mv for this collab song!!   Even the time of upload of the audio for supernova love is different in every country...
Where is Gaeul’s part? Wow. Nothing?
How much budget do they spend on MV?
Is 2 minutes enough? 🫠💗
Gaeul doesn't sing or rap, so what should she do? 😢😢
I finally waited for this song, but the song is too short. Why is Gauel’s part missing? 😢 I hope IVE can cooperate with more top 100 DJs in the world🙏
WONYOUNG'S VOICE IN THE FIRST PART?!?!? 💖💖💖💖💖💖
The song is really good but... isn't wonyoung screen time kinda excessive? I dont mean to hate, wonyoung did a great job and I'd understand that she has more screen time in order to catch the eye of the viewer but... Isn't this too much? Gaul or liz hardly have some lines or screen time
Who's that girl wearing white dress? She's pretty. OMG They are all wearing so I guess they are all pretty. LOVE DIVE!!!
Wonyoung as rapper omg??
So where’s Gaeul lines? Come on, we must be fair to all of them.
the intro, what is the name of that song? very famliar music.
WHY DOES THE MV LOOK LIKE THEY ADDED RANDOM CLIPS WITH GREENSCREEN
Terrible song....where is David Guetta?
WHY DOES WONYOUNG LOOK LIKE THAT IN THE THUMBNAIL... SUE THE EDITOR IM SO FRR
Is this cut version? I dont see or hear gaeul's line here
WHO TF EDITED THIS MV... WHY DID THEY ADD THE HD FILTER LIKE THOSE INSTA SIGMA EDITS
Isn't this a really nice song?😩😩
I thought there's no mv for this song? 😭 I love this! ❤Please promote IVE properly Starship!!
Why is starship so mean? No teasers, and no promotions. Fans are wondering if it's audio or video. Now they just suddenly released a video. How cruel.
why is this only 2 minutes?
Why is the views so low?
Does Gaeul have any Line?
WHY DO LIZ AND REI APPEAR SO LITTLE IN THE MV AND GAEUL HAS "NO" LINES IN THE SONG???? 😢🙁
no one notice right? this isn't full song? in tokyo dome they have gaeul part and more
Why is it just two minutes, why is it so ugly,  and why does it sound like shit?
Wonyoung Rapping??? Like seriously???
Why didn't they put "short version" on the title? Non-DIVE will think this is the full song.
Where is the melody in the beginning (and the chorus) coming from? I've heard it before, maybe from some anime or so?
huh?? literally where did this come from? you really have to promote the fact that this is happening better, starship.
Why did they cut it though???
Wait isn't this shorter than the actual audio version of the song ??
what did you do starship???
why Liz doesn't get much screen time? :(((((((
Did they change the song a bit ? Where’s the la dee da dee da part 😢
This is mv or teaser?. Because it just 2 minute. The og one is 3 minute
Wait isnt the sound supposed to be longer? With gaeul and rei's rap??
Why is the 2nd verse not included😭😭
WHY DID YOU MAKE A SHORTER MV? The actual song is 3 min 20 seconds. Why??!?
What is this gaeul has zero lines
How's this? Tell me, wow, beautiful and new to the world of K-pop! That's really nice 🥺💖
Why is the MV shorter than the actual song?
Omg where did this come from???
Why the verse 2 is cut?
Hmm btw where is wonyoung in black?
PLEASE FIX THE HORRENDOUS  MIXING 😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫 Like at every chorus like at 1:00 i can hear someone on the left behind on "i'm" is slightly flat, sounds like Rei. And it totally distracted me for the rest of the chorus. Am i the only one? I wish i could just not notice. 😢 Love the beginning part😢
Why are the "Ladidadida" parts are missing😭💔
Absolutely no lines for Gaeul while greedy Wonyoung takes her rap part?
Why is so short??? This song needs at lest more 60 seconds, sounds like hit
Why is Ryuichi Sakamoto's name not credited?
did I miss the part when gaeul sings? or she doesn't have a part at all?
Who are these Divas.
The song is okay, it's growing on me But the MV? idk the vfx and cgi was not it Starshp can do much better than this
where is liz and gaeul lines
Who is this is it Rei? 1:33
What do you all think about this song ?
i do love the song and MV but the duration of MV is only 2:34 minutes? seriously???
So... Gaeul doesn't exist in the video or the song?? wtf why is it so short than the one they sang in the show?
Is this remake or new?
why its only 2 minutes without the second verse help starship what are you doing
It’s so short?!
looks like a junior group concept with junior group vocals lol??
Where’s the first lalalala part?😭 and Gaeul😭😭
Ok, sooo no lines for Gaeul? 😔
Does Gauel have a single line in this song?
why is this soo short, is like an ad song
Is it really a new mv for DIVE❤??? For real??
WHO'S HERE TO A MILLION VIEWS???
who else cried??
wait WHAT??? am i tripping???? LOVE THIS
How many international fans are here to IVE?
