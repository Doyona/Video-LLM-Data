Is it a car he need right now? I think what he need first is health
So what the need of the car since he can't sit..??  Am just curious.
Does he need car or surgery
So can’t something be done about his situation? Like getting medication😢
HOW CAN HE DRIVE IF HE CAN'T SIT? GET HIM AN ELECTRONIC SCOOTER TO ENABLE HIM ATTEND LECTURES
If he can’t sit, will he drive?
