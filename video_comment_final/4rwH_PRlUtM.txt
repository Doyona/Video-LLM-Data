What is this goalkeeper even doing here? It looks like he had no intention to save those freekicks at all. This looks like a fix and it's really bad for football. He couldn't even win them the league, now it looks like they are trying their best to let him statepad. This is why he came to this league after being rejected by almost all ucl playing clubs and his own club.
