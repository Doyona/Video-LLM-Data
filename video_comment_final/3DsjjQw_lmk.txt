"What fade is not foreseen?" 🎻🎶
Which pressure are you applying? you just ran from Kdat beef 😂😂😂
Is that the album release date on the ticket?
How many verses of the year this year is Cole gonna write?
Oh a new Drake and Cole song ?
And this guy said he was drake’s ghost writer? His verse is 🚮
is this the same sample on J Cole - Rise and Shine
Is it just me or is the beat a different rendition of dead presidents. 🤔🤔
Why is Cole always so fucking boring with his delivery, I can't listen to this shit, they are both boring as hell. He's a great writer but a bad rapper because he's so fucking slow and boring with very weird choices when to pause.
what the date is on the top right of the check?
"How many more verse of the years is Cole gonna write?"
When this gonna be on streaming services
Can some one make a version with Cole verse only please thank u
Shout out to both artist it’s a dope track hands-down, but can I just ask one question is this something that J. Cole has done on this song that we have not seen him do before? 🤷🏾‍♂️
Where is the beat?🤢
what was this beat originally from? I cant think but I just remember it was 🔥
Are nigga really sure Cole is scared of Kendrick? Cause we all know that Kendrick didn’t rap like this on not one diss song… ijs…
where are drums?
Why do people get on a song with Cole and feel like they gotta rap all extra lyrical
You know that feelin' when-?
Placed inside the trap, tapped with laxatives and we think that we runnin' shit?
What fate has not foreseen
How can yall hold this man accountable for being a Grown Man. What Cole did was grown man shit. Great Song Daylyt .
So, where’s the beat?
This a leak? Can’t find it on any platform
Is this freeway beat? Shit sound so familiar
Does anyone else get angry when u Kno coles verse is almost over???
Is this real??
