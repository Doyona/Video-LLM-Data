Do St.Hp is special cancelable?
No teleport command???
Why can't he teleport tho??
Is the health bar glowing?
How much does M Bison cost in street fighter 6
Who else thinks of Raul when u see Bison
Great video! I am super curious tho, what is he like on modern controls?
What do you think of his new design?
Weird as it sounds, Bison doesn’t seem to smile menacingly as much and I kind of like him better as a result???
Hasn't Psycho Power been purple ever since Rose was established, starting after Alpha (in which i believe it WAS also blue), it was purple in 4, 5 and now 6. Purple power leaks out of Bison in one of his round wins and he converts it to blue, Ed also changes from purple to blue in this game, and JP has his own Psycho Power which is the usual purple and black.  I'm pretty sure Bison is using a form of soul power.
I wonder where Hiro and SD PNoy and Tampa Bison are right now
I wonder if we'll get another Giant Impact against Shin Bison.
oh so dont have that V skill 2 from sf5?
Is it just me or does his character model look a little smaller in comparison to Guile?   Anyways, they juiced him up so hard with this version of Bison. He is like a collection of the best tools of each version. From the fast speed of the classic design to the psycho mine of sf5 bison. They really buff a lot of his offense. His lack of traditional anti-airs & pesky fireballs were always been his weaknesses. But with these new changes to his psycho crusher & faster down fierce, he's a lot stronger dealing with his weaknesses.
Sorry if I missed it, but do we know if Bison's jump roundhouse is still a cross up?
Roof, does Bison have his teleports?
Will there be an event for bison like there was for akuma? Maybe vs SiRN (shin) Bison
How can you look at that thumbnail and think the new design looks better than the classic? Classic makes him look like such a menace! Almost Zombie-fied.
How is he on modern?
have you try the combo trial??
Can he no longer teleport?
Literally fucking why change charge moves? To appease casuals? I don't fucking get it.
Does his level 3 go full screen?
I don’t full grasp the charge system, will that be a big problem playing Bison?
What are situations where you would rather do regular head stomp than devil reverse?
But does Devil's Reverse have cross-up properties again though?
No alt Color’s for horse?? 🥺
Does the M in M Bison refer to modern ?
How much are the characters to unlock?
"Are you a different animal and the same beast?"
Is bison controlling sagat body or was that a lie
Do you think that we could become M Bison's student if he spawns in World Tour?
Is his stand jab his 4 frame?
Why did Lily get lame 'buffs'
biggest problem where is his outfit 2 cape????????
Did you have a peak at his MODERN version ?
When is release date?
Isn't Bison supposed to have a teleport? I'm pretty sure he could teleport in 4
Where is Bison's teleport move????
When are they going to fix Ken's run that always comes out lol :) ... Bison looks sick
Why are they releasing characters so soon all of a sudden?
Minor question, what's up input-wise with his classic slide versus his new sweep?
Anyone else notice how C2 bisons hand is constantly fidgeting? Any thoughts on that?
This might be wishful thinking but now that Scissor Kick is a motion input is it possible that it could be used as an unorthodox anti-air? Or perhaps as a way to cross under someone trying to jump attack you?
Does he have his SFII costume? For the sake of nostalgia?
Wasn't T.Hawk your SF2 main? 🤔
Dude....that's a real move name. Bison has attacks like Devil's Reverse, Shadow Rise, Psycho Crusher and I get Double Knee Press and  Head Press doesn't necessarily follow the name scheme but BACKFIST COMBO? That's the name they went with?
Does he has a throw loop?
Meister Rooflemonger. Some questions please:  1. Any invincible special moves? 2. Are the scissor kicks safe?  3. Does his st. HK whiff on crouchers? 4. Is the mine planting punch safe on block?  Thanks again, you are a true gentleman and a devout scholar.
Did you manage to test if stHK was a good anti-air?  Cause that button was a godlike one-button fast way to snipe people jumping back in SF4
It's just me or that CA is really long?
What about his Crouching HK (Slide or Sweep)
Aren't you the guy that also fixes up watches?
does sf6 got like fight money currency to buy characters?
Please tell me he’s +150 on every normal like in 5 ?
Oh my god dont tell me they remove his disapear and reappear from the other side ? Because i dont see it
Did anyone notice when you're in CA health range with a level 3 the health bar flashes yellow?  That's new right? 1:14 & 17:57 before the CA comes out the health bar is flashing.
Can he combo with the detonation after a throw?
Did you happen to see how mine worked on DI?
What I would like to know is if EX Scissors or EX Psycho Crusher can be used as a reversals.
I guess im the only 1 that misses the teleport dash and projectiles?
Did you try out modern controls, any idea what moves he loses? I’m curious if he keeps the overhead and overhead-low target combo.
i do question whether the blue stuff is simply bc of classic bison psycho power: they very specifically show him trying to hold it back and turning it into purple energy like whats contemporary with psycho power nowadays, let alone the fact that only some moves use it; could either call back to him being fucked up by the power of nothingness in V; maybe its old bisons soul screaming to be set free deep inside this insominac bisons body? its hard to say but theres certainly some story intent behind him having both purple and blue energy instead of just one or the other
Oh also is knee press/scissor kick safe on block? And if it is, Does it require the right spacing?
I know that DI is not the demon it was but I still feel like some of M.Bison's normals look very slow on start up. In your opinion will DI or perfect parry for that matter pose a problem when it comes to applying pressure with normals?
10:10 did they change the burnout bar to make it easier to see when it refills?
Is it just me or does the audio desync slightly near the end of the video?
Is it me or does the Drive bar look slightly different in when in burn out?
I'm wondering if Ryu did the Power of Nothingness on M.Bison at the SFV and sealed some of his evil psycho power away and that's why he doesn't remember who he is?   He's still looks evil but he sure isn't M.Bison from the past personality wise from the trailer.
Content drought, when?
Are his scisor kicks safe on block? Is his psycho mine back fist safe on block?
Did you test Psycho Mine > Throw > Explosion Juggle ? He seems to have "Vortex Potential"
No Modern footage?
Bison cant teleport anymore?
He died so he could run. Is it weird to be bummed out that knee press is a qcf move than instead of charge even if it's obviously a giant buff ?
Why does he have a horse ?
Yo roofle da god do you have a dojo in SF6? I want to join you should make one 💪🐵
Why are they not filling up the space next to Luke and Jamie on the character select screen? It's driving me crazy!
Does he have any weaknesses?
ughhh why couldn't they make the kick charge as well???
Hey Roofle. Will you make a video about the new tekken 8 balance patch?
Damn he looks cool. Does he have an invincible wakeup?
Isn’t that standing on the hand thing another reference to the animated movie? Maybe I’m misremembering.
Where is fei long???
