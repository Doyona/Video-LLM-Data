genuine question why are stadiums half empty for this match?
Who designs these silly Tsisipas getups ??  Surprised he agreed to wear it
3 min?? These need to be at least 7-8 min.
Why Alcaraz Garfia yelling ? It seem disrespectful ..
what I don't understand, with Novaks retirement there seems to be one player missing? Where am I wrong?
Who do you guys think is going to win? Sinner or Alcaraz?
Is his grunt extended?
Stefanos hit a smash right at him??? 2:14
So whole tiebreak in second set is not even a highlight not even a one point? Amaizing job as always but i think 3 minutes is too long for grand slam, cut it to just pictures of set results
Anyone know what Tsitsipas was frustrated about during the second set tiebreak?  I had the audio off at that time.
Why is Tsitsipas STILL SO AWFUL at recognizing / reacting to / handling drop shots? Why hasn't he learned since they cost him so many big matches, including the FO 2021 final?
Not even the grunt?
How did you skip the tie break completely?
Don’t you think this slightly looks like a fedal match? :)
This edit is weird. Why mostly Stefanos winners? huh? I mean Carlos won. Show some of his too.
Whole highlights but not a single shot from the second set tie break?
why won't Nike release the shoes that Alcaraz wears? This is like the 3rd or 4th pair of shoes that Nike won't release. Anyone know the answer?
Did he inherit it from his father?? 🤔
