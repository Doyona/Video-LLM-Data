How does gold bridge not choke out the old geezer… lol
What does Bruno do best, Beth?
Elanga better than Rashford and Garnacho? This guy doesnt have a clue. No doubt Rashford has been absolute trash this season but really ... Elanga had more than enough opportunities at United and was not convincing at all.
Bruno better than Odegaard? Seriously😮
Have you ever seen Ten Hag admit he got it wrong and hold is hand up its his fault? if you have post it because I don't think he ha it him do so - his ego is too big never at fault.
What part of manchester is Jordan from? He sounds like worzel gummidge.
How much did Ten Hag from Antony’s trade? Lol
Why beth is sucking bruno off like that?
What is this revisionism with elanga lmao he was terrible at United 😂
Serious question Beth do you really think Bellingham would be the same player is he came here did you see what we did to sancho?
I would love to know at what point Jordan would consider sacking thr manager? What if he loses another 8-9 games which seems very realistic based on the number of games left
Why do our centre halves drop back instead of confronting a striker about to shoot
Wasn’t elanga and Anthony sold/ bought in different transfer windows ?
Have we not lost every game we played in the stupid stripped gear (including pre season)?
