Pink ish!
More brown
I've been insecure for a long time about my thin hair which used to be quite thick but due to diabetes and PCOS it's thin now. I would always look at Nikkie and think that she is blessed with her thick and beautiful hair. I appreciate her showing that her hair looks that way thanks to the extensions she has. Now I'm feeling more confident.
I'm thinkin like a strawberry/pink/peachy color!
I just watched your coming out video and I just want to say you are so inspiring and incredible. Thank you for telling your story,

Soft pink?
i'm guessing a pinkish purple color!
blue
I really LOVE Nikkie's palette and I use it a lot.  I should probably need to get three more because I really like the ones where you can just use your finger to pat them on because they are really GREAT!  I did a look yesterday using one of them.

Like a light copper?
definitely going to be pastel pink
Rainbow!!
She looks GREAT!!!
Won't the extentions make Nikkie go bald though? Is that really safe for the health of your natural hair?

Extensions destroy your hair by being pulled out.  Wigs will be more protectives.

Idk but i got to use to seeing u in blonde that i think platinum would look absolutely fabulous but that also is damaging to the hair so i would also like to see u in a soft purplish or soft girly pink color with a little bit of grey when the sun hits it or another color underneath so that when the sun hits its it changes
Its pink!!
Blush pink with lavender @eknoorahluwalia
i think you should do a makeup challenge like the first letter one but instead of just using your name use the name of the product (primer starts with p, foundation starts with f, concealer starts with c, and so on)
My guess is - pink or purple. @sil3nce96
platinum blonde!
Purple?
like a rose pinkish kinda thing? @noor.noortje.cllrs

Pink ☺️ @marla.goll
Morelo cherry colour! ….
Pink?!?!  @ceashmia
I feel like that with your complexion you should choose a colour like you could be a pink roan (I know this is a coat one gets in horses. I mean no disrespect. It is a red interspersed with white which makes it look pinkish). I have never seen anyone with that hair colour. But I think it would look like really cute on you with your fabulous blue eyes and white skin.
Dutch life, my natural hair is fine, thin, in little quantity and white blonde haha

Back to brunette or blue and pink @jordangaines86

Purple... cuz once it wears out can go back to blonde quickly
pastel pink🤷🏼‍♀️

Either burgundy/red or dark brunette
My guess is an ginger red!! Would be fab on you!
I think pink!   @kokomispearl
My guess would be a light lavender because it would compliment the undertone of your skin and your eye color. Also a lavender would fade out of blonde nicely, probably just toning out any remaining orange pigments. @grimoiregrotesque
Some version of pink would be gorgeous on you!! 💗
pink
A light brown gold color

I’m really hoping for like a faded pink kinda color💖   @janne_janssen__
Her eye shadows pink in cover so think might be color that compliments it like hot pink (might be too bold so prob not), red (not entire hair), or multicolor (gradient/ombré) Update: it wasn’t ombre or gradient exactly (still amazing) but it would look so cool on her for a future dye 😇
I think it's going to be copper, it would suit your blue eyesss so well 😍 @jessi0795
Strawberry blonde!! 🍓
i think of the color baby pink

Ginger 😍  @mytimeas_Alexa
I think a peachy/light pink colour!  @_crownofthorns_
I don’t think you’d go back brown….my first thought was blue if you were going bright/wild, or if you were to be more subtle I reckon you’d rock a pastel shade, maybe like champagne pink or a dusty pink would look 👌🔥🔥 @izzboz
Omg!!! I’m a Pisces too!!!!! Love it!! March 10th is my Birthday
I feel like changing my hair color is the one thing I can do to change it up (bc I don’t wants to cut it!). I do more pinks and lavenders. I haven’t done it since getting extensions (same kind u have ) - but I’m going lavender again in a couple weeks !!
Pink 💖💖
Rose gold? Or a red tone
pink!!!!! 💓💓💓💓
I think it will be like a blush pink or maybe purple, but I'm leaning more towards blush pink. She has nice blonde hair so it wouldn't be as hard to achieve, if I had light hair I would dye my whole head a pastel color!
Ginger…….😉
Red ? @barb.__14
cotton candy color is my guess @daniellava_
My guess is pink/rose since your planet HER insta video, you would look GORGEOUS in pink hair
I’m going to guess pinkish blonde hair ❤️❤️❤️  Edit : I was very close pinkish/purple blonde looks so pretty ❤️❤️

Happy birthday to mama-tutorials !

Strawberry blonde @tawny.Hyster
You get more color out of kool-aid dyeing your hair :/ glad I skipped to the end
Gray/lavender @heatherwiginton
Pelirroja
A dark red would be gorgeous! It's a common "changing up my hair colour" type of colour.
Wooow revolutionary 🤣🤣🤣🤣
i think she’s going cooper
Lavender!
Is it magenta????
kinda expecting it to be rainbow like in the thumb and I actually find your natural hair so pretty w/o the extensions ❤️
Purple
Pink!
My guess is that you got pink hair! ♡ My ig is @dani_romane
Rose gold/Blush ?? You could literally pull anything off
Pink- @stephrollins_az
Pls go ginger @raphaelnioannou
A
Purple (a vibrant one lmao?)       Yes, it wasn't ofc
I reckon you'd look awesome in a red/ginger moment! :))
my guess is a light purple color, like a lavender 🥰💜 @rrosemarrie
I would say pink red maybe blue!
Bright red! Like your fiery personality and the passion you give others @satan_incarnate

I think it’s going to be a strawberry blonde/soft orange moment 👩🏻‍🦰🤞🏼🤞🏼🤞🏼 @zoey.franz
I’m guessing either a slate or a bright purple. But let’s get real you can pull off ANYTHING.
I personally would love to see you with a light auburn colour (light natural red head)... however I honestly think you'll just get a slightly darker blonde tone to what you normally have (@jessie.rob) ❤️
Pink
I feel like it’s gonna be an auburn red or some kinda of dark red mixed with brown. Or I could be wrong and it’s a fun color lol
I'm a day late and luckily the first few comments don't say what your hair colour is. I think you are going to go a  pastel pink/ more of a dull pink. You'd definitely suit it. @jessicac04_
Imma guess rainbow hair, don’t ask how I got that idea ;)
My mind instantly yelled "GREEN!!!" but I know that's not it! XD I think I'm the one who wants green hair lol. If I take 2 seconds to think about it, I'd say pink. I doubt it will be a natural color...
I really thought she did rainbow hair
Pink & blue
Hmm, pinkish-redish? O:-)  edit: oh no :c
Pink @ Jojo_luvs_17

I believe it's red color!  Edit: dang it but the color looks so pretty!
I did a similar color last summer, though I kept my roots much darker and longer. It was a gateway drug for myself.  I actually got a pixie cut and bleached it platinum. I had the color bug and have had ever changing pastels since.

Rose gold? Timestamp: 9:58
Looks so beautiful! Kind of a weird observation, but in the reveal part of the video my eyes were drawn to the white inner parts of your eyeshadow. I couldn’t stop staring at that part of your eyes? And when I was focused in on that inner corners and you would blink it literally would look like butterfly wings flapping. Anyone else?

My random guess for what color your hair could be is a toned down pink because pink is usually present in each of your videos, and I believe it would be very stunning to see you rocking that hair color. 💗💗💗 ~ (@haukdough)
Super gorgeous ❤️

I’m thinking like a blush pink but like a hint. V.Carlson_

Girl I never knew you had extensions seriously. I seriously think any color is going to look gorgeous on you. But I'm guessing possibly like a rose gold. I'm thinking that's going to look absolutely gorgeous as well on you. Or that's my own self wanting rose gold hair and I'm just projecting my dreams onto you which is selfish but I can't help it I think it'll look great on you as well. @81wicket
baby pink

I knew it! But I definitely thought it was going to be more pink on the ends but I still new it would be pink! Perfect blush shade tho since you naturally have a lot of pink under tones going super pink wouldn’t have been great. Your stylist definitely knows what she’s doing 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
maybe srawberry blond or red? (sylvies_gf)
Purple!
I don't think it will be anything bright or too drastic, so maybe some type ot strawberry blonde color, just enough to notice a difference, but nothing too out there. I'm sure it will look amazing, no matter the color!!!    ig: noragrey__
I think it's going to be blush pink and hints of purple
I think it will be blue

Based off the darkness in the bottle but Nikki’s saying it was bright and that she wanted to eat it, I’m guessing it’s a purple or pink? But looking at her with the makeup on, you can still see lots of highlights and lowlights, so I’m guessing it’s a more pastel version? I’m gonna say lavender/lilac. Maybe that’s just wishful thinking 🤔
Rose gold? I think something light and sweet would be perfect! A natural red, or even a light silver blue

I'm guessing multi colored pastels! @nikkivanwestrienen
You are the most beautiful woman on this earth💞💞💞 hugs 💞💞💞
Lavender perhaps
It's gotta be back to brunette and maybe some highlights/balayage with a soft money peice in the front to still have that blonde feel. I can't imagine you doing something drastic for the first time in a long time, (unless it's rose gold). @vulpixen
Rose gold would look so gorgeous on you (@rachelruthcat) 💜

AM I CRAZY OR DID YOU GUYS ALSO THINK 'PINK!!!' THE MOMENT SHE ASKED US TO GUESS???? And I imagine it to be the pink that Sakura from Naruto has: light, vibrant but almost faded pink.

The moment you say "I wanna eat it" i KNOW you're getting some shade of pink. Since there was not much of a decoloration i imagine some blush pink or MAYBE dusty lavender (but imo pink is the most edible colour you'd be kidding me if you said otherwise)
I bet all of my money it is going to be pastel pink!!! (@biancabieee)
Du rose probablement 👀💖 Naekono

I was thinking a light pink and/or purple. Crazy
Oehh I love this challenge!! Everything about you SCREAMS rose gold but I don't think you would go full pink dye, so I'm gonna say a slightly warmed toned light pink. Lilac is also very on-trend so I could see that going for you, but I think you will stay true to the pink 🔮✨ Exciting! (@charlotte_vv)
ik zeg je eerlijk. ik zie echt oprecht geen verschil
A Rosé colour would look amazing!

I think she’s going to go a strawberry blonde/ very light ginger
Your going to be a redhead💘 @yos_xxo

Ik denk dat witblond of koel bruin je heel goed zou staan. Maar misschien ook wel juist een ombre in een niet-natuurlijke kleur? Ombre met pastelroze? Pastelblauw? Nee pastelroze? @sannemariax
I think it’s gonna be clear purple or ginger (@maureen_scv)
I feel it's blue  Uughhh u looks stunning but why it's not blue

Something in me says lavender, but knowing Nikki she's probably gonna go pink😂 (@maevesmits)
Purple?
Pink, only cause I feel its an easy color to do if you haven't done color before 🥴 (sweetbloodyminttt)
PINK ITS PINK ITS GONNA BE PIIIIIIINK 🥰   @bij_fem

Ombre purple
I think you will do a pink with purple and lavender @loolo123
I'm not sure, but I think it'll be pink. It matches the nails
Ik denk of bruin of roze en dan een beetje koraal roze wat het ook is ik weet zeker dat het onwijs goed bij je zou staan!🤩 (dorianbos._)
I believe that will be smth natural but no no no it will be smth like flowers  @_is.ya_

Pastel Pink 💕 @domtheblonde

Green?
Pink or purple would look great on you!!!😍❤ @raina_teotia
I think you'd look so amazing in a chestnut brown or a hazel!
I think it’ll be like a strawberry/gingery darker blonde! @byemiliexx
I originally thought pink or maybe a light purple, and this new hair colour looks so amazing on you. (charlottemhj)
Strawberry blond?:) @_annafranke_
lilaccc!! @reitxmakeup
pinkkk?? @reitxmakeup
Mauvey-pink ? :))) @veronicavalentinailiescu
Ok I’m at 2:42 and I really think you’re going for like a light pink but like almost natural looking like if you dyed brown hair but w bold hair idk @alicetheegge
Feel like she is gonna dye it pink idk why  @cody_sean027
i hope it is that peachy pink that she was talking about on instagram a couple of weeks ago :D
it has to be CHROMATICA PINK!!! @nicoladuckk
I really don't know but silver ? Coz I've been following you for a while and looks like you like gold/silver/shiny things. Silver will actually look soo cool ✨
Blue
I think a strawberry/pinkish blonde would suit you so well!! (@jovieshome) and I’d use the gift card to visit Elise too!! She did such a fab job!!!
I think 🤔 you are the only person in this whole world who can carry any dam color like a boss . But for my guesses I think you are going to go for something between pink and red. Like some pastel mixture of pink and red.  Hope to win . My insta id is- ila_smiley_jain ( @ilasmileyjain)
Pink 💓
I would say your new hair colour would be honey golden blonde
I have a feeling she’s going to go purple because purple ALWAYS compliments her eyes!
If you're anything like me you like to ease your way into change. So in saying that I think a soft baby pink look. No matter what you dye it I'm sure it's going to look fabulous. @1_very_tired_mumma
Deep brown, maybe a balayage or highlights
I think the color could be ginger I just have this intuision!  (@sintsaaa)
Pink 100% before dojng a drastic change I think she would go a light pink colour in some places, like a pastel. Also we all know you love a bit of pink so🥰 been with you through it all, I bet it’ll look great! Xoxo
I gotta say pink!!  @morgan_vice
I think brown❤️❤️
I think it’s gonna be light/blush pink with light purple?
Lilac??
I can’t decide between whether or not it will be a rose pink or a silvery lavender…..but I also feel like teal……  I think teal is too bold. You seem like your makeup can be wild, but you’d prefer a more natural hair. My vote is rose gold.
A peachy colour 🍑. @marionchatz
I think nikkie is going for blonde with a bit of pastel/rose pink or lavender. her nails kinda telling me that🌺 (@annaapiasecki)
Pink? @cileklikekstraa

Your hair is also very beautiful without hair extensions, but understand why you wear hair extensions. The end result is really beautifully done. It's always super nice to watch your videos because I always get on my face because you are always soooooooo happy
Yes I did
rose gold??
I think it will be a baby pastell pink. I hope so 😁 @paula.molo
I would say it is gonna be like a lavendery purple, like very light, but a pop of colour
I think some type of neon ish green would be nice or just like a forest green
I guess your hair will be pastell pink or light brown 💗🤔
Baby pink @saadaena

I think your hair will be pink. If it is pink it will look lovely on you. @reaganinit

pastel purpel colour
At first I thought it was going to be dark brown again, like it all started, but then I was hoping you'd do something bright and colorful, like light pink or purple💜💖 @marie_esser
My guess would be pink! But I agree, you would look absolutely stunning in a natural looking ginger tone! Also your hairstylist does an amazing job with the weave! In 99% of all cases I just think extensions look gross andd overdone, but in your case they are perfectly executed and I absolutely understand that you want to have that extra volume and wear your hair long.
Red for Mikai ❤️❤️‍🔥❤️  (insta: mikonetsu)
Pink
Light brown !
I'm hoping for lavender or pink ish, you would look stunning in that! Marjolein120
Rainbow🌈🌈   insta: celine_beutels

Rose gold?
I feel like orange I don’t know like ginger hair I don’t know😅😅
Omg it’s pink isn’t it!

Red
You know that now we gotta see you trying on a bunch of different colored wigs just for funzies

I think you’ll change it to blue! ❤️ @andrea_gonzalez210198

I'm thinking purple. Thanks for the chance. If I were to win I'd put it into apartment stuff since I just moved. @mirandaleemua
Brown!!
I’m thinking  pink/purple   @kuky87 It makes me feel better about my hair knowing that you have hair extensions  A lot of influencers aren’t half as real as you are I have thick hair but it takes years to grow I have it till my shoulders know after a year of letting grow out  Ps.after watching the video I was thinking you were doing like a hot pink purple unicorn color 😂😂 But I love it you look amazing
Maybe you got pink hair. 🤔🦩 @x.mrs.siegmund.x
🌈 rainbow or maybe strawberry blonde
Im gonna say maybe like pastel pink,pastel purple and pastel blue?
Pink? I feel like pink is a really feminine pretty color it would suit you. nxtxliyx

I think your hair looks beautiful no matter what, but I think a red brown
Rose gold💜💜💜💜💜
Pink?
I think it's red! Or gradient pink
Bright red would look amazing on you!
I feel like she’s going to be in the red family now, like a ginger or burgundy
Red

Red i guess is speaking to me, maybe because i want to dye mine red… 😅
Probably a baby pink/gold pink/light pink. Definitely it will be some kind of those. @ariaobispo
Either red or pink 😯🥰
I think some form of soft purple or purply/pink tinge over the blonde...i just think that'd look really cute just adding a little something to spice things up (maybe its the tshirt sending me messages haha)    instagram: @shannabetts
Honestly I don’t think you’ll be doing a mermaid color (blues greens and turquoise) this time around, but it’s what I’d love to see you in! Of course I’d still support you if you end up in a more common rose gold. Love you 💕
I have a feeling you are going to go a dark auburn red
I'm torn between purple, reddish orange and pink! those colors all scream Nikkie. purple isn't a warm color like the other two, but it's welcoming and comforting, but i'm sure that whatever color it is, you'll look amazing with it! <333
red @moniperez_

I’ve been feeling really anxious about my hair because as it gets longer and I transition further, my hair has been falling out alot and it gets tangled easily because it’s curly, and some of it comes off while shaving the hair growing on my face because I can’t get it lasered yet it makes me feel like less of a woman but seeing that it’s normal to have hair struggles it makes me feel alot better
Omg I swore nikkie’s hair was naturally long like that

Since you love pink and red color, i think it would be in between. I don't know it would be one or two colors. But i think you will dye sort of ombre red and pink.

Light pink 🤔🤔
Nikki suits so much with pink, purple and a little bit of blue shades sooooo much, so I expect the color of her hair to be one of these ♡♡♡♡   @succubuszsz
Naaaaah
I will love a natural red color
i'd would love for you picking any shade of green for your hair, because of the irony....but I don't think you would. So...my guess is whether pink or purple, maybe in pastels.🤞 @esmeralda_tamayo03
I remember when Kim K went platinum. If you really looked back, she hid her orange phase with having medium brown and then pink hair so she could surprise everyone with platinum.
I just wanted to guess.. purple 💜💜💜
I think you'll do a rose gold/ blush color considering in the past you had said that's something you would be open to.
Redd @jessica_chase1219
cotton candy pink! @cielo.yanez <3
I would love to see you in a pink hair look! that's my guess :)

Fall red/burgandy

PINK
Red
pink!!
Could totally see you with a bright red
i think it will be cotton pink, smth pastel for sure. since you loved your blonde hair you cant change dramatically your color and still if you dont like it, it can wash out very quickly and be removed very easily. so my bet is cotton pink, pastel pink, rose gold, smth pastel for sure   insta: @nikolrd707
Oeeeh I think something like ‘casual pink’😏
YESSSSSS I GOT IT FIRST TRY
Pink
Lilac! Because that’s my fav colour and would look great on you!!!! 😍😍😍
its gonna be orange or red  my Instagram is valeroleroo
Brown @dey.umm
I think it’s gonna be pink or violet 🤔 @rajalaur
I really thought it was gonna be strawberry blonde.
I can't decide on what color I think it'll be, so I'm not entering the contest XD That being said, though, my first guess would be a really bold, fiery red.  But then I thought about a lovely pastel lilac or lavender, and I think you'd look gorgeous with that.  But then I thought about an almost coral kinda pink, and you could totally rock that color.  But then I thought about an icey light electric blue, and that would just look stunning.  But then I thought about a deep, dark, forest-y green, and then I remembered that you don't do green, so I stopped there XD XD
I'm feeling a pale pink!!!! Orrrrr like a light brown with tons of baby lights if you're going more natural!!!    Love you girl! @karissa.porter
more blondeeee
Light pink! @lauradaniela.gallegog
I think IT will be Pink !!!

A pink would look lovely with your complexion  @Kitkatwoman89
I feel like adding some red to your hair would look amazing
Oh, uhmmm, I don't wanna look at the other comments. I don't know if you're going for a wild look or a more traditional. I think is time for a wild look, so I'm guessing something red-ish? like a wild ginger. My IG: @eaumyperfume (i'm a perfume collector :D). Anyway, you are beautiful and anything would look great on you.
my guess was rose gold, i got pretty close!
I think it'll be a rose, pink maybe slightly purple. I remember that Nikki was obsessed over a photo of her during Eurovision where her hair was  like a rose-gold colour. @potato_chromia
part of me says blue BUT I'm going with pink, I think it'll end up being pink :))
Copper would look amazing on you 🤩  @Mrsb_jnr
Purple or gray !   P.anaaaa

Me thinks it’s gonna be a periwinkle 🤔 like a lilac colour ☺️🔮💜 - jennaleannexx EDIT- now I’m looking at the black and white, why am I getting a green feeling??😂😂
When the toner was being applied you can tell it’s still light. You can see the blonde shine through and she said she wants to eat it which makes me think it’s pink. But since you can see the highlights I’m thinking a rose more than a solid pink.
Red ♥️♥️@alyshacheyenne
I reckon she's gone pink
I hope and believe it will be blue 🥺 @camtokos
I'm guessing you're going Back to Brown!
I definitely would have loved to guess that gorg rainbow but I think you'd rock a pastel purple🤩like a stunning makeup godmother fairy @ashleeymx

Ginger/red head!! @morgangelston
Candy pink!! that would suit you sooo well @annie.mp3

From the intro I can tell Nikkie won't do any drastic colour like bright red or blue or purple so.. I'm betting on strawberry blonde or tonned pink. Because they're much like her hair colour now. @jaedoesntlikeyou

when youtubers/instagrammers are like I’m going to do a !!massive!! change to my hair it’s going to go from like blond to soft baby pink that is so slightly pink it looks almost like blond so super soft baby pink 😂  Like no offence to anyone but when someone with eg. long blond hair says they’re doing a massive change, I’m thinking cutting it SHORT and changing the colour drastically but most of the time it’s just soft baby pink with the same lenght 😂🙏🏼  (@julkeaperkele)
OHH YEEES!! SO BEAUTIFULL!! ^^
Red?

i have a feelings its a pink shade, as i have noticed a few people has been doing it and im obsessed with it. Literallymelodyxo - my instagram user
Pink @frietketel
Idk why but I just feel like you’ll go with some color of pink. But whatever color you pick I know you’ll look fabulous.   Instagram: darlenechang01
Goooshhh I love it! Wish it were mine😍😍😍
I’m gonna guess pink?! 💓
I’m guessing platinum
I'm literally feeling some pink on your hair lengths 🌸 but you will be beautiful AF in every single color ✨ On Instagram I am @alicemorandi
I think dark purple or pink maybe or ( blue ) 😂😂  @itsme_majda
rose gold???
I hope you are gonna be pastel? Maybe pink maybe mint or purple could be cute   @manonamber_
Oeh I think rose gold?? I remember you talked about that colour before!!  (@irish_tealeaf)
Im guessing a red for her brother
Either Red,Pink,Platnium ????💗💗💗
Burgundy, pink, red-y realm of color lol
purple @soo.camargo
Purple
I'm thinking baby pink or purple. Like maybe a lavender or pink! Whatever the color, I'm sure it will look GORGEOUS!💕💕💕 @sassy_turdle
I thought it was red at the beginningAHHAHAHAHAH but this color's looks great on you, love it😍❤
I feel like you would rock a pink or lilac! Maybe something in between? I will stick with pink for now 🥰 (Instagram: Nora.r.o)
Light pink, obviously ☺️ Instagram: @ginapaal
rose gold or ginger
Cotton Candy Blue and Pink! 💙💗 Becouse you want to eat it!  Love You!
I'm thinking light pink or light purple but I'm leaning towards a light pink so I'm gonna say light pink my IG is Happymailover
Light pink peachy 🍑 💕  @kelbelzz27
I think you are going red, pink or strawberry blonde.🤓
light purple/ some shade of pink or pastel blue     ( _divine.cwtch._)
I think you’d look stunning as a brunette!!! With those eyes!!!!
i’m at 11:52 and i still think it’s gonna be pink
I was feeling like she was going to do brown with a color underneath it
I’m thinking pink?? Simply because i think that’s your favorite color. I know my favorite color is green & i wanna dye mine my favorite color😂 Instagram: lexagrayy
A pinkish color would fit her so much, but i honestly would hope for a blue! However.. I don't thinks she's going to get a bright or "fantasy" color just because it's her first time getting her hair died and with the fear she was showing bcs of the importance of her hair to her, I think she'll go to a more neutral ir soft pink shade!  Ig: @kirsten.draw
Red or a darker red
My guess is a lilac colour. I find it helps with toning down yellow and strawberry blonde as it washes out and  it looks great the whole time! 💜
Im actually soo excited for this!!!🤩 I think its gonna be rosegold/baby pink, but if not I'm sure whatever color u might end up choosing will look flawless on you!🥰🥰 My insta is: @spect_rea_

I think it can be rose gold hair since Nikki doesn't want to go full bright of colors. And rose gold really complements her personality and style.   artisryy

Honestly she should just get keratin fusion micro links, for her thin hair it’d be the best and they look more natural, if done correctly.

Love you! I guess purple insta @lulsnowbunny
I'm gonna guess a different shade of blonde...more highlights/lowlights, etc.
i think its pink..💗 @harshita.bali27  💘💘💘
In my opinion your hair is a natural color but that veers a bit in that extra glow mama vein. it could be a desaturated rosin that tends to neutral, however similar to a blond, I don't know, anyway certainly a crazy color but that tends to the illusion of the natural. Maybe even a reddish, always desaturated. (@palma.amlap) 💕
Rainbow
Ok so I feel it’s gonna be like a cooper natural gingerish look, and if not that would also look beautiful @luisgabrielsanchezz
A deep red of some sorts.   Instagram @vixypants

Baby pink?  Edit: OK definitely not as bright of a change that I thought it would be, but it looks gorgeous!😍

Red @lotteschuijtx

Rose Gold something in that vibe

I’m going with pink. Not a super bright pink. Something muted and cute.  IG jeremy.myg
I have no idea what color it would be, but for no reason I just want to say blue. I really don't know ehere it comes from, and I guess I;m very wrong, but blue was my first tought.
I think it’s going to be pink
My guess is that it will be rainbow 🌈
Red
here is my bet: I think she is going pink! could suit your cold undertones, you already have a light base to star, plus it´s so much fun!!! however, I do think a light caramel brown could suit you so much!! @arimarcan
Dark brunette is my guess
Heeeelo! Nikkie I think your hair color would be a transformative reddish black or sth like that.

I think that is going to be pink  Love u nikkie  Instagram: @jary_ramirez

okay so i stopped the video at 3:33 because i wanna guess and 3 is my lucky number so 8) mhhhh idk but i feel like its not something like black or brown when im being honest because, idk some experiments have to happen  i would go for either a light purple, or a light pink or rose color. these colors would fit nikkies skintone the most and i think it would overall give it a nice vibe. but when i had to decide, it would be more of a pink/strawberry type of blonde but more pink than blond lol so rose color haha @kisa.mp4
I'm 14 minutes in and I'm hoping for brunette. You're beautiful no matter what color your hair is but I think brunette will really make your eyes pop! susie.yippee is my IG handle 😊

💕 pink 💕
Probably a lilac color and @kvirginia1

Rose gold/rose pink Ig: Devin.keira
Hey nikkie!! I know you probably won’t see this but it’s worth a shot. I’m and inspiring makeup artist at only 13. I started when I was 10 and you are one of my biggest role models!! I watch all of your videos, and I learn lots of my tips and tricks from you! I just wanted to thank you, I want to be as popular and noticed from my art like you!! 🥰🥰
It’s interesting how you mention your hair is everything because it’s usually the fist thing I notice about your videos. You always have the best hair styles, I especially love it when you slick it back, I don’t know what you call that style, but it always looks super sexy and glamorous. It also has so much height and volume and reminds me of a supervillain or superhero and I love it. I can imagine Edna sitting there fitting you for your super suit and her stylist slicking your hair back
I hope its pink 💕
Pink and purple!!
Blue???  @shayla.nelson
i just watched the first three minutes of the video and i think you will coloring your hair light pink? maybe like peach idk 😭. because i remeber one time you posted on your instagram stories your hair being this color because of some lights, and i remeber you loved it 💞 ( oh i also want to try  @mmirixx🥲 )
Then dont have it rainbow for clickbait if your not that kinda girl
I think the new hair color is pink gold. tan_isa.rod
