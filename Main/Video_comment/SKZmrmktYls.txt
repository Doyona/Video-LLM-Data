*sees arthur and george are going together* *cries in utter completion of life*
We took 1,220,004 shots and This Was The Top 10 (Gets half of the UK to take shots)
Ollies humor is underrated he is funny
Fosh was cooking ngl
I need editor number have got a lot to learn
Chris's no.3 goal  was filthy
Why couldn’t we see sunburnts one
Jack Joseph! Love bro's content
The ambulance when Theo came through the portal bro
did they split the money at the end?
Oxlade chamberlain
why is ally law actually a professional
At 14:37 is the ball boy wearing a Wolves Kit?
Bro got the entire of football YouTubers in one video
Ethans' goal near the end was better than most of them
Theo Baker thinking he scored the best weak foot goal then the goal after by chris:
So glad I won
This is one of my go to vids
Cringe
Chrismd's vlogs are at a higher level!!! woaaaaaaah
11:08
chris's volley with ethan is number 1 but he cant win
my dad plays better than these "professionals/freestyle" ballers
08:25 otoya ahh
Dude kahn or however you spell his name has gotten fit as heck!
8:43 so nasty
7:12 that shot was nasty sad it didn’t go in
Kris zijn bewerker heeft 'n verhoging nodig
problably one of the best football videos ive seen
Ppl who thinks chrises number 3 should have won 👇
3 was an absolute screamer
3 things are guaranteed in life: birth, death, and Harry's mum getting hit in the face in a ChrisMD video
9:45 does anyone know the name of the music?
0:21 power rangerssss
Did not expect romell
16:03 that should’ve been top 10
The goalkeeper is useless
2800th comment
Im here for Joe weller
To be honest number 4 is better than 1
22:24 has to be the best goal Chris has ever scored
Does anyone know the name of the song on the number 3 chrismd shot please if anyone knows let me know
Chris' number 3 goal was actually just the best goal in the video that's hilarious that he lowkey won his own challenge.
would have loved to see Kieran Brown in this. Great vid tho!
Who is watching in 2025
What about the top 10 worst one's?
The list is fked tbh😂😂
5:30  bro sounded like a bot 😂
That CANNONSHOT fired by Jon is the best goal here IMO, I just love power shots like that
It is so fittint that it was 2 lads wanting to split the prize, one shot after the other, there can be absolutely no grumbles there.
15:33 low key quality
And personally the 3rd is better
If that’s 1 I’m 0
i think chris his 3rd place one should win it
1:44 No look rabona penalty 🗿
The video was great except for the sh*ttiest music selection I’ve ever heard
If only tbjzl was here
Number 6 was 🔥
Anyone saw the brommapojkar shirt?
21:00 warra goal
chris editor is insabe
Those calves?😂😂😂
That was a class vid.😜🤙
Big John Deserved It 😢
Seeing Romell made me so happy  TGF and Childish for life!!
Joe sugg went to my secondary school
Chris's goal was definetly the best, but winners were deserved.
4:34 that was a funny one
if simon was here he would've won easily
Simon wasn’t in the vid cause Chris knows he would’ve been spots 1-10 for best goals
Intro out of this world
24:46, made me sad
Love how Kon thinks his calves are weird, just because his are more defined than most...no Kon that's how everyone else's should look too 😅

Cole's intro line had me in stitches
5:51 he was falling for so long
No Limit😍
0:01 let me be in a video pls
Slammmmed❤
Are we not going to talk about Ollie’s photo in the video?
14:23 what a save holy
19:22 thank me later
Inbetweeners is goated
Wow Max 👌
Where's Tobi and Simon when you need them
This video made me feel like I was in highschool again especially with Joe
this came out on my bday
last 2 goals def just plummeted the goalies ego
9:42 😂
Should have done a top 10 and then reveal #1
They should not of been the top 2 goals
Up sharky’s melb city pants🤌🤌
8:17 the two greatest misses ever
song name 21:30?
You should do top ten saves to
goerge + arthur >>>>>
4:02 Chris is not possibly 5'8"
Where’s Steven Tries 😢  “KALBENHAYIIIIIN”
I can’t stand pie face he’s so annoying
Keepers were amazing
13:10 Max :)
The intro. Nice.
Im falling for so long XDDDDDD
Harold's jersey is fire og Croatia 🔥🔥🔥
Watching george and arthur and joe and caspar in this video makes me realise how similar they are
Wish DanTDM or Kieran Brown was in this😢
Jack Joseph and CAJ are the funniest from the bunch
Look at alll thossseee tossers
Jo weller is on steroids
We need to see more of Joe Weller
How long would it take to edit! Great video.
Up there with one of the best football videos ever
literlly the shitest goals won
if you ask me, that weak foot volley was #1 mate. what strike
I’ve watched this video 4 times and just realised the fact Chris has doctor stranges eye around his neck at the start of the vid
Why did jay say Romell Henry for when romell introduced himself💀
Chris knew the video would be all Simon if he brought him into the vid, so he brought Simon's doppelganger, Mr. Dixon
nah minter had em
doesn't get more chris than him putting himself not one not two, but three times! in the top 10
What. A. Video! 👏🏼 Favourite goal was the nr. 6 one but all top 10 was 👌🏼 The most surprising thing for me was the shirt cameo of Swedish club Brommapojkarna 🤯😆
the ultimate collab video
Nah bro big Jon’s was the best shot
Wish there was a bit more cam in it
shot 1573 was nice
banger vid
Does anyone know the song named player at 19:45 ?
Theo’s weak foot was way better than Chris’s
Wait I thought harry was the “Guernsey gobbler”
It’s so amazing when half of the British YouTube comes together for a video ❤️💪🏻 Americans would never do that… rat race and that
Oscar for best VFX goes to this video
Anyone else miss Joe Weller after seeing this vid
Romel Henry has some insane curl on his shot
Chris could probably beat the entire England team with Southgate’s tactics and player choices. 😂😂
What happened to Ollie the last video I saw of Ollie was the takeaway one
Omg why does ollie look so much like kdb 😭
JCCs goal was too low
tbjzl??
We all just wanted Simon 😢😂
Big up Kon for his transformation and making it to top 10
imagine if billy and jeremy were in this💀💀💀
4.108k is a random number
never thought i would see cole and chris in a vid together but here we are hahaha
Everyone's talking about the editing but the goalkeeping in this video is 😍😍
i wanna see the bottom 10 shots lol
The most underrated guy on YouTube.
What happened to Max's Goals ❓
Idk if it’s just me but big John looks like aubameyang 😂😂
the bit with joe and casper hahahah the cut offs are so funny
The stoke guy cm on love you stoke
8:42 wtf was that?
the starting youtubers entering edit is insane
keepers where popping off
I was waiting for a simon and tobi duo to turn up and end the video, glad to see it thrown back to UK youtube Royalty
22:00 weakfoot trivela volley
The background for the people is hilarious like harry coming from a brexit rally.
Bro summoned the football multiverse 😂
the fact that theo showed up from the hospital😂
w vid
“Jack Maates happy hour” 😂😂
Personally I think Chris's goal for 3rd was the best
Whos here after miniminters video ?
Where Simon
miroslav stoch would be proud
15:52 I love them
Tubes is a baller I wish we saw more of his goals.
How has number 6 not finished higher than he did?
Na thé simon edit in the end is elite
wish I’d seen more of romell in football challenges, it’s crazy to me how much curl he manages to get on his shots
Dani Aaron’s was the best
How has ollie gotten this fat
8:39 was the best goal imo best volley iv seen on this channel
Big up Kon!!! He’s my winner
Im not gay but hes hot
The one in all black who hit it with his bum is he the dad of tekkerz kid
Do you have a girlfriend?
if simon went it would’ve been wrapps
PieFace's weight loss is really what is absolute class 😎🍻
Cole Anderson 😂
ChrisMD great content my friend and even greater edits.
Chris' promotions are the only ones i dont skip
Bro, if Simon was there....
Jack falling over like a gta 5 character has me rolling
just giving my opinion, I think that Ethan his goal should also be in the top 10, maybe not win but surely top 10
10:35 that clip with the Gary Neville bit as well is incredible 😂
i loved seeing joe and casper, them + oli were my childhood and now i love christ and that
Chris’ goat at #3 was better
Easily one of the best YouTubers Chrismd, love the way he’s getting all the Uk YouTubers together, especially Joe weller big respect
i thought Harry's intro would be: if i score a crazy goal, will you finger my bum
Amazing editing....we are just getting started and our latest video is the best yet but a way to go to get to your level. Keep it up 👏
Goated Editor
top 10 19:28
7:28 from going on about the muscle, to running from the shot with that music😭😭 im dead
The intro deserves an Oscar
A video about a bunch of nerds who can't kick a ball.....with nearly 3 million views?
chris's trivela volley was better tbh
editing so funny
Quality video, the editing was next level. This vid was a banger in a long while enjoyed it 🙌🏼 The ending 🥹
that advert transition was smooth
The intro is wild
The miniminter at the end was such a funny edit
4:55
Your goals were better ngl...
Again using koven in this video go on Chris 💪💪
Laughed hard at the opera advert lol hahahaha
Imagine if Harry just posted some of this lot on his channel- he's in more friends videos than his own.
The ambulance 😂😂
This is like a decade of UK YouTube thrown into 1, class
What a video
miniminter shouldve been in the vid it wouldve been insane
the crossbar at 1:35 was insane
chris you  little legend
make a video with armando broja
love the peep show clips #classic
half top ten not in vid lol
The Simon cameo at the end is class, had to spare everyone from another easy miniminter W
I wish I could like this video more than once
Who came here from mustys video 👇
l
I love the Bez laugh
Ngl chris goal was clearly no.1
I wish Simon and tobi were also here
Song at 5:44?
Goldbridge ain’t 29
I love when they didn’t show us the goal
6 is better than 2 and 1
The most impressive part was the number of balls that went over the fence, never to be seen again
Let’s be honest Chris’s post and in goal was the best
Simon in the end 😭
WHAT A VID!!
Weller is so goated, caspar and sugg throwback was nice too
What’s the song played over Theo’s goal at the end?
Editor = 🐐, also Chris’ ad transitions are always hilarious
Love the vid, but icl that last goal did not deserve the 4 grand, mid af
21:48 That was not better lol
jack and cole are too funny
The "IT'S IN MI EY" at 23:56
The ending tho?!? We were all waiting for the real MM7!! Give us Simon!!
Why does minister look so sad?
all it’s missing is louis
The number 3 goal was pure filth
Top 2 just weren’t better than others
I thought #6 until the back to back  banger 😂
Best intro I’ve ever seen
What a goal to end to a insane video
What is the song during Theo bakers top 10 goal?! I can’t find it anywhere
Johns technique is so satisfying
i strive for a phone book like this
What jumper brand is that ginger fella wearing at 24:24
The goat uploads again🔥🔥
Do another nerf war
Agree with the winner but I think goal number 8 should have been a lot higher. It was such a sweet strike, the floaty volleys don't do it for me
NOOO SIMON AT THE END LMAO
Chris  You should do a freekick challange  vs Billy wingrove  That would be amazing
Just perfect for football fans… 💀
there are so many others for part 2.. cant wait for it
34 people
Tom Garratt robbed how did he only get one shot 😂
What's the song called at 17:37, can't find it in the description
THIS IS YOUTUBE
I swear Chris invited every relevant YouTuber at the moment 😂
Anyone got the song for 21:05.
Come on Arsenal
These shots would be impressive if it was an actual match,  or he had somebody defending during. Anyone can do these by themselves.

Do this part 2 with simon & tobi
5:53 moment of the video
joe wankller appearance
I'll be honest I don't usually watch football videos all the way through. This one however is probably the best youtuber football video on the internet. GOATED. Put this video in the youtube football hall of fame.
poor simon
Smithy and Joe were class in this video, it was like a pair of Premier League footballers going up against a bunch of Sunday League players. Sure the others had solid moments, but their chemistry and skill just shows the class they’ve got
hahahah the simon ending
"4 GRAND and I need to buy petrol as well!"
Never thought I'd see the day where a member of TGF would be in a ChrisMD video, but I'm all for it and it's a collab I didn't know I needed until now. Nice to see Joe Weller and Caspar Lee again too, I feel like they haven't really been about in quite some time
WTF where is Eithan shot it was insane !!
How does Romell get so much curve when he strikes the ball, bros ankles are mad flexible
Get noahsnoah in
Can we have a 3 hour version pls
Oli’s been eating more than being in goals
8th best goal is massively underrated
Do u still live in jersey chris
Might aswell give the money to editor, what an intro
I don’t really watch a lot of ChrisMD videos (as I don’t really have an interest in football). But Chris, thank you, thank you for having Joe Sugg, Caspar Lee, and Joe Weller all in the same video. My childhood thanks you!
Ending scene was nuts. Give ur editor a raise NOW
what a video.
Joe and Caspar greatest duo!!!
where's simon at
What's the song playing when Cal's introduced??
The edit at the end tho
agree with that volley for the number 1 spot! take a bow!
Bro Casper and Joe !!! the golden days !
so many people missed Simon at the end
Casper and Joe suggest were the best in this video 2nd was Arthur and George
I love harry's Croatian shirt Respect!
I’d love to see more of Romell and Cole on here, they’re so funny 😂
Anyone else skip Joe Weller?
I feel so bad for the editor
That’s actually nice of Chris to not let Simon participate so that everyone else has a fair chance at the $4K
should consider making a video inviting a couple lucky subscribers to join you in a video
Doritos wolves shirt on show… love it! WAW!
The ending is lmao epic 😂😂😂🎉🎉🎉🎉
What video 😂😂😂 as **
Better be giving that sponsor money to the editor
I took that much in my whole life
Tbh chrises one that came third was the best
Anyone else think Theo’s weak foot goal in the top ten should have been after Chris 😂🥴🫢
Song at 21:22 isn’t credited , can some one tell me the name ????
Intro was absolutely fire
missing simon minter……. would’ve made the video even more unreal!!!
Wellers back!
Best Chris vid ever
Thomlinson doing FD proud
started watching you again, so wierd seeing you swear lmao
Joe is still my favourite 😂
I think he deliberately avoids bringing Simon in, because he would outclass Chris!
This has got to be one of the best intros and outros i've ever seen
Locura
Realistically chris won with number 3 but he couldn’t win😅
No Miniminter is a crime
jcc's  goal was unreal
That last goal is insane
Mark Goldbridge, 29... Hilarious😂
top 10 goals would have been all miniminter if he was there🤣😂
21:28 song name?
Videos like this gives me nostalgia of being 12 13. Only Chris does this
"Im a great goal scorer, not a scorer of great goals" is everything id want from a striker
#1 was naughty the power on the slow motion that was pure poetry amazing
6 was unbelivable i cant believe it was that low!!!
elf bars😭😭😭😭😭
I don’t know what’s more world class: the editing of the video or the goals in the video
Minter at the end 😂
Tubes has got mad teckers 😂 honestly forgot
number 6 was top 3 for me, what a shot
That ending had me in stitches! "Who forgot to invite Captain UK to the YouTuber Football Avengers?!?"
We know what you did, you can hide it but the internet will always remember.
@ChrisMD are you not disappointed you’ve been on YouTube for 8 years and still got less that 6million subs?
Joe Weller is allowed nowhere near the Amex after wearing that shirt
the biggest group in the u could never do this for some reason..simon one of the biggest uk youtubers is too scared to ask  ppl to come on his podcast...but chrismd can pull the avengers of youtube..everyone.. for a 20 min football video..where alot of them dont even play football at all. the sidemen gotta step up.. could have massive, epic and hilarious game shows and crazy videos. not even just youtubers..internet stars and more.. brought to us in great duos and arrangement i mean its just class
20:16 is outrageously sweet! That was my winner but only because Chris isn't allowed to win 😂22:27 was big Ramsey vs. Gala vibes.
What an intro 👏🏻👏🏻
best YouTube vid I've seen in a long time, editing was unreal and the stacked lineup speaks for itself. smithy's banger was a deserved winner
pieface wearing an argyle shirt
i thought joe sugg and casper lee were the same person
20:30 Crazy…
3rd goal was best
Weller >
debatable top 5
not miniminter at the end...💀😆
Need a part 2
song at 21:28 ?
No doubt on the number 1. Absolute class video Chris, this one deserves an award.
the end😂what happened to simon??😂😂
Editor🎉
Okay that 1st place goal is undeniably the best one in the video, what an absolute pearler.
Surely JCC’s strike was the best out of them. Absolute worldie from him 😂
WHERE IS SIMON?? He should’ve been in this!! I know he is very busy and it might not have worked but ohhh comeee onnnn he would’ve given you a worldy
Beautiful balls
Seeing Simon at the end I know there will be another video ……..
Nah the Simon cameo had me creasing
The end hahahahah
DO BETTER!
Seeing Simon in the end….
Big john low-key insane
Do better
Do better a****le.
Tobi's knuckleball underrated that was pure filth
Simon's face at the end 🤣
You’re about to get Swolled
Amazing vid but no Simon
im liking the video because of that transition to the add read
so I'm assuming this cost $8k 4k for the winner and 4k to simon to not include any of his footage as he got all 10 in the top 10. A classic Christoph manoeuvre
Chris with a beard looks like a guy that owns all Star Wars figurines
Elite video
Toby's knuckleball slyly underrated but quality vid all round
Joe Weller, YouTube legend
The keeper highlights are arguably as impressive as the goals
Simon at the very end 😭😭
How did behzinga not get in too ten
No Simon or Tobi
MAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARK
Joe welller is just so un-funny in every way
Think this is the best football video I've watched in my life, no really.🔥🔥
I think Theo won?
Ollie has become disgraceful
The Simon edit at the end had my dying haha
for me number 6 would have won ç
Tubes is a baller.
I liked purely for the Dr Strange edit, we'll see what the rest of the vid is like :)
The ambulance for Theo's entrance at the beginning was crazy.
Great vid
how do you feel shannon won't be texting u for 14 day?
nice vid
I wasn’t prepared for this sensory overload
100% agree. What a great ending to the video
miniminter robbed
Wherever you are mate, thnks so much for all the wonderful moments I've had watching your videos... Its been one of the reasons i didn't quit football no matter how tough things got personally. You're an inspiration with funny moments along side the bois and the Sidemen and they are an absolute joy to watch.
Plz do a part 2. The editing was fantastic,the amount of YouTubers was spectacular, and it really was not just hilarious but hugely thrilling seeing those goals at the end. Honestly mate that was class.👏👏👏
Besides number 1, the list is f*****
Anyone else want to see the top 10 saves?
Like how the Football channels/podcasts were shite
Do a video of your top 10 goals of all time
What a banger of a video! Amazing shots and banter between the lads, love this content, keep it up!   Simon at the end made me kinda sad, guarantee he would be in top 10 :D
Great editing
Shame no ginge, also great to see joe still funny as ever
We needed better players
AAAA A STOKEEYYYY
genuinely the most cleverly edited video ive ever seen, props to the editor. the peep show references were a particular highlight
Ally law had a glow up 💀
Jack and Cole were hilarious. More of them please 😂🔥
Chris knew if he brought Simon/Miniminter he would just win it
24:46 is it really...no it can't be...Simon...has he returned...?
best youtuber ever
It's depressing being a Manchester United fan and seeing Internet Personalities being more clinical in front of goal than our strikeforce!
Rated perfectly. If anyone says he favortited himself they are delusional 😂
Crazy goals
We need a part two with simon tobi and manny
That jcc goal was insane
Weller was jokes in this
This has nothing to do with the video but.. Just seen Shannon on LOCKED IN and FAM!! Talk about a GLOWUP...Time to play some catch up lad, go get some botox and hit the gym.. we believe in you
simon at the end was hilarious
Beautiful video that made me smile!
this is the greatest vid you've put out
The harry's mom edit LITERALLY had me on the floor bruh
Caspers goal off the cross bar 😮
Tom Garratt criminally underused
The goals were amazing, the saves were crazy but the editing was on spot on!!!!!!!
Wolves doritos kit 🔥😍
Johns should’ve been higher
The editor NEEDS a raise! Great Video
WELLERRRRR
What a creator
I’m sorry but Chris’s goal was the best
Nice to see joe on a collaboration
Simon is coming
Shot power next time
Wow his videos have improved in quality so much
Reckon Jon got done dirty here, he was for sure top 3. But yeah that top goal was just untouchable!
Brilliant video, been loving the editing on Chris's videos for many years, this is fantastic! 🔥🔥
Where the frick is Danny Aaron’s
W vid
100% desvered, loved the second goal!
Insane
Love it
Genuinely one of the best vids ive seen on Youtube in a while
come on the TUBESSS GOLF LIFE BABBBY
ArthurTV has my heart hahaha what a legend
W2S start making videos again bro🤥
legendary video mate.
When Joe and Chris hugged and Chris said thank you for coming 🥹
7:14 underrated volley
Where is Danny Aarons??😮😮😮😮
awesome but i hate joe weller
The editing and to have this many YouTubers altogether! What a collaboration! 😂
Ollie is a unit
clicked the vid for suggy and caspar idk why 😭
ive come back everday to watch the 1st place goals since upload and this could be a culture classic
Bro I knew something was off, WHERE IS SIMON
All these Twitter football fans can’t even kick a ball, says all you need to know
Tubes is the modern day Paul Scholes
GOOSEBUMPS
The Chris had the best goal
the final 2 goals gave me goosebumps
goal #6 was robbed. shoulda been way higher
It would definitely be unfair if the GOAT was there! (24:44 for reference)
Needed some 5ive guys!
14:12 There's no way that isn't Ally Law
Imagine the hours of footage 😂😅
who needs doctor strange when you have CHRISMD
Where's wingrove and Jezza?
What a video Chris, 24 minutes of pure creative quality
👏👏👏
until i saw number 1 i was confused at how 6 didnt win it tbh
Kon's fitness journey and transition is insane th
Cole and jack make me cry🤣🤣🤣
Seeing Joe and Casper is a throw back🤣haven’t seen a video of theirs in years
that was better than Zidane's volley
Your best yet...
bro just casually dropped the sickest collaboration video
Thats a lot of alcohol
Number 6 should have been number 2....
JCC being in this gives me hope for a future collab with FNG
best ending ever
WOW LOOK AT THAT PIGEON
I think joe could make a comeback easily
19:32 for top 10 goals
I think we need another trip to Monaco
happy to see Joe back amongst it
We need tobi in this
Your dad looks like he could be reeves brother 😅😅😂
Chris must have had the best summer of his life filming this.
Romell got the finesse+ play style
The only thing missing from this vid was simon
Smithy 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
WHY is stokey here hahahhaah
Best one was Chris md weak foot I think no4
Chris scored the best goal number 3
UTR what r u doing put Jon up top
brilliant vid!!!
The editor deserves a raise after this masterpiece
Big up Buvey🤩
Great to see in this time of austerity and inflation when most people are struggling massively 4 thousand quid being given to the truly needy.
Editor needs double pay for this
Class video!
They need to invite vicoss and thib'z
cant lie i forgot about joe weller
john is so cold😭
as per usual... chris wins his own video. class to not take the win tho
joe weller goat
PROBABLY THE GREATEST FOOTBALL VIDEO I'VE EVER SEEN
Chris number 3 goal was cold
W editor
Idgaf, Joe Sugg Rainbow Flick volley side net goal is my number 1.
ROMELL!!!!! TGF TGF
3:48 I’m dying 😂
Need the Irish guy in one of these
chris you should do 100 shots with Simon only and see if he scores a better goal
One of the best yt videos this year
unreal video
if miniminter was there
I think Joey’s goal should’ve been 4th for sure behind MD’s goal and the back to back
The goosebumps on the number 1 shot!!
goalkeepers did very well
respect to editors gg
The movement Romell gets on the ball is mad
Con is not fat anymore and he is also wearing ASICS in a football video
Uk YouTube is king
Shoutout to Harry for that Croatia 98’ kit 🔥🇭🇷
This is the best video of all time
I don’t know what’s a bigger crime. Smithy turning up in long socks or him calling them “long sleeve socks” 😂
This is a class video 👏🏾👏🏾damn I need to be drafted in next time so I can knick some change😉😏 that ending aswell 🔥🔥 elite football video
ZIDANE
@3:00 “cooking time” 😂
editing masterpiece this
Chris why don't you try and get a colab with my cousin plays for tranmere rovers jake leake
great vid Chris, great guests except joe weller he is a clown
honestly, some of the saves in this video are absolutely outrageous 🔥
mad video, fair play chris
Top vid, Avengers UK
Best hobit video yet
Lad in the Doritos wolves shirt 😍
your vids are top tier honestly
Masterpiece from Chris and his team
Joe Weller literally has not changed at all since I last watched him
Haha poor Simon at the end
Banger chris
its embarrassing you didnt get simon in
Absolute VINTAGE Chris md
Love the simon at the end cause chris knows we always want minter in the football videos
Absolutely amazing video!
bro that shot at 8:42 is so crazy
I could throw you so far
ChrisMD’s intro>>>>> Avengers End Game
simon😂😂
This video, is YouTube football ‘eritage 👌
having joe & caspar feels like such a weird crossover for like 2015 me
What a video Chrismd is a goat of yt
Missed weller in these type of vids so much
great video, rlly wish simon was in it but overall one of the best videos ive seen all year.
No Danny Aarons?
Weller getting caved in by Behz
john's goal severely underrated
He almost finished saying “I’m falling for so long” before he actually fell
Who let the guy that takes his out tweets and then puts them on instagram like everything he says is comedy gold in the video. Stokey we are looking at you mate
Weller 🐐
Goldbridge deserved more screen time. Plus, that goal was top 2 and not 2
That intro tho
Glad too see casper back
casper lee and joe was amazinig
#1 SCREAMS Zizou
Alternate title : CrisMD took 4,108 shots and the top 10 are INSANE
Anybody else watch until Tom Carrot was on, then turned it off before weller came on?
Pie face and goldbridge what an unbreatable duo 😂😂😂 laughed hard watching them
Honestly I’ve said it so many times there are barely any people on this platform with better editing than chris’ videos the music is just incredible as well
Much like Chris, Simon wasn’t allowed to win it either
Joe and Caspar!! Throw back to make the video
Tubes is an absolute baller
One of the best videos I’ve seen this year 😂
JCC robbed, the moment on the ball was insane.
JOE WELLER
16:39 the Gurning goal scorer more like
What a video 🫡
😮
lol
Naaa. Those last 5 goals were insane bro wtf.
#3>
John’s goal is top 5
that intro proved this vid was an avengers level threat
Top tier intro. Top 2 I fully agree with. Joe Sugg shockingly might have been robbed of a top 10 place.
Stokey boyyyyy
Omg jaackmaates joke on this had me crying with laughter 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
what a video
Need to do 5000 shots of the best YouTube footballers in the UK get the dream team
Hate the editing.
Joe Weller and Casper Lee? What is this, the YouTube retiree club?
One of the best YouTube football videos in a long time, maybe even ever 🤔
https://youtu.be/WLnIMdO1_Jc?si=MCDRQkt9qMITu8UZ
#3 was the best of the lot if you know ball
14:36 mans got a solid Wolves top on in the background there!!!
Iconic
Bro said f### up theis challenge 😂😂😂
missed weller, need a full video with him
Banger
The uncomfortable irony that I'm watching Doctor Strange in the background then put this video on scared and confused my soul.
I'm pretty sure we all wanted Arthur and Danny taking the shots together
WTF WAS ROMELL'S SHOTS, the curve on them...ridiculous
another top video from md
Number 3 was the best tbh ❤
Unpopular opinion but Theo’s weak foot shot was a better than Chris’
minter  looked kind of  sad at the end i wish that he was in the video but it was still very fun to watch.  i wounder if he was doing something better then being in the video? also amazing as always :)
Goldbridge was 29 2 decades ago
Ever since Simon said Harry is losing his volley skills, it’s all I think about when he’s in a football vid
How was I still hooked while watching the Opera ad
W South Africa
the editing of the intro is 🤯
I could sense the sorrow in Chris's voice when replying to callux  😂2:33
Whoever edited this deserves the  prize money. Its pure brilliance
There's no way thats the best goal
My beast analytics show mouths clothes make for better performing thumbnails. Better change it mr chris
no way romell is in this vid
The happy hour music over JackMaates shots sent me🤣🤣
13:58 that peep show reference is outrageous
What a bloody class video
nahhhh simon was trully miss in this video
Loved the video Chris, it was nice to see a wide variety of Creators/YouTubers all in one video. Jack Joseph & Cole Anderson hilarious duo
That editor is disgusting, oh my days
Ollie saving goals while Chris saving YouTubers channels
JCC ROBBED
chris is like the only guy as phonk as background music in a long form youtube video.
First commercial I have ever finished in yt videos...
your videos get better and better. keep up all the guests please
Simon in the end! 😭😂😂
Poor simon😂
Best editor on youtube, congrats to whoever you are👌
I rate Chris so much but please don’t bring tik tokkers here 🤬
Qualifying criteria to be in this video:  A: Lives in the UK B: Has released a minimum of 1 piece of content in lifetime
Been waiting for this for sooo long! 🙌🏼
No by cycle :(
Joe and Casper made this 😂
Hilarious! What was the score? 🤔
So Chris really doesn't know any women?
no way Harry has a Croatian Jersey omg pozdrav iz hrvatske
What a video son. Top tier
Chris, Harry is in 12 of your last 20 thumbnails / videos. isnt it time to start leaching off of someone else for a change?
Yes it's nice to have seen the 10 best goals from 4000 shots at goal, surely there has to be 10 absolute class saves though, what about a nice compilation of those too.
The song in the intro 🔥 NO LIMIT
Is that weller?
This is why I love arthurtv Danny wasnt with him and he’s catching heat
Chris' best shot number 3 was absolutely filthy. If this wasn't his competition, and if Smithy didn't hit it on the back to back, he definitely would have won it. Great vid.
It's almost impossible to make a YouTube football video better than this one...WOW
It has a post credit scene!
would have been the perfect video for josh to actually fulfil his promise of being a chrismd video but alas twas not the one
Theo's ambulance and Cal's giraffe enclosure had me
The George and Arthur section was so short 😭
So great
Bingus
Does anyone know the song at 21:30 ?
The fact that Joe Sugg, Caspar Lee and Joe Weller got invited to this is cool
3:10 something is cooking ….. I don’t think you can actually cook 🥲😂
Surprised he kept those racist pricks Jack Joseph and Cole in the video.
Unbelievable scenes!
7:53 best duo
5:25 the collab we definetly needed amd deserved
Anyone else think Chris’s goal at number 3 was the best?
The best football video of 2023!!
9:18 get this goalkeeper signed. he went crazy with some of the saves in this video!
Charlie Morley we need you
Unbelievable, the editor absolutely slapped in this video 👏
#4 was absolutely not top 5 but the rest were pretty awesome icl
Going back to the Sidemen "YouTubers rate themselves" video to make sure Chris was first for best youtuber
where is minter
Joe and ethan
Kon got so Lean I thought It was Reev
Ollie looks like eaten Ollie
Chris’s #3 should’ve won.
22:21  song name please? 🙏
It's like the Avengers of autistic British virgins
class video
So. Are we not going to talk about the smoothest transition ever at 3:50?😂
banger like always
Early contender for YouTube video of the year this
JCCs #6 goal was the best imo
Chris’ half volley was better than the #1 and #2 by far
The intro though 😤🔥 tuff
Class
Joe weller 🎉
big johns was no1 for me
bro the bit with harry's mum. genius
And buvey has the nerve to talk about football 😂😂
Nice to see joe back in the mix
Video of the year
Simon not being here is a disgrace
those last 2 goals were naughty... especially that last strike. On the turn, just watched it beautifully and the swerve taking it away from the keeper was faaaaaaaanntastic!
Make more videos with Ben foster
Editor Rocks! ❤
Chris goals were the better ones
that was not the top goal . Chris's top 3rd goal deserved first place
The greatest intro to a YouTube video.. Ever
You should do the same video idea with subscribers, visit different locations potentially across the UK north south midlands wales etc and then have it the best goal was scored by said locations👏👏👀 #shotgunbeingthereforwales 🤣
Ye why wasn’t Simon featured
Number 1 reminds me of Andros Townsend, what a hit
Smithy and Joe can kick ball like that???
Nah but seeing Joe Casper and also Joe was jokes, poor minter tho
That ending with that face of Simon 😂😂😂
Joe Weller ❤
Joe and Caspar were jokes 😂
Harry in a vintage Croatian kit... Makes me really really happy
anyone talking about how clean the transition to the ad was😂
great video andfor me chris 3rd spot goal is the best just my opinion
was worth the 1 month wait
Max is such an underrated baller
Where's Danny
Kon got freaking JACKED
bro the editing on this is crazy
Perfect opera transition mate.
we need cole and joseph in more vids
Not having Simon and tobi here is a crime
this video gave me genuine happiness
ethans shots were taken at my sunday league pitch lol
Biggest YouTube Collab of All time.. has to be
Omg romell 😂 yesss
Seeing jackmate and joe with them makes me so happy. He’s such an og alongside the elders of YouTube U.K.
He summoned the multiverse of iconic yt footballers 😂
Johns goal should be number 4
Fok yea Harry
ayo am i the only one now only realising the amount of weight Kon has lost
great video! alot of work paid off
Where’s Danny Aarons ???
GOLDBRIDGE!!!!!
Respect to the actors of this video, you are the best 💗
bros got basically very football related youtuber on 1 video
wow what a video,appreciate the effort this must have taken👏👏👏
Huge smile on my face at the end of the vid, this was brilliant
What about Simon and tobi
Biggest crossover since endgame
The king of YouTube football content ⚽️👑
one of the greatest videos
Great video but what this also tells me is Chris doesn't know any women
Possibly one of the best football yt vids I’ve ever watched tbh
Genuinely so happy for Smithy, what an unsung hero is the media scene. From ‘I do love playing away’ to being Chris’ #1 goal, what a legend
Ethan thanking Chris for the invite. Class act!
I've not liked ChrisMD's videos recently because of the vulgar jokes but this one is great
I’m glad you edited out my other shots
That last Simon edit shows that there will be a sequel with him joining as a new main character 🤔😏
🐐
love how giddy they all get after scoring beautiful goals
Lmfao Simon would’ve 100% won if he made an appearance
They deffo did not take 40108
Ollie has put on a few 😂
You can't write this script. Levels🎉
5:52
i like the layout of this video and i liked the simon teaser at the end
More weller please 😂
Miniminter at the end😢
Tobi and Simon would’ve done better.
Chris never fails to drop an absolute banger 👌🏻
YouTube video of the year without doubt
Goated vid!
it’s nice to see mello doing well. guys had a tough few years.
Best vid yet
Unreal editing!
Possibly the best football video intro in YouTube history that
Tubes is a such a baller
shame chris cant win his own vids, no 3 wins
If only you had invited the best on the ball player Arsène wenger had ever seen circa 2007, this video could’ve reached new heights.
ok that intro was fireee
“The guernsey goal scorer” I think we’ve had that one before.
Didn’t realise chris has this many mates
I think Chris goal at 3 is the best
If simon was involved, he'd definitely have won the cash prize
Chris's videos are like mini movies
Love the peep show memes
It's nice to see Weller in a fotball video
Great video, that one goalie was insane
number 8 took it for me, what a screamer
YOOO Croatia mentioned
Im sorry but i nearly spat my tea out with the "as my mum calls it.....breakfast" underrated line!
Uncut!!! Uncut!!! Uncut!!! Uncut!!!
Theo needs to pay up
masterpiece
What a video 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
Like assembling the avengers
Editing is top notch, great vid Chris!
Kons calf’s > grealish calf’s 7:28
Well done and thank you for not including Danny Aarons
Chris casually brought the entire uk 😂
One of the best videos I’ve ever watched .
keeping youtube football relevant
Such an amazing video!!🔥🔥🔥
Chris does the best football videos in Youtube hands down
I swear chrisMD never misses, bros the Mr. Beast of UK yt
I just got severe flashbacks seeing Joe Sugg and Casper.
He’s gone into the multiverse and got 2014 Joe Weller back
Goldbridge 29 🫢
That weak foot volley was FILTH
Chris knew he would be paying Simon if he was involved
Christopher Dixon......This might be some of your greatest work yet....wow <3
Got tubes off the golf course, thats no  easy feat!!
literally everyone lmao
Simon at the end 😂
Bro, I hope Opera helped a lot w licensing all of that music lol
Nice to see romell in the vid
Best collab of the year
Yeo Chris going crazy eh
Chris has outdone himself with this one!
Chris number 3 goal is his best of all time, it’s vile
Honestly I thought Joe Thomlinson’s goal was the best one
actually great video
This may be the greatest YT football content of all time.
Chris' videos are what I mean when I say boys will be boys 😂 always a fun watch even though I know nothing about football!
Gotta say I'm a little disappointed you didn't include any women in this video. Would have been pretty easy to find a few women who were much more capable than a few of these guys.
Tom garrat went missing
Soooo many people love it
saturday social got tekkers
Wolves Doritos top ⚡️⚡️
Where's Danny Aaron's
Number 6 should be way higher
Best goals won, and back to back. Editor well done. Last clip of simon was amazing 😅
Weller is such a goat
Dont think I’ve laughed at editing as much in one video as this one
Oh SHII
At 7:27 the glazing is crazy
Chris has turned regular YouTube football to something else. It's like watching a movie. Arguably the best footballing video I've seen on YouTube 🖐🏾
What a video!! Amazing
Simon😢
Yesssss Joe!!! Finally seeing you back on more videos 🙌🏼
They need thibz and viccos
Thanks for making this video
24:43
Ayo seeing Caspar and Joe playing football with Chris is so surreal hahah
The top spot is well deserved, 2 back to back bangers 🔥
Johns was a banger
I think yt football has just peaked
Tubes cameo was definitely the best 😂
Simon, Tobi, Manny, Spencer, Big thick thigh Stephen tries, KSI, Daniel Cutting, Kieran Brown in the next one?
This vid was amazing😮
Fun Fact: Simon was originally in the video but he took all 10 spots so he had to be cut out
Hahaha aww poor Simon! you need tobi and manny, chunks and filly in the next one!
Hands down best video I’ve watched in ages 👏🏼
19:27 top 10 goals
Loved seeing sugg Casper and weller
Wheres Simon????
What happened to ollie
Literally thought aa putting vid there'll be an editing related commebt and its literally the top one… (bar oinned)
simon... :(
Great video. Nice to see joe seller as well tbh
Max Fosh got cakes!
song at 18:48?
AW i miss seeing caspar and joe in a vid!! amazing footy vids chris love it
all of the top 5s were proper bangers
7 got robbed ngl
Chris is clearly the best in his own video!
GET MINTER 🥺
fire
Joe and Caspar just made for Youtube
Grew up watching Smithy going round football towns and grounds as Frankie Fryer on Soccer Saturday. Now I’m watching him win football challenges on ChrisMD. What a career it’s been for him.
Only half way through but this might be my favourite video ever
i hate this guy because why are these sponsorship transitions so clean.
Class video
Damn Chris couldn’t get your pops a pair of boots 😂
Quadeca would just need 1 shot #Effortless
poor simon
Jcc robbed icl
How did you fail to get Simon again? Edit1: How Joe Weller's volley which went in off BOTH OF THE POSTS didnt make it in the top 10 is ridiculous. Edit2: I don't think I've seen a video of yours with that quality of editing. GG Connor!
Why does Simon appear at the end 😂😂
Stokey on a youtube video is mad lol
if we're being honest chris definitely had the best goal 🤣
i think Ethans goal should have been third at least
Elite content.
Exactly 😢where was our Lanky millionaire sex offender
Amazing video as always❤
if simon was there the video would have ended after his first 10 shots
Simon at the end😂😂😂😢
To be honest Chris´s goals were probably better but he cannot ein the money in his own video. That no.3 Goal was ridiculous....
Tubes is looking really healthy, so happy for him
I can’t lie I think chris shot was the best
What is the song at 19.40 ? Anyone
Romel had the crazies curves
INSANE VID
Such a high quality video! Loved it, especially the ending.
We need a top 10 saves on the second Channel. Some of those saves were outrageous
The last part of Miniminter showing was the funniest 😂
Chris is the best editor I do know
The post credits scene had me crying😭😭
Only watched bc Joe weller
Harry is a big traitor
Chris never disappoints, wow
there is no way mark goldbridge is 29
ChrisMD is YouTube, so much enjoyment and nostalgia in one video
Criminal this happened without Simon.
Jack Joseph let me kiss your small eyes
That Miniminter tease at the end 👀 Unreal video 🐐🔥🔥🔥
Bro really didn’t wanna risk bringing Simon or Tobi in for this 😂
Class seeing romell
💯🤍ARYANS HANDSOME👼🏼👨🏼🧑🏼👱🏼‍♂️👱🏼✨🔥♥️💪🏻
💯🤍ARYANS👼🏼👨🏼🧑🏼👱🏼‍♂️👱🏼✨🔥♥️💪🏻
Miniminter robbed 🤧
2:27 facts
keep up the great uploads an ideas
Alot of shite guests tbf
That caspar lee clip of him smiling😂😂😂
Theo’s and JCCs are surely the best technically but can’t argue with the winner
Theo just teleporting in from the hospital is brutal🤣
I forgot caspar and joe were people
WHERE IS MINTER?
11
Kon looks greater than ever now
Nice to see Weller in a video
Fan of Johns goal
What a kind of drama the colleges and universities are doing inside india actually in name of internal marks and all we have made draft of final exam to be conducted by 50-50% mcq theory based but not implemented on other hand the politicians in any party they are getting rich by wrong means & this is happening in open shameless form of democracy in India is prevailed while educated people are mostly unemployed
#8 was so filthy. Absolutely obliterated that ball.
Nice
Might be one of the best collabs I've ever seen
crrazyyy vidd
That number 1 was out of this World
Simon at the end was the funniest thing ever
danny arrons...
Miniminter in the end was work of art🤌🤌🤌
Free Palestine Free Palestine Free Palestine Free Palestine Free Palestine Free Palestine Free Palestine Free Palestine Free Palestine Free Palestine Free Palestine Free Palestine Free Palestine Free Palestine Free Palestine Free Palestine Free Palestine Free Palestine Free Palestine Free Palestine Free Palestine Free Palestine Free Palestine Free Palestine Free Palestine Free Palestine Free Palestine Free Palestine Free Palestine Free Palestine Free Palestine Free Palestine Free Palestine Free Palestine Free Palestine Free Palestine Free Palestine Free Palestine Free Palestine Free Palestine Free Palestine Free Palestine Free Palestine Free Palestine Free Palestine Free Palestine Free Palestine Free Palestine Free Palestine Free Palestine Free Palestine Free Palestine Free Palestine Free Palestine Free Palestine Free Palestine Free Palestine Free Palestine Free Palestine Free Palestine Free Palestine Free Palestine Free Palestine Free Palestine Free Palestine Free Palestine Free Palestine Free Palestine Free Palestine Free Palestine Free Palestine Free Palestine
honestly, editor carried
Potentially best intro to a video ever
2nd spot wasnt it
Jack and Cole are the set 8 kids coming into PE. Autistic as ever
chris lives on the pitch
Goated Video
24:44 IM DYING HERE 😂😂😂😂😂
Honord to be involved!
Simon at the end 😭
Chris should’ve won with his own strike at number 3, also number 6 underrated
Love seeing Weller
What a video 👑
Simon in the end LMAO!!😭
1st is definitely 1st.... without a doubt!
that Kon volley was insane 😳
I honestly thought joe thomlinson was Mark Zuckerberg
How on earth has StokeyyG2 ended up in a ChrisMD video
kon was robbed
banger after banger after banger, Chris carrying UK youtube yet again
This video is beyond legendary. True hall of fame UK vid. Thanks Chris, you’ve outdone yourself here (and that’s hard to do)
Could have nicked the top spot with my Rabona
Revenge for simon
that save off goldbridge .. unrealll
the simon ending though
Is that all?
9:56 they didn’t show the goal
chris having the multiverse of yt football in one vid is crazyyyy
arthur and george just make me laugh lol
Unbelievable quality, there are levels to this YouTube stuff and you just keep raising the bar
Simon at the end😂
What a video.. editor is insane - gg!
Con looks great and those calves 😅
Get joe in videos more I miss him 🥹
Less than 24hrs over a mil views
https://youtu.be/60Re0tT9MXc?si=8EPMA7fsEMyZgemT❤😮
I saw Simon 😳
How can Arthur always make fun of danny, that poor lad.
Jaackmaate the next scamacca
Should do an edit of the best saves too!
Such a sad ending when Simon shows up 🥲
Great effort put into this video 😎 For some reason youtubers think its okay to put minimal effort into there videos (Chunkz, Filly , Aj im talking to you !!!!)
Exactly!!! Where is simon????
love to see weller back in these videos
If only there was noah beck....
The intro alone is absolutely amazingly well done, and it somehow gets even better ONE OF YOUR BEST ❤
Football daily reigns supreme
Joe Sugg and Caspar Lee??? MY CHILDHOOD
Would of been abit awkward if behz and Joe turned up on the same day 😂
harry def had the best goal lol
Best intro ever that 😭🔥
Spectacular video.
I can’t be the only one that was most happy to see Joe back amongst it
wow
jack and joseph one had me crying
Still yet to see zerkaa on here
9:42 my fav moment
The bangarang skrillex song for the bass drop is top tier😂
simon popping up at the end was so funny
whats the song on theos clip
It was crazy seeing Casper lee and joe sugg in 2023
Didnt invite Simon very sad i cry 😢
The editing on this is world class
The editing on this video is the best I’ve seen on YouTube
Funny how Chris’ goal with his weak foot was probably the best
Credit to goal 6
What an intro 😂
Miniminter: Lost in Multiverse
The Caspar and Zoella edit. 😭🤣
You can tell the amount of time and planning that went into this vid🔥🔥Amazing video Chris!
The editing in thisss !
Hi Chris, I have a new video idea for you to do, best ginger footballer on YouTube, I think this would be very cool, love your content.
What a video 👏🏻👏🏻🙌🏻
Chris now has a cinematographer from marvel
why does the intro go so hard tho 😭
So does that mean Simon didn't get invited, invited but couldn't make it or saved him for another vid?
NEW KIDS JONGE
Joe and casper in here, im absolutely wetting it
Great edit 😂
What a video
Legend thank you for the invite my guy just ordered new hamstrings
Where minister
That's a bloody banger mate. ✌🏻
Callux is so bad
I’m surprised Bez goal didn’t make top10😕💔
What a vid…
amazing as ever, why everyone turns into comedians in these shoots I will never know 🤣
Didn't want Simon minter on as Chris didn't want to give him any money 😅🤣🤣
Honestly the most impressive part of this is that Chris has been able to get this many youtubers together
crazy video bro
Imo Simon and tobi would've done better
I’m literally 1 minute in and what an elite intro 🫡
Joe Thomlinson showing Exeter football at its best
smithy’s got that in his locker😤
Whatever ChrisMD is paying his editor, it's not enough
Shoutout to the person collecting balls for assisting chris's goal
I love how Theo came out the hospital
Joe Weller = 🐐
Tom Garratt edit is hilarious
Romell!!!!! Joe thomlinson!!!! Everyone!! Elite cast
If Billy Wingrove was here this would just be a video of his top 10 goals xD
Class.
That arsenal kit in the intro is awesome. Can I have it?
Joe and Casper are so elite
we all know that if Simon was in this video he would’ve won it
This is like the Endgame of YouTube
This might just be the greatest football video ever
Best goal imo was number 6
John somehow has a better shot than more of the other guys
should deffo do a video of the best saves during that as some of them saves looked unreal
its Theo Baker from the hospital show
That was the most deserved number 1 spot both of them goals where amazing and nice teamwork
20:13 tbh Ollie should've had that one...
This might be your best ever video
Perfect duo chemistry at the end. 🙌
Nobody talking abt Romal Henry's trivela
ArthurTV ?!
Goldbrige is 29? I thought he was 48 with kids or something
It won’t change anything😂
😂😂😂😂
The editor is out of this world!  Plus, That Miniminter Cameo at the end 🔥
that transition to the advertisement was flawless
Unbelievably top quality, credit to all the editor/s and people who took part 👏🏻 Brilliant video
chris has gotten so much better over the years , his fifa videos were class but the fact he’s adapted to an older viewing and done it so well
banger as perusual
Them keepers (bar Ollie) are outrageous
Can’t lie the transition at 3:32 is so smooth
Nice to see Joe Weller in a football video!
This is amazing, best video in a long time!!
Where is tobi and Simon
Surprised Simon ain't in it this time
Joe Weller's Thai women stats are dreadful hahahaha
ginger bloke has put on some timber corrrr
Goated video
Time to get Simon and Toni back in these videos 🤣
cheeky nabby2g on the chrismd channel
Remove the comma
This is an amazing video and the editing is incredible!!!!
What a lineup
great video again guys!
That intro was next level. At first I was like a bit cheesy but wow. That hit different
Simon at the end nice touch
Post Credit Scene👀
Wooooooooow ❤
Cracking video 👏🏼
casperrrrrr and joe sugggggggggggggg, it does bring back memories hahahahaa nice one chrismd
Greattttt video
WE NEED MR. MINTER!!!
This was my weekend every weekend before I became an adult
white boyband
Haha looks great fun
I watched the edit like 15 times
14:14 My brother used to be mates with Ally Law, I live in Southampton btw, he also does/or used to idk (my brother was in a few of his parkour videos) I saw him in Maccies the other day!
24:44 Was just about to ask where's Simon 😂
Simon at the end😥
That ally law shot was such a random unexpected callout especially in a chrisMD video
Joe Weller?
Nobody commenting on how ridiculous the saves were in this?
finally we can watch a new video from Chris🥳
What’s the song at 17:32
Simon, Tobi, Danny Arron’s, angry ginge anyone?
Avengers Assemble 😤
The Simon end is epic I wish he was in the video 24:48
Tubes is a legend 🙌
Yer was gona say if you had the the goat Simon on it 100% he would of won the money
The most ambitious cross over event in YouTube history
Justice for Garratt
It’s the football pundits they’re always so great love the work y’all put in!
As much as I'd like Chris to upload more, I'd rather wait a month for one amazing video over 2/3 average ones
The Editing on this video is absolutely AMAZING! Big up the editor
That was one of the best videos on YouTube absolutely quality and poor Simon
1:16 nah 😂😂😂😂
0:10 UK YOUTUBE ASSEMBLE!
George, Aurther and Chris are unmatched
chrismd only makes bangers
Chrismd+best editor on YouTube = this video
PIEFACE SCORED 😍😍😍
This video honestly made my day !!
Got to be a 6 mil nerf war
Nr 6 was a top 3 goal tbh. Great video btw 🙌🏻
class as always
Joe Weller, what a waste of human life
Thumbnail got me thinking its 2014
WHEREEE IS MINIMINTER???!!!!!?!?!??!
wheres the prize for the keeper, he did a amazing job
BEST CHRIS MD VIDEO
Ally Law has had a glow up 💀
All these guys but no Toby, many or simon
Seeing Joe Weller in a vid is kind of weird😅
Romell has 99 swaz
best edited footy vid on yt
Danny?
Honestly nearly teared up! All time classic reuniting the community
No Minter :(
ChrisMD is just legendary
This is the greatest video of all time
This video is a masterpiece. Very very entertaining!
00:10... Cringe 😬
Nah but why is Chris’s number 3 better than 1 and 2
Intro is insanneeeeee
we need a miniminter
romell is such a baller 🤣
Simon minter was in this video but the top 10 were all him
Miniminter at the end, hilarious 😂
The intro was one of the best I’ve seen
Romell can strike a ball
I wanted to see a volleyball from w2s so bad
Joe Weller...im gonna pass on this one and wait for the next vid
Content in future with Smithy, Romell, Toby, Tubes & Weller would be unreal!
wow just wow.
The top 2 ain't the top 2 let's be honest
Editor you were amazing. Chris that was a class class class video mate
class
Simon got the portal a bit later at the end
The curve in the #1 goal is actually so satisfying to watch
just love seeing waller back on the yt scene
How did Chris’s goal that was 3rd not win !!! 😳 😱
Ginge first touch is class  Yanited
ChrisMD is officially the GOAT of YouTube football. We need another recreation video though with Simon and Harry. Or how about another jersey vs guernsey?
all of these people and not the goat (simon)
Simon incoming
Editing in this is just 👌🏼
Best Chris md video ever or at least one of them thanks to the legend romell Henry all we needed was Jay swingler
What a video
We all know why Simon wasn't invited for the video
Boss idea and well put this. That last goal is satisfying as
Wow
I was wondering where simon was 🤔
Better CGI than Marvel themselves
Absolutely love to see weller back
Mind-blowing video
One of the best Chris MD videos ever
Absolutely love your videos and your edition 100% needs a raise but I need to know what’s happening with Simon, why was he in the line up and at the end but didn’t actually kick any goals! Big up Kon for making the top 10
That’s the best edited video I’ve ever seen. That smithy volley was zidane’s volley in the champions league flipped. Unbelievable
Great to see Ethan’s weight loss! He’s looking fantastic
the last second when simon arrived.....i lost it 🤣😂
This should become a regular thing, give the competition a name and get more people involved
Your shot at number 3 was worthy of a Zidane gif 👏🏼
what simon doing at the end
Miniminter ending😂😂
No way you out an advert in when I was waiting for Harry’s mum to get hit in the face 😭
Ah oh how I’ve missed classic weller.
Number 8 should’ve been higher
What a goal, out of all people Adam smith and Joe , sky sports presenters take the win , what a duo, what a moment.
No 3 was the best icl
Max Fosh is so much better than I was expecting!
Joe and Casper. Now that brings back memories.
The fact you got Tubes and Smithy on this 😂😂
Weller = entertainment
Possibly the best intro I've ever seen in a yt video
Can we all appreciate the amount of great saves by the goalie in this video
by far top3 chris md vids
Class
i don't compliment peoples editing much but your editor is top class.  The tiniest details are hilarious 🤣 (this isn't a joke to your height btw Chris)
WELLER IS BACK
introoooooooooooooooo xD
Amazing video
Need weller in more vids
this video would be done in 10 shots if simon was here lol
WHAT. A. VIDEO.
well...the end was sad :/ no minister bro
Unreal video
titi " he cooking hes cooking" ramsay "i dont think you can actually cook!?" what an edit!
Tobi simon danny and vik would have been perfect additions 😂
Return of Weller is legendary
Simon🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This is genuinley the best video ive seen in a very long time. Props to you chris 🤩
Class to see Weller back 🙌🏼
probably the best football video of all time
Theos was clearly the best there
wait tubes is claaaassss
this is heritage.
Needed Simon 😔
Stephen Tries???
Whats the other guys profit for this video? Why do they come to film
Has bhez lost more weight he looked fit as here
So happy to see Joe and Caspar in the vid, youtube legends
Cant believe I’ve know cam for a while now and it’s shocking how much he has grown he destined further 💪💪
I always wanna see Tobi and miniminter in these (they’d obviously take all 10 spots tho)
Chris’s half volley should have been number one
❤
Hopefully this a proper return to weller
I AM CRYING WITH LAUGHTER , yall need a fucked in the head dutch lower league goalie tho hit me up
The ending with miniminter is so sad 😭
12:47 is an insane save wtf
Seeing Casper, Joe And Weller here is incredible
Just as I was wondering where Simon was...
Nah the end was cold 😂
Romell and Toby needed more screen time 😢
the editing on this video is 🔥 🔥 🔥
Harry , Arthur tv and joe HOW CAN YOU DO THIS TO ME 😩😩
I think the best was the 8th best
Might’ve juts been the best intro EVER
One of the best videos on youtube
im actually impressed just frm the intro
That ending was personal 😂
Wait Chris's brother is funny now....;D
have to say watching this makes me realise, I'm not as bad at football as I think
Absolute class video mate
INSANE
Love seeing Weller be involved with the UK YT scene, gets way too much hate for someone who's the reason Jake Paul and Nate Diaz where in the ring together which I never thought would happen 4, 5 years ago lmao
Infinity war has nothing on this video
Why no kieren Brown?
Watching 5 dozens of men scuff a football puts a smile on my face
Yeah I don’t agree where was Minter
Of the best videos this year
Weller the goat
8:42 what is this technique :D is looks like grounded shot and suddenly goes up like bitcoin in 2021
N°6,4,3 were the best three IMO.
Another banger of a video but for me  Funniest Duo: Casper Lee & Joe. P.S: That ending was so deep, poor simon😓
What a great video u little hobbit
Another banger! ❤
Best intro on yt 💯
how expensive was simon? how could you not afford him
This is Chris’ editors Magnum Opus
Its nice to see joe happy again.
Literally skipped bez’s part coz I can’t stand the smug prick 💯
pie face plymouth are shite mate exeter city 🔛🔝
Feel Simon is going to be rising from the death in the next video <3
4th one is the best in my opinion
Stevie wonders ranked the top 10 oh dear
can we have an uncut of every shot?
Youtube video of the year!
😂
Need to do another video but with 10000 shots.
I was wondering why Cole didn't get a call up for the charity match, makes sense now...
This video is perfect.
One of your absolute best, the last shot was just the cherry on the cake. Mwah
chrismd never misses........
That Uno reserve edit sent me 😂😂
Chris should've won it
Great to see Weller feature in another YouTubers video again!
PART 2!!!!
Top video mate
chris you’ve reached new levels mate. what a team you’ve got 👏🏻
Where's the recreation of the James Rodriguez goal in the top 10 😢
Outro🤣🤣🤣🤣
Editing masterclass
Think that the best intro to a video I’ve ever seen
11:07 That was for the culture
Tom garrett needs to go steady hogging that amount of screen time
lol the sad minter at the end 🤣😂
Chris please don’t ever stop the footy content
Sorry but 4 was not better then 5
IF BREXIT WAS A FOOTBALL VIDEO: 😂😂
Get Simon Minter on it
696969 views .. lovely
Chris had the best goal
The ending gave goosebumps
hi
24:50 comon Simon
Best baller is tubes
What a masterpiece video this is.
great vid as always chris. loved how u brought all of these epic ballers on the vid(except for theo)
Imagine if miniminter was there
CHRIS HAD ON THE ENTIRE UK 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Can we all agree that Tom Garratt looks like Olivier Giroud
Chris MD to GOAT for football videos
The power in big Jons shots are ridiculous 😮😮😮
If Miniminter was here he will take the entire top ten
Ollie X Chris duo is BACK ❤
What a video 😮👌💯
That simon edit at end had me rolling 😂😂. W editor
I find this location of video so distracting. I lived there for 6 years so just keep looking at the background waiting for someone I know to walk past so I can send them the video 😂
6 is so slept on
What a great video!!! Ouch..the "post-credit scene"😂😂,  I was waiting for mm7 and a top 10 goals video without a TBJZL trivella!! Bring both of them back soon in a vid Chris!!
that post credit scene with simon...but where's tobi ??
Simon not there to give everybody else a chance.. also in my opinion your goal (no 3 position) was the best individually. understand back to back had to win it though.
What a video. Wow.
Cons transformation is actually crazy!!!
Where is Simon 😢
Where's simon😢
Huge W
Wow kons in shape
I saw harry and my brain thought it was a different kind of shots
I saw the goat at the end
Top tier list of guests here. Especially weller nice to see him active again
No Simon in this video! Our lanky millionaire deserves better 😢
The last 10 minutes is a cinematic masterpiece
Big ups to that keeper he made some mad saves
Editors rent was due 😂
Tbf I think John's goal shoulda been higher
Woe Jeller let's go
As if Joe Weller couldn’t get any more annoying
“that bastard” for me retired😂
Johnson wasbedt
6:08 Chris actually thought that the ball would hit him? hes like 4 foot tall
Theos is 3rd
How is max better than authertv 😂
poor simon
Number 6 got shafted
So many randoms but not simon minter, its a disgrace
Chris' goal was the best by far
Chris’s editor is another breed insane
Probably the funniest football video this year :D
honestly chris's 3rd and 4th best shots were better than 1 and 2
Your videos will always be goated 😂 poor Simon tho 😢😂
Not having simon and tobi in this video was criminal
Some of the saves in this were quality
Nice seeing Joe Weller again
He is VAN PERSIE
Iconic seing ollie in goal A true icon of the game
the goal before the opera add was definetly worthy of top 10
Editor is elite, also did Harry’s mom soo wrong, 5 times in 30 seconds haha
Finally a video after so long
What a video, deserves more views, the effort this would’ve taken
Simon said no to that one? Or just too much quality as he would have top 10 regardless?
Yo, where was Speed? XD
This might be the best video ever
Goldbridge intro  "Mark goldbridge, 29"😂 man's 44..😂
Hahaha "i need to buy pertol aswell" pretty funny that
min 10 chris does like a side bar review he should do that more often
That wolves top with the Doritos sponsor made my heart warm 🥲 I hope who was wearing that actually is a wolves fan 😂
Simon 😭
Simon and tobi
Still no zerkaa …
Miniminter at the end was an insane idea. Should've brought in tobi & Manny as well.
Romells curve broo 🔥
Dammmn  a miniminter cameo. Does that mean he’s gonna be in the sequel guys? 😂😂
Oli needs a boss transformation
ONE OF THE BEST VIDEO IV'E WATHED ON YOUTUBE!!! - I've watched far over 10000 videos - it was amazing keep it up ( the editing and execution and concept et. was excellent)  LOVE FROM SOUTH AFRICA ❤
Goldbridge is in his 20’s!!!! 🤯🤯
Big up weller
Sad Simon wasn’t in this tbh, cried the whole video and the end just made my mother cry  “I wish He was on that Amsterdam stag doo” is what she said
Song name around 1:00?
Simon MM7, Tobi, Manny, Filly, Chunkz, deffo would've made top 10 if they were here frrrr.  This video was crazy though, mad editing. Props to the editor.  Now the question is would Chris ever invite Noah Beck 😂
paradise for the final goal did it for me
Can i get the name of the song that played when chris scored number 3 please?
Simon wouldve won if he participated
tbh i just look for harry in the thumbnail and click on chris vids. He just elevates them. Unfortunately not this time 😥
Minter at outro bout to change the winner🎉
Wait a minute, so Theo's not crippled aftr the charity match???
I'm genuinely amazed that for a video this massive & with so many other content creators, Chris only managed to get 1.5 Sidemen involved.
Next vid Minter Tobi Manny Filly
Damn the Simon post credit scene
We miss Simon
BRO THAT INTRO???  10/10
Bro fully assembled the cast of YouTube
Minter is rich anyway so..
Behz strike was better tho
Where is Simon
Some bangers in here icl
What an edit
best vid i’ve seen from you
Simon the chosen one noooooooooooo
Quality😂👍
Romell is CRAZY with them shots also.. bum tap lol.      kons legs were WAM
What about miniminter
Where's Mr 'Time to smash it'?!
Poor simon
The best video I have watched in a long time 😍👑
MINIMINTER in the end was funny 😆
Simon at the end had me dead 💀 gotta know he woulda cleaned up there
No Stephen tries, pity.
You post a video once a month but when you do it’s a banger 🔥🔥🔥
MENTAL🔥🔥🔥
chris's ad segments are the best ive seen
It was so nice to see Caspar and Joe 😂❤
That was one of the best videos I’ve ever seen!?
Wtf is goin on in the thumbnail, the faces arent even recognisable 0:03
Big John's deserved 1st
hw manyy ads mate...its annoying af
This has to be your best video of all time
The ending 😂😂😂  Guess his portal didn’t work when it needed to work 😅  Also the editing! Damn 💯
One of the best videos of the year
Chris convinced me to download opera #sponsored
Ending….. “we’re in the end game now” 👀
w2s joe behz calxcal this is amazing fam
I think Danny’s caravan ran out of fuel 😂
Where Danny Aaron’s?😂
Chris, genuinely considering every single metric there is to consider is, the greatest YouTuber of all time.
Nah bro brought every legendary figure from our childhood
What a video  .what a hit the Winning shot is too btw 🔥🔥
the build up to harry's mum getting hit with the ball was top tier
im so happy that u invited legends like casper and joe. I've missed them so much
glad i stayed for the post-credit easter egg at the end
make a chess video chris
Mark Goldbridge is only 29🌚 I thought he was early 40's somthing 😅
can chris make another strip football challenge? preferably one that arthurTV will lose
One of the most important parts of an amazing goal, is an amazing keeper. Big ups to all these keepers who really stretched and dove, making the goals look that much better 🫡
Pay up theo😂As Chris one shot later scores a better weak foot goal😂
Only just seen the intro and I already know this is another typical ChrisMD banger <3
Wow a lot of effort went into this vid well done Chris !!!
Ngl this is the best of the best when it comes to uk youtube. This is genuinely historical, one for the ages. Thank you Chris for such content!
romell!!!❤❤❤, his curve is insane
Where was Simon?
The venom Jon strikes a ball with shouldn't be legal
mini miniminter cliff hanger????
Chris is a king for bringing in Casper and Joe 💪🏻👏🏻👏🏻
4k shots and still didn't beat Conor's volley from the nft video. That was goated.
Simon 😂
Everyone BUT Simon 😭😂
Isn’t Joe Weller on the juice ?
11:40 is the green shirt guy the same guy for the meme?
no way goldbridge id 29
Im a ChrisMD hater but the #3 goal was better than the #2. like come on!! bangerrrrr
Editing Masterclass on this one!!
My inner child couldn't stop smiling seeing Caspar and Joe in a video again <3
lol the simon edit at the end! why was simon not in it?
Leaving simon out is a sin and yet the most fair thing that couldve been done
Con's calves are W.H.A.M
Simon not in the vid is a crime
🔥
uk goat
Chris has some great editors
Simon at last😂😂😂
One of great YouTube videos
John in goal is actually unreal
Nice shots, awesome editing, great Video! Now i wanna genuinely see the top 10 saves 😂
You should do this anually
Best video i’ve seen in a long time!! Thank you for the memories chris❤️❤️
What is the ending suggesting 🤨🤔🧐
Rip Simon
can we talk about the hard work Kon has been putting in the gym!? He looks better and better!!!
The editor is definitely amongst the best. Damn, what a video 🎉
no simon and tobi
Finally the video with Joe Sugg is out. I was expecting something different tho
Should of done a fan vote for the winner
WHERE TF DID JOE SUGG AND CASPER LEE GO??? Welcome back to the YouTube game boys
Honoured to be involved!
the ending 😂😂😂
is that part 3 teased at the end just you and simon 4k shots?
I could’ve watched the whole video be with just jack and Cole
Best ChrisMD video ever 💯
When the goalie actually tries and leaps in the air like that, it makes the goals that much more satisfying
Here before 1M views banger videos
I rate this highly
And again on the YouTube channel of ChrisMD The goalkeeper gets paid to stand in the goal and look pretty and make no saves
I don't know most of them 😂😂
Speechless. I have so many words to say about this video I can’t even say a single one… speechless.
Honestly been a while since Watching Casper, was nice seeing him again
Simon and Tobi 😢
This video was just Perfect , i know that this is the greatest video everrr   Thank you Chris for making this masterpiece
Even his promotion of adds are so intriguing to watch 🤩 Hats off to the editors Chris for his presentation skills 🔥💥
Makes me realise how much I miss joe weller
That intro was the sickest thing I’ve ever seen
so no miniminter on a futbol video?-
8:17
NUMBER 6 ROBBED
I’m excited for Kon!!
#markgoldbridge
Tubes is lowkey cold 🥶
We need Danny!
I completely forgot Pie was on Deal or No Deal AND Big Brother LMAO
What happened to oli 😭
I dont fw the rating
Theo baker to start 🤣
Yeah that smithy goal is a joke
Where is simon
These are the best Chrismd videos
Can't wait to see the Pitch side on this
Chris just keeps on dropping bangers!!!
JOE THOMLINSON
we need more sugg, casper and weller!!!
Icl all were great but let’s be honest Chris won
Number 6 should actually be number 3
Naaa bro not Simon at the end 🤣🤣🤣
This indeed is the ‘endgame’ levels of cameos! 👏🏻🐐 Chris never disappoints, editors are insane!
that ending tho...
Holy christ😮... those last two shots that were back-to-back were absolute class 👏👏🤌 Always helps when you're wearing a United kit..😏
No Danny Aarons = dislike
thats the cringest intro of 2023
Awesome
So basically 70% of the YouTube world in one vid
incredible video mate...
Poor Simon 😭😭
bro grabbed the whole of uk youtube lmao
Can’t believe Kieran brown isn’t in this
OMGSimon
Unreal would love to see this with normal random people.
The end with Simon 🥲
Brilliant vid great editor just a great video 👊🏻❤️
That arsenal jersey looks 🔥
For the life of me, I wouldn't have guessed he would win. Fair play
Don’t usually comment on videos but this was something different. Top class. The range of guests brought nostalgia to older watchers, which was a great touch.  Bringing newer creators and people who wouldn’t usually be on a football YouTube video made it even better. Hats off chrismd
George and Arthur, are just joe Sugg and Casper Lee reincarnated
.
Everything about the last 3 minutes of this video is CRAZYYY AMAZING
Chris's screamer with ethans grim celebration should've won that 😂
Chris content got better but he barely upload smh 🤦‍♂️ keep up the work but dang I don’t wanna wait for 1-2 months for content
simon noooooo
Bro that thumbnail is terrible
ChrisMD video never fails to deliver. Worth the wait every time🙌
AMAZING EPISODE CHRIS & THE TEAM 👏👏👏👏💯💯👍
simon 😢
What a video Chris, dont take it to heart on how it performs with all the features instead pat yourself on the back for putting this masterclass together 👏
Ollie looking like Kevin de burger
Is it just me or this video really loud? I can barely get my volume up
Holy SH*T at Kon! Mate that is a glow up on par with Behzinga! That being said he's about as useful in a football video as ChrisMD would be in a basketball video. Nice try though !
The ending with Simon through the portal had me LMAO. Should have added Tobi and Manny to it as well. Great video!
that endgame portal entrance is cold btw. credit to the editors for that one.
What a roster
Why is this not an hour long video 😭
ngl, edits are implacable.
Max Fosher has such a Tory kicking style 😂
I'm not even into football that much but I love these videos
absolutely incredible video, content and production 10/10
What a video so many different YouTubers
Should’ve had minter here he would have half the top goals🤣
We need miniminter!
btw harry's croatia dress is one of the sickest football jerseys I've ever seen
Holy crap this video is an all timer, Hes rasing the bar, He makes football so interesting
Holy crap this video is an all timer, Hes rasing the bar, He makes football so interesting
WHAT. A. VIDEO
What was the song for number 8 and 7? Sounds amazing but can't find it anywhere, think I've found the song but not the remix.
number 3 was better than 2
Vid of the month?
John and acc r better than Theo
Ffs why is BTEC Arthur and Stoke guy getting screen time?😭😭
Pieface’s weight loss is amazing
weller made my day ❤ lovely throwback
Vid of the year 100%
Last two goals was insane!!
Woulda been jokes having weller and behz together 😂
Bro brought the whole of uk YouTube together for this
Was gonna watch this, till I saw Joe Weller was is it.
That was honestly one of the best videos I’ve ever seen. Kinda felt like a video he would make at the end, he brought everyone and it almost brought a tear to my eye
The build up and pay-off to the harry's mom headshot was cinema
Honestly didn’t think Joe Welles was still around and now I remember why nobody’s heard from him for ages.
Chris’ content is consistently great.
The curvature on Smithy’s goal is fascinating.
Let’s be honest Chris won but he needed some else to win it😂
chris'  was easily the best
He need someone like Simon in this type of video
Goosebumps
ay that intro really was elite though 😂
unreal editing! brilliant idea and some pure class from some people!
We miss simon
Loved the post credits
still reckon Danny Aarons woulda boxed off no.1 easy
How can Chris use all this music?!?!?!
Love your football videos
Where was Danny Aaron’s??😢
The ranking of the goals was poor honestly jaja
Editor is fantastic. Can tell this has taken months to make 👏🏻👏🏻
Simon 😭😭
I love that we have Joe Weller back in the football videos! Been way too long!
How could you possibly top this?!
The list is fucked
Would be great if chris put a video with all the shots well edited without breaks in between the shots.
Out of absolutely everyone that could’ve won, I am so glad it was Smithy
End game vibes, sheeeshh, kudos to Chris' editor, that's fire
Chris is my favorite of all time.🫡 He deserves everything he's got 💯🔥
Legend says, ChrisMD can still hear Miniminter's cries at night
Wow a video where Chris MD didn't rank himself first place becasue for some odd reason he's the one who ranks everyone's goals?
Another Chris md classic
Danny Aaron’s would have won icl
Amazing
Need a directors cut
JCC got robbed at number 6 but the duo much deserved it 🔥
how much money did you have to pay people to make this video for you??? i bet you could fund the government with that money
class
Bro the end with Simon Broke my heart 😢
Can I just say I’m 40 seconds in and that intro was incredible
Kon in top 10 is almost more impressive than all the other goals
I want to see a proper video like this with Tom garratt. What a one shot appearance 🤣
Big John is unbelievable
BLOODY HIT IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Smart to leave Simon out of it or he's taking 1-10 for himself, seeing a video with Weller and Chris together, Sugg, Caspar, and the entire UK tiktok scene is incredible though
Bro this intro
Thats one of the best football videos you will ever see. The people, the goals and lets not forget the immaculate editing. Editor , take a bow son.
Chris is the goat of IRL football content.
this is an iconic day for UK youtube and i couldn’t be more here for it
If this ain't youtube football 'eritage
chris' goal at number 3 was absolutely insane
Kon looks awesome after his weight loss. Very impressive
Chris putting his own bad foot goal above Theo’s is outrageous
Come for Chris MD, stay for Romell Henry
Loved that we got a variation in this, Weller, Casper, Jaack, Kon, Garret, class video 👏👏👏
Ngl winners weren’t the winners
nah Chris robbed theo of the #4 spot
Epic video
Looked kinda awkward between Joe and Chris lol
One of the best videos I’ve seen on YouTube in a while
This is easily best combination of youtubers in the history of youtube.
Thanks for bringing Romell in, I've missed him
JOE WELLER NO FUCKEN WAY
What a Video Son. Loved the intro.
9:35
World class. Viva Joe Thomlinson!
ok but like some of those saves where incredible
Top 2 wernt that impressive John's and jjc should be higher
Ethan’s goal deserved 10th over Chris’s icl
Could ChrisMD be back up there as a British YouTuber Balon D’or shout
Don’t mind me but with this many subs and still needs to involve an ad is pathetic, hopefully you pay your editing slaves with that money😉😂🤣
There has got to be a top 10 for the worst
MINIMINTERRR! that last part needs a continuation, surely!
terrible title
I love the simon edit at the end😂😂 also I know chris couldn't win but his second goal with behz was the best goal of the video hands down
Love how Simon is not forgotten😅
No minter and jizzle is criminal
Can’t wait for a part 2
Best video of 2023
Crazy how Joe and Caspar didn't miss a beat and were as funny as ever.
WELLERRRRR!!!!
Wicked video 🫡
finally a post
Jack and Cole’s part is actually hilarious
A bit of topic, but doesnt joe weller look like Jamie Tartt from Ted Lasso or is it just me?
THE ENDDDD SIMONNNNN
The editing on this 😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨
that ending
Simon (Miniminter) at the end had me lmao why was he not in the video that was really funny though.
Think of the top 10 that JCC was the best goal
Simon at the end lmfao
Chris’s off foot goal was the best, but I get he can’t put himself number one
Tom Garratt did only get 1 shot 😂
Rat
That weak foot trivela volley was crazy
ahh no miniminter 😢
only chris could have me watching a football vid
Weller being in this video is just great to see
Where is miniminter when he's needed
best intro everrr seen
Theo is back already? did he break a toe nail lol
Romel needs to appear more
This was unreal, glad to see Joe Weller making an appearance and Smithy smashed it for number 1
icl chris's goal was the best
It's impossible not to smile while watching these videos. At the end of the day, it's just mates having fun and a few laughs while playing football - how pure and wonderful is that!?
Baby Elvis great bloke
Why is stokey nonce in this
Isn't Theo's fragility a little bit low?
What a editor
dude you're the mr. beast of football lol. Wild to see this happening to a friend
Legend🎉🎉
Desperately need a part 2 of this with Simon and Toby, F2, Filly and chunks, Danny Aarons and Angry ginge, Bateson and True Gordie and a few other pairings
I hope we can see more of Joe and smithy, FD to the top!!!
I mean that intro has to be top 5
Caspar and joe… someone wake me up.. I’m dreaming
that intro was nuts
thomas partey last season:
JCC was robbed
Chris’ razor needs a demotion.
What a video …
number 8 should be higher imo, great vid
Having the keepers actuslly trying to save shots made it even better
this is seriously incredible,, so awesome to see everyone in this :)))
those top 2 are absolutely ridiculous 👏🏼
Tubes got a bit you know!
romells movement he gets on the ball is mental
THE SIMON ENDING HAD ME DYING 😂😂😂
Props for No limit.
JOE WELLER BABY
tom garrett needed more screen time for sure
Goldbridge made this very disappointing
JCC got robbed.
that opera transition was fire. Chris's videos are always fun to watch for the content, but also to see the production value grow over the years has been just as fun. Great video!
No Danny
Chris knew Simon or Tobi (TBZL) would get all the money
Jack joseph and cole anderson😂
10/10
That ending with simon is so sad, makes you wonder if he would have scored some bangers
Unreal video 🙌
seeing Caspar and Joe here makes me happy
Why does the shots amount go ape and just go up 50 after one shot.
weller the goat bring him back for more vids
Never really watched much of your content but if its gonna be like this I'll stick around!
Miniminter would have taken it
Nice to see Joe Weller again
nah that #1 spot well desrved!!!!!!
“I’m currently familiar with MD” he says in an upper class accent.
“I’m falling for so long”😂
For me it's callux and JCC then chris md
Roberto Carlos used to skip school to watch Romell Henry play
The different skill sets for each person in their introduction is such a nice detail!!
Editing top notch as always but that intro is defo the best one yet
I was certain that was Harry Hesketh hahahahahaha
Seeing Joe and Caspar in a youtube video together feels so weird. Nostalgia to its finest
Was about to comment about the 1 person missing but tbf the edit at the end made up for it
chris looks even shorter next to sharky and john
the build up of a song when a goal is about to be scored always hits different!
1. Best Video in YouTube Football in a VERY Long Time  2. Wheres Simon Minter
Ending was perfect 😂
Reminds me of 2016 YouTube and I love it
We want Danny
Really enjoyed this vid
I really really wanna touch a pitch with the rubber in it like this! I NEED TO KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE
No Ginge or Simon is criminal
jack joseph and cole anderson james are iconic
El Nabber Stokeyy 😭👋🏼
i havent seen casper lee in so long. so many familiar faces in one place, banger
Simon at the end 😢😂. Was waiting for him to come out in the intro
jack and cole are hilarious. THE GOATS
Unbelievable Marvels entrances...the Simon cameo at the end though? Ice. Cold.
No 1 was a robbery😂
how are there so many different youtubers
The goat has made another banger
Unreal.
Give that editor a raise 👏🏼👏🏼
I would have loved it if Chris just made all of his goals top 10 as a joke. Could have definitely seen him doing thst
John shot an absolute rocket my lord
Best YouTube video I’ve seen in ages
We all know Simon wouldve been unfair tbh
that switch to the ad was cold
Well done Chris!! Well done 🫡
CHRIS' DAD IS BACK?? I THOUGHT HE DIED IN ENDGAME
Brighton start doing better then Chelsea so Joe Weller changes team. What a glory hunter
Chris was deffo tho best still haha
The most ambitious crossover since end game
Crying at that ending 😂😂😂
Please get Ollie a PT and a dietician. My boy needs to get jacked in 2024.
do it with pros
Up next: Recreating Youtube’s Top 10 goals with Miniminter
Fair play to baby elvis tho what a fuckimg strike
I've come to expect bangers from Chris but this is something else, great vid
Chris's content is always the best.
i thought at the begining  minter and zerka would show up at the final shots to be apart of it
i honestly did not expect caspar and joe
This intro was a masterpiece
great video as always
8:58 Tom with the plug 😂😂
JCC robbed or Chris goal
Kon has big guy calves. Guys who used to be overweight who then get in shape develop those 😂
Boys will be boys
fly me out chris and i will pay for my return flight with that prize money guaranteed.
Does callux try to kick the ball as weak as possible or what
Joe Thomlinson for the win
That intro was insane
That ending edit was genuinely top tier
Jeezz casper and Joe bring back memories I used to watch them all the time 😂💚
Quality
270,287 views in 3 hours Well done Mr MD
we need weller back for a longer vid
No Simon Miniminter is an absolute crime
Where is Kieran Brown?
seeing joe weller >>
Incredible opening sequence and goosebumps at the top 2 hahahaha great video once again
This is an absolutely incredible video, loved it mate!
Weller was class😂😂
5:56 “I’m falling for so long”🤣🤣🤣🤣
who invited stokeyygeorge😭😭😭
Smithy😨🚀🚀🚀
Have to get those french lads off tiktok in a vid
the goal joe and adam scored gave me goosebumps
I was legit constantly thinking “WHERE IS SIMON!?!??”
Number 6 deserved 1st place
The fact that miniminter is not in this video is crazy
Tubes an absolute baller 🔥
This is an all-timer
#arthurshankskids
The goalkeepers In this video were world class 😂😂
i didnt even think of miniminter until i saw the ending.
This isn't just YouTube football heritage, it's even TV football heritage. Class.
Criminal Simon wasn’t there
A lot to take from this video but imma say kons fucjing calves are insane
Loved seeing Weller in this video!
8:38 how can u not put the James Rodriguez 2014 goal sound over it?
Can’t wait for miniminters reaction vid😂
perfect start perfect vid perfect vib perfect ending, It was perfect everything to the last piece was just PERFECT fire fire fire vid🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Applied alert ? For Lord of the rings
simon at the end made me laugh lmao
Big up Kon in the top 10 with his banger⚽️
clickbait tutorial 100% working 2023
No Minter 😞
Kon looks incredible wtf
Chris you should give italianbach a feature in a vid, he a funny fella
insane video 🔥
Cole and Jack made my winky hard with those fire shots
Theo straight from the ambulance
number 6 is a banger
poor simon
Hi
need more of these🤣
No mini, no tobi, no manny
Arthur and George Clarke are the best duo
Number 3 by Chris is utter filth. Has to be the best goal by far
WHAT A VIDEO. GREATNESS!
Simon at the end 🧍‍♂️
Nah I think Kon wins this tbh
Video starts at 19:34
The miniminter feature at the end lol. Amazing video.
Best football video you have ever done
Love to see Father Dixon back in business.
enough about the video, can we just appreciate Kon's progress?? Bros an absolute unit!!!
cole and jack are elite😂
My favorite video on the Chrismd channel so far 100%
Please bring Weller back again🐐
The ending was amazing!! I was asking where Simon was?!?
We need more Weller
cold edit
joe weller actually being brought back into british youtube 😍😍😍😍😍
Its crazy to think chris filmed so close to me
Well done on another great video Christopher Medical Department
leaving simon out knowing hes going to win 👀
Why no Miniminter? No Tobi? No Manny???
The first 2 goals back to back were crazy, well deserved
How does chris never fail to disappoint
I don’t remember Ollie being that much taller than Chris 😂
Where is Kieran brown?
Why Miniminter and Tobi weren't part of this?
Simon at the end 😂 his portal opened too late lol.
Chris does a vid with 40 youtubers and Zerkaa still dodges it
No simon🥲
More joe weller!
Need Danny Aaron’s
24:43 I’m so glad this was in the video 😂 because I was thinking the whole time how weird it is that Simon isn’t in this when him and Chris do this together the most😂it’s the same with Tobi but he didn’t get his special camio😢   Also still waiting for Josh/Zerkaa to feature in a video this year like he promised.
Banger
Simon's too busy huh
Youtube was made for ChrisMD
Minister not being in this video is criminal
Why does ChrisMD never fail to disappoint he makes me love football too much.
pure joy, whole video
Chris never dissapoints. Legend😅
nice vid, but wheres danny
what an incredible video, editing and references were on point!!
Theo's goal was so clean
Chris really summoned the whole UK Footballverse just for this video
I never thought Steve would return to a video. What a guy
All these people and he still couldnt get simon minter to show up
Goldbridge not wearing pink boots is the only disappointment in this video
That editing is goated😮❤😂
Theo's ambulance entrance Is crazy 😅
Random thought but remember when Chris wouldn’t let people swear in his videos 😂
Oh there’s no way I’ve just seen THE WELLMEISTER🐐
phil mickleson calves on kon
there is something missing and it's mister caravan himself anny darons
So glad smithy won
Number 6 And Number 4 Were The Best
It’s not even a question anymore is it…  🐐
SIMON AT THE END NOOOOOO
Where was the goat mm7? :(
Jack and Cole had me weazing🤣🤣🤣
Simon at the end 😢😢
Simon at the end 😂 great video
did not expect stokey, funny tho
No Stephie, no watchie
Simon at the end😂😂
The curve on that winning goal is actually mental
My mate got a picture with pie face at an argyle game 😂
One of the best videos i've watched in a while. You're smashing it like always Chris 👍
Really didn't expect a  Brommapojkarna shirt Power and Precision is wearing in the video lol
Jack and Cole were definitely the best combo
it's amazing to see what sunday league footballers can do
Jack taking 10 steps to fall is amazing
Lets be honest number 3 was the best goal
No anny darons no fun
People who thought number 3 (ChrisMD’s) was the best but if he could win it then that’s my number 1 👇
One direction didn’t win the X factor. I’ll take my place. Loved being a part of this! 😂
I almost thought this would be shots as in alcohol shots.. 😂
The editor is doing work!!!!🎉
ive missed joe being ion videos
Did you pay Simon £4k to not turn up?
Theo saying that no one will score a better weak foot goal, immediately followed by Chris scoring a better weak foot goal is priceless
No Tobi and Manny is criminal
Weller and Harry with the 98 Croatia kit. Love it. Ajmooooo 🇭🇷🇭🇷🇭🇷🇭🇷
this is hands down the biggest collaborations of the year!
One of the best of the year SHUN
This edit is insane 🤌🏼
@18:36 insane shot
I miss joe weller and caspar in youtube videos
As soon as I saw Harry's Mom I knew where the w2s clip was going and I was still laughing the whole time 😂
Hands the down best intro I’ve ever seen 😂😂😂
That 3rd goal was filth
try uploading in 4K next time please its painful to watch this grainy video
Honestly that's the video of the decade, couldn't stop smiling...
another video another W
2023's best video. ON YOUTUBE
Use my comment as a GIVE EDITOR A BONUS BUTTON
I have brought... THE BRITISH EMPIRE
I think a lot of people missed the word play in the intro. Something to MARVEL at, DOCTOR’s orders. Then brings in the Doctor Strange “avengers assemble” style portals. Very clever and made my inner nerd smile. Dope vid, through and through.
One of the best videos on YouTube
Always look forward to your vids brother. But not having Simon or Tobi in this is a travesty
this is the perfect video for what it is, the connections and representing well known people, editing, pacing of the video, literally everything what a banger
From getting hunted by police to being mint at football wow 😂😂
Mark is 29??  He looks 40
I've missed Weller in the scene
Personally think John's goal was the best.
Great vid, but I tell ya what, some of those saves by the goalies were absolutely unbelievable!!!  Why not do a video for the goalies, best save wins £xxx ???
one of the greatest videos on youtube
big johns number 8 was much better than Theo's number 5 :S so much easier to hit a precise flick up volley than a rolling ball like John did!
Couldn't be happier with the winners ❤
Goldbridge and Pieface bit is funny af
I hope the camera girl got hazard pay due to Theo !
Simon & Tobi must of been really really busy😂
I would’ve watched all 4000 shots😅
Chris only got broke up with because of his obsession with Simon
Joe weller youtube gold btw
No miniminter is sad
Chris mds videos always have been some of the greatest funniest masterclass editing ever and it always just adds to the fact the boys are funny oul legends fair play
Might the best youtube video this year
Probably the best collaboration ever.
Insane Vid
Your editor deserves fired and promoted at the same time. I don’t know if that entrance was cringe or legendary 😂
absolute banger as always, only Chris can bring Caspar out of retirement
8 should've been higher than 7... 7 was just okay. But the winners deserved it.
Would've loved to see angry ginge
Simon at the end had me rolling 😂
Insane lineup
Kons Kalves
is it just me or has ollie gotten hella bigger
19:20 Top 10
Bravo Chris, this was one of the most entertaining YT videos I’ve watched in awhile.
Why the number so spesific😕
Ollie is looking buff
Chris is so clearr rn.
Shout out to the keepers, reckon you’ve got a top 10 saves list in there also
This video is Goated
Amazing seeing all these youtube legends in one video
Gotta get Geowizard on one of these collabs undercover baller!!
Superb! The editing is just on a different level
Bro Im crying😢 I felt like I just watched one of the best movies on earth...thank you Chris MD for producing an absolute banger of a video that will forever be remembered
Chris being half of the top 10 😂
Legendary Video
The inbetweener clips are legendary
Elite intro/trailer. Top tier MD
Simon at the end lmaooo... chris knew he couldn't include him or he would have had half of the top ten shots
I celebrated when I seen Joe, grew up watching these 3 and the sidemen
you need to give simon, toby and manny 100 shots to try and beat the best goal
THATS WHY HES THE GOAT
seeing joe sugg and caspar lee together again puts a nostalgic smile on my face
Tf is StokeyG2 doing in a chrisMD video 😂😂😂
Personally I think number four was the best
the last 2 are mental
the influence chris has now is nuts. just deep the amount of total subs in this vid
Chris being way too humble, his third goal was easily the best
Joe Weller just gets YouTube doesn't he, in the brief cameo here his mannerisms and everything are just pure entertainment, miss him being in the scene so so much.
No Minter 0_0
Yes a Chris md video
Chris is in his prime :o
This must be one of the greatest collaborations in YouTube football history
I feel like Chris should have won that… just saying
What a belting video. Big machinima top 10 killcams of the week vibe
okay chris has to be the best youtube editor
The tension built by the meme of Harry's mum 😂
The recent vids have been like movies, brilliant
No miniminter, Danny Aaron's, Tobi, Manny, billy wingrove and I'm sure many other relevant UK YouTubers...but the most irrelevant washed up UK YouTuber on the scene Joe Weller makes the cut? Huhhh
Johns number 8 goal is criminally low
Still no zerkaa
Seeing so many UK YouTube icons in one video is amazing and having Ollie in goal gave me a huge wave of nostalgia!
Absolute banger Chris🔥
One of the most legendary football videos ever !!
Unreal video
This intro is smtg else
Elite editing and transitions throughout the video
The work that goes into these videos is insane.
that guy in the back should win it for wearing a wolves kit 🐺🧡🖤🟠⚫️🔸◼️
Let the CCU BEGIN (Chrismd Cinematic Universe)
Give ChrisMD's editor a raise!
that intro deserve a like alone. cold.
I need some sun cream , not that much sun cream its in me eye😂😂
This was so OG YT all star I half expected to see Fred and The Annoying Orange take some shots! Class video and deserved 1&2!
Smithy is a class act. Get Quadeca on next time after his most recent Music video 🔥
Probably my favorite Chris video ever.
this is what football youtube needed best video since that sidemen era
"It's in me eyes" 😂😂😂
Anyone know the song at 17:30?
This is just Chris highlight real vid tbh
💣
No Miniminter, no Danny Aarons, no Tobie, no Manny, no bueno.
no me thinking Chris's dad was Simon 😅
If this weren't chris video he would of won
The tek on smithys finish🤯
WHY WASN'T SIMON THERE!?!?
Been watching YouTube for 15 years now, this has to be one of my all time favourite videos, Chris we salute you 🙏🏻
Romell Henry had the craziest curl on his shots
I never expected Joe sugg to be in a Chris md video 🤣
video feels like a homage to football youtube. class
The ending. Legendary. GOATed video already
Mate that intro was actually unreal 🤣🤣🤣🤣
The ending has me in stitches the whole way through I was like this is missing a Simon
great editing/storytelling
Get stokey George out of here.
Which ChrisMD video rivals this as his best OF ALL TIME!?
"not that much sun cream, its in me eyes"💀
That ending was perfect
WHERE IS GINGE FXCK OFFF
JCC ROBBED
24:50 it’s time for the return Simon you know just as well as we do
Ok
Number 3 was the best goal don’t care
Everyone but the goat Simon  lmao
wanna see best saveves in either the 2nd channeel or clips
This was a great video. I've never played football because of my Ingrown Toenail. But i enjoy football thro your videos. And what a great ending 😂.
2:42 Shout out to the editor. I know he's checking the comments ❤
Let’s go cole
simon cameo at the end was a nice touch
I love how half the goals in the top 10 are just Chris 😂
Simon at the end actually makes me so sad 😭😭
Simon at the end is great … videos are actually a movie, unreal chris
Hello
4000 shots, Chris is really turning into an alcoholic.
Caspar and Joe featuring was comedy gold and great nostalgia, loved it
That was a perfect video lol. The ending
freezy looking kinda wham
The editing is superb throughout
Banger vid
Chris doesn’t post often but the videos are always amazing ❤
Max Fosh is lowkey an absolute baller!
Adam smith - HE DOES LOVE PLAYING AWAY
Simon minter not being in this is criminal
John's at 7 is harsh, absolute rocket
Still think yours was the best! Number 3! 😂 ( doesn’t change anything)
How has Joe Weller not changed in nearly 7 years
Greatest Intro of all time
James and Cole, Joe and Smithy, Joe and Casper  and Romell were the best guests out of the Avengers lineup
We need more of Jack and Cole they were too funny 😂
Great vid. Some of those saves are wild!
Why is Simon not in this video 😭
8:52 did him dirty with the arm wrestling😭
Ollie looks like he has done a lot of takeaway food lately pulling in the pounds that ginger lad is
What a vid, pure quality 😂
Bro wanted to win and became Zinedine zidane
Great to see Weller back on a video
Simon at the end! 🔥
Video of the year…
Seeing joe in this is so wholesome, warms my heart 🤍🥹
24:11 deserving winners tbh, the fact that is back to back is unreal
NAAAAHHHHH 5:52, JACK FALLING HAS ME IN STITCHES😂😂😂😂😂
I think number 5 was the best tbh or Chris number 3 of the post
Big ups the editors
Where’s Simon minter bro❤
This was such a fun watch. Easily one of the best videos of the year hands down
Tom being shown for only one shot 😭😭
Last one was legendary, this one is going to be historical 😂
CASPERRRRRR
Great video Chris
The set up for the football in Harry's mums face was brilliant. We all knew it's coming. We just didn't know when.
Where simon and danny
Props to kon for getting in shape
Here we go again 😂 last one was legendary
Harry in anny vid, i'm there.
That ending was brilliant 😂
what an incredible video as always, love seeing Joe Weller back in other peoples videos too😍😂
Why do football goalies jus watch the shot and admire it as it goes in off the boot. I’m Canadian and play hockey, I play goalie, I am taught to never ever give a shot up! Why they jus stare at it like 👀 n watch it fly past you 20+ yards out . Love the video btw . The hobbit should upload more .
Now we wait for another 8 months for another banger like this ;(((
The sponsorship transitions are just getting better
Damn you literally got everyone, apart from Simon RIP 😢
Anyone remember the days when Chris didn’t swear
How far down hill did you have to go get stokey and Buvey
SORRY BUT 8 need to be higher
Zidane Prime @no1
Also Chris, your goals - still very very impressive to me, only one to get 3 goals in top 10 🥵🤭
Absolutely more Joe and Casper lmaoooooo
WHY IS GEORGE THERE LMAOO
unbelievable video
Only at the start but seeing Romell from tgf has already got me gassed
its nice that Theo payed for this prize
7:31 also..... Not happy with Kon rn. 🙃 Hope you weren't hurt too bad Chris cry.. 🥺
nr 5 defo should of been top 3
Bro best intro ever
Chris MD is the GOAT of Football Content. Case closed ❤.
Fantastic and hilarious vid! And your use of music really elevates it! Well done!
Sugg and Caspar HAVE to be back!!
where is simon
Weller😍
Jack and Cole are so funny together need them in more football vids Chris
How has Chris' trivela weak foot volley not win?! Unreal to only be at #4.
so chris has upgraded from alcohol to cocaine
this video made my week tbh
Joe weller saying thank you for having me is class 😊👍🏻
Simon 💀
No yours was the best one
Never would I think Zoella would appear in 2023 ChrisMD video, but here we are
What an intro 😭👏🏾👏🏾
This video was absolutely everything, from every aspect. Sidemen, Weller, Joe & Casper, Romell, Soccer AM etc. Only people truly missing were the rest of SDMN, Jay Swingler, Danny Aarons and Angry Ginge
WHERES THE REAL MM7 HE WOULDVE GOT THE BEST GOAL FOR SURE
Chris uploading on my birthday is an amazing gift!
YESSSS
theo should be paul breach for halloween
The start of the video I legit thought... there's no way he's actually got all those people... Then he had hahahaha. What on earth.
no miniminter smh my head
Thanks for having me part of this legendary video❤
Editors desperately need a raise
The editing has really stepped up, and not just the into, brings a professional vibe to the videos 👌
Unbelievable video!
NUMBER 6 IS HEAVILY UNDERRATED
Finally Romell in football 😭
One of the best youtube collabs ever
Need a top 10 saves thanks
Szoboszlai
UK YouTube heritage
Damn, Joe Weller, Joe Sugg, Casper Lee, Konstantin, Buvey, George Stokeyy, JCC, Cole Anderson-James, Tom Garrett, Smithy and Joe, Mark Goldbridge, Pieface, Tubes, P and P, and Chris' Dad all got on a ChrisMd video this year before Zerkaa did
How have you managed to get people from every end of the Social media spectrum🤯🤯🤯🤯
The multiverse is real!
I never ever comment, but wow I had to say this video is absolutely incredible. Bravo, just well done bro
How is Simon Mr. Minter not involved but is at the end of the video?
Too many ads!!!!!
What a video
No Danny 😢
Ur number 3 post and in was the best
GET JOE THOMLINSON IN MORE VIDS
All these features but Little Dixon still couldnt bag a Tobjizzle appearance
21:56 Chris celebrating like that woman in the South Korean national team lol
simon at the end lmaooooo
Ngl Chris should have won but of course he can’t win his own money
that might be the best intro on youtube
If Chris could win this, he definitely would. Kinda hope Simon or someone nabs this idea so that he can lol
The post credit scene was cold 🥶
Buvey was embarrassing
gayest intro of all time ?
The fact Simon has his own pitch and couldn't make time to take 100 shots with Chris says it all. Bellend
Romells a baller
no simon minter?
That was well deserved 🔥
Biggest collab in YT history
amazing video cris i love your content but i think your #3 goal was number 1
An absolute honour being involved in a Chris MD Vid. Top day ! Loved it!  Smithy 👍
Chris' editor needs a raise. Seriously.
ChridMD, take a bow son.
So happy to see Joe back in the uk mix! Well we needs to be off the blacklist, the amount of YouTubers big or small who’ve copied him recently ( past 3 years) is criminal! Bring back Joe!
Unreal video from start to finish
Simon not being in this video is a crime
Who’s the prick in the brighton shirt ??? He added nothing
Seeing a Chris video makes my Friday night ten times better
for me the top 8. goal was the winner one
The BEST ChrisMD video ever!
Absolutely amazing video 🙌
Why is he not drunk ☹️
Sat down enjoying it till 9:00 mins then skipped because Tom Garrett ruins everything
The sad Simon ending had me crying a Little 😢
Honestly chris’ goal at #3 was by far the best
he just doesn't miss
I miss alcohol
Can we just appreciate the editing 😮
Haven't seen casper lee and Joe sug in ages
literally 12 minutes in and ive watched 16 unskippable adds i give up
How is that trivela weak foot volley from chris not higher on the list
21:54 For me this is one's the best tying with  22:24 this one for sure!!
You should have made john thanos for the intro
Gold bridge on a Chrismd vid. My life is complete
Where was Simon,Tobi,JJ??
Top 3 should be top 1 it was absolute banger
probably one of the best football video on youtube. Between the different youtubers and all of these amazing goals.
Class video🎉❤
Them two goals to win the money, unbelievable finishes, back to back, couldn’t write it better!
4:52 you are paying way too much mate, move
All bs aside crismds top 3 was the best goal
Another video smashed by chris! The ending tho!!
Love the vintage kits 🔥
6 was better than 5 and 4  and. I think it was the 2nd or 1st
Chris where's Kieran Brown?
Nah genuinely one of the best videos of the year, UK wide not just Chris
sorry but where is simon???
Anyone notice how Chris sounds like he's struggling to squeeze out a fat turd when he does his voiceovers?? Sounds so constipated lmao
What a banger!
ChrisMD goalkeeper aren't getting paid enough. idk how much they're getting paid but it's still not enough
Brilliant video but cant help but feel like we were missing Danny Aarons
bro brought in the entire football multiverse
Those entrances were epic
Does anyone know what happened to Ollie he hasn’t been in a video for ages
That ending with Simon >>>>
Enjoyed this 😂😂
The final Simon scene tho 😂
the fact I watch these videos for literally Arthur and George is embarrassing
40 seconds in and already crying by the fact Theo came from an ambulance 😭😭😭
Having not seen the video yet, I all ready know Harry's shots are gonna be diabolical.
JCC used to be my captain when we played for Fleetwood Town. Kid only scores bangers
Cole Anderson and Fosh😀
Tubes the 🐐
Absolutely ridiculous content again. Phenomenal 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Before an hour viewers 👇🏾
no defenders, sunday league goalkeepers... all goals were pretty average
What a vid
GOLDBRIDGE BALL STRIKES AGAIN
Class
not having simon, tobi, danny and stephen tries in this vid is criminal
Chris not making a video without KSI,Tobi and Simon is insane
Joe Weller and Behzinga should’ve been on the same challenge so we get some fight build up
4,108 shots = FAR too much time on your hands Chris 😂that’s insane
One of the best strikes of a football I’ve ever seen wow
Hi don’t like this comment
Genuinely love this mandems content Love from South Africa 🇿🇦
Assembled the UK youtubers
How you forget miniminter😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😮😮😮😮😮😮😅😅😅😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😂😂😂😂😂😂😢😢😢😢
you are short and basically french, my cousin wants to scrap with u, please accept the challenge and duel with him. xx
max fosh is the most underated player
watching this video gives me massive throwbacks. im just happy i got to see joe weller
Always excited for a Chrismd upload! Quality over quantity. That intro was truly epic and what a way to end it. One of your best in a long time
A football creator creating a football related video is really rare nowdays
Weller the goat
Pls reply to my comment I played at the fortress and it was special ur the goat
WELLERS RETURN
This video needed Simon and Tobi 😢😂😂😂
dub intro fr
Where is danny
bro shouldve called it football challenge with youtube shorts fc LOL
I bet Tobi, Manny & Simon could do a better goal each in 100 shots than everyone in this video.
Number 3 would have won if Chris didn't do it. Best goal of the vid by far personally
one of the best intros in youtube history
ngl chris' volley from the cross which is top 4 was way better than the top 1 goal
Number 3 was insane
romell and tobi on fiiiire banging vid!
Upset that Tom had one shot in the video
Chris puts so much effort into his videos, every video is a masterclass
Ally law has had a glow up 💀💀💀
Chris is actually so class this feels like an avengers movie
Thought Tom Garratt knew football😕
dont agree
Honestly Chris’ number 3 goal was by far the best, crazy goal
Joe weller in a video i didn't expect that happy to see him really
Endgame is the most ambitious crossover ever. This video:
@24:46 - Dread it, run from it, destiny arrives all the same.
That intro Avengers sequence was crazyyyy
25 seconds in and it's already a banger
Probably didnt invite Simon and Tobi because they would have taken up the entire top 10
No Simon and tobi This is rigged
AVENGERS ASSEMBLE!
the editing on this video is mad 🔥
That angle makes the shot look so much better 8:14
This video>>>
Insane!
nice to see weller back in a video. british youtube goat back in the day
i was waiting for simon..
Simon and Tobi ? Where are they ? :( Tobi could have scored a beautiful Trivela and Simon a beautiful Rabona !    Just joking, I wish they were there but this video is still a banger loved the top 2 goals beautiful !!
Cons transformation is insaneeeee
Chris you should collab with Kieran Brown
Each video the standard goes higher then we can imagine
Honestly, one of the best videos I’ve ever watched
Simon,Tobi and stephen have sadly died
Yes joe wellerrrrr
What a YouTube throwback. Joe and Caspar together was class!!!
The amount of Goldbridge reaction clips used is astonishing
Chris’s volley in 3rd place was an absolute banger
The ending was perfect
I didn't think Chris was that small, until this video.
love your videos
Ollie’s gained a few ngl
@CrunchyMotorsport Chris not making a vid without drinking feels like I’m in a alternate universe
after watching yet another banger from mr Christopher MD, I can happily say he is the best football youtuber to grace my screen.
Those first 40 seconds hyped me the  f up! What an opener
miniminter coming for the top 10 next vid
Why is it when Chris scores he giggles like a kid on Christmas
Another banger keep it up❤‍🔥🔥
you're gonna tell me the shot at 8:43 is actually real???
Kon looking fit proud of him
Jaackmaate's intro 😂
Where is Simon
I absolutely love that Fosh has out of nowhere become some kind of B-list YouTube footballer now. Never doubted you Max. Stay silly.
Props to goalies
The planning and editing on this is IMMACULATE !
best intro ever
That was the best intro I have ever seen
The aura that comes of Joe in videos no wonder he’s famous
That’s a lot of shots..
Yay another vid thank you chris
Simon in the end hahahahaha
This intro❤
That goal from smithy was INSANE😮‍💨🤩
Chris is actually fkcn insane
That goal wasn’t seen 10 minutes and 11 seconds in why😢
Me waiting for miniminter……..
In any other scenario, Cole and Jack would be an elite duo 😅
CRAZY VID!!! Definitely one of the best football vids i have watched in a while. Keep it up Chris!!!😄
Insane vid
This might be top 10 best videos on YouTube 2023
No Minter 😢
Joe Weller is so funny 😂 made the video
4000 shots… What a weak day for Harry 😅😅
WELLER MASSIVE W!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Chris decided not to include Miniminter to give the others a chance
one of the best football videos
I like that Joe is back in YouTube videos
So confused at the ending😂😂
Simon at the end
Power and Precision was so close to scoring so many worldies
No Simon? i get it, dont want him to take all top 10 spots.
Unreal video
anyone know the song that plays when Cal first appears?
Great to see Weller on a vid!
Love football vids from you
Best intro for a Football video I've ever seen in my life! Absolutely smashed it!
No Simon is criminal
Bro Simon in the end
whos that stoke guy
Honestly, your videos have been so quality these years. That intro was so cool. Happy to see you so passionate with what you do (:
Simon at the end made me sad 😢 he should’ve been in this video
Wait you're telling me that's NOT Ally Law?? 😭
this has got to be the biggest collab and best intro to a yt video EVER haha. End of Vid edit: that top 10 was crazy especially no. 1
The ending portal with Simon finished me 💀😭😭
Chris' Manager: Who should we organise a collab with?  Chris: Yes.
Love these vids
We'll look back at this video in a few years as one of the Football YouTube greats. So many moments are going to be classic clips for years 😂
Simon minter was missed dearly
What a video. Full of stars. Great stuff
The first time Chris has made a smooth Segway into an ad
No Simon?😢
Jack falling all the time was probably my favorite moment of the video
Simon at the end was such a random but hilarious conclusion
Weller still as funny as always. what a king
11:29 Is Mark Goldbridge actually 29?
that intro is the best thing ever
this guest list is amazing
That was legit Zidane esque
Simon at the end 😭 ik bro would’ve been in the top ten for sure
Oh my Wellers in a vid let’s go
Miniminter 😧😭
That intro was gold
I am just grateful to live in the same era as the greatest footballer to ever grace the earth "CALLUX"
great vid lads! your insane!
Seeing Joe and Casper in the same vid was lowkey wholesome
John's shot should be higher, that was so clean
4,000 shots is a whole lot to only say our top 10 were crazy
Nice to see Joe Weller in the vid!
I bloody love ollie. Brings back memories
Theo’s entrance was really clever and funny, given his hip might’ve given out from the entrance itself.
Incredible collab video
Love your videos 0:12
Wheres danny Arrons
whoever edited yhis video must get a raise
Chris scared of Simon as usual
MCU has been real quiet since this dropped...
Kon booting the ball at criss was so unexpected 😂
That intro is crazy 🔥🔥🔥🫶🏻
Ok but that intro 😻
14:52 “Thai Women” - that’s just mean. 😭
Watched the last one replayed a lot. So happy!
This is definitely one of the greatest intros in youtube history
That sponsor transition was too cold
Mark Goldbridge still got it 💪💪💪
Zidane-esqe at the end there
Chris pls upload more love watching your videos you should do another video with Aaron ramsdale and you should do another one of the 1 yard shot all the way to 50 yards this time
YESS ANOTHER VID
Top video Chris, needs more alcohol tho
Brilliant. Made me smile... and that's enough!
that ending was genuinely one of the best endings ive seen in any youtube video, 2 bangers consecutively, the coldplay music, everything was perfect ❤🎉
16 mins
The editing is top tier!
The amount of people that almost scored a worldie on their first attempt is crazy
Olly is more like Kevin De Burger these days
Kons calves could take on Stephen thighs
I was only here because i saw harry
What an intro!
