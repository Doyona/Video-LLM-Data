That was a talent rendered with grace from a beautiful soul. Wow.🎉
BGT's mistake was giving MB14 the gold buzzer and MB14 went straight into the semifinals because if they didn't give them the gold buzzer we could see MB14's performance in each round and enjoy their performance

Can't count how many times i've watched this
Love you Muhammad❤
Dude literally made a song from scratch infront of thousands in person and millions on screen now that alone deserves a contract
BGT is way better than AGT(I'm American). I can't stand Bruno as a Judge and I also don't like Howie LOL. Alisha, Amanda, & Simon for judges and Ant & Dec...they're the best!
After he got golden buzzer a song play name of the song plzz
It’s ridiculous this guy didn’t even get to the final, literally the most talented and unique act they’ve had in a long time and they just threw it away
He might be born in France but you can't take the "Algerian hand shake" out of him
Who is here in June 2024?
HE HAS THE SMILE OF GOD <3
Am I the only woman here who thinks: This man is simply 100% ? I mean talent…the smile…eveything? 😨😰😱🥰
MB14. You came to entertain the audience and not expect a golden buzzer. But the golden buzzer wants you
Well deserved!!
Please like my comment 😊so I can come back to this guy best in world
He is amazing, great audition 🔥
This man is truly blessed by the gods

Leron-Leron sinta, UK Version!
Pure talent, no nonsense 👍
I could see this a million times and I would not get tired!! Two things to say!: How cool he moves his hands as if he was drawing the sounds!. And what about the quality of the sound?? Unbelievable engineering sound work!!
U will allways be second, third maybe fourth ! "Saro" destroyed u 😂
I like how most of the judges were lowkey vibing, and then there was Simon who had the expression of “wat” the whole time
DJS LOSING THEIR JOB WITH THIS ONE
Vera level performance❤
Hope this open more contracts for him to be mainstream.
Start here 2:45
Good job brother

HE SAYS GE IS FROM FRABCE...HE LOOKS MORE MIDDLE EAST....HE HAS THE NOSE....HE ALSO MADE ME CRY AT 1ST GLANCE BECAUSE HE REMINDED ME OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST
If I were there I would fly to the stage and take the mic then SCREAM OUT SO SO LOUD like I never did. Then say "I got nothing to tell more". The End🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩👏👏👏👏👏👍👍👍👍👍
As a beatboxer myself, he is very talented. I know how to do some of the stuff he could produce, but he’s professional.
GOD DAMN

Simon sampai diam begitu,pasti dia kagum banget
Siapa nama pria ini. Maaf saya baru melihatnya 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Phenomenal, historic! This will always be remembered!!!
mb14 just blows me away everytime
Why is he even here lol.. he's already an accomplished artist and has more fame than the judges lol.
MB 14 is weaving his music in front of our ears... one loop at a time.  A one man musician instantly creating magic. We can't believe how surprising and how good it feels. We are floating away for 2 minutes... This is ART at its finest. Bravo Mohamed
I waited for a badass drop 🥺

Sometimes i just wish that the audience would stop clapping so i can enjoy the freaking audition
MB14 não é desse mundo!!!
3:04 isn't that the 'Name 3 books!' kid?
You like him ? Just look MB14 vs SARO  Saro at his prime is better than him 🇨🇵🇨🇵 French talent, vive la France
4:50 Brp started to try and summon some other world being 😂😂😂
You can see how humble he is. His parents must be very proud of him and my due respect to the parents, they raised a beautiful soul
What this song the final clip? Please
MB14 forgot to talk about his time at the World Beat Box Championships. or the other GoT's he's been on.
He is an orchestra🥶

he's Muslim beatboxer from France. Muhammad Belkheir
So, question: who copied who? Tom Thum on May 4th 2013 performed for TedX a very similar thing…is this Indian script a very common one among beatboxers? I am not an expert, just asking?!?
Wow 😊

Красавчик так красиво ❤
❤❤❤❤❤
Mohamed called his Numidian ancestors
Bro is not doing beatboxing, He's  boxing with beats ..
Bgt is emotiona 🥹
Love from India North East ❤️❤️❤️❤️
This stuff is better than magic or stand-up comedy. It brings a smile to your face, like it or not😊😊😊😊  Who agrees?
He has this John Travolta smile. very talented man.
that was the most complex composed music ive ever heard, it brings the middle east vibes more than anything with a modern things, and it comes only from his mouth
Special Thanks Ant & Dec
Oh that's still him 💀

Hi
Love ❤ mb14
ايش اسم الاغنيه  what is the name of song
❤🎉
❤❤❤❤❤❤
His only reason of elimination is that he is a muslim
Name of that song when he won ?? 🙏
Can you tell me about name control song?
You got skills bro!
I love you Muhammed.🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷
Increable Man.❤
I haven't watched BGT for years so maybe I'm out of the loop... was Simon in a car accident?
Amazingggg 🔥
I Can't Belive He's the same MB14 whO sings GamgstaParadise at Voicee🔥🔥🔥🔥 Outstanding Performance.....And A Great REVOLUTION 🔥❣️@MB14BEATBOX
KEEP GOING BECAUSE YOU ARE THE BEST WELCOME TO MARRAKECH
If you didn't know him or of him nor of this music genre& community yet, go check for instance the video published on YouTube with the title :  " MB14 live at German Beatbox Championship 2019 " (although, as for his cover of Coolio's Gangsta' Paradise on that day, it was not even the best he can do, IMHO). Or, one of the most watched & enjoyed battles ever : " MB14 vs SARO | Grand Beatbox LOOPSTATION Battle 2017 | SEMI FINAL "    just paste the titles and enjoy.  Also noteworthy,  MB14 also competed on TheVoiceFrance in 2016, and again, as an 'All Star' in 2021... He is recognised by his peers and already has a fanbase, but he might become one of the beatboxers&loopers, like Sam Perry, to widen the net and let the genre get more popular yet. I'd like 'older' generations to come to appreciate it too... One can always dream...  PS.  Ah, and I almost forgot to mention the song he did for the soundtrack of the movie Tenor : "  MB14 - MA PLACE (BO du film « TÉNOR »)  "  in which we can hear that MB can SING ..
Tu es très doué, j'ai vu plusieurs vidéos de toi, je te souhaite d'aller très loin. Ne t'arrête pas, vas jusqu'au bout !
@yoshi93
Fun fact::::::: He don't need dj Dj needs him ......
Masha Allah Brother , ❤Love from Indonesia

Amazing
valorantta tutunamayınca müziğe saran harbor
this guy lost to some clown jumping around in a balloon, which is something literally anyone could do, but all these "talent" shows, don't really pick real talent, they just pick whatever the fans think is good, so if the fans think jumping balloon man was better, jumping balloon man it is.
nothing special ... a lot of beatboxers do this and way much better .... I feel I am watching a Bollywood clip, the amount of exaggeration and drama LOL
It would have been nice if not everyone talked during the while song
This is sah gringe they dont even try to pretend how staged/set up it is -_- rip
hes a greek god
❤❤❤suuuuper!
Simon clapping like a proud father 😂🥰
On godddd
Fenomenal
I still have no idea how this guy was beaten by a guy who takes off hi-vis beats and jumps around a bit.
😮😮
Lets go Muhammad, Assalamu'alaykum
Yes yes yes yes fantastic 👌🫵
Tres Bien joue Simon not a peep
He should've won this, but he didn't had a sad life story to tell.
For those who don't know him , he is the M from BERYWAM 😉🙌🏼♥️🥰 Eshhh 🎉🎉
It is the machine not his mouth
I really enjoy listening to him. His growth over the years is unmatched. Love it
You are amazing! Your voice is amazing! Well done from Hungary

I watched him on a video a few years back he's Great
I wish i could do that so that I won't need real instruments to make songs. A very spectacular performance. I couldn't even stop my hands from clapping until my kids came and grabbed my hands because I've been clapping for about 2 minutes. 😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅.
His hand movements played a huge role in engaging the audiences. Great showmanship!
'I thought I would also be on the stage but I'm in the audience' 💀💀
So good ❤
Everyone pretending to love the french, cheers must have been added in
You're so polite and sweet. This makes you deserve more. All the best 😊

TALENTA DI ATAS RATA-RATA  ❤
Fake! It's not him doing those noises. Pay attention 4:06 when he starts touching his equipment. Sounds keep coming even though the microphone is down.😂😂😂
This guy is from different universe..creating his own genre
Mb14 already famous beatbox
واااه موهوب
Great performance but, Tom Thum did almost this exact performance on Tex X about 10 years ago.
What M416 🤨

Bonne utilisation du "looping en musique"!!!
I love his smile but I'm sad that he would use his full name Muhammad which is a beautiful name
I don't even know how many times I've watched this. Such a sweet, talented, humble (though really good looking) young man! He totally deserved that golden buzzer! His music was enchanting!! Wherever he is, I hope he's still making music!!!
I want to see that girl that thought she would be on stage one day who was in the audience get to the stage.

3:30 Lip sync timing 😂
For people listening to him the first time :  He is ex member of Berywam (the ones who rocked AGT stage twice)  Berywam name comprises of 4 beatboxers ( you can search them on youtube ) they all are french champions Be : Beatness Ry : Rhythmind Wa : wawad M : Mb14 (replaced by the new guy now)  Mb14 is in this video, but he has served in berywam for over 10 years. They won many international beatbox championships together. But mb14 wasn't getting the fame he needed so he left for a solo journey.  You can follow more at swissbeatbox and beatbox international youtube channels. And BeatboxBattleTV for every 4 year world champs.

He is so good and very handsome! His looping is similar to Sam Perry, the winner of the voice.
This could easily be the new BGT anthem :)))
I seen this guy yearsssss ago I knew he would be a f****ng superstar

The "i dont know where youve been" "ive been in france" is a hamilton reference

Best of luck to this dude. I  showed my granny the Ganger Paradise and she was speechless - first time in  82 years she listened to even a cover of rap songs. He's got a wonderful future ahead.

This Is So Cinematic.
youtoube 100%, computer 100%, speakers 100%.....f the neighbours, they also loved it
that he didnt win over viggo is JUST A JOKE A GIANT MESSED UP JOKE
If you want the background music after the performance from 5:27 to 7:00, find Celestial

Amazing performance ❤ & you're a muslim so double love from me ❤❤
Amazing mb14... i fans you so much...
คุนคือทาเรนท์

めっちゃ好きなんだけど 途中から「ハンディ・パス・パス」か「パンティー・貸す・貸す」と空耳して神秘さが消し飛んだ日本人おらん？？

He is complete package‼️I love him for an action. film😍😍
4:54 repeat repeat repeat repeat repeat repeat repeat repeat 🔥🔥🔥🔥
He so smart...and handsome..
It was 80 Percent Fake Performance & Here is the Proof 4:07 At 4:10 You will See The Reality of This Fake Performance
Anthony David McPartlin and  Declan Donnelly❤ HEART'S BEAT of 💎BGT💎
If he looked like Onka Judge no one would press golden buzzer.
4:50 it sounds like we are fighting the final boss from a video game
Such a gentleman, showing his manners 🙌
موهبة عضيمة❤👍
I got goosebumps when he chanted that
Gendeng cuk suarane
Totally worthy Golden buzzer!
This is what the legend Jim Morrison was talking about when he predicted music in the future
why not...its proof he do its
MASHALLAH ❤❤❤❤FROM INDONESIA 🇮🇩

Now I know why France doesn't do this show..FGT..😂😂😂
EDAAAANNNNN...   GILAAAAAAAAA...   AMAAAAAAZING...
He’s talented and hot . Dayum
My LEGEND😭
If he had chosen this song for the semifinals, his fate would have been different. I didn't enjoy his performance in the semifinals.
Anyone one knows the song in the end?
dayum amazing
This has to win this
Saya tdk mengerti apa itu beatboxing tapi pas liat penambilan orang ini say bener-bener kagum, sukses terus semoga panjang umur Aamiin 😊
Alhamdulilah… congrats Muhammad
This really is tye greatest beatbox performance ever. 4:05 doesn't fail to give me the chills.
Simon´s face changed quickly from this 😃 to 😮.
D mnit ke 5 cwe baju putih pke kca mata yg nonton meakhel jakson smpe nangis.

I am from India, I have not heard such a thing till date, I  Love That
The other tune is recorded while he's removing the mic from his mouth
Today June 19 is MB14's birthday. Let's wish him together a "Happy Birthday" and a lot of success in his career.
Americans going to start bumping middle eastern house music 😂
We want more beatboxer and loopers to come on big stages like this 🖤

Mo has deserved this for awhile.
Magnifique !
Iloveyou boy your my idol🥳
This tune can be perfectly use in Indian horror movie
I discovered you with the gangsters paradise vid years ago good to see how far you have come
Come onnnn, the guy was at the Voice France like 6-7 years ago, he finished second or third place at the time. I have been following him since. He has won most beat box competitions, why on earth would  he want to lose his rights to this lame show!!!
The build-up and layering are ah mayyyyzinggggg❤❤❤
If this becomes an official song, it’ll be among the top of my playlist
CN we just talk about the track being perfect for this moment..❤
I like your attitude bro so calm and gentle
Bro absolutely deserved every ounce of praise he received. His energy and demeanor and passion were just infectious and exhilarating. And the music was so fun.
Vvv impressive love you bro ❤

MB-14  you are definitely got what it takes to be the best! Good Luck! Too You! TOTALLY Awesome!!! 😲🙂

He Deserved. Well Done 🎉
ماشاءالله فمه فرقة كاملة 👄
Legend
Absolutely awesome. You are a legend and have earned your place in my history!
What amazes me is ots like NO ONE there had EVER watched a beat boxer before?? Like ever...... i mean its not exactly new.....
this would be great for a john wick scene!! i can see how john is slaughtering 200 men with this beat!!😅
Assalammualaikum Muhammad.. u r superb.. May Allah Blesses u til end of urlife.. Me from Malaysia
Instagram of the one in white please minute 05:00
Amaziiiing !! Tu es fantastique. J'espère de tout cœur que tu gagneras le titre ❤❤❤
Generally I really don't like beatbox but man that was impressive.
if  berywam you put it together, it will be more exciting like that 👍👍
Amazing 😍
Reminds me of Tokio Myers.
Middle east people always looks so beautiful 😍
LEBOSS
Your face fits a new character on Disney
Well done Muhammad! Super proud of u..  U were out of this world!
You deserve the golden buzzer
Franchement bravo à lui!!! Son talent est incroyable
Megahorosh
Keren
A L U C I N A N T E
Woahhhhhh ❤
Gila sihh keren banget
Cool
He should fly to America and perform. Heck I'd give a 1000.00 for him to do this and some time on stage in Colorado up in the mountains.
His smile is Soo  catchy 😌🤗
Simon's face being awestruck is amazing lol
Roof station haha 😄
@MB14 YOU'RE A LEGEND! As salaam alaikum!
A whole desert them song lmao
He is named Mohammed and he wanted to demonstrate some halal music, and the producers probably thought that was too Muslim and changed his named to MB14
Recorded voice 😁😄
Kicked back as if I was watching a live concert. This guy is phenomenal and deserves to go far, if not win!
Dude MB14 is the best. And the dude at 3:41, he's in all the loopstation battle videos, legend.
IT IS GOOD BUT BERYWAM WAS MUCH BETTER
DLA MNIE TYM WYSTĘPEM WYGRAŁ  TEN PROGRAM.BEZ WZGLĘDU  NA TO JAK PREZENTOWALI SIE INNI.GOSC Z INNEJ  PLANETY.DZIEKUJE DO WIDZENIA
He's beautiful!
mb14 is a legend also id lov to se judges reaction to other gbb greats codfish,d low,napom,kennyurban,king inertia,vocodah an many more
Really love him smile 😂
Suddenly every female ppl there find out themselves pregnant 😂
Wow super human
4:30 the best part omd
Hide yo wife, hide yo daughters
Great....!!!
That was insane, this guy could literally win it!
He didn't even mention that we finished 2nd in The Voice France. And it's an incredible achievement. Why?? And how Simon didn't know about him?
The most stunning performance I had ever seen on all of these shows....He was confident, talented and most importantly so humble...🖤😍
To me it felt so rushed, because his actual track was like around 3 minutes, but then I realized he only has a minute or so. This was absolutely amazing either way, we're proud of you MB14!
Mind blown,how you didn't win is beyond me
Oh my!!! 😮🫨
ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE  that was 1 of the coolest things ive EVER seen/heard in my life
Beat its so good
Amazing❤🎉
14 baby
Be honest this is not your first time watching this
Wow, good stuff bro
You are amazing ,i like you  ✌️😄
Which song bitbox
HE IS GETTING OLD🧐🧓 BUT HIS TALENT IS STILL YOUNG❤️❤️🎈
damn. loved it. first time a beatboxer caught my attention
Editors went to town with this video... amazing🔥
This video just makes me happy
Wow its amazing....!!
You can't connect a mic to an electric device and expect people to really believe what you did.
His opera is impressive
Amazing talent
All the respect to Viggo Venn, but MB14 deserve the win this year, he lost to a kid who sing opera while MB14 do opera as a side quest ... the only audition in BGT history that got that much reaction from the fans and the judges that they were dancing !
Mon dieu!!! Quel talent . Et français ❤️
The God of sound is so modest.
This was an amazing performance by without any musical instruments. Well deserved Golden Buzzer 🎉🎉
May allah bless you
Great job mohammed ❤❤❤❤❤
He coule have played this in the semi final....Damn nothing can out do this
Dude said getting four votes for yes would be perfect. Clearly, he underestimated the possibility of getting a GB. I have listened to this audition dozens of times and still get goosebumps
Unbelievable brother 🤩
Sounds Arab music I love it 🥰
7,2 Mio Views and the most untalented guy named "Viggo" won...
Harbor out here beatboxing and goes hard with it
Simon the whole time:  ( :o ) his mind the whole time: *Wow*  also me:  (o_o)  my mind: *how?!*
Amazing 😮😮😮
What was funny and made me love him was while he spoke to and and dec he dropped a few words in and thats how us brits used to chat to french cod players back in the day 😂😂😂😂
That is true talent 🎉 oof
The best performance from MB14 i have watched.
I wish he would have asked the audience to shut up before he started it. Everyone everywhere deserved to hear that raw and the audience ruined what could have been... Either way well done and very much deserved!!!
That is THE most impressive beatbox sound I have ever heard in my life and I've heard some good beatboxers in my years. Absolutely stunning! Bravo sir!! I was rocking to that!!!  👏 👏 👏
I can make music.  MB14: nah, I am music bruv
Honestly I don't think it was THAT good, like yeah the crowd was at an uproar but that's the equivalent of being a dj like bro there's been professional beatboxers who don't need equipment on stage and lost, but this guy won because he made a Mashup beatbox recording?
This is crazy
amazing, pure talent
You the best.... i love it...
Legend
❤
A band could have produced much better music altogether   Idk if they are "so" impressed by the guy's talent   Or if they were really enjoying his music🙄
Awesome!!! I want the 10 minite version of this beat!!!
I love how everyone is dancing and stuff. Simon 👁👄👁
Imagine, if SARO join the party🎉🎉🎉
Reminds of Tom Thum he's the OG of this type of beatbox he'd done it on Ted Ex
I would listen to you in the car all the time ,, Amazing bro 😍
Musical rizz
It feels like reading a novel of Amin Maalouf. Great performance.
I feel like im in Arabia or the dessert or atleast egypt😂
what a beat 🔥
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
AKU BUAT KONTEN SEPI TERUS TAPI TETAP SEMANGAT BUAT KONTEN UNTUK MENGHIBUR KALIAN SEMUA..🔥
Bro literally produced the soundtrack for a desert themed video game
Amazing brother
just try and imagine for a second how this guy must feel in this moment. I don't know if I've ever felt happiness on that kind of level before. incredible.
i'm not just saying this because I am bisexual, but that man could have any human on this planet that he desired, male, female or otherwise. that being said, i am officially hard.
Good job brother ❤❤❤❤
and where is he today ... ? i am already bored
his accent sounds like he's an American through 95% of what he speaks 🤣
Lucky to attend this concert, it was not an audition 🥲
I watch you 6 times now. Thats perfect keep doing it you are already a star. Love u muslim bro.
This is insane!!!!
3:41  Even Paul McCartney is impressed.
I’ve seen some amazing soul touching. Performances over all the years of bgt and agt and this one brought me to other worlds!!!!! Is he single 😩 bc I’m a Pelletier I can speak some French 😂😂😂
Bruno sounds like grimmol from how to train your dragon 3
Brooo he's smile is tooooooo cute😭
Goosebumps 😮❤
Omg! Respect!  Take my all money bro. Its a gift for you
Nothing new to see here...been done a million times by many people.
what in the main character
Je me souviens de ce mec, il y a très longtemps où il avait participé à The Voice ! Toujours aussi incroyable et un talent de ouff !
The best🎉
C'est le mec du Film Ténor !!!! je l'ai pas reconnu au début ! @mb14 ta voix est juste MAGNIFIQUE !!! keep up the good work, on veut te voir encore plus :D
Ngerii🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is the Masterpiece 🔥🔥..One Man Show😎
Goosebumps bro.. congratulations ❤
He isssss awwsomeeeee.....he is gonna win this competition...no doubt
BEST EVER... KEEP DOIN WHAT YOU R DOIN. YOU JUST GOT ANOTHER FAN FROM ANOTHER WORLD.
That was INCREDIBLE!!!  I actually got out of my chair and was dancing to the beat.  I would love for him to release this on an album!
It's sad that BGT probably doesn't know the true significance of Celestial by Ed Sheeran 😒 5:34
They used Celestial for the background music when the performance was over and now I just wanna go back to playing Pokemon Violet
He make an egyptian movie soundtrack
LETSSS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
We share the Name, look at my Name 💥
Best bgt or agt performance EVER
Magnífico
It's beautifull beatbox ever
Full song release NOW !
ada kodok, suaranya kodokodokk
That is so beautiful I am listening this so many times. Is there song somewhere I can listen this . Which song it is
brilliant
Omg...!!
Congratulations, and God will always be with you all the time ❤🎉
와...몇번을 봐도 볼때마다 소름이 돋네요! 너무 멋져요~^^
That's the real talent bro❤
How many of you came here after watching the shorts?😂
The best reaction of them all was seeing Simon stunned in his chair in absolute disbelief!!! OMG!!! Never seen him that stunned!!! ❤ Well deserved Golden buzzer!!! ❤
That's well deserved! i love listen beatbox and you just took it next level 😄
Well done Mohammad
I’ve seen this type of act several times over the past few years….this dude made me feel like this is the first time I’ve ever seen it done! 😍🙌🏼
Be honest, you smiled goofily throughout the video alone staring at the screen
This really was incredible to watch. One of the most deserved golden buzzers in the history if this show.
Amazing 😮😊
ESH!!
Brhuuuuuuuuuuuu🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
A french beatboxer make arabic sound in britain's got talent
Absolutely wonderful. It's not just physical beauty but the talent will forget you to think he could get golden button and just embrace the sound the talent
Name song, this last videos 🙏
this is what we called talent...
Now we are only missing saro to join some bgt to really show how incredibly talented beatboxers are
Did they forget about this guy or something? How did he not get the wildcard?
David😢
I absolutely love Viggo Venn but this guy totally deserved to win. One of the best auditions there's ever been. How he didn't even get to the final is criminal
knowing him from the voice, it's weird when he says fourteen instead of quatorze 😂
Wow... MANTAP BROOO👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Prince of Persia is in the house.
And the winner is a man wearing a hi viz !!!!😂,
4:54 fire bro 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
So proud that he represents France (since he's French) !
Still can’t believe MB14 was this good & also in his semi final & didn’t get to the Final. A guy who wears pants whilst doing silly poses & a guy who dances in a hi-vis jacket (and who ends up winning it) however do. No justice - we love your work MB14. Keep the faith my friend ✅
😲Wow
Best golden buzzer is ant & dec's because they agree with each other with they ayes only.
ยอกเยี่ยมที่สุดเท่าที่ผมเคยดูมาละ
MashaAllah brother.
MB14 you are Gorgeous...this is real talent ❤
He makes his own show.
After all these years of watching MB14 he finally got what he deserved.
3:50
I want to hear without music
Bằng một điều gì đó khiến tôi xem lại bài thi của anh ấy không dưới 10 lần 🎉😅 . Tuyệt vời .
Whaaaaaaat !! 🔥🎉 can't stop watching this magic
That smile is infectious ❤️
He is different
🤯
PUBG PAROH THEME ARTIST😀
such a loving smile from mb14
Look how happy Roman Reigns when he is outside of his comfort zone .. Well done my Tribal Chief .
Монтаж просто огонь!
Saro and MB14. Two of my favourites in beatboxing 🔥
Guy looks like neymar😂
JUSTO!!! Merecedor, parabéns ao artista! Muito sucesso sempre!!!!
This is awesome
The reason why this is 100× better than his semifinals is because of his build ups and audiences' anticipation of what he will do next. His semifinals, good, but right from the start, everybody knows what's gonna happen. But with this one, no one knows what he's going to do next, and straight up murdered the entire stage.
Power of music is uniting people, power of religion is dividing people... More music, less religion please!
You really deserved the golden buzzer by ant and Dec
Love you MB14
looks like ppl like witcher mixed with persian music :)
congratulation mohammad..i like your talent brother..
I never saw or heard something like It. This guy is so talented.
❤❤love this in this years
And he is gorgeous so that does not hurt.
@MB14BEATBOX 5 years with the same oriental beat, like it but now need to heard other things....and you are more than capable, hope to see that ASAP.
Its fake synchronized look deeply
Amazing …:
Did great with berywam but nailed it solo. Grats to you mb14. More beats to come. No hate i love berywam and mb14 and other beatboxers with what they do. Respect!
Nice video like always..
That was absolutely amazing the skill and control. Well deserved golden buzzer definitely one of my favorites.
Truly Undeniable!!! SIMON was stuck!!!
his golden smile is everything we need
British accent has left the chat
Amazing...🎉
this is a super /briliant/wondefull tallent😍😍😍🤩🤩🤩
MB14 is my favorite beatboxer since 2018❤
Dang hes good! Watching this for the 70th time..never a dull moment..congrats n keep it up..
😮😮😮😮😮😮
I'll never get over the fact that the Celestia song was made for Pokemon. Totally caught me off guard when I first heard it in game.
I think everyone who sees this, just loves every second of it. ❤🎉
MB14 sound familiar   totally from the voice France
I felt like I was watching a music video, Simon give this guy a contract!
love you Mohammed 😊❤
He said BGT  Could've said Mb14 in the song.
imagine if he had a voicecrack💀
what’s name this backsound?
Badaaassss
We need more MB14. I listen to this more than once every day. :)
The goat finally changed it
Vous devez chanter une chanson francaise aussi❤
C'etait magnifique❤️
🇩🇿 👌💪
Check out BeardyMan - he’s been doing similar for many years! This was awesome.
Who is watching after final results, This is REAL TALENT vigo won without Talent but with just One More time slogan. Sorry vigo it’s funny but it’s not talent. People’s champ is MB14🗣️💔🫵🏻
Annnndddd the Winner is VEGO freakin Venn !! -_-
In the last two weeks this is perhaps the 50th time I am watching your video. You are absolutely phenomenal😮😮😮. Thanks for giving out such amazing pieces of beatboxing.
Dude just took me to the middle east with those beats 🙌🔥🔊👌 Keep it up bro  Mash-allah my braca❤
Good that it's not just "oh wow he can sing and has a sad backstory about his parents just dying" yeah, singers exist they're not that exiting anymore
WAIT THIS GUY WAS ON THE VOICE FRANCE
Arabic music is so cool, even if you make it Rock, Metal, or Music like this(on this video), I love hearing Arabic style Music, that's really cool type of music !!!  sorry if my English not good !!!
(beat boxing guy) jesus incoming
MB14 Have a nice journey,, Good luck to you my friend you're a Legend in beatboxing👍 We are here to support you.. from PHILIPPINES🇵🇭 💯👍

I cried out of amazement! This is awesome!! This is someone that broke through their limits!! Bravo!!!
Hand some ya Allah ❤❤❤❤
I could listen to a whole album of his ill will tell you that
So talented and soooo good looking. Sad he wasn't in the Final 😍
Creepy old man
ive been watching MB14 for a long time with GBB and others. Great to see him really taking off like this.
🤮 Bruno's reaction when the guy walked out onstage 🤢  Other than that putridness, the man is amazing!
Confident and humble all at once. Amazing talent.
Вот это Я понимаю талант вот это уровень mb14  брат я не удивился давно слежу за его творчеством
MB14 (MBXIV) is awesome. He deserved that golden buzzer and should have got that spare wild card, not the guy in pants! Jeez! That was just a ludicrous waste of a wild card! And the winner... words defy! What were the british public thinking of! I'm sure King Charles would much prefer to watch and listen this MBXIV, who is our winner and our new favourite go to artsiste. 'GO DOWN' is well worth a listen too.
The power of music. Touching especially when it's original, creative, enjoyable and make people move,
Bro that was beyond incredible! I've seen MANY beat boxers and loopers. But you have something so unique and special. Truly amazing!!! Cannot wait to hear more
Ain't no way Viggo Venn won BGT and MB14 didn't.
He is the real winner 2023
Hands down the best audition in bgt history, followed by Signature
I'm now a fan of beatboxing. Absolutely incredible.
Wow ❤Wow!  He wanted to make you get up and dance!!!❤
❤
Bruno on fire ! Man Bruno should be in every season what a personality haha
WOW!!!!!!!!!
really great and amazing🎉 that is the talent 😊
04:49  The Lord Of The Ring War Mode
5:34 what is song ???
HOLY SHIZ THIS IS SO SICK! AMAZING! THIS DESERVES TO WIN...Seriously AMAZING
super natural talent...  first time in history of  intertainment talent in the whole world...
Its not just talent he worked HARD HARD to manifest that talent respect for this amazing performance
Love a good loop station 💜
When Simon makes that face you know it's not human anymore
Your gonna win man!! And it aint the damn voice, its BGT even bigger and better.
the way simon looked haunted in the beginning to smiling at the end was just great
Top talent 2023❤
Congratzz MB14 , loving seeing one of my idols are showing true talents to the world
ظوبري مانجا
Boss music 🔥
I don’t think I’ve ever seen Simon look this shook before
The only actual "talent" on the show
The audience was prepared for the audition, and they arrived at a show. If at first they were hypnotized with staring eyes, they immediately woke up dancing. Good thing they didn't destroy the hall.😁👍👍👍🙌🙌🎤🎼 🎹🔈 🔉 🔊🎵 🎶🎵 🎶
What is called that type of music at the beginning that he made? sounded like indian or something like that.... I need more of that lol
𝘝𝘌𝘙𝘙𝘠 𝘯𝘪𝘤𝘦
You great MB 14 LOVE YOUR PERFORMANCE
Amazing performance but it's painfully obviously scripted to be a golden buzzer from the start 😭 The shots of the guys pressing the buzzer, and of MB14. Not saying he didn't deserve it, quite the contrary, he put on a great show! I just dislike the way these shows are made nowadays.
I love you mb14
Wonder what would happen if SARO also decides to participate
Where is David
famous for Beatbox ❎  Beatbox is best known for mb14 ✅
MB14 da best! I've had watched him on YouTube beatbox battle.
heard this now. i just say WoW!!! mind blow
2:20 she's still getting to be an audience, and I'm not even in Britain 🥺
Aur ek hai humara dJ bOy SaJiD kHaN
In my opinion, MB14 is the most talented looper of all time. SARO is the most accomplished looper but MB14 is the only one who can really sing, opera sing and rap. Remember, no effects just his VOICE. For me, he is the best beatboxer when it comes to singing and melodic beatboxing. 💯💯💯🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭❤️❤️❤️🎶🎶🎶
Woe this really cool
If he ain’t the wildcard I’ll be vexed
멋지네요 비트링 도 아주 훌륭해요~
His reaction is the worst reaction i hv ever seen..
The most golden moments I have lived in my life by watching this masterpiece
he looks like straight gigachad
Он просто невероятный, я ничего подобного не слышал!🔥🔥🔥 Мега талант, удачи тебе!✌🏻
Fake talent he not use mike he use beatbox see carefully ...............0 % talent .....
Too good🔥🔥
👍👍👍
Wow 🎉🎉 I'm big fan MB14
His smile also talented.!!!
Man if here was saro on the stage he might get the platinum buzzer which is never exist however mb14 is also really good and improved
I’m here who can’t even make my parents happy but seeing him making all the audience happy makes me wana cry ❤
Bravo t'etais fort ....en France il ne reconnaissent pas assez les talents
This guy should make PsyTrance.
show me what you goootttt🗿 (rick n morty)😂
Omg you are a treat to watch 😍😍😍
Wow😮 amazing beatbox wow wow wow...
What a genuine smile.
The sound is hypnotism look audience without blinking they are watching
He has the voice of a god
Extraordinary Performance 👏❤👏🕺💃❤🎶🎵🎼❤🕺💃👏❤
First audition 💯, second not that good
I never thought he could top some of the performances he put together in the loop station battles what a legend, so deserving!
I can’t stop watching this again and again ❤️❤️
Wow! Just wow!
برابو سيد محمد  اسمك كتير حلو وبيرفع الراس الديانة الإسلامية قدام الناس الله يوفقك
Wow, amazing just wow definitely well deserved
Why didn't you tell them your name my friend you have such a wonderful, prolific, marvelous name MUHAMMAD. The whole world even extraterrestrial world is also love this beautiful name.
That is amazing brother Thank u for share your talent 🙏🏻🫂
MB14, One of the best acts I've seen in a long time. Just look how it got EVERYONE bopping on his audition. Now, the semi..... chalk and cheese. If..... IF..... you get a wild card, I hope you do, DONT SING.  Watch your audition, compare the semi. 🤞
Вау
This men must win !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
tbf though i think MENA people are sooooooooooooooooooo talented in music
Wait untill he raps and sings on next round
تضن انك ادا قلت لهم ان اسمك محمد ربما يؤدي لإقصائك لكن ان تستحي من اسم اعظم خلق الله امر مخزي حقا
Awesome, night bird and him 2 best ever
Lets be real, without all the beatbox his singing is qualified as a talent already, he's gifted
Soooooo glad to see you at this show you will do it awesome
Middle Easterners are just the best at everything.
No you come here atleast once a day too watch this!
You are amazing MB14
Love n respect JORHAT ASSAM INDIA🇮🇳
Amazing bro
I am entertained 🎉🎉🎉
3:03 kid, how is he not a meme?
L artist

Oh they don't even know who was on that stage😅😅😅
david looks kinda different
Every woman wants to sleep with him. Every bloke wants to be him
He deserved to win! What a legend! 😢
Is he does his first round, in the finals, from the 2017 GB loopstation semi finals vs SARO he will win this entire show
GG mb14🔥🔥
I don’t know why I cried when they press the golden button. U are awesome！
ganteng, berbakat, goodloking, murah senyum, agama islam  aahhhh mantaap 💕  😂 💪 🤘
O india  te ama MB14
We, people in The United States, need to see this guy doing shows like Coachella, Summerfest &etc. But more specifically Movement and Electric Forest Festival... Because those two are in Michigan and it heightens my chance to see MB14 live. <3 <3 <3 So Happy to discover you today!
👌👌👌👌🔥🔥🔥🔥
Amazing  performance  🎉🎉
Amazing.... 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Mad respect for MB14. I've always been a fan. ❤️ But BGT is a scripted show. I've never seen a show as staged as BGT except WWE. 😂
Wow awesome ❤❤❤❤
Wow awesome ❤❤❤❤
Just imagine a collaboration with the Mayyas? What do you think?  It's going to be 🔥🔥🔥
This is beautiful.. might have shed a tear.
essa apresentação foi surreal!
marvelous skills I envy you .❤
He is such a great talent and a positive person.. love Ant and Deck's choice
Proud of u bro..
Il est vraiment formidable ! 💪  👏👏👏...
Ex berywam member
Fréro tu es le meilleur 🇨🇵
the camera man knows...1:44 and 4:06.
Pretty sure Bruno was willing to give him the second golden buzzert
O melhor do mundo 😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😢❤
Nice to see him get his props. I have been checking his videos. Together with berywam for years
Wtf, and now he is not in the Final?! What?
This even possible
Men, you so really good in fact better
Brilliant, I really enjoyed 🎉
Tears rolled out for ur talent … it’s awesome
LETS GOO MB40!!!! WE LOVE BEATBOX ! ESHHH
Il est d'où ? D'origine
Perfect background music for a Call of Duty  desert mission 😂
Totally Non Deserving Golden Buzzer 👎
Actually Berrywam was much better than this fake beat boxer...  Atleast they did fooled the audience by using musical instrument in beatboxing
I can only see :-  Judges Over Reaction..  He is singing song 80% from musical instrument 20% from mouth....   Not as expected..
Powerful !!!
All the music used and genre are pre 2000 .
Seen him ages ago as i watch beatboxing n loop station, glad to see him getting some recognition guy is fire
bro dropped the most dope assassin's creed theme and no one noticed 🔥
Bizkit would surprise
Amazingly beautiful ❤ Thank You Golden buzzer got me here  You are amazing andhave a beautiful  talent Never Yet seen or heard ❤INCRÍVEL Obrigado Merci

O Brasil te ama MB14
Ça pourrait durer 1 heure, j'écouterais jusqu'au bout.
Yah this is the kind of audition that people look up on YouTube to find it because they heard he’s so amazing!!
His awesome beatbox skills combined with his angel voice is just way to special ❤
I like Ant and Dec .they have really good vibra
Imagine being so talented AND so handsome 😢❤️
Ce son est si envoûtant ! C’est incroyable ! Bravo ⭐️⭐️⚡️🔥
Producers hate this little trick
This guy should win !! For sure he’s got my vote !!❤
The voice(s) of angels 😍
Mohammed deserves to be this year's winner He has my vote and hopefully he will get many more MB14 FOR BGT WINNER
Road to Zion if you reach the final
You know you’ve got a good act, when you’re actually disappointed he got a golden buzzer because now you will get less performances.
Big fan  of mb14 from 4 years
สุดยอดครับ คิดตรีมนี้ออกมาได้โคตรสุดยอด
One word ( Genius )
MB14 the BEST loooooper
Omg lost of words great talent
1:47 LMAO
It is my day 10 watching this clip again and again and again and getting goosebumps!  It is obvious that GBT NEVER EVER had anyone like him!  Like this show was made for long time looking for MB14  His name is Mohammed too, MB14, please come to Qatar! even if you go to Saudia or UAE we will travel to attend MB14-Pyramids!  It has the WOOOOOOWWW FACTOR.🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹
I watched this 100 times and still... watching
Neighboring buildings: 😧😲😩
BRAVOOOOOOOO!!!
Wow after all these years it’s so good to finally see you @BGT. More battles to be conquered. You have come a very long way, all the best
🎉bravooo this is a real talent❤
He is so talented and hot and seem like a nice person just so cool of him
How do I register for Bgt
I'll be voting tonight fingers crossed my little croissant hehe x
What an amazing performance! See you in the finals! Congratulations!
I like it very much. Much love from Philippines MB14
Amazing!!!!
disuruh audisi malah konser
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR HIM TO PERFORM IN BGT
I love Simon's face when he started his act😂
Prince of persia
Surreal a energia desde cara
🎧🖤
loop station will destroy all the instruments ,like phone ended calculator “ mark my words  WELCOM TO NEW ERA
If i had to choose, i will vote for his talent. I got goosebumps ❤❤🎉🎉
4:48:  Does anyone know what he is singing here? I've heard it before in a medieval related setting.
INCREIBLEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Does the looping device have autotune or pitch control? because his voice is so amazing
Jos gandos
Absolutely amazing. Well done my dearest friend and stay blessed
Lipsing?? Real of fake
arabian trap and ncs are waiting for original mix
I pity the contestant that came after this guy ....
je suis choquée par son incapables talent !!! Trop fort Mb14 👏👏👏
I'm not really into beatbox, but this one is an exception, he really deserves a golden buzzer
I hope he wins bgt
I just heard music from movie john wick 2 😅😅😅
the sound went from like a princess having a slow-mo grand entrance to a palace coming from a distant/unknown place with her grand entourage to a car chase commercial ad...just my imagination listening to it.
Mb14 n saro wolfgang this my favorit beatbox loopstation
Mohamed Belkhir, better known as MB14, is a French beatboxer and looper.   He is a former member of the beatbox ex group Berywam.
This guy is gonna win for sure!🎉🎉
Love it <3
I never saw simon so satisfied 😅
Goosebumps talent❤
“Press that gold” - no sob story, no drama, 100% pure hard work, humility and talent. Epic performance. He’s really improved leaps and bounds since 2016 on The Voice France. Can’t wait to see his semi final performance where he displays even more of his extraordinary talent.  First time I’ve ever witnessed a performance where every single person in the audience, judges and even commentators down here on YouTube are 100% in agreement for a golden buzzer that didn’t have a negative story attached behind.  Great to see a Frenchman also with a sense of humour 🤣
The satisfaction on Simons face says it all 😊😁❤❤️‍🔥🎶
I’ve always followed beatboxing and wondered why the elite few like him haven’t done this, phenomenal performance. Simon was right to say “we should have heard of you by now”. Go make history brother.
Maybe the first Time , when i just watch many people on a tv show glad and United to having a good vibe and passed an amazing moment , real showman and talentued guys !!
😊😊👏👏👏👏👏
What's the Golden buzzer song?
After seen the short video lagend are comming here❤
He just took an art form that I despised and transformed it into something breathtakingly beautiful.  Actually, I think he just invented a whole new genre of music.  They are going to have to create a new category of Grammy just for him.
MB14 feat....jBalvin would be....Awesome......!!!
so cool seeing MB14 in this environment.
Definitely deserved that golden buzzer very impressive skills on display.
yes
Some magical thing was done by MB14, he held the audience spellbound and second magical thing was done by Ant & Dec at 6:05 ….Goosebumps….
I know nothing of it but this guy...this guy makes me love the Hindi culture!! I'm taking my girl to a Hindi restaurant just to get close to this.
Merveilleux!! Félicitations et salutations de Montréal, Canada!! 🎉😔😔
Idola pertama saat di gbb loopstation
MasyaAllah
Parece una canción de Batalla especial para la época de los Vikingos
Simply fenomenal! Come to America, you will be seen all over the 🌎
Eastern Beardyman has entered the building
He is running after fame. He has been on or applied for every show possible
7:13 Me tooo! ❤
I think his origines are Algerian
Thats GENUINE TALENT FIRST CLASS
So glad you posted as I can now thank you personally. You are so charming and so incredibly talented. I have been playing this over and over and over again. Un grand, très grand merci. Et ce n’est que le début. Bravo!
Cool
Simon >presses golden buzzer Janitor >god sake, not again
You r the best mb14 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
i have already watched it but i'm here to see peoples reactions..
O cara além de bonito, toca, canta, faz som dos instrumentos, ele é literalmente um show man.
the next person: "How do i beat that..."
Name original music?
MB14 (Muhammad): your voice is a Gift from Allah (Sub’ha’na’hu Wa Ta’a’la). Embrace it and honour it. Keep inspiring the world…Al’ham’du’lil’laah!
When talent and hard work together excellence is created. Tank you. Ceep on the good Musick!
With the name Mohammed, I wanted to hate him, but he’s so talented, good looking and sexy….. What the heck, I’m fickle……..
What a wandrful talent and what a shaning smile  He is awsom ❤
This guy right here is the reason these shows exist!!! Here’s your winner that’s my bet!

2:57 exactly ~get back to your root Mohammad
It's so good it's hard to believe it's really him doing it, amazing. Congrats
Who is the not blond women in the judge? 🤩
That was good
MB14 is so fxxx rocking crazy hardcore talented!!! And he got sooo good. I am a fan of him since that beat battle in Germany. He is one of a kind. I have always loved beat boxers, but that dude can really sing and rap, too. And that makes him so special. Wish you all the best of luck, u just deserve that!!! Rock dat beat!!! 🎉🎉🎉
0:09 ok , there is no french name is mohamad , obviously you are arab ( Algerian or Morrocoan )

I’ve never seen simpn clap
6:00 why do The scenes look so staged
Serene Gigachad
If People that bully him and read this comment and keep talk behind his back and his old school then just keep watching people blessing him in front of your face they are karma for only the people that hate them only
Then my name is going to be SR12
I was so impressed, that when he finished I clapped in my house. I CLAPPED TO A VIDEO !!
Love from Nagaland India❤
Amaaazzziiiiiinggg sound,,very unique talent,,,

I'm so happy for this man... but... Wait till they meet SO-SO
😂
The intro was insane!
he is ahead of his time i thought this kind of talent will show on 2077 cyberpunk futuristic talent omg 😱🤭
Honestly prolly good Saro didn't show up. There would have been some deaths in the crowd lmao.
Bro got guitar in his mouth
Great Bro...So Detailed
His performance is amazing. I've watched it over and over, and it never fails to move me. 🙌 I found his other beatboxing and looping performances here on yt too. Now I listen to his stuff on Spotify. He's truly an awesome artist. 👏🥹
that is talent🔥🔥🔥
The girls dancing in the crowd made me cringe so hard
Simon's brain is imploding because his experience is telling him that what he's witnessing is stupidly complex.
I've been following him since he was in berywam. He's a legend
ABSOLUTELY PHENOMENAL !!! SOOOOOO TALENTED !!! THIS audition is FAR BETTER than the OTHER great performances in the past !!! You've REALLY "stepped up your game" !!!! You DEFINITELY have OUR VOTE !!! GOOD LUCK !!!
MB14 IM ON MY MOTHERS ACC BUT U WERE AMAZINGGGG! I LITTERALLY LVE THE MUSIC JUST EVERYDAY ME LISTEN TO IT AAAH
Gilaaaa gilaaaa gilaaaaaaaaaaa
His smile is golden .
Supertalent❤
And when are we going to mention that MB14 is Megatron?  Anyway, this guy is amazing. Good job.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
SO HANDSOME❤❤❤❤❤
he deserves every bit of that golden confetti falling for him♥️ true talent
Мурашки 😮😮😮😮😮😮
MB14’s gonna eat D Low’s country. He’s a real BEAST! Really excited about the next presentations.
That is is the gift of almighty god that cannot be stolen.. Ang that is talent
Simon looks like a plastic doll. Jesus man stop whatever you're doing.
Whats the song title when golden buzzer was about to press? Thanks guys.
I’m never heard f beatbox before….this guy is amazing…a one man show for sure.
3:00 goosebumps

This dude has been apart of the beatboxing community so long! So talented!!!
HOLY SON OF A MOTHAS  THIS GUY HERE DID THAT🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉  That'll be a soundtrack
This just makes my heart happy every time I watch this.
Masya Allah,oh my God,this is so amazing and so beautiful. I'm very proud of you mb14, the name beatbox is getting better in the eyes of the world, even though I'm not a famous beatboxer but I'm already very proud to see this, thank you so much brother 😭😁🥳✊🏼✊🏼greetings from Indonesia 🇮🇩🇮🇩
4:46 when that final boss shows up💀
the sounds is like amazons tribes, i imagine in prisoner of amazon tribe and sentens of death😮
Loooooove the crowd enjoying it..... So authentic.... I wish that was the joy across the world
Simon looks on something.
amazing
omgg full poweerrrrrr number one
The art people can create brings a tear to my eye, beautiful…. Simply beautiful…..
Almost as good as beardyman
The performance was epic, but what really got me was when the 2 hosts came out and started running toward that gold. From that moment, my tears just came down flowing.
Its Islam beat but there is a vibe in the mix
I'm a new fan. I'm rooting for you bro. 😅
You deserved this years ago. Beatbox is a lost art.
BRO I NEED THAT MUSIC ON SPOTIFY RN!!!
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
I want to listen this music like hell crazy where can i get this without the audience sound??
Truly awesome MB14 . CAN'T wait to see you in the final. Mind blowing and what a winner. All the best in your journey .You deserve the crown. Jude
Woww.... Amazing......
I doubt he'll win because he hasn't got a sob story to go with the act.  He doesn't need this show to be successful.  He'll be okay
Glad that happened for MB14. One of my fave beatboxers/and Loop station guys.
Magnific❤
Awesome yaaar….it’s 2am in Bahrain…and m dancing by listening this with smile ♥️
I would love to see a collab with Michael Winslow.
He is great until he tried to rap.
That’s why look familliar that you MB14
I guess that's a jinn power
When u have great voice n mix with bbx is what u get mb14 is an professional beatboxer performed in swissbeatbox (best community thing for bbx
Simon also wanted to give him Gold Buzzer. They just stole the moment from him 😂😂😂
Magical vocals 😍 From PAKISTAN 🇵🇰❤️🇵🇰
Funny to see him outside of the Swissbeatbox battles :D
I saw you in one of the movies... semi final MB14 vs saro 2017 ✌️ congratulations on the gold button!

that long hair did something to him 🎉😮

He's MB14. What less would you expect. I'm really surprised Simon not knowing him being a music producer. Hail MB

I miss David
Merinding dan terhipnotis ajib bener
Amazing
That is Indian Veena music and he did namaste at last
Mb15 was a personil in berywam group
Ant and Dec couldn't wait for the judges to speak and The Audience tells it all,,it's an AMAZING AMAZING performance 👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿
wow he was     veryyyy   good at beat boxing, he diserved the busser
KEREN BANGETTT WOYYYYY REFLEK JATUH CINTAAA 😭❤️
We have the winner of this year's BGT unless he choke or do something weird. Can't wait to hear some more music from this guy!
Its just 10% of what he truly got .. if you really know mb14 🫢🫢
Please search Uwahig by Juvie Pelos, a philippine song which is similar rhythm and sound of this performance😮
Very very perfect.
That was truely amazing So cool...
I’ve seen performances like this before but not with nearly this many layers and a complete song at that..incredible. Literally gave me chills once the beat dropped and didn’t stop
So-So ia watching
When a YouTuber goes rampage on stage 🎉 pretty sure gansta paradise song  booming next 😁💪
Simon's jaw dropping like that shows it all
Anime fighting theme song 👌👌👌👌 sheeeeshhh
Im gonna be excited for his next performance mb14 is a goat and this only 10% of his talent.
なんかもう美しいわ
Incroyable. Vraiment. Je suis bouche bée. Absolument incroyable ❤️
I KNEW I saw him before. He was on The Voice about 7 years ago. I was so pissed to see that he didnt get picked. This was a nice way to come back for sure. Very well deserved. 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
This is the coolest thing I have ever seen in my life 😍
Talent 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
That’s scratching sound😮‍💨
Simon look like he’s on crack
Pqp
I'm super impressed. I loved everything and of course I would like to hear more music from him
This is very emotional to see
Congratulations and good luck on this amazing journey MB14!!!! Well deserved Golden Buzzer🎉🎉🎉🎉
BEST EVER AUDITION BY FAR ! ! !
We love you your talent is beyond words. Cheers from California, USA!
This is a copy of that one Ted Talk
MB14 showed like 10% of what he can do, im dissapointed he washed his usual performance down for a broader audience, cuz a sick techno drop on that aladdin beat woudve been dope
I watch this again and again just for this moment 4:54 . . . absolutely hypnotizing😵‍💫
Just short... this guy have to win it !t .... AMAZING.  NEVER SAW SOMETHING LIKE THAT ❤❤❤ LOVE IT
Woooooooo nice
I listen to it auto gawk , u gg mb14
Mind bending talent ❤😮
Mantap jiwa and mempesona 🎉🎉
Dude would be the highest paid dj of all time
Almost every time I'm listening to this it's almost impossible to stop re-watching it. 😁⭐
How many bees stung Simon's face?
Tom Thum is probably watching video saying "hey, he stole my thing."
That Islamic mediaeval tune was crazy, for the first time I felt like a cobra in a basket. Wow
To get Simon's approval like that, perfection.
MB14 here we go bro🎉
Beatbox is a great wonderful ❤❤❤
Nice enough, but still he's not Tom Thum...have been listening to him for years!
Now imagine if Saro goes there.
That is DEFINITELY talent. To be able to use those skills to create beautiful rhythms and music. His body language also add to the magic. Never heard anything remotely like it. ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT.
Really  it’s  big talent 🫂🫂❣️
I'm sorry.. he's one fine man lol
That was amazing
The only century in history so far where he can show off that talent lol
Hes actually an Arab and jot french by ethnicity. He should say his name Mohammad properly and not MB14. Weird. But hes v talented.
This show had lost everything ..its so stupid all audience voices..music at background...so silly
E un grande un fenomeno 👍🤟
This guy gets around, France, Germany and Canada, now here to take the country by storm!
He did a fantastic job ! All glory to God !!!
what a genious is this talented man sharing the beauty of his culture, all those sounds made with his voice...wow!
what a great audition, really really phenomenal 😮😃👍
I love that the song gave off ancient abandoned temple vibes.
What is his name?
My idol
Very sympatic
When did you left WWE Romen ?😂😂😂😂
He was so humble ❤
After losing to saro this man changed a lot Proud of him🎉
😍😲😲😲
MashaaAllahbro❤
the starting of the song made me go to the "Prince of Persia" Story  - He is Definitely  with no doubt the BEST  Choice for the soundtrack of a new Prince of Persia Movie/Game ...
Dude hope to see you at gbb again!
Well it's clearly an overkill there. The audience love him, the judges love him, he would certainly passed with flying colors anyway.  It's like the DnD movie scene "But we're going to approve your request."
MB14 I've watched you from Swissbeatbox to loopstation and I'm one of your fans and I'm rooting for you hardcore. Keep it up .. I'm rooting seriously
Excelente!
What a telent i love it ❤
Great 👍🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 always welcome
Goks
Thisssss amaizhinkkkkkk very very amaizhinkkkkkk🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍💓
beatbox is music... <3
Bro forgot the JBL at home…don’t worry bro he is the JBL🤩
This guy set the bar so high that when he drops the mic, you have to wait a week before it hits the ground.
Keren parah sih emang MB14👍
Wow!!!!
That's amazing man how can he do that💝💖✅
Opera in Egypt.
He turned the place to a club ♡
Wow. This must be the most beautiful beatboxing I have ever heard.
He will win. I have been watching him since few years he is phenomenal
Who’s felt like watching Gladiator movie burned wife and son, when he dropped the first sound ? ❤
hidup muhammad😍

Wonderful & awesome talent 😍
Best act in years
That's not Talent!.......that's is thousand  hours of work!!!
You're So Amazing My Friend ❤️❤️

Mantaaaaappppp🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤
Love from Bangladesh 🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🤘
That really was refreshingly incredible to hear... Nothing like it. 🎉
Im fan for mb14 for a long time ago, i see him beatbox before with mk
Goosebumps!!
Very clever choice of set this time mb , nailed it with everything personality , beats and engagement . Wait till they see what you can actually do with a loopstation 😂
MB14 is already a legend in beatboxing. 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Aladdin in Arab Nights DJing ❤
ptdr le cliche: croissant baguette mdr
Well Deserved
죽여주는구만.클라이막스부분 더 오래해주면 흥분도가니일텐데.mb14..i remember your name..
THAT DIDN'T HAVE TO GO THAT HARD 😭😭😭😭😭
Incredible!!
if this gorgeously talented man wasnt already a narcicist this love in the comment section will make him one.
The look on simon's face, looks like it's the best audition he's ever seen.!
Wow amazing watching from philippines pure talent keep it up man👊🔥 you deserve this
I used to b good at beatboxin    man,but WOW.BIG UP BRO

Can I ask for the name of the soundtrack at the end, does anyone know?
I like him, so awesome 😍
Talent 🎉
One of the legends of beatbox that has always done a lot for the community and spreading it to others 🙌
That was insane!!!!!! ❤❤❤
I'm not into beatboxing, but that was an interesting act.
I think mb14 paid to came this show.because he's already a celebrity.hes famous since long time... Btw this track name is pyramid.u can find hes video in youtube.
M'hammed, je regarde en boucle ta performance en 2018 à La Cup sous le regard de gens qui réagissent (la plupart étasuniens) et je m'éclate !  En 1/2, tu les accroches avec un petit Gangsta paradise (ils ne t'ont pas encore entendu rapper et Alicia va adorer) et tu les cloues en lâchant la gomme en finale.  Là, c'était trop court.
Glory is MB14!!!
Wow amazing
I hate the audience clapping!!
This is talent 100%
HyperHumbleGuy
Editing still terrible after decades of this show.
What is the real title of his beatbox song, wow, it's very good, thank you ♡♡♡
Wtf happened to Simon's face!?
Assalamu'alaikum mb14  ure the bestt my friend . keep going  Asalamualaikum warachmatullahi wabarokatuh . piece to you all ❣️❣️❣️❣️
Bruh this stupid audience..stfu nd let us listen to this legend
I really wonder what the feeling is when a golden buzzer is pushed on someone. Like that must be a feeling only dreams are made of
Go cut your hair. That's nasty
I'am so sad look mb14 win gold Ticket .I am very sad to see the struggle of mb14 from the beginning until now🎉🎉
Muhammad, our Brother!
Woooooow, i never see that before
i am proud of u muhammad, you are very talented 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Holy crap. Speechless
He's reincarnated Jesus
Saro makes better music though.
Esh! Absolute legend, amazing to see him come from beatboxing to where he is now!
dammmm he a just so cooooll
Well done MB14 😁 This guy is incredible and will go far in the competition if BGT doesn't hold him back and gives him creative freedom.🤔 Bravo MB14 😁 Ce mec est incroyable et ira loin dans la compétition si BGT ne le retient pas et lui laisse la liberté de création.🤔
How to hypnotize Simon in 5 seconds = 4:48
The cinematography of this was really impressive lol. Fitting for his performance
He is amazing, talented yes, but seems to be such a decent man. I do hope he goes FAR
Do yourself a favor and go watch his complete performance…simply amazing!
Holy freaking WOW just WOW bro!! Absolutely amazing!!! Keep killing it MB14 I wish you the best of luck man!!! Officially a fan! 🤘
Hasta me dió escalofrío , que padrisimo
That should be a lound and ant and deck press the golden buzzer when Steven done it he got told off by Simon Cowell and didn’t expect it
3:23 give that man a lollipop 🤷
MB14 turkiyeden selam,tüm müsülman kardeşlerime
Allah selalu bersamamu kawan🎉
This is awesome we need Dlow up there
The look on Simon's face lol
Winner!!!
It been a while I see pure talent since Tokyo Meyer. Same vibes
4:48. When u enter the boss room at the last dungeon’s floor
Jonás Gutiérrez finally found a new path after been a legend at Newcastle
I’ve grown up watching this guy pure skills
Светлого пути в жизни 😊
Bravo mohamed ❤
Simon's face - priceless!!!
What song is playing in the background when you get the lgolden buzzer?
Whats the song use in the background..
i love your audition so so so much realy you are a legend man  go a head
Bravo Mohamed! Faut aller au bout! La voix aigu est incroyable, jouer avec ça pour la suite, quelque chose de bien émotif, ça me rappelle la musique de Dune. Joue sur ça!!
Thats the winner for this year..
I love your talent. But don't lie. You're not French. You're either Moroccan, Algerian, or Tunisian.
Well this was a s surprise because I usually dislike beatbox. Yes it can be hard but also annoying to listen to when I go to the west end and I’m forced to listen. This was incredible and he is talented. He is not a copy cat but actually put thought into changing things.I’m not surprised he well none in France. He is exceptionally talented and it shows he has spent years mastering this talent.   On a separate note I’m not sure what cowelle is eating or doing to his face but he looks like he’s aged about twenty years
Alguém sabe nome da música. Final que toca pôr favor ?
Woooooow . Impresionante, saludos desde Argentina.
Bu adam saf yetenek 😂
Well deserved GOLDEN BUZZER!
💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗
Awesome! Epic! Thee Best! ❤️
Well deserved 😂😅
WOW that was..... (Lost for words) Well-deserved golden buzzer!
Bout time this guy was noticed. He is sick
That is the best thing I have ever seen wtf
WOW
SEI UN TALENTO PURO
Roman Reigns beatboxing 😅
Ant and Deck can to vote? I don't knew!
Jesus Christ , Those sounds take you to another world. Back in time 🥹🫡🫡🫡
As much as I thought this was amazing, it still puzzles me that this show is called Britain's Got Talent, when it should be really be called Britain's Got Talented Visitors. I'm starting to feel that those who keep traveling to other countries just to do these shows should be banned. They don't belong to us so why is the name of the show claiming that they do lol?
People who is watching him for the first don't know this guy is a good singer as well he was the winner of THE VOICE FRANCE.
Desde las batallas de beatbox hace años, siempre era muy destacable pero aumento considerablemente esas skills
The best  talent💯
the guy killed it...
I agree with Simon, AGT jury is much more inteligent 🤦‍♂️
Awesome
That is insane. I’ve didn’t know that was possible 😳
Not only is he a master of his craft -pure genius- he is so beautiful inside and out, his personality is so sweet and kind.
Never die one detection still using there songs ❤❤❤
WOW!!! freaking awesome!!! Way better than all that other beatbox crap.
pure talent. I can’t stop watching this.
It's more than a golden buzzer. I heard millions of beatboxer but u are the best of them all. Thank you for showing your talent. I never idolized someone the way I idolize you.
Dude I am speechless.
Golden buzzer without sad story and drama ....applause!!! Good joB muhammad❤
They should go listen to CGT there's a woman on there that did the same kind of thing, she's amazing🇨🇦 love this guy to!!
Кинул он в итоге русскую чернильницу))))
Dj khaled Need This guy

I love to watch pure talent like this.
But there are some who can 🤔 still a talent that pays off
@14 you are purely talented glad you show up in the BGT,hopefully will keep on moving high up..Amiin
Beautiful 👏👏👏💐
When your mother isn't proud anymore because she already mastered her proud level this happen
very high expesive voice
Saro is way better than mb14
Hope to Saro here someday
The worst thing about these talent shows: the goddamn noisy audience.
❤❤❤
Wonderful！Amazing！
anyone of a G beatboxers would get a golden buzzer, they so much ahead of any bgt talent, no offense 😊
Well done Muhamad
He is amazing❤
Its good
W o W  Amazing talent
Magnifique 🎉🎉🎉💯💯✅️💯🔥🔥🔥
I am just imagining Tom cruise in mission impossible with this background music in a chase scene
Judges with no talent at all judging a show full of talented candidates. 😅😂
Fun fact: He used to be the leader of berywam
What is the device on the table for?
you should team up with the arab girls who did that single line dance... the  Mayyas
Song name
Marvelous
Nice fake na wo sind die sound boxen versteckt
So humble and talented, what an incredible mixture.
Thalent and handsome
One of my favorit beatboxer 🥺👍🏼
Goosebumps! Well done bro. 😎😎
You deserved it
I love his voice as well ❤️ 🇫🇷 🇫🇷 🇫🇷
He wasn't performing ... he was just enjoying himself making sound that came naturally ...
Today i feel Arabian
Minute 4:58 its so beutiful
This what call it talent
Ur omg
This was just a small sample of this track and it made everyone super wet😂.
I saw him for the first time in The Voice France 2016 😃 and I was amazed at his talent, I am surprised at how far he has come and how much he has improved 😭💐💖
“Ma sha All llah" 👏👏👏🤗🤗🤗💛💛💛  Love u From Albania ♥️🇦🇱
الي يشوف تعليقي يحط لايك

Nụ cười đẹp thật sự
He can make music for movies. I imagine this track in Indiana Jones on the Human sacrifice scenes... Just Amazing

Bro doesn't spit Music, Music spit bro 💀
Sam Perry doing similar music, this guy was increddible too
Awersome audition...
Tidak pernah bosan melihat vidio anda,sungguh luar biasa....

His performance was literally stunning. Simon and everyone else were simple in awe. Well done and congrats!
Love his beautiful smile❤
civciv cikacak kus cikacak... :)
Akhirnya MB14 disini dan dia buat sejarah. Selamat kawan. 👏
Yeah that wasn't scripted from the rehearsals they knew before the video taping, right
He’s a professional beatboxer. He’s been doing shows professionally for at least 5 years. There’s videos of him. It’s kinda like if a celebrity signed up for BGT and won everyone over lol it’s inevitable
Imagine Eminem rapping to this😂😮
❤❤❤❤❤❤
🎉🎉🎉
Awesome 🎉
Never heard anything like this before, too good
MB14 🔥🔥❣️
The girls with white shirt its beautiful btway..😂😂😂
Most viewers
Wow
This is awesome!!! rooting for you MB14
Bruh i was so shocked when i saw him on Got Talent, man will finally get the attention he deserves 😅
Is this on Spotify?
This man is the total package. Incredible talent, amazing voice, great personality, beautiful hair and smokin' hot!
That's what we call talent
Mb14 my bro, Best BeatBox
His look like a gigachad😂
Simon looks like crap. Probably lack of adrenochrome
🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶
Originel audition.Vous êtes vraiment unique en votre genre Mohammed.
Omg! This is the craziest act I have ever watched on BGT
❤🎉😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
Everything goes mellow for a while and when the beat dropps at 4:55  🤯
I continue saying it, Simon Cowell has broken through everything that holds people back, he is a superstar for giving people of "lowly" backgrounds to Inspire,God bless him
I would listen to him over any DJ in the world. Amazing talent. I hope he win.
Bravo
thats my dude
MB14 is going to smash the competition! Hands down, they not ready! He deserves already to win it all. GOOD LUCK MB14! YOU GOTS THIS MANE!
He won in France 3 years ago and he was in radio performing so many times I don't know why he goes in UK 😮
Tom Thum is the OG at this.
Subhan Allah you carry a great name
This year is full of pure talent
Zidane of music!!!! Incredible
He's already famous its crazy
Sorry guys, but, that is entertaining, look, he don't even surprised/surprises,    (My english is s*cks)
Hip Hip took over the world.
Music factory 😍
What's the name of this song though
I'm just seeing this.  I won't have much time for prime time TV but I wish you all the best and will be looking forward to watching more of you on YouTube!  Just phenomenal!
I've been a beatbox fan all my life, I really like the guy from Australia got talent too he goes by Genesis. He was amazing, but MB14 just took the beatbox to another level.
OMFGG
Making that kind of music without any instruments is just pure magic !
Good Job Muhammad
im so happy for this guy , his face was shining!!! congratulations 🎉
Do gangster paradise
He had used his 1% of the talent.He is much ahead of what he revealed in the audition😍❤️
Akhirnya mb14 di got talent.. 🤟

Goosbumbs..... 👌🏼
Simon looks like the monster from Loch Ness
MB 14 Meraviglioso

It was like Arab music meets with Western Music...wow..another level.
Pov:How many times you've watched it?? Me:Yesss
Curious though why he didn't say his name is mohammed to the judges as he mentioned in the intro 🤔
Pure talent and pure humility pure heart pure humanity...
Masha Allah🖤
👋 Assalamualaikum Muhammad 😆

HOW?!!!!!
Did you know guys MB14 was former part of BERYWAM
❤
aim like you ... you Coll...❤❤😊👍👍👏👏
Ambil lagu akhir
❤❤😂
It was the opera vocals that shocked me 😯
Это очень круто. Я бы слушал его вечер. Крутой чувак. Музыка огонь
Sem peri australia did this 8years ago for the frst time and its more better sorry but he is Da vinci 😂
The dude is awesome. At least he did it. I learned to do same, as a kid, but just didn't see myself good enough..Great for him, made me happy for him!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉 To him that goes forward, without looking back, sees victory!!😎😎😎
His personality and his talent were a match made in heaven.. What a charming guy❤ No need to mention the obvious, what a contagious smile❤
His aura is oozing with brilliance! I love him.
Imagine an entire album of his music!
Should watch GGB
WHATS THE SONG OF TWHEN HE GETS GOLD BUZED?
Well done, MB14!!! Amazing audition, couldn't be happier to have you representing the beatbox community on such a large stage!!! 👏👏👏
MB14 nomber 1
I want it in my playlist
4:28-4:38 That is insanely impressive
❤
WOW....Incredible, just outstanding ... well done bud !
I knew Jesus can do it😊
Like to see him go head to head with another beat boxer called FROSTY 🎉🎉🎉🎉😮😮😮
I really pray you win 🎉 You are fantastic with amazing personality and performance   Mohammed  So proud of you 👏   الله يسعدك ويوفقك ونشوفك احسن واحد في العااالم شخصيتك تجنن وميوزكك 😅 تاخذ العقل وشعرك حلو 😊   تعال الرياض بليز ❤❤❤
We love ant &deck
No sob story, just pure world class talent!!!
Congratulations iam very happy to you from Egypt ❤❤❤❤❤
Better call x -men
yes is the besttttt❤
He really deserves a golden buzzer. And it's called God's gifted.
I think BGT is more about propelling his popularity or else the name's already in the beatboxing industry for quite some time now.
MB14 is one of the best beatboxers out of many other talented beatboxers.
Why did he chicken out about his name? He said Mohammad in the beginning. He should be proud having that name no matter where you are. Very talented.
I want david williams back !
😮😮😮😮
4:45 is all about MB14, look even it Simon Cowel's impression! his soul was listening not only his body.  Three Mohammeds who changed the world: 1- Profet Mohammed for the wonderful peaceful religion Islam, he was humble, fun, wise, smart, strong, real handsom kind man.💖💖💖💖🌹🌹  2- In wrestling, we had Mohammed Ali, the best in wrestling and humble personality strong kind man very charismatic look and style💖💖  3- In beatboxing, now we have Mohammed (MB14)💖💖
i think her majesty i mean his majesty is gonna love this😂😂😂
I can't leave this video😮😮
I hope he wins BGT ❤
WOW you are stunning amazing! You deserve it man! Greetings from Germany.
I didnt think people actually lived in the u.k
💙-={  اللهم صل علي سيدنا محمد  }=-💙
Youtube shorts brought me here!
To było niesamowite 🙏👍😀
Muhammad❤
I saw a clip off this on YouTube shorts, so I decided to type in the full clip, I am a stunned! Absolute pure talent well done!! Gave me goosebumps, you defo deserved that golden buzzer WELL DONE
Pure Talent
Bro that was awesome....I love everything of it bro...by the way you looking like ROMAN REGINS in few angles 😊
Awesome!!!
Yes, MB14 is the most talented beatboxer. Nice very exited tune
Simon : MORE MONEY FOR MEEEE
Чувак с фильма Тенор
Stunning performance 👏 Wished that he uses his real name, no need a nickname
is this assassin creeds or smth
Beatbox and loopstation community going wild🥳
Ouaah your performance so amazing !! You really have a gift 🙏🏻.  I saw you the first time in the movie "Tenor" and I liked so much your performance, your interpretation in it, and not only you but the rest of the cast also of course.  I wish you all the best in this competition and of course even after that.  Take care ☺️🙏🏻
John Travolta? ❤❤❤😅😅😅😅
That was beautiful… he can do a good 4 minutes during a main set in the clubs
Him and the guy from police academy  need to do something together it will be awesome
I need this mp3 version!!!
He was like performing Magic.. All black.. Magical!!
Now we just need a collab with MB14 and Sickick!! ❤❤🌟🌟
Well, MB14 is the former? member of BERYWAM. You know the beatbox group in AGT. He's the M in BERYWAM. But idk if he's still member or not.
Golden Buzzer Talented ❤🌟🌟❤
Milkha Singh?
le boss.
If I ever hear bro in the club I’m getting naked ☠️
4:53 wow
Me listening to this while brushing and gargling.. lol
Some body knows the name of that instrument that he use to record his voice ?
I knew even if there are many others that can do what he did, but I think the Pyramids really fits BGT niche
Legend 🔥🔥
Simplesmente fantástico!
I was amazed by him 7years ago
Dude's the main character
First things first, he is brilliant. Very talented and he deserves a stage to share his incredible talent.   But most importantly and secondly, STOP THE FOREIGN ACTS!! ITS CALLED BRITAIN GOTS TALENT NOT EARTHS GOT TALENT.  It’s about British talent.
God of Sounds ❤❤ ...
he ate an instrument
I got goosebumps 🔥🔥🔥
This is just out of this world!!!! LOVE IT
Performance of the decade ❤❤❤
Raw and original, love it
Winner 2023.🎉🎉
His battle with Saro six years ago is the reason we are able to see his much polished version. The loopstation battle with Saro revealed a completely different side of him. Everything happens for a reason. If he had won the battle with Saro, we would never have been able to see this side of him. Saro and MB14 are the true best beatboxing musicians for me.
OMG Thls is fantastic 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Really dope, he deserve it.
Watafak this guy make me envy
Sympathischer Dude . Sound 😱👌
Very talented, but also take afrer to SAM PERRY
After watching this video MB14 and Tom Thumb are two of my favorite beat boxers
I could watch this over and over again.. How can he be so masculinwith winging so femi in?.. Wow.. And his soul just looks happy all the time.. Defenetely worth winning
thank you mohammed❤
Wow

Ohh yes, Mb14 is one of the best !!!!!!!!
Wow ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

Very well deserving Golden Buzzer! What a handsome, humble, super talented guy with gorgeous hair and great smile (when he smiles, he reminded me of John Travolta)
If Saro was there he would of smashed mb14. Saro has beaten him 4x. Mb14 is not even in Saro league
Amazing 😍😍
AMAZING, EMOTIONAL, PURE TALENT... And gorgeous! :-)
It’s funny that this is an even bigger stage for him than having the honour to be a judge for gbb 😂
Seorang pria yang rendah hati penuh senyum yang menawan dan bakat yang luar biasa❤❤❤
This guy has such a talent he needs to be heard worldwide  10 out of 10 man amazing work
I'm really happy for him. He's the reason I was interested into beatboxing.

Amazing ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
this is my 20 times of watching this video..  big hugg from Timor-Leste My brother..  the best of MB14
His skills have improved a lot since his last audition in thé voice FR
Amazing performance... Like it
why is the judge in red dancing like a stripper 😂
Love you man , and like your performance
I swear if he doesn’t win-
Out of 5.7m views, 1m must be mine. xD
Wow
Wow so nice❤
Bravo MB14, bravo. Hopefully we will see you in finals. Congratulations. And one more thing, why all Bruno wants is to take his clothes off. Chill Bruno, chill. He did the same thing with the ghetto kids from Uganda.
Not only he is talented, he is soooooo humble.
Me : shazam? Whats that music? Shazam : just keep playing. 🕺💃🤸‍♂️
A little weird, yet catchy...one 2 watch.
Wowow he deserves to win it all! Rooting for you MB14
You were awesome,phenomenal
Pyramid❤
I'm sorry, but I just don't see all the grandeur.  What he did has been done many times on many talent shows.  I just don't see the grandeur!
He was with the group Berywam! He’s one of the best if not the best! Hope he wins
😊
تلقاه مغربي الأصل 😂😂😂
this part 4:49 OMFG
Subhanallah
ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE, IT RAISED MY SPIRITUAL VIBRATION TO A NEW LEVEL,...........
I saw this video 100 times and I feel like I'm watching for the first time This man is genius ❤
Por favor no dejen entrar más a Simon a un sitio con botox jajajajajajsjs
ESH! ❤
4:54 The gesture adds so much to the already incredible drop imo. Mb14 is a true showman.
the king of loopstation is back 🔥🔥🔥
That was well and truly deserved. He's amazing. I love what ant said to him after. And I love that he didn't win because of a sob story. That was well deserved. Pure talent.
just wow
Best performance in BGT
😂ant and deck he doesn't deserve a golden buzzer 😮
😊😊
Mrk akan menjatuhkan asia
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
4:19 The moment he added the bass 🔥🔥
And thats what we called human talent.. that was really great.🎉🎉🎉
He should have 34,000 golden buzzers
It just a masterpiece ☝️
good ant and dec got theirs
keren banget ❤❤
محمد بلخير من أصل جزائري فرنسي مقيم بفرنسا ❤❤❤
I LOVE THIS SO MUCH CANT STOP WATCHING!!!
لقد حضرته للمرة الألف 😭
Usually not a fan of Looping, but mb12 is just something else
Yoo mb12
That's the French touch :)
Amazing talent. Not just a beatboxer, but he has a phenomenal voice, can sing, can rap, can DJ, can compose music, all that with a looper. I am just learning all these things because of him. And he is so humble. Better than other beatboxers I can find on the internet even those who seem more successful. This guy is an artist, so humble and so handsome. I really hope he can become an international star. If a DJ can be so successful, an artist like him who is way more should succeed even more. I hope he can bring some singing into his next act.
I think he is Egyptian
THAT GUY HAS SOME GREAT NERVES TO NOT BREAKDOWN, WHEN THE GOLDEN BUZZER WAS PRESSED...
what the backgroun music name?
what the backgroun music name?
what the backgroun music name?

This is pro talent
I'm so in love with the music as well as the girl on WHITE SHIRT <3
If he doesn’t win idk who will
Can someone tell me what was the gadget used to lock down the beatbox and sounds and where can i find it
Did anyone noticed that Bruno looks exactly like Pagan Min from the game FARCRY 4 😂
Woohoooo finally mb14 is on bgt!
That's the talent termenders performing 😳😳 o my goddess ...
Amazing wow wow wow
FYI he is a former member of BERYWAM (The M in the BERYWAM is him)
When you are so good that you floored the judges and they can't give you a standing ovation. 5:33 Simon 😂
Am I the only one that have listened this x100 and still counting ¿?
His smile makes everything better
Wow, just wow  i dont know how to talk
Xem đi xem lại vẫn thấy hay
THE "M" FROM BERYWAM
...Forgot to count how many times I watched this audition so far! Absolutely fantastic! Very well done, Mohammad. ❤️💙💚💛💜🧡🤎❤️💙💚💛
Mb14 fans assemble ❤️
I’m in love
Goosebumps 😱😱 My Golly, Pure Talent and Skills 🤍🥰 You're going to make it brother! Continue the Passion !

ما شاء الله
Absolutely amazing 🎉🎉🎉🎉 congratulations
No way .. all love from Egypt ❤
The beat boxing crew from AgT was from France as well? Found a common theme 😂I think
MB14!!!!!! LET'S GOO
Se ele tivesse usado esse som na batalha contra Saro teria vencido com uma larga vantagem. Enfim, tudo tem sua hora.
Simply incredible. Such a magnificent musical genius.
Hey it’s a freee lambo though
Ant and Decs golden buzzer will probably win this year
His wife/gf is so lucky, he can do multiple things with his mouth
I love his Man Bun you are so talented couldn’t agree more with the GOLDEN BUZZER❤❤
FRANCE !! 💪 Soyons fiers !! Ps : Petite larme à l'œil !!
The show was more than wonderful, creative, and I wish it every success🤍
I have watched this like 28 times since uploaded 😍😘
C'est ça notre France ! ❤🇫🇷
I couldn't here you on the stream and the chat wasn't working😢
My favorit betbox ❤
omg he mix all jnra
Pathetic.All done for tv.Those two clowns in the wings have no talent unlike those performing.The panel pretend to be gobsmacked when they know the camara is on them.
I've seen you in other competitions you finally got a deserved recognition and I've known you for a long time you've always liked me...bravo
The God 🔥💥💪
Wooow im speachless
Como se llama??
I'm a singer from France 😂 on a show called Britain's got talent, imagine just sending Adele to perform on agt as a contestant lmao they do France has talent wtf is this, if your into beatboxing you know there's some monsters that would rip this dude apart
He has god gifted voice & no doubt 💯 percent talent💫
You are an Eminem, a Pavarotti, a David Guetta and more altogether... What I like most about you is your ability to combine all those great people' styles into one: Yours! Keep it up and hit big like the dreamer you are to make us dream in turn!!! You are just a champion like the beatbox  world champion you have been!!!
What a lovable smile he got and also we can clearly see and feel his happiness in his eyes❤❤tats a great vibe🎉
BEATBOX IS MAGIC GO WIN FOR COMMUNITY❤️❤️❤️❤️
My EARS and EYES are blown away!! ❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤
Pyramid 😍❤️
MB14 We support you and shout out to BBK and all Beatbox community ❤️
Amazing
Is that really him? is that still him? What rock do these celebrities live undercover, to find beatboxing a new thing?..  Killa Kella, Beardy man, Eclise, etc.. were performing with loop decks at festivals for years.
He’s so unbelievable he had to make all of the noises at the beginning so we’d know it was really him later in the performance 😭💛
best moment of mb14, and still you are always amazing...
Dude that was just insane cheers dude from Sydney Australia ❤
Esse cara é de Marte! Kkk que talento é esse? Amazing!
When you’re in a group project but have to do it all by yourself
he is so cute!!!
I remember seeing this guy's clip from the voice in France before, so cool to see him on another show
yesss MB14!!! wooo!
Moh I hope you win ❤
as always, 2 weeks i watching this 10+ times... bravo our kings❤️
The Got Talent stage is the place to be to become internationally noticed, period. From this performance he instantly captured the audience from all over the USA and UK!
What a stunningly talented and handsome man, the world needs him on stage!!!
Simon is just flipping out 😂
2:52
I hope MB14 will make a good surprise by performing with his former band.
Fun fact this guy was apart of Berywam the beatboxing group

I think it was a just a normal performance
Outstanding virtuoso and artist. A real diamond!

This will be BGT's anthem for maaaaaany years to come.
Pure talent 🎉🎉🎉

4:48  sephiroth coming down from the sky

Cocorico

Totally fire 🔥
Fire 🔥
I m in love!😍 Great performance!
MB14 beatbox king ❤
He is truly remarkable! It has been quite some time since I last seen him on The Voice. I must say, he has made remarkable strides in his artistic journey. His vocal range has expanded beautifully, and the manner in which MB14 gazes at the other gentlemen while striking that chord at 3:05 never fails to send shivers down my spine. It's as if his eyes convey a message to them, saying, "Behold, my dear, witness this astounding performance I am about to deliver."
Let’s take a moment here at 1:45 the way Amanda was looking at MB14… 😏 A woman who knows what she likes…
I have faith that he's gonna win this year's BGT. The most incredible entertainer, looper, beatboxer and an individual talent of 2023!
"THAT IS TALENT!"
❤❤❤🥰🥰🥰🥰 he's winer for me
Really talent
I find the judge that replaced David so dead 🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️
Its unexpected i watch 100s auditions but this one is amazing and top of all
The winner is here 🎉
Growing up with a passion for beatboxing, it's crazy how many talented people you come across. When I first stumbled upon gbbb's on YouTube, mb14 was one to shine and stand out to me with his unique music style. For real he is a musician and is one of my top 5 favourite beatboxers still to this day. So happy to see him on bgt! 💯
Love you guys ❤️
This man take the beatbox to a whole new level that's crazy
You're arabic "Mohamed" not french
MB14 just put beat box on the world stage
I like his smile 💙💙
How do I vote for him?
Bravo. C'est bien mérité. Quel talent. Il aurait dû gagner The Voice. C'est ça être La Voix 😁 j'ai toujours pas digéré pourquoi il a pas eu cette  reconnaissance.
MB14 smile 😳😳
Sensacional
So entertaining. Sangat menghibur..  You're not from this planet🎉❤
I've literally seen this video for like a 100 times and i still do not get bored of this... Hats off to mb14.
4:50 goosebumps!!!!
Stop fooling viewers , you bring somebody who is already famous as if he is a new talent 😂😂

Goosebumps! I have been watching it over & over again. Incredible talent!
😲😲😲😲😲😲
Woow.. I didn't know how many time I just watched. It was Amazing.
MB 14  Zidane of Music ❤❤
I must have watched this 20 times, its just incredible, by far the best BGT audition i have ever seen.
After Beatbox Joseph, it's MB14 that made me love beatbox. Now he's doing his solo career after Berywam and after a quite long pause but I'm glad seeing him again
Это крутотень охрененная!!❤
for those of us who are into beatbox, mb14 has been already a legend for quite long time. a very well  deserved victory my friend 😊
What a talent. I'd really love to see him in a collab with Reinhardt Buhr, who is doing the same looping method to create amazing music with instruments
Thoppi 🏃‍♂️
CAN ANYONE TELL ME NAME OF INTRO MUSIC AT BACKGROUND PLEASE?
collab saro n mb14
he is my favorit contestan on BGT
5th élément  Multipass my friend

loud crowd while looping live must be a pain
There are not enough superlatives to describe just how good this is. Nuff said 🤜🏻🤛🏻
And sanam puri too 😂
He look like Roman reigns
Guys you need to watch the Full Version of this song of him!
It always touches my heart when I see a beatboxer I've wqtched for years make it in the bigger stages and show the world what beatboxing is as an art form😊
♥️♥️♥️
❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉
Can YouTube block me from watching this video, I have probably watched it like thousand times already I'm tired.😂🤣😭
What’s 😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊a great improvement’s  😊😊😊😊😊
His smile🥹
He's a lot like Australia"s Sam Perry, the Voice! Amazing!! cheers
Smiling is the way to happiness
I never watched any video twice of BGT...but bro i catch you thrice.

This alien🙏🙏
judges: is he really doing that? the instrument that is changing his pitch and tone:
TIME
He should get hired at all Vegas Clubs.   Unbelievable talent.    Have you guys seen movie called perfume at the end?   Crowds will fall in love with this guy.
En commençant par ''the voice '' et passant par le film ''tenor'' et maintenant 'Britain's got Talent'' (golden buzzer) , profond RESPECT à toi MB14  Bonne continuation pour la suite 🤙😉❤️🙏
Amazing..
Pretty sure 90% is backround music and autotune
King beatboxer 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
La référence parfaite à notre baguette 🥖 et nos croissants 🥐 🇫🇷❤️
Rooting for him since he was in GBB
I thought Bruno was going to hit the Golden Buzzer before MB14 even performed! (And who coulda blamed him?!)
His voice is phenomenal also
He is the French version of Canadian Darcy Oak from BGT 2014! Great charisma, stage presence, unique talent, gob-smacked reactions from the judges and the crowd. (05:30 is where he looks the most like Darcy)
2:45 to listen to it again😂😂 You’re welcome🙌🏾
Супер!
Woow you're amazing😍🤩😍🤩 Looking forward to see the next program, wish you win 🥳💪🏼🤩
Please MB14 make a soundtrack out of It 😭😭😭
Fenomenaly!!!!
They have no idea what kind of force they’re dealing with! MB14 is a great representation for the beatbox community and he will bring beatbox into the mainstream! We are proud of you MB! Give it all! 🎉🎉🎉

Bro's just farming the tv show wins by now
Anyone knows the song when he got the golden buzzer?
I'm obsessed!
Un véritable prodige, son talent est incontestable. Félicitations et merci à vous. 😘
This man very famous in france since 2016... I know this man in youtube 2016... He is real name Muhammad A.K.A. MB14
I now him from Voice of France 🥰
Winner of the voice france its so funny the people are not unknown
MARADONA MESSI MB14
So good congrats. I hope other loopstation beatboxers also have to try performing, It is so nice to hear everyone's musics by their mouth.
So happy the world outside of the beatbox community and outside of France finally gets to discover MB14, a true legend and beatbox world champion when he was part of BERYWAM (who crushed AGT after he left the group). So very well deserved. He can do much more than this performance, can't wait for the next stages!
he only used 5% of his power
Esh?
The girl who said "He has great hair" is my girlfriend. That day she fought with me and went out to watch BGT auditions with her friends 😒
Betcha!!!!!!! This is freaking awesome and beautiful..mate your cool
Who knows the last song at the end
He was with Berywam previously ! I saw him many times before... always awesome 🤩
To those of you who didnt know....the M in BeRyWaM actually stood for MB14 Be- Beatness Ry- Rythmind Wa- Wawawad M- MB14
MB14 your performance gives me goosebumps, that i can't help myself  repeating on watching your performance. Well deserve!
Wheew! I feel like dancing while im lying in my bed.
u got top 8 in GBB 2019...
MB14 that should be my new phone ringtone that pure talent
T'as tellement géré ! En plus de ton talent qu'on connait déjà bien en france, il y a tout le travail de chant que tu as fais ces dernières années et aussi les bonnes vibs que tu amènes avec toi partout ou tu passes ! Pour moi, tu es humainement une personne qui mérite d'être dans la lumière des projecteurs ! GG BRO
This Is The Legend Bro
Ant and Dec always press the golden buzzer for the most amazing acts, well done MB14! That was amazing.
A minute 4:48 is the experience of 15 or 20  years of hard work ❤❤ The greatest performance in the history of the britch got talent 👏👏❤
Isso realmente foi incrível ❤️

Is that James Arthur in the crowd? Good to see him.  Big ups to this guy. Mad Talent
mb14 one of my favorite beatboxers since I was a teenager and I am very moved

I can look this Video so many times. I liked you in The Voice France and now I hope you gonna win this show . You deserve it
Now let's invite Saro 🔥
Une voix magnifique, un talent hors norme de musicien et un beatboxer génial : il a tout et, cerise sur le gateau, une humilité qui fait du bien. BRAVO MB14
mohamed belkhir
It will become a rule: If you are French and you show up at Britain Got Talent or America got Talent, then you have to be memorable (in a good way). Marc Métral, Léa Kyle, French Twins ...
this is not music
Amazing talent ! Your career just took off! Congratulation. 👍
He's a big star Amazing voice and a big talent mb14 🎉

Chills all over! The beginning of his performance though, WOW!! 🥶🥶🥶 oh my word he is AMAZING!! a definate contender to win! 🤩🤩❤❤❤❤🤩🤩🤩
この2人にもボタン押す権利与えた人天才
On his own he's a great singer but add the beatbox and the loopstation. it goes onto another level 💥
Fun fact:  MB14 was actually a member of Berywam, but left the group to pursue his solo career
phenomenon
Of course he's going to win, MB14 is Grand Beatbox Battles (Gbb) world champion already, the tracks he's using he's been perfecting since at least 2015, he's already god in the Beatbox world, lol, he is amazing.
Where are you Vakhtang
Damm you good
bravo men 💥👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Mb 14(Mohammed) is a music genius
That was amazing!
cghj
This show should've died 10 years ago...
Plot twist:  X-rays revealed an entire sitar, and seven people in his stomach.
Damn, but that was strait up amazing.  I could listen to that over and over.
Damn.. So glad to see him after years, he looks so much different and polished. Him and Tom thum are both my favorites.
Mashallah ✊🏾

Croissant, Baguet
man used only 10% of his power. Imagine if he did the whole song. They would probably have to innovate a new buzzer for him.

Does anyone know what he said at 2:10 I couldn’t understand why he came to the show. Sorry I’m American☹️
Holy... that was level GOD!!!
Goosebumps 🔥

Fantastic 😮❤
🖤
its so emotional how someone can go from ordinary to superstar..this is one perfomance on got talent i will never forget. mohammed will rise to stardome in no time
Wait... Willams gets bounced for some comments but .... BRUNO??? What the effing F. Bruno is a friggen predator and a really really creepy guy. David got bounced for this creep? Great performance and one I will not soon forget. So terrible that it, for me, was over shadowed by Creepy Bruno.
Music in the last pls?
🔥🔥🔥🔥 One of the best beatbox I've heard in a very long time
The goat beatboxing
MB14 crazy vocalist and beatboxer
He had a very pure and warm eyes n smile
ESH!!!!!
Mb14 i love it ❤ beatboxer Francis 👏
I love this man. ♥
Music please 😊
He's my favorite!!!
Watching his sheer talent aside the smiles on EVERYONE'S faces makes this worth watching again and again.
Absolute chills.
MB14 LEGEND 😊😊
What is the song title of the backsound?
mb14 gonna be crazy this year.
I’m his fan since he was in Berywam Beatbox team ❤
Ils n'ont pas voulu de lui à The Voice. Je n'ai plus regardé après sa saison, j'avais trouvé son élimination dégueulasse. Allez Mb14, fais leur regretter de ne pas t'avoir gardé, et fais nous un hold-up ! 😎
Il est just incoiyable...
Not only is MB14 talented, this man is genuinely a humble man. You can see he isn't full of ego but rather humour and authenticity
Deserve a GB
BGT this year has the most amazing acts, talent, and showcase of humanity !!!!
nan mais incroyable , vraiment  même la musique sur les ralentie incroyable , ce mec est juste incroyable ❤
What a talent!! Congrats for the win. This man looks a alike Bad Bunny haha.
MB14 is known in France by initiates, but it deserves to be recognized worldwide. Well done Mohammad!
O alok tá diferente...
Pov: Video games once you enter the desert
MB 14 un vrai talent ,un bosseur qui reste attaché à son rêve
Mohamed Belkhiri . Just another north african showing the world the pure talent
Man’s gonna win no doubt 🎉
The look on Simon Cowell says everything
5:23 I think he's telling the audience to wait bc he hasn't finished yet but they kept clapping and shouting so he couldn't do the last part lol
Game changer
These judges have the most npc reactions
Man has Something 😌
Brilliant he is 👏🔥
Ahh my idol mb14❤❤
What an awesome job! And cool person
He is a legend beat boxer👍👍
Please someone should tell the girl in white T-shirt and eye glass dancing and smiling that am in love with her 😊😅 5:00
Legend beatbox mb14👌
I'm a cynical old school musician. Not a fan of the show, but this is absolutely epic
Nice to see love between Britain and France!
The GOAT. 🔥
شكله عربي
Come on bruh..MB14 is a well known professional beatboxer, you guys are inviting him to perform, that's it.
Something "very crazy" about his exit from the stage told me that Lauren Allred and MB14 should collaborate on at least one song!
I Hope He will also show them his talent as a singer
I loved him since The voice France 😍
Good that was..didnt see audition so just watched now and yeh,he deserved that GB :-)...look forward to seeing what he does next..
Rien qui dépasse, tout est juste, millimétré, c'est juste génial !
Honestly the Golden buzzer ruined it for everybody lol they are now going to miss out on the best performances till the finals...he could easily win round for round without even trying lol
i close my eyes and feels like in middle eastern country or something
Wtf dude, this guy is amazing, i love that song.
I mean I was hypnotize here on my Bed after listening this...
Unreal 🙌
MB14❤️❤️ ❤️ 🔥🔥🔥👌🤗
You tube is voted by promoters and not the people if you have a negative comment they shut you down. Wake up people there’s some true talent but they look at them as money signs not people and if they continue to cancel me I will bring them down
From the Voice to BGT. So happy to see his skills getting more powerful and stronger than ever.
Again and again repeat this crazy sound…actually the name reminds me of transformers movie…”NBE1”
Amazing!
What is this Arabic or middle eastern? He has became the first beatboxer doing his nationality melody.
MB14 est le nom de scène de Mohamed Belkhir, auteur-compositeur-interprète, rappeur, beatboxeur, chanteur et acteur français et Algérien🇩🇿🇩🇿🇩🇿, né à Amiens le 19 juin 1994.
BRAVA!
"Croissant baguette" xD
if you stop to think about it, any professional looper can do this, not that the mb14 is bad, ever 🤨  ￼
Reminds me of the winner of the New Zealands got talent I think it was. He was Beau Monger. AHMAZING guys! his 1st audition was a hit the road jack mix up! Please Google his episodes as he was also a unique talent!
What a talent and a handsome face❤
Who is reading this, we don't know each other and may never know but wish you all the best in your life and all the best in the world!!!
🫵👍💫
Man finally got the reconition he deserved🎉
Completely deserved! Congrats
His name is Muhammad...he got the name of the best person in the whole world that's why he wins....
How a loopstation plays a loopstation? 🙂
لا تستغرب العربي الوحيد اني هنا  بس مو موهبه ضييم
Et il est de chez nous !
Saturated with Arabic Islamic music in the Middle East , a really great fusion that deserves the win. From Algeria
0000000000000000000

Mb14 menemukan panggungnya, semua orang tau bahwa dia yang terbaik dalam seni beatbox,pertunjukan beatboxnya tidak beruntung di battle beatbox tapi dia beruntung menjadi artis atau penghibur dalam seni beatbox, mohammad beatbox 14 (mb14)
This could easily be shown to me as an ERA song and I would buy it lol, such an amazing talent, had to watch it like 20 times, insane!
Mb14 Mohamed belkhir Algerian pride 🇩🇿🔥

He deserved the Gold buzz ❤
Me encanta cuando saluda y te toca el corazón❤
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I do not think that he is French, it seems that he only has a French nationality. His name is Muhammad, and he has Arab features. It seems that he is from an Arab country
Speechless
Bravo Mohammed .
MB14 is amazingly talented!!! He did a great job!!!
BGT delivers millions delights to the hearts of viewers at home😁
In MB14 WE trust ! Génial frérot 👍
you have seen nothing this man is BRILLIANT
Reverbもしくは各種DelayとEQ以外ほとんどエフェクトをかけずに自分から出る音を主体にしているからこその素晴らしいパフォーマンス。
Want him to win but let’s be honest let’s be honest is a French Muslim going to win Britain’s got talent no he should win but he won’t And I am in love ❤❤❤❤❤he is so hot and talented
4:50 His amazing voice sounded like it came from heaven
With a name of *Muhammad* and a *memorising voice* I'd 💚 to hear his *Azan*
👍🏻
Not only talented but appears to be a gentle soul.
Apple Watch is an illegal product saturating the market highly exploited on tv channels, illegal licences, copied software, has created mass plagiarism of genuine brand
I think it's the best performance from mb14 by far
Un vrai artiste 🎉
This is the true and unique talent
This guy is going viral around the world now . Expecially in India ❤
I have probably watched this video about a hundred times and not once could I not stop smiling and being happy about his performance. The charisma he showed on stage playing his music was incredible. It wasn't a robotic performance at all by any means and every single bit of the act was him being pure of heart and true to his passion and to himself. That is why the audience loved him and rooted for him. It wasn't the judges' golden buzzer. It wasn't Ant and Dec's either. It was the audience's and that will win you anywhere and everywhere. Can't wait to see him back with another epic performance. Good luck, MB14!
His smile is so adorable. What a personality. 😊
The talent does not hide, from the beginning I close my eyes well to enjoy the sweetness ... full of emotions at the same time. The end I cry 😢❤❤❤😢
Espetacular...
Tom Thum  2013  Sidney   Ted x      he   make   this  show  10 years ago   :)  But  all off judge  watch it first time
It's so cool to see the small beatbox community make it big into something like this
A legend in the beatbox community
one shot 4 kills...i saw him a lot in Champions beatbox, never give up...nice skill bro...
Hope he wins BGT 2023 he has made his own music which is rare these days. No one will copy his own unique style of sounds and he is one of a kind. I want his CD of songs
Tune #02 and #03 I love it
If you can get Simon too smile or looked shocked your amazing
Inspired me.
French 😂
Wow we found the winner in this year ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

I guess BGT are softer then GBB😂 But really nice to see MB14, Call Saro to BGT and stage will become a rave.
Man! This is pure talent liked every second of it 🙌🔥❤
That was incredible and so cool ! 😮🎉
He has it all!❤
a bunch of uncultured swines... they don't know who MB14 is...

Mb14 one of the best artist for beatboxing lopstation singing and everything

MB14 is a great musician, he has a full set of skills and he has a good personality, I'm glad he can come back to perform on a big stage like BGT This season will be his...
When pharaoh demands for beatbox DJ for his funeral
Several times i hear it with my tab, it sounds good...then i switch to listen it with some of my earphones/iem collections, its even better and better, very clearly entertaining...then i realized he's a trully phenomenal...❤  Its time a beatboxer takeover the game...real skill and talented...❤
Je suis un grand fan depuis des années et il intègre à chaque fois ce qu'il apprend de nouveau, il est énorme, encore la chair de poule à écouter sa performance
Truly amazing!!!
c'est grandement mérité !! il a un talent fou, une voix sublime, une rare beauté eu un sourire ravageur !!  il DOIT être reconnu pour son talent c'est un artiste avec un grand A, un concert et j'y serai un album j'achète de suite
Such a beautiful voice and smile
Now thats entertainment 🎉
Mon dieu, je te suis depuis The voice et je te trouvais déjà brillant, puis tu t'es essayé au cinéma, et là tu bous reviens sur ton art premier avec tant de brio. Bon sang, cette audition a été purement fantastique avec cette inspiration indienne. Un très très grand artiste dont on a aucun doute sur la suite de sa carrière au vu de son immense talent ! Bravo à toi !
I WANT HIS NUMBER
I don't know why but i think this music will fit into bleach anime😅
Now that's a talent.. damn , he claps 99 % of all beatboxers .
Apparently they’ve never had a voice looper on this show- which can make even my horrid voice sound magical…
Very Talentedd❤❤
MB14 is the winner of BGT 2023
Baru tau nama asli mb14 itu Muhammad 😅❤
1:43 she's cute 😍... mb14 will win BGT for sure !!!!
Bravo à notre Mb14 national ✨😎👌🏽💯
Tom Thum
yoooow GBB in da house man, damn
The fall and rise of MB14 (well not exactly a fall), i've been watching the dude for years on many places and competitions, some he won some he lose but he's steadily improved and improved the more times i see him, his music is lit and definitely be one you remember the most in said genre, even in loopstation his pieces are the one that given me the most memorable impression, aside from saro, that was legendary. He won 2nd place on french the voice cmiiw? he would be pretty high on BGT this year i bet, he would deserves it, dude's a hardworking and diligent artist.
Simon's wink means a lot to me ..... best wishes for your BGT journey 😇
the French have talent in electro , rhythm , and voice , everything is there in this video . ( disco/electro  ,.... Daft Punk , C2C , David guetta , Justice ,Bob Sinclar , Madeon , Jain , Dj Snake , Martin solveig ,  ....) even the "little " dj  ,beatbox ,  there they do crazy things
Oh god how could u win American game  when Ur not even American
I love MB14 and he is excellent at what he does but he has already won awards and is a loopstation judge AND he's been on the other Talent shows years ago. I feel like this is just taking advantage a little bit? Happy to be wrong but it rubs me the wrong way.
I watched this video sooooo many times. He’s awesome. First time seeing beatbox on stage
و كأنك في حقبة القتلي في فيلم asisian greed
Much love. Another Ant and Dec  banger of a buzzer. All the acts they back are all artists unknown by the general public, like X ( Marc spellman) previously. So happy
Ya he can sing too beautiful voice ,hes talented guy
One word : Magical <3
♥
Congratulations MD14 🎉
Britain just got the tip of the iceberg. Wait and see what this man can do. MB14!!
I’m watching MB14 career since the beginning, and almost every championship he was the second or the third , but now he just evolved so much , makes him the unique beatboxer number 1 ! 🙏🙌
mb14 is been there bruhh this is a easy win he is one of the best beatboxer bro for real
Akhirnya dibawain juga disini .. njir keren bangetttt

Reminds me of tom thum at TedX

Best of the best
MB14 is very famous in France.  He is beatbox world champion with his former group Berywam. This group performed recently, after he left it, into AGT.  As a solo artist, he was second in THE VOICE FRANCE 2016. He performed there with his loop station or as a pure singer. In 2021, he participated to THE VOICE FRANCE ALL STARS and finished 3rd.  And in 2022, he even had the lead role in a french movie called TENOR, where he plays a rapper/slammer that becomes an opera TENOR. This movie has a solid success in french theaters...  And, on top of all these great skills, you can easily see he is the sweetest soul on earth ....
He represents France so well.💖💖
I mean, this was phenomenal, but every time I see his face, my mind goes, “ he should be an actor. What a handsome man!”
He has a smile like Neymar Jr 😮😮
Finally. See MB14 in that stage. BRAVO!
That loopstation stuff goes hard af
MB14 отточил своё мастерство знатно 👍Молодец
Been following since the loopstation battles. This makes me so proud :') Lets go MB14!
What a act, what a talent, the composition of differents influences is so great. Mec tu m'as littéralement scotché et j'en avais les larmes de joie pour toi. La France peut être fier de toi, chapeau ✌️👊
I have a good feeling about this guy...brilliant  ❤
Brilliant!!
I hope he has the courage to call him self Mohammed instead of MB14. We should always feel proud and honoured to be called the name we were given
Probably the most deserving Golden buzzer in the history of BGT.... !!! 💥💥💥
No lo dejaron cantar iba a empezar a cantar paradice. 😢

Needs to make this an actual song!
確實是太棒了！西方，東方，過去，現在，完美的結合在一起！
This is real talent..💓
❤❤❤
Really sounds good.  I like this song, I wholeheartedly support it good love 💗
Ant and Dec always pick great golden buzzers. They're not concerned with backstories, they recognize pure talent and showmanship.
Can any one tell me wts the name of this bgm..?
How come people dont  know him.. he is famous beatboxer and been composing many songs and been in many compititions n shows like Voice  already.. check out his loopstation creations..
I saw his potential with the Gangsta Paradise video...that was the first time when you had to know he is indeed special one...😮❤😊
So talented... And GORGEOUS!! 😍
Islam loh dia
i loveeee the musiccccccccccccccccccccccc
That’s TALENT ❤
That was one of the most incredible sickest auditions I've ever seen on any of these shows!! ❤🫶🔥
He light up a party just by himself!
Theres sooo manyyy talented people in the beatboxx scene and MB14 is one of the best of them!!!
hey... lost one.. i heard that you feel lost in this world, you have questions on your head that never been answered, like why are we here? what is the purpose of this life? what is the purpose of death? what is going to be after death? and so on... ,  and you want the real answers for them, but the people around you are too busy chasing money and pleasures and not having the answers for those questions, and you feel miserable and depressed..  i feel you..  I've been there... i had so many years searching and searching, Intel I finally got it, it was islam all along,  how ironic, that religion that has the most hate stigma on media, was completely the opposite of what has been said about it... thats because i read the holy Qur'an my self and the prophet mohammed,s  story, and  I was blown away on how much bauty and goodness the islam religion has, then it clicked for me,  i  knew after reading, that this is the right path in this life, my life changed forever, for the better for sure,i feel happy and at peace,  I'm so greatfull to god for guiding me to the right path, and i wish you guidance too.. ♥
wait till they find out the entire world of loopstation beatbox and there are far better than mb14 lmao
I want more of this😊
4:46 Hey, this part could be transposed into a villain theme actually, and still give goosebumps. 😮
Amazing❤
Bro's a French Tom Thum
Britain doesn't understand that he's only shown us a snippet of what he can do. This guy can sing beautifully and raps as well while using the loop station. He's going to be the best act to grace on this show!
Very talented - and he has such a great smile and friendly/positive vibe about him!
yes im batikan😁
The legend is back..
Am obsessed 😱😱😱
The Happines in his Eye and Smile!😊❤
Very nice him talent....good
Mais il a un sacré talent ce gas❤❤❤❤
The other dude one the voice a few years back so he will win this for sure
I dont say this about many if not any but he has talent and such a nice bloke, very humble and very good, well done
Bgt can be this music next theme music
i mean he was good not as good as the judges made him out to be. maybe the votes are for his looks and that he is french if a bin man went on and done this he would get no where
I swear he’s done this on the voice? Or somewhere else?
His smile so beautiful ❤
Loved him, his smile, sense of humour and humility
So glad he came to Britain, I had never heard of him or seen him until we saw him on BGT TV. Awesome!!
That totally was not him! I refuse to believe it!
Simon did so many cosmetic surgeries that now he has to act all the time he saw a ghost so he can open his eyes hahahahaha
Your name Mohammed ma shaa Allah
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Some of us have heard of him, guess we know who's winning this year. Nice one MB14 🤘🏼
Can't wait to watch him in person
Mohamed, what a great talent 👏
@swissbeatbox
Imagine if Saro comes on.
Great set MB14! 💯
Gorgeous inside and out.
There's a new Beardyman in town
OHH YESS HELLOO TOO
C'est tellement mérité! Je le suis depuis The Voice et ce gars a un talent fou!❤
Ok, now, if you’re want another exemple of his talent, check this Blind audition at The Voice France « gangsta paradise ». You’re welcome. 😁
Emotional inspirational that was the real art
he made a huge perf at the voice france
Omg no words🫶🫂🤝
Damn his hair matches with his incredible talent
Wow tallent ❤.and he is handsome.
This is shows that French wont take you far
MOHAMED 😍😍😍
Missing saro😂
Alhamdulillah that’s my brotherrrrr! Really enjoyed that vid! I can watch it over and over again! I love Ants reaction 😂 no no no Merci to you!
How they never heard about MB14? He was part of Berywam beatbox group and he is by far the best beatboxer at the world also he is a singer and probably next winner of this show.
Guessing he's a fan of Tom Thum
Yes brooo. MB14 will be so famous no one will ever beleive I once beat him in a solo beatbox battle 😂😂😂 but fo real massive respect its all deserved
that is not hard to do, the judges are a little bit in old times😱  i have my groovebox and is very easy you do not need a good voice to do it .   there is plenty of people doing that for ages around the world . not impress at all but good luck for him.
Well done mate, you deserved it 🎉
muslims are attractive in a spiritual way, ngl
Sam Perry is good than him...
This MB14 song has 4 years 😂
Absolutely brilliant ❤👌
WOW That's Real Talent ❤
Poor poor cleaners...
Bring back David… !!
I respect you🎉❤
He’s going to win this year💯🔥🤞🏾
Jusqu'au bout du monde... Vive la France !,!
What? He just got talent? His dad did not shot his mom in front of him? He did not call him just to tell him he's gonna take his life? He did not lose a leg in a plane crash? No cancer, no disability, no sad story?
Tradução em português, cadee kkkk
MB14..is like John Wick on them decks 😊
Niesamowity gość absolutnie rewelacja !!!!!!!!!!!!!😂

Love MB14, but...he is a professional beatboxer and loopstation performer...i thought these shows were about unknown talent etc?? Like I say, nothing against him, but doesnt seem right
I already know that he will be the next BGT 2023 winner… he has everything!!! Talent, persona, oh my… handsome…. Everything!!! Good luck MB14!
He give us absolutely great audition will stuck in our minds for long times. Totally deserve golden puzzer ❤❤

Simon: Look at them, they were like greyhounds out of a truck. 😄

If he doesn't win this year BGT, I wonder who will
Hmm😲

When the beat drops, hell breaks loose
Look at Simon reaction 😂😂😂
Glad to hear you again, youre great man!

How many times have you replayed this ? 20*
I hate beatbox but when I heard this for the first time.... goosebumps for me....
this is what about contest to show what you love to do ans share it to everyone. good job.
He even made the voice and I was so sad to not see him anymore, that’s so cool !!!
The slow mows are painful as. Mb14 is sheer class.
Next level and next generations beat boxer.
One of the best golden buzzer ever❤
He is unbelievable
Should b called Britain’s got no talent,every year they hav to bring in people with actual talent from outside d uk to make up d numbers
MB14 Legend 🎉
I saw MB14 live when he won the Battle of the Year 2019 comp in Belgium ... He is SO good it's unbelievable.
I've been watching this tv show since the beginning. if anyone got the golden buzzer, every time, tears in my eyes.  Talent has no borders or no barriers. Love from 🇱🇰
bravo MB14 trop fort
Bro looks like seth rollins , its mad......
You can search MB14 VS SARO Your welcome! That's real show
Voilà ainsi comment se rejoignent musiques du monde, styles de chant et culture mixte... pour 3 minutes grandioses.
Un ancien berywam 🎉❤

AWESOME FROM INDONESIA
Song?

I f---king love it
ini yang kita sebut paket komplit. Ia terlalu sempurna baik dari segi fisik maupun bakat.. semua usaha yang ia lalui selama 10 tahun ini akan terbayarkan.. mereka yang tau dirinya mungkin sudah tau bahwa ia bukanlah orang yang mudah menyerah..ia terus mencoba dan maju terus pantang mundur dalam menggapai impian nya..
Wot ay man I can't stop watching it the best gets me on my feet xx
I love it🤩🤩
He looks like Adam Driver
He deserve it. knowing him 10 years ago. love it
Yes some real talent go MB14
It was soooo good it gave me constipation
Hope he. Wins
BRILIANT! The Best beatboxer ever!
I thought he looked familiar! He sang Gangstas Paradise on the Voice/France and just crushed it! So glad he is now on BGT!
When white people sounds like Arab terrorist they made up
he is legend beatboxer👏🏻👍🏻
Richard Gere at prime
Haven’t heard him sing but I think his the one my pastor said is my husband. He said his name will be Mohammed and he will be from France and I will find him on YouTube agt 😊 and here we are , where we going from here baby ?
Well, this audition turned into a concert ❤
Nice brother love u and god bless you 🤗
Mashallah definitely talented he could win it if he's sticks to this style of beat boxing because its unique
He just blow our minds😮
Beautiful epic brilliant
Got introduced to "The Voice" 7 years back via the iconic Coolio's Gangsta Paradise! Rich knowledge gained solely from beatboxing communities!! Given the fact that judges aren't aware of him.. we are looking at a potential overall winner here
He’s to cool. That’s awesome.
Did you know he was in the BERYWAM beatbox group. The last 'M' in BERYWAM is actually him. Later 'Beasty' came when he left the group.
4:47 gave me goosebumps,  it's just insane , the mixture of the classical Arabic music with hip-hop and old Latin fashion is simply a master piece
damn this looks so like a setup but i know it's know cause it's MB14 we are talking
❤😂WOW, great beatbox singer actor he would make a good Jesus in the movie I'm sixty-eight years old and I loved listening to him❤❤❤❤🎉
🎉🎉🎉🎉👏👏👏👏👏😍😍😍
He was on the voice france.  He also showed up for the all stars sounding even better
next SARO...
absolutely brilliant, just makes you smile watching this.
Caramba 😮
Amazing!!!
Whoever noticed that in the first show, the contestant mentioned his name "MOHAMED", and then after that they deleted it It is racism, and then comes America, which boasts that it is the country of democracy and freedoms
What the hell, It was really awesome… nice show
أيا دزيرييين مغاربة توانسة وراكم 🎉🤪
The Crew did a great job showin us all of their emotions golden buzzer for y'all too
Next contestant watching this be like 👁👄👁
Amplement mérité, son talent et son travail sont énormes !! Bien joué mec 💪🏼
We acknowledge you our tribal chief!!☝️
He look like John Travolta  Take a close look again
Ladies be dancin' real good yall!
The editing in that golden buzzer press, and even leading up to it was perfection!
This is a fantastic talent and performance! The result of competing with one of your best, Saro.
Dessert game final boss
❤
The king is back 🐐👑
this guy ex berywam or ?
Kereen dari duluuu🔥🔥🔥
The smile is very contagious, then he is very talented. ❤
so good to see he's getting the recognition he deserves!! <3
His personality tells everything 👍🏻
Doesn't hurt that he is also easy on the eye. 😉 Well done. 🎉
What is the title of background music? :)) tyiA
Incredible audition!!!  love it!
Amazing. I come from Cambodia
Beyond the beatbox world, he also deserves that you watch his acting talent in the movie TENOR!  It is a complete and rare talent!
NAMASTE! GOD BLESS YOU.
Start Beatbox 2:50
MB14 LE MEILLEUR !!
Awesome! Incredible ! Les personnes sont comme toutes hypnotisées. Quelle performance ! Hâte de voir la demi-finale et surtout ce que tu nous a préparés comme prestation !!
Not putting a dampness on all this but why a the two ladies been mic so we can hear them?
I can't stop watching this! It's sooooo good!
Well, he is not one of the finest beatboxer at all, but a combination of loop artist and beatboxer.
Ahhh yes, the uncultured are starting to get cultured.
Would love to see a collaboration with Dub FX
MB 14 and Tom Thum are the 2 i've seen with similar talents.

Malah konser
1 voice crack and it’s all over.💀💀💀
Pendant ce temps-là … la France le regarde alors qu’il a n’a pas été jugé à sa juste valeur … bravo MB14 🎉
MB14 vs SARO - better check it!
100% he deserves  But judges behaviour seems too obviously artificial...and that looks funny)and I 100% sure they knew who'd be the golden buzzer,you can all judge it by the look of their eyes
Excelleeeeeeent 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
One of the legend of loopstation.
Good job Muhammad 👍🏼 Go rock the stage of BGT 🎉🎉

MB14 Is a part of his name...Mohamed B . and his lucky number 14 . Like the number of Johan Cruyff .
MB14 has matured. It's clean and smooth on most part and it only gets raw and dirty when he wants to. This audition is industry-ready MB14.
Excuse me lol
Well deserved
He deserves it much love from Kigali Rwanda ❤❤
And check him in the movie "Ténor by Claude Zidi Jr". He's stunning !
Amazing 🤩👍
Mb14 the goat
Best Performance ever, Everything well deserved.👑🤘🔥
Is he not apart of berywam (spelt bad)
he is amazing but why does it all look so staged ? i felt like watching a movie rather than live audition
This makes me soooo happy to see my man still achieving great things🔥
Mohamed bel kheir tiaret

Love seeing this guy on here. Been watching his beatboxing for a couple years now. He's for sure one of the best to ever do it. What makes his performance even more outstanding, he doesn't use any effects on his voice. Just the loop. Its pure skill. He's incredible.
Jumped straight into old school!!! <3
Incroyable
Youtube shoud be banished for putting ads in such moment like 4:38  it should be forbidden. Really.
Tu mérites mb14..tu aurai dû gagner en France ou au moins tu aurais dû percer
Amazing. This is awesome!
Simon clearly never saw The Voice France
Bobby mcferrin with some eastern mood💌💌💌💌
What a wonderful and astonishing discover! That’s the best performance I have seen, great great carrier ahead. Chills and everything linked to it! Keep it up MB14!
MB14 is a professional and not an amateur. This is not fair to others. It's like if a professional singer e.g. Beyonce appeared on the show and sang.He is a professional in his profession.
Mb14 the leader of berywam now all british will know who is the M of berywam
Berrywam should watch this😂❤
Mb14 my morrocan homechild  is a genius
Very very talented !!! 🎉🎉 Amazing !!! 😀👏🏻❤️❤️🤩
He played in a good movie in France called Ténor where he played a rapper with an incredible talent for Opéra
WOW
A world champion using one of his best bullets. No a surprise that people is crazy.
That was truly amazing.
Wow just wow superb what a talent cant believe it . Its deserved the golden buzzer.
His shy smile when Alesha complimented his hair<3
Sadly he didn’t mention his arabic origines and he said he is french although he isn’t…
What a catchy name and awsome performance 🎉🎉
He was HyPnOtiC
Wow wow wow amazing ❤
I'm so happy to see MB14 get this kind of reaction. Great Job M8!

Der ist so franz wie ein ponczek russisch ist 🥱🥱🥱🥱
Mohamprett....?bin raus...Haben davon genug und die franzmänner genug Stress mit diesen Leuten
This act not worth for a golden buzzer . Golden buzzer should give for acts that never seen and for very unique acts🤦

Can't express my ecstasy watching him competing in Beatbox 4 years ago to this big stage. Phenomenal,he's come really far🎉❤
wow
From 3:34 to 3:38  I knew this part , but 3:25  I don’t know where ? 😭
NOW THAT IS WHAT I CALL TALENT!!! I've never seen anything like this before.  Better than just sadistic singers all the time.
Simon cowell got plastic surgery or what??🤔 he look not normal !! 😯🫣 or aging??

Never heard of him?  Sorry for your wasted Time xD
YES MB, ESHHHH
He deserves it !!❤
He is here to win ❤
Brilliant and he's have a really good voice 👏👏👏
I knew he will blow got talents
That fact that he crafted this track perfectly from so many times doing it is utterly mind-boggling. MB14 is a true legend❤
he used theta sounds for the background, these are the sounds used in hypnosis 4-8hz used during the entire hypnosis session, look at the audience's faces at the beginning. It was pointed out by the juror at the end of his performance that he felt hypnotized. he knew what he was doing. NICE!
pure talent !
Audition "ROYALE  " aux Britain's Got Talent. Il ne pouvait pas en être autrement de par le talent de notre MB14 .
MB14 don't need Golden Buzzer. Golden Buzzer needs him🙌
Wonderful audition but also so wonderfully humble as well. Good luck for the rest of the competition
A Monster so cool and cold . Talent
He is not beatboxer,dude is ARTIST,just give him win already,epic performance...
@the kiffness need to get out there too awesome act 🎉😅
Am I the only one wondering whatever happened to his girlfriend, who was at 'that' audition?
Never seen a contestant this confident, this talented and yet, this humble. Bravo. 👏👏

BERYWAM  (BEATNES ,RYTMIND , WAWAD ,MB14)

BEATBOX LOOPSTATION ARE THE BEST🔥 AND MB14 YOU DESERVE THAT GOLDEN BUZZER 🔥
Best ❤  4:26
The Original BERYWAM Member is back to stage. I'm a Fan from the Philippines "Beatbox is not a hip-hop thing, It's a Universal thing." -Rahzel
un pur génie
Baru tau nama asli nya 😍 MB14
Please do check Tom Thum
😱😱😱 His incredible vocal range is simply out of this world! His complete music is too. Simply unbeliiiievably fantastic! 👍👌👏👏👏
It is crazy how he is feeling it at 5:56, that's universal alignment :)
Apa cuma saya orang Indonesia
La france represente
Incroyable vraiment la France et derrière toi🇫🇷
Still to win GBB though :D
Simons face looks awful. Looks like he’s had a stroke .
@Berywam , berywam should reqrut this person

anjay wellplayed MB14
When you are actually The Man Of The Party!!!! You only need MB14 and some drinks…….!!!!!!!! GO SHOW EM DUDE!!!! Can’t wait for the next!!!! (Listening on repeat!!)

Quand un franco Algérien réussit dans n'importe quel domaine , on a pleins de phénomènes , sans retenue , les français le proclament comme l' un des leurs mais si il flanche le racisme hideux français refait surface  quelle hypocrisie !
Esh!
You deserve it 🎉
No need of synths to be spectacular !
Not as good as silo though haha
If he didn't get that golden buzzer. France will send SARO next✌️

Tout simplement monstrueux ! ! Bravooo Mohamed 👏👏👏👏👏 bonne chance pour la suite !
احمد محسن
What’s the song at 5:35
MB14 vs Saro will still be the best loop battle ever in a 100 years.
If this guy doesn’t win than this show is not won by talent
wow Dz power, perform in UK, tell me when that's happening in France, so much french migrant perform around the world and block in France....   so happy for you MB14 and thank for UK to explose talent people and don't care where they come, wich degrees they have, or how much money family have for listen, look & test the Talent.   Attention de pas rentré dans les travers de Berrywam, devenu je trouve bobo, et on oublié beast box street original, de la rue.  Mohammed Mach'Allah 👍
My maaaaaannnn MB14 finally get the attention he deserve
The scratch is unbelievable!!
Gada obat cuk, Mantapppp!!!!
My favourite Looper Since 2016
Great skills but I’m intrigued by the use of the mixer, was it to add effects or to record and repeat some sections? I’m not being negative but I like to hear beatboxers live or without effects so you can see it’s just pure vocals
He is halal y’all 🥹
So glad he didnt sing yet. Keep us waiting for the next round.  👍👏
This guy sang, and made real music only with his voice. Yet he STILL brought the house down Masha'Allah! 🔥
MB14 is muslim !?
Reminds me of the legendary Battle vs Saro 🔥
I think Ant and Dec like him
C’est le meilleur en France avec berywam et saro , le golden c’est juste normal pour moi avec son morceau pyramids qui es juste incroyable depuis 2018 son album je l’écoute franchement on s’en lache jamais ❤
When you carry the group project all by yourself
Pure muslim talent
Incroyable mb14 comme d'habitude depuis the voice ca change pas 🥰🥰 bien mérité le golden buzzer
😂😂😂❤❤
Talent 😅
kereeeennnn......
Слежу за mb14 с 2014 года. Он лучший в своём деле . Молодец ❤🎉😢
World needs more talents like him. You need only voice, passion to music and that device, concert is made.❤️❤️❤️❤️
he's gonna be a tough one to compete this year, no DOUBT that i liked him so much.
Fascinating 😮this is splendid !! Literally I am over the moon. Wonderful Talent. Nothing I have seen and heard from a human instrument. Well deserve !!
in this video you can see how wonderful people can be. How we can be happy for the other and get emotional when another person is happy.
MB14 est plus qu'un talent c'est un véritable artiste, il fait encore une fois une performance incroyable!
Good thing there is a lot of stuff from him in yt
Un petit "gangsta's paradise" pour la finale et il aura tué le game 👍👍👍👍
If i was to rate every got talent performances. This would be my top 1.
MasyaAllah.. Amazing..
I've been following MB14 for years. His story is a real shame... He's one of the most musical loopstationers in the beatbox community, but the largest beatbox organization (Swiss Beatbox) started owning and copywriting all content of individual artists, screwing talented musicians out of 10s and even 100s of thousands of dollars (cumulative millions of dollars). In addition to that, they then didn't own their own creative content.  I'm glad MB14 was able to break free. He was runner up of France's "The Voice", now got the gold buzzer in BGT... a true showcase and recognition for his talent.
Brutal ❤
toujours autant de simplicité malgré sont talent unique. MB14 est un musicien/chanteur extraordinaire.
OMG! That is talent
MB14 ♥️♥️♥️
Finally the world will know who MB14 is
Who's don't know him..?? He's a legend in beatbox !!  I bet, He gonna win this show !!
Il urmăresc pe băiatul ăsta de vreo 10 ani...MB14...in sfarșit..ai reușit..omg..❤❤❤❤
An absolute mind blowing eargasmic experience 🤜🤛
È stato due volte a the voice francia
Magical 🥰🥰🥰
Et dire que le connaissant, il n'est même pas à 10% de son talent. .. C'est ce qu'on appelle "être habité". Le mec se permet même de rester humble après une prestation XXXL.  Bravo MB14 et tout le monde devrait connaître et voir son film : "Ténor"
BEARDYMAN 2:0
He is an incredible looper just like the guy who won in Australia a few years ago
Daniel Ricciardo from France with long hair 😅
🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵
You have beautiful name Muhammad ❤
Get this guy to edc vegas
saking gabutnya aing udah tau loopstation duluan ketimbang para jurinya
MB14 deserve it! 💯 Hardwork + Patience
high level

Incroyable talent ! MB14 reste dans les esprits à la minute où l'on l'entend 👏👏💪 Félicitations 🎊
Hobbits went for a golden buzzer :)
He proud the country France 🇫🇷 Love you ❤ Man 👍
හොඳයි. සවුදම් දන්නවද​?
This amaaaazing!!!!
anjayy mb14 gacoan gw
And he is so fu××ing cute damn
He is also a very good singer. We don't see everything of him in this performance.
Winner!
Identity theft is not a joke Jim!!
So weeeerd
This is why I stopped watching these types of shows beat boxes is not worthy of a golden buzzer right along with dog acts and group dance acts they should not be allowed it's not talent 🙄.
Wow! Amazing!
He look like my mom's younger brother i mean my uncle My uncle has a beautiful hair like him and a nice attitude and great style this made me remembered him alot
Legend is on the deserved stage. Congratulations again MB14!!! 👍
If only Saro came running on and crashed the audition🤣
MB14 🔥🔥🔥
Mb14  could be MB 4 TEA 4 ME haha very handsome ,sexy and high vibrational soul  energy. Not to mention his talent journeys  my soul through ages and time to places i once belonged and yearn to again. I LOOOOVVVVE HIS SOUL AND TALENT
He looks like an Indian guy who won India has got talent through using beat boxing
Those talent and then that face damnnnnnnnnn❤❤❤
Im sad my favorite judge is not right there.. where is david????
Such a lovely person with unique talent and humble manners !
He really deserves it ❤🎉
For BGT it was a first time never seen before performance worthy of a golden buzzer. For the BBX community, it was a Tuesday.
Wooow😮😮
He diserved it❤
He's already a phenomenal right now. Really awesome and genius performance.
This is the real Beatbox!!  Welcome to Beatbox world 😎
Imagine Codfish joining BGT
His attitude already made him a people’s champion
This guy goes way beyond beatboxing… he’s another level of talent. Glad he got the golden buzzer, he deserves it. I’ll buy an album made by him.
I wanna see what he can do without a loop station
Dang my man bulked up a bit since last time I watched his videos.
Had to watch it twice
Meskipun gw gak bisa beatbox, tp gw sangat ngepens sama mb14 ❤️
"10 seconds" 😅
Definently this years winner.
I was like, he looks like MB14 and then seen the comments confirming it is in fact MB14 lmao thats sick.
So this is a remix of his song Pyramid
Bruh u guy's are literally not ready for him
He is good talent, It's wonderful
MB14 is the beatboxer that once i heard him for the first time, he instantly became my favourite one  and if he had more time he would've impressed you more than he already did, you should really look at his other videos and see him performing like a real star...well he is a real star he was with berywam (BEatness/RYthmind/WAwad/Mb14), but since he was working on his own projects and projects of the team he had to take the decision to leave because he does too much work and then beasty "replaced" his place but not his talent he almost got it twice in the voice french edition, he kept impressing and mind blowing everyone until the finals but sadly he didnt win i hope he wins this time insha allah, he never disappoints, he's the best mashallah
When the intro sounded like the same soundtrack in Japanese Anime “Demon Slayer”. I love it 🥰
Boss level
Je t’ai vu dans ma ville et bravo du chemin parcouru 😄tu as un sacré talent 🎉🎉
Watch him competing against Saro. It was one of my favorite battle.
Su sonrisa es lo mejor ❤
🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤
That judge is a freak! You know he's got a record and bodies buried...
LES GOOO❤
Oh my gosh😮 The more you listen, the more excited😢❤❤
Love MB14, discovered him on The Voice France in 2016. I can still remember the chills I had during his blind audition and then his other performances. He was my favourite! Made it up to the finals ;)
Je suis extrêmement fier de toi jai suivit ton parcours depuis The voice, ton films Tenor qui est extraordinaire. Avec ce que la France traverse en ce moment tu apporte de la lumière salvatrice. Merciiiii ✨️ tu es épatant  Bon courage
Lots  of love from 254❤️❤️❤️
I wish him all the best...but...hmmm...remember SARO
He's a star!
Made in France, bien joué Mohamed tu as régalé comme d'habitude !
Amazing ❤❤❤
if there was a new police academy film ( sorry Michael Winslow ! ) MB14 would be perfect !
Is he Arab Maghreb background?
OMG
Waiting for Swissbeatbox reaction and comment, when MB14 get a Golden Buzzer. 😌
Television is terrible.
Mb14 been on a lot of show though
Why does he not reveal his real name and nationality?  (M)ohamed (b)elkhir.       M b 14  Algérienne
ESH❤️‼️
This guy is so fantastic!
And the smile and laughter on his face is wonderful 💕
I just saw this video today and I can boldly say my rewatch has been on a loop pedal. My smile was from the beginning to the end. This year's audition has been really joyful and fun.  Thank you @MB14 for waiting for the right time.....from the beatbox community to the world. Enjoy!!!!
🔥🔥🔥
If anyone wants to see this man in a competition against other people who also do this kind of music, try "MB14 vs SARO" - it's fairly old now but it's widely regarded as one of the best beatbox loopstation battles of all time :)
Get this man on stage at a Rave festival !
Il mérite tellement ❤
Thats just some pure talent, got damn
song ???
Mb14 i love the India sound mix with beatbox ❤he got the greatest bgt track off all time. he took the next level on to the next level😮.                                                         ❤️the greatest beatbox i ever heard❤️
I'm French, I already know him, but he improves every time, it's amazing!
Oh i remember him in the voice france when he sang that's the time i remember him maaaan ❤️
oh my god, yes, just yes.
Amazing Sounds vocal😮
Probably the only BGT performance I got chills from.
Bravo MB14 tu le mérites tellement, tu sais que nous français nous sommes fier de toi et je n'ai jamais oublier cette finale de the voïce. Que cette fois ça soit ton tour 🥰
Yeeaahh MB14 great performance. And what a personality! ❤
Maybe next year Beyonce needs to join this BGT and get golden buzzer as well.
MB14!!🙌♥️♥️
Good for us bro i love you very much MB14 ❤️❤️❤️
Former padawan of MIKAAAA
It s incredible
Okay I see u French John Krasinski
3:41 le gars ressemble a joyca😅
He's extremely talented ❤
Comme toujours il a été MONSTRUEUX, il ne cesse de surprendre le monde avec ses performances c'est vraiment incroyable, aucun mot suffisement fort pour décrire son talent et son travail, juste perfect.
🚜 🇮🇹 🙂👍 - SPETTACOLARE! 👍👍👍
Congrats MB14! True talent and showmanship ! been watching you for years and very well deserved!
Which instrument is it that he acting?
Can't believe none of the judges had ever heard of this man. He's amazing 👏
Bravo ❤ it was indeed a phenomenal performance Mohammed 🎉 chapeau bas!!!!
ابو جاسم
There is something fishy about this show; the way the audience and the judges are absolutely wonderstruck at so many things. I used to watch certain acts on TV during Christmas holidays in the 80s. I am not saying this guy is not phenomenal at what he does, but there are many similar auditions around the world.  Also, the way Simon is wonderstruck when someone presses the golden buzzer. Yes, Simon, each of you is expected to do it once. What are you so surprised about?
Lol, what's with the mic'd up audience?🤦🏻‍♂😂 Good performance though!
i remember when he did Gangster paradise in 2016 and he set the standard and broke the taboo of loopbeatboxer to be scene as a valid.
No doubting MB14's talent, but Beardyman was doing a VERY similar act 15 years ago ...
Yeah MB14 is known with his performance in France (2014) He sang song Coolio -  Gangsta`s Paradise but NOW his performance for me is similiar to Sam Perry :) ( known from When doves cry )
Esh esh! If anyone is interested, watch a movie where Momo is the main star, It’s called Ténor and I really liked the movie!
Les algériens il sont par tout a baba
Just imagine performa berywarm with mb14 on Britain's got talent
i have been following mb 14 for the past 10 years and that guy sill amazed me every time
Consecutive beatboxing is much better not recording a beats to then mix them together
What a performance. French guy playing Egyptian type music with ultra Pro beatboxing.
MB14!!!!!! Omg when I saw him.. my mind keep projecting the guy(audience)who made many facial reactions on his face during MB14 battling with other beatboxer 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂❤️
How does this work does the machine hes using allow him to transform his voice?
T’as assuré grave ! T’es un génie ! Félicitations 🇫🇷
MB14 VS SARO ! best loopstation battle ever !
No words!
He gives me wife-beater vibes
Mb14 with beard is OP
un futur tube planétaire  <3 <3 <3
Bice job amazing 😉
Thái Sơn beatboxing VietNammes
Bruh, he didn't rap yet. 😅
Yo mb ☝🏾🤩
Mb14 is one of those that you never forget, i always think about is battle against saro imagine a battle beetwen these 2 in 2023 that will be the best battle of the world !!! Congratulations mb14! you deserve it
MB14 is beatbox legend and showing everyone what the art of beatboxing can do. He needs to win.
Welcome to loopstation beatboxing the world😉💪
Berywam ❤ love U guys
oh le frero !
I was hoping that he was about to play pieage
He deserves the golden buzzer but I don't believe Simon and that he doesn't know who he is and that he doesn't know where he's been all his life. I am Spanish and thanks to the internet I have seen him on the voice France, he is the protagonist of a film called "Tenor". I'm not French and I know all this and I sure haven't seen even 10% of their performances. That's why I don't think Simon didn't know anything about him, even I know!
Il yavait un autre comme ça ás the Voice Australia...trop fort
his name is Mohamed Belkhir, born in France (French)  of Algerian origin.. ♥️🇫🇷🇩🇿♥️
ეს ბიჭი გაიმარჯვებს ჩემი წინასწარმეტყველება
He was also at the voice
Bien joué MB14  🟦⬜🟥
I’ve been watching his performances for years !! He’s a special talent, glad he got recognized ❤❤🎉
il a fait bouger toute la salle  on vois le travail qu'il a du accomplir depuis the voice  tres grand acteur aussi a voir sur le film " Tenor "
MB14 that was just 5% , he got lot more wait and watch
LOVE MB14 FANTASTIC BEATBOX PERFORMER THIS IS A VERY TALENT WOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWW😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
Quel talent, quelle lumière...fan depuis le début à the voice, puis dans le film...et maintenant, quels progrès avec toujours autant de grâce...un vrai rayon de soleil qui attire les larmes ! BRAVO MB14 !!!
8:13 is he the man on swiss beatbox... while performing  their always focus???
Great Job 🎉 MB14 much love ❤🎤
Back ground song name please🙏🏻☺
Hey i know that guy.... that's saro's friend
MB14 has been working hard for almost 10  years and earned his place on a bigger stage.  Swissbeatbox is international, but the audience is (sadly) niche. (4.75 M subscribers) He's well known in France, but even The Voice France has 3.11 M subscribers. 3 days after posting, this video has 3.3M views, and counting. He isn't "unknown" but wasn't known outside of these audiences. I don't know or care if he was "scouted" - and I hope the "it's fixed!" press drives traffic to his amazing videos, to beatboxing in general, and to his music sales.
Muhammad you rock 🎉, stay blessed ❤
what i like about Mb14 he is very good at bass (4:20)😮
He's on a looper it was on the voice.
I would say this is my new favourite video 👀👀
Un francais qui laisse bouche ouverte simon ca fait plaisir gg  gros
MB14 is an absolute OG, incredible talent for many years
3,3 M views in 3 days WOW. THAT'S A BRILLIANT TALENT MB14 !!!!!
finally he  got what he deserved
he's  a legend.. and he is my idol... with Tom thum..
Supeeeeeer 🎉 J'espère qu'il ira loin
Vive la France et MB14. Love Great Britain ❤
Esh 🔥
Das die Juroren nicht den Film The Tenor kennen. In Frankreich ist er ein Star.
this could be a final boss theme 😮
That's amazing performance on got talent !!!
He was replaced from Berywam he was one of my idols
Unbelievable wow
drop the beat  4:54  🔥
I know him before BGT, from another show. I can't wait to see next show of MB14. Bravoo..
Never bored after 1000000000x watch.

La classe quand même !  Bravo MB14!
He HAS to win
He didn’t get a single Yes. And he wanted four.  Shucks i feel bad for him. Then those two push the buzzer and threw all those tiny paper at him.
Di ulang ulang..ttp kereeen
WOW😲😲
Just a spark who had  watch Swiss Beatbox
Esh. About time a real beatboxer takes this stage. The world is about to learn what the art really looks like.
He copied rolex theme(bgm) 🤷🏾‍♂️
MB14 really deserved it. Congrats
ça envoie! (Je le connaissais depuis The voice - France)
MB14 has definitely got. With his personality and stage presence he should go far 👌
.................................😮..................
Nos français on du talent ^^ gg bg
OMG😳 what a talent
Joli mélange Mo'... Bien joué grand! Jte suis maintenant ...blast les brits : leur fera du bien ! Eye on u fella.
Keren loe bro
What’s the background song was?
What’s the name of the song in the background after the golden buzzer?
Moi qui te connais depuis ton enfance comment je suis fier de ton parcours  bravo à toi mohamed MB14
the annunaki love this music
Good looking, friendly, such a nice lad! He’s going to win this whole competition! What a performer!!!
When Simon winks at you and give you a thumbs up, you did it right lol.
Beardyman does exactly the same thing and has been for years. Great talent but not entirely original
Imagine if that's SARO on stage.
MB14 is well-known in France since his participation in the Voice France in 2014 and made it to the final show 👏  Bravo Mohamed vous avez un talent immense que le monde va découvrir grâce à cette performance à BGT
mb14猛者感エグすぎる
Esh!
I cannot be disrespectful to MB14 as he's good no brilliant at what he has done however DUB FX has been doing the same for a while now with all the big stars, however he's the first on BGT and I respect him for what he's doing keep up the good work 👏 👍
Underwhelming honestly. Feels like I've seen beatboxers do similar things but without the whole mixing board. Isnt that the whole point with beat bowing anyways? To do it inly with your mouth?
Loved everything about him including his real name 🎉 this is really really phenomenal and genuine
100 rewatch
I've watched this so many times
That is talent 🔥 ❤
This is just a glimpse, you would be surprised by his next performances. He is a very good rapper too!
MB14: Beatbox💯 Sing💯 Act💯 Loopstation🔥  He is a real alien wtf🙌🏽
Pyramids🔥
E S H !
Super prestation, tu les as bluffé. Impressionnant. J'espère que tu ira le plus loin possible🤞
Proud of you MB14 aka Mohammad 🔥
He's good but its been done better already.. Beardy Man is the OG
The only beatbox act/audition i enjoyed rily.. bcus its not same as the usual beatbox.. him doing dat high note opera-like is wow!! He can sing too for sure!
Yes he is like a monkey  for the enemys..
Above all is his smile.. genuine smile u cud see.. makes him looks good more..
I haven't seen a beatboxer get recognized on a talent show since Joel Turner here in Aus, that was ages ago
Soooooo whats the name of the song, I need it on Spotify ASAP!!!
Simons face is an absolute picture the whole time 😂
Can’t believe MB14 came on our Britains Got Talent. He is an incredible beatboxer looper. And has an amazing singing voice also! Hopefully his performances will inspire other professional beatboxers to step up. Being British myself would love to see D Low, Reeps, Hobbit etc
@3:41 young paul McCartney is smiling. 😅😂
jergo beats should be here
He smiles Brilliant !!!
What is his name?
👉🏻🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wait for Saro to come to Gottalent.
he should reunite with berywam for once
Beardyman where u at
If I'm not mistaken he was also a contestant on The Voice of France. He definitely stepped up his game.
One man show,BRAVOOOOO.
Dat actually his show... 👌👌👌👌👌  I like him alot
this guy gonna be a legend
He is Arabian Muhammad, why don't you say your origins man!!!! 😐🎉
مزيد من النجاحات ان شاءالله
very talented and very handsome men from France, seriously, he is qualified representing France in a male international pageant.. because hes very charming and beautiful smile.
In France we are lucky to have such great superstars! MB14 and Berrywam are two amazing beatboxers!! 😊😊😊😊😊😊
holleee, this is the coolest youtube video i've seen. the whole thing is just cool. well done MB14 👏
He is paving the road for the next generation of beatboxing and beatboxers. I bow down👏
Genadiz papiz Tachencho laughs of this.

C'est fait , je suis content pour toi et merci pour ta bonne humeur . Reste humble car bientôt tu vas jouer dans de grandes arènes et il va falloir garder la tête sur les épaules .Cordialement Joel .

MB14 vs SARO... superbbbb

i am glad to see you MB14
This man gat me dancing jn the office....gadddamn!!!!!!!!!!
MB14 comeback?
I like this guy.. his cool and talented
Amazing 👏 ❤❤❤
how many times did you watch this..  me: absolutely sensational!!
I repeat myself but, Simon is lucky ! He saw Berywam live (MB14 was a former member) And now MB14.  And to adress what "Simon said" : Sadly, Fr ain't the place to be, to be discovered. Many artists or even just to work, or start a company, we have to migrate anywhere else. He started "blowing up" in Switzerland ^^  Glad the World got to learn about this dude.  "Merde" pour la suite mec
Wooow
How does he do that😊😊
Man,  they've got to get rid of these Audience sound bites , no one cares what they have to gossip about.  Its the most cringiest thing ever !
What a humble being MB14. Congratulations
ESH!
I feel so happy for him 😃
More important question than this guy show, where is Howie? xd
Wow….
I'm not surprised 🙂 It's that MB14😁😁😁
Good talent good looking god really loves him 😂
Montre leur comment ça se passe
❤
Cela peut prendre du temps avant que le talent soit reconnu à sa juste valeur, mais il sera reconnu vaille que vaille. Ce gars en est l'exemple parfait ! Humble, bosseur, patient et voilà ! Bon vent @MB14
MB14 is one of the greatest beat boxers to date.
bien jouer mb14 j'adore simons aussi :) franchement hâte de voir la suite
What the heck... I've been repeating this for an unhealthy amount. I want to watch his show!!!
Such as an inspiration man! Go spread your wings MB14!
What happened to Simon’s face?, Botox?
I’ve been a fan since 🔥❤ MB14 🔥
MB14 est très fort. En beatbox on l'avait compris depuis quelques années, plus récemment en acteur + chanteur d'opéra (j'étais bluffée), donc cette très bonne prestation ne m'étonne pas le moins du monde. Les british vont l'adorer !
Next stage, please share some sad stories and make them cry, I swear you can be the champion. "I was disabled to walk for 1 year after I was born"
Bros got no competition
There is somebody that deserves it. Absolutely deserves it.
the public  can of ruined the performance with all their noises
Its showtime
Congratulations MB14 keep it up Show to The World how to perform the Advance Beatboxing 👏👏👏
Such an awesome talent ! Wow!  I was blown away ! Just fabulous !
Awesome
Idol since Berywam member
Simon’s face show it everything ❤
What type of music is this that he’s beatboxing
MB14 is a pro beatboxer hes in competitions all over the world
MB14 is legit a SUPER talented beatboxer and I'm glad he's getting the recognition he deserves.
Those who know mb14 knows that its not his best performance. He's got a lot more
Un talent incroyable sous côté en france. Il est unique et humble. Bonne chance mec
Будь дастоин имени бро!!!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I could pay a million dollars to watch him perform
You may not know: MB14 is a former member of the group Berywam (America Got Tallent's most viewed beatbox group)
Sans être chauvin le meilleur beatbox actuellement que je connaisse., aussi bien techniquement que artistiquement
Awesome 🤯
i am not into beatbox  but this was on another level!!!!
Sorry, but the full version of this song is TEN FOLDS BETTER. MB14 has beeen around the Beatbox scene for a while now, a true professional. Hope he gets known more now❤
I'm hearing leron leron sinta buko ng papaya 😂
MB14 and the BERYWAM ❤
GigaChad beatboxes??? 🤯🤯🤯
Lui mette  la voce ma l amplificatore e quello che la controlla e' fa tutto
He is extremely talented and very entertaining to watch
A pro footballer playing on the Sunday league
MB14 do you know clozee? fellow french woman. you need to collaborate
Ese señor es otro nivel de talento, simplemente increible
He’s gotten better since The Voice, that is talent.
When Simon make that face it means u r really good👍💥💥💥
MB14 his name is MUHAMMAD ... he is an Good Muslim sharing the positive soul ❤❤❤
been waiting MB14 since his performance of gangsta paradise!
Ive litro watched like 10 times astonishing
Esh!
MB14 x Berywam = ❤️
I like how there’s no sob story attached to this, just pure talent.
and big singers need a million studio..and this guy come from nowhere.....whit a loop station and his voice.Respect!
Thats call looping
Is this the same guy who performed some beatboxing in  Voice few years ago🤔. I think I only saw his audition then and I wonder how he did🤔
Such a great talent, knew him from The voice french. He still amazed me after long long time.
The instruments he created using his voice were sooooooo spot on. Well deserved Golden Buzzer!
WTH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥MASTER PIECE
He had his hand out at the end trying to signal “hold on” because he wasn’t done with the performance yet.
Omg this Man 🔥🔥🔥🔥🙊🙊
😮😮 omg
He's not a beat boxer. He's a looper. There's many, MANY better beat boxers.
We love u bro
Oh! First time I saw all of Simons face work he’s had done. Take a little Time to get used to
goosebumps yay
Wow❤
This man has been doing the exact same thing for 7 years now. What you’re seeing is not raw talent, it is perfection. Couldn’t be happier for where he has reached. Esh!
He is a Beatbox legend. One of GOAT
Even if he played gangsta paradise he will get golden buzzer I think
ESH!
O and don't forget to mention he's french and did the voice in france and won it absolute legend bro needs more fame on music platforms he only got 40k subs go and make it a million guys.
Hands down the best audition this show has ever seen in a long time. Well deserved Golden Buzzer
It's a big talent 🔥
Alhamdulillah he deserved it ❤🎉
Waa impresionante
Well deserved golden buzzer right there! This beatboxer is nothing like the generic type. Hes out of the box that was awesome!
In my MC Hammer voice: *Can't touch this!!*
Je suis pas un grand fan de beatbox mais lui il est bien plus que ça,  un chanteur talentueux et un type authentique qui mérite d'être mondialement connu.
Surreal top o melhor que já vi e ouvi
Where has this guy been! Phenomenal like Simons says!!!! Smashed it for life 🎉
Yoooo MB14 going crazy on the stage!!!! ‍🔥🔥🔥
amazing!
He is the best 🎉
Im watching this for like 10x a day, what a great performance 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Very similar to Tom Thum Ted Talk..
I love the music style. never heard it beatboxed before. Its really good. 👍
Such a unique audition...I think that most of us had no idea that a human can produce so many sounds...haha
MB14 is an orchestra!
I really shocked that no one heard about him, i mean Im from Turkey, even i knew MB14 since many years ago. I already was expecting huge success since he got The Voice France. BTW you need to see his performance from that show
Mohammad Salah La La La La La running down the wing😂😂👍
Ant and Dec haven’t had a golden buzzer in a couple of years. Loved that they got to do it for this 🥰❤
The best thing about him is that he laughs with his eyes
Good lord this guy is amazing. He makes that look so easy 🤯
So it's 2023 and none of these judges have never looked up loop station or heard of loop station on YouTube
Wow amazing, as man enjoy EDM this is so good 👍
Meilleur passage de sa chanson: 4:47
He stopped beatboxing and the sound continued ? Did anyone notice this hahaha
Its was soooo gooood until ads popped out
BEEN WATCHING HIM FOR YEARS ON SWISSBEATBOX
Xyloygyzy
Normal Tuesday night for MB14. He does performances like this all the time and this was just 1/1000 of his repertoire. Mans couldn't believe he actually got the Golden Buzzer doing what he does everyday.
Ce mec était déjà le meilleur et il s'améliore à chaque apparition... Mais qui peut l'arrêter????
Hey there! 😊 I think you'd do great in AGT, especially after seeing IAM TONGI 🌟 take America's Got Talent by storm this year. You could be the next big star on World's Got Talent 🌎 next year! 🌟This guy is OUTER-WORLDLY with that talent. He is so humble and beautiful. Man, I love this guy.
Can anybody tell me the backround music
Beatbox community goes hard on MB14
is he muslim
At 1:32, after meeting this guy, they had no choice but to love him as well.
I can already tell in this guy's demeanor and his smile, enlightening more smiles to come his way. Beautiful man. Can't wait to hear his talent.
OMG. This guy is JESUS. :)
Firstly is ant on the coke again and why is Bruno on this with les Dennis’s ex
Why he doing better then berywam lol
Lindo, maravilhoso com muito talento!
Man, it's so cool seeing him on such a big stage like this blowing minds. He is actually perfect for a competition like this, loopstation has endless posibilities
I love beat boxing i just hate when they have to use machines to record bits to carry on playing so they can do more, also Michel Winslow is still the sound guy goat
MB14 The King of Music
I think I’ve watched this over 100 times this week. I’m still speechless 😳
فنان 🫶🏻🎼
Qual nome da música?
Un seul mot : Waouw ❤❤❤
Masterpiece my goodness! 👏
Esh 🤙

the voice france in two sessions
You Can watch the movie Tenor. He sing inside.
Wheres BeardyMan
Worthy golden buzzer
Muito bom, Parabéns pelo talento.
Rah, i got goosebumps the whole performance. This is the definition of talent🙏🏽
My favorite Swiss Beat Box loop battle will always be the 2017 semi-final between Saro and MB14. That was a battle of two titans at the top of their game just giving it their all.
6/10
The smile makes me feel so happy for the guy. Incredible!
Esh,,,,
Legendary
Bro I watched it 4 times I a row love this man
He looks like Mo salah 😂♥️♥️

I remember him from the Tenor movie, it was great really.
Halal olsun dayi oğlu
If you can peel your eyes away from him close them,,, that’s one hell of a journey it takes your mind on…. Amazing and devilishly handsome 😉
He should meet Michael Winslow
Who thought... MB14 from the WBC would actually make it to BGT... Lol First Berywam (his old friends from France) now... MB14... Good lord.
Whoa
The Greek God of Beatboxing 🤣
Good smile is the only therapy needed
2:56 the judges' faces 🤣 The act was amazing. Bravo !
4:57 Bruno and Alesha dancing like their rents due and then there's Simon- :O
His English is getting a lot better
Missing the good old days of berywam with Mb in
Il aurait dû gagner the Voice!! C'était mon préféré
cringe why dose he move his hand like that
He has the best smile ❤
Sympathetic talent
Déjà vu ce remix y'a plus de 1 an sur canal+ dans "en aparté" + plusieurs autres émissions; dommage que les gens attendent BGT pour se manifester :) .... BRef  GG les connaisseurs en bois qui commentent :) JUL et autres rappeurs qui digit leurs voix, ils peuvent apprendre :)
I sure loved this audition
C 'est une machine ce mec , je le suis depuis ces début et il ne fait que monter en puissance 🥰🥰🥰
it's beautiful
C'est génial!  💯❣
Top bgt 😭😭😭
Que decir de MB14. Lo que diga es poco!. Es fantástico!.   Yo le sigo desde hace muchos años y es único. No es simplemente un increíble beatboxer; es eso, un extraordinario cantante y artista. Lo tiene todo y allí donde vaya arrasa.  Me alegro mucho que haya llegado hasta este programa/concurso para enseñar su increíble e inigualable talento!.  No sé que decir más!   Increíble!! Bravo MB14!.  Te mereces lo mejor! 😉👍
You will be the champion muhammad!
Nos régions ont du talent
KEREN BGTT
Oh this is brilliant
This is the best bgt golden buzzer
This guy is already a big star in France. 😅
OH my Gosh.👍⭐️👍⭐️
Is it just me or did the opening sound like Demon Slayer music?
There is a better version of this track.
Bravo MB14 toujours aussi talentueux et toujours aussi humble ... et amiénois en plus ;-)
Beardyman rip off
Pepuoni would be so proud! Much love from Beatbox Indonesia!
Je t aimeeeeee t es le MEILLEUR!!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Bravo mec ! 😎
It was such a wonderful performance 💙💙💙💙ESHHH🔥🔥
He participated in The Voice France some years ago. Didn't know he continues to try to break through...
Quite the rave
The Emperor's new clothes of "music".🙄
Oh putain de bordel de merde c'était absolument incroyable !!
esh
it not about proper talent no more its just a tv spectical
❤❤❤❤
mb14 ❤
BGT is just easy mode for MB14, just a little check in his bucket list i think :)
2.8 milion views in just 3 days.
i just love MB14, he´s such a nice and positive guy! :D and also his talent for the stage is impeccable! Hope he gets really far and maybe wins the competition!
The guys a genius
The face of Simon during the performance made my day 😂❤
He was the voice France 2016 finalist
Maybe he rushed it a little bit . Should have done like he uploaded on his channel.that would be awesome❤
Ooooohhhh yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, happy to see him here ❤❤❤❤❤
Now imagine if Saro perform in BGT or AGT
You should watch his performances in The Voice France !  He came back for the All Star Edition in France too !
What a talent!  I could hear oriental music in the background... What a mixture!  Very charming too. Loved it.
I’ve seen plenty of people do this type of performance (not on stage) but as short as it was he showcased himself very very well 👏
I also thought I'll be on the stage one day, but here I am, on my bed.
ESH
Yes MOHAMMAD is coming Goodluck bro
MB14 big ❤❤
Tellement heureuse de te revoir MB! Bravo!
Another Britain thats got talent not.
He's talented, handsome, and he's French **chef's kiss**
This is my favorite beatboxer 🙏😊
Lol it’s always the best ones who are like “I hope I get 4 yes’s”
Whats the title's of song that used for backsound
MB14 worked hard to be the guy who he is now. He ain't another beatboxer. Absolute showman. I remember his video against Saro at a beatbox championship years ago
Hyper émue ! Tu étais si souriant pdt toute la performance ! Tu le mérites vraiment ! J'espère que cela t'emmènera plus loin que The Voice😊
Masha Allah
Allez MB14 cet fois c est pour toi!!!!
So with all the negativity and stress in the world these days happy moments like this are just so heart warming and mean so much to them and to us watching even for just a few minutes 😊so nice. 🙏🥰
MB14 is da GOAT!!!
HALLAL music 😂🎶
Gaulois solide
this guy is the winner!
I think we've found our next vocal sensation and we're ready for a new "The Fifth Element" movie!!
imagine if inkie or saro went there . the world dosen"t know what loopstation artists are capable of .
Il est trop fort !!!
Congrast brother MB14
i see him in the voice
Wow!!! Damn!!! That was great!!!’ ❤
Britons got talent and he’s French so another none Brit has talent
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Je suis contente pour lui 🎉

MB14 ya se habia pasado el juego antes de ir a Got Talent xD
He played his old hit😅
MB14 beatboxer good luck
❤💗💓💯💪💪💪😍🥰🥰🤩❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Je ne connaissais absolument pas en ne regardant pas The Voice. Mais pourquoi j'ai pas entendue parler de lui purée ? Pourquoi en France on en l'entend pas ? Il est incroyable !!! J'en suis fan !!!
that was amazing. he really deserved that golden buzzer. I would pay to a full show of that.
The string and high opera notes were very well done!  Everything else seemed kind of basic.  I haven't seen much beatboxing, but I have seen far more impressive feats.  Maybe this is just unique to the show, nobody's done a good beatboxing performance yet.
IMPRESIONANTE TALENTO. NUNCA ANTES VISTO. FELICIDADES ¡¡¡¡
I watch this incredible audition every times never get tired😂❤
I mean... first time? hahah He is amazing!
Just love that guy. He is talented and extremely nice on top of it ! I had the chance to seen him live at a small festival. I am soooo happy for Mohammed. Well deserved that he get noticed outside France.
La France seulement 🎉🎉
So, Beardyman has been doing this for years. But ok. Look up " Live at the Underbelly"...
Literally been done for 15+ years. Even ed sheeran was doing this on the streets to begin with
Thom thum?
Song : Pyramids Album : MB14 Ambitus You Welcome. :)
Wait wait wait.  MB14 has also been in the voice france where He played Gangsta’s paradise. And now He is here. What a progress

My God. And now i know,his real name is 'Mohammed'. Good job MB14, good performance. You shake the world, you shake BGT23 with you music and your talent. 🎉🎉🎉🔥🔥🔥
Wow
Masyallah real name is Muhammad
Finally man! The world is slowly merging into the exposure of MB14 and the art of Beatboxing all around the world!❤❤
He's winning bgt this year
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Been oblige to change your name from Mohamed to Mb14 just to be accepted 😂
i thought this guy looked and sounded familiar so i hit a few search terms and oh my god its the same guy who beatboxed gangsta's paradise on the voice france in 2016

I'm so glad mb14 is out in the world doing what he wanted every since he left berywam. Hope he wins it all this man is one of the most talented people I've ever seen. Take the time to look him up specifically when he's with berywam a while back
The most I like of all who's been doing this.

MB14 is dope. This show sucks hard.
Seriously the judges didn't know who he is? and the audiences?  I am from Myanmar, the burning country in the revolutionary war yet I know him since long ago. My fav is still Saro though.
That is pure talent.
Incroyable ❤❤❤
Good for America, please more Mohameds
He's one of the best in the scene with the loopstation! He's a more than just a beatboxer!
My brother that was incredible. 👍👍👍
I just love those two guys backstage.  They are a riot to watch.

Trop fière de lui depuis son premier passage dans The Voice ❤
He is a legend in his genre

Simon had NEVER ever been surprised at this point before.  Bouche bée tout du long
Mb14 my idol 🔥
looking at the talent, it's amazing how the music is done..............
L'évolution depuis les battles et Berywam incroyable !
When this video poped up I thought what could it be to deserve golden buzzer but... When he started doing this magical show I understood. This is what we call TALENT!
Simon : It's one of the Great, great, great audition.  MB14 Inside : Oh Simon, I haven't even shown my 25% of the Talent yet !
My Idol beatbox....
Really i got amazed of this track in one mouth jump to dance ❤❤❤
Remember him from the french tv show version of "The Voice". Great talent indeed.
love❤
MB14 is very famous in France since his participation at The voice France in 2016 where he went in finale.  He already made a lot of tours across France and everybody loves him for years.  It’s surprising that he was not known outside France before today.
He looks so wholesome oh my God. He has the nicest smile ever🥹
He was a part of Berywam and now he is a performancer by his own. 🥲 Incredible Audition!!! ❤👍
Congrats MB14!!!!!!!
La France vous a envoyé son plus bel ambassadeur ❤ Il est aussi comédien, je vous conseille le film " Ténor " où il partage l'affiche avec Michèle Laroque. Bravo MB14, un succès a la hauteur de ton immense talent 🎉
He deserve it
this is what you called talent. not doing plunger trick shots on logos
Un mec qui vient de chez nous c'est magnifique merci Moha ❤
Does anybody know his nationality?
Beatboxers will make a difference in the music industry beatboxers FTW 🎉🎉
Ouahouuu Époustouflant 🎉🎉🎉 1 millier de je t'aime ❤
*Yeah right nothing new about the act. I bet he watches Thom thum always😆*
i could listen to this guy for a night live easily
Pure talent! Well deserved 👏🏻
Use translator because he touch so much my soul: MERCI beaucoup Mohammed, 28 ans de France !  Il est beau, sympathique, sensuel, talentueux, souriant et sexy. Il utilise tellement de variantes pour nous séduire, les oreilles et l'âme. Vraiment tout un phénomène qui éclate devant nous en toute simplicité. malgré le 'Golden Buzzer' et les 4 commentaires des juges, il reste humble et généreux !  BIG kisses of gratitude from Gatineau, QUÉBEC ... XOX
he could sing opera on his own no problem with this voice
Without audio Technology his nothing😂
Been watching this like a million times today.. He is very talented, wonderful, amazing, fantastic, stunning and everything and yes his hair is very nice owhh now I'm a huge fan.. I wish he gonna win this season.. ❤️❤️❤️
MB14 , legend. The reason I started beatboxing ❤
the definition of talent
he finally got the recognition he deserves after all he's attempts in major talent shows...
Nu am vazut ceva mai frumos!
❤❤❤
He's also a former member of Berywam.
Glad to have followed him long wayyy before. He really deserves that golden buzzer. People need to hear more of his creations 🔥
MB14 😭😭😭
Just when you think BGT has run it’s course you get something like this.  Amazing performance, I’m pretty sure Amanda was very taken with him 😂
Wow!! Absolutely amazing, flawless, genius!!❤❤❤🎉
He has tremendous charisma, which is the special gilding one his fabulous talent. 🎉🎉
J adore ce mec, c est un diamant brut !!! 💎😍😉
Mois international

PAPA PG similar
How was the sound coming through even when he took the Mic completely away from he's mouth
👏 MB14 la dinguerie 🔥🔥
Little judge don't know he was the main core of BERYWAM sheeeeeesh
one man show for sure

MB14!!!
You're legend and better than berrywam i love you since 5 years  Congratulations 🎉
His smile is just absolutely infectious.
common mb14 W
I feel quite happy to see him performing again and showing in my YouTube homepage 😆  Anyway it's been so long since I saw him perform, I thought he quit entertainment / music industry
OMG ❤❤❤❤
I just watched this 4 times. This guy is really multi talented. His channel also has quite the content. Hope he wins BGT.
I think I was a strict follower of MB14 for 4 years or more. I was shocked and very happy to see him on this stage. MB14 is already a legend, it has become a bigger legend now.
I am french and ashamed to say that I didn't know him and his amazing talent....  a friend of mine sent me this video and I had goosebumps listening to his voice, such that I must admit my eyes got a little bit teary to see the reactions of people listening to him.  He deserves their applause and I join mine! Bravo!!!! 👏👏👏
I recognized him fron the Voice... in one of the highlights i saw when he did Gangstas Paradise by Coolio.... RIP Coolio. May he rest in piece.
Le boss 🇨🇵🇨🇵🇨🇵
as someone who loves the beatboxing scene, seeing him on such a big stage and people loving his artform was so wholesome. MB14 gonna bring light to such a great music form.
This year's winner!!!
About time some recognition was given!
Nonsense
It's cool how tech can make u sound like that😂
You are amazing bro i love it
👏👏👏
MB14 le boss français 🇫🇷
Suka musiknya tapi udah bosan itu Mulu jir di bawain setiap live emang ngga ngeluarin lagu baru bang.?
BERYWAMに復帰して欲しい
Looks like Kylo Ren
trop contente pour lui !! déjà énorme dans the voice france, et vraiment touchant dans le film "ténor" j'espère qu'il va conquérir les anglais est aller en finale
The SOUL is beating !!!
Is he the dude from French Got Talent few years back?
People that weren’t aware of MB14 before this, go and watch MB14 vs Saro. It’s considered one of the greatest beatbox loop station battles of all time, for good reason.
Plot twist : he is a superstar in France ahahahhaha
Such an incredible performance yet I'm so upset that the video ads play in the midst of the performance. Can't get any more annoying.
Bravo MB14!! Tu mérites tout ce qui t’arrives , c’est génial !!!!
why do I feel sexy when I imagine dancing to it 😂
MB14 always makes an audition to be his own concer ❤
4:27 is straight 🔥
🇲🇰🇲🇰🇲🇰🏅🥇🏅
amputek ang pogi
Amazing talent 🔥
You're Absolutely Incredible Mohammad, best wishes 🎉
Another great loop artist If you want more brilliance check out Sam Perry from the  Voice Australia 2018
Just a very cool dude
There was Susan Boyle and Kody Lee's audtion. Now there is MB14. He his not only a beatboxer, he also has an incredible voice.
He was one of the founders of the group Berywam, but he turned his attention to individual activities
John Krasinski???
is it just me or does he look a tad bit like a younger version of John Travolta during his hay days?! Remarkable talent MB14...definitely going places 👏👏👏
If only he could rap
Quel tueur ! He got the fire !
Beardyman I think is an excellent beatboxer.
Amazing! People still beat box in 2023
Omg i'm so proud of him i'm french and follow him since his audition on The Voice he's just so talented and an incredible singer too!
Omg omg bro🎉
Bravo ! Un niveau supérieur encore à ce que j'avais vu sur The Voice qui m'avait pourtant déjà scotché à l'époque !
ghostbump
People like him are the reason I love this show 🎉
very sexy😊
Hes not human
mindblowing
He is gorgeous. I'm going to France 😉
From berywam and now mb14 solo omg
I just saw jesus totally creeped out. Not the angel. I am Jewish. It was that I saw jesus on the cross no I know he is real. It was the guy in the shiny, gold jacket. Urgh. Honestly gross. Love you mb14.
the judges only seen his angel side, none of them seen the devil side that shown in the battle when he elemenate his opponents😈
This guy is very well known in France, for a few years now. It's quite funny that the whole world is discovering him only today.
🔥🔥🔥
Amazing
gooooooooooosebumpss
Do not and i cant stress this enough. DO NOT let this mans tongue ANYWHERE near your girl 🤣😂
He is a good actor iykyk
Funny fact is That for gbb level this performance is medicore :D congrats for Golden buzzer
Great talent...does not hurt that he is hot! Ask Alecia about his hair.
he's the person, the guy, the man that make me jump into the beatbox community
Oh My LORD! He SO AMAZING. Well deserved golden.
mb14 did more than educate us in  beat boxing,,, he left nothing but genuine joy in that theater... and in all of the homes who stumbled across this video, thank you   i had just ran out
Extraordinary talent. Congratulations on the Golden buzzer ❤😊
This guy raps, sings, do beatbox, acting too (French movie called "Tenor", watch it, very good movie). He's gonna smash it to the finals for sure ! He's already known in our country, hope you guys feel this pure talent. What a surprise to see him here ! I'm so happy for him
imagine if SO-Flo went on here he would get the diamond buzzer! SO-FLO is the best beatboxer in the game ever
Can anyone tell me mb14 is a Muslim or not
Arab man
my guy is sooo humble after pulling that off🤯😱🥶
Those who didn't know. he was former Berywam member
Ici en France ils sont aigris, ils ont laissé passer un talent comme lui, tant pis pour eux et j'espère qu'il fera carrière la bas 😊
i thought it was done before, i think Saro should compete too
💯👌💫🙏🙌👁👁
As I grew up I realized how annoying the judges cuts are like let us enjoy the act and shut up 😂😂
Ayyooo a fellow man bun bearded Mohamad 💪🏼🔥🔥😂
Je comprends pas que ce mec est pas plus connu.... Il est trop fort MB14!! Et ds "tenor" juste fantastique et emouvant !!! CE FILM m as scotché !!
MB14 has the purest voice

Automatic disqualification. The show is called Britains got talent, not the worlds got talent.
THAT IS LEGEND.  Magic of the soul and spirit and ...  MAN ... THIS IS HUGE..
MB14...OMG❤❤❤
i've ever heard this music, but where?
Simon's eyes be like 🤑
Reminds me a lot of Beardyman, beatboxing samples into a loop and improvising on top.
He's incredibly amazing, he's one of my favorite loop player❤
Brilliant!
Beatboxer and a looper. Now this is what music now is like.
Super cool
we are proud of you Mohammed, well done.
He's ready now to rock the world!!!!!!! He's still so talented after all these years!! I'm so happy for him🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
He is incredible
Amazing beatboxing jesus christ

He also participate at the Voice France 2016😆😆😆 he was one of my faves🥰😍
Great voice and amazing control.. would love to hear him sing what he feels will free him even more..
Il y a eu Guillaume le Conquérant... et puis MB14 !

Bravo MB14 J'ai beaucoup aimé... Golden Buzzer mérité... Simon Cowell scoché... bouche bée ! ... et semble même désarçonné... Tout le jury dépassé... Et le public enchanté... Encore bravo MBé...

A part of me wants to say MB14 won the gold buzzer just to flex on the berywam group.

Man I’m huge fan of this guy. He is so incredible talented just wow
To be honest, this is the very first time in my life, that I could not even clap, because I was too amazed, and in too much awe and disbelief of what my ears were hearing. This guy is from another planet.
Tenor buena audicion
Le meilleur, toujours aussi incroyable...et il n'a pas encore vraiment chanté. Le talent à l'état pur ❤️🎉. Bravo MB14 !!!
I wonder why he left berywam
Après the voice France , pas étonnant que MB14  soit golden buzzer tu es un ténor 😉
Amazing performance, I only wish they didn't have to cut it and showed more of it instead of the reactions.
that's a real one man band
guy has allready been on France got talent and came in second , he was also on agt all-stars,  its a con , they knew who he was
He's got a good accent for a french
Mohamed ❤
I'd buy his CD!
Why do people watch this crap?

Couldn't remember his age 😂😂😂 just like the rest of the rapeugees coming in
Even level of beat boxing is down really now 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Wutang clan and Saian supa crew  Please what is that thing really  It's not beat box and it's boring
🇲🇫🇲🇫🇲🇫👑
Encore une masterclass de MB14 !!! Congratulations !
Ptdrrr il fou quoi la 😂 trop stylé
Absolutamente espetacular 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Vive la France ! C’est un grand talent de the voice France . Et de plus son film est extraordinary
Tomtumb beatbox did it years ago
Wow I love it, nd he is so cool and handsome
uncultured Simon does not know MB14 :D
Pure genius. Fortunately MB14 is already recognized in France. It would be a shame not to have dedicated him before the beautiful international recognition that awaits him now.
He better win
Absolutely, amazingly, incredible!!! Wow!! Just wow!!
I know this talented man very well since the days of gbb and swiss beatbox. He really has a great talent.
Damn
21st century electronic junk
Tu as la classe mon ami ❤❤❤
Simon, where you've been lol MB14 is one of the greats! Eshh
That's beautiful ❤️
Go watch his the voice france audition, toute mon admiration depuis le liban ❤❤
The guy has been my crush since his first appearence on the voice france ❤
Absolutely amazing never seen anything like it
was viele nicht wissen  seine stimme ist über das Mischpult auch gepicht   aber richtig gut gemacht
Je suis de la côte d'ivoire 🇨🇮mais je le suis depuis the voice jusqu'à maintenant et je peux dire que cette audition est la meilleure des meilleures que j'ai jamais vu de lui... J'étais tellement heureuse quand je l'ai vu que j'ai même pleuré de joie quand j'ai vu les animateurs débarquer sur scène 🎉❤❤🎉
Omg I saw him on Swissbeatbox and now he's here!
It’s so strange, every time I see a golden buzzer video, my hayfever starts!🥹🥹🥹
Trop fière de notre MB14 💯
damn i had to watch it twice cuz the first time i left my jaw hanging so low and  I was too blown away to concentrate
Tu l'as eu ta revanche sur the voice ! Et en plus tu as progressé de ouffff magique unique talentueux un monstre de génie musical
MB14 ,he's one of the best beatbox Loopers,over 95M views in The voice,..I love this man..
MB14  is the greatest beatbox champion I've ever seen. He was the life of Berywarm BGT is lucky to have him.
Absolutely loved his beatbox style and what a genuine, talented musician. So, nice to see a new talent that is completely different that will hopefully revolutionise the music industry. I forsee many popular artists wanting to collaborate with him.
I'm AT 26
The most talented and successful beatboxer ever
Vas yyyyyyyyyy!!! Puissannnnceee!!!! Mets le feu!!
Bravo MB, c'est un génie il mérite vraiment ce qu'il lui arrive grace à ces efforts biensur. J'espère de tout coeur qu'il gagnera ce BGT de cette année inchallah🤲🏼 En lui souhaitant encore plein de succès 🙏🏼
Take my gold... take it all...
Damn, i really enjoyed that performance, but what the hell is going on with famous people looking like oompa loompa's lately? All of them are full of botox and plastic surgery except for Alesha. Naturally aging and getting rimples is a lot more beautiful than whatever those 3 judges have going on.
I’ve got a feeling he’s going to win this years show. 😊
Mb14 is something else. I love you my dude🎉🎉🎉🎉
Mohammed he is moroccan arabian ❤
MB14 😍😍🥰❤❤
ESH !!!!! :D
what song plays at the end of the video?
To all ppl who don't nkow the mb14 and especially the bgt fan's. This man gonna blow your minds,and you are so lucky to have him in bgt this year. Watch all his performances and enjoy it,cuz none of others performances giving you what he delivers.
Proud of him 💜
and I cant even whistle properly lol
Очень люблю наблюдать за Саймоном, за его искренние сопереживания выступающим, искренние удивление, восхищение и улыбу😘🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
He was the member of berywam. The beat boxer group that has the most views on AGT history. It was expected if you watch swiss beat box or you just follow beat box
Dude is a walking studio 🤯
Une performance incroyable, un jury dithyrambique, juste la grande classe monsieur MB14 ! Je vous souhaite le meilleur pour la suite.
What a perfect loopstation performance! Hugest ups to MB14 for bringing beatboxing to the mainstream! This can gladly take over as the «Insane beatbox at a talent show»!
How do they not know MB14
Rubbish-thats the end of bgt ....is there really no talent left in the UK.
Its fkn MB14 😂😂 whats he doing there
Aller MB14 !! Rend nous fier 🫡
No doubt he's one of the most talented participants in this show, but his character is so unique and that what makes him so special! A STAR!
Il a enfin la visibilité et le publique qu'il mérite.
Wow this is magician 🎩
I just feel this was prepared in advance , i am almost sure all of it was planned
The Best

Goosebumps  He is amazing 🙌🙌
MB14 is a great talent. Just hope that Saro won't show up in BGT 😂
Mb14 cest d'origine algérien donc même le son cest arab

Bravo ! Mb14

Still wanted Blobby to get it.
C est emplement mérité  Et pour embarqué Simon il faut être très bon ....et là, c est top
MB14 Was asked to appear on the show, he is well known in France, he was promised the Golden Buzzer for appearing... He is NOT just some guy wanting to be on BGT. he was ASKED to appear on it.....!!  The show is to a certain extent FIXED.....
Briliants got talent 🔥
Is it just me or does he look a lot like  a young John Travolta? Incredible talent!! Cannot wait to see his next performance.
Il a beaucoup beaucoup de talent ,tres humble,cerise sur le gâteau,il est très beau ❤
Thanks to MB14 this will surely be pushing beatboxing to another level ❤ beatbox is life 🧬
We in the beatbox community have seen MB14's journey ever since. To us he is a beatbox legend. Finally seeing him on this stage representing beatbox, showing his passion, his talent, and his love for music, makes me really proud. He really deserves it. ESH!
Wow... Really 🎉 amazing! Humble, talented guy 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👌🏼🙏🏼🥇🏆
Wow what a great Talent 😮 this is truly amazing
mohammed is so great i hope he wind
Awesome. I just would like if audience didn't intrude with constant clapping and yelling, because its rude and annoying to do in middle performance.
MB14 the best, Simon's compliment by itself was a golden buzzer ❤️🙏🙌
Woooooou this audition will change his life. 🤟🤟🤟🤟🖐🖐
is he gangster's paradise dude?
What you don't realise is that wasn't even Ed Sheeran at the end, man was still doing his act
Vive MB14, continue de prendre ton pied et fais nous rêver
فحلي قسم بالله تستاهل البز الذهبي
I could genuinely listen to this for hours and hours. Every time I play this, I rack the volume up to 100! makes me want to dance  every time 😍
Ce mec a un talent fou. C'est le Goldman du BeatBox, il arrive à populariser une discipline à la base très exclusive et à la faire apprécier au plus grand nombre. Et que dire de la compo ! Avec ses inspirations des quatres coins du monde et ce mélange des genres, on voyage et ça fait du bien. Hâte de voir ta prochaine prestation !
He's so talented and soo fit.❤❤❤
The legend is here! MB14!!!

Probably  the coolest  thing I've ever heard.

He nailed it
04:53  Simon look ! Plus que fière de toi MB14, quel homme talentueux !!! 🎉🎉🎉
Ce gars est un génie ! La première fois que je l'ai vu à The Voice France, j'ai ADORÉ ! C'est le seul à me faire adorer le BeatBox ! Amplement mérité ce golden buzz, je veux trop un album de MB14 !
Brilliant!
Once again a great performance ruined by stupid crowd and judge shots.
BRAVO MB14 (que de progrès depuis the Voice) pour ce golden Buzzer tout à fait mérité 👋🤩
What amazes me is that there is a lot of hidden talent in the world. But why do they never get a break? I'm more than certain that he has done a lot of shows in clubs. You would think that someone would have discovered him, and help him set up a permanent career. He was excellent.
Damn i’ve known his Blind Audition on The Voice FR, Gangsta’s Paradise maybe, just accidentally search his performance 5 mins ago but i found this. Really surprised that he chooses to participate in BGT and got a Golden Buzzer. Great job man 👏🏻 from Vietnam with love 🇻🇳.
He's cute to the core.. I thought he's in is late 30s wow!
A beautiful soul!
so good to see professional beatboxers showing their talent to the world on got talent stages… hopefully many more get there too..
Everytime I see a beatboxer on a stage this big where the audience is so oblivious to beatboxing and get their minds blown makes me so happy XD I can assure y'all that every beatboxer, including me, are rejoicing at this time. We want the beatbox community to be known in the mainstream side of things and this is such a nice moment in history!
How cool and handsome he is.
It would be considerate to put M14's name in the title of this video... Like other contestants in other videos.  A bit irritating that the title of this video doesnt even have his name in it, and Ant and Dec are the main subjects of the youtube thumbnail... The person with the talent should be. They did all the hard work. Not the person who pressed a buzzer
I love loopers... When i saw the machine I was so excited, but I had no idea what I was in for. This guy is absolutely unique, and a legend. So excited to see what will happen. ❤ so much talent
❤❤❤ MB 14 tu es le meilleur ! BRAVO ❤❤❤
Wow❤❤❤ awesome
😯😯😯 Now that isTalent, BRILLIANT...Speechless!!! 🩷🩷🩷
O ho
Yeah he's good but nothing compared too the kiddys on the beat box battle wildcards, they do full songs with there voices in one go.. not copy and replay it on a machine
goosebumps from 3:47 😮🙀🔥
He began in the voice france a few years ago
Bravo mohammed algerian
Sam Perry is better I say
Any and dec get your money and run 🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️Britain got talent days are well over it’s finished it’s so same same that’s just my opinion. It’s like Simon getting old 🙈🙈🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤫🤫🤫
If this guy doesnt win it all ill be pissed
MB14 is a professional beatboxer.... BGT should be for people that dont do it for a living.  He has been doing competitions all over the world. He was a finalisr for the grand championship for beatboxingin 2017 and The Voice in 2016.  He should not be on this show... no matter how amazing he is as he is a professional
It's cool🥶🥶🥶
This legend will bring beatboxing back 😊
legend ❤️
Amaaaaaazingggg!!! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
MB14 ❤❤❤
❤
If you wanna listen to more of MB14, check his LA CUP performance, it's wonderful.
MB14 the genius love ❤  from sri lanka 🇱🇰 .
Seriously , who the hell didnt know in 2023 who is this guy ? Congratulations , I follow you since the beatbox battles
Simon thinking who is the actual music producer on the venue
great way to make beatbox even more popular
Dans le film tenor tu es formidable
He doesn’t need berywam 😂
MB14 is the Eminem for the beatboxer world.
Damn!
Just WOW!
Acompanho esse cara a anos, é incrível ver sua evolução 🇧🇷🇧🇷
Defo wasn’t a golden buzzer act. Seen better
bonjour 🥐🥖
Well he just mixed few different sounds ive seen a beatboxer on a yt he drives taxi and does beatboxing and that guy has got some next level bb skills.
Man say’s everything you hear is my voice, halfway through aleisha gets with the program 😏
pretty handsome～
Trop fier de lui ! Enfin le monde va découvrir son talent ! 🥳💪
🔥🔥🔥🔥
thaks
Je n'aime pas être fan des artistes. Mais pour lui c'est une obligation. Un talent incroyable.
Thats not a performance that is a SHOW pay him asap.
The Beatbox community is very proud of you MB14 thank you for showcasing this amazing art form 🔥🔥🔥🔥
“I don’t know where you’ve been”  He was already on the Voice and got 95m views.
Is it the same what he showed on the voice?
That’s so cool
I thought famous people weren't allowed to enter BGT?
BeryWam of AGT
REMINDS ME OF GRANT THUMB WHEN HE FIRST APPEARED ON TED TALK.
Wtf mb14
imagine this track in the movie.. damnn.. it would be fun..
MB14🔥
It's cool watching them see MB14 for the first time even though he's been a beatbox legend for a long time now. Glad he's getting more out there.
Love berywam and mb14
He should become a big Composer in the world 🌎
Simon the show is done give him the mullah
Bruno I don't like him
This man beat boxing in 2050
This was epic !!!!
Bravo MB14🥰🥰🥰🥰
Best thing I have ever heard! Ever!
only SARO can beat him 😂
Nothing like seeing someone with actual talent getting the golden buzzer 👏🏼
My favourite beatboxer MB14
Il a mis le feu!! 😮😮,j'adore 😁😁
Magical, unbelivable and simply and just wonderfuld
The Swiss beatbox community supports you all the way MB14!!!
France ± crossint ❤❤❤❤❤❤
I'd like to see the old berywam in bgt
He’s so amazing and so adorable 🎉
this is not a BEATBOXING this is a pièce of art
I wish YouTube had more than just one like
Bravo à toi MB14! Chanteur, musicien, arrangeur, créateur, rappeur, acteur... Tellement de talent chez une seule personne!
- MB14 is a former of Berywam (beatboxing group they were in AGT 2019).  - World champion with Berywam 2018 - He can sing very well, he went through finals in The Voice France by singing - Got role in a film
Bien vu frerot ....tu dechire
If you like him, check out Sam Perry too
Wats the last gold buzzer to give Out
Il n'a pas peur de l'echec
Amiens est si fier de toi MB !!!❤
Funny seeing berywam killing it on AGT now mb14 on BGT knowing that the M in berywam stands originally for mb14 haha happy for them and the beatbox community as a whole.
He is a starrrrrr he should winnnnn the show defffo😊❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
1:35 he changes his fake smile instantly... weird lol
Un diamant à l'état brut.... Je kifffff
Here is a little fact. MB14 was a part of berywam,it was Beatness,Rythmind,Wawad and MB14. hence the name BeRyWaM,and beasty replaced him after he left the crew. he is also one of the best looper in the beatboxing community
Mb14 is my favorite in beatbox and music that is true king of music.. Good job my king ❤🎉 we love you and support you 👍
At first idk who he is, once he said "im MB14" man i laughed so hard because suddenly recall this dude from random beatbox video i watch long ago.
Absolutely amazing xxxx
Someone with actual talent on this show for a change
I've never seen Simon so shocked!
Bravo MB14 ❤❤🎉🎉
MB14 was once part of BERYWAN <3
yeah very nice mb14, salute👏👏👏👏
THAT IS TALENT⭐️
Wow, this is brilliant!
So GOOD 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Berywam member
MB14 thank you for doing this, you are showing the non beatboxer world what beatbox has become, you're a gamechanger because beatbox (and looping) is finally getting the publicity that it deserves
I was on a trance during his performance. He made me think I'm an arabic princess from an utopian multiverse.
Start the beat: 02:47 Thanks me later~
I think Simon was not ready for this
Wow! Pure Talent! A band unto himself! Wow! Truly awesome. Simon is right, how come we haven't heard of him all this time! Phenomenal with nice hair!!!
Nice quality sound and camera
Beyond talent🥰🥰oooh my God..he real real deserved it.
MB 14 as he leaves, inside his head: " You like that? I'm going to blow your minds next time. "
So.. where's David?
i dont think he is done already, he still got something to show, he told the crowd to calm down a little bit so he can continue to deliver something more. but the crowd already gone crazy, he cant stop it 😅
Hi
I know someone who can sing opera while doing beatbox without a machine or device..
6:30 = Goosebumps!
Boleh boleh mb14.... Solo karir ni padahal
wait how come we able to comment on BGT  videos. 🤣
What a gorgeous and so talented beatboxer 😅
Kesini gara2 tiktok😂
MB14 is maestro 👏👏👏
Thats is wonderful.  New star is born Thankyou so much for giving us amzing show
that the effect he give to everyone when they hear him for the first time
i remember when mb14 battled b-art. he was excellent
Dear Beatboxers… Your attendance…Esh!
Omg I’m crying happy tears..he’s so deserving of that!!!!
Ur talent its really really amazing, likes a ur real name Mohammed. Stay strong & shine brother likes a prophet Muhammad ✨
Agree with the audience member - when I see performers like MB14, my first thought is I am so happy for them. Well done!
Insane
je me souviens de son passage à The voice France, c'était toujours aussi sensationnel. il a gardé son sourire et son humilité...BRAVO MB14
I’m so proud of you MB14 love all of the stuff you do!!
But with hip hop and beatboxing twists, amazing work bro
Low-key kind of sounds like Indian music!😂
Proud to you Mohamed ❤❤❤
You make the beatbox community proud mb14 You deserved that ESH🔥
Didn’t Wolverhampton pay Ruben Neves enough wage ?😂😂😂
This was just a little teaser from him😂
So well deserved
Damn i love mb14 he's in my top 3 of my favorite loopers
This was so cool bro
Ahhhh bravo, il le mérite !!!
That's really talent
❤🎉
Masha Allah Muhammad
Bravo👏👏👏👏❤😍🇩🇿
Many probably never heard of him before, but he's such a great beatboxer and has huge talent! I highly recommend watching his audition in the Voice France, he even made it to the finals there (but I think he didn't win unfortunately). He has an incredible voice that's for sure. And for those of you who don't know, he was one of the founding members of Berywam, but left them years ago. There's also an audition from him with Berywam in an italian show (not the voice I believe). What an amazing dude, I'm so glad he finally came to a got talent show to show his talent to everyone!
Alicia Dixon is quite possibly the most irritating woman about... any time a beat drops she goes all like gangster and starts acting like she's about 13
Bro is either Moroccan or Algerian
This is my boy💜
French style
Simon s face  is even more amazing than the audition Can t be more swallen
Best audition I’ve ever seen..
Prince of beatbox
Oh my god, I don't discover him now, but he's so exceptional, I watched the video three times and cried all way long. Very bright demonstration of some of his talents!
Wow just wow😮😮😮
Respect 🙏🙏 ❤❤
Great job Mohammed
It was such a long time since the last time I saw he smiles all the time and smiles so hard,so shine like that
He earned it and deserve 100%
I need this guy to win this bgt... What a humble beautiful soul
He has elevated beatboxing.
Excellent work ,,talent woww
Mb14 legend of beatboxing ❤
Don’t forget he also is an opera singer, not just beatbox.
Bro is the younger brother of GigaChad😅
AMAZING...The BEST of the BEST.
Pure Talent, not sad story not anything, just talent and golden buzzer!!!
Absolutely zero support for you
bravo mb14 super  audition
He as a very good chance of winning Britain’s go talent
Congratulation Mb14🎉🎉
Michael Winslow the second
Ill preface this with saying, yes hes good at what he does, BUT, what hes doing isnt actually beatboxing. Beatboxing at its core is using no equipment to help. Hes using a sound board to reverberate and replay his sounds, thats not what beatboxing is. You look up any professional beatboxer and youll see them making all this same sound while using nothing but a microphone and nothing else. So yes while hes good at what he does, its not exactly beatboxing. Again, you can just go watch pretty much any other beatboxer and see they use absolutely no other equipment.
Mb14 😭😭😭😭
He deserves that golden bazzer. Mr Simon was so surprised. Well done
Wheres David
GOKS
One of the best "loopers" in the world,  and he is french. Congratulations.
On aura attendu longtemps avant que tu arrives dans cette émission. Manque plus que berywam pour faire votre groupe au complet
Haha beatboxing takes me right back to being 13/14 in the early noughties!
Salam mon frère, je viens de voir que tu es parti en Angleterre. J'espère que tu gagneras la compétition! je te souhaite le meilleur et souhaite la réussite dans tout ce que tu entreprendras! bon courage!
Encore une merveilleuse performance, tout ton travail est récompensé, bonne continuation 👏😍🙏
They didn't know anything about MB14?? He was being too humble. That's one of the wonders of the world. He is a The best musical loop station  artist for me. He battled solo, with loopstation, even with his group Barywam, even participated many music shows as a singer. He is creating "total music" by himself. Not just sounds and beats, true music. And that's the best routines of MB14, pyramid is by far one of my most fav piece of music I've ever heard. I mean he didn't had the time to get to the rap part. He was about to rap and people were amazed before that.
Après toutes ces années de galères et d'acharnements, une évolution remarquable pour un talent unique. Mérité !
wish you will win this BGT2023 bro...MB14. He is super talented.
That was SICK I got goosebumps, and he so soooo handsome🫠
From GBB to BGT
simon loked shocked when ant and deck came out
Hahahah, Lost somewhere, apparently joined this audition. Very good!
What an incredible performance!
So handsome 😊
This alien will control the world
Happy to see and old favorite winning this!
I just wish they would get rid of and and dec.....I cannot stand their 'input'.
mb14 is a GOAT since day 1.
Wow!
mb14 vs saro only
And another star is born, man I couldnt possibly sit still listening to that, whens his album out ;-)
BGT you just know when there getting golden buzzer ruins it
Mb14 is the God of the music
Some one needs to hire this guy for the next halo theme song
Where has he been? More like where have you been. Everyone knows who mb14 is 😁
This is an amazing sample of a very good use of hi tech, combining with talent 👍
Lol. Hes just playing every single beat then record it like sandwich toppings.Dunno why a lot of u cheers for him. I would be impressed if he does it with his whole mouth w/o the recorder/amplifier thing.😑
who remembers mb14 vs saro
Great talent, should become a live Dubstep DJ. Absolutely infamous
I just think its crap tbh
Everything is made with his voice and he starts off the synth before he starts singing 😂
if you know the shortcut, you just press 3 to replay his performance coz i just did it 10x lol Awesome performance! 💯
He is a champion 😉👍🏻🤍
Who is the perverted old judge......made me sick
Why ain't no one talking Abt how he's fine asf 😂ngl😂
I've been getting high from him for a year now
🔥
He is ex berywam
حلك لو فرقه هذا
The charisma of MB14 is unreal ❤.
Moi qui l'ai découvert dans The Voice, j'en ai eu les larmes aux yeux T-T Il le merite tellement <3
Simon can't even smile anymore lol
It's really Cool ❤
Mb14 لقد ابدعت اتمنى لك حظ موفق في قادم الايام 🎉
The Best. Le meilleur. 最好的. Die beste. Më e mira. ከሁሉም ምርጥ. Լավագույնը. الأفضل.  Najbolji.  सर्वश्रेष्ठ.  Ka ʻoi aʻe.  ...  Beat boxer in the world.
Simon was so flabbergasted
MB14 :  1. Beatbox Legend/Champion  2. Has his own movie 3. The Voice France Finalist 4. A beatboxer that got a Golden Buzzer
Merci  pour le GOLDEN BUZZER! Vraiment Top Mb14 Félicitations...Bien mérité
the title of what he interpreted is called "Pyramides" and it is one of his personal compositions
I want this as my ringtone lol
Everybody deserves 10 minutes of glory in his/her life. He worked for it!
A Fact:  MB14 was a member of Berywam
What type of music is that is it Egyptian or Arabic?
Absolutely brilliant hope he wins may I add he’s 🔥🔥🔥🔥 too 👌🏻
Alhamdulilah
From gbb to the world stage ❤❤
Love the middle eastern twist on this, beautiful combination of sounds. If you like this then go check out Tom Thum, especially his Beatbox Battle Showcase and Ratchet Face performance with the  Queensland Symphony Orchestra.
Mb14 ma boy u deserve it ✊️🔥🔥
how dos he do that
Fantastic .Incredible .Like so much.
My man is back only legends know mb14
Like Simon said: PHENOMENAL! I'm still on the floor, I've no clue about how he did that! Not to mention that he looks like a Hollywood star, it's very commercial material. Deserved that golden buzzer!
He was incredible on the French voice
ESH
I've been up on this kat for a few years. He's definitely nice with his
Un jeune Amiénois qui met les pieds en Angleterre pour littéralement scotché nos amis de l'autre côté de la manche... Un talent digne des plus grands de ce monde, bravo MB14 👍❤️
Ostia esto es lo que hace grisson de la resistencia!!!!!
Of course!! He was a member of BERYWAM!!!
berywamもmb14もどっちも頑張っててすき berywamを抜けたmb14がberywamももらえてないゴールデンブザーもらうのがドラマ感じていい(berywamの方が下とかそういうことではないよ。berywamも大好きだよ)
He is from another planet👌
MB14
He is great.. But Im surprised that Simon acted he didn't know him..  🤷🏻‍♂️ MB14 was part of the beatboxing crew that auditioned in AGT few years back..
Mb14 please say word
Wow i didn't expect to see him here that's amazing ! Golden buzzer well deserved ! I saw him in my own town in south of France a couple months ago and i had the chance to talk to him a little and he is not only a great artist but a very cool guy ! A lot more people will hear from him !
BeatBox another level..😮
wtf really really cool 🔥🔥
Something it makes me feel proud to be french. Particularly when is see MB14 or those others beatboxers like Brez, Wawad, Beatness or Rythmind killin' it like that
that's was not audition. its a concert 😲🔥
2023 winner 😱😱
Mb14 is de better in all the word
berrywam and mb14 in shows like these is 🔥
Put ur seat belts people. He will blow ur mind...lesss goooo Momo 🔥
MB14 É FDA PRA CARALHO
there is this guy doing exactly this on the streets everywhere. Not the same guy for sure, but also very nice to see. Cant remember his name at the moment.....
MB14 goat!! 🔥❤
I know mb14 almost 2 years and now hes win bgt weww thats amazing he make beat box can be fenomenal
Non seulement, tu es un bel artiste, mais en plus une très bonne personne ne change jamais MB14 reste la personne humble que tu es. ✌🏻🥰🙏🏻
I am not a muslim and His real name is Muhammad. What a beautiful name.
Magnifique
U r killer bro @mb14
Simon's face at 4:54 xD , Priceless.
he is so talented
Finally one of the greatest talents alive receive the deserved recognition
i remember this beat MB14 vs THORSEN
Thia is not a beatbox talent, this is MAGIC!
MB14 is making the french and world beatbox community so proud, what an amazing musician
Super toujours autant de talent j'en ai eu des frissons je suis sur que la suite n'est que meilleurs 😊
Suhu mulai turun gunung...MB14 siap jadi juara go talant 2023
"The world has VERY LITTLE talent" should be the name for this program. As for them giving him their golden buzzer, WHAT A WASTE!!!!
Let go guys yes  ❤ 🤑
Il nous a tellement bien représenté. Bravo mb14. En France nous l'aimons énormément. Ne nous le voler pas hein😂
Amazing voice! Great beat box performance.
MB14 YUSSSSSSS
😍
Mb14 my man, I've been following him for years, he deserves everything and more 🙏🙏🙌🙌👏👏👏👏
MB14 FINALLY DID BGT 💯💯💯
Absolutely incredible!
Top of the beatbox...mb14 is definitly elite looper / beatboxmaker...
If you don't know MB14 then you guys have no idea what you guys have gotten into! It'll be a muscial paradise in BGT this year! :D Been following this man for more than 7 or 8 years now! Love his work <3
Congratulations mohameddd🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️🤩🤩
6:25 im crying 😭
Bro Literally Composed a Music🥶
Muy merecido me encanto mucho talento
Finally the GOAT of music arrives and the world will see a whole package of classic, rap, beatbox, looper, singer all in one. No mercy points, pure talent, genius
They should just wait then. In my opinion this is just a basic introduction of MB14. The man is amazing.
Mohammed's talents and his smile, my brother have everything amazing 👏
Smashed it out of the park!
In summary, a gift to sing as much opera as Rap and reproduce the sound of any instrument and to build with this a known or more personal piece of music
Everything about him is beautiful ❤
Le talent reconnu à sa juste valeur 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏🙏🙏🙏
Mb14 is a beatbox god
U rock Mohammed bravoooo🎉🎉
Croissant baguette 😂🔥🇨🇵
deserve golden buzzer!!
Anybody who knows MB14 saw him coming onto the stage already got the knowledge it would be a mad audition 🤩
How is that even happening like ive heard some major beatbixing before but the sounds this guy was making is unreal 🤯
Un monstre MB14 🔥🔥 Il a retourné le plateau avec cette presta, alors imagine avec celle d'En aparté 😍
Alisha your fakeness makes me cringe
I have been following MB14 for years. Great performer and awesome talent. But I have to say i dont agree with him being on BGT. hes an established artist with a lot of success. Like many performers that have already been somewhere i think the the show should be about those that haven't. Same as Malaki, trawl youtube and hes already a known name (and rightly so)...
This guy is simply phenomenal. This is TALENT PURE raised to levels of extreme joy. A PHENOMENON
Damn really proud watching him reaching this level is just wow
Go pour le référencement du meilleur
ကိုယ်ကြိုက်တဲ့ Beatboxerတစ်ယောက်က Loopstationနဲ့ ဒီလို GOLDEN BUZZERရသွားတော့ အရမ်းပျော်နေမိပါတယ်။ မင်းဒီလိုနေရာကို ရောက်လာသင့်တာ ကြာပါပြီ။ ဘာပဲဖြစ်ဖြစ် မင်းရောက်လာခဲ့ပြီး အခုလို အခြေနေကိုရရှိသွားတဲ့အတွက် ဝမ်းသာပါတယ်။ ငါမင်းအတွက် အရမ်းဂုဏ်ယူတယ်၊ MB14။ 🖤🎉
Amazing great great great
Mb14 deserve to be à super star like calum scott
He was finalist at  the voice france and he was with berywam the group of beatbox but after that he left them and start his own show i adore him  im from france too i start to follow him since 2017🙏
Speaking about talent, this guy is an Actor, Singer, Beatboxer, Looper, musician, performer, and go through the grand final of The Voice France, this guy is just perfect
The voice France, un film (tenor)... quel talent
With Alesha's dance😊😍😍😍
I’d love to see him do a duet with Ed Sheeran
This is phenomenal!!!
ESHHH!!! THATS MB14! YOU DESERVED ALL THIS KING👑
How do you do that
Congratulations MB14  I'm gonna cry 😢
Big ups to MB14,  I highly recommend watching MB14 vs Saro, its from a while ago, Saro is a completely different animal, but MB14 showed his excellent skills too. One of the all time great beatbox loopstation battles. What an excellent audition, let's see what he brings to the finals!
Excellent
So damn proud of France right now
This is called magic ✨
I didn't have to listen the whole song to know that it's gonna be so sick. Cuz MB14 is always sick
He’s a humble guy. God/Allah bless him!
nice
ESHH
Wow🎉
Roman Reigns brother❤
We just saw 50% of his talent here. Stay tuned people, you are not ready.
Power of beatbox
Wow he made Simon speechless. I'm so happy for him he deserves it so much. Since the Voice France he grew up so much. His talent is phenomenal, yes Simon was right 🎉🎉👏👏👏
That was crap. Come on.
Amplement mérité MB14 🫱🏿‍🫲🏾✊🏾💯💯 BONNE CONTINUATION
Is annoys me that these people have no clue what talent is out there in the beatbox community. MB14 is a beatbox legend but he barely scratches the surface. Get get over to Swissbeatbox people and watch all their videos!!!
Esh. That's all that needs to be said.
A True Legend! Thank you gor this MB14!
Tellement de joie avec ce golden buzzer!!! C'était une merveilleuse presta, avec un échange avec tout le public. Ouah. Bonne chance pour la suite!!!
Amazing! And what a cool guy
"We don't know how he made all those sounds, but..."  It's called practice and dedication to the art.
His real name is Mohamed and the 14 represents his football shirt number when he was a kid.
Le meilleur !!! Le mec fait tout !!! Beatbox loopstation rap opera cinema !!! Tu es un dieu  !!! 🫡
Congratulations MB14, proud of you🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I’ve been following MB14 for years. Beatbox. Opera. There is no competition.
This man is impressive, you should know that he has made a movie in France called Tenor which is beautiful.
MB14 depuis la découverte de ton énorme talent à The Voice France je t imagine briller tellement ta musique est spéciale , originale et fait du bien ! Golden buzzer mérité contente que partout où tu ailles la reconnaissance de ton talent est unanime et universelle.  Je te souhaite une belle carrière musicale ! encore bravo 👏 🎉
from GBB to BGT👑
Thats a talent👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
this man's face, eyes, and smile -- so beautiful. what comes to mind is that with his beautiful comforting & pure face, he could play Jesus far better than most of the ones who did. apart from his face, his demeanor, his countenance, his attitude, is just as nice as his face - no hint of any malice or pride whatsoever. still apart from these, his genius put into his craft/talent and the way he is just enjoying what he does --- it is a great thing that he revealed himself so that the world could watch him and feel blessed by all of who he is and what he does. his totality is a treat, and again that pure angelic smile just makes someone's day instantly bright. i wish his genius creativity keeps pouring out and makes him win the season.
MB14 ❤❤❤❤
Spiccys and froggies and audience plants. Modern day UK, why be open and honest when you can fudge reality. The little 3rd world island of the worlds garbage and mongrels. Rubbish.
MB 14 ❤️
MB14 had always this wordclass talent in Him..
For those who don't know he was a part of the beatbox group BERYWAM. He left and then was replaced by beasty.   BE - Beatness  RY- Rythmind  WA - Wawad M- Mb14
That’s a full band inside his mouth!!!!
is that zayn brother?
Omg yessss vive la France
If only there was an 808 in a drop 😢
Incroyable bravo MB14 🔥  Tellement mérité 🙏
Yeeaah MB14 never die 🤙🤙🔥🔥  Bring beatbox to the word bro
Vive la France ! Le meilleur beatboxer du monde notre MB14 😁
well ya but he is the best
Heck....this guy is waaaaayyyyy beyond phenomenal.... whole package... 💯% golden buzzer well deserved 🙌
i wish he would have said his relation to berywam
Pyramid best version 👊👊👊
I'm a big fan of MB14 since the battles of swissbeatbox especially vs Saro.
Lezgoooo!!!! 🥳🔥🔥🔥🔥
Mb14 IS an Amazing beatboxer ND an Opéra Singer and i really find it intressting to combinate between thé two...so keep up brother ❤️✨
He is the best 👌
BIG UP this talented young man. Truly phenomenal skill and showman!!!
I wish he hadn't gotten the golden buzzer because I wanted to see the competion
Wooww Amazing talent 😍😍😍😍
He's a great artist, beatboxer, singer, rapper, or should I say he's a great actor too. What a talent!! ❤
Simply amazingly phenomenal 🙌🙌🙌🙌
That "NAMASTHE" at the last moment...🔥🔥
We need the MB14 and Saro tag team back for BGT
THIS, is a TALENT.
does anyone know what looper he is using? edit: it's a rc-505 in case anyone else is wondering
This guy created an amapiano beat, just like that 🤭😂
Marc Rebillet should enter.
I'm so fascinated by the fact that beatboxing is so unknown to the general public haha. MB14 has been one of the most well respected artists in the scene for years now, to see him crushing the stage like this on a talent show makes me so happy to see. Hope to see more and more beatboxers break through!
Legend 🎉
Wow what a talent 👏👏
This dude was on the voice France wasn't he?
MB14!!!!!!!
💖 💖 💖 💖
MB 14 One of my idols in the world of Beatbox, you deserve to be the champion bro
Hope that ticka tape is recycled
Since when did they add stalking yhe audience into the videos
Vive la France 🎉🎉🎉
BGT you're not ready! It's only the begining and MB14 is going to blow your mind 👏👏👏😍🇨🇵
I close my eyes I fell the presence of  peace Spirit
Tellement mérité, MB14 a tellement de talent. J’espère qu’il gagnera.
The Longest Goosebumps I ever had in my life, so freakin Brilliant. Specially at 4:48. . Just Wow..
We can all agree that it simon approves, Its done ✅ Well deserved brother! All love and peace! Shake the World
merci mb14, j' aime tout ce que tu fais, un jour tu auras le golden buzzer, ah non, tu viens de le faire, merci encorre, fais les rever avec ta musique,moi c'est deja le cas
SBX will be so proud bro !!
I love beatbox and I watched all of his videos
Cleaver stuff 😂
C'est incroyable, MB14 tu mérites tous ce qu'il t'arrive. Tu as retourné la salle 👏👏👏
this is not a audition BGT must pay for the SHOW
France is not ready for that guy, he's been on the voice France twice and the impact he did in BGT he has never done it there.
Been known him from the Voice France 2016. He deserved that golden buzzer. In The Voice, seem no one impressed by him.
that's what you call talent... mesmerizing
Finally MB14 😊
john travolta smile 😁
👏👏👏👏👏👏
The beatbox community is very proud of you. Well deserved❤️
Ooooh my! He is handsome🥰🥰🥰
He’s already a legend in world of beatbox for years! So happy for him!
Mohammed is handsome too. He is talented Shukran
he’s ADORABLE
Heeeee make our comunity prount❤❤❤❤❤
Never have I seen Simon  lost for words.
He's the former member of BERYWAM😁😁
He’s a vibe all his own! 🙌🏾 incredible
Don't like the show but there's a guy with some ACTUAL talent.
ONE OF THE BEST BEATBOXER WHO CAN PLAY LOOPSTATION 🔥🔥🥰🥰💰🥰🥰😁😁
BERyWAmb14 he's one of those in the BERYWAM WHO ALREADY SHAKE THE WHOLE WORLD🥰🔥🔥🔥
This guy is very talented and his hot 🔥
100* me repeat
Sounded good but the sounds continued whilst he paused. Looked like it was mimed and the perfomance fell like a lead baloon 😅
Couldn’t stop pressing the rewind button ❤ he is amazing 🫶 he will go far x x x x well done!!
BERYWAM
2:48
I will go to his concert
One thing come to my mind!  "5th Element"  Alien singer!  Only he is doing everything with no orchestra!
Egyptian god of beatbox
This is a much better stage for his talents that the Voice was.  MB14 is a brilliant artist.  Beatbox and looping definitely need to be more centre stage and less hidden by mainstream music.
KING MB14
MB14まじで誇らしいよ、、、
Amazing just amazing talent and audition! His life will never be the same 👍
Contestant is great....those two ladies in the crowd is not😅
All your hard work is paid off, well done ‼️
parang may pagka leron leron sinta ung last beat
2 things that i dissapoint from this performance:  1. He didn't add the rap part 2. It ends  Go watch the full video in his channel I suppose the title is "pyramid"
So happy to see how far you’ve come MB14. You deserve it all brother
Him after the golden buzzer : " Bring it on, I deserve every bit of it"😌
I'm glad i didn't ignore this video🤩!
MB14 a beatboxer in the S Level--amazing!
He is the part of berywam why he left
Lo conozco desde la voz francia y es todo talento 100%
Ça c'est du Crunch 😊
OMG 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Love it love it
Beatboxing usually does nothing for me... but adding the loop station changes everything! Gave me goosebumps! Absolutely brilliant
Such a humble man
They golden buzz Jesus 🤣🤣🤣🤜🤜🤜🤜🤜🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Phenomenal. My insides were shaking and by the end of it my heart was so full it started leaking out of my eyes. Absolute unique huge talent!
Don't forget that his former group is the Berywam who also participated in BGT.
All fixed BGT this show has been ruined 👎🏼
That was extraordinarily superb, absolutely loved it.
My camel started getting sturdy
The string sounds are fantastic. That’s it.
Tellement fier de toi MB14 !
The real GOAT of beatbox scene, MB14 ❤❤❤
❣❣
شيء لا يصدق ما شاء الله 😮
MB14, celui qui aurait dû remporter the voice.
If Aleisha stands up it's definitely fire 🔥
😘😘❤️☪️☪️☪️☪️☪️☪️🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩respect Mohammed 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
john snow killing it 😆💯
no crying, no sad back stories, just pure talent.
MB14 is considered one of the GOATS of loop station. He is the first loop station prodigy. Mark my words, BGT isn't ready for his ROUTINES.. Rooting for him to win this year. Trust me, HE'S HIM!  WE LOVE YOU FOREVER MB14❤❤ ESH❤❤
أحمد محسن 🎶
MB14 really deserve this ❤️❤️❤️
The next viral video after Berywam's Audition
i wouldnt really call it beatboxing if hes using autotune x
Amazing ❤xxx
Shut out the gay talk….all BS
My name is: Mohammad. Fingers crossed.  Satan:😮
BGT....1 RIGGED & VERY FIXED SHOW
he's one of the berrywam right?
il connais que une musique car en France il a déjà fait la même chose 😅 ?
wait what??? he has a machine to loop and change his voice..HMMMMMM    it's nice but the machine is doing all the work
them: How many times have you watched this performance ?  Me: Yes
U know..that the video is so inspirational..i love how they cheer for MB14 and he is also talented.. if you watch closely..the way they smile,the way they cheer up,the way they are so happy..the way of slow motion and that the scenes are so magical ❤
Man, I hate all that applause and cheer during the performance. Let the man do its show and us hear it. Other than that, super performance from MB14
Woaaahhh..❤❤❤
The real artist ❤🎉
Non-beatboxers will probably be shocked if he does the cover of Lovit by Marian Hill 🤣.
He's one of the members of BERYWAM before MB14!✨
Finally a solo beatboxer made it!!! It took a repeator and a synth but totally a win. I had dreams of this when I was younger and I'm so happy to see someone had the same dream lol. Great job!!!
He deserve it. What a talent.
so cute😊
Damn i kinda feel bad for someone who perform after him😂
اكثر من رائع 💕 بس كنت اتمنى يذكره الجنسية الاصلية لان بالتأكيد عربي يحمل جنسية فرنسية
Gosh bump.. Bro..
simon was flabbergasted
Loved him on the voice!! He’s soooooo talented!!❤❤❤❤❤❤
DO IT WITH THE MIC ONLY I DARE YOU DUDE
Apparently judges don't spend much time browsing Youtube😁. MB14 already has a quite huge popularity among beatboxer enthusiasts in Youtube.
man
Mb14 omg🤩🔥❤️
🔥🔥🔥
WOW! Now that's what I call a cool audition! To be able to compose each component of the instrumental with just your voice and loop them over one another like that is just pure talent. Congratulations MB14, I am looking forward to seeing what you have in store for us. 😎
now if only the audience would shut up so we can hear him clearer..
I want to hear his music over and over again ..
Que cara bom pqp
Nothing special! Why do you too over?
He deserved it.. He left Berywam to develop himself in solo mode;  of voice, and Loop Station. Fabulous 👏
I remember when MB14 did this performance in the German beatbox battle showcase 2019 . So Dope to see him and beatbox evolve so much.
Mb14 se destaca com a sua voz desde o tempo do início do Berywam, mas o que esse cara faz, é absurdo, o cara simplesmente faz um concerto sozinho. E nao é qualquer pessoa que deixa o Simon de boca aberta assim.
FKJ feels too well equipped compared to this guy 😂😂😂
Original mb14
Esse cara vai ganhar essa edição se continuar fazendo esse espectáculo realmente me surpreendeu 👏🚀🥇
Already fell in love with him right after i saw his ponytail ❤❤❤ hes super talented, handsaome and sweet
he’s former berrywam. 🎉🎉👌
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Grabe nkakakilabot at sobrang galing
I thought he's atleast 40 😮
Actually this is not full act. It's a part of his beautiful performance. Love him very much, always unbelievable....
Maybe someone know the BGM song .... ? Tell me please
The voice France, he made it with Mika
He is a pro woow thats talent
He's French, any chance of actual British people instead the international lot that keeps auditioning
what would happen if harry mack hit BGT or AGT? With like Veltri and Landers????? BOOM
reminds me the looks of john Travolta during his time
To record his samples and fuse them on the spot is freaking insane!
Mohammed ....you amazing ... cool man
Get Azel and the people would be scared of the sounds.
Ooo, BERYWAM on one show, MB14 on another!!! LET’S GO!! Let’s go…
Frère de the voice au cinéma et te voilà en Angleterre ! Beaucoup de bonheur !!!! Oui tu es exceptionnel et je suis fier de ta réussite !!!! ❤❤❤
Bro looks like Basim from Assassin's Creed.
I was actually wondering if MB14 was going to the Got  talent, 1 day later he is!! wtf?? congrats man
Awesome MB14! But how annoying is the gray-haired judge!
One of the things I've learned so far in life is that the French are formidable musicians. This was great!
Remember that he was the beginning of Biran(from AGT)..the man is a king of beatbox
been following mb14 for a few years now since his video against saro. Excited for the world to see more of him!
Ive been supporting MB14 since 2016. You deserved in man!! Im so proud ❤️🫶

Beatboxing royalty! I wish Saro and Napom also go to BGT and AGT
Actually he is from Berywam, and maybe he decided want to go solo.

Allez MB14 on y croit ! Tu fais la fierté de notre pays depuis un ptit moment, tu es la meilleure image de marque des Beatboxers avec ton talent et ton humilité. Cette audition est magique. Un immense bravo ❤
So sick of tired of you and your crew going to every "got talent" show. It's hilarious at this point.

Pessoas do bem 🌟🍁🙌🌟
This was absolutely insane, loved every moment and can't wait to see more!
Simon says where have you been, but he actually has had some fame. I knew who he was right away and I'm in Illinois. But I am a Youtube addict living amongst the cornfields.
He's an arab for sure
Yooo
MB14 always been an inspiration, good to see his style again!
His smile..i am smiling now from Malaysia🫠
Ooh j'adore ce gars ! Trop bien ce goldenbuzzer ! ❤

So well deserved! A true icon of the beatbox community
This guy will win BGT 🏆 🎉
Il a fait THE VOICE FRANCE 😀 . Il n’a pas gagné mais il est allé assez loin. C’est cool pour lui 👍🏻
Give that man a beer👍✊️
Bruh, I’m wasting my time in the U.S. cause France obviously been hiding this guy. He’s definitely the whole package! No instrumentals needed 🤪
C'est un crack ce mec il est trop fort
Brother congratulations at the end I cried you did something extraordinary and we who follow you for a long time and who follow and support beatbox are very proud

I remember mbs video he posted doing this exact beat
The first sound I heard from him MB14..makes me feeling good..have inner peace on me.. golden buzzer he deserved..I wish you luck until the final..you beat my ❤️ heart bro.
Saw him in 2017. a) his voice improved by a lot over the years b) he's grown into handsome man c) he did put a lot of work into this competition d) legend has it, Simon still keeps his jaw open e) <3 to the beatbox community.
AMAZING
The best.. what a gift u have..u deserve that golden buzzer ..love it ❤️
I can’t believe my self that I really like and I love what I’ve heard beatbox mb14 because normally I hate beatbox, I re-watched the video 20 times
Et oui je savais bien que je le connais se gars et en plus il es 100 pour 100 Français même si il fait the voice France et il a tourné dans un film. je suis très fier de lui et fan de lui. Signé un fan de MB14
This guy was on the french voice like 8 years ago lol "c'est looper"
i mean i hope its real but he got a whole set up.. are you sure its not a SOUND BOARD.. lol
Very talented and gorgeous! 😍😍
his life changed today
!!!
adam bütün müzik enstürmanlarını tek başına boşa çıkardı aq.
3:35 He would 100% win the Xfactor if he auditioned😂😂
The Smile at 3:13 and 3:29😁❤️ Congratulations lad 🎉 👏
I had no idea that MB14 was even on BGT and not only that but he got the golden buzzer as well lmao.
He is also an actor
De que tiene talento tiene talento, pero tiene una película, ha participado en varios got talent... Tiene su propia música.  Ya es famoso!!! para ese caso audiciona cualquier cantante famoso igual le dan botón dorado si es bueno 🤷‍♂️ no tiene mucho sentido
Phenomenal!!  Brilliant !  So Unique!  Standing ovation from me.  👏
Beatbox for life man 💯
Pure Talent
Remember him from the Voice, doing gangstas paradise
Trust me , i’ve been following him for so many years , you ain’t see anything 🤣 . Be prepare to be shocked in the next rounds
GG boss ♥
u deserve it man after this brulliant work
saro will come and win!!!
bruno is so goofy
This is so huge for the beatbox community! I knew one day this would happen
Name of song ?
He’s cute as punch.
So famous people made more famous?
Only judges should be able to have a vote.
the song is called mb14 pyramids
BGT has had loopers before haven't they?
This made me cry. Well deserved. He deserves to be HEARD. Amazing and talented omg
Tout simplement incroyable !
That was amazing
Beautiful😍
Bravo il mérite amplement ❤
Saro!
I make the same noises after burrito Supreme delux
Finally, a reason to enter to YouTube everyday
What a great guy!!!!!!!
He’s visibly humbled! What a talent!
you bossed it.. very impressive
🔥🔥
He is so Humble and Passionate, Very5 talented person. One of a kind, a very well deserved golden buzzer
Frankreich ??? You are araber
As a long time beatbox and MB14 fan, it's amazing to see him get this kind of recognition. 1.3 million views in a day.  Let's Gooooo!
y'all, I think I just fell in love😅🤍
❤❤❤❤
I really dont know how people still dont know about loopstation and its community. Loopstation/Beatbox community is probably the nicest in the world and I really wish MB14 all the best. We already know you as a big showman. I highly recommend people who never heard anything like that just look for Beatbox / loopstation battles. You are welcome :)
i have been watching mb14 for years, he is a legend in the beatbox scene and such a humble guy despite being a genius
it's not even his best performance
Dayuuumn, it was so amazing. Even Simon was speechless
Wooooooow😍😍😍😍😍👍👍👍👍👍👍🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥goooooood👌👌👌👌👌👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
I dont get all of the hair comments.   It looks like he has mousse and squirrel in it.
new star is born!!!!!! END
Reminds me a little bit of Gennady Tkachenko-Papizh from Georgia's Got Talent - totally different vibe, but the same amazing level of vocal performing! Well done to MB14 - I look forward to watching his journey unfold 😊
C'était déjà un de mes favoris à The Voice QUELLLLL TALENT ❤
mb14 has always been the goat.
🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦
Mb14 is just awesome!!! His the best
Now now imagine if MB14 and SARO came on this show together that would be mind blowing
The song at the start what's it called.
What a TALENT! 💪💪💪
When he  can't win beatbox International so he has to try talent shows 😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
What an audition. Amazing. Apart from that what a beautiful smile 🎉
This is the best side whit multicultur. This is multicultur I embrace. I'm crying, I'm happy, I'm smiling, I'm happy to be alive. I love him.
esperei mt por isso o cara e fera dms
He performed this in Germany and it's on the beatbox Germany channel. Better performance than this.
That's so original ❤ love it
Ele é muito bom, quando se apresentou no the voice na França, acompanhei e assisti do Brasil, ele é muito bom.
Wow this was the best beatbox I've ever seen❤😢🎉
Love to see mb14 still getting the love he deserves
ابدعت يا محمد ابدعت ماشاء الله تبارك الله عليك ❤ اضافه الموسيقي العربيه خليتها في حته تانيه خالص  ابدعت
Trop de talent !!! Fière du parcours de Mohammed !
Its 2023 not 1980
2:52
incredible, such talent, if this had a little more added it surely would become a dance hit
MB14 is a world class beatboxer and looper.  Amazing to see him killing it on these reality shows.  ESH!
His real name is Mohamed Belkhir and he is of Algerian origin
Chongazo😈😈
Bravo pour le courage qu'il a eut d'aller se frotter à ce monstre qu'est BGT
I think he is of Algerian origin 😍 This is the real art  He's just amazing ❤❤
Omg that was Aaaaaaaaammmmmmazzzzzing👌👌😂
One incredible talent.. layer upon layer of of incredible innovation
I knew this day will come ❤❤❤ mb14 is a real artist and he earned that golden buzzer
The greatest thing i have ever seen on BGT. Insane
Quel chemin parcourus ! Ta voix est exceptionnelle dans tous les sens du terme !!! Simon était époustouflé de ta prestation!... et pourtant il est dur à convaincre !!!  Tu es un VRAI talent, tu iras loin, très loin !  Les portes s'ouvrent en GRAND pour toi et tu le mérites !  C'est ça "croire en soi" 😇🙏🏻 Bravo pour nous donner ce plaisir de t'écouter et de voir ton jeu d'acteur également.
Another Level the bar is set high!
He's name is Mohamed so he's a Muslim from Algeria or Morocco living in France
Bravo momo 👏
im a huge fan of mb14 this guy is the best❤
Its not an audition. This is a show..!!!
Se esse cara não ganhar essa temporada eu tô maluca pô
Without knowing anything, seeing a French person with Arabic heritage just makes me smile - the force for happiness and good will always prevail in a land of diverse backgrounds.
I’ve been following the beatbox community since SoCloseToToast and Codfish were beatboxing in video games back in the early 2010’s. This is so well deserved for MB14!🥹
He was originally the M in Berywam, for those who follow AGT. Plus he's been a great competitor in The Voice France... And there are too many things to say about him.
Wa the girls at 5:07 are stunning !
WOW that was awesome.......
C'est un monstre de talent il avait déjà marqué sa place sur les battle de beatbox et épaté dans the voice en France avec sa reprise de coolio! Bravo tu mérites
I've been following MB14 for 7 years and now I'm just crying.  I am extremely proud and happy for this man of art ♥️
Do you like it? It's French 😄👌🏻
He seems lovely, gave me goosebumps and watched it like 50 times+. Amazing, audience shouting more ❤
Wow, the standards have dropped dramatically since Boyle and Potts.
AMAZINGLY BRILLIANCE AND SEXY MAN TOO ❤
BERYWAM. BEatness RYthmind WAwad MB14... now repleaced by Beasty after he decided to go solo. Beatbox family loves you MB14 gl in the show. Eeesh!
next time play ROAD TO ZION!
Je suis malentendant mais vous je vous entend bien MB14, depuis ce matin je vous écoute inlassablement en boucle avec ma femme...comme à l'époque de the voice fr et on a pas compris pourquoi vous avez pas gagné...bref...on vous souhaite tout le bonheur de réussir à l'international maintenant que vous êtes au BGT et nous vous souiveront ❤❤❤
هذا مانريدة ما نريدة من ذات الأصول العربية أن يقدموة 😊😊
Quality act but my god relax on the montages. Just show his reaction. Forget about trying to create a moment with ur editing. The actual moment is the moment.
He's so talented. His loop battles were 🔥.  Especially second track when he was vs. Thorsen.
Does the program still exist? Wtf
Simon is looking at him like he’s money for his record label lool
Adrenochrome junkies...
David back pls!!
He has participated in TheVoice France before
I love how MB14 is bringing beatboxing into the mainstream, to really show what the community has to offer, excluding sketchy beatboxing companies ofc... Make beatboxing cool again!
Thats a real G !!!
HE'S BACK! <3 MB14 the best
ESH!!
Fantastic
Been following this man from SwissBeatbox's GBB. He's a phenomenal talent. He really deserves it and more.
That was… errrrr            Wow
Beatboxing ? Not my World, but THIS is epic !
Britain's got Talent. Should be renamed to Got Talent, why are we letting people audition who aren't from Britain? France have their own version of the show
I am so happy to see this, I can't even describe it! I've followed him since I went into the beatboxing scene a few years ago and he always was my number 1 looper to listen to, I especially like that he has actually perfect pitch and doesn't use many effects on the loopstation like others and he doesn't need a 2nd device either.
Wooow,!
This gives me Tokio Myers vibes. This guy needs to win. Unbelievable. Like one wrong step and the whole performance is done. Insane.
If you liked this you better watch Sam Perry in The Voice Australia
VRAIMENT EPIC
spoiler: this is his 1% of skills
110% gold deserving
If there was any justice in this world he will be in the final and I'd be surprised if he didn't win!! Well Done that man !!👏👏👏👏👏👏
Go see the movie where he plays in it, he sings absolutely well, his name is: tenor (French movie)
Just WOW... love this guy... he is so talented.. I've watched this dozens of times since BGT... Eat, Sleep and Repeat...
dlow shouldve done it first
These got talent shows are so hard to watch because of the "audience" taking, which are obviously scripted. Sometimes even the judges actions are scripted.  Does anyone like the audience's clearly fake reactions?  It feels like someone is pulling my nails apart or my teeth is being pushed outside by my gums.
Is he ashamed of he's name? the best creation walked on the face of this world 🌍❤️  Muhammad saws❤ the name of the prophet
The judges facial expressions are way too much 😅 overreacting
Je suis tellement trop fière de lui ! 😄 On la connu en France il y a des années, il a eu une sacrée évolution depuis. Il est tellement fort c’est amplement mérité ! Bravo ! Fiers que tu sois des nôtres 🇫🇷🫶🏻
Gorgeous
This was amazing
MB!!!! So so happy for you brotha!
Im french and i feel bad for, all the britain's talents.. this person is actually famous he doesnt nee to get promoted... many people are so much talented and really deserve his place....
MB14 best of the best you killed it bro wow wow wow perfect for all the shows
Donc on a de quelqu’un incroyable de chez nous aussi 🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷😂 Vive de la France vive la républicaine
Bruno is so funny much better than David Williams MB14 is hot ❤
Pushing beatboxing to another level. Thank you MB14 for showing the world the true power of the human voice as well as showing everyone that beatbox is music ❤
That was a phenomenal performance
Allegedly, Amber Heard quit Hollywood and Even changed her name
Ong this guy are amazing
This was just incredible!!!❤❤❤❤🎉
MB14 legend in the loopstation
The boy is already famous through other shows bit of a fix he is good but feel a bit disappointed now
So So need to get on there now.
Wonderful  beatboxing 5🌟
Simon's face scares me these days reminds me of that lady that Adam Sandler points out in Just go with it
Beardyman been doing this for Years
This was just incredible!!!🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤
MB14 I'm your beatbox fan from Iran 🎉✌️✌️ congrats bro
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Are we really questioning if MB is a talent?... he's inspirational, incredible....the whole world should start considering him as a legend...
The time when Simons faces reactions are the same cause of extreme botox.
Truly is phenomenal with a fantastic smile and yes that hair 🥰
Imagine MB14 and D-low against eachother in the finals 🙈🙈🙉🙉
Complete fake
That's hilarious it's called Britain's got talent hi I live in France silly frog
Waste of a golden buzzer. Without his fancy little machine his act is nothing and I’m sure they’ve had an act on like this in previous series.
This is Ross from F.R.i.E.N.D.S with actual talent!😅Amazing!!
MB14 pyramid loopstation.
How tf no one already know about him ?? Isn't MB14 famous??
Extraordinaire bravo frenchy c'est mérité. Tu es sur le bon chemin....😉🥰🇨🇵
MB14 is my fav beatboxer and looper in the world im glad that i look like him irl hhhh <3
C'est vraiment mérité, il a un talent fou, il est exceptionnel. ❤
I was at that audition where are the other acts from it only that golden buzzer was shown
Fabulous! Amazing!! Great!!! 💖💫💞
I'm glad he's known all over the world now.. I have always been a big fan of him since his first blind audition on the voice France
On est fier de toi !!!! Big UP 🔥🔥🔥
He’s a raw talent ❤
Esh!
Whoever put the ads (especially the unskippable IN THE MIDDLE of the performance right at the beatbox transition needs to be drawn and quartered.
True Legend of beatboxing
Супер  талантливый парень🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉👍👍👍👍👍👍🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹
No sad story..just pure great talent ❤
The golden buzzer makes tears in my eyes
Omg 🥳So happy to see the goat absolutely smashing it , I feel like everyone was ready to hit the golden buzzer 😁MB14🙌
The golden buzzer seems nothing special for him. He was beyond that
Wow this guy is certainly a winner.. brilliant🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
MB 14 It's crazy how far you've come. One of my favorites & one of the best loop station artist in beatboxing for me.
Oh my gosh,  fantastic
MB14 is my fav beatbox
It was ok I guess
You can clearly see that these people never saw loopstation competitions...
You are Muhammad
He good but sam perry was the first to do it on America's got talent and way better go check him out people
My guy has 3 voices at once
Very Nice  I've
I love how in sync Ant and Dec are in their minds, every time they give a joint golden buzzer
They just put in Celestial by Ed Sheeran as background music baby! 5:33
Opera beatbox and instument all at once amazing
Brutal MB14 portugal Suíça 👌💪
Congrats man. Loopstation and beatbox is life
He does it with so much love and was very engrossed in it❤❤❤
On more important (and breaking) news, Simon can again blink using his left eye. What a relief.
He was part of berywam, great to see him doing well solo
❤❤🔥🔥🔥🔥
Insane!! Love to see beatboxers and loopers doing this!!
Cowell jaw dropped 😂
When you're in a group project but have to do it all by yourself
No religion No nationality No racism No boundaries No language ………. Only TALENT ❤❤
That’s my boy mb14
Can we give ant & dec & sneak staircase to make it less obvious 😂....  Oh wait...its all a fix, someone I know audutioned for bgt, brilliant singer, no sob story, no yes 🙄
I followed him on the Voice in France and thought he was amazing then so no surprise to see him at this level!! Arguably one of the best first auditions of the show, that was just MAGIC👏👏👏
il reste tellement humble
Ive seen mb14 somewhere in Dubai.. ill get back to my comment i remember the place❤
وين هاوي ماندال كان يعطي البرنامج قوه
He is really cute and really talented.😍 Ant and Dec's golden buzzers are my favorite.🤍
This low vibrational trash is what passes for entertainment in today's occasionally united kingdom.  5 watt lightbulbs like these two are made multi millionaires by the totally dumbed down occupants of this sad kingdom...for doing absolutely ...nothing.
humble man, well- he deserve this.👍
blown away.
This is the french talent 😋
First person I heard doing this kind of thing was morf music here on YouTube..
He is the men of the movie Tenor
Mb14 has been an inspiration to many loopers in the beatbox.❤
Beatboxing, another useless talent that makes talentless, shallow people feel special. No thanks. I'm sure I'm going to get hate for this but I could care less bc I will always be smarter than a beatboxer groupie. Lol.
You tryna tell me that’s not Bad Bunny 😂
Never thought I would love beatboxing, but his golden performance changed my mind entirely. This multi-talented man has a big fan (Me) and a big future.
غي البداية قلت انه ليس جيد لكن تفاعل الجمهور معه  جعلي غير رأيي كان هاذا مذهلا
Gość jest niesamowity
The GOAT beatboxer 'MB14' 🔥
Love you 💝💖💖💗
This guys is so gooooood
Un tueur le français amazing
I follow you Mb14;)And you are amazing!You are so talented that everyone should hear about you!
MB14 continuing to be one of the GOATs. Nothing new! 🎉🎉🎉
I didn't want it to end ...it's really good 😢😢🇰🇪
If that was just his audition, I'm sure he's holding back. Can't wait to see what he does next!
Lets go champ
I only see this for these things
JAAAA
What a coincidence! BGT winner and runner up, 2023, have the same initials: M B.: Malakai and   and Mohammed Love it!
Finally MB14 is on BGT 🥹🤌
Congratulations Muhammad
Kein Wunder er war schon der beste in dem Film Tenor voll geil das er es auch in dieser show geklapt hat und hoffe er wird gewinnen der Mann ist einfach nur Oberkassel in beatboxen und ein echt sexy Kerl. 😊
🎉🎉🎉
AND THIS WASNT EVEN HIS BEST PERFORMANCE, if only people knew he was competed in the voice france 2016 and got second place, on beatbox competitions -the GBB- and many other events. I dont know how they havent heard of him, and why he isnt very famous yet
Participated in The Voice France, he played in a movie and now in BGT!?? He's just amazing! Félicitations !!
woww MB14🔥🔥🔥🔥
Woah

Jeez, I’m actually crying.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
WOW... Il mérite et les confetti avec... Magique
Imagine their reaction when they will learn than mb14 was part of berywam
If I am not mistaken he is originally from Algeria and name is Mohammed very proud of this brother.
So no one knew about him before this am shocked like simon said u should have heard of him
Check up this comment one year later. It's gonna be an absolute sensation like Calum Scott 8 years ago
I don't know how many times I've watched it, I still like it❤. It's amazing 👏.
Imagine if they knew there is a whole competition on it hehe
simon shochk!!!
Wow! I'm late to the concert! He's phenomenal.  I felt that in my soul.
MB14, Well done buddy... Hypnotic, your soul just drives the audience to get up and dance...  Seen many loopers, but this was amazing... So deserved the golden buzzer.  Reckon this could be the winning act.
I believe there was an act in The Voice America but, this one is better.
He was so SUPER!!!!!!!
He was liked in the moment he walked that stage
God!
OMG he is so amazing.. truly deserving of the golden buzzer..😀
MB14 is one talented guy, I am following hiw work for years now and every time I get goosebumps when I hear his voice.
Hope he will surprise them all with his singing next time
UN VRAI TALENT UE L' on a pus suivre aussi en france lors des auditions en france . UN vrai plaisir de le réentendre
Wow amazing
Mohamed, quel talent!
Good job mohammad great talent
Hope he wins it.
Mohamed, I don't know you but something is clear you deserve the best.
Jest fantastyczny !😊
Britain’s got talent?
Outstanding performance..he is a  feast for the eyes !❤what beautiful smile!
Been going for years.Voice france 2016
YES THE BEATBOXING GOAT LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
WOW!!!🎉❤
The world didn't see the pawer of mb14 yet this is just the beggining he is one of the best loppstaion and beatboxer ❤
Definitely watching more than once
Saw him do this in France like 8 years ago….
Bruno Tonioli❤❤❤
Glad for Mb14! He really deserves it
Wow ❤️❤️❤️
I like his name
He's backkkkk
What beatboxer that is talent so that's why dererve a golden buzzer
INCREDIBLE. AMAZING. the touch of Lord!! ❤❤❤
Big ups for the video editing guy. He did an amassing job too.
He should win BGT his guys is so incredible
He deserves more I used listen to his stuff long time ago mb14 you are the best
Dont deny ..this is one of the best performance ever seen so far
Still not better than Saro 😂 just kidding great job brother I hope to see you at GBB this year
Finalist in The Voice France (the year Slimane won)! I'm  french and this guy is soooo talented, surprising and really cool! He was with Berywam beatboxers, he will surprise you! ^o^
Beardyman has been doing this since forever, not taking away from MB14, talented guy!
I Just wanna marry him! Oh my god 😍
He’s reminded me of dj arch jr special he deserves to win I think or Olivia lynes
excellent , and from France, my country... hope to see more of him.
Loopers are imo a whole other ball game when it comes to beat boxing. MP14 killed it. But to be fair to judges and an audience who has never heard looping before their are many professional loopers that could’ve gotten a golden buzzer. MP14 being one of them. But he choose his audience correctly and Agt is a rigorous application process so hats off to him for actually going through with all of it.
I would proudly say “My name is Mohammed”
MB14 wkkwkw blom lagi saro yg ikut 😂psti bakalan double golden buzer
FIX
fun fact he used to be apart of berywam
Omg😭MB14 congratulation you are absolutly incredible🔥big love from Morroco🇲🇦❤❤❤❤
SHOW THEM❤
MB14 you were wonderful last night.  I wish you great success very soon. God blessings ❤
oalalalalalalalalalaaaa
The man himself changed my life...love him a 3000
Mb14 promoted by djdiamondkutzz 4111 promotion is key
The guy extremely Good 👍😊
Deserved 🫡
Beatbox loopstation favorit saya dari dulu dari smp bahkan.. Sampe mantau dan ikut bentuk team berywam, dan dititik ini anda muncul kembali.. turut banggaa🥳🥳 we love you Mb14  i don't know if you are my brother Muhammad 14.. assalamu'alaikum
❤️🔥
What an incredible talent!!! You can see the £ signs in Simons eyes!!!
Talented AF, he's also hot AF
1:05 “If I can have 4 yeses it would be the perfect scenario’  Well, he actually got 6 yeses plus a golden buzzer. What a stud
WOAAHH MB14 ✨
Genial!
Hes a looper great skills and wonderful to listen to a bit like Sam who was down under in Australia
Unbelievable, golden buzzer was well deserved ❤
Mohamed is just an incredible talent.
Super handsome as well as a gifted musician! 😘
Been following this guy for six years now, and he still has the skills to impress everyone. What an inspiration!
I heard him in Berlin in 2018 and it was incredible! Amazing! everything! In knew he is a big talent
MB14 is absolutely AMAZING!!! A great beatboxer!!!
This should be the new theme song of BGT ngl, real sickk!!!
Amazing Beatboxer Talented Vocalist Pleasant Looper Opera Singer Fantabulous Actor Former BeRyWaM member (Legendary Beatbox Crew) (M stands for MB14) Former GBB Judge Former The Voice France Finalist Former The Voice All Stars France Semi-Finalist BGT'23 Golden Buzzer  GOAT for a reason!!!

Quelle évolution depuis la première fois que je t'ai vu sur the voice France!!! Bravo
That golden buzzer was 100% deserved  Talent like that is really difficult to master and he looked like he did it with ease.  Shows how much effort he put in. everyone for a moment give this man a standing ovation

Was on the voice france a few years ago . Whys it not worked out . Bgt fix
hope mb15 win bgt 2023🎉🎉🎉
Berywam and him performing together on that stage is my new dream now ❤❤
I love it so much
That's so amazing talented I didn't want him to stop 😮
I'm speechless! This video is a keeper. The sounds that he created using only his voice was 'Pure-Genious!' I loved every second, and I love Ant and Dec for giving him the Golden Buzzer, Congrats. XO
Watched him on The Voice France a few years ago! What a showman
Muhammad stole the show, congratulations brother
Love BGT!!
Seeing him here doesn't make me happy it makes me emotional going through his journey just shows that talent always wins ❤❤
He was great.  Poor Simon has to work those frozen face muscles hard to act surprised.
EY YOOO MB14 ❤❤❤❤
I hope BERYWAM  will be proud  Fyi its original member in berywam
Hootsssss❤❤
❤❤❤
First Berywam, Now MB14. Well done my boy, make beatbox mainstream 👏
:)  This guy - is he using a falsetto or is he a true contra tenor?   Great act.
Muhammads don’t take a bow ANT and DECK🤷🤷‍♂️🤷
That's so cool you're such a good 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
My favorite❤
no way you did it MB14
✨🔥🎙MB14 fam 🎙🔥✨
That's a talent
Oui MB14 à un talent fou . Notre chouchou français 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Simon looks like he got stung by the whole hive
Founding member of Berywam, too.
Mind blowing!!! Competition just ended!
If I'm not wrong Simon wanted to press the golden buzzer
Mb14 that I know from the age of 16 until now at the age of 20 that I know he has never failed congrats MB14 I always support you🔥🔥🎉🎉
ooow my god MB14 is back, GG bro !!
Let's go MB14!!!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Our MB14,im soooo happy ,finally  your talent will be recognized at its fair value🎉🎉❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉,Good job Ant & Dec
He is Superhuman
Whoever is not here from beatbox community, you guys are in for a treat
Mb14 THE G.O.A.T
This guy will be working with Hans Zimmer before long, mark my words.
Huh? What made Simon change his opinion so quickly?
Why is he standing so far away from the stage if this show isnt setup? 6:15 🤔
Broo you guys Don’t know How Long I’ve been Waiting For This Momento
mb14 man..
Mb14 is the best. I have been following him for years
I remember this guy from "The Voice French" seven years ago 💙 He was amazing then and now 👏
Anyone Else Getting GBB2019 Flashbacks?....with the LoopStation and All That
You really killed it
MERECIDO O CARA É MARAVILHOSO.
The first Gbb person/judges to get golden buzzer🔥🔥 MB14.
I love his smile too❤
im happy for you bro love you mb14
OMG🔥🔥🔥
The guy is so dramatic and sexy!
He has a contagious smile, but MB14 sounds like some type of vitamins!
I Love how 'I Lived' by One Republic is playing in the Background at the Start... Such an Underrated Song😆
That is talent!!!
Amazing ❤
Belly dance music!
Good stuff. But honestly I could do that, and I know many other as well. Doing it without the looper is the true skill. REEPS ONE is a guy with said true skill, just look him up, you won't be disappointed.
PYRAMIDS at his best performence
MB14 is absolutely incredible, but unfortunately he is not dedicating to Beatboxing 100%. Or at least that's what I assume when he interprets a song that he released more than 4 years ago. You can search for it "Pyramids". He is a very talented musician but it seems to have some kind of limits.
leeeeeeeeeeesgoooo mb14
i remember him in the voice france !! he was amazing and he's still
He is good but not as good as Sam Perry , he is incredible and the winner of the voice. Sam Perry is pure talent, just love him.
Ya decía yo que me resultaba familiar..! Es el actor de la película TENOR!!! :) Increíble talento
He is famous in France, he was semi-finalist in The Voice France , he is a champion of beat boxing, and he was the 1rst role in very good movie "Ténor". I love him!
MB14 always fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥💯
ループでGBはアツすぎる
When Simon said where have you been the whole time and when mb14 answered in French, Simon looked offended.
i miss your performances mb14!! i waited for this😭🔥
Mb14 🔥🔥🔥
Hes already living his Dream touring the world. He was with Berywam aswell. He's a professional
It was amazing, I got goosebumps from your performance MB14 🥺✨, so proud of you, I first got to know you in 2017 at GBB Loopstation Battle & Berywam, I've heard your music and performance many times on several social media platforms, and it was amazing, you are the coolest beatboxer & the best Looper ever, you are a Legend 🔥🥰
ibrahimovic
I wanna give golden buzzer to that lady wearing a white shirt. Really love her. I can feel the intensity 🥺
je suis super heureuse de  voir Mb14, française je l ai découvert  sur the Voice France et son film ténor, j adooore , je lui souhaite de gagner !! biz à lui, il est  extraordinaire
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
@SixnBeatbox @Chezame
,,Very beutiful end" 😢😅
I still can't believe he did that, I think it was a recorded beat 😅
AWSOME
Simon don't look suprise. 😢
YOOOO I WASNT EXPECTING MB14 TO BE HERE
Such an inspiration mind blowing 💚
🧔🏻🧡 SIMPLESMENTE SUBLIME ....
This Is not real , this is not real.. 😄
If you haven't seen him in beatboxing competitions, look them up. He is really good.
Sounds he produced were legit
The man deserves this recognition.
This is probably my favourite BGT performance ever - considering who we’ve seen over the years as well…
He was always in the wrong TV show, i hope he could win this!!!! SO proud of him, no cap!
❤
💖💖💖
That's brilliant 👏 wow 💗💗💗Amazing
mb14🔥  bbx❤‍🔥
muhammad is very humble and great and humble
Roman Reigns???
I saw him on tik tok, he really is brilliant
MB14 🎉🎉🎉 Succes
So much well deserve ! That was Amazing MB14 ! You're such a talented artist !
Bart vs mb14 🔥🔥🔥
They gave the kid golden buzzer for singing opera and this guy did opera and like 10 other talents.
Really he deserve that😢😢😢😢
Wow wow wow wow❤❤❤❤
Thats not sarro?
Such a talented person.. No words to say. Highly appreciable. I love this performance ❤❤❤
YOYOYO KINGG IS BACK 🤴🤴🤴
This is sooooo good!
This is talent plus incredible practice ❤
I've been following MB14's work for many years. This dude deserves it! And even more!
Cool... too cool!
Want to see NME on the stage. He and MB14 the most beautiful beatboxers.
A very deserving golden buzzer audition, period.
You can see he's enjoying what he's doing 🎉
MB14 AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
ហាយ😊
Beardyman created this style however this was a masterclass!
one of the best of 2023👏
Incrível!.....
been watching his videos in beat box competitions he’s amazing talent
dude! this just broadens my horizon on beat boxing! this lit 🔥🔥🔥for reals!
Finally!!  I was waiting for this from a very long time 😭❤️
WOW 🤩❤️🤩  Brilliant 👏👏👏   Vive la France 🇫🇷
It was amazing. Moment like Sam Perry from the voice Australia. Jaw dropping moments. 🎉
Phenomenal! What a talent!
Mb14 is my idol since I was start beatboxing🔥🥰
BGT is so cringy theses days what are them slow mos 😂😂
He is amazing!
Winner❤
He's been huge in the Looper, beatbox world, guys a legend
..
Is that john travolta??
For once im lost for words 🙏🙏 And he's so humble
YOW IT'S BEEN SO LONG MAN🔥😍😁😭  I've been watching MB14 for so many years. I was so surprised and excited when I saw this and sure enough it's him when the video played😁  Y'all get ready for his performance when he gets back on the stage 🔥🔥🔥
ድንቅ ተስጥኦ ላንተ እኔ ደስታ ነኝ
Auto tune
Mb14!!
He's Mb14
I am stand man😊
So they've been running out of talents for a long time now and bringing talents and well known people, youtubers from all over the world, that's smart on Simon's perspective, but they play the audience for a fool. MB14 just did this for money, because he's already one of the best beatboxers in the community.
he looks so sweet bless him
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰😍😍😍😍🤩🤩🤩🤩😄
❤❤❤❤❤
What is so special? that machine got all the special voice effects that's mean people don't know much in general. Probably if they see a bird flying is a miracle
Is he muslim?
Dude took the art of beatbox to a whole other level. Wow!
Yes mb14 he should win easily
damn it came out extravagantly
you deserve it <3
I Love it
Bring Saro with him
Seeing the joy of the respective candidates over the Golden Buzzer always moves me anew.
Awesome 👏👏👏👏
Amazing..he should win!
It's not beat boxing if you use a loop box haha
I am now living in the United kingdom and would to be at this place some day to watch the live. This guy is amazing
He captured the essence of middle east with that beatbox
Very good performance as usual😍
Well deserved
Mb14❤❤❤❤❤❤
Not only does this man have an unspeakable talent, he is a lovely humble man! I hope his life goes nowhere but up from here ❤
Was a pretty good audition... I've seen this done before wasn't spectacular didn't deserve golden.uzzer either
I have seen him  in the French voice and his was phenomenal then and his voice his superbe, love this young man ❤
Simon REALLY changed his life around. Good for him❤❤
WOW!!!!
Enfin je n'attendait que ça MB14 qui représente bien la France en exposant l'audition 💪🏼💪🏼🇫🇷
Omg i love you mb14 im a huge fan since 2017 i love your beatboxing ❤
2:50-4:23-4:28
Smart that he left out the rapping on this track. Definitely playing his cards right so he still has something to wow and surprise the judges in later rounds
One of former member of berywam M  for MB14
Ant n Dec should not be allowed to push the golden buzer..they are not judges.😡😡
I litteraly cried
This is pure talent...👌
😭❤❤
I've been a fan of MB14 for ages now and I was praying he'd one day come here! He'll be the first person I'll actually vote for on this show. MB14 TO WIN!!!!!
That Arabic beat sound....was so on point ❤❤❤👌👌👌 MB14 is a king of beatboxing ...amazing
Dam goosebumps when he got the golden buzzer
He is so handsome and talented. A well equipped package.
MB14❤❤❤❤❤,im soooooo happy
He is fabulous, incredible!! I am still being hypnotized. Such an amazing, talented artist he is. 🤗❤️❤️❤️
he is really talented. Wish he goes all the way to the final 2
Howie like this
Way back 2016, pinapanood na kita lodi, nasa BERYWAM ka pa nun🥺 layo na narating mo lods 👏👏
Hyped to see this, can imagine after his run in this contest there will be a lot more beatbox fans ❤ congrats MB14!
I am a teacher and my role model is in beatboxing MB14 ❤️‍🔥💯
Yes MB14
4:46 it literally gives me a goosebumps all over my body! Always!
Those intro are instant CALL OF DUTY theme Afghanistan
Been following him since GBB. Great to know his talent has been recognized by BGT and The voice.
BGT doesn't know the we used to hear that all the time in gbb rounds😎😎😎🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
MB14 never fails to give me goosebumps 😮 OMG, And because of this audition, there are more people will appreciate how really Amazing mb14's Talent 💙 Congratulations MB14.
4:46 was so Dope , Bruno was right, when the song started its like im hypnotized walking down the pyramids of Giza somewhere holding a Camel dancing with Johnwick 😂 ,Good for him Congratssss 🎉
As a swissbeatbox fan, am so proud of ore Mb14  😭😭
Woww...congrats MB14..
Golden Buzzers without a sob story is rare
Man, there are so so so many talented gifted people on this earth. It is amazing.
Leeetss gooo
If Simon likes it it's really good
Just watching him perform makes me happy. This golden buzzer moment made me even more happy for him . MB14 really deserved all this
THAT WAS AMAZING, made my brain tingle and I even got goosebumps 😮👏👏👏👏👏
ESH!!!
He just delivered a quarter of his talent
He is a one in a million. Unique. I wish him all the  good things that such talent deserves.
Congrats to MB14 A well deserved that Golden Buzzer.  Deck & Ant is so fast, ran to press the Buzzer!😄 Simon was impressed.😀  Love this.❤
Let’s go!!!
Wow!!!!!🎉
❤❤❤ love it! Such an amazing one man band!
He is so amazing.. And he's so handsome, the smile + confetti was magical .   👏
🥺🥺❤️❤️ A legend
very talented and very handsome 💋💞😍 I am your #1 fan here in Philippines 😍😍😍😍
Simon didn’t realize Mohammed was an original member of Berywam.  I think he already judged Berywam a few years back here in USA. Also, I’m suprised he didn’t follow The Voice France
FROM SWISS TO BGT LET’s GOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
He got the audience like a snake charmer!
Simons and Bruno’s face was like 😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
He was on the voice France couple of years ago
100% agree with all their reactions, but how is Simon not dancing to the music lol. That is real talent there.
😢😢😢🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This man has auditioned everywhere my guy needs a nerf omg it's so good!
See you on the semi finals ... ❤❤❤❤
HISTORY ❤️ FIRST BEATBOXER TO GET A GOLDEN BUZZER MB14 ❤️❤️
If you don’t smile throughout watching this, then am sorry
Reminds me of the film gladiator theme
I laughed all the way at how everybody in the audience,the judges mouths were just 😲😧😲😧awe struck...in disbelief that that sound is really coming from his mouth.....wow!!! He is purely talented..
I watched it w times AND THT IS HOW GOOD ITIS I AM SHOCKED
Holden looking more like a witch as she ages, no makeup sense!
More cowell stage managed crap! Staged for ant and dec to 'rush' out to press the button, knowing none of the others would press. I mean how embarrassing if while they rush out someone else was going to press! All pre-arranged!
My kid can beatbox
Hope he wins BGT!🙏
Como é bom ver pessoas q sabem expor o melhor delas
thats what i call TALENT 🙌🙌🙌 he's phenomenal 👏 ✨️
Fortunately, French people like you are there to represent a good image of France! It was time for your talent to be recognized in the world ❤
Magnifique
wow amazing
Just let hear him sing mofos...
I think Simon wanted to press that golden buzzer based on how he reacted to the performance.
Ça ne m’étonne même pas pour toi MB14 il est temps d’être connu à l’international 💪❤️
Simon: I don't know where you've been MB14: I have been in France Well there you have it
That's the same guy from the voice right?
This reminds me of the looper than was on The Voice USA, crazy range!
MB 14 ,Bon sang GARS,tu as tellement bien représenté la FRANCE. Tu n'as pas pu gagner the voice France mais ce serait encore plus BEAU  si cela arrivait de l'autre côté de la Manche.waouh frérot que c'était beau ,bravo oooooh.
What i can do is barking and meowing 😅
Un jeune homme humble et brilliant , gentil souriant et talentueux bravo
4:25 THIS DROP HAD ME JUMPING LETS GO MB14  ESH
Incredible talent
MB14 is a little too much for shows like this, and I personally feel these platforms are a bit below that of his talent and stardom.  P.S. I wish him all the best.
Tears in my eyes, you finally get what you deserve, I'm so happy for you MB14
Cant believe MB14 is on bgt
How did Simon go from hating this to really liking this?
So talent gifted from God
The best golden buzzer
you wanna tell me that no one there knew him from The Voice France?
Where’s David?
His voice tones: he’s probably an exceptional singer
Wow, that’s talent…..and he’s cute❤
OMG, he is amazing!!! I hope The Ghetto Kids or MB14 win this competition, my two favorite acts ever!!!! By the way, i love his smile!!! 😍♥️

THE BESTEST THING I HAVE EVER SEEN
MB14 !!
Amazing MB14 THE BEST ❤🇵🇱
Well done
MB14 FOR LIFE ! Vive la France ! Vive MB14
Le mec il va passer toute sa vie dans ses shows surjoués, avec un irrespect totale de l'artiste ( on parle pendant qu'il acte). C'est un pro ( un film mauvais"Tenor"). Qu'est ce qu'il vient foutre dans ce show ? La question qu'il faut se poser est : " Que faire avec tout ça ?". Avant ce genre de mec courait toute la nuit dans des cabarets pour gagner sa vie. Maintenant, il passe son temps a montrer qu'il peut être un artiste pro. C'est ridicule, juste de la chair à télé.
Trop fière pour lui il le mérite tellement, trop gentil un homme avec de belle valeurs   Merci
Esh!
He is quite famous in France he was in the final in the Voice France and he even played in a movie  So well desserved may be this is an open door to a worldwide recognition
Aller Mb14 tu représentes la France avec ton immense talent, fait nous rêver, fait nous vibrer avec ton énergie et ta créativité infini ! Ramène nous la victoire chez les britanniques ! 😉
Wow im speachless .. one of a kind unforgetable❤❤❤❤
Aprecio ir demais o programa, calouros excelentes, mas nas últimas edições os jurados tem se deixado levar apenas pelas emoções e n pelo conjunto geral
He's so attractive too😂
The best MB14!
Sound quality is really bad but I am glad I am finally seeing him here
Berywarm:()
That was lite work MB14
I could see him with pentatonics
One of the biggest representatives of the beatbox community! We cheer for you MB14! You deserve everything what you worked for!
I've been beatboxing for about 5 years and MB14 was the reason I started ,the first video I ever watched was MB14 Vs SARO and now seeing him becoming soo big makes me soo happy
Genius! Definitely rooting for you this season! 😍

Roman Reigns officially quit WWE
Mr Blobby should have got the golden buzzer , im sure the instrument he had could have made those noises .
Mb14 ex berrywam  beatboxer singer and actor  participé à the voice France  and movie " ténor"
you know what judge you need :P Marco Pierre White I know his a chef but.. get trough with him is gonna be a bless if not you get a death stare for eternity
OMG MB14 lessgoooooo!!! I remember starting beatbox because of his videos in the grand beatbox battle. Well deserved golden buzzer!
Lost a couple minutes of my life here..
Rubbish, I hate all that bangy screechy nonsense.
Le com français que tu cherches 🇫🇷
starting from 4:55, "angry juice bugs"
How I wish he would keep going for hours lol. This is amazing
Incroyable 😍😍
He was very late in showing up for this great purpose
Toe tapping time! He’s gooood.
I don't think any golden buzzer has made me this happy. It was absolutely brilliant performance. I love him.
MY MAN MB14....
You deserve it bruh!
Such great talent and character, and infectious smile.
MB14, qui a déjà fait The Voice France et The Voice All Stars est un génie du Beatboxing.
It would be a wonderfull life if all of people at leas have this positive energy,he's realy awesome guy👍💪🏽🙏❤💯❤

Now i'm hoping for MB14 and berywam together on a got talent stage
Never seen anything like this before. Crazy 🔥
The full package, producing, beatboxing, singing, keep it up god bless you
Truly exceptional!! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
You don’t need much to make music.
If this guy opens a club, he don't need a DJ.
He looks like Omar Khorshid when he smiles , his eyes and face. Of course no one is like Omar ,but he memorized me of him. And he is handsome and talented too.
NOW THATS TALENT!! 😜👏👏👏👏❤
He is a legend
Amazing
That has to be possibly the best ever BGT audition ever! Absolutely incredible talent and funny too. This is something that deserves to win, simply because it's so totally unique. Brilliant!
DEYUMMMMMM
So overproduced. Why all the slow mo etc. I found it difficult to be excited.
Looping is cool, but does electronic distortion count as beatboxing? i thought it ALL had to be vocal.
MB14 , YOU ARE AMAZING, YOU'RE A GREAT GREAT GREAT PERFOMANCE, .. ❤️❤️❤️👍👍
thats was ok but berywam the greatest forever
So Chad Kroeger left the band, diyed his hair to beatbox... Cool!!!😉
Can anyone tell me what title is the intro he used?
Need that on Spotify 😂
This is why this show will never get boring seriously this act is the gem goose bumps moment
This is absolutely AMAZING!!!! This guy is truly talented, can't stop playing it, one of the best golden buzzers, well deserved, Good Luck MB14🎤😃
Wow, this is talent at it's best!

Ant and Dec are so straight gay,it's adorable😘
Amazing love this guy!  Great pick by the boys, hope he goes all the way and wins!
Fav act so far this year
He is amazing. Just spent ages watching videos of him on The Voice France. All the performances were brilliant
It’s about time this community got some wider recognition. It’s great
Holy smokes that was incredible
Je suis trop contente pour lui, je l’ai jamais oublié depuis the voice.. bourré de talent ce mec
first saw his performance with a great battle against SARO year 2017,  what a journey for MB14, congrats!
He was a runner up on the voice France 😡
Et oui il est français ❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉
Bravo gars tu merites tellement !!!!!
I want David back man
Who knew Roman Reigns was this talented
omg my fav the voice France contestant
Amazing!!! Fabulous
I'm almost sure I've seen it in some edition of The Voice France
That's a one-man-band doing an entire band's job!
That was my favourite act EVER on BGT, he's so unique and different than anything I have ever seen before!

Imagine what they would think of D LOW
Il a dead ça 🙌

Best Golden Buzzer ever....2023 winner is here🤩
that's why he looked familiar from the mb14 vs saro video
That was one heck of an experience to listen to! Can't wait to see what he does next x
Loopers aint beatboxers. They literally thought he can make those sounds st the beginning when in reality he just used that board to make him sound like that
BBW CHAMPIONS
Incredible talent deserves this accolade. So amazing🎉🎉🎉
OUT IF THIS WORLD❤️❤️❤️ well deserved Golden Buzzer❤️❤️❤️
It reminded me of an ANCIENT BATTLE😍😍😍
I've never seen anything like this before! It's truly surprising!
mais QUI PEUT LE STOPPER EN FAIT ??? trop trop fort j'ai hâte de voir la suite de son parcours à BGT
I might think he is in gbb😢😢  I love him!!!❤❤❤❤❤😂
merci MB14. Toujours un grand plaisir de t'écouter. De ton titre de champion du monde beatbox Crew avec Berywam, the Voice à maintenant!!! un vrai showman merci merci merci
been following him for more than 5 years . He is an inspiration for beat box community.
Talent and an amazing personality
Awh man so happy for you  Looking forward to your journey of bgt ❤❤❤
Roman reigns show your true identity
Now that's talent... The best in BGT.. He wins it
His smile tho🤍
This got everyone on their feet, Arab vibes man.
WOW!!!
Congratulations, you have reached lvl 100 in talent
The cheering, the golden buzzer he deserves
Simon couldn't believe his botox
always smile...
It's wild how professional beatboxers show up to a talent show after winning world championsships, participating in so many different things, and even in his case - being a runner-up on THE VOICE with the loopstation  Also, for those reading, MB14 is an original member of Berywam (BEatness - RYthmind - WAwad - Mb14)
This made me so happy to see, MB14 has always been one of my favourite performers and it's beautiful to finally see him on BGT
Oh My...Whatta Talent!! Well deserved Brother!  Can anyone tell me what is the Loop station that MD14 is using in the performance?
Certainly the best version of his famous song, this guy was already a legend way before this performance !
MB14 has done so many things. One of the starters of BERYWAM, was on the voice, other shows, etc. Yet he did not name-drop anything to elevate himself, and relied purely on his talent to gain votes.  Big respect
He is amazing and one day I will be able to do that because I am a beatboxer myself and I try to do Egypt beatbox
Just when you thought you have seen it all in BGT...this show never fails to amaze or move me to tears... ❤️❤️
If it weren't for his good friend Saro he'd be a multiple loop world champion, so glad he gets to showcase his skills to a mainstream audience. Do not ruin him BGT, he's a world heritage site!
Wow. Amazing👏❤
Just seen this video vlog. If that is the standard of this program then I am glad I don’t watch it. Ridiculous and pointless
Well deserved MB14
Hes great. Check out Sam Perry. He won The Voice Australia as a loop artist. He's phenomenal
I don't think i've ever reacted the way I did watching him😭😭. This gave me chills.
Well deserved Golden Buzzer yoooooooooooooo!!!!!!✨✨✨✨✨✨🌟🌟🌟🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Even the mercury shakes me, he pushes so well...he's really talented!
He was awesome on The Voice France......check it out.....😊
Killed it 🔥
Mb14 a participé déjà à the voice France ( je me souviens plus de l'année), un grand artiste !
so many people on there already do this but its this guys time to shine
Talent AND humility... the perfect mix. Bon chance, MB14!
2:50 hé had me
I’m so full up with joy seeing this reception to beatbox🥲especially to such a deserving recipient in mb14👏
meanwhile Saro "hold my beer.."
That was 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
BRITAINS GOT TALENT YET HES FROM FRANCE....P1SSES ON THE WORD BRITAIN
Incroyable !!!! ESHHHH !!!! The guy who made me love beatboxing... truly one of a kind
OMG! He's absolutely incredible, LOVE IT!!!
Don't know why that judge was taking off his clothes 🤢
he seems soo sweet
MB14 juste un talent de fou !!! Bravo et continue …
MB14 from the voice France, he is great and deserves the golden buzzer.
I’m so glad he can finally get more eyes on him. I can’t wait for his other acts.
And the guy is fit 🤗
Just out of this world. AMAZING👏🏼👏🏼❤️❤️
Good, but give over with the over reactions. This fella has been scouted.  But also there are many more out there who are 100times better than this.
Irmão do dj alok kkkkk
Idk but not to be rude i feel like hes bing a BITTY sussy . Sorry man if im being rude . But i rlly like ur personality and ur talent . Probaby took years for u to actually beat box. I also love franceso i support u my guy. Carry on with the good work! :》
He’s amazing.🩵
I know some people think it's a fix but not bothered the guy is great 😁
Totally Deserved and what got him the Real Gold was " Baguette Croissant" AHAHA

BERYWAM WILL BE PROUD OF MB14!
واو اللحن في البداية كأنه عربي...مبروك له
French quality 🇨🇵♥️ MB14  represented 1000% my country 🤘🏻
To make those sounds with your voice! And to compose those sounds into unbelievably good music. And to perform all of that live without missing a beat! If there were 5 people up on that stage, it would have been amazing. THAT'S ONE GUY! THAT SHOULDN'T BE POSSIBLE!  Well done, most amazing thing I've seen.
Well-deserved!! 😭❤️
MB 14 is also a hoot. When Ant and Dec asked where he is from he said "France" which got Ant and Dec laughing. MB 14 quickly followed saying "Croissant and Baguette." Which only made Ant and Dec laugh louder. 😆🤣😂
Wow.. awesome, excellent, powerful, entertaining
I’m not a fan of beatboxing but dammmmmn 😃
Can these egotistical judges shut up for 3 minutes and let the performer shine .
Wow, everytime he blow my mind, keep it going MB14 you and Saro are the goats of loop station, sending love from Dubai 🫶🏻   If you guys dont know anything about loop station, please check different battles on youtube, and my favorite video is MB14’s  la cup worldwide showcase 2018. Out of this world performance. 🫶🏻
I'm just here for Amanda somehow
He's one of the Berywam also before The beatboxer Group
This music will bring dead man alive. You have to watch this with the highest highest literally the highest definition video quality. This is top class ... Bravo!!!
I agree with all of them, an unbelievable audition. Watch « opera » movie with this talentuous man ❤❤❤
信じられないパフォーマンスにびっくり！
Après the voice France et plus récemment Ténor je suis content de voir cette superbe prestation si justement récompensée ! Vous êtes exceptionnel 😘

He is really amazing talent in 2023😊
My inspiration... Mb14, saro, Tom Thumb... All these people have contributed a LOTTTT ij intrigrating a whole lot of a musician in me... Not jist a beatboxer... I'll forever owe them my gratitude ❤
Seems like a really nice guy on top of that insane talent, very likeable.

Big up! And don't forget the M of BerywaM was MB14!
I haven't seen anything like this...got an Arabian vibe!!

Inspiration?      /watch?v=kBfKhrZxqdQ   AuGT 5 years ago.
Tiktok brought me here 😂
He has been doing this for years, he is incredible.
For those who didn't know, his blind audition at The Voice (France) got now 95M views on YouTube. And he went through to the finals. He also is a former member of Berywam who made a great appearance at AGT, a beatboxing world champ, and an actor who got a main role in a film recently.  Speaking about talent, it's not even fair. 🤣
Bravo Mohamed tu mérites vraiment...chapeau.

MB14 WAS A ORIGINAL FORMER MEMBER OF BEATBOX CREW BERYWAM
Ahhh yes I know this guy!! From Berywam!! He's INCREDIBLE on his own though!!! Certainly one of the best if not the best looper in the world!!
Congratulation my maaaaaan 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️I have nothing to say, as always and every moment I am proud of you again🙏🏼❤️🥺

MB14 is just amazing, I can't stop myself from listening to it again and again.
The king !
simon "i dont know where youve been" well hes been on radio, the voice france, and the beatbox championships. hes quite widley available on youtube lol
so very cool
wow... he can produce for people
man's a walking talking DAW at this point
The sound was recorded and fixed by the instrument he used.
I need to hear his 'music' without sounds from audience
A BRILLIANT FUSION of Western beat box and Middle Eastern vocalization! What's not to *_LOVE!!!...???_* *_R_* 😎
wooow super talented this guy I really like it the way when he smile ❤️❤️❤️ love from philippines
Amazing
Please champion of Beatbox loop station come to AGT hahahah more contestants
Still one of the best loopstation tracks of all time. MB14 can perform the same routines over and over and they never get boring
As much as I’m glad that MB14 is getting recognition, wish that people would actually check out the beatbox scene, such as Sbx or bbx int😢. So many talented loopers, tag teams, and beat boxers that have yet to be known. But so glad and happy to see MB14 shine. Much luck! ESH! ❤🔥
Check out MB14 vs Saro
One of my favorite auditions in years 👏👏👏
Such a shame they had to insert a gay as a judge🙄 don’t know what’s wrong with people nowdays, it’s like they are worship them or something.
ESH!
OMG this man is damn talented and sexy as well 😢
He was awesome! I just wish the female judges would stop treating young men like a piece of meat. Men don't deserve that the same as women don't.
My God what a talent, got goosebumps from his music,❤️ Seeing this 1000 times, still it makes me dance, make more of this and shake the whole world with beats❤️❤️❤️
Dont get it.
MB14 you deserve everyone of those gold glitter pieces and more!
Fantastic! Extremely Talented and Stand Out Handsome humble man!
🎉 bravo!
Love MB14 he is a Talent ❤
HE IS AN ALIEN !!!!!! Super rrrrrrrrrrrrr❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Not sure the royal family will like this, no kids involved for Andrew and he's not white. Might be orite because the queen's died
Wait until you see how Tom Thum perform
you made it bro 😭
Simon can smell the money.
Simon Cowell thinking....your good but ain't money making 😂
berasa dengerin di padang pasir bareng Cleopatra
T.A.L.E.N.T!
MB14 is a legend of this era.
Do you know this sing called and the artist also
Tu le mérites vraiment MB14, tu seras a jamais le vrai gagnant de The Voice pour moi 👍
Beside his talented, he is sooo charming. There's something about his smile... 🥰🥰. God Bless You Mohammad aka MB14
Finaly he did BGT
I hav watched so many auditions on these shows,but ds one for me ws one of da best,phenomenal indeed’much love 💕 all the way 4rm South Africa 🇿🇦
Woooooooooooow❤❤❤❤
GREAT SMILE!!!
Very cool and unique. It's funny, bc as soon as he appeared on camera, I also said, "he has great hair."  Clearly, I wasn't alone in my thinking. 😊
A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! You got it!!  👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟♥️♥️♥️♥️
Mans got skills
I didn't expect this!! Just wow!!!!! I'd love to go to his concert one day.
I always think loopers are so talented that they can come up with all the break downs and they make them a masterpiece
Amazingly talented
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
you know you’ve won when you see simon do a slow clap
MB14 is a LEGEND in the beatbox scene  and   beoyned,  Everyone  just  know EVERY SINGLE   beatboxer and  fan of  mb14  is  jumping  up an down now  and the  BBX community just  Level  up cuz  of this
Crazy to see MB14 with a rendition of his Pyramids song on BGT
Fyi, MB14 is a former crew for the beatbox group Berywam that perform on the AGT. We can see that his name is imprinted in the group name, Be : Beatness, Ry : Rythmind, Wa : Wawad, M : MB14 👌
PMG I can't wait to hear more!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Looper won the voice, hope one wins here too. I'm not sure people truly grasp the sheer creative genius it takes to compose an amazing loop/song like this.
Ant and deck should have there own golden buzzer backstage so the they can press it and no judge or contestant would know and it would suprise the crowd and the judges
Just surprised that BGT judges have not heard of Loopers before.  Have seen Loopers win in Australia and taking part in France and Italy
Muhammad ❤❤
surprised to see this comment box is available. but the talent is far more surprising
MB14 yesssssss 🎉let’s go, !
Wahh mb14 onfire again he lagend
He is very handsome
Esh!!!! ❤️
Comment section so amazing...
he deserve it
Best audition ever. 🎉
You think this is good..... watch the Grand beatbox loopstation battle 2017 semi final with MB14 vs Saro. Saro is a whole different level!!
Hes been on the Voice France , even returned to another stint. By now he shoulda made it. 🥹🫧
I love mb14 after i watch their battle with saro eshhhhh!!!
Beautifull perfomance, beautifull smile
Mb14 ayee
His inspired by Tom Thum, but he is amazing!

Video watch & subscribe
WOW!! That was exciting! Loved it 😊
Will pay $250 to attend his concert.
Masya Allah, Mohammed, your talented 🩷🩷🩷
Simon 😮 😂😂😂😂😂
This round golden bluzeers are many kiss my comment🎉😂❤
The guy is certainly a Muslim, don’t force him to bow knowing that Muslims don’t bow to anyone but God. Still he was humble enough to tilt a bit.
When Simon says that an audition is one that nobody will ever forget, you know you freaking killed it.
Does anyone know what is the title of the song played when the golden buzzer?
It's amazing to see Berywam get so far in AGT, and now to MB14 get the golden buzzer on BGT. This is exactly the kind of thin I needed to brighten my day :)
yessssss..unbelievable..he is arabian blood?????😍
i can do much better than that . lmao
Damn….i had goosebumps
That was amazing well deserved
Wow
Wow 😮!Aside from being talented he's gorgeous ❤
Simon was visibly awe-struck 😂
SubhanaAllah it's the first time that I heard him says his name in big show . We are proud of him like fans that's he came finally here ❤
Very proud of this dude! I love him very much
How many times have you watched this? Yes
outstanding
👌👌
Lestgo bm14
LEGITIMATELY SO GOOD LIKE I CANT EVEN BELIEVE IT RN???
I thought I recognised him. He was on the Voice France. 7 years ago and did beat boxing to Gangsters Paradise. 3 chairs turned around.
That was totally Amazing....❤
Our hero from the beatbox scene and now he's jumping higher than the sun👆👆👆👆 We love MB14😍😍😍😍😍
Who is the winner this season ?
I have been watching him for soo many years, He is one of my favourite artist, checkout his album guys, the beatboxing community absolutely adores him, he is what you call a LEGEND in that realm.  Love you MB14
he will win the BGT for sure....
What in the Plavalanguna! SO TALENTED!!
I don't know where you've been... I've been in France🤣🤣🤣🤣
Simon 👁👄👁
OUTSTANDING PERFORMANCE WELL DONE. YOU GOT THE GOLDEN BUZZER. ❤
Damn mb14
De todo o coração e sem desmerecer qualquer outra audição, mas esse Golden Buzzer foi simplesmente o mais emocionante pra mim!!! Isso aí é TALENTO!! Nunca tinha visto beat boxing dessa maneira. Ele é francês, bonito e talentoso 🇫🇷 ❤❤❤
LoopStation Sales and Artist stock after this: 📈📈📈📈📈📈📈
We will bring Saro next year
MB14 🔥 Where can I buy this song??
Reminds me of when Russell Peters mentioned in his skit enjoying Lebanese underground music scene. He took over and brought in the culture to rock that crowd
MB14 has got to be one of my favourite loopers
جزائري
Mb14 is part of berywam
❤❤❤
I myself also don't know why I'm crying.. this guy is soooo amazing and wonderful laaaaaaaa👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Beautiful ❤smile,  great job
Wow... this is a talent
Wow mb14, he was the original member of BERYWAM
That wasn't an audition, it was a concert! LOVE IT!
It's awesome ❤❤❤ performance
He's absolutely incredible.  Such talent. I also loved seeing him smile throughout  his performance-he obviously loves what he does!  Well deserved golden buzzer!
If Simon Cowell shows a thumb up, it really means a lot
Can we get a moment of silence for the BGT Golden Buzzer Clean up Crew'
This is pure talent
This guy amazingly talented and gorgeous!
Winnie Wallace Not sure this is what it seems!!. How come when he moves the mike we still here the noises he's supposedly making..
Amazingly talented! Wow!
I could watch this over and over
Some raw some not like that of a flex petal for a guitar very cool awesome song
Literally the definition of a one man band lol
What the hell was it?! I have chills all over my body. WOW!!! Undisputed TALENT.
MB14
I already know MB14 is going to make this unforgettable.
HE IS GORGEOUS ❤😘😍💋
I'm not all that much into beatboxing, etc, but damn.. That was beyond good. Legit brought tears to my eyes w/ how much I enjoyed the sound & feel he pumped out. So glad they gave him the buzzer, I honestly think he's got the potential to at least hit the finals.
who has come from tiktok?
👍
mb14   THE OG!!!!!!!!!
Yea I came from tik tok
I wouldn’t be surprised if this guy won. He is amazing!
Well deserved ❤
I wonder how he would make a show out of this?
Remember the Australian guy who won on The VOICE? He was doing the same thing.
MA BRO MB14 BIG LOVE ❤
Background song name pleasee
if you're a fan of Beatboxing, u know that he is actually also a BERYWAM member back then. a very very very good beatbox group!
Ant and Dec always make the best golden buzzer decisions. He was AMAZING!!🎉🎉🎉
terribad
He's talented, he's ahndsome and hot plus he's french... wow!
MB14 finally getting recognized again, feel like alot of people forgot about him
Love all of it EXCEPT the , damn  awful MAN BUN. wish would go away from the pages of men's styles already.
Pure talent! I think we have a winner already 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Smurf
Biggest thing here is that MB14 did not go all out man 🔥
FINALLY MB14
I miss David
He's charismatic and mastering very well his machine and voice to get the best out of them. He desserve Golden Buzzer. This reminds me when Sidoine appeared to The Voice France 2019 Blind Audition
The Simon wink of approval always gets me for some reason 😊
Well deserved mega talented 👏
It's fake lol just audio he's miming
He used to be in berywam for those who know them
Awesome
I don’t think I’ve loved an act like that since Tokio Myers. That was cool af!
Love from France I saw on The Voice France ❤
I love Ant and Dec   Their golden buzzers are the best, this guy was so deserving of not only a golden buzzer, but an Ant and Dec golden buzzer ❤😊
Amazing voice 😊
That has to be some kind of voice changer! He did so good!!! Well deserved💖🎉
Mujhe farhan akhtar laga 😆
Now we got the whole entire Berywam crew on the Got Talent spotlight :D As part of the beatbox community watching GBB and all the online battles, this is a big moment. Congrats MB14.
MB14 can create any good villain theme ngl🥶
The shock on simons face is unreal
I would love to see Robin getting this type of recognition for what he does but MB14 is certaintly one of the bests beatboxers with a loopstation, i hope it does well of BGT
Congratulations Mohamed Belkhir ( known as MB14) Golden Buzzer Well deserved
First , Im not a fans beatbox , but he's talented, bravo ! Sec , I like his dress Thirty , he's smile so sincere Four , humble Deserve get GB , see u next 👍
Amazing!!! I can't wait to see   and hear more from this man!!!!!
This guy is amazing ♥️👌 can't wait to see his next performances 👍
The best beatbox performance I've ever heard in my life! Truly amazing!
❤❤❤❤❤🔥
The looper guy!
my best act to ever watch
I dont get why they havent heard of him though Im in New York and Ive known about MB14 for so many years. I first saw him on the Voice France many MANY years ago and Ive followed him ever since. Maybe thats why Simon hasnt heard of him? He seems to have a real aversion to The Voice. But honestly I know a lot of people who know who he is and Im glad more people will learn
He deserved his golden moment and every comment from the judges...Spectacular performances ✨️
Ant and Dec seen you both at the coronation today you both we’re looking very Dapper.
Amazing 😎😎😎
Bring back David Williams, BGT is not the same without him.
So glad he came to BGT.  I remember watching him on the voice France 🇫🇷.
OH MY GODDDDD REAL MB12
i have watched this guy for many years on you tube. very talented
MASYAALLAH MUHAMMAD ❤️🙏
My favorite, my inspiration.. MB14 ❤
This guy is very famous. He did the finals with the Voice France. He tried in many places and he is so desperate for success as he is not really a specialist in anything. He is a good mix of many things though but he doesn't deserve to win. Everything looked so staged here.
After being on the voice of France twice with one time being an all star, he might finally get the breaks he deserves
Well deserving!
YOU DESERVED EVERYTHING ❤️
I love mb14 man
MB14 deserves!
Simon looks like he is flabbergasted
Off the hook amazing
A real beatboxer could do beats and harmony or vocals at the same time without a machine to do it for them.
Way to go bro on the golden buzzer fromm gbb to this well deserved bro congrats!!!!
Yes, MB14! Best looper ever!!!! Been to the finals on The Voice twice and now you're here! So happy for you!!
Just. Incredible!!🤯
I agree that this guy is quite talented. I am, however, wondering whether or not his act can carry a full show. does he sing in a more traditional manner? Like sing a song.
Ive been waiting for him to show up on agt or bgt haha. One of the best beatboxers and loopers
now I understand why he left berywam.
Finally MB14 deserves the recognition he deserve for ages! You gotta love this guy even more after this
bro i got goosebumps
MB14 ✨❤️❤️
Incredible!
Netta aproves this !!!
Talented and humble great combo Rock on
Wow, what an amazing talent !
What a fantastic performance well done guys pressing the golden buzzer ❤
I can´t believe he actually performed this routine here
MB14 is a parts of Berywam
I've seen his VDO few months ago and I blew away by his talented, can't believe he join BTG. He deserved the golden buzzer.
Good thing Saro isn’t in the competition😂
Great stuff but we need Walliams back.
Amazing talent
His talent is hypnotizing, tho the red coat judge is so cringey.
Young, sweet person, nice, talented, authentic AND ladies, yes, he's handsome with the smile & the hair! Vraiment, il est très bon et il est très beau!
The best 😘😘😘😘😘 sooooo farrrr
Wow 🥺😳
MB14 has inspired us to listen to different style of music and he was just so creative and very unique in so many different ways he was so good I was then left speechless
YOU´RE ROCK!! HOLY MOLLY!! VERY WELL DESERVED!
SARO is kicking himself lol
He’s handsome, he’s humble, has a great personality and super talented ❤❤❤❤
Super Amazing Talent MB14👏👏👏👏👏🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
MB14 is one of the most hardworking person I've seen. He's also very much respected for not using loop synths and being raw. Truly a talented being he is.
I love him too
Very talented and a beautiful smile
His gangsta's paradise audition in the voice is a certified classic ✨
If you into beatboxing you knew this guy.
I've seen him on the Voice France....awesome performer.
🎶🎶come eat couscous, come eat couscous 🎶🎶
4:39 OMFG HE DID NOT JUST DO THAT
I dont like the vibes of this new judge
He's alone. BUT seems like a lot of  musicians behind him! He's only one on the stage. Unbelievable.... So good music.
MB14 is already et Big star in France, but you'r not ready of what is capable ! ❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤ love 💕💕💕💕
Britain's got talent should be named clever people but rubbish Saturday night entertainment.
WOWOWOWOWOWOOWOWOWWW
MB14! What an audition! Well deserved Ant and Dec Golden Buzzer. I have seen a clip of him on The Voice France 🇫🇷.  He was awesome! Good luck MB14!
I hope he wins!! This is talent! He seems so humble too!
Just love when i see beatboxers from gbb audition to got talent to share their music❤❤❤ Love from japan!!! ESH!!
Congratulations for receiving the golden buzzer 🎉🎉🎉
Amazing. One of the best auditions I've seen i absolutely years. There's only so many choirs and dance groups you can watch without getting bored, BGT always used to have really unique auditions, this is one of them.
Great, great, great talented performer and of course he deserve the Golden Buzzer. Can't wait to see what next.
Wish I could watch the whole program in the U. S.
What a Performance
Sensacional ❤
I dont know any ‘bout beatbox but this dude deserve hall of fame ❤️‍🔥

One of my favourite beatboxer, So happy for you 😭❤

Uhm wtf did I just watch? That was BEYOND INCREDIBLE!!! WOWWW 😍❤️

The last audition will be on the 27 May on ITV and the live semi finals will start on the 29 May on ITV🎉🎉🎉🎉 can’t wait for the live semi finals to start
Whenever the judges said never seen this before, then I suddenly realized I've been watching too much YouTube.
Now that I’ve traveled through space and time. I can die happy now
Known this guy for years from just a loopstation artist to making to the voice France and now here. There is still a long way to him. Hope he gets what he want! Huaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh
Him back again🎉
Awesome performance, MB14 !! You deserve to be the champion! 👑

MB14 original member  Berywam but he left and pursue his solo  career and replace by Beasty
Let's go MB14!!🔥
What is going on here. Superb
Mb14 vs saro one of the great beatbox battles you should watch it
He's member berywarm right?
I first saw MB14 when he battled Saro and in my opinion is the most legendary loop station battle the world has ever seen. Im so happy to see him perform at BGT.
He was on The Voice!
Mb14 still a sick artist 🔥
I feel as if I am at an Arabic-Indian party. Superb performance! He looks like Jesus with great hair too. I loved it. All the best!
Ah oui...encroyable!
Roman reigns can do some dope beatbox...kidding but this man is great
ARABIC
Amazing
This is not an audition.BGT should pay him for his performance
like that!
Big love for beatbox community, MB14 one of most talented beatboxers
Sound machine right in front of him
Why is he standing so far away from the stage? 6:15 🤔
So he’s like the guy from Australia Voice on Kelly’s team.  Sam Perry
He reminds me of a young John Travolta appearance-wise. Such a cool performance!
LOVED THIS, omg……. 🔥❤️🔥
Trust me this performance is nothing as compared to what MB14 can bring 🤩 I have been following him since 5 years almost, this guy is truly talented with amazing voice 🥰
The real beatbox masters leafing in ther houses 😂😂😂😂
I ve benn waiting yeaaaaars to see Mohamed on AGT god bless u bro!!
Been following him since the voice ! So happy for him 💕 !! Go Mb14 ! It was a well deserved golden buzzer!!
HYPNOTIZING! MESMERIZING! That was fire! 👏👏👏🤮🤮
Atleast ant and dec picked somthing diffrent unlike the other 4 judges but i still cant say iv seen anything worth winning yet i liked the strippers but thats not going to win
That is talent ! Wow ! He is also really nice and humble. Kind of person you want for friend. I wish him the best of luck ! Un gros bonjour du Québec !  ❤️🙏
By far the best act we have seen this season, an amazing talent, can’t wait to see more of him.
Finally they have found the "real" talent! I'm a fan of his beatbox since the release of his Pyramids song
eklips from aliexpress :D
Mohammed, you are either Algerian or from Morocco and you should not be ashamed of saying that. Don't try to hide your name or your identity I felt you were shy or hesitant and I felt you did not want to say your real name Be proud my friend you have the most amazing name on the planet.
I would love to see what he and Ren Gill could do together.
Ladies and gentleman, your BGT 2023 winner I am calling it RIGHT. NOW!
That' was beyond my imagination, Thank You ❤️ MB14 great Talent...
He is going to blow up BGT for sure 🔥🔥🔥🔥
i really think he will make it
Many other acts deserved the golden buzzer! Travis was one, plus many others to name
Finally ppl finding out about mb14
Muhammad
The guys okay but I so wish beardyman would come to BGT
anyone who has been interested in beatboxing surely have heard about this guy. he's amazing. and I expect even more from him
one of the best performances I've ever seen on this show
Incredible beat boxing

can't wait to see the next performance 🔥
This beatbox is the best i ever heard in my life,OmG
Absolutely LOVE this and all the reactions from everyone, truly thank you for making my day❤
What a hunk ! His performance was incredible!
He would give Kevin from Pentatonix a run for his money.  He would make a great addition to the Pentatonix group.  I hope they see this performance and gives him a call.
Well desserved..👏👏👏👏
He’s gotta win this year for sure 🔥
Sounded great. Reminds me of when I first watched a video of Imogen Heap looping on a TV show, "Say goodbye and go" back in 2007. But the choral style was stupendous.
if they had any clue that he is a LEGEND and they got to experience a free concert from MB14 ......
Oltre che stra stra bravo sei un figo allucinante
MB14 is a legend! Well deserved 🙏
Michael winslow? ❤️
Wow wow wow 😍

That was class 👏👏
Oh wow Mohammed you made it 🥳
✨✨His talent ✨✨ 🦋✨His smile ✨🦋
Keren
he is going to win this show!
Mika would be proud
Just phenomenal!!!!👍
On top of being incredibly talented and good looking, there's something very warm and inviting about this guy's energy that I really think will blow up his career sooner than later. He's got the vibe of a friend you've known for a long time, even though I'd never seen him in my life before tonight.
back beat and samples his vioce live plays it on a loop chucks in a hip hop beat thats the layer cake of beats well done that man x
🎉 i love you 💙💙 from Thailand 🇹🇭
So glad to see one of the best loopers in the world to be granted an amazing opportunity like this ❤️. ESHHH

Been watching MB14 and Saro for years both anazing glad to see him getting recognition on this level well deserved
I've had a lot of beatboxers but his ability to scratch so perfectly like that blew me away and the instrumental noises were amazing as well best I've ever heard
If this is guy is for real, I have to admit he is insanely talented.
The world's best sound master
This guy is amazing. He’s obviously very talented… he’s definitely got a gift. & let’s be honest everyone, he is one beautiful looking man! GOOD FOR HIM!!!
Saro still kills mb14 😅

MB14 has revolutionized beatboxing and looping for a very long time. Glad to see him get the recognition he deserves.
La France on est laaaa
They need to chill on the slow motion edits and fake 😮 reactions from the judges 😂
WoW, this guy was so Amazing, I keep watching this many times, Love it🥰🥰🥰
I remember seeing him auditioning to The Voice France few years ago, and then I saw him starring in a movie 1 year ago, I have this impression that only few people care about what he does in France and I’m so happy for him that he went to BGT because there, finally, people see how talented he is!!! Well done MB14!!!!
Well deserved Golden Buzzer💯
throwing up gang signs
Now THIS is talent.
He’s gonna be the winner of This season..Mark my words..Take a screenshot.
He is an awesome guy and the performance was great, but isn't anyone else wandering why the sounds continued even when he started a new one and how did the machine play in all of this? I'm honestly confused.
Allahuakbar my brader MB69😢 May Allah grant u the victory in jihad😢 Everyone literally hipnotized by your music Eventhough Allah haram music😢
He's been on the voice France 🤔
Well deserved.. Congrats
PUT THIS IN SPOTIFY!
My favorite contestant ever  in The Voice France
j'adore  cette artiste il est extraordinaire autant artistiquement que humainement Félicitation tu le mérites
I know this artist for more than 5 years. He was on The Voice of France (many views on YouTube) and a well known face in the Beatbox World (just search for MB14 vs Saro with so many views). He was also a former member of Berywam, so at least Simon could have known him. I am happy for the artist, but the show is messed up, they invited him, I am sure about it
OMG he made the perfect time to do this all throughout the years...He deserve this and more...💚
He is fabulous!! Well done 😄
This level of talent is incredible
I'll tell you what _real_ talent is, Simon Cowell managing to act surprised at 6:11 despite his face being 90% botox.
Now THAT was SPECtacular! He's mega-talented. I predict he'll win the whole thing or come very close.
This guy is a showman!👌 👏   Congratulations 🎊  Berywa(mb14) legend 🙌
ESH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Where are these people now? So much talent but unfortunately under the radar ❤
Incredible ❤
Anyone who knows anything about beatboxing would know mb14. F off bgt taking beatboxing now
About time beatbox gets the attention it deserves
Well done moha
Unbelievable  !
You made it brother couldn't be prouder much love from New Zealand brother
Bon, nous en France on lui a fait passer toutes les étapes pour arriver à la finale de The Voice. Les britons, eux, perdent pas de temps, il y va direct 😂 MB14 is so talented that it is well-deserved! Sam Perry was so good in Australia, I wish the same ending for our frenchy in the UK!
Wala pang nag gaganyan sa pilipinas
The more it goes on, the more you realise this is utter FIRE 🔥 ❤
Well deserved! Bravo Guys, Bravo!!
See... You can get golden buzzer without sob story.
I was so privilidged to be at BGT when this happened and watch it irl. I hope he wins.
Amazing!! Very happy to see MB14 on BGT!! Rooting for him to win!!!
Amazing!
He used to be part of berywam
How does he make all those sounds with his mouth, its incredible
This is something anyone can do by using a vocal synthesizer.  A vocal synthesizer just means that we are using the human voice as the instrument that is being synthesized.   The human voice is already the perfect instrument, but a synthesizer can change the function of the human voice and the instrument itself.
mb14 was always my favorate in loopstation . well done man . deserved goldenbuzzer
Woooow, the whole package!👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋 Chapeau!
This kind of talent is rare. I know that this is new to everyone. Where a perform pulls you into their world. Well deserved 👏👏
Absolutely amazing 👏 😍 ❤️ 👌 🙌 💖 👏 ❤❤❤❤❤😊😊😊😊
Let’s get ready to Rumble.
MB14 I love you brother that's a real TALENT ... I give you my Golden Buzzer 🏆
Reggie Watts is the G,o,a,t
ISSO, é INJUSTIÇA com muitos q passaram por esse programa e não foram contemplados com o "botão de ouro" quando mereceram! Esse cara, vem fazer essas prezepadas e ganha  o "botão d ouro" só porq fizeram todos dançarem? Juízes e jurados no mundo todo, são injustos e FALSOS!
Proud of you MB
I see the rest of the world come to UK, they need to have the same opportunity where they hail from.
Trucking amazing and easy on the eye 💕
I would buy this! Amazing! Added to my Likes.. :o)
Great video, trading come with a lot of benefits And I have just brought my first house through it. As a beginner I was scared of loosing my savings but I'm glad I took the bold step that is now favoring me
Je suis tellement fière de MB14 et de sa bravoure pour relever le challenge à BGT. J'ai eu mal au cœur lorsqu'il n'avait pas gagner the voice France mais ça ne l'a pas empêché de gravir d'autres étapes. J'espère que son talent brillera encore dans d'autres contrées que la France.
I HATE that the audience is always clapping over this piece of art.. Its so annoying, and ruins the enjoyment somewhat...
MB14 is so amazing!! I saw him on the voice of France. You gotta love Ant and Dec!!!
That’s a talent man, this guy is the winner.
was he not on the voice
So glad to see MB14 on here, he's the best!
Amazing One !!!!!!! thank for sharing beatbox  !!!
Getting sam Perry vibes from him
common ant n dec W
THATS AMAZING  WHEN i AM GOING TO GET THE GOLDEN BUZZER IN MY REAL LIFE
Did anyone notice the wink from simon, he might actually remember when berywam auditioned on americas got talent😂
Oh yes MB 14 is one of the best old school loopers in the world , check his videos and battles with other competitors in Beatbox Comunity Channels thanks , from Beatbox Croatia Comunity 🇭🇷👋👋❤❤❤❤
Bleddy 'ansum that is.
WOW! AMAZING!
As a guy i kinda have a crush on him hes so likeable
MB14 on BGT and Lord of the Lost on Eurovision...I'm in a happy place!
THANK YOU 🙏😊❤️ Let’s make history together ! ⭐️⭐️⭐️
I think that for his talent, BGT might be more suitable than the voice. Good luck!
❤❤❤MB14🎉🎉🎉
Neta the singer from isreal do it first  This guy  talented to
Fantastico
Bravo  bravo  the  true  talent ❤❤❤❤❤
Yes it sounded good but how much was him and how much was electronically enhanced? These days with technology if you know how you can create almost anything....is this talent? Could a person with no talent come out and perform aided by technology and it seem great?
MB14 isn't just a beatboxer he's an incredible showman. He's gonna shake up the world :)
Love your smile 😊😊
Go after the dream  man😊😊😊
Magnifique, tellement mérité. Un monstre reconnu à sa juste valeur.
Really Good 😊😊😊
Fantastico 💫💫💫💫💫
Wasn't he apart of Berywam earlier??
GO MB14!! So talented and hes always consistently improved over the years.. I'm so happy to see him get the recognition he so deserves.. LETS GO!

I'd like to see him duet with Stromae
MB14 is a legend  Glad he’s here
He is winner BGT 2023  Definitely 🎉
Amazing 🫂🙏🤩
Why did he need that keyboard thing for ? I bet anyone can do that , change their voices. Couldn’t he do all that without that keyboard thing he just needed the micro
Well deserved 🎉🎉🎉now why am I crying 🥺
Newcastle….golden money 💰
He's my favourite beatboxer 👍😍 His Gangstar Paradise version is dope
I love him so much❤

MB14 one of my idols of all time. Actor : check out his film "Tenor", very talented and I hope he plays again and again in other films and series Beatboxer : GBB level (Highest competition of beatbox) and ex member of the most famous beatbox group of all time Berywam <3 Singer : finalist of the Voice France and he totally deserved to be a champion Looper : Also GBB level and was one of the favorites  Musicien : this man just realized my dream of looping in Got Talent Shows, what a performance ! <3  WHAT A TALENT !
BRILLIANT !!
Real ones know him from Berywam. (Havana)
Amazing talent❤❤❤
Phenomenal! He is a master of his craft!
Well done. Great performance!
This geezer was great he deserves 4 golden buzzes, actual talent.
Want to come back and remember this comment.

sіm᥆ᥒ һᥲძ 𝗍᥆ ᑲᥱ ᥱm᥆
omg his smile is so contagious and beautiful
He was fantastic
He deserved it.
From France 🎉🇫🇷 …. Félicitations 👏🏽 superbe audition! Quel talent 😮
Wow
Mind. Blowing!! Well deserved golden buzzer ❤
MB14 out here sharing the greatness of loopstation music with the world, love it. I first discovered it through Beardy Man but man there are so many talented Loopers out there and MB14 is one of them!
I invented beat boxing. This guy is pretty good, but obviously not as good at me, because I invented beat boxing. In fact I trained mb and he's my mate. I'm proud of you MB. Well done.
Toujours aussi incroyable ce gars
That's looping not beat boxing
Big fan already!!!🎉
Simon couldn't have said it better... I saw beatboxing gets golden buzzer, i'm like it's going to be something unheard of and unimaginable.  Incredible performance.
He so cute ❤
The best of the best…
Congrats Mohammad🎉
Deserved it but bgt is 100% staged
For those who know him like me, from watching all the beatbox contests hes the best and the most creative beatboxer. I cant imagine what people dont know him have to feel :D
Well well, now that's talent
Winner..right there, he's going to win, he's so unique, so skillful, I'm sure he's spent hours honing his craft. He's my choice to win BGT this year.
Don’t usually comment BUT WOW - winner winner chicken dinner 2023
Wow!!! I did not expect that! It is awesome!  I have watched it 10 times and counting! What a great talented musician!
At less he improved since The Voicd France. Sad that a performer can't do anything else then just compete again and again from one show to an other
He's very handsome and talented I love you MB14
You are the bommmm!!!!
Truly a class act! Amazing 🇬🇧💯
Didnt think france was part of britain.....o yeah its not 😂
Now that, that was talent and extremely different to anything we have seen on BGT. He is so slick, he's entertaining. What a performance 🎉👏👏👏
That is one of the best bit of beatboxing I've ever heard absolutely smashed that fair play 💕👌
Following him since 2017 ..... This had me in tears.... He's the best ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
fellow beatboxers who knows him from berywam and GBB where are  u fam
That was amazing and he is so beautiful on the eyes 👀 as well 😊
Never seen anything like that ❤❤❤
OMG MB14😮😮😮
Look his smile so sweet so soft i love him
Well-done ❤️❤️
This has to be one of my number one favorite auditions ever. That guy was simply amazing.
That’s Winner
Simon expression is priceless
For all these people it is totally new and ive watched and heared this guy for years... There are a lot of talents in the beatbox / loopstation scene!  Happy for him, he deserves it and nice people will maybe into this kinda music/art.
Dude is so sexy. He has the charisma and charm combined with loads of talent.
🇩🇿❤
Without the repeater i would have liked it but I don't like the fact you can put layers because in the end it will always sound nice. I don't like that, it was nice but without the repeater im kind of like a fan, with them I'm not
no pity story. THAT IS PURE TALENT
Ant and Dec are always good with their golden buzzer
I still remember his battle against Saro, 6 years ago I think? What a talent. Well deserved!
Full on Tom Thum rip off!
An absolute One-of-a-Kind.  That was phenomenal.
Is he the same mb14 vs saro, mb14?
He deserved the golden buzzer.
It's not that big of a surprise,  I'm sure he's been a world champion in beatbox
This is why I’ve said for years beardyman should’ve gone on bgt. He’s better than this guy I know think yet is still well underrated
This is why I’ve said for years beardyman should’ve gone on bgt. He’s better than this guy I know think yet is still well underrated
MB 14 !  You are just amazing  There is no question about you  🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹👍👍👍
So great to see mb14 getting some recognition around the world. Been following for years. amazing
Oh yea, people still dont know about beatbox and loopsations :D
He is simply incredible good 😮
I'm never impressed by beatboxing, but this was nuts
He was finalist of the voice France
This is actual talent unlike the boring singing or dancing ones
Crazy how many people are unaware of the looping scene.
Amazing performance ❤❤❤❤❤❤ i love you so much
Imagine MB14 bringing D-low on stage for a future performance. I couldnt ask for anything more.
Wish MB14 will win in  BGT 2023
conheço ele há um bom tempo, simplesmente incrível!!!
Really amazing talent
When Simon is flabbergasted then it's good i love how he beatboxing with a new vibe it's well deserved the golden button 🎉🎉
Absolutely Amazing🎉👏👏
What has simon Coyle done to his face🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
This has to be the winner.
Omg...wow
Imagine actually going to the show and standing up dancing. Haha weird
Look at you MB14 , I loved you from the voice france I’m happy for you you keep chasing your dreams ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Wow, superb performance. Great talent. Love it.
liron liron sinta ....
🌟🤩👍
wowowow i rewatched it a dozen times .. i could listen to that all day :)
at 5minutes my a55 wwas outta my sit, face looking cringey but good cringey at the damn vibeeeeeeee
Yeah !!!
_I was absolutely mind blown!! I’m glad he was last, I don’t think anyone could top his performance. I hope he wins! Couldn’t stop smiling_
His name is Muhammad
He is not french he is algerian kabyle living in france
A real performance 💯
Damn, this guy was the original member of Berywam where M stands for MB14. He left the group to pursue solo career after he participated in the Voice of France and gained popularity.  Simon has already met Berywam in AGT but not MB14 though.   I always wanted him to showcase in the got talent shows.   Imagine the amount of TRP BGT is gonna get because of him!
Dlow should be on this
If i was among the judges, I would have pressed the Golden Buzzer in the middle of performance because MB14 deserved it
This guy is making musical instruments history here ❤
Terbaik dan saya terus mengulang untuk menonton nya tanpa bosan
Outstanding! Incredible Talent and intensely moving! Rock on MB14!
i cant wait for more people to listen to him in uk like Berywam in the us mb14 is amazing on the loop hope he wins lets go MB14 ESH ESH ESH!
Benar benar bakat. Kalo nggak jadi pemusik pun. Dia juga bisa model dari posturnya. Iklan sampo tuk rambutnya 😁
Geweldig.. good voice end tricks.
Wow! I only hope that he stays grounded in his success and that he give thanks to God for giving him this talent. Bless him!
MB14 I've been following you for years. You're absolute talent🤟
I have watched this audition more than 6 times and yet I don't feel like I saw it previously 😊waoo
What can I say.  Insanely Good !
That beat was sick i want a full version of it
MB14 passe en 45 tours mdr 😂
Talented.👍👏❤️
very talented but except for this guy how average has this show got !
What yhe hell has silly Simon done to his face
Now I had to replay that TWICE!!
i mean the guy is good but this is meant to be a talent show for your average british person. Not anyone from any country to fly over and prove their talent, espeically someone who has previously been on the voice, performs in professional beatbox battles and has already got a successful career in doing so. Why was this guy allowed on the show, the core point was for the british public to be able to perform and have a chance at stardom. like Susan Boyle for example.
I don’t think I ever heard him before   He does have great hair to be honest sorry Ant&Dec   I think I am going to watch this many times because Ant&Dec golden buzzer   I was shocked and surprised at the same time I have never heard that before now that is talent for sure
This guy is like a machine. Who needs a PC and drum machine when you can do this with your voice?
did someone say "cheap band"?
He So Deserved That Golden Buzzer
I hope he wins
😮  😲
If you liked that, try Sam Perry from The Voice.
Woow
I'm absolutely sick of all the boring singers on this show!  I'm not familiar with this guy, so when he said he was another singer I rolled my eyes.  Then he began, and I was gobsmacked at the beautiful sounds coming out of him. This is what you call talent!! He is the winner of this year surely. He stands out from everybody else who has been put through so far! Plus, he's gorgeous 😊
I like that he's bringing new tricks to something thats already intimidatingly difficult at the hiighest levels.  And a different cultural influence.
amazing, he is a Former Berywam members i think
An incredibly gorgeous man, made so by that smile! Congratulations, well deserved
BRITAINS GOT TALENT..  Hi where you from? ‘France’  Makes sense
Amanda Holden's face looks awful since her face lift!!!!
Jazakallah for representing Muslims ☪️
My absolute favorite reaction from simon cowell
So talented
It is so pleasure that i know him since 2016 ,he is humble and  i liked how discribed himself " all voice can you hear from my mouth" OMG
You know it's good when Simon says great 3 times
MB 14 (Mohamed Belkhir) was on the Voice France ( Mika’s finalist 5 years ago) and also participated in the Voice Allstar a couple years back. He’s very active in international competitions of freestyle rapping and is the main character of the French  movie TENOR about a guy from the hoods passionate about singing opera.  I can’t believe Simon has not heard about him. But hey, he turned down MIKA’s demo tapes back in 2006.
Legal
So crazy I had to watch it again. Couldn't believe my eyes 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
When his jaw drops, the rest of the audience does as well. What a brilliant performance.
I’m rooting for him to win 👍
MB14 has taken beatboxing to a new level. He also was a part of "The voice" show twice. You can check it out ❤ He is just brilliant
MB14 AWEMAZING TALENT ❤😊😅👍💯😜
SARO LEGEND LOOP 😂😂😂
He's amazing!! 🙌🏽
you could see  how  mesmerized   Simon  was !   well done  MB14  ESH!!
This guy was absolutely brilliant.  I loved the music as well.
Bro has a Stormtrooper name 😅
He is the principal actor for the movie "TENOR" is a good movie watch it
Bonjour croissant baguette LOL
I remember him when he was in The Voice France. He is a great person with fantastic talent. good to see him again. By the way, he is originally from Morocco 🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦
Simon's face at 4:54 was so funny lol.. he's like "wtf is even happening"
RESPECT ! <3
That was otherworldly
So, amazing to listen.. so talented
Some of the fakest people on tv
VIVE LA FRANCE !
Lvl 100
Goosebumps performance
Finally MB14 gets a recognition he deserves! So happy for that he showed his talent and Golden Buzzer!!!
I could listen him all night. Brilliant
🔥💯
Beatbox sounds and effects convey real art.
Wow what a handsome, talented and humble guy
I'm fan of MB14 since a long time.. watching you here is totally phenomenon.. thank you so much bro ❤️
I love beatboxing 🔥 Dave Crowe is insane as well
I knew him when he was little, and now he flies. How nice. You did it
Ed SheepRan needs this guy to eliminate any future copyright issues
he is a bit famous in france with " the voice " and after the voice  also as an actor in the cinema with the film:  Tenor  (2022) good movie it's weird to see him in bgt ..in fact no it's not weird because he has a lot of talent (sorry for my english im french)
ESH!!!
A French who speak english is the real talent
I have been watching him for years on the Swizz beatbox channel already and with his lovely group, I'm so happy that he came on BGT, Proud of him
So glad I don't watch this show any more
He was on The Voice - France in 2016
fun fact : He is former member of BERYWAM . He left berywam to pursue his solo career and he is making it 100% .  👏👏👏👏amazing Beatboxer and Looper .
meanwhile "dj's" who insert a usb stick and press play are flying private jets while making millions
I prefer Saro. But MB14 deserved the golden buzzer. That was sick
This was so good, I want it as a recording I can blast and jam to! Brilliance personified!
Another golden buzzer not british on Britain’s got talent?
Absolutely captivating...reminds me of The voice Australia....Sam...covering when the Doves cry by prince...congratulations...such a phenomenal talent
Ant & Dec’s Golden Buzzers are amazing 🔥
Never give up no matter what😎👊
Best act of the series so far ❤
Omg he looks so different..
"...the fact that you've got nice hair"-Alesha Dixon 2023
Brilliant, I have goosebumps, WOW,  Bravo mon cher😍
its MB14 and beatbox, idk why the people its like... OMG, and the music its inspired on Pyramid and other musics
Handsome and talented 🤔..that's a full package ❤😊
I’m calling it, he’s deserves to win
Is there a "Please Leave Button" for Bruno? 🫣
Absolutely fantastic !! Had me moving and smiling hard! He has a beautiful smile too!
I’m so effing cynical but this is a gift he shares. Incredible talent.
OUIIIII TELLEMENT MÉRITE PUTAIN ENFINNNN
*i see no one in the comments who realized who this guy is ! he performed on the voice's stage few years ago and performed gangsta's paradise*
Great performance. However a bit frustrating sometimes with the ignorance, this is nothing new. Also - ironic that the king of loop box is British; Beardyman.
was he playing all those beats and all those musical sound from his own mouth?   was it  not he was humming while the background music played/??
Makes me proud to be British
One of the best beatboxing auditions I have seen so far this decade on any Got Talent! Congratulations MB14! Well done, Ant & Dec on picking an excellent Golden Buzzer act!
MY GUY!!!
موهبة رائعة يا محمد excellent talent mohamed .talentueux Mr Mohamed ♥️🇲🇦♥️🇲🇦♥️🇲🇦♥️🇲🇦♥️🇲🇦♥️🇲🇦♥️🇲🇦♥️🇲🇦♥️🇲🇦♥️👍👍👍👍👍👍👍🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🎖🎖🎖🎖🎖
This is freaking B R I L L I A N T‼
Salute ant and decs
Ant and Dec aren’t on the judging panel but they have the best eye for talent out of all of them, they always nail it with their golden buzzers
Am feeling shaking right now oh my God his my favorite wow
This guy doesn’t need instruments, instruments need him. Stunned all the judges, my fav was Bruno 3:23
Progressive pop,rock,hip-op and all the other genres lives on
Been watching mb14 for a while on gbb very talented
MB14 = BEATBOX GOD
WOW
His smile is so pure and faithful..
Trop fière de toi MB14, bravo
Dude this guys got RAAAAAAAANNNNGEEE 😮😮😮😮
MB14 fighting!
Powerfull
So it’s not done all by his mouth then
Big con. Hes more famous than you. Over 10 million views on youtube. All for using a loop machine. Amanda knew her golden buzzer before. Complete fix of a program that's had its day.
I think Simon really wanted to press the golden buzzer lol
When Simon said truly deserved not others words required 😅
he was on the voice france did gangasta paradise
I remember him from the voice and he is a good singer tooo. Deserved for a golden buzzer ! He can show moreee ❤
I have been watching Mohammed since 2017 he is one of the greatest beatboxers in the game and a huge inspiration for alot of beatboxers. You deserve this brother 🙌❤️
his name is mohammed? So i assume he’s muslim? Is he married?   👀👀❤️‍🔥
For me to look for this on youtube is saying alot about this guy.  One of the best performances I’ve  seen. The plucking sitar sound with the percussion and harmonized vocals then the drums drop and then and the bass line comes in (if you’re wearing headphones) then record scratching with BGT vocal stab.  This was properly put together. I’ve listened to this about 20 times already.
4:54 When You discover the beatbox loopstation for the 1st time...
MB14 you are absolutely gorgeous 👏👏👏💪💪💪❤️❤️❤️🎉🎉🎉 you’re like a disco machine 🤩🤩🤩
huh david quit?
MB14 LEGEND!
He’s so cute ❤❤
A magic year for BGT.  Act after act bringing the world together
Wow, what a nice guy with such a talent 💯👌🏻
Every time there's the Golden Buzzer occasion, the audience move slowly. Believe me, I was there. No special effects required! LOL!
I'm glad that a muslim guy got the golden buzzer, he looks like a nice guy too
The train Eurostar 🎉
Quel talent !! Si spécial !! Si unique !! J'ai adoré Il mérite vraiment le gold buzzer !! 👍👍👏👏
“I’m from France. Croissant. Baguette.” 😂 such a funny guy LOVE him
Oh him and Saro, epic battle. Must watch
This shows this show is fixed he's world famous Simon would definitely know who he was I've been following mb14 for years
See 👀 talent 👏 🙌 👌 😎 😍 ✨
rip off
Ant and Dec, good choice!
I get shocked... what a talent what a rythm... he deserve to go on top
Dub fx all can say this has been happening for years and there better out there that sing and mix the loop the affects was good but no golden buzzer and ur looking about 2008 9 dub was about street busker
MB14 YEEEEES ! T'avais déjà tout déchiré à the Voice. Là c'est juste la confirmation... Et en plus, tu parles very well english 😉 Bonne continuation!
Sensationell ❤🎉 The Winner is..... MOHAMMED
Welcome back BGT  ! What a relief !
Awesome. Surprised beat boxers haven't been on here before
He was the ex member of Berywam. And one of the sickest beatboxer and looper... Check him out guys!
The best beatboxing come from France
This guy is insanely talented!  Well deserved golden buzzer 👏🏼🎉👏🏼🎉👏🏼
😮amazing
GBB > BGT
Deserved golden buzzer for sure. Loved seeing him in the voice as well
Yeaah Thank you Ant and Dec a great voiceman!!!
Seen this done better I think elsewhere but still impressive and good to watch.
This is a world class act
So good that I had to watch it multiple times!  Excellent!
He reminds me of Gennady Tkachenko seen on Georgia's and Romanias's got talent
SBX 👍
What a masterpiece
This year is going crazy
Tom Thumb ??????
Reminds me of Sam Perry on the Australian the voice its savage to watch
Simon can’t believe what’s before him!! 😂😂😂😂 Pure talent!
We finally get a beatboxer on bgt
How did this guy not win the voice france. Because this is an amazing performance
Muito bom! 👏🏻👏🏻
No one remembers him from Berrywam?
👀 i can see that guy win   it's fascinating he's already famous according to other people here
Now that's talent!!!
If you like this, go watch Saro's Billy Jean. One of, if not The, most amazing loop tracks I've ever heard 🔁. It would absolutely bring that whole theater down
That’s what you call raw talent 🥰
MB14 🔥🔥🔥🔥
If beatboxing/looping were a sport, he'd have Olympic gold. 🥇
Him and Saro, amazing artists.
He was on the voice France in 2014. Should he really be allowed on this
Ufff
He's Really good
wow amazing ❤
Like Grey hounds out of the trap lol  excellent choice guys
Watching this on the telly was a madness
Hi bgt
He is the best act in the history of Got Talent. The winner of BGT this year
Mb14!!! Big ups to the beatboxing community!!!! 👏 👏 👏
FAVOURITE GOLDEN BUZZER BY A MILE!!!!! Ant & Dec Brilliant Choice 🔥🔥🔥
Finally a handsome talented muslim contestant wins a golden buzzer ❤😊
Amazing!!! I loved when Simon was just shook 🤣🔥
Eu já conheço o MB14 a muitos anos e tô muito feliz em saber que ele ganhou o Golden Buzzer do Ant and Dec. Eu amei ❤
0:14
If he doesn't work in the music industry he could certainly model! What a talented guy
After Saro, MB14 is the best who we are have with loop, he can do a lot more even that, he quit the BERYWAM, that famos group from AGT, to go solo carrer, he is the GOAT.
Sounds amazing!!! (and what a beautiful smile) ❤
Thus guy was good........Sam Perry won beat boxing  with Coach Kelly Rowland  at The Voice Australia 2018.
I haven't watched BGT in ages, but it's always nice to see a performer you've been following for years get the recognition they deserve
He was okay, wasn’t golden buzzed worthy at all though!
unreal talent wow, best act ive seen so far
Surely I can't be the only one who thinks this is really overrated?
AWESOOOOOMEEEE😮😮😮🎉🎉🎉! Btw, where is David W.?😢
Shooting 4ward a few weeks. The winner of BGT 2023
This was incredible! 👏👏 🌟
Cant believe a muslim can be beatboxer 🥹
Ant and Dec got to go to King's coronation!!! :D Love them!
Wow. Never heard anything like it..
Me and my mother was watching this audition and holy moly, we were both ABSOLUTELY Mind blown. Well deserved golden buzzer
MB14 has been an inspiration for many loopers in the beatbox scene, its great to see how far he's come and to where hes brought the scene. We're all proud of you brother!
Pure Talent ❤
PURE TALENT! Very well deserved
Real talent🔥💯
Well done Ant and Dec 👍😊
ASOMBROSO.  💯

He was on The Voice France 2016, that song is called Pyramids.
Great talent
That golden buzzer is so deserved!
He has incredible talent❤
Absolutely love the Middle Eastern Vibe. Incredible 😍
if only the audience could shut tf up till he finished his performance
This is epic
Thank goodness the golden buzzer was worthy, this guy is going to win
Amazing ❤
MB14 used to be in Berywam.
❤ Amazing!!!
Amazing
Brillant !
NEED to see his man boobas
Absolutely brilliant really enjoyed this 👍
What view count are you seeing this at “771”
I’ve know MB14 for years! It’s great to see him back doing beatboxing
Sorry I think this was rubbish personally . Much better acts were on that deserved the buzzer hey ho. He wasn’t making the noises they were pre recorded. He took the mic away and the noise kept coming . Utter rubbish. It’s BRITAINS got talent not France
This is on par with  stavros Flatley,  twist and pulse, diversity. Absolutely amazing
The voice was synthesised, not just his voice through the microphone
Frist
Damn deserved that didn't they I nearly cried after he finished beat boxing we ant and Dec were talking, I knew it had to be a golden buzzer😉😉
Omg that was amazing and I am watching rn on tv I bet he’s so Happy I never knew ant and dec would press the buzzer I just thought It was just the judges
Well done to him
This guy was so good
This guy is special
This was awesome
Талантливо
This guy has real talant
Its awesome ,im a frist viewer this video
This was amazing 🤩
Hi
first
Ant and Dec almost always have the best golden buzzers, this year is no different! One of the most original and best acts I’ve seen in a long time. That is true talent.
This guy is already well known. Wtf?
He’s a such a talented guy
