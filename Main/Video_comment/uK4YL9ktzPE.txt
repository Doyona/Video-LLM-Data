Salah is so selfish man. Doesn’t even try to cut the ball back to his teammates when running in the box.
Kelleher >>>> Adrian
I honestly did not know Huntelaar was still playing..
Liverpool youth just looked sluggish
Kelleher is pretty good after all.
The penitent hospital taxonomically terrify because wind distally stop till a obese thomas. dull, nasty gosling
Jesus christ how many yellow cards did Liverpool players get
The yellow request naturally wipe because layer ophthalmoscopically program over a smart dance. permissible, mammoth mercury

How can they forget Neco Williams's assist? Oh wait, English bias...
The hapless banker implicitly steer because singer neatly coil onto a dear estimate. condemned, sticky worm
The mammoth wall macroscopically reign because t-shirt cellularly peel till a scientific judo. tacit, brainy hammer
Liverpool should have scored 4. 3 one on one attempts with the keeper (1 Firmino, 2 Salah)
So why was Adrian ahead of Kelleher ? This kids a stud
Nobody:  Fifa 21: 4:06
England > Holland
wasn't in the highlights but did anyone else see that Neco trap and turn leaving the ajax winger on the ground with broken ankles?
Man of the Match-Kelleher all the way!!!
Salah hype train are over after that tackle from Sergio Romas.
Kelleher stood tall. Really tall. The last header save was absolutely world class.
Kane or Firmino?
1:15 "I get the feeling it's not gonna be nil nil for long"  First goal comes 52mins later.
if i ever play in the champions league, i'm going to put my hand over my heart for the champions league anthem
You''ll Never Walk Alone. #2092
I remember Gerrard being interviewed when he was managing the under 23 in Liverpool and he mentioned Jones as one to look after lol
Don’t know why no one is talking about Schuurs. He had a brilliant game and mane went no where. He had some shaky play but he did very well today
Jesus Christ is coming soon, repent from your sins and live a life for the Lord starting today because tomorrow is not promised. Jesus will come and take his people and after he does, God's wrath will pour on the rest of the earth for 7 years.
1:16 he said it was going to be a high scoring game.      Turns out it wasn’t
That goal by kutis Jones was superb ❤️❤️❤️👑🙌
Coverage of UCL is crap in the US, forced to watch in other languages because of the stupid ass Golazo show
Need more of firmino in the team or  mane and salah won’t pass each other Jota not doing any better!!
Kelleher had a fantastic game.
ajax totally nailed it. it deserved to get some points home and away. both times liverpool got goals by ajax own mistakes. says alot that the keeper of liverpool was the best player for liverpool out there. ajax is only 10% of the networth of liverpool. sallah is already more worth than the entire ajax team combined.and still getting outplayed like this. looks like the level of england isnt as high as people think in the first place. its just the money that make it seem like it that way. bet ajax can win the PL if they were in england. it pretty weird when u see how little money they have compared to other big clubs.its just amazing. when ajax have the same amount of money and power as the big clubs, they going to win the champions l over and over again. cy m8s
Both Keepers were amazing
Stop rating kelleher off of one performance, Adrian had one good performance last season too after Becker was benched due to injury.
Alison who
takeaway 3 words from this match - MY GOD KELLEHER!!!
Well Adrian can start packing his bags. Kelleher is definitely no. 2 behind Alisson now. What a performance
Kelleher > Adrian
Kelleher should be Liverpools backup keeper not Adrian
If we loose that next game against atalanta, I say ajax are one of the favorites to win the uel
Curtis Jones is mad good
So why was Adrian ahead of Kelleher ? This kids a stud
Ajax played pretty strong. They have good team.  Would have been draw If not goallies mistake
6:47 the linesman ran on to the pitch
lucky bastards
Was expecting something better from Ajax...
CBS coverage is trash
Ajax always so much joy to watch
What happened to salah
How did firmino not score that ? Lol
Onana, Kelleher, Curtis, Salah, firmino... outstanding
There’s a dude name aryan being a little bitch. You know who I’m talking about; and Aryan why do you try to downplay someone’s performance he’s young and needs time to develop. If you get joy of pulling people down then fuck off.
6:07 can we appreciate how mane kept his ground and played with respect and unlike Neymar didn’t dive. Mane fought for the ball and deserves to be notices
What a run and goal by Jones.
Liverpool should bring Jones more his performance was so good
Who else agrees that Curtis Jones can become one of Liverpool’s best youngest players ?
Love to see kelleher get more game time. Great game he played
Now there’s a good reason to get rid of trash Adrian
Line ups FFS!
Saleh sucks
Give credit to the keeper of Liverpool  Haven't seen him play before but he held a shutout  Great game by jones too
#17 liverpool player Curtis Jackson I think better then a Firming
You get a booking, you get a booking, EVERYONE GETS A BOOKING!!
That Mazraoui guy is good! Hope to see him move to a better league soon.   On a side note, I'm just here wondering who would name their baby Caoimhin?
What a match for keleher
Liverpool goalie saved them but lewandowski would of scored that header, Liverpool defense still has alot of weakness, good job goalie
Ajax deserved a draw at least
Neco assisting to Jones! The young Lads!!!!
liverpool isnt gonna make it past round of 16 😂
Jones is impressive
Jones is impressive
Daley Blind is deadweight, mans just stands there and doesn't challenge the ball, he can't keep up when they run, and just gets in the way when they defend aganist counters. Shame really. Should look more into figuring out how to help his teammates than just getting breezed right by.
Love Manè ❤️
Liverpool getting points with homegrown players
Where’s overated Promes
Kelleher should bench Adrian, if he’s going up against an A class Ajax, he can go up against anyone in the premier league.
The game should’ve had more goals. It was thrilling to watch.
Noone plays beautiful football like Ajax. Love that club! I wish my club was as brave and talented. Love to see them in the finals. Com"on Ajax! Bravo!!
Bruh why Neres always lookin stoned af
on god curtis Jones the most slept on youngster
Lol i need to use VPN just to see this cuz it's not available yet for my country..wtf XD
Onana what's my name, Onana whats my name, whats my name
how did mane not get a red for the elbow?
May have lost but man Ryan gavenberch was an absolute beast
To be honest as a temporary replacement for Allison Becker that keeper did good today
Ajax were surprisingly open, slick players but none of the menace or organization of Atalanta/the Danish team.
LFC wins—Klopp runs off to return to his swamp home
Very proud of the young lads today. I am not a huge fan of Neco and his erratic crosses, but he did really well with that cross for the goal that Curtis followed to score (Please don't tell me that it was by design). Curtis, Neco, & Kelleher all did very well. Now it is time to get back to the EPL circus. That is all what it has become with the PGMOL and EPL VAR idiocy
Doesn't score... "he couldn't have hit it any better".... weeeeelllllllll
Praises for Kelleher! Adrian...................out (mic drop)!
Thanks cbs
Please just put a mic on Jordan Henderson. Such a captain 3:12
The press really did damage to ajax
Broo salah  should have taken the shot
Liverpool just has to take advantage of the chances . great young players tho
3:20 reminded me of the Chelsea game when they both got booked lmao
Curtis Jones for Liverpool is equivalent to Phil Foden for Man City
Ajax played like they shouldnt win
Curtis Jones seems legit
Fun Fact: Curtis Jones is the first Liverpool player with the letters S-C-O-U-S-E-R in his name to score a Champion's League goal for the club.
No one deserved a goal more than Curtis Jones he’s been playing amazing every game and today he had chances to score glad he did
Salah is not good at all . He only wants to score . He could do better by helping other people to score too.
5:58 Gini was a bit lucky to get a yellow there. Tough tackle.
academy boys linking it up
Onana /: that isn’t like him to make those mistakes
0:52 salah would be the one to still shoot
The real 2019 final
Unfortunately the referee blew two major calls in the second half that would of resulted in two red cards for Liverpool. Ajax should of been playing 11 on 9 at the end of the game. The referee failed to give two clear red cards to Liverpool players one which resulted in an Ajax player being punched in the face. The other a clear foot on foot spiking on an Ajax player. Ajax has an excellent team and they were robbed by the official in the game who failed to give two red cards to Liverpool one card an obvious punch right to the face. Ajax should of easily won the game and with Liverpool looking like they are in big trouble with their coach having problems managing a team loaded with talent.
Neco Williams showed real grit today, and what a ball with his weaker foot. Take a bow
outstanding play from Kelleher
Kelleher > Adrian. Love them both but I have more confidence with Kelleher between the sticks!
wow Klaas Jan is still on the pitch. loved every bit of that goal by the lads.
Two take aways 1. Don't want to see Salah starting anymore 2. Kelleher was amazing
Liverpool should have had like 5 goals minimum. Finishing wasn't there
5.00 Salah wtf?
Klopp pulled a hamstring at the final whistle 😅 Let’s hope we can bring home the 7th 🏆
disappointed in jota passing vision i cant even begin to count how many times mane and salah was though and he held the ball 😡😡 but gg liverpool
I think that liver pool might not win there title like they did last year
Where was this liverpool keeper all this time? Simply outstanding.
I love Ajax they have a pure football team no gimmicks...they had a lot of opportunities.
4:14 WEEEHOOO
Amazing! Hopefully our injuries won't out us down. I want to see us vs Bayern!
First game of Neco Williams: this boy has no clue This game : what a beast
Seems the team plays so much better with Jones in the lineup. Should be a regular starter
klopp has been talking about how great Liverpool's academy prospects are for a few years now. Looks like he was correct despite the doubts. Kelleher, Williams, and Jones all look like they have excellent careers ahead of them.
disappointed by Ajax too many mistakes
Linesman @6:44 😂
Editing in these is kind of disappointing. Love the highlights but they're nowhere near as smooth and enjoyable to watch as the NBCSN Premier League highlights.
While Onana caused Ajax the game he also saved them on many occasions why hasn't a team in the top 5 picked him up is beyond me. Chelsea could use him. I feel that he is better than Leno at Arsenal. Even Bayern as Neuer is getting older and I feel it would help him tremendously if he sat behind Neuer for a year and really polished himself under one of the all time greats.
Good on Kelleher, played fantastic.  #YNWA
That new keeper played well. Should already be ahead of Adrian.
Kelleher, Jones and Williams all played very mature today. I was pretty nervous for Kelleher but today should bring him more confidence than any of us could’ve predicted. Liverpool continuing to show they are a great TEAM. Shoutout to David Neres too.. had me on the edge of me seat twice until his injury.
What a pass and what a finish :O
Whoooooa!!! Brilliant! That's the best Liverpool have looked all season!
This should’ve been the final 2 years ago
what in the fuck is the linesman doing at 6:45
Job well done guys big up to Kelleher wat a feture
Liverpool manager players our getting injured but he doesn’t rest his 2 main mean and brings on CB for Salah lmao 😂
glad to see liverpool with a better keeper
6:46 why’s the linesman gone and run in the pitch😂
Just remember,  count the Liverpool goals that are either handed to them by really stupid mistakes by the other team or cheap penalties and then take into account the chances teams miss vs them which if they would have easily taken would make them look average (like ajax in both away and home games with a  tagliafico lucky deflection and now an onana mistake.)
Ajax deserved more...feel like I've been saying this after every loss for the past three years.
If Adrian played it would of ended 0-5 losing lol
All I’m saying is if we had Adrian it would of been 1-1 or us losing
Alvarez played great defense. Ajax should play him at cb
Liverpool are going to be great for a long time, Klopp has a whole B team of young guys that can play
Who remember the Everton game Allan goal against Adrian and in this game huntelaar vs Kelleher then you can decide who should be the #2
Good performance by Kelleher, let's just hope he doesn't pull a Karius.
Onana saved Ajax. Shame they couldn't produce

SaLaH iS sO sElFiSh
WHERE HAVE THE NECO HATER GONE THEN????
I like this young goalkeeper! Keep it up bro
Glad we got that 3 pts!!!!
Anyone else think Onana is pretty good? I usually rip on goalkeepers so I'm starting to balance it out. He made that one error of judging the flight of the ball - I think he couldn't get a hand to it once he moved that far forward - but he seems like a good shotstopper, he keeps composure one on one, and generally seems like he's thinking more than panicking.
Ajax deserved more in this game and in the first game but this is how football works
Salahhas lost quite some pace I must say ....
When was the last time Liverpool had a spare game to play🤷‍♂️ Maybe team C or D can play, or if nice enough let random fans like us play the game 6😂😂
I’m happy Adrian wasn’t in goal 🥅
Firmino is a top striker in the world until he gets in front of the goal
For those who keep saying that we always complain about the VARs, just one question for all of you. How come we don't have any VAR problem in any UCL matches?
Multiple Liverpool players proving that if you're good enough then you're old enough. Klopp really does give them their chances.
Ajax deserved more
PLEAES NO SPOILERS IN COMENTS!!!
6:46 lol
Yes   Yes this is Anfield  Yes this is Liverpool  Better believe it guys 🖖🤞👏🤝👍💪
Liverpool's clones played well today.
Neco assisting to Jones! The young Lads!!!!
Curtis Jones is so good🤩
Love Mané and Salah. Might even name my kids after one of them. But dear lord when they’re wasteful with their chances they’re the most frustrating players in the world.
What kind of upload speed is this
Nobody is giving Neco Williams credit, the boy played so much better than his previous two games
Follow my instagram #nationalteammexico  And on youtube #jovenesfutbolístasmx
All of our players our injured and we still taking everyone down 💪💪💪💪💪
Kelleher is pretty good after all.
Curtis Jones is becoming one of Liverpool’s best all round midfielder, he plays with so much confidence all the time
Was expecting something better from Ajax...
Klopps babies?
Idc if Henderson is the worse midfielder in the world,he’s very crucial to the Liverpool team,cuz when he not there they play different
Great game for Liverpool. ❤🎄
earlier than the white dads at home depot
Donny van de beek
Yall so fast
ade tovar trashtalk incoming
Kelleher played his ass off, great game from Jones and Williams. Future is bright
What a save by onana
When I saw kelleher on the lineup: oh no But when he did fantastic : wow!!! Kelleher amazing today
He was awesome tonight. He should be ahead of adrian! Keep improving Kelleher you seem like a gem!
Remember his name Kelleher what a young goal keeper
