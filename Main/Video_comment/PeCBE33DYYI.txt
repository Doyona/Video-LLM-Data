Ksi is a boxer, not scared of people bigger than him, but the bugs getting him good :'D
gosh it would be a dream to have a  friend group like theirs
Keep up all the great content :)
the montage at the end and them all singing holiday is so nice. I love that clip sm. I'm so glad others absolutely love it too because its such a homely feeling.
Cried ;-;
Fantastic vid 😂
ending - elite
Does anyone knows the song on which JJ is dancing on the yacht.❤❤

God I pray to have a friendship like the sidemen.
What song is playing at 17:59
I feel like if sidemen end the song they need to end it with is this one or just a wrap up of everything with Holliday playing
18:10 KSI getting sturdy
“We’ll see what happens gonna next
The end hit different 😊
They should make a sidemen intro with that montage soo good
this last clip was touching
aka harry as harry for 36 mins
Such great vibes
KSi getting afraid of bugs every time  are my favourite scenes
❤❤
https://youtu.be/PeCBE33DYYI?t=1090 whats the song name?
youtube raping with ads
33:46 obsessed
good video.
What video is 6:20?
BANGER
The amount of times Ksi said he was going to die in this whole video is insane lol 😂
I pray that I will live a life like they do
This video would not exist without ksi and harry
What is the first part
ksi screaming “i’m gonna die” is one of my favorite things to listen to
*my fav video on youtube*
Legends claiming KSI is still dying
Imagine being worth MILLIONS of dollars, just to be thrown into a dumpster 😂😂😂
I miss Phil :P
W
Ending epic................♥️♥️♥️♥️
Omg 6:16 I was crying tears of laughter, trying to be quiet to not wake hubby next to me 🤣🤣🤣
That clip bruv…  U guys made my hole year
The best group to ever exist
21:46 Harryyyy :'D
Love the ending fellas
KSI screams remind me of Homer
Legend has it that Vikkstar swam through both the Indian Ocean and Red Sea, swam through the Suez Canal and then the Mediterranean, through the Straight of Gibraltar, and then on to the coasts of Cornwall.
34:48 no way I’m crying bruh
I'm late but, this video in a nutshell is about: 45% Harry 25% JJ 20% Rest of Sidemen 10% Other "Celebrities/Guest"
I hope they never stop posting.
At 6:16 which vid was that from
How much of this just Harry 😂😂
Going to be a sad day when these guys finally move on from YouTube
I’m not ready for when people start leaving sidemen or they stop the channel😪
5:53 I swear I'd rather die
The ending is peak
Who is the old guy in the video
They are having fun but little did they know that they r making memories ❤️
man this made me wish i had friends
6:11 man's genuinely traumatised
What was the song called that jj and Toni were jumping on the boat too I need it it’s a vibe !!!
The fact that I found them when I was just in middle school and now I’m college. I’ve seen them grow so much and I’m happy for them
“What happen gonna next” Words of wisdom by ksi
Wild
the sidemen in my opinion are the best group on youtube and i dont think there will be another great group like the sidemen
21:53 what video is this???
JJ screaming is the funniest thing in the WORLD!
why was the ending so emotional. they all were singing with ksi and cheering him on and then it transitioned into a montage of all of them having the time of their lives. they seems to have so much love for each other
the best
17:50 😭😭😭
11:25 😂😂
They should add video titles as well for those who are new to the channel.
Never used to like The sidemen but they’ve grown on me
Tobi, JJ, Josh, Simon, Harry and vikk  they was so lucky to have each other.
that end bit of holiday was something else
The "Im gonna die moments" 🤣🤣
Indian speedboat
The sidemen and Mrbeast are truly carrying YouTube on their backs right now
I still feel soooo bad for that little girl when Josh saved her shot lol
24:10 FKN HARRY😭😭
Notice they’re all wit Harry in them
I want a friendship like theirs
the ending of this video should be used as like a goodbye to the sidemen whenever they choose to retire
These moments are basically all harry spilling things or having bad luck lmfaoo
Favorite clip is 27:00
The sidemen ARE SICK! best youtube group
Am i the only one who doesnt enjoy those Tinder and Dating vids? Its plain Boring und cringe AF
best youtube group of all time

33:45 Legendary Sidemen clip and edit
When Harry and Ethan out jj in the bin I cried 😂
I love how they all gas each other up when they do something sick especially when vik did the double spin
When tobi hops in to dance with jj on the boat while listening to jjs song, absolute heat
Feels like 2022 been a long year so far but then I return to this video and realise 2021 ended 5 months ago
25:50 bro Susan Boyle’s trippin

33:44 best moment of 2021 sidemen
Y'know, I still want to see them bring back the mermaid girl for a video
Harry is just unrivaled. A national treasure

I love how JJ when he gets scared has no filter at all, screaming the n word lmao, what a legend
so funny video #crazyyyyballs
@26:07 my man ethan was the first one to understand the pun here but doesn't know "what do the cows drink ?" 🤣🤣
I have been sidemen strong since 2012. I need to meet them at least one time in my life. literally grew up with them is what it felt like. I'm 20 yrs old now and still watch at least 10 vids of them a day. whether it is new or 5 years old.
intro song?
bro there was an rx7 😮
This made me tear up, the end felt like a flashback of a broken up band.
33:59
Ngl the day that the sidemen stop posting will be so depressing
aw the sidemen carry youtube ibr
Vikkstar can really swiiiiiiiiim
i love this video these are the best
ending made me cry
Bro.. the end of the video, with holiday... just made me feel like I'm there with them...
This guys are my favourite peoples on this planet 😭🥺
I wish I had as much fun as them. ;)
Sometime I hate that I don’t understand their accent cuz I can’t understand some jokes
I'm not going to lie jj being a boxer fighting alot not like a school fight or a batch fight and then seeing a bug or being scared is actually kind of amusing people like loganberry Paul not a problem a little bug he could just punch or squash he's in trouble I mean everyone has or probably has something but its still interesting to watch then jj struggling then someone in the background I'm going to piss myself 😂 thats great
8:15 that n*gga hits different HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
18:24
The ending made me feel like sidemen retired had me in tears 😭
JJ: I’m gonna fight Logan and Joe Weller Also JJ: *sees wasp,bug and on obstacle course* AHHH AH AHHH IM GONNA DIE IM GONNA DIE IM DYING IM DEAD
Damn, it's gonna so painful when they stop making videos in the future.
Song 16:42 ?

The sidemen genuinely make me happy
I wished I could hair the tune to JJ's 'Imma die'
I'll be enjoying this for a long while~
growing up watching them just made this video extra emotional damn
Ksi is terrified of bugs 😂😂
The ending is giving me chills every time I watch it
29:38 i can’t stop laughing bro😭😭😭

27:05 is probably my favorite
Low key KSI is a wimp when it comes to bugs.

I laughed the whole video until the end. I cried so hard 🤠
What video is 8:19 ?
Last Part Hits Differents <3 Goosebumps 100%
The day the sidemen are no more, I'll think back to these times and shed a tear
18:20  when JJ hit the camera I stopped breathing I just couldn't. We need to talk about Harry kissing Simon's forehead in the montage
Our fatneek ❤
Can’t believe they’ve been here for years .

Let's see what happens next ❤
i cant be the only one who got the chills when the Holiday started, right?
The montage at the end made me tear up a little ngl
30 mins of memory’s 🥰
The Sidemen should make merch of JJ sarcasticly running away from bugs and insect's
JJ: be more brave

18:05 love the vibes between jj and tobi there
Wish I had a friend group like this
God I love this channel
cant wait for them to see whos the strongest sideman this year, and the moo off is not to be forgotten
That ending was absolutely beautiful.
So wholesome 😇😇
this was beautiful
The ending was beautiful w8th the montage if they had done it with all their best clips drop 2012 from there so boys would have cried
The ending actually gave me chills, because that is exactly what would play in a documentary after the Sidemen finish🥲  The Holiday part was also pretty emotional
30:10

34:10 I love when they sing Holiday =p That is a moment every boy can relate too

sidemen made my 2021 better tbh
The karaoke clip at the end was sooo wholesome
I luv y'all 2 much
Having a friendgroup like this must be every persons dream.

26:10 just ruined the whole video just proves how women judge things something they cant even see but apparently your structure and height tells them.
When harry kissed simon on head and with holiday playing it just fking teared me up so bad…😭😭😭
The bois are such a vibe. Living their life to the fullest
Which episode was that treetop climbing video? With JJ 'dying' trying to get across?
Notice how harry was the only one not singing holiday. He really doesn’t like/listen to JJ’s music lmao
Harry is just too funny bro 😂😂😂😂
Where can I find 8:20 video?

Harry makes such jokes on camera just imagine the madness he creates off camera
the ending karaoke hits different now that I've fallen in love w these guys
Too nice, The little montage at the end was bangin!
that ending tho 😊
JJ's holiday outro got me feeling nostalgic 🥺
JJ: "I've died, I've died" *proceeds to continue walking and screaming*
Man I love y’all
Sidemen literally carried 2021! 2022 will be a great year for the boys!!!
I think this pandemic has taught people the importance of multiple streams of income, unfortunately having a job doesn't mean security rather having different investments is the real deal
The best group of lads on youtube never fail to make my day plenty of laughs every time i would love to live the life these legends have  👊👊
Such a great video. Laughed so hard at these clips and might watch it again. Thanks for all the laughs last year!
I’m everywhere 😮‍💨
Not a shocker that 90% of these involve Harry Lol

Harry pretty much carried this video 😂

24:14 best part lol
What video is it that last part is from where JJ and the bois is singing holiday?
Gib  is too funny
Whoever edited and put together that end montage with Holiday playing deserves a raise, that was immaculate and made the video so much better
I love how gib has been in only one sidemen Sunday video and he made it in here multiple times lmao
Harry carries
21:45 can anyone explain what harry was saying. Cant quite catch what he said
British Youtube is ELITE - cant beat it !!!!!!!!!!!

The beginning of the end ❤️ Made my absolute teenage years a blast these lads and still making me laugh now. Cheers legends ❤️
24:55 is the best moment in sidemen history😭😭😭😂😂😂
21:37 xD
I love when Harry sets the fire and Ethan panics and yells out to Freezy.  And Freezy enters casually and is like "Oh." Baring in mind he and Harry have lived together for ages, this is probably something Freezy is accustomed to.
That Taliban bit 😂😂😂
what did he say at 22:12
good ending lads
Plzz give us a 3 hr montage
Sidemen Litterally carried 2021! Anyone else cry from 34:20 till the end or just me?😩
ONE OF THE BEST SIDEMEN VIDEOS EVERRRRRRRRRR!!!!!
This shows how many ABSOLUTE BANGERS the sidemen have put out in 2021. Incredible 🔥🔥😭
Who thinks 2022, sidemen should build there own office, just like dp
basically a montage of harry being an idiot
18:03 what song in the background?

It's not easy to make content. There's got to be a lot of pressure to make it after so many subscribers.
8:30, omg this killed me XD
Can we just give props to Dylan their editor cause he has been working his arse off making these videos the best they can and at the end he has just proved how good he is at the end of that video and for the while video aswell and also the John ,kon and th rest of the crew and obviously josh,Harry,Simon,jj,Tobi,vikk,behz, for everything they have done for us
"Clapped" is the biggest moment hands down! lmao

If this was their last video... I'd be ok with that.
😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️
27:00 is one of the best moments this year
34:31 is the best part.it made me cry
I like how they sometimes make jokes about disorders and all, but man they really got to be careful on how they say it to their mates bc it may offend viewers that are watching this sick video bc they may have one of them themselves or maybe someone close they know has it 🤷‍♂️.
35:07 such wholesome moment i actually cried
2021 eh 👊

I was expecting when randolph got finnessed in hijingo (the number 58)
That was the best ending for a video that I have ever seen. All the sidemen showing love to each other and singing ksi’s song made me smile. Sidemen made 2021 fun and made the tough times funny💯

Started watching sidemen during 2nd lockdown in India. Haven't been hooked to any YouTube account this much in a while. 🤣🤣 Have been watching all the older videos and have watched all the videos of this year as they came out. Wish them the best of luck for 2022 as well. ❤️🔥
I didn’t watch this at first cause I thought it was gonna be a mid video. I was wrong that ending…Damn
The ending literally gave me chills 😭
8:01 i can legit hear the autotune over it
https://youtu.be/OL9F1xS20Fs
It’s a wrap!!
The ending is my everything
When they all helped jj with holiday, thats true brotherhood right there
JJ, a beard product ad came on during the video. Clear indicator. It's a sign
Fly me away away your my holiday🥳
The edits and transitions during the video are quite frankly amazing and compliment all the boys best bits. Looking forward to seeing what the boys get up to in 2022

12:40 Simons face of pure disappointment is sending me 🤣
They used the Stranger Things kinda intro..

29:09 - harry moment <3

Should be titled “the greatest w2s moments 2021”
Bog “The games the game” molly mae would approve

Beautiful outro
Elite squad! 🤟

Sideman have been absolute levels in 2021 lives every second of it can’t wait for 2022
If u didn't tear ur not a real fan
Sidemen be carrying every year, but I don't think people realise these videos are just as fun for them to watch as us. I'm sure in 10 years they will watch all these best moment videos to recap the awesome memories they made
almost droped a tear at the end  such a great family
I freaking love these guys
That ending was like a beginning of the end of the sidemen  but I hope there’s still a long time left
The transitions are awesome
The end almost made me cry😭
This is the best group of friends on youtube there videos and there friendship makes me want to do this wit sum of my friends

I love the sidemen bro
Wow the ending made me cry so much 😭😭
1.20 fcking get sencord and c..... not hahahhaa
the ending brooooo
harry is the funniest yute on the planet .
They made my year :')
Robot wars might be the best video of 2021
Who else can only hear the song when JJ has his freak out about the bug in the car
Harry baited is tho ngl
The only thing that stopped me from hating 2021 Was the sidemen
The way jj is scared of bugs but not scared of boxing someone
Anesongib should be in more Sidemen Sundays (Sidemen vids in general).
Bro,I can't believe I actually cried 😢
These guys are carrying youtube
Animal cruelty :( that poor shark
Legends<3 sidemen > YouTube
Sidemen create a connect ❤️
Wtf is this no sidemen Sunday 😡
I guess we'll see what happens gunna next in 2022
The ending made cry i'm going to be so lost when the sidemen decide to stop making videos
This is by far the best sidemen video
JJ needs to go into I'm a celebrity get me out of here with his reactions to bugs&honestly everything😭😭🤣🤣
W
holiday montage made me tear up a bit
weeks passed by because the only thing i looked forward to was sidemen sundays
That Harry pinero line will always have me crying 😂

This is the type of friendship i always wanted. Whatever type of situation, whether it’s good or bad, always stick up together❤️
I love u guys and the clip of the holiday was so inspirational and I love how u guys have so much fun together
Had to double check to make sure, but I watched every video the Sidemen channel released last year. If that doesn’t speak numbers on how incredible this channel is, I don’t what will.  Also, really good editing throughout the whole video, very impressive.
why do i feel like the end was like a goodbye stopp
How dare the rich laugh at the poor! 1:22
What is the title of the first vid did not watch seems interesting
Elite editing
Bro the sidemen change my life
Silent library was the best video of 2021 no cap !!

I can't get the autotune version of JJ's freakout out of my head
Beautifullll
Goosebumps at the end
to the people annoyed that it was a compilation and the people who didnt even click this video and wont see this comment, these guys were giving us non stop bangers throughout 2021 and 2020 and this video reminds us of all this epic vids thx SDMN
this video is how the sidemen should end the Sidemen channel but put all the best clips of every year into 1 video
ayy BIG thanks to the Sidemen for this incredible year, vikk pool race was mad
Me: Hey dad how was your day?  Dad: 18:18
4:52
Next year maybe turn this into an ad for Side+? Compilation of some Side+ content to showcase what it is and give people a taster. It'll be new content as well for a lot of people so hopefully it gets a better reception.
Thanks for the Amazing year, in bad conditions ya‘ll still made amazing videos and the how the quality improved. Big Thumbs up!

Sidemen made 2021 so much better! Never realized it until I watched this video
these guys are not friends, they are family
The sidemen are sick
A compilation that’s 30 minutes. Stinker of a video
Do sidemen river fishing
Thankyou sdmn for these years im glad my for my entertainment
I feel like At the end of 2022 they should have an award ceremony like locked in did at the end of the season
Goosebumps at the end
Who else can still hear the bug remix

2021 wasn't so bad afterall

33:48-35:27  The end felt like it’s the last video ever with the montage and it was playing holiday  I bet most people were emotional by that part
Now that I’ve finally stopped crying of laughter 😂😂 These man killed it this year 👏🏾 Honourable shout-out to Harry Ballon d’Or level stuff 😂😂👏🏾
16:57
Let's see what happens gonna next
I can’t believe this didn’t include the clip of the wheel when JJ was so certain it was Adele. That was a goated moment of the sidemen this year
Bro 2021 was such a great year for the sidemen, so happy to see the guys come from making FIFA vids to the massive things they are on now, havIng released sides and XIX vodka, can’t wait to see what’s in store for 2022
21:47 😂😂

That holiday montage at the end is ELITE!!!!! ❤️
Outro was like a movie💜😩😩😩
POV: your KSI I am gonna die I am gonnaaa dieee ahhh a buggg ahhhh
what video was ksi hitting the drone un
11:12 gib  and Ethan are too funny 😂 19:13 one of my fav moments
Just the best team that ever existed
This was worldclass
The outro should be the holiday music video wallah
Harry carried this funny moments
toer
i cant imagine them all growing up and having their separate family’s and being completely distant from youtube
Favourite video ever
When I watched the montage at the end It felt like they where ending the sidemen! The vibes I got! Great video! Kept us entertained over the pandemic
I love u guys
Please make som more haunting/scary videos
Damn that ending with holiday over the top gave me mad goosebumps 😭🥺
i loveeee this
shame
awesome vid boys
damn this video took an entire year to make
Holiday really made it for the entire damn year. Even the little Wayne song got old at one point.
Where’s the sideman Sunday
What was the song @12:56?
its literally all harry. he's such an icon
understandably so as to why this video doesn't have great views, it wasn't what i was expecting for a sidemen video, i feel this should if been put on the moresidemen channel.
this video was so much better than i thought it was gonna be
The editors out done themselves
SM22
the title should have been called: KSI best moments of 2021
I rate all the transitions, they were so smooth
So they put it out now
I got told off cos I was laughing too loudly, thanks sidemen, been watching this channel from the beginning, legendary people, the whole team (like editors and camera crew included) thanks for the incredible journey, hope it gets better and better :)
Last 2 minutes got me vibin haaaaard <3 boys
8:01 man is so skilled that he makes tunes out of nowhere
I cried laughing simon standing reaction to tobi throw.
Props to Kon along with the bois man He's done amazing work Especially the last bit was crazy!!
5:43 I could feel his pain through the screen!
Literally had chills when holiday started playing!!
Where is Theo getting humped?
2021 YouTube was carried by The Sidemen. End of speech!
Omggg love yaa😩❤️‍🔥😭
it’s sad that sooner or later they are not going to be making videos
the end gave me sooooo much goosebumps
https://youtu.be/-TLnUi8C1QM hi
33:46. Wow I got goosebumps bruh 😂. What a fantastic year related to sidemen content. Cant wait to see what 2022 brings us.
so pissed that at minute 35:10 the didnt add when harry and vik ate the same apple together...
I started watching them since the pandemic started  and they have made my every single day, they brought us smile in these tough days.  Love u guys✌✌✌✌  what I like the most is they don't act, they be themselves,,,,,, cheers
Who is the old man at 10:00 ?
Who was cutting onions towards the end! I demand an Answer! 😭
the only reason i actually clicked on this video was because i saw vik with his swimming goggles on
What video is the clip of the bus singing on?
Man what I’d do to have friendships like these guys. Always having each other’s backs, never leaving anyone behind and living life to the fullest together
I’d also love to nickname part of this video, “Harry bruising his nonexistent ego”
ksi got autotune on his screams
🥲
5:43 I thought this was a carboard cut-out lmao
That “Holiday” song at the end really caught me off guard and I cried a little ngl 😌🥲
24:57
The ends soooo heartwarming bruv
gang
I love how this all revolved around JJ
anyone else notice its all harry hes the best sideman
https://youtube.com/shorts/ud-R_m1JOaU?feature=share
can someone name the song  at 18:09?
I see what they did there ( 5:39 ) with the laugh transition.
Best!!!
I expected this on more Sidemen.
Probebly the first 30 mins video in my life that i watched without skipping and to the very end.... Except for movies of course!
That ending was elite
YouTube ain’t YouTube no more once this group stop making video
I like the JJ is a puzzy segment
Wholesome
Next year do the same thing but have the sidemen watch it and make it a drinking game.
I accidently watched 1 real tinder video and now am big fan of sideman i watched every video of them and looking forword for 2022 cheerss boyss!!!
a great year boys love the sidemen <3
Emotional
Not a dull moment
I don't feel good about this,
thanks for making the year bearable the ending was class
I waited all week for this 😡😡😡😡😡
ayo who was cutting onions at the last bit of the video smh. fr tho, the way harry kissed simons head like that at the end was so freaking wholsome
Sorry lux but the Luke Emia clip is definitely my favorite
🔥
Does anyone understand what Harry says at 22:11? The thing everyone dies at
damm that ending with holidays gave me Goosebumps
only real sidemen fans will watch this video
The last cut fam.. My heart's melting🥺❤️
I just couldn't watch the whole ending part,  i know it will just make me sad cause i dont have such good friends group
The outro 🤌
21:38 best moment by far
I loved the ending more than anything
man these guys have me heaart !!!
the ending with holiday caught me off guard....actually cried haha
JJ doesn't 'Get Hyper' anymore, he gets 'Down Like That' 18:04
Tommy T absolutely hilarious :D
Holiday might be one of KSI's best songs ever
Don’t worry JJ I’m scream the same way everyday “IMMA DIE”
Awesome vid!
I literally fell of my chair this was so fun
Did anybody rewatch this because of how goated they have been last year?
Is these for real I wait all week for these no these is a joke
goated group of guys
Thanks to the crew behind the scenes (camera, techs, editors etc., sorry if I left anyone out) for this, if not for them, this would not exist.
Freezy is the most icky cringy UK youtuber. Idk why, ever since I first saw him he just gets on my last nerve...
This is the guy who beat Logan Paul lol
i reckon the reason why they didnt make a sidemen sunday this week is because they got something big next week
34:29 wish I can tattoo this
Thanks
The last part was just wholesome
I literally could not stop smiling and laughing throughout the whole video the sidemen are such a great group of friends and just made 2021 so much better.
Great year, gents. Here is to 2022.
Sidemen 4 Life ! all the Best in 2022 !
About to cry cause these lads made my year better

Heart warming....i love u sidemen

STOP, HOLIDAY MAKES ME TEAR UP AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA CRYING SCREAMING THROWING UPASKDNFB K
this has got me sentimental ngl  especially the holiday part
The ending was the best thing I've seen in a while these guys bring so much joy to so many people big up the sidemen!
Can we appreciate the transitions to some of these moments
33:45 onwards hit me in the feels man. So proud of these guys.
When Phil was chasing its wax like me when my brother beats me at fifa
Absolutely loved Gib in the camping video 😂
Jj one was the funniest
What a family they're they are brother for life am so thankful i support the sidemen
I have a feeling that 2024/2025 will probably their last year to upload as sidemen, and I don't think I'm ready for it.
WHAT A TEAM!!!

Sidemen with no context 😂
MAN THE SIDEMEN IS LEGENDARY 😩🔥🔥🔥
Imagine if Gib knocked down the id in SIDEMEN
Tommy T is underrated lol

Summary of the year: JJ did not in fact die
The fact that they posted a montage on their main channel means they were just tired.

The beginning of the end :,(
Literally bout to cry , these guys dont know how much better they make our days , how much time we spent with them (watching their videos) , my wish for 2022 is for them to keep going and never slow down

I’m happy to watch but I’m kind of disappointed this is a more sidemen not something we wait for a week to watch. love u guys but come on.
Petition for sidemen suiiiiii of
I love these idiots so much
17:55 this JJ moment is proper mosh pit energy i wanna be there for this lmao

8:32 is which video??
Really a sidemen Sunday where it’s a compilation, this should be a 2nd channel video, what a joke. Easy week for Harry, Ethan and Tobi as they don’t upload to their own channels anyway 😂
I would love to see a Hells Kitchen video. Get Gordon Ramsay and Phil to run the pass while the sidemen cook. That would just be amazing to watch!!!
the last part was amazing!
Thanks
11:30 which video?
Elite.Just Elite.
I thought I’d be mad this isn’t a real video but I loved this
2021 was a terrible year but the sidemen literally made it so much better! Y’all really put a smile on our faces
All the love and support ❤️❤️
Sidemen is the best family bro✌
Sidemen best

The ending kinda made me tear up a little. Been watching the sidemen since 2012 when I was playing fifa in 3rd grade and just needing their energy to give me laughs.  I’m now in college and it’s incredible to see how far they have come. They’ve changed my life and I can’t thank them enough for being who they are. Sidemen for life ✊

11:17 was the best of Gib. He was the star
I got divorced this 2021. I felt suicidal for some time and the sidemen for the most part helped me get through this year. Hoping I can have an amazing 2022.
I don't get the callux middle name joke meant
Goat
The outro tho 😌
8:03 automatically plays the song in my head
8:02 I love this part I like how it turned into a beat in the Reddit.
Love the sidemen. They made me laugh countless times and I just love each and everyone of them. Can’t wait to see what’s next in 2022. Love yous😘🤣
It's crazy that I only discovered and started watching Sidemen a few months ago, it feels like meeting an old friend somehow. I can't wait for what they're bringing this year!

Man, that montage at the end just got me emotional. Thanks for making me laugh and lifting my spirit since 2014.
The Sidemen and Offline TV kinda carried the latter half 2021 for me. Coming back after years to see what these guys were up to was not a mistake.
Harry carried this video
why didnt they just call it 36 minutes of harry being harry
Truly am grateful for Sidemen x
Big up to the sidemen literally made that quarantine days goes by like that

19:17 that transition tho
Ksi being a little girl around bugs and touching that shark is so gunny

Boring
18:09 song?
The Last part was crazy 🤪  Nostalgia of all the year
Ending was amazing holiday song transitions
Best channel ever
We all want a friend that can make us laugh like Harry can Ethan.
The sidemen will live on as the greatest group YouTube channel.
This should be on more sidemen
Ahh let's gooo
I have to go rewatch The Wheel now, forgot how much Stephen killed that
Ethan’s laughs, JJ’s screams, Harry’s pick up lines, Vik’s Indian Speedboat, Josh’s ruining the spirit of a 4 year old, Simon’s hosting, and Tobi’s epic goalie abilities made my 2021 so cheers lads to a great 2022.
Harry has been a real comedy riot by himself.
Well done mates ❤️
i really thought it was gonna be a good video
Whats happen gonna next
Thanks for making 2021 great
New title of the video “KSI laughs for 36 minutes” 🤣

9:20 was by far the best moment of the year.
That montage at the end made me emotional.

GGWP lads

So we waited a week for this
They really are the best 🤍
U know we could complain about how this ain’t rlly a sidemen Sunday and we got bamboozled but we got bangers all year long during covid if I may add, thanks guys pls never stop

JUST TWO WORDS: THE BEST.
Literally I was in middle school when I started watching all of the sidemen and now im about to finish college. Absolute legends really hope that I will get to meet some of them one day and just have a talk with them!
The ending was elite ❤️
i Cried at the end thanks for making 2021 really amazing

The best part is JJ sees the bug and Says am gonna die 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

ENDING WAS ELITE❤
The clip at the end of them all singing KSI’s holiday always gives me goosebumps. Shows how far they’ve come
The End though!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Sidemen is my Holiday :)
Can someone count how many times Ksi has said “I’m going to die, and I’m dying”!!!
I was waiting for a video and i got this,but ok
KSI: fights Jake Paul and wins. also KSI: gets knocked down by a drone 😂😂😂
perfect compilation
I love how Ksi is a literal boxer and is scared of bugs 😭😭
The kings of this whole platform. Sundays can’t get any better. TO THE KINGS 👑.
bro these transitions be sick af tho
Holiday gives great vibe and enjoyed watching sidemen in 2021. Hoping for the best in 2022!
The transition at 19:17 was insane 🥶
2021 is the best year for the Sidemen. Continue the great work in 2022 lads!
No way this is what we get for a sidemen Sunday video
Regular video: 1 hour 15 plus  Year recap: 36 minutes
Big up sideman honestly there to goated no one compeats
Harry had us with the tweet 😭😭
Can we get KSI to post another Holiday music video but just clips of the sidemen the whole song
When the sidemen were younger, in the football videos when one of them would do something sick they will all go crazy, , now its just different
Really made me cry.... Wish i could have had good friends like them.
We knew it was coming
My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined
6:17 epic dub step
Majority of this is Harry and jj 😂
That sidemen vs 5th graders video doesn’t seem like this year either
This is wholesome I can’t lie
Absolutely sick montage!!
Oh man its so wholesome at the end 🥺❤️
5:29 crazy transition, great vid 👍🏻 I love the sidemen 😂
The SEVEN biggest Influences in the uk!!
As soon as  holiday song came on and the montage started had me tearing.

5:43 Ethan looks like Zerkaa!!!
the starfish would have been better
"I'm gonna die" ksi 2021
The ending was the best thing ever!!!!
Crazy to think they started as 7 lads playing GTA.
Ngl they cheered us up through covid and whatnot. Thanks to the Sidemen
The combination of Harry and Ethan is unbeatable 😂😂
Them singing holiday is a top 10 sidemen moment
I waited 1 week for this and this is what I got
This video is jokes well done lads, happy new year 😂😂😂😂😂
Just wow 🥲
petition to make these videos more sidemen videos so we can get actual main channel videos on here?
Lack of…effort a fucken compilation
👌👌💯 vid. A harry compilation
Amazing video 😂❤️
The end was so wholesome 🥺
The editors wow me every single video props to the editors they make the video look so professionally done they need more props
Sidemen are elite.
15:10
If jj and harry wasn't in the sidemen no one would watch them
From only liking harry and jj to loving everyone equally we all grew up😂
this is proof that money can buy uou happiness as well as being around the right people
Today is my birthday
i wish i could live my life like this
The Sidemen need a back rub after carrying 2021 single handedly
I’m not capping when I say I watched every video this year, can’t wait to see what 2022 brings for them
I swear if these boys split up 🥺✋
I actually teamed up when it got to the montage
Sidemen dominated 2021.
The best video on YouTube ever? Probably
oh yes the yearly compilation
13:14 best scene ever
30mins of me not being depress.
the sidemen just make me so happy glad i can say i lived in the same time as the sidemen
Whole video was ksi saying "Im gonna die"😂
awe the end was so cute
The ending of this video literally couldn't of been better. Thanks Sidemen! ,❤️
harry's micheal jackson impression being transitioned is so smooth
yoooooo , i almost forgot: Behz: Beckham? (tinder) Josh: YA-YA (tommy-T)
:}
bog and ethan are an unmatched duo
the ending was so good
absolutely CARRIED 2021 my goats
The ending just bloomed my mood, transition of karaoke into the song and the moments of the SIDEMEN 💕❤️
❤️❤️❤️❤️
I cried at the Last 3 minutes

From all the usa fans thank y’all 🙌🏼 can’t wait to see what’s gonna go off in 2022
How has the sidemen never been cancelled
That ending 😭😭😂
LOVEEE BOYS KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK
Sidemen killed it mann
Best ending ever to a video on YouTube thanks for a great year sidemen
can some1 tell me what the 13:30 video is please?
Unpopular opinion, Simon has the best and most contagious laugh 😂
Ive been watching the sidemen since 2014(their individual channels), they helped me a lot, I used to live in England and I barely knew English and they somehow taught me how to speak it. They are like my family♥️
All the effort put into a vid pays off when it drops. These guys are honestly sick. Making money by just having fun W ur mates has to be one of the best jobs I’ve heard of. See u lot in 2022
This is mainly best Harry moments
This literally had me in tears 😂😂
The "Fockin hell" before JJ fell into the garbage bin was absolutely hilarious!
This is beautiful. Just wish I got great friends like y'all are. Please, do live long qns live happily, Boiis.
Bro the transitions in this video are so elite... I don't think people understand.
Harry shaking his smoothie with no lid literally killed me  I’m crying laughing
The outro was lit
They are honestly living it’s unreal what a small group of people can achieve
Comments: "a day off" 😶😶😶😶 Me: Ay yo allow it fam
Thank u guys !!!
No shut up the ending made me cry
Sidemen:trying make everybody cry Me & KSI:allow it fam
WHY 35 Minutes When THis Has Really Been Madness last Year Of The SideMens

Love this friendgroup
8:30
who else teared up in a good way hhahah
What vid is 8:22
bro 1:47 😭
Big CARRYYY
The ending was so wholesome 🥺
KSI freaking out about the bug in the car is the best memory by far. It was so unexpected and funny!
The ending was the best part
Very happy 😊
Gib has more funny moments than tobi
"We waited a whole week for this, common sidemen" Joke aside, This was so good man. All the perfect moments, and the last bit where all of them sings Holiday was so good. The side+ is fantastic to watch. Thabks for being there and making our life more enjoyable via these videos.
❤️❤️❤️❤️
JJ's scream and Ethan's laugh are just peak comedy to me.
Bro why tf am I crying 😢
Harry is one of a kind, what a guy
Wow, the outro with Holiday in the background gave me the chills! I've been watching the Sidemen for nearly a decade now, and wow it's been a crazy ride! Every year the content gets better!
When all the sidemen were singing JJ's song at the end that made me cry, i love your work guys keep it up <3
Notice how most of these are of harry
Can we talk about the edits and production of this thoooo. Big thanks to the sidemen and their team ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥🔥
19:18 that edit was cold 🥶
Was this meant to be a second channel video or?
9:03 name of video?
I am so greatful for these boys it truly feels like family, they've brought happiness and laughter to so many people around the world watching them grow and growing with them has been crazy, they have such a big impact on youtube  got me thinking how sad it'll be when they stop making videos.
KSI is basically dying the whole time
The game is the game
Wish I had friends like this
22:12 to this day I still don’t know what he said 😭
Why did i cry at the end
Callums laugh screams virginity
the last bit got me in tears not gonna lie boys
"I'm gonna dieeeee.i'm dead"-jj (2021)
They really live the life we all want
We may not know each other but this community knows what The Sidemen have done for us❤️
why was theos date not on here
Love the bond they have makes me so happy when they smile 🥰😭❤️
Thanks for an amazing year boys
Underrated video, killed it👏👏
transitions are too sick
like half of them include harry 😂
5:42 That could have worked in squid games tbh.😂
WHERE IS THE BIG FAT QUIZ OF 2021 ?!?
20:38
Yo I wasn’t prepared for the end. I BAWLED.
7:22 did no one see the RX7 👀
The last part is enough to make a grown man cry 😭 Hopefully 2022 will be more bangers to come 🙌🖤
And now I want to cry
Nice job
Anyone else cry during the outro
They are the best!!! Harry and JJ are just two living memes !!
sidemen carried my 2021, not ready for the day it’s gone .
The end was cute ☹️
The transitional edits in this are sick 🔥
0:36 that transition tho 👀
Shoutout to sidemen for making a compilation but actually a good one even though I’ve watched every video this year, it was entertaining to watch this again
Can someone tell me what Harry P said to that one girl @ 22:10?
5:22 this transition is soooo clean
20:18 They were talking about Covid
What video is 1:35
sidemen carried 2021
belle video
Made my 2021 so much better. Sidemen are Elite and i love every second of it
All of this is 2021?! Iconic!
Kai every few clips imma die imma die imma die
Literally goosebumps at the end felt like a joint family
I've been watching these guys since 2014 and its so amazing how far they have all come they have all had a mad glow up and have changed all of our lives lots of love lads and everyone behind the scenes too
wow
The end is actually emotional
Thanks for brightening my day
Elite editing!!🔥
hm
The ending is too sick 🔥
May i ask what video is the one with jj screaming on the climbing frame
Best video, best group on YouTube by far
Can I just say the Sidemens content has been LEVELS above previous years. They literally made some of the most god tier videos this year, especially recently. E.g. Hot vs Cold holiday         20 vs 1 sidemen: KSI edition         Abandoned challenge         $500 car challenge         Sidemen $10,000 vs $100 camping (with Gib)          All the hide and seeks           Etc...
Montage cringe but still pumped
What a year. One of the best years thanks to these guys. Thanks for everything sidemen.
what a video
These lads really know how to put a smile on my face. Been doing it for years. Just class
Came liked, watched 30 seconds to support and left Happy NY!
It bring tears in our eyes
so what's happen gonna next????
I still don’t know what Harry P said at 22:10 could anyone enlighten me?
did anyone else hear the remix version @ 8:00
wrong channel.. this is a more sidemen video...
19:17 That edit was sick
The best of SDMN :D
Mad how all of this was only from the second half of 2021
i cant be the only one that cried at the end of the vid
PLS SOMEONE TELL ME WHERE THE CLIP FROM 11:30 IS 😂😂😂
man did they bring so much laughter to this year
Great year ❤️
Harry literally spilled the wine on purpose. Tell me I’m wrong lol. Look at the smirk on his face before he does it 😂
My Day Is Ruined And My Disappointment Is Immeasurable..
The ending was great
A bunch of dude killing life, so awesome what an achievement
Respect to these guys for making our Sunday’s exciting each and every week of the year ❤️

36:30 minutes of me smiling
What is the song 17:55?
why did they have to do me like that in the end 😭
Been watching these boys for 8 years. That ending made the weekend. Love these lads🙌🏻
21:59 was the best moment in all the Sidemen videos in 2021 and it’s not even from any of the Sidemen 🤣
26:58 killed me. Best video of the year
damn these transitions are fresh asf
I’m gonna die counter
Sidemen have literally  been the most consistent best content creators on this YouTube! It’s mad seeing these videos compared to what we used to watch at the start of this Journey!!! XiX
That cut from JJ Screaming to the haircut was top Tier
Love these boys
24:59 the best joke of 2021
the ending is amazing
What a year 👌🏻
I wrote weekly notes to myself about the highlights of my week and put them in a jar to reread them when 2022 would start & I have mentioned the Sidemen several times because their videos really kept me going when I was going through a rough time. All love, happy 2022 to everyone ❤️
Ending made me emotional,  am I the only one? Lol
Tinder needs to get a blocked section 😂

Biggg video ❤️

Harrys an absolute icon
Harry is in almost every moment
Don’t ever stop making content. I’ll be here until YouTube ends. ✊
That ending got me all emotional, the day that they stop being the sidemen will be a very sad one indeed 😢
❤️
LET THE DISLIKES COMMENCE
We need a compilation of everytime JJ said he was dying 😂
SIDEMEN BECOME MERMAIDS STILL NEEDS TO HAPPEN

I honestly don't know what I'd do without these boys
Now that people think closely about last year it was kinda lit
Accurate title: KSI saying he's going to die for 36 minutes plus other sidemen moments
Sidemen in 2021 was so elite, I honestly can’t wait to see what 2022 has in store for them.
Happy New year Sidemen
Ngl, this made my entire day <3
22:06 someone pls translate what he is saying i geniunely can never tell what words he is saying here that everyone freaks out over.
Last bit with with jj‘s song was amazing and literally touched everyones heart ❤️❤️
The ending when they sang holiday really got me, all of the memories of them. I don’t know if it’s the fact that they made my childhood and realizing that won’t be making videos for much longer or what, but the ending really touched me
Y’all have actually smashed it this year
the chills that i got watching the end omg
Ksi most iconic line  IM GONNA DIE IM GONNA DIE
8:20 I love how he goes *im gonna die, Im dying, I’ve died*
Hhhhhh the jj last what is the next  is the best of 2022 😂😂🔥

The gang tickle is terrifying
The Sidemen are just 7 best friends living their best lives and creating memories together
I definitely love being a part of the Sidemen and their journey. Big ups to them and all their endeavours as well eg: side+, sides, Prime, Viks engagement etc. Y'all definitely carried 2021 and I'm looking forward to 2022 ❤️🙌
We all knew this was coming 😂
Ok nice Comp but where is sidemen Sunday
the ending was amazing i was smiling so big 😭❤️❤️
This has made my night honestly
one of the funniest vids yet
Its like having a group of friend i never had...im friendless =(
Some people may complain about a complication for a sidemen Sunday day but then I think a lot of us appreciate the great content they already make
There should be a compilation of Harry funniest jokes
That ending was elite
The ending montage made me feel some way, these guys are amazing
Amazing more among us on more sidemen plz!
I was I the only one who had the song played in the head when jj said oh my God ah ah there is a bug bruv
those transitions are sick bro, well done. thanks for the 2021 memories!
We just need a ksi I’m gonna die compilation

U lot make my days have a banging 2022
I'll lose all hope if they ever stop making videos
15:11 vik is savage
The last song just summed up how u feel about the sidemen
8:03  I just hear the remix every time
The outro was elite
Born in Italy, from Tunisian parents, proudly watching the Sidemen😍😍😍😍i usually never leave a comment on videos but remembering all these moments from 2021 has made me the happiest human being on earth, 2022 will be amazing Insh'Allah❤️Big love, peace out for everything, i will always be a Sidemen😍
Sidemen shorts: The movie
This low-key fodder
8:15, whenever I hear it, I think of the music
Going to be a sad day when they start splitting up
Not me crying at them singing holiday. I love them sm.
21.48 has me in tears every single time!
harry's comedy is unmatched that man is so funny
Bro so wholesome bro this made me Renner how manny times they’ve made me smile. These dudes are the reason of our happiness
A montage?
Big uppp for the sidemen 💙
They are the best well done boys
That transition from helicopter to Harry dancing was hard!
Compilation ffs disliked
Can we get a worst of the Sidemen 2021 video lol
The best team
This sidemen Sunday is gonna be lit
ending was elite big up the sidemen, the editors and the whole crew who makes this possible
I can’t under the song when JJ goes “Oh…My…GAAAWDDD” 8:09
Sidemen Sunday is a constant reminder that i have work tomorrow

HIJINGO was the best video
6:18 i want to know the EXACT combination of food that was needed to produce a fart like this 😂😂
Sidemen literally cure my depression
The ending made me cry aaaah I love them so much
❤
Sick vid👌🏻
🤙🤟🤘👌✌👍🔥
much love from PH! Love y'all <33
He died in a house fire ffs lmao
We’re hoping for the double the amount of fun content this year, all love ❤️
Petition to make Phil the 8th sideman?
The last bit literally made me cry so grateful
I wish i had a friend group like this:(
Bro are we just gonna ignore the FIRE transitions thru this montage
I think a cool idea for next time would be to have this edit made and then show it to the guys at a cool venue on a big screen and make that the video. having their input as they react with us would be really cool. ngl i thought thats what this video was as its on the main chanel. great year nun the less
the end got me crying
ever wondered if celebs vibe off their own musical creations? 17:52
The end almost made me cry lol. Glad i got to witness and watch possibly the BEST GROUP of youtubers out there!! CAnt wait to see what more to come. Keep it up boys<3
🐐🐐🐐🐐
Thanks Guy’s ❤️
This is one of Harry’s best lines 💀 21:40
Literally every clip: harry
Name a better group/chanel on YT, I'll wait.
Thanks for great year boys 2022 even better❤️
That was elite
W year!
Gib is so underrated
The Sidemen will never be matched
I hope JJ never dies, just because of how annoying he would be in the moments prior to it
34:24
8:02 I can't unhear the remix anymore
My year would have been a lot darker without these boys. Keep it up sidemen, much love
Really enjoyed this montage they really had a great time
Gib making it into the montage makes me happy. He had me dying 😂😂😂
KSI wrote holiday for the boys 💯
Sideman videos cure depression imo
hi
The sidemen have had such a good year vid wise I’m not mad at a montage bc I wanna watch one
5:42 Ethan would actually be a really convincing Joker
Who is emia
I have no words 😢 😕 😔
Who’s cutting onions
Second channel video? Accidental upload?
When they gonna upload this weekend new sidemen Sunday content then? Should be on morechodemen this 🙄
Epic
Best bunch of lads ❤️
20:10 only Harry can pull this off😭😂
it feels so weird hearing jj screaming about the bug without auto tune
fk is this i hate compilations
Not gonna lie, when Josh saves the penalty from the 4 year old. That was hilarious 😂
what a madness!!!!
bro the sidemen re the best
I’m really looking forward to what happen gonna next!
can someone tell me the name of the video at 8:19
Int Tobi's voice "compilaation"
The clip of holiday and the boys montage makes this entire video so much better than it already was. I love the sidemen so much and I’m so happy to see what they bring to 2022
Bro the end , the holiday part, made it look like the sidemen are retiring 🥲
Can we get like sidemen spend ten k on Steve and 100 dollars on kon

Guilty of smilling the whole video✋
Outro was heat
Harry is just the og
Them Singing Holiday at the end was Dope!! Much love from ph boys
I like that they included Hijiingo in this, cuz that was definitely one of the best videos they released this year even tho it wasn't on this channel
I almost cried at the end where the music was
half of the clips jj: IMA DIE
Never laughed this much
Love these guys, all the best for 2022❤️
The end of this video was so wholesome
The ending really had me crying 😭 the sidemen are hands down the best group on YouTube
The last part of the video with holiday playing is how I hope the Sidemen do their last video showing all their best times giving us the memories to remember forever with heartfelt music to give a huge send off to the Sidemen (hopefully not for a long time )
Y’all got me tearing up and shi aw
Sidemen just makes everyone's year better.
The ending was so wholesome 🥺
That ending hit different 🥺
Not gonna lie, this compilation banged!
34:20 wholesome wholesome wholesome
Not this making me cry

Holiday at the end got me in the feels 😭
MAN, THE LAST PART JUST MADE ME CRY. SUCH A GREAT GROUP
Ngl Last part with holiday playing, kinda emotional u know
the ends got me crying
I genuinely don’t know what I would have done without these guys. I’ve followed them since I was in middle school, and I’m turning 25 this year. I truly hope I get to have a drink with them one day
Why does the end sound like a Good Bye.. 🥺🥺🥺🥺😢😢😢😢
At 8:00 True Ksi fans hear this scene differently
My favourite group of guys
Can’t listen to 8:05 without hearing that banger of a song😂
Kon really the funniest sidemen
Dammmm what a cop out 💀
The outro was 🔥🔥
Sidemen are elite keep it going boys
The absolute best on YouTube!
We are blessed to grow up with these people.
The best year ever even when covid was around

That Vik pH scale line was just something else
Best YouTubers on the platform and it’s not even close. Landslides better than anyone else. Thanks for a great year of videos.
We'll see what happens gonna next in 2022
🔥🔥🔥🔥
And here I was thinking we wouldn’t get a montage lmfao
I like how most of it was just Harry being Harry
34:32  35:06 - No cuz that bit at the end with the clips that had holiday playing over them made me tear up 🥺 would be lost without the Sidemen <3
I still am struggling to understand what he said at  22:14.
ending really giving us all goosebumps aye?
Best ending ever♥️♥️♥️
We waited for a week for this omg
Been here since these boys were just playing GTA V every night, screaming their lungs out and living their life. Thanks for all the entertainment over the year lads. Y’all have come so far and grown so much. Honestly, hand on heart, much love and keep going <33
the transitions 🤌😘
Looking forward to another year of greatness. Love u guys 😍
the ending maid me emotional, love u guys!

The goats of YouTube, no 🧢. Thanks for always putting a smile on my face!
Seeing jj in the car yelling to the bug feels weird now when it’s not edited into a sick song
Ermmmm where is my video haha? Cop out
Goosebumps at the end man
Legends
I give this… 5 VIKSTARS
In punishment pool, it sounded like Harry was laughing harder then Ethan even though Ethan was the one getting tickled
Brooo the little montage at the end is so wholesome
ending made me tear up
What a banging year
IM LITERALLY CRYING
why do u always do this montages
Cop out
Every sidemen Sunday video is like a movie every Sunday
This video genuinely cheered me up. What a year it’s been for the Sidemen. I’m glad I’m a Day 1 Side+ T-shirt owner. On the annual package by the way👀 I’ll be renewing next year, too. Hijingo is an absolute classic, by the way.
Kept everyone smiling in a tuff year 👑👑
I love the montage!!
i really needed this video thankyou for a year of good sundays!
Yo, I love the part at the end with the them singing the song holiday, that whole part gave me chills just looking at their friendship and how wholesome it was.

I know it didn’t bang but do it wars was elite
jj is too funny 😭

I loved this best bits look back but was surprised it was only 36mins when it could have been way longer.
What. A. Year.
I've watched every sidemen sunday this year :DDD
Calfreezy is just the cartitan irl
The fact that Harry was in more 50% of all the clips says what (btw Simon had 0 moments)
Basically a flex on how rich they are 😂
Bro why do i feel like these are my best friends and we all had these adventures together
This feels like more sidemen content
I’m glad they put the tinder with Harry Philly n chunkz that one was funnnyyyy 2022 gotta see a video with them again
If SidemenShorts Was a Video
Damn the ending got me in tears 😭
Why is there bleeping of curses in the beginning?
I live for the transitions
Sidemen are goated

Good montage could of been longer but I take the appreciation of them giving themselves a break every year
Didn’t have to snake me cry at the end

Sidemen gotta be the sickest family on the planet 💕

im not the biggest fan of compilations but this one…. this is the one
best video icl
😐
Was expecting the first video of 2022 to be a banger not this crap
Absolute banger of a year for sure, didn’t miss a single Sidemen Sunday posted all year!
They absolutely carried 2021 can't believe some of us has been here since day 1 to all of them and it's amazing to see them grow
The end was so wholesome
I didn’t know serotonin had a video form
22:11 what did harry say
Thanks for a good year lads and congrats on 10 mill, best channel out there 💯
All the best boys keep doing great. LOVE IT !!!
Its weird that i started watching the sidemen when i was 9, i turn 16 in a week. Crazy.
I love
It's nice to see how they've developed over the years And how much their content has improved  Keep it going boys
KSI is the toughest scared guy I know
I don’t know why some people don’t like the  Compilations I honestly love them
If I'm honest sidemen carried me through 2020 to 2022 and always will
9:50 Ralf Ragnick
25:02 can someone tell me the joke😂 i dont get it
Sidmen carried 2021 fr
My Sunday night is always brightened up by these videos man thanks and keep it up guys ur doing amazing
What a year it’s been!
Best montage in the world
19:19 was a sick transition
No one on YouTube can compare. Thanks Boys❤️
I’ve been subscribed since 2014 and the sidemen is the best channel on the platform 🎉HAPPY NEW YEAR
JJ has a real fear of bugs 😂😂😂
Big up the sidemen
“Waited a whole week for this”
34:04 - 35:27 Is already my favourite clip of 2022

Phil
🐐s of YouTube carried 2021 on there shoulders
These lot are unbelievable such an inspiration these are living their best lives while making people laugh ❤️
Just shows how goated Harry is he was literally main part of 90% of all best moments
Wholesome☺️
Amazing transition on the outro . Much love to the best YT group
19:17 that transition tho
The part where Ethan realizes Luke + Emia was probably the funniest moment all year
11:20 best clip of 2021
Ok we'll see what happens gonna next!  Bring on 2022!
It's sad to think that one day, these lads will all go in their own directions and have families.
They didn’t really drop a comp on a Sunday yh they’re going to hear it from the fans 😂
❤
I think Ethan and Harry are going to be best friends for life
What video is 8:25
The very ending with JJ
Surprised at the lack of comments slating a montage for a sidemen Sunday, but the boys do deserve atleast 1 week off a year, so glad to see it.
The last 2 years for everybody have been such challenging times - these boys have made so many people smile and stay mentally healthy! They deserve absolutely everything
Notice how pretty much all of the clips are either harry or jj 😂
I could not breath through this video i was laughing so hard
19:16 clean transition
Mad year for the boys
This there final year?

KSI: I’m gonna die
I’m not.  Crying
The sidemen fr carried 2021. Helped me through the good times and the bad, but uploads as regular as these wouldn’t be easy to do, so props to them all for being the best group on YouTube, and I wish them all the best of health.
I love the sidemen so much
literally living my dream life. hanging out with all their mates, travelling the world and having fun making youtube videos and making a living off of it. i’ll make it one day

I really liked Ethans picks for this video
We see what’s happens gonna next in 2022
ending was emotional
Straight up cried at the end lol
13:33 AHAHAHAA
I don’t think a compilation video should get all up in your feels right? ❤️ Holiday playing over the final clips was elite.   Massive admiration for these guys, the last year would have been even worse if we didn’t have their content to allow us to escape the horrors the last 2 years have brought.   I won an actual Sidemen competition this year and was so chuffed, these guys have helped me through a lot.    Sidemen 💙
Why was the ending acc make me wanna cry😭😭😭😭😭
My fav boys <3
Poor
Alternative title : Best Harry moments 2021
I feel scammed of a sidemen Sunday here. I’ve already seen all this moments fairly recently
that clip of them singing holiday makes me so emotional man
4:46 😂
They’re content is so good……back then
This video made me realise JJ is actually a wuss
I cried…
11:31 LMAOOO HARRY DOESNT DISCRIMINATE. He could be a bad btch too 😌✨
Ngl the song at the end was emotional, keep it up !!
The karaoke of Holiday was the most wholesome moment of the year. Most people can only dream of such a good group of friends.
This video made me laugh so much 😂😂😂
Literally just a vid of Harry’s funny moments 😂😂
Bruh low-key emotional at the end
The best friend group of all time
2021 was the worst year of my life, but the sidemen helped out loads.
What video was this 8:20
Been watching for 7 years now, by far the funniest group on YouTube. The end where KSI's holiday song comes in really touched me. 2022 will be even better! Let's go boys!
Hi
big ups sidemen, saving this year for us lot, wishing an even better 2022!
This is sick
6:14  "that was Dubstep bro" 😂😂😂😂🤣 can't stop re-watching it
The clip with HP will forever be marked😭
Goats of youtube
What’s the title of the video where Ksi thinks he’s gonna die from heights please
Watching this is getting me worried that sidemen won’t post again 😔😔
Can’t believe I’m laughing at these guys at the toilet bro
Wow, I cried at the end. What an amazing friendship 💖 here is to 2022 boys!
When did Harry kiss Simon? 😂

Everytime i see the footage of jj afraid of the bug i hear the melodie comin in 😂
Amazing transitions!

Yea, Sidemen are god tier in the YouTube scene 100%
JJ and the bug in the car is one of my fav moments along with the whole Hijingo videos 😂
Crazy year for the Sidemen here’s to future years topping 2021
Fully love the sidemen
Been so long since weve seen a montage
This is enough to make a man cry
8:19 The progression from "Imma die" to "I'm dying" to "I've died" to (Incoherent screaming) got me dead💀
This should’ve went on the second channel
The amount of times jj said he was gonna die I’m this vid 😂😂
7 figure gibber was the highlight
I dont think i could have lived through 2021 without the sidemen
What a life they’re had
best of harold 2021
The day they announce stepping away from YouTube is the day I stop watching YouTube
That transition at 19:17 was so good.
Which video was ksi dancing on the boat
Filler week, don’t mind tbh
Almost cried at the end there I mean these guys have made my last 5-6 years amazing
Such a lush montage of 2021 - loved the Holiday ending! Here's to 2022 🍻
The edits were cold on this video
I cried at the ending and then jj happens lol
The sidemen r the 🐐 of all time
elite content... these lot deserve to be millionaires
My best company all through these tough times, lots of love and respect from Greece lads!
Great video although it’s a compilation. But it’s made me realise I’ve literally wasted a year of my life. And the sad thing is, there’s a big chance my best years in my life won’t complete with the boys.
Btw where the actually sidemen Sunday cause this is not it
Who agrees that the sidemen have the best life
I cried at the end omg😭😭
a compilation noooo😭
Sidemen in one word the best❤️😍
With love from Afghanistan 😅
And all the camera men
We waited all year for a 30 minute video?
just realised how much jj says that he's gonna die..... HAHA
Was smiling the entire time <3, Vik doing them double flips in the pool won 2021 xD
What a video 💥, brings back all the memories
These lads make me smile again and again
I thought there was going to be a sidemen Sunday 🙁😞😡
1 Million views in 4 hours! How tf!!!!
bit of a copout vid but sure...
Joke ting 😂😂😂
Hands down the best group on YT. Always love the content. GG boys. Let's make this year legendary
Aw I forgot it was Sunday so I guess it was meant to be a compilation was sad but I won’t be after watching it.
Love these guys so much , big ups Sidemen 🥂❤️
I waited all week for a compilation 🤨
Scammed
the end is so wholesome its making me cry happy tears :)
banger
Ye know what’s sad no one is gonna watch this video because it’s a compilation but I think they should because it’s great
I got chills from the ending
Harry just being the funniest man alive
Made my year better and better every week much love 💙
The last 2 minutes though😍❤️
A true brotherhood
man... the end had me cryin and shii. watching them for 8 years and for longer and to see them do so well is unbelievable
Man they're Growing up 😔😔❤❤
what’s the video with gib in?
Sidemen was the only positive thing in 2021 that should have been positive
love your vids :)
Time to carry 2022
when they all sang holiday and it transitioned it gave me chills
Can we all just appreciate how sick the transitions are
please Gib in more of these he's mad funny
Which video is the first clip  from?
Filler content
side plus seems good but i aint paying for that lol
The ending made me get side+
HP on Sidemen Tinder was ELLLIIIITE
i was hoping for an actual video
Side react to the video
Sidemen is incomplete without compilations lol 😂
seeing sidemen videos really makes me greatful for being in the uk
These boys have changed my life, they seem like so much fun. I wish I just could meet them one day. Love from Norway ❤️🇳🇴
<3
What a crazy journey! 🔥
That end nearly got me crying
90% are Harry
Ayy yo the edits were clean
It’s actually mad how a group of friends could have this much love to each other
This is literally a harry special 😭😭
Ngl this felt like a sdmn plus video and not a sdmn sunday
KSI "I'm gonna die compilation"
What vid is 8:31 from
Thankyou too 😂
W friend group😘
90% of these are harry- all that proves is he is the funniest sidemen
Bro I'm gonna cry if they brake up one day
What video is the one where jj was svreaming I'm gonna die on that rope course
that ending man 🥺
Big gibber needs to be in more videos he's comical 💯
legends.
24:24 is the best line i have ever heard 😂😂
36 mins😭
I loved that ending and yh lets see what happens gonna next
I don’t know what I would do without these guys
This year the sidemen brought me and my sister together after fighting for years. And in turn helped me with my depression. All I can say is thanks guys. Keep doing what u do
Ending to this video was absolutely elite. Montage with holiday being played over the top made my day. Love this group of guys always bringing smiles even in the worst days, cheers to 2022!
this is literally the funniest group on YouTube.
them being able to make me happy throughout the toughest year of my life really shows just how amazing they are
seeing the sidemen carry 2021 was so heartwarming... Hope for lots more in 2022!
Love these guys
oh man I'm gonna miss these guys whenever they decide to stop uploading
KSI acting hard for the media.  Vs in real life there is a bug "aaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrhhggggggggggghhhhhhhhh". Goes screaming like a wimp 🤣
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Behz had the best bits
My eyes 😢
50% of this was harry being him self
Chills in the holiday edit wow
This was so well put together. Thanks for a banging year of content!
I waited 24 hrs for a main sidemen video and I a compilation 😭😩
post a real vid
Absolutely Goated Year for the boys!
19:13 Harry’s vocals though
🔥🔥
Best ending to a year ever
I waited a week for this. It should be a more sidemen video
the amount of seretonin this video gave me is ridiculous.
Fuckin Legends❤️🔥🔥
w edit
The goats of youtube
when these guy separate or die bro imma lose it
AYO BIG UP SIDEMEN MAKIBG 2021 GREAT btw Amy Blunden best mermaid
Ngl vexed about the sidemen Sunday I’ve watched everything
KSI rapping Whats Next is a better post credit clip than all Marvel movies post credit scenes put together.
The Sidemen is therapy to me
I was actually thinking about making a video like this myself showing off my favorite bits (still might) but obviously, the editors did a way better than I would ever do. 2021 was such a banger for the Sidemen (don't know if 2019 was still better or if 2021 has taken that place for their best year ever) and I can only hope 2022 is even better.
Oh so good..
Epic friendship
jjs fart at 6:15 killed me😂
We Love your dad bod Harry🤌🏽🥺🥺
This kinda made me sad
Aye Josh is actually elite, what a hero
Elite video
2021 is their best accomplishment I hope for the best for this year and another
Saved so many dark days and bad weeks, nothing but love and appreciation for the amazing content
That Holiday montage got me in tears mate
What an elite group 🐐
WE NEED A SPECIAL SIDEMEN REACT ON THIS WITH ALL THE SIDEMENS!!!!
Why was the ending abit emotional. These Boys are living the dream. Fair play to them
This should be a more sidemen video
Cop out
Best montage ever hands down
L video
that ending was so wholesome😭
What video was it at 8:34?
The ending gave me heart malputations in a good way 😊
best year so far for the sidemen
Josh’s laugh gives me nothing but pure serotonin...
I literally got goosebumps at the end ❤️
Sidemen fans when compilation on main channel be like
Best thing is all of them are highlights I remember and it makes me smile sm😊
I Can STILL Hear The REMIX 8:08
4 hours ago
Notice KSI said he was gonna die in almost every clip 😂
Holiday at the end hit me hard
Man i love yall.
:)
bro such a good vid thank god i can watch these guys brings me such happiness thanks guys
Yous have kept me smiling whenever I was down keep it up boys good luck in 2022
This video has made me realise how much the sidemen mean to us and how sad it’s going to be when they come to an end. We’ve grown up with them
the montage in the end was wholesome asf
This is just all the sidemen shorts clips isnt it
Big up sidemen!!!  Honestly Love these guys! Happy new year to everyone!
I used to watch bits and pieces back in the day but 2021 was the year I really got into Sidemen videos  Keep it up guys!!
JJ shouting( we about to sink in this MF!!!!) Literally turned me up just to dance
This is shorter than a normal video lmao
Kept me from all the worries in in my everyday life. All the  sidemen’s channels make me happy when they post. Come on Harry do a pack opening lad. Thanks for the best year, same again this year???
Another holiday idea- every 7 different videos, each sidemen has to pick out there dream holiday and they take the orders with them
What did they say at 22:10
Bruh I almost cried near the end lol
13:10 😂😂😂😂
I love the sidemen
Would love another more sidemen tier list of these vids
And another episode of me pissing myself bc of the side men
the best would be if they pranked harry with corinna
What a way to end it with holiday
Yeah smashed it
That transition  tho 🔥 19:16
Cal laughing is the creepiest thing I have ever seen
carried the year every time they upload i get hppy looking foward to 2022 lads keep it up!!

This content is for moresidemen 😔
21:27 what video is it??
wtf is this
Big One Direction vibes at the end when Holiday was played
whyd i get emotional at the end
U guys vids helps me not to end my life
KSI is 28 btw, 28 🤣
Absolute kings
I've never cried from breaking up in a relationship but if these dudes break up ima be bawlin they make my Sundays 90% better
Whenever JJ needs to fake laugh he just says ohhhhhhhh myyyyyy goddd bro 😂 🤣  instead
I never thought KSI is such a puss-   joke ofc
Not gonna lie, the last part where the ’Holiday’ song got played and when the boys were singing it made me catch goosebumps, It’s just amazing how far they’ve come
Ending minuets were elite
Sidemen always there for us
I would like to see a version of only the cold holiday maybe stuff that was left out and so on because hot holiday dubai there really wasnt anything new there so that part of that video kinda stunk
AHH NAH THERES A BUG BRUV!
1 like = 1 pushup. I'll post the video in a week
18:15
this group is unreal, will never be forgotten in this generation oh humans.
With the ending I am so convinced that the end of the Sidemen is  close
This is what we get wow 🤦‍♂️😑
sorry but an L

The first clip vik was from wow for the first time it’s not me😂
Thanks for the happiest year from Sidemen ❤️
28:29 is JJ alright? His weird laughs are some of the best moments!
Make a vid just of the end
god this makes me feel old but it’s so sweet 🥰 well done lads
Harry definetely carried the comedy this year
18:14 has me actually dying right now i cant stop replaying. jj is so jokes.
The ending was elite
so happy to see a new vid every week from the boys/crew !! can never get enough
I started of laughing my heart out and ended up crying my eyes out. I don’t think I would have found myself laughing at times when I didn’t feel okay, if it weren’t for the sidemen. I’m so grateful for the smiles they put on our faces 💙
Ending was the best bit🙌🙌👑
👍🏿

What's the video of JJ on the obstacle course screaming called?
I get the idea of having some time off but the last 3 vids have been dead, a mukbang, a ‘basically’ drinking vid and a compilation.
The ending brought a tear to my eye ❤️ been watching for 7 years and I wouldn’t have it any other way 🙏🏼
Bing bong
The bit at the end was so heartwarming, infact the entire video is such a trip down the memory lane 🥺🌸
It’s crazy that they do that for work
Oh yay another compilation of things I've already seen 👍

Always love sundays. But only because its the weekend and theres a sidemen video coming out.
One of the best things about last year was Gib  Needs to be in more videos that camping one was unbelievably funny

Don’t care if this is a compilation the Harry transition at 19:13 was worth it all
The editing on this is mad 🤯

These edits look sick from one thing to another 🔥
This  video had me wheezing bro😭😭😭😭😭
The outro was 🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶
LETS GOOOOOO A MONTAGE!!!!! said no one
A compilation of the best Moments in 2021 ? No, a compilation of KSI saying: „ IM GONNA DIE !"
Editing is class this video
85% of the clips are harry
Werner: what is this?
Can someone pls explain what happened at 22:07

What a year
Ich habe noch nie so viel gelacht in so kurzer Zeit Ich freue mich auf mehr
Yo I would love to see Tommy T Vs 20 woman I think it would be so jokes
The ending made me so emotional 😭
Someone tell me what’s he saying after 22:15 please😂😭😭😭
Every time I see the clip where JJ screams when seeing a bug in the car I always remember the autotune  version of that clip.
Legends
Easily the best & most consistent group on YT. Big up the boys 🙌🏼
we got scammed when they put a more sidemen video on the sidemen channel and now not even a 1 hour video
Ending made me tear up, absolute legends
Yo the best part was the holiday transition that really put a smile on my face
That last but was amazing
hey
The sidemen are the definition of living they're best lives! They're lives amaze me, wish mine was filled with that much adventure and craziness
That montage at the end with Holiday playing was 🔥
Last 2 minutes were try not to cry challenge
Got robbed of a video this weekend
For the most part, these fine men live an incredible life
godzilla harry should have been here.
Petition for a holiday video with Phil

Big ups for the person that made these transitions
ethan and ksi laughs carried
Ending a bit emotional

The beginning of the end.

These videos are a day if for the sidemen but so much effort for the crew🤣
Icons, legends and hero’s. So many other words that I could use to describe these group of lads. Here’s to a bright year 🤞
That ending sent shivers down me 🥺🥺
Kings of YouTube ❤️
They've mugged us here ngl!!! 🤣🤣🤣
Damn almost fckin cried at the end, love these guys
Why do jjs screams sound like that have autotune
I got full on goosebumps from this
the end was the best part
i don’t think the sidemen understand how much of an impact they have on our lives, even when we are going though a rough patch, they give us a sidemen sunday and it gives us escape from the world, it’s something to look forward to every week. i don’t know where i would be without them :)
what video is it at 1:50?
It's like a harry compilation
They missed a sidemen Sunday sad life
I can’t lie the journey that these guys went through in 2021 was amazing  I honestly teared up when the ending came honestly the most wholesome sidemen moment Ives seen
4:22
The sidemen could be the best people on earth
half of it was Harry class
all sidemen shorts brought into one big banger of a compilation
This video made me almost cry at the end that’s how happy I was for them enjoying life and having fun with there freinds
24:27
Also clearly the cars were waiting for petrol not broken down 🤦‍♂️
Eyooo that holiday outro gave me chills fam. Thanks for the year guys, let's bang it this year again !!!
SIDEMEN WILL ALWAYS  LIVE ON NO MATTER WHAT
Holiday song at the end 🥺
9:50 congrats on getting Ralf Rangnick in a sidemen video
Every sidemen fan super mad because they made compaction and its 30 minutes long only😂😂😂
The happiness we get from watching the sidemen. This year was surely special. Best of the luck for future projects and everything. And happy new year all ❤️
The ending actually gave me goosebumps
We need Tommy T to make a few more appearances 😂😂😂😂😂
Stinker I waited all week for this my mood will never recover
Vik is GOAT and u cannot change my mind bruv
This is what sidemen Sunday is when jj is busy hshs
2021 was one of the worst years personly but when i found this channel i swear it made me happy whenever i get notify or a video pop ... love this group and wish that i could have a group of frinds like this . love u guys <3.
5:24 this guy tried so hard not to laugh
I wish I had some friends to have this fun with 🙏
That ending was a banger fr
17:59 one of the best sidemen moments of the year

We need a whole sidemen video of vest sidemen moments. Funny, skills all-sorts over like 6 episodes. Brilliant video.
but disappointed but it’s still nice to look back on all of this
Waiting for sidemen Sunday vid  Sidemen sunday:
throwing jj in the bin was a hate crime
they really made our year tooo
What a waste of a Sunday :(
I just want to rewatch all of this years videos after this🤣
Why did i want to cry after this thankyou for making our year 👌👌
the singing at the end was goosebumps.
this vid might actually end up being really close to my heart cause of how fun y'all have made my past couple of years
Props to the  editor,  so many great transitions and and ending that was genuinely emotional.  Sidemen only continue to grow, 2022 is gonna be great
One day sidemen Sundays will stop.
I think with JJ having COVID they just ran out of saved videos
Is it just me, or does Ethan kinda look like a cardboard cutout laying down on the pool table
32:30
elite kings
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
The Best YouTube group ever was, ever is and ever will be ❣️
Ffs I look forward to sidemen Sunday and there just made a recap, nice
I saw Harry's tweet and got my hopes up for another Banger... Turns out its a compilation i really can't trust that man anymore
0:42 that was funny ngl 😂
the end was sooo wholesome
Goddamn thought we would get an actual video not a compilation
ngl they are the perfect group they make me smile so much , they have there own personalities!

Noone gonna talk about that transition at 19:17
He clearly jumped onto the table 🤦‍♂️ honestly how gullible are your fans. So much of that was planned.
The ending was cold
All this video proved is that KSI is a massive wetty yet he would still beat all of us up
The video just got better and better as it went on 😂

Lol JJ was busy making his own drink with Logan so they uploaded this 🤣
When sidemen do a irl tinder in america and bring hp chunkz and filly with them it'll be their most viewed vid imo
last part litteraly made me cry
There way of basically having a week off while still being consistent and putting a sidemen Sunday out😜
Literally such a good year for sidemen Sunday’s and that end bit made me tear up a bit lads congratulations on the on year and the many more successful ones ahead - love another one of the lads
Wozwrs

During the hardest times of many lives, the Sidemen have always managed to make us smile. Hope the best for them in 2022❤️👊🏾

Take a bow lads 🙌🏼

#ThankyouSidemen
Sidemen owned 2021... now on to 2022. LET'S GO!!!!
20M on 2022?!?!
Sidemen are hands down the greatest UK YouTubers. Seeing how far they have come is just insane and the friendship between them is unbreakable. Seeing the small montage near the end hit me so hard because we have all grown up watching them since their first video.
this is a sidemen sunday wtf
lwts go
What is the video at 2:08 where Harry starts a fire in the kitchen?
Does anybody know which video 8:46 was apart of
W editors
best montage video I ever saw in my life, the Sidemen literally just make people`s life much funnier and more happier like never before, really hope they keep up with the best content in the world, I`m a fan from Brazil, and I`ve been following their content since 2020, #TheSidemenAreTheBest.
17:15 the evil laugh always gets me
ⁱ ʷⁱˡˡ ᵗᵉˡˡ ᵘ ⁿᵒʷ ᵗʰᵉⁿ ˢᵒ

8:02 lmao i still hear the remix haha
Shoutout the guy that picked the clips for Ethan 👍
Wrong channel?
Bruh seriously I'm dying from laughing
Who wouldn't want to be in their gang living that life. To all those haters. Jealousy isn't a good trait to have.
Ending was clean tho well done guys
One of the coldest moments: *”I might like short people”* 💀
The ending was amazing
What a year it has been. Thanks for the constant entertainment boys. 😎 on to an ever better one.

Best transitions of 2022
What a cop out of a sidemen Sunday

🐐
Big up the sidemen! I’m 27 and still find the lads genuinely hilarious to where I almost piss myself 👏 love the friendship they have and good vibes, bless 👏 💙
5:44 Lowkey thought that was a cardboard cut out LMAO
We all knew this was coming
Just truly godlike
Harry kissing Simon on forehead is the best thing ever 35:05
The ending hits different tho 🥲
19:13 w2s ft fazlija IDEMOOOO
1:41 OHHH BLOCKED BY JAMES

been injured almost an entire year... one of a few things that made me happy was watching the sidemen.
Love the Sidemen, and excited to see what 2022 will bring to the channel. 🔥
Harry and vikk changed a lot.
The day these guys upload there last video I will cry what a year
One of the best compilation big up to the entire team ❤️
I know the boys need time off but a compilation hurts my soul.
34:30 I got mad goosebumps at that transition, I didn't cry u did
THE LAST SCENE 💀💀😂😂😂😂😂
Smiled all the way through, absolute legends man🙌🏼❤️
goosebumps at the end i'm crying
I don't  know why people hate these... This was a banger compilation .. Big Up The Sidemen <3
One of the best sidemen vid
Ffs man ending made me teary as Hell
I HATE HARRY SO MUCH
Absolutely elite! Can't wait for what this year brings 🙌
So disappointing…
I love the sidemen but “Best Year Yet” = “🤑LOTS OF MONEY 🤑” *insert evil ksi laugh here*
People who watched the side+ episode and knew this was coming 😩
"we'll see what's happens gonna next"
0:20 second which video is it from
Legends!!
actual killed it. cant wait to see what the new year brings
the outtro was everything❤ thank u sidemen for making my sundays better, in general just my year. Can't wait for 2022
I WAITED ALL WEEK FOR THIS!!!      Joking…
Most elite friend group of all time
I can’t hear 8:01 without the remix😂
Elite
Should be a W2S compilation. Harry carried.
Honestly sad it's not a real sdmn sunday but they deserve the day off
Wholesome🥺♥️♥️
Ffs 😂.
Best Youtube group of all time. Change my mind
Deepthroatmannnnnnn
The ending was so wholesome
34:31!! That edit though.
i got emotional in the outro
Why am I crying 😭😭😭cba
The end got me
https://youtu.be/keFGeahanME
Half this comp is just JJ: I’m gonna die
this was the year i got into side men so good luck 2022 😄😄😄😄👏👏👏👏
Im sorry to say it boys, but this is the beggining of the end.
I’m annoyed this is the sidemen Sunday today like come on man 😤
9:19 is absolutely hilarious. The snap and the angle
What a bad Sidemen Sunday
The last bit, the transition from Karaoke to Montage is sick AF. Given me some Ideas.
I think we are in for 1 more year before they will be gone :(
9:17 thank me later!
Could’ve put the whole tinder video in
Lazy sidemen sunday I see
that ending tho..... damnnnnnnn
7:27 they got Proffesor from Money Heist in the back lmao
i didnt wait a week for this
dude the last bit actually brought tears to my eyes
This actually made me quite emotional 😢. This year has been carried the side men. And am sure they will every other year. Can we get a "THANKYOU❤" line plz
Brilliant, I guess we'll see what happens gonna next... 😂👌
24:45 what is the vid name?
Y’all made all my sundays better
Boys fancied a week off then ;) let’s hope 2022 is as good if not better 🔥
22:12 I never understood what Harry said, can someone tell me cause it was too fast and mumbly to hear.
Its Not What We Wanted, But Its What We Needed
Lame 😒
Not me still laughing silently at the silent library clip 😂😂😂😂😂
bruh I teared up then burst out laughing towards the end
Noooooooo
Love these guys been watching only for a couple years but I can see how much love and passion they have. It’s amazing to watch, and have a Happy New Years!
Cheap vid excuse 😂
This is the reason why we should have a dislike button
Anyone else get kinda sad at the montage?
Such Bangers
This was sick I bet 2022 will be way better lol
Bruh I literally laughed through this whole video lol
is that stranger things music??
The end was so wholesome
Gawd dayum, I may have shed a tear at that outro
8:01 every time I hear that I can only think of the remix
we all now that was coming
it’s a stinker
Stop getting mad at them for making a compilation. They film videos all week for us, and run multiple companies. They are busier than all of us watching this video in our spare time. Give them a break, they deserve it.
Is it just me or JJ says "yeah babe" at 7:17? HAHAHA
This is a big step up to their other compilations, good job👏
W
I WANT MORE GIBB
What an ending 35:27 😂
Deserve a rest but this ain't it 😭
What a banger
8:00 i just can't get that song out of my head
Bruh
Brilliant video, the end got me emotional ffs😭
Humble outro love u guys
calfreezy in a wig made my 2021
We love the sidemen and I won't stop  loving yall youtube kings are here
It’s gonna be sad when they leave youtube 😭
Before yous all get wifed up i need more travelling videos pls
is this a joke?
Wish I had a family   like dis 🥺
JJ falling over in Pub Golf is an elite moment  P.S. nah on a real “A. Luke B. Emia” is actually unreal 💀
I can here the bug in the car with the auto tune
This is the Sidemen Sunday ?!
Petition to see a notha 5 a side with tobi commentating🙏🏽
21:37 my favourite  Ethan and Harry god combo
Thank u Sidemen!
On the main channel, not even MoreSidemen!!!
Never noticed JJs pink shoes in that video
That ending before jj was sick 🤝
U deserve a day off but ffs lol
A montage on the main channel??? Wut
Jj got that auto-tune screams😂 (years of experience)
Love that "we'll see what happens gonna next" is in 😂
they fr won a million pounds bcs josh has a constipation phobia
ksi and the way this man nuts up about bugs will be my fave forever
honestly this was so good. look forward to ss every week!!!
The ending was so smooth
what a wholesome ending
Please never retire
What video is that @ 00:50
lool we called it, compilation
i’m pretty sure calfreezy missed the 2000 bc update he still kinda looks like a cave man
Any billionaire would pay his life's worth for what these boys have....
gosh I love them so much .
This is the sidemen Sunday wtf!?!?! Re used content lol might as well kick the dead horse
Didn't wanna cry but looks like I am
NOT COMPLAINING ABOUT THE LENGTH but i thought this could be longer only cause Sidemen have had i wear countless amounts of best moments this year. Like this video could just be 6 hours long lmao. Big up the sidemen boys and all the crew, editors, etc, for the best year of content!
The Greatest group in the world
last bit gave me Goosebumps
Anyone else almost cry at the end😂🥲
9:17 the best moment in Sidemen History
The end montage was actually awesome 🥲
Nice
8:01 best song ever
lazy video
19:17 that transition was COLD
Literal chills during the Holiday part
Harry needs to chill, He stays wrecking people with snowballs and exercise balls 😂
JJ dropping the fish is more evidence of me asking “how has he beat Logan?”
We all knew this was coming...  Anyway, enjoy the holidays for the boys
I knew it I knew it would be a comp
This is a second channel video
Finally a good montage
Beautiful video!
Life would be a dull place if it weren’t for the sidemen
bro i cant have been the only one crying at the end
Amazing year of content boyos!
Much love from SA 🇿🇦
that edit at the end gave me goosebumps
Is this the sidemen sunday
Really enjoyed this montage, lots of great memories of the past year!
Saw this one coming
35:06 wholesome moment
19:14. That transition is so cold 🥶
Ffs
Bit of a cop out video but they work that hard to be fair they deserve a break 👍🏻
Woah those 36 min flew very fast
Stinker
This took me over an hour,because i had to rewind so many times Best video yet
Honestly jj carries
what a shithouse wtf thats so unfair lazy mfs
It's a shame that they censor it whenever they swear, but otherwise this was a great compilation
So what time is the actual sidemen sunday video coming out today??
11:25
Harry saying innocently the most outrageous things is the funniest thing ever
Why did the end make me emotional lmao 😭
dislike
21:58 what did he say? It was very unclear
theses guys have grown so much, from recording in their rooms to getting married, relationships and their friendship is elite.
8:03 OMG!🤣🤣🤣
Biggest scam of a vid
10:27 the genuine shock in harry's voice as he says "HE'S GOT LEGS" is so damn funny
When Harry was in the bin I laughed so hard my Gatorade came out of my nose
YouTube legends
Harry is hilarious
Best channel on the internet
Kept me smiling and laughing when it didn't seem possible, all the best boys.
Vik Ethan and Harry on the icy bridge is the sickest shot of the year
theres nothing these guys cant achive BIG UP The Sidemen
no one:   literally no one:   sidemen fans that subbed 3 months ago: "I DONT LIKE COMPILATION VIDEOS POST SOMETHING BETTER OR IM UNSUBBING. CANCELLED + RATIO"
What a wholesome ending
Casi lloro maldición 🥺
such a banger of a video, good vibes and everything
U lot never say no to free money
what was the first video
Best ppl ever and the best YouTube channel ever
honestly no one can beat the sidemen they will live on forever
Everyone that came from Harry’s twitter is disappointed
Got really emotional at the end!! What a beautiful friendship
Bruh, could have been second channel vid. Yes I’m complaining it’s once a week vids lol
19:19 is a crazy edit lol
💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
yess!! yesss sidemen!! exactly what we wanted
Twitters going to be in uproar
1.37 whats the name of this video
So this is like Sidemen shorts compilation!
What about a collab with nelk
Yung filly saying clapped to the girl gets me in tears every time... u guys definitely get filly and harry p back
The ens actually had me tearing up😢
Harry’s ninja violation gets me everytime
People acting surprised when they do a compilation when they do one every year around this time. Smh people are so self centred
8:45 which video??
god i hate these videos lmao 💀
19:50 eMoTiOnAl DaMaGe! 22:11 EmOtIoNaL dAmAgE! 2
Sidemen week off 😂
Great video!
“I waited all week for a montage”
I’ve never laughed so hard in my life
THIS TOOK ONE YEAR TO MAKE AND IT'S A COMPILATION IM UNSUBSCRIBING I CBA WITH THESE SIDEPEOPLE ANYMORE 😡
This ngl is kinda disappointing
<3333333333
the transition from the karaoke into holiday was smooth
WTF is the bullshit??
Harry said this video took a year to make and this is what we get.... He didn't lie but like bruh
Don't hate on the compilations, the boys are getting some rest, they deserve it
Sdmn had a great year man 2021 nothing but excellent entertainment
what video is at 8:30?
What song is Harry listening to at 4:50
i wonder whats happen gonna next in 2022
Just some really really good memories......
What a year but I'm really surprised Theo baker wasn't in here when they were doing that one blind dating video
The ending was so wholesome, even I sang at the end.
I got emotion at the end. Sidemen are the best. When their gone I'm gonna be sad man. Big up sdmn. Lots of love 🙂
Sidemen > The World
I actually don’t mind the compilation. It reminds us of the classic Sidemen moments throughout last year..
Can we have another Logan Paul with sidemen collab.
best edits ever
The clip at the end made me cry mates, not gonna lie it's everyone's dream to have a friend group like sidemen
NDL NDL
Kudos to JJ for always keeping it real!
Those transition edits was cold🥶👏
“WE WAITED ALL WEEK FOR THIS…”
Ksi is gone for a week... sidemen fked up...
What video was this? 0:09
that foul on jj was just racism
Am I the only one who's teared at the end of the video?
What is the name of the first video
get phil in a charity match
Sidemen carried 2021! And will in 2022 ❤
When Ethan said a little sprinkle of autism still kills me lmfao 😂
I love them so much 😞💗
i just started watching the sidemen consistently in the fall of 2021 and im so glad i did.
yessssss i suggested the ninja clip as a short ages ago lmao
so grateful for the sidemen ❤️
We need more Phil!
Do a montage of KSI dying
I loved this
Good video just wish this was posted on second channel, Was excited see a new video today
Epic
What we need to cure our midweek boredom this week: MoreSidemen - SIdemen Best Bloopers Of 2021
The more sidemen video🙄
Great compilation, but I am missing the hide and seek clip, where JJ sees Josh on the balcony and the door is locked. That was jokes
The ending actually made me smile so hard 😂😂
L
Still cant get over the fact how JJ laughs in the Car video
I would like to thank the sidemen for being my support system this whole past year . ❤️
This may be the final Sidemen Sunday I am gonna be able to watch.  Thanks guys for everything.
Each video being 1 hour long and the best bits is only thing long? Disagree
The holiday montage at the end gave me goosebumps these guys are the goats
Copout video
The ending is soo satisfying🥰
28:47 what video?
JJ every time " IMMA DIE IMMA DIE IMMA DIE" Love this 😂😂 For real tho Sidemen carried 2021 so hard... hopefully a better 2022 for all and more banging content🙌
I was really hoping for a sidemen big fat quiz 2022
The editing and transition in this is awesome. So wholesome go watch these boys live such a purposeful life
this video was hilarious and their videos in 2021 were awesome, hoping for the best in 2022 aswell!
2021 was elite🍿💥
Bro the transition at 19:18 is sick
Beautiful video man
Sideman helped me through a lot in 2021
U lot have to get filly, chunkz and hp back they arę to elite
Ending was so wholesome and Harry kissing Simon's head just shows the love they have for each other x
What a year with the sidemen can’t wait to have another great year watching these guys
Their off day
I am so drunk right now
❤
carried the year
Bs
Sidemen helped me through 2021 through their brilliant content, can’t wait to see wha they bring to 2022
Literally best outro
That transition at 19:18 was too smooth
To see how far they've came its crazy
Theo mimicking the dirty dirty in that blind dating is an underrated moment
Wholesome
I would love to see SidemenReacts to this video
The ending was everything.. when holiday was playing 🙌🏾 😍 😭 ❤ 💕 a bunch of our favs
«Im gonna die» -ksi
we can all agree that harry is the funniest/clumsiest sidemen member ever 😭😂
Crazy year huh😂
04:49 song?
This had me so emotional 🥺❤ I'm so proud of them.
Sidemen compilations... sry but that's the only videos I'll dislike, but what a great year thx Sidemen
This literally should have been a more sidemen video
‘holiday’ just makes everything so much more wholesome😮‍💨
This is how many times jj said "I'm gonna die"
😘
Bruuhhh thee end got me cryiinggg
I love the Sidemen and they have been a big part of my childhood and my life. I look forward toward the future and I wish each and everyone of them the best!
TBH this should be in more sidemen ,I was waiting for this sidemen video soo much
What vid is the first CLIP from?
Omg that ending 😭🥺
The best compilation video i've seen in my life love the sidemen and crew❤️
Keep going going
What is the first clip om
“ I waited all weak for a compilation “
Harry is the most funniest sidemen on god 😭
Best group in YouTube history
Best group on YouTube, no one can top them🔥❤️
i love sidemen man. they literally the best
the robot wars video would probably have banged it if was a tournament and 2 sidemen on each team.
PLEASE does anyone know what video 21:48 is?
A Side Plus promo at the end of a compilation video…the cheek of these lads!
Then singing holiday was the biggest highlight.
That was Dubstep 🤣😆
Very good year for them looking forward to 2022 for them
Bruh sooooo thankfull to these guys ❤️❤️❤️
What is the name of the song at 18:10 ?
22:15 still dont understand what hes saying
Can’t wait to see more
Let’s make 2022 an even better year, congrats on the success Lads!!!
8:04 the moment of truth.
Wow the ending was top tier
Congrats Sidemen
honestly big ups to u lot for somehow making 2021 ur best year yet despite the ongoing pandemic
Why do some of these videos seem like years ago 🤯
Goat friend group
Iv been a fan of sidemen since they were at 450k subs but I think there content has just dipped from the last year or so
That transition was smooth asf 19:13 💀 😭
We need a big fat quiz of the year next
Gib needs to be in more Sidemen videos
Harry the god of special moments
27:00 that was easily the hardest I laughed the entire year.
L
They only did this coz JJ in LA
the end of this video was amazing! cheers to the next year!
what video was the drone clip from😭
Fs. Let’s see stuff we’ve already seen a thousand times 🙄
Ah man. U used this as a main channel video. Where's the ideas gone guys
What a year it has been
notice how most of them are harry
DISAPPOINTED!
the best video 🥺😢😍
What a banger of an outro
Bro i am going miss these guys when they stop uploading🥺😍❤❤❤
What a smooth way to end the video with holiday
The balls on that camera man tho 8:32
shout out to the editor these transitions are nuts mate
I already watched all of that...
8:02 completly got me
Sidemen gone clear
Bro Sidemen hide and seek in the 100T cash app compound
the best part was when ksi thought he was gonna die
Best thing ever gonna watch in 2022. Watching this on repeat for the rest of the year ❤️
Tbh compilation videos aren’t always the best but the EDITING on this one made it UNREAL well done editors.
the last part of the video made me emo af
Seriously no one can top these boys.
I’ve never wanted to be a sideman more than this. The end gave me chills
Here’s to another year of the sidemen 🥂
L video smh
Well see what happen gonna next
nah i didnt know i needed this vid but i needed reminding
Best Channel on Youtube no doubt
“Year to make”
ending almost made me cry fr
Not gonna lie after another year of difficulties throughout the world, Sidemen were always there to provide entertainment and endless laughter throughout. By far the best group of Youtubers and no doubt will have more top content throughout this year, thanks for carrying 2021!
Phill needs to be more involved cuz he’s needed
Did JJ call Simon 'Babe' @ 7:22????
Ok here’s the compilation
Everyone: "They Deserve time off" Me: "Theres a reason why every CLIP SHOW in anime is seen as the worst one"
Why did the ending make me emotional 🥺
The editing in this video was 🔥🔥🔥 2021 was my first year being a sidemen fan and I can't wait to see what they achieve in 2022!
Half of this was ksi saying I'm gonna die
we need a IMMA DIE DIE compilation including remixes
This video makes me so happy, thanks for making this year a lot better for us all
Making the UK proud for another year!
What a let down
Best YouTube group of all time hands down 🌟
Do a tally of who won the most Sidemen challenges.  I’m assuming it’ll be Josh(no surprise there)
8:02 just can't get that tune out my head anymore
<3
Eliteeee
Thanks Sidemen for another great year of content!
I’m Pretty much convinced  That one day   Ethan will be found swaying at the back of a pub mumbling  “I used to be in a group called the sidemen”
Gibber 😂😂😂😂
Where can I find the second clip? cause i never seen that buzzer video before
SICK ENDING
I think they gave up because the sidemen can do so much better than this
So wholesome how they hype eachother up alot true friends
we'll see whats happen gonna next 😭
That ending transition with Holiday 🤌💯
5:39 jeeeez that transition 👌👌
Best best best... ❤️❤️ Legend's
God bless spread the gospel
I think that the ending is what friendship actually is
the intro gave me stranger things vibes!
It’s actually amazing to see that the lads have so much fun and enjoy themselves as well as making the best content possible for us, happy new year❤️
……..
w
When u have nothing to upload so u upload this
epic!!!
this was a compilation of shorts...and i love it
What a year for Sdmn! Cant wait for more and gassed for JJ out in LA with Prime, along with Sides and Xix. I need sides in my area! Gang 💥👏
As much as I hate this I have to let them through
Why do I want to cry at the end part wtf ahahaha
The ending was the best
NOOOO i have been waiting 3 weeks for a sidemenclothing discount code, and its not here...
i cried at the end
Even though the past 2 years have sucked, The sidemen have kept us all entertained.
Entertainment for an entire year! Great work boys!
Editor take a bow.
17:54 honestly JJ is the one guy who carries every party
They are getting bare brave with YouTube disabling the dislikes
This video could have genuinely been about 5 hours long. Can't wait to see what's next!
I like how in insta the comments were turned off about this video's announcement 🤣
Why a compilation 😭
Harry mostly made the year. lol
Why did I actually get emotional at the end?
The ending part from 33:45 to 35:26 was so wholesome it made me cry .. i really love them 😭❤️❤️❤️🙌
Such a cop out video
I'm not having it this is a MoreSidemen Video 😂😂
We waited a Sunday for this
The transitions were 🔥🔥 ngl
Why is the ending making me tear up??????
Whats that song at 4:53 I forgot
outro straight gave me goosebumps, this year was a whole roller coaster. :))
Who knew that 7 guys having the time of their lives whilst filming it could be so wholesome, literally the all time goats of youtube. Heres to 2022 🎉🎉
ayo harry did most of the lifting when him n ethan lifted jj into the bin 👀
I'm never gonna get over the "it's ecstasy for Harry" line Stephen tries dropped 💀💀💀💀
This was so wholesome
Its just all Harry lmao
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gn5o0I_txU&t=1s&ab_channel=UniversalTOPics
Another year of absolutely no memorable moments from Tobi 😂 mans literally the sidemen sideman
Who else has replayed the last part of the video like 20 times
Im happy for the boys but im also sad that i will never come close to something like this or friends like these.
0:43 Looks like Harry has been practising dodging with Gibbo
LEGENDS
Ending got me ❤❤❤❤
The sidemen single handedly got me through 2021.
BOOOO
Fake sidemen.
I actually dont mind the compilation sidemen had bangers this tear and just watching all the funny parts of the best ones is just the best
What a year boys 2022 here we come and looking forward to it ❤❤
"I wAiTeD All YeAr fOr A 36 MinUtE CompLaTioN"... joking obviously this vid was sick and 2021 was a sick year for the sidemen an 2022 will be even better
Is this really all we're getting for Sidemen Sunday?
Big up Sidemen!
the outro was SOO GOOD!!
Best Sidemen Edit Ever!!!!!
Sidemen saved 2021 hoping the best in 2022
The ending when they start singing then a little highlights of the year the feels
Wasn’t expecting to tear up on a Sunday morning
Even after watching all of there videos all of the moments were so refreshing
such a good video
Sidemen never miss
That was one hell of a year for them.
pause and go to 1:46
Arsenal lost 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This probably wont get more views than the rest of their videos but everyone who is watching it is a true OG. Cheers to the sidemen
So happy I’m living through this era of YouTube
The last part of the video was emotional for me I grew up watching the sidemen since I was in middle school
Jj and the sidemen have been all over the place(hehehe) this year, we'll let them off.
Wow really, it’s shorter than an actual sidemen vidoe
i could genuinely cry. growing up with these boys is definitely one of the most valuable things about my childhood♥
I bet we get more content with filly chunkz and hp
KSI hitting the drone will always be my favourite bit ,the way he fell down 🤣🤣🤣
The end had me a little tearful
This is getting emotional bruv I see brothers not friends
KSI screaming is the best 😂😂
What an awesome year this was for the sidemen.
Thanks for making 2021 better sidemen💕❤️
Hardest laugh of the year for me 9:21
As if we didn’t watch every video
Ah man a compilation
Shout out to whoever edited the transition at 19:17
20 million subs till the end of 2022, let's go
Elite!
Actually banging compilation
They’ve had an amazing year yet, let’s see if they can do better this year. Tbh I wish they made this video and a proper sidemen Sunday as well
Always make the best content
Someone deserves a yellow card for this! Cop out
.
27;05
We all new it was coming this was inevitable💀
SICK FAM TOOOOO LITTT  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Where is vik in the thumbnail??
The editing on that idiot was sick
I can't watch the sidemen car challenge KSI bug moment normally since listening the song from KSI's reddit
that ending honestly gave me shivers. it’s just amazing how far they have come & I can’t wait to see what they do in 2022!
Great ending
Thanks for bringing happiness to our lives. Watching from 2013. Still a long way to go.
Best 36 min of my life
what an amazing year for these boys
11:20 my favorite moment 😂
Was waiting for a banger 😩
Is this week sidemen sunday a day off?
Nice
Nothing but LOVE.  I FEAR THE DAY WHEN THEY STOP UPLOADING
"Round of applause for the taliban"
2021 was a great year for this channel and I hope this year will be too🔥
The end of the 2021 review made me actually cry😭😭😭😭 it felt like the end of the best youtuber worldwide 🥰🥰🥰🥰
I need a friendship like this
Bro this is fire
I won't lie I want 20women Vs Tobi it would be live
What video is the first one?
I can't take the music out of my head 8:01
so emotional, love the sidemen hope for a better year
Transitions are coooold
Best yt video ever dying of laughter🤣
Another bail out video cmon, this is more sidemen content
19:17 that is the coldest transition i've ever seen Big up the sidemen editors :D
Silent library was my favourite SDMN video of 2021! SDMN carried 2021 and were such a big part of my life. The last part of this video really made me emotional. Love the SDMN! 🤎🍻
Damn the ending of this really hit me in the feels 😢
Truly amazing but wouldve been better if all the sidemen reacted to this together and the reaction video wouldve been the sidemen sunday
the end of the video felt like its the end of the SIDEMEN
josh is so funny as tommy tate lmao
Your outro”s are just amazing. The leave us with a sense of fulfillment 👍🍾
I have a feeling Sidemen Tinder would be savage if it was reversed.
no one will ever match the amout of happiness the sidemen bring to our days and lives. every sunday we get through all the problems thrown at us just thinking that at the end of the day there's gonna be a sidemen vid to make the day a thousand times better. just makes us forget everything and puts a smile on our faces. big up the lads. happy new year sidemen youre the greatest
Big ups to the editors. The transitions are sick on this video!
good compilation
Silent library was a banger do part 3
Harry legend♥️
17:40 that hit was so funny😂
Dead. Aight gn everyone
Expecting for a sidemen sunday
Hilarious
So disappointed this is this week's video😑
They deserve a free pass considering they’ve carried the uk YouTube scene for at least 4 years now
Lazy
This was their best year
Man i love the sidemen.....best youtubers ever
KSI getting hit by that elastic is the moment of the year for me.
at the end of the video when jj starts singing makes me think that this is the end of the sidemen as it is like an end of a film where theres a song playing
the sidemen made the 2021
thankyou for the amazing year
Helicopter Helicopter was just golden bruv
Big ups to JJ for not dying in 2021 after clearly been in many situations where he was defo "gonna die"
It was a hard year for a lot of us. Thanks for making it better Sidemen ♥️
8:47 😂
27:01 this moment 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This gives back so many memories 😀
JJ and the silent library elastic slap is without doubt the best moment never laughed that hard
Yawn.
Amazing year guys, helped me through it all
I love the sidemen so much they make me happy when I am not and respect to them to all the commitment even through COVID 🙏🙏🙏🙏
Nooooooooooooooooooooo, but iloveyou guysssss!
19:17 Smooth Chip
i didn’t know this was moresidemen
ffs
still dont know what Harry Pinero said with the chewing gum bar in the tinder 3 video
not that this should be a more sidemen vid
1:48, Calfreezy is the new iron man repulsers sound effect.
6:17 got me on the ropes
Ending almost made cry.   Here before 2023, let's make it then together lads...
Tnx sidemen for unforgettable moment in 2021 wish u the bist
lets goo
BRRRRRRRRRRRRRUH they really didnt had a video to upload so they made a watch mojo video
10:26 Man Rafe has some legs on him, didn't know he could run that fast
I don't know why, but the ending compilation made me happy.
I wish I had friends like the sidemen but I lived last two years of quarantine with sidemen so this video have really made me emotional
Everyone dislike
That 19:17 transition was absolutely top tier
This is probably this best thing ever.
Love this! Great enough to bring tears to a man's eye.
Ending was just too wholesome 😫
Waits all week for sidemen sunday, literally everything we've already watched
sidemen carried my years
What does HP say at 22:08? to this day i still cant make it out lmfao
2:40 Buzz Lightyear in a wig
Don’t know how people are gonna be mad at this video, they make one every year as the first video of the year
ethan payed someone to do his part 😭
A whole week for this 😔😔
This video is so last year!
I can't the ending has me sobbing 😭😭
Which vid is the first clip from and the 0:40 one too??
The fact that ethan let someone else do this for him makes it so much better as fans find things funny that the sidemen may not see as funny.
Ugh I don’t want to watch this
WOW they are so lazy that they making a recap of 2021 10 days in 2022 I am dissapointed
Josh had some great moments this year.
Please do a Sidemen the amazing race
gib is so underratted we need more of him
them singing holiday is the most wholesome clip of 2021
Sidemen have been one of my faves since i was a teenager but they've seriously out-done themselves this year and carried 2021 fully. I truly cant wait for 2022 with these guys, they've come so far and achieved so much - excited for the future! Keep it coming guys <3
They posted a compilation and it’s only 30 mins long… I’m done
gimme the sidemen sunday 2021 tier list as well now
Sidemenforever.
The holiday edit at the end ❤️❤️
The Sidemen never fails to make us laugh every video is funny

BIG W
Waited a week to watch something I could’ve searched
From only hearing them having chats while gaming together until now, never failed to push the boundaries
Yo the end montage was too cute fr

The arsenal women video was the best in my opinion.
Uploaded a compilation video because jj was busy with Prime Hydration
The editing was too sick ❤️💯
Do people not understand that they are literally getting to watch free content every week from the sidemen and yet call them lazy for having just one week of after posting consistently. I don't get these people
thankful for the sidemen boys
Rahhh they really wanted a week off
“i waited all week for a compilation!” - not real sidemen fans
all jokes aside this montage was actually sick
The sidemen should recreate the apprentice it would be sick
Ayo wtf
Wow a more sidemen video

Should eat tho at some point 💀😂🤣
Got baited by harry
When Harry kissed Simon’s forehead 🥺♥️
What a bad sidemen Sunday put it on another channel

Shithoused it this week
greatest sidemen moments
What a year this has been. Sidemen reacts to more sidemen to all the sidemen sunday 👏👏👏
Personally not a fan of these type of videos. Little to no effort except for one or two editors. But hey, I'll allow it, previous Sunday was dope. And they probably want a well deserved day off.
Ehan paid for his part of the vid 🤣🤣
The day these man retire idk what I’ll do
Allow it man
I do not care, I waited 7 days for a compilation!  Now we riot!
Shoutout to the editors in the Sidemen Channel(s). Always giving us the best edits and transitions. Big UP 🔥🔥❤
Harry is in almost every clip lolll
the ending was so wholesome
The boys singing holiday with jj👌🏽🤌🏽
The last bit really brought a big smile and tears it was just sooo cute❤️😍🥺
the end of the video was mad!! amazing 🥺❤️
ksi dies a lot
Yes, one day All of this will end. I fear that...
Sidemen really made this year somewhat bearable for me, well done lads ❤️
Crazy how I remember all of these clips wth😄
The sidemen speed dating vid w Theo will always make me laugh
Damn no video today tho🙁
Stinker of a video
THIS Video should have Been a Moresideman Video and not a sideman sunday, but THIS Video is still jokes
Where are the sideman awards

1:47 ladies and gents, the cart titan.

This is all KSI and Harry but it’s gold 😂😂
Its been 7 years since they started (which lines up with the number of members) as nothing. Now there making millions, made it mainstream, have there own: Clothing line, games made about them, book, food line, other merch, literal plaques, entertain millions globally and carry an entire country of 66M people when it comes to how to become successful, entertainment and humour. Happy 2022 to all the sidemen, camera crew, editing crew e.t.c. And to everyone reading this & all the fans. Let's beat Omnicron and make 2022 count. XIX!
The best group of lads in the uk this had me in stitches the whole way through! 👌
Yo this boat about to go down... We about to sink
The clip at the end of them all singing KSI’s holiday always gives me goosebumps😭 just shows how far they’ve all come 💙

8:05 autotune sound is stuck in my head
I slightly disappointed its not a normal video ur bascially just repeating things I've already watched
My Family!!!! 🥰
WHY AM I CRYING???????? 😭❤

35:38 KSI's brain had a glitch that he forgot english 😂😂😂

Might sound Like a p*ssy but the bit where Holiday was played as the background music got me crying a bit
Absolutely incredible 2021, so many amazing and funny videos, id love to be in a sidemen video, bu heres to an even better 2022
Bro the nostalgia when Vik hit the crossbar🥺
Best Sundays of my life
Just a Question. Who was the best Sidemen in 2021?
Those all cuts are true beauty
why is this the sidemen sunday could be on more sidemen instead.
They have the best life
NOOOOOOO I WAITED ALL WEEK FOR THIS
What video is ksi walking the tightrope in?
Harry carrying the video as usual 😂 my god this man is funny
Ethan what have u done?
I think I'm the only guy in the world who looks forward to Sunday every week, the sidemen made 2021 bearable, keep up your art in 2022
To the haters... If the Sidemen want to phone it in for some time off... Good for them. They work harder than almost anyone in these comments. Pipe down and jog on. XIX
got a week off
Huge L
the amount of times JJ said he's gonna die feels illegal
What is this
half off the video is jj going "i'm gonna die, i'm gonna die" 😂😂
Use me as a dislike button
Tearing up at the end I cba

The ending was so wholesome. Great year for the Sidemen and Youtube in general.
The montage at the legit brought such a big smile on my face
idk why people hate on compilations so much, I love them. If only this one was a bit longer...
The greatest ending to a video I’ve ever seen 😭😭
Genuinely this was the best sidemen videos overall. I couldn't stop laughing at silent library and tinder 🤣
Ethan getting tickled quite frankly had be on the floor laughing
Wow we have been scammed
so inspirational how far they have come over the years keep up the work!! 👍👍
Cop out
I swear to God, if I see people complaining because "it's a compilation," I'll put them on a list to assault them with a baseball bat.
Which video is 18:10 from?
Not only the content but the quality of the work / videography, editing, filming, sets, ideas and the final product that we see each week has been amazing
This is the best video they have made this year!
8:03 who else just hears the remix from his reddit lol
So many great memories, honestly fun to rewatch it all
The ending !!!!! 😂
why did I get emotional at the end omg
What would 2021 have been without the lads? Unthinkable!
I swear Ethan getting tickled moment looked like the origin story for the Joker. Torture laugh😂
This can also be called the "sidemen shorts compilation" 😂😂
Its mostly just ksi
Damn this video brought back memories from this year… such a great year
The ending made me shed a tear 😪
cant wait to see the hate comments got a compilation
Can't believe I waited a year for this
What a year ❤️
Bro, they easily have the best life lol

Sidemen literally carried 2021! Stay blessed for 2022!❤️ GOATS 🐐

We waiting for the next Tinder Video…
I used to always think like why do people hate compilation it's a week off like just let it be but man i didn't wait till 1 am in the night to watch a god damn compilation and it wasn't a long one either
These guys truly live a blessed life
1:23 it’s just the way vik doesn’t even look at harry like this is just normal behaviour 😭
They gave us so much content consistently last year so I'm not complaining that it's a compilation they made last year more bearable for me so they deserve a rest
Definitely the year of Harry!!!
Aey yoh  kinda heart touching at the last 👀✨❤️
The helicopter clip of harry is jokes
This should be on moresidemen! A whole week and no sidemen Sunday?

Stinky vid ngl
Yes I've been waiting for this 😊
2021 was sidemen.
Harry: This sidemen Sunday took a year to make   Those of us who watched Ethan on the podcast: ayt so the best moments of 2021 yeah 👍🏾
Who else can only hear the remix of the bug in the car clip when he said imma die repeatedly
this compilation literally gave me goosebumps
Lets goo
The holiday part was soo wholesome that I cried😭😭
Notice how harry is the main part in most of the funniest moments... guys an absolute legend
75% of the video is ethan laughing but we still enjoyed it 😁
19:13 that transition though
Ohhh boy! The ending made me cry!
"That was dubstep bro" they had me laughing for 5 minutes straight couldn't breathe I was laughing so hard my cheeks and my stomach are killing me lol
When ksi see bugs he turn in too a girl 🤣🤣🤣
Best video yet
no
So what it's a compilation. These guys deserve a little break once in a while. Especially JJ, he's been all over the place. (yes, I did that)
The outro is such a happy outro my lord. Makes me wanna cry
2021 was a movie
Can someone tell me what video the clip is from at 8:19 please?
This belongs in more sidemen. I wished for a more entertaining video. The rest I've seen probably a hundred times each.
this weeks just lazy ngl bro
Sidemen carried 2021
Should mention what video each clip is from
Amazing vid!!!
That ending tho 💯
My day has been made
Oi the ending was elite the transition in to holiday was 👌👌
i actually cried at the end. hope ur 2022 is as good as this 1!!!!
yo the outro is sick
34:30 Sick Transition
The ending tho 🥵🔥🔥
I waited so long for a complication !?!?!?!!?!?!?!
The last minutes got me tearing up damn don't do this to me 😭
Waste of a Sunday , just show videos we have seen nice 👍
literally chills from this video
I love the ending ❤️❤️, thanks for all the amazing vids this year , love side+
alternate title: 35 mins of sidemen clips
That last montage with holiday literally gave me goosebumps ☺😁
The transitions between clips was so sick. Shout out to the editors
sidemen really carried 2021
Anyone know what video that 8:45 is from?
Sidemen go to Australia, That would bang!
Too many funny moments exist that they cant fit them all in! Such a wholesome ending. On to 2022
the last bit was so wholesome!
Thanks for everything ❤️
Where was the "go on a hike" meltdown
Why this
Goats of YouTube
Sidemen productions presents this weeks Sidemen Sunday: Sidemen shorts!
literal 36 minute harry comp
this is a piss take
9:10 "he died in a house fire" still cracks me up
Which video is the part where JJ farted 6:14
Why do I feel like this is the last vid they will ever post lol I love them
I really wish I could live their lives for 1 day. It would be so cool
I loved this
"I waited all year for a 30 minute video!!!!" 😂😂😂
I want to appreciate the editors who probably spends 2 or 3 days (may even be more) a week a whole year editing videos for Sidemen and More Sidemen, probably whilst having other things to do as well, i.e studying! People say stuff like "The Sidemen film videos on a weekly basis and therefore deserves a break" but let's not forget the editors who do a massive job as well and who deserves a break just as much!
So pissed rn
That transition @ 9:26 was cold
compilatiooooon
The holiday song at the end 😍❤️
Why was that Holiday outro montage kinda emotional tho! Big year lads, can't wait for 2022!
"We WaItEd a WhOlE yEaR fOr ThIs!"
On January 9th…
Was hoping for an actual sidemen Sunday video.
Thanks for the vids lads don't stop ur killing it 👍 👏
We need part 2
literally carrying youtube in these hard times i'm glad i am here
Tell Logan to bring a bug into the ring - that's a TKO right there
Bro they actually made a compilation AGAIN well into the new year, like is they want a week of then put the compilation as the one right before new years or the one right after, like wtf
08:00 I cant get that song out of my head😂
nice video siuuuuuu
Absolutely beautiful 💙
Loved every moment of it
this is basically a sidemen shorts compilation 😂😂
We got scammed this week
So it's basically a SidemenShorts Compilation
That ending was lovely
The Song Transition at the end goes hard, thanks for making 2021 a bit easier and more entertaining for everyone!
Can't even be mad that this is a compilation. The boys earned a break and the compilation was still really good.
Really proud of the Sidemen. This year was just filled with banger videos !
❤️
incredible video!
I can just tell big fat quiz of the year is coming
❤❤❤🙏
❤
Transition game is solid 🔥
Y'all carried 2021. All the best brothers, it's only up from here.

Bro the 30:13 clip made me dead 💀
Neat
Love the sidemen bro
21:44 'he should eat though at some point' 😂😂😂

I could watch this over and over again!!!!!
Ethan’s laugh makes this video 10 times better
Best compilation ever
Waited a week to watch the least watched sidemen video of the year
Filler sidemen sunday but still good to see how much content they put out this year
The ending tho 🤩🤩🤩
Gg bois ❤
could someone tell me where 8:26 comes from
My funniest bit was in 00:41 Harry noise made me 😂
THAT ENDING WAS SO SICK
Sidemen are so good fair play
everyone is seething after seeing best of in the title lmao
Putting HOLIDAY in the end made it kinda emotional🥲❤️
what's the tune harry played around 4:50 ?
What a banging year for the sidemen. The ending with holiday lowkey got me kinda emotional.  Just a bunch of mates living life
😐
we need Gordon Ramsay video with sidemen that will pop off
Elite video.

sidemen on top
WHY DID I GET EMOTIONAL AT THE END AAAAAAAAA
Best guest appearance. Gib by far so funny
Ffs 🤦‍♀️
My disappointment is immeasurable
They have such great life ... I envy

That moment when holiday comes❤️🥺
Y do this
We knew it was coming
GOATS🐐🔥!!
Love the ending
That Holiday segment tho🖤
Just wow 👏👏👏👏
Vik is the true 🐐🐐🐐
❤❤
They really do deserve a break to take it easy, enjoy the New Year, enjoy Christmas. They have made a video for every week of the year  and are all dedicated for our enjoyment. Even on their own channels they worked hard. They have given us some of the best content out of last year, and carried YouTube(as usual). They give us something to enjoy or brighten up our Day if we are feeling down. A Well deserved break.  2022 will be another banger year
The transitions are so cool!
This group of boys is elite, all of them❤️❤️❤️ and the last 3 mins kinda made me tear up. I rate how consistent they are still, they must go down in the history books or something!!!!❤️
Oh my god. 🙌🙌🙌👏👏👏
20:25 lmaoo🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Nobody: KSI: "imma die imma die I'm gonna die"
Bro the end is amazing
FFS when is the Tinder Video coming?
19:29 This is the man beat Logan Paul in a fight
Never thought I would love a compilation so much
The ending *Holiday* made the video epic ❤️
I just love it when i get the pop up saying  "Someone has liked your comment" or " Someone has subscribe" it makes my day better"
sidemen carried 2021 like a  boss. Just subscribed to Side plus for the best content ever
Is it just me that hears the remix every time I wagch or listen to this clip at 8:00
that ending editing 👌👌👌❤️
He can't handle an intellingent lady Intellingent lady: So what's your name again? 😂😂
That ending actually got me pretty emotional 😭😭😭
22:12 to this day I still dont know what harry said
Wish they used his reddit edit on JJ's "uh, there's a bug bro"
Sidemen=W
transition at 19:17 was beautiful
not ashamed to say I got emotional during the end bit
honestl;y wouldnt be mad if they wanted to take a month or 2 break.They haven't missed a single sunday

😔
Can’t wait for all the “Omg I can’t believe I waited all week for a compilation sidemen Sunday!!” comments

I wish there was something above a like button to give this
6:16 "that was dubstep bro" 💀💀

W. The boys needed a break
COP OUT
This ending is sick wtf 🔥🔥
I vote for a second silent library
9:16 😂😂😂😂😂
Everyone who rages at this or clearly care enough to comment suggesting they don't care are clearly Molly Mae in disguise and not true fans
This video is 0 effort, it took Ethan 0 minutes to make.
Looks like this week I'm gonna have to find a side plus site mirror for my sidemen Sunday
The ending was so good omg

This is basically harry and JJs funniest moments 😂
We waited all week for a complication 🤬🤬…. Just kidding love u guys u deserve a break 👍👍

That ending with JJ was ELITE
THIS STINKS MAN
"that was dubstep bro"

And as tradition, the worst video of the year is here...Can't blame them though, they need a break!
Sidemen gave me hope and laughs in a dark time in my life especially during 2020-2021. Praying for even more success for these lads!
At 8:00 every time without fail I sing the song in my head😂😂
19:15 transition is cold
Is this the sidemen sunday🙄
Goats 🙏❤️
😶 Maybe We're The 1st Spiritist*** Pop-Metal Rock Band In The World... But Don't Pay Too Much Attention To Our Neanderthal English, HaHa ❤ ***NOTE: Spiritist is who professes Spiritism. It's the Bible continuation and correction. It has began with the books by Allan Kardec and continued in the books of Chico Xavier, the greatest medium/prophet of spirits of the last centuries...
I actually think all of the moments were their best moments They have been giving us quality content every year for the last year Huge props to them ❤️
22:44 classic 🤣
I love how everyone was expecting this one last week but they were like nope surprise and then this week we got it
IT’S BASICALLY SIDEMEN SHORTS BUT BIGGER  BUT WE TAKE IT THEY DESERVE A BREAK

Me: Wasn't New Year 8 days ago? Sidemen: Shhh! Focus on the rewind.
Oh what a letdown, wait a week for a highlight reel...
What a great video

This should be a MoreSidemen video
The transition between clips were clean
I think they are spitting up this year guys
harry playing the sad music lmfao i love harry so much
"He died in a house fire, we lost him," was the best line Harry did all year.
I can’t be the only one who loves watching the compilations
Can we get a video of jj and simon together pls
Amazing!
Oh
Harry casually playing a disstrack in the bin 🤝
8:00 the thing I can't forget in my life is sidemen and this clip .. 🤣🤣 ded bro ..imadie 😂

Stinky video

JJ getting whipped should have been the last clip to end the video
The ending was so humbling and happy, I need a friend group like this 😞
What a waste of a video imo
this should've been a moresidemen video
Harry's tweet really makes sense now lol 😂
“Sidemen sunday”😍😍😍 “It’s a compilation💀💀💀
ANYWAYS, CONGRATS ON REACHING 14 MIL SUBSCRIBERS
8:12 the song which someone made and posted on jjs Reddit was humming in my ears lmao

The game is the game 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
2021 would’ve been so boring without having sidemen to entertain us every week
these transitions are sick

8:03 The songs stuck in my head rent free

Why are they bluring evrything?
This was a very good year for the sidemen loved the vids boys💪❤️🔥
Bro...along with the video.....the thumbnail itself is a piece of art.....
18:23 is the best transition
What a year, straight bangers🔥
Sidemen literally carried 2021
Wth is this content? They really want us to pay for side+ huh
jj "im gonna die" olatunji
someone help with the name of the first clip video
I love these people
Bruh best moments.. Stfu all fangirls before y’all start bitching
Someone lmk what video this was at 1:36
Content is better than some netflix shows!!!
The sidemen are the best group out there no matter what
Now i get harry tweet, yeeeh this sidemen Sunday did literally take a "year" to make ya know
JJ’s screams sound auto tuned🤣
Cant wait to see what’s happen going to next in 2022
:)
LETS GOOOOO
Bruh
Worst sidemen Sunday
Sidemen videos are the best! They put in so much effort and they are funny. So happy that I found their channel in 2020! 💙
NOOOO I HATE THESE VIDEOS
So we get a compilation for our sidemen Sunday, pretty basic
Well that saved my weekend
8:00 Bro I can’t listen to this clip without hearing the tune😭
What a video to come back on 😭
Funniest moment : ksi in the silent library
Harry u cheeky asf. The tweet was such a clickbait
KSI's meltdowns are the best!!
I can't listen to that JJ and the bug clip without singing it in my head cause of that reddit post.
bruh 36 min comp for the whole year?
this is a lazy video for a sidement sunday lol but ill take it
The memes that came from these made 2021
This sidemen sunday took a year to make”  Bruh harry really had us in the first half ngl
really thunk the sidemen they are the best i was craying so much and depresed now i m smiling
uch a montonge
here early on
🥲🥲🥲
🙂💔
Vik's swimming flip was one of the best moments
BOOOOOOOO
Sidemen never deceive ! Big up!!!
Damn only half way through and already feel jealous 😂 big up sidemen every time ❤️
The best 36mins of my life !!😂
This should be MoreSidemen but i get it's difficut to make videos every sunday
Let's hit 20 million in 2022 🙏
Bruh, ain’t no body tryna see the same shi 🤦‍♂️
short and sweet what a great year for the sidmn
8:45 vid?
Harry’s tweet makes sense now…
15 year olds, stay mad.
Wroetoshaw, the only man who cannot get cancelled!🤣🤣
The best sidemen Video ever hands down 😂😂😂😂😂
In one of the food videos tobi messed up his kicky ups because of the flash so Kirsty 100% made jj fall 👌🙃
Ngl the transitions are outrageous!!!!
“Vid out today which has taken a whole year to make” lmao Harry was right
sidemen carried the year by posting every single week putting out banger after banger and some have the nerve to complain 😂smh
Let's get to 20+ million subs
I expect something great not worst
We waited a week for a 2021 video as if we all didn’t religiously watch theses video anyways 😂
Ffs man took a year to make yeah😭😭😭😭
8:00 , u have the tune in your head
oh nelly
Who got exited after harry's tweet and then got dissapointed 😂😂
Can’t wait for the bangers this year!
Can we have an actual video
So, this is virtually a bunch of clips from last year that didn't make it to sidemen shorts... Nah but on a real tho guys, thanks for all your content💯💯
This brings back all the memories of 2021. yall really made my year This video made me cry 😭✋
2021 was a good year for the sidemen
How lazy
Almost every moment has Harry
Let’s take a moment and appreciate all the hard work these 7 lads did for our entertainment. Hope everyone out there has a great year!
Not the compilation 😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫🤣
Best of luck in the New Year honestly your the best group on YouTube
This video guys
Yeah, it's a compilation, but look on the bright side, SidemenReacts is daily 😁.
Funniest year yet😭
It’s been a great year of the sidemen and 2022 is going to be even better
Vik kinda lame , apart from that sidemen is perfect
this is what harry tweeted about making of a video from 1 year. sidemen really fell off!
THE MOST AWAITED VIDEO.
We all knew it was coming
thanks for carrying this year frl
literally ruined everyone's year already
8:01 i can't un-hear  the beats
I forgot so many of these moments 😁😁😁😁
Guess Harry wasnt lying on his tweet.
for me 1:35 is the best moment
The greatest “sidemen” moments. Most of them are Harry’s
Is this the sidemen Sunday?
COMPILAAAAYYYYSHON
I’d have to say the mukbang was my favorite video of 2021. Hilarious 😂
Yay
im disappointed ☹️
8:01 To this day I can only hear the song in my head 😂😂😂
I remember when they always used to to compilations. I hated it. But like. I kinda Frgt. And now that they made one. I kinda miss them 😭
This is amazing can’t wait for more 2022 content!
2021 is a goated year for YouTube purely because of the Sidemen
sidemen kept us alive during 2021, i was surprised to see this video was shorter than a normal video from them
Amazing Content
This is so poor. "videos take so much effort than some people might think" - Lol, they're not exactly working hard are they. They are living the dream. They could of filmed 2 videos in 1 week, though, saying that, they probably can't due to Side+ which is behind a paywall. Sidemen have fell off.
Oh boy, Sidemen literally helped me survive throughout lockdown last year. Mad respect for their time and dedication to YouTube!
Could have given us an among us video
Knew this was coming eventually
First Sidemen video i ever disliked
the sidemen are the best group on YT ...
L video
6:16 bro im dying i forgot about this bit💀
Should’ve just given us a gta video instead
All the comments here telling people to stop complaining yet haven't seen a single comment complaining 😂
Idk why people hate compilations of these lads
This video is just a many sidemen shorts clips put together into one.
what was the video name the eletricr one 3 video
How DARE the Sidemen upload a compilation after ONLY 51 main channel videos last year, alongside with 3 second channel videos every week and 1 reacts video every day? Smh
Ngl this should have been a second channel video
Sidemen was our lifeline during the pandemic
Right let’s see where Behz Cheated 😂
👎
I waited a week for this bullshit I guess I have to get side +
is it just me or is it every time i see the "im going to die, its a bug bruv" i always think that the beat is gunna drop and its gunna be the song 😂
Wish the vid was an hour long I’m bored.
I'll comment it don't worry...."WE WAITED ALL WEEK FOR THIS?!"  But on a real tho, it's been such a great year, thanks for keeping me company throughout the worst couple of years in many people's life. Big up the sidemen.
FOR ALL THE UNGRATEFUL FANS: be grateful that they upload every day on other channels and they have their own lives too....
YAAAAY COMPILATION❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Thats first clip transition😂😭
A week and this is what we get???
Alternative title Hary’s  best moments
sidemen killed it this year:hopefully this year 2: HAPPY NEW YEAR Y'ALL
WE WAITED ALL WEEK FOR A COMPALATION IM UNSUBSCRIBING 😡😡😡
' WaItEd A wEeK fOr A mOnTaGe '
Kinda bummed out it's not new y'all are my favorite thing I watch lol
God damn it, Harry hyped me up on Twitter lmao, i still like the compilations tho
L
Guys no hate for the boys... the carried 2021 more than better.... can't let this compilation spoil 2022... they deserve a break for sure
Me and my food when we saw its a completion 😀😀
This is better that a actual sidemen Sunday
What a way to start 2022... No
L
Lazy video
Is this the sidemen Sunday
Harry wasn't lying with that tweet
5:40 he looks looks like a doll😭
There have been many years since the earth has came to form but I am glad I am born in the same era as the sidemen. ❤
0:09 wtf is wrong with harry? Is he inbred of something?
Phil running after harry 🤣
Are u being serious
good look
KSI: Im a Celebrity 2022?
Ffs 😭
Great Video 👍🏾
Now i understand what Harry meant by saying this week's Sidemen Sunday took a whole year in the making
I’m gassed
Sad its not a new video so to speak. Still grateful and loving the content. To bigger and better things in 2022
I love how Harry is in the majority of these. XD
Under 100k views chain👇
not me thinking im getting a banger but instead i get this
8:00 i fkn KNOW im not the only one who can only here the remix from jjs reddit lol
Holiday vid???? Lmfao
dunno why people mad at compilations its literaly a video with the funniest moments

https://youtu.be/OWDGTaYGfdg
I love how this is like 60% jj and Harry. Those two are just meme central.
Side channel vid wtf is this this blows
Why do they censor stuff now 😩

It’s ecstasy for harry
“Everyone coming to the comment section after seeing Harry’s tweet that spoiled the Sidemen Sunday”
BOOOOOOOOOOO

Noooo not a compilation, not to worry tho lads enjoy the week off
FINALLY LES GOOOOO
Only 365 days until the next compilation. Let the wait begin😍
8:45 is the best one fr
69th
Sidemen put 2021 on his back and made it so much more enjoyable even in hour lowest, hope he does it with 2022 aswell 🙏❤️
Sidemen legit carries UK
Editors job today
lol
Sidemen should be appreciated for everything they did in 2021 for us
Censorship? Bruh moment
2021 was sidemens year hopefully do just as well in 2022
This comment doesn’t deserve any likes
so much comments already
Only the OGs recollect a song at 8:00
I think it's safe to say JJ is scared of insects.
The editing is hard ngl😂👌
L vid
I WAITED ALL WEEK, FOR A 36 MINUTE COMPILATION !!!!!! 😡😡😡🤬😡
They hit 4 mill subs in one yr....WOW
All I can hear from JJ getting out of the car from the bug is the best remix going 👏🏻
Thumbs up for the amazing transitions. Lit editing man👍
8.40 this guy won from logan paul
They carried 2021
Noooooo
huh
8:00 is it just me singing the Fan Remake? xD
cant belive it. A compilation on THE MAIN CHANNEL.      .......
Here come all of the "wE wAiTeD aLL wEeK fOr tHiS" comments, they deserve a break
Cop out
pog
Sidemen literally carried 2021, hoping the best for 2022!
Ah yes, this the video that took years to make
This video or compilation is more like - THE GREATEST 'MY FAMILY' MOMENTS 2021❤ HAPPY NEW YEAR
These comments so funny 😭😭😭😭
The transitions between the clips is sick.
24:27 has me dead lmaoo
I would have been completely happy with the compilation if Harry did not kinda hype it up :(
this is the 9th and they make a montage?
I see a compilation, i comment, i dislike, i leave, i cry until next sunday
I was looking forward to sidemen Sunday not highlights 😢😢
Well, despite his many claims, JJ did in fact survive 2021 and he did not die
I feel like the sideman coming to a end soon
Respect for the hustle💪💪
Poor
Searched up shithousery in the dictionary and this video popped up.
A compilation...
sidemen carried 2021
Whenever I hear ksi scream in that car i remember that reddit edit
Its a howler
Na not watching
Waited all week for a compilation?? Me disappointment is immeasurable and my day ruined, thanks sidemen
ngl the little transitions in between are sick
Sidemen has carried the UK Youtube scene for the past 8 years. And they'll do it again this year.
Not gonna watch this video, but enjoy your vacation lads.
I don't hate these year end montages , it just that I have already watched all the Sidemen videos multiple times. But they deserves the break. So gonna watch and like it anyway.
8:05 it's impossible to not hear the remix💀💀
I thought I searched for sidemen why is more sidemen videos coming?
CAN WE SEE A SIDEMEN "I'm a celebrity get me out of here"?! PLEASE!
There is not a single person that can do a Try Not To Laugh on this video xD
🗑️
Sidemen carried 2021 and hopefully 2022
i'm not even mad that its a compelation because those legends carried 2021.
Ngl if we wanted to see another compilation we could just watch the videos again…
L video
What video was the first one from?
Harry complication😂😂😭
8:32 what clip is this video from?
CANT WAIT FOR THE SIDEMEN X MR BEAST COLLAB!
This is the first compilation I'm looking forward to
Lol yuck 🤮🤮
im crying with laughter
I'm crying 😂😂😂
Basically it is a compilation of jj screaming
I don't wanna see anyone complaining
I wouldnt even be mad if they took a break for themselfes and their family/friends
i waited a whole week for a compilation 😂 (i’m jk)
Whoever is reading this , your a king/ queen 👑
HARRYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
Scammed out of a vid lol
No matter how many hate comments out there , here's an appreciation comment from me to the sidemen ❤️
JJ already died 3 times because of bugs
https://youtu.be/DGnoaLpJr4U
So that means Mr Beast x Sidemen is happening next week
So many Harry LMAO moments in this I lost count 🤣🤣🤣
Harry really finessed everyone
Dead
Bots are ruining yt comments now
Best sidemen Ever
A 30 minute compilation as a sidemen Sunday ? This is barely 2nd channel worthy
I was actually disappointed when we didn't get the compilation last week so I'm glad we ended up getting one
Noooooo
hate that its a compilation, but i 100% love it as well
I thought it will be the Hide n Seek in Benidorm. Anyways, can't complain. Sidemen deserve a week off.
just don't give us a video instead of giving us this....say "we need a break" and sod off..atleast that way we don't have to wait
Sidemen rewind innit
JJ and bees were best😂😂
It was an amazing year, thanks for everything <3
One of the Funniest moment hands down , “are u a therapist?” And when harry runs through the tent when camping haha!
Hearing JJ saying "I'm gonna die" 100x is so funny
Thanks for entertaining us throughout 2021... more wins in 2022 ❤
why does harry fall over so much lol
WEAK VIDEO
Lol it‘s all Harry 😂
harry didn’t lie when he said it took a year to make this video😭😭

8:02 it's always a music in my ear 😂😂
2nd channel Video. 🤷🏼‍♂🤷🏼‍♂
I appreciate everything they've done in 2021 but I'm disappointed
7:33 JJ fully just dips his biscuit in the water
This should have been released on january 1st and we should have gotten a new video today but this video is funny af
5 mins ago dam, sidemen carried 2021 and im hoping more in 2022
2021 wasn't a great year. But the Sidemen definitely made it special, thanks for all the hard work and laughs lads! 🙌
The Fact they even included a moresidemen video. Cheeky
9:20 🤣
I knew it was coming and I'm happy their taking a break but it still kinda hurts😂😂 I'd subscribe to Side+ but it costs more than Netflix or my data plan😂
editing banging as always
Compared to 2021 this year had some stinkers imo😅
Guys stop this hate .. just enjoy while it lasts
Saw Harry's tweet was so hyped
Booooooooooooooo
Well deserved break!
I waited the entire week for a new vid. Looked at the title got bummed but this was such a nice recap 😭😍
KSI screeching at the top of his lungs is still the funniest thing ever
5:30 damn that transition

Would love to see the mandem play more board games! They can do it drunk too😂 would love to see them play Secret Hitler!
“I’m gonna die” is probably the best quote ever said in the video
Damn, i guess removing the dislike button is coming in handy
🔥💕👍
1 of the firsts😙
L
We hope 2022 will somehow be better than 2021.
8:01 Can't heat anything else but him singing it 😂
Can’t wait for more bangers out this year. Happy Nea Years lads!
Ngl I think jjs gonna die
Boooooooooooooo
arghh I'm mad but I'm not mad
Ffs a compilation 😭😭😭🤣
does put a smile on your face
8:02 who else still hears the tune
Yesss this is what I’ve been eating for😂😂😂
A compilation??? Seriously???
Harry’s tweet makes sense now
Can anyone please tell me which episode is shown @1.36
please dont say that this week upload is just a best off. :S not a fan of seing content i already seen before,
r u taking the piss...imagine waiting all week for a sidemeb Sunday and they post a compilation
DISLIKE DISLIKE DISLIKE. SCREW MONTAGES
cant watch the clip of ksi freaking out to a bug in the car without hearing the auto tuned version 🤣
Where is the first clip from
This can’t be the sidemen Sunday a compilation for the main channel is quite disappointing but oh well it is what it is
Is this the video for today. No offense but I have watched every sidemen Sunday so this is just kinda boating for me. But I do not mean any hate still love the sidemen
Jj dies 30 times in this Video
Fully smashed it last year lads
Compilation for sidemen sunday, great..
Nice
If anyone sees this comment please cut out Harry’s first shock and use it for like a mortal Kombat punch noise 😂😂😂
3:48 bro the tone in his voice and everything have me dead😂😂😂
Sidemen carried 2021 who agrees?
Some people get annoyed at complations but just think how much work they put in for the other weeks and the lengths they have went to  Congratulations sidemen have another banging year lads
Mad respect to the sidemen for actually not missing a single video and none of them being totally out of effort
I think it’s safe to say 2021 was one of the best years in sidemen history
7:36 😂
Y’all fluffed it
Cop out
The fishing with Logan Paul was my favorite video in 2021
I hate that it's a compilation rn but in a month or 2 I'll be very happy for it
my sadness is inmeasurable and my day is ruined
We all hate compilations, but we're still spending the next half hour watching this
Nah thats a cop out lol. Basically an omnibus, why am i gon a watch again?! Worse than a hide n seek
the sunday video is bits of what we have seen already? the 7 sidemen really went all out in 2022
5:45 we’ve lost him boys
waiting for the “IVE WAITED ALL WEKK FOR A COMPILATION” comments

Waited all this time and they give us a highlights package 🙄 f’kin hell man
Sidemen carried 2021! And will in 2022 ❤️
i’m very scared for the day they stop making videos
https://youtu.be/d4Tl9_bueX4
Someone ratio me plz
This might be due to mrbeast collab 🤨🧐
Didn’t expect it to be on main channel but hey ho at least they’ve uploaded
harry wasnt joking after all huh?
90% Harry 😳
I could watch 24H of this
Nooooo🥲
They deserve a week off with this past year. Thanks to the guys behind the camera for putting this together

No sidemen Sunday today lads just a montage it’s ok they work so hard
Amazing
thanks for all the laughs in 2021 lads
I honestly love these year-end compilations as it captures and reminds us of the best moments from the year that the lads have provided us. Big up the Sidemen, they're massive!
Big L
The sidemen carried 2021, a well deserved break for the boys and the whole sidemen crew, hope 2022 will be even better!!
Mad
I waited for this 🙄🙄🙄
That’s Sunday ruined then…
Silent library was definitely my fav vid of the year
W

I understand Harry's tweet now 😂😂
Harry really trolled us with his tweet
BEST YEAR OF THE SIDEMEN, HOPE A SICK 2022 ASWELL LY
Well Thanks Harry 😂😂
...
easy money video ;)
Litty for really
Great year of content keep it up
dead compilation
The ending of this vid is wholesome 😭
5:42 why Ethan look like a cardboard cutout of himself
Of all the Sidemen to deserve that shock collar, it should be Harry 😂❤
Stinker
bruh i waited all day for a compilation, still fire tho
meh
damn harry what a video.
Sidemen got me through 2021!! And I’m sure they’re gonna do great things in 2022!
Waited all day long for this , I mean fine 🙂
The lads really made 2021 an amazing year for me
Love how they are taking the piss out of the salty fans saying it’s just a compilation with that description
The Greatest YouTube Group Ever 🙏❤️
happy new year
I knew there would be a compilation because they didn't upload on MoreSidemen this Saturday too.
I can't even complain they need a break no cap 😂😂
yall lucky the dislike is off
LETS GO
Bad sidemen Sunday
Incoming the comments: I WAITED THIS WHOLE WEEK FOR A GREATEST MOMENT OF YHE YEAR VIDEO
Ayyy
Harry is in almost every single one😂
sad I waited all week just to see an compilation video😭😭
Sad to see It's a montage but I'm sure I'ts still a banger
W
Ethan worked hard on this vid
This video is essentially the hardest sidemen video to create. Let’s give it up for these hardworking, funny, and all around amazing individuals! And cheers to another year with the Sidemen! 🥳🙏
4:44 Very iconic 😂
Yessir
this video has me in bits already
Yes it is a compilation, but let's just appreciate the effort they made during 2021. Well done lads👏
Missed this sunday
I wanted a new video😣 Nonetheless I'm gonna watch this
Don't tell me this is the Sidemen Sunday 😔
My Disappointment is Immeasurable and My Day is Ruined
the dedication put into the videos is unreal
really? a compilation? 😐
9:20 elite 😂 one of the best moments of the year
Should've known when Harry said they took a whole year to make this video
I'm glad i's a compilation!
AH ANOTHER YEAR!
Im not gonna watch it cause ive seen all the vids, robbed of a sidemen sunday yet again, keeps happening every year haha Still, good year guys.
We appreciate the content but Harry didn't need to give us hopes for this
Me who was expecting the hide n seek
This is the one time, it'd be jokes to see the dislikes
crazy that this video took one year to make
They’re on a break that’s why they posted this
The Best Of The Bunch
1:38 DOnt touch IT DOnT ToUCh my Drone
is this the sidemen sunday video or just a extra??
Use this comment as a dislike button.
🔥🔥🔥
Harry tweet finally makes sense
What a video this will be
Legends <3
It’s been a good year but for someone who watched every sidemen Sunday for a few years these montages feel like 2nd channel content Also, I hope this montage means they are working on something big
Here
Why a mantoge that is so bad
When is the sidemen Sunday vid?
Lets just appreciate everything the sidemen did for us in 2021
Anyone who saw the tweet: Not surprised whatsoever
so this is the sidemen sunday for today?
At least upload a pro clubs video lol
The Sidemen litteraly carried 2021. Didnt miss a single Sunday. Also produced videos on the SidemenReacts and MoreSidemen, etc. Legendary.
2021 was a fire year for the Sidemen 2022 gonna be even better
Press F to pay respects to these lads for all the hard work they’ve put in to entertain us, but also to those who thought that this would be a normal sidemen sunday video instead of a compilation.
The fact that the Sidemen didn't miss a single sunday shows how much dedication they have for the channel!
aight see ya guys next week ig...
WTF is this BS? Seriously.....
36 minutes 😭😭
The amount of laughs these  lot brought us all year is insane !! Show love
14 million subscribers and still underrated. Top 3 channels the past year. Carried the YouTube game during Covid times. Goated.
L
Harry is the funniest facts
Only 36mins :(
10:21 might be the best moment😂
I hope no one will complain even though that's pretty much impossible.
Might be a compilation but we get to relive a lot of good moments! Thanks for an awesome year Sidemen
“i waited a whole week for this” 🤓🤓🤓
wouldnt mind a montage after every sunday they gave us such a great videos to watch and good contents..they deserve break and wouldnt survive this year without sidemen sundays... love to u guys
For anyone that's going to complain just click off cause the Sidemen have worked so hard this past year. Let's take a moment to thank them for bringing us amazing content! 👏🏻
😐
2021 was the sidemens year no cap
1094 comment
Ah yes...I get Harry's tweet now...
🐐
Best group of dudes in the entire YouTube world no cap
sidmeen have worked hard last year, our Bois deserve a break !!
We need to appreciate everything the sidemen have done
1:46 behz copying reevs joke
L video
When is Big Fat Quiz 2021
What a great year for our boys!
ffs
I'd argue 3:05 is the most iconic moment of 2021
gday
We waited a whole week for a compilation video. That too 35 mins.
Disappointed
they have scuffed the secnd upload of the year but leave
is this the sidemen sunday?🤨🥴
This is so good thx sideman for making this year better
For the ones who are not satisfied, they are humans not robots and they need resting just like everyone else does, be grateful!
Me going thru a breakup waiting for entertainment to slightly cheer me up: Sidemen:
Ffs another comp
Remember them all
W for the sidemen and for the whole crew for entertainment
As if harry is in litterly all the clips is mad
Good year boy's
The dedication they put to this channel is crazyyy
First here 🙋‍♂️
👏👏👏👏
Harry tweet baited us
I wanna speak for all sidemen fans, we don't care that it's a compilation. Those who complain about it are being entitled and are not true sidemen fans. They deserve a break. They have not missed a Sunday uploading for 3 nearly 4 years, they need a break every now and then. Cheers to the boys and looking forward to a great 2022
I appreciate all the videos they have made but a complication? 😢 Let’s hope there will be a new Sidemen Sunday
Fugcough we deserve better Boggo done a violation Wtf is this Sidemen Sunday
They should bring drunk bingo back!
Best content creators 2021
Ah yes as soon as I saw Harrys tweet , i knew it
Bullshit
Atleast we are getting hide n seek next week
sidemen is a walking W rn
They deserve a break , <3
So Harry wasn’t lying about this video taking a year to make
It’s great but would have preferred an actual vid but we take what we can and celebrate how far the boys have come last year! 😁
This is doesn't count as new video so u miss a Sunday already in 2022🤷‍♂️
best youtube group in history
Ayo sidemen making easy money
Notice how Harry is litteraly the main man in almost all of these
First
It may not be a proper sidemen sunday but we can now watch the best moments from 2021 which made us laugh Looking forward to content coming up in the coming weeks and months
Everyone is like “this ones going to be crazy” Sidemen “It’s a compilation”.
When the sidemen decide to split they should do a video like this but of “all time” and they just sit and react to it. Would be so wholesome 😭😭😭😭
Can already see the "wTf I wAiTeD aLl WeEk FoR tHiS??" comments
Lets just appreciate everything they did to make us laugh for a moment
They bamboozled us not releasing it last week. Honestly thought I wouldn't have to watch one of these again.
This break for the sidemen is incredibly deserved🙏🏽 thanks boys for the epic year of content
If anyone complains that today’s Sidemen Sunday is a compilation, they literally said it would be on Side+ a while ago and obviously it would be. People complain so damn much and the boys work so hard. We don’t deserve them.
Ok but now I need a list of what videos these clips are from 😭😭
I understand why they do these compilations, I completely understand every now and then they need a break, still doesn't stop the disappointment tho 😂😭
Thanks, SIDEMEN for making yet another year of our miserable lives better...
Pain.
Yes it is a compilation, but let's just appreciate the effort they made during 2021. Well done lads👏
Do more hide and seek make this a chain
if I see anyone saying "this should've been on moresidemen, honestly they're getting lazy" I'm gonna drop kick them
Sidemen 20 mill in 2022!!
11k In 2 mins das crazy
Was kinda hoping for a Sidemen big fat quiz of 2021, last year was an absolute banger. But this will surely kick up some laughs too
There it is, the long awaited annual compilation 😂
Aye, 2021 wad a great year for sidemen content
Still waiting for the sidemen fifa 21 showdown despite fifa 22 being released
Unpopular opinion: SIDEMEN best moment completion videos are underrated
Anyone else waiting for Sidemen Mario Kart and Sidemen Drunk Bingo v2?
❤️
Stinker
2021 will go down as one of the best years for the Sidemen
i thougt it about 2 be a big vido not this
L SIDEMEN VIDEOS
2021 was a very trash year. Hopefully, 2022 is better
People hating on this vid sound ungrateful asf💀

U know what I'll take it
Ahhhhh

Harry baited me on twitter 😂
Montage for a sidemen sunday? Seriously?!
Well Harry didn't lie on twitter when he said "This video took a year to make".
Legends
Me is epic
don’t know what i would do if i didn’t watch the sidemen
They have made 2021 the best year for me
Not even mad, they deserve a break after the content they dropped throughout last year❤
'wE WaITed aLL weEK foR A 30 MinUTe COmpiLaTioN'
I will be the first to say, this is a disappointment and my week is ruined. No my year is ruined. No my life is ruined. A compilation‼️‼️
Here we goo 2022 with our sidemen.!
Robbed
I’d love to see how many dislikes this has 😂
People who expected anything else -> 🤡 Lads deserve a break!
I won't watch this but enjoy the break guys! Very deserved
wow they really werent lying that this video took a year to make😩
um yeah
took 1 Year for  a compilation btw
lets appreciate all they did
I know we'd all rather have a normal sidemen Sunday and not a compilation, but the boys deserve a break after making videos nonstop for the entirety of 2021.
Heres to a better 2022!
Come on man
We knew this video was coming but honestly they deserve a break
I bet they expected us not to love a compilation
BRUH THEY HIT US WITH THE INFAMOUS COMPILATION VIDEO, 👁👄👁
They wanted some free time to enjoy Christmas and New year hence they took a break , it was well deserved and a compilation closes the 2021 chapter well .
Bruh they really hit us with a compilation when we were fuckin waiting eagerly for the new sidemen sunday, what a bummer
Hello, my friends!!

Don’t wanna be rude but…  I’m disappointed  NOT angry  Just disappointed
Hopefully we get a sidemen tinder soon . Last year was full of bangers💃💃💃

Disappointing sidemen sunday tbh
They be scrapping

Sidemen are underrated
Sidemen have been on top of there game this year! Hopes to a good year for the sidemen and everyone else

This should be on MoreSidemen. I was hoping for an actual video today.
SPAM DISLIKE
