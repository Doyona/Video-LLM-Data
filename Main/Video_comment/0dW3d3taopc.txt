And ramsdale is going looking for his "clean shi "clean sheet" LMAO
Sewa sewa
Come on arsenal
What a game for Arsenal … they come back to the old team..it’s going to be interesting with a new player in most prime league team…
Oiiii
Respect to Jesus man. He fits into Arsenal than Man City. He is all Arsenal ever needed last season lol
I love how the Arsenal fans applauded Saliba after his own goal ❤
As an arsenal fan Its hard to get excited for the season because every year we have an amazing run followed by championship level performances in the other half of the season.
Great weekend it was for Arsenal with Liverpool, Chelsea, Tottenham and Man United dropping points and all.
16:20 🤣🤣🤣🤣 he like “wtf was that?!”
Danny Ward poor poor keeper. have no idea how he’s a starting keeper in the PL
Seeing Granit Xhaka happy makes me happy
Gunnerzzz are back!!!
Arsenal
Will Gunners stop jumping on Jesus's back? Need to keep those legs off injuries.  Vardy dived.
Somebody tell rodgers this 5-3-1-1 aint it dude. The team can’t defend or attack well with it. As for Arsenal, they are playing really well, but a lot of you guys are getting carried away... we’re only two games in. I still think spurs and chelsea have the edge over them in the long run, assuming chelsea get some reinforcements before the window shuts. Regardless, the future is bright for arsenal
Arsenal is playing good
Jesus a beast
So happy for Gabby J. Loved every second of him at City and miss him dearly. Always thought his level would sky rocket with consistent games, trust, and a good system for him. Genuinely believe his skill ceiling is near limitless.   So happy he and Zinny are fitting in at Artetas tricky gunners.
I hate Arbys
I simply wish the referees and commentators were consistent with their penalty analysis. If Vardy's wasn't a pen, then in no planet should last week's should have been against Liverpool.
I hope Arsenal keep this up. They’ve got a fine squad indeed!
Good to see Gabriel and Zinchenco shining at arsenal under Arteta! They will be missed at city. Hopefully we don't regret letting them go 😬
Arsenal is playing beautiful football. They will probably be in top four.
Can’t wait for Tottenham to play Arsenal so all the Arsenal fans can see how there team really isn’t that great.
Lol everybody that scored has a name that starts with 'G'.
Are the announcers Arsenal fans? They definitely seemed to have a soft spot for them
Brazil finna be a problem this year
He was nothing at city but he is about to be a legend at Arsenal. JESUS!
If the Gunners can stay healthy, the season looks very promising COYG!
I don't like the Vardy foul call when just looking slow motion and close-up. It looks like just a touch and played up. But when you watch it in real time, it's so fast and just a touch is all that is needed to knock him off balance. Though I would guess that Vardy did embellish it, I'd still call it an appropriate foul. I'm disappointed that VAR got another one wrong IMO.
Why on earth did Schmeichel leave Leicester?
Gabriel Jesus has been a godsend for Arsenal so far. 💪
Maddison is too good for this leicester team
So glad Jesus and Zinchenko are doing well
Congrats to Gabriel! You are now an Arsenal legend!
i haven’t seen an arsenal player score like jesus since Sanchez 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
Thank you Arsenal
Cool how Arsenal fans supported saliba after his mistake
Bruh martineli was cooking fofana 🤣🤣
Arsenal is back
Brazil 🇧🇷 only breeds winners 🥇🏆🏅🎖🥇
these arsenal players have come a long way. not a supporter of the club but those kids deserve success
Now I understand why my grandma said that Jesus is everywhere
Arsenal is basically a silver team version of Man city
this season top 4 for Arsenal is for sure let’s go gunners
As a City fan, I'm both proud of Arteta and scared.
It's really great to see G. Jesus blossom. He's always been good, but it's nice to see him freed of the rigid City system. He's going to be a revelation (no pun intended)
Arsenal lookin’ dangerous. The young talent look motivated & ready
when you see 20 minutes in highlights you know its gonna be good my days off catching up grubbing and smoking what a great life good stuff arsenal
These are such lousy highlights...Arsenal carved out way more chances than this and why did they not start with Martinelli winning the ball back for the fourth Arsenal goal?   Good win for Arsenal. Jesus making a difference, Saliba despite the mistake is a rock and Granit Xhaka also very good today.
Gabriel Jesus was the ammunition the Gunner's needed... The Gunners were firing a lot of blanks in the beginning of last season... This year looks like the opposite... Gabriel Jesus has given them a confidence and swagger they were missing...
Arsenal, Chelsea, Man utd, Tottenham are fighting for top 3 and 4 spots. Arsenal are looking good, Chelsea not so bad and same goes to Tottenham. Man utd is Man utd.
arsenal will still finish 7th probably
I love watching the Premier League. I always support different teams based on the Brazilian players on the squad. I used to watch a lot of Everton games because of Richarlison, Man City because of Jesus, Robinho, and Ederson. Chelsea when they had Oscar.  Leeds last season because of Raphinha. Liverpool because of Firmino, Fabinho, Allison, and Coutinho... And this Arsenal is so far my favorite team to watch every weekend. I love the atmosphere of the Emirates and how the team is playing as a team, lovely to watch. I hope this season they get the top 4. By the way, this new Arsenal jersey is beautiful, and I will get one soon. I hope one day I can go to an Arsenal game in London.
Watched this on Youtube on TV. @NBCSports - what's with the excessive adverts? 6 in total for about a 12-16 minute clip, 2 before kickoff... This is really turning me off watching Premier League Highlights through NBC
I gotta say, as a Man United fan this Arsenal team is real exciting to watch. Wish nothing but that the best for them.🙏
G.jesus is amazing 🤣
Proof that Xhaka just needed the right players along side his game to create dynamic value
What a goal by Gabriel Jesus
This is a season where things feels are really starting to change in the dynamics between teams
The invincibles R BACK!!!
This season looks good for arsenal all the best.
Glad I can root for Gabriel Jesus again! Now that he doesn’t play for god forsaken man city 👍🏻 GREAT pickup for arsenal
Hahaha that diving prick.
I am going to change my name to Gabriel and join Arsenal
16:20 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Danny ward is not the man that should be starting for Leicester
Best game so far
Jesus would miss 1v1 at City and chips it over keeper hahaha I’m glad he doing good
Arsenal ❤️❤️❤️
Gabriel Jesus likely the Premier League signing of the season
Arsenal took years insisting in expensive and uneffective overrated french players, now they have a Brazilian backbone of top players ready to take this team to the top level.
As a Chelsea fan I’m disappointed with our coach’s recruitment and selection of players. Last year we could have bought haaland for 140 million instead he opted to spend 120 million on lukaka. This year we could have got Jesus and sterling for around 100 million which is a freaking bargain but he said no Jesus doesn’t fit his play style. Oh so an under sized sterling whose never player ST does. Could have got de light along with koulibaly but said no de light don’t match his type of CB but cucerlla and fofana at CB does FOH.
leicester is just bad defending against set pieces,
Champion this season for Arsenal please!!!
Glad to see Arsenal doing good. Hopefully they can keep this going. Gabriel Jesus is a ball magnet 🔥
Well done to the Arsenal lads, keep moving forward!
G.Jesus is so underrated
I think Jesus is gonna be a revelation for Arsenal. And just to be clear, by Jesus I mean Christ. I know nothing about football.
This is the first season in some time that I have no interest in newly promoted teams. I'm still enjoying watching Brentford though. And no one, not even Man City supporters, can objectively deny that Zinny & Jesus belong at Arsenal. I for one will be keeping an eye on you, Mikel Arteta.   It's going to be another great EPL season.
the chemistry in the team is amazing especially with the new signings. Im glad arteta was kept as manager because the team is finally looking good
man, ill admit i doubted the jesus signing but now i see i was wrong
If ESR could find himself in the positions Ødegaard finds himself in and around opponents box, he'd definitely deliver up to 18 league goals
COYG
Boy, Arsenal are so fun to watch again. Reminds of the old Wenger Arsenal I used to love watching. Great one touch passing plays and Jesus has been a brilliant addition.
Jesus Christ loves you all
"Offside" had to be the man of the match.
Sooo much potential in this young arsenal squad
GoalKeeper Stinks lmao
They all look so happy, I see Arsenal finding their spot this season in champions league. 🙏🏿⚽️❤️
Arsenal might be a team to watch for this season. Skill v skill Pepe is naturally better than saka. I just don’t understand how he lets saka beat him in the pecking order🤷🏾‍♂️
Jesus’ first goals gave me faint Ronaldinho vibes.
I love the team that Arteta is building! So much young talent!
Zinchenko is really good going forward but tierney is more defensive. Both are really good. I do want to see cedric or tomiyasu. Cedric has more pace than Ben white and tomiyasu is more physical
Partet gave away to many balls. Saka was a bit slow. Ben white was getting exposed. Next game start elneny and tomiyasu. I’ll give saka another 60 minutes but maybe Pepe or smith Rowe can put pressure on saka
Jesus took zero time to be so deadly in the Arsenal side.
Football is starting. Football is also starting. Basketball is coming. Baseball playoffs are coming.  Most wonderful time of the year.
Whats wrong with your ads .. its just stupid we can't watch the highlights because of toooooooooooo many repeated ads  yukkk..
When will Arsenal play with top team I miss AFTV madness
The project is going Bang!
Powerful Attacking by Arsenal. And James Maddison should Transfer to Newcastle Utd as soon as possible!
G.J🇧🇷#9 (2 Goal's)(2 assist)Men of the match with out a dought.....
I’m back to being arsenal fan thank you Jesus
WHAT DO WE THINK OF TOTTENHAM?
ARSENAL!
Arsenal look so so promising. Props to the ref for catching vardy who has been a world class diver for awhile now.
I love Jesoos men is great
This match could easily be a 6 or 7 goal against Leicester.
The commentators big hating on Gabriel Jesus 😂 scallywags
Arsenal could finish 2nd. Very confident squad right now
Kasper is missed
Respect to our fans for encouraging Saliba after his mistake, showing him this type of love will only make him more confident and will hopefully help us be able to extend his contract👏👏
That first jesús goal gave me Alexis Sanchez flashbacks
Watching Gabriel Jesus prosper at Arsenal is such a bittersweet feeling 😵‍💫
The Arsenal are back!
Looks like a different arsenal. 👏
This season top 9
VAR is destroying the game.
Last season when rumors of Gabriel Jesus leaving Manchester city I did feel he was going to join Arsenal. Man his a beast I hope they win something this season Arsenal is playing amazing football
G Jesus is giving me Alexis Sanchez vibes
This season will go down in history ! We already having winter World Cup
The Jesus has risen!
Gabriel on fire 🔥
This shows that a system like tiki taka can hold a team back. Jesus could of been much greater for city.
Jesus and Martinelli Im excited for this season.
We are definitely back in business!   COYG!
this is how you do a rebuild. manchester united take notes
My gunners looking like title contenders 👀👀
If the gunners tighten up on defense, they have a real shot at the top. "Offense wins games, defense wins championships." (as the saying goes)
Both of the team they perform very well thanks for showing us a nice football ⚽
That was not a Penalty
Thank you Pep and City for giving us Jesus and Zinchenko
Well. Looks like Leicester City has hit the end of it's run. I foresee a relegation battle this year. And after that league title back in 2015 I thought that maybe they'd be the brand new team to crack into the top 6 mega club category and maybe bump Tottenham or Arsenal out. But after their failures to build a bigger and better squad since that title year... It's obvious they're just going to keep dropping. :(
Everyone is talking about Saliba keeping his head in the game but honestly so did Ward. When you're being put under that much pressure for ninety minutes, you're bound to make at least one mistake. But that ball to Maddison afterward to basically fashion a chance out of nothing was exquisite.
Sloppy but valid win
Everybody wearing the same boots😭😭
This gunners team is not to be mess with the firepower they have is scary but their big test is Liverpool at anifeld
Ramsdale leaks goals through his legs constantly.  Arsenal should start Matt Turner.
17:28 this is a unmissable gol. All He had to do Was to control with his left and smash with his right at an empty gol 🥅
I think the J in Jesus is pronounced as an H. You guys need to get out more.
Would love for arsenal to win the premiere league this season.  Nothing is impossible,  Lester won it so why should I think any different
Arsenal pls pull thru this year
What a game
It's a brilliant start to a new season...folks watch out Arsenal is evolving and shining ✨️ 😀 👌 🙌 😎 1⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️
18:53 What is this commentator getting paid for 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I’m so happy that that traitor Jesus didn’t get a hat trick
I was watching this game way more than our game
Rebecca can get it
Sleeping on arsenal this year will be a mistake
Thomas Partey was bang average today! He gave the ball away so much!
Leicester set piece woes continue.
city fan here, and im sooo impressed with this years arsenal
Still not convinced Xhaka is Arsenal material
What am I watching!?! Arsenal getting VAR calls in favor!?! 👀👀   If the refs don’t fu#* us this year then we will def be in the top 4!
The inconsistency tt EPL ref shows is just astounding. Vardy got a clear pen. But was overruled by VAR. Whereas Mitrovic got his at Fulham evethou he dived and no VAR review was done.
NBC trash...wants you go buy there trash programming and then puts so much commercials...
suddenly arsenal are fun to watch!
as a city fan, im so happy jesus and zinchenko are getting to play in a system that lets them show their potential.
Jesus has been amazing so far. I wonder if he can keep that kind of consistency.
I still can’t believe Leicester city let Kasper Schmeichel leave.
Can you believe that when how much Martinelli and Jesus scored in just two games of this season combined already equals how much Lacazette scored in the last entire season? And the latter trol just whined that he wants to play for a club participating in the UCL with such a shameless record of 4 goals in the entire season? Jesus and Martinelli are already showing us how the team can function greatly. When they can show this against Liverpool, Man City, Tottenham, and Chelsea, Arsenal can secure at least 3rd in the league this season.
Job well for Gabriel Jesus 👏 for win for arsenal ❤
North London Derby should be a fiery match this season. Both teams look incredibly sharp.
Very good refereeing this time Vardy didn't get away with his usual simulations, desappointed that he didn't get a yellow.
GJ goal was professional
The arsenal fans supporting saliba was incredible...also martinelli is on fire
The irish guy was right about Leicester needing Dubravka
Jesus is so underated man. Two goals two asist . Dude could've scored five goals today. I'm calling it now, he will score 32 goals and qualify for the championship league. Book it boys and girls 😂
Arsenal could have won 6-2 of Jesus was more focused on a win, rather than a hat trick
i’m really missing kasper rn
Tielemans come to Arsenal
William Saliba is pure class. Big up man like Martinelli & yute like Jesus
being a city fan, i miss Jesus and Sterling, but also I'm afraid that winning this year won't be easier now. 💙
SO Badly missed the prem league!! these longer  clips are AMAZING. I pay for that one big game  but getting to watch the rest on youtube is amazing
Best Arsenal buy...Jesus
As a Gooner As a football purist I kindly in the name of brotherly love Suggest we Arsenal donate Elneny, Holding and Pepe to man Utd  We fire !!
Why did vardy not get yellow for simulation?
This is the first time in years I've genuinely had hope for Arsenal. Arteta finally looks like the Pep apprentice he was marketed to us as, the squad is who he wants, the link up play looks like City, and holy crap it's fun to watch
At 13:20 you can’t even hear the commentary the crowd is so loud
Arsenal all day mate, we are coming. Let's go Coyg!
Man City and Arsenal atop the league 2 games in as the 2 clear best teams so far. Man U in dead last. Take a picture of the table now cause things prob won't last this way
I’m ready for g.Jesus to get potm on fifa 🤷🏻‍♂️
Jesus is fitting in seamlessly, what a signing. The race for the top 4 is going to be spectacular this season.
Yes, yes!!!!! Finally, my Arsenal is looking good. And by the way, it's common sense that you NEVER return the ball on net to your goalie, in case for whatever reason he can't get to it, the ball doesn't go in. It's honestly ridiculous how many people we see continuing to fail in this basic play.
Arsenal:awesome,ready,super,energy,no,amazing,and loving
Ramsdale should have done a lot better for Leicesters second goal.
Vardy vexxxxxx😂😂😭
Don't fret" that sound jamaican
Where's Lacazette? Also football announcers need to put more importance on Assists. No mention of Jesus' 2 assists.
Arsenal is Man City's small brother
Vardy shoulda got yellow for simulation.
I’m in love with Arsenal again❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️!!!!!!!
Arsenal making the top 4 this year
Ggs gunners next match we want revenge
Once they beat Chelsea, Man U, Man City, Liverpool and Totenham than I will take them seriously. They start well against mid or low teams but against those teams they struggle. Well we'll see if they can beat Man City and Liverpool because Man U and Chelsea aren't the same this season but they still give Arsenal problems. Totenham knows Arsenal well but it's still winnable. I still feel they have to get over these teams to consider Arsenal a threat
Leicester got a little unlucky to not tie things up before the Martinelli gem of a goal, but also could have easily gave away 8 goals today. The back 5 is just not working. I'd rather have a second CDM next to Ndidi than have Amartey giving chances to the other team all game like at 9:23.
Arsenal.   Arsenal. Arsenal
6 Goals in the Match ... Arsenal scored 5 of them!
COYG
Watching All or Nothing with this makes every win seem even more important. Jesus adds so much to this team and a real attacking threat that is just what we need to really solidify a top four spot again. Great performance!
As a spurs fan, arsenal look scary dude😭
The fans clapping for Saliba after the own goal said it all for me, the fans are behind this group. Great win, the score line could’ve been much higher. COYG!
👍
As a Chelsea supporter I’m so upset we didn’t attempt to sign Jesus. 😭 he’s gonna be world class for arsenal!
all scoring no defending. classic arsenal game at the emirates XD
not gonna lie arsenal are dark horses in the premier league this season , the way they’ve reinforced and the way they’re all clicking as if they’ve been playing together for years is impressive and menacing
The one announcer, please get someone else. Who says Jaka?
Gabriel Jesus was a great investment for Arsenal this season. What a spectacular goal.
This might be one of the best Premiere league season of all time 👍
London is and will always be RED 💯🍺
Arsenal goal keeper needs to pay attention to the ball. He comes out too much 🤣
Just happy to see ESR, Tierney, and Tomiyasu getting back on the field. The team is finally getting all together
Before the season I called that Jesus will have a memorable season potentially top scorer
May god keep blessing arsenal 😭😭❤️🙏🙏🙏🙏
Am still waiting to see 7 games ,and playing against man city, Liverpool, spurs......
Is Xhaka a box to box player now?
Rams owner doing arsenal good recently, they look lively these past 2 games
I think G. Jesus has found his spot in EPL. Massively suits for Arsenal. Great FW.
Man United is falling apart. wow
This game epitomized what Arteta preaches in All or Nothing: when your teammate makes a mistake it’s up to the rest of the team to pick them up. Saliba mistake, Xhaka goal. Ramsdale mistake, Martinelli goal. Very happy with the club.
How is not the foul on Vardy is not a PK?
Jesus 🔥
Not my team but these gunners gonna be fun to watch this season. And I hope GJ destroys MC.  Why did farciola get rid of him is incomprehensible.
I feel like ramsdale was too far out for the saliba own goal, if saliba is right next to vardy he don’t need help. Stay on your line.
Gabi missed 3 goals scored 2 goals, great but those missed I really needed them, but Brazilian only scored, who would be next for Arsenal
Gabby. Good lord
Se o Jesus não for titular na copa eu nunc amais assisto o Brasil, oq ele tá jogando e brincadeira
Gabriel FC 🇧🇷
Zinchencko clearly out of position on the second goal why he up so high and leave the player behind him horrible defending by zinchencko  this should have been a clean sheet again for arsenal
the subs really highlight the depth Arsenal has this year which has been lacking in recent seasons.
16:22 🤣🤣
Ramsdale to blame for that own goal is positioning is horrible smh why is he coming of is line in that situation ramsdale been horrible these first 2 games a little bit to over confident and making silly mistakes !!!!
I love Martinelli He is reminding me so much of a young kaka.
Happy Weekend  everyone
We’re back baby ❤️
Come on Fofana come to the big blues already
G.Jesus is hard worker
Jesus had 5 to 6 chances.
So uh Leicester need a new goalkeeper…
Jesus's first goal is Brazilian magic, a classic futsal goal.
Jesus's positioning is excellent.
Would love a Arsenal-City race
This is the longest highlights I’ve seen lol COYG!
Arsenal looks dangerous… I’ve been a fan of Jesus since he was a backup for Aguero. I wonder if they’ll make the top 4 this season. I definitely don’t believe they’ll beat Chelsea, Man City, and Liverpool out though.
Let’s go Arsenal!
Wo!  What a magnificent Man City victory!  Many are extremely concerned that the practically "indomitable" MAN CITY have transformed or are gradually transforming the ENGLISH PREMIER LEAGUE into a "FARMER LEAGUE" like the Dutch (German) League and/or La Liga (the French League) that is/are dominated by mighty BAYRN MUNICH and the "invincible" PARIS ST. GERMAN (PSG), respectively.
Love how Xhaka celebrate the goal, after what happened between him and the fan. I'm glad he is still a gunner and he had really good game today as well.
It looks like Guardiola was destroying Jesus's career by benching him too often at City! when you bench a player too often, you take his freedom , you devalue his quality, you make him lose his confidence! Jesus and Sterling did well to leave City and find a team they can have more play time!
not an arsenal fan but i like what this team is doing. Jesus gotta be the smartest signing of this summer. perfect fit
Fire Brandon he obviously doesn’t know what he is doing! How do u keep not start kelechi when everytime he comes on the pitch he makes things happen with a goal or an assist! Kelechi plz leave this management
@16:23 Martinelli: Oww! That hurt
Good team deserves good win. Those guys looked hungry for goal. I think we gotten a team that could secure top 4.
Can’t wait for Christian Romero to absolutely pocket Jesus
What a time to be an Arsenal supporter COYG
Gabby Jesus is becoming a PROBLEM. He's just entering his prime too, Arsenal got a true talent on their hands!! 💯‼️
Pep sold Eto'O when he was a Barca and that was a huge mistake, Now, he done it again with Jesus.
Gabriel Jesus is really good. Unfortunately, when he was at City, Raheem Sterling got in his way too much and took the goals and the spotlight.
We’re talking about buying tielemanns maybe we should look at ndidi
We won but our defense should be more alert. They have a lot more potential, some chances Leicester got we should not have given them.
I feel like ndidi would thrive on arsenal
11:10 So there's a difference between simulation and trying to draw a foul like you would in Basketball?
Thank u
Arsenal looks great this season, probably will be in top 4
Arsenal is solid team and will compete in top 4 spot this season.
12:06 French people aren't black
I hope arsenal pay his phone bill when he is finished making all those calls because it seems like he is gonna make alot this season and beyond,  oh Damm also Eddie Bill 🤣
Spurs fan here, but what a great game. Jesus was a fantastic signing.
Saliba really kept his cool after that mistake i respect it👍🏼
Jesus looks really happy. He was begging for Pep to let him go so he can play full time. Luckily Haaland  didn't cost 100M like Grealish
🔥they looked serious this year I think they need 2 more players a CB and A RB
12:33 don't ever do that again
"Ward is ready"
I’m scared to watch man United highlights, I missed the game. And it’s not looking good.
That was a Reality Check for Saliba 😅 honestly so far only him can score against himself 😂
oh my if arsenal defesnse gets more solid, we might b watching arsenal as a serious title  condender.
Arsenal needs another CDM to get top 4
I will miss Jesus in City!
Arsenal actually feel like a top 4 club this season! Thank you football Gods
Arsenal making me scared right now
Vardy so good.... at acting. Almost an Oscar for the flop. If that was not a PK, then he should get a card for simulation.
that could have been 6-2
Arsenal top 4?
Vardy assisting Jesus was amazing,
James Maddison needs to be in that World Cup team
8:17 and that is why Ndidi is one of the best defensive midfielders in the game today! The awareness and tackle 😍
I worry bout our goalkeeper Leno gone n he got not competition with no one the second goal is a disaster but look his positioning guys he could kick our gather that Saliba header 💀
Jesus stop sticking your thumb in your mouth. There are germs flying all over the place out there.
Both goalkeepers are bang average!
Goal Timestamps:   23'- G. Jesus: 4:45  35'- G. Jesus: 6:43  53'- W. Saliba: 11:52  55'- G. Xhaka: 13:00  74'- J. Maddison: 14:53  75'- G. Martinelli: 15:57
3:37 Thats a great save by Ramsdale! That cross is going straight to Timeberlake, also happy VAR actually looked at the pen replay, very good decision.
What a goal by Jesus!! I am supper happy that we got 6 points out of 6, a real pleasure to watch the team, its entertaining and fun again, i enjoy the football again, ✊COYG🔴🔴🔴🔴
Gabriel Jesus has been amazing for Arsenal. He's merged quickly into this Arsenal side, playing magnificently. Arsenal, by the looks of it, have a good season ahead of them.
When was the last time we scored 5 goals 👍
Madison is good
Ad every 10 seconds what are they doing to youtube
Could have easily been 6-2. Jesus alone had at least near misses!
Love this squad ! ❤️
Second game of the season…and Arsenal fans are ready to buy next year’s UCL tix.😂  You ain’t that good.
☝️☝️☝️☝️
why is kelechi iheanacho still on the bench
I love this squad so much. They really fighting for each other.
Wtf xkaka arc at arsenal has been a crazy story. I have a feeling that arsenal will hire him after he retires
Gabriel Jesus really showing Pep that they didn’t need to look for anyone “better”, he’s pure class at any club he goes to
Wow! Awesome to see the ref +  VAR do the right thing on the Ramsdale/Vardy contact.
How many times should I watch the advertisement?????
Did arsenal really get a good striker again? Before auba and after van persie we had a curse at the 9 lmao
The chemistry and youth of this Arsenal squad is crazy. Top four finish this year and if they improve even further then they'll definitely compete with City and Liverpool next season.
Ramsdale is getting a bit eccentric and loosing control. He is no 1 but he needs to be less rash.
Congratulations Arsenal, 22/23 Premier League Champions
Arsenal W man u in the mud. What a day
Nice big game winner goals for Arsenal to win the game against Leicester City 😊😊😀😃😃😄😄😳😳😳😳😁😁😁😁😁😁☺☺☺☺😺😺😺😺😺😹😹😹😹😮😮😮😮😊😊😊😊😀😀😃😄😄😳😳😳😳
Go Foxes!!!
Vamos!
Honestly we would get top 4. But there is a problem if Jesus gets injured that bad, Nketiah is there but not good enough.
Arsenal are cooking. Lfg COYG!!!
You can still see how Saliba is solid even after the miscommunication mistake . What a gem .
Keep it going Arsenal. As for Manchester Utd they need a major overhaul.
Guuuuuuners!!!😊🤙
As a Chelsea fan, I can’t lie I’m intimidated of Gabriel Jesus.
Another big win today against an always tough Leicester side. This squad is really something special.
Can't Rebecca do something with her hair?
Jesus!! What a guy
Coyg 💪
jesus what an underrated player showing his true potential
So, all what Jesus needed was more play time. He is definitely a gain for the Gunners. Always liked the guy. LFC fan here.
Arsenal is back. 😁
Lei city goalie is terrible 🤣
Hi
Came to support our former City blues
Good game overall. Some hard time for the defense line and the gk, but good attack.
I love this team so much!!
Can’t wait until we face a big team and than go on a 10 game losing streak.
Not the best game for ramsdell but well done arsenal!!!!! This is our year!!!!
Good Game
Matthew chapter 4 verse 12:And Jesus called unto Vardys name and told him to not touch the ball. But vardy disobeyed, he sinned against the lord Jesus. And verily verily I say unto you when the corner was taken vardy touched the ball it allowed Jesus to score easily.
Great days to be an Arsenal fan👏 Zinchenko is gonna be class for us
Arsenal is back,I can't wait to see Man UTD vs Arsenal 🤣🔥🔥🔥🔥
I’ve seen that Vardy flick on for Jesus’ 2nd goal numerous times. Maybe don’t put him on the front post 😂
COYG!!!!!!!
Wonderful assist, Vardy --> Gabriel Jesus.
yes
I’m so impressed by my team 🙂
Ze beautiful game
I wish the season could finish now and Arsenal is PL champion!
Too many commercials
Where is Soyuncu???
Jesus>>Harlaand. My opinion..
Jesus is the best forward we’ve had since Sanchez what a baller 🔥
It was obvious gabriel Jesus was our best attacker too many people overhyping our youngsters they are improving but still a level below
Lets gooo
Saliba is staying the full season right ? He’s to good to be sent on loan again
This could have easily been 7 or 8 for Arsenal. Really impressive creation
Alexis Sanchez welcome back
Jesus will go far. Trust me.
If jesus keep playing like that. He definitely have a place in brazil for wc 2022.
Arsenal looking good so far
Xhaka had a really good game. Criticize him when it’s justified, no doubt. But you also have to praise him when he deserves it. Goal + assist
Jesus could genuinely win the golden boot
looks like arsenal might end up getting top 4 this season lol
Please can we not have Rebecca she’s really annoying
We’re winning the Europa league and getting top 3 this season 🤞
Leicester really needs a goalie
I love how the Arsenal Fans applauded Saliba when he scored an own knowinng that if that ball goes beyond him to Vardy it is a goal, best fans in the PL
Jesus should have had that hat trick…
COYG! Would have love a clean sheet but the boys are playing with passion and hunger. Keep it up 💪🏼
I’m so glad we got Jesus, he’s the type of striker we’ve been missing . I also love how we responded immediately after conceding on 2 occasions. We look really good going forward 🔥
COME ON YOU GUNNERS LETS GO!!! 🔥
Man u lol
Please return Jesus now y’all had y’all fun 😢
G Jesus = Shades of Bergkamp vs Leicester 😎
Dont get carried by how much we start remember emery went 20+ without a loss and went south after that and fans become WILD! 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Arsenal went after Gabriel Jesus while Tuchel went after Aubameyang. Lol
Def always a pen
Arteta is cooking now🔥🔥🔥
These two Gabriels are playing extraordinarily this season. Looks like Arsenal is going to be in the top 3. Awesome!
Can we sign Diaby and/ or Sandro Tonali before the window closes? We would then have incredible depth.
Good humbling moment for Saliba. Don’t want his head getting too big early in his career. Every player has a bad moment or too.
Martinelli getting goals earlier in the season now
Idk who is worse Nathan Ake or Zinchencko
Will be interesting to see how far arsenal’s defense will take them this year, they have plenty of offense
Leicester keeper gotta step it up 😑
i hate soccer
🔥JESUS AND MARTINELLI🔥 🇧🇷 What a duo!! 🇧🇷
jesus has risen in north london 🔴⚪️
Love the start of this season so far. Arsenal need to keep their confidence up in order to take control over games and win them. COYG!
Waited for like 30mins for y’all to upload. Thank you 🙏

Been waiting. COYG
