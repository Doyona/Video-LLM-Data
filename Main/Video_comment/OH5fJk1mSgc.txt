He's got that Walten Goggin charmm
I have a major crush on this guy after watching this lol
geeez, annoying talking... not watching that garbage...
This makes me want to visit NO again. Happy employees will always follow a leader like  Justin and do it with the same integrity .
Verti Marte is better. Just sayin
A sandwich whereby all the filling falls out is not my vibe.
Wow! What is there not to like about this guy? He is simply amazing! He knows every aspect of his business, inside and out ... cares about his employees ... has never ending energy and compassion ... and runs what looks like an incredibly successful business making signature New Orleans food. I could watch him explain the process all day!  By the way, do NOT watch this video if you are hungry!  LOL!  I hope I can visit the Parkway Bakery and Tavern someday!
VERTI MART. GO THERE BEST PO BOYS OF ALL>.  Upper Royal st
Why does he sound like dwayne the rock johnson
kinda built like hunter renfrow
Legend!
❤ Fantastic ❤.
just like that ? bread on the floor in paper bags ? no thank you
I like the owner very much, seems like a nice guy and cares about his business.
this is the America we like!
now im craving for these sandwiches 😭😭😭
Lotta older folks in that sandwich prep kitchen.
THIS GUY IM MY TYPE OF GM
It has been 30 years since I have been to NO  Will stop by when I come next time
Down to earth and real, beautiful on all sides! This honorable place is absolutely on my bucket list.
Been there countless times- It's now an addiction! LOL
Donated a kidney, BBQ Team for Charity, Worked and still works every station, Car Pool driven by himself, the GM, Local History know it all - man's an absolute legend and rare gem
It may seem a video about a sandwich, but it so represents, to me as an immigrant, the America that I have come to know, cherish, admire, and love. This is quintessential America and the general manager examplifies the best of America, smart, hardworking, caring, and successful. So refreshing amidst all the sound and fury of political turmoil and nonsense.
OUTSTANDING VIDEO
That beef sandwich looked like the best sandwich Ive ever seen
Dude immediately starts talking like a black guy when the bread shows up LOL
Mid boys since way back
I will never understand how americans consider these horror stories as inspiring. 72 and still working as a fry cook? You people have failed your elders
This guy is a rock star 😂
Why is is now days all people working in food preparation don't wear hair nets & washing their hands it's like the rules for working in food preparation and cleanliness don't apply here in this video I saw a few people wearing them and who and why people put mayonnaise on po boy sandwich, lettuce,  pickles,  tomatoes I think took much filler but I understand everyone prepares it differently depending on the region in the country
We have a business in Baton Rouge and we buy the same bread it’s not that special
Shrimp po boy!
Mouth watering !!
The beef juice served with a sandwich is NOT called "au jus"....it is simply "jus". The way the sandwich is served is "au jus" or "with juice"
Silence of the Hams FTW
I want a shrimp po boy
ah yes original og
Oh goshhh I need to go to Usa to get all this food!!!! NGL usa makes the best fatty food
WOOOOOw!😍​
WOOOOOw!
I'm coming to NOLA next year just to try this bad boy
That's what a shrimp poboy suppose to look like. I went to the fiery crab on the westbank and them mofos put 12 shrimp on it. 6 on each side. I thought that was a accident and went back a second time and 12 shrimp again.
I just ate not 30mins ago and im hungry. lol
The organization with the orders is incredible honestly
what a sad country, america doesn't care about its people
So there was a guy on the show frisky dingo named Mr Ford. I named my cat after that guy because I loved that dude so much. This is the real Mr Ford
All the food looks amazing, but the James Brown looks too much for me.
You’re an inspiration buddy, thank you for what you’re doing. Restores a bit of faith in this country.
Parkway is the real deal and makes -unbelievable- sandwiches.  I never go to NOLA without stopping there.  Video was so much fun, this is what cooking is all about!
Only state's I'm visiting if I'll go to the States is the southern swamp states, that's where the soul of USA still lives.
Thsnk you
Dude is literally on top of the business.
13:52 It barely registered 16 oz before he removed it
This is the second video in a row that I've seen that talks about Creole cooking but I don't see nobody black
I dont like the owner. He's exactly the type of charismatic slavedriver  to talk about the "family" of employees, then never offer raises and deny requests for time off.  How many employees talked to the camera? Now look at other Bon Appetite videos
This guy is legit, great business to have lunch at.
That 1 sandwich would keep me full for like 12 hours.
Bon Appétit? I thought this was the "Jennifer Garner talking about capitol one every 2 minutes" channel
73 and still working…. America went wrong. Worst country ever
This guy's charisma is off the charts
Does this character have a family?
Get that mayo outta here so disrespectful to the bbq sauce
The shrimp Po Boy at the Parkway is one of the best things I have ever eaten. Worth a trip to New Orleans.
This guy is a solid, decent human being. Big respect.
I went here a few months back got the fried oyster po boy and met this legend.
American eat jump food eve4y day that is not healthy
Yummie🎉
This whole episode was beautiful, the people, the process, the sevice level.
Looks great - would love to visit this place
No Brad?
I'm concerned about cross contamination since everybody is doing everything
He has systems down. That's the most important for volume
If I lived near this place, with that drive through I can see me at 300 pounds easy. My excuse to start would be with this video alone. I lost 2 pounds of saliva just watching it.
What a fabulous company and video......
Wednesday-Sunday 10-6 is a dream schedule for restaurant workers
Why is most Americans mansplaining? And talk like a Futbaalll?
Watched 2mins and was tired of this fake personality
This is guy is cool, his white thou could be black 😅
people dont look happy working there.
This guy is awesome.
こういうもんばっか食ってるから寿命短いんだよ笑 デブと麻薬中毒者とバカな大統領しかいない汚物みたいな国
There's something about watching food videos while having food.
If Forrest Gump had a cousin
This episode made me so hungry 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I'm pretty sure this was the first episode I ever saw of bon apetit...somehow I don't remember seeing the second half... must've went ordering some Po boys lol
This guy is legit
They look very tasty but ~$18 USD for one is insanity.
Make me some sandwiches....sir this is a strip club
bros drunk about half way in
This is awesome, so much history
I'll take a James Brown, please.
What's going on with those 70+ yo employees making sandwiches??? There's no retirement in New Orleans? That gives a third world twist on this otherwise very well interesting video.
Love love the restaurant industry.
I don't care for a  foot high sandwich that is impossible to eat.
seems yummy
Oh yeah!!! Bread lies directly on the  bed of the delivery truck!!!! Nice! HCCP rules!!
Nice❤
Used to close at 10pm, now they close at 6pm but make the same numbers.  Don't let the rest of this video fool you, nothing you see is about the passion. It's about making as much money as possible by limiting the working hours of your employees as much as possible while maximising order output.  Not touching this place with a 4 meter pole.
This is beautiful
1. Love what you do. 2.Have a great product,  3.Look after your people Golden wisdom, no doubt will be around for another 100 years.
The employees do not seem happy.
i dont know, but be proud of his crew working 10 to 12 hours a day ts creepy, slavery is over.
So cool! Putting this place on my bucket list! Love how he says that you need to take care of your people.
Your food is so delicious and attractive.
Cleanest dap known to mankind.. lol
shremp
I like this guy - need to visit the restaurant
He know his bread which is very important😋
It's not a joke.  The Creole Shrimp Po- boy ( I do the sauce on the side to walk to the bayou with) & a side of sweet pot fries! *mouthpop
“🎼James Brown …… James Brown …… James Brown …… James Brown🎼”
This video was so soothing and the sandwiches look amazing
I visited Nawlins in 2007, 2 years after Katrina and I never had a bad meal any where.  And the people are super friendly.
this would be such a great movie ngl
FFS
Great content, keep going
These are NOT Poor Boy Sandwiches ANYMORE dude
"Silence of the Hams" 😆
Is it just me or does Justin remind us of actor Matt Dillon 😁
Based on this guy's attitude and enthusiasm, I'd fly to NO just to give him my business.  And I close my eyes and hear Harry Connick Jr.
Silence of the hams 💀😆
What a great operation!  Thanks for sharing!  It's great to see how close you are to not only the business but the people throughout the whole process.
"Silence of the Hams" lmfao 😆
This OG deserves every success - what a hospitality superstar!!
workplaces would be such productive environments if most managers were like this guy instead we get to suffer under the bootstraps of bosses like Elon
Great video.
Dude blinked like 5 times in this whole video 😅
I feel bad for all imcels
This gentleman reminds me of my father as far as how he treated his employees in Newark. Company still going strong after his death.🙏🥂🥃
Bro got ick, after he dropped the mag 💀
A bakery that gets bread delivered..
Isn’t that pot roast?
Bless this guy’s soul !  ❤❤
They only use real Gulf shrimp... nothing foreign.
This guy can thicken his accent on demand.
If you ever go to New Orleans PLEASE GO HERE!
crazy that a single resturant makes new orleans a place to visit for me
The passion and the efficiency are both extraordinary.
How could you not have a smile on your face after watching this? Love everything about this guy - awesome stuff Bon Appetit!
Yeah, I'll take one of each.
This dude is a legend.
putting hot food in a cooler is criminal
im ready to quit my job as a corporate insolvency lawyer and hop on the line
i never respected anyone more
This was my first meal in New Orleans, found the place on accident and people were asking how I found the best place in the city without knowing about it
Sounds like Peyton Maning talking
This guy is giving me the creeps.
This guy was made for shows like this
next time i go to nola im gonna have to stop by!
I Love New Orleans. I was born  & raised across the river in Jefferson Parish , married & lived in Lafayette .Your wife's family makes The BEST poboys I've ever had 😋  ❤
I like this guy. He got that swag about him 😀
Probably give me a heart attack but it would be worth it lol.
LOVE AT THE PUREST❤🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
"NuOrlens"
They should be wearing hair nets. No one realizes that?   I built computers and now I do watercolor, I realize that hygiene is paramount in the food business, and I realize that I am not even in the food industry. What happened to common sense?
Reddy feruh bizzy day.
Idk how i feel about him wheeling around the meet outside
@18:25 I've heard the some NO chefs call it the Holly Trinity but then you also have garlic, The Pope.
I will see you soon! Cannot believe i lived in NO for 5 years and never heard of this place.
I think the expediter should get paid double then. They're doing 2 jobs.
Never even been there, still feel so proud of that team 🎉
🔥
Dude is the goat!
20:20 - MTV Cribz vibes
❤❤❤❤❤
The production of this was impressive!!!!
this guy is a natural for tv presentation
THIS PLACE LOOKS DANK!  The jambalaya and roast beef look divine.
Don’t get it wrong. This guy is happier than 99% of people watching this
Thick thick accent
LOL poor mans steak and lobster i felt that
Im convinced that Americans aren't capable of making a sandwich that isnt a complete mess. Looks delicious, but if its dripping all over the place its not enjoyable to eat
This guy is awesome!!! So badass how much he can accomplish and manage in a day. I got a little emotional seeing the passion and community this restaurant is filled with❤
Not going to cut it
Think I’m coming to New Orleans just got this food. Omg
❤❤❤
Love these videos!
Know what you want to order when you get to the window. Be part of the process. ☺️
I would fly to New Orleans just to eat here
I’m not a meat eater, but Justin wooed me into wanting to try everything on that incredible menu.  He is a charmer for sure!🥰
Those bar stools are concave
Coooollll dude Fursure 🫡🙏
U are a typical owner under paying his staff to make u ur MILLION plus a year - like straight up more chefs need to stop working for these fools
Looks like he's ready to argue about .25 an hour raise.
There are still some truly great people in this world.
One lucky woman !❤What a catch he is ! ❤
This place is most definitely on my list for when I visit the US in January 2025!
The portions are generous. The places in MN that have PO boys skimp on the filling.
When I lived in NOLA, my go to was a roast beef poboy, dressed, with debris. Flip it over so the debris soaks both sides. The outer crust holds it together, no sogginess
Liuzza on the track has a better poboy.  Better seasoning on the meat.  Parkway is where the tourists go. Still excellent.
This guy has the best life!
Not too many like him  around nowadays. Bravo!
What a guy. 👑
Deserved succes
Buddy talking like he own the place
1:20 clean dap ngl
When you love your job, it really shows
I have questions: Did his PoBoy beat his Wife's Family PoBoy in the competition?!
U need turkish garlicsausige called sucuk in your Menue❤❤❤❤
I like Justin and Ford’s little car chatter. I love Justin’s speaking style: accent, laid back, personality.
DROOLING.
NOTHING LIKE DOING WHAT YOU LOVE.
this guys got great energy
Dedication and passion to make it happen. Awesome...Love it !
Amazing journalism
Heard Isaac Toupes say the garlic is the Pope
I'm sooo hungry ! Aaaaaggghhhh !!!  I want some jambalaya and a catfish po-boy .
He needs to get his teeth fixed!! Help him out!!! How much he getting paid that he can’t get his teeth fixed working for u BIG GUY?
Are those shrimps cleaned out? Are y’all eat the digestive tract? Just wandering
They was in a rental truck delivering bread 🥖. Anyone see that? I just noticed that’s all. No harm 🙃
Love this guy’s energy
He needs his own show!
Food and music are wonderful  in NO. the rest of NO is a slum.
New Orleans inhabitants are so chilled I admire them. The two Martin brothers, Ben and Clovis, streetcar/tram employees, invented the poor boy sandwich in the 1920s.
very unhealthy fastfood.
Awesome manager. He knows respects his people and every aspect of the business. And willing to do any job when it's necessary.
The passion 🤌🏻
I am ready to fly miles to have a bite of their sandwich
Thats the restaurant where Elijah and Niklaus would eat if they werent a vampires..
i want a the office style show for this restaurant
thats the attitude
Also it looks like future bread pudding...
Respect
All looks amazing.  Need our mom and pop shops, no finer food ❤
I could watch this guy all day
What an operation! Everything looks fantastic!
why dont they simply toast this "bread/loaf" it would be a perfect crispy sandwich... :o
Yummy
Silence of the Hams,  Hogs for the Cause. 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Then why dont most of the restaurants there make them well??? Tried in many places, yours did the best!
So boring lol
I thought the Muffaletta was the most famous sandwich in NO
This is strength through empathy.
he sells people early death
This guy is truly incredible, such a professional, such attention to details, procedures. A clear mind, it was humanely refreshing to watch this.
You are a very smart  manager. It takes everyone to make a winning team.
One of the few big cities ive been to, despite the shady areas New Orleans is a really awesome place, especially if you like to eat food....
"I've worked every spot in this kitchen...".   Yep, that's what's up.
68802 Jade Plain
He so handsome, i dont know why
Please wear a hat or net!!!
Love this guys energy
This is the OG general manager.
🙌🏾 MAD RESPECT ❤
"If I had to cook a small portion I don't think I'd know how to do it... I gotta cook in bulk." I just love that.  lol
all that volume and not profitable business.
Best Video I have ever seen as. Professional line cook
This Guy is the definition of a Leader, He gave his own brother his Kidney that says it all, I hope he gets more successful
Thank you
Could listen to Justin talk about sandwiches all day long. He's got that real nola accent. Also, now i'm hungry. Imma holla atch yall lata!
I hate new orleens.
Visiting New Orleans? Prepare to eat the best food ever!😊
Dude is livin the dream and lovin it - and it shows. Big props to his passion.
The shrimp sandwich is the weirdest thing I have ever seen. 😅😅
Great recipe! Girls, only cook like this!
Daaam...I need a James Brown Sandwich now !!
been to just about every region in the country except the louisiana alabama area. I tell myself im saving that for last because i know ill love it.
super !
This guy is a star!
stopped here for a po'boy on a road trip this summer, this place rules.
I ever make it to New Orleans... I'm eating here.
Excellent
I can live vicariously through anybody who has the pleasure of enjoying one of these sandwiches
Kidney People are my favorite kind whether donor or patient as we all struggle with the #1 killer in the US.
oh lordy... I need this in my belly... all of it.
Never let the Americans control the narrative of history, particularly when it comes to New Orleans. Louisiana was named after Louis XIV, and all of New Orleans can be traced back to a young boy named King Louis XV. He owned all of the land in Louisiana that later became New Orleans and wanted to encourage his fellow Frenchmen to settle there. However, when there were no takers, he decided to send over French prisoners, including thieves, gamblers, prostitutes, murderers, pirates, gypsies, pickpockets, and psychopaths. These individuals became the inhabitants of Louisiana and forefathers of New Orleans. After the British and French slaughtered all the Indigenous Aboriginals or Native Peoples.
the roast beef sandwich looks like the stuff of dreams
That roast beef is making my mouth water.
This guy is the real deal. When I lived in New Orleans I would go here or Domelise's - my two favorite po boy places. Every time I went to parkway I would always see him behind the bar or running around the restaurant. He is clearly super involved in making sure this place stays successful. Their surf and turf po boy is hands down the best sandwich iv ever had.
Great video. Can’t wait to go there.
American cuisine is one of a kind! 💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽
Looks like a Gatspy here in Cape Town, South Africa 🇿🇦
Cool dude.
looks delicious
Uhh...y'all hiring?!
Bro is in control
Great vid
True New Orleans Accent. "like a Brooklyn firefighter on Valium" 😁
All I can say is Wow!
A true leader
My Names Forest, Forest Gump
I’ve had Parkway so many times and it hits every single time. No fail.
Great dude great food 😋
Great guy, great food.
Thats basically what we call a Gatsby in south Africa 😅
Ok this place just made my bucket list.
What a manager. What a sandwich. Have gone and will be back!
I think imma have to reconsider my life choices. Cause I DO NOT! love my job like this. At all. Lol. True passion , he has.
7/17/24 James Brown, $13.29 yum
I have several restaurants. Where can I find a manager like that?
A true Justin.
Making these famous New Orleans sandwiches provides a delicious journey through the city’s culinary landscape. Each sandwich reflects a unique blend of cultural influences, local ingredients, and historical significance.
Nice portions on protein. Lots of other places skimp on protein.
Forget about the sandwiches, it's all about that dude's love for his business and love for running it. He would be successful in whatever he landed on.
They ain't coming to you Justin, trust me. They ain't coming to see you either.
when he greeted the bread delivery guys you could see they never saw him doing that or helping them haha
Not many famous American sandwiches
🇨🇳😗
it's owsome！
Now THIS was time well spent. I am a little envious of your employees that look to be part of a valued team doing a fast paced, delicious job. For me, this is a dream job.
As a german french Baguette is amazing but i dont get it why the nice crispy ends are a problem they are the best part
🙄
Organized  extremely  well.
The kinda boss/manager most places need but never get. Respect.
anyone else watching a day b4 payday and have not eaten for 2 days ? lol
Been to Parkway, it’s the real deal, always busy but surprisingly fast
This boss is amazing
As a native of NOLA, if poboys actually switched to vietnamese french bread, poboys would be even better.  Point? French inspired the bread -- but yeah, the Vietnamese do it better than NOLA.
I can watch this video over and over.
He has a picture of his young self on the wall.  🤔
The true definition of a "boss"
wait, no fried oyster or chicken liver poor boy option?
Respect for this guy! Not only for how hard he works, but he doesn’t knock the competition! He talked about how the Vietnamese influence with their banh minh sandwiches have grown in NOLA!
Love how he greets the baker truck dude
Excellent GM. He's got efficiency down to a science
This guy should be the a for some eating or cooking show
This guy knows what he's doing. 😎🙏🏿💪🏿👍🏿🙌🏿🌍🤾🏿‍♂️
Amazing what they do. Next time we are in town. I am going!
I love French 🥖
Dude’s looking like young david letterman
Whole video feels like a skit- like the show tires
This guy loves what he does.
Just finished lunch but hungry again watching this.
this bread looks absolutely ghastly, but the sandwich is probably tasty enough
What a cool dude
Where do you buy those fries?
Dude's a presenter
That's a lot of beef for one sandwich. Forget about poor boy, that's for hungry boys
He talked more black when he saw the black dude
Shut it
Sandwiches are cheap brother
The power of capitalism innovation and someone who cares and is driven.
I picked the wrong week to try low carb...
This guy is gold
20:55  more than the roast beef 😂
The employee carpool is so awesome
Look like totally scrumptious sarnies but… the logistics of that site look like a freekin’ nightmare!
This guy probably lives the best life
I hope they all get a free meal a day
Hello Justin, family and fiends, I hope you are all well. What a smashing video. I watch a few cooking videos and if they are rubbish I never go back. Yours is great. Take care and stay safe. Tim W, England.
Bread delivered with open bags , not very hygienic,
GET THIS GUY A TV SHOW
what an operation!!!
This is a really well done piece about a fantastic place. We were there last summer and the food is absolutely amazing. One thing he didn't mention was the Pink Lemonade that they serve...it's so refreshing on a hot summer day! I had the Parkway Surf & Turf and it was the best sandwich I have ever eaten. Highly recommend this place. It's a 10 out of 10 in my book!
I'm about to eat this keyboard watching that roast beef and jambalaya get made up.
One of the best gms I ever seen
Jambalaya should be sausage in butter, then trinity into both fats. Way better and sausage first browns and adds texture. What do I know?!?
Loved every second of this
The Amrican Dream.
9:05 Not a very LEAN proces to be transporting it back and forth like that.
Everyone like…”why is this fool so friendly today?”
Legendary
Best Food City in America.
Great video! You can feel the passion he has for his job. Beautiful!
Wow. This is unquestionably the best setup and management of a very complex food service operation I’ve ever seen. That the food is incredible to boot is all the more impressive. Bravo. Definitely on my visit list.
Bro you are al capone of sandwiches, the lucky luciano of letuce
I love the bread slicing station. I always like wood chips and sawdust on my sandwich.
You cant learn Charisma,  your born with it...He got charisma.

OMG!!😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋
Yeah da City way let da meat fall off da side
She wanted roast beef and all his money
Three things in human life are important. The first is to be kind. The second is to be kind. The third is to be kind.
Character cannot be developed in ease and quiet. Only through experience of trial and suffering can the soul be strengthened, vision cleared, ambition inspired, and success achieved.
he looks like a southern Joaquin Phoenix
You're not obligated to win. You're obligated to keep trying to do the best you can every day.
I would come to New Orleans just for a po' boy. Also the music. <3
Amazing number of sandwiches made! Terrific organization!
Very cool video. This guy cares about his food. Service. Customers...and most importantly his employees. Very refreshing to watch this.
Wow 👨🏼‍🍳🌳🍋🥪🍞🥗☕️
Hope bro is a millionaire ong
I love New Orleans i love po boys i love red beans n rice i love everything 😋😋😋
Video game nerd's new job. What a lookalike lol
Respect
Definitely one of my favorite of these videos!
Looking for more than a poboy lmao, classic to tell your kids. Lol
They do have great poboys. I used to live close and get them often.
I lived in NOLA for 4 years and only got to eat at Parkway once but this makes me want to go back to try it again! ❤
I need to go to NOLA for blankend redfish, a shrimp po boy & a Pat O’Brien’s hurricane!
I worked for the Red Cross in New Orleans during Katrina Rita and the Po-Boy spots stayed open. True soul of the city. ❤
This guy is so fu.... Irritating 😑
There’s only a few true people who are meant to be a boss. He sure is a leader !
Living in the greater New Orleans it's nice to see this Parkway video. Need to go there again soon.
As a New Orleans native. This is the best po boy in Nola.
I was born and raised in New Orleans. Have eaten there many times. It is superb! His passion and dedication are admirable! Thats why they sre so successful! Just dont be on a diet when you go there!😂
I've lived in Nola my whole life.  This place is the sh*t. The James brown might be the best sandwich I've had in this life.  If you come here, go there.
I love this guy!
This place is great
they do not skimp on dat shrimp, its always overflowing! Thanks justin
My hangover needed to see this today.   Do they deliver to Europe?
Looks amazing!! I will definitely visit when I’m down south!! Yumm 🇨🇦
He is bad in tips draw him in uber
Gotta love that passion
you would never find a place like this in Germany, sad! makes me wanna fly over to the US just to have a taste.
This guy is a true lider, amazing dude...
I’m excited for the day I am in NOLA indulging in all of there amazing places. If i could have po boy a day i would
It’s all about the bread!  I wants the shrimp poboy he made with it all falling out…..
I'll make sure to visit this spot when I go back to New Orleans
I recognized Justin because he and Parkway Bakery were on a Canadian show called "You Gotta Eat Here" about 10 years ago (kinda like Diners, Drive-ins & Dives).  Had no idea his operation was as complex as it is!
Anyone want money on that’s the first time he’s picked up a worker or been in the kitchen for years!?!
his team dont look too happy
You lost my business doint use aluminum its toxic. And low quality beaf.
Yeah I'm 15 years in the restaurant business and I dream of having bosses like this
A 28oz sandwich? For one person?
I can't believe there's a 1.5lb amazing sandwich for only $15 still in America.  That's what you pay for a plain hamburger at a restaurant these days.
This guy is acting like he runs space x except the guy who runs space x doesn’t act like this …
The peace sign changing to a seven
Silence of the Hams is an incredible name.
This is fascinating to me! ❤
Great Episode Now I am starving
I ought to get myself a US visa and fly out there. Gonna tell the embassy staff that this is my main reason to go to the US
He started talking like a black dude when he met the bread guy 😂
guys a legend
The "you gotta go* is cheesy. Youre using it on all episodes... Even when it doesn't apply to the chef or energy of the kitchen. Your catch phrase is literally ruining the authenticity.
Are those sandwiches for 4 people?
This guy is incredibly charming. The Southern Charm is real, I guess.
“We may be po, but we proud”  Po Folks restaurant  chain 1983

I love this guy. Just geniune pal
I enjoy the hustle. And his staff looks as such. Nothing else matters but the kitchen

Nothing beats Bahn Mi rolls. Nothing.
THE BEST PO-BOYS IN THE CITY! HANDSDOWN
Back in the day Popeye's Chicken used to have po'boy sandwiches but apparently I was the only person who loved them because none of my local Popeyes sells them anymore. It's a shame because they were absolutely delicious.
Dentist Insurance 😢❓️
2:24 typical boring bread with no flavour and on top the most unhealthy type of bread you can use!
muppet
Hahah how fake is this guy 🤦🏼😂
"We care about our heritage, that's why we our small sandwich costs $11.49". You know so the poor people can afford it...
This is never Ever a Frensh Bread !!! Mybe it taste ! But neber ever like a original French Bread !!
reminds me of Snafu
Merci.
nothing like some 2x4 dust with my sammie <3
Well Justin is a complete legend, he was wonderful to watch. A hard working, caring and charismatic manager.
this guy is a homie
this guy reminds me of avgn
Wow, I been to his wife place many times. Awesome place.
Wow, I been to his wife place many times. Awesome place.
I'm a seafood person but that OG Roast Beef is off the hook.  OMFG
If I ever go to New Orleans, this made the list of must-stop. Genuine, well-organized, and looks super tasty!
He looks and talks like Matt Dillon in The house that Jack built
this dude is a treasure
Thats a sandwich factory
What a host kudos
super great video sir ❤❤😍😍
Nobody looks enthused. Hmmm...
"French Bread" les Français en sueur 😭
This dude is electric on camera.
I've had around 50 of them...they are great
Parkway Bakery is THE place for poor boys.   Been eating at Parkway for over 70 years. My grandfather was a striker who lived down by the car barn. Remember Mr. Timothy well, he helped our family through the strike. I endured his sons for 30 of those years. If you did not know what you wanted the brothers were brutal! When Jay reopened the place in '05 I was lucky to get there before Katrina. I get back to the city every few years now and Parkway is my first and last stop. Heading back in early April but have to leave before the Silence of the Hams - a worthwhile event I encourage all to attend!   Justin - make mine a large dressed roast beef with fried pickles on the side, a Barq's and a piece of French Bread Pudding for dessert. My wife will have a large dressed Gulf Shrimp, a Barq's and a couple of chocolate chip cookies.
We just went here to eat for the first time today. We are in New Orleans for a conference. This place is the real deal.  I had a small shrimp poboy. I've never had a shrimp dinner with so much shrimp.  Amazing.
Love it.
Parkway is INSANE. Some of the best food ive ever had
Wish I lived closer that looks absolutely delicious
very cool

If Gordon Ramsay had a show called Kitchen Sweetdreams, this would be on it!
This guy seems like one of the most down to earth, nicest and genuine people and it definitely resonates.Nothing but respect.
The general manager starts talking black as soon as the bread delivery guy shows up. That was next level cringe.
The amount of shrimp on those Po Boys is just insane!
Real soul!  Gotta love it.
Quite unique. Yes, they are doing the same numbers, but I'm pretty sure if they stayed open even until 8PM, they would do incremental business. Interesting business decision.
They better pay him well!!
Because people dont eant to dine in to eat. Youre paying all that money for rent shiiii ima be enjoying everything i get in my apartment better make it last. Dining in is like for big groups i guess
YEAH BUT >>> I'D PAY ALITTLE MORE FOR BETTER TOMATOES ,,, THOSE TOMS ARE SOOOO PALE
E xpo there sounds like running the pass here in the uk
I need a mini series with this restaurant!
This guy has an entire brigade.  Give major props to the heavies doing the lifting.
Po-boys are so great. Ever get there go to parkway
I like putting my meals in a sandwich also
Fascinating video and Justin's energy and passion for them Po'boys is infectious!
Anyone that orders a burger at a premium po-boy shop like Parkway should be thrown out !!  Of course, I'm only joking.
over priced garbage! FO
There is no scarcity of opportunity to make a living at what you love; theres only scarcity of resolve to make it happen.
A dream is your creative vision for your life in the future. You must break out of your current comfort zone and become comfortable with the unfamiliar and the unknown.
If you take each challenge one step at a time, with faith in every footstep, your strength and understanding will increase.
I had a friend in high school named Rick Shaw, but he was fairly useless as a mode of transport.

There is no great genius without some touch of madness.
So passionate. Love it
would never see republican business owners doing this for their employees
2:11 hope u paid them well too
You and your people make it happen!
5:43 "as a gm" he says, while driving a ford
Amazing guy….loved this show….
what you call a bread invention is .....tadadaaahhh... a standard Baguette! 😂
Wanted some andouille
This company and its production level are amazing! Can’t believe I missed it on my last trip…some 15 years ago
I see why Zion has weight problems
They keep seafood and chicken in near by trays!! What about cross contamination? And allergy consciousness ?
I miss poboys. This video did me in.
I am soooo hungry now...  I need to stop watching food programs .. and Yes the Shrimp 🍤 sandwich made me lick my phone... Why !..
Опетитно  снято не зная  английского без перевода снято удачи проекту
Hey send me some sandwiches to Missouri.
great
Don't call this bread bruh, it hurts to hear  sorry, you know im french
Uncle Pel said “pay me like i’m the best fry cook in the city” i’m so weak 😭
Wish I could visit some day !
Watching this YouTube channel has reignited my love for cooking! The creative recipe ideas and helpful cooking tips have inspired me to get back in the kitchen and try new things.
To take care of your crew are basic leadership.
Best fryer in the city has his boss as a shauffer 👌🏻 that's whats up
Your sandwiches your food looks absolutely delicious and if I’m ever in New Orleans, I will be going to your restaurant cause I want to try every single one of those sandwiches!!
I admire this GM. The GM i know never interact with the staff let alone the customer 😅
Isso parece melhor do que SUBWAY...
Does nobody care about this guy obviously code switching every time he talks to a black person? That's cringy af dude
i love how everybody is saying "his passion and motivation is insane" but the thing is, pursuing your passion comes at a stake. when you are starting a new idea that contains all ur passion, it doesnt succeed all the time. 90% people put their passion to an end bcz they either dont make any money or are forced to put it out. at this point a lot of people arent in the state to pursue their passions just bcz lack of money. lucky are those who get to chase their dreams without having to worry and when all the favors are to their side.
Super Place 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
This made me tear up a bit ngl, i feel like im there w them and the love that goes into these sandwiches can be feel through the screen🥺
He is forrest gumpppp😂😂😂😂
respectful passionnate and acts like a boss yes sir
In late Dec 2023 I had the opportunity to visit this po'boy paradise, and taste the "JamesBrown" and The Rum Cake. One of the best moment of my life so far !!! 😇
All yours for 34.99 plus tip
This episode coulda been 6 hours and I woulda watched
Umm does this great boss provide dental insurance???
This place is legit. Definitely doesn't hold back on what loaded into these sandwiches.
Bro sounds like David Schwimmer
I like how the sandwiches are made by feel…. 🥖
Now I can kick it with him you can tell he’s very inviting
dude seems legit
Alex's phone number gettin blasted all over youtube
Stuff looks amazing sadly wearing a watch as a cook is a horrible idea and I could only feel cringe after noticing it after the first minute or so. As a fellow cook I am all about sanitation and cleanliness before cooking. As cook we can’t ignore the small stuff people lives are in our hands .
The history 👍the passion👍,i ❤ this guy
do u toast the bread if someone asks?
Silly question… does all of the paper that the bread arrives in, get recycled or reused somehow?
All my non-americans turning the captions on
Love this😊
After 25 years in the restaurant business, you learn to identify the people you’d be happy to go to war with. This guy really exudes all the qualities of a gentleman I’d be happy to support.
I’ve brought so many people to this place and every single one says its the best sandwich they’ve ever had.
Dude’s a legend.
This is what commitment looks like
this dude changes accents more than a Russian spy
Not him violating HIPPA:P Food looks yum
i was roadtripping and stopped by a "Cajun" restaurant and ordered an oyster po'boy and it had 4 oysters...2 on each side when they cut it and it wasnt seasoned. As someone who has been to New Orleans a lot i was pissed at that garbage they gave me
Great video!
Love this manager I wish there were more like him!
someone let Zion know....I understand...
Justin is a true leader
Worrying to see so many workers who seem to be well into their 70s....
Po Boys, red beans and rice, gumbo and cafe du Monde beignets are what I yearn for everytime I visit New Orleans
This was one of the greatest is not the best presentation for a restaurant and I loved it. Now, I actually want to visit!
The lad is the living embodiment of a positive manager. Could listen and learn all day!
I just stumbled on this inadvertently and have been mesmerized for the full 21 minutes ....kudos to you !
I want the James Brown.   Mmmmmmm.
Now im hungry
Is this a the office Episode?
If "The Chef" was a happy show
I went to N.O on vacation ate parkway everyday
Get rid of the lettuce and tomatoes and you having a perfect sandwich. If I these sandwiches I always remove the letttuce and tomatoes before I dig in. They have no meaning for the sandwich only for color. Thats it.
This guy is what life’s all about!
Awesome presentation
Killer.
I was just there two weeks ago. One of my favorites in the city. My favorite debris.
I know I’m gonna be making one of these. They look delicious.
So big… how can anyone eat such a huge single roll?  Even after a day of weight lifting and playing rugby I couldn't eat a whole one….  Do Americans just eat more food than other countries, per person?
Tummy
i love small business
The most American and white people I ever seen
Well done po'boy video!
idk wha it is with these type of food videos but youtube said this is a 21min long video i felt like it only lasted 5min
WOW that place runs like a Swiss watch.  They should get a James Beard award.
Love this guy. He hates measuring Shrimp. Just grab two handful and call it a day 🤣
Master of his craft.
Why he don't bake his own ?
THis guy is solid. I like him just off the interview!
This place would make for a great tv series like “The Bear.”
This guy is amazing! I wish I had his energy.
2.5 minutes in & I'm dyin'...& drooling!😮
Lmao hes out of breath after helping carry the bread. Def only did it because the cameras were there
This guy is rad!
‘Silence of the Hams’ 😂😂😂… what a name though for a BBQ-Squad
He is a professional and passionate Sheff 👏 👍👍👍
WOW! They have a whole state of the art process behind preparing some Roast Beef. Like down to a science.  I respect his love and commitment to his business, his family and employees and his city.
Eat ya heart out subway
AWESOME, absolutely love seeing a boss getting his hand in. ❤❤👍👍
Legend.
What a Stellar production. 🎬🥖🍤 Looks delicious.😛
Mr. Kennedy's Heart has always been devoted & steadfast to His business, Poor Boys Sandwiches, quite impressive and inspiring...😎
i miss this spot since i've moved <3
Shut your eyes... Sam Sulek, minus the gains
I reveled in the delectable sights of this restaurant.
watching this video while being an employee for starbucks is more depressed u guys
12:20 is my favourite part of this video. A rustic hand made sandwich is how it should be done. Deep filled and who cares if there’s 5 shrimp more or less than the last sandwich.
That parkinglot system is insane. Insanely ingenious.
Them Kennedy Boys at it again!
This is the type of person we should all strive to be. He's got such a great, infectious demeanor
This is amazing!  Thank you for sharing

Looks amazing
Als er angefangen hat über Brot zu reden war ich raus.
His voice doesnt fit his body.. very sympathic guy tho
now this is a GM
Important to point out that he says the shrimp are coated with “corn flour.”  Yes, it is a real thing and it is not the same as corn starch. It’s like cornmeal but ground much much finer (like flour, duh).  Too many times people argue that it’s just corn starch but it’s not.
If anyone of you is still looking for subway in 5km radius, ‘stop it, get some help’
Yo, how he [at 6:22] worrkin' with some tooth missin' out of him mouth? Aint you afraid of da juice in his mouth droppin' in da sandwiches when things get shaky for 'im? 😮
he the coolest guy
She was lookin for more than the roast beef 😂😂😂😂
Been there!! Best Po-boy in New Orleans!   Two questions 1) Justin, who won the competition, you or your wife?  Second question kinda a combo, when/where is the competition?  And is it open to the public?
Parkway has definitely have the best pó boys in  New Orleans
This is the very best video I’ve ever watched on you tube. Talk about a dedicated shop owner looking out for his suppliers and his employees. The very best!
I wish you could deliver to Ohio!!!
What a fantastic business model.🎉
Another reason to get a flight to New Orleans  ASAP.
My mouth is watering...
Dude is a badass!
parkway tav ok. Overpriced. Not in top 10 NOLA poboys anymore❤
Sooo...what is in Spicy Mayo?  What type or flavor, i.e. Dill, Sweet, etc. of Pickles do you use?  What brand or type of BBQ Sauce do you use?  Is that Au jus on the Streetcar/RB  Po' Boy or do you actually thicken the pan juices?
"Whatta cool boss" is all I'm gonna say. Hands down 💯👏
2:40 that’s the beauty of the Vietnamese baguettes aka “bánh mì” as well 😉  12:18 corner-to corner that is perfection
To Live in an apartment upstairs, shows how much he cares.
Now I've got reason to fly to NOLA 😂😂
DUDE!! Love this Guy. Gotta get there and order up several Po'Boys!
Do you guys deliver to the North of England? :)
great  selection by owner for GM. such a passionate dude.
This guy definitely sounds like he wishes he was black.
Nothing worse than a soft, melt in your mouth roll for sandwhiches.  No thanks.  Ill take a nice hard, tasty, italian roll.  I dont wanna be eating soggy bread.
Gotta respect the golf shirt tucked into the track pants.
What an amazing business and a true example of people caring for other people....I wish them  the best!!!
What an absolute beast Justin is
I love this guy, genuine person. Would love to go eat his food next time i'm in town.
Zion's favorite place
so this why Zion can't lose any weight
making sure everything is flowing...pretty sure you are in the way! they got it!
You want a Great sandwich - Go to Philly . The Poorboy doesn't come close to a south Philly Hoagie
Always thought it was funny the best french bread in the city is german
I need the shrimp sandwich 🤤
I truly miss that about NO.....been too long!
im sorry but this is subway nothing special
Great personalty! True passionate GM. Amazing guy with an amazing team!
Ya boy is a G!
I swear this guy has some black in him😂😂😂😂😂😅😅😅😅
GREAT VIDEO !
All about the bread… and the peeps❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
wish I had your energy bro!
Corporate America needs to wake up and take notice of how you treat your employees 😊😊😊😊
That place gave me diarrhea
Sure miss Brad working for BA..
This is toooooo coool I need to go
Had a beer with Justin around the corner at Finn McCools. Awesome guy.
Omg that roast beef sandwich made my mouth water. I need to go to NOLA really soon.
That guy looks like he was born to run a tv show damm.
all the staff look highly pissed off.
They use to delivery their Jambalaya on Goldbelly, it was super delicious.
Why are Americans obsessed with Gravy that roast beef po-boy was covered in gravy, you don't need mayo on that thing
Oh my now thats cookin with lots of love 😋😍
I want to go to there!🤗
65 years ago(I am 77 now)my family went to New Orleans.  I loved the Po'boy and I think it was the oyster loaf not sure.  The place was a few blocks behind canal street called George's I think.  A  little place but recommended by locals.  My dream is to come to New Orleans, see the French Quarters again, and have Po' Boys.  I will definitely come to eat at your place.  I live in Southern Virginia now.
Do not watch this video if you are even slightly hungry..
that was great, dude is a boss, enjoyed watching
Now im homesick!!! 😢
More of this guy.
Why do you have to pack the sandwich so much,it’s just too messy..I would have no joy in eating that..
hhhh
It takes Alot to get me wanting to travel. This did it. That food looks Amazing!
This type of person is exactly why I love Louisiana ❤
shrimp poboy is the best
What a business...What a pro....
"You got to take care of your people, because without them you got nothing." .... True leadership.
Went to the NO in 2000 for mardi gras an i can say i got my first poor boy at a gas station an OMG it was the best 💯😊
When I travel to New Orleans, I always have a poor boy, no such thing as a bad poor boy, doesn’t matter, catfish, shrimp, oysters, no wrong here. The bread is truly key in the delicious poor boy .
The owner is a champion shop owner and operator ,takes pride in his food ,staff ,customers . No wonder his business shines.
This guy reminds me of Forrest Gump.. passionate..sweet...picked up a sandwich instead of ping-pong. "Lieutenant Dan Sandwich"
5:52 the fact that he Picked up his employee that different 🥹…I worked in the Food industry and the fact that he treats them like his own is special
Did he put miracle whip in those po boys?
Grats def seems well run place.
He definitely deserves that position and more
Love it... I'm hungry now.
Yes... incredible!!!
So no one is noticing the facade he's putting on for the camera? Y'all really that dumb huh. No wonder everyone is trying to cancel comedy. P.s i didn't see one smile on one workers' face
The body language suggests he treats everyone like ****
Looks yummy
Another to add to the bucket list!
Rarely does one ever see such a flame of passion, energy and love. Keep at it, Justin and Parkway Team! 💪
If I EVER make it to New Orleans I pray I remember to pay these folks a visit!
cookin!
Honestly, I think the po'boy is overrated.  Just my opinion.
Love this guy 😂
My family has been going to Parkway for 50 years and i remember before Katrina when it was just the original section. It was and still is the best poboy in the city. Justin knows my parents by name and he is always kind and you can tell he loves his employees and customers. My folks go there so much that they gave them gift cards for being customers of the month, I think it was made up lmao
Sloppy roast beef?  Now im thinkin arbys
SLOPPPP EMMM UPPP
I want to make a trip to nola just to meet this guy
tbh at first glance i tought that this will be the usual rich high class degeneracy. what a pleasant surprise that its the exact opposite, tickles my semi-buried dream of operating a western style saloon for some reason..
Does anyone remember Captain Humble in Slidell and his delicious Po'boys? Not to knock Justin Kennedy or his own cooking, but Captain Humble made some great Po'boys and was probably the most friendliest person I've ever met.
Love my niggahs food
Poboy bread and muffuletta  are dense. IDK what you are on about it not being dense I think that may be due to a lack of refrence. If you compare it to teh hoagie rolls in the north east around PA, NY and NJ you get a better point of reference.
True hard working American 🇺🇸
As a NOLA native I can personally tell you that Parkway I'd thee best hands down!!! And you MUST try the banana pudding 😋
What a guy - a proper manager who knows the business inside out and has worked his way up. I bet his employees love him.
Now that is passion! I love it!! This guy is amazing!
It's just like Subway sandwiches... ok, i get out.🤣🤣🤣
This dude is the best gm to ever exist
Willy and the Poor Boys
I need to go here and have every one of these sandwiches!!!!!
I'm going to New Orleans for Mardi Gras this year. I'm gonna try to stop by.
that roast beef and gravy looks incredible
how does subway think we see them
I hope he didn't use the loaf he broke apart without washing his hands. He came straight downstairs touching things. 😅  I love the technique he uses to retain the moisture in the meat.
Can we get a sequel next year?
He's the Harry Connick Jr. of Po'boys'!
Very caring dude; also a great manager and passionate cook.
irks me when people cook food for others and not wear gloves when they choose to leave their rings on. pretty cool manager tho
Dude needs his own show @foodnetwork
Great video
this is an awesome video.
There's a thing in Confederacy of Dunces about how some New Orleans accents have a lot of Brooklyn in them but I'd never been able to picture that before listening to this guy
Quite an impressive operation. Hope to visit someday...
I feel like he is the kind of boss every employee secretly hates
Looks nice. Kinda like a Cape Town gatsby.
Very interesting 😊😊
This video had my mouth watering 🤤🤤
the prices arent poor boy prices
No wonder Americans are morbidly obese
This manager is the definition of "You can't make it? ill come get you, where you at?"
The James Brown sandwich looks ridiculous, omg 😮
looks amazing. well done
I think it’s wonderful when people love their job, no matter what their job is when you love it, it doesn’t feel like a job.😊❤
Justin’s passion and heart are evident and infectious!  My friends and I are definitely going to his restaurants when we go to New Orleans!  Thank you!
Been watching all these New Orleans videos and the same themes. Owners white workers blacks smh
Dudes a natural in front of the camera
We stopped by here on our last trip to NOLA, and this guy is truly a genius, gentleman and is exactly what you see in this video. And the food and crew are all amazing.
I love his enthusiasm what a guy
This was really cool. Justin was awesome and the the drive-thru system was cool to see
Been here plenty of times even ate one and got one to go for the plane never considered how much goes into getting the food in your hands truly a blessing when your there it’s fast and looks effortless ❤
What an amazing place and the organization is incredible. He is a credit to his family and the business
The best poboy in the city. Bar none
This guy seems cool as
I normally like watching this but this guy is a bit to full off himself.
Him saying that each person could do every thing on the ticket made me think Of different spots I worked and some owners are smart like this dude  or like everyone else, they want to see you get fired.  Got to give people at least a month for some spots.
1.5lb  poboy in my belly?? No way.  I am not young anymore😅
What do you know about buttered sausage
far out love the passion, knowledge and the history. what an icon.
DUDE! This guy knows!!
Where can a brother fill out an app?
Eu sou do Brasil, e fiquei impressionado com o profissionalismo desse empresário, morando em cima do próprio negócio, isso só reforça isso, o cara merece todo sucesso.
A boss  that works the line and doesn't see his employees  as cattle  what a rare  specimens
The food in Naw'leans is incredible period
When did the rice go in the jambalaya?
Justin has a charm , make me wanna have poboy  in his tavern even living at another corner of earth!!!
“I gotta cook in bulk.” Best line of the video! Felt that in my soul lol.
She was looking for more than a roast beef is crazyy😂😂
I'd put that on a cracker
Now I gotta go eat there.
I'm surprised to not see any comments about how pretentious and fake this guy comes off. I'm honestly not trying to be rude, but as soon as he said he gets bread delivered every day and then treats the delivery guys with handshakes and hugs, I knew he was faking it. You see these guys every day. Why ham it up for the camera? I would bet money, before the day they filmed this, he had NEVER helped unload the bread. It just threw the whole vibe off, makes the guy feel fake.
Seems like a great guy. So passionate and informative. Should have his own tv show.
Awesome guy
“Silence of the Hams” 😂😂😂😂
I can see you don’t have a dental plan, and I don’t think you pay your workers
This is what's wrong with America. a poor boy is food banks/ soup kitchen fair. It's supposed to be cheap off cuts, high calorie. not some sort of filthy deluxe
This guy is great!
Slangin po boys
Dam 400 punds of beef. This  guy has Passion. Proud to be an American.
Love these videos!!
If that dude was not married, I’d marry him
Bucket list for sure!!!!
Great video, I appreciate you taking your time to share. I love watching how a restaurant does it's thing. Great stuff!!
Looking very nice!! Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to you and your Staff.😊
I’m stopping by next time i visit Nola. I love the employee carpool and family vibes💟🫶🏾
I love how jazz is playing in the video background and this is about New Orleans :) great touch!
He looks like the angry video game nerd (AVGN)
Like your business ethics  What American Business Use to Be
This video of my go to PoBoy spot in Nawlins is so awesome!!! But now I’m hungry…
Never heard of ‘em.  Mother’s is THE place
I dont blame Zion no more
Definition of standing on business
cool vid, he's a great host
that roast beef tho...
The fact that he can still do says everything.
This guy has an incredible voice, it's like Tom Hanks' except even better!
This dude is on point
I ate at your establishment back in 2018 it was one of the best sandwiches I ever put in my mouth. The roast beef is hands-down second to none and the jambalaya I took with me back to the hotel and ate it after a night of drinking on Bourbon Street. Lol it was amazing too.
this guy was a very entertaining host. please have him tour more of the local spots out there. thanks!
This is the most articulate and passionate owner I have ever seen! He is so knowledgeable and involved
I rarely get emotional over a sandwich.. but this one got me
Blessings to you all. Wonderful ❤
This guy stands on business😊
Very rare to find someone with this kind of professionalism and mastery of their craft. Without question going to have to make a pilgrimage to this establishment next time I get a chance.
Here in the UK that "sandwich" would feed 3 people!😂
$18 poor boy ain’t no poor boy no more.
What a wanker. Thinkers he’s soo coool but. Rich boy
why does he also turn black when talking to the black guy
Nothing better than a NOLA 7-napkin Roast Beef Poboy
What an operation.  Crazy.
well that was a quick 20 minutes.
Totally awesome !!!
Lovely y'at accent he has.
the level of attention to detail in a family run place, its insane
This dude needs his own show for real! How engaging, love the roast beef line 🤣🤣
Nice caveat...that Olde Tyme Grocery plug...love that place, and I haven't been to Parkway.  Will try it sometime.
Give me shrimp poboys or give me death!
The James Brown!!
This is somebody who deserves to be highlighted. He is passions about everything that happens in his kitchen not to mention he is hilarious!!😂
Using white bread is so unhealthy
Anyone else feel like Tom Hanks could play this guy? I think it’s the voice
Well sir I think she actually was looking for that beef. 🤣🤣🤣

Nice soggy sandwich lol

One thing I love about the look of NEw Orleans is it’s like a giant hodgepodge
Best sandwich in America.
New Orleans has the best food in America.
I have a running list of restaurants I want to go to all over the world… just added Parkway to my New Orleans list! 🤤
Best food city in America.
DAYUM, Smalls….that roast beef sammich! 😛🤤
He no Po’boy now with the Ivy League fake po’ accent 😂😂 great sandwich though.
Would you live on top of your job if they give you free housing???
I went to Parkway a few months ago and I saw the picture at 15:26 and thought, “what a handsome guy” lol had no clue that was the current manager
I wish so bad that I could get me some New Orleans French loafs up here in the PNW
Cheers!!
His attitude is admirable
I told my wife we going to Parkway Bakery for vacation, she says WHAT!
😂😂😂…….okay sir
🤧 wet bread
If u can't make it to LA, try Popeyes Po' Boys
This guy knows his stuff.
I miss living there. 🤗
Daddy is hot asf. Ngl
I’m sorry, but the breading in that shrimp looked way too thick. I want to taste Shrimp not fry in my sandwich.
Great video! I hope to go there and see you all some day.
"you sitting in the front seat today" Does that mean he makes him sit in the back when cameras are not there....
every new orleans video is an instant classic
Ownership loves that guy with the bad teeth for his low wage dedication
This guy needs a life…..
That looks nothing like the Popeyes in my town😵
She wanted more than dat roast beef 😅😆
His amazing. Great vibes ❤🇬🇧👊🏼
I worked at Taco Bell for 30 days and I lost that place so much money due to lag times lol I couldn't never do this
That james brown looks delicious
Quality with love.
That is one well run, extremely efficient restaurant.
Aiming to be there next year!
Bro is 73. let him retire 😭
What a fantastic video!  Who knew that so much went into a po-boy sandwich?  There's nothing simple about it — that roast beef po-boy actually started TWO DAYS ago!  After seeing this behind-the-scenes video, I'm going to appreciate my next Parkway sandwich all the more!
New orleans has just something special in the air. This place looks amazing wish i went when i was there. Most underrated city in the world
Id rather have a mufaletta
Anyone who knows. The rest of them are saying get this mf’r out of the way. Get back behind your desk.
If Forrest Gump got into sandwiches instead of shrimp
The James Brown looks amazing! I gotta try that someday
So cool to see a guy I grew up with on YouTube!
This makes me legit hard.....
Lived in NOLA all my life and still never been here.   I’m definitely going now.
Price?
Now I am really hungry
Granted it definitely wasn’t this guys po boy. That one sandwich made me feel poor, this sandwich looks luxurious and rich.
The only po boy I had in New Orleans was so stale it cut the roof of my mouth. Also was like 15 dollars. Rather get a muffuletta and I don’t like olive spread.
You'll see the rainbow bridge after it rains cats and dogs.
They talk so theatrical, it's interesting.
I’ve seen this guy on other food shows and he never disappoints with his passion. He truly loves what he does and his love for NOLA. He loves his job.
Gotta respect a boss that has done every job in the kitchen and still remembers what it was like being a line cook or expo.
My people 😎 !
I ate my first po'boy here this year-- shrimp and oyster. It very well could be the best sandwich I've ever had.
this guy loves his job
200 lbs. of chicken and sausage jambalaya, you say?  Hand me a fork.  I can make a dent in it.
I want one now
This guy is a general manager? Nah this guy is made to be on television haha
It's great seeing someone have so much passion for what they do.
Another Kennedy is making a great impact 👍👍 - MDK
The roast beef and fried shrimp surf and turf is fire!!!!!!!!
Parkway my favorite 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾😁😁😁😁
I love eating sandwiches as much as he loves making them ^_^ Wish I had the money to travel the US for a food tour.
Phenomenal video. Ive had the pleasure of eating at Parkway and it’s fantastic.
Interesting 👍🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
now i see what the problem with Zion Williams is
This guy and his team are awesome! You can tell he's passionate about the food. That's what it takes to be around that town for as long as that place has been around. There's a lot of competition for restaurants in that town. Lots of great food, and lots of just ok food. This place gets that it's the people and the relationships that make it stand out.
This is why robots are coming
And how much do you pay them to come on ya yacht   hmmmm
"New Orleans: 1000 restaurants, 1 menu"  😂
Sopranos vibe
Love this guy, also love how he can run any station 👌🏾
Justin legend. Infectious personality.
That's James brown looks 🔥🔥🔥🔥 I need that asap and acourse gotta have the jambalaya
You really give the impression that you do not care about the health care and well being of your employees; you are just doing it for the business
Do not let this guys easy demeanor fool you. Running an operation this size with their care & quality is incredibly difficult. Awesome seeing this passion, truly inspiring. Hope to have one of these sandwiches one day.
You can tell he loves this & takes pride in carrying on the tradition. I bet you can taste that dedication!
Loved his love story at the end: “looking for more than the roast beef”!!!
THIS OWNER DUDE IS LIKE A PLAYBOI, GANSTA AND LEGIT BUSINESS OWNER ALL IN 1. HE 🔥
this is what a general manager looks like.
my respect for parkway just skyrocketed.  just remember: closed on tuesdays
Sorry, but this bread looks atrocious.
Channel with the most ads. I swear.
when the boss cares about EVERYTHING other than just overall numbers the business will stay successful .
This guy seems fake ngl
The dude is a legend. The fact he picks up the OG everyday is just beautiful.
Love new orleans, only been once but lawd it's always calling me back!!
someone that cares about what he does and the people around him. we need more people like him!
The employees don't look at him with adoration.
9:56 Americans, please stop calling it "au jus" au means "with" so you're calling the gravy, with juice. its just Jus!
I wonder if they make gator sandwich?
Come back and do Banks on Broad
So no dental..??
I hope to be as passionate about something half as much as him. What a great team leader too
Why he dont have a car tho
Loved this one. Loving what he does
Keep to chefs. This guy was ..... not it
Huh?
$25 to $30 for sandwiches is a bit pricey 😂❤
Oh man!I miss living down there.This is great.
was that guy paid to do this piece?
Fake, this dude ain't sh**
I've never more passionate indentured servitude
how do you  measure profits if you don't  portion control?🤔🤔🤔
I have been 2 times in my life and had the James Brown and the OG. That place will be there for 100 more years. 🎉
I just ate at parkway today. Besr sandwich ive ever had.
You know he don’t be doing none of this on a regular day
This guy needs his own show 😉
He is such a kind and awesome soul. Met him several times
Yo
On heroin and muching sour treats but this onr
I've been eating here once a week for years
Outstanding
This isnt just a business this is an operation
Simply beautiful, The surf and turf, Long Island Ice tea, and Breading Pudding yummy
Justins passion is out of this world!
A history lesson as well as a cooking video, what more could you want
Definitely understand why the guy's so passionate but nah. SF sourdough > poboy bread
I ate here and that sandwich was nothing special
This is great!
Everyone is surprised by this but this is how New Orleans locals act 😂 😂 🤣 🤣 New Orleans is the hospitality city
Not gonna lie I hope he wasn’t putting on a show but if he was legit like this all the time I wouldn’t mind stay in the food industry, more bosses should be like him, this dude is passionate and a great leader
Employee carpool by the bossman himself is wild respect
That James Brown looks incredible
Wth, dude look exactly the same during his teenage years
That was fascinating to watch, and it was 100 percent this guy's energy.  He is awesome.
I felt like this guy just tryed to sell me the best magical sandwhich ever
So cool
Is this the bear?
Oweeee
Booking my flight asap
I plan on going there this month when I pass through.  I've actually never had a roast beef po-boy in my life - always had oyster and/or shrimp.
"I could kinda tell she was lookin for more then the roast beef" LOL
Hands down the best behind-the-scenes to a legendary spot showing how critical it is to run a popular kitchen and keeping everyone there tapped in. Salute! 🫡 maybe a location in Los Angeles can spawn exactly like this one?
just asking no hate but isnt the shrimp one really dry?
Business are successful because of guys like that. Dedication sacrifice passion.
Hey Jack nice video. Hope your health improves. Eat well, strict diet. Bless you.
This guy is absolutely amazing!
everyday except monday and tuesday
What an operation! I hope he pays his crew well. I’ve always wanted to eat at this place.
That “James Brown” will HAUNT all of my delicious dreams…🤤
This video is equivalent to an MBA...
Give this guy his own tv show, I could watch him all day long
I swear this dude made me want to try there food great attitude and love how he takes care of his folks
Eaters audio has been off or fuzzy lately not having any other issues with other major YouTube channels.
justin's passion is infectious!! need me a po’boy asap
Not only does he love his job he calls everyone by their name as well. Mos def need to check this place out if I'm ever in the N.O.
Love seeing the behind the scenes for my favorite poboy spot in Nola!  Olde Tyme Grocery is considered one of the best poboys in Laffayette and Parkway is deff considered one of the best in New Orleans.  Such an interesting story for those two to get together.
Is this one of the guys that has been feeding Zion?
this is why i love america
You can feel the passion. Great guy!
Loved how Justin weighed the sandwich and never skimped on anything. He just wants to make people happy... can't wait to go here one day!
Lemme get dat crabmeat poboy, dressed and pressed. Please and thank you.
You got that ShamWow guy energy, and a bit of the face...
This guy's passion and energy is so pure, no fluff about him. I need to get a James Brown.
" I donated a kidney to my brother" you have my respect sir
Dang this made me so hungry. Need to visit New Orleans again soon! Last time I had a great time! 😊
How do you get this bread if you don't live in Louisiana or New Orleans? What bread is close to what is used for po boys?
TO WHOMEVER NEEDS TO HEAR THIS: YOUR ART MATTERS. PLEASE DON'T STOP CREATING! THEYLL CATCH UP . have a great Wednesday
The relationship with his team is top notch
My favorite surf and turf poboy in the whole world…hands down!!!
Roast beef looks delicious 🔥
That's not a sandwich; that's a four course meal between two bread boats.
No wonder why the obesity rate is skyrocking
8:00 gross
Ehhhhhhh don't worry about it 😝
This dude has waited his whole life to do a video like this.
Just perfect!
He don't feed them, he fats them up!!!
I'm so hungry
this guy could be a host of a sandwhich show.  thanks for keeping it real Justin!
Justins accent doesn't match his look at all, great guy though
Zion is gonna eat you bro
I like how Justin turned black when the bread delivery driver arrived
Getting anxiety just looking at this video
wow u wife is really if u cant be the best join them
Love a boss with hands on experience
On every thorn, delightful wisdom grows, In every rill a sweet instruction flows.
That just jumped to the top of my list if I ever get back to N'alins.   But closing at 6pm on a weekday?  Most people don't even eat dinner that early.  I don't even wake up until 7pm being on midnight's.
If you focus on results, you will never change. If you focus on change, you will get results.
This guy is awesome!
As a restaurant person for over 20 years now working for somebody like this makes a huge difference. Great stuff!
If I ever visit the US defs coming here. He’s such a competent manager, it’s a joy to watch, I’d love to be his understudy🫶🏻
The waitress was not amused when he ordered green eggs and ham.
Everything looked fantastic!!
This guy is too much of a “Watch me…” Watch me pick my best fry cook up, but I don’t do this… Watch me make the roast beef… Watch me make the sandwiches… Watch me expo… Exhausting face. Feature your people.
White dude:  "We prolly be havin' like 5 scrimp on deez po boyz"
That's weird. The story I heard over and over was moms used to make sandwiches with gravy and fries for their children to take to school to eat for breakfast and lunch. They were called poboys because the poor kids ate them.
9:54 EIGHTEEN DOLLARS for a vegan sandwich hahahahahahahaha sucks to be you!!!
Real life ted lasso
I want him to host a tv show based on his daily experiences in that store.
Get the surf and turf. It’s shrimp and roast beef. You’re welcome
I was there last month, this place is no joke. Best bite I had in my whole New Orleans trip. Might be the best sandwich I ever had: Creole BBQ shrimp
i like this dude!
This guy is definitely on top of his game
@8.36 not really roast beef then, more like a braised beef, but I must admit, I do like your sandwiches!!! 'Nuff said..!
Chicago has the Italian beef, Philly has the cheese steak, New York the chopped cheese, and New Orleans the po'boy. Gotta love America 🤘🏼
Just want you all too know...  I've been cooking in restaurants for 20+ years. ....this dude Justin is the real deal.  He gets it.  He cares,...I can sense it.   I will 100000% find where he's cooking if I go to L.A orleans.
Am I the only one who thinks this dude must be a long lost brother of Matt Dillon?
When he said they measure the shrimp by hand when they add the shrimp to the sandwich, I totally understand why Zion can not lose weight lol
Now I’m hungry
Looks delicious every sandwich 😋I would go there, just to try "shrimp po boy" ☺️Owner looks intense, like he wants to serve the best food,and runs a tight ship.👍
I run a small cafe and this dude puts me on show. Incredible dude! well done mate
They should have filmed this on a Wednesday before Thanksgiving
Thank you for showcasing Parkway, they make the best po-boys in NOLA.
Was half expecting to see Zion lurking in the background with 4 or 5 sandwhiches in each hand.
My pop took me New Orleans in 1970 for Mardi gras and great restaurants.. . never forget it
“I gotta cook in bulk.”  Love it.
Poboy sandwich prices are now getting to be for the rich boys
Great video showcasing one of the humblest, but greatest foods out there. I always hit Johnny’s in the French Quarter. Louisiana in general is one of the best food states.
“This is in November!”  Don’t know when this was filmed but it’s seems that order is of no priority.😂😂
Hands down this is the coolest series you’ve made
this place is brilliant, the guys is awesome. you can tell he aint BS, his staff must love him. Great episode!
does anyone know if this guy is passionate about his restaurant? can you let me know
But look at those horrible tomatoes 🍅!
🤤
I wished I had this guys passion
Soo this where Zion Williamson be going huh? Lol
i love him so much
respect
the ending bruh lol
Is it just me or does this guy give off a "Everything is just fine. Just don't look too closely ya hear" vibe. Comes off as hella menacing
Hope the employees  make more than minimum wage
I am dying to go there. ❤
Respect 🫡 to this GM!
I visited NOLA a few years ago and ate here. I STILL dream about their poboys. Absolutely delicious
this guy is gold
We used to walk down the street to parkway, and the line was always out on the sidewalk. Miss this place
I've never needed a streetcar poor boy so badly in my life....
I knew it was going to be Parkway as soon as I saw the title!
What a great episode!
southern drawl is like the spoken rizz accent lol
This was a great episode.
Justin for president
Incredible to see an owner operator so dialed in he even lives above the business to be more efficient. Will definitely visit in the future.
I really respect this guy and his business, but the best sandwich I ever had came out of a fryer in the back of a gas station in New Orleans.  I feel like that's a true po' boy.  "Poor." Lol.
I always take people here when they come down to New Orleans. This place is not a tourism trap at all and does live to its reputation.
😂 the ending
Real southern hospitality. I love New Orleans.
I grew up eating roast beef po' boys in southern Louisiana. Now I make them for my family and it's always a hit.
Feels like a guy that worked there for 12 years should be able to take care of his teeth and buy his own car.
Growing up in key west, shrimp po-boys were always my favorite! Gator too!
Tight ship! I like it!
I visited here during a trip to New Orleans. No lie, the Po Boys here are the best in the city, and I tried many of them during my visit.  They are worth the wait and long lines.
Are you hiring?
Seems like a great boss who really  understands servant leadship.
OMG we are headed to NO in three days, hotel is nine minutes away. CAN NOT WAIT!!!
what if the meat she's getting isn't yours?
Strong The office vibes
One could see the relationship between the po-boy and the banh mi
What a total legend
This guy got to be one of the most infectious and energetic bosses out there! You can tell he truly has a passion for the food.
New Orleans has such an incredible vibe.
Now that guy is cool!!!!!!!!!!
Im not an American so could you guys explain it to me ? .. All i see is  Sandwich.. whats the different of etiher po boy and sandwich ?
Well this guy’s awesome. What a great atmosphere and establishment to be a part of. Starving now
His passion for what he does is so evident.... I love watching people like him.
His accent is so cool.
This guy is so enthusiastic about his job which everything it takes to be a leader. Great video
Legit this guy talking like he’s on MTV cribs ! Love the passion and vibe
One of my favorite videos you have put out!
homies hands be shakin, get him a drink
Great sandwich:)
this guy rules
❤
THAT'S a New Orleans accent.
How is New Orleans not the fattest city in America??
Reminds me of the the show The Bear
He speaks exactly like Sam Sulek
Excellent video , New Orleans has some of the best food ever , no joke !
Awesome Sandwich 🥪
Parkway the best poboy… on the eastbank 😉
“She come in looking for me, I knew she was looking for more than roast beef.” my dude had me dying 😂
Impressive   and v educational.cool.we eat terribly. In UK.unless.  Rich
Nice open till 6 instead of 10.. lots of profit.. for the owner.
Lived and worked in NOLA in kitchens. So much great food and Parkway has #1 poboys . Like the drive-up. Thats is a brilliant move.
I'm diggin this managers leadership style you can tell he knows wtf he doing and that he's super passionate about it.
Bless his heart, he thinks this is what authentic French bread looks like 🥲
So go on Saturday to get the freshest bread?
Passion Love and dedication will make you successful in any business.
I didn't know Hunter Renfrow owned the restaurant 😂
Guy has that southern charm and is passionate, a real experienced GM out there hosting a show while actually helping the back of house.
I appreciate the keeping of the history and tradition. But 12+ dolls for a small "poor boy" sandwich is definitely not for poor folks. The upper middle class probably keeps them in business. So, what started out as a thing for the poor people is now a culturally appropriated trendy thing to go and eat. Just saying...
I tried this last time I was in NOLA. Hands down the best.
Parkway looks like a slave ship. They better be getting paid over $25/hr or it ain’t worth it. Then the micromanaging is crazy.
This guy sandwiches
Class Act. Period.
Bro definitely invited to all the functions
This guy is an incredible lier (or at least exceptional bad at telling the truth)
So living in New Orleans, this is my favorite po'boy place to go to! Especially for the streetcar poboy!!!! Thank you Bon Appetit for making this video and highlighting the behind the scenes of my favorite place!!
ABSOLUTE CHAD
Hats off for this guy donating his Kidney and not bragging about it ❤
LOVE IT
I am echoing what others have said .... this was a great video! Loved Justin's passion for their restaurant and the food they serve.
Completely legit. Made with love. The best.
I'm kicking myself now that I didn't go there last year when I was visiting New Orleans.
All GMs everywhere should take notes
There passionate managers, then there’s this guy! What a great operation they got going. I’d smash that James Brown po boy any day of the week
OK this dude is BADASS!
Give me like 3 of those french bread loaves and a stick of butter and i'm set for the day
loved this, so wholesome
I need to make a trip to New Orleans, the passion this guy has for his sandwiches and his business is heartwarming
This guy's accent changed about 6 times... belongs in Hollywood. Some people can lay it on I guess... 😅
I always get the roast beef po-boy. I understand people that get the fried oyster or shrimp, but the roast beef is just the most sublime mess ever created.
That guy is great! Looooooove po'boys.
This dude is legit
I don't know much about restaurants... With daily deliveries, what happens if something goes wrong? Will they just not have bread for that day?
There are so many places to get great po-boys in New Orleans, but I must say, Parkway's Surf & Turf (fried shrimp with roast beef debris and gravy) is in the upper echelon. 15 napkins minimum.
Best in the city!
A millionth
the passion this guy has... is incredible
What an amazing video. What an amazing vibe. What an amazing team and leader. I love everything about it!
So it is a puffy Baguette? Looks delicious though!
Jambalaya with the Tony Chaceres that's a beast
A real leader
I want this....
👌👌👌👌👌
SECOND? Maybe
I want to give a big shout out to 2009 YouTube and say, with all the love in my heart, first.
