I don't even like United but can't get enough of the meme channel and have to watch more of this guy.
1:15:05 Aaaa Aaaa aaaaa
Hi can someone explain how is that not offside, 49:08
Did anyone notice the fans in the 90th minute singing blades races
Greenwood wasn’t available for face scan as was on Europa league business when they were doing new face scanning
Press square
I am a liverpool fan but this man is legendary not as good as our famous scouser but still legendary
Mark why is there a weird channel called warriors for Christ in your channels
Turned like a bottle top 🤣 37:07
That trigged me
1:15:05 wha🤣🤣🤣🤣

He's a central defensive mid not just a mid
Did anyone else hear him say come on Man City
mark you get random games
1:15:06 When my mom asks me to tidy my room while playing fifa for the first time in 7 months
It means he’s not that posotion
He is a legend
You can turn realistic mode in the settings 😂
Do not forget to change your manager
pres circile mark
Lol He  Said Yes Man City Lol
well done mark. You're doing very well
Square for tackling?
“Get it off, that’s what she said”😂
Did not know how good manager career mode was until I tried it now I’m addicted
He is such a boomer lol
Hi mark im leon aged 9 like watching you on fifa and the united stand
Pogba is a cm not a cdm
Let's have fun doing... Nothing... Just watching him pley
Press O to tackle
I dont support Brentford but I play in the prem on fifa with them I've   Won 8 Drawn 5 Lost 7 what you guys think of this statistic...
tbh haaland will never go to united he will go to city
Who is watching because mark has not uploded
Mark use circle to tackle it works well Like so mark can see
Any one here when he is in the last season
It means that they are in the wrong poisin
The reason Brighton is the first fixture on Fifa 21 is because in real life, our first fixture WAS Brighton. But, for some reason, they changed it to Palace, instead of Brighton.
When I started career mode I bought ronaldo and messi on my first day
when u pass press triangle and tackling is r1 and o
6:50 "get it off thats what she said"

1:13:19 anyone notice him saying cmon city😂
looooooooooooooooooooool
The headed shots are also hard on fifa 21
United rule
I love you Mark, but you play Fifa like a boomer
1:13:16 he says come on Man City 😂
The maguire part 😂 1:06:35
There first game was actually meant to be Burnley
@manchesterunited
1:06:15 look at pogba
Am dude put legendary defending
To be honest I like the defending  more than FIFA 20
Why dont you just go to one button
Try a fake shot when your next to the keeper it make him dive then you have a open goal
His favourite feature is the press square on player to move them 🤣🤣 brilliant🤣🤣
The league fixtures not being the same is the most annoying thing ive ever experienced
He is a CDM
The medical rectangle interstingly fold because april perceptually program beyond a loving quit. assorted, groovy distributor

It came of everton player wasnt offside
Mark Goldbridge gets triggered at everything and everyone, man could win 1 Mil and complain he didn't get 2 Mil
Hamballs aren't in any fifa
34:16 ha
The explanation mark means someone is out of position and you change that by going onto squad hub, development and then click on him and go to position and then change him to a cdm
They do it because the covid kind of effecting when the league starts and other things. So they didn't follow the real fixture
Your CB needs to be over 80 on Defending Awareness
Haven't you watched any of the other YouTubers doing Career modes you should watch them first then do a career mode
You need to press square to change him to a CM
You need to do the training then to get A in all the trainings and to keep  the Sharpness and Fitness on green
Only started to watch recently and I always seem to make me laugh
how ironic is it that not long after the pickford tackle in this video, pickford wipes VVD out for 8 months in real life and gets away with it too lol?
Crossing and heading is pratty
Hi mate
4:42 Pogba isn't playing in his natural position which is CAM
Giving 81 to Cavani is a disgrace and clear showcase of lack of football knowledge. You see the likes of Ben Yedder, Aspas, Martial or Jimenez who all are 84 and Cavani is still better than any of them.
The refree is a joke in this game
21:42
intercept don't tackle mark
whats with all the jasus adds..................
“That is a stonewall penalty... watch Lingard”  Yeah bro... we watched Lingard and he was also offside!
This gameplay looks so robotic and horrible!
He should turn off competitive mode off , thats why they are doing many stupid skills on the pitch,
You remind me of Ole Solksjaer.
God it’s annoying listening to people try and explain competitor mode. It basically just simulates how a Fifa player plays instead of how the AI plays
Burnley
Do some skill inside the box and shoot. Why always trying to pass else trying to shoot in a angle where its impossible
I'm not sure how the new training system works but apparently you can train player's in different positions, so I would recommend training Shaw as a CB to replace the Fridge.
They’ve got random fixtures so it don’t get boring
Mark please make an squad update and make a new career mode. Cavani, Telles is there.
I swear I am dying from laughter 😂😂😂 he was saying POGBA WHAT IS WRONG WITH POGBA
1:13 he mark says come on man city ???
Exclamation point is for players out of position. If you want that formation. Just move the player position up or down alittle bit to get other positions. Example: cm position can be moved up for a cam or ram/lam position. Moved down for cdm. Takes away Exclamation point. Just play around with that with all positions to get rid of that. Sometimes you can't.
U need to get pelestri he signed on deadline day he’s a young player
Just saying but if pogba wants to play more on the attack side you can put the formation to 4-5-1 and have pogba amd Bruno up and behind martial and then Fred in the midfield spot
The best FIFA YouTuber
I've changed Pogba to a CAM on mine he's not a defensive player, also I fired the 4-2-3-1 off and play 4-3-3
Anyone looking forward to the red cards
Why does cavani not have a face in his picture?
My Burnley is scripted too. I conceded 6 to Burnley recently.
thankfully heading is a lot better in this game, it generally feels more realistic as well.  on the negative side ai marking is pretty poor....
Pellestri is on the game plz sign him he has great pottential
Ancelotti😂😂
1:15:09 what hell was that noise 😂😂
It's the bloody big shorts flec
So what is the difference between fifa20 and fifa21 ?
Will you buy sancho
No sancho
Greenwood's generic face is must worse in comparison to fifa 20. IMO
Why isn’t Cavani on fifa 21?
Use the Lb button for better dribbling. It’s class you knock it round people easy. Also flick the stick for off the ball runs after you’ve passed it.
Bruno, Alwys BRUNO  But let's not forget ITS ALWAYS BLOODY BURNLEY
Who’s watching just for a meltdown 😂 ( who’s rustling around in the background when Everton score?)
Love to see how he play against intermediate difficulty and still crying....
Mason needs a face scan 😂😂😂
If you believe that there’s no God and that nothing made the universe. Then if God is no-thing and therefore is nothing. Then can’t the universe come from him?  Also if you believe that the universe is infinite; then how is it that our bodies are part of the universe whilst our consciousness is also part of our bodies whilst our consciousness came into existence via our birth? This means that our consciousness is finite because it began, there for our bodies are finite and finally the universe MUST be finite...This is what Islam promotes...
Honestly the most entertaining youtuber
Goal keepers actually are programmed to not get penalties in fifa
32:07
I've subscribed to the channel you, hope you support your channel subscriptions with. thank
Omg the game looks the same wtf !!! I’m getting it tomorrow I hope it’s good man I already spent 65 bucks on it
The fact that Cavani isnt even in the game just shows how much of a waste of time he's probably going to be. f*cking no. 7 shirt WTAF
Competitor mode is where the opposition would do more skill moves and be more realistic attacking and defending.
52:00 sorry Mark, this is so funny to watch. even as a utd fan.
Bloody hell
You want a proper football experience where its not all ball rolls play PES
whats with all the youtube adverts - every 3 mins ...
Mark use 4-3-3(4) attacking formation. Then your players will play in thier correct position and their will not be any issues.
Lol what he done to his head!!!! Bang it against the wall 🤣🤣🤣
Will you be doing any ultimate team this year mark It was crap last year and it’s made some improvements
Change it from tactical to legacy in the controller settings that’s when your defending will get better
Hope you do well with your Career Mode with United mate!
Mark's wife now that the transfer window's closed: "I can't wait to finally spend some quality time with my husband!"  Mark now that the transfer window's closed: "I can't wait to start my Fifa 21 career mode!"
Bruh, mark as united manager gonna be better than the united stand clips Mark: "Out of position? well take one for the team pogba" "Maguire, slower than a bloody parachute" "Whose your daddy? Mason Greenwood!" "That's it, you foul him you donkey"
"BOL ROWL!!!"
Hello Mark, Fifa 21 has made alot of changes, aye
Pay attention to the offers for your players. You accepted Francis + cash for Romero. Looking forward to you shouting about the crap player who come from nowhere :DDD
You cant tackle because you have turned on Legacy defending which is the old controls. Turn it back so you can press B to tackle again
People in his comments on the live-streams are so thick it’s unreal
HELP: Mark PLAY DRILLS/TRAINING DAYS GET BETTER RATINGS IN A DRILL Like imagine you get a A-Rating in 1on1 defence or shiz you will get A every time you simulate that drill AND YOUR PLAYERS WILL GET A *Match Sharpness* but if you train players or like sim drills they'l get tired after a lot so ypu have to get *PLAYERS SHARPNESS TO 100/Green with a yellow to green stamina*
Brighton had lamptey at CB. Yup not buying the game
It there a no fan’s mode
Why’s Greenwood still not got his own face?
"I gotta improve my defending" - welcome to Fifa 19/20/21 where the AI cannot defend.
mark its Pogba Playing position lol !!!!
You should turn strict transfers on for realism(glazers)
49:46 losing 3-2 so brings on Lingard that is Ole style management right there
Have a great day ❤️
it so realistic that maguire is marking bailly jajaja
Mark l think the schedule is a bit different because of the schedule of the 2020/21 season and Covid. Which might interfere with next season. Hope this helps.
You’re gonna have a lot of losses if you don’t train and get your player sharpness up Marky boy😂
1:06:14 pogba gone flying
Haha mark can u get thiago n grealish in the team.
How do you manage only 27% possession against the computer
Rashford getting battered @1:06:15
How to cope with International Break depression
Excited for this mark 💪🏼
FIFA 21 looks dreadful
defending is much easier if you back off and hold your defensive shape rather than diving in, force them to make the mistake (like a heavy touch or a bad pass) then quickly take the ball and you should be fine.
No matter what happens rain or shine, Burnley most collect their points Goldbridge.
Pellistri is already on Fifa? So why make him
Are we not going to talk about how bad greenwood looks 😂 he lools like Wes Brown 😂😂
Why do the colours look less vibrant and lighting looks darker
Do a PES career mode with manchester united ! GGMU!!
double click r1 to beat a man it’s over powered
Quality video mate
Cant believe some one trolled him into thinking "dynamic weather" exists :D
Play pes 21 career mode
LESSSS GOO
Burnley is here you forget 😂😂😂😂
Mark was the stupidest person ever trying to find out matic has a injury marker over his head
Fifa are so lazy. Looks more like mbappe than greenwood lmao
Why not play 4-4-1-1 and have Pogba in CM rather than CDM?
Next career mode: Road to Glory with one of the new teams, either Barrow or Harrogate
I like ya cut g
Brighton had 72% Possession against him haha
*Can’t get ball off Brighton, very realistic* - Mark
Lmao *take one for the team Pogba* this is basically his career at man utd so far
Greenwood looks like Mbappe. and Mbappe looks like Greenwood in this game oddly enough.
can’t wait to get this game on Friday mate big fan of Manchester United
Mark on trending u live to c it🙌💪
Was it harry maguire? Yes! The turning of a fridge !😂😂😂😂😂😂
When Cavani and Pellestri get added to Uniteds squad on FIFA you might have to update the squads and start again or they won’t be in the game
I’m getting tired of fifa rolling out every year with MINIMUM improvement just to cash in every year😂😂
Looks nothing like greenwood which is a shame
I think fifa thought cavani was going to retire this season
Tackling is harder.. but hold down L2 it makes it easier
There are handballs. You gotta turn them on in settings
Wait what? 1:13:17
Signed
Will u please buy sancho. There is too much of these talks and i just wanna see sancho digned
Strawberry Neskuik, fish cakes and career mode with Goldbridge
Players look too small..can u zoom the camera angle??🙏
Marks back and telling people to brush their teeth
BURNLEY 😂
play amoung us with united stand members
To many ads.
In January can you sign Lamptey as backup RB
Cavani's shorts
Mark if u want them to stop doing skill moves and just turning u then turn of competetor mode
Something wrong with Greenwood’s face
Play it safe when the transfer open’s
You can turn handballs on
Game is trash its sluggish the AI cant defend and always out of position especially the back line.  Hopefully they fix it with updates
The more you train them the sharper they are
lol "bog off with your ball roll"... competitor mode? Why are you listening to the pushy little fifa prats in the chat?
Isn't there any real dialogues spoken during interviews or negotiations ?
fifa 21 looks more heavy and slow. weird..
How to press R3 can someone please help
Mark Hasn't won against Burnley in 2020
Competitor mode makes the AI behave more like a FIFA player and spam skills and basically be a sweat. While Legendary and Ultimate are supposed to be more like a simulation where the players behave more like IRL. People saying competitor mode is "more realistic" are talking out there bum. Unless they think that teams in real life are setting up to spam elasticos like Tekkz.
FIFA 21 is a combination of Football Manager and Top Eleven. Shambles
Play Shaw as left centerback
All you have to do is jockey mate to defend
Just shows Man United's Transfer Business was Panic Buys... Woodward couldn't even find Cavani on FIFA 21
If you want realistic gameplay that mimics real life play pes
Glad this is back ❤️
That training thing is just the new system for player potential growth. instead of having 5 focused sessions I believe it’s for your entire first team sheet. I always sim it because doing the sessions is just repetitive and the results are majorly beneficial. Although I love the new change position feature. I’ve mad Martial a CAM. Pogba and Bruno CMs. Sancho a RW and Rashford a LW with Ronaldo upfront. Also made Scott and AWB a CB for the bants
use bailly n lindelof  the pace is a saviour
Not gonna lie, that manager looked like me xD
Atleast you can make Brandon a RB
Burnley are back 👀😂
If you restart this on Friday, there should be an update that updates the players on all teams. So the real cavani would be on the team as well as the rest of the new signings.
With training play them till you get them an A and everytime you sim them after getting it rated A you will get A
You cant turn v.a.r on dont be stupid ...(got me)  🤣🤣🤣
Will you restart this when it's patched and Cavani is actually in the game properly?
Pogbas hairstyle has been the same the past 3 or 4 fifas, and they still haven't sorted Greenwood out😂
Set it to legacy defending👌🏼 it should help make it a bit easier🤞🏼Good luck with the rest of your career mode mate👍🏼
What’s wrong with Greenwood’s face?9:30😳😳😳😳😳😳
19:20 clothesline of a tackle 😂😂😂 classic fifa absolute prats
The game doesn’t come out till Friday for everyone! Apparently EA will fix that by the Friday.
Hahahaha love the intro I’m not even going to go in, enjoy your break 😂😂😂
Crossing and headers are so much better which I know you enjoy Mark !!! Enjoyed the video
If you have competitor on it makes the AI do All the fancy flicks and skills suggest you turn it off cuz no offense ur not the greatest at fifa
1:06:15 anyone else notice Pogba (I think) just randomly go flying? 😂
1:09:39 another year of moaning and blaming the game and viewers 😂
Finesse shots are overpowered this year. Every chance you have with a player with good curve and shot power or the finesse shot trait shoot a finesse shot
Markk can you train mengi pleaee he do got pace in the game
What number is Telles
How does Greenwood still not have a realistic game face?
Change Brandon Williams to a Right Back
Bloody burnley!
1:07:35  Mark you have to press circle, you can't just run into players anymore... You have to actually press tackle
Pellistri has a really good potential , goes from 71 to 87
ULTIMATE TEAM PLEASE😂
Buy Jadon Sancho
Mark: I'll have to finish this Aston Villa career in a week Also Mark: Vanishes from fifa 20 for a week  Nah only shitting with you fam, I'm just keen for any content mad love
*I do not know if you noticed Mark but the AI on legendary never crosses the ball and they pass like prime Barcelona regardless the team that the AI is playing.* *Now that is "realism" for you!*
Mark your previous career mode got me through lockdown. Wish I was working from home again so i could watch these live ! Legend
You can now set development plans and choose when ur players train and when they dont and stuff
Tackle had a power button, no jockey the man and press tackle at the right time, don't hold it or he'll only drag the man or lunge in
I’m so glad this series is back I’ve missed it more than I knew lol
Play a 4 3 3 attack
Fernandez hat trick without any penalties?  Least realistic fifa yet
They better add greenwoodd face into the  game, he looks ridiculous
Mark’s search engine is the chat he doesn’t search google anything
Tapping square whilst tackling gives the attacker more chance cus the tackle is weaker however holding square whilst tackling is a much stronger challenge... more chance of committing a foul however more chance you came away with the ball
54:08 Seeing Carlo Ancelotti with a skinhead literally has me in tears 😭😭😭
New FIFA, Same bloody Burnley.
He’s back the goat is back
1:06:19 watch pogba fly across the pitch!
Play the 4-3-3 with a holding midfielder and Bruno & pogba infront in 2 cams
I had a nightmare, Everton won the title this season
Close your eyes n hear this 52:23
AHH I STILL HAVE TO WAIT
21:37 "I was good at tackling on FIFA" must of forgot all the red cards he got including 3 in 1 game vs Arsenal
Yes it's about time you started so excited
Looks like Cavani wearing trousers lol 😂.
I Don't know what's worse... 1. Be Man Utd in any game!! 2. Have 4 conceded vs Burnley 3. Support Man Utd Fullstop ....or is it 4. Be From Nottingham & support a club 80 miles away Help me to understand.
Sign pellestri he is good
People like goldbridge are really gold and should be protected.Saviour and therapy for united fans
This is the best possible thing post transfer window
what does he streamez  on
Greenwood looks like a shaved coconut
Can’t wait for  this to unfold 😁 Goldbridge at the wheel  been buzzing for this
Is this gonna be everyday
FIFA 21 is not out until This Friday 😠🤬🤬
Mark SIM the season with recent transfer...let see
Move Pogba forward a bit then he is a CM, he is in line with Matic (CDM)
How many ads are needed 😅
You need to jockey more Mark your jumping in to quick
Good to see bruno looking like himself in game greenwood tho😬😬😬
What is his twitch
Cavani is not in the game what
Mark, sell Maguire
Can someone explain why Mark's Fifa looks just like Fifa 20 just with new kits? Even the menus are old Menus????
You should sign Mbappe he has a lot of potential
Mark use R1/RB + OB
You should sign sancho and upamecano
That's not me 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Try and get the other team to give u a penalty
get pellestri markkkk!
I like it when Mark gets pissed off and makes jokes 😂
No sancho but we’re having a parteyyyy
Circle doesn't work on legacy defending you must change back to tactical defending in order for circle tackling to be effective
Mark use R1 and flick the right stick in the direction you want them to run
Listen here Fleck im telling ya now...."GOLDBRIDGE IS NOT THE MAN TO TAKE US FORWARD...ABSOLUTE DISGRACE!!"
My first game was against Leeds. Thought that was strange my self. I signed sancho 🤣. That training is extremely annoying stopping every day takes ages to get to each game 🙄
Pogba has a low rating because you need to train him as a cdm
Put handball mode on
Mark if u play players in the wrong position their stats drop so u need to convert pogba to a cdm or u have change ur formation so he doesn't get a downgrade In stats
0:16 moms spaghetti
Buy Evan N'Dicka (21, L.C.B) from Eintracht Frankfurt in the transfer window.
Use Lindelof instead of Maguire and Buy David Aliba in January
Burnley coming back to haunt him 😂  Edit: Thx for all the likes. ❤️‍🔥🔥
“It’s always bloody Burnley” - Mark Goldbridge 2020
*Is there any kind soul getting the game that wouldn't mind gamesharing the game with me? i am a college student and dont really have the money to pay for the game you see, honestly if someone can help me out, i will let the complete challenges on me, give them shoutouts, whatver, peace and love*
Mark Pogba and Fred had red numbers because they are CMs and you played them in DM positions. In Fifa 21 if you play a player out of position it affects their rating and performances during games. You choose to play a 4231 maybe you could move Pogba more forward and leave Matic in that DM role when he comes back.
Mark, please turn competitor mode off. It makes the AI play like it's fifa street with tricks and flicks all the bloody time, sooo unrealistic. If you play stoke with competitor mode on, you'll think you're up against Messi, Neymar and suarez! And in addition to that, it's so much harder to get the ball of them with competitor mode on cuz of the turns and all that bullshit
Mark to get pogba playing in the right position press square on him then press CM. Like so he can see!
Ahh, this is what I've been waiting for
Mark raid
You should learn how to edit your FIFA videos like s2g
Hello Mark, Fifa 21 has made alot of changes, - Competitor Mode [ AI will use skill moves more frequently/Game will be harder ] - Development Plans [ The players now will not increase OVR via training, instead it’s automatic, you have different development plans for different players, and you can now change players positions, out of position players will decrease in overall, hell mark you can even change phil jones to cdm, but some players ( most probably players over 27 ) are unable to change since they’re too old, and it will say “ N/A “ ] - Training [ Now training is for match sharpness, less match sharpness will result in decrease of OVR, play the drill at least once to guarantee A everytime, if you only simulate it, it will give you D’s only ]  - Swap deals + cash is way more frequent this fifa  - There are alot more new features that i cant explain properly such as the double triangle tap, so watch ChesnoidGaming for more in depth info
