I love it James Maddison is the only one that’s turned up not dressed in England kit😂

57 years and counting......
So Now we get them arriving..Absolutely Pathetic..Wa nkers
Ramsdale with the tea 😂I don't blame him lol, tea hits kinda different abroad. Why are England arrival vids so enjoyable lol
Player football so special in everywhere country
The weather though 😂
Angleterre
6:00 12:00 13:23

Useless overpaid pansies. UK female footballers totally outshine them
Is that girl a physio?
My England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿❤️❤️
They needn't have bothered
I want to see Rice's suitcase right now.
Goodbye England, back to the lobby
What can I say! Even a 5 year old could of got that in the Goal Harry Kane 😅 The women deserve the men’s money!
Trent looked happy to be there miserable git 😮
I love you England ❤❤❤
bro the chill with England footballers!
I know Ben White had a family emergency and I hope everything is OK but I'm gutted for him as well. He's young enough to get plenty more chances
Nice to see you all happy my friends
Who else just guessed that’s foden sure😂😂

#ThreeLions! 👏
Bring in Mourinho as 3 Lions coach and you will walk away with the 2026 world cup. You have one of the strongest leagues, some of the greatest players the world has ever had, but you luck the coach who can steer you into victory. Remember, no English coach has ever won EPL; that already speaks volume in regards to the coaching talent in your country. I am not a hater, but a concerned fan
How come everyone is so handsome
While the controversy over LGBT rights continues English fans in their fights with Welsh fans once again showing the World their usual behaviours that comes with a civilised society.
love you...

Trent has some bad attitude man
we not gonna talk about the guy going thru sakas drawstring bag?
Did bukayo came in with arsenal bag???  😂
Why only German cars only seen 1 Volvo.
Second best arrival video 🤣👇 https://youtu.be/IdTCO6p9p9U
In the most corrupt tournment in history, even England can win something honestly 💩
Where’s Greenwood
It's cooming hooome 🔥💥🔥💥🔥
So you kneel down like muppets while living in the most privileged Nation in the world that is most definitely NOT a Racist Nation ......, but happily travel to Qatar? You are all disgusting hypocrites.
The fact that when Jude bellingham and alexandrer arnold come in its the most replayed one 😂😂 people really have a crush on them
At least this time they're carrying their luggage themselves (mostly) 🙈
My CONGRATULATIONS FOR ENGLAND 6:2 WIN THE IRAN THIS STRONG START ON THE WORLD CUP WONDERFUL VICTORY ENGLAND I LOVE YOU FOREVER 💖😎😎😎😎👍👍👍👍👍👍👍❣️❣️❣️👍🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥✌️🙏🙏💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪😎🙏👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Callum Wilson over Ivan Toney 😂 joke
Sein lachen süs oooh was für auto wekomm hotel hilton lachen bitte achtung camera bitte lachen
See you all next week on your way home lads. Bunch of virtue signalling hypocrites. I'm English and I won't be watching 1 minute of it if it's possible. Using sports to push unnatural agendas is a big no no.
This life is a race. In this life, i have to race against myself
hi ae
What are the girls doing.? What’s their role. Do they just greet the footballers as they arrive??  Or do you mange them.  Does anyone know? Thanks
Why can’t they all come on one ride 😂
Are they arriving at a group house? How come they travelled separately. I don't understand this video.
Jack Grealish fans here 👇 Hits Like👍
hi ae
Pov:you are Irish buy clicked on this vid for no reason
Trent had a right mard on 😂
@4.33 Gunners 🔴⚪🥇4 EVA
I wonder when England misses penalty and those are Saka Rashford and Sancho 😂 are they going to treat them like animals
I Can Guess When Harry Kane Arrived 😂
Trent has a bad attitude
5:55 you just can’t not smile when you have Bukayo in front of you
Who else likes these knap sacks
My boy Saka arriving with an Arsenal bag that’s cool
Dellusional brits, the reality check will come strong for them. Brazil's Sixth star is a reality, sorry bri'ish.
I can smell the testosterone. Superb set of lads 🏆
I’m English and I haven’t supported the England football team since about 2006, hopefully they lose every match
There seems to be more humility with this generation of players.  I hope I’m right.

all arriving in different cars - why couldn't they pick a few players up in each one
Southgate didn’t even give madders an England tracksuit 😂😂😂
14.30 player of the tournament arriving
How did grealish make it and not sancho
I just love Maddison... his style is really unique hope one I'll play with him
4:31 all homies dream
No one going to talk about Dier's blue beanie??
Come arrivate ve ne tornerete presto a casa con le vostre bandierine
We all know at least 5 of them Shouldn't even be there. Southgate out
Without Haaland, team England cannot even pass the group stage.
Feels good seeing Madison 😁
Is that Car or some kinda tractor.... It's sound sucks 🤥
The clap at 4:31 with Saka and Benny Blanco is so satisfying.

Is Trent okay
Let's Hear You Scream for the England Team - Grit Cutter ft MC Lukmium | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYmCKvpw4sU
English through and through!!England not get any chance in winning World Cup!
Love Walker’s comment to Saka “you guys gonna stop winning?” 🤣 great to see the Arsenal boys in the England camp after the flying start to the season
Didn’t like Trent’s arrival, full of attitude and can now see why Southgate had left him out in the past.
How are these England players these guys are black
I’m American but I watch mostly Team England players 😂
Hary miugere 😁
Harry mirguire haha no chance delued
They've gotten the royal treatment! wow I hope they enjoy these coming weeks
Three of 9 lions Welcome to qatar
Is it me or there's something weirdly satisfying and special about Jackie Grealish LATE different arrival?! 😊😊
Anyone tell me why they want every players passports 🙏🏻
Go yard bags galore
Women is really gorgues❤️. I Miss Ivan Toney
Rashford swag is a peng
England needs to ditch UK/Scottish blue and the UK anthem. Red and white are our colours 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 and our anthem should be distinctly about England alone https://youtu.be/TW9Z8PSPFFM
Saka stand up for everyone 👌👌👌
SAKA 💥💥
I want that jacket what rashford has on but can’t find it anywhere!!!!😢😢😢😢
Hope to win the English team is my support team I am an Indonesian, Melanesian child🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿😇❤️🙏
For everyone thinking it’s coming home it’s not😂
Scam
Did each player fly in separate planes too?
its so hard to contain this hype, this world cup is needed by everyone in the world....TIME TO FORGET THE PROBLEMS AND LOVE THE BEST SPORT IN THE WORLD!!!!!
Rashford is a real football celebrity. He nailed his outfit 🙏👋
They got No change anyway. Come on Wales
Saka’s Arsenal bag😍😍
where's trent?
Dier with the mate set! I liked him already but now… 🙌🏼🙌🏼

I'm a Kenyan supporting 🇬🇧 for 2022 Qatar world cup
England team has an amazing technical team and players
Im a United fan....but i do love Saka....tbh  Nd i feel gud seeing him in this world squad (expected tho)
Saka & Benny Blanco..proud of our two boys. Arsenal in the Building.
Gutted Reece James isn’t there 😢
there is a rumor that most english players are comedians, is that true?
Rice getting out of the car with his backpack on like he's off to school😂
Henderson the racist guy
Maddison has to start every matches for sure. He's their main playmaker and he's better than Mount and I'm a Chelsea supporter.
Why Trent is sad?
Haha Qatar can you host England hmm... They like drinking ooo
Anyone know what  backpack Ben White (and some of the other english players) are carrying?
Why is she taking thier passports any explanation plssss
The Geordie driver saying “come back safe and sound” to Wilson and Trippier was so wholesome
How is Marcus Edwards not going to the WC 🤣
Come on England 🤗🤗
Pickford didn't get a new tracky in the post
I love how they always bring their boots in their club bags
Harry Kane with the fresh low air forces
Why do they have to hand in their passports
England squad has the best players arrivals video there is
Who is the girl that gets the passports!?
Watch footballers as they arrived for the world cup, the excitement in their face is like , " you made it".   It's like ," welcome into my father's kingdom, you that is faithful servant "
Best link up
One car per person?
I wish England gets knocked out first of all of the teams competing 😂
why don't they carpool? what a waste of gass
Ask Trent if he’s alright🥲
Who else is wondering why Trent seems so down
These guys are treated like VIPs... individual cars, all those handshakes like they are all family 🤣🤣🤣 need to stop coddling these people...this is why England will never amount to anything. Hopefully there's more handshakes as the immediately get dropped out of the world Cup
Arsenal players move different 🔥🔥
Ben white best budy for sure 🔥✌🏼
someone needs to record the camera man arriving
Who is that girl staff name ?
Usa usa usa usa usa 🇺🇸!!!!!
What happened to Trent tho why did he look a bit sad when he entered
And they don't care about those who died building the stadiums, what overpaid hypocrits.
the moment maguire came i bursted out laughing🤣
Benny Blanco and saka♥️
مرحبا وهلا بالفريق الانجليزى وجمهوره الرائع بالنجاح والتوفيق
English/England gives me the boak
England will not pass group stage
Why did Kane come out of the van like that 😂😂😂
Pickford can;t even get out of a car quietly :D
Trent looks happy to be there...
Lovely
Bukayo is moving to Qatar 😃⚽
i like how they all had team bags(as in bags with the logo of the team they play for) well a lot of them
What a lovely weather 😁😁 No sterling why? 😭 Next behind the seen video can't wait 😁👍👍👍
Gutted about Tomori when were taking Coady, Dier and Maguire 🤦‍♂😒 Ivan Toney most inform striker should oof gone as well!
Can you broadcast all matches of England play?? 😁👍👍👍 live match 😁
Boykott Qatar
Shoe ID on henderson???
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I love England you are welcome 🙏 Doha Qatar
Haa these guys seems like they don't vibe at all just the attitude by Arnold
Can we just appreciate that connection on the saka and Ben white greeting 👌👌😊
Best wishes guys
Wholesome
Girl name?
Saka has got to be one of the most respectable players ❤️❤️❤️🫂
does anyone have that girl´s instagram? I just want to give my passport to her
James Maddison 👍
Stones face when the door opens😂😂😂😂😂
Trent with a face like thunder, not even happy he is going to a World Cup
World cup proudly sponsored by modern day slavery 🤮

14:32 the Boogeyman
BK-BK-BK-BK-BK-BK
Who else was looking forward to Harry Maguire
Harry Maguire being there is a joke.
I miss Sancho 😭
They all have the same backpack
I like the girl collecting the passports
Where is Mahrez?
Trent looks unhappy
Came on inggris
9:50 The real captain of England
come on England, prove you are the world's best league retainer, to bring this year's world champion in qatar.
ARNOLDS FACE LOL
Best of luck guys from Cambodian supporter. It's Coming Home!!
Greenwood miss out so sad
I believe we can win
Rooting for England to do well this tournament! Love from an Australian born Korean.
everyone is fine except for TAA i hate that guy idk why cant he smile?
Everytime I watch Mase off the pitch, I just love him more and more
Full support team England...... From Northeast lndia.....
They didn’t even let Maguire walk through the door before they cut him off 😅😂
Can't wait can't wait can't wait...
Mason has a Chelsea bag 💙

Nice hat bro…😆
When is the first match and where can I see it on android??
I didn't see Marcus Rashford...

What a misery Trent is
I'm excited I'm counting days for the date 😱
So sad for Sancho, he should have included
Can anyone tell which brand bagpacks Declan rice ben white are wearing
congrats wilson!🎉
"Forecast" ENGLAND Champion FIFA WORLD CUP In Qatar 2022👍👍👍
Sotget kaya kirik.
Can anyone tell me the girl's name?
Poor trent
the islamic hating racist are here
USA WILL BEAT ENGLAND 🇺🇸
Mounts smile is infectious ngl hahaha, what a lad
Am so happy for Kelvin phillips
They skipped Maguire's greeting?!
Is dier going fishing
Maguire is the best!
Most likeable group of England players ever.
They will never ever win another tournament. The curse can't be broken!
This is the first time I saw Trent smile in a England video this year
If there’s anyone that can win england this World Cup it’s Jude Bellingham
Sorry but why is Coady in the team instead of Tomori 😤
why bring Harry Maguire? Need someone to eat left over? England is doomed.
Trent still in Anfield mood, can see the rivalry handshake
The red and blue handshake of Kyle and Luke
I’m sittning here, just waiting for Lindgard and Rashford to show up 😢
England squad back pack game is strong ... Go yard, Louie, Burberry, Dior 😍 jheeez
4:37 why did I find this arrival hilarious
England couldn't win the world cup during the time of Beckham, Rooney, Ferdinand, Lampard, Gerard and so on...let alone with these boys.
Never seen a more boring set of personalities in my life
Jack getting dropped off by Tommy Shelby 🤷🏻‍♂️ Black Country routes running strong 🤣
Great video.  This is also an awesome video about topplayers who will make their WC debut https://youtu.be/1ADVtS8UP1I
Why was Trent so sad bruh 💀😭
Am just actually happy to see Mason mount
Bunch of woke cretins have if you really wanted to make a statement then don’t turn up.
She’d hold it
3 Lions let's go 🥰💪
I really hope England team can just focus on football now instead of trying to focus on getting Qatar’s law or culture change.  We don’t allow other religions or culture to change British way of life so how do we expect that other countries should change their way of life because we don’t agree with it.
Come on Wales😁😍 Old family War there
Plz bhai
Mera channel Ak fortuner lover  2728
Anyone else wonder why some players eg. Dier, Rashford, Pickford aren't wearing the new trackies while others are? Also, surely some players live in the same neighbourhood if they play for the same club eg. Gallagher and Mount, Ramsdale and Saka, so how come they don't arrive together?🤔
Make all the foxes back home proud Maddison 💙💙
BET SHES BEEN RUN THROUGH SOOOOO MANY TIMES 😂
Yeh theyl be departing just as quick lol
Was it me or did that first car have like a engine knock
Trent looked exhausted
Foden will make a history for sure!
Why camera don't show up maguire much
Certificate of participation 😂😂
Where is sterling guys
I wanna see Pickford face when Harry Maguire arrived 😂
I was waiting patiently for Harry maguires arrival You could see the passion in his eyes It’s coming home lads🎉
Trent looks like an outsider walking into that group there,,maybe I’m totally wrong it’s just a vibe I picked up compared to the other players,,or is Trent the genuine one and it’s the others playing up for the camera 😂😂😂 who knows lol
England have the players to win this World Cup but won’t because imo Southgate is way too negative and doesn’t let those players play with freedom..it’s only an opinion but I fully believe under a different approach this group of players could really be special
How can you not love Bukayo Saka!!
Mighty mase what a man
All this to get pumped 3-0 by USA
My favorites to win the world cup
Not an Arsenal or England fan but Saka and Jude are such ballers. Goodluck...
Eric Dier looking like the newest member of the Wet Bandits
Three Lion is Champion 🏆
All rivalries to be set aside for me - these are NOW my players for the next month! Come on England!!
i saw trophies then my vision went pitch black when i saw Kane
FODEN brother
There is something wrong
But nextdoor of UNHCR finde me there
You will never walke alone
Walker said to saka can you lot stop winning
But i don't have any idea to come there but am wealling to be there
I love you guys so much but don't leasen what those are talking but believe your selfes
Hi bro
🦵
Keep training day and night you will get but without talent and harde worke ball experience you must copy your's formation ok am supposed to be honest with the lion not the 🐈
Gunners
😺🙀💌💪🤏🤝
Lets get the party started boys... make it a goal galore #cmonengland #topbins #bringithome #putthemontoast
Aye ayeee Shawberto Carlos is back
Never loose the hope of lions
Hi lions
Arrival videos are very interesting as the people in it are very hopeful and oblivious of the result of the tournament
Was it necessary to have the boys arrive in separate vehicles instead of a bus?
Pampered, but never won a thing, where is the real hunger for success in National representative football?
What a plonker Declan Rice is… kissed the Ireland badge and sang IRA songs
Looking sharp there boys.
Some of these players should learn from Brazilan natonal team how to greet someone,Saka is gonna grow into a gentleman pure class.
Walker telling Saka they gotta stop winning is gold 😂😂
Whole lotta goyard bag😂😂
Yess q
Why Trent Arnold is grumpy ? Great content though. popped up on my feed. Watching from Morocco :)
Let’s go England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 👏👏👏👏
trent looking like he doesn't want to be there
Why Maguire only have  3 seconds? Cameraman  doesn't like him?
14:29 the arrival of the best CB in England🔥🔥🔥
How sad. ESR was supposed to be part of this...
The guys saying to every player “welcome to the World Cup” was cringe 😂
Dont bother unpacking lads...you'll have enough time to kneel and you'll be coming home. Usual BS
Coady should be going on national competitions even when he retires.That positive energy does a lot more than we think
Made for Madisson🎉 and Starboy Saka
i like the players who are her3 to play not the players who like to look pretty and act like divas
No virtue signalling rainbow armbands on display lad’s 🤔
I wish the "Three Lions" all the best!
Aah why are they coming  in the same car
Our fucken time. Let’s bring it home boys.
Arsenal❤
what’s with the club bag?
where is jadon sancho
Shabby entrance should be wearing suits
Anyone wanna think about building a ramp?
Dier' boot cover from club is immediately taken care of
14:30 🐐
Best of luck bring it home.
Ready to get knocked out by Denmark, no diving for Sterling this time
What is that fog though? Is that normal for England? Wild!
I see Conor Coady, I smile.
Why they cut Harry like that 🤣
I'm happy to see anode in the squad
Love for Saka he always stood up when greetings 💓💓💓
When I see Foden, I kind of miss Greenhood.
Looking forward to the "lads" not winning again. Always makes my WC special 😂😂😂😂
Group stage exit
felicitaciones
Maddison pulling up in the Volvo 🔥🔥🔥😂😂
Another holiday without the souvenirs.....
What depressing weather!!!! :)
Losing to the USA unfortunately
Best of three line team
Best of luck bring it home!!
Y’all better win. I bet a $100 on y’all 😞
2:56 my main man.
No faith in Southgate. Tactically clueless and his team selections are terrible- evidenced by half the selections he has made for the World Cup.
the next world cup champion, save tweet
Jamaicans 😂 Always have to be the last ones to arrive 😂😂😂 it’s just in our nature yaa man affi just a custom to it.. But yes mates we bring that 🏆 back home lads.
Yuck
mason with his chelsea bag and saka with his arsenal bag like it's so cuteeee
Wishing the lions the best of luck in the world cup 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 🦁🦁🦁
I k Google.se
💔😊👍
England will win 🏆
great to see the arsenal direct bag with the arsenal players
Hope England get knocked out in the Group stage for the Vile way your digustung media is trying to ruin the GOAT CR7'S reputation. England is a disgusting country and wont win the world cup due to dishonest media reporting of the GOAT. I feel CR7 will have another last laugh after Portugal hopefully dismantles you lot.
Looking for Starboy Harry Maguire
Ramsdale and White both need to start
My boy maddison..🥲🥲🔥🔥🦊🦊
Where’s raheem 😂
Can we call them Lions or is it now Lionessesthey?  Englands LGBT supportive team will be back home soon.
Definitely, Coady, Mason, Rice, Bukayo, Grealish and Dier Bringing the vibes in the changing room
I always play guess who’s in the car as it pulls up, can proudly say I got 0/26 😂
#justiceforlauren ✊️
Maguire?
Can’t England sort out some gimbals for the lads recording? Would make a much smoother video 😂
Geordie Boys on tour cmon the lads
Love these player arrival vids saka ❤❤
Ivan toney robbed
Cool as out Dec's 😎😎😎
Football is the best
Ma name is Omar from Gambia ma second country gonna win 2022 World Cup 🙏👊
Dunno why - but I love these. Best bit: Trippier and Wilson 😁
Maseeee
Where’s Nick pope
I don’t know why I judge them on how they treat everyone coming in. Rashford wasn’t coming in top there haha Early morning lads
Group stage materials
Why does Eric Dier look like the villain from Home Alone
Why’s Trent always miserable asf I noticed it the last few months, maybe he’s going through a bad time at home but it’s cause for concern especially since his performances have been below par.
She's fine 😍
is it me or did sterling not appear
They’ve all pumped that blonde ent they
I think we'll not dissapoint if Maddison features...he's in awesome form and looks chuffed to be there...
Trent looks so confused 😂
Every single player, footage of arrival, out of the car, smiles, few daps, then inside for more of the same and 2-3 hugs......Maguire barely got out of the car before his footage ended. Ha ha.
I feel morally obliged to boycott this World Cup. I hope you consider the same.
Great preparation...a cold foggy English training camp for the sweaty hot desert of Qatar....teams usually have weeks of acclimatisation....
Bring Manchester united player to the WC is a big mistake come on Southgate are u blind bringing worst defender player harry maguire? And worst winger Sancho? 😭😭
Mason has got to be the sweetest human being… The door was barely open and I could him smiling already!!!
Benjamin (Saka’s voice ) is buzzing. Happy for the arsenals boyz
What a miserable man Trent is 🤦🏻
Who hired the side+ camera man? Great seeing trips and Wilson travelling together.
Its coming home ! 😳
lets get after it lads, this is the one!💪⚽💯
getting excited now!! YEAH MAN!!
Here we go lads this is it.  Its time to take it home this time
Missed these videos no idea why I enjoy them so much.
1:08 we gonna ignore the dap up Ben white got with the old dude
Saka with the “Nice hat bro” 😂
Love the sound of the car
Why didn’t they show Arnold’s car arrival
Saka is just soo respectable.
All for tax payers money.
Make the most of it.They will soon be home.
Why does Trent look so moody
Different feeling when harry kane e enters the building. It’s like the Don’s arrived
Harry Kane hand shake with Saka was bit awkward 😂😂
Not gonna lie no one was excited to see maguire
Pickford me eyes are to small…ya mean ya arms
Is that everyone? Yeah! *Sterling* 😮
Watching this arrivals footage is like watching a satisfying video compilation.
What’s does K. Walker says to Saka at 4:23 ?
Maguire even struggled getting out the cab 😂
Nice to see Wilson n trippier car pooling lol
Rashford letting the side down from the get go and not spudding the camera guy
madders!!!! 😭😭😭😭😭
Must have saka carried that Arsenal bag..?😂😂😂
Shame trips and Wilson didn’t throw a “play like Almiron” swipe at Grealish
I only know one type of lions and that's the four lions , Mashallah bruva!
Its sakas Benjamin for me
WHO IS THIS CAMMERMAN
what is her name ? !
What is Eric Dier carrying?
The atmosphere inside st gorges park is amazing I’ve been there once it’s one in a life time opportunity ❤GO ON ENGLAND
Daaaayum! My boy Kane rockin’ them low top AF1s! I knew there was a reason I liked this homie.
IM SO HAPPY
Mase
IT'S COMING HOMEEE!!!!!!🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
How dead does Trent want to look
Wake up . MBGA .
I'm a patriotic English man ,  that's why I don't support the English football team .   14
The Arsenal bag❤️
Justice for Tomori and Toney
Lovely !!
If this is Qatar they should be thoroughly ashamed of themselves. What about the slaves who died building the stadium? Human rights are non existent there
Saka arriving hold that Arsenal bag really makes my day. He must be proud of what they've done so far this season.
Whilst I support the England team in their journey, I will not be watching because I am boycotting this tournament because it is happening in Qatar. The Guardian estimates around 6,500 migrant workers have died in Qatar since the country won its bid to host the World Cup. Those who’ve survived have few rights, and live and work in squalid conditions for meagre pay. There are also serious concerns around the rights of women and LGBT people in Qatar. It is a vile country. #BoycottQatar
Welcome to Doha
The way Saka called “Benjamin!!!” 💯💯
They had to arrive one by one, why not they didn't come together?
That photographer thought of a line - 'welcome to the World Cup' - and wasn't afraid to use it
Rice easily is the most down to earth out of the squad
Let's hope England don't win a game.
14:28 this is why we're here
What’s in the envelope!!!😬
Bukayo showing up with the arsenal bag 😂😍
😋These boys are enjoying life I'm jealous. 🤪
The only way england wins this world come, is if they overwhelm other teams in attack.
trent😂
England🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿⚽️🤍
Reason I like Saka is his showing respect to the players
Goyard FC innit
Bellingham is the most overrated midfielder I've seen in time mad he gets in Englands 26
Last years final should never go to penalties, you either go for it and highly increase your chances to win the game or sit back and wait to draw/lose. Fans wouldn’t care if you lose the final in normal time but showed real attacking intent and desire to win. It’s the risks that are required to win big trophies, you will more often than not be rewarded. But keep on taking the cowards approach Mr Snoozegate.
Conor Coady seems like such a friendly guy
Who will win FIFA World Cup🏆⚽
Can someone tell me what they are bringing in them club shop bags?
Happy for James Madison. Hope England coach don't play 2 defensive mid fielders.
I always have the assumption that all pro athletes are arrogant but they all seem to come off as nice guys (besides TAA lol)
great group of players. would've loved to see Tomori tho
Respect to Madders for rocking up in a diesel Volvo 🤣
PORTUGAL 22!!!!
Keep the engines running on the "rainbow" plane cuz you guys wont be there long...
All these comments of praise for Saka make my heart sing and I’m not even an Arsenal supporter. He’s just a decent lad and it shows.
Yes Connor Gallagher from my home town
Trent looks happy 😂
England arrival videos szn is back
All of the players I saw were men. There’s no diversity. Where are all the women. Surely there’s a gender discrimination suit waiting to happen
Yes let's all clap for multimillionaires that take a knee for a drugged up criminal but are happy and smiling at the world cup that slavery built....
Love it. So proud to be English. Come on the boys bring it home.
Feels like when we’d come to school before a trip to another country- everyone in their own clothes with the odd muppet wearing the uniform 😭  Regardless, best of luck lads 🙏
Dier turns up looking like a homeless tramp..
How can you go to a world cup and still be so miserable...
FIFA Death Cup.
🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷
Southgate shouldn't have arrived.
That girls looking for a husband
Mason Mount seems so fun to be around!!!
Theyre gonna win the "Well Tried Cup" this time around.
Finally Maguire at last😂
TAA's got a bit of a grump on hasn't he?
I just smile when I saw Ben White ,saka and Ramsdale
I'm not From England .. but I'm one of the fan who love England and the players. let's go lads the world depend on you to back with the world cup 👏👍😍😍💥
"Keep the engine running lads, we won't be long."
I would have loved Ivan Toney to be in the squad, Southgate out.
So sad Dele Is not part of the team 😢
Saka can't leave his Arsenal bag at home 😂
Wo take da cup ... Cameroon
🇧🇭🇧🇭🇧🇭🇧🇭🇧🇭
Maddison🐐
TAA looks like he don’t even wanna be there and shouldn’t tbh
Here we go again . A 43 year old bloke getting the tummy flutters like a 7 year old on Christmas morning.  Come on boys , do us proud
Saka is the ultimate definition of humility.
Tripps and Wilson rocking up together, the mags man🔥
only like jack grealish to show up fashionably last
BELLINGHAM NEEDS TO START!  BUZZING ALSO FOR MADDERS.
So much talent gonna be wasted
England need some oil money to buy some better players
Sanchoo 😔😔😔
14:29 The king Harry Maguire....hallaluyah 🥲
FYI as an Irish lad watching these, it's so cool to see all the lads greeting each other. If this was the Ireland team, guarantee there'd be cans falling out of the cars and half of us turning up hungover wearing sunglasses.
0:59 two things, 1 - Ben White is way taller than I thought, 2 - trying to go for a sneaky kiss maybe???
Here for Kalvin Phillips
Trent looks so unhappy :(
SO happy 4 Saka, Callum & Ben
Of course Grealish & little man last.
England has the best arrivals.
They are three overrated chickens 😂
missing RJ
Did anyone get a Bro handshake count? Also - what’s with the giant purses as a backpack?
These claps are insane 🤣🤣
Loved this untill I saw harry mcdonalds
Real question is... who's the girl taking the passports? 👀👀
Mate the secretary on arrival is so peng what’s her IG?
This is the Premier league homecoming 😅
i love cody, so glad he’s on the plane, can keep the spirits high and is a solid backup if we need him, gels with anyone, proper leader 🦁🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Tripps and Wilson arriving together, so wholesome ❤️
trent looks happy
All the best lads...
Ben white looks like his over done it on the fake tan and threaded his eye brows to pencils
Does anyone see how awkwardly Grealish and Sterling greet each other hahaha🤣🤣Love this team though watching the players jell is so lovely to see honestly.
Tf is wrong with Trent
Millionaire's club
If this team makes it outta group confrimed fifa is rigged
Why they turning up individually?
I love this video ❤
14:26 bring in the corpse black funeral car really suits this dead meat... honestly i thought he would take the backdoor
5:40 Deli Ali enters the building ..honestly i wonder who would be worse arnold or Ali
3:50 why do this remind me of grid girls.. do she have some other purpose then be  beautiful and greeting the players ..is this really the 2022 world cup feels more like 1980 world cup
I didn’t see Rambo
https://youtube.com/shorts/U6BtYcO1WJg?feature=share
No one like our boy saka🙏
I love England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 football very much   Plz.   Win fifia world cup 2022🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🔥
I was just waiting for Mase! He always has a big smile on his face! He just oozes positivity
Dear world cup don't injure Bukayo Saka thank yo very important
Keep those engines running....England getting knocked out faaast😅
So much disrespect and disregard for other countries beliefs. I've not wanted a team lose so badly than this double standard England team. Hope kane snaps his leg.
They all love Philips! He’s just so sweet
Come on boys
4:06 I’m so here for the Saka, Shaw and Grealish friendship! Saka is the most genuine, respectful and humble guy! The way he stands up to greet his teammates…respect!
Connor Coady the most likeable. So down to earth 🙌🏾
Find it strange more of them don't ever travel together
Always beautiful to watch 😍.... Saka is also so respectfully and calm.
Brave of Jude to turn up to the England camp with a bag covered in german writing! 😅
Could anybody direct me to where I can buy this exact hoodie worn by the players?
This maybe the best world cup ever.. we get to see new faces of players, new talents, mixing with some players who announced that this is their last world cup will bring the best performances..
Come On England ⚪🔴 Supporter from INA 🔴⚪
I’m gonna be on tv on the 18 for children in need and mason was there
Saka is so respectable to everyone 😅. I love him
Loved How the Arsenal boys carry the Club Bag , expect off course Benjamin white , who doesn't even wear the England track :D
Great stuff by Henderson, strutting in in his pair of Yeezys.....not that Id expect better from and LFC clown, but talk about tone def......what an idiot :-)
Coady
No one's talking about dier he respects
Going to Qatar only to loose & come back early🤣
It is hard to like that mouth breather Kane.
World best video 😯 📹 👏 https://youtu.be/dFGT6njLVSU
For whatever reason , Trent Alexander-Arnold came with an annoying face 😑 ..
Dier drinks mate?
Why aren't they arriving in Bentleys but Mercedes?
Ya'll better win the trophy
Saka seems so humble. Greeted everyone.
Maddison the first one to arrive. You can tell he's buzzing. Can't wait to see him get a chance to prove himself.
what a squad  man 😇😇😇😇

USA fan here its always nice to see other nations prepping up for the WC. this is super cool
the amount of weapons we have is rediculous more or less the same as the golden generation the only difference is this lot are better managed we got every chance of winning this no better time than now or in the next 4 years
I hope they  don't catch Covid after all these hogging and kissing !
Like kids on Christmas morning... it's the pinnacle the wc... it's the chance at greatness
First in first out!
Haaland ??
BEST INT FOOTBALL YT CHNL
England yes, maguire southgate no❌
Lol maguire
That is a crazy talented team!
We want world cup
Benny Blanco be like, "where are we going?"
I'm a England big fan from Indonesia 🇲🇨 Expect victory 🏆
A girls sport.
Bring it home, lads
Let's go boys
If your country isn't in the WC, let's gather over here👏👏🥳🥳say your football chant here: "grenadye alaso"
waited this whole video just to see wilson trippier and pope 😍😍❤️🖤🤍🖤🤍
cant help but love these even as an american
I see England is still in need of skilled barbers.
Let's see if you guys can beat Iran easily or else.
U guys went to Qatar for party not to bring the trophy home
Bring it home lads
Who the girl who meets & greets the players?
Respect to Dier, Wilson,tripper & Henderson, only 1s who thanked their chauffeurs for helping with the  🧳
Bellingham is such beast.
As someone who grew up when a simple handshake sufficed, all this man hugging is nothing short of pathetic!
The respect Trent commands when he walks in is actually insane. Everyone knows he’s the truth when he walks in.
Coady and Saka just seem like the nicest people.
Fair play to that coach who got a clean connection with every player
Fair play to that coach who got a clean connection with every player
Love the old fashioned handshakes by Dier
I think everyone needs to be as gassed as Rice 😂
Please may I have my car back now , u said u was nipping out 3 week ago ☝️😅😅😅 come on England!!!!! 🇬🇧
Unbelievable professionalism by saka when Walker was making a joke about the league and he ends the convo there and says ‘don’t worry about that,we’re here now’
I don’t think this group they will go far this time may be round 16 max
What is the name of the girl who collects their passports?
I love these videos so much and seeing how united they all seem.
Some of those connections on the greetings😮‍💨
All there backpacks are worth over. 2000 pounds. Goyard lv gucci. Would be cool but they all have the same ones so a north face one would actually be unique for once
here for the Dior rucksacks and expensive bags
That one guy saying Welcome to the world Cup to every player 😂
jude’s gonna shine in this tournament
This guy Trent just looks so out of it at this point.. man showing no level of excitement, no smile. What’s the problem with my guy? 😢
saka needs to be in a liverpool shirt with jude
bring it home
Does anyone knows what they do with the iPad when they arrive
Mount dragged chelsea to Qatar 🤣
Sterling looks done 😂. Too much chelsea does that to ya.  Im a chelsea fan too.
Most English football fans of clubs either avoid or don't realise the world cup is the most important, the most prestigious, the absolute pinnacle of football. I have booked off from work the 20th of November till the 6th of December to watch the World Cup. That was the full amount of my holidays. Come on England.
When are the WAG`s arriving?
Seeing Marcus back with the squad makes me so happy. Hope he has a banging world cup with scoring goals and all that.
The video we’ve all been waiting for 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿⚽️
a study on high end canvas backpacks
I am a united fan but ,Saka's African roots showed up and showed out which is Respect for every Human being . What a lad!! TAA on the other hand😠
Noting but pure positive vibes from Rice he called it its coming home!! Southgate needs to play them in there inform positions we win 🥳
Come on, england...
are they arrived in Qatar
Tomori not being there is disgraceful
5:39 trent
My country didn’t qualify for the WC so I’m just going to chill here at the England channel, so fun to watch when you’re also a massive Prem fan 👌🏼
Mate shes fit
So gutted Ivan toney ain't there
Dier out here with a Spurs bag. Lol. And so it begins...
After all british government and fa did to abramovic and chelsea this is the payback time. Highest place for you guy's will be round of 16 and the whole country will cover their face in shame. #KARMAAWAIT
Imagine England winning the world cup
I’m so happy for Rashford
Welcome back home bois the world cup is not you yet and this world cub is the boy boys game not little boy level
It's sad despite the amazing talent England have got Southgate is going to put shackles on the team and park the bus with a back 7. This will hold England back.
grealish and sterlings dap is the most awkward thing hahhaah
trent looks so awkward
My boy Saka still repping Arsenal there he loves our club a lot…Man City and co stay far away
I see what ya'll did with Maguire's Screen time
WHERE IS MR. MAGUIRE??
I just watched an 18 minute video of guys getting out of cars and handing out their passports 😂😂🤣
Pickford is too jokes
Harry Kane is such a bus that he arrived in a bus 😂
Eric Dier got that drip
These arrival videos are always the best
14:30 best moment of the video seeing Maguire I was so happy
Saka is pure class 🔥🔥🔥
I love this video so much especially seeing my guys..... cmon city let's help England win this, also I'm proud to see my brother Bukayo i will definitely give my support to this English team. Make epl proud this time pls no dull moment. I've been supporting England for a long time
Rashyyy😍😍
love the u.k...love fog
Who else here mainly for Saka, White & Ramsdale??? Also am not a English fan but am loving the vibes there💯👍💯👍💯👍 An it's clear only Southgate needed Maguire cause they only show him for about 3 seconds 😅😂😅
Who’s the blonde
Toney is the only thing missing from this video
like entering the big brother house lol
Coady - what a character
The best player of premier league ❤❤❤
14:28 THE GOAT IS BACK
second cameraman is something else bro, instead of just being quiet like a normal boring cameraman. he is actually jokes
Send Eric dier back home for that hat 😂
LIONS ????  🤣😂😅🤣
England Gonna be winning it, Cricket World Cup won by England 2022
Three lions 0 ⭐️🤣🤣🫶🏽
Trent is so unlikeable man, just comes with pure attitude
Dier looks like he thinks the World Cup is in Israel with that beanie😂
I'm so happy for Maddison, he deserves to be there 🤗
Come on you'll need to go and turn it up there in Qatar
The “You ok?” greeting in England feels condescending asf maybe it’s just cause I’m American
Saka standing up to shake Harry kanes hand is so wholesome 😊
Cameraman left Luke shaw hanging man.
Sanchooooooooo
I usually say this.. Pickford looks like a Picky Blinder
Always looked forward to the WC, not this one though.  Is it because of Qatars human rights record?   No, its the sickening wokery of the England team who are an absolute embarrassment to my nation.  Hope they get pumped off everyone in the group stage.
who is on the camera ?
USA forever, we will beat england mark my words USA USA USA USA
Trippier and Wilson have to make Grealish apologize to Miggy
madison been called up
🎉
Saka telling walker don’t worry about that when he asked when arsenal are gonna stop winning 😂 love it
Whats the girls name
Who is that asking for the passports?
Shame that smith Rowe is not there
where's raheem?
There to lose.
RLC Toney and Reece shoulda been there 😢
Trent looks so miserable. Take the negative energy elsewhere
Why the FA make all the players wear the boring sweater to the camp? Let them show out their cool cloths. Shout out to Maddison and Ben White
Maguire & southgate probably chat about how they’ve been relegated and are egregious players , dream big kids ! 😂😂
absolutely buzzing to see wilson's cheeky grin
Trent looks sad u lot really need to cut him some slack
in 14:31 this the face Which will make England cry because of its exit from the World Cup in the quarter-finals. Remember my words
Trent ain’t a happy man right now. They need to get him some support asap
Eric dier turning up like harry from home alone
Maguire and Eric Dier should of gotten out of an old school VW beetle together with giant shoes on
Here's to all hypocrites that took the knee - Stay out of woke politics
4:23 "When are you guys gonna stop winning" 🤣🤣
I got goosebumps when maguire arrived
Still a shock that Tomori and Toney wasnt picked. High hopes for the World Cup!
trent just doesnt look happy to be there
B
Yall suprised to see saka stand up to greet his teammates, he is of a Yoruba-Nigerian decent well known for their repectable manners to elders...and am also glad to see Rashford!!!!
My favourite kinda videos on Youtube: England squad arrivals.
James madders, what a guy!! 🔥🔥🔥
Jude Bellingham would win for us
It'll be me one day.
We will win the world Cup because we are glorious England
Saka is the kante of England very humble focus player all the best to the England World Cup this time a do believe England got a chance of winning it
Who’s the girl collecting passports?
Nothing can top world cup unique .
LOL they cut Maguire arrival short.
These videos confuse me
Only 2 people shared a car, madness
Saka is a star boy. Humble and well brought up with manners. Protect at all costs.
anyone here who can't wait for the presence of ilcapitano numero seis
Gets me hyped. Come on England. May be missing a name or two but what a squad. Let’s get behind them
Why do players who play for the same team come in different vehicles?
Jude Bellingham is only 19? Going to be some player.
FA and players should play their part to help to be environmentally friendly. Most of the players apart from Jude have travelled from the same geographical area to the camp so I don't understand why they can't travel together like Callum and tripper highlighted. Clearly FA and footballers are living in their own little world. As an example: the London and Liverpool/ Manchester based players should travel together.
If the coach don’t start sterling and every other who is not in form this team can go all the way
Jude with a German bag 😂
Shame on the lot of you for going - exploiting the deaths of poor enslaved workers just so you can have your sports cars  Wont be forgotten
I wish England win the world cup  And somali win the peace and life cup😭😭😭
Declan’s bought a spare bag for the trophy 🏆
What content!  ...although is it just me or does Trent already look like he doesnt want to be there
The vibes arent the same as the Euros
All the best lads
What is the name of the backpack most of them use
Hope Tripps and Wilson give Grealish some friendly miggy banter
Rashford and Messi are the only reason imma watch the World cup
Just knew Grealish would be last! 🤦‍♂️
Nice to see Trips arriving with Wilson and taking care of him like a big brother 🖤🤍
What’s the brand of the backpack the players are strapping?
All 👍 the best to England 🇬🇧 👏  Cape Town
lets make a deep run !
Bunch of overpaid guys another dismal performance and the most boring manager going
harry maguireeeeeeeee
Waiting fo that guy # HARRY no not "K" but MAGUIRE 😅
Trent looks thrilled to be there
the only one star in this team #Jude Bellingham
14:29 THE ONE we have all been waiting for...
saka looks like the zebra from Madagascar
Be lucky to get out the group
I hope Saka does well. He can put the Euros 2020 final behind him now. Go for it👍
Who cares, the whole thing STINKS of corruption with oil money being handed out in brown envelopes to those who should know better.  That’s how Qatar got awarded the games in the first place.
Coming home after the group stages! Cant wait to watch the Garden Gnome Maguire....
why is Dier here lol
This is how I be when I get selected for my secondry school  team and i had a reason to miss my last lesson
Gallagher.... robbing a living
It's coming home!! 🦁🦁🦁
Dier leave that Spurs bag outside and don’t bring it in the facility big man, we’re trying to win trophies not curse the poor boys
mah boy saka
the auto-caption when Jude was coming 🤣
Hope they enjoy playing in stadiums,the construction of which cost 4000 lives.
I miss the Jesse and rashford arrival moments 🥲
Bring it home lads!
Trent looks miserable towards everyone like he don't want to be there unlike everyone else
I wonder how many of them lads took turns on the blonde 😂
why are all the dap ups so clean 🤣🤣
Why does Bukayo Saka always make me smile when I see him?? Such a respectable young man. Never change lad.
Ivan toney should have been there bro
Coady seems like the nicest bloke
I couldn't love Coady anymore. Just such a genuine guy.
Every player wearing a goyard/gucci/lv bag
Harry M ? BAHAHAHAHAH
Maguire looks so nervous, I hope he can perform and not give in to the pressure he’s been having for the past 2 seasons
Diers the man. Proper handshakes and no coco Chanel backpack
When Maguire arrived i ended the video. Let me know if the rest arrived safely
Best of luck boys ❤️
Saka is so humble
It is coming home, it is coming home, football is coming home. Hooray!
Saka was brought up well
So
Trent looked so sad 😢
Bukayo🥰🥰🔥🔥🔥
Fair play saka stands up to respect every player. Kyle walker hardly makes eye contact
Maguire 😂
I see Maguire, all I hear is Gangster’s paradise by Coolio 😂
Absolutely buzzing for Callum Wilson. And James Maddison. Fully deserved call-ups, and only hope they both get some decent minutes. Do Coventry and the country proud. 💙 🦁 🦁 🦁 💙
three cubs
Anyone know the name of the women taking the passports ? Swear i recognise her from somewhere 🤷🏻‍♂️
I'm happy 😊 for Saka, White and Ramsdale playing ▶️ for England 🇬🇧 team being an Arsenal fan. England rocks 🪨 🎸 😎 🙌 👌 👏.
14:40 He is back😎
Im not west ham’s fan but declan rice looks so handsome😂
should have Harvey Barnes
Bukayo is such a joy to watch 😂
Wait why didn't they show more of mcblunder?
Aint no way Maguire got the least airtime 😂😂
funny to compare the arrivals of the English and french players.. much more friendliness in the english camp  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0-JHLU0Kh4
Where is toney
literally every single handshake was soo cleaannn howwwwww😮‍💨
What are the bags there all wearing?
Wishing Saka and sterling all the best
nothing short of player's grooming...hope to come back home early this wc lads
Saka and Kyle seems like rivals
Come on Rashford let’s gooooo 🐐✊🏽⚡️win the world cup england
Love how they got Maguires done quickly lol
14.36 did maguire just go in for a kiss? 😂
It’s called soccer
Come on England we got it this year that’s fur sure
Thon Volvo Madison arrives in isn’t healthy. While racket out of it
Camera is shaking a bit. Making me feel a bit nauseous. Who is the cam man?
🏆Mighty England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏆⚽️🏏⚽️
Comin home
I really like how Kieran Trippier and Callum Wilson were respectful to the driver and thanked him. So did Eric Dier and Bukayo Saka standing up to greet people. No egos there and I really think these guys are a happy cohesive unit.
These lot isn't even excited like the South Americans or even the French bunch
Protect Bukayo Saka at all cost.
I miss Tierney with the Tesco plastic bag😠
Who’s the women that is always there?
Yohoo WORLD CUP!!! I HOPE ITS SUCCES BRING HAPPINESS!!
more like 3 kittens...
Sterling 😅
I hope the togetherness of this team will help them get through, what an amazing group of talented players.
Trent looks buzzin to be selected…
Wonder what there bedrooms are like.
Arnold expression & body language was off.
With the connection on these greetings you can tell that’s all the staff do during the regular season waiting on international duty 😂😂
England is winning lets gooo
Eric dier you and your hat should not be at this World Cup 🤣
Win this year or never
Wow, what togetherness this shows, come on boys!
crazy to think last time around Dele Alli was part of this squad
How come they bring their own boots ?
4:20
Pickford and Henderson ❤ doing the north east proud 🔴⚪️🔴⚪️🔴⚪️
After here they will be playing Bangladesh 😅
grande Dier drinking mate
What’s wrong with Trent
Best 17 mins I had in a long time
Saka forgot his bag🤣
Wonder which England player is tea bagging that blonde? Was feeling optimistic until Dier, Pickford and Maguire rocked up. But then the main men arrived, Trippier and Callum Wilson.
It's coming home init?
Trippier and wilson should have told grealish to play like almiron 😂😂
Alright mate?  Yeah, you?
l love the fact they gave every other player a decent length of video time then when it comes to maguire, its like 3 seconds LOL
nice.. but i'm concened about, why the players didnt use their own car?
That volvo needs a service
Every time I see her welcoming the players I think ‘has she?’ hmmmm 😆😆😂
Why does Ben white look so tall
If it comes to pens dont F about shuffling about trying to be clever, just run and kick the ball I have seen loads go in doing it that way
cool
Really enjoyed watching this. Nice to see the Newcastle boys sharing a cab and shaking their driver's hand...
For a minute i thought that Ward-Prowse was sitting there after he went to the barber 14:19
Gallagher is overrated
Arrived in diesel vehicles, not as woke as can be.
I thought Wilson and Trippier had some news for Grealish
@3:15 Saka true gunner star boy..born and bred Arsenal to the point he had his Arsenal shopping bag but forgot his backpack and passport 😁🙌❤
lol saka has got the arsenal logo on his bag thingy
Declan Rice does not play for my domestic team but wow he has to be one of my favourite football players. He passion oozes outta him! #ComeOnEngland 🦁⚽️🦁⚽️🦁⚽️
Where's Troy Hawke when you need him
I reckon we will get to the semi against Netherlands
We welcome our district player like that! In Assam india
tomori robbed
Mr. Gucci man 💙💪
Not seeing James hurt me 😓
How many people have realized that TAA IS NOT IN HIS MOODS
Trippier got to start Pope and Wilson supersubs To be honest I skipped everyone but the Newcastle players
Who tf called Jordan henderson
Let's go England! Fan from Taiwan
The disrespect from Trent
Who gives a dam about the World Cup  except for the families of the many dead who biult the stadiums . And the seconded class treatment of women in this 12 century country
14:30🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
trent looks devastated
Ben White's lowkey rude looool
🤔Why does Trent always look so miserable, just don’t understand it.
Why all seperate cars?
2:14 the cringe 💀
Its sad to see how down TAA looks when he enters
WC 2022 : England champion 101%
Always look forward to seeing Conor Coady, hands down most polite and upbeat bloke here
Dier not in the official tracksuit confirms he shouldnt even be in this squad lol
Why is trent depressed😢
5 at the back again
The Indoor camera man carried
Saka full of manners getting up to meet everyone. Respect B
I don't know myself what keeps me hooked to these arrivals videos. There is something soo satisfying about these videos. 😌😌
Where the ringmaster
Bukayo Saka is well culture👏 He is literally humble and a down to earth being🙌❤
england it's the new champions of this world cup
Guarantee that blonde chcik gets railed by at least 2 of those players
Hey England do you think it is possible to start james maddison because our school is going to watch the iran match
Wow tomori looks sick, oh wait…. Gareth you fool🤦‍♂️
Trent seems so down man
Maddison what a guy, so chuffed for him
Strong squad hopefully the lads can bring football home. ⚽️⚽️⚽️
17 minutes of watching this video & B. Saka standing up greeting his mates! What a player. Please keep him safe 😂😂🙏
Pickford to Foden was shameful, completely enthusiastic and frankly rude.
Rice's barnet gets better every month
In the best way possible... Im so jealous that these lads get the chance to do this, not just about playing football, look at the atmosphere there everyone is happy, they are about to go on the greatest lads holiday ever, again suuuper jealous 😂😂
No one loves Conor callagher mate
something about seeing the england squad together always got me 😶‍🌫️💯
Saka representing Arsenal in and out of stadium is heart warming to watch💗💗💗........My star Boy💪🏻
pickford has bad eye sight?
englan team mating up for straight 17 mins
14:26 jump scare warning!
This is one of the most fun, energetic and respectable teams in the world. Glad to be in this era.
Qatar looks a bit like England 😂
6:27 ouch
The Clair Fontaine is nice than yours
Wholesome 🤝
Can anyone recall other arrivals where teammates carpool? Seems like Kieran and Callum are the first I’ve seen do that
I’m not confident of us doing well at all, All our defenders are either injured or have just come back from injury and not played any games are all.  I can’t believe Calvin Phillips is in the squad as he’s just come back from injury and has not played a single game.  I do think Ivan Toney Should’ve gone as he is the third highest scorer in the league with 10 goals. Lol And yet Marcus Rushford is going and he has only scored four goals and rank 22 Premier League goal scorers table.  Makes no sense at all lol.
14:34 that's what i was looking for
16.25 Almirons Apprentice arrives
Full Squad:  GK: Jordan Pickford (Everton) GK: Nick Pope (Newcastle United) GK: Aaron Ramsdale (Arsenal) DF: Trent Alexander-Arnold (Liverpool) DF: Conor Coady (Everton) DF: Eric Dier (Tottenham) DF: Harry Maguire (Manchester United) DF: Luke Shaw (Manchester United) DF: John Stones (Manchester City) DF: Kieran Trippier (Newcastle United) DF: Kyle Walker (Manchester City) DF: Ben White (Arsenal) MF: Jude Bellingham (Borussia Dortmund) MF: Conor Gallagher (Chelsea) MF: Jordan Henderson (Liverpool) MF: Mason Mount (Chelsea) MF: Kalvin Phillips (Manchester City) MF: Declan Rice (West Ham United) FW: Phil Foden (Manchester City) FW: Jack Grealish (Manchester City) FW: Harry Kane (Tottenham) FW: James Maddison (Leicester City) FW: Marcus Rashford (Manchester United) FW: Bukayo Saka (Arsenal) FW: Raheem Sterling (Chelsea) FW: Callum Wilson (Newcastle United)
Saka is not a morning person lol
Harry Maguire makes me sick.
14.29 , The moment we've all been waiting for! When that doors opens 🤣
14:26 The arrival that we all have been waiting for, Mr Harry Maguire!!!!
Group-B Table Leader, they will not go far then that
no fap failed, great
Icl the connections with the handshakes are so clean and they arent reacting lol.
Am happy for Wilson
Raheem is feeling too much cold
Man Trent needs to be mor grateful and happy bro 😭
There is no world cup without an arrivals video🤩
Obviously Grealish is the last to arrive.
Tripper to Grealish "Sponsored by Gucci?" 16:16
Why do they ask for passport?
Will be sad to see the exit without qualifying the group. Such great talent destroyed by Southgates tactics.  We beat Iran hopefully but US and Wales we don't win. All goals come from a Peno from HK or tap ins.
Both Conors are back lets goo
14:30 😍
the Arsenal boys using the Arsenal bags 😁 so proud of them 🥺
Lets gooo England
14:29 england's lucky charm 🍀
Come on boys!!! I want to see bodies on the line from start to finish !!!
Where is Sancho 😭
14:30 is where the best england player is at
cmon boys bring it home
Burgers
I thought Maddison is injured?
This video is 🔥🔥🔥🔥
man like raz miss him @ city
Never expected to enjoy seeing people get out of a car, and fist pump everyone...🤷‍♂️🤣...roll on World Cup 2022!! Come on England!
Whenever Shaw reduce his weight, he became Shawberto Carlos
I wish Jordan Henderson is the captain of this current squad. He has won all the club trophies and it's well experienced in big games. With all due respect to Harry Kane though. All the best England!
Dier steady with backpack Nike SB
Luke shaw should be the captain in here ...he really do alot for the national team
Saka is a national gem
Nothing beats the sound of a diesel engine
Are they in Qatar or in England?
Why does Eric Dier look like he's been found on a park bench 🤣
Why didn’t the players from the same club get a minibus or something together ?
these guys all with  the same  leather designer backpacks is a wee bit cringe
4:20 "What's going on, B? You guys gonna stop winning?" Haha!
I have no confidence with some inconsistent players
England need to play an all-white team in order to win trophies.. like the women did.
13:05 THAT’S THE ENGLAND MENTALITY, COME ON
Nothing like carpooling from the regions to save the environment..
Imagine foden training under pep and then under Gareth solskjaer
How Kalvin Phillips made the squad I'll never know.
man come with an arsenal bag
😍🔥
we arent getting far with this squad, how dier, Maguire and especially Kalvin are in that squad i dont know
Seems like Goyard is the new Louis Vuitton ⚽️🏆who brought Maddison in a P reg car 🤣🤣 keeping it real. outfit and bag worth more than the Volvo!
Ayy that clap when saka and white handshake ⚡🤝👌👌
Why does dier look like he just got out of nick for an attempted robbery, 😑🤨
I love how the Newcastle guys came in the same van! Trippier is one of the keys to England victory
Seeing Maguire rock up must have been one of the worst moments I've seen for England guy shouldn't be there he knows it aswell as all of us
Waiting for Jack grealish
Come on England 💯💪
You can see why Conor Coady is loved by the camp , my mans always buzzing!
Love how they just showed slabhead getting out and nothing more
All those handshake claps were so crisp
Been waiting for this one!! Love this team so much!
Com' On ENGLAND!!
Saka, Coady, Rice and Phillips seem like the most likeable guys! SO happy this team is full of respect for eachother.
I almost thought they were in singapore😂
Maddison tryharding
love all the bags of boots
Saka is like a school kid. Man, dude is just so humble.
Coady has this great leadership charisma, so does henderson and rice. Kane might be their best player, but these  persons has better leadership for sure..
That saka and Ben white dab up was emasculate
Saka has the best personnality in that squad, after there is Mount, Hendo and Coady.
Saka:how are you. Camera man:yes bruv.
14:33 should be Tomori or Smalling there instead of that plank
Why Trent always got an attitude
Won't be long before we'll be watching them coming home lol 🙂🌈✈🤣😂
Great to see everyone turning up and showing team spirit… come on England!!!
COME ON ENGLAND!!!!!
Trent looks ecstatic to be there
Maguire the Fridge didn’t get much footage
Raheem scared me! 😂
if messi or ronaldo dont win, i go for england
Beans the only one in black
Eric Dier with the maté… a man of culture 😂. I wonder whether it was Bentancur, Lo Celso, or Lamela that introduced him to it.
Trent looked unhappy. Maybe he felt he didn't deserve to be on the team
proud to be a gunner
Is there a nicer human being on the face of the earth than Connor Coady?
I really enjoy these videos for some reason! Come on lads!!!!!!
you can actucally feel that there is no synergy
Switch off the 2022 world cup!
Walker asking saka “when are you going to stop winning” saka replied “ don’t worry about that bro”😂
Nothing beats the arrival videos! Let’s go 🤩
Respect to all the drivers getting their passengers safely door to door in the atrocious weather today.
To me, these guys don’t look ready they are not going to win this World Cup. They all look stiff
Congratulations England on winning icc T20 world cup best wishes for fifa wc love from 🇮🇳
Ben White, Bukayo Saka, Aaron Ramsdale 👏
Get the taxi running won't be long till there home
The difference between TAA and Bellingham. One is miserable and hardly acknowledges anyone, the other is warm and embraces everyone. Speaks volumes on them as individuals.
Will England games be cancelled if the king dies?
4:22 Kyle Walker to Saka: "you guys need to stop winning" Now you know how Liverpool feeling every year😂
THE TREATMENT ON HARRY MAGUIRE AND RAHEEM STERLING😭😭😭
ENGLAND WILL WIN IT THIS YEAR🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 Remember my words
Bellingham needs to start!!!!
Rice 😂😂hoping bring the trophy 😂
It always amazed me to see the England national team players doing there arrivals with arsenal, Tottenham...  bags,i think they should not do it.
Rice 😂😂hoping bring the trophy 😂
Cristiano Ronaldo owns you.
Wasn't Qatar in desert 🙃
When you see That Benz van. You should know it’s Harry
This is a cool behind the scenes video .  Hoping USA and ENGLAND go far .
The moment we have all been waiting for 14:30 Maguire 🛐
It’s like the worlds most awkward stag do meeting up for first time
No chance
Saka with d biggest suite case mama packt a lot of African food lol
This is the best Part
why they all have the same back pack, this is def an ad.
Conor Coady seems a genuinely nice bloke.
4:30 that clap was immaculate
Maguire over tomori is the biggest mistery never solved
Eric Dier thinks he’s from Argentina 😭😭
This is master class on how to greet someone and shake hands haha
Some clean high 5’s in this vid
trent looks so out of it
Anyone know that girl staff id?
Ya gotta love these arrival vids, top notch every time 👌
I’m dead, they’ve showed us Maguire for 5 seconds 😭😭
C'mon Trent light up a bit, why all the glum?
Maddison was like ain't doing the suit thing 🤣😁
Mason Mount is the nicest guy, even knew the cameraman’s name
Thats saka arsenal backpack is weird
Saka is such a legend
14:30 the joke🙂
Excited about this squad.. only 1 i would change is gallagher for toney imo
Idk why but I absolutely eat this content up
What’s in Eric Dier’s peculiar little bag?
WHATS THAT WOMENS @@@@@
England Sponsored By Goyard.
Why is Trent so anti 🤣
Saka the best, didn't see Ramsdale, go go three Lions
Come on boys ❤ 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Everyone arriving all happy apart from Trent hahah
Cheer up Trent ffs your going to the World Cup!!! Everyone else smiling and happy! 🙄
Best of luck 3-lions❤🇮🇶🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Saka is everything 😍😍😍
Sorry but I can’t wait to see them lose
4:31 that handshake connection was 10/10
Lovely stuff Come On Gents !!! World Cup fever in the air !!!
Maguire coming in be like: scene bro
A true English morning for the arrivals.
Trent Alexander Arnold 🙃
14:27 the goat 🐐
England will win the world cup 🏆, mark my words! Go boys show 'em how it's done.
Everyone: Bags and cleats in hands The GOAT McGuire: Hands in pockets. What's up?
13:09 *Yep, they ain't winning it. Bottled it already.*
Is it coming home this time ?😅
Why’s trent crying
The Jamaican had to be the last to arrive 😂😂😂
Been waiting for this
They're coming home they're coming home.....at about the quarter final stage I'm afraid. 😭
Body language alone, Bellingham and Rice first 2 on list.  A few players are rabbits in the headlights, lacking confidence before even kicking a ball.
I just love it when the WC comes around, players from all teams, rivals, come together to play for their country!!
love the way saka just has an arsenal string bag while others carry luxury
From this video I totally understand why coady is in the squad.
Trent clearly has no friends ☹️
17 minutes of player arrivals, nothing quite like it. 🤩🍿
This is reminding me of the euros. Come on England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
conor coady is such a genuine nice fella
Ahh yess😌17 minutes of handshakes and "you alright?". I'm here for it
Finally 🔥
where  is the lion ? only can see skinny hyenas
Jordan Pickard got his Peli cas....ha. Surely keeping the 32 inch and ps5 safe
love nothing more than an arrivals vid
BELLINGHAM TO MAN CITY
Proud to be a England cricket team fan and England football team fan 🦁🦁🦁
It's coming home football coming home England 2022
Bring it home 🏆my boys 🦁🦁🦁
trent looks moody
More like the Kittens🐱have arrived at World Cup
Everyone of the lads looks excited 😂
I don’t even know why I watched this entire thing 😂😂😂
Again gold generation without manager.
That greeting between Saka and White. There was a knowing in it. 😌
The video we’ve all been waiting for. 🇶🇦
Bukayo showed up modestly with a plastic bag of items what a professional! Saka show the world what England is all about. We love you famo this is coming from a United supporter. Let’s Go Three Lions
Hope they will comming home empty
Imagine if the only thing you had to do tomorrow was ask players for their passports
I can’t explain why I look forward to these videos just leave me be 🤣🤣🤣
wow Saka has to stand everytime? that's so humble mahn i wanna be like him so bad 😔
Why call themselves 3 lions when them loins are not native to UK
Toney should be in these team
Why they are using the same backpack? Some sort of fashion nowdays?
Trent doesn't look in place,, very unhappy
As soon as u hear international duties my souls aches waiting for these arrival videos.. guilty pleasure for sure
@14:28
I live English kipper
at 14:30 you will se the clown of europe
Conor coady is a top lad
trent looks miserable
Mason's smile before he got out of the car 😅😅😅 made me smile too
Come on boys 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Why don’t Trent look happy to be there? If he don’t want to go should of just gave up his spot to the best RB Reece James
Marcus Rashford is built different. What an athlete.
Qatar ❤
This is the most wankiest things I’ve ever seen.
Saka respectfully stood to greet his skipper. They don't make kids like him anymore. Salute.
when will they fly to Qatar?
Saka😍
Eric DIer is more Argentinian than anyone jajajjaja
Just from this you can see what Coady brings, even if he doesn’t play a minute he just seems to be such a positive influence around the camp.
James maddisons face is that of a dream come true
There all so happy to see the blonde bird again 😂😂
Come on England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🦁🦁🦁
Just watching this giving me goosebumps come on lads!! 🦁🦁🦁
Love when Dec's waiting for the door to open up and he's just there staring and smiling 😭 same as Mason 😂
Why do the players always have to give their passports up once they arrive?
14:28 Arrival of the GOAT🐐🐐🐐
Dier looking like summer roadman
and the trend of giving harry maguire less minutes continues  even in behind the scene videos no way man
so glad these are back, brain massages
Benjamin White is such a character i love it.
Com on England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 ❤
That bird loves a hug
Oooh World Cup friends
🦁🦁🦁
Maddison should be a part of the welcoming committee 🤣🤣
It's coming home mark my words 15/11/2022
My man Dier turns up looking like he’s just about to commit a burglary.
Conner coady i ain’t got much won’t be playing anyway 😂
Foden Dier  both  bring club covers
did they just skip maguire's entrance
See you in 2 weeks
I was here for this! I love these videos. The sound off those handshakes is so satisfying too.
Yes need Declan’s energy
You wont even win the world cup.
Check out 14:29       HERI MAGWAYA HEEE HARRY MAGUIRE HEEE HERI MAGWAYA
14:30 Arry Maguuuuire!
henderson ruined this wholesome video, my mood went straight to anger soon as i saw him, we dont need racists on our squad
Happy to see Rashford and Luke Shaw, best of luck 🤞
Feel a bit sad for Trent all coz he's had one poor season
Maddison🔥🔥🔥🔥
Will out round 1
Grealish arriving with a Peaky Blinder lol. Proper Brummy
Saka getting out with the arsenal bag love to see it😍 #itscominghome
Rashford only raised his game so he could get his world cup place other than that average Asda shelf stacker
Mason seems like such a cool person to be around!
I'm confused is EE sponsoring the England team or Louis Vuitton?
World Cup arrival video! There’s something about arrivals and the satisfying handshakes
Where is Sancho
Trent was in no mood to smile at all 💀😂
Pemain titipan pemkot manchester hahaha si kapten dungu maguire
Would love to ask them when they walking in do they see the player or a prem badge 😂
Should’ve taken Sess
Watching to see the arrival of Harry Maguire
343                      Pickford         BenWhite_Stones _Walker  Tripier _ Bellingham_D Rice_ Shaw  Bokayo Saka                PhillFoden                      Harry Kean  #Bravooo England #Finalll
Rice looks like Jos Buttler
Some crisp handshakes in this
What’s in the envelopes!?
Bring it home❤️❤️
Honestly, can’t see England going far
It’s coming home boys
Thank you harry maguire for coming so England can go home faster.
@14:28 The legend entry😁
I seriously can't wait for this world cup
Dec got a suitcase for the trophy👀🥶
Trent with the Zaha vibes!
I’m not even from England but I am a massive Premier League fan and I just love to see the togetherness, love and respect between the players that travel with the England squad
Do us proud lads!❤️
Connor Coady.......What a fella.!!!
Foden awkwardly clapping himself in at 11:57 😂
Harry Maguire
Madders arriving in a volvo
Connor Coady is a top bloke
I always wonder why players from the same club don’t travel in the same car   ? Wilson and Trippier did this time   James Maddison first in 👏 eager
Bem diferente da seleção de Portugal!... Hahaha. Outra Vibe!...😂
Nobody. Absolutely nobody. The photographer: Welcome to the World Cup
the love everyone has for saka man hes a superstar
Let’s go Liverpool boys
I burst out laughing when Pickford came out, he looked so angry already
Go one better and win it for us boys!!! COYL
I like how they gave 3 secs to Maguire to avoid annoying fans !
Nah fr no messing about no vibes just straight wins if we don’t win the World Cup with this squad Southgate gotta go Apparently picking Maguire over Tomori and Phillips was the right decision so let’s see
I was waiting for Mount 🤩
Maddison is so happy 😂😂
Why maguire skipped?😢
Nice to see bukaa arriving with an arsenal paper bag... down to earth boy ... humble
Maddison keep smiling😂😂😂😂
https://youtube.com/shorts/ED-C-SNivNo?feature=share
come on boys! no bottling!!
Saka the only one that stood up to greet everyone ❤❤❤❤
The arrivals videos get me so hyped for the World Cup!! COME ON ENGLAND!!!
Where do you guys think we will reach in the tournament I say last 16
Love these videos! Declan Rice seems like the nicest guy there!
Ayyyyeee @England 👏
Why does this remind me of the hobbit scene where all the dwarfs meet up at the house 😆
Declan with his spare suitcase for the trophy 🤣
Grealish awkwardly arriving at the same time as Almiron's teammates is things you love to see.
Theres about 150,000 pounds worth of back packs arriving.
Love Declan rice and saka
Goalkeeper = Nick Pope....onfire....right back = trippier....super sub forward = Callum Wilson Left forward = Foden, etc  Go Go England
Looking forward to see Saka shining in this WC
I was constantly checking for this video 😂
Why are they carrying their own bags....in Qatar there are plenty of REAL LIFE SLAVES to carry them for you.....phew. Then you can see where their ancestors live when you play on top of their graves. NO England player can EVER shout about equality or Racism again after playing in that awful country.
Declan rice is just a proper nice guy
Lets see if the team can focus on football rather than the rainbow agenda 🌈 .
obvs apart from the people ive heard speak before, no one sounds like i was expecting them to
How's the weather rashy?
Been waiting for this what a saddo
legends always late ..... harry maguire
The Brit’s spam “are you alright/ok?”
The one player I didn’t envy was Harry 😢
Saka is simply everyone’s favorite 🥰 esp shaw he likes him a lot 😂 United fan but I love Saka
14:28 We were all waiting for the Goat..
Go rot pingerland we will be waiting for you I’m March for the Euros qualifying. You will be knocked out by the first team that keeps the ball you woke muppets.  CHAMPIONS OF EUROPE YOU WILL NEVER SAY THAT 😂😂
If my volvo sounded like a truck i wouldve probably bought a truck fr
I always like the girl who gave them a hug and collect their passport. What is her name?
How tf did coady get himself into that squad
Some of these guys are lacking backpack game wise
7:19 🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶 whats happenin here???
I take it a quick transit to Qatar for this team of players for England and we look forward to the resumption of EPL on 26th December 2022.
Coady just happy to be in the squad might not get sniff
so it is ben or Benjamin on his passport?
Madders thinking it’s France arrival with the drip while his mates in England trackies 😂😂😂
Hypocritical knee bending morons! Political activists only when it doesn’t affect their bank balance, career or their social media likes! I’m English… they don’t represent me, my country, it’s history or our morals!
15:43 I'm here for this. CW9
i’m jus here for saka
Trent seems a friendly lad...
How is Gallagher there man it’s so dumb. Jwp has been robbed
This squad is about to do a madness. COME ON ENGLAND
The hand shakes get me every video 😏💦
Made my day! Come on boys!!!! 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
The one thing I do like about this squad is confidence I don’t see a single player there that would be nervous going into a match or nervous to step up for a penalty even saka probably the youngest player in the squad after missing the penalty in the final has put that behind him now and become one of the best players in the prem
the video we all look forward to
Throwaway Gallagher’s passport
9:31 General John Stones.
Saka is full of respect he stands up to greet almost all players
Trent looks fed up already 😂😂
The Atmosphere and the Respect that each player shows to their fellow team mates is great. They all have a real bond
So glad to see the excitement of the guys who made it. Must be a huge giddy feeling representing your country in the WC, a childhood dream. Gutted for the guys who missed out due to injury or non-selection but I’m sure they’re all cheering for the lads.
Must be really fun to be mates with Mason Mount
14:29 yeah... yeah, the GOAT had arrived... LOL
Maddison
Trent is really not having it
Is a disgrace having this World Cup is Qatar, is sad that people will watch and ignore the human rights violations and homophobia. Shame on Fifa, many of us will not be watching based on these grounds
Its saka with the arsenal bag for me🤣
Swap Maguire for tony and i might give England a chance
Challenge time... Count the hands shakes. And if your feeling adventurous count the "are you good's".
Kalvin Phillips just looks happy to be alive all the time.
Declan pleeeeeeeeeeease we need you at chelsea
lol i love these videos, should have had that greeter guy stand next to the drop off to hype them up
They’re all so adorable ❤️😭
Can’t wait to see Messi score a “Ankara Messi” goal against England in the WC Final ❤❤
The back room staff should be featured in an interview as well
Trent looks happy
14:26 There he comes. The goat of England!
Saka is so mannered person
Even with some odd callups, that is a seriously strong squad and has a real chance to push far this world cup.
Trent is a bell end haha - Your at a world cup when youve been playing like a championship player bro, chin up haha
Harry maguire kok di skipppp
Trent does not wanna be there
🔥
Seeing Dier, Coady and Maguire pull up gave me a reality check of our WC chances 😂
How .. they're coming one after another...
Longest appearance I’ve seen from Phillips all season
Ben white is taller than he looks on the pitch😅😅
Maddison swag on point
Not taking Bowen is criminal
14:29 🐐
At what point do we play find the human rights violates ?
7000 DEATHS, BILIONAIRS WILL ENJOY FOOTBALL ON GRAVES! WELL PLAYED
Maddison looks so happy
Need Steven Gerrard too.
Better win the world cup. Putting 200dollars on Team england
December 18th we are gonna see football come home
Who's the girl collecting the passports?
garrett better start ben white
Tripps and  wils arriving  together⚽️⚽️🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿👌🏾
The Newcastle lads arriving with Grealish is gold. #Almiron
14:28 the goat has returned
Trent not having it lol, he looks like he needs a break 😂 these arrival videos are better than the actual football
Just watched 17 mins of people getting out of cars and I'm absolutely buzzin
#JUSTICEFORLAUREN ✊
Indian here ... I have decided to support England at football wc cause of our shared cricket history .... Any advices that i should follow while supporting the 3lions.
What's her @
Trent ain't feeling it at all
Maguire's lasted 20 secs why?
Ben White vibes are just off, cheer up lad or f off home
Am i the only one happy for Rashford
Nike:Please wear the new official merch when arriving for World Cup Duty. Madders: I had no idea I would get called up
Only the slabhead comes in with the wrong tracksuit
There are not arriving in Qatar, because present time it's 30° Celsius around here , anyway I've spend 1k dollar to watch important matches
Mason Mounth very humble
arrival vids 😍😍😍
Come on 🇬🇧🔥
Can’t not love how much respect they have for eachother and how much they get along club football out the window for a month ❤️ not like old England teams 👀
Saka ❤
What is maguire doing here 😆😆😆
Saka always humble every time
Where is this?
No one's talking about how Maguire's arrival is hardly shown for 10 seconds.
Trent is there physically only ,doesn’t look there mentally 💔.think he’s aware he wasn’t gonna come if James was fit
This is kindness and hearty welcome to all the players back in squad ❤❤❤
Quite disappointed Troy Hawke wasn't there to greet them. 🤣
Trust me when i say this sterling is going to be the best player for england this world cup like he did at the euros carried England to the finals
They are going to be home pretty soon 🥴
theyve been spudding for a while for obvious reasons, but that hand clap sound just hits diffrent 😌
Trent and his weird vibes be happy bro you make every country's RB spot
That's a solid team
Henderson and saka 💀
Atleast it hasn’t taken 3 days for you lot to release this like usual
14:26 arrival of THE GOAT
Won’t watch England or football in qutar and there getting there on a trans plane and kneeing still  it’s a massive no no for many England fans won’t be watching England
I love this video and squad so much, come on england 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 🦁
Where’s Kanes translator?
Training in the fog to go and play in the desert.
Just imagine the level of excitement in that room. Rocking up there about to jump on a plane to the World Cup jeez
Outta all the backpacks I’m not sure if Grealish or Rashford has the most cold💎🔥
No tomori no Toney disappointed
Saka is so nice
Bring it home lads ❤️🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
4:31 that arsenal dap hit different
Long time ago since Young Ali Lingard in Russia
little chilly himself saka saka more love
My guy Saka never forgets arsenal moves it
aaaah another 20 minutes of "you alright" .. love it.
why the camera man always messing up the spud
Somebody check on Arnold man's been looking more sad than past years
Great stuff.  👍👍
It must of been so awkward when grealish hugged trippier
There a Goyard sale going on I didn't know about? :)
first time seeing raz
Ahhhh if only Wilson and trippier had told grealish that miggy says hi 😂
Here they come the flops of the WC Its a bad thing to be English
This has made it feel real now.
Where is Southgate ? (I m french idk the protocol)
I love how Jude was carrying a Dortmund paper bag😍 so excited for him
World cup winner England 🤟🤟🤟
England national team should be using Land Rover no?
Have fun in playing at stadiums built on thousands of slaves graves
Seeing Madders there is class!
TOMORI, TONEY AND WARD PROWSE ABSOLUTELY ROBBED

Raheem zooted 😂
Tripps and Wilson arriving together 👍🏻
Declan rice will be playing some rebel songs to get him going.☘️☘️☘️
Lets go madders and England. I'm excited now
Trent looks like he doesn’t wanna be there
I swear someone has been reading my comments. I said something about how I judged players who didnt carry their bags during the last few arrival videos and now they are all doing it hahahha😂😂😂
Shaw looked so happy to see Saka😂Also that White and Saka 🤝🏾 hit different.Had chemistry 😂
Parking space has changed but I'm ready to go. 19 year old elite mentality
This is what I look forward to
13:08 "that's the spare for when we bring back the trophy " he did not sound confident at all😭😂.
i still cant belive that james maddison is in the world cup
The whole video had me smiling. 😁
Another World Cup Another bottling
Please don’t have Pickford in goal as number 1, looks at Everton’s stats compared to arsenal and Newcastle
Come on harrrrryyyyy, that dudes got a presence ,he can get us over the line 🏆
England belong to me 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Trent looks like an A hole lol
Is Eric Dier drinking Mate 🧉 ?? Bentacur put him on 😂
England🦁🦁🦁😊😊😊
Ivan Toney should've been getting out of one of those vehicles.
Trent walking in like its a waste of his time. Man i wish Reece was fit!
Harry Maguire the beast...🤭🤭
It that the england team going home early from world cup or arriving early for world cup.
Jack just had to be last
when i saw maguire i close the video
Iran 🇮🇷❤
Dier looks like he's boarding a fishing vessel
Fantastic young lads coming through. Big support for the boys from NZ.
England will only win a tournament once Declan Rice is captain mark my words
Why did they skipped Harry footage?? 😂😂😂
Been watching these arrival videos for almost 10-years now, nice to see many others enjoying them as it's padded through the years
14:30 best player of the team 🗿
Still waiting for Tomori and Toney to arrive...
Hypocrisy on a grand scale.💰💰💰
BOYCOTTING WORLD CUP AND ALL SPONSORS
NOT coming home
Where is Ivan Toney, Harvey Barnes and James Ward-Prose, Tammy Abraham, Fikayo Tomori and Jarrod Bowen?
England winner world Cup 2022.❤️🙌🙌🙌
C'Mon England ❤️
Still no Idea what Harry said, That's why I luv him
Phillips always smiling 😊😊😊❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Chemistry 33/33
So glad to see Maddison back honestly. Well deserved
Kane and Dier lets goooo
NEWCASTLE IS WELL REPRESENTED!! wish nothing but the best for our 3 call up!! And wish nothing but the best for England. ⚪️⚫️
Saka is so humble.
I every single time waiting for like this video only England and france do it
These player arrival videos remind me of school trips where everyone had to meet outside the school gates on a Saturday or whatever, and everyone who was already there was always looking out for their mates' parents' cars.
Where's Harvey Barnes?
they gathered…  Kingsman: The Secret Service .
Quarter final at best
How come you against world cup in Qatar and still Goin?
I do love this day. Lets go lads! Trippier will be on the back of my shirt!
PF4720❤
Great group of players we should at least get to the final and go just that one more step come on boys you can do this!!
Nike pope should start!!

Maguire will destroy this campaign
Not even English and I’m smiling like Goofy

trent is giving me big dele ali vibes atm. hope its nothing
how many more elite players does England need!?
I love Madders
How me and the boys feel like when we pull up to sunday league 😂
Everyone's allowed one suitcase, one bag on the back, and a plastic carrybag for the shoes, plus passport in the pocket
CAN’T BEAT ARRIVAL VIDEOS 😍
Saka arsenal boys
Trent does not look happy to be there 😂😂
I BELIEVE
Come on boys. It’s coming home🔥🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Great team but going to get clapped by the US
I'm convinced, it's actually coming home
Harry Maguire scoring the winning goal for England in the final would be poetic
One of the worst England teams ever🤮
connor has to be the most lovely bloke
Saka is the worst pen taker ever
Did Harry McGuire go in through the back door? Never saw him enter like the others.
who’s that girl?
Trent ❤️
Harry Maguire una 😂😂 England really don’t want to go far in this tournament
Why no Tomori and having Harry Maguire instead?🤣
why Maguire is short film just few second 😭
It’s like watching the avengers assemble
Is Arnold depressed ?
Seeing Maguire come out of the car and not Tomori breaks my heart 😢
the moment that you've been waiting for 14:30
17:10 Wilson saying '' thank you '' silently 🤣
The Liverpool players got no love

Eric Dier turned up with a Tottenham bag, the man has no shame 😂😂
Something about arrival videos♥️
France>England
Miss Lingard and Rashford arriving together or Rashford forgetting his passport.
I have a paper due tomorrow, but I'm watching handshakes for 17 minutes....
The whole video is just hearing slaps
whens the goat get there
Mason mount is defo fruity🏳️‍🌈, must be hard leaving his bf Reece James at home 💔
Bellingham 🌟 Boy could be the star for us
Starting 11 in blue England attire
🔥🔥
Watching the Wilson and Trippier rock up together! 🔥⚫️⚪️ lets go lads!!
the nike techs are fire
Kneebending hypocrites and money chasers. Karma will prevail.
Why do they always bring plastic bags with their club logos? What's in it?
Jack grealish was the last one to arrive spend time on he's hair for the world cup  I hope he doesn't do that on game time.
Days of gone when you knew all England team's names. Didn't know Beckham was still playing. 🤣
' World Cup ' ? I'm sure once the games get going I might get interested ... ! 😮
I'm waiting for Mason Mount! All the Best 3 Lions in Qatar
W
Certain guys lift the atmosphere just by being there and some are regular grumps.
“Aye m8 how you? Yadoin gud?”
I live in Qatar been here for over 20 years from the uk , I’m so exited I’m going to all the England games can’t wait cmon boys
glad to see Maddison in the squad
Dier with the Yerba mate 🧉 ❤😂

Why is Trent like that lol
Rashhhh
Mount brought a heavy suitcase bc it's world cup
🦁🦁🦁🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿  come on boys
bukayo with his arsenal bag😍
Actually immense, can't wait boys.
Can’t wait for the day I get my call up
Only positivity from here on out, lets bring it home boys!
Everytime i see TAA, i can't stop thinking about Darren Farley 🤣
Aw saka and Shaw reunite fav father son duo
Why so many ads, who's pocketing the. mon ey?
Put Kyle Walker behind Trent for cover and the world will witness the best right back IN THE WORLD. The young players about to ball out this tournament
Trent looks so tired 🤣
I THINK THREE LIONS🦁 WIN THE WORLD CUP🏆⚽
TAA looks very shy
All hail at 14:29
14:27 is the moment we have all been waiting for.   On a side note... Doesn't Conor Gallagher just look like Jimmy Bullards Re-gen?
Let’s go Saka 🔴⚪️
Trent looks happy to be there
Might aswell send them all home🤣 Southgate ain’t got a clue.
Trent looks unhappy
swear maddison is injured
Best vibes coming from the final Newcastle car
The best video
Can’t believe they didn’t tomori and tammy
All smiles now and crying faces in few weeks
Trent know he's only there if not for Reece James injury, dude doesn't smile
Coady so humble
Imagine the carbon emissions from these cars man
CAN we PLEASE see MORE of RASHFROD
Saka and Ben White ❤❤🤩🤩
Me being Dutch but still waiting for the arrivals videos to drop🙃🙃🙃
these shouldn't be this satisfying to watch but i look forward to them every time
England & France arrival videos always satisfying to watch
Sensing a bad attitude from Trent already.
Love how Rice and Mount had exactly the same reaction when their car doors opened, their smiles were the first thing you can see 🤣🤣
All know that for English players EPL > World Cup
Didn't even show trent getting out of the car, disrespectful
COME ON BOYS!! ALTHOUGH I DOUBT IT'S COMING HOME..
Who drinks mate?
England are going to the finals.. Not sure about winning
Is England sponsored by Louis Vuitton 🤔
Saka always stands up before greets his teammates. How gentle!
Too many bottlers in this team.
Lol I am waiting for this video all day with no reason but really love it
16:59 THIS HANDSHAKE BETWEEN STERLING AND GREALISH THOOOO
Comon England
04:12 Saka gassed seeing his Arsenal boy🤣🤣
I think Jude Bellingham has performance of the tournament for England
Unfortunately their coach is Southgate😅
Wondering the face expressions when they saw Maguire once again 😢
Would love to have a beer with Connor Coady, seems like a really nice bloke
The d-riding of Saka in this comments is insane
solidarity is growing strongly than ever before in the squad, which get easily noticed on every player's faces and postures
been waiting for this for absolutely no reason
I feel bad for trent man. He is generally always happy and smiling.
What’s her @ she is beautiful
we begin to smell the World cup atmosphere around St' George Park as previous Euro 2020, the unforgetable period..
Saka has got to be one of the most respectable players on the planet so so so humble and kind
ATTENTION ALL ENGLISH! Let’s put our rivalries and opinions aside just for a month and back the boys. let’s get behind them :) 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿⭐️⭐️👀
Have they no shame England should boycott this world cup and not go
Maddison🫶
Could here them talking about Ronaldo when Jude walked in 😂
It’s coming home
Can’t wait for them to get back won’t be long😂
Is Dier saying to saka that if we’re being serious or not? I think it’s for the title
Sterling ?
Why does Maddison look like a drugy 😂? Is a joke lol
They love Saka as we all do ❤😂
Trent does not rate Southgate loool man doesn’t wanna be there
Why don’t they give the women that’s there a a big loud handshake
Mancunian Pele🥶
