Well was it fun to almost die?
For anyone wondering, the song playing at the montage part is Nothing Has Changed by The Polar Boys. Also that montage was literally so sweet.
PEAK irl
What’s the song at the end called?
6:32 IS THAT A REFERENCE TO THE VIDEO GAME PEAK MADE BY AGGROCRAB IN COLLABARATION WITH LANDFALL GAMES???????????????????????????????????????????????????
8:43 haminations?

My great aunt lives in new Zealand and both my mom and grandma used to live in new Zealand before they moved.
I live in nz, and yes there’s too many sheep. My bus stop is by a whole 3 sheep paddocks in Snells Beach, near Algies bay
its really cool how you came to NEW ZEALAAAAAAAAND!!! my home country i hope you and your friends had a great time here in New Zealand, and did you guys pick up some Moari when you guys were here and if you didn't, here is one little moari word, Whanau it means family so use it wisely young Maaz >;3
0:13  Umm
11:07 He said he would make an animation with it and he did a year later.
Trust me there are more sheep here in Ireland that the entire population
Peak 6:33
10:56  hmm I see something on the right
the last part with the montage is so sweet
3:20 "Well who ever made that can SHOVE IT"  Love that
Huuh😅5:34
I'm rewatching the video and now remember where the song came from and let's do my favorite song so thank you for introducing it to me
i like that sheep he hit your nuts real good
You are not forgotten yet bananas and coconuts.
10:54  maaz. What are you doing with the marshmallow man?
I’m always the “mom friend” but none of my friends noticed yet bc they haven’t needed anything lol
New Zealand is a copy of Wales i swear
The first time I went hiking I fell off the mountain and landed in a bush that was growing out of the side of the it. My cousins freaked out and looked over the edge just to see me chilling. They pulled me up and I escaped with just a little scar under my lip
"WHAT ARE YOU A DOCTOOOR?"'I CANT STOP LAUTGHING :D
The montage at the end is so wholesome.
The clips of Ur friends at the end  and the song is fire
Please do a video with them! They seem so awesome
hehe …. You saw nothing 😊 Btw where’s Archie?
I did that hike too and I wasnt prepared. I was 12 and I had to wait 30,ins for the bus to come because I finnished early.💀
My favorite part of the video is  5: 30
I went on a 6 hr hike at 6th grade camp, and the hike leader told us to cross a rocky, slippery, river at our first hike, which was unbelievable. Sure enough one of my friends slipped and fell in the water. Thankfully the water wasn’t that deep but the hike leader needed to come down to pull her out of the muddy water. But she got a lot of scratches. :c
8:38 bro became sonic
Road trip from the top of NZ to the bottom, sounds like jet lag
ending montage always has me in shambles 😭😭😭
Sip😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 1:29 1:29 1:29 1:29 1:29 1:29 1:29 1:29 1:29 1:29 1:29 1:29

RIP
i watched some random video mentioning my favourite word game mafia and now suddenly i have a new favourite youtuber
That montage was so perfect 😭
This reminded me of when I was climbing a mountain with my class, the branches of this mountain were like made for hurting travelers legs, each step felt like I was walking through razer blades, I felt like yuji in that one manga panel
d-dad? BaAaAaH we went the wrong way guys turn back
PLS TELL ME WHATS THE NAME OF THE SONG!!

What was the song name at the end called?
Hello, don’t know if anyone will see this but, this video got me to my first concert! It wasn’t even the polars boys!! It was just that I listened to this song which led me to finding a band called good kid (highly suggest listening to them as too). First time I have ever asked friends out or even go to a concert before. So …. Thanks for that ❤
i accidentally skipped and saw Maaz hurtling towards the camera
5:31 The fartn troll face 😂😂😂
Erm WHAT IS THAT PICTURE ON THE RIGHT AT 10:55

the real journey was the friends we made along the way ❤
11:07 no way I’m about to cry to an theamaazing video 😭😭😭 you guys are so cool and awesome

Dracks a hero you owe your life to him
Are you sure the fog was not World War I?
0:33
The hike wasn’t the mountain, it was he friends we made along the way
Why does Maaz draw everyone else with a skin color but he looks like a marshmallow with glasses
Why is this actually wholesome
So you did'nt ACHUALLY break your knees. 🤔
I live in nz
Beautiful ending
NOOOOOOOO, THOMAS IS TAKING OVER THE WORLD AS OUR FAV YOUTUBERS
Maaz just to make sure that your drinking water after watching the vid kinda questioning that you do
"i missed it when we talked alot" Whats that song?
Ur

I've watched this video FIVE TIMES but that end bit ALWAYS makes me tear up ❤
1:41 maaz barely an inconvenience  So I’m guessing maaz had to go through a difficult process, so he can say that  Nope, it was super easy, barely an inconvenience
4:05  *ARTHRITIS*
HAH I live in NZ and have gone on many hikes! (my legs are fine btw) Also, did you like the egg smell in Rotorua?
I LOVE to hike in the woods 👇 if you like to hike too
Great to know you are part-non-neutonian-fluid. Someone who turns into a pancake before returning to your usual form.
8:45 THIS PART MADE ME SNICKER-
I thought I was the only one live laugh love jellyfish ☹️❤️ 2:41
the one piece is the friends we made along the way
i guess the real peak was the friends we made along the way.
I guess we now know you are part slime.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bananas and coconuts are kinda sus.      🍌 🥥🥥
Well I guess it’s not really about the knees we loose but more of the sheep we lost along the way
I wonder what your patients think of you😂
song name pls
how do you make such AMaazing videos?! hehe my sense of humor is bad :[
The end is so wholesome, amazing Maaz. Your right, the real journey is the quality time with friends.
Ahhhhhhh whaaattt the fu*******k!!!!
Hope you had a good time in margret many
As a new Zealander this is an honner to acknowledge our sheep
thank god for drag
I love Maaz breaking physics every time he gets kicked off the mountain, and the friends looking so shocked through it all.
Alex Hirsch once said (gravity falls treasure hunt) the true treasure is the friends we made along the way
8:36 best part of the entire vid
Bro just played Celeste irl 💀  But low key I ❤️ hiking
No bone about it, you're the bee's KNEE with these content. I hope after that it's all peace and harmon-KNEE. KNEE-less to say, hope your knees are good after that.
mates didn't even lose any steam, if anything their safety valves would've been going the whole way down.
Awesome mystical feeling! Keep up the good work!
You should’ve used the drying pan joke
Psh New Zealand more like New Sheepland
Maaz using nothing has changed here introduced me to the polar boys and built my music taste after that. Love this vid. One of the all time greats
NEW ZEALAND!!!!!!
The montage was actually emotional.
8:44
he was racist at 0:32
harder than celeste
And here I am getting exhausted going up the stairs
how you seen any indian animation videos
The real view was friendship all along
I want to go to New Zealand 🇳🇿 😩 😫 😭 😕
Fun fact: the windows 10 Lock Screen was taken in New Zealand
Maybe the truce Knees We're the friends We may along the way
I WANT A FRIENDSHIP LIKE THISS
8:45 why was this so funny
What Did It Feel Like To Fall Off Of A Cliff Maaz?
Why did maaz just.. Dissapear
I can imagine maaz friends in college in the future watching this video because it bring back good memories I guess in the future they will meet again
Me when I do marching band during the summer
Aayyyy, look at you, making the most and best of your life, living on the edge (and almost falling off of it), and having fun. Good for you my mans.
drac is sutch a hero
Did he hike the kilomamjaro mountain
As long as an old video brings you a smile its still good to eat
0:16 You know what they say, Curiosity killed the Maaz.😏
I’m scared of the buff James and jazz with hearts around him in adore in the corner at 10:55
He should visit Whangamata, it's a beautiful part of NZ with beaches of plenty
If the amaazing knew there is 30 something million sheep in New Zealand and 5 million people.
The end was heartwarming❤
l love he went to my home contree
Thomas the tank engine reference
hi
The government is just undercover sheep- *gets kidnapped by sheep*
1:54 I have asthma so ye I am dead
i’ve never cried to an animation before (mainly to the end)
The genuine urge to hug a tree after 2+ hours of hiking on a mountain is real 😂😂 Love from Pakistan 💚
Hola   ... read more
Jesus loves u
*SNIFF
10:16 So all of it was for Drac's cheeks?      Sorry I regret it.

Cool
Got stuck on a 12 hour hike cause my friend read the map upside down for 3 hours. I get the pain
If I will ever go to this place, I will sure going to climb this mountain just because life is not easy and you really need to explore the world😊
Go to the teriyaki  and get a guide!!!

0:45 We can all agree that us; New Zealanders are happy to be us; New Zealanders… Also while we’re in the record I live somewhere around the south in that country. Lemme give u one hint 11:53
You: wobbling down the path like in Harry Potter  Me: actually you’re wrong about that
hahahahahahaha😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Celeste: The AMaazing Trek  Edit: Rewatching this (especially the ending montage) made me genuinely tear up, oh my god, I love this video.
The montage at the end was adorable <333
Wh...why is the end making me genuinely tear up-?😭😭
Let's take a moment to appreciate the background art, it takes underrated to another level Maaz, if you see this, say hi to your background artist for me 10:55 SPEAKING OF BACKGROUND ART- WHAT IS THAT PICTURE OVER THERE 😃
As a new Zealander I know that was nothing Ps the sheep are evil
THE END!😭😭😭👏👏👏BRO YOUR THE BEST MAN EVERL😭
mount  everest hike be like:
I ship Maaz and Drac. Not as much as I ship Maaz with TheOdd1sOut.
CAN SOMEONE SEND ME THE MAYONNAISE VIDEO LINK?? I CANT FIND IT ANYWHERE
I climbed 4 mountaints and am like i dunno 12
I have had 4 surgeries on my feet in the past 8 yrs. That on top of me being the least athletic member of my family already, makes the thought of an eight hour hike up a mountain an absolute nightmare. I couldn't handle a two hour hike after the first two surgeries and i had a hard time breathing when we got to the summit. The first two surgeries were done because i was born with flat feet and as i got older the bones fell out of allignment slowly building up pain that radiated into my lower back. By the time i was 21 i couldnt handle 10 minutes on my feet without my legs locking at the knees and hips and me actually bawling from the pain. For every 10 minutes of pain i had to be off my feet for 3 days to recuperate. My parents told me to just keep taking tylenol/ibuprofen i forget which but it doesn't matter because the pain became too much for either one to suppress. And when i told my parents they finally agreed to get me some x-rays thinking it couldn't be that bad. The doctor took my x-rays and told my parents the bones in a normal foot are to be alligned like the letter I from the |-bigtoe | To the |-Heel  My x-rays showed that the bones in my feet were alligned like the letter Z from the \-Bigtoe / To the \-Heel And the doctor said that they need to operate soon otherwise with how much pain i've been in for so long i wouldn't be able to walk anymore and my parents were floored. So yeah 2015 was fun...me being on crutches from March-november thats almost the whole fudging year. And dont get me started with what happened under the knife. Me and anasthetics...terrible combination. If im not pissing myself when im coming out of it im throwing up in the middle of the operation! And they already fudging gave me all the anesthesia they were allowed to so they have to shove a tube down my throat.... While they broke the bones in my feet replaced them with cadaver bones or pieces and held them together with pins in my heels...again IT WAS A FUN FUCKING 2015 FOR ME....sorry for cursing The latter surgeries werent as hard on me. Surgery number 3 was just needing to shave down a bonespur on one of the cadaver bones since it was cutting into the ligaments at the top of my foot. And then after everything properly fused Surgery Number 4 was to remove the pins in my right foot because no need for them anymore and also everytime i took a step the pins were impacting the newly reformed nerves in my heel.  Again if i was forced to go on an 8 hour hike i would be actually going ahead with murder plans because there would be no way my new feet would even survive. That or i would tell my doctor what she thought and she knows im going to need more surgeries on my feet so she has a wheel chair on standby for me. Anyone dumb enough to invite me on strenuous activities like that get the honor of pushing me in a wheelchair.
u look like an indian
Oh my goodness! It's Maz the tank engine and friends!
Here in New Zealand there are more sheep then people I think
Man I’m dead
i live in nz (north)
We had something VERY SIMILAR going with our class. So in my school from the 7th grade and up, every year every class goes to Elba in Italy for a week to go sailing around the island. So the second time my class went, we did a hike similar to this. We took a bus a quarter of the mountain because there weren't any hiking ways. So we (a lot of grumpy tired 13 year olds) started walking. After ten minutes the sun was so hot that we had to fill our bottles up already and we had to climb the "stairs" that were literally just rocks that were half the size of my legs! But that's not the worst part. We had to get home to the school boats in time. Guess what: WE MISSED OUR FREAKING BUS AND HAD TO WALK ALL THE WAY HOME!   Except for me and some others who hurt themselves  Oh yeah I had sprained my ankle the day before so that made it even worse to hike the mountain 😶
Why was one of his friends blurred out
10:55 yo what
Hi
I actually did this track about eight years ago as well, and I managed to get through relatively unscathed, apart from some scratches I sustained when slipping on some loose soil. It was definitely one of the most beautiful walks of my life, but you really need to be prepared for it. I am a pretty experienced stroller, so that explains why my knees didn’t give way back then😛. Nevertheless it was fun to see you have so much fun with your friends. I wish I had a group of friends like that.
8:42 9:25
Should've just jumped into the water at the bottom of the mountain
That montage at the end was fire 🔥
As a kiwi, I just take our beautiful views for granted so when other people come over and they are like WoAH, I'm just thinking but this is just my backyard 😆
1:05 this is not real and im not a sheep
11:34 if u wanna know thats the peak on tangariro mountain the trail is on the mountain and thats the peak.

I love your video
I Live in Fiji and i like New Zealand because it’s probably as beautiful as Fiji and it has robux and candy lol but that’s just my opinion
Maz: what are you a doctor  *Meanwhile maz becomes a doctor*

Friends are people who care about you are proud about you will comfort you will talk to you will share secrets will do anything to make you happy I want people like that in my life. Someday, I really hope I can be like you one day.

What’s the name of the song at the end
Me a German doing this hike every week with my family
Use your hand.
Jafina being compared to link is pretty cool
the fact that I,m for the most part a kiwi and relate to all the hiking problems, despite growing up doing them is still so funny to me XDDDDDD
😢
Ok but am I the only one that noticed this:  On the thumbnail of the video, it shows maaz's knee cut in twain. But the bone is still in the lower part of the leg, as well as the upper part.
One word: CELESTE.
My knees felt this bc of a full day from 8morning -7night walk mostly not stopping 😭😭only 12km btw
1:41 same with me when i climb mountains...
the last part was so sad but so happy at the same time
I'm so glad you had this great experience with your friends!!!! So proud of y'all! 💚✨🌹
What was the ending song?
07
Correction: The Tongariro Alpine Crossing is at Northern New Zealand, not Southern New Zealand.
YESSS MAAZ, YOU MADE THE NOTHING HAS CHANGED VIDEO!!

Si: *Just frikin' books it down the mountain like Thomas the train* Maaz: Almost like, almost like, *turns around* wait Si SI NO DONT DO IT-! Si: *Runs over Maaz*  -P e n n y❤
Maaz: *Life flashes before his eyes while tripping of a cliff* Drac: *Saves Maaz from dying* Maaz: Ok, *realizes* Drac why are you grabbing my cheeks?  -P e n n y❤
Maaz: "WHY did we do this 8-hour hike?!"  Japhina: 💪😏💪✨️
I live in New Zealand
one time I went up mount baldy with my dog, my dad, and some of his friends (this was a few month ago) and it was pretty normal there was a lot of snow but we made it to the top so we went down a different way we went up it was a slow but more leveled way and then there was some people is full hiking gear with spiked shoes that said there was lice blocking the way and they couldn't go around it so we had so go back up the mountain even though we already walked down a big part of the mountain at this point I was so tired my dad encouraged me by saying if I don't keep on going we will die a slow and cold death so that inspired me to keep on going so we reached the top at night when it was dark even though we started hiking at the morning so we started going back down and by the time we were a little over half way to the bottom there was so sun the only light we had was from the stars the moon and one flashlight my dad had  so we were making good progress thankfully there weren't any animals that were feeling extra sadistic and wanted some human blood when we were at the middle my dog was super tired and he basically stopped moving so we had to lure him farther with jerky but when we ran out we tried to move him my hand but that didn't work because he was way too heavy so me some of my dad's friends and those people who had that hiking gear went down and went into there car to relax and warm up after a while my dad and one of those hiking people came back down and told my they had my dog but they really didn't and I was already thinking that they abandoned the dog so I was sad but prepared for that at my house my dad told be he tied him to a tree and put a bowl of water next to him and thankfully our dog is a husky so he has enough hair to survive the cold and the next day at 3:00 my dad went back to get him so he came back with our dog when J was already thinking our dog died so no one died and that's the end... yeah
the fact he said "what are you a doctor?" is ironic and hilarious
pause the vid at 8:38
Normall nz dub
its so nich to remember that people actually know about new Zealand, because a lot of people don’t know about where i live, anyways, next time u go if u go u should go to the north island of new zealand, and go to the hot pools with the amazing veiw, TOTALLY DONT KNOW WHERE IT IS,

I know you can do it maaz
He died 5 times this video
5:31 *about to die* *friend grabs checks*
scary but fun fact: the quote "my memories flashed before my eyes" is just really your brain go thru memories to find a situation similar to the situation your in right now and how you managed to save yourself and redo the same thing you did. so yeah
The end of the video literally made me cry :(((((((
Cause this whole video hurting my stomach and I can’t say I’m your name right sorry
What was used for the montage?
4:27
Why are you grabbing my cheeks killed me 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Si si si si no no no no
*laughs in Welsh*
Fun Fact my parents lived in New Zealand for about 3 years and that’s where my older brother was born
btw nice sheep joke bro there are more sheep in NZ than people
bro i LIVE in new zealand i dont relly know what ugly scenery is
so... who was the blurred peron in the end??
Troollll
that montage at the end really made me think of when my freinds and me get older and mabye part ways. It made me cry to think of never seeing them again. But it also reminded me of change. and how it can be good or for the better. so, thank you for reminding me of that.
4:24, people admire maaz for his goofy humour and art style, but look at this background!
My question during this whole video on how did he blend the coconut coconut🤣🤣🤣🤣
that was an amazing ending maz
12:00 *loud tears*
Celeste gamers
First the seas now the mountains what are we gonna get next a unicorn?!
😢😢😢😞😔
THE AMAXZINGA ISNT EVEN VERIFIED BAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHHA
White.
Did you go to Reefton
In summary Maz is dying on a hike he had never done
let the sheep take over
Huh i guess Maaz really Kneeded this hike ahahaha *EUGH*
[1:29]SIP
As someone who lives in New Zealand, I can confirm he didn’t exaggerate in any way.
Oh yeah that ending made me remember what it was like to have friends. How times change
Nice Video and all, but where did you freaking find a blender that can shred whole coconuts?!
Mazz I hat you u wanna know why cause a little bit of the ending was so much heart on me I was gonna burst to tears but I hold back😭😭😭
6:25 Dad?, hey yo guys, turn back we went the wrong way 😂
You say New Zealand weird
Lol I live in New Zealand
So, I just found your content and I have to say, you're right up there with theodds1out, ice cream sandwich and Jaiden! I've heard your stories about slowly accepting yourself as you are and all the hilarious adventures you've gotten into and man I have to say finding you was pure fortune! Never change my friend.
my dad walked nz
i live in nz and i bet you haven't seen 1% of the tracks
look at the picture to the right 10:55
I was born in there
What's the song at the end called?
Hey maaz ur gonna do residency?
Stop the vid and got to 8:38
8:36 Si has evolved into a- ........ oh CRAP-
Hay Maaz,what was the song you used at the end of the video? Love you’re videos keep up the good work!!!🥰
"We're on a mountain."
I live in New Zealand 👍🏻
0:33 W  H  I  T  E
As a boy scout, I can relate to the message that the people you're with can make a journey worth it. My friends and I have climbed mountains, ventured valleys, and braved raging rivers. And you know what? I couldn't ask for better scout brothers.
thanks for the vids
Watch. 8:35
We all love you very much Maaz! We are all staying AMaazing and happy. It really touches me that you care about us so much. I am a proud super Maartian btw.
Mount Rainer is even worse
That outro was kinda wholesome
10:55 I was looking at the background instead of maaz then I see something at the top right
#almostdied
What was the song at the end
I have been there
I live in NZ an I get a raise???
WHITE
So wonderful :')
that ending almost made me cry
*CHOO CHOO*
(๑•ᴗ•๑)♡ aww
At 8:39 when the guy transforms he looks like a certain um body part...
Ty I'm from new Zealand 😚😚😚😚

9:02 dnf
(“Drack why are touching my cheeks🤡”) best thing I have ever heard lol

What’s the song name?
Mazz pleas don't die!
I’m in New Zealand
You are a nice person 😍😍😍😍
I did it too
Oh my goodness, the knee commentaries makes me shiver
I climbed to the peak of mangere mountain on a burning day,the next day I couldn’t go to school bc my legs hurled SO BAD
SUPER EASY BARELY AN INCONVINIENCE 1:38
I’ve never had a desire to hike but now specifically because you said not to, fuck you i’m gonna climb that mountain someday.
I kept on asking myself why he did this until I saw the end!
8:39  ayo
Impressive that Maaz decided to prove his point about the bananas & coconuts by blending up his friends.
JAFINA, HAVING EXPERIENCE MEANS YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO MAKE SURE YOU DON'T DRAG THE NEWBIES ON A HIKE THEY AREN'T PREPARED FOR!
1:20 jojo referens?
I'm literally in Tears right now because of that Montage at the end. 😥😅
The title is kinda click bait-y but this was genuinely a great video. Hats off to you
I know this will probably never be looked at but what is the song that is played at the end of the video?
Maaz X James 😏
Does mazz live in New Zealand? I am new to this channel
He almost got isekai
the higher you get the thinner the air gets, making breathing but the second time you climb a mountain you’ll feel better because you will get used to it
Love the stories about New Zealand (◍•ᴗ•◍)
4:19 this dude has forgiving void on his Minecraft server
I've only been to like a few places in NZ (I was born here)
I was expecting I wonder what's up here oh its today sponsor
8:38 Haha
Haha you think that is bad I had to hike 20 miles for Boy Scouts
Goosebumps, this was a nice vid
His friends didnt care if he almost died and they just ignore it.
Maaz: Why are you grabbing my cheeks?
I'm from New Zealand so I'm going to take the praise. Edit I also love the video
I've been home sick all day and just started watching your vids this morning, they are awesome and I have really enjoyed watching them so thank you!
Honestly you guys where probably just hiking thru middle earth at that point
And actually why dont you have eyes?
I just noticed you kind of have an accent..
Wait…odd ones out with maaz in the end at 10:56
I just spent 30 minutes searching for this song WHATS THE SONG AT THE ENDS NAME??
8:35-8:47 Hahahaha!
lol
Don’t think I didn’t see that mafia picture >:)
8:39 ...imma just leave this here
This was such a cool video
Omg I live in New Zealand! And yes, THERE ARE ALOT OF SHEEP. the are 2 outside rn actually. 😂 but this was a very well made and entertaining video! Keep it up!
why did i do this- AHHHHHHHHHHH
Just noticed the potato eating potatos. Hmmmmmmm
just wholesome wholesome
The song at the end stuck with me so I looked it up and it is my favorite song now and when I shared the lyrics with my irl friends they responded with “ Aww, that is so sweet. Thanks a lot. Have a great rest of the week [irl name]” and “ Awww, that’s sweet :)”
Every friend you make you keep so you won't forget them, hope you find your friends:)
(sees the montage of him and his friends) “Great, now I’m crying”
I think there is more sheep than people in nz
all i could think about was “we’re on a mountain.”  relentlessly bullied by sultan
10:13 and you didn’t take any pictures
Bro I watched this a top of a mountain.
the mountain's name is "DRAGONSPINE"
It's terrifying how much sheep are in new Zealand
im not crying your crying
11:08
Ok but i feel a mix of banana and coconut flavor might actually be good. If anyone has ever tried something with that flavor please clue me in. Is it good?
I'm Too A Potato So If I Do Become A Story Time Tuber Some Day I'll Be Called Out From That Potato Character.
i like how when he's on the clip with his friends someone just flips him off in the backround
Me: ~ makes smoothie ~ MM SMOOTHIE  Maaz: ~ makes smoothie ~ see? w h i t e
I kin Cy/Sai.
Besides the sheep, Colorado has hiking, pristine forests, and natural hot springs :) Steamboat, strawberry, and Orient Land Trust are the ones I recommend.
What’s the ending songs name?
U almost friken! Died and got saved lol
It was a beautiful video... until the sponsor appeared lol
It’s not about the journey. But the friends we remembered along the way.
weak
How can one man be so funny and emotional in one video 🥺🥺
The sheep took Maaz’s knees
Thanks for calling NZ 🇳🇿 beautiful ❤️
I love the montage part of the video it was seriously so emotional
I love your videos thank make me happy
Just to say I had something very similar happen to me
Love the odd1sout picture at 10:54
An eight hour hike? That sounds like a nightmare.
As someone who lives in NZ i'd like to say     Ha short
WHAT HIKE DID YOU GO ON ZADDY
Spoiler alert!!: he died
I go hunting with my dad and brother in the badlands every year, which is basically a 8 hour very-difficult hike every day for two weeks. This is very relatable my goodness 😂   It's so beautiful, but umm... It's hard. It takes every ounce of my willpower to take each step 😆😅
TROLL
I went hiking with my family over the summer, and this mountain was one I had hiked 2x before and hated. It. Every. Time. But we went on it again and this time I did it completely barefoot… yeah, anyways my parents and little sister made it up about a quarter of the way, but my brother and I continued up, the way to the top was about 3hrs and we wanted to stop by a crash site on the way down, but as teens with no sense of direction, we got lost. For TWO HOURS. And we finally found our way back towards the top, and onto the trail down, we never saw the crash site but we made it back, to where my parents where waiting terrified Bc we had taken so long, and it was almost dark by the time we got down. Needless to say… ok there’s always a chance I do it again. It was horrible tho
i still remember that rap battle you vs timtom you said something like i have hands or something and little did you know you woold stop
You know its a very good treat for new Zealanders when they get metion at all in a show or in youtube. now im happy
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa it’s the shapfeaaaa get it 1:00
10:07 to 12:12 I'm sobbing
Now try a 3 day hike :D
This guy is good at making videos
i have turned on the bell and am a SUPER MAARTIAN!
This Truly AMaazing!
The last but was so heartwarming
tbh, I didn't really finish this video due to stressing out on hw but now that I have, this ending of this video really shined me. idk but this video was such a wholesum video. Thanks maaz
As a guy who has passed all of school from elementary to highschool alone like without much bullies and saddness. Its just kind of feels bad that i didnt get the people who would be friends with me like maaz and his amazing group. What a banger video  seriously
😳
There is an old rule where the slowest persen and the weakest Person goes first to walk at their own speed to be save. The other ones get to save their Energie and the first Person wont over estimate their own Power, that is one of the biggest risks.
Nearly cried when the music came on, as a kid I always wanted to have good human connections, it took 21years of my life to get that. I love seeing when others get that beautiful connection tho, it reminds me of my journey for freedom and love.(I’m also someone who loves seeing people be happy😅 don’t know if that makes me weird)
where maafia 3?
He so smol 🥺 (if your scrolling through the comments and see this THIS IS A JOKE )
I almost cried watching the end
Listen drax is a real homie
The real 8 hour extremely Dangerous  Trip are the friends we Made along the way 💀
That trip looks AMAZING (but I'd much prefer that 30 min mountain climb any day thank you)
New Zealand has some amazing views
Awww!!!
I live in that country
lol i'm from nz and totally agree with you
Completely forgot about this dude
The clips with all your friends at the end made me feel nostalgic about my friends
Maaz this reminded of a cartoon called kabrowski smh
Can we just have an out of context video of your hiking vlog? It seems like it would be such a fun watch
As a Welsh I’m very interested in the wildlife of New Zealand
According to his logic, you apparently fall from the sky as soon as you fall from a mountain
why were one of ur friends blurred out
What
tongariro crossing is my school camp 😂
I wish I had real friends to do stuff like this with...
Wow can’t believe this made me shed tears 😭
Misquotes?😨
all the name is missing is a "3:00 am CHALLENGE GONE WRONG!!!!!!"
You've just experienced your own Fellowship journey 😂
this is by far the most wholesome video i have seen from your channel <333
Last part got me good Or al least my emotions
Hey  I love this video good job ps I’m Australian
Who also thought that Kay looked like Brock from Pokémon
This is seriously so wholesome by the end, I want to have a super fun trip with friends like that
rip stamina
nz gang
YEAHHHHHHHHHHH NEW ZEALAND  YEAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
i have became a maartain [eyes glow white]
I'd of tripped over the first step on the way down and rolled to the bottom
question, why  do u not draw eyes?
5:10 reminds me of that one SomeThingElseYT video called "Conquering my fears like a champ"   Anyone else?
Damn, maaz went full on asmr mode in the end
Maaz is liquid. Maaz survived a high fall. Maaz is chaotic. Maaz is cat confirmed.
4:00 a m o g u s        7:31 also  B R U H
Can we Collab plz
the ending was beautiful. I feel U Maaz.

Osteoarthritis??? LEARNED ABOUT THAT A FEW WEEEKS AGO AND NOW I AM WATCHING THIS PERFECT TIMING!!??
Maaaaaaz I have a question when u get to the college did you felt like everyone was Shiny and amazing except your self and you need to pretend like you are someone else? Because I don't feel well 😔
I once cried and complained when I was climbing a small hill lol
Song name???
Imagine doing the hike with asthma... I'm tooootally not talking from experience hehehe... sh-shut up XD
The end got me crying and I still am- For 2 hours
I turned on the bell and am a SUPER MAARTION!
AH the last few minutes 😌
Yo he looks like the dad
What happened to the bananas and coconuts?
So Maaz, I have a theory of how your character was not dead:  Maaz died by diving in the ocean and got eaten by a purple whale to help Team Seas (#TeamSeas), and after that video, and as for myself, Puffy, feeling guilty about his death, in one of my sketching books in school, I drew Maaz as a ghost to remind myself about his tragic death. He died in December 2021, and was staying dead for 2 months, and then making Puffy drawing Maaz as a ghost. And because of his tragic death, he was unbelievably recovered, back to his normal self, like the way Bow was back to life in Inanimate Insanity Invitational, so I think the way Maaz escaped from the whale is that he killed it and faked his death in front of everyone, and my, face.
1 of the 1st rules of going on a trek: NEVER. WEAR. A. RED. SHIRT.
As soon as I saw the sheep I wished you luck.. I've done that walk many times always sometimes happens
Anime characters after getting hit in the stomach: 3:48

I know you're a youtuber who exaggerates things, I mean don't you have to to get money but having a hike crazy dad who sometimes brings me along this is pretty very super cringe but then again it's not everyday you see a ripped doctor
I love your vids so much ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Can you please do another mafia episode I really loved that
When ever you feel useless remember public bathrooms have toilets
THE END OF THIS VIDEO WAS SO CUTE
An  8 hour hike.....up a rocky mountian......in the rain........did....did she hate you?
Hi maaz: *COUGH COGN*  COOOOOOOOOCH
Awww the little clips at the end added to the sweetness of this video <3
1:36  "Super easy, barely an inconvenience!" -Ryan George.
as a local of New Zealand let me be late in congratulatring you for cxompleting nz number 1 torture trek
I wish I had friends to travel with 😔

Jafina slurping at 5:48 made me laugh so hard.

I’ve done this before and it’s pure pain
Drac why are you grabbing my cheeks
Nah the true reason maz went up the mountain is to say  we're on a mountain     (Go watch maz and sultan sketches video to understand)
U remind me of a friend,whos all talk but physical activity comes around and it always has to be focused on him so he doesn't die :)

Hey Maaz I’m trying to make animation videos but I don’t know how to install software and I don’t know what the best software is
were on a mountain
i did not expect to cry at the end. the wholesomeness... it really hit home. im sure they love you too maaz. life can get busy sometimes, but if anyone is reading this. im sure there is at least ONE friend you havent reached out to in a while, through no ones fault. but go ahead and just take this 1 second just to say "hi"   it will be worth it <3  stay amaazing guys!
Eyo what's the name of the song at the end?
This story was so interesting
Waw   I kinda love da corny jokes cuz ofc    but i love that u been happy with your freinds and thank u for entertaining us ^^

1:03 took “sheeple” to a whole new level
A while backe and my family were going to climb a mountain in Queenstown . Me and my sister didn't want to go because it was 5 hours and thankfully my mum said no bc me and my sister called it кака mountain (poo mountain I'm Russian btw)
8:38 this is hand animation. Every single frame is drawn by intention.  he drew a di-
When I was a kid I fell down a mountain almost broke my neck and nearly fell into a a bush of poison ivy, several cactus, and a bunch of FRIDGING thorn bushes
8:38 What an intresting shape!
Bro last part made me tear up-
SUS
Thank you so much for making these animations, they bring a smile to my face when I watch your videos. God bless ya may you stay safe in these hard times!
Aw, now I really want to go back and do that hike.  We were supposed to do it but then had to change plans because of dangerous weather conditions.
You have too do another Maffia they're so funny
Can you do mafia 3
8:42 (music) chug chug (music) chug chug BA DA BA BA BA DA BUM
I love my brain It just does his own thing, the only things I thought in the beginning were: fall blob blobn't
The end nearly made me cry lol love this animation and channel
Why am I crying 😭
PLAT TIME YEYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
Me and some mates did the Tongariro crossing and the 8 hour walk took us about 12
I don’t even have friends but that ending nearly got me crying 😭
No, you can’t stop me!
Thomaaz is back
This is too sweet,I really like this so much and you’re actually amazing!😄☺️
I'm making a animations and I want you to voice one of the characters
What can i say? Break a leg Maaz!
Omg YOUR ALIVE? I really thought that a ghost made this R.I.P
Fly high Maaz’s Knees 🕊
You just described Canada, except with smaller sheep
Wait why did you stop hanging out with them
Yaay
Drumb
Loved the ending
So, the real hike was the friends we made along the way?
What is the song at the end called
not maaz making me cry at the end😪
AMAAZING its very nice seeing people have good times
YAAAAAY HES BACKKKKK
thicc
11:07 whats that song called?
The fellowship of the bananas and coconuts
I miss them:      BY THE WAY WE HAVE A SPONSOR
00:27 rly took off a 180
Even though I can walk for a while with no issues, I will not go on an eight hour hike without some serious training for this.  This blows my mind that everyone agreed to this.  XD
When he said we went from the top of new Zealand to the bottom I immediately went " oh fuck- " cause I'm a kiwi and there are obstacles everywhere;-;
SHEP NOT SHEEP!
This sheep is insane
The ending kinda made me a little bit sad
i am dying of laughing... "See... WHITE!!!"
8:38 in 0.25x speed...
You can’t get rid of maaz, he comes back like a *boomerang* (get it)
Wait are the bananas and coconuts still toghether?
Every year after or before Christmas my family go on a trip to the upper part of NZ and one time my parents decided to do the Tongariro hike because they had done it before but this time they decided to do it with one of my mums friend and me and my brother. The hike up was horrible and at one point some dude actually slipped and fell off the track (luckily he only broke his arm and a helicopter helped him out). We also saw the big bluey green lake at the bottom. Which was wonderful. But going down was horrible, and indeed once we got back to our van our legs did feel like jelly. The rest of our trip was also great. We did see some geysers and hot springs and other stuff. (Just like Maaz showed in the montage)
When he showed. Video of exprience i thought there was just gonna be a potato
10:55 (Picture to the right) Umm… Maaz? Anything you would like to tell us?
I litteraly nearly died on this hike but we did the 3 day version which lead onto it
A yo why the transformation look like that though
that's some good bunch of coconuts and bananas you got there
Play mafia because the vengeful role hasn’t BEEN USED IN THE TWO EPISODES
w  h  i  t  e
Almost thought he was talking about Mount Everest
Yayyyyy you're back also goodbye mister khee you are dead😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑
I saw Picture of  you and James in the background😂🤣👍🇬🇧
Pls do mafia pt 3
0:59 Maaz needs our help!
See? WHITE
"you may be wondering, Maaz. Why did you go in this 8 hour hike?"  *ad plays*    REFRESHINGLY JUICY ORANGE JUICe
Maaz actually pulled a "it's the friends we made along the way" shit on us 😩😂
Fun fact: Mount Everest actually has frozen corpses of dead hikers up there. It is to dangerous for people to bring them down, so they are left up  there as markers for other hikers. The corpses actually become mummified because of the harsh conditions preserving them.
I also regret hiking on a mountain it was so long😨😱
10:56 excuse me look on the right
The real mountain were the frends we made along the way....
Ow
dad no!
THE REAL TREASURE WAS THE FRIENDS ALONG THE WAY
As a new Zealander as soon as i saw the sheep at the top i knew it was a nz alpine track, plus we dont get a lot of attention round here so this was good to see
It's always great to see local bands from your area getting recognized by a popular influencer like you, Maaz. I'm a fellow Polar Boys stan!   Love from Miami!!!
We don’t talk about the sheep cartel down in these parts of town
8:39    why did i see this
the real hike was the friends we made along the way
That almost death is my dream
I miss old zealand
HERE FROM THE POLAR BOYS !!!
Man! This was so wholesome!
wow cool i live in nz
The sheep uprising has begun
So fun fact, I own a backpack like that. The brand name is camelback and the thing that holds the water is called a bladder. :D
Was it mount Tongariro that you climbed?
1:24 SIMP WARNING XD
“Men don’t cry they are just robots”  Every guy crying at the end of the video Montage.
Is maaz ok because he sounds really sad at the end and he said hes a broken reck?
Stop trying to be poetic, you make me lonely that nobody will force me to do it
How did your legs feel the next day?!
The Bananas and Coconuts barely pushed on.  Their ranger persisted without hesitation, without sign of slowing down.  The rest of the party, however, were not so inclined to the rugged trials of traveling through the wilds.  Their wizard, in particular, began to succumb to exhaustion.  After wardrobe-related setbacks, perilous scrapes with death, and countless battles with the sheep-demons, the courageous heroes made one last valiant push, and their forced march paid off.  The party finally crossed Eight-Hour mountain, and reached the divine chariot on the other side.
An animal got violated in the name of sponsorship less than 20 seconds in. *This will be a good video.*
I wonder what actually happens when you get kidnapped by a sheep…
ppppPPPLLEEEASE TELL ME U REACHED OUT TO THEM THIS IS SAD
HAPPY B-DAY! :)
I live in New Zealand!
My name is Muaaz
I wish this video wasn't so underrated😅
Cool

Maaz is gooigi. <3
Maaz, i would love to see a final maafia video. Just an idea thrown out there!

The apples and water melons???
Sus
For anyone wondering The song is called Nothing has changed by The polar boys  thanks to bagel that I came across in the comment section.  but I digress, this video surely did entertain me and gave me good times cuz of the montage.  Live Long everyone, and create a journey that you are getting on to at the moment.
Imagine not being a super maartion
I'm not crying you are.
In the world of maaz  Everyone’s happy  And only 25 letters in alphabet  Why. U ask  There are no eyes
Happy birthday maaz 🤗
HAPPY BIRTHDAYYY!!!!!

I've tried doing my homework while playing your videos. They are too entertaining.
i hope that you can see them again
HELP I CAN'T UNSEE MAAZ LOWKEY LOOKING LIKE NASDAILY
No matter what this feels like the most saddest I’ve felt
You spent 8 hours on climbing?
8:38
I have hit the bell and now a SUPER MARTIAN
Ayo, I have rheumatoid arthritis Not from climbing and Is that a pic of you simping for odd boy lol
and i so happen to live in new zealand and have never been out of the country i love that we walk barefoot here and theres lots of beaches (at last got over my fear of swimming in really deep ocean water) and forests and hot springs and mountains and wheta's (a wheta is a giant bug sort of looks like a giant grasshopper they are pretty rare now days) i remember seeing a wheta on a tree. my opinion whetas are cute.   also my fave thing to do in this country is camping i love those loooong tramping/hiking trips and sleeping in a tent and picking berries and fishing. also learned how to get fresh water, so long as i have the right resources to do so. and sitting by a campfire with marshmallows at night telling creepy stories.
RIP to almost one year of the last voice chat podcast episode
really good
Ngl i thought this would be a video on Celeste lol
New Zealander here, as soon as you mentioned "Tongariro" I thought 'oh no'
so nobody's gonna talk about how maaz almost fell off a mountain?
Wait he was impressed by a camelback backpack? XD Love those things
AWWW THIS WAS SO SWEET, THAT MONTAGE AT THE END WAS SO CUUUUTE
Ok
Stop at exactly 8:39 and  looks like maz had a different idea of what he was going to be
i dont have friends so i hate this !!!!
"sheep yes lots of sheep" dont tell the Welsh that
Oh hey! Early!  Heh, cool.
trains trains trains trains trains trains trains trains trains trains trains trains trains trains trains trains trains trains trains trains trains trains
btw when are we taking control of the world fellow martiaans
Pathetic (lol) ive climbed many mountains.
The end made me tear up goshhh this was awesome
This is my first video of this animator and I have no idea who the potato is
11:20 Why does he have a comedically sized mallet.
to late i allready did
This is the real reason why Sultaan was laughing at "We're on a mountain". Man's so far ahead not just in Mafia, but can see the future
This is one of the only things that genuinely made me smile and laugh. Cheers man. Good vid as always
A shout-out to New Zealand 😁
<3
As a person living in NZ, I was sooooo happy when he said the words New Zealand
are they still friends?
Idk but that somber "arthritis" got me cackling. And idk why, like, I'm 19. 😭
do your friends know u call them bananas and coconuts
I remember when I was younger my mom went to New Zealand for a business trip and then I went with my dad and sister a few days later for a fun trip. My dad (the hiker that he is) recommended doing this with the whole family. My sister has asthma. We did do the whole thing but everyone kinda died inside (other than my dad)
Are you the banana or the coconut
The true 8 hour hike was the friends they made along the way.
*climbs dangerous mountain*
Have you lost contact with them? Or do you guys still hang out?
You put in the song
Why is maaz always getting slapped
Pause the video at 8:39
Why no one talking about he almost died
8:38   it looks like a (weener)
bnm
funny thing, I killed my legs playing soccer three days ago…
Im new here but your content is nice and relaxing
Wow that's a big mountain
BRO IF YOUR STILL IN CONTACT WITH THEM PLEASE DO A REACTION VIDEO LIKE WITH THE FRIEND ZONE SERIES
The end made me sad, he hasn't spoken to his old friends in a long time and he misses them so much
awwww that ending was wholesome, i will cry as a defense mechanism
I like accually have arthritis/rheumatism... And like i once did a hike like that and belive me ... I almost died and i couldn't move for 3 days lol
This video was so amazing I litteraly shed a tear
Did you go up wairere walls? that’s a nice place
Tongariro was my first ever trek up a mountain and it took 7 HOURS!! But it was an amazing trip with my classmates and I will hopefully return and do it all over again. Great to see you enjoyed this special part of New Zealand, Maaz :))
Does k remind anyone else of brock from pokemon
8 hour HIKE O_0
No knee gang!! Woo!!
*E*
I AM CRYING 😭
ez
whats the name of the outro song
Wow that montage of your friends was breathtaking.
Howcome my favorite youtuber are starting to do adventures in the wilderness videos? I love that but its surprising
please what software do you use to animate
Lol
No one seen the photo with Maaz and James (Theoddsonesout) at the end?
I would have died cause if a guy with actual kneez almost died me and my kneez that have a serious issue yeah I’m dead
I been here since the start of your videos
We're on a mountain
Drac means devil in romanian lol
hey maaz, I wanna know if u watch sharum ki sketchbook (an animator) since I've seen u speak some Urdu in ur streams so I feel like u might watch him
Did you see any keas?
E
My country its a hike country
But like go to El Salvador in el Trifinio is 20 kilometers 10 up and 10 back and it takes about 12 hours to climb
This is the song he used https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6nq0DtJstM it's nothing has changed by the polar boys
2:21 now I know what screen wrapping is like
thats so sweet
im playing as new zealand in conflict of nation ww3, and after three day, i have rule the wave
If no one understood,he comes back because it's like in jumanji
IM SORRY MAAZ BUT THIS IS A SUSPICIOUS SHAPE FOR ANIMATION FRAMES LOL 8:39
"My lack of knees came back to haunt me"   Pretty sure thats a new sentence
That didnt look so bad
the ending was sooo wholesome . and welcome back mazz and ty for giving us such an amaazing video
So much good right people 👌🙌👌🙌👌🙌👌🙌
when you're country gets mentioned in a video it makes you feel famous
at the end where maz gave a speech and the music started playing i felt like i just finished a movie with the heart warming music :D
You know what’s funny about the concept of hiking? Our ancestors would have literally just called this moving, to ya know, SURVIVE?!?!?! Now we do this for pleasure 🙃🙂.
0:46 it gets boring after a while, especially when your dad makes you go on multiple-hour bike rides daily
Jeffina must be from Utah
Man... I have no friends! BTW why does he blur someone?
how my good Maz in this old videos is a brown clone of my childhood friend AJ. one brown and there other Italian and gay but the look clones or palet swaps or something man that waerd.
I live in New Zealand lovely to see people care about us :)
yO MaAZ wHY ArE yoU cRyINg
I’ve done that hike and I live in new zealand
0:30  me after seen that white is impostor:IT WHITE   ...... AFTER VOTE WHITE......   maaz:SEE *WHITE*
That ending hits so hard even tho I dont know these ppl
Your smile during the montage says it all. Glad you felt alive Maaz. Hope you don't break your elbows next.
us art people. we don't like hikes.
This reminds me of the time i hiked up the cinder cone volcano at lassen national park. Great view and a not so bad hike
Celeste
Did u take pictures of the summet??! Showwww
You know what Maaz... You right it's not the Destination it's the Journey and the friends you make along the way. I'll do well to remember that
I LOVE NEW ZEALAND!!!!!!
Maaz: *Literally in a life or death scenario*  Also Maaz: "This video is sponsored by Curiosity Stream"
I just found out about your channel today, praying that hopefully I wouldn't get addicted to your vids.  Well shit.
that ending was very wholesome. Thanks Maaz.
Pause it here 2:49
Nice
For the third Maafia game, could you get "Youngyongtales" I think he would be an AMAAZING addition to the game!
8:39 at 0.5 speed lookin kinda sus 😩
_sheep starts doing a Fortnite dance_  Yeah, don't think I dind't spot YOU, buddy!
R.I.P Legs but not going to lie the scene in squid game in red light green light reminded me when maaz's friend saved him.
That ending was wholesome 😭 crying rn
You know, it's kind of sad that one person had to be blurred out during the part where everyone is shown to be enjoying the time of their lives despite that being the request she herself made.  Makes for a mytery/horror movie plot.
It’s not just a cult❣ITS A FAMILY❣
2:21 funny from maaz XDDDD
Why did I think this was gonna be a playthrough of Celeste
To be honest I would of became a train to down the mountain
7:42 Alex from Minecraft when she drinks Strength II
i will now climb it Maaz
The fact he said demons souls boss instead of dark souls boss...... PS5 privelage, i wish i had that
Sus
Its about the friends you made together
that cute
What can I say Maaz, the puns in this video were pretty… *corn knee*
3:15 sing refrece?
Hike more like bike   haha :(
Why is there a picture of Mazz with hearts and blush and the there's James next to him???
You should react to some 5-minute crafts videos and debunk them cuz your medical professional like Doctor Mike another YouTuber does that
Happy ending no one's dies :)
When you fall down a mountain like that you wouldn't lose and then just do that you would die without quick medical help
Man I hope one day I can make such MESTERPIECE
I saw the thumbnail and I'm like, "Maaz what have you done now?!" XD
p o g  :))))))))))
Those pesky mountains, stealing people’s knees
This video seems familiar... 4:30-4:38 OH!
Omg the montage at the end was so heartwarming
Maaz you had me choking the jokes in the video almost killed me how do you do it
Amazing video dude Anyone else wondering why only person is completely blurred?
9:01 Maaz the tank engine coming through
9:48 no joke minecraft loading screen music started when this happened
5:31 drac why are you grabbing my cheeks? Drac: :troll:
I didn’t need to cry at the end thanks Mazz /hj
Maaz: *Almost dies* Also Maaz: *makes a joke about it*
HE KNOWS TO MUCH
Thomas the tank engine made me break down infront of my mom
This was just too cute man <3
the real fun was the friends we made along the way
I love the ending
Dude you are a psychopath
thank you boosted my mentel helth 😃☺👍
This vid was all fun and games until the end where I didn't take it seriously initially; but then, the compilation started and I actually teared up a bit. Trips like that last forever in memories
The ending really got to me I thought it would be a meme or something but it really got to me
For a girl maaz
1 day late
Maaz. I can't get a SECOND subscription to CuriosityStream/Nebula. I have to wait until like.. May.
This reminds me of the time I went on a hike when I was 12(ish). It was only an hour, buuut I had a hairline fracture on my shoulder for the entire thing. Needless to say my family and I will never forget that hike😂👍 hikes certainly build character and memories!
Hmmm... The Odd Person Out mentioned mountain climbing...
What is the song in the end?
Hola hi
I though you were going to play Getting Over it by Bennett Fody
Im not crying at the end!! YOU ARE 🥺
Imagine the day.  You're a mountain climber with 2 children. One is 18, and the other is 9. Today was the big day, you and Sarah are going mountain climbing. 4:15 P.M, and you start climbing.  Whilst climbing, you see 0:01. You decide to reschedule, for a lifetime.
Wholesome and funny ✌️
Had to say this, As a bangladeshi girl damn maam whats your ethnicity
Is this a Celeste rewiwe?
Every day, my desire to go hiking increases more and more. This video isn't an exception to that >>
Yeah thomas
8:38 😳
I need it 🤣😂🤣🤣🤣😂🤣
IM SO HAPPY AND JUST LIKE EXICTED BC MAAZ USED NOTHING HAS CHANGED AND ITS ONE OF MY FAV SONGS EVER AND NO ONE IK HAS HEARD THAT SONG BEFORE AND IT PERFECTLY MATCHES MY FRIEND GROUP TOO AND IM GASPING BC IM SO HAPPYYYYYY
When your freind got your back 4:33
bro, one of your friends is just a blur. that's strange.
Maaz i re watched your video about being brow   MAAZ i DID NOT know that you were a muslim at all unlike you going from Pakistan to Japan to New zealand . Bro i thought i was the only person who just goes to youtube whilst being a Muslim and Brown
It is not deez nuts its DEEEZ KNEEEES

11:41 Damn we cant even get to see that persons drip
My guy thinks a camel pack is hard to get
😭👌
You look like a assistant teacher I had named mr Joel
视频很棒，我居然可以听懂
Thank you SO much for pronouncing the names of our mountains properly here, not many people say it correctly or just call it by their colonised names. It means a lot <3
Omg i did this hike holy crap, im from nz btw
Buy yourself some proper pants man  XD
Absolutely loved this video!! The ending montage was just fantastic!! :D
You nearly died because you simped
AMAAZING video
That's underated
Dang Maaz honestly super moving video I never comment on videos but gosh dam is this a moving video keep up the good work we'll all be here to see you keep growing
I have several friends nicknamed Potato XD
That mountain got to see more cheeks than me. Also dang this was wholesome and I love it!      Kachaw
Maaz, are you legit okay? The knee thing sounds so painful
10:55 sus picks
Maaz making me wanna go on a hike
One Piece ending vibe on the end
I almost feel like I heard a d&d campaign
When you animated her using her pack to slide down the mountain, I got a skateboard commercial right after
rip bozo
Wait......IS THAT A PITCH MEETING REFERENCE AT 1:39 ??
You could have spent 8 hours doing normal stuff, and by which I mean sleeping. But no, you got nothing but deletion of your knees (serious bit, get well soon)
Sometimes I forget Maaz is Aussie so he would know what NZ is
11:07 Love this song!!
1000 comment
1000th
How did he not call the potato a croquette
Best video yet 11:07 What song was that?
What song is used at the end?(  also maaz is amaazing)
H       H            J         I           H             H       H      H      H           H     H             H       H
The ending was so sweet!
On
Drac more like Draco the hero :P Give him all the mayo he deserves
damn who's cutting onions here :') lovely video maaz, it truly shows how good you are at story telling, specially when the story includes loved ones!
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ / 5 _Great ending sequence!_
sus 8:39
this is so wholesome, may you and your friends stay strong togetha<3
wow, this was definitely one of maaz's best video 👍 I really enjoyed this video. Thanks soo much :D
if you have friends like this... WHAT HOPE DO I HAVE
You and James' timings are impeccable.
Ok really if you ever go to my home country new zealand again I would love to meet you at the north island because it would be great 👍
Damn bro, your videos are starting to look professional
8:38 💀
Idk man I'd rather just look up a picture online and laugh with my friends that someone went on that hike, same achievements but no walking XD
This was an amazing video and the ending is beautiful  REACH OUT TO THEM DUDE
I love living in New Zealand. :) Sounds like you had a great time with your friends. The flashback at the end got me mentally in tears.
hiking downwards is pure pain, it hurts your toes so much
Anyone else sad at the end cuz you don’t have friends?
ayooo ryan george referance much???
I wanted to show someone who needs the help of all of us this little invalid person and his legs don't work and still see how he does https://youtu.be/k9nYP8zyIKM😭😭
These mountains ain’t no match for Wizard Maaz! He could just obloiterate the mountain! 😁
see?          *W H I T E*
🤎
We went on a two hour hike and I felt just like him
Wholesome story 🥺
This got me in the feels omg
This was a great video!
That was genuinely the most beautiful outro I've ever seen
This was so fun and sowholesome at the same time
Aw ☹️
This sounds amazing, Maaz! ❤️ I'm so proud of you and I'm so happy you had this experience!   Ah Maaz, don't make me cry! 🥲 I missed you too! So Happy to see another video from you!
This brings me back to nearly dying trying to climb mountains in Boy Scouts. Fun times
The frames of that dude turning into a train was sus
That wood hammer was cool
As someone who lives on a mountain. I feel you dude. Who needs knees?
Nice tribute at the end✨✨
2:13 Aww- all of this is adorable
Plot twist: This is actually a ghost making the video and him and his friends spirits are trapped on the mountain. M night shyamalan: 👏👏Yes
I was surprised to find out Potato was a girl this whole time.
Aww that ending was wonderful <3  Hopefully your friends know how much you appreciate them 😌
My legs are killings me as we speak from a huge leg workout. This hurts from my soul 😂
the song at the end is called nothing has changed by the polar boys :D
8:23 isn’t that dangerous to do just that scene specifically
Hehehehe
OH COME ON SHEEP!!
When I was 5 we went to blue mountain climbed up a 3 hour hill to get the best grilled cheese and rode a chair lift down but eventually they got rid of the stand and we never went there again
Can't you just call them?
The moral is literally "the real journey was the friends we made along the way", but it works! I'm so happy for you all, Maaz!
Hey maaz hope your doing good I am an up and coming youtuber and animator and lots of others but I just want some tips you don't have to reply but I just am really excited to make funny stories like you
8:43 - Thomas Gon Give It To ya
This was sweet and the scenery looked so beautiful. If I ever go to this spot, I won't climb the mountain lol And congrats on this vid making the trend list.
Are we not going to talk about this photo 10:55 in the corner
8:38 what the hell..
1:29 this is called a camel back
I guess we should reccomended Welsh to visit there because of the sheep.
That last part with the song over the video with your friends almost made me cry I miss my friends
@TheAMaazing HELLO MAAZ, IM FROM NEW ZEALAND AND HAVE DONE THE TONGORIRO CROSSING WITH SCOUTS, We had to drive up from wellington the day before and left at 5pm and got to one of the towns near by at 11.00pm. Then we had to get ready for the next day so we only got to bed at 1.00am and had to wake up at 6.00am to do the walk. We found it really fun until the end. We got to the bit where you have to go down the winding stupid down hill and then into the bush, we hadn't seen a kilometer mark in ages and stopped as we had know idea how far we had to go, we all refer to this as the panic picnic cause we we finished eating and kept going we saw a sign saying you have 400meters to go! then when we finaly got to the end we had to wait an hour for our leaders to go get the other car 😂. Overall it was an amazing trip although the uphills were awful.
AYO? MAAZ x JAMES?
WHY ARE THERE SO MANY 🐑
Maaz lungs are complete Doodoo are you live where you can see the city from where I live And I am 11
That’s unfair you can’t just make me cry at the end
That one at the end that got slapped in the face, yes that one,  I'm shipping you both ok. I'd try him myself if it wasn't the other side of the world so all i can do is simp, hot peace of cake
As a kiwi I can confirm that 8 hr hikes in nz are the worst. Also the mountains are one of the most dangerous things in this country- so congratulations on surviving!
omf nothing has changed by the polar boys
Yay maaz did it
dude i live in NZ to be fair sheep at this point are going to become prime minister or something ;-;
I DONT WARE MASK OR HAV VACINE AN U CANT MAKE ME
Agreed
Sheep
Cool stuff
Fantastic video! Your videos are so awesome and fun to watch. Keep up the good work!
Idea for maafia . The demon a mafia that if obliterated can ‘kill one last soul’ or basically a mafia that has the vengeful Martian ability
I wonder how many of these jokes were written by James…….
New upload from Maaz, James, AND, Adam, New episode of Demon slayer, and, new episode of Attack On Titan. Best Day Ever.
I live in NZ
OMG  I LIVE IN THE  NEAREST TOWN TONGARIRO AAAAAAAAAAAA
the sheep in the start reminds me of when i was in minecraft and i climbed a mountain and it pushed me of when i was looking at the view...     i didnt have keep inventory on....
my dad's a mountain climber !
awww at least you have friends
Everyone a random person is calling me help!!! what do I do!??
Great Adventures by Spider Man against All Crimes in New York city https://youtube.com/channel/UCv5Ns7tvIeskcvcMCLvuWkg
I think 80% of the video is just him dying.
Dammit Maaz 😭 it's only 12pm and I'm getting emotional
the ending epilogue is sooo good and the ghost made it even better
what if he actually died, what would be happen to this channel then
Wait what was that picture behind u at the end with all of those youtubers? If you actually make that video i will be so happy
Hilarious video good job
bro this hit right in the heart wtf !!
this video made me realize that we need to enjoy every second of our life and living life to the fullest as soon or later, we'll pass on.
Me and my family like ALL of my family went on hikes so much this last summer so much to the point where I had nightmares of hiking
that end sequence, how is it possible that I am feeling nostalgic FOR YOU?
Why the sheep 🐑 but this vid is going to be cool
can't believe he listens to the polar boys
COOL
This vid is perfection
The ending seems like the end of a good series of a show and I want to cry over it.
I MISS U TOOO
19
I found out that this is the worst sport for me
Why does it show two videos? Is it the preview and the video? Cuz I see no purpose in posting both when they’re exactly the same
Awww Maaz, I 100% can relate to this. I had extremely similar experiences when I worked in Yellowstone National Park for 3 months. The nostalgia we get from these moments is so powerful!
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This Brought me some Nostalgia :O Hikes are a ton of fun with people you enjoy. :P I don't think I enjoyed my Dad, only because he would joke about cliffs, but that's in the past. So ya, this scared me a bit. I'm glad it was nice time with yer friends. :D
Rip knees
Drak just saved us content #LESGODRAK
I made a crossbow
This is so good my knees started hurting
I climbed a mountain and nearly died this is why I don't climbed mountains
no one can tell me that the jafenas water bottle sounds like the water tube from the dentist
You were great at the personal narratives assigned by English teachers    Legit great video 💕
Kaye is like on of my besties, latte. Like bruh i got sad last Thursday for some reason and she literally let me cry on her shoulder and shes so caring and like not me nor any of my other two besties deserve her waaaaa
Wow
This sounds like fun
The ending of this video got me in the feels
FINALLY YOU’RE POSTING :D
Super video
Hj
I love the friendship in this vid I'm crying 😖:')
So that she can SIP
✨Yay a new video for the best of the best, TheAMaazing 🎉✨
this is making me doubt if im a good friend.. hmm...  *muffled but audible* HEY GUYS WE'RE GOING ON A HIKE PACK YOU S$*&
Idk if it was a Hitchhiker's guide reference or not, but I chuckled when you said you brought just a towel
8:39 is that....
In the end it was about the friends we made along the way.
https://youtu.be/P4NgCcNukoc A video saying stuff even more about this
This video repeatedly implies that Maaz now has plot armor.
i guess he KNEE-D stamina for his knees
I did that hike a couple of years ago with my family. Some parts are extremally steep and narrow. Some parts doesn't even have a real path! Just some loose sand and gravel while you walk down this super steep part with no real footing... D:
the final part of the video is soo nostalgic....and i didn´t even was there
Draco is sus   Draco why you grabbing my cheeks   Haha stares at him intensley
So, the star on your polo is for you turning into a wizard?
i feel like no one’s talking about the fact that this is so emotional even tho these aren’t even my memories.
Wowie you climed a mountain
Rip Maaz's knees
good video maaz
I like how you almost died and yet were worried about a ripped pant
You made me cry at the end with that video of you guys hanging out
Ok
We’re on a mountain
is there like a extended vlog of the trip besides what fine ass recordings we got on the end it looked like soooo much funn
Yep, gotta keep in mind climbing is the easy part. Going down is much harder
Auughh, the pain, it hurts, I want a friend group like this but I have no friends to hang out with
1:07 there is no such thing as too much sheep. And I am definitely a human saying these things. I am totally not a sheep and am definitely a human.
This version lord of the rings looks awesome. Cool vid sir.
10:55 the picture  in the background sus
The real friendship was the knees we lost along the way. Or something like that
The ending collage with that song was so cheesy it reminded me of a disney movie but i loved it
The little Friendship montage was adorable.Change my mind
This reminds me of when I climbed Ben Lomond, showed up wildly unprepared, not the right clothes or anything. We got to the top "Fine" but just after starting the descent my shoe literally crumbled and fell apart, meaning I had to make my way back down without shoes (it was safer to take the other one off)   I don't recommend it, always be prepared
Just gonna put this down now...   My class did the same crossing in year 6
Great
I have covid at feb 10 i will get the vaccine for kids in 9 years old i really liked youre vids i started watching since 2020 i was hiding in a washing machine cardboard box while i was scrolling on youtube i saw youre vid and i showed it to my friends that was that start
ok
AAA the end is so wholesome
I started crying WHY
I'm sensitive, almost made me cry at the end with such a beautiful friendship
Wolfie: yes I have affected maaz with the wholesome virus
Very true. Moments like these make you think that even tough times were worth struggling through, because your friends were there for you.
Beautiful
8:40 this is gold
Kaye reminds me of Brock from Pokémon for some reason
Hi i just came across your channel and i saw the vid and in the intro you said “Hi i’m Maaz”…….and i replayed it 3 times to see if i hear it right then i googled you at it turns out WE HAVE THE SAME NAME!!!!! I’M MAAZ KHAN TOOOOO!!!! gosh that is such an amazing coincidence!!! I’ve never heard of anyone else with the name MAAZ……it’s not that common in India.    By the way i really like your animation it’s really nice, you probably won’t read a comment this long but i had to shoot my shot.  Okay i’m done😂
Me: Mt.Ebott be like
I love your videos
✨The real hike is the friends we made along the way ✨
So THIS is the Video that Thomas the Tank Engine Meme was Used for... LOL
Is it just me or Maaz keeps getting better and better.
Sheep Mafia Is To Blame For This
When you watched Maaz because you want a good laugh but you end up crying by this masterpiece 😭 (jk all your vids are a masterpiece)
Wholesome 101
Th real hike was the friends we made along the way
"the real treasure was the arthritis we got along the way"
1:06 CALL THE FBI WE NEED HELP!
Man what the heelll, I just moved from New Zealand to Australia thinking yes I will be like in the same country as maazes stories now I'm in Australia ur telling New Zealand storeys
I came back from hiking, good to know
He literally just regenerated
Steep Steps. Yeah that's NZ, I've always wondered what reason we do this, as most trail runs that i've done always force me to slow down as the steps just get steeper and thinner. If it rained recently then someone will slip, seen it happen to others and myself as well, it just becomes a muddy slide that you can't stop until you reach the bottom.   Ahh New Zealand, The place to train your legs and rekt your knees :D
ive done this track, absolutly incredible
I really enjoyed the video especially the section that was IRL with your friends. I hope you’re doing well Maaz. You and your channel are fantastic!
Damn yall out here making friends at uni? :,)
10/10 for the end of the video
Maybe I'm a little early today 😆 🤣
AAAA THE HEART TINGLES
So wholesome 🥺
8:38
"are you a doctor? HEhEhE!"   *I thought you were one though...*
I’m glad you liked our country, Maaz! Our intermediate (year 7-8) school takes a select few year 8 students up the tongariro crossing every year and it was the best! I’m sorry you didn’t get to experience it to the fullest.
tùpjif
lol same
this video just came on the best time for me, I went to a heavily snowy place yesterday, the snow was deep, and my inexperience with snow(it doesnt snow where I live) made it worse, my hands were freezing, my legs were tired and freezing, breathing was awfully bad, and I legit rolled 30 meters laying upside down while freezing and not trying to get uncheerful. Then I came back to my nice, not snowy, warm home and slept.
Good idea on the stretching muscles part. I learned it not long ago that you shouldn't just rest after you are absolutely exhauseted.
i guess the real summit was the friends we made along the way
Wait,you were swiming in mayo?
I was born and live in NZ, and this video made me really happy lmao, I'm glad you enjoyed your time here (although RIP your knees haha). One of my best friends did the Tongariro Crossing a few years ago for an Intermediate camp in Year 7, she had to go to school the next day and her feet were dying poor thing. And hey dont come at us for sheep, at least we dont have snakes like SOMEONE /j
...
When I saw the good times you had with your friends, It made me remember everything I did with my friends before covid happened. I still havent seen them to this day. Its almost 2 years now since i last saw them. 🙁🙁
10:55 *sees picture on the right* AYO WHAT THE F#@%
Hmmmmm ...... New Zealand sounds A LOT like Czech Republick hmmmmm
I looked back at your videos and saw you briefly talked about New Zealand and sheep as if you were foreshadowing the current video from the previous one. Talk about a really close coincidence am I right?
Yo future me when u see this I want u to never forget ur freinds and this message goes out to everyone
Wat
MAAZ THIS VIDEO IS AWOSEME ! Why you not post a video in 2022
Damn....and we thought the Covid was the worst for some doctors......
Am i the only one who thought of Celeste when I saw the title?
Yes! I remember that ripped pants 👖 video before and I loved it so much that it’s one of my favorite funny AMaazing videos somehow! Also, another great hiking animated video here so good job man ok 😁👍 haha!
Wow, nice video mate... Really enjoyed it
They sound amazing maz. I bet they still think about you too
5:31 "drack, why are you grabbing my cheeks?" -Maaz 2022    i really love the trip videos! take care and have fun too maaz! :]
Are u still a doctor
I was REALLY surprised about the huge turn this video went on the end! Another great video Maaz!!
Lovely video, you always seem to know when I need an upload somehow XD
this happened to me on a four mile punishment walk because I was “selfish” (i was just a bit ahead) and since I stupidly wore crocs, They rubbed into the skin on my ankles. after I took off my shoes, I was mortified. I saw my flesh where my ankle is.
Maaz, gonna come to Auckland some day?
MAAZ YOUR A DOCTOR 😭
K kinda looks like the dude from the first Pokemon series ngl :0
fall guys?
This is going to make me cry :'3
“We’re on a Mountain maz we’re on a mountain”
What can I get nebula on
Maaz being heart warming ewwwwwwwww
yay thomas the tank engine joke! my favorite!
This is too much exercise
" you lose some you get some" I sounds familiar 😁
Maaz becoming a player of the Jumanji movie by being thrown down and respawning from the sky!😂😂
Omg "this might not be foreshadowing for an upcoming video" https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=hP2c76ZeHaE
YOURE ALIVE!!!
8:23 ayo that air tube looks like its connecting to something sus 😳
Golly heck mate. Nobody just does the Tongariro without being prepared! But good on ya and ya mates! Hoping to go one day myself!
The art on this video was amazing 🤩🤯
Ok jokes aside,this was a really nice video and I also miss hanging with my friends. I actually nearly cried 🥺 Edit: time stamp for the ending montage: 11:05
Not gonna lie, kinda wanna climb this mountain now
Maybe the real journey was the memories we made along the way
When I saw he posted I gasped out of excitement and shock. Also why did it take me half the video to type this
One time I hiked the tallest peak in my state with my dad and his friends (I was like 11) and when we got to the top we just… stood there… and then got out some ring pops… had those, and went back down and went home. It was fun, but when I explain it I don’t understand why it was so appealing.
New Zealand is beautiful. I would know... Because I live there.
Thanks maaz hope you're doing well.
Damn, I wish I had friends
It's the friends that you make along the way
PLEASE, WE NEED A BANANAS AND COCONUTS REUNION, PLEASE
Is it Mount Neverrest?
This reminds me of the time I did a hike in Glacier National Park with my family! We started hiking pretty in the morning (I think around 6-8 am?) and got back at 4ish. My dad forgot to pack the sandwiches so you better believe I went straight to the cooler where they were bing imprisoned when we got back to the car! My legs felt like complete jelly and I was sooo sore the next day lmaooo Edit: I forgot to mention that there was a shorter way to the top…I was so angry-
the end was so cute lol 11:04
I don't care how good of friends i am with someone, there is no way i'd go on an 8 hour hike. I'd be like "See y'all later I'm gonna be your lifeline so that if you go missing I can send the police after you in hopes to save you in time." that would be me.
Yay new video!!! :)
Let’s talk about the ending, that was beautiful and I’m crying ✋✨😫✨✋
Took 8 hours to get up the mountain took 8 hours for me to fine the vid lol
Too wholesome.   I just got diabeatus
I agree...I honestly can say that your goal wasn't to reach your destination...it was more like to make those precious memories with your closest friends... (Definitely one of the best videos that you've made till now...)
I got here in eight hours when this was posted 😅
Was this in gensin impact?
What a beautiful video for you and your friends
God damn it why did I get hit in the feels at the end-   Amazing overall video tho!
The video is amazing but I really wanna know what's the title of the end song
When Maaz said "why did you go on a 8 hour hike" I thought he was going to whisper, " *because the sheep made us* "
That'd my country
For me the video was also 8 hours ago (upload)
I’m done 😅
Now we know where you live
643rd!
Ok why did the ending make me cry? 😭
And then there’s a walk that takes 4 months
Yeah no, count me out. I don’t care how much I love my friends and family. Hiking on a dangerous, wet, mountains for 8hrs?!?! No thank u! 😂😂😂
However didn't like the video deserves death sentence 😤
That Thomas the tank engine moment is the strangest and the most beautiful thing I have ever seen
Idk why but this video is so nostalgic to make me cry
Big backpacking fan right here, tip for hiking down hill for a long time without killing yours legs is to walk backwards. Always have someone behind you to watch where your going tho
Wait- they are all still friends right?
ayo maaz, why is your group called the bananas and coconuts but tato is a potato
Maaz cant make you cry. Surely he cant make you cry... *athletic friendship bros sob*
This was probably one of my favorite videos of yours. Solely because of the ending. Everything lead up perfectly to it. Thank you for this experience.
*sniffles* that's beautiful 😭
:0
Deltarune be like
what is the song at 11:07
Ok I’m gonna be honest, the end of the vid hit me really hard. I have a real small group of friends I met online during the pandemic and we’ve been really close ever since. We may have never gotten to see each other in person but having them in my life has gotten me through a lot these past few years. Loved this video keep it up Maaz!
Hm
Hey maaz for mafia use some other youtubers like jadenanimation, timtom, wolfechu, and somethingelesYT, brewstewfilmes
this video is the best so far
love your stuff still i hope u still are enoying your life
the little vlog edit at the end is so sweet! And it’s beautiful as well. hope they’re doing well as well :)
Banger Video
Why am I crying, I don't even know these people
why did the ending make me cry  SOMEBODY GET ME SOME FREINDS ;-;
Devils staircase is the bomb!
The final montage is exactly what I want in college, a bunch of cool life long friends that u can hav adventures with.
Maybe the real mountain, were the friends we made along the way...
Everytime maz says " why did I do this " then the macular woman showed up .
10:54 AYO THE LEFT PICTURE IS KINDA SUS
Love ur vids
The sheeps are basically concouring mongolia as well like AAA
i suck at hiking lol
Not gonna lie this shit was fucken beutifull so dan beutifull it almost made me cry
What’s the music called that started at 11:08?
4:21 how is this joke still funny jajaja XD
I feel sad that you always get abused in your animations
The ending to this video was so nice
It wasn't about the hike itself, but about the friends we kept along the way
3:16 tell that to Matpat
Do another maafia
69k views
8:37 Did you guys see anything?
Duct Tape fixes everything 🦆👖
I love how your really care for your friends
Maaz, that's  dangerous
maaz straight up found middle earth on that mountain
so great
awwwwwww
I think this is my fav video but I like all the videos that you make 😌😄
*climbs*
Les go new vid
I thought he met he went to mountain Everest
Maaz's videos are always worth the wait keep up the glorious content always makes the day better.
8:39   you're welcome
It is so shocking how wholesome the end came to, especially for a Maz video
Wow
E
glad maaz was able to make friends at school
The end makes me feel really happy
Two questions one what’s your favorite video game? Two what’s the color of your tooth brush ps(mine’s purple)
Heheheheehhe......  White in the inside
where you go in nz
🤎🤎🤎
damn si is definitely me
I think I'm getting the hint that you want to strengthen our friendship by hiking together, Maaz
GUYS MAAZ IS TRYING TO TELL US SOMETHING!……..     We need to stop the sheep organization from ruling the world
What the hell are these bizarre running gags you set up?
Let me ask you. Were you the one that came up with the joke about dumb hiking videos for James?
Dang Maaz, never cried during one of your videos that changes now 💙
SHEEP
I cannot believe you put A Thomas And friends refrence. And I’m a Thomas fan. You’re missing his short stumpy dome.
8:28 That transformation scene seems.... quite suspicious for a few frames...
I recently came positive with covid and this video really cheered me up thank you maz for your videos
1:24 It's called a bladder and I can't think of a grosser name to call it. Very handy little things however
first time I went up a mountain, I was under prepared, the dudes leading the trip have me a mountain jacket, but didn't tell me not to bring jeans. that was hell
A
Man talk about a leg day . I wouldn’t do this hike. Man why did you do this 8 hour hike :) XD
Friends are cool and stuff
Ayooo did u saw the picture
ohh no maazes knees are broken
For once I'm early
Jeffina is crazy. She’s like the living embodiment of the Buffsuki meme from DDLC!
Wait why doesn't this have more views?
Why's one of your friends blurred?        If you don't mind me asking
This Made me cry for alot of reasons.
New Zealand? Don’t you mean the set of Lord of the Rings that just formed its own country? Like how the set of Napoleon Dynamite formed into the state of Idaho?
I remember doing this for a class trip as we had to study the natural environment but everyone got too tired and demotivated to do so
hope your ok maaz :D!
"The real mountain is the friends we made along the way"
The climb is real
Where have you been MAAZ?
Go to 0:20 the sound effect is so weird
Not Maaz making me cry a Lil and miss my friends
So this is the forshadowed vid
That final part of the video when you show some parts of your trip was so beautiful, i hope all of you guys are doing well, and someday you can make new and happy experiences, have a good night and stay amaazing
this is a good storytelling
If there is a New Zealand.  .  . Where is . . . Old Zealand???
A perfect biomes doesnt exis..
"The real treasure was the friends we made along the way"
Aww what a cute end!
Hahaha
Sultan: *cackles* wE'rE oN a MoUnTaIn, MaAz!!!
I wasn't expecting such a heartfelt moment there at the end, made me feel fuzzy inside.  also i can't STAND with ur leg puns.
As a kiwi myself, I can comfirm the sheep are in fact taking over our country
Came here to laugh and now I’m leaving crying😓
Is no one gonna talk about that massive wooden hammer?!? Like my man probably split New Zealand in two when he struck the ground!
This is a nice video 10 out of 10
Good job for enduring the hike Maaz!
After going on a 8 hour hike I can definitely say, I'm never going back; Yea the sights are amazing and beautiful but holy cow my entire body was sore and my legs were dead
Learn us how to draw some ASSES (i am not joking)
I guess it wasn't a simple walk to Mordor for you!
The real mountain were the friends we made along the way
Imagine having friends as good as maaz's
Im so grateful i can call NZ home❤
I am kiwi I was born in New Zealand I agree it’s one of the most beautiful places ever
What’s the song playing at the end of the video
7:20 am I seeing wrong or drac has 3 eyebrows?
Sounds miserable, I like that. I wanna try
We did a similar hike a few years ago, it took us 3-4 hours to climb up this mountain and only 2 hours to get down. Because we just CHARGED down this mountain, flued by the need to get back to the car. Totally worth it, would do again.
That end music was nice what’s it called?
12:31 bfdi mouth
Hello Maaz
sheep
Love you bro 👊🏻😎
I just turned on my tablet then this came out
Put an F in the chat for Maaz’s missed knees
I loved that compilation at the end keep up the good work m8 :)
😭😭😭😭😭it's sooo beautiful I'm actually crying
It's like the Fellowship of Maaz climbed Mount Doom together! Depth of connection can truly be proportional to the trials survived together, and a climb like that with beauty at the top is the perfect parallel to climbing through med school with colleague/friends 💙 (can relate!) Best to y'all as you confront new heights!
Hey, I did that exact hike with my family when we were in New zealand!
I thought that you climbed Dragonspine- (Dragonspine is a mountain in Genshin Impact)
celeste
That music at the end got me
I wanna do something like this       But I don't have friends 😐
I think this is the first time I shed a tear on Maaz's video.
You were once a hiker but you've broken your knees.
James and the maaz uploading in the same day? Impossible
I was not expecting to be laughing one minute and hit in the feels the next. That place looked truly beautiful, but I don’t think I could put that pressure on my knees to get me there-
amaazing video
This was such a nice and heartwarming video to watch
Im not crying. You are.
Aww! Nice video compilation with everybody!.
the chances of being killed by a sheep is low.....             but never zero.....
(Splat)... So lets talk about the situation
Okay so maybe this is just me, but why did your group keep climbing up *after a near death experience?* Are you guys the friend group that stays in the haunted cabin even after you find signs of a seral killer?
egg
look Maaz, you are on a mountain
He really hit us with the "the real gift was the friends we made along the way"
This video made my day
10:50 is the cherry magnet a reference to cherry?
That's why I always bring chocolate 🍫
5:09 wait, is that supposed to be a specific YouTuber, or is it just a general joke in how you tubers do dumb stuff and gets themselves killed.
Dude, I think this is the best work you've ever done or at least one of the best. So wholesome! Liked it a lot, man.
I went to mount Tongariro for a school camp once! The mountains are absolutely beautiful! Though I wouldn’t want to climb that thing so yikes.
I legit teared up at the end.
the little montage at the end is so cute these experiences are what makes life worth it
Maaz be respawning like he’s in Jumanji
Hey uhh, Maz you aren't in any of these pictures except the first one, you sure they're your friends? 10:38
hey, Maaz, thx 4 making me cry today :'D
so, now i know what happened to smitty werbenjagermanjensen, he died being n1!
Can we just talk about how beautiful and sweet the ending is.. 💕😭 and also his calm and soothing voice at the end almost sends me to tears.. MAAZ STAWP MAKING ME CRY-
You never disappointed me when it comes to entertainment. Love ya, my dude
This felt as if i just read a book
Hi
This sounds like a final message
:000
this video feels a lot more personal. Like it was made for you rather than us.
I wasn't expecting such a heartfelt moment there at the end, made me feel fuzzy inside.
Go NZ! But seriously, well done Maaz, my Mum did the hike a couple of years ago and even her experience was very painful but worth it. I still enjoy looking at her celebrity photos 😊
I'm a pealed coconut I guess
E
This made me really tear up. Dammit, I miss my friends so much; I'm already saving up to fly to them so we can hang out after so long.
rip knees :(
rip in piece Maaz's knees 😩 you will be missed 🙏
Now that's a good montage
You ok
Among us thumbnail
Odd1sout and u uploaded
The moral is literally "the real journey was the friends we made along the way", but it works! I'm so happy for you all, Maaz!
Finally you post a vid like other times
Maz keeps getting saved from falling over the edge: his dad, his best bud, there may be more he hasn't told hahaha
Try climbing Mount Washington in winter 😏👍
I'm late but I'm here
BUT THE ENDING THOUGH-         my heart melted 🥰❤️
Odd1sout upload and then Maaz uploading. Perfect timing to watch on my break🥰 Ps: my shift is torture so this is the only highlight so far.
356th comment
hi
I live in nz
After stepping on my foot the wrong way and having to deal with a broken ankle and the anxiety of school this video was a nice breath of fresh air. Thank you Mazz for being willing enough to share your stories and giving people like me a place to turn when life is not the best.
your name is soo HARD too pronounced just look mars m
LET'S GO! WHOLESOME VIDEO CONTENT YEEES!
*INTENSE SLURPING*
🤌🤌🤌
Do you still have your knees?
So, basically, the REAL dangerous 8 hour mountain hike was the friends we made along the way
This story is bringing back so many memories of when I hike up the tongariro crossing with my scout group and I can relate to everything you said in this, the legs felling like jelly reaching the top only  to have to take another 5 hours going back down and running completely out of water.
He's on a mountain hehe
Nah the end made me cry
8:39 one of those frames look a bit sus
Yay! Another amaazing video Maaz!!
Bruh, why do you all animators post videos the same day!?
Awesome video 👍🏽
Im studying New Zeland the year
And  if  my friends from  greenville see this  I  love and you
awesome
When I was like 12 years old I was in a summer camp located in the mountains. And one day they asked us who wants to go on a 6 hours hike? And I was like me me of course I want it cant be that hard right?   It was a 12 hours hike we returned wet from a powerfull rain and soo tired. My legs didnt function anymore for a whole day xD
What if the 8 hour hike only ment 8 hours up.
Great job
You missed out on an entire sonic green hill zone joke with the Tomas the tank engine joke.Btw I love your vids and I hope you see your friends again
Omg another maaz video finally🥳🥳🥳🥳
You just got rickrolled
*Me about to climb this mountain after Maaz explicitly told me not to.*
As a kiwi, this video makes me so happy, because half the time people dont even know we exist
Love you videos
I remember trying to drive to a mountain as a kid and I had a dream I died while climbing. And I even made sure to not climb fast and whaddya know, I almost died climbing it. And I only survived thanks to me crawling instead of climbing normally because I didn't wanna take any chances.
ok
I wanted mafia price 3
Don't mind me looking at the comments to see if one his friends commented
Did every animator upload today or what
Kay is just the Brock (Pokemon character) of real life.
Mazz is either gay mayosexual or has a butt fetish
I understand the feeling. I miss a lot of my old colleague buddies. We had such fun together >3
huh, i don't remember this part of celeste
maafia part 3 teaser?
I live in NZ and this is a relatable video I climbed a mount just recently  too also nice ending.
Did maz just clip through the backrooms? 2:21
8:39
That llama at the start is just a Minecraft goat in disguise.
Amazing
Less painful than my life
That thumbnail was an AMaangus reference...
asmr ad?
the videos at the end was so cute i can’t
its funny when you compare the atlete to the people that never had done that before and how crazy you represent it
We ain't gonna speak about the human fall flat reference or.. Is it not actually an intentional reference.
WHY AM I CRYING OVER A GROUP OF PEOPLE I ONLY KNOW FROM TWO YOUTUBE VIDEOS AUGHHHHHHHH
That ending montage was so wholesome. Thank you for the great message!
The sheep will kill you if you arent a sheep
When I did the this hike I took so long our van had left already.
One of my favourite memories was going on a (albeit not very steep) eight hour mountain hike when I was eight. My family got chocolate lava cake at a chilli’s afterwards :)
I love you
Me enjoying A new mazz video.    me internally crying because I don’t have friends to do This with
This reached me dead in the heart
pisstafer
84 minutes ago
very good animation ngl
Go post on Newgrounds
11:58 What is that on the airplane wing? It looks like a spider
LoL 5:47
I went on an overnight hike when I was 11 for a school trip. We went to the pinnacles which was a 4-hour hike continuous upward for the first day and then a 2-hour hike up above the clouds at 5am. Did I mention that half of the hike to the top of the pinnacles on the second day was handles bolted into rocks 😑😑 (but it really was an amazing sight to see the sun rise over the clouds . I would reccomend if you come back to NZ:))(We also ruined someones proposal though😅)
Maaz is quite correct about the sheep.
I know someone's going to ran over with the train
Chicken 🐔
Wow this was touching but the ending made me feel so sad like if  Mazz was disappointed or devastated
2:54 he just had to say it
YOU HAVE MOCED THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE!
Don't worry Mauz, I feel You, I AM a 21 year old lady with knees that make a really painful sound anytime I do the smallest squat...
I WILL climb that DANGEROUS mountain.
These vids are great!
Maazz: i hope your all doing well  Me has covid il try
JEJE MAAZ, I KNOW UR TRICKS, THESE ARE PROBS NOT UR JOKES AND ITS JAMES
Who knew a mountain story could be so interesting?
Drac, why are you grabbing my cheeks?
Mashallah!...dude u make me feel more proud to be a muslim thank u soo much!
The recent thumbnail art and animation are just masterpieces
Why is every popular content creator posting today???!!!
I live in nz there. are not many sheep and also most of New Zealand is very ugly but there are a few good places
⛰⛰⛰
SOUP IS IRELAND
I feel like hiking now
You made it home alive? Bunch of below KNEE :p
She can *sïp*
Facing adversity with your best buds is probably the best feeling in the entire world <3
What’s the song nearing the end
5:07 to 5:16 Glad u didn't actually fall down....
i luv your vids! keep going at it
first Oddonesout now him this is an amaazing day
mafia part 3 ;)
This video actually got me crying because of the montage around the end just reminded me of old friends, thanks for the great video
Bravo, Bravo!, this was a very sweet and wholesome video, the ending just remember my friends that I met in Elementary in school. Thanks Maaz
Can agree New Zealand is beautiful
5:51
Huh, I don't remember this episode of Thomas the tank Engine
Hi
Hi
In 2020 my cousin and husband did the crossing, during the trek someone had to get helicoptered out cuz they collapsed.
8:41 <—- click now
Wow he wasn't joking when he said he was going go make a video about somewhere in new Zealand 😶
is this the same mountain when you ripped your pants(im not even sure that was you or im confusing you with a different animator)  edit: oh nvm you talk about that later lol
There were several times during this video that I went up to the like button only to realize that I already clicked it.
Today is a good day because both him and theodd1sout posted a video
Hoya
Oh man. Yeah that hike is super exhausting but honestly like nothing I've seen before. I did the walk with two ingrown and infected toenails, but worth it.  On the walk down when we got to the bit of bush walk I heard my first Long Tailed Cuckoo, which a very ellusive NZ bird. Still yet to actually see one though.  Loved the montage at the end showing off some of the beautiful landscapes and scenery. I also saw you got some footage of Black-billed Gulls. They're actually the most threatened species of Gull in the world. Super special to me
you got me emotional at the end even though I dont have any friends :')
I thought you were dead because you did not post any videos
maybe the true reason for this hike was the friends he made along the way😔
Well done Maaz.
3:05 I was kind of expecting s lightning bolt to strike him into ash
Is Maaz a real doctor?
This entire video I'm thinking of the Ripped Pants video 4:34 Ah, that's why
The funny thing is I live around this area, though I'm over in turangi
Can we all take a moment to appreciate the absolute AMaazing animating in this video? Legendary! :D
Im from New zealand So Im Happy That people Dont Think It Does Not Exist :)
0:32 W H I T E
When James, Maaz, and Adam upload on the same day: YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Your friend Kaye look like Brock from Pokémon
The ending was so good
Oof I missed it
I love the soundtrack
yoooooooooooooo
gae.
Good
Well newzwland dose not have postal 2
Good job maaz you made it up the mountain and made lots of memories too
Dang, wasn't expecting a wholesome video but here we are!
*Lord of the Rings intensifies*
The real mountain view was the friends we made along the way
Literally the entire video: Maaz: Why are we still here... just to suffer... Jafina: *athletic noises*
This video is for all the people who hate hiking on mountains 🤣🤣🤣🤣
This video truly inspires me to keep going and live my life for the journey not the destination I love u Maaz
?
Its sooo awesome you talk about New Zealand. Born and breed here, I'm grateful what NZ is and shows. But hearing it from other people from different countries, it brings more pride and grateful that I was born here.  But next time Maaz, please like idk make an announcement if you do come over here again 😅 really want to say hi in person. Being an Invercargill citizen (the southest town in NZ) we miss seeing people from across the world, as they normally go to Auckland, Wellington or Queenstown. But I'm glad ya enjoyed ya trip 😊 hope you and ya fam are doing alright across the ditch.
Maaz: okay why did u climb a mountain   Me: well tbh sir...I did it because it was a tradition..
The animation is honestly so smooth in this video omg
All that blood and sweat for a sheep lol 😂
Your videos are every entertaining. And very funny
Yo, anyone know the song he plays near the end? It’s so good and I want to listen to it more!
Sheesh, those sheep need a haircut….did they go to the….    Wait for it…..      *Baa-Baa Shop*?     I’m sorry :(
10:45
I won't
I was almost expecting this to be about the video game celeste.
ThoMaaz The Taank Engine
-e same video.
This is th-
162nd!!
So you climb Mt Tongariro which is about 20 km away from Mt Ruapehu,which is a active volcano.         Video sponsored by tourism New Zealand.
this is acually really good, idk what to say now beside that
it wont rain for MONTHS then when you want to do something theres enough rain that my paddocks flood
sheep are the worst-  (also the stream was amazing :D)
Les go new video
knew an ad was coming
the scenery is so gorgeous, it's totally worth almost dying TwT
hi
I love the ending it makes me so happy to see maaz and his mates just being themselves
This is great
The real goal was friendship <3 or some corny bs
XD
I feel your pain, Maaz
I lost my mod powers over this video lmao
I love the fact that the mountain is infinite, you never actually fall off
That ending montage with him and his friends was so cute and sweet💞
That was a wholesome ending
Where are we? *we’re on a mountain*
This was a truly brilliant video of yours, Maaz. I have also went on a hike half the time of this, 4 hours, so, to see someone go even further, double that.. I’m blown away. Your friends & you yourself seems just A”Maaz”ing. <3
This is a video to remember :)
THIS VIDEO IS AWESOME MAAZ
Bro how he not get trauma when almost falling off
Did any of your friends review that script before u made this? (TheOdd1Sout video reference) Edit: Oh... I just watched it fully this was made in poor taste.
wAIT ARE YOU ALL STILL IN CONTACT???
That was an aMaazing hike!
Maaz ur a great guy I hope ur good
Make mafia 3 please
Dang! This video was amazing!
oh the end was gorgeous :D. i hope your friends are doing well too :D
That ending was pretty great man
What a wholesome ending :)
Nice
The ending is just so beautifulll
This was AMAAZING! Okay bye
:3
My chooses today watch Maaz's video or watch Technoblade's well strategized live stream of building. I have chosen to miss at least 20 minutes of Technoblade's stream       You're only a real one if you sacrifice a Technoblade stream for a Maaz premier
What the fuuuuuuuuuu
this is so good
PLEASE THE ENDING WAS SO WHOLESOME ❤
This story was amazing, the ending hit me hard as well good work Maaz
This was the best
The ending was deep.
Thank you 😊
I know your suffering. Every summer my parents make me and my brother climb mountains with them, and Its just…terrible. We do get free candy on the tours tho
Are you a banana or a coconut?
😀

Everything is okay if Maaz doesn't climb the Everest, I heard that there are about 200 corpses used as guide marks for the climbists.

The sheep: first we conquer this land, and then…..the world

Awesome animation! It looks AMAAZING But seriously, that last part almost made me cry because it reminds me of my friend group. We don't have much time left together before high school ends and we are all scared to grow apart. But, it is about cherishing your time left. I will be good to my friends, thanks Maaz <3
This music kinda nice tho
