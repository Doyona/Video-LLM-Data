Kirk is so weird.
No wonder Gary Moore always sounds so badass.
That guitar should be called  Gary Moore guitar!!!!
That guitar is legendary Jesus and hey Kirk buddy you're on that list too now!!!! Incredible....
I always hope that great guitars end up in safe hands and luckily that's always been the case with Greeny.
What a killer story! Thanks Kirk!
I heard Kirk paid about 450 grand for that guitar. Probably a pretty good price considering how legendary that it is. Gary Moore's version of "Shapes of Things" is amazing.
Sacrilege him owning that guitar.
💪💛👊
its just a les paul with humbucker pick ups, not unique in any way!!
My guitar sounds better.
With all respect to Peter Green, the forming of Fleetwood Mac was just as much Mick Fleetwood as it was Peter. Though they both wanted John in the band, they had to wait a few months for some contractual comitment stuff to run out to get McVie.  Nice too see Peter recognized though.
Not worthy of that guitar
It's only a guitar,get over it.🥰.
Gary Moore!!
Did he ever come out of the closet?
Can someone figure out how to make the tone used?
Dave Mustaine is a better lead guitarist
❤🎼✨✨✨✨💥❤
Kirk is so wholesome omgggggg
For me it is a crminal offense to scratch Initials next to the pickup selector cover on the backside of this  this guitar.
I think I even played Greeny one time 🤔
Pity it didn't go to a guitar player😅
To me it’ll always be Gary Moore’s guitar.
Just saw Kirk play Orion tonight on Greeny in the M72 Tour!
I prefer to say Ulrich with a “rich” sound not a “rick” sound
The minute Kirk started strumming I immediately heard Thin Lizzy
You know a guitar is special when it has it's own fan club.
Mustaine smashed kerry king's guitar it would have been kirk's greeny😂
Just too Cool 😎👍💯
Always happy to hear the name, ‘Rory Gallagher.’ One of the all time great guitarists.
lars urlich devaluation afforded kirk the guitar
Just switch hot and ground
i love lars
Kirk is a fantastic musician. Great personality 🎉
Pete Green Albatross .. WOW..!!  I had just arrived in Australia from the UK after five weeks on a Boat via the Panama Canal ... when I heard Albatross on the radio I said to a mate wow ,, I can just imagine being on a sail boat just cruising the Ocean..
Awesome to hear Kirk’s reverence for Peter and Gary .   They would both be proud to know that guitar is still gigged instead of sitting in a collection .  Bravo to Kirk .
Is he transitioning into a Latina woman?
Howard Stern doesn't play guitar, he plays the Skin Flute 😉
I want this
So basically Greeny is the most passed around woman.
I knew this story, but not the Hendrix and others
Larz lol
TIENE DINERO Y MUCHO PARA COMPRARLA PERO LE FALTA TALENTO!!!
Mike Greenberg?
All that's left is for Joe Bonamassa to buy the number one strat from Steve Ray Vaughan e la comedia  e finita
, ува ж аю Метал и ку
Greeny is worth $5 million dollars now.
Hammett is such a twirky little weirdo, but I love Les Pauls.
Top of the heap, check out the flame on this one, it's known for its sustain 😂
That sustain tho
Kirk:  Its amazing when get to a point in life where you find that one thing that completes you. Kirk's wife:  Honey that's so sweet. Kirk:  Baby can you bring me "Greeny"?
That must make Jimmy Page's 58 les Paul  named "number one" about 5 million
Greeny is this timelines pick of destiny
Damn, Hendrix and Harrison😮
Greeny would be worth 6 to times as much possibly today
That guitar needs to be in the hands of an actual accomplished guitarist.
Plot Twist: Rob played it before Peter Green did
Damn…. Greeny actually does sound bloody magnificent
Greeny is a guitar that demands to be played
aww hetfield got first refusal and kinda shit all over kirks passionate story from there on out  lol
Now the riffs and notes of three outstanding guitarists are burned into this instrument‘s body.
Greeny gets around
Kirk’s Guitars so so good 😊
Lars laughing at james banter 😂😂😂
I can hear evry none guitar person say i don't gear anything different.  Guitar junkies are nuts
If this Gibson LesPaul is played by Hendrix, George Harrison, Jeff Beck, Rory Galagher, Gary Moore and now Kirk, it will be worth $2,000,000 sooner or later.🔥 because the DNA of those players are embedded somewhere on the guitar, the tiny sweat and dead skin gunk are still there even if you clean it.
W O W  ! ! ! ! !
And now it's in Fortnite.
Ningúem  ya si pra que tu fala
James has great sense of humor as always :)
Kirk saying he won’t spend $2 million on just about anything is hilarious considering he lives in a house that costs 7x that much😂😂I know it’s an investment, but still
wow
"It's famous for its sustain ' "Nigel Tufnel"
Gary moore played it the most. He created some beautiful pieces with it.
I can't believe we have a legendary guitar on Fortnite now, it just feels so unreal.
Peter Green is probably the best British blues guitarist back then - absolute legend
What about the bridge pickup? Wtf...
KIRK ,is to me one of the coolest and humble people on the planet. I get pissed because I feel he is highly, highly underrated.  He is already a legend, just time will tell.❤❤❤❤❤
That is an amazing sounding guitar. I can't explain it
I missed the part where he say how much he paid. Someone know?
I didn't realise Kirk could pay guitar...
the genius in the band.
Hendrix played it, Jeff Beck,  Lars Urlich, that was funny.
they're all controlled by a vast corporate media culture complex
I think it's funny that he ONLY bought the guitar. Why not get Peter's AMP, too? It's on YouTube in some other musicians collection.
Kirk hammet is fab
When l listen to Metallica, lol so do my neighbors!!
Gary Moore is one of the all time legends. Needs more recognition. He’s your favorite guitarist’s favorite guitarist.
I guess that awesome sustain sure helps when playing "The Supernatural".
All this from an adult male wearing nail varnish 😅..🤮
He couldn't hold Garry Moore's jock.
❤
❤😊😅
I am not a musician.  I think it is interesting that musicians have such discerning ears that they can tell a huge difference between the sound when he has the toggle in 2 different positions.  I get only a slight difference in sound to my untrained ear.
If only Metallica played music that I liked, because they sound cool in the interview.
Kirk was ready for that question
Was he back stage at a crossroads?
I want THAT guitar
I can't believe he carved his initials in it, but it is his guitar now.
Gary more incredible guitarist
So it's official. Greeny is the fifth member of the band and Kirk's BFF.
"LARS ULRICH" 😂😂😂
There is something about a member of Metallica buying iconic pieces of music history. Kirk Hammett buying Peter Green’s Les Paul and Robert Trujillo buying Jaco Pastorius’s Bass of Doom.
It's very cool that this guitar has survived and continues to be played. What a history!
Legend has it that “Greenie” has made more false notes since it belonged to its new owner than in more than fifty years of existence. RIP Gary and Peter
BECAUSE THE GUITAR IS POSSESSIVE IS WHY HE PLAYS IT SO WELL.
Just flip your humbucker, or wire them out of phase. There's nothing unique sounding in that thing. At the time it was slightly unusual, but apart from it's excellent history the guitar is totally unremarkable.
Greeny is “The Elder Les Paul”  Harry Potter fans know what i mean
Spinal Tap vibes
That guitar has its own soul.
well...at least Kirk does play the guitar.....but he's no Gary Moore.....haa......cheers.
#LoveGreenie🎉😂
The sale of the guitar was brokered by vintage guitar dealer Richard Henry.
He should feel honoured that Gary Moore played it.
Kirk needs to come out of the closet
Kirk is very respectful regarding this guitar and also Peter which means a lot to all Peter Green fans. The instrument is in good sensible hands.
wish i understood the technical stuff he talks about re the guitar. wonder if howard understood ha ha or just didn't pin him down on it
Reminder Kirk Hammett wrote 0% songs in Metallica
2 million no thank you
Happy Birthday Kirkland 🎂
Howard is always about as gentle as a wrecking ball.
god damn the ones that played that guitar already, really a relic on rock n' roll music history, and it continues whit its life now, on metal, thanks to Kirk
This guitar should really be owned by a bluesman. I.M.O.
Oh, kirk, you, definitely paid 2 mil for that guitar and ya know what? That's ok because it makes you happy.  If i had metallica money i would of probably done the same.  That guitar is extremely special!  🤙🤘
1:34 Its funny that they are laughing at Kirk for paying so much for a guitar.
Yes but did the Great Steve Vai play that guitar.
Dewey finn sold it to him
i was expecting Kirk to mention Gary Moore, as well. kinda disappointed
If i have that guitar probably ill talk about it all the time too.
Gary Moore played Still Got The Blues on this guitar
Don't care what anyone says, Howard Stern has the best interviews and I will keep coming back to hear them.
Look up Gary Moore, people.
Kirk is such a guitar geek. Love how dorky James and Lars are acting😂
I will give you $20.00 for that ol thing...always wanted a les paul...
Kirk got it for 1.5 mil.
I know where my favorite guitar is 24/7 and it sleeps in my room with me
So basically Kirk Hammett owns one of the greatest guitars of all time.
I love Kirk. And yes, guitars are meant to be played. Rock n roll!
He knows The Legend Rory Gallagher
Gary Moore was the most expressive emotional guitarist ever and his guitar ends up in the hands of the complete opposite should be a criminal offence
"That's how It got do expensive, Lars played It" 😂
How much did he pay ?
It has really great sustain……
So true 🎉🎉🎉
Pay him what he wants.....hmmmmm  their is a price .  How about 10 million 😊
With his amp tone, you really can't hear the "Greeny" sound.
Kirk should meet up with Jimmy Page, Slash, Joe Perry and other awesome guitarists still around and let them play it as well
....and now in the hands of the most iconic lead metal guitarist and riff masters of our time.
coffee shop diction when he was in exudes
Greeny is the best
Most of the time Kirk is a silent type in the band but ask him about guitars, movie monsters memorabilia etc . he open up immediately.
Talks about how great the guitar sounds, proceeds to play the most overdriven signal I’ve ever heard.
What’s Kirk doing playing blues riffs anyways lol
I bought the ]v[EGADET]-[ guitar
kirk phukin loves dat g-tar yo
Has Infinite Sustain... (sustain drops out immediately)
Kirk Hammett's "Greeny" vs. Willie Nelson's "Trigger".... and go.
Only thing I hear from that guitar is Gary Moore, that's his tone
No wonder that James refused this guitar, he needs Downstroke-speedster-guitars not melodic icons.
fleetwood mac mega
Syrupy?? Was that him having a sly dig at Lars hairline?
The Green Manalishi (with the two pronged crown). It was the last song Green made with Fleetwood Mac before leaving the band.
Kirk has no clue. The guitar belongs in a museum or gary's cemetery, rather than in his hands.
Went straight to Seymour Duncan himself for an electronics inspection. he may not have dropped 2 mil but it was close I guarantee
Now Kirk all it needs is an 81/60 combo(kidding dummies)
That Guitar has its own wikipedia page
Anyone got a clip on YouTube of Kirk playing it on stage somewhere?
James is furious that someone else is speaking
If that guitar could talk, imagine the stories it would tell 🤔
Bravo it's being played!!..it's not meant to be a museum piece
Just an ordinary chat between millionaires...
It’s truly disgusting that he has that guitar.
I herar Stevie Ray Vaughan vibe from what Kirk was playing
wooo all those names he mentionned are legends and they played the same guitar?? are you kidding me. that's insane. Lucky him omg.
I love how he danced around paying 2 mil for that thing.
I'm so pleased Kirk has this great sounding guitar and will add even more history to it.
How much Kirk paid for it
0:33 bombastic side eye of Kirk in response to James' little laugh
Cool story
Still don't know how much he paid for it..🤟🎸
Hendrix and Beck played it, too? Awesome.
Well, if it wasn't two million, how much was it?
So there’s an actual “guitar of destiny” that exists too!😂🎸🤘🏽
So how much did he pay? 🤔
Mine's called grinny
This guitar is a legend on it's own, so cool to see it's still being played by another legendary guitar player
You have to love Kirk. He loves his instrument. Hes a true master.
Yea but Hendrix played lefty?
I am so happy a proper guitarist owns Greeny. Its a legend on its own. Peter and Gary made it a icon . I hope Kirk looks  after it
Whiskey in the jar was written on this guitar
Kirk has become a lovely middle-aged woman
I would give 2 mill for the gary moore les Paul, Parisian walkways, pretty women, midnight blues solos are awesome
なんか笑ってしまった
Lars made it even more expensive 😂
Er...greeny is not a good word in england
Let Lindsey play it.
Kirk saved the best till last...rory Gallagher
Damn, just discussing Greenie makes Kirk emotional.
Ok, so it’s safe to say, Kirk paid NEAR $2,000,000 for Greeny.
Now that people know, Lars Ulrich played this guitar, it's worthless
Wonder what he paid ?
Very cool but how much Kirk
Rory Gallagher played that guitar as well? Wow
2:11 Jesus Christ that's a hell of a tone...
Howard: "Do you play it on stage?"  Kirk: "Yes." Howard, not even a minute later.:"James, have you ever heard him play this guitar before?"
it does have its own timbre, but idont think the guitar's timbre matters much,i think it's the music that is the most important; however Kirk Hammett  is at such a highest level, that he already appreciates those ultimate details with passion
I wonder what Kirk would want more... Greeny or a fang from the real Dracula lol.
It's called greeny cause it's yellow
today he presented Ross Halfin with Greeny
Kirk is so passionate about that guitar.
lmao his voice hasn't changed
Chinese knockoff 😂🤣
Safe to say he paid millions. “I’ll give you what you want” 😂😂
My god, what a story that guitar has. Gary Moore, always a fave of mine
Kirk quickly skipped the ' what did the guitar cost' part!! ;-)😆
Kirk’s beauty shines through in his passion. I can’t think of a better person to carry that green torch
You’d pay millions for a race car driven by Nicky Lauda & Ayerton  Senna. A no brainer generational purchase.
Add Kirk to the list 🫡
Very nice friend
Anybody else wish they had Kirk’s passion for something in their life
So cool! And what a sound.
Kirk plays much cleaner and accurate to the songs whenever he plays the Gibsons
Too much $$$ in your pocket.... gotta buy something ?!!  😢
The KH-Ouija is my one.
Wow, with all that pedigree, that's the most badass guitar in the world!
Cant tell a sounds difference 🤣
Route it for a Floyd
Rest in peace Peter Green !
Mas put...
so how much does Kirk paid for Greeny?
"Tone Chasing"
Lars didn't play it, he twanged it... xp
So…Hendrix played it?? Upside down, or…?
Saint Joseph terror of demons pray for us..
So question—what did he end up paying for it?
Robert Trujillo has Jaco Pastorius' bass. That's probably even cooler!
My best friend and I chased kirk Hammett through the parking lot at monsters of rock in late 80s !!!!!
I played it when it was at Terry house.. the mojo is what its ALL about!
Love how Greeny is played still by a true guitarist!
Only Greeny and the Kossoff Burst for me. Impossible to choose between those. Both sound insane. Both "badly repaired" by Sam Li.
0:44 love this lol
he should talk about his lost phone of riffs
Wow! A bit fanatical and crazy but fulfilling a dream and standing by it. Kirk I get it and I'm sure many out there feel the same.😎
That's incredible
Looking at Greeny's pickups, the neck pickup is installed upside down. (you can tell from the orientation of the pole pieces) That would explain why it is out of phase with the bridge pickup.
Fingernail polish.  🙄 Loss of respect.
I bet Psychedelic Bee would sound great on that.
WOW! The magic inside that guitar. I can't even imagine holding it much less playing it. Fucking cool. Thanks Howard
There's a lot of soul in that guitar.
It's a tragedy that this legendary guitar ended up in Kirks hands...
He didn't say it, but he actually paid nearly $1M for that guitar. Obviously it's just peanuts for him, but still...
Cool story. Shit... if Hendrix played air guitar on a broomstick I'd want it too!
Brilliant 👏 What a Great Guitar sound 👌 😀 👍
This band has given so much of themselves.  If Kirk wanted to be buried with Greeny, I'd understand.
That is one magic guitar!
How much is that greeny guitar??
That's the most I've ever heard Kirk talk
Attempt 43 at getting Metallica to come to south Africa in Cape town please let me be heard by Metallica
the guitar sounds crazy...what?!  even without playing it and jsut hearing it....I totaly understand what Kirk is talking about
Where is the full interview?
Good to see it in such good hands and that it is well loved. I get a little 🥲 seeing that guitar. So much musical history. Peter Green created and performed some of the greatest music ever with that instrument. Incomparable.
It's really awesome how Kirk gets enthusiastic and talkative when asked about his favourite instrument. Greeny is special alright.
Peter Green didn’t think much of this guitar when comparing it to Eric’s Beano - which he had the opportunity to play back in 1965. He described Eric’s as a thing of beauty and his as having a split tree trunk for a neck.
legend
The insurance on greeny must be eye watering
Avec les lunettes de soleil c'est le colonel Kadhafi ?
Kirk is just a treasure.
"It has a great sustain" *sustain drops immediately* -_-
So he bought a used guitar 😁
Stream the FULL interview: siriusxm.com/Metallica-HS
Una chitarra leggendaria ..... Non sono sicuro sia nelle mani giuste .....!!
Gibson will be releasing some limited edition Custom Shop copies and a Standard version is rumored to be coming later, very cool guitar!
Kirk went into a LOT more detail about acquiring Greeny on Dean Delrays podcast, Let There Be Talk. For anyone interested.
Kirk's Nigel Tufnel moment 🤟
😂Lars played it. 😂
Cool story bro 😎
I love how they all tease Lars.  So funny
I'm just surprised that Lars and James are letting Kirk speak. I seriously kept expecting him to be interrupted!
Most coherent Kirks ever been. Love it
This guitar is real legend.
It's great Kirk plays it on stage. I mean it's been played Gary Moore for 30 years, among others. It's meant to be out there getting used.
Undoubtedly the most legendary Les Paul in existence. RIP Peter Green, the real GOAT
GREAT PASSION AND RESPECT WENT HE TALKS ABOUT GREENY....I LOVE  THAT IN A MUSICIAN MAKES HIM AUTHENTIC-
*GREENY IS  SYRUPY  AND IT  SUSTAINS*
LOL, love it.
Robert must feel left out.
Kirk is my favorite member of this band…..and I love them ALLLL!!
LOLOL that sustain.. you mean the note that died out almost immediately?
James is not making fun of Lars…but of Kirk. Look at his body language. The way he looks at Kirk. Guess what he is thinking.
First time I've heard him speak and play the guitar without wah wH
Même si c'est kirk qui a la gratte,  je suis content que greeny soit entre les mains d'un musicien.  Et non pas derrière une vitrine.
That Lizzy photo isn't Gary Moore or that guitar at all!
Yep Kirk, now learn to play guitar!
It belongs in a museum!
Says its got great sustain and it dies out within a second lol.
Was low key disappointed the guitar wasn't... well green.😢
Now I understand why I cried in the Unforgiven solo last year when they played in Buenos Aires: Kirk was using the greeny. I love Kirk
I am pro-vajazzle as many people know
Love early Fleetwood Mac  Thanks for the jams Peter
the "greeny" sounds beyound awesome
wow that's a real nice guitar
Kirk is a real influence on me, I dig his playing. This is a good home for Greenie.
well Kirk.. you just made "Greeny" a 10M dollar guitar just by telling us how beautiful history it has... great!!
Poor Greenie ...Have been on the hands of Gary Moore, now that :(
And yet he can’t add melody to his new solos 😢
Shout out to Black Rose by Thin Lizzy!
Kirk rules! 🤘
Come on Howei it's a fookin 1959 LES PAUL STANDARD!!!
And the neck pickup is pointed in the wrong direction????
A lot of history on that Guitar...  Just wow
Buy a LP,  turn the neck pickup around. Same thing.
Peter Green’s Guitar…
Can you imagine if Kirk buying a legendary axe that expensive  and being in a legendary band could actually play? LMAO
Am I crazy? I could have sworn that I read somewhere that he gave Greeny back to whoever owned it before.
So how much did he actually pay for it??
You can tell Kirk has knocked one out to this guitar bless him
Now Metallica should play a cover of Judas Priest playing a cover of Fleetwood Mac.
Thank you for this.
The fact that the guitar actually gets played and we were able to hear it... vs it just being behind glass somewhere in a museum with a little placard with info is already a massive level of justice. This also makes me realize we rarely hear from Kirk. He should speak up more often.
Peter green is the Greatest blues guitarist of all time.
Good that it's not just sitting in a museum, but for me that guitar will always be Gary's Guitar, I have spoken!
Did his boyfriend buy it for him?
Вы крутые дядьки)
Oh the sustain. You go out for a bite of a sandwich and come back and the sustain will still be there. Just listen .
how much?????
2:17 listen to that sustain. You could go and have a bite, and you'd still be hearing that one  ahhhh
You can get the exact same sound including ever better sustainment if that's even a word. EMG model 82 Kirk. That is the one up on greeny my friend
How good is Kirk, it’s the most I’ve heard him speak, legend!
I think Kirk made a good case for it. It cracked me up when James said Lars Ulrich on who's played it.
Oh well is one of my favourite og fleetwood Mac songs
I love this band.♥️
It's probably the most iconic 59 Les Paul in the world...but I would have to put Pearly Gate's up there with Greeny...🎸🎸🎸
Kirk is super cool!  He is himself to the fullest!
I read that BB King said Peter Greene had the best tone he ever heard. Curious if that was this guitar
He's a blues rocker at heart
🤘🤘🤘
Be cool if howard played it. but it might break lol
This is the Replica they made a handful of for 50,000 which is moded to every scratch and crack dirt it has...This came with a dinner with Kirk Hammet and everything   They just put out another version not as specific with all the dirt and chipping but it's at 20,000  https://youtu.be/M0nbUdJgG4k
Cool story
I could have listened to this story for hours.. We need a doco done on this guitar...
Kirk is God.
Thin Lizzy! yeh!
I’v seem this git on kirk’s many times and always thought it doesn’t fit the met’s look
Greeny does sound great.
easy to hear what inspired Gary all those years .. wow
Gary Moore...RIP
That is not a picture of Gary Moore.
What a dork Kirk is. Love it. Legends.
They forgot Jimmy Page too!
I thought he bought it from the gary moore auction
A beacon, he is.
That guitar looked same with Slash guitar
GARY MOORE=THEE GUITAR GOD 🤘🏼
How much did he pay??
James’ resting position is a power stance.
now I know what to kidnap for ransom from Kirk! hahahahahah GREENY!!!!
Can you imagine how much the insurance on that would cost 😂
I saw this guitar...at Sam Lee's in Soho in the 70s.
So what did he pay for it?
Wow, that must be one of the most mo-jo'ed guitars ever, and in Kirk, it found its perfect owner!
But how much did he pay?
All this BS Electric is Electric if it’s in tune, and Hendrix played it, it would sound great. What a crutch.
u can just add a push pull pot for phase switching or reverse the pickup. But given the history of the guitar, it’s a keeper 🎸
James Hetfield didn't want the guitar 😂  It's a history LesPaul ❤
The Red Violin ..but of rock n role.
Kirk is awesome
What an incredible history as to the list of artists that have played that guitar!!
🤯 I hope he has security following that guitar around. 🎸
Fantastic🎸
That neck pickup is beautiful.
So Kirk DOES have good vibrato in there somewhere. Interesting.
The History of that Guitar is incredible 🎸
Dudes got woman's hands.
So... how much was it?
The guitar that recorded "Albatross", the most heavenly rock instrumental ever put to record.
At the very least 'Greeny" is played and appreciated instead of being in some art collectors showcase.
James...I turned it down lmao
Sponsored content. Next bring in Kirk's Gibson Flying V
Kirk looks young
I wouldn't pay 2 million for anything. I paid 1.9 million😅
Kirk put a little hole in the back of that guitar
Cette guitare a une sacrée histoire
It's a blessing that Greeny is in Kirk's hands and not in some collector's vault. Kirk's love for Greeny makes it the best owner possible, enjoy it, you deserve it!!!!
B.S
Not surprised. Once owned and played by the great Peter Green.
Kirk is the shiz.
So…how much did he pay?!
Kirk beautiful
the obsession with and pursuit of tone is such an interesting phenomena.. if you want to hold and play Greeny it'll set you back a million dollars.. otherwise you could create the Greeny sound and texture, identical to the human ear, for less than a thousand bucks if you understand pickups and switch wiring. but the reference instrument itself becomes an unobtainable Holy Grail
Nothing against Kirk, but I wish the guitar had gone to Joe Bonamassa. Gary Moore was without question the greatest guitarist that ever walked this earth and Joe would be a very worthy owner. 😊😎🎸🇬🇧🇺🇦
Just the fact that gary moore played on it make it a great guitar in my eyes https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcAgmoGeMB4
3:16 "Lars Ulrich" 😂😂😂
Kirk is such a guitar geek!
Kirk bought the famous hooker
spoiler , he bought it because he is richj
"Lars Ulrich"
Cool of him name-checking Gary Moore and Rory Gallagher 🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪
you can notice he realises noone in the room understands the 59 les paul thing and hes being very defencive , we know what you mean kirk , let them talk !
Only Gary Moore can make that guitar sing .
And James used his flying v
I think we can all agree that this is the most we all have ever heard Kirk talk....EVER!!!
Usually, with guitars, you need to play it yourself to understand why it's a great guitar, but with this one you can hear that tone and just get it.
The way James hyped Lars up 😂
I’m not paying two million for anything  You’re not getting this back Ok make it six #grangergloryhole
Hey; I even played it Once ! (lol)
Should have stayed in the blues circles
Kirk can talk?
Well how much was it
Did Peter Green mod it?
Kirk..favorite guitar player of all time
Sustain😁
the last time I heard kirk hammet's voice was 20 years ago on their behind the music episode, and I thought, wow, what a whiney trannsvesstite....here we are 20 years later and it's gotten worse, and he's in his late 70's with his nails painted
i laughed out loud when Lars said he played the guitar before James
kirk's got a strong west coast accent/vibe
As a solid stern hater, I’ll say I enjoyed this clip.
🤘 Metallica
Toan is in the ballz though
Love how as they're talking about Gary Moore, they don't use a picture of Gary Moore in Thin Lizzy.
That guitar should have its own bodyguard..wow!
It is possible to listen all the interview somewhere and not just some clips ?
Its a legendary item!
You're not getting this guitar back.. LMAO.
That guitar finds the most worthy player and rewards them with amazing music.
They all could've gone for a bite and they still would've been hearing that sustain.
Love that Kirk swaps from one 59 to another.
Greeny has still got the blues.
I'd love to talk guitars with kirk. He's such a guitar nerd
One of the magical musical items in the world.
Love the Thin Lizzy photo 😂😂 That's not Greeny, and it's not Gary Moore either 😂😂😂
This is awesome!!!
I'd say it's more yellowy though 🤔
Damn, Hetfield is looking very wide leggy. Good for him.
Not entirely sure that Gary Moore is celebrating in Heaven that Kirk has it now. Well, it's taken care of, that's what matters.
Hahaha I love how they tack abt greeny as if it was a girl
Jeff Beck AND Lars Ulrich played it? That's a keeper
Kirk is adorable hahha he loves what his doing so much . RESPECT
Joe Bonamassa played it.
He needs to route it out for a Floyd Rose.
I get the impression Hetfield is scared of that guitar for some reason
Wow. The people that have played that guitar. It's amazing.
Gary Moore! You honor that guitar, Kirk.
"you could go and have bite and you'd still be hearing that one"
He found his Great White Buffalo of guitars!
The greeny neck sound is just so Gary Moore sound
IMO. Greeny's strongest association is with Gary Moore as he held it longest and utilized  Greeny the best. Even as Kirk's the current owner, it would be very challenging to associate Kirk with Greeny, partly due to the type of music that Kirk plays. What's more important is that Greeny in Kirk's possession is not meant just for display.
Holy shit, that guitar is basically a sacred relic now.
Gary moore..🔥🔥🔥🔥🎸🎸🎸
But how much was it? 🙃
So how much did he really pay ?
this guitar has run the gamut of musical styles
"It's got great sustain..." (the note then dies on him!).
sassy
That guitar deserves a better player than KH. Just sayin'.
Albatross was written and played on a strat.
This guitar, wow, the sound of it. I'm a multimillionaire, I'm willing to pay 3 million dollars for that guitar.  If someone could give me Kirk Hammett's phone number I would really appreciate it
kirk and his only child
I love how Kirk Respects the guitars past players and connected with it!
The sound It’s got to be in the pickup … I mean it starts there obviously kirks hands etc makes it truly sing
It was meant to be
Is kirk on something?
I also draw the line at 2 million
wow damn
BEST guitar on earth ,maybe.
That gem of musical history is in good hands.
Rob, after the other three take turns saying they played the guitar: "Actually, I *made* the guitar."
Look at lars
It does sound fantastic.  I wonder if anyone makes a set of those pickups?
Thank you. For adding a few thousand dollars of equity to my 1991 R9 Gibson copy. I bought it back in 2000 for $800. I also have a Page R9, #1 still in the box!
The legend, i love them 🤘 greetings from Indonesia 🇮🇩
I love how Kirk has a very animated childish personality
With Dave's riffs too.😂
Stern's a punk.
That’s his baby now .
soooooooooooooooooo How much did he pay for the guitar,  he skipped that part.   It didnt any better than My guitar to me. Mine sounds really good & so does greeny./
Kirk is so adorable!!!
I’d have green hand cuffed to me
amazing how shit kirk makes this amazing guitar .. so sad
I’d love to just be a fly on the wall there. Gosh
❤️🤘💡🔥
0:28 James thought of a puppy cock joke 😂
Gotta respect the passion for your craft.  That guitar is literal magic for him.  It’s a beautiful thing.
What a legend and what a guitar
All I hear is Parisienne Walkways when I see that guitar
What a great story.....and I love how James keeps ribbing Lars! 🤣
It’ll go for $2M after Kirks done with it
Lol. And he manages to squeeze none of the tones that guitar is known for.  Now it's rubbish.  Lololol😊
FYI: Stern is not in the studio.  Metallica is on Kimmel all this week (Monday - Thursday).
I think it’s cool how much he loves the instrument I can relate to that
He still didn't say what he paid. But no doubt the price went up when Lars played it!
Bass-sik & way to wield an axe 😎
speaking a lot ... to say nothing
Spinal tap
he didn't said how mutch it was
It is nice to see how passionate Kirk is regarding his guitars ! He is a true musician, in every sense of the word. 👍
Gary Moore , one of the all time greats
Rory Gallagher played it. Enuff said
If i had the funds. I would have done the same thing. You can tell there is an aura in that guitar
Gonna mortgage my house for a replica, it should be a sound investment.
nice
Lars's reaction made it even more funnier.
Cool to see the Stradivarius of guitars get some mainstream attention. Good on Stern for it.
Gary Moore did legendary solos on that guitar RIP and his mate RIP Phil Lynott legend's. I think Parisienne Walkways by Gary with that big mad long sustained note was that guitar. I think Kirk paid a million for it.....
I love how passionate Kirk is when he talks about his guitars!
C'mon Kirk you didn't mention Gary Moore, it was his main guitar for i don't know, 20 years or more?
The sustain...Kirk had a Spinal Tap moment there. Except he actually played it!
Love these type of stories
Must have been so difficult for Kirk not to use his wah pedal.
Beautifull❤guitar😎🔥and great story❤
2:35 Jame's look, he dont care any about rig.
Good for Kirk!  Look how happy this guitar makes him.  Couple of million is nothing for him. YOLO
Kirk is a cross dresser. 100%!
I love how James is always in a stance whether he's playing anything or not, lol.
And now it's contaminated by Kirk Wah-Mett 😭
that guitar is sexy sound
The way James always rips on Lars is actually funny af but you know there’s love behind it
You had me at THIN LIZZY.
I’ve listened to Metallica for 35 years and this is the most I’ve heard him speak.
Best interviewer in the Bizzzzz!
Metallica sold out.
Robert also bought Jaco Pastorius' Bass of Doom.
I played Greeny before James or Kirk. I think Lars first played Greeny in 1976. I've played Greeny two different times. First, in '07 at the Arlington Guitar Show. Phil W. owned it then. I played Greeny plugged into a 18 watt Marshall clone made by Mission amps. Second time was at the Dallas Guitar Show in '08. Phill still owned it and I only played Greeny acoustically that time.
Amazing!❤
How much did he payed after all??
Love this content and also love them playing riffs in this setting because you can really see what they're doing❤ for a guitarist this is awesome
Just dreaming to own this guitar from him!
So maybe Kirk is a little light in the loafers?
When are the music videos dropping
Rory Gallagher played Greeny??? 😳
??? so how much did he end up paying for it ?????
Gary Moore did that guitar justice.
Lars still can’t take it when the others get attention.  Haha.
Gotta love Metallica. This is why Robert’s quiet personality fits so well with this trio.
Bow down to Greeny
Talking about guitars really livens up Kirk.
Does it go to 11 ?
How’s Kirk to his roadie? “Can you bring Greeny to me please?” What a legend
The story I heard Kirk paid 1 Mil for it.
The great Peter Green! The Original FM
Peter Green had the best tone of all time
So how much did he pay for it? half a million?
That sounded pretty F-ing sweet. The neck pickup is nice.
So he only paid $1.9 million or what?
Lars Urlich best guitarist <3 🤣
I love that he mentioned Rory had played it.
I’m impressed
"LARS ULRICH" lol
kirk is so passionate about greeny... its a beautiful guitar, i have seen it up close and its 🔥
Love how animated Kirk was in this interview
That tone is out of this world
What a story!  Awesome
Its gorgeous !
FULL EPISODE PLEEEASEEE
I love that Kirk has that guitar, especially because people give him so much shit for his guitar playing.
I love 59’s and the mystique , but I also can’t help but think of Spinal Tap when he’s talking about the sustain, lol.
how can you not love kirk
