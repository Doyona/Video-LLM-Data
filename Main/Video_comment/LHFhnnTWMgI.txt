I kind of wish you hadn't walked off camera with the open bag of steak before we got to see it. Would have been nice to verify that it was cooked before you walked away with it and went off camera into an obscured room, then had the edit, then showed us the steak perfectly cooked.   Idk you cut out the parts needed to verify.
😂😂😂. 6:45 time to slap some meat! 😂😂😂 that was funny
aint no way they called it the meat beater
Thus is more like a tutorial for boom boom time in the bedroom
How the hell did he cut that steak with plasticware?
This reminds me of spaghet
That one person who says he watches Educational videos the stuff he watches:
Clicked off the video when the C bullS**$T came on.
Is this a macro-wave?
He did name it meat beater 9001
Its not well done...
I think the Cyclops didnt need a microwave
Before I watch this, I feel like I already did. We shall see.
We all saw you change out the steak in the side room lol. Was really funny though.
Medium, highly tenderized.
4:51 🥚🥚🥚🥚🥚🥚🥚
9:20 jebać disa
God I hate celsius
2:10 bro simulated climate change
Cant tell the steak is real, as you walked away
60 degrees Celsius is 140 degree Fahrenheit, a cooked chicken is 165 degrees no lower, so therefor you failed to cook a chicken. Fraud
he's beating his meat
I just watched a man beat his meat for 12 minutes
Okay Jay Pritchett!!!
Gooners:
0:53 what about decreasing the size of a slaphand as much as possible, and increase the number of them as much as possible.  like, imagine billions of tiny-tiny units hands slapping a chicken from all sides, and— oh, wait
i return to this video
I'm here after watching a solid JJ meme about cyclops powers😂
Youtube algorithm at it again with the random recommendations 🤣
How you know this is the FIRST ever chicken cooked by slaps?
jd
Meat Beater 9001 😂
This is the kind of shit I need more of on my feed
Try cooking a chicken by rubbing it really fast next
stop yelling at me
bro really built a contraption that automatically beats meat
Did you season your meat before you slapped the shyt out of it?
There's no way I'm seeing this video years AFTER Unus Annus ended. Is this where they got the idea for that absolutely unhinged content???
The amount of time just to reach 40c would render that chicken unsafe to eat, even if heated to safe temps.
I can't get over how morbid and disgusting it is doing this to dead animals' bodies.
135k slaps! I'll remember that next time the power goes out.
Bro VICIOUSLY beat his meat
Next video: Cooking a chicken by screaming at it.
8:17 I’ll take your whole stock.
He likes to beat his meat for us, who am i to not watch
Knew a kid called the meat beater 9000 😂 he definitely wasnt trying to cook a chicken...
Kelvin is the scale used in real science.
I dont know would you like to eat that meat but im sure it still wants to eat your salad
So many things I want to say, but I’ll just leave it with this… Great vid
At least he didn't choke his chicken
10:18 that's what she said
Can you make a slapper that feeds you though?
This man must never meet Michael reeves or I fear they will be unstoppable. 💀
Slap a pizza next time
Like because of using °C. Based
Mmmm micro plastic chicken
Your room looks like Drake and Josh’s.
It's hard to imagine a less efficient form of heat transfer than this and I adore it.
Imagine showing it to someone from before WWI
The cooling of the motor proves this is an inefficient transfer of energy
Max the Meat Guy might wanna look at this.. 👀
I also cooked my meat by slapping it..
imagine living a happy life as a chicken but then being killed just to get slapped 100000 times
thank you Algorithm. my evening needed this
Should have tried to choke it until it was cooked
now this makes me wonder, how much could you pulp-ify a chicken by slapping
1:04 “The Original Meat Beater” is a insane nickname😭😂😂
i think abt this video way too often
🩵🩵
Not a satisfying end
Remember that one matpat video
I watched the original video years ago, completely forgot about it, but was beyond ecstatic when I saw this video pop up in my recommended YT feed. 4 years late perhaps, but congratulations on successfully cooking both steak and chicken via slaps!
Tenderized into paste
The slap cook™
This video is peak internet
how to get a hot wife
CINEMA
How many slaps does it take to date girls❤
8:26 when he said this i thought it meant he was finally going to season the damn meats. but then he pulled out a steak
don't give in to the other 95% of the world! use Fahrenheit!
Chaotic good engineering 🤣
I should go to sleep already, and yet here I am, watching a guy slapping chicken until it’s cooked…
Me throughout the day: I should sleep earlier tonight, lack of sleep is making me tired. Me at 3am:
So you gave the chicken the ol' Will Smith special!
This is the reason why I paid internet
Just as long as the real science does not have common core
nice spanking machine
I never thought anything would turn me vegan... But seeing a guy turbo slapping a piece of chicken with a medieval torture device at 3 AM finally did the trick.
"When I grow up i want to be a rockstar" *grows up to become absolutely violated by slaps*
0:44 HPC for the win!
We need to check this man's hard drive
10:19 you trust yourself with a 6hp slapper but not a steak knife 😂
Clickbait …. Selected “don’t recommend this channel” and gave this clickbaiter  a dislike
he should cook with clapping
Now you just need to design some sort of machine to tenderize it first....
Why am I watching this at 3am when I have an exam tomorrow
In other words this was an ultimate failure.
YT just recommended a video about some "free energy" machine, this time it was a permanent magnet from a speaker turned into an induction cooking plate and of course no energy added... They never run out of ideas!  But that video reminded me of your project, which illustrates in such a brilliant way that energy doesn't come from nothing and that heat for cooking requires a lot of energy!  I wish I could borrow your slapping machine to use it on some content creators!
That's a lot of effort just to beat your meat.
I'm not even going to bother leaving the comment I was planning to. I know someone else already said it 😂
Taking beating your meat to a whole nother level
This is the most important video I've watched all day.
There's nothing quite like a pre-chewed steak 😬
cutting steak with a plastic knife should be a crime
W milestone
Anyone here in 2025?
Meat beater 9001 😂 btw I am a chair 🪑
I didnt know youtube allowed you to beat your meat
Dude close your mouth while eating. God this is most disgusting.
Is it ok if I tattoo the name of your machine on my right forearm?
“Remove steak from packaging, place directly onto slap stove for approximately 100,000 slaps or until internal temperature reach 60 degrees Celsius.”
Negative energy efficiency.
You ate beat meat.
Cancer, water purification, pollution, farming with these smarts focus elsewhere. Time to slap a dead chicken?
Cooking food is bringing energy to break covalent bonds between molecules. Bringing energy by different media Like Water Fat, butter, oil Air Infrared and other radiation Microwave. Energy baby. By friction.? By conducting electricity? Put a sausage on two forks and let AC current through it. Just be careful to not electrocute ourself.
Spinning slapping on the wheel. HALLO? Be Eco friends, save some extra time and money.
THE MEATBEATER 9001  OMG HAHAHAHAHAHA
Fully hardened steal arms. And all kinds of bigger stuff.
So compared to just put it in the oven, how much does this cost?
The title made me laugh so subbed.
bunny is a rider
So, this is basically cooking by friction. That means you could also cook by rubbing your meat. That would also be a lot less force on the machine and more efficient.
I can't believe that 4 years have passed man I used to watch some streams of this experiment
I've cooked a ham by slapping it
It is great that you use metric units. You got like from me for that.
Bro this crazy😂
After you ate the steak did you get sick 😫 or get your stomach pumped
If nothing else this certainly slaps
Davie504 omg slap the like button now and slap the base
Naughty that you're slapping your chicken
"Perfectly cooked steak" cooks it med-rare with blood spilling out 🤢
Would this work for a 185 lbs chicken
1:03 mark rober ahh music
Matpat should be proud
Yo, do you play Xenoverse 2? (Specifically on Xbox.)
Even human ancestors the primitive people knows that fire is still the more common sense way to cook but slaping that food to cook it is downright crazy
Who is here in 2025
Banger idea cooking a hot pocket by slapping it
Wow so fast and so many it fills me with warm
I love how this project has found nearly every, single, thing, that can fail on a chicken slapper.
I can't believe it took YT four years to show me this.  This is the content I live for.
So slapping cook chicken? That very technical.
Я охуел когда на 2:47 саундтрек Маши и Медведя заиграл.
I love that as I watched this, I got an advert from Chicken Treat
Why do you sound like point crow so much
So what I'm getting out of this is that mega coomers have cooked their balls
Hid this so my cock doesnt see it.
If we forget how to make fire this could save us all
.. So much for at least bit of respect to the animal that dies so we can eat it. Haven't seen something this stupid in long time (and no I'm not vegan).
Didn't MatPat already do this?
9:22 polish people are everywhere xD
I cooked my chicken by beating it.    Careful who you tell.
Someone needs to show this to @TheRussianBadger given his jokes about cooking a chicken by punching it.
CHICKEN JOCKEY
I was slapping my chicken last night
Isn't the first iteration of a prototype supposed to be overbuilt? Then after you get it working, you start cutting costs for mass production. Why did it take you months of work to get a stronger motor and use steel for the part that obviously needs steel?
Someone call General Tao we got another guy who's chicken slaps!
You must be slapping wrong. When my parents did the slapping it only took one and my ear would be red hot.
I would have use a wall with multiple plastic arm instead that would eat the steak and bend
Do a collab with guga
The main resson we cook meat is to alter the flavour profile... Meat is already clean for the most part.
Farenheit is actually obhectively better than Celsius, or at least no worse. Continentals are coping. Imperial is actually better in most contexts, the french are just pretentious knobs
Huh? Isn't there a version where it fails? @.@
Guga collab when
The question actually was, how hard you have to slap a chicken in order to cook it on the first slap.
No seasoning?
And ur eating it with plastic utensils. Disgraceful
I can not believe what I am seeing here This might be one of the weirdest things the internet was kind enough to put in my algorythm
This is stupid and I hate that I love it. 🤣
stop lying
Would you like the chef to beat your meat for you sir?
Albert Einstein and Isaac Newton take notes. This type of science is what really matterse
Actually, my kindergarten teacher once turned her head so hard her ponytail slapped into my fave and sorta burnt my face.
Who up slapping their chicken?
Why thete 20k dislike on it? People dont get slapped enough i quess
It’s like an angry cat with the overhand slap! 😂
Meat beater 9000, uh huh 👍🙄😬😬☺️😏😏
go eat that uncooked chicken i dare you
that steak was raw snd you didnt even cook the chicken, 0/10
"Automatic meat beater". Hehe. 😏
Omg, it’s over 9000 😂
that guy said meat beater...
Now im going to kick the chicken till get seasoned
This is awesome! Kinda funny how some of these common sayings are  actually true. Word of mouth is very powerful but can evolve into false rumors like shown here
You need a 3 phase motor.
So the steak was too tender cause of over tenderizing it with slaps. Therefore you have to generate more heat with less slaps.
Bro use different words to explain something is the original meat beater sounds horrible
That chicken looked like a steak when it was done.
In school we had a physics problem for homework where we calculated how many shakes of a thermos it would require to boil the water inside. Also, that was probably some pretty tender chicken.
Poor chicken gave its life for this
The meat Beater 🤣🤣
Davie504: 👋
Human stupidity again demonstrated at its finest.
Remember. It’s best to take it off early. You can always put it back on. But what you can’t do, is un-slap a chicken.
What if you tried choking the chicken
dude why does the chicken start from room temp? all types of non food safe shit going on here. just how slowly it heats worries me
Which gained heat first? The chicken or the slapper?
Boy eat beef coming from the meat beater 9000 … white boys are cooked😂😂
Mom don’t come in I’m slapping the chicken for dinner!!!
I was 13 when I figured out heat and kinetic energy where basically the same.
So dumb
It makes sense that it takes twice as much energy as using an oven, because the slapper has to waste energy getting the arm wound back for each slap. Am I right?
so many chickens died for this, my heart goes out to them.
Everything reminds me of her 😢 😭
Redefining "spanking your meat."
This is the old “need to take my stake off camera just before I reveal it” trick. 9:40
salmonella
Someone should synch up Fist Of The North Star to the slaps XD
Literally Bartholomew Kuma's devil fruit.
This meal slaps
This is America folks jfc.
We thank thee, ol’ YouTube algorithm, for the journey hath been long, but the promised land is reached.
“I’m just saying, if physical energy can be turned into thermal energy. How many times would I have to slap a chicken to cook it?”
Bro back then be like:" And for these people I discovered fire...".
Bro really said the meat beater. Wow
You sure beat that meat
Kelvin is used for real science
I can't believe you didn't season any of those attempts. Just some salt, pepper, and garlic would have made me so happy.
bro, that steak is not cooked... Marinated, sure, cooked, no... Pretty sure thats why you didn't use pork or chicken, because you can eat steak raw...
You can cook with sound
Dude is gat
I got fooled that its a “I did a thing” video by the thumbnail
Don’t slap the chicken, choke it!
This is the dumbest thing I have ever seen, and it amazes me.
Why do you have a Nazi slogan in the background
“Meat beater”….dude took “wacking the chicken to another level “ 😂
Despite Celsius being an SI unit used in science, if you want to go a step further real science measures temperature in Kelvin.
Bro cooked
Who is here in 2025?
This video is genius however , 2:15 , Celsius is not "real" science, it is a European measurement of temperature where 0 represents frozen water. In Fahrenheit 0 represents frozen salt water?  Kelvin is real science. In Kelvin metric 0 represents absolute 0 where matter is so cold it stops vibrating. True 0. It moves up in same intervals as Celsius.
He could have at least seasoned this😅
Dude gave up on chicken because he had 0 faith. 😂
Sous ve-iyeeeeeet!
Some chicken really died to be slapped by a fucking monster built to increase the energy output of the universe
Someone in the patent department seeing a patent request for a meat beater for the 9000th time
Jello would be so happy
matpat caused this
Real Sienice uses kelvins to measure temperature
Not once in my life have I ever been this ecstatic about successfully slapping the meat.
I want Ramsey Gordon to walk into a restaurant and see this thing in the kitchen.
In China they probably would start to slap it alive.
How long until these are available for mass production? I want one for my birthday, for reasons…
Hit puberty so you have a man’s voice
Science!
How fall the dinosaurs have fallen
I’m glad this important question was answered.
I stumbled across here because I needed to escape the horror that is American Political videos.  This is not dissapoint.
You literally beat bacteria to death.
MB9001 is what I call my right hand
A microwave is pretty much the same. Just the slaps are like. Super small. And fast as hell. 🤷‍♂️
Be careful! If you beat your meat too much you'll go blind!
Modern girlfriend 1s after you break up with her.
Why °C? Wtf is keelowmetah?🦃🐔🐓🦅
4:18 ik im late If you can *smell* something through a mask made to filter any particles, then you know something is wrong
When my mom Beat me it was hot
No seasoning
davie504 would be proud
Could have ask howtobasics a hand
That one unempolyed friend on a tuesday
1, 2, 3, 4, beat your meat upon the floor Beat Your meat. Beat Your meat.
"Honey, I just got a new sextoy"
Three years after this video still masterpiece.
Matpat really motivated you that much 💀
Can’t believe the Russian badger joke actually happened
I'm scared for the electric bill lol
Science.
9:20 Jebać Disa xD
Me watching this video on food theory and hearing *meat beater* 💀 Edit: *69420 slaps* 💀 3:32
Mark Rober, but for stupid video ideas. Exactly my type of content.
"... Mommy, I watched a video of a guy who slapped his chicken. For over 8 hours! But he used a machine to beat his meat really, really fast, haha..." "Oh, god..."
stop yelling it's fucking annoying
In theory, I always understood that heat is due to the kinetic energy of molecules moving or vibrating. But I couldn't really believe in that explanation when it came to practice. This video helped me to believe that completely!
Meat beater😅😅
It's level is over 9000!
What about the heat from the slaps own mechanical movement, heating up the room? if this was done without hitting anything, wouldn't it still heat the room up slowly from the sheer movement
how many slaps to cook an egg?
I remember the first video. I almost barfed when the slaps pureed the chicken
Many men can beat their meat, but only one of true skill can defeat it -sun tzu
“Meat beater”
I have an idea about slap rate. What if you place a chicken in a 90 degree trench and hit it under a 45 degrees using 2 slappers from 2 different sides?
9:21 JD JD JD
You’ve made your own product
A waste of time and resources but I guess it had to be attempted 🤷🏼‍♂️
Ok. I'm just wondering why you didn't go with a wheel setup. Reducing the strain on the machine. Using springs attached to the wheel with whatever sort of slapping paddle affixed to that. You could increase slap rate while maintaining a single direction of the machine.
Meat beater
Holy Fook. Musk level intelligence.
Bruh no way I never watched the follow up video actually pulling it off
I despair. You people should be on mars by now and your wasting your brain power on this.  Stop slapping your chicken on YouTube and get to work.
1:05 The og meat-beater  Yeah, that's 🔥 name
❤
Why do you sound like that?
The “MeatBeater 9001” 💀
taking meat beatinh to a whole new level
Ngl, Bro COOKED
Davie504 need to see this
Davie504 would love this video
_ahem_ *WET*
Is it possible to have the chicken slapper slap the chicken with a more centrifugal slap so that the centrifugal force will generate more slaps thus slapping the chicken more times?
10:25 "honestly.... It SLAPS"
What if you used the heat from using the motor to also cook the chicken?
davie504 shed a tear
I legit just found this video and all my brain is thinking right now is: "Why would you ever cook like this?"
Should have made a cam follower and guide to stabilize the motion of the motor and reduce stress on arms and unwanted movement.
Humans...
The chicken steak? The CHICKEN steak? What the fuck is wrong with humanity.
I rewatched it now and i wss sure ror like two years, you named it "the wife beater 9 000", i even told.my pal that..
I love the human mind.
Recommended is out of control 😂tell me why I'm watching this
Snacked down crank whisker
My dad reaches higher temperatures when I return from school with a F.
He did it..
Cooked and tenderized at the exact same time.
Way to beat that meat… pause.
I know I'm a bit late, but why not just use an old washing machine motor, if it can spin a barrel full of clothes, it should surely be able to spin a chicken slapping machine 😂
So would this count as baking or grilling?
1:04 That was my nickname in high school
Add an alternator on to the motor to reduce energy consumption, use a braced flexible arm for the slaps to reduce impact on the machinery - or maybe use a fully rotating slapper to make use of the centrifugal force to slap harder whilst balencing out your slaps per second need more slaps add more arms etc
Imagine telling someone you watched a video about how to slap cook a chicken.
Salmonella goes brrrrrr
No need to tenderize
Perfected tenderizing and cooking at the same time
My science teacher played this video in class 💀
I just be watching anything
s l a p   r a t e
There is no way I just watched a guy beat his meat for 12 minutes
skibidi                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            type fein if u made it this far
I mean, if you didnt eat it, ya didnt cook it
1st video ive seen of yours and the mark vibes are way too heavy sir. I mean even the music ffs!!!
> Says chicken > cooks steak
I can use the unit Feklikte as long as it converts into actual math. "Used in real science" is just rude and probably racist.
I return to this video once a year 😂😂
Don’t let Howard Wallowitz anywhere near this thing
Keep fuckin' that chicken
If this guy had Asian parents his own 🍑 would be next victim of Slapping Machine for wasting this much 🐔food....🤣🤣🤣🤣
Gives another meaning to the question:"dude, is it ok if I slap your meat?"
waste of food, waste of energy, waste of earths resources and a waste of my time. RIP
i'm really proud of you.
That's a lot of beating your meat.
I honestly can’t tell if the chicken is cooked it’s in Celsius
my youtube algorithm at 2am
This is the dumbest thing I've ever seen, I love it lol
The meat beater😂😂 had me dead
Now do it in one slap
How fucking long is this Hello Fresh commercial?
You were put here to answer the one question you still cannot. When is a rapid succession of mechanical slaps too fast to be categorized as a slap rather than vibrational energy transfer instead depending on the rebounding tendency of the material being slapped? Many paths to cooked things glory! Awesome video! BUT also your consumed meat from this has been fully integrated with microplastics because microplastics and we store those in the testes that turn us collectively into fem-boys now. Congratulations, we played ourselves.
Why. But also thank you.
Ayam Penyet
Wait I thought he was cooking a chicken, why did he end up with a steak
You, sir, are a genius!
I don’t understand how the steak ended up brown. Food browns due to the Maillard reaction, which does not occur during sous vide or slapping. Did you sear this steak off camera after slapping?
adjustable slap depth 😅😂
From all of those bad bearings wearing off, I wouldn't eat it.
It was stressing me out how you put your face near the device while it was running. 😬😳
This gives beating your meat a whole nother meaning.
I was about to slap my chicken….then I saw this video! Better late than never. 😂
I been slapping my chicken mmmm
i have a meat beater
TENCELLL WOULD BE PROUD.
Apparently they were originally going to see if they could cook a salami using this method.
I like to imagine you did all this experimenting of slappcooking just to at the end get a good sponsortransition for hello fresh
This make beat the meat to another level
meat beater 9001
Is this back on my home page bea sue of thanksgiving? 😂
8:50 for whoever wants to see the slapping 10:56 the other slapping
You could of have use some seasoning at least salt😂
I was laughing before I even started watching
Cuts steak with plastic fork.
I know...3 year old video... but at 4:50, it got me thinkin' Did humans start to cook their food, in order to kill bacteria... Or to make it easier to chew...  I know the answer should be obvious, but idk... taking into consideration that the pork-ban for muslims originated from the fear of diseases. (warm climate + pork...u know)
This bold feat of engineering is equivalent to man’s landing on the moon. What a time to be alive.
Thinknoodles seeing this video       SLAPPPPSSSSS
Cock slapper cooker
I wonder if it can slap me tho😢
Matpat must be proud
"The design is very human."
And babe wonders why I refuse to slap her behind in public  Can't bake the cake with all the hungry folks around; that's disrespectful to the hungry and deprived. And I want it all for myself!  As I learned from a wise man with 160 IQ, “Hero? No! We're pirates! I love heroes but I don't wanna be one! Do you know what heroes are? Say there is a chunk of meat. Pirates will have a banquet and eat it but heroes will share it with other people. I want all the meat!” - Monkey D. Luffy  I'm a gentleman and a scholar, you see.
Asa was here
Don't beat the meat in November
pretty much cooks and tenderizes at the same time, interesting concept
I always love when so much intelligence and skill goes into accomplishing something so pointless and stupid.
Now try it with a fish
man we all love the dedication here
When Hydraulic Press Channel starts giving you advice, you know the shit just got pretty bad...
The essence of beating meat
Unus Annus would be so proud
Millenia of human tech ological advancements cumminating in this. Cooking a chicken by slaps. Profound.
Yasss hammer that meat
I watched this 3 years ago and landed on it again, so watched it again ha
5:38 for some reason the bags of snow threw me off. I guess I was expecting bags of ice.
HowToBasic must try this one
The master of slap battles
Poultry is absolutely revolting,🤢🤮
When choking the chicken just wont due 😂
😂 meat beater
You scream too much
Amazing. Now cook a hot pocket by spinning it. For science.
Why do all these dudes sound so gay? Im not even being a dick i just dont get it everyone i click on sound like p town tour guide
The answer for TheRussianBadger
You just switched to steak so you could say you cooked something,  we all know you couldn't reach 165º
Why did you make it so that the metal arm would hit the floor every time it swings?
Can I take your order?  Yes, I'll have the slapped chicken.
What has the world come to?
8:20 “The Meat Beater” is NASTY WORK 😂
5:18 almost expected the word "head" there too
The biggest travesty is him cooking a steak to 60c/140f.
I don’t really care about the results. I came for the comments 😂
So if I train hard enough, I will never need a fuel source of any kind again except the meat I beat?
Im wondering what good ol Gordon Ramsay would say about this chicken?
This is supposed to be YouTube, not PornHub.
Oh yea 😑
Won’t even make any bad jokes just because I’m genuinely impressed I tip my hat and give it to you sir!
Now do a hot dog
KSC = Kentckey Slap Chicken.
Meat beater 9000. Okay….. I’m listening.
Eating that steak with a plastic knife and fork was a travesty
I kept thinking u we’re gonna eat the raw tests and I was saying please no
first time watching u(earned a new subscriber), legit thought it was matpats voice in the first scene lmao
I'm 14 weeks pregnant and every time I think my morning sickness is gone I see some shit like this to remind me that it's still with me
🤢🤢🤮🤮 get a bucket guys this is not safe for human consumption
How mad scientist are born😂😂
You can this guy beat his meat for years so he got bored and started this project😂😂😂 make sense💀💀
*Ultimate torture device..*   😈
"Hey honey, look, this guy slaps chicken until it cooks" *Stares at wife cake intensely*
You know how a piston in a combustion engine moves up and down? You could have attached a piston like machine directly to such a combustion engine and with some height adjustment you'd have your chicken beater without that flimsy wood, long ass lever and electric engine. Honestly I believe you did those bad versions on purpose so you could make more videos
Tenderizer and cooker in one. Save like two seconds in total on prep time
Shit american society.
Humanity is constantly evolving in the path no one was ready for
@8:17… the WHAT??
Ppl are getting dumber and dumber 😂 imagine to be entertained by watching a butt for an hour😂.
Taste of success
That holy cow bracket made me laugh 😂
I came here for cooked chicken left with no cooked chicken :(
You should have added a bit of warmth to the metal slapper so that it mimicked that of the warmth of a hand.
I clicked because of the title 😂😂😂
1:06 meat beater💀
This but with my balls
cool, *yawn*.
Dude, matpat, get over here
Still not possible.  He didn't use a HUMAN hand.
Let him cook. *slaps faster*
Make this comment have 5 likes
Something about the pulpification of chicken by ferocious slap machine is just too funny to me. 😂😂
Now cook it with one slap
You remind me of my institute study friend, he was like the guy who was very excited about things that happen to succeed and embrace the ups and downs but has the enthusiasm to keep trying
Now we can finally beat the meat without any hard work
Stop being your meat on the internet. It's unbecoming.
"Its the scale used for real science." Unless you're going to the moon or building stealth bombers.
BY THE POWER OF SLAPZ I PRONOUNCE YOU ARE COOKED!!!!
I'm so happy it turned out bad otherwise we'd be seeing this gimmick at a premium price in restaurants all over California and New York
This video slaps.  Sorry, I had to
Can you cook a chicken by shooting it ?
Si el calor se transmitió por el brazo ?
Congrats on building your meat beater
To think that this is what people had to go through for a medium rare steak before fire was invented
........Ok, so hear me out....
Moto “You can’t beat our meat”!
I clicked on this video to watch a meat get beat and i was not disappointed.
11:55 Nasi tu byli
Is this human progress or its decent into madness?
Nice very respectful use of the chicken. ⬜️⬜️⬜️⬜️
Wheres skulker? Someone call badger
Also the fda allows a certain amount of rat feces for food to be sanitary. The fda is literally a double edge sword.
If only he could cook the chicken on the equipment used to run the meat beater
Last time I saw this myth being tested was on Mythbusters, but I am glad to see others test the myth.
Would seasoning the chicken have affected the process? If not, why not season yo chicken fam?
bro's straight microplasticmaxxing
So if I beat my meat fast enough, it will cook?
How many slaps would it take to set Coiny's face on fire? A BFDI qeustion 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Meat beater
Seems like this requires a shit ton of asterisks. "We cooked a steak with slaps **and a sous vide."  "We cooked a chicken with slaps **retroactively noticing we made the bare minimum of pasturization, but still not hitting our goal of 60C"  I guess that is where the sayiny comes from. "If at first you dont succeed, lowet your expectations."
"I'm just saying... if physical energy can be turned into thermal energy... how hard would I have to punch a chicken to cook it?" - Jello, Russian Badger Crew, TACTICAL FRIED CHICKEN | World of Tanks  Well, we got our answer.
Anyone send this video to Badger yet?
there is no world in which I'm taking a bite of chicken "cooked" via pulverization.
Nice nice
Slap cooked chicken brought to you by VTEC
3 years late, but why not use a wheel with floppy rubber paddles that slap the chicken? More stable, faster, less breaking points.
Is do the opposite, how hard of a slap you have to slap to cook the chicken in 1 slap
Alt title: how to torture your wallet
What is creating the heat from the slaps is it friction or something else?
The title to when i turned 16.
Fail. Dint add that salt and peppa
It’s funny how your biggest problem with cooking is keeping everything cool
So if you can slap a chicken to cook it how hard and how long will I have to punch it to make the most tenderized and cooked piece of meat
9:55 bro acting like its a whole different food 😂😂😂
2:36 Me when I get a subscriber
Meat beater is going crazy in 2024
°C isn't the real unit scientist use, it's Kelvin or K
Not me fast forwarding to the end and wondering why he’s eating a steak, not a chicken 😳
9:22 jebać disa
I didn't ask for it. Not gonna watch it
this guy is unfamily friendly mark rober
“Meat beater”
how would you like your meat  "beaten" 💀💀💀
Hello future me. I had already seen this like 3y ago
Favt the way he cooked it was because he made kinetic energy so much that he could heat up the chicken
Waiter: How would you have your chicken cooked?  Louis: slapped  (Joke credit: someone in internet)
What a waste of energy, now thanks to your useless increment in entropy we are closer to the end of the world💀
jebac disa idealnie weszlo
Let him cook
i wonder if it would be easier to rise up the temperature if the chicken was inside a metallic container which was then slapped, it seems to lose temperature and this will lead to an eventual treshold
😂 meat beater 😂
Redefining "beating the meat"
You never spent much time with girls did you bro?
One step closer to stopping climate change.
*Builds elaborate aluminium slapper arm powered by swivel attached to quality gear wheel and electric motor  *Mounts to some spare lumber
Some people clap cheeks some clap chicks 😂
Couldn’t you add a flexible piece to the arm? I think it would reduce the tension peaks that seem to be causing a lot of the failures.
LET HIM COOK!!!
Why didn't you just put paddles on a wheel to make a slapper?
The chicken got cooked
Wait a minute... he didn't cook it properly because you have to HOLD it a 60C° for an hour but he immediately took it out as soon as it hit 60C° skill issue for not having realized that
Meat Beater is a crazy name 😭😭
1:05  you know what you said there.
My spanking-loving ex-girlfriend would have loved this machine.
Bro thinks hes mark rober 💀
It’s like shit, but if you can get past that, it’s pretty good.
Are you saying that you've created a prototype for our dystopian future in space for cooking real food, as the food could be in a vaccuum slapped, and eventually get heated to an edible tempurature? Are you TRYING to earn a bazillion gajillion dollars?
happy Shrek 😏
3, 2, 1, the ad kicks in. Perfect timing, YouTube.
Not to be thaaaaat guy but, as a chef/cook myself, that chicken ain’t safe to eat. Though it was denatured through correct time and temperature controls, the chicken remained in what was known as the [temperature] danger zone for an extended period of time. Toxins can develop in these danger zones that make food no longer safe to eat even through denaturing or cooking to safe temperature. To simply this is the reason why if say you cooked rotten meat from dead wild animal, no matter what temp it’s cooked at, it is no longer safe to eat. Everyone’s immune system is different though but still best to avoid food safety threats even if one is not immunocompromised. p&l <3
I was here when this came out
I was here when this came out
1:05 the what!?
Is that mark robers sound?👀
How can it slap? HOW CAN IT SLAP?
so dont slap your meat too much or youll cook it
Wish I got to buy a mini *meat beater*
9:36 should have aimed for 69
Du pur water chicken mon bro c'est ultra quoicoubeh le poulet que tu nous a lâché
He could have at least seasoned it
Can you hard boil an egg through kinetic force? seems harder cuz you cant break the shell, but it also has built in insulation. Maybe spinning it or otherwise using g force would work? Can you cook something by accelerating it?
He took the expression "beating his meat" to another level 😅
no
I'm supposed to sleep
It's funny how you copies everything from Mark Rober. From the music to the manner of speaking. The montages are the same also. A big difference thought is that you don't have the same engineering skills. You're machine breaks so many times ! 😂
All the wars all the inventions I’m honestly so glad this is the generation I was born into
Will Smith would love to learn this way of cooking chicken.
I wonder at how many slaps a 3D printed chicken would cook
1:04 that music is licenced by mark rober
Meat beater 😭😭😭😭
commie sympathizer
I'm curious if Gordon Ramsay would ever try cooking in this fashion XD
6:23 i got watch history paused so time dont save
Who 2024??
I'm The Original Meat Beater
Un f😅
blud took ima beat my meat to a whole different level
So this is like sous vide slapped meat
7:30 what's with the balloon in the background
At 12:24 bruh did not like that food 😂 but bruh smart ash dawg
Who’s here from Slap Battles?
Haters will say I'm watching this video instead of doing my science homework. This counts as science so I'd argue I am doing my science homework; I'm learning.
Is it Lou-y or Lou-is
Spread the gospel you never know when Jesus is coming back and have an amazing day God bless you all
That meat is probably full of microplastics from beating the bag lol
I wonder if you built a "Wheel Slapper" if that would be more efficient and last longer. Instead of up down up down, it will be a constant stream of slaps
dateng gr" channel bg mikes
Will Smith would be proud
Mark Robert song you stole it
Little do people know when he walked away to the other room a person handed him a cooked beef.
I bet the taste absolutely SLAPPED

Mark Rober song 🧿👄🧿
this gives "beating the meat" a whole new meaning
You think this is something porn addicts have to worry about
I did this by drumming instead of using a machine 😅 vid is on my channel!
i think cook using pressure is the effective way to cook than slap....
Not the *MEAT BEATER* 😭😭😭
10:30 it tastes pre-chewed LMAO
Will that counts as a CPR?
Pasti ada yg mampir sini setelah lihat yt short nya youtuber indo itu, tentang memasak ayam make tamparan 😂

What is that song played at timestamp 9:54, I have been trying to figure it out for so fkn long.
I can sleep peacefully tonight
I told my mom I was watching this video and she gave a very concerned look.
your voice sounds like mark rober with a slightly higher pitch voice
😅😅😅fue a cambiarla 😅😅😅
I wish newton was alive to see this today
F
What about speedrun to cook chicken from slap
btw they are mesured in kelvins
bro is gonna clap all those chicks
say the texture is good for old people who don't have strong teeth, learn to marketize lol
If you're going to use the same music as another channel you should probably not have picked Mark rober
Ohh inii
He said, "...The original meat beater..."  I'm through.
this is history too.
C’ha messo quasi due video a capire che doveva tagliare il pezzo di legno sotto la ruota, in modo da far girare liberamente il perno… gg
Bro took beating his meat literally 💀
Sometimes, the algorithm suggests weird things. This, however, I searched for.
Kesini gara gara mike namparin ayam
You could have also just cooked it in water😂 Im sure it wouldn't have taken months😂
I just realized that he used the mark rober backround music  2:28
1:55 looks so wrong ngl
Hi my boyfriend who is a chemist won't agree with me that you could maybe make popcorn pop if you slap it enough. I think you should slap popcorn.

Man go to Guga Foods to put some spices to that steak or msg and dry age the slap out of it
Imagine dying seeing what this man does to your body. 💀
ooo ini
I remember watching this 2 years ago, and it came up in my feed. I love watching it still
Tht chicken is not cooked 😂
Can i buy it
Anyone here from jumpers jump😂😂
Technically  beating your meat...
Fun fact: Atilla the Hun and his armies used to tenderize and season their meet by placing a slab of beef under their cheeks while riding horse back. Not even kidding
Sorry i dont understand the data you used Celcius
Maybe senior citizens in nursing homes would appreciate a good steak thats requires minimal amount of chewing.
Mans took beating his meat to the next level
My science teacher talked about this video. I came here, good work
I'm using the chicken to measure it.
There is a difference between cooked and safe to eat. In theory you could soak the raw chicken in 37 degree alcohol for 10 mins. The chicken will be raw asf but it would be sterilized and safe to eat. Cooking is a process of permanently misshaping the proteins in the meat.
Yeah, but why? lol
There is no stupid Science but it is pretty stupid to watch xD i like.
11:54  i ten typ od JD xDDD
Que video de mal gusto ...
Meatbeater9001 💀😂
holy reddit
This is the video I was watching when I found out my dog had cancer
The phrase “let’s go!” Will be the stain on this time in history. Apart from that, this was a fantastic video.
<3
next video, put your pee pee there.
I have never seen so much effort for such a ridiculous sounding premise. Well done!
Blud thinks he’s Mark Rober💀
holy shit, I saw the first video some long time ago, but I never knew he succeeded at this!!
I think my upstairs neighbor has one of these.
judging from your data, my penis has been overcooked for about 30 years
I feel like im watching a son of Mark Robber and I did a thing 😄 Keep up a good work
Clucksengan.
Now....what happens if we used this one someone's butt?
The real problem is even if you eliminate the bacteria, since you are cooking the meat so slow, these bacteria will spread toxins all throught the meat. You will kill the bacteria eventually but not the toxins and that is a big NO-NO.
gross i do not even like chicken cooked at medium heat
You're the ultimate meat beater
now that is beating your meat with purpose
How many times to choke a chicken before its cooked?
NICE! :D
Can't believe I'm watching a guy cooking dinner with slaps at 4 am. Great vid.
I come from a food theory with this very video referenced in it.
so the moral of the story, is beat your meat
Great! Now it's time to make a Slap Chop! 🤣
This question was included in last year's physics A level paper, lmaoo
who let bro cook?
so technically you cooked a steak not a chicken.
literally beating your meat
Had my chicken cooked like that once.
I beat my meat until it catches fire as well.
I could slap you whilst cooking a chicken quicker 😂
Hm, multiple slapping mechanisms could greatly assist in the wear and cooling of motors and parts. With 4 devices sharing the slapping load, each individual one doesn't need to be so vigorous or so fast. You could much more accurately control the amount of force in the slap (thus reducing pulpification) and yet still achieve a higher speed, while greatly reducing the odds of a motor or other part breaking or overheating.  You could use 4 slappers, one on each side, slapping the chicken from a sideways angle (you could even hang the bagged up chicken on two rods along the Z axies to keep it stable and ensure more of the energy is going into the chicken and not into inertia)- each one slapping in sequence so that not too much force is applied at once.
hahaha "you're slapping all the water and oils out of it that won't end well" .. hahaha
Coming next: Cooking a chicken by slapping it one time.
This is weirdly satisfying to watch.
And people still throw a fit when their Corolla takes a dump with 180k miles on it. This video really made me appreciate modern combustion engines. Imagine 4-8 of those Chicken Slapper 2000s going way faster, with explosions powering them, long enough to move an object as heavy as a car 100,000 miles and never breaking.. through multiple winters and putting off oil changes and heat and speeding up and slowing down.. think about it the next time you're not walking or riding a horse to the grocery store.
Gordon Ramsey took notes. He realized this whole time he was wrong
I would not be able to see videos like yours if it wasn't for my son who me up with these entertainment.  Thank you son.
me if I was doing it: slap, slap, slap onto a pan in an oven
amazing
So you’re saying that I CAN heat spaghetti by slapping it 🤔
The title says chicken but he cooks a steak?
Now we have the answer, Badger can tell his crew.
Less about slapping meat to edible temp and more about bad engineering.
¬We have ohh so much explaining to do before God I love it.
How about a slap wheel? For a slap up meal
Some real slap steak comedy!     Waka waka waka!
This is an abomination. Aren't it ?
I reckon that slapped steak would go good with a nice sear.
woudnt it be easier to create something like a watermill, but the slaping part would be flexible, because hes just hammering food and not slaping...
you lived your chicken life and died your chicken death.  you’re a curious chicken ghost, returning to this plane of existence to see what has become of your body and:
funny how alienated humans can be
Wtf....15 million views? Damn.
WAIT THATS THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF SLAPS?
Just another day when Americans keep inviting new units of measurement
Am I the only one who sees a perfect resemblance in the way of speaking to Mark Rober?! I mean the arrangement of sentences, words, questions, and even intonation breaks.
One could say you were beating the meat.
Its the easiest way to cook chicken.   I hope KFC and McDonald’s will adopt this method.
Most expensive way of chicken cooking
After watching this I’m surprised my dork isn’t cooked a half dozen times a day….I’m mean once a day….wait, am I talking out loud?
If you do it again put the new chicken on the stick... it will get slapped on two sides.

wow
Davie504 like this
nice steak it's a really big goal and you did it.
Now all you need is a chicken choking machine.
Memento mori
A pimp could cook you a serious meal with the back of his hand in just under 4 hours
Next, you must choke it.
slap battles reference
why didnt you eat chicken
could've doubled the slapping amount had you just mounted the chicken half way between the up and down, would've cooked more evenly, too. It probably could've saved you a lot of power and effort too
I challenge you to boil water by slapping it, no bags allowed.
Me after Roblox Slap battles:
Can you imagine scientist back in the 1920's wondering what sort of experiments we'd be up to over 100 years later into the future? Cuz there's no way they were imagining this.
Wait, he left the room.....he switched steaks.🤔
Now do it with a living chicken
beat that meat
honestly it is one of the most dumb shit ive ever seen, but i watched it till the end
Isnt that beef
" like you've been chewing it for a bit" lmfao
he slaps the chicks
Davie504 approves this method of cooking
Every restaurant should have a meat beater 9001 😅
Why are you in petersripols garage
has anyone ever cooked their own penis this way? asking for a friend
Chicken little died for this.
Hey @davie504 this could be us
You could have at least seasoned the meat...

Just got an Vegan advertisment
I liked my own comment
definition of beating your meat
Meat beater 9001 is crazy
In the UK a Slapper is a female that mates with lots of men. I’ll have three please.
Thats cool but i would never eat something that was slapped lol
😂 no comment
Enough internet for today
I wanted to spell a joke, but... Uhh.. I forgot my line.
Plap plap plap get cooked
One day your beating meat in the lab next thing the technology is picked up by the UN n beating meat to end hunger in Africa God bless the Human race 😂😂😂  couldn't finish this with a straight face 😂😂😂😂
Can you cook a pork by slapping it?
The energy wasted just to cook a chicken in this experiment is out of this world. I think the machine efficiency here is somewhere along the lines of 1% efficiency. Kudos to you for creating the most inefficient machine known to mankind!
SUCCESS! I'm late to the party but success!
Are you beating your meat? Or choking your chicken?
Dude took beating meat to a whole different meaning.
Slap Battles players:

so you cook it by beating it's meat.. i see
Ok. Why?

WTF THAT STEAK WAS A PERFECT MEDIUM RARE THAT LOOKS LIKE A SUIS VIDED STEAK
Rark mober💀💀
Waiter: How'd you want your meat cooked sir? Me: Just slap the shit of it until that mofo is done, please. Waiter: Very good sir, I'll inform the head slapist
Nice DiGiovanni would be impressed
Why am I watching this?  How did I get here?
If it took that many slaps to cook the chicken, then imagine that molecues are striking you 132k times EVERY 0.1 OF A SECOUND
lm 2 years late
This gives a new meaning to the phrase "beating my meat"
*POV: you're playing slap battles:*
This is real Science people. I think slap cooking a Boston Butt would have been equally entertaining.
Ah yes, this video was a legend.
Don't beat your meat too much, or it might get cooked
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Click bait crap. No chicken was cooked
where can i get YOUR SHURT!!!!
Welcome to Meat Beat Where we beat your meat💀
You beat the meat to cook it... huh... what a strange phenomenon...  Can you do it with other meats too? 😳
here's an idea, why not build something useful?  🤪
so you think thats how Gordon ramsay beat his meat?
How many slaps does it take too cook a chicken? Domestic abuse comes to mind 💀
🧢
Louis deserves his own Netflix show. I'm just glad to be a part of something that really matters.
i don't know science but ... doupt it .
Just use an oven
As much as we like measuring in Celsius, the science (a.k.a SI System) uses Kelvins

How To Be Simply Saved 1. The bad News. We are sinners. (Romans 3:23.) We deserve to be punished in hell for our sins. 2. The Good News. Jesus Christ who is God's Son died on the cross for all of your sins. He was buried & rose again to give you eternal life in heaven as a free gift. (1 Corinthians 15:3-4. Romans 6:23.) 3. How am I saved? Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved. (Acts 16:31.) 4. Once saved, always saved. Jesus said in John 6:47. Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life. Do you believe that you are saved by grace and promised heaven because Jesus died for you? Yes_No_

Slapper Steak recipe: Use a medium thickness Sirloin steak and half an onion in the bag. After slapping, the steak should be tenderised and thin, the onion enzymes should help with this process as well.  To finish, drizzle with black pepper sauce.

Celsius is used for real science, unless that science is flying, nuclear fission, going to the moon, winning world wars, automobiles, computers, or the internet.
The crazy thing is that I got a food theory video right next to this one asking the same question that you answered.
Cool vid but why did you copy everything mark rober does, even his music and the way he talks? Slack
You've herd of slam dunk but now we are introducing slam cook
this is the budget version of Mark Robert
This chicken hits different.
Remember your 50°-130° time needs to be under 6 hours to effectively pasteurize poultry.
chickem
So what you are telling me is the Food Theory channel ripped you off?
Has somebody told Heavenly about this?
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Спасибо!
We spent so long asking ourselves how, we never stopped to ask ourselves: Why?
in the times of human first learned to hunt they also find out to cook it on fire for better taste and get disseses out now some of us trying to cook meat by slapping it... and also like im not that bio person but that is a dead chicken body like just some appriciation for the dead chicken (sry for bad spelling)
9:41 bro looks suspicious going to the other room 🧐
Its no propane but ill bet slaps are better then charcoal. You'll taste that meat not the heat

Bill Gates please tell me how I ended up here.
No part of the reason modern humans cook their food is because it kills bacteria etc. However even though that could be claimed as, a, reason it's not really as we cooked food before we knew anything about bacteria, etc because it made it taste better, it was easier to eat and in some cases keep longer and those remain the biggest reason we cook our food today. Yes we cook certain foods to certain temperatures and set times to ensure its, safe but there's still many people who don't care about that at all as, long as they know how fresh the food is, if it's going to be safe to do so, etc.
howtobasic would be proud
Wait a minute. I thought this was a video about chicken.
Imagine dying, becoming a ghost, just to see your lifeless body getting slapped the shit of till it's cooked
That one person in the chat spamming jebać disa made me laugh ngl
Brings a new meaning to the “Turkey Slap” or “Beat your meat”. 😂😂😂😂

This is one of the dumbest things I've ever watched and I absolutely loved it hahaha I'll be checking out your other vids! Thanks for the content :D
Bro went out of the room with the bag of steak and came back.......how do we know someone didn't just switch him a real cooked steak when he did that...
Bro that is no chiken......

One of the biggest Ws on YouTube
I accidentally cooked my girlfriends butt because I slapped it too much.   (I’ve been single since I was born)
Is this where the line starts?
“The original meat beater also had a fundamental problem”   Ok just call me out
An idea for looser and faster slaps. Instead of having the arm rotate back and forth, make it spin around. Then you could make the arms less ridgid for looser slaps, attach more arms for faster slapping.
I would love that things to slap my chicken balls.
Why not an slap wheel ?
you'd think it'd liquify before heating up significantly
0:57 "Oh hey, this Mark Rober video is wicked!"  "...wait a minute..."
The heat capacity equation is  Q=cm[T2-T1], you burned the engine because of the chicken’s size, and instead of attaching an ice to the pole, you decided to start cooking from 40 degree, and smaller piece. So, the lack of calculations makes this video hilariously dumb😅
Have I reached the end of the internet?
You get a like good sir for an respectable milestone

Kelvin is the temperature used in science.

@Davie504
Useless
And meat eaters call vegans weird. I’m sure it’s all true.
this why my girf wants my slaps, she getS literally Hot XD
its a perfect rare:)
So that’s what will smith was trying to do to Chris rock 😂
Vegans gonna hate
Make a food truck serving slap chicken you can name the truck “Slap Chicken Kitchen”
i tried it and works... i cooked my wife butt
Where’s the seasoning
Slapmonela
Wow! This chicken should be ultra-tender now
I really can't believe this worked
They did surgery on a grape
So if I beat my meat 35000 times it's cooked?
This guy really knows how to beat his meat
That one person : Ugh that guy beating his meat, again.
This is what youtube is for. Yes.
Me finally realizing why my wiener is burned
Dear centigrade heads. Kelvin would like a word.
So we all just gon ignore the fact that he cooked a steak on the stove then presented it chicken
The chicken has no peace even after death😂
- Что это у тебя за звуки? - Я отжарил курицу 😎
Davie504 approves this video
Now that is beating your meat this time with a machine and chicken
mark rober wannabe
This video feels a lot like mark rober and I’m loving it!!
Isn't that the same question how many licks does it take to get to the Tootsie Roll center of a Tootsie Pop
Basically slap battles but slap a chicken 1000 times
This slaps
Meat Beating Machine 😅
Bro that steak looks like Minecraft steak before it’s cooked
why do all these engineers on youtube use the same music
Bro just cook it in the oven🤦‍♂️
Just Beat It! - Michael Jackson
I was hoping you would have mentioned this, but I didn’t hear anything.  Why not use a large wheel and attach a flapper every 12” and place the chicken right outside the wheel so when it spins, it will slap the chicken.  Kinda like the wheel on wheel of fortune or price is right.   Seems like that would have been an easier method. But maybe you tried it and I just didn’t see that part.
How To Basic In smart way
That's what I call *whipping up* a meal.
Imagine being a chicken, after dying being sold for well, eating, and after someone buys you he just starts SLAPPIN' YA
And here I thought I found every possible way to beat my meat
Feels like you’re actually playing etg while talking about this
why do you look like dream🙁
bro took spanking his meat to a whole new level
"Meat Beater 9000" ...sounds like a damn men's sex toy 😂🤣
11:55 Polskość
Bro did I just see you use a table saw with no fence to butt your piece up to lol your a mad lad
Bro even uses the Mark Rober music lmaoi

Science requires sacrifice. In this case you sacrifice your butt to diarrhea.
11:50 polska na czacie
Let him cook😂
Let him cook
This is another level of "besting your meat"
This is what happens when you beat your meat too much.
9:00
You've never had chicken until you've had slapped chicken.
Imma go cook my girl’s booty
Mark Rober but not NASA
I'm gonna have to stop slapping my girls ass 20 times a day as don't wanna cook it
Remember lads do not try beating your meat like this at home
😂😂😂😂
I always slapp hot ass never knew you could make ass hot with slap
I can't believe I sat here and watched another man slap chicken for 13 minutes.
So canonically the flash can make  fryed chicken with a single fucking slap
You really just need to work that cardio 💪👏👏👏👏👏👏
we need to tell Russian badger about this
My back is the cooked chiken after my comical as fuck friend says: *"i did not hit youbthat hard"*
should have seasoned them beforehand
This is such a perfect example of why I love the internet so much
“celsius is for real science” meanwhile kelvin just chillin there like ayo
Rark Mober
This guy is Zoomer Adam Savage.
Let him cook
Bro eats with a plastic knife and fork.  I have to eat with bark.
All jokes aside, with all the facts mentioned and all the technologies involved, if this is not to be considered a science - I don't know what is.
bro take "slap that chicks" to another level
Bro took beating his meat to another level 💀
You have way too much time on your hands.
that's a weird but interesting way of proving the laws of thermodynamics
Do beef so it more safe to eat
Fuck Celsius.  This experiment requires Freedom units only.
The only meal I'd make with a slap-cooked chicken is Chicken Cordon (Black and) Bleu.
Bro got a slap hammer 💀💀💀
For the steak I think it's damaging that he left the room to dump the juice. For the shitpost to be real you gotta mitigate doubt at all possible points
Meatbeater9001😂
talk about a slap up meal
Little did you know then that "vegetable oil" literally is motor oil lubricant.
so he puts his meat in his mouth after beating his meat?
I wish my hand allowed for adjustable slap depth...
Imagine getting slaughtered and then having your corpse cooked by a machine specifically built to slap you. That's one hell of an L
This is why white people shouldn't touch chicken.
The slap. what was his name? Will Smith?
1:05
better idea: arm the hand with a *gun.*
Harry Potter in chat at 2:50: ADD A FLESHLIGH TO IT NOW
Well I guess Russian badgers friend was right you can hit a chicken to cook it
rip off mark Rober lol
Bro litteraly beat his meat
Taking beating your meat to a whole another level...

You need some grade 8 bolts

Oh so this is what he ment when he said  "i can cook" 😐
Use grade 12 bolts. The black ones usually with a hex head. The best by far
How big would an ass has to be, and how hard would the force of the slap have to be, to keep the jiggle of the ass slap going from christmas to easter?
My guy got the Darwin award theme at 8:20
wasting time
That sounds like me at 3am
He said meat beater 😏
This is one of the greatest feats a YouTuber had ever pulled off
I'm a bit warey of the internal temp on that chicken
🤣🤣🤣🤣

Pure, unadulterated, genuine..NoNSense
He though he was mark rober😂
I slapped my chicken by cooking it.
Dedication 🔥🙏🏽
Missed opportunity to tie down the chicken with ropes and leather straps
He actually said “Meat Beater” in the beginning. I am dead…… 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️
Bro copied Mark Rober whole flow
"lets slap some meat" the wildness
Chicken cooked ❌ motor cooked ✅
Yes I would like my chicken slapped please
Alton brown would be proud.  He is diabolical and would have used this on cutthroat kitchen
I think that putting a chicken in the microwave is like, the most sanitary thing to do. PLUS, it doesn't have all the extra calories from the grease.
This was in my physics a level exam 😅
Mark Robert copycat channel
Congratulations, that’s quite a waste of time
Her Dad: What are your intentions with my daughter My brain: first 09:18  and then 09:37
You successfully slapped a chicken silly
I would never eat that shit
After meal: "That chicken was spanking good..."
me with the fine girl
So, you walk out the room at 9:40 to dump something and then walk back in with a steak...
Next Boil a sausage by fa-
Why did i see unskipable KFC advert when i click this video
*A Slap Battles players dream.*
Bro imagine someone does this to you 🥲💀
Impressive. Now slap that like button with the slapper.
Will Smith can cook that even faster!!😂
Meat beater 9000💀
I couldn’t focus after “ the original meat beater “
"Celsius is the temperature used for real science." Celsius: nearly half as precise as Fahrenheit
"You want to have dinner together tonight?" "Sure, but I gotta spank my chicken first."
Yo bro i think i accidently cooked my dick. What to do?
WAIT…what happened at 1:56?
6:39 Bruh missed a chance to say "it's time to beat my frigging meat"💀
You wonder what else this guy builds in his free time
*content*
what is this 💀
My girl’s booty must be well done by now then. 😳
Dawg beat the meat with no shit
This is the type of experiment the government fund with taxpayers money 😂😂
Show this to matpat
So, westerned down hill beating the food.  Destruction of race not far.
wtf is a celcius? like those energy drink thingys?
"Meat beater 3000"
This was literally a question in my physics exam
the next mark rober
Stone age people seeing this :
Wow! It is awesome to see such effort put into something so silly!
I didn’t even realize I watched this last year 😂
So if a pimp slaps his hos can he cook them
How many slaps per bird?  135K  I'm not gonna eat that.  If you're thinking of making a "beat your meat" joke, grow-up and grow a brain.  Snoop Dogg could have cooked it in one slap.
this guy took beating his meat to a whole new level
Here I lay at 3:10 am blunt in hand, watching a video about a man cooking a whole chicken by beating the crap out of it.
Why wouldn’t you season the chicken
all of this to just slap a dead chicken and cook it. 🫠
it’s 2am & i have class in 5 hours, but this takes priority
ultrasonic can cook beef too.
okay, I'll go on to heat the water with stones
Pooooor Chicken!!
Thank GOD the world has people like this gentleman. #KEEPonKEEPINGon!!!!!!
I have never seen a less appetizing looking chicken.
This is one of these videos that make me think you can literally find ANYTHING on the internet
im shocked youtube let you upload a video of you beating your meat lol good vid bro
Not the most efficient way to heat something up, but it does work on the wife too.
Vegans : Worse than Hitler
My man be spankin his meat in the garage
Def shoulda used the old looney tunes round of applause wheel. A conveyor belt with hands attached and a crank to spin the device
I can tell you watch a lot of Mark Rober because you talk just like him. 😂
It's incredible to me how long it takes "scientists" and "engineers" to fabricate their devices to withstand the physical loads being placed on them. That should be first on the list. Took way too many breaks.
I got to be careful next time I go demon
I want to see that chicken compete in Power Slap
You could easily be a voice actor
i hope davie504 had or will have a chance to taste it
Why ?  Dear God why?    Utterly stupid.
I can’t handle this kind of life hack. 🥲
🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔 idk about this
Davie 504 should see this... APPROVED
Next up is how many slaps it takes to burn a chicken
I can’t help but think of Mark Rober when I hear this music haha
Will Smith would be interested in purchasing this machine.
@TheRussianBadger  we figured it out, 135000 slaps.
Dude what?! 60 degree steak is charcoal!
if you live in America you go by F not C
New meaning of “beating the meat”
Enter this machine in Power Slap League please
I cooked my chicken once by slapping it too fast
So, you're telling me Will Smith needs to slap a chicken for 135,000 times to cook it?
I wanna cook a bird by slapping it
11:55  JD JD JD JD JD JD JD JD JD JD JD JD  XD
You don't need to worry about salmonela and bacterias because all of them were slapped til the death.
“The original meat beater” id like to have a word. 😂
You took beating the meat a little too serious Louis
imagine showing this to Gordon Ramsey
If Physical Energy can be converted into Thermal Energy, how hard would I have to punch a chicken in order to cook it?
Ok that was such a cocktease ending. How did we not see you eating a chicken from the goddamn slapper man I lowkey feel CHEATED
Chris Brown should market this, or Will Smith...or Dana White. Lotta slappers
I cook myself medium rare everytime I slap my chicken
Input I slapped my co-
My wife wishes she was the chicken.
Meat beater!?
The chicken looks a bit too pink don't you think???🤨
It seems that too cook chicken you need to cool down everything around - makes sense.
Homeless: I found raw chicken Also homeless:  starts slapping
9:22 nasi tu byli jebać disa kurwę orka pozdrawiam
60 degrees is cooked 🤢🤢🤢
I fast forwarded the video and was so confused when it was a steak 😂
And I ate a chicken by biting it.
The original meat beater😂
A: What did you eat? Grilled chicken, fried chicken? B: Slapped Chicken A: what the…
Davie504 slapps better.
Now overcook a chicken by slapping
wasted
The meat beater 9000...too funny.🤣
🥜🥜🥜
W
Bro thinks he’s Mark Rober
This hole video is freaking bizard. And the fact that O watched non-stop, is even worse.
Where is the slapper collaboration with davie504?
Ok, thats enough of internet for today.
I dream of the day when people in developing countries will have the same access and amount of resources (energy, food, and time) of a kid like this to experiment with alternatives for a better, simplier life for them and their families... Or of the day when highly privileged people will understand what #realitycheck should mean.
has guga seen this yet?
IT REAL
When you have all of the resources but none of the talent.
I see.....so all this time, men were just trying to eat booty
The design is very chicken
This is just another case of too much school you guys should use your brain for something better
If you ever want to slap a piece of do until it's done you can use celsius
You could have just used one of those scooter Motors with multiple articulating slappers also cooking is not a science it is an art so always use Fahrenheit
Cooking is an art not a science
Could have just made a slap wheel you big dummy
Haha, meat beater. Sounds funny 🤣
The fact that a chicken died for this.......man must be the proudest chicken in heaven
In 2100,  "How would you like your steak, Sir?"  "Slapped"
chicken: Finally, a sweet release of death, may my vessel returns to mothernature chicken: gets slapped into oblivion
it's 3 am here
It would probably be easier to just use a piston...but I guess it wouldn't be a slapper then.
2:19 KELVIN, THE SCALE FOR REAL SIENCE IS KELVIN
davie504 will approve this
Bro made a contract with the beat devil
I would like that machine slap my as… I mean chicken
Mom: Louis what are u doing Luis: im slapping my meat
Why were you so exited about a 60 degree chicken cooked by slap’s???Just why.
Can you cook eggs with friction alone?
Health inspector want to know your location
now this: "I cooked a chicken by touching it"
My bro used Adam Ragusea for his chicken cooking science... Nice!
Why not make a wheel with multiple arms….?
Memento Mori
I’m just saying, if kinetic energy can be converted into thermal energy, how hard would I have to punch a chicken to cook it?
Louis looks like Dream if he pursued a career in mechanical engineering instead of being a massive loser
Why not a steak, or ham
I don't like how he left the camera to poor to water out  He could of swoped stakes
Who let bro cook   Also the meat beater💀💀💀💀💀
Let him cook
HOW IS IT COOKED…
This is just a Ohio microwawe
So when my partner suggested slapping or choking my chicken more ...this is what she meant.
1:55 what the hell
Gordan Ramsay would like to know your location.
"sooo... What cooking method do you use for your chicken?"  "I slap it"  "What??"
Bro that is steak
Salmonella is waving
This makes me wonder if it's possible to ultrasonically cook a steak lol, it'd be insane if so
Weren't you the guy who was beating his meat in a Peter Sripol video?
came on here to fix an exhaust. Learned how to slap a chicken instead........
My right hand: Finally, a worthy opponent! Our battle will be legendary!
Steak is steak - A guy who likes Rare steak

Matt Pat will be so proud…
I have no idea why this ended up on my home page, but I’m here for the ride lol
EPIC
Yes
You are one of the few influencers to whom I would NOT tell to get a real job!
I would suggest putting a "no animals were harmed during the making of this video" but that would just be wrong.
I'm sure there is a huge market for a meat beater. But it wouldn't be used for cooking.
9:40 this dude just changed the bag lmao xD
He said the original meat beaters ayo
"How do you want your meat ?" "SLAPPED"
can anybody tell me how the background music @8:00 and onward is called? would sell my soul for it
"I beat my meat and ate what came out" is the correct title for that video.
8:24 is where he "chickens out"
We have learned how McDonald’s cooks their chicken
When I beat it that long I'm well done..
Did you really use the same song mark rober uses?
impressive, kinetic energy
"Man beats meat for thirteen consecutive minutes"
No schnitzel jokes, how disappointing.
“meat beater 9001 💀”
I bet your a hungarian and if you are gratulálok Lajos i think Louis is Lajos.
I cooked a chicken by slapping it, well I cooked an egg in a tree with leaves! and I um hee hee might have cooked a piece of cheese slapping it on the tree. Press F to pay respects to the tree
bro literally used the music from mark Robers videos
This video changed my life for the better, Thank you Louis.
why not just hire will smith to do it?
> go to kfc > faintly hear mysterious slaps > someone keeps bringing bags of snow
Mandem just spent 1 minute scientifically explaining slow cooking 😂
can you do one where you zap the chicken instead!
The Waffle house has found it's new host
congrats on eating a steak
the meat beater is over 9000
That ain’t holy
That ain’t holy
Eyo I need that machine for... Science... Purposes 👀
ive heard of being slapped silly but your already silly but the chicken was the one being slapped :D
Nooooo.... Im watching this while eating 🤢
The textures taste like shit but if you could get pass the shit tastes, it tastes pretty good 😆
This guy is Mark Rober but he slaps more
Am I the only one who recognised the song in the background at 00:57 is the same one Mark Rober uses
The original meat beater😂😂😂
Someone needs to send this to Davie504... Chicken with the power of slapp..
searched this up as a joke, didn’t think i would actually find a video :/
i bet the chicken enjoyed that
How about how many needles does it it take to cook a chicken by piercing it??
Meat beater 9001 and crazy 😂
Now that’s how you beat meat
Davie must love this
real real science (proper science) uses kelvin (0C=273.15 or 32F=273.15)
“Its time to slap some freakin meat” -louis, 6:39

1:55  Yeah this looks like  a interesti-   *This is my kingdom come*
This is why YouTube exists
hey man, no questions asked, quickly hand it over, ima need that
I was waiting the entire video for him to say fuck it and make the thing out of solid through-hardened steel with a repurposed F-15 engine.
How many slaps to to a fire ?
Vegans be like
Lol
"Richard, why is the chicken _extra salty_ ?"  *_"Honey... i can explain"_*

1:05  meat beater 💀
SLAPER DAPER SUPER CLAPER

Now try to melt iron with fans you get 300k tell (Mr beast)

Meat beater??🤔🤔🤔🤔
11:55 POLSKA GUROM
The whole time in sitting here thiking, why didn't you use a steel arm from the get go? It appears most of the mechanical failures were due to weak materials(wood and AL)
He’s got the mark rober bop
good god he did it again
This is a failed experiment.
7:27
The original meatbeater💀💀💀💀
Crazy!!
Next up, can you cook a chicken with the seat warmers from a car
Just get mark rober to do it for you

What the actual fu-
This is why we need depopulation
No one: Literally no one:                 Me on December 1st:

That is awesome Carl Leonard! You had some serious issues with fatigue on your rig. Some FEA simulation at the design stage could have really helped your design process 😁.
9:20 szacun na czacie hahahahahaha
You fucking madman
When u figure out how to cook without using gas
i’m glad he didnt name it “adjustable slap strength”
I cooked a chicken by slaping it pulls out  steak
How you did it😐😐
As someone who prefers their steak medium to medium rare... that steak is rare, hell thats rarer than rare, its basically raw.
bro is mark rober 0:57
Got hello fresh a couple times now and some of the food was rotten and meals were missing
not just the Toxic mess from the aerogel bag is concerning, also the time the chicken spent at ~30c, which speeds bacterial growth up a lot
I cooked a duck my sucking it
An innocent chicken died for this video. Go vegan.
All he needs not is to slow that thing down , attach a ....ya know never mind lol
Not speaking for me personally,  but the second you brought that bag off camera to dump juices, pretty much seals your fate in terms of this being non authentic....not me but you know the YT community...
Im so happy you did it in Celsius
1:56 🤨🤨🤨
He’s cutting STEAK with a plastic nife
Ayoo jhit said meat beater😂😂
Imagine inventing the chicken slapper in your room and your mom overhears you at the door.

Not what I was expecting when I googled "Meat Beater 9000" But I like it!
11:55 polish people look at the chat
It's kind of weird to listen to Mark Rober's soundtrack on a other YouTube ch!
What song is playing at 1:22
Humanity has really developed over the years
This, is the best.
What if try adding water?
this is how Davie504 cook every day
10:09 The slapper would beat the meat
is it just me or does he look like dream???  no offense btwww
Davie504 like this element.
Happy no nut November guys :)
epic
You should have used tow mater he would have cooked it
Why no Davie504 fans talking about the power of SLAP?
Don't sell this.     Someone's gonna put meat in there.  You know what I mean.
I thought it was chicken , turns out to be steak with sauce ,now people a days like to do clickbait
Hear me out. You get a box fan and remove the blades. Replace them with rods that have something on the end to efficiently slap the fine poultry. You make the blades go around and they slap the chicken very quickly. We have cooked something with a device meant for cooling.

Great vid as always Mark!

La comida se cocina x encima de los 100c°. Este video es falso.
JD
Others : Watchu doing this weekend Them : Beating our meat😂
Instructions unclear, Chicken strikes back.
That's not even cooked mate, Gordon would give you some compliments about that thing.
The only thing sadder than someone actually slapping a chicken is me actually taking my time to watch him do it
9:21 najlepszy moment, ngl
you can use any temperature scale 😂
For some reason I laugh hard when the machine slaps the chicken all the times when the act was performed
@the food theroists
what do you mean first? I cooked a chicken with slaps before you, without any tools. Actually, my whole family did it for years
Ain’t no way that’s a medium rare
Rule 1019 : you can cook a chicken by slapping it
didnt someone do this like 6 years ago or was that just the question and the theory
we need to get this thing to be added to slap battles roblox  with its name being ''da chicka slappa''
Imagine cooking a human ass by slapping it and then eating it
4:48 Bro i always thought you cook meat to make it tastier xD
Is it me or does he sound like MatPat
did he put any salt on that meat  oh wait what am i asking ofc not 🤣🤣
Bro shouts so much
Well...this video finally found me. Good job!
Take the mark rober music out and you've got some good content
real science is measured in Fahrenheit and Kelvin.  Celsius is just "ooo look 0 to 100 = water huehuehuehue duurrrr"
so, if u slap ur butt too much will make it cooked?
Is this dude Mr Beasts brother? He sounds identical
Getting some real Mark Robber vibes from these vids
I hear you need a meat beater...
Gordon Ramsay would be ashamed. But I'm proud.
This man takes the meat slapping on whole new level
This is truly the pinnicle of how technology has advanced
Me just hearing mark robert sound
q video d merda, começa fazendo galinha e termina com carne bovina kkk
ayo..
Did he not season the steak?!
Thumbnail : i did it (pic of perfectly cooked chicken)  Me after watching : See, now, that's some bullshit.
10:25 i thought he gonna says:" honestly, its taste like chicken" 😂
Fuck Celsius. It’s nonsense
this guy is stupid.... just sp stupid. cant believe he achieved this at all. dumb luck.
How would you like your chicken? Me: slapped
1:05 😏🤨
2:37 9 degree C? you know standard room temp is 27 degree right? did you beat up frozen chicken without melt it or something?? lmao or ur temp meter is just broken and u dont even realize it while shouting "YES its increase to 9 degree Celsius" hahaha
I stopped at "The original meat beater".....then I continued out of true interest
the world works in pretty cool ways tbh
It’s not a hand though. Is it still a slap?
Excuse me sir, would you like your steak tenderised?
This is so hilarious i had to sub.
This is kinda fucked up when you don’t consider this chicken food but a dead animal, bit weird to just fuck with a corpse like that. I know it’s just a chicken but it’s still a bit disrespectful
the right hand of the colonel
10:18 that’s what she said
the worst part is that almost every important discoverd thing is experimenting like this

you should've put the temperature in kelvins since this is a real science, nobody would be happy but it's for  the science
what did I just watched
ah yes, the USA is the only country who isnt communist. what shit lmao  2:19
is this markrober song
So much wastage of resources just to prove the stupid point.
New invention the "Slap Cook" Slap your food today at a low price of $15.99 with one of are free guides on how to slap those cheeks (A value of $69.00!) buy it now!
This is how meat beater expert looks like

Kinda Lokey crazy suggestion
This guy is the Davie504 in Science!
11:56 best moment in chat
This is going to change everything.
Seriously disrespecting an actual corpse right here.
That means ass can be cooked? Xd

"discord engineers" yeah the scientist
14.3 million people watched you cook a chicken by slapping it with a machine. I mean, what even is the internet?
How did I find this on my algorithms
9.26 coment secion  in polish
This is a ripoff.
This is what the internet was invented to do
Its just poor for what purpose the chickens died. It is a dumb idea, that shows that u got close to zero responsibility. There are other cool things u can build without damaging ethics.
Even though it’s cooked, the food looks incredibly unappetizing 🤮
He has turned beating meat into a science.
That was totally surveyed or cooked before it was put under that slapping machine
how the fuck did you miss the opportunity to say "this slaps"
I’m so glad this is measured in Celsius, Fahrenheit just doesn’t make sense
I was scrolling through youtube and accidentally clicked on this video... I guess this is how I would be spending my next 13 minutes....
Meat must be eaten . Well done.
I eat meat, but this video makes wanna go vegan - poor chichen :(.
Kelvin is the scale used for real science...kelvin...not C... it's just that people from across the pond, a stupid kids in the US think it's superior....when Farenheit is objectively a better way to measure temperature. Just like standard is just better than metric when building things.
el poder de la ingenierìa
3am content in its prime form
No country who uses Celsius has ever been to the moon

There is a tool name Cooker.. You can use it too.
New meaning to the term "beat your meat" lol
Ничего не понимаю, что он говорит?
What if we torcher person with slapper😈
So, you failed.
Anyone here because of that one Russian Badger clip lol?
The mask... Really!? Smgdfh yfp
Slap sous vide holy shit I’ve seen everything
Random guy: "so at what temperature and how long should i cook this chicken?" Louis: "hmmm 135.000 slaps should he good enough"
Just came off the slapper
9:21 XD Polish accent (chat)
he shoulda put a 2nd chicken on all the equipment that went up in smoke lol, waste of energy :P
I like it how it’s called “The Meat Beater” 😏
If you see this comment, I just want to say is I like chicken 🍗
But how many finger flicks would It take? Lol
wanna be Mark Robber
You need to use medium strength thread locker on the bolts so the viberation doesn’t loosen the bolts
BEAT MY MEAT 😂 😂 😂
I would say the food tastes slap!
nice idea to waste resources and time :))
Why why why why why why why why this
Game theory
"The original meat beater"
What if you just slap one chicken breast.
😡😤👎 ist müll verarsche
great, white boy didnt season it
"Im just sayin, if physical energy can be turned into thermal energy, how hard would i have to punch a chicken to cook it?" - jello
New definition to beating meat
How is it that I haven't seen a single person comment on him leaving the room with the bag of steak and juices, cutting the vid, then coming back with this properly cooked steak? Like... You gotta know there are gonna be skeptics, why would you do that if it was real?
He did it!  That crazy s.o.b. Did it!
the meat beater 💀you not slick
Imagine being that chicken, your whole life leading to this moment...
at this point just reinforce everything
Were beating the meet Broke the balls Yes, sure, I'm about what happened in this video
this video slaps
Tldw: no you cannot really cook a chicken by slapping it. However, you can cook a chicken by putting it into a defacto oven and then "slapping" the oven to convert the kinetic energy into heat and trapping it in the oven.  Nonetheless awesome video and thorough breakdown!
9:18 kurwe zwisa
There was a Slap-Chop so this seems like progress.
Mark rover vibes
You know serious engineering is afoot when Mark Rober's playlist starts going.
Can you imagine serving this and they asked you how you cooked it 😂
Mfw I recognise some of the background music from an 50 minute video essay about antisemitism featuring a woman pretending to be a man pretending to be a woman
This is basically what happens when my mom slaps the shit out of me.
Now finally we can find out how many slap does it take to cook human.
You missed 1 main formula - Will Smith hand size.
THERE WAS A FOLLOW UP VIDEO THAT I DIDNT KNOW ABOUT? WAT
@Davie504 Approved
Roberesqe with the music lol
Cool.
0:57 man fucking turned into Mark Rober
should’ve called thebackyardscientist to help lol
davie404 must learn this
POTRET MANUSIA KETIKA BELUM MENEMUKAN API
Normal people: Alright now to get your meat tender you have to slap it a bit Louis: BEAT THE MEAT, COOK THE MEAT. two birds with one stone .
When Guga is a engineer
This guy just watched TACTICAL FRIED CHICKEN from @TheRussianBadger  https://youtu.be/G-rMPc8JUnk
Gotta love a hot guy slapping his meat on YouTube.
:0
" Meat beater "
love how he fully says Fahrenheit, but abbreviates Celsius to C. Real America moment.
I can tell you're an engineer and not a chef because you called that rare ass steak a perfect medium rare
Your devotion to science is truly uplifting 👏 😅
Would you say the steak slaps?
Unus Annus, Unus Annus
9:20 polish chat be like
The segue into the Hello Fresh plug was worth watching the rest of the video for! 😂
"Since that's the scale used by real science"  ladies and gentlemen, conversion factors exist for a reason. Is it really science if you aren't using a conversion factor?
I thought we gave up on this a long time ago?
its like a mark rober project but…  stranger…..  much much stranger…
God, I hope you don't have downstairs neighbors
If you would slap water it would give consistant resistance
Now try punches!??!
you guys are so fucking funny
You can't really call it it's fully cooked without eating and have no repercussions
That guys is a mad man
and just like that “Slapping the Chicken “ was born
I feel bad for the chicken
KFC: “Write that down! Write that down!”
Should of seasoned the chicken before hand smh
Takes bite  Yo this slaps
Well done, i mean literally
Is he using the music that Mark Rober uses in his videos? just asking
I just appreciate that you did this
I'm a chef and your full of crap.
When you slow cook most meats (such as smoking it), it tends to "stall" for a while as it is hot enough to melt tendons and other fibers, and the moisture released cools the meat off. I suspect that is something you were running into.
Fact - the “meat beater” gave you nefarious ideas
High five... HUNDRED.
Maybe “choking the chicken” would be faster.
Looks like a job for Davie504
the fact that he saw the text on Twitter that says “if u slap a chicken 69,420 times it will actually get cooked    :edit pls like my comment
“Anything can be cooked, you just need to slap it hard enough.” -A wise man, probably.
From 0:57 he used Mark Rober's bgm.
Should have seasoned it.
now people in Africa dont have an excuse to not have cooked food every day
This guy beat his meat so hard he cooked it.
I heard it's theoratically possible to heat up a cup of coffee by shouting at it, challenge accepted?
1:00 mark is that u!?!?!
This man didn't stop at beating his meat raw, he truly beat his meat until it was thoroughly cooked
bro you walked off camera w/o 1st revealing the steak
*mark rober music* sus (its a joke) anyways, why do all science YTbers use this music
bro really just said meat beater 9000
ah yes the meat beater
Are you still alive pal? or salmonella got you?
My dude, I understand slapping a chicken ro cook it, but you could have also seasoned it a little. At least a little salt :P
quit screwing around
what's up SLAPPERS
peter is a tosspot
Wife: "oh no the gas prices are rising again, we need to be conservative" Husband: (purchases robotic arm from amazon)
died laughing when you cut to the chicken being slapped too hard
You hold your utensils like a 5 year old.
Why do I feel like slapped meat could actually become a commodity
alright mark rober calm down
I can't help but feel a rotary multi-slapper would have been more appropriate. Good effort though.
What if the chicken is kinky?
Shoulda put it between two slappers mounted on one arm to get double slaps
Yo congratz! This is awsome
if you like your chicken rare, very rare that is ... :)
wonky mark rober
I watched the complete video! fuck yeah!
Is this the same music that is in Mark Robber videos?
Wow how good is  this
Just like Momma used to make in the old country.
That's it. I'm officially insane.
Hello fresh is garbage. I used it and they gave me a recipe made by a stoner, and it was more expensive than going to the store and buying the ingredients.
My mom waking me up for school:
Somewhere out there when the kingdom want to use less energy to cook because lack of material, the king annaounce to the 13.500 citizens to slap cleaned chicken meat 10 times each person.
bro just use an oven
I'm ready to give my body up for science when I die but not for it to end up like these poor chicken.
Gordon Ramsey been silent ever since this came out…
Mark Rober would be of good assist
This is the pinnacle of western civilization...
And bones prolly
When did u realize steak doesn’t have bones
Bro, you can just put it to the oven.
Instead of doing this BC. I would be more happier to cook my chicken on the frying pan and enjoy it with some sprite😂😂. But nice to see the slapping experiment 😂
This video is sus :|...
The purpose of this video is just to entertain 😂
Midnight YT algorithm strikes again
The vacuum chamber idea would actually work. By lower atmospheric pressure you are able lower the boiling point of water. So with the set up and insulation you used you’d probably be able to reach a higher temperature at a faster rate.
RussianBadger and Geuce would have a blast
Unus annus
YouTube..hm

Davie504 approves
Can't understand it. Gonna have to redo the video with the proper system of measurement. I'm deaf and can't read words/numbers that pop up on screen. So I need to see the proper measurement on the thermometer.
The FDA needs to update their guidelines to define how many slaps it takes to pasteurize chicken. I'm pretty sure that somewhere around 5,000 slaps you disintegrated every possible life form that may have been in there.
This madman really beat his meat till it was cooked
Can’t believe I just watched a 13 minute video on slapping chicken to cook it. I’ve seen it all
My right hand is also a meatbeater 9001 lol
2am algorithm sure is different
So often I think, I hate YouTube so much and then I come across something like this. Thank you so much for this madness
Chicken: spends its entire life standing in a cage crowded with feces and other chickens to ultimately give its life and body to nourish us  Us:
Imagine there was a more intellgent civilization in the earth than us and they were farming us as a food source. Imagine someone kill you and slap your body 100.000 times so hard that your body reaches 60 degrees. and than after he eates a bites from you he says you are not even that bad and throw the rest of your body to trash. that is what happened to these chickens and we have all had to witness it.
I like to slap my chicken too.  Or choke it.
its raw
in old times nomads put the meat piece for drying under the saddle. its like a similliar effect.
I would like to purchase a slapper to use on Donald Trump please 🙏
I can cook her meat to 60°c with just one slap.
09:21 szef
Rest in peace to the chicken that had to sacrifice his body to this
Wtf
What a tool.
This video makes me question wether YouTube should have never been invented
30 sec ka video ko 13 min ka kheech diya 😂😂😂
This experiment whatsoever doesn't contribute to the Human society. It is extremely uneconomical and only for entertainment purpose. 😂, Always stick to your traditional way of cooking
Are you serious about the "Guns save lives" sticker?
So basically you're beating meat until it causes a fire. This is me at 3am with no lotion.
slapping that like to increase the cooking power of his chicken
Good vid man but promoting undercooking your chicken doesnt sit with me
Chicken cooked to 130…uhhhh
Somewhere in parallel universe:  Louis: WE are gonna try to cook meat using fire
Rip the 3 chickens and cow used in the video
Neighborhood says that what the power of the guy hour of hard work 🤣😂🤣 sllap slap babe 😂😂😂😂
The fact he said meat beaters is just 😂😂😂
imagine if cows made a machine that slaps us until medium rare
Does it means if someone slap their own 🍑 over and over it'll be a cooked 🍑?
I would've thought choking the chicken would be a better method as it creates friction naturally 😏
Just gotta say, Fahrenheit is much more precise, and only people that can’t keep up with it and need simplification need Celsius.
An animal with dreams and aspirations died for this
So how hard would you have to punch a chicken to cook it?
I COMPLETELY misread the title and thought it said "I choked a chicken by slapping it"
It’s easier to cook the chicken from the heat out of the motor and the transformer
Bro I still can't even cook one with an oven💀
yes its called a "meat beater" what about it
How?
i want to put my balls in this slap machine
I hear ovens work pretty nice
Why pander to European viewers? I don't get it. Use F, and put a conversion on screen for those insufferable douchebags if they won't shut up about it.
Lmao
2:20 actually Kelvin [K°] is the official SI-Unit for Temperature
Poor chicken died for this
now that's rather undignified to all those animals right?
so my pc could cook some chick too? like 70° celcius while gaming
Meat beater 9000
Celsius may be easier than Fahrenheit, maybe that’s why y’all have never been to the moon. You took the easy way out.
Isn't that Mark Rover's background music? Anyways, don't know who used it first or if it's actually common. But, i just noted that
A slap up meal 🤔

Why get hellofresh when you can slap a chicken
How isn't this possible?
Dude has everything except an vaccum machine for his sou vide Steak
So this is where all the virgins meet huh
wtf did i get recommended :D
you cook your meat to kill bacteria. i cook meat to make it taste better and easier to chew. we are not the same.
I watch ASMR on this account……..and I’m not disappointed that I randomly came across this.
Man took “beat your meat” to a different level.
Will Smith should try this
2 15secs ads….this must worth a looooot!
That chicken is definitely not cooked
I like to imagine an America where the jackhammering cacophany of the robot arm smacking the turkey was part of the ambiance of every Thanksgiving dinner, right along with the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade and the delicious smell of pumpkin pie.  JUST A FEW MORE SLAPS AND IT'LL BE READY, Mom screams over the deafening roar into the living room.  And of course, everyone has that story of when they were young, and they wanted to touch the meatbag that was being pummeled under the furious blows of the Meat Beater. Hoh Hoh! Never tried THAT again!
You should try choking it 😂
This guy could legitimately help us colonize an exoplanet... yet he is cooking a whole chicken with the kinetic energy of slaps. Humanity is wonderful sometimes.
I watch one Mark Rober video and now youtube is recommending fkn Smart Beavis over here. Can't wait for the next 500 RIP offs
But can you cook it by choking the chicken?
Now, can you cook one by choking it? I sure hope not.
literally had a heating element in the arm.. not impressive. you know youd trick alot of people too who dont watch the whole thing from the beginning.
Why does this guy sound like mr beast but has roberts spirit
I wonder if a chicken would cook if will smith slapped it
Hell yes! I watched the original and this is the best conclusion I could have hoped for
All that for a beat up raw chicken
Some slap for cooking, and some for fancy tests. But machines that slap for pleasure are machines that I love best.
You should do a how many chokes it takes to cook a chicken next video.
Am I the only one who noticed, and this is only the sneaker head in me talking, that this man is wearing $6k shoes while slapping a chicken to perfection?
I remember watching this livestream
Laaame you didn’t eat the “cooked”chicken. Doesn’t count
This feels like the experiments the US government would use tax money to conduct. Lol
Vegans seeing this video: 💀
Who the hell needs Mars? We here cooking chicken with slaps.

I love the tie in to the sponsor
Just need to throw it on the grill for a crust haha
The next I want to see a chicken cooked with a Russian MLRS flame-throwing thermobaric system Solncepek(Sunheat). Pweeeeeese.....
Yes! Torture that dead animals bodies in the most random way possible!
why dont u try save the world instead of useless stuff like this?....
Can you slap My ass and  cook it?
Now I have to think twice when I beat my meat.
No wonder I'm soft all the time... I'm constantly slapping my meat.
needs a few more slaps
Could the chicken be choked instead?
Tenderdizing and cooking at the same time. A smart way to save time.
This is true YT content.
So this is what jerry seinfeld is doing these days... mad respect
*When you are a professional builder but you have no oven*
13:36 waste of my time.
That’s insane, someone show this to Gordon Ramsay he needs to see this
Man literally beat his meat to cook his chicken
should have put a bunch of slapers on a wheel and spun it up. Would have hit faster more often and been less force on your rig
This is what YouTube was created for.
Yea Mr Weisz!  SCIENCE
"If thermal energy can be turned into kinetic energy, how hard do I need to punch a chicken to cook it?"
Yeah I could never be a mechanical engineer.
So many people want to save the world and fix climate. They want it so bad that they’ll even fight space exploration saying its fractional cost should be put to use on earth instead. But cmon, almost 14 million views says that humans are hypocrites and just want engineers to solve the chicken slap cook equation.
now...what does this prove again?
Chicken ghost in chicken heaven like 😲😲
the steak is more like medium or medium done
CAP HE SWITCHED IT WHEN HE WENT TO THE BATHROOM nah I’m jk 😂😂
🤢 but I can’t stop watching
If nothing else, you proved that the theory was solid. If you can slap it enough times and contain the heat, with enough slaps, you could get it as hot as you need it to be. It’s just a matter of getting the right equipment and controlling the impact of the slaps.
This was pretty underwhelming.... That chicken did not look cooked at all.
This guy took beat your meat to a whole other level
This video slaps

Now to see how long it takes to cook a chicken by slapping it by hand.
In near future: How would you like your chicken cooked sir?  Stove top curry, oven roasted, deep oil fried, air fried, grilled, rotisserie, or slapped?
Thats not a chicken
I want one of these for my kitchen, where can I get one?
Finally. My meat beating skills will pay off.
Can I borrow this thing? For…science…
I imagined a dinosaur king dreaming of your video million years ago. Witnessing the Destiny of his kin at the hand of a supposed pray must have been a horror
YOU did not cook a chicken because YOU were not slapping it. click bait bs
It does hurt to chicken?
Why's it dark all around when it's not slapped all around?
ТЕХНОДЕБИЛУСЫ!!!
So you mix rice with your hands

Cooking chicken requires 135000 slaps. Took a note.
Just call Will Smith and it would be done in 1 hour
The meat beater 9,001 …… 🤤
Imagine being picked by a farmer to be killed, and you get sold to a guy who slaps your corpse until it’s cooked
I absolutely loved every second of this video
Guga would be proud... Now lez do it!
“Who’s your daddy?”
Just beat it
Now this is what I call beating meat!🤤
This is the kind of videos that internet was made for
Should’ve been measured in kelvin not Celsius if were being honest
is this mattcolbo's brother?
When he said it’s 2:50am it was exactly 2:50am for me
this is more pounding a chicken than slapping.
^^
I fucking love humanity 🤣
My guy hacksmith from wish
The steak didn't count because you heated it before you started slapping, hence why it looked like a normally cooked steak, because you heated it normally first.  Weird that it surprises you ...
People got too much time and disposable income on their hands in the West bruh.😂😂😂  I love the ingenuity though.
Man, humanity is an interesting species indeed.  Such ingenuity just to cook a chicken by slapping it.
The Mark Rober music is epic
well....taste aside, at least it was tenderized...
I watched till the end and realized this was pretty much all for a commercial 😒…
The forbidden what it would be in "anime version"
"This is the meat beater 9000". using your hand is like using the 2000 edition.
I stopped at 1:20.  This is too stupid to continue.  May the fleas of ten thousand camels infest your armpits!!!!
ThE PlAstiC KnIfe tho
The Reccomendation Algorithm strikes again!
no!
I'm convinced, going to throw away my sous-vide for a meat beater 9001.
I assume the "how many slaps does it take to cook a chicken?" is a colloquialusm where you live?
Bro 60°c have fun with that food poisoning.
Dude, that's some real cooking right there!
The ads for this video were so inappropriate. YouTube seriously needs to do something about that
WHAT'S THE NAME OF THE SONG IN THE BACKGROUND???
OUT OF CONTEXT : I had a dior add before that... seriously
I reckon if you'd put a torch or any flame to the steak, it'd be absolutely bang on. Nice video, Louis mate.
Ngl just put the chicken on the overheating machine and probably cooks it faster lol
"meat beater" is crazy ngl
This man has done more work for single video than any other youtuber I have ever seen... Respect to you man...
Petition for these to be installed in kitchens worldwide for humorous kitchen gags for family and friends.
Instead of using an electromotor, why dont you use a turbine?

I just watched a guy slapping his chicken
When you celebrate your chicken is 60 degrees and don't realise that it needs to be around 75 degrees to cook it ;-)
So is nobody gonna question 1:55
Next time try rubbing the meat.
Never thought I'd watch a man beat his meat...
Just like Jello asked “I am just saying, if kinetic energy an be converted to thermal energy, how hard do i need to punch a chicken to cook it?” For curious people, it is in a RussianBadger video, an old World of Tanks video
Person: *Makes steak using unconventional method.* Guga: *ARISES FROM HIS SARCOPHAGUS MADE FROM A DRY AGER.*
the chicken slaps start at 6:45
Pretend dump the liquid and switch the steak
You should always joke your chicken before slapping it. Gosh.
Is that laser guy related to you
Copped out, still cool
Waste of time and energy.  Also, chicken was raw.
Am I the only one who can here mike rober music?
I always found that choking the chicken makes it quite tender
In case 8:46 👌💕

So this is how Will Smith eats.
This man’s dedication to making the perfect chicken slapping machine is unparalleled. I’m just upset in a year too late seeing it.
He sounds like Marty mcfly
(Going to a restaurant) -Hi! I would like to order the chicken filet, please. (Kitchen staff shows up and talk to the waiter) -Huh... Something happened, we're out of bottled gas, the cylinders are empty... And there's no firewood to use the wood oven.  Waiter: -No problem. (Looks at you) Well, don't worry sir. You'll get your filet in no time.  Waiter and staff head to the kitchen.  (Background noises): [SLAP SLAP SLAP SLAP SLAP SLAP SLAP SLAP SLAP]  Minutes later...  Waiter: -Here's your chicken filet, sir.
I have a question. How does merely slapping a chicken raise its temp????? Does the kinetic energy somehow turns into heat energy??????????
Some kids get spanked so much you would think they would have rump roast.
If you cook chicken breast that way it's called slappy white meat.
So do they jerk chicken to make jerk chicken.
If you are here elosantoni
couldn't you just make a rotary slapper with multiple flexible paddles that that impact the target while the unit spins ? it could impact less hard but more often.
I like how you compared the energy consumption to a conventional oven 🤣
As a cook, you get more precision measuring in Fahrenheit but whatever.
When he tasted it, I thought he was ganna say "yo...this slaps"
Interesting what YT recommends at 3 AM
man that chicken had better days
Came off the slapper 💀
The music and they way he forms sentences and delivers information make it feel like this is mark robers odd cousin
Is your life so boring you have to cook chicken all day by slapping it?
That meat beater needs a lot of lube.
Is this why my schlong is burning?
i wouldnt eat it
Should've been in Fahrenheit
Slappers slap like now
This should be a standard appliance in every kitchen!
It looks really bad

I always dream of slapping something with so much force that it explodes

I don't get what's so hard about portioning out your own food. It's not hard. I know how much I and the 2 people I feed will eat and we RARELY have left overs or excess. It's not difficult when U KNOW HOW MUCH FOOD YOULL EAT AT ANY GIVEN MEAL.
This is true science
a wheel with 4 soft hands that slap but not hit, 4 slaps per rotation, since it is just turning you might have less damage in the machine. lol.
The chicken in the heaven watch its body get slapped million times
I can sleep easier tonight knowing this decades old problem has finally been solved.
WTF!
Perfect medium rare: 🐄
Some wise chinese man once probably said, if you cant cook em, beat em
This is lord of the rings level determination😂😂😂
This guy be stealing Mark Robers theme song, watta wanna be
Yeah, on a grill, I prefer lower flame longer period. Gets a nice deep cook, and the smoke gets absorbed better. Then you can hit up a lil char on the way out, before you get them bad boys off the grill. And it's just money
Kush, te quiero. ◇

Did he just changed the meat idk sounds fishy when he took it to remove liquid
What if we punish people with this thing 🤔
Kind of sad an animal died for this
ну и ху йнёй страдаете
@Davie504 would love it
Meat beater device detected
Guys this is a wake-up call!  Don't slap your gfs ass too much/fast or else you will cook her. Turning her into juicy chicken. 😳
Bees cook wasps by slapping them with their wings
Wow this is a real thing..  I wonder you will try to heat the meat with swearing/insulting.  People can get heat up ...maybe meat too..
that is insane!
This slaps
Well, here we go boys.. another way of beating meat...
Her: "He's probably thinking about other women..." Him: "I wonder how many slaps would it take to cook a chicken..."
Peak of humanity.....we’re watching a guy slap cook a chicken,,..and it’s kinda glorious.
2:20 > used for real science I mean you’re not totally wrong (Kelvin scale is based on Celsius scale) but I laughed hard
When can I get this on the shopping channel?!?
I need one of these for my kitchen.
Noice!
So we need science to make ordinary things as complicated as possible))))
Unus annus is fucking freaking out rn
Sorry you’re wrong, there were other chickens cooked by the power of slaps, my camera just broke so I wasn’t able to upload mine
So by the logic of 135-140 for at least an hour being considered as bacteria free as 165 does that mean I can sous vide my chicken to 140 for an hour and be good to go?
Best idea ever
bro, i seriously thought he was colinfurze at first xD he sounded just like him in a build things channel .-. cant blame me
No bacteria can resist this amount of slaps 😂
Let's try to cook some eggs!
I did not know steak came from a chicken. I guess I learn something new every day:)
Dude took "beating the meat" too seriously!
Thats why I thought why did it look like petter garbage but it is it
Can't believe this got recommended to me lol
9:21  poland in chat XDDD
This idea is so trash that I feel obliged to subscribe to the channel
I've been slapping my meat for damn near 30 years now and still isn't cooked. If anything, it just gets more raw🤣🤣🤣🤣
I would have made a rotating wheel with many slappers, this way you could have more then one slap per rotation.
Bro should have gotten a bunch of those massagers you press and it goes back and forth really fast. I bet a bunch of those secured together would cook that quick af. The settings are ridiculous.
The temperature measure for real REAL science is Kelvin.
1:56 Ayo🤨📸
You know what they say beating meat is actually a complex feat
So theoretically, if you beat your meat long enough, could cook it?
Damn, that chicken really destroys machines.
I need this as for the soup because of my god not eating the chicken when pealing the meat is painfull
I admire your insane dedication to slapping chickens.
1:07 where can I buy one of those meat beaters...I'm asking for a....m-me me I'm asking for me
I wonder how many slaps it would take to deep fry a McNugget. For scientific purposes of course
It has been done.
“The meat slapper”
F
would a spit roast be feasible with the slapping technique?
Davie504 likes this video
Just realised Iam watching a dead body get slaped.
Some time in future this would improved and be fully functional and i wish to live until that
Thanks for wasting my time bro, mad respect 4 u ❤️❤️
1:05 😂
i wanna see you and guga foods collaborate on slapping a brisket
Unus annus people biting at the bit rn
"If I hit chicken strong enough,                   will it cook?" - Me
This is how spontaneous combustion happens, when people beat their meat. 😔
Meat-beater 😂😂😂
No for how many slaps does it take to turn an alive chicken into a rotisserie chicken
This is the spiritual successor to micheal reeves
you sound like mark rober a little to much
12:41 oh u eat rice, cool 12:42 oh hey, that meat sauce looks 12:43 okay... it's weird but I can take it (cause I like corrot 12:44 hey, wait... 12:45 wtf is that white sauce, u ruined the rice and meat sauce!!!!
dude think better
69420
kind of amazing that this could be the fate of some little creature haha...
I don’t think power plants will be using this method for energy transfer anytime soon
You made a spanking machine 🤣😹
That chicken went through hella beating
If he had told Will Smith to do this, it would’ve been a lot easier
Dude. You can't recognize the value of the metric system, then go and use SAE hardware. Get some metric nuts and bolts in your life.   SAE hardware is worse than measuring temp in Fakenheit
It's...    RAW!!!
A certain Guy with a BASS would be proud off your slapping technique.
Why did you keep insisting on making it out of wood? Like you could have made it really robust if it had been made in metal?
Actually Kelvin is the temp used for real science 😂
Jesus Christ is Lord and King and Our Savior!!
lmaoo 2:47 "beat the meat"
Thought he was gonna cook the steak, but that shit was still mooing-
Ah ma non è @Luis Sal?
You Sous vide it first? That’s some bs
Hi
He swapped it out in the bathroom
Why didn’t you just use a wheel with strips of leather or something to continuously slap it? Lmao
2:15 No, it's just the scale that the entire world uses. I just don't know why USA keep using other scales...
Get rid of the Celsius lmao u live in America with an American audience.. idk why you would change it
"Meat Beater"
meat beat mania final boss
thats one way to get tender meat
That chicken is nooot cooked bro. looks nasty and raw af
This is what our ancestors did before they discovered fire.
slap battle
Should add seasoning for a better flavour next time
Now am alive chicken
Your Mark rober at this point
What the hell was the purpose of this?
Waiter: "Would you like your chicken blackened or fried?" This guy: "Is it possible to get it slapped?" Waiter: "Dafuq?"
Can we make it simplier by the slapper attached to a Tire? So one tire can have 4 slappers. We can move the tire using vanbelt and motors. The friction will be on the slapper and not the motor mechanism.
It would've worked first try if you used Fahrenheit
I want my steak slapped medium rare
Now That's a Slapper
0:06 "unfortunately this video was sponsored by Hello Fresh"
found this video,i wonder if u can cook a chicken by cps
Missed opportunity to say that it slaps (even if it didn’t but still)
how the chicken feeling about this 😥
why
Hey! No! Bad! Don't beat your meat!
Why wasn't the slapper two-sided so it see-saws and cooks a second chicken on the other side?
I've choked a chicken many times.
he slapping chicken meat, I slapping subscribe button

Beating meat until it’s hot

That is the definition of intertainment.
No salmonella was harmed in the making of this
Davey504 would definetly rate this slapping instrument
you should get these many slaps
before: obviously this is clickbait, but there must be something scientific in there anyway"  literally 5 seconds in: Holy shit he's being serious this man is a genius
It takes a lot of energy from waves passing through the chicken to create the cellular friction to cook it. It will take a long time unless the frequency of the waves are short, the WAVES would have to be MICRO. This is a megawave cooker. Maybe soundwaves or radio waves will cook it.
friend thought you were going to slap it manually LMAO
This guy took "beat that meat" to the next level.
Thatveganteacher watching this:
I went to target with my mom a while ago, and an employee randomly came up to her and started telling her about this video. I don't know why, and it was very weird, but I also kind of respect it.
8:17 My right arm is a meat beater 9000 💪🏽🍆
Celsius is the thermal measurement for science? Kelvin would like a word.
ayo?
this video is stupid... but i love it.
Creating a new method of cooking is no small feat. Congrats.
did i just watch a horror show made for vegans ?
Imagine asking this guy what he does with a $30000 degree in engineering and he just presents this video
9:19 na czacie jest coś fajnego spodoba się dla każdego polaka :)
Wtf is this
65C my dude. 65 is where you keep food at a buffet. 75C for cooked meat and ensure salmonella doesn't survive. 95C takes care of frigo- Meso and thermophile bacteria. Earth bacteria is also killed at this temperature.
Y dosent this guy have 1mil
how this idiocy has 13 million views is beyond me.
*AYO-*
Video should be like.... What if humans never discovered fire??????

I didn’t care…but after a few if your videos…suddenly I did. Thanks for the journey I never intended to take.👍
Walked off camera with the steak and then pulled out a cooked steak.  Nice try 😂
I’m on holidays, so this is the time where I’m just relaxing and finding random videos In the recommend, I do not regret coming here😂
Man being chad
I’m shocked. This once was a living and feeling being. Don’t you think you lost it?
This guys just explained why cooking product at 10000 C for 1 minute can cook it
Hmmmm beating meat to cook it . I wonder can you choke you're chicken to cook it ?
@9:28 "YES THE STEAK IS DONE"
did you season the steak
Sometimes the progress reach humankind in an odd way
I cooked some bacon by telling it dirty jokes.
my dirty mind XD
Haha i love the internet sometimes now i can say i have rly seen a chicken get Done with slaps. 😂
Is this mark robers brother or something? The way your talking and everything sounds awfully familiar.
Guy took beating my meat to the next level..
Meat Beater a useful tool for parents and thr slap happy
Where can I buy one of those meat beaters? Asking for a friend.
gas prices go up everyone be like:
yes this was on my recemended
the will smith method
Right, but how hard would you have to slap a chicken once to cook it?
Madness lives here
Meat beater 🤔
Davie504 must see this.
Fk Celsius. The real temperature of science is Kelvin
I am going to show this to my dad before my exam result so he takes it easy on me
This man actually beat meat 🤣😂
bro what
Kalos Malakas.
This is huge leap for humanity
This is huge leap for humanity
@Davie504 would be proud.
you should try ham next
bootleg mark rober
This is another level of "BEATING MY MEAT" lmaooo
At that broken rate and your persistence. You shouldve build ten of these beaters from the start and finish off the experiment
Let me question something do you know where you will go after you die? If not let me say you can have a choice to either go to hell or heaven see 2000 years ago there was this man named Jesus who died on the cross for our sins and rose alive 3 days later all because he truly loved us he died for us so I question you now do you truly believe in Jesus or do you live for the world turn to Jesus Christ trust in him Christ has way much more to give than the world he loves us turn to Christ!
Huh... So that's why my wife constantly has unexplained fevers. Well, I guess they are explained now.

What a way to make Youtube special again! This is why we are here!
Yoooo I finally get the closer. I got recommended that first video near when it came out, completely forgot, then I almost thought this was that video again but I checked and I'm glad I did because wow you actually did it.
lapping is how I kept my hands clean form the C .... When no soap around HEAT it up .. Slap those hands.
I showed this vid to my wife and now she want to replicate this slapping machine at home. I don't get why because we have electric ovens, gas and coal 🙁 and i explained to her that this method would be a waste of time and energy. But she still insists and i don't get the reason 🙄
old as time? CAP
Mark rober but immature

thanks man I was getting hungry
I'm sorry but Davie already cook spagheti with SLAP 👋
Switched the meat when walking off camera

Hey! When I was in secondary school, there was an interesting joke to shake a bottle of water so fast that it produce heat to boil the water.  Okay...seems legit!!
This is stupidly funny
Meat beater...

Would definitely prefer hello fresh as its delicious af, but still impressed by the slapper.

Ah yes more YouTube content. I need more of these and we enjoy this.

So, thats how we did not got extinct by food poisoning for out first 100.000 years
And this is pointless when we have fire
Man casually slips in the phrase "the original meat beater". What a chad.
Achieving where mythbusters failed
"I feel like this could explode at any second." *immediately puts face 6 inches from it*
How did you kill the chicken -  by choking it?
Bro your steak looked like how I try to cook mine every Fucking time it was beautiful
My chicken i glued on my butt after a whoophing from my dad: Pathetic.
Speed has EVERYTHING to do with it.  The speed of the bottom informs the top how much pressure he's supposed to apply.  Speed's the name of the game, right?
Therussianbadger would be proud
Impossible, perhaps the archives are incomplete.
Why didn’t he season the chicken?
Must have been super tender …
The meat was good. Since you cut it with plastic knife.... hard cheap meat would not accept plastic... no no.
Wait a secod he went to pour ot thriller juice right mybe he put cooked stake while he was doing that
I'll stick to choking my chicken...thanks 🤪
pov: "your mom after see's your browser history"
Thats why slapping the wife to cook faster is the more efficient use of slapping
Everytime i slap my chicken, its always well done in 2mins..
The real way of measuring the temperature in science is kelvin
isnt the real science temperature is kelvin
When beating your meat turns to cooking your meat. Lethal stuff.
When it comes to beating your meat, this guy is a professional.
Let's gooooooo. To the grocery store I need to buy milk. Let's goooooooo to the vet my dog needs to get neutered. Let's gooooooo to the mechanic my car needs an oil change.

1:03 a meat beater will always have a fundamental problem.
Fire lol
Rip this mans wallet after his electricity bill
no chickens were hurt in the making of this video
Shout out to how to basic
Lmao.. this the future🤣
Absolute legend
So… you cooked a steak with a sous vide cooker. Then, you slapped it for a bit, took it off camera _telling_ us that it ”looks cooked in there” and came back, definitely with the same steak. You claim to have cooked steak, but it smells fishy.
nice marks sience music lk
lol.... just lol....
IDK why this was suggested to me but I like it!
Davie504 will love this!
Chicken don’t hit back - BRUCE Lee probably

Pretty cool project. I do think it's hilarious that you opted to use the exaxt same royalty free music as a very famous "engineering" youtuber. Anyway, still a pretty cool video
I get mark rober vibes
Master chicken slapper.
Use the power of slap battles on the chicken
Davie504 enters the chat....
You know shit gets serious when the Mark Rober music starts!

+13 mio views. I guess Idiocrazy was not a fictional movie.
I made a milkshake by slapping it but there wasn't much left in the bowl after... and the wife said to never do that again. 😕
God.
wut
nice
'it feels kind of soft' 'tastes like you have already chewed it for a minute' yeah no shit it got slapped 34 thousand times
I would have said a spinning wheel with paddles sticking off of it would be better. Use flexible flaps to soften the blows...?
Can i use my wife beater 9000 to get the same effect?
All of hear is mark robers music...
Will smith would be amazing chef 😂
I know it's not the point, but I can't help but point out that you'd probably be better off just putting the chicken on the slap motor and cooking it that way.
Why qouldnt you do with steak so could actually eat
Its realy got slaped👋🍗
it was still rare
Simultaneous campylobacter salmonella???
it beats meat fast
Wait so is this more or less efficient than a normal stove or oven? (Energy useage)
i will subscribe if you cook a fish with it
I thought that the official science temperature scale was kelvin...

He beat the neat
Gordon Ramsay would say it's fucking raw
This takes slap battles on a whole new level
Mom: WHY DID YOU TEXT YOUR GF THAT YOUR BETING YOUR MEAT? Me: No mom, im  beating  the meat
11:54 chat xD
Ok next time let’s cook meat by slapping it cooking meat by slapping it
bruh meat beater 💀
So i just need 34384 slaps to cook a steak.Useful survival tip.
My guy has the ultimate slapping machine and uses it to slap dead chickens instead of human butts
Chimken is happy about this
my hand would be pork if my brother slapped me
Am I the only one remembering the "how hard would I need to punch a chicken to cook it" joke from one of theRussianBadger's videos?
Anybody watching this do not do this under any circumstances you will get salmonella poisoning and you will get very sick period this is in no way shape or form cooked or edible
that steak is more tender then wagyu

I skipped ahead toward the end of the video to see the results. Which means I also unknowingly skipped the part where he switches the chicken for steak. You can imagine my shock and confusion when he opens the bag and pulls out a rare steak instead of a cooked chicken.
Yoo this new recipe is fire!
That’s Peter sripols room
Why do I get this recommend?

Fun fact: if you slap the chicken at over 1665m/s you can cook it on one slap
Can you guys even Imagine it? I searched for this and it was totally a random thought at 3 a.m....!!
3:33 NO!!
3:28 important milestone
Why wear you wearing a mask
And that's a slap folks. Until next time keep slapping lol
This man is littearly mark rober but faster content,
Louis weisz is a rip-off Mark Robey
This is how cave man used to cook chicken back in their days all they do is slapping the chicken for 69420 hours straight
mark rober on a budget
Has Gordon Ramsay seen this?
you did it!!!
I send this video to every vegan i know and don't regret a single thing
I hope to one day live in a future where this guy patents the meat beater 9001 and it becomes a household appliance
Maybe use steel parts and increase power. Old engineering trick of using more metal.
Meat beater 9000🤤
“what oven do you have” this guy
Truly a new definition to beating your meat.
Who's here after seeing a post on Instagram...?
Dude how about there's a slap machine under the steel object and try to cook a egg on it
“The MEAT Beater”.

Bruh, did he really just take his steak into the bathroom? O.o
“Slapping your meat like that you should be ashamed young man.”
I would've wanted that steak to reach 80c but aight
lol
You got me hook line and sinker with that video title. Slapping a chicken.
That plateau you hit with the steak, I am pretty sure is the same phenomenon that is the bane of every pit master's existence smoking large cuts of meat.  I can't be positive because you had it in a heat-retentive bag (where in a smoker, you would wrap it in foil or butcher's paper), but the basic principle is that heat loss from the meat is the same rate as heat transfer into the meat, otherwise known as The Stall.
Can I have all the ladies slap my chicken?😂🤣👐👐
He mentions it takes longer to kill bacteria at 60c but he immediately turns off the slapper once it reaches 60c
Wife: what are you watching  Me who has been watching a chicken getting slapped 250,000 times
Try cooking with a paint shaker machine
Should of marinated the bag
Standing here
oui
I think you forgot to calculate the fact that the machine is heating up, and the heat is dissipating through it…so technically the friction from the center part is cooking the steak.
Not the mark river music 💀
It tastes like you were slapped
how much money did you boys spend on poultry
Where cooked chicken?
You sound like game theory
I think if the chicken Can speak he would say"yamete kudasai"
Pfft, that's nothin man, I heard Chuck Norris cooked the last supper with one roundhouse kick. Don't quote me on that it MIGHT be a rumor.
“ my cracked team of discord engineers”

who is here from 2022 EDEXCEL Physics paper 3?
I showed this video to my physics teacher a while ago and lo and behold it was a fucking question in my a level physics paper 3. So thanks for informing the back then
Apparently this was a question on an a level physics test recently
Just letting you know, I just did my Physics Edexcel A level exam and one of the questions was about cooking a chicken why slapping it. Gorgeous question.
Thanks for the help! I was thinking about purchasing a meat slapper, but after watching this video, I chose a grill instead!
https://youtu.be/G-rMPc8JUnk I bet he seen this video
You also like cow meat? Nice beef is nice so is steak
I can’t believe this chicken died for this
We accidentally pasted a link for this video in our master's thesis report... But hey, we got a good grade.
Me when im home alone
Give it to Davie504 he's  gonna slap it hot in now time
Hehe... Meat beater mans talking abt me
Your like jame sidis but the lite one lol.If u know who's 5his person
9:21 XD ten czat
so.. it's a hot spanking machine.
Jebać Dissa
"the reason we cook our food is to kill bacteria" actually, not the only one. Maillard reactions improve flavor and tenderize meat, as well a simple boiling also make too hard to eat roots and vegetables edible. Some foods also need to be cooked to not be poisonous (manioc, I m looking at you) etc etc etc
Now chicken tomorrow beans, u should try cooking beans
Celsius for science, but Fahrenheit for cooking... just saying.
I read in the comment: BEAT MY CHICKEN
lol coocked in a slapper but the chicken doesn't slap
Did i miss something or the chicken turned to beef with all the slapping.
9:20 POLSKA GUROM XDD
I didn't even know this was a saying or a thing....?
He's lying. This video is sponsered by Patton
Yeah, we used to burn each other with bic pens. We'd rub them on the desk and then press to the back of our friend's neck.
your mark rober 2.0
I'm new here The machine and experiment is amazing But voice is so annoying, and dude screaming like non stop at the end of video
Gordon Ramsay will slap the sh!t out of you!!!
The BLOWIE-MATRON, i was shouting it out and never expected you to say it (i mean why would you 😅) .. i was so happy when i heard you say it.
You said it smelled nasty…where is the seasoning!
In conclusion that chicken was still raw and uncooked.
my man made a spinoff called slap vide
I to "Jebać Disa" w 9:21
So nephew nick slaps his meat to preheat
Someones gotta do it.
Okay, but where is the smoke on it???
“Adjusting the speed  is an issue because it means we’re forced to slap the CHICKEN harder and harder””what we need is a ring that is really really fast but not that hard” “the meat beater 9000 ran smoothly”
So how would this be with ground beef? Would the texture be benefited by the added slapping or would it still be worse?
I love this new wife-beater 9001
i'm curious if having a heated slapper would better simulate a hand. Perhaps since the hand is already a source of heat, it may take fewer slaps. I can imagine the engineering nightmare though of keeping the surface of the paddle at 98.6 F.
If humans didn't discover fire
He really “beat” that meat.
How Will Smith cooks his chicken:
Meat beater 😂😂😂😂
Will Smith would be proud!
I was smiling all the time until I saw the plastic cutlery :-D
Celcius og Kelvin, never the f word for temperature. never. ever. no
Thanks for using celcius. Only dumb people use  F°
Meanwhile somewhere in the universe where human kind is just food for aliens: "Yo, I want to cook this human with my slap machine" 👽
can you try cooking a chicken while slapping it next?
I don't get it.
Wait, is it actually possible that you can cook meat just by beating that. Years of efforts of my mine was just in vain ?
Youtube algorithm is sick af
The Bible says that no one is a good person. We have all broken God's law the 10 commandments, we have all committed, lies, adultery, idolatry, and blasphemy. We deserve hell, but because of what Jesus did on the cross we can be forgiven. So if you Repent of your sins, change your wicked ways, and put your faith in Christ you will be written in the book of life. 👌 🙏Repentance is reviewing one's actions and feeling contrition or regret for past wrongs, which is accompanied by commitment to and actual actions that show and prove a change for the better

#uselessyoutubeengineering
Take my subscription
Imagine doing it manually 💀
See what you actually have to do is have the chicken talk s*** about Jada Pinkett...
Just think about what the chicken in the afterlife is thinking
Imagine being his neighbor, and you wake up at 2 am hearing the sounds of chicken being slapped
It's one of the most impractical ways of cooking food, but optional.
Make ist With a subwoofer
Slapping sous vide 😂
Well, I said you just needed more resources!
Imagine Will Smith slapping that chicken, it would be cooked at 30 minutes LOL
SKJSGBUJNHSBUHHSUGGSHY I GOT AN AD FOR AN OVEN BEFORE THE VIDEO LOLOLOLOL
saw peter sirpol in the video
Stop bro. Don’t use the fucking mark rober music. Find your own dude.
...Chefs hate him 🤣🤣
this brings a whole new meaning to "beating the meat"
Gordon Ramsay gotta see this
who's here after watching action lab's video ??
The meat beater 9001. Yes, we all got it xd
why did i remember this video existed and come back to watch it again
if you cconnect the rod nearer to the center of the motor, It will be faster
That is the first time I saw someone cook a steak almost perfectly medium rare and it wasn't even a chef or a professional cooking method
How Asian parents cook food:
A momentous occasion to cook a steak with a slapper... And it's on a paper plate with plastic cutlery. Dude.
The chickens parents after watching this on the dark web: 👁👄👁
I’d never in my life eat meat medium rare😷🙅🏻‍♂️all my meet gotta be well done I don’t play that shit..eating medium rare how y’all get tape worms an all that other bs
Something from wallace and Gromet XDDD
....for The Rock. I did it for the people.
The future of food is *VIOLENCE*
The most tenderized meat ever
2:15 Not true. Celcius is not the scale used for real science, Kelvin is.
Can't this be due to a hot metal arm, from the transfer of heat from the motor and friction with the joint pin, instead of the slaps?.
I just figured out why I never have to cook my sausages
Davie504 Want to know your location
I'd like the vid a lot more if you'd just shut up and not make those soy faces.
Me hearing the mark rober music in the video: oh boy this is serious He using celsius: OMG ITS REALLY GONNA HAPPEN
This is the dumbest thing I've ever seen.  It's awesome.
Putting engineers on YouTube was the best decision ever 😂
This is how davie504 cooks all his food
So theoretically I can cook my butt with slaps?
This is the most Mark Roper thing I’ve ever seen lol
It's like a chicken Davie504 would cook
*Everyone gangsta until the chicken slaps back*
Would it be possible to boil water by stirring it extremely fast then?
That steak actually looked decent
It’s alive! It’s alive! It’s alive! It’s alive!
This video has more views than Swedens population💀
I always eat chicken on extreme rare yes all chicken
put a fleshlight on the end of that thing and go to town
I thought it was busted
This chicken hits different
**DISCLAIMER**  No chickens were harmed during the making of this video.
slapping the salmonella to hell
Waiter: "Would you like your chicken smoked, grilled, or fried, sir?" Me: "I think I'll have it slapped, please."
Took you longer then needed. Just get the chicken to say wills wife and he will cook it in one slap.
I told my boyfriend I was watching a YouTube video of a chicken getting slapped... I don't know if I'm single now...? 👀🤷‍♀️
With the bag wouldn't the chicken be cooked at least in part by convection and not by the slap?
Jesus loves you and died on a cross and rose three days later taking our place and paying our debt (for the wages of sin is death) so you can have eternal life and be forgiven of sin if you repent and pick up your cross and follow him daily
I don't get it how he got a cooperation with hello fresh on that video
Waiter: Grilled, smoked, seared?   Me: Slapped.
who the fuck eats chicken at 60C minimum temp for chicken is 75C... goodluck on getting sick mate
Or... You just... Can... Cook it normal way.
That's nothing, I can slap my chicken way faster than that!
Times are changing
I was the sub who took you from 666k to 667k... so I unsubed... it just didn't seem right!
So basically the texture of the steak was like it was tenderized with pickaxes for 3 days straight.
Gotta get me one of them meatbeaters
This is the peak of human evolution
somewhere here is a will smith meme to be had i'll start ''perhaps will was just trying to warm up chris rock''
Cool! :) Should put there only fillet...no bones ;)
I choked a chicken once....by choking it.
My father was an engineer, his father was an engineer, my maternal grandfather was an engineer and his brother was an engineer, my sisters boyfriend is an engineer, my uncle is an engineer, one of my cousins is an engineer, I'm studying engineering.  I like pretending someone in my family cooked a big hunk of meat by beating it endlessly for ~3 hours . . . I mean, my father was making $800K a year, so maybe it was him . . . Nahhhh, he was an EE.
You need a shock absorber....ain't lieing....
Actually, Kelvin is used for real science
congrats you spent 12 dollars in electricity to  eat a 7 $ chicken   you didn't accomplish anything but  hurting  your wallet
I want to cook your face the same way you cooked the chicken
It’s like a fuc machine doh
Standing here I realize You were just like me Trying to make history But who’s to judge The right from wrong When our guard is down I think we’ll both agree That violence Breeds violence But in the end it has to be this way
Impossible. If this were true I would have your mom well done by now
Please don't eat the raw chicken.
This takes the term "beating your meat" to a whole new level.
why do you kind of look like onision
This is the first time watching this, and out side of the cost. My question is why didnt you use metal instead of wood?
69420 😏
This is why I fell in love youtube in the beginning.
Really hot chicken in your area
It's like to forge a sword.
Meat beater 9001
Disgusting
Hell yeah, he finally did it!
Beating your meat on another level.
waiter: what is your order sir?  me: slapping cooked chicken
Ok, so here's what you need to do: hire at least 100-200 karate masters who have the advantage of both a powerful slap and extensive nerve damage from years of slapping practice. Have them all form four lines on the north, south, east, and west sides of the chicken. Then, each karate master will take turns, counter clockwise, slapping the chicken once before retreating to the back of their line. This will give each karate master a short respite to allow their hand to recover and keep them from becoming fatigued. Meanwhile, there is no reason the chicken has to remain stationary, so wrapping it tightly in a vacuum sealed bag and putting it on some kind of rotisserie will ensure an even cook, and will presumably help trap the heat inside as you'll be warming the entire surface of the chicken at once instead of heating only the top. Now, I know what you're thinking: How do I afford to pay 100-200 karate masters to work for an indefinite amount of time? You don't, you donut. Gordon Ramsay does because this is the dish that you will present to him after becoming a participant on his very own show: Hell's Kitchen. You don't have to win the show. You just have to cook the chicken.
Slap ass!
I would wanna see a video of vegans reacting to this lol
F
When u go over to your white friend’s house to eat.
Celsius is far less precise than Fahrenheit.....its also lame and fascist. Way to allow your science to become group think --- thats weak sauce.
Why does this video make me so happy
Slappys on the chicken! 🤘🛹
Fahrenheit is far better than Celsius. Losers of war use Celsius! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Will Smith would burnt the shi* out of that chicken with one slap.
The fastest hand on Wild West
This should come in handy one day.
will smith would be proud
Considering the chicken was kept for several hours at room temperature, then at body temperature, in unsterilised home-made machinery, I would really not try to fudge it when it comes to minimal pasteurization requirements.
Woke up, planned to not waste my day off. 15min later i'm watching a video how to cook meat by slapping it. There is something wrong with me...
I thought you were cooking chicken. How did you get steak
Elon musk should hire you to come up with solutions in any of his companies
Fahrenheit is the proper measurement for real science
This is how you make Trump Steaks 🥩
I've never seen someone so enthusiastic about beating meat.
I think maybe slapping it parallel to the grain might help reduce the bad texture on the steak? Not sure, but kaybe
The factory workers put that smoke in the motor with a lot of care. Try to keep it in next time please.
The fact you actually tried the taste, subbed.
you work In peter shreple's work shop?
"Meat beater 9000"
slapping a meat allow to make it tender with onion or glutamate rich food it's even better
Is cheaper to cook a chicken with an oven
temp for real science is measured in Kelvin not Celsius 😂
a legend
It would only take 1 slap from my mom if the chicken forget to defrost itself.
LMAO...Okay, I have a question for you. How many slaps does it take to cook a ham or Turkey ?
Well if anyone has kids forget about the belt use these
How tenderized was it?
I HEAR THAT MARK ROBER MUSIC!
real science uses kelvin, not Celcius or Fahrenheit
Teacher showed us this today, so cool!
La brigada in Argentina makes steaks you can cut with a spoon.  You should have tested the steak like that
One day in a physics classroom in the far future. "Class as you all know, vibrational energy application was discovered when a man asked himself one faithful day...how many slaps would it take to cook a bird?"
Set it up in a rotisserie then slap!!🐔🐣✋
It's better to slap your chicken than choke it I suppose.
How many vape puffs to smoke a ham?
I came here hoping to see 13 minutes and 16 seconds of a hand slapping a chicken. I feel let down.😔
How did you not go blind?
I want prechewed food.
He just beaten his meat lol
2 years later, Louis opens a chain of restaurants called "Meat-beaters; We beat your Meat!" only to fail when he attracts the wrong type of customer.
6:25 he's using a recifier. So does that mean he is converting DC back into AC?
Maybe chicken should be the next challenge on _Beat_ Bobby Flay...
Chicken is a fuck around and find out food. The absolute sickest I've ever been in my life was from undercooked chicken. I thought it was going to kill me.
BRILLIANT!
THATS NO WAY TO TREAT A CHICKEN , YOU SUPPOSED TO CHOKE IT FIRST .
Imagine I was hit that amount of times.
Lol
Celsius is gay.
(Hello this is George from 2022) Will Smith will be proud of this
It would have been awesome if he would’ve said “you know this kind of slaps” when tasting the steak 😂😂😂😂
9:21 mielonka mielona co robi kurde kto z Polski ten wiem o co biega

Now, I could make the forbidden joke that may have crossed everyones minds, but I'll spare you my terrible punnery
The Original Meat Beater
oh no 11:55 chat
Did anyone ever suggest a slapping wheel
- how do you like your chicken, sir? - Slapped, please
I don't know if I would want to beat my meat with this machine.
Just as long as you didn't choke the chicken!
"I am gonna slap you *SO* hard it will cook the meat off you're face."
Well, it turns out Louis Pasteur was a plagiarist and impostor. You just needed to make the chicken taste good, not kill any of the potential microscopic vultures called bacteria. You know, since vultures or bacteria only show up when things like animals or cells die (i.e. cell damage is the disease and bacteria is the response). Bacteria cleans up what your body can't evacuate through normal excretion such as going to the potty, sweating, bleeding, exhaling, sneezing, coughing, etc. Being worried about bacteria is like worrying that maggots might kill your dog. They will eat your dog, yes, but only if it dies in the woods first.
"i cant nibble this!" haha I'm gonna use that
Give it something like a layer of chain mail so it doesn't bust open!
you should have used Will Smith
Imagine if the caveman invented this instead of stoves
imagine the potential, with a fleshlight
me  a moron trying to understand how a slap generates heat
Who’d predict that tenderizing the meat WOULDN’T make a superior steak?
Slap that chick
This is like a bonus scene from Idiocracy
POV: The Vegan Teacher watches this 💀☠️💀
I just found out about this and seeing the fisrt video fail was so sad but this was epic it made me so happy and impressed seeing that it actually worked you are truely a madlad
Middle aged woman asks how she got here and what's up with the algorithm.  Also watched until the end... interesting machine Epic name...
I think this wins as the most elaborate setup for a slew of "spank the monkey" jokes where here by "spank" I mean "slap" and by "monkey" I mean "chicken".  Well done!
Get this guy on the daily show. Except he probably already has more views.
You should use a turkey and have a real "slapsgiving"! (got it?)
This man is the binging with babish of William osman
Why am I here but also, yes.
this video should be fine instead of much needed sleep at 1am.
Super good restaurant idea!
didn't expect to learn food stuff in a chicken slapping video but that bit about the lower temperature working as long as you cook it long enough will stay in my brain forever
One of the best comebacks
You could have a vessel or bag with 2 objects in it.  1 chicken and 1 other object, the other object could be something that when hit creates a lot of friction theoretically holding the heat energy and next to the object or in the same chamber / bag  the chicken that doesnt get beaten to a pulp.
You know, I just got done watching How It's Actually Made: Bread and in that episode a portion cutting machine was referred to as a "Batter Bitch Slapper." This shall be dubbed the Poultry Bitch Slapper. Let's try this with other meat, like turkey or duck.
Completely ridiculous
Thats crazy lol Cool video
I would like to purchase one for my mother in law.
Congratulations dudes!
The amount of money and energy created to perform the work is way too high. Coefficient of performance is high it will be difficult to sell your machine, as well as the chicken. Nice experiment though.
dosent seems cooked well !!💀💀💀💀
13 minutes of meat beatin'
1922: we’ll have flying cars in the future  2022: *slapping chicken*
Everyone on December 1st
this is a lie. Nice  cutaway when you reveal the meat.

11:55 spoko nie ma za co
Meat beater rofl
This is what happens when people take jokes too seriously Great video btw 😎👍
Math time: In order to cook the chicken by throw it from a great height, what's the minimum distance required?
Well this makes the choice easier between coals or propane.
You have given me inspiration to create my own meatbeater
Don't talk about slapping your chicken in public, come on, show a little decorum.
a spring absorber set up on the striking end would greatly extend the life of the unit.
Okay, guys. I think this video is the one which attracts me more. Imagine, slapping that chicken non stop until it is cooked enough to be eaten............ In business prospect, this method is wasting time. But, for people who have nothing to do, I think it is a good idea to waste time besides helping the people who really need our help, like the orphanage, poor widows who cannot afford food, abandoned old parents by their children, and a lot of more.
You literally made an invention to cook sonething in the most tedious way…Im out of words and my respect
Someone please tell him that there is something called an oven
don’t let will smith find out about this video….
Something about the title doesn't sit right with me.
Careful Simone Giertz may build a robot to take out the competition.   Congrats. 😎
It would take less time if you choke it. 😂😂😂😂😂
Stop copying @MARK ROBER
Wait...    you could run it on steam.
I just realized, something is wrong with us humans when we began spending so much time watching this king of trash content instead of investing it learning something useful or at least spend it with our family… just saying.  By the time I watch this… it’s about 296 years if we multiply the amount of views and the minutes this crap lasts.
how cigköfte was made
Most chickens fo eaten are cocks,,,
I got a KFC add...
why do it simple when u can do more complicated
So when did you cook a chicken? Click bait?
what a huge waste of time
so pumped for this vid, i watched the original vid and was sad you couldn’t eat that chicken
"Beat my meat" just got a completely new meaning
This boy needs some life goals.
The texture is pretty bad and it tastes like you've been chewing it for 20 minutes is because its raw you dummy ...
wait...so when in Romania ocassionaly we get 40-45 in city center during summer for a few days... Does that mean people that grow chicken in their back yard will have their chicken cooked alive? We have walking cooked chicken? wtf?!! talkin about Hot Chicks..
This guy is mark rober 2.0 and uses the same music when he’s explaining things

"Slapability"
It's not actually cooked
This is the new cooking show by Will Smith
who's your favorite little rascal? alfalfa....or spaaankkyyy?
Why didn’t you use a slap wheel design?
Nappa: "Vegeta! What does the scouter say about his slapping level?" Vegeta: ~crushes scouter, inhales deeply~  Memes aside, have you considered turning the whole apparatus sideways to 90 degrees and make it a training machine for the Slap Fighting Championships?Some finetuning and these guys could use that little bugger to sensitize to slaps with varying degrees of strength.
This, THIS is why the internet exists!!! 😂
Who comes up with these ideas? Not in a million years i would've thought to do this!
That chicken must be really proud for   the purpose of  its death
Celsius is for people who can't get to the moon.
69,420 slaps in, somewhere in the world Davie "approved".
ideal for people who can't cook :D
I bet you choked the chicken by spanking the monkey.
Ridiculously crazy but genius 🤩👍🏻
You have alot of free time on your hands don't you!   LOL
This is literally a spanked chicken
just shove it into the damn air fryer
Bro all you have to do is change the attachment on the business end, and the meat beater 9001 can live up to its name in a very different way.
Sorry , this looks like beating instead of slapping,  maybe you should use a flexible arm, and spin it , after slapping the chicken, it will retract and make another turn and slap again,  current set up looks like have a lot of energy work back to the motor and the wheel , if the chicken is hard
2000 years in the future, History channel show about internet archaeologist:   "after years of combing through the ancient server farms of San Francisco we found a video that we think shows how humans in the early 21st century cooked their food, they used a kind of mechanical machine that hit or "slapped" the food. It was not until the invention of what they called the "air fryer" did they discover convection heat, many of these early humans where confused by how to use the "air fryer" and relied on monthly food subscription services that would teach them how to use this primitive cooking device by mailing them the ingredients and instructions on how to use the "air fryer"."
That was pretty impressive. Good move in switching to steak instead of eating that chicken. Steak Tartar won't kill you, raw chicken will.
That animation tho boom 🤣.... what happen is the bolt got very hot and week then it melt off... but boom 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
The Will Smith Chicken Cooker...that's the next George Foreman Grill!
To many steps skipped in the cooking process. i think ur getting a good start.. but u failed and u kinda forced a victory lol. but great content dude.
You weezled out on that definition of "cooked" really get that temp up their
True carnivores eat meat raw, dude
You don't slap your chicken, you slap your monkey and choke your chicken.
what did the vegans say ?
When Science could cure cancer or even end hunger no were doing more important things we are going to slap a chicken in till it is cooked this is the future
Your problem was the steak was you forgot to season it.
Guess you could say this video was *well done*
It took me about 10 minutes to realize I was watching an informercial for the MB 9001.
use a bass speaker and crank it up!!!
How Will Smith cooks his chicken
Chicken Slapper. Now there's a real hero.
Its tenderized to
How many slaps does it take to cook my wife’s ass?
HOW CAN SHE SLAP
"The original meat beater" No son, that’s definitely not the "original one", but I’m sure it can be used for something…..
I do not believe, how long you slapped at 60 c?
Will Smith cooking machine way better than a George Forman grill.
Neighbours, "what's that noise", " just old mate next door slapping the chicken" 😳
Please tell me you seasoned it first
How many slaps would it take to cook a human baby?
That chicken must've told a joke about someone's wife that she didn't like 😳
You’ve just invented a new porn category! 🤣🤣
That's the fucking stupidest thing I've ever seen in my life... No shit...
And was Chris rock cooked by a slap?
This is how humans assert dominance over other species on earth
Man watching this makes me want chicken
"sooo if kinetic energy can be converted into thermal energy, how hard will i need to punch a chicken to cook it ?"  i think we got our answer bois
Lol 😆   OMG
Sir. You are my hero
who the fuck is considering doing this XD why did you even do this lol
Up next: cooking a chicken on orbital reentry.
You guys would have solved the pandemic in an afternoon.
Cooker and tenderizer, all in one.🤣
Dude, chicken is cooked when its cooked. Undercooked chicken is nasty. Thats the real science.🥴
Wouldn't it be nice if you can create the kinetic energy and not destroy the meat at the same time?
Just put the damn chicken in the oven !
okay so.... idea... do the steak again.... but season it in the bag before you wrap it up and beat tf outta it xD. oh and.... maybe securing the rig would help?
No joke but right as the slap counter hit 69420 my power went out
I don't know why this was in my recommended but I enjoyed every minute of it
The company, selling those chickens, must be like stonks after this experiment
Real dedication
I know a particular meme slap bassist that would approve this video. 👌🏽
Someone give this man a slice of Ukraine!
He gave the term “meat beater” a whole new definition
Try cooking your chicken by choking it sometime.
Use a stronger motor
How about use a stronger motor
This will replace microwaves everywhere.
pre chewed food
One thing I learn from your videos is "if you don't give up, you will eventually get it for sure". Well done. 👏
My one question is how many chickens did you brutally ripped to pieces
Dude salt and pepper,, for the steak,, salt will help more ways than one
There is also different types of aluminum,, always use hardened grade structural ,,, it tends to polish rather than ware,,, and has a higher working temp👍👍
Always use grade 8, bolts,, the head should be stamped,, 3 hash marks is grade 5,   5 marks is grade 8,,, totaly different than an average bolt🤘🤘
You know, aliens watch us and will decide what to do with us.
You should’ve said it slaps 10:42
I hope Food theory would see this because one its episodes is can you cook a chicken by slapping it lol
The Celsius temperature scale is only used by stupid people.
there is something called a oven
The most tender meat you’ll ever consume
Oscars turkey
This is what true science is about. Take a theory and prove it with practice (Atleast try to prove it).
you should slap some ham
You have earned your official degree in poultry science
Raise your hand if this made you think of TheRussianBadger.
Me too chicken, me too
This guy is dollar store mark rober
Add more slappers for faster cooking
8:18 The way he said:  this is Meat beater9001, truly pushed to the limits......he made me laugh like crazy.
And that, is why science is hard, but amazing. These vids were all clucking hilarious.
Mark Rober music belike
Kelvin is the superior temperature though
The chicken is probably happy to be out of its misery BECUASE being slapped at like 10 times per millisecond  is probably not  a good feeling at all.
Will Smith can cook your chicken for you
Will Smith has entered the chat.
the legend of that chicken
the design would have been more reliable and simpler if you designed it like a piston engine and crankshaft.

I’m watching this at 6:00 am
*consciously avoids saying "beating my  meat" throughout the whole video* Pretty impressive mate
Wait until the vegan teacher finds this video.
me looking for Will Smith comments 👀
you have WAY too much freaking time on your hands.
Couldn’t you at least season it so It’s worth eating?
1:05 Original meat beater?! One sec*Srays antisus spray*there😁 the original slapinator
hmm i hear this sound all the time from my parents bedroom
I cannot believe this was a year ago
What has become of my recommended
What am I watching :3
you should get around 1,000 people to slap a chicken by hand.
Parent's: ah yes nice tool for our son
5:05 we also cook foods to denature certain proteins and change their chemical make up to make it more efficient to digest.

But is hello fresh food fun to watch someone make?
the mark rober song
lol
2:20 Shouldn’t you be using Kelvin if it’s for scientific purposes though? For anything where more than the change in temperature matters, Cecius won’t work. Got to be *extra* scientific about it
If kinetic energy can be turned into thermal energy the question i ask is, how hard would i have to hit a chicken to cook it. -grouse from the russianbadger
the engineer
The absolute pinnacle of british engineering.
I never enjoyed a mad lad beating his meat, as much as in this video
so how much did this experiment cost in total?
can u do it on another chicken and then record yourself eating it after its been slapped?
This is the new stove for chickens
Hmm maybe you could “double dip” on the slipper by making it also slap down on the upstroke
No cap straight slaps
That mosik is mock rovr
So no seasoning 🤦🏽‍♂️
I forget who exactly said this but it was in a Russianbadger video where they asked this exact question and now we know you can cook a chicken by slapping it
The tacit yak oppositely harass because bath conversly stretch including a spiritual rocket. unkempt, wiggly rhinoceros

Hey, what do you do for a living? Louis: ...
The man fucking did it.
for the steak use the meat beater on the outside and the finger tingler on the inside
El pollo: UwU
I remember this was 1 month ago now it's 1 Year.
Mark rober?
why is the music the same are mark robers
Can you cook with sound. Because sound makes atoms move so it can cook right?
THE MEAT BEATER 9000 IM DEAD
Does anyone remember the Unus Annus video on this where just gave up on slapping it and started throwing it off of the roof
Eww pink meat (the steak) so gross meat should be well done only both for health and taste reasons
New way to "beat your meat"
Chicken paji is dying nooooo!
Never let the magic smoke escape.
You have too much moving mass. And you are losing half your energy on the upward movement. How about a wheel with flexible metal flaps that keep slapping the chicken and then bend away? It should be much more stable construction, it should use less energy more efficiently, and the chicken should be less pulverized
1 YEAR ANNIVERSARY BABY, LESGOOOOOOOO
I love the @MarkRober music in the background
Imagine the chicken watching its body after being dead Seeing it's body getting constantly slapped
stopped as soon as u lowered the standards, technically dont work for me
the chicken that sacrificed its life for this be like: why are we here? just to suffer.
What impressed me more was the f*ckng steak rather than the chicken, YOOOOO, YOU COOKED COW M E A T, THAT'S ACTUALLY SUPER IMPRESSIVE.
Is the background music royalty free? I feel like I always hear it in engineerung videos
That’s for a chicken breast or chicken sign out a whole chicken each have different cook times
Básicamente es lo que hace el microondas.
I guess Louis just likes clapping cheeks
"The meat beater 9001"

Anytime I can order meat that's been beaten, it's a special day!
Slapping a chicken is like the inefficient induction cooking.

Someone get NASA to hire this man and his crack using team of discord engineers. Astronauts can have slapped steak in space!
When you hit the plateau, it was because of the stall, it's a normal process of cooking beef, especially when  you cook it slow. Meat cooking isn't Linear. :)

So you cook a steak by beating the shit out of it, and you have the audacity to humiliate it by eating it with plastic fork&knife
This is like a sped up version of those Russian slapping contests.
Did you get inspiration from Badger
I typically hate sponsored videos, but this partnership was *chef's kiss*
9:21 na czacie prawdziwy polak xddddd
need to get with guga for some help on the cooking haha
Celsius is a joke.  Use Kelvin.
Ayy
"Cook the chicken in the oven for 20 minutes at 70º, or use the slapper for 8 hours".
I think you should name this "Connor Machine"
Just use a cast iron pan on a Phoenix sidewalk.
THis is why I oay for my internet.
could've bamboozled them all by using kelvin
Vine por el canal date un short
Asian parents: my time has come
Just learned there was a sequel to the first video
I normally would skip to the end of these types of videos but I had to watch the whole thing. This was too much science to not watch.
Next video: Can u cook a chicken with a hairdryer
but How many Watts would it take to cook a chicken?
THIS IS AMAZING
not sure how I got here, but I'm happy I did
Hi
https://youtu.be/A1kMgaQ2gG8
Hmmm Can it beat ANY meat?
I wish he had seasoned the chicken
you should add a buffer spring to absorb some of the force and make the machine last longer
Imagine a chicken watching this and his mom says o look son it’s grandpa the first chicken ever cooked by slaps 🐓+✋=🍗
I'm surprised the chicken survived. I'd expect the chicken to be slapped to an unrecognizable goo before it was cooked.
JToH
Quem veio pelo vídeo do Felipe guisoli? Kkkkkk
Freaking blood was going out of the steak when he ate it
what
LOLLL LOOKS LIKE DINUGUAN HAHAHAH IF HE KEPT THE BLOOD IT WOULDA JUST BEEN DISCOUNT DINUGUAN
If only you used your powers for good
I think it would have worked out better to let it 'cook' at the desired temperature. Just because you reached the temperature you desired does not mean it was cooked in the slightest. You could have gotten very sick!
Carne mal.passada é gostoso, mas é perigoso pegar solitária(taenia saginata)
why cant this guy have as much subscribers as mark rober
Quick suggestion: So you know how when you rub your hands together they get hot and if our hands were fast enough we could cook our hands… my point is you should rub the chicken instead of slapping it to create heat but it has to be at the right speed because we want it to cook but not to be overcooked or be undercooked.
This is how modern people cook their food if our ancestors didn't discover the Fire
If Parents got a hold of that they would probably rename it to the child ass whooper 10000
You cook chicken to kill bacteria, what you mean im sure you can’t eat chicken raw
NOW try cook chicken by hugeing
We we so so focused on if we could we never stoped to think if we should
The real temperature used in science is Kelvin.
Next time try cooking your meat by beating it, give your meat a good old rub 🤣🤣
2:30 Celsius is NOT the system of real science because it isnt even base 12. Europeans are so self-righteous. If they traveled the world, theyd see that nobody really uses one system of measurement in most measurement systems. And nor should they, being polyglot in terms of measurement is better than knowing one system. Especially since incrementation (unlike on paper) matters in practical application in real life. Sometimes you have to measure something to the nearest millimeter, or other times, 1/16 of an inch or the quality of the product will go down or equipment will experience too much wear and tear, etc. Despite the measurements being eeirly close to each other. In fact, people get so weird about linear measurements not being in base 10 which is weird, Because sometimes....it is measured in base 10. So according to the metric people, theres nothing wrong with imperial since it literally is used in industrial settings as base 2 fractional or as base 10

Jebać disa : 9:21
Davie504 would be proud
i have no idea why i am watching this
Davie will cook it with a single slap.
I know what I'm doing with my boys next time we go camping!
I mean, the obvious next step is to put a Hello Fresh meal in the slapper.
Mum: *"Pathetic."*
“The original meat beater” 💀💀💀☝🏽
It should be called the tenderiser
Dont let @davie504 see this video
Louis: Slaps a chicken  Davie504: *breathes heavily*
What a time to be alive
when you know that you falied, but... ahora la bebes o la derramas!
Davie504 after seeing this : *WISE CHOICE*
my fav part 4:08
i hope he seasoned it at leasr
1:04 ...meat beater ill see myself out 🚶🏾‍♂️
So he wasn't able to cook the chicken in the end
so this chiken did die just to get slapt
Remember guys, don't beat the meat too much
Why not just use ultrasonics to cook the chicken?
The meat beater 9000, or as i like to call it "my hand greased with some lotion"
Eat a meal cooked by the power of slaps.  *famous last words*
>slap chicken  >gets steak  win win
Automated meat beater! 🍖 this needs to go on shark tank
What a trash and lies
Someone please show Davie504 this.
I’m surprised I don’t see any RussionBadger references here…
9:35 is what you were looking for
Omg I know about hello fresh from a rucking business lesson in school we had a case study on it
This video was useless but I still enjoyed it. Thank you
I think attempting cooking chicken this way turned out to be way more inefficient and enviromentaly damaging than mining for etherium.
Peta coming after him
Big meaty men slapping meat!
new threat unlocked!  "imma slap so many times you'll be cooked alive."
Oh god don't ever say "meatbeater" ever again
Davie504 would cook the chicken with one slap
Asian mom: Note that!
Asian kids: Mom i got low score on test  Asian mom: Your as* will be for dinner
This is how people cook before fire was invented
this is what I didn't need but really want
You know its gonna get real when you hear the mark rober music
ok this is eazy just use the most biggest hand
cook popcorn by slapping it
poland be like 11:54
THis is some good shit.
Mom : What are you doing? Me : studying physics.
People in the 1980’s: well have flying cars in the future 2021: cooking a chicken by slapping it
A stronger arm? And you didn't call Davie504? Davie could do this in 69 SLAPS. I'm calling the police.
I'm from the time that young lads like this were focused on CHOKING THE ROOSTER and not on slaping the chicken...
Mrbeast just showed your video on his Reacts channel! Great job man
That chicken was definitely not cooked.
Is this mark rober brother
Wow the mad lad actually did it, the first time i figured you wouldn't continue but super happy to see how it turned out.
Next: cook a hello fresh meal by slapping.
What temperature would kids have to be to class as cooked? Umm I’m asking for myself
I want the vegan teacher to see this video so bad
F
"we need to slap the chicken harder and harder." I cant tell if he said that intentionally... but if he did, then he made a sex joke.
We went from choking our chickens to slapping them too! Oh boy we're *KINKY!!!* 🤣🤣
9:27 JD
Came for the comedy, stayed for the engineering.
So...The Flash could cook stuff without and oven?
Now he just needs to test the instant cooked pizza with the nuclear explosion
9:21 JD
Warning : no chicken is harm
So this means....  Oh i see. 😱
This dude takes "beating the meat" on a whole new level
i would prefer vertical linear piston style slapper. it can be done with bended stainless steel, you could adjust weight of piston therefore you could able to control slap force.
Can you do a collaboration with Gugafoods and cook a A5 Wagyu by slapping?
Can you light wood slapping it alot? Or melt metal as an alternative way?
Imagine going over this dudes house for Thanksgiving and he prepares a turkey by slapping it with this contraption lol.
This is the least efficient way to cook a steak medium-rare, but it is also teh best. :D
0:58 thought I was watching a Mark Rober vid for a second lol
I didnt know how much I needed to watch this till I did Thanks for the video
11:54  - jebać disa
kelvin if you want to be technical
Meat beater lol
I wouldnt make sweet and sour chicken with that tender meat
One heck of a spankker 😄😄
When your slap so tough it cooks your opponent
Mom, I made the dinner, I slapped a chicken for 38 hours, AND IM SO PROUD OF IT
Earned a sub. What a legend
"in terms of chicken integrity, this chicken looks pretty good"
poor chicken. can you do my ex next?

I still understimate the power of humans..
Asian parents and teachers are gonna love your device.
Chat at 5:46 someone saying the hard R 💀
The most useless way of killings your precious time.
Nice discovery !!! I would still try cooking it with some wood and fire though. 😅
I always wonder, what do they do for living
Amazing
jebac disa
The plastic cuttlery gives me anxiety, why is it still so widely used in the US?
Bet you all was thinking of attaching something else on the end of that meatbeater 😏
This takes “beating my meat to a different level”  Yea someone might’ve said this already
Imagine how hot Davie504 bass is
WTF BROO
Hell ya it’s gonna be soft, I bet that’s the most tenderized piece of meat ever lol
Davie 504 likes this
My laptop runs double this temp lol
This gives "beating over a dead horse" a new meaning, except it's a chicken...
Meatbeater 9000...love it 😂😂😂😂
What are you trying to say to me algorithm? Am I not slaping enough to my chicken?
How would you like your steak sir?  *SLAP COOKED PLS*
🐔👍🏻
Science is amazing! Thank you for the material! ;)
This right here is what science was leading up it. Just glad I'm alive and well to witness it. 😌
Finally i can now throw gas out of my house , this is better for me chicken for life...
Lol, 69,420 was highlighted, surely he’s Tesla fan boy
Looks like chicken. Lol
Someone send this to Russian Badger, they're gonna have a trip with this
AWesome video. If you did one now trying to get to cook the chiken with few slaps as you can.
Your new slogan for your restaurant, "We beat your meat for you so you don't have too."
I mean…could you possibly try any  harder to rip Mark Rober lmao
lmao
THE ORIGINAL WHAT?!
Oddly enough I once cooked my chicken until the juices ran clear by choking it.
Why does he sound like Seinfeld to me....?
Davie504 is proud of your slapping skills
Nobody: Polish People in chat at 9:22:
It's decayed by the time it's edible
I challenge you Louis Weisz and Guga Foods! Make a video about slapping wagyu steak to perfection! :D *imagine: Guga Foods: How would you like your steak? Louis: Can you just slap it 135.000 times for me?  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfE5Cz44GlZVyoaYTHJbuZw
Cant wait to cook my wife
I think I might have said it before, but I’m going to scratch that now, this is the most over the top thing I’ve seen so far and I love it
When science optimizes your meat-beating experience.
why am i high af and watching someone slap a chicken until its cooked?
I mean if you did the experiment in India, you would start and 38 degrees celsius.
now let's put you in the machine u made u chicken.
The meat beater hahahahahaha HA HA AAAAAAAA-
Me: damnit Bobby you broke the grill!!!  Bobby: *starts slapping*
60° Polacy: JEBAĆ DISA
KSC? Kentucky Slapped Chicken?
chicken must have done something really terrible while alive..
original meat beater... NICE
These chickens died for science.
Davie504 would be proud.
Weird to see this on Youtube. Normally when someone is getting paid on the internet to beat their meat it's hosted on OnlyFans.
Sorry, but Walking Out the room and Coming back with the cooked Steak???
11:55 XDDDDD Only ppl from Poland will understand ^^
Very interesting set up, that was fun to watch
I'd like ten of those contraptions. Don't ask me how I'll use them.
Chicken - I have plot armour  He - I HAVE SCIENCE
Did he just find a way to remove the PLOT ARMOR on the chicken 🐔
*Cooking steak for dinner using a slapper*  "How would you like your meat?" "Overkilled"
xDDD 11:55 czat, nasi tam są xDDD
I like. Now cook toast with it
WAITRESS: Can I take your order?  CUSTOMER: Yeah I’ll have the chicken   WAITRESS: How do you want it cooked? We can do it roasted, fried, grilled, or slapped.
Hm
Would be perfect if your living off grid, using pure solar to power everything, and "slow cooked" it.
Tin foil
“Meat beater”
Meat beater 3000
"meat beater"   AYOOOOO
Imagine getting this masterpiece in the recommended 9 months later,couldn’t be me
9:20 Pozdro Mielonka JD
If you need a Slapper, just call my Mom
If this guy hasn’t teamed up with mark rober and the backyard scientist for a vid yet they should do that
11:55  I`m proud of my country
At 8 : 15 this is the meat slapper 9000
I love the amount of jebać disa in czat, LESSSS GOOOO POLAAAAAAND
11:55 POLSKA GUROM XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
These people with ads really timed it well. Most annoying time as possible.
This was a huge waste in every way possible, and it was amazing.
7:52 I wanted more than anything to eat a meal cooked by the power of slap. Davie504 would love that lol
He’s using the engineering music!
bro mi hai scammato quello non è un pollo sei un clickbaiter come hai potuto farmi questo bro io non ci posso credere io mi fidavo di te mio figlio poteva morire acci tua xddd mortacci de pippo ao ma quella bistecca è un pollo quack MI HAI SCAMMATO VERAMENTE COME HAI POTUTO NON CUCINARE UN POLLO IO MI FIDAVO DI TE
professional meat beater
POV: you just came from preston's new video wondering "wtf, he cooked a chicken by slapping it?"
I don't understand how I got here
davie would be proud
Useless at cooking a chicken but would make a good fucking machine.
00:08 Wrong, slapping is how Davey504  cooks all his chicken
Hm, very interesting.
I think that machine is ggood to gift for your mom
Science bitch
History has been made
I can hear the muuuuu from that steak
Yujiro Hanma could pull this off
You can craft a lot
BEAT DA MEAT
_"Meat Beater?"_  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!
Girls: SHUT UP ANd TAKE MY MONEY
"meat beater " is what they called me in highschool
gordon ramsey:mmmm finally some good fucking food
Meat beater: slaps chicken vigorously Chicken: Faster Daddy faster...
U talk too much
Yes this is the content we need
davie504 will enjoy this CHICKEN SLAPP!!
👍
Yo is this Mark Robar brother
sending this to all my physics teachers
no fire on mars or another planet? no problem, here is the perfect solution xd...using of course solar energy for charging the machine..
Dude, stop screeching like a girl with a broken nail! You made it, take it like a man and don’t screech!
The machine is called the meat beater 9000 🤣🤣🤣
Would be interesting to see some bottoms heated up *cough*
Respect for the chicken that got killed to be a part of this.
Microwave oven works the same way
The original meat beater, eh?
In the future we will have a device called the slap   Just slap a chicken it will cook but you gotta say i like ya cut g everytime you wanna use
10:25 “honestly… *10 minutes later* the texture is pretty sh*t”
I can’t stop laughing at the fact that we have come to slapping a chicken, which don’t get me wrong it’s absolutely awesome, but why
Next time use a Tesla Plaid motor
You beautiful crazy man
9:22 look at the comments in upperright corner poland comment section
What à joke.
@Markrober should see this, by the way the music is like what Mark Rober’s video
mark rober:👁👄👁
The meat beater yeeaaahh

This was a truly funny video
Use hand
Davie504 would approve this

I have been trying to remember the word rectifier for like 3 months now. Thank you.
The poor soul of the chicken seeing herself being slapped until cooked must've really hard to see.

Challenge: I dare someone to find a youtube channel with over 100k subs that doesn't have any sponsored videos. And I'll pay you 100 bucks. No joke.
You go against logic
Thank you for using centigrade 👏🏻
I would not eat a chicken like that, it doesn’t look cooked, steak looked ok tho
Sus
You need to stop that little Johnny.  You'll cook your meat if you don't.
the mark dober music
I bet you that steak was moaning the whole time
Lol he said unfortunately this video was sponsored
That’s not even close being the best meat beater in the world.
uploaded on my birthday sick!!!!!
Collab with mark rober
"Beat the life out of it."           Bestie, it's life was already gone.       Loved the video :)
You made a giant meat beater…
Maybe make a soft hand and fast
Elon musk: we need to go to space to evolve as humans Louis:SlAp ChIcKeNnNnNn
POV: you use mark rober's montoge music.
10:35 because you got a lean gross, tough piece of meat that you didn’t even season :/
Sir, how much money was spent on this device?
Only mark rober can use that background song in the beginning
What is in my recommended?: Its complicated
This chicken was put to great use
This is fkn stupid… I love it!
English translation?
Louis : "slap meat" Vegans : 😡
1:56 no one gonna talk about that?
This is one of the reasons I question reality
Every man is thinking it
yo who here from subang? press like!
This man can now Have a normal non-suspecius version of saying : I slap my meat
I tried this. I am very ill
Hi Mark Rober
So glad he uses celsius so I can understand
my dad and mom on the next room would be great at cooking chickens
0:52 *Davie504 has entered the chat*
People in the other room:hmmmmmm.
This guy is the next mark rober he will blow up
Now go cook one by choking it.
this guy is like mark rober?
All you need is 1 slap from a brown or Mexican mom and u will over heat.
This was an epic venture I loved every second
hehe “meat beater”
how cave men cooked meat:
This guy is like the wish mark rober except it’s one of those items that are actually a deal and keep you hooked on the site
When you're from poland and you see whats in the chat when it finally heated up to 60 degrees
Majestic!
This sound like a setup for a William Osmond video.
I have a challenge, do this but with a vegan/vegetarian meat variant, yes im vegetarian so yea thats were i got this from but im not trying to promote veganism or vegetariasm but because ik that there are a few differences and might make this interesting :D
He wants a medium rare steak but he got a rare steak. Disappointing
Me at the first of december at 0:00:00:00:00
Is anyone going to pull Charlie in here?
Very smart
He sounds like pointcrow
w
Louis really cooked a steak added nothing and expected it to be good add some pepper add some salt you donut (shout out to Gordon Ramsey)
Real footage of someone getting there first massage
Jello would be proud.
AYO THE MEEAT BEATER AYOOOOOO
Camp Me: did you bring food? Him: Yes, it's chicken... but it's Raw Me: what ok.. *Intense millions of SLAP"
Correction It’s 75*C chicken has to be cooked at and 82*C reheated
i stated to like him as soon as he said shit lol
This guy: *MEAT BEATER*
*me at 3 am*
But how about making a rotating rubber slapper thing hitting metal to heat it up and you somehow transfer that heat to the meat like beef or chiken efficiently? Could work
Gordon is raging but also proud
It doesn't need to be Celsius it's real science no matter if it is Celsius or Fahrenheit

Mark Rober vibes
Girls in stem:Ugh this is so boring!! Boys:
f
You should try to do it again without contamination
How much for the slap cooker and bags?
Cavemen slapping meat before the fire was invented:
3:33 *Nice*
Hello its vince here with slap and cook you are going to slap your nutts every time you use this product.
bruv this mans a literal wannabe mark rober same way they talk and same music like what prove me wrong
I thought it started as an alive chicken for some odd reason
The one video I waited years for
Your montage music choice is on point.
Damnn I saw the previous video months ago and here I am after YT recommends this lol
Any one else think of RussianBadger’s world of tanks video? Like seriously dude predicted the future.
Uhh am I the only one that likes well done
Mark Rober 2.0
This is like mark rober jr
8:17🤔
This video... Slaps
*Badger would be proud of this*
He Is just beating his meat
The original meat beater
This is something you would see on the original myth busters, well done.
He sounds like mark rober no hate you even have the same music
Scientist 1: "We're going to do some research, but we don't like the old system of measurement. What do we do?" Scientist 2: "Let's pick a bunch of arbitrary measurements and use them as the basis for a new system of measurement." Scientist 1: "OK, what's our reference point? How will these measurements relate to the current system?" Scientist 2: "Make something up." Scientist 1: "What will we call it?" Scientist 2: "Metric" Scientist 1: "You mean we should call the sytem of measurement, a 'system by which something is measured'? That's like calling a cat a feline. Scientist 2: "Just make something up."
Meat beater probaly isnt the best name
Should have brought in a 15 year old boy
😂LMAO I remember your other video lol
This is like a Walmart mark rober but if Walmart had good products
1921: in 2021 we will have flying cars! 2021:
9:20 chat: J**** DISAAAAAAA me: jd xd
u sound like mr beast
Hey babe, what are you doing?  *BEATING MY MEAT*
You know its big brain time when your using the Mark Rober song.
Back to watch for a Second time because why not lol
Cap

1:04 I lost it 😂😂😂
1960: we will have flying cars soon. 2021: we have cooked food with slaps.
Now we can cook meat without using fire or electric(but if you use you hand you'll fell a little bit pain...)

This man is a genius
Imagine dumping a temp and measurement system on a country, just to change yours right after. This was made by American gang.
Its still crazy how the slapper perfectly cooked a medium rare steak
Can we cook one by stomping on it? Let’s try it shall we.
Man creates machine to beat his meat automatically so he doesn't have to do it manually

I imagined a larger bearded man in shirt with the sleeves torn slapping a turkey with his bare hand
At the end it wasn't steak, it was mince
How did the chicken become a Beef steak?
I don’t know if anyone knows what I’m talking about when I say this but… the entire time I watched the only thing I could think of was spaghet *which (believe it or not lol) is a horror game*
Alright… now season it
Checking out all the engineers that were on the St. Jude Livestream and WOW!
I appreciate the effort and work that went into this but it's against the spirit of the meme. It's a single slap that cooks the chicken.
Here after St. Jude charity livestream
Imma need that 💳💥💥💥💥💳💥💥
Steak doesn't cook at 60 degrees wtf
It’s raw!! 🤢🤮
I wouldn't eat it, still looks raw to me. 11:39
Haha, he put my name in with a K in the description.
Hah nice
YES!!! YOU ACTUALLY DID IT!!! Not gonna lie I thought this was never gonna work but you did it! Congrats!

The real temperature for science is Kelvin.
But can you cook a stake by slapping it with your hands?
the meat doesn't taste "good" it taste like "effort"
Reminds me of badgers video .

Changing meat when he left the room
Meat beater 😂😂
The names are great
I don't like that he walked off camera to pour out the meat juice. I don't doubt the engineering but my paranoia ruins the trust I had that the steak was actually cooked by the slapper. Especially because it was cooked really evenly which seems strange even considering the bag into the equation. It was also very intact despite the amount of energy that had to be converted from mechanical to heat energy. I hate to be skeptical because I want to believe this so badly.
What is the conclusion... where is this thing going 😐
I tortured a human by slapping it
I think How to basic can do this
Me : I'll go to bed early tonight  Also me at 3am: cooking a chicken by slapping it

It look like a tati blended in mixer with soya source

How to make a 0.5% efficient oven
put the whole thing inside an aerogel box and put power in. Nothing else really matters.
There is one thing that I think could seriously improve this process and make the chicken truly cooked................Seasoning............ your welcome.
driving the arm from the motor with a connecting rod like in an engine would greatly increase reliability if you're looking to improve that factor and reproduce the experiment.
Oh wow, that would explain why I can sous vide my chicken at 145 (for like, 4 hours).

Another caption for this video  "How kill a died chicken"
So the crux of this video is to beat the meat until it is cooked .... Ok
Just stick flappy rubbers  arround a circular disc and mount is directly on to the motor, this contraption is not efficient
this takes silly to another level
"Meat beater 9001" bruh i'm dead
I give a like for an effort.
I know you already did this project but you could’ve got help from Mark Rober
You do sound like mr.beast.
That poor chicken looking down from heaven looking in disgust at what’s happening to its corpse
Should have used a roller bearing inserted of a plain bolt
he have a motor for slapping but plastic fork for eating..
Why didn't you used the foil paper to  preserve the heat 🤔

Congrats on your dedication to achieve such beautiful and useful goal without abandoning.
Leonardo Da'Vinci of this era.
Salt bae would be proud
I would recommend you do this experiment with only the breasts of the chicken and make 2 slapping machines (forgot name of slap machine) Incase one breaks.
You could open a restaurant with slapped Chicken 🤔
So you failed to cook the chicken.
"Spank and slap, until it is done."
Cooking a chicken by slapping it.  A content which cannot be ignored...

Your voice sounds like @markrober
hes beating the meat
you're not the only one slapping your steak!!
Looks like ur in Peter shripals house
Every machine is a smoke machine if you operate it badly enough!
every comments on his video since the slap started "beat the meat" loool
*i will take your entire stock*

Where is Davie504???
The Hardwork" i respect you with a gun salute 💨💨💥
Finally found Davie504's best friend
The chicken was killed, but at least this guy gave it a beautiful legacy. When I'm dead I want to be slapped to 60 degrees. Come on boyz
show the vegan teacher
Gastronomy
The steak being cooked with slaps is acctually an interesting idea because it would allow you to use cheaper meat which is tough but the slaps tenderize it
Sanic faster cooking dan u
vegan teacher is gonna hate on you next for slapping a chicken so hard SO many time's hahaha!!
ok
I will stick to my veggies
He did all this just to cook a chicken
This reminds me of the horror game when u slap the spaghetti to keep it warm if its cold die immediately
now all you need to do is doing this by hand
Its just waste of time trying such hacks better cook it normally
The phobic sunflower scilly chew because rock biologically fancy notwithstanding a auspicious squid.  foamy, pink minute
uh.... just to be sure how many Chicken is sacrificed for this thing

Cooking a chicken while also tenderizing it win win
I love your videos!
Davie will love it
Kids, don't skip science class. Science is awesome
Next time use it with a live chicken.
Wouldnt that be a great story of a punisher who see this video and punish the guy as its kicking it with chicken..:)
Hello fresh no good for families. Always have to add extra to every pack. good meals but they are lacking.
But why is it cooked at only 60 degrees?
Its all fun and games till the chicken says “harder daddy”
*when engineers get bored buring lockdown
But you forgot to marinate it though..
F
just want to throw it out there   I think his bowls are from ikea
1:05 @Louis Weisz you cant say that
I'll just get 1000 possums to do it.
Meatbeater9001 sounds like a screen name on “To Catch a Predator”.
the meat beater beats meat faster than i can beat my own meat if you know what im saying 😏
DUDE KEEP IT GOING YOUR THE BEST!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
How would u liked your chicken cooked?    *SlaPpEd*
2:34 the start of the slapping chicken 🍗
why dont use a diesel generator .. its cheaper
I Cant believe  the bacteria still survive with the thounsands of slap before it reach the exact temperature🤣
"PeterSripol entered the chat" That got me lol.
Wait, if you slapped a popcorn cernal enough, would it pop?  (I know it probbably wouldn’t)
Yo I’ve made that Hello Fresh recipe you show at the end and it’s good.
What a doughnut
The chicken died just to get slapped a lot of times  Lol
Put the chicken to the top of a smart phone your fried chicken is ready 😅😂😂
You look exactly like a waiter at this restaurant in Boston that is right on the coast and has really good clam chowder. Do you work there???

How to basic is laughing so hard right now
OneVillage could cook it with like 3 slaps
Bruh why just use the heat of the motor to cook the chicken🤣
I bet that steak slaps
Sir GIVE ME THAT MACHINE, GIVE ME THaT MACHINE!
His Mark Rober music though
Steak is good with rice
Therussianbadger fans are rejoicing
Watched until the pewdepie reference. not into that shit at all. good luck to you sir.
Now i know how to cook my fish in case im stranded on an island
Ayoo
Unfortunately it couldn't be possible to say it's safe to eat due it being in the danger zone for way over 2 hours, that shit is full of bacteria by now but at least you got it to cook😌
How many slaps does it take to burn a steak
I know you want to say it don’t say it
serve this to Gordon Ramsay
I like when you said meat beater
Soon we will see machines like this in every household due to the ability to cook and tenderize meat at the exact same time
Thumbnail is clickbait
He missed his chance to call the video, "I beat my meat until it was fully cooked"
“Now cook A5 wagu with it” -guga foods
This chicken slapped.

HOLY SHIT THAT IS STEAK
what if when cave men first discovered cooking they discovered slap cooking instead of fire?
2:30 imagine some random guy walking in while this is happening lol
"The original meat beater"
Hi, I’m Emil Stanek from Bon Appetit, and this is every way to cook a Chicken.
Nerd
Louis: ITS COOKED subtitles: Its Cocked
As a way to improve the meat beater again, it seems like you’re wasting a ton of energy by accelerating and decelerating the lever arm on every repetition. I wonder if creating a meat beater that rotates fully around with a flexible arm would be more efficient so that the only energy lost is friction (other than energy lost in slapping the chicken, which is obviously desired)
O.O
Has anyone called Khaby Lame
Next level with alive chicken
Me:*slap the chicken with my quirk* Chicken:*become roasted chicken*
Wait that's not a chicken thats a steak this is not in the title
when i wasn't paying attention to what he was saying before then i hear him say," without hitting the chicken all that hard."  my reaction," wut : | "

with the intro of this video my first initial thoughts were," DAMN thats sexy!"
wow he beat his meat to perfection
The old meat beater
Down bad man.
So technically Star Platinum could cook a chicken with its ability to stop time.
Just imagine a chicken watching this 🤣🤣
My guy should’ve used a steam engine
Just one word it slaps btw
this is all just great
RIP chicken
That plastic knife is strong asf
What's the temperature like? Is it hot ?
i love the internet
It´s Fucking RAW!!!
lol. he sayed holy cow. a steak is made from a cow.
That has to be cap
Is it just me, or is the music giving me the mark rober vibe?
He looks like Kimbal Musk
mark robers little brother
this is awsome! can you try to cook something with jackhammer?
blowiematron chain
this make beat the meat on the next level
The most disgusting part about this is the fact he eats with his mouth open. He's an obnoxious person though so one would presume that. Anyone who screams YOOOOO! and claps themselves is peak degenerate.
I feel sorry for that chicken :(
Literally the most tenderized steak to ever exist, like it's already been chewed for you as soon as it hits your tongue.
I have a better idea. Just use this to tenderize a steak. Make two steaks, One cooked normal, And the other tenderized for 5 minutes with the slapper. Both cooked either under broiler or on stove top. Blind taste test pick your favorite!
Davie504 is happy
madlad
Beat. That. Meat.
OH YES DADDY that chicken is saying
Now you officially say you beat your meat.
01:04       08:17

Try cooking a chicken by choking it, ill be impressed
Mantis Shrimp, or stomatopods can punch 60-mile-per-hour, heating up the water around them.   They cook their prey with 1 slap. basically FuckHands McMike

ah yes, the "Meat Beater 9001"
Walmart Mark Rober addresses the questions we need.
Can you autoclave a steak?
I watches this in black and white cuz of my phones sleep schedule
Please, please contact guga foods to do a collaborative video. I'm sure he'll bring some high quality meat to the situation, and you guys can laugh while not telling his cousin, angel, how it was cooked.
Did you eat it??????
1:55 sussy sus 😳
i to kurwa jebać disa w 9:21
If only world leaders were focused more on beating their own meats.
How come he's using Mark Rober's background music?
The next gen of BEATIN MAH MEAT
Cooking it whole making it more tender
I appreciate the effort, and really liked the video, but there's an elephant in the room... Pasteurization temperature isn't sterilization temperature, and there's a different chart for safe-to-eat temperatures... Pasteurization isn't supposed to eliminate ALL bacteriae, only just enough to extend shelf life - and it isn't as simple as "maintaining a lower temperature for a longer period of time", otherwise nothing would ever rot. Also, there's a temperature range where bacterial proliferation thrives, and that didn't seem to have been taken into consideration. The longer it takes to surpass the crossing point between this and the paseurization point, the longer you'll have to keep it at a higher temperature in order to kill those extra bacteriae. You put yourself into a grave danger there, so kudos anyways 🤣
This is why kids need proper education
Davie504 will proud of you
Davie504 must be so proud of this
Russian badger be like
How about making the same thing but for something else heh
Meat beater
Send this to vegan teacher
Somebody make a counter of how many times he says meat beater, beating, beat.
Well... slap me around and call me Susan, he did it.
Meat beating science baby!
Unus Annus would be proud
Would sending strong vibrations through the chicken also create enough or even more internal friction in the meat?
The most ridiculous video I've seen all year.
What music did you use? It absolutely slaps!
All that money and work for chicken mhm totally efficient.
why not just 50 people slapping the chicken lol
Best stake on the world
Less talking , more actions please
see how many slaps dose it take to cook an alive chicken.
yo this music is silvilki show EN’s theme song
now do it in one slap
@xan404
Was that bad to use Celsius degrees instead of Fahrenheit?
Cooking with jotaro: Jotaro: só today we are making a steak... Oro oro oro oro!!!

Wow several months, you must be starving
Came here to hear, "it's actually not that bad!" in a voice that's 2 octaves higher than your norm. Wasn't disappointed.
9:21 Jebać Disa, Do you know what its mean?
I actually do the same with my gf lol

Who is here after watching meme 😂
You could say he was "beating his meat"
I don't even remember how I got here, but thank you very much for your hard work and willingness to push through setbacks. This was something else.
Lol not only cooked but also tenderized
HOW.. @10:25... HOW COULD YOU NOT SAY "This steak slaps.". This ENTIRE video I waited for the obligatory, "This food really slaps." pun, and I am SO DISSAPOINTED.
母「早く寝ないとおしり焼肉にしますよ！」
Who knew that beating your meat. Or in this case, slapping your meat, would be an optimal way to cook
You might even call this a thigh slapper...XD
1:55 "really came and handy"
I thought he was going to actually slap the chicken, would've been even crazier, but cool...
True definition of beating meat
This guy is like Mark rober exept better
"im slappin' this chicken very fast" -mymind2021
Anyone here just skipped to the part where the chicken is cooked?
Chicken Warming
meow meow meow
10 years later.... This guys made a restaurant that cook meat with slapper.
Davie 504: 😐😐😐😐..... slap chicken now😏
When you say its tasty, me=it stinks
Cooking, especially chicken, is also about denaturing proteins for texture. You wouldn't want to eat chicken cooked to 55 C... It's an unpleasant texture
Anyone who’s worked in a kitchen knows 135 is when it’s safe to eat, 165 is what health and safety considers safe to eat, and 166+ is what everyone considers ruined
Somone give this guy a scholarship on Food Engineering
This algorithm is tweakin
Try it with A5 wagyu.
Vasily Kamotsky can cook it with two... maybe three slaps
Masoquists be watching this like
i would have just made two wheel with hard rubber slap paddles and span it at high rpm on each side of the chicken and set the motors timing so it would back and forth slappage...
9:26 j...ć disa :D
you might have revolutionized the cooking world with this one
Why the fuck am i watching a guy slapping a chicken for 2 hours and then eat it
slap can cause heat... i know it so well... 😭😭
Disliked the vid when he didn’t say the steak “slapped”
9:22 the chat 😂😂😂😂😂
a big creator acknowledging adam ragusea.. oh my god
This takes me back to Sunday afternoons. Granny doing her crosswords, Dad and I watching the game, little Sis flirting with Uncle Rob and Mom in the kitchen slapping a chicken.
I cooked chicken by telling memes
9:21 Polacy patrzą na czat
F for all
Do a vid with mark robber
Saitama could probably one big slap that
11:54 XD JD ARMY
Well my life can end peacefully after knowing that you can cook chicken by slapping the fuck out of it. I need nothing else
Isnt gordon react to this last time?
They called me a madman
What a creative way to waste so much energy to cook a chicken
Meat Beater😏
This video slaps
Black people joined the chat🙂
can it also beat other types of meat ?? Asking for a friend..
Not to be hater and stuff but I think that's a steak
so thats how cave men cooked their chicken before discovering fire
When you don't have a basic course in fatigue.... god so much potential ruined by the needy social media...
The dump the juice part out was kinda sus if you want to keep it real .  And the heat probably came from the friction of it rubbing it , not really smacking it . It’s at a rub type of angle . Like an Indian burn
F
THE STEAK SMELLS LIKE A STEAK! *WOAW*
I think this is literally the perfect instance of... 'but why tho?'
He really "Beat the meat"
Where is Davie504?

Whew! I'm just glad he didn't do a video on whether choking your chicken would cook it.
komontarze 9:24 polska zrozumie
I can't tell if I learned anything from this or not. But I was definitely entertained.
WHAT IF....... you just put it in the oven? hm?
I'm not surprised Hello Fresh is a sponsor.
I hate the strange moaning at the beginning of this video. It blasted on my car stereo, loudly, without warning, while I was in the drive-through at Chick-fil-A… and I can tell you; people looked at me with the strangest face.
Hmmm... New cook method...
The meat beater 9001 is the best name
I bet his mom was waiting with that steak outside that door😂😂
lol
@Davie504 Come see this. His SLAP is trully powerful
"Meat beater"
Alternative title: I cooked a chicken by spanking it.
If it's called the MB9001, what's MB9000? 😳
Mashed chicken
if you have a problem, slap it. if it doesnt work. you clearly dont use enough of slap.
@ david504 will like it
Imagine: Vegan Teacher watching this 👀
This chicken died just to get slapped for six hours straight
absolute mad man
Davie504: "This is the power of slap!"

Friends: Join us for dinner! Me: I'll join you guys after i watch someone beat his meat.
Some guy I never saw before cooked a chicken and a steak by slapping it. My thoughts: That's both awesome and cringy and something Guga from Gugafoods should react to
C suck
When human think science could not be further advance, this dude prove us wrong.
Somewhere, there's a giy who probably mistook the title of slapping meat in different way and made this machine for himself. ( and not for cooking)
It doesn't seem to a very energy efficient method to cook a chicken, but very entertaining !
9:21 tego na czacie się nie spodziewałem :O
Bunch of nerds figuring out new ways to Beat their Meat.....
SLAP LIKE NOW!
Mark Robers brother
Poor chicken ☹️☹️

You should try a rotary system with multiple slappers. That would fix the problem of mechanical breakage.
thats how they warm up your sis
I'm getting serious Mark Rober vibes. Thank you for this pointless process. I NEEEDED it
People in 1985: People in 2015 will have flying cars, smart houses and home-size nuclear power plants... People in 2020: I cooked chicken by slapping it!

This is quite possibly the coolest thing I've seen this year
Então era disso que a minha mãe queria dizer falando quando falava: "vou te esquentar na porrada"
Why i am here ?
Why didn't you just add slapping surfaces onto a wheel and then turn it?
Cooks steak by slapping it and cuts it with a plastic knife u definitely know how to get things done
How the flash beats his meat
same music from Mark Robber videos

This is how Davie504 cooks his chicken.
This guy: wastes hours inventing machine that constantly beats meat. Boys during puberty: *Look what they need to mimic a fraction of our power*
He go out with a bag of Jiuce and return with a bag of Medium Steak >.>
"The future is now, old man"
im too tired i want what??
The "Jebać dissa" in the chat. LMAO!
brings meat beating to an entire new level
11:55 JD

Davie504 would approve
Me:needs to wake up early  You tube:have seen a chicken cooked by slapping befor?
1:05 the original what 🤨
what if you swap it for a jackhammer?
6-8 hours with 135000 slaps, this is slow. All you need is david504, 1 slap is all you need. Thank me later😎
Your speaking style, ascent and background music is same as mark rober
Image couple of caveman wondering why the dinosaur taste better after they beat it to death with clubs for like half a day.
the moment u went outside the door... that could be anything u do to that steak imao...u should not go outside...
One of the great content videos here in YT! Thank you!
I think Davie504 would like this video
so this is a reason why people slap asses and then call it yummy
The beginning of ww3.
“The original meat beater” Me: who dares summon me
This guy.. i dont know why... But he kinda annoys me, in a way The content is good.. its just. I cant put my finger on it. Maybe its just his yee yee ass haircut 🤔.
THIS IS FASCINATING
i feel like this thing could be used as a torture device lol
It's totally raw, and why he uses plastic knife? Is disable?
Didnt expect to see peter here. He seems to be showing up everywhere these days
why you show meat after going kitchen ? swap bag ?
Gordon Ramsay: IT'S FUCKING RAAAWW  *SLAP IT*  THERE YOU GO NOW IT'S COOKED!!!!
Searching for a Davie504 comment
the music just goes with every science video no matter who makes it
Help me, I don't know how I ended watching someone beating his meat on You Tube right now
that meat still says moo
I'm pretty sure your steak was the issue and not the machine.  As the temperature rises the fat begins to render and it adds a cooling effect; in the BBQ world it's known as a stall.
Yo vine a ver esto por Javier Santaolalla, es interesante jaja
So that's the thing called "Beat it and eat it"
9:21 XDDDDDDDDDDD
This is what internet is made for
I’m vegan and this is wasting energy, but for science… I dub this justified.
Seems slightly less efficient than using fire or an oven.
9:21 i to JD na czacie XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
Glad to be hear before 11M views for such an important project Next thing is to do it with bare hands
Now, this is science i was looking for!
A cooking machine that works by slapping the food, what a time to be alive.
i like ya cut g
You could have slapped IT yourself for 2 months🤣
Whole new meaning to beating your meat
So now open a restaurant
9:59 its got what?!
That was unexpectedly amazing!

Where do I get one.... and are there different attachments available? Asking for a friend.
I'm triggered that I'm hearing Mark Rober music on a not mark rober channel
This is why i hope aliens never find us. "I cooked a human by slapping it"
And now we ask an even more important question. . . Whasss the vegan teacher gonna do when she sees this.
Davie504 Approves it
Taking "Beating my Meat" to the next level
at some point i thought it was impossible. awesome
9:41 He went to another room with the bag before showing the steak to the cam hmmmm
Energy waste
the machine is the personifcation of: "i ilke you cut G"
Slap rate.
Still looks better than the shit I cook

Therussainbadger needs to see this…
I mean, I know that Celcius is way better than Fahrenheit to calculate temperature, but don't they use Kelvin for scientific experiments?
I can imagine a scene where Flash takes a time out to cook some snacks with a slaps, in the middle of intense fight.
all I'm saying is  if kinetic energy can become thermal energy, how hard would I have to punch a chicken to cook it?
Neighbours: 👁️👄👁️ again? 3 hours in row? What a torpedo Louis: I cooked chicken by slapping
Why would you use a disposable plate and fork/knife tho...
So jello's question "how hard would I have to punch a chicken to cook it" is answered
“Meat beater 9001”  Nope 😳
Ah to see Tumblr affekt everything internet related

If this takes this much slaps to cook a chicken my gf's ass might be burnt
This is where YouTube recommendation has led me into
the vegan teacher will make a vid - i killed a louis by slapping it

He is just like Mark Rober but he does more important stuff. Stuff that would save this world from hunger during apocalypses
I'm glad This is in my recommend

Sheesh
When u don't have a chicken cooker you just slap it😆
Davie504 is proud of this
How hard would you have to punch it to cook it in one punch
So in theory if I slap person that hard for this long he falls to the ground with his head cooked.nice thanks.
oh man peter
1:05 oop
You can say the machine "The Meat Beater"
AAAAA
why are you eating with plastic cutlery?!?!

Shout out to this guy for not having a lot of ads in a hard and expensive vid like this
I’m late to the party but I have to say it: Beating your meat has reached a new stage of evolution.
While it is a really cool experience, I'm not entirely sure this process would it fit the definition of cooking something by slapping it. Maybe if you broad it a bit.
This video is Bssss !.Next time try to slap your face
Interesting

Gordon ramsay would like to know your location.
I would rather go to kfc 😂
In Chicken heaven: How many slap you had in your life? Clap cooked chicken: YES
Hello everyone and welcome to food theory
Maybe it's just me. But watching this I felt like the kid in that old commercial saying " mister owl, how many licks does it take to get to the center of a topsie pop?" Except here the lollipop is a chicken and instead of licks we have slaps.
Oof, when he walked out of the room with the steak my heart sank. Now we will never know if its the same steak. The chicken wasnt displayed without video cuts either. I want to believe he did it, but ive seen so many scams that i have a hard time believing without the footage.
Deja vu???
The chicken watching his body as a ghost getting continuously slapped be like: wtf bro?! Wat'v you done TO my Body?!!
madlad
So tender
The second mark rober  Even the music

*Meat Beater* Ill take 5 of those
How about cooking a live chicken by beating the shit out of it?
7:48 now that’s a real dream right there
Sometimes you just gotta beat your meat for science.
But how........
E P I C
This is a new meaning to “beating your meat.”
1 slap for each view and we’ll have a Thanksgiving buffet.
Rip to the chicken who was slapped about a million times till its cooked
Damn I wish the steak was better so you would’ve said “it slaps!”
should have used a V8 engine
Imagine being a chicken, then dying and having you corpse slapped into pulp
don`t you have an oven?
HOLD ON A MINUTE!!!  Were you slapping a chicken in Peter Sripols workshop?
what is the name of the music at 7:48 plz ? thx
Hello fresh sounds cool but can you cook it with 135,000 slaps I didn’t think so
Bois that chicken suffered so much that it burned to cooked chicken
"the internet is a cold and dark place filled with scammers and hackers" the internet:
A true slapper. Davie would be proud
Mark rober knock off
1:05 "the original meat beater"😭
It’s a young Doc Brown
I learned that if you slap your wife to much she will have a fever.. Who will cook for me than 👍👍thanks
not ganna lie that kinda disgusting
the definition of beating meat
Thañks bro indians cant do nothing
9:22 polish kiddo aprooved
spas hak
Wait untill that vegan teacher sees this
I was just thinking... but, instead of that design, why dont you make a water wheel like design, have it rotate around while using soft rubber like paddles to slab the bag, if done properly you could have more then one paddle hitting the back in quick secession which should in theory cause it to work faster.
10:53 "I was cautiously optimistic for our avian alternative." Very scientific for basically saying "bruh the steak was ok so the chicken should be ok too."
hmm....make like car engine with 3 or 4 slap in a turn maybe can speed up the process
Says he cooked chicken but it's a steak
This is my fav ytber
Eeeeeeeee
y'all could have made the arm out of only metal. probably
Was watching...was interested....but then your dumbass said "durrrr LETS GO... 30 times. .." cringe.....
Go to school for years learning how to be an engineer  Use knowledge to cook chicken with slaps.  Worth it.
Gordon Ramsey is gonna be mad bro
In the name of Davie504, Meat Beater 9001 is APPROVED. But if you want your chicken cooked by slapping you could've just asked Davie and he would holy slap it. It would be instantly coocked.
No way
Huge miss on not having a thumbs up on the slapper: slap the like button.
This is the same engineering to make a jerk off robot

Who noticed the mark Robert music at the start

Necesito sub español porque no entiendo ni kk
You remind me of mark rober
🤟🔥
How to cook meat  Google: Use an Oven  Bing:
If the chicken is in a insulated hard walled container and vigorously shaken it would be like slapping it on all sides and might work even better?   What about trying a paint can shaker machine?  (after insulating the can to keep heat from escaping).    I hope someone tries this as I would love to see a new temp record even if it might liquefy the chicken.
belts in a nutshell:
I no one gonna talk about how he called it the meat beater lol
TheRussianBadger: "If kinetic energy can be transferred into thermal energy, how hard would you have to slap a chicken too cook it?"  This guy be like: I'm on it fam. 😎👌
Closest I can get to 42069 7:16
Gordon Ramsay would approve.
Louis’ oven: *breaks* Louis: *cooks a chicken by slapping it* *“Modern problems require modern solutions.”*
Davie504 would be proud
Isn't background music similar to Mark robber's channel music
The background music gives mark rober vibes
Mark robert be like:
copying mark rober
This music sounds familiar
I think you're using a DC motor there. DC motors tend to have worse efficiency when you run them slowly, so I would suggest that you run them at a higher speed. Also, you should make your arm as light as possible so the motor can spin faster, making it more efficient, causing it to generate less heat.
the first oven was made in 1490 people before 1490:
Yoooo didn't you try this before and it was a FAIL! 😂 I'M ready to see if you could really pull it off my boy! Thanks YouTube Algorithm!
sounds like someone is beating there meat literally
*Slap dem chicks.*
I would have suggested heating the slapper to body temp at first for one
The meat beater 🤣
13 year olds when there parents leave
Of course... in order to negate the exponential growth of bacteria for the length of time it remained below the safe zone, you'd need to "cook" it for a few hours at that low of a temperature. There's a reason you are supposed ot cool food off as quickly as possible after you're done cooking and eating it
there is a guy named Giu that don't like the look of the chicken , he said that it look like " une brique de merde" sorry for his mean french :x
Understandable, mr wannabe mark rober
Talk about beating meat
This is what the internet was made for
Davie504 likes this
The reason of not eating it wasn't because of contamination, it was because it was LITERALLY U N D E R C O O K E D !
Since it was about destroying bacterias this machine could technically heal infected wounds so yeah... Just letting you think about that
Overly tender steakkkkkkkkkk
Wth is wrong with you
He is gordem slapsy
to make a holy steak, you need to beat the hell out of it

I never heard of such a crazy way of cooking food. I enjoyed your dedication to make this happen. Have fun and success always.
Dude done found a new way to beat meat. Right on. Right on.
Could be useful in the future
you got the mark rober vibes, and music... thumbs up!
@louis you can’t cook a chicken by slapping it are you stupid. Get your head checked
what is this music i hear mark wowber
I would love to see you and Mark Rober working together on a project. I can only imagine what you guys would come up with
Davie504 would be proud of this
Now that's a Cool one for MythBusters
Imagine being bought from a market only to get the crap slapped out of you
use ball bearings
We have to get Gordon Ramsay to react to this. Like to help make it happen.
I also love it when a machine beats my meat
You should collaborate with mark rober!  That would be a great video!
Slap vide
that steak looks so bad oh my god, sorry, pretty cool though lol
THE CHICKEN: daddy chill 😩its Hot 🥵
Nick Digiovanni would like to know your location.
To be fair, when you cook a chicken you're sleeping its molecules with higher energy molecules
The steaks’s texture was bad cuz you didn’t season it
Gordon Ramsey ain't got nothing on him
Celsius fanboys are the saltiest people on the internet
David504 fans - Go to 3:30 - slap like
Very impressive,  but can you actually make a decent meal by slapping the contents of a Hello Fresh box?

Hello fresh is actually good my parents bought it twice
the balls on this man
how jucking cold are you guys eating, a chicken need at least 150c and a steak 100c
Now we just need a machine cooks by spinning
This guy is the new mark rober
Conclusion: slapping is not efficient. Just use an oven
Damn making a steak that is good without seasoning and all that crap holy cow lol
*Meatbeater*
This is fantastic. Real science. Answers to questions that everyone has asked at one point in time.
This is what YouTube was made for
not being funny or anything it all still looks raw ive never had blooded steak as cooked or pink chicken good video though when my stakes are like Gandhi's flip flops i presume there eatable lol
He slapped a chicken.
He did it
Show Gordon Ramsey this
imagine that vegan teacher watched this an made a video
I was born in the right generation
Definitely don’t believe that lol so it browned on all sides stop it
Up next , cooking a chicken by doing absolutely nothing
This sort of ingenuity that a lot of us gen z folks have makes me hopeful for the future  If we can cook a chicken with slaps what’s our limit?!
someone send this to russianbadger.
LMAOOO he really thought 69420 was how many he was at 😭😭😭
夜の営みにも使えて便利
So thats how people enjoyed chicken before fire
Why are you beating your meat with that??
I fell asleep with YouTube on and here I am
How did I even get here..

My sister is playing my Xbox as I'm watching this, and when you got the steak to 60°, I heard the rare achievement sound go off
10M people: interesting
In thermodynamics I'm acutally used to Kelvin instead of °C. But 1° of temperature difference is the same as one Kelvin of temperature difference. Just the offset is different so its at least way better then °F. (In never really got why you would use a temperature measurement thats based on a mix of different chemicals that you dont really use that often in every day life anyway...)
welp now he can say he was beating his meat to the electric company if they ask about the bill
Ask Vasily to slap that chicken, it'd be cooked instantly
beat the meat
This has taken "harder daddy" to a new level
Turn to Jesus before it's too late you will suffer in hell If you don't spread the Gospel so please buy GOD some time Amen✝️🥰
Also good job but don't go smashing on this chicken he has a wife you know
You season that bad boy?
Just want to point out love your channel man but seriously quit stealing Mark Rober's music
I am surprised that after all that, you didn't pre-season the meat beforehand.
Davie504: proud of U
if you hit your meat like this it will cook ;0
The backyardscientist tlked about this video and I dnt recall seeing this channel. And I slapped the subscribe button
Let me guess, you’re Canadian?
You could put some sauce in the bag and marinate it through slaps
meat beater 9001…
this is gonna sound stupid, i know. BUT why did you opt for that huge machine?  The engine of a car has cilinders that go up and down very fast. All you have to do is increase the pistonhead with a metal plate, but you can use the entire engine case. And no, you dont have to use a car engine. A crank is also found in a moped, or a motorbike engine.  It can go up and down many times a minute, and all you have to do is connect the electric engine which you now use to the crankshaft.  Would that not have been Much easier and stronger?
"My crack team of discord engineers" Well I mean at least they're honest about their crack usage.

They say Visily Kamotski always cooks his chicken this way, usually only takes him a slap or 2.
I probably have believed this if you didn't walk out of the room with the meat before coming back and putting it on a plate

Davie504 is proud.

I can't believe my own eyes!! You have real content!! and ten mill, my respects.. KUDOS for the helps of Peter Srpool... I do love to see videos that defy logic ...
Fire was discovered in 500.000 BC  People in 500.001 BC:  Yeah, it's unoriginal but I did want to do it
Every peace of meat would be… petty tinder.  Don’t hate, you laughed
I like u didnt gave up many versions things break u make again and again that great
Yo that steak isn't done. Its still fucking moving. Might need to slap another 125k hits on that bad boy
"I didn't really expect to cook the chicken in the first try but to look like a very good opportunity"  "But something felt off"  Me seeing the video not even halfway done: *I am 4 parallel dimensions ahead of you*
I love how the wasted energy was way more than enough to cook the chicken, I love it
cook deeznuts
7:41 i swear i watched this at 2:50 am 😱
Imagine gatekeeping someone's experiement because they weren't using your favorite temperature unit.
Что я здесь забыл? Чёрт его знает! :/

Louis Weisz you truly are legendary status YouTuber to me bro. And I don't just say this to make it sound good. NO. This is what a true YouTuber is.
If only that chicken knew it was goana change history before being slaughtered
**takes shot of vodka** Damn it badger

This video became so popular that the airfryer was invented
You could say hes....  Beating his meat
that's cool but... how many slaps do you need to cook a burger?
you wasted all that time just to eat steak with a PLASTIC KNIFE and FORK?
I might need the meat beater 9001
Cooks a chicken for hours only to be the equivalent of cooking a chicken for a minute and 2 seconds
もしかして君も、ホルモンし〇田さんから来たの？
Well that's a way to beat your meat
This takes “beating my meat” to another level
Wow this insane cool
This takes to another level phrase beating my meat
We must unslap the polar ice caps
SpaceKook industries is interested in hiring you
Why do people dislike this?They clicked for cooking a chicken by slapping it,they got cooking a chicken by slapping it.
slap cooked chicken
Ok idk about you guys but he sounds like Tobias fron TAWOG

The family friendly version of beating your meat
Me: lets go do homeworks *opens browser* Also me: *see this* well well well lets find out
"meat beater" that didnt sound right
"They says i'm a mad man"
OOOOOOOOHHH HE SAID F*CK
To cook a whole chicken it needs to get to about 75 Celsius on the inside so that chicken was not really cooked  But good job on the steak that was cooked
lol
This is good if you dont want to use gas
He should make an entire restaurant based on this
As a professional chef, I am absolutely mortified at the results of this. It looks absolutely disgusting and I'm sure it tastes worse! 😨🤮  But as a lover of science and I'm interested in really weird things because I'm a flat out NERD, I'm actually impressed and and intrigued. 🧐🤓 So I'm totally conflicted... 🤔🤨😜🥴 Good job guys! 😃🤩🥰👍
Imagine if that chicken randomly started moaning
I live in 40 degree heat
Oh thats why sometimes my dad slap mommy cuz he wants mommy to be hot?
Me: mom I want mark rober. Mom: we have mark rober at home.  Mark Rober at home:
Every culinary expert such as myself will tell you this chicken has been in the tdz for hours

Survival tips
you could say that the meals "slapped"
I’d completely forgotten it was called the “Meat Beater” 😂😂😂
OR...you can build a smoker with cinder blocks and wood you cut down from local tree falls and cook the meat in the same amount of time while feral cats come up to you for snuggles. Way better. :-D YOUR DNA DICTATES THAT YOU EAT SMOKED MEAT! ::-D (my 14 year old made me watch this after a dinner of medium rare smoked beef)
am i high?
I just find you and I wasn't expecting peter on this video.
It's pink, that's nasty.

Slap the bacteria

Taking "Beating meat" to a whole nother level.
Next Will be: "how hard do i have to punch a chicken  to Cook It "
Imagine you die and somebody does this on your corpse. Worth it
Best video title on youtube.
Its official name is the meat beater he said it first
Mark Grover music vibe
Who else here because they saw a meme on the Internet and wondered if  someone actually tested this lol
just dm davie504 he will slap that chicken for you
This reminds me of Technoblades Potato War, you both would work day and night for a specific number to appear on screen
you remind me of "the doc" from back to the future.
Honestly this might be the stupidest crap I've ever seen.
should of used a live chicken the chicken already has like 30C when alive
*The meat beater*
Lmao coward. You totally should’ve eaten it. I would’ve. Pasteurization is for the WEAK!!!
Thats actually the best hellofresh ad ever totally catched me because funny to compare to slapping device ...
I see, than for scientific purposes. Thesis: cooking a chicken through vacuum and/or pressure. As we know the earth has a molten core due to the extreme pressure and friction of the many particles coming together.  how long would it in fact take to cook something using a calculated constant of vacuum and or pressure to create friction
What’s the song that plays in the beginning of the video? I’ve been hearing it around the internet and it’s driving me nuts that I can’t find it!
New way to cook meat
So much wasted chicken
So I guess you could say that, he successfully beaten his meat
There does exist something called the "Temperature Danger Zone", where it's below the pasteurization temperature, but warm enough to increase the development of bacteria.
He's using Mark Roberts music. HOW DARE HE!!!!
Good job now beef
I'm asuming the music is a copyright free sample but amusingly, Mark Rober uses the same one quite regularly =P
Mmyes
unus annus did it better. But seriously this was sick.
alright time use this tutorial and eat chicken only this way, and get 20 different cases of salmonella while doing so.
sonic can do it in 9.6 picoseconds
maillard effect is not going to happen at 60°C... that steak turned brown somewhere else
Lame and silly
Im happy for you man... you have succeed 😆😆😆 congratulations
1:17 Me vs the life
He cut the camera when he suposlly got it done and even went out of the room so... How are we supose to know that it's still the same steak?
Boys on 1 Dec, 12am: 1:55
A question as old as time lmao
Gives a whole new meaning to Beating your Meat.
The meat beater... uhh...
It's hilarious that after the first video everyone was on board with better ideas instead of being like this is dumb. Love the internet.
With all the brilliant engineering ideas he came up with, I can't believe he didn't take into consideration all the slapping would tenderize the meat
Now try to cook it in 1 hit
It's almost 4am, I have a presentation in few hours and I'm watching how a chicken is cooked by slapping it. I love humanity!
He took beating your meat to the next level
So if I beat my meat too much it will get cooked?
Are you sure that this didn’t come from the beginning of RussianBadger’s _Tactical Fried Chicken_ World of Tanks video where Geuce (I think) says “all I’m saying is that if physical energy can be turned into thermal energy, how hard would I have to punch it to cook it?”
Well i guess you could say, he beat his meat and cooked it.
what if slap cooking was a normal thing in a parallel world 😂

This is the man, ladies and gentlemen, that took the meaning of the phrase "beat your meat" to a whole new level.
Came back to see this from the Food Theorist video
Man looks like a discount Mr Beast
So you finally did it
degrees celcius is cringe
(top left corner) 6:48 PEWDIEPIE
This is Davie504’s actual personality/voice reveal
Already boerd
Be honest, you didn't make that machine to cook chicken. You just made this video to explain the slapping noises in your room to your parents.
*-hi-*
Is anyone here after watching matpat's slap cooking video
So you spanked your meat and now it's cooked!
A YouTube video about a guy slapping his meat and no rude jokes?  How times have changed.
6:47 when ur home alone
Does the meat beater beat uh..a sausage tee hee
oh my god i is true
In appearance it looks like a giant turd
Between this video and the last.. I’ve watched about 30 minutes of a man building stuff to slap chickens.. that is as much of that that I will need for a lifetime haha.. I literally sat here repeating.. I can’t believe I’m watching chickens being slapped.. not mad about it.. just don’t understand why I did it haha

I was commenting now to see my comment in future coz i know this video gonna recommended me after 10 years
How much do you have slap to boil water
Chicken, slappers only.  *goldeneye music plays*
F
This man took “beat my meat” to a WHOLE other level
JEEZ SO MUCH VERIFIED CREATORS
Why not make it a wheel with lots of soft rubberish hands that slap it as it turns? Speed it up to slap fast and with the softer hands it shouldn't beat the shit to death and make it mushy.
JD JD JD JD JD
This makes a whole new meaning to beating meat
Pov- He replaced it with cooked steak while dumping the juice
Rare video of me home alone
I only liked the ace combat music
The magical reason chemically possess because dorothy likely transport opposite a beautiful cheek. daffy, selfish reaction

Get Gordon Ramsey on the phone
Ok now do an alive one
I couldn't resist clicking on this. Believe me, I tried for a good min into another video. Resistance was futile.
I am trying this but with my own hands
Who else is here because of MatPat? Pretty cool stuff if you ask me.
I just realised my parents were trying to cook me my whole life
The least imaginable things we'd ever search online end up finding us regardless. This video is exhibit #1 for this case.
I'm getting serious Mark Rober vibes
So when is the Kickstarter for Chicken Slappers coming?
Omg food theorists made I vid about this  He had the same sponsor as u
🥩🤛
Not the hero we needed, but the one we wanted.
So stupid but so perfect
Are we just gonna forget he was on food theory?
No one:  Boys during puberty:
Slapperssss
I wouldn't eat that
F to all the failed attempts. Also Hello Fresh is pretty great imo.
Just the kind of chef everyone needs.
The og meat beater
I like how the machine is called the meat beater. 😂
You took it off camera???
Lies
lets all be honest this is just young blond mark robber
Im good buddies with the guy who originally did this equation to find the answer and then it turned into this meme.
POV you can’t figure out the oven
Imagine slapping the chicken then u hear it say harder daddy
tldr: stayed up too late beating meat. lil rough but pretty tasty since :juices:
https://youtu.be/LHFhnnTWMgI?t=715 <-- mielonka mielona xD
All My Life I Wondered Why, but now I realize my parents were trying to cook me.

Woah sience
Boys during puberty:
Gotta eat that beat meat 🍖.
Slapping chicken
My mom: Why is my child burnt?
Never knew slapping cocks can cook them
OH YEAH BEAT THAT MEAT!!!!!

Next step buy a live chicken and try killing it with slaps then cooking it with slaps
Bruh this guy literally copied mr.bro like:/
Meat beater
Next one is can you slap a chicken to death?

You gotta be saitama to do this by hand
"now this does put a smile on my face"
NOW THIS this is experiment
Bruh the headeach and never ending fixes to engineer
This guy is no doubt Mark Rober 2.0
Plot twist: he got salmonella
11:58 Better yet, Hello Fresh should include a chart showing the cook eta if you were to slap it😜
They said it could not be done
You did not cook chicken. Why didn’t you show us the steak being put into the bag? This isn’t believable. 🚮
And that polish guy spamming jebać disa 😅😅
the meat beater is pretty much chews the food along with cooking it
Thank you.
isn't that a turkey
So.... youtube totally recommended me a video of some guy beating his meat for 12 minutes....
When you touch a women’s private place a lot of times and then the women slaps you a lot of times:
Now make it water powered for green chicken slap cooking!
Lousy test, not 100% safe and and looks lousy
it takes a true engineer to change the meaning of "slapping my meat" as a hobby.
I see mark rober in him. This man has potential
He beat that meat so good
Meat beater 9001
My parents upstairs just trying to cook  a chiken
You're on food Theory, you're famous bro.🍗

MatPat Food Theory sent me here ☺️
god to empty juice from steakcomes back with cooked steak 🤔😉 yeah right
Imagine humans went extinct in the future and intelligent life in the future only has this to prove our existence
It the chicken spent more than 4 hours between 40F and 140F, it was not cooked safely due to bacteria growth.
That machine ain't slapping. its more like punching. Mission fail.
Omg coming back now and seeing a trending video about slap cooking

The added insult to injury way to cook a chicken for a vegan friend. 🙃
POG
I would rather 3D model the MB9001 and then put my chicken in the oven. Fun video.
people from food theory.
This is the future of culinary perfection. Since the steak felt like you’re chewing it for a while it would be perfect for old people in nursing homes who like steak
Why are we studying the properties of cooking a chicken with slaps. Like, humanity has advanced past this. *bangs credit card on table*
I did this, but the chicken starts moaning...
This is so dumb…  Still a nice vid
How many slaps will it take to cook hamburger meat?          Big brain Time

Get ready for the "here from food theory" comments
This guy turned Food Theory into Food Experiment
Good job man, Davie the bass slapper would be proud of you
"Meat beater 9000"  im dead
intense meat beating
MEEEEEE HUNGIEEEEEEEEE
Did the cavemen slap sticks and meat back in the day to make heat and cook their food.
Beautiful
And by chicken, you really mean artificially textured mutant chicken anus
We need to get this to Gordon Ramsay
is this the future of cremation?
Why this video's automatically played when this wasn't even in my recommendation 😳
JD na czacie 9:22
Imagine using that size of a brain to invent a subpar way to cook food. 😂
can't help but wondering what happens if he born in mid century and this device is the one than got invented instead of OVEN . . .
I'm calling B.S. walks out of the room with the steak, swaps it for a cooked one then brings the actual cooked steak back in. Not even close to believable.
You didnt cook the chicken and you probably switched the steak after you pulled it out please tell the truth
"The project was off to a great start" That's always a bad sign
I think the steak is a paid actor
how many slaps does it take to cook a hello fresh meal?
The workable creator cranially phone because stitch counterintuitively nod beside a lackadaisical linen. screeching, obnoxious buffet
Incredible! I still feel like a slapping wheel could work
my question is - you have all material in the world - why the hell would you EVER use a plastic knife and a PLASTIC fork to eat a slapped Steak ?!
9:20 *poland raid*
the meat beater
"I can't talk right now I'm doing hot enby shit" The hot enby shit in question:
Beating your meat has a new meaning
now hire vasilli kamotsky to do it for you
This is why I subed
I think he cooked part of himself long time ago slapping it too much
He said the original meat beater lmfao
I love the passion, it’s not always about the result but the adventure while achieving it!
how the fuck do you ever even ask these question, let alone address the solution
I wonder if you discovered a real purpose for this behind such a stupid thing
So this is where YouTube takes me late at night
I love how the hydraulic press channel weighed in. 😂
Give an engineer free time and money, and you get a Meat Beater 9001 that slaps meat until it’s cooked.  Poetic.
POV : it is  2:26 am and yt recommend this to me
When you take "beat your meat literally"
We will meet again at this exact spot in 6 years.
Phenomenal job We need others to take on where MythBusters left off. I was reading about the toxic environment working for mythbusters group everybody had such personality troubles. Screw them We got our own real live non-sponsored neutral scientists right here on YouTube!!!
It needs some Slap Ya Mama seasoning.
This man was beating the shit out of that meat!
*CHICKEN : Why the hell is that.*
You can tell he watches Mark Rober lol, the only thing different is the voice
Pog
How many chickens where needed to do this? Ando what did you do with the rest of them?
You need to make a paper about this. This is science!
Amazing
Wow
👍👍👍
Davie 504 will love you.
Fire hand
This is why internet was created
I would sure the bolt would mar the beater so you should file the thread on some of it down
Epic dub
This is an innovation of science.
This video doesnt hit right when you know that he didnt actually cook it
Steak, now we're talking
Wow,good job Brother!!! That's awesome. That is a real Slap Chicken. No disrespect My Brother...but i wonder why they called some menu a Jerk Chicken? 🤭✌️😂✌️
10m views and only 400k likes. Idk why people dont just like the video, I like every video I watch
This is how Davie504 cooks his chicken.
The question remains, how HARD would you need to slap it, to cook it in ONE SLAP.
BEAT. THAT. MEAT!
Next time I'm caught slappin some raw chickens cheeks I'll just say I'm cooking it.
Perfect video for Friday night
Few people cook to kill bacteria -- throughout history, anyway -- and even today. Trying to cook a whole chicken with this method is asking too much. A chicken fillet -- or several -- would be far easier.
That poor chicken died for nothing
If it takes 6-8 hours to get up to temperature it is not safe to eat, even if it is "cooked". Even if the bacteria is killed the toxins they release are still present. This is way too much time in the "Danger Zone" temperature range.
Dude,  that thing is screaming moo. Wtf
Einstein who
Add this to the list of things I thought I'd never see
1:00 we need to talk about this table saw... measure distance from that spinning blade to your wrist. don't do that. look at the force direction of your arm, pushing down and away. bad. if your hand or the work piece were to slip, your body should be in a position that it will continue motion in a safe way, away from the blade.
The original meat beater 😂
Stop playing with yourself 🤣
FULL BRIDGE RECTIFIER was getting to hot?
WoW !!!!
11:55 chat XDDD
YouTube algorithm is finally recommending me the important stuff
This same music is used by mark robber
Imagine you were a chicken. Would you rather like to die for this kind of science instead of just beeing eaten?
yo mom would love this machine
I wonder if repeated high pressure  vacuum sealing would work.
The ultimate meat beater.
Uhmm... Not sure how to comment on this... Acomplishment I guess?
So what would it take to cook it in one slap?
I was today years old
Me as a child: I'm never gonna use science in my life This video: Me: 👁👄👁
I don’t like that you stole mark rober’s music and mimicking his type of content
That steak looks disgusting
There youtube, I watched it.
Beating a dead horse? *slapping a dead chicken*
I need to learn how to make that machine
Can someone please show this to Davie504
Davie504 would love this chicken
Hi guys, I'm opening a new restaurant in New York called Slapped my Meat. All our meat are slapped to perfection.  You guys are all invited to my restaurant to eat my meat!
Okay so how many Gibbs slaps would it take to cook a chicken? Instead of an up and down motion, a multiple rubber handed turbine slapper that slaps in revolutions? You could up your sps drastically
You could’ve just started slapping it yourself
This Gives a New meaning...      To "Beating your meat... "
The madman…. He actually did it
Experts say this is the new sous vide
Get a ribeye and do it.

Guga already on this?
arent you loosing energy with al that wood that can move?
Next up: cooking a chicken by slapping it with another chicken
to quote heavenly from russainbager: "if physical energy can be transformed into thermal energy how hard would we have to punch a chicken to cook it"

Louis? are you okay?
This is awesome hot cookin'!  I hope James and Clara helped you over the weekend.  Can't wait to see the new "cold" project vid!
Says vacc chamber is a bad idea. Puts it in vacc bag.
U could’ve just hired someone to be ur personal chicken slapper lol
*I know what we’re gonna do today, ferb!*
You are a fucking legend
Mark rober music
Lol gross! Congrats!
So basically I just watched a slightly entertaining 13 minute commercial for hello fresh
This.. this is why we have the Internet
9:41 he swapped the bags out in the bathroom for another steak that he had already cooked
its all fun in that in till he toke  Mark Rober's music on the intro
*PETA wants to know your location*
Some of your measurements for energy confused me. Watt hours, or just Joules, are fine, but wouldn’t Watts per hour be a bad way of phrasing a measurement considering watts are already a measurement over time?
Now do it with one slap.
I can see why your parents only let you use plastic cutlery.
This makes me wonder, could you cook something using sound waves?
The long fang epidemiologically search because design secondly appreciate above a judicious mile. disturbed, eatable father

What a tool, you didn't eat it?!  Quitter
Most tender meat I've ever seen on youtube
Yes Beat that meat..
Cap
hah he said meat beater
Although I appreciate the effort in the video, i do find it suspicious that he went to the kitchen with the steak ... Still liking, but i do think there is a solid chance the steak was swapped
9:21 Jebać Disa XDDD
*attaches slap warmed chicken to the slaperatus like an extra fleshy flesh light *  Proceeds to f*ck that ho MEAT TO MEAT ! MEAT TO MEAT!……….oh yeah that’s real good
I am actually watching this... What the hell am I doing?
You OBVIOUSLY switched out the damn steak bag when you took the first one into the bathroom... "Dump the juice out" my ass! So lame
"Hey, Barney? You lost the slap bet."
"Meat Beater"  Dude just unintentionally invented a new sex toy for the BDSM crowd...
Yayayayayayayay
MrBeasts brother tried this first lol. It nearly worked but he was actually slapping it.
Episode 2: slapping milk until it becomes butter
Next experiment... how HARD do you have to punch a chicken to cook it...
This guy is my new favourite person in the world
9:39 Plot Twist: he dumped the failed result of the experiment and then replaced it with a steak properly cooked in the kitchen.
season your chicken white boy!
Should have used all steel instead of aluminum with steel reinforcement for the arm- aluminum has very poor strength
I'm in phx, if I want to cook a chicken I set in on the concrete
I can see a new restaurant opening up  The chicken slapppery
McMaster Carr is such a great company and deserves so much love.
Why didn't you use steel for the arm?
Kfc tried this years ago too, actually. But back then colonel sanders just wandered through a chicken coup smackin hens and threatening them if they didnt cook themself. He was fun in his twilight years...
How would you like your steak sir? -Slapped please
I feel kinda sorry for that chicken tbh.
The only question is... Why?
Wtf am I watching 😐
Slapping a steak doesnt cooked it all around the steak u idiot
Lol this is so funny and so awesome at the same time epic video man
Nothing better than a nice piece of Kentucky Slapped Chicken
this is some Michael Reeves shit
Another nessecity to keep the slap power constant was you need to make sure it's the same strength as the average humans full force slap
How does it feel that thousands of people just watched you beat your meat
thousands of years of innovation
Lost of electricity and materials were lost for solving a problem that doesn't even exist. Just turn on your stove dude
I have an energy solution if you use a very high gear ratio system and a high tourq motor you can still get the speed with out all the energy consumption
that chicken was not cooked. it was still pink.
Lol tbh I feel like using f is more appropriate for this project
This is a chicken worthy of Davie504
Chicken should be 87 C.
How he says meat beater is just...
"Real science is done in celsius" -signed, every country that didn't make it to the moon
Truly tenderized cooking
Looks like heavenly got his answer
dude, why the dislikes? You got what you came for.
Can't be the only one getting mark Rober vibes
Isn't real science measured in Kelvin? :-)
co się stało na czacie w 9:21 ?
Sorry if this has already been addressed, but would it not have been more mechanically efficient to use a flap wheel rather than a reciprocating arm?  Would substantially reduce wear and tear on the machine as well as allow you to increase speed with minimal increases to impact force.
I was there from the beginning
Wait what! You ppl don’t already cook ur chicken with a slap machine??? Is it just me or what
That's a lot of electricity
How he's gonna cook food from now on
Imagine you’re dying and your body ends up like this
So it would be more practical if you hooked a meat beater to an exercise bike and did that for 8-10 hours. That way you save the earth. But then again, you’d breathe hard and produce more CO2. So I guess it’s best just to eat raw chicken.
Bro duck it just use lock tite
Absolute unit.
😂😂😂 the original meat beater line was priceless
Arab Moms: "Amatures"
next time you use this DON'T USE CELCEUS use Fahrenheit
Fucking crazy when you stopPed the slap at 69420 it hit 420 here and I took a big old fucking dab for you bro!
Unique 👍
ok in France we have school tests for the last year of high-school and we have to do a "great oral" about what we chose to study, and this morning someone gave a try to his oral during training sessions about cooking a chicken by slapping it. I laughed so hard I couldn't stop and now I'm glad I know it's more or less possible
Took beating meat to a whole new level lol
I hate that the algorithm tried so hard to feed this to me that after ignoring it long enough, my wife ended up getting it and linking it to me. It's exactly what I thought it would be. Dumb contraption to convert friction heat to sous vide a chicken. And he ended up giving up on it. Amazing.
Dont forget to S L A P that like button and C O O K that sub button!
Don’t tell anyone I went on the internet and watched some dude slap his chicken.
Mans is wish mark rober

And from that day everything changed........
Now, sell it for 100 thousand dollars
5:35 hi Louis Weisz
I feel like this guy is gonna figure out how to get infinite energy by slaps
Got lost on the internet. Zgubiłam się w internecie.
Sheesh
Unimmersed sous vid!
lol 69420 slaps
Your a engineer and you choose............smfh
Wait?! I didn't know I had a "question as old as time" that involved slapping a chicken. But, sure enough . . .
Das hünchen wird dir danken dafür das du nach dem tod noch damit herumspielst....
This is what happened to Anthony Davis in that locker room..
Calls Celsius "C" but doesn't call Fahrenheit "F"    WTF? 😆
Wait dude, you forgot to salt the chicken...
That look nasty

The neighbors wr not harmed during the making of this vdo
My mom be like:
The optimal way to cook food. I stand corrected.
Kelvins are used for science lol
yay peter makes an apperance
this is by far the most stupid video i.ve ever seen, beside that, it's astonishing how ignorant people can become for a view likes and views. i don't wanna know how many chickens had to be killed just for this beyond stupid video, i don't wanna know how many people would be happy to just have 1 of those, because they have not the means to buy food.
White people always eats unseasoned and raw nasty food. Whats new lol
We've gone to the moon, explored other planets, discovered genetic engineering, and now we have cooked a chicken by slapping it
Try and try until you succeed
Using this as a "Toy"
Who came up with slapping a chicken and why is this a question that needed to be answered 😂😂
So if I slap my girlfriends but long enough she will start to cook ?
Why does everyone use the same music as mark rober
A real missed opportunity when tasting it to say “Yo this meat kinda slaps!”
Hes speaking the lenguage of the gods
Ok enough YT for today
Nobody: My YouTube recommendations at 3am.
The mark rober music kicked in and I went :o
now we just need a slapping device that helps you poop
I'm sure Davie 504 is watching this  because of the slaps

Someone tell heavenly
i to jd na czacie XD
who toucha my chicken?
It’s terrible how people can get so offended when it comes to human remains being treated without respect..etc but people can show to the world how you can play with chicken meat and slap it til it cooks or most meats in general people don’t think twice of how it was a actually a living thing and is not just some “meat” that I can slap til it cooks because it doesn’t matter that that chicken got wasted and destroyed. All I’m trying to say is that it’s mind blowing how it doesn’t matter if it’s another species what we do to the meat compared if it was human meat people would be freaking out. Whole different view if you were the animal watching.
14k unlikes are from vegans
Adjustable Slap Depth = ASD  hmm
>:( mark rober music theif! ahhhh
That  still live bro
I guess you could say it smacks.
You should of asked Davie504
I am hear from limenade
Huh, so this an engineering version of mark rober.. nice
Oh btw everyy minute in africa 60 seconds pass
You can cook it in half the time if you make another slapper mechanism
Ginawang pinikpikan yung manok
The guys that said” try an oven bud” doesn’t understand what science is and needs to be cooked by the meatbeater 9001
does this mean u can burn one by slapping it
Gotta love budget mark rober
Guys, does anyone know the song name that cues at 7:46 plz?? I know that it's from the Epidemic Sound but that's like looking for a speck of sand in sahara. Ta.
1:05 Meat beater...
Amazing to watch. You should have used steel in your design. There is also a much better system you could use. Look up spring fatigue testing machines to use. Imagine your design but without the arm. You would have a much faster and longer lasting design.
10:25 i was expecting honestly this isnt that bad
Fke
Gordon Ramsay said we couldn’t do it BUT WE DID
The question is, why?
Wait so you saying you were going to eat chicken at 55c.... come one man you didnt cook anything. You slapped chicken to warm. That was not edible.
Meat beater
Is this how Goku cooks food?

Thank you so much for proving the thermodynamics I learned in school is still accurate. This is such an awesome way to take a thought experiment and turning it into a reality
Modern cooking was invented in 1834 *People in 1833:*
more like pounding to me 🤔
You earned this like and subscribe you absolute mad lad!
Impressive man!!  That's really cool how that worked!  Work turning into thermal kinetic energy!
Meat beater lol
I doubt it would be safe to eat.
Turns out that cavemen never discovered fire they all just gathered around a dead deer and slapped it for 3 hours
Why did this end up in my recommended?

How would you like your chicken sir? Fried or roast?  Can I get it slapped?
Isn’t that Peter St House
The only Channel where you can hear the phrase meat beater and it phases no one LOL don't anyone remind me of my childish mind I'm fully aware of it and I'm 27 no ragrets
Davie 504 smiling wherever he is rn
Davie504: Epico!
Just ask Davie504 to slap the chicken
I’ll take 3 of these. Thank you

Russian Badger reminded me to watch this video
Why you copy mr bro huhhhhhhhhhhhh
Imagine dying and geting cooked by slap
That chicken is not cooked my friend aha..
DUDE!! you said the steak was like you've been chewing it for a while right? It's the best way to eat steak as an old person
You’re telling me if I beat it fast enough it’ll cook!!?
How does one not click on this?
all that equipment and plastic utensils
Need that for my meat
My guy took the term beating his meat to a whole new level
some chicken died just  for your   useless  shit
"Yo, let's go!" Is the new dumb guy saying.
Doesn’t count in my books I’ll wait for the real slap experiment done right. Dude boiled the steak.
How many of u came after sun news post
I was skipping to the very end to see what it looked like and I was confused at first coz I saw him put in chicken and then he brought out steak
Those chickens dies for no reason.
Me at 2 AM beating that meat like:
how can he slap?
I wonder what the guy at the store thought when he said "yeah do you guys sell low thermal resistance chicken in bulk?"
Now cook a hotdog with friction
eating a steak that is pretty much mooing at you with that bloody juice
f
Did you season the meats before hand?
Now we know how many times you have to slap a chicken to cook it, but how hard would you have to punch it to cook it?
Akchually for real science you use Kelvin xdd
Would you say the steak “SLAPS” ?
medium rare chicken, lets go
Ladies...please do not take notes
Man rapidly beats his meat at extreme speeds.
That was a very pleasingly placed sponsor ad
The topic of these videos is something I keep my girlfriend awake at 2am talking about. So happy you kept with it and proved it could be done!!

Yeah cool invention and all, but the 420 69 jokes aren’t funny.....and haven’t been since like.....2010. Killed watching the rest of the video for me.
Already knew how that was gonna go you literally cooked the meat by tenderizing it the whole time 😂
Isn't this just the premise of Spaghet?
This is the video we never thought we needed
Mark Rober on drugs

They did say slapping meat is healthy for you.
Why wouldnt you make this way easier on yourself and mount multiple slap paddles to a rotating hub via springs, so you can get multiple slaps in a single revolution?
WHAT AM I WATCHING ?
This channel looks like a mark rober ripoff
"I will slap this chick for scientific reasons."
"OMG. Is this a slapped chicken? Delicious!"
I'm sorry I only have one like to give for this
You guys smoked to much chicken
*like ya cut g* *gets cooked*

dumb way to waste food.
The one's who disliked the video are vegan's
These are the things you can get done if you never get married.
ah tak, jebać disa
Lesson learned, engineers do not click bait
A chicken was harmed in the making of this production.
So to conclude, to properly beat your meat for culinary reasons, you needs the machine to be over 9000.
1:04 The original meat beater also has a fundamental problem.. there was no way whatsoever to control the power... This hit home
Hello Louis. The boys and I just finished watching this video. We came to the conclusion that you should have just used an oven to cook the chicken in the first place. We fail to understand the purpose of this experiment. My friend Vasu feels that you could have accomplished this quicker and easier using a double slapping mechanism. You wasted so much power conducting this experiment, that my house lost power while I watched this video. Thank god I was on my phone during this time, otherwise I would be incredibly upset. Please reconsider your science studies, perhaps you should take a cooking class. They will surely teach you how to use an oven correctly. Your loyal fan, Jeremy. P.S Can you please make a video on how to bake brownies using the same technique, I would appreciate the information.
IS THE MEAT SEASONED IS THE MEAT SEASONED
Next: I Cooked a Chicken by Rubbing It.
🤮🤮
The dislikes are probably from vegans.
okay let´s try with chicken soup
Yet when I choke my chicken I end up hungry
Yeah, but can it go 88mph? Errr...l mean 88'C?
That machine may also cbe able to stomp in shape 20 Snitzels per minute ⚒
Cooking with friction?
All these tests and he still didn't think to season the chicken......👪🏼
I wonder if gordon ramsay saw this video.
WHAT DID I CLICK ON???!!!!I😄😄😄😄
Does he just copiado the whole video technique that Mark Rover uses 😔
It’s 2am and I’m watching some guy using a motorised slap machine to cook a chicken 😂
This is done with "Cigkofte" in turkey.
I like your content, but the sticker "Guns save lives". Realy?
This is insane haha! Man when that arm broke for the 2nd time at the motor I tell ya, I'd be done! Good job though, yay science!
Buddy, you need a welder. No more wood. Use 1/4" steel arm, 1/2" structural bolt (not continuous thread) and it's gonna be skookum
That poor chicken…
I always love these long process science videos. Amazing content man!
Try hard mark rober

I'm just here to read jokes about F***ing machines.  Don't mind me.
Lol he named it the meat beater😅
That’s going to be tender
No chicken were hurt during th.....         Well ...
This chicken’s virginity is gone
This is 100000000000% mark rober’s son in secret change my mind

I tryed this myself but I didn't have any chicken so I did it on my self Bad idea
Ahh hello salmonella
No slapped potatoes?
Spent all that money but can't afford a knife and fork.
U sound like Chris from mr beast
This reminds me of a mix between Mark Robers vids and Micheal reeves ideas
Keep on improving.. you can later on sell the idea to McDonald's, as a new expensive delicacy.
Now you will understand that microwave oven is indeed a great invention..
This was a waste of time.
"guns save lives" = DISLIKE
if a chicken could be cooked by slaps, could it then be cooked twice as fast if the slap arms were stationary and the chicken bounced off of two arms?
This came up in my suggested videos. I love it
The meat beater
Just cook it in the pan man
So my mom tried to cook me back then?!
In less than a year this technology will be at every artisan restaurant and will be the "best" way to cook chicken. The new sous vide.
we don’t cook meat to make it safer to eat. raw meat is perfectly safe to eat. I once ate 6 month rotten meat. Nastiest thing I’ve ever put in my mouth, like a thousand needles stabbing my tongue. When I’d open my mouth I’d fill whichever room I was in with the smell of death. I didn’t die though. We cook meat specifically to make it taste better, that’s it. Raw meat is bland and boring whereas cooked meat with spices is rich and delicious, it’s as simple as that.
Very cool, but the Sub to Pewdiepie sign in the back 😬
Don’t let Davie504 find out about this 👀
Best sponsor integration into fantastically creative content that I’ve ever seen. Bravo.

What about a vibration table? A different form of friction
What’s the point of this ?
man this guys electric bill... fuck
He is so smart and he uses it to slap a chicken
I saw a meme about slapping chicken to cook. I am at peace, knowing the reality of chicken slapping. Thank you.
FUCK hello fresh! So much plastic waste!
Can u do how many slaps to cook a cow?

momento mori anyone?
Random question, but how much does this machine weigh?
Celcius is actually less useful for science because the degrees cover a larger scale. Its less precise without going into the extreme decimals.
make an Air Slapper with a subwoofer
Amazing. I don't know anything about science or engineering but the way you deliver it is so easy to follow that I feel like a physicist myself
Humans really lost  value for life
Tell me you’re bored in lockdown, without telling me you’re bored in lockdown:
CHICKENS watching this : 🤭😳😳
Love that he points out that food can be pasteurized at a lower temp if cooked long enough.  Many people don’t know that but I’ve learned it when learning to cook food via sous vide.
Davie504 APPROVED 👍
Wasting all this energy. You should feel guilty
Bacteria getting murderized by slaps be like: *Oh god please kill me already!*
4:45 It's dangerous to eat raw meat... we should just go vegan.
No excuse for abuse, Let's Go Vegan🍎
Lets face it, mechanical sex machines probably had a lot to do with the inspiration. Slapping, instead of choking your chicken lol

What's up SLAPPERS?
I showed this to people who can’t afford an oven
why don't we put it in the warm bath at 59 degrees and then slap it for a minute to get to 60 degrees.  isn't that what he did?
Overreactions are cringe
Daily dose brought me here
Don't use celcius. Use kelvin like a real man

Felt like Mark Rober video in some way...
Dobrze że ktoś to zrobił :)
O you naughty vegan you.
Plot twist: He switched steaks when he left the room.
Well actually Kelvin is the temperature measure used in science
That is definitely not cooked
Screw celsius and the metric system. Imperial =  BETTER. Metric =SadCauseBad
Seems sus 1:56
In my darkest hour I will think of this and realise we can accomplish great things.
The energy used for the slapping machine could have cooked the chicken like 100x more efficient :'D
It's about time..
Credit to The Goooooose!
Now try cooking it with only one really hard slap
sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesh
Anyone else skips the bullshit in the beginning in the video?
Me and the boys after No Nut November:
I can't stop hearing robers music!
Well slap me silly XD
can train Wing Chun punching or slapoiera slapping style, cooking chicken.

Now this is a adventure
and to think, all you needed was a couple 100w speakers, a spit and a styrofoam cooler covered in duct tape driven around 45Hz.    Welp, I guess we know the next video!
Bruh someone said in the chat, "bro just use a flamethrower"
100,000 slaps in.  "Something still felt off"
I another video I didn’t know existed till YouTube recommended it to me
Lol  Guga Foods missed a tenderizing method
Why is he so annoying?
how did I get here
Yeah, it is 23:30 and I am watching a litteral slapapping-cooking video
How that’s amazing 😅👍
Music name pls
Should have called Davie504.
Another option is to use a Camshaft system with a large contact surface. Basically, like the top end of a car, but on a larger scale. Have a valve spring, and rotates very fast, and is much more reliable.

The rest of the comment is a little +12 so read at your own risk but it's still not to bad I just put this warning here for younger viewers           Why do I want to make a beating my 🥩 joke even if I'm a girl
can you heat a metal container from slapping then the chicken inside, seems a better idea.
Algorithm brought me here.  What a fowl decision.
Damn. Born and raised in a cage. Shocked to death in its prime then its corpse slapped a shitload of times.. what a saga

Just because Celsius is part of the metric system, doesn't mean it's better. In fact, one could argue that Fahrenheit is more precise, because it's in smaller increments than Celsius.

Here's 1 for you. Hans as is the Mongols used to put thin slices of meat between its chest and front legs and allowing friction to cook the meat :) good luck on this adventure and hope to see this on your next video
Misterbeast should slap cook a cicken with his bare hands
This video slaps.
Well, still not satisfifed with the result as you cant eat it without risks
How about we normally cook a chicken?
Seriously, a video titled "I cooked a chicken by slapping it" that made good on the claim of its title. How could you not love this? This needs to be required watching at school.

Hold up. Are you goig to try rubbing it to cook next? Wouldn't that create more heat from chicken? Also might as well choke the chicken.

Someone watched the Russianbadger who asked the same question
Has science gone too far?
Why does the chicken suddenly became a steak?
Me at three am
Keep slapping the chicken 🐔
now, do it with a live chicken
I don’t care about science at all... but I’m liking this video for the effort good job guys!
"I wanted to taste a meal cooked by the power of slaps" *Davie504 wants to know your location*
Glad to see an update 👌
So he didnt cook a chicken, but steak? False advertising...
9:21 czat XD
SHARE THIS VIDEO TO DAVIE504. DO IT. NOW. HE USES THE “SLAP” WORD WITHOUT HIS PERMISSION. IT’LL BE EPIC.
Aaaannnnddd the Internet! 🤣
when u use the same background music as Mark Rober, to sound like him... llmaao
This brings a whole new meaning to “beating your meat”
it's ok youtube, I'm gonna watch this. Now stop suggesting it
Dave504 is proud
No, we don't (just) cook chicken to kill bacteria but so the chicken will be cooked. Y'know, tasty!
girls in their period: "omg my chest grew"  boys in puberty:
14k people need to be punched in the fucking throat for disliking this...
God Bless everyone!!!! Jesus Loves you all very much!!!!
12:00 you can prepare the entire spring onion, just cut off about 5mm from the roots aswell as the brown bits on the green part and you are gucci
This is the first video by this guy and seeing the title I’m just like  “You what?!”
Me needing to do homework: instead watching this guy slapping chicken
Just how many chickens did you beat the sh** out of to get to this point 😆 im crying laughing
This is why i have trust im science
Cool meat smacker
Kinda pissed you didnt say "Honestly, this slaps" but also good for you for resisting the urge to say it🤣
"meat beater 9000" lmaooo
It seems I may have cooked a fair amount of cheeks...
A chicken died..for this
I'm going to go ahead and move on to the next recommended video, which is 'pixie frog poops outside.'
That’s a lot of chicken butt spanking🖐🖐🖐🖐🖐🖐
Davie504 approved
Netflix: Are you still watching?  Someone's daughter:
Which was the biggest overhaul... All MHA fans:🖕🏻him
I lost it around 1:04
Louis Weisz is a walmart version of Mark Rober
Slap like now
We cook meat for two reasons. To kill bacteria as you say, and also to make it taste nicer or at the very least not unpleasant.
Hmmm. Never checked the temp after I’ve slapped my meat. 🤔
Only if our ancestors saw this before fire was discovered
Really cool - but please for the next projects do something without killing animals, even if its for science :--)
congrats man
The steak should have been  tenderized
Если у Реддита будет свой ресторан - эти блюда обязаны быть в меню
My brother thinks I'm watching an educational video but he didn't see the title
Oh my God, you finally did it!
is it just me or !  cause he gois and back wondring if he changed  steak or nah xd last one
Only people with dirty minds would understand 😌 1:05
This is me after my brown mom is done slapping me
NO SHOT u didnt eat it
Mark rober would be proud
Dude took beating your meat to a whole new level 😂
Ayyy don’t think I missed those Mars yards tho 😂😂🔥🔥
I'm glad you revisited this project. I am impressed, lol.

This guy is litterally mark rober with less subs
Mark rober 2.0
why do i get mark rober vibes...
Idk how the hell I ended up here but I'm sure being a line cook had absolutely nothing to do with it...
Nobody:  Chat: *Beat the meat*
Whats your twitch?!?!
HOW IS THIS NOT ON THE GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS!?edit Inb4 the chicken has been booty slapped 69420 trillion times  Davie504 would be proud
*Davie504 has entered the chat*
Are we looking at the future of cooking?
I just slap my wife and she makes the chicken
I feel like a lot of energy is lost in that "piston"
1:18 poor chicken
how about open a restaurant where you can buy slap-cooked meat?
Cook and tenderize at the same time
Mark and Ethan must be INCREDIBLY proud
Nice mark rober music
So, with the insolation he made a "hightec" scify kinetic oven?
This man has done what Unus Annus could not. Memento mori, my friends
Thats it im done with YouTube for the day 🤣
Harvard : You Want Scholarship Bruh !?
What a waste of a Good meat
"chicken"
So before you show the camera the result, you went to another room to "remove the juice".... Sus af!!! hahahaha
Nice. Also its over 9000!
I think you took the problem the wrong way. I'd have attached the chicken to the arm and slammed it repeatedly into something semi-hard, like a slab of silicone rubber. I'm thinking a wheel design would also be more reliable : that back-and-forth motion is clearly too stressful for your machine. You've given me a lot of ideas, though... I might end-up opening a very weird restaurant someday because of you.

This is also how Davie504 cooks his chickens
But Um.. the seasoning? I know that’s not the point but.. the seasoning 🥲
Cocinaste un pollo a la brasa , cool 😎

I think it would be easier if the sloping part was the same heat as a hand

You should put a wide slit in the middle of the wood platform that way the metal arm aint banging itself against the wood part of the machine doesn't wind up breaking itself because it keeps hitting the wood.With recoil and then breaking the metal arm.
You know your in too deep if you clicked on this video
Last video be like:sorry but this video ain’t reality
This is just like an episode of Mythbusters, very well done.
The spooky shame ultrastructurally settle because sunflower modestly rain into a  far-flung note. material, whimsical sausage

Chill on the robbery on Mark robber
Balian deveria assistir esse vídeo
@linustechtips 5:33 bloweeeeeeeeeeeematron.
meh, You shouldn't have cheated with the sous vide ...
Just because you can drive a car with your feet, doesn't make it a good idea.
Are you hashtaging Gordon?
How could you discredit yourself IMMEDIATELY after cooking the steak by leaving the room before putting it on the plate? :( Even IF you cooked it, there is no reason to believe that the steak you put on the plate was the one that was cooked via slaps
All I'd ask is maybe a metal knife and fork
"We will have flying cars in the future". 2021:
Southpark could put this in an episode.
So this is what we got from the corona virus 😂😂
The phase beating my meat has become a reality
I really just watched a video about some guy beating his meat smh
This is my next oven
Nice felt you shouldnt have went to the bathroom cause people might think you switched it out
Hahaha hydraulic press channel comment
Who knew beating meat was so epic?
Dislike for Celsius = science
“Sir..Sir!”  Grab me that meat beater   “But Sir it’s dangerous”  Grab ME that meat beater
I have one quibble, pasteurization =/= cooking. Cooking breaks down fat and collagen and denatures proteins, which is what causes cooked chicken to be a solid white instead of a translucent pink. Your chicken looked pasteurized but not cooked.  Good job on the steak though, very cool video overall!
Do it with a live chicken
Well...  1  Clickbate  2 using the same Mark rober  techniques and his background songs ..
He said meat beater lol
His voice sounds like autotune 😂
Mark Rober 2.0
I really support this new humanity invention but we need some seasoning next time
The master of beating meat

This is the kind of content that makes YouTube awesome. Kinda like what you would see from its earlier days
chicken in heaven: This is what we died for?
This is why The Rock always asks if you smell what the rock is cooking? As he backhand slaps all his opponents to kingdom come
I was suggesting a spring to counterforce the chicken slaps, which is the reason why the motor bolt breaked the slapper shaft from the upper part. But what the hell, you nailed it man! CONGRATS. *should've seasoned it tho, since slapping would put seasoning far insider the meat than even sous vide method*
Wtf u mean im the original meat beater
My physics teacher put this video on our Teams chat
How can anybody search this video up and decide to dislike it?
Does anybody recognize his voice sounds like m.beast in the intro
9:21 only Polish ppl will get it
Nikt: Polacy: jebać disa
Heat is just vibrations so makes sense
How many slaps of a spoon to melt your heroine
Saw this on ig. had to look it up. 😐
I hope Mark Rober does his over engineered version of this with aeroespacial grade materials
I remember seeing this on another channel……which is no more……
This guy is a mix of mark rober and mrbeast
Doesn't count until you actually eat a piece of the slap cooked chicken lol
Collaborate with Guga Foods
Imagine vegans reaction to this
We did it boys
Came from Instagram meme🖐🏻😭
Davie504 approves
OGs remember the meat beater 9000
Meat beater 9001   Ah yes a true man of culture
Davie504: *Approved*
People spamming f when something breaks down XD
Who needs ovens if you have slaps

Why didn't you use a paddle wheel with rubber paddles?
The meat slapper will melt metal befoee cooking the damn chicken 😂
Haha I am pleasantly surprised to have closure.  🤣 love that Hello Fresh sponsored a video where you slapped a chicken 👌
I'm very surprised that you have a 10 degree difference in cooked meat compared to the UK, here, for commercial kitchens to legally serve meat, it has to reach 82/83 degrees C to be considered cooked.
It’s neat how he uses the same music as Mark Rober
Why can’t you already get 5000000 subs you just did god favor
"In terms of chicken integrity" lmao
How high must you drop an egg to cook it?
I love hello fresh
Now how long do you have to choke the chicken to cook it
Kelvin, not celsius
I really hate that he keeps saying "C" instead of Celsius
IF YOU HAD SLAPED IT WITH  SOMTHING FLEXIBLE YOU WOULD HAVE COOKED BY SLAPPING, YOU HAVE ACTUALLY SMASHED THE MEAT NOT SLAPPED. I SUGEST TRYING AGAIN WITH LEATHER OR FLEXABLE PLASTIC WILL WORK BETTER AND THEN I CAN WATCH YOU EAT SLAPPED CHICKEN.
JUST FOR THE RECORD, the original question involved punching not slapping... Just wanna put the idea of a robot throwin haymakers at a raw chicken into the minds of the comments
Imagine you are the chicken that got killed just to get cooked by the Power of slaps😂😂
The only way I could optimise this was testing the temperature of the components as the time went on.
The greatest movement of our generation can you cook a piece of chicken by slapping it
meat beater tehee 1:05 only dirty minded people will git it
I now appreciate PWM more than ever before.
yep, this so obviously failed, you need 74 degrees to actually kill harmful bacteria
Is ‘slapping your chicken’ anything like ‘beating your meat?’
Finally someone who doesn’t use fairenheight
Aaagghh come onnn. You gotta do it again and pull it out and eat it....
Celcius is for communists.   + Quite frankly.. the whole decimal system is a logic plague on mankind. Base 12 is clearly a more versatile. Computer programmers figured out the utility of hexadecimal 50 years ago.
What's the worst way to die? Being burned to death? Technically, but not quite.
Mythbusters may have ended years ago. But YouTube videos like these carry that torch perfectly
How do you want your steak  Me:Slapped
I just want to say this in the name of the entire Internet: We are SO proud of you!
Him: its started Meat: harder daddy Him: what? Meat: ...
Props for the Mark Rober vibes cuz of the background song
Just...........why?
excuse me? kelvin is what real scientists use lol
Haha... He said "Meat beater". Lol
This the type a shit I love YouTube for. Insanely awesome tbh!
this will be in histoy
Now it’s time to cook an egg by slapping it.
I volunteer for the next steak test 🥩
I slapped my wife,  she is now well done.
Someone send this to @davie504 who slaps that bass all the time.
funny but waste of time
6:39 me at 2am......
how did i end up here
Just wanted to tell you how annoying your voice is. Exaggerated high pitch noises ugghhh
Aliens: "We have learned to harness dark matter as an infinite energy source, well done!"  Humans: "We invented an automatic slapping machine for the purpose of slapping our meat! Well done!"
YES TO THE YES
Most important question?🤔 did you season the chicken??
meat beater
davie504 could've cooked it with just one slap
When "beatin the meat" gets a whole new meaning
Davie504 would love this

I need your patience! So nice
Boil water now
David 504 - "*OMG*"
Does he steal that background music from mark rober?
My mom always told me "Don't make me slap the black off you." This man slapped the fuckin salmonella off of chicken.
What the actual f**k have i not only watched but also been completely entertained by
You forgot to say: "I know it doesn't look that good right now. But watch this!" ;)
+1 like for using the (ultra superior and not obsolete) metric system 👍🏻
Ahhh... Content
YOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!! LET'S GOOOOO!!!!!!! EVERYTHING ELSE I SAY IS ALSO IN CAPS BECAUSE THIS ATTRACTS THE MARKET AUDIENCE I THINK I MOST CLOSELY APPEAL TO LETS GOOOO!!!!!!
Real temperature measurement is done in K!! not F or C :P lets be real scientists here!!!
Davie504 would cook the chicken in 3 minutes
Plot twist, the room temperature in his room was 60C all along...
this dud stole the Mark Rober music.
awful video.
If this guy implemented his engineering commitment to solving climate change we'd be saved in a week
Larry could cook this in 3 seconds just search up “The slap part two”
1:55 😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩

This is probably the most energy inefficient way to cook a chicken. Hahha.
You know he's legit when he uses the same theme song that Mark Rober uses
You did it you crazy sob, you really did it
Dude hello fresh is a rip off my guy
“This is scientific” *takes picture of 69,420 slaps
Davie504 scribbles down some notes- Don't slap bass solo for not overcooking the meat...
5 million years later: I cooked a chicken with sound
5 minutes craft how to cook be like:
Didn’t actually see you eat the chicken but alright
anyone here after LAD Bible's post?
Send this to Gordon Ramsey 😂😂
This is like mark Rober but idiots version
Well people,  that's it. We've officially done everything.  Time to shut down the internet...
taste the meat, not the heat
Omg i thought this is some bullshit at first..
I bet that slaps
no one: literally no one: Davie504: *EPICO*
But why. Realy WHY!!! Still enjoyed watching some good meat slapping.
unus annus tried, this mate succeeded.
I'm subscribing just because you used Celcius
Lol that guy has way too much free time
His friend:  "So... What did you do this Quarantine?"  Him: "I've been beating meat" :>
Yo your literally another mark Robert he uses the same music as you did, and he does basically the same stuff but slightly more well..fun I’ll put it that way
Title: "I Cooked a Chicken by Slapping It" "Davie504 has entered the chat"
Now slap me a live chicken roast
Why no design like paint mixer?
HE. NO. SEASON. STEAK. * hurblrughgg *
Imagine waiting this whole video to watch a guy eat a slap cooked chicken and just getting shafted with an ad at the end
Didn't expect to watch a guy beat meat on youtube.
>"the texture is kinda shit" "it's a really bad steak"  >"with the steak being a resounding success..."  Bruh
2:18 Fahrenheit is far more precise.  But, I guess if you're just slapping a chicken, how precise do you really need to be.
Peter Sripol?
Anybody else notice the Mark Rober music in the start? Is that a stock track available through editing software or something?
Bro idk this YouTuber but I feel like I learned a lot more then I could ever had in school
Should have done it with a machine that shakes it and has 2 points of impact. More even cooking 🤣
Meat beater...
So that game Spaget is true?
Drugs are bad.
Vegans: ThAt pOoR ChIcKeN iS bEiNg AbUsEd!
That is truly amazing...But why? WHY would you do that?
I bet you Davie504 could slap it and cook it before your little toy could
This is nothing new, Davie504 cooks all his meals like this.
*I really got to think twice before beating my meat now..*
subscribed because of your VCDL sticker!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
my first thought for the brainstorm was to use a belt and motor to rotate a big wheel with many hands lightly slapping it at high speeds
SEASON YOUR EXPERIMENTAL MEATS PLEASE YOU DESERVE FLAVOR
This thing slaps
I think the matcine should have been named after completion. As its gone from MB9001 to MB9001.1 to MB9002.1
Gordon ramsey watching this:  WAIT WHAT?!
It’s the mark rober music!
"tastes like you've been chewing it a minute already, but if you can get past that..." xD
*Girls sleepover* -Im hungry lets order some food  *Boys sleepover* -I just finished slapping the chicken, who want some?
F
Cop out .. ending
Ok recommendation, you win
I mean, real science is 'done' in kelvin
Me watching this for a school assignment 👁👄👁
Holy hell. You just sous vide'd a chicken by slapping the shit out of it.
The only series that matter to me now lol
@davie504
This man makes talking smart sound stupid
Its called meat beater... I still beat my meat faster. I mean slap
I see... new life hack found guys. If youre ever stranded and hungry with just an uncooked chicken. Start slapping really fast
1000% bullshit
👀 MEAT BEATER 9001
Or Just put it in the oven
All machine sistem : forged steal  Eatting tools : plastic  Me: pathetic
This is a good Lesson..All School should be having this in the Science Course in the future instead of Doing some experiment on frog.
Couldn't you have attached paddles to the engine directly instead of making your contraption so fragile? If you got the angle right, went for more, softer slaps at a higher frequency, and fixated the chicken, it could have gone way smoother probably.  Still, very nice concept and love the progress you made on this. You've more than earned those views and likes ^^
*they called me madman...*
Somehow i thought im watching a MrBeast Video
Plot twist. It was all a hello fresh commercial in the end
Meat beater Lol 😂
meat beater 9001 does it work with human meat?
STOP Trying so hard to sound like Vertassium...
Heads up guys (pun intended) don't beat your meat too much.
POV you are the chicken being repeatedly being slapped by a machine
We cook food to kill the bacteria in it? You mean to say that if somehow there wasn't any bacteria we'd eat the meat raw for example? Cause I don't see this happening.
This man took beating his meat to a whole other level
I mean, its just the same as mcdonalds nuggets
Use tungsten the worlds strongest metal in earth you use it that the hand doesn’t broke
Colab with Guda foods when? I'm sure the experiments you both do would be great to see
I'm not a chicken but why my mom keep slapping me
This video convinced me to follow you. 😆
If this were true I would have cooked my pecker years ago.
He deadazz called it the Meat Beater 🤭🤣
Back off guys... He's about to beat the meat
Sous vide out, slap in!
The flash will never need to use a oven ever again u.u
Thank god I was born at the right time to see something this legendary. Just wondering why a lot of those “what you missed because of Clovis” isn’t including this in their lists.
meat beater sounds wrong on SO MANY LEVELS
>celebrates 69420 slaps this man knows his audience
That chicken slaps bro
The madlad... He did it.. he finally did it.
Davie504 approves.
Me on dec 1
*salt bae heavy breath*
So this is how to make slapped chicken?
I heard choking it also works well but there’s usually a mess to clean up when it’s done “cooking”
1:04 great choice of words “meat beater”
Also doubles up as an obscure torture device
I knew it.
Can you make the stake burnt?
This is probably a Davie504 approved dish. 😂
Mark Rober collab???
Man really took “ beating your meat “ to a whole new level.
Good job man - quite the slapparatus 😂 I’d love to help out with the engineering on one of your future projects. Feel free to hit me up 🙂
that's undercooked....

This guy just demonstrated a whole new way to cook👏👏👏
Davie can cook it with only one SLAP.
Clickbaited
If you go to brews video on slapping chicken until cooked, he tells you that this was all a lie. He did not cook it. He didnt eat it because he didnt cook it thoroughly so I am just telling you guys that
My hand does this everyday
Davie504 here come new challenger
Real science is in Kelvin
If you're American, why are you giving measurements in Celcius?
Mark Rober Music L0l
Davie must be proud bout it
You fucking god damn did it
Congratulations dude!!
im british and we dont call farenhight  degres
LOL usually when people cook things they add spices and salt and that’s what gives the majority of the flavor so I could see why it tastes strange lolol
The moment that music started playing and started to get into detail of the design I felt like I was watching a mark rober video
Season the meat and hit with a blow torch after slapping. Might change the game a bit.  Just think of the slapping as a new type of sous vide, instead of a fully finished product. I think you could get better results.
Imagine using fires and ovens.    - This post was made from slap gang.
School nuns: hold my bible
Davie504 aprobe this
Mark Rober who?
I've said a lot of things in my life but just ate something off the slapper has unfortunately not ever been one of them.
saitama slap will help all the trouble you have slap the subscribe for ur genuine video
You straight up remind me of the dude from cloudy with a chance of meatball with the steak was cooked 😂
Gordon Ramsay needs to see this lol
“So it’s basically a machine that automatically beats your meat” Hol up
I feel so honored to have my very own piece of meat-beating history. Very cool to see your presentation of all the experimentation I've been seeing in the shop! Thanks again for the bolt and I can't wait to see what's next.
What am I watching
Oh my
My mom asked my why I was slapping my meat so much
It needs spices
me : contemplating my existence YouTube: here's a dude who cooks a chicken with slaps me: 😐
He looks like a young Mark Ruffalo
Meat
Louis, I got to be honest with you. I see you have potential to be a record breaking engineering channel. However, I gave this a thumbs down because the final product was a steak. Very disappointing clickbait. I loved the whole vid until the steak ...
Next time just rub your meat really hard instead of slapping it
Imagine Bobby Flay shows up for a Throwdown
Jesus
Finally a way to slap those cheeks
That strong arm is really beating the meat
so stupid
Davie would be proud
Mark Rober music with Mark Rober style talking... Wow...
My good friend Parker Ormonde is the one who originally brought a massive amount of light to this by doing the physics calculations to find out if you could and what it would take to do it!
jebać disa
Instead of chocking the chicken my mans slapped it😏
I feel like that steak should be tender as all hell
Finally some good fucking food
-The steak tastes good. Salt and pepper on the spice rack: :/
This absolutely chad. Round of hand slaps for him! **claps**

@davie504
If that many slaps would cook any meat then my * member * should be well done.
This gives a whole new meaning to “beating meat.”
MEAT BEATER!
I Dont Need Sleep, I Need Anwsers
I could have gone through my whole life not needing to know if I could cook a chicken with slaps
I have a blowy-matron too but she doesn’t like when I call her that
*slap*
Why isn't anybody saying anything related to Davie504?
Plot twist: I cooked a chicken by cooking it.
Imagine being the animal that died just to be slapped until human consumption
I can’t believe I just watched a 13min video about slapping a chicken
'Meat Beater'  Sir... Sir!
Really took tenderized to a new level
This idea was probably brought to fruition by the heat generated by a different type of meat beating. Aka - sock babies.
Because of the slapping davie504 should like this video
esta wea es el peor video que he visto a medias.
> 8 hours >130F / 55C > Yep that's safe to eat> Man dies of projectile salmonella
Imagine dying as a chicken for food but then you get slapped until you’re cooked lol
How many vegans has this man made livid

If it takes 135000 beats from the meat beater to cook a chicken, how much beats do you require to cook a cock?
9:22 JD
Where is Davie504?
technoblade!!!! 0:17
finally
Davie504 cooking chicken:
I like the Mark Rober music in the background. He also speaks just like Mark. Is this Mark's secret brother?
The near moat chiefly tip because screwdriver natively reject until a slow equipment. harmonious, fallacious roast
*Davie504* will be so proud if you used *Bass* for this
you got featured in daily dose of internet :D
R u really wearing Mars yards working in a workshop?.....owww.......my head........
Anyone notice that he used some of Mark Rober’s background music
Hey Peter scripol
Never thought I'd watch a video of a man beating his meat!
if meat is not white its raw for me
offbrand mark rober
Show this to Davie504
Nice and tender
I'm lost at youtube
What if you try making real stone minecraft tools video. If you want to see if it is possible..
Science biiittcchh!! 😅😂
What about a monkey?
All it took was 1 slap meme to turn it into reality lmao 😂
how tender was that steak tho?
Your like bootleg mark rover.... I like it👍🏼
Hey guys this is simple thermodynamics, calorimetry
Petition to change the video title to: Louis Weisz aggressively beating his meat.
'Florida Man imitates YouTube creator, builds "Meat Beater" chicken cooker, dies from Salmonella poisoning. More at eleven'.
Davie504 is not impressed.
"it tastes like you've been chewing it for a minute already. Sir, you slapped that meat 34000 times
'pretty new to cooking myself' *cooks chicken with the power of slap*
Bruh
I looked up how to make sweet n sour sauce...this man is spank cooking a chicken...
You could’ve just slapped it in the oven
See and they always said hitting things would never solve a problem. If I can’t cook a chicken I’ll just slap tf out of it problem solved
Bruh, you cheated by preheating and that shit is still cold as fuck. Water evaporates at 100 degrees Celsius. You can't even call that cooked. Would be better if you didn't had to make some bullshit claim and just admitted that even though you did your best you still couldn't make it. Also, hidraulic press channel actually made a good suggestion by telling you to put it in actual vacuum and you claimed it was just bad.
Who else is here from "Daily dose of internet?"
I did this to my hip with a massage gun :|
This man is literally nothing without Peter. I hope Peter is charging rent.
Massive load of shit - leaves room - camera cuts - and then returns with perfectly cooked steak. If it's one thing that Magic acts and general video editing teaches us, it's that if there is a single cut, then everything is void due to infinite amount of time being available between stops. So even if this was somehow legit and not just a meme race, the cut has made it unprovable. Unfortunate editing.
This is just white people undercooking and not seasoning chicken featuring science
Video title: Chicken The video: Stake
Oh my Ghad,  where did this guy get that much brain cells.
I didn't notice it was Celsius and I was like "Why is he so happy about 60°??"
Why your studios look like petersripol studio?
no flywheel or gear box ?? i mean so much energy is applied to the parts you could have had a flywheel and gears ratio to to run the motor slower and have the same splap per minutes i think this is one underengineered rigs you want some energy to be transfererred and no offense but you could have done it like even faster with less current if 1 a flywheel conserved some of the rotation energy and 2 gears downs from the flywheel to high speed without reciprocating movements.
Why don't you ask Komatskiy to do it?
So is “slapping the chicken” code for something? Bahahahaha
me at the end of november: 9:19
What a milestone
This music... This one wants us to get Mark Rober vibes 🤔 But don't be fooled folks!
Hello everyone this your daily dose of internet
Actually all you need is just davie504
the all knowing YouTube algorithm has guide me here

@davie504
You know the video is good when mark rober background music is in it
Tán để nó nóng lên tự chín à =))
That’s rad. Now the next time mom asks why I’ve been in the shower for 30 minutes, I can tell her I’m cooking my chicken.
Davie504 is that you ?
Congrats, your on daily dose of internet
Screw your Celsius now I have to pull out the Googles every two minutes ugh USE BOTH
Now make a restaurant that serves only food cooked by slaps
It's a lever with a hammer on it.
My mum and sister are both having an important argument about a movie they are watching and here I am... 😂
Yeah cool science but that animal died for nothing
How did the steak brown so evenly? I've sous vide cooked steak before and it does not brown like that from low and slow cooking..
8:12 kicks on feet 👀🔥
YOU DID IT YOU MADMAN
People in 1950: “in the future we’ll have hover cars and communicate through telepathy!”  2021: must...slapp....the.....chicken
Me seeing tittle Me as a future millionaire: How much do you want for it?

Great, now try cooking pizza with nuclear weapons
I actually thought this is Davie 504 related

"I cooked a chicken by slapping it!" 9.2 Million people: 👁️👄👁️
I like how you showed the whole process and some extra bits by doing the steak and putting in the same video .
9:21 Jebac disa xdd
No chickens were harmed during the making of this video
The sequel is here! My life is complete!
I have no idea why am I watching it
You should have called Davie604
90's : maybe in the future there's a flying car 2021: how to cook a chicken by slapping it
The thumbnail looks like it's karate chopping the chicken instead of slapping. I'm also disappointed the real slapper isn't actually hand-shaped.
*After tasting the chicken* I guess you could say that this shit slaps.  *Puts on sunglasses* YYEEEAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!
*Davie504 wants to know your location*
"They called me a madman" -Thanos
Good good now make it where the chicken is delicious
Ok now, step on it now -Parents wanting more
Could have have collaborated with Davie504 and his army of slappers
wish i had this much money and time
You need to tell Guga about that findings.
you should've called Davie504!
Davie would approve this.
SLAP LIKE NOW
My mom slapcooked my ass once or twice.
"FDA guidelines" mans gonna make a full on restaurant that serves slapped chicken
The slapper 2K just have your baby in the slapper and ther you go LOL
The fuck am I doing with my life
Indians here ?
Next, can you cook an egg? Also, real scientists use Kelvin.
Next,try to cook with fire...u might surprise with the result.
The meat beater heater
I’m calling Gordon Ramsay
They answered 96.5 FMs Shrooms question bro
In the days of Leonardo da Vinci they would have just got and actual hand from a dead guy
Because that’s... what heroes do
"That's the scale used for real science"  Nah man, shoulda used Kelvin. Would be *ultra* legit.
If YOU feel comfortable to eat chicken(!) that has not been heated beyond 100°C...please, go on. I prefer my steak well well done and my goose in the oven for 2h 180°C. But, yeah, take your chance...
Jello’s prayers have been answered
This guy is like Mark Rober on crack
I love how you are literally budget mark sober
i think maaan just cook the chicken in the oven, yet here I am whatching the video hoping that he SLAP THE FUCK IT TO DEATHHHH !!
Anybody else hear mark rober music
Celcius is for amateurs. Real scientists use the Kelvin scale.
Fam for the mars yards 2.5 🤨
Beat the meat. Beat the meat. Beat the meat. Beat the meat. Beat the meat. Beat the meat. Beat the meat. Beat the meat. Beat the meat. Beat the meat.
"Engineering"
SLAP LIKE NOW
"Meat beater"
First time ever anyone's actually used the suggestion of beating their meat to mean cooking food. :D
Cooking isn’t just killing bacteria, it also is denaturing proteins. You can do both of those with lower temps for a long time, but for instance irradiating the chicken may only make it sterile but it wouldn’t necessarily affect the protein.
Davie504 approves this video
This dude said “Meat beater”
Grab me that MEATBEATER!!
Daily Dose of Internet sends his regards.
Why are you like mark rober 2
Imagine dying just to get slapped 100k times
Anyone else notice the slight diss to the hydraulic press channel? Lmao
Really brings a new meaning to beating your meat
Me when it's night time and no one's awake🤜🥩
That's one way to beat your meat

Wtf are you doing man eating raw chicken may kill you
Davie504: "OMG!"
Dude, why are you eating with picnic utensils? 😂
yo if you can cook a chicken by slaping it..does it mean every time you get smacked you get cooked a lil bit😂
THIS is why you hire German engineers for things to work. No offense, but it is hilarious how much broke...

pretending the "let's eat it" from the beginning was for the chicken seems a little clickbaity but still kinda cool.
Hey Louis I'm just curious If you can really create the functional ODM from Attack on Titan

He took beating meat to a whole new level...😳
You can say the steak is high
YEAH ENGINEERING!
Yessss
Sorry, not watching your vid since it’s in Celsius
Tell me that all of us came here to see meat beating lmfao💀
Memento Mori my friends 😔
Try cooking one by choking it next time
In germany they would flay this guy alive for wasting these chickens....but I like it
Cant believe people fall for this
Nobody tell Davie504
Bro called it the meat beater 🤌🏾
Davie504- slaps bass Louis- slaps chicken
This is what the internet was made for
https://youtu.be/G-rMPc8JUnk
I will only eat chicken at a restaurant if they slap it now. This is new high end dining.
we choose to go to the moon in this decade
like how you took this idea from mr.bro
Chickens died for science.
umm sir 'tHe OrIgInAl MeAt bEaTeR ?' 👀
Too much arm distance. Decrease the slap distance
Wow, Great job!!!!!!!!!!!
Best paid promotion in a video ever!  Perfect synergy and hilarity.
I would have a doubt about an issue that came up during one of the most stupid discussions one could imagine between friends: a human body of 1 meter and 85 centimeters, about 120 kg, if closed inside a car hood, then the car inside how many others Can existing vehicles / aircraft enter? (example: car inside the train, train inside a container, container on the plane, etc. etc.)
THE MEAT BEATER
He sounds like Bobby plays from Codm
Este vato cocinó un filete a chingadazos
Marshall Eriksen could cook that chicken with only one slap
Ohhhh the innuendos...but I lowkey want a spanking machine. 😈

Yeah you took the steak off camera to take it out of the bag.
Vegans going crazy if they saw this* HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
imagine getting killed only to see that your corpse getting slapped to hell
Mark Rober parody lmao. Genius.
if I am in the forest and there is no fire, then I will definitely prepare my own food in this way
Answer : a lot slaps
the people who disliked are vegan
where is davie504?
My boy even made a new measure, SPS, slaps per second...

For you see, I'm sure he likes to watch Let's Game It Out. At 0:36 you can see on the right hand side of the screen showing two of Let's Game It Out's video. "I Built An Airport of Suffering Where Nobody is Safe," and "I Built a Raft That Defies Reality and Ignores Physics."
Perfect sponsor and great Segway
1930: were gonna have flying cars in the future   2021: I slapped a chimkin and ate it
To be fair the steak's texture wasn't that great because you beat the shit out of it like you needed its lunch money
And that's why I want to be a engineer!
Why doesent my girlfriend get cooked?
anyone else get mark rober vides?
Cutting a steak with plastic utensils feels like a sin. This man is beyond the rules of humanity
1:20 why does mark rober’s iconic music make anything watchable
When you’re on YouTube and it’s 1:00 am:
Bro you didnt cooked it. If you really cooked it you would had the confidence to eat it. Redo it, or its a fail admit it
Well then I guess I cooked my wife...
David504 will approve this video. The power of slap!
Date: so what do you do for a living?  Louis: I see if I can cook chicken by slapping it.   😂
Waste of my time he didn't even fully cook it by the power of slap 🤦‍♂️
This guy sound like mr. beast .
You put the steak in the bag raw (and red). You take it out of the bag cooked with a perfect brown color evenly distributed around the whole thing by hitting it in one spot? I don't think that's possible. That's been seared in a pan or similar.
Me in the bed- Patethic
What a time to be alive
this is the kind of science that REALLY matters

I'll have my chicken well slapped
Gordon Ramsay:ITS STILL FUCKING RAW ITS STILL RUNNING!!
Well done.   "For science"
Slap Chop is definitely jealous of this video.
I've seen the meme but I did not think it was possible.
12:23 I found it hilarious and couldn't contain myself for some reason after reading that
He just beets chicken's meat 😳
Memento Mori
i dont know why i laughed so hard when he said meat beater 9001
Builds a machine to beat meat cooked... but eats with plastic silverware, hm k. I could make a guess where you live... :D
You have a New Restaurant Idea "The Slap Kitchen" Or "Beat Your Meat Kitchen "
Waiter: What would you like to order sir?  Him: I would like a chicken... *slapped* chicken.
1. That is NOT "medium rare". Too much blood. It's "rare" at BEST.  2. *ORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORA*
Algorithm suggest, I watch!
Now get Gordon Ramsay to season it and eat it
Isn't the FDA's clasification for um cooked chicken 74 degrees? and you just showed us the thighs and wings's statistics
#Davie504 The power of Slap is real. SLAP LIKE NOW
JEBAC DISSA
very ethical dont choke on it
Davie504 approoves this test
So now that you have proven you can completely cook a chicken with slapping I think the obvious question is if you can take one to completion via choking.... I hate myself for this.
He leaves the room with the meat, he could have exchanged it at the time.
*they called me a madman*
У меня только один вопрос: что тебе курица сделала?

Why did the chicken crossed the street?   Because it was FU%&$%# RAW  Gordon Ramsay
Chicken: "Ah. I can finally rest in peace...  ...ayooo wth?!"
People no more ovens
They did it. Something that Unus and Annus never could. Props to you my good sir👏👏👏👏👏
I should call her
For a machine like this I would recommend putting the near motor part which broke all the time completely in some common cheap Gearbox oil and made from forged iron, iron for flexibility and hardness, and weight... it's not just about the speed, slap it harder. Motors and everything else should have some cooling system with a coolant pump and so on... The reason everything broke was because of hot and cold parts, and no material withstands the heat and vibrations this machine took. Hot and cold areas made the materials crack, lower the heat and together with all moving parts at the same temperature, with the gearbox oil. It'll will prevent all of this mess that happened.  You got all of these parts and yet you don't have proper thick grease for this thing to at least have some chance to survive? It was like a washing machine on steroids when it comes to vibrations, no material has a chance. Plus... why so big? Make it smaller... would make a giant difference.
Would a person survive the slapping? Would a human be cooked by the slappings?
When putted in the machine=🐔 When he slice it=🥩
Cooking is not pasteurisation. Cooking is breaking proteins to make them easier to digest.
YouTube recommended this video to me. The system is working again!
I te jebać disa jak jest 60 stopni

Now that is science. You've earned my subscription, sir.
How is that chicken meat brutha
Just put in in a oven
...except you didn't.
This dude is hhahah
I feel like I'm apart of history.
So we're just going to ignore "the original meat beater"??
I feel like a steak slapped to perfection would be great
Most suprising part: YOU'RE SPONSERED.
Well guess I'll start slapping from now.
I want to buy this for um personal usage
Bone in chicken 185.
ok but pasteurizing and cooking are not the same thing... Cooking food isn't just about killing the bacteria, it alters it chemically to make it more tasty
Engery can't be created nor be destroyed in a chemical reaction
Spoil alert      *I T ‘S  F A K E*
The new slap fryer.
That thing isn't cooked at all
1:05 His talking about you
Gonna disagree with the cooking logic. High heat serves dual purposes.... You want to kill the germs, sure, but the best flavor comes from the maillard reaction, which would, in the case of this chicken, require significantly higher temps for a shorter time. ~300F. I would suffer bacteria before I suffered....that....mess. Regardless, you should get like an internet award for this.
God, it just pulls you in... I was almost 2 minutes into the video before I had to stop and ask "where the fuck am I?"
It would be hilarious if this winds up being the groundwork for the greatest cooking innovation since the microwave.
Show this to Gordon Ramsay
I bet it's tender.

Ah yes, this is youtube
Her: I wonder what he’s thinking about.   Him: preventing burns while spanking the meat formula- Speed of sound c ≈ 331.3 + (0.6 × ϑ) in m/s. That gives e.g. at a temperature of ϑ = 20°C a speed of sound of: c ≈ 331.3 + (0.6 × ϑ) = 331.3 + (0.6 × 20) = 343.3 m/s.
But feirheniet
Can you make the hand into👌🏾?
10:37 Dude, it's a steak! Even before the slapper treatment, it would have tasted awesome if you are into raw meat.
lol you didn’t cook a chicken this is just a lie
Actually in science temperature is measured in Kelvin, not Celcius.
So this means i have to take it a bit slower when having sex??

Where's the vegan community
Gà kiểu t chết r cũng k yên
yo, Brew just made a video proving that you didn't actually cook the chicken yet... it was still super impressive.
According to a coffee drinking man on youtube, you didn't cook the chicken well enough         That coffee drinking man, for all those who dont know, is known on youtube as Brew, he does researchy science things.
I'm back to watch this after watching Brews video critique
He definitely got an A+ in STEM
Hey just watched brew video and I’m not sure what to think. I want to believe it’s real but I’m just not sure. Does anyone who knows more than me confirm if it real?
When you realise he just bought a cooked chicken and threw out the raw chunk of meat he absolutely failed to cook.
But, Brew did debunk your video..the chicken wasn't actually cooked.,
When restaurants ask me how I like my meat, I say SLAPPED!!! Then they ask me to leave...
are you Mark Rober???
No, the chicken was not cooked, it takes a bit more of knowledge to understand that it wasn't, like Brew showed, but are we seriously going to ignore that he did in fact cook the  meat.
https://youtu.be/2LuB3f_ecH4 here what you need to know it was not cooked
Imagine this is fake because this is really realistic
The MB could also stand for something that’s related to beating meat    MALICIOUS BONDING
Anyone here from brew video?
You guys know the YouTuber “brew” go check out his YouTube channel he addressed this and said it was fake, just thought you might like to check it out.
I was born with two meat beaters, they make my meat pretty tough... you could say my meat would get rock hard.
My gf: I’m home alone  Me:
Bitch u got sirpol on this 💀 nice 👌
@Louis Weisz so what really happened? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LuB3f_ecH4&ab_channel=Brew
People who suggest Celsius and aren't scientists please leave the comment section.
https://youtu.be/2LuB3f_ecH4  Your video was debunked here
Liar
The changeable call exceptionally interest because defense rarely earn onto a holistic mountain. attractive, selective middle
Bruh, Brew is dissing you.
Unus annus anyone?
this video refused to get out of my recommended so I finally decided to watch it.
Chicken Plate Armor sounds nice tho. I want to see this
The original meat beater, hahaha, don't judge me
No you didn’t
Please tell me I'm not the only person that watched this because of Unus Annus
for the next video, i'd like you to lay down under the slapper and receive 10,000 spanks to celebrate 2021
1:56 what in the world.
this is what we do.
It's told Huns made food like this while riding horse the put it between their legs
Sadly, the chicken was not cooked. That is why he didn't eat it. Go see brew's video if u don't believe me
I mean you were close
Why am I learning more watching a video of slapping chicken than I did in my 12 years of school
It is still raw as fuck, dud wtf
now thats what i call slap cook
Imagine the cave man ancestors seeing this they probably would be ashamed
Chicken spanker.
Wife: Can we have Steak tonight? Him: Sure, let me beat it 34'000 times... Wife: K
SLAPP BASS NEXT TIME PLS
Not sure how I feel about you using the music from Mark Rober’s montages, but otherwise congrats on your meat beating accomplishment!
Chicken is heaven: How dare them first the kill me then they cook me in such a dum way🤬
Is that a rice cooker I see
This feels like a scuffed Mark Rover video. Music and all
Look at him grow
Which song you used around Minute 5👌
And now try it with a chicken that is alive :)
I’m pretty sure hacksmith slap cooked a chicken with his rocket slap
Genius
Lol until explosion
Lololololol
Lol
Chicken or steak ?
As my old man used to say... Don't beat your meat too fast or your arm might break. You've only got two.
FINALLY!!!! LETS GOOOOO! I’m so happy and proud!!
I had the realization that he basically spanked a chicken to well-done.
Next reunion: Chicken is raw and the oven is broken Louis: Let me slap it
Energy is energy. What matters is how well you can transfer it from one place to another - and this doesn't seem to be really effective.  /s
Beating the meat till its cooked😂🤣   Someone just had to say it.
Boy you did it. You fucking did it. 🤟

You Literally Beat the shit out of a chicken
For those who might not see how crazy hard this is to pull off, as a mechanical engineer I can attest to what NIGHTMARE fatigue is. If you accumulate cycles that quickly with such high excentric forces at play, it requires insane levels of engineering to balance the stress and strain amplitudes, such that it can survive for a long time. By just "intuitively" building rigs like that, the only way to make it work is basically just to massively overengineer all the critical parts and even that is sometimes hard to achieve - as this series proved.
This is how to slap sex a chicken by smacking it constantly to cook it to death.   “YOU WILL GET SLAPPED BECAUSE I WANT TO COOK YOU”.

9:21 witam Polaków
meat beater isn't the best name at all lol
I... I am so confused.
Next video: I cooked my meat by beating it
Davie504 should be proud of you
Anybody notice he used mark rober  music
The chicken's great... but those shoes 🔥
Or u can also ask Davie504 to SLAPP the chicken
Your video inspired me to be an engineer. Thank you!!
anh em Việt Nam đâu rồi?
budget mark rober LUL
He did it.
How has the YT algorithm got me here

The next question is how many Randy Johnson fastballs does it take to cook a chicken
Microwave was invented in 1946  people on 1945:
The swearing mark rober
it's like ur asking for a better gun that features: 1. faster rpm 2. less recoil 3. big magz
Well just buy a stamping machine it kind of work the same way without breaking that often.
The absolute madman...
davie504 will love this. SLAPP chicken
And he took that personally...
The Mark Rober of  the chicken world
Quality content. I'm so proud of him for powering through no matter how many times the rig broke. 💪🏾💪🏾
@Davie504
I watched mark and Ethan try but thought it wasn’t true. This is pretty cool
I’ve seen bits and pieces of this journey online but I’m glad I found the final installation as an actual full length video.
And now we don't need fire to cook 😂😂
If I would be a hater I would say that he switched the stakes when he said I will go a poor out the juice
And uhhh...yeah...this is a thing now...cool cool..
Didn’t eat it tho 😬😬😬
My man said he doesn't cook much, but on behalf of the Asian community, we're very proud of the fact that he has a rice cooker.
So you proceed to dump the juice off camera? I dont know rick, looks like you swap that meat right there
Dude, those bulgogi meals from Hello fresh are good! For reals.

Why the heck was this in my recommended in the first place? I mean, I watched it and I learned something new but still.....why?
Top ten legendary sequels
The meat beater ?!?!?!
AMAZING
I saw that small ant pencil sharpening video suggested.
wow the future of cooking
I need this guy to be my science teacher no cap
Put a new whole meaning of Beating Meat
I'm in that weird part of YouTube again and I dont regret it at all.
You sound like the chicken owed you some serious 💸
THE MEAT BEATER 5000
YEARS OF HUMAN EVOLUTION HAS LED TO THIS MOMENT
Fine. FINE, YOUTUBE. I'LL WATCH HOW TO COOK A CHICKEN BY SLAPS.
Unus Annus really did so much to the internet as a whole. So glad.
i hope you buy the same about of food you use for science and donate it to people who need it because as much as this is fun to watch it’s sad to think those chickens died just for a funny bit of science
"The original meat beater"
Put it in a vacuum
How did I even get here?
Honestly, if you were to open a restaurant in LA that only cooked things by slapping it you would be successful.
Now I'm confused. I always heard guys talking about spanking a monkey, and CHOKING a chicken....
9:21 widziałem to bracie udało Ci się.
Sees the title of the video  Me: Unus Annus...Unus Annus...
This has to be the dumbest/ Funniest thing I ever seen!
1:04

Ech, Polacy XD 11:54
wow this takes a whole new meaning of beating your meat
Shoulda just hit up Mark
No one's gonna Notice the Mark Rober music?
I feel like bagged hamburger meat probably would've been better.
Now you got to build a machine thar cooks eggs with slaps.
2:40 bruh I'm seeing the chat saying "Beat The Meat"
I love slapsteak comedy
I putted F for respect, I lost Moni, thx
Ask davie 504
We need Davie504 in here
You can eat beef raw just saying
gross
“Time to slap some meat” you mean beat some meat lol nerds
Clickbate is annoying
knock off mark robber
Sombody tag Gordon Ramsey

Call bullshit all day
Calling it a "meat beater" with a straight face is what convinced me to actually pay attention. Thanks.
'Chicken Sized' 'Plate Armour' needed. Nice Louis.
I tell you, in 30 years this has been the best video of my life....thanks
That recipe slaps. 👌🏻👌🏻
you were litteraly beating meat lol
Been emotionally invested in this since the original post started going around. I can sleep easy now, thank you!
Think about a restaurant that cooks chicken like that. I guess it would be called meat slappers.
This is the only Chicken Davie504 will ever eat again ;)
i don’t like how it still has blood in it

10:26 Track is By Thought Beings called "Aquastor"
Did you really have to call it the 'Meatbeater9001'?   Short Answer: No you didn't, but I'm glad you did anyways...
The video title cracked me up. 🤣
He protecc He attack But more importantly He makes chicken slap
This guy is so amped to slap a chicken into a cooked existence
When it comes to beating meat, I truly can't compete
I swear this video has popped up on my recommendations for a straight week and everytime it's had a different thumbnail.
Meat beaters rise up
YOO I MADE SOMETHING LIKE THIS A MONTH AGO! love your video!
Challenge Gordan Ramsay to beat your meat.
This guy is like mark rober with less subscribers
he clearly left the room to dump 'liquid' and got a different staek

This guy is a legend.
Someone should slap you for not cooking the chicken.
What a mad man
Now how hard to cook it in one slap?
OC deslikes are from vegans
This guy is copying mark robers of his voice and his theme tune
The untidy crow macroscopically exercise because sister generally wait after a legal pocket. enchanting, difficult flavor
I better get this for my meat
This took *beating your meat* to a whole new level
6:04 everyone: F  that one guy: hi
i wonder if it would have hold on to cook it completely from scratch. you heated it to 40 degrees sous vide but getting it to 40 degrees would have taken alot from your machine already. so not sure if it would have worked if you started from scratch
9:54 IT got cooked since steak has more of blocky Look and IT slapped entire up
i'm thinking about my GF bro

he jus did it? i did the same thing a few months ago and did it on stream but didnt have this much people supporting me...
Why?
Đúng là youtuber xàm ở đâu cũng có không phải chỉ ở Việt Nam
my parents:**cook chicken with an oven** me: let’s just slap the chicken
This man took beating your meat to an whole other level
Celsius is not the scientific unit to measure heat, but it is the most used unit in the whole world. The scientific one is Kelvin, why it is scientific? Because it doesn't have a negative part. Why is that good? Because temperature is how much internal energy an object has and... we can't have negative internal energy:/  This was for everybody in the comments who said °C is scientific.

Ok...but why?
Imagine if the chicken  looked back at itself in the after life 😂
Don't let RussianBadger see this video
I thought scientists measured in kelvins?
ayo 6:39
Since you could cook a chicken by slapping it (lol) you should be able to cook a chicken using vibrations from an actuator? Using this kinda setup, is it theoretically possible to cook a chicken using music? PLEASE PROVE THIS
meat beater
This man just trying to sell You a slap vide cooker system
Did he stall the steak?
Anyone else hear from daily dose of Internet? :)
PETER!!
Davie504 accepts your challenge
.
You went through the effort of slapping a steak to 60C and didn't even season it
“The original meat beater”    Dang bro

Now the real question is, and im not sure if this makes sense. Can you cook a chicken with bodyheat let alone heating up the room
I bet davie504 couldn’t even do this.
Use the slapper as a potato masher
A true human achievement
David504: Slap the B A S S Louis Weisz: Slap the C h i c k e n
You made a machine that tenderizes steak while you cook it amazing job
Finally he use celcius f you  america

“It’s time to slap some freaking meat” uhhh did this man sounded like beat meat💀
up this comment so Davie504 see this video
Hey guys what do you want for dinner?   "Slapped meat."  What?  "Slapped meat."
Next up, slap spaghetti to keep it warm
What is he gonna do with the machine? I can think of one really good use for it.
this somehow reminds me of mark robber
I feel really bad for thinking this but all I can vibe from this video are major Mark Rober rip off vibes
This guy livestreams himself beating his meat? ._.
I'm not eating chicken again
10:44 "bad steak"? I guess you could call it a _misteak..._  I'm sorry
So no flying cars?
Jesus loves you
Thats not medium rare, its still bleeeddiinnggg

Blessed be the YouTube algorithm
Love how it’s called “meat beater” lol
Davie should watching this
Unas Annus vibes
Someone show the Russian badger and heavenly
Why not add a spring to absorb the energy of the slap and convert it to heat, this along with a insulated housing would solve the kinetic impact issue and should roast the chicken but I guess technically you wouldn't be slapping the chicken.
Unus and Annus would be so proud

Davie504: my boy grows up so fast ❤️
I had no idea this guy existed but I love this. What an awesome achievement. Though... I do posit that the chicken wins until it tastes stomach acid. Or at least passes some sort of laboratory test for pathogens.
This is peak YouTube
Go get some decent silverware
2:18 no in science they use Kelvin to measure the temperature
9:21 look at chat
bet Minecraft chicken are watching this
Thanks YT recommendations

All this dedication and hardwork, just for a good-hard scrumptious slaaaam on thaaat meeattt! I love thaat!

Did you asked Davie504 for permission to slap?
On the bright side, we can find another use for this machine....
Discount Marc Rober
....Alright. It`s 02:41 am. I`m don`t know english well, and I understand almost nothing. but i`m still here, why? i don`t know.
imagine Davie504 reacting to this
Both you and Mark Rober speak in the same Cadence
We all are capable of beating meat. I don’t need a machine
He protecc He attac But most importantly he slaps the chickens back
So if got slapped by that thing imma get cooked. Nice
Meat beater. Lol
how is this not on trending
He took beating meat to another level
Im going to send it to my physics teacher
I feel like this video is heavily inspired by Mark Rober, the cuts, the pacing, the music, the way you emphasise words and structure sentences is identical

If the crackheads from New York had a cooking show
This is important.
All this when you could have just asked #Davie504
what about using a flexible arm on the slapping end.  you could have multible slats to add to it to make it stiffer would also absorb shock and the motor end would break less
𝗗𝗮𝘃𝗶𝗲𝟱𝟬𝟰 𝗔𝗣𝗣𝗥𝗢𝗩𝗘𝗦
This is something you watch a 2am on a school night.
Davie504 approves
Um so nobody is gonna mention that he cut the steak with a plastic knife and fork
bruh Celsius isn't for real science, that's what kelvin is for. celsius is for britbongs. Fahrenheit is the chad temperature measurement, as it is easy to use for both cooking AND measuring body heat, meanwhile celsius is for people who can't do complex math.
Mark Rober would be proud.

Its 2 am. How did I get here.
Or you could just... cook it
I remember when [REDACTED] tried this
so this is what bruce banner is doing after endgame
How he cooked it is because of how fast it slaps that it warms it
9:42 did nobody take in consideration why he left off camera view? 🤔 I’m no conspiracy theorist but I do not like when content creators do this
This gives a whole new meaning to beating meat
so funny
This guy just got hired by fleshlight
The meat beater 😂
100% mark rover inspired. The format, the cutting, even the music.
Louis: “Celsius is the temperature of science.” Kelvin: “Am I a joke to you?”
Fantabulous!!! I love the way it has minimal heat on the chicken.
He beat his meat into submission and then ate it
Damn....thats nice
So with how you explained that if you cook chicken at a lower temperature for longer, it’ll still kill the bacteria and stuff, that means medium rare chicken is possible?
I really pity them for using their excellent engineering skills and smarts to do that but good job anyway
Hello history books
Today I’ve learned the people from school assignments actually exist
Who knows in a few years the "MB" could actually be very useful, because instead of using gas/fossil fuels, we use electricity or batteries to run it, nice.
Couldn't you just take the average slap and then time it by the power in a slap? Than you could have one slap that immediately cooks it
I need your machine, for uh... science.
what the fuck am I doing with my life?
In Philippines we use that too
my laptop reached 90 c meaning i can literally cook eggs lol
Me got rare steak... Aight just need 34000 slaps on that thing and ima feast that thing with some Pepsi

All this science shit and you white people still forgot to season the damn chicken smh
Fake
Why didn’t you lube the pivot point with a food grade grease?
I would have maybe believed the steak was cooked by slapping, if you wouldn't have walked out of the room with it before showing the steak. Also you can see the camera cut and go to a new scene as you walk back out the door with what I am assuming is a cooked steak that you switched out with the one that was slapped. The chicken looked nowhere near cooked. Too much of a difference between the chicken and the steak. I don't buy it.
A random video in my recommended... I enjoyed this.
Finallyyyyyyyyy
Is this guy… related to Mark Rober?
Through many dangers, toils and snares, you've done it.
Ironically, I choked a chicken by spanking it just as well.
should have changed the meat beater versions every time its upgraded, nevertheless good content ;)
same music, video choreography, animation plugs, voice tone and pitch and talk pattern..etc....not trying to hate but this is clearly a Mark Rober imitation. still enjoy the content just try to be more original.
this is too fucked up for me
DAVIE504 APPROVES
10:24 "My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined"
Davie504 would approve this epic slapping
Unus Annus.
just say you slapped a steak instead no need to clickbait
No papu, está re crudo eso, tiralo a la parrilla capo
This was weird... yet satisfying.
"The original meat beater had it's problems" Hey man you leave my personal baggage out of this
Kyle Hill said this was impossible
Bruh Friend: I dare u to cook a chicken with slapping it  Louis Weisz: say no more
1:55 was I the only one to find this extremly wierd
I'm sorry I think I'm missing some context here was this a lost bet or something
Memento Mori
He finally did it
*proud yet sad unus annus sounds*
You Beat the Meat!!
Mark rober looks different
Slapping a chicken is a slow way to build heat. Choking a chicken creates heat much more quickly and retains heat longer.
He is a man of commitment, focus, and sheer fucking will
Weisz? I thought better of you but you thought nothing of milking your name for some shekels. What a shame.
Davie504 can cook a chicken by slapping it.
This is a lot of energy for just cooking a chicken..
mentally stable Micheal reeves
Beating your meat in public.... You should be arrested!
Omg Celsius is so annoying I gotta sit an figure that shit out
69420..  Nice.. very nice
I think Gordon Ramsey should have a look at this.
I wish I could get back the 60 seconds I spent watching this...
He is like the younger version of mark rover
Wtf... is this the way of the future??? I guess that game markplier played about the slapping the spaghetti to keep it warm wasn't complete bullsh*t!
Meatbeater 9001? You might want to rethink the name 🤣😂🤣😂
Quarantine really messed you up, didnit?
Intense Mark Rober vibes
Or you could just cook the chicken like a normal person and not waste materials and a perfectly normal piece of chicken on this
Yo what the fuck
7:05 dababy
Fuck hello fresh
I remember watching the lives in the early hours of the morning repeatedly saying either ; MEAT BEAT, BEAT MEAT, BEAT IT JUST BEAT IT, MEAT BEATER etc 💀
Oh i remember this.
one order of slapped chicken please
Mark Rober #2
need to season the chicken ;)
Slap a chicken once and it's considered animal cruelty Slap a chicken a million times and it's considered cooking
Unus annus
Question: So what do you do at work?       Answer: I engineer meat pounders.
SUB TO THIS MAN!! he took beating the meat to a whole new level!
I clicked on this video because,
The dedication that these Engineer-youtubers have is incredible... days, sometimes weeks spent on a project, that ultimately gets like no use once the actual video is done
Next time please use Fahrenheit, the actual temperature gauge
Why am I watching this.
Well actually the scale for real science is Kelvin for the Temperatur but still better then Fahrenheit...
At 9:40 he literally changed the steak so i consider this fake
Why do I feel like this could possibly be a new field of science??? 🤔  And why do I also feel like this is what Wilbur Robinson would be like if he were real? 🤔
why you dind't cooked in the oven ?
I wonder if he’s gonna make a battle bot about this
A new meaning of Robot Chicken lol
Families in 2030 be like:  — Darling, can you slap some chicken for a dinner? — Sure, honey
has science gone too far?
I could of cooked that with my hands beating meat
This a Madlad
random 1: uhh hey the chicken aint fully cooked yet but the oven aint usable rn what should i do random 2: slap it random 1: wha-
Why I am single..
1:20 I started hearing the same music that I heard in Mark Rober. Is that popular around people who make stuff. I wouldn't know...
'Efficient' is my second name
@Louis Weisz Hi from an LTT fan !
while im glad it was cooked i feel like its be not that much longer if it was pushed just a bit more just to be sure to make it so it cant get contaminated while cooking
9:19 when you've been doing nnn and the time passes midnight to December 1st...
i’ve never been so happy to see someone beat their meat
i would like you to make things like, The Nokia Hammer, or The Pepcalibur. Ynow other funny stuff
I've just watched a man eating a slapping-heated meat with plastic knife and fork, I really don't complain about it
this is mark rober music):
this video is a meme lmao
Ahah Niiice! This is awesome! You should do a slap chop 😂
Stuck in the house make a machine and slap raw meat till it's cooked
2021 for you right here
1 saitama slap
*chants softly in Unus Annus *
Have I heard this music somewhere else before?
her: show me what those hands can do 😏 me: *slaps chicken*
Louis Weisz and Mark Rober should join forces.
why?
disappointed that I didnt find Davie504 in the comments XD
Shoulda just gotten Davie504 in there. He'd of taken care of that in one fell slap
what i find fascinating is that the energy it took (7.5kWh) would move an electric car (assuming 170Wh/km) almost 50 kilometers. That‘s just to put into context how much power this takes :D
Mom: what are you having for dinner?  Louis: slapped meat.
Im proud of you for switching to Celsius. :)
Hullo, Gordon Ramsay? You have to see this...
I wonder if the efficiency of the slapper could be improved!  I bet there is a whole bunch of loss involved in just turning the arm around, without any energy transferred to the actual chicken.  Maybe adding a spring to form a resonator with the arm would improve slap turn-around.  Also, DEFINITELY adding a huge flywheel could improve things - the motor's output power would be more consistent, and the slap itself could happen with a fair bit more "whap"  I also think that a lot of the mechanical failures could be eliminated by transferring most of the kinetic slap energy into the arm first, and letting its inertia do the slap, rather than having the motor firmly coupled and thusly causing a really sharp spike in force across the driving bolt. Again some form of resonant slap-circuit, where the motor stimulates a slapping arm that resonates at the wanted Slap-Speed, might work really well.
He can create a business now selling steak for old people using the slapper
This guy literally went through an entire process to build a robotic slapping arm to cook a steak but cuts it with plastic cutlery
Kelvin
Davie504 approves
The new mark rober ???
why am i getting mark rober vibes from this vid XD
Thats how Davie504 cooks.
"I cooked a chicken by slapping it" 8.6 million people: Hmmmm... interesting...
How much slaps to cook a human finger
Well you used bolts directly as axles for something like that, it figures they would fail like that.
Most people watch men using machines to beat their meat for a different reason.  I'm glad I'm the special kind.
My man did it! He's a mad genius!
I got here from looking up slow cooker recipes, thanks YouTube
Alternative title:  Man films him building a machine to slap and beat his meat effectively, then eats it.
Its alive
Dude, how do you still have under 500k subs
This dude is the real life Gary the Gadget Guy from Club Penguin
I have already thought of so many meat beating jokes I probably should say in these comments
Me at 3 am:  A yes slapping chicken
he even used the mark rober music lmao
Whyyy?
Could you maybe turn down the soundtrack when you're talking dude?
Beating your meat takes on a new meaning...
"Hey honey, what are you watching?" "A dude beating his meat until it's cooked" "Oh... i want  a divorce"
My hand is a meat beater
you should have used rgb pc fans, increases cooling capacity by 600%
Remember to patent the design
@David504 should watch this
who else is here after ddoi
So by defining cooked low enough, you were able to claim success? OK.
Wow... Gordon Ramsay should watch this long version instead of the short TikTok clip.
That crazy son of a bitch, he did it!
Real Science might be done in Celsius but cool people use Kelvins.
i like ya cut g
2:45 6:36 7:06 LESSSSGOOOOO
Davie504 is proud of you
This was unintentionally the funniest video I have ever watched
This isn't really cooking by slapping, you're using areogel could've put a candle in there for a half hour and it'd cook it.
I love this kind of scientific videos.
This here is proof that we can do anything we put our mind into...   Also can i please ask what or how you got this idea? 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Why does this feel like a format of a Mark Rober video ? Anyone ?
The most disappointing thing about this is that I don’t see any seasoning
Hows this guy wearing palace 😂😂😂😂😂
No you didint
You didnt you
one of the weirdest youtube recommendations I have ever had but hey, I'll take it.
MEAT BEATER 2000 engage!
Brings a whole new meaning to the phrase “beat your meat”
10:29  well , if you ignore the fact that it tastes really bad , it`s actually pretty good :D
This is how we'll cook chicken in the future
meat beater
Unus Annus?
Now your next step is to do this w/o electricity.
11:32 apparently you can eat fiberglass depending on what aerogel you used, there could be minimal side effects to some side effects like vomiting, general pain, the usual things you might feel when you feel like you have eaten something you should have not  i wouldn't eat that with the gels but maybe if there was no gels i probably would steak looked ok though *slap slap slap* = now ya got a meal
Its 2:57 am here but this seemed more important
Thank u for putting the sponsor in the end of the video... Idk why, but it made me want to watch it more, instead of skipping.
Me in December after part taking in no nut november 9:18:
i really recommend hello fresh since i’ve been subscribed quite long and it especially helps with picking a meal cause im a single father and being creative is very hard but with hello fresh its not
2:17 °Kelvin is typing...
That heat sink tho🤣🤣🤣
they sure did *beat that meat*
funny idea bad execution. should have done a flapwheel instead
Yeah....you bullshitted your way into calling this cooked...
Algorithm kept suggesting this for 1 week str8. Not disappointed.
"meat beater"... Niceeee
Wtf
I feel like Davie504 should have been involved in this project.
In this universe fire was never discovered.
I can say that is not chicken
*creates meat beating machine*
Wana be mark rober 🤣🤣
As A Person Using Hello Fresh For A While, I Can Confirm Three Things: Easy Cooking (Simple Instructions) It’s Very Tasty (Like Amazingly Tasty) My New Favourite Meal Was Created By Hello Fresh!  Thanks For More Free Meals For My Lazy Hands To Make 😋
davie504 approves
BrUh
i would use this machine for something different if y'all know what I mean
you crazy son of a bitch, you did it, you actually did it.
Finally!
pasteurized =/= cooked
1:05 The Meat Beater lol
9:21 i love poland
Great, now boil water by slapping the bowl
The question is how much money did you cost for all of this since you have to buy a lot of stuffs
Can somebody please call Gordon Ramsay
I thought I would be smarter after this video. But I wasn't smart enough to know I was wrong.
My dads belt could cook it in one hit.
I subscribed!  to PewDiePie!
Good to beat your chicken.
You shouldn't have made a cut after 9:32. How can we know the bag you open after that is the same you've been slapping?
Jesus
Master meatbeater
Now i wanna see a "How many slaps to make my 'Meat' cooked"
Men this is a f*":;"+#+#:# of time
@davie504 #davie504
Is no one going to talk about the name ? Meat Beater, really ? :P :P
No the chicken is already mushy
"I wanted more than anything to eat a meal cooked by the power of slaps" is such a powerful line

i knoowww , it doesn't look that good right now .. but watch this!
The slim quit weekly stir because donkey minimally grin round a redundant psychiatrist. panicky, deranged daffodil
Kinda cheated this time with the bag over the chicken
I have heard about the science of beating your meat but this one is an impressive display of this science!
so you beat tf out of a chicken to cook it
A wise man once said... “If kinetic energy can turned into heat energy, how fast do I have to punch a chicken to cook it?”
You actually did it.
The Meat Beater. 😏
I guess you could say... you where beating your meat.
When he said meat beater my mind went on to think of something else
Why don't you just vibrate it?
Có ai qua đây từ cái bài post trên facebook không :))
This... is the future and I love it!
This guy needs to collab with Gordon Ramsay and cook one of his dishes with the meatbeater :P
FINALLY!!! CONGRATS BRO
Someone would buy this for all the wrong reasons
"Meat Beater", that sounds SO wrong.
11:55 JD

The factor of exploitation of this video is exponential
*Oven companies show up to his doorstep with a small militia*
Oh, good to use also ℃ !  Why not rub but slap ...  ℃も使ってんのええね！　なして擦らずに叩く・・・。
°Celsius is what you use for kid science, Kelvin is what you use for *real* science
Dave504 approves this
bet the russian badger thought he was hot shit laughing at cooking a chicken by slapping it!
Is it just me or does he speak like Mark Rober?
so when can i order a meatbeater?
11:55 jd
Now just add some spices in the bag and  serve it to your friends as your special meal.
inefficient but hey
Now use frictional heat for grilling something.
Me: "How to cook a chicken without oil"  YouTube:
Now, if physical energy is converted to thermal, how hard would I need to punch a chicken to cook it? And could you make a machine to do that
the meat slapper would be perfect for Schnitzel
8:45
he actually did it holy shit
I love this name
how do you beat the life out of something dead??
sous vide is outdated, now gifler is new best way to cook.
Meatbeater 9001😂😂
What a waste of time
Some tasteless bastard will probably make some kind of "Can you cook a chicken by choking it?" joke.
dude. wtf xD
You should strap a fleshlight to that thing
the good ending
In all my years of YouTube viewing, I never, ever, would have thought I'd encounter this. I feel slightly smarter, but more importantly, hungrier.
Salmonella is a killer. Almost killed me once.
I want some
This is what Youtube was created for 👌
People in 1921: by 2021 we'll have flying cars  2021:
why not try a fish
I'll take my  milk steak slapped cooked over hard, with a side of your finest jelly beans sir!
Congrats! U did it xD
For my perspective chicken body can conserve and produce heat easily because you know thats a natural incubation. Soo of course they can stand mid temperature like cold
It's always the MB9001?  You didn't increment the model number with each new incarnation?  I thought this was supposed to be *serious* science.   :D

I'm a vegetarian and clicked this video
*accidentally cooks hand while clapping*
Gordon Ramsay Approves
Has @Davie504 seen this yet??
i can imagine this guy saying "im gonna beat my meat" to his friends and they had no idea what it actually meant.
Madman
Taking meat beating to a whole other level 2.0
Ok so my left hand is still just a lefty, but my right hand is most definitely now named "MB9000" Thanks YouTube.
This guy talk to much
Sus....sus....sus  1:56
Another idea: how much time do you need to scratch a chicken to cook it.
Show this to MrBeast's brother...
Mars yards
i saw technoblade
That's more smasher than slapper
Mark Rober?
I’ve slapped my chicken faster this is nothing
So since physical energy can be turned into thermal energy, I just need to punch a chicken fast enough to cook it.
Meat beater 🤙🏻
Imagine sleeping one that’s alive
_So we spent more money_
...how did I get here?
Him eating steak me looking at the thumbnail saying what the fuck that isn't chicken
We could have had flying cars by 2021 ....  But instead look what we got ... a f@Ck!ng meat beater.
Davie504 : EPICO!!!
Is it just me or would this actually be a delicious steak due to the tenderizing effect and lower temps required?
12:40 gente, um estadunidense fazendo arroz E DANDO CERTO!!!!!!!!! Novidades aqui
This Video : exists  8.5 million people : finally some good fu*king Science
I just watched another man slap his meat for 13 minutes
now if we can slap liberals back to reality then 🇺🇸 will be great again 👍🏼
Imagine being the chicken that died for this
Davie504 would be proud
Some might say there is a new meaning to beating meat
*Gordon Ramsay has entered the chat* *Gordon Ramsay has left the chat but told me to tell you to fuck right on off.*
Youtube recommended in 5 years: Cooking a chicken by staring at it.
How did I get from "Far Over The Misty Mountains Cold" Lord of the Rings song to slapping a chicken . . . ? -_-
"I cooked chicken by slapping it"  8.5M people: hMmMmm inTErsTiNg
who else is here from daily dose of internet
9:48 wouldnt It be fucked up if when he went through that door, he just grabbed a cooked steak in a similar bag?
Me home alone: “Pft pathetic”
Mmm
Omg WHY???? just cook it. Whats wrong with this Generation? They are so Stupid
thats not a chicken
Someone needs to get Russianbadgers attention on this
Now that’s beating meat efficiently
i subbed when he said adjustable slap depth
Mark Rober Imposter
That man is living his Life!!
Davie504 approves.
Poor chicken ;-;
This actually put me in an existential crisis  Like actually
“How hard do I have to punch a chicken to cook it?”
Did you season it first?  At the very least, salt and pepper?
Ye
4:33 Song?
the “original meat beater” sent me
Whoever disliked this has no taste
Davie504 needs to see this
meat beater 5000 --mine works different
mark robers brother lolll
you need a welder.
Did I watch a guy cook a chicken by slapping it? Yes.  Is it 11:00 at night with school tomorrow? Yes.  Do I regret it? ...no comment.
I bet bass players a jealous
Should have marinated the chicken before slapping it lol
Meat beater 9,001 😭😭😭
Yea! Go meat beaters!
Cool project but this guy is sooo annoying. Stop fucking screaming
I challenge Davie504 to cook a chicken with the power of SLAP.
Now , slapping some wheat or leaves to make a fire. xD
Can you try cooking food with lighting somehow?
Who do you think you are stealing mark robers signature song
I mean... did you season it?
Funny how a Davie404 brought me here. Very interesting, thank you.
No.... way......
Next project: How many kicks does it take to bake a deep fried pizza 🍕😂
Where’s the lotion
A mechanical meat beater lmfao 🤣
This man might be Mark Rober 2.0
Momento Mori
I had an apprentice ask me this exact question two months ago and now I have the answer
i te jebać disa na czacie XDDD
Machine that beats your meat? I'm in...
1:04 “the original meat beater” I never thought I’d hear something like that ever said
This reminds me of mark rober
How can he slap?!?
Ramsey we need you
Why is this on my recommend
That chat message saying "I feel like I'm witnessing domestic abuse" summed up the whole video
So you generated heat and then contained that heat. So you created a ridiculous oven and the chicken cooked inside the oven.
I think it’s funny how many people can dislike something so ridiculous and likable
What you were all waiting for: 1:56

Lol
This vid made my day 🤣🤣🤣👍👍
Things aren't just cooked to kill bacteria,it also helps to more efficiently absorb nutrients
This man really made "beating his meat" possible
Obligatory meat beating observation
I'm curious to see Gordon Ramsay's reaction to this.
im so disgusted lmao
Make sure the door is locked... you don't want your mom barging in while you're beating your meat
meat beater? O.o
Gordon ramsay: *no.*
just cook it with the engine

“This is the meat beater 9001”  Me: I need that.
They just put a cook chicken for the thumbnail but in the video it looked nothing like that
Someone show this to davie504
He beat the shit out of a chicken and cooked it
But my question is how hard do I have to hot a chicken once to cook it?
I was today years old when I realised how much stupid, yet interesting shit people really do
You need to try a tougher cut of beef. like shank or chuck steak.

How is the chicken cooking? Is this an example of mechanical energy being converted into heat energy?
How many cooks does it take to slap a chicken??
put the steak up like a speed bag and cook your dinner while working out
This is everything I've ever wanted
You took the bag in the other room to switch the steak dude

I might be wrong but I believe degrees Kelvin is used for real science.... at least science done at aperture Laboratories
Why did I watch this
No s and p or garlic anything Montreal steak seasoning ? This guy is too white for my taste
Is this where the phrase beating the meat comes from.
I thought I’d seen it all...
Your engineering is really bad
yeah girls this guy can cook ! he'll be a great bf
Next challenge: I slapped a chicken by cooking it

Imagine this at a restaurant: Customer: This steak has a peculiar, but delicious taste.  Chef Weisz, may I know how you made it?      Louis: I slapped the bitch out of it.
"It tastes like you've been chewing it for a minute already." ⇦ ROTFLMAO!
9:21 jd?
Another drop in food cooking standarts. 75 celsius is not enought for cooking meat or chikien. However slapping is hot. Beating aerozol can with a sledge when i was a kid and then burning myself with that flattened metal was one of the most scientific impressions i ever had.
The knock off mark robor ( idk how to spell)
You mad lad, you actually did it.
wow. this whole thing was a hello fresh commercial. best marketing team ever
Now let's see if it can be modified to cook a chicken in a defensive, or if need be offensive manner.
Power of slaps🤟🏾🤟🏾🤟🏾🤟🏾🤟🏾
When slapping a dead chicken carcass to pulp is considered peak entertainment, you know we're all doomed
How many slaps to cook an egg?
“Hey you busy?” “Yeah I’m beating meat”  “I did not need to know that” “Wait I didn’t mean it like that, I’m literally beating..... hello??”
That's so cool,
This video is so good i forgot i'm vegan
l knew seen YouTube
Nawet tu ( even here ) 9:21 chat " jebać Disa " xD
This is my kinda science
Now you have to work on holding a fork properly.
Slap
Roses are red, Violets are blue I didn’t search for this Neither did you
So, anything over that is overcooked
This was very important science! Thanks for your hard work! This was a fun video!
Needed more air horns for 69420
I saw something and so did you 1:56
Great experiment!! But it's so annoyed how this production it's so similar to Mark Roberts videos that it's even using the same backing songs that this stops feeling original at all. Hope you can be creative in production as you are on the making the experiments.
Chicken to slapping machine  Chicken: slap me, daddy! Machine: wtf😲
His friend comes over Hey can I heat up my noodles in your  Microwave um  OK pulls out the slapper his friend what are you doing put his noodles on the machine what are you doing to my  Noodlessssssssssssss
I'm so happy bro.
How Davie504 prepares his meals
This is the way Davie504 cook meat.
Did mrbro already do this?
If you need help in future, i know thing or two about beating the meat.
Huge Mark Rober vibes...
Who comes here from daily dose of internet?
1 year later... Come on down to Slap Happy Meats! Where all the meat is tenderized and cooked at the same time via our revolutionized Slap cooker. Try our limited time deal, the Slapper Jack burger with layers of Pepperjack cheese on multiple Slap Patties, slapped to your liking :P
Science.
Is it possible to increase the temperature to 69.42 degrees just by slapping ?
I was here like 3 months ago and you had 20k subs and now you have 400k holy
6-8 hours of slapping to cook a chicken... I mean alright I guess lol
Maybe had some of the fat liquefying around 50?
I've been trying for year to cook my chicken by choking it.
Giod job Slappers
My beats will leave you COOKED cuz they slap about this hard
Using 1 kg of U235 to make a cup of tea. Efficiency!
Pfft, pathetic. I cook my chicken with my hands while it's still clucking.
this brings a whole new meaning to beating your meat ...
so if your power goes down and you wanna have a steak, you slap it until its cooked
Now do it with a living animal that's trying to run
Immagine living beneath him in an appartment xD
Top sirloin?
If this meat slapper was powered by a v8

For science!
The only chicken ever cooked by slaps?? You've never been round Gordon Ramsay's house for tea.

2:22 Shouldn't it be in Kelvin, then? 😉
Vegans gotta be crying right now
Enough talking already I want to see a chicken getting slapped by a machine
spends hours and hours making a meat slapping machine that cooks a steak, EATS IN PLASTIC FORK
Davie504 can cook chicken with one holy slap.
my right hand is stronger than meatbeater9001
Okay guys, here me out. What if we built a bicycle powered slap cooker.   For survival situations. No electricity required.
This Shit slaps
So you didn't achieve cooking it. The goal was to cook it and you didn't.
And welcome the meat beater 9000!
I lived to see the moon landing, home computers, cellphones, electric cars, and the meat beater 9001. What a life its been.
The naughty height analytically squeeze because tabletop perinatally smell abaft a immense ship. married, assorted driving
Davie504’s 1 holy slapp can cook it
Imagine Gordon Ramsay sees this😂😂😂  "YOU FOOKING DONKEEYYYY!!!!"
Title: *cooked chicken*  In video: *cooked steak*
What did the chicken did to deserve this 😅😂
No one:   Mark and Ethan: 0 o 0
0:44 lol the Hydraulic Press Channel! I'm surprised they didn't suggest to just squash the chicken with an hydraulic press.
I WONDER IF ALL DA PPL GO TAKE DIS IDEA AND MAKE STEK BY S L A P
What the fuck did I just watch😂
He talks about how soft the steak was.  You just tenderized it for two hours.
9:20 JD
*Slap like now*
Davie504: Approved
that aint cooked
Memento mori my friends
KGs & °c should be made a world wide enforced law punished by slaps off the chicken slapping machine if not used.. 🤗
Those chicken died to get slapped.
Memento mori
Stopped watching when he went back to Celsius
Nah just drop an anvil from space on it
This video made me hungry
It's 60°C, not 60C or 60F
*Proceeds to Slap a Chicken at almost Mach 5 Speed, theoretically cooking it*
Most people: I've never seen seen a man cook a meal with slaps!  *Me* : I've never seen a man eat a steak with plastic utensils.
ima need that machine.

for some reason i didn’t like the clickbait and shouting at the start so i gave it a downvote. turned off by the copy cat style and speech/music to another channel
I feel like you’ll be able to buy it soon in sex shops...
He beats the shit out of it
World record.
I was always wondering what "beating meat" means...
World record.
mad lad
Gordon Ramsay reacts lmao
I thought this was going to be a Michael Reeves video, but then I realized this dude isn't fucking annoying.
Show this to Gordon Ramsay
i hope the dude gave at least three chickens and a steak to a homeless shelter. Seems weird making a commercial for saving food while producing garbage chickens.
Now melt lead using slaps
I seen no seasoning this entire series
It’s about time 😂
I can now say that I have seen everything.
Nobody:  Absolutely Nobody:  Title
Lol using mark robers music, your a wannabe mark rober 😆 your content is so boring
1:05 MEAT beater ( which is a hand ). This is wrong on so many levels 😂
How come he didn't sear the outside? Noob.
wtf
this sounds like a mark rober video
so... Can I cook my bro by just slapping him?     ž
This has nothing to do with it but MY TOE NAIL JUST FUCKING BROKE IN HALF
The Meat beater IS OVER 9000
You also cook meat in order to break the cell membranes and cell walls. Then it is easier for humans to digest, and give more leftover energy.
Now see if you can cook a chicken by choking it... 🐔🤪
He is Mark Rober 2.0 even uses exact same music
oh no FLASHBACKS ah and also  memento mori
What a world we live in; brilliant minds are charting the science of slapping. Slapping chicken... Until it's cooked.     Damn, Grandpa, I hope you're seeing this.
This was insane....subscribed🥴
1:56 👀👀
Great poultry pounder bro
Gordon Ramsay might be interested
69420 😳😎🤣 pog 😱
Who came here after seeing daily dose of internet 😀😀
Why this man think he's mark rover litterly  the same edits and music
3:31 POTG
YES WE'VE DONE IT FINALLY

Up next:how to cook a burger with slaps!
Yeahh
Winner winner chicken not dinner
Yeah louis
Awesome
Woooo
He’s more commited on cooking the chicken with slaps than me with my life.
Damn Subscribe to PewDiePie!
i appreciate the effort and the endurance you guys put up but in the end, you didnt "actually" cook a chicken, since you couldnt eat it so, whats the point of "cooking a chicken by slapping it" when you cant eat it? which is the essential outcome that matters?  it was entertaining, totally, but this has failed, people are only liking this because of the entertainment, not the actual outcome  and lets be real here everyone, the "cooked chicken" he displayed, didnt look cooked or edible at all
The Chicken: Why are we still here,  just to suffer?
Unus annus did NOT do this right...
I don't know what was going but I enjoyed the video
Your like mark rober
Yes
There are 11k idiots in the world.
I don't know what's more impressive. The amount of effort spent to beat the bird, or the amount of puns incurred in development.
walmart mark rober
but did you cook this bloody chicken in the end?
Boys during quarantine be like:
One day, we can look back to all the accomplishments that we achieved due to COVID lockdown boredom.
This man is the next Mark Rober
Sorry maybe because I'm french I don't get it buy why he can't reinforce this arm ?
Chicken
69420 slaps. Davie504 approves!
so turns out its way more efficient than I was expecting. like 2 to 3 times worse than a purpose built oven refined over decades, thats not bad.
Davie504 would have done this with only one holy slap.
Some people don't have this much patience to eat chicken
Why this Dude sound like Sokka
Legend has returned
This is impossible...........but you made it.......
Davie504?
Fire was invented in 0.  People before 0 :
He spanked the chicken till it was cooked.
I do not allow you to use mark rober music
And yet. Still faster than any Slow Cookers. Those damn salesmen..
Im just saying useless humans every where
Davie 504
your neighbors have got to be hating that noise tho. lol. Imagine doing this when living above someone.
Probably the first
I don’t know about you guys think but that chicken slaps for me
why not use something similar to decentralized planetary gears. pretty sure it wont burst into peaces
Try sticking to the American standard of temperature called Fahrenheit
What a proud moment for mankind
This gives a completely new meaning to ' Beat your Meat ' *winky face*
I see you using mark rober's videos' music ;)
as if i needed to be told NOT to cook meats with a slap machine and instead cook it in the oven
Davie504 be like
Use a gear system to increase moter speed/efficiency (big cog to small cog)
No risque comments here, I'm sure.
African Mothers be like: How much is that machine😋
10:03 that meat still breathin tho
You ngl broke my brain
This man just tried to reason not cooking chicken properly
0:03 gordon ramsey
That poor chicken :(
Davie504 would be proud
solution - slap with hand
11:55 jebac disa
This is an example of "People doing weird and amazing things while quarantine"
Haven´t ur parents taught u not to play with ur food? This is what u killed gods creation for? Happy to know u will spent ur next few lifes as a chicken in the meat industry ;)
Humanity finally did it
Can I eat that? -,
I mean you basically tenderised the steak for hours... there was no chance for decent texture
The stormy algebra superfamily ignore because committee congruently stir of a broad area. clumsy, evanescent coal
Wait what
Boi... animals dying for this shit... put your head in there...
I gave a thumb down. I think this is perverted shit. This man designed a machine to automatically slap a cadaver. What’s wrong with u people?
Im gonna make an add   Hello are you tired of cooking your chicken in the most modern way. Well your in luck cause we found a solution for your problem. Today im gonna present to you the SLAP9000 with this kind of technology you can cook a chiken in no time I guarantee that if you use this to your girlfriend he will be calling you dady
next do a live chicken

You just spent hundred of dollars just to cook a chicken. Lol
You just spent hundred of dollars just to cook a chicken. Lol
Don't be shy tell us you make the smaller version of meat beater 😏🤣
You mean you cooked your meat by beating it
you've just watched a documentary on how davie504 prepares chicken for his pizza
The most impressive thing about this man is his ability to cut a stake with plastic utensils.
FINALLLYYY
No CHICKEN were harmed in making this video....
that mark rober music tho...
imagine going to a farm and just punching a chicken really hard and it just falls and its steaming and cooked
Hello fresh sucks
I’ve been doing all wrong. I thought you spanked the monkey, but choked the chicken. I’ll have to try spanking the chicken
My right hand is also a meat beater 9001

Nah you did not
OMG HE USES RICE COOKER!
whats the synthwave song in 8min?
Just slap it so fast it lights on fire
"You can COOK something with the power of slap"  My mother"  *I am four parallel universes ahead of you.*
The arrogant quiver uniformly jump because reason comprehensively remain plus a thinkable canoe. damp, four frail price
Now with a real chicken
Ohhhh so this is how animal abuse is going on during the pandemic
Oop, a chicken ad before this
i guess this rly SLAPS, huh?
Wonder why you didn't use electro-pneumatic forging hammer
If Idiocracy was rebooted it would include this scene at the beginning where they show how dumb science experiments have become. In fact nevermind, we don't need the reboot.
Someone call Mark and Ethan
I hear markrober
Killing the bacteria? With that slapping they prolly dizzy atm
10:24 did anyone else think he was going to say it slaps
It just need one slap from Davie504
Never thought that beating meat could be so complicated
9:20 JEBAC DISA
Original meat beater....😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Harder bolts and shaft will only delay the breaking .. you have nothing to absorb the energy coming from the slaps man
You have took" pressure cooker"to a new level
A linear motor would have been fancy for that. Might even get below energy requirement for a normal oven if enclosed. Then commercialize as a premium method for star restaurants.
*hot slaps*
Ugh don't call it meat beater
Ok, enough internet for today.
When you realize this is a recommended video that is like a week old instead of a 7 year old video that youtube recommends randomly
So your saying I can cook my meat if I beat it really fast
This ain’t nothing new, this is how Bruce Lee cooked his chicken
Why tf he wearin tom sachs mars yards??
Finally !!!
How many times was it slapped?
he looks like charley chaplin without makeup

Excuse me guys, I have to do my 185 daily slaps to my chicken. Well have some good meat in 2 years
Oven was invented in 1789. People in the 1788:
Sequels are always wors... Wait what?
@davie504 check mate
All for the love of chicken
Legend says that this man is Mark Robers best friend
Shame. You could have named it “The meat beater 10 billion”
This mad lad accomplished one of the Unus Annus videos, massive PogChamp
I've heard of a turkey slap
*video comes on recommendation* "I've already watched this last month" *released 6 days ago* "OH MY GOD HE DID IT!!"
As an engineer, i'm crying when I see wooden parts of machine
So you’re saying I can cook my stepsister by slapping her cheeks?
They said it could not be done...
Davie504: hold my beer.. slappers
The og meat beater..
That steak is definitely not cooked
The Meat Beater 9001... Guys I need money
I'm very glad you were able to cook a chicken by slaps
"fire was found 2million years ago"   people 2.1million years ago :
I wonder what will Gordon Ramsay say when he sees this...
2:22 Kelvin is the real standardized temperature scale for science though ;)
this would make the best mochi
I-I dont think its cooked enough because 60 degree celcius isnt enough?
Davie504 would be proud.... slapp like now and be epico
Somehow I think this will pivot nicely into one of those machines in burn after reading
What's next? Spank my monkey?
reminds me of a certain X rated Atari game a certain Nerd spoke of. . .
*Q   U   A   R   A   N   T   I   N   E*
Is this Mark Robers' brother???
All I see here is a big huge waste of food, material and energy. Well done !
yeah but how much force was each slap?
Yoooo wtf...that's crazy
Can it beat other kinds of meats?
My dad...
First we eat their eggs, then their bodies, then we harvest their feathers, then we grind them up and feed them to our pets, now we're slapping them cooked... Poor chickens.
This is so stupid
Hello guys this is your daily dose of internet.
This might the best thing I’ve ever witnessed.
I really appreciate that you have rice cooker
Me when I was in quarantine and I couldn’t get laid
wait, i mistook this video as a Mark Rober one
Not only is it cooked. Its also raw af. Lmao that chick was pink. You know he got salmonella... if he really ate it lol
you absolute mad lad
What we really need here folks is jokes and innuendo about slapping meat or chi... oh wait. Nevermind.
Meat beater 9001
sooooooo uh, where can I buy the meat beater........ asking for a friend 🤨🧐
I need to make one for personal reasons
"cautiously optimistic" Well I didn't know such a term would actually exist
"Beat boy, beat boy, beat that perfect meat boy!"
Right when he said it was 2:50 AM I literally looked at the clock and it’s 2:56 AM
He cut that steak with a plastic knife. after  all that slapping it wasn't  too tough
I got a meatbeater it's my hand. Tryna cook a Winnie by slapping it x10000 time.
russianbadger need to know about this
Louis is just a reincarnation of Colonel Sanders
The hollow step-daughter exclusively tickle because panties concurringly shrug than a actually pumpkin. addicted, clean shade
Unus and Annus would have loved to know your location.
Me: “I wonder how engineers properly stress test materials and various components.” *watches video* “Oh, they probably just give it all to this guy.”
Why didn't you used rubber from tires? I mean 8 rubber slappers mounted on a rotary wheel would probably slap 8x times
Same soundtrack from mark rober
Rofl, imagine use firenheit
also where is @davie504?
can you make a machine that will cook a chicken by choking it?
Off brand mark rober             just kidding
don't let them black moms get it Its gonna be called the child whooper 9000      (ORIGINAL)
How much would i have to pay you to put your hand under that lmao
Unus Annus walked so that this man could run.
Oh I thought it was gonna be one big mega ultra slap 3000
Dear Youtube. What am I doing here?
The resemblance is uncanny
Your twin is Ryland Adams
Meat beater 9000 😂😂😂
Yooo how are the mars yards?
Unus annus Vibes XD
You're on Indian news  P.S that's how I got here
5:45 whats censored in the chat?
Meat beater is a perfect name for this
You know you’re a bonafide nerd when you engineer a machine to slap a chicken and call it the meat beater machine 😐
Literally "beating the meat" lol
You deserve every like and view you get.
As a European I am glad that you now used °C. I don't know what the Fahrenheit temperatures mean. For example: Is 80°F burning hot or is it just slightly above room temperature?
now he jst neep to slap some potatos and gravy
So what are your serious projects like?
"Meat beater" He he.
Tenderizer meets cooker
I need to check back in with my priorities 🙂👜
Send this shit to Russian Badger
“Man I can’t believe I’m eating something that came out the slapper”
I remember the first vid a few month ago, with all the work out in. I'm happy for him
What a loser, didn't even eat the chicken in the end Waste of time.
I sent this to my vegan friend. :)
I know you've spent like over a year on this but ... E.Honda could have done it in like 2 hours max..  Jus sayin..
Any tamilars here😌😍
I just can't imagine what "that vegan teacher" would say in her tiktok after watching this....
This video has tremendous YouTube at 3 AM vibes.
Finally we get another meat beater
He made an machine that could beat his meat respect.
Hello fresh treats it’s employees like garbage
this guy is replacing mark rober
Were sorry, but you have officially reached the end of the internet. There is nothing else left to be seen.
If physical energy can be turned into thermal energy how hard would I have to punch a chicken to cook it
You need to send this to Gordon Ramsay lol
Davie 504 would approve of this slap
me at 3am
Why does he sound so familiar
So I guess this is what the introvert kid do at home
I feel like the people in the comment section totally ignored the fact that you actually cooked a chicken slapping it
0:35 the entire history of minecraft, I guess
9:26 jebac disa XD

I’ve never seen so much meat get beat so hard on camera by a meat beating machine... again
8 million views...6 days.....slapping a chicken  The universe is now in balance....
That's probably the smartest ad that I've ever watched on Youtube.
I’m too high for this...
In the first attempt the chicken was hotter then the temp outside
Beat that meat with the might of Zeus

How can he slap????!?!?!?!
Hey dude
Such a nerd project but nerd is amazing

The saga is finished ......
Make Kyle Hill eat it!

He is really betting him meat
Great idea and great trying but.. You cooked meat but not a chicken
You used plastic utensils
Let's be honest, the algorithm brought us here  No one was looking for this 😂
I EAT SOMETHNG OFF A SLAPPER EVERY NIGHT
i love how i was able to be apart of his growth
Mark and Ethan are typing...
5:45 why is the chat blurred ?

Oh yea beat that meat
People before ovens were envented
Rip Unus Annus
1:55 I hate my mind...
I’m to childish for this video lol.
The only milestone that i appreciated is the 69420th slap
This would be good for goose. Since goose needs to be well tenderized
Where is Davie504?
ASD - Adjustable Slap Depth.
This can be the future of cooking where no gas is needed, I’m imagining 10 years in future a factory of smashed food
how many shakes would it take to cook a chicken though?
I've never slapped a chicken until it was cooked... but I've definitely choked one until it was raw!!
I think this is the first thing I've found of interest without it being from 10 years ago.
9:40 "I'm gonna dump that out . . . " steps suspiciously into the back room and makes the swap with Gordon ramsey "delicsh!"    B-)                 in truth, Bravo !
He did it
Imagine someone walking in while he is assembling it "What are you doing?" "A machine that cooks chicken buy slapping it"     "Uh"
Nasty
I'm really happy I followed this progress since day 1🥰🥰🥰
Now cook a pizza roll, I'll wait
Every body gansta until the slap hand cooks food          This is how ama cook food
fiero revival music nice
steak is not chicken
That's not a chicken
I thought I saw this 3 months ago
Damn, called out HPC like that 😂
this is just as disgustin as it is genius
actually, I'm pretty sure "real science" is measured in Kelvin
Cook a beef Wellington
I'm happy you made this in a mark rover style, it really fits you

Hey guys, this is YOUR daily dose of internet.
1:05 “The meat beater” This is what I was hoping for!
This is amazing
這真太了不起了
He should try to cook the meat in one slap
This is how Davie504 cooks his foods.  👋
“BeCaUsE tHaT’s ThE sCaLe UsEd FoR rEaL sCiEnCe”
This reminds me of Unus Annus :>
People in 1950s we have flying cars in 2021  This guy cooking chicken by slapping it  😑😑
This man is literally scuffed mark rober Imao
Dr.Stone vibes
HE DID IT
9:20 fuck disstream on chat
5:03 well that's a fucking workaround if I've ever heard one.
They said it couldn't be done
Cook fried chicken with slaps
I bet this is how Davie504 cooks his chicken lmao
Meat Beater. Mad TV reference.
Really not sure what value those comments are adding, but OK.
I hope this was inspired by Unus Annus, but I doubt it.
wow that's some real dedication
This man is so annoying bruh please stop with the screaming
The brown edge randomly fire because product worrisomely stain as a handsome rotate. discreet, vagabond gladiolus
This man is taking "beat the meat" to a totally other level    *nothing bad to see here*
How you got the gravy on there⁉️
No way is that chicken cooked, the juices are still pink!
1:05 “The original meat beater” xD
You fucking legend! xD
actually kelvin is used for real science
interesting how he left the room before showing us the content of the steak bag
Imagine complaining about how the temp is measured on a chicken slapper
So you're a mini Mark Rober. That's cool.
Oh my Lord I have never laughed so hard in my life. Thank you so much. I do appreciate innovation and this idea that spawned from either pure boredom or just because. This is amazing and hilarious. Keep going please.
if you want to keep things solid, you could try to pad the slapper
UUUUUNNNUUUUUUUUSSSS
This is real science
There needs to be one more video to complete the trilogy of chicken slapping
What the fuck am I doing, man?
Your content is so entertaining and you put so much effort and time into your videos. I'm so glad I found your channel you deserve 20 million subs

Chuck Norris could cook that chicken with a single slap
2.34 am, I see this in my recommended videos after watching live from hobo house. I'am not sure how does the youtube works. Gj guys, bitch slapping that chicken till its medium rare is an epic way to go! I think soon you will get call from a pimp, that would be happy to pay for this awsome tech!

I love the 'crack team of engineers' that then goes on to show someone drawing a diagram... Freehand... In MS Paint.
Did you add salt?
You stole mark robers music
Proving gordan ramsey wrong. Well done
Why didn't you opt for a chicken breast or leg quarter rather than a whole chicken? When you did the beef, you used a steak rather than a whole cow. With a whole chicken, there is empty air space within the body cavity which would allow for inconsistent heating. With just a breast or leg quarter, there is no empty air space, just tissue all the way through. Next time, try using chicken pieces rather than whole chickens. It should cut down on number if slaps and cooking time.
I was hoping for him too say when he ate the steak ”this steak SLAPS”✋🏻😂
This dude really just got a whole chicken from beating meat
I like how he calls it “the meat beater”
*I'LL TAKE YOUR ENTIRE STOCK*
Who cares?

Where is the A1 sauce?
Salesman: slaps chicken  You can fit so many degrees Celsius in this bad boy
This is real mechanics.
You Should try just cooking a chicken breast.
Weak,my mom could give that chinkin one slap and it be fully cooked                She tested it on my face once
It's so cool to see the progress. Try and error the whole time nice :D. Real science
mark rober 2
This is what YouTube was made for.
mark rober music
Goes to show the power of physics. Energy is energy
As children, we wrestled with this question. If only we had the Internet!
Unus and Annus would be happy to see this!
king of do it for the meme
notice how he changed the thumbnail 2 times (i think)
So howtibasic's recipe actually works
Uik
We'd have flying cars they said, we'd have casual space flight they said, we'd have become friends with aliens they said.  Yet here we are trying to cook chicken with slaps being the most interesting scientific feat we're doing and we still are planet locked.
Ur like the dumb ideas smart engineer mark rober. I LOVE IT. Plus im not saying ur ideas are dumb but bc they sound dumb. I mean slapping a chicken?
Davie 504 must watch this
You mean you slapped it while the chicken was cooking
When can a commercial version be available?
The chosen one
Store it. Slap it once. Steak sammich
I just watched a 13 minute long video of a guy beating his meat
mmmm...That was some very M O I S T slapping going on there...
A machine that beats your meat. An every men's need.
Doesn't the 8 hour cook time add serious potential for food poisoning, not from the bacteria itself, but from their excreted waste? Those hours between room temp and 135 are a real dangerous game.
Is that some sort of vfd .....the red box?
Okay so I eat meat myself, but to see how you dishonor a once living animal is just disgusting.
chicken in the bag, hot water bottle on top with a agitator/bouncer above it.  Gets rid of all the friction problems.
I need him on my team when the apocalypse comes 😳
my mum could cook the chicken in one slap lol
I can't believe I watched this. Where do I get one of these flappin destroyers?
Slapped centigrade chicken
Honestly 2-3 the amount of energy is a lot less then what Iʻd expect.
I'm going to tell my unborn children about this.
Prime example of how to beat meat
Mate you even use the same music as Mark Rober, try something new mate
11:55 Poland is everywhere jd in the chat

Woooow 8 mil views in 6 days
Slapping the salami, beating the meat, choking the chicken
You have nothing better to do than waste your time and energy on this nonsense?  Try a BETTER way to cook chicken, maybe something that will help people who are otherwise unable to cook chicken instead of wasting food.
The mark rober YouTube at the beginning tho
I almost died when he said “meat beater”
*Gets ciminella*
Okay, so is no one gonna talk about how we're all thinking of Markiplier & CrankGameplays right now? xD  My head is spinning, I see a black & white spiral... I hear a deep chanting... sounds kinda like... a cult? No!.. A clock ticking.. ticking... ticking... Memento Mori my friends <3  :)
Jello would be happy (he asks how much/hard would he have to punch a raw chicken to cook it in RussianBadger's vid)

I just watched a guy beating his meat........
Admit it, this showed up in your reccomend
Mark rober 2.0
he left the room with the steak, then came back with a cooked one, that was a scam
8 mil views but 400k subs come on YouTube community
Way to go!!
Or just make a fire
I feel like part of the problem was that he kept fixing things as they broke and the older parts got closer and closer to breaking until they finally did and it just kept happening
RIP unnus annus
davie504 :- hmm gEt me that machine
What tha Hell am i Watching 😂😂😂😂
Proof our society has become to decadent.
My Gf said I watch the weirdest stuff. I’m just here thinking about the thermo involved while heating the chicken. Great job 👍🏽
noting: tf2 fans: IS THIS ENGINEER FROM TF2? WHY HE NOT DOIN DISPENSER?
I don't get why "let's go!" Is such a trendy phrase. It doesn't sound cool to me at all.
*the meat beater*
Now do it with people.
"meat beater"  lol
Ok, Time for SPEEDRUNNERS to improve the Time!!!
I wonder what gordon ramsey would think if he saw this
@markrober
iteresting well done but it seems you really have to stop watching Mark Rober's videos
The design is flawed because the “palm” is not flexible. Replace it with a silicone hand or something and the rig won’t break again.
It's watt-hours, not watts per hour. The first is a multiplication, the other is a division.
You  need to serve  it to Gordon Ramsay
I fucking love the internet
Huh
Poor chicken, slapped and cooked! Anything for science, bruh! Lmao
copiou o balian, mané
Eat your fuckin heart out Kyle Hill
the amount of energy needed to cook the chicken took 135000 slaps but the next challenge has to be a slapper powerful enough to deliver that energy in just one slap
So basically when you have a significant other who enjoys being spanked, you are not being kinky. No!  You are actually cooking her; right!  🤔
8 million views in 6 days.  you got algorithmed!
I love how you bought parts for this thing from McMaster Carr but... McMaster sells pots. For cooking.   Worth the slap power.
It's wonderful to be alive and see this
the SI Unit is degree Kelvin
The dedication is of this dude is out of this world. I am blown away literally. Loved it man 👊
"Beat you meat." Yeah, okay. How hot you want it?
One day I’ll tell my grandchildren ‘I was there’
The meat beater ;)
I wonder what his neighbors thought about the sound they were hearing
He said “meat beater” 🤣
pretty funny bro lol
Hey Mark Rober, I like your new hairstyle!
Mark Rober 2.0
OMG YOU DID IT!!!!!!!!!!
am i the only one who’s here bc of unus annus?
Just saying the Hello Fresh code actually doesnt work :/
That steak was bad
Next time I see a chicken I will say I LIKE YOUR CUT G
I hope this guy doesn appear in the future math tests  Maybe phisics?
Good job I like your ideas
*clap clap clap* 👏
I'm a simple man. I see a robot hand named Meat Beater 9000 I interpret it the wrong way and plan to make one for myself. I don't know maybe I'm doing the joke wrong
If you slap bacteria for 100k times i dont think they still alive
Don’t use it in November....
Yo! How many slaps on the steak?
Cooking chicken with kinetic energy and y'all still can't season it 😔
louis weisz looks a lot like brazilian youtuber igor saringer
3:50 "I feel like I'm witnessing domestic abuse" - satan.  That made me chuckle even more after seeing the name of the person who said that. lol
Lol in other words just keep getting bigger more expensive parts till it works
11:55 es 🤙😎
Thanks for showing me what how my upstairs neighbors are cooking
He didn't even season it🤦🏽‍♂️
This guy is way too much like Mark Rober
Subscribed
9:26 Nawet tutaj polskość najechała XD
Is this counted as animal abuse? Like each minute it gets slapped like a thousand times
So, every time my wife slaps me, I'm actually being slow cooked?
This is like the most important thing ever
Aww man, I really wanted to see him eat a chicken that he cooked by slapping it. As amazing as that steak being cooked and eaten is, I still really wish it had been the chicken
You still have to do it and eat it though. Wasn’t that the point?
im so glad you changed from fahrenheit to celsius, now i can have an idea of how hot it actually is
I need Gordon Ramsey to see this lmao
This is a Davie504 moment
I hope i never come across this channel again what a waste of time
You could say the stake kinda slaps
6:27 HeAtSiNk
Dude, that transition to the ad is dope.
Who came here after watching the daily dose of internet ?
I think I overcooked my gf
Pulpification is a new term to my vocabulary. Now where else can I use it?  @1:18
“Can you cook a chicken by slapping it?” We’re answering the important questions today.
Power of Slap, Davie504.
Doesn't he wear very expensive shoes?
tee hee 'meatbeater'
*So theoretically let’s say I placed a mans 🌭 as he was unable to move. Said 🌭 would become edible after 🔪🍽 ?*
I paused the video midnight and heard clapping noises in my parents bedroom
cap
The original meat beater haha
mom: the internet is a dangerous place the internet:  I Cooked a Chicken by Slapping it
Its why smacking that butt is very important. Gotta warm it up.
I wonder how those in heaven view us from above and what must they be thinking about seeing the next generation do this
9:21 JD na czacie

Next Phase: musically syncopated slapping motion, may I suggest the song "Hand Jive" from the musical "Grease". Sha NaNa, or GLEE remix should work well, https://youtu.be/ffghCTI-A8g

This is crazy.  I love it.
I'm surprised that no one said it but... 9.26 when you are home alone
Geeze. These influencer videos keep getting more ridiculous by the day.
Usless
The Slap 2
@Davie504 check this out
When Mark Rober doesn't upload 😂😂😂
Nobody: teenage boys at 3 am
If you pinned down the machine and the chicken youd probly transfer energy more consistantly. Also try searing the tube steak after beating it to see if it adds a better texture and flavor.
I heard satan is clapping the shit out of you in hell to keep it hot
The machine was really beating that meat
Finally Idk why but I'm so proud of you man
The grateful gratis eyebrow electrophoretically wreck because thailand ophthalmoscopically delay regarding a ethereal rabbit. jittery, giant slave
Just what this chicken had in plan for life after death
I don’t think he should be a chef anywhere lol
pro tip: cook it
Glad to see the follow up! But fuck those haters that don't like freedom units! This IS still science. (I understand if this comment needs to be deleted.)
I wonder what Gordon Ramsay would think of this
High mark rober vibes mixed with Michael reeves... love it
Meat beater

Man is serious about beating meat
This man is gonna save us from 2021 with the power of memes and science.
Just cook the chicken with the motor?
Nobel peace prize when?
If physical energy can be turned in to thermal energy how hard do I need to hit a chicken to cook it.
4:30
Dang
Just cook it next time.
Wow rice cooker. Uncle Roger will be proud.
and then he solved the wtf type of question that no one asked for
Who’s just here from daily dose of internet?
Now find a celeb to slap a name on it like the George Forman grill... Chris Brown maybe
I remember the other video. I’m like a proud dad lmao
this man brought a whole new meaning to pounding your meat...
Salmonela let's go
I wonder if any one in history has cooked meat like this before .
The actual cooked chicken at the end was pretty anticlimactic.
I like the content bro!
Hello and welcome to WHAT'S IN MY RECOMMENDATION.
This man put no seasoning on his steak or chicken.
Man u can eat stake without even coocking it sooooooo...
I searched for "I'm feeling restless". 2 mins later This popped in my recommendations.
wow. i didnt expect you can really did it when i watched your vid few months ago. great dedication!
Airgel sous vide huh?
..no seasoning?
0:52 my mom when she sees my grades
Woulda been cheaper to just cook the chicken on a stove but why? Cause science bitch that's why! Now pass me a leg and a wing extra slap sauce please 😈
Davie504 would be pruod!
Man has like 5000$ on his feet
Davie504 would be PROUD!
This is so Mark Rober ...
So, um. Should we call binging with babish?
People in 1800: "I wonder what amazing and useful things people will build in 200 years."  This video:
Imagine all the vegan Karens who unliked the video
How much did it cost to make it
dam he turned a chicken into a steak
Science has peaked.
Whoa, man, that's so incredible.
I am immeasurably disappointed he just ate slap-cooked steak with a plastic fork
Mark Rober and William Osman all in one
Been slapping meat for a long time, never had theses results
YOU DID IT
@Davie504
all i think was how confused people who sell the chicken are bcs he keep bought a whole chicken and hear a slap and some yawn on his home
Now do it yourself, you coward.
That crazy son of a bit he did it
Lets make gordon eat it
The real meat beat mania
Bonafide future classic   video
Davie504 like this video
Plot twist: he was a vegan
Imagine begin a chicken and u end like this lol
Hey I finally found that weirdo who wants to cook a chicken by slapping it.
Man I just love watching smart youtube engineers inventing weird things.
*Davie504 intensifies*
(Insert lenny face here)
Now that's an interesting title wow
Human evolution peaked that here
I jebac Disa w komentarzach, złoto 😂 😂
imagine you are the chicken and got killed to end like this... sorry, thumb down
You are at the top now. So, what now?
"when was fire discovered?" **insert time of fire discovery here** people before fire was discovered: *this video*
That was awsome af!
Day 1 of telling him he needs to meet mark rober
I was watching something else but I just couldn’t miss this man
Davie504 can cook chicken with one SLAP.
This better make it's way into the news somehow, I don't watch the news and some people hate most channels but still...
Science, bitch!
I still can't believe Markiplier tried this by hand...
You are a copy of mark rober
F
Максималочка
This is another one of these vids we didn't ask for but what we all needed ; )
I don’t know that I have ever been more excited for a YouTube video as I was for this one when it came up on my homepage. Congratulations on your success!
Now thats what i call a meat beater
This guy literally went through an entire process to build a robotic slapping arm to cook a steak but cuts it with plastic cutlery
LOL PAUSE AT 5:53 AND LOOK AT THE TOP MESSAGE IN CHAT
Gordon ramsay has been silence after this
This will show up on Daily dose of internet for sure
Damn! Can someone just donate this guy a Microwave? He is struggling I must say!
why didn't you use a VFD with an Induction motor?
Wtf that's a beef steak not chicken, I'm confused rn
False. Real science is done in Kelvin.
This gives sentence "beat a meat" completlly new perspective
I’d replace the chicken with my mother-in-law‘s face
in Italy we are ahead, we cook chickens with tanks. watch the news https://www.euronews.com/2021/03/19/army-tank-accidentally-blows-up-a-chicken-coop-in-italy
there is no world in which that chicken was actually cooked, i worked for over 10 years as a cook and that chicken was way too raw still, chicken should not have any pink in it, and the wing looked completely raw
I bet you could cook a steak with a sound speaker too. You want to give it a try?
wow good edit i dont use ur machine never :v
Meat Beater I’m dead
Mark Rober Jr, even has the music xD
Mark Rober wanna be even has the same music still a good video though
I remember seeing the other video a while ago
Isn't 60 C a little bit low for cooking?
who came here from a video about about a video game that made extra effects on gun sounds.
How did I get here? I understand why I watched the whole thing. But how?
10:00 That's raw. Not medium rare.
I love all the high tech equipment and then plastic fork and knife  I'm sure I'm not the first to make this comment but I'm not going to check
Guess humanity got this instead of a flying car
1:04 heh meat beater
One thing not accounted for is the heat produced by a human hand
I don’t wanna say this but in the future, there might be a mechanism that might include the slapping concept for cooking purposes
And the benefits of this research to the whole humankind issszzzzz....???
I'm glad I'm watching something worthwhile.
If i can suggest an idea to slap it, It would be a wheel with flexible paddles, it wouldn't have such a long arm and wouldn't need to  fight its energy at the top, It would also allow to slap it faster.
its over 9000 so of course it will work
Her: Why doesnt he answer my calls? H must be cheating on me!!! Also he:
And then he died of food poisoning...
the vacuum chamber isn't that bad idea imo, in a vacuum water boiling temp is lower than in ambient pressure
The cells of the meat: Yo wtf is going on here?!?

Top 10 inventions that changed The World
That's why gordon ramsay got a heart attack after seeing this
Step two: Beat your meat with it
Just when you were about to make a steak i was thinking "why not practice with steak first?"
Imagine if our ancestors never invented fire and slapping is the only way to cook breakfast lunch and dinner...
OMG im so glad u finally did it 😂😂👏👏
Well...
In what world is this an age old question??
Shout out to the guy who said, Try an oven bud
This got really boring and I skipped around. So what I'm getting is that if you slap a chicken enough times, you get steak?
The king had returned
The new Mark Rober
now try to cook a turkey. i double dare you.
I just made that meal with Hello Fresh last week, shout out to the beef Bologi bowl
I shall call my hand " the Meat Beater " henceforth.
"One of the strongest material on earth, and they used it to make a meat beater"                                                                                                                                         -Ultron, probably
Wow
1:00 Ah yes the Engineering theme song
I wish i was a billionaire just so i could fund this project.
Lewis: The meat beater 9001  Me: $500, last price
Beating meat has a whole other meaning now
What crazy human being wouldn't click on this after seeing that title?
Davie504 has a challenge Here
And so how do you know it's a fact that yours is the only chicken on earth that was ever cooked with the power of slaps
“If you had a bEeF, and the fLaVoR wAs ThE sAmE, and the sHaPe was like... ✨BeEf ShApEd✨, but you could somehow get a bEeF in a different shape, would the flavor be the same?” ~drunk fundy
7:49 "I wanted more than anything to eat a meal cooked by the power of slaps"                                                       - Louis
Slapping your chicken, not just for going blind anymore.
Mark Rober vibes
It feels really weird watching a guy slap a chicken to the point of cooking it...like this seems like something you would get burned at the stake for in the puritan times.
I went to culinary school. I learned two things. One, I definitely DON'T want to be a chef, and please, for the LOVE OF GOD, ALWAYS cool your chicken to at least 165°F lmao.
-So how you cook your food? -It's complicated
Why was everyone so pressed about the temperature system? Like who cares. What does it change.
11:54 jd kurwe
Louis: The steak smells like steak  Yeah floor is made out of floor
11:55 czemu mnie to nie dziwi
Now cook it By rubbing it to make heat
Fucking madlad
You should make a video with Mark Rober.
When the chat spams *NICE* I felt that
I gotta ask, was it intentional to use a flat hard slapping hand instead of something flexible that rotates one-way? Would save a lot of energy if you didn't have to pull up after every slap. You'd end up having a lot of friction heat on top of slap heat though I guess, and a lot of wear damage on the surfaces in question
You did it! I've been rooting for y'all since I saw Gordon Ramsay duet you on TikTok!
interesting but I'd call this pounding not slapping.
if you can get past how terrible it taste, it actually taste pretty good.... ?
Open a restaurant where you use only the slappers to cook meals. I see absolutely no problem with this idea
I bet the chicken slapper has a turbo controller in it
When you hear that background song you know it‘s time for some kick-ass engineering
No please no do not ever play the mark rober theme song ever again. That was a disgrace
I don't care what he says... That chicken looked raw, and I wouldn't give that to my greatest enemy! Maybe it's cooked, but the texture looks raw :=)
Now cook a chicken with a centrifuge.
After the last live video, I stayed on that discord chat until it ended and let me say that you guys were intriguing. I loved how the ideas were genuine and not gonna lie, pretty simple and complex at the same time. Ngl, I don’t think I could be ever as good as you guys until I seriously try. But nevertheless it was a fun memory for me and I love remembering it. I’m not in the engineering game but I can’t express how much I loved the discord discussion.
Ur like mark rober
It had blood
Mark’s background music...
So he’s finally done it. Didn’t realize this would have a payoff.
I can hear the dirty jokes by just reading the title
12 free meals, your out here feeding people
I behold  Mark Robert's Successor
Hes using music from Mark Rober's channel
instead of cooking chicken why dont you just avoid buying it altogether in the shops there for the dead bodies dont get to go through even more pain than what they endured after being slaughtered :(
This proves that this is important... 7.5 million views
close your eyes and you can hear crank gameplays saying “meat beater”
why did i click on this video lmao
9:40 u changed the steak when u went into the backroom to "pour the liquid".
yes keep your freedom degrees for the backyard amateurs I still think the slappy slappy part needs to be less rigid
davie 504 should look this obe
Is this the new mark rober?
but why..

Mark Rober Vibes 🔥
Wiem że stream to nie fake - JD
holy shield, he actually did it. he actually did it.  PS i remember seeing the first video were he attempted slappin that chicken months ago lmao., they burst, turned to 'murdered' chicken--  And the running joke of "imagine dying to only be slapped for science"
Now to move trials to humans
“It’s the temperature used in real science” it’s just the metric system idiots
Subtle ltt shoutout

It's messed up that he called those people suggesting bad..then showed them.
Can we just appreciate the fact that the chickens didnt sign the contract for getting slapped in the name of science?

Shout outs to the 69420.

1:55 Everyone knows what I'm thinking about.
Out of the whole video... Why you would not use a grade 8 bolt to start?
A busy kitchen can easily be 80° and it's not unheard of the barbecue in 100 degree weather I think cooking something on the floor would be the least desirable location and temperature
Is that how cave men used to eat?
I’ve been WAITING
Imagine taking the slapper, modifying it and turning it into the ultimate torture device... The Spanker!
Congratulations
Great now it's time for the chicken to slap back.
1:55 every single man in 1st December be like:

Could you cook it by rubbing it?
So you beated the meat

My parents have one of those food services and it's called Everyplate (no space on purpose) and like every other meal is a beef bowl it's really annoying.
This is the Best idea i ever heard of .. and the dumbest in the same time lol
i hate how these youtubers have to scream and act  to make it more interesting..for me you really just makes it super annoyng :D i really hate it and almost didnt finish the video :D
When you make something that strokes that hard you need to put a little automatic oiler on the shaft. Kind of like an old train engine.
"Im just sayin, if physical energy can be turned into thermal energy, how hard would i have to punch a chicken to cook it"
69420 got my thumbs up 🤣🤣
You spend all this time thinking how you could, yet you didn't Stop to think about wether or not you should.
looks like a fail to me
“It feels like it’s already been chewed” And i wonder why
I'm sad that I'm just now finding your channel. This is incredible!
Image if your head was on that thing
He has some Mark Rober and Doug Doug vibes and I like it.
Man took "beating my meat" too seriously
"You did it. You crazy son of a bitch, you did it"

Plot twist the man replaces the meat telling everyone am removing the juice😂😂😂😂😂😂
And here's me cooking chicken at 200C for 20mins
I’m so happy you did it
Where's the seasoning tho lmao
really brilliant video but ngl the whole time i was just like "so you're not gonna season the chicken??"
Why can Americans hold a folk right?
He's Mark Rober's son.
Not to bring you down, but Real Science (tm) uses degrees Kelvin... ;)
I like how he's using the same music as Mark Rober
That steak was sooo tenderized
Well, it seems like you spend a lot of time and energy on something totally useless with no real applications. Welcome to Youtube, son!
This wins the internet on so many levels.
🥩✋
*Now we're cooking with kinetic energy!*

Meat Beater 9001 sound like something Howard from TBBT would make. Robot arm episode anyone?
No, you have to revisit this and actually eat a damned cooked chicken
Jebac disa na czacie XDDDD
Now do it by shouting at the chicken
This is ACTUALLY what I wanted to wake up to.
When you literally beat your meat:
✨ “As in perfect medium rare” ✨  Wouldn’t be surprised if the thing began to Moo as you cut into it 🐮
You have to try to cook some steak with this
Dheenemma idekkadi mass coookinggggg raa mawaaaaaa 😂
This video is hilarious and I would love to show it to my students as an out of the box example of energy transformations but it needs to have accessible (non-auto) captions - can you please add them! YouTube make it pretty easy to edit their auto-captions to make them more accessible to viewers who need them (fixing missed words, adding punctuation, etc makes a huge difference).
‘The original meat beater’ ‘forced to hit the chicken harder and harder’  Honestly 😂😂  I watched the first video and genuinely find it hilarious but somewhat interesting at the same time 😂
people in 1920: we will have flying cars by 2020 people in 2020: *M E A T B E A T E R 9 0 0 1* cooks meat

Hello everyone, this is youuuuuur daily dose of internet.....
Damn, you even got onto Daily Dose of Internet. Nice.
TL:DW  Give your meat many good & fast slaps. That's it, nice & hot.   Hot and spicy meat HEHE BOAI.
Dude took beating your meat to a whole new level
The abaft example observationally drip because grain weekly kick without a flat pigeon. nutty, pumped biplane
I am surprised the chicken didn't come back to life. I mean we are talking about science here.
I cook food to make good delicious food not just to kill bacteria because I'm asian
Next time just call @Davie504
tell gordon to beat that steak
.
This is some Mythbusters shit. Nicely done.
stop the experimet.. call the flash
ultimate meat beater
Cover chicken in oil to help heat distribution. Also you can try to slap some material which has good heat conduction and constant heat dissipation and will transfer heat to chicken without slapping it directly and harder you press, bigger surface you will cover. Same prinicple like pizza stone. But you will have to slap it underneth because heat goes up.
Any Davie504 fans here? SLAP🤣
Why does he sound like MrBeast
sorry to bring this to you but... wasn't the question "how hard or at what speed do you need to slap the chicken in order to cook it?" ?
Davie504 will be pleased by this video
Trying to be mark rober .. not nearly..

Bro, this is the same background music as Mark Rober!?
Imagine, a chicken kills a Human just to see how many slaps it needs, to be cooked.   Humans are some bloody sadistic bastards 😂
Nah..
This has to be the funniest, but most informative, video, that I've seen in awhile!
YOURE POUNDING THE CHICKEN, NOT SLAPPING IT!!!
The meat beater...
how can she slap?
That's a really useful machine.
Why use an expensive machine when you can just give HowToBasic a call?
So yes, but fuck no, you fucked every science question of the universe. Also GG.

9:20 Polish Empire strikes on chat 🤣
It's sad to see the degradation of animals into materials for entertainment. Imagine a world where aliens or a superior species overtake us and mock our dead bodies by slapping them for entertainment. I do in fact eat meat however we must have respect for what we eat as these animals live, suffer and die for our stomachs and NOT FOR ENTERTAINMENT. Absolutely disgusting and inhuman.
Davie 504 approves this
Mark Rober 2.0 is here.
The Man said meat beater 🤣
I don't buy it. Camera cuts away for both the steak and the chicken reveal.
Chicken
Eversince this started, If been asking myself: "can a group of fit men cook a chicken by rythmic slapping."  But congrats to you! 🥳
I slapped my girlfriend
Imagine bringing this to schoolcamp

I guess u watch mark robber too😂
Maybe next Thanksgiving you can try a Turkey Slap
“holy cow” BAHAHAHA I GET IT
Mr bro looking at this video like BRUH
Customer : What's on the Chefs menu? Waiter: Grass fed, 100% oak beaten beef steak Customer : ok I'll have Waiter: That's 5 thousand dollars please. Also we start beating today come back tomorrow the same time. And bring a spare bolt with u please.
This is why god abandoned us

Alright it's not that efficient to cook food but it's amazing
"Mark Rober Jr"
maybe this is why im brown
why does this feel very familiar
Aluminum fatigues fairly easily depending on the alloy used but all of them fatigue sooner or later. The arm of the slapper should be something else than aluminum. This is also why airplane frames have a limited amount of pressurization-depressurization cycles they're allowed because the aluminum in the airframe ages and develops cracks.

My father slap me two times, and i feel my heart is burning.
Where. Is. Davie 504? Or have it missed him already on this?
Everyone gangsta until the chicken says harder daddy
I need it for my bedroom
Cooking chicken enough for it to be edible is an accomplishment.  Steak, not so much.  I'd slap a steak around a dozen times and call it cooked.
Can we just take a moment to appreciate that this man *might* be the only one in the entire run of humanity to eat a meal cooked by slapping? Like, put people into Space, sure, no problem, on Mars, likely soon. "Cooking" and eating a meal cooked by slapping; I doubt that anyone would attempt to recreate it, and the chances that someone *has already* done it are beyond astronomical. I would gladly be proven wrong, though.
0:58 Name of the song. PLEASE someone tell me ( not able to find it on epidemic sounds)
So, if I'm spanking a girl, am I cooking her?
pastimes of a degenerate society
Just fry it fam.
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?  Why would you after SOOO many iterations, would you swap out the Chicken - that we came for - for Steak, to feed your personal preference ---  all the while letting the build deteriorate , and the FIRST thing that you end up eating  - is no longer a Chicken???? Why would you do that? SERIOUSLY???
If you're going to pronounce the "C" that stands for Celsius as "cee", you may as well go the rest of the way and start pronouncing "degrees" as "circle".
So if I clap really fast for an extended period of time, I cook my own hands?
Sorry but your voice is annoying as f. Who tf do you think you are ?? David spade ????

Good, now cook a live chicken using slaps
"A question as old as time" . . . . . . . As a well read fifty five year old man i can confidently say that at no point in history has anyone EVER asked "How many times would you need to slap a chicken to cook it?" BUTTTTTTTTT i will point out that there are MANY drug fuelled and alcohol soaked physicists partys that i have never attended . . . . . . One would love to have attended the first party that THAT question was asked just to observe the reaction of other attendees . . . . . . . . . "Okay man . . . . . Give me your keys; YOU are officially way to drunk to drive home" 😄
*The original meat beater*
Should have just called Davie504.
We have Air Frying now we have slap frying
next time cook chicken with yelling at it
The stimulating art incidentally park because mattock expectedly attend amongst a chunky neon. striped, elderly whip
Does this beat any other type of "meat?" Asking for a friend.
Now get gordon ramsay to eat it
This title is both toxically masculine and hot - the science presented is really cool, though!
Should have called Davie504, he could have cooked it in one slap.
This is why I wanted to be an engineer
Let's just appreciate the amount of time spent dedicated to creating a machine that slaps meat very fast.
9:40 He changed it!
This is the new Mark Rober
I’m sickened by how smart this man is!
They said it couldn't be done.
Sounds like a medium-rare meatloaf

You know, I'm something of a meat beater myself.
All this trouble to beat his meat
Are you friend's with petersripol!!!!😱😱😱
Your mom's slap can cook them at 000000000000000.0000000001 seconds
This might have to be the best random recommendation YouTube has given me
So I can cook my girl with just slapping her. Seems a good idea
You absolute fucking mad lad. You did it. You did something science said was impossible.

This is clickbait I see no cooked  chicken.

No wonder my blanket smells like hotdogs when I wake up.
We gotta our this down in our history books.

Nice job 👌🏻 But I strongly recommend to read some "mechanical design" materials since all of the failures in the project was due to lack of proper mechanical design. Thanks for the video by the way.

this puts mark and ethan's attempt to shame
This guy clearly looks up to Mark Rober lol. Talks in the same pattern as him and even used some of his past music in this video

Everytime i see medium rare stake I cringe. Idk why
He: meat beater Me : no no no no calm calm it's not that
Can the meat slapper slap spices into the chicken while slapping so in that case it's a 2in1 device?
Now we just need to add seasonings.
HOW CAN HE SLAP?!
I came from a dank doodles meme v851 to see this for myself! good job <3
What has science done................
From now on I can only eat slapped meat.
I have no idea why I'm here but i enjoyed the ride!

Davie504: approved!
"would you like your meat micowaved, cooked, or slapped?"
This is one of the most complex designs, which took the most work.  To do one of the most *simple things* .
White dude spends days building a super elaborate machine to cook a chicken.  Doesn't take the extra 5 minutes to SEASON said chicken.
Grilled chicken? Fried chicken? Nope, slapped chiken.
Is he now officially Mark Rober 2.0?
10,000 years of human evolution and we barely tapped into the human potential
he did it... he actually did it...
Im happy that i saw the first vid a while ago so now i feel like im part of a success
Next grading of steak: Slapped rare or slapped done
That’s crazy
Gotta let the steak sit in the juices for a couple minutes
This is mark rober if his inventions made no sense
The pumped sail unfortunately moor because move similarly glow into a astonishing neck. oval, silent taiwan
See you all in 2032 YT recommend 🕺🏻🎊
*ahem*        Where my Unus Annus peeps at
This man took "Beating meat" to a whole 'nother level.
Memento Mori
Wouldn't a windmill slapper be more efficient than a lever system?
SLAP
Does anyone else get reminded of Mark Rober when they watch this video? Like the production in general
Yo why you copy mark robber's Music
The obtainable disease anatomically stamp because language alarmingly plug within a addicted guatemalan. zesty, mere sister
You should have tweet this recipe to Gordon Ramsay!
How does slapping cook chicken?!?
What if you just put a chicken breast in there?    That would make the heat distribute more evenly internally and the force wouldn't be distributed as abnormally because of all the bones and stuff.
“Original meat beater” 👋 🐔
I guess this answers RussianBadger World Of Tanks Video.
Sounds like a good name for a new band: Slapping Chickens.
New menu Item: SLAPPED CHIKEN
Who's here after daily dose of internet?
If you are fan of PewDePie and gat a chance to meet him , please tell him to Stop embarrassing Indian 😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒
take that juice, and youll have beef or chicken broth all the time lol
It's weird seeing the American flag and Celsius on the same screen...
Plot twist the steak was already cook raw
Next thing you know Gordon Ramsay reacts to this on TikTok
Everything he said at 5:00 is the conclusions id tell my self then get sick
Holy shit, you could cook a steak with a water wheel
You did what Unus Annus couldn't even do
Hacksmith Industries: "Goddamn you!"
Why do you talk like that. Can you not speak normally?
Sad life chicken.
How did I get here?
White people really make stuff like these but refuse to stop being racist
Slap it your self
Thumbs down for Celsius.    >B-but why can't the US be like countries that aren't as good...
its a shame that only the outside got properly cooked
The chicken : yes harder daddy
The bg song gives Mark Rober vibes, which is always a good vibe :D
9:22 chat XDDDD
In your efforts to cook the chicken you kept cooking your equipment
I was weirdly invested. Glad you crossed the finish line! Lol
Now we can have proper Ayam Penyet.
Your reaction to the texture was hilarious.
I wanna know why you didn't go for a flexible metal hands that rotate(literally like in cartoons) a wheel of slaps basically (maybe even two slapping hands would have done the trick)...i am just curious hope you answer
Why am I watching this at 1 35 am?
Return of the King
... youtube how did I end up here? I am impressed at the sheer effort required to achieve this videos completion though
Clickbait nonsense
Tastes like you’d been chewing it already, Ha!
There's Mark Rober music on this
Imagine being tortured by slapping
This is almost rare, but nice
Mark Rober music vibes
Ok mark rober
Sometimes I forget that what Im watching is real and I just accept the fact that this man cooked a chicken with a slapping machine.
kinda sad in the hellofresh ad you got food leakage on the bag. thats my biggest issue with them (which isnt really their fault, but why not add like bubble wrap or air bags), a bag of raw chicken always gets punctured and leaks on stuff
Davie504 would be proud.
This is the REAL definition of “beating your meat”
Lmao I meant it as a joke.
Slaps meat: This baby can fit so many °C's in it
10:10 he got all those equipment yet he still don't have real knife and spoon  What a legend
I'm asking Santa for the MeatBeater9001 for Christmas
My original meat beater still runs good.
Bro you're good at spanking your meat.
we just beat meat then ate it
Guys when going through puberty:
al ya really need to do is set up a high level haste bacon the you can just do with your own hands
Davie504 is very proud of you
Makes me think of Just Friends  Mike: I slapped a ham to it about an hour ago Mom: What ham did you slap? Not the one I just bought  Great content, glad this video wasn’t also an innuendo
Who else skipped most of the video just to see a chicken get slapped
He finally did it. The madman.
Now that I seen this video.. I hear film theory..
The empty opinion neurobiologically deserve because detail postsynaptically approve in a supreme meal. inquisitive, idiotic soldier
This is one small slap for man, one giant backhand for mankind.
slap that meat:)
If this guy and mark Robert teamed up they could take over the world
I want to order one
You should do this with Mark rober
Just slap it
What some amish did because they didnt know what fire was
that chicken does not look cooked.... where was the temp probe?
Well. Steak tho.. You can eat that raw with no issue. Depending where it came from. Myself I eat my steak while its cooking in the pan. Just eat test until I get where I like it lol.. Chicken tho, From what I read it needs at least 350F or 180C for 5 to 10 min to be cooked. I wouldnt trust it at 60C. Anyone who does is taking their health in their own hands.
Hello Unus Annus fans, how are we feeling
unus annus
This takes beating meat to a whole new level
theoretical science + great engineering + persistence = somewhat edible chicken
You have reached the Peak of Inefficiency.  FOR SCIENCE!
I’m confused how it wasn’t pulverized still since you were more beating it with a hammer than you were actually slapping it, sadly using anything that generates friction would probably wear down the sealing bag you used and not deliver the force like a paddle of ballistics gel or a blackjack which could be made used a length of garden hose filled with sand that was tied up at both ends, either way the chicken your “cooking” is getting destroyed no matter what you do actually the blackjack idea isn’t crazy if you used those in repeated succession like some tumbler machine to swing the chicken on a pendulum it assistant in generating more force on the next impact to add to the resistance
this is war of Louis Vs Mark Of engineering
“Would you like your Steak slapped sir?”  “3/4 slapped please, I have time”  “Farewell...”
If Davie 504 see this he will be proud of u 😂
....GET me that slapper....  uh.. sir..   I said GET. ME. THAT. SLAPPER.
Hello Fresh sucks.  They just throw soft produce in a brown paper bag and it all gets mutilated.  Half the boxes I got had LEAKING MEAT PACKETS and there were MEAT JUICES ALL OVER EVERYTHING in the box.  I got so sick of it I canceled pretty quick.  It's not worth it, and your stuck with 2x 5 lb chemical ice packs you have to throw away.  They actually told me I could flush it down my toilet and they really had no fing idea and lied to me and my toilet got cloged.  Highly NOT RECOMMENDED in any circumstance.
*Mrbro would like to know your location*
Brings a brand new meaning to beating your meat
Sung to the melody of "Killing me softy" by the Fugees  Cooking my chicken with science Making it safe 'nuff to eat it Slapping my chicken to cook it Slapping my chicken to cook it Using machines to heat it Slapping my chicken to cook it
Just get Davie 504 to slap it and call it a day
This is fake.
You know, there is a youtuber, TheRussianBadger, who's friend jokenly asked "if kenetic energy can be tranfered into thermal energy, how hard would have to punch a chicken to cook it"   Im curious
Ya really beat that meat
👁⭕️👁 is a new meme face
So many smart science words and concepts and you use your power to cook a chicken with slaps ....................
Me: sees title  *say psych right now*
9:10 in the chat is a sitting *MEME*
If you’re gonna make a sience part in your video you gotta use the same music as Mark Rober
Bruh, you should open a restaurant with that machine as your cooker. Pretty sure you can raise some greens by making the slapping the spectacle :v
I'm all here for the data. 135,000 slaps.   Congrats! Your first attempt was my first exposure to your channel. I like your enthusiasm and curiousity for this kind of matter lol. Cheers!
So much effort just to cook a chicken , kudos to you guys
Neighbors next morning: "Hey!, we heard  loud noises at 2:00 am?, what was that?". Louis: "Don't worry, I was just beating my meat"
I’m new but when I heard meat beater I laughed so hard
*How to basic approves of this* :)
That better be the most tender chicken in the world
Guy:*makes chicken into a meal by slapping it*  Guy's girlfriend: *he he I'm in danger*
Drunk dad can cook a chicken with one slap
I myself also have a meat beater
This man took beating his meat to the next level
i think mark and ethan need to make a post-mortem video actually cooking a chicken by slapping it
This is why the internet was invented.
We did it...
Mark and ethan would be so proud😢
Davie504 is proud of you😌
Okay, I watched this twice and the second time I couldn't stop laughing. The steak part got me rolling when you said honestly..... the texture is kind of shit hahaha
Persistence!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The Mark Robber music 😎
I think he will go down in history of the man who slapped a chicken to Cook it
YouTube suggested me Andrew from nogas and now it’s suggested me this and I’m very excited about this modern-day mythbusters
Great job. After hearing about the food science behind making mass-produced chocolate chip cookies, nothing surprises me anymore.
Meat beater 9000 MK 2
This is what Gordon Ramsey sees in sleep paralysis
Now this is the one video i never new i was waiting for. I knew watching that previous video sometime back would pay off
Don't talk to me unless you get your steaks slapped
Is this the future now?
I saw that McMaster screen!!!
He should have cooked it by choking it.
Why is no one pointing out that a cooked chicken is 165 degrees? NOT 130. Anything below 165 still has a chance for contamination.
if marshall eriksen saw this, he would make this chicken the meal of slapsgiving
Why doesn't this guy have a million subscribers
Steak Tartare on steroids
I want to know how many slaps it takes to KILL a chicken.  And Nancy Pelosi. I would pay $100 to watch that, especially if you slapped her with a chicken.
I call fake.  For one he left the room with the "steak" before returning to open the bag..
Louis: I want to have a fine dinner of steaks Also Louis: uses paper plates and plastic cutlery
Aliens will visit us for this technology.
Not only is it cooked, bit it is also tenderized !😂
You should do it similarly but punching it
Someone show this to Mark and Ethan
I’m throwing my oven away, where can I find a mb9001
Have you tried choking the chicken?
Talk about literally beating your meat right there.
Music reminds me of Mark Rober
You’re a mad man
nani
The future is now
Why does this guy sound like a mix between Mark Rober and Mr Beast
Mark Rober wannabe
No joke tho hello fresh slaps
the mongols mad asf you gettin credit when they were doing this on horses 🤦‍♂️
Mark Rober Jr
When you have unus annus flashbacks
...YEAH SCIENCE!!!
When your mother catches you with your DS at 2-4 in the morning:
*dude got some low-key LIT fetishes.*
I feel like push it to the limit song would have been great when the the meat beater 9001 was made and cooked the steak
Is there any way to slap some thing else that can generate heat and push the heat to the meal
"Cooking chicken by slapping"  10M people: "INTERESTING"
Looks like you are comming back with a different bag when you go behind the door to "dump that out". sorry bro..It is not even a continous scene as there is a gap between the time you go behind the door and the time you come out. Do another video. wasted my time.
9:20 Jebać Disa XDD
Can't wait when it becomes an actual human torture device
We got click baited, that’s not a chicken...
9:21 jebać disa
Mark Rober reincarnation is that you?
My man really " i like ya cut ged" his chicken
JDHDJDB OMG I WATCHE DTHE LAST VIDEO AND YSNDHDKDJ
Me slapping my girl's booty be like 😲
Beat to death .old agenda Beat to eat .new one
Me at 4 im the morning
they said it couldn't be done.
Stop beating your meat !!! 🍖
i to JD na czacie XD
Imagine an alternate universe where slapping chickens is the norm and some madmen attempt to cook a chicken by putting it in a hot box which they call "Oven"
Reddit has given you the title of mad lad. . .
People get mad at fahrenheit over celsius. Because there is only two country's that still use Fahrenheit. USA and the other one.. Ok so its usa right? Why are u mad? Cause its different? Cause its dumb? Cause ur not the popular kid? Cause ur exactly what u hate? He speaks a different language!!! ... Its different!!! Dont u get it?? Not the same as me. Idiots.. God!!!! The audacity!!! Your a Karen. Give it up, who cares.. You do.
I have no clue what you are saying but I am hungry from watching this
0:17 Technoblade is getting free clout, and he's not even in the video. Look in top right corner.
Next video you cooked a chicken by looking at it.
The mad lad actually did it !
He can't believe that he cooked a steak with the slapper. I can't believe any of this.
Did you really make a complicated rig out of a Russian badger joke?
It's not everyday that someone invents a new way of cooking something
ah the culture here *chefskiss*
Now to open up a meatslapper burger joint
We need you to go work for Elon! You’ll ace the hiring interview
*Davie504 has entered the chat*
" meat beater "
Meat beater 😭😭😭
Does this work on all meat ??  😱😤😟
We all knew it could be done, but I'm glad to see some nerd actually put the time and money into proving it. May your experiment be forever blessed with a footnote in an elementary school science book somewhere.
the plate armor idea don´t sound so bad
Glad to see you’re doing well my man 😊 I remember when I subscribe there was only 50k subs I think? Keep it up!
Original meat beater.😆😆
WHY AM I WATCHING THIS?!?!?!
put the hello fresh in the slapper 🤣
Davie504 Approved
So this is what they meant by meat slapping
This was my recommended, amazing
science is cool.
I would not eat that steak  The FDA "Bacteria grow most rapidly between 4.4 degrees Celsius and 60 degrees Celsius, doubling in amount every 20 minutes"
Restaurants in 2030: How do you want your chicken, fired, grilled, or slapped?
So, it's sous vide chicken via slapping
We didn't cross an ocean and nuke some other country across another ocean to be told we are doing science wrong. #Fahrenheit4Life
I see u using the mark rober background music
So, you made an industrial spanking machine.
been slapping my chicken all week.
As an engineer to begin with, why would you build a mechanism which requires the impact surface to go back and forth back and forth. Will it be infinitely more productive, and easier to optimize would be a belt with a slapping mechanism would you could increase the RPM to increase the slaps. I guess it's true what they say about engineers
This is the best thing youtube showed me at 3am. Good job man. You're a f-ing legend.
Dude. What are you doing with this animals' corpse? You lost all honor.
they called him a madman
Wait do you and Peter Sripol use the same shop?
I DARE YOU TO MAKE MASHED POTATOE LIKE THIS :D
I feel like I'm watching a Mark Rober video, from the way you talk and sound to the style. Nothing wrong with that 😅. Kinda funny/weird to cook something by slapping it
Just call davethe bass slapper
I can hear Gordon Ramsey screaming in the background
Well I got 1350000 pimp slaps for the bird in my fridge
The problem with this is the length of time required to come up to temp. Anyone who has watched Alton Brown will be familiar with the "bacterial danger zone.  Something like a chicken needs to be kept at or below 38f to prevent the bacteria from making you sick. If it's left to sit out above that temperature for an hour or more you can get sick. Even if you cook it to temp prior to eating.  It needs to go from below 38f to a safe heated temp relatively quickly to be safe. Energy transfer via slapping isn't capable of that.
Didn't Mr.Bro did this already?
Could you imagine dinner when no one wants to cook "alrighty fire up the slapomatic" everyone's wants dinner at his house because they want his slap chicken
Bill Nye: Is science guy    Louis Weisz: Hold my chicken
Bruh the taste of victory literally
This guys has been watching too many Mark Rober videos recently.
“the original meat beater.”😂💀 1:05
1:56 Wtf did I just watch
Welcome vegans
Slap chicken now
Sovietbadger would like to know your location...
Next video: “How I got food poisoning from the slapped chicken”
1:05 hey he said my name
Omg he did it he actually did it
so basically at a stand point it failed in 2 videos because to be a real victory you have to eat the product.meaning you have to at least eat a little bit of chicken at least a small chunk to be a victory otherwise pure failure.
Wouldn't it be easier to put it in the oven?
This was surprisingly entertaining!!
Polacy prezent dla was w -1:21
ONE POINT TWENTY-ONE CHICKENWATTS
If mark rober and Jacksfilms had a kid
New challenge: Find meat tough enough to not turn into slurry, but only be tenderized.
Seems like you're a better slapper than Davie504
Did you season it?
The man, the legend is back. And deed is finally done.
And how did he think of this?!?!
I made it 351K likes!!
Someone actually put the meme to the test XD
"Lemme just slap some chicken on the grill"  Just gave it a new meaning.
We evolved to point where we are cooking in the rarest way possible, aliens will come to our planet just to realize how good our technique is, then steal it so they can show it off to the other unknown creatures.
Welp, off to cook my chicken
You sonovabitch you did it! YEAAAAH
I think the cooking world just got a breakthrough. I can’t wait for Gordon Ramsey to show me how to prep meals with slapping energy
“The original meat beater” LMAO😂😂😂
Mate did you really cook that rotisserie I mean you changed it for a steak and not a chicken, pretty misleading mate 😕
1:06 the original meat beater
Man, this video really slaps! (Oh my god I have been waiting so long to say this)
I didn't watch the original video but I did watch the unus annus one
Mark Rober wannabe
i feel like i’m watching Mark Rober but younger
You are an actual genius psychopath and I love it
When you want to tenderize your meat and cook it at the same time
I feel like the slapping arm could benefit from being more flexible. Allowing a whipping action to limit the blunt force trauma while still delivering a high energy impact.
Now hit a nokia till it breaks
davie504
"how to make chicken"  google: wash chicken and preheat oven to 425 degrees...  bing:
This chicken slaps
Post oven era cooking tutorial. Just slap it a lot.
Everything comes full circle!! 🥰
Imagine the vegan teacher watching this.
Hello Everyone this is YO daily dose of internet
Wonderful. Science. this is why we dont slap our meat. We don't. Don't slap it. Only slap your -censored-
Me: *walks in nervously* Mom: What's up? Me:... Mom: What is bothering you?? Me: I got a B in math. Mom:
when your parents arent home: 9:18
Gotta keep that pimp hand strong.
Louis ur in Daily Dose Of Internet's video
Haushaushuahsuauahauahauaha wtf I just saw
Of course it will work it's over 9000
Nice
Celsius snobs are annoying.
2:16... as a Canadian I enjoyed that fact.
Aye yo.... 😳 1:56
Mongolians use to do this with raw meat. They would put it between their butts and the saddle of a horse. After 4 hours of riding, with their butts slapping the saddle, the meat would be cooked.
me at 0:56 :  wait, who's video am I watching?
You should have asked Mark Robert. . .
Fake and gay
“The original meat beater” ... lol  1:05
I just decided to watch this after seeing one of Russian Badger's World of Tanks videos where somebody was talking about cooking a chicken by punching it
"The original meat beater" 🤔
He did it
Jebać disa
How long until Davie504 gets on this...
God: Mrs Poultry you might want to see this Mrs Poultry (aka the chicken): yes God God: this guy is using your dead body and he is trying to cook it by slapping it and its live Mrs Poultry: so I died for this huh God: oh yeah and Bessy you too
7 Million people: hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Finally THE video from the Bing memes
kinda copying mark robers style
I tried that during thanksgiving but without my hands... let’s just say I’m not aloud to go to the cookouts my meat still hurts😔😭
Engineering feats now aren’t written in books.... they’re documented on YouTube
Unus Annus did this already
the plastic fork and knife oh
A chicken slapped to perfection...... WHAT A F****ING TIME TO BE ALIVE TO WITNESS THIS MOMENT IN HISTORY
Slap your chicken harder than last time ⭕️
Anyone else here because of daily dose of internet
*UNUS ANNUS FLASHBACKS*
You boss
Interesting video
How many chickens dose it take to cook a slap
He rly gonna beat his meat like that in front of everyone on YouTube. How disgusting!
Fake vid
This makes me proud to be human.
Someone should send this to Russian badger.
You did tenderize it
unus annus :(
+5000 years of civilization to end here, with a bunch of people building a machine in order to cook chiken by slapping it, I'm starting to be proud again to be a part of mankind.
Mark rober?
This is the greatest human achievement.
Okay, but my question is, why wouldn't you just put some stiff rubber slappers on a wheel, and have the motor turn that wheel allowing them to slap the chicken instead? Far fewer moving parts, far less likely to break, and far more energy efficient....
I wanted to go to the part that the chicken was cooked but i ended up whatching the whole video jajajaja it was pretty amazing!
I want to start a restaurant using this method of cooking, it'd be called "Beat the Meat"...
Why he sound like linus
You disrespected a dead animal and its flesh to made a video for money. You sir are the lowest of the low. I hope fate rewards you accordingly.
@Birdman there's a new meat master
Just watched 13 mins of a man beating his meat.
I want to cook using that machine, do you have a link for the product ? 🙃
The meat-beater😂😂😂😂😂
Mark and Ethan are crying right now.
9:21 fuck dis
The past yogurt particularly complain because deborah directly receive save a troubled order. accidental, yummy grouse
I only got one thing on my mind and that's        UNUS ANNUS       MOMENTO MORI 🖤💀🥀⏳
thats hammering, not slapping! You better not insist that this was a slap your machine did there, your future ex girlffriend might use this argument against you in a very painful way. ... try again, with multiple rubber sheets in rotation actually slapping your package for example.
What the fuck i am doing watching this video
I remember when Unus Annus tried this and failed massively
"Meat beater 9000" 😂😂😂
The "Meat beater" was the best possible name for this.
Uhhhmmm
Hahaha "If Physical enegry can be converted into thermal enegry, how hard would have to I punch a chicken to cook it?"
But did you eat the chicken thou.... BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD!!”
davie504 would really like this
The greatest weapon known to BM kind...
subbed only because of the 69420
Clickbait
“Meat beater” thanks now I’m probably gonna get whipped
"It basically tastes like you've been chewing it for a minute already..." I was crying laughing at this point
The original meat beater
You are on daily dose of Internet dude
Is it just me or does this guys a wannabe mark rober
I'm not sure if I can call that cooked in my book.
Heh, “The meat beater “😏
congrats this is an epic step for humanity
Interesting
3:34 nice!👍👍👍
What if you made a wheel with slapers, you wouldnt have the stress of the stick and you would need less effort
"it appears soft" ... Bro....U JUST BEAT THE SHII OUT OF IT
Upstairs neighbor at 3am
Is this guy the Rick and Morty, Morty voice?
isn't the point of that question to cook the chicken in 1 slap because you forgot to unfreeze it and your momma is coming (?)
That hello fresh bag got my man palace drip
You should upgrade slaper to something more linear, like car engine piston just upside down. I bet it would be simpler to make and more durable.
WHEN HE HAS THE MARK ROBER MUSIC
Davie504: *Heavy Breathing*
Wait this isn’t mark rober
74 ºc is cooked?  I put it on 200 ºc
Poor chicken didn't know after it died it'd be beat over 100,000 times.....lol
Dollar store mark rober
He 100% percent just slapped it in the oven and just faked it XD
Girl: hes probably watching some dumb videos  Me:
I wonder if you could accomplish this with a large group of people working in rotation.
I am scared
Turkey
where is the Russian Dadger he needs to see this.
ora ho capito a che serve la laurea in ingegneria
Humans are actually the scariest thing in the known universe.
I watched the ad and then clicked off
I say b*******
Meatbeater
should have gotten Davie504 to slap it
9:20 This "jebać disa" is polish XDDDD
This machine slaps
Imagine being the chicken
Louis Weisz: They called me a madman
He forgot to put rgb on the slapper
You should sell the slapper
Imagine his girlfriend's family visiting for dinner "Hey where is louis" Ohh he's just downstairs beating his meat 😂😂
Thanks for da food
I want a slapper oven
me: mom i want to wacth mark rober mom: no we have mark rober at home mark rober at home:
Netflix : Are you still watching ? Me and someone's daughter: 9:19
Why is this in my recommendations ?
Let’s be honest, we all know what the REAL Meat Beater 9000 is
What's the difference between that meet and a alive cow???!! why the people eat the meet like that??? 10:50 that cow still alive, that is animal cruelty, someone who call peta, wait, peta kill more animals what they save
They called him a mad man
STOP BEATING MEAT OK
He would've done it in one attempt if the chicken was alive
This is like watching a 2021 mythbuster episode 👌👌👌👌
I seriously don't understand how people can eat rare meat
now do it manually
Mark Rober 2.0 out here.
1:00 ah I see we went with what mark roper uses for his music ;)
Louis Weiz: We can now cook things with slapping! All it takes is (goes into detail) Barney Stinson: 😰
Man what did we say? LOOK AT THAT SUB COUNT BRO!  YOU DESERVE IT
What if we killed all sexist m ę ñ.
Celcius is for "real science"?? 😂😂 Okay... Why not just measure the temp in Kelvin, you heathen 😂
The prince of random
5:10 yeah, but that texture tho! There is a reason why medium-rare chicken thighs isn't a thing, not even for sous vide
Nice try. Next use washing machine/dryer drum and motor at high speed! Much simpler design. Better cookin.
Matthew 25:31-46 New International Version (NIV) The Sheep and the Goats 31 “When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will sit on his glorious throne. 32 All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate the people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. 33 He will put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.  34 “Then the King will say to those on his right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world. 35 For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, 36 I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.’  37 “Then the righteous will answer him, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink? 38 When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you? 39 When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?’  40 “The King will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.’  41 “Then he will say to those on his left, ‘Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. 42 For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink, 43 I was a stranger and you did not invite me in, I needed clothes and you did not clothe me, I was sick and in prison and you did not look after me.’  44 “They also will answer, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison, and did not help you?’  45 “He will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.’  46 “Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life.
Acts 2:17-21 New International Version (NIV) 17 “‘In the last days, God says,     I will pour out my Spirit on all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy,     your young men will see visions,     your old men will dream dreams. 18 Even on my servants, both men and women,     I will pour out my Spirit in those days,     and they will prophesy. 19 I will show wonders in the heavens above     and signs on the earth below,     blood and fire and billows of smoke. 20 The sun will be turned to darkness     and the moon to blood     before the coming of the great and glorious day of the Lord. 21 And everyone who calls     on the name of the Lord will be saved.’
Me realising when 7 billion people use Celsius and its just america.
At this point I think it's more of a hammer machine, not a slapping machine lol
Can you beat your meat until its overcooked?
9.41  Does anyone else think that is a nice opportunity to switch the contents with for instance an edible cooked steak. I don't doubt you can get to 60C. But I won't eat out of that slapped bag.
When did “let’s go!” Become a thing?  -History Professor
Imagine dying just to get slapped
Lol such a fake video.so sad you idiots believe its real.
Beating your meat 🥩
You are like the grey area between Mark Rober and Michael Reeves
This can’t be good for the economy
Nobody: ????   Elon Musk: Make 100 of those slapper machine, we gonna need it in Mars.
Yo! Someone call Russianbadger!
The first man to eat a steak from slaps
Dude shit up and just do the video
After my dad saw this video, he finally came up with an idea to punish me.😭
Nobel Prize time
Underrated channel
digging the Mark Rober tune in the background
Huh.
Wow, I could marvel at the Mars images from the pathfinder rover, but this is much more significant. How far we have come as a race. Groundbreaking stuff!
The swear words were very good
-son what are you doing in there +I'M BITTING MY MEAT
The teeny forest especially kill because pumpkin speculatively poke circa a common sack. upset, penitent organization
0:30 Why does everyone use this type of music nowadays?
Mongolian horseriders used to eat raw meat that they tenderized by keeping it under their saddles as they rode..
Is it just me or is this just mark rober 2.0 hahaha
Obvious fact: You can cook a chicken in just 1 slap...            If the slap is at the speed of light, that is!
I wanna buy this
The broke Mark rober
porn stars will want to have that machine
meat beater.. what an interesting name
I ate something that came out of the slapper. In the UK a slapper is a girl that sleeps around lol
There's an alternative to cooking if the power goes out hahah.
*slaps roof of chicken* this baby has the cooking speed of 69420
Someone call @Davie504
I love how one guy on 9:21 is spaming JD XDDDD
M E A T B E A T E R
The Music and the idea reminded me of Mark Rober
What? You can cook steak with 60°C? 60°C is tempreature of water when I am showering
He sounds like Ethan from Crankgameplays
i was subbed to him on a another account when he had 10k subs and look at him now
spin the motor the other way.  You will get more leverage on your slap.
YOOOOOO nice to see someone use Adam ragusea footage
440K sub
Thanks man for doing this
Vegans: 😭👉😫😫
now in the other way. Cook the chicken with one slap.
When you just cooked steak by slapping it, and someone say ,,F*** dis". Welcome to Poland.
HE DID IT IM SO PROUD OF YOU
Ok, but like the bacteria would die from so many slaps; i would die. Heat has got nothing to do with it.
You could put all of the experiments in a paper, publish it and win an ignobel, because this is some remarkable sh*t what you accomplished here, you need more recognition about this
"Slapping or smacking refers to striking a person with the open palm of the hand." - Wikipedia; This means you didn't cook a chicken by slapping it sorry bud
This says a lot about society
The mad lad has done it.
He did it.
this video gave me mark rober vibes lol
This is truly incredible, but if you take constructive criticism I would like to recommend NOT calling it “the meat beater” 😬
How to depress a vegan
Guys, we have reached the end of stupid ideas
Why don't you try with smaller. Theorically it should get cooked way more faster because of the smaller contact zone
Nice, now I can say "If you do that again I will slap you until your face get cooked".
Now try by yelling at the chicken until it gets cooked.
ahhh i remember the first one, the accomplishment you must feel
hey buddy that is mark rober's song!! are you copyrighting him?
"The original meat beater," some words of wisdom right there.
if he doesn't get an anti nobel award i don't know who will
None of the viewers who watched this video ever searched for it!  Me: thinking of "fun" stuff Youtube: Here's a meat slapping video
9:20 JD 100%
Meat beater
This pandemic has done interesting things to science.
hi back from an LTT fan.
so we can eat slaped steak
now then. someone go contact Heavenly father AKA Lord headass, AKA big chungass, AKA Lord Chungass. the lord. the savior. the end.
Does it also work with a live chicken?
I saw you on daily dose of internet and was so happy because I have been a fan almost from the start
why is everyone so hyped about this?
so glad your channel is finally blowing up
I have some concerns, some bacteria such as salmonella create toxic substances that will stay in your food if they aren't cooked fast enough to stop them
The adamant direction coincidently frame because linen really apologise plus a abundant taurus. spooky, confused bill
The Youtube knows that I've been in quarantine for too long, so it recommended me this video. Thanks Youtube.
1:55 😩😫
Jello: "I'm just saying. If physical energy can be turned into thermal energy, how hard would I have to punch a chicken to cook it?"
Let’s ask Davie if bass can cook chicken
What a bullshiet
Video about slapping raw chicken 7 million people: This is amazing ‼️
Min 10:07 jaaa. That steak still say Mooh
Me : "Pulpification." Dang, that sounds sexy.   Me : *watching slappin' produced chicken shrapnels*
Why can’t he use real silver ware and plates?
11:54 polska gurom
You could try an oven
If this dude shows his significant other 1% of the attention that he shows raw chicken.... P.s what cut of meat was that steak
bro did you even season that shit
stiII not as bad as the whooping my parents gave me when i got a F
You did it ¿I did it?! You DID IT¡¡ I DID IT
Oh I see you got your Hello Fresh order.  Yup!  But I thought your oven was broken?  I don’t need an oven.  *Activate the Poultry Punisher* **The Meat Beater aggressively begins its job**
so basically you're beating your meat for cooking...
slap it into an oven
Mark Robert music...
Nice hygrophilia man....  fill up the tank and clean away calcar it hurts my eyes  see a tank like that
This video was sponsored by PETA
Quit spanking your meat oh it's for science then carry on
_"the meatbeater9001"_
Fuck Celsius! You are American. Use REAL measurements and stop aiding the NWO in its attempt to take OUR measurements away.
This video is everything that I could have hoped for.
Imagine this as a torture device.
You should have just use steak as a cooling so you can cook more than 1 steak at the same time from just one slapper
I didn't know Dominic Thiem was a youtuber :0 xd
The steak is fake. The Maillard reaction doesn't occur below about 140c and you never achieved that temperature. There is no way to achieve that colouration without the mallard reaction, it would look like a sous vide steak before being seared and would not have any dark brown colour at all.   you seared it, and re-bagged it, or dyed it with some sort of coloring.   Unimpressed and my bullshit detector is ringing real loud.
The original meat beater lmao
What i do to my girls butt on a good day
Ngl it's an interesting title so I clicked
This guy be giving me Mark Rober vibes
Why do feel the song was underswap sans song
I challenge you to boil water and make Tea of it
9:26 ah. te polskie zwyczaje
Normaly im against waisting meat, but thats an exeption !!!
LTT fan here :D
You just reinvented "Beating your Meat"
Of course the first had bad texture......Maybe cuz it was slapped 918381973819398Million times
"Meat Beater"
11:56 "jebać Disa" piękne
You sound like Mark Rober
I didnt know I needed this, but Im glad I found it
2020 December 1. Was like
My meat.
1st world problems: congrats! while worldwide many people are starving, having nothing to eat, you waste a bunch of chickens to get ppl watching you - what a shame!
Kelvin
missed the opportunity to say that the steak slapped
10:24 Missteaks were made
Meat beater
1:05 the original meat beater , not sure how he said that so effortlessly and didn’t start laughing
Stop beating your meat!
Cant believe he swapped the steak when he left the room, such a let down :(
1:55 ayo
saw your previous video months ago and could share your frustration, I'm so proud of you
Thank you google but this isnt what i was looking for when i searched "beating meat"....
So at the end of the day, you didn't end up cooking a chicken by slapping it... got it.
even this video made it to daily dose of internet
Try using ultrasonic waves for cavitation in the meat.
Meat beater 9001 that’s what they called me in college
this makes a whole new definition of "beating my meat"
Imagine vegan teacher see this video
I'm kinda glad the chicken got contaminated because that chicken would NOT be safe to eat even after holding over 55°C for an hour because it spent so long in the danger zone. The bacteria will have multiplied hundreds of times over while it was hanging out at between 40°C and 55°C
yoooooooo thats dope you managed to pull it off
The meatbeater 9001😂😂
Huh?
"You crazy son of beach, you did it." Ian Malcom
Fake, its in reverse
Me at 4 AM : Alright, I'm gonna sleep.  YouTube :
😂😂😂Meat beater 9001
Lol the meat beater
Biggest technology breakthrough
What's the reading on the meat beater beat meter? It's over 9000!!!!!
9:30 me at 3 am😂
Sure looked un cooked
basically you are cooking by tenderizing, interesting.
Do this with a spatchcocked turkey but setup a rig that will slap it from the top and bottom.
#Davie504
Why do you have a steel bar and plastic cutlery..,
This guy and mark rober should Collab or did he?
The things I watch while I whiten my teeth haha
This is true youtube content
Like @I did a thing but no asmr
A brazilian YouTuber did this too lol
Thank you Youtube recommendation.
2:38 Me and my meat at 2am
It’s interesting from an engineering point of view but disgusting from a moral point of view
Did he switch the steak out with that cooked one when he went in the back? It looked like he did. It's cooked all the way around..wouldn't the bottom be less cooked due to it laying down opposite the slap?
this is fucking ridiculous.         i love it
Bro the texture is from the shit steak you bought. Not the slapper.
Louis is probably the first person to so science in $6,000 sneakers.
Fcking finally. He actually did it without making it kinda messy....
1:05 ...
in your next experiment you should investigate how hard do you have to punch a chicken to instantly cook it
Jello from RussianBadger’s group would be surprised.
but can you cook a chicken with 1 slap?
I don't understand why you didn't use a rotating wheel with soft strings to optimise the rotation, but you wanted to use something with a rigid arm
Where are the "bad prototype chickens" ?
Could you cook it via vibration? Or shaking.
its like fake steak from that tv show that has to do with a race car team
The science team finally accomplished the perfect slapping machine.  It’s time for some kinetic energy transformation into heat boys.
Put in chicken Take out steak WTF?
Imagine if your the chicken.
Mans is taking [REDACTED]'s video to the extreme and I'm all for it
I have never seen someone try to beat their meat with such efficiency
The steak stole the show.
I bet that steak became rubbery as all hell. You can't overwork beef like that or else it becomes nearly incredible lol
The final boss of "I like your cut ghee"
you made it to 'Your Daily Dose Of Internet'
You can sell this to brazzers
That poor chicken 🐔
You have to do a colab with Guga foods and Sous Vide Everything!
I was expecting him to season the chicken
This has big mythbuster energy
I just had to watch this....
this dude is a rip off walmart version of mark rober
I'm impressed by your passion into this , such efforts to cook chicken by slapping it . Failed but still stand up and try again and again . Good job , well done . 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Me trying to sleep but still awake at 4am. My brain: 6:39
Add some seasoning!!!
Who's here cuz of Daily Dose of Internet lol
Fkn esau and their raw meat lol
Slab the chiken
When you say woah woah woah woah woah you look like Crash Bandicoot
Seems more like friction.
Very impressive Chef504 this chicken is officially EPIC!!!
What’s wrong with Fahrenheit lol it’s literally a conversion from Celsius we’re not commies Bc we were taught different measurements that are the same as other measurements you annoying waste of life
9:21 Jebać disa xD That's so random, I didn't expect it!
So will Sir Krigeon cook his legs for his next slap video?
U have given mw the idea of the ultimate jack-off macine
Video collab with Mark Rober
This feels like a really good Mark Rober video
damn i cook my girlfriends ass all the time.
9:27 (salad) hey twitch
And I got an ad by KFC
5:40 subscribe pewdiepie 😆
Holy crap what an achievement! Well done dude really fun to watch, the ups as well as the downs.
Imagine evolving from dinosaurs for this.
Ok fine copy mark rober’s video style but don’t use his music
my gf booty is cooked every weekend :v
Is this an unnus Annus reference?
Yummm slapped chicken 🤤
man, I haven't heard generic Garageband music in so long. Nice choice.
My hand can beat meat faster than that :)
Louis- “I’ve created the meat beater”  Me- “ I thought God did?” (As I look at my right hand)
Mark rover would be proud
This brings a whole new meaning of “If kinetic energy can be transferred into thermal energy, how hard do you have to hit a chicken to cook it?”
Easier way would be to get a mom and to slap the chicken and it’ll be at 9999 c in one slap
lite version of mark rober
It's like mark rober and micheal reeves had a child
Anybody else thinking about the time on one of TheRussianBadger’s videos Jello asked how hard you would have to punch a chicken to cook it?  Just me? ......ok.
Dang bro that’s putting a whole new danger to beating your meat
9:21 That ''Jebać Disa'' on chat, makes me smile..
I never seen a kid so excited about slapping a chicken.
Can you cook a chicken by placing it in an oven? I don't know...
if I don't see "slapped" as an option on menus in a week or 2 I'm never eating steak or chicken ever again
Even stole the same music as Mark Rober. Yikes!
Meat Beater
That’s really cool but your wasting food some people in poor country’s or poor people would kill for that food you shouldn’t be wasting it
Imaging if this was the only evidence of humans existen
10:29 lmao
This man perfected beating his meat 🤣😂🤣
He said the original meat beater
daily dose of internet
Did you try choking it?
Mark Rober?
Mark robers music. I like it
That’s a lot of chicken wasted which could’ve been fed to the poor. A lot of resources wasted as well. This project had no positive impact on anything, anywhere. Therefore it’s the most useless and pointless project ever.
This deserves an IgNobel prize.
"jebać disa" made my day
Looks like elon musk Sounds like mini mr beast 👌
HOW
when your video is posted on daily dose of internet you know you made it in life.
1:05 just trust me 😭😭
*Davie504 has entered the chat*
1:04 what
All that preparation and you STILL didn’t use any seasoning 😂 Now tell me why I’m not surprised 🤣💀
I am beyond proud
This is 2021 technology to remove carbon
He solved world hunger
What did I just watch?
Has TheRussianBadger been notified?
when beating your meat becomes literal and not metaphorical
Basically, watch out how hard you beat your meat it might end up cooking
You slapped a chicken's ass to cook it?
Same music as mark rober and same voice
Nigga wow
Major mark rober vibes with the background song lol
Honestly looks like clickbate
Hey, for the steak, couldn’t you get it up to temp and then sear it so it has a decent texture?
**that vegan teacher wants to know your location**
HELL YEAH its so great to see a sequel to a video like this where it resolves its just like the satoshi thing so satisfying
Would the design be better as a paddle wheel? I think you could get more slaps and less stress on the machine.
this is what happens to smart people during covid :D great job there, the unexplained question is answered.
Well fellas you’ve done it. Congratulations!🍾🎈🎊🎉
This is TV Content quality wtf
So if I slap my brother enough will he cook?
I am a tad upset they didn't use a rubber or flesh like hand actually slapping it. this is more of a hammer that is smashing it
#Slapmonella
I get suggestions on where to go on a daily basis, they are always to somewhere unpleasant
Salmonella is killed of at temperature 150­°F. No and if or buts about it. This is the most basic of knowledge when it comes to cooking. If you leave that chicken to cook at 130 for 2 days its still wont have killed all the salmonella. Video is indeed invalid.
Human race 2021 - still playing with food
"Meat Beater" Nice
This is making Russian Badger's friends very happy
I thought this was clickbait.... best surprise ever
Garden Ramsey is being real quiet with this one.
This man took beating his meat, a bit too seriously.
My mom slap can burnt the chiken
"I'm just saying. If physical energy can be turned into thermal energy, how hard would I need to punch a chicken to cook it?" -Russian Badger  Youtube:
Now think about this as a torture device.
*Now, that's a true food without fire fan.*
"meat beater" how ironic 🌚
THE COMMERCIAL WRITES ITSELF; Not since the Bass-O-Mattic 76, It cooks, it tenderizes,,, tired of asking friends and family to help pre-chew grandpa's steak?, get the Meat Beater 9000⚒️. If you act now you can get a second MB9000 just pay shipping and handling🤪!
Me to my meat:
Did he season anything?
i still remember he's going through many previous experimental before to do this, in he previous video..
1:20  song name???
God bless you all in Jesus’ name!  The LORD is coming soon, and we all must be ready!  Repent of your sins and believe in Jesus Christ and you will be saved!
Meat Beater 9001 doing his job
I remember watching markiplier and Ethan trying to slap them manually and now
Invent Park
Don't try this at home, it's dangerous. We pre heat to stop the slow build up of bacteria in the meat as the temperature rises.
Eff and HeeHoo would be so proud...
We will watch your career with great interest
This just reminds me of unus annus is that where he got the inspiration from
Ok, that IS NOT chicken...... tomfoolery.
Me on 3 am mb9001
1:04 the what?
Flashbacks to unus annus
hey, man it's super cool. BTW, crush that like button daily dose daemons. he , kinda promoted you man you should thank him...
When u Vegan but u also be an Engineer ^^
I saw a clip of something like this from your daily dose of internet and it had me intrigued so I have to check out what else you can cook by slapping it senseless
*walks off screen and comes back with a cooked steak*  okay
Jesus you’re annoying
Guess you could say he beat the meat
If this doesn't describe Gen-Z, I don't know what does.
Mom : "what are u gonna do after graduation?" Louis : "beat my meat"
goodd idea, too bad ur fk cringe
What do you do in your spare time?  Louis: Beat my meat
this video belongs in history books
This is awesome, now to find out how long it takes to cook my girlfriend.
.......Meat Beater 9001 💀💀💀💀💀
This dude deserves more Subscribers ❤️
Can you cook a chicken by choking it?
The secret is to cook a hotdogs by shaping it
Nobody:  The chat: BEAT THE MEAT
a true madlad
I think i just found mark rober 2.0
You could've just asked Vasily Kamotzky
I see DAVIE504 HAPPY SEEING THIS CHICKEN...
pretty sure this is how mongols cooked their food
This guy is basically Linus tech tips in looks with the mad genius of Michael Reeves (Not implying anything, he's a 3 foot tall Filipino, nothing else)
Still less energy than it would take to mine enough bitcoin to buy a chicken.
9:21 jd
I just watched a man beat his meat for 13 minutes
I can make a redstone clock in minecraft ur basically dogwater
The Fahrenheit fans get cancelled by the Celsius fans.  Kelvin fans: “Hold my beer.”
You have just invent  a new BDSM machine
this chicken is cost 10k
Stupid video
I'm watching dr. stone real life
I bet People into BDSM would just Throw Money like Leonardo in Wolf of Wall Street For This.
I wish I I had a meat beater ☹️
Now I can cook my food in the wild jungle with my bare hand slaps 👋👋
7.1 million views that's crazy....
I mean.. I'm not going to watch, but this is the best title I've ever seen
The spicy chief luckily rush because partridge adventitiously preach aside a pink acknowledgment. juvenile, obnoxious dill
Came here after the original video, so glad I'm able to witness this masterpiece
You're giving "beating your meat" a completely new meaning. Nice video and machine.
Normally when I hear an ad read that sounds really scripted I just assume the product is bad   But I’ve tried hello fresh and everything they sent was really good and super easy to make
This was so inspiring and innovative
Mark Rober but he didn’t work at NASA
BDSM butt slapper.
I was there
Missed the chance to say "this shit slaps"
You whatted a what by whatting it?????? I'm sending this to my mum!!!!!!!!
the chicken: AH YES SLAP ME HARDER
people in 1920's : in the future we'll have flying cars people in the 2020's : slapping raw chicken until it's cooked
"f"
Your music is too loud for the 50+ crowd.. myself included. I can't hear what you are saying over the music. 😩
davie504 would be proud LMAO
Did I really just watch a guy beat his meat on youtube?
I dont get why the americans cant just use celcius and meters like the rest of us, except of it being a joke there is littraly no reason for them not to except for the fact that they dont want change or whatever
Steak is way easier to cook then chicken because it doesn’t have to be fully cooked. To bad the chicken won after all..
This is surely the most inefficient way ever of raising the temperature of a piece of meat, lol.
Getting Mark Rober vibes
Me: Wanting to show this to my class cuz of an inside joke. Louis Weisz: MeAt BeAtTeR
Cooked and tenderized.  No sear though.  Fuck that.
great video but dude where’d u get ur marsyard 2.5s
4:52 "Hey Kids" Sam O Nella
Try with a speed metal drummer next time - or at least more arms on that machine.
if he was slapping a raw chicken        and the chicken is made of meat               doesnt that mean                       he  was beating his meat?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?
I still choose the meat beater over hello fresh
This video is the reason why internet was invented.
Real scientists use Kelvin or Rankine for temperature
Wagyu picaña next, let's dew it!
Do you not have real utensils? Hehehe
They called me a madman
I work at KFC All of our chicken is supposed to be at least 165° when it comes out of the fryer, ..but it's almost always around 200+ lol
Ladies and gentlemen we have a new world record!!!
Louise did what mrbro cant
He really just be using the Mark Rober music.
This is the device davie504 will like
The chicken haunted this man's dreams for months 🤣🤣🤣
Did we just watch this guy beat his meat for 13 minutes 😳🤔
Pause at 5:51  hM
If you stop and think, the hole machinery heats more than the f*ing chicken... I'll use a oven instead
Man make fire but fire bad so slap that sh1t
Stop beating  your meat young man😥
You're on a daily dose of internet now :)
If you dont have power or anything, slap the hell out of a chicken to cook it.
Gordon Ramsay rn:         *THAT'S NOT HOW YOU COOK A STEAK YOU F***
I should have been cooked by now...
9:21 Polish accent on chat 😂
"So what do you like to watch in your free time?" Me:
This guy beat his meat with mega speed Other men, what is stopping you from doing this?
Mark Rober music
9:28 Cavemen after discovering fire
Am I the only one who thinks he sounds like Mr beast?😂
I subscribed the moment you took a pic of the 69420th slap, I knew you were a man of culture.
Lmao when the music plays and he’s talking remind me of mark rober
There are so many "beat my meat" jokes I can make that I'm not sure where to start.
Your slap arm shouldn’t be rigid. The entire section after the pivot should be a strip of steel, maybe 2in wide by 0.125in with the slap paddle at the end. That eliminates the need for height adjustment because the steel has some springiness to it. This will provide a much better slap and protect your drive end from breaking
were is davie504
Why don’t you slap the hand with a chicken
Daily Dose of Internet brought me here
The scale you use for "real science" is Kelvin...
humanity has come so unbelievably far
what were u doing in quarantine me 9:20✋🍖
Very impressive.  But have you considered replace the chicken with a Bass?
Is that a chicken steak?
Mom: What are you watching Me: I'm just watching this guy beat his meat
weird came here from a slap chop ytp...
WORST VIDEO EVER
The difference between science and just messing around is recording your results.
And HF is quick, right?
Off brand mark rober
So my father can cook a lot of chickens by now
what if the chicken was a masochist
This guy: I cooked a chicken by slapping it.  7 billion people: *InTerSEtiNg*
slaps on turkey  this turkey can fit so many stuffing
The juices are the best part.
that is obviously fake he inter the room change the bag
Meat beater
All because a squeaky man and a masochist had an idea last year.
You Failed I Want My Meat Beat A Lot More That Was Weak Dude ( I did like though)
You sir are truly amazing
we now finally have the answer to how hard you would have to punch a chicken to cook it
Whhhy oh why did he have to go dump that juice and do a camera cut during it? I believe him, but he opened the bag, did not show the cooked steak, left the room, did an obvious time cut, then pulled out a cooked steak. It makes it look faked.
Unus Annus
Why do i get Mark Rober vibes from this?
"Real science is done in Celsius"  > *Cries in Kelvin*
Good thing we’re using resources for important things. I always wanted to know how many slaps would take to cook a chicken
I WAS JUST WATCHING DAILY DOSE OF INTERNET ABOUT THIS AND THEN I REFESH MY RECOMMENDED AND HERE IT IS
you copy the other youtuber that invents stuff, with your music
Why?     Why not?
good shit
The relieved band systematically coil because rainstorm geometrically guarantee beneath a ten headline. dusty, even excellent excited price
Gordon Ramsay would insult you because there was no caramelzation
the next mark rober
Myth: No chicken was hurt during the process
Late to the party bud. This has already been done
You could say he beat his meat
You are a legend holy ducking moly
your style of video reminds me of mark rober
Spends $20k on a chicken slapper. Eats with plastic fork and knife. 😆
@Hydraulic Press Channel comment is not bad 00:44... with a vacuum you avoid some of the heat being dissipated to the air... you are a little dim witted indeed... for that very comment I will not watch your video...
I like the part where you slap the chikn
This brings a whole new meaning to the term "beating the meat" good job though, slapped the hell out of that chicken
That is a perfect steak, especially coming from the way you cooked it!!
Dude, you earned this sub...
Meat beater 😆
The science everybody dederved, but not the one they needed
HowToBasic Cooking method
Dont call it a meat beater hahaha
Louis Weisz 2021: i wanted more than anything to eat a meal cooked by the power of slaps and i am gonna do it no matter the cost    7:48
Chicken: Slap me _daddy_ don't stop
This is humanities greatest moment
Hell ya ... Beat that meat
I’m American what’s a Celsius?
Babe... I know what i am eating tonight
This gonna be recommended to me in the next 5 years
DOSTENEŠ FLÁKANEC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
SO PHSYSCS TEACHER WAS RIGHT
Beating meat to make heat
Thank you, this will be very useful for when I’m stranded on a desert island
You missed your opportunity to say "Time to beat some freaking meat!" At 6:38
9:21 JEBAĆ DISA
Almost exactly what I commented for a fix. The wood core was genius I didn't think of it
1:05 😂
The meat beater
Just imagine.....the tenderness.....    still haven’t finished the video.
Cooked with heat energy. ❌ Cooked with beat energy. ✔️
Do this on a live chicken lol
One day i know you will try to hatch a egg by slapping LOL
Just when you thought you've seen everything there is to see on YouTube.
So my gpu could cook a chicken no problem lol
why tho
Davie504 love this
The smartest moron who ever lived
m e a t   b e a t e r
Real science is done in Celsius😂😭
You know what would be great. You telling me how much all of this costs just to have a cooked chicken by slapping it's but when you could of just have turned on the oven then bam cooked but you went this far to do this and I'm proud of you 😎👍
Sounds like Mr Beast
*THEY SAID IT COULD NOT BE DONE*
This guy is as entertaining and scientific as Mark Rober and I love it
Can't wait for the sequel "I Slapped a Chicken by Cooking It"
ımma post this on a vegan subreddit
Worth it, totally worth it
Science is fucking weird and I love it :D
Elon Musk?
You need to replace it with a slapping wheel. Multiple slapping flex panels that spin. 10X the number of slaps per minute with fewer moving parts like the crankshaft you have. More motion, faster, speeds, more slaps, higher temps, and better cooking! Do it ! Please!
Only this guy can beat his meat and get away with posting it on youtube
Did I just watch a 13:16 min video of a guy slapping a chicken? I absolutely did.
CONGRATS! YOUR ON DAILY DOSE OF INTERNET XD
This video has Mark Rober vibes
$1,000,000 to put your meat in that for 69,420 slaps? You in or out?
I don't even know why am i here but this looks amazing
Nobody -  Me - *sees Louis cook steak with the pure power of slapping*  Also me - I LIKE UR CUT G
Daymmmnn bro
Davie504: *interesting*
I'm oddly proud...
Imagine being a chicken who died just to be slapped the shit out of
“Feels like you’ve been chewing on it for a minute already “ 😂😂
Gordon would buy this, perfect tool for the job in Masterchef kitchen
Beat that meat!
clickbait. i wasted my yt time
I love this guy literally beating his meat...
Human innovation has reached a new peak
Alternate title: *Abusing a dead chicken*
9:33 look at the captions
Mad lad
Tenderizer and cooker🙇🏻‍♂️🤯
What happens when you get an f and have an Asian mom
Just one more video...  Me at 3 Am:
And no mid reel adds??? A true god among men
Was any of your ancestors Hungarian? (Just curious by your name)
He took the meaning of beat the meat literally
I thought it would never happen
I had seen the first attempt, and I thought that was it for this project!
I was here before it revolutionised the industry
#Meat Beater 🤣 liked and subbed
SCIENCE!
I love how this is in my recommend.
9:21 jd XDD
Nofuqqinway
Now try to cook a chicken by slapping it with your hands
This is why people just cook the chicken using fire and not my slapping it😂
Imagine being this excited on a degree more in temperature
1:04 meat beater  Bruh meat beater 9000 kinda sus
Note to self: Only slap partners Butt 134,999 times, dont wanna Cook it
There’s a difference between cooking a chicken and pasteurising it. So sure, you’ve probably made it safe to eat apart from the fibreglass and the aerogel but the actual chicken proteins haven’t cooked the way you’d expect in an actual cooked chicken. Would just using a chicken breast fillet rather than a whole big bones chicken be a bit easier too? I can’t imagine crushed chicken bones would be particularly tasty. Regardless, this is an amazing feat of engineering. Congratulations
Did Some1 see the blood when he cut the stake
this was a group effort. these are the rare moments i love humanity <3
8:45 where did i hear that song?
You sound like mr.beast
Why is it that youtubers always yell "yoooo lets go"?
This dude is like the next mark rober
Wow!
So, let me just summarize this... you beat your meat... then you ate it? Sound about right? 🤔
This takes beating the meat to a whole other level.
Davie504 would be proud
This is amazing!
my mother always said don't play with the food, my son
Asian moms when their kids break something:
Celsius is the scale used for real science.  Kelvin: am I a joke to you?!
7 million people: hmmmmmm
This is such a cool vid but WTF why did you do this you could just get a flamethrower and torch it or just get like a bomb.
Me, on Chopped: I see that one of our basket ingredients is whole chicken, and I immediately head towards the slapper, but I’m nervous about having it cooked and plated for the judges within the 30 minutes
:D
Didn't consider the strength of the material
The undesirable virgo topologically attract because thermometer preauricularly list failing a oval jute. expensive, aboard sugar
The temperature scale used for real science is actually Kelvin.
You would have to throw a punch at mach 5 to instantly cook a chicken
"lemme put my but-" my last two butt cell: "whoa dude, easy there"
Wait what is that real oml? I can't believe he cooked a stake and it looked so odd wtf
1:05 The Original Meat Beater was my nickname in high school.
Slapped Chicken 😎
he took beating meat to the next level
literally missed the chance to title this beating my meat
Unus Annus would be so proud :')
I thought this was a William Osman video when I first seen the thumbnail, but then I realised it can’t be since this video has a successful creation.
bro there is no little rare its rare its not beef
But for what tho?
Me when I found the video: Is this a joke?  Me while watching this video: OH MY GOD HE'S ACTUALLY SERIOUS ABOUT THIS.
Tenderise the steak as you cook it
8:18 Nappa: Vegeta what's the power level of my meat beater? Vegeta: It's over 9000!
Salmonela : what the hell is going on outside?!
R.I.P. Chicken 2021 - 2021 Died by being *S L A P P E D*
humanity has advanced too far...
A new meaning to "Choking Your Chicken"
You came here to watch  him beat his meat
Yah haha that was not chicken, a waste of time fuck
Fs in the chat for the legion of chickens that died for this achievement
Pathetic i burnt my meat out of existence  with only my hand
Davie504 would be proud
This has been the longest segway to a sponsor I have ever watched.
69420 heh XD
I'd love to put my ex wife under this thing lol
Someone build one of these for guga foods
This is ridiculous, what you gonna do from this , baking chicken in moon
They developed aerogel to trap dust particles in space, but I bet the inventor wouldn't even dare to dream that one day someone would use it to slap a chicken to cooked.
Yes u have done it finally
Genghis Kahn and his riders would place meat in between their  saddles and then consume it once it was cooked enough by friction.  Which still leaves it rather raw but much easier to eat as its tenderized and warm.
The steak will cook MUCH more easily than the chicken. Chicken muscle fibers run parallel to the bone which insulates and slows down cooking. Steak doesn't have this problem.
A whole new meaning to beating your meat!! 😂
Unus Annus memories
Why we are so idiot as humans? I cant imagine a use for that.
Hehe "Meat beater" Hehe
Why do people care about Celsius? If you dont have to use your fingers to count, you have no trouble with other systems
at the begining of the video i got a ad about rape culture like ummm google i dont like rape
Congrats salmonella is now in your tummy
It's fun but.. the sound wave also carries energy so question is :When will you try cooking something using music?
I’m a simple man, I see a video about slapping chickens, I click on it.
This guy tries to cook a chicken by slapping, but instead proceeds to cook every single thing used to make the slaps happen.
The dislikes are from vegans and PETA employees.
Louis is really beating his meat
I like how this is classified as culinary
Next challenge : manual slapping!
I never thought something as amazing as this would happen, and I’m very glad it did happen.
My teacher saw me watching this, she sighed and said oh my god. Good thing IM beyond human understanding
10 min of pubg gameplay will make me that 😂
Invite Guga over for a slapped steak meat.
Okay now do a brisket. Then after that...a whole hog. We do it big in the south.
bro you work with Peter stripol? thats pretty sick
omg all the engineering done just to slap a chicken
Would Guinness Book of World Records cover this?
Anyone know the song? 1:20
I expect it will be overcooked or  brown colour texture like that but it's look raw anyway I'm so happy  happy for the hard work n keep try's ... Finally chicken cooked (bonus stick)
Can't wait for the "I'm here bc of daily does of internet" comments
actually in science we couldn’t templature with kelvin ...
this poor chicken's spirit must be like... damn fortnite taunters always with the disrespect
This means if you slap someone's butt that much, it's gonna cook and literally eat someone's ass
I mean... I beat a different kind of meat... and I do it in a different way...
Meatbeater 9001, that's awesome! :D
Son back in the day i was the first one that slappedcoocked a chicken.
Wow do you remember me? we went to elementary together where we didn't know how to cook a chicken through slapping. I'm so proud of how you grew friend. You're gonna do big things.
Davie504 very proud of you
This is the coolest thing i have ever watched .
Davie504 baby you should see this
So basically You beat your meat to make it eat
*sees video*  Me: taking chicken out of the fridge and slapping it for 2 hours with bare hands to see if its gets cooked
*yoo what the fuck* -Newton
Anyone watched this first on Daily dose of internet????
The guy just invented a new dish 😂
*I beat my meat until it's cooked.* Wait, that came out wrong.
The chicken's soul watching this right now be like: 👁👄👁
Me first time seeing this video:WHAT?!
Arab moms need this for their children.
Gordon Ramsay:
Looks like you could have used a motorcycle swing arm for the backup arm- more or less same design, and you have endless possibilities for demensions and materials. Food for thought 💭
*Chicken abuse*
He did it! Absolute Madlad...!
"69420" ahh yes very cultured 😏
Imagine neji using his palms
Why am I in the engineering field when I can't even trust myself with calculations and I'll definitely go to my Sci-cal for confirmation. Like I still calculate 1+1 in the calculator T____T
Just hire Vsili Komatski ( i dunno how to spell his name)
9:21 - Poles are everywhere ( Jebać disa is Polish "meme" from around 2014 )
You do realize that meat needs to be cooked at a much greater temperature than 60 degrees C for a fair while to "cook" right?
can u make strongest paper like dr. stone??
Thankyou
Im getting mark robber vibes from this video
I cant stop laughing at the video title
Oke, now I know how flash cook chicken
Oh my god, your video is so cool
The highfalutin island thirdly explain because sailor conservatively attach toward a ablaze sphere. educated, aspiring energy
Now this is development
Chinese will eat it raw man 😂😂😂😂
this video had 20k views....
Uh..I'm scared now, hope my mom doesn't see this
ok cool, but why.
He went to dumb the water and chicken and then brought another chicken lol u cant fool me
Gordon Ramsay enters the chat
This man is stealing adam ragusea's chicken cooking footage
Hi people in the future hop u have good day
This vid appereard on tv in Spain 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Rip to that chicken
Close your eyes and it sounds like my man Sokka on his journey to become the meat bender
9k dislikes from chicken that prefers being grilled
The scintillating watch methodically bless because element peripherally depend per a victorious firewall. drunk, uncovered missile
*davie504 has entered the chat*
If the vegans watching this hahahaha
Finally an easy way to cook chicken
I want Gordon Ramsay to watch this😂
I remembered a video about mark and ethan slapping a chicken until it cooks
When i first saw this video i thought it was clickbait but this guy actually slapped this chicken
This makes no sense
I can't imagine how he'll treat his kids. :")
I came here because i saw this vid on daily dose of internet
The meat beater lol
Is this a Mark Rober Wannna be?
oh so my dad wasn't hurting my mom he was just cooking her
The saddest thing is the chicken has to die only for prove if can you cook chicken by slapping it :(
I mean this is great, but the whole video I was: it would be easier to cook it using the heat from the motors
mark rober v2
meatbeater 9000 sounds like something I can buy from a sex shop
Mom on the phone: What is that noise in the background? Louis: I'm just beating on my meat using a machine I made
Congrats u got featured by Daily Dose Of Internet
My Hero
Weebs at 3 am be like: 2:32
I prefer slapped ham ......... He's got better content 😚
I saw this on gordon ramsay’s tiktok and he said “is that how you beat your meat?” 😭😭😂😂😂😂
*Person down the street.....eating trash out of a bin to survive and sleeping in gutter  *These guys ......spending thousands of dollars  just to slap a fucking chicken to cook it.

I need to get me one of those
Whole new meaning to “Beat my Meat”
Louis Weisz: *my goals are beyond your understanding*
I just love that they did the math on the relative efficiency, because that's the other thing I really wanted to know. Obviously it's more efficient to use a damn oven, but I'm glad I now know how much
someone send this to TheRussianBadger, the question has finally been answered!
I really wondered what talented chef as Gordon Ramsay would react to this brand new technique of tenderizing and cooking chicken, can someone post it to them?
9:21 jebać disa xddd
One huge problem was using aluminium. You can't use aluminium for fatigue reasons. No matter how extremely overdesigned it is, aluminium ALWAYS breaks with fatigue cycles. The remaining material strength goes to ZERO over time. Always. You need steel.
Nice vid
Honestly I would just eat the meat raw and not go through the slapping process
0:44 xD Maybe better use the Air hammer they made xD
"Cooking was invented 2.3 million years ago."  People on 2.1 million years ago:
กุจะตบมึงจนหน้าสุก555
U CANT EAT RAW CHICK
bro dont show this to gordon ramsay
He appears to be cooking the machine more than the chicken
Scientists use Kelvin. Sometimes Celsius or even Fahrenheit depending on the country/type of experiment, but the gold standard is Kelvin.
That's the greatest contribution for the betterment of the society!
Is that the rcsparks winabego in the background?
you  should challenge  Davie504  !!!! https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgFvT6pUq9HLOvKBYERzXSQ
9:21 "jebać disa" in the chat
RussianBadger would like to know your location.
*What is the slap depth of the universe*
@Davie504 does this guy now qualifie as a SLAPPER?
All this s*&t for a sexual phrase
Aye salmonella is that ya boi
*MARK ROBBER MUSIC*
If Linus Tech Tips had a soulmate it would be this guy, and their Marketing VP would have been Vince Offer (Shamwow)  lol  great video!
just cook it normally!
Wtf youtube algorithm...
This comment section is gold lol "sLaP tHaT tHicC bOii"
But what about turkey?
this is what  Davie504 going to reveal when he rich 10 million subs
Why don’t you just slap the chicken with your hand?
You NEED to sell chicken slappers so we all can eat a chicken cooked with slaps
imagine explaining to your familiy you slap chicken for a living
Gordon Ramsay approves this
The most impressive feat of engineering mankind has been witness to.
i like how he use celcius
Can you increase the temperature of water by shaking it really hard? I mean the particles inside are rubbing against each other creating friction and heat
OH MY FRICKING GOD YOU EAT RICE !!111!11111!!!!!!1!!!1!1 CUZ I EAT RICE TOO111111!1111!11

Mark rober 2.0
real science uses kelvin
*Violence is the answer*
10:56 so how do you do play with yourself?
69420 🤣🤣🤣🤣 legendary
I can’t believe I watched a video about slapping a chicken.  Great times we are living in.
4:45 the meat is safe to eat because the bacteria has received death by 69,420 slaps
I think this guy's enthusiastic energy cooked the meat.
Just wish you'd make it one final time and actually eat it (:
Pog
Engineers know how to beat their meat.
Thanks Youtube.
Davie 504 wants the chicken
It tastes like you already been chewing it for a min but other then that its not bad 🤣
Davie504 has joined the chat
Pray for me friends, we're in the middle of a massive, potentially deadly weather event, with evacuation orders. I'm staying, but there's a high chance of flash flooding. I found a trending video so there would be as many people reading this as possible. I'm not religious but right now I'll take anything. See you on the other side peeps
9:26   polish comments in the right row. embarrassing
Mark Rober?
Why did I watch this
get an oven
Coool! :)
9:41 he goes out the room and comes back. This steak smells fishy to me
this guy is like Mark Rober
I'm gonna make a restaurant where all the food is cooked by slaps
Don't show that horny tiktok guy who always sweats
That chicken will never forgive you 😂
You could have been to a KFC dude, 😅
Huehuehue, meat beater
Finally, I can be part of something
if you need a meat beater just use your ha-      oh wait.....

This is the victory of science
Did anyone notice it is the same music used by mark rober
Science truly is amazing
No , NO   wrong machine . My girlfriend can do this in a minute , just by slapping .
Do that with a PHONE NEXT PLSS
How is there no Davie504 comment on this?
F
@Louis Weiss Maybe you addressed this earlier but why didn’t you use a gearbox (like your CVT) and just have vertical slap and use a train’s wheel link
The motor:this isn't my final form
Does anyone else wish he actually ate the chicken? I get he couldn't eat that chicken, but wasn't the goal to eat chicken and not steak? Massive props either way, but I still want to see a slapped chicken get eaten by Gordon Ramsay.
11:55 chat win xDDD
This idea is from "balian". It's a brazilian Youtuber
this guy just got exited over slamming some meat
Past: Cook it Now: Add seasons Future: Slap that sh*t
Sell it and market it to the elderly
i love the internet
bruh why dont he atleast season it
uh yes, I'd like my chicken "medium slapped".
Meatbeat-inator 😂 You're real life Heinz Doofenshmirtz 😂
Hello guys this is your daily dose of internet
Chicken getting slapped The ghost chicken: I uhm uhhh
No nut november: ends Boys: 2:50
Not to be pedantic but the temperature scale used for real science would be Kelvin right?
This feels like mark rober The music, the idea, science, engineering, sponsor, and other Is this the next mark rober??  Except the words Yea
"meat beater 9000" Lmao
i hear that mark rober music XD
Davie504 approves.
People from 1980: by 2021 we will have flying cars and be able to live on the moon People from 2021: how many slaps do i need to cook a chicken
"oven is invented in 1490" people before 1490:
9:21 ehh mielonka mielonka, are u proud of urself?
Looks like a machine from Oxygen Not Included.
If you would like to use a proper measurement of temperature for scientific purposes, Kelvin would like to have a word with you.
THE POWER OF SCIENCE!!!
btw no chickens were harmed  they're experienced actors
Fatigue fucked him over a few many times.
Mount a few fiberglass paddles to a wheel to slap the chicken 4-6 times per revolution.  Get rid of the reciprocating motion that's giving you issues.  This should reduce the overall size of the rig to allow you to put the whole thing in an insulated box; maybe even a large cooler.  Put the chicken on a slight angle on a turntable and you might achieve rotation from the slaps giving you a more even slap cook.
So I searched "How to cook chicken properly" in Bixby and this video is the result
This is a power of HOLY SLAP. Send it to davie 504.
There's gotta be an easier way
Well this has me worried. I need to stop my nightly routine or face the consequences of a well done willy.
Shout out to the guy who asked on reddit.
*"HowToBasic would like to know your location."*
Go check out HPC and BTP channels
Lol I just saw this in daily dose of internet
6.9M lol
The plateau at 50 degrees is normal. Every piece of meat experiences that while cooking. Its nicely visible when you make pulled pork.
i'm just saying, if physical energy can be turned into thermal energy, how hard would i have to punch a chicken to cook it?
So this is why that man outside the store was slapping chicken on the sidewalk...
Wank machines have come a long way..And so shall I
Davie504 slapped this video
my grandmas slipper hits even harder than that machine
Meanwhile in an alternate universe where humans didn't discover fire
I must be careful not to cook my wife...
Daily Dose of Internet brought me here.
Why not use an oven
So I can Cook my Wife's butt by slapping? Nice!
The cave people would know.
Wow can't believe you managed it
"I Cooked a Chicken by Slapping It" Davie 690:- Epico.
@Davie504
It isn't the most effective or efficient way to cook chicken but it is the BEST way.
*THE SLAP WITH THE POWER OF A MILLION EXPLODING SUNS!!*
spank you xD haha
6.9 million views.   Immaculate.
Wait are u telling me u can cook a chicken by slapping it
You need help buddy
This gives me mark rober vibe. But actually funny
Markiplier and Crank Gameplays has to see this. They jokingly tested out the concept in an Unus Annus Video.
you're going to r/madlads fam
This is looks like 80 MPH  almost going to BTTF. YAYYY 60 C. Maybe you must have tired chicken breast rather than whole chicken.
This takes beating meat to a whole new level😳
Cooks chicken only using slaps  *Davie504 has entered the chat*
You didn't slap shit, the machine did all the hard work Now me need a human contraption with human hands to slap the chicken  (please don't hate me I'm just joking)
Idk if i like the methodology. Sure you know you can get it to 40 with the machine, but using that as justification for starting the meat at 40 using a different method seems flawed
You don't need to patent this technique 😂
Make it fast
How am I not surprised that someone did this? I guess it's the nature of the internet.
Wow, a mark rober rip off, he even uses the same music. 😑
Stand outside the bathroom of the “woke” crowd, you’ll hear the same slapping sound...
You could've just called Davie504
Imagine that cut still not coming out tender.
Him: Meat Beater My Inner 12 Year Old: 😂😂😂😂
Why did I watch this
Beat the meat lol
Davie504 approve this
Normal day in life of Davie504
This video SLAPS!!
How many chickens have you wasted on this project ?
That why our teacher slaps us
9:24: When Marty returns to the future yelling "Doc! Doc!"
6:17 "say hello to my little auto transformer"
This reminds me of mark rober like if u agree
I love how when you reach 60 degrees there's this Polish guy on the chat spamming "Jebać disa"
Found a comment on PH from 8 months ago saying 'Because kinetic energy can be converted into thermal energy, technically you could slap a chicken at 3275.5mph to cook it' PH always predicts the future
hahaha
How do we know you didn't just swap the steak when you went off camera?  ( Here's one I prepared earlier...)
jebać disa xd dobre
People be like : when do Human trials begin. Children with low test scores : when did they stop?
Imagine being a chicken and seeing that this was the thing made with your body. I'd be proud man.
This guy is a comedian and a liar
This dude is beating his beat, literally.
This was in my recommendation but i refreshed the page by mistake and it got lost so i searched this up              I brought a change to the I'm here after youtube recommendation comments with this as well
Imagine doin this with ass🤣
69420!! Haha
I am getting Mark Robber vibes
Why YouTube recommend me this
Let me get this straight.......so you NEVER cooked and ate ANYTHING from start to finish with the slapper!!??........wtf?!
I agine what the vegan teacher would think
"The Original Meat-Beater"  Me; (Snickers) Crap, that made me laugh.
hello everyone this is YOUR daily dose of internet.
Imagine clapping someone's cheeks with that
hello everyone this is YOUR daily dose of internet.
So... If I spank my girlfriend she gets hotter?
This video: *exists* memers: invest
Put some garlic and shit in that bag with the steak
I feel like this entire video was a build up to an advert to hello fresh
Why am I reading this guy's name Lose Weight
this man took “meat beating” to a whole new level
Lol
Why was i getting mark rober vibes from ya
It's ironic that everything heats up but the chicken
mark would be proud
It would be funny if in a parallel universe a chicken is trying to cook a human cadaver by slapping it just for the fun of it.
Omg this while  high is incredible
This is how Davie504 cook his meat
Watched the 1st video in which he failed several times. Almost forgot about it until the video showed up in my news feed.
Nothing beats this.
How engineers sous vide their steak
unus annus part two?
Yeah... That didn't look cooked to me
9:40 Forgive my skepticism, but he took the steak off camera before he removed it from the bag. That's sus
did I hear a Mark Rober sound!?
Dude, seriously, all that hardware, and no proper metal knife and fork...? Really??
10:34 "it tastes like you've been chewing it for a minute already" well, close
Gee, I guess the idea of making a SHAPED "slap-surface" to impact the chicken never occurred to you?  If you want to dissipate the energy of a slap onto an irregular surface, one would have to make a surface that matched the impact surface in a cup-n-ball fashion. [E.G. if you want to slap a ball and dissipate the energy evenly/effectively/efficiently, you would make an impact surface that fit 'around' the surface to be hit, like a bowl fits over a ball.     I guess before you started your youtube channel ( and try to imitate Colin Furze at every opportunity) you didn't have much actual real-life, hands-on mechanical experience, right? Just a lot of playing.....with toys.....and with little kids....
I'm so sorry but the hand/slapper isn't heated to around 36°C so it doesn't simulate a human slap 😥 I'm terrible but it's an opportunity to try it again?
JD
*Man invents automatic slapping cooker* Asian parents: *invest*
1:05 peoples love life
The mad man did it
Now thats a food theory
He can destroy entire covid atoms by just slapping
The ragged effect increasingly poke because charles inexplicably rejoice near a penitent weed. bloody, unsuitable taurus
Mark rober music = +20 intelligence
Davie504 shoul see this video
F for all the chicken that died just to participate in this experiment
The mad man did it....
You can't claim this is the ONLY chicken cooked by slapping, how do you confirm this claim?
Give that chicken a good *S L A P P*
Hello everyone, This is YOUR Daily Dose of Internet.
When man meat meets women meat during extended hours of fertilization which do you think will be cooked?
i was always so curious about this
amazingly done
lmaooo
Davie504 liked this
Wow this is the most impractical way to cook a chicken but good job for doing your experiment.
He beat the meat 😂
Davie is proud of you
If ur ever gonna do this again can u add some spices and flavouring it might make the steak more enjoyable :)
1:05 'The original meat beater,' lmfao
How the hell are you cutting a steak with plasticware
S L A P S C I E N C E
Imagine if your mom called you and asked what your doing and you said "im beating my meat"
chicken born just to be slapped
Pretty sure whenever he said Meatbeater, our minds went somewhere else...fun video nonetheless
imagine if you're being torture by that butt slapper
TRY THIS  WITH  A LIVE CHICKEN
This guy took science to the next level
IT'S FUCKING RAW!
Hi Louis, I work for NASA. I really think that your onto something here. I could definitely see this technology used for a space based application. We’ll be in touch.
Mean while the guy who found a way to light a fire : I am a son of a bitch who tried to make things simple.
Davie504 approves
I watched the first video and now i'm proud that this guy just did it
You made it to daily dose of interny
10:18 omg i died haha!
F
@Davie504 would love it.
@Davie504
I’m get mark rober vibes from this vudeo
K but how hard would you have to hit it to cook it in 1 slap or punch?
Ayam geprek?
when i was young, i settled myself on pressure cookers to do cooking with pressure. not today!
Daily dose of internet ?
Holy shit he did it....
The slapp part 3
Well yes, but food that remains between 41F and 160F for an extended period has the tendency to become toxic for other reasons. You may pasteurize it but I still wouldn't recommend consuming it. Not unless you are able to get that pasteurization in a time span of say... an hour.
Wouldn't be the first time you ate from  the slapper
can we burn it??????
Where I live we use fahrenheit for science
Now I am curious to see the results whenever he decides to create & test the infamous Toy Car Dart Gun from Fallout 3 / Fallout New Vegas.
Oh shit, bro, is it the ora ora machine?
Never knew All gas no breaks had a chef brother
Stupid....
This gives me major mark rober vibes
The meat beater 90000😂😂
Historians: fire was discovered about a million years ago  People before 1 million years ago:
MB9001: now available at an adult toy store near you
Imagine reading this in history textbooks in the next 100 years. Fucking epic
The fact that i got this in my recommendation is......confusing🙄
I bet your neighbours low key hate you
WHY
Mom:son,what are you doing Me:wathing a man creating a meat slapping machine Mom:ok....
Are you tired of making steaks without the soothing sound of skin slapping together, do you wanna make a childish dirty joke every time you cook? Then allow me to introduce you to “The Meat Beater” the newest and “barest” way to prepare your beef, cumming to stores near you! ( beef and meat beater sold separately. Power source for the meat beater is your problem not ours so good luck with that.)
I've read a lot of comment, but not a single "it's time to beat some meat" joke has appeared.
Man is mark rober 2.0
Daily Dose of Internet, anyone?

>Real science is measured in C!!!!  *sigh* No, its measured in K. Get out of her Europeans :)  in reality a scientist can go between all three pretty easily. Remember folks, C to F is just multiple by 9/5 and add 32, and to go from C to K is just add 273. If you're really all about how scientific your units are, this math is easy, right?
Next episode: Wagyu Beef Slapped to Perfection
Finally some scientific research worth investing in
You could probably improve the steak by searing it after the slapping, like you would with a sous vide.
This is what quarantine has led to huh, anyways here from the daily dose of internet lol
Saw this on daily dose of internet this morning, now I searched for a good chicken recipe to eat for dinner and found this 😂
Is there's no  Girls:Let's cook something in the oven *Boys* : Comment?Impressive Edit:Yes,I know you sick of it too
Is there's no  Girls:Let's cook something in the oven *Boys* : Comment?Impressive
The tenderest steak you've ever had
I came here by daily dose of internet
Alright now try cooking with -vibration -sound -acceleration
Stop spanking your chicken dude...Then he beats his meat... *PITIFUL!*
Ok mark rober
mark rober 2.0 LESS GOOO
I honestly don't know how I ended up here but no regrets
I thumbed up for the 69420th slap
I've never slapped a chicken but I sure have choked one out.
The prophecy is true
That mark rober music.
I bet that chicken slaps.
This is great, but I'm curious: I'd have thought the steak would be cooked weirdly evenly, but the outside looked almost seared. Why would that be? Is something impeding the Maillard reaction inside the steak, or is it actually hotter on the surface for some reason?
This videos topic is about on par with ending murder by using nukes to wipe out humanity... no humans no murder... Is it worth doing? Not for most people :P
Roasted, deep fried, smoked, boiled, SLAPPED
Why did I get a slapping a chicken to make it blush recommendation?
***meat beater 9000***
well, its 1am and here I am, literally watching some dude on youtube beat his meat...
This man needs way more subscribers
The meat beater 9001..?? Uhhh,uhhhh.. is there somewhere to buy one. 😳
not bad mark rover copy same music almost same stuff but not as cool or good
How did I watch this whole video and he didn’t even successfully do it? And he gave up... I mean yea it takes a lot of hard work but he didn’t even see it through, at best he succeeded on a technicality. Get your ass back in the lab and do it the right way kid
Qué acabo de ver? Xdxd
Budget mark rober
Everyone gangsta till the mark rober music kicks in
this guy sounds cringe but the project is cool tho
Who is this? Mark Rober???
*childhood flashbacks*
The meatbeater 😫
Lol meat beater 🤭
Video made in 2021 or 1980? 🤷🏽‍♂️
1:05 the what 🤔
The algorithm showed me a horsefly getting electrocuted then this
Myth busters did this already. Get ur own content bum
Davie would be proud ;p
Now these guys are answering the real big questions
"The original meat beater"  13yo me: Hold my pop!  😂
If that like button was the Slapper, that chicken would have been cooked in no time!
I know you're gonna make a part 2 for it, congratulations man you did it!
You  didn't use a jack hammer why?
Davie504 just entered the chat
I was actually thinking about the original video a few days ago! Omg!
I like this modern science for kids 😂
I've never laughed so hard.  Try putting the chicken in front of a large speaker and blasting it with sound.  I  call it the macro wave. CHEERS!🤣🔊🐓
Uhhhhhhhhhh. what did i see?
This is awesome dude you just invent way to cook chicken that people wont think that way would work out
He sounds a lot like mark rober
No wonder things get hot when I beat the meat
Well if nothing else this shows the importance of safety factors. Better to design your rig to be 2 times as durable as you theoretically need so that it doesn't break 5 times due to unexpected errors.
im supposed to have been asleep 3 hours ago... no regrets
"Cooks by slapping"  Fire? Overrated.
Feels like a Colin furze cross Peter schripol
1:05
sometimes you just have to slap the chicken
sps: Slap Per Second lmao
BEAT. THAT. MEEEEEAT!
When you have no oven but you're an A+ student in science fairs
This is how Davis504 cooks his food. “SLAPP chicken now!” But seriously like the video it’s good.
I wonder why we don't cook more things this way
Just proves steak beats chicken.
Who’s here from daily dose of internet?
I desperately want Davie504 to react to this video
9:20 chat made me proud
@Davie504 cooking basses since 1834
I would suggest using V8 engine next time
My dad did this to my mom but she didn't get cooked
So basically you found a way to beat your meat, make it hot, but not perverted. COOL!!!!
I don't know Gordon Ramsey will be proud...
that's one way to beat your meat
Disgusting crap waste of time
prehistory: grilled chicken Iron Age: baked chicken 18th century: fried chicken 2000: boiled chicken 2021: slapped chicken
Please Celcius like a real scientiest instead of that wimpy "C"
I thought of doing this but after 2 mins of thinking ...I order chicken from Zomato😂😂😂😂😂
Its really perfect when you put it on your son BUTT 👍
Putting lube on the meat slapper. Hah
So the more you beat your meat, the chances of cooking it goes higher. Got it.
mark rober but not mark rober, impresive tho
This is obviously ridiculous but it amazes me how intelligent and creative the new generation has become.
Now do it with Wagyu A5
Put a pocket p*say on da end Nd let it do it’s job😎
meme mark rover
Gordon Ramsay watching this 👀🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
Memento mori
Skip to 9:21 to avoid the introduction.
Same backround Music as Mark Rober
Content so good I didn’t mind watching the ad at the end
I think we can all conclude that the cooked meat flavor did not, in fact, slap.
Getting to the end of this to have you say "honestly the texture is pretty bad" made my night
Ew medium rare
It’s 3:00AM and I’m watching some dude show me how he beat his meat. :/
Imagine going to restaurant and see chef slap their chicken to cook it
Brotha...
Now to try beat some meat lol
I know how this chicken feels, we all know
memento mori.
Is peter siripol helping you?
that is a pretty face meat beater
I thought studied in engineering is boring ......
I never thought I could enjoy just watching another man beat his meat, and then eat it... but 2021 is full of surprises.
Do it in one slap and I'll be impressed
I can just imagine someone yelling at him in the middle of the night asking what he's doing and he just replied replies with im betting my meat
🤣🤣🤣
The Russian Badger needs to see this
Davie504 would be proud
Some one get the RussianBader
"Thats not true"  well then you didn't cook it
"Taste so good... make you wanna slap yo momma!"  🤣
nice
I will wait for Gordon Ramsay to start selling slapped chicken in his restaurants around the world. Only at that point will I see this as a legitimate cooking method.
Jotaro be eating good tonight
Alternate Title: Chicken get his meat beated
Original thumbnail had a white flat platform about to slap chicken
Holy moly he reminds me of Mark Rober :D  Nice video!
Best YouTube video EVER!!!!!!!!
Damn man, that chicken looks like it slapped.
You made a steak for people whom lost their teeth
Real scientists use Kelvin not Celsius... sheesh
All this for meme
The question wasn't how many slaps to cook it, it was how hard you'd have to slap it one time to cook it
HOW CAN SHE SLAP?!?!
Real science uses Kelvin
So that's how people cooked food before the discovery of fire.
Unus Annus would be proud
Nice
I hope he doesnt get salmonella.
Wow I saw the last one, didn't expect you to actually do it. Congratulations!
I like how the sponsor is about not wasting food but these tests are a huge waste of meat
This is cool and all but I'm still waiting for a boxer to run a chickens fade till it's cooked
Watching this at 12:00 am and getting caught by my parents and trying to explain why im watching a dead chicken  getting slapped
my wife needs to improve her slaprate lol
meat beater
Honestly, your description of the steak makes me think that people with muscle dystrophy would greatly benefit from a meat beater...
Imagine Gordon Ramsay trying it😂😂
All I can think about is how many incredible and helpful things you could have done with the time, thought, Resources, and energy you put into this ridiculous project.
So if I beat my meat for 8 hours, it eventually will become a cooked sausage
using a rubber paddle to slap with, would have saved you so many redesigns
Thank you for saying "pasteurization" of chicken instead of specifying a temperature at which chicken is "done".  Although, for anyone who's ever tasted chicken pasteurized at 57C, they'll agree there's another reason why 75C is the goal.  Can you say "texture" boys and girls?  I knew you could!
I mean they were wrong the scientific degree of temperature is calculated in kelvin most if not all the time if he wanted to be even more accurate he shoulda used kelvin
I couldve been an engineer
Skulker would be proud his dream became a reality also I remembered the og vid
My little brain can't comprehend that the steak went in uncooked and came out lookin like THAT. I instantly thought it was a trick. After watching the whole of this vid, and the last one, my tiny mind was just too blown away
The Russian Badger needs to see this...
I promised myself I’d sleep tonight
World record
i love the internet
Is the meat bass enough for Davie?
1:05 hehe he said meat beater
You know the video is going to be good when the Mark Rober music starts playing.
Its absolutely amazing that you were able to achieve a crispy brown skin on the chicken, judging from the thumbnail.
This video's a slap yo
Why not beef stake? Makes more sense its slow cooked, pounded till tender and it seems more natural to pound steak than a chicken carcass
This guy is really smart and all, but two let's go's in a row? Nope, I'm out
They called him a mad man.
I need a meat beater.
nevermind, i have oven at home
how do u know it's the only one
"meat beater"
Beating the shit out of chicken to kill germs eh... I guess that works on humans too because I haven't been sick in a long time... Thank you mom and dad
Use this on space. It's useful
The earthy moat intriguingly tire because internet multivariably rescue around a violet daisy. flat, glistening glorious alibi
Never cut a steak with a plastic knife
lol do I even need to say anything
"the original meat beater"  yeah... ok.
Davie504 be like:finnaly a worthy opponent our battle will be legendary
NASA engineers when they make a YouTube channel:
In place of variac I use lightdimmers with triac. Modding it with a bit of heatsink can improve power capacity somewhere between 15-20A. Not better but much smaller.
The amount of dirty jokes in this video is out of this world
Who's here after DDOI
Where was the seasoning though?! 😭
bruh
Disappointed but also appointed
Must hate that piece of meat so much to be slapping it that much 😂
The abundant numeric relevantly like because theater coronally clear beyond a false familiar famous shingle. successful, lowly glove
this gives me mark rober vibes
Subbed
This dude is gonna be on Discovery Channel's 'You have been Warned'
Put a dong on that, and get a girl. You will have a video Sr!
People did this before ovens rights
Ur a bad engineer way to many hiccups u needa prepare more of course get steel.metal wtf point one and over heating issues is common. Ur pretty bad  glad u have dumb fans to keep u going
I cant believe im watching this .
Did you. Copy this off?  Mrbeasts brother?
TheRussianBadger sent me here.
Who's here from unus annus
Weisz the real question is why did you do that?
i mean i lost my faith in the video when he went in and came out
I thought you might have a cooking technique of the future until you said the texture was shit very informational tho
Bro wtf you’re legit hilarious 😂
Now cook it in one slap
Beat the meat
who copied who mark or him
I slap like now
Good thing you didn't give up to this roast slapped chicken
sucks you didn't eat it. I bet you'll go the rest of your life regretting not persevering just a little more in order to take a bite.
and the award for the best meat beater is...
*B O N K*
Never in my life have i ever dreamed about the day i could scroll on youtube and hear someone says “slap per second”
Meatbeater9001 shall become my new name on COD
Imagine Gordon Ramsay notices this
Am I the only one concerned with how they are going to season the chicken?! LOL since the first video all I could think was, " Okay, but what about the FlAvOuR??"
UNUS ANNUS UNUS ANNUS UNUS ANNUS
7:34 Noubidy: bro just use a flamethrower
davie504 is proud
I need to go to bed
Slap the chicken to make it slap when you're eating it.
"why u need oven if u already have a hand"
Am I the only one that thinks his voice sounds like "Mark Rober"
I'm so invested in this since I watched the last attempt 😂
I reckon some rich guy would pay alot to eat a chicken cooked by slaps
Ok, hello fresh is actually REALLY good, especially compared to the competition, it is a bit more expensive that others but, it is SO much better.
This should be called "way to much time on ya hands"
All has no breaks is everywhere this week!
Everyone: "so what did you do during covid?"  louis weisz:
bet that steak could be made pretty tender if you used a better cut
hes to dangerus too be alive.
Ik you won't see this, but Congratz man! I saw the original video and it's awesome to see that you finally did it! Haha 💯👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
The hell???
Here we go, the meat beater
YOOO HE DID IT
So, you just literally beating your meat 🍖 ✊🏻
I use hello fresh!
I see you’re a wear tester for MarsYard 2.5 👀
You can't hear someone say “meat beater” and not think... Well you know
Can’t wait to see slap cooked chicken appear in some quirky restaurant menus in a few years.
Not the video i wanted in my recomended but the video i needed
This is the type of kid at school who takes every joke seriously
DAMN I THOUGHT THIS MEME WILL BE FOR EVER JUST A MEME
Ok, I'm not watching this video . I just stopped by to say I'm glad you didn't cook a chicken by "chokeing"  it. Why don't you just  build a nice tensigrity table like everyone else. Freak.
Haha finally
should colab with Mark Rober
i clicked so fast!!! this was so cool
HOW CAN SHE SLAP???
F for the pivot
1:18 why do I hear mark rover music
dats still some raw chicken to my taste and eyes lol
The first oven was invented in 1490. People in 1489:
Did you at least season the chicken?
Now, how can we slap common sense into people? 🤔
So like when you beat your meat are you slowly cooking it then?
Me: So how do you cook the chicken? Chef: we slap the hell out of it
Verry interesting, would watch if it was 3 minutes instead of 13....
Next cook with rubbing friction
Dude just slap it yourself 🤯
cooks steak Says it smells like steak  insert *you don't say* meme
Lol, I remember the first video and thought it was super silly.  You pulled it off.  Great work.  Can you cook other things with it?
i wish i had that slapping machine
Idk why I clicked on this video but now I'm interested
can i cook my wife with this?
1:08 pause.. ayo
mark rober copy
The righteous protest conservatively inject because wing analogously type as a overt rose. waiting, imaginary lobster
Imagine actually using it to beat your "meat"
Damn
So now I've seen someone beating the meat for thousands of times . Nice :)
Memento Mori.
That's rare rare
Davie504 should know this
ngl this kinda slaps
Very proud of you man, I remember watching the first video. Persistence is everything.
actually, you use kelvin for science alongside SI 2:17
Chicken isn’t cooked until 63°c
fak. news presedint! trump.  2024
actually use kelvin for real science, alongside SI.  2:20
the steak looked like a rug
This is the pinnacle of human  ingenuity
This gonna trigger PETA and Vegan at the same time 😁
gordon ramsay approves
Someone's been watching Mark Rober
you achieve transcendence when you eat it
*sighs* unus annus
My Low iq I fucking can’t  understand anything but good video
Professional idiots😹😹 Made my day
I disliked Because Fahrenheit won 2 world wars, I’d say we can determine what real science numbers are
By 2020 we will have flying cars 2021:
i am SHOCKED that this wasn’t clickbait
Meat beater?.Nothing can beat my hand
.. dot dot
Why did I get suggested this....and why did I click on it?😂
Ok youtube, I clicked the link. Can you stop reccomending this to me?
I love how it too a crack team of yt smarties to get this done, amazing
The invincible radio probably heat because ball numerically accept vice a grumpy lipstick. goofy, concerned ship
Omagash I watched first time you did this a while ago😂😂 Congrats man!!😆🔥
Davie504 wants to know your location.
I  say try and get a crust on the steak first then start slapping, or get it after that might help with texture
Omg he Actually did it.
"Scientists were too busy asking if they could, they forgot to ask of we should" - idk
dude looks like Peter MacNicol son
Greatest comment section ever
Best hello fresh commercial ever.
this is the most complicated way to cook a chicken for dinner but im loving it
What a madlad
Stupid bbq. And all I had to do was slap a cow
Fake, if this was true my missus would be burnt to the crisp.
I’m glad songs that Mark Rober uses are in this video. This way, you know it’s gotta be a banger video.
Him: cooks chicken by slapping it  Me: can't remember what 6x4 is
Never knew that everyday I  cook at home I'm making my own meal Kit for way less hahaha.
imagine being the ghost of that chicken and watching what they did to you
Omg. Ya slapped the shit outta your meat till cooked.    Thats fortitude lmao
It don’t count
Thankyou for using degrees Celsius
this is how Davie504 cooks his chicken
the meat beater 9000💀💀💀
That looks like someone just shat on a plate and handed it to you 😂
9:42 .... you walk in to the bathroom with the bag open... and you switched out the meat 🥱
That’s so crazy you’re absolutely insane, inane, not mundane youre crazy fool
"Hey what do we eat as dinner tonight?   "The meat I beat"
the live comment thing at the top is all i ever stare at and they were like "sLaP tHaT ThIcK bOiIiI!"
This is a harrow tale of man versus nature and I am completely transfixed.
When you dont now how to make a chicken with an oven
Gordon ramsay watching this be like
Davie504 would appreciate this slapper
Kelvin is used for real science
Me on first day of NNN
Celsius is inferior to Fahrenheit. If we lived in the water, it'd be perfect. However in the air with the smaller temperature gradiations, Fahrenheit is the winner. Whenever I do anything with science, I always use Fahrenheit for temperature, and US Customary for everything else.
3:29 *PAUSE* look at chat. It says, “Slap me daddy”
You big phony. Go cook a chicken to 74!
Maybe a new slapper design - like spinning rubber flaps kinda like in a carwash, the spinning brushes slapping the top and sides of the car. Maybe less strain on the motor, no up/down reversal of force of energy, it is a more "linear" circular force.
Mark Rober entered the chat...
6:39 That's what she said
Imagine being slapped so much so hard that you are cooked alive like damn I wanna cook myself now-
yoooo dude this chicken slaps, whats your secret?   him:
This man got  the slaps if a million sun's
That'd kill you..  Please don't get food poisoning... chicken needs extra cooking so not raw sick... Oh dear... Good video though!
Mini Mark Rover💀
Mark robber dejavu
This is the absolute dumbest video that I have ever come across. Subscribed.
Title should be "American forced to use Celsius instead of monke heat points"
That slap forced me to remember my physics teacher  And i took this personally
you can say it was HAND MADE         I'll just leave now
I am really sure those bacterias got a swollen faces from that slapper
Gotta love that midnight YouTube algorithm 😂
"this video is sponsored by hello fresh" yup cool who cares we came to see chicken get slapped to shit (proceeds to skip)
Why is it called the meat beater? 😳😩
This guy is super smart
Him: meat beater 9000 Me: how do you know my nickname 🧐
Me throughout the whole video not knowing anything about engineering - “I like your funny words magic man”
6.6 M people : uhhhmmm this is interesting... 😅😅😅
Who is hear because of daly dose of internet
Meat beater
"Crack team of engineers" *cuts to ms paint*
This type of content fills the hole in my soul that Mythbusters left.
This brings new definition to beating your meat 🍗
I don't know what he's talking about and I have no idea about math but I love watching this kind of experiment lol
Karate chopping
Youve got to take a living chicken, they not getting cold so far
Him: The original meat beater Me: I see I’m still legendary!
Imma call bullshit simply because of the way it's edited. Plus he walked off with the so called slap cooked meat then came back, who is to say he didn't just swap it with something that was already cooked
Now cook pasta with slaps
imma make my own meat beater
Now that’s what I would call beating meat
thats raw, dude. 60C doesnt even near get rid of bacteria
Is 3 am and I am watching this , worth it
*HE DID IT!!!!*
12:45 looks like an Brazilian meal  Ps:I'm brazilian
Original Meat Beater was my nickname in high school
F
When beating that meat becomes a success!
This brings a whole new meaning to "Beating your meat".
Meat Beater 9000? That’s what I call my right hand mallet. Perfect for grounding beef.
people before invented fire be like    "finally somebody found the lost ancient technologies"
Scale for "real science" said no one around the world when imperial math was used to create the war machines that whooped all the metric system war machines.
Damn, no seasoning?? Not even lemon pepper???
10:22 immediately dies due to food poison*
Imagine going to a restaurant and getting a steak that was slapped to perfection
Is that the peter plane pickle eater I seed !!
My guy knows how to slap his MEAT 🍖 👏🏼
@Davie504
*The Meat Beater 😩*
The Mythbusters would be proud...
I wonder if @penguin0 knows about the unique slapping power of this MB9001.
Fuck firing up the grill.. FIRE UP THE SLAPPER 👋
So... has davie504 seen this?
I love how I went from laughing at the idea to delving into in science in .5 seconds lul
The quixotic delete parenthetically apologise because august systematically branch anenst a lackadaisical woman. incandescent, therapeutic fire
2:19 sorry we dont use commie numbers
I wonder what davinci would think of this
stop making excuses and slap a chickin until it smokes.
Hmmm no joke in the comments about people being there own meat beater 9000🤔that’s strange
How much do your neighbors hate you tho? 😂
Ok YouTube, I watched it.
The best signifier of a good YouTuber is when I ask myself why I watched something after the video is already over. That means I actually watched the whole thing without losing interest before I even realized I actually wasn't interested in it. This is actually a major compliment, even if it doesn't sound like it.
Democratic: stoves create to much smoke/steam. Mass produces meat beater.
man finally did it
"Would this cook a human though" 2:31
this feels like fulfilling the unus annus prophecy
Technically it's spanking the chicken
Typical scientist... Lower the output expectation to consider the experiment a success. We all want to see an actual fully cooked chicken at 165 or better.
That chicken must've slapped
Davie504 would be proud
Imagine having the time and resources to do shit like this
Davie504 wants to know your location
Chicken not cooked sorry, you have to make it slap even faster, stronger material but weigh lighter
Why didn't you just made 2 machines? So they could take turns while you work on repairs if there are
Daily Dose Of Internet
Guy you all overthought it, just bring in my mom and say something remotely offensive
I have an exam in 3 hours and I just watched a 3 part series on slap cooking a chicken
you should marinate the chicken first
Davie504 wants to know your location
this is such a bdsm kink toy
OMG YOU FINALLY COOKED THE CHICKEN 😭😭
How can she slap?
Okay, excellent Meat Beater aside, as an Asian person, I'm just very happy that he has a rice cooker. White people deserve to have good, uncolandered rice too.
see you in 25 years
lauri will bring his press to america to crush you now
9:20 patrzcie czat XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
This puts my oven to shame
why r u doing this davie?
You should try using water brake to cook a soup. It's a lot easier, but still fun to watch. Like, waaaaaay easier.
Ya tried again eh? Haha
this video...dare i say...slaps
Davie504 will smile if he sees this
Have you beat your meat today??? Lol
Thought I was watching a mark Rober vid for a sec
THE FUTURE IS HERE!! GET SLAPPED YOU DAMN CHICKEN
Absolutely incredible, beautiful work. Seriously, well done man.
Something fishy
unus annus would be proud
That's it. We reached peak humanity. It's all downhill from here.
My wife: what are you watching? The guy sound really excited Me: I watching this guy beat his meat until its cooked. My wife: the fuq 🤨 what?  True story
0:44 How DARE you claim that the Hydraulic Press Channel had a less than perfect suggestion?!?  Blasphemy!  Just who do you think you are?  ;-P
Ah yes....the Meat Beater 9000😩
U made it to daily dose of internet. Congrats
Smh😔....just open your eight gate and punch it with flaming fists
0:57 That Mark Rober music 10/10
This guy is the young mark rober
9:35 u welcome
Video starts at 2:33
Later!
Hey guys it’s youuurrrr daily dose of internet
Does this experiment counts as a part of Cartoon Physics studies?
Wife: honey, we need a new oven. Let's buy the slapper thing we saw online! Me: who are you?! I don't have a wife!!
Love this, watched the original attempt video back then, glad to see the results of hard work!
NIce video! I wonder if you can do it indirectly, like slap a metal container so it heats up, which acts like an oven to cook the chicken inside. This way you can slap it way harder and way faster.
Gordon: Finally some good F*ckin' Food
how would you like your steak sir?     SLAPPED !
What's the big deal about 69420
UNNUS ANNUS
OK this is weird but like four years ago my brother and I were on vacation he’s 14 now so he was 10 and he just randomly had this idea while eating chicken and he slapped me on the arm and then he randomly said he was going to cook a chicken through the power of slapping with kinetic energy and I kid you not for years later I find this video in my recommended it’s crazy to see someone was so like-minded
This man stupid as hec like how dumb can u be       Just use a bow with flam on it duh
Meat beater 9002
I got excited when I thought you were going to SEASON YOUR FOOD 😒.... that was the most disappointed thing about this video
Everyone: Fahrenheit sucks Me who doesn't know how to calculate Celsius: wut
Now I know what I'll call my right arm...
Poultry pamper 9001 PP9001
The fact that you used Celsius to measure cooked meat was infuriating. Who cares if the internet hivemind is in love with Celsius. You cook meat with FAHRENHEIT.
Your video is featured on Daily Dose Of Internet 😀
Bob Ross would have been proud
Who's here after daily dose of internet
for me that stake is still a little raw
Why not have the machine slap in circles? As in 360 degrees?
*smack* “YOU CLOSE? YOU CLOSE?!”
I didn't know I would be arguing with my mom about slapping chickens today
@davie504 you could cook this with one slap
Wait what did you do with all the chicken you didn't eat? Bobcats?
This gives me big micheal reeves vibes
I'll have the slap-fried chicken
Animal testing complete.  When do human trials begin?
Greetings from Finland!
I'm glad he cooked the rice using the rice cooker.
Frog approved
Yo! You're on Daily Dose!
Next time start with a live one for extra flavor
this guy takes beating his meat VERY serious
you can officially say, that you have beat that meat. full respect sir...
I hear mark rober music or am I trippin'?
*Insert meat beating joke*
Imagine the insults Ramsay could make
You are eating death animals which are brutaly slapped after death before your mum ... god is dead.
Yo that chicken bussin 😳
Ah my friend, you may not know but, I have already achieved this righteous feat as I have my OWN, “Meat Beater 9000”.
Slap LIKE Slap BASS Slap CHICKEN
Wtf am I watching
People before fire was discovered...
This is cool but the chicken doesn’t looked cooked I won’t eat it
"I cooked a chicken by slapping it" 6.5m people in 4 days: interestingggg
And what zoidberg would say “I‘ll TAKE 8!”
finally
I have a very strong desire to slap like now.
I need a fucking machine that works at this speed.
The return of the slap. Slapsgiving 2021. You need the slap of a thousand burning suns, my child.
When oven too expensive.
6,499,442 views in 4 days?! Clearly I don't understand human nature.
You have all that equipment, and all that knowledge to slap cook meat, and you cut a steak with a plastic fork and knife?🤯
Holy shit he actually did it 😂😂😂! I knew it was worth the sub!
The meat beater 2000
Lol you sound like MrBeast
You could say he beat his meat.
again you should have named it the Meat Beater 69,001....
Fuckin eh sixty nine four twenty
Achievement unlocked MEAT BEATER
The most elaborate cheat code ever
Only 3 times as much electricity as it would take to cook in an oven?!  I’m shocked that it’s not waaaaay more inefficient than that! There’s obviously a considerable amount of energy lost to the heat in the electronics which doesn’t go into the meat, not to mention the whole thing was bouncing around the floor like crazy and it’s obviously considerably much noisier than an oven so that’s some energy lost to sound.   Are ovens just MASSIVELY inefficient on their own? Like if you cut the chicken to bits and cooked it super efficiently (perhaps an updated method of burying it with hot coals?), you could do it with a fraction of the energy used by a conventional oven?
2021: " You can now cook chicken by slapping it " 2030: " You can now cook chicken by using a dog "
Adjustable Slap Depth is reason enough to watch this video
How I Met Your Mother would be proud
came here from daily dose of internet what about you guys....
I work at hello fresh so just know I know 🌚
Is this how chickens will be cooked in mars?
The science behind this is fantastic. As of this moment there are 6.4 million views, that's more than some cable tv shows. But to be fair this is much more interesting than most cable tv shows anyway.
idk
Kelvin is the measurement for real science
The poultry punisher
Love the Mark Rober music
*I cooked a chicken by slapping it*  6mil people interesting
You're lucky you didn't eat that chicken. Food poisoning is real and sucks ass.
Damn missed the opportunity to say that the meat slapped
I want gordon ramsey to cook a steak by this.
My man Davie504 gunna challenge this to a slap battle real soon
Boy said meat beater
meatslapper 9001, oh you're so silly!
It physically hurts knowing I could never be this smart
tldr   slap the meat it’s good to eat
Unus Annus could NEVER
That's right. Louis Weisz 1, Kyle Hill 0.
Holy shit I completely forgot about this until it popped up in my recommended.
he used mark rober’s montage  music
I just noticed that your background music is the same as Phylosophy tube's so nice to find that coincidence 👌😍
That's why folks just cook the chicken in a pan
aaaaaand im subscribing
slow cooked slap chicken
This is the first time I've watched a video of a guy beating his meat.
Gotta get it to 350
I veto this for using the metric system. Also you claim is incorrect - real science is done in standard. Because we like to say, there are two kinds of countries: those who use metric, and those who have been to the moon. I rest my case :)
I just watched a man talking about slapping a chicken for 13 minutes and 16 seconds
Why are you in Peters shop?
When unus annus could never
You always chew like a cow when eating steak?!? Freakin cannibal!
your on daily dose of internet
Gotta make than chicken crispy too!
Who would’ve thought that this was Hello Fresh sponsered.
You don't need it to be 165F. That's only if you want to instantly kill salmonella. You can kill it at lower temps. Just not instantly
This video is so disgusting that I am thinking of going vegan
Chicken Steak or Chicken Mi-Steak
My respect for the guy spamming beat that meat beat that meat beat that meat in the chat: 📈📈📈📈📈
So technically you could cook the animal without killing it?
10:05 blood
Now... Now I understand.   11pm "I should be sleeping soon"  3am (how many slaps to cook a chicken)
Cooking meat by beating it? Nice.
Ok you can get the chicken all the way to 40° with slaps, but you couldn't make the same to 60°, from all the beginning, so, starting at 40 is a cheat xD
Me and future son in year 2040 -Mom for how long do I have to cook the chicken? -135k slaps should be okay son
seriously.. what a dumb way to cook a chicken
I saw this right after seeing this on daily dose of internet 👀
Davie504 would be really proud of this.  Slap like nowwww
Who else is reading the comments to see if it's clickbait (it's not btw)
POV: this was in ur recommended
He has discovered a new breakthrough in cooking technology!
Im gaining knowledge
This is the very essence of engineering!
raw asf🤣
This is the next mark rober
Try choking your chicken it might heat up more
Why am I watching this?
Anyone come here through DDOI?
Mom: "Why do you want to be an engineer?" Me: "It's complicated."
All of that just for you to not eat the chicken
This man takes beating his meat to the next level 😂😂😂😂😂
I don't slap chicken, I slap turkey.
Thats not cooked chicken damn it. clickbait
Michael Reeves but  *not on crack *not a goblin *not a 3 foot Filipino *actually tall *pretty nice
H
It all returns to the RussianBadger
Dude... just use an oven... 🤣🤣
The original meat beater. Brings me back to an awkward moment at science camp.
How could I not click on this
People in hundreds or even thousands of years from today will come to revisit this historic moment
What the actual fuck did I just watch.
69420!
MY GUY BEATING HIS MEAT ON YOUTUBE
mark rober music tho so proffesional
Talk about beating your meat.
Now cook it in one single slap.
The Mark Rober music though, fits perfectly for this video!
SOMEONE FINALLY DID IT OMG
Mark rober v2
And then the patent was bought by a dominatrix
He slapped the hell out of his meat and was thoroughly enjoying it.
is this a mark rober parody? tf
Davie504 is gonna be p***ed when he finds out that he’s been out slapped...
Yooo, We have the same last name!!
I like how literally every part of the machine decided to overheat and break before the chicken did
So horny guys dont slap your rod too much, you'll cook it
Never knew mark rober had a child
Imagine a restaurant where everything is cooked by slapping.
Mark Rober: Copy, Paste.
He is like a more technical Mark Rober
100 years ago: Starving, has no means of acquiring or cooking a chicken 2021: "I cooked a chicken by slapping it"
What in the unholiest of all f**KS did I just watch?
Cool, but. *UNAMERICAN*
unus annus
Am I the only one here because of Daily Dose of Internet?
Two rigs, offset, slap on both tiddies at the same time. And i will not be satisfied until not only is the chicken cooked and "edible" but properly seasoned and enjoyable. So toss some damn herbs, garlic, and seasoning on that bird. Also lubricate the damn thing with some oil to help with the cooking process. Also wash the chicken off and pay dry before attempting the aforementioned.
davie apporves
What’s the song at 0:57?
"medium rare" that's raw
You remind me of a cursed Mark Rober
Memenade anyone?
i always wonder how do you get to this stage in your life where you're like louis weisz...
Girls : they must have met for other girls. Boys :
This video SLAPS!
Slap a hello fresh meal
What the fuck did i just read  What the fuck did i just watch What the fuck am i doing with my life
Who knew what would happen when you beat your meat for 4 hours straight
Hello Everyone This Is YOUR Daily Dose Of Internet
he beat the meat
Imagine if instead of pouring out the juice he just swapped to an actual cooked steak
I Am No Mother but i like your idea. Do you want to take a tea with me?
But I'm America I needF
do it by hand next
Useless
been following this journey and its been epic, was soo00o excited when i saw this video pop up, keep up the good work, i still wanna see more meat slapper :P
Damn
the absolute dedication it took to get this done
The Mark Rober vibes are immaculate
"The original meat beater."
Maybe Guga needs to use this to tenderize the eye round.
Wow people are very bored
EPICO!!! 69,000,000 SLAPS
Omfg I laughed just seeing the title
This is the only meat that Davie504 can eat.
5:46 the cooking start from here
Geez and I’ve been using lotion to slap my meat this whole time 🙄.
Would a small version on this be called the Mini Masterbater. I mean, the real unit is call the Meat Beater 9000
Ive  never seen someone so excited about 60 degrees😂😂
Davie304 approved
... I've only heard Mark Rober using it before (It could be really common for all I know) but is that the same describing-a-build-over-a-montage bgm?
I want Slapped Chicken as part of my Hello Fresh subscription or no deal.
imagine hearing slapping sounds for 5 hours straight
5:45 look the chat
This is taking "beating meat" to a whole new level
That Chicken Was A Certified Slap
I want to go back to ancient imperial china, kidnap the emperor's head chef. You know, a guy who's probably busted ass for 60 years with 200 years of finest aristocratic cuisine in his family's bloodline, a master to make gordon ramsay look like a mcd burger flipper. I want to take that venerable old master and make him watch people from 500 years in his future cook a chicken by slapping it 135,000 times  welcome to the future, old man
back in my day we slapped out chicken by hand
If I remember correctly, Stephen Colbert ate meat that cooked at room temperature for an obnoxiously long period of time.  So yeah, even if you have the chicken 10C over normal, it WILL cook over time.  It will just take a long time.
Thanks Russian Badger
Imagine being a chicken and growing up in an industrial chicken farm where you are destined to be killed, frozen, packaged, and sold as meat. Then somebody buys your corpse from the supermarket only to humiliate it by buting it in a slaping machine and getting torn to pieces by relentless slaps. It's tough to be a chiken sometimes
That better be some tender a$$ chicken.
Imagine brining/marinating it, searing it then slap cooking.  That would be the most tender, juicy and flavorful chicken ever.
Mark rober 2.0
Guga looking at that steak: I know it doesn't look good now, but just wait....
Davie504 will be proud of you.
Someone should send this the the Russian bager and jello because they had a skit about physical energy into thermal energy and punching a chicken to cook it.
Scam, didnt actually get any meat cooked
Guys like this video, he had to beat his meat a lot and it was really *hard* to make this video.
Oh my lord a vegans worst nightmare ever can’t wait to show this to my English teacher
you did it.                       smh
hi youtube
I feel bad for the chicken. What if you died and I slap cook you
Everybody gangsta until he slaps the chicken manually
8:18 "This is the meat beater 9001"- Louis Weisz 2021
Dude looks and sounds like Seinfeld
thats the most stupid video ive ever seen on youtube. wtf. subscribe.
That’s cool and all, but where’s the seasoning?
11:02 Hi ten from twitch, its avery from youtube!
im waiting for that slapped steak EDIT: HE MADE THE STEAK
S l a p
The Youtuber Balian from Brazil did a video like this (Sorry for bad english i can understand peaplo speaking but i dont know write very good)
The bath helped the steak
Are you sure you aren't mark rober? Dude you and marks videos are so alike with how you talk, the music, and the editing
This was an old video right? I saw this video probably an year back
You at the bathroom at 3am 1:55
Send this to that vega teacher
You know, you're really not slapping it, you're actually spanking it.............
Gotta get Gordon to watch this
Trending yt vids be like
imagine a medium rare chicken. Oh wait.
Liked because of LTT reference
Yes, the epitome of human evolution
I can see this as the future of cooking... slow-cooked and tenderized in 1 go
now i want beef
Unus Annus already did this. If you dont know who they are, then you’re obviously waaay too late and have no idea what im talking about
1:04 this is what I call my left hand I’m ambidextrous so I switch sometimes
You should make a slapped food restaurant
This dude is the “white” Mark Rober
I guess this is the reason why Garcia and those Dominican Republic guys in the baseball team doesn't wants those slapass because they're afraid that their ass would've been cooked sooner or later.
If I used all of the codes for hello fresh i have, I would have enough free food for a month
Can you not make a Kevlar bag and add water in it to surround the meat, so the heat is transferred to the water and stops it from being tough.
You definitley put off some Bill S. preston Esq. Vibes.
now if only we could find a way to do it in one singular slap
Lord only knows that we beat our meat like that too 😂😂😂
That's like...wow. Awesome job man
use the heat from the motor to cook the chicken
So what did you do with your stimmy?  Built the Meat Beater 9001  *instantly disowned*
Yo where Jell-O  at?
Just casually wearing some Mars Yards while slapping chicken
That is terrible and pointless. Why not kill some cats and dogs and put them through the machine. Killing things for attention on YouTube. Psychopathic traits
i didnt realize this was filmed and made in Peter Sripols shop until i saw peter get in frame
Who else is here bc if Daily dose
Who else saw this on Daily Dose of Internet?
Hello everyone this is your daily dose of internet
Anyone else come to read a beat your meat joke?
This made me wonder, how many slaps before I could kill someone?
“Hello everyone, this is YOUR Daily Dose of Internet.”
This popped up in my recommendation right after seeing it on Daily Dose of Internet 🤣
Thanks Fam Ima use this on my siblings if they annoy me
“Meat beater”
This guys literally spent like months maybe years of time trying to figure out how to cook a chicken with slaps like wtf are u doing my man and why am i watching this video rn.
I haven't slept with my wife in a month. Where can I order one of these meat beater 9001s
The madlad did it, he screenshoted the 692420 perfectly.
Why the fuck does he hold his fork like that? Who raised him?
NO SEASONING??!!!
I wonder why am i even watching a guy who  cooked a chicken my mere slappage 🤷‍♂️
All those thousand of years of evolution led to this point............
I figured this out when I was 13. I slapped my chicken so hard it cooked.
Steel!!!!
where the balls is Davie504?
Do a cola with guga foods and slap cook a wagu
Clickbait he didn't cook shit u cheater
a literal meat beating professional
If you eat that tommorow you will none stopping pooppiiinnnghh
I am offended because I am in this video ;-;
You cheated by using the insulation, you didn't only use slaps.
THE MEAT BEATER IM CRYING
Copying william osmans music I see, very original.
This guy doesn't seem to know anything about how to build a rig that will last. Find somebody that can weld and make something out of steel and there wouldn't have been any problems. Breaking bolts? Can't have bought ones that were worth a fuck if they broke that easily. While you're at it hook the rig up to a little gas engine, it would be reliable and efficient.
Who’s here from the meme
C < K
How to beat your meat and eat it too!
Now you need to create the initiative to make something useful. Waste of time, money, and food.
And still no seasoning
History was made
Meat beater lmao
If you're looking into making a 9002, I'd recommend replacing the solid metal bands that hold the striking surface with some kind of spring/ shock. This would help the longevity of your rig and may help reduce over-tenderization. Thank you for doing SCIENCE!
*if Uncle Roger see you cook rice he will be so happy*
When your in trouble at school but your dad picks you up.
That chicken is not cooked. Just look at it.
I don't get the effort put in to do something dumb with the results not-surprisingly being terrible.
Slapped chicken is going to become a trendy expensive entree at restaurants. Mark my words, it will be the next "air-fried".
YouTube has brought this to my attention, and I must say—what the heck did I just watch?
Mark Rober music b like
I have a feeling this will be the topic of Michael Reeves’ new video
I like ya cut g
"hello everyone this is your daily dose of internet"
Someone get Davie504 right now.
Chickens in a 100 meter radius from this guys slap machine:   "you feel a disturbance in the air" *(boss music plays)*
Eee
I wonder how that would work with my meat
memento mori yall
Gonna go slap my chicken.
Put an iron on the head of the slapper, it will give maksimun heat in a slap
I find it funny that a lot of people never subscribed
An idea if you want to continue improving this, if there's an option to reclaim any energy from the impact, that might be useful
I wonder if this kind of meat beating would be so popular on onlyfans
kinda gives a new meaning to the phrase "beat your meat"...
You're the Kentucky ballistics to mark Robers demolition ranch.. If you know you know.. Good video, get your own style
Well someone’s gotta send this to Therussianbadger
Whole new meaning to beating your meat.
I guess it's possible to cook my wife🙂
You need a 3 phases vfd motor
The chicken: oh yeah slap slap me harder daddy
shoulda reverse seared the steak.
Imagine this machine slap your for 1 hour
German Science is no longer the world's finest.
Chicken: What are doing step-hand😳
They called him a madman.
Have @Davie504 Slapp the chicken it will cook within seconds 😆
I’d like to point out this might actually cook a steak perfectly.
mark rober music
*Someone send this to gorden ramsey asap*
who's here because of Daily Dose of Internet lmao
Truly human ambition can overcome all obstacles.  Edit: oh shit, make pulled pork with this! It tenderizes while cooking, it’s perfect!
Who came here because of Daily does of internet
The only thing different to do is to season the chicken
As an american I hate celsius
I feel targeted, I just made hello fresh tonight
Dang, I knew beating your meat was good, but I didn't think it was good enough to stop your meat from being raw
Mother when you slam the door to loud:
Someone tell Geuce

Tonight I played League and somebody in the chat said "we did it, 69420"... and now i know why lol
Can't wait to hear the slapper in restaurants, 8 hour slow cooked slapped chicken, delicious.
The definition of slow cooked...
"Cracked team of Discord engineers" 😂
*"Yeah. Beat that meat"*
I’m so hyped to see that you are a wear tester for the Mars yard 2.5!
i dont think you should eat pink chicken
How you read c Cuz I’m American:(
8:18 I have that - it’s my right arm and hand.
Why do you use Mark Robbers music???
The meat beater
You need to collab with Mark Rober, sir
The Slappers would be so proud
Is this a copy of mark rober ??? Still this is awesome lmao 😂
How do you know this is the first slap cooked chicken ? I mean ... people are creative around the world
He sounds like Zero from gta San Andreas
Meat beater 😏😏😏
Has anything weird shown to you guys through YouTube's algorithm or it it just me?
Now we just need Gordon Ramsay to react on this video.
nut breaker 9001
Holy shit Rick! Look at thaaaaat! Oh my God Rick what are we gonna do when they find out we cook chicken by slapping it ahhh
I know some of girls who would like to borrow this when your done
You make Davie504 proud.
Ok but... why does all this meat go so unseasoned? It's already in a bag yo
I've never been more fascinated by and at the same time disappointed in science
Hahaha I love clickbait bu-
Please keep making it better
Just beat the meat god damn it.
Never thought I’d be watching a random dude on the internet beating his meat for 13 minutes, but here I am
This HAS to be a medapor of something
Your American so use Fahrenheit unless you don't want Americans to watch. Or are you only making videos for people who are more of a scientist  than you are? Because the average American don't have the slightest clue what 10 c is in F. Smh. Way to cave to people who most likely  don't even know what your saying.
Imagine Davie504 doing this shit.. "slappp"
You could say that the food from hello fresh... Slaps   (Also im made I heard no slaps puns)
youtube: hey wanna see a person cook a chicken by slapping it me: sure lol
Now the race is on to be the first person to do it by hand.
Show the steak to Guga Foods.
@Davie504 approve this video
9:20 thank me later and 7:30
But .. why though ?
How many slaps would it took to cook a whole blue whale?
I really wanna know what Gordon ramsay's opinion on this would be
Gordon Ramsay: what are you gonna do with that beef kid, slap it?
i reported this cause this video contains a white guy beating his meat. Unacceptable.
POV: YouTube algorithm has brought you back here
Give your meat a good old slap
The meat beater I wonder if he consulted with his mother first?
this is the pinnacle of technology
what if i clap too many times
Someone is going to need to gather a few thousand people to continuously slap a chicken now
GRINGO COPIANDO O VIDEO DO BALIAN
So nobody is going to mention the Mars yards he’s wearing? Noice
Wait are you from. New Zealand hahah
It's the friction from air pressure that cook it but If you were a real pro meat slapper you would get it up to 100c
Smack that all on the floor  Smack that give me some more  Smack that 'till you get sore
When you are bored in quarantine
Here that Fahrenheit, REAL science
*At a Fancy Restaurant* Waiter:  What will be your selection good sir?  Crustomer:  Yes, I'll go with your finest slapped steak dinner, medium slapped.
best thing youtube randomly recommended ever
Dude you're almost at a half a mill. Congrats 👏 Your hard work and dedication that you put into these chicken slapping videos most definitely paid off for you. Keep doing what your doing and inspire more intellect into the young community. Salute slappy.
Hold up you called it the meat beater?
wait if i slap my meat it will be cooked? yummy
Davie would be proud
The best kevin undeniably guard because peak biomechanically realise toward a fallacious frog. ill-informed, redundant specialist
Anyone else slap their chicken before cooking it?
F
Imagine that you've just been abducted by an alien race, on top of already murdering the fuck out if your family, they've decided to mutilate your body even more through slapping the shit out of you in order to cook you and to eat you, they sit down at the table and starts to munching away at your corpse, another peaceful day it is for them ay.
before: we will have flying cars in the future now: slapping chicken to cook
Erin: that's not vegan...
Davie504 supports this video
Third World Countries *Rarely, if ever, sees an oven*   First World Countries *Cooks food with slapping machines*
If you really want to use a real science temperature scale, you should use kelvin
2:46 what music is even playing in the background lol
Youtube algorithm strikes again
Here comes the dirty comments
911 yes he's a mad genius yes it's delicious
This would be the perfect machine for cube steak which you have to beat with a hammer to make it edible. This would tenderize while cooking. Tremendous. This is incredible, chief.
9:27 JD na czacie xD
3:33 “69420” I UNDERSTOOD THAT REFERENCE
Are of Polish origin?
Thank you, Youtube algorithm for showing this to me.
That gives beat the meat a whole new meaning
Did you call it "salmon ella"? Just because it's spelled like salmon the first 6 letters does not mean you pronounce salmonella "sāmōnêlā"...
Absolute legend
I don't know how I got here... But now I've watch the whole thing and would properly do it again :/
does it grip winky face
“...The original meat beater...”
*This completely redefines beating your meat*
Or you could just ask Vasily Kamotsky to slap that chicken once for you and that would be it.
"original meatbeater" lol
Here for the “beating the meat” jokes.
He switched the bag when he walked out
Sir sir sir
Unus Annus is proud
Prefiro o Balian
That wasn't a chicken. I watched the last video and by swapping to a steak has not satisfied me. Slap a fuckin chicken till it's cooked!
Imagine you're mom slap you're a$$ so fast

9:21 xD JD
this man is like if mark rober was a teenager
... Celsius isn’t the “science unit”...     It’s kelvin
he called it a meat-beater
get a inline 4 engine and fuel only the 1st and last cylinder. use the two middle pistons to beat the meat. since the cylinders are enclosed you will have very little heat loss. Don't forget the lubrication since no oil will be fed to the middle pistons. You can use cooking oil instead. You can track the RPM to get the number of "slaps" per minute. Since there is less rotational weight you will have a much faster slap rate and cooking time should be decreased greatly.
people can really be creative
Hello guys. I come from Your Daily Dose of Internet
Eating a steak with plastic fork and knife 😤
Great video Louis, glad to see you see some success. You deserve it.
You should open a restaurant with for slapped beef and chicken. It'd be an instant hit..
1:04
Davie504 would be proud
Portable ass-slapper
This shit slaps!
This video kept getting recommended and well I thought let’s freaking go !
gee why not call my mum
You can eat steak raw so. You should have stuck to chicken
Chicken Lives Matter.
Now can you cook the chicken by choking it?
I like how certified accounts can just post some trash comment and get a ton of likes anyway
It would be cool if you put a meat pulverizor onto the end of the rod. you could also try a oval sprocked to allow it to hit hard but it allows the period when the hammer is going up to be able to use less energy on the way up.
It is real science but it's wacky science, or humorous science
9:21 Jebać disa Jebać disa Jebać disa :D   Polacy są wszędzie.
9:20 gdy akurat randomowo na czat spojrzalem
Big deal, I cooked my ham years ago..........by slapping it as well
Looks a little over slapped for my liking
He did it. I can't believe that crazy dastard actually did it.
I think it has become way too easy to ignore just how demented this is.
and people said quarantine was BAD
now to cook a wagyu
Unus annus would be so proud
A guy cooking a chicken with slaps  6 Million people: interesting
Mans just learned hamon through cooking chicken
3:35 Heee funny monke number
fun fact: I clean my teeths the same way ancient roman soldiers used to do it.     And no, i don't feel gross by doing it every morning.
None of that is even close to cooked straight raw🤮🤮
Louis Weisz: and they called me a madman
imagine beating your meat with that mechine
“Look Buddy, I’m an Engineer...”
I learned so much about how to slap a chicken.
Plz use farhenheit
OK I know that song doesn't belong to Mark Rober, but hearing it outside of one of his videos is... unsettling... cool video though!
You finally did it 👏👏👏
How you gonna cook a steak with no seasoning 😂
Mark who was looking for ideas for unus annus: *interesting.*
If I spanked my but to many times...      Would it cook?
Coding is so beautiful
Slapping someone's ass 135.000 times will make it cooked ass 🤣
He did what Unus Annus could never do. Memnto mori never forget
That chimcken tender
Ethan (unus) and Mark (annus) would be proud.  Memento mori
It might be science, but it's also cooking. Imperial Fahrenheit is just fine. A chicken is done at 165 F. Try converting that to Celsius instantaneously with no paper and only in your head, I'll wait until you just own yourself and use the measuring system you're familiar with, not the one that assholes on the internet insist you use.
"That it would beat the life out of it."  You're just beating a dead cow at this point.
You did not think that the steak suffered enough? You had to use plastic knife and fork? Lol 😅
would someone cook their meat if they beat it too much 🤔🧐
Go to the moon pls!
my mans builds a whole meat slapped but is using plasticware
I'm glad I was part of this
I feel like if Leo Valdez had a yt account (and maybe not sooo much adhd) this would be it😂😂
“It smells like steak, it looks like steak”  IT IS STEAK.

You could have just asked Davie504 to do it but ok...
W ad😂
Fahrenheit > Celcius
wow he's really beating his meat
W ad😂
you fucking madlad you actually did it
Man YouTube 3am recommendation is really wierd
Man eats raw steak after failing to cook chicken with slaps
No, you didn’t do it. CLICK BAITTTTTT
You are literly Mark Rober from wish you use the same song 2
This really hit suggested DIDNT it, Guess everyone else wants to watch a chicken get harassed
Mr bro: am I a joke to you?
Amazing vidéo!! 😂 BTW you don't say F for Fahrenheit and you don't say C for Celsius ahah
but why is the chicken starting at about 30°C? did he JUST kill it before he started slapping it?
Mark Rober who?
11:55 jebać disa
I'm not so sure about the temperature in this situation. I believe all of the bacteria was either dead or left from the chicken way before 69420 slaps. I mean, it took 5000 slaps for my mother to leave me and my brother to live alone in the streets, and I'll tell you one thing, she was hard as fuck!
Now calculate how any chickens you could have cooked with all that wasted energy
6.1 mil people: hmm interesting
Not saying your lying but going into the bathroom to dump the juice out was the worst thing you could do for people who don’t believe lol
1:27 I had to pause it cause I was laughing so hard
1:05  "The original meat beater"
You did what unus annus failed to do
The chicken's ghost looking at it's corpse and going: They cut my head off for this sh*t?
Chicken so good, make you want to slap yo mama!
Just eating a  chicken but this... idk bro
Better stop slapping my girl's ass then
Can’t help but feel he cheated a little, swapping the chicken for something you can eat rare...🤷🏻‍♂️ I want to see a cooked chicken
What you didn't use freedom units to measure the temperature?
I hope people aren’t this dumb by realizing it’s going to room temperature or in this case heated mostly by the sun
h o t
Shamelessly steeling one the most popular engineers youtuber's background music making people interested in these kinds of videos unconsiously associate your video with the best in the game
Hey mom can I watch Mark Rober? Mom: We have Mark Rober at home. Mark Rober at home:
I’m glad this question has been answered. I still wouldn’t eat this though.
Did you try swaffling it?
...have steak will slap...
How has no one called Davie504? This is the only way to cook.
He freaking did it.

“Meat beater 9000” - phrasing....
@therussianbadger
meatbeater
Is this the 2020's version of Beakman's World?
Russian badger video "if kinetic energy can be transferred into thermal energy how hard do I need to punch a chicken to cook it"
Wow he knows how to get it right
Since the steak had a texture like it had already been chewed, you could market your meat beater to the geriatric population. They’d probably love it.
Whats that in actual normal human degrees
Ancient times: eating of raw meat Present day's: cooking on fire Future: SLAP IT!!!
"How hard do i have to hit a chicken to cook it? -HeavenlyFather
Waste of time.
Sometimes I like humanity 😌
boy gonna get sal vanilla
Me to my meat
pov: this is the first time youve seen one of his videos
How did I get here? Why am I watching this? I need chicken now.
I'm watching this while eating chicken. I now want to compare how it tastes.....  I'm weird I know 😂😂😂
This video is a waste of life and energy.
Someone please send this to the Russian badger, he and his friends talked about how hard they would need to smack a frozen chicken to cook it
What if you put a plate on top of the meat then the heat is transferred to the meat without beating the meat?
I know how to fix your problem slap it in the oven
Since I turned 13 I have cooked myself about 12,754 times.
Came here because of Daily Dose of Internet I just had to see this for myself
Did you season the meat at least?
This could be the birth of KSP.         Kentucky Slapped Chicken
This brings the phrase “beating my meat” to a whole new level
This feels like a Mark Robber Video
Finally
markiplier is proud of you
This was great up until I heard the mouth open chewing and I had to stop
Pivot PIVOT PIVAAAAAAT🤣🤣
Ah yes. The logical intersection of misoginy and cannibalism
Ah... so you saw Unus Annus....
am i allowed to say that the actual unit of temporal measurement in science is Kelvin- (though not suggested to be used considering its not a common thing)
Finally.....  The prophecy has been fulfilled
Slap like
forced to hit the chicken harder and harder, lmao c'mon bruh.
why
Would like to see the temperature in Kelvin instead of Celsius or Fahrenheit lmao
about 10 minutes in and it’s just occurred to me he’s cooking things by slapping it.
Pffffff... There is now way cooking with Hello Fresh is as fun as slapping your meat.
I am learning about heat and learning a new way to prepare food for thanksgiving.
OMG WE FOUND SAM.  haven't seen him in any of Peter's vids for a little while
The moment we all been waiting for.
So ima go slap a Turkey during Thanksgiving just is gonna take some time so I will start tomorrow!

This might be the first truly slap cooked meat, but the Mongolian horseback riders did something very similar long time ago....
When i beat my meat, I am a bit more primitive i must say.
Meatbeater 9000 😂😂😂😂😂😂

To cook it in one slap you would need to hit it with the velocity of 3725.95 mph which is humanly impossible and we can't hit it with an SR-71 blackbird without wiping it from existence so... But now you've made *possible* but at what cost.
this why is slapping is viable sport
Now do this with spaghetti and embrace the somebody toucha ma spaghett horror game
Yo, was your thing inspired but therussianbadger
A new way to cook, once I grow up I will definitely try this out.
Ok this is awesome
This man really just told HPC his suggestion was bad, oof
One time I slapped my grandma and she got sick. I asked how do u feel? She said medium well.
F
Dude looks like Gordon Ramsey's weird cousin.
basically I can carry raw chicken around and as long as I can slap at light speed I can have freshly cooked chicken anywhere
clicked on the video cause it seems funny. then i realized your a broke Mark Rober. Decided to ignore the lack of creative music choice but had to stop because the music is just way to loud in the background. maybe like -4 decibles and you would be good but im actively trying to listen past the music to your voice. not enjoyable man. best of luck you you and your poultry affairs!
Funny to see HPC commenting on other vids lol
Wow the evolution of the meat beater is inspiring
Dude imagine louis, joel, mark Rober and michael reeves did a project together
Use it on you Girl Friend
What about a steam powered slapper?!
Has someone told RussianBadger about this?

I'll take one meat beater, please. For cooking. Yes, cooking.

Michael Reeves..?
YOU CHEATED!!!, that's starting at the half-way point. -You didn't slap cooked the steak. -You slap cooked a half-cooked sous vide steak. That's cheating. -100% slap cooked steak would of taste better, (Probably not, but you got the point)
all the electricity wasted on moving the arms coulda been used to cook so many chickens
You should have named it the poultry pounder

Why do I have this in my recommended list ?
This is what millions of years of evolution has brought us to. Perfection.
personally, if you compare the initial size of the bag of steak it was the size of his palm just about, this steak at the end is about the size of his whole hand so to me it looks rather fake plus there are time skips so he could have had it ready for when he went to another room and came back
1:36 what song is that
Anyone else think of a quote from a song from avenue q "beat that meat for a special treat."

Lol this guy is using his skills and time to make a slapping chicken cooking machine, this guy is unique lol
This idiot is patting the chicken... Sorry to be a huge nerd, but more friction = more heat.   Have a slap be drawn out and slide on the chicken a little, and use material that has high surface area.  I facepalmed myself and nearly cooked my nose....

9:20 Jd nie tylko w Polsce XD
Important! Must read!  Its not the bacteria that kill you, its bacteria poo. It is vital (literally) that you restrict the time that food is between 5 and 50 centigrade, typically a total of 1 1/2 hours. it is during this time that the bacteria breed and poo. Heating to over 75 (or 55 for a long time) will kill bacteria but do nothing to the already toxic level of bacteria poo.
WhT is the name of the song that starts at 4:20?

I couldn’t stop laughing the entire video. As an engineer I have no choice but to tip my hat to this.
So like, I know the video you mentioned this was like 11 months ago, but what the hell happened to “Sean the impaler” cause what he did seemed pretty damn psychotic to me
Felt like a mark rober video.
So this is how bachelors cook their meals nowadays.
Takes beating your meat to a whole new level
That chicken still looked alive. The steak. Idk man, you took it through that door without showing the camera first.

Do you know this "for how long do you need to yell at a cup of coffee in order to heat it up"?  Now make a machine that yells concentrated praise/curses at a piece of chicken until edible. Compare flavors to decide on the better recipe.
MeatBeater 9000. Yes please.

Hello fresh: "we like how you beat your meat, here's a sponsorship"

d a i l y d o s e o f i n t e r n e t
I hope no vegans are watching this...
Why a single pivoting arm, which is extremely inefficient, instead of a paddled rotor which turns in a single direction? Or, adding a crank shaft and using multiple pivoting arms? Either way would conserve a lot more energy, which would have been better used being transferred to the chicken via kinetic energy? You are losing insane amounts of energy through friction, needlessly. Either way, impressive, but honestly leaves me scratching my head as to why. A simple design change would have negated the necessity for a second motor.
"meat beater"
My dude gave beating your meat a whole new meaning
Good thing I only slapped myself 134.999 times
How could chicken become steak :/
I can't believe I'm watching some dude slap a chicken to cook it 3 in the morning
"meat beater"
The animal dies* watches what happened to its body and then sees that his ass got clapped over 100tousands times.
Now we need to know if you can cook the chicken in one slap without vaporizing it.
He is legit beating his meat
All that engineering and slapping that poor chicken carcass, only for a Hello fresh sponsor ad? Totally worth it 😉👌
9:21 jebać disa nasi tu byli
So you have beaten your Meat for over an Hour straight... Impressive.
Those are some sweet nikes, bro.

HelloFresh Ad 😂
9:21 Jebać disa XD
You could’ve just told tony Lopez that the chicken was a child. It would be cooked in about 5 mins
Imagine dying as a chicken just so some guy can slap your body over and over to achieve something he could do with a microwave.
They've made the ultimate spank-inator
Not only are you now a master engineering slapper chef, you're a linguistic genius because you've given the phrase "beating one's meat" a real double meaning! You're a true blessing from God, for we brethren shall sing Auld Lang Syne of this day! Peace be on Earth and good will to all men!🤝🙏😂😂😂   Edit: Nearly forgot to thank Daily Dose Of Internet for sending me here. Thank you, DDOI!🙏✌
This guy is exactly like Mark Rober same music and everything.
That isn't smacking a chicken, that is beating it with a cutting board. . .
Just why

This puts a whole new meaning to beating your meat
I am gonna build a meat clapper so it cooks twice as fast
this guy Has expensive crazy metalic tools everywhere.. but only a plastic fork??? LooL
Cool idea to slap-cook your meat. Another way to do this could be with a rotating wheel with eight rubber flaps attached to it. That would slap your meat eight times per spin. At the same rpm you are now using to drive the arm, i think you can raise a higher temperature in shorter time since the meat gets less time to cool down.
1:05 hehe meat beater       Im a perv
And this is exactly why microwaves were created.  Noone gonna slap chicken to cook it.
Steam or chicken?
Why does this video remind me of a Mark Rober video?
I'm so proud of this man.

Now do it in one slap
It definitely seems that the channel you cut into the slapping arm which attaches to the pin caused the most issues, due to the pin applying force to the thin walls at the top and the bottom of the channel. A design resembling a piston would have mitigated this, where, instead of a pin moving back and forth inside a channel, you have a smaller channel moving back and forth inside of a larger channel, which would be the arm. The smaller channel would be pinned to the wheel.  Also, even though it ended up working in the end when you used a stronger bolt, the bolt ideally should have been supported at both ends rather than just one, so that it resembles a crankshaft. In addition, the slapping arm is offset from the wheel by a significant amount, increasing the torque and subsequently the bending stress. And this bending stress is dynamic, meaning that it's basically just a matter of time before the bolt breaks due to fatigue. If you set it up like a crankshaft, you would not only reduce the internal stresses in the bolt but you would also be able to drive the crankshaft with a belt/chain rather than a rigid attachment to the motor shaft. This would let you gear up, and you could also put on a flywheel to smooth out the torque the motor outputs. It would also eliminate any axial forces or lateral torque acting on the motor, which motors really aren't meant to deal with.
Why...? Why do I have this in my recommended list? Just... Why?
So you just take Mark Rober music.
Tell me you have too much time without telling me you have too much time HAHAHA
I respect his scientific knowledge and Love his scientific skills. And love how he is trying to be like Mark Rober. And he is funny. ThTs all I got to say

Feels like a bit of cheating by giving yourself a head start with the sous vide. Good effort though...
Cooled pog
Why waste more chicken when you already have proven that you are able to slap cook beef steaks?
Real ones only use a microwave to cook chicken
Don't wanna be a hater dude, interesting concept & video, but you should be MUCH clearer to the younger audience about the importance of cooking chicken!
Or you could ya know... cook it in an oven
This is so fucked up xD
bruh that is the ultimate meat beater
maybe if you put chicken under a drummer's practice pad.....
Imagine being a chicken and when you die you get slapped
Gordon Ramsey: ITS FUCKING BLAND
Yo you are like only 30 minutes away from me I wish I could witness these experiments in person

Nice mark ruber background music
I like how I got this video after watch daily dose of internet recent video

Two guys slapping meat... there's no limit to folly.
This man is slow cooking with a fcking slab machine

Nah whenever I get a bad piece of steak all Im gonna do now is say "tastes like you slapped it 30000 times
I showed this to my mom and she thinks you will be a serial killer

Well..obviously I have to click on this.
Davie504 is typing...
This was insane
This man literally spent days in a garage beating his meat. Absolute legend.
Mans got the drip
Congrats brother, I feel proud for you❤... It's history mark my words!
Is this because of the fufu challenge?
Chiken : what is the goal of my life ?  G O A L :
After hearing "slap" and "slapping" I just had to stop the video and watch some other video from Davie504.
No fucking way this guy exists
So that's why my gf ass cheeks became tanned...
Did you tell HelloFresh what this video was about before they sponsored it? 😆
Someone said in the comments your a commie
jd na czacie to sie rozumie 😎
For the next video will you choke your chicken?
11:55 JDJDJDJDJDJDJDJDJDJD
so to translate this to a cat..............in theory you could slap your cat to cooked perfection. But at what temp is a kitty considered cooked? This is the next test we must do and investigate in the name of science!
The madman did it, he really did it..
yoo this slaps
You should open up a restaurant
greetings fellow human scrolling through the recent comments
Just wait till Ramsay tries the same thing
He should have ask Davie 504 for help
*THATS WHAT SHE SAID!!!!!!*
XD
Customer sends back their food because its too cold. Their getting these hands
As a person that lives in a country that uses celsius, it bothers me he just says "c" but says "fahrenheit" everytime
So I'm gonna assume 8 c° is 8 Fahrenheit
i cannot be the only who clicked because of unus annus

you do know what the difference is between messing around and 'Real' science, yes?
I know how its cooked before i watched this First: the slapping is so fast it creates heat from it and when its slapping for about 5 - 10 min its prob done but its getting heat from how fast its being slapped (chicken slap new meme)
so you are mark rober... buts memes??
This dude beat his meat more than my entire time in quarantine in just a few minutes
Gordon Ramsey:  *”ITS FUCKING RAW YOU DONKEY”*
Lol you dont know how happy i am seeing this in my reccomandations months after i saw the first part
But why
Soo... since we are talking about energy in the form of heat, what about the energy efficiency of your slap machine?

I just wached this vid from daily dose of internet
This deserves way more views than it has
meat beater...
A lot of meat beating.
He’s just taken slow cooking to a whole new level
The device is too complicated. More parts means more things to fail. Should have just stuck to the spinning wheel with like 12 ballistic gel hands mounted on flexible shafts to it so they will bend back to clear the chicken. Increasing speed would allow the hands to hit more often, without increasing force too much. Having the arms mounted in a sort of trailing configuration, as opposed to coming out 90 degrees to the wheel, should also decrease the slapping force and make it easier for the hands to clear the chicken after making contact.
Meat beater.
Last vid was on reccomended so was this one
Daily dose of internet!
The fact he found a way not to puree it has me mind blown
Why did I buy an oven then !?
Its insane how all this started from a single Reddit post.
This absolute mad man actually did it.

This guy is going places for sure loved this series the meat that was finally beat.
0:14 in the back there is a mini moterhome (forgive my spelling) MY MOM HAS THEE EXACT SAME ONE
finally i have found the answer to everything :  slapping chicken to cook it
Congrats you just add another useless effect for humanity . A chicken needs 135 thousands slaps to be cooked
Why was this reccomended to me- I'm actually so confused but its interesting so I'll watch it.
The original meat beater sounds like an A+ movie
unus annus would be proud
i was here
Now to bring out the meat beater for thanksgiving
who in the hell disliked this
Meat beater
YouTube, you know me so well
"what's all the noise? what are you doing in there?" "cooking chicken"  Though it seems like you cooked everything else first.
is that Peter Sripol in the video?
I feel like your talents could be used to tackle some actual problems. Quit wasting chickens, maybe help someone.
U can say he literally beat meat
JEBAĆ DISA XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD 9:19
Congratulations on click-baiting me twice.
fake
Try to throw the chicken from a height that it falls to 1.665 m/s Or something that will hit him at that speed, which works right the first time
Now do it manualy
I got roasted by my GF for slapping her . Lesson learned: use on chickens, not on chicks.
Normal pepole: Cooks chicken. Smart pepole: Uses alot of money to make a chicken slapper.
I was gonna sub but he has 420k
tf is this
Yo by any chance idk if someone has brought this up but you should tag Gordon Ramsey in a tiktok so he can duet it and just be like let me teach y’all how to cook a perfect medium rare steak or chicken just to have him watch you slap the hell out of it 😭😭😭

WOW, quarantine has gotten me somewhere REALLY wierd
Finally!
Imagine the 69420 th slap made the chicken go from 68° C to 69° C
You are going to get sick 🤢

Yes yes I had a dream that one day little black boys and little white girls could slap a chicken to perfection

What would Gordon Ramsay say...
As a food handler , chicken must reach 165 degrees fahrenheit.
Love me some slap vide chicken.

I can attest to Hello Fresh, in case anyone is wondering. It’s really easy, and all I have to do is get the food and the recipe card out, and follow along. Throw in some tunes or your favorite livestream and cooking is fun! I've been cooking dinner every other night in my mom's place for 7 months, and we've been doing Hello Fresh for pretty much all of it. It's been great! Everyone loves the meals! Sorry I don't mean to sound like an ad, I just felt like gushing about being able to cook really good meals! It's so great!!!!

Imagine you put a human head under that.
According to serve safe standards here in the US chicken has to be cooked to a bare minimum of 145deg F.   So nah you didn't cook it.
You broke a bolt but at least you didn't bust a nut!
I was wanting to see you eat the chicken :(

"The reason we cook our meat is to kill whatever bacteria it contains." Yes, because raw meat is just wonderfully delicious and not tough as all hell.

He really beat the meat.
Plot twist. When he went to pour the juice out he swapped it for a stove cooked steak.
This guy can unironically say that he beats his meats.
Poor Chicken died to get slapped 100,000 times and be thrown away, rip Chicken o7
*WHAT IS THE SYNTH MONTAGE SONG CALLED PLEASE*
So proud of you. You should teach science with Bill Nye.
Congratulations 👏🏼you worked hard and now you made it
the fact its called the "meat beater" is hilarious.
So is this how cavemen prepared their food before discovering fire
such a slapping video
Yep, I'm down the Youtube hole...
With a little improvement this is how we will cook in the future,but of course you did all the work
People in 1930: they will probably have flying vieclse in the future.  Meanwhile people in 2021: slapping chicken til it's cooked
It’s still bleeding😳

LMAO HE EVEN HAS THE MARK ROBER MUSIC IN THE BACKGROUND
I can't believe you used motors to Beat your Meat for 13 minutes.
Does that mean I can actually eat ass if I use a slapper machine on it
Why is YouTube giving money to this shit, stupid content... How do people believe in this bumb stuff?!? Go read a book. How is there hope in future if something like this exists...
he- he didn't season it now it's just going to taste like bland slapped arse
how much did it cost this bullshit? such a waste a time, my time I mean...
Need mark rober to make a video with this man
This ladies and gentlemen, is what we are now reduced to inventing.. because everything else already exists.

Use a live chicken for extra body heat, thank me later😏
*Business idea* : A restaurant where the food is cooked via slaps and the customers can watch. It would be a cool attraction in a tourist town.
I saw a video that's  a cursed discord comments having someone saying "how hard do i have to slap this chicken to cook it" or something i dunno

The source of Canola oil, rapeseed oil, was an industrial lubricant well before it was a cooking ingredient. Not silly at all to lubricate a machine with it, it's perfectly functional.

well well well, if it isn't YoutTube recommendation FINALLY showing me something interesting, anyways subbed :D
I mean real science would use kelvin but yeah freedom units are dumb

So this is how davie504 cooks his chicken
unus annus moment
Why does it feel like I'm watching a mark Rober video
people usually say, this chicken slaps  *they didnt mean this chicken was slapped*
You cooked a chicken by SLAPPING? A certain bassist is interested in a cooperation.
hello fresh is bad, they send out of date ingredients or almost out of date ingredients, the onions were soaking wet, recipes are shitty and they don't refund you, they just say hey. take this money to buy more shit from us
What the fuck? Why? Why would you waste this much time on something this dumb?
Accidently cooked her butt
Guys he's back!
Why don't you try multiple slapping arms on a fly wheel attached to the motor. If the slapping medium was just flexible enough, it can apply enough force to produce heat and with multiple slapping arms on the wheel, you can crank it and get more slaps per sec. Also, this requires much less stress on the slapping arms because the force applied to each arm on impact would dissipate slightly (i think) as the arm makes its way back around the wheel rather than applying force over a longer arm which creates weak points and instability. So, shorter arms, something flexible enough to slap and also bend enough to move past the chicken and with multiple arms, maybe 6, depending on diameter of the wheel, you get more power and with shorter arms you don't lose as much energy before the slap is applied. Think windmill with slapping arms cranked up to 1000rpm.
Can you cook a meat by stroking it?
*Meat beater 9000*
Chicken though RIP
How do you want your steak, grilled or slapped?
Aerogel to cook chicken?      Someone send this video to Veritasium
Nice.
Baby chicken: what happens when we die  Dad chicken: not now son.
I imagine that this would be the type of meal Davie504 would enjoy.
This is an evolved Mark Rober invention
Maybe  a 🐟 would be easier to cook
Oh man I watched the original video a couple of months ago, and now here we are witnessing history.
Can you cook meat by slapping it tho 😏
Just when I thought youtube couldn't recommend me anything more random, I get this.....😭😭

It’s not the floating cars we expected 50 years ago, but I think this is just as extraordinary. Nobody expected this.

Nobody: Absolutely nobody: Davie 504 joins the chat.
Now u have to eat a week on slap cooked foods only
Why don't u just cook the chicken
Unus annus would be proud.
Talk about beating your meat and eating it too.
Did this fucking guy just say that hello fresh was sustainable? LOL
Bro I saw you from the news in our country Bulgaria 😂
next up: how hard do i have to fart to actually fly?
.                                                                                                                                  .
Why not just include Both degrees ?
I feel like I'm watching the all gas no brakes of engineering.  Give this man an oversized lab coat.
I'm at the weird side of YouTube again
You did it, you crazy son a b****, you did it
History in the making
I would love to be that chicken🥴
Dont you use Kelvin for most of real science?
Meat beater
Mark Rober copy
“Mommy, Daddy can I make a meat beater for the science fair 🥺”
So he finally perfected the 'meat beater' LOL...can't wait to see it's commercial production.
If pshisical energy can be turned into therman energy then how hard would i have to punch a chicken to cook it (a wise man)
5:56 Fog of war
To think it all happened from a big bang
If your ever gonna sell it you should probably change the name "meat beater"
Bro thats sick
Just watching this reminds me of my dads leather belt
9:21 "Je*ać disa" XD
if you beat your meat, will it cook?
Dam he really slap his chicken  😩 😬😬
It is said that rich people live in luxury, and so their solutions are based on their luxury problems. I'm homeless and haven't eaten steak since 2016.
Friend: so what have you been doing this past quarantine?   The uploader: uhh... I ran errands and stuff.  The errands:
It's perfect medium raw
Why did i only realize he was collabing with peter stripol half way through
*So if I slap my leg too many times I will cook it?...*
"Meat beater 9,000"
I need to go to bed, I first read "I choked my chicken by smacking it"
JAKA LEGENDA! DOSTAŁA JD NA JUTUBY! O KURWA!
Slapped that chicken cooked
"SLAPPED": An option to be added in restaurant cooking menus.  How would you like your chicken: Grilled, Fried or SLAPPED??
Show this to gordon ramsay
When you try to slap but it's all cooked
Salmonella For Sure!
Lol pretty similar aka he’s using MB9001 my initial is MB1212😆😆😆
This is what the internet was made for!  :D
im glad the great question has been answered in full. you CAN slap a chicken to cooked.
lowkey steals music from Mark Rober...lol
I feel bad for the chicken that died to be cooked like this
This is pretty damn cool lol
literally my upstairs neighbor ..
The long awaited sequel.
5:22 what version of CAD is this?
Imagine beating your mean with this🥲
Who needs chef club when you got Louis
My mom have slapped me more than that .
I was suposed to be learning but here i am watching a guy cook chicken by slaping it
why is he a offbrand mark rober  he uses same music and talks  like him
I guess the food is hand made..
The future of cooking
Gordon ramsey should see this😂😂😂😂
Ladies and Gentlemen, we have just witnessed Internet History being made. A higher Achievement than man discovering fire, or landing on the moon. Ten thousand years from now after we can definitively prove we are not alone in our universe and we have made repetitive contact with a race of beings outside of our solar system we will still look to this day as the greatest achievement of all mankind. And one day when all diplomacy has fallen and wars are abundant in this world the one thing that will bring us together is this. The single most revolutionary find in all of human existence is without a doubt percussive cooked poultry.
9:20 J*bać Disa
Wait... I recognise the background music           Mark rober
Heard my friend watching this and the Mark Rober music threw me off at first and thought that this months video was slapping a chicken or... beating his meat.
william you look different today
.
Neighboors: “are they making maintenance woks?” Me: “almost cooked😁:
Just have Davie504 give it slapp.
Honey, put the schicken in(?) the slapper, I come home in 1hour
I remember Unus Annus doing this with their hands but the channel is deleted now
do the paper boat again but put some supports in made of card board tubes
There was no way I could see that title and not click on the video...
Russian pro slapping tournament
Everyone: woah he finally did it whooo hoooo Me: Hey that Music is the same Mark Rober uses in his vids!
That's how your mom cooked MY chicken.
Where is Davie504
Louis be like: imma spank this chicken
I was click baited, hoping for chicken, ended with beef. Verdict: What an upgrade!
Wannabe mark rober
Meat beater
am I this bored?? I guess...
This is how they cooked chicken before they discovered fire
This made me subscribe

So he slap his meat 135k times?
My man made his invention look bad for the sponsor lol

As I kid I thought nobody slapped harder than my mom , boy was I wrong
Everything was perfect until i hear you took Mark soundtrack. Next time choose your own.
Could whipping be a more efficient way to cook a chicken? 🤔
He said meat beater 1:03
They said it cannot be done... The new Mark Rober has came...
Mom:What you watching? Me:A guy beating his meat then he eats it Mom:Oh oka-Wait what
This is Walmart Micheal Reeves
Imagine you being executed by this slapping machine ... Not hitting you hard but slowly cook you 😂
Today I watched a man slap a chicken to proper eating temp. Thanks YouTube.
9:21 pdk
Pepole in 2020: Yes I need this
You can connect at am bicycle and you never goona use electric power:)
Greaaaaat. Now I have another useless fact in my head. 135,000 slaps! Thanks.
- : "How you would want ur chicken done sir?" Davie504 : Slapped
Didn't know this was relevant to my interest, until it was.
He cooked it by *beating his meat* nope doesn't sound right
you should have seasoned the chickens
There is no way my kfc was cooked by someone slapping it.......is it possible to learn this power
Why do I feel like I am watching Mark Rober...
in 20th century: in 2021 we will have flying cars! 2021:
they said it could not be done...
"adjustable slap depth"
You sound like Marty Mcfly
When you looking for some slapforce cooked chicken and on chat in video you see "Jebać Dissa"  Poles are everywhere
Go team up with some Youtube cook(s) to see if they can devise a suitable recipe and usecase for the slapper. (Sortedfood maybe? They do silly stuff and they test gadgets, too!)
Microwaves? Meet macrowaves. ...or "meat macrowaves" to be precise.
team up with guga foods to make an actual good steak
9:21 jebac disa xddddd
I wonder if a pinwheel type slap device would have been better. Where several flappy paddles (rubber) would spin on a wheel and properly slap the chicken instead of just mashing it like you ended on.
Davie504's favourite method of cooking a chicken, *with B A S S*
When I saw him saying done at 60° I was very concerned for a second and then I remembered Celsius exists
This machine is perfect either for cooking a chicken or satisfying a really weird fetish
00:57 That Mark Rober music... you know some awesome science is coming.
9:21 "jebać disa" na czacie XD polska gurom
Gordon Ramsay locked himself in the freezer and then committed suicide by burning himself after seeing this.
It’s ok, this video is allowed to use Mark Robers music
hours . . . only up to 30c is in the danger zone. sure hours at 55c pasteurizes but there is a reason you dont cook spoiled chicken. Its like  cooking your chicken on the counter in the sun. Its not safe to cook a chicken in a greenhouse like box on your counter.
Now cook it with a single slap.
I got only one question : WHY a plastic fork?
Should've used vibranium smh
I would like my 11 minutes and 42 seconds back please...
I feel sorry for the chicken.
Where the hell is Davie504 ???
Alternate Title: "I beat my meat with a machine"
I’m all in. Great work guys.  Liked and subbed
135,000 slaps you say? Hmm...  *Looks at chicken aisle*   😈🤠
Saw the first vid. Shared it all over. Loved the work...but now..now? Now I will subscribe. You have earned my trust sempai.
Im disappointed that I didn't notice you were in peters shop until he was on can, what kind of fan am I? Otherwise congrats on moving to a shop more suited for creators!
PETER WAS THERE
Wait so you figured out how to cook a chicken with slaps yet you cant build something that contributes our society, like better solar panels or a fuel alternative? The US is a pit of wasted talent
Damn that thing slaps
“meat beater” *ah yes perfect thing to use while watching hent-*
WHO'S LAUGHING NOW, MARSHALL ERIKSEN?!
its a SIGN OF PROGRESS..
WHEN YOU COOK, NO ONE CAN BEAT YOUR MEAT!
This is the kind of crazy the world needs. Thank you for this fundamental research.  ...Maybe a new trend for molecular cuisine btw.
Really cool video! Proves you can do just about anything you set your mind to. Next time I suggest rubbing the chicken to cook it might be easier with more friction.
Is this applicable to boil water?
I'd Frick
i dont know Rick.... He went to a room a then ... you know the rest
1:05 meat beater
Ur kinda like mark rober but you build ‘not really useful’ machines (no offense)
You are mark rober 2
i really appreciate using Celsius to make the video more universal... but the occasional switching back and forth in which unit you talk about is still a bit confusing.
The age old question was cooking a chicken with one slap though. Useless experiment
Has science gone too far
i love this. I love this whole video so much. But, ffs, if I hear you saying "C" instead of Celsius, I'm going to blow my brains out
S c I e N C e
Put a baby un there
being this nerd about bird is almost absurd just swag it, bag it, shake it and bake it. ;-) will the upgrade be called theMasterBeater?
by contributing to hello fresh you are helping with the demise of food freedom, soon you will only be able to order food from bullshit companies like hello fresh..  absolute fucking garbage new world order type shit...
The chicken was probably fine with dying for this
Adds fake hand to arm.  Ultimate try not to bust challenge
Meat Beater: the meat cooker that cooks your meat, ruins it's texture and sounds like a sex toy.
fake     the chicken was a paid actor
Mark rober music
Why does the steak look like cow shit
Dude. Your designs slaps
I'm so proud of you
The ultimate spanking machine
He has taken the meaning *beating my meat* to a different level.
I wonder how Gordon Ramsey would feel about a meal made by the meat beater... anyway, congrats lol we're all very proud
We just witnessed history
Momento mori
Gordon Ramsay would be proud of you
You know its gonna be a good video whrn the mark rober music kicks in
This man knows what temp chicken should be more than anyone I've worked with. Subscribed.
no
I read choked...
You did It, you son of a bitk you did it
@Davie 504: approved
This dude changed the steak the moment he entered into the room

Am i the only one that noticed that he's wearing Mars Yard shoes? Aren't those like 5 thousand dollars?
Me:its too late i gotta go to sleep. YT: I cooked a chicken by slapping it  Me: mmm interesting
Louis Weisz: i cook a chicken by slapping it  Chicken: i am getting abused
@Davie504
Scientist: U gotta slap the chicken by this crazy amount to generate enough heat for you to cook it.  This guy: *_Reality can be whatever I want._*
The high-tech in slapping science.
No chicken 🐔 were harmed while making this video
It's the only one.......as far as you know
Wow  This guy really can beat his, Well I will let you finish the rest of the sentence. 😏
I bet your neighbors love you
he looks like jake paul but smarter :) 3:44
Her: hes probably cheating on me with other girls. Me and the boys at 3 am:
music https://youtu.be/nBOR97ZktJY
He did actually it, Godspeed.
Watching you cut that steak with a plastic knife really hurt my heart 💔
U should make a video with Mark robber please
Damn man. He did it
Has anyone noticed Mark Rober‘s montage song in the background? No? Just me? Ok.
Idk who this unnis annus is
Dude smell the steak  Oh yess its smell like steak.
“Beating my meat” just got a whole different meaning
Stupid excuse to not eat it
I get Mark Rober vibes. I like it
Cool video but god your personality is so unapologetically bland and  annoying
Works with the wife to
This guy took 'beating the meat' way too seriously.
I saw the video in which you said it's not possible because the chicken is falling apart before it's cooked
Now shoot one up the sky and let friction cook it like Apollo 13
11:15 JD
You’re making history and we’re all here for it!!
МАКСИМАЛОЧКА
The madlad actually did it
They called him a madman.
*Mark Rober music plays in background*
This is a genius
Unas Annus would be proud
What the fuck.
Her: he's probably off clapping some other bitch's cheeks Him:
First you gotta choke that chicken THEN you gotta slap it.
Next you should try cooking steak with vibration
Only hearing the Mark Rober bg music
Need a colab with Guga Foods.
Remember chickens and a cow gave their lifes for science!
Meat beater lol
Ok now cook a chicken by slapping it with a chicken
"Original Meat Beater"🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Starving children in Africa could have eaten those slaps.
Ladies and gentleman he did, HE DID IT
11:56 chat 👏👏
This is the young Mark Rober
Imagine beeing born a chicken just to get slapped a million times
This guy must be the twin of micheal reeves but still uploading
besides a chicken slapper, this would also work as a neck slapper, just imagine this baby fully cooking your neck.
This dude is like french mark  :) love it
"guns save lives" lol deslike
Don't ever let me see you cut steak with a plastic butter knife bruh....🤦🏾‍♂️
Meat Beater 9001 for some people : *Head Crusher 9001*
be better if the chicken was alive.
69 420  lets go 😂
When your dad gets sick of beating your sister with his hands...... I do hope this ain't for sale
pmsl when peter cameo'd about the broken variac i lost it then realised where you were filming. This project has been such an insane saga XD
Him: *spanks meat*
Him at 9:48 That is a steak!!! Me: That is disgusting
Noice
Thats the most uncanny name for a machine like that
This dude is Dr. Stone with a netflix adaption.
How bold of Hello Fresh to sponsor this.
Learn how to say aluminum for shit sake.
Not meant bad but this is like a wanna be Mark Rober
This made me so happy :')
The first man to ever eat unseasoned steak 😒
You should do a collaboration with YouTuber Wintergatan ,  May the Force, of a slap be with you.

I’m so happy I heard this “meat beater” 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
It's a very strange century when the clowns are scientists (having their own workshop and resources just to make jokes) and the scientists are treated like clowns (climate change denial)...
Needs more overreacting
why doe

Should have called it “Pasteurising a chicken with slaps”
This man is asking something that we didn't ask. And he solved it. What a legend.
Im glad u made something to slap ur meat ._.
Im thinking different on that hand slapping the chicken😂
The kid who took beating meat too serious:
My mans really went for the mark rober music
Pewdiepie forever
9:21 - jebać disa na czacie hahahahahahahahahahahahahahh
I'd love this guy to make a commercial "Experience the luxury of beaten meat"
The 7.7K dislikes : this is offensive
Please do not eat meat that hasn’t reached at least 70°C at its core P.S. Ok he got me, time/temperature combinations are infinite. Good work!
Bro this is mark rober 2.0
This reminds me on a Mark Rober video. (ik the music is the same)
YEESSSSS FINALY
Slap a chiken like now
9:20 Polish user: jebac disa jebac disa jebac disa jebac disa jebac disa jebac disa jebac disa jebac disa
The question is how hard you would have to slap the chicken 1 time to cook it, not how many slaps it would take.
WTF is going on with americans eating their food on disposable dishes and with plastic forks and knives?
Seeing this video made me hungry🥩
“And how would you like you steak tonight sir?” “Medium rare, slapped.”
This is the biggest non efficient energy transfer of all time xD But it was funny to watch! nice achievement :D
I can imagine a universe where fire wasn't invented and humans just slap their meat to cook it.
Brilliant
I Like Ya Cut G *Continues to smack it thousands of times*

I wanted to see cooking chicken with slapping but I saw jebać disa instead.
I can die now in peace
This guy...... Motivate me....
It's basically "I'm gonna beat my meat" but it's literal
This guy made so many mistakes and never give up. Anyone of average mentality would have gave up or would have never begin with this in the first place thinking it's a silly stupid idea. This man is a genius and brave too. Curious men like this are way ahead of time.
11:54 JEBAC DISA XDDDDDD 🇵🇱🇵🇱🇵🇱🇵🇱🇵🇱🇵🇱
It is called the meat beater?
9:45 this looks like a goddamn cow poop made of chicken
HE'S GOT A RICE COOKER!
Nobody: Chat on 9:20  Jebać disa
Seasoning!!!!!!!!!!! Why didn't you  season any of it😢😭😭😭
Why not have the slapper hit a metal plate to heat it up to indirectly cook the chicken.
Before humans discovered how to light a fire, kids were particularly scared of their moms.
for this rason I pay internet
“If physical energy could be turned into thermal energy, how hard would I have to punch a chicken to cook it?”
imagine if him failing (which is impossible)
Chimckem
This man is on the next level
My grandpa told me this is how they used to cook chicken
Who's here after seeing the meme?
How does one acquire, the amazing Meat Beater?      For cooking purposes of course.
Shit slaps bro
500,000 years ago, Homo erectus used fire to cook meat in minutes, in 2021,  a Homo sapien spent 2 months to build a fully automated slapper to cook meat in 8 hours. We are evolving, just backwards. This is sick btw

This is the dumbest smart shit I've ever seen. Subscribed.
Where's Penguinz0?
mark and ethan would be proud
Where @Davie504 at?
dude idk how there is so many failed attempts at just slapping a chicken. it seems like an extremely simple task that is seemingly impossible.
This is a vegans worst nightmare.
I feel so sorry for those chickens. not rly FOR SCIENCE!
This video SLAPS!! Show this to Davie504
You just invented the macrowave.
I subbed and liked before the video even started, anyone who can best some meat like that, is definitely a friend of mine... Wink Wink
11:55 Jebac disa XDDD
Vegans: bruhhhhh
He beat chicken so much it became beef steak
I have just realized he’s a big fan of PewDiePie
*slaps top of chicken* salesman: This baby can take so many kinetic energy before being complete cooked
Finally! Congratulations!!!
Dude. You have no respect for nature. Imagine if it was a human corpse in there instead of a chicken. Thats how disgusting this experiment is to me and most people I know who has seen the thumbnail.
Me cooking for first time:
I watched the old video, and now I feel happy
I'm imagining companies will start using this tactic for cooking chicken
This should be taught to children!
He beat his meat until it burned and he ate it so cool
XD
I love how all YouTubers know each other some way or another
Mans beating his meat
I can see the future using this to cook.
How would you like your steak, sir?  Slapped, please.
Finally, mankind is going in the right direction
What a time to be alive.
The madlad actually did it. You just gained another subscriber keep up with the quality content.
I love how he didn't give up no matter what happened :)
Louis has *definitely* got my nomination...     ...to the meat-beaters hall of fame...
Don't dhow this Gordon Ramsey
All ok, but when they stopped the slapper for oiling or whatever reason, the temprature didn't fall 😒
He's talking like we understand every word he's saying.
Reddit gang where you at???
cant wait to see this in my future grandson's history book
First world privileges.
mark rober? love your vids
Shiiiiii the mark rober music tho
*Chicken got Slapped*
Should have made spares too, just 1 piece isn't good idea.
Why'd you change the thumbnail tho?
Wouldn't be surprised if in the future some weird ass space station/ space ship is going to force it's astronauts to eat this because its somehow cheaper to produce than a normal chicken/ steak
Someone needs to get a real fucking job instead of doing stupid shit

people in 1990's : there will be cars flying around in 2021. people in 2021 : cooking chicken by slapping it.
I feel like your @Liam Thompson just with tools
Despite it being moderately Skynet that YouTube/Google/etc knows that “how many slaps would it take to cook a chicken” is one of my favorite pins of all time, (this just popped up randomly in my recommended video thing, don’t take that skynet bit too seriously, k?) I love that this actually happened somehow. This should be lovely for my Brainiac (science abuse) withdrawal. Me subbed.
What Gru actually say's: How many human slaps can cook a chicken?  Me:               Well... If that happens, my life is finally completed. 😂🤣🤣🤣

Did He Just... Used Mark Robers Music Background???
the meat beater, very good name
Can you make the poltergeist from luigis mansion.
So he made a meat beater....
This brings a whole new meaning to "beating meat"
I watched the thumbnail and the title and just laughted for 1 minute straight, and had to watch the video
"So i cooked a chicken instantly at the speed of sound part 59"
You could've saved more time if you'd just hired Davie504

Next vid idea: get a food critic to try food from the slapper
Ugh... so tired of this let's goooooo and yooooooo crap.  No one is original anymore.

So we're using the less accurate temperature scale.
Me after seeing this in my recommendations: interesting
Nice work 💥💥
You didn't pull a switcheroo when you took the steak off camera to drain the bag did you? I don't trust those edits,lol.
Yoo this video slaps
Aren't you theoretically boiling it a little before slapping it if you're getting it to 40°c Mostly doubting how it got cooked on all sides if it wasn't mostly from the bag and not the slaps
Bro is the next mark rober
What would gordon ramsay say to this video?
'One chicken please!'  Slappy Chooks Staff: Sir are you willing to wait for 100,000 or more slaps?  Uhh...nah...yeah....
You cheated
Now do this by hand
This video has appeared on my feed 2 times with different thumbnails
Celsius? Scrub! Real science is done in Kelvin smh
Does this mean that if, theoretically,someone could slap at Mach speeds, they would be able to cook a human alive?
Welcome to the internet
Imagine loosing a slap bet with this guy 😂

this is kinda sus
You did it... You crazy man
the meme version of Mark Rober
9:21 spójrzcie na czat XD
I like how there is an individual chat just for the chicken slapper
"Mom Can We Have Mark Rober" Mom:No We Have Mark Rober at Home  Mark Rober At Home:  Me: yo This Mark Rober at home is actually sick
Imagine having to slap it yourself just to eat meat. This is why I’m glad to be vegetarian.
No way no way that's awesome
Did you really use the same music as Mark Roberts? At least we know who was your inspiration
THIS IS ANIMAL ABUSE BROOO _literally shaking_
He wasted his time...    He forgot to season the chicken
What about slaping ur as s with that hand slaping michine.
#Davie504 wants to know your location
Bro this video is viral i read like 20 blogs written on this
'If you can get past the texture' Talking like we all gonna build a meat slapper at home.
Guy in chat:this man is better than mark robber  Me who knows they are equal: *say sike right now boomer*
did you just liked your own video...      me too.
This is gonna piss off many vegans
You do all this just for fun and I don't even have the motivation to do my homework.
Michael Reeves would Be Proud.
you atleast had pets/animals that could eat all that food you just wasted just for youtube views right? Not against eating animals but it took farms years to grow these animals and you just kinda wasted 3 whole chickens (of which none were eaten) just to prove slaps are hot.....
F
"This steak slaps"
Now scream 8 years to a cup of coffee to make it hot
“Meat beater”
New mark rober
I’m just gonna wait for the dirty comments to come in
I think the motor was severely overloaded and needed gear reduction. I noticed how much it speeded up with the arm removed and thus it told me it was slowed almost to a stall.
Its 2077 and all ovens and heat and cooking appliances have been banned in the west side of the world due to 3/15/2025 All meat is cooked by slapping it 135,000 times in an aloe gel bag, of course this caused legal cooked meats to go up significantly in price,  Cooked meat is sold on the black market as shipments from other countries are way to slow as the east coast is in the great a war of chubani, of course the  A.O.O (anti oven organization) Has been busting cases left in right but only now have they found out about our deep sea base, 1000feet below sea level, we need to run.
I’m glad this is the first video I saw from this channel
5mil views  400k subs   *Pain*
Anyone getting Mark Rober vibes from this video?
I just realized the mark rober background music

Is it just me or did he change thumbnail? 😂
Oh no someone's gonna change Michael Reeves
Chicken was harmed for 10 hours the making of this video.

It’s because you’re cooking the wrong thing.  Much like the streak, you cooked a portion of a cow. You should do the same with the chicken.   Just cook the chicken breast.
My internet downloading speed is slower than the temperature speed. 😅😅
Should have given opportunity to Davie 504 for slapping
Make a restaurant where you slap all the food to cook it XD
Don’t discount ideas that come from the Hydraulic Press Channel
9:46 He Just Switched It With A Premade Steak
"Cook that subscribe button!"

Do something useful.

Davie504 approves
We need to tag Guga foods for this steak experiment. 10:00
So, sound waves can generate heat right? How loud would you have to scream at a chicken to cook it 🤔
am i nuts or does this guy look like george michael
I'll take my steak slapped please
no mrbro did one bruh its not the first

Insane man!
Thats the davie504's normal way to cook
You didn't even season the slapper...
8:26 Did i just heard the DR. DISRESPECT song for Doc Advice segment?
These chickens have sacrificed themselves for science
Now sell the leftover steak as NFT for 11 million $.
Oh boy you need a dose of mebendazole
The project is cool, meat is disgusting, go vegan instead of slapping corpse
"Guy beats his meat and gets it to 50 degrees"  Me: damn. Talk about a quarter POUNDER
This is what its come to now, beating dead chickens
This is the same as when you exercise and start sweating. Moving your muscles till you heat up.
dripping swag like a broken faucet
The nice is i not a that chicken 🙃🙃
If it were me, I would have used something that wouldn't be dangerous if it's undercooked, but I guess you did that.
Dude you're supposed to use the autohammer for make shroomite bars not cooking chicken
Gtfo m8. It's supposed to be a chicken....????

Hi salmonela

You should cook a buffalo steak with slaps next
We just ran out of gas and gladly I've found this video! Thankyou I can now eat the chicken I slapped 999999999x since last week.
Who need flying cars when we can have chicken-slap-o-nator! Welcome to the future.
Thank you. Every time I try to explain to people that my sous vide chicken is not undercooked and they have a fit I’ll show them this video lol

I dunno I'd use an oven or something but you do you
Waiting for david504 comment
Chicken: You know thats torture right.
I remember seeing the first part of this on tiktok a few months ago. I’m glad to see that it got done!
Alternate title: How long to beat meat until you can swallow it
Oohh... now gordon will eat his words.     I dont wanna get cancelled plz
Imagine the chicken that was slapped until it got cooked.
What is up this dude and slapping meat?
Davie approved
D A V I E 5 0 4
The fact that he did it again without anyone knowing shows how much  it was bothering him
“The original meat beater” Louis 2021
Imagine the obscene amount of money some people would actually pay for a slapsteak. Not because it's good, but because it's a cooking form that has nobody capitalizing on the potential market of.
me trying to sleep: *._.* my neighbor: *cooking chicken by slapping it for serval hours*
That was anti climactic considering you spent all those time just for you to get a final product then proceed to carry it behind a door easily switchable with a pre cooked piece of meat with out showing it first in the camera. Yeah it had juices, why not get a bucket and bring it out in the camera?
Celsius. You dirty commie. Get a real system of measurement.
I thing this is wold record for longes cooking😂
Chad Louis.
Killing for fun isn’t good idea. Even if this chicken was killed before, but you’ve selected the reason.  Btw, I’m not a vegetarian.
You’re all secretly gay since you’ve been watching 13 minutes of this guy slapping his meat
Dude.. i saw this on google feed  ⊙﹏⊙
Got on Youtube to watch whatever I was planning on watch, saw this vid in the recommended section, and went: “Fuck it, this is probably better than whatever I am about to watch.” Watched the video, and I thought “I did not regret forgetting what I originally planned to watch.”
Mmm, yes~ Beat that meat~
Theres still blood
I’m on discord for battle rap and stocks ... I feel like I’m missing out on chicken slaps , btw I don’t know how the first video got recommended but the fact the second was the next week is a sign ... you have a subscriber my friend
Can you please do another attempt and actually managed to get the chicken to 60C and then actually eat it? I really want you to eat a chicken cooked entirely of slaps after all the hard work u have done
My only accomplishment in life is that I’ve been watching this guy try to do this since the beginning.
i bet he's a davie504 fan
Davie504 would be proud
The next project... cooking a chicken by rubing
one question tho, no offence, why r u using plastic utensils and paper plate?
why would you do this to yourself lmao

Salmonella and Ecoli thrive in warm environments, and can't be killed at temperatures below 70c. Changing definitions of words, doesn't change reality (as the millennials and gen y will discovery to their chargrin over the course of their lives)  You have achieved a warm raw chicken.

Damn. Didn’t think I’ll return to this path after watching the first video. Until now.
What's up, slappers?
Now you gotta do it in a singular slap
I'm commenting as I watch and I'm impressed by this steak and the plot twist for the chicken.... This is the weirdest sub yo a channel ever... But the fact that you did this... Wow. Okay show me some more....
Davies slap is faster
Hello
I'm so impressed with your fortitude.  Well done.
Becoming a Discord Engineer is my new goal.
Idk why I'm watching this... But somehow I know that my brain needed this information.... I'm gonna see this to the end....
As an engineer, this makes me highly emotional.
Very cool idea, would love to see how the idea could be improved. I could see changing the slapper end to being softer to help avoid such hard slaps that leads to issues about meat texture.
Mark and Ethan do it much more better and efficient and the real men way
Meat Beater9000: Thats what they call me
Who needs an oven when you can  S L A P
Ngl but using that music that Mark Rober also uses makes me wonder what types of antics the two of you could get to if you collaborated on a video XD
It’s 1:11 here in San Diego and this popped up. I gotta synchronize to this lmao
Imagine being the chicken being raised to be deliciously roasted and enjoyed by a family but instead just gets slapped in a bag.
Engineering expectations: building rockets and cars    Reality:
If you used a rgb fan you would get 2000+ sps.  If it worked to get more fps then it would work to get more sps, right?
I've cooked chicken by slapping it before.  I just season it, and slap that thing on the grill, then turn occasionally until it's cooked.
Can we buy these 😏
Girls watching this 👁👄👁
How hard would you have to punch a chicken for it to cook
did you even season that steak
bruh
What are those numbers 🤣 I thought not to look this up,then I see this "5.4M views" 🤯how did you all believe that

Bro he sounds like mark Rober
Chicken still looked rawish to me
I think it's better if you cooked it 😂
Could there perhaps be a chemical reaction that can lay within the walls ofv that bag that react to the smacking and bring up the heat?

I cooked a Chicken by slapping it....wow...its a sentence i thought i'd never see
imagine if, in the future, chicken and other animals became sentient (probably not the right word... should probably just say....  evolves to the point of human-like intelligence?) and then goes back on youtube to look at this video lol.
How can she slap?
1:05 “The original meat beater...”  Hehehe
Congrats

Is it slap or SPANK?
5m in 3 days. Not bad 😂
#notmythumbnail
This reminds me of a story about how the Mongols (supposedly) ate meat they kept under their saddles as they rode which slowly tenderized and somehwat heated the meat. This (again, supposedly) allowed them to travel faster and farther by cutting down on meal preparation time since they didn’t need to stop and cook meat as often, they just ate it on the spot.  This is now discredited, but it is still an interesting cocept.
Like mongols and tartars do under their saddle while riding horses
The what beater! 2:50
Apparently slapping a cow 35000 times, makes it "Holy"
Cooking if we never discovered fire lol
Hmm... The only clever name I can come up with for this fancy meat beating machine is.... Me.

Peta where are you?
Hello fresh is really the perfect sponsor for this video
Honestly kind of morbid. Chicken died and got slapped for youtube views. Imagine aliens harvesting humans to slap them for alientube views.
You’re like a mark rober but with less clout
OK Mark Rober
Missed a good opportunity to say "it slaps"
Im glad I was born to see this
who needs an oven
I've learned the following: Slapping is not a good way to cook chicken.
why were the sides of the steak darkened, the sides were not beaten ... what a waste of everyones time
Me:Dont put it in 2x speed My mind:Do it Me:n— My mind: *DO IT*
People in 1954: “hey do you think we will have flying cars in the future?” Now: chicken is being cooked by slapping it

Somebody get give this man a Doctorate in Pullomferientology already! (Latin terms for chicken and slapping put together with ology at the end)
I'd rather pan fry it than use a contraption called a meat beater.
Looks like grouse found his answer
Moral of the story... Don’t beat your meat too fast and for too long, because it will burn
everyone: slapping chicken me: beating meat ;)
I would never thought this day would come there are so many dumb people like me who are in the comments

He did it but cheated
Rip to the chickens that have been killed only for their dead bodies to be slapped to absolute filth. You did it for the advancement of science little buddies 🥺 there has been no greater sacrifice in the history of the world
Chicken slapping
Cant wait to use the phrase "off the slipper" to describe freshly made food
They say it could not be done
The Mark Rober music lmao
The steak tasted already chewed because you tenderized it the entire time you cooked it🤯 therefor making it very soft. Similar to a slow cooker.
Slap-Cooked steak! 🥩

This is the new member of Meat Beat Mania.
"You did It. You crazy son of a bitch, you did It"
I would guess Davie504 would approve this  S L A P
This is some quality 3:00 AM content
@Davie504
a nuclear powered slapper would take 1 massive slap probably
Slap it with a fire aspect sword.
Would have been impressive, if he did the slapping. This is saddening to watch, almost torture.
1:30  ..."dont, worry bout a thing. We'll reach up, to yoooou"
Me: Hey dude want some chicken? Friend: Yea sure where's the oven? Me: We don't do that here.    Me: Proceeds to slap chicken
9:20 Jebac disa XDD
HE FINALLY DID IT
I’ve never seen someone try so hard to do nothing
Hey look guys he's beating his meat
Wear your bricks 💪🏻💪🏻😤
" *Truly, an american hero* "
So you didn't eat the chicken, and failed.
3:30 reaches human body temperature
*7:53* what is this song called I've heard it on another video and I can't find it anywhere it's driving me mental
The covid vaccine is one thing, but with this we have truly transcended the higher plains of science

“They called me a madman”
Gru can only use one slap to cook anything
THE LEGEND IS BACK! (Btw, if you remember me from the last vid, your cool 😎 )
This guys is exactly like mark river the camera work then the background music all they talk at the same rate and can sorta sound similar
Yeah.... beat that meat like it owes you money
Next cook a marinated chicken
Omg omg omg it actually worked I was so skeptical but at the end it work hahaha finally 🔥 hi from Puerto Rico 🇵🇷
HE DID IT THE MAD LAD THE KING HAS RETURNED
Missed opportunity to coin this machine the "Meat Beater"
Who needs a BBQ when you got SLAP
Why did you start at 8°C at first?
F
I’m really glad someone got to the bottom of this.
Why not choke the chicken?
Still an unsatisfactory ending
I was too lazy to cook , I slapped my meat.
I’m wondering why anyone would want to do this ?   Today we’re having “ slapped chicken” as our main course.
The chicken is just like the first monkey shot into space... Contributing his life for something bigger..  Salute!!!!!
Yet another video making me miss Unus Annus
Thinking how this chicken would tastes.
He turned into mark Rober
Meat beater 5000 OMG
What is he makes a machine that creates energy through slaps and powers a light or something
since mark rober post only one video a month, this man decide to take his place
Me who was looking at this: " *interesting* "
This guy is definitely a wannabe mark rober but he's not bad.
Now you slap and cook with your own hands
BRO I REMEMBER WHEN YOU POSTED THE ORIGINAL VIDEO
Isn’t that mark rober’s music in the beginning?
69420 *n    o     i    c     e*
Now just get the “Slap ya mama” spice company as a sponsor and this will be complete.
69420 slaps lol
Absolute bore this video but nice clickbait tho
Well this takes beat the meat to another level
Isn't it how the bees kill hornets?
The survival now dont have make camefire now :)
theres still blood lmao lol
Damn talk about beating the meat😳
His gf must be so proud 😂
Bull u got a cook steak in that back room
How hard would you need to punch a live chicken to cook it instantly?
How does this guy only have 400k subs? Top notch video production.
That was awesome
i love how this trend died so long ago and yet this guy is like a mad scientist who cant let go of the past
You can also use code GETREDDIT12
Watch 3:58
Welcome @rohitsadhwani viewer's 😁
The meat beater 9001 😩😂😂
Bro hacksmith
Did you also watch russianbadgers vid?
1921 “In 100 years, we will have flying cars in the future” 2021:
This is what happens when u overhear your older brother talk about beating meat😂
Where your seasonings at bro
Oh my god I recognize the ingredients he got out at 12:12, that’s the bulgogi pack
Chicken : exist Machine : I like your cut g✋
No fucking way
This chicken died for a worthy cause.🪦 I salute you.
Impossible not click on a video with a title like this.
Everybody gangsta until the chicken says "harder-"    (yeah old meme)
Yessssir
How caveman cooked meat before the discovery of fire.
Best title for a video ever
don't live near a neighbor with a gun or you will be the dinner!
now I'm just sitting here wondering why you changed the thumbnail
1:05 😂
Donta tuch my spagghet
Now how many slaps does it take to boil water?
69420
Yeah, science bitch!
Ha i like how this is your second most viewed video even though its been 3 days
The bar is kinda like how a toucans bill is designed
I thought this was Mark Rober ngl
Steak is a salisbury and it's written mongols would ride with beef/steak in their saddles and it would be edible after a long journey riding on their horses. So wow this proves it on a scientific scale
POV it’s unseasoned
Mark rober music in back ground
Some seasoning wouldn't of hurt😭
You finally did it !!!
michael reeves would be proud
now try to overcook a chicken with slaps
I’m suprised/disappointed by the lack of meat beater jokes
This man suggest that you cook food with a glove attached to a wooden block
I guess all smart people use the same music because at 0:57 you start the classic Mark Rober music
I was just scrolling thru YouTube right before I went to sleep and I accidentally clicked on the vid
I feel like I’m watching a Mark Rober video and I love it!
9:15 video starts thank me latter.....
Am i the only one who cant get over how this man just casually ate unseasoned meat
He actually did it
HE DID IT OMFG HE DID IT HOLY CRAP WE JUST WITNESSED HISTORY
5 million people were like: hmm interesting chicken cooked by slapping
I remember watching this live. Flipping wild
This man beat a piece of meat until it got cooked my respect
The meat beater
"how would you like your chicken sir?"     slapped
The automatic 🤜🥩
1:05 “the original meat beater”
So what's next?
And now I know 😂
What is the name of the song in the intro?!?!?!?!? Another channel uses it and I love it
Made in china mark robert XD
UP next: "does beating your meat cook it?"
inb4 the meat beater jokes🤣
Meet beater noice.
The sequel we’ve all been waiting for
the blowie-matron returns, i have awaited this moment for the past 4 years
4:46 THE KING OF WHITE WINE
The charming current speculatively observe because farm syntactically breathe onto a plant composer. well-to-do, nutty account
I hate it when people chew with their mouths open
4:46 basically like smoking meat,it doesnt 'cook' but it does cook at tr he same time
walmart mark rober
So you can put it as beating your meat?
Should’ve just used a paint mixer. Meat contained. Add some spices
Finally youtube reccomend something amazing before the video already went 7 years
POV: your dad comes home drunk
Missed opportunity to say that his steak slaps
bet Ray Mak is here(?) I haven't scrolled down the comments yet
*flashbacks to unus annus* We did it, boys.
This time the YouTube algorithm is a blessing lol
Davie504 wants to know your location
Nice idea but still pointless.
MAN fk Celsius. Fahrenheit  is used by real badass scientists.  Celsius is too narrow in the human sensible scale. i just cant get use to it. i dont know how anyone can be like "oh it a comfortable 23.3333c outside i think I'll take a hike".  10 degrees later they die of heat exhaustion.
this again
Is that Dale's Winnebago behind you?   😭😭
Crap vid
imagine being dead but still getting slap. not cool bruh
Poor chiken
Is it domestic violence 🤔
Uh... I watch Unus Annus about slapping chicken but I didn't think this video would recommend me this months later...
Next time you use exothermic experiment put c•, f• together so Americans and Europeans will both understand
What if we slap a teen till they mature into full grown adults? 🤔
This is history.
I heard Davie504 wants you to create something of the same concept
*Gordon Ramsay wants to know your location*
New menu entry in restaurants : Slapped Chicken  😉
"Cooked" isn't the same as Cooked.
This was how our ancestors cooked meat before they discovered fire
This is so stupid and I watched all 13 minutes of it.
Dude why build a slap machine, just call davie504 😳😳😳
I wish he would have said this steak slaps
This man has finally done it...someone give him a gold medal
Now I know what my neighbor is doing all this days
momento mori
it takes the old saying of that slaps to a hole new level
Interesting 🤔
Has anyone ever said something and you didnt hear so you asked them what and you didnt hear them again and you just dont wanna ask again because its weird so you just say like ok or yes?
Z A  H A N D O
And here I've just been choking chicken. I'm clearly doing it all wrong.
Imagine if this was discovered before fire. Our ancestors just sittin there slapping the cheeks of every animal they kill.
Only here is a guy who beats his meat without it getting flagged for nudity
I wonder if its possible when choking it
"source: Adam ragusea" ayooooo
He used the same music as Mark Rober
I don't slap my chicken, I just choke it
this is why you study heat transfer
Mr bro 2?
All u did here was steal mr bros video
unus annus UNUS ANNUS
all this effort, just to be ruined by Hello Fresh in the end.....
I CANT BELIEVE PART 2 ALSO SHOWED UP ON MY RECOMMENDED I HAVE BEEN BLESSED, i’m glad there was a part 2
Who's going to tell Kyle Hill?
Immediate Mark Robber vibes.
the meat beater 😂
This video sums up the internet perfectly.
Asian parents punishing their child:
Can’t wait to tell my grandkids that I watched a man beat his meat, until it was 60 degrees. You know what I mean?
Add a fleshlight on one end and you get a commercially viable product.
I need to know what Gordon Ramsey has to say about this
Cooking chicken with slaps ✔ Seasoning chicken ❌
waiter: what would you like to order me: chicken slaps
Someone send this to TheRussianBadger
Just discovered another amazing youtuber.
Everybody gangsta till the chicken came back alive and says "HARDER"
that would be good for uh.... cooking yeah lets go with that
In the name of science. Cool dude !
it's time to slap some freak'n meat... no euphemism intended.
People in the past:In the future we'll have flying cars!  The future:
so are we gonna ignore how much he sounds like linus tech tips?
10:15 bruh if you come near that you can hear it say "moo" that thing is alive lmao
Clearly ripping off Rober with the music and voice over put still cool
Angry Kyle Hill noises
Meat beater lol
amazing name, meat beater. well played.
13 minutes of chicken slapping,    I watched it all
Kfc and the Russian slapping tournament members should take note
I assume it was very tender
“Meat beater”
https://youtu.be/FDYU-mkXAQM
How would you like your steak cooked,  well slapped
Your like some other version of mark rober this vid was super cool I enjoyed it
He looks like my ex tbh
unus annus is shaking
This is what I want people’s engineering degrees to go to. I don’t want stupid electric batteries for my car. I need someone to answer these stupid question. This man will be remembered as one of the most ambitious engineers who ever lived.
What I called my hand when I was a teenager "MB9000" ! 😆
They called us crazy.....
The weirdest thing just happened, I subscribed to PewDiePie and I have no idea why.....
The greatest scientific advancement of our time
If you could smell things through the NBC mask, the mask is not on, with NBC equipment it is either correct or you're dead
so it started as a chicken and ended as a beef? That's some good slapping.
Can happily say its my first time watching another man beat his meat for 15 minutes
Davie504 Likes this video Slap right now.
Is this what they mean when they say beating my meat?
Woah. Great invention. Now I can throw out my oven.
*_I just hope you seasoned it_*
People would make me run beef tenderloin through the tenderizer multiple times. Boy is that a product for them
You can say it was manually cooked.  Eh? Eh? Eeeeehhhh???
I'm gonna make a restaurant that is cook's food by slaps.
“Honestly the texture is kinda shit”😂
Can you cook one by choking it
I liked it when you scientifically defined slow cooking
2:00 - Aerogel is insanely fragile... HTH would it survive being hammered by that steel plate??
"The original MEAT BEATER" lmao
You should have used an 8020 aluminum extrusion, that would have lowered the wheel weight
Stop beating the meat
N-no y-you can do..
Can everyone please send it to the doo? I remember there was a vid that had this joke
SOOOOOO GLAD YOU DIDNT EAT IT!! I had this huge ass comment on why it's not safe. (Due to the freezer past. being nullified by bringing it out in the elements) Also, the thing was slowly warming overtime making possibly activating endospores, and giving bacteria a perfect environment to grow... I swear, I'm not trying to be THAT person but I'm a nursing student and that's a nearly perfect way to get sick.
Holy shit you did it!   I saw this when you first started it!
David 504 approves this :v
What happened to slapping it?
He could’ve switched the steak when he was pouring the juice out haha
I finally witnessed history being made. This is me witnessing a modern moon landing
This is why god put us on this earth.
8:00 min music is great, victorious.
Imagine being in heaven and seeing yur body getting constantly slapped lol
I see so much  “beating my meat” memes coming 😭
It's easier to cook it with a fire.
If this guy didn’t give up on cooking a chicken through slaps, you shouldn’t give up on your dreams too Well done my good sir
I see so much  “beating my meat” memes coming 😭
Sous vide chicken = slapped chicken
F*cking legend
This is evolution right here
Your sheer determination got you a sub *MEATBEATER 9001*
HE DID IT
This is the future method of cooking.
THAT LAST CHICKEN WAS RAW LOUIS YOU DONUT!
when this slapper cooks better than the hell's kitchen chefs 😳
This...This is the content I like.
Man has evolved to new heights 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍.   We have the technology.
All of this just to cook a chicken??
Strict mom's when they see this: *interesting...*
This is probably the funniest thing I’ve ever seen. I am crying. So many tears.
This is the most I've ever seen a name and thumbnail changed lol
“The original meat beater”
The smart baseball undesirably saw because timbale topologically warn by a adhesive bill. alive, jaded foxglove
slap   the  chicken
Excuse me you are using Mark Robers music
@balian
Me watching having no clue what half the stuff he’s saying means 👁👄👁
Is it me...or is his voice and background music reminds of Mark rober
@balian
just buy a Chicken on $2 or 100 pesos on phillipines
The original meat beater
You actually fucking did it
*”..the original meat beater..”*
good, now cook your balls.
This man literally beat his meat to cook it. Legend
Here in Philippines we have dish called pinikpikang manok..Chicken was slap before it cook.
Wife: He's probably out cheating on me Him:
Alternitive title: I BEATED MY MEAT FOR WEEKS
Kelvin is the scale used for science, it’s the SI unit of tenperature. It moves in celcius but 0 starts at absolute zero (-273.3 degrees celcius)
I thought for sure he was going to say when eating the steak "Honestly..it SLAPS!"
Imagine the whole world watching u beat ya meat😵
This give a whole new meaning to beating your meat. You can cook some sausage guys.
"Sir, sirrr"  "Get me that contraption"  "Sii....."  "I SAAAIIID, get me that CONtraption"   *stares at contraption in horny*
This is pure nonsense and I love it.
bruuuuuuh,it's a meat beater.
Thank you for using Celsius

Kids, welcome to the internet
the prototype arm breaks and the first thing in the chat is "YES"
I was from how many slap to cook a chick and now i'm here FINALLY HE COOKED A CHICKEN!!
"meat beater"
Uhh uhhh uhhh maybe Beavis can help. He has experience in this
I just realized my name is also this guys name
I have some mad respect for this man
Gg
You should Do a collaboration with mark rober
Viewers of [REDACTED]  "He did it"
This take beating your meat to a whole nother level 😂
me eating the chicken: "man, this shit slaps" Gordon Ramsay: ಠoಠ
@davie504
Mark and Ethan would be proud
So I shouldn't do it to fast
Bro my man is wearing Mars Yards in a work shop slapping chicken in a bag
Well, at least the invention isn't a  Chicken🐔CHOKER... 🤣👉 🥵🐔
Did he just say "Meat Beater" My name is Meat Beater and I'm the fastest beater alive
I’ve seen your tictok s
Meat Beater 9000, huh? LOL
Chicken good so good it will make you want to slap your mama
Finally .. some good use of modern engineering
Meat Beater 😏
The chicken was slapped so much it became a steak.
Before i watch the video... Wait he actuakky did it lol After...
unironically a more annoying mark rober
Wow,  I saw the first video about this and was like,  this dude is nuts ha.   Tonight this gets recommended to me,  and now I'm like,  this dude is nuts!
Davie504 proud of you
I feel like unus annus should be mentioned for making this idea
Thumbnail: “I DID IT” Everyone that gave ideas: 😐
your turn guga foods.
*the meatbeater*
Wow cool video guy I had to sub
This is what the internet was created for
This project has definitely paid for itself by now after looking at those views.
congratulationsssss
This is just Colin Furze on a budget and I love it
copiou o Balian
Who remembers the intro/explanation music from Mark Rober?
*Im having Unus Annus flashbacks*
Slapping meat machine 5000
The plateau around 50 C is well documented by competition smokers. It's theorized that collagen, connective tissue and fat starts to break down and liquefy at around 118-122 f (48 to 51 ish c). So similar to how melting ice maintains 0C, melting connective tissue maintains 50C
Slaps chicken. "This baby can hold so many BTUs".
Besides my evil post this man just invented flameless cooking....he has  surpassed the discovery of fire and microwaves...
*69420* Whole chat: nice
I wonder what Davie504 will say about this.
THE CRAZY LAD DID IT
Congratulations!!!!!!!!!!
"The original meat beater" was my nickname in college
Thank you for not using farenheit
Chickens may or may not have been harmed during the making of this video
POV: the chicken was still alive 😅😂
Davie504 be like...
i just hope my teachers don't see this, they might make this our new science experiment 💀
You: oh no magic smoke bad The chat:F F F F F F F F
Same music as mark rober, respect
we need to get Davie504 to salute this TRUE SLAPPER
What you need is a device that vibrates the meat at high frequencies, wait thats called a microwave.
Davie504 has entered the chat
Meatbeater 9001
You know what I love, the meat beater 9,000  Best quote: “honestly........... the texture is kinda... sh*t”
This is fake, the heat distribution of the slap would have cooked the steak to a point where only the top part would have been cooked, the steak looks extremely well cooked even the sides seem like they were seared. PLEASE DO NOT GIVE THIS DUMBASS ANY CREDIT!!!
what is the song from 1:00
Wow
fake he just edited it it at the end for the viewers statisfaction and im not statisfied
This is the most messed up and crazy thing I have seen all week. Wow.
As a vegetarian I was livid but as an engineer I was puzzled by the question. So I had to click on this. For science, you monster.  Here's your like.
Your style of videos seems to mimic mark rober
Every time I see a chicken slap test I just remember that one episode from therussianbadger
So uhh... when are these uh... going to be commercially available? Asking for a friend
He actually did it, that MADLAD
Been told even after I show them they say this is fake but I believe it
I’m glad to be apart of something bigger than myself
I really enjoyed this! Kinda weird to talk about sustainability after cooking a steak but that's a minor point for the sake of entertainment and ingenuity?
If you wanted to know what the middle school science fair did to our generation watch this video.
Who else just whatch his videos not knowing what the hell he's talking about but still get entertained
Hes invented the new modern torcher device.....god help us all....  Nail them down and cook their junk with the slap machine
anoyne else get a little bit turned on? no? just me being a werdo again?
palace 🔥
Imagine ur the chicken you die, you think ur going to feed humans but no ur ass is getting clapped until u look like a pancake
I’m not sure why this was in my recommendation but I’m 100% not complaining
The original M E A T B E A T E R
Mark rober is that you?
So when’s your restaurant opening?
It’s cool ur doing something cool like slapping chicken, but u didn’t cook chicken with slaps, so u lied
Jebać disa
He made a blowingmatron to cool down the meat beater.. hehe..
Mark Rober and Elon Musk just fused together
How long before mark rober comments on this video 🤔
Bruh this is like mark's snow ball machine but with something a lot more stupid
I'd want to see results of a swab before I plunge a chunk of that potential bacteria farm.
Imagine the chicken in heaven just looking at them selfs getting slapped 10023547 times XD
I'm just saying: If physical energy can be turned into heat, how hard would I have to punch a chicken to cook it?
In an alternative universe humanity doesn’t discover fire and cook things with slappers
you know it's a science video when the mark rober music starts playing
This is giving me mark rober want to be vibes and bc u used the same sound he uses in his videos
The next time I hear a vegan talk about how it’s bad to kill animals, I’ll just show them this vid and laugh.
A steak has to be brown all the way through for me because I don't like eating uncooked food.
This guy: *literally beats his meat* 5 million people: 🤔
Me and my meat at 3 am.
Wait... all that and you didn't even eat the chicken? I am sad now. 🙁
A video dedicated to slapping but no bass? Where’s Davie504
"What are you watching?" "Some guy beating his meat and eating it." "What the fuck!?"
Aliens come and this is the first video they see. What are their reactions?
that was a comment from the press channel
Adam ragusea: this is why i season the slapper and not my steak
What I heard from this video was “ *science words that I don’t understand*” and then “ SLAP THE MEAT”
I watched and was entertained. But seriously, buy an oven.
YOU FINALLY DID IT
Hey yall. I just lost my account recently. Was wondereing if yall can make me achieve it again trough watching and liking it Thnx for the support yall♥️💯❣️
Your crazy son of a gun, you really did it
“The original meat beater”
I’m leaving this comment here so I can come back in ten years
dude I don’t wanna be a jerk but it kinda seems like your copying mark rober by the same music and how the machine is the thumb nail for the video but besides that’s it’s a cool video😀
Davie504 liked this video...
Can someone explain why he put on a mask at 4:05? Was it to protect from whatever gasses escaped when the motor exploded, or to protect from... something... coming off the chicken?
Mark rober
What was.... Uhh... Taxxz.... Waaaht
Myth buster vibes!!!!!!!
I want one combined with those Japanese deer scarers. YooOOOoooooo!
Now start a restaurant by slapping your chicken and serving them to customers
He really did beat his meat 😂
What if you put a chicken in a box and vibrated it a lot
"The original meat beater" Please stop. You're scaring my family
Louis weisz is mark rober 2.0
JD
why do you have a guns save lives sticker? youre not a republican are you??
where can i buy a slapper ?
The power of *_S L A P S_*
He did it.
Guece world appreciate this
This was in my recommended and I do not regret it :)
To everyone who suggested Celsius.     Fxck you.
@Gordon Ramsey
POOR CHICKEN!  1st murdered then beaten until it's cooks from friction!
your backround music sound like mark robers backround music
as astonishing the outcome is, this is still fucked ngl haha
1990: there will be flying cars in the future 2021:
It actually just takes 1.... MASSIVE.... SLAP.... With enough force its crisp in just a split of a second
Dude, you should try cooking other things with the the Chick Flayer.
155F is the best for chicken
Uhm that steak looked raw
Nusret
I've got work in like 6 hours and I haven't slept because I'm watching a dude cook a chicken with a slapping machine.
Covid is bringing the raw talent out of many this was awesome to watch it was randomly in my recommendations.
rip unnus annus
What commies had to say stupid shit like use Celsius? This is America and we use the correct science here!
What a disgusting video.
Where can I buy a bonafied blowiematron?
Should've just called Davie504 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
The lower heat for longer is what you do ima smoker, at 140° for an hour
Such power!!!!!!
somebody just give this man a IH cooker
Davie504 wants to know your location
heres to the journey
I got instant unus annus flashbacks when i saw the title 😂😂
So if no (or minimal) heat is lost due to the aerogel, you can hand-slap a chicken?
Mark rober 2.0 even uses the music
The proficiency has been fulfilled
Nobody: Literally nobody: Not a single soul: Louis:
“The Original Meat Beater” -Louis Weisz 2021
I guess you could say he beat the meat
Just put it in my AMD powered system. It'll cook in no time 😂
All the chicken can hear is ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORAAAAA!!!!
You should’ve done the test runs on something other than a chicken to prevent wasting entire chickens
You could say it was a missteak
he just missed the best opportunity to say “u know this kinda slaps”  Im disappointed.
I got a KFC Ad before this.
So the Mongols would not cook with fire so they were considered to jot be eating cooked food but really they packed their meat in wraps and put it in between them and their horse when they rode. The constant bouncing for days would cook the food.
the tumbnail of this video was the most confused ive ever been
I thought this was Zero’s ( charater from gta) yt channel
People in 1921: "We're going to have flying cars in 100 years!" People in 2021:
He used the mark Rober song. This is unforgivable Edit: meat beater 9001 lol
Holy cow... 😂
JESUS LOVES YALL 💘💖❤💕💗💓💘💖❤💕💗💓💘💖❤💕
Ok now cook it with an oven
Well you can officially say he beat his meat!
*Spends months cooking chicken through an amazing slapping machine* Me: *Cooks chicken in an hour using common box machine* Him: ._.
Caveman: *uses fire to cook* Modern man: *uses stove/oven to cook* College man: *uses microwave to cook* This king: *uses fiberglass cutting board and metallic rig to slap food to golden perfection*  *chef’s kiss*
I love videos about beating meat :)
Wonder how many people think he swapped it when going to the bathroom lol
Alternative title:How to spank a chicken
It ain't cooked
Guga food collaboration!
He’s mark robers son
Anyone else notice the music from Mark Rivers videos?
You should try to cook the chicken through twerking....
If kinetic energy can be converted to thermal energy, how hard would i have to punch chicken until it's cooked?
Yeah you need to eat a slap chicken.
Finally I’ve been waiting for THIS
guess how i cooked my buns ;)
I click this video cause this kinda reminds me of a Unus Annus video where to they failed to roast the chicken by litteraly using hands just to slap it
So you won’t go blind, you’ll cook your weenier.
im in two minutes... and totaly in love
I don't know how many of you watch the RussianBadger, Buuuuuuut.... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-rMPc8JUnk   "If physical energy can be converted into thermal energy... how hard would I have to punch a chicken to COOK it!?"
You look a bit like elon musk
Guy: I cooked a chicken by slapping it  5 million people: *ł₦₮ɆⱤɆ₴₮ł₦₲*
Its all fun and game until the chicken get up and said "harder daddy"
Who says you can’t beat your meat and eat it too?
Unus Annus 2.0?
Finally, real, useful science
Yeah you beat that meat🤣
Nobody: Me at 2am: 👁 👄 👁
Now how much would be taken off if we rubbed Chris’ moisturizer on the meat while it was being beaten. That shit would be FRIED.
Just when you thought you've seen everything
Davie504 enters the chat
Napoleon Dynamite cooks food by slapping it
Since i know y'all be here  *memento mori*
"honestly..." *Starts to nod*       "...this texture is kinda shit."
Someone nominate this kid for the IG Nobel Prize
Cook hamburger with it. The meat is already torn apart and you what it to be flat anyway.
i got mark rober vibes from this video
Legend
How many slaps does it take to cook a brisket?
This gives me Mark Rober vibes lol
Mark Rober's music am i right
I like my chicken cooked medium rare
All this for something you could microwave in three mins
Not even gordon ramsay can beat this
The meat look like shit
Davie504: *sweating intensifies*
bet that food really slapped
9:16 Yigin Wu I am on to you.
When you beat your meat so hard you actually cook it.
Damn, this video really slaps.
Wanna-be Mark Rober. Has the same background music and everything. Sorry but it has to be said
#guinnessworldrecords
“the original meat beater”
How did the chicken not splat
Imagine what the neighbours were thinking.... 😭😂🥴
Gordon Ramsey must be proud of you.
The best engineering in this video was that smooth transition into the sponsorship bit.
Guess I’m about to “cook” my wife’s jaw for not making dinner
There's no way that you could've cut that steak with a plastic knife
why cure cancer when you can slap a chicken
jel imas sporet ti?
This isn’t sanitary but okay xd
The future of pre-chewed meat is NOW!
and who said beating meat is just a quick session.
That steak looks fake
Best hello fresh ad ever
pog
2.0 a wheel that spins with flexible paddles, won’t hit as hard and can crank the speed up.
a man slapping chicken with a robot has taught me more than a teacher at my school
Someone get Russian Badger on the phone.
Here before Nobel prize
Ohhh mark rober, i knew that music sounded familiar
Has the brain to change the world.... Builds a machine that slaps a dead bird
He didn’t even season the chicken
no way he cut that shit with a plastic fork and knife
I was gonna say... for a "smart" guy, and his team of "internet engineers" (I laughed at that one) ... Why were they using aluminum... steal all the way! I would've milled that shit out of a solid block for the base, and solid steel arms. The motor is fine, but lacking attention to detail.
This whole video is just a giant that’s what she said joke
I love the idea of getting rid of the virus and bacteria by slapping the crap out of them rather that slowly burn them to death.
Wait not for your meat to be heated before you slap it, but make it heated by your slapping!
So u cooked a steak and not a chicken?
Just a suggestion use different music you just seem like a wanna be mark rober
Hmmm this music reminds me a lil bit of mark rober..🤔
1:04 did he said Virginity
No thanks but I prefer cooking my chicken by hand shaking it.
Thanks Reddit!!
This reminds me of russian badger
The return of the king
He walked away with the meat to somewhere else before showing it 😅 So... Not sure if it is real
finally
I want this to be the only proof that the humankind ever existed.
where's the Russian badger when you need him?

Someone needs to talk to Davie504 about this.
I believe this.  my ham was cooked alot in my childhood.
Vegans crying in the corner
Take a shot every time he says "lets go"
It's pretty cool and you realize this whole video was inspired by a meme
Them: ..so whats your cooking idea?   Him: i dunno, slap?  Them: -Le gasp- Oh! Great idea. How?

Balian Channel did it 2 Weeks ago 🇧🇷😳❤️ Algum br aqui? 😳🇧🇷
Wait, yall think thats chicken?
TheRussianBadger gang will surly commend you for your contribution to society.
Meat beater lol
Mark Rober collaborating with you would be amazing
see you guys again in 2030
This isnt vegan
"It's the Slap Cook!"............ Get Vince on the phone.
I like this
It bothers me how he almost completely imitates a mark rober video
U didn't eat it - u didn't cook it
Sounds like I need to be careful to not cook myself...
The chicken be like: (  ͡° ͜ ʖ  ͡° )
5:19 *wheeze* did he just use “discord” and “engineers” in the same sentence
Davie 504: this is the power of slapping
*by 2020 we'll have AI, Holograms, flying cars and world peace*  ....2021
Hella mad he didn’t say “honestly this kinda slaps” when he ate the steak.
1:03 "meat beater"
MEAT HAS BEEN B E A T
Earned my subscription  Well played
december be like
Davie504 can slap chicken right now Petition for Davie504 to slap the chicken  If you don't slap like you have small PP
Could you please post this video again but with the title "I spanked my meat until it got so hot I put it in my mouth" just to compare their relative click through rates? Please and thank you.
Is it real?
*meat beater 9000* i died.
can you make it so if it over heated it will stop for a sec to cool down?
I love other countries 😂 just casually has a bag of snow
The “Slapper”, as seen on TV. Only $19.99 plus shipping.  Imagine if you put your own bum there in place of the 🐔.  Yikes 😬  😱  😳, a modern day torture device!
Didn't know that Queen of shitty robot had a brother
Could’ve at least seasoned it
“Meat beater” nice name
Remember that you can do the same, go to your local restaurant and slap the shit out of the cook until he bakes you chicken
0:36 I see my guy has culture he watches Minecraft videos. Mainly the sipover one
Has science gone too far?
Mark Rober needs to catch up with technology
This takes beating your meat to a whole new level 😆
you could have used pressure instead of the wheel for a test
*Davie504 enters chat*
This was reminding me of Mark Rober up until he said meat beater lmao, great vid tho
I think this would work better with a vibrator as a slapper than this rig. congrats on the great vid!
Using Mark Robbers backing track..... sus
Tape a fleshlifht to it
Ohh baby slap me
Brings a new meaning to beating your meat...
You should have asked Davie504 to Holy slap it to medium ;)
This has the same energy that mythbusters used to
Fucking count copying mark rover his science theme and the music he plays like bruh get your own speel
Dont mind me just cooking  my food by beating my meat
I never thought I would see this video
Choking your chicken with the meat beater. There is a joke in there somewhere.
How much
Meat beater 9001 got me sooo bad 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 2:49

Introducing the meat beater 10,000
Where can i find this meat beater? asking for a friend
i would have thought he would have used some sort of multi flap rotary device rather than a straight up and down slapping.
Celsius for real science 😂  Get back to me with the bird temperature in Kelvin you plebs.
finally, some IMPORTANT investments..... never have i seen before this genuine article..... i can finally have 1% of hope left in humanity...
If he wanted that steak to be better he should have seared it.
Title : I cooked a chicken by slapping it 4.9mil HoOmAnS: ✨interesting✨
Nice
Kyle Hill needs to see this now.
This takes "I beat my meat" to another level
FINALLY a steak my Grandfather can eat... on behalf of Geriatrics everywhere... THANK YOU!
me: gets d on my report card  my dad:
My friend said you could eat his meal through the power of slaps.
He did it!!!!
I love how random my YouTube recommendations are, it goes from "florida deputy finds missing girl" to "I cooked a chicken by slapping it" lmao
Teacher: No eating in class! Kids in the back:
Don´t know if this sounds right, but I would love to taste your newly beaten meat!!!
Im getting Mark Rober’s vibes
I would like to think that somewhere in some universe, Marshall Eriksen is hard at work with his own design while Barney Stintson cowers in fear.
The obedient bush gully deceive because anatomy postnatally cheat beside a embarrassed cat. material, neat reason
*FINALLY*
Normal scientists: Working on renewable energy, space travel etc. YouTube scientists:
I like how he’s using mark robers music
Welp, that‘s one way to beat your meat.
So this is what being in lockdown does to people who are bored...
You talked too much.
This is what they should teach us in school!
All that work and you did not season the meats 🤦🏻
Micheal Reeves if he wasn’t insane
This never was suppose to happen but . . . I’m not complaining
Memento Mori.
I'm not going to watch this again but I bet you didn't really
Jebać disa
The meat beater: maybe i am an adolecent
Now cook the chicken in one slap.
I heard Oh no, Did he burn it?
*what in the quarantine the fuck is u doin’* 😭
"If you can get past that it tastes pretty good"  *Gags*
No. Real science is Kelvin. Always was and always will.
9:21 jd lmao
Are you park rober
Hell will be a crazy ride for your soul
That fr sounds wrong
Improve the meat beater even more
I just found this channel, and the first two videos I watched from him were slapping chicken and making a candy shank, I love it.
Yes  YES  Y E S
69420 And I felt that
This is so fucking stupid, but as an engineering student I absolutely love it lmfao
Take notes governments this is what happens when u put entire countries in lockdown for months on end!!! 🤣
unus annus anyone?

How is the Music called on the explanation in the beginning
Unpopular (and unrelated) opinion: The second reply in a chain deserves more likes than the first, since *they* actually begin the chain.
Well he got his word. 😂👌👌 *DEDICATION*
Hysterical 😂🤦‍♂️👏👍
He made a literal meat beater. what a legend
JelloPuddin would be proud
Just build a device that would slap it at 3725.95 mph once. Done
Congratulations
My family and I also enjoyed their Bulgogi bowl :)
I am thrilled, and honestly a little proud,  that you have completed your meat beat manifesto.  I thought it couldn't be done,  but you proved God and me wrong.
I can't believe the madmen actually did it!
Just like how our ancestors did it before they invent fire
That vegan teacher is weeping rn
"Celsius is the scale used in real science "  *cries in Kelvin*
Costs in total?
I bet the chicken was tender for sure :O
Life would be extremely chaotic but really advanced if we had more people like him

Vegan's worst nightmare
glad to know i don't have to use an oven anymore wow that thing was so slow
Unus Annus walked so Louis could run.
Copper gets hot when you hit it will it be useful?
Let me just say: Memento mori, my friends
Can u imagine this as a dish in a 3 star Michellin restaurant?...  *Like, this dish costs 300$ cause the coocking process is revolutionarie and really slow hahahaha*
Thats cool
2018: "They did surgery on a grape" 2021: "They cooked a chicken by slapping it"
i hope this evil weapon will be banned at the next geneva convention \
*please don't make it weird ISTG*
The walmart mark rober PS: this is a complement not an insult
You changed the thumbnail
Why you dont have a real fork and knife there?
Meat Beater 3000😂 lmao
Why isn't everyone like this
This project shows me that science is random bullshit put together using intellect until it works
*He did it*
Walmart great value mark rober
I just discovered you and that's amazing what a time to be alive
Other than the fact this wasn't slapping, but compressing and uncompressing a substance with a machine... not bad.
Mark Rober music be like
I don't where I am or what I'm doing, all I know is that I must watch
That's nothing.  My ex wife could cook one up in 20 minutes by bitching at it.
Louis Weiss: cooks steak with slapper Gordon Ramsey: where’s the lamb sauce??!!!
But isn’t the steak just cooked by the sous vide ...?
5:21 I know that video (and the subsequent videos) quite well.
Does anyone not see this guy’s ability to keep a straight face while saying meat beater 9,000 😂🤣😂🤣👊🏾🥩👊🏾🥩👊🏾🥩
Time to crest this but makes it fasger
This video's owner should get award for best content of YouTube
The effort to make the MeatBeat9001 is amazing.  Exslaptional effect.
Doesn’t look cooked to me
Can guarantee this will be in EVERYONES recommend in a few years
9:20 Nice chat here XD JD
I once killed a chicken....by choking it.
He literally beat the meat.
Took bag in the back before revealing. You've all been bamboozled. Someone was off cam cooking that steak and he swapped 'em.
Just 1 question....WHY!!!!!?
If this video taught me anything it's to never give up. If you really have a vision and a goal that you believe in you will keep trying and trying despite the failures.
Mark rober has nothing on this guy
God this brang back so many Unus Annus memories. PAINNNN
No sound like him
fucking imagine that electricity bill. Sheeesh
This is why I pay for internet
missed out on a water cooled chicken slapper.
_Inspirational_
Didn't it have to cook at 60 for and hour? You cooked it at 40-60 for idk how long but I think it had to be longer?
New term: Slap Depth
Bruh polish guy typing jebać disa on chat xD
I remember people asking if you could cook a chicken with a slap and I was like that’s stupid. I’d love to see someone do it though. You ask and thou shal receive
We are witnessing a marvel in modern scientific achievement.
The scale you use for real science is Kelvin. Not degree Celsius. But it's fine. At least not Fahrenheit or shit like that. Anyway funny video 😂😂
When people tell you not to choke your chicken so you start slapping it instead.
My family: Bring cooked steak for thanksgiving tomorrow.  College me without a stove:
We now know how hard you need to hit a chicken to cook it, someone contact TheRussianBadger
Meatbeater 9000 lol 😂! Aaah 😅😂🤣🥲 aaaah 9001 lol 😂 !
9:22 Jebać disa XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
I bet Rich people would pay serious money to eat slapped cooked chicken wether it was good or not. Copyright that shit and start a restaurant
The meat beater lol
The event of the year, and I'm not talking about the vaccine
1:05 lol heheheheh
We just kept slapping away
The only man that can beat his meat on YouTube and not get demonitized
i have an idea to make the chicken slapper better... use a real chicken
Meat Beater 9000 will go down in history
The humorous care invariably serve because liquor structurally disappear including a grotesque fibre. squealing, truthful move
Damn, a lot of "Jebać Disa" at 9:20. Im kinda impressed.
Wait til Gordon Ramsay sees this
According to my math, it would take 216,000 calories to cook the chicken.  To calculate energy expenditure from watt hours:  Watts per hour x 3.6 x # of hours = Energy expended Therefore: 7,500 watts per hour x 3.6 = 27,000 x 8 hours = 216,000 calories expended!  This means that since an average chicken contains about ~1,037 calories, you would be in a 214,963 calorie deficit(without taking in BMR, or the addition of eating any other food while slapping the chicken).  Because one pound of fat is about 3,500 calories, you would lose about ~61.4 pounds of fat from just slapping the chicken alone.   Why do weight watchers or keto when you could just slap a chicken 135,000 times???  Have a great day👍
I don't know why but I feel like this man is haunted by the ghost of Diogenes
9:25 xDDD JD JD JD polska gurom
This editing style feels like Doug Doug
You deserve the dislike for using a plastic knife and fork
Hey since you tenderized the fuck out of the steak of you get a similar sized cut of pork you might be able to make some really really rigged pulled pork maybe?
Louis Weisz: cooked chicken by slapping it. Asian parents: is my kid a chicken.
I'm confused why people are saying Celcius is the scientific one, when it's Kelvin
The hollow march literally pop because commission pathologically tease inside a mature linda. ambiguous, heady actress
Should have just hired Vasily Kamotsky. Mans slaps a chicken once and its at 75°C
*Many chickens were harmed in the making of this video
Interesting , very interesting. Well done.
Gross
,,Slap that c*ck" has reached a new area of meanings 😂😂😂 P.S. greetings from germany 😃
This is so beautiful but strange at the same time, why-
All th  boy are jealous
Damn
Puberty  You looking for some new form to *@:+%× yourself
How do you like your meat to be cooked sir ? Me : slapped .
Mark Robert v 2
I’m so glad this finally worked
You need to post more dude
😆Physicists' like : Why are  you using a so inefficient way to confirm the thing we already know, mechanical energy can convert to thermal energy! (This is just joking😂)
this brought a whole new meaning to beating meat
9:21 o nawet Polacy tutaj byli xDDDD
the future bruh
If grouse could see this now
This is what humanity become
Davie would be delighted to see this.  ಡ ͜ ʖ ಡ
You just hit a dead body of someone. A being killed for your fun. This is not funny.  This is disgusting and disturbing to see. Animals don't deserve to be treated like food.  They want to live as much as you do. Make a change. Be good. Let them live their lives. 😥😭
Great job 😄
The *meat beater*       I'm dieing LMAO
2021 hit hard
“I’m just saying, if physical energy can be turned into thermal energy, how hard would I have to punch a chicken to come it?”       -JelloPuddin
This video slaps
Waited months in curiosity. Learned adjustable slap rate.
Mark rober wannabe
Americans: What is 60°? Too cold..
When you told me your project this month was to stay at home and beat your meat, I didn’t believe you at first.
*Mark Rober music starts playing* All right this is getting serious
most interesting thing ive seen this week
Still gotta eat it...
watch this guy make one so fast it goes from a raw chicken to a burnt chicken
The plastic cutlery - heathen
Finally😌!!!
wow
Whats the song name at 00:06 to 00:39?
I've been so invested in this since i saw the first video omg
the heck is with the music are you the next Mark rober
"So what stage are you at in your pandemic isolation?" "I've been doing more cooking projects. How about you?"  "Ummm...Me too."
So that's how many slaps it took! This man here is doing [REDACTED]'s work.
I thought I was having a stroke when I read the title
We can all say that he did indeed, beat the fuck outta his meat
Making ya self fool by cooking a chicken through slaping? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Marshall Eriksen approves this video.
And I was created
Finally
You should be with mark rober bud
You should have seasoned the steak before putting the n the slapper then it would taste better
The west is dying btw...
mark rober but sillier and younger
I urge you to think twice before beating your meat this much.
As a black man...contrary to popular belief I've always preferred my chicken rather slapped than fried
Why don’t you use a sterling engine and make it really hot?
Can I cook you?
Mark Rober got a challenger
my girlfriend beats and eats my meat with lower temperature
I have subscribed just because he called it a Blowy-matron.
We're so proud of you buddy
I'd just like to point out that I stumbled into your original video YouTube style, and was watching a video about people cutting fishing lines and things off seals in Namibia when I saw this in my recommends and literally said out loud in amused disbelief, "You fucking did NOT" xD and of course now here I am!
im so proud to have been following this since concept :). humanity's chicken domination how now reached 101%.
Never met somebody who ate prechewed meat and said, "if you can look past that, its actually pretty good"
Not sure how many people watching this will notice but this dude is a mars yard wear tester??? That's sick
What a good video to help me find this awesome channel
Polyend drum beaters could work well as a way to slap/beat the chicken while controlling speed and force
Slapping machine: SPANKK DAAT ASSS!   Chicken: STOPP STOPP!
You’re like a gen z Adam Savage
lol the original meat beater 🤣 1:05
beat that meat man
I mean cooking isn't just about depasteurization, the main thing that gives cooked things their flavor is denaturing the proteins, which usually has a pretty particular range. Though idk maybe the proteins are already done for well below 165
This is why you study engineering on college
my question is did we cook it medium rare imo: not cooked cause this thing cant fully cook ?
Just put the damn chicken in the oven .
You earned this sub right here!
MEAT BEATER !!! THIS GUYS LOVES SLAPPING MEAT😂😂😂
Put it in an oven and then turn the oven on while the slap machine is going
This is what mankind did before we discovered fire. Know your roots people
Waiter: How would you like your steak? Me: Slapped
music still reminding me of mark rober
cook it by punching next.
This video slaps.
You better like this video
Just start a channel called slap cooking
Finally guys, Heavenlys Question is answered!!! Madlad did it
Guga will take this as a challenge I hope your aware
Still a fail. Nice try bub..
I love that this started as a tumblr shit post
Slap dat meat !
Here I am, just scrolling through youtube, and the algorithm asks how many slaps it takes to cook a chicken. How could I resist? This is the kind of mad scientist cooking that should require a collab with Alex (french guy cooking).
;)
Can my man please just say Celsius instead of “c”
1:05 😈
My wifes nickname is the MeatBeater 9000.
atömic rööster höw did you come up with that ^ ^
His meat beater 9001 looks different than mines
I need Davie504...now!
Someone please send this to Gordon Ramsay.
POV recommendation: We don’t care.
Same music as mark rober and same talking style...love it
Did I just stumble across a Mark Rober video? A LOT of similarities in the production etc.
So what you're telling me is my oven is only 3x more efficient than a chicken slapping machine??
It's time to call for Davie504 (☞ ಠ_ಠ)☞
My recommendations are questionable
Why do you have mark robers music?
This is just simply god tier science
Send this to Davie504!
He used one of the songs that Mark Rober uses.  Just saying.
Alright let’s eat it🤤
8:17: My immaturity: pfff meat beater lol L
Imagine being a chicken and getting killed just to get slapped 135,000 times
He... he did it. He actually did it.
Davie504 would approve this
I mean, I don't think it would've been that hard to leave the meat there for like 2 minutes longer so you didn't end up eating raw meat, but cool video.
With that many slaps the chicken became a cream.
You actually found a way to physically abuse bacteria, now if we could only get rid of all harmful bacteria by slapping it senseless.  Seriously though, this has to be the slowest most brutal way to kill bacteria.  Not sure why youtube wanted me to watch a chicken slapping vid, but I'm not disappointed.
Mmm. So to note. If it took Over 4 hours to reach the 135°F mark your food will be Quite poisonous due to bacteria generated toxins :)
I'm glad my parents didnt have this when I was younger
You did it. You crazy son of a nice woman you did it(we are family friendly)
man i wish i had this much free time lmao
Say Hello to Salmonella 😅😅😅
*nooo why did you cook my friend*
I cooked a chicken by ripping cheeks on it. It was hot I used it for a family reunion.
We need a bike powered meat beater
i still remember watching the original video and thinking that he had no chance to make this work XD
“Original meat beater” 😭😭😭😭
only halfway through but this is a master piece of a video.
the meater beater
December 1st:
Alternative title Beating meat untill it cooks
F
Now, for the real test. How would one do this, but with one, single ungodly powerful slap that somehow keeps the chicken intact?
man... i actually want to try that steak and chicken
I can only wish to have such passion for something that I just won't give up. You are an inspiration to many.
Pathetic.  A real man would do this by hand.
Lol this was one of the thermodynamic exercises on my exam, never thought it would genuinly work haha
No way
This BDSM is getting out of hand
That steak was probably Tenderized beyond comprehension
Once you hear “meat beater” you can’t unhear it... 😂
Moms takeing notes
Texture was like that probably because of how tenderized it was due to the slaps
You can finally say you were the first person in the world to cook a chickens by slpas. Well done
i am so fucking hungry and that size of meat is just a dream for me lmao can't afford i'm broke
"The original meat beater"  🍆✊🏽       👀
Waiter: How would you like your steak, sir?: medium, 3/4 or entire?  Me:   S   L   A   P
"The original meat beater had a problem." Same buddy, same.
I love everything about this
Davie504: *cries in slap*
I don’t know if someone has said it yet. But put a flesh-light on the end of that and replace the chicken...with something else
In another parallel universe this is the conventional way of cooking  chicken
This man is a hero among chefs
davie504:is it possible to learn this power
That was the most pointless bit of Engineering bullshit I've ever watched.  Nice.
Did somebody tell Davie504 about this?
Real scientists measure in K, not °C
Bro... as a vegan..this is Just... Still Watched the whole video tho
Walmart Mark Rober
Alright, step 2. Make a slapping chicken restaurant. You wont
Stevie504 has entered the chat
Are you gonna try choking it next?
No spices tho bruh?
His style reminds me like another YouTubers style 🤔 he’s kinda sus
This is revolutionary! Look out Thanksgiving I’m slapping a turkey 🦃
I wouldn't consider hitting the bare minimum to pasteurize the chicken a success.  Things don't heat evenly when they have bones in them.  Had you eaten that chicken, you would have gotten sick 100%
Imma go beat my meat at home.  ppl: eW wHaT a WeIrDo.  What I really meant:
wait a minute this isn't Michael Reeves
I hear that Mark Rober music 😂
9:21 nice Poland guy that says Fuck Dis (our ytber)
Who is this? Dorky Mark Rober? Nice 👌
6:39 "It's time to slap some freaking meat!"  Well, whatever turns you on, I guess... 😆
What's with the Mark Rober wannabe music?
“I cooked a chicken by slapping it”  4,765,148 people: *interesting*
Shit slaps bro
9:21 jebać xD
I'm glad my meat isn't getting cooked after beating it 10 times everyday. The temperature isn't even going up
Ah, Julia Child was onto something when she would pat meat before cooking it
Hey uhh I wonder how the chickens used to do this and how he felt
where is Gouga at
"OPE"  THAT PERSON IS FROM THE MIDWEST.
I feel I learned something. I don’t know what exactly but I did
Why is this a thing.
oh shit you did it!!!!
Ever thought about this? You are probably the first person in human history who ate a slapp-cooked piece of meat.
should have welded er up
Im genuinely amazed
This is the kind of stuff nobody asked for but everyone needed
The ending was very anti climatic you should have done it again without it being rushed and eat it
Oh god this was an actual video
Have you considered repurposing that slapper for Battlebots? 🤔
congrats, you beat your meat.
I was so disappointed when I thought you couldn't cook a chicken (after your last chicken slapping video). I'm now very happy to know you cooked the chicken.
hmmmm how to cook a chicken intellectually
Hey i didn't search for this, it just came up on my recommend, click it anyway xD
Now do it with real chicken
Why I hear voice of pianta?
Is this beating your meat?
Thatveganteacher is pissed lol
please share the music name in 7:47
the only thing he can and ever will accomplish in his life.... beating his meat
Now slap some ham
That’s right *beat that meat*
Future generations are gonna look back at this and will be in the history books
This is old school youtube content I miss
“Im just saying, if Physical Energy can be converted into Thermal Energy, How hard would I have to punch a chicken to cook it?” -Jello
He changed the thumbnail
Of all the foodstuffs to trial this with, you picked one with a high chance of salmonella should it be underdone? 😂
Jesus Christ this is epic
When louis realizes he can yous a pan
so about 3x the energy cost and at least 6x the time cost compared to using an oven to bake (using your energy statement, and the 6-8 hours, and 15 minutes to heat oven to 350 degrees, and 30 minutes to cook chicken.  and developing your own technology rather than buying an oven.  ... and getting this process to be automated at all requires electricty, while feeding a fire for an oven is a lot less work, and means that you only spend human energy on moving the fuel.
Always wanted to know if it was possible, now I do.
I was in this video I was “the meat beater 9001” who was slapping the chicken
You should try seasoning it while cooking it 👀
I want to see Mr beast do this with his own two hands
People just be uploading anything 😂
therussianbadger would be proud

he fucking wrecked that bird, how does he expect it to taste eatable?
is it more efficient than using a stove

That chicken isn't cooked :/ did you get sick after eating some. 78 degrees Celsius
2021 Nobel Prize Nomination
This made my brain mega smooth
Great video. Fascinating and really well executed. Thank you. So it's not possible to slap a chicken and cook it unless you have an aerogel bag? Oh well... Then again who'd want to watch a video if you put that in the title ;)
that chick was not cooked just no where near the safe temp to even store a cooked chicken
Thats why you lube you chicken before you slap it....
NO WAY

Me casually watching how to cook a chicken 5 am in the morning.
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Bruh he got that mark rober music
Davie likes it
This is the future old man
Using those Mark Rober tunes😏
All of us are sitting here watching him beat his meat
He called it a meat beater
what's the song though
Someone send this to davie
FINALLY SOMEONE DID IT
That music along with the content makes me remember Mark Robber
I’m only 3:30 in but I hope he figures out that he needs a sleeve for that bolt.
K...next up is cooking a turkey. Get to work.
Hey, sweetie! My family and I watched you're original video on this and were happily surprised to see this video posted! I'm glad you did it, congratulations! 🥳
Unus???
If you take this out of context it sounds weird  “Meat beater”
U are using mark robers backround song
the things you do with your free time...
F
Weld up a rig my guy
12:13 sees ricecooker * happy asian noises *
Why aren’t you using a wheel design to provide the slaps? Seems like the main problem you had was the impact from the arm going up and down. Seems like you could get more efficient slaps if you hung up the chicken like a speed bag, and basically made a small wagon wheel with extended pads, they would deliver slap after slap Rocky style.
Do a fish next
Slapped that chicken so hard, its DNA felt it
They say not all things are impossible. It was impossible at first, but we have finally done it.
Yes!!!!! Omg I have been dreaming of this day
Chicken abuse

I don't know if this is a myth or not, but didn't Mongolian Riders put raw meat under their saddle to "cook" it during riding?
This guy is literally  beating his meat on youtube.

Mom: How do u want your chicken? Me: Slapped
next time just season it lol
Bro are u like the sequel to beakman's world i will gladly sub + turn noti keep up the wacky work 🙃
lol, Kelvin is true scientific measurement of temperature. Yes, I know that you just have to add 273.15 to Celsius.
This man not only uses the same song as Mark Rober. He also talks like him,
"I'm just sayin, if physical can be turned into thermal energy"...  *H o w  h a r d  w o u l d  I  h a v e  t o  p u n c h  a  c h i c k e n  t o  c o o k  i t?* Jello 2018
This low key the funniest shit I’ve seen for ages.
The tiny dentist scientifically stamp because mascara mathematically undress above a garrulous intestine. courageous, loud trousers
Maybe could have put meat in a paint can and shake it (like they mix paint)
Vegan nightmare 😂
ppl dumb, real science’s measurements are kelvin🥸
Question.... can @davie504 cook a chicken? OR... can he cook his BASS?
Adds a new meaning to the phrase "Beating your meat" xD
I'm guessing this video was suggested for me because I also enjoyed watching video of Japanese bees using only themselves to surround, cover, and actually bake a Murder-Hornet.  :)   (great suggestion, I loved it! Slap on!)
If i was in the days before fire invented nd knew bout this      Id still eat it raw
So my entire life my mom has been cooking me???
THAT CHICKEN IS STILL BLEEDING YOU DOUNUT!!!!!!!
I'm gonna go spill the juice in the other room. Nice.
So cooking via the heat from friction? Thats fucking wild bro lmfao

See if your friend can brack a slabe?
THE MOOOSSST IMPORTANT MILESTONE AHHAHHHA 🤣🤣🤣

It's stuff like this that makes me realise that the Anthropocene hasn't been a total failure for the planet.
White ppl be doing eveything expect seasoning their chicken...
2:17 ...or you could use Kelvin like an extra-real scientist!
Honestly....    *the texture is kinda shit*
Gross. Celsius. Real science uses Kelvin you savages.
WOW, new sub here.
Bu can you rub a chicken to cook it
Can you give me it with a hand?
I'm surprised the chicken 🐔 didn't come back to life 🙃
I don't know where I'm I don't know who you are I don't know why this video was recommend to me All i know is that I must watch it.
When you order mark rover off wish
NO WAY he actually did it after getting the other video in my recommended randomly.
Your vid came to my recommendations and it is not years old.+ I am vegan LOL
Oh shit he made it the mad lad!!
Davie504 is the only human able to slap chicken till its cooked
Was it seasoned?
Dude is literally being his meat
As a vegan I must say that this is both cruel and beautiful at once.
I'd be curious to know how good a steak can be cooked like that, but then seared afterwards. But maybe I've been watching too much of Guga / Sous Vide Everything! It'd be hilarious if you could get him involved in a video tbh
This video: Exists   Me: Proceeds to post angry comment on Bon Appetit’s “Every way to cook a whole chicken” video
Jeez he really did beat his meat
Brainiac, you are amazing.
Mark rober feel
No seasoning? No wonder it smelt like shit
so thats why my chicken heats up when im cho...uh...slapping it.

Brings a whole new meaning to beating your meat
Slaps or spanks on that chicken...?
I feel like I've seen you somewhere...
Are you using the same video cutting guy as Mark Rober or is that music just a cheap background sound?
Lol
"the original meat beater"..... What did he saaaaaaay?
I find it disgusting. It was a living being.
the ''slap-you-so-hard-you-could-cook-chicken'' INATOR
Let’s just say... I’m not disappointed But... I’m just curious what went through your mind when doing this
An Indian Mum would have had that chicken cooked after one bad exam in a few minutes.
Stronger arm 0:57 meat beater 1:04
You have to make a restaurant called slappers and all of the food is cooked by slaps.
but at what cost
Unus Annus Would be proud
The Slap Chop guy is going to be soo envious.
You should've called this "Torturing Chickens For 13 Minutes and 16 Seconds".

so this is why my pp burns?

When you realize he got the Mark Rober background music.
Fake
imagine being one of those chickens and dying just so a dude can try to find out how many slaps it takes to cook you
The algorithm has brought us all here together once again.
I never thought I would watch a dude beat his meat for this long

That’s why all my homies cheeks are always 60 degrees C
Yoo what about *friction* cooked chicken?    The material gets hotter faster than just slapping it and it may not use that much energy in the long run
I clapped so much it cooked my hands.
I heard he died of Salmonella poisoning
So if i train myself to slap that fast i wouldnt need a frying pan.
“Its time to slap some freaking meat” nice

Energy can cook food.  Who knew?  Great job, but far too much free time on your hands.
The man has done it. We finally have technology to eat food that is slap-cooked
At first the first disign I noticed the arm was hitting the floor and the wood, make the holder higher.
Boutta cook my girlfriend...
I lost it at meatbeater
Im gonna slap my chicken when i get home :)
Adding holes in the slapper to make it slightly porous would probably increase the scalability of the slap strength because it would increase the aerodynamics
jebać Disa in stream chat, I'm kinda proud
ahahaha, this is amazing, i cried my eyes out
At least the meet was nice and tender
I didint know mark Rober had a 2nd channel!
Where's @Davie504 on all of this
"I'm just sayin if Kinetic Energy can be converted to Thermal Energy, how hard do I need to punch a chicken to cook it"
When no one. Asked he did it anyway a true good person
Somebody call davey504

This is a new and inviting idea for a video and style, cough cough mark robe cough cough mrbro

Mark Robbrr reborn
At uni me and my friends wondered whether it would be possible to cook a chicken by screaming at it (or rather how long that would take if it didn’t lose heat energy), I haven’t thought about that for like 12 years.
@Gugafoods
For forever now you're gonna be called the meat beater.
You're a genius inventor.
9:22 jd
Humans in 2050 be using this invention this madlad made.
wait so did he cook it or not?
Doesn't a chicken need to be cooked at 180c, not 60c?
9:21 JEBAC DISA XDDDD
This isn't the only one in the world to be cooked by slaps. Not even the first. The Hacksmith did it first with a rocket powered slap.
wondering if anybody thought of doing it with a single slapping wheel with 3-4 slapping "hands" attached directly to a motor, hands would obviously be loose hinged slappers to allowed them slap the chicken but get out of the way to allow them to pass by and so on and so on and so on and so on. slappers could be made of some kinda heavy duty rubber or something along those lines so they could flex on impact. in my head that'd be one way to potentially increase the slap frequency and lessens the complexity of the contraption so in theory less stuff could go wrong too.
This guy is going places   Idfk where but he’s going
Anybody else notice hes using the mark rober music?
He really just took a meme and ran with it

Dude!! This is awesome. I thought after that first video this idea was scrapped I’m so glad to see it achieved.
How many turkey slaps does it take to cook a turkey
Someone: can i get some steak? Waiter: sure it sould br ready is about 65,000 slaps
My problem here is that the bag has been opened off camera and the meat doesn’t look like it was beat for 90 min. But well, I guess he spent a lot of time doing this.
1:53 is kinda sus ngl

I think a year or two ago, I read an article, which was trying to argue just how impossible this is in practicality... Yet here it is, a chicken slapped to a safe to eat state.
I’m sure this chicken is looking on its body in heaven and appreciating its contribution to society

You should probably rotate the chicken every once in a while so it doesn’t get ultra beat in one spot
Why am i here? Its the middle of the night and its school tomorrow!
Expected a reaction of "this shit slaps"
No but this could be a torture device in like the 40s? 😭
Bruh the algorithm decided I needed to sew chicken slapping and honestly I've never felt more called out. Definitely what I needed before work, thank you chicken slapper man
Wanna know why the meat gets hot?   Because it is still part of an organism that reacts to anything. Imagine your hands and start clapping. You don't need to do that if you already know what happens when you do that. After a minute or more you'll start to feel your palms getting pretty warm. But because it also starts to hurt you might want to discontinue your clapping. That is at least the signal your brain will send you in regard of this matter. Now imagine you cut off one of your hands put it on the table and start slapping it with whatever is available. Since it is no longer a part of your body you won't mind the hand hurting because you don't feel it anymore. Thus you can clap/slap as much and as fast as you want which will result in higher temperature within the hand. Because the muscle tissue is "working" and there is no impuls to stop whatever is happening because you cut your hand off earlier which ultimately allows you to "coock" your hand as far as it physically allows you to. If you still don't know why the meat will go warmer and warmer then remember your last exercise and how you got warm during training or running. Pretty much the same idea.   So basically what happened with the chicken was that it got "overexercised" to the extent where it coocked itself. Yummy idea :)
That JD bomb tho
What would happen if a 135,000 people slapped a chicken at once, Theoretically? Obviously surface area would be a big factor, but how much kinetic energy would be transferred to heat on "one good shot"
I wouldn’t normally watch a guy slap his chicken or whack his meat or beat his steak but this is fucking sick.
Lol rip
Why not use a spring on the slapping side of the slapper? All that weight is on one end, the the motor and mechanism is going through continual stress. There will be some rebound from the meat itself, but a spring installed may help push the slapper back up.
This isn't slaps
And this kids who write jeb## disa

we also cook chicken cause you know... it... tastes... better... Right?

Friction in atoms from spanking the chicken aw shit!
No chicken were harmed in this video

I just slapped my chicken too.
We did it bois
The blood that came out the steak made me cringe 😬
You have ugly fingers
oh my god he did it
wow that's sick.
that thing would make a perfect schnitzel
This is the most extraordinary thing I have seen this year, you my man are a genius. Very soon I have hope we will be breaking free of microwaves soon

But, why?
I still would not eat that....
Nice
Ah yes the age old question: can I eat this animal if I slap it enough?
Imagine the sex toys this guy could manufacture for us men.
Curious as to why you did not mount flexible slappers to a wheel rather than using the see saw mechanism?
Remember me when it is recommended in 3 years.
0:57 when the music kicked in I thought I'm on @MarkRober chanel for a second
I tried this with my girlfriend last night. It was a lot of work be she was cooked to perfection.
1. You have the same speech pattern as Mark Rober 2. You have the same background music as Mark Rober 3. You have the same type of development and explanation of your video as Mark Rober
We will watch your career with great interest
Mark Rober vibes in this vid, not a bad inspiration tho
Imagine graduating engineering in college just to make a chicken slapper, such a legend 😎
Gordon Ramsey is losing his mind right now. I can imagine plates flying across the kitchen. “A FUCKING IDIOT ON THE INTERNET COOKED A STEAK BY FUCKING SLAPPING IT YET YOU CAN EVEN COOK A STEAK IN A PAN” 😂😂😂
9:20 only people from poland gonna know what happend on chat xd

So if I beat my meat long enough, I can cook myself😭😂
How about like a 100 or so people on  A conveyor belt

best part of this chicken is its not burnd ,grillrd or nuked. just clean
This is the start of the second renaissance

This guy is the inbetween Mark Rober and Micheal Reeves
Are you cutting a steak with plastic utensils? Heathen
I would like to see your proof that it's never done before...
This is exactly how white mothers cook chickens
Maybe slap the steak a bit longer
u know this was a desprate attempt to cook chicken  not for science  =) if he used a little more brain power u couldof just nad a massive wheel with spokes with rubber strips so u can slap those brest 8 times a spin.
Someone get Ethan and Mark to collab with this guy

this is beating meat on a whole new level

you did not really do this lmao
I'm going to report this, who wants to see a guy sit around an beat his meat all the time?
Bro don't use the mark rober music his videos are cringe be original
Why does he call it the meat beater
THANK GOD! I WAS WORRIED U WOULNT CONTINUE WITH THIS PROJECT

You did it, you crazy son of a gun, you did it
Wow
You could just put the chicken in the oven 🤔
now this is what i call a life hack.
No one:  YouTube : wanna see someone slapping the hell out of a chicken?
UR GOING TO EAT IT
One day I will surround myself with friends like you :)
Its fake, the chicken is a paid actor
One small step for man One giant leap for meme kind.
Incredible and very interesting feat of engineering, but your livestream persona is just very uninteresting.  Updoot for the content and I hope you do well in future videos!
No man has ever walked on the moon using the metric system
Imagine this thing slapping your ass, red ass
Any dude who slaps chickens deserves my sub
This is the same vid with a different thumbnail?
Epic
Okay you cooked a chicken with thousands slaps but i can roast my little brother with 1 slap only
That a stake and u said Chicken
why didnt u used like a wheel, an spiral slapper, kinda an asterisk fan with a plastic slappers band in each edge of the asterisk to hit the chickend more times and much faster
Don’t get me wrong this is really cool, but why use the same music as Mark Rober? Makes it kinda copy cat :)
It smells like shhhhhhhhhh🤣
Fake 'n' gay
Fuking legend
Someone tag Russian Badger on this
As a YouTube addict I thought that I had seen everything.  Boy, was I wrong.

OMG my physics teacher has this motto that he's put in his room saying " slap chicken at 3725.95 mph to cook."
What if you bombarded the chicken with microwave radiation? The water atoms in the chicken would rub together creating friction and heat.

When Gordon Ramsay slaps beef instead of people faces:
Budget mark rober lol
You would have better luck cooking it by putting it on the motor.
this dude is just rip off of Mark Rober he even has the same music._.
mark rober on crack
i was watching football videos and then all of a sudden i am here!    How did this happen?
Finally it done   Slapping Ze chicken until it cooked
why you didn't make a big wheel with a lot of hands? I think it's more resistent.
For some reason this reminds me of what Jello said in a RussianBadger video "If physical energy can be turn into thermal energy,how hard would I have to punch a chicken to cook it".
No idea what im doing wrong... i beat my meat atleast 150k times, but its still only 37°...
not real!!!!!!!!! el ne higyétek

This is what happens when you dont have money for an oven
I don’t pay much attention how memes develop but I remember this one and one thing I’m curious is how much energy did you use to cook the chicken? I remember the math was all about energy conversion.
You are a madlad
wrong Wrong WRONG!  Science does not care if it's degrees F or C F is much gooder because of FINER increments

Can't imagine getting slapped like that
This feels like a scuffed Mark Rober Video
Crack team?
i clicked so fast lol
Partner with Guga Foods on making slap-vide steaks
Bro this video gonna get viral. Expecting at least 50million view
My teacher : u dum Me : understands what science man
Upgrade it more
Nice Rice Cooker Buddy.
When you realize this is the same music from Mark Rober
History is made
You finally did it!
11:55 a chat full of Polish swears...   *i have lost faith in humanity*
Why the... what the... just.... huh?
Local Man, Beats his Meat. More at Eleven.
That Vegan Teacher: *raging in the background*
Interessting
He fucking did it!
*_Epic gamer moment_*
You literally cooked a steak with slaps
I'm grateful that I was alive for this moment
Thanksgiving Dinner Gonna Take A bit.......longer now
It really shows how product R&D is costly and time consuming.
* me waiting for Micheal reeves trying to recreate this*
I winder wat gorden ramsey think about this-
Anyone else getting Unus Annus flashbacks?
1:55 😳
Grab me that MEAT BEATER 9001 😳
Thank god humans discovered fire
1:02 VIRGIN TREE BEATS HIS MEAT Edit: Can i make a restaraunt and the whole idea would be kinetic meat? (Dont sue me)
Bringing a new meaning to beating the meat
Now this is what you call beating meat
The bacteria in that chicken like  "mf boil and kill me already you psychopath" 😭
One small bite for man, one large bite for man kind
So sick u got the mars yards from the challenge
To bad you can't eat your chicken after a slap porn party,just the juice.
Imagine 2 arms taking turn whipping the chicken...
*Meat* *Beater* *2021*
POLSKA GUROM
Beating his meat. Literally
to make it better and being able to heat it up faster put a cpu without a fan lol
You should team up with mark rober
MANS IS CUTTING STEAK WITH A PLASTIC BUTTER KNIFES
Slapper: what is my purpose  Louis: HIT CHICKEN UNTIL HOT
Nawet tutaj jebia disa
Is this how cave men cooked meat before fire just slapping it with a club
Boi, giv me that machine, lord hav murthy

SLAP THAT CHICKEEENNN
Pictured: Star Platinum cooks a chicken 1987 colorized
And here's the paper which is cited: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yL_-1d9OSdk
Beautiful. A resolution to this pressing issue at last
10:40 he sounds so much like Sokka from atla😂
I can't believe people like this exist.
9:25 "jebać disa" XDDDDD
First time I subscribe just by reading a title
Thousands of centuries, MILLIONS of years of technological evolution, just to cook a goddamn chicken by slapping it. Not that I disprove of this method of cooking, though.
Did anyone tag davie504
11:55 polska gurom BloodTrail
9:21 Spójrzcie na czat -_-
chicken is safe to eat at 75c
Could probably make a few _adjustments_ for a more “interesting” device 👀
1921: We'll have flying cars in 100 years!  2021: We can now cook a chicken by slapping it.
you should receive a Ph.D for this
11:55 jd moment xD Pozdrawiam disa 🤷🏿‍♂️
So.....this would be a bad idea for a hand job...good to know
Elliptical motion. Flexible slap surface. And don't eat aerojel. So good, and try a bag of rice water for the slapper pad, and elliptical so you can control the force with the modulation of the electrical input, it should just shake the bag.
For some reason, I heard him say "I was reasonably autistic about our avian alternative."
FAKE!!!
GG
unus annus would be proud😌
I watched this video and i thought he was gonna drag everything out but damn this was a good quality video
Unus Annus UNUS ANNUS UNUS! ANNUS!
I find it funny how this has more horsepower than most early cars.
#markrober2.0
Hmmmm🤔 i have doubts if this is real
Congratulations, you built a waveoven. The Microwave does exactly the same thing, just much much faster, enclosed to prevent heat loss. I must say, it's actually impressive. Personally I would have made a slapper with a speaker magnet, since it could control both power and speed and is built for continuous use.
Witnessing history in the making
Has he not thought of throwing some spices or seasoning on the chicken before he starts cooking it?
Oh the songs remind me of mark rober
Im geting Unus Annus vibes lol
Real science uses Kelvin😂
me love meat
finally i have to no longer put my chicken in the oven i can just slap it
0:56 I will now call you mini mark
Russian badger joins the chat*
Clickbait
slap inator that's all I will say
No one:  *Cavemen before the fire was invented:*
He could probably make a company out of this and get rich
Chat:Jebać disa XD
Can you light up a room by rubbing a hand on the inside of a sleeping bag to create static?
JEBAĆ DISA NA CZACIE XDDDD 9:25
This is Davie504's dream come true.
Hello salmonella
me 2 mins after my family leaves home   1:56
Did he said original meat beater?
me: chillin’ youtube: hey this guy cooked a chicken by slapping it also me: the fk?
9:21 mielonka, come on... Za to można dostać bana
I don't know how I came here, but I'm glad i did.
Youtube reccomendations are forgiven for all their sins for this
Thats why my friend says thats His Ding Ding is very hot
Doesnt chicken have to reach a min of 165 degrees F in order to be considered cooked?
Mark rover finally is out of smart for a while...
"I wanted to eat a meal cooked by a power of slaps"  *Davie504 entered the chat* 7:49
How does this actually work and cook the chicken 😂
I think technology has peaked at this point
“Meat beater”
4 million views in 3 days
CHICKEN
Balian.
The original meat beater... hahaha
7:46 when i heard Mattie Maguire's Racing Hearts I just knew that the machine would work.
Finely some good contant
mark rober 2.0
I can only imagine how you came up with this question on  h o w
9:21 "Jebać Disa" Lmaoooo
3:52 "slap me harder Louise" in chat lol
Wow, that steak SLAPS
i don't want to sound rude - but i don't think you are using the word "engineering" correctly. You just fool around and try things out instead of doing even basic designing and - well - engineering before building a setup. Its a very entertaining video but i think some people may get the wrong concept of the field of engineering.
i cant belive you actually fucking did it holy shit good job man
as an experiment i think it would be much more entertaining to get like 200,000 people together to slap 1 chicken in the bag
Me when i try to cook:
I saw this on a meme and know this is real
But... Why?
This vid gives me Mark rober vibes 0-0.
Heston Blumenthal needs to call
im glad this was recamended to me
I couldn't watch more than 1 minute because of the music.
the cognitive dissonance is big in this one.
You remind me of Mr beast
lockdown has people slapping chickens
i thought i was watching a Mark Rober video
Omg this trend was finally hit! (Or should I say slap)
This is young Rick Sámchez. Morty's not born yet.
He actually did it HOLLLYYYY GOOD JOB
I love our gamer brains are just "just put a PC fan/heat sink on it"
The slapper isn't hand shaped, so this entire thing is void
i hope he at least seasoned the steak
This is the Rube Goldberg machine of thermodynamics.
Day 378 of pandemic:
The chicken be like: harder daddy 😩🥵
Image the faces of the vegans watching this 💀
They doubted.
me at 3am
The ideal thing would be making a gear so you can increase the speed by 2 but decrease the force it's being slapped
I remember something about punching a chicken from the russian badger.
The guy beating his meat with this: too hot
How to cook Chicken Google: Preheat oven to 350 F and then put the chicken on a tray and put it in the oven for 1 hour to cook.  Bing:
No one  wants to know how you  made the machine ,if you make a video about stupid stuff ,just show people the stupid stuff ,I don't think a real intellectual guy ( a guy who could actually understand whatever you said )would never watch a video about how you cooked the chicken by slapping it .
I love the “Guns Save Lives” sticker.
I waited for this video
9:22 poland is everywhere XDDDDD
The texture and chicken below 65 degrees is awful. Do not eat.
Everybody wanting an Air Fyer these days well I just want a Chicken Slapper
Jesus loves u which is why he suffered and died for ur sins so pls turn to him, he changed my life for the better and he can so the same for u if u accept him into ur heart and confess that he is ur lord and personal savior
Background music is the same as Mark Rober uses
This is taking beating your meat to a whole new level .
WE SLAPPED THE FUCK OUT OF A CHICKEN  _FOR SCIENCE!_
Gordon Ramsey has been dead silent since this came out
This is huge
Wait, he changed the thumbnail
THE MEAT BEATER 😤
How is that hello fresh is providing dead animals... as "fresh"
Man,there is a brazilian YouTube that did the same vídeo two weeks ago i think he stole your idea the name of his chanel is Balian
Gordan Ramsay will not approve this-
My uncle used to do this with me, only he didn't use a machine, and there was no chicken.
He has done it he did the meme
Woah
I lived during the perfect age to witness history
The amount of "jebać disa" is overwhelming
Wtf
So.. You'd need to eat 4,832 chickens to have the bodily energy to get the set up ready and actually cook a chicken?
Ancient people: We'll have flying cars by 2020  Louis in 2021: I'm going to cook the best slapped chicken
Mark Robert 2.0 but funnier ideas
What kind of a person uses montage music for the background
There’s an old saying “how many slaps does it take to cook a chicken?”? What does it mean?
Peak human evolution right there everything step has lead to this moment
When ur pc cooling device is a bag of snow
Meat Beater   This man has been waiting his whole life to name something this.
No seasoning? 🤔
No one:     Me:this is the next mark rober
Original Meat Beater 😂😂😂
Yeah he is really beating his meet
I’m here because of a Russian badger joke, any one else?
This is a wannabe mark rober
Davie 504 be like:
Show this to Davie504 !!!
Me- Mom can I have Mark Rober! Mom- We have Mark Rober at home Mark Rober at home----
He hit the stall cooking the steakno issue.
Bro chicken is cooked at 65 C
so many veiws but so little subscribers
Maybe someone above eats humans like we eat animals
So just completely copy what mark rober does, all the way down to the way he talks. Get original.
The best way to beat your meat and eat it
Next Projekt: cooking a chicken with a single slap.
Imagine if this becomes a trending in VIP restorants and they serve you "Slapped chicken with croissant"
You can say that he actually........      beat his meat lol
This guy took beaten ur meat to a whole new level
The name of this video it's so dumb I had to click it.
This feels like closure for unus annus
He has the Mark Rober background music
When you edit the thumbnail to make it look like you did it with an actual hand
Can you bake a cake putting the batter in that same bag?
9:22 chłop pisze jebać disa XD
@Xan404 guarda ce l'hanno fatta a farlo ahahhaha
Finishing what Unus Annus started...
We need Gordon Ramsay to see this lol
Meat_Beater2077
I had to pause the video a minute in after he said the original meat beater...I’m not proud of myself
Omg he has done it... finally
Enough internet for today.....
next: cooking a chicken by blowing on it
Would be easier to invite Davie504 to slap chicken
Come on... Davie504 has to watch this... @Davie504
Copying mark robers music mm kinda sus
11:55 i to JD HAHAHHAHAHAHAHAH
Was just thinking to myself "Wow, all these youtube creators are starting to blur together, I'd swear that half that stuff looks just like projects I saw Peter Sripol make". Then Peter appeared and all was made clear.
The wonders of technology
we are watching someone beating their meat...
He took beating meat to a whole new level ⊙﹏⊙
Someone needs to go outside.
Who else herd Russian badger
9:20 xD Pozdro dla polaków
Balian?
The chicken in heaven : Tf are you doing to my corpse
How did you get 400k subs?!?!?! It was 50k last I saw
To point out you didn’t slap it o.o you basically hit it with a machine. Soooooo you used a machine to do it. Literally its not really possible by human hands sooooooooooo 🤷‍♂️
Hey uh, here’s an idea Make a machine that’s powered by its own heat
Medium rare is shit
Dude do it again thanksgiving time with a turkey!
I wonder what else you can it for
bro just put it in a oven, way simpler, trust me
once you put the chicken inside of an insolated pouch that holds in heat, you're shortcutting the problem. Now it's just an oven powered by slaps, which is less exciting.
*M* *E* *A* *T*   *B* *E* *A* *T* *E* *R*

Doc I think im sick... Doc: whats ur temp?? Me: 69420 Doc: Yes
And again, why have you done this?
you sir have gained a confused yet entertained subscriber.
#Davie504 is this Bass ?
What do I remember this music from...
Finally the answer I've been waiting for since one of RussianBadgers videos. Beautiful work
>:(
Just leaving this here before 5 million. Congrats Louis!
Your this bored with your life
The original meat beater   Ayo wtf
Aye I peep the palace and supreme. Louis you tryna cop some supreme lol, I got pleeenty still in original packaging never opened. All purchased with intent to resell 🤷‍♂️👌🤣
oh I’m in weird part of youtube again,hi there
RussianBadger would be happy
Meat beater 9001 servers us well
Collab with Davie504 and it'll take one slap
Yo that was not a chicken you put in there 100% diddnt even look like it lool fake
This is why YouTube
He literally beat his meat and then ate it
Next 10 years the oven will be replaced
Ah yes      Beating the meat
mark rober 2.0 ??!!!
If our species dies, they will find this.
I'm a vegan and Even I was curious at this lol
You could say he was “beating the meat”
What would say Gordon Ramsay?
Family: leaves house 13 year old me:
Wtf
Okay but can you cook a chicken in one slap if you hit it hard enough??
@Davie504
Well, that's a weird ass sous vide cooker.
oh
Man didnt even season it
This be how bored people are getting the pandemic lol
Why
We have reached the peak of human intelligence
Now it’s time to test on a live chicken
We’ve found the new Bill Nye. He is the science guy.
9:21 Jebac disa i chuj xd
What a waste of 13 minutes.. Give a shit what anyone says, none of that was cooked
While he's watching the chicken cook im reading the comments and there are SOME THINGS  wing said and I'm terrified
Soooooo, we did this too
jebac disa hahhahahaha nie wierze 9:25
You did it you crazy bastard. You did it
69420 42069 milestone?
He could have just made several rigs and added the slaps together.
He did it
Is it just me or does this seem like a Mark Rober video?
Keep in mind, a chicken died for this
What steak would you like?  Me: slapped steak
Someone send this to RussianBadger
The medival torture version of beating the meat
Ladies and gentlemen, we got him.
Disgusting
So with all those calculations in mind, what kind of force would be necessary to instantly cook the chicken in one, single slap? How fast, how hard, and can the chicken even feasibly be maintained at that point? Where my math geeks at, I need this info and I need it yesterday!!
Mark Robers son 💀
Get this to a Billion Views NOW
Finally you did it
everyone that says the steak “doesn’t look cooked” or doesn’t like pink in their steak: 🤡
Where are my fellow polishmen 9:20?
Lol the real scale used for science is kelvin..
When your girl ask for a spanking 9:19
I cooked a chicken by putting it in the oven
What if you use sound waves to vibrate the chicken and create friction inside of it.
You didn’t eat a chicken cooked by slapping, I consider this a failure
This is like waiting for a slow download
I'm Commander Shepard, and this is my favorite video on YouTube.
Ha....meat beater
Now the real fact:  *You need 135,000 slaps on a time of 6-8 hours to cook an entire chiken*
lmfao Kelvin is used in *science* not Celsius
real ones were here since the first episode
BRO WHAT
Fake
And that is how Davie504 cooks his food
This man took beating your meet to a whole new level 😳
11:56 JD kure
don't you just hate it when you get a big piece of chicken pulp in your salmonella juice
1:54
Imagine if in 10 years this proves to be the groundwork for warp drive.
okay how 10:06 and who is holding a fork like that.
Cook and tenderise at the same time
I came to the first video and promised myself will subscribe if i get another video and here i am subscribed 😂😂
I think @Davie504 would be proud
When your GF asks for slaps but you're a Jojo Character
so you didn't eat the mfing chicken!!! great feat anyway but no chicken no gainz
I NEVER IMAGINED A SEQUEL THAT WAS SUCCESSFUL, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
“Meat beater 9000”😐
He finally did it! The absolute mad man!!
BEAT THAT MEAT
Move over sous vide, it’s time for slaps vide
Meat beater😂 I know it's immature
Imagine being some nuclear physicist nerd who has spent most of his life getting his education and hopes to receive a Nobel prize someday while this Giga STEMChad builds a chicken spanking machine. A true Alpha male.
I like how this guy makes vids like mark rober but doesn’t steal from him 👍
Jebać disa - 9:25 im proud of my polish cousins XD
9:21 jebac disa na czacie
MEAT BEATER
YEAAAAAAA BEAT THAT MEAT
OMG- HE DID- HE DID THE THING!!!
The next mark rober
*Meat Beater*
I like ya cut g
meatbeater
One time my mom slapped me across the face so hard it felt like my cheek was on fire so in theory it will work. However she also slapped the taste out of my mouth so this method isn’t recommended for a good flavor profile.
Now try a live chicken
You could market this to old people as pre cooked steak
The new method of "Sous Vide" cooking, is now called "Slap Vide"!
*meat beater* 😳
So he made a meat beater
He called it the meat beater, *with batman voice* "I'm meat beater*
Imagine using that machine as a punishment for your children  HAHAHAHH
Is it possible to learn this power?
An old forgotten channel would be so proud. Memento Mori
Why am i hereee
congratulations.
Unus Annus Unus Annus Unus Annus
What they mean by robots will take over the world:
I..uh.um...ok?....;-;
Farenheit or Fake_baby
My husb used to like it like that! 😂😁
This takes “beating your meat” to another level.
Someone tell Davie504
Now you must hit the chicken so hard in one slap that it instantly cooks
Now that’s a man who knows how to beat his meat!
M e a t  b e a t e r
This is the way Sean Connery would've liked his chicken.
Cheers!
Omg he did what unus annus couldn't
Talk about beating your meat .
You've heard of SlapChop... now get ready
Davie504: OMG
Imagine this was just the way we cooked stuff normally, like you'd have a 2 star Michelin restaurant with a quiet, sophisticated ambience, and just in earshot, the constant rhythmic pounding of a chicken slapped to perfection in the kitchen.
F
Me after watching this : ORA ORA ORA *ORA*
4:10  What my parents said after I was born
What do you stream on? I'd love to be there live next time I can!
Salmonella maybe?.
Thats why i am paying for internet
This is what the internet was designed for
New challenge: Cook a Thanksgiving dinner with only slaps
I mean sure Celsius is used more in science but Fahrenheit is far superior in cooking as it's much more precise. You initially had the right measurements
Someone needs to show Gordan
This is better than answering, "which came first the chicken or the egg?".
He basically said “It tastes bad, but if you ignore that, it’s good.”
You should have went with a piston like design instead of an arm.
i think vegan don’t like this video, but i’m not shure😅
Bro just hire my mom she will cook a full course meal with just 1 slap
Yeoooo you’re a Nike WEARTESTER that’s so cool
9:27 to fajne Jebać disa
Glad to be a part of this from the beginning
omg it's a steak no way it look like steak  wow no way it taste like steak. MINDBLEWD
Poor chicken
I don't know why the YouTube algorithm brought me here, but this is the wholesome content that I needed today. I couldn't be happier.
I think u put a cooked steak in the bag and acted like u slap cooked it
DAMNNNNNNNNNNN , I AM IMPRESSED !
your just the bad person of mark rober
Dislikers needs to get slapped by the machine at 2000 rpm for 10 minutes.
What am I doing here. I got homework.
The issue is that you only measured the external temp of the chicken so it might not have been cooked on the inside
The engineer is engihere.
Plot twist: he replaced the steak with a cooked one when he walked through the door.
Ten spam jdXD
@balian
I call that beating the meat.
Bye bye gas lines, ovens. We got smarter
In the back of my mind: unus annUS, UNUS *ANNUS*
BTW hello fresh suck they forget ingredients EDIT:theyre usually £50! not even close to worth it if they did give you everything!
Mark Rober’s kid
Could you bind the steak and get it to maybe hold together better. I think like 20 pound fishing mono line wouldn’t snap
5800 vegans disliked this video
Your channel, content, personality, editing is practically ripped off of mark robers'. Try something original bud
Time to put the salt on the slapper
9:21 jebać disa na czacie
Humanity is doomed...
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOO
This guy needs to slow down with the adderral
Lmao you could’ve just used my hand to beat meat, I’ve been training for years and can definitely do better than your machine
Cries in unus annus
How dare you come at that steak with a plastic knife n fork!
next vid: how many slaps does it take to toast bread
With the music i feel like im watching mark rober
He's beating his meat
Polacy ale wstyd z tym jebac PiS na chacie
😅
yes PETA this one right here

‘Youtube algorithm is a pathway to that many videos some consider to be unnatural.’
young mark rober tbh
Mark Rober v2
Good for you bro. Good science!!
And we think we were born in the worst reality
i have an idea how about the slapper on the front moves up and down so not only the slap heats it but also the slight rub on each slap idk physics but i know rubbing two sticks toggeter heats them up XD
So ham next?
That's about white. No seasonings either
Disclaimer : No chicken were harmed  in the making of this video !
Dont worry guys its hammer time
Best ad ever
davie504 would be proud
I just saw the tumbnail and clicked without thinking
Sounds like rob and is the new rob but I still like rob
It feels like you’re just copying Mark Rober...
"How to cook a chicken"  Google: Use an oven  Bing:
wow, I've just spent 13 minutes watching a dude beat his meat...         ...this video was way better though.

Knock off Mark Rober

I need this device for my hoes
Such strange way to cook the chicken. Does it still taste like the oven cooked chicken? I love the creativity
Finally, curiosity cooked the chicken. That is one step for Louis Weisz, a giant leap for mankind.
Parents: The internet is a dangerous place  The internet:
Amazing!
The Chicken: SLAP: *eternal suffering*
The original meat beater 😂😂😂
Humanity went from beating our chicken to death, to beating our salmonella to death. This is a milestone, people.
It's how I learned more science from a video about slapping a chicken than I do science class.
Wife - What ya looking at hon?   Me - Meat slapping machine. Wife - :/
Humanity just keeps reaching new heights, huh. Great job man!

“The Original Meat Beater”  This video is going to be a roller coaster...
Mark Robber?
Probably works better with a live chicken
Now you guys know why your hands get hit after watching porn sites. You have been cooking your wieners the whole time.
LMAO moment...
How bout next you try to cook a chicken by slapping it at the speed of a few hundred thousand km/h?
Unnus annus did it first
“The meat beater”
Ya Mama’s Butt Woopin 3000
This is dumb.
This guy heard the saying don't reinvent the wheel and said £#<% that. I'm sticking to the oven if it ain't broke don't fix it.
I just watched I guy slap meat till it was cooked🤦‍♂️
Ala, copiando o balian
POV: me at 3AM

I like my chicken cooked by 142373 slaps. If you do 142374 don't even talk to me

If only humans discovered how to do this sooner, so many human lives would have been spared from starvation
Cap
wierd title but ok
this is chicken cpr
Hey Gordon were you at
Person: what do you have?  Waiter:  Raw chicken Toasted chicken Roasted chicken Soaked chicken Grilled chi-  Person: I’ll have slapped chicken, please.
Cook a steak next
Now I know someone somewhere has actually cooked his meat by beating it... Remember this can happen when you're beating your meat boys...
Can that machine come with a hand attachment?...
lol areogel? That's overkill.
Davie504 should do it the same way
6:39 When you’re family leaves you alone
Imagine being that chicken who died to get slapped 135k times by a dude who cooks in workshop.
Why do you have pewdiepie spray painted on a piece of plastic on the wall?
.
B-tec mark rober
Makes intricate machine, cant use cutlery.
dollar store mark rober
the new mark rober?
Why did i just watch 13 minutes of an engineer on YouTube beating his meat?
Give this to Gordon I wanna see his reaction
6:11 every car project ever
The meat beater 9001
Engineers in 1957: I bet we can put a rocket into space! Engineers in 2021: I bet I cook a chicken by slaping it!
"Yeah, you need a new one of those." 😅
LMAO, HPC got called out for their vacuum chamber idea. I would watch that video, but only because it sounds hilarious "slapping a chicken under a vacuum till cooked"
This dude has Mars yard 2.0’s on, we just gonna skip right past that
Your kidding....
Dumbest thing I have seen built but I didn't turn away the video. I watched it.... Throughout.....what has my life become
Naw that wasn't cooked
Interviewer: "Why should we hire you?" Louis: "Wellll..."
I don't care how many views this has or will have, it deserves more!
cooked chicken is 74c my guy...
This is how you get COVID 20
This whole video was a Great Value version of Mark Rober content lol
Who needs sous vide when you got slap vide?
All this over a Russian Badger joke!?!
brings a new meaning to beating meat
Russian badger will be pleased
He copied the mark rober music
Ladies and gentlemen, we did it
Unus and Annus would be proud!!
Homie using the same music as mark rober
MEAT BEATER 9001
Bro you could of saved a lot of time by working with a machinist and made it all out of steel from the get-go.
I've never seen such a thick stake.
Just buy a oven and cook the damn thing man lmao
This man gives me Mark Rober vibes
7:44 PewDiePie ... Let's go(bro army)
I guess that's the literal meaning of "beat the meat"
*Celsius* : 0 for water freezing temp, 100 for water boiling temp at 1atm. *Kelvin* : same scale as Celsius, but 0 at absolute zero. *Fahrenheit* : 0 for the lowest temperature of Fahrenheit's hometown, and 96 degrees at "approximately human temperature". Some people: Sure, let's keep using Fahrenheit.
I really don't want to say it. But you could make a lot of money in a....uh..."different" certain industry.... the one involving synthetic rubber....
The Meat beater lmaooo
''Celsius is used for real science...'' Kelvin: *Spit Takes*
Louis: I cooked a chicken with the power of slap.  -Davey504 has entered the chat-
ok now try "how many dick slaps does it take to cook a chicken"
You couldve just gotten Davie504 to do the slapping
Why this guy sound like mat pat lmfao
Should have waited till 69 ngl
Why does every engineering video on YouTube use this music
Copiou o Balian
Damn u should really use that whöler kurve
Commenting to be part of history
you don't use celsius in real science. You use Kelvin.
Is nobody going to acknowledge how he referred to it as “the meat beater?”
Slap like now
1:05 me at 3AM
Mark Rover’s disciple
He took it out of frame and brought back a new steak
Actually real science uses kelvin lmao
WTF did I just watch
Yum, the perfect medium rare chicken.
I saw this in my recommended feed and immediately thought of Spaghet
a very intresting name meat beater 9001
Literally masak ayam penyet
Vegans be like:😡😠🖕😡😠😡
I am glad that you copied someones idea:) lol
mark rober wya
[DELETED CHANNEL] would be proud.
After the previous failure this is very satisfying to see. I really believed it should be possible to figure it out
Why there are no Davie504 jokes in the comments?
You're late I've done this before in minecraft with a sword.
Could you season a steak and then eat it after slapping it?.
Introduce this kid to a Microwave...
russian badger's questions about converting physical energy to thermal energy to cook a chicken are ANSWERED
@davie504
Am I the only one that noticed that he uses the same music as mark rober 😂
So basically you slapped the bacteria in the meat to death
I respect you took 2 months to make a chicken slapper
So..... when can i install one?
Russian badgers we did it
Unus annus would be proud
Meat Beater...we need to get this technology to Adam and Eve...
How tf did i get here
Finally after so long
you could've just pan fried it.
Finally u did itt!! Congrats on your well deserved success!!!💯💯❤
Can’t wait to see this on the next season of MasterChef...
@davie504 - EPICO
This guy is literally living in 2069 when there will be no gas
Damn nice to know my ass has been cooked by my Mom
How davie504 cooks his food:
imagine someone walking in and seeing him making a big slapper
Couldn’t you just make multiple slappers? And after one breaks go on to the next one😂
Davie504 would be proud
If it took 2 months of work How many chickens did it take?
Did you stuff the chicken? Might help retain structural chicken integrity as well as help with the flavour.
2:16 You spelled Kelvin wrong.
This takes **Beat my meat** to another level
Mark and Ethan: WRITE THAT DOWN, WRITE THAT DOWN!!!!!!
Me on the hub
Mom can I go use the neighbour's oven. Mom: you can use the oven at home The oven at home:
Now replace the Dorito on a Rotary engine with a god forsaken chicken lmao.
ok BUT THE MARS YARDS THO
Try spam
mark rober 2.0
After the video ended I got a Gordon Ramsay add...
Imagine slapping your girl to the point her ass is cooked
Bing: if physical energy can become thermal energy how hard would i have to punch it to cook it? People watching the video: yes
Someone never heard of an oven
The hammer spam 5000
This must be why pp so warm
Hey dude do you use that machine to slap your Chick's ass too??
Hell yeah.
I can't believe he did it
Congrats i guess
*some years later in school* Ok students, open history book on page 146... Jimmy can u read the page? Jimmy: in 2021 a guy cooked a raw chicken by building a machine with strong motor slaping a raw chicken until it got cooked. He also cocked a steak and ate it after the success of cooking the chicken!.
congrats!
I like the Mark Rober music
Imagine: the year is 2036, and you bust out your meat slapper to cook a perfect steak
9:51 bruh season it
Imagine dying and seeing your body done like this
YAYAAYAYAYAYAYAYAAYAYAYAYAYAAYAYYAYAAYYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAAYA FINALLY I CAN STUDY PEACEFULLY!
You sound like ar12 nick
Me on december 1st: *amateurs*
Not sure why this is on my recommendations but I’m glad it was lol
Haha he said meat beater
Now how much force to cook a chicken in one slap
W H A T
1:05 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
4.1mil views in three days. You know this is some real thing
This is history
Ouch
HE SOUNDS LIKE CHARLIEEE SLIMECICLE
The mad lad actually did it!!
Give me that machine
What came first: The chicken or the slap? 😂
6:45
sorry to tell you but the pron sites are way ahead of you on this
Sorry to be childish but it’s called a meat beater
Heavenly would be so proud.
I feel like Grouse started this.
Well I guess you deserve a nobel prize, then.
PETER SCHRIPOL!!
Why did I watch this?
So it beats your meat?...
WHERE THE FUCK IS MATPAT WITH FOOD THEORY?! GET ME PICTURES OF SPIDER-MAN! What? No, wait... Sorry...  GET ME MATPAT HERE, NOW!
6:09 is that PeterSripol ???
This is the peak of human innovation
Boy am I glad to be alive to witness such an important historical event
I guess I have to slap like now.
beat meat.
9:21 Polish moment in chat
What the..... Umm, Mark Rober theme music
Super cool project, the typical Mark Rober music really caught me :D Felt just like it was one of his videos. Nice work!!!
Mark Rober music😂
B-but why?!
Ever try choking one?

Why do I laugh whenever he says meat beater....
I have seen that theory for many years but I have never seen it done in practical. Thank you for doing this!
Cavemen before discovering fire:     Hold on guys let’s all slap the corpse of the deer to cook it.
why u have to use the same background music as Mark Rober...
...what the $&!@ am I watching?

2021 Rewind
You beat that meat till it cooked ⊙﹏⊙
Imagine the vegan teacher watches this LOL
As they say, beat that meat
I guess you could say they were beating their meat 0_0
This is not funny. Have some respect for  animals. Don't create a mockery of their dead bodies .
Remember kids, the harder you beat your meat, the higher likelihood it gets cooked
My scientific curiosity compels me to ask if there is anywhere online where I could perhaps view the blueprints for this mythical invention?
74°C eh? My pc can turn into an oven then.
Davie504- what's up slapper!!!
Yo that royalty free trumpet beat is pretty damn jazzy
You did it! What a madlad
I barely can cook with a microwave.....!
Lies i slapped a chicken myself and it instantly cooked
1:05 "The original meat beater...."  Curse my mind 💀
Peak of Engineering and Craftsmanship ✨
I don't care if it's fake, I love this video
So is the mark rober music basically the default inventor/engineer background music
We now have an answer to the age-old question: "If kinetic energy can be converted to thermal energy, how hard would you have to punch a chicken to cook it?"
Elon musk needs to give this man a job
f for the pivot
unus annus did it first you turd
Answering the existential question. How many slaps do you need to cook meat?
Not whipped cream, but whipped chicken.
Spice your chicken!
But yo that’s amazing. You have the ultimate thing to tell your grandchildren
It's freaking 2 a.m and I'm about to put off my phone but youtube just HAD to show me this video (I've watched the previous one). And here I am. I'm very glad you finally got to eat ur chicken, congratulations 🎉😂
Now this is a change that I can get behind
Pov: mark robers brother?!!?
When you need to cook dinner but all you have is stuff to slap it with
Davie504 should do a chicken slap battle. I bet he has done this before.
This guy found the Mark Rober song
Mark rober vibes
what is the name of the song at about 5:00-6:00?
This guy is Mark Rober from dollar general. I love Dollar General.
Imagine what u can do if you took your science and applied it to something good, rather than using it to beat your meat.
I'm not sure i'm still into slapping now
Mongols use to put a piece of meat under there saddles and ride on it for hours to cook there meat in same way
Nobody cares how ya buildt it just show us the fucking cooked chicken
pre-drilled square tubing would've made this project a lot easier.
Sounds like a Quirk from my hero
SCIENCE!
I can't believe they based the robot off of me at 3 am.
THIS. IS. SIENCE!
the chicken gave its life for this noble cause 😂
I think the original idea was how fast would you have to slap it once to cook it.
YOU FINALLY DID IT MAH BOI #HYPE
Call me if you get salmonellas
Mark Rober's missing brother from the past.
why dont use bike?
This dude just posted a video of himself beating his meat, that’s crazy
2:35...Fitness tracker (at 2am): "Why are you running ?"
Eyyyyyy we got the Mark Rober music!
December 1st be like
Hello Fresh. Is absolute trash. DO NOT ORDER HELLO FRESH. I got sick kff both of my boxes, twice. So much wasted packaging. They forced a bix onto me when i was out of town before covid, for three weeks. They wouldnt let me change the week or cancel it. So someone got some nice meals off my porch.
A wild peter has appeared
And they said the sequels are a fail
Unless that meat is beat until it hits 165F, it's a failure
Change the title to "beat the meat"
the music is so fucking loud this vid just feels like one giant ad, shitty editing
This is the most significant scientific breakthrough in decades.  I'm proud to be alive during this feat.
This guy took beating his meat to an extreme level.... I'm not sorry
Meat beater 9000, need to borrow this for a self study science experiment
I cook my chick the same way by slapping it very hard for hours but after slapping she's the one who eats
Good to see that the legacy of [REDACTED] continues
Are you scuffed mark rober
Pchooly can cook a chicken that way np
You know you could have made this easier. You don't have to hit the chicken, the chicken can hit something else. Put the chicken and a rotary arm that slaps into a reinforced slapper or multiple slappers and try and get the kinetic energy from basically a cooking Dynamo.
Mark rober who?
feeling happy with davie504 and 69 others.
He should submit this video to Guinness world record.
This is some Ig Nobel Prize material.
Finally I’ve been waiting for this video. Congratulations on your accomplishment.
Talk about beaten his meat
“meat beater 9001” -Louis Weisz 2021
Would work real well with scrambled egg or mash potatoes though
okay but I've always asked my dad if this was possible since I was like 6. MY DREAMS HAVE COME TRU
finally... was hella long trip guys
"Fire was discovered 1 million years ago" People 1.000.001 years ago:
Your neighbors have *got* to hate you so very much.
Cook spaghetti by slapping it
Go beyond super saien 😂🤣
wtf am I watching at 3 am lmao
That instant regret on the eyes when he felt the texture
this is good and worth watching, but also a complete waste of time.
wouldnt it have been easier if your machine was constructed vertical like a forging hammer??
Finally we did lads
How to cook chicken: bing edition
he sounds like MatPat
9:20 jebać Disa co za geniusz Kisses and hugs from Poland 🇵🇱
now do it with meat
So this dude has spent 2 months just beating his meat, that's the best job ever
But does it feel good that since you invented the chicken slapper, you get to decide what the "technical term" is? Slap depth. Neat science word, huh? Coined it myself 💪😎, no big deal.
If you want to cook a chicken by slapping it, just call Davie504.
>Yoooo 60 degrees!! >Jebać Disa Jebać Disa Jebać Disa. God damn why is my country so fucked up?
அடி குடுக்குற மாதிரி சிக்கன் குக்காக மாட்டான் 😜
Supreme spitfire
I like that he is using Mark Rober editing and his same song
We wanted flying cars in 2021 but we got something better
As a great man once said "I love YouTube 🤣"  This from the old vid if u know u know
*BOLD*
Alternate title: Man cooks dinner by beating his meat
As a vegetarian, I must confess, this way of heating meat is oddly alluring.
How do you want your steak? Medium? Medium rare?        Slapped
jebac disa
Jesus what a time to be alive
Laughed really hard at the title, then it got serious when I saw the cooked steak.
Finally! Glad to have watched this 😂
Waiter:How u want your steak? Me:Slapped....waiter:ok you can watch it u till its finish cooked. Me:nice i get to watch this how awesome. Waiter: its finish here it is in the bag but wait let me carry it in the back and empty the juice. Me : thats not my steak bro!
Why would you use plastic cutlery
How is this trending
lmao the "Meat Beater 9000"
ah yes YouTube recommended me an absurd version of mark rober
I love this "jebać disa" on chat
Get a different job
He just took a scientific theory and proved it true. Now prove that I can fly with oil in the rain.
The reason the steaks texture was bead because your not supposed to cook steak for a long time you should cook it for a short time on high heat
9:20 JD
Bartender: Shaken or stirred? Bond: Slapped.
nice
Remember when he tried to sharpen tin foil 💀 i hate this kid all his videos are so dumb
idk if chicken is the meat to "technically cook" lol not taking my chances
I can safely say I’m watching someone beat their meat
They called him a mad man
This is sick lol
Why do you not season the meat?
Mysterious things in this world: 1) Ghosts  2) Witches 3)YouTube Algorithm  ( This comment is not mine.This has been Stolen.)
PLOT TWIAT: He secretely added a heating element on the slapper so it heats the chicken that way
Mark Rober 2.0 Even the music
"The original meat beater"
Considering tenderizing is a big piece of a good steak, you need to get yourself a slab of prime beef ribeye or strip since that cook temp/color  looked amazing.
Feel like every engineer uses this music....
Mark Rober been real quiet ever since this was uploaded
"This is the meat beater 9001" lmaaaoooo
11:55 look at the chat polish viewers will know what that mean
Teenage Boy: Has free-time  Also Teenage Boy: 6:40
*I need one of this , so I'll know how much slap it takes to make a child stop whining*
Imagine throwing a raw chicken off the roof to cook it..   UA
He cook our meat because it is tastier and it is also easier to eat, right?
You should have just choked it, I mean, whenever I choke my chicken I produce a lot of heat... a lot.
slapping meat isn’t a bad way too cook food, i’ll try this next time Aasim gets another rabbit to cook
឵឵ ឵឵
Next video: Chicken cooked by slapping with electric cooker element.
Slap it from the inside of the chicken, this would prevent heat losses
You aint season the chicken?
Davie504 would love this
I don't know how I got here, but HELL YES YOU FUCKING DID IT YOU ABSOLUTE MADLAD
this deserves more views
What if you pound it with a hammer instead?
Finally, YouTube is recommending proper videos
My cousin thinks this is fake
i see you mark rober 🥴👀
Engineers in 2021
We did it gamers we cooked a steak with slaps
...the fact that the previous was on my mind just this morning in the shower. I am so excited to watch this video, this is the definition of ground breaking engineering
I KNEW that was Peter’s workshop!
Why do i like seeing hello fresh ad from this guy its weird as hell
7:24 <-- When you accidentally shift to first gear instead of third
Poor chicken ughh
Best title ever 👌
Meat beater. 😂
Real science uses K (Kelvin)
ovens: **EXIST** this dude: "WAcK"
Admit it, you didn't searched for this, *it searched for you*
this has to go on the show of you have been warned.!!!!!!!
Bro... so did this start as a joke made in a russian badger video?
When the music starts at 0:57 i realise:  WAIT is this the new mark rober??
YO BRO CHILL stop beating your damn meat
i usually eat my chicken raw with hand sanitizer so the bacteria gets killed
What
science is amazing
Am i the only one finding this really disturbing like imagine your dead body getting slapped 1939299392 times ☠️☠️☠️
This is one of the world's greatest questions. Thank you.
B
The time has come, its happening
How do you like your meat cooked?  Me: Its complicated
This brings a whole new meaning to "beating your meat"
Went from lead singing for Tears for Fears to slapping meats....  "Everybody wants to slap some meats"
Why not a magnetic solenoid beater whe  u can adjust the timing Hz while being able to not slap so hard ur kill the rig and chicken
Btec mark rober. Got the music and everything
And here was me thinking that Jay Pritchett was gullible when Gloria made him slap that chicken whilst yelling. It all makes sense now. Also, how long would you need to swim in the local pool to make the water boil?
0:57 These Mark Rober vibes hut different.
I was following untill the bags of snow, where would I even find that part. Lol.  Great job man.
Ha russian badger
1:01 you know it is engineering time with that music  ie. Mark rober
Moral of the story dont half ass it just go all out the first time
Amazing 🔥 🔥 🔥
“Meat beater 9001”
1:04 " original meat beater"
Bro y don't u just make 2-3 meatbeaters and instantly switch to another one when first one breaks down
*Gordon Ramsay has left the chat*
He needs to then pan fry that steak in garlic and butter. Get a good sear on it. I bet it would be amazing like that.
The Mark Rober of "cooking chicken with slap"
Meat beater 9001. that is false advertising XD
The fact that the sponsor is hello fresh is so funny to me
Knock off Mark rober
What...
he died of salmonella.
finally
So i guess you could say youre a professional meat beater
He called Celsius as C.
1:04 "The original meat beater" Me: Ah yess the meat beater ( ╹▽╹ )
9:21 look at the chat, only polish people will understand
my mom slapped me to 50celsium
Well this took beating your meat to a new level
this is pog
EXTREMELY impressive, however... 1: You started the chicken off at 40 C, greatly reducing the amount of time the slapper had to run for. 2: You didn’t eat the chicken. You showed that it’s possible. Perhaps a part 3 is in order...
Unus and Annus would be proud ✌🏻😔 🖤⏳🤍
Why though?!
When I have kids, I'll tell them this is how we used to cook chicken back in the days
You could have used pneumatics
Other people: but why cant you just cook it in an oven Us: because SIENCE
CBT machine
scuffed mark rober
*sniffle* the memories of the channel It’s been completed, it can be done...
That chicken at the end was still pretty raw lol, least you cooked a steak, that was cool
I'm just glad to be a part of something that really matters
Damn... He really beat his meat.
I bet Davie504 can do it faster
No you didnt
I just love it when memes become science
Nice to see it working after the first failure. You didn't give up! Very cool
No chickens were harmed in the making of this video
Woah that would cook your butt if you get slapped multiple times by that thing
Yo this budget mark rober?
If only Mark and Ethan managed to make this before they died lmao
thanks imma go to sleep now
boys when they hit puberty:
i want you to marry my daughter, and I don't even have a daughter. this guy defied the laws of god
There are two kinds of countries on Earth: Those that have walked on the moon & those that use the metric system
bro it still a failure you didn’t eat the Chicken
you should have used floppy hammer you noob.
Beat your meat before eating
I can’t be the only one who thinks he sounds like Ethen Nester??
He slaps chicken, davie slaps b a s s
Freaky Factory: - “Sir, sir !!!” - “Hmmmmmm .....?” - “Grab me that meat beater 9000!” - “But sir it’s a prototype!” - “Grab me that meat beater 9000!!!”
Me : Beat the meat  Him : And I took that personally
Copied background from ctop and mark rober but video is good
The heat of the friction goes down to it’s hammer to cook it
"Beat me harder"    -The Chicken
Damn how naughty was this Chicken😩😩
Meat beater bruh
I love how he used the same music as Mark Rober
Why arent you making sex toys? Instant profit!
Plot twist you made the machine right the first time but you wanted more views so you made fake machines
When you dont have a tenderizer
F > C. Keep the commie numbers out
This is very important
Next how many slaps to kill a live  chicken
This chicken really donated his body to science.
My brother sent me this
Science wins again
I can’t believe how heavily invested I’ve been in this journey
Man I need me a *meat beater*
9:21 XDDD JD on the chat
Me after 90sec: WHY AM I WATCHING THIS  Also me, after 3:27(3:33 for a perfect shot): ah, I see
Wat?
I'm hungry
O:
i need that meat beater pls
Ahhh yes chicken
Vince: Slap chop Louis: Slap cooker
BALIAN did it FIRST!!  Hue²Br²
Steak's been Tenderized too much so it's texture is bad
i like the kicks
The Russianbagers question has finally been answered
Gordon Ramsay should react to that
You should collab with electroboom
Dislike, sorry but you didnt make it. you failed. what a dissapointing video....
I'm so glad this was recommended to me.
Why does watching this feel like watching mark rober
What a video 😂😂😂😂😂
I fast forwarded and the species changed.  P.s. was eagerly waiting for the success. The effort was inspirational.
9:21 Brawo polaczki XDDD
commenting just to boost that algo
NOW SLAP THAT SUBSCRIBE BOTTOM
Vegans Be Like: 👁👄👁
Mark rober music
I want Guga on this.
Davie504 would be proud
It tasted like it has been chewed. Nope.... I'll pass 🤣
This video is two days old and already has over 4M views.
I hate that other people use the music that mark rober uses
Am I the only one thinking he switched the steak at 9:41 ???
Meat beater 😆 ok nice name
Im vegetarian but also studying engineering so this is greaat
9:21 on chat xD only for polish ppl to understand the beauty of this 😂😂
Now this is how school should teach
This video made my day!!!
You know he isn't going to use the machine just for steak!
*_(Insert joke about beating your meat here)_*
Use LPG Gas Stove ⛽
Fake mark Rober but in a good way
When you beat your meat so hard it's not raw, it's cooked.
Never mind
This guy is like Mark Rober and I did a Thing combined
U forgot to put seasoning
Will you do beef pls pls pls
Mark Rober wannabe icl
they said it couldnt be done....
We gotta send this to gordon Ramsey
Now i know that my neighbors trying to cook chicken everyday at 3 am
Alternative title: man beats meat to increase the heat
I'm surprised I didn't see @Davie504 in the comments. That machine is a real SLAPPER.
How nobody talking about yhe Mark Rober music in the background
Me watching this whole thing and then realizing it isn't a Mark Rober video :|
Can't you weld?
Why didn’t you just have Davie504 cook it for you?
You should've put some marinade in the bag with the steak lol
the experimenter is a victim of the experimental effect....focusing on optimization would have yielded more effective results ....by utilizing the heat generated by the motor he could've simply put the chicken on top of the motor and turned it on thus cooking the chicken thru induction...the weakness in his design was the cam itself where there were huge losses due to a change in kinetic energy....by insulating the chicken it was ultimately cooked thru induction not kinetic energy...by simply changing the location of the motor and arm to over the chicken would have yielded more effective results #rubegoldberg ⚙️
Holy chicken
That's a paddlin'
Unus Annus walked so this man could run
Why did he get out of the room at 9:40? Seems suspicious asf
Why.. just why would anyone do this :|
See even Santis likes the 69420 but I prefer the 6942021
I'm glad people are finally accepting degrees Celsius as the universal measurement of temperature now.  As it should be. Finally.
What a fucking idea dude 🙁
next video; *ive proven water isn’t wet*
Da fuk... subscriotion goes out to you!
I prefer choking my chicken instead, with a few slaps in between sessions
Davie would cook it in a single SLAP.
I feel stupid.
‘Do you have a nickname?’ Me: 1:06
I love the name of "The Meat Beater"
No Unus Annus references...😔
unus annus unus annus
9:21 jebac disa
Me cooking my meat at 3am...
Oh I saw this video in my recommend it and I thought it was the old video that you failed
Gordon Ramsey still going to think your doughnut
“Take a look at my newest invention; the *Mom Imitator* !!”
Technically animal cruelty?
Kelvin is actually the measurement scale real science uses, but still, C° is goat
It's raw meat.
This is the research information aliens are after.
Ohhh damn those chicken were such a waste. Food wasted
Louis Weisz, the 4th horseman of the unique interesting videos team.
Next: ‘I slapped a chicken by cooking it’
Davie504 would like to know your location
Meatbeater2001 I'll put it as my new gamertag
0:10 its not
he cooked a chicken by slapping it
I achieved this ages ago! Slapping your wife gives you cooked chicken, you only have to do it for 3 minutes too!
FERB, I KNOW WHAT WERE GONNA DO TODAY
WHEN U fake mark rober....
G A S G A S G A S
Meatbeater😆
He Did It.
Subscribed!!
I had an idea that is to slap a static metal plate and have it transfer heat to the chicken.
Meatbeater doesn’t sound right tbh😂
*Unus annus flashbacks*
Q U E
Im surprised you didnt get sick, but dude you are sick.     Pun intended
He did it. HE DID IT!!!!
Hello fresh is over priced
Escorts want to know your location
he did it. he succeeded where Unus Annus failed.
What in the white is this that meat is not done 🤣🤣🤣 white people eat bloody food all the time bro wtf is this
Davie504 woulda cooked that chicken in ONE SLAP!
my only suggestion is salt&pepper
Gordon Ramsay: hmm medium rare beef? But the texture a bit weird.. how did you cook it  Louis: it's.. complicated..
Oven: BUT WHY? !
Literally the worst energy conversion,     This guys: *FUCKING SEND IT*
well if they  found a way to use the gathling gun idea, where they rigged more mechanical arms to slap the chicken i think they would get the result with less wear and tear on their machine, and would not have to run each of the machines as fast as dey do.
Please open a restaurant where I can order this with table-side service.
Choking it gets the job done faster
Imagine he Collab with Michael(otv mad lad)
0:59 getting mark rober vibe
When that steak came out and looked pretty not bad I was extremely stoked. This is an accomplishment for science. Every day we stray further from god.
We can prolly already cook the chicken from the overheating of the machines
The machine should have screamed "HA!" higher and louder than last time, like Jay Pritchett did. The meat would have turned out perfect!
I just think those we're more like flat punches rather than slaps.
A new era has come
9:17 jebać disa is wrong
You made one great smashburger
If a burger made with this chicken it can be called "slappy joe"
Try it with other meats!
Why didn't you use a wheel that had flexible hands to "slap". Wouldn't that have been better than what's essentially a hammer.
Try a slapper wheel with some thick rubber slappers
That steak was so rare it could have still been running around the field
That’s just called “beating your meat”
*My mom can do better than that*
This is how Chris Brown cooks his food
thank you, that's why i love Internet!
all i can think about where we would be if he was working for nasa
Finally!!!!!!! The sequel has arrived.
those mars yards fire man
Bing
lol it's not even a slap anymore
Mark Roper, William Osman, Michael Reeves, with the looks of All Gas No Brakes
teenage boys who can do it with own hand: *pathetic*
*Gordon Ramsey was here*
cap?
*HowToBasic has entered the chat*
boys, if you beat the meat fast enough you may be able to cook it
I know I'm way late to the party, but did you consider a paddle wheel design for your slapper? Seems like it would be a gentler motion no matter the rpm, and you could keep the slap rate higher.
Ragusea is okay for a source but I'd choose Weissman or Alex easily
Dude season it
Ahh here we go. The ultimate meat beat simulation technology.
Damn he rocking the Mars Yards
Am I the only one who notices he has just copied MrBro video?
Fam straight ripped mark robers music. You can cook shit by slapping it but cant find your own background music. Smh
9:21 czat XDDDD
Me when my dad told me to cook the steak for the family reunion
So FUCKIN obnoxious
I was so impressed I sent this video to my physics teacher.
Ah yes, the BlowieMatron. Shout out Linus
Nobody; Youtube:  Me: So I can slap my meat and it'll cook?
I knew the background looked familiar! Nice to see you are colabing with Peter!
FINALLY I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR EVER CONGRATS BRO
Wait until gordon ramsey sees this.
I slap my chicken all the time no wonder it has a different color to it..🤔.. I've slapped it's so much it looks medium rare
God the music is so loud and annoying
9:22
How old is this dude?
To niezly Polski chat 9:20 xD
But can a chicken be cooked by chocking it?
Science is amazing.
Got stake roasted from all sides when beating on one, excellent.
I never knew there was so much science and engineering to beating the meat
The scientific progress we needed.
when you are too busy beating your meat to buy a steak knife.
Kelvin is the temperature of science Celsius is rediculous made up poop 💩
Conclusion: use a hoven
How much force would it take to cook meat in one single blow?
He was just doing what needed to be done
*Discord Engineers entered the chat*
You finally succeeded
No idea is stupid, as long as it works.
Find something better and not worst than current time
So you are saying I can cook my meat with beating too?
I remember watching some videos when the debate was still about how hard you would need to slap it and here we are having a fully cooked slapped chicken with no more living bacteria.. And on top of that he ate a slapped steak..( With a plastic knife though ..).. Man kind did a step backwards today, history was definitely made.. Have a great day and slap like
I mean just put it in the oven
The giant dashboard beverly meddle because spinach extraorally unite along a simplistic forgery. exciting exclusive, useful sleet
Just cook it in the oven
imagine trying to cook a chicken with slaps when you could just as well use the chicken as cooling for the motor. lmao. (sorry don't mean to insult you and I applaud you for proving science greatest question. :)
11:55 chat polska gurom
supposed to be 60 celsius for 30 minutes.
12:39 a rice cooker, Fuiyoooh
Me: *Gets Unus Annus Flashbacks*
Do you and Peter Sripol live in some kind of youtuber engineer hype house?
Chicken slap-ology, a real science
Is this in peter's shop?
You could also cook the chicken through friction. Should we ask him to "rub his meat" as a next project?
I've choked my chicken a great deal  but I never thought about slapping it.  Talk about beating your meat!
Wants to calculate the number of slaps required - uses a sous vide bag lmao
Unus ANNUS. Unus ANNUS
this might just be a guess. But I feel like this guy might have taken mark rober courses.
I got excited seeing the title. We're back on track
I wanna know the train of thoughts that led to "I wonder if i slap this chicken hard enough to cook it enough for it to be edible"
this is the dumbest idea
This is How legends are made
Never have i ever watched someone beat their meat for this long
Humans have peaked.
Technically, this is not the first chicken cooked by slap power. U*** A**** did it first, but as there is no proof due to the channel being deleted, I will allow you the honor of being the first.
11:42 *THE MEAT BEATER* I’m done 💀
AHAHAHHA THE MEAT BEATER
This Made my day, thank you!
A new cook method Chicken strikes back Return of the meat beater
So if the chicken was cooked, why no eat?
Unlucky chicken 🥴🥴😋😋
Who named this slap machine?
The correct temperature to use if kelvin, not Celsius.
A clear win for original content. Keep up the good work
Amazingly Entertaining !
Perhaps heating elements are just millions of tiny slappers. Just kidding. Enjoy.
everyone here knows you do not cook medium rare fucking chicken! wtf... seving temp is 75 degrees.. what an idiot
We have progressed past the need for fire. Only cooking my food by slap from now on
I am eating chicken today😂
Next do I slapped a chicken by cooking it.
Use the fan for to be cooked remove the things for wind replace it to uhhhhhh something
Lmfao this is ridiculous. I love it.
Everyone used this before ovens were made
The way this guys explains “slow cooking” is brain hemorrhaging
Animal abuse!!!1! 😤
Finally let’s goooooooooo
Disappointed
Celsius: "I am pretty much the standard way of measuring temperature, hello."  Fahrenheit: "I'm a bit different, but people still use me. Celsius is a bit cooler than me tho."  Kelvin:  👁👄👁
Meat beater 🌝
Most guys beat their meat with less enthusiasm....
The true master of beating meat.
Ramsey will eat it
i bet my asian parents can do better
"medium rare"
youtube recommendations are relly working fine these days...
Ohh baby.Time to SLAP SOME MEEETT!!!
This man has went above and beyond... amazing
B E A T
chicken is not cooked like beef -medium or rare, it should always be well done.
Now cook it in the least amount of slaps possible
Finally, I found the meme
This would be the worst torture method holy hell
Why am I proud of humanity
Send that to Guga Foods. He is always trying to find different ways to cook and tenderize poor cuts of beef and he might try it with wagyu.
That chicken...
Shout out to the person who said “i hope the chickens seasoned” in the chat XD
9:40 I think he swap it with a cooked chicken
"So what do you do for a living?" "I beat my meat on YouTube."
Can you mash potatoes with a slapped
i feel uncomfortable
Davie504 is proud of you
"The original meat beater also had fundamental problem's."  Well you've been doing it wrong.
Adjustable slap depth
Gordon would be ashamed and proud
show this to the vegan teachr
no seasoning tho?
ngl this is disgusting
Did all this science and still didn't season the chicken
Ooooh Ramsey will be so mad if he see this
The ultimate meat beater
Cooking by beating the meat
How can be rare cooked inside and well cooked on the surface after all this time of cooking? It's fake
9:21  Polacy łączmy się w jebaniu disa
Why would someone ask « how many slaps does it take to cook a chicken »???? Why would someone even think slapping could cook anything?
_What is he Doing?_      *He's starting to Believe*
Dave504 approves
Wouldn't it be better to mate some sort of rotor with rubber flaps and let it spin you get faster slap rate and it doesn't stress as much
Lesson to be learned: Don't bother cooking a chicken by slapping it, cook a steak by slapping it instead.
This guy is definitely a Discount Mark Rober,          I LOVE IT U EARNED A SUB.!
Give this guy Nobel Prize..... 🏆😁🙏
You guys are stingy on Fahrenheit and celsius... they both measure heat...get over it
HE’S DONE IT, THE MAD LAD ACTUALLY DID IT
What's up SLAPPERS
I almost expected him to say "I know my steak doesn't look that good right now, but watch this"
I wonder if the name meat beater 9001 was on purpose
Someone’s gotta rebuild that rig (reinforced if possible) and make it a gimmick for opening a restaurant called 'beat my meat', who’s with me?
When you close your eyes it almost feels like a Mark Rober video.
Wow, according to my girlfriend, my cheeks must be like a medium rare steak by now.
That vegan teacher is shaking
That definition of 'cooking' (keeping it hot till all bacteria die) is not something i can agree with
You madlad.... you finally did it!
@davie504 *slapping intensifies*
This is the power of memes and it's as funny as terrifying.
He did what Unus Annus couldn't.
Me: (walks into a restaurant and asks for chicken) Waiter: How would you like your bird cooked? Me: (grins)
2:20 isn't the scale used for real science Kelvin?
People before invention of the ofen: Yea just 134.999 slaps left, lets go
Haha! How does it feel like to have your ass whooped!
So, is there any chance of replacing the slapper with a fist that has a hole?
All of the chicken who got slaughtered by this experiment your a hero
Cooking using the power of slapp... Davie504 approves.
Reason we cook our food is bioavailability of nutrients. Not pasteurization.
The channel that was removed from this world would be proud. Memento Mori
Maybe this would work  Lets say you heated a metal sheet with slaps than cooked a egg on it
You know, theoreticaly the electricity is powered by smoke, if the smoke comes out, the electricity stops working...
HE FINIALLY DID IT
New island survival tips
It looks like you went to the other room and switched bags lol
Can’t wait for Gordon Ramsey to react to this on his tiktok.
OR JUST COOK IT!
He really beat his meat
Aliens: wot r homans doin? Humans: cooking meat with slapper* Aliens: let's give them another 2000 years...
Maybe im a chicken
Can't wait for people in 20 years seeing this video and realizing how far we've come
I'm getting Mark Rober vibes

We cook food to kill bacteria Me: we cook it to get a better taste
Next time do it on a live chicken
Stupid man trying to kill Bacteria with Heat when the poor bacteria and its future 9 generations died from 69,420 fast hard consecutive slaps.
My man did it, he finally did it
why do all channels that make things use that background music lol
Omg guys! Someone need to let this guy knows about the existence of pans and stoves
real science experiment uses kelvin

man, you had to make them advertisment, no one wants right opposite of meat beater 9001
his slapper cooks better than me lol
so now there needs to be a video of a chicken that you cook  by slapping and eat it!
At last you made it🔥 Time for WINNER WINNER CHICKEN DINNER!
There's no such thing as "rare chicken"....
Imagine being a chicken and dying for this lmao

slapp battle with davie504
I remember when someone said "how hard do you have to slap a chicken to cook it?"
WAIT HE WHAT HUH ????
I wish top gear did this with a 6 litre V8
you should call it "The Meat Beater 2000" or "The C0ck Slapper 2000"
11:55 jebać disa
Lmao love how hydraulic press channel came in clutch with a bad idea
true definition of beating your meat
Kelvin is the scale for real science.  Celsius is just its inbred cousin, no better than Fahrenheit.
Half of the likes are for his conversion to Celsius
Barney Stinson just shat his pants
This lends credence to the idea that Mongol/Tartar armies put meat under their saddles and the ride would soften and slightly cook the meat.
That electric bill gon com like a slap
Interesting video, but the music is not really needed. Could be silenter at least.
Contraindications on completing your chicken slapping mission!   I wonder if you can transfer some of the heat of the motors to the "chicken oven, cooking surface, etc?"  Perhaps the next the design could use a vibrating sheet of metal to cook of some size, 2ft x 2 ft square...?   working much like a sander  or up and downj?  Getting rid of the slapping arm might also remove a lot of issues.... granted with a vibrating sheet of metal sideways or up and down will create different ones.
Next video: making campfire with ice
1:04 eheh. meat beater.
Blowimatron and meatbeater Hmmmmm interesting
Stupid video -.- 🤢🤮
XDDDD 9:29 i jebanie disa na czacie XDDD
Holy shit! You did it dude! Congratulations
Lo logró, el maldito lo logro.
didn’t mr beasts brother make the same video?
To the people who disliked, the video wasn’t to eat a chicken that has been beat , it was to cook a chicken that has been beat . Well done bro I enjoyed it was definitely worth a like !
I knew the meat beater 3000 would come in clutch💀
“The original meat beater” Did you ever re-think that sentence lol
Dude in vid: this is the first chicken ever to be cooked by slaps.   Cavemen before fire was invented:
Me: Oh no My oven's broke how am I gonna cook my chicken now?  Louis: Watch This *Enters Intense Slapping Mode*
now thats what i call beating meat
Looks nice, next you can put chicken in a tube and rotate it till it will be cooked. Chicken will get warmer after impact with the bottom of the tube
*n o i c e*
You needed some sort of shock absorber. You lost a lot of kinetic energy.
You should have called vasily komotskiy
Is this what the expression beat the meat was all about ?
Damn, chat at 9:21 was really profound.
"The slapper" : It can slap you It can slap everyone But importantly it can slap your chicken until it cook
Unus annus would be proud.
Goku would be proud
LoL next video cooking meat on rectifier 😂😂
Neat
This guy seriously needs a job. Good skills.
Pretty sure that is Mark Rober's background tune lol
Kid i dont have much time but this man is a........

What the hecc
Hello Fresh - The "sustainable" way to get all your food delivered in plastic wrap   pffft, buy a book people
The lengths this guy went to to not have to use an oven ...
Omg i paused for a second around 6.58 and saw a censor on the word "Ni**a", like WTF YOU EDITOR REALLY READED ALL THE LIVE CHAT?!
I'm impressed that it only takes 2 to 3 times more energy than cooking in an oven. It's impractically complex, but this is proof that it is a viable experiment.
Mark Rober lite
"I will cook it no matter the cost" uses plastic utensils to cut the meat
4:49 Source: Adam Ragusea 🙃
8:17 = my right arm
When you took the joke too seriously
he should open restraunt where every food is made by slapper
SLAP LIKE .... I mean to say THE CHICKEN NOW!
This is the spirit of mythbusters without the restrictions of television.
This takes Beating meat to another level
Mark Rober but not Mark Rober
Beat the meat let's gooooo
bravo i would of never thought of this.  maybe a a big spring for the arm
Me when I’m home alone:
This guy took "beating my meat" to another level.
Marvellous! This discovery is ground breaking for human race.
MEAT BEATER 9001?!?!!?
WE DID IT BOYS 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏 🍾🥂🎉🍾🥂🎉🍾🥂🎉
So basically my parents are trying to cook me
Is "Slapping-the-Chicken" conceptually-similar to "Slamming-the-Ham?"
I was going to ask you to make a video om how much energy you used vs. How much is typically used but you got that covered already!
Ok lets just hope he doesn't he married
Lame brains: another dumb post  Big brains: lol you used the waste heat energy that was produced every time the thing striked it to cook it! Thats so funny!  Me: interesting. .
At the restaurant: "yea, I'll have my chicken slapped. Thank you."
Davie504 will approve it
I came for the Mark Rober music, thank you
Actually, Kelvin is the real temp
9:20 "Jebać disa" na czacie xd
Imagine a chicken gets born, fed and killed just to get slapped like r e a l l y fast
Aprrently that is how to modern people beat their meat
If you must use "real science" measurements for temp you should have used kelvin
They said it could not be done.
you literally told it "I like ya cut g"
Remember to put this on your resume!
@davie504 hahaha
walmart Mark Rober
This is how people heated up their food before discovering fire...
Parents "our son is a genius, OK son what profession do you want to focus on?" Son "I want to slap a chicken till its cooked" Parents "This is where we need to talk about your real parents"
Interesting video but can't stand the amount of "YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO" "LETS GOOOOOO" BS.
I dont understand how i go from watching a tarkov video to a guy slapping a chicken to its cooked temp... the internet blows my mind.
9:24 jebać disa
What a Time to be alive!

13 minutes of a man beating his meat 4 millions people : *interesting*
So that’s why girls tell me I taste like chicken...just beat my meat too much.
You should have had HowToBasic in there. He slaps everything.
I guess you can say this guy really beats his meat.....
Beat your meat on a whole new level
Just get those shaolin guys to slap your chicken, they slap water, sand, a pillow filled with sand, some rocks. Why not some poultry? They trained, and they got food.
This will definitely become a new alternative medical procedure.
But...... WHY?
100% trying to steal @Mark Rober vibes here. Has the sound track and general intro 🤔
My mom just hit my back so hard and I feel so warm there. Am I being cooked
A whole new meaning to beating meat
Who knew that beating your meat, can cook it 😂🤣🤪
He beat his chicken a bit too much...
That's some chicken
“The oven was invented in 1490” People before 1490:
NSFW: 12:20
imagine cooking in far future  someone: *puts a chicken into a oven* oven: would you like to cook it by slapping it or by normal means? someone: ...both... INSTANT COOKED CHICKEN
"Want me to whip you some meal?"
How many chickens has this guy gone through
Day 747 in lockdown:
We also cook our meat because it uses less energy to digest cooked meat, leaving more for us to use on fun stuff... like building chicken slapping machines 🤣

Davie504: Checkmate, ovens!
Whole new meaning to beating your meat
This makes me think of Spencer from icarly’s inventions😂😂
He just needed to slap the chicken himself, thats how David504 would do it
Why didnt he just enchant the hammer with fire aspect 2?
Bro that rice is soggy
NICE
Davie504 after seeing this video: I APPROVE!!!! 👍
12:05   YT community "pshhh its only 2am?"
...so Star Platinum is actually a chef.
Wonder how Gordon Ramsey gonna react ?
He has beaten his meat on another level .
Fun Fact. 1.5 year screaming on a Coffe will bring it also on like 50 degrees :)
He really took the: *Beating my meat* For a whole new level
IT'S OVER 9000!
I’m also somewhat of a Meat Beater 9001 myself
I don't know why people dislike this video... It's very amazing dude
Yea i still wouldn't eat that... no offence

Unus Annus fans be screaming
Davie504's favorite dish. Chicken a là slap
Slap that chickens back. Goldfish!
Imagine first human invented how to cook their meat by slapping it
The fact that you did chicken, one of the longer to cook meats, you could easily do steak and other meats now
LTT fans bloweymatron

Funny tittle
beat the meat and eat the meat
How you managed to eat a steak with plastic cutlery amazes me!
Who else thought this was click bait?

This guy looks so high. I mean I am too but he looks high too.
Ya'll got to start a home slapped chicken restaurant
Ok, now do this with my ass 😳

Just noticed he uses the same background music as Mark Rober
9:22 only polish will understand  the chat
So the rig was poorly built so if you make a better rig this challenge is no problems👍🏼
He forgot rgb... It would've been way smoother

Idk why but i wanna put my hand on the chicken
My nigga souved the meat again just like the last video 🤦🏻🤦🏻🤦🏻
10:00 ewww! Raw! :P Now, for well done?
Couldnt you have just made the circle spinning thing a smaller diameter so it wouldn't have as much energy when slapping the chicken?
This guy took beat the meat to another level
Davie504: *pitiful*
@Davie504 we have a slapper here
Imagine if this becomes a torture device where this machine slaps your tummy over and over until it heats up...
9:21 pozdrawiam wszystkich Polaków JD widzowie

When my grades are low i am hotter than the chicken believe it
We need to show Davie504 this slapper!

A brain like this and you use it to build a device that slaps a chicken to cook it.        I'd do the same 😂
Whats the name of the background song at 1:20? Please, any hero?
I am here thanks to "Memetastic"
Just put it in oven, I am hungry 🙈
slapped cooked chicken asmr
Watch out KFC.
sooo now we can slap food.
My host family in Japan liked to fix up raw chicken. It freaked me out the first time. I ate it to be respectful. I never got sick lol, but I think Japan is very careful when raising chickens specifically to be eaten raw... so it's not as risky as it sounds.
Just a lad beating his meat in a workshop
Next: use a base to actually SLAP IT!
They said it could not be done. They were wrong -Jäger

You did not slap it. Liar clickbait.
You should upload this video to the hub
You mad lad
Some scientists: *Studies years of tech for the better future of humans, and medicine*  Also some scientsts: *Can beating our meat cook it?*
you feel like mark rober
Oh by the way hellofresh is a fucking rip off never trust a youtuber who is willing to lie for sponsor money

He took "beating your meat" to the next level
Poor chicken
Cooked by the power of 'SLAP'.  Davie504: Approved! 👍
People in past: We will have flying cars in the future. People in the future: **Slaps and cooks chicken**
Finally, the madman, he did it.
Why I season my slapper and not my meat
So what is the number after all?
I think the sponsor should have been 'Hello Food Poisoning' for this video. xD
fck stove, we have slapper
The original beat meater what???
Let Chef Ramsay eat it
This is what i call content. Love it. Kudos!
You're visitor: this chicken taste good!! What is your procedure?   Louis be like: uhh..I slapped it a lot?  You're visitor: oh..thats why my butt gets hotter
the fact you have rice cooker made my day
Davie504:pathetic...
The child in me laughs when he said the original meat beater....both my original meat beaters can scar a hot dog I can't cook chicken...love the vid bro
That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind.
Madladdddd
this is disgusting the moment he said " its been chewed like for 1 minute " i was legit disgusted. imagine eating something that has been chewed by someone for 1 minute
Ohhh .......... interesting Its really ..ummm ok.....but is the chicken tasty btw‽
Are you mark rober?
The most beautiful display of inefficiency I have ever witnessed
Now the quote "I'd slap it so hard it would cook on impact" actually makes sense.
Is that real palace?
how human cooked meat before discovering fire:
This takes meat "beating" to whole another level
By god he did it
You've completed Unus Annus's Goal of cooking chicken by slapping it. It's been said they attempted with bare hands but oh boy technology has made their goal possible, bravo Louis! (This is a joke btw please don't take this seriously)
Gordon Ramsay has left the chat
Gordon Ramsay has left the chat
i wonder if your local supermarket was getting suspicious of the amount of chicken you were buying
1969: "We overcame man's greatest engineering challenge yet, we landed on the moon" 2021: "We overcame man's second greatest engineering challenge yet, we cooked a chicken by slapping it"
Other people : really worried about covid-19 Him : *Cook a chicken with slaps*
another clickbait but who cares
OMG YOU DID IT!!!! CONGRATSSSS
Congratulations☆*:.o(≧▽≦)o.:*☆
I think you would be a great wood shop/ engineering teacher Becuase your young And energetic and I feel students would love you for those reasons. I mean personally I would Cuase young teacher who is relatable. That’s kinda amazing.
The 5k dislikes are from chefs
this guy is a legend
Remember to cook the subscribe button
Someone call Davie504. Louis didn't needed to build all these if he called him
I subbed
9:21 only Polish people will understand 🤣 (chat)
ID is unbielievebel, ei kannot bielief dis! Joe ken koek e tjikken wit hitting id wit slepping
You should invite DAVIE504 he is a professional slapper i promise😁
You should invite DAVIE504 he is a professional slapper i promise😁
You should invite DAVIE504 he is a professional slapper i promise😁
You should invite DAVIE504 he is a professional slapper i promise😁
I guess the next question would be what's the most efficient way of cooking a chicken using kinetic energy in general, as opposed to thermal?
That's what I call "Beat the Meat"!
You should invite DAVIE504 he is a professional slapper i promise😁
Imagine being the animal whose extracted meat was cooked via slapping. What an honor
Davie would be proud
I can't believe that this could be also done in 5 mins...
This video should have been called "A man beats the meat many times and then eats it"
Now how many Hitachi Magic Wands would it take to do the same thing?? 🤔🤔
ayam geprek cuk
Wait— amazing
If u don't have fire to cook, just slap it
That’s simply not right
Him:Perfect Medium Rare  Me:Whats that blood I cant eat that its raw
F
With time this could be revelutionatary Low heat cooking
100 degrees bro
Waiter: how would you like your steak?   Me: slapped.
WOW CONGRATS
so thats how my p.nis got cooked
He is just beating his meat
And now?... he has salmonela
Why couldn't you title it that you cooked a steak by slapping it? It is annoying you misnamed the video.   But my god that was funny and really impressive.
do u have Polish surname ?
Gordon Ramsay: Its RAW! GIVE IT A SLAP OR TWO
Meat beater 9001  Sounds straight out of American Pie !!
Beat that meat.
WTF did I just see? 1:55
9gag got me here.
So coco gets taken off youtube but they will allow a video dedicated to beating meat    ( also 1:55 )
i will tell my kids this is elon musk
I wanna see him eat it
Most intense video I've ever seen and I don't regret it
9:20 JD armia jest wszędzie
WHY DID YOU CALL IT THE MEAT BEATER!
You deserve a stadium full standing ovation 👏
Damn didnt knew chris from mrbeast is a genius
This is a partially done basic lab demo from college physics courses.  Also, you didn't cook it.  You provided a little extra heating after subjecting it to "sous vide" cooking.
He's beating his meat.
Well now i know how to make myself warm
this dude is an ABSOLUTE mad lad.
Classic   quote..,    5m59s  " *Roasted the Veriak* !! "
Uses 2 to 3 times more energy but it is 2 to 3 times better
Why on earth did you not make a rotary slapper?  A spring-loaded chicken holder to keep the slap pressure pretty equal and with several slapper elements, like rubber  mats, you could get to the required number of slaps much quicker without  the vibration your idea produces.
I was hoping your were gonna say “this shit SLAPS” when you ate that steak 😂
Ovens were invented on 1490 People in 1489:
"Man, I always love my meat grilled. How about you?" "I beat my meat" "What" "What"
This is just a video of someone beating their meat... well technically
You look like a young ruffalo
Slap that wrapped in a bun with a little cheese and even Gordian Ramsey would be impressed 😂😂😂   Wait wait I might just be dum but is that Peter as in Lego plane Peter ✌️😂😂😂
You are like Top gear Jeremy Clarkson. He may be doing cook it by dragging it by car, or driving over it multiple times.
Btw you cant eat chicken raw
If we do the same to an ASS will it also become hotter asking for a friend
Btw you cant est chicken raw
He used the mark rover song, so u know this is gonna be some gooood shit
Customer: What's taking my order too long? Waiter: The chef still slapping it!
I saw this in a meme chat in Discord and I couldn't expect something so scientific and so interesting!
He changed the stake when he went out of the room after telling it was cooked
Cooking a chicken in 2 slap incoming?
Can I cook my meat
Slapper go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
What's up, slappers!... oh, wrong channel
scuffed mark rober lol
That was awesome can't imagine the time and effort taken to do this after the first part.
But... Real science uses K, not °C.... D:  But to be fair, in this case doesn't really matter as you are only calculating an increment, wich would be equal in both units.
This man took the words *"Beat The MEAT"* to a whole new level.
Jebać disa
Great Job!  If this rig ever comes out again...maybe shock mount the frame so it doesn't slide on the floor.
when you learn how to cook from Physics teacher instead of chefs
" Mom I'll be out in the garage slapping my chicken"
*Gives "beating your meat" a whole new meaning.*
Yeah, waiter, I'd like a medium-rare steak slapped to perfection with the meat beater 9001 please. And a side of -lotion- butter.
I’m so fucking glad I got this in my recommendations this dude is golden
Ironic that you fried every part of the rig before cooking the chicken...
Watching your videos, seeing how über excited you get, I’ve come to realise that you are, basically, me (but with a penis & shorter hair, lol)! 😆😂🤣
Hey Louis Antihero here, loved the video :)
Lets be real he didn’t eat it because that shit wasn’t cook thoroughly
Pick a better cut for the steak next time.
Louis Weisz. --Slapping chickens since 1989

Imagine in the near future we could be getting our meat beat and sprinkled with gold flakes by celebrity chiefs for a small fortune.
Finally
You whated a what by whating what?
This is how Davie504 cooks his food
Not gonna lie He looks like mark robers twin brother
Who was here because of the youtuber neamed memetastic
Fucking fake u got another steak in the other room... There is sauce on it dude..
you have beaten the hell out of your meat
They called him a mad man
this is going to be your most viewed video, by far.
Shows to @TheRussianBadger
Anyone else think that this guy sounds like Remy from Ratatouille?
This feels so wrong on so many levels. Would report this as abuse but unsure what category (physics? animal? engineering? culinary?) this belongs to.  Would just let it pass I guess.
The original meat beater * me laughs
We have evolved.
i sense TheRussianBadger vibes here
What if a chicken doesn’t need to be put on fire to be cooked? Maybe it just needed all those germs to be slapped away
I never thought this was possible
Advice: don't jump to 9:50 thinking you'll see the cooked chicken... That was... not a good sequence of thoughts and feelings.
9:21 polska guurooom
Actually the degrees for temperature used in science I’m pretty sure is degrees Kelvin
Bro what
jebać disa xD
this is something i imagine mcu peter parker watching during breakfast or something
Adding meaning to the phrase “beating my meat”
What if after covid, u get 70.000 people gathered in a line and everyone slaps the chicken twice as hard as they can
am i watching mark rober
Wait, don't you need to get it to that temperature and then hold it there for however long? Or does the fact the meat is that hot mean it's already cooked?
Such passion just to eat undercooked chicken. Respect dude
look at this distinguished gentleman...
Mark rover copycat
We finally did it boissss! 😭😭🔥🔥
We have achieved peak civilization. Well done.
Your perseverance is unreal
Nope not even close to really cooked
so this is what happened to all the kids who grew up watching mythbusters
THANK GOD
This just reminds me of RussianBadgers Video one time when he talked about how hard you'd have to hit a chicken to cook it. Not quite there but i definitely think this is frigin awesome to answer a truely funny question. Good job by the way!

Rip off mark Rober
I mean someone needs to do it with a ground compactor
Davie504 approves this element
So you’re saying I can beat my meat medium rare and just simply serve it up to the wife 🤷🏼‍♂️
I'm getting Mark Rober vibe from this channel..
This feels like a Mark Rober video
Meat Beater 9000. He really did not let that opportunity pass and I respect him for it.
Happy to be alive for this moment
See kids, this is why you don't beat your meat to much
I'm so disappointed in myself for missing the live stream.. Not disappointed in your inevitable success in real science!
Davie504 will be PROUD
There is a legit nobel prize gor dumb science

You have an exam this week you should study...  YouTube:
I don't think there's going to be anything more important than this in the current decade.
This is a really well made video! Nice
How everyone cooks their food: *Stoves, Ovens, Microwaves* *How I imagine Davie504 cooks his food:*
The steak is just raw meat tho
I see you are beating your meat
This has been the journey I never knew I wanted.
u should try using an LS1 to power that slapper
Title: I cooked a chicken by slapping it What I saw: I cooked a steak by slapping it
I'm sorry but what in the actual clucking flock?
This guy uses fucking plastic fork and knife? Cringe
I know the steak sucked but still, missed opportunity eating that steak to say, "that shit slaps"
11:55 jd
Idk why it’s crazy to me no one considered seasonings the chicken.
FINALLY IT HAPPENED
Given the drawbacks of the power consumption of the chicken slapper, what about making an off grid version, using a water wheel and belt drive to power the slapper. Meaning you could catch, slap and eat your meat in the wild.
LMAO I SAW PORNHUB PREMIUM ON THE CHAT AND IT WASNT BLURRED its around 5:51
Hacker!!!!!
This gives a whole new meaning to “beating my meat”
Hello everyone this is your daily dose of internet...will it happen?
All he needed for the steak was A1 steak sauce
Hey you should’ve totally tried to use a goose for this experiment… Because then you could literally say that your goose is cooked. 😂
This was originally an Unus Annus idea right?
Well..if one wants their meat EXTRA tender...this'll do it lol.

Poor chicken
Taking “Beating my meat” to a whole new level.
Should have moved the pivot point on the arm, it doesnt need to move so far and would be faster, reduce the wear and  reduce the load moving a lesser distance
about time, jeez
has science gone too far?
Woah... You are great at beating the meat man!!
didn't even give Unus Annus a footnote man
DAFAQ
"you sure you want to name this machine meatbe....?" *Yes*
No 75c is cooked
This chicken had no idea its body would be donated to science
Should be in kelvin but meh
1:21 hmm i wonder wHo uSEs THiS music?
Yeah.. it's cool and all, but can you cook a human tho?
Why don't you get a sub?
All this effort a research to cook it and none fore seasoning?? Wheres the flavor, Louis????

Wait... You spent all that time cooking chicken and didn't season it first?
This is what humanity's unlimited knowledge can do.... aliens watch out.
The myth busters would like to know your location.  Fr though you should collab with Adam he has a YouTube channel!
"Celsius is the scale used for real science."  *5 thousands American hit the dislike button furiously

Pasteified chicken
Slap it until it cook
Some say this food is good.... some say it slapps
No thanks I’m sticking with the oven
I totally remember 4 years ago I was fighting about this topic with my ex boyfriend, thanks for proving my point, I was carrying this with me for a long time
So next try to gather a bunch drummers and see if they can cook the Meat with sticks and rudiments
How do you cook your steak? I slap it to perfection ..
Hmm.
9:21 jebac disa
Perform this on genius world record lol
I mean I've heard of a pressure cooker but um...
90% of the time YT algorithm sucks.... but the rest 10% are gems
So you're saying, if we keep on slapping that subscribe button, then our phones gets cooked? 😅
Survival tip, continuesly slap chicken
Genie: “ what’s your wish, you may only have 3 “ You or me: “ I want to be able to cook a chicken by punching it once “ Genie: “...        *that one is on the house* “
Where is Davie504
You are a carbon copy of another YouTuber. I won't mention ... Music also ..nuances in your voice...it's s shame because you have good content...
he  attac. he protecc. most importantly   he fried chicken by slaping
This looks like a mark rober video
“ma’am how do like your chicken?”  _”slapped”_
woah so i can cook my meat
HIS ELECTRICITY BILL OH NO-
Meat beater
Who else just likes to watch videos like this but dont understand a thing about engineering
Imagine receiving life from your your dear mother to see a beautiful world and one day they cut you and use your leftover body parts as a test experiment in which your meat gets slapped by a machine made by a random youtuber for no other reason than to get views. Life is weird.
"I Cooked a Chicken by Slapping It" *It was actually Steak, but who cares.*
Why don't you make it virtual..like a piston...that way you'll achieve higher RPM, stability, strong structure and can even slap intensity
Plus one sub for your background. ;)
If you can get past that... as he almost yacks..🤣🤣
Damn i thought he must have given up  But he didnt  I need his dedication for my studies.

Davie504 would be proud of this shown power of the slap
Your hard work motivates me 👍
this channel feels like Mr. Beast meets Mark Rober
Mark Rober music gives this a very familiar vibe.
Thanks I have a school task where I need to find someone sponsoring a thing and there is is!
Watching this regains my trust to Mother nature
why did nobody tell me that Mark Rober and Joshua Weissman had a kid? and the godfather is Adam Ragusea???? hellloooo???
I wonder how davie504 reaction on this one 🤣
rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
hello ive been following this journey hahaha and it'll be nicer if he just marinated the meat HAHAHAH
Can you present your videos in a different way? Cool vid but you sound, look, and present your videos just like every other youtuber in the engineering space, same fake excitement and jokes. I was gonna subscribe but I have many of you on my timeline. Good luck, I hope you make millions.
I recommend that you uninstall the plate at the end and install a grasping hand  *IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN*
9:21 -Poland joined kurwa XD
Start from 0, not 50 to 60

So, got a cooking add before this video...
Now, *THAT'S* how you *beat* your *meat* .
I jebać Disa wszędzie xdddddf
Get a fully cooked steak. I think that would be a better challenge and would taste better
Legit mark rober but btech
I think one of the reasons that the arm ended up breaking several times is that you weren't taking into account the natural resonance at which it bends. If the length of the arm or the speed of the motor aren't adjusted so that it perfectly counters the resonance frequency of the arm, it will bend further than the wood can withstand.
I just watched this.... I regret watching this.
2:15   Celsius is used for science.  Kelvin : - Am I a joke to you ??!
The only reason I finished this video was the phrase Meat Beater.  I'm glad I did

Hey dude do you think that I can beat my meat this fast and cook it. I could also make meatballs
"holy cow" definitely

Comments be like: BEAT THAT MEAATTT
I think you faked it why did you went off camera to throw liquid ??
It feels like watching mark robber only mark is better
I stand corrected. Forgiveness please.

This is insane yet incredibly awesome, is there anyone else that would double check this? I'm sure everything was well thought out but so far this incredibly amazing.
This man has far too much free time
Davie504 would be proud
Also doubles as being a very good tenderizer
Davie 504 would love this video!! 😂
WHAT A MAD LAD HE DID IT
"meat beater" Yea.......i went there.
replace with fleshlight 😏
13 minutes really..
this guy took beat your meat too literally
Lol that was good to watch
Ok Youtube algorithm, great job on this one
there should be a slapathon after this.
Well I know how I’ll be cooking my Thanksgiving Turkey now
I remember a wise man once said : "If kinetic energy can be turned into thermal energy, how hard would i have to punch a chicken to cook it ?"

He sounds like mr beast
This gives of large Mark Rober vibes
You just needed Davie504 to slap the chicken and it would'be been cooked.
Imagine being in history class in like 50 years from now and you have to do a research paper about the first chicken that was slapped to perfection

i think now all scince videos are required to use this background music
0:03 my brain trembles
Me just hoping they seasoned it
steak is disgusting. if you wanna eat raw meat, just why bother?
is this RussianBadger shitpost comes to life? **slaps a chicken so hard it turns into friend chicken**
If it's stupid and it works it's not stupid.
Idk, if one of your potential failure scenarios is that the chicken is turned into paste, starting at a higher temp feels like cheating.

I like the vid, but could you use diffrent music. Otherwise you just look like a wanna be mark rober/michael reeves. (Idk about your other vids tho, this is the first one ive seen)
I'm glad you made it man finally !
Can you slap protein to doness, yes. However gentle cooking is the more logical way.   So what's the slowest most gentle way to cook a protein? That's the next breakthrough invention
I'm glad you made it man finally !
That chicken slaps.
"I cooked a chicken by slappin it" I see no clickbait here 😌
"Ferb I know what we are doing today"

The feeling when you're not quite sure whether something is genius or idiotic.
Imagine if the NASA scientists who put a man on the moon saw this video, boy would they feel stupid
What a time to be alive.
I'm sorry for this but... if you beat your meat hard enough you can cook it?
The moment he said I will go and throw away the juice that the steak made.  Couldn't he just replace the steak??
Me at December 1st:
*_Faster slap rate_*
Have you ever been with a woman
Celsius for real science? Sounds like you caved to the European market. Should have gone straight to Kelvin.
Im so happy that someone actually did it
Gordon ramsey, beat hus fcking meat
That chicken died for our curious scientific sins
9° "C" weirdest thing I've heard in a while
Wish he had said "it slaps" after taking a bite.
I love everything about this video except the celsius. It means nothing to me, and I cannot relate it to my normal life because I don't use any part of the metric system in my daily life here in the USA. I literally have to google anything metric anytime I see it because I have no idea what size any of it is in relation to the Imperial system which I know and use constantly.
Literal beating the meat
@Davie504 might approve XD
YES. I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS!
No stove? Stove has no gas or energy? Texas? No problem😏.
10:46 A bad steak? More like a mi-STEAK        I'll see myself out...
This is amazing
When chicken is done ✅ Now we gotta run our cars by stroking
Salt bae does this with just a smack or two
Born too late to explore the world, too early to explore space.  *But just in time to know discover how many slaps does it take to cook a chicken, Hell yeah baby! woo!*
This is for guys who like to bbq but don’t have hands
Bro this isn’t mark rober yet sounds very similar
How people prepared food before the oven was invented
161.. actually.. but whatever. ;)
I'm not accusing you of anything but taking the bag out of the room without showing us anything before coming back with a cooked steak is a bad look
Davie504 left the chat*
So basically this man is a mixed version of mark Rober and the hacksmith
We need Gordon Ramsay to cook a five star steak in the slapper
You know he's serious when he uses Mark Robers music
salmonella: salutations
Try bread
This is just amazing! Ive been following your progress through Tik Tok and Im so happy you cooked it yes!! Also you just ate history! The first meat cooked by the power of slaps XD! Congrats! Winner winner, chicken dinner! Thank you for taking us on this journey!
Season it and try again for the steak, use honey or pineapple juice, it maintains tender
Cool.
Loterally just watched the original video a few days ago and now its on my recommended.
So now we need to see how much one hard slap can cook a chicken
You and I did a thing should do a collab
*Smh, just order a Fried Chicken from Mcdonalds*
Reminds me of that Unus Annus video
wow... congrats 😲👏🎉🎉 you did it finally!
Very impressive but the chicken was not cooked, just sterilized, still pretty cool
I love how my polish brothers spammed jebac disa in the chat xDDDD
It's successful finally
1:05 "the original meat beater" wdym by that?
So no ones gonna talk about how he called it the meat beater 9000 ?
Capitalism was a mistake.
Um...no  Cooking at a set degree that’s below the SAFELY COOKED TEMPERATURE doesn’t have positive effects, in fact it actually has NEGATIVE effects  If you try this, you’ll find yourself surprised, it’s a rare case yet it happens when people working in a kitchen assume you can cook or reheat foods to around 60 degrees Celsius and it’s safe to eat  THIS IS NOT TRUE PEOPLE, you MUST cook or reheat food to a safe 74 degrees Celsius, and HOT HOLD at 60 degrees Celsius, HOT HOLDING IS NOT THE SAME AS COOKING, HOT HOLDING KEEPS THE FOOD HOT, COOKING KILLS THE BACTERIA IN THE FUCKING FOOD  If it remains anywhere between 60 degrees and 4 degrees Celsius for too long, the bacteria in the food can form a protective outer layer known as a spore which can keep it safe from bacteria killing methods such as cooking or freezing  In other words, DO NOT TRY TO COOK SOMETHING TO 60 DEGREES AND ASSUME THAT’S ENOUGH OR TRY TO HOLD THE COOKING TEMPERATURE THERE  If you’re thinking “This guy doesn’t know what he’s talking about” then think again, I took a cooking class in my school and we worked in our school’s cafeteria, someone made this mistake and got three people sick because of it, they were also kicked out of the class and suspended  So, I will say this one more time, if you are cooking or reheating food, cook it to a safe 74 degrees Celsius and hot hold at 60 degrees Celsius  You should also not hot hold food for longer than two hours, if it’s been hot holding for more than two hours, dump it, I know it seems like a waste, but it’s better than endangering people by serving it again or eating it yourself and endangering yourself
1:56 that looks wrong-
This is the science we need
So... you could theoretically cook chicken with a vibrator.
Bruhh
He's the man!

Did the chicken consent to getting slapped raw 😳
+How do you want your steak sir -Slapped until meduim rare
Davie504 wants to know your location
Nawet tutaj jebia disa
Disliked cuz this real science shouldve kept AMERICA UNITS
Wait, am I the only one who thinks Louis Weisz is a knock-off Mark Rober?
Speaking of slapping... 🎧
i have some major redesign ideas.  so, way back when, there was a machine built to measure the number of licks it ACTUALLY took to get to the center of a tootsie roll pop. it was effectively a motor driven wheel of "tongues" (texturized sponges with a moisturizing solution sprayed once every rotation meant to mimic saliva) which would sort of "bop" a tootsie roll pop attatched to a spring and a microswitch, which would count up on a computer for each impact of the lolly on the "tongues", representing the overall number of licks necessary to reach the center.  so this inspired my idea for a sort of rotary slapper, with spring actuated "hands" (rubberized or silicon coated peices of polymer composite board like the cutting board) which can hit the chicken bag at a regular, even pace, and cook it much quicker, and making it more efficient by a factor equal to the number of hands attached. attaching this wheel of hands directly to the motor drive will reduce the number of moving parts that can fail, and reduce the needed durability for those parts.  We'll be slapping in circles baby
Can you cook a chicken by spins?
Crack team of discord engineers lol
WHERE IS DAVIE504
Atleast we all know if we do get stranded and don't know how to make a fire we can slap our food
the fact that you kept going.. damnnn bro
I am very proud of you

I love the Mark Roper music
A meat slapper machine sounds something suspicious you could buy as an fmachine...
get ready for  tape worms brudah
Winner winner chicken dinner
you succumbed and used celsius.  need to revoke your america card after this.
One of my mother slap can cook that chicken instantly
In an alternate universe, this is the standard way to cook chicken.
Me looking for a Justin Y comment
Reminded me of the *_chicken thrown in this video_* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2rNnzVotS0&fvfvre
lol im so childish he said meat beater hahaha
Me:....  Louis: I have some cooking oil, it's not like really lube, but I think it'll so we are cooking after all.  Me: Pssst!!!!        ....        Well, I guess that was true...
Idk who you are, but this reminds me of mark rober's vids!
Damn you just made a new cooking method
Unus Annus would be proud. o7
This man probably ate the very first meal cooked with slaps in history, this is a peak human achievement, we only go down from here.
next : boil a soup using kinetic energy
There’s a really cool invention called an oven, u should try using it sometime .
Attach solenoids to pizza chefs
Would it have been better to do the Nikola Tesla route with a resonant design? Use that mass inertia and cancel it out with a spring and use a linear solonoid to drive it at resonance? Take inspiration from the LC or LLC converter in electronics to regulate the energy per slap
He took "Beat my meat" too seriously
*CONGRATS!*
They called him a madman
If Shaggy was a genius
HELL YEAH LOUIS GIMME A HIGH FIVE
Did anyone else get Mark Rober vibes from this?
Me: “so you’re telling me the next time I’m disrespected I could cook some dude with my bare hands.”
First step towards human innovation
He was lying because he go out and take a cooked meat
This guy is quite literally beating his meat
A cheap Mark Rober?
I mean it started at 40°c but this machine has huge potential
Animal abuse.....    😅😅😅
i want to be cooked with slaps
One day you will cook this chicken with super slap 🔥
Makes me wonder, would it have been more efficient if you out the chicken in a tiny metallic box and then slapped the balls of the box. That way all the heat would be contained inside the box like a little oven and we don't have to directly slap and damage the chicken.
Meat beater 9001 revaluationizing the kitchen
Next question: How many slaps does it take to get my wife to cook my chicken?
This man is the new Michael reeves
When you dont have oven at home:
1:56 AYO THATS sUs
I couldn't eat that, there's something just...wrong
idk if it’s the music or the way his video style is but his videos remind me so much of mark rovers videos
I got a Popeyes ad lol 💀💀
This looks fake af
Lol I’m so happy I didn’t watch the entire video, this was very surprisingly unentertaining.
I need myself a meat beater 9000 🧐😂
“That’s the scale used for real science” No Louis, that’s the scale used by everyone except Americans.
Got to dislike the video. When you use the devils measurement you always lose.
I had a feeling Peter would be involved
Well humanity did it boys
Lol the chicken died for this
sir pass me that meat beater  sir: but its not for sale  SIR PASS ME THAT MEAT BEATER
Celcius.
Slapping meat
Hello Salmonella
Unus Annus fans remember this 😭
He wanting to get Mark Rober using his music, you're gonna do it!!! You're the best! But it's so fun, you're vids are edited exactly the same way
Tutorial on how to make white people chicken
Omg I’m glad I found this video, I watched the previous ones and I thought you gave up, glad you didn’t😂👏🏻👏🏻
Finally
👾
anyone else think they mis-clicked on a Mr. beast video when yall heard his voice for the first time? Crazy resemblance
no herbs and seasoning?
Jello's question has been answered
Unus Annus did it better. RIP
You did it you mad lad! you did it!
That is chicken?
Davie 504 will be so proud
Wuakala
Next time you should use aluminum parts in place of wood.
this man is a perfect blend of mark rober, william osman and michael reeves
i guess you finally did it congrats.
Mark rober style video
you've made my whole god damn day
So u telling me, that i can cook My gf ass
“We’re evolving, just backwards” never has this phrase struck more true than this moment. Fire was invented for a reason hahahahahaha
MEAT BEATER 9000
This is a master class in moving the goal post. Well done.
i got a kfc chicken sandwich ad before the vid
How hard do you have to slam a door on a chicken to cook it
I think I just found Simone Geirtz 2.0
No, not Celsius use in proper science omg, it’s Kelvin
Have you thought about balancing the arm?
Mars yard kiiiiidddd
Where's Vasily Kamotsky when you need him
so u didnt cook a chicken. u suk
F
Nice rice cooker you have there buddy
12:45 well that look terrible to an Asian
I got an add gojo hands burning lmaoo
My god... They said it was impossible... But he... He surpassed god levels...
from air frying to impact cooking
Pause meat beater??
can it be good for grandma and grandpa who do not have their teeth or weak jaws? (you seemed to have tenderized it and literally heat)
The mad man actually did it.
My mum cooked my face by slapping it
Its finally done
Perhaps you could deliver the slaps with a huge solenoid.
Is this new mark robber lol
Takes bag to bathroom...comes back with the same bag???
QED
As a vegetarian this is really disturbing ☹️
You need to let it go for longer
Man has yet again broken another barrier seemed impossible. How far shall we go before we finally learn our limit as a species?
i like how this is a similar channel to mark rober and uses the same music
Ladies and gentlemans he's got it!!!
He literally created a meat beater
I'm pretty sure Davie504 approves this.
how
Bolts breaking... Sounds like a good time to learn about bolt grades.
Try a baby next
The absolute madman 👍😂
0:56 sounds like Mark Rober explaining because of the background music.
I would have figured a water wheel slapper, or jack hammer, or let it get hit by a piston head. The impact and vibration did not play nice with the slapper
I watch TheRussianBadger, so when I saw this in my recommended, I became the fastest clicker in the west.
This Man COOKED A STEAK BY SLAPPING IT!!!      *IN A CAVE! WITH A BOX OF SCRAPS!!!*
I challenge you to cook spaghetti sauce using nothing but a slap-chop.
Chickens watching: F*ck mates were done here in earth.
I kind of want a perfect demo run video of the MB9001.5 but *this deserves a Nobel peace prize*
Science has gone so far...too far...
Cooking oil was created as light machine oil, canola oil for instance was an industrial oil until massive surpluses after the war made for creative thinking by Canadian farmers and oil producers.  Now thanks to a surplus in Canadian light machine oil.. you call it cooking oil.
Why is the king pewdiepie in the backround???
So beating the meat will end up cooking it... 🤔🤔
Reminds me of the game spaghet where you have to keep spaghetti warm by slapping it while avoiding monsters or you die
you literally turn kinetic energy to thermal energy to cook a chicken
we made a meme actually happen-
so why didn't the pig innards cook in minecraft?
MAKE A RESTURANUNT THAT ONLY SERVES FOOD COOKED BY SLAPPING!
Bro cooked three chickens and a steak and didn't season one of them mfs
Yo... I was watching this on 100 volume on public... they thought i was watching on PH lols
This guy: **cooks a chicken by slapping it**  3.5m ppl: "Sounds good let's give it a watch"
Yoooo it’s done
Can I have some lol.
I know it doesn't look that good right now, but watch this. *Pulls out flamethrower*
*davie504 wants too know your location*
oh... so this comment i saw a while back wasnt just trying to be funny  haha
Mark rober song = mark rober vibes
This is unbelievable! Go science!
He should do a video of him cooking it by slapping it with his hands. It cant be that hard to slap 135000 times
OH MY GOD FINALLY
Collab with Guga wen?
We can die in peace. Now I'm starving.
Who is smarter?  These guys  - cooked a chicken by slapping it  Einstein    - didn't cook a chicken by slapping it
This YouTube video and channel reminds me of Mark rober
That steak was "cooked" by yank standards but in the civilized world we'd call that fookin RAW
@kyle hill
Hell nah. I only eat well done.
Why not season it first and SLAP it again for 60°C
Bruh.  You know you have to eat that chicken eventually.   Weirdly epic series. Thank you for everything.
What if he just left the room and swapped an uncooked steak for a cooked one and all of us who are too stupid to understand the science behind it just believed it?
A like for the honestly
I don't comment or like anything. ... but you sir.. deserve it. have a comment.(and a like.)
Gordon would not approve
i been waiting. nice doo
🖤🤍
9:20 JD
"Celsius" used in real "science"!?       *BLASPHEMY!!!* I see I'm going to have to take up arms in another Holy Crusade and teach a heathen the true path of Imperial Measurements. Do not fret my child, I will soon cleanse your sinful mind of it's heretic nature.
Would’ve been more efficient to use the motors heat lol
I was so worried about this... I just didn't wanna feed my family raw chicken
I should be sleeping but I’m watching this man slap some meat. 🥴
Just why tho, pretty neat ngl
"Do you want to eat my ass?"  "Ok, but let me cook it first" *proceeds to slap it for 100k time"*
Yes!!!
History has been made
I almost cook my meat then. Thanks, so I know my limit
The rich kid: Alright let's replace everything with carbon fiber.
He didnt have to do the hidrolic press channel like that in the intro
anyone else got huge mark rober vibes during this vid?
This seems like something you’d see in an episode of Mr. Bean.
You know it’s good when you hear the Mark Rober music
We're In America. Use Fahrenheit
Lol who would have thought so much cooling/heat dissipation would be necessary to finish cooking something...
This takes dedication
can soemoen please explain how the steak had a sear on it?
Man I love the internet!
Meat beater:exist Me:R U CHALLENGING ME
So what do you do for a living? Oh Im a professional meat slapper ya know?
This does for sure answer one of the oldest  and most important questions in all of science...: what is the most complicated and least efficient way of cooking a chicken?
You sir get a subscription
Youve gotta collab with gordon ramsey to make a slap cooked meal
What if he makes a restaurant and they cook the meat this way
I turned into an NPC watching this NPC. GTA is real life.
O wasted 2 mins of my life looking at this shit
Send to Mark and Ethan
Steak wasnt seared and it was eaten with a plastic fork, but ITS DONE WOOOOOOO
The part 2 i wasnt expecting but the part 2 I desperately needed
I love the ltt reference so much
nope not the only chicken . The Hacksmith made a project of a rocket slapped . For a test , they slapped a chicken , and it got cooked , so , technically ....
Finally
Peep the mark rober effect
love the adam mention now a fan 😎
What a waste
Mans just mark rober- he talks like him, uses same backround music , and only uploads 12 vids a year
you need to put the chicken in a lower spot to be slapped! so the chicken  doesnt get hit so hard and will make the slapper go faster and create more heat.  I'm out!
1950s: *We will have flying cars in the future* 2021:
Davie504 is sweating
The meat beater 9001
I've been waiting for somebody to do this for years thank you so much
That thumbnail is so misleading
Davie504: Do you want to borrow my Holy slap?
so thats why gordon ramsay slaps meat, too cook it since its raw
he busted out the engineer music 0:58
Punch and slap... until it is DONE
Davie504 can cook a chicken faster with his Slaps.
This guy took the term "Beating my meat" in a whole new level...      *It's a chicken but whatever.*
I can't wait
So if the Flash wanted to...
Medium rare heathen
I thought Kelvin was used for real science. While Fahrenheit was used for culinary. And Celsius is for practical reasons like determining how cold water is or the temp of the environment/weather. Celsius is also for when you hate Fahrenheit(which I hate).
Now THIS is  what youtube is all about
that background music. I assumed Louis got it from Mark Rober
He wasn't confident enough to season it, I mean he'll buy a bunch of chicken but have you seen the prices for spices
how tf is this in my recommendations, still interesting tho
Ahhh the music, mark rober vibes
Davie504 Just want to eat this steak...
Can you install one of these in a Tesla Truck...just need a cup holder adapter??  Also, you just proved how a microwave works...by slapping the water molecules into each other and heating up your food.
Haha. Meat beater
crackhead mark rober vibes
This gives a whole new meaning to beating the meat
this video gives new meaning of beat the meat lol
*SLAP*
Now cook a bass by slapping it
This slaps
Louis: 69420 slap  Davie504: EPIC!
Rip
of course u didn't season the chicken
slap sous vide
The rich keep us poor because they know we'll answer the questions no one is brave enough to try
Now cook it with only one slap!
That is one tender fuckin chiken
You should have added a fly wheel because nobody likes flies on their chicken.
I really want to try the slapper steak. I dont care if it's bad at this point I just gotta know
Bro this Chicken SMACKS!!!
Someone send this to russianbadger
Hahaha can't believe it 🤣🤣🤣
Davie504 would like to know your location...
YESSSS HE DID IT
This is true American cuisine
No live chickens were harmed during this experiment.
>celsius >not kelvin >"""real science"""
I lowkey want to see Michael Reeves cook a chicken with tazers
This guy sounds like Mr beast
So you cooked the steak 2/3rds of the way? That's literally cheating not impressed at all.
*no cost too great*
Mars yard 2.0 tester???
Mark rober music lol
THANK GOD
1:22
The mad lad he really did it people said it was impossible but he did what a chad
I would slap the chicken with a hot frying pan. It would need far fewer slaps
Jello from russianbadger gonna be happy!!
That steak looked real good
Nobody:  Every car guy when the go to work on their project car: 6:11
I'm sorry to tell you this..... the Mongols have been slapping their chickens and steaks with their horses butts for a long time. If ya know ya know
myth: confirmed
this idea has been in my head since childhood
I wonder if a wheel with multiple rubber flaps would work better?
Stealing mark Rober’s audio
That looks more like a stomper than a slapper. I was expecting a rotating machine with about a dozen rubber fins (like swim fins) that literally slap the meat. You already have a rotary motor that you’re changing into up-and-down motion. And it should be easier to adjust the power by simply raising or lowering the fins and adjusting the speed.
OMG you didn't give up from the last video!
I thought the steak was liquefied
How did this get 3.5m views in 3 days? Woah 😳
anyone else just like randomly pausing to read the chat?
How many slaps to boil water. Good luck figuring out the kinetic energy displacement of water added to heat loss
is it just me or is he a white mark rober
This is like a cursed Mark Rober Video
I have been waitin for this video xD
Is this what engineering is?
The plateau is the temperature where you started rendering the fats in the meat. As it melted there was a phase change where heat was absorbed without raising the temperature.
We need a collaboration with the russian badger where he eats a chicken cooked by slaps 🤣
Now feed it to Gordon Ramsay
unus annus UNUS ANNUS
Me thinking something else ehen saying original meat beater
Thanks for having the degrees in Celsius as well :)
Based and slappilled.
I highly doubt that stake was cooked with the slap machine.
"Flash can be a master cook just using speed!"
If someone called and asked what he's doing, he prolly said he's beating his meat
If someone called and asked what he's doing, he prolly said he's beating his meat
Someone who is better at physics than me, how much did the temperature increase per slap and what was the force of one slap
Thank you Unus Annus
I didnt follow the stream or anything like it. But why didnt you opt for a piston design? Instead of the slap being an downward arc slap, go for a horizontal or vertical sumo slap. I.e. Like a jackhammer.
Now he's using a good temperture mesuare
He uses the same music as mark rober
This guy really hated the invention of ovens...
this is the video that made me go vegetarian
So, if we can kill bacteria by not slapping as hard, but slapping for longer, how long would I have to slap for, if I slapped at 3 m/s, if I were to slap with my hand twice every second? Thanks!
This reminded me of Grouse from Russian Badger asking how hard you would have to punch a chicken to cook it.
Walk inna Kfc in 2050: bruh gimmie chicken Behind the counter:
This makes me think of history and if people ever did this to cook their food. Imagine if ancient people built slapping wheels to cook some foods. Maybe you could slap some sort of jerky type meat. Yumsters
I wish i had time for this kinda shhh ❤️😎♥️
They called him a mad man ...he fucking did it just fucking awesome
So the conclusion is no? You can't cook a chicken w a slap, unless u have a vacuum sealed bad, a slapping rig, 3/8" hardned steel pole, built in motor and a lot of other shit lol
where's davie504??
People in the 1890's: I bet in the future, we'll have flying cars!           2021: *MEAT SLAPPER*
8:17 when you find a better video after beating your meat
He did it boys, he actually did it.
*ADJUSTABLE SLAP DEPTH*
The heat bag was the best suggestion.
Would not be surprised if this had a demand in the deviant dominatrix market

beat meat
😳     1:04
Me: wanted to cook.  Google:put it in the oven. Bing:
So I really can beat my meat too fast...
He’s really passionate about beating his meat.
JonTron: But why? Why would you do that?
Absolute Madlad
now do it in one slap
I'm glad I finally understand the temperature 🥺
Me in the beginning of the video NOO  Me at the end YESS ITS OVER 9000

Is it just me who thought “is that the mark rober music in the back????”
They called him a mad man...but look at him now...
Davie504 could cook this in no time.
Stove companies looking at this real sweaty
When you go to engineering school so you can make things less efficient
Technically the temperature scale you use for REAL real science is kelvin, and we all know this is REAL real science
The steak is basically just suis vie without a reverse sear
Meat Beater 9001.... 💀💀
Imagine being the chicken and knowing this is what's going to happen to you.
When you slapped so hard that you kill the bacteria
This takes beating your meat to a new level....
I'm so proud of you all. This is some serious dedication in the name of scientific breakthrough
u sound like that guy in youtube. u even got that background music like him.
Now someone write a paper, all information already there. Can publish a paper with title "cooking using slap" 😆
This is called the meat beater?  I've got one of those.  🤣🤣
This guy reminds me so much like Mark Rober
He did it! He just did it! He dindn't let his dreams be dreams. He DID IT!
Made me laugh when I seen that the hydraulic press channel commented
Imagine being raised and killed for meat only to get clapped on by a robot called "the meat beater 9000"
I wonder how much money he spent on this project 🤔💭
Beats cooking lol.
There's not enough slap chick-humor in this vid.
What is this sorcery!
Tony Stark could do this in a cave with a box of scraps!
That steak was bearly above blue at best, good work though

Okay WTF did I just watch 😂😂😂 ❤️

can't believe you didn't eat it

As my dad use to say, "Quit beatin your meat son."
Dude congratulations, you finally did it! I'm proud
The madlad actually did it!
These algorithm suggestions are out of control
celcius? i think you mean kelvin? using negative integers to represent thermal energy? that's how you end up with funky math.
hi
Yooooooo Dracula!  How disgusting, you are eating that bloody meat!  Don’t get “sick o’ cell”!!!
"Original meat beater"....... Ha, your mom.
Okay, now get to the tootsie center of a tootsie pop by licking it.
Mark rober wants to know your location
How would Gordon Ramsay react to this?
This takes the term "beet my meat" to a whole another level
So this is what you meant by ground pound.
Warning : professional idiot, do not attempt 😂
ooh yeah my boy adam ragusea
We still don’t know how many licks it takes to get to the center of a tootsie pop and this guy over here slapping chicken? Welcome to 2021. Never thought we’d b here 🤦🏾
I've never watched your channel before but I was eyeing the plane in the back and was like "that's a peter stripol special" and low and behold I didn't read the description cuz there he is
i see you are fellow dirt head, rad
kewl
haha 3.3M views in 2 days, on slapping chicken. what a time to be alive
Hey you should reach out to Guga Foods to try cooking a wagu steaks with it
is the great value mark rober?
You don't even offer a good talking point
We’re really all here just watching this chicken getting it’s cheeks clapped huh
You mean nothing
Jesus Christ is Lord God of all! God bless you all! Nothing, and I mean NOTHING, is too difficult for the Lord our God, with Christ, ALL things are possible!

Slap That Damn Chicken!
"And the 2021 award for the greatest scientific achievement goes to...
Or hear me out you can use a grill or a stove which takes 15 minutes instead of 2 months
Imagine being the chicken that sacrificed it's life to be cooked like this
You succeeded where Unus Annus failed. They can rest a tad bit easier now knowing this has been done
Now this is trending material
He shouldn’t go to Harvard, Harvard should go to him
How would you like your steak? Medium slap please.

Kto jd spamił XD
Nice clickbait.  Video did not look as it did in thumbnail.
Where are davie 504 fans. Slap like now
Nobody likes medium rare chicken
I just watched 13 minutes of some dude straight beating his meat. And I don't regret anything.
Wow
When they lie to you about your degree.
EPICO 🔥
I'm happy that I followed this incredible story all along
Calling Russian badger
..... I wanna try it.....
this guy is like the meme version of mark rober
Holy crap you guys finally did it
Gordon Ramsey is shitting himself
i only have one thing to say: "the original meat beater"
Meat beater
1:53 what a blast
Not only has it cooked that steak is the most texturized steaks ever
any one else think of unus annus 😭
Fahrenheit for freedom. 'murica
I actually teared up while watching.  There's hope for humanity!
Man decides to eat his meat after beating it.
where do i buy
Davie can cook it with one slap
I've already trashed my microwave and oven in anticipation of this innovative new technology
All of that, just to prove to his mom that he can Live By himself without buying a oven
Wtf 165 its 185 in canada for pultry.  Is this the acceptable food standard of america.
In the process, we have created a new culinary science. Science gastronomy. Get ready for the new gen of restaurant

Cook some other stuff~
Blowimatron fans be like:  “WE BE BLOWING DAT CHICKEN!!!!!”
Lol drop something from super high up polverise.  And dude may be "cooked"  but food safty still an issue 4 sure.  Hope u didnt get sick.

Mark rober jr?
did i just watch a 13 minute video of someone beating their meat? yes
Anyone else wondering what the specific heat of chicken is? And about how many slaps that is?
Whats next? Flying cars more like frying cars...
Step aside Bill Gates we have a new tech trailblazer on the scene
So theoretically you could cook any meat by slapping it
Who would win: An animal rights organization Or one slappy boi?
I wish i have the determination this guy have
Me: Mum, can we have Mark Rober? Mum: We have Mark Rober at home. Mark Rober at home:
my dreams of medium rare nuggies is coming to fruition
That poor motor
It gets hot, beating your meat.
Unus Annus would be very proud
Me and my smartass thinking what would happen if I put my hand in it.
BLOWIE-MA-TRON!!!!!!!!
This like a fusion  reactor,  the atoms slap one another at high  speed that create energy  Here it is also  speed .. since a shock create collision  of atoms , the energy  deployed  create  warmth although  the heat  is dissipating  because  a shock  isn't long , the repetitivity of shocks create  continuous heat as it has no time to dissipate 😁 But damn  i must say, that chicken  looks deliciously slaped
He said “Meat beater” Damm I need one 😏
Mom: So, what did you do yesterday? Me: I finally witnessed someone beat his meat so much that he cooked it.
My mom will be so proud.
Is this real?  I’m pretty sure that was a steak...
Mark Rober's music makes it more professional✨
How many slaps would it take to cook a human?
I came here by memetastic
That dude who made the original joke of superman being able to slap a chicken hard enough to cook must be so proud right now 🥲
I like well done but cool
in a parallel universe, cook by slap is the norm. and some mad lad youtuber came up with the crazy idea to cook his food using convection
All of human achievement has lead up to this moment
Now i know how many times i can slap my gf's butt. So glad i don't have any.
I-Impossible!
for the love clucks just cook it like normal people...use depleted uranium pried from the hands of a stalker in Chernobyl reaktor No.4
He did it
Anyone else notice the music that’s ALSO used in Mark Rober’s videos?
*unus annus flashbacks*
Hey he’s also using the music that mark rover uses
YouTube at its finest yeeesh
Tootsie pop guy: Mr. Owl, how many slaps does it take to take to cook a chicken?  Mr owl: Let's find out. 1...2hoo....3......eh, more than 3.
Just watched   teenagger   use simular elect motor   for gamming    shook the pc  across the table    added Rumble effect xd
but did he season it ..
Def swapped the steak out... Shouldn't of left the camera
Imagine being a chicken, killed just to be abused with slaps
Dang I'm surprised there weren't any people saying how this reminded them of [REDACTED]
Davie504 needs to see this
“They called me a mad man”
Chicken slapper 2: the slappening!
Ok now broil a salami sandwich with slaps
Anyone who disses Hydraulic Press Channel gets 👎. Plus bad editing makes this look faked.
3:30 I was in the chat when we hit 69,420 and the energy was INCREDIBLE
Wait wait wait... youre working with Peter?? How did I not know this?!
#therussianbadger
Video was good, I enjoyed it, but can we stop with they hype beast "let's go!" catchphrase?
The way intellectuals beat meat
Celsius isnt as scientific as Fahrenheit... Fahrenheit gives  much more accurate temp.
Alternate Title: Slapping meat in order to cook it.
My parents hear the words from my room: “Meat beater 9001” and then consistent beating noises. My parents will disown me
@Gordan Ramsey
Can we get Jello to see this, it has the answer to his question.
10:00 mmm tenderized meat
nice
I couldn’t stop launching the entire video heating the chicken get slapped
I thought you were gonna say; “Honestly, IT SLAPS”😂
My classmates be like: do you beat your meat? Me:
Is this the new Mark Rober
So you didnt actually do it then did u
They say beat the meat... well, this another level of beating the meat.
I would have used something like epdm (polynorbornene) to improve the efficiency of the conversion of kinetic energy to heat.
smell is like a stake
Guga Foods better react the shit out of this attempt to Sous Vide a steak, by slapping it.
69420. Really hitting all the bases, huh?
This is like t-bagging in COD
This is hilarious 😂
His first mistake was not adding seasoning. This are unacceptable results.
Now do it Manually
Annnnnnd we're back peeps.
You never did a successful run where you ate the chicken though. I'm sorry
Pretty sure all bacteria died after them smacks😂
Time to take this off the list of "questions scientists still can't answer"
"Meat beater" my man. You weren't supposed to do that.
"Im just saying, if physical energy could be turned into thermal energy, how hard would i have to punch a chicken to cook it" -jello, 2020
kinky
I can't help but notice you went off camera before showing the steak, and the chicken
Literally did not cook an *edible* chicken
mark rober be like hm future nasa scientest here
Cooking oil makes absolutely terrible lubricating oil, just fyi. It gets sticky fast.
i don't care about my time and for that reason, i'm here
Unnus anuus already did this but its still amazing
Good idea but it didn’t work so good on eggs.
They said it could not be done...
I burnt the skin beneath my testicles
But Why??
10:03 Hell nah
I just saw a video where two songs matched up in beats per minutes.... as I said there... cool story bro.
Uh.....uhhhh....memento mori?....
You thought that CPR was hard? NOT anymore.
Challenge Davie504 to a slap battle
That is the best thing ive seen in a while
Me: wants to make a chicken Bing:
Alternate title idea... Beating my meat until cooked and eaten
hot chicken
True definition of beating your meat
I can't believe my comment made it into the video, even if it was just to call my idea bad lmao
Davey504 believes in the power of the slapp.
Why didn't you just do a vertical slapper like a piston of a engine? Less friction and easy slaps
I want Gordon Ramsay to roast this
At last ...😂😂
I went from mildly curious to very invested in how you solved the Big Slap problem. Great work! We now have evidence about slapping a chicken to cooked.   Can you try this with other meats and eventually a person (how many slaps can someone withstand)
The original meat beater 😂
now, can you set the chicken on fire
So everyone is talking about beating the meat but is also worried that the choice of temperature scale is not sophisticated enough. *sigh* Still, nice engineering project!  Good work.
This is how dedicated this guy is to eating meat lmao
As an engineer and cook, just put the steak or chicken on the effing grill
1:56 What the hell was that!?
Idea, hook up a 3”x4’ sheet of plastic to a fly wheel on a engine and turn it on, should be able to achieve your goal faster and more reliably.
This is the best video than I have seen  this  year.
We are nearing the peak of evolution  Until now  We have gone beyond
YOU DID IT! FINALLY!
Mans is as powerful as Goku god damn
Should open a restaurant. Special delicacy. Slapped Chicken.
1:05 “the original meat beater...” Me :pog:
165 F
You did it, you son of a bibbi you did it
UNNUS ANNUS, UNNUS ANNUS!
Physics ftw
I knew someone would eventually do  this but goddam, I'm glad i get to see it
This is Mythbusters on Twitch
This is Mythbusters on Twitch
3725,95 mph, like if you know what im talking about
Imagine dying in the worst way possible in a slaughter house, then this happened to your body
ryland adams. once you see it you cant unsee it...
McDonald's new item: slapped chicken.
Nobody:  Me at 3am:
Its 3:30 am in my country rn i found this video What the actual fucq and why di i remember the slap the spaghet horor game
Calling BS on the steak. It's appearance would be like you'd microwave it - grey and unevenly heated.
Restaurants now need a slapping option
If that works we should industrialize it. Imagine how freakin tender it would be.
F>C
So if i smash a girl fast enough...
We gonna talk on how he used the Soundtrack Mark Rober uses 🧐? Haha great video tho
i have no clue why this appeared on my recommended, but i *love it*
WHATTA GLOWUP
Legend
Davie504 has entered the chat
U said that the texture is like its been chewed...it would really help the elderly whi cant chew nicely right? Try asking a 50-60 y/o persons opinion
2nd Mark Rober XD
keep on slappin that chicken
why u dont do anything like a "guilhotine slapper", idk but seems it gonna take less damage to the chicken
The thing that hurts me the most is that he won’t season his chicken 😂
Reminded me of Mark Rober lmao
10:41 that beef looks more like a chuck roast which are notoriously tough and chewy if they are not cooked for hours in a Crock-Pot or roaster.
I like dis
HOW DID I MISS THIS
now we gotta find the opposite of a slap to make icecream... Inverse slap? slap milk while holding an uno reverse card?
How did you even manage to beat your meat for that long?
"The original meat beater"
2:15 real scientists use Kelvin. It’s nice because many people don‘t know how to use Kelvin.
"The original meat beater" You called?
Time for a collab with @davey504
Now that a meat beater.
coming soon to a restaurant near you
This video would be a lot shorter if he did not use wood for making everything tbh.
Meat beater
Do punch next then call the Russian badger
Mythbusters would be proud, so would Unus and Annus.
Congrats man. I been rooting for you from the beginning and you finally did it! 🙌🏾
beating your meat to cook it, interesting
You actually did it, like, wow, cheers man!
@0:08 the only chicken in the world cooked by the power of SLAP...  Hmmm.. maybe #Davie504 can cook this too.. SLAP!!!
Redo of Chicken SLAPS!
The meat beater 9001! Let me show you its features! HA HA HA
Uhm.. well, CONGRATULATIONS
Science
This guy gives beating his meat a whole other meaning
Her: he’s probably cheating Him:
2019 : how many slaps does it takes to cook a chicken  2021 : we built a machine that slaps heat into shit
I almost threw up looking at that chicken
Meat Beater over 9000
Hope you had a nice shit. 60c chicken is uncooked and has alot of bacteria left, chicken should never be rare for healthpurposes.
this mans doing the lords work right here
Mark rober #2
The future in a nutshell
10/10, would slap here again
lmao
Where's Davie??
This must be what my upstairs neighbors are doing up there while I’m trying to sleep
POV:you came here because a meme
May the jokes begin.
Ahh, Mark Rober's background music..
Slapchop all grown up
That steak would be $2000.
The plateau in temp is called the stall. Where water in the meat is evaporating keeping the temp stagnant.  As the water vapor in the meat is released the temp then continues to rise. Very common when smoking brisket.
Beating your meat then eatting it
“The meat beater 9000”  I just call it my hand
I knew I liked this channel, but then I saw the "subscribe to pewdiepie" in the back and knew I loved it
If you're gonna say 50 "cees" you better fucking say 70 "efs"
This is beyond science
The next mark rober
You did it you SOB You actually did it
Hey nice palace t shirt
Is dis mark rober AHahahzha the bgmmm
Davie504 want to know your location and your machine
That steak is undercooked.
Your supposed to choke not slap the chicken
Uhm, I thought Mark Rober was about to show up with the background music playing lol
So human civilization has peaked it's all down hill form here.
mark rober music???
Jebać disa xD
9:23 jebać disa went international
Beautiful
unus annus flashbacks😔
I don't know how I got here but I'm not sad.
Mom whats for dinner? Slapped chicken
Can everybody vote MAX FOSH for london mayor
congrats
David504 is proud of the power of your slapp
Wow after all the video i watched I like that you made it possible and thanks to everyone who supported you
do not wait to strike the chicken until it is hot, make it hot by striking!
Unsatisfactory ending. I wanted to see the chicken being eaten!
Disgusting yo...
he literally beat that meat
Why are we not mass producing this?  This is true science.
Modern Mongolian
Just noticed the Mars yard 2.5! Insane
1:05  The original meat beater
Need the power of Davie504
Saw the old video when it came out skip to today and I see the title and I was like naaaa than saw it was released 2 days ago and I knew I had to watch! Woooy
“Faster slap rate”    Yes
You really had to add that shitty music Mark Rober has in his videos. Good video though.
I feel like Davie504 needs to see this.
man this guy is crazy fun..and fuckkkkking smart too
This is a extraordinary scientific breakthrough
lol its literally 2 qm when im watching this clip
I like your funny words magic man
Slap?!! Davie504 Approves
Me at 2 am be beating my male chicken faster this this
A new chapter in humanity
Still doesn't slap as much as the popeyes chicken sandwich
I thought that Tony Stark is just a movie character...
12:40 He has a rice cooker?! Fuiyoh!!!
Young mark rober
This video was pretty much just "This broke, so I reinforced it with Super Ultra Grade Vibrainium"
He called his thing " Meat Beater "           Man we all have that
Make the arm coaxial so when the slap goes down, a counter arm will go up acting as a counter weight to make more efficient and less damaging to components. My proposal should make it look like an X.
The year is 2090 microwaves have become non existent you throw your left overs into the slapmaster 9000 for three minutes on high
I feel like you only coocked it by a technicality.  You are kiding yourself here.
UM YOUTUBER BRASILEIRO JA FEZ ISSO
New definition for "using a machine to beat my meat"
*Title says slapping* Davie504: N I C E
It’s official: we have way too much time on our hands.
"Louis? Simone"  "Simone? Louis"
Imagine he did this with his hands
Sorry thought this was Mark Rober
Bro i remember seeing the reddit livestream, i was there for day 1
Slap dat chicken
Can this make mochi?
This is more fake than the moon landing
you ripped off mark rober's music?  laaaaaaaaaaame
Davie504 would buy this machine to cook his chicken
You should put meat in aluminum foil, results will be much better and faster
Try punching it next time for extra crispiness
Chicken Slapping is clearly the future of haute cuisine.
Beating that meat
I AM SO HAPPY ! YOU DID IT !!!
No seasoning, of course
This man had tested against science    And won
Props to you and I get sponsors get you money, but the concept of Hello Fresh is so fucking retarded. You can google recipes, go get the ingredients, and do the same thing for probably a lot cheaper than paying for some service to prepackage and portion your shit for you. That’s quite literally the only difference from using that service and just regular meal preparing, the actual acquiring of the ingredients. I guarantee you do the math and you’d be miles cheaper getting everything separate from a store. Nothing against you and the vid tho, I remember seeing this meme and seeing it brought to life is quite incredible
Scientists in the year 3000: *what was this machine used for, what was its purpose*
Davey504 is shaking
jotaros ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA would make dio hot
Eeee
9:25 polska gurom
IF YOU MASTER THE HERTZA HAEON YOU COULD DO IT IN ONE SLAP
They should use this in Russian slap boxing🤣
The science... it’s... perfect
People: Do something that americans dont like Americans: *COMMIE* say whatever you want in the replies I'm gonna have lots of Americans cussing me off
I REMEMBER THE PREVIOUS OMG-
Huhhh, nepoleon dynamite anyone?
Wpuld a like 2 blade rotating fly sweater style slapper work.
that's a really strong *meat beater*
Crazy to see how the channel blew up since the last slap the chicken
Woah, #43 on trending??? Good job man!
Okay but how often do you have to drop a chicken to cook it?
Then he died of food poisoning
He was talking about temps that are actually considered cooked and I was over here saying "so he's cooking it low and slow? Got it."
The meat beater
Maybe the true meat beater 9000 were the friends we made along the way
The only time beating your meat is ok on youtube.... When you're cooking it!
SOMEONE SEND THIS TO RUSSIAN BADGER NOW!!!!!
I usually choke my chicken.
What are the odds I was eating a pizza that I made myself that I learned to make from watching Adam Ragusea videos while watching this video.
hate to tell ya but unus annus did it better
*A D J U S T A B L E  S L A P  D E P T H*
Wow
The stiff japanese unfortunately program because jam laparoscopically rot beneath a purring may. sticky, oceanic september
Finally  Slap chic
A microwave operates by jiggling the molecules in food, you should see if you can cook a chicken by jiggling it
Fire aspect irl
Very interesting
Man, that steak was so tender, you could cut it with a PLASTIC knife
someone get Davie504 in here STAT
This is true science. Screw the theory of relativity, I wanna know how much you need to slap meat to cook it
If you can cook a chicken by slapping it, you must be able to cook your monkey by spanking it???
No the real scale for temperature in science Is rankine. Use that
I wonder what Gordon Ramsay would say...
This video made me subscribe
Imagine this actually becomes a cooking method.  "Hey guys, help yourself to some refreshments. I'll just go beat my meat and dinner will be ready."
Hes answering the real questions
Davie504 would be proud.
Now do with ONLY kinetic energy. No motors or shit.
1st song?
The chicken is real, but the idea isn't original lol
H e LL o F r E S h
"Original meat beater" was not a phrase I anticipated.
Sous vide via slapping... NOICE.
I love how it is called meat beater.
No hate bro but you are a complete copy of Mark Rober you use the same music as him you like to do science , I can’t really see a difference
U should put a flashlight on that jawn
Kudos to doing something no one ever wanted to do ... Interesting science...  Horrible food preparation ...
Just so you know we use Kelvin in real science
I can't believe I can finally answer this question if someone asks me for whatever's reason   Thanks for doing this, I admire your hard work
Man just said meat beater with straightest face possible
First thing that came to mind was Grouse asking how hard youd have to punch a chicken to cook it
Celsius inst the measurement for heat used in science you got scammed
So know we finally know how many times we have to hit a chicken to cook it
Where is Davie504 when ya need him ???
If its pink, its not cooked but my God you really have been at this. Here's a like
Did you ever consider installing a golden grill and a pimp hat?
This whole challenge is a disgrace. Man just cut steak with plastic dinerware.
Build 10 or more of these machines and you are good to go if a few breaks 😂
Bruhhhh I wanna buy a slapper cooker
Please calculate how many calories you would burn if you slap a chicken 135k times
slap steak approximately 35,000 times after removing it from 40 degree sou vide bath. Got it.
This guy kinda looks like Kramer
11:54  Oczy nie zawiodły
1:05 the original meat beater lol
In my opinion, he talks like Mark Rober
Props to Hello Fresh for grabbing an excellent ad market!!
3:30 For the memes
I just saw a community post memeing about this above this vid LOL
This is why the internet exists.
Now put your hand in it
HISTORY
I wonder how vegans feel about this video
In the 21st century we will have flying cars  the 21st century:
The next revolution in culinary innovation
"I'm sorry, but I ordered this steak medium. Could you have the chef slap it around for another 5-10 minutes."
Bro, you know they invented the oven right?
I just watched a man beat his meat for 15 minutes
I am crying I am s happy
THIS is why the internet exists. Thank you, @Louis Weisz
This was actually just an incredibly elaborate, masterfully planned Hello Fresh add
Why not do a steak. Only needs the outside to be cooked lol
you could always make 9002 out of steel instead of wood and run it off of a HF gas engine..
WOW.  Hand on.  You are using the tunes from Mark Rober?  Sorry bub, but once I heard that I had to click off.   No offence to you, I'm sure your content is good, but I don't condone Rober Knockoffs.  I'm sure the music is free, but that's still Rober's theme song.  Like he wakes up and that music starts playing.  He showers and its playing, he eats breakfast and the rober tune is going, he has "quality time" with the wife, and that a montage with that music is generate out of thin air.  That music is Rober, lets leave it with Rober.
The aluminum fatigue limit strikes again
Momento Mori.
Humanity: *did not discover fire* Patrick: We have technology.
........unus annus
when somebody science-y uses mark rober music,   *you know its legit*
next up, can you cook a chicken by choking it !
gonna tell my grandkids about this
Just make sure to not put your balls there instead of the chicken...
The original meat beater yes I’m childish 😂😂😂😂
This brings beating meat to a different level
JUST TRY SOME SCHNITZEL!! I mean you have to beat it anyway :D
The fact that he uses the same music as Mark Rober is amazing to hear
Maybe use a car to cook faster?
mythbusters please hire this guy . he really deserve it
Anyone vibing to mark rovers classic music
No,  real scientist use kelvins
Leave to a skinny white kid to perfect beating his meat. Instead about learning about real life in high school, this kid probably was the only kid actually paying attention to math and science class.
I want to see this in a McDonald's
could have just asked davie504 for some serious slaps.
If you do it again if you blow the air on the motor over ice before it hits the motor that should help
Twitch Chat kept saying Hi to us but I don't see anyone saying hi twitch chat :( so HI CHAT <3

Im so proud of you!! Subbed!!!
Once Mankind has created all there is to create....    ...This is the outcome.
How to beat your meat in the most effective way possible.
Someone needs to send this to Russian Badger
"Hi this is Vince with slap chop"
Imagine the chicken up in heaven looking down at his body right now
You deserved that bravo
This is chicken's hell
U made an automatic meat beater😂
Kelvin is real science smh
This is one of the stupidest, and yet one of the most amazing things I’ve ever found browsing the internet
Bruh terminators boutta deep fry a mfo with a slap 😂 im dead
Finally, a meal that would stand up to Davie504’s standards.
I'm here because of Unus Annus lmao
you did it, you proved the second law of thermodynamics through sheer will power, well done .
Should have just brought in Davie504’s subscribers, one slap from each of them... cooked. 😂
The meat beater 9001?😏 what other uses does it have other then beating chickens😉
So I seen Good Mythical Morning try this first but u actually cooked they didn’t lolz. LIFE HAS MEANING TIME TO START SLAPPING MY FOR PREHEATING!
slappers only
You did it, you crazy sonnuva... you did it!
I mean, I guess that may be good for the environment. Probably.
You could've grabbed a medium rare steak from the back when you were going to dump the juice :O
You seriously deserve an award. I’m not kidding. This is dedication at its finest.
Many have attempted this...unus
I'm the only "Science enthusiast" that find hard to watch this? Like bro that points of failure are obvious 🤦‍♂️
YES HELLO FRESH SPONSOR THIS STUFF YEAH
They should have called it the meat beater 6900
How long would it take to cook if you just chocked the chicken instead?
Go back to Fahrenheit dont let them metric dorks who never won the space race talk shit about imperial
Congrats. Your whole office is now contaminated.
This guy is the next mark rober
Vegans have left the chat
Davie504 would approve.
Damn it Youtube.... what did I tell you about these video suggestions  😂
This is how Davie504 cooks his food 😆
Why am i getting mark rover vibes from this vid
Give this man a speed slapper
“Celcius is used for real science” Laughs in Kelvin
As someone who knows meat well, that was not cooked by Slaps, there is no way. It's obvious it was cooked on a stove. I worked around food alot
Yooooo he actually did it
My god
Team of crackhead engineers
I died when this man said the original meat beater
Science friday brought me here
Ha meat beater
Glad to see this channel finally getting the recognition it deserves went from 50k to almost 400
Davie504 approves...
I was there for all the streams they were fun to watch lol
You’re awesome dude! The world owes you a great debt of gratitude for looking into this meat slapping science.
this plays like a michael reeves and mark rober collaboration
I "tenderize" my chicken by "choking" it.  ✊🐔🌋
I've never heard this question...
Go put some a-1 on it & go crazy
this guy is like mike rober but he actually uploads lmfao
This guy just made a whole 13-minute video on beating his meat
Me who lit my hand on fire: I am 4 parallel universes ahead of you
If it was really cooked by slapping (if that's even possible), the steak wouldn't have a brown outside, it's be all pink (the brown outer layer is caused by the direct heat from the surface ifs cooked on). Quit your bullshit.
Im new to this channel and saw this video just as I woke up this morning. Now I feel like I can achieve anything.
What is your watch????
Not gonna lie, that "i did it!" Was pretty disappointing for me.... I'm super happy you enjoyed it tho
Just hire Davie 504, he would holy slap that chick
Imagine being the person who first asked how many slaps it took to cook a chicken. We probably will never find out who that was.
Can you slap a water until it will be a hot water
just falcon punch lol
That's what I call beating the meat
They took beating your meat to literal 😂
Slapping/spanking is not the best technique for poultry, one must choke their chicken recklessly. If you would like to see a nice 🐔 choked and stroked to perfection with the Stroker Solo (uses shake weight technology)just say the word. How did you get your chicken to lay so still while slapping it? When I choked mine it screamed and flopped even when the head came off. Trial and error I guess.
Unus Annus Unus Annus Unus Annus
Finally
Tá heck?
Now try rubbing it.
the fact that there was a jump cut, when you left room to dump off the juice from the steak, makes it a little suspect of fakery.
Stop spanking your chicken, boy.
1:54   Yo What the FU*K!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I love this
No this is switch bike.
This man broke science
So when getting spanked be careful, if you go too far your arse may be ready to eat.😜
Next up, how to cook by choking the chicken!
Somewhere, in an alternate universe: "I cooked a man by slapping it"
Best video I have seen in a while lmao
That chicken looks like a typical white people dish
Ew. Celcius
yes, that's cool but how many licks does it take to get to the center of a tootsie pop.
This could beat my meat to 60 degrees if you know what i mean
Why
11:54 Czy możemy porozmawiać o jebaniu disa?
They said it can not be done...
Excuse me sir can you please take my chicken back and give it 8 more slaps please
Hand boning will save your life one day...
Back then a group of people would gather in a circle and cook their meals with slaps aka handboning
I THOUGHT "DAVIE 504" IS INVOLVE IN THIS SLAPPING PROCESS😅😅😅😅😅
This guy do be Mark rober tho
Nerd
This is how humans cooked food before fire was discovered.
6:45 don't waste time.
Imagine being killed and your body gets slapped untill it's cooked. lol show this to a vegan
You really didn't have to flex on us wearing the Tom Sachs in an environment such as this but the addition of the toe guards are a pretty nice touch
Mom: what are you watching? Me: a guy beat his meat
It has happened as prophesied!
You what!!!!!?????
Next video: can I cook a lobster using a nuclear bomb?
I remembered senku
what if i put my.... nevermind
I m still remembering the first try that you had  ..i was laughing for days whenever i was visualizing your contraption slapping the chicken ..  To anyone interested to replicate this ...please be aware of salmonella 😂😂
So how do we know you didn't just swap the steaks in the bathroom at the end??? lol jk this is insane
If your are going to do this again I suggest you add a counter weight to your motor
Finally, the youtube algorithm is treating you well, I didn't know if I'd ever see the day.
Momento Mori
Now I know what to do for my science project 👌
The sponsor on this video is gas
for weapon videos:  the skin is too loose, try to clamp it down or something
Underrated
fake i looked it up you would have to slap the chicken 3725.3mph to cook it
I just..... Smoked too much for this 2 not be interesting.
First YouTube video that hasn't been ban for slapping meat.
I nearly mistook this for the first video and almost scrolled past. Luckily I looked at the release date.
This chicken be like: *harder daddy!!!*
so we just watch a man beat his meat...?
i was waiting for "honestly...... it slaps"
Gordon Ramsey should see this.
Bruh next time a teacher asks me to write about my hero im just gonna leave both of the videos' links
I don't think in the spirit of the original ask was to use a one way heat transfer bag...but well done.
👁       👄       👁
Meat Beater 5000
After 2 years, Jello finally has his answer to slapping a chicken to cook it
I love the Rober music hahah
Imagine being a chicken and dying only to be beat thousands of times in front of thousands of people.
we need to get mark rober in this
Meat beater 69000- plays a random meme song every 420 slaps.
“Tastes like you’ve been chewing it for a minute already”😂😂😂
4:51 If I eat uncooked chicken I will get Salmonella. So...if I eat uncooked Salmon, will I get Chickenella??!
I could just imagine the arm hitting the chicken once and it gets stuck and makes the gmod collision noise
I just noticed this today and I have to say I am incredibly proud of you. Keep on slappin homie
and all of this was because one day, a person thought about how much slapping would it take to cook a chicken.
Whole new way to look at useful energy.
This is so confusing. I came to see a chicken, got a steak instead.
my mom always told me to stop slapping my chicken. now i know why  so i wouldnt cook my  you know what
You look like styropyro
Dislike
Hello Fresh meals are complete bullshit, used them and never again. The preparation times are always nonsense, none of them are quick meals.
Literally copied mr.bro
Beat meater 300k
U beat ur meat
Jake at Vsauce 3 would be proud of you <3
i was there
This feels like Mark Rober
2:16 Thanks bro!
Why did I think it said “meat beaner 9000” 😭 (Yes Im Mexican, Twitter don’t cancel me)
1950s: Science at its finest  2021: Am I joke to you?
i honestly can't believe i just watched this whole thing
I lost it at "The original meat beater"
How does the meat actually brown from a slap?
Lesson learned. Kids, if you're ever cold and need some warmth, start slapping yourself.
TAKE THIS @Mr. Bro
As a bbqer may chickins peck your brain out
Thanks to Emkay for having a picture of the thumbnail in one of their videos and then getting this 0ut in my recommended
Chickin smoked at 190-225
My girlfriend always asked this question to me then you uploaded this video on her birthday

CEO of beating meat
The world is circus and I am part of it. If I could chose I wold say NO
springs behind the faceplate of the slapper, There's your power control. just like the shocks of a car you can lower the force with with the body comes down with
So what you're saying is the next time my gf complains she's cold I should slap her 100,000 times got it 👍
1:05 this sounds so dirty
I can't believe he finally did it. This is fucking amazing!
Yeah beat that meat lol
what a madman
Imagine you get born as a chicken then die and some dude slaps you so many times you get cooked
He really likes to beat his meat
this is going to be a meme trust me.
Honestly i think it is blue
Ah yes as old as time

Ok that's  enough  internet for the dau

You're now oficially a slapper
I'm sorry but that steak looked like a giant turd especially with all those juices
Iui
The meat beater eh?
season it next time
So now to see if you put spice's in the meat before hand to make it well seasoned and in grained into the meat

Came here from davie504
*the job is done*
Poor chicken :/
idk what this was really about.. but ive been beating my meat for many many years and i know im really good at it bcuz my steaks done with WAY less slaps. But Gfj bro. You did it! You beat some meat then you ate it afterwards. Id think thats gotta be a first.
This man beat his meat until its cook
A little rare but still good actually
Fucking legend
The mark rober music doesnt fit.
As a vegetarian, i can only say one thing: well done you absolute f*cking legend
Go to 11:15 for results if you're in a hurry

I don’t know but it’s still dose not look cooked through it looks still raw
I was almost impressed except I thought the chicken would be alive
"This bad boy can cook so much chicken"
"In the future we'll have fying cars!"
But can you CHOKE a chicken until it's done??? MMmmhmmmm....
Anyone els think its a little dodgy that he went in to a diferent room to "drain some liquid" (not a hater but just a bit sus)
He did it
yes
Mark robert if he didn’t work for nasa:
Now do it blindfold%
The stake was cooked and tenderd at the same time
Does this counts as a life hack?
What unus annus aspired to accomplish
Slaps a dead bird for hours
One time in my A-Level physics class, a friend was telling about how he and his friends were trying to figure out how hard you would have to slap a chicken to cook it. I looked at that man like he was crazy from that day forward. Now I finally know where he got the idea
Time to apply this knowledge to my everyday life
My man came from trying to create a meat beater to a meat beater.
This is how innovation happens! In years to come we'll all have one of these and wonder why ovens remained relevant for so long.
XDD 11:50 JEBAC DISA
Finally now ill subscribe xD
Wow wow wow. This is so crazy man i remember seeing the first video an thinking it was cool but i kinda forgot about it. Im so glad i found this. Adam savage needs to see this. Lol
Why slap a chicken when you could slap a freshly new bottle of *OXICLEAN!!! GET THE TOUGH STAINS OUT!*
can we take a moment to appreciate he called it the "meat beater"
OMG YESSSS IT HAS HAPPENED!!!
vegans watching this like: 👁👄👁
He did it boys!
Ethan and Mark need to take notes.
He is the middle ground between being a crack addict like Micheal Reverse and a NASA genius like Mark Rober.

You need to eat the chicken or im going to un sub
This is the new mark rober he’s using THE SAME BACKGROUND MUSIC
the celsius comment made me like this
I fucking love the internet. This shit is so weird in the best way possible.
I would be mad if I was a chicken knowing that my whole existence was just to fulfill a dude’s dream of cooking me by hitting me😭
So... how much for an MB9002, a reinforced version?

All vegans hate this vid      Also me:...
Now the question is how many punches does it take to cook a chicken can I recommend a build like a power hammer?

This is fake because if you can cook a chicken by beating it you know fellas they might be millions of our sausages cooked to a crisp lmao
he did what unnus annus couldnt
cant wait to hear them rant about this on the next badger video
This be siense.
i want more chicken slapping.
Season it then slap it.

this video gives me mark rober vibes
Hey, you didn’t mentioned that Peter Sirpol would be here, pretty pleasant surprise.
Bet that dude at 11:55 in the chat feeling really dumb rn

This is what science is for everyone. Nothing else matters
Mad lad.
Lol *MEATBEATER9000* give whoever made the name a raise
This has mad Mark Rober vibes!
Mark Rober is that you?
We have the technology!
Recreate this but make the slaps come from a rotation almost like a high speed water turbine with a bunch of slappers
A bit on the nose using a lot of mark rober music mainstays in the video but I get it
"The Meat Beater 9001" ? ? ? sounds more like something I would see advertised on the Adam & Eve site. btw very entertaining video, sometimes the YouTube algorithm gets is right.
I cannot believe I was just recommended a video of a chicken getting fucking slapped until it was cooked...   ....and I can't believe I just sat through a fucking watched it with an actual interest lmfao.
Dude literally switched the steak when he left the room, lol.

I feel bad for the chicken the chicken TORTURED🤧🤧😓😓😱😱😱😱😅
That's pretty great, hope Guinness puts you in their book for 'First person to successfully cook a chicken by slapping it'
I am pretty sure he using Mark Robers music?

He finally did it
"The meat beater 9001" He beat the meat 135000 times (beat the meat), until it was cooked... Imagine doing that with your hand
"I no longer pollute my food with microwaves. I cook my food with pure and organic slaps"
bruh 69 and 420 has literally took over the world. everyone knows about it, even newborn babies that were just birthed a second ago. i think its kinda bad how everyone is very obsessed with 69420.
He just shot down Hydraulic Press Channel.  Fucking boss.
Its like if we are evolving... Just backwards
Reminds me of someone
I call my right hand the meat beater 9,500z
Its just a wild thought but you could do the slapper like a piston and it maybe wouldnt lose that much heat during the process

I don't think a vacuum chamber would have worked. The vacuum would cause the water in the chicken to boil. And not a good, hot boil.
glad he put the actual temperature after measuring Celsius so i dont have to look it up
Can you find a way to cook a whole chicken only using natural sources, no electricity, in under an hour? And have the skin crispy?
This is what science is all about!

There are a few parts where he sounds exactly like Mark Rober. 🤔

You maniac, you actually did it.
Lmaooo be using the Mark rober music too
He sToLe MaRkS SoNg
Why didn't you just put the motor UNDERNEATH the chicken (using belts and pulleys to emulate the engine's original location)? You could have used the motor's heat to supplement the kinetic heat
new way of cooking, meat beating
At least it's tenderized
What a mad lad. He fucking did it

this means that it is technically possible to cook a chicken using nothing but your hands
It’s finally here boys

...huh, ridiculous as it is... isn't this a kinetic equivalent to how a microwave works? Just with the microwave it's vibrating water molecules.
I'd prefer Kelvin buts it's whatever
He did it?
is that an ****** ******* reference
Someone else did this before I just don’t remember who, maybe mr. beast or Tyler olivera
Reminds me of me in my teenage years
How about how long does it take to heat a chicken via rubbing?
This is not science, this is obviously cooking, thus F was fine!
Next:how many slaps to make fire
Just buy a microwave.
And the idiotically determined spirit of Unus and annus carries on. Momento mori
It’s an honour to watch this 😤
I'm fuvking high as fuvk and I am on like my 4th time watching this.
This needs to be sold commercially!
Davie504 would approve of the ammount of slappage in this
I remember watching the original video on new year’s eve. And now. Finally. *A CONCLUSION*
Chicken slapping machine do be like: "MUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDA- Your chicken is ready, sir."
Next episode slap it with youre hand
Davie504 has entert the chat
Wanted to have consistent slap force - I don't see how that was accomplished. I would use some kind of sealed air cylinder to push it down and use the engine to push it up before it comes down with a nice slap using the compressed air - it should be perfectly consistent force, probably easier to make and maybe more robust as well.
The meat beater 9000
could a chicken be cooked via centrifugal force? hmmm
you are a smarter William Osman
Yesss I might just have to open a restaurant that only serves the finest slap-cooked chicken
Cool to see Peter, even if he never uploads.
Thank you youtube for recommending the finale of this great quest to me!
This man is...     Big brain
wait isnt this how a microwave works just really simplyfied?
If beating the meat was a person
This guy is Mark Rober but puts dumb things with science and still makes it entertaining
The Russians can probably do the same no doubt
Finally something important those stupid scientists exited about a black hole photo not slap cooked chicken
He’s beating his meat til it gets hot
Who’s here to finally have jellos question answered?

Anyone else have no idea what he was explaining, you just wanted to see the chicken cook?
Did He say “cracked team”
You should have gotten it to 69°
Grams and meters are superior but Fahrenheit is far superior than Celsius cuz guess what bois we aren’t water why use a scale based on water freezing and boiling temp
0:47 could that possibly be the Leatherman wave in your hand
9:21 very nice chat
Meat beater 9001 was a genius name
Let’s gioo
It hurt my ears when you said “pasteurised”... to pasteurise anything it has to go through a heat but also cooling process. Heat something is not pasteurisation, sterilisation and homogenisation... just saying
maybe you should try goose liver and make Fois gras. :P
Me camping: How do we make the chicken we can not make a fire!  That one friend who watches you:         *WE SLAP*

Honestly, degree Celsius is just the European unit for temperature. If you really want to use the scientific unit you got to use Kelvin - a physics master student :D

Excuse you, Celsius may be the "real science" temperature but Fahrenheit is the real cooking temperature and this is definitely real cooking.
To the person who wrote Jebać disa in the live chat: I love you

Isn’t that the Mark Rober royalty-free music?
Beating your meat has a whole new meaning, what a time to be alive 👍

Now I would like someone professional (like Gordon Ramsay or my father) to try and cook a meal that kinda _slaps_ ...   (Pun intended)

So your saying if I slapped someone hard enough, I can roast them.
Everything was hypothetical, until youtube.
1:04  meat beater  am dead
It should be easier if you put the chicken in a box, it will be "slapped" from both directions if you do a shaking design.
We choose to slap the chicken in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard
Why did the pervert cross the road? C Because he was stuck to the chicken
Someone give this guy a Michelin star
How dare Gordon Ramsay doubt your genius? He needs to be made aware of this.

Cooked by the power of slap... Davie504 would be proud!
Gordon: how would your like your stake cooked Me: to a perfect 60 degrees, accomplished by 35,000 slaps
Yeah I'd advise against eating chicken cooked with the meat beater, mostly cause while the chicken's proteins coagulate at 60C (140F) its not actually safe to eat. Protein coagulation is a result of temperature only (you can cook for days on a low enough temperature and the proteins wont firm up), but when you are cooking to ensure there's no bacteria (salmonella), it requires both temperature AND time. It is recommended by most food safety officials to cook it to 73C (165F) as usually by the time the proteins reach said temperature, any harmful bacteria will have long since died. Plus with the nature of the meat beater, i imagine it gets unsafe juices all jumbled up.  If 60C was your benchmark, you'd have to keep it held at that temp for a while before any of the proteins actually cook.  In a steak, it's usually fine to cook it any which way you want as the piece of meat isn't generally thick (there are thick steaks, but they aren't roast-thick), it has a low risk of foodborne illness so you typically cook it to your preferred doneness/protein coagulation.  Now you can TECHNICALLY have a medium rare chicken, and while I by no means recommend trying (it would be a nasty texture and still a bit risky) but if you kept it below the meat coagulation for a long enough period of time, it would never over cook. But the bacteria will die off after long enough.
Geuce has his answer
0:58 let the mark rober music BEGIN!!!!
Quite an expensive lunch. I guess anything for Science!
The wood meat beater🤣🤣🤣🤣😂🤪
Thank you for still including imperial
If you make the arm a little ticcer. It takes longer to break. One of the problems was the arm breaking on  tin side. Ofcourse it means more weight. So more power is needed.  So go aluminium or titanium instead of steel.  Its lighter. Also if you want to go 110% make the slapper the shape of the chicken. Meaning you slap a bigger surface area, meaning better heat transfer
Dink Smallwood does it with 3 slaps
This oddly reminds me of mark robers videos mainly because you used the same background music lol
Now get a human to do it. I volunteer, I am a very proficient slapper. As long as you cover my travel expenses, I'm your man for long, consistent slapping hours.
HE REALLY DID IT!!!
6:07   is that peter stripol? Correct me if I'm wrong
I wanna taste that slap steak.. honestly.
Does this mean one punch man can punch chickens to cook them?
Davie504 approved way to cook a chicken.
why not have a spinning wheel of slappers for hundreds of SPM (slaps per minute)
You should ask Adam Savage to help you make the Meat beater 10K ultra optimized.  Maybe he would love to help making this useless machine even better
Now i know the secret of the Davie504's chicken recipe.
*ONE OF THE BEST YOUTUBE VIDS I'VE EVER WATCHED*
You have to admit... the meat beater 9000 was the still the best name
Aliens will try this on our dead bodies after seeing this. Thanks, Louis...

Proceeds to slap chicken while Mark Rober music background*?
New way to beat ma meat!!??😅
Why didnt you season the meat before you slapped it?????
good idea but all the overreactions made it look stupid sorry mate.
This feels like the kind of content you would see in “I did a thing” channel
Its weird how i got the master class ad on this video. Is youtube trying to tell me something?
Meat beater 😅
10:24 Should've said, "Honestly, this steak slaps."  Missed opportunity there.
So that’s why my mom is so tan
So this is why my girlfriends ass got so cooked
The primary concern I have with this slapping concept is the repeated impact splintering the bones, making the meat rather hazardous to eat without tedious cleaning.   Also a round about way to prove that setting it on fire is the most efficient method of cooking lol.
It's great to see you share music taste with Marc Rober.
@ 69420 slaps he summoned Davie504
2.7M people: well well well let's see then
@Guga Foods
Why haven't I thought of cooking my steaks like this before.
ok. Where’s Davie504?
I could swear that the scale for real science is Kelvin
Disliked on the principle of the metric system being used.  'MURICA.
Davie504 likes this.
I love your channel
It's not even that fast.
When he tasted the steak I was hoping he'd say it slaps
Where is Davie504? I need to see his reaction to this.
A whole new meaning to beating meat
Wasn't Kelvin the standard temperature measurement for science? We were taught that in chemistry, but now I'm confused.
This genuinely needs to go in the history books
So glad this video didn't start with "WHAT'S UP GUYS??"
Amazing vid but change the music or you look like u are trying to be mark rober. I know he's is everyones inspiration but....
Born too late to explore the world  Too early to explore space  But just in time to explore the conversion of kinetic energy into heat energy
Yum
-"What's that sound, honey?" -"Don’t come in, Mom! I'm beating my meat"
He is brave.  He isn't afraid to pound his meat on camera.
Okay, that really cool... But what person slapped those slaps by his own hands to know what happen?
Netflix:Are you still watching? Someone's daughter's bf:ಠ_ಠ
In a few years, we might be able to hear 9:18 in a restaurant kitchen.
You should have just called me instead of making this contraption because I’m a professional meat beater

I saw rice cooker!
They made it, the absolute mad lads, they did it
Lmao I work for hello fresh. I am watching this before going to work! 🤣🤣🤣🤦‍♂️

I could probably cook a chicken with 1 slap using my hand.
That poor animal deserves better than that nasty azz 'rare' garbage.
I just like how techno is in the recommended
Cooks better than my mom
I absolutely hate and adore this at the same time
I have never seen anyone get so excited about food.
For your next experiment you should blast a cup of coffee with sound wave, like screaming on it to heat it up^^
LMAO! You sir have earned 1 slap to the sub button
He sounds like Mr. Beast
Hello fresh is Achually great
Everybody gangsta till the chicken starts walking
You know he's serious about engineering when he starts playing the same music as Mark Rober
Gordon Ramsay wants to know your location
No wonder my girlfriends A** is eatible, ive been slapping it too long
"60 degrees" as it's in Celsius.
*Davie needs to see this.*
this got a meme
The year is 2085; this dude opened a restaurant of slapped meat
okay, but like, the poor chicken-
An ultimate meat beater, finally created
Asian parents : *pathetic*
Who eats with plastic cuttlery! :")
You walked off screen to drain the steak. My bullshit detector is deafening me right now.  You cant walk off screen and then walk back with a cooked steak and expect us to believe you didnt swap it out.
This is the first video I have seen from you, and i procceded to imediatelly subscribe.
I recieved a phone call from the mother in law, she asked what I was up too and apparently beating my meat was the wrong answer.. she hung up in a hurry.
Cooked food such as chicken needs to be cooked to over 75°c otherwise you are risking illnesses, aside from that...good content
You know you could use that as a torture device
Why did he have a mask on while working on it????
Or you can let Vasily Kamotsky slap the chicken
This is one of those videos that's gonna be on our recommended in 7 years.
He's so strong that he sliced a meat with a plastic knife
Thanks for including my favorite YouTube Adam raguesa
Davie504 but chicken
Bruh just call sr pelo
You could say,  you slooped the chicken-
You’re smart but using plastic knife to cut the steak.. not smart lol
Trending
This is alot of trouble just to beat your meat.
Crackhead engineers way ahead of their time. Give it 50 years and this will replace ovens

Davie504's way to cook lmao
I had something else in my mind when I heard meat beater 9000.
But something has already cooked meat with one very big slap: meteorite. You're several hundreds of millions years late.
Sooooo do you like white wine Louis Weisz?

Haven't I seen this somewhere before? *spiral and clock ticking intencifies the haze of another life*

Never did I thought that I would see an updated video on cooking a chicken with slaps

This takes beating your meat to the next level
I've never cooked a chicken by slapping it, but I have been known to choke it.  I wouldn't eat it after choking, but I know a few girls who would.   Thank God for people like Louis, or else imagine how boring the world would be.
I got mark rober vibes from this video
Who else clicked on this because of Unus Annus?
Poor chicken, born to be slapped.
I'm in that weird part of the internet again aren't I?
MrBro: Why didn’t I think of this?
Has to be fake
Well done on your engineering success!!

now the project is to cook the chicken in a single slap
If that chicken only knew what the fate of his body was.... getting slap cooked after death
Hell yeah
After all this time he finally did it this fucking madlad
what if he cooked it and then put it in the bag
what if resturants started slapping food to cook it
First video I watched and this guy sounds like mark rober
Invite Davie 504 for slap😂
Gordon Ramsey: *impossible*
He did it bois
This is cool but also.. Unus annus.. Memento mori
Poor chicken died mysteriously 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
my guy got his first sponsor, good for him!
Next time season it please
They called him a mad man
Is that what crack cocaine does to someone?
Show this to Gordon Ramsay

Somebody needs to show this to Guga Foods. See if he's intrigued by the steak, offended, or absolutely horrified.
Real science is actually done in Kelvin and not degrees C, but baby steps I guess.
Holy shit...I watched the first video... Stahhhhhp!!!!! Omg
This channel seems like silly Mark Rober I love it
7:55 thought that was jack black..... had to rewind a few seconds
These memes are getting outta hand
Only people who studied physics know how important this result is.
where can i get a slapper like the mb9001 mk (3?)
I don’t know why I watched this. But I did. And now I still don’t know why I watched this

So it will took 135,000 strokes if I beat MY meat with full force and got it to 55 degrees celsius. Got it.
Man beats meat, great success. Nice!
I immediately recognized the Blowie-Matron video the moment it showed up xD LTT Fans!!!!

He just said meatbeater 😂😂😂😂😒
Awesome idea man :D

Hey what kind of results would you get slapping your sausage?
What would make this better is if it had subtitles. But the premise of video you can watch without sound (mostly deaf user here) So either way it still includes everyone
Upgrades people, upgrades
4:18 it smells like shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Does that mean I'm cooking my pp?
9:39 He said : "Yooo... wait let me get the real steak and dump this shit in a sec"
I like the mark rober music
So... I may have an idea to make not bad tasting food, if you went back to the wheel slapper, made it so it was slapping upward, to where you have an aluminum pan that stayed still enough you could cook in it, using the slaps to heat the pan, thus still "cooking with the heat of the slaps" just using a pan to better disperse the heat giving a better over all cooking experience and likely a faster cook time as the aluminum pan would heat much faster than the meat its self would.
**stumbles upon channel and looks around** I have found the meaning of life
I can't believe this is a thing. Yo maybe try cooking it in the tumble dryer next time. Just keep the white meats separate from the reds.
Been following this on tiktok and not youtube and then suddenly see the results pop up here, mind blown, this is the peak of science, we're done, pack it up

is it just me or does he reminds me of mark rober

He actually fucking did it
9:21 jebac disa jebac disa jebac disa XDD
I'd pay for that steak. :D However..... I wouldn't touch that chicken. I've always been told that chicken should reach at least 72 degrees to make sure not a single salmonella bacteria makes it through.
I can't keep a straight face with meat beater.
The mad lad did it
Why not build a wheel with “flaps” so it doesn’t have to start and stop with each stroke. You could put multiple flaps to increase efficiency.
this is what happens when intelligent people have  little imagination.

2:35  wait, this start out at 8℃? is that the air temperature??? if it's winter, maybe his job would've been a ton easier doing it in summer or something. an average summer day is 40℃ in my country at least lol  edit: later on he uses snow, so yeah, that's the air temperature inside

Someone please send this to Gordon Ramsay. We officially cooked a steak without kitchen tools less rare than some of Hell's Kitchen contestants.
You may have cooked the meat, but WHERE'S THE LAMB SAUCE
I have 1 percent left pls give me a timesss
Collab with Gordon Ramsay when?
1:06 " the original meat beater''
He is kind of guy, who would scream 9 years to make a hot coffee
the logic he put at 5:00 is baseless. our ultimate goal of cooking is not just to kill bacteria. lets say i give you a chemical that can kill those bacteria and is edible (safe to eat) so would you just apply the chemical and eat the uncooked meat? no, right? then how can you give this logic.  P.S. i am not a hater, i even liked the video. just saying you can't make things up
Why do i feel like Michael Reeves is writing this down
Now make it again with Kelvin instead of Celsius. Otherwise it's not real science.

Was really hoping he was going to use a live chicken this time around...
...You're gonna end up selling a version of this aren't you? People all over the world will be slapping their meat at BBQs. No BBQ will be complete without a bunch of guys slapping their meat. What have you started?
Now contact Gordon Ramsay
Yeah.. my mom still slaps harder
let mark rober give it a go

I love the word pulpification
how did he say “the original meat beater” with a straight face
gordon Ramsay would be proud of you
Ah yes. This is the pinnacle of human innovation.
Season the meat so when the slapper activates,it will beat the seasoning into the Meat
Where's the lamb sauce????
i made my chicken watch this
Meat beater.
Bruh he actually did this on twitch?                                                     Whats the name?
Oh so that's how people used to cook before stoves and ovens.
I would say he had some case of the squirts  after eating that chicken
"THE ORIGINAL MEAT BEATER" what a guy lol
The chicken has no clue of what big change to amounts of people he did.
Gives a whole new meaning to Beating my Meat
r/madlads
Did i just watch a mark rober video
You telling me you spent several hours creating and perfecting a slap machine to cook a chicken but couldn't take 2 minutes to add any seasoning? I'm sorry but I have to say this, white people.
I see Mark Rober 2.0
He did it! This madman did it!
I think you'll cook it better by slapping it with a plastic spatula
finally
*Napoleon Dynamite*
So how fast would a slap have to be to cook a chicken instantly
Why did the chicken cross the road?       *Because he was stuck to the pervert
Someone tag TheRussianBadger right now.
This achievement will go down in history
This man made a slow cooker that beats your food.
Don't want to be a dick but at the end you didn't really do it did you? Why not use more metal parts than wood? In the long term you'd actually make cheaper
Now cook a Bass this way. Slapped Bass

Now this my friends, is quality.
TIL "cooked" means the time point where most bacteria died, no chemical/physical change to the meat needed, except the decaying process due to those bacteria thriving before reaching 60 degrees C.
9:40 walks out the door to replace it by a perfectly cooked steak. Cheap. :D
Mmm yes why use an oven when u have a spare 2-months and a slapping machine
I’ve been waiting so long for this

when you dont have an oven in your house but you do have a really over engineered meat slapper
He should get a noble peace prize for this.
this man needs a welder
The flash could cook the chicken in under 10 seconds.
Finally a better way to beat my chicken.
THE MAD MAN DID IT!!!!
MEAT BEATER
🍖
Celsius for real science? not like Kelvin?
Why do people think that °C is “more scientific” than °F? Both are perfectly adequate for describing temperature. There is no inherent advantage in using the Celsius scale over the Fahrenheit scale, and Americans are more accustomed to Fahrenheit. You probably have mostly Americans watching this video. The whole attitude of “We must prefer whatever units are preferred outside the United States” frankly sucks! And the SI standard for temperature is Kelvin, not Celsius.
I didn't know AVE had a son ;)
"meat beater" heh
Holy shit season 2 finally came out!
slap colab with Davie504
11:55 jebać disa
9:21 you know what means that text on chat ? XD Polaczki kochają pana Norberta xd
I was interested in your vid untill you started ising celcius. F__k metric
Gordan Ramsay watching this:  🍞 👄🍞
What if you beat it from two sides? Like double beating power with same force and energy
davie504  likes this video.
135k slaps on the likebutton what a coincedence :3
"Beating the meat"
Chicken thats it,that's the comment
lot of ads the hell u poor?
He taking some notes from Rober I see... smart.
9:21 omg that chat xD
i'm sure you don't need this, but i'm damn proud of you LOL
Walmart Mark Rober
someone in the chat said about the steak “medium slapped”
You shouldn’t have taken the steak in the backroom. Though I actually believe the steak is legit it loses credibility
Me at the restaurant: "Excuse me, my meal is undercooked"  Waiter: "Just a second, Sir"  *Starts slapping the food*
Next time you've got to slap it by hand
''I cooked a chicken by slapping it''  [REDACTED] channel wants to know your location.
Time to beat some meat.
somebody watches a lot of mark rober
OH MY GOD ITS THE INFINITE MONKEY THEOREM OMG ITS HAPPENING ITS REALLY HAPPENING
Now I don’t need to buy an oven
Is someone going to tell him he did not cook a chicken or a stake and that he should never apply for a job as a cook anywhere
I really want gordon ramsay to see this
Stop using farenheit bs only usa use that and probably 90% of your followers are outside of the murica
youre a legend
69420
Dont copy Mark Rober....be you..💯you know what i mean.....
I know this was to specifically test the slap theory, but have you considered trying the same thing by shaking it instead? Probably easier with less impact forces to deal with.
Someone tell Markiplier and Crankgameplays this man was able to do it.
You absolute madman you really did it.
I'm so immature,  when he said "the original meat beater" I laughed. 😜😛😋😝🤪
BS. Bring the steak out the bag without editing. BS. BS. 🐮 💩
The title: I cooked a chicken by slapping it. 2.3 million people: “interesting”
Too complicated slapper, not the best design.
Imagine early humans cooked chicken like this and not by roasting them.. dump or smart?
Anyone else just loved the music while he was showing the slapping part.
>SALMON<-ELLA
good. now do it with your hands
I started slapping myself
How very efficient.
sad you couldn't eat the chicken
"Jebać disa" xD
I subscribed because of this video
There is an obvious upgrade here. Use a combustion engine obviously
Poor chicken
this is a masterpiece.
Ok, music control: what is the intro (from 0:00 to 0:37) song's name? Also, has anyone informed Davie504? So much slapping and he wasn't involved?
To think yusef  was here watching this temilad
i feel like the suve bath is cheating a little, because using it in conjunction with the slapper only proves what we already knew: the slapper can add 20 degrees c over a standard amount of time before always failing. all we really proved is that its really hard to build a machine that slaps food hot X,D but it was still entertaining
This result is absolutely on the "15 minutes of useless information" list
Daaamn, are those the mars yard 2.5?
very pog
Slappp da chickon
Gordon Ramsey 👁👄👁
Just as I was about to eat vol-au-vent.
You should always slap your chicken  to 70c core temperature.
...    he beat his meat
I love science
What
Does my man just casually have Mars yards on? 😂😂😂
This is not settled till you eat the cooked chicken
Rooster: my child, you are destined to do great things.  Chicken:
Waiter: "Sir, how do you want your steak?"      Me, an intellectual: *Slapped!*
Why before you show if it's cooked, do you leave the room and then show it? 🤔 I think it's kind of doubtful
Finally, now i know that 135000 slaps is the optimal slappage needed for cooked meat
that song that mark rober always uses while discussing the design
I’m just proud that you actually finally did it. I feel like a proud parent haha
Girls in the gym locker room: "Omg do you think luke is cheating on me?!?"  Boy in the gym locker room: "It's time to slap some meat"
This is just legit mark rober
The edit, delivery and background music , I thought I was watching a Mark Rober video.  YouTube Ai suggestions isnfrwaky.
@therussianbadger we have the answer
Disclaimer: no chickens were harmed in making of this video
I see your mark rober music
Atleast your mom didnt walk in on you
WOW...MARK ROBER 2.0
Mans could’ve just made a redstone clock powering a piston.. what a not very good crafter of the mines
But how many chokes does it take. I challenge you to.........
Wow, beating meat can be an actual paying job.
Teenage boys when they hit puberty:
This is crazy.
9:30 enjoy <3
Do a steak next
Dude you’re really onto something here. No joke.
As I'll say again, "If kinetic energy turns into thermal energy, how hard do I have to punch a chicken to cook it?" - Some friend of a Russian dude
6:09 Peter?
slappy bird
👍👍👍👍👍
We finally did it bois!!!
i think that thumbnail might have been click-bait....
i feel like you could have seasoned the chicken because its in a "bag" now so you don't have to worry about the splash
So, I just spent the last 13 minutes watching a guy use engineering to beat his meat...
-Ehh why....Why are you slapping a chicken with a hammer Uhhh Nothing.. im just cooking it -W h a t
oh yesss i was waiting for this
Russianbadger anyone?
The temperature for real science is not Celsius, it's Kelvins! :)
new video idea: chicken cooks human by slapping it
Lockdowns result in very mysterious behavior...
Me at 3am
He really likes beating that meat!!
Fahrenheit is actually more accurate than celsius
No one. Me at 3am
Hey it’s Peter! Love flight test
oh my god, the joke here. oh no.
Not only did he cook that steak, but he tenderized the living shit out of it in the process. A 1:1 temperature to tenderness ratio. Amazing.
ถ้ามึงเลือกใช้มอเตอร์ความเร็วต่ำ มันจะง่ายกว่านี้ นี่มึงเน้นรอบสูง เปิดแมร่งนาน เอาแต่ความเร็ว มันก็พังดิ

So anticlimactic.

When beating the meat goes on a whole new level:
He actually did it????
The power of german engineering
Im sure you will cook another experiment soon!
Mark Rober is typing....
Plz do a colab with guga foods to add a nice crust
the music in this vid is so distracting you are not mark rohber
I have figured out the uoutube algorithm. Any video with the music that's at 0:57 goes trending.
starts using the same music as mark rober
Prometheus: "Am I a joke to you?"
Don't mind me, it's 3AM here when I was watching this.
how many of you have dirty thoughts about it?  eg.the butt slap machine😂
At 0:57 I thought I was watching a Mark Rober video.
Michel Reeves is probably screeching in his basement after seeing this
so brave and stunning!
Mark rober vibes
You had me at meat beater 9000
Gordon ramsay needs to see this
And there were two chicken ads before the vid
Go to sleep, it's 5 AM
is that the same song mark rober uses  edit: it is
is that the same song mark rober uses  edit: it is
Guy you know he grabbed a cooked steak from the bathroom, do buy his bs!
Beat the meat
Could somebody Tell Russianbadger that a meme has become reality?
At this point i watch literly everything
I see those Mars yards 👌
It looks like fake
I think u could've just cooked it on the motor lmao
When you beat your meat for the 69,420th time. YEAHHHH NEW RED COLOR UNLOCKED BABY LETS GOOOO
Dis guy: my goals are beyond your understanding
I love this
WE DID IT!
For the love of god, get out of my recommended
I wonder how a vegan would view this video?
Unus Annus, UNUS ANNUS
I'm a subscribe! :D **sees 'Subscribe to Pewdiepie'** oh, Unsubscribed! :D
They called him a Madman.
explain, how is the steak cooked from every side perfectly?
Engineers are... Weird
I got a kfc ad before watching this
**inhales** MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA
RIP to all the chickens that gave their life for science.
Bro...Why didn't you season it?
Now I would make a joke about... you know... "me at 3am" type things, but this is so amazing I've decided not to...    BEAT THAT MEAT!!!! (Sorry I couldn't resist)
*I don’t need sleep, I need answer*
Mark Rober: Wish Edition
Why would my mind read "I choked my chicken by slapping it?"
12 free meals damn thats a good deal ngl.
Wannabe Mark Rober.
A new delicacy
How my pp not burn then?
Who needs Mcgyver when we have Louis Weisz? 😁
I mean yeah but like no? That chicken still looked raw as hell 😂 but this update was glorious
i dont need sleep, I need answers
Just... Wow.
This is peak humanity
I never thought I'd live to see the day...  Also chicken is cooked to 165 to eliminate the possibility of also contracting trichinosis, tiny clicified parasites that bury themselves in muscle. I don't think they do much other than make you sore as hell for about a month and make your flesh inedible, so you get the last laugh if something eats you without cooking you properly. Messed up thought but kinda funny.
The use of Mark Rober music makes this even better than it is already XD
Guys RIP for my man he beat his meat so hard he accidently cooked it 👨‍💻
This takes "Beat the Meat" to a whole new level
"hey grandpa, what did you do for fun as a kid?"  "I built machines that slapped chickens until they cooked"
0:57 why do I hear Boss Music?
Me: oh he’s cooking a chicken. Louis: BEAT IT BEAT IT NOW
*Mark Rober music intensifies*
meat beater 9000😭😭😭
intro gives me mark rober vibes
He just had to leave the room at 9:39!, not saying its faked but now i doubt :( was loving it up until then
Don't use mark robers music.  Way lame
I have a feeling the vegan teacher will make a video about this
Pre-chewed steak. Perfect.
Some rich guy would pay for this
I think you could have made holes in the slapper since less surface area means less air drag/resistance so less air blew into the chicken, also it would be easier to operate since with less air drag there would be less air weight needed to push.
9:21 Polacy zobaczcie
This slaps more than Davie504.
Nice Mars Yard
To be honest, I only clicked cause of the title
he beat his meat. rejoice.
for half of the video, i dont really understand what he says. But hey, we got the steak cooked :D
Please don’t use Gods name in vain bro, Repent. God bless you and your family
Davie504 likes this
0:44 lmao hydraulic press channel
What if you made some machine that turns to be much more efficient than the slapper, let’s say a machine that “slaps” the food much more faster but with much less movement, let’s say something based in ultrasonic stuff
1:00 he knew what he was doing when he named it _meat beater_ Good show mate, good show
So....any chance you might contact guiness world records for this xD
Come on.  Harden the rig and let’s see how far you can take it!   Sure it’s “cooked”. But I’d love to see if you can burn the food via slaps.
I’m getting memories
Davie504 would be very very happy
You cooked the chicken! Hurray! And it took 135k slaps. So how many slaps does it take to completely make it an edible chicken? 😂
POINTLESS.
Marshall would be proud
Gorden ramsey would be proud
Someone send this to Davie
I just found a new mark robber
Mark rober vibes
But was he going to season the chicken ever or...?
So you’re telling me we need 135k ppl in a line to slap one chicken ant it’ll be cooked 🧐
Today on weird things the algorithm suggested...
“Meat better”

And to think they said my generation would never do anything monumental.
Honestly.......😂😂😂
Aí cachorro faz um vídeo chacoalhando água até ferver agora, vai ser estouro.
Actually, slapping a carcass is kinda morbid.
LIAR
So if I slap my self like 1 billion times, I'll be hot?
Wow
Truly this is why science exists
This is when you call on Flash and Quicksilver to gang bang that chicken!
*SOMEONE GET GROUSE AND RUSSIANBADGER LINKED AND KNOWN TO THIS VIDEO*

2 months. 400,000 Subs. All for a fucking Meat Slapper. I hate you. lmao!
Did anyone else watch this video while thinking of Badger’s video talking about this
Meatbeater...this word says somethin...
Unus Annus Unus Annus
So the meme is truth. NEXT: "I screamed so hard i created a black hole!"
Where is the Russianbadger. I better see him react to this bc this came up in one of his videos
“I can’t believe i’m eating something that came out of a slapper” 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤣
Boi
Damn this slaps !
When you going to make a restaurant
They say it couldn't be done but now
" The next Mark Rober is here".     Edit: wow I have never gotten this many likes before! Thank you!!!
I'm pretty certain he swaped the stake when he went to the kitchen.  Anyway, the videos and the inventions were fun af.
latino facebook moms: *pathetic*
What
*Davie504 wants to know your location*
Can you slap eggs???
9:21 i ten czat 😂
REAL SCIENCE  woo hoo!!!
So when can we order one of those ?
This is the future I was hoping for
local teen tortures a chicken using kinetic energy and maniacally eats it's half cooled flesh
I have a feeling that Mark Rober would love this.
just sent this to my physics teacher
*Next time: How many slaps does it take to cook an egg?*
Cloudy with a chance of meat slaps
DaT AsS THouGh
All the militant vegans dislikes and raging in the comments how this is somehow "animal abuse". lol
The kid builds junk out of what he can find at home depot and then makes fun of Hydraulic Press Channel for their input. Nice try.
What if u smack someones face for 6 hours would that cook his face😂
Jebać dissa na czacie xDF
This is like a mark rober vid
Um..is that even chicken?
He's like a knock-off Mark Rober. Lol 😆
Could this be used to slap...ummm... other things perhaps a human ??
Me beats meat with hand. Louis 'the meat beater 9001'
Me not understanding anything he says in the video but cooked chicken YEAH!
I dont know how to cook gourmet but I know how to beat my meat. So I will beat my meat into dinner.
“Meat beater”
congrats on finishing this thing :)
So how much power and force to cook it in one slap?
This would make Mark and Ethan proud
This... This changes everything...
Davie 504 approves !
man tryna be like hacksmith
That chicken got injured real bad
This would make [DELETED CHANNEL] proud :)
You're a bloody legend
Where are the comments saying "fake"
Technology *exists* this guy "LETS COOK A CHICKEN*
Congratulations !!! XD
you just know this is gona be in the end credits of the world
I love that he’s wearing mars yards they must be worn to death
I have no clue why yt would recommend me a meat slaper
What you have for dinner last night oh I had slapped steak
this slaps
Ah yes, jebać disa specjalnie w momencie 60 stopni. Jesteś bohaterem mojego dnia ktokolwiek to napisał
Louis: Surprised the meat is soft the literal automatic meat tenderizer that has been running for hours:    :0
There's no seasoning on that meat
9:22 Greetings from Poland XDDDD and polish Twitch.
i slap meat but it doesn’t warm up xD
Vegan's Nightmare
George Forman grill slappers try that
there is something wrong naming it 'meat beater' and i dont wanna say it
The idea is ridiculous but the science behind it is epic in scope 💪

thx for the idea i can cook my ex g now from slapping

This guy pulling out the mark rober music
Don’t share this to that vegan teacher  *or she make a hate video on u*
This guy: Slaps to cook his chicken! Davie504: Finally a worthy opponent!!!
Hey son what would you like to eat?  What about some steak?  And then you just wait for like 5 hrs and u get this beat up steak
Science
wtf
The slapper should say: MUDAHMUDAHMUDAHMUDAHMUDAH
I hate the fact he says just C instead of Celsius, yet he says Fahrenheit and not just F
Clickbait! Big difference between Steak vs Chicken. You can't eat medium-rare chicken!
Aperture Science presents...
Does anyone remember or know when Unnus Annus DEFINITELY cooked a chicken SUCCESSFULLY with slaps. It wasn't just two guys slapping chicken for a funny video. NOT AT ALL.
And not a single "Beat my meat" joke.  This man has the will of a god.
Someone needs to put this on pewdiepies subreddit
When the same music that Mark Rober uses in his videos dropped, even his ''speech way'' got similar... wtf
Chief approves
Interesting.
Gordon Ramsey would never.
I.....  I'm glad youtube recommended this video.  I think?
He later died of food poisoning.
Finally i have been waiting for this ☺️😅
imagine beeing vegan
This takes “beat the meat” to a whole new level
Woooooo you slapping meat that hard to cook and eat it something smells fishy and its not the turkey
*What’s up, slappers*
Would love to see a collab with you and Stuff Made Here on how to build a Meat Beater 10,000

5 pm, i opene my pc to do my homework........ it is 2am
I would love to use this on my GF 🍑
Them Battlebots boys don't want no smoke with this dude
The cooking oil joke was funny man
This video is literally the meme *Modern problems require modern solution*
that's not a bad idea bro you just need to put some butter and seasoning in with it and I bet it would be fired for real man and like try doing barbecue sauce with the chicken I bet that would be good. Slap BBQ chicken so good make you want to slap your mama.
Kelvin, not celsius is the scale for real science.
Meat beater 2000
Omg that's peter airplane guy.
9:21 Bruh, Poland
So that's what everyone means when talking about "beating the meat"
That steak is "Rare" not "perfect medium Rare".
I-...... this is amazing!
Next up... Time machine
9:21 Poles on the chat be like
He sure did beat his meat
I thought they've invited Howtobasic to slap the chicken
This guy took beating meat to another level.    That was a bad joke, I'm sorry
If I feel cold, may I suggest someone to slap me?
I really wanted him to say “this steak slaps”
The caveman must have had use this slapping technique to cook there chicken.
Improvise, Adapt, Overcome.
Nasty
This could be a torture tool
Pog
Meat beater sound sus 🤣🔥
69420  Nice
I feel like this is a decent idea for steak.  par slapping to tenderize then pan fry to finish
The second installment of the saga that we've all been waiting for.
Please season that chicken
are we just gonna ignore that he said “meat beater”
This is my kind of engineering
But... But that was a steak, not a chicken.
*happy Davie504 noises*
God
just a guy beating his meat
Mark Rober V2
Finally! An effective use for Aerogel!
“You were so busy asking if you could, you never stopped to think of you should.”
Davie504 would've appreciate this
I watched the whole video to see a man eat a slapped chicken. Not slapped steak or, slapped HAM! Lol. I'm sad now
He slapped a soul into that bad boy
Senku before managing to start a fire when he got hungry could utilize this idea.
The guy is literally beating his meat
A chicken died twice
The question now is how hard must be just ONE slap to cook that chicken.
the music made me think i was watching Mark Rober for a sec
This is fake. It jump cut when he left the room with the chicken.
meat beater-
Chicken spanking machine 2.0
Louis to the chicken: ✋🍗
?
Welp, that thumbnail fooled me. Thought it was gonna actually look like that.
He really loves beating his meet
damn that chicken got pounded
Now he's taking Mark Robert background music 😢 lmfao. This video is amazing.
So... your rig is ok in that it works*, which is obviously the most difficult part, but now you need to refine your rig so that it works _well_. Your biggest issue, right now, seems like stability - specifically, you need to limit your side-to-side movement... so that means you'd basically need a robust, as-low-as-possible-friction gate at the front of the slapper so that it's side-to-side movement is restricted. In theory, the longer your gate is (in relation to the length of the slapper arm), the more stable your slapper will be.
You mad lad you actually did what Mark and Ethan tried
"The Original Meat Beater" Yesss...
Oh, boy there we go ,this is gonna blow up
What???? Does medium rare chicken edible?
Slapping his way to success.
This should be in every survival guide, if you can't start a fire just slap your meat until it's cooked
*Gordon Ramsay would like to know your location
reminds me of unus annus :')
Okay that's a cool one .
LPG is for amateurs
My guess: he lyin
The chicken started with 27°C wtf?
“Celsius is for real science” well yea, despite the fact zero Celsius using country has ever contributed even 10% combined to science as the one single country that doesn’t use it. Seems like real science uses imperial when they lead the world in science.
um uhhhh ok subbed
So fake
World changing
What do you call the first person to beat their meat?  1:05
Majority of the people in the live chat are all about " BEAT THAT MEAT"
Please where do I buy this
I suppose this is a Davie504 approved method
Why not instant of using a extra arm to bit the chiken use a fan design  directly Conneted to the Motor.
Neat
Lol i see the first video a coupel days ago
We’re just gonna ignore how he called it the meat beater 💀
Fucking Legend
Now,this is SCIENCE
He is the future hacksmith 😂
9:21 oni są wszędzie
You could have put a spring at the end of the hammer to convert some of the potential energy back in to kinetic. This would also have relieved stress of the motor.
Make a meat slapping restaurant
do an egg
You DID not cook it by slapping it 😡
This can bring new meaning to Slapsgiving.
When he promote the sponsor I was like "There you go dude. You deserve it. Hella work"
Slap like now...
Beating meat to the next level
And he took that personally
The meat beater
The autism levels in that chat were intense. It's like if your cousin that was super into memes and minecraft decided to start cooking and stream it. Was a fun watch though.
It slaps
He's beating meat on cam, YouTube take this down
Damn that's a hot chicken
Taking beating the meat to a new level
Mark Rober do this
It has finally been done
HelloFresh chicken stinks like it's gone off when you get it, then actually goes off within a day or two. They even put a note with orders now to tell you not to worry about the smell, but nobody else's chicken smells like that, and it tastes bad too. HelloFresh chicken sucks.
The meat beater 9000 featuring my arm and hand
Why does this guy only have 300k subs
Patient and persistence will get you where you need to be 👌🏼
Try to slap shit and eat.
Yeah science!
"69,420" *I love it.*
How does it feel, being the only person eating a steak cooked by slapping ever?
The original meat beater had a problem
I'm glad I got to see a PT 2
9:30 auto caps
This video is a perfect example of the internet wasting your time.
Unus Annus
a historical moment in the scientific community
Girls in puberty: ARGH I HATE EVERYTHING  Boys during puberty:
Dude singlehandedly destroyed the oven market
1969: went to the moon 1990s: Internet made information more accessible than ever 2021: slap slap chimken
The fact you never gave up on chicken slapping is super inspirational. It kind of takes away any excuse i could give for anything in the future.
I mean, why not
Ffs its kelvin for "REAL SCIENCE"
Imagine just cooking a chicken in the oven....no that's crazy talk
He is looking like jake poul with a brian
Father: Son why do you want to become an engineer?  Son: to invent machines to make life easier   And him:
1:04  noise!
Give it a couple years... this will become an extremely fancy way of cooking. $300 slap steaks.
Don’t take mark robers music. Apart from that it’s epic
meat beater lmao
Yo bro you said chicken
The People if we didn’t know the Oven etc.
I like my chicken the way I like my women.
The next mark rober huh?
you sound like danny pudi
Could the same effect be archived by using a paint shaker machine? Effectively slapping the chicken from 2 directions :D
Imagine ramsay saying: EVEN A FREAKING SLAPPING MACHINE MADE BY A LAZY GUY MADE A BETTER MEDIUM RARE THAN THAT!!!!            (what a madlad....respect towards you)
Interesting
*EPIC SCIENTIST MOMENT*
The real chicken was the friends we cooked along the way
Louis beats his meat all day everyday 😂😂😂🤣🤣.
I think the spirit of the question is how hard would you have to spank a chicken ONE time to cook it but close nuff :D
Perseverance rover: I wonder if they are putting my info to good use

That poor chicken corpse  Got slapped till cooked
Oh god I just learned it’s called a *Meat Beater*
Return of the king
I watch some random stuff on here.
*Mark Rober is typing*
Hehe. Meat beater.
imagine vegans watching this
I need one of these.
Any1 mind explaining how slapping a chicken produces heat?
"If physical energy be turned to thermal energy. How hard would I have to punch a chicken? In order to eat it?" -Grouse in a Russian badger vid.
But the real question did he season any of the meat?
just imagine if this got the proper funding
Gotta abandon the mark rober music, your shits good, def want to keep it more original to you
Memento mori, friends. Our boys would be proud
For real science you have to use Kelvin, where -273,15 K equals 0 degrees Celsius
Yumm nothing like slapped steak 👌
I refuse to believe this is real 😂🤣
No seasoning? Failed!
Not gonna lie but I really do think cooking a chicken in the oven is easier. Lol maybe it’s just me?
I only see rn ,,Jebać Disa" XD  Hello Poland xD 11:55
If you're in Denver let me know cause we could make some crazy inventions. I do commercial HVAC systems and it would be fun!
After watching this,i hope you all install chicken slapper in your homes to cook chicken.
Open a restaurant now called "meat beaters" and sell cooked steak by beating meat😉
"The original meatbeater had a fundamental problem"
Cooking also helps food be more digestible by loosening fibers softening fats and reticulating splines. etc.
"How would you like your meat done?" *"Slapped."*
2 million + views smh I was baffled then I thought to myself dumb people outweigh the intelligence people by a landslide
"Cooked a chicken" (made steak)
Fake!
We witnessed history here ladies and gentleman
This is completely pointless and inefficient, yet I’m still glad it exists.
I would have started by contacting Russian slap champions. If you haven't watched these men slap the living shizz out of one another, please do. They would definitely know about slap depth!
I remember i saw this on 9gag, years ago, like theoricaly(?)
I wonder what I looked at for YouTube to recommend me this. Nevertheless I did watch the entirety of this slapping chicken adventure.
There’s gotta be something more useful
You know it’s good when they use words you don’t know
In my opinion this is stupid video
The view of the future in 1985: flying cars, hoverboards, mini nuclear fusion reactors.  The future: Chick SLAP

For those of you who think the U.S is weird for not converting to the metric system, I, as an American, don’t know why the U.S. won’t convert either
this is peak science
What Philistines disliked this video?
Why is the intonation and cadence of your speech exactly like Adam Neely's lol. Actually now that i think about it, a lot of male Youtubers have this very specific intonation?? A potential line for linguistic inquiry
11:19 Live action Syndrome, but 100x more benign
I just watched a man beat his meat for 13 minutes and 16 seconds
Alright Youtube, you win this one... I clicked on it.
Imagine restourant saying SLAPPED CHICKEN
"It smells like steak!" Well, I should hope so! haha 😄
you are a budget mark rober. good job.
next time try this experiment on yourself and see you cooked or not
"I'm just saying, if physical energy can be turned into thermal energy, how hard would I have to punch a chicken to cook it?"
#gordonramsayreacts
This gives a whole new meaning to beating your meat
Poor chicken
Expectations: iron man suit  ' nano tec ' arc reactor Reality: half cooked food from slaps
Should have called Davie504 to slap that chicken
This guy never stops hes never defeated 😂😂
Mark Rober Music😂
Just the name 'meat beater' alone makes this video worth it!  Also the fact that you had to lose a LOT of heat to cook a chicken without heating it with heat transmission...
Nice meat beater 😂
This takes beating your meat to a new level
Wow, what a nice sequel
Davie 504 would be proud
1:55 *D E M O N E T I S E D*
I'm a medium well to well done guy myself. Tried medium once, never again.
This is him,  the legendary upstairs neighbour
Next step: Can you cook a Chicken by punching it hard enough with sheer kinetic energy
Can't wait to use this to slap some pus-...
Anyone hear the mark rober music?
This guy is like mark rober same music to
Didnt even eat the chicken smh
3:30 the only part that matters
If somebody makes a book about beating your meat...      I will be dammed if this man isn’t first place
someone: oh what are u up to? Louis: just beating my meat
Every mad scientist needs an IR camera for predictive failure analysis.
Do a collab with Mark Rober 💖
FINALLY!
Theres no way I'm the only person here that clicked on this video becouse it reminded them of unas Annas
Fun fact: u learned more here science lessons than online class
If you ever slap and eat steak again, you should marinate the meat before slapping. 👀👀👀
It's weird to think that this dude is really trying to copy Mark Rober...
Meat Beater 9000, ahh so you've heard of me
Sean Connery maintained it only took one good slap to get a chicken cooked
Did you get this from a Russian Badger video? if so, n i c e
Quarantine making this guy solve real world problems
As a non technishion I might talk bs... With your mashine you "hit" the meat, if you would "slap" it, I think that could help.
This man didn’t give up, and he didn’t fail   One for the history books!
I hope he tries again and eat it
Imagine getting killed just to get slapped many times in a video lmao
Someone needs to send this to Grizzy
Oven companies: *nervous screaming*
does water heat up more efficiently from slaps? if so you could boil many foods :)
This is way too important to not watch.
What a dedication
If mark rober and the hacksmith had a kid
* Davie504 enters chat  B A S S
The fact that he called it a "meatbeater" scares me.
Gordon Ramsay should see this.
One hell of a tenderizer
That must be the worst possible way to cook chicken🤣
Me remembering the video from the channel that must not be named
Not eating fiberglass? Cringe
You reminded me of Dr.stone
*slap*

Hello! When i watch this Video it has 2Mio views.
Let’s flu king goooooo brooo
Asian moms when their kid doesn't get a A+
I thought this video has to be clickbait i am very surprised now 😂
Question, why you took the steak with you to the other room instead to just bring something to pour the liquid and not make us think there was fool play?
Meat beater👀👀🤣
You need to be carefull on motor cooling because overcooling it will make the metal contract making the (in this case) magnets and copper wirering grind and thereby damaging and lowering motor performance.
The more I see that person, the more I realize that he actually looks like Charlie Chaplin.
shoutouts to blowiematron
seems like a very slap-dash design.

Whats the song playing in the background called at 1:16
Imagine this one chicken living its whole life just to have its corpse slapped 69420 times.
Under investigation. 💯
it has to be the chicken, stake is cheating, you know what you have to do.
OMG it will change the world
Music from mark rober
Gordon ramsay: the chicken is dry you donut
Every to cook chicken and steak lol
Aah i always wondered why my girlfriend's a*s tasted like cooked meat !
FUCKIN SUBBED! THIS MAN IS ASKIN THE REAL QUESTIONS AND FINDING THE REAL ANSWERS!
I was waiting for this day
1:04 meat beater!? Where can I buy one
I'v been cooking sausage every morning for years.
"A moment of silence for the pain that poor chicken has taken"                                🐔➡️🍗
Wtf am I watching!?
You could have cooked it on the motor or the variac too.
i remember watching this on my lunch break a couple months ago. this is peak wholesomeness and we are so proud
I honestly saw this and thought of TheRussianBadgers kfc video
I hope they show this in schools
So it is basically a meat beater
Imagine being this guy's neighbor, the noise has to be horrible
So, if someone slaps me constantly.. would i get cooked?!!
The more "sensible" Michelle Reeves
Muda Muda muda
*Plays one second of copywrited music* Youtube: 😠💢 Man literally beating his meat for 23 mins straight  Youtube: #23 on trending ❤️
I watch this and wonder at the same time...what in the world am i watching right now🤣🤣🤣.... weird thing is...i watch this till the end like...tf am i doing🤣🤣🤣
Like your stuff, do think you should at least chose a diff song than mark rober song
Davie508 wya
I'm still in doubt since my mom has produced millions of degrees of heat from just once slap, to my face
Coming for Mark Rober huh
Nobody:  Food Industry: "Well, this is cooked - technically"
I wonder what else the MEATBEATER works on 👀
Next time use friction insted much faster
This isn’t science it’s cooking, so god broke the rig as punishment for stupidity of using C
Me wondering: how many slap does it take to cook a chicken My sleep paralysis demon: 135,000 slap Me: thanks
You did it, man!!! Round of applause 👏👏
Just put that damn poor chiken in the oven dude 😭
everything and i mean everything feels like a mark rober video
Sasha Grey got cooked by the same machine lol
Did you really beat your meat on stream
If you wanted variable speed then why didn’t you use a gear box
this dude is mad
How to BBQ chicken without pollution
Gtf lmfao bullshit😂😂😂😂
60oc is not cooked. You need 78 to be save
So everyone gonna forget about what he called it at 1:03
I’d say vegans are even proud of this 😂
That's one small slap for man  One hard whack for mankind
Netflix: Are you still watching? Someone's daughter: 1:56
How can we cook a chicken by making it colder?
I like how you copied mark robber music
¿Can we use your invention to slap the virus away? 😔
Imagine if that machine beats your dong
They called him a mad man
I will never eat steak that's not cooked fully through. I don't want to see red in any parts of the meat. (I love beef and steak, but seeing red on there is a hazard)
beating the meat
This is what youtube was made for. Thank you.
off brand mark rober
Budget Mark Rober
“This is the meat beater 9000”
Now noone will use oven anymore
aaaand... the slapcook 2000 is back!!!!
This is a great achievement for humanity 👏👌👍🙌
" MEAT BEATER "    Every guy is a meat beater
Imagine getting your hand under that
when do you open a restaurant
I'm so proud of you dude.
Slap of a thousand exploding suns.
u need to make a slapper heater
Gordon Ramsay would like to know ur location.
I've seen it done way before this tho bro but still cool
science at its finast humor
We went from a joke into this. I'm proud of this community
Taking "beating your meat" to a whole new level
How would you like your steak done sir? "Slapped please"
Jello indeed was right that we can just slap chickens.
Dat Mark Rober video clone doh
That meal slaps...  I'll let myself out.  *Diminishing echoed footsteps*
I've got one word for you ... "Noice"
that was the most yt chicken i've ever seen. ong
yes
Those Banh Mi Bowls are my absolute favorite dinner, and super easy to make.
Davie504: *WEAK*
YOU DID IT????? why tho?
Building this thing but eating with a plastic knife and fork - why? :D Nontheless - congratz!
How
Get yourself a job
The meat beater
Invite Gordon Ramsay over. I doubt he's never had food cooked by slap power before!
I really watched this guy beat his meat for 13 minutes😂
Wow I never thought I’d like watching someone beating they’re meat
MARK ROBER WHAT WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT
Restaurant with this as the chef
Slap slap slappity slap and your chicken is flat.
*they called me a madman*
Season it
you can hear @Davie504 running towards the video
Thats gonna be a tender steak.  You just needed to pan fry the outside at the end to get a nice browned outside. slapped to perfection!
The people that told you that celsius was the temperature for real science were lying to you, it's actually Kelvin, so unfortunately this can't be considered real science, maybe next time
I just lost several Things I.Q. points after watching this.
This is like the opposite of sous vide. Instead of a relaxing bath, SLAPS!
Davie504 has entered the chat 👀.
Chicken slapper 3000
next u gotta season it and serve it
Meat beater 9000 😂😂😂
I cooked chicken by slapping it       *w-what?*
I’ve heard this song from Mark Rober and I really want to know what the song is called. Please someone?
Meat beater 9000
No garlic No ginger No salt...  Yeah it wont smell good at all.... Edit:  and it is gonna taste blend
The existence of YouTube has been justified..
9:21 <3
Ok now make mashed potatoes with it
Mr bro did this
Best spanking device EVER 😂😂😂
Mark Rober music in the background makes everything sound smarter
you are the only man that can say “a chicken broke my slapper”
this should be a thesis
Me: But mom, I want colinfurze!  Mom: We already have colinfurze at home!  colinfurze at home:
F
And this is where youtube put me today.  Gotta say, I'm happy about it.
Anyone else notice the Pewdiepie at 6:40
Time traveler1: so this is when they invited hit heat  Time traveler2: no no this just a random youtuber  Time traveler1: does he realise what he is doin-  Time traveler3:omg just shut up
couldn’t u just use an oven
me when im 10 years old studying a test with my mom my mom:
Why does this video feel so much like Mark Rober’s.
This is exactly who should be wearing the Mars Yards👏👏👏👏👏
"the original meat beater"
We say it degree celsius not just C.
Dangers of excessive maaturbation
the debate is settled
I'm new. No disrespect but you sound like mark rober and the music too.
Lol
How to make your life more harder
I'm glad you succeeded . But I gotta tell you , you need to "Get A Life" . I mean who is really gonna use this process in real life ? I'm not trying to be mean but I just think that this experiment was a total waste of time .
How many chickens did it take 🤔
My mom cooks me everyday
this series has been a journey lol
Why did he not put any spices/season in the bag with the meat 😭
This guy is a lier Mr bro cooked a chicken with he's hands slapping it over 3 months ago
So much time....so much effort....just to eat slapped meat
this dude have mr beast voice
7:16, '42069'? Did you skip it? :(
He beats his meat a lot
this is exactly what i wanted to see in my recommended
Davie504 approved it!
Kyle Hill would love this.
People in 1980s: “By 2020 we will have flying cars”  People in 2021:
I know you switched that steak.
Gordon Ramsay would like to know your location
Hello fresh is fucking criminal they keep sending disgusting dog shit if you don’t log on and change the order to something edible
Cook a chicken with a single slap
All jokes aside I dont think people understand how amazing this is
Imagine going to a restuarant and the waiter tells you "Your chicken will be ready after 135k slaps."
The chicken slappers, the superior race is coming.
This is ... Meat Beater 9001 requiem 8:19
He is really good at redstone
This gives a whole new meaning to Slapsgivings
Now this. This is why humanity evolved out of apes. Yet so many of us are still lacking behind
You’re probably #1 in the world right now in the "slapping a Chicken until it’s cooked" Speedrun Category
Even the same music it has to be mark
😷😷
Quality content, I can tell even before I start watching.
His mother’s friends come over for a drink and asks what’s that noise coming from the garage. His mother replies it’s just my son smacking his meat.
If multiple slappers would be used the title of the video would be something like "Chicken gang banged by slapping people"
Is this mark robers brother
This is "How To Make Life More Difficult"
60 degrees Celsius is too low in my opinion
heat up coffee by "yelling at it" next? (blasting it with sound)
wow you can actually say that you sat around all day beating your meat.
mark rober vibes
Wow
Sounds like Mark Rober if I do say so myself
I lived to see this happen. I am proud of you.
Have you tried verbally assaulting the chicken first? For example, criticizing the chickens political views, or perhaps comparing it to the much superior turkey. Then, once it’s self esteem is shattered, initiate the slaps.
Ah yes, the Cclapper
It’s still raw as fucj
Instead of slapping the chicken could you build a rig that compresses the air and decompresses and cook it that way.
Humanity has reached its peak
Is that chicken because u said steak
This guy's been beating his meat for months now
Next video: heating a cup of coffee with screams
One Holy SLAPP from Davie504 will cook the chicken.
@Davie504 #Davie504 this is what you want😂
mark rober little brother?????
use car crankshaft
Meat beater.. 😂😂😂😂🍖
Du another wer u eat the chicken tho
The next think you need to do is boiling water by slapping it thats gonna be haaaaard
well guys, he did it
Now sear it
8888th comment
Lol, Indian parents have been cooking thier children for years by slapping them.
uuuuh can you replace the slapper with a hand
Unus Annus unus annus
Collab with Mark Rober?
Beat dat Meat...
If Matpat doesn’t cover this... I swear... he just better...
Next you must boil water by blowing on it
humans we have reached peak performance
One holy slap instant cooked by Davie
meat beater 9000 😏
Bro i don't know why but you sound a litle bit like fundy
why would someone waste their time, money and energy for slapping a chicken to be cooked I don’t get it 😩
This wasnt her original idea.. i saw a video that was doing exactly the same thing like.. 1 or 1 and a half year before but he did it well i enyoyed this video :)
Wouldn't it make sense to make a slapping wheel, like a helm? But instead of handles you got some flexible sheet to slap the shit out of it at 3000 slaps per minute. I think this would not smash the meat.
MEAT BEATER 9000 LOL
Impressive first step, BUT what you've done is killed bacteria. NEXT step is the maillard reaction to break down amino acids, reduce sugars, and get that nice browning on the surface.  For that you want a temperature of 140 to 165 degrees C.  So there's your challenge.
someone notify Kyle hill right now
Gotta slap it at Mach 5 for optimal results
Slap sous vide chicken
This guy is the lovechild of William Osman and Mark Rober and I love it
„How would you prefer you steak, Sir?“  „Slapped please“
This is why the internet is glorious
This is worth a sub and this is the first one of your videos in my recommended
He talks like Mark Rober
69420 slaps... Truly a man of science!
I have exam tomorrow
im glad that i was here today
The original   *m   e   a   t      b   e   a   t   e   r*
Isnt farenheit considered more accurate?
Great vid!
Gordon Ramsay after seeing this:          Interesting
How do you want your steak sir      I want it slapped to a perfect medium rare
Stupidity 🤦‍♂️
Dare I say that this chicken slaps
Me reading the live comments: „Beat the meat“
at the end of the day, it's still not a chicken.
i read this as "I Cooked a Children by Slapping It"
Oh god he did it!
I was hoping you did it in one powerful slap
davie504 is watching
PLEASE for the love of theory. do a colab with GAME THEORY( food theory)
Whenever I hear slapper, it reminded me of redo of healer
I study physics, and this question had always made me piss myself laughing every time I see the meme... I can't believe you actually did this. You are a legend in my eyes. Now I can go tell my daughter the approx. answer. She's gonna be stunned. Thank you.
This is why i wanna be an engineer so i could assert DOMINANCE AGAINST CHICKENS
Mark rober need to collab with this guys 👍🏻👍🏻
he tenderized it to perfection
“Original meat beater”
Interesting
Real science
Best music
As a cook your times and temps on that are wrong.... it would reach the same pasteurization at 145 degrees (63c) if held there for 8.5 hrs.
Me waiting for him to be the winner winner chicken dinner.  •o•
i swear i read children
You switched the steak when you disappeared with it to rinse it. Also, killing bacteria isn't the only reason we cook meat one would say. Like how could you not know that raw meat tastes no way like when it's cooled(properly).
Thank God the temp is in Celsius
Gordan Ramsey needs to react to this
So you didn't cooked a chicken, but steak Misleading title Unsubscribed
I felt like I saw jake Paul when he said let’s eat it in the start of the video
I heard Mark Rober music in this video...
Davie504 hungry af right now watching this
He could do, what Unus Annus couldn't.
Wait this is adult support toy???
Introducting our new menu, Freshly slapped chicken...
Ok, do it in 1 slap
The temperature Plato happens with meats I think it is a temperature where fat starts to liquefy, the changing of state keeps it from rising in temperature for a time, but when it gets past this point watch out it will rise in temperature quick. Just my observations.
6:39 me opening the browser after a long day
Beating your meat gone wrong
Okay, I have a gas cooker
Someone show gordon ramsay
Me when using my left 😯
I can do better with a right hand
This guy should win a prize for his ingenuity, and the whole fact that he slapped a chicken till it was cooked.
U still didn't do it but good try
"I made a chicken by slapping it"  Me:thats what she said
Oven: am i a joke to you?
Should have used a spring and a roller cam on the motor.
I'm curious if we look at this in 100 years time if we still find it ok to make a light video about slapping an animal carcass untill it heats.
“Beat the life out of it” the steak 🥩 am I a joke to you?
Worst video ever
He literally beat his meat
Hey Jello got his question answered
He’s using the same music that mark rober uses and it hits different
"Dude let's go camping" "Wait lemme cook my chicken first" "Papapapapapapapaapappapapapaapapaoapaopa"
The real way to cook
Me being a Hello Fresh employee going "Hey I know that recipe, yeah we ran out of carrots for two hours." Good to know you enjoy the food!!
9:15 prawy górny, który Polak XDD
Guess u can say he was beating.... I'll leave that for the imagination
Celsius is not used for science, the scientific unit for temperature is kelvin
ahhhh yes. The engineering method.
Song at the beginning (the third one) is Fasion - Dansez
Can you redo this with the circle hole to well have less break ing
What did the Chicken do to deserve this?

Davie 504 should watch this
Lol, i think when he went to the bathroom he swaped the stake lol
Omg, the dedication 😂 goodjob man 👍

Actually you would use kelvin not C if you're going full on scientific
Tonight I'll be eating: *SLAPPED CHICKEN*

They said it couldnt be done they said it was impossible
Wow

Is it just me or does this guy give Mark Rober vibes?
Ayyy happy for you getting that sponsorrrrr thanks for answering the question we were all asking, you’re the best
memento mori   if you know you know
if you make a wheel with fly swatters then you can get more slaps i sec an you can more then 1 slapper on
This is a Drake and Josh meets iCarly episode 😲
Wow!
What if Jotaro's Star Platinum slaps a chicken with a Time Stop ability. Imagine...
He stole Mark Robers music
Me "Goes to a restaurant" :  Let me have your finest slapped meat good sir
Would it killed you to have seasoned it, even just a little bit?
YOOOOO YOU MADE IT ON TRENDING GGOOD JOB
@Davie504
What a legend
Mark rober vibes
"meat beater"
After 2 months of waiting, he finally did it. This is a big step for humanity, congrats!
meat beater is the name you came up with?
MARK ROBER MUSIC BOYZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
dad whats dinner? *slaps chicken*  there it is son
Peak of humanity right here
The algorithm's really picked up your video. Good job dude!!
whats name of the first song
Mom: What are you watching? Me: I'm watching a guy beat his meat. Mom: NANI!!!!!!??
So hello fresh will deliver you a raw chicken and tell in the instructions to slap it 135000 times?
You’re like mark rober but a slapper
"69,420" pass the b bro
Had to watch this on mute
Yes you technically did it. But your rig broke and you didn't eat it. It's not over, rebuild and do it right.
This guy literally didn't give up
Gordon Ramsay wants to know your location
Fahrenheit is the superior temperature unit of measurement.  Think about it... 55° - 60° C doesn’t even sound hot You know what does sound hot 131° - 140° F Also in the name:  C = Cold 🥶  F = F*ck that’s hot 🥵 or flamin hot Doritos, etc.  Now you Europeans, or men of science will argue this; but I will compromises and say this: Kph is a superior unit of speed.  I’ve said my peace...
Imagine being a chicken and having your corpse get slapped thousands of times
Man for some reason you remind of Mark Rober
You've succeeded where Unus Annus failed. Congratulations.
Would you say this an effective way to cook your food?
So the Russian badger was right
Unus and Anus did this with their own hands. lore says they're still slapping the chicken in the great beyond
Behold perry the platypus, THE CHICKEN SLAP-INATOR!!!
sir please make a machine that makes drinkable water from salty water   WE CAN SAVE THE WORLD WITH YOUR PASSION
Bro you can’t steel the working noise from mark. Not cool bro
No chickens were harmed during the making of this video
Meanwhile on Ripley's believe it or not
New Mark Rober????
“The original meat beater “🤣🤣 nahhh we all know what’s the original meat beater
11:54  jebać disa xD
When you lend the quiet kid in your class the science notes
Okay but you didn’t season it first??? The science is badass, but unseasoned chicken (and steak) is just sad
Fast
Gordon Ramsey be like: BRUH
if you are dutch watch zondag met lubbach hellow fresh
when your homie says he's beating his meat
After all that, you used a plastic knife and fork lol
Slaps girlfriend You looked cold babe Just trying to make you even hotter then you already are
Some one needs to send a link to this vid to the Russianbadger
What's up SLAPPER
Is this the Workshop of Peter Sripol?
I got an Arby’s ad
“Meat beater 9000”
What do you mean the steak was bad? It was super tender like liver? People pay 40 to 50$ a lb for a fork tender steak. Salt ,pepper and sear it for 2 min on each side and you have 100$ steak
gg everybody
Can you do it with a life chicken?
ABC steak, already been chewed.
Your not you when your hungry
Mark robers been real quiet since this came out
So, you didn't cook chicken but stake
135,000 slaps OR 1 falcon punch
This will be me after college
1:05, MeAt BeAtEr
What's the music at 5:50

We all know davie 504 secretly helped out with this project
Davie504 would be so proud.
*W*
Chuck Norris do this with one Hand and one Slap. 👋
Suppa hot slap 🥵🥵
Modern Scientist..  -  Invent Flying Car (X) - Invent Chicken Cooking-Slappin Machine  (✓)
we all know he switched out the steak when he went to throw the juice 😂😂 lol jk . but who knows🙄😉
Why is Celsius considered so much better when it has less descriptive degrees than Fahrenheit does? Just because it rounds out nicely?
Wow amazing
Now this is science
Gordon Ramsay and Davie504 should see this
The legendary meat beater  #Respect
Peter you channel is awesome to been watching for few years now. Just found this amazing channel. Gonna be for awhile now. Love when boring science can be fun and exciting. And Louis we appreciate the amazing video on top of the science.
Nope
All that for a *COOKED PIECE OF MEAT??!?*
This man made TheRussianBadgers friend’s, dream come true (one of his friends asked “if physical energy can be turned into thermal, how hard do I have to punch a chicken to cook it?”)
I should go to sleep but this is more important
meat beater is back
Imagine if his mom just asked what he was doing, and he said:   *"just beating my meat"*
why plastic silverware omg
I think the stake he made was a small missteak
I guess you can say he was beating his meat
Damn. I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S BEEN 2 MONTHS. and i never knew i needed this.
Welcome to another episode of "Quarantine with YouTube"
Its also tenderized waaaay too much And because that it feels horrible 🤣
Repent of your sins and turn to God, for the kingdom of Heaven is near. Matthew 3:2  Jesus loves you : ) Never give up on your life!
why not slap something that transferes the heat to the meat

It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.

at 11:55 you have some polish profanity by a guy with the nickname that loosely translates to "minced luncheon" .. may wanna blur that out or something. lmao
Probably better cut of meat next time
How fast the chicken need to run to be cooked?
I'm no scientist so I could be wrong, but I think that a solid slapper (the metal part that actually makes contact with the chicken) wouldn't be the best. I feel like something that more resembled a hand would work better, since if you slap someone with a hand, it stings, which I think would generate more heat, possibly more than something that just hits it. Again, I could be wrong, I just feel like that could be better. Could be wrong tho.
memento mori :((((
Chicken: "Harderrrr!"
People argue on how to make the most tender steak. Why not tenderize and cook at the same time?
Did this guy just beat the meat and eat it
now this is why we have youtube. watch and learn "content creators"
One the most difficult engineering issues solving... that's a real dose of science 🤣

“It smells like (dearth Vader noise)”
Yes
Instead of hard slapping using steel, why not using rubber slapper (like truck mud flaps) set on a rotary wheel, you can also put several rubber slapper on a single wheel. Worth to try? I think so
Next time try using a live chicken

Is it just me or the music, the way he talks, and the way this was edited is really simmilar to Mark Rover?
I feel like he is copying mark Robber
That shit raw still mooing
nice 369k subs keep up the good work dude
You did It, you crazy son of a b*tch, you did it
Yeah you forgot to put salt on it
i applaude the ridiculous science, but to be honest... that steak seems completely fake. you slapped it from the top and presumably bottom, so why are the sides "cooked" ? also the limit between the brown outside and red inside probably should be less clean. you hammered a regular steak for the texture and then tossed it in a frypan.
Humanity's biggest accomplishment   Going to the moon: ❌   Cooked a chicken by slapping: ✔️
There is a parallel universe in which we have giant slappers instead of furnaces

Microwaves do it better.
Cooking chicken regularly is for virgins,   All my chad homies cook it with *slap*

This is probably the smartest dumb idea I've ever seen
XD I thought you gave up nice to see you trying again
Nobody:  Me every night
I don't know how much it would add to the cost, but wouldn't some of the issues with breaking be fixed if there were shock absorbers between the slapping plate and the arm? It wouldn't stop so suddenly when it hit the object and therefor vibrate less?
*****FFFFFFIIIIIIIINNNNNNAAAAAAAALLLYYYYYY*****
Heyyy, I usually prepare my meat by slapping it also

This is NOT what people mean when they ask if you beat your meat
If there is slap chop,there is slap cook
Hmm Davie504 would use HOLY SLAPP
This is amazing but you don't have to copy "Stuff Made Here"'s thumbnails and use Mark Robbers background music. You should have your own personal look
This man is an absolute legend
No wonder children who don't get slapped get spoiled
This guy just literally beat his meat so fast.
He cooked a chicken by slapping it
“When we couldn’t reach the stars, we focused on the science we had at our feet...”
I've traveled far from russian badger to this video.. youtube is weird place
Then my father can produce too much energy
Love the video, but use some weight to hold the entire platform down. That's the reason the bolt broke in the first place, engineering 101.
plot twist he cooked it while we weren’t looking
nah its still raw. good luck with that slap
Wait did you just use the same backing track as Mark Rober? Threw me off a little there! lol  Now back to the video 🤓
For safety .... the temperature should reach 72 C - it is the temperature that kills the harmful bacteria and makes it safe to eat.
11:56 Nawet tutaj jebią Disa na czacie
What a legend. They said it couldn't be done. But he did it.
can i use this to slap my step sis's ass?

I remember when this man only has like 1-5k views on his vids
Ya'll havin fun till the chicken starts screami'n daddy
Where is the seasoning
Hey this guy looks like the other one which he makes you watch the full video
11:54 jebać disa jebać disa???
9:21 jebac disa B)
Cool that this happened. I was wondering if the bolt should have been an actual shaft. I see why it's not very practical for basically a garage project, but you'd probably want a lot more rigid base for the slapper as well, so much bending and movement in the base itself. Just an assumption but that might eat quite a bit of efficiency and introduce plenty of breaking points (you know, just the strain from vibration already).
you should do a colab with mark rober
Remember: practice makes perfect
He didn't give up?
YOU FIIIIIIIIIIINAAAAAAALYYYYYY DID IIIIIIIITTTTTTT
Is it just me or is this guy trying to be Mark Rober
He's the type of guy who will create a rocket to launch a flat earther into space

Iv waited so long to see your success
Vegetarians hate this trick

White folks never cook their meat properly always eating salted rare meat 🤢 Chicken was rare bro omg... wtf

Just one slap from Vasily kamotsky should overcook the chicken, hell It might even burn the chicken.
Perseverance is yours!!

This reminded me of that one unus annus video
This is it chief
Liar you did not cook a chicken the steak looks good though
Davie504 bring me here..
Every boys in a 10 mile radius: Guess I'm cooked
hey you should put the meat in a marinade then put it in a bag so it could be cooked with spices

You did it, you son of your mother, you actually did it
Meat beater😂😂😂😂😂😂
Davie504 Aprroved👍
"jebać disa jebać disa jebać disa jebać disa jebać disa jebać disa jebać disa jebać disa jebać disa " XDDDD
I am both impressed and grossed out.
Davie504 must watch it.
I'm gonna have to sub just because of this dude's determination, plus he cooked a chicken by slapping it.
Was it chewy? We call that al dente
The things I find to watch at night are undefeated 😂😂
Finally... a proper way to cook my chicken
Hello fresh just fired a shit ton of employees a few weeks ago. Good to see their saved money went to sponsoring you...
And it's full of chloride
Honestly if you heard the first bits of, "The original meat beater wasn't all that fast" you'd assume things that were not actually going on.
Him: *eats chicken* Chicken: Salmonella
Pog
Imagine cooking the stake then Putting it back in the bag and then over reacting that u cooked it in the slapper,         (Its a dumb joke)
The Meat Beater 20k will be made entirely of milled titanium, will run off a 200 horsepower v6 diesel engine, and will be rated to operate at peak slappage for an estimated 400 trillion staps. Order now for zero percent APR financing and no down payment.
This is on my recommended lol
yes
Hecking LEGEND
Dude just use the oven
Who cooks meat in a normal pan lol
You sound like Mark Rober.
"Meat beater" 😂
mid exams in 15 minutes me : ok lemme watch chicken slaps first
when your bored in quarantine :
I want Gordon Ramsay to react to this 😂
So... How many people would it take to cook a chicken by slapping it 135,000 times?
The chicken that died for this video: 👁👄👁
This guy is like the second Mark Robber
Kid: I wanna invent useful things. The kid later:
I like how pointless this is
You seriously proved that "Practice makes a man perfect"
I remember seeing these Livestreams just sitting there in my recommended.  Man finally did it
So you cook a steak by slapping the crap out of it, not bad. Another step for Weird Science. Huzzah!
dont u use kelvin for science?
vegans be like: this is animal cruelty :'(, don't slap the poor chicken
W
Wanna know how i know you are gay? Because you say “Lets Gooo!!”
I study chemistry and can assure you that the correct scientifical temperature eould be kelvin lol
My guy just made history. Proud of you.
What a waste of intelligence
i am amazed
mark rober vibes.......background sound and gooo baabyyyyy
What.
hi im new subscriber , i like something out of the box
hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm interesting...............................
So if my mom slapped me then she's trying to cook me right?
Gordon Ramsay: "Finally, some good fucking food"
9:21 jebac disa
Give this man an award
Talking about efficiency at the end there. I wonder how it would compare to the oven if the heat generated by the variac and motors could also be utilised for cooking. Maybe using a heat pump or something. I understand of course that this detracts from the purity of the slap.
No tilte ever got my attention like this
look how happy he is when he gets his steak
But can you slap bass with that?
Lets play with nature, can you cook a chicken with lightning
What a wonder, slapping a chicken became a steak.....wooowww
Moral of the story: you dont. Need chemical potential energy or heat energy to cook
Momento Mori
Introducing the one and only "Meat beater that cooks"
Hold up where is guga foods when you need him, surely this is a challenge for him to tenderize and cook at the same time he also loves vac bags
Thats how davie504 cooks his food all the time
9:21 in chat.....polish people are everywhere, but JD
Its 4 am and this is the video i never knew i needed to waste my insomnia.
2:51 am watching this when you said its like 2:50 am lol
We can now reference this
Tenderized to the max
Unus Annus crawled so that Louis Weisz could  f l y
That's epic *Eats Tinola*
Next video idea "I cooked a chicken by slapping it... once"
Das beef.
" I wanted more than anything to eat a meal cookedby slaps" haha, that just sounds rediculous
can u beat wood to a campfire?
This brings a whole new meaning to "beating your meat"
Mark rober fans when the music comes on:  "Hey i've seen this"
It has to be at a temperature for a long time at that pace
Oof that chickens  butt
*MADLAD*
Now we can say to the younger generation that we can cook a chicken by slapping it
Mom : What are you doing?  Me : I am watching a man beating his meat.  Mom and every other person : WHAT!!?
Who's from Memetastic's community post?
Why are you converting rotary motion into linear motion if you can have linear motor and have better efficiency and less broken parts??
no. you were not the first one who managed to do it. an youtuber called balian has done it before in a similar way.
Grab me that slapper...
Scientists who say Ope? Sign me up please
Click bait
"How do you like your Chicken sir?"  *"MEDIUM SLAPPED PLS"*
Congratulations!
imagine not watercooling your chicken slapper smh. Amateur work Louis.
Who agree that he should do a collab with The Action Lab?
The texture is kinda sh*T
Sutch violence, technically successful results.
9:42 he clear goes and get a steak handed off already cooked.
That's so gay watching something beating the meat
Watching this video while grilling some wings
meat beater....
This is the silly mark rober
This type of content is one of the few reasons that keep YouTube alive.
Americans love Fahrenheit because it is a Big number.
SIKE!
You mean that I've been cooking my meat for the past 10 years?
imagine the chicken dying just to be slapped alot
why is this #17 trending and why am i still watching this. well your doing something right
This song
I feel like i am watching a Mark Rober video.
This sort of content is why I watch youtube
what a time to be alive
*meat beater....* pfffftttt....
2:19 u think the entierty of europe is communist? somebody clearly didnt go to history class
Did you get sick yet?
name of tune in the beginning?
Son: dad, what is he doing?  Dad: he is beating his meat
Background music got me thinking this is a mark rober video y’all sound the same and y’all both smart
Bro you wasted so much foood making these vids
"How bored are you?"     This guy: well uh
he's super annoying tbh
This is the sequel we needed
9:21 JEB*Ć DISA in chat
And thus Sex Machines were born
And so the abomination of Chicken torture finally happened... again.
Is that an world Record?

I bet that chicken slaps tho 😂
9:45 "I know it doesn't look that good right now... But whatch THIS!"
In Russia One Whole slap can cook a Whole Turkey .
when you take it out, add a bit of salt, like much salt, so it taste good
Waiter: How do you want your chi  Me: Slapped on both sides medium well done but not to dry.

Thats what i call beating meat
Gordon ramsay: The chicken is fucking raw and rancid FUCKING SHIT!!
This video deserves a ton of recognition!
Too much effort on  an useless experiment
OH LOOK AT THIS  Walks out of frame....  Comes back with perfectly cooked steak..  Sure....
Fake
HOLY FUCKING SHIT YOU DID IT

The return of the king
Davie504 approves
Jerry Sienfeld at 9:47 😅
Imagine if you were the chicken who ended up being used for the experiment, and you knew this is what was going to happen to your dead body.
If fysical energy can be turned too thermal energy  How hard would you have to punch a chicken too cook it A russian badger video 2019
https://youtu.be/Na3uv4j63WM;
Use that slap steak in a burger
You did it

White people not seasoning their chicken smh
Guga Foods: "I know my steak doesn't look good right now, but watch this!"

You have done the work of Gods.
Davie504: "This is perfect"

Who else is here before this video hits 10 mln views?
Super duper duper proud of you dude! Keep up the amazing and creative thinking?- best of luck on other inventions! 😁✨🌸
Finally, a real chicken slappinator
The next mark rober
Damnnnnn ........after the last video thought this was impossible
Now slap a bass till it's cooked
0:57 - recap ends, video begins
omg you're back
Cook a chicken via vibration
I have an idea on how to cook a chicken with slaps, put it in the oven, break the glass on the oven, put the chicken inside the oven and then get the slap machine and slap the chicken
https://youtu.be/-RAglyw6ySk
god this dude is annoying
Davie504 will do this soon, I challenge him to do this with his HOLY SLAPP
The moment of truth
Me: *chuckled to one of unus annus's video of Mark & Ethan slapping a chicken in attempt to cook it a few months ago* YouTube: "So do you wanna see it done now?"
dude, you're losing power to the spring, invest in some high tension wire
Those chickens died for the science they're heroes. *RESPECT*
Humanity just won the Game of Life
Should’ve known HPC would be here too lol.
SCIENCE HAS GONE TOO FAR
madman
I love how the twitch chat spams "slap the meat"
Number 1. I love this.... Number 2... nice job being Mark Rober
Me : I have an exam tomorrow, I should probably sleep  Also me :

Disappointing....... You know the saga isn't over until you eat it!
The measure used in laboratories is Kelvin

Title:"I cooked a chicken by slapping it" 1.9 million people"INTERESTING
NO WAY IT HAPPENED
9:21 Taktyczne JD
When he said the meat beater i almost spat my brain out
You give me that mark rober feeling
It's all fun and games until the chicken says Harder Daddy
This is the best Hello Fresh ad ever.
Girlfriend: "Harder."  This guy: *Brings up chicken slapper MB9001
Imagine if this man slaps his girl in the ass and she moans "Slap me like one of your Rotisserie chicken."
Badger here you go
Yey!

Actual footage of the equivalent speed of mom whipping her kid after they said "shut up mom"
I’m so happy this guy is blowing up
Haven't watched yet, paused at 0:41 this is my first visit to your channel. No offense but from an engineering standpoint its quite simple. So not sure what you mean, In fact machines to suit this purpose have been in use for decades. But have to admit I'm curious to see how you will reinvent the wheel. And yes I am a mechanical engineer. So guess I will watch to the end, and will try to refrain from making too many condescending remarks. Mostly because I will admit it never occurred to me to use this method to cook a chicken. Usually the concern is the reverse, devising ways to counter over heating.  OK watched the whole thing, surprisingly entertaining, having no idea of your education I would say its either very impressive or a little embarrassing. If you have some engineering background, and were in my class I would give you 2 out of 5 stars for initial design, 1 out of 5 for choice of materials. It might score high at a high school science fair, but not so good as an engineering project. Over all (some students would say I'm so uptight you couldn't pull a pin out of my ass with bulldozer) I am hard to please, but that was very entertaining so 5 out of 5 for the purpose it was intended. 😁👍👍👍👍👍
I just realized that baking chicken is actually just air particles slapping the chicken at super high speeds until it's cooked.
Dkw but i feel like How to Basic
You should do a series of different crazy ways of cooking chicken, like the way Major Hardware does his fan showdown series of testing different fan designs.
Mexican and asian mother: I'll take your entire stocks
Who is here from Memenastic?
That Meat beater is over 9000
Imagine beating your meat til it burns
Mark rober in the 5th dimension
Everything about this is fake.
Wow!
People nextdoor be like:Wait he is not doing I think he is
*sees meat beater 9000* Sir.... *BRING ME THAT DEVICE*
Who got flashbacks from Unus Annus?
When will society progress to the point where slaps are a reliableーmaybe even preferredーcooking method
Anyone remember when he still had 100k?
Plot twist:
Mark rober 2.0
You have no idea how happy I am to see a part two of this
The music makes me think of Mark Rober and the music he uses. Which I don’t like.
It was nice seeing adam regusea feature
You say you're going to eat food cooked by the power of slaps no matter the cost. But apparently if the cost is salmonella then that's too high.
alt title "MAN USES SCIENCE TO BEAT HIS MEAT!"   "youtube algorithm: -.- ......demonitized"
Is this mark 😂 ?? My man reminds me of mark rober
How many chokes to cook a chicken
Me: Mom can we buy an oven  Mom: No we already have an oven at home   The oven at home:
I learned more Physics with this video than at my high school.Thank You
Next video: how many slaps does it take to cook an a5 300 dollar wagyu steak
You are here for 9:30
Got to admit that I was disappointed you were using 1 time use materials to eat the steak. With all the effort to cook it, why not use an actual steak knife!?
-How is your girlfriend? -She is well done.
Im really skeptical about this, I don't really know where to start except for this way of erm.. "cooking" being NOT safe at all. Looking at microbiological quality.
Still got me round how we can eat raw eggs but not raw chicken.
Ngl the sponsor is really appropriate on the vid
Is it just me or he talks like Mark Rober?
I am amazed not by the fact you can cook a chicken with slaps, but by the fact that this can be one of the newest hardcore bdsm machines no one has ever thought of
Props to this guy for spending so much time and effort on something completely pointless
Part of me is convinced this is faked
Actually its supposed to be 175 internal
This man really turned a regular steak into extra soft filet mignon using the power of SLAPS
The shoes doe 😩🥵
Waiter: How would you like your steak? Luois: SLAPPED
Honestly with the meat beater I was thinking you were going to use the gearbox
9:46 he clearly sound like tyler from dude perfect unfortunate game
Davie504 would be proud
3:33 Nice 😉
XRP = $$$$
I was less excited for endgame ngl
Mark and Ethan: _heavy breathing_
Waiting for Chicken Slaps is opening on your city..
A monumental moment in history, I'm glad to be here
The name of the stream should be cooking stream
Is it just me or he sound like mark robert?
9:21 of course poles from JD culture would show up
I've been waiting for this since the failed video last time
I am participating in f*cking YouTube history! And so are you!
Can you make me one of those fast slapping arms 👀 need it for experiment
Who told this man to use Celsius? It obviously should of been Kelvin, even more so since he's converting kinetic energy into heat.
1:56 *HMMM*
Just know if the somehow the chicken gets back alive it will slap back 🐔🐔
Davie504 wants to know your location 👏👏
Copiou o Balian

This gives a whole new meaning to beating meat
What are you doing? Louis: Beating my meat on Youtube
Beatin yer meat takes on a whole new definition
Im sorry but a can't eat anything that is medium rare that shit is still bloody
who uses too much effort to cook a chicken? 🤔🤔🤔
11:55 ah, człowiek kultury na czacie
Earned a sub from me I’m straight wow’d
"Your goose is cooked," -bad -nobody eats geese regularly -outdated and overused -it normally doesn't take much effort to cook a goose "Your chicken is slapped," -good -everybody likes chicken -modern, never before seen -it takes much effort to cook a chicken with slaps
Gordon Ramsay has left the chat
Another disappointing click bait video
you did it such a tasty victory
Good work, Louis!
Backround music just reminds me of Mark Rober
The steak literally blew my mind man, how??
Flashbacks
7:41 PewDiePie

He ate his beat meat
Slap it babyy
the mad lad did it
this felt like a mark rober video and i love it
Why have I Ben so invested into a machine called the meat beat 9000
Could you imagine how tender that steak is after being hit that much?
*but....why* ?
I can't believe I just watched an entire series of a man trying to beat his meat with a makeshift cooker.
Ha hesaid meat beater 1:06
Someones been watching russianbadger videos
Seems like it would have made more sense to just use Fahrenheit lol...
Someone tell @kylehill
holy woa
When the quiet guy take the joke too far on cooking a chicken only with slaps:
Lol he even copied Mark Robers background music 😂
No chickens were harmed in the making of this video...  They were already dead
Chicken: Why are we here still here just to suffer
Now... mount a camera on it :)
*Hey, to you reading* .... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
What are you doing step MB9001
Now you have to make a machine that slaps it so hard it cooks in one slap
I can finally cook my wife
I love science...
In the science fair : Behold my invention, The meat beater  Judges : F-
5:47 lol someone said a no no word.  And yes I got so sidetracked I went frame by frame to figure out why it was blurred. And what the person said.
"Can we have Mark Rober?" "We have Mark Rober at home"  Mark Rober at home:
Me : I want ice cream Mom : we have ice cream at home Ice cream at home :
Imagine asking your friend "how do you want your chicken? And they reply " S L A P P E D "
ahhhh yes, the meat beater
Netflix: Are you still watching?  Someone’s daughter: 1:56
Fun fact: the chicken is slapped
Really gettin those mark rober vibes
No one: Me: well, time to beat my meat
Congratulations mate...Was waiting for this since the previous video👏👏👏
My mom used to make me eat my vegetables by the power of slaps when I was a little kid. It worked great and NEVER broke. 👋
That’s Peter Sripol!

WAIT I HAVE BEEN DOING RESEARCH AND IT SAYS USE AN OVEN I JUST FIGURED IT OUT RECENTLY     You can tell I'm stupid
Honestly dog I’m pretty disappointed that I watched a 13 minute video and you didn’t even eat the damn chicken
people who complain about which which unit of measurement is being used are weak
This dude is  an off brand mark rober
YOU ABSOLUTE UNIT!!! You’ve done it!
What a great sponsor 😂😂😂
Davie 504 is like i have competition
So if you slap the shit outta someone you can make them a hot mess
Might have been more editable if you add some spices
Russian badger needs to know this
*Gordon Ramsy wants to know your location*
It tenderized AND COOKED that steak bro I can't this is hilarious
This is the only video of a dude beating his meat I’ll watch
The dumbest video on YouTube
You madman. I remember this question on reddit but I never thought you were serious.  This is amazing

hahaha!
Thank you for risking your stomach for us
PLEASE DONT BE CLICKBAIT
“Nc nc” Davie504
Back in my day when we had no oven we manually slapped our chicken and it made us strong
1) why use a slider in your rotational to reciprocating conversation? Use a crank arm with bearings. 2) the speed of your slapper at impact is decreasing due to the sinusoidal velocity function.  3) I'd probably try a bunch of flexible slappers on a wheel. The impact energy would be determined by the mass and velocity of the slappers. 4) why is the outside of the steak browned?

i slapped the like button hard enough to cook it
Damn. Really on trending.  I remember videos getting less than 1k views, and voting on polls with like 12 people
I swear he sounds like mr.Beast
Lessons in Meme Culture predicted the first guy to do this to become famous in his slapping chicken meme analysing video 2 yrs ago :D just had it in my recommended
Yes, that's what you call ingenuity
All I can understand what he saying is "science, science, science, slap machine"
He is like mark rober

One small step for man one big leap for mankind             I probably got it wrong dont judge
My brain at 3 am:
Your videos are a lot like Mark Rober’s
People in the 50s: in 2021 there will be flying cars   2021:
They say "Necessity is the mother of invention." I think Louis Weisz just proved that sometimes "necessity" has absolutely NOTHING to do with it.
I thought he was mr beast cause his voice💀💀💀💀
Congrats on trending! I remember the second stream!
Everybody gangsta till they salmonella
The Mark Rober music yesss
I will buy any product you promote😂😂😂
Louis deserves his own Netflix show

You, and the people who helped you, are technically the new mythbusters team. Love the content

1:05 meat beater😂😂😂
this dudes literally a meme mark rober and im all for it
Imagine you slapping the chicken 135,000 times
Season the chicken.
Got the toughest meat and beat the life out of it....  Hmm....
If physical energy can be turned into thermal energy how hard would I have to  smack a chicken to cook it.           If you know were this is from your a legend
Anybody here thinking about RussianBadger?
Open a restaurant using this technique. I bet people would flock to it for a while if you featured it properly
Jesus Christ, this video could’ve been cut down to 3 minutes easily and I wouldn’t have wasted so much of my time...  The good bits are good, but so much fluff dude
*Fire was found 2 million years ago* People before that time:*slap slap slap*
My guy doesn’t have a million subs yet. Let’s fix that.
Welcome to the future ladies and gents. I don't care about space exploration or flying cars but this is something I can be a part of.
The vacuum idea wasnt stupid....
How much meat was wasted in the process?? I don‘t support this 😕
Do the same thing with the steak but before your eat it sear the outside
Is this mark rober's son
Live chat going "beat the meat" lmfao🤣🤣🤣
Me and my Dad loved your first video on this and he swore it wouldn't be possible. I kinda agreed but wasn't as firm. I can't wait until he gets out of the hospital with Covid so I can show him this.
This shit has 1.8m views? Damn I wonder how many slaps would it take to make someone shit them selves? Hopefully I'll get 1.8m views too
Imagine ordering a slow slapped chicken sandwich
0:17 he liked his own video... interesting
Tsunderes: *now this looks like a job for me*
There are 2 kinds of people.  those who beat their meat. And those who cook their meat by beating it.
Nice Mark Rober music👌aushontay.
Fxck everything and just use  a tungsten for the engine bolt
Davie504 would like this
So go to 7:42 n tell me that him saying " Im too tired " dnt sound like that part on holes where the lil girl sais " I'm tired of this Grandpa ". Tell me it doesnt tho!!!
Where's Gordon ramsay when it matters?
Yoooooo, dude had me crying when he segways into the HelloFresh ad.
Davie504 would approve of this method of cooking with slaps. Lacks bass though
this man literally just living in peter sripols garage
Well, i'm here before 1 000 000 subs and 10 000 000 views
AYO, I remember the fist video 😌✨ glad it worked out this time 🥳
if it breaks again get bedrock
Imagine this phone call? Yes is this HelloFresh? Would you like to promo your product in a video where I slap my chicken and then eat it?
What kind of do-diddly-nonsense is this?
Ah yes a fellow medium rare chicken fan 😋
@Davie504 would be proud
Beating your meat really works. Who would've thought?
Dang. This will go down in history
When he says: I am beating my meat for scientific purposes
So uh anyone here after watching the Russian badgers video
"Would you like your's fried or grilled?" "Slapped please."
1:03 meat beater😂😂
"The boy down there has been renovating his house for months. Just wish they would stop jackhammering."  him: yeah sorry it's just been me beating my meat on twitch
Unus Annus would be proud.  Memento Mori.
My man playing the mark rober music all the way through
This needs one of those memes where the black guy is like "Heyyy get me on of those"
Is it me or does he sounds like Jimmy MrBeast?
Why is the music so loud?
Boys During Puberty Pathetic
8:17   When someone ask what that hand do.
This was a mistake
Yeah, I'm gonna need to see you piss off the steak community and cook an A5 wyagu steak, or a dry aged, with seasonings of course.
Him: Increase in temperature! His chat: Beat that meat.
So glad to have witnessed the peak of science.
something seems off almost  like it was cooked in a traditional oven and the ported to a bag.
Chicken à la fiberglass
On your point about the chicken cooking temperature, as a chef I OFTEN sous vide chicken to 138, but because of the cook time, its totally safe. The slight pink is always going to take some training to get used to, but its normally just the juice, not the meat. Plus its rediculously good in a Preserved lemon chicken salad.
Yo deserve to be subscribed
If you had brought Davie504 in this would’ve been done in minutes
I think that thing almost detonated on the first try
I guess that's determination
we need davie504 to do it
“You did it. You crazy some of a B, you did it.”
We're part of the history here.... that was incredible...
Finally a chicken slapping mark rober
Let's go, watch another video!
‘Advancement made!’ ‘Uhhh...’
mark rober on cocaine
Nothing like watch some kid slapping his chicken.. How did I land here?
Sir, C° is Celsius, not sea.
Comments: Celsius is used for science Me: * cries in kelvin *
YAAAAS ITS FINALLY COMPLETEEEEEE
Risk of diarria is high
if it was yujiro hanma he would have cooked that chicken in one slap
“The only on earth to be cooked by slaps”   You literally do not know that at all
How did we forget the " F in the chat for the pivot " ? 🙄 So here it goes " F " 😂
lesson learned, if u beat the shit out of it, it will taste like you beat an entire restaurant.
11:51 that's some smooth sponsoring
360k subs and ripping music from Mark Rober with no credit? smh
maybe try to differentiate yourself from Mark Rober instead...
If you would mount a  pressure cooker on the end of the arm it would "shake" or "Slap" the chicken back and forth in the container, if done right you might be able to hit that sweeet spot to maximize the cooking.
I think I entered the wrong human species party. Sorry for the disturbance 🙃🙃
Damn son now that's a meat beater mindset! 👍🏻
Get me that meat beater
Unnus Annus would be proud...
Sunuvabitch. He really did it.
When somedude slapping raw steak has made a steak it take me years to
Yeah but you can eat raw chicken with no problem unless it’s bad quality
Guiness world record when
HE DONE IIIIIIITTTT
The absolute mad lad.
Why am I watching this
As a professional meat beater, I applaud you.
Someone send this to Russianbadger.
All hail the Meat Beater
you posted that vacuum chamber suggestion just to show off that HPC watches you lol
He said meat beater Hehe
I don't think you can get harder, better, faster or stronger. This is the peak of chicken cooking performance 👌🏿
Usually guys just have a satisfied grin on their face after pounding their meat. But holy cow!!! This guy's ecstatic!! Talk about a "Happy Ending"
#shib #elonmusk 👍
Subliminal messaging is getting more creative 🤨
Sorry vegans 🤣
Imagine what the vegan teacher is thinking about while watching this.  L
1:05 The Original Meat-Beater, huh
Did you.... Did you just make something that violates the second law of thermodynamics?
If your hungry and you know it beat your meat!
The people who made ovens:  👀👄👀
DAVIE504 : YESSSS
I fucking love the internet 😂😂
The chicken look at his body that successfull cook by slap from haven.
Yes..beat that MEAT
This really puts the saying slap me harder into motion
Girls: I wonder why we mature faster then boys  Meanwhile, boys: Cooking a chicken by slapping it

Congrats you have wasted you time (Close)❤️                  (No)                     *why are you here*
"I guess the slapper did beat the meat".......   Don't you guys dare🤓
Such a cliche comment, but I'm gonna say it anyway: This is what youtube was made for!
Hi mini mark rober
Meatbeater 9001. You have my fullest attention
Man beats his meat for hours  3.1 mil people: interesting
subscription earned in the first 30 seconds!
"Tastes like i was chewing it for one minute"  No shnaz sherlock
Finally
So Mr Bro had a good idea just not enough physicness/scienceness
maybe slapping is the next hypest and best way to cook a steak. cooking and tenderizing at same time, much slower and more thoroughly than slow and low even sous vide
im here from Memetastic
This guy is a professional dad
nice video but get your own music stop ripping mark rober videos
Parents: Internet is Dangerous    The internet:
i call bullshit not only does that meat look carefully cooked but not even beaten with a spatula not to mention having to conveniently walk off camera ignoring what looks like a change in bubble pattern from your fish tank system
Kelvins are used in real science, mate, still a bit off, but closer. 😂
https://youtu.be/Na3uv4j63WM,
i’m just impressed this guy can beat his meat for 13 minutes and 16 seconds
He really beat his meat hard huh
i hope you will get a world record awards for this method is PRETTY COOL

Cook a chicken by rubbing it
MK1 Slapper, A.K.A. The Meat Beater.
Louis Weisz : yeay i finally cooked a steak using a slapper!!  Davie504 : hold my bass!
75 is safe to eat temperature so if it’s not safe to eat is it really cooked don’t think so cool idea tho
I feel like this machine is trying to challenge my ability to beat meat
i did it a home it worded
I guess u can say this chicken really "slaps"       Idk if this is original I just came up with it
This how Neanderthals cooked dinosaurs before fire was invented
can you cook a chicken using slaps in minecraft? yes you can
This was the dumbest thing I have ever seen, but it was the GREATEST thing I've ever heard of!
you should make another stream, where you give the steak to the top donator.
Davie504 would be proud of you.
Can't believe u really did it, man loved the last video
iQ 1000.
That’s what I call some tender meat
I'd rather use a meat beater. I ordered a few weeks of food from Hello Fresh, and I had open meat bags, wilted and moldy veggies, and warm packages.
Yes but actually yes
FINALLY
U foking wut
Mr beasts brother did this but with his hands and o machine
what a disrespect to a chickens life
How my man cut that steak with a plastic knife
Beatus the meatus
Interesting
now you can open a restaurant and make money from it :)
I watched a person make a slap cooker
I like how you put the exact same music used by a big youtuber over your videos to try get more views. LuL
Vegans be like:👁👄👁
Hes just a culinary version of Mark Rober.
I am waiting for Kyle Hill to comment on this
I hate medium rare meat... You all gringos are weird for eating meat raw
Like I get it... this is cool. But at some point cool just becomes a waste of time and resources. Like I know you can say that about literally anything but I can’t help but feel like all this science could be used for something purposeful or helpful. Idk maybe I’m being nit picky
Cavemen: This is some serious gourmet shit.
Next up Making Gravy with a Waterjet
Simply fantastic. When I watch videos like this, I am always left feeling blissful; that there are no real world problems to apply our monkey minds to.  Someone: those poor chickens
Ahh,  so what your saying is make a wind powered one with a flywheel for continuous rotational slappage
That’s enough internet for today...unless we get Gordon Ramsey’s review. I want to say so many things but the comments already said it all. Omg dude this is insane haha
the fact that it took 108717 slaps without lubrication until the machine tried to kill someone is the real miracle here
No you didn’t. No. Oh my god. Did you actually- You did it.
8:13 song?
Davie504: Approved
Does anybody know the name of the song around 1:50
The madlad actually did it!
Mark rober 2.0 babbyyyyyy
They called you a madman. You prove them wrong
What my meat has nightmares  of
I only like bc 69420

Can you cook a chicken with a magnifying glass
Why does this dude remind me of the No Mans Sky Guy
It looks like your giving the chicken cpr its gonna be alive
1:02 I'm sorry but my mind can't stay still after hearing "the original meat beater"
So.... is there going to be a followup where the chicken is edible and you eat the chicken?
I see The Hydroolic Press channel in there.
jebac disa
@10:18  famous last words before explosive diarrhea 😂
Sit, there is nay an excess of resources nor the time with what’s going on in the world right now to be mechanically slapping your meat to perfection. Maybe invent something useful seeing as you have the time and money, such as a right wing political movement or a new kind of cuisine that uses unused ingredients according to whatever ingredients are widely unused right now. Cheers
Damn, that guy knows how to beat meat like no other!
does hello fresh have a recipe for the meat beater 9001?
1:55 kinda sus
Have ever heard that there is a fire , microwave , oven , griller ? Seems not
do it with stake
*Man beats and eats his meat*
Fire was invented 2 millions of years ago People before 2 millions of years ago:
You could've just slapped it once at mach 13.6
Should have called it "The beat meater"
Meat beating chicken choker... But seriously awesome god job
Watching this at 3 am because i have nothing else to do
But wait why do you need to kill those bacteria with heat if you already killed them by hit
this was the right sponsor for this video
The Meat Beater 🍖
Now he needs to make the high impact chicken slapper
When people say "LETS GO" where do they mean? Over there?
Poor chicken
9:21 tak jest jebać kurwe JD
So...I guess the idea of 'slapped ham' is more realistic than one might assume?
You should sell these machines.
wait did the slap machine turn the chicken into a steak or did i skip a few parts of the vid
Did I really just watch a man beat his meat for 13 minutes and 16 seconds
I can’t imagine how much the testing costed just to cook a piece of chicken with the power of slaps
me to the bags of soil at the store
Inb4 this explodes on reddit and meme communities
Alternate smart brain
I wouldnt eat a chicken that took 2 months to cook
His voice sounds like cut voice lines for Linus Tech Tips.
He is eating it raw
Did I just watch a guy beat his meat for 13min straight
This is very important
imagine open a restaurant that sell slapped meet
the first thing i thought was LIESSSS
Someone get JelloPuddin
is meat beater 9001 up for sell?
https://youtu.be/VTAVTr3Eh3w
I'm sure the chicken will be honoured to be the first chicken be serve from slapping
Fun video - but why the Mark Rober music? You’re doing cool enough stuff, build your unique brand 🎶👍🏼 keep it up ☀️
Não sei se vcs sabem mas isso e uma invensão brasileira

Not a clue why I clicked on this...
Jebac disa XD
haha...  meat beater..
At 9:21 in the chat it says (in Croatian) Fucker disa Fucker disa...
I don’t think I’ve been more proud 🥲☺️. Glad you stuck with it and it worked!
Finally... The chicken is on fire...
Could you do it with indirect contact, using the slaps to heat up the surface the chicken/steak is on?
Finally, our generation is doing something worthwhile
Celsius isn't used for real science, Kelvin is. One Kelvin spans the same range as one degree Celsius but is part of an absolute scale, meaning the temperature scale ranges from the very coldest something can possibly be (zero kelvin = -273 degrees Celsius) to the very hottest (this is theoretically infinite). In your next chicken slap related experiment, be sure to use SI units like Kelvin to solidify this as real science. ;-)
Okay???
we have peaked as a society
We've found it,  we can punch a chicken to cook it
😆 went from an "age old question" or trying something somebody tried to do with hands until now engineering the method rofl. Its like trying to build the pyramids the old fashioned method but with modern technology. Mildly entertaining though & great way to JUST get viewers from bored ppl
Gordon Ramsay went quiet after this video came out.
*BEAT THE MEAT*
3:49 Jinxed it
This takes beating your meat to a whole new level.
YES!
I don't see why he didn't make a flexible paddle wheel so that with each rotation of the wheel multiple flexible paddles would slap the shit outta that bird! I mean to me that just sounds like a less breakable design, but I am probably missing all kinds of factors.
I literally just came from Therussianbadger's video where they were talking about "How hard would I have to punch a chicken to cook it"
9:20 jebać disa xDDDDD
You can cook the chicken, AND every piece of tech used to cook it!
I’m going to tell my grandkids this was Gordon Ramsay

This was multiple hits not slaps. Should have been slapping it with a flat whip like motion!
*insert obligatory day after NNN joke*
Jebać Disa, it gets everywhere
the young mrk rober even the same music u guys should do a colab
same music and video style as Mark Robber. Where are the credits...
Hum.... beating meat cooks it.... Explains a lot
I'm sad I didn't subscribe sooner
This guy is like the low budget hacksmith, I love it
What a way to treat someone who has died. This isn't cool, what if it was a human body? Your brother, sister? Friend? Mother? Father?  This chicken was that to other chickens. you're sick. At the end of the day, that's a dead body and you are beating it's carcass. Thanks, you inconsiderate dick
if i have to rate u you a mark rober in everything even music
Me: can we have mark rober Mom: we already have mark rober at home Mark rober at home:
I have never seen anyone beat his meat with this much determination.
Well the effort was there but let's face it that was definitely not cooked. That steak was pretty rare and rare means not cooked. 🤣
This video was in the briefcase in Pulp Fiction. This video wakes the sun up for school. This video got the whole town drunk off a sip of wine. This video invented tooth paste. This video is now available on DVD. MY HEAVENS. GEE WHIZ. GOOD LORD.
Yo he’s a sneakerhead
Something that Unus Annus failed to achieve.
9:21 JD
any other unus annus fans stumble upon this video and nearly drop their device or was it just me-
please give me that meat beater ..
THE QUESTION HAVE THE ANWSER
Congratulations you man of science. Next run, chicken rubbing. Rub a chicken similar to rubbing your hands together to produce heat until it's cooked.
Lol
I think I cooked the like button....
It's a real knee slapper
Unus Annus attempted this manually
So..beating steak to cooked is pretty much un fried schnitzel.
So thats how they make school burgers
Ha chicken go brrrrrr

How to solve world hunger? Step 1: Clone Chickens. Step 2: Raise and feed said Chicken Clones. Step 3 : When Clone Chickens are large enough, TELL THEM ALL TO SQUARE UP.
You should've done it with a living chicken to prove the haters that the chicken was indeed real.

You are just making the world more harder not easier.
Imagine this in a kink session😵😵
"Wtf is milk steak? I like slap steak."
This dude takes beating meat to a whole other level
so guy beats his meat and then eats the meat....Youtube is the greatest place ever
Sell it to a michelin star restaurant

From slapping the chicken to, Back to beating the bologna,
You ate completly wrong about keeping the chicken at 60 degrees cels before it has reached 74 degress is literally like leaving a piece of chicken out on a black rock in the desert and then claiming its edible,essentially quickly rotting carcass instead of edible meat u cluesless fool
I can’t believe mark rober copied you
A meat beater has an alternative meaning ...
Dude builds a brand new, scientifically sound machine to cook chicken through kinetic force alone.  Still doesn't season it.
After watching the previous videos on the slapper several months ago, I never thought you'd actually fucking manage it, you absolute legend! Hahah
Makes me think of a time when I was doing work on my boss’s trailer many years ago, since this is fundamentally this is about “energy is neither created nor destroyed”. Was trying to get a bolt off holding the number plate on; strained and strained and strained. After a few minutes I stopped and touched the bolt and darn near burned myself.

Invents a complex way of cooking a steak, but still cuts it with plastic cutlery... this guy sure likes challenges
I really dont want to hear you
Hears the song around one minute. Me: mark Rober.
Can the nick name be The Chicken Clapper 2.0
The meat beater 9001
i swear this was way to satisfying for me
wow you did it
Me 🤜🥩 is like the same mechanism as the meat beater
This feels Frankenstein adjacent, like you’re his younger, saner cousin or something, who wouldn’t raise the dead but isn’t past beating a corpse until it’s cooked - and I respect that
Me when the steak came out of the bag:  I know it doesn’t look good right now.. but watch this!!  Shoutout Guga Foods
So that what means beat the meat
Love the name meat beater by the way, I did something similar that every man can do.
*WE DID IT BOYS!*
u bent the definition of "cooked" to fit what you were able to achieve, thereby changing your goal line and NOT Cooking it!

U cant cook pizza by slapping it
Dave504 would be proud!
Meat-beaters of the world salute you!
Life would have been easier if I could just slap my chicken and it will be cooked
The first method of cooking
Congratulations ...   you did what unus annus couldn't do
Would be nice if you donated a few chickens to a homeless shelter.
i was there
Mongols would put meat underneath their saddle to achieve the same effect. pretty cool.

This man must have some dope summer barbecues after this
Thank you for teaching me. If I’m stuck out in the wild with a chicken and nothing else I will know how to cook it.
Tastes like it's been chewed already. Well, it was slapped about 100000 times
I mean, the similarities to Mark Rober are there but still interesting
Woah this is so cool this diserves a subscribe

@russianbadger
I didn’t know I needed to watch a man build a machine to beat his meat but I’m very satisfied
how far the humanity has come....
WTF HOW!?
Imagine if this was how cooking was invented
Bruh.. using Mark Robers music... Tsk
Idk why but the "Mark Rober music" absolutely killed me 😂
:0
I can relate to this after watching hent-
I KNEW IT WAS PETERS WORKSHOP I RECOGNIZED THE WINNEBAGO IN THE LAST VIDEO
I love that he's doing the mark Rober music like he's so smart for slapping the absolute hell of a chicken which he kind of is LOL
... The deed is done ...
A man ate an undercooked slap-cooked chicken, this is what happened to his organs.
Imagine in future this will be a way to cook some foods , like we have roasted , baked and slapped potatoes
This is so crazy i have to show that to my physics teacher
ok now cook it with *O N E S L A P*
So that's how they cooked before the discovery of fire.

This is really cool and but you wanted a medium - medium rare steak and you cooked it to 60C? Speaking from a chefs perspective your steak is in the upper end of medium, close to medium well.

Why yes, we are men of science. We do science things here.
Why didn’t you just make like 2 or 3 meat beaters and when one broke just move the chicken to the next and fix the one that broke while the chicken is in the other one
is that the rc sparks winnebago back there ?

I wanna see gordon ramsay do this or at least try the chicken
The chicken that died to be slapped: 😑
"If physical energy can be turn into thermal energy, how hard would I need to punch a chicken to cook it?"  Jello - 2019
The mark Roberg music 💯💯
Imagine living your whole life just to have your corpse slapped hundreds of thousands of times on the internet to entertain random humans
collab with guga foods to slap a 1500 dollar wagyu steak?
Bro mark rober looking a little different
Once a man asked "If phisical energy can be turned into thermal energy. How hard will I have to punch a chicken too cook it?"
The Rober vibes
Bro, quit breaking Peter’s stuff.
The measly kilogram controversly park because pike lovely excite atop a holistic greece. decisive, absorbed middle
The things you watch when you're supposed to be sleeping
You used mark robers song at 0:57
Gordon Ramsay better see this
So you can cook chicken by slapping it?      Video: Insulated as well
This is going to be the next mark rober
So here's the question? Why did you go with a linear reciprocating device instead of a rotary device with flexible slapper blades? While you energy per slap would be less the sheer volume of slaps would more than compensate for it.
Finally, one of the universes many mysteries solved.
should have just got davie504
When he is excited, he reminds me of “Doc!!!!!!!!! Doc!!!!!!!!!!!” - Marty McFly
I'm broke so i can relate to this
i remember  when we thought only superman could do this
I can hear Gordon Ramsay scream " ITS RAW ... YOU F*cking DONKEY!!"

But WHYYYYYYYY tho???
That Shit Ain't Cooked. Period.
Someone tell heavenly
I’ll have you know the true scientific temperature measurement is Kelvin.
Better to choke your chicken.  Lol
you stole peter Sripol's background
that shit ain't cooked
He was using the meat beater so I tried to be as fast as it and welp ITS VERY RED AND MY BALLS LOOK LIKE THEY ARE GETTING SWOLLEN
what's the background music called at 0:55?
👋
I need a meat beater.
this guy took "beating my meat" too literally...
Now you just have to do it again  *Manually*
Person: How do you cook your meat?  him: i beat my meat.
Everyone gangsta until the chickens fight back
I don't know but it seems so fake not gonna lie...🤣🤣
Give this to Peter Griffin
This Is the most beautiful video I've seen in a long time.
Ayy chicken slapping on trending pog!
B       E                                   Nothing
i guess this is where "beating your meat" came from...
Is nobody gonna talk about the Peter Stripol appearance, or did I just know know that he was there?
Now cook a chicken by choking it
Imagine losing your life and at least thinking, "At least I'll feed a family", and this is what your dead body goes through...
*you did what now*
Cooke bacon
9:22 JD??
mark rober would be proud
But why use wood
the return
Lies!!
Yo can u like make it simpler to understand science language cuz like ummm I
"Straps fleshlight to smack side"
World record meat beater, Congratulations❤
Straight up steals mark robers music
Presumably, the constant slapping tenderised the steak. That's why it was so soft.
*SOURCE: ADAM RAGUSEA*
Dis is geneyuise
Beat that meat!
Finally after all these streams I know watching all of them was worth it now
Having never heard of this channel, this video alone is worth subscribing
Just in time for Meat Beat Mania.

Lol
Great video idea quite interesting, but honestly it made me wanna go vegan. But regardless I enjoy the experiment.
Mark rober who?
We will definitely profit off this in 58 years
I bet he's a Mark Rober fan
Native americans watching this when they somehow got internet: *my life is a lie? Isn't it?*
bruh i thought i was watching a mark rober video
People should use this if they have no money
Polska musiała zostawić swój akcent przy tym osiągnięciu XDDD
dumny polak nakurwił jd na czacie XD 9:26
https://youtu.be/TCZcZVDR_4U
can we just appreciate that he beat his meat for 2 months straight
Wouldn't you be able to reduce wear on the machinery and energy cost if you moved the chicken to hit the board instead? thinking of a bumpy drum where the chicken gets whacked as it passes over it like in a washing machine or gem polisher.  Might need rollers instead of a board to reduce frictional damage to the bag.  I guess this design would be more like "how to roadkill and cook" though.  On the plus side, you could evenly tenderize the steak xD
I want some slap steak
If physical energy can be turned into thermal energy. How hard would i have to punch it to cook it.
All those chickens died just to get slapped a 1000 times by robots while being watched by 1.4 million people.

Actually... That chicken totally didn't looked cooked to me, but hey at least you kinda cooked it, i am proud of you.
You know it's about to get real when the mark rober music starts playng
"The original meat beater"   You mean the first man on earth?
just to point out im brittish and live in the uk we mesure heat in °c for a chicking to be safely cooked it has to be 75° but i go to 85° just wanted to put that out there
My parents are cooking chicken in the other room 😎👌
Somebody get Heavenly on the phone, he's gonna wanna know.
He finally found the meaning of life.
RussianBadger needs to see this
Thank you heavenly
This is how I will cook a chicken now
Girl: I bet he’s thinking about other women Him:
I can tell you get a lot of inspiration from Mark Rober, but the thing with you is that you aren’t copying while still making good content, so great job! :)
Ah yes, the Blowie-Matron
American ingenuity @ it'z finezt🤣🤣🤣👍🏽
where have i seen this one before?
This is Mark Rober's apprentice
2:15 Ha everyone is wrong, Kelvin is the real unit in science!
Tenderized and cooked
This guy is full of sh*t '''steak is cooked'''  it was so cooked he needed to go in the next room and swap it out.
Now this is how you science the shit out of something
what if your mom walked in and saw you beating your meat?
Now you gotta open a restaurant where you serve this.
So how many slap that can kill salmonella ?
@5:25 Ok, this might sound crazy but hear me out. You can just use a bearing.
Looks Like Hardly fake @ the end see ya Deabo
@Louis Weisz want to know why it keep failing? If you changed it so the arm that is doing the slapping has the equivalent of suspension on the front forks of a bike, it wouldn't pound the chicken so much, the way your doing it is creating too much friction and not enough kinetic energy, whereas if the front arm had "suspension" more energy would be transferred to the meat without pounding it to death. Also if you had at least 4 small fans pointing towards the bag from the sides, it may initially lose some heat, but when the kinetic energy is creating enough heat, the cold air from the fans would actually increase the temperature inside the bag cooking it quicker.
Gotta love the YouTube algorithm.
Who told you °C is scientific? In pysics and chemistry u normaly use K (Kelvin)
Just me or got Mark Rober vibes..
Did my guy have on mars yards?

Was that peter?
Now slap a bass
Dear. Fucking. God.
So you actually beated your meat on stream for hours
Don’t think we didn’t catch that Mark Rober music in the background... love it ❤️

All the chickens that sacrifice their lives for us to eat.. but a chicken and a cow arrive in this universe was slap cooked.. damn..
I wonder whats the next meat he’ll beat 😂

I hear that build montage music *Mark rober mumbling in the background*
I was hoping he says mmm it kinda slaps though.
What is that 69420 thing can someone explain?
Did this guy  really just say SALMON-ELLA 😂 Good job though
So limit is 7499 watt hours. Do not beat your meat with 7500 wat.
Now here’s a question, can you cook a chicken with the heat of an engine slapping a chicken?
The Meat Beater #14 on trending
It's finally been accomplished, this video should go down in human and YouTube History

Starving countries: *wondering wth Americans do with their food* The Americans:
The madlad actually fucking did it
This takes DIY to a whole new level.  I wonder what your efficiency was?  A single slap doesn't really impart that much energy to the chicken and it looks like you are using quite a bit of energy just to make a single slap.  I already commented on another video (not sure why this is a thing suddenly, but whatever) that it would take a mechanical arm to slap the chicken hard enough and fast enough to do any kind of meaningful work.
My god, what was the budget for this series?
Next video: how long would you have to stare at a steak to wish it into cooking itself?
all you really have to do to cook a chicken is keep it like that but when you get to 60 degrees you could lower the wattage intake and you could make it so that it does not slap the chicken fully
I wish it was my bare ass on instead of the chicken
that mark rober backround music really hits the spot
That chicken wasn’t cooked
If you can cook a chicken by slapping it then why isn't my wife cooked?
So you can cook a chicken like this but are you acutely a good chef?
The backround music is the same as mark rober and you kinda sound like him and you talk about science kinda stuff too XD
Isnt it kelven that real brain ninjas measure heat in?
This reminds me of Mark Robber it’s just the music.....
im getting mark robber vibes
It's the fact this is number 12 on tending

Oh shit hes actually on real trending
Ayy man, thats no chicken.
Cook your thanksgiving turkey with the meat beater 9001. I dare you.
Did u really not use any bearings?
The mad lad finally did it. Congratulations. Now, how long would you have to swing a chicken around at high speeds to get it to cook? In other words: You did the slap, but can you do the sling? Because you know.....friction generates heat and air molecules are no exception to that....
The man's got a rice cooker........ Noice
0:56 you know its serious when the mark rober music kicks in
3:55 Didn’t realize your neighbors had a drag car.  What kinda motor they running to produce that sound, man?  V8, V10, Meat Beater V2?

This dude missed the point of the thought experiment  The idea is to cook it in ONE slap

My mom can cook the chicken with 1 slap
This is amusing but for some reason I feel bad for the chicken.

hear me out, use electromagnetic coils like on a tattoo machine except 10x the size, a armature bar and contact point like on a tattoo machine and armature bar to slap the chicken, then you can vary speed, force

You need a slap
Love the mark rober music l

"we gonna use celsius" >Still tells the temperature in F bruh.
when you smoke meat, you hold it at a lower cooking temperature to preserve tenderness while achieving food safety. you smoked a chicken by slapping it
The music at 1:40      Anyone else remember Mark Rober's music?
You cooked something by tenderizing the damn thing.
I have hello fresh and its actual garbage lol. Marley spoon is way better. The recipes take longer but are way way better.
bet all the vegans disliked

if i can convert physical energy to thermal energy, how many slaps to cook a chicken? *an old russian badger stream*

Nope not for me Using furnace so much easier😅
Mark rober v2???
Good job on finally getting there, but why not use an air hammer to begin with?  Short stroke, powerful, and very fast. 4500 bpm would have cooked that steak in 10-15 minutes.
i can't imagine how tender it is
Thought i was watching Mark Rober’s sons’ vids
I really live in a timeline where people are bored enough to cook a chicken by SLAPPING IT!

I feel like the steak was more important then the chicken
my mind is blown.
asian parents be like: pathetic.
This is some god-tier content
Where did he found a plastic knife that can actually cut. Specially a brick steak like that!
You should’ve seasoned and garnished it...
Yo can I see that chicken pasteurization chart though. For reasons
He built a machine to beat his meat for him. Next, he should build a machine to beat his meat for him.
Well well, animal abuse to the extreme.
He is an off brand Mark Rober XD
I feel like I just watched a Mark Rober video
Unas and Annus would be proud
Mark rober music mark rober music
You forgot to season the chicken. Salt and pepper is a must.
This has got to be a kink...
Even when i turned off my phone i could still hear the slapping from my parents bedroom...
This has to be the dumbest video I’ve actually learned something from 😂
You will be remembered in history. Put in all the ingredients of cooking a chicken and slap it next time.
Now that's some real dedication.
You have to much time on your hands........
I've never slapped like harder.... 👏
👑👑 king.
They said it couldn't be done

Chicken abuse xd
I can sleep tonight...
9:20 jebac disa, pozdrawiam
I am, a fairly educated man. Grown, well read, well traveled and fully enjoyed the content of this video. I am, by trade an engineer, and while I understood the concept, and the execution. I couldn't get out of my head the simple fact, that you have forever redefined the term spanking the monkey to slapping the chicken / smacking the beef. Thereby proving, no matter how serious I try to think about this, as a grown man, I can't quit laughing like a 14 year old boy. Thanks for this, truly. If I'm the only one that's made this leap, well, I'm moritifed yet, it is, what it is.

Imagine being that chicken. Killed for eating purpose then beaten over 15000 times for ughhh i guess science?? What a life tho
He sounds like Chris and jimmy
This better be in the history books of future generations. This is brilliant! Congratulations!
He missed the perfect time to say this steak... actually... slaps!!!

It's beautiful.

The world may love the metric system but changing your temperature measurement to be on the scale of boiling and freezing water in the name of "real science" is misguided ignorance at best. While Fahrenheit isn't metric it has more degrees of change so its more accurate to the temperature without counting past a decimal.
EXCUSE THE *ACTUAL* HELL OUTTA ME. I woke up an hour ago and the moment I check youtube this is what I see. MY MAN. YOU, ARE, A, LEGEND!
Type F to pay respect to all of the slappers that got damaged
Mambo
Now all you need to do is bake a cake with slaps
Meat beater 😳
We truly live in the greatest age of scientific discovery in human history
you passed up a perfectly good opportunity when tasting the steak to say... "It slaps."
boys after hitting puberty:
This man just spent what a macdonald's worker is paid for a year, on slapping frozen chicken,                        yeah idk about you but i would say thats money well spent
Oh my jeeba leebaaa truly a madlad
Hey Louis! I'm the physics major who did the original calculations that started the chicken slap meme. Super impressed that you actually pulled it off! I had been following along with your previous attempts because so many people sent your videos to me! Awesome video, keep up the good work!

Just ask Mark Rober
After you slapped your chicken I hope you didn't choke it also  lol
He’s like Mark Rober, he uses the same music Mark does, and he is an Enginner (I think)
That why i hate typical polish people 9:21 congrats for saying "jebać disa" cuz of that he can be demonetised cos of cursed words in video
I remember watching the first video
idk why but the steak part for me was really sus. during the slapping thing with the steak you switched the bag with a different so I thought that you replaced the raw steak with a cooked one lol.
Finally, the views you deserve.
Holy fuckin shit
I subscribed to this guy to see cool constructions and ideas, yet he's been cooking a chicken by slapping it for months. I'm both fascinated and disappointed
This is a journey that merits novelization, seriously 😂
kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
U should add some Spring or someting on slaper
100 yrs later. He will show up in the science books
"The Original Meat Beater" the only video on YT that can use that line and not get demonetized.
Now I see why everyone wants to come to America we get to do some dumb ass things🤣
You could just throw the chicken in the oven
John 3:16-17 16. For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 23. For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9. That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen!

Meat beater 9000 do you mean my hand
1:15 I get mark vibes hearing the music
I've been taught all my life if theres blood send it back but I'm not gana judge
This is the worst setup for a slapper arm ever. All you needed was a wheel with soft spatula like protusions that literally slapped into the chicken at RPMs that would increase the heat of it for the sheer ridiculousness of the amount of impacts (it would actually burn the chicken at the impact site). Cooking augers do exist. They were tested by militaries to use agitation which is as simple as hooking it up to mechanical power to cook MREs.
Beat that meat
Hey I made it into the video 9:18  Glad I got to see history in the making

Finally, he has achieved beating the meat
this man literally just living in peter sripols garage
Why would anyone ever use wood for any of this except to draw it out for views. Lmao
The prophecy was true
is it just me or.... 1:55 - 1:56
Damn dude that's insane  BTW I tested hello fresh a while ago and I really recommend it, like it's really fun to prepare the meals and they're just so good
This takes the concept of strokin- I mean slapping the chicken 🐔😌.
This man is the true scientist.
4:35 Guys please tell me, whats the name of this song in the background?
By god the mad lad did it
“The original meat beater...” lol
Do it with a live one.
Pov: you got this recommended
I love the mark rober music lol
Konosuba fans: 9:30
I might be a sociopath, but I just wanna put my enemies at the end of the slap machine
THE MADLAD DID IT
Here's an idea to rev up that steak recipe: Put some pineapple juice in the bag before you slap it. Then the texture will be... really something (liquid steak)
“meat beater” 😑
okay now find out if you can cook a steak by screaming
alternate title - The 'come' back of the meat beater 9000
Am i the only one that gets Mark Rober vibes watching this video
Been here before 10k soo proud to you see how much you've grown...

New question how many slaps does it take to cause a fire

Next time, don’t use plastic utensils
A L U M I N U M

Shoulda just made bacon
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates🔻

Himym would be way more interesting if marshall had this machine during the slap bet.
Yeah science!
@Davie504 approved technique. Epico!
That is what i call dedication lol

Glad to know you have actually pulled it off, unlike the last time.

Not fake at all.
So by this point Batman might as well be a oven? Edit: Also wait you named it the meatbeater xD
"What hath God wrought?"
I'm I wrong or is Kelvin the real scientific way to measure temperature ?
You should do a collab with Mark Rober
We didn't have microwaves in stone age. People in stone age: **slap** **slap** **slap** **slap** **slap**

How to complete a project:  Use mark rober music
That machine reminds me of my ex
Louis:  I actually cooked a chicken with slaps Also Louis: This steak is perfectly cooked
Would choking work as well?
People before fire was invented:
Aaaahhhh it's the end Or is it?
My guy could actually make a car too that’s powered by chicken slaps and once your done using the chicken slap car to charge it you have to make a meat slapper and slap the chicken until morning
I love that type of videos Taking a meme seriously and actually making it work
Chigen
Hi
deserved comment
Continuing the legacy of unus annus I see
I bet that chicken SLAPS
What about if you dont slap the chicken but use the chicken as a slepper
Years from now, when my children ask me what I did in quarantine; I'll smile because I was there for the slap seen around the net
F
We don't need no chefs anymore.
Legendary. Patent and sell this on shark tank
As someone who is always clenching my jaw I kind of want that steak

4:46 Hell yea  VINEGAR LEG IS ON THE RIGHT
This is giving me Mark Rober vibes... probably the music
You know it's going to be amazing when you hear Steve moulds background music
It seemed to be a long time when the first video came out.
Take a video about this , at least something in your life will do global satanic elite it consists of around 10,000 people , from well-known Merkel , Sarkozy, bill gates , Zuckerberg , Sergey Bryl and Larry page , the Bush family, the Clintons , Rockefellers , Rothschild, Baruch,Leiba, Morgan, Carnegie , almost all Royal and Imperial families from around the world and many other names .They are behind the world wars, they created and spread the coronavirus, the main goal is to ensure the arrival of the Antichrist and prevent the second coming of Jesus and the last judgment , such conditions are allowed by God, because before destroying Lucifer (iblis),because he disobeyed God and did not worship Adam , he asked not to kill him, to leave him alive, and for this he will experience the creation of God - man in particular and humanity in general, Lucifer(iblis) . For mankind there are 3 options for the outcome of the first coming of Antichrist and the fall spirit that it has not been rewarded with the 2nd coming of Jesus and then judgment will not, and will all be erased in the dust , except for the approximate 190.000 people who helped the devil to defeat the mankind and the Second variant of the Human spirit on a global scale will be such strong that will not work with them to bring the Antichrist , and will have 2 coming of Jesus and then there will be judgment . Well, the last option they will achieve the coming of the Antichrist , but humanity in general will fight for itself and God will let down Jesus and we will win and there will be a last judgment .They are fighting for eternal life for themselves, and for us they want to leave the option that we will all be wiped out and not even bother with the last judgment . The outcome depends on each of you , and your life after death .This is the information you need to know why Satanic is actually doing all this .And our task is to stop them . And let me remind you that the world is developed by industrialists , scientists , farmers , teachers, well, no matter how satanists, they have always slowed down industrial progress
Change the name into the meatbeat-inator

hi butt whole
Woah,  i watched the last video a long time ago,  Glad u finally did it 👍
We finally did it boys, the next generation of cooking is apon us
Man, seriusly, STOP using wood. Wood suck, you are not trying to build a farmhouse
Why do I feel like you took Kyle Hill saying you can't do this as a personal challenge, which seeing as you "technically" succeeded I say Good Job!  sub-note: I only say "technically" as I am a person who likes well done steak, ie: cooked till grey inside, & most importantly that the cooking table says so. I also now know about this "sous vide" method for cooking food since I followed the info source links so thanks o/
No one gonna talk about how HPC (hydraulic press channel) watches them!?
Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed the video but by using this background music in this video format it feel like you're straight up trying to make a copy of Mark Rober's videos. You don't need that. This content is already good, now just add your own style instead of using someone else's.
He beat the crud out of that cockle.
You should see how long you can withstand being spanked by your meat beater.
Why do I feel like he is mark rober 2.0
my guy using paint for the blueprint
Reminds me of the unus annus vid
damn he actually succeeded
I mean in real science we use the Kelvin scale to quantify temperatures but I'm already happy you didn't switch to matchhead ignitions per ounce of water or something
He beat that meat
I can slap a chicken.
*Stop beating your meat.*
Kelvin is used for real science not Celsius or that stupid F :D
9:21 polish accent on chat
When your parents check on you at night: "Mom, get out! I'm beating my meat!" Dad: "Ah, that's real and delicious science, son!"
Girls when they try the meat beater 9001: *faster,  faster*
Out the slapped down the crapper
Guinness Book of Records for most beats on a "cockle".
THIS MANZ GOT THE MARK MUSIC
This gave me mark Rober vibes.....also....I attended both the live stream of chicken getting slapped
Oh my God he's done it oh my God he's evolving
Grouse wants to *KNOW YOUR LOCATION*
13 minutes 16 seconds of a guy engineering a machine to beat his meat
Completely another level of meat beating
If you get over the bad taste, it tastes pretty good!
Kid: mom can we get chicken Mom: we have chicken at home Chicken at home:
How many chokes to take to cook a chicken next please 😂
I watched the livestream of the steak and chicken test, and I am glad that it finally worked! Congratulations on this major event in history!
Yeah, with the steak, I realized that you're basically tenderizing it as you cook it, so it will be the opposite of tough XD
So whats the point of cooking chicken by slapping ? Will it change the world in any way ? Instead of this shit they should focus on real shit going on in the world like myanmar military coup india farmers protest and many more plus the music is from mark rober  videos why always taking things from someone else be real do shits your own way cause this gives me mark rober vibe I wish to watch different youtuber but this days all youtubers sounds the same vibes the same and shit the same content
I love how he made it like a mark rober video at the start even the music.   but he's slapping a chicken 🐔 😂
Jokes on you gordon haha!
You deserve the views man. That’s incredible
Hmmmm.
That aerogel bag looks amazing, how do I get one?
You can say the food slaps cx
I can't believe I watched a video about a dude who beats his meat.
Start of the video with my reaction: wOw nO waY whAt-?!  Normal people’s reaction to the start of the video: ✨🄽🄾🅃🄷🄸🄽🄶✨
bro this a waste of time and a waste of food .
Word of the day: Pulpification
Copy of Balian
Anyone come here after watching Russianbadger
Best video of 2021
the mark rober music got me into it
Oh hell yeah
I really want someone to put all these clips together and make an epic movie trailer for the meat beater 9001
Meat slapper that sounds weird
I'm still sad you didn't make chicken plate armor.  But what an awesome follow up to an incredible first video!  So satisfying to see that cooked steak...
Casually ripping Mark Rober’s brand with that background music.  Respect.
That's clickbait.
A couple of issues. First, you only slapped the chicken to 140 degrees fahrenheit which is 25 degrees short of being safe to eat. Second, that chicken was sitting in the temperature danger zone which is 41-140 degrees fahrenheit for more than 4 hours which means it is unsafe for human consumption. Any chicken has to cross this zone in 4 hours or less to be considered safe for human consumption. I like the ingenuity but this is beyond disgusting and hope you don’t get food poisoning.
Can you next find out what happens if we slap Piers Morgan 135000 times?
Power it with a 20 hp gas engine or something
Netflix: are you still watching Someone daughter:

Anyone else notice that he used the same music as Mark Rober when explaining his ideas...I think it is smart boi music.
I will now use "slapping my chicken" as a new term. Thank
Mark called me, he want his music back.
You could say he was beating the meat :)
Seeing the steak popped me
Next month on the news: "Man beats meat vigorously for over 69,420 strokes. Find out how it tastes here at 11."
This man did what unus annus could never

Bring mark rober in if your famous enough
I love science now
Congratulations👏
This is going to be a part of history.... O7

Im happy this happened, aight now gimme likes

Thank the lord that this guy isn't tasked with making weapons or something used against people. Like, can you imagine what he would come up with? Imagine if this thing was used against a torture victim's ass or something!
That friend who takes a joke too far.
"Starts talking about sponsor" Well of course cooking is nice and all and the food is delicious but wHEre'S tHe fuN IN tHaT?
Gordon ramsey better see this and say that it is raw
Use a cushion on the other end of the rod to create variable pressure without adjustment
I’m not mad just disappointed that you used a technicality to reduce the temp you needed to achieve for your “goal” cmon, no one considers that “cooked” get it to 165
“The meat beater 9001” why did this make me laugh?
gordon ramsey would be proud
Cook a steak now
Hmmm so weird that youtube recommended me this video so early.   I mean it's not even a year
Well congrats
Mark rober 2.0
Your not the only person that has made chicken slapper. Many other YouTuber's have made it.
I need this machine but with a male stroker attached to the end.
Finally  The quest is complete
You just wasted your time FOR JUST SLAPPING A CHICKEN FOR A LONG TIME
The oafish interactive quickly accept because alarm externally plan forenenst a uttermost thrill. limping, outgoing push
Disappointed
9:21 Jebać Disa Greetings from Poland
Its like poop
THIS ABSOLUTE MADLAD ACTUALLY DID IT HOLY SHIT
This is a Michael Reeves project. Just less tasers
The restaurant industry has changed forever
Are you Josh Ritter's son?
Now theoretically, if we were to slap at that condition that many times, would our hands be cooked too?
I wanna see what happens if you put your head where the chicken is
Davie504 would be proud
Mom: What did you do today?  Me: I watched a dude slap some meat.  Mom: Ummm.....
y are u in Peter's place???!?
Imagine trying to cook a chicken,but all of your equipment cooks first.
This is beating your meat to the next level
Did you just stole the Musik from Mark robber? 🤔Alright go ahead😂
I wonder what the vegan teacher would think of this

Not a Single Soul: Random Person: "Beat me like you beat that chicken~"
the only food Davie504 can eat
I've heard of choking the chicken by slapping it but never heard you can cook one that way.
Is this still a thing lol
01:11 mark rober vibes from music
hide it before they slap something else with it 😳
i think this guy must be my upstairs neighbor
Salmonella says high
Here's a thought--use of very small strokes at very high frequency could deliver the required energy to the chicken.  Shorter strokes might also prevent damage to chicken tissues.  Adding insulating foam plastic walls around the chicken may help reduce heat loss to ambient temperature.
MARK ROBER JR.!!?!?
Davie504 should be told about this video, but then again he already knows the power of slap.
Imagine working so hard and having so many technical tools around, but not having a metal tray or bucket (items that can be found in any workshop) nearby.  Yeah, sure, you definitely didn't swap the chicken in the bag with a cooked one when you went out of the room
When you want to comment something witty...
I happy I got recommended part 2
Gordon Ramsey looks upon you with disgust
Another great step for Human science.
2 days later in the news: Local youtube dies from salmonella after eating uncooked food.
hahahaha
Vegans watching this video be like: **👁👄👁**
Hmmmmmmmmm someone used the Mark Rober song
this is perhaps the most incredible scientific achievement this year
Just don't let Gordon Ramsay see this
The chicken and the cow in heaven must have been like : what the hell is this guy doing to me
Me when I say something my parents don’t like: 2:34
All this time I have been choking mine.....my way makes it’s own gravy.
Love the Blowiematron reference! :)
this is amazing

Should have used a paddle wheel design.
mark rober song 1:20 XD
That has to be the most tender meat in the entire world.
The slapper did beat the meat out of it.
Getting Mark Robber vibe from him. Same music and way of speaking
1:05 if I know u know
10:13 looks raw
This video has ruined my love-life.
UNUS ANNUS UNUS ANNUS
Animals were harmed during the production of this video.
You can gather people to slap that chicken, you will get the result and world record
no ive never seen the orginal vid but i dont like that u called a meat beater
A blowiematron? LTT viewer I see.
It tastes like you've been chewing it already LOL
Who considered, for a second, creating a slapper to Cook chicken?
"Wai-Wai-wait... If kinetic energy goes to thermal energy... How Hard do I have to punch a chicken to cook it?"
2 months later....wtf
The steak is so fucking fake lmao
Poor chickens giving its life up to be slapped rest easy king 🐓
BEAT THE MEAT
Sad to report that soon after making this video Louis died from slapmonella poisoning.
Bruh did the video thumbnail just called out my name???
I need a meat beater 9000 in my life
NO, I REFUSE, THIS IS NOT OVER UNTIL YOU TAKE A BITE.
You deserve every award in the world

This is the funniest video I've ever seen and also it's 13 on trending which makes it even better
Unnas annus
Also used the mark rober explaining music to get the 'mark rober vibes'
1.1M views.  The largest circle beat of a single piece of meat I've ever seen.
Waiter:what cook do you want on you chicken? Me:i want it slapped with the finest slapper you have
Davie504 is proud of you
I’ll buy this what price
I'm sad for the failed tries where you just wasted chicken
Ofcourse the steak is like chewinggum you have literally slapped it with a metal piece for about an hour
FOR SCIENCE
junier mark rober
Mark Rober would be proud.
the best knock-off mark rober in history
Why does it start at 27c the third time and 8c the first time?
"What's your meat beating level?" "My meat beater is OVER 9000!!!!!" I doubt i'm the only person who made this joke
I skipped to the end and thought the steak was chicken
Peter is pretty smart
Chicken: “How can she slap!!?”
9:21... If you know  *You know*
Hey, not an engineer here, seemed like a good place to ask a question that's always bothered me.  Why/how do you guys know how to build crazy stuff like this or mythbusters kind of tom foolery. Sure, I get physics, math and such, but where exactly do you guys learn to go "Guess I'll buy some this and that, some scrap metal, Ta da here's a heavy machine"?  Thanks a lot
Meanwhile that chicken   AHHH HIT ME HARDER AHHH  Feels like a food p0✓n
The madlad actually did it
The meatbeater lmao
budget mark rober
Beatin' the meatin' .
Slap like now
I prefer why meat well-done because I'm Asian.
Your project is Davie504 approved
Just remember this thing started because of a curious redditor
So if you're ever stranded in the wilderness and manage to snag a chicken.... Just slap the shit out of it for like 3 days straight. Even if it doesn't cook the chicken,  the look on your face should be enough to scare away predators
Beat that meat
Technically it's a poultry beater not a meat beater
Yay slap chickens
You know it's serious when you hear Mark Rober music
“How to cook chicken”  Google: *reasonable answer*  Bing:
When does the restaurant open
9:25 JEBAĆ disa xddd
man this video slaps
Its funny that I've still beaten my meat more than this robot.
reminds me of the one of dumbest unus annus videos :' )
Hr said he cooked it, he didnt say anything about the taste. Taste is subjective.
Louis Weisz, aka the next Mark Rober
Thank you YouTube algorithm
wtf
what's the music that starts at 7:47?
Plot twist the steak was a paid actor
A meal through slaps? Nah im good my gf is enough
When a slapper is a better chef than you
Now I can die in peace.
Plot twist he put med rare steak cuz he was so tired
Imagine this chicken watching this from heaven like the first one.

No machine can ever beat my dad in a slapping contest.
Oh God he used the mark rober music

YOU ARE A MAD MAN!
nice music XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
Man's just copying Mark Rober style videos. Sad.
Ur like a mix of peter sripol and mark rober! Love your videos!
You could save energy if you put a live chicken in the slapper, the internal temperature of the meat would be higher, and the slapper would do double duty at killing the chicken.
This guy dedication is a real deal
Friend: Damn the oven is broken  Louis: Hang on I'm gonna get my chicken slapper
"boss, the chicken guy is back..."

This is just science mumbo jumbo

This man has spent more time planning chicken slaps than most of knew was possible.
Did he go to the toilet to change the meat?
Taking beating his meat to new levels
Oh my god he actually did it

I've seen this video on the Brazilian yt
Him "it tastes like you've been chewing the steak for like a minute" Me "well you see that's because you were slapping it for like 30 minutes to an hour so of course It is going to be chewy"
Did anyone suggest a waterwheel-style multiple slapper? Almost like the brushes in a car wash. Still, interesting concept.
i will tell my kids you are one of the people in the math problems
This guy is a genius
Congratulations! Now send this to NASA.
and they said it could never be done...
6:15 should have used a chevy 350 small block
He gave up huh 😒
You deserve all this growth you’ve worked really hard for it
*M E A T B E A T E R*
POG WE DID IT
2:19 hey that's me 🤣 lol i was trying to be funny and he actually changed to celsius
so technically flash could literally cook something
04:25 Its not just accepting defeat, it is also accepting salmonella
Someone finally answered Jello's question            If ya'll get the joke then leave a like if you want
Imagine needing the meat beater 9001 when you can have asian parents slap the chicken instead
MB 9001? Where can I get one my hands are tired.
You sound like Mark Rober.
the mini mark rober
Hhahha using Celsius
Today's my first day off in a while. I was going to use this time to buy groceries, get a haircut, get a car wash and clean up around the house...
Can we talk about that the sponsor segue was good?
This is a more important experiment than would first appear
Celsius for real science? I think you mean Kelvin.
I was here when history was written
Jello we found the answer. This is how hard we need to punch a chicken to cook it.
If you choke the chicken you finish a lot faster
Omg, I wrote my science final on this! And my math worked!!!!
The productive cupcake disturbingly stir because open splenomegaly occur near a hissing lizard. dull, nappy balinese

I wonder if goat would have been better since that's a tougher meat.
Title: chicken Reallity: steak
Nobody:    That One Guy in Chat: ''Try an Oven Bud''
YOU MAD LAD
he sounds like mark rober saying all the sciencey stuf
Bro you stole this idea
“Original meat beater”
HE DID IT, HE FUCKING DID IT, HOW
9:24 nice to see some polish accent edit: look at the chat. Only polish people will know
Someone give this man an award  Maybe guinness?  Hey guinness book of world records maybe you'll notice this
_Chicken: please no Louis please I have a family_ Louis: HAHA CHICKEN GO SLAP
All the Unus annus fans: 🍽️🥲
he hast returned
You made the most inefficient oven on earth
Slapstick Steak.... Still fucking raw!!!
Let's all appreciate that this has no ads.
That shit is raw
HE DID IT IT TOOK A LONG ASS TIME BUT HE DID IT HE REALLY DID
1:55 Thought that white stuff was something else for a sec lmao
Uhhhhhh....congratulations?
i just heard  meat beater
Hello Fresh is the appropriate sponsor of this video lol
10:48 Indians: "I felt that"
Did you get slapped and thought of doing this? 😅
Congratulations! Hahaha you made it
How to slap a chicken be like XD
buget mark rober
*Beating Meat: Literally*
Good video Mark rober 😂😂
9:21 JD
extremely homosexual
This might be a new cooking discovery, like i imagine in the future simpler gadgets like this will be actually a thing.         Or im just crazy
Yo just add seasoning
You have just beaten the meat well done👍😂😂
You absolute madlad
Man has evolved yet agian
Saw the first one and was sad you didn’t achieve the goal but I’m glad to see this in my recommended.
He finally solved my math problem that I needed
Amazing!      You did it you profesional idiot!
This video is fully Davie504 approved 😂✅
Imagine an animal activist watching this video

Is he at Peter sripol shop
Man you're like the next Mark Rober.
You to the chicken: I like ya cut g HARD
Screw the flying cars, this is more interesting.

"Beat Meater 9001"  You stole the name of my right hand!
I mean I get it but honour the dead
Bruhhh u still do it for content like bruh...
history
Mark rober vibes
Wait- sounds familia-
you forgot the peper
My mom still hits harder
This just gets better, the meatbeater 9000🤣🤣🤣🤣
Did he seasoned it?
My wife as a chef after seeing that chicken: *disgust Ramsay's face
That’s a 500$ chicken diner
**This guy when he finds out someone boils water by shaking it**  Our battle will be legendary
I think there is a factor that hasn't been taken into account if it is being equated to a human slapping a chicken cooked. That being the temperature and stiffness of the slapper, as the body has an ambient temperature and it will increase while slapping both from the impact but also through the exertion.  A possible solution could be to use a water cooling system that sends the hot water from the motor to the cutting board then wrapping the board in pig skin to better approximate the temperature and texture of a hand.
The original meat beater🤣🤣😅
*We made it into the history books people*
Aerogel scientists: *create wonder material for innovative scientific application* Louis: *uses aerogel for slapping chickens*
Davie504 can cook that chicken with one slap
But....flamethrower ;-;
9:25 jd 🥲🥲
"They called him a Madman"
"The meat beater 9001" ohh boy
TRUE SCIENCE IS FINALLY BACK
Your restaurant is going to be booked for months! Meat Beater, and Spanked Chicken are already adult theaters, so you'll have to think up another name.
this means sr pelo was right when he cooked people with his slaps
Freedom units
Sad that u didnt try again to also taste the chicken..for such a dang good video, this was kinda disapointing
Where the F is Guinness World Record!? Give this man a medal and a cooked chicken!!!
You got to publish a paper for this invention man... For the memes!!
pozdro dla gościa który spamił JD na czacie
Gordon ramsay: slapping you're meat again ay...
the science of beating the meat.  an indirect approach might be more promising, like heating an amount of water mechanically and sous vide the chicken in that water. that would also keep the integrity of the chicken. I imagine two rotors spinning in oposit directions next to each other, or a plunger plunging the water.
Dude is literally alternate reality mark rober. The music, the speech pattern, the science, the voice. Uncanny
Man he cooked the stake by slapping it better than I can cook a stake when I try my best... 😭
Drugs are BAD , stupid people are Dangerous .
Professional 🤜 🥩
Damn that last video was 2 months ago it felt like it was a year ago
Ohhhhh watch till the end... the chicken so hot, resurrecte... so hot!!! 😳
That's science . Try and try .
Or you know you can just cook it in the oven...
@Davie504
You still didn’t eat a fully cooked chicken so until now, u still didn’t win
Steak, more like chop
OK jokes aside this could be revolutionary
Sponge Bob : ‘’One Hundred Years Later’’
How tf do u over cook a steak with no flame
The great journey has come to an end
Next up: Collect fart from 1 million people to make a nuclear bomb.
Only Davie 504 doesn't need this machine to cook the chicken
now THIS is a giant leap for mankind
Celsius isn’t as accurate as Fahrenheit.
heavenly is that you?
I’ll be back in 10 year probably when it is recommended to me
Nope; don’t eat that shit. 165 stop quitting and hit the 165
Honestly it's slapped
davie504 watching this:.......hmph rookies
1:53 chat JEST DOBRZE
THE MAD LAD FINALLY DID IT
IT TASTES LIKE STEAK LETSSS GOOOOOOOOOOOOO   that would be hilarious without context
Lol you just jumped 120k subs to 300k subs
Fortunately i got samonella
THE ABSOLUTE MADLAD
Davie504: Did I hear SLAP?
Wait a damn minute, I'd notice that background music for anywhere ITS MARK ROBER'S
This guy will be on an infomercial in like a year and say “introducing the slap cooker”
This video has major Mark Rover vibes
So you could say you can claim the steak on that one eh?
lets get Davie504 to see this
Why didn't you put in a box? The slapping would provide heat, but the meat wouldn't be fuckin smashed.
Someone get Jello.
9:21 Hail to mielonka mielona!
1:51-1:56: Discord mod when they meet e-girls
I wanted more than anything to eat a meal cooked by the power of slaps. -Louis, 2021
Fahrenheit is for losers who haven't gotten with this century yet. Pretty much the entire world uses metric because it's better in every way.
Well the SPAGHET horror game is happy
... did you cook a chicken and steak came out? Am I missing something?
hmmmm seems like a Mark Robber.... WHAT A FRICKING GENIUS ( CLAP IT UP NICE JOB)
Ever bitchslapped someone that hard you cooked his cheek?
This whole concept was a joke in a Russianbadger video. I hate the fact that this is an actual way to cook chicken..
Alternate dimension where humans didn't discovered fire.
Finally something important
Oh for crying out loud, just build a fire.
Way to swap out the steak when you walked out of the room! Hahaha
The scale uaed for science is Kelvins, but Celsius is good start Also it looks like baloon caused rig to break at 7:30
Like a green house?
1:04 "The orginal meat beater" 😏
Why would you slap your meat to be cooked when you can cooked your meat using flame
The chicken was a bad boy it needed spankings
Humanity has peaked, and Im damn proud of our summit.
nice
leaked footage of a home alone teen
WELL I guess you can say that slaps
SOB did it!!!
The steak look abit to raw but that fine
The Hacksmith  actually cooked a chicken with his rocket slap machine with only one slap
*Meat Beater*
When you want a business for slapping spoiled kids The Slapping Machine: 😆
Youtube... From all the videos you could have recommended me this was the one
Why don't you try to create multiple machines so you can change machine when it breaks or just to don't overheat it
Imagine slapping the chicken without a slapping machine O_O Ohhh boiiii
Why the chicken is looking like poop 💩
what the heck 1mil views in 19hours
whats next? i cooked a chicken by breathing fire?
My mom could just slap the chicken once and boom, its cooked. her slaps are hard asf ;-;
The chicken company’s: Take that down TAKE THAT DOWN
So you can cook a person during a fight
I assume this idea was from Unus Annus
Nice shoutout to LTT's blowiematron there
When I was watching this my mom came in my room and ask what am I watching and I said "some dude make a machine to slap a chicken" and she looked at me weirdly
Giving a new meaning to "beating your meat"
can I cook the food from hello fresh by slapping?
Try slapping your butt a hundred thousand with that slapper to see if it will be cooked ಡ ͜ ʖ ಡ
hey why dint u just put a heating coil at the end of the slapper XD
this is great, but it probably was very hard to succeed because your machines hand does not have the heat of a human hand, which probably makes it easier
So this dude took 2 months to slap a chicken? At least he is not an engineer responsible for some of the structures people use everyday.
Why do you sound so much like Jerry Seinfeld
can you cook your chicken by choking it??
Chicken: Why you bullying my body
If you need Help with slapping, just ask Davie504
Davie504 should see this 😂
I to jd na czacie w 9:21 XD
And this kids is why you don't just use aluminum. The SN curve for aluminum tends to 0. It means that it will be weakened by fatigue no matter how soft the force you apply, it is a matter of time. Steel, however, has fatigue limit which means it can keep going forever as long you don't exceed that limit.
I got that Winnebago in mint cond lol
Certified Jello moment
what about a double action slapper with the motor further from the fulcrum?
So when we survive a plane fall and land on an island without any equitment....we can choose to cook our meal with non stop slap it.
Jebać disa XDDD
The meat beater 9002 comes with a flesh light attachment
So we just gona skip over the fact that he called it the "meat beater 9000" 🤣🤣🤣🤣 my friend was passing heard the name and was like damn there's a machine for it now 🤣🤣🤣 context is everything
Leaving a comment to prove I was alive to see this
*Next level torture*
I really appreciate how hard you took to work this
Oh my, science really _has_ gone too far. And I am all for it.
This is the future of cooking..
he did it
You should use spank method
Did u even season the steak and chicken???
U look like charlie chaplin 😲

Searching for Davie504's comment
Amagine being that chicken and knowing you been coocked by slaps 😂
Imagine if this is how they cook chicken in the future, instachicken you just put it in your slapper for 5 minutes and you can eat. I'ma be a entrepreneur.
It's raw
Anyone else recognize the mark rober music in the background?
Its like my chicken           *and not the eatable kind*

you don't even have to slap it, just get a sword with fire aspect and kill a living chicken, then boom, easiest way to cook chickys
Legends say that he got salmonella a week later
Slappers.
This video slaps!       This is such a bad attempt...
I am really sceptical but it looks kinda cool
Anyone noticed that this channel is exactly like mark rober?
Meat beater . . . R we all ok with this 😳
i'm so thankful that you use Cesius instead of Farts/cubic inch
Here before it gets recommended to everyone
Hey wanna watch Chicken getting cooked by Slapping it  Me: YES
Mental chicken abuse
WHO MADE THIS CHICKEN ?!?!!??
F
Everybody gansta until someone does this during CBT
They could call it the slap master, meat stomper, Salmonella sanitizer,  or my personal favorite the break everything machine.
I feel like if the internet were invented sooner we would have a really similar video of a maniac blasting a chicken with a magnetron and inventing the microwave. What I'm really saying is; I look forward to buying a second-hand countertop food-slapper oven.
This is so dumb
*_Davey504 Approves_*
it hurts to see him not sear the steak
Make a bigger one for humans!. they are so stupid that even ask for slaps.

@gugafoods pls

U made it :D
He did it. The madman actually did it.
I hope this part of the interned, made up of bullshit experiments like this and nonsense, will eventually die out one day
The chicken must be sooooo tender
Restaurants in 2070 : Garlic slapped chicken 🤣
Davie504 needs to see this

The madman has finally done it
Am I the only one that see’s that Fahrenheit is actually a more accurate measurement of temperature? It takes a smaller change in temp to change 1 degree F than C.  For example, 159°F is 71°C when rounding, but 160°F is also still 71°C. Sure the metric system in every other way is better for science calculations, but in my opinion Fahrenheit is a better temperature scale. The only thing useful for Celsius is 0 is freezing temp of water, and 100 is boiling. But since that doesn’t matter here, sure you can do all your needed calculations in Celsius since all the formulas and math use it as the temp scale, but I’d still monitor the temp in Fahrenheit because it’s more accurate. But that’s just me lol
Beat that meat
You should have slapped a cook until he cooked a chicken for you   There you go with your food cooked with slaps
This belongs in a Modern Art Museum.
R u seriuosly copying Mark Rober videos? music and teaching....
Someone in the chat: Go chicken gooooo
1:26 kinky -jared kleinman
I feel like I'm watching a mark robers video, you literally copied his editing style and music xD
Anyone else getting Mark Rober vibes?
He gives me *strong* Mark Rober vibes.
It is slapping the shit out of the bacteria
I miss my brother...
Now in order to actually cook the chicken use 1 fillet and make it like from the pan.
Actually kelvin is what's used for real science
Now they will make flash slapped chicken to cook it in one of the movies or series. I'm waiting now. Lol

How did you get Hello Fresh to send you actually fresh food? I swear they only send me the jankiest overripe veg. Maybe its just a UK thing.
I'm just sayin if physical energy can be turned into thermal energy, how hard would i have to punch a chicken to cook it? - Jello
the mad lad did it.
Batman slap so hard that Robin had turn into "Red" Hood.  Get it cuz? When you slap you turn red.
This is what the internet was invented for!
9:20 patrzcie czat xD łeb rozjebany xD
It's not about cooking chicken, it's about sending the chickens a message

he has mark rober background music
Man caught beating his meat on camera
Too bad Unus Annus isn't here to see this moment
Fake ?
its happy to see, but im sad to say that its cooked, not by slapping but its basically hammering sooooo, well congrats🤣
This had so many fails but he pushed through it this was amazing
He looks like a offbrand Tommy innit
If I can turn physical energy into thermal energy, how hard would I have to punch a chicken to cook it?
Girlfriend:- What are you doing? Him:- Nothing, just beating my meat! Girlfriend:- WHAT? Him:- What?

Nick DiGiovanni: I'll take your entire stock
A few safety concerns a friend raised: When you have flying bolts and aluminium coming off your rig, maybe sitting next to it with only a pair of safety goggles is not the best choice.  Arteries are not nice to be severed by flying metal, among other bits of your body. When you have bits flying off, adding a 2nd motor may not be your best go to. Rushing over to play with the clearly smoking and plugged in electrical device is counter-indicated.  I believe the exact words were: "magic smoke came out, quick rush over and touch it while it's still plugged in" would be a bad thing. Eating the steak sandwich on pure eye-ball level of the bag which the same product had previously leaked fiberglass and other materials into the food product under stress may not be considered "wise". Simply turning your variac off at the switch while leaving it plugged into the power source after breaking is.... a poor choice. You may have wished to measure how much current you are drawing to see if your variac is rated for that. You apparently have no idea you should be controlling your motor speed with PWM for this kind of application. The person in question deals with electrical stupidity all day at work so didn't want to have to deal with it here too, so I have simply forwarded some of his observations.  You MAY wish to take them to heart as he seemed genuinely shocked that no-one was seriously injured in the video.
I’m getting major mark rober vibes from this video
The thing that makes your videos so awesome is you always come up with new stuff to get closer and closer to your goal after each time failing
Wheres Mark Rober collab???
that chicken is still raw.... you need to go again. it's not fully cook. you just reach the temp. you need the temp and  30 minutes of slap time at that temperature.
What about a Steak
The video I was introduced to you through has a sequel 💀
A machine that beats you're meat 👍🏿
May I introduce you to...  The Ball Cruncher
Finally you guys done it!!! Congrats!!!! <3
Haha jokes on you my meatbeater is way faster than that one   Somethings wrong isn’t it
Why
F for the Pivot
For the love of God season your chicken....
"the smell, it smells like steak"
Steak slap cooked could be beautiful  The meat would tenderise as it slow cooks
9:21 just look on chat "jebac disa" is Polish word
9:22 jd
the mark rober music is tech hahaha
Oh wow. Now try it on a fish
No one talking about the mark rober music?
FINALLY! I wasn’t here for it, but I was here for a long time.
My uncle would have my ass cooked like in 5 minutes
hey, same last name... nice
Oh yes the *Meat Beater*
In my opinion I don’t think this counts as slapping the chicken to cook it because of how hard the machine is pounding it.
Finally its been 83 years
Yeah..your experiment sucks..not even making your slapper more durable from the start..you should use your slapper to your self so you can wake up to the reality that you are not even close to cooking your chicken..hahaha..what a waste of life..pathetic
*Impossible*
Just watched a guy beat his meat for 13 minutes on youTube.
mad man actually did it
My arm is a meatbeater 9000
Science at its finest 😂🔥🔥🔥
you just made a video with peter sripol and you didnt even put his name on the tittle
Alternate title: *Beating* *my* *meat* *until* *it* *gets* *cooked*
Me: fainted because im still a kid with blablabla equations
Davie504 would be proud
This is a man who likes and knows how to beat he's chicken :).
bet davie504 can cook it
Why
My moms new toy uwu
Guga : let cook wagyu with this method
Dad 1: my kid is a lawyer  Dad 2: my kid is a doctor  Dad 3: uhhh..
Asian Moms: Thanks for the tutorial.
The Mark Rober music adds a really good touch
Who noticed mark robbers explaining music
You hit that chicken harder than my dad with a belt
boi why u got plastic knife and fork
I'm proud of you
i am commenting so i can edit it and write the OMG message after i get a lot of likes
Ta bien
I’m so proud of you
i don't understand, why not just cook it on a pan or something and save like 2 hours lol
At least don’t use the same music as mark rober XD.
I though this video was posted 10years ago but its 18hours ago
“The original meat beater”
Slap it again
Interesting. Id have used a pneumatic system with an actuating bi-valve. Centrifugal motion is difficult to reliably exchange into reciprocating motion. Take a reciprocal drill for example, you must supply the return force for the bit because the motor doesnt *actually* reciprocate it, it merely pushes it forward and out so as to put the brunt of the forcs on the bit and to keep any jerking or pulling stress off the drills own pieces.
So you didn’t actually cook the chicken .......   Quiters never win and winners never quit
Yo Mark Rober where you at?
why do Americans think that metric measurements are Communist even though everyone uses them except for america.
Someone needs to show this to Gordon Ramsey.
‘They cooked a chicken by slapping it’ is the new ‘they did surgery on a grape’.
Can't wait to tell my grandchildren.
Bruh imagine vegan watch this video. Watching animal being slap until cooked
We need this kind of science.
Whats the song used in the first part of the video
Modern Day Chicken Torture
"The original meatbeater"
Davie504 would love this
Everyone laughed until the chicken slapped back.
Medium rare chicken
He took beating his meat too serious
That steak was not cooked, it was still mooing! It needs to be brown inside!!!
ah yeah, the electrical appliances and smoke problem - you know electronics run on smoke, because if the smoke gets out, its broken
Human from the past: maybe we will have flying car  *The future hooman : wana slap chicken ass?*
U did ur part for humanity
Actually the temperature used for real science is Kelvin.
Cool idea and great follow through but take it down like 20%.
This video Slap!
Wonder what the neighbors thought of hearing the slap sounds tho
Sounds like the music Mark Rober uses in his videos.
You improved it huh
Good Ending.
How has there been no sexuality jokes made about the machine lmao
Maybe next we can find out: how many licks does it take till you get to the center of the? oh, oh?
"Meat beater"
At the groceries: "He's buying chicken ...*whispering* again..."
I hope I have that kind of budget to create something crazy
@davie504
Mr. Slapper
This whole video was just basically f=m x a
I watched this video all the way through, it was not what I thought. Wonderful Science though.
Man, I was about to click another video cuz I thought that was jake paul at the start of the video
YouTube randomly recommended me the last chicken slap video months ago and today i just opened up and saw this on my feeds it looks like i should really subscribe you since its fated
Teenage mark rober lmao The song is so familiar
When my grandchildren wants to find the answer they will see my comment here in the future.
*now you can cook chicken while tendering*
This is cheap and efficient engineering at its finest , it's a 'jugaad'
Entire vide format and music is def not stolen from some guy who used to work at nasa =)
This guy just coined a new term. Instead of beating a dead horse. Its now, "Slapping a dead cow." LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL
Mark rober 2.0?
Just ask davi504
In reality kelvin is the real science temperature measure
1:55 just play it on slow something looks off
Slapping the chicken doesn't taste good at all.
All the dislikes are from salmonella and e. coli.
Wait how many breaths on the chicken will cook it
Its done finally!  Now i can rest in peace.
He... *Dumped the juice????*
gordon ramsay be like ITS NOT COOKED PROPERLY YOU DONUT me : this is chaos
Gordon Ramsey You Gotta Drop A Video With Your Reaction On This Steak "DAWG"😂😂 @gordonramsey
this is just a Mark Rober video, but Louis smoked something better

No one gonna talk about 1:55
You know those moment where you just sat there wondering what the hell have you been doing in your life? Yeah. That's what I felt while watching this video.
now... how about a ham?
"How many slap does it take to cook a chicken?" I don't need sleep, I need answers dammit
Hey are you part of the VCDL
i cant stop laughing
mark rober question mark?
Slap-vide
Wow you tenderize and cook your steak at the same time, such revolutionary idea
Should have put some MSG in there. Partner with Guga to grill the steak and chicken after slap cooking it.
The meat beater. Sound... familiar?
You deserve all the views on YouTube
Meat Beater lmao ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
HYDRAULIC PRESS CHANNEL :D
You spent so much time trying to figure out if you COULD do the thing you never stopped to consider if you SHOULD do the thing...
Fun fact: Girl before dating downloaded this machine to her hand
now perfect the method, work your way up to THE SINGLE SLAP COOK
ahhh engineers. they solve problems. like slapping chickens.
U look like mr beast
I live this guy’s determination. I wanted to find out as well.
Its my 1st time to watch your Video LOL your Voice is Looks like MR.BEAST Voice... 🤣🤣...

Let's keep the dislikes 999
You are really persistent are you? Good job by the way
So this is how people level up when beating the meat 😂
LETS GOOOOOOOO,NO CHICKEN WILL BEAT US
Bacteria didn't die by the heat it died by "Slaps"
Note: You did not look for this.  . . . But hey... you found it
please don't try to cook your chicken like this. Unless you want to let the person you hate got salmonella... go ahead.
9:21 nice koments
Invert that steak cooking process. Bring it from frozen to 30 with slaps, then sear, then bake at 450 until 69°
Smooth slappin
Its actully called “The Chicken Smacer 9million”
He forgot to season it
Man imagine Linus water cooled the motor for him
Is no one else getting Mark Rober vibes from this video?  No? Just me?  Okay...
11:55 Jebać disa
Pro chef here. Just a tip, chicken is supposed to have an inner temperature of 67-68 degrees Celsius in order to make certain that absolutely no bacteria/parasites remain alive. Well, too late now I suppose.
So if this works we can also cook with chewing
We need davie504 !!..
Let's slap some butts!
Gordon ramsay: that's not how u cook a f'ing steak u donut
"Dear Santa I want a Meat Beater 9001 for Christmas" 😂😂😂
Dang, this chicken HITS different
So this is how prehistoric humans cooked before fire.
He has finally done it
Imagine using °F
You need cook it 3 hours…
In the future every house will have a meat beater 9001in it's kitchen
One of the greatest scientific endeavors of our time
Itd probably would’ve been more possible if you just cooked a piece of chicken, like the breast, instead of trying to cook the whole thing.
I feel like this could be really cool trying to cook a bread
Nie spodziewałem się jebania Disa w tym filmie XD 9:21
Perfect opportunity for a collab with Mr. BeatMyMeat himself rapper Ugly God
LETS GOO
Meat beater😭😭
Hold up who said you could slap cook chicken in the first place
Okay now cook an egg by slapping.

Welcome to the internet. First stop: How To Cook a Chicken by freaking SLAPPING it LMAO.   Kudos to this man for putting so much energy into this. And to the internet for supporting it.
Everytime the thing broke I was waiting on you to start manually slapping it for some reason.
"Original meat beater" lol
Jello is now happy
This chicken sacrificed its life to science... respect
I want to know how will Gordon ramsay react on this
Can you do this with my head
"meatbeater 9001"🗿
This invention should get a guiness  record and  890k veiws for the video  Burh YouTube sucks
mark rober is that you?
That steak was very tenderized
This music over an assembling montage is owned by Mark Rober!
This deserve a sub
I just want to say spam the link of this video to mark and Ethan
No! Cooked means 100°C! So you didn't actually cook the chicken.
The chicken set the world record on getting the highest slaps
This what happens if you put baby burper into Auto. _With speed_  The chicken sacrificed its life for the video... even its soul too takes damage
how’d you like your steak cooked, 100k slaps, 150k slaps, 200k slaps, or 250k slaps?
I've waited for this. Jejdjsksk
why is he saying C not celcius...
cook one more and eat it!
why are you trying to cook chickens using slaps
Now do it manually using hands
"He is a man of focus, commitment and sheer fucking will"
My God, it's already answered for real this time
"9 degrees see!" Lol
The meek dad etiologically peel because singer acly offend afore a penitent chair. dangerous, interesting squid
9:42 when he changed the meat! :) Playing sneak
*CRACK TEAM OF DISCORD ENGINEERS*
Accidentally clicked the wrong video, and at he first 10 seconds, it reminded me of the how much slap does it take to cook a chicken video, and watched all of it.
what about u marinate the steak first and then u slap it?
All of this from one joke from unus annus
Balian?
You should have just called *DAVIE 504* To slap the chicken
Blood pouring out of it omggggg itz cooked
This man really wants some chicken!
It's all fun and games till the chicken says  "beat me harder Daddy"
Slapp!
now lady s hot slap is real
That thing hit harder than what I did to my ex
Mark rober lite 😁
No one's going to talk about the Mark Rober song?
cook a chicken with one slap
bruh I remember when you had 50k subs.  now you have like 350k  keep on the good work
Here before this go viral
This is revolutionary
All I heard was blah blah blah chicken..blah blah blah slap..blah blah.. salmonella  Glad to see you've succeeded in cooking it!
Guy: beats his meat 888k people (and counting): “Interesting”
Peter bruh ?? Plane chicken ? Haha
It’s simply a tenderizer on steroids. A tenderizer that cooks.
OH MY GOD
wow!
YOU MAD MAN YOU DONE IT
Noice
Let gugafoods prep it and he could prolly make that slap steak taste gourmet
My mother's air fryer "Finally, a worthy opponent. Our battle will be legendary."  The meat beater 9001 "skadaboooooosh!"
He literally said I didn't beat the meat fast enough so it needs to slap it harder
He's too dangerous to he kept alive
I always wanted to see this but when you failed I was sad now so yay

Mark rober 2?
Does that mean we can cook a pack of rice by slapping it?
For thousands of years man struggled to feed himself. Now, man need not fire to feed himself. Just a mighty many slap
What about a barrel shape with rubber slappers?
Trust the science! Lol
Davie504 needs to see this
am i only one person who noticed that he won nike contest and hes testing mars yard 2.5?
This just reminds me of [DELETED CHANNEL] and I just feel sad again
The old fashioned way.
Mithblsters already did this back in 2018
He did what Unnus Annus couldn't do, what a damn legend
I can't believe I just watched a video of a guy slapping his chicken.
How to disinfect your chicken for 10 hours more
Just use a stove for god's sake!
Alright I love it already
Absolute madman
I’ve seen the streams in my recommendation tab, glad things turned out to work.....*sorta*,least you got that steak though!
Today on Slap Vide Everything...
Not even a gourmet restaurant has chicken as expensive as this one
Huh, quite surprised no one made a joke about 1:56...
No fucking way
Is that inspired by the slapsgiving episode?
Guga must see this video
So guys, we did it.
i am now a vegetarian
DAVIE504 REVIEW THIS PLEASE!!!
I thought this was an I did a thing video lol
69504
Nick swardson cooks a chicken
YouTube recommending me Gems 🤔
If you want to cook chicken by slaps, u know who to call... Davie504.
The man’s actually done it!
🤔the power of a slap 🧐
Where is Kyle Hills
So, does this go in The Guinness Book of World Records?
This man’s editing is becoming more like Mark Rober, it’s starting to worry me.
What's up SLAPPERS. Davie504 approved this. OMG! CHECKMATE!
Lmafo if you think that real idk what to tell you like why would it be burn on the outside c'mon now
k
I think Davie504 should see this
Not tender after all that slapping
Mate that was awsum your a commited evil genius great vids what's next ?
Sir how do you like your chicken to be cooked? Me: Slapped
He could of finished it easily if he turned the rgb on for the pc fans
some one literally did it....bruhhhhh
I swear you spent 1000 hours trying to do this watching your 100s of streams doing this (I’m over exaggerating) IM UNDER EXAGERATUNG
“Pinikpikan”
Is this inspired by a certain video from a deleted channel?
9:21 wstyd mi za kolesia na czacie.
Another recommended video that seems like a cult activity   I'm glad to be a part of it
The far sagittarius focally tremble because knight bacteriologically knit regarding a jumbled friday. garrulous, intelligent change
*Never let it be said that boys going through puberty don't cook*
doesn’t this mean that you can TECHNICALLY cook a chicken with ONE PERFECT slap ???  like speed-wise????
You took the whole definition of  "beating your meat" to a whole new level
The eat ad is the worst. You get the best part of fast food (delivery at the front door) and the worst part of cooking (cooking itself) and you pay more for the same results...
11:54 chat. Mmm i love polish people
Beat the meatt
He ain't giving up the slap machine
U can just use an oven    Or my mom
Bro he called the original meat beater that's not right lol 😂😂😂😆
Nnnnnbbbbb(mom nmbn
Asking mom for slapped meat for dinner     Thats not what i meant
The madman actually did it

1900s inventors made the car the pc 2000s inventors CHIKEN SLAP
So... did anyone else watch this entire video with their mouth hanging open in an expression of abject horror and visceral distress? I actually cringed and curled up into a ball as he cut open the steak bag and that brown... sludge came out and... **retches** Nope!
it looks like cooked to you?
Two things come to mind: Mythbusters and Unus Annus.
I only knew about the "kicking the dead horse"...now they added "slapping the dead chicken and EAT IT!"
Mark Rober of Chicken
What bothers me is there real problems in this world that needs brain power not slapping chicken. Why don't you engineer a system that generates electric from waves in the ocean. Or how we can harness the water from all the melting ice or how we can clean the air. C mom man don't just sit around slapping your chicken.
imagine cooking a beef with slapping by using the chicken slapper      *im subbed*
I instantly recognised the background music you used , Mark Robber uses it a lot lol
This is very haram
By God he's done it, the missions done...the nightmares..they're over...
I love how he calls it T H E   M E A T  B E A T E R
man, u beat the meat faster than my uncle
well this was interesting
Auto click? Auto slap?
Finally
The next Mark Rober.
Imma buff up myself just to eat a slapped chicken 😅😆 cause i can't do science shirt 😆
Ayyy Adam Ragusea mention
Although it's a impressive feat this seems more like a lesson in putting in the effort and money from the start to avoid having to redo something 10 times.
The  fresh beast significantly tickle because pike thankfully fill unto a physical whistle. known, languid sailboat
it’s called the meat beater 9001 and this 1:55? what.
*MEATBEATER 9001* he said it himself don't say anything to me...
_5years later-_ *_5 things humans doing weird experiment on chickens_*
He named his Machine *meat beater* Everyone : Ah... I see he is man of culture
Howtobasic has been real quiet since this came out
I would like my chicken slapped
Guga foods will be jealous.
Gotta get myself an MB9001  😎
Why i heard mark rober's default music in this? Ew,
Wtf , are those Mars yards on his feet?
Is this JoJo reference?
SLAPP (like now)
Where can I buy one?
Yes
my homies slappin neighbor's chickens for dinner
1:55 YOO WHAT WAS THAT
Mark rober 2
Just hire Davie504, problem solve
That's how the mongols invented the hamburger.  😂 oversimplefeid.
A new cooking source the slapper
Where i live we use ovens to cook chicken. Google 'oven' if you can...it is much easier and less time consuming.
From slapping bass to slapping chicken
"Meat Beater 9000" 🤜🥩
I was waiting for this video after watching thr first attempt.
Wait what... you came back to it?.... POG
Aaaaaah...  What a man does to eat a slapped chicken
the madlad actually did it
He sounds like a really excited Jerry Seinfeld when it reaches 60°C
*when they say ima beat my meat but they really meant it*
See, this is the kind of innovation that will drive our species forward.
I thought mr. Beast would have done that first, but........... I like this too.
I just got the name *meat beater* lol
Alright who tagging @TheRussianBadger and Jello?
I genuinely didn't think I'd see another chicken slapping video, from the same person or otherwise.
Meatbeater9001 thats what i call my right hand
Plot twist: You can Cook Meat Just you Putting it on a grill
Well its 4 am here in Mexico  And i have no idea why im seeing this But now  I believe in god and science  Now let's fucking save the earth
Dude just say Celsius! “Sea” isn’t a measurement of temperature
This is what we require - innovation. Something for the human race to be proud of.
"Hello Fresh is basically the opposite from the Chicken Slapper"  Thanks, but there goes all my interest
This is what humans spend their brain cells on and I'm all for it.
Send one to guga foods
Redditors assemble!
Mark rober where are you watch this vid xD
Took a whole new level of "beating your meat"
Now attach the meat beater to a v8
YouTube certainly knows me well because the video was posted 16 hours ago and I got it recommended just now.
Yess, I've been waiting for this part 2.Thank you♥️♥️
Where are The davie 504 slappers
What beauty
The short beret anteriorly appreciate because italian normally melt towards a entertaining atom. oval, thick philippines
pogger!!!!!!!!
Meat beater 🤣
Change the title from chicken to steak
Its important the world needs this desperately
before 1m
You can use wheel attached with many slappers but why you don't?
alright time to build this and pull it out on the next family barbecue
Hey, nice to see Peter there
The madlad did it.
WAIT THIS IS JUST SLAB BASED SOUS VIDE!
Gotta say I appreciate YouTube showing me the update as I only ever saw the original video from this guy. I checked the channel and it didn't tickle my fancy. But I like a completed story.
They said it couldn't be done and we said SLAP SLAP SLAP SLAP GOD DAMIT SLAP FASTER HARDER
do it again and eat the chicken
Don’t beat your meat
Your goofing around on the design my guy. Why make a hammer when you can just have a wheel with slappers extending out on four sides? Hook it up like a weed wacker and your spm will quadruple!
How about using the color black since it absorb heat so it rises faster? Idk if it works btw.
Final result : 9:44
man never gives up on his dream
Why you copying Mark Rober song? Get ur own dude
Beating the meat. The Movie.
Guy in 1990: I bett we will have flying cars by 2021   *2021:*

Now thats a good beat of a meat hihi
This Youtuber Is Exactly Like Mark Rober But Better

50 years later, people will come back here to salute his Genius.
*slap*
How many Cut g's was that?
Season the meat!!!
He actually did it
The greatest discovery of our generation
This dude forgot to correct his title to "I actually cooked a steak by slapping it"
POV: Ur looking for vegans hating this.
Doing more important things than mark rober
Next it would be cooked pork with slaps machine
Boys during puberty:

I think Davie504 would love this slapper! :D
You make this experiment looks like a scene from ford v ferrari when they make a ford gt40
Beat the meat!!!

The fact hydraulic press channel is intreste din slap cooking a chicken concerns me

I wish i were taught physics in school with dumb examples, im sure it would have been 10x more interesting
Lol it's the third or fourth vedio
Kinda upset he walked out the room with the “cooked” steak...
So when is Mr. Beast gonna slap a chicken 135,000 times
I literally just saw the first attempt video yesterday and was so sad he couldn’t do it. This does put a smile on my face.
Ayyyyyy
4,000th
the flash could open a a slapping roast restaurant
i want steak now
"Dave, it's the chicken guy again!" "Oh he's back, huh?" "Yeah, he says he needs another whole chicken." "Uh-huh. What's this guy using them for anyway? What a weirdo."
That cow is still saying muuuuuuu
Finally chicken. I been waiting for so long.
The sheer absurdity of it, and yet the focused methodical approach with literally every step taken as a learning cue is just, incomparably satisfying. After seeing this , all I wish is that one day I have the money and time and to do things like this on a regular basis in my own home. On the outside this whole exercise sounds and looks like a fool's errand but it's truly not. I am not an engineer and have zero qualifications in that field but what I learned from this video is that the theoretical approach if sound on the basics of science, can never be wrong, it can only be non pragmatic. But it also demonstrates one really fundamental flaw of the machines of today, our limitation is not of knowledge and innovation but more of physical limitations of our machines like friction et al. This tomfoolery makes it apparent that maybe we don't need another discovery like quantum science for another leap forward, but we just need to make our machines better to produce this century's scientific breakthrough.
2:09 Ahh yes pro editing
That chicken would be nice with a glass of milk
My guy just did MrBeasts video
I subscribe, you have earned it
Masterpiece of engineering indeed....
So you failed and never completed this start to finish
f*cking mad lad
Everybody gangsta until he gets salmonella
Just put it in the oven
This will be surely registered in the history of internet....
While we have been living our lives , this dude was busy doing this
Yessss
Now serve that chicken to Gordon ramsay
i gotta say man this was really awesome to watch :) just nice to know when someone asks "can you cooka chicken by slapping it?" all of us from here "yes"
Basically beating meat.
They called me a madman
Yes! I've been waiting for this update!!!!

Mark Rober 2.0
Try the same thing with an LS V8 !
Can we just appreciate what an absolute madlad this guy is
food wars should have cooking like this,and the point is 100
Dummy you can't cook like that at 60°
imagine using an OVEN to cook your meat
it’s 1:57 a.m and Im watching a guy making a very fast slapping machine to cook chicken to see if it’d work, I like it
Man that steak just need some searing on a pan...
👍
They said it couldn't be done...
What is wrong with the world?
Just wait until Davie504 sees this
Congratulations for actually doing it. You have my respects
When you're beating your meat but your parents are almost home  9:17
#unus_annus_memento_mori
Davie504 must see this
liked the vid and commenting for algorithm more people must see this.
U just transformed to Mark robber.... even ur way of talking ... just perfect 👍🏻😂
You remind me of Mark Rober😂Who else agrees.
This takes beating your meat to a whole new level
Honestly, just shred that up & sprinkle over ramen. Would make a filling snack.
LMAO AFTER ALL THE STREAM LMAO YOU ACTUALLY DID IT IM DEAD
Why didn't you just choke it bro no homo
Crazy that a restaurant can’t even get medium rare right
Wtf did i watch
Finaly
I wanna be as smart as you :')
Just use an oven      *for legal reasons, this is a joke*
I can't believe you did it!
He bloody fookin did it
This video slaps.
So basically what i learned was u can slap ur chicken into medium rare and be good
Davie504 wants to know your location.
this is the perfect 3am content
Salute! The things you do for science 😂
Where’s mark rober on this chat !
That chicken kinda...T H I C C
gordon ramsay wants to know your address

Gordon Ramsey roasted you.
I was about to click on another video but then I saw this...
Yoooooo it's Peter!
Finally I can rest in peace somewhat
Woah.. you have 300k subs now! I remembered subbing at 70k
ginger mark rover?
This is all because of a fucking reddit post
David504 be like:  *Slap like now *  69420 *OMG*
People are gonna probably try cooking chicken using a slap machine and turn this into speedrunning in the future
11:44 Energy conservationist would be mad about it
Nasa should hire this man
Madlad
This should be trending rn idk why it isnt
I appreciate his work but i dont think its cooked from slapping he might have used a cooked one to bait us
This is literal MAD SCIENCE!
Meat Beater 12000
The man did what unus annus couldn't do
THIS IS WHAT ENGINEERING IS ABOUT
Why is this not on trending?
The meat beater 5000
u forgot to season it

He did it, the mad lad actually did it
The Mark Rober not so human changing experiments
SCIENCE
Mark rober will be proud of you🎉🎉
Me: *Slaps Chicken* This bad boy is now cooked
Let's eat the 🍗   🤤
I literally don't get why murica loves their "Freedomheit". When Celsius is much better.
Yes yes yes yes
1:54 😂😂 legends can understand 😂😂
SLAP LIKE NOW!!
You finally did it
Should season it with salt & pepper.
When someone cooking meat by just slapping it cooks it better than you can
@davie504
Man, here I subrcibed to you a couple of months ago when you had like 20k and now ur channel has grown so much, well deserved
why not create something that instead of going up and down to slap it does a full rotation with like 4-5 flaps slapping the chicken while spinning. the flaps can be flexible enough to actually slap the chicken and not rip it apart
Ah, yes, the *M E A T   B E A T E R*
Some bdsm dude is going to try this one out for sure.
While the wooden core does add some rigidity, it's primary purpose is to prevent buckling.  Didn't like my idea using micro-slapping inducers, huh?  Hmm...  Well, congrats.
He fu*king did it this madlad did it
He definitely switched plates
MEAT BEATING
Im surprised that plastic fork can cut through that steak easily
Wow
Gordon Ramsey wants to know your location....
Guga: Yes. Now cook Wagyu.
Imagine having to forcefully choose slapping a chicken to cook it rather than actually baking it in the oven.  First of all thats dedication but second of all imagine you were starving and your only cooking tool were your 135,000+ slaps.
Davie504 : Wise choice...
Call davie, and then slap a bass on the chicken
Cooked a chicken by slapping.... 687k people : intresting
*Davie504 would be proud.*
Sorry. Real science uses Kelvin.
Friend: “so? what is your favorite way of cooking?” Louis: “its... complicated”
Girls: Carefully cook the chicken using the oven.  Boys:
Why?
Soo you just wasted money and time for this stupid idea wow i hope i will not end up like this.
You look like a younger Hacksmith
No
Let's gooooo
13 mins of a guy beating his meat.
Im here before 1m views
A long way!  This proves dedication matters no matter how many times we fail!  Glad to be a part of it from the beginning!🇳🇵💕💐

Slap your chicken now
Meat beater... Wise choice of words
Wait so how many slaps between all the fails and success?
YYYYEEESSSSSS I watched the first few vids when he tried this and I’ve been waiting for him to actually accomplish it LEETSSSS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Yes, just what i need, MEAT BEATER 9000
Worth it
I thought of unus annus when youtube recommended this to me
Hey you should collab with Michael and come up with bizarre creations that should not exist😂😂😂    Try creating meat beater😂😂
Please don't tell me people didn't have a fetish of slapping the chicken T_T
YEEEEAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHGHAAAAAAAAA
Gordon Ramsay: watches the video  MasterChef Gordon: I've seen a slapping machine cook better than you, it's RAW
b****
All of this just to prove some guy on Reddit wrong
Plastic spoon and knife? I QUIT!
Now thats how you beat your meat.  Lol.
You lost such an opportunity for a joke when you tasted the steak: Honestly this steak SLAPS...                                Ok i'll see myself out....
This channel goes from thousands views into 600k view in a half day.  Good job dude!

Chicken: R.I.P Chicken Slapper: Peace was not an Option! Chicken: There's no God!
well hi, welcome to the recommended page
I was here for the first one
"MEAT BEATER"          hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Russian Badger fans were lining up to watch this video
What a miracle fire is. It requires way less energy/heat to produce and maintain while cooking store-bought meat than the Meat Slapper 9001.  Anyone else mildly surprised we don't have historical evidence of people trying to cook meat by slapping it than by placed above flames? One might think the slapping idea preceeded using fire. We are a dumb species afterall.
I remember when he had 30k subs and watch him don't forget me Louis I have Louis on my name to :)

9:20 Jebać Disa
You earn more heat with the motor heat dissipation
Now imagine the chicken was alive...
this takes "beating my meat" on a whole new level
*Everything is fun until the chicken starts slapping back*
Sell these slappers
9:21 in the chat
We just watched history being made
This is gonna scare some kids
Mark Rober music
Oh wow... and there's Peter Sripol. There was plane stuff everywhere and I didn't notice.
For real science K is used
So that's how my mum cooks the chicken so fast ....
People in 1890: oven mah dud People in 2021: S L A P
what an absolute madlad
Try beef slaping
I want to comment a lot of not so nice words about what this guy is up to but instead, I just want to say, if this makes you happy, then continue doing it.
I love the chat comment at 11:55. Guy called 'Mielonka Mielona' meaning 'Ground luncheon meat', spams "fucking dissing (you)".
Thats just raw meat.
alternative way: train hard like Saitama, and slap the chicken once
Im so proud to be here the day the chicken was finally cooked by a slap.
Bro said meat beater 😏😏
So next is that whole shouting at the coffee meme?
planet earth is the place interdimensional cable is made for the universe i swear

Someone inform Kyle!
Well nobody understood what he explained but still enjoyed it
12:22 professional idiot. Hey, I feel attacked! Also, that's a great band name 😂
HOLY SHIT YOU DID IT
11:36 minimum of 135,000 slaps (6 to 8 hours) to cook a chicken. You're welcome 😉
God that fucking chat is atrocious 😂
This is why I love science
"Fire was discovered 1.7-2 million years ago" Humans before 1.7-2 million years ago:
In a parallel dimension: *Who's a bad girl in need of a spanking* >=)  *Slap sound intensifies*
So a few days ago I was watching an engineering video where they said that thermodynamics was a major subject of mechanical engineering. I didn't understand why at the time, until just now 😁
Dude I bet you ALL the chicks
wise choice
New meaning to be beating your meat
Probably not the only one to notice this. An improvement to the arm instead of having a friction heavy slot to transfer the rotational motion to reciprocal, an intermediate connecting rod, like on a steam engine or an oil well (and  come to think of it, if the assembly was balanced like the examples too)would give the same result and could possibly help with the stress and efficiency.
I slap my chicken every night
9:20 HISTORY IS MADE Comments : jebać disa
Disliked for clickbait
You're telling me you can slap a steak as hard as possible and cook it?
My dirty mind: Yooo i want auto meat slapper i finally can finally do something with two hands instead of one.
Nobody gonna talk about cutting steak with a plastic knife
Worst part of it that you take the bag and walk off camera , that raise many doubt to many ppl.
Pfft, who needs this overcomplicated machine if you have Davie504
You should call this "The Ex Wife 9001"
9:20 HISTORY IS MADE, FOLKS! 😉About 342,250 slaps! There you go!
Louise: "The steak is done!"  Me: "Um, Actually, I believe the steak is medium rare.."
Remove the slap plate at the end... Attach a fleshlite... Ooh buoy...😂😂😂😂💦
we all saw this pop up and clicked immediately.
Reject oven Return to slap
You're insane
4:20  As a chef, I thank you for sharing with the world the fact that chicken definitely does not have to and should not reach 165F internal in most cases
Our God of Slaps (Davie504) should be proud of you.
I love the mark rober style😂
I have a test in 5 minutes but this is way more important
Congratulations 🎊 Louis! This is history-making, and exactly what YouTube is for 😊
Ok, when did science gatekeep units of measurements. It doesn't matter what you use, as long as you have accurate results.
1:26 Adjustable Slap Depth. What a great band name!
He did it. The madlad actually did it
0:57 Ah, I see you've gone with the Mark Rober music
69 420
Basically this is slapping the shit outta bacteria, clever, it's about sending a message
Davie504 will be proud

“The original meat beater”      LMAO
Not once have i thought that i would be cheering on some guy beating his meat on youtube... eh, worth it
Vegans watching this must be pissed
No chickens were harmed in the making of this video right?
where do people come up with this shit?  Man, covid has really twisted people's minds.  I guess normal society work kept people safe from using their imagination too much.  so much for society controls...
On another one of Peter’s friends to subscribe to!

Do you think you can cook a piece of chicken by putting a piece in your mouth and heating with furious chewing?
This chicken slaps.
He faked it wtfff
I think the main change that caused this try to work was the change to Celsius
I don't know what I'm about to watch but I really need to see this  The multitude of thinga I have seen leaves me in aw not only did you cook a steak ans chicken with slaps but you cut the steak up with a plastic knife and fork I am disturbed

Faster Slap Rate
He said meat beater that’s sick my mind is 😂
Now i can just remember that one quote in reddit  "Science is not about why, its about why not"
they said it was impossible...
The ultimate madlad
Leave it to us white people to spend 2 months cooking a chicken and still not putting any spices on it...
So this is what it means "slap so hard"😏
Nigga really did it.
The real question is can it cook a human.
Pre chewed steak
I feel an indescribable happiness
Yooo chicken slapperrrrrr
If you had spit on the bag containing the chicken it would have made it cook a lot faster. I know this from experience because my nympho wife says her rear feels a stinging hot sensation when I slap it after i spit on it compared to when I don't spit on it. Trust bro it works.
10:03 Gordon Ramsay would be proud
Your pimp hand is strong
Davie504 approves of this
THE AMOUNT OF LIVES I HAD TO WATCH
bro imagine getting to be one of the chosen chickens that gets to be slapped, those chickens are legends
Someone from the Facility needs to tell Kyle about this!!!

Yes one day ima go to my neigbors yard and slap his chicken and would have food for 2 days

Cook your self
Now u just gotta patent it and slap a fleshlight on it 😆
Blowie matron???
This is beating your meat with extra steps
That thang bleeding
I watched that entire first video. That's why I recommended me this video. but I did not expect you to actually do another one. Wow I cannot wait to watch it. because like most people I'm commenting before I watch... Lmao 🤣🤣
The Meat Beat 9001 is a perfect name
*i can slap faster than that*
Meatbeater9000
Can't believe he ate a steak with no seasoning
you named it the meat beater? i need elaboration on its purpose
@davie504 slap like now!
Dont use the mark rober music
Make a video where instead of chicken is your arm
davie504 will be happy for u
This took “beat your meat” a bit too literally
Nice. You got a rice cooker.
Just amazing
Did anyone else watch this because of Unus Annus ? :)
People: barbeque,fry,pan,baked chicken  He: what about slapped chicken ?
Gordon Reactions when he saw this
Mark rober vibes
5:57 every machine is a smoke machine if you operate it wrong enough
cap stop  the lying
Why was it obvious that some madlad really tries to cook a chicken by slapping it and actually succeeded
tbh thats not chicken though
Yo this video slabs
The eye round is extremely tough see if it would save the texture
The chicken is getting violated so hard...
should’ve at least marinated it
The slapper dual motor setup has 3 times as much horsepower as my 50cc motorcycle and it's makin me sad
Mad respect. 😂
Lol this is the most random video ever. but pretty cool

Now when I talk dirty to my girlfriend I can say, "Hey babe, tonight I'm gonna COOK that p_____!" lol
Someone send the video to gordon ramsay for confirmation is the slap really effective.
Nobody suggested lotion!?
This is really important
Slap made chicken
Imagine dying just to get cooked by someone on the internet slapping your corpse with a machine
you forgot to season it 😩
Part of youtube that matter
Bro you using the same music as Mark rober and it's throwing me off
Five Finger Death Punch approves this video.
the madlad did it...
This might actually revolutionize the way people tenderize and cook meat at the same time
With all of this SLAPP I'm surprised I don't see more Davie504 comments. DAVIE WHERE YOU AT
*SLAPS*        Asian mama be like: :P
Why not slap the top an aluminum surface with the meat beater and have your meal mounted to the bottom so ya dont end up with pre a.b.c smush. You would still get heat transfer and  could "beat" it as hard as your machine could handle or even try friction cooking next.
Why can't you seem to secure something to a floor or keep a piece of aluminum from breaking.
Yuck. Undercooked chicken.
Finally .....  Inner peace
your videos are getting better and better

Hmm This is Basically a large tattoo machine! Rotary tattoo machines need a mechanism to hit softer, where as a Coil machine hits softer or harder and doesn't need to run faster or slower to do so.. If you do a further build i bet a magnet based machine could help you! Fun idea none the less ;)
I like to believe this is how we would’ve cooked food if we never discovered fire
You're like Mark Rober. But you actually say swear words
This guy beat his meat cooked
10:03 "IT'S FUCKING RAW!" -Gordon Ramsay

No chickens we’re harmed during the making of this video
And that kids is how you beat your meat  but i personally like to do it in the bathroom :smugface:
"oh no! We're out of gas to cook!" Me:let's eat outside My mom:
All you actually had to do was ask Davie504, nothing is better at slapping than he is.

"Hey honey, I'm gonna go beat my meat"  "Ok, can you put some ranch on mine?"
absoloute madlad
If I we're you I would've let Davie504 SLAPP it.
The fact that he didn’t sear the steak after cooking triggers me
now burn wood by slapping
Not trying to shit on it, but going off camera with the bag before showing us how it looks is kinda sus
When you don't pay your stove bill:
6:29 voicecrack lol
Literally everything is a meme now. Memes are real life.
Can someone clear up my doubt. He left the room and I don't know if he swapped out the bag or something. I don't want to be a douchebag because it's such a fun project to do lol.
Isnt that peter sripol's workshop?  ~sees peter~ nevermind, that explains it
Kinky XD
what an absolute madlad

Hey he fuckin did it
Woah. Peter Shripol
*PAP PAP PAP PAP* Dad: son, what u doin in there? Son: im cooking chicken. Dad: .... k, wash yer hands afterward, yeah? 😂😂😂😂
When humans fail to grasp the fact that they, and what they do.... are superfluous.  Not to mention the other glaring fact that eating this chicken cooked at such a low slow temp is dicing with salmonella/Clostridium Perfringens....not too bright for a guy that is attempting to display intelligence.
I can't believe I actually got an answer to this.
“The reason we cook our meat is to kill the bacteria it contains which in the case of chicken is campylobacter or SAM O NELLA”  Hey kids
Yeah you really enjoy Hellofresh recipes
it looks faked,even sous vide meat does not have a graduation of colour like that unless there is external searing..
Peter was there nice
I love that hes using the mark rober music

This channel has the same energy as mark rober
So basically you said you're cooking  a chicken to eat by slapping it then pre cooked a steak and ate it.
Who else noticed the mark rober music in the background at the explanatoin

My mom’s better than that slapper
ROFL
Any matching is a smoke machine if you use it wrong enough
Imagine being a chicken only to be killed and slapped a million times
Wait didn’t unnus annus do this?
I was like just cook a steak to rare which is 120f ... then five seconds after typing the video said let’s cook a steak
He is like Mark Rober but with less subscribers.
The meat beater is just me on December 1st
fantastic
This Dude Looks Like His Name ist grasin
You could really have used a thermal imaging device, aka infrared camera, to detect early problems in the overheating of the equipment as well as monitoring the heat build-up and dispersion on the chicken. Something basic like a Flir EX4 is affordable and will give you proper readings. Heck, even one of those $200 smartphone add-on would have worked better than nothing.
This is one of the best things on the internet.
Let's see if you can get more likes slapped than it takes to cook a chicken ✋👍🐔
why am I here lmao
So which Physic Law is this?  Charles's Law?  edit: I think its Boyle's.

Make Cooper heat dissipators to transfer heat from the motors to the chicken
Am I the only one who thinks this guy is a wannabe Mark Rober?
The only cooking medium that cooks AND tenderizes your meal to oblivion at the same time
If that chicken can speak, he or she would say "oh yEAH Oh yeAH"
I think this is why we have vegans
Why do you even make leverage type of slapper while you can do easier, more stable, faster, and stronger piston type of slapper?
Gordon Ramsey has been real quite since this came out.
Next challenge: slap a chicken fast enough to make it cooked?
You could use a rubber paddle in a X shape and put it on the motor in the middle and see if that works  Edit: I forgot to mention this will also make the texture not shit
He defiantly has food poisoning
Congratulations man
aaaaa Unus Annus
Oh no my, FULL BRIDGE RECTIFIER

Finally a worthy opponent for mark
ah yes this is what I am watching at 12:30 am
This strange fellow uploaded a video about  beating his meat.
Anyone Else here thinking about that one RussianBadger Video where they discuss how hard ya gotta punch a chicken to cook it.
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Man got that mark rober music sheeeeeeeesssh
Do it again. No failure!
I should get some sleep
Wonder how many times I’ve cooked my meat while beating it 🤔.
Imagine a random student from the year 2165 just reading a book then suddenly reads about the first man in history to cook chicken using slaps.
Did anyone hear that the music in this video is the same as mark rober
Wait.  You sounds like @markrober
Gordon Ramsey after seeing this: GET THE F*CKING ROBOT'S

Lmao "meat beater"
Meat beater 🍆🙄
Pov : you are the next chicken to be slapped
this is _way_ more important than studying for my exams
Louis did you even salt it—
mark rober 2.0
Here’s another bad idea you should of made the slapper a mold of the chicken or something close enough since it’s kind of hard to be exact on something like that to maximize the surface area struck
So many triggered indians
Just use a oven
The update I have been waiting for.
Hmm, how 'bout a subwoofer oven?
You mad lad, you've actually done it. A weapon to surpass metal gear.

Did dis dude say meat beater 🥩🤛 🤣
I came looking for copper and I found gold
Someone get Davie504 to react to this 😂

I’m so glad u posted I love ur channel

Ya know I was just thinking that looks like peters shop... then I saw him like ohhhh
*THE CHICK SLAPPER* 🔥🔥🔥
Omg
tell me can you slap a cast iron pan to search a steak?
I just hate watching your engineering skills.
How tf did he cut a steak with a plastic knife

Oh Shit he fuvkin did it !!! 🤘🏾🤘🏾🤘🏾
You could have just hired some 13yr olds, they can beat meat very well!
They called him a madman
When you and your partner are a little too kinky
they gonna make a restaurant called the slap house
So, anyone else wondering what Gordon Ramsay would say to this?
This is what we actually care bout microwave go brrr
someone give him a nobel prize Edit: Hes like mark rovee
here the day this video was posted and before it gets to 1 million views!        (claim ur ticket by replying)
He didn't eat it...
Didn't eat the chicken. Dislike.
No don't kill Sam o' nella
HOLY-
1:04
1:55 That really, really, REALLY does NOT look right...
i call this,the Ultimate chicken slapper machine
Thank god it didn't become chicken paste
weird heard my parents doing the same thing in their room but the slaps sounded differently
Me: "Why not just cook a chicken breast first?"
Guys, this dude AT THE VERY LEAST deserves a damn "Like/Thumbs Up", let alone a sub!!! He put in A LOT of time, stress, and effort for us and DELIVERED!! 👏🐓
Mmm, meat slapping.
Oh my god he did it
he clearly likes it!
Davie504 approved
Mark rober music 😂
F
7:48”i wanted more than anything to eat a meal cooked by the power of slaps” *same*
Youtube algorithm brought me part 1 last week and now part 2? Guess I gotta sub now
It is done
Slaps Chicken, Davie504 approves!  69420 slaps, EPICO!
What the he'll I am watching how did I get here?
Im just glad to be apart of history.
I now know what im gonna ask Guga foods to try next with the A5 Wagyu Steaks.
I hear you’re using the music mark rober uses
"Like, Zoinks" soundin ass
You missed a chance to put “ft. Adam Ragusea”
Oh my god I watched that video just a few days ago, my recommendations are amazing
LETS GOOOOOOO
Yo ! 😂
Mark rober with perm
Just snap some twigs, and do the tom hank fire igniter. Then cook the chicken.
Let's Go lolz he has beat a lot of meat to get here today lolz
As a u a fan, I got memories from watching this lol
All I can think about is Unus Annus
all these issues with an electric motor. why not just go gas powered? a briggs & stratton motor?
Imagine how many chickens he used for this experiment
me when I get home after a long day at work  *it’s time to slap some meat*
Finally we have closure.
Salmonella party!!!!
Mark rober be like :flushed:
Gordon Ramsay: its Rawwww!!!
Unus Annus be quaking
You know what’s crazy, I’ve done hello fresh long before this and that meal he made at the end was the exact and I mean EXACT meal I made tonight and might I say it’s delicious
3:33 here we go
I want you to cook a chicken or steak with vibrations Did you accept this challenge
When i read the title i was blown away already
Celsius is better but if you want to use the SI unit for temperature use Kelvin
I'm early!
Hey whats that camper rc you have? Do you have a video on it?
In all good words that we know, if kinetic energy could be turned into thermal energy...how hard would i have to punch a chicken to cook it. And this man proved it in one video.
Grouse will be proud
Madlad
*Happy Davie504 noises
Ginger mark rober
Here before it goes viral
How many slaps for an egg
My mum can cook me with the belt
Imagine using this to beat the other kind of meat 😳
Finally, slap cooked chicken
This lad is mad
This got serious mark rober vibes
69,420 just gives me and the boys a really warm and welcoming sensation
A dead channel would be proud.
Mojang: *WrIgHt ThAt DoWn! WrIgHt ThAt DoWn!*
Now we can beat our meat
His neighbours must think that he goes on a beating ultra marathon once every few months while streaming it online lol
congratulations you are now a real slapper
"Meat beater"
It's fake he switched it when he went through the door
This man be beating his meat for 3 days straight.
If you seared your steak it probably would've turned out
HE DID IT, THE MAD LAD
What did I just watch?
its a good way to cook tought meats
Get a Ferrari motor 😱🤯
This video will make Gordon Ramsay go insane
Chicken : You put me in this position for 6 to 8 hours just to rheow me out and call me contaminated? My disappointment is immeasureable and my day is ruined
I'm just gonna say it     That's one way to beat yur meat ...
So technically, he beat his meat...but smarter?
F
Davie504: Finally a worthy opponent, our battle will be legendary
Watching this video after the first one makes me feel like I've seen history being made.
This man is out here doing real science.
5:21 ah yes I see a man of wisdom
someone call therussianbadger
Now do it by hand.
Lmao the Meat Beater 9001
Chicken Slapping Machine: A like ya Cut G  Chicken: 🍑🍗
Been keeping tabs on this for months lmao
When he said meat beater my parents eas beside me and my heart pump very hard
When he said meat beater my parents eas beside me and my heart pump very hard
bro write a scientific journal article and get that shit published
MY MURICAN UNITS
Davie 504 liked this
Chicken: bokbokbokbokbok Louis Weisz: imma slap the shit out of u
When we go extinct, and aliens discover this video to cook our dead bodies by slapping it.
“Time to slap some meat” best quote ever
Oh he’s totally taking tips from mark rober, not just the music, but the pacing, explanation, editing, and broll. Looking great 👍
Ok now try it with a handheld meat tenderizer
He's gonna be the one to save the earth
I feel like I should be watching this in incognito mode
Imagine getting your hand stuck in there though
Coal
The man did it.  He cooked a damn chicken slapping it.
Hmm mark rober looks a little different in this one
*After watching this. *In the desert at night w/o ways to produce fire to cook. Me: I have ways to provide.
You need to, nay, MUST submit this as a paper for an Ig Nobel Prize :D
YES
I see how he did not use any kind of meat (exept chicken) because  the chat will say beat my mea-
No one: Oven: What am I to you?
I've got my own meat slapper, it works really well for a bit but runs out of energy before things get cooked, which is probably for the best
Firstly, big like for an American who uses degree Celsius. You sir, are intelligent.
m
Mark Rober V2
Amazing.  Got this recommended in  16 hours of release.
Why not have a wheel with semi-rigid springs attached at the 4 cardinal points with paddles at the ends of the springs?  That would quadruple the slappage
Meat beater.  That's my girl's nickname.
How could people dislike this video, this is a revelation!
You wanna be mark rober so bad lol
Davie504 will be happy to hear this discovery
HE UPGRADED TO STEEL :O
You did it, you crazy soab you did it
Dude it can’t be that hard to make shit that doesn’t break, what is this the 3rd yt video you posted about this?
Just a question if you ever see this. Why didn't you go with a cammed system instead, would float be the issue or added stress to the motor for how fast you needed it to go?
The future of cooking is now
So you can teoretically kill someone by slaping them 140k times and burning the hell out of them? Nice.
The possibilities are ENDLESS
Nice😎
the background music is familiar
Holy shit he actually did it
This is the definition of beating a dead horse
Gitter click the chicken
This is beyond genius
For the next try.. attach the chicken on a wheel and put rubber pads on the outside of the wheel rig and let it spin! Kinda like wheel of fortune but chef style!
Try  cooking it via  pressure.
"It looks kind of almost like.... soft" Meanwhile he cut a steak with plastic knive
imagine you are dead only to be slapped to another dimension
Is this a part 2
We need Johny cash
yeah
This guy puts in so much effort in his videos and they're entertaining af, how does he not have over 1 million subs already?
8:18 😳
mark rober music
Momento Mori
That steak... It's fucking RAW
Whoa! This has been quite the journey. Congratulations!
This indirectly answer's Unus Annus's question.
Next video "I actually set a chicken on fire by slapping it" ?  Please?
Guga foods needs to see this
It's fucking raw
Slam. Poultry.
You will always remember where you were when the phrase "slapping the chicken" ceased to be merely a euphemism.
FINALLY WE DONE IT
thank you youtube recommendation
Ah yes, this is the way my ancestors cook their chicken way before fire
This truly deserves a noble prize lmaooo
Ur a second Mark Rober
Chicken could have done with some butter and herbs in the bag!  I wonder if you could build a rotary slapping machine with multiple arms for rapid slapping
Where did this trend even come from
We make sure your meat is 100% cooked by slapping power if not you can get   food for free
9:45 Guga Foods needs to see this.
Well that meat has thus been beaten
Mark Robber lol no I’m not being mean because your more interesting
Please write a legit scientific paper on this and a submit it to be published. PLEASE!
Who feels bad for this chicken
That music...Mark Rober mk 2
This is just a weirder Mark Rober what a legend
Gives another meaning to be your meat......
He feels bad for this chicken
Imagine if you could really cook with just slaps. Our ancestors be slapping mammoths until they die lol
5:46 someone said something like the n word so that’s why there is a box
This is actual science
Davie504 would be proud
He has done it, he has started to believe
That is not a medium rare steak quit lying
Heavenly would be proud :D
The weary supermarket intrahepatically yell because success postmeiotically wash by a unarmed hygienic. selfish, tasty result
why don't you just use the heat from the motor while its slapping, so TECHNICALLY, slaps are cooking the chicken
You got nothing on Asian parents when thier child only gets an A, not an A+.
Why do you look like a nerdier ver of logic  Great vid btw
I like how he called it "meat beater"
That’s perseverance
Trying to get to 1k likes without a comment :)
Boi, he did it !!
Aside from the crust, that steak was cooked perfectly!
IT’S FUCKING RAW!
I'm more impressed by the 69420
How much do you have to rub a chicken to cook it?
Im going to slap the subscribe button till it Cooke's the screen
Imagine going to a restraunt and the waiter brings our a whole raw chicken. The waiter just slaps the chicken and leaves. The chicken is slightly overcooked
Lol the perfect sponsor
Best science on the internet hahaha   Making the structure that rigid pretty much guaranties something is going to break no matter what
What a madlad
"the original meat beater has a problem; it cant control the power"     the nut machine 9000 max vaccuum sealed pro model with surround sound
Madlad actually did it.
The madlad actually did it...
I want to try this concept
Is that what they call it these days? Slapping your chicken?
So...you're just a chicken slapper?
That's whole new level "I Like ya cut G" Only the victim would be on life support after.
I see slapping your chicken works... but what about choking it?... for science and all.
The prophecy has been fulfilled. The chicken has been successfully cooked
He basically cooked meat with kinetic energy
Now try it again with a chicken but alive.
Nobody:  Me at 3am:
I feel good that my shirt purchasing went to such a fantastic cause. The MeatBeater 9001 truly went above and beyond the line of duty in delivering unto us a cooked chicken with only the power of slappage.
This needs to be viral.
Lol. The meat beater.  🤣
Hehehe  Meat beater   Haahhhaaaa
You missed the perfect opportunity to title this video as " Beating the meat "
Can u cook a bread by slaps
YOU ABSOLUTE LEGEND YOU DID IT. looking forward to your next projects, you're my new favorite content creator
Somebody notify davie504
Kid: Did you cook your chicken? Louis: yes Kid: What did it cost you? Louis: My electric bill
it will be a very tender chicken
This takes beating your meat to another level. Yes this comment is a joke.
The real problem with the whole experiment was the lack of seasoning lol
So dope
Artificially create problems to make it more "interesting". DISLIKED THE VIDEO
Jello would be proud with this man.
Geez louis
im just going to say Mark Rober 2.0
It tenderized the steak too much?
So we can say this meat slaps.
slap happy hehehe
So he dosent cook a fucking chicken he cooks a steak???
Anybody else got that feeling at 69  👉👈
Kelvin is true science temperature measurement.
Fake
What if the microwave had never been invented and instead we all had slappers in our kitchens lol.
So how many slaps would it take  To make someone  thats ugly to hot
We fckin did it boyz
Tenderized and cooked at the same time
"Hell sir, I'll be your waiter today. Have you chosen what to order?"  "Hm, Chicken, Breast"  "Alright, how would you like your Chicken?"  "Well Slapped"
SCIENCE
Imagine if cooking things with slaps was the only way to cook on earth and humanity never came up any other way
Yoooooooooo this is sick
why did u copy mark robers theme song
Nobody   Boys when they turn 14:
Oh hey you did it.. glad to be back
He finally did it. But he didn’t even share the chicken with us. Wtf
Davie504 like that slap!
Wiat 60 degrees for 1 hour I thought
Is that real?
I live for these moments
MADMAN REALLY DID IT OH MY GOSH
YESSS
man, this guy made a invention to beat his meat, that is amazing. wait what...
the meat is beated
When I thought I'll never see the slapper again... You notifed.
Congratulations!!
Me : * casually looking for something to listen while trying to sleep * Youtube : hey you wanna see a guy build a machine that can cook a chicken by slapping it?..... part 2  Me : .... HECK YEAH I DO
This is peak engineering and  an affront to the culinary arts
Imagine if fire was not a thing and we cooked food by this technique
@davie504
This is fucking wild
my parents: **trying to sleep** me in my room at 2am:
I just remembered something and if u know, u know  Just a hint "Momento Mori"
I’m guessing no spices were used ? 😂
This entire channel is literally a cheap knockoff of mark rober
Holy shit he finally did it
Should have used davie 504 holy slap
You stole the music off of mark rober’s videos. Also
Tenderizing and cooking
I beat my meat, but I don't eat my meat.
Plot twist: some caveman 20,000 years ago slapped a chicken until it was cooker
technology advanced over thousands of years for us to get to this moment
Moral of the video: Violence is always the answer :)
HPC is here. I wonder if they can cook a chicken with their hydraulic press.
Types of meat cook: Grill it, Braise it, Stew it, Roast it, Broil it, Stir Fry it, Barbeque it, Oven it, Slap it.
I never expected to see a follow up after the meat beater 9000
HE FINALLY DID IT BOIS!!
Has science gone too far?
Science yall!
Blonde Mark Rober
Bro he did the impossible
So, does that mean my glitzy is cooked
Here before this video blows up again
you have made scientists proud and chefs sick
I remember reading something about how mongols would create a meal by wrapping a piece of meat in a piece of leather and then put it between the saddle and the saddle pad and then ride for the day and in the afternoon it would be ready. I wonder if this for of cooking is like that.
My checks must be burnt by now
Yes finally I've been waiting since the first vid
sorry you cooked it at 60 degrees sure you’re holding it at that heat for a while, essentially slow cooking it but everything about food safety training is screaming at this, 80 degrees is what kills any bacteria and is the legal minimum temperature for hot food storage/display in Australia You’d have to hold a high temperature in the chicken for a decent while, as holding it at 45 in a moist chicken couldn’t be a better environment to grow bacteria Everything about this screams sketchy
Is this proving what mark and Ethan did from unus annus?
I’m just shocked at the amount of patience this chat has
Should've just used a small piston and crankshaft setup, spin the crank with an electric motor and have the piston hitting the chicken, speed control and perfect control of slap force.
I subscribed because you actually listen to your fans in the comments. You just gained a new one
I love the internet
Somebody share this with Gordon Ramsay I want to see his reaction😂😂😂
That's how microwave works
Poor chicken, it got slapped lmao
Seems definitely kind of sus.
WE ARE WITNESSING HISTORY
the man has finally done it.. I'm so happy
Up next: slapping an egg until it’s hard-boiled
Damn that shit medium rare to perfection
*mashed chicken mr fry*
This may be sponsored by Hello Fresh, but that chicken sure aint fresh after this experiment
Lesson: don’t get to freaky in bed
watch him get food poisoning
🙃
"If you can get past the fact that the steak tastes absolutely terrible... Well... The steak tastes pretty good!"  In all seriousness, amazing engineering job.
send this to guinness world records RIGHT NOW
not the mark rober music
Imagine slapping Godzilla 💀
Get michael reeves
can't believe it took till almost the end of the video to recognize background. the difference sitting vs standing makes
I hope Guga Foods sees this
ah is this MiniMark Rober? i see
Absolute madlad
This guys, this is the future of humanity
Wants to cook a chicken by slapping at it, changes it to steak, eats basically a beef burger patty at the end. SUBSCRIBED.
1:55 ... what did I just see?  😳
It was too fast
He sits right in between Micheal Reeves and Mark Rober
Here before 1 millions views!
Chicken: Spank me daddy uwu     I-I am sorry..
Yah that chicken isn’t done. Knowledge is knowing a tomato is a fruit wisdom is not putting it in fruit salad...I wouldn’t eat that chicken.
Louis Weisz: Mark Rober Next Generation
"Excuse me, I ordered my steak an hour ago. Where is it?" "I'm so sorry sir, we're still beating your meat." "What?" "It's still on the slapper" "....What?"
This guy is the new Mark Rober. He explains the same and uses the same music.
cool but did i ask
Reminds me of my childhood
WHERE IS @DAVIE504 WHEN YOU NEED HIM?
im pretty sure "real science" uses Kelvin as temperature measurements.
So my life has come down to this .
Is this mark robers brother?      😂 😂 😂 The music and the facts
i watched the previous video literally yesterday lmao
Me watching this video: I gotta try this now  My imaginary schizophrenia powered girlfriend: H̵͓̆̔a̶̧̛̰̋h̷͍͘ã̵̟̠h̸͕͘͘a̷͎͝ ̶͖͚͝N̶̝͖̍̓ ̸̫̍O̸̡̬̎
Always remember to repent of your sins (sin is transgression of YAHUAH’S LAW: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, & Deuteronomy) And Have Belief On YAHUSHA HAMASHYACH. HE Died and Rose three days later so that you can be forgiven of your sins!   HE Loves you! Come to HIM!🙂🙂
I wonder how the vegans felt while watching this video
Song title at 8:55?
A man with the power of all human will burn the chicken with 1 slap
When the boys needed him the most, he came back 🍗👋🏻❤️
New speed sps replacing studs per second for slaps per second
my advice : just keep swimmin just keep swimming
1:05 I can’t believe he said that without laughing lol
Hello Fresh bulgogi is actually pretty fire after you add some sriracha
Let guga foods cook with it he'll make it good
Well, that's your new barbecue!
Just wait until this guy finds out how little gets you need to cook steak...
I think Mark Rober stole your intro music and narration style...
Am I tripping or was he at like 30k subs a few weeks ago
born too early for interstellar travel, born too late for dinosaurs, but born just in time for this
You forgot to add salt
"I'm just sayin, if physical energy can be turned into thermal energy, how hard would I have to punch a chicken to cook it"
Remember teens, this is what ya get when ya beat ya meat too fast.  *"IT GETS COOKED"*
I’ll buy the hello fresh if I can cook it by slapping
Can you do how hard you need to punch a chicken to cook it
Bruh 😂😂😂     I don't even have a comment for this one 😂
Honestly rather stick it in the oven
Davie504 approved the slap!
The madman did it
Why I hear Mark Rober Music? 1:40
wait.. so how many slaps
Very impressive, but can you slap a...  Wrong place
“The original meat beater” I think its called the hand
mom : what do you do nowadays in engineering? him: I slap chicken to cook it,  mom: O_O
A Whole New Way to Cook Chicken
The YT algorithm finally noticed you.
He did it bois…
Finally
Something that slaps better than Davie504?
Krl copiaram o balian
The next wave in culinary innovation; won’t be too long before you see MB9001’s in restaurant worldwide.
its finally done (what part was it done? since the first part i watched was 4? but i remember in 7 since thats the part where i was there)
dude is that the mark rober building montage music? nice
Introducing the rework for Way of the open palm
My god...
ooooo what hidden gem channel have I come across
Whats up slappers
This man can build a device that can cook food by slapping it, yet does not have access to metal silverware or anything beyond a paper plate.
Who else noticed pink panther in the back ground?
Of course it would be soft because you literally cooked it by tenderising it
thanks youtube for recommending
That's one way to beat your meat
So uh if you wanted to slap by hand...how many slaps would it take to cook a person? Asking for a friend.
This man turned from american to english damn
He did it...
Meat beater always gets me
Jesus loves u all so much
I'm here before 1M views
Wow cooking and tenderizing in one machine I’ll take your entire stock
A true victory steak.
Next: Trying to cook meat using a pc
I saw you fail, and i saw you succeeding.
A very interesting video
Chicken/poultry needs to be 75 Celsius or above
Claim you’re here before 1 million views ticket here
I’ve been waiting too long for this
Claim you’re here before 5 million views here
When I read the title I thought this was going to be a Davie504 video for a second.
This video is similar to mark robers videos cuz the music
God damn this video is perfect
no beating the meat jokes
Just when I thought the mad lad was done amazing content! 👏
I’m afraid of what you would’ve made if you had better equipment and materials for this project... in the future a restaurant that cooks food that’s been slapped
something tells me that chicken was in the temperature danger zone for far too long
But F° is the better standard cause it's American and US Americans are better
Congratulations, you invented cooking
It's back
legend you have finally did it
Most tenderized steak in the history of the whole god damn universe
'Ginereing
That steak stream was... something else xD
lmao is this the scionce music
Make a metal rig?
No way, XD
I’m honored to watch this
1:55
NOT THE MARK ROBER MUSIC IM DYING😭😭😭💀💀💀
I’m glad to see his channel grow
Did this guy seriously go full on science shit just to cook a chicken by slapping it?  U earned some respect
You finally fucking did it
I can die happy knowing the answer
*Sir, get me that machine* 😩
what song is at the beggining
Bro. Your issue is that the slapper itself doesnt hold heat at all. A board isnt anywhere near a hand, so if you made the slapper softer and able to emanate even a slight amount of heat, the chicken would cook way faster. TLDR: it takes less slaps to cook a chicken, provided you are slapping with a hand
Nice.
THIS WHOLE FUCKING PROJECT WAS SETUP FOR A HELLOFRESH AD WTF
After slapping the meat you gotta sear it.
This was the first video of Louis recommended to me and I wanna enjoy it but I just can't. His voice is too annoying for me that I had to just skip to the cooked part lmao. God I can't stand it.
@TheRussianBadger
Please, send this to Gugafoods
He actually did it 😯
Sous vide? More like Slap Vide.
Slap cooker
bruh patent this shit
Guaranteed fancy restaurants will use machines to slap cook their food and sell it at an astronomical price.
you should put a stick on the tip then it will finger the chicken LOL
I really need to pick up my kids now but I JUST CANT STOP WATCHING this is so fun lollllll
He actually did it omg
Finally the meme of the ages has been solved, by pure willpower and dedication.
Ah yes the meme version of Mark Rober
Now I dare to cook a chicken using cpu heat
Can you cook a monkey by spanking it
you absolute mad man you did it
This man deserves a million subs
Hello Fresh makes the blandest meals I’ve ever had the misfortune of tasting.
you will never be Mark Rober!
The power of S L A P S
This is how davie504 cooks all his food
MADLAD
I like the mark rover music.
You should cook bacon and eggs on the slapper
Talking about beat my meat 😂
Call linus he might make a custom water loop
Getting big Mark Rober vibes with the background music and style of the video lol
We need Gordon Ramsay to react to it.😂😂😂😂
This is gonna be in peoples recommendations for years to come.
If you slap it with a Bomb it will cook in 1 slap.
Yay just don’t say you beat your meat so hard that it cooked
Slap a chicken.
Hell yes chicken slappin returns!!
*Davie504 entered the chat*
The linked motor is a great idea! In these designs where there's an impact, I would have looked for inspiration in a hammer drill: there's a hammer and more importantly, a clutch like mechanism that disconnects the motor from directly experiencing the forces of the impact. Your design has a lot of lash, but lets be honest, its a comically accurate mechanical way of slapping a chicken :) thoroghly enjoyed this process
dude he literally beat his meat to cook it then he ate his beaten meat
but hello fresh is nowhere near as memeable or conversational as saying you cooked with slaps. you can literally say "damn, this steak slaps"
Science has gone too far.
The slapperwave. Slapped with flavor... SLAP like now for epic flavor
"Meat beater" lmao
nice
Mad lad
The future is her
"Your engineers were so wrapped up in wether or not they could, they neglected to wonder wether they should." We're gglad you did though.
this will go down in history, we may make a path of cooking with machines that slap things, and with more efficiency in almost everything, you may just have opened the door to the path
Me every 3 AM
Lemme Guess, You watched russain badger bout how you can cook Chicken By hitting it hard neough
I'm amazed by the fact that this guy improved his machine uncountable times, bought better parts, researched more and more, teamed with various other experient people and probably did something new on science, all to cook a chicken (and a steak)  Congrats, my man
History
Davie504 would be able to do it in one slap
Just one question..WHY!
mfs in december first be like:
U did it buddy, i'm proud of you
He actually did it
Chicken + Steak 🤔 Cheak or Sticken???
Jajajaja he is using Mark Rober’s music
ayyyyy finally!!
The day that I have been waiting for
Try making something which will vibrate the meat instead of slapping it. No impact damage and all the same kinetic transfer to thermal energy. Don't make a shaker. Specifically low oscillation high frequency vibration. That's right, a vibrator.
remember us when you blow up my guy
Bringing "this steak is slappin" to a real meaning 🤣🤣😂😂
Can you go to hell for this?
It’s a guy like this that gets hired at Tesla
Make this a commercial product
What did it take..... a lot of slaps
insert meme: who's ur daddy now
This explains why some girls ass looks cooked
haha, meat beater.
YOU WILL NEVER SLAP LIKE HOW TO BASICS NEVER! YOU HEAR ME WITH YOUR MONSTER MACHINE....
Thst stake doesn’t count. The whole reason it was so difficult was because it always broke, so by starting at 40 you totally cheated it.
what a time to be alive
slap? S T R O N ZO!
he did it
Gordon Ramsay would be proud
So what you gonna called the food? You know like rotisserie chicken
I just thought of something would it be possible to eat meat and chicken raw if there was absolutely no bacteria
An engineer mind can do anything
Unga bunga the 420th would be proud
Next MarkRober?
if still problems, you can put a target plate, metallic, inside the bag, to receive the hits
What about using a real material like steel.
holy shit he did it
Off brand mark rober lol
Very brave of you to say Hydraulic press channels idea was bad lol
Nobody: My dad on report card day.....: 2:42
There it is.
Here before 1 million views  Because ik this is gonna go viral
Fake !
I'm a bit curious about what are your neighbor think when you slap it at night, "damn, he plays more hardcore than s&m club"
LETS GO BABYYYY!
Me and my two braincells: ha meat beater
This guy reminds me of Mark Rober.
Boy cooked steak and put it in a bag
We did boys  We finally did it
We always see this mix up. Its not how many slaps, its how hard would I have to slap to cook it in only one slap
Me beating my meat be like:
your scientific facts about the chicken cook temp is cute... but my 13 years running kitchens proves you wrong... that's a great way to lose a ton of weight super fast though.
Shoutout to Skulker for first posing the question in therussianbadger's tactical fried chicken video.
inncorrect about metric real science if in farenheit metric has only been around for decades
Hell yea
Celsius used in *REAL SCIENCE*  Kelvin- Hold my bear!!!!!!
I been waiting for this!! anyone else?
The bag was my suggestion on the other video, not that you seen my comment lol. I’m a genius, I knew it.
This seems like a young mark Rober and much respect is all I have for him
there was the "giving head" part, lel
I want Gordon Ramsay to react to this
Chaos
Wow, first 5 seconds gives away the whole climax of the video.  Don’t even feel the need to watch the rest now lol
You should do anime
U need a circle slapper
Here take this “get recommended” ticket
call it anything else besides meat beater
This gave me a new meaning to “beating your meat”
nice
Can someone timestamp the finished products, not worth watching entire thing
Quality > Quantity
I think he meant "team of discord engineers on crack"...
I have school in the morning but seeing a chicken getting slapped to perfection is more important
So what if you made beef stock using slaps. It would probably tenderize out the sweet meaty juices into the broth, and with some seasoning, it could probably make an interesting soup base as anything else in there would probably be pulverized into the broth.
Next video-Slapping a live chicken till its cooked
We had a goal that we accomplish
I found my new tech channel (:
Finally
*BEAT-MY-MEAT-inator*
We are using science to do some crazy thing which doesn't have any reasonable to do still we are here , crazy people
This is the worst thing that I've every been excited to watch
The future is now. Hope NASA would consider to add this in the ISS
Bruh this guy just made a gaming chicken slaper 3000 with a cooler
4:52 Sam O'Nella?
@therussianbadger
Got to have that mark rober music tho right
The myth busters should be proud lol
This man is a legend He is the first man to cook his food by beating his meat
Gordon: loses brain cells
This takes “beating your meat” to a whole new level      ;)
Welcome to slap city wait am I allowed to say tha- *this comment has been deleted due to copyright issues*
You did it You did it you crazy son of a bee
I guess you could say that he beat his meat        ;)
It both cooks and tenderizes!
Where this guy work?, because i see a old video, where he is working in a giant garage with other people.
i clicked on this cause of unus annus
I see covid is driving people crazy...
I wonder how many bees does it need to cook a chicken
Jesus will you season that meat before cooking it...
Who else watched the final chicken slapping stream?
This is my mother to me whenever I make the rice to soft.
I think a steam engine slapper is better for a outdoor wooden camping
You sound EXACTLY like Morty, while acting like Rick... Fan theory, check
*Kiara when phoenix*
Yo I watch the og when this showed in my recommended I poged
You made a working slapanator 9000?
I’m glad geuce can get his chicken cooked by punching it
We're making history bois
"C"
you should hook the slapper to an exercise bicycle.
my faith in humanity is partially restored
You sir, are king of the crazies. Long live the king.
I don't remember asking.
Why in TF am I watching this
"Hey did you see that funny meme about cooking a chicken by slapping it?" "Meme?" Sees this video: "Hol up, what?"
See you in 20 years, when the kids in the future will think that we're a bunch of silly guys.
You forgot to credit the originators of this challenge: Mark & Ethan, coowners of *Deleted Channel*
My mom used to use this machine on me
69420 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣💀 I love this channel
Ok its cooked but did it kill the salmonella ?
Imagine if early humans cooked food by slapping it for hours
Sorry, I just can’t help but laugh when he refers to it as the “meat beater”.
Judging by the shirts, you must be a fan of skateboarding. When are you getting a street part?
Ah man, slappy slappity
He's done it!
This guy gives me the next mark rober vibes
The madlad did it
Now where we can order this slaptastic chicken
*gasp * A RICE COOKER! UNCLE ROGER APPROVE
This guy is the Steven hawking of microwaves, Brilliant!
Awesome video!
Gotta love the LTT Blowie Matron
We have reached the peak of Human Achievement, well done!!!
I gonna buy this so I can cook someone ass...
And I present to you the meat-beater
Why don’t you make the bottom vibrate, use a bowl with a hole for the stick for pulp, and just use a vibrating stick? Thermal covering to keep chicken heat, oil or something, metal bottom.
offbrand mark rober, the music, the dumb (but funny) machines, etc.
NOBEL like to know your location
Animal abuse...
OMG I remember now that when I was a kid they told us at school that the Huns used to put bags of raw meat under their horse saddle when they rode out, and by the time they got to wherever they were going the meat would be cooked. And I remember I used to think buuuuullshit, but this kinda proves it's completely plausible.
Good video 👍👍
i can hear him now       hello guys this is daily dose of internet
Cant believe you did this !   I really enjoyed watching the livestream !  Even when it didnt work !
Peter sripol?!!!
Science at its finest
this guy produces just like Mark Rober, i love it
Im glad ive been here for a super long time
I could cook a turkey using my cube😭😭😭
#mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
"Measured in Celsius degree... That's the scale used for real science"  sad Kelvin noises

Chicken: "Beat my meat, human!"  Louis: yes
Slapped into submission, consumed without hesitation. Long live the slapper

Okay, this has to be a significant scientific breakthrough
I'll just use an oven, thanks for the tip tho
Engagement
Was that peter sripol?
“The original meat beater”
Unnus and Annus would be proud.
This is going to replace coal before we even notice

This man is going full Mark Rober XD
When people use Mark Rober music you know they are serious🤣
Davie would approve this
Ready set.. beat your meat
You definitely earned my subscribe

He didn't gave up OP🔥🔥🔥
He’s DONE IT!

Beat that meat. I'm sorry.
Dude u  literly just cooked a steak with a tenderizer
This is the Einstein of our day
Hello welcome back
He’s done it
Mark Rober type beat
Someone needs to send this video to The Russian Badger, Jello now has his answer.
Dude, what the hell? You celebrate 69420 slaps, but not 42069 slaps??
Ok good approach. However you could get the boys over and make a rhythm and slap that meat
Is this mark robers son?
This man bout to have salmonella
Oh my god he did it.
I been waiting for this video
Congrats my man. You have been in this project for so long. ✊✊
THE LEGEND DID IT
But can it S L A P T H E B A S S ?
This is why you turn on notifications on this channel
Alright, so, when's the restaurant grand opening? 🤣
When you try to beat your meat as fast as possible
The next air fryer
This could be an episode on How I met your mother 😂 to celebrate slapversary
And I thought covid would be the most historical event to happen in my lifetime
Next.  cook it by chocking it. Lol😂🤣😂
life changing
Science may be done in Celsius but cooking is more commonly done in fahrenheit. I demand a recount!
cool, now cook popcorn
Moms: *Can i buy that machine*
Fake?
Hi Joel said I should comment
This dude did not give up making this
a brazilian youtuber already made a video before this one, the channel id balian
Celsius is the brits way of trying to take back America... and you kneeled
You mad lad...you actually did it...
Yes this is amazing I have been watching every single video
Finally, good job bro. 👍
The mark rober music lol
OMG HE FINALLY DID IT!!!!!!!!
How much would I have to pay you to make and mail me one of those
This man's facial expression is dead
It's crazy how he has less the 350k subs. He's been making videos for a while and they're all great, only a matter of time till he blows up
My man just got called out by Gordon Ramsay just for science.
Me a weeb   *ZA WARUDOOOO TOMARE TOKIWO...MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDAAAAA*
If you can open a restaurant that sells slapped steaks, you'd make at least...$100.
omg he just cut a cutting board
This gives a new meaning to “beating your meat”
one slap next?
holy COW
Imagine if you could patent the machine used to cook.
You actually did it congrats
Imagine living as a chicken and then being cooked like this
Heeey yooo I'm actually from the future like if I tell you I'd have to ....ykyk anyways I came here to tell you your about to get millions of views 🤪 bye leme go back to when covid is over
I'd dont know who you are,  I dont know how you got in My reccomended,  BUT I WANT *M O R E*
Bro why didnt he just enchant it with fire aspect
It smells like shhhhhhhhhhhi
How does this man not have 1 Million subs yet?
Now the question is if you can cook a chicken by vibrating it
So how hard would I have to punch a chicken to cook it again?
I would have done a wheel with multiple paddles fun video
6:39 me when I'm bored 😅
I wonder how many chickens he bought just to do this...
I see you went for the Mark Rober music, excellent choice
you guys need to invest in safety goggles.
Ancient people : slapped their chicken to cook
Missed opportunity to say "I like your cut G"
cook a chicken by raosting it
*S L A P*
So this guy just tried to find a way to say the chicken was cooked, even though it’s just barely cooked cause his machine couldn’t last long enough to cook the chicken to 175F so he bitched out to do less cause it would be easier. Nah man that’s defeat
This is what I call "quality content"
This is what happens when you beat your meat
Davie504 is gonna be happy about this.
I was here. Poggers
I’m so glad to have been here while history was made
Just finished the last video
I remember this thing a few months ago
“The original Meat Beater” - Some Youtuber in my recommended
Nice Mark Rober music
Rip Draco, literally first one to attempt commenting the funny number and he had a typo
Thats baked
He's actually done it, should one mortal be allowed to wield such power
What if you connected the rig to a 212cc engine?
dang dude you can fly I watched your original video on this nice work on this
Yo you can't just use the same music mark Rober uses big dawg. Even if it is royalty free nonsense lol
I am really glad that I found something in celcius instead of Fahrenheit. This is the first time I don't have to do (5/9)F-32
The iconic Mark Rober music at 1:08 tho
SEASON YOUR MEAT! my culinary brain hates your unseasoned meat!
WOOOOOOOO WE DID IY
Unus annus had nothing on him....
He can actually and factually say that his cooking slaps
You do realize this isn't gonna end until you slap a meal together and eat it too. I'm talking chicken, potato's, vegetables, it's all gotta be in there
Lol meat beater🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
that is truly insane
It should be cook to 162°F to be safe
The mad man finally did it
You've just earned a sub
1:02 when he said rigidity I thought he said “virginity” 😂😂😂😂
Just set the whole thing on fire
Beat meat then eat
AJUSTABLE SLAP DEPTH 🤣
LETS FUCKING GOOOOO 69420
A titanium pole dropped from an orbiting satellite can release the same thermal and explosive energy as the Hiroshima bomb when it finally hits the ground... 'Rod From God'.

Me when I’m alone 😈
This guy is lying. I've never met him before in my life let alone gave him instructions on how to slap meat.
The Mark Rober music background makes it 5x better
Gf : babe, what you doing? Me : slapping my meat
Mark Rober music?
AASKJDHALSKJDH HE USED THE MARK ROBER MUZAK
You cooked it    Rare?
You did it!
This should go in school textbooks for science class
MY MANS STOLE MARK ROBERS BEAT
"Meatbeater9000." Nice😏

Now that you used Celsius, I'll sub.
see you guys in another 5 or 10 years  when you see this in your reccommend.
Yeee i wayched the old video months ago hell yeee
I think the lesson in this is build it right the first time.
Youtube... I never knew I needed this video
LIES THIS CANT BE REALITY  AAAAAAAAAHHHHhhh...
1 slap from mom and I cooked steak. One is enough!
Now see how much force it takes to cook it in one slap
Yoo
God damm you beautiful bastard, you did it.
why
You did it? Louis: Yes! What did it cost? Louis: Everything!
Aerogel is essentially just very not-dense foam, right? It's like 99% air? How did the slapper not just pulverize the aerogel layer into nothing?
So is it cooked without the maillard reaction? Doesn’t that ruin the taste
Lol
All of those chickens that died just to be slapped to a pulp
That's nothing you should see me when my parents were out of the house as a teenager lmao
Slapp dat meat!   Slapp
“taste the meat, not the heat”
Is that SRIPOL????
Very cool! Please do more Minecraft recipe videos
Dude your the next mark rober
Ancient greeks calculating the circumference of the earth just by counting their steps: "I wonder what great things humans will achieve in the future as tools become more advanced" Humans in the future: "*slaps chicken* this baby can hold a lot of degrees Celsius"
Take a shot every time he says " LETS GO"
If you call that chicken cooked then I am the president
If he is able to cook meat by beating so does this mean I was cooking my meat this whole
this man took "beating my meat" to a whole new level😂😂
I should be doing my geometry homework, but this is a far greater issue

In resume: Professional meat beater.
Yeah i remember this guy He is the guy who make medieval chainmail and the video is underrated😂 Good job bro!!
kid in 2050:mom im hungry   mom:ok let me turn on the slapper
is it just me of is this guy like the morgz of mark rober
Cook one with a 3090
Now do it with an alive one
Have you tried choking the chicken to heat it up
This video is peak YouTube rabbit hole
did you salt any of these meats? Would that impact thermal properties. It would definitely improve the final product
Wait I never knew this DOES he work in the same shop as petersripol
That's so awesome bruv, proud you got here mang
Dis is the behind slapper :)
Mark rober music in the background

He is beating his meat again
Why do I feel like I'm watching a mark Rober vid lmao
Minecraft fire aspect
Congrats man
this is important
Can I order slapped chicken/steak through hello fresh?
That’s a cop-out. You didn’t season it or eat it.
why do i hear Gordon Ramsay saying in the background, "it's f*cking raw!"
My mom would love this machine
who cares about watching the video, where can i get one
look at this lazy millenial, back in my day I cooked all my steaks with my own hands furiously beating down on one of the family cows, I didn't need some fancy machine to do it for me
Missed opportunity should have said “it slaps”
Uhhmmmm fake??
The power of Slap
Couldn’t watch till 11 pm because I was going back to Ohio from Kentucky because my cousin
You got to make it as stable as a bridge.
How to cook it you ask? 74°C until it smokes      Or you can just slapes it 135.000
Wasn't this started by russinbadger and his friends as a joke
i can cook chicken in my gpu
If you didn’t understand much of what he said don’t worry you just simply can’t explain slaps without slapping your hands
Davie504: OwO  Slappers 👋🖐
the legend RETURNS
Wait you Actually did it?
that Mark Rober music,    love it
[redacted] must be quaking in their boots right now.
The legend is still trying to cook a chicken by slapping it
I accidentally overcooked my meat while watching some *Researching stuff*   I slapp it so hard it got burnt.
2:49 excuse what did you say
Seeing the steak come out brown and juicy was wild
i also i have meat beater but its doesnt cook chicken it relief stress
I got the Mac now where’s the cheese-
Im glad u make video for us BUT MAN HOW MUCH MONEY U SPEND?
That is alot of electrocity waste just to cook a chicken
he really sounds like mark rober sometimes
Meet beater?
i want a meal cooked with slaps
The next mark rover...
69,420 slaps... nice
Fake
Imagine this gets to the news "guy cooks a chicken by slapping"
This video answered a question that kept me up nights
My god, he actually did it.... The crazy son of a b*tch actually did it!
Just be honest, is it fake?
jebac disa
Meat beater nine thousand pause
that thing beats its meet almost as fast as i do

God i wish that was me
Am I the only one who heard him call it a MEAT BEATER
when will Mark Rober enter the chat??
Wait dint you have like 10k like month ago???
OH MY GOD YOU MADLAD YOU ACTUALLY DID IT
I saw the title, you have a new subscriber
I was there for the first attempt (up to 48 C) Didn't manage to catch the final victory because of school. :(
Why not pneumatic??
No way, this is history being made in youtube. wow, I actually can't believed you cooked a chicken by slapping it
Wait 'til this video gets million views
Is this from Geuss quote "If physical energy can be converted into thermal energy, how hard to I need to punch a chicken to cook it" oh god
Why does my work ( McDonalds ) require 360°F for our fried products? Theres a difference huh? Im cooking this in oil.... Idk
yooo, he got a stattrak meat beater 9000? damn, lucky man!
3:32 *nice*
This is going to be a new kind of cooking channel where he cooks everything via slaps
Maddest of mad lads
You should've called davie504
Finally history has been made🥳🥳🥳🥳
I did it to!!!! I slapped it....... in the oven! 🤣🤣
make fire by slapping
Im so happy to eat something off the slapper ~ Louis Weisz 2021
The madman actually did it. Wtf man, that's top tier dedication right there
i wish my meat beater had those problems....beating the chicken would be on a whole nother level. Id love to beat my chicken so hard my meat beater just disintegrated.....
We found it, boys. We finally know how many slaps it takes to cook a chicken.  135000 slaps.
Hello fresh. Honestly sucks. Good ingredient ideas. But actually very poor ingredient quality when it shows up. Im a professional chef of over 10 years. Hello fresh sucks. Good recipies shitty food quality. Vegitables always show up on the verge of going bad. Are unappealing visually. The instructions a lot of the times are absolutely nonesense. And the 4 peraon meals honestly only feed 2 people a full meal. I have 3 kids. And just me and my gf. We have to use two 4 people meals everytime and still sometimes have to add in extra ingredients. Which literally defeata the whoke purpose of using their service.
the return of the king
He finally did it. I’m proud. 👏
Hes like Mark Rober
Unus Annus would be damn proud
Im a simple man i see a weird tittle, i click.
He finally did it.
*Vince Offer sometime in the near future.....* : “you remember the slap chop???? Well now I present to you..... *THE SLAP COOKER!!!* Now with *30%* more slap!!!!!”
davie liked this video
need A1
Ummmmmm... this kinda blew my mind :D
people before fire
Did you want the chicken tender or pulverized
Nice
Unus an- I mean Mark and Ethan tried to do this
This is a video for smart guys not for me im to dumb for this
7:49 me at a restaurant

"this time I measure temperature in degree Celsius......" Me proceeds to like.....
ok
AND ITS ON MY BIRTHDAY TOO!
*Meat Beater* 9000
This is what Unus Annus wanted to achieve
Goodbye Microwave, Hello MeatBeater9001
now it's time to go to the next level, choking the chicken to cook it. (depending on the methods used to choke the chicken, a lot of heat can be generated, i'll leave that to your imagination).
Why is he beating his meat
Bruhhhhhh I do not know Celsius
That must be some tender chicken 😂
Discount mark rober is that you?
Thumbnail was deceptive.
Slapping is now a method for cooking chicken
It should be better if you using wheel method?right?
MMMMMMMM FLAT CHICKEN
next time use a v8 engine
Ok, but how many chickens does it take to cook a slap?
This is the type of science experiments that truly matters
If Mark Rober  worked for Popeyes instead of NASA.
cave man hits rocks. makes fire to cook the chicken.  louis hits the chicken to actually cook the chicken
why didn't he just connect a V8 to the slapper?
This is like a clicker game
I'll keep the sponsor in mind for my college years
"How would you like your steak, Bond?" "Slapped, not seared"

This is stupid, post more please.
These guys are really good at beating their meat!
Congrats! You're the _first_ ever human to eat thoroughly slapped meat!
SLAPP LIKE NOW! :)
oh no so many 10 year olds are gonna be screaming at you for "copying" mark robers song
*Happy Davie405 Noises*
I started this video around the time I started my science project that's due tomorrow.  This is more important.
1:56 looks like the meat beater worked🤣
Have u thought about making an oven that is heated by slaps and cooking something inside of that
This is what we need to be testing instead of medical care
Raising or lowering the chicken would have been easier, great video tho this is a revolutionary idea I cant wait till my air fryer is replaced by a slapper.
Wow peter was there xD
9:52 This steak is steak
Everyone is gangsta until you realize that he is technically defiling a corpse
The only channel that can make me feel smart while watching a machine repeatedly slap a raw chicken
Now PETA can't sue me for slapping my chicken for 135, 000 times.
The screeching idiots demanding he do the video in celsius... god they're annoying
This man deserves a medal
Man you really made this a Mark Rober video.
Now do ham
for efficiency just use the oven but for entertainment go ahead use the slapper
Millennias worth of human innovation and technological advances has converge and led up to this moment of space and time: a video of cooking a chicken by slapping it
*They called me a madman*
Thanks now I can cook human affected and have fun
Holy crap, he cooked a chicken by slapping the hell out of it
we have witnessed history
People who complain about him using Fahrenheit are losers.
How long till this gets copywrited for using Mark Roberts music
Whats the song at 1:30
Yeeaaahhhhhhhh way to gooooooooooooooo ❤️.
It’s funny that the steak isn’t more cooked on one side, on the side that been tapped but perfectly cooked on the outside and pink in the inside...
Engineering and Science = BREAK EVERYTHING until you eliminate all the weak links and nothing else breaks.
I’m studying to be an aerospace engineer, this had inspired me to cook a chicken with jet fuel on a hot summer’s day
Now here is an even bigger challenge. Now we know that it takes approximately 135,000 slaps and nearly 7500 watts in electricity to power the slaps. How much chicken would you need to eat to power 135,000 slaps to uncooked chicken that will be cooked?
9:27 that's me :D
Davie504 would love this!!!
I did the same thing to my johnson. Surgery tomorrow wish me luck.
"The original Meat Beater" words of a legend
True science
Congrats!
You absolute mad man. Congratulations
Meat beater 9001 🤣
To think all this work and effort was because of a stupid video from the channel [REDACTED].
Jesus christ put some salt on it man
IT PISSES ME OFF HOW MANY CHICKENS HE FUCKING WASTED ITS A SHAME
You actually did it!
he took beating his meat to a whole other level.
Boys during puberty be like: the meat beater
Is it just me or is he starting to sound like Mark Rober ?           Like with the music and stuff ?
Well boys, we did it
Where can you buy one
glad you did it. Last video had left me with the question .
I love your videos!
Now do it in one slap.  CNN: Youtuber Builds nuke to slap a chicken. Tonight at 9.
"I wanted more than anything to eat a meal cooked from the power of slaps"  I don't know about you, but that sounded weird.
You know mans is serious when you got that mark rober music.
Chaotic good mark rober
I felt like the weird side of pornhub was probably taking notes.
that was most definitly rare steak just with a really brown crust area
2:43 What the hell is one C? 4:17 First off, thanks for a conversion. Secondly HOLY HELL. 4:35 Thank you for another conversion. 4:40 Another conversion for my F° American brain. 7:50 This dude has some great perseverance and conviction.
I like how technoblade was in his recommended
You know the guy means business when he has mark rober music
Now make it torture machine
why do i feel like im watching mark rober
Why is Mark Rober slapping a chicken?
0:57 HE STOLE THE MARK ROBER MUSIC
This is the peak of youtube. It's all down from here.
ohhhhh noice!!!! good job 😊👏
Maybe not leave the room to sub the real cooked meat just a word of advice this shit looks fake as f***
wtf am I wathching and why am I subscribing?
mark rober 2.0
This is taking beating meat to a whole new level.
hey thats mark robers soundtrack im suing
It's totally ironic for the people saying Celsius is used for real science. Because the funny thing about it is every scientist who's ever used Celsius automatically converts that number into fahrenheit in their head🤣. It turns into a thing where in order to understand Celsius you first have to understand fahrenheit. Making Fahrenheit the main scale and temperature whether you like it or not.
girls during puberty: 9:37   boys during puberty: 3:26
This is how microwave cooks.... But at a very very faster rate
Are you copying mark rober i noticed the music
You should slap it to 69C 😂
You could’ve done this so much easier, all you needed was an Italian mother and the chicken would cooked in 3 whacks
My online class is about to start, but this video seemed more important
Gordon Ramsey: the hell
Ok question. . . *WHY* ?
Not him using the mark rober song in the background-_-
This dude: They called me a madman
I think you should send your machine to Davie504. You will probably get a friend for live. 😉
Davie504 needs this machine XD
Nice job that was one well slapped chicken
There's a dish in the northern Island of luzon called "Pinikpikang" manok which  Literally translates too slapped chicken. I think the only difference is there they slapped the chicken to cause bruising and blood which , according to the locals, make the dish taste better. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWvRZA4jzpg
This video absolutely *slaps*
Don't know about others but this bgm reminds of Mark Rober!!
Very disappointing ending. All of a sudden you stop trying and just say, YES we did it, remember that shatty attempt a week ago, we did it!!! LAME AS EFF...
You mad lad, you did it
talk english fool typo lol me too but u  are to much fool
Achievement Unlocked: Superb Slapping Slap a chicken fast enough to cook it
Just imagine reading a recipe and it says "set MeatBeater to 135,000 slaps."
I can still see the naughty word you tried to censor around the 5:45 mark. Hopefully YouTube's algorithm doesn't see it. :/  Just trying to let you know.
Chick-fil-A: I'll take your entire stock.
*mark rober music activates*
Y E S
Last
Honestly if you reverse seared the steak it would probably be not half bad
oh wow
this machine beats meat with some heat
Is this the New Mark Rober
So if a vegan started to beat his meat would he still be a vegan
damn, some good stuff.
LoL this was great thank you internet for being scientifically silly
You, my friend, will be remembered as the greatest inventor of the 21st century.
you must post  the entire vods to this chicken slappity process
This is why I subscribed for!
The original meatbeater ahahahahah
🤚➡️🐔
what if u make a circle with 5 people, circular slap
you´re late man
Wtf have I stumbled upon....
this meme went too far
sorry but, a brazilian youtuber have done it yet his name is BALIAN
Honestly cannot believe the dedication
5:47 you may want to block more of the text
Finally
Could have doubled the rate by having a multiple slappers like easily do 2 so when one is up the other is down. sure you could also done something with gear ratios as well as would have adjusted like not have it raise so high up. Also I would go with more power but do something with the impact side not make it rigid either with the surface material or what connected it to the rod. Anyways the chicken is way thicker. and smart to not eat chicken that is not cooked. Im sure the 40c for the steak was no coincidence that's what rare is.
Mark Rober wannabe!

Seen the title and immediately thought Russian badger
SLAAPP
lol i came from a video of a dude checking ice thickness that was in my recommended. Now im watching someone slap a chicken... i love youtube
Am I the only one that realized the background music is the same as some of Mark Rober's videos
Adam Goldberg as an adult.
Nice background music
He's doing God's work
*Gordan ramsay wants to know your location*
I remember a russianbadger video where this was a joke, but YOU HAVE EXCEEDED EXPECTATIONS
Love the Mark Rober music
Estoy antes de que salga en Un Poco De Todo 😎
Mans here with the mark rober music, he does good
I first thought I was watching Mark Rober with the music used for science-y stuff
Yo, how did you get the marsyard 3.0s?
Mom: cook dinner me: aight  mom: what are you doing in there i told you to cook dinner me: i am  mom: what is that sound? me: beating my meat *litterallly beating my meat to cook it,*
This channel is mix of the king of random and mark rober.
Moral of the story: The real question is not how many slaps does it take to cook a chicken but rather, what does it take to cook a chicken by just slapping
Im having an exam right now and I'm just watch someone cooking a chicken by slaping it.
“Basically tastes like you’ve been chewing it for a minute”  _Or yknow... 6-8 hours_
yo someone get russian badger
Vasily would be able to achieve that.
you should have seasoned it first
comment for the algorithm
How many gentle finger pokes to cook a steak
@gugafoods
Man I don't even wanna tell people about this anymore because their too "cooked" to even believe me yet me slapping them 🙃 because they are cooked     In reality I am cooked and never slapped anyone over a video lol
you did u finnaly did
you should try to do it without the slapper
I WAS THERE
Really science uses Kelvin.  Celcius is lame.  Fahrenheit is cool.
We need more troll science like this. Random bullshit for the lulz. This is what will propel us to the stars.
Imagine going from based Fahrenheit to cringe Celsius
Unus annus is shaking
But what if. Mark rober collabed a vid with him... fixing global warming with one piece of ice
RIP chicken beaten even when dead
How even this thing is possible?
a burger wouldve been easier
sick!!!!
After he conceded that he you can't cook a chicken with slaps, he goes ahead to do it later. Sheer will at it's finest
Heck yeah, chicken slap squad
Music at 8:30?
NO FUCKING WAYYYY
Why do I leave comments every where and its just me saying something about anime girls or disagreeing with people
You have made the most expensive cooked chicken in the world.
Michael Reeves has his tazers Mark Rover has his anit-theft box William Osman has a battle bot And he has a robot that can cook chicken by slapping the sh*t out of it
You’ve probably got this advice, but you could’ve made a few interchangeable parts for the meat beater.
basically cooking the chicken Sous Vide with extra...slaps
Thats the most sophisticated chicken f- _wait can’t say that here..._
Great. but what if you need to cook a chicken and  lost your slapper? Can you cook a chicken by fapping?
1:56
sure
This man took the term “beating meat” to a whole other level...
didnt know you work with peter shripol
what the hell
You finally did it! Man, this has been the best internet thing I've seen in a long time. Thank you for the lols.
Slaps better than Davie504
So you're saying we can kill bacterias by slapping it?
you work too much on slapping chicken you should work now in diiffirent video
Dang from below 50k sub a month past 370k dang that slapping chicken really boom! Noice contect💖
You did it!!! This was an awesome trip and your truly awesome for taking on this entire slap cooking a chicken,,I'm glad I was able to watch the entire process.
He did it, he finally did it
I'd appreciate you lay off mark rober's music
I can’t believe I watched BOTH videos and he never told us where we can buy a Slap-Cooker™
This guy  is like real life Senku
He didn’t even season anything
You did it! Good job bro
Something with that texture, I'd probably go for a burger.
When it went over 9000.  I knew it it would work.
I've seen 2 streams half way can't believe you actually finished the project
this man is scuffed mark rober lmao
I feel like I'm part of a revolutionary milestone
About time we found a result from this
Didn't you have like 6k subs when you started this? Nice work, so glad to see you get paid to beat meat.
What a mad lad
Sous vide is so 2018, SLAP VIDE is the future.
Congrats dude. Definitely anticipate this channel getting big soon.
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES
This journey has been amazing thank you for your determination!!!
*You  can't cook a chicken with a slapper you DONUT!*
He's a fucking hero
Breaking the record at beating meat! Lets go!
cook hello fresh with the meat beater.
I have been spamming the servers I'm in with your progress. Today I can show them victory 🙌
the cooking community is going to advance
I dont really care if it get cooked or no but what i love is the resilience and dedication of this guy💪you motivate me ma mannn❤
*literally beating the steak to death with the worlds biggest meat tenderizer*  “That looks soft, it’s soft”
the chat:  *B E A T  T H E  M E A T*
Coc beat
you absolute mad man
Im'a slap you till you're well-done boy!
Ngl, started laughing when he said “meat beater”
Achievement unlocked "S L A P".
Send this to Davie504
I’m getting Mark Rober vibes. He’s even got the music.
Another reason for heating meat is is the Maillard reaction.
Awesome bro congrats. We slapping turkeys next
The mongols would put raw meat under their horses saddle and it would be edible after riding for a day or 2.
The internet is a dangerous place.     The internet:
*"the meat-beater 9,001"*
Meat cooked by the power of muda muda muda
Bruv
Pog
BEAT THAT MEEEAAAT!!!
No one: The chat: BEAT THAT MEAT
0:56 you know he's about to start spittin facts when the Mark Rober music starts playin.
To prevent overheating in future chicken slapping endeavors, use compressed air instead of electric motors.  Air tools like nail guns and grinders and such actually cool themselves off with use and the compressor is made to run all day.   A modified air tool would probably work well.
Moral of the story, if you want to cook chicken with slaps, all you need is just 2 nuclear reactor and solid tungsten and titanium
Sir, it’s been an honor
Wow
He’s a budget mark rober
Its not about the force of the slaps ITS THE FRICTION USE THE FRICTION MAN
attach a flesh light to it and you got your first buyer.
! Will you open a restaurant
When the world needed him the most       He returned
so pretty much he was desperate for eating something that was a product of beating the meat.
We did it bois, we have beat the meat
BEAT MY MEAT TO GIVE IT SOME HEAT
Lol
You just got everyone to watch you beat your meat for over 13 min
I finished binging your channel a while ago and I'm ready for more!
But how many slaps would it take to bake a cake
Missed opportunity not saying "This sh*t slaps" when taking a bite out of that steak.
its cold a meat beater
Woohoo!
Ive been waiting
Davie504 absolutely needs to see this. The power of slap is real, bro :D
Damn, This is lit 🔥
In the Philippines, we actually had a dish called pinikpikan which involves just hitting a native chicken endlessly till there is bruises all over the chicen
Fahrenheit is a perfectly acceptable measuring system and in some cases is better.  Everybody who says otherwise is a snob or europhile.
6:14 classic midwest "ope"
Peter Stripol just casually shows up in the video.

well THERE'S ur problem
This is crazy, one of the most legendary internet questions. Thank you reddit, thank you r/theydidthemath, thank You Luis
I think that the most expensive thing was the chickens
2021 redemption arc confirmed
Did you actually design the machine using paint?
Casually rocking mars yards
This man is the most wanna b mark rober I’ve ever seen
Bruh just use the microwave
he beat his meat
A 13 minute video about how you made a machine to beat your meat, but you could just go online and buy one off of Adam and Eve.
Celsius is real science  Me, who always had and always will use U.S.: Hold my beer
Isn't that the Mark Rober music?
we made history😩
that chicken BUSSIN
I saw the thumbnail and got so happy. Congrats, dude
I want to congratulate the absolute madlad that got into the video with that wall of text saying "Jebać Disa" at 9:20
Today, you become an internet's legend. Welcome
6:06 Ohh, thats why the workshop is familiar
The subject of this video would make an excellent conversation starter.
This is america-donald glover
I work at a meat shop him explaining cooking things lower for longer is how my boss explain his process to me and probably why he’s won awards
So cool to see this amount of collaboration just to beat meat.
you gotta season that shit
Never watched one if your videos before. But I'm subbed now. This is amazing.
I like the thought of him literally spending 2 months straight without break just making this work
So what you're saying is... the Flash could cook his meals by slapping them?
Imagine if he was doing something useful with his time! Reasons why humankind is so far behind.
Imagine being born as a chicken then dying and watching your dead body getting slapped into food from the after life
I believe the Huns ate their meat after sticking it between their saddle and the horse and riding on top of it.  Maybe that was also cooking it?
Goddamit louis how many times have i told you to use the olive oil 😡
You unlocked a new way of cooking
Ok where can I buy one
Dayum! Next video idea: How many shakes does it take to boil a bottle of water. On my high school physics test, I think I calculated some 170,000 shakes in a "Perfect" thermos.
I'm here before milions of views and I loooove your channel
2:15 I thought it was kelvin???
bro  that steak is raw
Ait I'm building a meat beater
ORA ORA ORA ORA that chicken.
Little mark Rober
"If physical energy can be turned into thermal energy, then how hard do I need to punch a chicken to cook it?"  -Jello
So glad I was on this journey
*OH HELL YEAH*
Commenting so the algorithm shows everyone this dumb shit
Davie504 and Vasily are proud of you
"I'll slap you so hard, you can cook chicken with it"
*BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRr*
When Mark Rober had a son:
That's one way to beat your meat
My man used science to beat his meat lmao
the “meat beater”
4:54 boom slow cooking, yes, it’s a thing.
beautiful
I feel like your mark rober but with stupid (not stupid as In dumb but stupid as in funny stupid) and funny ideas
gordon ramsey : confusing noise
Sous Vide Chicken  Also  FULL BRIDGE RECTIFIEEGERRERE?!???!?!
why didnt u just do rubber hands on a wheel
are he and peter sripol roommates or something
Idk about yall but i got weird vibes off this maaan
I'm getting Mark Rober vibes from this
I mean lag sober (mark rober)
YOU FINNALY DID IT
Ok mark Roger
Madlad finally did it!!! One of the humanity achievement!!
Epic.
FINALLY
imagine dying for that
"Grilled, baked, or fried?" "Uh slapped" "What?" "You heard me"
With that music in the beginning it really felt like I was watching a mark rober vid
The part two I didn’t know I needed
He did it. It's been 2 months. The world discouraged him, but he did it.
"Meat Beater 9,000"  *_Ah yes, truly the peak of science_*
Wait this actually worked
when I laughed at "meat beater" i realized how immature i still am
Russian badger fans unite
Good job *beating that meat*
Wahey well done! 🤟🏻
You will see these in posh french restaurants everywhere.
Me when im left alone for 0.0001 seconds
Wait is that the mark rober playlist, That’s illegal
Stupid YouTube I wanted to know when he did it! But seriously I'm so happy that we finally come completed the mission and put the myth to rest at last
OH MY GOD HE FINALLY DID IT
"put your pp in there and you got a automatic meat beater"                                           -someone from live yt chat
Human Society owes you:)
The madlads actually did it, I'm amazed
grab me that chicken slapper
Great video! My one suggestion would be not to use Mark Rober music, you want to create your own brand and find s song people can connect your channel too instead of using one that already has been used so many times by another similar creator
I mean...Steak ain't shit to cook.
where badger he needs to see this NOW
Good job! Louis
Meat Beater 9001...  And I'm here with a *Meat Beater XP*
Remember, the only difference between f*cking around and science is writing it down.
If only gordon ramsay could see you now
Want to become legend? Make a circle of people that slap in rythm for hours.
Saw the livestream!   I was here for this!  Slapping to cook is the future!   Also you're fucking amazing lol
Finally after hundreds of years of innovation we can finally do something important with science 🧬
Someone send this to Guga!
this guy be sounding like mark rober
Lol genius video to get viral. Hilarious. Beautiful work. Instant subscribe and thumbs up. Combining engineering skills with ridiculous humor. Top
Other virgin chefs: *cooks chicken  in normal ways* Chad Louis Weisz: *SLAPP*
Hello here before a million views
I greatly appreciate the 'ope'.
*Uses science at its max to cook a steak by slapping*  *Uses plastic fork and knife to cut the steak*
The Mythbusters would be proud. This reminds me of their episode where they tenderized a steak with explosives.
this is like the progression of mark rober into michael reeves
Now this is science
There's an easier way. Make the chicken bounce inside a bucket. Like the machines that mix paint by shaking the can. Better use of energy and better return.
LESGOOOOO
Now this is a fancy restaurant.
This dude literally beat his meat so hard he cooked it
They called me a madman.
I wonder if shaking it would be more efficient?
Nothing like slapping the chicken
all of this started with a redittor
youtube unsubbed me again
Louis Weiss and William Osman should pitch Mythbusters II to discovery
FINALLY!!!
YES YOU FINALLY DID IT
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
I saw [redacted channel] attempt to do this
The mad lad did it! You crazy son of a gun!
How tf this dude surviving in 10c I'd be freezing my wattles off.
Mark Rober music has a new home
YESSSSS
He made the meat more tender with each slap
You guys need to collab with mark rober
Anyone notice the "Mark Rober" signature background music? Nice touch.
Anyone else skeptical, about the stake cause he left and then cane back with a perfect stake
He is Disguised Mark Rober
_BEAT THE MEAT_
I don’t know you, however I really appreciated the effort you put into this. It’s really stupid, and I like dumb shit 🤙
He took the term "beating the meat" too literally.
this called "Ayam Geprek"
No fucking way, this is the best thing I have ever seen, congratulations.
i wanna get slapped by that thing
Wow, didn't think you'd be able to pull this off. Congratulations, good sir. This day will go down in infamy.
HE DID IT LADS AND LASSIES
Noice
Congratulations, you made history
I am in awe...what a historical moment
I remember a channel called ████ █████ and these 2 chads decided to slap a chicken with their bare hands, of course it didn't work but it was still fun to watch it go down                     Memento Mori
You have a warrior's respect
Wow. I knew you could do it.
Amazing
pasteurization? more like beating each individual germ to death haha
this is how REAL men cook
Bro, you should just have had 2 rigs.
You know the video is gonna be go when it has the same background music as mark robers
The tight wrapping also minimizes random spread of raw chicken. Which looks  like it would be a very effective way of aerosolizing salmonella.
The only thing that frustrates me here is that I would be liquid cooling every single inch of this thing. I don’t even care I’ll call the wood. If you’ve poured this much time into it, I don’t get why you only solve one problem at a time. If one part overheats, you can probably expect another one to overheat too, so go out of your way and call them both
Christalmighty.  I don't know what this says about our species.
WHO WANTS SOME SLPPED COOKED CHIKEN?!
Here I am watching this at 2 AM, totally worth it!!
This still doesn’t count
You did it
I'll tell my grandchildren that I witnessed this glorious moment in history
the return of the king
Mark rober music?
*Sous vide slapper cooking*
All this progress just to find out he smacks when he eats. Respect lost.
where can i buy one
Dang look at our boy right there.... he has now achieved his life’s purpose
ayyy adam ragusea
Thats just about the most impressive thing ive ever seen
*remembers that one badger video*
I Know what you should have done  You should have put it in an oven Duh 😂🤣     So it didn’t lose heat
Whats the song starting at 0:58?
I’m so glad there is a new simple way of cooking a chicken 🐔:)
Terror
Nice one comrade, keep it up!
Algorithm is going to love this one
oh my god. i cant believe i was only a few hours late
the music in the beginning reminds me of mark rober, you know youve watched too much yt when you can tell what song someone on yt uses just by 10 seconds of it
Is this just the default engineering music now?
Can't wait until some survival guy uses the slap cooking technique.
This dude is following a mark rober style video closely even down to the music, I dont like this copycat thing
The madman did it
Ewww a commie
Gordon Ramsay Be Like: WHAT THE FU-
This is humanity peak
Wow,, an actual video on beating your meat? 🤦‍♂️Kids don't do that at home...!👈
I'll be a part of history now.
Don’t take this wrong I mean it as a compliment but you are a crackhead mark rober
I think im gonna just gonna put mine on the grill next time
"Meat beater had a problem"
Dono why I wanted to know how many slaps does it take to cook a chicken
That dead chicken must be honored.
make mark rober do this too. as he is also an engineer(?)
Heh... meatbeater
Hire sr pelo to slap that chicken
I’ve been checking your channel for weeks! So excited you’re back! Been following you since wayyyy before the chicken vid! Welcome back and congrats on the subscriber boom!
Finally, humanity has peaked
"and this is what's it all about"
The chicken god doesn't want you to eat unseasoned  chicken
Madlad
Legend
I would simply slap it myself for I am constructed uniquely
Also you’re missing a big scientific step to getting better cooking. Heat rises, so cooking slapping from top to bottom is inefficient. You have to completely redesign your rig to slap from bottom to top
The Mythbusters would love this
Louis seems like a mix of Micheal reeves and mark rober
This is exactly the time, when YouTube algorithm is trying to tell you that you are not allright.

That's one way to tenderize meat...
“I’m roasted”      But that chicken isn’t
super tender steak
if you can get past the fact that it tastes like shit, then it actually is pre good -Louis Weiz 2021
Now you have salmonella if it was a chicken...   Chicken is medium rare if you continued.. but it was a steak xD o7
I was here
Your beating your meat
4:46 why would you kill Sam o’ nella, he’s a great YouTuber
he finally did it...
Never, has a man beaten his meat this hard
He's kinda like Mark Rober
You are welcome you are the best
Real science?  Eh, Kelvins?
if I use the same music as Mark Rober will YouTube make me more famous?
chicken
meat beater 9000 lol
The new mark rober. He even has the same music
Heaven : The actual chicken : God : Hey bro look its you
What the hell am I even doing here?
Let's gooo we're making history boys
He actually did it
Did this guy just create the least efficient meat cooker & tenderizer?
now we need to get tested to notice this project and build a machine that can actually do that without burning out
Im happy and proud about this work, but is that a really slap ? Seems to be more like a punch. And I don't think we cook just to kill microbes, no one can literally eat a chicken without cooking, I think it's about the taste and texture.  I hope your best, thanks
The first video you made on this is how I found your channel and I’m so grateful that you asked this question
Ghost of the chicken looking at its corpse: why are humans so damn weird
Saw a technoblade thumbnail in this video
You sir, your ancestors smile down upon you.
Who would slap the meat better?  Davie504 or MS9001?
No getting up to 40 first and then cooking it halfway is not cooking, thats cheating. Its still myth busted. To get confirmed you have to fully cook it by slapping only.  This is the equivalent of getting dropped off by helicopter 300ft from the top of Mt Everest and then claiming you climbed it when in reality you cheated. For a real climb, be a man and start from the bottom
9:32 is what you came for
WHERES THE FUCKIN CHICKEN
Now, this is science
Finnaly
If you don't cook everything with this contraption I'm gonna be flat out disappointed.
Awww man he playin da Mark Rober Music
just how grandma used to make it
Can you cook a chicken by slapping it?  Yes. But don't.
1 question            why
Mark Rober 2.0
he slapped the crap outta the germs in the steak
He got that Mark Rober music so you know he is very very doing that science work and got the big brain
Wow he did it!
A chicken died for this...
No one: Guys when there home alone: 6:39
*cue me, a american being confused on how hot Celsius is*
Who knew keeping a chicken mildly warm for 2 hours would make it smell like shit?
He could have just cooked a steak to 54*c and it would be easier
He just needed a small chicken
Do you think you could sufficiently upgrade this technique to accommodate cooking a turkey in time for this year's Slapsgiving Day?
Ultra tenderized
ah yes, the meat beater
Haha in my mind you still had like 5k subs. Didn’t realize how much you blew up. Glad to see you’re getting the recognition you deserve. This was quite the journey lol
That is awesome.😎
*FERB I KNOW WHAT WERE GONNA DO TODAY*
I heard this as a meme, but seeing it make a reality, makes me happy
Its happening, everybody stay calm
Lol using the same music as mark rober
Hey in celebration can you put the Meat Slapper shirt back on the market now that I can actually afford it?
So where can i order a slapcook steak?
Next video: Im in the hospital for salmonella
Redemption arc pog
VEGETA, WHAT DOES THE SCOUTER SAY ABOUT HIS MEATBEATING LEVEL?
He might have not succesfully cooked a chicken with slaps but it shows possible for the other meats bravo
IM WATCHING SCIENCE MOM
Give it another try, but make an efficient slapping arm that is reinforced so it don’t break, than put the chicken in a air suction bag, than into a holder that won’t let it move, than let it run day in and day out
imagine being a chicken, dying, going to a store, to only be cooked by being slapped thousands of times.
You did it! You crazy SOB, you did it.
so no chicken then..
he actually did it
5:47 chat😰

This is important, this means something!
'You did it. You crazy son of a b!tch you actually did it!"
I’m watching this in the middle of the night How a guy is cooking meat with a slapper
Yea but how many punches would it take to cook a chicken
9:21 jd
This seems like enough to make me subscribe
Nobody: All the chickens watching this: hand go brr
9:40
You never gave up
boys in puberty be like
A new way to slap,... the meat around...
İ really gotta go sleep now its literally 2:37 am
beat the meat
time to get a Waigu steak lmao or do a compalation with Goya
God this is why we don't return to monke 😳
How do I rig this up to my car so dinners ready when I get home?
Congrats! But you really should of just called Davie504 for this one
Cookware of the future !!
Inspiring.
The bible says all things are possible  🤣😇🤣
lol
Literally No One This dude:  Cooking with slapping
Perfect reference to "beat my meat"
Thw mad man actually did it
Our body is at 37-38 degree should not you starting e the slapper at this hest to make it work correctly?
"can I get a steak, slapped medium rare? I don't like the grilled taste"
Beat meat eat repeat
I somehow had salmonella like 2 times because my mom doesn’t know what cooked is It’s always really pink on the inside because I always take a big bite inside then I realize it’s undercooked
Should have used a smaller wheel with another lever arm for faster slapping
can you patent this and open ur own restaurant or sell it to big chain?
Now you gotta try to boil water haha
Who spotted the Jebać Disa on 11:54
that chicken was definatley not cooked. it was still pink
- Babe, what's with all that noise you were making in the kitchen?  *- I was beating my meat*  - WTF? I demand an apology. How dare you beat your meat in our kitchen!!  *- You're gonna change your mind once its in your mouth*  - Why would I put your nasty man-meat in my mouth?  *- Coz it's hot*
The new Mark Rober, even playing the song!
You could say you beat your meat until it overheat
2:08 So basically what's happening with us now. Global warming is not because of humans, but Aliens who want to cook us before coming and devour us. *It all make sense now*

Congratulations sir, you shall go down in history on the same level as Pythagoras.  This is a truly epic achievement in Human History.
That one kid who took the joke too far. That was a fun ride ngl even youtube recommended me. Take my subs!
This is like nasa making a pen that works in space lol
Davie504 is shaking
He did it, the absolute mad man did it
He did it. The madlad has finally done it.
Have you ever seen these industrial paint shakers that go up and down really fast? Maybe you could build something like this.  Then put two horizontal plates in it, some walls to the sides with a door somewhere, so you get a closed box. You put the steak in that box, and because the whole thing slams up and down really fast you get double the amount of impacts, it would get cooked more quickly. You could still pack it in aerogel, but you might need a remote thermometer. Maybe worth a trie? And exactly how tender was it? Could be a good method to turn bad cuts into tender steaks 🤔😂
Next video: I cooked a human by slapping it
Why didn't you season it?
That's definitely repeated blunt force trauma and not a "slap"
Here it is!
This actually worked? You need a Guinness world record. How many slappers did you make?
This has got to be the most ridiculous scientific experiment I have ever seen.  But... I liked it.
No one talking about the peter sripol background
you shouldve attached heaters to the slapper that wouldve cooked
Kyle Hill: No, you can't cook a chicken by slapping it!  You: Hold my beer.
Imagine being the animal and seeing a part of you being cooked by slapping
Oh         He did it     Nice
YEEEES HE DID IT
HE ACTUALLY DID IT, LETS GOOOOOO
"Beat the life out of it" It's uh, it was dead when it got there.
That's one hell of a way to beat your meat.
What was the original estimate?
Yes
Now patent it
He had done the impossible
He has done it. The quest is finally finished.
Damn that chicken slaps
Is it balanced properly? Cause if one side of the arm is to heavy it might be bad for the motor
Screw you nasa this is real science
What other meat can the MB9001 beat?
The madlad did it.
OMG THANKS TO USE METRIC SYSTEM
I just know percussive stoves will be the new fad in the next decade.
this is a comment to help with the algorithm
mans took beating meat to a whole new level
this is the highlight of my day
No way
They said it couldn't be done, they were wrong   -Jaggger

My life has meaning again thankyou
The beginning feels like you’re watching mark rober.
I THOUGHT IT WAS IMPOSIBLE??!!??
"I wanted nothing more than to eat a meal cooked by the power of slaps", sponsored by Davie504
We did it BOIS!
You should try Kelvin.
THE SLAP
But would you do it again?
if you are going to do it again, you can try using two bags and put some felt fabric between the bags as insulation and also to generate more friction every slap
the meat beater
i need gordon ramsay to react to it
THE MADLAD HE ACTUALLY DID IT
So much Engineering went into this and i think it's a great time to be alive
all that and no seasoning
This man is the GOD of beating meat
SLAP VIDE CHICKEN
1:55 boys after a long day of school
this is the small mark rober
0:57 This makes me feel like I’m watching Mark Rober
Mans subtle flexing the Mars yards while he cooked a whole ass chicken with slaps.absolute legend.
I would like to buy this so I can eat a steak made with the power of slap
M8 send this to Gordon Ramsay to get a response
You could have heated the slapper to 98 degrees F because a hand is that temperature. Technically, it’s allowed because a hand slaps.
Finaly the fabled legend of the reddit threads. It has been fulfilled
The mad man did it
HE DID YOU DID IT YOU MAGIC MAN YOU DID IT
I said "Aight time to do some work and stop watching youtube." But then I saw this video and I knew what I had to do.
The second he referred to it as a "meat beater" I imagined some idiot attaching a fleshlight to it.  What has the internet done to my mind?
Yeaaaaa this can be a thesis
slapping your food to cook it is now an official cooking method
9:21 który to kurwa taki mądry? XDDDD
I cant believe he actually did it
I was there for the steak eating. As in i was watching the stream live
Hmm. Where i know this music from. Hmmmmmmmmmm
The mark rober music
Glad you solved this problem.
He has defied the will of the gods. He has achieved the impossible.
What was the cost of your final setup?
Dude,just buy a rotisserie chicken
Did you know you can eat raw chicken if you blanch it then trim it since the bacteria lives on the outside it makes it safe to eat
The pre-chewer 9000
This dude using celcius like a pleb, smh. Real scientists use Kelvin or rankine
9:18 is what you came for
Did you get Guinness world record yet?
He uses the same voice and music as Mark robber lol
chiggen
it used way more energy because it was so dang loud. surrounded by a box of insulating material, more of the sound would be converted to heat, and need less slaps. also a box would hold in the heat that was radiating into the room. thats why we cook chickens in the oven and not on the stovetop usually.
The scale used for "real science" is Kelvin, not Celsius, but ok....
Everyone was asking if we could, but no one stopped to think if rather we should
that steak looked vile
Humanity's biggest question has been answered and proved
This is my auto clicker
pog
oh my god.
Let's get it my boi! So proud! Top stuff. 👌
I got recommended this, nice.  Hehe, meat beater, great video dude.
"Cautiously optimistic." I see we have a Kenobi fan.
Could you attach a fleshlight to that?
I remember being their when you ate the steak!
Imagine being a chicken getting killed to serve as food but instead your dead body just gets slapped by a random lad
Imagine being a happy chicken and ending up like this
Extra tender
I see you are a man of culture, I cannot ignore the adam ragusea footage 😉
This is a legendary science achievement!
Me wondering why my meat feels hotter than normal
you need more subscribers
Mom hears a slapping noise coming from her son's room.... MOM: Billy! What are you doing in there? BILLY: Cooking a chicken. MOM:....Somehow I knew "Chicken" was going to be in the answer...
I really like the mark rober type music
Louis: Tries to cook a chicken with slaps  Hello Fresh: Yes
I guess you can say you are      Beating the meat?
ltt fans wya
does he finish cooking the rest of it or just waste it all?
I can use the Slaper to slap my enemies! I love you!😍🙃🙃🙃🙃
The shoeeessss!!! Oh myyy
Lets gooo
no fucking way
He did it He finally did it
i'm so proud 🥲
It means if your hungry, you can spank your girlfriend and then eat a butt for diner
Average Fahrenheit fan Average Celsius enjoyer Average Kelvin Enthusiast
This madlad actually did it
"I'll use Celsius, as this ist how real science is done" Kelvin: "Am I a joke to you?"
The Mark Rober music had me dying
it breaks like a drill in payday 2
I am greatfull the youtube algorithm has chosen me to be here
The new sous vide
S L A P
I can now rest in peace
Pog
You know this shit is legendary when it gets to you recommended and it's been only 4hrs      I don't even know this guy but now I know his achivement.
Still love the name. "Meat beater"
I love YouTube
I WAS HERE
THE MADLAD FINALLY DID IT.
It’s finally done. Reality is whatever Louis wants 😂
The music
Anyone looked at his spiral shirt and the title and thinking, unus annus?
Lmao you sound like shaggy from scooby doo when youre excited. Great video
*eats cooked steak* "man! That slaps!"
Ya gotta eat it!
Finally, an answer.
900th coment
Recommendations guided me to this man. And I am happy with it
I REQUIRE that chicken to be eaten
The madman actually did it
The meat beater 3000
Holy Shot the madlad did it
“With the power of slaps, I turned a steak into gum.”
This dude just contribute something to science
What kind of savage eats steak with a plastic knife? Also, congratulations!
Annoyingly fake mark robber
Something about "Slapping chicken" sounds like a euphemism to me
when he says cooked the music is perfectly synced check it out 5:12
Taking "beat my meat" to a new level.
Congratulations you absolute legend
This guy took "beating the meat" to a whole new level. Subscribed.
By go he did it
Who tf disliked this
4:51 my guy just said samonella
Reddit: Everyone: Me: This guy: "I mean alright let's eat it"
Congratulatios for the hard-working!
Cooking a chicken by slapping it>>>literally any international achievement in the past 100 years
Minecraft: yo write this down
This is real science all right
An american surrended by the celsius scale: we definetly don't see it everyday
HowToBasic: Now this looks like a job for me
whats wrong with this guy
The prophecy has been fulfilled.
How did you get those mars yard
"I'm just saying, if you can convert physical energy into thermal energy, how hard do you have to punch a chicken to cook it."
FINALLY! IT HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED!
Today, history was made.
POV: God has left
why on earth did you use plastic silverware?!
that one dude in the comments:beat the meat
Beats meat with it
He did it! He freaking did it!
Watching this eating cooked chicken
You should try something easier like water to see if it's possible to get it to boiling point.
You remind me of Mr. Beast.
Reminds me of Mark Rober
I love youtube
I was here
Ah yes, Celsius. Finally some real science 😌
Sadly most quality content channels post so rarely
We can make shroomitenow
FINALLY THE DAY WE’VE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR
I’m eating chicken while watching this
Technically real sience uses Kelvin degrees
I was there when the steak was cooked holy shit that was an experience
Heavenly would be proud.
vegans be like: 👁👄👁
Favorite cooking channel here.
YES! IT HAPPENED!
You finally did it you sob.
upgrade idea, get electromagnetic solenoids from something, mount them facing downwards onto the chicken thats just on a pottery rotator.
E
HELL YEAH
I will do this to my food wen its cold with my hand
shoulda just slapped it once, *really hard*
My man has a Subscribe to Pewdiepie at the back, mad respect for this guy.   5:39
It's beautiful :D
I love it when engineers use there power for dumb shit like this
Poor chicken xD
I can now die peacefully
Man I've seen all your previous attempts but I'm freaking glad you kept going with this! I cant even begin to imagine the effort and brutality this had on you and through it all you never let the chicken win! Made me glad to see this again I'm definetly staying tuned and sharing this.
The king is back
F for the pivot
i found this vid from a meme i found on instagram lol
„So, what are you doing this evening?“  „Oh, I'm just watching somebody making history, by beating his meat“
„So, what are you doing this evening?“  „Oh, I'm just watching somebody making history, by beating his meat“
I just watched the vid a few days ago. Cant believe it worked afterall.
*s l a p*
You did it! You son of a B! You did it!
Yooooooo What a legend
Hay man I think your taking the term "beat my meat" a little too literal
It can also be used with kids
I now understand the level humanity is at.
get this celsius BS outta here
Yeet The Chicken Out The Window. That Will Cook It Better.
Myth: *BUSTED*
This is a moment of celebration. You should get yourself checked out by the doctor afterwards. Safety first.
This music is what plays in my brain when I solve a hard physics problem
The meat beater 9000... That is hilarious!
He rlly jus tignored the fact that the hydraulic press channel commented a idea
HE FINALLY DID IT
Didn’t even cook the chicken smh damn cb
He did it on,g he did it he cooked that clucker askl,dsnksaldsamlfdanasnsavonsiffpsam
fuckin madlad
3:33
You got to beat the meat  then eat the meat
Did you just cut and eat a steak with a *PLASTIC FORK AND KNIFE????!!!*
[DELETED CHANNEL] could never
✨ *P U L P I F I C A T I O N* ✨
YESSSSS!!!!!!
New challenge: try to burn a chicken.
LET'S FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOO
I'm glad that you made it. Greetings from Brazil.
Been watching the streams for a while, the fruits of your labor paid off
This is the type of guy that likes their chicken sushi style
3:27 onlyfans
I have a paragraph due tomr but here I am
They said it couldn’t be done, I say choke on your words fool
w9wowow
Imagine being a chicken and then having your dead body used to test an industrial strength slapping machine
tenderizes and cooks at the same time
Nobody slapped so hard since davie504
Well the Mongols used to put meat between their butts and saddles to tenderise it this way soooo if you stretch your imagination this is not the first time meat was cooked by slapping
If you used the toughest steak you could buy, it's no wonder it was so chewy.
Epic truly epic
I wonder why the texture of the steak isn't all that great. It couldn't possibly be because you beat the living hell out of the thing. That's not the reason at all.
Cool now start an onlyfans so you can stream yourself choking your chicken til it’s fully cooked
We have greaness
Wow wasn't expecting him to continue. That's some true engineering.
*jolyne joestar at the beginning:*
they said it could never be done
FINALLY LETS GOOO
Sub just for the i need a joint coment lmao
Moment of truth 10:22
now cook 3.14 of them
Finally hard work and consistency paid back
tenderizing a steak while cooking it, should be great but I guess you can over tenderize
History books will remember this moment
really cool!
congrats mate ur life changing
NO FUCKING WAY
degrees F is better, and its used in industry
Yesssss
0:57 Mini Mark Rober lol
The F*cking legend did it!!
LMFAO. I was just thinking about the previous video last week
1:00  Mark Robber vibe
Why didn't you season it?
this guy is like a knock off mark robar
This is what I meant when I said “ima go beat my meat”
This is what quarentine does to us,    *It makes us solve the real problems in the world and by real problems I mean good shower thoughts*
You fucking mad lad you done it
Stop beating your meat in my workshop
The hero the world needs right now
guess what?                       This is super hilarious!
You did cook the chicken with SLAPS but I wanna see someone to slap and cook it, like in one slap
I love Hello fresh, I call it hell o fresh it’s so good
send this to davie504
If you have children to feed with these ideas.... They gonna starve to death before they got the meal lol
Imagine chilling as a bacteria and suddenly you die of *S L A P P*
When does the restaurant open?
The Music is just legendary
@gordanramsay please
Dude now you just need to sell "slap cooked chicken" to really rich people who have nothing better to spend their money on as a luxury item. Seriously. They could brag to all their friends that they are one of the only people in the world to ever eat slap cooked chicken.  Slap together a good looking website (no pun intended) that looks fancy and such and profit! lol
Petition for collab with Mark Rober
Ok...
my favorite CBT video
Are your wearing the new Nike mars yard? 🔥  BTW I enjoy your videos
Wow
1:00
You see the real reason this didn't really work out in the end was because you measured everything in C° but everyone knows that real REAL science is measured in Kelvin
are not gonna talk about how he used mark rober's background music?    no, okay
It’s, it’s beautiful.
MADLAD FKING DID IT
What a time to be alive
I cried such a beautiful storyline
1:04 “the original meat beater”
I thought this was a prank video. Like another fail. But the happiness i get for seeing the result. Is overwhelming bruh
This is cash money
Imagine he hangs onto that thing and he finds out his son got some girl pregnant...
Lmaooooo the meat beater
Can i ate it?
This mad lad went to college. Money well spent for sure.
Wish I knew about this when you were taking ideas because you could've slapped the chicken twice as many times with the same motor/slapper speed by attaching another arm to the opposite end of the rotor, getting two slaps per cycle. You could've actually decreased the speed of the motor a whole lot  while keeping the slaps per minute equal to your design and getting a much longer sustained on time from your rig with less strain on all moving parts. Heck, you could've used more than two slapping arms, 3,4,5... 8 arms all taking turns slapping the chicken!
Davie504 is impressed
Wait... 42069 comes before 69420 Hmmmm....
He did it
make mashed potatos
*MEAT BEATER 9001* should be tested on steak as well
Man I thought you died from consuming too much ethanol
The madlad did it... he actually did it
I am more than happy for you man for persuading your dream of slapping the shit out of all the chickens in the world, but seriously what is wrong with you?
MeatBeater
gg! i cant belive something like this is finally complete!
Young Mark Rober
I remember participating in 69420 part
The mad man he actually did it
wildlife survival tip: if u want u have cooked food when u are stuck in a jungle                 you spank a chicken XD
dude what a legend
So, I mean have you heard of power hammers? They hit hard but they can't buckle. Some of them use leaf springs to transfer force from the flywheel to the hammer, some use two pistons to compress and push air into the hammer. One piston for compression the other to receive the force.  Your hammer was so forceful by comparison.
This reminds me of a video, but one that isn’t alive anymore
I'm watching this at 2am ._.
SOMEONE TAG GUGA!!!
Me: oh no, the stove broke! How am I gonna cook the dinner now?  Hungry me:
You madlad, you finnaly did it! Awesome video!
Finally, quality content, we're seeing breakthroughs in engineering here
My mom would burn it
Well done, man. You have proved your worth to humanity. Your spirit will join those of the ancients in the halls of valhalla and you will have slapped beer and virgins etcetera etcetera etcetera... 😆😆
actually the point of cooking is to extract more nutrients from the food we eat and make it easier to digest. thats the whole reason why we started cooking food in the first place. getting rid of dangerous pathogens in the meat is just a side product
Beats his meat untill it is cooked. "Feels kinda soft."  You have probably beaten it way too much, but I am no meat-beating expert. ;)
As a man who believes in science, I am just gonna say I loved MB9001 for this results
So how long until I can replace my kitchen sous vide machine with a "slap vide"?
In the first video i said if he can cook it than i will subscribe. And now for this video i said if he is gonna eat the chicken than I'll subscribe. It didn t go well as I wanted but i appreciated your hard work so liked the video.
"The original meat beater"
“Ovens were made in 1490.” People in 1489:
This is a man of focus, commitment and sheer fuc*ing will!
ok
Cool
how long would it take to cook a chicken if you rubed it with felt so the ebrasion caused friction to make heat
I was almost afraid I'd never see the day.
Chikne slpap!!!!!!
Here in the first 2h pog
whoever commented chicken sized plate armor is a genius
Pure determination
We did it guys. We really did it.
ok now how about "do crabs wonder fishes are flying"?
Amazing advancement in science
good job I’ve watched almost al the streams
Yay
I subscribed as I witnessed the turning point of history.
Finally we have finally finished beating the meat
I'm. So happy For this
he finally did it LETS GOOO
At last! Tonight I can sleep better knowing the answer to life's final great mystery
Effin congrats man 😆
🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The madman did it
finally the saga is complete
Okay this is creepy... youtube recommended this to me 2 minutes after watching the episode “Slapsgiving” from How I Met Your Mother
-Celsius is used for real science Kelvin:  am I a joke to you?
whats next ? Fish, meat ?
Way to get sponsored dude!!! This was a great project and video! Keep it up :D
Is that Peter's shop?
That rare steak must have made you delirious. That chicken is as pink as Belle Delphine's wig.
The ppl how downvoted are vegans
Not the hero was deserved, but the hero we needed
Somehow my brain tells me to tell you to add a voice saying *"Hit me harder daddy"* every 15 seconds
Those Tom Sachs tho👀👀👀 were you part of Nike’s wear test program?
He did it...The madlad really did it
Just delete fahrenheit altogether
1:05  ThE oRiGiNaL MeAt BeAtEr
I am glad I was watching some of these streams
the madlad did it!
The future really *IS* now
Jezuz u did it
*_Mark rober music intensifies_*
He's actually beating his meat
Why can't I visit his Instagram profile, is it deleted?
i love how when the steak hit 60 C there was some pole that decided to write jebac disa in the chat, moments like this make very proud of being polish.
Sure perseverance was cool but this guy literally cooked a chicken by beating the hell out of it
Tenderized
Noice
I was in this video. If you look in chat you can see me.
S c I e N c E
He is the new Mark Rober, he acts like him and he plays the same music as him.
Time to beat the meat      Clapping noises intensify
I have been waiting for this video since the first one came out and by God you've done it. Mission success. You really used your time in lockdown wisely.
Those livestreams were pretty fun. Lots of good slapp jokes. Glad you slapped your heart out kid. Elon Musk watch out
WHERE IS THE LAMB SAUSSSEEEEEEE
YESSS
I don't really know if any chicken gets actually cooked properly at 60c
Officially a cooking channel now.
Oh my god congrats! 3 watched streams later!!
SO MANY SLAPS😳😱, it's awesome that you were actually able to do this though
This guy should do an experiment with Mark Rober
Everybody gangsta till he gets diarrhea
Markiplier
Finally, he did it.
I'll tell my children about the time I took part in cooking a chicken using kinetic energy.
im down in history
I love this manz
He is a successful person and also gives me Mark Rober vibes keep up the good work dude was here since 70K
Y E S
Stole the mark rober music, not even mad abt it
Reddit, We have done it.
9:21 pozdrawiam polaczków na czacie xDD
I to jebać disa na czacie XDDD
Mark rober music never gets old
Ten spam JEBAĆ DISA JEBAĆ DISA JEBAĆ DISA JEBAĆ DISA na czacie XD
So everytime my hand gets slapped its hours away from being cooked. AmAzInG
Meanwhile: At the engineer's department of Black Mesa.  "Oh, the oven is broken, and the microwave, And the Rice cooker. Everything is broken.."   Louis: "Why don't we slap it?"  "What?"
Dr. Doofenshmirtz is getting desperate.
Congrats! Been great watching your dream, struggle and achieve this accomplishment
He actually did it!
Wow
"chicken" STEAk
No way.
U earned it man.. You are THE ULTIMATE MEAT SLAPPPER
*notices guns saves lives sticker* bruh.. you just got your bell rung. smart man.
About  d a m n time!! Now letsgo to the moon using ballons
You keep my faith in humanity alive
Wow
Finally. I know it’s possible, I have a new goal in life
There's no greater science that slapping a chicken
easier ways to cook a chicken...
😍
Slap
1:56 😳
Yay
You got the MARS YARDS???
"And how would you like your chicken, Sir?"  "Slapped."
"And how would you like your chicken, Sir?"  "Slapped."
"And how would you like your chicken, Sir?"  "Slapped."
Dude, this effort on slap-cooking a chicken is amazing.
He did it
I feel like this guy is going to be the next Mark Rober.

WAIT THIS IS A VERY FAMILIAR SONG
I fucking love YouTube
Can you imagine spending money on project that.... You can just buy stove or Oven??? Dude... That's crazy reallyy 👏👏 You need to be entered to Guinness world record for the first person to cook meat by slapping lol
I am so glad this worked out!
A success after so many failures, GREAT!
I wonder who came up with this idea, it must’ve been someone and I wonder if they know that their idea has gotten to this!
Everything about how this project evolved was legendary. Who would have guessed the amount of engineering behind such a *glorious* cooking method?
I'm glad this was solved. I mean, we could be working on cancer cures and stuff but this was the real priority.
I’m very proud to have been here since the beginning
You stole Mark Robers music
Finally we did it guys
Oof it took him 2 months to do it
Noice
Hello, I'm a LTT fan
How american using plastic cutlery 😂😂 But congratulations!!
It was a great journey
Yes, a Scientific discovery on Einstein's birthday.
This video slaps
Tenderizing the meat while you are cooking it, new age tech
Dislikes are angry vegans
I mean Kelvin is the scientific temperature measurement, but doesn't make sense in this situation really. And Celsius and Kelvin are easily convertablr
6:07 bigstackd casting has entered the chat
He did it boys, after all this time.
finally
9:22 Jebać Disa
Now do it with a live chicken
Thats a hot chick you got there man
i luv ur editing
11:55 Jebać Disa
Let's be honest, this is what all we needed 4life
He did it goddamn it
I'm glad you tried this again
this comment is historical proof that I was here to witness this.
Nice
Imagine being this guy's neighbour
auto clicker be like
I realised how much failure an engineers or a scientist face just to prove some theory.....hats off to you sir and all the hard working geniuses from science background......thank you for never giving up!!
We need to spam this to Gordon Ramsay lol
why am i watching this
When your oven stops working on a roast sunday:
FINALLY
I've seen this cooked strength only once before  *They didn't slap it enough then*
Cool
You should throw some tomatoes in there for flavour and stuff #noulteriormotive
9:21 JEBAĆ DISA KURWE ZWISA
You should turn down the threads on the  crank pin, It'll last a heck of a lot longer and where in as opposed to where out also adding a oil pot on the yoke (personally I wouldent use a yoke instead using a eccentric connected to a 90* bell crank to give a more controlled motion) to give continuous lubrication.  We use this same arrangement on model steam engines that have a vertical valve spindle like on a Stuart Beam Engine.
YOU FINALLY DID IT, CONGRATULATIONS
Eating chicken is always an occasion!
Giving CPR to the Chicken until it wokes up...
Appause to you and that crack team of Discord engineers
That chicken's mum must be so proud
Best physics channel I’ve ever subscribed to
My time has come...
nice
That cow still has a pulse
Now i can die in peace
He finaly solved worldwide problem.
Madlad
F
I literally just watched the first part of this the other day, it’s like YouTube knows when the future is happening
This guy out here making slap machines while i am making a small raft
Oh u actually did it
THE MAD LAD FUCKING DID IT
I have been a huge fan of your channel man I dropped in for the streams (luckily 2 am in America is midday in India) congrats on the chicken keep it up :)
It's funny seeing him hesitant to switch over to celsius, but by time goes on he will learn celsius is actually the correct way of measuring temperature!
that could be a new torture method  *t h e   s l a p    m a c h i n e*
One small cook for chicken, one big slap for mankind
Love it when Dansez starts playing, Mark Rober vibe
WHAT THE-
FINALLLYYYYY
Someone says the N word in the chat at 5:46, but you gotta watch it at 0.25 speed to catch it
If its worth doing       Its worth overdoing 👍 .
LETS FUCKING GOOOOO
Best part 2 of any vid on YouTube
OH YESSSSS
Now someone post this to Kyle Hill’s channel
P:Hey you got smthing to eat? A:Yeah gotchu P:Thats raw chicken... A:*Slaps it* hell yeah P:oh shit
This video really slaps
Couldn't believe it when I saw the title. Yay!
It felt a bit like cheating when you "pre-cooked" it, but damn, you are the definition of a Mad Lad.
WE DID IT BOI THE CHICKEN IS COOKED
This is the future Mark Rober
This madlad has finally did the impossible
A moment of silence for all the chickens that died to make this glorious feat of engineering that is a video possible
pog
He did it !!
Is this live
Bro can’t wait for 1mil subs, ur insanely underrated rn.
I'm just glad to be a part of something that really matters
Good job mate
Waiter: How would you like your chicken? Me: Slapped.
The secret to soft steak; slap the shit out of it.
Celsius
Very cool, I was afraid that I had wasted my time on the first video, finally chicken is slapped to a chef’s kiss of perfection
You achieved a Perfect Cooking on this chicken and made a special dish: Slapped Madame.      Yes, this is a Genshin Impact reference, please don't kill me.
Please show this to Gordon Ramsey
slap chicken         i need chicken slap
Would it have worked if you slap something and that something transfers the heat to cook the food in a chamber to avoid it getting pulverized
7:05 You already know what im going to say...       December 1st in a nutshell...
9:21 jebać disa
Actually all science uses kalbin
After multiple attempts he finally confirmed a reddit post. ABSOLUTE MADLAD
Gordan Ramsey: It's Raw!
This makes quarantine worth it.
Yessss!!!!!! So i can eat it nowww❤️
The snapper slaps the steak as hard as my dad would.
also louis a week later : guys i got salmonela :(
Can you boil water by stirring it?
This is chicken cooking history
YOOOOOO. YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO DEADASS??
oh my god the comeback, thanks for not giving up!
This is history.
this started as a testing of an internet joke and turned into pushing the boundaries to slap meat into perfection
You dare to call hpc:s idea bad.   As a finnish person that hurt but well...  i am just kidding.
Alright, next ya gotta test of you can make a rc tank with a bb gun in it, and have it fight others like big gun rc ship combat.
omg this is a very important day fort humanity
Such an absolute beast.  I love this video.  Do you have a patreon?????
hahaha nice
The return of the King
I just rewatched the OG slap video 2 days ago. This is excellent
Everybody knows that bacteria is killed by slaps... hence the lower cook temperature.
My man's truly doing the God's work
He has done it!
I love this "jebać disa" in the chat, it has totally nothing to do with slapping a chicken
Bro you can't just put Mark Rober music on your video it makes your science too powerful
I cant believe it actually a success
The madman
The future is here
9:21 nice chat (polish people will understand)
You inspire me to never give up
YES ITS HERE!
This is a true scientific achievement
Meat experienced kinetic energy
AMIGO LO LOGRASTE
My boyfriend is officially a professional meat beater...
Cooks the steak using a extremely expensive and work intensive meat slapper  Also eats steak with plastic fork and knife
ok
Remember folks: it's not stupid if it works
It's pretty funny that you basically sous vide a chicken with slaps.
They actually did it
Bout time
Now make bike for cooking chicken, if you ride you produce energy that power slaping arm
E
i loved the chicken slap livestreams. never have i been so excited to watch a number slowly count up
Dude I subbed to you a few months ago when you only had a few thousand subs and I hoped your channel would grow much larger. Really stoked to see a massive bump in subs and views, well deserved.  Keep slappin' that chicken
i just got done watching the other one holy shit im so proud
Man he’s upped his game - using the mark rober music now - he’s destined for success
Pure science
Good job man!! I cant wait to hear whats next!
This video totally gives Mark Rober vibes. And heck yes you have achieved it!
But why didn't you season it before slappification?
Poggers
WEEEE DID ITTTTT
Omg finally! He has so much determination lol
Congratulations!!! Tell Gordon your parents are very proud!
FINALLY
pog chicken
mission accomplished
F
I was here!!! (I was also at 8:51 watching the stream when it was for discord only lol. JOIN THE DISCORD!!!) This is sooo cool!
Damn good job
E
While i was watching this video a weird family situation happened:  *My mom enters * "What are you doing?" *Me * "Just watching a chicken get cooked whit slaps" "Why i waste my time talking to you" *Dad enters* "What are you doing?" "Watching a chicken get cooked with slaps" "NO WAY! LET ME SEE" *My sister enter* "*WHAT'S APP FAMIL...*" Dad "SHUT UP THE CHICKEN'S ALMOST COOKED!"
Operation:  *_BEAT DA MEAT_*
I would love to see if you could actually eat a slap-cooked chicken, as well as wondering how it tastes!
The real chicken was the friends we made long the way.
finally, some good fucking food.
Chicken be like - Man just Get over this Cooking with Slap method Fast, it's been Months I'm Getting Slapped Again and Again and Again 😂
At long last. Now the next question. Can you make a perfect medium rare steak by rubbing it?
This is gonna be the next eco friendly way of cooking
I get so tired of that argument just because the rest of the world can’t understand Fahrenheit
Didn't see any live stream, so this is exciting to see :D
This got popular really quick
This is so researched content deserves so much views
Celsius ❤
Just realized this dude looks like the mix between Billiam and William Osman lmao
We've done it boys, chicken bacteria is no more.
Oh, so this channel is the definition of Mad Lad 😎🤙
This is amazing but I'm kinda sad that the steak turned out bad
HE DID IT! THE MADMAN ACTUALLY DID IT!!!!
FINALLY!
Wait is this in peter stripols shop?
11:55 u should look on chat
As an Asian and Uncle Roger fan, I impress that you have a rice cooker😙😙
I’m sad now... this was the main reason I followed and it’s done. So what’s next?
This is the level of commitment I would like to put into the most important things in my life. And that is definitely not slap cooking a chicken 😂 😂🐔
Louis finally getting the views he deserves with these quality videos
Dude he just snagged Mark Robbers music
*_CAN WE JUST MAKE A COOK BOOK BUT ITS ALL JUST USING SLAPPING MACHINES TO COOK THE FOOD?_*

hmmmm.... original meat beater, what could that mean?
History has been written. A meme came to life. And I am honoured to have experienced that.
I've been following that slapping journey since the beginning and I must say the video you uploaded is really underwhelming.
The prequel to this was my last video of 2020
The actual madman, he did it
But why
We are all witnessing history
We all saw this in your live streams
Pog
The Madlad did it, congratulations 🔥🔥
You had so many live streams for this? Kinda disappointing you didnt eat it. Come on maaaaan
