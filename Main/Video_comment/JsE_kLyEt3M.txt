He’s absolutely incredible
Golden Boy 2020, Big year of Youth footballer's. My three in order - 3rd Alphonso Davies Position: Left-Back 🇨🇦 2nd Jadon Sancho Position: Right Winger 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 "Winner" 1st Erling Braut Haaland Position: Centre-Forward 🇧🇻 ⚡
I love bd
What a fantastic player. Would be great to see him in the premier league instead of the mickey mouse leagues of mainland Europe where there are only ever one or occasionally two teams contending for league. As good as he is, Bayern Munich will yet again be champions come 2021
I know training must be hell for the BVB keepers, if this is how he's finishing in matches LOOOOL
Where was it he said he wanted to win the Champions League at............?  Marcelo is waiting.
Leeds born and bred. He still needs to improve, but I'm sure he'll achieve his dream of playing for Leeds United one day!
This guy is a menace
This lad is going to cost a LOT of money when he moves on.......
The Bundesliga is like the SPL...
To think he could’ve gone to Man Utd but we managed to mess up the transfer, just as well probably, we would’ve probably wasted him
classic haaland
Why is the commentator calling him Horlins?
What’s happened with sancho? Are they playing a new system that doesn’t suit his style or has he just been off the pace so far this season
Does anyone know of haaland is eligible to play for England as he was born in Leeds?
Hurry up and sign for Liverpool
In real life he plays like he does for me in FIFA 21🤣
He looks like such a dork it's funny....
Some shyte defenders in that league, he's wasted there needs to play in the prem.
Top 2 striker in the world
No doubt will end up in the premier league where we will take all your best talent 😂
Every club should be trying to sign him
Crikey the commentator is a bit urgent ain't he?
He'll be a good player one dsy
What were Manchester United board thinking in 2018/19 transfer link.🤔😂
2nd inform haaland
He has literally every attribute going.
Come to Leeds haaland cheers
But could he do it on a rainy night at Stoke
I think the only reason this guy isn't marketed everywhere and considered the true next big thing is because of how he looks.  He's an odd looking chap, and his interviews are as brilliant as they are awkward.  If he was a Brazilian with Mbappe's face then he's be pretty much the number 1 talent when people look beyond the Messi/ Ronaldo duopoly.
Come to man united thanks.
There’s no stopping this lad is there? He’s an absolute beast 💪💪🤙😱
We need him at mancity!!!!!
My god United missed out
Reminds of when zlatan was younger but with mad winger pace. Lethal finisher this guy is any angle he bangs. Already playing at top of the elite level. Best striker in the world
FFS Woodward, just go and buy him!  Whatever it takes
Remember incompetent United had a chance to sign him!
Hes going to score 50+ goals in the future in 1 season, possibly multiple times
I'm just sad that Boyata left Celtic hahahaha he is woeful
I think once haaland leaves reyna will shine.
tap in merchant
Cold blooded assassin, he is!!!
I genuinely don’t think he’s gonna be good when he’s a bit older? I think he’ll go to Madrid and die down...
I wanna see this guy in the prem
He’ll be the next generation’s fenomeno, more often then not he has more goals than appearances 😱
Flipping executor ⚡️😭
Man utd missed a good one with him :(
That second goal would be offside in the Premier League. FACT.
The defense though
Him and mbappe next big rivalry in football after messi and ronaldo
this guy is special
If he is that good now, imagine how many he will score aged 25 in Bayern shirt
So when is he joining Leeds? 😂
Is it really necessary to replay a tap in four times? Ffs
If this guy joins Manchester Utd..he’ll ruin his career, like other players who joined & left
Liverpool front three are best in world football. Sslah. Mane, Jota,
He should been playing in Premier league he to good for Dortmund.
U could call it a tap in but also great awareness and positioning
What kind of defending was this hahahahhaa
im livid man utd missed out on him. what a footballer and he's only going to get better.
IF HE PLAYED FOR SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY, WE WOULD STILL LOSE.
How long before he's playing in the premier League....
The scary thing is he's absolutely nowhere near his peak yet.
The definition of rapid fire goals
Man utd needs to sign haaland instead of Sancho. Rashford can play on the left wing.
Can any German speakers please translate what's being said at 2:35 please?
Welcome to Liverpool Haaland
He is next level
His runs are insane that second goal was perfect
Awful keeper 😂😂😂
🧨
Haaland is a top player, but my life this is some of the worst defending I've seen. No attempts to put a leg in, jogging back etc
GK = 🚽
Terrible terrible league full of players lacking athleticism. All four of those goals were soft, there's a reason academy players in England thrive in the Bundesliga. They don't thrive in Ligue, La Liga or Seria A.
he is the new Van Basten and that's a compliment,
best four goals i have ever seen
He is the best player👌. More then Ronaldo and Messi
What a player. He's better than Mbappe and Mbappe is an incredible talent in his own right.
It will take the crown jewels to prize him away from Dortmund. Barca or Real Madrid, perhaps ?
Haland is incredible
United messes up on his signing, sancho amd grealish lol. Club run by piss heads
Boyate keeps blaming others and complaining when he was at fault for the goals. Haaland is just too good though!
He has such a weird running style not in a bad way but never seen anything like that 👀
City need to sign this man ASAP. Any price, they need to sign him
#20 needs to have a word with himself. First goal he's the man marking Haaland and just gives up making sure the ball doesn't reach him - and from there on instead of taking responsibility he just seems to drift around in a vaguely defensive position. For someone wearing an arm-band that is disappointing.
As a united fan im not mad at the moments ahahahahhahahaha
His totw card best be useable !!!!
I like it when Haaland is calm when he has the ball
Great goals great pass from Bellingham and nice to see someone  pick someone up if they have fallen down he could have been injured well done Dortmund.
He’s so sick!
Haaland is the new Cristiano Ronaldo, only with R9's goalscoring at such a young age.
Think the next club for Haaland has to be Liverpool. Imagine Klopp working with him!!!
Was the goalkeeper at his debut in Bundesliga? 😅
More dangerous than Brevik
I'm not sure he's at BVB next summer.. what a talent this guy is, not just potential, he's the real deal.
Imagine being the youngest player in the league's history an still not being the main headline
Bayerns next striker 💯
1:41   That Hertha Berlin centre back was moaning at his teammates for the first 2 goals then gave absolutely minimal effort for that third.  He could see Haaland might get it when he was about 40 yards from his own goal, but didn't start sprinting until he was inside his own 18 yard box... If he'd sprinted straight away he couldve either made a challenge on Haaland as he rounded the keeper, or forced him to go near post which was harder.  Disgraceful effort
Nice inform for him on Wednesday
Cant wait to see who gets golden boot this season. Lewandowski who I consider to be the best player in the world right now or the golden boy.
he gives me ibra vibes. not just how he plays but his interviews also.
Legend has it that Ivan Drago fled Soviet Russia after his defeat to Rocky and settled in Norway.
Why wouldn't they show the full highlights??
My nan would score 4 every week playing against those defences 🙄💁‍♂️
Manchester United should buy boyota to strengthen their defence
Looks like the boy from Leeds made it. Just wish he chose to represent England😜
Think bayern have found lewas successor
One of the major things I love about him is he seems like he’s just having fun.    Seems so simple for him to score
I’d love to see him in the premier
He’s like a better ibrahimovic
Watch his celebration for the 3rd 🌚
Amazing player. Clinical finishing. But what on earth is that backline doing? Top 5 strikers in the world and he isn't man marked at all? Made Boyata look like a 14 year old
excited to see him in the Blue side of Manchester, what a player!!!
He looks like a burns victim..... probably cause he's always on fire 🔥🔥🔥
Shocking defending in the Bundesliga
I'm a man United fan but I think man City would be a good move for haaland. City need to replace aguero and haaland would take them to the next level,  and the amount of talented players City has means he'll enjoy his football there.
I’m sorry but the keeper is woeful. Haaland is incredible
Him and Lingard are the most promising young talents in the world.
Good enough to start in any team
Whoreland
He’s special but very awkward and raw
Unreal Haaland
2:51 bellingham helping the opposition player up instead of going to celebrate his assist👍👍
His movement and positioning is world class. He's so fast too.
Think he’s good now? Just wait until we wears long sleeve shirts
He seems more like the Golden Man
Get it up ye Boyata
Have to keep skipping cuz they show about 20 replays per goal
next destination: Chelsea, City or Madrid.
Matter of time before the galacticos come knocking 👌
Please sign him to replace aguero city
Man is broken hahahaha
How is he still playing for Dortmund no disrespect to Dortmund but damn this guy is world class
He’s a monster
Glad to see boyata is doing so well
Bayern Munich like this video.
absolute beast.
The boy has absolutely everything
But can he do it on wet night at stoke
He must be so glad he didn't go to UTD
Hope he stays at Dormund, Bayern can take Mbappe instead. Replacing the old BarcaMessi/MadridRonaldo on the world stage.
that second goal was poor defending
That’s one ugly potato
Probably the best golden boy ever..
Defending has got worse idc
“Alderete” “from” “those” “highlights” “seemed” “terrible”. “Fkn” “terrible”. “Seemed” “fkn” “lazy”, “un-athletic”, “lacking” “motivation”, “urgency”, “awareness”, “intelligence” “nd” “probably” “lacking” “elsewhere” “in” “conjunction” “to” “preciously” “mentioned” “areas”.
Move over lewandowski
He’ll do a cracking job at Bayern 😂
2:34
Hes younger than all of these players, yet its like men against boys 😐
to work hard and smile
Great goals but the goalkeeping on the second one was shocking 😂
Love to see him playing in a leeds shirt
Would love to see a Liverpool Shirt on him in January.
Welcome to Liverpool Haaland
10k bet that United fans start saying there in transfer talks with him.
At the moment he is the best striker in the world.
Couldn’t do it in the prem
Haaland and Mbappe the new Messi and Ronaldo 🤩
MANCHILD
Dortmund never fail to sign the best young future players. From Sancho to Haland to Bellingham. My favourite team for this reason.
Inevitable that every club will be linked with him for next summer's transfer window. What a player!
Got nothing on Tammy Abraham
Haaland was so good that BT Sport didn't even bother to show the highlights of the actual game, instead they decided to show the highlights of Haaland's goals.
My guy is clever af, his movement is sublime, that's why he can't stop scoring.
Van basten 2.0
golden boy? More like golden boot
Reminds me of a slightly worse r9
No one is leaving dortmund. They will be the best team in europe in 2 years..
The first goal is textbook & executed to complete perfection 💯👌
Lingard was robbed.
Power positioning pace drubbling accuracy almost a complete striker and he's only 20. Could be up there as one of the all time greats if he keeps progressing.
He's a Premier League striker playing in League 2.
is ANYBODY GONNA MENTION HOW BAD THAT DEFENCE IS??????????
Just reminds me of ibra. The attitude, swagger, ability. Just brilliant.
I can’t name a better striker or even player than this lad right now. What a machine.
Why was the black dude angry it was is man😂😂
Liverpool are fools for not getting this guy
Derek boyata does a lot of shouting at other people for goals he is at fault for. Done the same at Celtic. Thinks he’s better then he actually is
Very bad defending for the first 2.   2nd is a joke
Jose needs to look at him. Bring him to spurs!!
Kane or Haaland? Still would have Kane, just, but this lad is quality
I didn't know he could run so quickly.
The finishing is lethal buts it’s his ability to evade defenders that is key .
He's only going to get better. Phenom.
Great decision by the linesman for his 2nd goal, tough to see that in real time
Boyata wouldn’t get a game Sunday league
Imagine if Real Madrid get mbappe and Haaland
If that was in the Premier league the second goal would have been disallowed for his finger being offside.....
It's scary to think how good this lad will be in his mid-late 20's I always believe Strikers get more lethal with age with positioning experience + movement.. I'll be really suprised if he doesn't see a Ballon D'or at some point in his career, I would love to see him at Chelsea but wherever he ends up (i assume Barca / Real) They are going to have some player on their hands.
He makes it look so easy just like playing FIFA on PlayStation lol
With that kind of Defense, I would have scored 4 more and I don’t even play football.
Can’t wait to see him at man city
One word phenomenal 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
He will be at Liverpool soon
that boy can shift
Right now best striker on the planet good to watch
Needs 20% more replays. 🤦🏽‍♂️
top player. but my nan could defend better than these lot
this commentator is terrible
What a all round player haaland is. Amazing attitude great movement. He's really gonna be something special in the next few seasons
Wooooow, who is the messi or ronaldo against haaland?! 🙈🙈🙈😁
If this guy learns how to score headers like Ronaldo it’s game over. Honestly might be the best finisher we have EVER seen on a football pitch and I don’t think that’s overstating things
Not seen anyone as good as this young lad is phenomenal
Haaland  is a freak.. he's going to be top of the pile for the next 15 years..  Though Bellingham impressed me more in this game, he is starting to show that his potential is uncapped too.... The Dortmund project is finally starting to show what it can do... scary to think of the level of player behind them too... gio reyna, moukouko etc... wow
And people think Sancho will be expensive.
He reminds me of Harry kane but with pace he's so insane.
Haaland>Harry Kane
What a baller.. dudes face is creepy tho Haha
farmers league
The Norwegian Luca Toni
Haaland isn't a future prospect or golden boy. He's a golden player and already one of the top 5 players on the planet
sunday  league goal keeper lol
Fifa still won’t give him a second IF
Not only is his finishing clinical, is off the ball movement and positioning is incredible
Come on guys the first video was a tap in we don't really need 5 camera angles of a tap in  His last goal was class tho
Best striker on the planet
He is so deceptively quick.  Never thought he was that fast untill I watched this
That reaction from the defender for the 2nd goal was actually priceless 😂
Haaland>Mbappe
what a beast
JUST LIKE OLUGA FROM KENYA
Can I just remind everyone this was Haaland's 100th Club goal and his 106th goal in his entire career in just 148 appearances at senior level and is barely just 20 years of age
Haaland transfer to Bayern Munich 2021 confirmed 🤔😂
Ronaldo O Fenômeno should be scared
2:58 "F**k me"  Lol.
Haaland has the potential to be the best when ronaldo and messi retire
Yeah, OK, but Hertha would be a Championship team in England. Come and prove yourself in the Prem, Haaland.
Crazy finishing, crazy positioning, crazy speed & strength
Haaland is better than mbappe 110%
Like come on man, this isn't fair, dortmund paid £20m, like wtf the man is Bican incarnate
I love that he is like an old school striker !! Ball net goal
am so glad as a Utd fan he never game  we would have kill his confidence with out league 2 tactics
Listen I’m a massive mbappe fan but I have to admit I really do think he can give him a real run for his money
If he scored headers he would have Ronaldo potential
Farmers league
He’s scary good for his age.
Brandt is underrated
Dortmund when it comes to young players with potential are unreal.  They currently have  Haaland 20  Sancho 20  Reyna 17 Bellingham 17 And now Moukoko who has just turned 16 (his youth record is ridiculous)
Keeper was terrible
Meanwhile my fellow united fans think rashford and martial are world class
He's like left footed Zlatan but with pace
Horland
Farmers league
The thing is that’s the problem is he will probably lose his pace at about 25 ish
He has the best technically gifted shot at pace, in the world.
His top speed is unbelievable
Next superstar. Generational talent
Imo mbappe and halland will be the rivalry after messi and ronaldo era comes to and en d
This is why he deserves the golden boy award
This guy is a gift that is keeps on giving, what a player.
He is literally a weapon
Get this man to the prem
Great finishing yes, but the defending is honestly terrible. I think I've seen better at Sunday league fixtures.
Golekeeper should be swallowing the first ball in from can 😵
That Hertha kit is seriously cool
Most impressive to me if his ability on the ball and composure whilst running at absolutely top speed. Always balanced, always  knows what to do and an absolute killer of a left foot
wish he chose England
Isn’t it crazy that Lewandowski is just doing the same thing as this but we’re just so use to it at this point...
Bayerns future looks bright!!!
this guy is deadly
This guy is a baller no doubt, he’s a new type of player just one of a kind.
If he improves his turning den he is the best striker a team could ever imagine for imagine him in the prem
a true number 9, world class.
I love it when big stars emerge from nations that aren't known for great football. His future as well as Norway's should be interesting.
Take nothing away from Haaland but the bundesliga looks trash, always so much room for attackers
All I know is that he is coming to Liverpool ;-)
Can we appreciate bellingham on his assist, doesn’t run to haaland but helps the opposition player back up
jesus great goals but the defending is just laughable!
Well done woodward..
How’s Haaland only got 84 pace on Fifa 🤯🤯🤯
.................Mbappe  haland    Vinicius                              Asensio                Valverde.  Odegarrd  Alaba.   Verane.      Ramos.    Carvajal                         Courtois
Zlatan 2.0
BITW
Looking at his physic and technique  he is gonna be the face of  football.
Man utd, Man City, Real, Barca, Bayern and probably Juve will be after his signature. All of these teams are either lacking a finisher, or have an aging finisher. Haalaand will go for a record fee!
As an ex striker the movement for the second goal was exceptional.
The timing of his run on the second goal was inch perfect, he’s absolutely phenomenal
Love watching him smash defenders out of the way and netto...Glad Bellingham went there he looks to be improving all the time....All the best
Hard to measure just how good this guy could end up, Ive seen some talents over the years but I think he might just be the best.
Jesus... Someone's going to get a bargain on him in a year
golden boy GOAT
I'd love to see him in the Premier league
What happened to the bang average jadon sancho, who's hyped up by the English media
The next £150+ million player. Deadly.
Real Madrid scout watching like 👁👄👁
Just a rich mans patrick bamford
Not hard in a farmers league
Imagine if he played for Bayern Munich. Can't imagine how many goals he would have had
There are Fifa98 goalkeepers with better reactions than Hertha's current keeper 🤦🏾
Man Utd should put 300 million down for Haland and Sancho. Get it done.
Don’t see many players jump with joy after they score these days, nice to see. Proper striker. Glad we can watch him for the next 15 years
Without doubt going to be the best striker in the world
Farmers league
Dortmund won’t get hold of him at the end of the season, 🔥such a great goalscorer
How Boyata is a defender I'll never know. Terrible at celtic, still just as bad. Has no idea what's going on around him
It's Haaland's world, we just live in it.
Imagine if wrexham bought Haaland, her score over 120goals in that league 😂
Not showing the full highlights anymore?
Can’t see him at Dortmund for long. Not the most exciting league. Let’s see him in a top club in England, Spain or Italy.💪
Watch Real Madrid get ahold of him and ruin him.
Future goat
Bellingham and haaland link up looks good
The next lewandowski
Fast strong
This guy would do well in the prem
Really enjoy watching Haaland recently, I bet however there’s a small part of him that feels guilty of robbing Alphonso Davies for the Golden Boy award...
Just get him klopp will ya
Whatever Haaland goes onto achieve in the future, helping Dortmund end Bayern's dominance would be up there with his best achievements. I'm sure most of us neutrals are rooting for Dortmund this season.
no doubt bayern will come calling once lewa is done
One of that key solution to Real Madrid’s lack of goals. They need him badly.😄
Let’s play this game Haaland or mabpe ? 😂
In the prem the second goal would have been offside for sure
His going to Bayern in 4 years enjoy him at Dortmund
Any player at any level who can score nine goals in one game, that is 3 hat tricks  ffs . . . . . has to be considered to be world class . . . . and he has lived up to that, and just keeps sticking it to everyone who gets in his way . . . . . `A True Viking`!!!!!   long may he reign. :)
Dortmund really need to win the league with all these players otherwise it’s a failure
Now all he needs is a decent celebration 😅
He’s just showing the haters he deserved the golden boy award
I'd take him over Mbappe as over the years I think he will be less of a Diva/problematic than Mbappe might be
Haaland’s having to step his game up now Moukoko is in the first team! 😂😂
How on earth at his age, is he scoring like this? I can’t remember many young players like him even get in the first team at that age, let alone score so many goals with ease. Amazing.
Like to see him do that against the big teams
I think the fact that the next biggest talent came on for his debut is more important
His pace power technique finishing is frightning! Only way up for this guy. Future ballon dor winner
best young striker in the world easily
Beast
The thing about haaland,    Read more
No doubt he’s gonna be the best striker in the world in a few years Never seen a striker who scored goals as easily as Haaland Ronaldo vs Messi has now become Haaland vs Mbappe
Great for the modern times however I think ronaldo will finish the greatest goalscorer of all time and it’ll last forever
Haaland is amazing but he scores mainly tap ins      Positioning:99
Are him and verstappen the same person???
He runs like a psychopath
And he’s a Leeds United fan
The real question him or Lewandowlski
If he has a long career and avoids any big injury I actually think the lad will get around or about the sort of goal numbers cr7 and messi have
He’ll be a worthy successor to ronaldo Real Madrid still feeling the loss while his single handily winning games for juve imagine him and mbappe in the same team 🤞
i was seeing comments of people saying he didnt deserve golden boy  😂😂😂😂😂
He is only 20 that is not normal
Madrid or Barca is the next destination for him. Mbappe on one team, Haaland on other to create Messi vs Ronaldo again
Real Madrid and Barcelona are currently watching*
He is undoubtedly an impressive player, but the defending for all of his goals was truly awful.
New Prime Theo Walcott XD.
Why do Bt Sport upload highlights like they're a 3rd party company now-a-days 🥴🥴 whats with the zoom loool
Stunning....those defenders were just straight up terrified and who can blame them.
He, not a boy, he is a Beast.
Haaland need to come to barca
He is not the next ronaldo, he is erling haaland
Bless his great talent and work ethic. All the best , amazing to see someone with such incredible potential
Haaland is a Lethal Autonomous Weapons  experiment gone wrong. During the project he went rogue and escaped from the lab, running free down the remote Scandanavian mountains. Now all he does is score goals and eat raw tuna
Haaland and mbappe are the future whos better?
I'm sorry but that defending.....
first dislike ;)
Incoming another Bundesliga video "Erling Haaland - 23 Goals in Only 22 Bundesliga Games"
Not a single dislike so far and over 300 likes. Nice!
And haaland is only an 84 rated on fifa 😑
he is the result of hitler's eugenic program for sure
At this point just call him “a goal” 🤷🏼‍♂️
when I 1st saw him I didn't think he was that good,I've definitely changed my mind,Dortmund need to build a squad which can beat bayen but definitely dont sell him to bayen
Genuinely think he's the best striker in world football atm, as quick as a winger, as big as a centre half and the most clinical finishing you'd ever expect to see
He’s a different breed
Haaland is gonna go on to break records just watch.
Only 20million
Haaland will be something else in a few years
I genuinely think Haaland is better than mbappe now
Haaland has dynamic potential
Top 5 Sts in the world right now
Gotta think he's taking Benzema's spot eventually!
Best attacking positioning I have ever seen
Future ballon d'or winner.
Soo happy bt didn't do the same thing by posting the vid 1 day after the game
2:47 this should be his trademark celebration along with the yoga stance
His scoring record for a 20-year-old is madness, 31 goals in 30 games for BVB now. The next great striker of our generation for sure
Zlatan 2.0
His positioning and finishing are elite
Who tf programmed this robot man
What a player
This guy is too good
haaland will be the best player in the world
He's going to be on Ronaldo level one day
Haaland is playing on beginner difficulty at this point
YASS
Third

I don't think Haaland actually has a cap on his potential.

Hes a freak!

Hi
