I wish I could give you a like every time I watch this 😁
Such beautiful singers, both them❤
Ohhhhhh just revisiting some old videos.....Can you do this one again ????? Savanna is a bit older and seems so much more confident and to get this one out there again would be awesome !
Amazing harmonies.. thank you for sharing!
🧡
Cute duet of daddy, daughter ❤🎵
My favorite. Never gets old!
I can see how much she's changed over the years. 😊
The best!
Love you guys!!!
I keep coming to listen! And the marvelous man on the piano. I just love this!  So many typing errors! Had to edit!
The piano player is pure gold.
Love this song!! When my mom kicked me out of her home, this was the song that popped into my head and helped me through a really rough time. Thanks so much!!!
Still one of my favorites ❤️
A lovely young woman with great talent!  Nice complementary duet.
Loved your singing and you are so lucky having the talented and brilliant Stephen Nelson .
This is a departure from your typical emotional ballads…what a wonderfully different side to y’all!  Loved it!!
Fabulous arrangement!
I've so enjoyed your uplifting music! The Fly Away mashup is my favorite.  It'd be wonderful to see y'all perform more jazzy songs like this!
Mat and Savanna, You get more incredible each time I hear you. Such charm and beautiful blending of voices! Your fans who always support you ❤😊🤗🥰
Not the right song for your voices! Sorry
Love the spirited performance,  and terrific piano playing
Perfect!!!!!! Thanks a lot.
She is so good in this - power and animation that she doesn't show too often.  She tends to be reserved and Matt is the animated one.  Loved this and I want more, please.
385 people are tone deaf...along with anyone else who does not hear the beauty in these voices..Piana man good job too.

Beautiful tones!!  Wonderful pianist!!
Love 💓 This Special Song'🎶 "Fly Me To The Moon"      Thank -You 💐       Mat & Savanna Shaw For Singing it and Bringing  Some Much Needed Happiness To Everyone Else.👏
Congrats savanna
Congrats savva
Listening a year later (9/21) first time I realized the piano background you guys have is an actual player - so good - always thought you were singing to prerecorded background music.  Think this is one of your best. One critique - a lot of your songs seem a little too high pitch for Savannah's voice.
Incredible
Amazing everyone!!!
Fabulous all of you , what an amazing pianist !
You are very good
Two modern Frank&Nancy Sinatra!. U're marvelous!.
You 2 are the BEST!!! Love this song, upbeat, beautiful harmony once again you smashed it!!!!👍👏👏👏👏👏
Voices from heaven!  Love your pianist and he is another great vocalist.
So so awesome love it
Missed this one somehow darn it is so so so good guys well done shivers down the spine how you held those notes in the mixup wow

Stephen Nelson, when can we hear your lovely voice again?
This is a fun song and you can tell you both had fun singing it so it was fun to watch and listen to. 😍
Super fun...
This is by far my favorite trio of yours because let's face it...your pianist is phenomenal. Would love to hear you do more music in the big band, swing, vocal jazz genre! Always a fan of all you do from one musician to another!
This was another amazing job by all.
to Peru?
I’ve been listening to your songs for a couple of hours now, and this is easily my favorite. Did you arrange this yourself?! It’s brilliant! Pretty complex stuff. I enjoyed most of them but can’t praise this one enough! Really outstanding! Thank you!
WOW
Such amazing talent❤️😊
YOU ARE THE VERY BEST
Wow Iam in love from Germany ❤️🙏🙋‍♀️🤟
Love it!!!  And that piano player - WOW!!
That's awesome!  You're teaching your girl the old classics and you nailed it!

Where did these two come from...?     What amazing Talent... Thank you God.
Simply PERFECT!!! I love this mashup soooo much. Thank you for brightening my day. 😘❤️
Love the tone of the piano.
How far you have come since your first video is amazing! Far you have come meaning subscribers and equipment! Your voices are amazing! I wish my Dad still were singing. I sing all the time, I am not nearly as good as Savanna is though.
Blessings❤️
Oh Wow!  Who does your arrangements?  I'm loving them all. You two are like a breath of fresh air!  🤩🤩
Incredible trio!!! Wowowowowow
Perhaps phrase it this way. Like a bird 🐦 about to soar away to greatness?
Savanna you are so in control. What a metamorphosis. You remind me of a bird 🐦 taking her first flight. I can assure you that you will, very soon, be the talk of the town. Mat and the gifted pianist raises this performance to another level.
Great. Savanna what maturity. Lovely.

Not only I love your voices, but I like what I see.  When you started videotaping, you were all nervous and tense, now I see confidence.  Love it!!!
I would love to hear you guys do Let there be peace on earth 🌎 it's one of my favorite Christmas song 🎵
Wonderful to hear these songs again!!!! I have enjoyed them both for years. Must have been the pianist who did the mash-up?
Just beautiful blending of your voices. Thanks, Mat and Savannah. The best Duet.
I have listen to this one numerous times...it just makes me smile!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😘👋👋👋
I can’t get enough of you all !!! I love the family photo in the background !!!
Timings and harmony - just wonderful!
Outstanding!
Love it!
Love watching and listening to you two for a couple of months now but watching this performance something else caught my eye. As a retired portrait photographer I couldn't help but notice that wonderful family portrait in the background. Kudos. to the photographer. Oh and I should not forget that wonderful pianist.
Mat and Savannah you not only sing and harmonize great, but your new song "Picture This" is so well written and sung!  Keep on doing what your doing.  I love your music and now have your CD!  Keep on you both are both becoming super stars.  Love you and the Shaw family!  Carole Benner , MD
Love, love, love this!!
One of my favourite songs 👏❤️
Love!!!
Perfect connection ever

God is truly blessing you both every single day!

The pianist and the Shaws just sound like magic! Great gob guys!
I can’t handle how much I LOVE your voices! I’m gonna lose my mind 😂
This my favorite Mat and Savanna Shaw song.  I'm so glad it's on the album. :-)
That was your best performance ie you both looked relaxed and like your truly enjoyed the song.
Savannah has really opened up....great duet!
Can't tell you how uplifting it is to see the two of you sing together! It is a bright light in a very dark time of our lives...
Just great! Please do more!
Wow ...what talent !
Great arrangement 😊 sounds awesome with the piano. Hello to the pianist. I just love listening to you two! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Brillant,
Disney movie vibes - you two cease to disappoint video after video.  Kudos to piano guy as well.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️👋👋👋👋👋
Love the live accompaniment.  Who is he ?
Exciting performances, with great piano accompaniment.  Keeps getting better!!!!  Bellmore, USA
Yes old Christmas songs  Silent Night  Ole Holy Night  Are some that y’all could sing so beautifully
Love this - fab job!
Pianist was amazing!
SO much FUN!! What a great arrangement, and as always, your voices blend so beautifully together! Fun to see y’all getting so animated and really enjoying yourselves. This is making me crave a Christmas album from Savanna and Mat. Might there be one in the works? Congratulations on your first release! Excited to continue following y’all!

Sorry, don't care for this song.
Wonderful!!! The pianist is awesome!
Oh I just saw this.... wow!  The arrangement is so exciting!
Wow! Awesome!!!
💕💕💕💕💕👋👋👋👋👋
Pianist did a fantastic job. I've played this song often. Although the notes aren't that hard, the timing is particulary complex. He did a great job.
Really enjoying these duets. I'd love to hear "You're Just in Love", from "Call me Madam"; my Mom and I used to sing it. Very nice accompaniment!
Wonderful wonderful mash up ❤️❤️❤️
So, now it's confirmed. It's not their cat that's playing the piano. And this guy's a great pianist, too. Beautiful music you're making, you guys! Keep it up!
Super singers and pianist!
Absolutely love this... it is literally musical velvet to my hearing impaired ears & I shall be going to bed dreaming of the images conjured up by your beautiful voices accompanied by your sublime pianist! Thank you for sharing your wonderful energy & passion for music... more please!!!
I smiled the whole time. So beautiful.  Thank you.
Smashing!!!!
So fun!
Beautiful ♥️♥️♥️
I promise to buy everyone of your albums, I love your singing!
Very good.  I love how you changed the Tempo.  Who's your pianist??  He is wonderful to watch!!
Particularly love this one watching Savannah grow in confidence and feeling free ~ Love the harmonies, all the very best you two.
This made me get up and dance!!! You two bring such joy in my life. And my 4 yrs old loves loves loves your channel🥰🙏💝
Marvellous!!! And the pianist who accompanied you was brilliant, too ♥
I don't know how it sounds like you just keep getting better because You've always been good. I really enjoy listening to you both. Thank you for sharing.
What a great arrangement, and love the guy on the piano
How can anyone dislike??? 🤪
Such a fun song. Sounds amazing as usual!
It’s great to see you both enjoying singing and love your music
I listen to this song umpteen times a day, but now I have a question I hope you don't mind answering.  The guy playing piano, does he play by ear and does he do his own arrangements of music for all the songs you sing.  I love to watch him play the piano.  I love to watch you two sing and watch him play the piano.  Such a wonderful combination!!!
I love how he can't stop smiling in pride for his daughter - who is rocking the music style!
I was wondering if you two wonderful singers could pulled off swing.....you can!!!!
W-O-W!!! I've watched this video so many times and I just feel in awe every time. A whole extraordinary performance of you three!
Just came out of surgery and was feeling down and turned on YouTube to see y'all singing such a happy and hopeful song. Brought me happy thoughts. Thanks
Wow, love this and oh man, the pianist is phenomenal! That harmony from Matt and Savannah is amazing! More than professional!
i really loved everything about the performance. having a "live" piano really takes everything to a higher level! The pianist was great as were the two of you!!!!!!
Have to listen twice. One to watch you and one to watch your fantastic panio player... Please bring him on more.
I so much enjoy listening and watching you two sing to us. It has to be such a joy to perform with your daughter, Savanna . I know you are so proud of her , and to share your talents with us has to make you, Dad, so happy. I wish you two all the best and good will. Enjoy
You should consider adopting Stephen Nelson and his piano.
My favorite song.
I love listening to them!
Hey Guys check out the songs by the carpenters and Dione warwick  there are a bunch of them that you would rock
Wonderful job guys and the piano player rocks!   I bet the fam is having a blast.
ABOUT TIME with the classics instead of those sappy Disney songs!
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️👋👋👋👋👋
Savanna sings like an angel, but I have to say my favorite thing is to watch Mat. He has fantastic expressions, and you can tell he feels the entire thing.
Can you put a Christmas mashup? Sure it'll be a hit!
As a fellow pianist I have to say the pianist is awesome!!!
Amazing, can't wait to buy the album. Watching this has just perked me up. Many thanks 😁👍🌈
:’))))))))))
Wow...wow!! And the piano man, he's the ideal!!!
That was awesome!
How fun and terrific! Nice to see you developing your performance aspect, Savanna....really great. Love you both, from a fellow singer and lover of music. Period.
I love Savannah and her Dad. They are so talented !! And yes the pianist is wonderful too!
Love your voices.  Great duet
Wonderful singing and amazing pianist!!!
Awesome and the pianist is amazing as well!
Beautiful a wonderful touch with the piano in back ground but a bit loud, kinda drowns out your beautiful voice,s at times. Will follow you,s to the moon and back.👏💕
Your best song yet❣️Just fits your voice and range so perfectly❣️❣️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Love the pianist! Nice chops. Can we know his name?
There's just something so likable about these two. I love it. I have this on repeat
Your nest recording yet!❤️
This is my absolute favorite from all the songs you have sung so far. You three are amazing. Please never stop singing/ playing the piano together!
Thank you to everyone involved with this performance in providing me a reason to smile and feel good this morning.  Bless you all
One of the best things to come out of lockdown. Love you pair!
Your duets are wonderful.  Your accompanist is awesome.
Perfection!!
Bravo!!! Love it
Absolutely amazing!
actual real music, thank you!!!
So beautiful!
Fabulous and the guy on the piano brilliant!
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻💕💕💕💕💕💕
Fabulous fingers on the ivories!
Love love love the energy and smiles!!!! That piano player was amazing as well! Thanks so much again, for all of your sharing this  amazing talent ya'll have with the world....a really bright spot in this crazy pandemic and strange world!!!!
love this song and performance!
What a peppy, fun song, and y'all did a splendid job singing it together!  Kudos to Stephen, the wonderful pianist.  He's such a delight to watch.  It's apparent that the three of you enjoyed making this video!  Keep up the top-notch singing.  God bless you all.
Do you all have a cd out.   I enjoy listening to y'all. These songs are very positive. This is what we need to listen to. Y'all have great voices. Keep it up. I have subscribed to your channel.
Awesome and so was the piano guy 😎
I LOVE when u r in this setting, the energy is awesome.  More of this....
What a refreshing change to listening to the ‘news’!  Upbeat, fun, & positively delightful
Absolutely fantastic. Such a very intricate but beautifully-woven mash-up. And on top of that the perfect harmonies with the key changes. OMG 🌹 I had to play this a few times, chromecasting it out loud on my TV screen. Sooooooooooo wonderful. I listen and watch ur channel every morning during breakfast. ❤️
Am loving the inflection you both put into your songs. Would love to hear what you would do with some oldies I love such as "The Harbor lights" by the Platters,  "Crazy" by Patsy Cline, "The Moon's a harsh Mistress" and "You belong to me".
Amazing how Savannah gets more confident with every song! Love these two!!
Beyond lovely! Thank you for making 2020 a lot better!
wow, even that pianist is amazingly talented.
Once i saw your youtube i just fall in love with your voices. Bravo you are such a perfect duet. Love you both ...
Nice
👍🏻
Wow what a great job! you both sound so good together! I Liked and subscribed! Please do the same for me
A-MA-ZING!!! 😍
Loved this song
I just found you abs think you sig beautifully. Are you going to do Christmas music, I’d love to have that playing in the background while I entertain.
I love these old songs.  Wonderful job.
I’m a fan!  I always enjoy your music, but must say this is my least favorite song. You both look like you enjoyed singing it, but I’m not a big fan of old standards.
Absolutely amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Beautiful duet! And yeah, piano man is very talented!
Bravo.  Love it!
This channel is just over  a month old and they have nearly 525K subscribers.   Freaking amazing - and well deserved!
Phantastic voice 🤩.... thank you!! Your are great!!! Lovely greetings from Germany 🇩🇪
You both are amazingly talented! Your voices blend perfectly! Great video!❤️
Love the accompanist. Fabulous!
That was so fun to watch! It looked like the pianist had as much fun as you did.
Yalls confidence is gleaming.  I could listen all day.
A welcome and refreshing change in your repertoire. A real pleasure to listen to.
This is perfection and the most fun blend of gorgeous voices! My favorite arrangement so far.
Move over Celine and Bocelli the Shaws are the new harmony.
Love, love, love these oldies! Beautiful job, guys!🤗🥰
I feel so much better now in spite of pouring rain and Grey skies. 😁😍
Mindblowing vocals ... I could listen all day
Nostalgia 🇧🇷
I love listening to your songs you are amazing
Totally awesome !
This is my favorite yet. Love the pianist!
Love this choice of "once-upon-a-time" standards - wow!
They are both exuding confidence. I am so happy for them.
WOW! The Pianist did all of the great playing without reading music! Beautiful work, all three of you! Lovely, lovely, lovely!!!
Mat please do a cover (not a duet) of "Angels" by Rubbie Williams🤞🏼❤
I love this, Watched it many times!
You both look so energized and engaged by standing up, it comes across in your presentation both visually, as well as auditorily.  What a true joy to watch!  Congratulations on your newest success!
Wow, you’ve grown so much in confidence. Wonderful to see!
I just love listening to you guys sing! Your chemistry and your talent is enough to make my home office a front row seat to an amazing show that I look forward to every day. It doesn't just happen as easily as you two make it seem, and there's a lot of practice, fun, try this and that, key changes, trial and error, and I'm soooo flippin' happy that it's a lovely young girl and her cool kat dad that are pulling this off with hardly any squabbles :)   Please keep it real for all of us out here that just want simple right now. You two represent every little thing that goes hand in hand with success, and I'm fortunate enough to just sit here on the curb and watch your amazing parade stroll by and all the beautiful music that comes with it! Thank you for practicing and for sharing every little thing that comes with success. I'm fortunate enough to be able to just sit here and let you two work out the things that work out what does and what doesn't in your arrangements. Thank you!
Sounded great! I might be mistaken but it looked like your pianist did not even use any sheet music but had learned it by heart. Is he the same guy you've had all along but has moved so he could be there with you?
Just watched your first video again. Boy have you two gotten better.
A fan from the start here. I think the pianist is so much better than the lamp that they had in the background in their first videos! I went back and listened to when they first started to sing and now this. So much growth in such a short time. It is hard to tell that Savanna was so shy in the beginning. She is starting to glow and Mat is strong as ever. I wish the best for you both.
Wow! This is wonderful. I miss the old songs like this one, so upbeat. Please make more of these! And I agree with the plea for you to make a Christmas collection of songs
Sure Suznet 555 the Pianist is amazing too. Waiting to my daughter play like that one day.
Both of you are amazing. I would love have a Christmas CD with you guys.
Amazing love you too keep up the amazing work
Savannah is getting beautiful and beautiful 😍
You and your father look so lovely and sweet and the amazing voice
Can you please sing “you are my home” from the Scarlet Pimpernel??
Stunning!
I love these two talented people.
So uplifting. Just wonderful.
this just brightened up my day as I'm in quarantine!  Love this!!! Pianist rocking it too! Love the energy!!
Wow and more wows! A fantastic 'Trio' goin' on!
Guys, would you sing "Starry starry night" by Don McLean?
Hi Savana & Mat, I wanted to share with you another song possibility. I was watching a great movie and there was a song by Michael Bolton called "Fathers and Daughters". Google it and see what you think. God's blessings to you and your family. 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏❤❤❤❤❤❤
Damn that was impressive!!!!
Wonderful keep your pianist, he IS THE MUSIC MAN.  I want to hear more of his work.
🌼💙💙💙🎹💙💙💙
The best one yet. I loved watching you three having a great time together. Bravissimo!
Old Cape Cod would be great! I'm only a few miles from it and its a incredible place.
so much better that the two of you staring at the screen singing to pre-recorded music.  It is nice to see you so animated.
Delightful. I'd love to see your whole family.
This is fantastic! Should have a million views by now. One of my new top three favorites, and I'm a big fan.
Apparently the wonderful pianist is Stephen Nelson
PLEASE PLEASE do UP WHERE WE BELONG!!
Your pianist ia amazingly talented and matches so well with ya'll!  This is one of your best ever if you can get any better! Thank you so much for sharing your talent with us!❤
How nice to see Mr. Nelson 🙂 Miss Savanna absolutely comes alive behind the mike. Matt, your love and pride for your daughter, and your enjoyment of singing is always a joy to watch
Love this mix up..!! 🥰
Love these  two
Beautiful as always.  They don’t disappoint!   Pianist really jazzes it up. Great job.
Bravo!! Nicely done.
Além das vozes encantadoras, do talento, fico mais encantada com o olhar de orgulho do seu pai. 🇧🇷🇧🇷
Great all 3 of you x
You are my favorite singers right now. From Canada
Awesome, just awesome.
I really love this and what an amazing arrangement.
Love the addition of the live pianist! You guys are, as always, amazing. I truly hope you can get that Christmas album out by November. Can't wait!
This was AMAZING. I loved it. Thank you for sharing. I loved it that you also had a wonderful time singing it. What a joy to see you enjoying it as much as we do. Keep it up. God blessed you with that gift, and we are blessed to be able to see and hear you. Maria Isabel
Terrific piano accompaniment!
Wayfaring Stranger would be a great song for you two!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️👋👋👋👋👋
whoa, you've outdone yourselves!
CHRISTMAS ALBUM NEEDS TO HAVE THAT ONE SONG FROM ELF
Super piano player !!  What a trio !!  Cut albums
Moon , sun , and stars , I’m on my way , following you guys , day by day , just wonderful listening I must say 🤩🤩🤩
Absolutely delightful singing  and the pianist is fabulous great playing very talented
It does not matter what songs they sing they smash them so beautiful.
What a great arrangement. The pianist is amazing and the vocals are fantastic as usual. Is there a sheet music arrangement of this available anywhere?
These are my favorite Sinatra songs! I literally have tears in my eyes! Thank you!
Fantastic!! Every single note!
Amazing! Please keep this authenticity guys. Nowadays everything is fake. This brings a fresh air to real talent and music. I really appreciate all what you do to get this out for us! Keep up the good work! I am a mastering engineer by profession and I tell you this is perfect feast for the ears.
Savanna's voice has changed and the control is much better than at the start of covid.
So incredible!
The best song and arrangement yet!  Wow
Thank you! That was Fun!!
Bravo!

Missing you guys and songs waiting for more xxx
Best version ever
They make it look so easy keep it up Guys!
Can you share what you started off using to record your music?
I’m listening from Adelaide South Australia.  Just so lovely to hear both Savannah and Mat sing especially Fly Me to the Moon.  Thank you for singing and bringing so much joy to so many.  Love the pianist!
This is so sweet! As someone who lost their dad to a heart attack when I was 8 years old, I just wanna say if you're dad is still alive, give him an extra hug . Even if he's not perfect or made mistakes.
Mat and Savanna, I just love you guys' animation. What happened? Wow! Somebody brought in an excellent suggestion, I must assume, lol!
You both are very talented. I love every single song that you have sung. Keep on recording and singing together. YOU’RE GREAT 👍!!!
I love you two and the music is wonderful!
Any chance of you guys doing some songs from Dear Even Hansen? Only Us? Or Savana on Requiem? Or Matt on Words Fail? Great songs...
beautiful......
Beautiful 💖💖💖
Cracking mix up! Great singing and fab pianist!
That sounded difficult, but seamless. Well done!
Wow! Savanna has gained so much confidence since I first saw her sing. Unbelievable change and both of you are great. Loved the song....keep up the good work!
I JUST LOVE YOU TWO SO MUCH.  THANK YOU FOR LIFTING MY SPIRITS.  LOVE. JANE IN S.C.
Yep, the pianist's sooo good!
Next time, consider thanking the excellent accompanist.
Oh wow, this is fantastic!!
I don’t comment often but this is OUTSTANDING!!! This is your best one yet!!! Love that the pianist is live with you. Really adds to the performance. Thank you for such a beautiful bright lift!!!! Thank you for gifting the world with your heartfelt talent!!
Wonderful mash up!
Very very nice!!
Wow! She is coming out of her shell. Awesome!
So fun! Loved it
absolutely loved this and especially watching the pianist.  Awesome.
Absolutely fabulous!!! Love the pianist too!!!
Bravo to Everyone; especially the family that’s...off screen:)
Love the performance!!
have you two considered making a cover of "hallelujah"? (sorry, not sure of spelling)    I keep thinking of how great it would sound..definitely worth considering, I think
That was fabulous!
AMAZING
I would love to hear you both sing Send in the clowns. I think you would do it a great justice
Wow, awesome I love Sinatra and songs from that era  you do  wonderful job and love adding p
I forward this to my sister who use to lives in Australia now at 75. She use to dance and sing with our DAD up until she was 10. Unfortunately he was killed in a freak accident fixing a vehicle. Her comment was....”I wonder what we could have gone on to do if he had lived “
Yes the pianist is awesome 👏🏻 Super addition ❤️
it’s so inspiring to see you guys have so much fun with music ☺️💓 thank you for bringing joy to the world
Outstanding!
You guys are just pure amazing 💕 how can you perfectly blended so well! I'm dancing this song seating, standing, etc. Just so much fun. I'm sure you guys had fun making this cover up!
Love it!   How about singing “Hushabye Mountain” from Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.... I love that song & I reckon you two could really make it special! 🤗
Awesome!!! Your voices are so so beautiful! Many greetings from Switzerland! 😊 Beatrice
Окремо - піаніст 👍👏👏👏. Молодці 👍👏👏👏👏💪
I always end up with a smile on my face when I listen to Mat and Savanna sing. Today I noticed even the pianist is smiling!  You just can't help yourself!
I would buy a a nice relaxing lounging compilation like this from you! Love it.
Молодцы
Great to see you back guys. I have missed you. Good to see the piano player too.

Always so uplifting. Love  watching them
U could win AGT or any talent show
Wow, so amazing and beautiful how your voices blend together. I love the piano accompaniment. Bravo!! 😊❤️
This rendition is great! You three are amazing artists! Now, if you can’t sing “Unforgettable “ by Nat King Cole with Natalie singing over the original recording, please tell me so I don’t keep hoping 🙂
Thank you for this beautiful moment. Carry on, you fill my heart with love
Thanks for this!!! Smiled the whole song through!!
Loved this - all of it, harmonization, the energy, the pianist and savannah and mat.
Your growth and confidence is astounding. Beautiful arrangement and I can’t wait to see you fly to stardom. Love the piano.
I was just listening to this by frank Sinatra.  Fun!
Thanks Pianist , thanks Daughter and Father so much. I can fly together to the moon with you guys. Love this song so much.
You really nailed Fly Me to the Moon Mat!
Fantastic!!!!!
I absolutely love Sinatra! Great rendition of his songs that I soooo love! Keep singing y’all!
I would pay to go see you in concert.  Seriously.  Come visit Florida....(Brevard County specifically...)
Pianist is just as great!
Love the piano player!! He needs to take a bow..
Wow! Fantastic job from all of you!! You must be having so much fun doing this!!
Nice!! What a treat to see your pianist with you  in this video. He is AWESOME!!!!!
Wow! Great job with this mashup!  I love your accompanist and feel this song highlights all of the talent and musical gift each of you 3 musicians has.  I also love reading in the comments how much your songs have helped people through with their recent or current challenges and trials.  Brilliant!   🤗😊🥰🤗😊🥰❤🥰😊🤗🥰😊🤗
Omg. .beautiful!! Can't wait for your album!!
Took my breath away !!
More like a trio. The pianist's arrangements are AWESOME! Nice to see him now!
PERFECT
Great cover! You both have such amazing voices. Check out my cover of this song on Sunday!
This is soooooo great❗️ What a perfect medley and they are having a lot of fun. Bravo Savana,  Mat and Stephen.  👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
WOW! this was amazing!
You see when it goes from karaoke (not a negative comment) to a full live performance with a human interaction with the piano it does not go up a notch it soars above. That is the real beauty of live performance when each artist interacts so subtly with the others . Magnificent just magnificent .
SO GOOD!  And a big shout out to the pianist!
You should try to sing «lift me» by madrugada. Norwegian band. 👍
Love the jazz music of the pianist! The kind of music we want to listen to over and over again. Thank you for sharing with us all your God given talents. We could not get enough of your music. The three of you are perfect harmony. 🙏🏻❤️
Priceless
The https://youtu.be/5pQvM9ZY41k things to come
Looks like you are having fun. It was fun listening and watching!
I love the combo of these two songs and the way you've fit them together, they work beautifully as a mashup. Props to your accompanist too 👏
Fantastic and so much fun! Bravo to your accompanist! Thank you!
Indeed the pianist perfectly match with their perfect pitch. Good show
Please please please sing the Christmas song "Were You There on that Christmas Night"... My life will be complete to hear your voices blend in such a beautiful song!!!
Hello from Clinton just up the road.  I think that with the type music you guys sing, you would do a great job with "Unchained Melody" by the Righteous Brothers (might be a little before both your times).  Great job guys, I think that you both sing great.
This just made me SMILE!  Thank you for bringing so much joy.
Wonderful
It’s my dad’s birthday today.  I rarely cry, but your song Fall on Me found me in tears.  My earthly father did not have it to give... but I have found the last 31 years that my Heavenly Father has always been there and never disappoints.  I tried to imagine what it would feel like to have an earthly father like that, including gazing at me as if I was a Princess.  Then I saw Mat’s smile and look of adoration toward his daughter.... and I knew.
Whaaat an awesome blend of voices and accompaniment all  together 🥰
Brilliant!  Super piano, too.  Wow!  More of this kind of thing, please?  :)
Hi, Mat and Savanna, can you sing “ When you Believe “ by Whitney Houston & Mariah Carey ?
Wow - 3 extremely talented people!!!
This couldn't be more perfect...MAT and SAVANNA ..and THAT PIANIST WITH THE MAGIC IN HIS FINGERS...I LOVE IT  <3
Love this so much.  A special shout out to your pianist.  Awesome!
Savanna you fly!  Love your duets...but you alone can soar!
I didn't get to watch this until now. What a wonderful video for my birthday!
So beautiful!. Heavenly ! The pianist is terrific.  I listen to you everyday. God bless you
Savanah, that was amazing!!! Mat, you were OK!
Fantastic piano and singing is superb!!!
This is amazing I love frank Sinatra of fly me to the moon and love u both doing so well keep it up 🙂❤️
Brilliant...a double Sinatra wammy....you both are amazing!!!!
Oh Yeah!!!

Stephen Nelson - a great intuitive pianist and perfect for this duo!!
WOW.
Outstanding performance and great voices together with that perfect framing pianist!! Thank you for your music and many greets from Germany
Thank you, thank you!  Fly me to the Moon is one of my favorite songs 💗.  That was fun 😀
Can you please do the disney songs now :)

Bravo...Bravo!!!!  Nice job very upbeat keep those old school songs alive!
Absolutely brilliant take on two fabulous songs 👍🏻❣️
Absolutely amazing!!!
Amazing! 💖
You are awesome!!
Great singing and piano compying! Savanna and Mat  ready for Broadway!
Everything about this warms my heart❤️ I love seeing Savanna so animated and so filled with glee! The pianist adds so much to your video. Matt’s voice is so amazing in everything he does. I like that Matt kept his eyes open more than I’ve seen is other videos. He’s connecting so much more with the audience that way!
Great pianist!
What an energy, girl! 💪
Love this! Great job, again! 👏🎶
Wow, what a treat that was! Absolutely Beautiful
Beautiful!
We really enjoyed the piano. How does he play without music? Such talent!
Outstanding, awsome
You are a great dad and daughter but this swing music is an acquired taste. Love the musicals though. X
Outstanding!
Great team!!
Always fun to listen to these two. Beautiful!
Waow, wat mooi! Jullie zouden in theater moeten zingen  Jullie zijn mooie mensen!
Absolutely fabulous, love listening to you both singing. Brightens my days xx
Love this version, beautiful!
WOW...WOW...,!!!💖🦩
I have to be honest and say that I love your voices, but not this song.  I just don’t like this type of song and I do not think it is the perfect fit for your voices.  I love everything else you’ve done so far.  Whether you sing together or separately, you both have excellent voices, great range and superb talent.
I love when you sing together... Your daughter’s voice has really matured wonderfully...🧐
Great to see your pianist live too and he does not need any music!!  Savanna you have such a high voice.  Have never heard Fly me to the Moon.
I love it💕
I've watched this an embarrassing number of times.
FABULOUS.All three.I'm addicted to you👏👏👏
wow, beautiful vocals
Omg omg omg...I had so much fun watching this. I love all your music but this is by far my favorite. Savanna you can see how much you enjoyed this and Mat the way you look at her is just amazing. Love you guys
Really good but your GUITAR FACE IS SO DISTRACTING !!!
Love you guys! Wholesome family entertainment! I wish you all kinds of success! I started playing the French horn in fifth grade and I got a full scholarship to Illinois Weslyan university because of the French horn and it took me to playing in the Disneyland band and the United States Air Force band as well. I’ve also been in through 12th grade general, band, orchestra, and choir. So just believe in yourself and keep going, keep sticking your neck out, which I know you’re doing!!!
Excellent
mesmerizing!!
FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Looks like her older brother😅
Stephen Nelson is amazing. What he does for Gentri is outstanding, too.
Ohhhh my gosh!  This seems soooo out of the comfort zone for you two but holy moly canolie!  It was AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  As was your pianist!  I'd love to hear more mash ups!  Outstanding!  <3
Wow.  This is definitely my new favorite y’all killed I love this song and I enjoyed y’alls rendition so much
Great Job Y’all. Another great one
Everything spot on! Do not understand all the hand movement. You both are amazing talented people taking some chances. Enjoyed your pianist!
Fun, playful, light and beautiful  -- wonderful!
Wow wow wow!!!  One wow for each person I see and hear on the screen!  So uplifting, thank you very much for sharing!
Great song with all three musicians!!!!
I can imagine a double bass and soft drum back track haha..
Wow! Amazing! I love the live piano and that you both are standing and more animated! Of course, your voices are beautiful, as always! Thank you for sharing. Such great energy.
Wow it's so so beautiful!!!
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Bravo!! Wonderful!
This one is really good
So beautiful!
Love how you are standing in front of the mics and letting go.  I look forward to seeing you live some day. Once again it was wonderful.  One day...Groban and Shaw, Clarkson and Shaw!  💕💕
Not sure why ANYONE would give you two a thumbs down unless they are completely JEALOUS!  Really you two are amazing and make me smile.  Beautiful voices!
I love seeing how proud her Dad looks when she starts singing 💖
I enjoyed seeing a more active performance instead of just sitting and singing.   This big band suits you both.
A beautiful and energetic rendition of Come Fly With Me!!  Love you guys from Canada!
Amazing job, beautiful harmony's
I´ve been there from the very beginning, watching you two grow, and I´m enjoying it so much! Keep up the good work!

Great job you two.  The piano guy was amazing.  Cheers and keep singing it really does help and heal our hearts.

BRAVO!!!!

I can’t believe you guys are doing a Christmas album!
Amazing! Nice greetings from Germany :-)

Very refreshing. You two are certainly enjoying yourselves. Love it. Glad you're expanding your music.
Wonderful singing

Another amazing performance 👍♥️.
Man, these two keep getting better and better!
Perfect, it’s a lovely combo x
What an awesome  team!  Most enjoyable, thank you.
👏👏👏this is fun and well done🤗
Loved this!  Personally, I think it's your best duet yet.  The harmonies were fantastic, and, the pianist was awesome.  I think I smiled the whole way through.
So good! So, so good!!!
This is pure joy! Pure music! Pure happiness! Pure love and passion! Pure talent!! And pure hearts that put this together!! ❤
After hearing that, I’m sure that the both of you could pull off a rendition of Frank and Nancy Sinatra’s song, “Something Stupid” beautifully....
Good job guys! It's much more lively show than before and you nailed the song too, thank you.
Fantastic arrangement
I always loved this song. I love it even more now. I loved the arrangement, and how to play the piano with joy, by Stephen! Savannah, your voice is stunning as always, and you sing with your whole body and soul. Mat, as soon as your voice comes in I get chills all over my body. Thank you!
This is amazing!! 😍
Excellent!
Brilliant as always and as others have said, how nice to finally meet the gentleman tinkling the ivories .... amazing performance from you all and so nice to hear something completely different from your usual songs. Looking forward to the next one x
GO ON BGTTT AGTT VOICE WHATEVER JUST GOOO BE MOREEEE SUCCESSFUL GUYSSSS
Wow!!!!! Just a beautiful rendition of one of my favorite songs- Fly me to the moon.
Savanna's voice is maturing dramatically every time I hear her sing.  And as duet, they really compliment each other.
Your voices are incredible. Don't see how they can get any better. Great recording
Great arrangement!
When people sing live you can hear them take breaths. I believe this is them singing with some editing, it just confuses me.  I want to love it, but theyre not being authentic.
Fabulous🤗🤗🤗
even in the Netherlands we are enjoyng your singing.  I like this Mashup. 💝
Fantastic job to all three of you ❤️
Just beautiful 🌺!!! The arrangement and the vocals! Love, love, love it! Frank Sinatra is smiling.
Go Savanna! All that confidence looks great on you😁
They did mention him in their personal comments just above his name is STEPHEN NELSON
oh wow fantastic love the changes!!
So good, so fun! Keep up the great work!
AWESOME! You hit a home run with this one! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻😍

Lionel Ritchie and Diana Ross " My endless love " would be pissah if you guys need any suggestions?.. keep up the great work! I apologize for using the word "pissah". Boston accent lol

Just too awesome for words!  Thank you so much!
Great video
This experience you are sharing together is so special ❤️ my dad passed away recently and each time I watch you sing together makes me think of how lucky you two are. Enjoy every moment because one day you will look back on these days/videos keeping your memories alive. ❤️
One of their best yet!!!
The only thing that could have made this better would have been if you sang it to each other! More eye contact!!! But it was great!!❤
Just Wow! Thanks for such an amazing rendition.
Y’all made me smile!! Loved it!
Savannah sure shined in this song! So much confidence and excitement she had. It was exceptional!
Excellent!  You've been practicing.
Excellent rendition of two great songs. Keep up the good work
I'm a puppet, yep and I'm only four, but I want to be a singer just like you Savanna. You and your Dad are WONDERFULLLLL!! I have a Children's show called, Fetch The Goodness (also knowns as Amy TV), and I'd be honored if you would sing a few songs with me. I would love to interview you and have you teach our community (homeschoolers K-5th grade) how you learned to sing with your Dad! I know how to do Zoom calls so it would be easy peasy for me to record you for our show. I'd be over the moooooooon excited! Oh! Hahaha....like "Fly Me To The Moon Excited!" Hahahaha You can write me at fetchthegoodness@gmail.com See you soon!!! BYEEEEEE!!!
Have you considered going on AGT or The Voice?
Perfect trio. Loved it.
Love you two!
Beautiful beautiful beautiful plus the pianist ♡♡♡
That was awesome!! So much fun to watch & listen to - toe tapping joy 😄
wow wow wow wow beautiful
Savanna  you not even born when that song was written
As an accompanist myself, I have to do a separate shout-out for the outstanding musician, who is YOUR accompanist. Top rate talent!!
Wow! Just, wow!!! This was the best arrangement! Showstopper! Your harmony is divine! The undertones of the song is so inspirational! I'm a lifelong fan! Never stop singing! Keep being so fresh!
You guys are amazing! Your so blessed to have your amazing voices!!
Y’all better come out with a Christmas album!!
Alrighty then!
Wow Amazing
Perfect perfect 🇧🇷
Love these two
Bravo !
Wow wow wow !
You continue a growing tradition of musical excellence!
A Star is Born! Congratulations on your success! We are all behind you! Yes! The pianist is a keeper!🥳🥳🥳
👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋
👋👋👋👋👋👋❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
I love that picture on your album I go to a doo-wop every year in New Jerseythat's the type of jackets that your dad's wearing that they wear it down I love it
Wow, my favorite so far.
Savannah, beautiful per usual. But Mat, where have you been hiding? Your ability to harmonize is outstanding! Glad to see this side project growing for both of you!
Go Savanna!! 🙂  My oh My, you get better by the day. Your singing and movements to the music are superb. Mat you are also doing fantastic. I have noticed your voice is louder; and it blends excellent with Savanna's. I am so happy you both do this. Your voices, love for each other and all your music lift my spirits everyday. Thank you both; God Bless ♥️🤗♥️
Loved the energy of you two with this song 😊
Thanks for making my day just a little Brighter by listening to this beautiful song!
A perfect match! Love your singing always.
Wow, what a pianist! The apresentation was wonderful!
Incredible!!! Thank you!
I just love you guys!  Thanks so much
Love, love, love.... ❤️❤️
There’s just something about live accompaniment that brings out the very best in all singers!  This was wonderful.  Can a trio be next?  I’m waiting for a full orchestral back-up!  You two make my day!  Thank you so very much, from Toronto.
Adorei!!!!!  beijos do Brazil...
Really nice. Great piano work !
Another amazing one!! I grew up on this song and it’s hard to compete with old “Frank” but you’ll did! Wonderful. The pianist behind added a perfect touch.  ♥️
Another amazing one!! I grew up on this song and it’s hard to compete with old “Frank” but you’ll did! Wonderful. The pianist behind added a perfect touch.  ♥️
Truly special to have the pianist and singers recording all together. What a gift--thank you!!! My little audience of one burst into thunderous applause at the end!
Love this one. I love the pianist.
Fabulous
Wooooooooooow😱
You guys are amazing! Your piano player is also amazing!
Another beautiful duet, something really different and so very enjoyable! You both are so talented end it is such a joy to listen to all of your music!
Please do la la land!!!
BEAUTIFUL!  God Bless you and your beautiful family!
This video made me smile! 😍💖
Love this! Amazing pianist too!
Wonderful duet from Melbourne,  australia.  I just loved it.  Margaret Hammon
Looks like you had fun doing this song.   Loved it
I meant to add, that Savanna you are really improving in your singing & stage presence. A good stage presence pulls the audience to you. It is not singing @ people to admire you. You are both warm & welcoming. Savanna, I especially like your natural, non exaggerated, feeling tone for the song, that you’re singing. It is good to explore different types of music & find your own niche.Your piano player is fabulous & knows how to be a great accompanist. Does he create these arrangements? I am a retired RN with a music avocation, classically trained in voice, although prefer standards/ jazz to opera. I was singing in a chorus & with a community orchestra prior to Coronavirus. Please stay safe. Jeanne
Beautiful
Loved it!  Thank you. xo
Absolutely Amazing!!! 💞
THIS is absolutely genius!!!!! Thank you so much for this great performance
And Savanna’s confidence has soared. Amazing as it shows. This is such an animated performance, full of zest for life and vigour.
Stunning as usual❤️
Your voices sound so beautiful together. It makes me smile!!!! I enjoy watching and listening...... Thanks for sharing.
Such a lovely atmosphere! Fabulous!! 💕
wow!!!!
It's just weird for a father and daughter to be singing this song to each other.  But nice voices anyway.
Oh my gosh!  That was wonderful.  I so enjoyed it.   Loved the jammin keys also,   very nice.
There were beautiful voice, cool pianist and nice family’s picture.  I felt at ease with them. My English is so poor. Sorry. I love music. I’m 70 years old. And I’m Japanese. ❤️
Wow you two look so happy well singing together you spread happiness to all, thank you so much for putting a smile on my face from the start I rlly want to be like you Savannah when I grow up!
Great job to the pianist.
BRAVO, BRAVO, that was amazing.
Absolutely loved the new twist with the piano man! Also enjoyed these nostalgic songs, good memories!!
That was fun to listen too!! What a team!
excellent arrangement, piano playing, and note perfect singing. Well done.
💕
You’re on your way to broadway!

What a rocking performance! 🤩🥰
You two are SIZZLIN'!! THANK YOU so much!! This was AWESOME!
Excellent! You’re such a joy! 👏🏻💖
What a fresh take on a couple great song!  I want more!
Love this new addition! Love the pianist too🙌🙌🙌
You look like you had a lot of fun with this one ! Beautiful again!!
You guys!!!!
Clapping right here in my living room!!!! Wow!!! I love your energy in this video, and of the course the vocals are stellar!
Beautiful, again! Savanna you are an old soul for sure. Love seeing your piano player....he does a fabulous job , as well.
I have NO WORDS! FANTASTIC! 👌
Wow! That's my new favorite! Loved the energy!
Wow...incredible singing ...and a great arrangement .... did the pianist arrange that piece?
This was fun! You can’t go wrong with Sinatra.
best video of mat and Savanna Shaw..................great mash up!!!!!
Love it!!
Amazing 💕
I love that you are more expressive with your bodies including your hands.  You do the song justice. Kudos to your piano player.
You both are truly amazing and always put a smile on my face 😊. Blessings on your  journey.
Love this jazzy compilation!
I like the arrangement.
Way too cool.
Awesome! Love you guys!
This performance really took your skills to another level!
Excellent!!!!
Wow!!! Well done...all 3 of you.
One of my all time fave songs excellent  choice. Gorgeous voices. You two are amazing
Fantastic pianist....great job on the 🎵 song.
It is so nice to be able to come see you 2 and forget about all that's going on in the US and the World...
I'm sad to say this but the standing and dancing didn't do it for me. It looked a tad awkward and it sounded to me like the vocals suffered. Please don't turn your back on the good old fashoned sitting and singing routine. It's served you very well until this point.
🙋 YES YES YES!!!!!!! Please do some Christmas🎄 smash ups like that!!!!! So fun. I'm ready for my tap shoes. Savanna, love your dress. 👗 Great job👍☺
Savannah, you look soo happy and confidence, luv it...and the piano man, gossh, what a play!!!three of you are amazing!!!
Is that Gentri's pianist? What a blessing! Could Gentri and you two work together on something in the future? The musical world might explode!
You and family are your own conscience.      I will always support you. But be careful......
Just be careful of the path your taking Matt and Savanna
I don’t understand all this.
Not as good as when you first started. But nice
You two never cease to amaze me! Perfect time, perfect tone, and perfect harmony.  I could tell you were both having so much fun singing that song. Simply Amazing!
This dad and this daughter are going places...😁
I dont like this, prefer old performances ;p
Great job!!!
You should make a cover on A whole new world (from aladdin).
Loved It WOW Glorious Great Trio 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🥰
I couldn't stop smiling. Wonderful!
Stunning, just stunning...all 3 of you...but Savannah...you looked like your joy would send you into orbit! Beautiful...so thankful to hear this!
Gosh, what a sensational change of pace ! I loved the happy exuberance of this arrangement. You were both so beautifully relaxed and unerringly cheerful. What a wonderful diversion you two provide against the sadness and pain of today's world. Heartfelt thanks to you for such a refreshing and uplifting treat! Warmest wishes from England. (the old one, not the New one.)
Wow! I loved this! You both are brilliant! And your piano player is unbelievable! Thank you so much for sharing your wonderful talent with us all.
Perfection! 💖😊
This was beautiful 🤩😃
When can we see you in person
Frank Sinatra song? I love it.
You just made my day! My smile while you sang this together was from ear to ear! This was a hard tune to sing and you both nailed it. Thank-you for the joy you give to all of us.❤️
Love it.
Love this❤️❤️✨
beautiful
Again, wonderful.  I love how Savannah is coming to life with her singing
I've been following you guys since the beginning and wow, just wow! Never stop doing what you're doing, it always brightens my day when you post. Much love and God Bless you both!
i really love this couple voice.. daughter and father 😍😍😍
Oh my goodness!!! You guys did a good job! Really enjoyed this video! Greetings from Germany <3
What a fun rendition of this song! I just love Mat and Savanna!
Such a stylish rendition of these two great songs.  Beautifully arranged and sung.  I wonder if you might consider songs from Les Miserables?  Matt’s voice would lend itself perfectly to Stars & Savanna could be a perfect Eponine singing On My Own.
LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS......
This video was so fun to watch! Great song and love the subtle dancing. You guys definitely look like you're having fun which is the most important thing! Cheers!
Wow!!  Love it!
Good job your awsome I know this song

Absolutely love it!!  Keep them coming!  Your duets put a huge smile on my face!
Fab!! Loving the animatedness(if that's a word)😃 Be lovely to see you do a more current song with your own slant  too❣
Amazing! Amazing! Amazing!  Please keep your fun with the Singing (I hope, my English ist right...) You both are so great :-) Thank you for every Song you share with us!
If I'm honest, I love every part of these two, but I'm a tad jealous of Dad's hair.  LOL
Her confidence is flying her to the moon!  Normally I am watching both and floating back and forth between them, but in this one SAVANNA!  Stole the show.  What a wonderful job to them both and their extremely talented  accompanist.
Gorgeous and amazing voices. And a splendid pianist. 👏👏👏👏👏👏💃💃💃💃💃
Who ever put your medley together with interspersed songs === very Andrew Lloyd Weber       style 💥💥💥 PERFECT!!!  It holds intact both adult & child. NICELY DONE!!  I appreciate hearing Mat, his voice is amazing, just as his daughter.   KEEP GOING IN THIS DIRECTION! YES! YES! YES!  PS I appreciate that efforts are being made, though clearly not publically discussed, to keep Savannah her age and not hollywood sexy childadult.  Bravo!
Request : 1. In love with you - Regine & Jacky Cheung 2. We Could be in Love - Lea Salonga & Brad Kane Thanks
I no longer need my job thanks to, *p  a  i  d t o b e h o m e .c o m*
So delightful. So nice to see them swing and more animated over these last few weeks.
Something totally different, very nice! Best regards from Germany
Very nice!  Love the live piano!
Wow! That was great! Loved the piano and I can see that Savanna is getting more comfortable on camera! Love watching and listening to you two!
Brilliant, so clever & lovely with the pianist.
B E A utiful!!!! You guys made my day do much greater!!
Wonderful update on an old song!
Amazing
When can we buy a cd composed of all these video posts.
I love both songs and the combo is great!  Your voices complement each other so well, beautiful! 😊
The three of you are so amazing! And yes fly down to Peru someday please 🇵🇪💕
Wow!! The energy in this one! So nice to see you standing up and moving around. Simply an outstanding duet. Don’t know why I would expect anything less from you two.
You are so confident now Savanna!  Love the enthusiasm.  Cheers from Australia.
Keep revisiting the old classics guys!
Two of my favorite songs ❤️
I've been waiting for another daddy/daughter duet!      You continue to impress me with your beautiful vocals!    Gives me goosebumps!     This 'mash up' was incredible!      Seemed to be more relaxed and lively.....so fun doing this one!    Thanks again for your talent!
WOW......BEST YET.... PIANA PLAYER... what a great addition❤️
just to watch you makes me smile! :D
Lovely!
If you put a thumbs down, stop watching this gloriously beautiful duo!
Wow-what a fun song! Great creative arrangement and love seeing your talented pianist!
Wow! Absolutely WOW!!! ❤️🎵❤️  This ‘mash-up’ was awesome!  So wonderful to see how Savanna has grown and developed with her musical performance - the star 💫 is shining so brightly. ❤️ Mat, your love and pride for your amazing and very talented daughter oozes from every pore. Thank you both so very much for continuing to bring joy to our lives. ❤️ Fantastic to see your wonderful musical director, Stephen Nelson, in the video too.  Xxx
Never fail to amaze me. To Savanna, it's great to see you're being a little more free and confident now. As usual, your voice is consistent Mr. Mat. And to Sir Stephen, great job!
Recently I have been having dark dreams, I started listening to you before bed and not only have they stopped, but I awaken with one of your songs running through my head.😊 What a way to start the day💞
🥰♥️🌸
You need to do more with the live pianist. And you should include his name in your intro. That was great.
Wow that’s awsome! Thank you for sharing. ❤️
I like the change up.
liked it (Come Fly With Me was a better match to voices than Fly Me to the Moon).  Think there are other songs out there that fit you all better.
That’s an amazing piano player you had as well
Absolutely phenomenal.  I loved every second of it and I will replay it many times.  Savanna you are divine and a wonderful role model for teenage girls.  Mat and Brooke  - all I can say is ..  you are a fantastic example of how loving parents can raise such a beautiful girl (and of course, your other children). I thank you for being just the way you are. Yeah Mat, I love the way you look at your daughter - you just can't beat that look of pure love.  The happiness that radiates through your videos is contagious.  We all love the Shaw family.
Another beautiful piece of music by 3 talented performers!!🎹🎼🎵🎶
Love you guys you always brighten up my day 🥰
Wow, I just left my destroyed home in Lake Charles Louisiana yesterday, this is the first thing I see on YouTube and can't say enough how much y'all have lifted my spirits!!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

I don't know if it's the song or how this was shot, but wow! Savanna looks so much more confident in this vid. Her joy was radiating through the screens! Dad's  amazing as always.

Wonderful!
Amazing!! As always!! Love your music so much! 😍
Very nice! 👏
I'll be honest:  when I heard this for the first time, I really didn't care for it.  It was such a big change from the other type of songs that you have been singing these past months.  However, I have listened to it again (and will again!) and it is growing on me -- mainly due to the beautiful blending of your voices that really characterizes your singing.  This is my first comment, so I did want to just say Amen to what so many folks have said over the months:  y'all have truly been a gift to all of us during this stressful time in our nation.  Thank you for sharing the very special gifts you have been given so generously.  And keep doing "new" stuff as you feel led, as in this current video; fuddy duddies like me can just expand our musical horizons!    Thanks to the rest of the family for sharing the two of you with all of us.  Bless you both, and stay well!  Most of all:  keep singing -- sharing hope and spreading joy!
nicely done - great to see your accompanist having fun with you as well
Fantastic! And the pianist is fantabulous as well. I guess he was the one accompanying you all this while. He’s a great accompanist.  Nice work!
Great duet....perfect harmony!
I think this is my favorite so far! Love the thematic mash-up and Savanna really cuts loose on this one  - so much fun!!! Plus an in-person pianist, too! Fabulous job! <3
Fantastic , just Beautiful !
Love this!!’
PURE PERFECTION you guys
Wonderful!
I am happy!
Loved hearing your take on these old classics and the enthusiasm displayed while singing them.  The accompanist was also great!  I look forward to hearing more of your awesome duets!
Loving this SO much! Thank you! :-D
Why on earth did they do this one?
You two might consider doing a Christmas album please??😁💫🔥💖💞
I love the variety you two share with us! Thank you!! Another wonderful performance!! Yay 🙌💖💞💫✨💖💞
Thanks for the beautiful song❤️❤️❤️
lovelovelove
Just great, helping us get through the pandemic, God has blessed your family 🙏

Marvelous!  All three of you.  What a treat!
Two of my favorite songs sung by two of my favorite singers!!! Great accompaniment! So fun😘
On of my favorite songs. Well done!
I'd seriously pay for your guys' arrangements if you guys make them. Otherwise I'd like the link :P
Savanna is a little too animated. Mat, you could fit right in back with the old crooners! You both sound great.
Wait til Postmodern Jukebox hears about this.
Just delightful!

Thank you for another lovely, lovely rendition. Great mashup and fabulous accompaniment too!
As always I loved the duet, you two are awesome.  One thing I would like to hear is Savanna singing in the lower register on a few songs.  Thanks for your inspiration.
💕 Love!
Wow! Such a fun arrangement! Great job to all!
Fabulous!!!!

This so cool!!! ... and so out of their usual choice of music ... Hope to see more of these seeing as Savanna and Mat seem to be having the time of their lives ... I wonder if the 2 of them could do The Andrew Sisters' "Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy" ... That would be something wouldn't it? Harking back to the olden days' music-filled production numbers.
not great..loved everything you did
I looooove both your voices ♥️♥️♥️♥️
Another great song! You guys just get better and better. I really love listening to you sing together. You're awesome!
It would be nice to hear a little background about your song choices. Amazing as usual and made me smile! So much talent!
I hope you are able to do some old school Christmas Music covers!!! You both have the perfect voices for it 😊
Yes!  Love seeing you both out behind the desk and able to fully express your musical joy!  Nice!
Hey so great to see Savanna light up to the challenge of live music...she really got to move everything into her singing...thanks!
Another great rendition. So great to see Stephen in real life too!!
Wow so incredible both singing voices sounds very professional should make singing a career for sure one of my most favorite songs you two have sung 🤩😌💖
😍😍😍
In other words, darling KISS me!!
That was awesome! Great job!!!
Now that was a fun one🎈🎈 Dancin'  around my living room💃
Frank is loving it.
As always spectacular!  Keep them coming!
All of your songs are wonderful, but this one is incredible! Between the fantastic new vibrato (where did you learn it?...it's perfect!), to the super arrangement, I can see you both on Broadway now!! Thank you for keeping us UP during some real down times. Love you all! 💕
You two just make me happy!!!!😍
Priceless, please sing You Belong to Me by Jo Stafford it was my mother’s favorite song she passed away in 2013 it’s such a beautiful song and I know you guys will be amazing singing it.thanks .
If I’m not mistaken, that of the pianist who plays with Gentri. He’s great also.
What a great mash up. Everyone did such a good job.
Perfect!  I was glad to see the person playing the piano... all three of you are very talented!
My favorite song so far! The live music was great!
Love, love, love!!😊👍🏻
Great piano man!!
That was so cool!  I used to have fun singing Fly Me to the Moon at,a local piano bar.  Never learned Come Fly With Me.  Love that style of music. 🎵 Always excellent!
The talent you both have is so amazing! Thank you for sharing it with the world!
Omg this was one of the best!!! You can tell you had so much fun doing it!!!
❤️+❤️
WOW!!  Why do I always feel at a total loss for words after listening to you sing??  This was amazing!  Great to see Mr. Nelson on the piano!  I'm telling you I just cannot stop smiling!  Savanna is sweet and adorable and sings beautifully.  Mat is obviously so very proud of his daughter (and a great singer).  Stephen Nelson is great!  Thank you!
Nice arrangement guys and great piano!
Beautifully done! <3
WOW, THIS WAS THE VERY BEST AND PUT SUCH A SMILE ON MY FACE WATCHING IT. ONCE AGAIN, I love you both so much. Praying we meet in person, in heaven one day. All my love and prayers. 🥰
Love watching these two , she is so much more confident

Beautiful talent!
Wow! So beautiful!
LOVE that the pianist was on video also. Wonderful 👏
WOW!!!! Amazing performance.
OMG 😍
And great to have the great pianist accompany them!
Fantastic, as usual! It’s so great to see how much Savanna has grown and matured in her performance!
So joyful and uplifting! I’d love to hear you do James Taylor’s and Carly’s rendition of Mockingbird.
Wow, just wow!
Very talented and wonderful voice's
Over halfway to a million subscribers🤗UNBELIEVABLE in such a short time! You two are some of the good that came from Covid❣
Goosebumps! When you get them from listening to both the singers and the pianist = fantabulous! Does your pianist get goosebumps while playing knowing how good it is?
Awesome tandem father & daughter . God bless your family❤️🙏
What a beautiful duet!
Nice to see that talented pianist
am in love with the pianist!
Wow, just wow. No words.
Getting to take the show on the road? Savanna shows her moves, getting ready for the stage. Hurray!
IN CONCERT...WOW..  FUTURE SELL OUT NATION WIDE...
Great arrangement, love your style
Awesome! Keep it up! Love the pianist too!
Wow! Amazing..God bless you both!..
Loved it!
what a great arrangement/mashup!
THIS IS MY FAVORITE OF YOUR SONGS SO FAR!! I'll forever be a huge fan! Watching this just inspires me, even more, to pursue a career in music, as that has always been my dream. :)
Love the arrangement and the pianist is great. Does he do all the background music for your videos? Glad you two are having so much fun while giving us such beautiful music. THANKS❤️
Soon on Broadway!!!
The Pianist be bopping
Wow! Wow! Wow! What a performance by three incredible performers! What fun it was to see not only Matt and Savannah, two brilliant singers, but also the incredibly talented Piano Man! Love it! What a combination!!
You two are really onto something.  This is delightful and playful and happy.  Savanna has blossomed since lockdown started.  She's realised the possibilities for her future, and whereas most kids who want to be in music have to try to navigate shark filled waters on their own, she has the best protection with her all the way.    It's really good to have the pianist in shot too.
Beautiful !! 😇😇😊
How fun!  Loved it!!!
Good deal! Glad to see Savanna getting into the song.  Nice to see the piano guy! More Buble'!  Maybe have Mat take more of the lead...on those songs
One of my favorite songs
We’ve loved following your journey!
Pianist is great too!
Wow, your voices are just beautiful! I can't believe anyone would dislike this.
Beautiful! :)
Broadway...
Okay! This made my day! You both are so talented and your singing is beautiful and uplifting. So nice to see your arranger at the piano, as well. Keep doing what you’re doing...bringing joy to so many!
Wow this was really great! Who is your accompanist? He did a great job too!
AweSOME!!!❤️
You guys!  There’s no limit to your talent.
HOW CAN ANYONE GIVE THESE TWO BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE A THUMBS DOWN??  THEY ARE PHENOMENAL!!!
We enjoying you both so much.. What beautiful songs.. So amazingly you guys.. God bless you family. Hugs n Love😉💌
This was truly awesome 👌 👏 watching the joy & love that flowed  While you were singing this wonderful song 🎵 ❤ 💕 💖 🎶!!!!  I love seeing the pride that just exhumes from Matt's face 😍 ❤ as he watched Savanah enjoying her singing this song 🎵 that some famous ppl have sung! I see that same pride & love that Savanah shows to you, Matt!! I applaud 👏 you 👏 both for what you bring to your viewers during so much turmoil in today's society!! This upbeat song 🎵 gets ppl bobbing their heads putting smiles on & even chiming in while you are singing but never taking their 👀 👁 eyes off of you bc you're brightening our day making it so very special!!!!!
I do enjoy your choice of songs!
Amazing
Fantastic!
It was the first thing I listened to in the morning! You made my day FLY!!!!🤗🤗

So much fun for you to make and me to watch. You two are " cool cats".
Wow ! Perfect ! ❤ from Poland 🇵🇱
I don't like jazz numbers at all but you guys are wonderful! How about David's Secret Cord/Hallelujah?
you nailed it
Fantastic! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
What a great arrangement! Never heard anything like it before although I love the song and have heard it lots of times before! It's great to see you "performing" too and to see the pianist!😄
Omgoodness that was so fun! Thanks for the joy! ❤
Wow!!!! Beautiful!!!!  Thanks for sharing your talents❣️
Goosebumps !  Very jazzy! Loved it!
Sounded great, new gear, live piano, huge improvements!
Loved it!!! So fun! Keep them coming!!!
I danced through the whole song, it's such a joy, and I love how Savannah showed so much passion and confidence like this 😀 Matt always looks proud and must be the world greatest dad ❤ Wow, Stephen is great too, I'm so glad to see the man behind the music 😀Please more of these 🙏
Savanna's voice is unreal .. would love to see her sing a duet with Lea Michelle (although she has other priorities right now) .. a nice Glee type mash-up ..
I’ve been enjoying your singing for some time now, but that’s the best yet!
Watched your other videos & there are such a blessing!  I was hoping you would get to  this place of standing up, being more expressive w/ your movements, etc.  Excellent!  Praise God!
Amazing!❤️
My most favorite ever from you two!  God bless!
You both blow me away. Such talent. Mat just beams when Savanna is singing. Such beautiful Harmony. I love the accompanist also
Fantastic love from Bali
That was great. 🥰
Two beautiful songs love you guys❤
WOW WOW WOW 🤩
As always you two are awesome
3 people in the vid, am I on the right channel, lol. Awesome! Bravo all! Great harmonizing & singing! Keep it going and Keep true love going! Blessings Peace (: Johnny
Great rendition & great Piano MAN .
So wonderful!!  Thank you for another great video!!
The best yet!!!!!
Thank you!
Such great songs, combined!! Splendid work, all 3 of you!
Is there anything they can’t sing  - brilliant.
Y'all are great, but maybe you should stand for all of your songs. Y'all  looked like you had more fun.  Overall I love y'all
Best one yet. I love how both of you are standing and the pianist is included. It seemed so natural. ❤️
I truly love y'all!!
Love that Savanna is so expressive.  Great going. Keep it up!
fantastic love the variation of fly  and harmony
Of corse I love it.  Have you thought about anything you can do I can do better or I can do without you?  Both great duets
FUN!!
Like the round version of these two songs.When is your album coming out and where can we get your CD ?
Wow.....how much they have grown! Simply, amazing!
Love this.  You both are amazing.
Wow😍😍😍😍amazing...I love following your songs...I am very empress....I noticed that you both are more happy or more blooming with this song and I saw the pianist.. yeeyyy..Good job for both of you..I like the way you look at each other 😍your smiles ..I love it..Keep up the good work..I will wait for your next song😘
I like the upbeat positive hope filled songs.  Great jobs - the joy of music for the pure joy songs in your heart!
WOW! Love the live performance with accompaniment! Amazing!!!
Hi Mat, Savanna and Stephen ! Thank you so much for this beautiful, sweet and smiling mash up !! Keep singing and smiling !! From Buenos Aires, Argentina ⚘⚘⚘💐💐💐😃😃😃❤❤❤❤❤❤👏👏👏👏👏👏
A little more upbeat than the beautiful ballads you usually sing. Absolutely loved it.❤❤❤
When is the worldwide tour?
Absolutely LOVE LOVE 💕 LOVE this one!!!!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉
Phenomenal job you two (plus pianist)!
Performing so relaxed and with such joy.   I love it !!!!    Keep on having fun entertaining us all. 🎶
Beautiful!  Thanks for including the pianist.
👍🏻 ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING! And kudos to your awesome 🎶 pianist! 🎶
Wow good job, thx for sharing
I wish more Americans can show more love and kindness like you both
I don't care who you are, you find yourself SMILING watching these two!
Stephen Nelson, the pianist..  Bravooooo🤗🤗
Love it. As always job well done.
Wow, such incredible growth and maturation in your performance.
I love you both so much! You sound so good. One thing I hope you will always do is be careful with song choice because of Savanna's age. Nothing is less appealing to me than having a song that seems inappropriate for the age of the people singing it.
This is really great!
🌹🌹
Savanna is such an old soul, indeed! Mat, I can only imagine how proud you are of her! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
That was brilliant
I have loved everything you have done but you have totally ruined this song. Sinatra would turn in his grave.
Love this  Frank Sinatra song
Oh, my...oh, my....oh, my!!! Love this! Thank you! ❤️❤️❤️
Great job. Piano, Stephen Nelson, superb!
That was awesome! Great arrangement, great harmony, superb singing and first-rate accompaniment.  Kudos to the Shaws!
Very pretty and I really enjoyed it.  God bless
This was really great love to play this song when I get my plane built for first flight 😁 God bless you all 🙏 until next time.
Wow u 2 r amazing... i am loving this!!!!
❤️❤️❤️
For a wider ranger a female voice may want to start lower. In the speaking register then there’s a reason to sing high when she needs to. Just a suggestion for a more jazzy and velvet feel. Some add filters to the microphones or use editing features.  When you only use a microphone that’s a metallic sound and effect. Some like it or don’t.
Dang! Sounded so beautiful and is such a fun song. Great job! Loved it and made me want to sing along.
What a trio ! You rocked it guy's
I love it!!!!!
Oh, superb! Wonderful mash-up. Standing, allowing some movement, the pianist, everything. Just perfect!
Just Wow guys!  You bring hope and happpiness into the world.
I’ve been hoping for some classic jazz tunes  ala Sinatra, Buble and Krall. Irresistable!  Great counter melody and harmony. BRAVO!!!
Wonderful!!!!!
Oh my gosh! That was brilliant! Absolutely love you both. Great pianist, too. Bravo!!
Amazing
Oh my this is fantastic!!
wow
Its easy to see that Matt's heart is bursting with pride & so happy that Savanna's letting go & abounding in confidence. I luv the playful lighthearted interaction between father & daughter. <3TheShawFamily.
WOW love this so entertaining x
Beautiful! What more can I say!
Beautiful. Thank you so much 👏👏👏🤗🤗🤗
I loved that rendition of old songs.  You put a smile on our faces!
Love listening to this father & daughter duet. The pianist is not bad either.
Love you both hi mat wish I could help out but wow all the members you have that’s great!
You have a cold soul if you can listen to this and not smile.
I had tears in my eyes in how beautiful it was...you both bring so much joy...please keep sharing your incredible and amazing talent...the world needs you...God bless you always
So great! Love you both!
WOW!!!! I am flying high, right now.
My question is, did Stephen Nelson dump Gentri to produce for the Shaws or is his producing for both?
Love this! Now that I think about it! I hope you don’t go to the demonic music industry! They ruin the wholesomeness and beauty of young lives.
Great performance and arrangement. Savana at least at her best. And we can see the piano player. What could we have been hoping more than that?
That was SO FUN! Great stage presence and we got to see the incredible piano guy!!!
Love this! peppy and foot tapping. :)
Love this arrangement! 👏👏👏👏👏
Great Singing as always, and the Piano... Fantastic!
You guys looked like you had more fun recording this song than any others!  So fun!
Savanna you are becoming more confident and it’s good to see you dancing as well xx God bless
Beautiful
Love this father and daughter duet, amazing voices , thank you stay well, be safe
Sinatra ... nice segue.
this is so good!!
Not my favourite  - prefer the ballads tbh
The legend behind all the magnificent piano accompaniments is finally appearing into the frame!! Such talented and authentic people singing with joy and love! So contagious happiness!! ❤️🎵👏
Bravo!!👏👏👏👏👏
Fabulous!!! There aren't enough words to say how marvelous you are. And it's a treat to see you both standing and actually performing the song, a whole new dimension. LOVE LOVE LOVE
Sounds like a great daddy daughter trip. But just for a visit.  I don’t think anyone wants to live on the moon.
Loved it.
Bravo!! Two of my favorites!! And Stephen is unbelievable!
Love this so much!!! They are so talented!!!
An unexpected treat good job guys!
WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Awesome! You both are amazing and your pianist as well!
Oh that’s just wonderful! Brilliant. Lovely family ❤️
I'm wondering if there is piano sheet music of that arrangement. Does somebody know? I'd love to play it. It is marvelous.
she’s very comfortable now in front of the camera. Matt is always so adorable.
I love it. It brought me to a whole nother place. Keep it up.
Amazing!!!
Loved loved loved it!
You guys look like you're having a blast, so fun to watch!! (And love the family photo on the wall, too.) :)
You two nailed it ! .... again! I love the jazzy change of venue.   Two thumbs up for your pianist too.
What a perfect blend of voices, one of the best mash-ups I have heard. So so professional xx
Beautiful 💕💓 as always ❤️🥰. I love that rendition. You two are so talented and blessed. You should come to Branson MO.  You'd be a hit!!!
Another beautiful song from Matt and Savannah. Love it!
This is beautifully done.   All three of you did amazing!!!!!! Thank you.
That was so wonderful...I was singing along. So happy. Thank you Shaws. God bless x
I find it better before you make it professional. Now it's to much show. Bye
Liked the vid even before it has started😀you are both amazing
I sent this to all my FB friends for a wishful Happy Sunday to put a smile on yheir face! It truly put a smile on my face! 😊😊😊  I have been a fan of you both since your first video, and will continue to listen and support your journey! Love you guys! 💕 💕  Go get'em!! 🤙👌♥️🌹‼️
Love them! Wonderful “mashup”!!!!❤️
Fantastic!! I loved this!
So great!!! Love love it
'Another outstanding performance.  This is faithful to the original, classic versions while, at the same time, managing to add a distinctly original style and flair to the sound.  Well done to all involved and thanks again for sharing. :)
Love!!  Fantastic arrangement!
I just gotta say, that was excellent!! 🌷🌹
How in the world does anyone have such a good voice?  And so young too.  Dad is no slouch either.  One more compliment--pretty dress!
You both look so happy and proud of each other your daddy and daughter relationship is so amazing❤please can you sing in the arms of an angel cant wait to hear more from you xx
Thank you 🙏!!’just wonderful 💜💜💜
This was awesome!!! I loved it.
Incredibly  blessed 🙌
Amazing I sang right along with you and after had the biggest smile on my face! Well done!
Fly me to the moon was my wedding song in February, on our first valentine's together my now husband had this playing with candles lit and we slow danced to it after i came back from work.
Brilliant. pianist is fantastic too 👌
You know, I can also see you slipping into jazz occasionally!
My goodness - that must have been difficult to put together!  Brilliantly done, though - absolutely wonderful singing and the pianist was amazing.
This was wonderful. S break away from what you've done in the past, but oh so good!  I couldn't have enjoyed it more. Thank you!
Magic!
Fantabulous!!!  I love both those songs and melding them together was genius. I get such joy listening to you. 😊
Just loved this! You really enjoyed yourselves!
The music of the film "Dirty Dancing" -The time of my life  will be amazing if you sing.
❤️
Very much hope we'll hear more songs from the The Great American Song Book.  Classics from the 50's, 40's, 30's would suit you.  This was a great rendering of Fly Me to The Moon.  Please??
What a wonderful song and duet! So much love and your singing is effortless...where have you been before 2020?🤗
Great upbeat song by my favorite daughter/Dad duo!!
These two are very very talented, you can see the chemistry between these two and the joy they have at providing to us wonderful music. The songs they prior sung where amazing. However, this song is wrong choice, not because of ability to sing it, but because of the meaning of the lyrics. There is only one person we worship and that is God.
Tolles Duett!Eure Stimmen passen gut zusammen .Ihr seid sehr sympathisch! Ich mag Euch!Dazu merkt man Eure VaterTochter Beziehung!Und das find ich toll!Weiter so!!!😀👍🌻🌹
Love the dad's voice..💙
Adorei ver vocês dançando com a música. Estão mais soltos, sentindo mais a música. Isso é excelente! 👏👏👏
Excellent!

You two just keep getting better and better which I never thought possible!! You don’t realise just how special you really are!! Your voices compliment each other, and Savanna your voice has such purity to it. Matt, without offence to Savannah I’d love to hear more solo songs sung by you if possible..your voice has a lovely tone and timbre to it...I feel you really enjoying yourself singing with your beautiful daughter, and making up for lost years possibly... We all enjoy seeing the proud looks of support and pleasure you give Savannah during your singing, and you beam like the Cheshire Cat..your so thrilled to see her grow and gain such confidence, so she can sing simply anything perfectly now! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻😘😘💐💐🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋 bravo!

American Idol? The Voice? 🤔😃
You probably work hard and practice a lot, but you make it look effortless :).   Thanks for every song. Always ready for the next one. 💕
Chills 🥰 thank you!
So fun to see you perform "live" with your great pianist friend, Stephen Nelson. Great mashup, and I love to see no one can stay still (me neither) during this mashup!
Love to see that movement, animation and confidence growing in this dynamic duo!!  You two are amazing and we THANK YOU for giving us joy during this pandemic.  Thank you for sharing your gift and your father/daughter fun with us.  I wish you great and growing success.
Wow!  This is so special!  Love the accompanist addition, the harmony, Savannah has grown vocally so much and Mat, you're doing a great job too!  Love it.
Very old songs  Still nice to hear those lovely songs. Thank you for singing daughter and father really got talent to duet.
They never cease to amaze me !! Well done guys 👏
That was fun. Good job.
Wow!   Sweet and beautiful!!!
Love love you both. Enjoy so much hearing you both sing. Now we have a little bit more movement. Great.  Amazing
AMAZING!

Woo-hoo what a great job. Thank you
Can't say more than BEAUTIFUL
Very difficult song to sing.
What a beautiful musical arrangement. Perfect duet as usual.
Sweet!!!  Great showing their diversity!!!❤❤❤❤
Every time I listen I think "ah that's the best one yet" and then you improve yet again.  Well done on yet another fantastic duo filled with love and shared with the world.  Looking forward to the next.
Reminds me of Frank and Nancy Sinatra 😊💞
You just get better and better.  Listening to the two of you gives me such joy and I, like so many others, sure need that right now.  Thank you.
This was a perfect blending of two songs and you nailed it. Just love it when you come out with a new song.
Great job
WOW WOW WOW!!!!! Another Amazing song!  You put a smile on my face.  Thank you Savanna, Matt and Stephen for the beautiful music!  You guys bless me on this Sunday!
Nice to see them dancing while singing instead of sitting still.
Ooooo more Jazz, yes please. This sounds so great.
I can finally enjoy life thanks to, *p  a  i  d t o b e h o m e .c o m*
I love this daughter and dad! What a bright spot in this time.
Beautiful, as always!!!  Great piano accompaniment, too!!!  Thank you ... all three!!!

Beautiful!  Nice that we get to see your accompanist too!  Thank you for the music!!!
wow that was amazing excellent job shaw family
That girl will be a Broadway star.
A fan from the Philippines :) I always look forward to your videos. May I make a request? Can you try singing Falling Slowly? Would really love to hear you sing it. Thanks!
Can't wait for Christmas songs in a few months!
Wow <3 great voices
EXCELLENT YOU TOO!  ❤☺👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Darling hold me.... Not kiss me 😘. What a family.
Savanna beautiful as always.  Mat your voice is just absolutely wonderful .. I love the timbre of your voice ... beautiful vibrato!  Do more songs like this.  You two are amazing!
Applaus...
Loved this with the live piano playing!
Beautiful
Wow that was fantastic,,, thanks for singing to us :-)
Is it true?? Is there a CD coming out??L Where and when???? I can’t wait!
Something different for you guys and I just love it. Fresh and clean!!! Love it!!
Love all your songs but a mashup was a nice change.  Great to see the pianist as well.
The whole day I had an earworm of „fly me to the moon“ and now you upload this as a mashup it’s crazy but I love it ❤️❤️
Please sing Miss Saigon duets:)
Wow you both are amazing and continue to impressed with how much you love what you do and share together!!!
A cheerful song lights up our dull isolated life.
WOW!
Awesome!  Love it. Savanna love to see your personality come out while you sang. I grew up listening to frank Sinatra, bobby Darren, etc. my dad always had music playing. Brought back great memories. Thank you so much❤️
It was so different from your other videos, but I absolutely loved it just as much as all your other videos!
Beautiful guys.  God Bless.
Such fun! Love this.
Wonderful!!
as always very excellently presented, thank you. also to the great pianists.
Best one yet!!!
Brilliant as always! Shout out to the guy on the piano - so talented!
PARABÉNS AO PIANISTA UM TALENTO ESPECIAL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PARABÉNS A VOCÊS .......LINDOS....DIFERENTE.....O BRASIL AGRADECE POR ESSA APRESENTAÇÃO MÁGICA.
I am such a fan of all of your music but this one was extra amazing! You two have a very special gift  and I’m so blessed everytime I hear you!  I can’t wait to see how the Lord keeps using  your voices for Him! ❤️
Great job guys😁
Joyous! Thank you Mat, Savannah & Stephen 🎹. That was magical. You make a fellow musician smile a lot watching this X
Very nice!
OMGOODNESS! That was awesome! Thank you!
Two words   Just fantastic
I love that you are exploring jazz. Just wondering, Savannah, have you thought of trying and Alison Krauss song? I bet you would just soar there too and it would be very different from your current is genre if you are looking for more variety over time. One of her big hits was, "When you say nothing at all." I could see you putting a Savannah spin on that and making it your own. It's really precious and Lovely song. Just like you!  - Summer Beach
Fantastic!!!!! Frank Sinatra?? Ginger Rogers?💕💕💕💕
Fabulous you Guys 💗💙
Love all your videos, but enjoyed this so much more than having you just sitting in front of the camera.  So much personality, not to mention talent, between you.  Love the way dad looks at daughter.  So much pride.  Wish I still had my dad.
Brilliant as always loved it 👍🎤x
Love it ,Dad you both can change at times one on the left or right,or sit in the other seat.i do enjoy both of you singing. You all are a God send.
Wanda Orton Wow!  This is so much fun.  And love your pianist!  Just Great!!!
:D :D :D awwwwwww wonderful... HalleluYah and Blessings ♥♥
Wonderful!  Their voices blend so perfectly.
I can't believe Matt never made it to Broadway when he was young! Well it's never too late for both of them! Have they gotten a good manager yet? They just blow me away they're that good!
I just have pictures of 2 wee caterpillars 🐛 who entered into their cocoons and emerging as the most beautiful butterflies 🦋with their sets of wings all ready to fly to the moon 🌕 you are both well on your exciting journey ❤️
Is it just me or is anyone else wishing for a Christmas Album from these two 🥰😳
As always,  fantastic duet! Was curious,  is anyone else in the family as musically talented? I.E. Does the Mom sing so gloriously?
Absolutely beautiful and fun!!  Please keep singing!!
So fun!  My daughter says, "that's my favorite"  Thanks for bringing old greats back to life!
I loved this song so much! Great job! I could listen to both of you all day. The pianist was great as well. Thanks for sharing.
Mat owns this song.
I have never before heard such an amazing version of ‘come fly with me’!  You two are unbelievably talented xx
Definitely a somewhat different style, but so well done and entertaining!!!  Oh, Dad, your little girl is growing up- you are obviously extremely proud of her in all that she does!❤
All I can say is "WOW"! I think this is my favorite style for you guys. Really showcases your harmonies!
Perfection 👌👌
Just Amazing!!!!
Just discovered your channel. Fly Me To The Moon is one of my favorite songs. Thank you so much for the mini concert. Take care, Debi.
Mat and Savanna, absolutely amazing!!! Steven Nelson... you rocked it on that piano. Great job!
Fabulous. Thank you.
You two are so talented, you have brightened many hearts! Thank you
This is my favorite one you have done. I love old classics. ❤️
I love you to . Vous avez un excellent pianiste en plus , Une équipe de rêve.  Merci
The Joy and the love in both of their faces during singing this is amazing and makes my mood mich better.
Beautiful!!!
I am in love with this mash up!! Savannah sounds heavenly! Her dad sounds like he belonged in the rat pack lol.
Father and daughter. Wonderful!!!
Fantastic!  Did not know you could be even better but you did it!  Simply the best!  Thank you!
Can I say Broadway
Absolute perfection!!!
Excellent as always! The live pianist is a nice touch. I have enjoyed all of your videos, especially The Prayer. Someone must have suggested that you go on AGT. I think you would win. Watching Savanna is like imagining a young Katharine McPhee. You have a bright future in musical theater, should you choose to go that way. And Dad's no slouch, either!
Loved the mashup!  Y'all did great!  😃
Stephen Nelson on the piano is AMAZING!!!!
Nice job!  Who's the piano player?
Now on to Broadway  and live tours etc then more and more albums ❤
Holy mackerel!!!!!!!  That was phenomenal!!!!   Such an incredibly creative and beautiful rendition of  Sinatra’s two classic songs!!!  The crystal clear tone, your range and the blending of harmonies  knock my socks off every time!!!!!  Congratulations on an incredibly beautiful job done!!!! ❤️🤗👏🙇🏻‍♀️💯❤️
Your new are the reason is the best I have ever heard and before listened to yours never knew existed
That was fantastic!!!
That was worth waiting for.  Love from Australia
Beautiful!
The sound flows like the cream to the top of a gallon of fresh milk. Love it.
Kept hoping you both would stand up and sing eventually rather than just sitting.  It looks more relaxed that way.
toooo cute & wonderful as always!!!!
Wow! That was an absolute pure joy ride! What a gift. Thank you!
I love your story, I really do. Both of you are wonderful people. I love the songs and arrangements. I do think that Savannah needs to study with a jazz teacher if she is serious about this type of music. You have a very distinct style of singing which is great for ingenue roles in theater, etc. Get some training with a jazz or blues specialist. You are still young and have the opportunity to develop jazz chops. ( This is all meant kindly)
Wow, wow & wow!!!!!! Amazing. Oh my gosh, you made my day. Absolutely, breathtakingly beautiful.
So happy to see the accompanist!   Kudos to all for sharing uplifting art, look forward to so much more!
Just wonderful - Such a lovely time you have given me during lockdown.  Libby - England.
superb !!! great fun !!! xxxx
You brought tears to my eyes and joy to my heart.  Thank you. Hey piano guy great job
OMG You guys just keep getting better and better!  Fantastic job.  Also enjoyed seeing your "music man" in this vid.
Brilliant as usual!!
That was awesome! Great vocals and great piano playing! 😀
Amazingly fun and upbeat songs that very naturally suit your personalities to a T. Great joy!! ❤
As always love you all and love the pianist! Thank you for your music!
Love these guys and this rendition of these great classic songs! Awesome job! Can't get enough of these two!
You bring me so much joy.  Bless you.
This was great 🎤🎹🎤! It would be amazing if you would sing The Last Night of the World from Miss Saigon
Great song showing Savannah and Matt' versatility. I like the addition of the piano player. Please continue these amazing songs that lift my spirits during these difficult times. Thank you so much.
OMG... I couldn't love these 2 any more. So, so good.
I loved this! I guessed it right!!! You did a great job. I can't wait to hear what's next.
Bravo, bravo, bravo to all three of you !!! 🇨🇦
Just splendid!!!!!!   Love you all!  God love blessings and abundance.  Also recognize pianist 😃
These videos make me happy!
I love you guys so much.
you guys should do a Christmas album
Enjoy the two of you so much!  Piano player too!
You can tell they are definitely getting more comfortable in front of the 📷
Awesome job, y'all! One of my favorites! 💕 It would be great to see you two interact with each other more. 🙂
Great job! I'm glad to see the pianist also. He does a wonderful job.
I know we all always see it and comment but the pure love & pride on Mat’s face while he watches and sings with Savanna is just gold.  Their family is beautiful in more ways than one.  Thank you for sharing your joy and music.  And thanks for adding your accompaniment on the keys behind you in this one.  Brava!  Blessed Sunday all.
:) Very good. Thank you both. God Bless you all in Love.
Nice mashup ... Mat , your harmony is great!
Excellent!!! Love it!!!
Talk about range!! Incredible talent! Incredible family! Extra incredible pianist! 😉
Who was the pianist? He was great!
Sounds great!
Delightful !

✨✨✨✨✨✨
I absolutely loved this!!!! What a great job you did. 👏👏👏

Bravo!Здорово!
Omg I love the father voice you guys sounds great
My favorite one so far
I love how dad always showcase his daughter~ just a beautiful family dynamics.  So nice to see in this day of age❤️. Everything feels so genuine.
Music is Beautiful but do it as a family is powerful. Wish one day our Channel can be seen as yours. ❤️
This is so cute- she’s really getting into the song and you can see the joy her dad has, just watching her as he sings along. And the first time she sings I love you, she looks directly at her dad ♥️
Got better and better as the song developed. New style with piano. Agree, get a bus and tour the country.
One of your best, yet. Terrific arrangement.
Got better and better as the song developed. New style with piano. Agree, get a bus and tour the country.
Bravo!! Great cover of Old Blue Eyes!!
I am in heaven just listening to your glorious voices, you are so incredibly talented.
Loved have your very talented pianist included with you guys!  You guys are just awesome, I can’t find words.  I have to say I prefer slower, less jazzy music. But it was fun to see how talented you two are to mix it up!
I love every song they sing.   Such talent!  God bless you both.  You have brought joy in many homes, iincludiing mine!
Beautiful singing beautiful arrangement beautiful piano playing thanks so much for sharing , ❤️❤️❤️🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏

Great singing and I love that your putting your arm movements in too
That was just great!  Fun!!
Great arrangement and accompaniment for these lovable and amazing singers!
Thank you so much for blessing our lives with your gifts!
Wow!!  Awesome!
I always admired how well close relatives voices blend.  These two are no exception!  I hope someday that you cover a song I hate.  I won't hate it after that!
Wow! Just wos! Love you guys❤️
I love this! So beautiful and uplifting!
She should try out for American Idol
BRAVO well done from West Cork, Love your little dance Savanna  you'll have to get Dad moving to the Groove  too  Matt great  as always

What an awesome choice of songs! Love it...
Great mashup and piano playing. I wasn't sure to begin with as it is a change of style, but second time round I liked it. Good to see you letting your hair down and going for it 👍😁
One of my top favorites for sure!!!!  Just an awesome rendition!
Gefällt mir sehr gut. Wunderbare Stimmen. Gruss aus der Schweiz. Von Doris.
Really lovely! Your songs always lift my mood and make me happy. ☺️
I can't wait for Christmas albums! God bless you Shaw family!
I initially clicked on this 10 minutes ago and have already listened to it 3 times. A new favourite, for sure. Superb!
They are amazing.  I can't what to see what they sing next.
Hang on...I need to put my socks back on.  Absolutely stunning, as usual.  Highest marks.
Love this!  So creative and inspiring!  The sound quality was a little distorted.  Not sure why.
Oh my gosh!!!! I smiled during the entire video!!!! I love those songs and you both took them to a whole new level. LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE YOU GUYS!!! Fabulous!!
Wow, what a fun song! Let's fly away!
Wow! Yes! There are people that sing and play piano technically correct, there are people that sing and play piano with emotion...but when you marry the technique with emotion...haha, walla...this is what you get! You are all amazing! How neat to see our piano man , the man behind the music. Thank you all so much for continuing to provide us with such uplifting music and it's great to see how much fun and love you have for the process! This video has brought my heart so much joy today! Ty, ty, ty! ❤🙏👏

Thank you ❣
Wow, incredible as always and a high-five to Stephen Nelson on the piano.  Amazing job everyone!  One question... is this the first we've heard from Stephen or has he done all the piano arragements?
I ❤️ The Shaw Family😘
Truly uplifting in this depressing world!  Thanks guys!  I feel better now.. 😉

GREAT JOB!!!!
Hi this is so wow love it fantastic Matt and Savannah big hugs Yvonne💋💋🎤🎤🎶🎶😀😀
That was wonderful, definitely one of my favorites. I was dancing in my chair the whole time. I also loved the pianist and liked how you showed him in the video. I thought it added a more fun component especially since you could see his enjoyment. Nicely done, thank you! I always look forward to you both and whenever I see you have a new video I drop what ever I am doing and make you both my priority. I will be smiling all day now and will probably watch the video a few more times today. Thanks again and please tell the pianist thanks from me as well
That was absolutely fabulous!!
Wow!  Gorgeous!!  And that pianist!
How fun!!! What another great duet. God bless you two! Keep them coming. Still waiting for "Somewhere" from the west side story.
I get chills when I hesr them sing!💖
THAT WAS AWESOME!  THANKS!
🎵 Fun to watch and listen. Great voices, great body language, great pianist in the background. 🎶
Chills and joy goes through my body as I listen to the both of you. Thank you sooooooooooo much. I love you both!  ❤️💖
Thank you so much for this wonderful medley...! I knew since the first song you both were talented but this was a masterpiece...!!! It is so difficult to sing different texts and melodies so near together... and not to switch to the other one... and not recorded in advance... you seem to be ready to perform live on stage with your wonderful "pianoman" !!! You are far to good to go to AGT ... you are already stars... I hope more people will soon recognize this... best wishes and lots of love to the whole family... Barbara from Germany
Amazing! I look forward to every video! I love your voices!
Love having the pianist there for this one and the fluidity of the location!
Please make a cd soon!
Love you! I think I have to join the Shaw family. I always get so happy and have tears in my eyes when listening to you. It is just so beautiful and joyous. You two and everyone in your family are so humble and nice, you are the best!! Much love from Sweden.
Great new arrangement! Absolutely anxious for your new postings every week! You two are amazing! Does your family play musical instruments as well?
This is so enjoyable to watch! The harmonies are so tight and clear from these beautiful voices. Good work on the piano too. You just can't beat a live performance!
What a lovely way to start the day!
Felicitaciones !!!!  Desde Asunción, Paraguay. América del Sur.  Maravillosos !!!
Nice to see you’ve come out from behind the desk!!! Great rendition!!! Well done!!! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼✨
I love you both are sound great love listening to you both
ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC.  You have an amazing future in the music industry!!
One day, she will be very famous!!
Wow!
Pure joy! The interweaving of harmonies between Mat and Savanna is stunning, and I am mightily impressed with Savanna's musicianship (at such a young age!) in nailing those intricate harmonic transitions with such beauty and craft And all honor to the virtuoso pianist "comping" in the background.  A modern-day Bill Evans! More!
So much to love here! The arrangement, you are standing and to see your pianist ... he’s real! Of course always present the love of a Dad when he looks at his daughter, and the presence of God and his gifts appreciated.
Yet another beautiful song and music! Love your voice 😊
Loving the pianist! Beautiful!!
Beautiful
YAAAS!  Just as I was thinking of running away but wondering where on Earth I could go...! Thank you! 💞🌛
Just perfect!!!
Such a fun mashup. It was so enjoyable to watch and listen.  Well done.  Dave
I love your voices together but sorry to say this is my least favorite of your videos. I just don’t like this version of either song or mashups in general.
Your voices concert together like no duet I’ve ever heard!  And to think it all started just a few months ago!  The best thing that has happened to YouTube  since then. Your voices and God given talent are amazing.  Thanks for being yielded vessels!
I loved the up beat jazzy!  You two are fabulous together!
Wow!!  That was fabulous!!!
Loved it! Frank Sinatra tunes are my favotite! Thank you!
Wow!  Beautiful!  And the piano guy was fantastic too!
Such a beautiful family ❤️. Your amazing voices coupled with the love you share brings a smile to my face each & every time. Thank you for lifting us up 🥰
Beautiful!
You both are Amaziiiinggggg Love youuuuu
Great duet !  Here’s to the next one ! Brilliant 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧👏🏻👏🏻
I love Savanna's voice!
As usual...perfection
What a great trio!❤️. A room filled with talent! Thanks guys!✈️
Is there anything these two can't sing?  Nope!
Love the big band theme! Try some more! Yay! 👍🏻💗 Shout out to the marvelous pianist ⭐️
I had 5 notifications for subscribed channels and of course I opened up yours first. It was wonderful to hear another great duet from you two. Thanks for making my day!
Simply sublime, just found your channel and I am addicted. One proud dad, can see it as he sings.
Even though I enjoy your voices separately, the “majic happens” when singing together! Take the time to make your decisions wise In all things🙏🏻🙏🏻
Thank You Thank You Thank You...truly

Always love it when you 2 sing. Makes my dreary day much better. Savana and you have such beautiful voices and I can see how much she loves to sing with her Dad. You could both go far if you decided to do this as a profession. I would love to purchase your CD's. Keep it up. Love you too the moon and back
Wow live music! You guys are growing leaps and bound! Absolutely beautiful!
Wonderful! Is this the pianist who's been accompanying you all along? He's amazing! And no music!! Thanks for making us smile!!
Awesome!!! Please do 99 years by Josh Groban and Jennifer Nettles. You would kill it!!!!!
And great piano playing.
The two of you sound amazing as always. The pianist sounds great also!!
Love the old ballad's and it was nice to hear an upscale version!!!
So good!  That really uplifted me this morning.  God has blessed you to bless others.
Would you consider singing unforgettable by dad and daughter cole?
What amazing voices use have well done and stay safe xxxxx 😘😘😘❤️❤️❤️
There is a TV show here Netflix, Amazon,,Hulu.  The new Partridge Family; wholesome, attractive, talented.  Can’t miss!
We all noticed and loved the way Mat would loving look at Savanna when this incredible father/daughter duet first graced us with their talent. I hope that will remain a natural response and not become too contrived. I hope that makes sense. I love you guys!!!!!
You two are becoming really professional! Huge progression from your first video!!
Soooooo Fun...such BEAUTIFUL voices!!!!💗💗💗💗👍👍
Oh...you guys...that was so fun.  Savanna...you are blossoming right before our eyes.  The "Moon" is where you are headed.  Great job...loved it!
Credit your pianist! He's great.
Wow that was amazing you all.
It sounds better with the music back up instead just saying!! You're still fabulous with singing. Not to be negative just observing. You are great no matter what you sing!!
Perfect! You makes me so happy. Father and daughte so awesome!
I think Frank would have enjoyed that.
Wow!
Wow amazing. Absolutely love it.

I just wanted to tell you that I've been feeling so encouraged listening to you guys' songs. You two are truly gifted and talented, and ofc using the talent for those who really need.  I am a medical student applying for residency this year. It has been such a bad year for all of us but I hope I could be of help to someone who really needs it just like you guys :)  God bless you!
You two are better than Frank ever was.! Thx
Brillant job again guys loved it
Now that was lighthearted and fun. Thanks for brightening our day. Kudos to the pianist.
Sung very nicely, but in my opinion this type of music is not as suitable for you as what you have sung so far. The pianist played very well! Greetings from Upper Austria, Willi
Listening to this again it's the best xx
An up beat number, I'm sure that's a first and what a novel arrangement. I always enjoy your singing and this medley shows you have versatility too.  I particularly enjoyed the descant. Well done you two.
Spectacular 🥳 - ShawFam member
Fantastic mashup! Fun!! 💙
What a great arrangement! It must have been so much more fun singing to a live instrument...
Another great song together xxx
Savanna your voice is incredible woman you have come come on keep it up
O M G . PERFECT. THANK YOU
Oh nice, the pianist is getting some fame. I love this song and you three just upped its ranking 💥

You both smashed it :)
Much more movement, different just sitting there.  👍

That was a thoroughly enjoyable combination of those 2 songs. And I really liked the pianist - a great addition. This performance waa beautiful. I loved it. Thanks! I'll be playing this over a few more times, tonight. Well done! 😎🇦🇺👍

Music is something I think every human being can relate to in some way.  Thank you for giving us beauty to listen to during this trying time and calming  our inner spirits.  There is always beauty to be hand in even the most difficult of times! Blessings to you..............please continue to share .............it's such a gift to listen to you!

Wow this lockdown has not been getting you two down as it.  Lovely voice and song once again. Nice family photo in the background x.
Great song you two!  It was so fun to see your piano man too!
To mix these two songs is a wonderful idea. I love them both and I absolutely love you guys standing and moving to the music (hallelujah a real pianist!!!!). I already see you dressed up and performing on a big Stage. I hope it won't take too long to make this happen! This crisis has produced so much sorrow but among all the negative effects it has brought out of the sea of unknown talent, the two of you. You cheered us up, helped us to go on and right now this new video gives us hope that slowly but surely the world will get back to normal again. Hopefully an even better normality! Thank you so much ❤️❤️❤️ All the best from your Austrian Fan!

Beautiful.  Love the piano player with no sheet music!! What a blessing to be able to hear this.
Bravo!!!
You two get better and better...love it!! Love the piano too... perfect!!!!
Sounds great but still not a live recording in my opinion. Audio sounds pre-recorded, doesn’t match the room you are in. Still great though.
Gorgeous x love both these songs

Love this!
Wonderful as always - piano a little overbearing at times - old mic was better. BUT, KEEP IT UP!!!

Mat and Savanna that was just amazing. You could see the fun that you had when singing that song. You both have got better and better since  you first sang The Prayer. There is so much confidence listening and looking at you both. Loved the person playing the piano. X

Oy.
thank you for the beautiful song, I liked it very much. I am always fascinated by such great ones. many thanks. I wish you a nice Sunday evening. L.G. A.K.
So good to hear another song from both of you. Just think this all started by posting a song on Utube and it went to the moon and back. Now you are making albums recording songs before long you will be touring all over the world. Selling out your shows. Buying a bus that's big enough for your whole family and another one for your band. So happy how far you have gone. God bless you and your family. Stay safe during the pandemic. 😁❤🎼🎵🎶🎧🎤
The vocals are so much better when you are both standing, well done ! 🌍🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🌍
Absolutely love 💘 this production.  Keep up the great work! Savanna your growth and  confidence is a blessing to watch! And Mat the love and pride of a Father is always a good thing for others to see. And what this world needs! Both parents are key to the success of our children. Modeling what is good! Keep up the good work! Can't wait for what is next.
