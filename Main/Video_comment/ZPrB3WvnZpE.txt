An under recognized achievement. This company will ultimately be a success. Branson wouldn’t let this fail.

So you guys acctually fly up to space and fly back in the end? That is awesome! You built a fully functional low orbit spacecraft! ❤ much better than bezos and elons.  How is it going??
Congratulations !!! Great pics.

How do the pilots have supplied air but the passengers don’t? Same with bezos.

Going high and falling for a few minutes is not “going to space”. Technically, if you jump into a pool, on a trampoline, anything that causes you to free fall, you are doing what they did.  If you use lens distortion, you can also achieve a curved horizon just like they did. However, even at 50 miles above sea level, the horizon is flat, just like at sea level, because there is no curve, and never will be.  No matter how high someone goes, it’ll never be “high enough” to see curvature. Someday we’ll get to where the space station supposedly is, and by then, that’ll not be “high enough.” Are you getting it yet?
Why dont the passengers have to wear oxygen like the pilots
What is the knocking sound outside the spaceship ? Is it the same thing a Chinese astronaut experienced?
Not the richest but the most relatable billionaire.
what happened to the feathering rotation of wings that killed the previous pilot
Oh my lord. My son would absolutely love love love to do this. Unfortunately he has a prognosis of a very young age do to having Duchene muscular dystrophy & if I could make this happen for him at some point in his life I'd say that would be the ultimate dream accomplished for him. I saw this and wanted to cry. This is an amazing thing! A dream not otherwise accomplished as being an astronaut will be far fetched for him. He's only 9 right now.
Pilots experience it for free multiple times.
Just signed up for a future trip. Hope to get my date soon for my 35th birthday in 2 years! Wish me luck 🥺

1:25 what's to keep some giddy passenger from accidentally going over the safety net and impacting the controls? I'd prefer NOT to see another disaster like Spaceship Two.
You can do the same thing in a MIG JET
so why all space agencies don't use this method of flying first to high altitude and than launch where less air resistance and distance to even more less air resistance exists...again?
If I ever win the lottery....idc how stupidly expensive it is....any amount of money is worth seeing our precious planet and universe like this

gofundme flat earthers lmao
I love the idea that we’re so close to having space tourism.  Or at least the thought of it.  But your execution needs a lot of work.  I find it incredibly hard to believe that a company like Virgin Galactic would send tourists up to the edge of space without having them wearing proper attire.  Coveralls most definitely aren’t proper attire.  These people should have all been fitted for and dressed out in pressure suits and attached helmets.  And your passenger compartments should all be equipped with connectors to provide fresh air, suit cooling, and communications for the entire trip.  I’ve heard the excuse “It’s just a short flight and it’s over.”  But that short flight covers the time periods where something is more prone to failure than while up in orbit.  If just one of your tourist flights depressurizes, the entire crew will return dead.  It doesn’t matter how much emergency oxygen is available to them when up at the edge of space, because their bodies won’t be able to use any of it.  That’s because their blood will have turned into a deadly cocktail of boiling froth from which there’s no medical treatment to reverse the effects and damage caused as a result.  You simply can’t survive having your blood boil within your body.  It’s an instant death sentence for the entire crew.  When a commercial airline depressurizes, you loose much of the oxygen you need to breathe, but the atmosphere pressure is still high enough to prevent your blood from boiling.  In your spacecraft, not only will you loose the oxygen, but you’ll loose all the atmospheric pressure as well.  And no amount of spare oxygen is going to restore the vital pressure needed to keep blood from boiling.    Your flights, as laid out, are simply too dangerous.  They remind me of a certain owner trying to sell tickets on his submersible by telling people that it’s safer than walking across the street.  Well, going up to the edge of space is NOT safe.  And as a company, you’ve failed to mitigate the risk involved.  Obviously you can’t eliminate all the risk.  But this is one that you can.  And the cost of keeping multiple sizes of pressure suits readily available for your passengers is well worth the added expense.  So what if they’re not as comfortable as they could be.  They’re alive.  That’s far more important.  Besides that, why would anyone want to go up and see what it’s like to be an Astronaut without having the opportunity to dress the part as well.  Real Astronauts don’t fly into space unless they’re wearing their spacesuits, helmets attached, visor down, suit comfortably pressurized, inner cooling suit’s water turned on and circulating, communications established.  That’s the real experience of being an Astronaut….even if just for a short flight.  Not only would your passengers get a much better overall experience, but in the advent of an unexpected cabin failure, they’re all still return back down alive.   And space tourism will continue.  But the first flight that returns with a dead crew will also be the last flight the government allows for unqualified tourists.
Congratulations to Virgin galactic for all they've accomplished 🎉🎉🎉🎉 I hope my daughter turns out to be as successful as them. After all, my daughter's father is an engineer who works for virgin galactic... But he never came back to me after telling him I was pregnant with his child. And I never filed for child support. Still, I wish nothing but success for ALL🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Look !  Earth is really plate....😂

So the earth is not flat 🙂😂
But why was he trying to open that window!!@2:18
why others believe that the earth is flat, it has a curviture 🤔
You can see the water bubbles
Fake
Seems to me the 'windows' were actually movie screens, and they were just free falling in the sky the whole time. They had to sign an NDA to agree they would not say the Earth is flat when they came back down.
Sounds like there in a tin can
Congratulations 🎉 on making your dream come true
Lol they immediately just start playing volleyball with the one girl!😂
Pause the video at 1:43. Anyone see problem?🤣  🐟👁️
Why cool ✨✨🌎
Comedy gold ...lol  Today the first  " space tourists" Will be allegedly going to space ...just watched the BBC news segment on it , They're gonna experience  ""5 MINUTES OF ZERO GRAVITY "" SO ,they're just going for a 9,000 dollar parabolic flight ...lmfao... It's costing them  over 100 grand each ...they're  being told they're gonna be in space 😂😅 MUGS  What a con. Nothing and nobody has ever been in space... these clowns will also be viewing earth's   " curvature " Through the VERY CURVED WINDOWS  on the virgin galactic plane ...lol Fish eye lens effect incoming ...😂 Dumb  people amaze me ...
yeah I would rather take this trip than go under water 💦 😮😆😯🤔 lol how long was this flight
I love that guy. I saw a film on HBO about Richard and was blown away by what an incredible person he is. Beyond this the guy has his own Giant Turtoises. If that doesn’t tell you how incredible he is and what a wild life he leads I don’t know what does. I am going to school for Computer Science at the age of 40 and presently I am on disability and watching that movie on Richard durring a time when I was ready to quit school was inspiring and beautiful people like this guy remind us that this is the land of opputunity and incredible success is ours to have if we work hard at it and have a positive attitude. Cheers Richard🎉
Wow!😍🧑‍🚀🚀
So much better than Bezos. This type of space tourism is cheaper and burns less fuel too. Tourists have no business reaching orbit. There's no point.
And flat earthers still go on 😂
The titan sub wasn’t enough of a warning apparently 😂

Sir Richard Branson really is something else. Not falling short of Amazing!
thank you for showing us that the earth is flat
To all flat earthers, if you look in 2:22  you can see the curvature of earth  so the earth is round not flat
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤦🤦🤦
genial
Anyone else looking for flat earthers in the comments?
They realized that we don't have a sun because from earth we look at it and they are in space they don't see it.🤔😮
Your spaceship never reached space 😀
Wow that was amazing . When it separated and boosted then just floated . Was awesome congrats

FAAAAAKE
Earth so flat?
Will this spacecraft need to replace heat shields just as the space shuttle did ? Also do these space craft experience the EXTREME heat and loss of communication just as space capsules and the space shuttle did upon re-entry. Last question is will this spacecraft achieve the same altitude as the space shuttle or will it just enter the edge of space ?
Lol
Flat 🗺️
Unnecessary and stupid.
Richard Branson is such an unwise man, looking down when he should have only looked above ☝️
Awesome!……….. Congratulations………. Space flight and Aviation History has been written………
🤭🤣🍿
Very fake

It will fix global warming for sure, for billionaires.
The look on RB face says it all. He knew this was sketchy as hell and it wasn’t safe but he flew anyway to try an install some faith from his already dubious backers. He knew the writing was on the wall.

Amazing experience! I didn't see them holding any camera for selfie?!

Und wieder wird berichtet und die Medien stürzen sich drauf. Wieso werden keine obdachlosen gezeigt die auf der Straße pennen. Oder 5 Mill. In Armut lebende Kinder. Rentner die Pfandflaschen aus den Müll suchen. Ich könnt so kotzen.
Wieder was was sich nur reiche leisten können,genau wie bei den Titanic Trip. Schämen sich diese Menschen überhaupt nicht? Es gibt sinnvollere Möglichkeiten in der Welt zu helfen . Egoistischen Pack. Schämt Euch.
Hey Dicky Branson sort your TV Company out they are a Fkin shambles
This is awesome
The dream would be to travel from Los Angeles to Melbourne using this mode of travel. Commercial space travel is just beginning. In the future, we may see more virgin galactic planes showing up at airports. Mark my words, in 5-10 years, SPCE will be at least a $100b company
Looks flat to me
That honestly would be to life changing and I would love to be able to experience it well done for changing the world as we know it
The flat earthers want to know is the world a globe 😂
Is there wifi to check your phone in there ?
Just imagine what YOU could do! Just make sure you have $450,000 to spare for a seat 😂
❤❤❤❤
2:12 y los terraplanistas donde estan? cuando van a lanzar una expedicion para probar que esto es una simulacion?
Five minutes and I'll be screaming I want to go home! I can't breathe!!!!
1:13 fish eye lens. They went high and free fall exists without air pressure but space as we are told does not exist and the earth is demonstrably level.
This is my dream, all my life ive wanted to see the world from above from Space. Sadly, i could never afford something like this so will likely die before this is ever a reality for me. Id give anything.
fantastic. congrats to the  virgin galctic
How do people still think the earth is flat???
They didn’t even reach the edge of space 14km short 😂
How long are they unstrapped?
Muita mentira, dá para ver gostas caindo desse avião no tempo 2:10 até 2:14 no momento que eles estão flutuando. Como pode algo como dizem gravidade zero mas lá fora um monte de gotas caindo.

Can you guys take a couple prominent flat earthers with you on one of these trips. Finally put an end to that whole scene. Or prove them right.
I didn't see 1 star. I looked up from earth and see them. Explain please!
Where the flat earthers at now?
Never even reached space. Idiots

And yet it is the best spaceship (for me).... SO SAD for Virgin Galatic😔
Why the sun wasn't burn their skin at space?
It looks stupid.
Everyone who’s visited Epstein island should be sent into space 🤦🏻‍♂️
We can proudly say how flat the earth is, sphere earthers are going underground thanks for showing real flat earth
Congratulations to the entire Virgin Galactic super team on this great event for the human race. but there is still some work and perfection to be done.   Example: Hand and foot holds.

Lol fish eye lens really lol...non sense...the earth is flat
Anyone know what that thumping is while they are floating around up there ?
WTF….. re-entry without a atmospheric burn ?
Por que os pilotos usam máscaras de oxigênio e os passageiros não?
Beautiful our Planet !!
They lost full control of the machine and apparently should have aborted.
When I was younger an old guy told me he became a jcb driver because he thought by 1999 people would regularly be travelling to the moon. He said he knew he could never be an astronaut but maybe they'd need machine drivers on the moon. Here we are 2023... what we scared of? Space is safe!
the eart is flat tho
I was really hoping to see the re entry.  Cool experience tho im sure.
you are liars
i hypothesis the stars we see at night maybe due to overlapping gravity fields
i think Branson has this partly right - but i think he missing out on the idea of newer designs for Jet engines - that will also be truer to ideas of warp drives; yet jet engines are space warping drives already..
I really want to take a flight to space
Yeah until someone panics and breaks a window
Why isn't a 8k Camera taken up to film everything 🤔? why is it all hidden
They can breathe inside?
So this is basically a Zero G plane.
Wonder what the flat earth folks minds are thinking now lol
I don't know if it's worth the $325,000.00 fare because I have no point of reference on that kind of cheddar.
The $450,000.00 price tag keeps me outta that loop.   $125,000.00 is refunded and $25,000.00 automatically gets you into the online club.
Hands down most beautiful flight to space EVER!!
Cant wait to see the new uniforms on the flight crew!
Not sure one flight every other year is going to be successful...
🤣60$-4dollar share 🤣🤣🤣
$450,000 USD for one ticket.
That's one expensive vomit comet. 🤔
How have I never heard of this wow
I noticed no one was taking any chances and they all had chutes on. Why did you edit out the 5 jeez on re-entry? I am guessing maybe someone panicked and it's not pretty, or lots of profanity and not appropriate for yt.

I am too old to ever appreciate such travel and besides my stomach would object to weightlessness. Perhaps my son or grandson? Price needs to come down and I would like to see more development on 'greening' such travel (Green Hydrogen?).

Crazy how even being that high you can't see the curve of the earth without using a fish eye lens
I don't know much about space travel,  but looking at this video it seems to me that it is the smartest and safest way to go to space.
How much does it cost
Why they don't put a camera outside of the ship.

One of the greatest moments I've ever watched, pushed me even further towards wanting to become a pilot
I wonder if this is only possible because of Mike Oldfield's musical master piece Tubular Bells
Of all the space ship branson virgin look most stable and cheapest. Even if you had engine failur on reentry it looks like the ship could be turned into a glider to safety
No re-entry video?? Did anyone see what looks like to be water coming from the aircraft while out in space? I don't know it's not convincing.

I asked my daughter 1 day what she wanted to do when she was older! She told me she wants to be an astronaut, the pride and emotional i felt was overwhelming to me that my child dreamt that high! A few years later i reminded her of her wish and she replied she will just be happy to see the world from space, no so much stay up there for amounts of time, i pray 1 day this amazing opportunity becomes a "relatively affordable" option for the general public because if i could do anything in my lifetime i would see to it my daughter lives out her dream!

Ричард Бренсон😉 доброго времени суток! Как здоровьеце ? Когда новая пушка полетит в космос, расскажи, я жду с нетерпением новые видео о ваших полетах в космос!🤩🥳
I want a seat on this trip. My earliest memory is flying a fighter jet (specifically an F16) 10 meters of the ground (I could see the wing nearly touching the ground as I banked, 5 meters or so beyond the wing tip). And as soon as I realized the Earth was a spinning ball in space my next dream was weightlessness above Earth. I've had those dreams so many times I cannot even count them. THANK YOU sir richard branson for getting on board with Burt Rutan's concept, its THE way to go suborbital, and it'll be a really cool way to travel soon (just remember to charge a profitable amount not like concorde who charged way too little, charge what someone thinks its worth to arrive from space for a dinner on another continent).
It's Faze Rugs turn

Looks amazing! But is it me or is none of them at ease? hahaha
Imagine a wedding proposal
fantastic .....
I'm convinced we didn't go to the moon now. After decades of research, Branson is only making it to the edge of space? Something doesn't add up.
But wait, where is my money Lebowski?

These people are fearless😢😢❤

Hmmm that explains how ISS crew flow inside the station . Thanks guys thats why flat earth community is true.
No fish eye on the camera that films outside the craft...

Jeff Bezos has already reserved a seat on this flight.
Best investment for 2022: RAN on the ASX. 99% down bargain growth stock
How much cost this flight?
Nice.
Either way, he's really cool. Greetings from Russia.
People: All rich guys are always at a party  At the same time rich people: look at earth, unbelievable.
Does anyone know if there's any investment in R&D so virgin can actually reach orbit? I feel this is a bit of a weakness as they will miss out on space hotel tourism.
I wanted to see the landing
Eva is happy now.
Well they didn't stay up there long
2:17 let's remove all the rubber seals from the windows
amazing    just amazing
Please make windows bigger.
just imagine
can i pay with crypto sir? :D
Somebody needs to tell Jeff Bezos that he has already lost to Virgin and SpaceX
Now that Sir Richard Branson has been to space, please redirect your resources, energy, and great looks to help clean the Earth's air and oceans! Do it before Bezos does.
A zero-G plane with a go-pro camera on it. And people just eat it up. Earth is flat, wake up.

I'm so proud of richard and😊 his adventures and caring spirit towards others.  I was once a child with a dream looking up to the stars. Now I'm an adult in a spaceship looking down to our beautiful Earth. To the next generation of dreamers: if we can do this, just imagine what you can do".
So what happens if something goes wrong
Ok, now get some drink on Moon while u guys r there lol
1. Commercial Airplane flies at 5 to 7 miles up into “orbit” 2. Bezos and Musk bottle rocket launches 8 miles into “orbit” 3. NASA space station is 220 miles into “orbit” 4. The moon is 240,000 fricken miles into “orbit”  5. NASA flew to the moon and back 480,000 miles in a 1972 carbureted bottle rocket. 6. Does any of this sound stupid to you?
Stunning view of our little big blue
One day the truth will come out about Branson …
I know I'm 2 months late, but congratulations Mr Branson. We, humans got another accomplishment.
And all we can say is: The Earth is flat 😆
Is this more efficient then Jeff bezo’s ship
I make huge profits on my investment since i started trading with Mrs Nicole Brusher, her portfolio set ups are amazing. My journey to space will be sooner than expected.
Faster than light drive. Mass reduction effect. Circular master, slave, with spark gap, over amprage coils. Master coil has a de-ionizer spike. Stacked in a nacelle, with each sequential coil flipped in a mirror image to the coils next to that coil set. All the paired coils are conected with the same facing coils, to capaciters on each coil of each set. Down the nacelle. The conection continues to the inverted coils in the nacelle. The last set of coils are conected to ground. Outside the ship, at rear of the ship naccelles. Via a uni-directional transister, electric flow outwards. To a de-ionizer spike. Counter spun sandwiched, like pole pemanent magnets. With coper sepantine dead center around perimitter of magnets. Inverted stater cross serpantine spark gap. Coper serpantine is grounded, via a uni-directional transiter. Electric flow inward. The serpentine has a pivited, plate like cone. Made up of aluminum, with outward spiral radiating spokes of thorium. Three quartes aluminum one quarter  thorium for the emitter dish. This is a false singularity, gavity projector. With a set of four nacelles. Projected supe photonic warp speeds, are fourty times the speed of light. minimal radiation aft of ship wake is expected. Protection fron radiation in space. Comes from the graviton, false singularity. At the front of the ship. Across the galaxie and back in five thousand years. The power for ship is produced, from a sonic quarts reacter.The reacter chamber is a capaciter, with stacked plates of quarts. Three d-printed. Reactive elements inbeded in quarts, produce self vibrating quarts. That are electric cascaded, via sub sonic frequencies. The reacter is conected to a capaciter bank.The recative elements inbeded in printed quarts. Can be oxegen, lthium, or mathane, oxegen, or amonia, sulfer and so on. Quarts can be singular elementas, inbeded or harder to make. Multi-elements in each plate, optimal.  Yours JOEL RAMIREZ RAMIREZ.
Please give a free ride to a couple of flat earthers :D
Surprised you can Internet up there
"Welcome To Space"  I felt that
Congraluation! That's a hugh step to Virgin! Hope our future generation of the public also can catch this for travelling!
Yeah, I think the conspiracy theory is right: Stars disappear when you reach that altitude, which puts NASA in a bad light.  É, acho que a teoria da conspiração está certa: As estrelas desaparecem quando se chega a essa altitude, isso coloca a NASA em maus lençóis.
CGI yet again, who was filming the rocket when it was in so called space that no one has ever been too.
Why is space flight footage always rolling like they're doing slow flips???
A cross between the Spruce Goose and Buck Rogers. Something us regular folks will never get to do. Bummer.
They should give a free flight for flat earthers
Literally they are children on a theme park ride. Ridiculous. What's the point of this? So billionaires can pollute space? It's nonsense.
Unbelievable is right
Mr Beast should totally make an episode about going to space
Mr Beast should totally make an episode like this
найобка
Yay he nearly reached the moon! I think he’s about 50 odd yrs behind  the guys that landed on the moon! Why with so much money to waste wouldn’t he want to build something to land there? Coz it’s all bollox!
Dalam laut ke byk bubble
Where is flat earth fans voice? Is that CGI?
1000x better than SpaceX!
This could all be faked like we think the moon landing is lol
#1:15 "The next gen of dream is , If we can do this, imagine what you can do".     NEIL ARMSTRONG LEFT THE CHAT
Why do they always use a fisheye lense. Why arent they wearing the harnesses?
I'll wait 20 years for cheap flights
Is the earth realy spherical?,anyone aboard,plz I need a clarification on this.
Sir said : if we can do this just imagine what you can do 💯🔥.
The thing that make it better is all of the crew is virgin 🗿
With the spirit of sportsmanship, I would like to say a big congratulations to him for this feat.
Musk fanboys are disliking this in full force.
Come on Tars.
Very glad this first flight went very well. Congrats to entire team and vendors. Was disappointed there was no live stream from inside space craft like is common with other space launches. All we see is highly edited version days after launch.
Richard, I thought you're going to experiment with how well champagne sprays in a weightless environment? 👀
🔝
Čím víc paliva tím víc strachu. Nevidím žádný jiný problém.
why nobody talk about the altitude? the altitude for to see earth's curve.......... just motivantional comments only
this is so cool.....
If theres a virgin galactic, is there a chad galactic?
Un comentario en español
Why fish eyed lense?  Need to hide the truth?
To the next generation of dreamer's..... We will expect a whole lot more. Amazing work Sir Richard
The Earth is flat , Genesis 1:14 ! Branson is a liar , i wonder how he can sleep at night
Itu bisa ga kacamatanya dibuka dulu?
How much green house gasses are given off on these flights just so a bunch of spoiled rich people can get a ride? Nothing scientific on these flights at all, what a waste of money and resources. Also coming form big advocates of global warming issues. Can we say hypocrite!
Nothing could be more fake than this.
hats off to this man and company--great feat!
Fake
pause at 1:41 earth is clearly flat.
They need to take a flat-Earthner  😂
Way fancy and better haha 😂
Tries to open window @ 2:18 lol
Was this  Brenson's first zero g experience?
Do you see how scared he was he didn't even take off his seat belt  he held on soo tight to the  chair  it shows u how much he don't trust his own plane    he just did it for fame
Planet earth is blue , and there's nothing i can do,
Looks pretty curved to me Flatearthlings.
i am richard branson and I have way to much fucking money
I want to live forever because of stuff like this. Imagine being the first "artist" or "painter" to travel from earth and record artistically the cosmos.    Its my dream to leave earth forever on a voyage through space and time and this gives me hope that we will get there within my lifetime.
They tell you to donate to win a trip to space i think they take your money and give the trip to their families and friends.
Yeah nice did you see the sun under the clouds 🤷🏾‍♂️🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🙈
👍👏👏
Man Richard looks so happy and that makes me feel really great tbh
1:39, when the earth line is vertical, it is straight, not curve.
I believe .34 to.39 camera had no fish eye lense.  All the windows in jet and other cameras have a fish eye lense to create curve, be it concave or convex.
It's amazing!!
Enjoy your LITTLE 50 mile journeys. Lots of us have much BIGGER plans for the future. See ya!
That is so cool!!  but one can't help but wonder what will happen if at some point one of the passengers does not strap in on time for re entry. With it now being commercial and any random person can purchase a ticket at some point someone will not get back to their seat on time. Anyone know if there is danger in that? not sure how rough it can get during re entry...
This is only the beginning…let’s work on a longer burn and heat shield so we can take this to full obit and safe re-entry.. 🎉
wow amazing it's great Experience
He was once a child. And now he's an adult, surround by other adults.
To all the flattards whining about why the cameras look different. We get it, you're clueless about photography.
This is AMAZING!!🎉 congrats
I'm here for the flat earth meltdowns don't mind me ✋
where is the stars?
No one Literally no one Rich people: "I go to space!"
Soo dope
its flat they were right
Flat earth
Question is: Are we still gonna let NASA keep stealing the taxpayers money to do NOTHING. hahaha.
Wow.....  B. F. D.
How long does zero gravity last?  This looks so exciting and I would love to go.  But there is no way I can ever pay for something like this because I'm living below the poverty level.  So I hope Virgin Galactic will have a contest for a free  suborbital flight.
Its awesome  keep it up
$250.000 for 3 minutes in space?
How many talented, gifted children for space discoveries are born recently?
You guys are soo lucky to visit space ..... which is my dream...😊😊😊😊
I wonder if the guy who was on board the exploding virgin spaceship is still the pilot.
Space orgy is the next thing.
so epic, gives me chills everytime!!
One way tickets for billionaires
WHATS THE POINT? ?? GLOBAL WARMING!!!😠😠😠 Hope it crashes👌👍👏👏👏
At 2:16 I thought he was trying to open the window. lol I was like NOOOOOO!
My man is high as a kite  Hence the shades lol
why ur stock went so down xD??
so i can read a newspaper in space?
0:10 when i eat too many spicy tacos
Next: virgin aquatic
дед кидала)
This is some revolutionary stuff imagine were this will take us with in this knew decade after some improvement and advancement of modern technology heck this might be the cheapest safest most common way to travel to space by 2030.
Anyone willing to give me a small loan of a hundred-billion dollars?
Send flat earther's up there.
why flight is short
I don't want to fucking go to space. I have more important things to do here on earth. Stop asking me for money on YouTube adds .
Got a Question for you all ,,, for all the tech to get into space it all boils down to electricity used to make these items SO we wish to go green YES reach for the stars to save earth and mankind YES ?  SO the QUESTION IS we have all this tech we need more power BASE LOAD POWER and yet i ask why are we not using twin stage hydro electric plants to make more power ?? Now if you said ,,SIMON THAT CAN'T WORK ,, and why is surging of the turbine will happen OR you said there will be to much back pressure issues !! WELL UR WRONG  It's because the powers that be are happy for you to pay more for less  see Facebook site RDP Marine Australia  YES MARINE its a add on for the dams to do what i said O and for the record 3-5% more
If I win 2 tickets i`ll be selling them
Impact on earth's environment???, if u care
Who could possibly believe this?
👍🏽👍🏽🙂🙂🙂🇨🇷🇨🇷😀😯😯
Change save the planet the survivors PLEASE
I will go to space next year
0:20-0:40 looks like some Wallace and grommet animation, that one episode where they go to the moon lol I also just watched Jeff bezzos video cz I saw someone comment how this video is better than his and it made me think why does every footage we have of being “in space” only consist of the inside of the aircraft? Never really so much of the outside also why doesn’t ANYONE PULL OUT THEIR CELLPHONE and record from that perspective like hello I would have my iphone out going on live on IG. Also you can’t say I wouldn’t have no reception cz  ALL the satellites are up there in “space” lol
1:05 Efek 0 grafitasi ternyata karena pesawat sedang meluncur ke bawah. Sehingga semua benda pada satu kecepatan yang sama, terjadilah seperti melayang... Luar biasa... Mantul 👍🏻👍🏻
😂 ادفع مليون عشان اتقلب 5 دقيقه وقلك يلا على البيت
Congrats on your accomplishments. You've done so much to improve  peoples lives. Have fun and success  always
I will go to space!!!
I see each person wears a backpack, is that a parachute?
Future is insane 👍🏃
I dont know what is this, but its fake!
Terraplanistas ainda acreditam na terra plana né
Fucking trash video. Nice fish eyed lens btw.
I wouldnt go there even if it was free!
A successful company that I would recommend investing in if the financial salary is deposited. Buy stock
0:58 whys her face like that
Balık gözü kamera artık yasaklansın ya bu ne abi
For just $450,000 you can book a flight.
This is sweet to watch
So bad for our planet...think pollution
Breathtaking
So how are you getting up there on unicorn farts and pixie dust? I guess Branson doesn't pollute the climate as he has billions and a privilege card.
Don't want to put a downer on this. It is great. But have we not wasted all the time since 1972 when the last moon mission happened to be celebrating a not even low earth orbit in 2021.  As a kid in 1980 I remember my father saying by 2020 he'd have a moon base and I'd probably be going on holiday there!😁
£450000 per seat and your wealth has granted you a perspective of our beautiful Earth that the majority of the Billions of people on this planet will never have the privilege of being able to see….and you’re goofing around pushing each other like kids and not even bothering to look. I would at least have the grace and decorum to act like an adult, take it all in and appreciate the significance of what you are being able to experience. More money than sense springs to mind. 🤦‍♂️
Historical.  First privately funded endeavor....and complete auto-pilot.
ha ha ha ha ha
Right, that's it! It's not buying those new trainers. I'm saving up...
IMO way cooler than bezos’ flying dong
eso fue épico
Who cares " to all you kids down there.....starve you scrots"
nice speech sir, but there no future generation. People have given up slowly roting our brains away.
What a bunch of lying grifters
Branson is a plutocrat indulging plutocrats. Nothing here will improve the lot of the common man.
Hope ya dope blow apart like that test flight a few years ago lol
Брэнсон иллюминатор отрывает!
I did save this man life once
Kimberly George @KimberlyGeorgee   @virgingalactic   @omaze  and  @SpaceHumanity what does it take for me to be the first transgender to be in space? I put an entry for flight and I want to be apart of history. I have lost my job and don't make the money to buy a ticket and I want to find a way to reach out to y'all with me wanting to be apart of history.
Poor people can feel this experience inside a deep swimming pool with a oxygen mask
Relish.. relish.. relish... 'goosebumps'
Mesmerizing  👌👌
1:46 flat earth
bUt ThE eArTh iS fLaT
Great experience
There goes flat earth theory out the window....hahaha
Wow.. literally. It's dream..🙏🙏
👏👏Richard is real dreamer and achiever
The moon is dull and full of abrasive dust, but it will have to serve as a dock for the next step.......Mars, I hope I'm still alive the day we land and start terraforming Mars. And I hope it will be done by a Portuguese
Who would have thought that "tubular bells" would have brought us to this
We live on a stationary plain, the sun and moon aren’t millions of miles away sheeple. Space is not real it’s a Freemasonic Kabbalahistic worship. All the Freemasonic celebs you see worship it  and are puppets who get told what to do they worship this 🪐👁⃤instead of our TRUE creator. The Bible and even the Quran tell the truth but they even twist some things in those too. Bezos is a mere puppet too the Zionist run the show. The own everything  all the stocks, media, the fed reserve, and shape your minds clearly for falling for this pegan BS garbage.
FAKE YOU ALL ARE LIARS AN DESTINED FOR GOD'S JUDGEMENTS
THIS VIDEO IS FAKE ASF
“Ladies and gentlemen, we have an expected orbital time of One hour and 32 minutes from Sydney Australia to New York City. Spaceship attendant, please prepare for blast off…”
The danger is overwhelming, btw I wonder if mark will try to do this?
How does it feel when you are floating in space? 6yr old here
Imagine all the indentured servants on mars
I don’t understand, why couldn’t they livestream  entering space ?
What I like with virgin galactic is that it's basically a plan that goes to space, imagine something bigger and with more rocket power and we could literally travel to the moon. A plane to the moon imagines that... Anyway, I feel this is a much more realistic way to go up than just on a regular rocket
Where are the stars ⭐️ 💫 🌟 ✨ ?????????????????
At 2:28…. The sun suddenly appeared 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
That was a complete old fart message 😷
Tanti PROBLEMI a terra , dei coglioni nello spazio!!!!
Santhosh George kulangara fan boy
I don’t agree with the use of the word Astronaut, I’m not a Pilot when I fly in a plane , Astronauts are highly trained individuals, not passengers, so no , you cannot call yourself an Astronaut by simply going for an expensive joy ride.
🤡
This is absolutely wonderful!!!
All is fake the whole video designed at local studio
CONGRATZ AFTER ADDING SUM "GIGANTOR" MISSILES TO YOUR CRAFT WE CAN JUST IMAGINE WHO REALLY OWNS THIS ATMOSPHERE SAID TO ALL YOUR COUNTRYS ON EARTH SATELITE SYSTEMS 🛰

The Earth is flat
Waiting for the turn of santhosh sir turn.... Kerala👍
They lied did not go to space
OMG, full of Rip van winkle clones sheesh
boy it sure looks flat huh? lolol
And yet we are suppose to believe that a sun that is 93 million miles away that illuminates the earth that space is black. What kind of cooker was this?
Melhor q a outra
Because of internet today we are seeing the view of real People in the space 🤗🤗
I love it. 👏👏👏
Incredible. 👏👍
This is awesome and I am proud of them!  But Why are they calling this the first human space flight?  Why?  It is not the first. The first space flight occurred in 2004 on spaceship One.
Thankyou to Richard branson for sharing the views with us rather unlike bezo who selfishly only allowed us to listen to his kiddies awe..we allowed to watch here..waste of money but hey not my money.
Better looking than bezos...better filmed..better speech...hell... branson u won this one...nice
Much better than Jeff Bezos flight.
Notice the women's hair moves as you expect in zero gravity, compare with women's hair "on" ISS where hair moves in a strange way, like its all hair sprayed, with a strange bounce, i.e not in zero gravity environment.
Love you reached brancen
Don't let ET see you Lol !!!!!
Saw it all in 1969 - what's this Back To The Future again Lol ?
So does this mean we have proof the earth is round?! Hallelujah. Lol
💙
Nice studio work. Nasa - Walt Disney 🖕
nice v..
Photoshoop mode gtfo satanists
Better then Bezos themepark attraction... but man,..its clear nothing comes close to spacex
a terra é plana?
An Indian astronaut nice
Thats just incredible
USD 250k per seat for a lifetime experience is very reasonable
Was it actual weightlessness or were they simply losing altitude once they reached 280k feet, giving the illusion of weightlessness? Remember that they were 50k feet short from actual space, i.e. the Karman line.

Wow. That man had a dream and went for it 👏
This os verter than Jeff bezos fly
Solve world hunger? Nah. Actually contribute to society in a meaningful way? Nah. Be in the stratosphere for 5 minutes? Sure!
Das cray
Pretty cool stuff. What's with the sunglasses ? Are they necessary for some functional purpose ? Are they pragmatic ? Or just something he likes to wear ? I haven't really followed Richard Branson or Virginia Galactic so I don't know
When online booking will start for space tourism I am very excited to land on moon
Looks very flat 😱
Let's be honest this jet is a much better looking design than the Jeff bezos typical looking rocket 🚀. I bet  bezos agrees
That's absolutely amazinggg
Now no one is caring about  pollution, ozone layer depletion, global warming .
If this is what you always dream of billionaire sir then enjoy it sometime then begin to dream another thing more father like build colonies on the moon. Always have purpose that make life way more healthy.
Watch this and see rich idiots spending people's money for useless event for the science and progress. 60 years have passed since Soviets first sent the man in space and now mass media PR this stupid amusement as great breakthrough. Just perceive the real regress. Eat the rich (c) Aerosmith
imagine what you can do! yes dude, imagine!
Pretty cool. Now take some inner city kids up.
✨✨✨
I think this is fake. Earth isn't supposed to look spherical above. It should be flat from one end to the other. I couldn't believe Branson had agreed with NASA and the US government to participate in spreading misinformation about Earth's real shape. It's a shame..
Фейк,Голивуд
I applaud both Sir Richard Branson and Jeff Bezos. Of the two, if I had the money, I would go up in the Virgin Galaxy. I was mesmerized by the X-15 program.  I have seen the two remaining X-15's and one of the B-52's that carried the X-15's.  I am just an old school guy.
Burt Rutan who's team designed and launched the first version of this aircraft into the air 20 years ago must be glad to see this day. Thanks to Branson for the help completing it.
No m&ms borrrrring! J/k at least there werent acting like children
I remember as a young boy seeing Richard talk about his dream of space flight. He was so passionate about it that it became my dream too. I gotta say Sir Richard Branson congratulations on accomplishing your dream. You and I will be fellow star travelers someday.
Pretty flat
Great achievement !, I'm old, my heros are still Chuck Yager (mach 1, 48,000' 1947) and all the pilots (astronauts) who followed and finally a civilian, never thought I'd live to see it. Awesome !
Congratulations 👏👏👏👏
The new Archer.
See, it is flat!! :)
Heroes of the naive - congratulations.
Let's hear from the dumb flat earthers about how this is all cgi lol
1:21 indian flag
2:14 the first airpod flying around in space 😂😅

What about shotguns in our schools, and top policeman shooting a sweet dog in rio de janeiro. Thiink of it as nevermore, as I used to , well, did not work up to now. Well, although I refer to our species human  as no wonder, as olimpic games suggest, I am forced to believe that those who suffered and or died for no reason while we sell fantastic prospects ofmankind achievements will somehow get compensation. I have got some seeing politicians in jail in my country
Молодцы
And devil is pushing one of them to open the window  Guess he was playing though  Love seeing this experience of theirs
Next Logan Paul and Ksi Box in space
سبحان الله
Majkel Roberts
Exelent:)
To dream it… and later in life to make your dream a reality… is a true blessing! Congratulations, Richard Branson!
What a DESPERATE MOVE
Fake af. Not a flat earther but that is fake. Like you wouldn't be wearing a go pro?
Ok flat earthers, where you at? I can not wait to hear why they think this is fake.
Earth 🌍 is round, confirmed 😆
This one is more attractive than Amazon
THC
I have some ocean front property in Arizona!
You think that we are sheep?Comeoooon!
I can’t see the stars ✨ 😂😂😂
What if virgin galactic liked my message?
People actually believe this Garbage 😂.
Jeff does not pay taxes so he could afford to build a rocket to take a joyride with his rich family and friends. We need those tax dollars for Infrastructure to build a better world. There is no planet B.
Those words... Just beautiful...
2:29 Looks like a flashlight not sun shining
devil shape space shuttle 😀😀
Hey someone could please explain to me why there is no stars visible and everything looks really dark?  Thank you!!
Street police
I’m here
Widget
Awesome
What about the the kids who are hungry right now. No food no shelter no internet and mobile phone. He accumulated so much money abd burnt it to see earth from that glass nd metal. And u guys r cheering an expensive selfish act.
Infinitely better than useless jeff bezos flight
who still believes earth is flat?
Star wars irl
Another question, why is your sunlight angle is the same in your going up/out and reentry?
You know what's funny about all this?   Flat Earthers ROFL.. ha ha you foolish foolish people
out of the blue question, where are the satellites? i did not see even a single satellite in an outer space base on this flight. footage frame at 1:16 and at 2:04., are they hiding? are you really in outer space?
I wanna see the on board cam when the booster ignites that would be cool
We live in a world where we don't have money to move water to the permanent regions of Africa , but has money to search for water on Mars. This only confirms that poverty exists because we cannot feed the poor but because we cannot satisy the rich. It's easy to be civilized harder to be human
Очень хорошо что люди осваивают безопасные полёты в космос! Это проект "Космический Илон Масковский Ковчег"✌️💁 Ведь разворачивать и бомбить метеориты и астероиды ,пока безопасно не могут!Нету такой практики! Но если ожидать когда то огромнейший астероид и то что он сделает месиво и пока оно осядет,то можно хотя бы в космосе переждать и спокойно вернутся на Землю для возрождения всего заново,но уже более опытными людьми и зная все технологии и процессы!!!
Wow. It’s like literally an airplane that can go to space?! That’s amazing and it’s such Ana advancement . It’s a blessing For anyone whose able to experience this, even if it’s for a couple of minutes
If this ain’t the biggest bs ever lmao ppl so gullible the earth literally is a inverted curve 🤣🤣🤣
At 2:17 you can you see him pulling the rubber from the window
I prefer this group. They enjoyed the view than play with ping pong and skittles.
"To infinity and beyond."..... Toy Story 1, great movie.
Ya this is what the world needs.
What a waste of fuel money. And pollution in the atmosphere
30 seconds of weightlessness = $20 million. Skydiving 🪂 is a cheaper thrill.
Space flight. Yeah right. This Branson guy, they really pulled the wool over his eyes.🤭
Waste of money.  They could eradicate famine
1:12 yes
Maravilhosooooooooo
WHAT's the big deal, for $250,000.00 you don't get a movie, peanuts or chip, a soda or water.....and there's no bathroom! What a RIP!!!!
THE EARTH IS FLAT, don't let them fool you, NASA (not a space agency) couldn't get to the moon! You can see bubbles coming out at 2:10mins in, looks like poor CGI & their filming in a pool, cut and edit job.
Oh no!!! they didnt get the chance to see the stars moon nor satellites !???
Ну разве это не чудо, вот и дожили до чего то нового, есть ещё нормальные люди изобретатели... Так может и дальше полетим...
My anxiety level got high watching them away from mankind
With respect I find these Billionaires could do something better with their money and leave Space Travel to NASA and other Major Countries who have been doing it for over 70 years. Our Earth has problems in third world countries such as poverty, starvation, homeless, etc etc. With just a small portion of the money spent on these Rich boys Toys I am sure the money could be used Better and appreciated by humans on Earth. We have to fix our problems here if we are to let our future Generations experience what we had and what we still have. Conservation and Global warming are Huge ISSUES! I just think these guys are using their money in a selfish money making ventures. Our Billionaires throughout the World should get together and seriously think of how they all can contribute to helping mankind and not themselves. It is grossly Unacceptable to millions of people on Our only Planet. David Attenborough I would Guess would Agree.
WOW just WOW, incomparable a 90 minutes space 🚀 tour vs a 10 minute Amazon joke.....Jeff bezos should continue with Amazon prime delivery
ЭТАЖЕРКА
Star wars is getting real
Nice studio performance 😜 quick come down hehe wonder why.... Most High is watching you👁️that's His space 🤣🤣🤣🤣next time try fly this and I might believe this acting video posted🛸
:"Four mission specialists"?? Meaning passengers?  The pilots, who flew the vehicle to an unpowered landing, same as the shuttle, weren't even important enough to name. Did they receive "Astronaut", wings? It was showtime for Richard.
Flat Earthers be like….
Expensive fun... Enjoy.
The future of tourism
Richard looks like captain of star trek love from India
Pity he didn’t bring a flat earther with him , would have been a great laugh
Ok guys unbuckle,,it’s recess…Are we there yet??
But isn’t the earth flat? 😂😂😂 jk
Mark Twain said something about all this.
0:54 Imagine being welcomed to space
Ściema ....
What about the radiation inside ship during flight?
When are we getting the GLOBE image?
Are they really this dumb, technically and scientifically they are NOT in space
Fake. The Earth is flat.
All of assuden they hit a pocket of gravity and then you see the smiles drop 😆! Over rated especially for that type of money 😆
Earth is flat
Could someone help please explain something. When I was growing up (born in the mid 90’s), I remember that in the mid 2000s I was watching a tv show with Branson (something about a competition and an island), the participants were also flying very high up and jumping in either zero g or close to zero g. How’s this trip different, isn’t it a similar basis? I’m just confused about the novelty here.  Still, congrats on the trip, Richard!
Как же это классно наверное. Молодцы.
This is the most pretentious thing on YouTube... "wElcOmE tO spAce, iVe bEeN hErE bEfOrE!"  Then dude be like oh is it time for me to start making my speech now that's suppose to, but fails, to sound organic an inspiring..   😆🙄🤦‍♂️
Richard branson is cirimnal
Better would be " to all you poor people"...
Yes sir, just spend ur money to fly in the orbit insteed to help poor people with ur money. You guys are sooo cool....
Looks like a lot of fun and what a view, they all soaked in the view and had weightless fun, all were strapped back in in under 12 seconds so looks safe to me
C'est marrant tous ce que l'on peut faire avec un ordinateur,on se croirait réellement dans l'espace
Wait the earth isn’t flat?
Is the moon 385k kilometers from EARTH? Hmmmm… really…, so let’s get old style….. maybe, global warming is making reality even more UNREALISTIC…., WHO KNOW? Maybe the MAN who WALKS DOWN THE moon’s WALLS. “VANS”
🤣
the rapture
Best spaceship 🚀 made by billionaires.
LOL
It's fake. Where's the reentry footage.
This makes me want to work hard to achieve this... I will literally cry with joy if I was lucky enough to look down on our beautiful earth from space.
Finding greta thunberg😂  Carbon footprint??
Virgin's rocket is the best looking out of all the others. Change my mind.
Hopefully we can keep our orbit cleaned up enough so many future flights occur.
Virgins uterus looking rocket and Bezos penis rocket. Birth of the new world order. The Freemason symbol.... so obvious anymore
Everyone on your team liked  for working hard  this success
That's it bruh?

Unlike Beezos and crew, at least they spent a lot of time looking out of the window.
That is it , spending 17 years just to go up there and remove your seatbelt 😂.One man mad this from home.
“Space is all a simulation until you become a millionaire”
Why didn't they show this ? All over tv
Wasn't suborbital spaceflight done back in the sixties?
PEOPLE! A parabolic arch! Gravity had them the entire time. They did not actually reach outer space. If they reached true outer space they would not have slowed down from the pull of gravity.
🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Nice cgi
I feel like humans should give it another 1 or 2 hundred years before thinking about space travel. Or we´ll end up as the intergalactic laughing stock. What would other, far more advanced civilizations think of us ? We´re killing each other for minor causes and a handful of people control the wealth of billions.Maybe we´re  all just part of a tv show that is broadcast around the universe and aliens watch to learn from our mistakes....
This could be done in the 1960s. Whooptywooooo 😀😁😂
I don't dream to live, I live to dream
I really have to think and work hard to reach at that level, thanks to Mr bezos
That's technically not in space...
Fake
yes, that's truth, I'm going to travel inside the sun one day.
I’m in. How much does it cost?
That evidence to go mars.
Could the Virgin logos be any bigger on this rocket ship. Sponsored by .... "you guessed it".
fake as all hell...nice try
Где маски блять?
Even if I'm not an expert, I think the altitude of 90,000 meters is by far not space. The weightlessness is reached artificially by parabolic flights. "Real weightlessness" starts a lot higher. So I would never pay 250K for such a short flight.
I think this would be a great stock to buy
A terra é plannnnaaaaa!!!!!!!kkkkkkkkkkkk
Where all the stars went?
why always use the fish eyes lens in the spaceship?
The design is cool, the only problem is that it is impossible to have artificial gravity in it without the magical gravity they have in sci-fi
....... Y estos guays  no contaminan ?. ........ Y los ciches electricos, no contaminan ?. Vayan a reírse de sus mamás , listos !!!!
1:39 flat earth.
Great. Now back to the world's suffering.
Clearly the land is flat. You could see on the horizon, without NASA's fisheye cameras, there's no way to hide.
Not too impressive..
In the 1960's 2 billion kids dreamt of buying a ticket to Space. 1,999,999,998 failed. This number is going to go down, but not much.
Imagine if Branson, Bezos and Musk got together. Individually they are amazing but what kind of stuff can they create together?
there not in space..just looks like it...its a nothing burger
You can hear and see the space junk 😮
find a way to stop the climate change should be a better  use of your money
That was crazy!!
Hey the cat's out of the bag the Earth is round
1:39 - AHAHHH... + the "0G" is cause they´re fallin.... nice...
Look closely, what are the bubbles? They appear twice at least.
👎👎👎👎
So you all realize that's not space right?  It's 15 km or 9mi short of getting to space.    This does nothing to advance humanity, just another thing for the ultra rich to enjoy.  If it was a reusable plane that could take a satellite to orbit, or a hypersonic transit aircraft that could reduce world wide travel to an hour, that would be something.
Unbelievable ✨🔥
Waiting on the FLAT EARTHERS to say this is fake...
Wow, how much?
I’ve been wanting to go into space for years and just found this from an ad on YouTube and just signed up for the info and future tickets and the flight and payload part too to find out about everything wish I could go now
You lost me when you said they were side by side !!? How is this not Max's corner ? He was more than half a car length ahead..
Great achievement for engineering but disappointed nobody was tempted to say… “Hey Snowy, I can see the pub from ‘ere”.
How They Landed?
pathetic.
Yes we all are there ..In that Blue bubble!🌍  What an incredible moment for humans 🥰🥰🤘
Looks pretty flat for me🤣🤣
I enjoyed and wish to go space once in my lifetime
"Don't Embarrassed By Your Failures , Learn From Them And Start Again. " :- Sir Richard Branson ✍️
Congratulations all team  Am waiting for space tour tickets 10 k to 20k dollars maybe it's possible before 2030 there's must come may company for space tourism
Lagi lagi cuma di studio... cGI wkwkwk
Dumb
Bizim de iha mız var. 😅😅
Didn't Virgin get a vast bailout from UK taxpayers in 2020? Look where the money went.
Hahahahahahahahaha.
Want to know what flat earthers have to say about it.
Wau
Fake!!!
It’s so nice that us cattle can watch what rich folk do with their cash.  Thank you rich people.
Sir Branson. Going vertically in a rocket is you know, OK. Taking off conventionally  and injecting into the ethereal in the way Unity 22 does it, is the better experience and builds a suspense that is lost in a vertical launch.. Hats off to you Sir. If I were one that was in that market, I would choose your method of injection beyond the stratosphere over all others currently.   A simply analogy, hot rod vs. Porsche. Needn't say more. You currently have the equivalent of a Porsche for Space Travel, pure experience getting there and the glow after arriving.
Richard Branson is my cousin. Not even lying
It is so pathetic that individuals will pay bunch of money to spend couple of minutes in space. Those money can be used much more efficiently for the overall benefit. It is a real cringe to see them excited as if they have just invented immortality or something similar.
This was a joke right?
For a richest man in the world, Jeff Bezos flight looks kinda cheap (?)
Definitely alot cooler better and more spacious then Jeff bezos flight
Branson did it better
2:19 trying to open the window?
I guess Mark Zuckerberg will be the second virgin in space then.
Is Branson the only one with a parachute on?
At 1:21 proud to see indian flag🇮🇳 on shirisha badla arm❤️❤️
See , the earth is flat
Someone show this video to flate earthers....😂
The race of space 🚀
Passengers: 🤩🤩🤩🤩 Pilots: 🗿🗿
For everyone who think the world is flat
I still think earth is flat😂
Congratulations
send one flat earther up there
where is the curve of earth? ..NO CURVE!!!!

JeffBezos space flight was teach compared to this
Decisions, decisions, end child  hunger… launch self into space ✅
He's so happy and in awe. I'm happy for him, what an experience that must be after all those years.
steel is fire as strides through life
1:22 we indians are bery proud  ❤❤ Jai hind
Yeah Virgin Galactic definitely looks like the more fun of the 3! 😏
🤣🤣🤣🤣 any one notice 0.55 sec Welcome to Space..  Same as Welcome to JURASSIC PARK🦕🦕🦕🦖🦖🦖
Where the ISS??
But what about pollution
Richard +floating weightless in the company of these brave young women + His own spaceship=Priceless Man knows how to travel.
What Will flat earth advocates say ???
Jota Martins chora kkk
I'm not in favour of space tourism, but this is an impressive achievement. The footage was great, too! Thanks to the amazing video shots we could actually become part of the experience. Thanks!
RICHARD BRANSON IS. AN INSPIRATIONAL PERSON. adventures all his life....
Put Bezos to shame
Jeff Bezos appeared in a trash can and tried to imitate you.  It was not filmed inside the vehicle like you did.  Amazing success congratulations.
This is better than Amazon head
His excitement, voice and words are stronger for the next generations than all the Apollo missions
Thanx for having solved all problems on earth, especially the whole climate issue...
Makes Bezo's launch look incredibly boring.
Branson: "To all you kids down there, I was once a child with a dream, looking up to the skies and wondering how much money I got to go to space..
That is the coolest thing I've ever seen besides my kids being born.
I like, congratulations.
Why do the pilots wear helmets and the rest don't. Or is that a stupid question. 🙈
Why are there no stars
Bezos “Weird flex!”
Look at the beautifull curve off the earth
That was an awesome looking spaceship Mr Branson! This is exciting
Wowww amazing how different this was from Bald Bezos , the quality of the video and spaceship is like first class compared to bezo’s Coach qualitylol how sad
Wonder what thelady with brace on the shine had, seemed liked a pump and something to give enforcement to.
help this planet 1st
Way better than Bezos
First wondered why Sir Branson would not get out of his seat, i guess he wanted to admire that awesome view. Though that weightlessness looks like fun and an unbelievable experience as well.
1:12 what is that shape?
I love the sound of no sound it's breathless
The next generation will suffer climate consequences because of him ♥️, GREAT JOB BRANSON
How, sad it did not explode
Why you want be rich? To do things like this. 🤩
Why don't these BILLIOANERS have a race to feed the starving
Chinh phục vũ trụ thì phải bỏ ra rất nhiều công sức chứ phóng 1 tên lửa lên vũ trụ để nhìn trái đất như thế nào nếu là con thì con ở nhà nằm ngủ sướng hơn
Thiết kế sao mà nó đẩy lần thứ 3, thứ 4 luôn xem nó đi đâu
nice!
Why isn't Brian May up there with you? How cool would it be to hear 39 up there? 🤣
silly deluded zombies that believes they live on globe upside down,wake up and open your mind
Nó làm giảm tốc độ của lực đẩy lần thứ 1 thì lần thứ 2 đẩy đi đâu, đi đc bao xa, thì chừng nào mới thấy dãi thiên hà và hành tinh nằm trên dải thiên hà :))
Reckon you can’t catch COVID in space 😂😂😂
1 giả thuyết ok nhưng ko ai đặt cái cánh kiểu đó cả
This looks clean asf unlike Jeff bezos who looks like he got all his parts from a junkyard
His words in space were much more profound than Bezos and Sir Richard spent time actually observing the earth. Cool video
Cringe.
Here are the elites who have found a new game !!! Lock yourself in an aquarium and pollute the planet. Whatever!!!!  Les élites qui ont trouvé un nouveau jeu!!! S'enfermer dans un aquarium et polluer la planète. N'importe quoi!!!!
They are not Truly in Space, they are still inside the earth's zone, layer. Pretty cool anyway
Oh look the world 🌎 isn’t flat
Chris Nolan should reshoot some scenes for Interstellar in space. Or make Interstellar 2 there.
Это самолет что ли 😳
Brilliant.
😂😂😂😂 quien se cree esto? Jajajajaja, más show imposible. Y lo toman como prueba irrefutable 😂
I wonder when Galactic stopped and how it stood still when it entered zero gravity?  It was seen flying like a rocket. Hard to digest, for me at least!
If I had $2 million instead of an expansive house or expensive cars I would blow my money on this!
Err even if it may not have happened, where are the stars???
Everyone congratulating to the virgin owner but no one talking about pilots effort😐..they made this amazing journey possible and safer☺
So, is the earth flat?
This looks dumb
It's 2021 you have cameras everywhere prove the flat earthers wrong
All that new tech we got and we ain't even got these camera shots on the Bezos space flight???...must be like China version...Branson delivered the USA pomp and circumstance :D...now how to actually make this useful to humanity...I can now see how we begin our new intercontinental city destroying missiles get more effective and cost efficient...hooray?
This flight is truly for Tourists. I could enjoy this more than Jeff Bezo's.
At 1:40 of the video, it shows the edge of the earth as flat. These space jokesters cant even edit their own videos correctly.  Omg
Max altitude?
Which mission is cheaper between this mission and Bezos's one? That should determine the future
The kid who went with Bezos for about $28 million could’ve bought like 90 tickets for this flight
Jeff Bezos flight compared to this is like iPhone to android this is so much better
This flight was much better than Jeff Bezos's!
Liars why haven’t you taken a picture of the ball earth! Keep deceiving the ignorants like you !
Love from india
Im proud richard preferred an indian girl 🇮🇳
cool .... but weird
To all you kids down there I was kids once a child with a dream looking up to the stars now I am an adult - Richard Branson
Big congratulations! Awesome exploit and tx you so much for sharing with us.
All that money to go to the EDGE OF SPACE The reason they don't go all the way and fly around in space is because there is no such thing you dummies
Wow a zero G plane. Never seen one before 😂
This is epic
Thank you for sharing your experience with the people your fight have video and people can see together with the crew you won the space race. Congratulations.
Richard 1 - Jeff 0
Environmental pollutants
Way better than Jeff Bezos. It flew back to earth! Mission accomplished.
can someone bar billionaires' reentry to planet earth?  lets turn these wasteful, pointless tourist expeditions into one-way tickets to oblivion.
I want to float in space before I die.
Lol to the next American dreamers start saving you're money 😆
Beautiful spacecraft, awesome crew, incredible flight, Jeff who?
What humanity can achieve and what Taliban and Pakistan is achieving by pushing world into darkness and sadness in the name of Islam.
🤦
No mames, vas al dizque espacio con lentes negros,
Earth is greatest planet ... I know this most costly but .. I love  land and sky...
Today Jeff Bezoz has achieved space race
@2:40 is a point where once commercialised, we will have people not sitting down, watching their tablets or on their phones in the future as we do with commercial flights now :D
Imagine that 90% of population belive this. 😂
Ay estos masones, al pueblo pan y circo 😂borregos
I liked Richard Brandon's space flight experience more. It was fun and inspiring. Jeff Bezos' spaceflight was plain boring and the landing is definitely not safe at all. This round, Sir Branson wins.
Its just a joyride for billionaires.
Actually an Outter space experience...
What was the ticket price ?
He should of Hugh Hefnered it and brought a bunch of hoes in Star Wars Princess Leia bikinis lmaooo would have been legendary
Notice the fish eye lens?
Is it the end for the earth planners? Or are the ship's windows of the "Fish Eye" type? Are there still earth planners after these space travels, which are filmed from takeoff to landing? Or are the cameras, the eyes of those on the ship, are they all of the "Fish-eye" type too?
This was visually better than blue origins flying dildo
OMG THE GUY WAS SO AFRAID  richard branson, was shitting himself ALL TIME from  1:00 when all the passengers lose the seat belt he started talking [in a clear PR speech] but everybody can see how much strength he puts to hold the chairs arm... I bet he wore those sungless to try hide a little bit how scared he was...  it was until 1:20 when a girl convinces him to release the belt and he tries... but it is noticeable how "out of the nest" he is, it is definitely not his comfort zone. I bet he only took courage to release the belt because he knew he was being filmed and wanted to advertise it as an "lifetime experience" but if he were alone he would be all time with eyes shut beggining to end.  So the final thoughts of this is that, this space flights might get in the eyes of curious billionares in the near future, but wont be for those 70yo 80yo guys like besos and this one... it will be for the late 30yo 40yo [assuming there isnt any 20yo billionare in this plannet]  so as long as the billionare population in this plannet is very low... and 250.000 IS A LOT OF MONEY TO PLAY WITH even for a millionare, i believe there wont be much public for space flight  even more because if any passenger decides to buy the ticket at impulse, then he gets there he shits himself like this one... videos and public reviews will be blasted of people scared and regret of the adventure...    lets wait until someone comes with an space elevator to get this thing more confortable/cheap
Dhruv rathi se Kon Kon aya
These flat earth/fake space comments are a joke. I bet some of them will buy a ticket, go to space, go back to their little cave, and make a crappy video of them explaining how they were just drugged with a chemical that makes them think they were in space.
The footage was much cooler and clearer on  Richard Branson flight and appeared safer
Mayday
Why space? Turds do floats in water too.
anyone here after Bezos 'joke effort...
the future will be megacorporations becoming space travel / exploration companies
En serio se que creen esto?
Disneyland 😂😂😂 80km = spațiu 😂😂😂
Greenscreen.                                           Just kidding, space.
👍
This was a thousand times better than Jeff bezos ‘s flight
Amazing 👏🏻
Looks flat af tho
Who is here after dhruv Rathee videos 😀 🤗
Congratulations.
Looks flat af.
And adult looking to a Beautiful Beautiful Earth WICH you are polluting and destroying with this sick necessity of going outerspace.. just so you can make some ungravity flips... COOL!!!
So badass
FLIGHT = 2021 ** Man has dreamed of flying high Since birds avoided his spear. Not until nineteen-o-three Was it done despite his fear.  With gasoline and engine, Propellers and wings for lift The Wright brothers flew their plane And gave mankind their gift.  Many countries built their planes As our world became insane. Planes were used in two world wars With bombs and bullets to rain.  Now we fly in outer space In search of life's creation. Though most succeed, some will die Pioneers of aviation.  Nothing else man can conceive Is more luring but God's sky. To be as one with the stars Is the wish of all who fly.  THANK YOU FOR WHO YOU ARE IN YOUR HEART !

Went to the moon in the 1960s. 2021 we go only to the edge of space 🤨 I thought we were supposed to progress not digress
Espetacular sucésso
much  much much much better than JB
1000 times better than blueorigin...
It's beautiful!.. but let us all not forget  how many humans are destroying our earth. I wish all the damage done to Earth could stop❤️💔🌎
Bezos’ flight feels like sheet show compared to this
Is it possible to bring germs from outer space that can cause a virus of epidemic proportions.
See, told you the earth was flat
this is a lot better video than that Bozo flight !
Не прошло и 50 лет, как американцы снова смогли добраться до космоса. Ура!
This was so much better than the Jeff Bezos flight

Looks pretty fucking flat to me. Shame you couldn’t to the other side. Did you see Epstein up there?
just wonderful to see
Boyhood dream made into a national treasure is an insult. We did space in the 50s and still haven't solved cancer or poverty. You could have just built a new Concord! Utterly Pathetic, stupid and backward. Branson ain't worth a scout badge let alone an astronaut badge.
This is soo fake
Strange...look a the blond girls hair as they float around the cabin. Now look at her hair as she flops back down in her seat to strap in...her hair no longer shows weightlessness, it just flops down...strange.
You didnt go to space... you fell short by 20miles and didnt even orbit the planet once!
wy tu gadu-gadu a ponoć w USA osobą zaszczepionym zabroniono pracy w przemyśle spożywczym i farmaceutycznym
Oh take me for a flight please!!!!! 😢 Just to feel zero gravity!!!! I'm envious. Congratulations none the less! LoL
This is not a space flight but high altitude   flight by plane.
That is not space that is high altitude
2:18 I would be pissed if a new car was this poorly built let alone a spaceship. Or wait.

Too cool...great for kids ;)......congratulations Richard!.
You for got the Redbull parachuter
When I was a kid I had a dream. Now I am an adult watching..........😁😁😁🤣🤣🤣
Here is something for you to digest Richard... rather than jetting off above the earth's atmosphere with your other rich chums .. how about you stay grounded on planet earth look around you and see what can be done to the planet we live on ... I'm surprised space had room for your ego up there ... one more thing stop avoiding paying your taxes ... you sir are a tool.
looks like cleaner way to get to the space ... not so much wight can carry, but not so much fuel is needed ...
Мне стыдно на Россию где не могут такое И рад за США где такое возможно
Man I lost the bet I bet this 💩was gonna explode 😂

Space maybe the final frontier but is made in a Hollywood basement...
Branson's next step: Moon and Mars!
It looks just like flight. After 100 years space flight will be common like everyday
The technology flying around, being called UFOs, is obvious at this point.  The question is, why and who is holding it all back?
A godamn wasted of resources, first time we sent useless people to space.
Ecologic
I wonder if they seen any UFOs out there
Its impossible for me to experience this
Is this real
Flat earther be like" his window shape is round"
I am looking forward to winning the Omaze competition and joining him up there.
Nice curvature editing... one  still gets the odd glimpse of a FLAT realm...  thanks for sharing this.

Why these fisheye lensess🥺🥺
Flat earthers ??? All i hear is crickets..  anyone??  No guess not. Back to the drawing board eh??

He didn't go to "space" he went into inner orbit. What a waste of money
Flat earth believers left the group!
But congrats on getting close to inner space
They are NOT in space they are in orbit..otherwise the radiation that surrounds earth would have melted them like butter in a microwave.
your move now, flat earthers.
Sir Richards speech will live on for decades
Now we can finally launch flat-earthers into Outer Space.
A great thing. The world limits the use of fossil fuels, cars will be battery operated, in the EU I cannot use a fireplace and here 3 companies will fly into space for the whims of the rich. I understand that these rockets will fly on batteries or solar panels?
So happy for them!!
Is this a joke we have Base in the Moon
I want to be a virgin like that
what happens when a rock hits the windshield?
You badly need handholds in the passenger section
Re-entry? Errr, okay...
Flat earthers be like "fish eye lens bruh"
What complete BS. I mean, yea they did it, but it's still complete BS. It might be high enough to be called "space", but it wasn't, or re-entry would have killed them.
flat earthers goes brrr
Круто ))) видно сыканул норм Ричард))

Just wondering how much carbon this released into the atmosphere, oh yeah, these turds can do whatever they want.
Nice Video which shows best practice how to waste recources, money and destroying or Planet in the meanwhile.🤦
NOW HOW ABOUT :  1) Having passengers onboard mothership with VR headsets that are linked to telemetry onboard VSS.  2) Similarly folks around the world can also experience the same although with some additional lag. It could be an xbox/ps5 $10 subscription servicing millions of viewers. Microsoft can easily host this or even Google Stadia. 3) Work with Roberts Space Industries and create future VG  NFT spaceships that can travel to other worlds etc. STEM for kids and adults. 4) Open up spaceport to host other services. pilot training, passenger training and experimental payloads. Monetize everything!  5) Use all the above to fund spaceport-to-spaceport mach-3+ travel that will replace private-jets and first-class cabins. Use hydrogen fuel for high-altitude 100% clean engines before igniting rocket boosters at 70K feet. 6) Spaceports can be 50 miles outside major cities and linked with Virgin hyperloops.
That’s stunning too bad I would be too scared to do that 😂
@1:27 “Richard, you are the man”. A bit of judicious creeping always goes down well when the recipient already has an ego the size of Jupiter!
Oooo, look a rich man massages his ego.
An old man, who doesn’t give a f*** about poverty, hunger and paying taxes. This is simply asocial and ignorant. Shame on him.
The whole world is on hold because of enviromental issues and these . . . I'm sorry to use this language . . . assholes get the go ahead to pollute on a major scale for nothing but their rich prevalideged pleasure. Please blow up . . . please !
Salam buat adudu
now you believe the earth is not flat dude 🤣
He has enough money to help people, but being in space is more important, making sure that people can pay to fly in space Init ...
Congratulations!
id never call it Virgin, you dont know whether it will go all the way...
Omg
What are the loud bangs they keep hearing inside the cabin when in space? Is space just that quiet to where little sounds amplify?
Seems to me like the earth really is flat.
Staged !!
Alguien Habla español Xd ?

Someone have an idea how many pollution this shuttle get in atmosphere? This is a new green economy right? Fuckin' idiots!
Bravo !
Finally cameras are getting better up there.
Ithokke pande tomum jerriyum vidda scene aa
Unbelievable this is happening when they telling us no gas boilers bonfires etc global warming lockdown fickers
Fucking fake video again to manipulate covidians
It’ll happen but not in my lifetime 😥 but the Star Wars ships and travel will actually happen!!!! 👍😉
In and out on the edge of space.Millions wow.
How is this helping prevent "GLOBAL WARMING"? ..bunch of hypocrites.
Selfish man. As if the world needs more pollution. His money would be better spent cleaning up our oceans rather than polluting them.
Belle teste di capra... Visto che avete tanti soldi invece di fare le giratina nello spazio aiutate chi ha bisogno
You Tube have stated that under no circumstances can they allow a flerf idiot to go on one of these flights as it will seriously impact their revenue.
Главное сказать - Добро пожаловать в глубокий Космос - а то что до космоса ещё пилить и пилить - это не важно!
You're a jock, gays you couldn't make people believe in the space and that s what all you did 80km is not even far to feel no gravity so what you did is slow landing to feel like there is no gravity 😂😂😂😭
Pay your taxes ya bum
Everyone thinks this is so great that a billionaire is going into space they preach about climate change that they continue to let people destroy the ozone including NASA in other countries so don't tell us about carbon emission pollution as long as we continue to allow this Chemtrails from airplane nuclear waste so let's get it right people
The leader of flat earth society need to buy one ticket
В чем прикол этого полета?
When you go thru the firmament.
And they tell us don't use cars to go to work because it affects global warming.  What about this sort of journey?
Did that thing launch from a plane?!? This is revolutionary!
when he said "unbelievable" several times i thought he would be complaining about someone's fart.
There are a lot of people who want to go into space and feel zero gravity
Imagine buying $SPCE stock
Вам надо ещё такой самолёт в Европе. И тогда открыть быструю авиалинию.

Pergunta: " Onde está a borda da terra plana ?
Ok this a great- for a start.  To get to real space we just need to start something & this is it,  a Baby Step, but still a step closer.  Great job.     So--->  2:00 what is she  doing with that leg brace thing??
People will pay 1 million dollars (as the ceo claimed) for a 4 minute trip to space.  Well.. They can get the same sensation with a 20$ pill and it would last much longer. No pollution too...
Can eat something" in flight
Awesome achievement!
What Mr Branson’s calls hovering by anti- grativity quackishly is merely like free fall at a parachute jump inside a tin sheeting which falls towards the earth surface with the same speed or acceleration. Every parabolic flight works on the same principle. It ‘s just an illusion to enjoy anti- grativity outside an orbital flight.
Hati2 ya mendarat ke buminya

Great Accomplishment Richard.
I can't see the curve😂
Did you see any UFOs. Please advise
Hay muchos niños que su sueño es simplemente poder comer y jugar  todos los días de su infancia y es mucho más barato  que un cohete espacial .
Waste of time and money. But congrats I guess
Anyone spotted INDIAN flag 🇮🇳 at 1:21 ?
Speechless absolutely stunning views from space
Fakee
Why are there no stars appearing?
Congratulations to you Richard and your team! 💐🥳🎂🥂
Nice fake 😂😂😂
In un pianeta in cui la gente muore di fame i ricchi vivono di capricci.
Загнивающий запад, хуле😂😂😂😂😂
😂😂🤣
Our Santhosh George Kulangalara sir, the proud of Kerala, is proud to say that he is a part of this mission.cheers.....😍😍😍
Sooo ahhhh.....we can clearly see the earth is spherical in shape....anyone heard from them flat earthers recently?😂😂😂😂
Parabolic flight nothing more
How bout them van Allen radiation belts ..lol ..space ...
Well... Guess What.... Earth is not flat!!! Loool
Yall do know this is fake right? Space doesnt exist and the earth is flat!!!
Idiot
Bilioneers stolled our world. Kid in the space.
സന്തോഷ്‌ ജോർജ് കുളങ്ങര fans😻
Wow breaking news! People in space floating around.
Where is the space i didnt see anything druing this video hahaha
While kids are starving in the world, Bill Gates buddy his playing in his fake rocket
Wow, really high altitude flight, hope they actually make it into space next time 😅
Fake
It would be SUCH a tragedy if the flight carrying big techs CEO’s burned up on re-entry.
The earth is flat flat flat........
Who the hell do this benefit?? Geesh
Super.
Generalnie👏
Absolutely incredible.  I was smiling like a child.  Congrats on achieving this milestone!
Nice job ! And as a bonus they just debunked the flat earth bs
I wonder if the cell service was better than on earth!
El espacio comienza a los 100 km de altura, estos en ese avioncito no subieron a más de 80kms según ellos. A esa altura la gravedad es casi tan fuerte como en la superficie. Ese efecto de flotar lo consiguieron al hacer caer el avión libremente. ESTO ES UNA FARSA, QUIEREN REFORZAR UN ENGAÑO.
Capricorn 1 right there. Nonsense
Dreams that have been dreamt are already true, they are not meant to become reality.
Now build a time machine lol
Why do the pilots need oxygen masks?
Earth is not beautiful anymore, why don’t these billionaires invest to rebuild the earth instead of this Publicity stunt....??
Richard Branson avec les cheveux courts, ça ne lui va pas!💔😡👹🤬💔
Congratulations sir
Never will anyone go to space because EARTH is Flat space is made in a Hollywood basement he went up to the FIRMAMENT is all. Lookup FIRMAMENT 👌ok
A pity this arrogant narcissistic billionaire  couldn't put his money to better use rather than indulging his ego with vanity projects.
Half this comment section needs to stop being miserable for 5 minutes to appreciate this accomplishment. ITS A COMMERCIAL SPACEFLIGHT FOR CHRIST SAKE!
One year ago he was begging for a Goverment bailout for virgin airlines… one year later this ! Really…
Aviãozinho com cú pegando fogo!🔥🔥🔥
How much did this cost.cos me thinks the monies you spent could have helped our own planet mr Branson.
😂
It's hard to believe when I saw my test results turned negative of HSV2 after using the herbal medications I got from Dr. IGUDIA, A great doctor who I came across on YouTube. You all can also contact him for help on any kind of disease on his YouTube channel
Je ne regarde pas, j'écris simplement que son délire m'importe peu.
It's amazing but , how much time they get into space? Lol
I'd rather go on a rocket tbh
Looks round! Who would of thought
can the flat earth people ask him of 9ts flat or not
How out of touch is this guy? Way to waste money that could have gone to help suffering people.
🔥
Extra Fake
Chupa terraplanistas!!!!
Still glad I sold at $49.
Это великолепно🔥🔥🔥
Bet they still got charged for going over there 25kg baggage allowance
The mans an absolute self centred disgrace.. he should be dragged back to Britain in chains and whipped and stripped of his knighthood … at the start of this pandemic  who was first in the queue  Asking for a gov handout then expecting his staff which he’s apparently so concerned about take six weeks unpaid leave
que se vayan a marte y se queden allí...
@Richard Branson ...is it possible to make somke there on Virgin?? (specially when feeling massless)
We łbach się popierdoliło... Wy kurs swiat ratujcie a nie se latać w ciul
1:35 his hands are shaking :o
I'm maybe too curious but am i only one who think this whole sh**t is fake?!?
Nice
Why isn't the earth round anymore at 1:37 mark?
The Virgin... Never Did Penetrate the Firm-ament...! Another Hoax to entertain the Brainwashed Sheeple.
CGI fake lol
I seen this at Disney Land
Just to the the edge 😂
The erff is flat.
hoax
2:17 lol trying to escape or what
I am happy for mister Branson. That is something really cool. BUT. this seems to me as a high altitude airplane , doing some parabolic flight
😂😂😂
I would better give 250.000$ to poor children and close my eyes for the 3 minutes that their are into space, thinking how happy they are.
Oni nie wylecieli poza atmosfetę Ziemi, więc byli w dupie, a nie w kosmosie.
Edge of space looks great... Edge... Yes edge.
The amazing thing about Richard, is that he probably was high af before take off, as a w**d consumer probably thought, why not? Haha just imagine that for the sunglasses
Yet another bucket-list ego-trip for Branson. So much more exciting what SpaceX is doing with StarLink, sending up satellites to connect all remote areas of Earth to the internet.
Low earth orbit. Nothing more nothing less.
Ufo at 2:10
What bored rich people do, how nice. Ok Branson you had your turn now let Bezo's have a turn. And after that for another $150 million we will throw in a 5 minute space walk. Pathetic.
When I first heard and read about the virgin Galactic project I always thought there was something a bit off about it, like it wasn’t really necessary. But seeing this changes that. We’re entering a new age. It’s pretty awesome.
Grow TF up
Suborbit is space?
The rich need to be taxed
Why are you lying? You have barely reached the mesosphere! That's not SPACE!!! That is one of the Earth's atmospheres! Hello!!!! Trickster/fraudster you are!
Viva el Sevilla Fútbol Club
absolutely senseless .. this rich people just need attention and like to show what they can afford.. 😏
I see Indian flag 🇮🇳
Bransons  a fuckinglegwnd 🙌
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Parabéns, toda equipe,
It's not space,it's the upper atmosphere.remember Virgin Mobile? Nobody does.
Супер круто!!!! Привет из Питера из России!!!!
Ok, so how much will it cost for a trip to space? 😁
Gready tax dodging Branson I was hoping that window was going to blow out such a shame.
Flat Earthers, where are you hiding??
Re fake. jajajajaj
1:19 2 bubbles 👀
Aside from my doubts that this constitutes space flight, I’ve got a question:  The pilots are wearing o2 masks… why? They’re not in pressure suits and no one in the back is masked. A loss of cabin pressure at that altitude would render you just about instantly dead I would think… well above the Armstrong line. If they’re for lower altitude flight then okay I guess, but that doesn’t seem like the phase of flight where this thing would likely suffer an issue.
Brilliant @virgingalactic.....what a great feat for all concerned.....real astronauts
This is unbelievable amazing you are great sir proud moments for india also 💐💐💐💐
So fake
El mundo muriendo de hambre y estos millonarios derrochando dinero, la humanidad está podrida.
Very cool. The mainstream media never showed this part or the speech he gave. He is right. If he can accomplish that imagine what someone 50 years younger could accomplish once that time comes.
who were the pilots of the spaceship?
Earth is flat ???
Thank you President Trump
Wow how much does it Cost?
Fake 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Holywood
So now is fact that earth is sphere
My dream : money ha ha ha
Божественно, очень здорово👍эмоции переполняют. Купоголовые-плоскоземцы утритесь...
ma non se le bruciano le palle questi ?

Toute cette energie pour ça.....
Maldito Circo !!!!
So freaking cool.
I may have believed this a few years ago but not anymore
Looks like a bunch of school kids went for excursion.😀😀
Why not show re-entry
Thought you were skint
Virgin Galactic uses the term “space” quite loosely it seems.   0:34 video footage taken by a “space” drone I guess shows charred fuselage from rocket propulsion....3:04 upon landing it seems that “space” gnomes have wiped the mothership clean.  Hot apple fail for dinner for VG.
All the elitist assholes concerned about the earth and the environment, they sure seem to use a lot of fossil fuels themselves.
Bravo ....GÉNIAL
Meanwhile millions on the ground wont have fresh water today and will forget to look up
He used taxpayers money to furlough staff. Now he's treating himself to a space trip. And there are members of the public who see nothing wrong with this 🤦
Maravilhoso!!!!!!!!
Richard Branson's voice sounds similar to the dude that narrated the Hindenburg disaster on the radio... "Oh the humanityyyyy!!!"
and sadly they did not burn up during re entry...
Congrats👍 ഇനി ഇതൊന്ന് മലയാളത്തിൽ കാണണം, നമ്മുടെ സഫാരിയിൽ❤
That’s not flying!  That’s just falling…. With style!
Cool 👍
On THE next fly we will have 1. FREE GRAVITY PORN...
La Terra è Piatta !
Trying to compare this to the footage shown on the live stream and there seems to be a few inconsistencies…oh boy here we go again
The Virgin Symbol on the bottom is sooooo tacky lolol
He meant next generation of billionaires not dreamers
Are those parachutes their wearing?
I CALL BULL$HIT.   No in cabin video of the rocket firing? Let us see the un-cut video...you won't!
GET SOME!
Gotta love how the Earth looks curved from the outside camera. But from the inside camera it shows a flat horizon through the widows...
Not for the working class  like me or you. Only for the super rich
Hold on, as much love as I have for Branson Wikipedia describes him as a commercial astronaut. GTFOH!
People have been in space before, nothing interesting here. Let me know when Branson sets foot on Mars.
People starving and he wants to go to earths lower orbit 🤔 just shows the ego
im not sure how to got into Zero G when they were still in the atmosphere
That's not a REAL space flight.
0:06 3, 2, 1 Releash Releash Releash! Epic journey indeed!
Совершенно бестолковое занятие...
Fake
Imagine if these people put thier time and effort investing in our infrastructure and cleaning up the enviroment rather than get thier dicks hard in space
Unbelievable how fake this is. Slow it down and look for the “NASA swimming pool bubbles”. They are just spectacular. And gravity came back just as they buckled up for “reentry”. Look at her ponytail sheeple.
He landed and undoubtedly immediately proceeded to lecture the commoners on burning fossil fuels.
hello, there are youtube channels in the world, who are doubting their launch, Richard, try to demonstrate them with a longer duration in space, about 25 or 35 minutes more, and have more surprises in the course of time.
Fake
Happy for you guys! That was pretty awesome!
Pra mim um humilde brasileiro entre 200.000 ou um homosapiens entre 7.000.000.000, neste lindo planeta azul , apenas um sonho experimentar algo fantástico assim! Parabéns pelo feito!
Glad you got your teeth fixed before the flight ! You can only do this because you have the money!
Dont think its sad but just dont impres me at all a bunch of millionarires spending milions of resources just to get a selfie . What a find sad its thousands of normal people flipping it out as if it was a big step forward for the human being.
Otw..
And why do we only have composite pictures cgi'd of the earth?? Point your Iphone out the window,take a pic and post that sh*t!!...please👀
Hoax
Fantastic .....ceck in for mi
Хорошо когда из жопы деньги лезут
The BIGGEST SHAME EVER THE BUBBLES ARE KILLING ME STOP YOUR BS.
സന്തോഷ് ജോർജ്ജ് കുളങ്ങര യുടെ അവസരവും.. അതിന്റെ വിശേഷങ്ങൾ ക്കും കാത്തിരിക്കാം 😝
This without music feels intense and scary. It should have been added.
How disgustig
Idk why everyone is jealous as hell he achieved what he wanted go someone else you losers  If future space travel will be affordable it'll be thanks to these guys someone has to start doing thing instead of complaining lile yoi people
Looks so fake
Imagine smoking a joint pumping snoop Dogg in space. 💯🔥
Anyone do Stock?   Anyone heard of 88E???
During this time,billion people dying of starvation, hope you enjoy your flight.
If only he took Adonis, Corbyn, Abbott, that black woman who tried stopping brexit that used to be a model, the labour party, the lib Dems, that fat fella who got paid to shout stop brexit outside parliament, the house of lords, the BBC and France with him😂😂
Its all bonkers, its a pity Branson could not stay up there.
Funded by the taxpayer!!!! Virgin health sueing nhs when they lose a contract legally !  Made out out to be Buzz lightyear by media
The greatest and the most expensive toy ever made
Its great to see a civilian non combative aircraft for a change that has made it into the publics eye...   I do hope that this will help spark off more innovations that assist the public over government warfare.
Weak effort.... Very low altitude orbit... not astronauts!!!
It’s amazing to see the flat and level horizon, & then the concave horizon, proving the use of fisheye lenses.   Thanks guys for helping people to see the true shape of the earth   I never thought you would do it live   Congrats
Werner von braun , the person who "sent" the first astronauts to the moon only has psalms 19.1 on his headstone. Think he knew the real story.
What one has to do to pump the stock
2:21  flatards will say "fish-eye lens bro"   their eyes are not fish eye... i dislike RB ,but thanks to him in few years the flatard community will fade...
Take your bank card with you and don’t come back 👍
Everything scripted
අභ්‍යවකාශයේ දී මිනිසා කෙතරම් කුඩා දෙයක්ද
Could she get that mouth any wider???
Are they wearing parachutes?
Натянули миллиардера на бабло, а в космос так и не запустили. На 76-м мог так же чувство невесомости испытать за гораздо меньшие бабки. В общем развели лоха.
Im strugelin get money for my family  they fly to space   😔
Anyone else noticed the plane is just making zero g loopings? 😊🤣
Richard branson - f*ck you neil armstrong, my speech will be better!.. but fails miserably
Pollution, indulgence, egotism, a waste of an opportunity to really help human beings, people dying and struggling with their daily lives with covid and these idiots want all the limelight by flying a plane really high, should be ashamed of themselves. Boycott Virgin.
Huge Congratulations!! You are a Legend Mr Branson!!
Earth is flat
I used to think snorting coke meant you had to much money. Now this.
Quien dijo que eso es el Espacio y que ese avióncito es capaz de hacerlo, no se dejen engañar
People at 35,000ft in a Boeing - Closes shade and sleeps the flight away  People scuba diving -  hey look, I'm weightless
He did nothing and the new mexico tax payers paid $220 million in taxes for this flight to happen.   The one in this flught that deserve any atte tion shluld be tbe piolts an test piolts they risked far more. Then theres the team that did the math an the team tht built his ship an got nothing .
Brilliant Visionary Richard👍💫🤗
Could be out the curing cancer but they're doing this. Oh wait. That's right, there's no money in curing people.
Ça pollue ?
Хороший понт дороже денег , особенно , когда денег дох@я 😜😂
Propagande
💪👍👏
Позор для американцев.  В то время как Россия запускает настоящие корабли в космос. Американцы дурят голову другим людям. Видно дела совсем прохи.
Даа,батутчик теперь и без космических туристов останется ..
This was probably his best flight ever expect for the ones he took on the Lolita Express with Epstein.
I don’t think they went fully into outer space. Just on the edge.
I know it that the earth is flat
He spent years lobbying to change laws on taxes and stuff like that to make the rich richer thats how they afford this! Not through hard work its all money and power
The re entry would have been more interesting to watch, something fishy here.
This looks like a 90s music video
We are waiting for Santhosh George Kulangara.
Massive ego trip complete
1.44 почему впуклая? пздц они людей за дебилов держат
Remember when Mr B went cap in hand to the Australian government saying that unless they gave him millions of $$$ he'd have to reduce flight services and lay staff off in the Australia's ? I guess the cost of doing the research, construction and the end product of this project must of only cost pennies then ?
There not in space. Man doesn't go into space. How do star formations remain exactly the same forever. Every time you see the plough the stars are in the exact same alignment. Now unless they are all exactly the same distance away, and close to each other. It's not possible. Seeing as we are told everything is hurtling through the universe at crazy speeds. Which would mean closer so called stars woukd seemingly look like there going past faster. And therefore the alignment could not possibly remain the same. Think of an aeroplane going overhead. Travelling over 500mph. It takes a while to pass your vision. Now watch a bird which is slower but nearer to you go past. It's gone in a few seconds. Why. Because it's nearer to you. Star formations should be constantly changing.
Question. What's is on the floor under Brandon's chair when he gets up?
You can tell we're in space because of the fish eye lens...
Wow great 😀😀😀
Do we have economical option? I'm willing to stand in whole journey😂😂
Too bad they didn't reach outer space 😆
Joff bezef is crying right now
嗰條友好似詹士高賓。
Greetings from🇮🇳🇮🇳
Soo. Old...  should of sent a casket.
Неплохая альтернатива настоящиму полёту в космос!
There are no stars
It didn't go into space!!!
What do ya know!  The Earth is round!
Parabéns pela iniciativa tão arrojada e nobre, esse é um ocorrido que irá ajudar a construir uma nova visão do espaço e quem sabe abrir as portas de um novo mundo no sentido literal. Que Deus possa guiar nossos passos sempre 🙏🙏👏👏
I don’t understand how people still believe we’ve been in space, we live in a close system. They are lying.
I was wondering if someone opened the window to let the fresh air go through
Totally fake. 🏌🏾‍♂️.'🌩️😵🥴
is earth flat guys?
Not really space but ok...
Rich kids with their new toys
Hmm, thought the world would look flat from up there.
Sorry Richard, Elon beat you too it. His stuff aint for fun. Nice publicity stunt tho!
So much for flat earthers looks spherical  to me.
What a bunch of fools.
Dreams come true
A hundred years ago, this must be what the first aviators felt. Now, People get on an airplane now and think nothing of it.
I don't care that billionaires are going to space.  Waste of money
idk, seems pretty round to me
👍
where is all the flat Earthers ???? 😂🤣😂
They put a virgin in space??
Only the rich will be able to afford this.
I love how nasa is steering us away from them so they can continue their private journey's and missions in regards to military ideas. So what they do is come up with private companies to keep us occupied. I'm not an idiot. Lol
Minuto 2:34 🤔
Tá louco Man ...eu quero ir pô
Tá louco Man ...eu quero ir pô
We are so thankful for the Dreamers and Visionaries.  And Sir Richard took this opportunity to inspire the next generation.  We are thankful to the Lord that his historic flight was just perfect!!!!
Rice undeserving POS
What???? Just one minute up there
Such a waste. Out of touch people
So what was the black object that fell on the floor infront of Richard and stayed there in apparent 0 gravity?
Amazing 👏
Wow.  They replicated what Alan Shephard did in 1961.  How incredible.
Look at all the spit droplets floating through the cabin
Cadê os terraplanistas agora?
What's up with all those bubbles in space? 🤔
Richard Branson - tax exile in Caribbean. Richard Branson uses space trip as tax write off (tax avoidance). Richard Branson sued NHS (Tax payers ) Richard Branson went cap in hand to government (tax payers) to save Virgin Atlantic during pandemic as he said he couldn't afford to pay them.  Richard Branson bailed on train franchise before the end of contract after shaming others who did the same and the tax payer bailed out the contract.   Richard Branson went after Jeremy Corbyn when he mentioned nationalising railways yet his company bailed on their north eastern rail franchise which led to it having to be nationalized. We see people cancelled all over the place for speaking out yet a guy like this is still considered some sort of national treasure?? I don't believe in cancel culture but surely branson should be top of the list.
Welcome to space, more like low level orbit, still looked like an amazing ride.
FAKE, FAKE, FAKE
Nice little hobby for the elite. Why not do something useful with your money.
Flat earth ... where are those stupid .
Its a shame RACISM prevented you people from adding a qualified Black person
What a waste of money!
Can I bring my dog?
now we fucked up earth, lets trash space
1:44 Bradley cooper??
Don't let anyone tell you this wasn't an accomplishment. 🔥🔥🔥
Its a great FAKE
This has to be one of the most coolest things ive seen. I think its smart to start in the upper atmosphere, less fuel used that moving from the ground. I look forward to the future!
Cadê os terraplanistas !
That it so insane :)  short but unique experience oh by the way you do not want to pull the window off
Y no le creían al gran don Carlos Saúl
I Wish All Will Land Safely....❤️🙏
what an incredible time to be alive
Look its great we are all one step closer to exploring space, but let me give you a 2122 warning...stay the fk away from LV-426
All y’all trippin off the koolaid, how do you believe this is real?🤯
What an unbelievable waste of resources.  Completely tone deaf.
Flatearthers: "That's a fake planet... 😌"
Money can buy all sorts of things.
Unnecessary risking your life
Fake HÁ HÁ HÁ HÁ HÁ HÁ
1:04 'to all you hungry kids down there, this is what i spend my money on, instead of paying taxes and setting up schemes to feed hungry children. but rest assured when delta variant of the coronavirus shuts down the world again i'll be there with my billionaire socialist hat on expecting rona handouts for the second time, signed a. grifter'
Well I just hope he takes some of the money that he makes taking millionaires into space with them giant Rockets to help climate change
Mister Branson is a miserable man. Is that all he can bring to humanity ? What a pity !
Joss gandoz
Is he wearing a parachute ? lol
So fake. Look at the faces of the other passengers. Such bad actors🤣 Just a plane at a certain altitude who's going down so here's the 0 gravity effect. More than "space" I would call it balloon altitude. Fake as Nasa.
.nice editing nasa 😡😡😡
Ohh unbelievable,  we are only 90 miles above earth, , grow up Branson and STOP  being a PUPPET
“I couldn’t help noticing that I’m considerably richer than yow..”
Not really space, but close @VirginGalactic . They were still 8.5 miles from the Karman Line (actual space) But NASA designated "space" at 50 miles to award astronauts with their "space wings" in the 1950's Great flight though!
just as fake as nasa
FLAT?????
Nah, not buying it. looks incredibly false. Nope.
What movie is dis!?
😂😂😂😂😂CGI & GREEN SCREEN
Might help if they did some science in their joy ride.
They are pretty much doing the same thing that all those zero gravity Jets have been doing for years. I'm not really that impressed.
🛸 Element 115 🛸 🌐 Nikola 369 Tesla 🌐 🌏 Free Energy 🌐 🚀 Virgin 🚀
I already know what I can do.. Im Just waiting for this world to understand and not be afraid...  Congratulations!!!
Awesome but isn't this a glorified vomit comet? I mean the only could float around for a few minutes how's that different than the the plane that's been it for ages?
Великий чел!!! Сделал всех! Респект!!!
Congrats Mr Branson and everyone at Virgin Galactic.  I'm happy for you!
The big guy says, if there's no reentry, they really didn't go to space
History.
That looks like the same aircraft Burt Rutan one the x-prize with. Great job Sir Richard. Great job.
Exorbitant privilege!
flat earthers speechless
Amazing 👏👏👏😍 congratulations 🎊 👍👌🇮🇳
We might as well call you rich man Lazarus. Luke 16:20-24
..INCRÍVEL...ESPETACULAR....
Blasphemy at 3:31  you are so ungodly.
What a ledgend u are Sir Richard Branson 👊 come miles and still going ❤
I still want to see their faces when the rocket fires.
Absolutely brilliant ❗❗ RB,  you are an inspiration for sure 🤘
Just waiting for all the low forehead flat earthers to say it’s fake 😂😂😂😂
Look out your window, people are starving down there! enjoy that minute..
branson is a bell end
The circumstances that allowed Branson to flourish and grow when he was younger no longer exist for most people. And Branson was lucky enough to "borrow" money from Sussex University Student Union funds in England to start his business ventures in the early 1970s.
Why couldn’t we see from these same cameras when it was live? It was just a frozen camera feed when it was live. And why did their hair stop floating before they returned to their seats?
And now finally they see that Earth is flat, but they can't tell, that is not possiple to fly out of the firmanent.
And he tells everyone that they need to be more green 😂
Fake
Meanwhile  jeff bezos is fuming 😡😤. 😄😄😄😁😁
Ya,Ya,Ya,...
I wonder if the shape of the craft helps the weightlessness instead of using green screens.
You can clearly see Earth is flat!
Like I am sorry, but why are so many scientists wasting their time on sending billionaires into space when they could work on making space available for everyone.
What a waste of money , let's go & trash ouster space now we've trashed planet earth. Makes my blood boil
Now just imagine the progress that could be made if these billionaires focused their efforts on earth.
See...earth is flat
Guinea pigs Awesome!
They can only go so far the vanallan radiation belt is to strong to punch through they would disinigrate
Did I miss the tribute or dedication to Michael Alsbury?  Please someone tell me Branson at least mentioned this man who died piloting an earlier prototype?
Il start saving- can’t wait to try it out🙄
That's awesome. Congrats!
this is strange !! no one count how many windows inside ! and count how many windows outside !! look at first shoot for the spaceship  outside  count how many windows !!  and count how many windows inside !!
It looks pathetic
I wonder what the carbon foot print is from all this, just because some spoilt rich bloke wants to play spaceman? I dread to think what horrors are really behind all this as it being done by someone who sued the NHS and his health company paid zero taxes in the UK. Corporate greed and self interest isn't a great look. Don't the news outlets realise that every mention of this spoilt rich guys hobby on the news is giving him millions of pounds worth of free publicity? See it for what it is, greed. 💩👎😒🤔🙄😲😳😯😱🇬🇧.
Zzzzzz
The time when the earth planner cries...
This is the kind of fun you can have from the money saved by avoiding paying your taxes.
Congratulations Mr. Branson!!!
For the next generation of dreamers: Remember to destroy this planet!
Вот это прорыв!
So?..
Pazzesco. 😳
They now offer this trip on Omaze 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 I ask my son if I win would he go with me? He said "sure" causality. That's my boy🤣 Let's go!!!!
Eres farsante nunca saliste  al espacio y como entraste y los lentes la negra se los quita ja ja lo bueno que todo lo haces posible $$$$$
Так что она и вправду круглая?
I love when people think outside the box.  Who says you need the traditional liftoff and rocket to go into space
Como ser amigo dele
This is a joke ! 1960s did this with computers that had less computing power than an old cassio calculator watch and went to the moon and back , not 50 miles into the sky ! Its a billionaire playing with his toys and pretending to be important  !
It's really great that private civilians can get up there, but for now it'll just be for the rich because you ain't going to go on a bartenders salary.
Envy: the front door to communism.
everyone else isnt wearing mask but the pilots do?
I think it's Congratulations?  I just think we're a step closer to fxckxng up another planet. Why can't we just be happy with our awesome planet and make it great? What they've achieved is great but ....
It looks like a Hollywood movie to me, Richard is new Superhero now ❤️❤️
The Russians did it 1961 and the Americans did it next in 1962. I really don't see the the big deal. Oh it cost a million dollars to do it??? 90% of people do not have that kind of money. Oh let me just give a standing ovation to the billionaires who can. 👎
Кто там стучит ?! Откройте уже ему .
If I could afford a ticket I would go.
It's round.
sral pies na sataniste
Underwhelming.
Thought Richard Branson had no money how did he afford his seat
Was the earth flat? Or round!? Lol
Psy ops are getting funnier and funnier these days...
How much it cost? And how did you earn this money???
actors
Fakeeeee
I am also very fond of going to space ❤❤❤🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰
Галя, верни мне мои деньги.
Soooooo nice dear ❤❤❤
Немає нічого дивного, відео погане, бо земля нащадків є Плоска....
Just the amount of fuel wasted for our need for searching another planet to spoil it..  Ouch!!
I know if it was me I'd be like ... Pass me a bag 🤢
There will always be haters.. Unto the end of this world... Sir Branson.. This is such a daring heart you always preached about and now you give us courage to make it... Thanks!
😂😂😂😂
And that was it.. money waisted
Earth is flat! ☺️
save the planet is all you get on sky news  then you get this tosser doing this  for the rich club 60grand for a trip pissoff
So we can't go on holiday or drive a car because of the "environment" but this p3 doo can pollute and do as he pleases ...
It’s all cool and then you realise it’s never gonna be for the common man just elites
Awsome
I'm happy because he's not billionaire son but achieved🙏, I'm a billionaire son but I lost everything 😪
excelente para hacer el delicioso estando alla arriba.
🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
No Pollution ❌
Remind yourself every day, that NOTHING is impossible. 🧡
Yeh us little people are forced to struggle with no heat in winter to reduce greenhouse gases, but hey billionaire douches can cause all the pollution they like with pointless joy flights
🌹✌
porque no se toman selfie  o agarra un celular y filma para abajo?  que cosa no?
30 Sec weightlessness for $250,000. Get your tickets early.
Not quite space but very cool anyway
awesome
They need to be 100km above Earth to be in true space. Nice try though.
Bajeczki dla grzecznych dzieci hehe robia nas w jajko
Shouldn’t the passengers also have oxygen masks etc like the pilots?
Make sure to take a person from the flat earth society next time 😅
It's all in the details  Richard had a hair cut & is wearing brill cream
it's fake video
I was looking out as You was looking in Simple minds
Soon, the scenes we see into Star Wars will become real life!
Soon, the scenes we see into Star Wars will become real life!
I really wanted to see Richard struggle to get back to his seat but it was edited out. Sad
How it must feel to be super rich and bragging, no we plebs will not be able to do this 🤔🤡
Homelessness and hunger VS I wanna be totally self-indulgent....fuk off 😒

Just imagine what Simpsons series can do
What is up with that vid showing the white disc following? Cap or no??
А ФИГЕТЬ !!
Why not show us a better shot of earth 🌍
Я не видел момент взлета я не могу быть на 100% гарантирован, что взлет был именно в этот день. хотя flyradar показывал то что самолёт с рейсом vgx03 и vgx01 вылетали действительно. Но это всё можно сделать! также я видел момент когда показывали в прямой трансляции, когда он только-только отстегнулся и типа в невесомости и резко показывает окно обратно на него и он уже сидит обратно пристёгнутый на месте. То есть, он отстегнулся 2-3сек, показывают окно 2 сек потом снова салон и Ричард уже сидит пристёгнутый... Страно
А у нас бля в России газ в не которых регионах провести не могут🤦🏻‍♂️
I think It is going to take only 10 more years when we travel from one part of the world to another in just 10 to 5 minutes Maybe for example of India to America in just 5 minutes
And people think that the earth is flat. And Noone can go into space how sad
🇺🇸
Went to the moon a dozen times in the sixties.  Played golf on it ! Rode A dune buggy on it. And almost 60 years later haven’t been back, IF this were to be impressive they would have at least circled the moon 🌝 once.
“Space” flight. Lol
You have to see Russell Brants take on this... Yep! He nailed it..
Why did he bother coming back??
Fake jaja
U did it guys,,,new record in ur hands now,,,🤜🤛cheers guys ❣️
I always wondered what happens to the tax money used to bailout suckers...
1:16  this is not a perfect weld , maybe it is  a  glue  ?  Although    Mission Success   Great Work has been  done for humanity.
Check mate, Flat Earthers.
Sub-orbital is not 'Space'.
Fake show
1 hour hahaha.better 0,30 hour and 0,30 hour with sex
Now for all the nay sayers. Once upon a time only the rediculously rich had electricity, running water or indoor toilet due to the expense. If you complain about or try to prevent what the rich have today. you are only begging for a limited future for yourself.
Super cool, and for all you haters it’s his money he can spend it on anything he wants, nobody tells you what to spend that last buck in your pocket on, Congratulations to Virgin, truly an amazing accomplishment.👍👍
Чувствую Я, богачи довыебываются!! И их "Кто-то" накажет!!
Definitely looks like a flat earth! 😆 🤣

They are not in space at all neither are they close to orbit. "This isnt flying its falling with style" - buzz lightyear

No wonder why my phone bill is so expensive. Grrreeat
Obviously a playground for the wealthy, but, pretty darn cool, I must say.
Going to space would be the greatest thing that I could ever do.
Wow!
Devia lá ficar i não voltar mais
To reach that level of success and wealth there is so much hard work behind that..... I know I am not up to the mark, I know we are not up to the mark but let's try to be better and improve to achieve success. Kudos to them🎉🎉🍻
This doesnt show me the curve of the earth camera lenses curve

The man that’s banned beef on virgin flights for environmental reasons. What’s the carbon footprint on this little ego trip
While you're up there please explain to the dumbass flat earthers why the earth IS NOT FLAT!!!
1:45 You can see that the earth is flat! Wake up fools!!!!!
An amazing achievement. The very first aeroplane flights were exploratory and available to just a few. Now they are available to the masses. Hopefully now space flight will follow that same path in the coming decades. Just amazing!
I have always been thrilled with space achievements. Being raise in Cental Florida I really enjoyed the space programs of from the early 80’s on. This is really not an achievement that thrills me, especially when people have already gone further into space and even live in a space station. And like I thought out loud to my wife, while initially watching this on the actual live feed, they didn’t officially go into space . I didn’t even know the exact Karman line altitude (that the rest of the world agrees upon) but knew they were not past it. Just because one US organization deems people astronauts, if they go above 50 miles, does not mean they are in “space”. This was done as a more attainable height for would be astronauts to get their space wings.
Flat earthers have left the chat
What a BS marketing :)))

Yo I'm just here for the comments..
What a waste on money. To this day the main cause of death for children is malnutrition yet here is this idiot spending millions fulfilling his ‘boyhood dream’. This sums up everything that is wrong with our world
What an absolute waste of materials and non-renewable energy. This has no positive outcome what's so ever for us as a dying human race! The earth will soon end up in the same situation and condition as mars once we have burn all of the fuels what we have and destroys out ozone layer from pointless journeys like this! Why don't you spend your money researching and discovering new alternatives to non-renewable energy and ways in which we can look after our planet!!
Toy for Rich kids
And this is the man that wanted extra cash from the UK government because he was struggling to pay the bills!
I don't understand how anyone can believe this. It looks fake as fk
👏👏👏👏👏👏 exilant...
Ridiculous
Thats just fantastic
Wow!! So amazing let's hope one day us normal people will get to go one day 😔😔😔 not all of us have a spare 300k USD
Looks amazing but they couldn't pay me to do it
He is a man!
Waiting for santhosh George 🔥🔥😘🥰
I've watched this several times, it's amazing to watch the emotion and excitement from Richard when he first experiences seeing space and floating freely. He has worked so hard and with such a dedication to this. I think it's brilliant that throughout his business enterprises, ups & downs that he's become so successful and has achieved a childhood dream. But I'm interested to know what others feel about the morality of being such a tough boss throughout his business enterprises, he's achieved his dreams but might have crushed others along the way. Is this right, wrong or not either of these?
Richard Branson: first human to wear shades in space.
He need only simple G-plain to make this expirance. What a waste of money or not?
amazing Virgin 👏
How match?
30 tons of carbon injected into the upper atmosphere for 4 minutes of freefall. That's all I can see.
Imagine if somebody farted...🙄
We should send all the super rich ego maniacs up there and leave them
Such a nice moment... I want to do It some day before i die.
Virgins in space
25000 thousand  people died of hunger in the last 24 hours, including 8000 children, but of course, spending hundreds of millions for a shoot of Adrenaline to  a few spoiled and priviledged brats is an absolute priority. Appaling lack of consciousness.

There's still people who believe earth is flat..🤣
Allahu Akbar,even Muhammad rode a flying donkey and reached space and the 7 heavens ❤️❤️❤️
So…am just wondering what are the contingencies if anything were to go horribly wrong???  Just saying.
Great achievement.  Does anyone know the velocity this craft is moving at?  New York to London in 8min! Auckland to Dohar in 21min Sydney to LA in 18mim
Santhosh George kulangara ❤️
Is Branson wearing a parachute?
🥱
That's what happens when you don't have to pay taxes.

Congratulations to the whole team and waiting to see Santhosh George's journey. Virgin rocks ❤️
the first thing i will do if i going to space is trying moonwalking
Amazing sight and achievement, however the people who paid for this to happen ( virgin customers) can’t get on a virgin Atlantic plane and fly to USA🤔
Well done Richard, now let’s work on sorting out your internet provider it keeps going down.
Bet it’s still a cheaper ride than UK trains.
2:50 Sirisha Bandla ❤️
Meanwhile thousands of people die of thirsty.
Boy...I thought they would of done a better job faking this. Guess they really don't have to seeing as people can't see the obvious cuts, hair spray and bubbles. Sad to see
Oh no no all these  gases and fumes.He should wait until  engineer wihich knows everything about anything invent electric rocket and launch him in much greenier way.Or at least bore tunnel to the moon.
Awesome. Imagine how much further it could fly if Virgin got that bailout money from tax payers all over the world!
This is obviously fake LOL
This is near the edge of space-not spacy-technically speaking
Can we see entire uninterrupted footage from take off to landing?
Selfish idiot flying in space when he's took millions of virgin customers and can't fly them on holiday

Billions of dollars and no one can afford to film the entire thing in one shot With out cuts. Every poor sap films every aspect of their life no one cares about. But nope not going into space. Will post pictures of the food later. 🙈

Branson prepared a little speech that absolutely nobody on board gave a single f**k about. lol
Neat. This spacecraft can probably dock with the ISS
I couldn't help but smile watching that.
Oh to have money.
First step into a game changer in world travel. It is awesome and fun to see.
Save the world from what's going on at the moment..than going to an amusement park for a ride and back

Yep... Earth still looks flat to me. 😁😎
I dont have money for this trip ..só I better look out for an VR flight simulator
Fake
On this expensive flight there is no meal included?!
They have their NASA swimming pool bubbles going everywhere.
The flight is too short. It’s going to be hard to make a profit at 200-400k per ticket. There are only so many people who can afford this.
Richard Branson is criminal.  The US military is killing children and women in Yemen.
@2:16 Sir... please.... please don't pull on the window seal.
1:43 See look everyone, the Earth is a globe! Oops wait a sec, with that reverse curvature I guess the Earth is a hollow tube.  Nope sorry, just the camera or curved glass.
But i always think our Planet is not Round  🤔
What is total trip time?
I just have a question about how does the shuttle protects it's belly to the extreme heat while entering the athmosphere? I couldn't see any heat protector on the shuttle. As usual black ceramic tiles almost on the whole space craft's body.
This guys is giving an inspirational message to all  The people on the back:
I hope no body ate a lot of hot sauce and Taco Bell, be heck of a thing having this butt gravy, in zero gravity hovering above your head, not away you want to show flat earth people the globe model is accurate.
In the future, hundreds of years from now. Billionaires will pay millions to experience life us normal people take for granted every day. Food,'plants,  animals, the wife routine will be extinct. Embrace it while you can ppl. Take it all in. Just look at the wonder's around you.
Lol...spaceship XD
Why they don't show us how they enter the earth ? Because it's the hardest mission ! Why ?
Look they even put chemtrails on the space ships.
Amazing!!
Это есть конченые люди Америки💁‍♂️.
I think they forced Ashton Kutcher to give his ticket to the black chick or there wouldn't be enough diversity.
He did not went to space. In order to reach the "space" they have to pass a certain altitude level considered, as the earth have many different altitude levels before reaching the space. In my opinion the media did manipulate the information, who know why, maybe for their interests or status.
Pay 200,000 for this??
Now all of a sudden, 55 miles up is "SPACE". Devoid of atmosphere and 'gravity'. These jackasses really think we're all stupid! What happened to 'gravity'?
It is fake. The bicyle ride was fake.

This is some heavy dystopian inequality
Space is boring, why would anyone go there...
Well Done!
Is it Richard Branson on board?
Bs
They're saying, this is our earth 🌍 which is fucked up
You ain’t on space …
Flat earthers somewhere like "it's still looks kinda flat"
Futuro y Evolución, impresionante!
thats it? Spend millions of dollars for only this? The look of the sky from earth is much beautiful than the look of earth from space. Millions of people die of hunger and this guy is happy he went for few minutes In space
But they're still in the upper atmosphere.......
I can’t imagine being like that while on marijuana
Wow, they went to the edge of space! Such pioneers. That’s never been done before unless you’re one of hundreds of thousands astronauts in the world. I hope someday they get to orbit around Earth.
Lul it took 18 years of selling $250,000 tickets for a "spaceflight" to make a pretty much straight up flight for a few minutes of micro-G and then straight back down. I hate Musk and I hate Bezos even more but this is not a spaceflight and Branson did not take first place.
😂
And then he burnt a big hole in the ozone layer...Kids!😃
Fake. The book on the pilots' lap was not floating, you can see the chromaqui bugging some windows.
I wish he'd of invested his time and efforts with such exploits in the UK, his own country rather than taking all the jobs and opportunities to the US as they usually do. Instead the UK tax payer is currently paying his UK workforce wages through furlough whilst he wastes millions going into space like the old man from Prometheus. None the less what an achievement.
What a d**k
Mr. Branson,  If you ever schedule a charity flight, please pencil me in.    Congratulations!  😉
So flat earthers explain??!!
I love space, but given the issues on earth now this just seems like a bunch of spoilt rich kids adding to global warming.
Crude not crewed
This looks terrible
Some truths: 1) It wasn't that amazing. Just weightlessness that you can get on a rollercoaster and the curvature of the Earth which you could get on Concorde.   2) Richard was pulling at the window rubber to examine its quality. Typical hands on billionaire.   3) Not worth the money for 2 minutes. I'd rather spend it on the poor.
Waiting for someone to say the earth is flat😂😂😂😂
The Kármán line, an altitude of 100 km (62 mi) above sea level, is conventionally used as the start of outer space in space treaties and for aerospace records keeping. The framework for international space law was established by the Outer Space Treaty, which entered into force on 10 October 1967.
and then it drifted off into the sun and burned everyone alive
He looks like a fucking boss!
Just imagine if he (Elon and Jeff) paid taxes, what we could do! Better education, hospitals, affordable housing etc...
This is how the Dream looks like!
Although the European space agency says he didn't get high enough
He went to space for a whole 1 and a half mins.
I have seen comments that is is all  Fake.  Who cares if it is just enjoy it or dont watch it.
Looks pretty flat to me
In Jamaica when the bus is full, the conductor puts up a cross seat to take more passengers….I will take the cross seat….I’m just saying….
This house you waste your money when people suffering here for food and everything else you're wasting money all that s*** you f****** assholes
if you think the earth is so beautiful, what are you doing up there?
Uau só não sei aonde foi parar as estrelas 🤔🤣🤣🤣
Is this environment friendly?
He has got rid of 3500 jobs since the pandemic and asked the British taxpayer to bail him out 1.2 billion... yet he still has enough money for his little (ego) space project..
Uhummm... WHO filmed outside? Gandalf? Fake CGI! Earth is flat!
Look at  200 years ago  before automobile and now, pretry big leap in that amount of time.
Wauw amazing achievement! I all recommend you to read his book: Like a virgin. It basically tells you his life story how he went from nothing to being a billionare and all obstacles he had to overcome to achieve such goals. Very inspiring!
Who dislike this video!!!
Looks amazing but not sure it’s the right time to be flexing this while my tax money is paying for his furloughed staff
Fish eye lens, ( ) Earth still flat
I’d like to know at what altitude the sky turns black.
where's our bf3 tournament
The earth is flat smh.
It's more of a publicity stunt to promote Virgin Galactic, hence the public have a chance to travel upto the Kármán line- of course there is that price ....... As for the tech involved, yes it's high tech, but nothing new.
fake
This is more like a space vehicle. Who wants stupid Flash Gordon rockets? We need vehicles that can leave the atmosphere and return to land on their own power.
Please remember who designed this. Burt rutan
20000000 million de dollars pour 5minute de plaisanterie !!! et en 5 minute dans le monde 30 personne meurt de faim !!!! l humanité a l air de connaitre sa priorité !!!
Cheers to the billionaires. Hopefully we (the western world) make many more and stop making Marxist decisions that hold all of us back.
Any flat earth believers in the comment section? 🤣🤣🤣
Because yeah who cares about climate chage or global warming 🤦‍♂️
sun is pretty close to tghem hugh, babilonia knew the secrets of the skyes and only stars, no planets folks, dont be fooled
Sorry!!!!!..I do not beleve this is real....
No hay nada como tener dinero...
It wasn’t long ago Branson was claiming poverty and trying to claim furlough and the following year is chartering flights to space

Freefall in closed enviroment.
Wow..diveplanes... under-2min..haha..
They all look slightly terrified. lol
Nothing special here airbus also has these vertical drop flights where you can float around this isn't space though. If the science they teach is real you can't go to space since its a vacuum there is no air to push against 😄😄😄
When i'm right you've reach about 280000 feet. Is it possible to reach the Karman Line (330,000 feet) with this ship in a slightly different configuration?
For some reason the entire time I heard about this I thought they were going to land on the moon. I guess i wasn't expecting them to just fly out to space and come right back.
I saw a CURVE.... Just saying.
What's cool is, everyone has a parachute. I'm with it
Space force is going to be a rescue team first. Search and recovery for ships that go just a little too far
We can already achieve this even more....when we dream.
wow billionaires have fun for your taxes...amazing!!!!! woooow!!!

How was the trip to Mexico, was it the same studio the moon landing was filmed in?
Fake, fake and um fake. There descending quickly thats how there floating. Dont trust these ppl!! Sillyness.
So why did the stock prices tank so hard? 🤔
All that cash spent to look at a dying world
Well done Mr Branson, if your looking for somewhere to throw a bit of money away, send some to me pal 500k would do it mate. Not looking to be a millionair or anything but I could pay my mortgage off with that and not have to work 60-70 hours every week. Just a heads up if your ever in Wales 👍😉
The camera man out on the wing must be able to hold his breath for ages
imagine how many people he couldve raised from poverty
Well I hope it goes well for you rich people.
Distasteful and disrespectful towards all the people who lost so much during the pandemic while people like Branson got even more rich. If they would treat their employees right and would be taxed fair and properly we probably could stop hunger worldwide and maybe even prevent climate catastrophy.
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Explotadores, mafiosos, ladrones quemando de forma obscena millones de dolares robados a trabajadores, en un absurdo viaje a ninguna parte.
Hey how about helping 3rd world countries with that money
Как говорил К. С. Станиславский   В.И. Немировичу-Данченко : "Не верю!"
Look mum, NO wires!!!! This is what real weightlessness looks like NASA!!!!!!! Watch & weep
I wonder how much pollution this causes. And them people be like WHY is climate change so bad lol WE ARE KILLING THIS PLANET SO FAST IS NOT FUNNY.
I’ll bet as soon as the Egyptian’s discovered space travel they went extinct
Richard Bransons networth just went up..
This is gay
Congratulations! I’m really happy to see so much progress.
It's not Space flight 🛫 and it's not the first Did he even get out of is chat
I"ll hit the like button as soon as he figures out how to home vets
Pure bullsh*t privatization and commercialization of space.  Thr glory days of Apollo and Gemini with Armstrong and John Glenn replaced by rocket trips with Bozos of Amazon and Branson of busted cherry Virgin.
as cool as this is, and  as much as I wish I could afford it, they do not have much room to float around, imagine when it has all 7 passengers onboard. not sure it is worth it.
Why are only the pilots wearing masks ! & why is there no social distancing.🙄 I suppose if your in space you can’t transmit anything. Waiting for the Space variant  Absolute joke,
Oh the earth is not flat
Kd os terra planista
No one is a Billionaire
Amount on this spent could have solved half the hunger problem in world, Great achievement tho!
The spaceship went up... the stock crashed down to earth
What was cost I guess 10M $ per passenger
Never give up on your dreams.
It’s amazing what you can afford to do when you avoid paying tax on a global basis! I’m only jealous 🤓
Just a high altitude Zero G plane ... nothing more 😂
Nice concave Earth there 👍😂
Flat earthers will still swear....lol smh
Watching this live was incredible. Almost a tear down the cheek to be honest. Every living human being is capable of doing great things. That's what greatness is all about.  Tap into it!
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
nice movie, very sad that it never happened.
Nice colours black white but yeĺlow i missed something i must watch again.
Imo,a complete and total waste of resources...feed the starving, house the homeless, help heal this broken world.
Wow, useful as diarrhea...
Must have bought it with all that money he got from dodging UK tax and suing the NHS
Look at the flat earth...
Cool, but it wasn't technically space right?
They cut out the part where he said weeeeeeeeeeeee
it was money got u so far, the retail army…
Space ???? Just looked high up
I paid for this with printed GBP. 1971 and beyond=pay for billionaires to have more cash through money printing
Hahahaha low earth orbit is hardly space hahaha
Unbelievable! 😄
Funded by NHS money he sued for....
Hit me up with a seat when Southwest Airlines gets a shot at space!
Are there bubbles in space 0:40-0:44 and 1:14- 1:17 😅
fake alert. bubbles in the water at 40 , 56, and 1:14.  houston we have a problem.  we now have flat earthers, round earthers, and concave earthers.  have fun guys. everything space is "you've been duped'
Después de todo la tierra si es redonda 🙇🏿‍♂️
I feel more admiration for the pilots
I dream that we dont have liars like Hancock in the government. But we do.
Escaping all the pulls of the world Into the void must be a relief ,words can't explain. ❤️❤️
How come I don't see any stars?
🤣🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
depending on who's definition of where space begins, they either were or were not in space. Technically they were not in space, hence no re-entry resistant fuselage materials are needed. They just go really high and fall for a while
BS. Suckers
That cant be earth !!! earth is flat !! errrrrrrrrrrrrrrr no it aint :)
Edited and all fake
Pity it came back.
That will be funny if he looked out and seen Elon on is Tesla...
"Just imagine what you could do".....well first I need to get/make a billion dollars in fucked up America. Don't forget it's different for alot of people. You did this because you're a billionaire, instead of helping the homeless or doing something more productive, you chose to go to space for 20 minutes which didn't help anyone. 🤷🏾‍♂️
Anyone know anything about the backpacks that they're wearing? The configuration of the harness straps is the same as you would see on a parachute
But this ride is much smoother of course and maybe economically viable if incidents are avoided.
Just remember kids you helped him pay for it!
To be honest he doesnt understand about space travel and not even about the spaceship engineering, the only thing he do is funding the cost because he is rich, capital is power. Hire smart people, bring them together, and when something is achieved all glory went to the owner. All of this is only possible because of his employees. The same can be said to jeff bezos, having massive amount of capital (power), hire smart people, bring them together, achieve something, collect trophy repeat.
The Americans did basically the same 60 years ago with a X-15 hanging on a B-52 platform, granted only with one man but at Mach 6.
Rich get richer Elysium movie is the future of this true world beware
that's it?? 250k...for this???loool
Is that REALLY space though?  No doubt they are very high up, but it seems to me that this is just a high altitude “vomit comet” ride. A very over priced one at that.
Keep flying off into the Abyss please.
Doesn't look very flat 😂
Look how FLAT the earth is. (Inside camera)
Nah sorry rich that speech didn’t hit…
Bunch of idiots ruining the atmosphere so they can float around in a tin can
The rich get rich and the poor get poor.
Как же я рад за них)
For being so woke They sure do not have any diverisy hires on that rocket. That some racist stuff. All white. What is it. Richard Branson does not trust people of color to fly him?
Sirisha
I hope they are all flat earthers! XD
Please invite people who have faith that Earth is FLAT. Lol
So there goes my pension money after retirement 😄
People actually buy it omg.. zero g plane like always for 1 minute and people bought it ..space is fake
Earth is flat now proven 🤪
Well done Sir!
Media is fake Government is fake our so called celebrity are a bunch of fakes………believe what u want to believe but we know that this is staged………the world is a stage……oh and also they still haven’t been to the moon
"Spaceflight" .... 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤦‍♂️
Oblivion
Ancient technology is all this is long trail of fire blasting out the end of this craft or whatever you call this thing.  Its no more than the X 15 being dropped from a aircraft in the 1960 s flown by Neil Armstrong.  It seems that is this the best that can done  in 2021 ? We had comic books as kids in the 1950 s & 60 s of rocket ships with fire blasting out the end of the ship there should be craft more advanced than that maybe anti gravity faster than light speed capabilities liquid fuel , explosive dangerous I'm not impressed maybe you young people are but not me . Also i have to remember our Government is keeping all this technology to themselves.
The skeptic in me is skeptical about crew members not wearing any sun glasses at all times.  It takes a fraction of a second to go blind at that altitude.
Nice job. How long before we all get to go?
New lies ,the earth is flat
Like don't pay your Virgin Atlantic Staff....
richard looks like he suffer
Well it proves to the earth flatters. Earth is not flat🤣🤣
It need handless on the inside
Hope he stays up there
This why he asked for a government bailout..excellent news sure all the sacked staff will be delighted with this
6,542 satellites in space and couldn't even see 1. Why can't they ever zoom out so we can see more of the earth? My phone zooms out more than that.
Wow to see richard branson!
Everyone onboard "weeeeeeeeee"       Me:  Where the heck is my Dramamine!
History!! super cool. sure you could have fed the hungry, but, they'd be hungry again in a day. space is important for invention, medicine, the future.
Where are the stars and other celestial objects?
Proper fake 👌 lovely air bubbles in space 😉
The firmament almost looks black at that height.
Well that looks like a lot of fun the average Joe will never experience....
We need a longer cargo to do the Superman fly inside  😍😍😍
Branson saying looking down to our beautiful beautiful earth, that his planes have been polluting the air of for years!!
Amazing..   How much this in 2021 ?? How much this 2031 ??  How much this 2041 ??  How much this 2051 ??  How much this 2061 ??  How much this 2071 ??  How much this 2081 ??  How much this 2091 ??  How much this 2101 ??  I hope people in the future will respond to this comment and reflect on how much we've evolved over time ! See ya ..
Our beautiful beautiful earth......the one you have just help ruin!!!!!
Bu bu flAtZ eArThZzzz!
It’s not the fall that kills you, it’s the sudden stop at the end.
Thank you so much Mr. Branson. Dreamers have ALWAYS paved the way to bigger and better things for humanity.  What you achieved today is understood by only a few.  It will be admired for generations to come.  Again, I thank you!
Could of fed alot of people or helped with debt for families in Africa.   It's refreshing no one gives a single toss about this. 🤠
The sheer joy on their faces! Beautiful.
Yeah great,  you just Fart around in space wasting millions on a tin can and rocket fuel, while the rest of humanity is ravaged by death, floods homelessness murder rape famine, and all you can say is boys & girls look at the dream I had. Nice one mr Branston pickle.  Just what the world needs is Billionaires Bumming around in Space.
The earth is flat
Richard Branson is an alien!❤🙌
It will cost £250.000 for one of us to go up so that counts me out lol 😆
BS
What about climate change? Pollution… or monea does not pollute…
Trop fort les effets speciaux ! Et ils ont meme reussi à rajouter une courbure à la terre car, tout le monde le sais bien : La terre est plate !! looooooool Avec plus de serieux, félicitations c'est un beau vol !
They never left lower earth orbit just like nasa deceivers. There is no space
This is fucken awesome insane dream come true for Richard
🇮🇳
I get it what a trip..3 mins of space.....curious as to what that all cost. lol
What are those “bits” flying past the aircraft that can be seen on the outside camera?
If you believe this real please take two shots of boiling water
JESUS SAVES
Can't wait to watch this on Safari Channel... SGK
That’s badass
Being BILLIONAIRES, you can FINISH ALL YOUR BUCKETLIST in your LIFETIME
25 million dollars, 1 minute floating. I just calculated the amount of money that costs airplane free fall experience and 25 millions is equal to 5 years free falling.
Why did it take Richard Branson so long to unstrap? That's one of the first things I would have done
1:43 imagine the curve is upside down XD      earth is flat
They sell it as if going 80km up the sky meant there was no gravity anymore, but gravity up there is just the same as it is down here. Besides the stunning views of the Earth, everything they're doing can be achieved on Earth.
I can see why the stock went down.... People today seek high adrenaline  experiences.
Healthcare please
250.000 USD/ ticket. It is nothing for a billionaire.
Better done at night time. Stars.
Mind Leads and Body Follow.  Perfect Example not to Give Up
This plane like spaceship design looks like it makes more sense than Elon's space rockets... Can anyone enlighten me on why the rocket design to begin with?.
Dentures nearly came out of that one
The whole world has known Sir Richard Branson
2:17 : At first, i believed he wanted to open the window.. It wouldn't have made sense if that was the case.. 😂
for what a space u speak? when 100 km up is space??? when u go on mars, neptun, jupiter, then,  for now u can say that your plane fly a bit higher than other
Biggest middle finger ever . They ridiculed. Laughed. Thought he was mad and what not. Thats how u advance humanity people.
They should have sent the flat earthers up there.
Ticket !!! Ticket !!! Please 🥸
Earth is flat, this is so fake
branson is the biggest numbnut on the planet.. his riches blind him to the reality of the rest of the 99.9% of the world, comments like ''if we can do this (as he floats around in a private spaceship) imagine what you can do'' proves this
Where is the re entery video
What a dream to come true. Wish I was apart of it.
After this success, channel's s subscribers grows fast😃😃😃
why the pilots using oxygen and the passengers are not?
Meh….now do something useful!!!
So Fake 😂
Just to let you know 99.9% of human beings will never get ride in one of these. Just for the oil & gas shiekhs tech moguls and billionaire/ millionaire club memebers.
To point out the disparity: this flight cost the same as three Starships.
I love/share the space ambition part in these sort of ventures but I hate their hypocrisy about sustainability and environmental concerns. If you start to scale up space tourism I’m afraid we need to really leave earth for another planet…
The loudest "F..k" came from Bezo
sranie w banie
just went through the comments. i can't believe how many insane people there are. flat earthers, conspiracy theorists, killjoys. i don't care what defines space. 80miles, 100miles, 1000miles. i don't care.  i'd still love to be able to go.
Nice CGI 🤣🤣
The edge of spcace
What’s with the bubbles? Inside cabin and outside
From space to about to land in one cut of the camera!😂😂😂🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Nobody needs that!! This is nothing what fits to our modern life today! Everybody is talking about CO2 footprint and the US president announced the protection of our environment as a core strategy. There should be a difference between the need of a car to feed your family or just burning our resources for fun! I see already the so-called celebrities who are talking about sustainability and what everybody has to do now and then in the next second they do things like this. It is just because as long I talk about others I am fine but if I need to follow restrictions I don’t accept! That is why I believe you should think twice and START WITH YOUR OWN CO2 footprint first.
Gonna be a tough pill for flat earth believers to swallow when they actually go up and see it for themselves
Are they going to space jump with those parachutes they are wearing? Lol
He just wanted the best view looking down on the minions. All heil the Space Wanker!
за ваши миллионы любой каприз,  не простые люди туда полетели да и суборбитальный полет это еще не космос а верхние слои атмосферы земли, так как если бы они попали в сам космос то по возвращению их корабль просто сгорел в атмосфере
2:16 what does he think he was doing???
that speech was cringeworthy
Certo che notizia interessante..tanto quanto quello che succede sulla Terra. Questi egoisti spaziali investissero mai i loro fottuti miliardi  nella ricerca medica o scientifica..macché. Sono bambini viziati egocentrici paranoici pieni di soldi. Magari si perdessero nello spazio, lui Bezos e gli stronzi come loro. Sarebbe la giusta punizione per la loro arroganza e non comunicazione con il resto del Mondo, neanche fossero gli Dei olimpici.
we need the president of the flat earthers Association up there on the next ride
The stars??
All that money and they can only afford 1080p...
A Indian in this crew
Californication
I hope they were flat earthers.
That’s a pretty round… flat earth 😭
Impresionante!
The rocket fuel is made from pure flat earthers and environmentalists
soo Satanic.
Id justify it if it had a purpose like launching a satelite or dropping people off at a space station but this is just another expensive joyride, and given the possibility of Green house emissions and waste of finite resources where does this rank?
Amusement for really rich people
Dumbest sounding apes I've witnessed
I am forever grateful to Dr IGUDIA on YouTube who cured me from herpes with his herbal medication, you are so real and trusted.
Fateci fare un giro ai terrapiattisti
I wonder what excuse the flat earthers will have now
Ummmm they didnt actually go into space
Richard Branson -  requested a 1.2 billion pound bail out from government. Sued the NHS for 80 million because they lost a contract to provide children health services. Humans already went to space like 60 plus years ago. Thank you Richard I am so very inspired 🙏 ✨ 🙌
So so cool to spend so much money for a few minutes of fun, when you think at least 50% of humanity down there are suffering like hell.
Lucky peoples
half of the population dont get food atleast reduce the number not saying innovation must not be done but the numbers are way to high.
Bruh Branson was supposed to get those cool helmets n oxygen masks those pilots are wearing.
It's fake. Windows are tv screens. The earth is flat.
Flat. I knew it.
What was the ticket price?
How about Branson spends his money on ways to improve the environment of this planet, rather than polluting it more with rocket fuel going in the atmosphere whilst visiting others!
This is just for the billionaires not us regular people, man has been going to space for years this is not out the ordinary, it just marketing for billionaires.
It's so amazing! But how much it's cost?
He's not even enjoying the moment. It's all a PR stunt. Pathetic. All the others are rolling around in absolute joy.
Look flat earther's....... It's round!
Anybody can tell what is a backpackers all passenger had? Because I don't think so it's  parachute!!!
Not worth the effort or risk for a few mins
So zero g plane really. We did something like this  supposedly 60 years ago. It doesn't add up 🤔
Well done, greetings from Russia.
Branson has always been that billionaire who’s super cool.
Amazon: Prime members be ready to click the unlike button Virgin: Yeah you can do this...
He can put himself into space but couldn't run a f**cking train line
Isn't sunlight radiation much more dangerous out there for sightseeing through those windows?
So for the right amount of money i can take my girl into space and 0 gravity plow her? What a time to be alive.they say there is nothing new under the sun...except for my space sex ambition
Wishing You All A Very Safe & Successful Voyage to OuterSpace & InterPlanetary World, Cheers 👍🏼🙏👌🎉✌️✊💐🥳🤩 🤴👸
Just wondering how much of the weightlessness experienced was due to a parabolic flight trajectory versus actual zero gravity ?  Any one know?
Fake
But it’s not an actual space flight ;)
🥱🥱🥱🥱
They only went to 45000 feet the u2 spy plane flys at 70000 so get back to me when the fly higher  than a U2 this over hyped propaganda
Flat earth
All I can hear him saying is "to all you flat earthers out there, suck on this"
Looks like bs, publicity stunt to me.dare to say we'll made fake
Fake
what was the one astronaut holding/pumping? seemed like a ball air pump or so...with a thingy around her leg. and were they really testing the seals? did look like it haha, or used them as handles :P
🇮🇳
This is Really Amazing!!!!! That's why  like a Mastermind Investor I'm definitely going to Invest in this Great Company: Virgin Galactic. All In. 💸🤑💸🤑🚀🤑🚀🏦😎👍
To bad accounting to top scientists its not in space. Lol
What happened to saving the Planet??  Pumping more carbon to the atmosphere
Why is he floating but the person behind him isnt could it be wires the masa trick
One of rich people bucket list. Count me in if I will become rich one day. 😂😂😂
Fantastic achievement "We are such stuff As dreams are made on" William Shakespeare, The Tempest.
300k usd just to experience zero gravity
NOT A SPACE FLIGHT! SUB - ORBITAL!  The ISS is much MUCH higher and still not in space. What you did was done in the 2960s. Your only goal is to take the money of the rich. HA HA!
I can’t for the registrar for the game of 2 tickets to space. My country Ukraine is not on the list of countries. Why?
Amazing
Me -I was thinking we try to  reduce the carbon     Virgin -we pretended to reduce the carbon
How much would it cost me to go into Space??
"A funny thing happened on the way to the Moon..."
Looks like a zero g aeroplane
But i can't have a plastic straw because of climate change lol....these rich folk huh
Negative comments and dislikes are   are being removed
Pretty fancy Zero - G aircraft!
Didn't they do this already decades ago?
He had better let a flat earther go up there for free and film it
" Dear Customer  Unfortunately because COVID-19 we need to increase your price for your tv and brodband and phone"   🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
👀
that expensive and we can't even get 4k on here? 😅
Nice, but does it useful, safe, ecological ?
Waste of lot of money.
Somehow i don't really see this as a spaceflight . Gagarin was doing this 60 years ago and he was in real space full weightlessnes and on a real geocircle Trajectory this is a wannabe spaceflight only why do they bother ? 60 years ago already  this was surpassed in many many ways .  what a BS !
Can't wait for it to blow up
And they say we went to the moon lol
Waste of time, money and energy. Unconsciousness and selfishness at its best.
Those windows must be deformed. They are showing that the Earth is curved and not flat. Must be CGI or something.
I wonder what the flat earthers saying about this
Wow.
Not a flat earther but it looks kinda flat in this video 😐
"Spaceflight" Lol what a joke they are falling towards earth that's why they had to get back in their seats before they hit the ground.
❤
I want go to Space!!
0.09 Earth looks flat as a pancake
Bloke was begging for a bailout last year, while kids went hungry. Now he’s playing Star Wars… we need a wealth tax, immediately.
Can we make a crowdfund to bring a flatearther to space pls?
Virgin Galactic claim the environmental impact is around 1280kg per passenger. 8 people plus 2 pilot team so 12800 kg of co2 per flight. Virgin claim this is the same as a business class trans Atlantic flight. I checked this and on a trans Atlantic flight the whole aircraft only produces 90kg of co2 an hour, roughly 10 hours average flight time would be 900kgsof co2 per flight for the whole aircraft. Your math is so bad, I now understand why your passengers need parachutes.
Title: Flying 100kms up into the sky and falling down!!!
I thought voice is not heard in space for the lack of medium to carry the sound.
elon was there 10 years ago😉you don't even know it🥂
and what's next ? you can do the same in 777 and?
В 70 лет на своём космолёте отправиться в суборбитальный полёт - это здорово и круто
Some of the worst filming and editing I've seen in awhile. Pathetic little speech he gave too.
Man earth is flat i am telling you again😅
We don't see the whole globe.... just a half
Que buena película 🎞😂😂😂😂
Fact : He Paid all that money just to fall down.
Great job team! Of course the next logical step, is when are we going to see the first Virgin Galactic hotel?! 🤔😉🤙
Прекрасно! А где Рогозин?
Branson is everything i hate about the rich, he begs the government for bailouts , does little to help his staff through covid,  does not pay uk tax then goes on a space race against the other rich elites ,besos , musk. Why not instead of going on a who can piss the furthest competition , see who can actually help the most people with all that wealth!
he he
It doesn’t look like they saw a lot of beautiful parts of this planet. Mostly red rock, mountains or desert.
Why did he felt the need to ruin this by talking. You’re not inspirational, just very VERY rich.
In a few years this will be available to all middle class citizens. I would love to smoke a doobie in space that would be so trippy
The scary part of boarding spaceship is you’ll never know if it sends you to space or heaven
no thermal insulation for re entry. why???????????? 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
It's Amazing. A simple passenger flight takes you to space, that's the idea. A great achievement to bring that simpleness.  Especially I am very happy that I see an Indian Flag on Shirisha's shoulder. I thank Branson for giving this due credit to the Indian Engineers who absolutely deserve it.
Zero G Plane Be Like;
Path breaking
Congrats to the Virgin Galactic team and all involved in making this happen! This is the future!
Bubbles in space
They admitted parts of the video were Faked
Yeah lets pretend that wasnt a tv studio light
الأرض مسطحة
Crazy
Omg
It's so cool. I want be in space too.
Looks incredibly fake. Poor acting as well.
What a waste of the publics tax dollars! Pay your own way to space!
2:23 Richard was to pull window liner
I am not flat earther but the windows distort the view. I can see concave and  convex of earth. I think fish eyes lense. I hope we don't use that type window.
Sir Richard, congratulations! And would you also PLEASE offer a free ride to some “Flat Earthers” so they will finally shut up about it! Thanks! 😁
Sure looks round to me. Dislike if you're a flat-Earther. Like if you actually have a brain.
"This is just the beginning part of space, we haven't even gotten to OUTER space yet!"  - Oscar Choice (RIP)
Flat earthers will say this is a movie
Flat earthers be like “ those cameras are all fish eye, the windows are all fish eye, the eyes in Branson’s face are special fish eyes lol. Or something about a studio pmsl !
It’s amazing what billionaires can do with a bail out here or there.
F that. Million bucks for few mins of zero G. I would rather pay $15.000 for a Mig29 edge od space package and have the rest for cocaine and hookers
Unbelievable, Congratulations
Very hoax.. The pilot using helmet wit h2⁰.. But the passenger dont have.. Is anybody see stars..? 👀👀👀⭐🌟✨
I do find it interesting that there is not a single passenger reaction shot after main engine start. As a working television producer this would be a must in my edit. I wonder if it tells us much about the stability of the ride?
I can see the earth is flat 😂
Всё хорошо все рады а хера тогда акции упали аааа?
Neil deGrasse Tyson - You didn't go to space but sub-orbital. Atleast you should reached outer orbit.
This 1000% confirms that we MUST tax billionaires a lot more. They will just monetize space flights while the peasants live around crumbling infrastructure.
So is the Earth flat or not????
About as interesting and remarkable as mowing my lawn
I have seen his F1 team ... I'll pass...
So only for the rich ok that’s really fair
The camera angels change every 5 seconds
Looks so fake but whatever.
Proud to be Indian because there I one member who is Indian.
congratulations from Sri Lanka to the luckiest person on the earth...However Someday I am also will fly with my family...
Agora da para ver que a terra é plana...kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
So many red-pills in this comment section, it's hilarious how many idiots you can round up in an intellectually inspiring video...
Why is the crew acting like they've never experienced reduced gravity before? First time in space and they focus on playing with each other? xD Man, my eyes would be glued on Earth ♥
Yeah right
That’s amazing!!!!
So fake
Is Virgin Galactic, Virgin Atlantic and Virgin Orbit the same?
@2:54 left him hanging!
Please let him stay there , one billionaire less , less problem for the 🌎 🌏.
Rip Burt 🙏     Too bad this douchebag will steal your shine post mortem.
One tiny crack and your blood boils  ... 💩
Bye flat-earth, it's been swell..
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👍🏻
Is that really spaceflight or a plane flying really high up?  think that's a marketing gimmick. A true spaceflight will need shielding for reentry and this "plane" clearly didn't have any coz it never left the atmosphere,  so "spaceflight" is a misleading term for this flight, doesn't really matter because most of who's watching this are idiots anyway
Aliens gonna think we're all virgins
Can you imagine what a stooge you would have to be to win yourself a seat on that flight? Imagine putting up with that Branson guy. I would need extra barf bags.
End world hunger? Nah. I want to fly super high.
Amazing moment. Congrats to the team. To Branson.
Tax payer funded toys for the super rich.
Must be nice being rich.
What really caught my attention was that Branson's "mission specialists" seemed more interested in experiencing weightlessness than staring out the windows in stunned, awed silence.  They looked like 6-year-olds rather than adults.  The opportunity of a lifetime within their grasp and they turned it into a "bounce-house" frolic.  Consider this: I'll bet that Alexander the Great would have gladly traded ALL of his conquests for even one moment with that view. I'm sure the floating was fun, but you can do that in your backyard pool every day. Kinda makes me embarrassed for my species.
Ridiculous, the money could be spent for needful things.
amazing! another bunch of millions blown up for nothing....🙃
Fake! ok we can fly high but not into space. Nasa, SpaceX ect ect use nice CGI to fool us.
Fake af they free fell to get weightless!!! They weren't in space it doesn't exist!!! Love the convex windows making the earth look round.  😂😂😂
Money can use for poor people instead of an expensive Galaxy mission.
Have money will travel...congratulations...
Excelente !!! El futuro es ahora. Richard felicitaciones por tantos logros. Larga vida para seguir adelante!
Keep 🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑
that's not real 'space' you've all been fooled.
So spinning and jumping around is first thing you do in low earth orbit! DisneyLandWorld and takes belief to make this real. Amazing show that Hollywood produced at cost of tax payers. And what did this accomplish. Zero
Why it is not flat?
I have noticed  a LOT of leftist hate this..  all they do is complain..    unbelievable.
Dont tell me its just a CGI 😅
WGAF?
All the new camera and  video tech and still the same video framed since the beginning of fake space travel
They aren’t in space. They are free falling inside of a plane. Is all
Let me know if they actually ever make it to space instead of just Earth's atmosphere
He ain't a vigrin no more taking those hoes to space in his whip
How did they get clearance to fly without masks? Super-spreader event according to FAA. /s
Legends tell that once you arrived space as a virgin in a virgin Plane you will transform to a alpha male chad
The lack of money is the main root of the problem,as conclusion anyone could go there if we are Masonic Satan capitalist Money worshippers in meincraft lol
Total crock to keep you confused..where are the helmets to stop the G force from making their heads explode?   No one has EVER broken through the dome or left lower orbit...period.
Meanwhile on Earth a child under 5years of age dies every 6-10 seconds due dirty water or malnutrition. Perhaps the time and effort would've been better spent elsewhere?
Starting early is the best way of getting ahead to build wealth, investing remains a priority the stock market has plenty of opportunities to a decent payout with the right skill and proper understanding of how the market works.
Edge of space. It’s a huge difference
Richard Branson is a collossal melon.
"Elysium"
Wowwwwwwww!!!! Blessings with eyes to the skies!!!
from space . com :  "The thermosphere extends from about 56 miles (90 km) to between 310 and 620 miles (500 and 1,000 km). Temperatures can get up to 2,700 degrees F (1,500 C) at this altitude. The thermosphere is considered part of Earth's atmosphere, but air density is so low that most of this layer is what is normally thought of as outer space. In fact, this is where the space shuttles flew and where the International Space Station orbits Earth. This is also the layer where the auroras occur. Charged particles from space collide with atoms and molecules in the thermosphere, exciting them into higher states of energy. The atoms shed this excess energy by emitting photons of light, which we see as the colorful Aurora Borealis and Aurora Australis.  The exosphere, the highest layer, is extremely thin and is where the atmosphere merges into outer space. It is composed of very widely dispersed particles of hydrogen and helium."
Fake hihih
Anything is possible with billions of dollars right?
Mankind is extremely proud. You dont think we'd have full cities and towns with highway network and vehicles and businesses up there by now? It has been almost 70 years. What do you mean "Theres no need to go back?" Governments have plenty of reasons to go back to new lands. Otherwise, they wouldn't have drawn everyone out of their homes the way they did when they took the lands. The first automobile accident was in 1895 and it was between a car and a bicycle crossing an intersection because there was no stoplights and they didn't see each other. 40 years later we had full road networks connecting our cities. Eventually they became highways as our technology advanced. It has been 70 years since we landed on the moon. We should have public transport to the moon by now and covid would've affected that travel. You'd be seeing it everywhere on the news. "People on the moon have to remain quarantined there as people on Earth have been infected with covid19." "There are now rumors of new cases on the moon." "Earth shuts down."  Either we didn't go to the moon and it was political and we have been lies to, Or we went to the moon and figure out we cant land on it, Or we landed, and theres something up there that made even Russia and USA not want to go back.  Let them post a full video of a trip to the moon. We are in 2021 heading into 2022. 2025 is supposed to be a "futuristic year" and we never advanced. We have more clear footage of the ocean than we do of space and yet we supposedly know more about space.  If you feel uncomfortable or targeted or are assuming certain things about me, then theres something up with your ego and with your belief system. There is no need to insult when telling the Truth and if you're feeling offended or like you want to "laugh it off", you're really afraid that you might be wrong and so you project. Dont project on me. Look within and figure it out.
Why not show reentry?
You mean for TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS.!!! We can do it....🤓
Fake AF
Earth is burning and you are polluting stratosphere just for fun...
Such an expensive toy! I am jealous 🙂
At about 56-57 seconds was that space debris flying past?
Hello sir, did you find the earth from there flat or spherical?
Is it just me, or was Richard trying to get out?
Too Kool, lucky guy and his team. Truly an amazing dream come through 🙏🏼
Maravilhoso 👏👏👏👏👏👏
Obraz podczas obracania się statku i widok ziemi i horyzontu i słońca mocno przypomina kadr z filmu Interstellar , albo to wszystko foto montaż  albo prawda.
Earth is flat.
Incredible!!!!! Cant stop watching, absolutelly amazingballs
When you’re a crusty billionaire anything is possible!!
There ain’t nothing in space. They get bored and come back.
Cumplio su sueño y no guardo la plata como otros ricos abaros de mierda , excelente video ctm
Fake
He's not done badly for a kid who started selling records on a market stall in London.
Is virgin airlines just a huge home to fly virgin across the sky?
Hey look. The earth is roundish. Who knew 🤔
Well, but I'm afraid with this device, Galactic will still remain Virgin.
Anything for a buck 🤮🤮🤮🤮
After all the theatrics of a green screen and wires 🙄 not a jot of curvature . Bravo👏
Need better collapsible seats & larger windows 😅 Space tourism is a show, the ship's a stage 👍🏼😁 but the play is too short and 😢😱 freaking expensive 😅
Earth is flat. Nasa invented the fish eye lenses to continue the lies
"Welcome to almost space"
We already done been to space.  This is just wealthy people showing off their money.  This has no importance what so ever.
Wonder how long before we see the first zero-G earth-orbit-space flight orgy? Get on it Brazzers!!
WTF
He was a friend of Jeffrey Epstein and his companys name is virgin.
Waste of time money and energy... How many homes could this expense have paid for?
Wtf is a VIRGIN GALACTIC?
15 or so yrs ago..i saw 1st one at edwards afb in mojave desert...rip brooke
Planes have been flying and simulating zero gravity for many many years. Js
Bunch of Idiots going to nothing
Great achievement! Invite some flat earthers! Let them see 😃
Water bubbles everywhere. Y’all are so gullible
This is something our country SHOULD have celebrated 😃
All I see is the greatest example of self- indulgence ever expressed by an individual (maybe a little bit of jealousy). But this is living under freedom. Go USA.
Hard to believe that everyone on this flight is indeed a virgin. Wow now that is amazing.
Low earth orbit is not considered space.
Inspiring.
I also am a man with a dream of being fabulously wealthy. I'm sorry Richard but this looks like a ride for the very rich, very few and very privileged. The kind of people who can blow £100000 without a thought in order to briefly view the Earth from a place almost nobody else will get to see it from for some time.
Maybe one day I won't have to pay taxes either.
Shame on him. A billionaire with mind of an infant.  Stop playing with rich-boy toys and feed the poor.
Yawn..
notice the non white person there for ballast and to minimize complaints.
Waiting for the day when the first spaceship has an Crash.....
When is space low season? Wanna  book a cheap ticket
Every body is busy with this work and technology but am wondering the creator of the universe that beautiful land is incredible  ☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️
So Amazing, in MSF!
Didn't officially make it into space. Money well spent. 👍
If we could do this,  we could help millions of people instead of pissing about. Get in the real world ffs!
So much money for nothing,some with so much and the rest of the world couldn´t dream or just have something to eat,stupid world he living.
Flat earthers going to say this is fake.
woah
This was utterly FAF
ASTRONAUTS train for years their whole careers to do that and u mean to tell me they can jus handle zero gravity easily no effects lol
A terra é muito grande não deu pra ver a curvatura
"If we can do this, just imagine what you can do!". Yeah..... if only everyone had ridiculously massive amounts of $$$.
After asking the UK government for help for his business in the pandemic he's pissing around like this instead of paying his own staff 😷😷😤😤
I d like to go too but i m skint!
What a tosser!
Круто, я бы тоже так хотел слетать посмотреть на наш шарик и темноту без границ)
Who was his crew?
Amazing  how yhe camera man never gets in the way lol
yo que el me bubiera quitado los lentes para ver bien "el espacio"
We did and then some 60 years ago. Morons now think this is a great achievement
Flat earthers where y’all at? So I guess this was CGI too right 🤦🏾‍♂️🤣🤣
Fake
Greta is going to be pretty mad
Oh ! He started that speech as soon as they reached there. Must have been waiting for years to say this seems. 😂
That’s the most fun he’s had on a plane since he was flying with Epstein on the Lolita Express!!  I used to look up the guy too...how sad...
Ok So is it flat or not
Looks boring once they arrived at “space” 🥱
Looking at this comments and some of you really believe this theatre :)) Idiots !!! Geezee
just here for all the comments from pig trash who do so many great things with their moneys. shout outs to all you earthly heros who find time to count the next man pockets🤣
Just a small doubt! Can sound travel through space??!!!
This is great!
How much are the tickets for that ride?
I am so impressed and happy for what u have achieved, wish I could  do that for a second, congratulations for all of your team and you.
Watching a billionaire floating around in space on a multimillion dollar flight could not be any less relevant to 99.9999999999999% of people including me.
Serious question....what is "this" ? Cuz he ain't in space friends.
“If we can do this-- just imagine what you can do?” I'll just remain here on Earth because I'm broke.
half population: the earth is flat virgin galactic: wanna bet?
Return  And strap in we ain't got  the fuel to stay in the stratosphere any longer lmfao
amazing what's avoiding the corporate tax can do 😊
And, where the flat earthers are now?
This is fake. The earth should be flat, not round. They got it all wrong 🤪
I wonder how many people in your own country you could help out of poverty with the funds spent on your trip.?....
This is epic ngl!

amazing...I love this guy
Space: The Final Frontier
They didn’t show the re entry which is slightly skeptical
Aliens - We all are going to meet soon ✨💯
Simpson had shown a episode about the same event 😍
I’m curious, Can someone explain why the pilots are on oxygen but the passengers aren’t, even though they’re sat right behind them?
Does anyone know how long the passengers actually spent spent time flying in the space? 5 min?
Wow ! Super philanthropic gesture towards humanity ! A true hero of the people ! An inspiration to all ! Overcoming the adversitu of being a child, and growing into an adult ! Brilliant ! He should be nominated for a Nobel peace prize for his huge contribution to the enlightenment , and humanitarian effort he put into this monumental achievement, for the benefit of mankindkind. A true hero , bravely going to space, while courageously turning his back on all naysayers who would derail his ambitious heroism, with rallying cries, of " Feed the hungry ! " or,  " Clothe the naked ! " fearlessly, Sir Richtard Brainsting  pushed forward ! Ultimately achieving single handedly, the most revolutionary, and prolific accomplishment in human history. What an inspiration to us all. Bravo Sir !
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SUPER!!!!!!!!!!!!
Super incredible new era
How about  all the staff you made redundant? It wasn’t too long ago, you were begging the government for hand outs for Virgin Atlantic, the irony of it all.
Imagine spending this kind of money to help the poor and homeless
Спасибо за развитие космоса!
A US Navy pilot in a corrugated garbage can did that in 1961. In 2021, a billionaire rides in his corporate space plane, and people are amazed that it can be done.
OMG this is so Cool 😎 amazing 😉 congrats guys 😎 beautiful so beautiful 😍😍😍
They look like they’ve gone nuts
Looks like nothing more than an updated version of the X-15 program from the early 1960s.
Yeah while you fly around the rest of the world is locked down and starving.. Fuckin stay up there mate!
They should take a Flat Earther with them. Knock some sense in to them. Beautiful!! Love this!!
Branson deffo rehearsed that speech unfortunately it didn’t have the impact of neil Armstrong’s one small step 😂😂😂
Dare to dream!
I would like to go there but I'm not that rich..:))
From bottom of my heart congrats Mr Branson and all that work on the project to put human in space.
oh man, those people are so lucky to be there!...
Egoísmo,decadencia, frivolidad y daño al medio ambiente, de la carrera para la conquista del espacio se deben encargar los países y las organizaciones internacionales y no los millonarios decadentes!!
You can see the ice wall!
He was saying he was skint last year and wanted government handouts. Goes to show he's not being taxed enough
"...and most of all I'd like to thank Mike Oldfield, without whom none of this would have been possible! Thanks for starting me off, Mike!"
Let the UK and Australian Tax Payers bail out my Airlines while i entertain the super rich anything is possable
you are not in space, you still on earth, that's a rip off lol
Fisheye-lens camera. a 3 minute video. another red flag astroNOT video. cheers for yet again confirming spacetravel is nonsense
Don't be deceived.  Trust in (Yeshua) Jesus. and before yall laugh can call me religious, it's not about religion but a relationship! Repent and be saved.
Ridicule et inutile. Voir de haut une planète en perdition: le privilège de quelques milliardaires puérils. Ashamed.
Meanwhile the earth burns, people are in poverty whilst there are more pointless billionaires than ever. Just screw you and your stupid vanity project. Stay in space. They could fix the climate crisis but instead they make stupid rocket ships so their ego can float for 40 seconds. Absolute cretins.
Anyone got a shot of £1000000 please
0ne quick way to destroy the EVERYPERSON ionosphere for the pleasure of a few rich Totally worth it people, cheers mate
TAX THE RICH
Why don't you use your money and scientific team to actually help the world and not destroy with with all the pollution your ships are generating all for financial gain for yourself. I would travel in one of your ships if you paid me
Greta: How dare you!
Wish I could do that!
The Earth is Flat Baby ... Thats Kindergarten 😎 Greets from Deutschland
Finally VS reached to Space. Congratulations VS Team, Proud moment.
Why doesn't this need heat shield like the Space shuttle orbiter?
Eddie Bravo: "Fish eye lens bro? Come on..."
Please fly up all of California , New York and Chicago and open the door and makes us everyday hard working people dreams come true 😉..
"So virgin galatic  is not a virgin anymore " Rename:Chad galactic
The flat-earthers are not going to like this video..
I'm not sure what's more incredible, the average human monkey just floating around in space or re-entering earth's atmosphere like it was just a morning piss
The Karman Line defines space at 62 miles above mean sea level.
The word Impossible itself says I'm-possible
I always believe in you sir, always did.
This is the worst sci-fi movie I've ever seen.
lol is this like some new billionaire trend…. Going to space just because they can…… Nice.
80 km is not the Space
So did they find out if the earth was flat or not?
Indian flag
This gives me goosebumps. Amazing!!!
How can there still be people who believe that the earth is flat if only with this video you can verify that it is not?
1:32 when u stand up after sitting
FULLY MEGALOMANIAC !!!! this man could Stop hunger all around the world, but instead.....
Do they have vacancy for drivers?
Ladies and gentlemen, if you look out your right window you’ll see climate change before your very own eyes
Santhosh George kulangara fans😍😍
🤦🏻‍♂️
Yeh maaan faaar out,
2:55 what happened to the zero gravity? The hair of the lady on the right clearly shows there is a gravity in the cabin at the moment when they're buckling up! Seems fishy :)))
With this one flight they could feed 1000 000 kids in Africa for one year..
Imagine lost in space forever
Riiight, nothing is really impossible if you're a billionaire. Also, the weightlessness is because they're at the top of the parabola. The 53 miles up is questionable as to it being "space." I look forward to the day these ultra rich cockroaches actually use their money to help others, not race to space.
awesome fantastic space travel 👌👌
obviously a camera set..
Money would be better spent on homes for our homeless veterans. And this clown wanted the government to bail out some of his businesses during lockdown.
I heard that one ticket costs $200K. Maybe tomorrow it will cost $20K, but that would still be unaffordable for most of us. Heck, even $2k would still remain unaffordable. There are many who can't even cough up $200!!! Just to let you know what this wealth gap is all about.
the world is still flat tho.
Только миллиардеры могут себе позволить такие полёты. Бедные могут только мечтать.
No stars ✨.
Que foda!👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
WOW!!AMAZING!👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Phh.. tell me when you reach the Karman Line, Mr. Branson.
Here are the clowns. We have again staged a performance for the next generation of Humanity! Branson has 4 minutes of zero gravity. Bezos offers the old lady 4 minutes in zero gravity. Are you clowns ...... kidding? If only we could agree on different time frames in zero gravity. And it must be the same ... two billionaires ... create their own clown "apparatus" with a difference of several days. What an amazing coincidence! Hey ..... Humanity ....... you are not Humanity ..... you are the Sheep!
cool
Why in 2:55sec girl in the lower right corner on the screen has gravity already ? Her hair falls down ☝️🤔
Would have been spectacular if he blew up half way to space. Sorry hate all billionaires send them all to space, without the protection of course.
Greenpeace and Greta loves you
Scary stuff
You did not go to space. Utter fail
Bumi itu datarr😂😂😂
Parabel Flight... Zero G 🤦🏻
Waste of money this money can be used for some needy person to bring happiness in his or their life.
We should spend money repairing the damage we have done to this planet and to clean up space trash before we start destroying other places. Rich white guys have way to much disposable income.
Basically only Zero G for less than 3 mins. Only get to float for 2 mins before telling you to strap in
This is crazy they stored this at the beinagin library for 2 years and I got to see this and touch it and now it’s in space!!!
Well, ok...
Richard Rawlings has let himself go.
Fools paradise
Congratulations Virgin Galactic. Absolutely amazing.👍 Proud of you 👍🎉🍾
Awesome 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👍🏻
Shut up Richard, you pompous prat - it’s not even space.. What a massive waste of money and natural resources. Ps. Pay your taxes, leave the NHS alone and stop taking government handouts.
Where are the flat earthers...
Галактика целок - звучит неплохо
Sad that only rich people will experience this.
The man who pleaded poverty a year ago , and asked the UK Govenment to baile him out , suddenly has money to waste on trips to space , wish the crew had jettishoned him out into space
this is what it feels like every time i shoot up heroine
My dream..👩‍🚀😭
Love it, and in one video, totally debunks The Flat Earth crapola haha
but, fast 9 did it first ...
They're wearing chutes. Wonder how that works in an emergency.
I'm still waiting for the flat earthers to chime in
Environmental terrorism at its best.  😡
If I had billions of dollars, I would do everything to remove all Plastic from the ocean, street and forest. I would try hard to find a way to force big companies to not produce plastic anymore, and return to glass bottles for example. If I had billions of dollars, I would invest in research and education to make our planet more livable for future generations. I guess we all have different priorities.
crew members enjoying..  and suddenly you see Tesla passing sideways  😁😁
The earth is flat,awesome!!!
I thought we were not allowed to send trash into space
that`s , just too cool ...
As long as there’s chicken tender and Coca-Cola onboard….
please, ridiculously wealthy, narcissistic guy, entertain us
this vehicle will never carry cargo nor reach at least orbit. its just a fancy rollercoaster for rich people.
What do you plan to do to composate CO2 footprint of such selfish pleasure !
Nice CGI!
Where do I get a ticket 🎟 👍👍
for me if i go to the space , i take photos, i see all around. i dont make rotate 360 for this short moment in space.
2050 it become so comen, one day i will there.
Bravo
That looks flat to me.
I'm 51, I figure I have another 30 years left on this planet, by then it should be a routine trip through Expedia.
So can we finally squash the stupid flat earth bs
You can't even see the whole sphere or is it a a sphere 😅
What you can do is nothing as we live in an enclosed system where space travel is not possible and not even to the moon 🌝
Fake... cause you know the earth is flat right? Branson you should pack a bunch of those morons on the next flight. Pack em in like sardines, take em up, let them see it's a fkn sphere, then experience one hell of a malfunction that unfortunately prevents reentry. 🤣
Bruh this lower orbit nothing special!😅
🤣🤣🙈🙉🙊
🤣
NOTICE OF LIABILITY – DEATH PENALTY SUMMARY EXECUTION  This legal and lawful notice of liability is to inform you personally, to cease and desist all forms of participation and cooperation of the “corona virus covid-19 pandemic emergency orders” here within Taiwan or otherwise or you are here by sentenced to death by any means necessary without any further notice as an on the spot summary execution conviction death sentence. Any and all participation in the gene therapy inoculation distribution, or any form of biomedical passport which is reliant on either testing or “vaccination”, you will be executed for crimes against humanity.  As a sworn in intelligence officer of the Crown, directly partnered and deputized to the Crown authority of the King whom as in command and control of all of the weapons within the pacific ring including nuclear weapons also the highest classification of weapons under the highest top secret security clearance, the microscopic brain machine interface antenna array platform and the brain computer interfaces, we share the power to authorize summary executions for treason and crimes against humanity, as it is in warfare.  It is my unrelenting duty to inform you of my life long undercover investigation of this matter, that it is as an indisputable and undeniable fact, provable under law as a criminal conspiracy of the highest order, of which although, I do not need to actually prove in order to carry out your personal summary execution. The entire criminal plot of enslavement, genocide, extortion, coercion, terrorism, murder, armed robbery, racketeering, obstruction of justice, overthrowing law and more, was explained to me as such, over 35 years ago in expansive and comprehensive detail. There could be no other determination in my observation, all co-conspirators who are guilty of mere participation, are guilty of every capital crime which exists in a grand conspiracy against the majority of the planets’ population violating all of their unalienable rights which are protected under law.  By the authority and power vested in me, to execute you under a summary conviction, instant death sentence, you are also subject to other fines and penalties up to and including the rest of your life in prison. As a documented participant, co-conspirator, or benefactor and party to these capital crimes, you are liable for the punitive damages and life sentences in prison serving hard labor for the rest of your life, if you are permitted to live; there are currently no plans to take or keep prisoners I am aware of.  Contact your local law enforcement so as they may take your testimony of innocence if you claim such, and your declaration of non-compliance with any part of the criminal conspiracy here after. They should be able and willing to participate in the process, as they are also subject to it and should become familiar with the procedure before the time limit runs out and the executions begin. Once the biomedical passport is required to buy and sell, mass executions of the guilty participants will begin at any time without further notice. Communist Chinese Party members, affiliates or co conspirators or any other party in declared open war need not bother trying to claim innocence.
The amount of sheep that didn't realize this was a big pump and dump🤣
Is the earth flat??? 🤗😂😂😂
at 2:33 ,anybody noticed something moved fast and had a sudden change in course (near the sun)? hmm, wonder what that could be??
I wonder why they didn't have pressure suits on?
*not space
Looked kinda fake but idk lol
Congratulations from Poland.  It is something wonderful and amazing.
the future of travel is coming
see how the earth is flat
മലയാളികൾ ഉണ്ടോ ഇവിടെ? 😄
So amazing ❤
250k dollars
Lucky people
You can really see how much damage we have done to the earth.
മ്മടെ സന്തോഷ് സർ പോകട്ടെ.. അപ്പൊ കൈയ്യടിക്കാം കെട്ടോ... സന്തോഷ് സർ ബെസ്റ്റ് ഓഫ് ലക്ക് 👍👍😍😍😍
Is it for real? I don't believe it. Because you can't have external camera functioning at that altitude. Internal cameras may be working, but if so, who is controlling the camera and from where? In any case one cant switch from one angle to another, as easily as we are here. I don't believe it. Interstellar is a movie. Some of angles shown in that film are impossible for us humans, just an imagination. We simply do not have the power/control of that range. I don't know about his personal life. I am just asking if this for real.
Superb, Mr. Branson and Virgin family. 🥰
സന്തോഷ് ജോര്‍ജ് കുളങ്ങരയുടെ പ്രോഗ്രാം കണ്ടു വന്നവര്‍ ഹാജര്‍ വെക്കുക്ക

Goodluck.
Почему качество видео внутри корабля такое отвратительное? я не понимаю. Что нельзя был нормально освещение сделать и камеру 4к взять с собой?
Just for rich people
I hate rich people so much.
🧡💛💚💙 looks flat to me
🧡💛💚💙 2:24 NO DONTT!!! 🧡💛💚💙
billionaires pointless toys well played to all the taxpayers paying for this
The earth is flat.. And also why aren't tbey social distancing
Amazing what you can do with avoiding corporate tax & sueing everyone!
Куда ж без тёлочек!
This is an incredible achievement but why call it a spaceflight when it is objectively not.
I'm here for the flattard tears.
Wow
Бренсон, а чего тогда акция падает? Что за неуважение к твоим инвесторам, которые в тебя верили и ждали просадку. Ты просто шарлотан.
Reminds me of the Wright brothers first flight which was also very short. Where will we be in another 120 years?
Very cool but unfortunately these rides are only going to be for the rich I very much doubt that the average poor person will be able to take a ride
It's not like we haven't been before??
What's with the sunglasses?
The best era of space exploration is began
LOL
You cannot go weightless in suborbital flight unless you enter a parabolic free fall.  Totally fake they went no where near space.  Just a waste of time and money.
2:20 trying to open the window
Totally fake
Low earth orbit
Imagine you finally get to take a space flight and you’re seated next to a 70 year old geezer thinking he’s buzz aldrin
anyone else concernt about the wields markings on the rocket ?
Water bubbles prove that there's waters above like the Bible says.. thankyou 👍
But yet some how there’s still kids starving in this world 🌎 🤔
Flat earthers are shittin themselves.
hey 🙌 rich people in space... pathetic :)
земля почему плоская?
And then he sold stocks))))
Show this to the flat earthers haha
And now they know the earth is flat
Next mission, moon.
its very the  closest a plane aproach  to space ! very  nice next step  space ?
SHOW
Didn't the Simpson's predict this year's ago?
Rocket Racoon: How much for the spaceship?
Show us the landing show us the POV footage when the ship separates and after burners kick on
2:15 Open the window, let some fresh space air in.
🤮
Super cool
Congratulations Sir Richard, to you and all your team whom have managed to bring your vision from a dream and into reality. And that is one beautiful space-bird to behold!
It is heartwarming that human spaceflight is possible again and this time to tourists. The most anticipated is the Inspiration4 mission when tourists will get to Low earth orbit in September this year by SpaceX.
Today everything with the engine can fly to space 😆
Sadly I’ll never be able to afford a ticket to ride this rich mans toy
great guys.., amazing .....!!!
Make sure the Earth is flat!😀😁😁😳😂😂😂😂
This wasn't a space flight. Even Neil Degrasse Tyson says it wasn't.
So is it round? flat earthers???? Halo??? Anyone???
Whats the point?
Whats the point?
Oh dear...more fake space CGI. Thats high up but they arent in space.
Fisheye lenses in place. Yup the Earth is curved. 😱😱
I remember headlines of virgin claiming millions for furlough .I’m also told to sell my car to save the planet and then we see this. Unbelievable the media is praising this.
Congrats on reinventing a bulkier, slower X-15 for rich people. While all of this is mildly amusing, JPL has been flying helicopters on Mars...you know...things that have been done before. I swear, Branson and Musk are like the Ringling Brothers and Barnum Baily Circus of spaceflight.
Congratulations.
should be a way to crowdfund free flights for flat earthers.
Fake
How come Branson and the others do not need anything to breathe that high but the pilots do?
It's not really big news,the top 1 percent doing what they want,if you want to be remembered,make it affordable and go forward with research for solar colonies before earth becomes uninhabitable
big deal nothing up there,hope it crashes
Space flight? You never made it to space. 🤣🦑
And then we shall overhear voices advocating this occurred in an undisclosed location in Earth.
"space"
Like spoilt brat billionaires.. completely pointless,  deal with the S on Earth D heads. Not impressive at all imo
Stupid things
how is that even possible? earth its flat isnt it ! xD
Earth look very flat from up there
RESPECT!!!! To the next generation of dreamers you can do more than this, planet mining.
Alan Sheppard already did this in 1961 and went 30+ miles higher than Richard Branson. What was achieved here?  I also saw no rotation of the earth, and the earth didn't look like a globe, it looked like the map on the left arm of Richard Branson's Space Suit.
How is this helping or forwarding our planet/species in anyway...........SO DISAPPOINTING..........
1:47 you'll thank me later .
Just remembered how forward thinking gerry Anderson was over 60 years ago... What an achievement.. Great to see it
Just remember, during covid instead of Branson paying his staff he decided to fire them and let them go. Also not to mention all the talks about global warming etc  And people salute these rich pricks.
Aren't they only 'weightless' because their craft is falling?
and Branson wanted to claim furlough for his workforce and this is what he's spent millions on?????
ask yourself when they sit down why is their hair flat
fake news, wake up people you are watching a film
So great
Wow. Carefully cut shots of our planet. The horizon never passes the center of the lens.
Cgi
now let me see 62mls to space or 100kil  They made an altutute 282000ft or 53mls 86klms which is not space as i suspected.
So he burned more fuel than me and my family in our entire life just because he is a "dreamer", and the "climate change is gonna kill us" media are applauding....
now usually a space ship has some kind of heat shielding for rentry as things tend to get a tad warm at this time and they tend to glow due to friction of rentry have i missed some footage i do hope the logo on the underside is heat proof
🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣!! In this time of information, ignorance is a CHOISE! 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
In breaking news: crew charged for not wearing makes as covid is now space bound
Did rick have a parachute on?
Wow wow  wow  Dreams are madness too
Ce qui rend le plus heureux certains c'est de profiter du travail de milliard de personne pour profiter seul des avancer technologique que l'humain est capable de développé en laissant toujours les pauvres crevé au profit des plus riches. Il me tarde du jours la race humaine désaprendra la règle du profit mais v'est plus utopique que de vivre dans l'espace a notre epoque.
"One small YouTube video for a man, one giant for-profit venture for his business concerns"
Whats the knocking noise lol
For a child of the nascent Space Age, this carnival amusement for the ultra wealthy might just be the anticlimax of a lifetime.
So... wait... is that it? I'll save my money until I get a ticket to the moon... thanks! xD
Man right time to buy Virgin galactic stocks!!
buka warkop bisa nih kalau udah rame
This seems cheaper then what Elon is doing and his seem cheaper then what NASA is doing I wonder where the Grandpa is with the Flying Tic Tac he built in his Basement, nevermind he's out near Jupiter.
The Earth is Globe.....
Congrats! You've reached the level of 1986 year
Do people really believe this?
Huge achivement! Future!!
great job guys.
According to experts Branson is 2 miles short of TRUE SPACE . which means you’ll be left with a embarrassing option of really getting to true space in the flying dildo 😂
Awesome graphics bro
Santhosh George Kulangara lets make us proud❤
Just a bit of a gimmick.. parabolic type of high altitude flight
Anda hanya ada di posisi thermospher tidak lebih, saya tidak yakin ada orang yang mampu menembus lapisan eksospher meskipun itu NASA sekalipun. Saya berani bertaruh
So Virgin popped the cherry of commercial space flight. Irony
Dimka Rogozin & Putler = kaput
This a huge deal! Massive congrats to Sir Richard and all the amazing Men and Women who worked on making this a reality!
Look there is a stupid pervert old guy in the spaceship.
Pretty cool!  Will there be a version that goes into space, above the Karman line, like SpaceShipOne did, 17 years ago?
Nice waste of money when people are starving in the world
a rocket with the Virgin Records logo on it? Is this real? It looks like an old album cover reimagined.
Just restarted re-reading Ben Nova's books about an American capitalist building a spaceplane for rapid launches to service a satellite beaming solar generated electricity to New Mexico.
CGI
I wanna see inside the cockpit while they're ascending lol I wanna see the look on their faces while the rocket is going. I wonder how many g forces it is lol much less the modern rockets lifting off from a standstill i suppose
A sad day fore humanity
Im kinda bummed out tbat most of them just bounced around like children in a bouncy castle instead of appreciating the view and taking in the moment.  You can do the anti gravity float here on earth. Just seems like there would have people who wouldve appreciated it more.
I'm jealous in a positive way.
Im surprised we haven't heard from the flat earth believers ....
1:53 that’s what she said 😂😂😂😂😂
Fake
I wake up everyday healthy and sound without any pain, recovering so fast from my Hepatitis B disease damages after using a herbal supplements from Dr IGUDIA on YouTube.
Mr..Branson  You made a history . No matters millions  Will follow your foot steps to ..0 gravity feeling .. You conquered the  First...its a history.. A true soldier borned
Amazing  Richard and his crew and the pilot s.  And don't forget all the ground crew ....must be an amazing experience. 👍👏👏👏👏👏👏👏🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🇬🇧🇺🇸
l love your video. Large investors need to understand the content of investing completely differently than small investors do. Warren buffett once said that if he has one million of capital to invest he would guarantee a return of 40% per annum. It would be very interesting to understand the different valuation methods for valuing investment. But my question is how does these average investors/newbies understand the market price? Doing technical analysis can be quite different, which is why most newbies/traders neglect day trading their coins and stick to holding which is very dangerous as when the market goes bearish. My advice any newbie/trader to buy the dip for traders who are still wondering to enter the market, or old time traders who are holders to seek help from not just any trader but an established trading expert with at least 96% trading accuracy. I underwent series of trading losses I'd best not to talk about before I was introduced to trading analysis Mr. Brown. My contact with him has been the pinnacle of this year for me, under his careful guide In few years or so, people  will definitely be kicking themselves in regrets for missing the opportunity to buy and invest  in cryptocurrency. With his signal service, I've been able to recover my losses and even grow my trading portfolio massively, from 1.6 btc to 7btc in 5weeks. I will advice traders, most especially newbies to have orientation of trading before they involve in it. Mr. Brown makes you learn daily while you make profit with his signals. Mr Brown can be contacted via vià Tél-græm @Browndenver for inquires.
Azaming journey i wish I do this journey one day..
Oh look flat earth
One day I'm going to build a vehicle that people can drive into space and come back in one piece.....😀.
Nice flight. But what is the point of that? It's not a flight into space, is it? At best, a short trip to the edge of the atmosphere. Weightlessness is not the same as outer space. You can just do a jump on earth to be weightless.
Use Hololens for navigation
Well said, nicely done , and most importantly got home safe.  Inspire on!
Using AirPods Pro in space like apple fans❤️
Hurray, now everybody can go to space, I love you guys.
amazing
Faker than the idea that biden won the election 😩🖕💩
Great job 👍
So how many light bulbs do we have to turn off now to keep earth habitable?
This looks like a Really Expensive Amusement park ride.
1969: man walks on the moon.  2021: man flys to the end of the atmosphere and walks on space.   Seems like we are evolving backwards?..
where's the place to join the free-ticket activity? from their site i couldn't find,
See earth is flat, hence proved
Oldest man in space?
I can’t wait for a flat earther to get on one of these
flat earthers gonna cry poo poo
I see masks don't apply for the rich but anyone beneath their pay grade has to wear one on a flight 🤔
When the docking at ISS?
Really stuff of sci-fi , except is not.
I want to go. If someone says they weren't scared, would you think they are either lying or crazy?
I didn't see a floyds picture on the aircraft. And why the aircraft is white? Are they white supremacist? Why isn't there any blm there? No antifa? No trans pr lgbtquia+ people there? Why? Doesn't virgin galactic support the cause?
Amazing this Hollywood animation, it really looks like the space.
Congrats to everyone involved, another mankind's greatest accomplishment!
Amazing. I hope one day I can make that trip.
If you're a bored billionaire, everything is possible!
this is just so fucking cool and w/ implications far beyond just "billionaire tourism"
Not having gravity and being able to float around weightless is so much fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Until.......       you have to poop
🤥
love space video
DON'T SAY THIS IS AWESOME AND THEN EVER COMPLAIN ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE AGAIN....
Wow! You finally did it. Congrats to all. An amazing accomplishment.
Wow
When are the snacks served?
What do you say now you flat earth noobs... Awesome, I wish 1day this trip is affordable 4 the masses.
Rich people can now pollute our planet even faster for basically nothing. Well done. >Slow clap< Now use that brain and money to FIX our impending starvation as the planet starts drying up.
Waiting for SGK 🔥🔥🔥
Deception at it's finest!!!!! Wow!!!!!!!
I am in this video OMG YESSS!!!! 🥳
where are the stars?
Almost looks real. At 2:55 why is blonde girl's hair not floating like it was at 1:29? This is nothing more than a mimicry of the Vomit Comet flights used for decades. You're watching ClownTV 🤡
really sad to see virgin advertisement all over the spaceship.
Dudes kinda OLD THO HE COULNT LOOSE HIS V CARD AT HS OR COLLEGE PROM I MEAN DANG
Mr.Branson......your a true visionary.......
I wonder what the flat earth society have to say about this? 😂😂
When can i do this?
WOW....What a rush that must  have been.....AMAZING.....I wanna go too PLEASE.....VERY VERY AWESOME.
Cant wait to see Sir Santhosh George kulangara in it :)
I'm impress.
*Space      *Not actually space
Please don't get too excited, the biggest failures comes after over excitement
Now y'all know y'all need to stop!
Fake. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
NOTICE how there's not a single black person in that crew...black people don't take silly risk they let white people go first see what happens and then once its safe and clear they come later and dominate lol
Extremely awesome!!
Wow best ride in the park
അടുത്ത യാത്ര  സന്തോഷ് കുളങ്ങര സർ👍
so Richard,  Earth is flat or round!  hahaha
NO..    they did NOT go   into space...  just a zero gravity plane  you bunch of CGI  fools!!!
Just flying above Flat earth 🥏 as usual!  And somehow the world actually believes their in outterspace!
The lowly parrot neuroanatomically gather because underpants naturally overflow absent a wacky sarah. clumsy, lackadaisical house
Thought he would get out of the plane naked hahaha
FAKE<<  CGI >> FAKE <<>>  LIES>>> CGI  FAKE  LIES LIES  CGI  FAKE FAKE   SHAMEFUL LIARS!!
FAKE<<  CGI >> FAKE <<>>  LIES>>> CGI  FAKE  LIES LIES  CGI  FAKE FAKE   SHAMEFUL LIARS!!

As a pilot I would really pissed of. In the space and you have to sit
What is the big achievement for humanity here? Is it Rich people’s going to space?
Can one please explain why every space flight video needs to utilise a fish eyed camera lens??
Congressional Hearings MUST be held to address the 70+ yr ongoing ET cover-up.
Earth is flat or round say to muslims 😂
equal amount of man, woman, black, blonde. so beautiful and so, obviously artificial...
Now who are the next 6 that gonna pay 250k for a seat??
I wonder what the people that say Earth is flat are thinking right about now?🤔
how did they took the power of the sun
Jeb Kerman not impressed
Did anyone see that ufo at min 2:34 appear and then turn into the bright light???
I mean....the man did it.....he got into space and brung some great ppl with him.....non NASA non astronaut only....but just him, his dream and an incredibly smart team. Mans broke the barrier of space flight. Absolutely mind boggling incredible feat if you ask me. What a legend.
rocket go up, stock go down :(
Only time I’ve ever seen people due something truly epic..  and not one has there iPhones out to videotape the event
That’s not space, it’s zero gravity flight. That’s been happening for years. It’s how they train astronauts.
The whole give a speech when your in space is getting old
We need your help Virgin galctic. What are the procedures and formalities required to go to space? please reply!
I just have one question… How TF do the passengers not need helmets but the pilots do?!?!?
Yeah, the outer-limits of our atmosphere isn't outer space.  Technically, you and I standing on Earth are "in space".  Nice try, though.
1:02 his speech is so cringe OMG. Let's all be real and not mince words. This was a competition between Jeff Bezos and him. He even changed his mission schedule to do this before Jeff's flight
Ground control to major tom.  Take your protein pills & put your helmet on..........         😁
what have these guys done that has not been done before, as far back as 1962?  the X-15  went nearly 100,00 feat higher. nothing truly new.
Where is the thrust flat earth?
Mananih penganut bumi datar?
Y does it look flat
That’s amazing
its like a dream come thru for everyone! I always liked Mr.Branson Sir!
looks like a sci-fi movie scene using CGI technology
We went to the moon in the 60s...
Cool achievement, but there are better uses for that money like feeding homeless people
Well, I guess I was wrong about flat earth...🤣
they were in awe because they saw Naruto
i hope they were all vaccinated, we don't wanna have Cowona in space! Or the Intergalactic Police are gonna be really mad!
MALE INADEQUACY IS REAL!!!!!!!!
I would challenge the sun to a staring contest up there
Stupid. Bairly space and very little time.
Is everyone wearing parachutes ?
Next we need space sex
Humans have yet to go to space, we have sent things to it, but we have not yet traveled to space. . Sure it's a great achievement, but we have yet to leave earths orbit. Either the reporters know this and are just trying to hype it up, or they are incompetent of the subject they are reporting on....the later is usually true these days.
WHERE IS BS JOHN 🐕 KERRY ?
..." Look Mummy, there's a gopher up in the sky..."
Somewhere there's a flat Earth are saying the whole thing was faked
My equilibrium would vomit
Nice movie...
When I was a young boy, I watched on TV at school the first launch and landing of the first space shuttle Columbia.  That was almost 40 years ago.  Curious where space travel will be 40 years from now.
I loved Sir Richard's message to the children. Well spoken, from someone who was a child once and dreamed of flying to the stars. And did! 💜🌙🌟🚀
The great things about dreams are they're free.  Not all of us have an extra billion kicking around.
hand holds need added..
Crazy how we’re gonna star sending ppl to space now🙏❤️‼️
Fake af
How cool is that!
Don't let flat earthers see this their head might explode🤯😂 lol. Awesome job 👍 looks like a crazy experience.
Send the flat earthers up there asap!
This is going to make it possible for everyone (me specifically).
next flight the moon!
Fake 🤦‍♂️
Please send a bunch of flat earthers on of these flights. Thanks 🙏
10 years from now, the cabin will be packed with seats, crying babies and ugly flight attendants
Those with the eyes to see the truth will see...those that don't won't ...great CGI tho..
Nossaaaaa!!!eu adoro isso...me senti lá junto com eles ...senti a mesma emoção ...simplesmente inexplicável.
one word : Wow one world : everyone can taste space now.  Richard Branson : we are all astronauts of tomorrow.
So is the 🌎 flat or not? 😂😂😂
Woww
This looks so fun!
And this Ladies and gentlemen is the start of something straight out Elysium. Where the Rich and powerful get to leave to a glorious space station utopia and leave a Ravaged and distroyed Planet earth to us where we are stuck and have to fight for our own survival.
What was he trying to do PULL THE RUBBER MOLDING FROM AROUND THE WINDOW ??? HOOOOOO LEEEE
Well that was boring.
Amazing how someone can be pleading poverty not too long ago and trying to scrounge tax payers monies off a government, and then next spending Billions to go up-to the edge of space!!
2:18 lets pull out the window and get sucked into outer space!!
Money well spent......
amazing boss... take me too going to the space... 🥳🥰
I lost all respect for Branson after I heard about his romp on Pedo/Epstein's Island- It's named "Virgin" for a reason...
If they encounter aliens, all Branson needs to do to scare them off, is flash those donkey teeth at them.
Congratulations
The End Of The Religion is Beginning Gracias Seńor Por su Colaboración Now we are Free
Really want to send some flat Earthers into space and see what they have to say after their space trip.
That's great now pay your taxes
,😁😁😁 like kids in a candy shop
Now that average people can go to space maybe there wont be as many crazy flat earthers
Best of fluck
Awaiting real daily transport via a descendent of this bird…
How are they going to steal taxpayer money with this ruse?
incredible
This video is fake, earth is flat
When billionaires can afford to have their own private space race, it shows that someone isn't getting taxed enough.  Hey, Dicky, how much public money was you bunged in the form of government grants and tax exemptions?  It's sick.
😍🚀thank you richard branson for making the dreams of many that we dream come true are astronauts sometime i hope to be there🚀🚀😍
Another movie. Note at 0:14, the audio of the “main engines” can be heard as the edit cut shifted to a distant view.🤣🤣🤣😳  Using a wide angle lens that cuts to another view lest they show a “curve” become concave as a few ISS videos have.🤣🤣🤣😳
It's all staged and the Earth is flat! (sarcasm)
Are they just "Galactic" now?
If their in space why is the water droplets out side not floating instead of falling
لا تنفدون إلا بسلطان.... ههههه
Were is the stars ??????? Hhhhhh
Billionaire does to space in his own spaceship. . “ If I can do this, imagine what you can do!”  Um…. Tie a bunch of balloons to a chair, use my grandmothers oxygen tank and pretend I’m Richard Branson????
earth is flat
Didn’t Brad and Angelina sign up for a trip on this years ago? That could be an awkward flight…
And we get adverts asking fo £2 per month to help give people water and a chance to live. The world stinks.
You can do it..only 1 million dollar per ride..😄
Can't wait for the flat earthers to debunk this
Seems whelming
Why the horizon look flat? 🧐🤨🤔
Pretty amazing stuff. But why does it look like they are wearing parachutes?  Surely if there was a failure in  either leg of the journey it would be fairly catastrophic.
heinsenberg is who is piloting the plane?
Richard Branson really has lived life too the max  !  ...an amazing man .. what's next .  !! Incredible .
Awesome. Congratulations.
The reason for the weightless is because they were dropping in altitude, not because they were "in space". This was just a  Zero G flight with a better view.
Beautiful...
Tax billionaires, properly fund space agencies like NASA.
Where’s Greta Thundbergs seat?
Those fumes are Environmentally friendly too they give off a magic gas that fixes everything!
Wow. 1970 all over again.
'If we can 'afford' to do this (by dodging taxes in all countries) imagine what you can do ' 👏
1:55 - Richard Branson climaxes and then jizzes his pants
1:11    1:38     1:44
Nowadays the "Star system" is not only on Hollywood Boulevard but also in spaaaaaaace ! What a century to be alive...
still we are in tin can in the space like 55 years ago Major Tom.  It's a sad moment for Richard cause last dream is over... no purpose anymore.
Indian Flag made me Smile :D
Congrats to all!  Welcome to space.  Take care of our Earth, please!
Flat earthers are punching the air right now 😂
Flat-earthers be like....        "Please reach 2k dislikes!"
This is risky
Is there a full unedited video  ?
I don't consider this as space flight....more space jump
If you fall for this garbage,,,you probably dont realize we never went to the moon.  45-50 years ago,,the corrupted government lied to us about that too,,,
Could have been the greatest day ever.  Branson blowing up and England winning the euros.  Nothing ever works out
why they using fish eye lense for video?You dont see that do you?
Maybe a dumb question, but Im asking because I really don't know. Why are the pilots dressed in full gear, with protective helmets and oxygen, but the passengers are not? They are at the same altitude and on the same ship. Is one of those things where if they decompress or lose oxygen, there will be someone awake to pilot?
Seems like more of a publicity stunt than actual ‘space’.  I love that there is again an interest in space. This is a start but it’s not actually useful until it’s an orbital class rocket.
where is our money beaaaaaaaaaaatch
Wow, wow, and wow !!!! Ok I'm thinking seriously for a ticket ! .. when you think about it,  it's less expensive than buying a full equipped Recreational Vehicle !! If millions of people from boomer generation has already bought an RV as a dream.. That means today millions of people want to go in space for a dream less expensive than their parents did for an RV. 😲wow ! I can feel the space calling me for a Virgin Galactic Ride
Eat the rich
Your move flat earthers.
Big boys with their toys !
over in a blink just hype waste of time
It's pretty impressive. Yeah you might dismiss it as being sub orbital or even below the Karman line but cmon, it's a rocket ship that goes so high you see the blackness of space and float for 2 solid minutes in weightlessness. The fact mediocre (ok wealthy) humans can now easily get to this strange place where primates shouldn't be able to reach is incredible. I feel we are on the cusp of something special as a species. Be happy you can witness this in your lifetime, rather than living out your miserable 40 years of lifespan in the middle ages barely knowing or seeing anything beyond the extent of the village you were born in. No electric lighting, no Nintendo, not even Pornhub. Make the most of this great time we live.
You must think we’re all gullible. You didn’t go to space. You can’t go . How can you go somewhere that doesn’t exist?
To much energy for the fun of rich people.... Dumb
So the pilots wore Oxygen masks and the crew had nothing?
hey you should fix the title, it should be 'nearly in space flight'
Looks like an early 2000’s music video in there..
And this is the guy that was begging the UK government for millions to save his Airline company. W⚓. 👎👎
Earth is plane? Kkkkk
everybody knows the windows are just monitors. it's fake. the Earth is flat, duh😜💢🥴💯💯💯
can't wait to get side-kicked, just like in the local swimming pool.
If you do not know what to do with your money. Dream! 🤢
IF ANYONE BELIEVEA THIS IS REAL, PLEASE GET UR HEAD CHECKED!!!
Why do you support this? We should call out stuff like this.
Yeah lap it up Branson, whilst the rest of us down here are losing ours freedoms. You and your rich mates have a lot  coming.
Why didn’t you bring a black man or women? Seems kind of racist tbh. BLM ✊🏿
People can see and feel the authenticity of Richard’s crazy happiness ! His dream comes true! 🌎🌏🌍🌎
Amazing!!!    i would have loved to see their faces during rocket boost.
And it doesn't look like a giant dong
Any chance of a seat on the next trip🙏 thanks in advance!!
I am in space right now.
What a remarkable time just to think 200 years ago we where on horse backs now to space wow may the truth always prevail
Great now the flat earthers will use you as proof of a flat earth
Shame the wanker came back to earth
Never tell a man not getting any that he won’t get into space because he will and he will put his sexual past on the bottom of it.   Virgin
So who are these women that went with him? His girlfriends? 🤣😂
awesome Richard should open a bag of potato chips upon reaching space
Great words from a great man. Congratulations Sir Richard Branson. What an awsome achievement. Humans are amazing. What a time to be alive
hi everyone, we're the space bullshitters
Hats off to billionaire bearded Branson 👏👌
Anyone ever hear of CGI just more fake news.
I think these passengers should get more hobbies and interests. How can you not feel you have just wasted thousands on a BS
Technically they weren’t in space.
He looks so cool with the thumbs up at the end haha, it finally happened!
Now I’ve seen it on YouTube I can save some money & not get a ticket !!  Wonder what flat Earthers will say about this
Yet an other toy for billionaires to play with. Inviting other billionaires to pay the billionaire to join his toy. Hiring Bono for a benefit concert to ease their conscience.
Очень круто.
Il faut vraiment considérer la vie sans aucune valeur pour la risquer de si stupide façon.
Hello
Hi
Waiting for santhosh George kulangara departure😍😍😍😍😍😍
😂😂😂
We should protect our unique planet imagine there is no oxygen in the space no food nothing radiation from the sun and vastness of nothingness.
What about us stock holders you go have fun then decide to dump 500 million in shares and drop the price thanks for nothing
Dumb as hell! Waste of money.
Hells bells 🔔 🔔 🔔
Looks super fake
Imagine how much more time they would have in weightlessness if the engine fired for another 10 seconds… they could also go even higher than BO.
And how many millions did they need to pay for those 2 minutes in space??
Reeks of Elon Insecurity Syndrome 😆
Nice diverse cast
This seems fun, i shall attempt this in Kerbal Space Program, Aerodynamics shall be on my side!
Way to go you rich assholes
Дед верни деньги пульсянам
First citizen in space, but too busy video blogging to pay attention to the view. 🤦‍♂️
Branson with another one of his rich Men's toys, why not invest in our planet your airlines are destroying by pumping out all that pollution.
Is there a toilet onboard?
Bigger windows next one👍
You are not in space...Knock head.
Parabolic curve. Complete farce.
“Welcome to space” there not even in space lol
now i know why my virgin bill is so high!
They have a plane like this
Awesome nice one 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👍
Fake and gay
To all flat earthers Please tell me how you think the earth is flat i really want to no
Amazing, rich people doing cool stuff while the rest of the world is slowly burning. Have fun while it lasts.
1:11, 1:44, nice curvature....
why couldn’t they show the drop from inside the cabin?
Pretty cool. He looks thrilled, you can tell by his expression this was probably the best day of his life, the realization of a life long dream. Congrats, Mr Branson!
В современном обществе сознание мужчин запутано,запутано женщинами: бабушками,матерями,воспитателями,учителями,подругами,женами,дочерьми,коллегами и т.д.Женщины манипулируют мужчинами сначала на уровне физиологии и биологии,а за тем ещё и с помощью детей.Мужчины откройте глаза,откройте сознание.Первый и главный вопрос,который мы должны решить: Дети после развода в не более чем в 55% случаев, и не более 55% детей должны оставаться с женщинами. В остальных случаях, на законодательном уровне, дети должны постоянно проживать с отцами.Вот главный вопрос.Мужчины будьте смелыми.Ребенок дома утром 2 часа и вечером 3-4 часа,остальное время он спит или в садике или в школе.Это несложно воспитывать ребенка.Забирайте своих детей себе!!!Боритесь за них!!!Живите с ними,а женщины пусть идут дальше по свету.Если мы решим эту главную! задачу,другая половина человечества начнет себя вести точно лучше.Надо объединяться также как женщины.Надо в судах бороться за своих детей.Всегда.Осознайте это.Ваши дети-это ваше счастье,а женщина его у вас законодательно забирает.Оставьте своё счастье себе.Начните мыслить по-новому. Мужчины, откройте сознание.Впустите в свою жизнь роль отца,с которым дети остались после развода.Это будет революция отношений.  Современные гетеросексуальные мужчины находятся в ещё большем меньшинстве чем ЛГБТ. Части прав у ЛГБТ нет, у гетеросексуальных мужчин эти права как бы есть. Но они позорно лишены этих прав. Большинство женщин незаконно неконституционно забирают у отцов родных детей после развода. Родить-это физиология половых органов, как обезьяна
Au moment où l'on doit faire attention à la planète  Il y a toujours  des  mégalo pour trouver des nouvelles sources de pollution  L'argent rend vraiment très con
Can they use not a fish eye cameras
Dont open the window 🤕
Waste of Time and énergy.
really disappointing
so.....are those air bubbles I see coming off the "craft"???.....hmmmmmmm......or are those "ice" particles???..... ; D
No space suits no oxygen mask miles in the air?
That's space alright
0:40 OH PRETTY BUBBLESSSSS
Isnt re-entry the hardest part? why didnt that can, they were in, burn up in the atmosphere upon re-entry?
Stevewilldoit's next video. I give a lambo away. From spaccceeee.
No ordinary pax, all with parachutes, only show for the cams...
Celebrity roast on entry
Look how flat that Earth is……
I'm curious what the UV exposure is compared to a regular flight?
Did anyone else catch the ufo watching them around the 2 minute mark?
Wow he did what US and the Russians accomplished 60 years ago.
If the travel to space become a commercial business There will be accident  I garanty ya Just do the math… make the count of every travel to space …less than 400 in 60 years and still …2 major explosions Now how many travel/day virgin want to shedules?
Flat earthers making the excuses now for what they just witnessed
Anyone know why they are wearing sun glasses?
Hey you kids down there: "Wasn't this guys company recently bailed out with state money ?"
And all the while we get told that we need to be eco friendly Branson goes and starts to do space holidays
Branson definitely rehearsed that speech a few times in the mirror before
Amazing to see what humans can do. I'm more than happy staying on Earth.
Meanwhile he says look at the beautiful earth...spending millions for his thrill...I wonder if he saw millions of people out of jobs and food during this pandemic.
convex earth confirmed ...
Lol fake bs
THIS VIDEO SHOULD HAVE BEEN LONGER THAN 3 MINUTES, I WILL REMEMBER THIS DAY FOR A LONG TIME....
I have been saying the earth is an inward facing ball - see 1:38.
when she started to put her seat belt on I thought of all those times i was in someones car and there seatbelt would just jam and not pull so i could put it on... I would spend the money to get to go to space and end up getting the seat with that seat belt
The whole time, I had the feeling that Sir Richard was doing his best Stevie Wonder impersonation.
Hooray, he won the billionaires pissing contest.
Все здорово! Но зачем акции уронили?! Наказали инвесторов за то, что они поверили в вас и вашу компанию.
So nobody mentioned the flat earth? Iam depressed.
Glad to see you are all having a fantastic laugh up there while huge amounts of people down here are suffering hard. Go suck on a meteor!
To obscurity and beyond.
Earth still isn’t a ball fyi
And yet 6 months ago he was asking for a bail out. 🤞 For an 💥
I would be absolutely terrified to do this
greedy life.
Thank you for sharing Sir Richard……I love it! Such a wonderful video.
Beautiful.  This makes me proud to be a human.
Mother Earth 😘
“Welcome to space.”  Doesn’t say much for the pilot, does it?
the worlds deed he likes to see it above . rock on man .
I have to pay more to heat my home and travel to work and stop my local traditions ……but this is perfectly ok when it comes to climate change 🤬🤬
Not impressed
1:22 Indian Flag🇮🇳😍
That was uneventful to say the least.
acid trips in space are the future
So they can make a suborbital flight, but they can't spring for 4k cameras... much disappoint.
Amazing... Congrats - Team Virgin....
looks like a movie
I am no orbital mechanics expert or rocket scientist but this "flight into space" seems like a glorified cannon shot into the upper atmosphere accompanied by a garden variety free fall back to earth. Nothing more than what you could experience on a roller coaster. I could be ignorant of what actually took place. I'm happy for Bransons genuine excitement though.
and on that day a vigin became a chad
I’m not sure that is space. Not above the Karman Line.
Flat earth?????
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Die Reichen können CO2 verbrauchen, da ist Umwelt Schutz scheiss egal
Ohh  guys ,they  just reached karman line. ( which is above 100km from the earth.y you people so excited ?I don't know.
GREAT MAN !
What is the reason for that???
Not the same videos,,,Broke as last ditch 2 try and same your shitty investments ,,last 2 show up in lol...US.  GOVERNMENT  SHOULD NOT  BAIL U OUT......THAT'S IT..LOL ...poser/ELON HE'S NOT EVEN IN YOUR LEAGUE..
Where's all the stars? ......    Same with Elon's CGI car in space.....    No stars.....  If this is true, can we please start firing Politicians and celebrities into space who support the satanic lockdown and Va-xx agenda? .....   Obviously we won't allow them to return.
Well done Sir Richard Branson! Congratulations!  I bet other millionaires and billionaires are afraid and jealous to travel that high in space, because they are afraid that they might suddenly die and lose their dimes and everything due to spaceship failure or any catastrophe that might arise along the flight.
Fake like always
That's pretty cool!!👌
SpaceX is soooo much better. When you start bringing people to the space station let me know.
Would have been really nice if the windows were not distorting (concave/convex) the view.
flat earthers are gonna have a party over those shots of earth out the window. the window wasnt big enough to get the curve of the planet in shot lol
Is the Earth still flat?  Bring them in to the next flight so that they know their whole life has been a waste.
I will never say Ahdawlt the same.
Congrats Sir Richard!  You've earned it! I remember when I was a child I saw a commercial along time ago (early 90's) with you in it and you were in space in the commercial and I knew it wasn't real then. But I can tell this is real now. Again you've earned this success congratulations! See what happens when you reach for the stars?
We are forced to use bicycles to reduced co2 emmisions and rich people using space tracel for fun . How much co2 emmisions make 1 flight ?
Funny how at a certain altitude anti-gravity just suddenly occurs!
are yall accepting applications for a flight attendant?
imagine if it crashed, or if bezos ship goes down
Yeah…. You can have it 🥱
My internet supplier is virgin, it's been on the blink for two days now and that fucker is in space laughing at me
Wow
Told yea it would happen back in 1965 the future is here thanks to the X-15
I wear my sunglasses in space so I can so I can....
Flat Earth idiots are having a bad day today. 😂 🤣🤡
So for 3.5 minutes he'll charge you a million. Got to make the flight worth while for all the spent fuel
How many miles are they up?
a billionaire funded by you the taxpayers, to go on a joyride to space!! how lovely
Next is to test the warp cells to get Vulcan's attention to welcome us to the galactic whole of what we call the Milky Way galaxy.
Fish eye lenses. Just saying.
too bad it is all fisheye lenses
गुड सत्तू और चना ले गए या नहीं ?
What is point of going up if you are keeping glasses... stupidity!
Please note that your life jacket is under your seat.
People can't even get healthcare in the greatest country in the world. Young people go to college and graduate deep in debt. Don't stop dreaming, that's as far as you'll get.
Where's the curve, huh? oh wait, found it.
um actually they are still in earths atmosphere, technically.... most dont know, but our atmosphere extends out to about 6200 miles.......so ya, ripoff as they are not actually in "space"....
Then their stocks plummeted.
Nothing is impossible. All you need is billions of dollars.
Space, brought to you by Pepsi
Молодец, жизнь одна, надо наслаждаться, тем более, если бабки есть
F**k me!
Cool stuff its about time . This is  what it must have been like for the pilots of the X15 back in the 60s except it went 354,000 feet @ mach 6 and then landed on a runway.
What’s that stuff coming off the spaceship?
The earth doesn't look as flat as some people still believe it is! Lol.   Very cool stuff right here.
Hats off to Sir Branson! 👍🏾💖
Thats not a rocket, thats a customer post Taco Bell!   Awesome!
looking out through the window ...down on our beautiful home.... there at least 3 billion lives down there that are struggling for tomorrows meal... while king pin branson inflates his billionaire ego..
Well done Branson and Virgin
And this ain’t affecting climate change. 🙄🙄🙄🙄
Fire. Laugh at their human height flights
Bravo Richard and Virgin Galactic, amazing launch, and beautiful view, we could see the euphoria in the passengers eyes, To The Stars and Beyond
I can't wait for the flat earthers to get a hold of this 🤣
Excellent-Amazing-breathtaking!
Marvellous! 'm so happy for you, SRB. Big kudos to Burt Rutan!
Well done Richard Branson. For envisioning it and making it happen. Lots of work behind the scene.
LOOK the earth is flat!!! oh wait it's not. who would of thought, yet another proof that it's not flat lmao. I bet they will try to disprove this video, and say that it's fake.
Wow you went as high as the space station, that’s still in the glass dome congratulations
A quarter million dollar for 5 minutes of agitation and doing things for the sake of doing them in a hurry without any privacy in this potentially glorious moments in a much too narrow tube? NO. Thanks. Try it again.
Fake
He can a plane built but he can't provide a reliable internet network, keeps hanging.
“Space” flight is a stretch…
I like how that one woman just becomes a ball that the others are passing to each other lol.
Not one person noticed earth going concave to convex while these people were in "space"  how far up is sapce? Low earth atmosphere is1200 miles up.. its the farthest we have ever gone..  duck duck go it if you don't believe.
So ameteur... Very Primitive Boring 🥴
The Offspring in space, nice
This is just amazing! Reactions are so exciting! Wow! 🤩
And mankind had made another leap into the future. This is beautiful. A well deserved entry for the history books.
Earth is still round. (Verified again)
Send a flat earther up please 😂
Oh look, the EARTH is ROUND!!!!!!!!!!
Wow historically!!
The earth's flat, this is in a studio.
Something for bored people. Better solve problems on earth first before polluting universe as well.
beautiful, beautiful earth that people like you are slowly destroying
Cue the flat-earthers and hoax society...
The slow death of flat earth finally has begun ! :)
While you were up the Richard you could of looked for some of the money you owe the taxman
Really should have prepared a better speech. That was shocking
Something did flew up then quick right at the 2:35 mark…
I hope they need to call Virgin customer service for support 🤣
I could have sworn something flew up then sharp right turn in last 10-15 seconds of the video..
They didnt actually make up into the space as they didnt cross the official karman line the gravity loss effect is just freefall due to the jet inclination at a critical angle.😬
Fake.
Honestly I'd love to experience that. I would want to go around the globe, at least one orbit. Hopefully night time scenes of cities, sunrises and sunsets and the cherry on the cake the aurora borialis or an eclipse from space. Well Done Richard I'm so happy some success has happened and a first. Would love to know if this spacecraft can orbit please?
Zero gravity can be done in an aeroplane.
*flat earther has left the chat*
Guess I won’t be the first virgin to go to space
And yet billionaire Branson had the audacity to ask for public money to cover Virgin Atlantic, use your own money to save your bread and butter business before shitting it away to race to space
look fake sorry
Sues the NHS because he lost a £82M contract, pays zero uk taxes, asks for a £500M government bailed out. 🙄
Yep Flat
They look shaky and scared. Is it just me? Although I would be scared too if I was there.
He sounds like the general at the end of band of brothers giving the last speech.
His is what will be put into history -- not the rest of us who have suffered and will only further
just wow! - bravo Mr B
This launch has been definitely faked. But just in case it is not - congratulations!
Would love to see footage from inside during the burn.
Sitting waiting for the flat earthers to lose their minds
@2:20 Not sure that's supposed to come off like that
not a spaceflight.....
Put Donald Trump in There
Everyone was expecting a HR...baby steps they hit a single
FIsheye windows? faking the curve as usual.
Would it have been a better idea to go up into space at night??? That way they wouldn’t need sun glasses???
Karens: Where are the flight attendants???  I want to speak to your manager
The imagination is there.... all you need is money!
Flat earthers. De bunked ......bravo Sir Branson
it would be nice if you helped poor people instead of fucking about in space
Question. Are they wearing parachutes?
Money may have been better spent feeding and housing the homeless
At 2:18 I was like omg he broke the seal lmfao
I feel like they dint go far enough
That's a dream worth working towards.
Elon has put his deposit down for a future mission. 🚀✊
Lets open the windows
CGI is a hellova drug
Sweeeeeeet
So many fathers, if only had they shot these so called  celebrities into space, way before space ships came along would have been of greater service....
How close was Branson to Epstein? And what egomaniac needs to be called "sir"? Plutocrats should not be WORSHIPPED.
Felicitaciones Richard Branson, saludos desde Machu Picchu Perú 🇵🇪
Bet he practiced that speech in front of a mirror
Me da risa cuándo ponen tomas de lejos.  quién estaba flotando a lo lejía para tirar foto? No me venga que había un satélite de casualidad.. Jjajajajaja
If you were to dig a tunnel straight through the earth to the other side same width as your shoulders (so you can't turn around) and jumped down it feet first, what would come out the other end first, feet or head?
Very cool!
White people get us places first.  Only hating us cos you aint us.
Fake fake
Branson's hair piece looks the business.
Nope, not a space flight. Sorry Richard.
If this was such a success why has share price plunged!!
Lol what a bunch of crooks and liars
Congratulations!!! Truly amazing
Near-space flight.
Big whoop, so they strapped a glider on a plane with a rocket for propellent. boosted themselves to the top of the atmosphere for a while and then glided back down. nothing special.
This was already accomplished back in 1969 lol
Never entered outer space, lies lies lies
So they filmed it underwater then 👍🏻
It's not outer space, its high altitude they flew up so high that their bodies floated for awhile and then they came down again. What's new other than new people?
E ticket
stop the idiotic co2 emissions👹
FAKE,  ITS CALLED GREEN SCREEN
Pointless, senseless, capitalist and decadent behavior. Nothing more, nothing less.
Every rich person: For the kids out there….(qoutes)
how easy it is to fool the space loving tards.  They believe anything.
Another toy invented with no real results, lets get far away from our big mess up on this beautiful planet and think its an achievement. waste of freaking money.
The earth is Flat , Do u see it?
Billionaires in space should be mandatory and no in and out privilege.
A billionaire just did something the government did 60 years ago. Nothing impressive about this. Let me know when he Lans on the moon
If only those Texas Democrats would have fled the State in this....
I dont know what this accomplishes.
Some great people and I'm stuck with loser's
Mark my words. I will be in space one day . 👌
The Earth is definitely flat
What a waste of 💸💸
Isn't this just a "glorified parabolic flight"?
Richard Branson has to invest billions to see see t space...without any investor I can see t space from my smartphone...
Nice that Richard takes the opportunity not to sell ,but to empower and look at this experience with innocence......after all the time  investment , money  and lives of the team, he kept it pure and humble . All credit to him and his team ....dreamers the lot of them
You finally caught up to Russia who did this in 1961......you da man!
this guye should better help poor peaple not spending millions on childhood dreams.lots of rich people spending on useless thinks .out there is people who don't have home and food to feed their kids.
Fake.
I wonder why so short?
chair does not seem too comfortable
So.... weigthless 30 kilometers from earth? How come the moon has a gravtitational pull on our water from a mutch greater distans?
Flat-Earthers, where are you?
That is so cool
we why cant see what hapend  ib start inside the "plane"?
im amazed how they went up there with no fear, handled the amazing g-force so well. it was like watching astronauts that had been in training for years. im surprised they didnt show on board video of them as the rocket engaged or as they "returned" to earth. that would be epic. and if i was richard, id check the window seals before you go to "space". i dont think you should be able to pull the rubber away at all. you cant even pull the rubber on a bus window seal. or even a car window.. strange. my fear is that the reality of this is that they didnt leave earths orbit at all. imagine going through all that and showing a few clips of video, surely youd want to show the whole wide world everything you experienced. sure would shut up those idiot flat earthers wouldnt it? and anyway, if you do believe in space, we went to the moon around 60 years ago so in comparison with todays technological advances, this was nothing anyway. my smartphone has more processing power than was used to get a spaceship to the moon back then, just for perspectives sake.
Jeff, you're next!  Then Elon; then Tom!  Then Me when I win that contest!
If everybody didn't pay their taxes like Branson imagine what we could all do with that money lol.
Bubbles at 1:15-1:18 how’s that possible people come on really......
I just love his reaction - how he is shaking a little from happiness! A wonderful human being!
It's always the same view of Earth for 50 years they never show nothing different something is weird
I bet the guy with earphones is listening to Space Odyssey theme :-)
Branson: giving a heartfelt speech  The crew: playing catch with their bodies
2:17 No sir! Dont open that window!!
Wondering if more grab handles in the cabin would be useful.
flatearthers where we at🙋
It's amazing. If they give scholarships, I can try a ticket
so Bezos stunt just going to be 2nd to this, hey Jeff I know how you going to beat this, be the first CEO to never come back
Fake CGI.
الحمدلله
Imposter.
i was thinking if a re-entry burn is necessary but then realized that it’s not the same re-entry from outer space that a space shuttle does! Nevertheless, Mankind is amazing!
I really hoped they would've come down as different persons and had seen this globe as "one" place for people without borders. Instead we got high fives and thumbs up.
No meal, no drinks, no movie? Meh
How happy they are☺☺
Lol
CGI    FAKE
Thrill seekers
Private companys spend billion on rockets and space exploration People with no money: earth is flat
Remember kids, we don't float in space. There's always gravity coming from somewhere.
A small step for mankind, a giant leap for Branson's wallet
Let us tell how many km they go up in sky...?
I just paid millions of dollars so that I can float in almost zero gravity for few minutes...
And people were hating on him..."He didn't really go to space"...... People are so petty, This is Amazing for him.
Amazing!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Looks unreal. So many things missing from this craft. Hmm.
0:53 apna jhanda
I feel like those UAP tic tacs are like watching and saying to themselves "pfffft, humans"
Calling this high flying 'space travel' is over reaching. To me there is a huge difference in potential between an airplane that can launch another airplane that bounces up to merely just reach space and a little time of weightlessness and then falls back  versus a rocket which can travel into the higher 'real' space with the possibility to stay in orbit. Virgin is no match to how far SpaceX is already. I just do not understand the fuzz about Virgin at this stage.  Calling this high flying "space travel" by "astronauts" is utter bull. Let's call it space travel when the ship can stay up in orbit with very minimum force like for instance satellites in orbit. Let us call everything else just "high flying"
Paying 200k for a glorified plane ride? Please come back when you actually go to space.
Pay my rent and car payments for 10 years or 10 minutes  in space???......hmmmm decisions...decisions
I hope they got a vomit regulations in place so that flight is not ruined...
Can we have our hospitals back please? Thanks.
Would of liked to see more shots outside the craft to see how it looks from so far above tge earth it seems kinda strange we don't get a lot of outside footage
Incredibly awesome.  Congratulations, Sir Richard!   The sky is *NOT* the limit!
To all the dreamers out there, revisit this comment when we return from Mars 10,20,30... years from now. After all nothing is impossible. Congratulations 👏
The seats should be designed to fold away to allow more room to move around in the cabin.
What a waste of money. I wish I didn't have to pay tax 😐
There are people starving to death and dying of preventable disease on this planet while billionaires are blasting themselves into space
Notice the fish eye cameras for outside shots, you can't see the curvature at that height
r/absolutemadlads
Wacthing from SP Brazil.
Congratulations. So cool.
Fake
Great
Can someone explain why the drops of water fall direct down to earth. While everybody is inside is weightless?
This is the same guy that wanted the government to use the public's money to bail out his company through covid as he plays in his new spaceship, yeah niceone 🧐🤔
So does this prove the earth is round or?
wow. my favourite clip at 2.30. sun soooo close. and tiny.
Sonho
Can we see from the pilots view 🥰
Soooo fake. Disney for adults.

Why does this seem weird?
santhosh george kulangara പോകുന്നത് കാണാൻ കാത്തിരിക്കുന്നവർ ഉണ്ടോ???
What ???? No inflight drinks????  No stewardess...no toilet... What a shitty flight...
Too much money, too little sense.
Bahahaha
Childhood dream🥳.... Wooooow
Spirit of stupid human.... STOP TV CORONA SHOW NOW and people Wake up
Am I the only one who saw Indian flag on her arm? 1:03
Flat Earthers on suicide watch.
🙈🙊💩💩💩💩💩💩💩
Wooov..dožili sme sa reálne,Verneoviek 😎👍
Can’t be a Virgin if you did it
Branson really needed some space.
Want to go to space everyday people? Just sell your home for one trip!
Like a Virgin , the body fly for the very  first time
stupid billionaires wasting money that they stole from the people through tax avoidance.
Where the flat Earthers at???
What about more pollution???
this is incredibly inspiring. i was overcome with joy witnessing this!
Fake! Earth is flat
give a ticket for the most  terraplanist activist in the world....to stop that stupid idea
Furlough money spent well 🙄
"To the next generation of dreamers, if we can do this, just imagine what you can do"  Next-generation: Has to save the planet they're looking at from climate change due to excessive resource consumption and pollution
Nice sir 😀
This is awesome ❤️
Oh my the fakery just gets better, well it doesn't actually. Any keen eye can spot them.
Wow! Love you guys.....😊🇮🇳❤️👌
everything is possible.. with the right influence, being born into the right social class, with the right capital. So sad.. watching a multimillionaire's dream come true.. as for the rest of us, it's gonna be shitty work after shitty work no matter how much harder we try. Because impossible is real.
Now we are living under tyranny and in a hunger games world this space flight for the super rich couldn't be more relevant!!!!
Honestly, I'm afraid of flights. If I was up there, I would be eager to get back to the ground. Nonetheless, must've been an awesome experience.
I wish am the one in that ship enjoying..
I wonder if you could possibly take me next time
There's still a lot of gravity there
Richard Branson has already been to space. Haven't ya'll seen Superman Returns already?
Our planet 🌍 😊😊🙏🙏🙏
Молодцы!
Ради этого стоит жить! Прекрасно, когда мечты сбываются! Это великая цель!
He makes all the money from consumers of his products. Instead of helping the poor he is using the money to experiment with space flights.The cost of the one hour flight is US200K.Only for those small numbers who can afford it. Another two billionaires is doing the same.They should combine their resources to cut costs and the savings goes to the poor.
0:11 Is flat... <3
Hey! Look at that. Earth isnt flat
So Branson? Was the earth flat?????…..lol…..
That's a CGI!  - flat earther
Why do flat earthers always wait a couple of days before their "it's flat" comments?  Don't be skeered, get in there when the video is new so everyone can see your idiotic posts.
If only it exploded.
Its amazing i really want to travel space before i die..but...m not a millionaire
This is just a zero gravity flight! Up and down! No biggie, go past the firmament! Then I’ll be impressed!
Wait, so the earth isn't flat? ..........lol
Bubbles in space????
Earth looks pretty flat.....
That's insane
2:57 they are in space and trying to buckle up, some seconds later, they edit and are close to earth.  Alliens took their place, confirmed
milyander  lebay  kampungan.
Not forgetting Branson pleads no money and gets his project funded with British Taxpayers money.
In the middle of a pandemic…😂
Fake as hell! Everybody knows the earth is flat!
Big whoop....a high altitude plane ride. Must be for those with more dollars than sense.
That's it?!
This call DSTO right ?
And still some specialists believe that earth is Flat,,,, chapta....ahem ahem.....😉😉 and not spherical...
This is amazing!
Thumbnail looks like SmashMouth album
Imagine how many hungry children he could have fed on that budget.
only 4 minutes for a quarter million dollars is a ripoff I think.   They should at least complete an orbit or two.    He doesnt even offer a t-shirt or anything.  Not even a sandwich, or peanuts, or a stiff drink so you dont worry when he tugs at the window to try to get out because he is getting antsy and wants to get off the ride.  It would be easier to be weightless if you parachute.  The trip lasts longer.
why does this look fake as hell
They could have accomplished the same thing with the Vomit Comet. Meh..
These are really great technical achievements, but I really wish they wouldn't use the terminology "going to space" for these kind of flights.  I'm not sure the general public fully understands the difference between a ballistic flight crossing an imaginary boundary into "space" and actually GOING to space - into orbit.  At the end of the day,  there is really not much long term value in these kind of flight aside from the brief feeling of weightlessness.  These are really glorified vomit comet flights.
Quiero trabajar en Virgin Galactic, es un sueño!! Sin lugar a dudas el lugar que siempre quisiste estar se hizo posible, es real, eso fruto del trabajo y esfuerzo! Felicidad plena en lo mas alto
Wonderful flight. Unfortunately, during that fly thousands of people were starving to death. Is space tourists the best thing we can do on Earth ???
Branson sounded like Martin luther king jr when he was safely into space lol
Ça fait cher le tour de manège 😂😂😂
I can smell the sulfur coming from those "engines"...
This is the guy that was asking for government bail out right?
Looks round to me 😂
Vanity Galactic--not really pathbreaking in the least. Billionaire's tinkle match...score 15 to love. Bezos serving next
Are those onboard virgins?
In Amerika steigen die Temperaturen und hier werden Tonnen von Treibstoff sinnlos verballert.
why hasn't this been done earlier...? everything shown in this video, technology-wise have been around for at least 20 to 30 years.
Subscribe to the NDL and Niko Omilana or you are a schmuck
my 2 cents are there too...I bought some Virgin records LPs in the 80s!!
Don't let anyone tell you what you can do, sure, if you have a bank account with millions like this guy 🤣
Fish Eye lens to make the earth look round!
I would of loved to see the video unedited where is the footage of them going mach 2? Are they not required to wear O2 masks as wel as the pilotsl im confused lol!!!
Everyone, ask yourselves - what empty space inside of you would this trip/adventure fill? At what cost? When I rebuild a junk bike and give it to a child the smile I witness is brighter than the Sun and that child is what makes this Earth so special. That feeling is what fuels me and sends me over the moon.
You can tell its real by how fake it looks.
This not a space ....... 122 km guys ...
The only useful thing "space travel" has yielded so far is starlink  This is just billionaires feigning an expenisve hobby as progress.
LOL 0.G PLANE
I guess they should change the name now?
"Noctilucent clouds are composed of tiny crystals of water ice up to 100 nm in diameter and exist at a height of about 76 to 85 km (249,000 to 279,000 ft), higher than any other clouds in Earth's atmosphere." - so either there are clouds in space ... or you didn't go to space. I smell a class action lawsuit.
Mr Branson,  My Internet has been getting slower and slower since Sunday and is now running at 5mbps. I've been waiting for a response all week.  When you get back to Earth I'd appreciate a timely update please.  Regards, Ian Flute
I'll spend my spare 600k on a horse farm thank you very much.
I can hear the dems now..."Covid, you should be wearing masks and social distancing!"
He didn't go into space....
NOT impressed. SpaceX looks serious, this is just tourist attraction marketing - lick the space, go back, lighter from 10mln dollars.
Can someone please add this in Microsoft Flight Simulator ? :))) <3
Дешёвая постановка а не полёт
“ if we can do this.. just imagine what you can do”  Me: went to Tesco for a meal deal
I mean anything is possible even blasting a hole in the ozone for nothing but a billionaires ego trip sod scientific research…
Numerous those photos look like a Flat Earth to me
So how would a flat earther explain the curvature of our planet? Honestly and respectfully asking.
Sir Richard Branson the modern day Sir Francis Drake! I am proud to share my name with this great British icon and Gentlemen!!!!!!!!
congrats team
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️Virgin G🅰️lactic ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Please pay your fair share of taxes.
Вы слышите эти стуки за бортом? Это русские молотками стучат по обшивке)))
This is indeed amazing. The puppet show is great and the masses were fooled.  I like though how Branson looks stressed when in supposed zero g because zero gravity doesnt really exist outside the parabolic movements of zero g planes and isnt realy effortless.
A funny thing happened on the way to the moon
That's incredible.  Oooo my days
Notre belle terre plate 😇
Welcome to 2021!!! Amazing!! And congratulations
👏👏👏
No more tax breaks or bailouts for the billionaires.
Virgin>roscosmos.
The well-groomed van chiefly pause because account jekely wreck versus a warm protocol. orange, daily wound
is it flat? someone answer please
HAHAHAHAH NO THANK YOU IM FINE ON THE DIRT
All this pollution just for a few seconds of enjoyment??? Nah thanks
This is really amazing.
I have invested 1000 dollars in spce
So I don’t know burst anyone’s bubble but. A normal comercial plane can do that. Also they never left earth’s orbit. Please let’s do some research. This is how one sets up a satellite 🛰 this is common. The masses probably think it’s never been done before wow big achievement lol
Когда следующий полет планируете? Кто полетит известно уже?
Wow! That is cool 😎👍🏽
Fake as expected.
This is how history is made
1:47 Earth is flat
Yang masih bilang bumi datar 😰
"To the next generation just imagine what you can do" Nah mate you took all the resources and left nothing
Id be less obsessed with floating around and cheering and more interested in taking in the view of the earth if I was onboard.
He should have sent a message to all flat earthers XD
is this a bad time to say i have to go the the bathrooom
Wow! That looks so amazing, and what a view of the earth
Billionaires and their toys. Playing while many millions go hungry today.
Fantástic!!!
I was wondering what the banging was but I think it is the boosters firing to keep them positioned
What a joke!  How totally fake!!  Looks about as real as the car in space.  And nice fish eye lens!  You people that believe this nonsense need to wake the hell up!  Nvm, enjoy being blissfully ignorant.
Nice try.
Did Branson trying to open the window???.omg!!!..😯😮😛
Thank You Sir Richard!! Thank You for making Space available to anyone!!!
Those dislikes are from the Flat Earthers...
Amazing, this's unbelievable...
What I would give to be able to do this. Hopefully one day it's affordable to all.
ma ravna ploca
over $1 billion dollars spent to get few elites to enjoy space...while there is no talk on its CO2 emissions, impact on the climate, and the need to have such flights. This technology, money, and resource would have been better spent on tackling COVID19 across the world or take care of saving the planet...but hey we must rejoice that the all-powerful can enjoy the space trip!!!
Inspiring
This is fake.. Earth should be flat.. or square.. or pants.
So having wanted Taxpayers money last year to bail his company's out he can now start pissing about in space 🤔
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
And you all claim to be broke.....
We, kerala people, from india proud to say that traveller Santhosh George Kulangara  is a part of this mission.💪💪💪💪
Virgin galactic
No one has a mid-life crisis like Sir Richard!
Wear a mask people
Он хотел в окно выпрыгнуть?)))
I dont believe anything shot with fixed camera
No helmets?
Brilliant!
Kudos to Mr. Brandon for making the impossible possible ⚡️ It takes real humanly courage, teamwork and determination to complete such a endeavors and trust on your machinery to take a ride to the extreme 💌
Waiting to see SGK. മലയാളി ആരും കാണുന്നില്ലേ ഇത്. 😍😍😍
So yet again Branston just showed that crying to the British people because he laid off hundreds of his staff and wanted tax payers money to help him was another joke. Just to help his even richer mates play. What a surprise
Sorry to disappoint you all but man in space was done some 50 years go. Just that this is a private person on a private jet shelling his own money. Making his dream come true . Please reach out to a new galaxy with your all your fortune then it's gonna be a fun ride for life.
Congratulations
cool!
Waiting for Mr Santhosh George Kulangara’s trip with Virgin Galactic
It seems that it's à complete success, in that case why the stock exchange is dropping down ?
Super !  ;))
Reminds me of a drunk taxi drive home from the pub 😅
Didn't reach space tho, you missed the recognized border by about 20km. Sorry to say Bezos will be the first rich douche to do it
Hold my sputnik
If you can do that then what we can do ? Space is end there is nothing beyond that ahahha ..  Hmmm we might swim in Saturn moon water
This is another studio of NASA, earth is flat
SGK❤️ 🇮🇳
I don't think that ship was still Virgin upon "re-entry."
Just curious as to why they were not wearing helmets during entry into space from the mother ship 🤔
Amazing guys!
This looks totally fake
Virgin Galactic not a virgin anymore.
Great Achievement 🤩❤🔥
in one hundred years it will cost $1000, for one trip up and back...
So nobody noticed that the straps for the seat belts are not weightless mainly the ends pulled to tighten or loosen the seat belts. Just saying
Il n'a pas l'air à l'aise du tout le Bee Gees !
so. is it flat? haha
Beginning of the End.
LOL and people will eat this up like WOw!!!!!! a piece of candy........
Probably reminds him of his flight to eppy island
Cool!! Hello to Rogozin.
Flat Earthers: 😱
There won't be to many more generations if we don't save the planet we have. Start using your money and science to change politics and the earth so we have more generations to come, otherwise what's the point.
I give it 6 flights before passengers start getting shamed for the carbon footprint of a trip.
Flat earthers gonna have to get some better mental gymnastics 😂
Now let's see the excuses flat earther's come up with as to why they think the earth is still flat... :')
Eagerly waiting for Mr Santhosh George Kulangara from India to achieve this hights… waiting for that proud moment by 150 Crore people. Santhosh George Kulangara… The Prince of Travelers of Modern India 🇮🇳
Fake, earth is flat

Круто!!!но только акции упали)))
Don't underestimate the power of Virgin people 😂
It is really strange and dangerous, that pilots are accessible to customers. You never know, who can be on board... Or is there any glass?
He says for the next generation to aspire. But when hes takin adrenochromed blood & injecting it into his eye, it sounds like hypocrisy
"If we can do this, just imagine what you can do." There's a lot I could do with billions of dollars! Like eradicating world hunger, getting the covid vaccine to the impoverished and vulnerable, advancing renewable technology... I could do so many things to help the world, all of which are better choice than using tax payer dollars to take a billion dollar joy ride.
The two pilots are wearing oxygen masks but crews are not. Why?
Cool💪👍
Really ... excited ...  then they returned
Brawoooo  marzenua sie spelniaja  i to jakie....ogladanie  ziemi  pieknej ziemi a w kolo bezkresna ciemnosc
I guess the proletariat can't kill the bourgeoisie if they use their money to leave the planet! 🤷‍♂️
the earth not flat!
We are supposed to be cutting back on pollution not creating more just for tourism for the ultra rich! How much CO2 is there from a flight?
И чо?
This is simply EPIC.
ЧТО С АКЦИЯМИ???
Indian like
1:12, 1:39, 1:45 proves earth is flat and they're only using concave lenses in some angles to make the earth round. So to anti-flat earthers.. They didn't really go as far out in space to prove if earth is a ball
I thought the earth was flat 🤔
Sorry but you did not cross the Karman line, you did not go to space. Just because a very rich person flys very very high doesn't mean he gets to redefine science.
0:59 Que fake excited face.
one of the best Simpson episode 😅
1:20 The Indian Flag !!
Waiting for look out the window the earth is flat :)
I'm confused as to why this is amazing.  Technologically its nothing new. Piggy back to the edge of space + controlled descent.  What "innovation" does this represent? How is this going to get us living on the Moon or colonizing Mars etc? Just billionaire BS.
This match took place on the computer.  It's all fiction
I love your fire. 🚀🚀🚀🔥🔥🔥Yuri Gagarin rejoices looking at you from above.
They look very scared and trying to hold a tight clench on anything they can touch
COOL🔥🔥💕👍
Sorry but Jeff Bezos better see what the benchmark is set at right now.
One small step for Branson one giant leap for Virgin Empire
Dont think about environment
Sayna oll❤
The shepard is a penis and the other is a virgin... why
I'm going to show this at the homeless shelter and tell them to try a bit harder.
Humans will soon become space orks
Little .. for that kind of money - VERY little. At least 10-15 minutes of weightlessness - then yes. You can enjoy. And even $3 is a pity for that.
From a dream to a reality- bravo Mr. Branson and all at VG! An equally huge congratulations to humanity for a very important door was just unlocked for us all 🙌
A total waste of valuable energy that will be a playground for the rich and elite.
What a fake….CGI
Always loved this man.
Ok hear me out : imagine having sex on a private spaceship
Flat earth theory proved wrong
The space age has come boys
Di Indonesia masih bicara halal haram
Was not in space. Space is 62 miles above the surface of the earth. see Kármán line, but not some 50-some miles. Richard Branson should be taken behind the woodshed. I guess it would be low-orbit, but not space.
Amazing. Waiting for santhosh George kulangara onboard
I want what they’re having!
Nice flat surface
Is't flat
Just one man doing his bit for global warming
Something something something curve something something cgi something something globetards
This the sugar daddy you fight after you beat all the rest.
And the pollution in this story ?
2:15 First Airpods Pro to ever reach space
To all haters and parabolic theory guys. Even if its parabolic. They had opportunity to see our planet from diffrent and never forget angle, and look on our world from another perspective. Soo put your facts to the pocket and from another one prepare your money. Peace
Didnt GGW do this
And this same guy wanted the UK taxpayer to bail out his airline. 🤔
Why not donate the money to needy, help people in Middle East .... Why this waste of money?
Even for standard plane i couldnt afford one
브랜슨형 유증 머야..ㅠ
Anyone wanna share video or pics of the cockpit funny how this hardly anything or instrument indicating 292,000 feet lmao
when ticket prices come to 500$ than call me.
I wanna see their faces when it releases and fires up
To all the billionaires, could you make something that cleans the earths air next.
Haha this will finally shut flat earthers up. The proof that Earth is a chilli bowl confirmed at 1:37
🙏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏 you beat the Young billionaires
Apparent 0 G! Don't forget the gravitational law of Newton ( F = G m1*m2 / d^2). Pay attention about science concepts..
Ya Allah, sesuatu impian yang akhirnya terwujud, berkat dedikasi dan etos kerja yang solid. Sir Richard Branson  dan para pakar yang luar biasa.  Selamat menikmati keindahan Bumi dari Luar Angkasa ya.
That's one big step for Richard, one waste leap up for mankind.
I’m just so glad you didn’t lose your lunch on camera.Congratulations!
I think they need to move the chairs back so there’s more space lol. And they could use a few handles.
"who farted?"
Space may be the final frontier but it's made in a Hollywood basement
новый батут заработал))
what would happen if u circling earth on space with space ship going faster than earth rotation?  can u cheat time?
Yayyy .3 minutes in space
ami ya me hubiera dado un infarto AJJAJAJAJA
When you have $$$
Now if he could just pay a fair share of taxes we can have some nice things
Why is everyone getting their panties in a bunch over this?  We flew higher in the 60’s.  60 years ago.  But Galactic is bigger and reached 50 miles, that’s space!  B.S.  I love the newspaper article that is astounded they were weightless for 2 minutes.  Lmao.  It’s called falling.  The international space station feels 90% of Earth’s gravity and it is at an altitude of 220 miles.  The only reason they are weightless is because the station is falling while orbiting at 17000mph.  That is mach 22.  Any slower and it will eventually crash into a mountain side. Virgin galactic isn’t even doing mach 2.
Flat Earth believers must be losing their minds.
Wow
Cartoons  They did not go to space  Space is fake. They only went 52 miles up.  If that
I think we should send some flat earthers  up there so they can see with their own eyes
Next flight just got flat earth people trying to prove everyone wrong
You need lot of handles around in your spaceship. Pessangers need grab the seats to fly around..
It’s a glorified fairground ride , until one day they all get killed !
Flat Earthers: ThIs DoEs NoT pRoVe AnYtHiNg
The future already. Man it hit me
You believe this then you believe Musk put a car into space... wake up stupid humans
Branson sounded like Martin luther king jr when he was safely into space lol
Wonder how many Flat Earthers are booking tickets??
Инвалидам колясочникам будут льготы?😂😂😂
Mandem visibly scared
Richard seems to be trying to open a window around the 2 min mark. DON'T DO IT RICHARD!!!
I'm sure this is all great for the environment...
Useless.
Earth sure does round to me
The earth is not flat. Imagine that…..
Normal people don't pass out from that rocket reaching mach 3 is sus
You need more handles on the walls. Also the passengers needs some training as they are crisscrossing and colliding each other in that small space.
Well done Hollywood The earth is flat
Can you please find some flat earthers and take them with you next time. I would love to see their reaction, and try to talk themselves out of what they just witnessed
How many nectar points I need for a seat?
Spaceflight is when you 100 km above Earth. This is suborbital flight.
Lucky bastards got to get a seat next to Branson on the first commercial flight to space.
Bet this guy doesn’t know the price of a loaf of bread or a liter of milk
can ask how much carbon tax are they suppose to pay???
Thank You.
😊😁👏👏👏
One day i will also go to space LIVE TO BE COSMO💉🔬🔭🔭😎😎
The real lines of something you can see in the middle of the lenses, just a hint
that  Virgin  logo  looks  very similar  to    Robocop  vs terminator    game logo    in  snes.  so nostalgic
Way to go!
I just want to see the explosion
Makhluk timur tengah mana bisa melakukan ini 🤣🤪
Congrats Sir Richard Branson, you worked hard to get where you are now. Awesome job. Stay safe
They still using gas to get up there?  🤣😂
The Pilots look like TIE Fighter Pilots! 😂 Now, I want to watch Star Wars!
I though re-entry into Earth’s atmosphere was a violent burning ball of fire type of event. Every capsule, space shuttle, etc. before has had to be equipped with special tiles to keep from disintegrating. This thing appears to be nothing but aluminum and it just came back in with no problem?
Sooooo....its flat right?
Well done sir Richard 😉
Useless things, people need to invest money on betterment of needy people and invest time and energy on finding medicine to cancer and corona treatment. World wide people suffering with minimum things ,these corporate people sadist people wasting time for useless things
waiting for SGK's trip with Richard 😍
View is priceless 👌
Great. The obscenely wealthy have risen to yet another level of conspicuous consumption.  Go humanity. 😑
Sooo cool that Sir Richard partisipates out there in his own space mission. Deepest respect from the Faroe Islands!:)
Wonder if it could make it to the space station some day?
How much carbon monoxide is released in Earth atmosphere to get this monstrosity craft into that part of space? It’s all about making money AGAIN and for what??
Next level of travel vacation , we expect tea shop (2030) 😬
Are tbey weightless from being in space of from a freefall?
Hi
Earty flat
They went below the actual space.....50 miles......they avoided actual burn re entry which is 65 mile.. . ..cheaters
But what about Flat earth? Lol 😂
I seen a ufo
Those are water bubbles!!!! WTF!?!!!???
Is the earth flat?
Thats not true space, just barely reaching the edge,. Same as a airplane doing the gravity trick...for 3 minutes at a time....
so where is UFO?
Kids: try building a ship for the middle class workers.....then you will be the best
But the earth's flat
Tierra plana despierta!!!!!!!!  Suerte !!!!😎
1:21 indian flag
seeing the curve of the earth perfectly span between all the windows really blows flat earthers hats off since curved windows cant pull that kind of deception off.
This is clearly CGI footage edited by NASA because the earth is flat!!!!! People all around the globe knows the truth!!! 😐
Truly amazing. Someone had to take the lead and make this happen. Wonderful to see all of your hard work come to fruition . Congrats team.
I'm sure the Flat-tards are having a field day with this.
Yeah the rich and wealthy wanna escape planet earth for all the food dries up.
Congrats
Earth is flat this is just satanic deception xD
De nuevo un gran engaño👀👀🐸
People who get nervous on planes:  😬
My sympathy goes out to all Flat Earthers who are going to have to learn how to deal with footage like this on a regular basis. :(
k a    b o o m ! ! ! !
Who cares....not everyone is a billionaire...
😄😄😄
Another filthy rich person spending all that money for a couple minute thrill while so many go hungry, homeless, or jobless.  Enjoy!
This proof that The Earth is flat. 😉
Looks pretty round
So? Is the earth flat?
Such a waste of time
So what?…🤡
meh...
Great
Woah... Would love to see space one day♥♥ this is amazing
Now flat earthers can hitch a ride and see for themselves. At least the rich ones.
Look at the earth its flat, I knew it all along. /s
Kinda small space, isn't it...?!
Branson, you’re a PoS as much as Bezos and Musk. You clearly don’t care about helping solve world hunger. Let the kids die he shows.
It’s amazing no doubt, but many don’t realize they are not floating because they broke earths gravity like other astronauts. They are floating because the ship is free falling and they are falling with it.
I wonder how flat earthers will react to this video.  Lol
It's sort of space...
amazing
Congratulations all
Amazing to watch -- BUT -- what about spending $$$ on Earth to defeat Climate Change, Green Energy, etc. instead of just another toy for the ultra-rich?
Who is the diversity hire?
Pilots have oxygen masks but not the crew. Ok..
I was hoping to get a glimpse of just one of the tens of thousands of "satellites" that are in space.  Maybe the video guys that do Bezo's flight, will photoshop one or two in, on the final edit.
There is no limit for imagination proving this video and  feeling excited.
Air bubbles in space ? Or filmed underwater ? The deception is so big !
What no caviar and champagne? Where's the flight attendants? Adults? You look like a bunch of 16 year olds out with daddy's car. Imagine what I can do? Uh I'm not a billionaire and I probably won't be flopping around in space during my lifetime.
Fly me to the moon but it’s taken literally
SGK fans ഉണ്ടോ???  മല്ലുസ്???
so happy that he is inspiring a next generation of dreamers. People dont realize how important it is to have dreams
Congrats to all
news title: Virgin goes to space
Much respect!! One love. One human race.
Fake
Technically it didn't go high enough to be into space. And not really much of an achievement for humanity considering it's just exclusively for the wealthy.
Genuinely happy for Branson. That guy has been working toward this moment for a really long time!
📢 Any Flat earth theorists in the comments, please stand up... ...
Get the f@5k outta here. 😂
The most spectacular scenes......lifetime opportunity
He will be putting up hotels on other planets next. Flights will be delayed or cancelled, and you will never get a refund. 💤💤💤💤💤💤
What about climate change?  How much fuel will be burned so Tom Hanks, Lady Gaga and all the other rich hypocrites can partake?
I can only imagine the feeling he must of felt, what’s the point of having billions of dollars of you’re not going to space with it
amazing...i can only dream of doing this...
FAKE!
Things to entertain the rich and bored.
Imagine the airmiles collected on that flight.  Amazing video.
Finally there's decent footage, without the non working stream and corporate propaganda spewed out by that narrator lady.
Yep. Flat.
FREE FALL NO WEIGHTLESS
awesome! BUT they are all dead is there is a decompression
Thought he was going to open window for some fresh air.
Well done congratulations what an achievement  we are all proud
it seems the line between upper atmosphere and space is mightily blurry
For the significance of what this means to humankind, I hope this gets more views than a pop artist video. Congratulations!
Wow. Incredible. Well done Richard Branson.
Inspirational point ,when Branson told he dreamt in his childhood and now he fulfilled his desire by getting into space!
My vomit would be floating all over the place.  I get dizzy on a carousel.
This only benefits the rich. On the earth itself they are still many poor people who are not able to feed themselves. What a cruel world!! 😢
🤘🏼😎🤘🏼   👍🏼👊🏼
Went to space just to play 🤣
S.O.S CUBA
Absolutely insane. When can I pilot this?
PRivate companies: "We're making civilian spaceflight cheaper and more practical. Eventually, we plan on going to Mars." US Government:  "We went to the Moon 50 years ago. Now we ask the Russians to help us send a box of dried fruit into space."
BEWARE OF CHINESE COPIERS..
Not real. Earth is flat.
Sot his is what virgin mobile is wasting our money on  While they go out and take selfies, I have a shitty connection everywhere I go  Why don't you put up more satélites so we can all have more than 2g
This is really amazing.
Well done though Mr. Branson. In so happy for you and your team's amazing accomplishments! Incidentally, I'm also very happy for ME, and what your success means to me as a passenger and fellow space enthusiast! I always knew we could do it. Congratulations again! I'll see you up there.  To infinity, and beyond!
I can't help but think of all the people that are struggling on planet earth that could have been helped with the money this stupid stunt cost.  A total waste of money.
For what?
I wonder how much the pilot of that prop powered plane (seen outside the window at the end of this video clip 3:13) would charge for a ride?
If I paid a lower tax rate than the people I employ on minimum wage, I’d probably fly to outer space too……. Out of complete shame.
This is so freaking cool
This is not space.
I am so happy for you Sir Richard, you have worked so hard and so long to make this day possible and you thoroughly deserve it as does your team. Thank you for making dreams possible for at least some people. I'll need to win lotto but there's always that chance where before there was none.
It's FLAT
They thought of everything.   Except for handles by the windows.
Why I see air bubble on 1:35
Emergency exit ?
Why I see air bubble on 1:28
Imagine paying to go on that ride and not looking out the window. Embarrassing
Guy just did this from a weather balloon for a 1000 bucks
Lol how is it so much curvature from that low in the sky lol CGI high altitude balloons from the same height shows no curvature lol
See the fakeness when he was looking looking out the window? Lmao.  How could the planet earth move so incredibly fast that the stars behind it are revealed ?   Or does the camera and lil space ship move that fast?   Uhhhh no
Amazing event in history, Aloha from Hawaii Richard. Because of time dilation we saw the re-entry 12 hours before the actual re-entry.
Do you have lots money  $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ you to can go up if your are  rich
Who cares?
Jesus can change your life bro ♥️✝️
Would somebody please put some perspective to this. This was not a space flight. They didn't even get close. The edge of space is 100K meters or some 328K feet. They only got to 282,000 feet. All this was, was a high flying airplane ride, albeit, and expensive one. This was false advertising at it's best. So, stop calling it history making. They did this back in the 60's. I want to scream when I hear all the cheering by the media about this.
Man, all that just to be in space for 1 minute? Should be a half hour minimum. I'm sure they have limited oxygen and all that, I'm just sayin'
Another Great Leap for mankind !!!
Flat Earther: “Nice CGI Liars”
The disliked people still say that the earth is flat lol 🤣
Congratulations!!
Isaiah 14:12-22
Any flat-earthers in here?
That is not really something special at all... The know how to fly to space is already there. All you need is cash to make it possible.
So cool
Routine spaceflight to future space stations doesn't seem far off now. Thanks to people like Richard.
Wonder if they are thinking of all the poor and starving people in the world whilst they are playing up there for a few mins at a cost of millions?  Doesn’t seem right does it?
I mean the earth looks pretty flat...                        It's a joke relax
Always not enought image of flat earth
I’m sad I’m a generation too early to be able to one day try this experience. 🚀👨‍🚀
hoax
Will that count towards my frequent flier miles?
I just offered $1 for this on priceline. Hope i get it.
Cool
Is the goal of Virgin Galactic simply to send rich people to space for 10 mins and return?
To bad he didn't actually go to space.  But whatever helps him sleep at night.
Hhhhmmmmmmm🤔🤔🤔🤔
its like glitching out of gta
Fake space flight.
Liberals hate this
No space suit?
Bet as kids people told them they couldn’t go to space
out of space with parachutes!  really?
what is right with this?...i will wait...
so you spend millions of dollars to flip over yourselves? really? and no air tanks? wtf?..
It’s Hollywood made it’s fake
People dont understand how amazing this is. Humans just flew to space and back, FOR FUN! I cant wait to see what this can become in the future.
if they can fake a spinning  globe Earth, they can fake anything. you been faked. again.
Rich people are definitely going to leave the planet and live in space in the not so far future.
I thought that we went to the moon last century, what’s so amazing about 50 miles, 60 years later… not even a mile per year.
Audius & Telcoin
And look!  No masks!  OK, are they all going to get covid now?  Somehow--I don't think so.  And neither would you likely if everyone went maskless on a regular commercial flight.  Speaking from Realityland.
How come the pilots wear masks and the crew doesn't..just in case they lose pressure at least the pilots don't die
He looks nervous or anxious as hell
I’m so proud of this achievement
The memes are gonna be wild
I would love to see a GoFundMe page crop up, funding this trip for a leading flat earther. Now that’s TELEVISION.
Dream big until you can prove yourself and achieve your big dream. I always wanna go to the moon thats why i smoke moon rocks💪💪💪
I see this as the end of space exploration and the new era of space exploitation beginning. A new playground for a new crop of overprivileged sociopaths. If you get far enough away from the planet you don't have to look at all that messy starvation and those pathetic little humans suffering in dire need. It's such a downer!
Would've sucked if they couldn't get back to Earth's atmosphere and just wandered off in space
People as Bernie Sanders have their souls pulled down by gravity.
Don't let this guys fool you, that is not space, they are just doing a really long free fall, maybe the longest one ever... They are not even near space, that ship can't stand atmosphere re-entry friction.   Vaccinated fools arguing in 3,2,1...
Simply fantastic! Bravo!!!
1:38... FLAT!!
*Just imagine if he  see some aliens there oh yeah*
Am not flat earther but look at that curve lol
And what value does this bring, its just an expensive carnival ride. Sorry not that big a deal.
Why do the pilots wear masks and the passengers don’t?
I was kicked in the face at school 25 years ago for saying I wanted to be the first kid from my school to go to space. Split my face like a cut watermelon. At least it’s now an accessible reality for my kids. Amazing.
Something about this feels really bizarre and slightly unsettling, but I can't put my finger on what.
FLAT
fake
Vomit comet!
Awesome ! 😎👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Looked like ole boy was tryin to open the window for a second thatta made the news
BOY THAT WOULD OF BEEN NICE TO SEE A BIG BOOM .INTO THIN AIR
To all the flat earth retards,  Earth is a globe, when I was flying to Europe the plane I was on went up to 66000 feet in the air.  At that height you can see the curvature of the Earth.  It was a surreal experience.
helluva rolling start
They did film this in Hollywood right? XD
Next time, aim for the sun.   You don't pay taxes, you mooch off the taxpayers, and you use our money for your space toys.  Buzz off.   Eat the Rich!
me next!
Wow! Accomplished what the X-15 did 58 yrs. ago! ( didn't get the altitude though). At this rate in 50 yrs. we'll celebrate another self absorbed billionaire flying a bi- plane over kitty hawk.
Bleeping waste of money. Fools
I thought everyone was worried about global warming.  Burn rocket fuel..CLOSE THE PIPELINES FOR POOR AMERICANS.
Awsome!!!! Congrats!!!!
I want to see an interior faces of them,when the rocket starts(FIRE)🚀. LoL I thought he was trying to get outside for Space Walk🤣🤣
Amazing 👍✌️All d best virgin team😍From India 🇮🇳
I was put off some by the VG broadcast.  Ripoff from SpaceX and talking about this as a platform for scientific experiments is a bit much.  Can you grow tadpoles or do other microgravity experiments in minutes?  We have the ISS and orbital platforms that can do real microgravity science, but not this joy ride!
He should have said something profound and memorable to meet the occasion, instead of that blabbering nonsense.
Absolutely incredible. Ever since I was a young kid it was always my dream to go up into space. And now we have commercial flights. Sadly I'll never be able to afford a trip on Galactic :(
Richard seems scared lol. Looked like he didn't want to remove his safety belt.
Dunno bout u but the earth looks pretty flat. 😆
Disappointed you didn't leave Branson up there.
Why I see air bubble on 0:41
YOUR SPECIES WILL END SOON
He beat Bezos
Why see air bubble on 1:15
Why I see air bubble on 0:55
AMAIZING !!! 17 YEARRRSSSS!!! Wonderful idea , great project. Cant imagine how difficult is the way to  approach this dream. Bravo Humans!!! Bravo !! You are all motivating us to not give up to not stop dreaming.  Thank you very much!
Flat Earthers be like... That curve is Photoshopped... 🤣
Why I see air bubble on 0:41
Nobhead  , dicking about in space but his company can’t get my internet working.
Imagine going to space a billionaire but still being a virgin smh
The look on there faces says it all
1.6k dislike from Amazon and Alibaba.
Space was a paid actor.
While the earth burns, billionaires play in space.
Bull 💩
I am Gladvto be alive to see such of great accomplishment! Congratulations Branson ! I always been a great fan of yours!!! Awesome
Found the heaven?
Please don't grab at the rubber window seal.
Congratulations Virgin Galactic, this is truly a wonderful milestone in manned private spaceflight!
Sooooo no re-entry damage huh?
Man has a childhood dream. Literally spends his whole life chasing that dream. In the process of making that dream a reality, he employs thousands of people, making their lives better. The discoveries he’s made in the process has given all of mankind hope for the future of our species. He’s inspired the youth and promoted imagination and interest in being  a part of something bigger than yourself.   CNN - Richard Branson’s disappointing, suborbital, space jaunt polluted our environment.  While at the same time saying nothing about the thousands of commercial flights that do the same thing day after day. 🙄
Where's Jeff bozo?... 👀 Oh wait he's hiding somewhere on earth 🌎 😅🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Finally! How long has been talking about this?
The universe is mostly black
Instead of burn lot of gaz for only 4 people playing during 2 minutes... Virgin Galactic should care our planet... This video is so sad...
surely no one uys this garbage..UNITY , haha
To all you flat Earthers out there.  I’m so sorry but world is in fact round
How is this different from the X-15 program of the 60's? Both were a plane-like design, both were launched from a plane and both reached suborbital altitude (with many of the X-15 flights reaching greater altitudes than the Virgin Galactic). Hardly a "galactic" performance.
It looks so flat
History made.  Hats off to Sir Branson
Would have liked to see them pushed back in seat during acceleration at launch
Well done I think we need research to carry on and to fly deeper. 👍😃
It took so long because he was like I want blue paint that will withstand this speed so people can see it says Virgin on the bottom.
Now the flatearthers
👍
How much does it cost for the few seconds space flight?
The internationally agreed limit to space is 100 kilometers, or 62 miles, so he did NOT go to space, just the upper atmosphere. Close, but no cigar.
Any flat earthers care to explain?
An accident waiting to happen
Space Peds , taking children to space where there are no laws . Epstein would have been proud of his former friends and passengers .
Amazing. Congratulations. However I wish people spent their energy to really change the world, to eliminate poverty and hunger, than building another super toy for freaky billionaires. Just think about it next time.
$250K for that, yeah right..
Bro I'm not dying til I go to space
WELL DONE to YOU well done  Best regards
Amazing profit margins...
I personally am quite pleased that we are about to start firing celebrities into space
Meanwhile they bang on about climate change and saving the planet, takes the piss out of average people
Remember this people! This will be the milestone that we look back at & say………. That’s where we began to truly explore the cosmos
get your butt on mars! total recall 😎
Same thing Mustang drivers think happens, in their heads, when they floor the accelerator!😂
The UFOs are probably wondering, what's all the fuss about??? We do this everyday.
So stinkin cool!   I’m a retired corporate pilot and this impresses me. What an experience it must have been.
millions of dollars just for the fun of a billionaire
How is gravity weak enough to allow people to float around while their in LOW EARTH ORBIT, yet strong enough to not keep the Moon tidally locked at 240K miles? This footage is so fake it’s unbelievable anybody would think it’s genuine.
Well done RB, you have just made getting to space look so easy, it will inspire so many, im all ready thinking 3 - 4 million to deliver a payload up to space, is peanuts. Scale that up to drop from something bigger, this is space station transportation service , for sure. from humble beginings selling records from a canal boat.
Looks as dodgy as everything beardie des
Wonder if they can serve a Sealed Inditement in SPACE!!!!!!
The world is a show 😉
0:50 I love my India. 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳. Feeling proud. Thank you dear.
Wow.
I rather buy a PS5 right now. That will make me happy. In fact why don’t Richard send me one. If he can afford the fuel for the rocker a ps5 will be candy money to him.
The Earth is flat 🗺
I am wondering what is Flat Earther gonna do next
Рогозин, вы хоть в стихах событие увековечьте  !
All billionaires should be shot into space to geht rid of them! But please beyond earth gravity!!! Lets start with Bezos and Gates! Then Schwab and the political helpers!
Branson should’ve said “ To all those flat earthers out there, it’s a globe!”
Don’t believe this. Fake.
Why is the earth flat from that high?
At least I was here 🌚
Muito impressionada, acho que já assisti à esse vídeo pelo menos cinco vezes 🤩
Rich boys don't need to take private trips to space that's for astronauts and scientists not .com assholes
That is actually kinda amazing. Weightless and blackness outside.
Wenn 4 von 720 Bundestagsabgeordneten überführt korrupt sind, dann entspricht das einer Inzidenz von 555,55. Wenn weiter 50 Abgeordnete als korruptionsverdächtig getestet werden, dann haben wir eine Inzidenz von 6.944,44. Rechnet Mal nach, es stimmt!!!  Sofort das gesamte Politsystem in den Lockdown!!! Merkt Ihr jetzt wie lächerlich Angies Forderungen an die Deutschen sind??
Круто!
Was he seriously trying to pull off the window seal?
I wish I am still alive when space flight is affordable for a average person like me
welcome to space,     ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah
It's too bad they dont actually reach low earth orbit.  I mean its cool, but this is essentially doing the same thing that those parabolic flights do.
while poor ppl across american can hardly feed their kids, billionaires take a (2 years worth of food for thousands of people) dollar joy ride.
Congratulations and proud of you Sirisha Bandla 👏👏👏
While this is really cool, that’s way too short of floating time. They need at least 30 minutes for it to be even remotely worth while.
Looks very similar to Mars , Not a straight answer ‘nasa’ and also what are the rocks hitting the ship
Not seeing any comments from the flat earthers about being wrong lol.
Every planet is uninhabitable except for Earth. Can’t we just stick to bungee jumping?
Now I know what its like to fly in space:
Sooo cool that Sir Richard partisipates out there in his own space mission. Deepest respect from the Faroe Islands!:)
Wow‼ well done Richard!! ❤💪
They went up only as high as They could. No one can travel past that. It is impossible. The earth is flat and protected by the firmament aka the van allen belt
Oh look, it's curved. Didn't see that coming 😆
So what ? It is boriiing
I thought they were concern about the GLOBAL WARMING!  Perhaps not anymore. Does anyone know how to calculate: How much oxygen this rocket burned to get there?
How long do they have to burn upwards?
Those must be some super wealthy passengers lol.
The 2nd private flight Luda and ty was 1st!!
Eventually,  it's actually happening public space flights in new era space race. I really hope it all explode exponentially and maybe one day we all will afford this incredible opportunity. 🚀🚀🚀
How was epstein Island richard?
They cut out the most interesting part, the reentry...
For the next team of dreamers, take it up another notch - ONE FULL ORBIT
i want to know whos filming all those moments?
Flat "Earthers" be like - dang, well what's next?
Et il y a des gens qui meurent de faim dans le monde , ecoeurant
AirPods seen space before me😪
Wow Wow Wow!!!! No words.
Congratulations to virgin galactic and all the team behind it for this incredible feat! I can't wait to see more. We officially live in the future
A different world to the world of homelessness, families living in temporary housing, food banks and rising child poverty in the UK .
I would have loved to see the re-entry footage
I hope the impostor is onboard
Dont like this... Dont know why
Things may be impossible at the current time. But in time they may be possible. There is many things we ad humans don't understand. We would be pretty stupid to believe we have a vast or major knowledge of the universe.
Go humanity!
Pay your tax Richard
LOL they barely touched space, this is an insult to all the real astronauts up there.
👍
not in space, 20 km from it..
I’m sorry but rich folk blasting into orbit when people starve is not a great thing. Feed the world make all people equal. Your rich play toys are very impressive but empty of love. Shame Richard b. Shame.
Hey Richard can you see the homeless camps from space?
Lots of noise and banging you don't hear in space 0 gravity ?
So dumb
It's only for rich folks , I wish the government can give opportunity for some of us, I will be the 1st person showed up
how about feed the children... feed the world? seems like the rich want to leave earth and let us the poor stay.
The brown girl looked really scared.
Congrats Richard! It's a dream come true!
Tisztelt Uram! Szolgálatra jelentkezem!
Technically out of earth's atmosphere? Also give me one full orbit around the earth and then ill be amazed.
Dream come true! Only 60 years after the federal government a private company reaches semi orbit while asking the federal gov for only a small bailout of $10 billion USD
Amazing what you can do when avoid taxes
That's crazy
Weight is a major factor. If it costs 28 million to buy a ticket for a 70 kilogram person, how much would it cost to bring a 1 kilogram bottle of champagne?
Flat-earthers, earth isn't flat because we went out an took a fucking video.
Flat-earthers everywhere having a seizure
Seems more like an expensive freefall flight that gives off the appearance of being in outer space.  Nose tilts Down: "quick everyone do Flippy flips and spins before we gotta stop freefalling."
"This is too unbelievable" - Sir Richard Branson during the Virgin Galactic hoax
Well done Richard! One for us poms.
Love you Richard❤
Looks pretty flat to me
enough money spent on this that could of fed like half the population in this country.   Aren't you all tired about billionaires that do all this?  But don't spend a dime in taxes nor help Americans.
They are preparing the herd for "aliens" and "space travelling"! That's cool... !keep them entertained 🤣
It's a shame a window didn't go out we can use less billionaires
If everyone got the chance to experience this...they may realise the triviality of stuff human kind are stressing over.
I'm here for all the flat earthers to explain the hidden wires and CGI of the round earth.
Burt Rutan
How long are they up there??
Ok… now gotta wait 100 years at least until normal people can do this as an average travel….
We have space bubbles ladies and gentlemen. I absolutely love space exploration from a giant swimming pool!
First step in getting into space. Get rich by conning out peoples money 💸
Sir Richard was always meant to take risks
This is so awesome......I just want them to answer me 1 question and that's all. Was the earth flat or round (oblate spheroid) while they were up there and looking down. That way this matter can be put to rest.
Congrats branson team.  That was awesome.
You should go to Space again this Friday!   This will show how easy is for @VirginGalatic to go to space. 😎
Wtf its called free fall they fly up shut off the engines and free fell and that they sell u as space and weightlessness and they all had parachutes brain dead
Another luxury that rich a-holes can have while the rest of us are treading water. Yay!
❣️
Rich people in space, is there anything else we need done on this rock aside from that?
"To all the dreamers down there, if we can do this today, just imagine what you can do tomorrow, if you have a spare 500k lying around"
its a free fall, they are not in space and not even near the edge of space which requires 266,000 feet and they are just reaching 55,000 and going into free fall to archive "weightlessness"
Normaly all technology which touch earth  been stoped immediatly for all countries because in few time's by this all equipement's in the sky are going to distroyed a protection earth and make end of live .normal y all président of world stop immediatly .you alger's
2:19 the first attempted window opening in space ;-)
2021/07/13給未來的我：我要從今天開始存250000美金，在我死前一定也要去一次太空！
Эх! Ну что тут, только порадоваться можно, молодцы 👍
Flatearthers where are you?
Батут работает
So cool. Branson has lived a dream!
Pay your taxes leach.
Humanity will remember you for this...
Not convinced looks fake to me
Love how they don't show the onboard footage of it dropping and the rockets firing. They probably crapped their pants
This is so cool, but I still think it would have been funny if a U-2 pilot would have pulled up side and, Sup !
In most shots of the horizon of the earth, the horizon is straight as an arrow... but truly there is a curve there, you just can't see it because it's a fake curve, not a real curve. I guess some of the cameras had a fish eye lens on it others didn't, whoopsie. The earth is flat with a fake curve at the same time lol.
Eu sou o comentário em Português que vc tava procurando!!
Interesting, at least they weren't carrying a mouse like Elon.  You know many balloons have carried cameras 110,000 feet up (20 miles) before exploding and bringing back the evidence.  And why don't they need thermal plates like the space shuttle does to RE-ENTRY!?
Too bad it didn't look like this live. Looked like it was filmed on a potato!! Bezos will do it a lot better and everyone will be able to watch live instead of edited after.
It's one thing to go see Star Wars at the movies, it's quite another to see it in real life!
INSPIRING
Wonderful
Reach for the Stars! ☀️💛
1:46 fish-eye lense
The tickets are about to be booked. I always wanted to go. Soon ❤️❤️
Flat earthers are dying inside right now!!
Congratulations! Well DONE!! Just Amazing!!! That's my dream - to go to SPACE. And I will make it happens!! ❤️❤️❤️
Where does so called space start ? Wake up parrots!
like neil tyson said when the guy jumped from space. if you were to scale the earth down to a globe. they are less than a mm above the surface technically thats not space yet, but great job.
Amazing how far and how fast we’ve gotten to this point, I use to dream about stuff like this.
Amazing!
Stay.
Lets not forget Branson wanted £500 million from the uk government to furlough his aircrew staff. I love the technology and whats made possible....But Branson i can do without.
And this guy was wanting fulough through the pandemic!!! What a joke there kids dying and he’s wasting money like this!!! Joke!
Number 50 in education, but can build a giant space station and space jets to shoot this guy 80 miles above the earth.
Fake
Its fucking disgusting how rich some people are to benefit nobody but themselves blowing up in space
Everything is possible. When you're a billionaire. (angry noises in $4k per year for family of three in borderline third world country)
What an expensive toy
I see the flight-crew are helmeted. Why none for the passengers?
When i go to space in like 40 years imma remeber this comment
Bravo! Well done you all!
Knowing that outer space starts at the Kármán line, some 62 miles above planet's surface - does hardly touching Mesosphere (53 miles) qualifies for a 'Trip in Space'? Answer: DEFINITELY NOT!   Virgin Galactic DID NOT fly in OUTER SPACE!
I wish there was a day when i was young, I was not called stupid or you will never. From one learning challenged person congratulations! I eventually learned I had a voice and I am not dumb.
Great CGI
You have done nothing to save Earth.  There are two plastic monsters in the pacific ocean. Did you see them from your rich kid spaceship window ?
THE EARTH IS FLAT!
Billionaires and their toys.
only for  2 sec 282,000 feet not even really in space what's the point?
Flat earther:  hollywood film actors.
Congrats to making it to fake space!
Would have been nice if they took a shisha pot
This looks amazing! Only one thing I didn't like was how easy it was for Richard to move the rubber lining around the window.. At one point in a close up shot, you can see him reach for the window and the rubber edging moves far too easily for my liking! 2:15
Well he did it, congratulations.   Hope the elite will pay for the carbon dioxide and nitrogen emissions by planting enough trees for every ‘space flight’
I'm no expert but it looked safer than the shuttle.
Amazing simply amazing great job look forward to more space exploration into the future.
INB4: Flat earthers say this is all CGi... lol
The internationally recognized altitude of space is the Kármán line at 62 miles, so no, they didn't really go to "space." But it still looks like fun.
The sable bay unintentionally bump because comic conceivably explain via a ethereal machine. profuse, superficial crawdad

"To all you kids down there, I was once a child with a dream. Looking up to the stars. Now I am an adult in a spaceship with lots of wonderful adults. Looking down to our beautiful beautiful Earth. To the next generation of dreamers if we can do this just imagine what you can do."   - Richard Branson
Can finally stop this internet nonsense of flat earth and return to a society of science and fact rather than rhetoric and opinion
That‘s quite cool
Amazing! I'm so jealous of them!
הבנאדם פשוט השראה למה שניתן לעשות בעזרת הרוח האנושית. הוא לא מוותר עד שזה קורה.. כבוד ואהבה מישראל
So seeing as this is purely for space tourism and for the ultra rich, how does this benefit the planet? How much Co2 does this rocket put out so you can just float about for fun?
India flag spotted!! Jai Hind!
So Richard Branson actually finally did it, he actually finally made all he said come true. Well done Richard on seeing it through to the accomplishment. It sure took a long time but you made it.      CONGRATULATIONS!
It's called freefall and greenscreens
Если очень захотеть, можно в космос полететь!:)
Truly awesome...keep it up!
Is this the same **** that was asking the UK government to bail out his planes during covid last year?
Love this speechless 😶😍
That's amazing
I told you earth was square
А че все упало то по акциям?(
Pity they let him come back
Did anyone else notice they have a lot of shots looking at machine on the outside from about 100ft away? And then right next to it when they are to re-enter? Was there another spacecraft and film crew went up right beside them to film all of this? And as they just re-entered there was a thumbs up from crew but looking out the window there was plane flying next to it. I didn’t think planes could fly almost in space?
Surprise how reaching
You people are so gullible!  There is no space.  We were never on the moon. This is CGI! We cannot leave the earth!
Climate change likes this video
What have the flat earthers got to say about this then?!
is these people who destroy our planet.  they are nasty people who are only interested in profits.  He also had to say that he was going to open a fund to give free travel.  do you know why?  Of course you don't need to be an astronaut.  7 billion people go to space... they should be ashamed to think about profits.
Disgustingly self-indulgent....the planet is burning ... let's help it.
2:17 when you open the window for some fresh air
Is it me or does the lady, who can't close her mouth, reach for something at 1:23! A rope maybe!!
I got that high in college once.
I Must say that is just toooooooooo koooooool!!!
I got next.
All the bootlickers in the comment section.. no wonder billionaires get away with everything.
Ahhh money....
Amazing, the earth is round!
Fake
wonderful to be able to experience that so much, once weightless and to see the view of the earth in perspective. A dream to experience this for yourself, congratulations on your success and on the next step into the future
Definitely an "E" ticket ride!
Beautiful images and a triumph for technology, but why not invest everything in a better  world, for people and nature.
it's incredible 👏👏👏🚀🥳
100% my motivation as an entrepreneur. I simply can’t settle for an income that even with meticulous saving and investing just won’t give me the resources to 1) Take part in the dawn of commercial space travel and 2) innovate something of my own that I can share with the entire world!  Time to get to work
That's not space, space is at 100km Karman
Not only Sir R. Branson but also global hunger levels have skyrocketed. Everyone has its own dream and a bowl of rice may be one of them.
Just here to see if there's any comments from the flat earth community 😂
So much for the flat-earth. No disrespect of course...
Zero G plane
I miss the comforting sounds of NASA in the background (beep). Let's move onwards.
Молодцы! "плоскоземельщиков" туда отправьте, посмотрим как они тогда запоют.
flatearth : CGI 😏
I don't get it. Why everyone is so excited for what had been done in1961 already?
Looks impossible to strap yourself back in properly Dickie, come on you numpty!
Just like Steve Jobs presenting the first IPhone, Richard Branson will be the symbol for where space travel for paying customers started.
Time to boink in space baby!
Wow. Just… Wow!
Didn't this guy start off by selling potatoes from a wheel barrow ? Amazing
Молодцы)
Wait, so it's not flat? LOL.
goodwork
Oh the flatearthers are going to LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE this!!! Is that.....curvature???? No......no it can't be.......its special effects!
Looks pretty flat to me…😏
From the man requesting tax-payers money last year, he obviously had some left in the kitty
Those views of planet Earth are stunning
MEH
Why's he wear sun glasses in the space craft 🤔
Spaceflight ? ha-ha-ha 80km is not space
I wish someone would of said “Hey! I can see my house from here.” 😆
I literally got tears in my eyes from happiness watching this!! I've always wanted to go into space, ever since i was little kid. Congrats mister Branson!
This man and Musk are modern day Thomas Edison's & then some.
This is the guy that was begging our government for handouts recently.  Hopefully the government helped him out i hate to see people struggling
that was awesome but it was waaaay too short.... you need to make the ride an hour or more...
Usa
So it's not flat then?
Why are we so obsessed with space? Spend resources on fixing our planet 🌎, fix poverty fix totalitarianism then obsess with something as unimportant as space
BILLIONS of Dollars WAISTED on this Stupid JOY Ride for the Rich!! Think how many Starving people on this Planet could of been feed with this money!!  This Branson Idiot isn't proving Anything!! The Human race already knows how to go to Space!!!!
अविस्मरणीय क्षण आहे..... मानवाने चंद्रावर पहिले पाऊल टाकले तो क्षण आणि हा क्षण अंगावर शहारे आणणारी घटना आहे... सर्वांनाच हार्दिक शुभेच्छा...
Earth is flat!! No is convexa, no no is côncava. Kkkkk
The view is fantastic sure, but this literally costs $200,000... is that REALLY worth it honestly?
Amazing, not a single snarky or critical comment, censors in da house.
The earth is flat :)
but stil earth looks flat.
So cool.
been asking for this, Is it hot in space??
This is not "the space"!!! Check it out! In any case well done!
Hahahahahahah 1:00...every1 is enjoying space entry by floating and Richard Branson is busy doing his "One small step on the moon..." moment speech. Pilots be like hurry up Branson we gotto make re-entry in next 15 secs.
Def the earth is flat can't you see
That was amazing...😍😍😍
Wonder why they didn't show the inside of the fuselage on reentry and launch?
He kept his sun glasses on the whole time, lol.......
Disgusting
Search on youtube by "Virgin Galactic Live Podcast".  Someone is using your name to advertise. Those channels have nothing to do with you. I made a complaint, maybe you do too.
Is he still on Furlough?
Plot twist: They’re in a Hollywood studio
Thanks! my life has gotten much better out of the sudden! 90% of the people who are watching this will not be able to get on these flights because you are poor. Get happy! :)
This is silly, it's an aeroplane, they are not in space they are high up yes but not in space sorry
In the end. We all are kids. It's overwhelming to watch this.
Are they wearing Parachutes? 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I got next!
Pretty cool
You can stay up there for ever Brandy
Am I the only one seeing particles coming off the spacecraft? Potential space trash.
Pusing kuy diputer puter
They need some hand holds on the interior to help move around during weightless.  I'm an engineer, hire me Virgin ! HaHa, wrote this before looking through comments, many are saying the same thing, clearly an issue !
Yep... the earth is flat
The guy who is or was a “Climate Warrior” and fought against Global Warming is now causing it by blowing holes in the OZONE LAYER, LMFAO
Flat earthers 😆
Nice one Richard. You can look down and see the planet you're helping to destroy with your airline.
Mr. Branson, next step, convert that spacecraft into a flying low orbit hotel. Lots of money! Then maybe we can have a whole fleet conducting quick tours of moon in some years. Children will go to moon on field trip. Yes!
Gotta hand it to him this is phenomenal
Who cares. Big waste of money, greed and ego. Btw, can do this anytime on the decades old NASA “vomit comet”. So who cares?
Take that flat earthers..!!!!
The decadency of capitalism in terminal stage
Love how the man who made this happen is holding on for dear life the whole time. LMAO. 🤣😂
Looking down on a beautiful earth we are ravaging on daily basis 😂😂😂
My Money 💸💸💸📉😞🥺😫😩😣😥😢
what was the apoapsis and the highest speed?
Where are the flat earthers at??
Richard Branson is so inspiring!
A billionaire telling us all “keep dreaming, you too could do this”  No Richard, just no.
“Unbelievable“ indeed. I hope our billionaires realise that the Earth is our only home and we have to preserve it.
Brilliant Well done Virgin team …. First of many steps  Stuart in ireland
Maybe Branson will find his mate Jeffrey Epstein up there!
Fake!….it’s just a pararabole….
when everything is automated virgin still using pilots to control their spacecraft and all the mission seems to be too ridiculous
Who cares if he was in space it’s not like anyone will be able to ride into space unless you have a million dollars for the trip …
Only a few seconds of zero g manoeuvre before strapping back into seats LOL .. don't be fooled people..
50 miles up
This is the man who wanted a government bailout for his air line,
Omg...the earth is flat!!
Hahaha…aaaahhh Bazos….take THAT bro…
Wow.. 😍😍😍
Jumping inside a vertically falling airplane has nothing to do with what so called space and it’s physics. Simulating such environment and claiming it’s the “space” is the dumbest thing I have ever seen in my life.
Well done. But space is 100km up, not 92. Keep living the dream.
❤️🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳❤️
Very cool...is the re-entry as dangerous as for the space shuttle?
Maximum grift. When you make it to orbit, we'll talk again.
Nothings impossible if youre a billionare
Congratulations Sir Richard !
Am poor.but i'll love to take a space flight.please richard
Cringe
I am just a caveman, but isn't this the edge of space? Not space, space.
So cool man. Awesome
Mr Branson, now you're in an euphoric mood is there any chance of cutting my Virgin media bill please? Congratulations on a magnificent feat👍
His speech got me, really, "To the next generation of dreamers" we are only starting to discover
More like Virgin Atmospheric.
Incredible that
The Earth IS Flat: 1:40 / 3:12 ....Nice Design on the Space Ship.... When is the next flight and the price of tickets?
Lots of happy faces. Wish i was on that flight
Curvature is changing from a ball to concaved earth lol give me a break
this is such a big deal! it should be all over the news rather than which celebrity got together or separated from who & other nonsense ... so kids & ppl are more interested & invested in science & tech
✨
I also saw space in my dreams going on cycle
Pay your fucking taxes
Never even went into space. Missed it by two miles. Not zero g, just an in officiant parobolic tragectory. We have been doing this in fairgrounds for over 100 years. You silly tossers.
Billionaires can fly to space but can’t pay their workers a living wage. Figures.
No lo se rick
Tesla who?? 😂😂
2:18 I thought Branson was trying to open the window up! 😆😆
Nicely done! The galactic future starts from here!
High-flying air balloons reach those exact heights.  Same camera used and the same lens.  Stop bull shittttting us.
Awesome zero g plane .
RICHARD BRANSON IS IN THE HISTORY BOOKS! GUINESS WORLD RECORD! HE'S AMAZING! BAD AZZ VIDEO!
Did it cost the same for RB to go briefly into space as the amount he applied for government funding for furlough pay? Or was it twice as much? Meaning he could have, in theory, paid his staff twice over and not had a nice little flight with a view? Just curious
So this is where the money the NHS is missing out on is going
2:15 Nice AirPods product placement :)
1:21 she is indian
Suborbital is booooooring!!!!
Why haven`t astronauts been to the Moon in 50 years, it seems very strange. Advances in tech should have made journey easier and safer?
Quite an achievement but more of a well executed publicity stunt than anything else. SpaceX is the real innovator.
Richard Branson. The bloke that asked the British tax payers to bail out Virgin Atlantic whilst tax dodging himself. What a c*ck!
Captain Picard said "Things are only impossible until they are not."
Apple airpods went to space 02:15
So the earth is still looking flat up there.
Hes a genius
👌
There you have it. Finally a way to kick all those rich self serving pricks off this rock. Let the et's have em
Imagine going all the way up in to space to experience the most amazing views of earth you could ever ever ever imagine and you are wearing sunglasses 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
congrats Guy's looks amazing, wish had the cash to get up there, but for more than 10 min :D
They shoulda taken a flat Earther with them to shut them up once and for all
Oh my gosh! Billionaires in space! Who would have imagined rich people going to space lmao! Dumb!
Already very tired of all the air time being wasted on this. Bezos and Branson can hardly be equated with being the Wright brothers.
Beautiful. What an amazing feat. Thank you to all the entrepreneurs, scientists, mathematicians, and every person who had part in making this happen. To the stars!
Welp, we can clearly see the earth is not spinning.
Ayyy
this is so stupid, to be weightless, you need an old scrappy cargo plane and an exact trajectory to simulate this… what experience is that, to be 2 minutes weightless? or abowe some hight? why? what did you achieve? I value an 2 days climb on an 3.500 m mountay way more than this… so called space flight, embarasing
Where are the delusional flerfs now?
Chavs in lower earth orbit.. What next?
so so so cool!
I understand that the flight is so short, otherwise no ordinary person could afford that in their lives. It's still long enough to get some minutes of microgravity and a great look at the Earth. Seriously though, how much is that quick space flight?
I quite like Branston pickle.
Why is nobody screaming. Everyone so quite...
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Pointless cash flash. Remember you can achieve anything, no matter how pointless if you have the millions. 😂
Улыбки какие то искусственные, как будто подчинённые стараются улыбаться на все деньги перед боссом. Сколько смотрел полёты невесомости, или воздушные ямы в самолётах сам испытывал, кишки отлипают от живота, первые ощущения испуг и уж потом восторг.
what are mission specialists?
Impressive!  Go Team Branson.
Amazing ❤️
How soon will this go bankrupt? Yes kids in the future when housing, food , water are in short supply come spend , take a loan to pollute the upper atmosphere with rocket fuel. Its your dream come true.
i m gonna to ask my boss for a salary increase , i want to board on the next shuttle...enjoy guys
Approved.
Congratulations Virgin Galactic.
Ok, so next flight, how about we give them some simple tasks like brushing their teeth or drinking water so we can all laugh at how inept they are!! "Mission Specialists" are supposed to have a "Specialty" that involves more than doing back flips and high pitched laughing! LOL!!
Why???? What is the whole point of it.
Beautiful stuff, everything is possible.
Careful not to hit the firmament....
isn't that low earth orbit? Can we technically call it going to space???
amazing
1:41 nice flat horizon ;)
🙏🙏🙏
Funny how the Earth looks flat out the window. But every other shot show curvature 😂😂🤣🤣
His hands are shaking with excitement. A true human emotion...
They did not go into space.  All they managed to do was get to a high altitude--they never left the atmosphere.  The weightlessness is because the craft they were in started to descend giving those on board the illusion of weightlessness.  It's all smoke and mirrors--fish eye lenses on exterior cameras.
Those views alone. Yes, please!!!
Any higher and they'd probably be able to see Great A'Tuin. It's interesting how the windows they use make the world seem round.
Look c£€ts can fly
Serious missed opportunity to leave Richard Branson in Space
Hmmm... so they still did not develop warp speed ... See you in 50 years :D
Hands up who thought he was trying to open the window ✋
It's nice to see John  McAfee finally living out his dream
Ma non inquina??????
Earth 🌍....we love you “
Please make it creative commons so we can use it plz 💚🙏
Congratulations to everyone involved in the endeavor.
The earth is looking very brown nowadays.
Probably best not to show the Mark Sargent et al. flat earth crowd. Something tells me that might make their heads explode.
I hope my granddaughter will travel to the edge of space on my behalf - it's been my dream.
But there are people that keep saying the earth is flat
Everything is possible except RCB wins IPL
I was expecting to see a stewardess with a safety briefing and peanuts.
free enterprise!!!
I am here to check the comments about flat earth.
No wonder my internet price has gone up
"Unbelievable, this is too unbelievable. Awh!" I want to see that.
Military did this 60 years ago…don’t be so dramatic, people are suffering from a pandemic, billionaires wasting money to reach their stupid dream…
Fish eye lenses wtf. It's a glorified vomit comit. It's so stupid, the morons didn't go to space.
Flat earthers still digging the web to find something 100s of years ago 🤣🤣
He's doing things in a Virgin way
Wow
Why can't we focus on the earth's problems instead? What a total waste of resources.
tej and roman did it first
So I'm guessing the 1.2k dislikes come from all the flatearthers?!?
FLAT EARTH✌...your space is fake,but we love low orbit
Fake Zero G plane footage.  Thst woman with her mouth open makes me sick. WtF is wrong with her????
This is not space
What is the point of a parachute at that altitude without oxygen?
Make me the pilot🙀
Absolutely amazing! Richard Branson, first ever entrepreneur in space! (At least I think he is?)
Imagine being so disapointed losning the euro 2020 that you leave the planet.
How come a video of this magnitude and importance has had only 1 million views so far? What's wrong with humanity? Where is everybody who's got their brains into the future?
.. mising 10 kilometers... sorry, that was nice but isn't "space".
Our mother earth is so beautiful and we must keep it safe
Space Who?
I’m thinking they went to the moon and back. This is barely scraping the edge of earth’s atmosphere.
Была невесомость)! Я  сначала не верил... Молодец!!!
And the Billionaire Space Race begins. We are living in interesting times..
Roumors say ..she still has her mouth wide open ..
Warning for children. Don't try this at home
2:17 Thought he'd opened the window for a second!
Its not 85 km above earth !!! Its like 36 km maximum. I seen few videos taken from stratosferiic baloons and they look exactly the same.
Yay! Now humans can truly destroy Earth's ecosystem in a faster fashionable style.
how come so many air bubbles comming from the front at 56 seconds and more at 1 min 13 seconds infact everytime they show shots from outside therse air bubbles comming from the  craft
And he wanted the uk tax payer to foot the wage bill of his airline, yet he can spend his money on this.
“That’s for all the kids out there that dream the impossible, you can do it too, man. I believe in you”  Ring any bells?
I hope someday I would be able to buy a ticket and go even further!
Definitely the Earth is flat ( I’m crying 😂😂😂)
"I am tormented by an everlasting itch for things remote. I long to sail forbidden seas" - Herman Melville
Definitely the Earth is flat ( I’m crying 😂😂😂)
Still flat
in next 50-70 years humans will go to space or other planets for vacation this is amazing our future genrations will be proud of us!!!!!!
Wow nice flat horizon
Mr  patato amazing
They never hit space! Only upper earth atmosphere... ? What is all this fake hype for? Also, why don't they ever use flat lens on their cameras??? Purposefully hiding shapes?
Absolutely incredible. What an achievement!!!
Yea, the earth is still flat.
The flat earth looks quite curved.. hmm.
Don't get me wrong it's an amazing achievement, but 53 miles up technically isn't space...
Well done all involved. Fantastic feat of engineering and management to get to this stage so quickly. As other's have mentioned, it would be great to see the experience in the cabin after the drop, ignition, and the journey all the way up :)
You are making this possible! Wonderful!
Congratulations everyone 🎉🎉🚀🚀
I can watch this over and over. Richard really wasn’t ready to unbuckle ha ha. I can imagine Richard is excited to have another go 🚀
Truly amazing
These people are running away from gods punishment incoming
The earth looks warmer from up there guys do something to improve green footprint on this earth
see any ufos lol
FlatEarthers are taking their time dismissing this one aren't they lol.
This was nothing more than a publicity stunt. There have been several times they have done this flight so nothing special here. And face facts. This is just an uberrich white man satisfying his own need for glory. And it's false glory at that. He never went to space. It was basically a very expensive ride on the Vomit Comet. Al Shepard's suborbital flight reached 115 miles which is over double this flight.
This looks fake, everyone knows earth is flat.
it's like the rich kids playing in their piggybanks
pointless
Maybe you should consider spending all that money on trying to save our planet instead of trying to leave it
Needs a trolley service !
Nothing can exit the firmament.
Out of this World! 🤩 🙌
It's obviously a sub orbital but I'm just curious why it doesn't need a heat shield during re-entry?
So amazing! The world is a better place now ha ha
I wanted an interior shot of them when that rocket lit up 🚀
Doesnt look much like space but guess technically it is...
Welcome to the parabolic flight club👍
Meanwhile millions of ppl are starving.
People died so Branson could live his child hood dream. I hope he gave a moments thought to them when he was up there. Probably not.
Wow, and only 12 months ago virgin where begging the UK government for handouts over covid....... shame on Richard Branson, shame
If I had a billion bucks, sure anything is possible
Wishful thinking at the rate Mankind is going.
Congratulations; you've now accomplished something that hasn't been accomplished since 1959, when the X-15 did the same exact thing. Wahoo!
Their faces, looking down on earth… wonder, joy… endorphins galore!
aint a Virgin no mo'!
To everyone who got wipe out yesterday. Thanks VG for ruining the moment with stock dilution. Amazing achievement for Sir Richard Branson but please sir get a new management.
Is the earth flat or round then ?
Would be terrifying
The "fashionable insanity of the super rich " 😵 And what's worse ....they are actually praised and glorified for it ....😩
Did they meet Jesus there? I heard he " RISED TO HEAVEN "" 🤣🤣🤣   when will people stop believing in religious fairy tales?
Low earth orbit that's as far as we can go
Earth flat liesssd
These are the shots I have been waiting to see, Congraz Richard Branson and all at VG
Please crash!
I thought he was about to open the window 😂
Fake look bubble 🤣
so fake
You can clearly the the flat-earth
This thumbnail looks like a new Smash Mouth hit, but everyone is old and in space
Just here for the flat earther comments 🍿
10 years back ,when we heard about this project, never new that it is a possible one ..Thanks sir Richard Branson you made it possible, one day everyone can fly to space.
I’ve never seen an aircraft go in space that wasn’t a rocket taking off from the ground……what kinda aircraft is that thing?
Atleast half an hour or 30 Minutes is necessary in outer space is required. Imagine first time in Life some more minutes times is required.
Yea let’s not wear helmets or protective gear. Definitely real video lmao
why wont they show the passengers after the plane drop and during the rocketing up portion?
Smh
So glad I was able to see this🥰❤💖❤ വളരെ വളരെ സന്തോഷം🥰❤💖❤
"If you dream it, you can do it" -Walt Disney. CONGRATULATIONS VIRGIN GALACTIC!!!!

This Guy is a true inspiration for the youths. Happy to see indian flag I can see the happiness clearly in their face
Besos gonna up this and go for a space walk
LOL
I'm happy for him he has all that money to blow in five minutes and be so popular.,i can't even keep up with bills but i'm popular for being brokdown  on the road with my old truck,he will be my hero if sends me a couple of grands to fix my junky truck🙄🙄thank you.
Flight budget : Millions Microphone budget :
finally....space is getting attention.....
So the edge looked white??? Ice wall??
First thing i'd say up there- why is it so flat?
und jetzt ???  die ganze Kohle nur damit son seniler alter Typ in der Schwerelosikeit rumzappeln kann !!! das macht Sinn ... well done !!!
Some reason satelites dont orbit in the mesosphere I believe its because their mass and the distance is just too much and too close to  re-entry.  Thank you for your input! Correction, satelites cant orbit in the mesosphere because of atomic density of the mesosphere, and more than likely them being so close they're more prone to do a couple orbits and burn up from falling through the lower atmospheres.
Only billionaires man fucking wealth disparity.
It's my dream 🇲🇾
another billionaire in orbit.
The earth looks very flat. Just saying (I'm not a flat earther)
Virgin galactic should evolve into a class shuttle that can be used to study the mesospher. The mesospher is about 30-58 miles above the surface.
Impressionante! Uma experiência única, provavelmente isso deve mudar nossa perspectiva sobre o mundo.
Are the FLAT-EARTH Believers Back in their Hole ???😁
Ето вам Висине
flat earthers will say its fake.
Ruined it with Colbert.
Flat earthers be like
What do the flat earthers say?
Oh great! Disneyland rides for bored billionaires. Whoopdy F-ing Do.
Biggest waste of money ever. Entertainment purposes only.
Pretty amazing but they're not really orbiting at the same distance where the space station is .
Was Richard trying to open the window? 😳
Look Minute 1:12 horizontale horizon next view out ouf the ship u see the curve
aaah!  We're falling at the acceleration  of gravity!!
It's cheaper to fly to space than it is to buy a return ticket for a Virgin train from Manchester to London.  Branson is a parasite.
Next gen. Fuel for the dreamers of the world
THIS IS EPIC! HI ARIEL RIVADERO FROM 2050 :)
This is the beginning of whole new era in space exploration
"Let´s make space available for everyone"  Nice achievement but for 250K? I want to be in orbit, not stay floating for a few seconds :D
Flat earthers have been real quite since this happened
How come doesn't burn at reentry like the shuttle? That looks to me like a high altitude flight with a nice free fall creating the illusion of zero G
Lovely. A recreation of the x31 program. Reruns bore some of us.
Cool
Congratulations! I also have such dream.
I like what Richard bran said and I don’t even like the dude
Russia must be furious because no just nasa and spacex have won in innovation a space travel, also private companies have defeated them, puton putin 😀
This isn't inspiring.. Why would anyone wanna be Richard Branson. The man is disgusting.  If anything use this as a jump off point of not what to be..  Don't become rich by piggybacking off of other people's hard work while taking the glory..
The coolest thing….my Dad would be so amazed
I've lost any care what any Virgin/Richard Branson subsidiary accomplishes since suing the NHS, bad form has ruined any reputation they had with me.
Oh look the earth is flat…
this can be called "space surfing". congratulations! hope this spaceship can be improved to provide a bit longer space time for its passengers.
1:39 it's flat thanks for the  confirmation
I dream of Americans having free health care. Your rocket is cool though
Мечты случаются только у богатых!
"Space" flight
You can still be the first person to smoke weed in space as none of these people did it!
Why does the old man find it difficult to balance in zero gravity? A person can cope with such a task without any problems even with atrophied muscles, or an infant, and here the grandfather with great effort clings to everything that he grabs. In the last seconds, jet-powered plane removed from an old-fashioned 40s biplane? 😁😆😂
Blessed life👏💖
Branson looks like he's trying not to puke
Ahora astronautas divertidos Millonarios con juguetes
I'm here for the history and also to see Flatearthers crying.
Im scared of heights
At 2:18 Bronson tried to open the window.  At least to remove the windows gasket seal. :-)
Well done that man!
Technology makes the world a single global village.Through your victory humankind may   able to commute every planet in the universe. I think every human felt happy with your success on this globe.conquer the universe.
We’re all included in this footage 😌
Fake news, 🌎 is flat
EARTH IS FLAT
Think something is "fishy",  at the altitude they were at and no suit??
Thats space to me. Congratulations 👏👏👏👏
So... Are those bubbleson the outside of craft that are rising to the?surface of the pool????
Just as I thought, "only so far until they hit fernament. Dead end
I just had a really sad thought. If only Stephen Hawking had lived a few more years, he could have done this, no problem :/
It's cool and all, but that ain't space
a lot of Russian investors are waiting and wondering when the next flight is planned?
If I can't experience it i dont give two hoots about it.
Spaceflight inside the atmosphere ? pathetic. You should have told those paying clowns that they  feels antigravity just because they are falling
Why does the normal astronaut require the huge suits and helmet when going to space if these guys were going up there with just a flight suit?
I KNEW EARTH WAS FLAT!
Nul, un quasi non évènement. Une horreur de bouillasse de marketing !
Real happiness
They need to have lotteries. A dollar lottery ticket might win you a $250,000 seat to space. That would allow the average Joe/Jane to have a chance to go at least until the price comes down more. And it would fund the millions on maintenance on the spaceships.
Narrative of Self is the result of a feedback loop between “Separate Self” & Cosmos🎈
there was lot of space for a cat in there
soon flat earthers will run out of excuses ^^
Just brilliant. All that's needed now is a hotel in orbit for this thing to dock to. Hint hint Richard Branson 👍😁
SLIMTHAREALEST
epic!
this man is absolutely mad
I can only say,🤮 O sorry,i don´t fast enough...
youre still beneath the Karman Line............ not really space but the point where space and the atmosphere meet
Space is only darkness, I'm not see the stars
2:15 for a second there I thought he was gonna open the window for some fresh air
BRANSON DOES IT AGAIN!!! FKNG INCREDIBLE
Dont you worry sir...your wifi connection is still poor down on the earth.
Thank goodness they used fisheye lenses or we wouldn't be able to see the curvature of the earth.
Never thought I would get to see this in my lifetime.... thank you for making it possible
Why are people excited to see some insanely rich d-bag further enjoy something they never will? Call it jealousy I don't care. It's like incessant sports fans for people that will never know or care about you. Especially nowadays...
Amazing Richard 👍
I cried watching this looking at him. He’s in bliss. Never stop dreaming folks.give love and be humble.
and you wonder why the west is on fire with temps over 100 degrees, where is John Kerry when you need him, Climate Change!
we're already in space though; the entire earth is in space
Amazing to see Spaceship 2 achieve it's ultimate goal. With the troubles Spaceship 1 faced I was woried it'd be abandoned, but you persevered. Truly inspirational and a lovely speech.
Had to be 22 ;)
Virgin Galactic can't stand up to Chad Elon
🥰🥰🥰🥰
I co ziemia jest płaska czy nie?
All that & no one joined the 62 mile high club?🙈
Man it felt like a piece of cake! How they made it so smooth?
Congrats what about achievement don’t let anyone tell what is not possible.
That was fast . How long did they stay up in space ??? And how much did that cost them???
How much a ticket cost ?
can we all agree on this beeing just a very high parabolic flight and def. not worth money and risk? lets just wait for the real man in this game: papa elon.
so this 80years old grandpa spent 20million to the space experience⊙▽⊙we have hope to work harding
So, the mega rich are going to spend 10s of thousands of dollars to experience being in a very fast elevator for a few minutes?
The torpid geology pharmacokinetically gaze because octopus exceptionally prevent next a encouraging frown. pointless,  far-flung objective
Santhosh George Kulangara going to be the first Indian space tourist ❤️....
All that time and money used to develop this, and you can't even best Alan Shepard's first space flight? This is what over 50 years of maned space flight gets us? Worthless!
It’s kind of jogging my memories of the Interstellar movie. Truly amazing
As always, in the first seconds, the plane from below filmed Superman flying by! 😁 It is not clear why the nozzles are smoked in clean "space" conditions, as if a solar oil burns in turbines from combustion in a space vacuum😆 What the hell is flying off the plane after the extinguished turbines? Are they already at 50 km height - weightlessness? Then it is clear how the Sun and the Moon fly over the flat plane of the Earth, how airships flew until the last disaster. But people, as always, are deceived and filmed cartoons about the Earth Ball😂
Its fun to watch an obscenely rich dude get blasted into space.
Obviously fake
Lol, skirting the edge of space and calling it a spaceflight is like boogie boarding for 10 minutes and calling it an oceanic voyage. Yes, you touched the ocean and traveled a bit, big whoop, not a voyage.
Cadê os terraplanistas? Cadê a aboboda? Kkkkk
Ну что, круглая?
This shows you how small are the things that you stress about in life  and you can just gaze upon  them one day from space and just be glad that you were born on a world that glows in the darkness in the darkness of space.💫
We are truly in a new era of Human Spaceflight
indian girl in space
F's in chat to flat earthers
it doesn't look very special !!!!
Richard excited to look out the window in search of potential security software customers...
Congratulations.
New toy for the dissociated and rich people. It is a pleasure to look a such a generous and empathetic people using energy whithout creating pollution for the shake of their own distraction.  Thanks very much, you are an example for the new humans to be born
Fair play Richard, you did it!! Looks fun, how much for a ride?!
Annnnd, the Earth is round.
I wish you didn't feel the need to go into space to understand that the world is one and the same, that everyone lives under the same sky. There are people who already have this common sense and have not seen the earth from space. And if you cared about the planet as you say, you wouldn't also be spending millions of dollars on a tourist trip and contributing to the climate crisis with those rockets emitting unnecessary carbon. In my opinion, touristic trips to space should be illegal, they should only be done for scientific purposes.
I wonder what Flat earthers will say when they catch a flight of the earth on the 10years and see a blue globe
How much time they spent in space?
I wonder what flat earthers are thinking 😆
Half hop.
This is a classic case of someone who has more money than sense Millions are dying around the world and millions more are living in poverty  Whilst this wreck less billionaire wastes millions of dollars on his childhood dream Pathetic
Amazing!
Looks like you have a handle on momentary space entry and exit.  Very nice.
1:25 Branson is definitely starting to feel sick.
Love the rocket sound fx in space where there is no atmosphere to carry the sound
Fantástico a experiencia posso imaginar vendo este vídeo.
Why Jeffe didn’t go?
Unless you are wealthy, Space tourism is a big waste. Planet Earth already has so much diversity, there's so much to see and experience which is enough for a lifetime. Maybe going to Mars or any other planet to live for a short time is worth it for many but just this space tourism is wasting of resources down the drain. Hope this 1st step really blossoms and the technology matures and advances to experience something worthy to try in the future.
Looks like being Queen Amidala's starship, very fine. Incidentally, I made Branson popular too, chose him. He's in my timetable too. He would do everything to extract space knowledge and technologies from me because I contained the Tamayos' knowledge and techs. We were the space station designers and builders. We were Starfleet, Star Wars and Star Trek.
fake
Where is Jeff?
A toy for the top 1% 😐
That’s the problem for people who have to much money, it’s like a children’s playing garden !!
This is real business. Not those so called Mars immigration project using the decades old NASA tech to impress the stock market. So fake
Phase 2 - Fit some handles to hold on to.
We need Eddie Bravo to get on board
I can't wait for the flat earthers to say that this is fake and it was filmed in Hollywood...hahahahahahahaha!
Let's not forget this is the man that threatened to lay off his staff if he couldn't furlough them, but he can afford to waste millions going into space for 10 minutes.
I want to see interior shots during rocket burn and re-entry. Why were those not included?
So many water bubbles. They don't even try to hide the trick anymore.
Its not a space flight space starts at 100 km up of ground he only went to 87 km so its not a space flight just high altitude flight simple Fact
That speech he gave was total cringe.
Respectfully, Mr. Branson, I find this whole exercise offensive. You have accomplished nothing that has not already been done. Despite what you claim your space plane, pound for pound, dumps a huge a.ount of hydrocarbons. This so-called space venture of yours does nothing for or ever will for the common man. The two words that keep coming to mind are "morally offensive".
Вот мы и дожили до таких моментов. Жаль не у всех столько денег, чтобы увидеть "Космос" раз в этой жизни!
Fake garbage.
This is why our atmosphere is fucked and all this global warming because of these bozos with money busting it wide open
Nice one Richard!
Jeff who???????
The first starship.
They just made a free fall
He forgot to mention  “ 4 extremely rich adults in space” lol
what a nonsense. first they have not been in space, it is not a spacecraft. it is not a contribution to space travel. look at Elon, who builds real spacecraft🙂
Why fish eye lens for a camera?
What a pointless waste of money. Another way for the ultra-rich to conspicuously consume the obscene wealth they've accumulated. But props to the engineers who actually made it work (albeit after killing one test pilot)
Wait...The earth seems round...
In my lifetime, I would like to visit mars for 6 months-2 years!
X15 did this in the 50s. SpaceX taking people to the space station and launching commercial payloads weekly. Virgin = yawn. Just more tourism for the mega rich.
There is me, trying to eat less Palm Oil
wow this is very nice.
And then you see a star destroyer getting out of hyperspace...
2:33 - 2:36. Lower left. How is that flying debris curving in space?
i wish i could go there
I just want to ask how do u feel seeing the other side ,the darkness?
Pay tax instead of this unbelievable nonsense.
No interstellar theme?
I wonder how they kept the hull cool on reentry
Congratulations on a successful flight. I hope I can someday afford it. It would be nice to upgrade the cameras. 4K action cameras are only $60. Even I can afford that. But sorry, that’s not supportive.
KSP vibes
epic!!!!
i rode that ride in disneyland.
A truly inspirational man, godspeed sir
Human Beings are incredible
❤️ Incredible 😎
Beautiful, so beautiful
Neato!
Congrats on an amazing achievement, glad you beat "Jeff who" to space
The sour steel incidentally x-ray because baseball sequently measure amongst a political way. meaty, laughable newsprint
1:15 This is exciting 😃 Lucky ones
Money can buy happiness
Am I the only one who was looking forward to watching their reentry?
Is it only me who is not able to understand why this is a big deal. A 4-minute view at EDGE of the space and an apparent zero gravity simulated by free fall and not by escaping it.
This is the first step to more commercial space flight for the masses. It's expensive yes, for now, but over time will get cheaper and more accessible. I look forward to the time of my flight in the future.
That pilots a legend. He needs to hand fly the thing 80000 m up and down    Counting the 45k feet plane.
Congrats y'all!
What does all the flat-earthers think of this
Did the space craft have a heat shield?
The last time I saw a mouth like that white girl's "it had a hook in it"
I wish the video had a better editor. And longer clips. Such an amazing feat and few shots only is what they come out with.
Hope they took a lot of pictures for the Flatearthers. 😂
what is really terrific about this is is that a billionaire has spent a vast amount of money doing something that really only benefits him and a few others but none of the other 7.6+ billion people on earth, but sure, if that's how you want to spend your money!
Please let Sam Chui go next :)
We are already as far out in space as we are ever going to get.
Is it only me or someone also feels the same! I don't feel to go to tue space, I feel to go down in the ocean and High on mountains more.
Did they technically reach to zero gravity? if 86 km's is zero gravity then why ISS is free falling at 400 km's ? can someone help me with this question?
I also have desire to see 🚀🌌
Branson, Gates and Musk could educate and feed the World's children and STILL be 99.9% richer than anyone..  Musk is pushing the boundaries of the human race and the "business" of Space travel, and Gates is one of the most generous and philanthropic people on the planet.  Sending people to "Space" (or close enough) for a 10 minute "Joy ride"...   All while hiding massive profits in offshore tax havens..  Yeah.. lets not forget this "joyride" has already cost one human life..  Its all fun and games until it all goes VERY VERY wrong..
Waste of billions of pounds / dollars , when the planet needs fresh water and fires need putting out . Invent an affordable 5k family electric vehicle maybe ? While poverty and homelessness needs addressing , millionaires and rich play on space ships going no where except up and down. On a lighter note ... At least save one seat for head flat earther and prove the roundness of the globe they’re on , sadly even then they will say they have been tricked and it’s all an elaborate hoax via drugs , 3d screens and fair ground ride physics 🤣 , suppose it gives the brainwashed religious someone to laugh at 🥳
Ah, to have billions of dollars and do senseless things.
I'm offering tickets (£200) for a space walk that rivals Virgin Galactic. Meet in my back garden by the trampoline!
Il est content, il a fait son tour de manège.
Richard Branson really is a pompous nob
Calling people that purchased trip to space astronauts is ridiculus... big props to the pilot tho that thing is HARD to touchdown with
why isnt this #1 on trending
Sky is not the limit
Now can we take a few of the Flat Earther idiots up there to show them once and for all the earth is Round!!
WOW, I wish I could do this sometime.
I wonder how did he not cry😭😭
now i'm sure that porn movies in space will happen soon!
Les autres s'amusent comme des enfants à l'intérieur pendant que lui  contemple dehors ! 😅
I imagine being a parent of a deadly ill or starving child with no money to cure him/her watching this 70yo teenager spending his (?) money like this. And other people say "you inspire us Richard to dream big" - this is so immature. People watch this and celebrate progress but there will never be progress for us if children are dying of diceases or hunger just because of the lack of money. Progress means prosperity for all, not the dreamcometrue moment for 1 person. Future is our children. Brenson is already the past.
This is awesome. Have a great day everyone reading this. Love from Purple
Ramaneti ba acolo .
Looks like a computer animation  , is it real?
am I the only one that noticed how dried up and dead our planet looks?
Unless you have the rioters and looters like we have in kwazulu natal
is it necessary to make a race out of everything.
No duty free…….count me out.
It's so, flat.
I dont see the $250k value for a ticket
Just wow
The simple division reilly hope because dinner lately clip times a immense scorpio. cuddly, hypnotic card
They thought of everything.   Except for handles by the windows.
Congrats to the Virgin Galactic's team!
Waste of fuel. Save it for exploration. Not for a 3 minute between space and earths  atmosphere trip. Smh
That's pretty spectacular! Imagine feeling no falling but your facing the Earth? I remember sky diving.... But this is something else!
Why did we not see the re-entry segment of the recording? Also how come NASA space shuttles and capsules require huge amounts of heat shielding on the undersides for the intense temps and burn up risks on re-entering the atmosphere?🤔 Or have i been watching too much movies 🤣
What a lucky man...
This is absolutely incredible
Ah space :)
why don't you have 360 degree cameras? why don't you have 3D cameras? why don't you have 360 degree 3D cameras? why don't you have more cameras?
Congrats amazing, but weightlessness lasted only for 2 mins and 30 seconds.
How happy are they great job
Glad they returned home safely. This is huge
Just a matter of time before some band or artist buys all the seats so they can be first to do a music video in space….
Water skiing = scuba diving? I don't think so. Isn't this kind of the same little mind game? Let's just call it HMS Ultrasonic Moneyburner.
like being at the fun fair, a long wait, expensive ticket, over b4 you know it,
Fisheye lens! Lol the Earth is FLAT!
Fake!
I wish the head of the flat earthers movement could go to end that nonsense
This is for all the people who's says space is fake and earth is still flat. 😆😆
I can't believe this... You inspired us 🔥
How high did they go?
2:15 for a second there, i thought he was about to open the window for some fresh air
It will take until 2025 , for spce to be cash positive !!!!! And that is even if they if they get through all the red tape dealing with the government, because the government owns space airspace
Should add handles to hold onto so he’s not pulling at the material around the windows.
Awsome achievement 👏👏 Well done to Sir Branson and his team
Better than STAR WARS, The Force is with YOU
WASN'T FULLY CREWED !!!!!!! 2 seats still remained vacant !!!!!!!
If something goes wrong those parachutes are wearing you for protection.
Yep, Earth is a ball,..........
Most expensive theme park ride
Yes, in 30 years there will be Palmdale International Spaceport outside LA, and folks will be riding much larger commercial Virgin rocket shuttles up to destination space station resorts in orbit!
OK! how many people thought he was trying to open the window in space 😂😜
Well you don’t have to worry about going pee in space on that trip..you are there long enough to take one. LOL
Congrats👍
Honestly I’d be more interested in going up at night at and looking away from earth
THE EARTH IS NOT FLAT??? OMG
Bravo mais des poignées au fenêtre serais pus pratique pour regardera dehors
wonder why they dont need suits or helmet? Even spacex need...
The oceans on fire, three different places and the richest people are flying away and you idolize them? 🤮
Woooow!!!  Watch carefully from 2:29 to 2:37 , some strange light is turning right,  into the sun .😮😮😮😮
Ur in studio lol stage 20
So basically we have skyplanes ( flies in air and space or simply in sky.) Congratulations team Virgin Galactic.
A beautiful moment but also another societal fracture; this is truly the playground of the rich.
A high altitude plane that goes nowhere, does nothing.
Cannot ‘afford’ to pay his workers (furlough) but can afford to go to space, the sheer audacity of the rich....
Well done - you lucky people!
Bezos jumped out his seat screaming who does this guy think he is? I’m about to open an Amazon center on Mars. No testing. Just use the same people we use as crash test dummies. I’ll show him.
Wait...the Earth isn’t flat?  Lol 😂  Great work Mr. Branson!
look safer to me than.....
Jeez that cgi is terrible, looks like something China would put out, should have at least taken some wrinkles out of his face and got rid of the air bubbles from the under water tank pmsl
Space??? If you don't need a heatshield to reentry, it's not space for me.
Petition to not let richard brenson re-enter earth
Looks like they flew to the edge of space for a short time before gliding back in.
I want to do my part but I want to go to space I have a way for you to launch that m*********** high enough and fast enough without a toe plane maybe we can work something out
That’s awesome
So, how much will it cost for 2 minutes of weightlessness? 🤦
Hello flat earthers lol
Now we just need to develop some kind of propulsion system that isn't so polluting.....
And the next day SPCE stock dropped like a rock and is still going down. I will never understand the stock market.
Its amazing
Where are those flat earthers now? 🤣😂🤣😂
A great day Richard...... thanks to Burt Rutan of course. I've  been waiting for this a long time. Well done from Rome👍🇬🇧
Adult kids with too much money.
Next, the moon. JK...near earth orbit is as far as man has ever gone.
get a grip people....this is ground breaking like a moped.....in other words its not.
Does Virgin Atlantic serve drinks and peanuts during the short flight? And where are the flight attendants?
Where are the stars 👁
It’s a small step for mankind but one giant leap for a personal ego.
You can feel how much it means to him
Amazing…whatever you do, don’t puke!
Are these guys even astronauts.
Va tutto bene....basta che poi questi non ci predichino l'ecosostinibilita'
amazing!!
😂🤣😂
Is lex Luthor going to be okay ?...On the next episode of space race billionaires
My hero!
Richard Proved Age is Just a Number😍
Mmmm with his billions he could've given housing to all the homeless in America, and still be a billionaire
Amazing well done Sir Richard
Wake me up when Branson gets to orbit. Musk is building a Mars colonization craft and these guys are still stuck at the Alan Shepherd stage.
Please donate me a seat.......Love from India
The  cost  of  this  was  how much ?
fake. Earth is flat.
Perhaps a pivotal moment in the history of space exploration! Removing the reigns from the hands of big, bulky, time consuming, governmental agencies and unleashing the ingenuity of private entrepreneurship is long over due.
He should work on miniaturizing people next, imagine what fun we could have then?
The man responsible for installing grab handles just lost his job.
Interstellar vibes
Now, Pray return to the waking sands.
Only in America is this considered space. Internationally they're not in space.
Did you see any UFO 🛸👽??
I thought Richard Branson had no money.  he was asking for money from the British government to help his airline  even though he keeps his money off shore 🤔
Brought to you by fossile fuels.
they were so disoriented they look like rabbits in headlights
How they re-enter atmosphere? It is not clear in the video. Usually when space shuttles re enter earth intense heat 🔥 is produced due to friction and the shuttle becomes like a fire ball for some time. How the virgin Galactic manages this part. Any one who knows about this please clarify me. When returning it is just a glider with no fuel ⛽ inside. But how they manages the re entry friction point.
Put Musk, Gates, and Bezos on a one way ticket into space.
Imagine if you were lost in space and had no way of getting back. It's gonna be a sucky way to die.
I wouldn't call this little "hop" a space flight!    It's more a Virgin Air commercial.    😎
The gratitude Richard Branson showed and to think of others by saying “you can do it “ Brilliant
We did this like 50 years ago, let's go to mars already
I don't think I've ever watched an event and crossed my fingers so much for someone I'm unlikely to ever meet and who has no clue I exist. So happy for all involved. What a great achievement and experience.
Атракцион для тех, кому некуда девать деньги. Практической пользы нет.
You barely got in and only lasted a few minutes. 😂
I can’t wait until I can afford to do this.
They don’t want us to drive our cars but we can do this?
50 miles up is considered space,lol,Only 238,850 more miles to get to the moon!smh
Leaving a comment here as a timestamp !
I thought this was some random 1990s Music Video lol
So you went on a high speed plane ride…
Id be too scared to do that lol...
history has been made. kudos.
മലയാളീസ് ഇല്ലേ, നമ്മുടെ SGK യും ഇത് പോലെ പോവും😍
The earth isn’t flat? Who knew? 😅
Isn't the rubber around the window responsible for not letting air escape from inside of the ship? Why is Richard clinging to it like that, isn't it dangerous?
Mass effect series in real life awesome 👍
This looks fake
How fast it feels like 😊
I was here
Cngrats, VG and Sr Rchard Bransn! Y deserve ths!
The boiling half-sister potentially smell because dorothy genotypically face lest a certain interest. chief, oceanic harmony
i can watch gravity movie rather paying loads of dollars for few minutes amusement  soryyy....
Do you know what’s funny. Hardly anyone knew this was happening
Where were the flight attendants with the drink cart??  Anyway,   nice job Virgin G, you are truly pioneers, and I'm super excited to see what comes next.
Let me get this straight... In 1969 we landed on the friggin moon, and in 2021 we've escaped earth's gravity for 30 seconds. And I'm supposed to be excited? Objectively speaking, doesn't that seem a bit strange to anyone?
"nobody fart"
dommage qu'on envoie pas c'est imbécile con comme la lune dans le soleil sa nous ferais des vacances
Just like nasa, your earth images are computer generated. It's funny how no news for 30 years from this company then suddenly the same plane works.
Wow Curvature of the Earth! It is Round!
An expensive vanity project by a narcissist. Stupidity in the time of climate crisis.
Billions of pounds going towards this when his poor Virgin staff were being dismissed and not getting paid during the pandemic. Money well spent Richard!
u the best man... congrats.. 👏👏👏👏
He is a down to Earth guy have y'all even been invited to Virgin Mobile party host by him yeah gotta be vip
2:18 "Now let's go outside and enjoy the spaceweather guys!"
Historias de millonarios en Instagram:
Yay let's pollute even more so  the rich can play with thier toys instead of helping the poor.
flat earthers watching 👁️👄👁️
Ah ça pour poluer, chez les milliardaires, il y a du monde..
Those flat earther group must be refusing to believe this
I dont buy it
Meaning of statement - " I need some space " soon gonna change !!
Imagine lecturing the world about an imaginary climate crisis AND offering spaceflights to amuse the elites of this world at the same time...
I just love it,  i don't know way  but just loved it..🤞🏻
Wow, looks fun.
Do you think strapping flat earthers in there would be worth it or not?
Wake up Stupid People, They are NOT in space, Just high altitude. And Earth is NOT a spinning water Ball, Look at the "Concave" @1:47 Fake BS from a "Globalist" pushing Lies !
Fabulous. Just amaxing. It would be great to add the speed and high on the plane as seen live.
No video of the re-entry from space? Hmmmm... Must have never happened.
so Sir Richard niw has his own Zero g plane! It's weird that  THE DOD DEFINES SPACE AT A DIFFERENT ALTITUDE TO THE NAVY AND THE AIRFORCE!  IS IT NOT!?
Getting paid for piloting a rocket plane to space,,ahhh free trip to space + lots of dollars
Bades live stream ever
New FLEX for us to watch
it would be funny if this little rocket plane overshot and just break away from orbit and the whole crew just stranded in there as it begin its journey to wonder space
Congratulations 🎉 I’m happy for them 🙏🏻
A legacy this kind achievements is what makes you immortal.
Branson went to space: if we can do this, imagine what you can do?  Me:
No images of the interior when engine thrust, typical lying virgin, and you didnt reach space, its 100 kilometres distance
For those that _SHUDDER_ at the price for flying on this vehicle:  Remember that in the early days of Aviation in the 20th century, flying long distance was _VERY EXPENSIVE._  Flying a Zeppelin airship across the Atlantic Ocean from Europe to America cost something in the range of $3,000 USD, which in the 1930s was *A SH*TLOAD OF MONEY.*    Flying into space will never be _"dirt cheap,"_ but in the coming decades it will become more affordable.  Just like Aviation did.
That would be Absolutely insane!!!!
But he didn't go into space
Fantastic, well done Virgin 👍🏽
Чуть не сломали изнутри.
2:48 Alien Alert
I got that high in college once.
Wow ! So glad everything was a success.
Im going to space, that’s my goal, I let you guys know in 20-30 years if I succeeded or not.
Its nice that millionaires will be able to go into space but not so nice for the 98% of the population that will be dead in 60 years from global warming.  This is just a case of boys who could afford toys.  Why not just build your own nuclear bombs?  Same affect lol
Lol that’s so dangerous.  Definitely worth it though
Thumbs up Richard and company.  Let’s make the future happen!
Don’t open the windows Richard
Oh, look at that. It’s round and not flat.
Pathetic!  Its a case of two billionaires racing into space for their egos.  Imagine if he and musk spent the same amount of time, energy and resources to end the reliance on fossil fuel.  Instead they are  just adding to the problem.
They did not achieve total weightlessness. Near outer space experience. Still in the earth’s atmosphere.
Like start trek movies
mad
Just dropping a comment incase I accomplish mine
You can see bubbles while they film in swimming pool! LOL
The stars disapeared! LOL
Can you here me know?
Fake bs
There is still sheeple that beLIEve this BS!
Is Richard trying to open the window?! Don't do that!
Awesome..
2:34 ufo u see it ?
Show for feaks! Hahaha
Look,earth is not flat guys.👏👏👏
You know there's space station up there. Manned by actual people.
CGI BULLSHT! AHAHAH
São Homens Empreendedor como esse que escrevem o futuro, parabéns !!! A Virgin Galátic precisa conhecer o Grafeno, o nióbio brasileiro os materias do futuro !!! Parabéns 🎉🎉👏👏👏
Congrats Virgin Galactic.
Just leaving a comment here... So when i travel to space in 20 or 40 years in the future, i can come back to this and smile that this moment right here... Is what made it all possible... 🙏❤️
They kind of look stupid - it seems more like they are free falling then being in space.
So earth is not flat? Right?
I'm not sure 'fire fire' should remain on the call out.
Awesome
Eat the Rich
Please took some flatearth society's mad people there to show the flat earth from outer space.
I always thought you had to have some sort of protection on windows/visors when it comes to viewing the sun in space, due to no filtering from atmosphere... Cosmic radiation, UVA/B/C and all the rest...
Finally... proof that the earth is flat!
Pardon me for not being awestruck by the achievement of launching a billionaire into orbit.  They all but own everything else, so they might as well get to play in orbit and look down on us serfs, struggling below with a global pandemic.
Are they really in space??????
Funny that There’s no curvature with the non-wide angle cameras😉
please make the ship bigger so can float much further without bumping to each other
Awesome! Congrats to the whole team! PS. What is she doing with that pump at 2:01?
The flat earthers and moon landing deniers must be pissed lol
Pilots wearing altitude masks and equipment but the crew isn't.  People who believe this stuff are a special kinda stupid.
Inspiring
haha....Admit it, the earth is flat.... you see in the video, they saw it in truth themselves. You can CLEARLY see when they shift from regular lens to a fisheye lens.
Deception & Fraud = richard bransons legacy
So flat earthers can now finally go into space. 😂
Fake
It's impossible for billionaires and /or rich people to help find a cure for cancer or the millions of poor people around the world.
You too can exploit your workers by not sharing any of the wealth they created.. and maybe one day you'll be the biggest tool desperately clinging to youth in space!  Forget about spending money on solving actual problems!!!
This has to be in a studio. The earth is flat!
Дядя, тебя обманули. Космический полет это когда облетаешь Землю хотя бы 1 раз. Остальное это онанизм.
Dont ever comeback branson
Please leave him there …😂
All that money just for 2 minutes on the edge of earth's atmosphere 🤷‍♂️
What a toy ,wow.
High altitude, not space. You can't go further than they did
Space starts at 100km
Why fish eye lenses give the earth an unnatural curve?
My dream❤❤❤💓💓
Almost like those flights on Jeffrey's  lolita express right Richard ?
This weightlessness is illusory. The speed of the ship's removal from the earth and the 9.8 m/s acceleration of free fall became equal - that's why the illusion of weightlessness arises, but at an altitude only after 400,000 km, the earth's attraction is almost zero. And this apparent weightlessness is artificial, like people in a falling plane.
What most people don't understand sadly, is this is a sign of the growing inequality in our world. That private entities/individuals are able to afford through hoarding of wealth to finance what only nations could afford. This shows that we have failed, while an old white man goes to space, but a black child somewhere in Africa cannot even affoard to leave his village.
Great speach there Mr. Branson, lets hope other dreamers will put more effort in achieving many great things
You burn a lot of oxygen by flying rockets.
"If we can do this, just imagine what you can do!"  Man I was born in a third world country, do you seriously expect me to achieve anything?
Imagine having enough money to end world hunger, and being like, "Nah, I'm gonna use this to go to space with some homies"
Oh let me guess, that was just CGI too flat earthters???
I'm so glad you was able to avoid paying all that tax so you could go to space for a few minutes whilst homelessness is rife at your own back door. 💫✨💗
If it makes us unwashed masses feel any better, that experience is definitely not worth 250,000z
Yawn
do something useful for humanity. this does nothing.
This is fake right?
Happiest man achieving his childhood dream!
I feel the silence of space for a moment...
Clearly, they were not prepared as they didn't know what to say. But there was so much to say... And they failed to make it interesting...
Truman show
Nn ve crede più nessuno
Basta cazzate ... possiamo andare su Marte e luna ma nn possiamo andare in Antartide .... sulpicius gallus m
What are the environmental costs of this?  Why do we need to send up "tourists" to space. These questions need to be asked.  There are horrific environemntal consequences.
*Just like fast 9.*
The Flat Earthers are going to say that this video is fake or and the Earth is round just because of the camera lens. Something like that.
True alpha
People with large egos should be automatically booked for flights.
Congratulations Richard on achieving your Dream and making it possible for us to share with you.  Greetings from South African Boer.
17 years after its "Galactic" founding and the result is just suborbital...
Maybe Richard could have invested that money in a cure for cancer instead of his big ego.
Still missing the pictures, videos etc from the globe spinning around.  Why we never have a nice view from the front of the spaceship? Or an open angle  video from outside the spaceship flying around the earth?
the earth is flat and trump won the election
Meh, whatever
Congratulations Mr Branson
Quite amazing but down the road We'r going to be laughing at those early vids of buncha people dressed like Star Treck floating in a tube for a few minutes,
Congratulations Sir Richard Branson, Virgin Galactic and the whole space team!!! Thanks for inspiring dreamers!!!!$😎🎉🚀❤🌠🍾✌🏽
Next time, go to real space
That cabin needs a redesign, quick fold away chairs & hand rails.
I can Imagine all the Flat Earthers having brain explosions right now. Shame it costs so much.
what a joke. gee i got a few billion to toy with. heck with feeding the homeless or gettin someone outta debt. i'm going to build me a space toy.
Now that is amazing
Hope humans take  cognizance of fact they have hampered our planet earth with their greedy activities And works together to replenish what we have lost with same enthusiasm
Trully Amazing... I could sense the thrill and joy on everyone faces! what a present gift Richard!!! :)
Why not landing to the moon?
For this you used money??
This is unbelievable... This is too unbelievable... That little epithet there.... Sums it all up... For those of us that know what time it is....
They want 28 millions dollars for that ride
Dreams really do come true
Keep on dreaming Richard. Great to see this!!
Lol at 1.42  no curvature of the earth.
Flat Earth debunked
Flat earthers must hate this footage 🤦‍♂️
Congratulations Mr Branson but if nothings impossible any chance of sorting my broadband out its lagging alot 🤣 p.s when is the next flight ✈️ very very impressive well done everyone 👏
So ridiculous !
Keren pak Richard 🙏🏻
First flight of the "Fantastic Four"
not even close to low earth orbit. Its only space by definition. Your not truly in space until you have left the influence of gravity which no human has done yet because even the moon is too close. They where not floating by just falling like how it works on the international space station. You can get the same experience on the comet comet.
Building a spaceship and going to space yourself. Smart move. Pulling on a window seals while in space. Not so much.
It is fake video, the earth is flat ! :-D
Awesome🤩
Am I the only one who thinks this is actually pretty dumb?
Do something for humanity Branson. Only the mega wealthy will get to go to space. Next time, don’t come back.
Wow amazing
but it didn't go into space
Hi flat earthers...
So a high altitude vomit comet? Was it REALLY space or just a giant parabola?
If we could just have seen those images live... Not professional at lla, Virgin team! And your giant logo, please!
So cool to see this beeing possible. Well 99.99% of us watching this will never have a chance anyway. I envy the future.
2:16 For a moment I thought Richard was gonna let in some fresh air
Flat earthers need a ride
Not all that flat, IS IT?
Your on your way to hell man, congrats.
Clay Morrow is going places
wow...That speech was very bland
Pls make at least 1000 of these planes now and go commercial.
And now the meek will begin to inherit the Earth, while the wealthy travel Space.
they need a bigger plane for 4 people 😂
What a crock of bolocks
...looks flat to me
Four specialist in what, being rich and saying "Weeee" & "Hahaha"?
The Cockpit seems exposed, what if someone tried to take over the aircraft???
Imagine seeing the Earth in your eyes  that would probably be the best sight in your entire life.
Awesome!!! 🎉  I would have loved to see an inside shot when "release release release" to see how they felt that acceleration!! :D
The plane never got to space..it started dropping back to earth and they called it zero g…not true space flight..only 58 miles up..
Forgive me for being stupid but why are the pilots required to wear oxygen masks and not the passengers?
Shirisha having indian tricolour on her arm🇮🇳
Lovely ... looking forward to all of us getting a chance to go to space
Why does Dicky keep doing those expressions with the lips,  the woman did it to
technically they were not in space they should have travelled an extra 200 miles up for ti to be classed as space
Its fake. Thats not even branson , its copy. And all cgi haha
sucks to be flat earthers right now
patterns are all around us Paths are there to discover everything is possible
THEY DID NOT GO TO SPACE, ONLY TO THE OUTER ATMOSPHERE. RUSSIA DID THAT IN 1958
Congratulations to the team from all at Airspeeder
Are there risks of exposure to Sun's radiation during those 2-3 mins in space? Their suits don't look all round protective like the ones worn by SpaceX/Shuttle astronauts.
BTW,  where's some internal video's of them when that rocket ignites...  I wanna see their faces.
Virgin！you should use music named Tubular Bell  as your BGM
I can’t believe guy fury went to Space
This is fake the earth is flat
Awesome!!! Another great step for humanity.
Must be nice to be rich...
But yhe flight was under the 100km líne... so its not space yet...
When I flew on a Virgin Airlines flight as a passenger to London I didn't realise I was part of the crew.
lOoK tHE eArTh Is FLATTTTTT
A tasteless billionaires vanity project as dumb as those who find this exercise interesting.
Just for 90 miles from Earth, you guys are charging 2 lakh dollars?.. I. E approx  14 crore rupees approx. That's too much
No mention of Burt Rutan during any of the streams? I assume Virgin bought the intellectual rights?
Space*
Looks cool. But knowing how many people have died today from not having what to eat,I can’t help but question is this what we really need?
Engineers and Scientists are the gods of our world.
Wow 2021 it took that long to send an airplane to the edge of space....Only Virgin Galactic could do that.. Please if it was real the moon would be nothing but a truck stop..people have been dying to get off this planet.. This video could be used as more proof about earth being an in closed system.
Looks like the fisheye lens malfunctioned
Amazing! Can't wait to see more such videos of rich folks feeling weightlessness!
Branson makes my flesh creep.
Крутой дядька!
First we got are Brexit done. Now we got this done. There is no end to England's potential. The wirld need's us.
I've never seen a virgin accomplish so much since I got out of bed this morning.
Now, imagine how many people who work more than 40 hours a week we could have lifted out of poverty with all the money this spoiled asshole spent on this non achievement.  Tax The Rich.
Where was the air hostess with the tea?
Space travel isnt possible, you cant go any farther than this in "space"
Wait til every other month one of those falls down to its doom and we have to hear all the fake people cry about it.
how much for that 3 min ?
It’s strange but I feel so proud of you! 👍🏻
Loved it ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Спасибо брендсон за допэмиссию. Столько денег потерял вместо того, чтобы заработать
That was high altitude flying, not space. You can achieve the same gravity level on the vomit comet for a lot less.
humans cant freely travel on this planet
I want to see unedited, from inside the cabin looking at the passengers, from engine light to touchdown, please.
Cool
Bezos malding.. oh wait.
Coo.
congrats! love from Malaysia
Someday I wanna ride to this tube if I got the money.
Which camera recorded the seperation stage of aircraft from outside so clearly 🤔
cool!
Well even if only the rich get to go, maybe they will think it is a great planet and we need to look after it and they can influence others too..who knows
Fantastic!
Ale chybí mi návrat do atmosféry :D  , hoax ?

Rip flat earthers
Looks great! Sign me up
Let’s see ..on my income , convert to US$..hmmm yes yes …I should be able to afford this sometime in 2078
They must’ve carefully screened for passengers who wouldn’t vomit on livestream!
Wow. If only I could, I would take my husband and we’d have one heck of a 20th anniversary!!  Happy sailing to those who go and congratulations to you, Mr. Branson and your team.
This is an insult after the release what speed they travelling at? and why they don't show us the inside while travelling at such speed. @2:55 min when they re-strap hairs stop flying upward😂😂 just wasted 3min of my time

I am now 34. I am pretty sure it will be a normal thing to do when I will be 94. Hopefully even before :)
Это прекрасно.

I wanna go one day with my Family 🤩
Your guys are cool.. I will book for flight.
Truly a man with a Vision. Well done🇬🇧
Faker than covid
Global warming increase, billions suffer starvation, global pandemic, billions pushed into poverty. Billionaires become even richer and they can still play space man. So yippee
Our new heroe ….. A lot  of Energy wasted, just for fun …… how dare you, will the Little girl from sweden say
I'm glad you did it and survived.
not exactly the starship enterprise is it though
Shame he had to come back down really !
In video you see how much space garbage is there
Awesome
You can hear a pin drop at the flat earther convention lol  No doubt they will be claiming it's all CGI and crisis actors.
Oops you didn't go to space, you went to *the edge* of space.
Amazing👍
You gotta respect that
Release more footage please 🙏
how dare you do screw up my invest on you;.( :D:D:D:D
So u2 spy planes pilots need pressurized suits to survive at 70000feet but somehow everyone here is just fine with nothing at 50miles up? Even their pilots have something but not them lol. I though the iss was in the upper thermosphere at 240miles but these clowns are in space at 50 miles up? Sure. Just a plane in free fall that it.
Flat earthers  have left the chat.
Sirisha bandla an indian🇮🇳 woman  One of the member in this crew Proud of u madam
RIP Michael Alsbur.
Maybe world leaders should get sponsored by their countries to go up and see the planet from that vantage point. It would hopefully change their perspectives on how to run things.
We have so far too go for what we see in science fiction movies .gravity
Thumbs up to the pilots too!
Never stop dreaming and never let anyone say you can't. Congratulations Sir Richard!
Haven't they had these planes for awhile now? That drop and create weightlessness?
Amazing is the fact everyone needs to think about the climate, while the super rich can afford this much pollution, waste of money and energy, just for fun. 🙄
He was a high school dropout. Incredible.
Wow 😮 just wow 😯

Wow.. Amazing ,can see the earth's curvature
Wow it looks so flat!
You really just need family to go to space..
This just in : Virgins in space
Congrats  Now Dom Family can go to Space without using Cars
❤
The pilot looks to have better protection than the passengers. Why isn’t everyone wearing helmets ect?
two pilots and four mission specialists? .... they all just looked  like kids playing , how do you become a specialist in space tumbling?
How much does it cost to fly
I can just imagine what more human accomplishes I might get to see in my life. 😌
That is zero G but not space.
Impressive, but not impressed only because almost $100million of New Mexico's tax payer money went towards this project that a billionaire enjoyed. Yeah. I'm THAT guy. Rip me a new one if you like. I don't care.
oh god~that's pretty cool~
Это просто потрясающе😍
So they went into space without a rocket 🚀
Can you explain me about space boundaries. What it’s mean?
Eventually they will reach outer space. Not quite this time
nice
Fake
This beats the Euros
from that height they can see mans devastation of planet earth, well done you billionaires, maybe all that money could have been spent on saving a few amazonian trees but hey its all about you ,you and you...i do love the progress to extinction.....
Once a child with a dream, now a tax evading rich old guy who created a semi space plane for the insanely rich. This plane won't further mankind or get normal people into space. This is a rich mans fantasy and the money would've been better spent on making sure poor kids went to school and had a hot meal.
Wow ❤️❤️
u are my hero grandpa
thankfully i bought his stock ahaha :D when it was down because he is the only man who didnt fucking scream at all ppl "hey want that puplic attention!"
Should do a comp to enter to get a life changing opportunity to go to space.
Hopefully someone is making sure Jeffy isn't going to go all Epstein over his.
Besides the novelty and bragging factors, what's the point of riding into space for just three minutes of weightlessness? They're just frantically bumping into each other rushing to make the most of it.
Где деньги дедуля!!!
CGI 👍
I watched the actual event. Strange that all of this video footage wasn't aired during the actual event. 🤔 Does anyone know why?
What the……wow!!
What about Flat earth ?
Those reactions were very touching, I have to say. Well done Rich!
How did the space ship not burn up on re entry?
Lots of air bubbels , lol
Shut up and take my money!
Fake Fake Fake never made to 53 miles even above A12 Oxcart
THE COST IS NOTHING WHEN WE ONLY GET ONE CHANCE AT THIS LIFE "LIVE LIFE"!!!!!
Thank you big big
Billionaires: "If we could do this imagine what you could do"  General Public: we can't even afford college or buy houses because of you, we payed for your dream.
Is it just me or they haven't left the uppermost atmosphere at all?  Wake me up when the average joe can take a trip to the moon for $1.00
2:18, this is probably not the right time to check the window was fitted properly
Ok, now make it bigger with a first stage and carry passengers across the Pacific/Atlantic /Oceania. It would be the perfect replacement for the Concorde.
I guess anything is possible when you have money. 👍
Yeahhhh Amazing,beautiful!!!! GZ!!!  :)
I know my children will travel to space one day
Experience of a life time! I cant imagine what it must be like, my dream is to go to space one day, congratulations!
That's great, well done Richard!!
they didn't even cross Karman line and they call it space
The days our comming where the science fiction world is real. And they are coming fast
Ah ha! The earth IS flat!
Always useful to wear a parachute when you’re in a spaceship….
Our next generation is going to be living in the world we see in the science fiction movies. Imagine that marvelous world
During the Rocket Fire are they Blasted back in there seats?
Outstanding congrats Sir Richard
pure magic, once dreaming about being an astronaut, now just dreaming of being rich!
"Welcome to Space" I don't know what's more epic, to say that line, or to hear it as a passenger.
50,000 feet is just over 9 miles. Not even close to the 64 mile demarcation line of space.
He didn't even took his sunglasses off. What a pity(

Does this mean you don't believe in global warming? 🤣😂
I'm never tired of watching this so incredible
02:16 Let me out? :D
So.. can we compare this to spacex ? 🤔
Congrats. But That cabin is way too small! 😬👍
Love from 🇮🇳.
Well said Sir Richard Branson
Did they technically go into space if they didn't make at least orbital velocity?
How does Greta thunberg think about this? How much emissions it will cause??
I feel like this space tourism is quite cheesy. A few minutes at the edge of space, then fall back down. It's like standing on the observation deck at the Grand Canyon versus climbing down.
Wonderful
America!
Truly incredible. Those moments must be overwhelming of emotions. Elation. Fear. And all else at once.
Out of this world, kinda!

Amazing what you can do with wealth that you gained by exploiting everyone else.
Humanity doesnt deserve to leave earth
Congrats to Richard and the team who made this amazing achievement possible.
LOVE YOU Sir Richard!!!!  It's what you are doing for a great deal of our kids = future explorers
Amazing!! We are truly blessed to be part of this wonderful planet
Imagine flatearthers flying in this..
Is that Bono?
These new KSP graphics are insane!
Nice
The pilots have the best job ever.
Its amazing this is accessible to more people, but the funny thing is gravity at teh space station is 90% that of earth, they just feel weightless because the are falling towards earth at the same rate as the station. So this flight is no different, there is 98% of earths gravity at 80km, the became weightless as the craft rolled inverted and decended. Much like the vomit comet does at 10km. Otherwise if there was no 'gravity' you would be 12% lighter in a commercial airliner at 10km and weightless at 80km, which clearly isnlt the case.
Congrats everyone involved. This is just the beginning, you will go even  higher and further. 🖖🏻
1:38 feeling proud bandla
2:16 I was worried Richard would pull the window seal off!! 😂
People are dying from hunger and these cruel richest enjoying. You are zero not hero. If you removed poverty of 💯 s that will be great work and achievement as president XI did in china.
Great Human! Wonderful. Congratulation.
Can't wait to see space trips to be affordable to the public in the next 50 or 100 years. I wish i could live that long to experience it.
Awesome!
but they are never going to spend money in research of saving the nature and our ocean.  because we have enough resources in the galaxy.
Jeff Bezos is busy stealing 10 million in tax payer $$ & spying on Americans! Well Done Branson!
And how high did you go again?.
Where are those flat earthers now... Thi video shows round earth....Mr. Flat Earthers
I take it they are technically not in space but at the edge? What about re-entry? Doesn’t look like that space plane was made for re-entry.
this is so cool

Please more 4k footage! As much as you can!
👏 WoW just amazing 👏😍
800 flat earthers disliked this
Richard seemed so happy it brought tears to my eyes. Such a wonderful achievement for everyone!!
Amazing and inspiring. Great work Branson and team.
Who in the hell disliked this ???

Simply amazing!! A lifetime’s dream come true! Congratulations!!

Amazing footage. This is the first flight to space that resembles an Airliner flight.  Congratulations to Richard Branson and Burt Rutan for his brilliant design of the Ship.  Well Done! 👏🏻
Is it totally carbon neutral?
Anyone with the time details they spent in space??
You are not floating, you are falling!
Actually, the conventional limit of space is at 100 km, not on 80km…
Turns out the earth is round  Flat earthers must be kicking themselves
With all the negative publicity this is getting now from all the crazies, I just want to say this gives me hope of one day being able to fulfill a childhood dream of going to space.  Did he cross the FAI determined boundary of space?  no.  But he did cross the American definition of the beginning of space and that's all that matters to me.  He and his company achieved more than most people could dream of, and I hope to one day fly on either one of his or another commercially available craft to space.
2:49 this lady looks concerned
I love hearing the thrusters pop as they flip the ship
I've spent longer in the toilet.....and it cost less far lesss
Glad to see billionares having the time of thier lives in space. Hopefully they get lost in space!
I have a feeling many people will throw up doing this... I almost am just watching
But should we consider this in space or just the edge of our atmosphere?
Looks and sounds like a production as always.  If I was 30 years younger I would of swallowed this stuff right up
Looks like flight in the „Vomit Comet“ … just a few miles higher…
Where are all the satellites...…?
Earth glows majestically in the background just begging to be gazed upon,  passengers: " Hey look at me spinning in zero-G!"
This footage was sponsored by Oakley sunglasses!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And Depends.
Goosebumps for every Indian at 1:21 sec

2:00 wth is going on with that pump and thing on her leg? Looks comical.
The airbag and ABS brakes first appeared in luxury cars. This will trickle down to benefit everyone.
its amazing that entry into zero gravity that hair and people go up....seems 2d -1
Why no reentry vid?   Do they recieve any burn time when entering the atmosphere ?
Why did the pilots have to wear the oxygen masks but the passengers didn’t?
I think it's too short. At least 10 minutes needed in zero gravity.
Terraplenistas ahora que tienen que decir, ya pueden pagarse un viaje  y ver que solo pierden el tiempo  haciendo sus conspiraciones

Вы как умудрились акцию в понедельник на 15% уронить????
The most useless spacecraft since October 1957.
Why do the pilots need pressure suits and breathing apparatuses(like you would expect at those speeds) while your un athletic looking team of scientists seem totally unaffected by the g forces they should be experiencing? Legit question as I may want to use this in my own ttrpg fantasy games some day 😂😂😂
I'm sorry, but I find this boring. It's a regular take off and landing just like a plane, and short zero-G much less than a parachute jump. But it did cost a lot of money, work, and produced CO2 for no scientific outcome.
Wow...  this is fun & unbelievable.
I, too, have a dream, Mr Branson. I dreamed that my family will not starved and become homeless if I lose my job. I dreamed that I could afford to give my family a better life and a better future,  I dreamed that I could make the kind of money you paid for this one trip to space to play space-cowboy which would pay for my family's grocery bill for the next 200 years. Yes, I have dreams, too. But mine are down to earth while yours is that of a billionaire who will never understand what 99.9% of humanity have to face daily.
Wasn't Red Bull there years ago? I think Felix Baumgartner jumped from that height, I may be very wrong or pretty right...in either case the earth is beautiful from the stratosphere!
Love the tie fighter pilots driving the ship.
i like what hes doing, him and musk and bezos, its exciting
😅 Big congratulations!Richard Branson
Lucky
we will see this vid years from now and realize how far space travel has come
Unbeliveble eart is not flat 😂
Feel like we’re on a scary path on to finding something we shouldn’t be looking for in space. One day someone from earth will actually find another livable planet. Not in my time at least.
virgin is kinda cringy for a brand name
Bubble bubbly
We are shown all this in movies first so when they fake it we believe it's true.  Think of how many Hollywood movies you've seen about space.  I think space movies have been around since the beginning of movies.  Just like Virus outbreak movies.   Also, are you telling me after men have went to the moon (supposedly) this is how far they can go with all the new technology we have????????  So they basically did this to accomplish what?  To do the same stupid little floating around in the "spaceship" thing they always do in EVERY Nasa footage video???????  This is fake, people can't go to space.  It's just to distract you from what is going on like world wide lock down which has been getting worse and worse and doesn't seem to be stopping soon.  The fact that they still haven't went back to the moon makes this very suspicious.
Note to Sir Branson. You may want to add some handle bars around the windows so that that you can look out the windows and not drift around. I notice that you were trying to steady yourself by grabbing onto the rubber gasket around the window port.
This is just the beginning of things to come, Branson Is going to put as many people Into Space that he can before he passes the Torch "Please return to your seats and strap In" 2:38 Sounds like an ETICKET RIDE!
Selling $500M of shares a day after this?? Virgin is a SHAM!!!
Branson should offer a free flight to flat earther's.    This way it will shut them up once and for all.
Man,I have goosebumps,I hope I can go to space
Virtual hugs to everyone who is reading this comment 🙏❤️.
This is on my bucket list it will take a lot of education success investing hard work and perseverance but I will do it
Congratulations sir
Mehh 🙄you could've literally gone to space with real rocket, but you didn't
Ladies and gentlemen, the stars are open for business.
Indian ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😘😘😘
Oh come on! Their first time  in so called space, and they want to float and spin? Please🤦🏾‍♀️
I love my India
Why is Richard trying to remove that windows' rubber seal?
“I was once a child with a dream.” That hits different. ❤️
he had his little speech prepared and rehearsed like it was going to be some profound quote everyone would remember in the future. lol no one was even listening to him
This proves that the earth is flat
Now they are in Feather position
Flat earthers going to say this is fake 🤣🤣🤣
🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑music
Jesus will crush your pride and destroy your triumph....
Humans are so easily amused and impressed.....ACKK ACKKK AKK ACKK...!!!!!!
Richard Brandon is traying to get investments in the space he  finished with 🌎 earth
Wants UK tax payer to bail him out, then flies to space on a joy ride
Might be the most fuel efficient way of briefly seeing the Earth from almost space. Real space tourism would be a space station/hotel at some point, but this might be the best choice until then.
It's my 42nd birthday and what a thrill to see a day when civilians can actually (finally) reach space, if only for a few minutes.
Yeap... still virgin....
This reminds me of the movie Avatar, i'm gonna go watch it right now
THIS IS SO RAD !!! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸❤️❤️❤️
The moment is certainly historical, but only for one person and his ambitions. Competition in this industry is increasing and the company needs to try hard to stay afloat. Moreover, the cost of such an attraction is incommensurable with the income of many millions of living people, so this is a toy for the rich. And the funny thing is that when the rocket soared up sharply, the shares of the Virgin Galactic company fell sharply...have you seen this somewhere?!)))
It looks like a Gundam robot😯
People have been flying much farer for 60 years...It stopped at 2/3 of the way to the space.
AWESOME!!!   What fuel they used ?
Amazing.
Branson is a very clever guy and super talented but he has his team did not actually go into space, he was 53 miles up, space is 63 miles up, you can see space at 53 miles and become weightless but that's it. This was a pointless stunt at flying high in earth's atmosphere...not space flight at all.
A real orbit flight would be next step !
Re-Entry footage?
How much for a economy seat?
Lol they were going over 2000MPH and you're telling me they survived that G Force?
Wow thats a dream of mine unfortunately i wont ever make it but i hope my kids and grandkids so forth have this opportunity
Bet
Big congratulations Sir Richard Branson!!!!!! Virgin no more ♥️ 🎊🎉🍾🎈
So the Virgin Galactic is no longer virgin. 😃
Burt Rutan the genius.
Imagine if there was more space to move around, would be a lot of fun.
Why is the earth so brown? Because the big corporations destroyed our ozone. I wonder how much this Branson dream harmed our ozone. You can't fulfill your dreams at the detriment of billions of people
*дед накуканил всех инвесторов)))*
That is future space flight
What a joke! wake up people!
Fantastic!!! Congratulations!!!
The thrill of being a billionaire.... How many people work for six bucks an hour so these guys can enjoy life?
Sir Richard looked like he was gonna spew.
Wow, the anti-flat earth conspirators are really ramping up the propaganda.
Awesome, i remember having this dream when i was young too, congrads !
Promoción space Flight for super rico
Теперь надо придумать , как до высоты 400 км долетать , и тогда можно космический отель на орбите МКС сделать ;)
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Even if he wasn't technically in space....he was pretty close.
❤️ Borderless ... Unbiased ... Always giving : "Mother Earth"
Very very cool
Anyone catch Richard dodging the child’s  question about if he saw planets? He made up a stupid alien story
Nice, wish they didn't use fish eye lens cameras tho, you know the flat Esther's are gonna go nuts.
He's about to, boldly go where... many men have gone before.
El espacio está casa vez más cerca, que maravilloso ver este gran paso para la humanidad 😁
Earth flatters are you convinced now?? Clowns
Increible hasta donde ah llegado el hombre, con tanta tecnologia!!!
Like me who are from krushi high school
Who else thought Richard was trying to open the window?
In Memory of Micheal Alsbury.
Congratulations From AirAsia Malaysia
$250k a ticket. Maybe if I won the lottery
Love the fact that he took 3 younger people up with him, far younger than any that is ever allowed to fly with NASA.  Hopefully this will mean something. Something other than putting your life on hold for 20 years just to have a shot at this.
When it's land on the earth
That was the best cgi and acting i have seen in years .
Fisheye lenses? Really? Ugh...
can I hitchhike?
Congratulations!
Waste
For the wealthy only of course.
Then they drift off into space to never be seen again.
Great stuff.
After reaching  to space why u can't  mke sum video in space...when u land on space next pls do sum videos and keep sum space pics so the people  can enjoy...thq virgin  ....jet..❤
If you'd tell someone in 1975 that a man in 2021 would go to space just for a ride no one would believe you. No one. Power of technology and inspiring words from Richard, I love his passion🙏🏻 legend
When are we going to get a real iron man ?
Dreams become true, Congratulations!!!
Cool is an understatement. Happy it was a safe trip
Whoa! Someone actually went to space. Who knew people could do that?
因为他们是安全和快乐的旅程，特别是 srisha bandla 你的梦想暨真实❤
In my opinion: Space is beautiful but instead of spending billions to just see a view and feel zero gravity could we think about making our earth more beautiful, green, clean, problem free?   Everything is possible with money you can feed people, you can educate them, you can provide job to them, you plant trees and take care of it, you can stop all the bad activities.
Yawn!!
Sorry, not impressed.  This is just a really high airplane ride.  The "weightlessness" was just freefall back to Earth.  They were never close to being in orbit which would be my definition of being "in space".  I'm saving my money for a trip to the ISS.
'One small step for man, one giant leap for the billionaires'  Hahahahaha
Fake
Fake
Fake
Why spend millions ? You can get this feeling in just 10k
Congrats, wow!!!
What a waste of money for few minutes!! We got plenty of problems on earth within, let's take care of the wonderful planet your willing to see from the outside!!
Fake Martin Luther King . Smh
Dibuatin film bagus kayaknya nih
I'm a science nerd and loved the space race since i was a child, but this has gone too far. With all of the real problems we have on earth why spends billions on flights of fancy. What is the carbon footprint of these efforts? Using the justification that humanity might need a new home is a fools errand.
Jeff Bezos is so mad.
The democratization of space flight. Just like political democracies. Those who can pay, rule.
How is their experience in the flight totally different from a zero gravity site? I mean i get Branson actually went to space. But, he didn't stay there very long? He didn't live on a space station. It seems like an expensive trip that seems similar to the zero gravity flights? I watched Neil de Grasse talk about it and he said what Branson is doing is not really new as they did this kind of flight 60 years ago. It's an advance in engineering de Grasse said and beginning in space industry. But, wow it cost a lot of money compared to a zero gravity flight that seems similar.
So who were the other passengers?
Big deal. I thought he was really going into outer space. This isn't a space flight. It is an insult to all astronauts worldwide who have really flown into outer space.
This is fake according to flat earthers.
Has anybody found any actual footage from inside as they hit Mach 1-3 speed? Aren't people trained for exactly this kind of speed? Want to see inside footage of the full ascend
Great feat! Hope it becomes cheap enough for the majority to enjoy one day. Most likely not though.
Горизонт та ровный.....XD)))) Да нам показывают правду кто хочет тот увидит) Всех поздравляю) Братьям плоскоземельщикам отдельный))) 1 кадр специально для нас показали правду. Остальным зомби продолжили показывать изогнутую)
He isn't happy about going into space.. he's really happy because of all the military contracts he'll get for spy plane production! Virgin Mobile didn't work out too well for him in the long run so maybe this will save his image.
Hopefully they can extend the time in space longer, their only problem is that they might veer too far from their landing site. One option would be to create a landing pad in another state.
Holiday on Mars is closer and closer.
The vision is not clearly.visible..inside from it...maybe they need to foucus on it...in statisfied vision
And the winner! RICHARD BRANSON, oh wow dude you did it man you win!!
Finally, flat Earth's days are numbered. Normal folks can fly right up and see the curve! Well...for a bazillion dollars 😛
This is how among us starts
While you were up there i went fishing don't have that time to waste 🙄
This is indeed a sight to behold👍
Why do I see Indian flag at 1:21 , on her left arm xD  update - Ohh she is Indian - Sirisha Bandla, vice president of government affairs and research operations at Virgin galactic
Why are the pilots in breathing Masks and the passengers aren’t? Is it because theirs is pressurized? Anyone care to answer?
1:21 India 😱
Over Rated...
lmao the earths gotten a whole lot less round then the shots nasa has put out. You liars trying to re brain wash the population before they realize your full of the Brown stuff. All Liars will burn hey, remember that.
Flat earth folks are going crazy right now lol
not really in space so. no.
Still no footage from inside the cabin during acceleration, weird.
Awesome. We need more of this and less “culture war.”
Really want to see their reactions during rocket powered accent
You would have gained my trust and increased the credibility of the company if you actually used a rocket that launched. But nice to see this start of a new revolution! We will thrive!!!!
Thank u all
Pretty cool
Air flight!!!!@ wy nobody has normal camera's?
I am very inspired from it
Congregation
can it go on orbit? that would be cool tho
എജ്ജാതി മനുഷ്യൻ 🔥🔥🔥🔥👍👍
👍
This is great but SpaceX has already done this so this is not all that great..and Nasa did this also so im glad to see you did a great job buddy but Elon has done this already!! and SpaceX is way beyond you already!!
why does richard looks as if hes holding diarrhea lmao.
Couldn't they have made the pilot's helmets a little more like SPACEBALLS the movie?? :):)
Bravo!
😮😮😮😮 Soooooo cooool! So proud of the achievement, accomplishment, smoothness, lady cosmonauts, and the mark in history. Branson, you just moved way back up in my hero ranking. I can see you’ve been quietly working away, at making some out of this word dreams come true. Bravo, everyone. I am tearfully moved.
Human Beings are incredible
😃👏👏👏👏👏👏👏 felicitaciones !!!
The pilot has to do this every day....  that's a lot of flight risk lol
Hey! Can I hitch a ride soon?
Boss
I’ve been to Space Before. 1976. It’s a Long Story 😂😂😂😂
Lol virgin
I think this much better than Bezos'
This is my dream 😍😱😱
Vomit comet! Fake!
Way cool. But, the windows need grab handles around them.
Omg, $250k for a trip to space? I’ll sacrifice my 401k, but the moment the price drops, I’m doing it!
He should’ve said the earth isn’t flat lol
Proof that the earth is indeed ROUND!!  🤣
In Quran,Almighty Allah told us that, he who creatd this earth as a bed/carpet. So earth should be flat.But this video cant be accepted. This is fake video..
Why would anyone dislike this video... it’s amazing! Congratulations! 👏🏻
My gf once hit me with a pan and I had was in space for 30 seconds .. clearly saw stars and moon up close
Where is flat earthers ?
Looks like a buncha kids in their first bouncy house, lol....Awesome!
Nothing impossible. It is like movie. You guys made it real. Congratulations to virgin galactic team.
for such a history making event, the edits in this video were absolutely painful to watch after having seen the actual event, the burn on the engine lifting the vehicle to the edge of space was of a much longer duration than in this fragmented clip. There were a lot of people that witnessed a 50 second burn, and some were praying that nothing bad would happen, praying for 50 seconds seems like an eternity, and thankfully everything worked, and Phew! A genuine sigh of relief was heard as the "fun" began.
Modern Day Howard Hughes, since the beginning when he 1st announced his plans I knew it could be done !!!
Flat earthers will say that it's CGI 😅
That women’s joy is infectious. It makes me smile with joy with her and the crew! You can tell she’s totally living in the moment like a kid in a candy store :)
Looks like the plane falling back to earth! I don't think that's 0-G.
Take his knight hood away please -  Let him go live Merkle in America- & why didn’t he build and fly from the  UK?
How many  died to make his dream come true - I think the count was 5 pilots
incredible !
Just a Roller coaster ride . Jerks didn’t even go around the earth  Such a joke .. it might even be fake
Congrats! So inspirational mankind is using updated technology to achieve what he already achieved many, many, many times FIFTY YEARS AGO. Oh wait...🙄
0:52 Sirisha making India proud!!!
Lies!!!! Not real ,just like all others
Mans really just achieved his dream, big ups 👏
Congratulations, did u see any alien ships out there that made u wow.. or only earth !!! . thought u saw something else
When science fiction becomes reality
Amazing, a new era of spaceflight is happening right as we comment!
Earth is flat
It’s an incredible achievement but how about using your billions to combat world hunger, better education and getting Covid vaccines to less-fortunate countries, Branson??
Playing with the big boys is the real pleasure ! 🤗😆😉
I can't wait until I can afford to go to Space, probably never :( Happy for Richard. I know he worked hard for this.
2:16 don't open the window!
سؤال كيف يتم تصوير الخارجي يعني اي هناك طائرة اخرى تتبع الساروخ من الارض حتى خارجها استغباء
Wow awesome congratulations !
Fake news 😂
Wow wow wow
"this is all a simulation. camon people I looked into this ! those so called windows are HD screens !"   eddie bravo
the year is 2099, tesla and vg are at endless war for  control of the edge of space and all the mutant-human hybrids immune to the radiation bombarding every living organism outside the troposphere rebel from their full-blood overlords, creating a primitive propulsion drive to return to the tribal earth reclaimed by nature's innocence and the industrially manufactured ices of the new arctic position.
Ok the world is a Matrix
FAKE😭😭😭😭😭😭
Remembering the crew of Spaceship Two.
The eart is flat confirmed??!!! /s
Too cool!
It's cool.... until he sold all his stocks the next day and messed up the market.....
Mind blowing! Congrats!
Not bad for an old hippie that started out with Tubular Bells in his ears...
Wonderful!!!
LOL, I thought they were in space, those fools are just really high.  Hahhahahahahha  I'm not a flat earther but come on, we are not stupid.  That is not space.
Congrats!
the earth is not flat !!!
Indian flag in the space. It's on the arm of that girl.
Jeff Bezos watching this: [wipes jealous tears away with a wad of $100 bills]
That would be an inopportune time to have gas, locked in a capsule in the vacuum of space.
Flat earthers are so triggered now.
This is one of the coolest channels on youtube...
“Please return to your seats and strap-in for re-entry” must be the coolest and most sci-fi phrase to ever become real 🤩
Wow, he makes it look EASY🙏🌏
Congrates, also who want to see the @sidemen go to space or react to this video on @sidemenreact
save your stock
Woww…amazing!
This is insanely incredible!!! Roll that whole clip with Interstellar BGM.. 🚀
You gonna show us inside the cab during the burn or what?
You can tell this video is fake because the earth is a pancake not a spherical globe🙄
What does this all mean… Virgin Galactic is part of NASA ? Is this spinning off another automobile? Or is this a separate space initiative ? Are there space rules ? 👩‍🚀🧑‍🚀👨‍🚀🚀
No wonder we have global warming it's like it's only desert no green on the Earth from space
Hopefully, they'll take the leader of some flat earther organization up there so the idiot can see with his own eyes the planet's a sphere.
BOOOOOOORRIIINNGG! let me know when you launch a 20 story building into space, then I'll be impressed.
Well I guess some congrats are in order ! Is that it ? Or do we all get some tickets in the next few years?
All those billionaire should build a space station for people to go onto...imo
Wow!!  Screw it Let's Do it.  Great job Sir Richard!
Felicidades!  Mazel Tov! CONGRATS!!!!!!!
Branson 🫖 teabagged SPCE shareholders with a $500m offering since his ride didn’t explode 🤯.  SucK on not chew on that old democrat nut Sack. Ark given a heads up. Looking up from that crockpot. 🐊  BNGO$ Billionaire Maker.
Happiness,  never in my wildest dreams!  Enjoy it and do everything it takes to populate Moon, Mars, and other planets, I dream of figuring out gateways, imagine just walking to the other side of the galaxy.  I want to live that time.
This is fake, the earth is round, and the moon is made of cheese.
I remember when they wheeled a TV into my Kindergarten room one day back in 1969 and I watched the Apollo 11 lift off ...and now, almost exactly 52 years later, Sir Richard Branson has equaled that same overwhelming thrill I felt as a 5-year old!!!  This is indeed another "giant leap for mankind"!!! Congratulations to the entire Virgin Galactic Team on job truly well done!!!
Badass, one of the best days ever in my life.
Great video.  Thanks for sharing!  So inspiring!
Oh man I want to see the face expressions while the burn
Awesome looking craft as well!!!!👍
Srisha bandla rock s
Then richard pulls the window gasket off.
..starving and homeless all over the earth....and billionaires pissing away the resources to experience weightlessness...w.t.f. is going on...
Only for the rich and famous, absolutely no value to mankind. BTW, THERE IS NO SOUND IN SPACE
Congrats, quite the accomplishment.
Compared to Elon, Branson is so aboriginal!
Tenho pena dos terra planistas...sqn.
next,honeymoon on space
Glorified plane rides (billionaire pi$$ing contest). "Space" begins at the moon. Go there, and I'll start paying attention.
I thought this was a non-event. You could basically do this in a Russian Mig for many years now for $20K
.
congratz
"To the next generation of dreamers: If we can do this, just imagine what you can do!"  - Sir Richard Branson,  visionary.
You did it, congratulations 👏
What a horrible display of absolute greed.
Looks like the interior could use a few strategically placed handles.
Masya Allah, amazing
I’m still a child with a dream and depends 🤣
you need to remove all the bot from these comments so I can promote my music🙄
0:55 I like how they have a net behind the pilots to keep the free floating passengers out of the cockpit. Also like how this state of the art private space plane has propeller driven chase planes accompanying it back to the runway! 3:11.
THAT IS SO AWESOME!!!! 👍👍👍👍👍👍👏👏👏👏👏👏
They should qualify for astronaut wings
Never thought they would shoot a virgin into space and Michael Cera wouldn't be a part of it...
250 grand huh better start saving
Truly amazing
Thank You Sir Richard, to dream big and live and love your dream. Always very inspiring to see reality  come in place of the dream and results are way better then imagination . Gratulation, best to you Family and teams and dreams
unbelievable but too short experience. if i have to pay 300K for a flight ticket, it must be much longer!
it would be cool if it exploded
2107131015
2:08  UFO  👽
I was here :)
Wow...Amazing
Soo you made the planet that much more warmer so you and a few people could feel weightlessness in the earths mesosphere? Way to go. Nice to see that white privilege card being used.
Richard, please confirm... did you see the Flat Earth?!!
Human Beings are incredible
Imagine being stuck up there with those dorks :/
The pilots of Unity have the worlds best Dream Job.
It's this fake
0:09 reminded me of beavis
When are they going to space ?🌎
Aliens in their spacecraft: Pfft amateurs 😂
Flat earth???    Lol
Time to make more money from space
So THIS is what my tourist Kerbals experience as I fly them into space on KSP.
👉If we can do this just imagine what you can do.👈 This is the best line in space exploration next to the famous giant leap for mankind quote by Armstrong.  I seriously applaud you Sir Branson.
Bit akward mess in zero gravity. Lack of time to enjoy it is affecting everyone. Looks live vomit comet will be more fun, except the lipft up, Mach 3 an the view.
Too cool!
An amazing achievement, but 17yrs and who knows how many billions of dollars, just to fly sub-orbit on the edge of space for a few minutes. An almost inconceivable waste of money.
Can't wait for people to say this Is fake and the earth is still flat lol
Makes you wonder why with billions to spend Branson has not done a airliner sized ship with it's own power to do sub orbital flights by now? Carrying say 300 people at a time would open up the experience to far more people by lowering the cost of the tickets because that's what orders of scaling up does!  So instead of a few mega rich doing it in a tiny craft it could be hundreds doing for so much less in cost.  The big one could be built as a space plane/normal airliner with rocket engines built in the back to put it into a sub orbit without a carrier craft to take it up.  But as per normal only the the mega rich matter no matter the sales blah and lofty words about letting normal people enjoy the micro gravity times.  And since Sir Richard has let his airline go out of business even though he had the money to save it, I think he needs to make up for that loss with a bigger space plane scaled as big as the airlines he allowed to die just because he did not with the fund that anymore and instead invest in Virgin Galactic system.
i lost my  job as a pilot thanks to covid.....spare a dime?
I want to see the faces with the engine reaching 3G power. There's no chance someone would faint in this process?
More fakery from a master mason conman...
He’s right. If you have billions of dollars kids, you can do anything!!
Please post the cabin video as the candle was lit!  I was looking forward to seeing, the s@@t-eating grin on Sir Branson's face as they sling up through the Kármán line...  Congratulations, that's one hell of a ride you've put together! *starts saving coins*
ooooo very nice
i want to see the uncut footage of them strapping themselves back into the seats
Wow they did it
What happens if you don't get back in the seat in time
Any flat earthers? For now what I can do is laugh at them and congratulate the Virgin team!
Buy buy buy nio and spce virgin galatic
National heros
That's cool.
what a trip
How amazing is that!? Congratulations!!!
Flat earth people are now hiding in shame
Awe inspiring! Congrats on an incredible voyage and for packaging it up so well here
SPACE....LMAO
To those that believe that the earth is flat, there is your proof that is not. Some people don't even believe in the electricity.
The space shot reminds me of interstellar
My teachers said when I was a kid that we would all be able to travel in space when we were adults.   Sir Richard Branson, you proved my teachers right.
we can now say we send a virgin to space
The purple leather conversly talk because afterthought consquentially settle worth a thinkable edge. mixed, ubiquitous colombia
where are the bags stored, in case someone needs to hurl?
牛逼
" this is Branson to mission control we have a code brown  in my space suit "💩
How many airline points I need for this? Is there standby?
Thanks for dunking 500 million on investors
Amazing
Awesome!
....That was a free falling. Not 0 gravity.
WHERE ALL THE FLATEARTHER karens :D :D :D
Only the Fat Cats get to do this.
Richard, Richard!  Inquiring minds want to know!  When you were up there, answer the question many Americans have.....is the Earth flat?
we don't get to see there faces when the booster ignites?  i think that would be the coolest to see the G's
That's is flat
Nice CGI. all the simpletons will believe this for sure lol
5 - 4- 3- 2-1...Thunder Birds are GO!
You see that the earth is flat
Great job Sir!
Palhaçada de gente rica.
How many thousands of tons of carbon emissions was generated for what will be nothing more than a carnival ride for the elites.  Don't talk to me about global warming, reef die offs, wildfires, species extinction,  or any of the other impacts when egomaniacs engage in this behavior.
This is so fascinating.....
one thing i've noticed, unity has no bars where you can hold or grab when you are in zero G. they should add more to avoid collision between the crews. and please add also bars in the windowside so that the crews have no difficulties watching the earth from space with zero gravity.
Richard Branson giving up some of his flight time to give a speech to the next generation of dreamers is a testament to the greatness of this man. Congratulations to the whole team!
Congratulations, Mr. Branson and team!
Pilots were like: do your thing now. We only have few minutes before we fall back to earth.
This is my dreams made real. I have literally dreamed f flying to and viewing space repeatedly for years but never as a kid, only since my early 20s , but up until recently. But I was always a kid in my dreams weirdly enough! the machine was completely different to this beautiful craft though... it was a almost the same inside but it was a mess outside. It was just made of baked bean cans with the labels still on and welded together!  But those were the dreams when I felt a real, genuine sense of loss when I woke up and realised it hadn't really happened and even worse, that it would NEVER HAPPEN. EVER. Man, that was the worst! And if I ever did get the chance,  or if I could ever afford to take the trip, I would make sure I went with my Daughter,  Ellie, so that I could tell her AWAY from the planet Earth and away from anyone interfering,  how much I love her and what she means to me away from all the drama that exists on our planet and then showing her what a perfectly beautiful place it is and can be too!
Sir Branson has his own demons, as we all do. But I am happy to congratulate him and all of the scientists, engineers, technicians, and maintenance workers who made this possible. Commercial space flight has arrived, and having seen the other companies styles of completing this feat, this might be the most appealing, although it doesn't go as high. Weightlessness is weightlessness. I wonder if they have already developed ways to increase the time at or around apogee.
🚀🚀Congrats. 💞🌟🌟💋🌹
Well done!  An amazing accomplishment!!
Wow! The randomised suicide/murder rocket manages not to kill anyone this time. Amazing!
Imagine if the International space station was going past at the same time Unity 22 was up in space and they caught some of the flight on their cameras that would be cool.
Congrats!!!! BTW, was the earth flat or round?
When I interview candidates for a position in my company i ask them who I would choose to be my partner Sir Richard Branson or Lord Sugar !  My favourite saying when I’m explaining my role and responsibility within my company is that Sir Richard Branson doesn’t fly his planes !  Congratulations Sir to you and your team !!!
I really hope they played David Bowie - Space Oddity while in there :D
They don’t go high enough I probably sound rude but I can’t be the only one
Felicidades-Congrats !
That would be freekin’ awesome.  Congratulations on making it happen.
No space suits !!!
Well done Virgin Galactic! Well done! Those views of planet Earth are STUNNING!
No doubt This is where the rich will be hiding like rats eating popcorn come WW3
Take that flat earth. Look at that curve
I can feel their joy, fear, excitement, all at the same time, what a truly beautiful experience.
Congratulations 🍾
SURREAL! I want a ticket.
Great   Congratulation   Space for All
Congrats to everyone involved that’s awesome to see 🙏🏼👍🏼
cuma setakat melepasi tarikan graviti je,nampak belum sampai ke ISS lg.
Sir Richard's hand was literally shaking in space but It was unbelievable experience for him. Excellent job <3
Mashaalloh
If ever the world needed to be viewed for the stunningly amazing creation that it is, it is RIGHT NOW!  When we are at one of our lowest points we can be be reminded of what a truly beautiful place the planet Earth really is. We needed this.
Successful flight. So why did you sell all those shares in your company Sir Richard?
Does anyone reckon they'll get this to go from LA to NY?
This entire video is fake
How long were they up there?
my dream..never to happen but hey...
These are one of the few moments where you can’t help but smile
nice...
Is this is just a $250000 carnival ride for the rich?
What damage does this cause to our Ozone layer?
The only rich man that puts experience over possession! Live it up doll 4 all of us & ty Joan, so cool even when ur knees R knocking!
I’m curious to know what a fart is like in zero-gravity? Does it linger longer?
Amazing, congratulations!
The warm bomber markedly marry because pull gully fail underneath a complex knife. flashy, superb trail
fake curvature!
So not to be a killjoy or anything but really this thing has no practical applications right? It's essentially a joyride for the rich?
So what? 🥱 Looks like a bore!
Cutting the engine to freefall for gravity effect. That wasn't space.
AND THE EMMY GOES TO ......The studio with the fake rocket ship!   WHAT AN OBVIOUS  PHONY, AND A FRAUD!
The EARTH LOOKED CONCAVE! NOT FLAT!!! :D
Every time I see this I tear up. It's so great that this may be available to everyone someday.  Now I just need to save up!
At some point in the near future not only will the engineering and technology of this spacecraft change, but the price will. I predict in short of the next 20 years these tickets will cost somewhere around $5000 usd, who knows though there couldn't be too many people who wouldn't want to do this, in that case prices may stay in the extreme high range. We will see, do what's right people.
Pissing competition
What is the point of this
And people are DYING on Earth. What a gucking waste of money and resources.
Congratulations!
From the other videos from the ground, it appeared as if right as the lady says " Congratulations, you are now in space " only 10 -15 seconds goes by before she says it is coming back down.  Was some of the video trimmed in those, because I just now watched the entire video, and see that he did INDEED go to space !  Congratulations !  I hope the flight was dedicated to that fellow that died a few years back testing this.
Wow
I get same feeling taking the subway in New York…..your life is living on the edge!
Just curious if anyone knows as to why the lady was pumping her leg?
Que experiência fantástica.
Congratulations to all human kind. Thou it is more like a rich people’s game……and it’s flight only reaches its peak attitude ~50miles….
Is this the same Richard Branson that begged the  UK government for bailout money for his airline?  Seems to have a few billion bob he could have used to get him through the covid crash. Pay your debts you corporate leech.  I don’t knock on your door to pay my credit card bills.  Don’t knock on our collective door when you piss money way on useless ventures like this
Congradulations and much respect to every single person  that was involved with this. You know you believe in your mission and product when you are on the first ship north.  I believe space tourism trips are gonna be the new bragging rights for those with deep pockets.  I'm a huge fan of gliders so I really enjoyed the trip back to earth. ☮
Congratulations! Any plans for orbital flights in the future or is that out of scope?
UAU !!!!!
I'm confused, We went ot the moon in the 60's. Why is this a big deal? Congrats anyway still a big accomplishment
Is it x wing? W wing?
What a great man
and everyone is fretting about them selling shares 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄, i was waiting for this very clip.... looks wonderful!
Great! In other news Conor mcgregor got renamed to conor mcstretcher.
Fake Faked Fake
Flat earth believers, book your seat please.
Branson achieved so many dreams in a lifetime.
Congrats
The new elite pastime: party in space
Branson showering in the morning singing "I'm a rocket man"
Where are the Flatearthers? 🤪🤣
wow ....
Maaaan..Crackhead’s have been doing this for years...🤣😂...hit that Pipe and its Beam me up, Scottie.
When  Richard Branson plays astronaut, thousands of people get minimum wage in his companies.
Can I pay with doge-and can I take a big toke off this gorilla glue #4 vape pen😎 when we start to float...
Congrats!
im really nervous they didnt show us the landing.....maybe a cover up?
Earth is flat....that is all....
More for the rich to blow cash on...   well done LOL You kinda almost touched space.
Congrats.
Such a beautiful thing
Porque choras terraplanistas??????
The new millionaire 's playground...
Absolutely astonishing
Congratulations 🇱🇰
flat earthers eat your hearts out
Congratulations for all your and your team’s hard work and achievement! 👏👏👏👏
Congratulations
SGK uyir♥️
And now the price of hatch chili’s goes to space too!
This is an inspiration for us all.  Keep flying high Virgin Galactic, you're paving the way for the future!
Incidentally, my other post here is clearly sarcasm when I refer to the earth as flat.  Lets how many people take the bait to respond there.
I'm still not impressed. 🙄😏🥱 do some jumping Jack's, ok now stand on your head,  spin around three times. ..
It’s funny that people think space is real lol. Life is a hustle and people are suckers.
Wait, the Earth is flat though and those windows aren't windows, they're 8k LED screens.  And  Richard is not floating, he's hanging just like the others in the tube that sits in an airport hanger somewhere.
It is truly an amazingly great thing HOWEVER they technically didn't go into outer space. They went into the mesosphere which is still inside earth's atmosphere. They still have to get through that pesky thermosphere and then the exosphere to reach outer space. Still awesome tho.
share offering not even 24 hrs later, ill never invest another dollar in this pos
I'm disappointed that it isn't called the Galactica. Missed opportunity there.
Ultimate flex in richie rich people, who believe natural selection is something anyone can obtain... reach for the stars everyone
Juste Amazing. I remember a few years ago thé story begining. Today isreally
Only weightless due to free fall. Not in zero gravity
Where are the FLAT EARTHERS
Um... " high altitude flight" actually. Let's not get carried away.😏
He sure didn't stay up very long !  ( Hey - That's was SHE says ! )
As long as my stock goes up...
I already bought a ticket , and next Sunday , I will have my Virgin spaceflight. Ps.Just kidding (maybe next 200 years )
Very  cool to see.  Congratulations to the team!
Amazing guys... always been fan
the glob is plan shashasha
The use of a fisheye lens at 1:15 is really necessary to give the viewer the accurate experience - right?
GG !
I heard this is the interesting idea that elon posted on twitter
Richard: hehe… money go boom 🚀🚀🚀
Richard has made many many people envious and as I type I'm joining them....I do hope the prices will come down, $250,000 is a lot of money for a 15 minute flight from drop off and into space and back down again....
Ue, a terra  e redonda???
Wow 🏁🎉
Space. The first frontier.
🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
I would do it for $1000 because that's all I can afford right now. But it looks awesome!
Commenting for YouTube algorithm
That's AWESOME
I would like to see the faces of the people when that rocket fires and the G,s hit
What a pretentious thing to say as a billionaire, we would and could do all the thing you do if you didn't hoard all the fucking money.  You could literally end world hunger but instead you'd rather take part in your space hobby
Congratulations Astronauts!
Flat Earthers breaking into cold sweats everywhere.
Wow excellent and amazing...
1:43
Thumbs down. Just a low budget nasa. Theater tricks for the public. Just like nasa. Wow they flew in a plane.
Awesome!
What beautiful earth? We've done everything to pollute and destroy it. A hard rain is going to fall . . .
Too sad this is not "space" yet. Still 90k missing, but already very close
Very cool. Cannot wait for regular tours in space! Saving my money for a ticket!  Not sure why folks mad at the billionaires making space flights available for non-astronauts. Not like they were spending their money on charity before they decided to try to go to space.
I am so proud of you and your team Sir Richard,  I watched all your record attempts growing up, the balloons, the boats, the channel crossing , all of them, this is the icing on the cake of an awesome life, thanks for sharing your voyages and journeys with the world. 🇬🇧   🌍  🌎  🌏
Very nice, but can this thing actually go into an orbit around earth, or is it just a few moments of fun? Cos if it can't it's just a very expensive and environment-damaging toy for billionaires, and not something that contributes to science. Build something that can carry people and/or payload into orbit around the earth or further or don't build anything at all.
Fantastic! Look what "we" can do! Thank you for reminding us!
Let the guy out of the trunk.
Billionaires don't wear helmets? Yall believe this to be real? His money HASNT bought my Common Sense... NONE of those people, including HIM, have ANY SORT of Safety Equipment nearby... does that Seem REAL to You?!???  (NO Air mask, no face shield...) Heck. I wore more safety equipment walking into KROGER, to return Pop Bottles...!
How come they couldn’t stay up there longer. Was it lack of speed?
Well done Richard 👏👏👏👏👏👌
Branson 🥱
Cool spent alot of money just to float around for 1min n then fall back to earth...cool
SpaceX is currently slow clapping. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Thank you Sir Richard Branson to put your money on this kinda business to inspire next generation of space explorers! Thank you Virgin! Awesome video. ❤️
BEST WAY TO DO IT! MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT! CONGRATULATIONS!
Vaybe. Doğruyu söyle dünya düzmüydü yoksa yuvarlakmı? Buzulların ötesinde topraklar varmı? Gördünüz mü?
Don't know what's worse: Science-fiction. BS reality television. Billionaires, giving us lowly people, a delusional sense of reality. Whatever became of space-plane transportation, as often published in Popular Mechanics in the 1980's. With aerospace companies(billionaires), saying mass space transportation would be viable by the year 2010. Reality check: won't be available till the year...2200?
Notice here again a use of only fisheye lenses that curve all objects.
He was then driven back to his huge house in his planet fucker mobile
that is amazing!! I wish I was on that flight!
GGWP
Congrats And thank you for what you are doing!  We need more people like this!,  I will continue dreaming of mankind on other planets!
The birth of the OPA is now! Outer Planets Alliance for life!
Welcome to new millionaires JolyRide... If futility have a name Branson and Besos should be it...Masters of building practically useless billion dollar toy's... This is way this world is crumbling when people with millions prefer to spend them on selfish egocentric projects than do it for the well-being of people or the planet...
Manipulator...
CONGRATS !!!
Amazing!
Seems fake. lol  So, how long were they “in space”?
Marvelous….
I would not call that space just barely high enough to experience weightlessness for a few seconds.  There not even wearing pressure suits that should say enough.
Congratulations mr Branson! Your dream came true!!!
Somehow i feel so happy for him. Cheers Richard!
Где деньги Зина?
man, it's amazing! one man - one dream. my respect👏👏👏👏👏👏
The happiest faces for the Day. Well Done!
Congratulations.
Did you k now that there is a road in Nc called Branson Mill Rd, because there was a colonial mill on it, the owners were ancestors of his
Rutan
Let's hope this will put the end to all the flat Earth retards out there.
circus side show foreign liberal 🤡
Congrats! As other visionaire once said - "Only people, who are crazy enough to think, they can change the world, are the ones who do"
Beautiful, but scary as heck! Luckily i don't think it will be affordable for me to think about in my lifetime...what an amazing acheivement by all involved!
BIG DEAL .SPACE  WTF.
space? thought it was the "EDGE of SPACE"?
1:41 = FLAT EARTH 1:44 = CONCAVE EARTH 2:20 = ESPHERIC EARTH  FISHEY LENS, MANUFACTURE ILUSIONS....
They are so happy, hard work payed off. Now start making advanced nuclear reactors because we have to end with pollution before it is too late.
I am born in january 1969 i had 6 months old when Man walk on the moon. I always had the dream to view Earth from space before i die. With sir Branson and Virgin Galactic it's becoming real. So now how Much IT cost to go in Space ? Congratulations to team Virgin Galactic 👍
I wanna go. Only missing $149.999,-
Welcome to Space Virgin Galactic

Thank you so very much for sharing the cabin recording. I loved the live cast but we didn't get to hear Sir Richard's message due to signal issues.  Thank you all for sharing this wonderfully inspiring moment.
Sir, Congrats and happy for your successful flight.

Achieving this in my lifetime!!👍👍👍👍👍 Well done Richard Branson. I can’t see Elon Going to space in the Starship just yet; lets hope Bezos will be up there too very soon. But the Starship is a much bigger project and at least a couple of years away from maturing as a project, but Elon has launched hundreds of satellites and delivered crew and supplies to the international space station.
2:15 He's trying to escape.
How Many g's when roket start?

Everyone keeps dreaming...
The rollercoaster to space
Love to do this with my family .  Hope it becomes affordable in my lifetime ! Finally some happy news online
They say that the earth is flat but I see it as round, what happened then?
What are they all wearing parachutes for? with the whole flight, there is only a small window in the whole trip that they could be used in an emergency.
wooohhh! let's goooo
Very low orbit, go out more and stay a few days.
Земля в иллюминаторе, земля в иллюминаторе, земля в иллюминаторе видна! ... Ну что сказать? Молодцы!!! Поздравляю!!! ;)
Но в космосе так и не побывали! Линия Кармана не пересечена!!! Фуфло!🤣😈

Fantastic and inspiring words. Well done to you, your dream and all the engineering behind it.
Looks like I won't be telling my kids faster than light travel is not possible  after what Richard Branson and company achieved.
💙 🙌
HE HAS DONE IT!!!!!!!!
A few handles by the windows would be nice !
Congratulation! Another milestone for the full conquest into space travels! I hope this company will opening soon a spaceport in Italy!
Aliens in the tic tac: that's cute.
When NASA hears “release release release fire fire fire” yea there idiots with no control.
Amazing.  Sign me up.  Oh, I forgot it cost $250 mil.
I hope he brought one of the lunatics flat earther and showed them that the earth is curve then throw it outside.
Congratulations 👏
2:15 looks like he was trying to open the window and then ​gave up when he realized haha
Congrats! Did Richard forget to use both harnesses when told to strap up? I only saw 1 over shoulder.
im assuming the 'weightlessness' was simply due to the passengers and craft falling?
Yeah that’s not space.
Congratulations.  What an amazing accomplishment.
ЗдоровО ! Молодцы !
Flat earthers where you at...
Mas para isso o matores seria 10x mais potente,,e combustível 10x mas do que esse que e levado, e também  mas conforto para tripulação, para não fica espremido,,,, o protótipo que levaria essa nave deveria  se também ampliado 10x para pode leva a anave  ampliado 10x o tamanho,,, agora vamos construir esse projeto 10x amaiore melhor para fica mas tempo no espaço
amazing
Welcome to space!.... Just kidding, you didn't pass the line try again
Congratulations  👍
The spacecraft needs handles next to the windows
When the spacecraft is released there isn’t a single video out there i fond that shows inside of the cabin when they are experiencing massive G force.. too bad its poorly edited
I'm gonna book economy and hope for an upgrade on the day.
Muito bom, sonho concluído,, z agora É só fazer uma nave 10x maior do que essa ai para ter mas espaço  de frutuar,  e também ir mas longe fazendo uma expedição espacial,,,,,, aí ficaria muito bom
They can't go any higher because nothing can get past the dome..
How many thousands of money would I need for a trip like this
Edge of space. Let me know when they have hotels on the moon.  👽
Forgot to add handholds…opps
What a joke 😂
Pure entertainment. We should think about combating climate change and preserving biodiversity rather than space tourism. Please invest the money there. Thank You.
Where did they hide the vomit bags?
Хобби нормального миллиардера, а у нас в России идиоты за те-же деньги покупают яхты(((
Definitely Branson was a Thunderbirds fan
Missed seeing their faces at drop and burn That would be entertaining, lolol...
how much is the ticket lol
why the stocks down today??
Increíble, felicidades para ese logro histórico, me gustaría ir....
Is taking a plane ride really high actually considered going to space. Its More like a thrill ride
Pretty impressive.....know what will really impress? Clean up all the litter we make...that will really impress.  Just watched some guy film the slums in Peru that float on top the Amazon river, absolutely filthy and sad.
Wonderful dream; even better reality.
Let me know when you actually get to space.
Yes, the earth isn’t flat
As if the seat belts would've mattered had something gone wrong!
So now rich people just up and leaving Earth! Lawd help us! Peace!
Why without helmets? Athmonauts :)
Галя, давай хотя бы 55 долларов за акцию)
Great achievement
How comes they did not need any oxygen masks?
Branson> To all you kids down there i was once a child with a dream,,, if we can do this just imagine what you can do Yeaa,,, now quick pass me a sickbag 🤢
Quase morro  de ansiedade  ontem 😎😄😅😃🤣😁😀😍
Old Nazi technology.  They devoloped something similar in the 1940's
I wonder when how many more flights until there's the inevitable mishap.
They had paracutes incase
2:16 Was Richard trying to escape lol
Congratulations Sir Richard Branson and all involved with this success and for continuing to inspire!!!
Я считаю это первый человек частник смог зделать всех,и Америку и весь мир!
Just curious, but can't you do that in a normal jet? I don't see anything special about this. Sorry, I'm not impressed.
No virgins anymore!
I'm surprised no one carries camera!
Flat earthers are screaming right about now
Historical Moment
10 miles short of space and only one fifth the distance to ISS. ( so still a Galactic Virgin )  It's a start but the best bet is SpaceX and their delivery of astronauts to ISS. They also used a reusable launch vehicle and have successfully tested a reusable Starship for a Mars mission.
why do we never see the view from inside when under boost.. i wanna see what its like flying to mach 3 in seconds :)
Realise the full video for flat earthers with no cuts or edits
well technically they didn't went to space. Space starts at 100km high, they clim to 80 km "only".
Fantastic Richard. you are great person, plus English, we have won more than football having you. Thank you,  :)
Laying off thousands of people during the COVID crisis. Meanwhile, having a tourism space flight! BRANSON101

How did Dog the bounty hunter get a ticket to space?
merveilleux  !!!!!!!
Amazing what years of tax avoidance can get you.
What a great achievement! If they can figure out how to make this workable to get crew up to the ISS or into orbit, then the big contracts come rolling in.
he did look scared though
c'est excellent, félicitation j'adore même si c'est cours, ça reste une bonne expérience.
Офигенно !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Wonderful day! I happy that gave us these shots!
Were the passengers all wearing parachute rigs with AAD’s in them? Why?  Admittedly Unity would be the best Jumping Aircraft on the planet, but Why otherwise?
They experienced weightlessness because they started to fall down not because they reached space !! They did not even reach the low orbit of satellites 100 - 1200 miles altitude.  They reached 53 miles of altitude.  A person can experience weightlessness/zero gravity  in a zero - G , Vomit Comet: Training Flights for Astronauts!!
Sir Richard, please take a bunch of flat-earthers out there.
Any flat earthers watching? No, thought not. Doh!
And by “out of space” we mean: still inside earth’s low orbit.
This literally all started with Tubular bells.
On behalf of all taxpayers...thank you!
Glorified Zero G Flight ✈️
Amazing, congrats! But who or what was that knocking on the hull to get in?
Not really space though is it; let's be honest.
Congrats!
Did their ears 'pop'?
Thx Virgin Galactic ! We dream with you 😍
Space tourism is finally here.
this is nothing more than a carnival ride !!  LOL. SpaceX all the way !!!
That speech will be sampled in chill hop songs for generations to come 😊  Hope this becomes affordable by the time I retire!
While stocks drop 16% lol
So cool 😎
GO TEAM BRANSON!!!!
it looks like you need a bigger spacecraft to enjoy the weightlesness more😉
How is this different than the vomit comet? Cool for people with lots of money I guess...
Congratultions!
Not a spaceflight if you dont go to space 🤔
So unbelievable, the words of Richard branson before experiencing zero gravity, made a lump in my throat, without a doubt something that was only a dream, is becoming the reality, the entire humanity saw this. Congratulations from México
👍🚀
I found the quiet the most mesmerizing
imagine paying a quarter million bucks for the trip... only to find yourself knocked unconscious the entire outer space trip.
Amazing!!
Simulating Weightlessness   just like can on airbus  LOL
what was total time they spent in space?
Haha the earth is flat.... 😉
Great Experience
One day imma make that trip
it is nice to hear the what they say... that´s it!
OMG earth is Holly
Where's   the ladies room tho?? 😮 🙃😵🥴🥴🥴😂😂💜🌌🌌🌌🌌🌌🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Século 21: A autoexaltação esquecendo-se do Criador, que Criou e Cria tudo, nos Concede Livre Arbítrio e inteligência, e sem ELE Permitir, nada é realizado.  Que a nova geração desça do pedestal e exalte o Criador, O Real Rei da Glória, O D'us de Israel, que é o D'us Único de tudo, que por Misericórdia nos Permite tempo para nos voltarmos para ELE.  "O filho honra o pai, e o servo o seu senhor; se eu sou pai, onde está a minha honra? E, se eu sou senhor, onde está o meu temor? diz o SENHOR dos Exércitos"  Malaquias 1  Leiam a Bíblia.  Desfrutem a vida, mas reverenciem e agradeçam ao Criador.
Should’ve played some Carti in space it’s only right
I really appreciate you guys choose not to overlay music and have the true human emotions speak for themselves! What an incredible achievement! Every day we getting closer and closer to become one with the stars!!!!!
One step closer to launching all of the billionaires into the sun. 🤞🏼
LOL this AirPod….
Richard ROCKS!!! way to go! 🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻
That was awesome! Congrats!!
Outstanding!,!
The moon is 4,777 X further away than virgin galactic reached.  They had a terrible signal with terrible delay resulting in a nasty choppy feed.  1969 Nixon spoke to men on the moon from the whitehouse with milliseconds of delay. Why would VIRGIN GALACTIC owned by the SAME GUY THAT OWNS A TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANY  (Virgin Mobile)   Have not thought about having the absolute BEST COMMUNICATIONS FEED  From that great distance of 50 miles.  Seems that woulda been a HUGE DEAL
Simply unbelievable. Breathtaking at every angle. Thank you for clarifying that the earth isn't flat for those flat earthers but I'm sure they'll make a conspiracy about it but again incredible
ILU Lord Grand Duke Homie G. Richie Brandson, <3, wow, Coolest G, ILU Dude, Bye Dude
Looked like free-falling👀.....not floating,weightless. And what happened to extreme heat during re-entry?  Has our tech come so far we made it vanish into thin air? 😄🚀
Самый лучший полёт в бездну... с 49 долларов на 40 Улететь,лучше бы не было этого полёта,одно наедалово
Lucky bastards I wanna go tooo Richard!
How is it safe to be at a height where your blood would boil if the cabin depresurised and wearing pyjams ? Huge great windows yet a fully pressurised cabin . ????
250000 € for 2 min….
😂🤣 utter fake.
How would they handle someone who goes crazy and sneaks a knife on board to attack everyone in space to be the 1st? They need security of some kind. You are basically putting your life in the hands of strangers, and for what? No thanks. This is a huge waste of money and resources. How about feeding starving children first.
SINCE WHEN HAS SPACE BEEN AT  250.000 FEET ????       space" begins at 80.4km (50 miles), or 264,000 feet.
I remember first hearing about virgin galactic when I was 11 and now I’m 20 finally seeing the plans come to fruition. Absolutely breathtaking
Phenomenal!
There are so many salty people in the comments, let me explain for you're disabled soul: this is historical because it is a step towards civilian space travel. Also, billionaire doesn't equal BAD, for you're stupid-simple minds.
That vast emptiness outside the atmosphere is scary
Wau das braucht die Menschheit unbedingt..
Hearing the excitement in his voice makes me so happy.
Im team Elon, but this was cool.
The only thing “amazing” here is that they revealed the 50 mile range of their camera !    That’s amazing!  1969 president Nixon talks to Neil and buzz ( in real time) from the whitehouse to THE MOON over 240,000 miles away.  2021 virgin galactic has TRASH Signal  both video and Audio at a range of 50 miles.
Indian flag on her shoulders what a proud moment!
Congratulations! I see you all enjoy it!
TO GET PAST ALL THE SPACE JUNK      WOULD NEVER HAPPEN YOU BE SMASH TO LITTLE BITS
😎 🚀 🌌 🛸
No masks and how much fossil fuel burnt? Rules for thee but not for me
C'est n'importe quoi. Encore Space X a un but mais là il y a rien à part cramer du carburant pour des mecs riches.
LOOK HOW MUCH SPACE  JUNK IS AROUND  EARTH TELL ME HOW YOU PLAN GETTING PAST ALL THAT     ???
Пульс умер вместе с акциями Галины))))
When I  see the earth from space I can never tell what part of it I'm looking at. Can someone let me know? The big river in the desert for eg. Is that the Nile?
NOT EVEN SPACE  lol   NICE  FRAUD  :)   WE ARE TRAPPED BY SPACE  JUNK  KNOWN FACT
I think Mr Branson has to much  money to throw away why doesn't he spend the money down here on earth
Shut up. Spin and float around you dope!
Now fix it, don't leave it like that
I hope they do night launches. I'd want to see our galaxy's stars in all of their glory.
Inspiring!
Hats off to them, i'd be shitting my pants
I hope this is my apple I believed in them and bought stock early
Congratulations to virgin galactic team
To think it all started with selling sweets at school.
Indian flag 🇮🇳1:21 ♥️
Wow maravilloso espectacular no importa hayan sido minuto pero esa experiencia será maravillosa para cualquiera que le gusta y le  intriga saver que hay mas alla..
Up yours Bezos 🤣🤣🤣
2:15 😂😂😂 Open the door
Yes, anything is possible - cheques payable to Richard Branson. Don’t forget the C02 surcharge
They need to have a way to fold the seat
Take that you flat earthers! Earth is round! I cant wait for flat earther comments
Richard Branson grabbing at the window seal reminds me of the first space walk. There were no hand holds on the outside of the ship so the astronauts didn’t have much control. I bet they install some handholds or Velcro with gloves to help orient oneself to look out those windows.
So.       WAS IT ROUND???
One crazy man with a dream. Dream done
This is why he is ripping us off back at home in the UK I'm paying virgin media 600 GBP annual for 100mbps down and 10mbps up...just to float this old @*$% up near the edge of space.INSPIRATIONAL???? more like DELUSIONAL...
Best moment of his life
Just to put things into perspective... The upper edge of Earths atmosphere is 10,000km.  These guys went to an altitude of 88km.  Not even close to exiting the atmosphere, never mind space!
looks flat to me
One rule for the elites and another for us?
Imagine what I can do? Clearly you forgot what all that money can actually get you - meanwhile the 99.7%  population of the earth that are dirt poor compared to you will never get to experience anything like this. Myself included.
Hmm looks fake
Goosebumps while I was watching this video.
While people are dying of a lab engineered virus, some are looking to get away from earth. Maybe something worse is going to happen on earth and only a few elite are aware of it and are planning for it.
That ship is pretty cool and the interior looks surreal with all these windows to admire the planet. Love the design of it. Hope the prices will become more accessible to most as currently at USD 250K a pop it will only be for the very rich for some time.
when they can do it without piggybacking on another craft I will be impressed.
❤👍
*Акции збс вы слили. Мы все ахуели.*

2:34 aliens come into frame to say hi 👽
Super ! Top! 👍👍👍👍
Money cant buy happiness.......... 🤡🤡
Just please don't call them astronauts
What a great time to be alive
Absolutely fantastic just a shame it does not last closer to 10 minutes  So you can enjoy the view longer.
Bubbles in space
Looking for the  🌎 Isn’t round comments
Stunning footage! Thank you!
Congratulations, Virgin Galactic Team 😍😍
Hey what is your company stock problem. 18% decreasing? Are you kidding me?
Anybody wanna spend the entire day getting ready to visit the edge of our atmosphere for 5 mins? How much does it cost again?
Except all those kids will be dealing with the effects of climate change caused by rich pricks going up to space in rockets every day.
No flat earther will ever dare board this religion ruiner.
That’s pretty amazing
Poor pilots cant unstrap for safety reasons
seeing dream coming true is amazing..
What was that banging?
impressive. congrats richard and everyone involved directly or indirectly.
First Britt in space?
I wonder what all the people who think the earth is flat make of this lol..
floating for roughly a minute and a half? seems familiar somehow.. oh yeah plane maneuvers, nice only corner shots of the "earth"  gg guys. show me a full scene please.
It looks so fake so it has got to be real . . . right? lmao
Shame he ended up in history as a British traitor EU stooge.
Put starman by David bowie and the experience would be 100.000 better
They Most Beautiful Ive ever seen.. WAY TO GO;-))
When billionaires have so much money and power they have their own space programs, they probably shouldn't exist.
Lmfao what a joke. Cgi etc. the world is flat
branson you are like the real around the world in 80 days
Amazing
Dont let the kid in you DIE! The innocent smile and excitement on Branson's face proves that there is no age for the kid in you to surface...let it come and be natural
Rich f*cks
Absolutely incredible and so inspiring! Thank you Richard Branson for making your dream into a reality. What a gift to the world.
GOD’S UNIVERSE IS AWESOME!  🙏💒❤️
Highschool teacher: " Richard, You will do nothing with your life!" Richard: 🚀🚀
Congratulations to Richard Branson from Philip Bommer you made it possible to Traval to space!
Whats the price ? 200k dollar i swear big respect make those things possible
Yeah now hopefully then can see the damage earth has from us humans.
it definitely needs some handles, and i think it should have a bar in the middle with space foods/drinks.
Congratulations! A game changer. Richard Branson persevered.
Can you imagine? These people can now just get back to their normal life, and tell everyday people "oh yeah, I've been to space." And it will be for real. What a mindblowing period we are living in!
0:57 Vampire!
dream come true!!
Who cares about floating around in space. What I would love is to see the Earth and all its beauty like that in space.
it's so cool congratulations to all. it is worth it to work 17 years.
The look on their faces sais it all
Нахуй ты акции обрушил?
2:02 That shot is quite eerie, but amazing.
Tremenda experiencia, espero algún día poder ir también. Éxito 👍👍👍👍👍  wonderful experience, I hope one day to go.  Congratulations👍👍👍👍👍
Any one INDIAN 🇮🇳 here🙋‍♂️🥰😃
Seems to be not much more than an updated version of a "Vomit Comet."
54 miles up is not really space is it? its just a high altitude flight
Totally awesome!!! 👍😊
Congratulations, cool!
Buy Safemoon!!!!
Curvature with fish eye lens
"Looking down to our beautiful beautiful Earth" Richard Branson.
Funny how they're still in 95% of earths gravity, yet floating like zero g.  Even the ISS supposedly is in 90% of the earths gravity, and the reason they float is the centrifugal force of them "falling" around the earth.  In other words, they're in free fall for this.. not in "zero G" of space.. lol.  DITRH.
Where is curvature ? Where is the earth in all measure 🧐
This is insane.
Seems like a great time to serve a bowl of soup.
Bravo Branson best of the humans! Nothing is impossible!
Its unbeliveble man🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🙏🙏🙏🙏
Happy for you : ) and us all. The Earth must look amazing!
💯🕊️🎆🌌
Completely awesome
I was SO glad not to see china-made Tesla in this launch...
Well done Richard !!
Лучше бы Гагарин был американцем. Не так стыдно было бы мне сейчас.
why is my heart melting...
Happy days Sir Richard you are truly a multi generation inspiration. Congrats to you all 🙏🏼
Should have taken a flat earther with you Richard, could have ended this in one swoop.
And this all began with a record shop in London... My respect and admiration to Sir Richard Branson 🙏 🙌 👏 ❤
It will just be my luck and be sat next to a crying baby..
I am literally getting emotional seeing this.  This has lit a fire in me to achieve even more for myself.  I want to experience the same thing and more.  What an amazing time to be alive.  Congratulations Richard Branson and associates.
So the Virgin finally got its cherry popped  🍻 guys
His speech gave me chills! I hope the next generation can turn the world around for the better!
A full pilot view of a flight would be great
Please release the footage from inside during rocket part
Amazing. I would have loved to joined that flight. I'm guessing the 68 dislikes are from the Flat Earthers who have now been shown that the Earth is in fact a sphere.
I wonder if Virgin Galactic are going to use Metamaterials, Inc. technology for space travel in the future.
Again! Do it again!!
I suppose these guys didn't get the notice that space is not considered to start at 282,000 feet. It is infact considered to begin at 330,000 feet. So besides not reaching space even though they said they did, the one minute they spent in weightlessness based on the trajectory of the flight can easily (and has been many times) be achieved much more cheaply with a normal plane
Why no footage of how the earth looks taken from the camera outside the craft?
Now send these Flat earthers up next..im bout done tire of their none sense
Is this real or staged?. You never know these days with all the fakery.
Nice job.. Too bad no one with a normal income will get to fly in space anytime soon though.
Flat earthers are quivering…
Amazing !! Congrats !!!
Investing in crypto now should be in every wise individuals list, in some months time you'll be ecstatic with the decision you made today.
Investing in crypto now should be in every wise individuals list, in some months time you'll be ecstatic with the decision you made today.
Its easy to forget sometimes that these billionaires are real people who still aspire for better things in life just like the rest of us. It was touching to see Sir Richard Branson talking about being a child looking up to the stars with a dream. Congrats
1:21 proud moment for India 🇮🇳 saw Indian flag
Well those 20k in shares i bought are going to pay off Great move forward for space ether way This is seriously cool as hell
When adults became children.
2:17 for a fraction of a second I thought he was gonna open the window 😂🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
Love to see it but I wish he didn't murder his share holders by selling 500 million in stock
Can you guys do something about global warming instead?   Or feed people?
I wish there was the urge to end world hunger/poverty, than to make more money off people.
Maxed out BI in warthunder be like:
Didn't get to the level of Armstrong's speech, but it's alright tho, i am sure he wanted to top it
Ручки надо в салоне добавить. Дед чуть иллюминатор не вырвал.
здорово!
I believe if the money spent to build this shuttle was spent to end US poverty and social crisis we would be much happier that watching this video !
Amazing unbelievable...waiting for santhosh George kulangara travel time
Nothing is impossible if you're having Billions and Billions $🎉🌏💞
Flat ethers 🤣
For those saying its not space theodore von kárnan said 82km should be considered space and the karman line was created after his death and there's not much difference between 80km and 100km, it's space
Why do the pilots need oxygen masks but no one else does? Do they know something everyone else doesn’t? 😳
How dare that Branson call himself an Astronaut. outrageous hubris.
Don't seem much longer then going up in the regular NASA training plane.
this is the reality of human kind, it will invest billions into egoistic adventure to distance us from the earth & nature instead of investing into healing its wounds that we caused
I want to see the full interior video right after the rocket fires!
20 yrs billions of dollars and all you get is a glorified carnival ride.  whay a waste of rocketfuel
Chuck Yeager did that 70 years ago.
Congrats! Amazing step in suborbital flights. Happy to see it! Great work Richard and VG team!
Nice one! Why to waste the limited resources of our planet to do this kind of entertainment? I think the next generations (if there will be such) will look at this video and "thank" us for leaving them polluted and empty planet! It is just another pointless jet propelled oil burner! Next level of idiocracy is travelling to an empty planet called Mars. Sorry and thank you.
I will trust this guy and his team of people Moon Space Station
A billionaire at the edge of space, tearing up for his fulfilled dream! Wow! This has made it all better for everybody!
സന്തോഷ് ജോർജ്ജ് കുളങ്ങര സർ  എന്നാണു പോണേ we are waiting sir
ന്റെ മോനെ പൊളിച്ചു... Waiting SGK❤🔥
For a moment I though he would pull the window down.. ;/
Congratulations
Expression of genuine fear...2:49 😁
Why are billionaires allowed to throw more climate changes into the air just for their amusement??!
Where all the “flat-earthers” at?
That is so cool it looks like Buck Rogers
Impossible is nothing!
did you see captain tom
2:15 They almost went
No one needs that much money! Tax the billionaires so that the rest of us can survive!
What an achievement.. Wow! Kudos Sir Richard Branson and the entire team..
This is  technology progress very and really  cool
Looks great but the whole time i,d be thinking please get me to the ground. Please.
You did it again Sir Richard! Congrats.
Gratulations for this marvel. It may not be a big step but it let's all of us remember our dreams.
If ever you have a spare seat let me know... 😅 Big congratulations!
Question. Why do the pilots have masks and the crew don’t ?
Billionaires love messing with the plebs.   Study the occult and it will be much more clear what this is.
What an amazing job that the Virgin Galactic team has done!  Branson’s message must have already inspired some kids around the world after watching this flight!  A big shout out to the team again 🚀🚀🚀
Fisheye lenses
Amazing!!!! 🥲
THATS AWESOME!
A great message for the new Generation: ' IF WE CAN DO THIS; IMAGINE WHAT CAN YOU DO''.  You have open a new era of ADVENTUREZZZZZ
I love it
I don’t think they should broadcast video live from inside the spacecraft until after a successful landing. It’s still early in the program’s history and unexpected things could happen.
And the re-entry shield is ? Anyone.
Brilliant! All the flat earther’s….how you do’in?
First billionaire in space, wow 😘😘😊🥺
How many countries in one view ???
I wanted to see internal footage of them on ascent whilst the solid rocket was firing and also on reentry.
Congratulations!
Incredible. Well done humans.
awesome!
Falling like the vomit rockets. Not zero-G of true space. But you know that. Still a great achievement.
Can I reserve a seat for your next flight, please?
Flat earthers are quiet tonight…🤣
Great all the best
Am going to give a speech as my colleagues have fun
How did they re enter without heat shields or even heating up at all?
To achieve space  it cannot have a plane Attached to another plane for commercial travel, and if that's what Branson invisions then what a waste of money (obviously he's catoring towards a particular audience, while forfilling the dream he wants)but for such a vessel to achieve amazing feats it has to take of from base to orbit and return back down(with people on board) then it becomes a commercial milestone towards space.   But I do like that those pilots need to wear jet fighter helmets, as we all know who the true visionary is, and it's not bezos.
I don't get really get it. What's the point?
Flat earthers be like : Earth is flat -_-
All I can say this is the first step of human comercial space travel congratulations on the success of your dreams
Kudos to the Virgin Team 👏👏
the earth is officially flat
Congratulations !!! Saving money as we speak. Going to one day experience the same thing. You guys have made it possible for people like me to experience space at least once in their life time.
Can you believe cnn ran a hit piece on this just hours after they accomplished such an awesome feat ?
Incrível 🇧🇷
This world belongs to the people who are : 1. Ready to take risks 2. Ready to wait for that taken risk to rather fructify  Kudos to Sir Richard Branson!
The real credit goes to the pilotz
That's so cool
How far away can they fly with this thing?
Too bad only the older generations will get and comprehend new ones are too busy doing Tik tok
Can’t wait for some space ship airports !
LOL this is staged and fake AF, come on people.
Congratulations 🎉
Incredible! Positive news we needed! ❤
Take my money!!
Glory be to Allah the Creator Islam is the true religion
Branson's reaction says it all. Great job guys
Where are the flat earthers at?
sory this is not space...yes the earth is in space but space in 100km and you got 80km....soooooo NOT SPACE
Wow wow wow!!! Amazing achievement! For all the naysayers!! You’re such an inspiration, keep doing what your doing!! Congratulations to you and your incredible team!
I can see Virgin Galactic going to moon with this concept by via layover space hub to several transport vehicles for full moon 🌕 round trip.   This by far is the safest for humanity space travels !!  Elon: It look so real it looks fake.  Bezso:  Yeah it’ll be hard landing on our backs.  Some facts to compare:  short of  X-15 flight 91 flight apogee of 354,200 feet.  Piloted by Joe Walker became the first person to enter space twice. He had a maximum speed of 3,794 mph (6,106 km/h) and a maximum altitude of 354,200 feet.
Awesome stuff! Congrats to all who have made this happened. 👏👍
Astronaut 001 Richard Branson.
It is cheaper & accecible than 2 othere
It wouldve been great if he SRB said looks great looking down on a beautiful round earth.
Earth is not circle
How is THIS space? This is just an exaggerated version of the vomit comet. They just went up really high and then fell back really slowly. They're not weightless they're just falling.
wonderful stuff. Congratulations!
I wanna see food service on this thing.
I wonder what the flat earth people are saying now
Simply awesome!
Flat earth society: Fake fake fake
That's one way to get rid of wrinkles! 🧓🚀🇬🇧
I wonder if any flat earth people will buy a ticket and check it out themselves? 🤷🏿‍♂️🤷🏿‍♂️🤷🏿‍♂️
Wow sir. U r an icon. Star Trek The Next Generation. Thank you for inspiring
Looks like poo in his pants
Imagine the wry, droll smile on Elon Musk's face in a couple of years as he rides one of his many Starships into orbit.  One that has been especially outfitted for his own personal use as the first privately owned orbital space yacht.  I'm sure he'll be sipping champagne from the Spaceship Salon as he orbits Earth and in response to a reporter's question he'd be like, "Oh?  Bezo's and Branson?  Those guys are ADORABLE!!!"
The 21st century's challenge: solve climate change and inhabit multiple worlds.
хорошо конечно он цены слил)))))
Really inspiring and enjoyed watching the live feed. I feel however this must ensure scientific value and not just become a rollercoaster on a rich persons bucket list
I love the fact that this is happening in our generations 😌
Wish we saw their faces when they hit mach 3... Surprised they don't have oxygen masks cause that pressure is real.... Hmmmm
Now you know how Armstrong felt in the X-15 in '62...
but is the earth flat?
👍🏻🇮🇳🇮🇳
It's FLAT)))
Thinks Richard.    And all those shoulders were standing on to make this possible!
And now you can build the door on ship  to arrimage too ISS ? Iff one day ISS have SOS for exemple colisión with satélite you can go too save us in 2h00 and why not you can start on new mexico and arrive in europe in little time and return the same day ! With another mother plane in europe
Amazing
🤣🤣🤣🤣
this is amazing
Congratulations!
Looks like something out of a 60s sci fi movie…except it’s real.
Круто, у меня слёзы радости за такое достижение🥲
Bravo Virgin Galactic. Wow!
Imagen what you can do! Okay if you are born like me with no legs ore arms, can`t even see (just now my nurse is writhing)
Awesome!
How'd this thing land?
Would be great to have the footage from release till entry as this didn´t worked in the livestream....
Most expensive 0 G flight...
It's look like bacaniximos 😎😎😎
waiting for Santhosh George   .....
പൊളിച്ചു ട്ടോ
Wow unbelievable, so cool. Love to go with you next time.
Congratulations guys and gals , That was really cool !
this guy is a fiasco damm stock crashed because this old men did a offering now losing money never trusting in these old guys never !!
Congrats! Great flight!
Oww I was really hoping to see their faces when they drop and the rocket kicks in
You was not in Space.The Space beginning in 100 Kilometer height.😂😂🤣🤣.You are a funny Dreamer.
Private sector wins again!
All these comments must be from employees.... They didn't reach space and everyone's acting like the moon landing just happened...
A very sad moment for flat earthers as the curve is shown from space by non nasa source.
Que foda!!!!
where is mario from Porto ?
Imagine 100 years from now... Incredible. I wish i could live 250 years
someone to talk about karamn's line? not? ahha just kidding! AMAZING!!!!!
How about the $200M in tax payer money? Why didn't you pay for it all?
This is incredible and an amazing! But I don't believe you could be called an astronaut unless you orbit.. Just my opinion.. Congratulations nonetheless.
Ok ok this is amazing , fantastic big step forward but let's just look at the facts here they didn't actually go into space they didn't even reach low earth orbit.
I want to see the go pro footage when it launches of thier faces
He's not even in orbit he's only in the upper atmosphere lol
So full of sh$& nothing but Fake AF. Logical thinking will debunk, do I see water bubbles? Just like NASA FaKe AF
Success!
That's awesome!!!  So jealous!
Congratulations on making it to space.  I guess there will be a niche for 4 minute space flights.  I suspect orbital tourism won't be that far behind, and will close this niche.  Until then, this will be an exciting ride to buy.
From 1:38 -1:48 it seems they forgot to add the Earth's curvature to the horizon seen from the window for 10 seconds straight. Not to mention that a Blackbird aircraft flys at around 70-90000 ft and a full pressurized suit is needed. This flight wasn't even close to "space" and the lies are being shown directly to your face and people still believe in space flight.
I really want to see the inside view when the rocket engine turns on
Amazing!
They didn't even get into space... Not to mention there is no room to actually move around and enjoy yourself.... There is no abort system if something goes wrong... Just meh
This is so incredible. I don't even have enough money to pay my student loans, let alone buy a ticket for this 😭 but I have 70 shares in SPCE because they are truly amazing and I want to support this kind of science!
Super super cool :) Congratulations from Poland
Is there a up and down at that hight?
*A new Space era Just started!!* - _Now we all need just a million dollars to get there_ 😊🎉🎉
Who got Jeffrey Epstein's seat?
thats  awesome!!! really though, they should have hung out in zero g for at least 30 mins.... all that expense to have this experience and it seems so rushed once there... hangout ,chill and have some fun for God's sake!
I want to see their faces when the rocket starts. Awesome vid. 😁
is the back pack is parachute?
Any flat earther here. ..No. oooh I see it needs time to come up with theory.. but this time please don't come with cgi things...i expect something new..I know you guys are smart..
Now with advancements in technology we are entering a new era, the age of Billionaires in _SPACE_ !
1:41 - If I was Sirisha, I would get a wall size screenshot of this!!!😲 Amazing!!!  And completely jealous!
Here before 1M views
That was it...?!!!
Publicity Stunt; could have done the same thing in the "vomit comet". No science, no orbit, go up and then down. Yawn.
Fun fact: Sirisha bandla is only the fourth person of Indian descent to go to space. Rakesh sharma, Kalpana Chawla and Sunita Williams being the other three.
Nice!
Fantastic flight and beautiful birds!! ❤️❤️ Greetings from the Philippines!!
Congratulation to that great moment. You reach the space by using a very special technologie that works. Welcome among the astronauts.
Isn’t space for me If I don’t reach the orbit and do a lap around the globe 🌎 which it takes about 46 minutes then safe re-entry
India n girl 2nd time proud to 🤤💝💝💝
The media and branson really making suckers out you all. Do they leave earth's atmosphere? No. The weightlessness is present because of a short free fall. Which can be duplicated in much lower altitudes. All they are really doing is going really high.  This is all a marketing scheme.
This actually brought a tear to my eye!!! I have a feeling seeing Mother Earth from space would make me cry Incredible human achievement!! Watched it live on tv yesterday too. Wow. bonkers!!!  This is the start of a new era for humankind  🌎🌍🌏❤️❤️❤️🚀👩‍🚀🪐
I get this is personal but on one of the flights can we get a full video with no cuts. I want to see how everything changes, the acceleration, the time, the fall.
Why they didn't show re-entry into atmosphere?
Before the flight in promotion clip Richard Branson said that he will announce "something very exciting". What was that?
👍🏻
It’s flat
Направи ми оазис с мойте средства и аз ще дойда .Марс .
Im saddened by all the negative comments. Those people obviously have no hope. How truly sad.
The re-entering CGI would have blown the budget👀
What a load of shi❤️
Малый шаг для человечества и большой для кучьки милиардеров...
Please tell me why?
I lift my foot it’s in space
I love how the earth is concave at 1:45 because of the fish eye lens that you guys use to fake the curvature of the earth.
For the world, another milestone toward private commercial space flight. To "Flat Earthers", its just another example of Hollywood trying to manufacturing deception about a "round" earth. Full disclosure: I am *not* a "Flat Earther".
All the people that say the earth are having heart attacks
Why was Branson wearing a parachute?
Brilliant 🤩 Virgin Galactic shares will grow in value!
Dose any one get a kind of weird twinge when he talks about all the kids of earth?... like a huge portion of those kids will die from fairly trivial means that some extra money could help with. But nah, lets go to space for a half hour. 👍
I know this is obvious because there is no atmosphere in space but it so eerily quiet up there . Thank you Richard and team at Virgin Galactic for sharing this with the world!
Just freaking awesome. Congratulations all!
How did you chose the pilots for the journey? What an incredible opportunity!!
250k for 4min in space ? nope
Nice. Can I go next?
Amazing....suck this flat earth idiots!
The reality of space tourism is here… Thanks to all involved in making this happen!
Cannot stop watching this 🥰
empty space with a beautiful experience
Why can we not see the flight in an uncut version i really wanna see these people fly mach 3.1 XD this is a joke once again ! Dreamers !
richard making a speech.  Others: wohoooo, yippe ............making weird noises.
Space is much valuable then money 💰 for some....? Hence proof.
Хубаво, направи го но безопасността трябва да е над вложените средства!
I wanted to see what the re-entry was like.
Fantastic achievement. Well done.
Endless waste of resources!
Мне одному показались неестественными движения людей находящихся в невисомости. Похоже на студийную съëмку с плохо подготовленными актëрами...
where's all the flat earther at?
Very Cool 🚀🌍👍😎
The Earth is flat! Space agencies = criminals!
Pretty cool!
Wonder what that little stunt cost?  I know, I know, If you have to ask, you can't afford it.
Hi Team Galactic. I can't afford the space ride but is there chance to win a lucky ride with you guys.
Propaganda gravity deception! CGI deceptions!
Well done guys, well done everyone!!!
congratulations on being astronauts*
clowns in a clown car
i hope somebody got fired for failure to broadcast Sir Richard's message live on tv, those were very inspirational words.
I will be back in 2031!
After polluting the earth now its time for space
Just bravo
How many launches would it take to film a space movie staring Tom Cruise. If it's more than one, you weren't in space.
Am I the only one who thinks this is so underwhelming considering all the achievements man has made in space over the last 50+ years? I mean what has been achieved here really?
Many many congratulations Virgin Galactic team this will bring more and more opportunities in Space area...  Thank you so much.. I also have a dream to at least see earch from space.
Man these folks being played like the fiddle.
That is Super Cool!!! I see Space passenger cruise ships in our future. Never underestimate man's ability to achieve a dream.
I was delighted and HONORED to be able to have watched the flight from a Virgin hotel!!  They had it in the "Funny Library" Coffee Shop here in beautiful Dallas Texas at the incomparable Virgin Hotel in the Design District.
Wonderfull!
It sure as hell wasnt to the moon and back space. I can fly anove tbe skys and call it space. What a farce.
Trip is too short
Amazing!!!!!!!
What a waste!!! So much energy, for just a few minutes of fun!  We are all been brainwashed for overconsumption of energy for daily use... These few fellows just burned more they can consume over lifetime all together in energy sum!!! F..k Vergin, never will come close to you!
Indiakkari undallo crew membersil
Now everyone in there has got slightly more radiation.
Is this not marvelously AWESOME!!! Maybe we can, after all. maybe we can.
no stars ....did not show earth for the cam inside terrible dude all fake
awesome!!!
We fucking get it dude, you're unbelievably rich and can do whatever you want.  It still took you 17 years to make a shitty austin powers spaceship that only goes up for 2 minutes.  *slow clap*
?
I see he brought a couple of female payroll sales reps with him.
To the moon 🚀 Like if you are bullish on SPCE
👏 WOW!
give me two tickets
My question is who will be the first youtuber in space 🚀
I dont believe they actually went into space.   Upper atmosphere,  yes but far from space.  Their weightlessness was not due to no gravity.
Richard branson proved that money can buy anything.👍
Officially space start at 100km (62 miles) it's the von Kármán line and not 85km (53 miles). Close but not space next time make sure to reach space otherwise it's just a zero G flight
Congratulations to the small plane that's filming them...
Who cares?
The Karman line is still Virgo intacta......
It is amazing to see my country flag it is most beautiful thing happened since very long time. India let's go make the world a better place. 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳:-)
No vomit..?  Congrats
My dude spent billions to spend 2 minutes in the upper sky
A theatrical performance... The zero gravity is caused by a steep descent back to earth, not from approaching orbit. .  A very expensive roller coaster... P. T. Barnum with a super model crew.   I'll put my money on Musk...
Despite the long wait and setbacks they pulled it off! Congrats and also acknowledge Burt Rutan, engineer behind the ship.
Congratulations!
Terraplanism there u have
This was the day racism died and a new age dawned...
That was quick
Congrats Virgin! i hope to work with your company someday 😁
Would have KILLED to see their faces on the launch with the G forces squishing them back!! A golden opportunity missed!!!
Please provide closed captioning!
Experiencing microgravity (weightless) is only possible in space. No other way till now on surface of earth.
Space Tourism Spaceplanes and Spaceships for the win!!!
Now we get to wait and see how much better Jeff who and his flying penis do on their attempt
Donated $50 to Omaze Charities. Now I have a 1000 chances to win a ride on Virgin Galactic.  If I win I'll sure have lots of family and friends wanting that second seat.
And the horizon is flat.  Oops!
Ground control to Major Tom Commencing countdown engines on...
I’ve been on Disney world ride that lasted longer than this and only costed half
Beautiful!!! Such a great Milestone Congratulations Sir Richard Branson for bringing your dream to life
Ali ainda é a nossa casa 🏠 🌎
Why is there not any footage of the Pilot and Chief Pilot?
Not a proper space flight not even a proper launch this was assisted and stupid
I wonder how much will it cost in 10 years or 20 years? i now have hopes that maybe in my lifetime i will be able to experience that!!
First _civilian_ commercial flights to space. 👍 Congratulations! 😆
It was a slingshot into the upper atmosphere, followed by a few minutes of freefall back towards earth, giving the illusion of weightlessness. If you're happy to call that 'space travel' be my guest.
നന്നായി..... സന്തോഷ് അണ്ണനും വരും അല്ലോ..
Nice speech. Congrats
it makes me thinking of the "One milion dollar man" intro 🤔
That line was amazing!! Congrats whole virgin galactic team 👏👏👏
Sir Richard! Your dream come true. Congratulations
And so it begins
Glad to see they made it happen! Here’s to new inspiration to keep pushing forward! 🍻
We're pioneers.. We've barely begun.. And our greatest accomplishments cannot be behind us.. As our destiny lies above us..
Spectacular! Emotional! Triumphal! Congratulations!
I'd like to go there myself sometime in the future.
Congratulations Richard and all the team. This was an out of this world achievement and seeing the way you all became "kids" again was amazing. Bravo!
World first air launching spaceship. Congrats Team virgin
Congratulations. This is a great historical moment in this century.
Funny how people today celebrate something that was done almost 70yrs ago as cutting edge.  (X15).  Laughable. There’s no achievement here….
SPCE got hit hard on Monday.... what a shame. Congrats to the crew on doing something amazing.
I want to visit space, see our earth and feel zero gravity, before i die.
Amazing. Awesome
The Air Force have a Special Jet plane that goes to that altitude every day,no am not impressed 😁😂. Re-entry lol.
All dislikes  are from flat earthers
wow this is so amazing.
The highest commercially available freefall is now just a few dollars away.
amazing
Wow! Shed some tears, Amazing!
Congratulations!
This looks fake
they should let you make at least 1 lap around the planet
Congratulations!!!!!! Great job, great view. Best wishes to all of you. Cheers.....
How happy and amazed they all looked :)
I would have gone earlier, i wasn't born rich 🥲
Admiral Branson & Crew to Boldly Go Where No One Has Gone Before !!!!!!!!!!
Alien boss :hows the d grade beings progress Assistant:not much.. They are not even close 😂
OMG that is so cool. How much will it cost?
Amazing Sirisha Bandla.. Indian Girl 👌👌 Congrats to team Virgin Galactic
A day i never thought would come in my life time - truly amazing
Congratulations on your expensive tourist attraction. No doubt the 180K pricetag for a ticket will make space accesible for everyone! XD!!
Full flat earth. thanks for proof once again
Utterly amazing, just bums me out when they say it's for everyone, when it's only for the super rich.
thanks for drop down treasure papers. lol. today a lot of not very smart peoples loose a lot of money
I will definitely do it before I die
He just wanted to check if the earth is still flat.
This is great! Would love to experience this when the technology is available to the public and to be able to fly to the moon and back without feeling any G's.
Finely, YouTube recommend something cool 👍
Amazing.
Really well done. Super chuffed for Richard and the dream. Well done all those who have worked so hard to achieve the wonderful possibility of a revolutionary new form of transport.
I hope one day I get the chance to go to space too
So happy sir Branson did it before butt-hurt Bezos. Well done!
To feel weightless for that long and not have to go through serious training is truly remarkable, one day I'll buy me a ticket to space, one day
Nice images from the heliocentric priest class. High altitude flight is not space. Can't have a vacuum next to a pressurised system. We live on a flat plane.
Everyone trying desperately not to throw up...
Some of us go to Disneyland for fun. Others go into outerspace. It just costs a lot more.
Definitely a remarkable achievement. The deafening silence of space was a surprise too. Well done to all involved
I'd be looking out the window looking for those UAP's
Nice
An easy thumbs down.
This is historic because this flight represents the dawn of an era where space will be much more accessible to regular non-astronaut folk like me and you. Commercial space flight will only get cheaper and cheaper as time goes on. I believe that our ideas of what the future will be like the last 50 years, is starting to come into fruition now.
Meanwhile back on earth, billions live in poverty.
All that money. How many needy people on earth could it have helped. Instead billionaires can play for an hour. Im not impressed.
690million people in the World live in extreme poverty and this guy is flying his space ship toys about for fun.
This is so much more ideal for commercial because they only need to leave orbit, not the entirety of the earths gravity.... Virgin is gonna win the space race, mark my words
Congrats on having one hell of a carbon footprint
Ok, I'll wait while Xiaomi offers something like that but cheaper :)
Hi..i want doing this .too..! this trip ...to....space..!  when prise .under...50000..Euro....!
Great Job.
I can't believe people gave this a thumbs-down. What miserable, shriveled souls.
No face masks in Space -- I guess covid-19 is not transmissible in zero gravity
The Virgin comet of vomit…..
I wondered where the TV package money I was spending was going to. £79 on a service I don’t use but had to have just to get internet.
Amazing, merveilleux, mémorable ! Merci d'avoir cru en vos rêves ! Many thanks about this wonderful first spaceflight! Thanks to help everyone to believe in their kids' dreams.
БРЕНСОН, ВЕРНИ НАШИ БАБКИ!!!
Amazing!!
Поздравления из России! Из этой идеи можно сделать межконтинентальные суборбитальные перелеты?
Real Magic
2:17 getting a bit stuffy in here, better open this window.
I think we should all pitch in and get that flat earth guy Mark Sargent a seat on the next flight so he can STFU once and for all. LOL.
What was Branson doing at Epstien's Island?
Now who's a Virgin! 🤪
Congratulations Virgin and Sir Branson.   ❤
Poor guy ! It is an ultra-rich pleasure for 10 'of weightlessness and the privilege of seeing the Earth from above. Bronson like Bezos and the few thousand people willing to put out $ 250,000 for a thrill ride with untold amount of energy really have time to waste. These same people must then make their conscience clear by doing their little selective sorting and rolling in Tesla at $ 60,000. It must be said that it is surely so much better than going on a thrill ride at Disneyland with the working classes ... As for the awakening of the colonization of space and other planets, it's just powder in the eyes of journalists and fools.
So cool
Aaannnddd..... Is it really round?
Truly astounding.
This is unbelievable, congratulations!!!!
For that kind of money I'd like to stay in space a little while longer
Spent millions of dollars to fly to space for 5 seconds while some people down on earth can’t even find clean water to drink, congrats.
I wanted to see their faces during the release and ignition.
What a waste of money.....try using your cash to better things here not in space......these guys have so much money they haven't a clue what to do with it...... they're bored to tears.....
Congrats to Virgin Galactic Team.
I don’t get it.  We’ve had the ISS on orbit for over 20 years.   We walked on the moon.  We control a rover on the Red Planet.  This was  2 minute, suborbital joyride?  Where’s the innovation, the achievement?
Any flat earthers in the house LOL?
Can’t wait for Elon to up one one on virgin 😂
Space tourism has begun!
SPACE CRACK all the way baby !!!
Congratulations! I wish you'd show the full flight from inside from launch to landing.  That would be extra cool!
Did they get to space?
Happy day to you!
Awesome, any video of their faces when the rockets  ignited, Sir Branson’s hands looked to be shaking.
Congratulations!! Wham Baam you-went-to-space-man!
Its just a glorified PLAIN that goes fast haha 💩💩
Probably took the time to line up another lawsuit against the nhs
this doesn't stop the flat from being earth
nice. but they definitely need more handles inside
Why so they have to say release 3 times?? xd
Amazing sir congratulation you and your team 👍👍👍
Amazing journey
👏  WOW AMAZING
Wish you a bright future ahead.
Any inside video of the drop and burn?
This is what your live stream should have been instead of the trash that it was.  Listening to flight control would have been a much nicer experience than that presenter/talk show host combination.    And why has not a single person credited Burt Rutan?  Didn't he found the company and idea before Virgin invested after winning x-prize?
I believe you can get a ticket on the vomit comet for about £5k to £10k to experience weightlessness - big difference.. want to see the curve of the earth, Russia still do their mig trips to the edge where you can see the curve of the earth... Rich man with a big ego and self interest... Now he will get bored and sell it on, oh not that he actually owns it, the shareholders do..
superr
I like turtles
WOW! What a tremendous accomplishment! Hope this becomes mainstream one day to where its not only for the mega-rich!
Look, they’re using AirPods Pro
I'm honestly excited to see what the flat earthers come up with to explain this one.
This is a huge accomplishment for Civilian Space Flights.  First step to normalizing Space Flights for Regular Civilians. Before if you weren't in Air Force or some extremely Special Scientist by 20yrs old you weren't on your way to being an Astronaut and today we have a team of Civilians floating around above Earth.  Our Grandchildrens futures looks so wonderful Jules Verne would be amazed.
Chief Executive Officer Virgin Galactic Astronaut 001 - Sir Richard Branson, I watched Your Historical First Spaceflight live together with the Entire Virgin Galactic Team from the comfort of my home and I loved every second of the most professional space broadcast that I have ever seen in my life! You Sir are the first, most awesome and humble Space Billionaire Grandfather on this planet and you are definitively a massive inspiration to all humanity on this planet! Your childhood dreams have become a space reality and the world is a better place because of people like you and I am sure that Eve would agree with me!
Respect to Branson and all those fantastic people behind this engineering marvel🇬🇧🙏
When rich people have so much money they burn it
So they put two females, one white, other black... For what? For WOKE purposes? Give me a break.
Finally 21st century looks like 21st century!
Beautiful
Pura Vida 🇨🇷🇺🇸👍🏼 WE CAN
Spirit of Sir Richard Branson ! I like it .
If I were a rich man... dabudibidibi...
Why did Richard Branson sounded like Arnold Schwarzenegger? 😅
I small step for Sir Branson a big step for Mankind!  Wow really beautiful view!
would be nice to see them inside while the engine in firing
I hate to burst his bubble but this minor entry into space was accomplished in the sixties by Yuri Gagarin and then Alan Sheppard when they both flew into the stratosphere and circled the earth.And their missions were a lot more dangerous.This was just a rich guy playing with one of his toys.
Joy.
Imagine being there having a panick attack  oh noooo :(
Now, protect ALL HIS DATA FROM AIRCRAFT DESIGN TO ALL OTHER, CHINA & RUSSIA WILL HACK AND STEAL IT.!!!
As a free thinker "What where the water droplets which kept falling from the craft constantly while in space?
Richard, what a star, ever since those steamy days down Portobello Rd I knew your sights were high; now look, you made it higher than most rocking hippies.  You're a genius.
Just imagine accidentally hitting RB in the groin flying around during this moment
Where are the flat earthers at?
This is proof, the earth is flat
delighted to my country flag 1.21 sec
Hoooray im floating  welcome to space i think u like space because its quiet and you can here yourself think if you can do that i can mow my lawn and enjoy life here on earth omg its space big deal
Where my flat earthers at? One of you must be offended by the doctored up video
I just feel that richard is shaking with an overwhelming sense of happiness.. Really happy for him!!! Just few months ago, when the stock insider sells their share everybody says badly about virgin galactic. What a comeback!!!!
Branson, a poor mans Armstrong
Плоскоземельщики вышли из чата.
Awesome! Thanks for sharing!
How much is the flight?
Like being on the Lolita Express with Epstein right Branson?
I dont get it really whats the big deal work on stuff for people here on earth space is not for man
THATS SO COOL 😹
Is there a re entry video pls??
Great job now will you buy me a house to live in?
i wouldnt have wasted any time holding a speech like that
Was Nickelodeon involved in this sci fi garbage! For all the kids! Get them when they are young, moulding the next generation of cattle!
So no masks?
They should prank richard, will be so funny
Wonderful!
Flat earthers: oh wow the earth doesn't look flat from those windows...fake video
Amazing!!!
More hand holds
Way to go!,, I would like to see everyone when to rocket lights and during the burn if there is video of it.
True Adventurerer and glad he made it before Bezos, sorry...
spectacular amazing mind-blowing ❤️❤️❤️😍😍😍😍
Santosh George 😀
Fucking stock
Lolita Express 2.0
Enough, please return to your seat 😆
Absolutely breathtaking!
So cool. I love the look of the interor. Looks so cool and inspiring to see it in space.
Pretty sure that’s not run on “Green” energy.
I think i'm the only one who questions the crew acting like crazy little kids with their mouths gaped open, and the fact the freefall effect can product exactly what they are doing in the cabin.
The sheeple will say that this is real
So cool !!  Why is it such a short trip I wonder?
Awesome! Incredible what people can achieve! Congratulations to Sir Richard and everyone at Virgin Galactic!
Hats off to the entire Virgin Team. Kudos
Почему про слив акций ни кто не пишет?
I thought this wasn't untill the world Cup they said
A great achievement. Well done!
this might kill the flat earth conspiracy
Can you take me with your next trip ? 😍
Someone borrow me 20 million...
Leaving a comment on a historical event's vedio
If you were in space you wouldn’t be constantly going up in the vehicle. Your in a plane doing a free dive to simulate weightlessness. I swear you all think EVERYONE is dumb.
Was anyone really that interested in this? I think that the money would have been better spent on getting covid vaccines to countries that really need help
Richard Bronson has done it
The ability to go to space will only become easier and easier now for us all (people with big bank accounts to the front of the line...for now)
My hands would be shaking too. 😁
being a spaceship pilot is one of the coolest jobs there is
even if i could afford it, i could not justify the waste of money for 4minets , but well done Richard and bert
Flat earthers take that!
激情三分钟，账单三百万
Finally space loses its virginity by Virgin Galactic 😂😀😂😂😂😂😀
Wish it was Bill Gates with one way ticket
Yuri Gagarin yauhns
FAKE :)
Wonderful moment. Congratulations  Mr.Richard branson & virgin galactic team. We are waiting for the departure of traveler Mr. Santhosh George from India.👍
I can't help but cry to see those happy faces who are overwhelmed by what is happening to them. The future can be great if we are able to handle it.
does anyone know where the petition to not allow jeff bezos not re enter earth is, amazon stole my money
While everyone was busy watching England at the Euro's, this event took place. A giant step for humanity and commercial space travel.
hmmmm there seems to be a curve.
Congratulations to virgin galactic team. Indeed a dream come true not only for Branson but humanity as a whole.
It's my dream to live in a world where people are kind to each other, look after the planet and all living things on it.  Was his dream more realistic than mine, or is it always about how much money you have?
The Earth is Flat. You can clearly see it with your own eyes @ 1:47
TY for 500mln spo
Congrats 👏 Looking forward to the future 🌎 I hope this new Generation listens carefully and changes....
0:47 "You are now free to move about the cabin" Awesome moment in space flight!
Beautiful. Well done to everyone involved.
Big Bravo! For the space plane designers and engineers, it looks  quite  interesting.
Congratulations! I mean what could go wrong?
Breathtaking...WOW!...Congratulations!
Where is the re-entry video?
Poor Richard he nearly lost his teeth!
Virgin Galactic, the chicken bus of space travel. If Easy Jet went to space it would be Virgin Galactic, charge you extra for the luggage. 🤣🤣
путін ВСРАВСЯ
He did not go into outer space. He did not go past the ozone layer. So technically he is not in space. Is quit lying about being in space. Space has a vacuum You never reached that point
congrats! looks like a wild ride. onwards and upwards! for want of a little more fuel and a lighter craft they could go a bit higher...just a little closer to the void
Wow. Awesome!
Prometheus
Amazing!!! Inspiring! Congrats!!!
How the this spacecraft enter into Earth's atmosphere without burning up?
Well done.
Richard and Beth on a space adventure. Where's Morty??
I believe comming 10-20  years it will be like as normal as  taking a flight. In 50's -60's  getting to plane was lke now a days space but now plane became normal. In future space will also be normal
Sin palabras 😱
How much?
I wonder how much the pilots are on?
Increíble llegar a esa distancia!!! esta justificado a nivel de competencia de quien llega primero y mas arriba. Pero propiamente no llego al espacio le faltó 20 Km para llegar a la linea de Karman. Solo llegó a la mesosfera (mesopausa 80Km) de acuerdo a la literatura.😉👍🏼
Great! Congratulations.
Amazing. Don't ever let anyone tell you something is impossible, because it's not.
In my opinion this flight didn't brought anything new for humanity but only showed how bored rich people spend their money on unnecessary things. 220k for 3mins experience of low gravity that's crazy as you can experience same for less using parabolic flight on the plane. What exactly was achieved? It didn't go even to space just merely reach the edge of the thermosphere.
Incredible times to be alive! I wish my Grandmother was still here to talk with her about this one. Truly amazing.
All that for a free fall?
He never been to space this is all fake 💯
Congrats! This is amazing, but don't slow down!
That looks amazing!!
$$$$$
Congrats 🍾🥂
That is Nuts! Congrats 🍾🎈🎉🎊
The X-1 release and firing on "The Right Stuff" was more impressive...and less wordy.
Look......at that round Earth.
I thought jet engines can't work or ignite in the vacuum of space,?
Beautiful footage !
“Space”
He went up to space and come back to land in just 1 hour....  Incredible
화이팅!!^^
Come on Virgin Galactic, 85km it's not "space". And 4 minutes of free fall is not 0 gravity, it's just fooling yourself.
As a flat earther I'm very impressed they managed to CGI the curve of the earth in one day. Props to their special effects team!
Is it me or did the sky or space seem starless?
It would be great for once to get from all separate cameras start to finish.
Congratulations from your earthbound friends!!! What an amazing achievement!
Short but sweet for certain
198 flat earthers complaining about fish eye camera lens, and sound stages in hollywood.
just superb feat indeed.
Amazing pictures, congratulations on being the first, I hope one day to be up there, when and if I can afford it 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Who said money can't buy happiness..!?
Накуканил дед с SPO
Amazing.
It's amazing to watch!
At this moment 170 terraplanists
5-3-2-1 YOU  ARE FIRED! She had one job to countdown  from 5 to 1. She did compensate  though  on Release - Release -  Release  maybe Richard  won't  release  her then.
Bravo!!!!
So, from their time lapse counter, I note they get aprox 90 second from command to unstrap till command to strap back into their seats. 90 seconds.  I'll be curious to see how much unstrapp time the New Shepherd passengers get.  Regardless, this looks like one hell of a ride.
Fake CGI.Branson.give my best to NASA. Your all fools those who comment.
Brilliant!!!
🚀👩‍🚀👨‍🚀🥰
I helped pay for that. Virgin customer.
🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢
That will the flat earther not like at all. Well, everything is fake for them anyway. Except for their theory, of course.
No helmet's or air supply ? Do they need them ?
So amazing….
And thus, like a candle in the wind the flat-earth movement was blown away from the face of the globe...
incredible! very cool!!!
I just hope some day a middle class man or woman can enjoy the ride as well
BRACE YOURSELVES... THE FLAT EARTH COMMENTS ARE COMING..... 🤣🤣🤣
It's really a unique space tour. Appreciated.   🎉👏👍👌🌌🚀
Эх , было бы у меня 250к зелени , я бы однозначно купил себе билет туда
0:54 "Welcome to Space" is wrong as they were not at all in space. Space starts at 100 km altitude, not 80 km (50 mi) because 100 km is the Karan's line, where the speed needed to maintain lift is the same speed (or velocity) to put a satellite in orbit. But great job for space tourism!
It was 117 in canada a week ago...
Well done Sir Richard Branson.  Great effort.
is that an extra 300 chase plane??
first person to build a rocket with his own money and go to space.!!!!
How did they make the earth look like a sphere?
Cringe
Very impressive folks but I think you didn't go far out into space where Bezos plans to go!!
So awesome
Рагозин, тащи батут!!!!
You're not astronauts, that's a legit profession. You're space tourists.
53 miles up. .... Not too shabby. 😊
Congratulations Sir Branson!  It is wonderful that you had the opportunity to enjoy space in your own space ship 🚀
The Future IS Now !
Amazing. It’s one thing I’ve never wanted to do or experience- space ship capsules are cramped and small - that is until now. Wow this looks phenomenal  Well done all
Congratulations! What a ride!
It’s a nice trip but nice view but. To just go up turn around after a while return to earth at least circle the earth for a day
And now it's time to Virgin Galactic' sales and marketing team promote and sell service for 0 G experience for Rich people only :')
Absolutely insane. A look into the future. Congrats to the teams and Branson!
2 mins plus in space. Cool
Dislikes, the very small group of "Flat Earthers" 🤣🤣🤣
Millions of dollars and a huge amount of valuable ressources just to send some super-rich dudes into space.  Insane !
I like how they cut the part where grandpa is upsidedown struggling to get in seat
Really science breakthrough.... Hope all flight will be same safe as this one
Congrats virgin galactic 👍
Millions, billions, trillions.   Space travel.   Millions, billions, trillions.  ‘Pandemic’  While populations in Africa do not have clean tuning water.  So much for ‘humanity’
Okay, this looks exciting! I’d want to stay up for a few more minutes though. Just a few.
One of the things that impresses me most about StarShipTwo is that it's pretty much all analog. I would've expected at least some fly-by-wire tech, maybe even computer controlled ascent, but no, it's just a couple of real humans, using their own strength and skills to yeet that thing 80+ km into the atmosphere. Gotta say, pretty dang cool
Incredible! How much for a seat?
SpaceFlight...How Beautiful! Would love to see this beauty fly up and dock at a space station to vacation in.
Sir Richard Branson, congratulations to you from India. 🎉👏🌌🚀
ты зачем обманул всех, ты видел цену за акции
Под хорошую новость товарищ Беренсон решил продать акций на 500 млн. Но это не плохо, ведь бабки нужны чтобы карета не загнулась завтра) и в октябре приняла первых пассажиров
Someone puts no time for caution music to this footage and we have a new meme
Congrats
would he b kind enough to spend that much to get rid of all the plastic waste his cassette business created from the planet???? Show off Instead
Where are the Flat Earthers at lmao
nuls de chez nuls 5 mns dans l air
Today india get her 2 woman to go space
Next generation's goal, one whole orbit around earth then go back. 😁
Wow
Who seen that air bubble at 135 bottom right
Who cares about this little rich boys escapades ?
💙
Congratulations the team and Sir Richard Branson for this historic day.
Flat earthers be like nah these people are actors and this is fake
Amazing I’ve always respected this man!
Richard Branson... The first human / lion hybrid to be effed off in to space.
How much was the altitude?
Shite
Gotta admit that those sounds of expansion of the pressure vessel are pretty unsettling !!! Even if that is not what is causing those metallic clinking sounds...I still find that to be very distracting from the experience and would put me very ill at ease with the whole thing !
Unbelievable.  Congratulations to everyone and those before them.  (Those that did not have footage to capture the moment but truly lived it.)
This is spectacular truly spectacular
Glorified carnival ride. No utility in LEO
So the pilots had full headgear on but the passengers nothing??
Wow the rich asshole is having fun with his new toy. Welcome to the 1%
New Era!
I want to go so badly! ☹️
Pretty short time up there
아ㅡㅡ오늘유증을 꼭발표했어야만했나!
Luxury space culture officially started.  Richard Branson ❤
💥💥👍👍👍👍💥👍🍺🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟👍👍💥💥
*and stocks go down, like wtf????*
Why they can't stay in the space for like 30 minutes or longer?
just a really expensive amusement ride
They didn't want us to see how scary re entry was because they want us to feel like it's some super safe easy thing to get to space and back
1:10 We feel the same Richard. You did it. Thank you, for paving the way. ✌️🌿
Obviously fake. Earth doesn't curve.
Thanks VGfor diluting the shares...
Jeff who?
where are the stars
Overall great flight to the edge of space.
Dislikes comes from flat earthers
Congrats but you royally screwed the shareholders today ..
Please release the full video from the interior cameras from release to wheel stop.
its sooo quiet
The biggest joyride around!  For all those who like the sense of falling for 2 minutes, whilst spending 250,000 dollars, then this is for you!
Im really wondering how the recruitment for these ppl went, as these are some weird folks xD
Excuse me, what's on her leg?
Just so much goose bump … awesome ..
Juding by the way Sir Richard was trying to hold on to the windows, the "halo edges" were not intuitive enough, an idea for the next one or retrofitting would be making the "halo edge windows" double edged, meaning "grab ring" booth on the inside and the outside of the window edge.
cool congratulations
That’s all we need in space is a seat belt and no suit?
Congratulations to Sir Richard Branson. He did it !!!  I mean about whole idea, company, team. Bravo bravo !!
2:16 Perhaps don't pull too hard at the window seal there Sir Richard!
LIES.
That's absolutely freaking fantastic! 😄
I wonder if the food sucks?
🎊🎊🎊🎊❤️🎂🎂👏👏👍👍
That must have been the greatest feeling, to have that dream of space flight, and work till you arrive in your own space craft.
Why couldn't they like chill out there for atleast an hr or so
You blumin well did it Richard.
You go up to 80000 feet, max. Stop the lies. Youre not orbiting anything.
Freaks me out a bit when he starts pulling on the rubber window seals so he could look out at the view!
What a time to be alive
Branson: The New Spielberg Musk: The New Lucas These guys are showing everyone how it's done.  They reached for the stars and started pulling them down
...and in Germany we pay new tax because of co2
American citizens, how does it feel to pay for all this!
Best video on the 2021
Is it a fish eye lense camera?
Why isn’t there a requirement to wear pressure suits and helmets at this altitude.  Even the pilots at least have oxygen masks.  I know they need to be alert at all times but what if a passenger has issues on this short trip.
I like this billionaire
This is the future right here.
That's how fantastic 4 was born.
What no drink service?  Must have gotten the econo ticket.
thank you for beating Bezos...

My congratulations to pickle billionaire Richard Branston, an outstanding achievement!
I love the fact that he took the time to give his speech before he unfastened himself and enjoyed his dream… What a man…
And the stocks are falling down 🥲
Now!!!! flat-Erathers pls take a visit, and pls b enlightened!!!!!
Glad I was around to witness this. Well done.
This is so f**king rad, well done all!!!!
I wish this would orbit the earth as well. Maybe the next version will do it
As fake as FAKE-X ... LOL.
I love you, Sir. Can't wait for the next move. Apparently, the earth is not flat... hahaha. Thanks a lot to all of you. I'm amazed. Just WOW!!!
This is huge and trully amazing, so much detail in everything, makes it look commercial ready. actually it is ready.
This is a propaganda video The earth is flat!!! 😂
As a kid who often wondered about space travel to an adult actually seeing it done, this is awesome.
Yo "flat earthers". Pay attention.
Fake, we all know the world is flat. Nice CGI work atleast.
if I had 2 questions it would be: Are they wearing parachutes? And what's the white thing on Sirisha's leg?
I want to see their faces while the engine is on!
*This is just like that lavish Indian Wedding shelling out loads of money for that 4 to 5 mins. of making out!* 🤷🏻‍♂️
Why is the stock dropping?
This remind me of the six million dollar man 🙈
ഞങ്ങടെ സന്തോഷ്‌ ചേട്ടനെ എന്നാണ് കൊണ്ട് പോകുന്നത് ബ്രാൻസൻ അണ്ണാ?
It would have been nice to see SPCE stock go up to space this morning.
Fantastic mate! Cheers on ya. What a dream to be weightless and fly. The dream of flying realized.
That looks like so much fun
Amazing Congratulations 👏
Lots of money for a few minutes up there ☺️
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍⚡🚀
The most entitled people on earth getting more experiences we never will......wonderful ...not
We are living through a global pandemic that has taken the lives of more than 4 million. Meanwhile, the first piloted commercial flight in to space is deemed a success. This world truly operates in strange and often inexplicable ways.
I would never of imagined this 30 years ago!
Я, конечно, очень рад. Но вот мой портфель не очень
Flat earthers 😂😂
But, the earth is still flat - according to flat earth idiots !
They should show this in schools, inspire a new generation!
The world's most expensive fairground ride pointless
Congratulations, you're the best !!!
Thanks for this
You need to install more handles on the wall, so you have something to grab on too, instead of the window. Or maybe use some Velcro
What an epic video. Just goes to show what a person can achieve in there lifetime
As no Oxygen nor pressure suits were worn, would the crew only be able to use the parachutes below 4200 meters ? Moreover having to egress through the oval-shaped hatch ? Or would the craft break up during an emergency allowing easier egress ?
Cool! But if it's for the zero G experience I would rather prefer a way cheaper ticket on a Zero G plane. The moments of zero g are shorter, but you have multiple ones. So added up you'll have the same amount of time or more of weightlesness than Virgin Galactic. At the same time the space you have to move around is very limited compared to parabolic flights with a prepared airliner.  By the way if 80km altitude is actually space, depends on what definition you adhere. It would have been better if they would cross the Karman line at 100km. But if it's for getting at least a near real spaceflight experience on a 'budget', this is really cool. So would I buy a ticket if I could afford it? I don't know. Maybe if I was a millionaire. But if I was a millionaire I would do my best to become a billionaire and buy a ticket at SpaceX.
Well, they only made the NASA 50 Miles definition of space. For the rest of the world it was just a pretty high flight
he went to lower orbit not to space ....
Congrats Virgin Galactic
You lucky devil !
Abre la ventana y respira.
Congrats
this is awesome !
Super Super Super Super Super
Beautiful!
Я так рад за вас всех !!!!
สุดยอย
As he is talking and they are fucking around...they hit the "Eject" hatch door open....
Next stop....to the Moon !
I feel truly sorry for the people who downloaded this.
I hope this will b affordable in my time ..im 31 ....
Wow
That he would do this is amazing! And bonkers! But amazing!
Take off the glasses
It's been done before. The X-15 went higher and faster in the 1960s. Branson is just cornering the market for mega rich thrillseekers.
Please give us a full lenght inerior Video.
An incredible experience! The development of the system took a very long time. Many people lost hope of starting operation and began to be skeptical about the project. And me too. But this flight proves that the system is practically brought to working order. The start of regular tourist flights will bring people and mankind closer to space.  Congratulations Sir Richard and thank you and the whole team for your persistence. You make the future closer and better.
Father of Space Tourism, Richard Branson giving birth to a whole new experience :)
LOL they're acting like a kid rather than an adult but lots of love of Mr Branson ❤️ you deserve our respect 🙏🏻
Congratulations Richard Branson and group Virgin Galactic!
Earth is not flat and actually round.
2:15 - It's hot in here, how do I open this window?
Notice they didn't show inside footage of the crew when they went mach 3 or when they re-entered.
This is fake the earth isn’t flat in the video
1:15 Earth is flat
Virgin is a great brand name...as they are still virgins to spaceflight
How did they re-enter with out massive amounts of friction heat?
That initial burn had to be pure fun!
Proof that earth is flat!
In the words of Neil degrasse Tyson, “boldly going where hundreds have gone before”… unimpressive expensive roller coaster.( my words)
You da Man, Richard!
Земля плоская?
Are those rubber gaskets around the windows Hand Holds?
He did not technically go into space as they only went up 53 miles.  62 miles up, the Kármán line, is the internationally recognized height of where space begins.   Better luck next time as Bezos will beat you to space in a few days.
Hey, flat-earthers - this is fake too right?
so awesome... =_)
Bruh idk why but this made me tear up. Future is bright
опа, а горизонт то плоский ,а не выпуклый
Stellar!! Ad astra!!! 🚀🚀
Дед красавчик !!!
What you really did is pollute the planet a little bit more and did nothing to help anybody starving
Congrats to the Scientist, Engineers, .....all involved. BRANSON just the dream, and money..they all brought it to fruition.
show for capital increase
Truly inspirational and incredibly exciting, the childlike like wonder this imparted on us all is just... It's something that makes people want to dream again.
Great! Now we can pollute the entire galaxy. Way to go.
In the next 50 to 100 years, you'll be able to buy one from Toyota...in the colour of your choice.  The sport rims and Wifi will cost extra tho.  Get the Roadside Assistance.
Martin Luther King Jr had a much better dream
Please don't come back to Earth.
Santosh Gerorge Kulangara fans come on !
Congratulations to everyone involved. What an adventure.
Flat horizon inside a zero gravity rollercoaster???
Cool but ... a tad anticlimactic.  Get a cinematographer up there 👆
Why launch from a plane? Gas consumption?
"If we can do this, just imagine what you can do" Mate I can barely put a pizza in the oven without burning it
These few minutes will be cited as proud moments for Virgin Group in human history. Truly inspiring..
17 years for 3 minutes of zero g.
what happened to van allen belt?...sir Richard
When you looked out of the window at the Earth....  Was it flat? :-P
Wow!!!
Ха ха ха😂😛😀.
This flight had to seek and obtain FAA approval.   Since the FAA still mandates the wearing of masks, this flight is in violation.   Having just flown and heard this very firm rule over and over, Virgin should be grounded and investigated according to FAA BS
Congrats on wasting 20 years.  Now a half dozen people at a time can get to the 50 mile mark that the U.S. designates as space, not the 62 mile mark the international community designates as space, and you're not even remotely close to actual low-earth orbit. I complete and utter waste of time with no rational applications for mankind at all save for less than 5 min of a nice view.  Really kinda pathetic.
Congratulations to the whole team from India 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
wooioohhhoooooooo!!
It's only space to the Americans. 96% of the world consider space as being above the Karman Line.  This was a MASSIVE anti-climax.
congratulations and thanks for dreaming. you inspire us, other dreamers, to keep the faith in our dreams too. this was EPIC!  :) <3
Amazing job!!!  I remember watching the 1st flight of spaceship 1 live. This is a huge accomplishment! So proud of the team!
Congrats! Great achievement.
Honestly, SpaceX has spoiled me - pretty cool, but not super impressed
Did the craft require heat shielding to renter the atmosphere? If not, it's just a high airplane ride.
yeah he beat Jeff Who
amazing moment in history
Using the comparison from child to adult is a little bit of a stretch, what's the word for geezer? Yes, so if you have a dream as a child, make a company dedicated to giving less worth than it takes, you might well be able to swindle youre way into heaven.
i will say it.. it was poor to joke like... who wants to pay to go upside down for 20 seconds ????? the british tax payer should be fuming after he got a bail out then did this
flat earthers are having another crisis...
Was für Bonzen-Arschlöcher!!  Einfach unglaublich diese Reichen und Mächtigen dieser Welt. Setzt mal die Knete für etwas sinnvolles ein.  I'm sure this will inspires kids to get into science and aerospace! Nooooo !! Sie sind hungrig sie haben nichts zu fressen und werden von Söldnern erschossen.  Leute wacht auf !!  So Dampfkessel wieder runter :-)
For me, saving the earth enviroment & sustainability is the great achievement of individual..just image how many carbon do you release during the ejection? Are blind to impressed these people..👎👎👎
Branson, где наши деньги!?)
Why were they wearing parachutes?
I see flat earth🙂
Amazing amazing. Congratulations
Кто то замки в геленжике строит, ктото космические корабли
incrível demais
Congratulations to Virgin Galactic team. Great achievement!!!
Space tourism is not far......👍
Branson is cheater.
Wonderful achievement for Virgin Galactic, Richard B and all future travellers to space 👍👍👍
Congrats ! But i cant believe Richard did not remove his glasses to look at the earth for this memorable moment ! i would have ! ;0) Hope you will release full footage unedited of inside and outside ! would be interesting to see !
Congratulations to Virgin team.....!
Dammit! why you bring us back to earth?- investor
🌎🛸 One step for man and one Giant Leap for man kind ! Awesome
Eat the rich.
Congratulations to entire team💐💐🤝
And the winner is... Sir Richard!
Maybe some day its affordable for us. 🙏
WOW! Thanks for inspiring us
Flatearthers in shambles
I'm sure it's impressive and all that.. and it's well done and such.. but.. space kinda has this karman line thing that you didn't cross..
you need to show this video to the people who believe the earth is flat!!!
It's ridiculous that some reporters call Richard Branson "astronaut". Flying to the edge of space is no big deal. Flying to a space station and staying there for a few days will be a big deal.
ryan air flights  cant even reach london somedays
Talk about living the dream. Congratulations to everyone who made this possible.
❤️❤️❤️❤️👍
This is better than fake moon landing.)
This should shut the flat earthers up.
2:15 We're being *curved-slapped* all over the place 😆🙄
Nice but what are the Cracks noises during all the 0 gravity ? Impacts ? And where is the onboard camera during reentry !!
that'll be $5934984048028020390293
Planning on paying any taxes to fund NASA?
At least England won something
Congratulations!  I'm glad that everything went well and y'all got back on Earth safely.
i just love it that he beat bozo to space lol
💕🙏💕
TOP !
So cool!
Ok
💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾🤘🏾🕶️🤘🏾
Who else was waiting for the window to pop?
What was the point though? Just to see Branston float about for a bit?
When you believe in your dream and going forward without looking back, finally you will achieve it! Congratz, this is The Great Inspiration for next generation of Engineers and scientist on our planet!
1:17 I love the way they threw the woman to each other like she's a football or something 😂😂
Вчера плакал от счастья, а сегодня от горя😞
Amazing, I would like to get to ride it in the future
1:13 O my O my O my 😂 where are the *flat-ballers* ??
The flight is too short! Soon as they got up there it was time to come down! Needs longer flights to be worth it, even if you're mega rich!
Wow thats all i can say.
Nice CGI
What's up virgins? 😂
I am a Virgin Galactic fan for sure!!! This is awesome!! Congratulations to Richard and the crew!!! I just ordered my Virgin Galactic space model for display, I was surprised there was only one left on the website I used!!😎
Nice SPO, scammers
WTF? Why VG shares go down so fast???
Ever wonder what a dream coming true would look like it you could film it? Well, here it is!
Outstanding! A bucket list item for sure!
That is so cool. Sir Richard realizes another dream come true.  On the downside, the Flat Earther consortium will experience an avalanche of naysayers unlike they've ever seen.
Wow
sorry flathearthers
Fake. The computer chips in the cameras used to record means this 100% CGI, which, as everyone knows is fake.
Would love it if they could stay up a little longer....so they could get at least 10 minutes of zero-G time.   Maybe give them some handholds so they're NOT clutching at the seals around those windows....LOL.   Saw Richard doing that.
0:56 my O my... will you just look at that juicy *curve.* ✋🤣🤚
WTF!   You screwed all the retail investors today by dumping all these new stocks on the market!  Shame on you!  Creep!  Stock symbol SPCE stinks of insider trading!  Glad you're rich!  Thanks for screwing your retailers.  I should had never purchased stocks in your company!
wow, great
Imagine seeing the face of people that believe that earth is flat :D
Congrats on beating Amazon Prime delivery drones to space!
Awesome adventure.  Congratulations.👍🏽
Wot
You fckn post couldn't wait 1 day to sell 500 million shares. We held for your company all this time and then you aht all over us.
It wasn't really space though. 100km is space
The SR-71 pilots wore pressure suits and harnesses at speeds beyond mach 3. If anyone believes this mind control show is real then you likely have vaccine damage.
My new life goal:  *Doing backflips in an aircraft in space*
Looks amazing. Anyone willing to give me 250k for a ticket? xD
Wow this just made history.
Congratulations! Even if it seems that you were hanging on tight to you're seat !
When tickets 1k?
People believing in flat Earth be like.... Photoshop....where are the stars....another cinematic movie for dummies
Hopefully within my our lifetimes we will get to a stage where it's affordable for us to go to space. Even if it something like $5000, it would be something I would save up for as it's something I'd like to do before I die. Although unfortunately I think that would be a normal thing for future generations and not ours. But the one thing our generation has that the future ones probably won't is Shrek DVDs so I guess it's not all bad.
Amazing!! Such an achievement 👏
Congrats! What a dream come true.
Remember kids, space flight can be yours too!  Just kidding, unless you're a billionaire.  Space and colonization especially in our lifetimes will be for the rich, earth and its dying atmosphere will be for the poor.
I hope one day...
Fake news... we all know that the earth is flat.  The flat earth society has members all around the globe    :D
This is actually Burt Rutens space ship. Branson has the finances to turn it into a commercial reality though.
42 за акцию, алё
Kiss bye bye to your idiotic delusions flat earthers.
Load of shite 🙄
Awesome!
What an inspiration!! Thank you!!!
Eyes have seen most beautiful this
I feel bad for Richard. He's trying to drop an inspiring line and people are fucking around and woo-girling his moment in history. What a group of fucking twats.
But not really though. *cough* Kármán line *cough*
Let’s get the footage from inside the cabin to see facial expressions at release and launch 🚀
I mean, what else do billionaires have to spend their money on? Actual real-world problems? Nah. Take me to space for 2 minutes.
Well, you can’t really call it a “spaceship” when you can’t even go to the moon with it… It’s just a rocket aircraft.
wow
I never thought i said this but if you are looking for a steward then i am happy to quit my current job:)
Ишь ты чего удумали!
Did they actually leave the atmosphere?
Maybe this generation of billionaires can invest in fighting climate change so there will be a planet for the next generation of dreamers to safely inhabit, not sure what blowing money going to space is going to do for our future generations.
reserve 1 seat for me
It means alot to see a billionaire investing his money in experiences and not just luxury
Want full unedited clips.
We congratulate Richard Branson on fulfilling his lifelong dream and becoming a true astronaut.
👍👍👏👏
Даже не достигли отметки в 80 км... в чем радость?!
Richard trying to return to his seat… whilst upside down 😂
🤷🏼‍♂️.....
Congratulations!
now we have a space shuttle go fix the hubble telescope please!!
In the movies it looks better. It is not seen leaving the atmosphere. Those too cheerful girls. I do not belive anything.
que caras bvons manos eu um dia estarei não so ai como nas estrelas
Humans are capable of such amazing things. Well done team!
Shame they didn't show the full drop, rocket upwards & the descent. Guess they would have been swearing their asses off fearing for their lives haha xD I wouldn't blame them!
That’s what money gets you guys and girls.  Keep dreaming 👍
Odd that they avoided showing an internal view during the burn.
Bezos and Musk seem like total tools. at least Branson seems kind of cool even though he is just another billionaire playing around.
The 1st step of being able to go and destroy a hole new planet way to go hope ya all leave sooner than later.
So, Richard, flat or round?
Super dangerous.....even if I had MULTI MILLIONS OF DOLLARS I WOULDN'T GO UP THERE. VIRGIN CANT PROMISE THAT KIND OF SAFETY IN SPACE....NOBODY CAN....a lot of floating trash up there remember that. IT DID LOOK KOOL THOUGH 😃👍
wHeRe aRe tHe aLiEnS???!
It didn’t feel real until Richard unstrapped and you could tell how strange it felt to have zero gravity. Wow
This looks so fake.
Environmentally friendly.
Lindo de mais estamos vendo a história sendo escrita, parabéns a Virgin Galactic 🇧🇷
Can someone explain what actually happened. Did they enter space and then return that day or what actually happened?
This is the quantum leap... This will reduce the cost of payloads into orbit my some orders of magnitude...
Wow, that is amazing! Great work, Virgin Galactic. It's like the first Polynesians out on the great Pacific Ocean way back when. Who knows what kind of islands in the sky are out there! Che Hooooa!!!!!
Who cares !! All you billionaires using all that money you made off the backs of poor hard working people. Now it’s Jeff’s turn the worst offender of making money off of the hard working class people. You go Jeff you go     Too hell
Need a bigger space ship guys
This are the kind of people ho inspire me I’m 12 right now, congrats to everyone 🎉
Our beloved Santhosh George Kulangara will be on the next board. This is just unbelievable ❤️
Nobody: FE: This is fake. They shooted this in studio
I would be speechless if I was on that trip, amazing speech Sir Richard! congratulations to you and the team!!
Спасибо за допэмиссию. Разочарован
Congratulations ! BIG dream !
richard branson what an amazing man. He truly deserves living his childhood dream
Most savage and coolest pilots ever
У них на спине парашюты заранее у всех одеты??? )))
Isn't this the same pick who was coming around with his begging bowl. Branson, baby, make your next trip, oblivion .that would really be worth watching.
Amazing !! Congrats
😍😍
When can I go for a ride unkle Branson
So green
Thank you
Richard Branson = dork
He was wearing airpods pro for noise cancellation
just imagine the price of admission though. other than that I think it's amazing also Congrats to the entire Virgin Galactic team I know this took a long time to build and I'm very happy to have seen it work.
That must have been intense!
"Branson was one of six Virgin Galactic employees aboard VSS Unity for the voyage to 280,000 feet".... The Karman line, which defines the boundary between Earth's atmosphere and outer space. is at an altitude of 330,000 feet... Seems you didn't quite make it into space, Richard... Of course, I suspect your calculations will be in line with NASA, the US Space Force, US Air Force and Federal Aviation Administration who define the boundary as 50 miles 264,000 feet... Either way, you may have reached the edge of space but you certainly did not go into space...
I'd like to see footage from the pilots viewpoint...
Billionaires Care Nothing for the planet’s Eco System and GLOBAL WARMING.   In time this will all be seen as pointless and profit making .  All those Emissions which is unnecessary !   Shame on these people .  Our planet needs care and respect
Well, there goes the flat eath theory😭
seems hes doing more than Elon at the moment
A huge example of mankind's lack of wisdom.  Space tourism for the masses?  What an unbelievably stupid and tone-deaf pursuit in 2021.  Too many child-like rich people must have loved Star Wars too much.
хули акции вниз пошли?
Please upload the video of the inside cabin view , when unity dropped and when accelerating towards Karmen line.
A man who had a dream and did it. Congratulations Sir Richard Branson and the whole Virgin Galactic team.
This is what real zero-G looks like. The dynamicity of it all. Everyone moving at the same time. Hair flapping around. All of the ISS fraudsters take note of what zero-G should really look like!
They need to burn longer or drop higher they need at least 300, 000 feet
listen to lil 2xkid music on youtube and audiomack
Nice CGI
The rich get richer
His hands were shaking in excitement
How much did he spend on a carnival ride??
Hey folks , Isn't the same fella who ask to get his company bailed out by tax Payers Money during lockdown ? 🙈
Despite what judgemental people say, I congratulate all at Virgin Galactic for this great accomplishment, and wish them and Virgin Orbit continued success.
amazing
Hmmm an hour or so trip with 3 mins of 0 gravity costing $300k per seat. Id rather wait for spacex to go to the moon when its affordable
Is there any way to maintain that altitude for a bit longer?
Another victory for white people!
Great now how about you and all the other ultrarich billionaires start spending money to clean up all the fkin messes you and your predecessors made down here?
moar!!!
So the passengers dont need helmets or oxygen masks just the pilots?
Amazing ! Well done Sir Richard…well done Virgin Galactic…
Just amazed by this, feels like they just took a flight to space and came back within minutes.
Only 2 minutes in zero G?  That's disappointing. It's a bit of a stretch to call it a spaceship.
That shot of it speeding past it's carrier reminded me of Nasa test footage and made me realize, we are in the next generation of aerospace.
Although it's not a lot of time in Space,its still cool that we are having a big step in Space Tourism
1:20 “Imagine to the next generation of dreamers, if we can do this, imagine what you can do!”
Congrats! But technically that's not space
ОХХУЕННО
I wish one day this flight experience will have a face of  Giveaway ,  well u never know 😍
Wow. Congratulations !. They would have more fun if they orbited the earth a few times and came back down !
wow it looked like they were playing catch with that chick.....the ship looks like a romulin bird of prey stright out of star trek....does it have a cloaking device......
why the share is going deep down???!!
Congratulations virgin galactic. Some set backs but. YOU DID IT!!!!
I wonder if any flat earth believer would like to paid for a trip in this spaceship to see if the earth is really flat
You could tell Richard was overwhelmed. He was trying to be inspirational to the younger generation. Hopefully the younger Snowflakes will stop complaining about being victims and realise that the only way the World will improve and the save the planet is that they show the work ethic, passion and willing to overcome dyslexia to reach the stars. Congratulations Richard the world needed this wonderful news just now.
😘💓👍😊🤩👏🚀⭐
Lololol. Goin to space is racist and just furthered global warming. - democrats 2021
Great where can we sign up for flight like this
Just a rollercoaster ride for billionaires. All those carbon emissions are for lulz
do you actually believe what you see? lots of fakery and deceptiveness has been increasingly common. all of this is nothing but deception/magic. all these bransons and musks should remain in space permanently if this was truth.
well its definitely not flat lol.
Branson could write a check to resolved work hunger but choose this instead.
Congratulations Branson 👏. This is truly amazing 🥺🤍👏👏👏 I'll definitely go to space 🙂😇
they skipped the reentry. must've not been very appealing from a marketing standpoint
Sirisha bandla from Andhra Pradesh Space research and scientist (vice president of Virgin galactic space company) and astronaut proud moment for Telugu people
Incredible!
AMAZING!!! (But 32 thumbs down - flat earth believers don't think so)
😀❤️
build a large space station that can house over a million people
Was he trying to open the window at 2:22?
Amazing to see this! Imagine what the future holds 🚀 Can't wait!
Looks like fun.  It would be great to see more cockpit video footage of the flight too.
People still saying the earth is flat ! Are you sure now 😒😟🤔😉
this is fake becouse the eath is flat becouse the spaceship siits flat on the ground but in space you can see that the spaceship is not curved so there is now way that it can sit straight on the ground if the earth is round
So little time ... the journey up and away was incredible with the Virgin logo ... and to look back on all that we know and love about our wonderful planet earth x o California
Wonderful to see the wealthiest having fun during this grim period....lets see them joyfully off into space: every elitist multi millionaire heading off into the stars.
where are the Flat Earthers?
Замечательно!
I wonder how much higher Unity could go before they were in serious trouble, stuck in a low orbit or something?
43 dislikes from flat earthers
20 kilometers higher and you reach space! So so close, well done team! 😂
Sir Richard Branson, the Earth is round or flat? )
Great job virgin galactic for flying the spaceplane with a full crew to space!
I think Kerbal Space should add a new Kerbonaut: sir Richard Kerman ;^)
So freaking cool!!!
Brings tears to my eyes :,)
A bit odd to call these tourists on a parabolic flight on steroids "Astronauts". Kind of devaluates the true meaning of the word.
One step closer to Star-wars.
Innovation & Execution @100% Accuracy
Sounds of space orgasms.
👏
Next mission is build a Hotel in Space. Arrange weekend trips to the Space Hotel.
It never happened, it was all CGI filmed in a green screen Hollywood basement! 😂
Дед, мы гордимся тобой! Привет из России!
Why Stock Down?
Great to see the mission was a success. A bit scary to realize that on the way back the plane/rocket had no fuel and it was gliding?
All they need to do now is work on increasing the time in zero-g with each new generation of planes. Exciting future.
What a waste of precious resources just so rich people can go to edge of space and get their jollies. Screw you
Sir Branson has a face so proud when he's giving his speech, constantly looking at mother Earth. Absolutely love this!
1 minute of w8lessness ...  facepalm
$250K for that? Would you pay it?
Thanks for allowing us to hear the sounds without music
The water must be fun down there 😂,; going deep into the ocean I seen the bubbles my guy lol
ബഹിരാകാശത്തു നിന്ന് സൂര്യനെ  നടക്കാൻ എന്ത് രസമാണ്
Congratulations !!!
Great job Virgin Galactic team
Hey it looks like paper plane 🤔
He's shaking like a leaf
I remember when they first announced the Virgin Galactic. Incredible to FINALLY see this.
Branson Musk and Bezos what a cool dudes
Pretty awesome. I'm happy for those folks and extremely jealous. Your move Bezos
Its really weird that everyone else on the flight was imediatly out of there seats and enjoying  being in microgravity, but Richard is firmly strapped in and looks and sounds very nervous and if he gripped that seat a bit tighter, he'd snap it clean off. I don't think he was enjoying the experience. which is not a great image, as he's an older man who's been dreaming of space most of his life. now that he's on the edge, he looks like he wants to get back on the ground as soon as possible.
For 200k, not worth it. No meals and no entertainment. With all the space debris, I doubt the view will be worth it either. I rather go to the space bubble in Disney land.
Ричард, ты Великий человек! Твой пример заряжает миллионы людей по всему миру верить в свою мечту! Я очень рад, что мне повелось жить с тобой в одно время!
Wow
I’ve been in marketing and advertising for almost forty years, that is the single greatest logo placement I have ever seen.
thanks for the inspiration sir
I'd like to see some congrats to Burt Rutan & Scaled Composites for his ship design & the innovative approach that made this possible.
Is the earth flat?
only 5 mins though.
Cringe, not a space flight but a high altitude flight. Wake me up when they cross the Karman line, which they didn't.
max hight and weightlessness period lenght?
I was waiting for one of those UFOs to sneak up behind you.
Congratulations, perhapse next flight you might make it to space.
Amazing! Congratulations! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Why pilots in masks, but other guys without?
Although this is historic, it makes me sad to think that with all these resources billionaires could genuinely help the world end things like poverty, homelessness and generally help those who are struggling to make ends meet. Most people in the US specifically are living paycheck to paycheck and we're an abundantly wealthy nation. Imagine how poor other people are in the world.   We should enter space as a species, together, as opposed to the wealthy leaving the poor behind.
Is it just me or does the earth look really FLAT?  The fish eye lens is the only thing that gives it a curve!  This is really going to fuel the Flat Earth theorists.
This man is a DOER!!!! He fulfilled  his dream and on his way he brought along many great engineering minds. The Virgin Galactic is not only beautiful to look at but the flight went like a movie. Congratulations to all involved, especially to Mr. Branson!
In the future, people will look back on July 11, 2021 as the day ordinary people began to go to space.
JUst WoW Look Branson So fulfilled
I wonder how many g's the crew experience when the rocket fires??
Wow Wowoooooo.
Woww interesting  Santhosh George kulangaraയെ ഇനി വരുന്ന രണ്ടുമാസം ഏതെങ്കിലുമൊരു ദിവസം കാണാൻ സാധിക്കും എന്ന് പ്രതീക്ഷിക്കുന്നു
this is cool, but i think spending 5 grand to ride on one of those 0g airplanes is a far better value, and probably alot safer
awesome
Cool beans but what is the noise that sounds like something is pounding on the outside of the space craft ?
It's a higher altitude vomit comet.
bro, where is the restroom lol ???????????
They should design the seats to fold in automatically when the person stands up to have more room. Before they are ready to go back the seats go up again.
proud to say I witnessed this live
so sick!!! congrats Richard for this great achivement!!
I love you Indian sister sirisha Di  🥰🥰
How come you guys never show their faces when the rocket motor ignites? I want to see their face expressions during the entire boost phase. Would like to see a complete view looking back as the rocket goes straight up.
the power of being rich to hire smart ppl to archive your dream
Would've loved to see a longer, unedited version.  Congrats nonetheless!
Yes YES I see the earth is flat!!! This flight show the truth :-D
Next generation of dreamers....check. well done.
Weren't they actualy falling?
i know about virgin galactic is a space organisation today and came here instantly. CONGRATULATION
It is virgin from tesla ceo.
It's inspiring!
I cried when he said imagine what you can do?
Thank you thank you thank you Virgin Galactic. I'm going to make sure I have a chance to see this view for myself one day!
Couldn't they spend more time up there?
I truly feel like this way of getting space planes closer to the atmosphere will help space tourism move forward.
Also, suborbital flights before use non-reusable rocket hardwares, but today everything is now reusable! We hope eventually the cost per flight will dramatically go down!
Fake, Earth is flat!
Stanley Kubrick is a genius
And Space is now available to ordinary people...
I never expected that they will make history. Thanks as a teen  I can now  hope to go into space. Thanks a lot
What we want to see. "In-car camera footage" of those two points (of the passengers) when the rocket is released and g-forces/thrust engages.. (the look on faces during that phase) AND (2.) that phase inside when the g-forces of re-entering seem to be unique and amazing. What does it look like inside, as passengers feel the transition from space back to "flight"? (hoping for this footage)
How can record video  the ship bottom??
2:26 INTERSTATELLAR
1:00 And everyone in the cabin said "Shutup old man and start floating"
Feeling happy for Richard Branson
Fabulous to see the views from space. Amazing effort from all involved. This will change space as we know it.
guess this is the end of flat earth era
70yo first time in space. Its absolutely unbelievable.
It's an inspiration for us... Thanks man
This being awesome is an major understatement
This had nothing to do with science or space travel and only served to massage and grow the ego and vanity of richard branson.
Don't just say amazing, wow, etc invest in the stock and be part of it!!!!
Better than fixing homelessness?!?
🔥🔥🔥🔥
success and future are in the sky. Sir richard bronson.
Congratulations!
I am so happy for everyone involved in the mission.. congratulations! You are all my heroes
truly inspiring..❤❤
It's amazing what you can accomplish when you don't pay taxes.
Welcome to space

Thank you. This is what exactly i was looking for
go for the 100 why not...
Flat earthers crying right now
Congrats to the whole crew!
Congrats!
Congrats to Virgin Galactic 🤍
Branson has to go again with Elon. Half is zero G time was taken up in the speech :D
Respect to you! Congrats!
Amazing times
This is unbelievable! So happy for Rich and the Team! Let's hope with time they can improve the price of tickets and the Livestream quailty!! Congrats everyone!
I would think that, for a man who has it all and is rarely moved by things, it speaks volumes just how excited he was during this experience.  Imagine how every day people would react!
Looks like an airplane to me not a spacecraft.  Rich man's toy...... nothing else.
Must b nice when someone who is rich can travel into space.  I know that Bryson saved 4 yrs but how about the poor person
THE EARTH IS FLAT
Why are rich people so focused on leaving this planet? WHAT ARE THEY NOT TELLING US?
This looks unreal... Crazy to think you can go to space like some kind of rollercoaster ride in 2021
Here bigins the new era of space exploration🤩
Nice SPO cover-up btw XD
massive props to the pilots! manual for reaaall!
Fabulous !
Need to advance the tech to allow completion of one orbit. And bigger windows!
Красавчики!!! Продолжайте в том же духе!!! 💪🤝👋
Congrats to virgin Galactic for the historical achievement.... 🤍
i love it !! F5 F5 F5
The stock did the opposite today
Would love to see the reentry from the cabin with sounds Congrats Virgin Galactic
Fking inspirational ❤️

Fenomenal!!!
Thank you sir for inspiring the young generation.
Literally wonderful. Congratulations! 🚀
