Thank you for supporting us and our journey to make real working lightsabers.
Can u light a cigar with them
Calling them lightsabers is a stretch.
00:21 love the back to the future reference
Bro made light daggers and light claymores lol
I don’t have enough money but I want it soooooooo badly
What’s the latest on progress for real light sabers without the cords?
I want the good one or nothing
@hacksmith please settle something for me and a friend lol. Around the 9 minute mark you make a comment about your clean room being where “patient zero” started. Is this, or is it not, a reference to the Joe Ledger book series by Johnathan Mayberry? Or was it just an off hand comment?
bros a real-life tonystark
Guys I've been watching your journey from the very beginning. This has come so far, but it seems your just getting started. Is there any way we can get your guys to present Hayden Christensen with an improved Saber? I know he would have a great time with you guys
Whyyy do I get this video in weird spanish????
a fine addition to my collection
Do you guys sell this mini sabers for Brazil ? I want to give one for my father for father's day.
now all we need is to have them actually clash and extend that run time and you'll have a REAL lightsaber
Imagine pulling up to the sesh and ripping a bowl with a lightsaber.
I am happy to say this video, helped me diagnose how to disassemble, and clean mine and replace it's ignighter after the PZOignither called it quits, Thanks GuYs!
THE CAKE IS A LIE!
Que horrible traducción al español no se entiende nada de lo que dicen
Those lightsabers will be perfect for opening boxes toasting marshmallows and getting a haircut definitely a must have thanks for trying to make every star wars nerd happy it means a lot
Lightdagger
Dabs 😂
But can i take a dab with it?
Looks good for the dab rig yo
It’s literally just a dropshipping product you can get for 7 dollars on AliExpress I feel bad for anyone who paid 100 dollars for it literally just a lighter
Bought my first gen 2 mini saber, I appreciate your guy’s determination to make this reality!!
its lighter not lightsaber..product for dumbasses
Light dagger, I will be buying one as soon as I I not broke.
So this means we can take apart our mini lightsaber and make it our own color!
Kinda like the saber knife used to cut/toast bread in Hitchhiker's Guide lol
In my 11th grade English class, we had to write an essay about a problem in our world that could be solved by science. My problem was that lightsabers don't exist in real life.  Problem solved.
wouldnt it be safer if you used a compressor, so you make sort of a jet engine
What separates this from other butane lighters?
What kind of drone is that at a little before 8:20?
I have a question will the real lightsabers without the cord be sold in like 5 years?
11:50 Wow, hating on someone working to create something that no one’s been able to do before is just insane
My only complaint is about the light side minisaber the crome plating wore off after about 8 months but other that that they are perfect
What about a retractable tungsten rod heated by the current plasma lightsaber
I really want to hold one of the big ones they look super good
And besides, you guys want light sabers, not blow torches
May I throw in a little bit of constructive criticism try using crystal and focusing crystal that’s in the design along with an electric powered laser pointer, same principle as the magnifying glass but enhanced by 10 fold simple science very complicated to do
Lightsabers... ARE REAL!!!!!!!!
is it possible to use a methalox mixture for the saber?
Is it possible to refuel a mini saber?
how much🥰😍💖???
bro how is this legal?
I defentliy oder one
You said that the big ones are not ready yet. But when its ready then we can Bus it
2:22 love the edits🤣
My only problem with the mini sabers is that they are pretty much just a lighter what I mean is the length of the flame is pretty small but still cool
I know it's a stupid opinion but you can't really swordfight with this. So is it s saber?
If you support this! Leave our 2ed Amendment alone! 😂 yea we dont always need stuff like this but we want it!!! Thats good enough for me
But what if I want to put it on iron man arm
dont make the lightsabers hot enough to cut tungsten so it can act like beskar
1. could you put a saber in both the orignal proto saber hilt and the first hilt 2. could you also make a cartdrige that could allow for quick swaps like magazines
We call them cigarette lighters
I want a lightsaber
What really puzzled me in SW is the fact they actually clash against each other. I mean sure you could make a portable laser/plasma beam which could cut through anything, but the fact the blades clash means either that they are in fact solid or... I don't know 🤔
Those are just blow torches
This is a future "Model T"
You should make a working nokia phone but it's actually indestructible
Yoooo hacksmith. Is there any way to make an attachment for a lightsaber to be put in my current prosthetic socket??
Faszinierend, nur das die Lichtschwerter nie so sein werden das Sie sich nicht gegenseitig durchdringen werden! 😉
El doblaje en español latino es malisimo
15:44 what type of machine is that hydrogen generator? (Brand name or more specific name) As can see that would be very useful in making canisters for welding use, but when you search hydrogen generator or hydrogen water generator, you just get a bunch of results for water bottles that do some electrolysis to make bubbles. (Guessing for some 'healthy' fad? 🤷🏻‍♂️) definitely not what is shown.
What do i do if im 16 and dont have a credit card
Bunsen burner.
Crazy hope my order is in stock and Canada delivery is fast lol
Cool Chinese cigarette lighter.
you should make the proton and neutrona wand from either the THE REAL GHOSTBUSTERS tv series or the 1980 film GHOSTBUSTER. thanks and i think it will be a great video! keep up the great work
Does the mini Saber work in cold weather? Like in the winter without problems and windy environments. Is it water proof, like against rain?
Are the mini sabers available anymore?
yo im about to buy a mini-saber does it still come with the coin? I am a HUGE fan of your videos I have watched almost all of them except like 2
The hydrogen one (with a color chemical added to make the flame visible) might produce a better likeness to a lightsaber - at least based on the side-by-side view that you provided in the video (with the thermal camera).
can you please make honey lemon purse?
Basically it's a strong lighter 😂
So I'ma subscribe.
This is like watching The Office
Cant wait when like 20 years later i look at youtube and see "we finally did it a real life perfect light saber"
Can i do a request how about a robot iron golem
Fallout power armor
so, he invented zipo on gas?
if you want, I can dub your's and your's team's voice in Hindi/Gujarati.
how about for fighting with it? (i know this question is stupid but just imagine) what i would is, same as yours but with expandable metal rod that can withstand the heat. Then blow of the fire around the rod. The rod and the light would eignite at the same time.  Finally if the rod is hot enough, you can cut, stab, and most importantly FIGHT
My daughters just bought me one of these for Father’s Day!!!  It’s awesome.
Do double blade star Wars ⚔️
Pls how can I get a light saber that brings  out fire like the one you used in the intro
That's a new low
You guys really should aim for becoming the next ibm but for lightsaber and other sci-fi weapons that become reality
Liquid oxygen 💀☠️
“Oh how I’d love an overpowered lighter!
No purple color change?
Bro if you want to make a lightsaber in just the hilt make the mini saber bigger
and their less than a hundred dollars😭
No, Mom, I don’t vegetables! I just want chicken fingers gosh!😾
+1SUB
OOOOO!
Curious how long gen 3/4/5 will last. I’ll buy them when there’s more practical longevity to them
GG
Build a real size bay stadium
Sonic the hedgehog  flying  boare
Wish they had a rose gold lightsaber design. Then I'd at least get that for my pyro tendencies lol.
Si el canaaal es ingles porque suena en españoooll
How can i get this mini one, links  in description dont work, need new lighter, pls help
Made fallout armor pleas
Were those machines' individual parts sterilized including the tools used to assemble them?  I'm just curious as to how thorough you'd have to be.
I thought getting to absolute zero was impossible 2:19
What About PURPLE
Happy star wars day
Can I just fit the internals into a pre built custom Saber?
hey EU link is brokee
Kyber crystals. I remember experiments where we turned liquid into crystal. So liquid oxygen crystals be the next step.
Next make a lightsaber with the changesite-(Y) as a kyber crystal
I had an idea which probably can’t work but why can’t you make a light saber out of a bunch of lasers and a mirrors. I fell like it would work so well.
O    sabre   de   luz  atravessar  cimento   e    ferro  é   metal 😅
Can you guys utilize a crystal powered lightsaber
You should make a real life cold saber
This is legit mad science
Your actually making a lightsaber type called a Shoto saber
Parabéns pelo projeto. Sei que não é culpa de vocês, mas esta é a pior dublagem para português que eu já vi na minha vida.
Dude makes starwars real befor iron man
AI dub, why?
Y'all didn't create these
hacksmith dublado? bem mal dublado na real
esa IA de traducción es muy mala! le cambia el acento y los tonos de voz constantemente, busquen otra
That 1 deliver was with shorts and a T-shirt outside when it was snowing respect 🫡 🫡 🫡
How do you refill your mini light saber
Your sabers are now as weapons in the game Crossout 😂😂
Fuck! I can barely afford even _one_ but I can't decide between the Sith or the Jedi saber...
At this point i wouldn't be surprised if it turns out these guys are secretly some Lex Luthor type supervillains with secret labs full of messed up human experiments in a deep underground basement.
Oh man , these guys are nuts ...but its awesome nuts
Next step, make blasters😅
May the force be with you
will the white edition be available on the store?
Nice laboratory james
I Would prefer actual lightsaber than a fancy lighter.💀
Begun the Clone wars have
I’ve bought one but no matter how much lighter butane I put , my saber is the size of a lighter. Please help
Might be a stupid question, but why don’t they use hydrogen instead of LPG for the lightsabers?
Make a Ultraman suit
Bro don't sell this stuff 😂. We gonna have mini terrorists running around with lightsabers.
Potential government funding?🤔
3 years to make a gas lighter, ok.
such a coincidence that the hacksmith industries logo looks like a Clone trooper helmet instead of an anvil and some tools
Check out now these awesome colorful lighters.
I have an idea for how to make a lightsaber. u should use an actual laser and just have a pulse thing going in front of it and away from it very fast creating the same efect as a lightsaber
i dont trust you enough that i would use it but i love that you do this
Kinda jarring thinking at some point in my lifetime someone will make a fully functional lightsaber
Esta bien qlera la traducción jajaja
holy jesus invisible flame one is sick
This man out here doing the lords work!
Bro made a fancy lighter and said it was a lightsaber💀💀
yeah!
If you can find a way to make the plasma beam longer you can make a better Ironman repulsor
I'm not dying until i'm becoming a jedi, so that my son could say "Like my father before me"
hmmm found the mini saber on amazon for a third the price but I guess it costs $45 to put your logo on it say you designed it.
You guys should stick to non lighter or flame lightsabers! I aodred the lightsabre you guys made like a soldering machine one. One with a stick that turns very hot
Lmaooooo he reference the LTT screw driver bahahahaha
It's really awesome.
So mauga chain guns from overwatch
Are these dropshipped like the previous mini-saber?
I might stop carrying a gun and carry this instead
This could also help killers if you gave it to them😮
You should need a license for that, right???
Question these guys are doing history rn bro and doesn't have 2 billion subs like bro made our childhoods true🥺
Talks about liquid oxygen for rockets, then shows a clip of the one rocket that uses APCP
Dabs?
Could you pleas try create the star wars Battlefront ll drone ?
I have a subnose G.T.T. Mirage. is that what these are? Mirages used as the base?
I have an idea for the lightsaber. Tesla made conetionless light bulb, do you think it could have any use in the lightsaber project?
I’m just waiting for hacksmith to make a real proton pack
Cant wait for real lightsabers
is there a delivery to Russia?
Class 100 is the equivalent to iso 5/ grade A that’s used in bio manufacturing and regulated by the fda and ema. These environments r complicated and very expensive. I’m surprised what yall managed to do with only 700k us. Very cool stuff, and congrats on actually seeing ur goal thru
Of course the first order of a light saber is from texas💀
!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Wow awesome yeah
One heck of a video! It’s absolutely amazing to see how far all the tech has come! With regard to the lightsaber itself, how does one refill it when it runs out?
WTH?! I've been watching this channel for 2 years now. How did I not subscribe already?!?!?!
Except all the mini ones are out of stock
Os mini sabres vem pro Brasil????
Thets a dagger lightsaber.  And pls make a yellow colored normal sized light saber.

How to get sued in 3 steps
are the mini light sabers hot
. Very impressive IMO. You are one talented person. Wishing you all the best. Has Disney approved this? Just wondering, since they can be so litigious at times.
I can see my grandson inside the jedi council seats arguing why he can't be a jedi
can you ship it to india...?
11:50 "those are just torches not a real lightsaber" "its not a lightsaber its a flame thrower nice try though" mf YOU DO IT see how easy it is
Is this just a spicier lighter?
Cleanrooms are fun. Worked briefly as IT support at a company with a cleanroom-within-a-cleanroom. As a bonus, they worked with high powered magnets, so there were separator kits every few metres as well.
❤🎉
Are I going to sell real full sized lightsaber
I swear I've seen this lighter before, did you guys not get a patent? Cuz there's a lighter youtube channel that's been selling this for a while.
Looks cool but it's not a lightsaber it's glorified lighter
Have you ever gotten legal threats from Disney over this?
Unfortunately every gas station beat you to the punch this is a glorified lighter
How has the government not funded you and take notice yet?
True pioneers! Awesome job guys!
Hello HsckSmith Great Channel Great Work. Take A Look At Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol in The Open Scene were the MI Agent jump's off a tall building and throws out a small packages thst expands and inflates into extra  ballooned  cushion and  And Broke his fall. Is That actually possible and can it be made? What do You think? Thanks for All The Great Hard Work and  Innovation. Thanks
Team, you must find the perfect battery. Go to the theoretical sections, there you’ll find Kaku-sensei to help guide your path to a jedha

Im Going to buy the large light saber when it’s finished
Awesome
Where are they made? In what country?
You made a Lightsaber dagger
You should try and make the sonic screwdriver from doctor who
Mini lightsaber: ✖️ Light knife: ✔️
Get small with turbines and make it air powered- only need to carry combustion
do a working portal gun
Bogdan plays warframe!!
I’ll be back one day to get a light saber 🫡
Don't get me wrong I think it's amazing what you have achieved and love the chanel... But 3 years on basically an electric butane lighter ?
As an engineer my dream job is working with you
I can’t wait to see what “Florida men” do with this when light sabers are reality 🤦🏻‍♂️
Tbh this more like a flame saber
Hey hacksmith I got an idea for the light saber make a tungsten light saber that is retractable it doesn't matter if it is tungsten just a material that can withstand the heat of the light saber and it is retractable you can make it a blade so that it can automatically cut thing instantly so that you  can not worry about the physics
Could you please make a amber/ rays mini saber color
Mines taking over a month to ship because of the red color switch, whats up?
I don't even have a place to change my oil and these guys are doing this.  That's so awesome.  The... the second part.
so do all combustible gasses.  It is no more dangerous than gasoline.
they are lighters
Greedy
Mine is still better
do you sell a hydrogen battery
You should build a life size working x wing
Que malo es el doblaje en español, no entiendo nada, entiendo más en inglés.
0:34 ... dude, that's an amazing tablet.
Can you make force lighting
Hi, im late to this video. Please sell the hydrogen one!
Please be careful of the distiller you're using. I know this type of model and it shouldn't be trusted with maintaining perfect distillation. You need to use the ones from a local distillation lab with certificates for guarantee
Not the Aperture logo😭
Yo so i ordered my lightsaber around a month ago and its still not here, says it hasn’t been picked up by the delivery service yet. Could i possibly get a timeframe of when it might arrive?
Can't you extract oxygen from the water or air to get fuel, like you did with hydrogen?
ahhh shit it's been 3years ?
Next step: keep growing mini Lightsaber little by little Step 54:I feel Creating Barrier would be very useful step for Lightsaber  step 87 : create barrier sword (Barrier line) with heavy backpack Step 128: Combine Barrier with Light Saber (heavy back pack) Step 152: mini barrier saber (100% Mini-sable) Step 183: keep growing mini barrier Lightsaber little by little Step 223: We have 100% Lightsaber  Other Ideas Green Goblin Glider and Bombs.
You are literally Tony stark 🤟👨‍🔬
Where can I get the light saver at
Maybe I can try my luck with buying this version compared to the white one. I even made a review about the product just to give it 5 stores.
Not to undermine this project, but isn't this just a jet lighter with the juice cranked up?  The full sized ones were actually plasma.
Wow amazing ⚡⚡🌟⭐🌐💯
In canon these would be called Lightdaggers. Weapons used by Jedi and Sith in desperate moments; whether for assassination, defense, or engineering.
You call it a light saber i say its perfect for ny dab rig thanks
How do you call that a proto saber? Your proto saber uses oxygen while a real one would be using a battery pack that creates Exited electronics and plasma XD not oxygen
Y'all should try to do a co-video with @styropyro and make a real-life Powerhammer from the 40k Universe With your machining skills and his insane ability to mess around with electricity I think the product you would create would come pretty close to the fictional thing hahahahahahah
next video: let's make a real portal gun!
i wish i could buy them but there to much 😫
After watching this video, I'm am confident in your lightsaber as I will ever be. Buying one when I can
Is it possible to make a real scouter from Dragon ball z??
El doblaje a veces no se entiende nads
Congratulations! I been watching you guys on and off for some years; and I feel this is a very well deserved milestone for you guys. You didn't just all of a suddenly release this lightsaber product, it's been a long grueling endeavor that we've been following you guy's through this entire time. So if the admiration of a complete stranger matter's any to you guys, you have mine and I'm very impressed with what you guy's have done with this channel, and I wanted to express that by congratulating you guy's; imo you truly deserve this success.
Percy Jackson sword aka pen
So I bought one with other stuff and an autograph... Was supposed to get here January 2nd.   I still don't have it, the tracking number provided cannot locate my package AND I wrote to you guys 7 days ago and STILL haven't received an answer from anybody.   Fairly disappointed.....
Can you make the jet gun from call of duty?
Hacksmith I live in Australia and I can not get one In the shop pls help me
So do you think you guys can make leviathans breath from destiny2
I’m not satisfied just getting a mini saber I have waited my whole life to get a real saber it’s pretty disappointing to be stuck with a tiny saber that only has the power lvl of a bic lighter I hope to get a full size lightsaber
can you make one for butane that has like a bigger flame like 10 15 20 without it being really big would love you more please and thank you
Where did you go to get your supplies?
That's some solid stuff🥃
In star wars lightsabers had cords
Imagine this scene: -"Mommy i dropped my mini saber" -"EVERYONE GET OUT OF THE HOUSE"   Anyway, I still find this extremely fun
Ya all have come light years from the old Garage.  Congratulations.
Well... according to lore, the lightsabers also had to be made exactly right or they'd explode.
I wonder if you could grow the reactive salts into a large (kyber) crystal and somehow use that in a way that wouldnt distort the flame..   One possibility would be if you could grow it large enough and then laser cut it to be a large mesh or solid ring   would last much longer than the couple minutes each colour changing insert currently lasts
I’m 14 and I want one but idk if it’s legal for me to own it 😂
Of course it's almost $150 fuck that shit
I can't imagine making those massive mega-sabers just for a bit
back to the future refrence nice
Can I flame my suvie steak with this
can i work for u
lol - the class 1 clean room is for like biohazardous materials.
Y'all should work with styropyro he knows how to build lasers and his knowledge of light sabers and with y'all together I bet you can make real lightsaber 🤌
I love the back to the future reference at the start
That one guy who had the light sabre in his mouth
Hey what to do when the fuel runs out, I can't see a replacement on the store
Can’t you just take the mini Sabre and just scaled up to make a fully contained light sabre
a
Now all we need is to have lightsaber fights
ballavasuradedoblajeenespanol
This makes me excited for the future. Unfortunately I can't buy a mini-saber, but instead I will try to watch all your videos. Good luck with a real lightsaber!😃
Yes, I think I now how we will fight in the 3 world war.
What's happening with the shipping of these?  I ordered mine over 3 weeks ago but it still hasn't shipped and the store says they are in-stock?  Also no reply when I sent an email chasing the order.  I know it's been the holiday season but not for 3 weeks.....I see something on the store about orders placed after 15 December being delayed but my order was on the 15 and there was no warning then.
La voz en español es molesta :(
Make batman's cape (make it glide)
Can you make me a master chief helmet from halo infinite plz I would love to have one
Can you please make the blades of chaos or the leviathan axe. It would be cool seeing them both in real life🙏
Pls make odm geer from attack on titan pls pls pls pls I am begging you for it to happen pls pls
But the mini saber cost 89€ witch is were much
Nah im good .. thats way to dangerous to handle 😂
essa dublagem tá muito bizarra kkkkkk
Your lightsaber kind of looks like the edgehawk lightsaber in Jedi survivor
Can you release a big version of the hydrogen saber ? I want .. no one has to know how dangerous it is
So idea, you mentioned that to make a plasma beam it can be held together by a magnetic field in your first lightsaber video. So what if instead of having the magnets around it they were inside it with the plasma being held and sort of pulled towards a blade of sorts with a strong magnetic field
It is a lighter
I now want it, but it will explode in my hands
the dab saber
bro I am in India so how can I buy it?
How do you refuel it
amazing video
this is craazy
Cool now l can light my cigars just like my pocket butane lighter
watit can i get this in australia? they are very strict on what they consider “weapons”
that is REALLY impressive
Lame
So it’s a lighter
The criminals...
Will it be possible to clash in the future?
if you hid a stiletto blade inside it you'd have a warhammer 40k power dagger. would also clash with other energy blades of it's kind.
Guys I really like your light lightsabers and you’ve done a really good job… but they need to actually clash with each other
You should totally come to comicon South Africa and sell these. Even bring your other products, I would love to have the engineers bible to.
Could you make a tardis PLEASE IDK IF ITS POSSIBLE BUT I THINK YOU COULD
Time to make a crème brûlée using a lightsaber
So how much for a fully sized one
So it's basically a cool lighter
you're basically making a mini rocket if you use enough to create the explosive thrust
*Just imagine how their lightsabers will be 10 years from now...*
I think their next project should be to make a working Barbatos from the IRON-BLOODED ORPHANS cuz that would be  awesome.
I love the Back to the Future reference in the beginning.
Imagine buying a super expensive real lightsaber and then using it as a flashlight.
This will be great for the dab rig
perfect
These are so cool, can’t wait to see a Darksaber one
Que dublagem é essa😂😂
I love how well volatility just hones in everyone's focus and attention. The safe, sane, and fun demonstrations of it. Baby sabers are dope.
So eu que achei a dublagem pra portugues um pouco estranha
So is owning one of the mini lightsabers dangerous because of the liquid oxygen then?
Where and when i can it buy
light dagger
Yo, please make more mini saber 2s  site says sold out on most of them 🙏
I was thinking about and dont wanna search your whole Video Galerie, did you ever built double jump shoes?
Thank you you made the first lightsaber ❤
hello how are you guys i wanted to say Hacksmith  you are the best . please make a very big robot with wheels
Your such an original entertaining channel, keep up the good work man!
Another step closer towards having lightsabers just like star wars. Keep up the good work and good luck towards making lightsaber versions to one day look just like the ones from star wars universe 👍
Personal defence..better than a tazer
This can’t be legal
Att magnetic particles to the oxygen and so the ssaber stays in place
a thought occured to me. your efforts have been to create a purely plasma state weapon. the ones in the movies are solid and can perry other sabres. consider adding a tubular heat proof fabric mesh (plasma sock if you will) that acts like the wick on a propane lantern giving the plasma shape and solid surface as it becomes inflated by your propellant system. maybe when you turn it off have a small vacuum inhale the "sock" back into the handle when deactivated. not sure what materials would work but my education was a sad joke so im sure you could think of something. that 1 u get free for 2 reasons. 1: you have the resources to actually build it. i dont.. 2: u gave that kid an arm. do more shit like that. and not for likes.
Please re stock the $49.00 one, I needdddd ittttt : )
I got one of these as a Christmas present for my family and it’s we all love it
How are they holding the flame so close to their faces?
I got the special white one, and got it for Christmas it’s amazing
Sorry about this comment but the version off this video in portuguese is litle bit shit xD
Alright no lie, just got it for Christmas, and This is without a doubt the coolest thing I own, I was worried it would just feel like an over glorified lighter but it makes me feel like I want to take down an empire and learn the ways of a magical telekinetic power from an old muppet. From the metallic design to the green flame(thought I would be blue first oh my god it was epic seeing it was green out the box) and a token that says I have helped in the development of the world’s first lightsaber… y’all keep up all the incredible things y’all are doing  as y’all really are turning movies and the dreams of being in those worlds into reality. Merry Christmas, may the force be with y’all, happy new year and all that jazz to everyone at hacksmith industries.
why has the military not sponserd you
So if I’m right, a clean room would handle liquid oxygen, a little bit easier, to put into the mini sabres?
Got it the other week, it's so cool, makes a great Life Day Gift
Ok if you’re trying to make a real size lightsaber then why don’t you make the mini light saber just bigger keep the design the same and then work from there
love the aperture reference on the equipment logos
9:49 POV: your sister’s makeup routine
Good news: the liquid oxygen can act as coolant  Bad news: it’s liquid oxygen
🤯
Look at those comment they clearly didnt see the whole project through. We dont got magical crystals that can amplify light up to instant melting temp. But even so it would take abit for heat to transfer. The plasma was meant to mimic the turning on and off function. Its also alot better than a heated beam of metal.
After they run out of fuel are you able to refuel them or is that it?
Where can I get that hydrogen generator ? @Hacksmith Industries
Can wait till the US army or British Royal engineers adopt there has standard issue as it be good to storm into a building that can’t be entered by “normal” means and can be used as a defensive/offensive weapon against the enemy and will destroy anything meat quickly so it be like a flamethrower but more close range
It definitely looks cool, but where are we supposed to get the fuel to reignite the mini sabers once they run out and how do we refuel them once we get the fuel?
Yeah... Gen Z isn't ready for real-size Lightsabers
I’m still waiting on you to finish the exoskeleton
The Giga saber moment had me dieing
Way more amazing than I expected. Just got my gen2 Today. Great job guys
I would love when you finalliy ditch the open flame lightsaber and go for the plasma field surrounding a rod so you can actually fight with it.
Just bought myself a Gen 2 dark side I can't wait till it gets here
Since you have a clean room, are making microchips any time soon?😂
Are you gonna restock?
Ohhhhh I can't wait for my next deployment, the Geneva conventions about to get some updates   FIX MINI SABRES!!!!!
the back to the future 2 reference tho
Hacksmith industries around the world
lightsaber without the sab
Cant wait till were in space
I bought one and It's definitely a good purchase, and I don't regret buying it
🌅
THEY'RE AVERAGE!!! Right?😢
How does a YouTuber get this much funding???
My dad came up with an idea that it could POSSIBLY save lives, by helping someone who is stranded in a car accident, and burn whatever piece or part that is causing the person to become stuck in a collision if they survive. He also coined a new term phrase that a light saber could be a “life saver.”
Are you all selling any of those lighters with the clear flame?
Bro imagine a stun blaster after the mini saber
0:15 yyyeeah, not gonna but that 😂😂😂. Not only is it expensive, but the sheer POWER these big ones have is by far enough to kill me by accidents.
Are they legal in every country? I live in germany and im not over 18 and im scared that i could get in trouble if i buy this
Don’t you think theyre a little stubby
Mans spent 3 years making lighsaber shaped propane torches
I can’t wait to see what happens 10 years from now
Hey, you should make shoes that can let you do that thing that neo does to dodge bullets in the matrix, Or make a mod for a nerfgun or airsoft gun that shoots slow enough to give the effect that you can see it and dodge it like in the matrixs.
Id say that’s a perfectly average size lightsaber
11:32 i thought James P. Sullivan was gonna walk through my closet door 😂
I remember watching u when u just started YouTube when you’re at like 100K subscribers, congratulations man you came along way.
how to fill them?
the best part is taht nobody can stop you. what are they gonna do? take away your lightsabers that operate at 4,000 degrees and can cut through LITERAL STEEL? yeah i don't think so
Cool
I bought one of the two saber kits for a gift a while ago for an xmas gift, they have not even shipped it yet , do not expect the store to send you anything in the time frame they tell you even when they assured me it was in stock
Just imagine ur being robbed and you then pull out a whole working hack smith lightsaber-
Just supersize a mini saber
Could you refill it at home?
well I'm definitely buying one
Que mierda pasa con el audio en español latino????? Es muy bizarro
Friend
Are those things legal worldwide?
Balls
Meu Deus, o que tá acontecendo com a dublagem por aqui?
Dear Hacksmith Industries, If I buy the hacksmith mini-saber, will I be able to pick it up here in Sweden or do I have to travel to Canada in order to pick it up?
Hello, I just thought that it would be incredible to be able to test your creations on the iconic faces of the characters. I will give 2 examples that come to mind, but the list could be much longer. It would be crazy to see Robert Downey Junior test your iron-man project or even Marc Hamill your lightsaber...  Just to see what it's like to actually have functional equipment and especially in reality and not through special effects.
What Training did you do? Or abi,...
What is this Name on the 3d Programm in 6.50min
Mine arrived today!!!! Shipping is strange, went from Ontario to Cincinnati, then to somewhere in Germany, then to the uk 😊
👍
james i dont know if you will find this comment but i have and idea for you since you have already built a hologram desk like tony starks why not build a fabricator the one the peter uses in spider man Spider man no way home and far from home
So happy for you
Would these even be able to interact with another sabers like in a sword fight? They’d just go right through each other right?
Another use would be lighting campfires.
It's amazing how fare he's come. A legendary smith to be remembered for the ages. I'm honored to be apart of your subscriber group 🙏
*Hey bro got a lighter...?*
When y’all making the omnitrix
Can you make the thought translator dog collar from the movie up
Frak yes!
Is this shippable to the US? I just tried buying one but it keeps denying my card and I’m assuming it’s because I’m using American money  Edit: nevermind i just couldn’t use Apple Pay for some reason, can’t wait for it to ship
hi hacksmith amazing video lik always Ihave an idea how to start of your iron man armor use titanium and then use the other part you have already built
Hacksmiths:makes a lightsaber The government:🙂
How many inches is the frame?
I was told it was average sized 😢
And whats the different to a lighter from AliExpress?
2:05 BOGDAN,HOW MUCH DID U USE M8,SHEEEEESH,UR GONNA BLOW A HOLE IN THE EARTH AT THIS RATE
Can you make it bigger i think if you can have a real size one
Another epic lightsaber
WTF???? Por que el video esta traducido al español en tiempo real?
I sure hope you are getting patent protection for your invention.
I want one 😃👍🏾
Can you make totorial on what the best ways are to charge them?
are you guys planning to sell the normal sized light sabers aswell in the future?
Love the Haperture logo
at around the 15:49 second mark you show a solar powered hydrogen generator and fuel cell combo, i was wondering who makes that.
Did you guys sell arc reactor... please...?
Hello,can you please make the grappling glove that Rico Rodriquez wears in Just Cause.
Have you considered using liquid nitrous oxide as the oxidiser?
I have a question, if you can use liquid oxygen in these mini sabers, why can't you use it in normal sized saber. I don't know really anything about this stuff so please don't attack me
Love the LTT Screwdriver shoutout. You guys should partner with them to put it on the store!
The Mega Saber, the one too big, you really don't want to drop it 💀
Hey so I really want to buy a mini-saber but when I had a look you guys are not able to ship them to Australia and I was just wondering why that's the reason?
I want to see solid blads
A little late to the party on this video, but I gotta say, this was probably the most metal Hannukah ever thanks to Hacksmith Industries. I love the mini-saber, it is genuinely one of the cooler gadgets I own.
Love the back to the future reference at the start!
The commenters complaining that it’s a “glorified plasma cutter” because it can’t cut through any material instantaneously are so mindless. It’s like they just expect you guys to invent whatever material a kyber crystal is made out of and use the force to put together a lightsaber that defies the laws of thermodynamics.   The fact that you guys can even get a “glorified plasma cutter” to emit in the near exact same shape and length of the lightsabers we’ve previously only seen as special effects in movies is mindblowing enough on its own.
This is so cool, but I wonder how this isn't gonna cause a fire or death or something with how dangerous these probably are
Apparently Im the only one amazed by the fact of both, the DHL guy and James, going in and out from the building in tshirt and short pants while freezing cold weather 🥶🥶🥶
Yeah but is it good for dabs?
No to the hair, yes to the toy. :)
make a stormtrooper electric baton i think that will be cool
This is cool and all, but so long as the "blades" pass through each other instead of binding and repelling each other, it isn't a lightsaber.
I don’t know if you could see the invasion of privacy the Green Brothers have been doing over the Years, but if you can, I need to see the evidence.  I found some person selling stuff on eBay with my identity on it and that is incredibly wrong. No one is allowed to buy anything of my identity or medical history and that’s not meant to be monetized.  If you can see, I need to see the evidence in order to charge them. I already went to eBay and flagged it multiple times but nothing happened. I don’t know what else to do. I know there is more to it than just that
Can I know your educational qualification sir?
Hacksmith running dry on new ideas.. so revisit old and perfect then. Not throwing shade, it's smart and makes sense
Hey ma! Look it's me at 5:28
please will look back on this video as beginning of light saber violence in the world
cool cool, now you should totally make a fully functional springlock suite from fnaf 😂
Making a Hyperloop train
No offense the mega saber looks like a flaw thrower with some extras on the outside
Man I feel like there are going to be a lot of technological advancements in the coming decades that will have been based or inspired by you're guy's work with the lightsaber. Like how star trek's communicators inspired people to make cell phones
Im a fan from india and i will try to buy your mini saber i appreciate your work
You guys should make spider man's under arm web wings
Can u please try water Powerd engine .. which uses water as fuel ... I bet if u do that CIA and FBI will be at ur roof top 😅
Am I too late for the discounts? I used the links in the description but it's full price.
I watched the whole thing but I might have missed it, With the Mini sabers does it run on fuel or something, do we charge it, how do we replace the thing, surely it's not unlimited.
Pls make a star wars Droid with real A.I that walks or rolls and talks in its own language!
So is it not essentially a big cigar lighter?
I Want to See You Build a Freezeray to Freeze The Planet from Space to Plunge The Planet Into Another Global Iceage as Big as We Want.
I am very impressed and im even about to buy one right now, however I want to know how dangerous it is, Im not expecting it to be safe, but i also dont want it to be super super super strong.
U could make a sonic screwdrive
What will happen if u just make the mini saber bigger ?
After the proto saber, you got the proto firebat. " Need a light?"
I’m been watching your videos since I was in the fifth grade. You guys are a big part of the reason I want to become an engineer. I am currently in the 12th grade. Your project are truly inspiring. I really did want to buy a mini-saber but I live in India and the shipping cost is too much. Thank you
why can't I purchase from Australia?
Wow colored torches 😮
Hey i have a question. In the far future, is it a possibility for a retractable tangible blade so that not only can it cut through stuff, but lightsaber duels can occur as well?
How are you accountable? What certification checks have approved you? You are literally supplying hazardous blowtorches that everyone can carry around.. like guns wernt enough in your country? So if a kid takes one to school and decides to shove it into his rivals eye you promise to shut down your operation and spend 50 years in jail?
wow you are selling lighter and saying it's good for kids 😂😂😂😂😂
I am planning to get one for my best friend he’s a huge Star Wars fan and he also likes playing with fire a little bit so it works well for him and I would love to get one as well even though I’m not a Star Wars fan I do love light sabers but the reasonable adult in this house would not let me
You guys DON'T make light sabers. You make everything BUT light sabers. All you've made so far is a carbon rod that glowed and a bunch of oversized cigarette lighters. To bad you can't focus your energy on something meaningful!
Megatrons fusion cannon?
pinn mee pls!!
Make tge canon that shot at hose to put light on it from the grinch movie
after all the hype with the flipper zero, a new and real Doctor Who Sonic Screwdriver seems REALLY realistic
Are they not available for Australia ?
this is cool and all, but your literally giving people extremely deadly weapons and advertising them as toys
@hacksmith do you happen to have a video on how you did the cloudlight for the hidden sleep room?
A mini lightsaber would be an interesting weapon to carry around.
I just received mine yesterday. The mini-saber gen 2 is probably the coolest thing i own now and i genuinely cant get over how awesome it is. My life is complete now that ive joined the dark side
So basically fancy and overpriced storm lighters
YAY
Good job. You just sold a weapon to kids
How has George Lucas not contacted you? And how the hell have you avoided Disney’s wrath 😅
Use plutonium
This i just a very good lighter
I absolutely adore how they made "Hacksmith Laboratories" look like the aperture science logo!
you guys are what happens when sheldon gets his hands on government money. 😂
I got my mini saber and it is my best purchase of 2023 ❤
That's maybe not a lightsaber yet but a fine light knife product :P
Make the Doctor who Sonic Screwdriver Next
Just got my ifixit branded one. Love it
Love that portal reference
The Star Wars fans are going to be so excited
Someone know if they are legal in Europe ?
I know it's obviously rarer but now with that dark mini saber I'm almost regretting buying the white preorder one
Light dagers, this is awesome :D
One day, the humanity and well-trained ai robots made a real lightsaber. I believe in that
You guys should make a tron bike
Cool product but the shipping is horrible.  I ordered one 5 days ago with fast shipping and it still hasnt shipped yet.  Reached out to them and got an automated response saying i might get a reply in a few days.  Definitely dont expect this by Christmas smh.
I have to get one. I need to be a part of this tools developmental funding. America started a space force. We need weapons to work in zero atmosphere environments
May the force be with you my friends.
would you guys ever make a gundam beamsaber variant?
hey can you try to make a spaceship?
I think the stuff y’all make is super cool, but I was wondering if it would be possible to include write ups for your videos.  I don’t know how to put this other than that I can’t stand being treated like I have the attention span and educational background of an 8 year old. I’m completely understanding of the fact that I’m not the target audience, but I really would like to be able to learn about the stuff y’all do regardless.  It’s a big ask, I know.
Hey idea for a lightsaber 2-3 versions from now - start integrating the gas nozzle version with the heated tungsten rod, and work on making the rod retractable. Will need electrical power in addition to the gas, but might need to flow less gas for the same heat? Definitely a challenge to make it reliably retractable and still heat though, maybe impossible.
you should make a real boatmobile out of a c3 corvette
Someday this guy is gonna fiqure out how to create the force irl
I love how you used Aperture for the Clean Room Hacksmith laboratories logo.
14:52 Why am I not surprised that Hacksmith does this 😂
imagine lighting a cigar with a mini saber lol
James have you thought or wondered about trying to make something that would use inertia as potential energy? Considering the Einstein's equation  E=mc2 , Potential energy and inertia are related to that equation. Just speaking theoretically do you think there could be possiblity of Inertial Hammer from Warhammer 40k becoming reality?  description of said weapon is:  inertial hammer is surrounded by what are thought to be power cables and the esoteric engines that drive the device. When swung, the head seems to gather inertial energy exponentially, so the weapon seems lighter and swings more easily the further it moves. On impact, the inertia is transformed into kinetic energy, allowing a single strike to hit with such concussive force that it can rupture a tank hull.   Considering that could be possiblity of making it by using electromagnetic induction as a method for transferring inertia into energy upon impact. or using piezoelectric materials in hammer to convert the stress generated by impact into energy. All what I mentioned is just an concept, but perhaps reality?  Edit: As I mentioned all of this is just an concept, and my understanding of physics comes from various lectures and books so I am not sure of but confident in what I mentioned.
I tried to buy one and i am in australia and it got stoped at the border
Ppl saying this is a glorified lighter are also the ones pays $100’s for a glorified glow stick… at-least the flame retracts instead of having a huge pole always sticking out
Cool 😎🤩 The mini-Saber shots at 16:41 look awesome, like an Al generated wallpaper
Offtopic project idea: create a Starcraft Carrier designed zeppelin/balloon. (including LEDs for nice light effects and custom drones designed like Carrier Interceptors)
Lol, it's lighter
How much is the mini saber in the philippines
How do gen 2 saber backers claim the challenge coin?
I want two arc reactors free by you
Video was amazing, worth every second of watching 💯 low key think the mega saber is so badass 😂
It would be cool if they did something like the flame gleeok blade using some sort of trigger on the handle with a gas canister or something in the handle so the flame comes out when you swing it
So, in the end, a real life actual proto saber will have : 1.A fuel source that burns to heat something 2. Something that is light but can also heat up whilst still maintaining rigidity 3. A cutting edge to help the super heated metal cut Basically becomes a heat sword lol
100$ lighter
Any one else notice the back to the future reference
How long does this product last? And when it runs out of fuel how do I get more. I do t want to spend 100 bucks on something that I have to constantly spend money refueling it.
I ordered one today can’t wait for it to arrive
I'd pay anything for you to make and sell s hidden blade from assassin's creed (preferably the one from ac 3)
Dangit! Why did this come up on my feed AFTER the discount period ended :(
The absolute monster dabs you could take w the mini saber lmao
These are incredible, but something I’ve noticed is that these are more of a flame, while  actual lightsaber blades are in some way solid.  That’s how they work in a duel and can deflect stuff.  I don’t know if making something like that that still collapses and everything thing will ever be possible.  Being able to duel with them would be awesome.
A mini saver gen 2 and Shipped to the UK for just over 100quid! Wow, soon as I get some cash I'm buying one
I got my mini saber pre-ordered a LOOOOONGG time ago, finally came and it beat out my expectations.
london just got an upgrade
Mine is awesome, thank you Hacksmith
Does anyone know if the mini saber is legal in Europe/ the Netherlands? Cus I want to buy one so bad. But I don’t want it to be at the borderline security if I buy one!
Please guys…don’t use it for violence🙏
Imagine bringing this Lightsaber mini on a camping trip to light the campfire.
Brother it seems to me like uve made the ultimate meth tourch
sounds completely safe
Anthony's actually the world's largest blowtorches rather than the smallest lightsabers
😭 I was so excited when I saw the hydrogen powered lighter. And then disappointed lol
7:09 why did he say to call 911?
2:32 if you want to watch that video look up NASA Rupture SLS Megarocket Fuel Tank
this guy heard someone say, "fine I'll do it myself!". and then made it his creed.
Hmm... so is the new 1 gonna be just as easy to refill the tank with liquid oxygen as the current ones are to refill with butane? 🤔🤨😳🥺
I believe that if Bogdan would born in Marvel/DC world he totally would be a genius scientist.
I wonder what George Lucas would think about this. This is awesome 👏
Cute, a super lighter
“We will cut that out”   They in fact, did not cut it out.
Make a purple colour changer for the mini saber gen 2 that will be awesome I will be the first to buy it 🙏👍🏻
[Crocodile Dundee - being robbed by a mini saber] "Quick, give him the wallet!" "What for" "Hes got a lightsaber." "That's not a lightsaber. THAT'S  a lightsaber"
This happened 4 years ago and they convinced me that Jesus and  God are the same being
Dear Santa...
Pleaase i need turkish translate pleasee😢
Arsonist's will love this
"But your kids are going to love them". :) Are you kidding?  Kids with potentially lethal mini lightsaber ?
Selling lighter sabers to fund a project is a work of a genius.   Meanwhile some customers were happily lighting up camping woods and even cigarettes for daily practical uses
Bro but it is like lighter
Gas to  liquid, the logical conclusion is something solid and dense, perhaps even crystaline in structure?
Hahahaha everytime he spoke of explosion or burning and it cut to a burning clip ..I laughed out loud
Love all of you, Appreciate what y'all are doing
It's really neat, but it's just a slightly OP lighter...
My family has been asking me what I want for christmas, thank you lol
probably good for dabs for real
I hear someone like hammers. How about the the Fallout 4 Super Sledge? Could be interesting.
Exciting!
My guess is the more irritating problem ya face in your clean room is your skin shedding so much, how did they get around that?
Could you use a different oxidizer?
wow
Nice diy Tutorial
nice jet lighter dude! good job that ones going on the refrigerator
Wtf that's a dagger not a sword, is this guy going broke? He bought a huge place then his subs slowed than to almost a halt
*Sigh* (Grabs wallet)
Ok, who's gonna tell them fire is not light?
Mobile viewer here: having the "Pew!" SFX at the very start of the video makes for a hilarious "toy" if you keep tapping the left side of your phone (to rewind). It sounds like James is deflecting blaster fire.
Can you make a real steel robot
I'm a fan from the Philippines, I've been following this channel since you created a Kings men umbrella. You guys are amazing, making the impossible to possible. keep it up!
It's the not that small. It looks average to me, I'm sure it has a great personality.
love it but it doesn't look like an actual light saber the tungsten one looked sm better ik it isn't retractable but it looked like a light saber
With every video you get closer to aperture science
Am sad I didnt find this out when it was first announced....Im def going to order one of these now
Please for the love of yoda don't buy these for your kids thinking it's a lightsaber toy🤦
Your kids are gonna love them 😂😂😂
Make the doom bfg  next
don't call them lightsabers bud 🤦‍♂
Wow! I used to set up those projectors for conventions back before Covid when I was a stagehand.
Engineering prowess at its finest. Legendary. ❤️
just a fancy lighter, i will only buy the real thing if Hacksmith manages to create it
$100 BUTANE LIGHTER, no liquid oxygen involved. These guys are confirmed scammers.
One straightforward question: Is the fuel butane or liquid oxygen? Because you state liquid oxygen but seem to be selling simple butane. I call bs bs bs. $100 common butane lighter, scamming you as a liquid oxygen lightsaber. SCAM.
Haha they got nicer clean room than all our clean rooms when I worked at Sierra space
Oh boy yeah souped up butane lighter. Can't wait to go through $5 cans of butane within a minute showing my friends how much of a dork I am.
So cool dude 😎
Yeah I’ll be taking dabs with one of those.
Can we get a build vid of that hydrogen generator?  super cool
Can you do the mini saber v1 disassembly? Cant find anywhere to disassembled without breaking .
Excuse me?       Giga saber? 😮
I remember as an elementary school kid watching you guys in awe back in 2016 sad that I didn't have an account or money and therefor couldn't like videos or show any support, and being so happy in 2018 when I could like your videos. Now I'm nearing adulthood and about to get my first job, I'm so happy that Hacksmith Industries is as big as it is now and that I could grow up along this amazing channel. Keep up the good work guys! 😊
I didn't get a signed one 😭
its the actual evolution proto sabers the pikes then real lightsabers
Great vid
You should send 1 to Marques brownies to do a review
quick question how do you refill the lightsaber and is it easy to do so?
Cool
Does the room actually have a door or does it just have those flaps?
The fusion Saber sounds very interesting.
Love the aperture labs reference! My favourite game series ever. I’m only here to see some cool flame stuff didn’t expect to see my favourite piece of media out there! Haha cracking job lads.
Damn, i think i missed the 25% off, i would have bought a dark saber and a stealth cap :(
Two words: Wrist Attachment
definitely gonna buy one
Glorified lighter
Hola *****
Oka
Dude the materials on that mini saber must be excellent, imagine the heat on the nozzle
Interesting
Just purchased mine! All the way from Panama 🇵🇦 wish the whole team responsible could sign it though. Amazing job 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻 if you guys ever come down to Panama, give us a shout 🙌🏻
I feel like for the flashlight they should recreated hallway scene from Rouge one.
this is a legit question, can i light up a joint with it
This is incredible.
im sorry but that tool kit is not worth the additional $100...
i dont know man this flame looks like a regular lighter
Correct me if im wrong, but was that a BTTF quote at the beginning? "You guys arent ready for that yet, but your kids are gonna love them" 0:19 Regardless if it was or not, super cool video! The mini-sabers look awesome!! :D
These are way too dangerous to be for the public ngl
People are going to burn their houses down with these LoL!
But I don’t want a liquid oxygen tank built into me😫
do we get a %50 discount when you sell the real lightsabers if we get mini ones????
Perfect lighter for blazing fat bongs
Why do you change the thumbnail after it’s already been posted?
My meth addict neighbour just bought a minisaber. He says its the best investment he ever made in himself
I can’t wait for the day someone shanks me with a like saber and make a Star Wars reference
How do you refill / recharge one of the mini sabers?
Cooooool
We love you
"oh my eyes" -- yep def wear infrared invisible all color laser protection glasses or pits in eyes blindness etc.
These are the kind of adult toys we needed in this life
9:51 APERTURE SCIENCE
btw. because of how small hydrogen is, it can actually go through solid metal, that's why manufacturing elements for hydrogen storage is so expensive, metal has to be of specific crystal structure
I absolutely thought that footage was digital until I saw it say it was a robotic arm footage
anyone notice how the hacksmith logos inside the clean room kinda look like the old aperture logo from portal
Hey we have a lighter
Nice looking lighter
That's a light knife
I got a pre-order love it
Stoners are going to love this
for kids?
how can we have access to the guide that shows all the internals and how to fix it if we didn't buy the Ifixit guide but the gold version of it ?
We are really finna have working comparable to lore lightsabers in like less than a decade
Does anyone else fell like  the editing style fell off a bit? In my honest opinion, it feels a bit clickbaity.  I still like the projects  but its just not the same.
That delivery time tho 😮‍💨🤣
are the light sabers now just large lighters?
lol, that hydrogen-powered minisaber was unexpected.
Ps5 or lightsaber 🤔
can you please please please make an omnitrix if you do I will comment and like every video u post(can you pin this)
Make an rc hot air balloon
Maby one day they will use a solid fuel and save even more space. (of course that would be way more difficult and dangerous. )
I think a miniature saber would be more of a knife, a Light-Dagger, if you would.
But what if you run out of fuel??? Really want to know!
hello theHacksmithi was wondering if you could make something for me I'll pay for it and even do a video on it if you want but would you possibly be able the make the classic legends of Zelda shield out of metal with the full design on it and arm holsters?
Well... More a firesaber than a lightsaber 😊
AWESOME ❤😂😂😂😂❤😂😂😂
Been watching and enjoying your videos and inventions for quite a while and I'm honored that my first lightsaber is coming from u guys 😁
I wanted to buy a lightsaber, but it is a pipe bomb. Additional features perfect, I need one
So civilised!
This is just an explosions compilation at this point 😂
There's warning labels to not replace a serpentine belt on a car WHILE IT'S RUNNING.  This is an incredible project but will ultimately end in someone losing a hand.
Seems pretty big to me
these guys are one cave johnson away from being a real life aperture science
WHy do I get the feeling "Hacksmith Industries" will be the logo that the resistance will see when they are fighting the robot overlords?
Sounds like y’all should go a different route on lightsaber. Too many failure points.
Next they need to make the Bolters from 40K!
you just made so many meth smokers happy
Mf ima use that shit for my bong😂
More like a dagger or a knife
Frankly I think your R&D is going in the wrong direction when you SHOULD be looking for Kyber crystals!
Us kids are going to burn down the world
you should build the mk1 light cycle from the movie tron legacy
I don't think you should be allowed to call it a saber if it's just a big lighter.
Can you make some mini sabers with other hilt designs?
that hydrogen minisaber is the coolest thing ever. also incredibly dangerous because the flame is invisible, but hot damn do i want one!
Still can't cure cancer 🤦‍♂️
Can you make a harry potter wand that is like a tesla coil with the equipment in a back pack then sent to the wand were it will shoot out
This is more of a lighter than a saber
Alex Labs created the first real lightsaber a few years back using hydrogen.  i think the hacksmith is awesome but come on why is AlexLabs being done dirty like this
Just imagine 100 years from now soldiers using hacksmiths lightsaber to fight in the war😅
you should talk to NASA White sands test facility. they could teach you some oxygen hazard and oxygen cleaning classes, plus they do all sorts of testing there with LOx, LH2, and other fuels for fuel cells and rocket engines.
If you with your mouth confesses that Jesus is Lord & dead for are sins, and in your heart believe that God raised him from the died, then you will be saved.
im to poor😭
10:18 Why does the Halksmith logo look like Aperture Science?
Guess I found a New Bong lighter
Also does he know how to wear a mask?
Mabie there's a reason only force users can use them.
You should create the Lance Chainsaw Assault Rifle from Gears of War
For those wondering.  The DHL driver is wearing short sleeves and shorts in the snow because it was August when he started loading up all those orders.
Is it possible to get it in the EU?
It's the lightsaber cheese knife from Family Guy 😂
Too bad taxes to France are almost half the price of the mini-saber itself!!
mini lightsaber came out before a new movie from Strar wars
Didn't even realise you could lock the saber in the on position!
So happy to see you guys go from garage to H.E.R.C., also please don't forget about the ironman tech, can't wait to see you guys making a real frickin iron man suit
Bruh that is not a mini light saber that is a light dagger
The discount doesn’t really work, when I go to checkout the -$28.75 disappears
I'm calling it now. 5 -10 years from now the military is gonna buy out Hacksmith Industries for their lightsaber research
I pre-ordered my mini Saber  back in May it took 7 months  to  receive  but it was worth the  wait  I absolutely love it
We need a pride saber
Bro unboxes a new PS5 in every video😭😭
The perfect cigar is now possible to start
I folded and got one lol
I died laughing at #1. 🤣
The full size ones look really cool but those mini ones just look like blow torches 😐
Yikes guys! Sure this is very cool, but dang this can be very dangerous... please be careful. It will NOT be very cool if this new LO saber explodes in a kids hand...
Are the mini sabers sold out in Australia already?
Whilst i can change the store to AUD, all I can then see is the color changing inserts. I cannot purchase one unfortunatly.
Now I kinda wish there were a clear one 😅  Very cool guys. Can’t wait to get mine 🤘💜
“Really difficult and dangerous to use”, as he waved around a hose pouring it out all around him…
I want the big lightsaber no lighter
I want mine autographed by Jess and Hailey.  But that's not an option
2:08 James being the miku pipe bomb meme
Are you sure if lightsabers being real is a good thing?
This is more than a premium screwdriver
Very very very interested let’s make reality realistic 😉
A sonic screwdriver lighter would be cool
Over priced ltt screw driver or light saber.... easy answer here
Blowtorches
Love the lightsabers, but i'm going to be honest it always annoys me when you use lightsaber sounds instead of just the sound of the saber. edit: also got annoyed at you saying oxygen was explosive. the oxygen is not explosive at all. the oxygen only *helps* explosions by giving them, well, oxygen. it sppeds stuff up.
The team at Hacksmith Industries actually do things that most people don’t even think of. It’s crazy 🤯.
When you click on the link it brings you to the full price item
It’s average
Plz do not make it limited as i am currently saving up as much as I can to buy one
How can we refuel the mini sabers
Make a double sided mini saber and I’ll buy it 😏
Hey just wanted to  bring this to your attention but i  saw someone basically selling your exact minisaber. i dont remember the website but wanted to bring it to your attention
Anyone remember that yt video with that guy that cut his finger off with a tiny lightsaber, it was coco and it was like 5 years ago or sum, now it’s become a reality
This just seems like an extremely bad idea... legal loopholes or not its a weapon.
I like in the UK. If I buy one what kind of fluid would do I have to buy to refill it?  Sorry I make jewelry for a living I have no idea about the tech side of life
pretty cool
You guys are awesome
mega saber???
use electrolysis to power the mini sabers with hydrogen and oxygen so all you need is to charge the battery and fill it with water
now just some how invent the force
Editor: how many explosions do you want in the vid? Hacksmith team: yes
This Is totally awesome
I understand buying things from creators to support them will cost more, but the first version of the small lightsabers are WIDELY available at HALF THE PRICE! And the colored ones are $100!!
the aperture science logos that say hacksmith are funny
is it just me or is that just a lighter? i see some big ones in truck stops all the time but those are the ones that have a gun style shape to them.
Your such a great youtuber
H.I. : World's smallest lightsaber!!!  BIC : hold my beer young padawan!
When I was a kid, I thought that Lightsabers would be essentially very strong electrics fields, using a high-current to literally turn the air into plasma. Liquid O2 is interesting and I am happy to see how far this has come over the years.
Hey, didn't really get how you enter the special discord? But I have one of the  preordered mini sabers
No matter the lightsaber….kenobi will always have the high ground🔥🔥
Yo Bog, what it like being the world’s leading authority on lightsaber science?
Once the lightsabers actually interlock when crossed, that´s when i call it a Lightsaber. Cool af anyway ngl
You guys are awesome!
Make a moonknight suit
They're average :(
The only reason I'm making this comment is so that more people can see this video, so that you can get more money, so that you can actually make lightsabers a reality
The tri-colour flame BLEW MY MIND 🤯
I smell Lawsuit
So the jist of this is don't hit a minisabre with a hammer.
I feel like all it needs now is sounds and you can call it a lightsaber or shoto saber (if I'm remembering that right) like the one Yoda uses. It's about the same size, just not the same length on the plasma
perfect for oil rigs lol ✌
it’s not small it’s average
You mean mini blow torches
Well... idk but thats... that's kinda average... I mean like come on...
okay but that drone switch was amazing
Einfach DHL Auto 😂
That’s wild that Hacksmith is essentially becoming its own cutting edge laboratory.
I can't wait to see more I wish I had the money right now. To get the red & black 1  I originally got myself the gold. 1  With two packs of the red color changers  But I gave it away. To make someone's day. That just got a cancer diagnosis. But hopefully someday soon. I'll be able to get the new ones. Someone that has bought one. They are amazing.  And Color packs actually lasts for quite a while.
Nice!
A lightsaber that lights things on fire?! Awesome! For kids?! No. Lol this will be good for cigar smokers maybe.
Are you legally allowed to call them Lightsabers? If Disney gives you trouble name them Hacksabers. You have my full blessing to use the name.  BTW, I love your store. It has no hidden BS fees that blow the prices to almost double, and it's in CAD for us Canadians. Thank you!
Not in Australia 😢
I wish i wouldn't have to pay 50 extra euros for shipping, tax and customs
3:22 and your selling it
you keep teasing that MK1 suit and man I wanna see it real, I wanna see the iron man suit built in a cave
So basically i can buy a couple of these, strap them to a cobra or sum, and create an effective pipe bomb? Seems dangerous
I'm sure someone has called this out before, but even though James' dream is to be Iron Man, he's slowly becoming Cave Johnson. Hacksmith Labs will soon be Aperture Science.
Jetpack Joyride
But if your putting liquid oxygen in the hilt, the hilt will need to be cryogenically cooled, unfortunately you can’t just make the tank wall super thick. You’ll need a big battery to keep it cool, you’ll only be able to keep it cordless for like 5 minutes. Can you explain how you’re planning to tackle this issue? So cool regardless.
0:21 just got that back to future reference lol
Me when I ask my dad to make a lightsaber   🥖💡
It's a gas electric hybrid flare
All I can say is good luck... Nobody wants to see real lightsabers more than me. But I can think of so many things stopping you from getting to the final product. I'm excited to see how you tackle them! :)
Isn't the alcohol cleaner the anycubic wash and cure 3? Or am i tweaking
Omg they did an invisible blade version. They are really going for Star Wars authenticity and I am living for this absolute nerd-am
Any interest in building a custom ball mill cylinder for a small Prospecting business in Utah.
You need a bigger warehouse
Id buy that
Imagine making the sonic srew driver
We'll have lightsabers sooner than later. I like that.
This dude's a legend 🗿🥂
I'd LOVE to see more about that hidrogen fueled version
Yooo any backstory of the guy at 9:14?
Sell the full things already man. None of this pocket knife UK crap
Dudes playing youtube tycoon
I got an iFixit Minisaber. Do i still get the coin ?
dude there's gotta be a better way than liquid oxygen
Wait wait wait. The Dark Edition is brand new in the last 24 hours?!?
The Gen 1 mini-saber looked so cool, why did they ruin it?  Having only just discovered this, I'd much rather have a Gen 1 than something which looks like a tacky toy.
I purchased the pre-order white version. How can I access the update videos?
Freaking SWEET. Although I shudder to think about the havoc people could get up to with one of these, but I hopefully the cool factor of just having one will outweigh any "sith instincts." And invisible flame that hot is scary. The Hydrogen "pop" in that demonstration practically singed my eyebrows watching at home.
What's next? The death note?!
Is the 25% discount finished? It doesn't mention anything when I click through YouTube. 130CAD.
Any and all reason to put so many explosions into one video
Is for me?    🥺  👉👈
for you  for all of us : )
The video is equal parts classic hacksmith video and 90s 15 minute infomercial, down to showing off wacky uses for the product
Isn't this just a fancy lighter?
£200 for a lighter 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Don’t drop them completely vertical though
I'm one of those people who saw hacksmith since they are just 10k subs, I can't believe how much they grow all these years, sadly i can't donate cause I'm broke but i can just give my undying supoort.
the hacksmith laboaratories sticker is a nice touch
clean room looks like a space station
Just a glorified torchlighter
I just watched a 15 minute informercial, and I'm not even mad
Oh my, you'd be appalled at the condition we find some projectors when we're maintaining cinemas, James! Makes a clean room seem like overkill! Hehe.
what are you planning to do about clasging lightsabers
i love the new super quick edits between bogdans speech😂😂
I dont know why i started cracking up when the big saber was pulled out 😂 but it just got better and better 😂😂
Light daggers.
make the oxigen solid so you can store more
Are you evolving in aperture science? When you will start working on teleportation? It will be funny if Hacksmith will be like black mesa or aperture science of our real world.
i like that for the "Hacksmith Laboratories" logo you have made the same design as the aperture science logo
Aww, they look so cool, but I don’t have money
Sorry, but it is 8$ jet lighter I’ve bought 3 years ago from China just in a different case that looks like a lightsaber. Cool business idea though.
I have to ask: is there a minimum age for having it?
Lmao make sure to NOT take any liability for peoples homes burning down, cause deadass scaling&manufacturing is wayyyy more difficult than just designing a lightsabre, which in and of itself isn't easy whatsoever
The Hacksmith logo in the clean room looks like the aperture science’s logo from portal. 08:27
Makes me wonder if they'll ever make something from Subnautica or other games...  PRAWN suit when?
yooo! Keep the good work up guys! Pretty impressive u guys made it this far! I give u my full support!
Make a dark saber
there is no shopping button for me
You guys're amazing.
Love the hexagonal tiles on your office wall James, I have the same design on my workbench!
To many lightsabers? Ain't no such thing.
Cant wait for the fully handheld one. Will there be a video coming soon for that?
It’s a lighter, nothing more, let me see you cut through more than 3 layers of tinfoil, the only difference is your wasting fuel to produce a bigger flame and adding copper to change the colour chill out
you cant have too many
Not the portal logo
Honestly, you just know someone, either a customer or employee, will at some point in time lose their hand to this...
I'm working in pharmaceutical, I'm the one who they ask to validate their Cleanrooms. So I full well know what you were talking about.   And I think you did a good job, by what I've seen.
Isn't this basically a more powerful jet lighter?
your lightsabers will be a fine addition to my collection
Can I have one?😅
9:13 is he eye ok he look horible something not good loking?
You guys are so amazing
Ok ok I buy now!
damn
I love how casually he said "let's play with liquid oxygen" immediately after telling us how dangerous it is. Exactly what I'd expect from a sci-engineering/infotainment channel.
We all know you have Bogdan chained up down in the basement licking envelopes and signing lightsabers. 🤣
a good enough reason to not buy a mini saber is that i don't have money for it...
Why are 100% of Romanians living in the US and Canada named Bogdan. Is it a requirement for citizenship or something?
Impreassive
where purple lightsabre
🐨
man it is too expensive
Im not sure if it is possible to do because of guiline but, I think a cool name for the mini lightsaber would be dagger saber.
FINALLY!  It comes in black!!!!  Definitely getting one now! (wasn't too crazy on the gold/brown, just why??).  Thanks so much!
Don't you mean too many blowtorches?
Bogdan is actually goated
I've noticed that you guyhs don't really twirl the sabers. Can they be turned upside down? You mentioned the cremebule part but if it's too dangerous to turn upside down then that wouldn't work.
This is where the fun begins
It's a lighter...
This is great! Cant wait to see what happens next. Keep up the awesome work!
Ur welcome
Can you deliver this mini light saber to pakistan to me
Just ordered my dark side light Saber.. so ready to annoy my wife with it
I truly admire your channel for its engineering ingenuity and credibility. You can see engineering past, present and future in your labs.
I wish I would get my founders edition. It's said shipped since 11/28, but still just says the label was created :(  (just emailed the hacksmith crew and hoping to hear back soon).
I just spent so much money
Where is the shelf? It’s not showing up! I tried with my phone, iPad and Pc, with the app and three different browsers.
It looks much more like a flamethrower than a lightsaber
I searched for 30 minutes I can't find the store on YouTube. Is it possible to find this store from Germany?
So the other videos were a stall for an epik vid!
This looks soooo dope
I have one of those mini sabers now. It's dope. Easily my coolest lighter.
Hello there Griveous
cool
Andrew Tate's new cigar lighter?
A Star Wars Intro pivoting on a Back to the Future quote, bald but it worked!
You guys are just insane 😱
You guys are awesome and are living the dream. So happy that you are allowing all us nerds this awesome experience, hope everything continues to go well!
2:31 liquid oxugen is so dangerous and explosive...he said thid WHILE IT WAS LEAKING
That subtle LTT store diss 😂
Bro is just building a rocket engine.
Fix your shipping problem to Australia. Customs has mine :(
Surely one can't have too many lightsabers. Just look at General Grievous
i need one of these ! can it smelt  gold
i need one of these ! can it smelt  gold
please let us in australia get the mini sabers too
We’re the second gen mini sabers not supposed to be signed? It says founders edition on my box. It’s fine if not but I’m slightly bummed now
The only questions I would have:  Are the Ifixit lightsabers for EU consumers shipped from Ifixit their EU warehouse?  How would warranty work, since in the EU there is a 2 year minimum mandatory warranty "By law"
I'm going to use the mini saber for anything that anybody could use a lighter for
send one to goodtimeswithscar
This is awesome, sadly can't at the moment afford one, but still will get one eventually, as been wanting one since the original announcement. Keep up the amazing work.
You'll become rich by all militaries!
Really cold huh? You know, somewhere in the star wars universe there is a kyber crystal that can make a blade that freezes stuff.
but for the clean rooms shouldn't be use double doors?
I hope you don’t plan to make weapons. Making gimmicky lighters is cool but don’t abuse your power here. The world does not need lore accurate lightsabers
ok but when is James completely becoming tony stark?
Flammable material sign in a dark room is like a "do not tocuh" sign in braille. Both will make the user say oh shi... However the first one might not allow the user to finish the phrase 😂
I love this channel!!🚀
For all of us
Sold out within hours, well done Hacksmith team!
my boy actually made a lightsaber cheese knife.
I like these guys but I feel like he’s always talking about money etc like other YouTubers who just as expensive things do it in a more classy way. He literally begs for money
My gold one just spits a huge flame 😭 sounds weird too, looks cool on the shelf tho
4:02  if that's the case use remote control arms just to be safe while testing
Ist crazy how far they came from a garage to a clean room and such more, the future will be be epic especially the future of the light saber
8:27 Hacksmith Industries is slowly becoming Aperture Laboratories. Absolutly insane. Hopefully you don't start with human experiments😉
Bloody insane people!! This is so so so cool! And insane,,, and also kinda scary! Have fun y’all! XD
There is no such thing as too many lightabers. But if you need to get rid of a few jist call grievous. I hear he is a collector
Realistic? Yes. Functional? Not really. I feel like to mimic the dueling function you'd have to make a retractable but durable pole in the center where the flame can round off on the top (unless you want that unstable Kylo Ren look). I do think what y'all are doing is cool though!
I ordered a MK1 saber and it came yesterday just before this went live. Over the moon and LOVED the challenge coin. On to buying the MK2!
Hohoholy shit! Proud to be in the same country as you, my dudes. I salute you.
I like the effort you guys spend in this, and I like the technology behind it. But I'm not a Star Wars fan, I actually don't even like it. So no saber-kind for me.   But eh.. How about some Star Trek tools? I would really like a TNG/Voyager combadge with smarthome features.
The Hacksmith just Looney Tooned himself. 🤣🔥 💥 ☠️
Maybe you can make a double sided lightsaber so  it can store fuel and make it in the hilt.
I'm def taking a dab with the mini saber
man who the new editor, kinda like em
They bouta cook meth next
rippin a dab with a red flame
i am so sad that you guys cant ship to australia :( was gonna buy some for people for christmas haha
You do not make anything anymore.. It's your team that does. Perhaps the cons of becoming big
Good luck and don't Explod😅
It's oddly well suited that you're sponsored by Youtube since the video feels like it spends more time pandering than entertaining
Just got 2 mini-sabers !!!! So excited
So its an expensive lighter
Is it just me or the Hacksmith Laboratories logo looks similar to Aperture Laboratories in the game Portal?
from intern to lightsaber rocket scientist clean room schematic theorist is truly incredible.
Hello i'm from cratia
I'm sooo happy and proud of you all at Hacksmith.  Very happy I got to back you guys by getting a white mini gen 2. 😊 Thx from WI
The "Mini-Saber" is just a rebranded gas station lighter, I got one for $22...it fell apart after about 4 months of using it regularly for...."Soldering"...
👌
The true purpose of the hacksmith
Make no mistake! These guys actually DON'T build a SuperCleanRoom lvl 100 They already building the engine for their very own Razor Crest! The not-so-subtle clues for my claim are among their videos...
You should make 40K stuff irl
Love how the logo is a version of Aperture laboratories. Wheres the shower curtains. Real portals are next.
Can you ship to Australia yet or are the customs guys still being rude about it?
If you are in Australia you cannot buy these Mini-Sabers as they will be seized by Border Patrol. You have been warned. 👍
Damn, all out of Pocket Refs. Kinda wanted to pickup 2.
It’s just a high gas lighter?
But if you fight another saber dont they just pass through each other
7:50  0.0005mm is not small it's average 🥲
I’m so glad you came back and refueled long live nerds and hard work and always remember the true ogs who pushed you knowing you can do it and create awesomeness.
I love the fact that you went so over the top for what could’ve been said in a 30 second commercial
🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪
I can't get the mini saber because I live in asia
Could you make a new hilt design
Real shame Australia cant get these they look cool as heck!!
Idea: make a Fatman from fallout
Wow are you living the dream ! Its amazing how far youve come , from backflip tutorials to exoskeleton to avengers to now lightsabers !  Ive been watching you guys almost from more than 5 years and it is insane just to see what the hacksmith industry has become ❤  Ive become so interested in machines and building and engineering all becauae of you , you and your team are literally living my dream job and dream life at the same time 😂 and it is so cool to be a part of this amazing part of history   Thank you for everything dude ❤
What do you mean it’s mini? I‘d say it’s gigantic
5,000 BTU is a nothing this product is a scam
Mini saber 2 ordered.  Off we go into mayhem.
"I doubt there will be another sale like this" 😂
ordered.
"you guys aren't ready for that but your kids are going to love" it really took me back.... TO THE FUTURE
That hydrogen powered mini saber was incredible I love that one
I feel like I’m watching a presentation… I love it!!
How far the hacksmith came is mind blowing While watched you earlier you were just making Marvel items in real life and then a destroying stuff montage Now , the hacksmith is like an industry Too happy for you my man Keep going
How do you refill it?
I'm trying to think if any other youtubers have a cleanroom. I think the Thought Emporium's biolab isn't actually a cleanroom, but a room that is clean, and that has a laminar flow HEPA filter flow-hood for actually working on samples. There's really no one else that comes close that I can think of (there may be others).
I have an Idea! what if you replace the liquid O2 with kyber crystals?!
Still haven’t got my saber and they’ve already made a G I G A S A B E R
Do you have a solution for european (french) custumers ?
WARNING!!, do not buy one if you live in Australia because it will be seized by the Australian Border Force  and disposed of.
Sabers are awesome <333
I don't know if anyone will read this but. A pal of mine burned to death whilst working on an oxegen plant. The investigation found there was a tiny leak in the chamber and his clothing became oxegen saturated and hyper flammable. A spark set fire to his clothing and he died in hospital a few days later. Be very careful guys.
If you guys keep going soon you will be experimenting with magnetically confined plasma.
Now put uranium core to shoot neutrons up and high voltage electron beam  up to create deuterium that will burn.
do they hurt people?
Who may thing that making game weapons into real thing, can work this good :D
The things you guys do on YouTube is awesome. I’ve been watching since the earlier lightsaber videos and every advancement blows my mind. Can’t wait to see what comes next and might just have to grab one of those mini sabers!
is there a lightsaber for australia? im tryna buy one but i cant see it
bro really went from garage tomfoolery to a lab
Can I use it to take a dab tho?
WOW !!! CONGRATS >>I`m sharing this
that was a cool ass challenge coin, how can I get one
Can you still buy the gen 1 lightsaber? I think it looks way cooler.
Bro property waisted 10000 euro's of hydroxiden oxygen while explaining 😂😂😂
Shipment country choice is very limited 🥲
man you gotta send one of these to star wars theory
Did not expect a back to the future reference in a lightsaber video, but nerds do be nerds
This thumbnail is … unsettling
glad to see you got the support! can't wait for the full light saber to be finished!
We've is come so far with expandable batons... and I remember your initial test using fire proof material with induction. Ideally I guess I'm just imagining a modern expandable baton with a bunch of vent holes for fire.
So how dangerous would it be for someone to attempt to disassemble it and experiment with it? Cause someone will do that.
İ laughed so hard that i killed my brother 😂😂 12:35
dunno why but the overall vibe of your videos has really settled into something fun and inspirational. Maybe you're less stressed now or something, but it feels relaxed like hanging out with cool friends.
Send one to Andrew Tate
I’m not smart
Are there any plans to make a glow-in-the dark mini saber?
8:28 it seems everyone likes Portal!
no shelf with and without adblocker
the moment i have money i will buy
Love my white mini saber, unfortunate that it was apart of the batch that did not get the extra glowing tips though
4,500 degrees???  They'd be lighting shit on fire from like 3 feet away.
This is crazy!! Super cool. I love my mini saver
That LTT burn. I see what you did there...
FUCK, I just bought one 2 days ago.
This would be dope if you involve Michio Kaku
drop shipped bs
Best hacksmith video ever!!
I was kind of horrified at first thinking that you are selling your steel cutting lightsaber. I was like how is that even legal. But now Im really relieved (although a bit disappointed) that what you sold is basically a cool ass looking lighter
Where are the bunny-ears on your guy’s Bunny Suits? We want to see bunny-ears! 🐰
Pipe Bomb , So cool
Basically lighter on steroids
Amazing
Jesus man, hacksmith has become such a sellout for their stuff. I completely understand that you need to fund what you're doing. And i also agree that you should show off the stuff you are trying to sell. But over half of this video is trying to sell your mini saber. I just wanted to throw my thought into the mix of this video. I'm not a hater by any means, but i beg you guys to tone that down a bit. Please don't go down this path.
We got real lightsavers before gta 6
y'all need to calm down the meme editing. It is very distracting and annoying past a certain point(And you definitely passed that point in this video)
Shipping guy got one lol that's great
It's quite cool to see Star wars happening in reality but like what Samuel Jackson said. "Does it come in purple?" And it'll be really cool to see the blasters from star wars too but it does seem really hard to do
Nice thumbnail
As a starwars nerd i love this! all we need is to conquer intergalactic travel!
Can i get 1 for free
Next is solid hydrogen, aka kayber crystals!
Can definitely use the mini sabers for heating up a dab
What does it take for you guys to make Shadow’s shoes?
You guys aren't ready for that but you're kids are going to love it 😭 Imma go 88 miles an hour and stop myself from hearing that JK I love you guys
Lightdagger looks dope NGL
Hmm. Isn't this just a lawsuit in the making? Disney owns the Star wars IP. Won't they just wait until you've made enough money and then sue you for all damages and money you made from the product?
How do you get the white mini saber? I didn't see it in the store
chodesabers fr
4:57  Based Techno Merch enjoyer.
I really hope a future version has a telescoping core that will extend under the pressure of the burning gas and can withstand the temperature for longer than the gas tank can last. But also auto withdrawal without the gas to keep it extended. (Even if the withdrawal method is only gravity requiring you to turn it off vertically for the effect.)  If I’m not clear on this post… look up Michio Kaku’s breakdown on how a real lightsaber would work.
I just received my white founders lightsaber. Beautiful piece of engineering!  Keep up the hard work fellas and may the force be with you💚
Shit wrong time to loose my job 🤔 Double motivation unlock 😂😂😂
Edit:  I don't subscribe to many channels on Youtube because I don't find them worth my time, but I've been a fan of your videos since you started out making the Wolverine claws about a decade ago.  This is definitely my favorite channel.  I love Bogden saying that liquid oxygen is super expensive, while letting a container of oxygen bleed out.  Also, the only downside of these things is that you don't get the classic hum of the saber, but rather a hiss sound.
How far away are you guys from shipping to Australia
here kids, play with fire.
I got mine a few weeks ago. I have some feedback, if the base gets twisted in some ways, the locking mechanism can fail (not lock), if you put it in and out of the original packaging a few times twisting back and forth to get it out, you might encounter that too. Second, the adjustment ring is lacking range, the flame is way go much to do heat shrink work with it, I need to be able to throttle down more.
Still waiting for one with a rod in the middle of the flame so it can actually "collide" with solid objects.
احسنت
what nowadays looks like steampunk science for this kind of lightsaber, serves as the foundation for what can come out of it given 50 to 150 years in the future. just imagine what can happen with better tech. so you deserve all the love and respect for being pioneers.
The giga saber is funny 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Nice! A lighter! Zou want how much?!
Hacksmith: We made a 1000 cleanroom.  Also Hacksmith: Walks into said cleanroom improperly wearing his chin-dipper.   smh. cover your nose or don't bother with the face mask.
Nose over the mask killed me.
was that an arizona sunshine reference
@thehacksmith, couldn't find the new version on the Australian website
You got sponsored by your boss effectively... skills I guess
I've been watching since the first sabre build and I love how despite how much the hacksmith video style has changed the quality hasn't dropped at all
Oh man Ive bought one a month ago...
why don't you guys just use kyber crystals?
Incredible progress. So glad this project is still moving forward.
Could you somehow make sabers resistant to each other via electromagnets?
THOSE ARE NOT LIGHTSABERS
Can it still arrive for Christmas in the US?
real lightsabers before gta6💀
just saw some products with the hacksmith's logo, and next to it was the aperture logo, possible portal related project in the future? turrets? Glados? Cores maybe?
Why don’t you get design, and build a specialized machine, to handle fabrication of the light savers, in a completely autonomous, vacuum environment; this would also work for other, pieces of technology that needed a clean room, or a sanitary room.
if you screwed up with that hydrogen one...
I want one but it’s to expensive 😢
I love your video and sorry I was late
So happy to be a part of the development of a real saber. My girlfriend is going to get tired of me lighting all her candles with my mini-saber and making all these sound effects 😂
Thank you hacksmith. Love my mini saber. Need the green insert to become yoda.
Hacksmith: "We're gonna live in a world where light sabers are real." Me: "Oh God no." Hacksmith: "There's more." Me: "No..."
No, here's my question if it still uses actual flames. Wouldn't it be able to actually burn somebody isn't? They would not be made for kids right
btw in case you don't already know someone stole your mini saber and are selling them and not giving you an credit for your design
I am gobsmacked on how they are able to afford all this? My company is also building a clean room and insane how much goes into making one. Seriously guys good job on all your success!
I don't comment very often but keep doing what your doing. Absolutely love yall!!!
I have absolutely no use for a lighter, but looking forward to your future products 😁😁
Dear Hacksmith, could you use liquid hydrogen instead of butane, thus compressing the design even more, even though it might be more dangerous? It may make it even more explosive and will be slightly harder to contain, but I believe it is possible!
THE LOOK ON YOUR FACE HACKSMITH ,REMINDS ME OFF ALL THEM TIMES I HAD BEEN CHEECKY  AND MY MA WHO IS ASIAN WOULD YELL AT FIRST THEN HAVE A LAUGH LATER, for example after, when family would come over karaoke nights, I would spend my time digging abt 1ft deep man hole booby traps a bunch of em , fill with water n mud etc cover with grass , n kick back watch a bunch of drunks trip over trying to get to the car , 😂😂😂😂 I'd cop smack here n there  but worth it 😊😊😅😅
I love the hacksmith videos, but at 2:20, oxygen liquifies at 90K, quite a bit above 0K.
Instead of using liquid oxygen how come you don't just skip a step and go straight to using a solid oxygen crystal it would be more correct you know a crystal energy source
I ordered one but customs seized it.😢 So you can't import in to Australia.
im onle 15 so I can't bay it  but I will bay it wan i have a god job
I love the subtle jab at linus. Though the ltt screwdriver is pretty dope as well
I wonder how safe this is? Wouldn't there be a high risk of somebody burning themselves @HacksmithIndustries ?
Isn’t this a cigar lighter
"Combusting with other materials ... like *metal*"
I wonder what the hydrogen one would look like with a colour changer?
theres more...
7:20 yah clean rooms are so cool I got to go on a trip to Boston and saw their clean room
7:10 Scottish
Wow! And that is a massive understatement! Can you use that super clean room to contract with the government to make other components? I am in Huntsville Alabama and those same rooms are used for the space industry for everything.
If I get it and run out of the gas, do I need to buy more?
i just realized watching this vid that i've been subscribed for 7 years to this channel. i remember being in college for engineering when you guys first put out applications for summer interns and thinking to myself that i would have applied if i was single at the time and wouldnt have to leave my then girlfriend in the one time of the year that we didnt have to be long distance. we ended up getting married though so no regrets, but it does feel weird knowing that i had an actual chance of being on this channel that i've somehow spent so long with. love the vids as always, it's amazing to see how far this channel has progressed in my time watching
How many times can you explode a Bogdan in a single video
I'd love to see @NileRed make a room like this.
That invisible hydrogen flame was kinda terrifying
ok that looks cool and all.... but can u fight with them?
It's all sold out!!!!!!!!! :(
I like stick light saber than flame saber
Next:  Phasers
Hacksmith: We release a mini lightsaber Me:So it's a lighter? Hacksmith: no! it's a mini lightsaber Me: but it has the same internal with fancy hosung? Hacksmith: Don't call it a lighter
Dude I just bought one and can't wait to get it
"OOPS, ALL SABERS"
I would, but I got taxed 47%of my pay, and I have rent, so maybe in a few weeks
12:30 are we not going to talk about how Hacksmith roasted and complimented linus channel all in one go XD
I cant wait for the new light saber design. It’s SOOOOOO much more accurate. Not only is it going to be the size of a light saber but it also explodes if you assemble it wrong just like a light saber form Star Wars. You guys are really make Star was real.
Anyone notice how the Hacksmith laboratorys logo looks suspiciously like the Aperture Science Logo?
overflag plasma​ saber pls.
A surprising amount of what we know about oxygen comes from the tragedy of Apollo One.
I can confirm they are really cool. Got mine last week
Ok if I could afford it that iFixit bundle would be an instabuy.
I think next you should create a starwars blaster.
3:30  To this point you've done nothing but convinced me how bad of an idea this is.
damn
I would kill for a mini dooku lightsaber hilt
What if they drop it vertically like in Rick and morty😭🤣
Not if you live in Australia 🥲
Wonder if they'll be able to make a full sized one at some point
the down side of being Aussie cant get a gen 2 mini saber dang it oh well still absolutely love the content maybe one day i shall be able to get on
you guys are insane
This is kinda like the catalytic lighter that my friends gifted me back in 2005
Legit Question: If I purchase the ifixit bundle (bc I love the colors) do I still get the coin and discord access?
Please let’s see the clip of the lightsaber in front of the hammer at night w the hammer lit by the worlds brightest flashlight
How food safe are the colored flames? Ex: marshmallow or creme brulee?
That’s a pretty neat laser kitchen.
It's not that I don't want a minisaber, or that is not worth it (it totally is) I just can't afford it 😢
Bro you know what would be cool is if you did the oasis from ready player one
I don’t think I’ve ever seen hydrogen burning completely colorless like that. That’s dope.
You forgot to sign my box, but other than that I can't stop picking up my gen 2 mini saber every time I pass it in the garage and using it as a pointer when I'm explaining something to a friend. Probably the best merchandise a YouTuber has ever made.
Okay. Fine. You guys win. I want to be part of the journey to creating real lightsabers.... so I bought one........ HAPPY????!
Would love to see a saberforge collab
I can see it now the mouse is just waiting for these guys to actually make a lightsaber so he can sweep in and sue the crap out of these poor guys. You have to watch out for the mouse he is a big-time mafia boss
Oh yes, liquid oxygen, the thing that makes rockets fly...    and explode like nukes.
It's so cool and amazing that we get to be a part of building a piece of history with you. Thanks for you and your team hard work and thanks for taking us along the way!❤❤
Hey Hacksmith, I have an idea. Why don't you try to make the color changing things look like kyber crystals? I'm sure you have though about that, but I'm just throwing it out there. I think it would make the mini-saber even more iconic, and it would really put the Star Wars feeling in there. Keep up the amazing work, you guys are so inspiring and part of the reason I go to a vocational high school!
no shelf with premium
Love this video. I also have no idea how you can afford to build a literal clean room and afford such a huge facility and staff off revenue from YouTube and sponsorships. Would love to learn about the economics of a company like this.
How much for a mega saber?
Glad your back making videos man! Hope youre doing better!
Not telling you your jobs, but wouldn't something like hi-test peroxide or a solid source of oxygen, like an oxygen candle, be much less incredibly dangerous than LOX? LOX is just so unfunny you should surely avoid it given any chance at all. You're aiming to sell these to the public, who aren't scientists and don't know their cryogenics or extreme oxidiser practice.
Wait will the saber run underwater. Or in a vacuum
You guys are my role models in making crazy things. Without y'all i wouldn't have been interested enough to learn so much about science.
What if I only have a PO box?
Remember to be extremely careful with liquid oxygen, it csn be just as dangerous as literal rocket fuel if handled incorrectly. Would be really sketched out about holding a metal tube with liquid oxygen in it tbh
heheheb
As a cigarette smoker who got in on the pre order I can whole heartedly endorse this product
I love the Aperture laboratories logo!
I say use a mix of Acetylene, Oxygen and a catalyst so that less fuel can be used by making the same amount of Acetylene run hotter. I suggest mixing the color into the gas, such as strontium sulfate, (SrO4) which might make an effective oxidant by being able to oxidize the acetylene and turn it dark red. I would like to remind you that the holy grail is a retractable lightsaber that runs hot and can be used for dueling. You might want to investigate an acoustic laser to modify the flame and create a field of air to repel other firesabers.
Just ordered my MiniSaber. :)
anyone else worried that this thing will explode
Sick
I want a beautiful Asian lady to gently guide me when I do something wrong...
If I didn’t already have my founders edition one I’d probably buy one, it’s to bad that they didn’t make a matte black one for the founders edition.
he he WHY
I could totally use the force for a dab rig 😤🤯
Already a backer, to buy the 2 new ones or not to buy, hmmm... Shame that the iFixit one needs me to rebuy the pro tool kit as that blue and black looks great.
This is so ridiculously dangerous. I hope y'all test it with a 10 foot pole
The chrome one is pretty cool
Maybe y'all can use metallic hydrogen as fuel someday :)
Been wanting one of these. Good things come to those who wait. Merry Christmas!
Y not UVC Sterilizing Diffusers & Devices for 100% clean room!?
I will FOREVER love you guys, watch every video, support yall, and im not saying i dont LOVE this. but its always been a slight pet peeve of mine where its called a lightsaber, and its just "flame", its not actually hard and dense n whatnot like a real lightsaber ya know? or easily "controllable". I only wanted to get that off my chest but not in a negative way! I want to buy one of these these haha and you guys are AMAZINGGG
I pre ordered it and I tried it this weekend I had so much fun.Even my dad wants one😅
I pre-ordered the limited white one, and received it a little while ago. I haven't filled it up yet 😅
And to think that all of this started with just a glowing metal rod
These will make an amazing Christmas gift! Bravo, James.
Damn. I wish I had the money to toss out on a mini saber. But instead I am saving up for that sweet ass steam deck.
I think you guys actually convinced me to buy it lmao
I wonder if you could make a plasma bottle type lightsaber if you had room tempeture super conductors. In fact if you are using liquid oxygen you don't need room tempeture super conductors do you. Just normal off the shelf super conductors will work for perhaps half an hour with liquid oxygen cooling.
I know no one will see this, but I just want to say how amazing you guys are. From your Garage to the H.E.R.C facility I've watched every video. I've forgotten how long or at what amount of people I subscribed to you guys at cause it was so long ago. But I want to thank you guys for everything you're doing, pushing the boundaries and inspiring generations of engineers, chemists, physicists and rocket scientists. Keep up the amazing work, can't wait for the 'We Amputated this Guy's Limbs and turned him into Darth Vader' video. But seriously, you guys are awesome. Edit: Sooo, a couple people saw it... lol
I can't believe how much progress you've already made towards the lightsaber! I can't wait to see the finished design!
I love how I just now got my minisaber and then they go on sale
These aren’t lightsabers they are crack lighters
I think Youtube Premium also makes it so I can't see the youtube shopping shelf on your channel....
Aaaaaand purchased.
One day we will get light savers that can actually contact one another.
Just ordered one for my dad to use as a cigar lighter, we both love ur channel
2:10 so like a normal light saber?
I'M SO GLAD I WAITED I LOVE THE BLACK AND BLUE ONE AND I JUST GOT IT (Yes I'm that excited, caps were intentional)
Imma hit some dabs with these!
Working in a cleanroom at ASML in the Netherlands, this was fun too see, though our suits cover even more of the neck and face maybe a thing to look at for you guys. Anyhow very sick work boys
Sombody keep eye on this man
I received 2 red color changers instead of 1 red color changer and 1 green, how can fi ix that? Also my production model is not being consistent with lighting and i just got it.
There is no way regulators are gonna b cool with u selling that but I'm excited to see the chaos that happens when youtubers buy these things
Almost guys are getting there you're getting there
This is awesome i want one so bad you did a good job on that
Lightsaber inflation before gta6
Where could we see more of the Hacksmith Hydrogen Generator?😮😮
This really has crazy scientist vibes and im loving it They are probably going to start their galactic empire in a year or two
What an amazing progress from the beggining, i've been watching you for over 9 years now, and i'm impressed, your truly an inspiration for everyone. I hope I stay for another decade hehe
Cool hot air balloon lightsaber
Great! Now all there's left to figure out is how to make it smaller and how to make the blade more... solid? A high voltage Tesla lightsaber?
I want to see more!
The fact he included a back to the future quote is amazing...
I got the 4th color : White Founder Edition
This was really fun and interesting!
yt shoping omg
Definitely need more Sabres!
It is honestly amazing to see the progress James and the team has made over the years, they literally started in a tiny garage and now have HERC, at this rate in the next 10-20 years there's gonna be an entire campus the size of a small town
Hacksmith is SO back boiz
I used to work in those bunny suits back in the last 90's.  They're great. It's good to see they don't have to worry about radio waves or IR light from the window.  I remember having to carry a special "fab-only" pager, besides a real pager, and when a co-worker left, I had to get his, and he had 3.  In 1997, I was wearing 5 pagers, had 2 cell phones and spent my work hours hanging out in a bunny suit doing defectivity work on computer chips. I was like, "I'm pretty much on the bleeding edge here."
both adblocks are off, yet the shopping is still not showing up, is it like region-specific ?
If I could afford one of the Mini-Sabers I'd for sure get one, especially to support the creation of a real Lightsaber.
Been watching the channel for years now and instantly bought one of the lightsabers you’re selling. So cool
The o shi was so funny I lost it
Hacksmith can build a lightsaber but has no idea how to ship things from his own company. Business's are complicated.
Can’t believe this is just the beginning of lightsaber tech. Love the new concept to keep everything in the hilt like a true lightsaber! Stay safe and congrats on the success of the mini sabers!!🔥
It’s only a matter of time until we get real lightsabers, sooner than we think.
Lightdagger
Was a little sad that crème brulee was included in the list of normal stuff to do with it... Was going to come down and mention that's all I've used mine for aside from bragging rights...
I bet Hector from Texas is SUPER happy watching this video and realising that his minisaber was the very first to be shipped
I just realized couldn’t you make the light sabre using lasers it wouldn’t burn as hard unless you made it really dangerous but give it to the effect where it looks like it’s coming out of the Health and stopping in a certain distance you just create a retractable core little rod That has a mirror and that creates the concave tip look of the light sabre that reflects all the light back into the hilt where it either reflects back to the top or Hass to be absorbed somewhere but if you could get the timing right and everything you can make it look like it’s a legit light sabre when it turns on like you would have the slow extend
658th comment!!!
Military contracts soon?  I mean what commando unit wouldn't want this as a finisher move?
Sweet. I’ll get one and challenge my long lost twin brother with an Irish accent to a lightsaber duel in a motel parking lot. Should be fun.
Oh of course I ordered the founders edition in Australia and other people are saying they've got theirs and here i am waiting to be told that customs have destroyed mine
You guys should make a titanfall titan with a kinetic exo skeleton
It wont last lone ether
Just bought one for my brother for Christmas! Wish I'd thought of it sooner; could've gotten a signed one.
Can you make a lightsaber out of some kind of retractable metal rod that gets really hot ?
You know you could probably pull off the Alan Wake look from Remedy's game
It's a flamethrower. That's not a lightsaber.
The constant intercuts at 2:30 are kinda horrible. Disruptive, obnoxious, uncessary. Ive seen your other videos; I know what explosions and fire are; no need to whack off some stock footage every few seconds.  With that out of the way, I applaud this next project! I know you guys will crush the tech and make it real. I cant wait to see it!
I'm trying to order to Europe (Poland) but I have a problem which link to enter... I want all 3 colors! if there's more... I want them all!
Checks out, I use mine basically every day. Also, can I get an explosion count?
Proud of you guys
I dont see the shopping shelf and my adblocker is off do I need to change my youtube settings
all my friends will be takin jedi dabs with these
Man i'm so happy to be among those who pre-ordered, it was worth it. I can't wait to see what comes next but i belive this mini saber and all the work of years behind it already makes it a piece of sci-fi and engineering history. Just watch out and don't risk your lives for science guys, be safe. ​.
Yes Lightsabers, No more guns 👍
wait til someone robs a store with these💀
Looked everywhere to buy them, but can’t find this “shelf”. Maybe because I am using either YouTube premium or living in the Netherlands?
You should make a Star Wars training droid next using a drone
I waited 6 months for my founders edition. Excited to finally have it
If you make real lightsabers and actually market them, take my money. Take it.
Nice fancy lighter
Purple....
It's crazy how far you guys have come and it's great to see James back in videos with new energy and ideas! Shows how important taking time off can be. It was so cool to see you give a free mini saber to the delivery driver. Acts like that separate you from typical businesses.
Man, kinda wish I hadn't pre ordered the mini saber, because the black one looks so cool
But can you sear a steak with one?
Portal gun next
Good and evil what about mace windo?
Shout out to the LTT screwdriver.
Bogdan is like mandalorian, James is Jedi, and Ian as The Darkside, cool
The aperture logo
These are not lightsabers. These are blowtorches. They can't clash blades.
Can you refill them?
THIS IS LEGENDARY. YOU GUYS ARE LEGENDARY
One of the best companies out there truly trying to improve the world. Where would we be in a few years without real, actual, life-sized lightsabers?
In a level 1000 and 100 clean room and he doesn't have his face covered.... Does he not know he's shedding skin and eyebrow hairs every second¿?
y'all should try making one that works like an actual sword with a blade that expands from the hilts and emits the heat
Can i have one? Im watching on a flip phone
Melee pipe bomb, amazing idea. (For legal reasons this is a joke.)
I think in Star Wars lore, lightsabers also have a high chance of exploding if not built right so this is accurate lol
is the White Lightsaber still available? cant find it in the Store :/
the one youtuber merch i'd buy
Congratulations on yals light progress on making light sabers have a great day hack smith people
Hey guys! I actually was one of the Pre Orders. The ignition is already weakens, and hardly ignites any flame and struggles to hold the flame at a consistent level with the color showing (large orange flame instead, even after burning excessive butane). I also was disappointed to see the new colors were not available to pre orders as I would much rather the black design over the white one. Amazing look and dedication though! Keep on going’
Hacksmith doing literal rocket science now
When the purple one comes out ill buy it
Keep on rockin it my guys
it might not be a Premium Screwdriver lol
Sad but happy to see the mini sabers are sold out
he
NEW EDC???
Proud owner of a founders saber, gotta love these overzealous lighters!
I'm excited to see where these lightsabers go
If you can't see the shop, you can use a VPN to change to, for example Canada. Worked for me to get the 25% off! :)
I liked my comment cuz no one else will
I strive to have a class 100 bedroom.
I hope i can do some of the things you do someday
It won't work hacksmith ur the best
It makes sense that a man that looks like young Obi-Wan Kenobi is constructing lightsabers.
If I didn’t already have a founders edition I’d TOTALLY get the dark one.
Last videos really nice! Good job guys!
U just made me laugh with the huge one…. Thanks 🙏
watch me try to do a cool lightsaber trick but i drop it and the tank leaks into the lit blade
Can't wait to someday own my home defense lightsaber.
I feel like this video is more of a showoff that you can do VFX (with all the cool vfx tricks, and transitions) than it is about lightsabers. :)
Do people really ask why you're trying to build functional lightsabers? They're lightsabers, does anyone need any other reason than that?
not to be a debby downer but what I have seen so far is a combustion saber not proto saber but ive been here since the first version *atleast the video) was out. you do realize that with Elon wanting to be a multi planet species you making light sabers and the world in chaos because the governments that be. when you make this a finished project someone (if they haven't already like me) will do the research and find out how to be a true relief Jedi only thing im worried about is the way the world is now it be the first Sith but the knowledge is there people just have to have the passion to find it all Not a crazy person just one that looks at everything and tries to figure out whats coming down the path based around the facts that are in plain sight.
You should bring back the flying like iron man series after this
Hypes clean room. Then walks in and cant be bothered to put mask over the nose. I mean....
Wondering, once you get the liquid oxygen problem figured out, would you consider designing an extendable and retractable dueling sabre? That would be amazing
Just ordered a mini saber I can't wait 😁
I wish i could get a mini saber but import tax to eu is a big pain
But can i drink it?
Okay, I know this is Youtube, and this is a good video, but the amount of cuts in the monologue at 2:38 onward... it is insane. I don't think there are 10 uncut seconds of him talking without some random explosion sound or cut to fire.
Does this mean we should refer to you all as the Hacksmith Grandmaster, Masters, Knights, and Padawans now?
When we getting your skin in fortnite?
WHERE DO I GET THE CLEAR ONE?!?!?!
i wonder what kind of extra heat output you could get using liquid ozone, to be fair the gains if there is any is probably no worth the danger
So... you are telling me i could make a stealth-flamethrower with hydrogen? Sounds cool :D
They are just lighters
0:40 Smoking with this though..
My parents aid I can’t buy one cause it’s “useless”
Move your location to America it’s less cold in winter and you can work year round without being stopped by snow if you live in Florida that is plus more freedom to make pipe bombs in your backyard XD also have you ever thought of doing a collaboration with the backyard scientist and mark rober one engineer other chemical bomb guy
Hacksmith is doing something, that even large companies wouldn't do. Big respect
A radically simple solution for the lightsaber: built-in electrolyzer that can let oxygen in, but hydrogen out.
Your lightsabers are so cool!
LOL, Yeah I know about the dangers and use of Oxygen…  I used to operate 4 different massive Mitsubishi industrial Co2 CNC Lasers at my friends custom and large run machine shop.  VERY annoying Every time one of the lasers would burst into Flames!! 🤣
I got my in the preorder and it’s so cool! Sadly the signature on the packaging was a little wiped, but its all so crazy
The fact you have a class 100 clean room is unreal. That must’ve been a real challenge.
Wow. We just went through a basic marketing capsule. And above all this, it was entertaining. Well done folks!
You crazy son of a gun. You had me at 25% off. Just ordered the Minisaber. hopefully it gets here safely 💙 Greetings from a fellow Engineer and Tinkerer from Germany
The discount is not showing up for me.  When I click from the YT shelf below the description, it shows up at $130 CAD ($99 USD).  Exactly the same price as if I just go through the regular Hacksmith store.  Am I doing something wrong?
General grevious wants to know your location
I wish the flame was taller
I made it into the video!!! 🥳
It's super dangerous time to play with it
Where's the 'Shopping Shelf'? Even on barebones Chrome I can't see it?
16:04 That would be the most OP hack in starwars. The invisible light saber lol
This is silly but what I really want is that little balanced double pendulum on that desk… how is this not something on your shop haha
I definitely just bought one btw 😂
love it! also, I ordered two gen-2 sabers, with the color changing inserts, as christmas gifts and they've been stuck at "ready to ship" for 12 days now. :( any chance I could get some assistance?
James and Linus should do YouTube boxing , I'm sure there's a flyweight class. 😁
Fire goes up, that means I can’t hold the lightsaber upside down without the risk of burning myself right? What if I want to do a cool lightsaber form?
I have a mini saber already, thanks hacksmith it cool.
does any of hte profit go to *ᵀʰᵉ ᴹᵒᵘˢᵉ*?
found out the mini saber burns too hot for heat shrink, but its still awesome
Let's go
Love this so much!
I have no adblocker on but still can’t see the shelf, which is weird, because on video’s of other YT channels it does work 🤔.
when that one guy at 1 am gets a lab and resources
Isn't that just a flame? Lightsabers have impact when they collide with eachother
Can't wait to use the minisaber to heat up my dab rig
I used to supervise class 1000/10000 cleanrooms, building industrial capacitive touchscreens. Was fun work.
they started off from making fun silly inventions to literally becoming self taught scientists. been watching for a very long time (around 4 years). GOODLUCK HACKSMITH!
You’re not ready for this your kids are gonna love it 😂😂😂 from back to the future
What if you found a way to compress the liquid oxygen? That way you can get a quality volume into a smaller “tank” and it fit inside the hilt of a lightsaber. Also what if you were able to cant the emitter ports so the plasma produced spins into itself and creates a more stable blade and tip? Edit: compress the oxygen more*
Nice
Okay, you win. I just made a purchase. Good luck with the light saber!
This will cool down the handle while still allowing a fire blade!
How do I use the shop with youtube feature? I don't see it.
Im so glad the video team is actually putting the whole saber in frame now.
👀 i know what im getting with my first paycheck
❤❤❤❤❤❤
My lightsaber leaks. I fill it up, use it a little, then an hour later it's empty. Did I get a lemon?
Can you make a spining and folding inquisitor lightsaber
🔥🔥🔥🗣🗣🗣
James I've gotta say that you have accidentally made me feel emotional during this episode. This episode put into perspective how far your team but especially you have come in the 9 years that I've been watching your videos and watching the legacy you have literally built into today. I sincerely and eagerly await to see a great future for you and your team. Def bought a mini-sabre too.😊
yo i made it into the video
Is there any way that I can still get the mini sabers in Australia?
Do you think it could help my friend break out of school
The minisaber has been one of my favorite impulse buys to date. Worth every penny
some real life dr. stone shit happening here
How will it get refilled though
Just bought the Light and Dark Duality Bundle. One of them will be a Christmas present for my Dad who is a massive Star Wars fan. I'm so excited!!!
Fine! If you wont let me have a hydrogen minisaber, I'll just make one myself!
Think I'll stick to Kyber Crystals in my Lightsabers
i can see someone using this to light there cigarette .
Ok, with so many of them, re-enact order 66 or revenge of the sith
In my country because of some stupid laws a minisaber would be considered a weapon and cant be shipped here😭 The law is dumb because it applies to nerf guns
In SW canon, an improperly built light-saber could kill the person using it, or during assembly because it would literally explode.
The world would definitely be a better place if it we didn’t fight for everything and instead worked together to build and improve our technology
i love what you are doing and hope you meet your goal. Good Luck
Is anyone else disappointed they didn't make The Andromeda Strain clean room entry real?  I am definitely getting one of these, just deciding if I should wait until after Christmas.
Surely a worldwide free shipping for Christmas.
The made up galaxy where lightsabers are real is the same made up galaxy that had planet destroying lasers multiple times. It 3 galaxy spanning civil wars in one generation, as well as literal slavery. I can't emphasise how much I don't want to live in that world.
Got my Founders Edition gorgeous white one some days ago, preordered when they released. See yall in 2030 when we have actual ones, thanks to you!
"lightsaber".... Looks like butane lighters.
Your basically selling plasma daggers at this point
I have an Idea on how to make a real Light saber. No Gases to be carries on the back. I mean real.
face it, we all wanted a lightsaber, but we also know we would accidentally chop things off quite quickly if we had one.
So that's why kyber crystals are so explosive
they be playing gretech irl
were learning about flame tests in chemistry and just wondering if you make the flames coloured this way eg copper for green
I can't believe we STILL haven't had people from Disney on-site looking at real Lightsabers...
I love the portal 2 reference with the room
**DARPA ENTERED THE CHAT**: Hi guys! 👋🏾☺️. Whatcu working on..? Need some funding?    **UNITED STATES MILITARY ENTERED THE CHAT** :  “We’ll take it from here thank you  😎👍”
Day 2 of asking you to make shadow’s rocket shoes (air shoes)
It’s actually coming soon! The first video I ever watched was your first retractable plasma based lightsaber build. Here we are now, 3 years later and you guys are about to make a movie accurate cordless lightsaber dream a reality. You’re awesome Hacksmith!
I assume the next step after this will be making it so it will collide with other blades instead of just moving through them
Good luck!
Hi... yeah no,...... you have some great mini, lighters, but thats all they are... shame on you
I have the gold one...I use it when I go camping...
Why is a multi million dollar company asking people for money, even if its for developing a lightsaber. Image what 700.000 USD could be used for in this world...
Were we supposed to get a coin with our pre-order? I didnt see one.
My sisters friend checked the gass level in her moped with a lighter! I heard that it took long time to grow the eye lashes back. :P
NICE
you might want to blur the links of the progress videos
So proud to have seen this come to life! Can't wait to see where it goes!
😮
this guy really is just tony stark
i love how he said like "your kids will love this" yea........... pov kids: *burning everything in their house and themselves*
Okay, I am sold when you said it can do creme brulee
16:30 You got a very audible laugh out of me
Imagine getting a real lightsaber before GTA 6 💀
if you told me 5 years ago the world would not only start to make lightsabers but get this far with it with only one madman I wouldn't believe you
Ever since I was a kid, I’ve wanted a lightsaber and now they’re real. Can’t wait to buy one.
You should put a retractable rod inside the flames so it can make physical contact.
Yall should get George Lucas to use one of the light Saber
You da man!
I Guess i know what to get for Christmas
Epic!!! 😀
Meanwhile the og lighsaber: a glowy stone in a rod with a button
I wish I wasn’t broke I sooooo want one they look so cool 😭😭😭
This is just too incredible. Doing the lords work, James! Definitely ordering my own.
cant see gen 2 on your website? (my location got set to australia)
Impress your friends when you light your farts on fire like a Jedi
Man you could probably do some really cool things with a level 100 clean room
what would you need to make the blade colour a dark purple?
Mini lightsabers look even more scarier than normal lightsabers, it's not like people swing swords when robbing you but a pocket knife so I cant imagine myself getting robbed while dude is showing me a normal size lightsaber but I can imagine getting robbed with mini lightsaber
" you're kids are gonna love it" I love the reference 😂
Now i orderd one Mini-Saber Gen 2 Dark Edition. Was a bit weird with ordering, after 2nd time it worked with PayPal 😄
But you make them way to expensive so no one can get them
Loved the classic Looney Tunes joke
so it's basically a lighter🤔
i don't think i would give this to kids
Damn! What's the name of the hydrogen generator?
It’s awesome that YouTubers are more and more designing awesome products.
You see, if I had the disposable income, I would fund this. I would buy all three and then some. You guys and gals do some of the best work I have ever seen.
literally screamed when i saw the  hydrogen saber through the thermal camera 😭
i love how the mini sabers are literally just butane torches with a different body
Could we have a series on how the clean room was built ? Also, is the noise unavoidable ? Must be hard to bear 😅
Will you kiss mine too?
Hacksmith is secretly running a deathstick lab. I just know it.
I pre-ordered the mini saber and its awesome. The new design options are even cooler. Im still very happy with the golden one. I just couldnt wait to get one XD
Its incredible how far you have come, i love it!
Started watching this channel about 7yrs ago when you guys did the Batman grappling hook and Batarang vids, and I have to say, it's astonishing the amount of progress all of you have made in seven years.  Well done!    Wish all of you nothing but the best of luck and success on your work.  Stay awesome!
Is the gas tank changable? just wondering
man theyre so expensive:(  but not expensive in its overcharged but expensive i just dont earn enough. thats what i safe now a little bit every day so i can buy one. or 2. maybe even every modell.  as always: amazing job guys i love you
Bogdan plays Warframe~!? Tell him I'd love to play when he isn't soaked in liquid oxygen R&D!
Are the White one coming back?
At this point you guys should just kickstart the Canadian space industry, you’re already making effectively what is a rocket engine.
I have to get these ones I have the gen 1 minisaber so now I um I need to complete the set
Really would like the hydrogen one lol
I don’t have a shopping button, guess it’s region-specific ?  Anyway, that’s absolutely insane
holy shit, you guys are really becoming like real life stark industries
I want it!!! I dont got it :ccc why i dont have money :D
as someone trained to work in an asceptic room for pharma. the bunny suits give me flashbacks
332th yAY
I love the aperture style logos on the equipment, I however would recommend avoiding AI research especially involving deadly neurotoxin
Can’t wait!
You can have more
Did he just say "Canadian Pesos"?
Wow. It's been a long wait, but you guys did NOT disappoint!
Finally, youngling scene cosplay gonna be lit !
As much as I love the idea the things that could go wrong with a real lightsaber kinda scare me.   Be sure to cover all your legal bases Hacksmith  Even on these mini ones.
Not cheap dam its like 90 dollars
i want one
Already got one :-) white one and a coin. because i wanted in on this
still cant see the youtube store, 3 different browsers and none with adblock
Told my wife to get me one for Christmas but I’m gonna order one just in case she doesn’t pull thru
It’s a lighter. A super impressive lighter, but a lighter.
I can't find the right butane refills for my mini saber any tips on where/what brand to buy
lightsabers are interesting but I think I could improve it by changing nozle
Gotta love that giga saber xD
Got my Founders Edition!! woot woot!
Hacksmith: "We're the only people developing lightsabres."  Alex Lab: Iron Man 2 moment /j
Hacksmith just commercialized hydrogen production 🥲(in theory)
All the aperture science references are great to see. Love to see progress on the lightsabers. An idea from Cave Johnson - combustible lemons to but your house down! Probably not legally allowed.
This is so unnecessary… I lOVE IT
Hi
Imagine if he finally gets to a real lightsaber and it gets 10000 views
I bought one of the pre order Founders Edition gen 2 white sabers. Love it and love the challenge coin. I kind of don't want to open the box because of the signatures.
This is the first time i ever bought something from a content creator
HOLY CRAP PORTAL REFERANCE
I am amazed by amount of explosions and video production put. This grew to insane sizes from the garage boys making some funny things like Thor hammer.
Oops! All lightsabers!
Got mine a week ago, use it everyday in the workshop!!🤘
alright but lemme see you swing it around
Bro kudos to the delivery guy wearing shorts out in a blizzard
Honestly you guys are inspiring and are litterally making the crazy dreams in our heads possible. Keek doing what your doing can't wait for the next lightsaber vid!
Definitely trying to get the v2 with the inserts and the inserts for my v1
This is awesome, they look so sleek and clean. Impressive, I hope I'll be able to get one
Going a danger route is see. Why dont you go even future. Use floride instead of oxygen(=joke), its even more reactive and has more energie. And in liquid form, it pretty much comes out burning the surrounding air. Dont forget to use teflor containers.
You guys do so much crazy stuff and as sayed its totally bonkers from Garage building to Laboratory research, incredible, breathtaking
Me: lightsabers are real. Trust me. Random person: Dude, I think you've been watching too much star wars. Me: *Shows them this.* Random person:    :O
most explosions in one video
So cool!! Cant wait for the full lightsaber build!
It's kinda crazy how much money is going into this real life lightsaber project which I assume is only going to be used in the videos. I think that's gonna be a lot of videos to make the money back!  I mean surely liquid oxygen is too dangerous to ship and sell to people... right?
This is so cool
It’s funny because In Star Wars if you didn’t assemble the parts to a lightsaber correctly it would blow up
I love the design of the dark one, especially the fact that you can mix the colours and create a beam of rainbow, RGB mini-saber!
This is amazing the growth of this group. ❤❤❤
You need to contact Mr. Beast asap about this. If he can spend 5 million $ on a squid game reenactment video, sure he can find a milion or 2 for the real life lightsaber.
Guys this is legal???
bros playing modded minecraft
Fuuuudge! I really want one! haha But no money no funny. 🥲
its good to see that you are beginning the first step of sizing it down so respect and even if you face challenges continue to go on like you have always done with lightsabers or other projects
Don't clean rooms usually have airlocks and air showers before entry?
But for real though, how long before these guys are officially classified as defense contractors
Don't give up you will achieve lightsabre
I like how your calling them lightsabers cause the fact its now kind of possible is really cool but at the same time thinking about what this thing actually is in the way it functions, I find it insane that youve figured out a way to literally sell functional handheld rocket engines legally. I love it
Watching these makes me appreciate the journey we got to see you come from.
You definitely need to clarify that the discount only applies in cart. I thought it wasn't working for a good 10 to 15 minutes.
The mini sabre is great, lasts longer than you think on one charge. Only took 5 days door to door to get into Australia.
This deserves way more views
Preorders 🔛🔝
Can I use the force to get one of these instead?
What are the chances of getting a new mini saber that looks like a Gen 1 but has the advancements of the current mini saber.
Somehow seems like a very good front against ltt / their screwdriver.
More colours? I can't justify ANOTHER minisaber.... but the dark side, it calls to me...
Guys, the word is not ready for lightsabers, please stop, just.... just trust me on this.
people really spend hundreds of dollars on prop lightsabers and then the hacksmith lets you buy a Real Actual Lightsaber for ~$60. love these guys
Your kids will love them? Back to the future reference?
Very high quality product! I pre-ordered it in May and I love it! It's worth to buy! And thanks for including my selfie in the video! 😅 Good luck with the lightsaber project! May the force be with you guys! 😉
Oh wow
Love the light sabre series amazing work, where is the link to the discounted store I can’t seem to find it in the description unless I am missing something.
I wonder what the timeline on the new lightsaber is. It's gonna win awards for its design 100%
You must respect the power... I burned my hand with mine in 3 days. Thanks for not selling me the big one 😅
te most expensive lighter ever
37 min ago!
i mean i wouldnt mind one
Aren't there usually "Airlock"-type rooms where you change into the suits before you enter the cleanroom?
I was expecting 100s in price but it's only 80£
This whole project is, kinda terrifying.. plz be safe guys!
It is so crazy how far they’ve come
these look like a stupid idea that will burn your eye out when u try to light a cigarette , and also will need constant refilling
Imagine they accidentally discover a new hi-tech material or something, science is like that sometimes...
Cool
make the falcon suit pls
Neat
Wtf was that edit lol
The unnecessary dig at Linus' screwdriver was solid.... but what if there was a collab between the two and we get a lightsaber screwdriver....
That crazy
Omg this is awesome I want this!!
So happy to see YouTube sponsoring this video! You definitely deserve it, so proud of how far you've come. Hope you take the time to appreciate what you've built now and then.
The use of liquid oxygen is actually perfect because if somebody assembles his lightsaber wrong, it will quite literally explode, just like in the lore.  Edit: Tysm for the likes :0
There is always on Youtube this suspension of disbelief that you do when people claim stuff like this because of course how can a single Youtuber actually do something like this or even close to it,so you kind of pretend that it's amazing when it's just good,because of the effort they put in and the editing getting you hyped but this is ACTUALLY amazing  I don't think a giant corporation with limitless resources could have done something better if they tried with current technology,congratulations and you even managed to make a mini version of it
help i killed my addblock and tried 3 different browsers but the shelf won't come
I love the Aperture logo in the clean room xD. love you guys What about Black-Mesa though? :]
Bought a Gen 1 saber for my Dad for Christmas. All of his grill and cigarette lighting will now be done with a lightsaber.
The Shelf is a myth
Well I ordered mine more then a week ago and it's not even been sent out yet so what's up with that ?
Amazing work.     "Don't worry, we will cut that out." -lies.
i want the giga one
Damn that looks hella cool 😎
I am curious as to how they'll manage sabers clashing. It's been long theorized(and more or less confirmed in rebels) that sabers utilize a magnetic element to keep the blade intact. Maybe they'll be able to utilize something to that regard?
I purchased the mini saber and loved it. Where can I watch the development of the saber?
Needs some sort of magnetic thing to keep the plasma solid-like
2:08 😊 perfect love the meme reference
Unfortunately there is a company taking the light saber and claiming it’s theirs aka Nikola toyshop
this keeps me sane
One day hacksmith industries will make themselves gods
I'm going to fight to get one.
Yo!
Jesus theres an explosion sound every two seconds
Hey james I brought the prototype version earlier this year and I made a comment on your instagram about it being shorter without knowing they are and in sorry because I understand it made you a bit annoyed and I’m just here to apologise  The mini saber has been one of the coolest things I’ve ever owned and I actually use it very often to start my log burner and to clean up 3d prints removing the strands on it
For Indian brothers, it's over 250 USD including shipping🤑🤑
It is so nice to see hack smith doing so good. If you ever create more products in the future I'll be there to buy it. Because they're just fun to use.
Hi guys I really love your videos and the lightsaber series. I would like to buy a mini-saber but it's too expensive
If you guys ever want somebody to build lightsaber replicas I'm your guy. I have 14 original designs and I use to work for a company called saber forge making light sabers and have had a few more companies interested in my saber smithy abilities
i love the aperature laboratories reference from portal 2 in the clean room. Portal gun when 🗣🗣🗣
0:19 the back to the future references
That back to the future reference at the start was brilliant, props to James
Absolute legend I don't know when in my life.. but ill be getting a Red or Gold Saber.. and perhaps a working weaponless Ironman Suit :p  imagine me doing parkour in that dear lord lol, Id love to personally help/learn to make a black daredevil suit that would allow me to do parkour without sight. I'm thinking cameras along my body and arms that would trigger vibrations in 360 degree's around Direction/part of my body the objects are near.. so might be able to actually do some stunts.
That's not how a light saber really works. Actually lightsabers the light spins more like chainsaw from my understanding.
i am sorry that i am broke
8:27 🤣 love the portal themed hacksmith laboratories
I dont have an Adblocker but can't see the shopping shelf 😢
i like that you have mad scientist hair james
I love the aperture laboratories style of your logo in the clean room.
there's no such thing as too much lightsabers.
Absolutely love the portal references all over the lab 10:17
man i wish i had one of those lmao
cheap .shot at ltt
You guys are absolutely crazy and i love it! Thank you guys
Bogdin’s British voice was so funny
Thats not a lightsaber thats  straight up a flamethrower 😂😂
It’s lit
6:21 HOLY CRAP
Pocket knife: ❌  Pocket Lightsaber: ✅
If your gonna make a room that precise and clean then you might as well start making your own night vision lenses *hint hint* ;)
Can someone help me pls i dont know how to get the 25% discount
14:22 i was about to pitch you this idea lol
Díky!
Incredible fascinating!
Wish you guys could sell the hydrogen saber legit would be cool asl but i’ve watched you guys for 3 years i started getting really into it with the railguns but the lightsabers kept me keep up the good work🫡🫡
I have my mini saber and it is amazing!
Very cool
These guy went from their backyard, to this. Insane
👍🏻👍🏽👍🇬🇧🇬🇧
Fun personal experience: for about a year, I worked in a silicon wafer manufacturing facility with Class 10 clean rooms. No perfume, cologne, makeup, or even deodorant was allowed on the people working in there. And no skin exposed. Everybody had to wear full body suits that were sealed, and goggles that even had small air filters in them.
Oh my Sweet Celestia I love the logo design with aperture science.  And I'd say it's accurate because you guys are the embodiment of "Science is about WHY NOT?!"  Also love how the videos are feeling now and am really excited to seeing more content
I just love how much stuff they get from Vevor.
Hacksmith is actually going to create world's first fully functional real lightsaber
there is no shopping shelf for me
the Aperture labs references!!
safe to use with cigars? if so I know what I'm buying for christmas gifts
hi
I loved the LTT screwdriver callout that was perfect
Today i was watching the old lightsaber videos and wondering when the next part will come!
1st World Problems:
Hmm
can I get one idk if they allow them in my home XD
send me one
I’m here b4 7k views
Should move the clean room to the other side of the compound 🤣 just in case
Under hour gang  👇
I wish i could afford one that so nice looking! dreams of being anakin are coming true every moment
"this might not be a premium screwdriver" the greatest backhand slap ever
Hacksmith how abaut you build a the future tank wich are  wery strong
Just got mine last week, absolutely love it
For me?
25,000 degree celcius lightsaber when ?
The fact that all of you are just chilling in the snow is great. 10/10, very Canadian.
How can you sell this
I can't wait to see where this research goes. I know that some universities are working on ways to make self-contained magnetic fields and then combining that with plasma and laser technology.
Lightsabers>charity
Where is the YouTube shopping shelf
Oh no DHL half of them won't get to where they're supposed to go they'll end up stuck in a warehouse or sold on the black market as undelivered Goods
Holy force ghost batman 😢 Not shipping the gen 2 to Australia
Appreciating the lethality of this project with those explosions😂
Amazing
Don't just read off people's names and stuff and where they're at for who's getting this product maybe they want to be anonymous kind of a violation of their privacy to just read off their shipping information and broadcast it for the world
Not a light saber. It's just an over-sized cigarette lighter.
nice
These guys really push the limit of what’s possible
Todays fact: 7 people can’t be first
I tried to buy one, but it’s still showing the same price when I click the link on the shelf if in the YouTube app for iOS: $99. I’m in the US if that helps?
Congrats on the sponsorship. Pretty huge
At this point, you guys are going to attract Thanos or Darth Vader himself. Because to be honest, someday you will have made a fully operational Iron Man suit! And k loved the “you guys aren’t ready for it yet, but your kids are gonna love it” Back to the Future reference
imagine you guys get in contact with elon musk for this project, could be really sick
giz one then.
Hi thank you for the lightsaber
Funnily enough, the Star Wars behind-the-scenes dvd that I own has a post credit scene where a child recieves an actual lightsaber for his birthday. His grandmother was then suddenly halved.
I love what these guys are doing.  Can't wait to get one
Imagine they forgot the "DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME" and some one goes out and goes boom. Also, "A single dust particle... could cause the lightsaber to become a bomb," Lightsabers arrive and are dropped.
They look like kitchen blowtorches but with the flame above instead of on the side.
Please test the winter soldier arm
Glad to see you happy😊
Not a starwars fan. More of a pirates of the caribbean guy. But I loved watching each lightsaber get more and more realistic. It's an amazing project, with an amazing team!
😮 Shut Up And TAKE MY MONEY!!!
I remember writing a comment regarding using a jet of pure oxygen for increased cutting speed but Video's great so far
Wait the regular size one arent buyable for like how many years?
Back to the future, it is a good film.
HiiiI
The funny thing ABT these light Sabers is they are sold on the markets as lighters
video isn't even out long enough and people are commenting like they finished it lol.
Hacksmith is gonna create the New Republic by 2030
got here in less than 5 minuets
I just bought a Gen 2 mini saber and colour inserts Yesterday I guess I should’ve waited a day 😭 ❤
Will it light a cigarette or will it ruin it
please make me be in one of your videos
This is about right them making a real sabre and love the back to the future reference
SUPER
