It’s Been a Great Trade. Quick didn’t even Play the 4th Quarter against us, Wednesday and RJ is Hurt..We’re like 45-9 with OG Playin so all good
Didn’t put us in front of Philly is what Shannon said 😂
Dagg Steven. Just dagg.
This aged well
They shouldn’t never traded RJ if they wanted to move on from him then they should of gotten a star center for him.
This is just another reason why SAS shouldn't be taken seriously ever.
Hey, who’s laughing now after the trade?
IQ didn't want to stay with Knicks otherwise he would have signed over the summer. He wanted to start and dont think he could start with Brunson.
With a head that big you’d think there might be a brain to match, hell no!
It’s approved Stephen A was wrong
Didn’t this age like milk lmao stephen a such a clown
Look for him to change his energy once the Knicks start winning….. Straight Clown!!!!
BOY WAS HE WRONG😂😂😂 🗽🗽🗽🗽
This take has aged as well as a bottle of milk left out of the fridge. This was the missing piece, and the Knicks have the best record in 2024 (as of January 25th).
Trade the the draft picks for Vucevic
Nobody gives a D@mn if Stephen is moved or not . Im tired of this 🤡. He always talking some silly shxt
Lmao as a dallas Cowboys fan this brings me joy😂 seeing Stephen a Smith upset
Stevie A just wants somebody he knows will SHOWWW UPPPP during playoff time 😁
Bad Trade For Knicks 👎🏿
W trade for both teams. Idc what anyone says. Its FACTS. Pin this comment
SAS ... thinks he is important to the Knicks !!😂😂😂😂
Knicks are 0-4 since acquiring him and beat the Sixers by 30 plus.
This guy just wants the flashiest trades and part of the problem. Then jumps on when good things happen with the right players
KNICKS GOT FLEECED PERIOD
Steven A. Smith is the Joe Biden of the sports world... incoherent rambling that goes nowhere.
Stephen A is underrating defense , they need a player for the second unit for balance Brunson is truly one of the best players in the league, this is from a Raptors fan , defense helps win titles.
Toronto fan here. We will miss OG. But we love the trade!
😮‍💨 S.Anothony Smith, anyone can go on TV and loudly blab whatever they want. You just do it loud enough to get attention. You're really not a Knicks fan, they only know you exist because you're, uh, loud. You surely don't own them to claim they're "yours".  Get off the bandwagon because they're good. Go ask Doris Burke to share LeBeon fandom.
Hop off donavan mitchell u know what hes not that dude
Donovan Mitchell is the worst person we could get. I have someone either Lauri Markkhanen or bring back Prozingus. Both are tall and deceptively amazing on defense. But now they both can score on a facets. We have speed with Brunson, Randle is power, Josh Hart ironically is heart and passion, …
I honestly feel like Stephen A just wants a box office/high profile name in NY
As a Knicks fan we don’t claim this clown
They should've kept Quickly and gotten rid of a first, still they should move those picks for something else. Not Mitchell.
SAS is so stuck on a superstar coming to the Knicks over the team being competitive you got a team that’s making the second round b2b years most likely when they’ve been basically a joke since 1999 and a couple Melo years just enjoy good basketball for now and make it appealing for a superstar to want to sign there let the nets screw up again and trade for Donovan for a dozen picks and if you were to go for a star now trade Randle for Lauri or Siakam at least
Why is Stephen A so desperate for Spida when Jalen's been torching him for the few years
Why Stephen A have to be so ignorant about this move 😭
Now that they have Anunoby, if they do get Donovan Mitchell, they will be legit title contenders.Without OG, that wouldn't be the case because they would still be weak on defense.
If the knicks get Donovan Mitchell it will ruin the team
Donovan Mitchell is a great player, BUT, he is NOT the player for this team
Anunoby Anooby 😐🤦🏽‍♂️😂 Can tell yall don’t watch the Raps
Raptors got exactly what they needed, 2 guys who can attack off the dribble. Now they  have to shoot the ball better + improve situational defence Og was great for Raps but still hadnt developed into an iso threat. He'll be great for NY too but he needs a handle if he's going to evolve his game
Seeing the comments be so salient and not fall in with SAS's take on this is wonderful. Hoping you Knicks fans the best of luck, finally making good, slow, methodical decisions with the intent to win, not microwave anything.
Steven a is the same guy that said Jalen brunson was a nobody and he wasn't going to pan out in New York 😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
All the knicks need to do is sign Kevin porter jr and there you go, problem solved. New 6th man lol
SAS does not know basketball, simple as that. Dunno why he on there, def not for basketball knowledge
Quickley is the best player in this trade. Masai fleeced the Knicks once again.
Molly... say it with me. anna-no-be, it's not very hard. Especially for someone who reads a teleprompter as a career.
This is agreat trade for both teams if OG signs (I think he will).  As a raptors fan I'm sad to see OG go, but he is gonna be good no matter where he goes.  No drama, hard worker, guy and wants to have an increased role, well here is his chance. RJ and Quickly, thank you for the young players. RJ is gonna be huge, watch.  He is back home!!!
Funny how they don’t mention my Heat
Knicks Traded Topping Barrett & Quickly stupid 😡
I’m so sick of this guy I’m outta here
This trade wasn’t intended to put us at the top of the East… it’s simply a step in that direction. Relax.
This trade made sense financially for both teams especially given the money IQ will be getting this offseason. Knicks still hoarding those 1st round picks and Barrett gets to go home. It’s a win all around for both teams. Knicks get a big defensive wing who can guard multiple positions and shoot the 3.
Stephen A. will only be happy if they get either Durant, LeBron, D. Mitchell or Curry.
No one can say OG's name properly... what a joke lmao
In this world the NBA revolves around two teams, the Knicks and Lakers. The rest of the league, from the elite teams to those rebuilding are merely 'resources' to be acquired or extracted.
Ngl the guy that does move the needle fr is dejounte murray we need somebody like that 6’6 7ft plus wingspan and he’s quick and strong
Shut up Stephen
We don’t care as a lifelong Knicks fan I don’t want this fake fan with us.
No One Important Will Come To NYK Jim Dolan Is A Cancer Until He Sells The Team We Won't Win A Chip!
fool
1 tiny guard just about works if that guy is a really good PG (Brunson, Curry etc).  2 tiny guards has no chance in hell of working, Donovan Mitchell would be an awful fit for this team.
Stephen A should turn in his Knicks fandom card.
I mean this is a good start for Knicks  And it doesn’t always have to be a all star or a superstar this just the start of something good for the knicks
Yes SAS lets have 6'0 Jalen Brunson and 6'1 Donovan Mitchell in the backcourt guarding people in the playoffs!
SAS correct Knicks add SPIDER MITCHELL n we set for the playoffs . GO KNICKS 🔥
Jalen Brunson is better than Donovan Mitchell right now , why bring in another Jalen Brunson when you alrdy have a Jalen Brunson, Knicks , need size, shooting, defense, versatility, and chemistry
Should've just dealt Barrett, kept Quickley.
Stephen A never moved by the Raptors
What a genius…
Rj barret going back to his country
This guy just don't know Basketball nothing but a big mouth. Yeah give up all your assets for mitchell & watch NYK move but an inch closer to Mil & Bos.
So Donovan Mitchell in the same backcourt as Jalen Brunson works how exactly?? I guess OG will defend all the perimeter players? Who is the primary ball handler between the two and who goes and stands in the corner?
The trade was garbage. RJ and Quick are going to make the Knicks look incredibly stupid. Short sighted trade.
Toronto, we did not want to lose OG Stephen.   U have put your foot in your mouth.  Watch and see.
Aint no way I’m trading Quickly and RJ for OG!
That make up person got to unc shay again
Aged bad. OG is a big piece
Shannon sharpe reaction at 0:19 ahahaha😂😂😂😂 and another Stephen A rant losing his mind on the knicks I love it ahahaha
Stephen A. Is a certified clown make no mistake about it
Stephen A has to get over Donovan Mitchell already. He's so convinced that getting him is going to somehow make them prime contenders. While it won't hurt them, obviously, it won't make them championship level, either. Besides, with Brunson, Randle, and now Anunoby in the fold, you can build around those three through the draft. Stop trying to make these big splash signings. Build for the future, while you still can.
when SAS says “i’m not moved”, it means the knicks made a great move.  i learned to appreciate everything SAS does not.
Not moved, huh? Ex-Lax, that should help you. As for you alleged knowledge of basketball?   Sorry, brain cells can’t be added or replaced. Perhaps some sutures for your lips? We could all use some silence out of you.
OG is an allstar just watch him this year in a better role
a better idea would be to keep all the picks and use them
U should like this
Anybody know what Song was that at the end?
Did the Knicks get fleeced?
If Stephen A don't like it I know its a good move!!!
Nicks coach is a defensive minded coach, probably he just wanted to add a really good defensive player to his team 😆😆😆😆
Donovan Mitchell is not gonna work well with Jalen brunson. They need a long guard.
could've got more for RJ + IQ
That just shows how little basketball I.Q. Stephen A has
im happy knicks fans in this comment section know more than sas
Who is he ?
Don't worry the next trade will put them over the top.
Quickly and Barret or OG? They refused to trade RJ for Mitchell but then make this trade.   I gave them a ton of credit when they traded for Brunsen when everybody thought they fkd up, but this one is a def win for Toronto.   RJ being Canadian they can build their future around him.
I like this trade just because they didn't go for donovan mitchell or zach lavine because you'll probably lose julius randle in that trade or if somehow you manage to pull out without losing him you would seriously impact dynamic between brunson and randle which is working so far.
Come on it’s your job to know how to pronounce a players name it’s not hard Molly
I am surprised hes more accepting of the 3 and d role on the knicks but wanted to have a bigger role than that on the raptors
Stephen A For Atrocious, he has an ego problem and he is just trying to naysay to be different not because he believes what he says ,.what a lame
They got rid of Qickley. What!!!   Not good.
Mehhh…
SAS said absolutely nothing.
Yeah quickly the Knicks shouldn't of traded him stupid
I like Donovan but only if he’s coming off the bench.    That would be serious bench power.    We def need some scoring with the 2nd team.     I know it’s a pipe dream.   But to get Donovan and let him come off the bench and provide that flame thrower scoring.  We def winning the chip lol.
Steven A will never be Steven A because his name is Steffan
Knicks nation don’t care what you think 🤦‍♀️ Stephen A
WHACK!  They are not just better defensively. Not only is OG’s 3 point shooting more consistent, but the whole team seemed to be running the floor & cutting more, which provided effective ball movement & scoring.  Also, the defensive energy created offense. There was some concern that Quickly & Brunson didn’t really gel on the floor together. Can see the same happening with D. Mitch, though Brunson would probably defer a bit more.
Calling it now my Celtics☘️vs New York knicks in the championship game
get trery young
HYUK YUK YUK XD
didnt know quickley went as well.... were doomed
HE'S NOT THE VOICE OF THE KNICKS HES A SIDE CHICK KNICK.
Your not getting a 6'1" G in Donovan Mitchell who doesn't play D, their either getting Murray from ATL or DeRozan and Drummond from the Bulls.
This move makes the Knicks much more attractive free agency destination. Not a knicks fan, but I think it was a solid move that improves the roster now and potentially lure free agents.
Brunson is HIM for the knicks. They better off give up less and building around Brunson
These takes are just over the top performance for the camera nonsense. It's a great trade for both teams
Everybody know Stephen A not a real Knicks fan we don’t take him seriously
Donovan Mitchell😂😂😂
Anyway that's a good move because O.G brings a size presence inside on both ends of the floor. Not to mention that the brother is a terrific 3 point shooter. R.J was rather one dimensional player and couldn't bring a defensive presence inside. You just look for flashy players, Stephen A. but you forget that everything that shines is not necessary gold.
Since SaS is ALWAYS WRONG the Knicks just hit it out of the park.
Doesn't say a word about the raptors lol
Knowing how star-crazed SAS is... He low-key prolly just researched who OG was when the trade was done. 😂😂😂
Stephen A's obsession with D. Mitchell is quite concerning
This guy wants us to gut our team for Mitchell
No one cares what this fraud thinks
He didn’t say nothing wrong
I find it funny how most people in these comments sound like they know more then SAS! which we all probably do! Id bet my left nut SAS dont actually watch the games! Just listen to him talk about NFL! He KNOWS NOTHING!
The guy in the gray suit doing all the talking comes across as a pretentious loudmouth.
Stephen A how u gon have Mitchel & Brunson as ur back court?? Come on man.. it’s great basketball but that ain’t a title winning backcourt
Knicks got fleeced again and next yr they'll sue Raptors for this
The orlando magic are the team to watch in the east they have 2 closers both 20 and 21 have the cap space this summer to get better and own all there picks
When SAS doesn’t like it , I know it will pan out .
Well, he is giving an informative opinion. I agree they can't beat Boston, Milwaukee, Philly and add Miami
I didn't like the trade. Bad one overall.
Fans look at it like OG or IQ. But really what he is saying is you needed to find a way to get OG and keep quick (basically offer something else another player or picks). Because you need secondary ball handling / playmaking on this team, and depending on Julius for that can be very tricky especially in crunch time when he is prone to meltdowns. Its like you fill one hole but you created another hole on your team. And you are trying to convince yourself that the hole you created is not that big of a hole.
Yo Stephen A is so short term thinking.... At Mitchell wouldn't mesh with our team at all we're a defensive minded team with a defensively minded first head coach and he wants us to trade draft picks, money, and core players for a star with a name that dont play defense thats why he's a commentator and dont even hate Stephen A I'm just happy he doesn't influence anybody in our front office....I loved when we picked up Brunson but he wanted us to give up the whole kitchen sink for Mitchell or Lillard so we're just going to put a star on a sorry team with no depth he's thinking like fan and not a GM build a core that'll last some years then add your missing piece
Its doesnt matter who bring in right now, as long as Randle, Thibs is here it doesn't matter. Thibs doesnt make adjustments and he is not a versatile coach he plays the same offense and that iso ball with Randle pump faking his life away and losing the ball will def not get us anywhere. Stephen A. is correct on this I watch every single game and see whats going on. He is very structured with it, every time the 5 min mark comes he makes his subs, a player can be hot knocking them down and next min they coming out the game. Where does that make sense at. Who is filling in for Randle when he doesnt show up in the playoffs. Thats more work on everyone Brunson doesnt have RJ there to close, cause that's who got us to the second round were those two.
Mitchell would be niceeee
This trade made sense financially for both teams especially given the money IQ will be getting this offseason. Knicks still hoarding those 1st round picks and Barrett gets to go home. It’s a win all around for both teams. Knicks get a big defensive wing who can guard multiple positions and shoot the 3.
SAS sounding like an average fan. How is this man called an “nba analyst”?
I completely disagree. We went up against the Timberwolves, the number 1 seed in the west, and the number 1 defensive team in the league. We won because of our defense, good plays, and offensive boards. They had more turnovers than we did. All that while Brunson had an off day. We finally have something here and I think OG is a good fit for this team. I still think we need bench help because we can’t ALWAYS rely on Randle and Brunson for scoring, but time will tell
if the Knicks trade for Mikal Bridges instead of Donovan Mitchell, I think that makes them a better team tbh. They have Fournier's contract, draft picks, Robinson's contract if they're willing to move on from him because of his injury status, and in return get Bridges and Dinwiddie, I think they would be contenders.
So when will thibs be held accountable and obviously you don’t watch my Knicks . Grimes ! Donte ! Evan hart can all score smhhh
Us Knicks will never claim this guy as a real fan
He don't even talk about the other side of the trade  all he cares about is America lol
Personally I wasn’t moved by the Brunson signing when it happened or the Randle signing, was wrong on both fronts so I’ll hold my opinion for at least a couple weeks on this guy, at this rate your prolly better off staying away from someone like Mitchell and just got the Murray route, sign Mitchell if it doesn’t work out.
We know Stephen hasn't watched a single Raptors game since the 2019 'chip, you can stop pretending to know anything about OG
Anunuby? Do your job and learn to pronounce the man's name correctly, Jesus Christ.
I agree with Steve mostly.  I was also upset with Quickley leaving.  I called him the NY Steph Curry, because he could pop a 3 from just about anywhere, and he improved his drive game as well.  But with the new guys coming in from the trade, I think the knicks are overall better with the trade.
but he didnt talk about how bad quickley is in the playoffs
SA NO ONE CARE HOW U FEEL
I didn't know we had 8 first round picks! We could definitely get a D. Mitchell or a Derozan. We are so close!! I dont agree with Stephen about Quickley. We have the Big Ragu! (Divincenco). OG is a defensive beast!!
THIS MAN IS JUST GARBAGE, HE SHOULD PLAY ALL FIVE POSITIONS AND THE BENCH BY HIM SELF, HE'S AS BITTER QUININE🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬😡😡😡😡😡😡
Og can guard other teams best player and can get you 20 a game 🔥 or at least 15 to 20 a game. He need a mid post game to get to that 20 ppg per game.
I mean I guess OG is the best player the Knicks could’ve traded for. They weren’t going to get any tier 1 superstar that would put u in instant Conference finals/Finals contention. Donovan Mitchell wouldn’t be able to get the Knicks to the conference finals. The Knicks’s ceiling will be the second round until they can get a superstar.
SAS comments are for entertainment purposes only.
I really don’t understand why Stephen A thinks Donovan Mitchell is the missing link for the Knicks.
Stephen A thinks like a casual fan.
Imagine zion draft by knicks and become like him right now, saf will be fuming XD
Smart trade, big names don't always equate to
Smart trade, big names don't always equate to
Smart trade, big names don't always equate to
SAS don't watch basketball 😂
Stephen A Smith is almost the worst analyst on TV. Donovan Mitchell is a star but he isn't carrying the Knicks to a chip. Even with those draft picks.
Has stephen a ever even watched a basketball game
Mitchell is a pipe dream, guy has one playoff that he showed up
Why do we care about what Sas has to say ... The same person who' wanted us to trade the entire team for melo instead of waiting and picking him up off-season with a full squad .. tired of his wishy washy fandom
Good trade confirmed if sas doesn’t like it.
They just defeated the best team of the west! Brooo come on
Stephen A doesn't deserve to stay a knicks fan. Go root for Brooklyn because, we don't want you lol
Knicks won in this trade, OG IS OG!  The dude is invisible on the court and once he has the ball in his hands, it's over before you know it. Defensively this guy is great, there's a reason he's been on 2 all-defensive teams.  I would have rather Toronto traded Scottie Barnes instead, I still don't see anything special about the guy at all.  OG is a big loss for Toronto and a massive gain for the Knicks.
OG is so effin good. It’s crazy how many people downplay his impact. Like he’ll be great in the playoffs with his defense and he’s a good shooter.
As a Knicks fan, the problem is the league is just too good  and stacked right now. I honestly can’t see us getting through a healthy Boston, Bucks or some of the top west teams. Everyone yelling get a superstar. Who? So we’ll give away the team to get Donovan and be in the same position or worse? There’s no other “superstar” that would willingly part with their team imo. Best thing NY can do is play their best basketball and hopefully they get some luck on their side like when Atlanta went to the Eastern finals.
Everyone just hates on Stephen A for likes
Mitchell is overrated. Even with Mitchell they ain’t eating the Celtics or the bucks
sad to see rj go but its fine, because this upcoming offseason donovan is coming home
Yall can't have it all
I would love to see Stephen A as a GM just so I can laugh as he fucks everything up
Stephen A’s a jerkoff
TOO OTHER PLAYERS FROM THE RAPTORS. MOLLY IS S A TRAIN WRECK
In the end you need someone who can guard Jimmy, Tatum, Tobias, consistently. If you even want a chance at a title run. OG is a great pick up.
Does Donovan Mitchell put them above Boston? Your team just got better and he still not happy😂 every nba team wants og
Terrible trade. Quickley is better than everyone the Knicks got back.
Stephen A doesnt know ish about building a team!! He just a star groupie!! Smfh
As a Raptor fan there is no doubt that OG is a benefit as a defensive player with some scoring but the problem that the Raptors encountered was that he thought more of himself as a scorer than is the reality and he also will want a contract in the high 30s .  Perhaps he will change his attitude . If IQ works out as a starter than Toronto wins the trade. Precious will be missed as he had a good attitude.
OG put fear in players eyes
Donovan Mitchell and Brunson can't work on the same team as starters. What is Stephen A. talking about? He is constantly starstruck and never considers team balance. SMH
Quickly is special? He’s average at best
🪡🪡➡️➡️🧡💙🧡💙
Mitchell is a ball hog
OG is inconsistent. COming from toronto fan
Donovan Mitchell and Jalen Brunson would make for a very small backcourt with no defense. How you suppose to stop those Trees over in Milwaukee with such a small backcourt and no defense. SMH!  SAS don't know basketball.
He’s clearly never watched the Raptors before if he did he’d be ecstatic about the move, the guy lead the league in STL’s last szn while putting up 17pts a night this is a huge pick up for the Knicks and a good move for my Raptors going forward building around Scottie Barnes
Don't like those small back court guards in the playoffs And if we got Mitchell that what we would be Tibbs isn't coaching us to a championship 😳😳😳
This move helped them a lot financially specially if knicks were gonna lose quickly for free in summer anyway
Not a fan of the trade but lets see what happens🤷🏽‍♂️
Keeping IQ would not help them beat the Celtics or Milwaukee either.
It’s a trend in the right direction. Bigger is better for a Knicks team that’s mostly scrapping to get points.
I think the Knicks should trade for Derozen juat to add some scoring in the lineup.
Ok I’ll wait until next month when this man is parading around on national television yelling “we here”
Man Stephen A really don’t know basketball if he thinks having 2 ball dominant 6’1 guards in your backcourt is going to equal winning
Na Norman Powell should have been 6 man.    Be greatful SA.  Ya don’t make moves like that.
He wants teams to just give away players...😂😂😂
SAS is retarded.
SAS calling for a donavan mitchell trade shows he knows noyhing about basketball. Brunson is better than him, and plays WINNING basketball
we don’t accept stephen a as a knicks fan
Stephen A Smith is not going to be satisfied until he gets a dominant team that could actually win a championship a numerous amount of times.
Clownshow. How they look yesterday? Get some realism in here.
"and 2 other players"
Why do we still care about what Stephen A. Smith thinks
Coach thibs is the problem with the Knicks 😂😂😂
Im done listening to flip flopping sas i clearly remember him over a month ago saying everybody on the team is tradable because they not good players, now we hear i love iq they shouldn't have traded him? Also remember earlier in the season he said they should go after OG but now you not impress smdh im done clicking on anything Knicks with ESPN name next to it. This is crazy Knicks the only team in the league that get no respect winning or losing
I don’t think a backcourt of Donovan and Branson would work out to well
Sometimes I wonder how much of Knicks fan Stephen A. really is? He never has anything good to say about my team.
Did he watch the game last night?  Smh
Who cares SA..we want to trade u
Shut up Stephen! Fake Knick fan! You go against The Knicks for ratings!
They weren't gonna beat Boston or Milwaykee anyway lol
Bro is literally a bandwagon
Steven a smitty just makes a mockery of his job..hopefully those watching dont take him seriously
I don’t believe that the Knicks are done making moves, this seems like a first move to prepare for the next one. If they can add, not saying it’s going to happen, a talent like PG13, or Hayward with another shooter, they can definitely contend 💯
The Knicks should pair Randle & a couple 1st rd picks for.. literally any all star caliber player that wants a change of scenery.
Stephen A is like the grinch who stole Christmas, like he’s never satisfied with the Knicks. I wish they would put him in the FO for a day, he’ll fold like a chair 🤦🏾‍♀️🤣🤣🤣
i hate to say this but donovan Mitchell is overated, and cause of one reason only and that is steohen a making him like he's sone kind of revolutionary player, that will make the knicks comparable to the bucks or Boston, hell fckng no of they play those team the bucks and celtics still have the best player on the floor.
It feels like a lateral move. Does nothing imo. We still need a star
His takes are ridiculous
Knicks fans do not claim this 🤡
SASmith is right. I watched OG for years, and he can close down the other team's best, but he cannot create in the half court. Yes he can hit the three. This trade was to clear FWDs for the Raps, and Guards for the Knicks. A trade as a REAL first step for both teams, not in anyway the final step.
You only get a top 3 three and player in the league without giving up a 1st rounder for a backup PG and a third option.
Knicks need to trade for Donovan Mitchell finally
this is a better fit for them for the small forward position then Barrett. They are no longer undersized there,  and Donovan Mitchell with Jalen Brunson makes no sense because it'll make your backcourt to small.  Now they should go for another guard or wing player with OG whose a playmaker and can defend like a Dejounte Murray
Thibs is not the coach for the Knicks he’s playing these rotations like their superstars 😂😂😂😂
Do not do this…Donovan Mitchell is not the answer
SAS silly... as if Brunson and Mitchell are compatible....
Nobody wants New York's first round picks. They suck you've been trying to get rid of those things for three years now they have no value.
Donovan Mitchell is coming to the knicks that's pretty much a done deal from everyone I've listened to the last year so I'm not worried but this move was a great move now we have someone who can atleast slow down Tatum and Giannis.
He wants the ball more or you're never going to resign him... this is why Toronto had a problem with him. He wanted more offensive capability know if New York doesn't give it to him, bye-bye in the summer.
Shorty said “OR J Barrett “
Lol, SAS is obsessed with getting Mitchell but that's the most overrated star you can get. He will win you a few games and make you lose a couple with his hero-ball mentality.  If you are trying to get past Boston, you need a top 5 player and more, they are not gonna get any. Be realistic and try to be competitive in the playoffs, OG is the right move.
I hated to lose IQ but I like this trade. The other thing to consider is with OG’s defense (plus solid/efficient scoring), the Knicks won’t need to dig themselves out of a hole around the time IQ would normally come into the game.
Its a good move by the Knicks, but I agree with SA, come playoff time we are going to need another bonifide scoring threat to close out games.  I also get the pushback on Mitchell because of his size, but the ability to get a bucket from anywhere on the court, to me, is worth the risk.
At least OG moves without the ball. Would it kill Thibs to put some motion into the offense?? With that said, Dejuante would be a nice fit at the two for NYK.
SAS clearly doesn't understand basketball. He's fleeced ESPN and it's viewers for years now. Fire this man. For real.
Stephen A needs to MOVE his support to another team. If he wants to be moved.
They got better defensively and worse offensively. The logical next step is to add an offensive scoring guard. Fournier, mitchel Robinson and 5 first round picks for Donovan mitchel or zack Lavine?
That was a dumb trade!!!! They gave away quick!!!!🤦🏿
Dont ignore the fact that this trade made boyh teams involved better. This idea that a trade should be measured on its ability to let a team compete with the best is stupid, this is simply one of the moves a smart org make to get you closer.
Bad trade. We gave away our spark
The Knicks were not keeping IQ pass this summer and could have risked losing him for nothing.   They did IQ the same favor they did for Obi put him in the exact situation he wants to be in where he gets his bag and gets to start.
Stephen A don’t know much about bball.. Mitchell won’t move the needle at all, we need pieces around Brunson and Randle not another ball dominant guard unless he can play off ball.. we can just sign Mitchell when his contract is up instead of giving all our assets like we did for melo.. I wouldn’t give up everything for Mitchell but I would for booker.
He doesn't play he doesn't coach who cares smh
It's just a beginning for Leon Rose to wheel & deal in the trade market that shocked the NBA. He is not finished more work on the NY Knicks 🧡 roosters to become an elite team.
The fact that SAS thinks the Knicks need his approval and for him to co-sign all their moves is laughable. 🤡
SAS is the biggest Knicks hater out there…. and will jump on the bandwagon again when it’s going well. What happened to orange and blue skies? I see what game he’s playing though, bc we all know that when SAS sings your good graces it’s allllll downhill from there. LOVE using that reverse psychology; if SAS isn’t sold, EC FINALS BABYYYYYY
Stephen A should never be a GM, gives horrible team building advice, Mitchell is not the player the Knicks need.
Bamboozled, hoodwinked, led astray, etc etc
This is a %100 win trade for Knicks. U cannot build a contender while u have RJ or Randle in ur team. Knicks got rid of RJ without any frp and  now they should get rid of Randle with adding some frps and turning into a superstar. Brunson+OG+Superstar is core for a contender team.
I’ve had barbers with higher NBA IQ.
I dont even care about nottin'. Let me tell ya something. RJ BARRETT IS OUT OF NEW YORK CITY! He a bonafide scrub! That's the real win here.
As long as Stephen A is not on board we GOOD!!!
Stephen they just beat the best team in the league. What do you mean you’re not moved
Not sure how improved defense and offensive efficiency isn't something to be happy about. Keeping Quickly would have been great. However, chances are we would lose him at the end of the season when he hits the open market where he could get a big payday and start on another team and the front office was aware of this. That being stated, I would have preferred that we gave up RJ and first round pick. I mean we have 8 of them. Give them 2 for Christ sakes and perhaps if there was a deep playoff run Quickly sticks around. However, that still would be doubtful. Also, in OG debut they beat the best team in the West and have one the best wins of the season, but won't help them against top East teams?
Idk get how Sas bashes the Knicks on the number 1 sports channel every time he gets a chance but wants players to go There.
I watched that Knicks win yesterday against the team with the best record in the west. Anunoby is an upgrade over RJ Barrett. He’s not a more talented individual player but he’s more valuable in a team concept, especially defensively. I still don’t think the Knicks as presently constructed are a real contender, and I’m not sure they will be even if they get Donovan Mitchell, who I think all things considered is overrated as a #1 guy, but I think Stephen A is selling the addition of Anunoby a bit short. He is a good two-way player and I think they are better with him
Stephen A is the biggest fraud in any fanbase. Knicks fans DO NOT claim this man, he left a game in the 3rd quarter because he didnt believe in the Knicks and they won. I lost all the little respect I had left for him that day. Smh
StevenA would rather see Jericho sims than  IHeart who had 3 blocks on dunk attempts by Rudy golbert
This is agreat trade for both teams if OG signs (I think he will).  As a raptors fan I'm sad to see OG go, but he is gonna be good no matter where he goes.  No drama, hard worker, guy and wants to have an increased role, well here is his chance. RJ and Quickly, thank you for the young players. RJ is gonna be huge, watch. 😊 He is back home!!!
I live in Toronto I think we won the trade can't wait to see it in person
I agree that they should kept quickley but asking for donavan mitchel when you have Brunson is silly they should get either another wing or another big or a  3 and D guy Mitchel would be redundant
Obsessed with Mitchell, a guy whose never led a team anywhere!!
Knicks would be in a much better position if they had given up Grimes and Barrett for Donovan Mitchell.
Knicks and cavs both sit at 18-15 Utah is 15-19. I bet the jazz miss Rudy and spida now.  I dnt get why teams break up their core instead of being patient and building around them.
As a Knicks fan first thing first welcome to the Knicks og and let’s see what u bring to the Knicks.
Stephen A does not speak for Knicks fans.
Sas saying that Quickly is such a great player, when he hasn’t played well in the playoffs just as many times as Randle has... D Mitchell’s team doesn’t want to trade him so how can we get him?  Sas is not a real Knicks fan all he wants is a star player to brag about with his friends and co workers on a New York team.
He can guard Jimmy Dame Giannis Maxey Tatum Brown so that should be key . He is also just 26
Lol, this is best knicks trade in years
OG is a steady positive move… knicks playing great you don’t want anything crazy for now
Bro Who cares what SAS thinks🙄
OG is a good pick up
SAS did you watch that game? The whole team looked different. Grimes was playing free, hart was playing free, OG fit right in. I'm so excited after watching that game. We just need another point guard when brunson needs rest.
Yeah SAS, go ahead and trade the whole building for Donovan Mitchell 😂😂. Instead of getting murray. Murray can defend and is bigger and can play off ball. Then when Brunson goes to bench, you stagger minutes and let Dejounte run point. God SAS annoys me.
Remember when SAS was crying about RJ not being traded? This man doesn’t know ball
Who else better could they have gotten with quickly Steve?
SAS on Spida nut sack
Knicks better off trading for lauri markannen than trading for Donovan Mitchell Stephen a. Gotta stop crying for him he will be a Brooklyn net
me personally I'm not gonna go after a guy that everyone said would bounce the knicks out in the playoffs matter of fact sweep them then when the  face off happens he chokes and then they get bounced out in 5 no disrespect to Mitchell Big fan but i'm just saying
As a Raptor fan I definitely believe the Knicks got better. 3andD guy that is long, athletic, D’s up and can score points. He has played big games for Toronto too!
Doesn't SAS remember that the Knicks eliminated Mitchell last season in the playoffs? What the hell is he smoking this time?
🤣😂😂🤣🤣
THIS O G GUY DOES NOT TAKE THE KNICKS TO THE PROMISE LAND THE KNICKS REMAIN PRETENDERS.
One game but you cant deny everybody was on the court playing defense. Like OG he wants to be the captain on defense. Even Randle was defending towns tough. But were gonna gloss over that. Also i feel it lessens the burden on grimes. He can think a lot more on the offensive end. Why trade all these 1st for mitchell when you can just sign him. We have a lot of money coming off the books. Then you can make other necessary trades.
If they would have kept IQ at least I would have been cool. Cause Brunson Mitch OG and unfortunately randle ain’t a bad 4 I would trade him tho if he don’t show up in the playoffs again.
Knicks is the worst team ever in sports history same with the fans 🤡
It's a step in the right direction. I don't think Stephen A even watches basketball. He doesn't have time with having to carry ESPN on his narrow shoulders 😅😅😅
This is why SAS is a talking head on TV and not in an NBA front office. Last season, he showed that his judgement on trades and transactions involving the Knicks is not only flawed but utterly ridiculous. This is the same guy that said we should have mortgage our whole team for Donovan Mitchell. He’s good he’s not moving the needle.   Most REAL Knick fans were happy the Mitchell trade was not done and understood why that trade wasn’t done. I appreciate so far the competence the Knicks front office is showing. The Knicks are being prudent and not irrationally making moves simply because of a big name. SAS’s basketball acumen stinks lately especially when it comes to the Knicks.
Any chance the Knicks are preparing to make a deal for Mitchell this season? Mitchell, Brunson and OG is a trio that could make it a bit more interesting in the East to say the least.
L O S E R take
Sas, just another loud mouth with an opinion and you know what they say about opinions 😂😂😂❤❤❤
Hard to become a contender with one single move. It's a series of good moves. This was certainly a good move
Idk why ESPN continue to market this man as if he’s a ride or die fan when he’s just a casual.
Jalen Bronson been good though
SAS is a 🤡
SAS is a fake Knicks fan and a clown 🤡
Why does the media always insist that Knicks make some Blockbuster Superstar Trade that ultimately guts the team of Picks and Players.  This is how you get better… incrementally and not overnight 🤦🏿‍♂️
The cowboys hasn't won in over 25 years and stephan A goes hard at then all the time.  The Knicks hasn't won in over 50 years and he's so into them every season lol.  😂
Knicks still need to move Randle. Markkanen would be a much better fit
Mitchell going to Philly 😊
We need a new generation of analyst skip and smith talk from a fan point of view no facts at all
*Trade Stephen A to the Detroit Pistons. Who cares what this dude thinks about the Knicks*
I know it will never happen, but I wish the Knicks would make SAS their GM.  The moronic moves he would make would make form GM Isiah Thomas look like a genius!
Stephen A knows less about Basketball than most of the people in the comment section
SAS speaking facts. I wasn’t the happiest with them getting rid of quickley 😒
@ 0:51 😁😁 Well.. you lost him.
SAS don't EVER be a coach lol
I remember a team that threw the farm away for three players and when they did those said three players left after 2 seasons and now that player that the threw the farm away for plays in boston
They don’t Spider they need to get rid of Randle and get KAT. I think in that system surrounded by dawgs I think he can Flourish
Rj Barrett is home 🏡 there is no place like home
Stephen A. Wants a big name player, but doesn't realize that defensively we will get punished with two small guards, Dejounte is an all-star and would be a better fit because he is 6'5 and plays defense. Dejounte is Also a bucket getter and a third option in regards to getting buckets.
I'm upset with the trade. I liked Quickly.
All facts but there is no one that guarantees anything
They could’ve got Pascal with that package 😂
"Og Anunoobie"
in addition to being more defensively sound competitor, NYK is now also a ~$30M step in salary closer to landing that piece SAS bemoans them not having - piece by piece, step by step... them chains moving, yall - woohoo! Sincerely, an RJ fan!
I disagree if Mitchell Robinson didn't get injured we would be a hard out in the east , but that will have to wait until next year I guess , this move was a stepping stone to other moves and next year Is when I really feel like the Knicks will be top dawgs
This MFer is CORNYYYYYY he doesn’t speak for the fans
He realizes OG is a top 5 wing/forward defender right?
Stop saying Stephen A.'s Knicks, he is a fake fan!
Do not get Mitchell he will definitely messed up the chemistry he doesn't pass the ball
Stephen A wont be satisfied until the Knicks trade for Jesus.  He tripping, the Knicks are better because of this trade.  Quickly was not going to stay a Knick, he going to Philadelphia to play with his buddy. This is just a step in the right direction.  The Knicks now need a player like DeRozan. A real dog that can score at all levels and can hit the big shot.  Swap expiring contracts with Chicago and a pick and lets go!
Knicks complete inability to build through the draft is a death sentence
Ahhh  shut up
Stephen A hates anything from Canada
Steven A doesn’t understand that this is a wings league 2 small guards don’t win in the playoffs
Daily reminder that Stephen A isn't a real Knicks fan
Stephen a is a bozo.. we wouldn't be able to keep quickley regardless, I mean you can knock the trade but quickley was gone regardless.
Brunson and Mitchell are the same player. Mitchell being more atheletic and Brunson being more crafty and clutch but the same tier player... That would be a bad pairing cuz neither are good defenders and the back court would be severely undersized
Stephen A Smith still wants Damian Lillard 😂😂
Tell Stephen to resign in his post as an NBA analyst and play for the Knicks maybe he could help them reach the NBA finals 'coz his mouth is bigger than basketball. Stephen Smith doesn't know nothing but forecasting negative news to let us believe that whatever he's talking is right. Another useless ESPN analyst. Fire that useless guy.
STOP SAYING SAS’ KNICKS!  HE’S NOT A FAN!!
Y’all remember earlier this season when we were facing the Heat in the IST, and we went down by twenty? SAS left, and then we came back to win lol.
Woman, you're on a Sports Show yes?  His name is AnUnOby, not AnunUby. Jezzz!
Why did i even come here…what a crock of shyte mark my words your wrong
still way better than rj, specially defensively OG is consistent and reliable 3 point shooter, barret needs the ball to effect the game, he plays like brunson but inefficient way, dominates the ball and plays no defense
If the Knicks get Mitchell, SAS will do a cartwheel into the studio.
There’s no star player available that’s going to make a huge change for any middle of the pack team.  MAYBE you can get Lavine or a DeRozan from the Bulls.  But I don’t see that being a huge bump either.
Literally picked up a great young two-way player.  Cmon Knicks are not a team where they can sign big name stars anymore.  Take steps to get better.
SAS is wrong about OG: the guy is way more than a 3&D player.  He can score in the paint and the perimeter, especially as a third option if given the opportunity to.  Every year he’s been adding wrinkles to his offensive game while he’s been a beast defensively.
Why do we even give this man any attention?  He obviously doesn’t know basketball and/or doesn’t watch games.  All he asks for is for knicks to sign a “Superstar”.  Basically, do the same thing that Knicks did to get Melo and set the team back years.  What a 🤡
if josh hart is going to be the backup pg like how he was gonna be before than losing quickley wont be too bad. but the mcbride minutes were bad not sure if he could be the backup pg
Stephen A is the reason why the knicks get hated lmfao. ESPN pushes this agenda of "haha knicks bad"
SAS is dumb when it comes to the knicks
He actually made some decent points for once but then goes back on his Mitchell nonsense. How does having a backcourt of two 6ft guards who don’t play defence move the needle?
WELCOME HOME RJ BARRETT 🇨🇦
Stephen A is the typical delusional fan always worried about a big name instead of what makes sense. Two small guards that don't play defense is a disaster waiting to happen. Murray is the better fit. Imagine a starting 5 of 3 former allstars in their prime and two of them being all defensive players.
They can get probably a vet to replace quickly's position.  I really think John Wall can be a great addition if he agrees to come out from the bench.
Oh please, Stephen A is delusional because he just wanted the Knicks to gut their entire roster for Mitchell. Knicks fanbase has disowned Stephen A a long time ago.
I’m predicting now. RJ is going to be someone to watch out for in Toronto in a few years
Molly needs to say his name right
Stephen A Smith talks like a man who does not like the Knicks.  Which is fine except he the proclaims to be a Knicks fan, while advocating for them to do things that would make them unlikable and worse off.
stop calling them “his” knicks, not a fan of
remember knicks fans, this is the same 🤡 that said the lakers are going to win this years chip, just focus on making og flourish in the system , dont listen to a guy that dosent even know what he is saying😝
He does make a good point about Thibs running JB and Randle into the ground potentially now. That will suck. He keeps riding this Spida train but if you make a deal like that, we're gonna have a backcourt of midgets that score the basketball with ease but they will get absolutely destroyed on the other end.
This guys a clown
I mean he’s right that the trade doesn’t move the needle currently for Knicks contending for a title. But, I think it’s a step in the right direction since Knicks can focus on depth, rather than splurging for a star that would remove any depth from the lineup.
Lakers could use OG
They should have pulled off that RJ to OG straight up but raptors aint budging
OG is not a game changer what so ever 🤣
He makes the worse Knicks take ever
This dude Stephen A is never satisfied, hello the Knicks are horrible in the paint defensively, this kid will improve that ,you think Garrett was doing that ,  trade all your picks for what ,
SA never advocated for IQ now he is talking about how he doesnt like it.  SA please let us know what you actually like instead of talking Donovan Mitchell all day long.
Stephen A speaks like a casual. OG is the real deal
Relax Steven Q is not a starter his off the bench player who chucks
That dude from raptors is huge lol
Is nothing 😂😂😂
Trash 🗑️🗑️🗑️
y'all watch Stephen a just to hate weirdos
As long as SAS talks smack about us we good.. It's when he praises us is when we need to worry fr fr..
Meanwhile they beat the Timberwolves.  You can’t have Quickley and Brunson on the court at the same time.
the knicks are doomed for at least another decade
SAS is an idiot... The trade puts them in the right direction and getting Mitchell would only set the franchise back. I don't get why he is so obsessed with getting a 6 2 guard to pair with Brunson. Mitchell is undersized and any advantage they would gain offensively with Mitchell would not be able to offset the hit to their defense.
OG shoots three better than Barrett. Defends better and does not need the ball as much. He will cost less too
Stephen A. Needs to take a trip to "Shuttyville". It's nice and quiet there.
Knicks need to go after klay thompson
I agree with sas. They shouldn't get rid of quickley. Should of been Barrett and grimes
Bring in mitchell to pair with Brunson and Randle who also need the ball in their hands to score? Sounds like a disaster
Is this really the best deal Toronto could get?
Typical bluster.
PLEASE ESPN FIRE STEVEN A SMITH. This guy really doesn’t know basketball
It was a good trade for both teams he trippin
The star player the Knicks need to be targeting to go all in on is Devon Booker.  Whatever is going on in Phoenix is getting really ugly really fast and Booker-A CAA client- would probably put the Knicks at the top of his list of preferred destinations if he ever asks out.  He’s a much better pairing next to Brunson specifically on defense than Mitchell.
This network continues the negative rhetoric towards this team no matter what the knicks do..why is Shannon Luther king laughing..so knick fans are not supposed enjoy their team cause this 4 letter hateful network continues to bash them at their finest moments... they call this sports reporting?
He won his 1st game as a Knick, Randell dropped 40, & this dude is still not happy Lol. Knicks are better. RJ Barrett was the problem
Ok bozo. Fraud fan anyways
Bumass scrub Molly with that Anunooby
SAS can really be clueless at times, IQ didn’t get the extension he wanted from the Knicks therefore would have probably gone elsewhere anyway at some point the Knicks trade him for something vs losing him via free agency.
I'm convinced Steven A hates the knicks and does not know what he's talking about
IQ is on the last year of his deal and is looking to start as well as get paid starters money. Because of Jalen Brunson, those things were never going to happen for him in a Knicks jersey. That's why he was in the deal. OG fits way better with what the Knicks do than RJ Barrett. Also, they didn't give up a 1st round pick to make this deal happen. Great trade for the Knicks.
I dont know about wanting to pay OG this offseason but it made them better and they still have assets if they want to make another over. SAS is emotional. Its not a HR move. This is like a double and in position. BIG name star didnt havnt worked for them. Build the team carefully
sas obvisoly just says what his people tell him too bc thinking spida or quickely could work together in the playoffs w brunson is retarded. u dont want a small backcourt that cant defend. they didnt want to pay quickly and thats why they traded him. lmao this should be common knowledge for ppl like him 😂
Knicks are about to explode, only thing holding them back now is Mitchell's injury, if he could come back early that defense will be solidified. The bench needs a pg to step up tho
We got somebody that can guard the best players in the league effectively which is most important in the playoffs. Not a final piece but a very important one
Knicks are mid let's go Celtics!
Getting OG helps the Knicks defensively and efficiency wise with his ability to make a three, but it doesn't get them closer to Boston or Milwaukee. Quickley was a great guy off the bench. Hate to see him go, but I noticed he's now starting for Toronto, so it's great for him getting a bigger role.
i have to agree with immanuel being traded shouldve been avoided. but og is still a better and also a young player. he is also a good defender so i think this trade works just fine for knicks
Stephen A does not really watch the Knicks.
Getting Donovan puts them back in my opinion. He’s another player that needs the ball taking other players out of rhythm. If Mitchell Robinson was able to stretch teams out on offense then they would be fine.
Yea this does nothing for me. Solid player but that’s it. Good move for sure
i think SAS talks sooo much that he hardly has time to even listen to what he says lol
I wonder if the Utah Jazz are going to be Sellers at the deadline this season and are interested in a trade centered on heavy draft capital?  If so, then Lauri Markkanen (another solid scorer with size) and Jordan Clarkson (back up PG) would really move the Knicks to the top tier in the East with the Celtics, Bucks and 76ers.  I wonder if it is possible for Mitchell Robinson to come back in time for the playoffs to really solidify the roster?
I WANT Alex Caruso
Did he not watch the game
OG trade was the move before the move. We'll miss him in T.O. That said, SAS is absolutely right, this Knicks roster is better but still doesnt have that #1 guy that you can look at and think will take you to the promised land.  Also, the rumours on OG taking a pay cut to stay with NYK are laughable, he's been a DPOY candidate and what do you think will happen to his value being in the MSG spotlight, especially if he has a strong run in the playoffs?
Stephen A has the mindset of the Knicks’ old moronic FOs: names matter more than actual fit. The Knicks desperately needed a guy like OG, and watching how he defended vs Minnesota yesterday, he’s the exact opposite. Not a huge star name, but an absolutely perfect fit.
Stephen A and Shannon have become the clown car show. Silly take, great trade for both teams.
OG AnahNoobie
You think now that OG Anunoby is no longer in Toronto ESPN will actually learn to say his name and stop call him "Anobee"?
"I'm not moved" after they just beat the best team in the West with Jalen Brunson shooting terribly....
REALLY.. Stephen A is the voice of the Knicks. Let's be real, he'll never be happy til they throw everything away to get a big name star or two. He didn't like Brunson, until he gave the a playoff push. So let the folks who actually make the decisons make the decisions.
There have been 2 small guards to lead there teams to championships in the past 35 years, Isaiah and Steph. AI couldn’t even do it. What makes you think Donovan Mitchell can? I’m confused SA.
lol I don’t think the Knicks care if Stephen a is not moved by the trade who is he
This trade helps the Knicks start moving in the right direction it is by no means the end of their building.
Stephen a… the knicks couldn’t care how you feel with your mountainside shape up. I can’t wait till someone smacks him he been real pepper in his step of late 😂.
Stephen A's man crush on Mitchell is nauseating.
Stephen A wont be happy with his knicks unless they trade for curry lebron and embiidd all at once 😭
Anunooby. Ok mooly
Sick of this lame fan always complaining.
Getting Dejounte Murray makes a lot more sense than getting Spida.
I feel like the Knicks are better now, Anunoby brings some slick toughness.
Stephen A annoys TF out of me.. can't for the life of me understand why he has such a strong following...
Finalllyyy we have been waiting 😂😂
Stephen A is so illiterate on basketball that he is hiding his ignorance by raising his voice.  Anunoby is 10 times the upgrade of Donovan Mitchell.  Knicks are so fortunate to get this trade. If Mitchell played last night, I guarantee you Stephen A.  The Knicks will have a field day running plays against an undersized guard in Donovan as compared to how OG Onunoby delivered last night against Minnesota.   When Stephen A opens his mouth, I cringe!  Today I cringed even harder LOL.
Love Donovan Mitchell, but I rather see him in Brooklyn. Brunson and Mitchell will be the smallest backcourt that will be hard to defend. Murray plays defense better..
Can we stop already with the donovan mitchell and obi toppin talk its old now you guys make it seem like donovan mitchell was in the w.c.f every year in crucial game 7s against l.a houston and golden state its not the case those jazz teams in my opinion are better constructed then the current knicks team so what would getting him do stop focusing on the name focus on the process and what we have
Who cares on what Stephen A Smith has to say. Go Knicks!
Why would it be crazy to trade for mikal right now? Make an offer the nets cant refuse
OG is great but not at 40mil a year which he is asking for.
Tell me your a clown without telling me your a clown
Even if you get Donavan Mitchell, he still won’t make them top 3 in the East.
Stephen A. Smith is more of a cowboys fan losing than being a Knicks fan..
SAS and his good Old Tunnel Vision gotta love it 😂
Brunson and Mitchell backcourt doesn't work
I hate this guy as a fan . Just be a lakers fan bro . We don’t want you here
Maybe a person like spike Lee who holds season tickets every year for the Knicks.., should be the be one who is or not moved...
trade julius randle
Don’t pay attention to SAS. He’s not a real NY fan like he puts on. He’s obsessed with Donovan Mitchell because he’s “box office” never mind winning. They was gonna lose IQ regardless and Thibs rotation was like ten deep. The scoring from IQ was made up by Donte which he enforces to mention. Donte avg like 27 PPG since the trade. They scored 112 against the #1 scoring defense with a terrible game from Brunson. They’ll be fine offensively.
This trade helps balance out both teams.   Knicks get a 3 & d wing, and clear a log jam at guard.   Raptors get a starting forward and guard who you can build with.   Incremental improvements is the way to build. The microwave trade doesnt work like in years past. You need a team not just stars.
How’re Donovan and Brunson gonna play together Stephen?
Thankyou knicks for quickly we need a faster team and we got it
He's a fake knicks fan.  Enough of this clown
Before we make our next trade we should call Steph A and see if he approve?!? F that guy, fake Knicks fan!
They may not win it all but they definitely improved
🤡 take
Stephen A thinks that you always need to trade for a top 10 player. Look at Aaron Gordon and Bruce Brown. Two solid pieces that helped Denver win the championship. Those type of players are sometimes more valuable than a big name that doesn’t fit the system
We still are in need of another option to score. Julius has not proved himself to be good in the playoffs no matter how well he plays in the season. Also i agree, getting rid of Quickley puts even more pressure on Jalen brunson. He needs some help now more than ever
Stephen once again proves he doesn’t watch Knick games, do Knicks fans a favor and root for the lakers or heat…
Were still asking fake fan SAS his take?
this guys a jinx dont let him near the team
Stephen A is idiot undersized backcourts  ain’t going to get done
Knicks should keep the picks and be the new Thunder in 5 years no matter who they trade for they ain’t winning anytime soon build for the future
It's a good pick up what is SAS talking about.
So, get Donovan Mitchell to add to this group. You tell me, SAS, how that’s going to work with the cap. Brunson is going to get a payout,OG is a free agent after this year and Randall will also get a big payout on his next contract the way he has played the last 6 weeks. SAS and his Mitchell obsession- JB outplayed him in last year’s playoffs. We need a taller shooting guard who can play d and shoot the 3  ( unless you think the big ragu is that guy) and a back up point guard ( unless Duece shows he can do it). Not another ball dominant player. We just had that issue with RJ JB and JR.
Stephen A is a bonafide casual 🤣 He says things just for clicks
Steven a not even a real knicks fan
Stephen A knows nothing about 🏀
What about the Raptors perspective? This was a Knicks take. Does this trade work for Raptors?
But yesterday they DID win best team in the nba at the moment and with the worst Jalen game possible. So the next game might show more.
IQ is so over hyped.  The guy can score, sure, but he's not gonna be one of the top two players on a deep playoff team.  These guys are acting like he's Steph or something.  This is coming from a Knicks fan who watches all their games, he definitely needed to be moved since Brunson is clearly a better scorer.
Ole Ludacris doppelganger Steven A. ain't happy unless its someone HE hyped up so he can come on and pat himself on the back..
We Knicks fan dis like  you and your shapeup mr smith big mouth self
Stephen A be like go and throw the farm away for an undersized guard that won’t pair well with Brunson who also never made it past the second round that we beat last year smh
Quickley was the best player in this trade 😭😭
This trade wasn’t intended to put us at the top of the East… it’s simply a step in that direction. Relax.
Fans like SAS hold the Knicks organization back, people think you need to always trade for the big name look at the suns right now
If I've said it once I've said it a thousand times, Donovan Mitchell will not drastically move the needle for the Knicks. We're gonna trade picks and depth to bring in a guy that couldn't will his team past us last season? To bring in a #1 option that got bounced by our current #1 two years in a row? C'mon man
Knicks been sorry since 1999
No one can say OG's name properly... what a joke lmao
#1 hater
Stephen A won’t be satisfied until the Knicks trade 5 picks for a big name that won’t actually get them past the second round.
Glad to see you guys back
Casual knicks trade they’ll never get a superstar it just won’t happen
