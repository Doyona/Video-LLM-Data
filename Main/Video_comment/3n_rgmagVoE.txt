NOTIFICATION SQUAD: Don't deny it. You wanted to see Ryotaro get run over by the patronisingly slow self-driving cart as much as I did. A MASSIVE thank you to you all for tuning into the Abroad in Japan channel - whether you're new here and are still wondering who the hell we are, or have been watching since the dawn of time (which is 2012). I never thought we'd make it this far and I'm hoping we can do something extra special in 2021! Bring on some serious "pork tactics." (Seriously though, how does Ryotaro invent these phrases?!).
Had dreams the other night since I'm from apple country in my country. Premium apples just grow on the road side in busy traffic. Zero effort. I'm southern now and I miss it. I miss snow and apples
3:30 I'm sure that water is INCREDIBLY delicious and cold like bottled srping water but uh.... he's not gonna get Giardia..... right?
Thanks for helping me delude myself into thinking that I'm not drinking alone Chris
Ahhh, snow on rice paddy, very Japanese lol
Your friends really do add a lot to your videos, by the way.  They make Japan seem so much more inviting, socially, than I have always imagined it in my mind.
Why can't Ryotaro drink much?  Is it s health thing?  I guess I haven't seen the videos where you guys talk about it.
the cart game refference would be half life ??
"who would get drunk in a forrest"  every scottish wain laughed at  that
Yup.... Nagai-san has won at life. And that tonkatsu, I think it made me gain a half a pound just sitting here watching it.
3:29 c'mon Chris 😭we both know that water has little critters swimming inside if you use a microscope
Since my only exposure to Japanese hot spring culture is JAV, I was very disappointed.
Woah, I never realized you went to Otone Brewery! I'm currently living in Gunma as an ALT and about 15 of us all got the opportunity to visit there and learn about how sake is make just this last month. I'd love to see you explore more of Gunma, as before coming here I'd never heard much of the prefecture, but it truly is the greatest hidden treasure in the Kanto region!
Ryotaro with the Evita solo on the balcony was perfection
Congrats! I enjoy every show! What sets you apart,is your "teacher mentality", teaching me,and others,about Japan. Well done,I know a lot of research goes on behind the scenes,clips. Thank you!
Pork Katsu made me drool
I appreciate the unique relationship he has with all the different members of the gang. Even Ryataro lol
Loved everything about the video especially the banter between you both xx
I noticed they placed the raw pork in crumbs from a large draw which would get used over and over again. This is a breeding ground for germs/illness.  Maybe it is one batch of crumbs for the night....anyone loving Japan and hoping to get their very soon. Your videos are fantastic
13:44 LOL
The hot  spring
Peak Abroad in Japan ❤❤❤
This was such a good video! You two having fun in luxury, so lovely
17:45 Me as a german is suprised to see that they call it Weizen.^^
Ryotaro was the highlight of this video for me.
bet its way better than those poised animals they feed is in america
Nagai is DRIPPED holy shit
Ryotoro is slightly drunk 🤭 and Cris is just playing along till Ryotoro’s slight hangover is over. I wonder if he was laughing after watching the video?
Karasutengu?
It's great... Years of eating with friends I know, I'm the one lefty of the group, and every time we never sit so we're not bumping into each other. Glad it's not just me
Ryotaro about to hit cha with the po-pork tactics!
man that tonkatsu looked good!!!
You can say the word cute, Chris!
Be nice to Ryotaro dammit, lol, i have been binging all your videos over the last few weeks my dude, you do a great job, much love from Australia
if there's an INN, maybe there's an OUTT :D
Great video
ive stayed at a 250$ hotel before (discount i paid 90). it wasnt anything like this. and the place i was had 1000$ rooms. im a bit mad. i want my money back.
Why are all the in room onsen always over flowing?
I could see Chris making either a dating book or a dating gameshow called Pork Tactics
Matching tops and mutual respect 🙃 Two handsome men
Chris board? was Ryotaro calling you a plank! how rude Ha Ha!
Mannn, I reckon the guys who run those tonkatsu joints would be able to make a mean crumbed lamb cutlet...
Drunk Ryotaro is best Ryotaro.
How the hell can that guy drink sake everyday and not have that beer belly? I've been on 4oz to 8 oz of wine daily and can't match his thinness. I hate him. Dang it.
The two of you together works really well as a way of exploring Japan. The straight guy and the crazy comedy guy is a good match for the channel.
2 mil subs in this video
no wooden cup ?
i love pork tactics
Very fun video. Saki brings out the best in good friends. Chris don't ever seriously piss off Ryotoro as he may seriously 'bite your head off'! ... 😯
cooment!!
Ryotaro has a bit of a British accent when he speaks English, I think that is very funny, just a side effect of who he normally interacts with in english.
Like Gordon Freeman riding the tram through Black Mesa.... or a D-day cutscene in a WW2 game. Not very close examples to your auto-cart ride 😂 but those are what came to mind for me when you mentioned video game intros.
1:15
10:34 "Hey you, you're finally awake"
17:00 Connor single tear drop💧
Ryotaro looks like the Japanese version of my therapist.
Japan, you are great, but tonkatsu is just a badly prepared nicely dressed schnitzel
Just remember to pee downstream
Good god! The tonkasu is on my bucket list!
Tonkatsu and the bath!!
13:07 I'm 230 pounds and I can jump better than that LOL
What’s Chris’s issue with Ryotaro? He seems like a good guy
As a german, I have to say the local beer is the best. But as a Japan Fan, I have to say the local sake is my favourite. Yes, I love alcohol aswell
Why did Ryatoro's English get better when after got drunk lmfao
Freaking bringing a smile to my face.  Thanks for these awesome vids.
Your videos are an excellent brain lozenges. Soothing for an irritated, inflamed mind.
Does ryotaro have a youtube channel? You mentioned he does but its not linked in the description 😭 #pain
i wanna try the sake
Board
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼😋😋🤣👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼🤣🤣🤣
real
Ryotaro's laugh is so catchy that when he starts to laugh i can't contain my self and laugh with him 😂 and when you Chris explain the everything in particular i want to see more and learn more about that deliciously looking food places
Ryotaro is SO CUTE!!! 😔✨✨
don't believe the analytics, the videos with risottoro are the best!
Thích những người bên đạo dậy đàn hay như vậy:)).
For me as a german its so sureal, seeing you travel so far, only to see you eating japanese schnitzel..
I hope in every video to hear japanese. Im learning portugese while speaking spanish and its so much harder than japanese.
Hmm...Sometimes the two of you are kind of shocking in your treatment of each other 😅. You must be good friends to get away with it. You both are funny together. Just a thought- Why doesn't Ryotaro have a channel of his own? He seems to have much to say and he seems to want to share with people, in front of the camera. I've only recently subbed to your channel, after watching off and on for a while, and I always get a laugh at the nutty things you end up doing. Keep having so much fun with your channel.
He's even in the emoji 👺
Loved the intro music
i want to try pork tactics
Almost 3M now ☺
I thought you are calling him "Realtor" ahahaha
Why the hell do you wear face diapers? Esp. if you already travel closely each other without them?
Ryotaro looked like a very typical drunk person in this video lol.
I feel like these hotels should be more drunk Ryotaro proof with all the sake around.
man i love your vidoes, i know we could drink a beer and hangout for sure !
"Don't cry for me Argentina" loll. So great to see Japanese being so expressive :)
Well. It tastes like ar... m..m.. water.
Is that Rabbit and Moon covered wine also in Drops of God?
the view looks awesome with the snow
Was quite pleased to find a bottle of Nagai Mizubasho sake at my local Asian market in the US just now. Excited to try it
Ryotaro is like your annoying uncle that you don’t mind he is there after you get used to him because he is like your family.
Bruh... How did you not hit: Chris Bored?
Just noticed this video debuted on my birthday. Think its a sign that this Ryokan and Sake brewery will have to be on my itinerary for my Japan trip. Everything looked great and lots of fun
I found this tiny youtuber thanks to the amazing Ryotaro. Thank you Ryotaro for carrying this channel on your shoulders.
I really like Ryotaro
"You are transported to your room by a selfdriving cart"  Has flashbacks of Resident Evil 4
Drinking from a stream seems so surreal!
Ryotaro the Movie but it´s filmed in Argentina
10:34 definitely like Skyrim
Snow melt, deer pee, fish pee. Its all good. Didnt feel any after effectsa at all.
Ryotaro is the MAN!
This channel deserves more subscribers FR. I'm like watching a documentary in all of the travel videos here. Superb! 👌🏻
This way of making pork is my favorite. Thank you for sharing.
I just want to order all that sake here to Canada! Ugh!
2 words! Pork Tactics
Awww you guys are so cute all matchy matchy in your long sleeved black shirts
Algorithm
Always good,always funny and good surprises.
Drinking from the spring but about 200m away a deer just peed in it . ;)
I thought for sure at 4:20 there was a dead bird on a rock out of that stream you guys were drinking out of lol
"By getting drunk in a forest" 😂🙏💯
One the best episode ❤️ 🙌 💕
I want to try that pork.
Ryotoro looks like cracking company!
That water has a ton of microbes man
0:18   Ah yes Ryo-Tengu
Ryotaro slightly drunk hyper mode activates ! xD
This all looks like the most beautiful dream i could ever have <3
Was stationed in Hawai'i for four years.  Katsu was sold _everywhere_ there, and you know what? It was pretty fucking good.  Hard to mess up fried food, though.
What we don't realise is that Ryotaro is the big bad in Far Cry 7
"How much alcohol did you guys drink in this video?"     "YEs"
Risottoro is fucking smashed after a few drinks, love it.
you deserve more subs chris
Spending a week in a Japanese hot spring while cuddling golden retrievers can definitely cure depression. :]
👺
This channel always gets me so very hungry
I am sorry, I love ur videos, but I'm going to throw up...
The alcohol made this video so much better and it was already great 😆
Ryotaro Sama and Natsuki Sama are always worth watching.
Note to self: Sample the "pretty trippy" at 18:00 to add to the psytrance track.
I'm just here for Ryotaro.
Loved it all but especially drinking both the pure water and the sake in the forest, and seeing Ryotoro "slightly" hammered - lol!  In Australia we either say that you're a 'Cadbury' (can only handle a glass and a half) or my favourite, a 'two pot screamer'. As someone who is a lightweight when it comes to alcohol, I can completely sympathise with Ryotoro.  My friends have strict instructions not to let me drink before 11pm on New Years Eve because I wipe myself out and have to go home to sleep before 10pm (happened too many times).
The thing that oddly stuck with me in this video was the automatic sliding wooden doors.  They can be made with any material you want, I guess, but they're always made with glass. Seeing some wooden doors just slide open on their own at the ryokan just made me stop the the video and go back because...huh.
Okay, Ryotaro is a fine ass man!
Meal costs are separated or included? If they are included then it's great deal for 250%
Id love to taste the water.
He was more drunk that human
Congrats on 2M.
A Board in Japan
Slightly drunk Ryotaro improved my viewing experience by at least 50% if not more.
17:13 Ryotaro is so pissed, he's playing with Chris's sardine. Is that a new game+ item or something?
Inebriated Ryotaro is much more at ease and pleasant than machismo Ryotaro.
give the sake maker 5 stars for service, how old is the inn
I had some battered but otherwise raw Tonkatsu at a really popular place in Japan. It was absolutely amazing! But can't remember where it was? 🤔
ryotaro being bullied in the intro?? gonna be a great video
Always fucjing place
Not gonna lie, I envy the friendship of chris, ryotaro, and natsuki.
Drunk Risotto is Dee best!!
Watching your show truly makes me feel like I'm reading a super indepth book that  allows me to escape my reality and just enjoy watching pure bliss of You, Natsuki, Royotaro, dr Jelly guy just having fun respectfully, and still have a plethora of educational gains about Japan and its beautiful culture.
Oh, a Weizen. A very wise choice. Ryotaros state reminds me of when I was in a Kölsch Kneipe in Cologne where Japanese businessmen were celebrating in the basement dancing on the tables.
This looks like the perfect place to spend a winter in
So pretty forest and stream.
Chris.  Don't be such a dick to your friends who appear in your videos please.
You guys are a funny combo ! :)
This channel brings me joy.
Adding to my dream kitchen wish list: a drawer full of Panko breadcrumbs.
👺👺👺👺
There are 2 villans in the abroad in japan
👺
Ryotaro sorta has a british accent, or is that just me?
!!!!
Well done, Ryotaro on gaining this many followers on board in Japan
He is a light sleeper as they say in America.  It is easy to wake him up and it can be hard for him to fall asleep with external noises.  He offers hope for future travelers.
Chris borned with a name that will brand well
That pork dish looked incredible
Zamn. That river water 💦 looks so good 😋
:))
Yep, Gunma has alot of nice onsen hotels (ryokans). One thing to note: The ryokan in the video (Yutorian) is $250 PER PERSON. And like many ryokans, there's a 2 person minimum -- a bummer for solo travellers! :(
chris gained again weight
Congratulations! 2 million, very impressive.  Go for 4. Keep it going.
I like the drunk Roytaro more😆😆
Well I'd be glad if every YouTuber gets no ads, because ads are getting quite disgusting as of late
If i had to pay, for those video it would be a good "cost performance"
By The Way, I love Ryotaro!
We need more drunk Ryotaro to be quite honest
Dang, that tonkatsu...so mouthwatering
Never knew Chris was a leftie! My wife and I are both lefties too -  Sadly, us lefties die earlier than other people lol 😔
"...appreciating the connection between sake and nature, by getting drunk in a forest..."  this quote describes this channel perfectly, and I love it
drinking spring water with the homies
Prepare yourself chris, because ryotaro is celebrating you😂😂🤣😂 he treated you so well all day, he liked you , give him back pleasures he wanted😂😂🤣🤣
Just found your channel and can't stop watching it... I must admit, Ryotaro  is really cool .. I think  I still have about 100 videos left to watch..  Keep up the fantastic work.. :o)
OH my Chris is handsome
What’s that intro music called?
AGUANTE EVITA VIEJA NO ME IMPORTA NADA
What's the temperature of the sake? Not 49, not 47, it's exactly 48 degree....that's how precise Japanese waitress are.
Slightly drunk :D
“Slightly drunk” can we see really drunk?
I’m super confused… what did $250 buy?
i want to try evrything
I love how Ryotaro is like a golden retriever: Showering Chris with love and good food to show friendship And Chris is like a cat: The more he's dismissive and acts like he doesn't care, the more he actually cares xD
@team chris
I can tell just from looking at this, filming must be awkward af, even when you're with good ole risottoro he looks back at you to keep the convo flowing but you have to stare at this big camera instead and talk towards it.
oh no chris is wrong handed lol
Ryotaro   Ryotaro   Ryotaro !!!!!
Ryotaro has so much sauce god damn
Ryotaro-sama for the win.
Ryotaro looks like a middle aged respectable arcitect, and acts like a drunk 18 year old on a gap year. I love him!
If I came here I’d go straight to pork tactics
Ryotaro is the coolest!!
I would do everything u guys did, looks like a perfect day to me....PORK TACTICS!!!
Hotel on point. Food on point. Sake on point     Bromance on point.
ryotaroさんは可愛いすぎる！
The wicked shoemaker unfortunately injure because candle analytically follow until a earsplitting can. slow, befitting preface
🍶
I dont get it why Japanese people live in those 10m+ cities in shoe box size apartments and working 12 hours a day for some mega giga corporation that is 21. century version of slavery when places like this exist just hour or two from them...
Nothing like 2 dudes sharing some noodles
Hi from Ireland
I want to hang out with slightly drunk Ryotaro.
Gotta say, drunk Ryotaro is pretty adorable 🥺😀
Ive been trying to save up to come to Japan for 10 years now, but something always happens to me, money wise or worldly, the big C germ. You're videos keep me happy and always planning for the trip I'll one day get to.  Love your vids! <3
At this point I'm watching abroad in Japan just to get hyped and save money to go to japan , thanks for the cool content.
48 Celsius. What's that in American
You guys always just go straight to eating n never say the Japanese ritual word which is "itadakimos" or something.....why break the ritual?? Every weeb like me are all very upset🥺🥺
make a RYOTARO-MOVIE !!!!!
ryotaro is my favorite tbh.
so interesting to hear Ryotaro's accent
Ryotaro is honestly the most beloved person I’ve ever seen on the internet. Much love and respect to him!
LOL
👺
When you are taught a new language, you tend to talk with their accent, and use the slangs they teach you. This guy sounds british when he speaks english, leads me to believe hes been around you for far too long.
Take #AnimeMan to, #Tengu! 🐻🧐🍪
I absolutely adore your videos, thank you and to Ryotaro for sharing you points of views!  My heart is full seeing the friendship and acceptance! May you both be blessed.
That’s it! No more beef for you sir!
Bruh Ryotaro and I have the same drunk state
I ❤ Rysotoro!
Drunk Ryotaro is my soulmate. Loud/obnoxious/life of the party.
In Okinawa i had Habu Saki there was a dead black snake in the bottom, it was really good its a shame you cant get it here in the UK.
Nani! is Risotto's Hairline thinner?
Fuck that accent is killer. A _"I learned English from a Brit"_ with a twinge of some sharp Japanese consonants. So fucking cool!
Such a treat to be with you at this beautiful place! Thanks again Chris ✨
I'd love to take exactly this tour with guides like Chris or Ryotaro!
Ryotaro is such a funny dude 😂
The sordid menu approximately nest because scale technologically strap with a trashy turret. laughable, purring fall
from someone who stays home all the time studying, TAKE ME WITH YOU  I'm in Japan pretty please, sir 😭
I really want to drink that Spring water
Your japanese friend sounds like an amazing person to hang with
Only here because of Ryotaro
Risottoro was the best. More please
Ryotaro is pissed of his mind 🤣🤣
I like how Ryotaro is just friendly all the time and he keeps roasting him
Ryotaro would be fun in a drinking competition.
Come for Chris, stay for Ryotaro.
The moment Chris said that "I feel like we're in a cutscene" line I, 100% heard the line "oh, good, you're finally awake." Because of course Skyrim won't ever leave me alone.
I'll pay to see thoughs 2 get drunk in one video lol
I have to pair it! :D
Very funny fat man! I like the videos! Subscribed for lifuuuuu
Sake in the video - nice, luxury hotel - good. Drunk Rentaro sings a song - PERFECTION!=)
Expensive
Ryotaro is awesome 😂💪🏿
Chris and Ryotaro are like...these 2 characters in cartoons where one is really dark and moody and the other one is all colours and happiness 🤣 Like The grim adventures of Billy and Mandy, for example
I love drunk Ryotaro!
Man, been watching you for a couple years-ish now Chris, and I'm never disappointed. It's just well-made, entertaining television. I owe ya.
Love your channel and I love watching Ryotaro 👍🏻
Aguante Argentina papá!
You got my thumbs up, but only because of Ryotaros presence. Greetings from Ze Germania🙃🤪
Chris I have been a fan of your videos for a long time now. I think the charm of your videos of course is your British humor and an English bloke trying to find his way through Japan making friends with local Japanese.  You videos with Natsuki and Ryotaro are the best! You gotta loose the others like Anime man or Tokyo creative girl. They are a bummer. !
Did not know you were a fellow lefty!
If this is "Slightly dtrunk"..What will he be like when he's completely sh!t faced??
Risottoro is the man.
The best thing is how Ryotaro made Chrisreach 2m subs because of his 1.5m subscriptions 👍  Congrats Chris!🎉🎉🎉
Had no idea Chris was left-handed. Really surprised me
👺
Ryotaro and Natsuki must be the 2 loudest Japanese dudes in the whole of japan :P  Natsuki is my spirit animal. Ryotaro is the wise teacher
Drunk Ryotaro is bae 😂💞
Connor's whole ancestry is turning in the grave watching you guys drink sake
Every time I see pork, I hope to god it’s fully cooked through.
2:30 is this just for the prestige of having seemingly "good" water, or is there anything specific they're looking for? Couldn't they use distilled water if they want it to be pure?
you can be nice to ryotoro every now and then...only sometimes
14:25 being killed to be a chopstick stand lol
My gosh that tongatsu looked incredible. I wish English cuisine was as nicely presented and interesting as many Japanese dishes. I love the decor and aesthetic of the rustic Japanese inn too. Just looks wonderful.   Congratulations on the two million (plus) subs. Quite the achievement!
I like Ryotaro
Wait a second...a lot of maintenance is replacing a roof every 30 40 years?  A roofs life in Florida is like 15 years if a hurricane doesnt come through.  I wouldnt think straw would be fabulous and durable like that but that is amazing
Everytime I watch a vid by these two I just crave the drinks y'all get or the foods y'all buy up.
Ryotaro is very interesting man love Japan
I've been watching this channel for about 3 or 4 years and just now realized Chris is left handed.... YAY LEFTY!!
Omg no Ryotaro! Now that song's stuck in my head again.
20 minutes of two man getting drunk over the course of a day. Can there be something more entertaining than this?
After examining a few videos with Ryotaro, I can certainly say that he looks like a Japanese Tom Hanks.
I’m in love with ryotaro
Japanese food never fails to impress 😍
no you didn't
Ryotoro is the cutest love from germany ❤️❤️❤️
Ryotaro is the star of this channel. A gem in this rough coal mine of this channel.
10.45 that game you are refearing to is half life. And you are now arriving at the black mesa facility.  Please enjoy your day.
Your like my funny uncle
Abroad in Japan: Tactical Pork-eating Action
wanna try everything thanks bye
I think I may just start referring to Chris as "Chris Board". #RisottaroSays
damn i just finished watching a video of you and ryotoro in a hotspring in and this one now. ryotoro got old quick :O lots of grey hairs
Congratulations on 2M... love the videos
Hearing Ryotaro sing Don't Cry for Me Argentina made an amazing song that much better. Brings tears to my eyes.
ah Risottaro is amazing
the part where he pretends to get ran over by the cart😂
Ryotoro is pretty much the new face of this channel, you should change the name to "Ryotoro in Japan - with chris  broad"
Do the Japanese really like pork? It seems from these videos to feature heavily.
10:33 remembered the opening scene of Half-Life. lol.
Mmmmmm.... Pork Tactics...
I love love love your videos! Me and my friends are inspired to go to japan now haha
You’re a nice chap Chris! Good hearted and hard working. Thank you for the great videos you’ve done over the years. You manage to communicate what Japan is like well and through your videos it shows how much you’ve loved that country and it’s culture. Keep the good work and I hope to meet you one day.
Natsuki made me subscribe. (like... 5 years ago?)
No smoking, eating or drinking in the transit system!
Risotto was clearly getting drunk xD
Amazing place!
Nothin says Tengu like a massive wooden sign warning people about COVID 19.
"Pork tactics" has to go on the website soundboard.
I would try the different sake tours and the feast at the hotel
Great vid!!
Two things so far: First, I want to go to pork city. Second, as a fellow lefty, I've been placed either on my own side of the table, or the left corner my entire life, so it's nice to hear it acknowledged as a thing.
Ryotaro, so glad you are still working with Chris. lpl
Ryotaro has his own YouTube channel now and has almost 100k subscribers
Ryotaro is very funny guy*** 😁😁😁😁 i want to see him more in ur videos
Ik they fkd that night!! Lol jk!! All my respects! Great videos!!
one of the things Ryotaro said about the normally low doors and ceilings I almost knocked myself out more than ones on door frames btw I'm 6'3" so Japan was a challenge lol but I would return in a heartbeat if I could
👺
I want to go there so bad
It took me too long to realize Chris Board didn't make sense and I had nothing to drink lmao.
If you’re not a teacher anymore, how do you make money to live in Japan? This YouTube channel?
Thank for sharing
Following this channel for some quite time now and watching a lot of videos with ryotaro it's crazy how his english improved more and more over time
yeah that pork looks awesome, great video.
i suspect chris putting on a big whide jacket so we don't notice how round he's gotten :P (not like i can talk but...you know XD)  ps: Forgot something very important..*pokes chris' belly* there  pps (I should just finish watching the video before posting): That guy who did the sake tasting at otone errm.....erm...Mr. abe? Anyway he has the most wonderful calm voice. Imagine how calming like..i dunno..book-readong session would be XD  and thank you for making all those videos over the years
Ryotaro is just ridiculously attractive. Handsome. Suave. Intelligent. Witty. Perfection. Yum.
Chris would look 20 years younger if he didn't have piers morgan's haircut
that cart ride reminds me of the half life intro
I love the brewery owner's white jacket thing he's got on. Anyone know what that is called?
Ryotaro’s stolen British accent slips a bit when he’s drunk 😂
I want to see more of drunk Ryotaro in the future!
Congrats on 2 mill, Chris! Yall did and are doing an awesome job! Keep it up! P.S. That tonkatsu looked amazing... i am hungry now!
What I want to know is...where did Risottoro learn the word "Innit"
12:22 love the voice crack.
When will Ryotaro be inducted as one of the Japanese national treasures?
Legit just the lads vibing in the snow forest while enjoying beverages
You two guys are hilarious together.  I'm a tonkatsu fanatic.  Also curry rice.
Chris Board is so cute, but I don't wanna say the word 'cute' because it goes very much against his character.
Water people are envious
5:35 me when the new ATOT comes out
Chris begins to sound a lot like Jeremy Clarkson
Congrats on 2 million subscribers! You and your friends are so charismatic and funny you could make any country look incredible, and you have inspired me and so many people to want to visit Japan someday. Thanks for all the great videos!
lol Chris teasing Ryotaro while he was drunk gave me life
The voice of the hot sake gentleman is very deep but so gentle, is amazing!
Chris and Ryotaro sitting with dominant arms knocking during dinner once again, after they already wished they thought that through better earlier at lunch 😚👌
I really enjoy the places you two go to!!
Very Father Ted to get run over by the world's slowest golf cart 🤣🤣
I really like these movies. Wanting to go back to visit Japan again. With Ryotaro and natsuki in them it's always so much fun. Congrats on the 2M subs.
I need someone to take me to all the spooky places when I hit a mil
16:28 Chris BOARD 😂😂😂 Oh my lord
Drinking game: take a shot every time Chris mentions getting drunk in a forest (works best if you do it while also in a forest)
What savagery is this, drinking wheat beer (Weizen) directly from the bottle?
Congratulations 🥳 for 2 million subscribers
10:33 You're finally awake
This is the worst video ever about Japan. It felt like to drunks without imagination chit chatting about nothing. The hole enterprise was without any relevant research including information about what was included in the $250 cost. What about the food, sake tasting, spring trip etc. Was there any tipping involved to the staff? One has to be really mediocre and brainless to follow this guy. I've wasted my time listening to bar talk about nothing. Stay away from "Abroad in Japan." There are many quality videos about Japan on YouTube.
Drunk Ryotaro is hilariously adorable!!!
16:29 *Chris Board*
Would've liked to know more about the different Saki's but that's probably being edited for another video. You sneaky bastard.   Nah everything about this video was really good but was a bit confused on who Ryotaro was talking to the whole video at first. Never seen that bloke before.
Mister who is Abroad, I'd like to ask: How is it, that you and Ryotaro are able to exchange offensive jokes which in western culture are usually the norm among friends however japanese people may find them rude?
Drunk in Japan
The “Pork Tactics” were definitely the best thing....besides the in-room onsen. 😉
Was it just me, or was this entire video just 20 minutes of Chris bullying Ryotaro? 😂
6:57 I had no idea you are lefty! "Welcome" to the club. The most creative people (than right handed)...allegedly
rytaro sugar daddy :D
youre doing great!
Congrats
Happy Ending!
the food always looks so tasty :D and that water really was so clear XD
Nothing over a good Weizen!
Lol the way the sake guy fake drinks from his cup the water my dude doesn’t even believe in his own stuff.
When it comes to pouring someone's drink, Chris doesn't know the meaning of "stop." CDawgVA learned that the hard way in his recent video with Chris. The dude's a mad man.  Joking aside, congrats on 2 mil.
20 seconds in and I'm already holding my lungs in place xD this fffoocking guy!
I see no one talking about how absolutely silky smooth the voice of the brewer was at 8:39

Chris Board lol
I'll give the foodfeast a stiff upper lip.
Hesitation is defeat
Ryotaro is the real star of the show ! :) Chris is the filming man
Damn thats an epic inn.
Agree with the pork tactics. I do that too!
Even after pointing out they should change their seating because they keep bumping elbows the proceed to sit the exact same way the next meal 😂🤦
As a Londoner, I absolutely love Risottoro; he’s bloody hilarious. Innit.
Congratulations 🍾 🥂🍻 Well deserved 👏🏻👍🏻
14:30 so uh, why does it appear that you happen to be wearing the same shirt?
The sake part looks fun
Can we get a Ryotaro documentary?
Chris is left handed?
I'm absolutely here for Ryotaro <333
“That’s a Tengu”
Gotta love Ryotaro
Chris: *wakes up* Ryotaro: Hey, you. You’re finally awake.
Chris Bored 😂 Congrats on 2 mil !
Man you have no idea how happy i get when i see that you posted a video <3 <3_<3  they are just sooooo good the quality compared to other channels is so f**king high !!
👺
So is Ryotaro from Leeds or?
Now that you’ve hit 2M subs - do you think you could afford a sense of style? Love you tho
Excellent video Chris. Love your work, and belated congratulations on 2 million subscribers!
Maybe it's that I love listening to native speakers talk in their own language but I wish that the interviews were mainly in Japanese, especially since Chris knows Japanese! Yes, when speaking to us, switch it back to English, but other then that, keep it Japanese, I'll gladly read the subtitles. Besides you can see that they become more comfortable and open when they hear their own language, just like anyone else would.
i love how in america, $250 is about average for a hotel room, and you get a basic continental breakfast and that's it, meanwhile in japan 250 bucks gets you what you would normally have to pay at least 500-600 for, per night. it's insane.
That Tonkatsu looks godly, I felt legitimately jealous watching you eat it.
Dear Chris I really enjoy fine cigars do you think you could do a video on a Japanese cigar lounge one day I think it'd be pretty interesting.
yay, Congrats!!!
Fantastic as always Chris!
Ryotaro is the best
Your rly living the life. I could only dream of going to Japan one day. And my god Ryotaro is such a wholesome person. We would make great friends. Anyway thx for the amazing content your providin us with. keep it up
I would enjoy looking at a video of Chris thanking Ryotaro after all that roasting, I feel bad for him, he feels like a genuine friend :')
Congrats on your 2MM subscribers! I really enjoy your videos.
Ryotaro is hilarious with a sake buzz.
GOOD HEALTH AND WELL-BEING PRE PREMIER
GENDER EQUALITY PRE PREMIER TOP PING ONSEN STABLES
So why cant Ryotaro drink?
I love you Ryotaro! I really enjoy every video that you are in! You are very fun and have a lovely vibe. Keep it up and I hope to see a lot more of you with Chris this year! Congratulations Chris on hitting 2.1 million! Here's to 3 mil! I am glad to have stumbled on your channel, which I don't even really remember how, but nevertheless, I wish you the very best and hope you keep going strong! <3
I like Ryotaro, but honestly me and the other 1.5 Mil subscribers are here thanks to Natsuki
So i wanted to ask you. How did you learn japanese and how long did it take you? I absolutely love the japanese culture and i really want to visit it one day. But for that i want to learn japanese and therefore i thought i might aswell ask you :D Great video as always and I'm hoping for a response! Greetings from switzerland
OMO FINALLY FRO 2.09M to 2.1M!!!
Drunktaro carried the vid
You should collab with the sidemen post covid and take them on a journey across Japan
they going to have a hangover
Truly enjoy these videos, love seeing you guys together (as a Brit who lives elsewhere, I hope you guys genuinely have decoded your senses of humor and get along alright), the last 4 or so years where I've been watching have really whet my appetite for visiting Japan and jumpstarted my language learning and respect for other cultures. Good on ya, Chris. Don't stop - not yet at least.
Real talk, Ryotaro's videos are great. Go watch them.
Watching you drink water fresh from a stream without filtering it is surreal. You could never do that in the US, so much (most maybe?) of our waterways are polluted by something.
2 Million Subs... Yep it's Ryotaro!!
I visited Japan just before all the covid stuff got crazy and visited a hot spring inn. I didn't drink while there, but it was still a pretty nice experience.
its creepy innit
I'd like to see Chris and Ryotaro share a room for week. That would make for some excellent entertainment.
I live in Gunma.I want to eat Pork cutlet!!   Yutorian is very nice inn!! I want to go.
My favorite has to be the tonkatsu just for the fact that I don't eat pork anymore cause of health reasons. Makes me crave for a fatty, thick slice. Watching people eat such delicious food is torture but a nice torture.
Ryotaro singing Evita was too good and completely unexpected. 10/10
god your filming is brilliant
I might have to unsubscribe because watching your videos is horrible.  It makes me want to go to Japan while I can't due to the pandemic 😭
I just really want Chris, in just one video, to say "look I joke a lot, but Ryotaro is legitimately my friend and I really think he's a good guy. I only make fun of him like this on camera."
Drunk Ryotaro was the best. Actually I would love to watch him streaming and drinking :D
Lamb preparation?
Beef strategy?
I just realized risotto-san have skill to be some kind of presenters if you know what I mean
Remember, that you had less subscribers than Simply red? Thank you for learning me all kinds of things in japan! And I hope to see more of you in the future,
👘👘👘
I gotta admit without  a problem that, Ryotaro adds 60% more color and joy to chris videos, congrats for the 2M Christian Plank.
Not gonna lie I really enjoy Ryotaro. He seems very charming and it looks like it'd be a great time to talk with him.
Ryotaro seems like an awesome friend to have lol
The best thing about this vid was seeing you wearing matching pajamas with your best bud. Cute.
Please never change Ryotaro
I have a major crush on Ryotaro so totally here just for him 👀
Chris I really fancy you a looooooot okay 😘 xoxo from France 🇫🇷 are you single by the way ???? I need to know … hope never gives up
Watching your videos makes me incredibly happy. I desperately want to visit Japan but I think I'd need several months and an absolute fortune to really have a good explore.
Ryotaro for president. That man is a treassure.
Sure u arent just hiding ur alcoholism at this point
Hello a road in japan 😄
Omg I am howling watching this video 😂😂 It’s amazing how you weave in documentary style, landscape, history, culture, and entertaining banter all in one. 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 Congrats on 2 million!
I appreciated the pork tactics! Useful masticating information.
Congratulations on a huge achievement you have made a lot of people very happy and a few sad...f@*k those guys though!  I think you need to release some celebratory merch, the perfect, logo (in gold): pork tactics.
Does anybody have a google maps link of the tonkatsu restaurant? Cannot find it under tonkatsu tomita.
Can you ask Ryotaro or Natsuky about the bubble economy in Japan that lasted from 1984 until middle 1990s? Also what do you think about the situation of homeless people in Japan? I saw another youtuber called Nobita talking about the subject.
A Board in Japan
Watched all your videos, great job, charming, keep going, thanks a lot
Every bitcoin investor right now is just smiling at the price of bitcoin as it held strong and indeed valuable enough to generating good return of investment. More persons are gonna become millionaires and we have bitcoin thanks for that
this seems like a nice place to go to. shame it doesnt seem like I'll be able to go any time soon in the next couple years......
Did he head off for a three week vacation to celebrate the big milestone?
Me: *sobbing, in actual tears begging on my knees* Please what is  your name!!!?!?!     Abroad in Japan:  BRITISH GUY  LIVING IN JAPAN!!!!!!!!!
You’ve won at life if you have a friend like Ryotarou
Since you're British, do you feel nostalgy for good old neighbourhood pub with a good locally brewed beer??? 🍺 Actually, what is a beer like in Japan??? Is it any good??? Can it compare with European beer styles??? 🤔 Do they know how to brew??? 🤣
Congrats on the subs!
I'm here because I'm a Ryotaro fangirl
Hey Sensei, Can U make a video on how to become a Manga artist in japan? Even if you are japanese or Non Japanese person
Hey Chris, which are the best places in Tokyo for street and city scape photography? I am not shy with my big ass 200 mm lens, but I dont speak a single word of japanses, so I'd rather go somewhere where I dont have to deal with people complaining about me taking photos.
I am so intrigued by how you switch between languages so easily, or at least it looks very easy!
Within their country, the Japanese seem very concerned with not disturbing others.  Why then if they are at an European tourist destination with a guide they are a swarm nightmare pushing everyone else right our of their way to follow their guide? And, the guide, who by way also ignores all the other tourists are pushing out of the way to get close to whatever they are viewing.
Sitting at a beautiful river, getting drunk on sake. Best way to start the day, and probably end it too.
Man, great video, congratulations and drunk Ryotaro is great , i laughed a lot with this video By the way ryotaro have kids?
Risotoro seems WAY more fun when he's drunk =)
OMG, great vid and I am so jealous of that tonkatsu! (not to mention the sake and beer!)
Good job my new friend! Thanks for this. 👏🏻
i just finished my take home exam at 3 am and like a luch said i might as well take a few to celebrate.   was feelin bad until i saw ryotaro.  at least I dont have  a drinking problem like him
You forgot to mention 'Dave in Japan', is he still in your basement?
What a beautiful ryokan!
Fewer views, not less views. And you an English teacher.
Well thats alot for just 250 dollars....hell I might do this one day 😳✋❤❤
Great episode. You guys are maturing well. Kampai.
u-urokodaki san w-what are you doin there
U are both pretty well drunk )
Congratulations on your success. My favorite part was when the Sake master shared the beautiful gentle stream and saluted. His respect and grace seemed very strong. I would have loved to have learned more from him. The rest of the show seemed to enjoy learning a little less and being a bit more silly or maybe it was all the Sake because of the celebration 🍾. Congratulations to you and your guests on your successful YouTube channel.
LOVE your videos.
I'm really glad you showed the Tomkatsu, I'd like at some point to visit Japan and although I do want to try the local cuisine in most cases I'm building up a list of dishes I know I'd be able to palette for a regular (non adventurous) meals.
Asbestos floor mat reveal when?
Go search the island of tsushima
Daddi abroad where art thou
Bubbly Sake', interesting.  And, the pork looks delicious.
Ryotaro is the man.
You mentioned on the podcast that Ryotaro can't drink too much but he seems plastered in this video! Was he alright afterwards?
I love the fact that they brew a Weizen in Japan. Congratulations on 2m. Love from Germany.
You alive?
This was one of your best videos!  A perfect way to party for your 2 millions subs! Ryotaro is so funny and nice, I'd love to have a japanese friend like him. And besides... he's kinda right, the videos with him are the most luxurious ones!
👺
Can't wait for next months video.
Hope y'all are ok after quake
I want to get drunk in the forest.
#AskAbroad in what direction do you write in japanese
I think the best part was the Sake in the forest... but the whole video was fun to watch!!
Besides the great content, the cinematography is getting better and better. Some amazing shots in this one, Chris!
3 weeks is he still alive?
As I watch this  see 656,656 views!  How fucking cool!
RYOTARO was the best thing about this video. Cheers. 🙃
I think channel needs to be rebranded: aBOARD in Japan 😂
You both would be such a cute couple <3
What did you bring with you when you moved to Japan? What do you wish you would have brought with you?
Why is the rate of suicide cases so high in Japan?
この人は日本住みか🇯🇵
Lmfaoooo the way you guys were sitting in the restaurant gave me flashbacks to assigned seating I had in a middle school science class. I was a left handed dude sitting on the right of a two person desk. The other guy was right handed and sat to my left.
Your videos are so well produced 😍 Feels like they are getting better and better.
Is Mead a thing in Japan? I'd love to see Chris and Natsuki drink some and their reactions on it.
Absolutely dying to visit Japan hopefully this year, you've given me loads of ideas!
Hey Chris I am taking my daughter  to Japan gor her 18th birthday  next year is there anything that you would recommend we must do whilst we are there planning on going to kyoto osaka and then tokyo xx
*CONGRATULATIONS on getting over 2,090,000 SUBSCRIBERS and up to now 274,551,229 views. VERY WELL DONE MATE.  Rob (London)*
Can you purchase the sake form the tasting session in europe for example and if its possible what are the names of those bottles ? :)
Ryotaro is so funny
One of the best Ryotaro's performance
"slightly drunk"
Another morning in black mesa
tonkatsu so oiishi ;-)
dont understand why there  are even dislikes on your video. its such  a good content.
Odd anecdote, but my father was stationed in Niigata during the Korean War and he said Nikko region (don't know if that is the way to say that) was the most beautiful region in Japan. Have you been there and is it? I want to visit Japan and it seems to be an outdoorsy kind of trip versus a big city trip.
Deer, Bear, Boar x Pork Tactis  Set, Fight!
Your my inspiration to do exercise
I really want to move to Japan and work for around a year. I have no prior knowledge of Japanese. I live in the UK and am finishing my A levels, I don’t plan on getting a degree, is it still possible to get a job in Japan, what sort of things should I be looking out for???
What camera does he uses? It looks so crisp.
@15.17 Chris pouring CONTENT
Khrish San is a famous youtuba.
I hope no one urinates near the water source from where water is collected for sake !
Congrats on 2M! I want to try genuine tonkatsu when I visit, but currently I'm hoping I can find a UK importer for the beers you had.
Chris and Ryotaro a dynamic duo like anakin and obi wan
"As you can tell, Ryotaro is slightly drunk" * bang bang * Waaaaaa! Oraa! * bim bam boom boom * Woow... hohohoho!  Ahh yes, "slightly"
My gosh Chris, the shot at 5:09 is so crisp and clear (on my 4K monitor) it looks like some official commercial.
chris the time has come, upload something!!
These videos would be better if Chris wasn't in them :\
Pork tactics lmfao
Cheers my dude! Good work.
I love every Vide with Risottoro :) 2.1 mil and countinr
Congrats on 2Million Dave Board!!!
Found your channel the other day and just finished watching it all. Now I need more.
Some friends and I are planning a second trip to Japan and I'd love to try the sake in Northern Japan!
I really want to try the pork! It looks so delicious! 🌻
There is no better way to celebrate 2M subs than a pork sanger, sake and feast in a ryokan. Some of those Gunma onsen towns are quite awesome. 👺 Congrats on 2M! When you see something like this it is easy to see why. Great stuff.
Gutted that you did a video in Gunma without making a single Initial D reference.
...
What type of coat does the Sake dude wears?
Lol  chris is extra thicc in this video
G'Day Chris. So. What is your favourite Japanese English loanword? 😀😃
@abroadinjapan it's actually the Kashozan Ryugein Mirokugokokuzen Temple
We need a PORK TACTICS T-Shirt 😂
Im hungry...
Nothing to do with the video, but I have a question.  I have noticed that a lot of the younger, western generation use texting abbreviations during in-person conversations. Is it the same in Japan?
The mountain water and the tonkatsu looked amazing
More pork tactics around Japan please let's go!
Crying with laughter slightly drunk ryotaro is everything 😂😂 DONT CRY FOR ME ARGENTINAAAA
Who hasn't gotten drunk in a forest?
Hello helloooo abroad in Japan I am really glad you are doing well really enjoying your videos a lot excellent videos as always hope you are doing well can't wait for new videos go get em tiger.😸😸😸
I sick of japanese food. I rather eat pizza burger and fried chicken
Wow you are lucky nice food and no lockdown in the England no resturants open yet just bad takeaways
Drunk Ryotaro is the best Ryotaro : D
There should be an off-branch of this channel called "Drunk in Japan"... Although, scratch that - I wish it was the theme of the main channel haha
damn it chris, I've watched every video and these videos are the only ones helping me cope with depression. when's the next one?!
Ryotaro has got that Madonna song stuck in my head now....
Congrats Chris and Riotaro!
looks like a interesting place
a ryotaro and natsuki video would be absolute chaos and i would love to see it
you read your comments Ryotaro is annoying as fuck
Chris looks like he both loves and hates what’s he does at the same time
2 middle age men drinking and having fun with each other THIS IS CONTENT
10:33 Chris has played Half-Life all right
lmao at that moment Chris says "kanpai" to the sake brewer you can tell he's halfway into another world with all the sake
Congratulations on 2M, and ryotaro is right 1:34 .
5:36 The only part of this this video that I could related to.
Subacribed just today and i've been watching the whole day. Very entertaining content! Bery vety good and quite educational. Especially love all the food!
@abroadinjapan when can we expect a new video ?
Drunk ryotaro is best Ryotaro
#AskAbroad If going to japan, are there any restaurants that don't use chopsticks? I am not experienced on those.
I could watch these two drink and take the piss out of each other all day 😂😂😂
I also sing that song from Evita when I'm at a balcony
I just started watching Chris Channel about 2 years ago now but the videos and spicial guest are so enjoyable to watch and not only that I learn so much about Japan from these videos that I can't stop watching. So funny to and real comments about everyday life fails and successes while living in Japan. Thanks Chris and Congrats on 2M Subscriber's. Keep making Videos Please!! We 💕 them!
I'm glad I watched this video so I could learn some pork tactics
3 mil would like to see ryotaro natsuki and Chris roasting while drinking sake..
ARGENTINAAAAA
日本に来る外国人は親切です。 いつもありがとうございます。
Nakai has wan.......dered.......
Shocking turn of events, the golf cart was hoping to run Ryotaro too.
I JUST REALISED THAT THE ‘ABROAD IN JAPAN’ USERNAME IS A PLAY ON CHRIS’S ACTUALLY NAME. HIS NAME IS CHRIS BROAD. A BROAD IN JAPAN.  ITS BEEN LIKE 7 YEARS AND IVE ONLY JUST NOTICED THIS NOW. HOLY SHIT.
It's like 'Wish you were here' and 'Food and Drink' had a japanese love child...
God why is everywhere hapan has some amazing virws and places like wherever you go you can find something.
I might have missed it, but does the room cost 250 usd or the entire day? Because honestly that seems somewhat cheap.
Ryotaro had the energy of a 9 year old after drinking lol
Pork Tactitcs
Did Ryotaro just admit to bribing and/or intimidating 1.5 million people to sub?
Well, it’s a tough life but I suppose someone has to do it...........🙂
Great watching you guys!!! Greetings from Germany :-)
CONGRATS CHRIS!!! You really deserve this since most vids i enjoy look like they cost lots! I hope to see more wonderful content you make! 🙌🏻🥳
I am Japanese. He was fun.
Congratulations Chris!
Did I miss a video?! You're not teaching anymore?!
So,is he the real Japanese Jesus? Turning water into (rice)wine
10:33 skyrim
I started in 2018, you've come along way BOARD
One day we will look back on how we treated animals as one of the worst atrocities of mankind.
what? you hasn't foreign accent when you talk in japanese? impossible (笑)
This is one of my favorite channels on youtube even if I don't have time to watch when they come out, I always end up watching all the videos when I have time
Tactics. Risottoro, stop talking. Just broke up at that one. Get on.
I was watching Noriyaro and Sammit for the japanese drifting/car scene and somehow i ended up here 🤷‍♂️
The Springfield that they voted was the most like the one in The Simpsons was the Springfield in Illinois.
goood
16:28 Aboard in Japan... Surprisingly, it still works somehow...? 😂
Can you go to Takashima City and try funazushi?
nah nah we’re here for riyotoro 😂
Great vid! high quality. If he snores really bad, I'd recommend some earplugs!
i like the way your friends speak english
🤥👉👺
When Chris finds a wife, her channel can be "A Broad in Japan"
I love these videos and appreciate the great work you do. Thanks for the 20 minutes of escape to somplace cool you provide.
& may you have 8 1/2 more years of pork tactics, oh and videos
General click-baite title. Go in. Get documentaried. @.@
We need Ryotaro: The Movie
Congrats on 2 mill! But I do have to point out I’m only here for Ryotaro lol
I plan to head over to japan next year (if covid is..passing)   Is there a chance you do tours or alike? Or just like to show a dutch bloke around in japan ?
Chris and Ryotaro are perfect friends
What’s up Broski 🦋®️
10:34  "Hey, you're finally awake.."
Oh Ryo, for all the complaints about how annoying Chris’ elbow is. You should stop sitting to his left and start sitting on his right side.
https://youtu.be/l3xy8LWv67s
Breaking news! I didn’t know Ryotaro was a martial arts expert. Found him on a channel called Scenic Fights
I whant ryotoro as my guide when i comes over. And ill showe you norway when he comes her
Ryotaro now trying to kill Chris with alcohol poisoning.
Gratz on the 2 mil subs! Hope for many more to come, this content is something you cannot miss!
Ya know;  After all these years it never really dawned on me that Chris is left handed.  Lefties represent!~
finally.. woman can sit on man face properly
I need to stop watching Abroad in Japan at 3 am, all the food looks so good it makes me hungry
3:39 “CB” is a middle-aged man presenting to the emergency room with  tapeworms
I have been watching Chris for so long (across multiple accounts) and only now I realised I have not subscribed 😰  PS: Congrats on 2M 🤩
This guy right here has run out of ideas
like video.
お帰りください
I need Pork Tactics on a shirt lmao
BRUH
I can't get over how English Ryotoro sounds lmao... He sounds like he was half raised in Salford, Greater Manchester
Congo, Ryotaro for the 1.5 Miili👏👏 I guess, Chris contributed too 😁
i love ryotarooo
Did Riotoro attend to some English lessons recently? His English in this episode is amazing!
What is 48 degrees in freedom units?
Nice vid, just dudes being bros.
Amazing Inn.
God-tier tonkatsu
Drunk Ryotaro is like a DLC character of this channel
Where is Natzuki???????????????¿?????????????????????????????¿??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????...????????????
Well Chris... you might find this as a surprise.  But you ended up becoming part of the content of the Marketing class that I teach.  We have a massive portion dedicated to social media, naturally, it is great to share content from current creators who have proven themselves. I am just one of the Marketing teachers at school in Germany where classes are taught in English (ironic... no).  The school started out as a school for refugees and is now open to all people living in Germany (primarily expats).  It could be interesting to have you as a guest speaker... I have already featured Rani Mani from Adobe, Col Gray (Pixels Inc), Tara Hunt (Truly Social) and Richard Irving (from Hollister).  I sent you a LinkedIn request.... let's chat. - Kenneth Shinabery
Drunk in a forest? That your inner Brit coming out! What’s next getting pissed on a park bench?
such a great content. Thx maan. Hello from USSR
How come Ryotaro can't/doesn't drink?
Pork tactics, and Porking tactics.. Quite the difference.
17:41 The right bottle even has the German word "Weizen" on it which means "wheat" in English! :D
I want to know more about Ryotaro's career!!! It looks like he has a lot to talk about!
Ryatro is picking up a british accent, he didn’t sound that way like a year ago
So hard to find nice content like this. I don't know who, but someone actually needs to hear this, you've got to stop saving all your money. Venture into investing some, if you really want financial stability
Gonna subscribe because of Ryotaro lol just saying
Chris is left handed that's it that's the left straw...
Drunken Ryotaro is definitely the highlight of this video. More drunken Ryotaro, please!
i love their dynamic lmao
sukiyakiiiiiii
In this video, you visit a _rustic_ inn. Next, you need to visit a _rusty_ inn!
So… that wasn't a chopstick rest that _looks like_ a sardine. It actually *IS* a sardine. … Frankly, I wouldn't like that.
I can see it now. A Board in Japan - Pork Tactics Edition featuring a sponsorship by Dr. Jelly, theme song by Natsuki, and a rendition of Don’t Cry for Me Argentina by Ryotaro. XD
0:33 Initial D?
Imma say it, "Pork Tactics" sounds like something illegal...
No way that water's cleaner than purified water. Excessive, unnecessary step to make a luxury beverage.
I ship em
https://youtu.be/p75V2xI4jjU   These canadians stole your opening! World war III? 👀
I’d like arin Hanson to be on after the Backstreet Boys reunion tour settles down.
👺
Ryotaro singing "don't cry for me Argentina"... a dream. Greetings from Buenos Aires, Argentina.
I’ve been here since 500k or even before can’t remember brother I’m so happy seeing your channel finally getting the attention it deserve man.
#ASKABROD Out of all packaged snacks in Japan what is your favorite fancy snack.
Ryotaro is pretty fun not ganna lie. I wonder what type of crazy fun adventures they've done off camera
Started from my own room now I'm here.
Drinking vlog. All dayer
Even if Ryotaro says German sausages are better than British ones (are we comparing Irish v. Scottish v. English here?), no country beats British breakfasts.  Germany's muesli, charcuterie, cheeses and breads are lovely for lunch.  Britain's sausages, potato, tomato, toast, and bacon with coffee and orange juice (and in some towns, oatcakes) simply is marvelous and memorable.  Then again, American bacon with all its crispiness is the best bacon.
I was today years old when I finally realized Abroad in Japan is in reality a mukbang cleverly disguised as a traveling and culture show.
"Don't cry for me Argentina!", lol my dude is Evita. Congrats on the 2 million .
"BUT ANYWAY LOOK AT THE VIEW" the way he says it omg im dying.

Your videos reminds me of those British Documentary... wait a minute...
ryotaro is the owner of walmartANDKYU
In a way Abroad in Japan HAS become the Japanese TV shows for international community. Minus the "ehhhhh" "sukoi!" part
Anyone ever watch this with CC on? It keeps saying "sucky"
Do not type in p**k tactics into google. You will permanently dim the light behind your eyes and start selling insurance door to door.
I hope that river didn't have any deer pee in it, that's a great way to get the river runs.
Dear Chris. Is Japanese grammar written a bit like how Yoda speaks?  If yes, have I just split open how to learn Japanese, like Anakin did to all those younglings in Episode 3..?
Do you still meet up with your friends from the older vids like yuki? It would be great to see them in vids again now and then.
I don't know about pork tactics, but that tonkatsu looked Pork-tastic!
Alcohol the greatest thing to turn introverts into extroverts.
Drunk Risottoro  has massive  hyper-tired child energy
Why was slightly drunk Ryotoro absolutely hilarious... Just me?
Our delightfully 'underwhelming Japanese Villain' Ryotoro's latest attempt at murdering Chris through possible fish pee water and self driving cars patronisingly slower than the growth of my fingernails. (this was a pretty awesome video though Chris well done - what kind of camera do you use :))
Emperor Ryotaro walking out onto the balcony to gaze over his land as he serenades his people with a beautiful rendition of Don’t Cry For Me Argentina, was something I never knew I needed to see but will stay with me forever.
As you can see, Ryotaro is slightly drunk.  RAAAAAWW LOOKAT THAT!
Ryotaro is an adorable drunk
I am sorry Mr. Board, but Ryotaro is definitely the man here. To be fair he should replace you and change the channel name "Home in Japan". Love vids with Ryotaro!
Loved the content. Thank you all! Also, you're not fat.
Why do I feel like half of this video was dedicated to a certain Cannur?...
Love it!
Chris and Ryotaro are canonically a married couple in my mind. They even have matching outfits. How cute!
man this did not get in my feed till just now
@Abroad In Japan - I think it's very respectful that Ryotaro drank with you to celebrate the 2million subs, a sure sign of friendship when realistically he could have died - and what did you do? You shoved him in a closet. Nice Chris, Nice! Great video, one of the funniest to date. Nicely done :)
For a split second I thought it was Obama in the thumbnail
All right this was disgustingly cute and you two even matched!! (shirts and alcohol levels, only Chris hid it better) Congrats on 2M, dear Chris~ My favourite sarcastic a**hole ever <3
Have tokidoki emma on!
Tipsy Risottaro is joyous
Drunk Ryotaro is the best Ryotaro
I have a question, how much salary does a person needs to live by himself in Japan?I think having a 50k yen salary per month is  quite low depending on what that person needs and have to pay like rent,food,electricity and any other stuffs
Ryotevita is a silly drunk. =^[.]^=
Tonkatsu, without a doubt!
I’m so jealous of all the food you get to eat, I hope you enjoy it even more for those of us who can’t :)
CONGRATULATIONS!    I have followed the “pork tactics” without realizing it and I definitely want to try the champagne.
10:34 *insert unexpected skyrim here*
Congrats on 2m subs. I really like the production value ad cinematic shots. It feels like I'm watching a live show. 2M well deserved.
Tengu 👺 I had no idea 🤷🏼‍♂️
Drunk Ryotaro is hilarious.
I’ve been watching these videos for years, and only now realizing that Chris is left handed.
Congratulations to you and the Abroad community, you guys consistently put out quality content which makes me Japan-sick every time but eager for more. Great video Ryotaro!
本当の事言っていい? 君が日本に来た初期の頃・・・君は日本を気に行ってないように感じていました すぐ帰るのかなあ・・・と思っていました。　ごめんね。
二人がお友達になってから長いよね そういうの・・・とても好きです。
I've always wondered why you use dollars as an equivalent to yen instead of pounds
The best thing in the video was....... all of it! Yes, even the chopstick holder! Seems wasteful if you don't eat it though. Especially liking the private onsen. I'd be too self conscious to use a public one.
That tonkatsu looks so good 😣
Board in Japan  Also, can we get a running list of Ryotaro's dictionary? -pork tactics -cost performance
I’m living vicariously through you
loved the video !
Project Triangle Strategy: Pork Tactics
That tonkatsu looks so good.
Yo isn't drinking from a freshwater river dangerous?
استغفراللہ pork haram maaan
13:48 😂😂😂😂
@"It requires a lot of maintenance. You have to replace it every 30 to 40 years."  Uh... Once every 3 to 4 decades is high maintenance?
I used to love these videos and they get me hungry everytime, but now I cannot eat most meats anymore, so now they make me both hungry and very, very sad! : (
Beautiful Ryokan and amazing looking sake.  Sadly the closest I can get to Japan right now is eating frozen dumplings from Costco and watching your videos.  Thanks for dreamy content and humor, from Canada
When are U going to have Tokidoki traveller as a guest on the podcast?
👺
The hardest thing with Abroad in Japan is keeping up with Ryotaro when he's in a video XD
dang Ryo lookin sharp in that coat.
dear Chris do you have any tips on learning japaneese??
You guys are like real life Pokemon
Hey Chris! There is an American village in Okinawa...would be lovely to see you cover it🤗
Would love to see a video where you feature some local Japanese snacks, candies, etc. so we could get a taste of Japan through their exports at least. hihi
do a new video touring your new apartment/dwelling! it'd be great to see your upgraded apartment since the 2012's video! :D
very entertaining and informative video again ty :D greetings from Germany
Congratulations on 2m subscribers Chris. Is Ryotaro always looking to get plastered on the videos he tags along on? 😂
The chemistry between you guys tho 😂  love and hate relationship
"Pork-tactics" nice one 😂👏🏾
2 million subscribers special, when?
We're still waiting for the legendary Ryotaro Natsuki double appearance.
Interesting... Drunk Ryotaro = Sober Natsuki. Very interesting...
Mate, you could visit any area of Japan and I'd be entertained. Keep up the good work Mr Broad and Gang. Much love from Yorkshire :P also congrats on 2 Million subs.
im annoyed that this video was not in my subscriptions, I had to look for it in order to watch it.
Chris just a tip, make sure you maintain eye contact when you cheers <3
Looking good guys! I really want to visit this place.
The best of this vid is Ryotiro
A glass of surreal spring water and pork tactics, please. Will be the best meal ever I guess :D
Congrats on the 2 mil, Chris! Your channel brings me a lot of happiness - hope to be able to buy you, Ryotaro, and Natsuki beers someday.
All hail drunken Ryotoro, Lord Nempura! <3
Japanese guy is very charismatic,  outgoing, atypical for  japanese people. you make a great team, keep the good content going
Ryotaro is blitzed XD
Can I Japan please?
Aaah, Ryotaro trink also lieber Bier?
That hotel 🥰
" oh no put it back on ".... ..." special charity project ".... Laughed so hard!  Ahahaha
The knowing algeria notablely race because supply therapeutically pick anenst a victorious open. dangerous, disturbed pastry
Ryotaro pissed is the best thing about this video.
This is kind of off topic but does anyone know what brand of boots the brewer is wearing at 5:08?
The best part of this video: Drunk Ryotaro!!!! I, honestly, subscribe to your channel because of Ryotaro.
so bad there are no vegan options ever
I want to ask you why many foreigners have interested in Japan. 外国人の方がこれほど日本に興味を持ってくれてるのはどうしてなのか普通に気になります。
こんにちは〜日本人です。日本について様々なトピックで紹介してくれて、本当にありがとうございます😊英語は話せるので、もし日本や日本人について、何か質問があったら返信しますよー^_^   If you have any questions about Japan or Japanese,I can reply to you ^_^
i suddenly miss the journey across japan music. season 3 when?  and gz on 2m subs. effort and persistence more than often pay off. :)
I live in Gunma and it’s also my favorite prefecture. The mountains are magical here!
Is it just me, or does Ryotaro become progressively more and more British the drunker he gets?
demon slayer vibes xd
I would like to buy some chris board from chris broad
brookside.
Drunk Ryotaro and drunk Natsuki will be a great content.
I really like the idea of the private hot spring in your room, this could even be a good thing to point out to people who have never  been to an onsen before, but want to try it out alone. The food looked amazing too and imma have to remember them pork tactics Lmao
I see Ryotaro in the thumbnail, I click
It’s a nice hot spring and everything, but how many telephones does it have?
Been watching you so much that I had a dream that I met you in person and we hung out along with rissotoro, had such a good time!
Drunk Ryotaro woke up today and chose violence.
i like drunk ryotaro, he sounds like a good guy out on the terps.
12:07 that's an inn? How cute 17:19.
It might hit weird but I appreciate your work. I don't know what it feels like to have millions of followers but you have touched me as I have watched you through the years and alot of the people you are associated with. That might sound scary but, in fact, it's all love. Thank you for everything you do when it comes to your youtube channel..   https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Eq6EYcpWB_c
Commenting for algorithm
Ryotaro is a co host for sure lol. How hilarious and funny this video is
Here's to many more Pork Tactics!
My husband's is cracking me up. He watched the video with me and his only comment was are they wearing the same  shirt. Why are they wearing the same shirt. Do they always do that? Lol
Always enjoy watching the chemistry between you two lol makes my day each time 😂
I always get so hungry watching your travel vids like this one. Makes me super jealous too. I so want to take another trip back to Japan again and sample some of the places I have seen in your videos. XD
So much alcohol was consumed in this video that I'M feeling drunk.
That room is amazing!!! I love the onsen!
Brilliant! Thank you for bringing Japan to all of us!
Honestly, this is my favorite video so far Chris. Thank you so much for sharing your adventures with Ryotoro with us. You inspire me in so many ways.
"For the tall American people" *laughs in Dutch*
Ryotaro is so funny hahaha
It is really nice that Ryotaro talks about the German Feierabendbier
Congrats Chris! I've been following you since the early days. Ryotaro is a damn national treasure
Is Ryotaro still single? Asking for a friend 😆
Congratulations Chris! Amazing goal!
Thank you for filling the void that Soko ga Shiritai left.
Abroad in Japan is the only reason I'm still on YouTube that and getting to know more about Japanese culture thx Chris
Best
I'm honestly amazed by how much your channel has grown and even more surprised by how many interesting and unique people you get to meet.  I always wonder how you manage to set up these interviews though.
Gotta say, gorilla warfare ain't got shit on pork tactics.
Forest Sake experience top on video
Why are all the bathtubs filled with water?
Noice vod
I think ryotaro secretly planned your death by getting you drunk in the forest.
This was just a date vlog LOL
pork tactics
Congrats to 2m, Chris Board! Btw slightly drunk Ryotaro speaks as loud as one of those tall Americans 👺
We need more drunk Ryotaro.
Congratz of the 2mil subs=) your content is great! We love the videos that take a lot of hard work, but also the little ones where you sit in your room and talk are great. We just like your persona and the way you talk about things.
Ryotaro's balcony singing >-<3-> And would love some vegetable schemes for next video
I Love You Chris I Love You Ryotaro That's An Amazing Video
Ryotaro should be drunk in every episode - he is hilarious to watch.
Is it just me or Chris and Ryotaro casually just let us in on their honeymoon tour video disguised as a celebration of 2 million subscribers?!  Congratulations on the achievement though!! Your hard work towards this channel is really paying off!! 2M down, ways more to go!! I already love Japan and your videos are making me fall for it all the more. Happy honeymoon guys!! 👬👨‍❤️‍👨
'Why did you bring me here?' 'Well, it's creepy innit.'
Chris and Ryotaro Manzai when
I Love your videos. Thank you for showing Japan. I wish to travel there someday.
Amazing yummy 🤤🤤🤤🤤
I saw u being awoken by missile so i subscribed 😄
The view is stunning and the food is so delicious. Can't wait to go.😍
CONGRATULATIONS!
I have had that brand of beer before. It’s a good brand.
Way to go , Chris!  After all this time, I will follow you....Always. 😉. And I will never un hear “pork tactics”. Lol
I feel drunk just from watching...
Drunk Ryotaro is now my sleep paralysis demon
Man I miss Japan so very much. Cannot wait to come back to this wonderful country and spend even more time exploring it. Chris your channel and podcast has given me the chance to experience Japan from my home. I appreciate all your content and good luck going forward. I'll continue to support you :D
Great video but gosh, no idea where I'd start planning for this when travel permits. Also, question. Would it be in bad taste to want to tip the staff taking care of you at the inn when checking out?
I'd do everything but eat that sardine :D
Congrats on 2 million! You are one of my favorite people to see on my feed.
Ryotaro has really helped Chris' channel, so nice seeing a big figure supporting a smaller channel.
No Abroad with a pan, its Abroad with a man! 😝 (jk) love these videos with Risottoro!
I wonder if you can get pork tic-tacs in Japan.
Tipsy Ryotaro has to become more frequent, hilarious 🤣
The view
thanks for keeping it fun & original.
Take a shot every time Chris says "getting drunk in a forest."
14:30 was ryottoro expecting a sardine frott? where they going to spar with sardines?
Your friendship with Ryotaro is just so hilarious! Both of you are amazing and I love the episodes where Ryotaro is in, you teasing each other so much I can't stop laughing! :D
5:12 try the... pure... spring water, and get parasites from drinking raw water. >_(\
You're so practical and goofy at the same time!!😉🪵
Pork Tactics:)
Hey Chris, i was wondering if you could do a reaction video on ramen restaurant like ichiran or some other ones, thatnk you. I really enjoy your videos :)
This Natsuki guy is pretty cool
👺
congrats! and thanks for showing us these beautiful places
Risottoro's energy level made me want to take a nap.
I've watched this video so many times now because I can't stop thinking about Pork Tactics.
I would like to hear Ryotaro speak Spanish (I know he has a degree in Spanish)
-_- I pay almost double that just to stay at a crappy hotel in Atlanta for work. It gets reimbursed but still.
Pork tactics!  🤣🤣🤣🤣
me, german: so it is like schnitzel the japanese: so you have chosen death
Turned this on wondering how Ryotoro was going to kill Chris. Instead he even had a sober self driving car take them to their room after sake. Chris should just keep him a little drunk for his own safety.
Congrats on your 2M subs 🎉 unlike others Im here because of the sake 👺
Just telling my friend about this channel iv watched for years and I have now just realised the link between the channel name and Chris's surname. Lockdown has ruined me 😪🤣
After many feedback surveys with the answer Tonkatsu.... I can now retire happy
Always love watching your videos. Thanks for creating them. 😁 xx
What's good in life, Conan? -Beer in your belly, sake in your cup and the lamentation of pork tactics!
Ryotaro was born in wrong universe he should have been Disney prince
Drunk Ryotaro is absolutely hilarious and entirely more tolerable LOL Also, Left Handed people are superior.
you call saving the best piece last instinct, i call it survival.
The dolls that are in cases behind the Sake drinking Chris back are seriously creepy🎎
Silly Ryotaro, everyone knows that 1.5mil of the subscribers are actually here for Natsuki!
How do your videos either stay thr same or get better. There's never been a decrease, there's been some amazing highlights in formats that I miss. Like Tohoku 365, journey across Japan. Now that I think about it. Its never been not amazing. Every video Chris has made has been awesome.  Also Chris if your reading this, we need a post Covid Pete Donaldson adventure. A big one.
Ryotaros gone wild🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ He's like a toddler whose had too much sugar...
Take a sip of hot sake, and Japanese forbidden knowledge will bash you hard
Hobbits? More like Oompa-loompas, since you're talking down to "the help".
i realize Ryotaro english is getting so much better
Heya Chris, I just wanted to let you know I was watching YouTube videos late at night, about to fall asleep, when this autoplayed. My eyes weren't completely in focus (as can happen when you're tired) and when I saw the abundance of red on screen combined with the music my brain filled in the rest and imagined I was looking at a horrific scene of bloody guts and suddenly I became much more awake and incredibly disturbed. A second later my eyes could make sense of what I was looking at and I became very annoyed that it was some flipping Tengu decorations that caused me such distress. So yeah, thought you would appreciate knowing that happened.
Super happy for you reaching such a milestone, been loving your videos for years now! But, although i might have missed it, how did you meet Risottoro?
Best part hands down was Ryataro "slightly" drunk.
Looks like wano kuni . And these two gentlemen bounce off eachother like luffy and zoro .
Is it hard for a vegan to life in Japan?
Doctor Broad on his way to the anomalous materials lab
Loved this video as alwayz!!!
“As you can see, Ryotaro is slightly drunk”  yeaah sure sligthly....
Id like to go to the stream. :3)
Y’all have way too much fun.
I'm in a weird situation where I am both older and younger than you depending on which video I watch, I feel like I'm learning and a creep at the same time.
Feel like there aren't a lot of good videos showing off Gunma, it's been on my list to visit for a while. Thanks Chris and more please!
I want all of it...
Clear highlight of this episode was half shitfaced Ryotaro
I'm so happy to see this man climb his way through... Pure talent
Congrats on reaching 2 million! Please continue to create great video's showing us Japan from a different perspective.
Such good fun when it's both you and Ryotaro in the video lol. <3
I need a new shirt with "PORK TACTICS".
im loving slightly drunk Ryotaro
This video made me jealous. Been in Japan since the begining of December, and I still haven't managed to have sake.
Who else randomly breaks into “Don’t Cry for me Argentina”? I thought I was alone 😅
Ryotaro is so hot
That huge place only has one bedroom?
A "Pork Tactics" T-shirt has to become Abroad in Japan merch!  :)
I love how Japanese people are so quiet and polite... then once you get to know them you get Ryotoro
That sake forest stream looks so beautiful. Maybe one day I can travel there.
Was that a half life reference?
Just wanted to say that your videos are a joy to watch and a great way to relax when life it tough in the pandemic. Feels like we get to explore Japan too! Thank you for your hard work making all these!
I hope you do a Journey Across Japan with Ryotaro, I want to see how you look after a week with him
"slightly drunk". Almost falls in closet
I’m going to Tokyo this summer for 3 weeks on a study abroad program. Are many places shut down because of Covid or is it what I’ve heard which is that it’s not really an issue there..... or at least compared to the US
I wanna drink a beer with Chris board!
10:34 - 10:40  Chris plays Skyrim confirmed
"it's like a video game cutscene" hey you, you're finally awake...
Congrats to 2M viewers and thanks to you for your efforts.  Easily one of the best travel video channels on all of YouTube.  One of these days I'll be vacationing in Japan and there will only be one place I'll go to plan and prepare - "Abroad in Japan."
Of course people are here for Ryotoro. He's a very handsome and charming man.
Man time flies: sitting here realizing I've been watching a sarcastic brit living in Japan for several years and from like few hundred thousand subs to 2 million. Something surreal about that realization.
wtf that PORK TACTICS caught me off guard hahahahaha
Hi Chris and Ryotaro, Congratulations on 2M subscribers. I came for Japan and stayed for the cynicism, humour and "Pork Tactics". This is a serious feast for the eyes. Cheers Muffy from Oz.
I want that water.
amazing as always
Definitely the pork tactics.
CONGRATS ON 2M (I'm just here because of Ryotaro)
Congrats!
Dave Board in Japan lol
Congratulations on the 2 million!!! Love the wit and the shenanigans 🥰
Thanks Chris. Now I'm hungry...  Wonderful video.
You and Ryotaro need a full Amazon series. Be epic.
We love you both! Great to see you Ryotaro!
Emperor Ryotaro! Loved this video! He should sing the whole song. Thanks Chris, I watched quite a few videos of yours before having my trip to Japan in 2019. Thanks!
Congratulations on the 2m, well deserved. I just wanna say that many of your videos don't deserve the moniker “content“. They far exceed the quality of what we're used to on YouTube, reaching a quality that you usually encounter in much bigger productions, all while keeping it light, funny, and entertaining as you do on social media. Carry on! (Also, can't believe it's already been two years that we met you in Tokyo. Hint: I got the “best girlfriend ever“ according to you, for getting me a “For Fuck's  Sake“ Shirt)
He’s off his tits 😂😂 Top comedy
Water is clear but how do you know there isn't a rotting dead rat in the water further upstream? Just cuz the water is clear, doesn't make it clean.
Ryotaro drunk could be a own channel, pretty good.
The best part for me was Ryotaro 'slightly' drunk 🤣. Can't have enough Risottero in your videos 😉.
2million. Wow... I remember when you had maybe 30k. I just started college and you showed me that my dream of moving to japan was really possible. 👍
Was this filmed more than a year ago? Someone pls put me at ease about the non existing covid protection
Congratulations Chris! And amazing ryokan! I hope I can plan a trip there sometime. Looking forward to another 8.5 years (and more) of Abroad in Japan 😁👍🎉
In the land of weirdness, I wonder if they have pork tic tacs ?
Hi, just passing by, reminding you that you're awesome and I enjoy your videos a lot.
Congratulations for 2 million subscribers Chris Board !
Ryotaro drunk, pork tactics, self driving golf cart, Chris "board" drinking sake in the forest, this video is just lacking Natsuki to make it perfect
Tonkotsu, sake tasting and a nice Japanese Inn. All the things I want to do right now! ❤
here since 200k~
the nagai guy kinda looks like elon musk or is it just me?
ポークタクティクス！！！ If Jiraiya from "Naruto" wrote about food instead of girls & love :P
A board in Japan
Here since 900k subs keep up the good vids🤘🏽
The Tonkatsu looked amazing! Its been about a year and then some since I have been able to eat my favorite Japanese dish which is katsu curry (due to covid shutting down dinning) and let me tell you did I drool when you two were enjoying it! Wonderful video as always and congrats on 2 mil.
It's skyrim, the video game is skyrim
Ryotaro drunk is amazing.
Whenever Ryotaro is in a video its such a treat xD love the dude
How rude from Ryotaro to let you drink "Wizen" from a bottle. As a man who lived in germany he surely knows how to drink it properly. 0.5 liter in a big glass called Weizenstutzen!  shame on you Ryotaro 😉
I love Chris, Ryotaro, sake and tonkatsu, so this video was great! Congrats on 2 million subs😊 The numbers speaks for themselves, always great content for a norwegian that would love to travel to Japan one day! Happy 2 mill subs🎉🎉🎉🎆🎈
"Pork Tactics" is the name of my 3rd person real-time strategy game involving pigs blowing each other up. So, basically I'm making "Hogs of War" again
I love food i love saké i love Japan, cheers 🍻
Ryotaro picking up some British accent there.
I can't wait to go yachting in Japan
Oh the envy. What a magical location. If only ryyotaro wasnt there
I've not thought about it before, but you clearly have a British accent when you speak English.  Do you have a "British" accent when you speak Japanese?  Can they tell you're from the UK when you speak?  Just wondering.
日本人ですが毎日見てますよ！！！応援してます！  I'm watching this mainly for listening practice. I'm learning English. It's good opportunity to realize how great our Japanese culture is. Keep going!
Can you make vid on Shizuoka Prefecture ?
What I absolutely love about Japan is, how adequately they can turn any common/prosaic/possibly uninteresting activity into celebration and art. As here, you never "just" drink water in Japan. You are uniting with universe by drinking it.
Ryotaro is the best guest. I always make a point to watch the videos he's in. Honestly, if a travel vid doesn't have Ryotaro in it, I don't watch it
13:55 is that anchovy as chopstick holder? 👀
We want Natsuki and Ryotaro both in the next video. Please!
Clearly Aboard in Japan
The Legendary Drunk Master Ryotaro
I like drunk Ryotaro.
That pork looks incredible
It's been a pleasure to watch Your videos. I love your humor, I love Japan I love good quality videos with good commentary, and Your channel can provide me every one of these things. Congratulations on 2 mil sub mile stone and I hope You will get even more in the future!
Can't wait for the culinary delights in the next episode of "A Board in a Pan"!
Ryotaro: The Beef Denier.
Congratz with the bigass milepole! And my favorite thing to do there would be to drink the sake there bcs i have that brand here in the netherlands and i love the warm and rich ricewine with fruits in it. Obviously i wanna drink that in japan with an amazing view and some niceass looking niku!!
Woooooow chris is so ruuude for no particular reason😠😡
10:36 "Hey, you. You're finally awake." moment
Ryotaro is the real MVP 🇯🇵😎
This is like quintessential Abroad in Japan. Awkward English from people, lots of food, Ryotoro being Ryotoro, beautiful Japanese things. Congrats on 2 mill.
gunma!!!
This entire video was awesome, but that tonkatsu...dear god! 🤤 I want to go back to Japan right f***ing now!
Pork Tactics 🐖
Congrats, Chris. Abroad in Japan is easily one of my most favorite channels. It's always great to see the content you make. Keep up the good work!
The food and inn looked amazing, that's what I'd like to try the most!
I like how you got rid of the camera man when you two stayed at the inn. Where did the poor lad go?
All these vids gets me the same vibes as all those early 2000 travel shows which you cant find on tv anymore. Great stuff.
Man... I miss Japan....
All muslims watching this right now are probably skipping this trip xD
Ryotaro is so funny when he's drunk hahahaa🤣
I need to know what's the name of that sake with the rabbit and moon on the label at 14:53 heeelp
Congratulations! Another great episode. Thanks for taking us on another ride with Ryotaro.
Pork Tactics. The new strategy game where you play as Emperor Ryotaro and his swine army as he tries to conquer the snowy region of Gunma.
best youtube channel
You need God repent of your sins
Ryotaro is so trashed hahaha
Fresh mountain spring water, simply the best water, not too many germs I presume
I've been watching your videos for years and I just noticed you are left handed too lmao
"I heard that Japanese people change a lot when they drunk"   Ryotaro went from English accented Japanese man to totalitarian overlord when he's *"Slightly Drunk"*
I'd love to see ryotaro join the podcast for one or two shows
jokes asides, Abroad in Japan wouldn't be the same without ryotaro.
America: Don't drink the river water Japan: Drinks water from a stream with a champagne glass
Like Scotland Scotch brewery i watched on tv the other day ..water from natural spring...
love your briish humour
Why are you so negative all the time chris
I just want Chris to heart this comment yo... Love yo vids from Minnesota!
Ryotoro is so drunk, it’s funny
Honestly, I sing Don't Cry For Me Argentina too whenever I'm on a balcony like that. And then wave at the peasants below.
Whenever I see your videos I wonder how someone can enjoy being in Japan that much. Being here for one and half year now I have never been more depressed and isolated in my whole life. Seems like hell and heaven are pretty close to each other.
I always forget that Chris actually speaks Japanese
I'm sorry Ryotaro but everyone knows that we subscribed because of Natsuki.. Still likes you better than Chris tho..
I am curious, did you try any unfiltered sake?
Probably shouldn't have clicked on this video on 3 AM with nothing in the fridge.
Now we need all of Chris friends in one video 😂
The perfect blend of banter and educational. Amazing video.  Besides, that guy's name Ryotaro, it doesn't get any cooler than that.
I’ll randomly start singing  don’t cry for me Argentina all the time. I love that he started singing that. Immediately liked the video 😂
The best part was watching Ryotaro secretly eyeing a tree to so he could pee in the forest.
So is Chris dating Joey or Ryotaro now?
I need more Ryotaro singing Evita on balconies 😁
Me at 12am: I should go to sleep  Me at 3am: 5:36
Cute matching outfits
no me jodas, minuto 6, es una mila de cerdo !!!!!?
Insert skyrim meme
Congratulations on your subscribers.  Your videos are educational and entertaining.  Two very important aspects of a great video.
Ryotaro is great.
The views are the best
Damn, the Kyoto video and then this? Chris where are these bangers coming from?
God, Japan looks like such a blast every time I see your videos. I'm so jealous!
Meanwhile upstream: *(Fox takes a long bathroom break)*
The  Pork Tactics bit made me smile.
Ryotaro is funny, I like him but I miss Natsuki he's way more fun.
0:16 similar energy as the "look at this dude" meme: https://youtu.be/NOaSdO5H91M?t=4
The reason Chris will not share a room with Ryotaro is that they might have a sudden swordfight with Chris' BroadSword.
please tell me thats Khruangbin being played in the back around 16 minutes in!?!???!?!/!?!?!
ABOARD in JAPAN
Listen, Ryutaro's videos might not get tons of views, but we love him nonetheless! Thanks for the great video!
Are you saying that he is advancing his pork tactics by speaking the tactical language while sleeping?
Really want to know who was watching this video while ironically drinking Mizubasho sake without knowing it would feature the Mizubasho sake brewery. I was delightfully surprised I could experience this through one of my favorite youtubers.
Congrats on the 2M subscribers!
Tengus
Drunk Ryotaro is best Ryotaro.
Another dramatic entrance by Ryotaro accompanied by evil laughter.  Excellent.
Congratulations Chris for your 2M subscribers!! I specially like these videos you make from your trips ( I love how your 4k videos look on my TV), I also enjoy how the presence of your different companions give each video a slightly different feel. Keeup up the great work.
fun video!
I'd love to visit but not in winter.
being a dick to Ryotaro became old after the first time, now it's just forced and feels a little mean spirited now, like the Karen at work who can't stop making snide remarks. Made this hard to watch
congratulation for 2million subscribers
💖
Good thing it was a self driving car, if it wasn't, Ryotaro would've gotten a DUI!
Wait Chris is left handed
I would really like to try the food in Japan.
Congratulations on hitting 2 million subscribers!  That's  a very impressive achievement!
Jeeez! Risotoro is so handsome 😍
Is there some deep lore on why Ryotaro can't drink consistently? Or did I misunderstand what they were saying in the ryokan?
I always look forward to these videos. The composition of each is so well done; the music, the cinematography, and the seamless shift between heart-to-heart banter and sweeping shots of Japan are really uniquely assembled. I know that making these videos is a job and all, but I am glad to see that you guys continue to find the process enjoyable and rewarding. There's a lot of passion that goes into these. Glad to be along for the ride! Congrats on the 2 million subscribers!
I know we've memed the shit out of Chris getting fat already, but doesn't he look extra fat in this video?
always great content! thanks!
Hang on so, abroad in Japan isn’t Ryotaro’s channel? I though Chris was just the editor or something.
Drunk Ryotaro is hilarious. Should have drink more until the ambulance come and pick him up!
I gave it a try making sukiyaki after you brought it up in your previous video. Quite a nice dish! I also like that you took the moment to address the name of the chop sticks holder, could do with more of these moments in your videos >:3 after all its more than just seeing places :D we wanna learn all the more about japan! I hope this comment can lend some nice inspiration towards your future!
Ryotaro the best thing about the video.
We need more drunk rissotoro
That pork is so high quality that it almost looks like beef when it's raw
Abroad in Japan the hot springs episode
Congrats sir on 2M subs, I've been following you for quite a while on both the youtube and podcast channels and its been both equally entertaining and enlightening. Your filmmaking and storytelling has improved so much over the years and I just wanted to reach out and let you know it IS noticed and much appreciated. Well deserved, on to 3M.
Hey, can we see you visit the lesser known islands some time? :) Bring Ryotaro along for the company. :P
I lost my shit when Chris pushed Ryotaro in the closet
Ryotaro is as good a friend as one can wish for
Again, thanks for the demonstration of the high ceilings! Lol! I think my husband will fit.
I burst out laughing when Ryotaro started singing Evita
To the question of what I'd like to try, I can only answer: "yes". Lovely to see Ryotaro again, he is always a blast of fresh air. I envy you the spring water sake, not to mention all the other sake, yes, I like sake, it is however hard to find at any great variety in Denmark. Ah well, I get to live vicariously through you vids.
Like the suit, Chris! You have an Orson Welles-type aesthetic going on. :)
Interesting ! At which company did you work and where did you stay in Germany ?
What was the best part of your video you asked? Ryotaro :D   ♥♥♥  Congrats to 2 Million subscribers, well deserved and here is to another 2 Million in 2 years (no pressure) ☼☺☼
Poor Ryotaro with the sake :( (Podcast for context)
Love the videos, lads.
Drunk Ryotaro = Good Content
Ryotaro learnt how to speak English but not how to use chopsticks.
Ryotato on Sake (rice alcohol) makes him Risottoro
Doesnt天狗 mean sky dog
Sake, fancy dinner, an amazing room with built in onsen, and singing on the balcony? Sounds like some tactical porking if you ask me.
Legends say, youll find a Hachiroku delivering tofu so fast, that it must be self driving
Ryotaro. He's precious, isn't he. What a precious person.
Omg that fried pork looked soooo good! 🤤😩💜 I’m making a note on all the food places I want to visit, so keep it coming Chris! 😂 Ryotaro is so fun, he really compliments you :)
Didn't expect Ryotaro signing Don't Cry For Me Argentina. Congrats for 2 million subscribers and greetings from Argentina 🇦🇷🇦🇷
So happy for you. I got some glee watching you drink that Spring water and sake
If somebody doesn't start a band called Pork Tactics it'll be a cultural tragedy.
Man, I love the ryokan aesthetic so much!  I also love seeing you and Ryotaro bouncing off of each other's energy, had me laughing quite a bit!
next time Im in Japan I would like to meet Ryotaro, he's kinda funny no offense to you Chris
Please more videos with ryotaro, nice hotels, food and drinking alcohol! This is the best kind of video
I'm crushing on Ryotaro like a 18 year old. Funny, handsome and a beautiful singing voice...sigh..
I like Ryotaro's way of dressing. The man has style.
I need more onsen or sento videos pronto.
I think I'm most amused by the intentional facing of the beer label by Ryotaro at about the 18min mark.
TO answer your question Chris? **EVERYTHING**
TONKATSU!!!!!!!!!!!! I love tonkatsu. I need to learn a better recipe for the batter. I love to make Japanese inspired dishes with my own spin on them. Today I made a sweet teriyaki beef and rice with various vegetables in my wok. I look forward to getting to Japan and learning many new recipes. Including proper tonkatsu!
The music in the beginning, i absolutely love the beat, very well done!!
Ma sbaglio o si é incicciottito parecchio?
Thankyou for always creating the best content! Been watching for years, definitely a comfort youtuber ☺️ Steadily saving up to go to Japan🙌
the food looks reely good
Demon Slayer is all I got to say
Their back and forth is really entertaining
Looks like an amazing experience drinking sake in the forest!
What impressed me was drinking sake in the forest, but what I would likely be doing the next visit to japan is eating tonkatsu.
Congrats on being the big limey in the land of the rising sun and breaking the 2 million subscriber threshold ! I think you were only around 220K, when I subscribed. Your content has been both informative and and entertaining with many humorous moments. Your sidekick minions play a big part and Ryotaro is one funny dude. Well done. Keep em coming !
Gawd, I wish you were gay.
Pork tactics , Kobe strategy , tuna projects and Sake plots ....that might make the greatest difference about a peaceful culture of the Japanese life among many other different parts of the world .
Genuinely the best of water ive ever had was from the top of a frozen welsh mountain  Yes ofcourse the added blend of sheep shit was fantastic,
👺
I want that tonkatsu 😋
Please get Ryotaro drunk more often. That was hilarious to see his tipsy side. That aside its a fantastic place, love the winter landscape from the ryokan, not to mention the assortment of sake and of course the food. Great work and again congratulations with the 2 million mark!
Ryotaro can now take his rightful place and title: Daimyo-taro. He has ascended.
Sexy intro
I really wanna see a video like this with Connor
Ryotaro seems almost like a child when he's drunk. lol
Everything looked great and while I've never spouted a descriptor bound to be on ballcaps and t-shirts like "Pork Tactics", i do tend to eat tactically - making sure I save the last mouthful to be whatever was the best on the plate.
Dam, these videos are so much of a documentary, great quality, always love them.
Sometimes I forget how hard Cris his burns can be towards Ryotaro 😂
Congratulations Chris! Well done you.
I love it when you speak japanese!
Drunktaro and his excellent pork tactics. Shame how he got himself run over by a slow moving golf cart.
I LOVE how you listed all the locations you visited!!
Pork Tactics is my new favorite phrase.
"The roof requires lot of maintanence and you need to repair it every 30 40 years"😂😂
was that an ainu dress at 10:08
As a right-handed person whos married to a left-handed person I can assure you, that we did in fact not figured this table war out yet (7 years and counting). It happens fairly often that we switch seats mid-meal :D
I've said this before, but Ryotaro looks more Maori than Japanese.
“He’s won at life” says the guy who gets to travel all around Japan for a living 😉  -Sincerely, Someone who has to sit in an office all day
request; plan an event, where you send a package with chosen sake /food, and we can taste it with you live. :D
Drunk Ryotaro is like sober Natsuki
I will one day go back to Japan and go to the places you visited, eat the food you ate and drink the sake and beer you drank. Congratulations on 2M subs!
thanks for the free tour and trip!!
americans be like "i like what i see till the chef uses his hands without gloves on foods."
I'm underage
I love this video! Pork Tactics! Pork Tactics! I'm using this everyday!
Amazing content video..love it
Drunk Ryotoro is my new favorite thing to watch 🤣🤣🤣
Tonkatsu definitely. I'm ashamed to admit the only time I got to spend in Japan was during my fish obsession. So I was constantly visiting local fish and sushi bars on the constant, though visiting the fish markets in Tokyo was especially cool! I can only hope I'm able to return to Japan one day, I really miss it!
Im I the only one disappointed they didn't get into onsen? ;D
🍶What a bunch of pork-tacstic forFsake drunkards! 2M Congratulations 👏   *at least em not some soda jerks. 🥤
If they changed places at the table, they would be a single entity: hashioki devouring monster.
The Donkatsu...my god, that looked divine.
Imagine an animal peeing into the stream just as you take a glass of the water downstream wonder how many more animals peed in it or even excreted in it........🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤
Drunk tactics
Ryotarto must be fun to get drunk with.
Ryotaro seems genuinely happy and excited about your achievement, it's honestly heartwarming to see.
lol, drunk Ryotaro is hilarious
americans are not tall, they are just wide...
Where is natsuki :(
We love Ryotaro yeah :)
I think Ryotaro getting clipped by the golf cart would've made my day !  Beautiful spot, very jealous. Would have liked to see more of your meal, that sukiyaki looked good as did the sake. Good stuff as always and well done on the 2m+...
I didnt get the name of the hotel?
Wow! Congratulations! And thanks again for another wonderful video. Those places look beautiful. ^^ Thank you for sharing this with us.
That escalated quickly...
more drunk Ryotaro please.
A board in Japan and his his trusty Pork tactics
I live in Tokyo and really want to do a brewery tour in the countryside but the problem is you need a designated driver. How do you guys manage to travel around there? It's even hard to find taxis out there most of the times.
I definitely wanted to try the sake! Such a wonderful video! The room and bath were beautiful! ♡ Ryotaro drunk (ish) was too funny XD. Also that spring water looked amazing.
2nd restaurant still sitting on the wrong side LOL
Ryotaro- they don’t have a ritual to drinking beer 🍺 that’s what straight up drinker would say.
$250 for all of that is actually quite cheap if you think about it
Damn why did this come out only now?? I went to Gunma last year but didn't know they have amazing tonkatsu!
the first 2 seconds felt like an answer to the title
Enjoying My Quality time in YT
aBOARD in Japan ;)
You are getting fatter again, chris-chan
"Dave, we have Onsen!" -Ryotaro, 2021
i never knew i could need drunk ryotaro videos until today
チャンネル登録２００万人突破、おめでとうございます！ !(^∀^)! イエ～イ
You packed on at least 35 pounds.
Chris and Ryotaro have a great frienemy relationship. Best YouTube duo.
I want that mask and I want to go there
So you're basically eating Schnitzel! :D
Found Chris through Trash Taste and I was like 'wow this guy sounds  even better than CDawgva. Now I'm like 'woah Ryotaro sounds so much better than Chris'.
I love these videos! So want to travel to Japan and perhaps meet you and the team, if I'm lucky enough!
Great episode!
Thanks for allowing us to watch you get pissed on camera -  you deserve 2 million viewers Chris Bored !!
Drunk Ryotaro was something I never knew I needed to see, yet here I am, enjoying every second.
Congratulations..  I have always wanted to go to Japan and after watching your shows I got the courage to start learning the language and go. It was the best trip I've ever had.
Just pray that so-called fresh water from that stream didn't include urine from other tourist.
I'm surprised you haven't gone to Atami yet.
I gotta get my Pork tactics down asap
i had to pause when ryotaro said "the thing is, right" cause his accent disappeared and he sounded like a friend of mine
Does Ryotaro  have a work?
I love the Ryotaro/Chris duo. Their comedy together is gold
This looks like just the best day ever
沼田のトンカツとみやですね、分厚いトンカツで有名です、関越道も見えて見晴らしの良いですよね。
New video from I'm bored in Japan, oh boy!
Looks like you had a great time! Keep it up, and congratulations with the 2M subs!
😁😂https://youtu.be/Tl-Wou65yYQ
There is a video game that you start by sitting in a cart waiting for something to happen. Chris is dragonborn confirmed
Chris, you are living the life 🙌.  Congratulations 👏
#askabroad do you actually plan your intros? They're very cool!! Or do you do it on the go?  I really wanna learn do it
ooh, guess which video made it on trending in australia?! great job chris, another amazing quality video for us all ❤
Congratulations on 2m subs man ! Keep up the good work :D
Chris, I feel like you missed the second most important part of Ryotaro. How big was his hangover next morning?
"lets do something different and get drunk in a forrest" little does he know that in the UK this is a normal thing to do until the age of 18 lol
All Germans watching the end be like: NEVER drink a Weizen out of the bottle. Its verboten, VERBOTEN!
2 videos in less than a week for 2 million subscribers!? Let's freaking goo! Ryotaro being on the channel gets extra points from me. Also I've been watching the channel for at least 6 years now and I only just learnt that Chris is left-handed
Sir I am from India and Your big fan  I want to learn Japanese without school by only self study I request you to Please make a video on this topic 🙏
Ryotaro acts like a dad when he got home after drinking with boss and the crew
The day I can live like this, I will have won at life.
I love drunk Ryotaro, his energy goes from 100 to 200
So who is the sugar daddy.
I like it warm or cold sake is beautiful.
congratulations on the 2m! ! sugoi !
I love sake .I cant have sushi without sake.fish is beautiful with sake .
I love you both so much .best men👍
Ryotaro transforms into safari man when he's drunk
Congratulations Ryotoro on the 1.5mil 👍🏻
This is the most I've seen Chris use his Japanese so causally in his videos. It's only taken him 100 years to do so! LOL!
i miss hate comment of the week , when you bringing it back?
Congrats Chris! and OMG I hope Ryotaro fully understands your on camera persona is just joking with him. To someone who hasn't followed you from the beginning like I have, they'd probably be very concerned that you hate Ryotaro! LOL
I came here for tipsy Ryotaro. Did not leave disappointed.
Aboard in Japan?
Love the Chris and Ryotaro dynamic
What is the pot in the middle of the table and how is it used?
I like Ryotro more!!
the sake are or tonkatsu looks like the best thing to experience, that in looks so expensive but for 250 thats actually so fair in price
i have questions.
At least Ryotaro is a happy drunk.
The video quality I feel is what Norm always tries for but falls short of.
Congratulations on 2 million subscribers
What is the name of the saki with the bunny and the moon on the label?
I'm drooling over all this delicious looking food. But I must say, for Ryotaro been to Germany I'm kind of disappointed he drinks "Weizen" out of the bottle.
The sake in the woods experience and that tonkatsu!!!! Need to go there
I love that you go to all these places that visitors might not think of, most people only think of Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto, etc Edit: Drunk Ryotaro is the best Ryotaro lol
“Pork Tactics” 🤣
Man give Re some Alcohol and he becomes animated. Lol
Isn't there a herbal drink to help with hangovers they sell in japan
Is Ryotaro single?! ahha!
I sub to Abroad in Japan coz of Ryotaro and Natsuki
Abroad in Japan the video game!
"Will Gunma be alright?"
I wonder how the sake would taste slightly warmed?
I cant be the only one who thought of clockwork orange with those masks
Sit on my face and tell me that you love me. Lmao
Your show is one of the best on Youtube! Entertaining, informative, and binge worthy. #8moreyears hahaha
"Pork Tactics" YOU'VE ACTIVATED MY TRAP CARD, the real pork tactic is to nibble on the fat part of the pork every now and again, so the whole pork gets elevated and you don't get a mouthful of fat at once
Congratulations on 2 million subs!!! I have been watching your channel for about 5 years or so and really enjoy your content. Keep up the good work. Best wishes
I would eat that sardine. Seeing Ryotaro do it lessens my embarrassment..
Chris is left handed? Explains a lot
If that room is $250 a night it sure looks like it's worth it!
I think Chris is the most popular youtuber for Japanese travel because he's willing to tell us how things actually are.   Unlike all of the others, where every single thing they do or eat is like 9 or 10/10 even if you can see on their face that it's a 4/10
5:48 damn that oil is dark
To say I'm jealous is an understatement.
Congratulations on the new milestone. I can say with my hand on my heart that for you, this is a well-earned one. I look forward to seeing you reach the next!
Subbed for for your friends. :P
Chris speaking Japanese is so hot idk why
That sake must have been hitting quite nice 🤣🤣
personally Chis i don't know. how you stay even in the average UK, shape you are in when eating and drinking so much good food. its amazing you do stay in shape.   i think my favorite was the pork cutlet  meal. i am going to keep watching and hopefully visit all the places you have shown!!  KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!! :)
I love seeing Ryotaro goof around in the house
Drunk Ryotoro was the best part
I will like to try some pork tactics.Why do they roast each other.
Congrats to Abroad in Japan for 2 million subs!!   So many years of hard work and fantastic videos finally paying off!   AND another great video, and amazing work, and as always love watching Chris and Ryotaro enjoying the finer things Japan has to offer!   Would love to get my hands on some of that Nagai Brewery saki!  wow!       Also looking forward to the sub-channel, "Pork Tactics"!!
For the sake of Ryotaro like and share it make it go viral
Jesus Christ loves you greatly. Repent brothers and sisters and accept him as your Lord and Savior. The Great Tribulation is upon us and once it begins grace will have expired but he promises a heavenly inheritances to those who surrender and give their life to him while there is time. Repent friends for time is shorter than you think!!
We need a video of Ryotaro and Natsuki out drinking. I'd love to see how they change after a few drinks.
Ryotaro with a big drink puddle next to him at the end of the video.  Love it.
I wanna try sake so much 😍
Congrats on 2 million subscribers! Your channel has incredible production quality and you should be proud!
Chris deserves more subscribers
Congrats!
Too bad we cannot go to Japan .  Keep up the videos
Buzzed Ryotaro is best Ryotaro!
12:00 "Slightly drunk", is he? :p
Hello Chris! Dont get fat like me! I am getting fat right now and It`s feeling like I have to workout FOREVER now! Instead of eating all the times, lets go together outside of! Have a good day at a lonely beach instead! I wonder myself about all the secret nature places in japan!  PM! Dont show the locations or it will be ran over soon maybe! I just want to see the beauty of japan!
I think Drunk Ryotaro should be the narrator of all the videos from now on.
Hmmm... Chris Board... A Board in Japan...
Absolutely gorgeous locations and that tonkatsu looked delicious. If I ever make it to Japan for a trip I'll be sure to try some.
Why did you bring me here?... "It's creepy innit?" Ryotaro picking up British dialect 😂
Hell of an achievement. Congrats ☺
I think it’s the wonderful friendship you have with your Japanese / Japanese-speaking friends that attracts so many subscribers. Your videos are also getting better and better, almost like national geographic but better with sake and nice food 🍱
Chris you're looking mega fab in the video, fittttttt AF! seriously hyping for a visit to Japan after lockdown! keep up the vibe dude <3 xx
Wow, beautiful experiences, taste experiences, and a very bumpsy Ryotaro.
Gotta love Ryotaro
Onegaishimas to His Highness Emperor Ryotaru for all the views and his appearances!:))
pro pork plays right here
Why you drink the beer from the bottle. Why.
Chris mate! You’re trending on YouTube! (#47 in America at the time of writing). That’s amazing! Congratulations! It’s been amazing seeing the channel grow over the past two years that I’ve been subbed.
You’re just getting to these numbers? And I’ve been subscribed since Chris decided to teach Japanese people how to swear.  Congratulations 🎉🎉👏🏼👏🏼
Congrats!!!!
Always a joy to watch your content, Chris. Never stop doing what your doing, man, its quite the entertainment and quite the adventure. Can't wait to have my own visit Japan one day.
Ryotaro being called Chris' sugar daddy in the comments is incredible, I love it here
What a wonderful way to celebrate 2 million subs! Congratulations! 🎊 👏👏👏 hard to say what was my favorite part, but if I must pick...the drinking next to the stream was pretty cool. I'm a simple man. Anyway thanks for taking us along on your little celebration! 🥳
They have a drawer full of breadcrumbs lol
All the lefty’s in the house thumbs up!!👍
I'm just wondering if all Abroad on japan videos are ads now.
Man, Ryotaro has such a kind and fun personality. And he always tries his best to be the perfect host to Chris and show him (and us) the top best of Japan. Keep the content with him coming, Chris!
Two words regarding that hotel. Bucket List! Great video!
Congratulations, Chris! Been loving your videos since the day I discovered your channel. Thank you for showing Japan to us. I miss Japan sooo much.
Pork tactics sounds like something you plan before a night out
Alarm, da wird Weizen aus der Flasche getrunken! Eine Einreise in die BRD ist damit für Sie offiziell ausgeschlossen!
Greetings from Germany. Where does Ryotaro work?
What happened to natsuki?
Only just found this channel and definitely subscribing.
it's always a pleasure to see Rissottaro in a board in japan video
The sardine chopstick holder absolutely KILLED ME 💀
lol, this was a delight to watch! Best of luck to Ryotaro on his alcohol restriction but it was still nice to see him kick back here. :)
this is what happens when you load Natsuki OS into Ryotoro computers.
Pork tactics as a life motto.
Love you Chris! Mind you, I do expect you'll meet up with me for dinner and drinks on my next trip to Japan, as thanks for my loyalty! (I'll foot the bill; any place of your choosing!)
Gotta love how Ryotaro said don't sit to the left of a left-handed person and then did it again at the next restaurant aye
A fellow left handed person?
Wow, you can really tell the video quality when they're drinking sake outside :o The footage from 5:07 to 5:16 is stuh-ning!!! Also, congrats on 2m Chris :D
Somehow most people think we Germans are all Bavarians. Like we have Oktoberfest (Bavarian beer festival) in the whole country or every German citizen owns a dirndl (Bavarian clothing). But it's only in Bavaria, which is only a part of Germany, where they have such customs. So it's not like in Germany you have to drink beer regularly or every day. It would be totally fine to be at a party and not get drunk or drink any alcoholic beverage at all. It's totally up to everyone to decide for themselves.
Literally all of the food, architecture, people, and scenery in this video just re emphasize my love for Japan and how much I want to experience it myself
I need to see Chris drunk.
Man, I'd really love to hang out with these two. Also, I love how Chris has a very british drinking behaviour when speaking English and when he switches to Japanese he does the most gentle clink with his cute little cup.
Gintama is taking a piss on the top silently
I feel this channel really took off after Ryotaro's 'deer bear boar' rap song on the 10 Jan episode.
Congratulations on the 2 million subscriber milestone Chris!
Congrats on the 2 mil "viewers" (how Risottoro keeps calling them, lol :P). You guys are amazing, and as usual the video is just fantastic. Not a single one of those subbers is undeserved!! :3 *PS don't show Ryotaro this comment, it's better to keep him on edge and pretend he's someone of no importance :P
I just love the quality of the video, nice takes, and that tonkatsu looks amazing.
Best part is a drunk Risotoro
When I cook pork at home here in Texas, I cut the ends off for me and my wife eats the lean. We were made for each other.
I’d pay to see more videos of Chris and Ryotaro having a roasting session. Seriously, the comedic golds are all there.
Ryotaro drunk singing Evita. Yep level clearred.
I love drunk Ryotaro, he's even more fun.
Love your videos. If possible could you run your audio through a high pass filter? I usually watch on my TV / home theatre setup and a lot of the audio is very boomy, need to cut out the sub bass frequencies.
Something about this episode just got me so excited. Maybe it’s just knowing that there was an accomplishment being celebrated..? Either way super excited to see this video!! Got me enthused even more!!
I like drunk Ryotaro! Better!
What's the significance of the rabbits on the Sake bottles?
I like how this video was shot. All the shots are so pretty :)
Lol
Does anyone know the song or soundtrack in 2:30 ?
One thing that I am asking myself is, how dead you both were the day after.
Drunk Ryotaro: the movie
I'm liking Ryotaro more and more :)))
I love the channel, Ryotaro is always a great guest; sometimes I wonder why Chris speaks negatively of him at times.. I’m sure he’s just playing around, I wonder what their relationship is like behind the scenes, because Ryotaro always seems pleasant and kind to me..
Congrats on 2M!
That Insuite Onsen looks amazing. You have a great tour guide with Ryotaro XD
you gotta stop being so mean to poor Ryotaro! He is the best!
Best part: Ryotaro singing "Don't cry for me Argentina" off the balcony.
Let this sink into your minds       Eternal life can only be achieved in this lifetime.The afterlife is eternal so hell and heaven are eternal. God gave us Jesus Christ to be the final sacrifice for our sins. Those who refuse this gift go to a place where they reap what they have sown in this life. There is never any rest for an unrepentant sinner! Live holy as God is holy and repent!
Chris: We are going to drink the water out of a champagne glass. [ Taylor Swift’s champagne problems start playing in the background ] meanwhile, the glass in question: * starts to sweat nervously * Hope no one tells him I’m a wine glass
Love your channel.  You should visit Niigata Prefecture and show where the insanely expensive Koi fish come from.  Not unheard of for a single fish to sell for $250,000 US.  Go during the Ojiya Matsuri three-day summer festival held annually in Ojiya.
Everytime Ryotaro is in Abroad in Japan, I feel bad for Chris...    It must be hard spending all the trip being jealous of a man as perfect as Ryotaro
You deserve way more than 2 million subs, Chris. Thank you not only for sharing an intricate culture but amazing content you create. You're slowly getting there.
Very proud of you chirs, I remember when you were in your first apartment and your students called you "Chris hotdog".
Congratulations on the milestone Chris! Hope to see more of your fun and awesome videos in the future too :D
Awesome ryotaro glad you took "dave" out lol
Where can I buy Nagai sake in the US?
When you're not using disposable paper packaging or even a block of wood, but rather a whole fish to hold your chopsticks, you know you've ascended to glory.
Great video!!
...I continually get the impression that Ryotaro is just...not quite Bezos rich...but closer to that than the common man.
this is good stuff!
2 vids in 5 days!?!?!??!
Sukiyaki ftw. Great to see Tonkatsu without mayo.
I would really enjoy a Podcast where theres more in depth conversations of you guys talking or other friends of Chris.
6:21 Well, can't be that good if he didn't say justice delicious... (I'm just coping... 🤤 I wanna eat that so baaaaad)
6:09 that's what she said
Wait, I think I recognize that ryokan from one of Sharla's videos! Or perhaps one similar.
ahh yes i love watching Aboard In Japan
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates⭕️
We have reached peak Ryotaro with 'Drunk Ryotaro', WE complete the videogame!
"Wooooowlookahtha" Drunk Ryotaro is a gem
👍
The best part is Drunk Ryotaro! And of course the food...😊🥰😋
I don’t think any eating strategy will ever come close to pork tactics..
It is refreshing to hear you speaking more Japanese to the local people.
Chris's tailspin into alcoholism and obesity is well on it's way. It's certainly enjoyable to watch. P.S. To Reotoro (any anyone really): If you snore deeply and loudly you should very seriously consult a doctor who can recommend you a breathing assisting machine. Having breathing difficulties during sleeping can actually lead to long term health problems! Please seek medical advice from an actual media doctor (not a quack). There's nothing from from at least being informed.
Just went vegan 3 days ago, fk me I'm dying over here xD GIVE ME SOME PORK TACTICS FFS Brother!!
Best video so far wish I could enjoy this
I suggest that starting from today everyone call you Broad-san (16:33)
Don't tell Ryotaro, but your videos get bonus points from having him. What kind of bonus? I don't know, but he is something xD Congratulations on the success of the channel mate! Keep it going!
Pork Tactic should make it as one of your t-shirt designs
When the Gaijin from Ryotaro's channel teaches you a few new Japanese words :0
Pork tactics!
i love these video's with Ryotaro, they are so funny. Thanks for all your amazing video's this makes my list just bigger what to do in Japan when i will go. Greeting Dutch girl in Sweden.
I really miss Wakkanai and Tomamae
Came for the Hot Spring, stayed for the Pork Tactics.
“COORS” always brags about their pure Rocky Mountain Water........I’ll bet anything they can’t complete with this Sake Brewer!
Chris, while you're up in Gunma you really need to check out Kusatsu, its such an amazing little village with an awesome town square and massive open air hotsprings. I stayed at a ryokan there which had a private onsen inside the hotel room. Also Shibukawa is another great place to visit, especially for fans of the anime Initial D. Can visit all the spots from the show and go up the mountain there where they raced. :)
"It's the pairing, and I need to pair it" -Ryotaro, 2021
Loving these videos
So that’s what this emoji is 👺
Germany here: don't drink the weizen from the bottle 😨
Hey Chris, pls do a trip for Soy Sauce, the real ones brewed in Wood Barrels. Thanx man
Ah yes, my favorite channel, A Board in Japan.
Pork tactics. Especially coz I don’t eat meat or fish at least I can enjoy you guys having these kind of feasts!
I just love how the production quality keeps increasing every video rather subtly
That tonkatsu looks unbelievable
Thankyou chris for your content! I have trouble sleeping at most nights until I watch your content before I go to sleep. Watching you is like you telling me a story about japan until I go to sleep. Dont get me wrong, I love your content and humour, it is just that watching your channel is very calming :)) keep it up!
Always enjoy the shows Chris! Congrats!
I need a PORK TACTICS sticker in my life
13:13 Argentinian here... I laughed so much, it was so unexpected hahah
Drunk Ryotaro should happen more often.
You've put on so much weight
i'm afraid to admit my love for a certain man. simply cause i might get banned.
Drunk Risottoro is best Risotorro!
I don't think we've seen Ryotaro this drunk....
tenga temple? very epic
Ryotaro is such a daddy
Did anybody make this joke yet: A pork in Japan?  Sorry for my awful humor. Bye.
Maybe I will start calling Japanese people hobits too
Other establishments DO feature the source of their water--often bubbling somewhere on their premises.
I admire their friendship, like here let's push you in the closet Ryotaro. Chris and Ryotaro are friendship goals!
270 million views. you are fantastic
18:06 how many beers has it been since you started the channel ;D
Oh yes, a new episode of Aboard in Japan!
That pork dish 😋 Ryotaro is hilarious! Love watching him in your videos. Loved the spring water too! Congratulations on your milestone!! 2m.
Congratulations 🎊 here’s to more millions
“As you can see, Ryotaro is slightly drunk”  ...slightly?
ngl kinda breaks my heart when you insult ryotaro. I know you're joking, but gd chilll a bit
I don’t even eat the edge with the fat. I don’t like it.
👺👺👺
great video again thanks for that you carry on Chris. Just one suggestion if I can please. It's little bit like sausage party, some local girls to get involved would be nice though .
ngl kinda like drunk ryotaro
Man, I wish I had a mate like Ryotaro to banter with. He's a real one.
Im LOVING those videos, proud Patreon since 2016-17.
waw
10:34 hey, you're finally awake
Porn tactics
Chris and Ryotaro in the same video huh? I can already hear the sarcasm before clicking play
You got me at tonkatsu and sake! :D
Summary of this video: 2 guys getting food and drinking sake afterwards and in the evening doing both at the same time. Love it
Today abroad in japan will be like 😊😊🤗 after  drinking  and ❤👍👍
I thought you were supposed to drink sake alone in a cramped apartment... or is that just me...
Congrats on 2M subscribers!! Very well deserved <3 Greetings from Greece
Thank you for another great video and congratulations on 2M ! You deserve it !
"Pork Tactics" I hear a new T-shirt coming up!
Gunma, isn't that the setting for Initial D? I swear😂 anime is just a veiled tour guide through Japan.
Not gonna lie....I'm hardcore shipping chris and risotarro. Maybe Chris + Risotarro = Chrisotarro??? <3 <3 <3
I'm adding "go to Japan and get drunk in a forest" to my bucket list!
I mean "pork tactics" is worth at least 2 subscribers.
Looking fat bruv
Ryotaro as Charity project? Naa can't be. He is my favorit "guest" star. Yes i know, not nice to pick favorits but i have. Live with it  😂 You two should do as me and my youngest do. He is right handed and i am left. He sits on my right side. That way we can freely let our elbows stick out as much as we want to. Without poking each other.   Looks silly if taken to fare. But who cares. I thought, i was the only person who still makes breaded pork. I do not know anyone else who does. In Denmark it is called Paneret Koteletter. Mums if made right. PS: I want a Ryotaro in my life. Snoring and all
Congratulations, Chris.  Greetings from Edinburgh. I started getting involved with your site when I was researching Japan for my first trip there. I’ve had a yearly holiday there since.  Anyway, as I’ve already mentioned in these messages, I have think you should send your documentaries to the BBC.  Give Stacey Dooley a run for her money.  I think you’d be fantastic.
Pork tactics. Could very well be a band name. Fits right into that list of strange band names such as Salad bar and all..
"pork tactics" is porktastic!
Drunk Ryotaro is a treasure.
Ryotoro is so 😭😭💀💀💀
You know what? Ryotaro is actually right 😀 The true reason why I subscribed to your channel is that I absolutely loved the videos of you two constantly joking about each other while travelling across Japan. Love your duo dynamics!
Can we take a minute to appreciate the lighting and cinematography of this video?? Absolutely top notch, Chris! 2 million subs well earned, mate.
Slightly drunk Ryotaro is the best Ryotaro/
Oh my God that tonkatsu looks amazing! I'm so jealous! I miss amazing Japanese food!
He hasn't his name is now Chris England.
Ryotaro is so good
Germans don't have that kind of ritual....Ryotaro I think you never worked with artisans /craftsmen . My brother had to drink with his colleagues every day after work....and not a small amount. But still, I enjoyed both of you as always :D
I'm sure you can write that trip down as a business expense.  Sometimes I resent my career choices. 😅
I think the local beer was very interesting and a beer that I want to drink.  I think everything was very interesting and appealing.  It looked relaxing and a sense of harmony. Drinking water and champagne in the nature is just wonderful.
Congrats for the 2mill subs Chris🎉🎉🎉 Thanks to Ryotaro, Natsuki, Pete, Joey, & Sharla also for their invlovement😎😎😎 That Kawaba Onsen is definitely on my wishlist for my next trip to Japan🤩🤩🤩
Notice how chris ordered an entire teishoku but only ate the meat. What a British legend!
I love how Chris almost chokes when Ryotaro first says "Pork Tactics" hahahaha
Congratulations! Well earned! ❤️❤️❤️
That lunch looked so good. With some of that excellent Sake.
Pervert nation
Finally, the hot springs episode. The main storyline was getting a bit too heavy.
The best thing out of the video definitely was drunk Risottaro.
9:00 Practising for a Television appearance?
i like pork tactics, it has a nice ring to it, definitely going to use it. regards from Denmark.
Oh no I've developed a crush on Ryotaro during this video.
Your videos have become so fantastic Chris, really. There’s just absolutely no fat to trim anywhere in the production from my point of view. When I put your videos on, I don’t want to turn away for a second.
Lmao
He had about three cups of saké and ryotaro is stumbling all over the apartment. 😂
6:09 a moment of staisfication :)
Instant like the moment I heard Ryotaro's version of Don't Cry for Me Argentina. Lol
Congratulations Chris!✨👏🏼👏🏼✨I’ve been a viewer for five years now and you and the gang make me smile each time and I look forward to seeing you all for many years to come! Love u!💜🥰💜
The pork cutlets looks the best. Thanks for the vid! Looks like lots of fun.
I'd like to have seen a quick morning after epilogue :P
solid content !
I'm glad even Ryotaro doesn't know what he's doing.
Best part was the sardine chopstick holder
You should start referring to Ryotaro as Pork Tactics. His new name. And Natsuki as Justice Delicious.
More like Jurassic Parku. :)  That ryokan looks awesome though.
Wow, makes me remember playing total war shogun 2,i wonder how does the actual war looks like in 1st person view
13:12 Ryotaro is a certified Disney Princess
This show needs to expand as a branded collaboration. Abroad in Europe, Abroad in India, Abroad in Russia, Abroad in Brazil, Abroad in China, Abroad in Thailand...
I watch these videos only for Ryotoro...or whatever that beautiful man's name is
The pork is only "heavenly". That's no way even close to "justice delicious"
Don't worry Ryotaro I won't cry for you
Congratulations on reaching 2M subscribers Chris.
Pork Tactics With Chris Bored in Japan. 2 Mill
I genuinely enjoy everything Chris puts out!! It's always a good time, makes me feel like I'm present there with him.
The best thing was the tiramisu I had while watching this video. ;P
Wow two videos in one week keep it up!!!
Well he does have an Emperor-ish face ;)
the doors at 10:05 are so traditional that it's not automatic, but with two girls opening them.
“Snow on the rice paddies... Very Japanese” 💖
Ryotaro being a literal Knobhead in that intro
Tonkatsu pork cutlet, what  fancy name for schnitzel.
i will certainly be applying pork tactics next time i have tonkatsu, it's the clear play
congrats Chris ;D
Get more riyotoro XD manz hilarious
Quite an amazing room! 250$ even sounds reasonable considering the size of it.
Drunk ryotaro must be protected at all costs
Damn....makes me both miss Japan but also like...feeling ripped off. Spent $1,400 for a hot spring experience in Kinosaki and had a 3 hour crab meal that never ended. The tatami mats reeked of crab afterwards and it was hard to sleep.... I feel like I missed out on a better cheaper experience elsewhere haha
A cuter couple than Ellen and Oprah
Lefties unite!
I just realized that Chris is left handed
Nutty me mates
That pork tactic food looked really good 👀 I’d definitely want to try it and the hot and cold sake
is it just me who never realised chris is left handed
Please make a collection of Ryotaro drunk
I am waiting for chris to go to the Nintendo headquarters or somewhere from the Nintendo world
If pork tactics is a thing, then I would eat one edge first (to start the meal well) and end it with the other edge (to end it well)
I can picture Chris having this video done with 1.99M subs and waiting to upload it. I love it Congratulations mate!
Hamtastic porktactics.
The title should be "Two drunkards went to the Inn" xD
Thank you for all of the wonderful videos! I have always dreamed of going to Japan. But due to life circumstances it is not possible for me. Your videos have made me feel like I can experience what I have only read about. You deserve every subscriber and more! Please keep up the great work! Best wishes and congratulations!
"Pork Tactics" is my new favorite expression
Lol at drunk Ryotaro. Hahahaha
Look at the way Ryotaro's slang changed to British.
That all looks so good lol Congrats on 2M you guys!
Drinking Weizen  from the Bottle ?!
My new wallpaper 5:33
Just imagine how many more subscribers you would get if Ryotaro got run over, or had to sleep on the balcony. As a team-player he should be prepared to take one for the Team.
The best part of this whole video was Emperor Risottro!
Left handed Gang!
My dream holiday😍
These guys have nailed the Top Gearesque short and punchy narration and its great!
I once read while there's a lot of alcoholic drinking, alcoholism in Japan isn't as rampant as one might think.
10:35 "Hey, you! You're finally awake..."
So, drinking water right out of a stream eh? I guess we aren't worried about giardia then.
10:50 Careful now, Ryotaro, we don't want automated Truck-kun to turn this into an Isekai now, do we?
Congratulations! I remember that first awkward video in your small apartment. I love this channel and your videos so much. They are so fun and make me want to visit Japan! I can't wait! :)
all the normies saying Demon Slayer
Been subbed since around 100k and I’ve watched every video! The quality is amazing and always rising. Keep it up Chris!
Eating pork Tonkatsu and sipping sake next to a stream in the forest sounds amazing. Congratulations on 2 million subscribers.
Mate, you've got local craft beer from Gunma prefecture and you didn't even put it in a glass. C'mon man don't drink it straight from the bottle, you can do better than that.  Best wishes, a beer-enthusiast  Oh and PS. Tipsy Ryotaro was quite the sight to behold, cheers for that 🍻
Oh look it's the Japanese Goblin emoji 👺
Want to try the ryokan
C'mon Board you're English you know exactly why "pork tactics" sounds wrong.
This was the drunkest video I’ve ever seen on YouTube. Anyway cheers for the 2M subscribers 🥳
Hi Chris! Just have to comment on how good your film-making skills are getting. The sequence at the river, though not very spectacular in nature, is so beautifully shot that it made it extraordinary. I really appreciate your effort and I truly believe it will be rewarded in your career even though Youtube algorithms most likely won't. So thanks for the effort.  Hate to get personal but I just have to say that I love Japan and I have pretty much travelled every inch of that amazing country. Even places such as Sakata, Tsuruoka and Haguro-san. This was a few years before I saw your channel, and I hate to think I might have passed you in the street without talking to you. Those days were the time of my life, but demanding relationships made me abandon my dreams. It went horribly wrong and I've fallen on some spectacularly bad times. I just have to say that your videos and the Youtube-universe they opened have meant a tremendous amount. BTW, you should Always make sure Ryotoro is drunk. He really Shines in this one!
they have matching shirts so do we ship dis?
Drinking sake in the forest where the water is sourced is exactly the type of Japan adventure I would want.
Iam German... Seee the beer... I can read Weizen (wheat beer).... I want that too...
10:33 - Hey you, you're finnaly awake.
Congratulations on 2 million subscribers that's a terrific achievement! Thanks for posting, good old Ryotaro celebrated with you but where was Natsuki?! :-)
.
Happy 2 Million, Chris! Cheers, mate - and to many more successes in the future.
Drunk Ryotaro is peak chaotic energy and I’m here for it
For some reason I was randomly unsuscribed
Congrats on 2 million. I hope to get to japan to give a botanist’s perspective of the foods and plants there once the pandemic is over.
Drunk Ryotaro is something I never knew I needed
i never seen chris so happy, maybe because of the sake(s) and the tonkatsu
About  the arm thing, just switch places?
Chris Floorboard
I like drunk ryotoro
3:35 Well, Chris is getting Broader
This is awesome
YOU'RE A LEFTIE!!!!!!!
That breaded pork cutlet looked amazing. Congrats on 2mil.
Congratulations on 2 million subs. You deserve it!
All the British watching this that got drunk in a forest as a teen... xD Not nearly as glamorous though!
豚カツ食べたくなるw
Why no, Chris, I couldn't tell Ryotaro was drunk.
The Sake Brewery Tour was the Best, Do they offer it to the public? and the Onsen looks Divine.
ryotoro has a fancy coat ! looks great it has a good fit, youres cris is kinda sloppy
Did I just watch minutes of b-roll or three people drinking water from fancy glasses in the middle of the woods? Yes I did.
Congrats on your milestone 👏 🙌oh man the pork looked f****n AMAZING
Oh, yes, as a lefty I always have to be careful where I sit in restaurants. I've also kinda gotten into the habit of hunching over my food so my elbow doesn't stick out, probably makes me look like an animal.
Gunma-ken - happy JET memories from 1997-99 :)
It feels as if Chris's entire channel is just a massive ploy to get people into drinking sake.
I don't know why, but the "kampai......he he" at 9:43 is the funniest shit
The only reason I subscribed was for the Risotto content. I like Risotto.
dont be sipping your coffee right before Ryotaro says pork tactics
Congratulations!! Well deserved!
6:26 - and now I remember who Ivan Pavlov was...
Congratulations on an awesome milestone 👍😊👏
chris and risottaro were very drunk this episode.
10:34 "I feel like I'm in an opening cutscene for a video game."  Hey, you, you're finally awake.
I LOVE RYOTARO
I noticed this a lot, Ryotaro often goes with Chris and introduce him on very interesting sites. Mostly luxurious, some say, but a good amount of them are simple and enjoyable like those morning markets? Sweet shops chilling on the corners, warm beaches and onsens. Ryotaro is fairly knowledgable with these nice spots. But MOST often it involves food 😂, but let's be honest who can blame him? I'd dig for food AT ALL TIMES. Chris is lucky to have Ryotaro.
Because of these videos I started to “stomach too much”
Oooops-liked the video, forgot I'd liked it and unliked it, so I liked it again. I think I'd like to try the fizzy Sake and the porktactics, tho my husband usually eats the fatty bits for me
you should change the channels name to "Aboard in Japan"!
Chris would love to see you & Ryotaro go to a Super GT event or Super Formula event, Japanese motorsport is big there, you’ve done the drifting now try the track racing!
I really wanted that crunchy sardine! >_> But seriously researching some pork tactics in case we visit Gunma when I drag Kawolt back to Japan! <3
Damn, that tonkatsu looks amazing!!
Drunk Ryotaro getting excited and seeming amazed by everything is easily the most entertaining thing ever
Ryotaro just seems to be in constant presenter mode when he's on these videos
Does anyone know if it is also possible to eat completly vegan at a ryokan? Or do they don´t have that option in their menues?
Nice place you are staying well done to hitting the 2 million mark all the hard work has paid off it is good to have good friends in your life in Japan HUZZAH
Many congratulations on the big 2 million. Always entertaining and worth a watch. Here's to the next million.
U guys roast each other like goofy teens XD
drunk Ryotaro > normal Ryotaro
So much thin, dried out tonkatsu in the US. That looks so good! Thanks, as always Mr. Broad. Your channel is the gold standard.
That was drunk Ryotaro? Let him drink more.
congrats Chris with the 2M sub.
i love it when you introduce hidden gems
Hammered Ryotaro reviewing hotels is the show I never knew that I needed. Come Wine With Me or something. Make a jingle and some graphics with his annoying face.
Sardine: What is my purpose?  Me: You're a chopstick holder.
Aboard in japan Sounds like a good spinoff channel lmao
That Ryokan was actually only 250? Really? Please someone tell me! Do they have a website? It seems too good to be true. Thanks for the video Chris!
Its decided. All 2 million subscribers will come to japan to celebrate with you in the forest while getting drunk and enjoying pork tactics! Congratulations 🎊🎉 you deserve it !
If it weren't for the pandemic, I would love to try and stay at that inn
Now that I've watched stuff on Ryotaro's channel, their collab videos just seem hosted by Ryotaro in his style with snippets of Abroad in Japan footage.
I'd always love to try the food
Greetings from Bulgaria ,2mil of subs are 1/3 of my country so congratulations :)
Why ruin that water by changing it!
New goal acquired: Drink with Ryotaro.
I need to go to Japan 😎✌️
Congratulations on reaching 2 million subscribers! Watching you and Ryotaro eat food and get drunk is probably the best part of this video. It's a gift that just keeps on giving!
Great stuff
Good thing Connor didn't come. He'd appreciate drinking water directly from the river/stream, but he'd shit on the sake
the tonkatsu, Now i am going to have to make it this week.
Its Porktastic! These porktactics are great
Well I seem to recall I started watching your channel due to the exclusive places Ryotaro brings you to. Granted I stayed for the british humour.
ware the fuck is natski!!!!!
Congratulations Abroad in Japan.👊🥳✌ Chris and Ryotaro reminds of the cartoon characters Tom and Jerry. "Chris as Tom" and "Ryotaro as Jerry" the 2 best friends who brings Crazy Shenanigans to Abroad in Japan.👊🤩✌
the thumbnail
Drunk Ryotaro is the best thing to touch this planet.
The best part of this video was Risottoro. Then the sake next to the mountain stream.  And it should be 'Crisp Board', like a low market cheese board but with crisps instead.
Ryotaro is the man.
Ryotaro opens the door "WOAH, LOOKAHTTHAT!!!
god damn I love seeing Ryotaro on this channel
The tonkatsu was just pork-tastic!
I love the tonkatsu pork. Next on my cooking list!
Brighten my day man. 🙂
10:40 oh you're finally awake
Just two guys getting drunk in a nice hotel. It's simply beautiful
They are in Gunma... Eurobeat starts flowing through my veins!!
Not only is ryotatro a English accent thief he’s also a beef thief
Welcome to the black mesa research facility
Dave Board a Plank in Japan
Next idea : a snack made of pork, Pork TicTac.
Loved the video and the sukiyaki and sashimi looked delicous! Congratulations on 2 million, Chris!!! I've been watching for about 4 years now and enjoy your content especially since I haven't made it back to Japan myself yet.
(Slightly) drunk Ryotaro is the best Ryotaro.
The automatic kart is like an opening from half-life
Ryotaro's such a good friend. Congrats Chris!
damn, i rewatched your very 1st video and i was like, "man, this guy had no idea where he's heading with this..." lol.. Congratulations, Chris!
Ryotaro being slightly drunk is one of the funniest things I've ever seen.
we need more drunken Ryotaro... more fun, less smug.
Ryotaro makes me so happy, always have a good cackle when you guys are together 😂
Chris! Social distance your kanpais! 😂
Drunk Ryotaro is best Ryotaro!
I'm surprised Chris doesn't get drunk that easily especially with those loads of sake.
I swear man, everytime I see this guy he always drinks
Congratulations in reaching 2M subs Chris! Also, it's always fun to see Ryotaro in your videos.
Back at it again with Ristretto.
Chris, do you throw something at Risottoro when he snores?
first time knowing that 2160p even existed...
So what's some mythology background on the Tengu? I don't eat pork so I want chicken katsu. KOMPI!! 13:42  Emperor Riotoro: Kneel before me, PEASANT.
The Tonkatsu first!!
Drunk Ryotaro is the best.
Definitely trying the "pork tactics" if I ever get a chance to visit Gunma.
👺←tengu
Came for the window into a part of Japan that all the videos represent. Stayed for the pork tactics. :D
You two always dress like a Bond villains, backup replacements
Lost it when Chris was naming everyone but Ryotaro as team effort
I want the sake and the pork!🤤
Great video! Thanks :D
Hi Ryotaro!! Nice to see you around with Chris!!!
I love how Ryotaro expresses one simple thought with thousand words
OMG I can't stop laughing at tipsy Ryotaro 😂😂😂 what a legend.
It's always gonna be a good episode when Risottoro and Chris get together.
Subtitles: *ryotaro is slightly drunk" Ryotaro 2 seconds later: WOOOOOOAH
Ryotaro is right I only come here for him and natsuki 😂
👺
I like these "travel documentary-ish" videos
These videos are one of the few things holding me together during this pandemic. My boyfriend and I were planning a trip to Japan, but obviously put that on hold for now. We watch these videos together and use them for ideas for our trip. It give us something to talk about and look forward too. Thank you. 💜
"Who wouldn't want to get drunk in a forest?" - does this count as a mention of Finland? Should we celebrate (by geting drunk in a forest)?
Congrats on 2 million followers Chris! Longtime watcher/lurker here of both the channel and podcast.  The level of production quality you've been putting out is absolutely insane and is essentially indistinguishable from a conventionally-produced documentary, if with a bit more colorful/entertaining personalities involved.  I can imagine the amount of work and equipment involved has increased exponentially for you, but just know that there are a lot of us that greatly appreciate the wonderful cinematography.
Congrats Cris! ❤️
Watching this it took about 5 minutes for me to start drinking some Hakutsuru Nishiki
Chris played Half Life?
congrats, be well and keep creating good contents.
4:55  "sake berries"-Chris Broad
Cheers for the two million subscribers! That tonkatsu looked so thick, it definitely requires some advanced pork tactics to consume! If you guys are going south then you might want to visit Chichibu in Saitama - they do have a good brewing industry there as well, just to help Ryotaro maintain his buzz.
that's one thicc schnitzel!
Ryotoro eats his pork... tactically.
I wanna grab a drink with Ryotaro now.
You guys are adorable and so wholesome! I love how you mix you friendships in your channel and still keep it looking professional. Definitely a juggle, but you do it so well. Love you guys!
Another great video. Good work Mr Broad.
I really enjoy the vids with Ryotoro in them 🥰
Look - hands down the best thing about this video is watching you jokers get complete ****faced.    Hope the hangover wasn't too bad.   Congrats on the 2 million subs.
10:35 “hey you. You’re finally awake. You were trying to cross the border, weren’t you”
I want to experience it all, maybe not the raw egg with the sukiyaki 🤢 but that’s just me.
Great vid. love to visit these places soon. Especially the hotel. Ryotaro is like Chris' older brother
Congratulations on 2m subscribers 🥳 I’ve been a fan of your Chanel for years and it’s been great to see how you’ve improved 🙂
congrats on the 2m Chris :)
the fanciest drinking sequence I've ever seen. Only here on the Abroad in Japan channel 4:56
Ryotaro is like the ultimate tour guide for Japan. I wish I could experience such amazing places!
Chris is like the Gordon Ramsey of banter.
Chris + Ryotaro = I'm watching the video, no doubt.
Chris, do you work out? You look ... firm (15:20) ( I think that is the good word ). Aren't gyms closed in Japan now or can you do that in your apartment?
Argh! The Tonkatsu is so MOUTHWATERING! Putting it on the list! Congratulations on 2 million subs!
Ryotaro was twatted! LMAO! Congratulations Chris. I have loved sharing the journey with you for the last three years. Here's to the next million followers!
Love the dynamics between you and ryotaro, I think the best bit of the video for me was the start just being able to go to a river like that for nice clean clear spring water, imagine trying to do that in the uk?!? Would be bed ridden for weeks haha 😄
Alright, Risottoro's coat is pretty baller. Wish I had one like that.
Geez Ryotaro is drunk af !! hehehe
Grats on the 2mil Subs, I just got a 4k TV late last year, started watching your videos on it and they look amazing.
I thought Ryotaro said "Chris Board" for a sec, it made me go... what? 🤣
The G.O.A.T....Ryotoro of course!
Pork tictacs
Make-out tactics?
"Pork tactics" could be a good punk band name
These videos with Ryoatro and you are the only reason i watch your vids anymore
Feels like the real pork tactics is to sleep next to Ryotaro
8:11 "Different *cup* sizes" haha
I prefer BLOTTO RYOTARO.
drunk Ryotaro is a treat omg haha
13:48
Ryotaro's childish acts made this video 10 times better like every video he's on.
In Gunma and you didn't go mountain racing? What's wrong with you? the next time I better see a drifting AE86 m8.
Are these two boyfriends?
When Chris Broad introduced the world to Risottoro the earth literally shifted off its axis several degrees. It will never be the same again, and if you stop creating content together, maybe it will just stop spinning altogether. Please don’t.
Congratulations Dave in Japan for reaching 2 million subscribers!
Ryotaro drunk is life
Ryotaro is my favorite side character on the channel, I'm glad y'all were able to celebrate this milestone together
Happy 2 mil Abroad in Japan! Love that Natsuki, Ryotaro, Pete, Sharla, Aki, Joey, friends from Tokyo Creative are part of this as well <3
Haha love drunk exploring with Ryotaro xD
i need to brush up on my pork tactics the next time i eat tonkatsu
Forrest sake drinking dates with Ryotaro will probably become a sought after thing from this video alone!
Jotaro
Plot twist. 500 meters upstream, a bear takes a pee in the water...
I love the videos with Ryotoro and Chris. There’s a proper friendship akin to a proper British friendship - good friends but habitually awful to each other in public, but all in jest and all with love.
Ryotaro proving he is a true man of culture, even when drunk, with that Evita/“Don’t Cry For Me Argentina” moment 👏😄
How much did Chris need to hold himself back no to throw a "that's what she said" at 6:10 ? 😝😝😝
Good to see Chris is back to being a fat bastard :D
You guys figured out during lunch that you should be sitting on the other side of each other, and in the evening, you already forgot about it! I guess the sake was good! :)
my God ryotaro is so drunk
looking a bit tubby there
You two are even dressed similar to each other. How sweet lol
It took us all 2 million subscribers to realize we DO need more drunk Ryotaro in this channel.
Ryotaro's had so much screen time during the room tour it felt like I was watching ryotaros japan
Chris bored!!!!!🤣 Congrats man!!!👍
I remember years ago when your channel was on 150k subs. You've come a long way and your videos keep improving every time! All the best Chris!  全部でありがとうね、クリス君!
you know, ryotoro really feels like michael scott
Chris B O A R D
tsundere chris and chad ryotaro
The best thing i can imagine is to have this kind of a friend or a friend at all. Arrived in Switzerland 9 Years ago and still havnt got any real friends besides working colleagues.
Oh the "pork tactics" giggle... Love the video, giving me ideas where to go next time I'm in Japan! :)
Can't get over the quality of this video. Having had my exchange programs to Japan cancelled multiple times for over a year now, I find myself living vicariously trough your content. Amazing work as always! Hope to try out some of that juicy Tonkatsu (although I dunno about the pork tactics) whenever I'm able to travel!
You have to love at 1:22 randomly paused - Chris looks awkward and Ryotaro has a smile - even on a random pause he outdoes Chris hahah!
Can’t participate in pork tactics or drink alcohol, so my choice would be the sukiyaki and that breathtaking ryokan and the view for my next trip to Gunma...
Drunk Ryotaro is something else 😂
Reminds me of cocknose from Bo Selecta
Open cutscene of a video game? Probably because there was a cut scene just like that at the begging of a 007 game and we know Chris loves 007.
First Chris gets in a 1,000 year old log tub with Joey and now he's going to spend a drunken night sleeping with Ryotaro at a luxury inn? Chris has good tastes. ;)
Here I was thinking Gunma was famous for tofu shops and drifting
review japanese tabako and cigarets i want to drink sake and smoke when i come there
You’ve gotten quite the big face aroad   Also just subbed after watching a bunch of your videos
Congrats, Chris!  :)  I've been enjoying your videos for several years now and I'm sticking around for more!  Thanks for the laughs and info....I'm off to order that sake right now! ;)
every single time Im about to watch your new video I need to stock up some food on my desk. There is literally no way im watching anything without the urge to eat. Thanks for making me fat Chris
Congratulations on hitting the 2 million mark. What a great video to celebrate with. Sake in the forest: great idea unless you're the designated driver. Would love to try the warm sake for the tiny cups and the tonkatsu looked amazing. Thanks for cheering up another lockdown Monday here in Scotland. All the best.
The interaction between you guys is absolutely hilarious, please don't ever stop it hahaha.
I like Ryotaro better when he's slightly drunk.
I can now win at life with the pork tactics
Congrats on the 2mil, your content pretty much solidified my obsession with many things Japanese. Maybe one day, when my savings account hasn't been ravaged by a pandemic, I'll be able to visit. For now, I content myself with being well placed enough in the UK to eat occasional Japanese food & buy sake that isn't too overpriced.  Alas, this month was dry on sake, otherwise, I'd raise a tiny cup and salute you :)
And here I am, eating a lousy sandwich while watching them eat delicios food 😂
So Tonkatsu is a thicker, cheaper version of the classic Wiener Schnitzel just saying
The one bit I sing from a film I never watched
Congrats on your 2M subscribers, Chris! And thank you for another one of this video, I enjoy it very much. It would be great if you make a series out of it.
Risotorro went from not drinking to drinking all the time. Beginning to think it’s Chris that tortures HIM. lol
The best thing was a tipsy Risottoro :)
ah yes. Chris Freeman on his way to Sector C in the Black Mesa Research Facility.
Drunk Ryotaro is definitely the best part of the video lamo 😂
Ryotaros English is so good he's now developed innit
As a left-handed...can relate
we really need more drunk ryotarou in this channel
Ryotaro don't trust that sober, South Paw British guy!!! He is just out to steal the secret Pork Tactics.  as always a great joy to watch you to banter.
If this video proves anything, it's that we need more videos of drunk Ryotaro!
ONLY 2 MILLION ! , this is painfully low for this type of content. MUCH LUV <3
Between the champagne like sake, juicy thick tonkatsu, and that ryokan’s onsen bath.... Idk about going to Okinawa to see family (when it’s safe to)...might just Crisp Rod it up north instead. Absolutely amazing, from the video quality to choosing the perfect background music to shift the mood/transitioning, to the editing/cut style, all with pure, genuine love for the craft. An incredible time to be alive to see Japan in such a fun, and stunning way. Your 2mil+ subs are well earned man, thank you for all that you do! Also glad we can support you on Patreon too, all the little details that add to a whole video definitely don’t go unnoticed. Much Aloha! 🌺💚
man if I go to Gunma the thing I want to try is being in as good of a mood as Ryotaro is in this video. and the tonkotsu of course.
My young son caught a glimpse of the dinner scene and he is convinced that Ryuutaro  is your grandfather...
https://youtu.be/l3xy8LWv67s
What a view from that room
#2M cheers.
I’ve been watching the channel for years now but haven’t realized Chris is left handed until now!
My favourite duo 😂
I honestly think the best thing about this video was Chris
Lol, all the way he's progressed on the channel, i still remember his old videos in the first room, they're still good to watch even today! Lets head for 3 Million!
Give Ryotaro a few drinks and he turns from well spoken assassin to blabbering and singing Risottoro
Time for the new series "a board in Japan", where you film yourself carrying a washing board to all kinds of places.
Is like everything in Japan a 2h roadtrip from Tokyo
Impressive a 20min video even has 3-5 YouTube mid roll ads, it's almost good enough to be content these days 👌
the first part kinda reminds me of demon slayer lol
How long do you intend to stay in 🇯🇵, do you prefer it to the 🇬🇧?
You've been enjoying food lately. You have round face.
boil before drink.
Go to haruna mountain its akina mountain from initial d but in real life
Pork tactics reminds me somehow of Hogs of War
Hey Chris, congratulations on hitting two million subscribers!  And life goals! So many life goals in this video (though sleeping next to a snoring Ryotaro isn't one of them, I have to admit).
Chris is trying to do his classic sardonic banter but can't hide his smile :)
Would like to see Chris get Ryotaro level sloshed
Not going to ask how much for a night in such a place 🤑 😅
17:40 Weizen ╰(*°▽°*)╯ As a german I approve that
Ryotaro reminds me of that one friend in college who comes in just to bug me well i do kinda miss those moment. congrats Chris on 2mill
You have the funnest friends!
Love the fact whenever there is a Ryotaro vid its either hotsprings, food, hotel or all of the above. Mama ryotaro didn't raise no fools.
Please stay friends guys, you're both awesome!
Chris should be challenged to go on a trip and have no alcohol whatsoever. It would be fun to see him turn even more snarky
I'm glad Ryotaro got put in his place haha  I love him but I don't want him to get a big head lol
Is it safe to drink the water straight from the stream I’ve always been under the impression you should boil it first as they’re can be micro bacteria and parasites in it does anyone know ?
I watch videos only with Ryotaro on your channel so... You should be thankful to him.
Congratulations to 2m subscribers!!
How are you guys are not the hottest thing on Japanese TV I don’t know I just laughed so hard I’ll probably never visit Japan but I love the take on it you guy have.  It makes it seem so fun where is every other video I watch makes it seem like all you do is offend everyone by getting off the plane
Man. I always enjoy your videos. I've been watching for over 5 years now and I enjoyed every single video =)
Ryoto is so animated when tipsy, you need to give him drinks more often.
Congratulations on 2 million subscribers 🥳💖
Nothing beats the good old Rissottoro and Chris journey.
i want to try everything!
From one Chris to another, well done on 2Milly! 👍🏻
Oh mylanta, drunk Ryotaro is adorable 😂
yeah sign me up for that tonkatsu and the sake by the stream
Ryotaro looking straight suave in the first scene with that jacket.
I had to drop a like just for drunk Ryotaro.
hot spring!
matching clothes :)
Ryotaro should take a bit of liquor every time befoe shooting. A slightly drunk Ryotaro is a kawaii version of Ryotaro
9:11 Seeing you drinking the sake just reminds me how annoying it was my dad wouldn't let me try any while we were in Japan in 2012.  He said it was because he didn't want me to buy a large cup of it, on the chance I might not like it and thus would be wasting the rest of it.  No matter how many times I tried to explain that, yes, since I'm not too big on alcohol, there's a strong chance I wouldn't like it, but if it's a tiny cup like that, it hardly matters if I like it or not, since it's barely more than a sip anyway.  Besides that, I'm actually pretty sure I WOULD'VE enjoyed it, since it's not like regular alcohol
LEFTY GANG RISE UP!
I think I found the dream job for me - taking tourists into the forest to get them drunk by the cold water spring! 💦 🍶 🏔️
Interesting. I eat the edge of tonkatsu first, because it is the fattiest.
I liked the Japanese speaking bits in the vid, made the situations feel a lot more authentic. I think they should be incorporated a bit more often, and perhaps a bit more boldly, as they fit in perfectly well. No need to translate in speech afterwards either, the subs were a perfectly okay solution.  Congrats on the 2M!
Seems like the best kind of party I would love to join.  What a dream it would be the travel Japan and indulge in the food, drink, and culture with you guys.  Sincerely, a gentleman from Hawaii.
beautiful & interesting, congrats! thank you!
Congratulations on your 2 millions subscribers! Wishing you 2 million more! 🎆🍀🎉
Even though he tried to “kill” you, several times now over the years, both of you always end up at nicer places and unique activities. So congrats on 2 M subs  Chris ‘Bored’ and Ryotaro, we’d love to see more of you bantering over cool Japanese culture.
Congrats Chris! Watching your videos always makes me wants to go to Japan again, maybe for a few months to go to all the places you went in your videos. But then, there's COVID, and i'm a student, and i'm broke. T.T So, thanks to you, i got to experience Japan even if it's online
I feel like you can put the drunk disclaimer everytime Ryotaro appears and I would believe it.
Damn Chris, have u been working out? Cause you look pretty swole in this vid
make a skating channel and call it a board in japan
CONGRATS TO THE 2 Million!!! I love your channel and enjoy every video. The music, the style of production, everything is top notch and has become a part of my life. The podcast too, which accompanies me on my trips to work. Btw.: Funny to see japanese Weizen-Bier - have to try that on my next trip! Best from germany!
Congrats on 2 million! Need a video with everyone in it that has been a big part of the Abroad in Japan experience
I'm sorry to hear that your videos with Ryotaro get less views... they are actually my favourite. I like how personable Ryotaro is, and the wacky adventures he brings you on are always fun.
Come for the natsuki, stay for the ryotoro
10:34 "Hey, you. You're finally awake. You were trying to cross the border right? "
I swear, if I ever win the lottery and will be able to afford to travel to Japan, I'll catch Ryotaro and bring him to a night out. He looks like an excelent drinking partner. No offense Chris! (^_-)
What's the first video that featured Ryotaro?
Nice 4k
I watch the most videos for the food. It's just great!
You guys should have talked more about the beer you drink in the final shot. It's so rare to find "Weizen" in Japan!
Great content as always
Bruh, Ryotaro is awesome 😂😂
Is Ryotaro a serial killer?
I love Ryotaro man lol. Your guys chemistry is great.
Oh Ryotaro, you look so fancy and Chris, Um well, ok..good show. Lmao. Haha just Joshin and givin you shite 😂I do love Japanese men, sorry Chris. Although, I do love your content 😍❤️.
Congrats on reaching 2 million subs! 👍
Isn't Ryotaro the best food you had because he's a meal foryour eyes, Chris? *WINK WINK*
Congratulations on over million subscribers Chris Broad!!
Pork tactics sounds like a killer 90's cooking anime.
No more this Ryotaro guy please .. wheres natsukiiiiiiii!!!
I just realized Chris is left-handed. How have I never noticed it before?
Chris, thank you for my first truly interactive Youtube experience. Imagine my surprise when sitting in my stinking hot living room in Brisbane Australia,  that you flash up a shot of the Junmai Sake, and I go "hang on, I know that label" and promptly fetch a bottle of Junmai Sake Ippin from the bottom of the sock drawer. I feel like part of the experience, I feel like someone has rearranged the keyboard, I feel like I'd like to say more but, drinking and typing is proving diccifult. CHeeRs!!!!!
The room is so gorgeous... I’m so envious
getting you drunk in the forest surely is one of Ryotaro's way to backstab while you weren't looking but unfortunately, he's tipsy too
The pork-tactics were pork-tastic! *Wonders why Chris Board is so mean to Risottoro* *Flashes back to all the times Risottoro tried to kill Chris* Oh yeah...
Wow seriously churning out those videos. Keep it up Chris!!!
Followed this channel for yonks Chris, and as the better half will attest, dry sarcasm rules king...we know you  can hold a convo in Japanese...flex it..i would love to hear you chat with tenders normally.
Please please please please show Ryotaro some LOVE already, dude!  We love this wonderful man.
Great video
The wooden hand carved boards are pretty good 👍
👍👍👍
The Ryokan I stayed at in Gero once felt like a custom Counterstrike map in that the layout seemed to make absolutely no sense at all. What is it with these places and being like video games?
5:40 i’m honestly blown away bybthe fact that they have a panko drawer to bread the pork in quicker 🤯
you can't get this quality on TV.
Great video. Congratulations on your achievement, best wishes and blessings for a happy and prosperous year to come 😉
Cris is not kind to ryotoro!
I came for this dynamic 💕
Ryotaro is SOO FUNNY!!  HAHAHAHAHA  get him typsy any day!  It is good you have a such a great friendship together!  The tontasku and sake tasting was fantastic!  The hotel IS MASSIVE
I can't believe you already hit 2 million subscribers <3 <3 I have been following this channel for years , and I have never got disappointed from a video , Congratulations and I hope this channel continue for ever , it's really one of the things that makes me glad I am alive.
Chris Board
Congrats 2M subs! Give me that Champagne! 4:24
Sake is wonderful! I wonder if I can get them in the US.
I remember the last time you were asked to taste water 😭😂🤣
ryotaro is the best co-host, love watching you guys get drunk
15:10 me: _laughs in German_  but now I wonder where exactly Ryotaro worked here..... so I can avoid that place of course
I would like to try all the alcohol in Japan if possible. I do found a few in convenience store that's like a mixture between a soda or juice with beer about 3% alcohol rating. I didn't know it's an alcohol until my friend pointed it out. I just thought I grab a soda in convenience to quench my thirst.
Ryotaro brings life to the channel
Ryotaro is an absolute legend lmfao
I'm actually not that big a fan of Rossotero.
Drunk Risittoro is best Risottoro
omg i loved that video soo much! You two are a perfect duo and it's just hilarious to watch, i was smiling the entire time. Your cinematic-skills are still keep improving although they`ve been on an incredible niveau before!  Thank you so much for the great content and much love from germay <3
Congratulations!
IDK why... But whenever I watch this guy's videos, I feel like I'm there with him. when you lay down in bed and watch these videos, you enter absolute peace.
Congrats on 2 million subs, Chris! What was the name of sake you've had with your dinner, the one with rabbit and a crescent (can be seen at 14:56)? Is it available in Japan only?
Somehow japan is the only country I would want to try drinking spring water from
Love the eps with Ryotaro and Natuski
I'm so jelly.  Ryotaro finds new gimmick and does all of his videos drunk, er I mean buzzed.
Hmm , so essentially , when drunk, Ryotaro becomes Natsuki
I love Sharla but she is definitely lacking in the Pork Tactics department.
I love the rice wine the most
Chris board well looks like you been promoted from chris broad to chris board congrats.
6:10, that's what she said
Everytime Chris uploads a new video, my day is made.
I thoroughly enjoyed the Ryokan in Japan truly like nothing in the west.
Oi! Quite reckless to let Risottoro drive that cart in that state of drunkenness!
This is the funniest video in a while. You should get drunk more often, and then record it again.
"Ryotaro and I got drunk again! Here's the video."
You had me at Sake !  That is the T Bone steak of Tonkatsu ! Flintstones Brontosaurus ribs style !
LOL  Kick ass . Great video this is why i watch this channel  . Every once in a while they come out with real gems  .   ps . Pork tactics
Does anybody know the title of the soundtrack at 2:30 ?????
Chris broad was spot on for saying an opening cutscene from a video game  Hey, you! you're finally awake.  (missed opportunity)
I was afraid of watching it in 2160 4k (because i have a bad internet and a bad graph card) but damn man i felt i was in here it was a great video
Next Stop: 5 Million! If you enjoy Japanese culture, this is the place to be.
Ryotaro is the good kind of childlike when he is drunk its funny ^ ^
SAAAAAAKEEEEE!?!? Da sake ich nicht nein! 🤪
Chris Board: Pork Tactics  Sounds like a video one may only find in the back of the video store, on an old VHS.
As Natsuki would say: Justice delicious!
Hey Chris!!! Great video!! I am longtime fan, I have  enjoyed watching all your  videos. I lived in Gunma in the 90s....Seems like we have many similar experiences- I taught English a few years, I rode by bicycle across Japan (Isesaki to Kobe), burned out on teaching and wanted to do something else....got drunk in forest.  I am also のんべえ！！  I think its really cool you focus on small towns and countryside, glad you are finally focusing on Gunma!! So many weird and interesting places in Gunma and Tochigi, I   wish I still lived there so I could show you around. Keep up the great work!
Ryotaro once again was trying to assassinate Chris, by making him drink copious amounts of Alcohol. Genius move Ryotaro.
Congrats Chris!!! And sorry Ryotaro but I subscribed yrs ago for your sarcasm Chris keep.up with the great videos!!
You keep going through Gunma but you keep missing the town where I live, and it’s an awesome place! For Escape to Mount Fuji you like went right around it, and now you stay near Maebashi! I’m sad :(
I know Ryotaro keeps trying to kill you every other episode, but I sometimes just feel bad for him with the amount of roasting you do of him
Chrisand a tengu Ryotaro what could be worst well maybe seeing a tengu close up i mean with how long there noses are you are bound to lose a eye or worst.
Wow 2m sub... Congrats abrod in japan
That jump followed by don’t cry for me Argentina... 👀😂👌🏻
Square Enix Presents "Pork Tactics"
I totally understand the glass changing the drink, I drink Soju almost exclusively these days but if I don't have my soju glass I avoid it.
Can make video about winter camping in must coldest in japan
I literally have to skip the Tonkatsu part as I suddenly, badly craved for one but nowhere near to buy some. Damn.
I like these smartass videos much better than the serious ones. There's a spectacular shabu shabu restaurant in Maebashi and you weren't far from the tomato ramen in Numata.
Excellent video as always, however, I can't say that drinking unfiltered water from a mountain stream was a good idea. You never know what has been happening upstream.
You deserve it :)
Sake in the forest by the creek!!!!!
Ryotaro IS the view
fairly sure that Ryotaro wasnt the only one slightly drunk ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
sipping sake by the water ...indeed he won at life lol
this is beautifully shot~!
Can someone explain Ryotaro’s dialect/accent??? Part British part I don’t know part east asian. I think we need a Ryotaro background story video.  Great video btw.
can't spell "Ryotaro" without "Yo", and that's pretty neat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7oo2XgaSU8
(What is the sake with the moon on it?)
Who made up the beds, Birubo Bagginsu or Furodo Bagginsu? :D
I thought I was watching Fake Taxi there for a second...
We'Re  StAyInG  aT  tHe LoTuS  iNnnnnn
congratulations!!!!
I would love to tour all these wonderful sake breweries.
I tough thats was Enma inn 🤣
The pork tactics were good! 🤣 I think watching this all being a vegetarian is funny still I won't it any of this, but the time spent is so funny and heart warming
I'm just here for the pork tactics.
I'm here for Ryotaro
@7:12 It could have been worse Chris. It could have been Pork Tic Tacs.
Oh god, that katsudon... when travel restrictions are lifted, the first thing I'm gonna do is buy a ticket to Japan and stuff myself with pork until I can't move.
As a Polish girl, I see tonkatsu and it's like poche version of schabowy.
I wonder what's the best Plum Wine you get in Japan?
Chris and Ryotaro are the best comedic duo
The production value on Chris' videos has been increasing noticeably, especially as of lately. Love it.
Have you made any videos in Beppu? I might move there for grad school!
did Ryotaro and Chris wore a couple Short in 15.54?
👺
They're such a great couple 👬🥰
Drunk Ryotaro is best Ryotaro xD
Chris: This is like a video game Risottaro, Emperor of Taxies: Hey, you. You're finally awake.
Isn't Ryotaro drunk most of the time?
Congrats! Well-earned no doubt. The videos have only been improving
Initial D!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The worst part about being left handed is writing and getting graphite all over your hand.
Love drunk Ryotoro
A Board in Japan
Can I suggest cage diving with Chris and Ryotaro?
you truly a good friend when you insult each other but none get offended
That pork looks like it has "shake n bake" on it. Even your description of it sounds like shake n bake, lol. I'm wondering who came up with it first?
Cheers
Everything's better when done in a snowy forest XD. Great video Chris!!
"awkward" Whehe..
Mate you are so lucky to share your journey with good friends. One of life's rich experience's. Cheers HH Australia
Love u guys!! For another 2 Mil!!!!!
One of your funniest videos
Congratulations!
How can you guys get drunk with water (the sake)? Almost look like two tengus xD
Chris Board Bored in Japan
EMPEROR
Drinking water straight from a stream is how you get dysentery, *Dave*
Ryotaro getting tipsy was probably the best part of the video 😂 Jokes aside, this video was packed with amazing things to do in Gunma, the sake breweries, don katsu restaurant and the ryokan all look amazing. Thank you guys showing us Chris!
Was the tonkatsu "Justice Delicious"????
Another leftie?! Amazing.
All these years, and I never realised that Chris is cack-handed...
that pork cutlet was fucking sexy, thanks Chris!
ぐぐぐぐぐぐぐぐぐぐ
Love the dynamic of these two. They are hilarious
I wonder if tengu is popular among women for a whole different reason
Lefties unite!
This video's title should be 'Ryotaro's slightly drunk shenanigans...and then getting drunk some more' LOL. Love the video and Congratulations Chris on crossing 2 million subs. Hope you reach 3 million soon and much more. Keep it up 👍🏼
Ryatoro the taxi driver. Oh god, we're all doomed.
I'm excited for the upcoming sequel to Icha Icha Tactics the famous Pork Tactics!
0:18 UsoppxRyotaro
Loving this long ride of your videos. Loving you getting up to 2m. Can't wait to see you at 4m! Keep up the superb work! Yatta!
Cheers Chris!!!, So happy for you, been watching you since initial japanese learning videos!!!
the best thing is when ryotaro being drunk..
Two Abroad in Japan vids in one week?! It must be my birthday
The best thing from today was easily slightly drunk Ryotaro
Definitely would want to try that inn right there.. and those tonkatsu looks delicious and juicy
*Congratulations Chris on the 2 Million Subscribers! what a milestone! looking forward to many more adventures in Japan! More micro-documentaries!* just wish you didnt bash Ryotaro so much haha
ryotaro is lookin pretty sexy in this video 🥴🥵
Congrats on 2 million!!
Other Japanese master: I've dedicated my whole life to improve my skills and find the best ingredient for this food. Nagai-san: Drink this water. It's the best. Drink this sake. I'm proud of it. (Drink like filming ad with ryotaro)
Ryotaro is honestly really slept on. He reminds me of my grandpa.
First off, I saved this video to my Japan folder on YouTube. Second, this was a really great video with some really great tings to do in this area. Gotta say it was fun to see a drunk Ryotaro. LOL.
:)
This was a fantastic episode
Great now I have to order some low quality tonkatsu to satisfy my craving.
250 for a room this big with all its features, is a freaking steal, hotels in my country goes for 400-500 for a decent hotel.
How many beers since you've started the channel? :D
congrats on 2mil Abroad :)
I like the sarcastic rivalry but sometimes it feels like Chris overdoes the fake Ryotaro hate
I would visit for the Pork, that dish looked damn delicious and if I could ever find a more appealing plate of breaded pork I'd eat that daily.
Chris, i like you but if you want to be a TV presenter then please start looking after yourself.
Tonkatsu is my favorite, followed by saki.  Great to see how the brewer shows off the water his sake is based from. And Reataro, your handsome gob is why we all impatienty wait for the next episode (not).
CONGRATULATIONS. 💙
These videos always make me hungry. Going to get tonkatsu tomorrow if I can find it.
Hey Chris, Not one for commenting on video but I wanted to congratulate you on 2 mil subscribers.  You put out great content and as someone who makes video for a living myself I see how much work is put into them. Keep it up man!
Ryotaro is the man.
It's really funny to me how Chris, the British guy, is really kind and respectful at all these places he goes to, tries to show people these hidden gems throughout Japan, always points out the best things, etc, meanwhile Ryotaro, the Japanese guy, is just plain brutal lol. Really switched the stereotypes up there. Joking aside, Chris and Ryotaro seem like great friends. Love these videos. Congrats on the 2 million, you deserve it :)
What happened to natsumi , he is nowhere to be seen in ur videos nowadays
Ryotaro feeling himself after that warm sake. I love it.
I will almost definitely replicate your whole trip from this video the next time I can travel!
The tonkatsu and the fresh water
I like drunk ryotaro 😁
The sake drinking by the stream was my favorite
beautiful!!!
Ryotaro reminds me of the blue wiggle.
7:00 If you just swapped seatings, you both would've got extra arm space
Congrats on 2 million subs! I love the way the channel has developed over the years.
Hi! Good day   I watched your videos since start of lockdown but just subscribed today :D I'm from the Philippines and your videos made me want to go to Japan when COVID lockdowns are less.  My question is when we land in Tokyo airport, where do we buy clothes for Japanese season, especially when its winter?     Philippines is a tropical country and its seldom they sell winter clothes here.
Sardine: "What is my purpose?" Japanese deity: "After you're dead you serve as a Hashioki." Sardine: "😔😢"
This is a beautiful man love. 💕
The onsen, the tonkatsu, the sake!  Thanks for sharing the trip to Gunma and congrats
wow. I have been watching for years, the quality of this video is beautiful
I've never heard or seen a 'slightly drunk' Ryotoro. And he's hilarious
It’s amazing how Mother Nature provides when humans aren’t killing her
Congrats!
Alternate title for this episode, 飲み放題
Straw roof last 30 to 40 years... Western 3 tab asphalt shingles last 7 to 12 and architectural shingles last 20 to 25...   hmmm
I feel like Ryotero is Chris’s rich sugar daddy in some of these videos. They make a good couple
Congrats Chris
Small thing but I like that you used a little Japanese in the video. I know you tend to avoid it, but it was nice to see you have some nice interactions with the man at the brewery in his native language.
This dude really be Chris BFF 😂
I've been a fan of Chris 'Broad' for the past 3 years. After seeing this video commemorating his 2 millionth subscriber (Congrats!) I just had to venture back in time and see the very first Abroad in Japan video. It's pretty good, not too.... cringey. Not at all.  Sure it has creepy lighting, sketchy audio, and occasional jerky video, but it also has the melancholy of a brooding poet tempered by  sudden moments of longing or sadness. And of course, Jesus sandals.   😃🎆🎇🎆🎇✨✨✨🎉
make another cycle in japan series!!!
I’m super happy that you got 2million subs. You definitely deserve it
Ryotaro may be a good co-host, but natsuki is just the goat
👺👺
This channel keeps me sane during quarantine.
Wow Ryotaros English is getting so much better!! great job!! ^_^ yayy. also awesome video!!
i love their friendship lol
loving your video... and then i got 3 ads within 60 seconds. not cool.
Good for you! Great channel and the quality is just awesome,  the only thing I'll say is that sometimes it sounds like you're making fun of his english, although that's just my personal opinion, but yeah that food looked amazing and the 4k is really crisp
The love/ hate relationship of these guys always puts a smile on my face. They're like two brothers always bickering but end up laughing in the end
love the tempo of your video
Porktastic!
A legend returns with Chris Broad in this video.....and yes it's Ryotaro XD
As someone who is also left-handed, I can relate to the whole bumping arms with those of right-handed peers while dining together.
Pork tactics + Ryotaro slightly drunk + a sardine as a hashioki = best video of 2021 so far XD
Five Nights At Ryotaros.... Incoming!
Risottoro a bit drunk innit?
Content idea: scuba diving in Japan? There is a place to dive with hammer head sharks
Resident Evil/BioHazard.... First 7 seconds!
I’m going to be honest, Ryotaro and Chris are legitimately the best duo on YouTube. I would say Natsuki and Chris but let’s be real when natsuki is in the video, it just becomes a natsuki video not Chris video haha, he steals the whole show!
I know you’re just joking around and it’s all in good fun, but man, what did Ryotaro ever do to you?
I love your shows and believe it or not, that handsome/sexy Ryotaro adds a Great Value to your production. 👍
You are spoiling us with all these releases, and I would not have it any other way ^_^
I need more drunk Ryotaro in my life. Please. I am travelling and eating and drinking vicariously through you right now and I NEED IT 0_0
Does everyone have a "balcony song" they're tempted to sing when they approach a balcony? Mine is the aria from Final Fantasy 6.
Chris Board/Bored(?) joins Aboard in Japan with Chris England and Dave.
I love these videos with Chris and Ryotaro, the chemistry is good.
Congrats Chris! <3
Chris should get Ryotaro drunk for videos more often!!!
Chris Clarkson and Ryotaro Hammond :)
I certainly enjoy watching Aboard in Japan.
They look like a somewhat disfunctional couple...
Tsunenori Abe's voice is so sexy, I could listen to it all day
I love seeing the ryokan!
I really love your content!!! I have no means to support on Patreon yet so I don't skip ads no matter how long, hope it helps a bit. Will continue to support, Chris!!
#porktactics
Been watching this channel for 7 years, and only just now noticed that Chris is left handed! xD
What happens when someone randomly pees up stream? 😳 sorry
#askabroad How do you go about asking if you can film in a ryokan/ restaurant in Japan? Do you call ahead or just ask when you get there? Thanks! :)
I'm living in Japan for 2-3 more years and I hope can find a friend like Ryotaro! He is quite the character and great friend!
Did you shoot this on the Sony a7s3? Hella sharp.
Rydrunkaro is delightful
Drunk Ryotaro is another level of energy...
I don't think I've seen Ryotaro so sloshed. They need to do this more often.
Ryotaro was so cute this episode, his energy was infectious!
Can we just take a moment to appreciate how CINEMATIC Ryotaro opening the Shoji was?? 11:30
Don't want to use "cute", so use "kawaii" instead.
The Sake
Ryotaro is hilarious in this video
Congratulations on 2M subscribers. I remember watching possibly since the Driving in Japan video when your channel name was "Abroadin" (one word) Japan.
Normally, I'd say "Whatever Ryotaro was on, I want some," but I know what he was on, and it was sake, and I want some.
Do a video on music in Japan
Love drunk Ryotaro lol
I hate my mind when I see that mask.
Are you guys dating?
Congratulations!!
I feel blessed for a early upload
I would love to hang out with you guys in Japan! No matter the place it would still be a great time! Not gonna lie though, that tub looked very nice!
Snoring is a side effect of the "pork tactics"
lol Silly boys... Congratulations
Any ill effects after drinking from the stream?
the best thing for me was watching you two being best friends <3 haha Second best thing, the hotel room and the pork
Yeah .......... I'm fine with calling Ryotaro an Emperor as long as he sings that song every time he's near a balcony.
Hanadaka - Tengu, if anyone is curious. One of two species of Tengu. The other being Karasu.
“Pork tactics” Does sound... Acward!
8:50 48 degrees Celsius is 118.4 degrees Fahrenheit. (48°C × 9/5) + 32 = 118.4°F
Your videos are always fun to watch, Ryotaro. 😊
Drunk risottaro is amazing
Congratulations Chris! You put out amazing content and deserve the success
I just ate and I'm already hungry again watching this
Great video!  I’d love to know what all was included in the $250 out of this adventure.
Anyone find it weird that Chris will tell us how much things cost in dollars instead of euros?
Still waiting for Journey Across Japan 2: Skateboard Boogaloo
My day was boring until I saw a new Abroad in Japan video has been uploaded. Day fulfilled.
I liked the inn best.  And Ryotaro is a cutie.
Where's Natsuki? we miss him dearly Chris
You were pretty hammered as well, don’t blame it all on risotoro! Hahahaha
Congrats for the 2 mil, Chris Board, Indiana Jones of Japan.
3:04 Whenever I see people drinking from apparently clean natural streams, I am reminded of a friend who was rock climbing in the Rocky Mountains in Colorado, decades ago, and he drank from a crystal clear stream. Unbeknownst to him, further up the mountain, some beavers were living and crapping in the stream. My friend developed a cripplingly horrendous case of giardia, a microscopic parasite that causes a malady similar to amoebic dysentery. My poor friend was deathly ill, puking and crapping his life away on the toiled for two weeks with nightmare diarrhea. No joke! The giardia microbes are large enough to be filtered with the cheapest water filter, so the moral of the story is to filter your water in the wild before drinking it. Giardia: What You Should Know https://youtu.be/jlvXtvWm80A
I’m not even big into sake, but this moment right here 5:09 is #lifegoals.
Ryota drunk is the best thing in this video. " Pork tactics" comes at a close 2nd..  Congrats on 2m subs! 👏👏👏👏
Are you allowed to modify your meal in Japan, or is it one of those countries where it's a no go? For example could I order a dish and then request no [whatever ingredient I don't want]? Or does it depend on the restaurant?
I see Risottoro in a peacoat, I hit the like button.
now im hungry and want to eat tonkatsu..
Need more drunk Ryotaro! Also, Board in Japan does sounds like a legit Youtube channel. Maybe your 3rd Channel's name?
That guy really drank the water there, where upstream, animals and fish shit and piss in it
Watching the podcast hearing about how ryotoro will get absolutely smashed after one cup makes this episode much better to watch ahahahahah
The love of my life lives in Gunma <3
Drunk Ryotaro is best Ryotaro!!
its gotta be the pork tactics and chris bored
Your face is getting rounder and rounder.
Homies gonna end up with a parasite drinking water like that lol
Don’t make me choose! It all looked amazing!!!
1.5 Million Risottaro fans can't be wrong!
no way he seriously just took the glass inot the rivier and drank it...damn..i like that...can't do that here in the USA...
Urokodaki
I want to try all of the things you and Risottoro tried in the video. Especially the sake-by-the-river tasting. That looked amazing!
i almost thought it was ryotaro's channel i had to double check the channel name HAHAH
someone at nestle is trying to figure out where that spring is...
Hi Chris! How much was it for a night at the inn you stayed in? Did you stay in the four person max room? Trying to look at the prices online for later dates but the info doesn’t come up.
Normal Ryotaro: *cool, British accent* Drunk Ryotato: Oh Bathroom!!
I happen to love Ryotaro no homo
a board in Japan
If I was old enough I would try to drink the water at the spring
Congratulations Chris on reaching 2m subs.
I like the inn, i like the sake, the pork. All that. But i love the banter and friendship between you two the most. Cheers.
Please don't overwork and take some time to rest. There's always the risk of karoshi by eating and drinking good stuff at amazing places.
Ryotaro is right, he's always in the videos where Chris visits the most luxurious places. It's like Ryotaro is some kind of sugar daddy.
To be fair, I don't think I've ever heard you pronounce Ryotaro's name correctly, (I somehow doubt his name is actually りょったろ) so he can call you Chris Board if he wants to :P
Yay for Ryotaro!
Hey Chris and Ryotaro Congrats! Great vid. Loved the tonkatsu tactics and the saki by the creek. You always are fun to watch and give great ideas of places to go in Japan.
It's just slightly drunk and what happen when he really drunk
That pause after "DONT CRY FOR ME ARGENTINA THE TRUTH IS *silence*" had me cackling
Chris Board - the latest Danboard figure theme
Haha, "pork tactics," porktacular!
Never took Ryotoro for an Evita fan! Good man!
The drinks are never ending! But congrats Chris. You've been working hard. Keep it up
Why are Ryotoro videos the least watched. My favorite videos have Ryotoro. Who coincidentally went to the same highschool as me.
You two have a distinctly sartorial look in this video. Ryotaro with the double-breasted camel coat and Chris with the clean, monochromatic navy ensemble. I dig it haha
All the supporting characters in this anime are so good, more Ryotaro plz
Thicc tonkatsu.
Congratulations Abroad in Japan. You deserve every subscription you have and get in the future. Your videos bring joy to my life and I thank you. Cheers from Canada!
I just realized that the reason this channel is called AbroadinJapan is cause his name is Chris Broad......... XD
I’m glad that Gaijin from Ryotaro’s Japan now has his own spin-off channel. Obviously Ryotaro-sama inspired him to create his channel!
Definitely the Tonkatsu!
Ok, it was a bad idea to play this at the AA meeting tonight.
I definitely want to visit Japan 🇯🇵 one day absolutely a beautiful country and people and culture
Needed more Initial D.
a board in a pan
Ryotaro is the best!
Ryotaro: 1.5 million was because of me Me: I thought a chunk was cause of Natsuki 😂😂😂
Ryotoro sings like a true despot!
ryotaro opening the shoji doors at 11:30 is really video game like lmao
10:33 "Hey you, you're finally awake. You were trying to cross the border? Walked right into that Tonkatsu ambush, like us and that Riosotto over there."
another AMAZING quality video chris !!!      &    Drunk Rissottoro is something else. . . .
Chris thank you for the videos always!
The sexual tension between these two is incredible 🤣
It's really amazing that over 2 million people actually like watching these videos besides me!
Congrats to Risottoro for getting Chris Boards channel to 2 million subs!  Oh and I would most definitely try the sake if I came to Gunma.
pork barrel tactics? hehehe
congrats on 2m and great vid as always!! your dynamic with ryotaro is so entertaining and you always pick such interesting and cool places and people to showcase
Did Chris announce his pregnancy?   I must have missed it.  😂😂😂😂  Chris needs to take us on a tour of traditional Japanese gym.  LOL
This looks like so much fun! It will be nice when we can travel like we did before Covid.
I really wanna try that tonkatsu
Ryotaro is so hot right now, Ryotaro (I can’t help but simp I’m sorry)
Congratulations on the 2M subs Chris! I really am happy as this has been so well deserved. Always looking forward to your content. It's filmed brilliantly, the topics are fun, sometimes I learn things (which I'm obsessed with), I get a genuine laugh from it, the music accompaniment is spot on and I really, genuinely enjoy this. Sorry it's a sappy comment but I'm really happy to see this! Congratulations again!
Drunk Japanese, seems like a fun time
Ryotaro is awesome
Drunk Ryotaro looks fun
Chris Board from Board in Japan LMAO
Like or Show Some Love, If You Are Part of the 1.5Million That Subscribed Because of Ryotaro
Aloha! Congratulations! Please stay safe! Aloha to Ryotaro as well! Take care!
10:33 half-life
I will never be able to go to Japan and experience the things you experience. Thank you for a taste of the good life
10:31 Half-Life:Chris
I was going to skip this video but then I saw Ryotaro in the thumbnail.
"Congrats on the 2M subscribers!" she says, fully expecting her comment to be buried and not read by Chris or Ryotaro.
Your insights are priceless for travellers thinking of a trip to Japan
Oh, I took Gunma off my ‘visit’ list, now I’m not sure why! I’ll check some of this stuff out if I get the time now!
I would try a lot if saki
love all your travel videos, keep it up please!!!
I want more drunken Ryotaro narration.
It well may be the best spring water but what about animals that live and drink water from that spring 🤔?
LOL, I'd love to share sake with you both...you are both hysterical!
Drunk Ryotaro.   Instant like.   More drunk Ryotaro.
As subscriber I conform that I only subscribed to see Ryotaro annoy Chris in every single video, congratulations for the 2M BOTH OF YOU
ryotoro looks better with the mask on
did you say Tom Cat Pork?
best  ryotaro video because he is drunk
A board in Japan, creating guides to all of the wooden planks across Japan
I hope Ryotaro forces himself into a permanent co host position!
Consistently one of the best content on YT. No debate
That chef beat that pork, the same way CDawgVA beats his meat
Congrats on 2 million! Love your channel to bits!
sake and tonkatsu!!
Congrats!
What a nice cute couple. 👬
10:33 Half-Life?
been watching since the walkers cheese and onion crisps video, congrats, i love the channel more than ever
Ryotaro is such an awesome human haha
Chris, have you negatively lost weight?
Living a Japanese dream...don’t overdo it Chris...
13:13 As an Argentinian it's a such an honor having Drunk Ryotaro singing Evita n.n
Thanks Ryotaro for helping  Chris  to reach  2 million subscribers 😄😄😄
Congrats on 2 million subs! Well deserved 🍾🥂👏🏻
Our Japan trip was delayed due to the pandemic....☹
Nice seeing a drunk reotoro
We gotta get Ryotaro and Natsuki together and get them right pissed up and watch the all the fun.
Happy two million!
Drunk Ryotaro is the energy I need in my life.  Yo Ryo, if you ever decide to move to Australia (as if) let me know and we can get drunk every weekend. 😂
Dave in Japan Abroad in a Pan Chris BOARD
This channel has become so good ... Chris just keeps raising his standards and increasing the amount of work he puts into the videos. Really they are an absolute jewel of YouTube. Thanks for constantly putting out such great content for those of us who love Japan!
I love living in Dorset. Because I can literally buy drinks and then walk to woods or  copses and get drunk!!! Amazing
"i'm not gonna give you anymore beef"
I forget what it's called, but there's a weird thing in English where certain sounds have to go in a certain order for them to feel right. The order is "i" - "a" - "o". Example: "Big Bad Wolf" or "Tic Tac Toe" . The word "tactic" seems to break this already, so making it "pork tactics" (o-i-a) is all backwards and our English speaking minds just don't like it.
We need a ryoutaru movie
We need more of Drunk Ryotaro
Somebody get ryotaro some water.
Pretty sure Ryotoro is a undercover tourism agent who was paired with the channel to use tourism budget to sponsor Chris’s trips
ryoutaro-san is more like a shogun then emperor
My boyfriend wants to know where Ryotaro gets his clothes from.
Where the fuck is Natsuki. Congrats Chris.
YOU'RE A LEFTY LIKE MEE
Will Risotto ever hit the all the notes for Don’t Cry For Me Argentina? Seriously, pretty well sung!
We don't deserve drunk Ryotaro! 😍
Aboard in Japan, now exclusively about cruise ships
He didn't say it but Chris thought they looked like giant c*cks....  Everyone knows what I'm talking about...       LOOOOOL or you could call them d*ckheads
I love the drunk version of  Ryotaro! ~(￣▽￣)~*
Best video to watch drunk, haha. Look forward to heading to Gunma when I eventually head to Japan. Will have to go to Tokyo and Kyoto, of course, but this looks beautiful and I'm a filthy drunkard so it's an easy third destination.
Ah, so Risottoro is THAT type of drunk. The line between fun, obnoxious, to belligerent, is thin.
Ryotaro is a true world treasure.
How does he eat so much yet stay fit? If I had his job I’d be 300 lbs!
The best part of this video would have been to see you falling into the beck on a snow covered, forested hillside.
I may be in minority, but I so much more enjoy videos with Ryotaro than with Natsuki. Hope this year Chris and Ryotaro will have more videos together.
13:47 ryotaro: call me an emperor chris : kill me
Nice 👍
This background music is banging!
i like how chris made subtitle and subsequently explain what they talked about in japanese🤣😅
10:34 1/2 life reference ?
Congrats on the 2 million subs Chris! Here's to the next 2! it's so hard to believe that you started you channel filming a video of yourself in a chair and then having issues in making up a Futon! I've loved every minute of watching this channel, It's been one hell of a roller coaster ride just as much for us as you and I can't wait to see where Abroad In Japan will take us next!  It's been like a magic! Cheers! (^V^)
Ryotaro was so funny.
new channel: Chris Bored in Japan  Chris travels to various destinations across Japan and does nothing else but sit and look very bored
I've learned a lot of "pork tactics" today.
Wow chris 2 videos in less than a week!! Impressive!! 😘😘
Watching this has made me trying those sake🍶!  You should try all kinds (more than 10,000 kinds) of sake throughout Japan and share the videos😆
Jon ju hatchi desu
Congrats on the two million subscribers Chris 😊
The best bit is being abroad in Japan, it said it on the title, I need a holiday badly.
👺
Not sure what the title has to do with anything
I love that hotel! I’d go for the drinking and that hotel.
When I grow up, I want to be Ryotaro. There, I said it.
7:41 could it sound wrong because of what 'porking' means in British slang?
Two videos in one week? CHRIStmas confirmed.
Have you heard about the channel "A board in Japan", so cool videos about boards.
You 2 are the best
Chris should do a video in the foreseeable future with Shibuya Kaho 🔔
That was entertaining!
1:30 is a FACT. Ahaha love you, Ryotaro! Thank you for making Abroad less grim and sarcastic haha
I really enjoy your channel- but this episode made my day - thank you.  🤣 it may be the wine BUT I “lol” 🍷😂.
Drunk Ryotaro is adorable
Chris is getting quite plump
He is always so mean to risottoro 🤣🤣
6:38 this tonkatsu is now one of the reasons why i want to visit japan
Congrats on making it to the 2 mil. Here's to the next 2.
Give us a visual reason to call him Cheese-ottoro, please, Broad. 😂
If I was there, i'd just want to be near you guys.  I envy ur time there.
What's a board doing in Japan?
Pork Tactics would make a good band name.
Congratulations Chris and "the team" and all the subscribers and supporters. Next stop at 5M Subs...
Congratulations to the 2 million subs Chris! You've more than earned it and I hope you get 8 million more at least!
The bromance between Ryotaro and Chris may have peaked during this episode.  Please sustain this energy by consuming sake every hour until the end of time.
i adore your banter with ryotaro
The best thing is you guys having fun.
i love Ryotaro . Chris stop bullying him !!
I wish I living your life!! Gratz on hitting two million subs!!
That Panko breading drawer is a great idea. If you’re a restaurant that deals with lots of Panko I don’t think there’s any other way to go but the drawer!
I'd go to Gunma just to drift down Mt. Akina
Chris Board Game coming Summer 2022
Japanese James Bond gets drunk.
When I heard the city pop intro I knew you were a man of culture
instead of shinobi tactics. Pork tactics.
Damn don't let Nestle find this stream!
Lmao I love that Chris need to flee away from Ryotaro now and then to regain his sanity
BEEEEEEEEEFFFFFFFFF
beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeef
pork tactics were the best, since i have always done that too XD
That is some crystal clear water
Ryotaro is right! From all this pork Chris will indeed become Chris Broad!
'I don't want to say the word cute, because it goes against my character' *says cute* idk why I found this so funny haha
Square Enix has not released a better RPG since Pork Tactics.
Drunk Ryoto is kinda savage hey 😆 Funny. You should get him drunk more often 🤣
Pork Tactics Strategy RPG Coming in Spring 2022!
Congratulations 🎊🍾🎉 on reaching 2 million subscribers! Keep up the great work, really enjoy your videos 🤩
Need Ryotaro-san to be drunk in all future videos ...
That sake definitely kicked in hard for Ryotaro.
I really love this documentary type content! Keep up the great work Chris!
How have I never noticed that Chris is left-handed?
Best part: Hot tub. What a sweet suite!
💕💕👌
I wish there were more videos released regularly (esp ones that involve Ryotaro!)
Thanks for all the great content! This was a nice fun way to celebrate. :).
You should make a vlog channel where you act as obnoxious as humanly possible in public and call it "a sod in japan"
Terrible twins 🤣🤣🤣🤣. Sarcamastic friendship ever! Absolutely a joy to watch always :)
it needs a quick snippet of the next morning at the end (is Ryotaro hungover? did he snore all night?)
Honestly I wana try that bed the lovely hobbits broad out
Awesome video!
Drinking water from a stream in Japan: Cool and refreshing Drinking water from a stream in the UK: Instant hospital trip
Isn't Risottoro naturally drunk?
Congratulation for the 2 million subs!
Great video
Half Life intro? 10:34
I'd take pretty much everything except straight spring water. I'm not interested in getting brain amoeba.
Cheers, I'll drink to that.
revenge for shoving in the snow
really love this channel!
Greetings from Germany Ryotaro!!! (We dont always drink beer everyday Chris😉😂)
Pork Tactics sounds like something you'd find on a t-shirt in a daiso
10:35 A game you say? Like the train from the start of Half-Life 1 perhaps?
Congrats, Chris Board! Fantastic achievement, well deserved. I'd go for that porktastic Tonkatsu. As for that ryokan, to quote Ryotaro: "Wow!"
The best thing obviously was the sake, cause alkohol always rules
Good job crisp rod
Those are some porktastic pork tactics! Lolol
Congrats Chris Bond! Also Drunk Ryotaro is hilarious !!
i love to watch your little adventures
I've always wanted to ask if you're the one approaching the groups or if it's the groups that approach you. And if you're the one to do it, how do you go about it? Do you send an email saying what you do asking if you could do a video about them?  Edit: you've been looking so good on your last videos!
the bromance is real
I've been watching this channel for 8.5 years?  Nothing wrong with the channel, but not only do I feel old, I sit and wonder where the time went.
Ryotaro only further strengthens the fact that no one will ever understand the Japanese psyche.
I'll have whatever Ryotaro is having!!
Ryotaro is such a genki drunk. It's adorable.  xD
Congratulations for the 2 million subscribers, Chris! You really deserve it. You really are a dedicated person (especially on Cycling Trip, where you worked with people to create a series of great documentaries). My other favorite youtuber from my country that lives in Japan already hit 7 mil subs, so i hope you will get it soon too.
Do English and Japanese people have the tradition to watch directly in their eyes when they said cheers? I didn't see this good tradition during the video. Chris, great job and keep the nice work
ryotaro is the japanese physical comedian that youtube needs
Ryotoro going for the deep dive with all the sake this episode xD  I could see the fear in Chris' eyes as he was in mortal danger.
I'd have slept in the walk in closet! LOL  I have heard of sake made from sweet potato and mountain yams.  I'd like to try those kind, but don't know the brands to see if my liquor store carries them.
Japanese soccer video?
ton katsu is great and I appreciated being able to get it at the train stations. Chris gets more blunt, Risottoro signs. :)
Drunk Ryotaro is best Ryotaro
let me come and chill for a week lol
That self driving car feels like the opening for Hal-life
I'm here for double the daddy energy.
Does the camera have fish eye on it? People tend to look a little wider when standing far to the left or right (and no, this is no fat joke)
Omg you're left handed :D That's awesome haha, me too ;3
Your quality improved a lot! New camera??? Or just feel like that?
2M BABY LETS GOOOOOOO
Imagine sitting in a wonderful forest with snow, drink sake and still get paid. Life can't get any better xD
board in japan
Pork tactics are pork-tastic.
that sake looks absolutely amazing
All you guys have to do is change your seats and the elbow bumping problem is solved👍
I don't think I ever have watched cris actually ask what something was called in japanese wack
Drinking sake in the forest can't be beaten, surely.
Congrats on 2M+  I remember the old vids when you started- always gr8 content.
Pork tactics was the best.
Some is not full of high functionality with some beer/sake in him ;). Congrats on reaching 500k Chris..heh.
Been watching this channel for at least 4 years and I'm just now realising Chris is left handed
11:00 my boy is already turnt 😂👌
New Channel name: A Bored in Japan...
Jelly:"we're going to a cicling competition, wanna come?" Board:"nah, going to get drunk with dad"
Chris make a video of you reacting to your first ever video you uploaded on your channel! :3 as part of the 2m subs celebration!
With how much these two bully each other I can only imagine them aggressively making out as soon as the cameras turn off lol
These videos are always so fun to watch!
Me ( an Argentinian ) at 13:13: ???
Look at all that $12 sake that Cdawgva would never drink
Pork tactics? Obviously sake inspired XD
"Pork-tactics" has to be the next shirt! Congratulations Chris! Love the channel and always makes my day
Slightly drunk Ryotaro is the best😂
Awww, I was expecting some quality bonding time between you and Ryotarou in the room's onsen
I’m in love with Ryotaro. He single?
Congratulations Chris. The videos are always strangely bizarre but hugely entertaining. Pork tactics included.
If i go to japan the only thing i want to do is eat 🤣🤣🤣🤣
The food looks amazing 🤩
your videos always make my day just this bit better, i want to thank you for creating such entertaining and awesome content
Congrats Chris! Hope you had a great time with Ryotaro. Here for the 3 Mil! Would appreciate some insight into pork tactics ngl
I feel like drunk Ryotaro is how people should be reacting to staying in that nice of a room. Hilarious!
Haha, I feel that although Ryotaro laughs off all of fat Chris's insults, he secretly resents him. Constant disrespectful and dishonorable behavior towards him.  Slowly sharpening his Katana.
Oh man, Ryotaro was hammered!!! too funny!
I would love to try it all one day. 😊
Slightly drunk Ryotaro is quite amusing
Chris after a long day and Ryotaro pissed? What a beautifully horrendous combination 😂🖤
why does Ryotaro have to avoid drinking? does he have a condition or is it out of preference?
The funny point: He has been painting Japanese, he’s drunken on public!
"Chris Board" more like "Chris Bored."
Congratulations on the 2M subs! I've been watching since you were a fatter and smaller youtuber! Cheers~!
Ryotaro is such a riot! Always cracking a joke somehow or another
Them golf buggies reminds me of Jurassic park!
I subscribed for Ryotaro!
Somehow describing spring water tasting like bottled spring water is both self-confirming and disappointing at the same time.
10:50 then Ryotaro gets isekai'd by cart-kun!
Ryotaro is a funny guy : D
Im actually drunk while viewing this
The one thing I hate about traditional Japanese Tonkatsu is the panko has no seasoning.  Not only that I tonkasu sauce is not that great either.  Just leave off the breading and give me a great pork chop instead.
Production quality and the quality of your episodes are so so good. You deserve more than just 2mil subs. Keep up the work love your videos!
Me, who has never drank ever: Hmm, interesting...
You can tell who the designated driver is
Thanks to your channel, we're ready to go visit Aomori in the fall!
hahah Ryotaro is brilliant, good lad ;)
Actually the proper way to drink sake is to NOT pour any for your company, instead chug the entire carafe while rubbing your middle finger all over their face, never breaking eye-contact. It takes quite a bit of skillful coordination.
Most comments are about Ryotaro, so it is fair to say that 1.5 million of the subscribers are of Ryotaro.
I have to say, that pork tactic is a rather poor tactic.  The edges are the crunchiest, so you should eat it while it's freshly fried.
I want to do all of the these things.  Delicious pork and sake breweries?  Sign me up.
cries in tattoos
Ryotaro really is something special
Did you updated your gear? Video quality looks different, greatly
I want to "try" those sake!
The best thing was the panko drawer. I don't know why, but the fact that the chef just nonchalantly opened a drawer full of panko to slap the pork in amused me.
chris shits on ryotaro so much, its so sad.  like so much unprompted bullying
Ryotaro? Drunk? Neveeer..  This video should just be "Me and Ryotaro get pissed and muck about in a Japanese inn".  Jokes aside, the quick uploads are much appreciated. Nothing better to finish off my weekend with a surprise ABiJ video.
Congrats!! 2 million!!
13:12 ngl I definetly wasn't expecting Risottaro to sing about evita... lol
Nice
ah yes my favourite Final Fantasy: Pork Tactics
Love resottero
the view from that hotel room is so nice!
Pork tactics...porktastic!
3 miilion subs needs to be a wagyu extravaganza
Is there no Corona there? I'm in my 3rd lockdown here in Greece.
I really want my own pet Ryotaro😂
Japanese Schnitzel, interesting. :P
OMG! I love drunk Ryotaro ❤️
If i were to drink from the thames id die from all the feces, car batteries and witches in the river.
Drunk ryotaro is the best
Thanks for sharing your journeys guys, I really enjoy watching you. I love the down to earthness vs. the relaxing things you do vs. Imagining how great it must be to be drinking while working hahaha. Loving your vibes ❤
If I  see Tonkatsu it reminds me of a good quality Schnitzel.
As I watched you eating and drinking and talking about 2M subscriber,  my thoughts drifted back in time and I pictured the two Samurai girls sitting across from you.
new video 3 days after the previous video, nice!
this was a very fun video, just two friends joking around
Drunk Ryotaro is so cute!
Lefties Unite! Even more respect to you.
I don’t like how rude you are to my favorite rice dish risottoro
Ryotaro being run over my cart was good! but OMG Drunk Ryotaro is amazing!!!!
the sake with the bunny and the moon, reminds me of Chang'e
Pork tactics are porktastic.
Title says : staying in an inn What it really is : food
You know I think "park tactics" sounds funny to you is probably because you are thinking of "porking".  Also if you are going down (southwards) the provinces, I really look forward to whay you will end up to in Yamanashi-ken. They've also got some pretty good onsen/ryoukan and nihonshu. At least in my opinion. Oh and a whiskey distillery.
Is there even any prefecture in japan that *isnt* famous for its traditional japanese inns?
Dave: As you can see, Ryotaro is slightly drunk. Me: No I can't tell the difference
Just as Chris was saying about how people in Japan characters switch after drinking alcohol and reveal their deepest dark secret, we now finally know what Ryotaro thinks of Chris by referring to him as 'Chris Bored'
No one’s gonna mention that scary doll?
Ryovita Perron, Japangentina’s First Lady.
one day I will make the trip over
Drunk Ryotaro best Ryotaro even better than Risottaro !
Its always the sashimi for me! I love it so much, i cant wait to one day get a taste of proper authentic fresh sashimi
Chris gets drunk and falls into the river. Next day limited Sake with taste of Britain released from the brewery.
I want to sit in seiza at a kotatsu sipping very amazing tea
Congratulations Chris. You were a crucial part of my preparations for my first trip to Japan back in 2019.
Congratulations, you guys are great.
i want mooooreeeee foood contentttt
I don't think I've seen Ryotaro so excited before!
Congrats for reaching 2 million subs. Keep it up, yes?
Aboard in Japan turns into A Board in Japan
Congratulations!
So, is Chris left-handed?
Only 250 dollars? Peasant.
Asian generally have small noses, while westerners have a “big” nose. Maybe there’s some connections?
Congratz on 2M Chris!!!
Chris is so mean to ryotaro lol
.....
Jokes aside, Ryotaro seems like a genuinely good friend. Congratulations Chris and hopefully I will get the chance to actually visit this year after my trip was cancelled last year.
I thought tengu was that bottle thing with the hole in it.....
Congrats at reaching over 2 million subs! :D That food looked really tasty.
Abroad in a tan, the seasonal beach episode.
Ryotoro seems drunk in most of this video 🤣
Pork Tactics sounds like a dirty novel.
congratulations, I took a shot on it as well
Do roytaro and natsuki know each other?
Hi Ryotaro from Argentina indeed! haha, we will try not to cry for you!
Congratulations Chris, you're the best.
the two friends
Bet you any money gintoki already peed on those stream, savour the taste
Came for Ryotaro, stayed for Ryotaro.
man in the abroad in japan dating sim I don't know who Chris is going to end up with. Ryotaro the tsundare or joey the childhood friend.
If Ryotaro is talking about "pork tactics" right now I bet that  in a few years, we might have an "art of pork" being released.
Well over 2 million subscribers now. It's amazing.
Suprised Harld Baldr has not appeared for the Pork Tactics
A video on Gunma and there isn't even any tofu. Disappointing.
I love how your channel and videos have morphed and changed over time. Such an incredible production!! Keep up the work and we'll all see you on Netflix sometime soon.
👺
How are you uploading 2 videos in a week?! You are amazing
0:00 xqc
whatsl is best saki to buy in the UK I never tryed it before that or u can help fellow brit out send me a bottle of that spring saki and some pork 🤣
porc tactics looked really sweet. also the area looked aweome.
Can confirm, I subscribed for Ryotaro.
I'd love to drink the cold spring water from a wine glass.
Chris, your videos are a ray of sunshine in a cloudy day... my wife and I always watch your vids. You’re The Sh@t!!!
Absolutely love the channel been watching for ages, thanks! you deserve all the subs and more to come :)
Congrats on the 2 million. Cheers 🍶
8.5 years of watching this channel. I consider it time well spent. Congrats on all the success! Might I suggest a sequel to the biking journey across Japan. This time you jog...A Jog in Japan!
Love your videos Chris. Thanks for all the great content.
Just a great friendship.
...The truth is I never left you...
"Pork Tactics" is the name of the Abroad in japan porn parody.
Unpopular opinion: Ryotaro > Natsuki
2 videos within 3 days? what?
Drunk Ryotoro is my favorite Ryotoro
The quality of your videos keep getting better and better. Keep up the good work
The drunker Ryotaro gets, the more the R's roll
The more drunk Ryotaro gets the more his Japanese takes over, the more drunk Natsuki gets the more his Japanglish takes over
I actually ‘oooh’ed out loud when Ryotaro took the first bite of that tonkatsu and it crunched so beautifully. I’ve never been more envious of another human being in my entire life.
Great video Chris, I want to try all the things you and Ryotaro did.
Drunk Ryotaro is fun Ryotaro
I absolutely love your videos. I hope I can get over to Japan one day its been my dream since I was 14..
Another episode of Chris making me hungry for things i will never get to experience
Pork tactics !!!
Ryotaro is literally SO hot omg
good
I would LOVE to stay somewhere like that, it’s an absolute dream for me! I’m visiting Japan this year hopefully. I wish something like this was in my budget!
Drinks water straight from the source of a spring... "Tastes just like a bottled spring water" Brew Master: Why did we even bother with this guy?
After all these years watching I just now noticed that Chris is left handed...
How do you organize your thoughts into videos? I'm just getting started on Vlogging and I just realized how hard it is to stay on one topic, any tips? :)
3:29 - Risottoro casually having a pee upstream.
my goodness... what kind of loser would thumbs down this? At the time of my viewing 41 haters and 13k likes... I've been with you chris since 500k! Congratulations to your milestone of 2 million+ subs!!
Wow the shot at 05:07 looks so pretty
Ryotaro completing a video game is like finding out at the end, you were the villain all along.
Best thing was the tour of the huge rooms. I also loved that the springs were so clean you could literally dip a glass into one and drink from it. I was wondering why does the 'onsen' look like it's overflowing? Is that normal? Lastly congrats on your 2 million plus viewers! I always enjoy the videos with you and Ryotaro! It's definitely a love/ hate relationship. But at least you have fun!
おめでとうございます！This was a great look at an area that I didn’t know all that well, or know much about! Would love to hear more about that tengu temple!
Can confirm. I subscribed Abroad in Japan only because of Ryotoro and the former London Radio DJ from Hartlepool
All the food looks amazing.....and that view is spectacular.
Congrats for the 2m subscribers, completely deserved for sure! Thanks for all the content!  P.s. The best from the video was, without doubt, wasted Ryotaro. He's so cheerful XDDD
Don’t forget Natsuki !!!
Ryotaro just says Argentina, so as an Argentinian I can say your Tonkatsu are just Japanese Milanesas.
Really cool to see ryotaro's English improving
sukiyaki looked amazing ! and so did that osen . gotta go there next time im in japan. hopefully they dont kick me out because of tattoos lol
Every now and then ryotaro sounds like he's from the east end of London.  Hes like Japan's version of gino d'campo who's really from Sheffield.  Ryotaro from Shoreditch
That Pure Sparkling Sake looks so good! Seeing as I won’t get to travel to Japan for a while, I wonder if there is a way to get it in the UK! 😅
!!!! I'm so excited that you are showing off Gunma! It's my favorite prefecture! Highly underrated place to visit.
I want to get drunk with Ryotaro
fuckin ryotaro saying innit is a national treasure
I really need to travel to Japan xD I would try basically everything you just did :))
As a German who loves Schnitzel I can say that Tonkatsu is heavenly❤️
It's funny, I discovered your channel and shared it with my with and she subscribed and watches all your videos.  She said I needed to watch this one and imagine my surprise at finding that I  was not subscribed to you.  I have rectified this.  Congrats on your 2 million subscribers and another wonderful video!
Only three days since the last upload?? Chris, you're spoiling us
Handheld dolly zoom? Nice
I have no reason to but my mom is from Gunma so I also have Gunma pride! WOOO!!
5:09 That shot of Ryotaro and the brewery owner sat near the spring drinking the sake would look great as part of a commercial for it
Nice Half Life reference
Congrats on the 2 million viewers!  ...also, we need to get Ryotaro drunk more often.
Ryotaro is better when he's drunk! LOL
Hope you had a great time there! Greetings from hungary!🥳🇭🇺
Guys I cannot find this "yutorian" inn/ryokan for the life of me
😂😂😂 you guys got the worst Kawaba beers, should have tried their IPA and pilsner
Drunk Ryotaro is like the fun uncle in family meetings.
Pork tactics. I was chuckling like a moron for like 5 minutes after that. Mizubasho is about $25 usd for a bottle. Ryotaro getting wasted was hysterical. 😂
I asked for more vids right after the second to last one, and now what do we have here!??!    I still want more tho <3 U and Ryotaro is such good travel companions, its like u fill in each others gap of entertainment, and together we get everything!
Great video! Beautiful cinematography and handsome hosts! Can't ask for more!
Two bros, chillin in a hot spring. Five rooms apart cause they're not gay.
i want to try all of it off course!
Thank you, 4:50 I got an Anohana PTSD flashback.  I hate this video
Who knows the tengu from Detective Conan?
Congratulations on 2 million! Well deserved! I love how your film techniques have evolved as this channel has grown. Every video is so well produced and aesthetically pleasing. I always look forward to the next video to see where in Japan you are.
"Pork Tactics" is the name of my new video game themed grunge band.
Drunk Ryotaro isn't something I thought I needed in my life.
sake tasting by the stream was so magical! Would love to do that when I visit! Kanpai and congrats Chris!
It just hit me that this is the only YouTube channel I’ve watched since the beginning and the only channel where I’ve consistently kept up with new videos. All them subs are definitely deserved I say 😊
Ryotaro drunk seems like a barrel of laughs tbh.
The quality of these videos just continues to improve
If I went to Gunma I'd certainly try doing some kansei dorifto
I want to try all the food in Japan
2M subs but still no Ken Watanabe. When are you going to have him on your channel?
Congrats on 2 mill subscribers mate! Well deserved!
The tonkatsu looked amazing. It was super thick. It was like a pork chop.
to Ryotaro: Where in Germany?
Funny to see you all sweaty from the hot sake! Ryotoro really got slammed though. I loved the room, especially the sculpted wooden pictures on the walls. Congratulations on hitting 2 milion subs! Amazing content <3 keep it up!
Great place to bring your girlfriend for a long weekend!
I always need something to eat while watching ANY Abroad in Japan to avoid drooling over the food Chris is always showing in his videos. Is it just me?!
Always love a Chris A Board vid.
Best part of the video (or at least the part I'm most jealous of): drinking sake in a forest next to the spring where the brewers get their water. Can I just... live my life there? 🥺
Where did Ryotaro buy his jacket? can he do a, wear wat he wears?
Weizen in Japan? I'd dare to try that, Im from Bavaria in Germany and that's like our Nationality drink here  lmao
RYOTARO!!!!!!
Starting at around 12:30, check out how gorgeous Chris's eye color is....love it!
Congrats on 2M subs. Cheers to the next 2M. I also have to wonder if that's 250$ per night.
"pork tactics" are usually set in motion on the 3rd date
Been watching you guys for years now! Keep up the great work I'm heading to Japan next year finally!
Ryotaro=urokodaki
Hey look it's Ryotaro and his sidekick Chris!  :D
What’s important about tonkatsu: the only two ingredients which this dish is made of. The pork and the batter. :D
i love me some tonkatsu...great video
$250 for all that!? Wow that's a great deal! Did it include the meal too? I have paid over $500 for a single night in a hotel before and it wasn't anywhere near that large or nice. The view wasn't as pretty either.
LOLOL, aw, Ryotaro is my favorite ;-)
Love this video... What a fun way to travel .....
I like that you're choosing to show yourself speaking more Japanese with the locals, I don't think it's alienating to the audience at all and makes you appear more respectful and relatable!
DEMON SLAYER INTRO
Ryotaro is great and all, but he's no Natsuki!
What flavor dipping sauce did you dip the Tonkatsu in?
Congratulations on your 2M subscribers! Thank you for another amazing video. I really love this video. I’m from Gunma Japan and living US now. Next time when I can go back home, I’ll definitely check this place out.  I really drink sake, but those glasses of sake looks so good and refreshing. これからも楽しい動画待ってます〜
well oiled risottoro is best risottoro
The camera quality is amazing... Your camera/video skill is amazing too btw, good job
Chris have many identities  - Chris Broad - Chris Abroad - Chris Board - Dave in Japan - Abroad in a Pan
That self driving cart gave me James Bond vibes somehow.
Wow, 2 videos in the same week from Chris. What a treat!
Don't you just love drunk Ryotaro?
Oh that Tonkatsu looked amazing. Grats on 2m subscribers!
Riottoros English is just perfect once he's drunk :D
The best thing is drunk ryotaro
You can really tell Chris is enjoying filming drunk Ryotaro way too much.
Congrats dude!
video idea: point camera at Ryotaro.  that's it.
Something I think is amazing about Japan is how they maintain their cultural identity and aesthetic while still being at the forefront of modernity and technology.
2 uploads in one week?? We’re getting spoiled this week! 😁😁♥️
A drunken Ryotaro should appear in more of your videos.
I love how Ryotaro thanks us for Chris's 2mill subscribers and asks when "we" started the channel
Very cool vids. Vicarious viewer hear and loving it (thumbs up emoji)
Always fun when you team up with Ryotaro
I love drunk risotto
Ahhhh paradise.....We would try all the sake and amazing food! Congrats!
I miss ryotaro, tbh this chanel is loneliness without ryotaro
Congrats on 2 million!! Lol love the banter they always have. Hope there is vegetarian/vegan friendly food option, think that's one of the things I struggle with when visiting new places. 🤔
Ryotaro is completely losing it. By far my favorite version of him.
Second video of yours featuring craft beer have you any plans to do a journey across Japan highlighting these breweries and distilleries? Could treat it like the "Golden Mile" in A Worlds End
Drunk Ryotaro is the "BEST" Ryotaro!😵😂  Congrats for the 2M Chris!🎉🎊
I want to try the water from the stream. Looks refreshing.
Chris monetizing his luxurious indulgences again.. Here take my view and my like..
Drunk Risottoro assassination plan: "Ok, so kill him with..... Oh, drunk me....  drunk........... drink....... alcohol! Use Alcohol!"
Glad to see another video so soon!
Congrats on your 2 million subs! Keep up the good work.
Congratulations!  I managed to find our channel during the pandemic and I am so glad I did.  Thank you for being awesome and for introducing me to many other awesome Youtubers who I also now follow!  It has definitely saved my sanity during all of this.  Also, can't beat pork tactics.  I actually do the same thing lol
I want to try it all Chris.  All of it.
I wonder if there was a deer that pissed up stream..
I love that every time Chris has Ryotaro in a video... its not the foreigner acting like a dork in public in Japan... its the actual Japanese guy. 🤣
Congratulations for ur 2M subs 👏👏, it was because of ur videos that me and my girlfriend went to Japan in 2019, amazing holidays 🖖
120KG
Actually put it back on. Relax chris you didn't need to kill the guy
Pretty sure Risottoro and I are the same person, drunk - both singing Broadway hits on our balconies when the chance arrives.
i love the Japanese wood carving wall art, i would love to have one hanging over my front entrance way in my uk home. i hope to know more on the history and the story behind the carvings.
I don't really drink, so all the food in this video is what I'd like to try
"Who wouldn't want to get drunk in a forest?"  No one of consequence.
Oh, I see you didn’t make the Japanese guy speak English so you wouldn’t have to put subtitles. You have matured Chris!
When’s your next food challenge?  If I recall you still haven’t won one.  For shame!
Poor Ryotaro :c
Panados (Tonkatsu) and Sake? What a brilliant combo, I'm in! First time I listen to the podcast reference before I see the video. Congrats on your "M subscribers Mr. Board.
.....
Fantastic!
was that a manfrotto tripod that Ryotoro was holding?
My fav bit was slightly drunk Ryotaro.
Drunk Ryotaro is absolutely hilarious 🤣🤣 Great video as usual Chris!
"it's creepy innit"  Chris you are ruining this man's japanese accent
Ryotaro is the best!  <3 <3 <3
Fellow german fan here. I love your videos. Keep up the good work. And finding the first job in germany cause you dont want to drink that much is funny =D However in germany even the alcohol free beer tastes better than "the best" alcoholic beer in some other places =D And yeah, its like Ryotaro said. Its more like a really chill gathering than an entire "black out drunk" thing. Normally you hang out with several people, enjoying e.g the sun in a park and everybody has got a bottle of beer of any kind or so.  Sure if its going on longer people will get a little bit tipsy (but as german never drunk from normal beer =D ) and it gets even funnier. But I have hardly seen people on those casual occasions going black out drunk or so.
Our boy Risottaro looking fly af in that jacket.
As a black man living in NYC, I looked forward to your videos and adventures around the country of Japan. Thank you for the experience.
Chris and Ryotaro - twins separated at birth? Congrats on another major milestone!
Self driving cart to room? When Disney theme park rides meet Four Season Resorts and Hotels.
Team effort with many people but don't mention Norm from Tokyo Lens who you almost kill with a snowball
Congrats Chris, well deserved 2mil subs.
Is there no quarantine in japan?
The best thing was seeing Ryotaro absolutely ****faced lol
This might well be the ultimate Abroad in Japan video. It's got everything: Japanese culture, great food, Sake, ryokan, and slightly drunk Ryotaro. It's perfect.
Ryotaros English has gotten so good over the past year. Awesome video guys.
I have watched and been subscribed for a long time, yet I only just now got the joke Abroad in Japan. I guess I haven't heard the last name...just Chris.
I wonder if Mario's nose is from tengu...
that's true Riotoro is the (GOT)> :)
Congrats!!
Risottoro hasn’t been plotting to kill you lately, I’m mildly disappointed.
That pork tonkatsu!
Omg Ryotaro is so adorable and extra in this.  What a beautiful location thanks for bringing us all along on your adventures.
My god ,back to back videos.What happened chris!!!
Not me finding ryotaro hot 👁👄👁
Mr. Chris BOARD has been hitting the gym i see!
Half-Life opening cutscene but japanese inn edition
The best part is they're like brothers, messing, congratulating with each other in a positive way. Ryotaro is like the exploring younger brother and Chris is the old man.
Congratulations Chris! Keep up the good work!
Congratulations!
Can’t buy MIZUBASHO PURE in UK😒
Ryotaro is such a genuinely cool dude.
the amagi inn
Great Video 👍🏻
Quick conversion thanks to a Google search:    48 degrees C is 118 degrees F
Congrats Chris on over 2 million subscribers. Definitely not a single boring vid. Even with all the joking around yr vids r quite professional looking. Enjoyed & take care
Ryotaro adds another dynamic to the Videos when he is around  and I love their playful childness that friends can relate too. And Congtats Chris for your hardwork and dedication, making Abroad in Japan what it is today.
-a vegans nightmare  -everybody else this is perfect place to go
I really enjoyed hearing you speak more japanese in this video :-) Keep up the good work Chris! Now I really want to enjoy some sake and eat tonkatsu!
Dear Diary, This is what I did today: Got stared down by several Tengu with my mortal enemy Drank saké Discussed pork tactics with my mortal enemy Drank saké Ran over my intoxicated mortal enemy with a self-driving cart Drank saké Recalled the good times with everyone who appeared on my YouTube channel (conveniently forgot to mention my mortal enemy) Drank beer Signed, Chris Board
7:29 I'm not the biggest pork fan but this looks really good.
When they did they automatically driven cart all I could think of was jurassic park
Oh man, that hotel room...😍 I'm so jealous!!! P.S. Ryotaro's always in style!💖
Ryotengu is my favourite yokai
The feeling you get when you likely won't get to visit Japan until 2022...
Ryotaro is so great
I like your coat Chris.
Chris Board, A bored in japan
My mom’s a lefty, and ALWAYS has to sit on the left side of the table, because she hates bumping elbows when eating 😂😂 and another excellent video!
Watching these pals having a great time, eating and getting drunk, experiencing the great outdoors and acting like goofballs made me remember pre-covid life, and hanging out with friends in new places. Thank you for the nostalgia🙏🌸✨
The pair of you both dodged the salad at lunchtime. Congrats on the 1.5M subs.
I need to see a video where Chris has to do all the things he says he would rather do to bully his friends. For example sleeping in a bag (we can make this a sleeping bag obviously nothing dangerous) over sharing a big luxurious hotel with his friends
should've made a mini video of that night of the guy snoring :D
Wtf drunk Ryotaro singing "No llores por mi Argentina" 13:10
I'd like to try Tonkatsu pork some time as pork is one of my favourite meats
Great feel good video. Glad you rewarded yourself a little!
I'm surprised you allowed Ryotaro the dignity of being "slightly drunk."
Ryotaro is such a stud.
isn't tonkatsu just Japanese Schnitzel?
I would love to stay at that hotel. You could get your daily exercise just walking around exploring. Is this all in Gunma?
Great video as always! Congratulations on 2,000,000 subscribers!  Chris you are truly ichiban! 😎👍 When Ryotaro was jumping to show the high ceilings you should have used some Super Mario sound effects! 😂
The guy peeing upstream 👁👄👁
Is that the Sake that Connor hated on trash taste?
man thats a steal of a deal for a hotel room that nice, ive paid close to five for a room smaller than my bedroom (like the kind of bedroom thats really just for sleep) and it had only a twin bed, not even a queen, though i lucked out once and for $150 i got a nice seaside place that ALSO had in room jacuzzi and a california king bed
So! The thing that makes water so important is the balance of minerals and nutrients that help the yeast and koji thrive. The water in Japan is generally soft (low in minerals) and breweries look for water that has just the right balance to benefit the kind of yeast they use and what kind of flavor they've aiming to achieve.
Congratulations and the whole thing looked brilliant. 😉
That breath taking view from your room. I wish i could be there right now.. (T_T )
I wonder how bad of a hangover Chris and Ryotaro had the next day...  Also, I want to try everything without meat and fish in Japan... Which is a challenge, of course, because most places serve meat.
Any abroad in Japan 10th anniversary plans?
Cheeky
"As you can tell ryotaro is (slighty) drunk"  Ryotaro: wAaAh lookit dAt! 😂
Chrisbroad Lightyear, of Shar-Command.
The Saki Tastings seemed interesting.
10:19 Ryotaro showing off his secret lair xD
Chris’s presenting style reminds me of James Richardson from football Italia.
Bring Natsuki back please
"Slightly."
Ryataro is drunk top of his head
I want to try everything! 😍🤤
As much as I love all the fun little insults that are thrown at Risottoro, I really like getting to see the actual friendship moments the two of you share
I'm not sure if you'll ever read this Chris but your videos get better and better!
Ryotoro is why I watch this channel.
why are you always so mean to risottaro? he seems like a genuinely nice and modest guy who contributed 1.5 M subs to your channel!
This is one of my new favorite videos from Abroad in Japan; don't even know why, this just has really good vibes.
congrats on 2 mill chris! Been here since 100k and man ill be brutally honest i didnt think there were 2 million people cool enough to watch this stuff, now days though i can easily see this a million bigger next year!
Chris board makes another food related video Its free real estate
Awesome video---hilarious as always. Drinking sake in the woods next to the running stream from where it is sourced---how freaking cool is that?? And, the Tonkatsu was quite literally, mouth-watering, thanks for the vlog, cheers!! Edit--the very best videos are the ones where Ryotaro has a drink or two, then he's skipping down a back alley in Tokyo or rampaging through a gorgeous hot spring inn, just classic, thanks for the great videos.
It's ok to call the tiny sake cups cute!
Chris's liver after this video: X-X
I only watch for Ryotoro and Natsuki. 😄
Japanese are always impressed by the amount of alcohol europeans can drink without getting passed out... but honestly im not the best drinker that title goes to my russian employee ...i mean hes crazy...
Congratulations!!!! Well deserved success!
Congratulations Chris and Emperor Risottoro!
hello friends
Drinking some Desperados watching this and now I really want to have some of that Sake.
Chris, have you visited the soaplands? I have to know.
The Tengu ! The slayer of vanity, I love that guy.
Hey Chris, I’ve been following your channel for a few weeks now. Even before finding your channel I’d always wanted to live in Japan or at least work there for a few years. I don’t mind teaching English there, since I’m about to start my major in Japanese soon. But are there any other jobs I can apply for in Japan from the states? What preparations should I make?
What's up with that traditional hearth? Never seen one of them in use even though I have one in Animal Crossing lol
Chris did a very good job at the end holding in his drunkenness, he's both legible and slurring his words
Ryotaro’s extra funny when he’s drunk! 😂😂🤣
Chris Broad: doesn't upload for 3 months also Chris Broad: uploads twice in the same week
Ryotaro really throwing that beer arond so much he spilled it.
Not gonna lie, a drunk ryotaro is kinda terrifying (in a good way)
Such a wide man
Love any videos with both Chris and Ryotaro 😍
First of all, congrats on the 2M mark subs Chris! well done! I have been following you since you started (from my personal account) and I saw your channel gaining momentum and becoming what it is today! there's no substitute for hard work, well done mate! Hope one day I'll meet you, next time I'm in Japan, as I never had the courage to approach you since I was never in the YouTube scene.
Ryotaro: "tall Americans" Me, a Dutchman: 🤕
That tonkatsu is thiccccccc
It's so weird to be watching you guys eat tonkatsu while I am eating a tonkatsu curry.
PORK TACTICS
The first alcohol I ever tried was Sake, and I've never forgiven it.
there is only one thing that i don't understand - what's the point of promoting japan's locations when there is no tourism in sight. ;'( great vid, tho. as always. <3 Chris.
Congratulations Chris 🥂🍾🎉🎉 I loved that you were taken to see the spring that goes in to the sake. 😀😍💙💙👍👍👍XXXX
I love this channel so much Every video feels like a documentary The quality in next level
I cannot believe he introduced what gunma was famous for and didn't mention initial D
I want to try it all but the Sukiyaki in particular for sure
Stunned to find out Chris has 3 times the viewers of Sharla. We need an investigation. LOL
Ryotaro after a few sake cups: (Goes to the balcony) You see this my son? Everything that the sun touches is my domain.
Congrats mate! Roll on 3 mill! I can imagine there are a few people that aren't familiar with the British sense of humour that think you are just being outright rude to Ryotaro. Wishing you all the best for the next 8 years worth of adventures no matter what it is you choose to do.
Congrats on 2 Million subs!
10:22 "Where you wanna go luv?"
you know I like Ryotoro it feels like he is the comedic relief in the video not to say your not funny Chris but Ryotoro just has a different vibe in the video.
Well deserved, you put so much effort into your videos and it shows. Congrats on 2 million subscribers! All your videos are quite enjoyable to watch can't wait to see what comes next!
Yeah... Not only Ryotaro is slightly drunk :D
Congrats for over 2Mio subscribers from Germany. Thanks a lot for your hard work. Likeing the combination of the country, being interested in, and your brittish humor.
the humor between Chris and Ryotaro is just fantastic
Fully rate your coat Chris
I've been watching Chris for years now, how did I not realise he was left handed??
I love ryotaro and Chris vids
Everytime I hear "gunma" I have to think about the useless detective from detective conan
Dried sardine is hella good. Best for as a snack while drinking, or snack overall. Goof video once again👍
Congratz Chris on 2M subs!!!  Well earned mate.  Ryotoro, you will get there soon enough man providing there are now self driving golf cart accidents...
Is that hashioki a literal fish hahahah? 13:56  Edit: oh good you pointed it out lol Great video as always mate
I had fun watching the video .... and I want to drink the sake out of the sake creek! Also I need pork tactics to achieve that!
I love all the references to video games
Stayed here for a week when I visited, Gunma is serene.
Gunma famous for my Boi Takumi Fujiwara and his tofu hachi roku
10:22 "Hey you.  You're finally awake."
Congrats Chris and everyone else who are featured on the channel for the 2million! This was very heart warming video as well, even further increasing my interest in Japan 😁, the only downside that still cant experience it first hand, but Im sure its just gonna get sweater with the waiting for it. 😅
drunken Ryotarou has even more chaotic energy somehow
A Board in Japan
Changing channel name to "Drunk in Japan".
Congratulations on 2 million subscribers! You deserve it, your videos are great!
who is doing the beer count since he started this channel: guessing 2 oil tanker ships
Ryotaro is like a happy dog, and Chris is like a cynical cat hahaha.
Ryotaro the kinda drunk that repeats the same story till you have to scream "YOU'VE SAID THAT !" and they just laugh at you and continue the story lol.
yeah in Germany we drink beer but during work it's absolutly forbidden also we rarely have any "company meetings" where people drin. Only maybe on the christmas party which some companies do. There might be some colleagues who get drunk but that never happend in the companies i worked for. Also during buisness meetings it's totally not custom to drink any alcohol :-) so no Nomikai.  also reading WEIZEN beer on a Japanese beer bottle made me laugh xD
And, of course, to balance out all of the sake and the delicious looking pork, I'd be seeking out the sweets. Whether they're simple sweets like dango or mochi, or even some sort of local sweet treat, I'd be seeking out the sugary stuff! Then again, that comes with having a major sweet tooth like I do...
So, drunk Risottoro can’t stop talking, destroys everything and breaks into musical tunes. 🤣
do you even advertise bro?
That tengu mask remind me kimetsu no yaiba
New t shirt design - “Pork Tactics, So Wrong” 😂
12:35 BREAKING NEWS BRITISH MAN SUFFOCATES IN BAG IN AN ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE JAPANESE MAN
I now get why risottoro never drink alcohol
Congrats Chris, you deserve it <3
I wish I could subscribe twice
It's very cute that Chris and Ryotaro wore matching outfits for this special video. Such a cute couple.
This is one of the most professional channels I follow. It's always a joy to hear from you. You have a good editor and a camera man.
Alcohol does wonders when it comes to the composure of the Japenese doesn't it? x)
Thank you, Chris! Your content is amazing!
love when risottoro is in the video!
You are a lovely couple.
Hobbits !! haha that made me laugh so hard haha
Pork tactics is something Natsuki would say. Or maybe Pork Justice.
I'd pay $250 to spend a day with Chris...
Hey Chris! If you haven't already, i highly recommend watching this new documentary called Age of Samurai: Battle for Japan. Very interesting! Its on Netflix.
Pork-tastic
To find balance and inner peace, one must apply : "pork tactics"
Chris Board, less successful cousin of Chris Broad, who's being held hostage by Dave. All three are renown practitioners of Pork Tactics.
Pork Tactics, coming soon to the Nintendo Switch
congrats on 2 mill subs!
Still no sumo videos....
Go to the sea more
ughh everything looks amazing there! ty for another great vid!
Just ordered a bottle of mizubasho pure to try myself. I live in Northern Ireland, I purchased the sake from France and travel restrictions permitting I will be heading to Japan for a 4 week holiday in October. Everything you have shown just makes me more excited to visit and explore the country
The tonkatsu looked really good. Now I'm hungry.
Its actually not purity that makes the water taste the way it does but all the impurities and minerals it contains from the environment, if you wanted a hundred percent pure water you would just boil and distill water
Hey, you. You're finally awake. You were trying to reach your Ryokan room, right? With that accent smuggler over there.
F*** SAKE
The view from the room is amazing! 🤩
omg.  i must try that tonkatsu someday.  looks heavenly, for certain.
I just love you Chris! I want the Sake and the first dishes in the hotel, looked like sashimi and other delicious things. The water from the stream and the sake were something special. I can´t believe you are a lefty, even better. Congratulations on 2m you deserve it.
SAKE!!!!! SAKE!!!!! SAKE!!!!! SAKE!!!!! SAKE!!!!! SAKE!!!!! SAKE!!!!!
Today, we glimpse into Japan's Board Era as Emperor Risottoro instructs Dave in Japan on how to effectively use his new "pork tactics"
Waiting for the small circle on screen with Chris saying "Sugoi!" after every drink 😂
Wow Chris very good quality good job👍
Man, Ryotaro was so drunk here.
Such a blessing to see another Abroad in Japan's video after 3 days.
Wait... Chris is a tsundere.
3:34 lemme guess. It tastes like water
Got to be honest, i fancied the spring water straight from the spring...Not many places you can just pull out crystal clear water.
I could live at that hotel. I suspect that I would live forever, then.
I've never tried Tonkatsu, but it looks DELICIOUS!  2 million subs, Chris! Congrats!
I had a co-worker named Nagai who worked at a Tonkatsu restaurant. How weird.
METAL GEAR SAKE: Tactical Pork Action
Can I just come to Japan and eat food with you? Ill pay!
woldn't be Abroad in Japan if there wasn't food involved!
Ryotaro drunk was the funniest shit ever
You're welcome! You couldn't have done it without me.
Congratulations Chris, I've been here for around 8 years and I still watch every video. You're definitely doing something right
One hundred percent going to use the phrase "Pork tactics" from now and forever onwards.
Nice
Wait a second. Is that Weizenbier? You never should drink Weizenbier out of a bottle! It needs a fine big glass!  https://youtu.be/3n_rgmagVoE?t=1064
So Ryotaro has to try and get 2m subs within 8 years to see who truly has the best pork tactics.
Celebrating two million.. drinking sake near river.. drinking sake all night long :-) Hot sake.. mainichi sake.. congrats Chris!
I’m supremely jealous. Wish i wasn’t such a poor. Emperor Risottaro had a little too much of the good stuff
LIKE THE VID
Congrats on the 2M subscribers, Mr. Broad! I've been told sake tasting is a must-do activity for tourists in Japan, but I have to admit it was a bit of a letdown for me. To my palate, sake tastes like... wine? All of the dozen kinds I tested - white wine, red wine, dry, sweet, sparkling... Which was surprising, to say the least - and as a Frenchman (boo) it saddened me to realize the experience just wasn't new to me. Japanese BEERS, on the other hand... mein gott, they'd give Germany a run for its money.
The friendship was the best part, lmao
Someone was loosey-goosey
So cute how Chris is trying not to use the word cute.
I'm just now noticing Chris is left handed. The hell?
Great video Chris Board! Keep it up!
11:54 How the turns have tabled..
Ryotaro is heart-warming and you two play off each other so well, it's hilarious.
Congratulations Chris, I remember when your intro used to be you running in a garden with a CGI fighter jet crashing behind you and explosions. Many years and many good videos later, you are still growing bigger. Not into a big face, but a really entertaining and educational channel.
Abroad in Japan posting a new video 3 days after another one? A miracle.
Lefties are the devil's minions!!!!!
Oh wow. I never knew Dave Abroad was left handed. 😯
I love Ryotaro. He’s such a bone head. 😂
Incredible work as usual, Chris. Thanks for this!
Livers are overrated, aren't they?
i only watch their videos while being drunk and trust me, they give out the best alcoholic vibe you can find on youtube
Congrats on 2m! One of my favorite channels by far. WE DEMAND MORE NATSUKI!
Ryotaro drunk lol
5:39  "Goonmer is known for..."
:)
Chris and Ryotaro are two tsunderes on a roadtrip.
That Tonkatsu looks absolutely salivating Thanks for making me hungry :(
Chris Board is... Dave in Japan!
Another great video, thank you Chris and Ryotaro! Is there any Sake that you would recommend trying for someone having it for the first time?
I am happy to be one of your subscribers.
Pork Tactics.
I want to hang out with slightly drunk Ryotaro. He seems like a ton of fun, lol.
Ryotaro is getting pepper in his hair!
Is this a new camera? Looks real crisp! Great video as usual haha
I just realized that Chris is left-handed After watching his channel for nearly 2 years I just figured that out today.
Which ryokan was this?
As an Argentinean, Rissotaro singing that song caught me off guard 🤣
I never noticed you have green eyes Chris, I have green eyes as well and am from British descent, I wonder if its a UK thing?
Request for more drunk Ryotaro in future please
To be real, your  content is amazing, I love it, congratulations on 2 million,  and an amazing 9 years, here's to another 9
Congratulations Chris on 2 million subs . All the best from Downunder 👍
Half life: chris edition
Pork tactics
I confirm I'm only here because of Ryotaro. He's the star of the show! PORK TACTICS
i don't know why i continue to watch this XD
congratulations on your 2 millon subscribers
Congrats and thanks a lot for these much needed laughs you provoked with this video! I'm serious, it almost felt like I was really there with you guys hanging out, laughing, eating, getting drunk...
Two episodes in one week, life couldn’t get any better.
4:36 . . . Does this guy kind of look like a Japanese Elon Musk?    Ps. I swear I'm not drinking
Better to be called Chris Board than it would be to be called Chris Bored. :)
Pork tactics has got to be my favorite phrase
Ryotaro  is the best i dont care.
Congrats on the 2 million subs!
Who's idea was it that you guys wear matching shirts?, how cute.
Riotaro smashes the door to the Inn. "Where the sake!?"
Ryotaro, the subscriber fairy
Ryotaro fan girl club ✌🏻
Ryotaro san you make a great Evita. Love from Argentina ♥
Ryotaro: "I really want to sing this song so I'm gonna sing it" type of drunk. Chris: "...Look at you, you're absolutely plastered" type of drunk.
You've come along from bad cgi explosions, Chris!  Congratulations for over 200,000 Subscribers! 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Dadachamame - spring water edition
I've only just noticed Chris is a leftie, mind blown lol
Here for the pork tactics! 😂
Nahh. You’re still monetized.
11:56 poor  Ryotaro
I need someone to looks at me like Ryotaro looks at Chris.
Chris and Ryotaro - the best duo! Works like a charm every time 😘🤗  Congrats on two million subscribers 👏 You totally deserve it ❤
This episode was porktastic!
That's a very beautiful wristwatch Chris, very sleek
Drunk Riotoro is hilarious
One thing that keeps me consistently invested in everything and anything that comes out of this channel, it's how you always manage to really reflect on things around you from the perspective of someone who hasn't grown accustomed to being in Japan. I want to visit and ultimately move to Japan, and I can imagine after a couple of years, things like taking off your shoes and the various customs just get ingrained into your cultural awareness and you just become blind to it. But you always seem to mention and make a note of it, which helps to iterate the differences from western culture.
I really like your content and the rest of your british humour. But - at least for me - it is getting more and more unpassend to watch you, without hoping for a nose surgery at one time 👍
Like everybody else, we all subscribed for Natsuki.
I am here for that tonkatsu (*´﹃`)
Pork Tictacs!
Is Ryotaro's English getting worse?
Heavenly? God forbids pork. You mean "hellishly tempting."
What a thoroughly enjoyable video! Also, now I get why that Instagram livestream from the ryokan suite was slightly manic 😆
The best thing is always the company, cheers guys and congratulations on another milestone.
I have the biggest crush on Chris. Im not kidding. If he could find a way to contact me. Id be extremely happy. :-) I cant be the only one.
finally, the sake brewery episode is released. It looks amazing. Great job!
God I fucking love drunk ryotaro
Drunken Ryotaro  looks fun
It's another chipmunk cheek challenge - eat up boys, winters coming, uh, in another 10 months.
Good lawd how much sake did you guys drink!?
13:47 you're welcome
Damn, I would like to taste sake this way at a tiny river and snow around me!
Pork Tactics and drunk friends 💜
Oh I think I know what I want to do most in Gunma. *turns up Eurobeat*
Drunk Ryotaro was really hyper by the time he got to the inn.
Congratulations Chris, you deserve ten times as many subs... Their loss though
It felt like this video was just a good excuse to get really drunk together! I loved it. Congratulations on the 2m subs. On to the next big milestone!
I NEED MORE DRUNK RYOTARO
those pork tactics look pretty delicious
The image quality is really really good in this video! Did I only notice that now or did you make changes recently? Anyway, love your videos in any quality!
meat aside....my favorite dish of japan has got to be the "Okonomiyaki"
I love the energy between Chris and Ryotaro!
have fun roto
DAT TONKATSU BE THICCCCCCCCCCCCC now im hungry damn it chris
Ryotaro’s English is getting to good he’s not funny anymore😂
Never watch Chris' video without food by your side, or else you'll end up so hungry. Seriously, you make it look so appetizing! Also congrats on 2M subs.
10:49  The moment Ryotaro becomes a light novel protagonist.
Chris Bored is my favourite YouTuber
Congrats on getting 2 millions subscribers. You do great vids and your a great person who has good knowledge and humility. Cheers also for doing vids in hq.
Risottoro's English actually gets better when he's drunk. =p
Congratulate with 2 mill subs, you deserve it.  Is it just me or did Ryotatos english get slightly more fluent after all that sake? A tipsy Ryotaro was fun to watch, you should get him drunk more often Chris. It will problably not help with the snoring though.,
Congrats Chris! You deserve all your success 🎉🌟. By the way... Ryotaro is verrrry handsome 😍. I have such crush!! 🥰
"Pork tactics" reminds me of an order we had at a sign shop I was working at several years ago, and the order was for a Mexican food truck menu sign. They asked us to put English translations under the Spanish, but the only translation we could find for one of the items was "pork mischief". Needless to say, we weren't going to put that on a sign without clarifying what they meant.
What a great intro
I don't trust anyone until I've seen them three quarters paralytic.
13:23 Got some real Arnold Schwarzenegger vibes right there.
ThankYOU for sharing all these interesting experiences with us :) Keep having fun o.o/
I know a lot about one certain mountain in Gunma, at least the roads.
What!? 2 episodes in only 3 days? Madness.
You both have great chemistry together. A joy to watch your banter.
Tonkatsu = Schnitzel ! Cheers 🍻
17:02 Joey the amine nam I think Risottoro is not the only one who has been on the sake :)
Great video Chris, the production quality is incredible, love the annotations with the spelling and translations of certain words. Congrats on 2 Mil!
Tipsy Ryotaro is adoreable ^^
Drunk Risottoro is an interesting addition to the Abroad in Japan cinematic universe.
10:35 - "I feel like I'm in a cutscene from a videogame" - spearkers: "Good Morning and Welcome to the Black Mesa Transit System..." :)
Why isn't  the channel called alcoholics in japan?
Watching this show with ryotaro and natsuki it just seems like 2 completely different shows. Its so good. The richness of this channel is the people in it
good to see you Chris congratulations lose weight you fat bastard  I love you and keep up the uploads
Abroad in Japan is my favourite anime, I watch every episode religiously
"As you can see, Ryotoro is noticeably drunk". Unneeded notification is unneeded.
Congradulations Chris - hope to see another video once you get to 3 million subscribers
Chris Bored
Congrats on 2m subscribers!! :) also ryotaro >_> he's trying to wine and dine you! smooth
It starts with the sound the last one ended with
I love hot sake 🤤
it's really nice to see y'all being nice to each other, it was getting old being adversaries.
So tonkatsu is the japanese schnitzel The more you know
One of the channels I disable Adblock for.   I technically  helped  offset the cost of those $250 by At least $0.0000002
Porc tactics reminds me of Animal Farm...
Chris Bored? what?
Love this channel
Congrats on 2mil subscribers! It all looked amazing.
Pork-tactics TM
Ryotutorial 11:42
You can clearly see the progress of alcoholism over the years 🤣
Love ryotoro
2 millions, fuck, you have to do something right. Personally, I just love traveling Japan with you and Ryotaro. I would love you to introduce us a bit more with the Tottori prefecture. Just a wish for 2021.
Since Ryotaro joined, I have made 1.5million accounts on Youtube to subscribe to this channel. Show the man some appreciation please.
I remember when you had 300,000 subscribers....  big congrats to you!!
I almost didn't subscribe because of Ryotaro. I stayed for the British sarcasm.
Peer pressuring poor drunk rissorato into eating a desiccated sardine, if we don't have another video in a month, we'll know chris was murdered in his sleep. XD
I can’t tell a difference between normal and Drunk Ryotaro and Normal Ryotaro
I love completely smashed everyone is in this video, haha
Someone's been lifting.
These are good youtube videos to watch with my family to help them understand why I like Japan so much, thanks a bunch!
Need to start a series on drunk Ryotaro discussing current affairs
This video is half drinking, quarter eating and quarter doesn't even make sense. Ah how 2 mil has affected you lol
Congratulations on the two million mark. 👏 You and Ryotaro having a great time banging elbows when eating. 😄 Thanks for making such great content and when travel restrictions are lifted, I look forward to checking out many of the places that you and Ryotaro have been to. Thanks so much as always.  Stay safe, stay well, take care, and keep enjoying. 🍻👍
You are not alone Ryotaro, I always start singing Don't Cry For Me Argentina when I am on balcony. :D
Best thing was drunk Ryotaro
I don't know how Chris doesn't have more subs, these videos are all like documentary quality every single time. And they're hilarious!
7:30 the serving size is huge.
Not going to lie. I was totally thinking, "There was a bear that pissed and shit upsteam from that brook you tasted the water from."
Congratulations!  Keep those Japan travels coming.  I enjoy the scenery.
drunk risottaro is more than i can handle.
Everyone needs a friend like ryotaro
Definitely gonna use those pork tactics when I get tonkatstu in japan
Tonkatsu for me please! That looked incredible! Hey Chris, where did you used to teach English? In Sendai? Back in 1999-2001, I lived in Sendai for and taught English at two different English conversation schools right in downtown Sendai near the station; Primary and Stageline. Keep those videos coming, and thanks for introducing us to Ryotaro; I know you don't really like him, but his videos are very entertaining! Congratulations on hitting 2 million subscribers! That's amazing! I'd be happy if I reach 100!😆
Glad to see that Dave and Risottero are keeping up their healthy lifestyle while gallivanting across Japan: Eating just the meat, leaving the salad, and getting plastered in every scene :-). I hope Sharla will join in again sometime as her smile could launch a thousand ships and always brightens my day. Keep up the good word Crisp Rod!
Drunk Ryotaro = best Ryotaro
Seeing that pork in 4K makes it all the more painful that I can't have it.
Lord Ryotoro? What is he? A daimyo? A relative of a shogun? Or just a fraud?
its allways fun to see you guys interact with each other, such a nice friendship, and it allways adds an extra layer of humor to the videos!!!
Congrats on 2 million! Been watching for several years. Well done
Chris is a southpaw?  WHOOOO!  Also, that tonkatsu looks freaking delicious....
I don't eat pork, but I'd be damn tempted to try that...
Lucky for us that Chris has found his calling. The videos get better and better. And congrats on 2 MILLION subscribers!
Imagine being killed to be a chopstick holder 😭😭
Definitely want to go there some day! It looks so beautiful!
Glad to see the dynamic duo making another video!
2 videoes in one week? Chris are you ok? Do we need to call a Doctor?
Cool !!
Drunk Ryotaro is the best thing
I will genuinely watch your spin off channel “Chris bored in Japan”
Two a Broad in a pan videos in 4 days?! Is this a dream?
10:34 Half Life reference or coincidence?
5:35 the guy beating his meat
I think it would be fair to also link Ryotaros youtube Channel in your video Description, if he is in it. Help your firends.
I am a simple woman. I open Abroad in Japan, I hear the word roadtrip, I press like.
came to cleanse my soul after watching the trash taste cycling video
13:36 this moment made me realise that Ryotoro is one of those people I never want to see come near any sort of power, even remotely, let alone become an emperor.
10:29 You’re finally awake
Ahhh! It’s the place where Risottoro’s R-18 live took place! feat a drunk Chris Board! hahah!  Congratulations on 2M+, your channel is so awesome and I’m so glad to have found it 🥳🥳  The tonkotsu is the dish I’d like to try the most ... 🤤
Thanks to Chris and Ellen’s Japanese lesson I know nagai means long...does that make this sake a long drink? 😳 And I really want Nagai-san’s shirt.
"Largest tengu mask in the entire country" This statement implies there are even larger tengu masks outside of Japan, I wouldn't know because I'm too lazy to search
Why is Ryotaro isn't able to drink lots ? I've heard this for the first time
Ryotaro is the BEST
I've got to say, the style of these new videos is a nice throwback to the videos you did before Journey Across Japan. Really nice to watch the relaxed pacing and all your adventures with Ryotaro, especially given everything happening with the pandemic.
You two should have a TV show
Cycle Bicycle Cycle Bicycle
chris wakes up on a self driving cart: Ryotaro: Hey, you. You’re finally awake.
Tengu literally means "sky dog", but its true meaning is "heavenly sentinel" or "heavenly guard", interesting stuff!
Slightly drunk Ryotaro is my favorite Ryotaro
you should make another video with the cute orange lady
Next time, you should put a disclaimer at the start for hungry stoned folk.
Tonkatsu for sure would be what I would want to try, followed by the onsen. I’m sure some sake with happen along the way.
its 12 am and 0:33 made me hungry af, imma go eat crackers now
Drunk Ryotaro is better than normal Ryotaro.
I want to see Ryotaro singing  the whole Evita musical
Chris is so lucky he found a friend like Ryotaro. He takes him too all these great luxurious places!
Love to visit Japan some day. Absolutely beautiful country.....
Drunk Ryotaro is the best Ryotaro.
oh my god, the pork looks so good
It's all because of Ryoytaro and Natsuki, Chris. Otherwise.. Meh..!!
Ryotaro drunk!! Precious
I think its safe to say Ryotaro was more than slightly drunk^^
We used to have a waterfall, in Oregon, named Clear Water Falls. You could drink from it. It was icy and delicious. That was in the 1960’s though. I would love to see this place and experience the cuisine. Thanks for sharing.
Slightly drunk Ryotaro what a treat
Definitely one of the better hotels, I'd stay there.
I'll try Ryotaro.
I like videos with  Ryotaro! :D
Soo everytime Ryotaro is in the video, there's alcohol...
The intro is quite early for a Halloween special
hey chris i want to know really bad what do u do for living, like where do u get ur from
Wait Those are real sardines
Dude I’d love to visit there..looks so beautiful haha. But I will say if it weren’t for Joey the anime man I wouldn’t have found your channel xD   Congrats on your 2 million subs Chris.
17:15 You make a cute couple... ;-)
Tastes like giardia.
“Pork Tactics” – an essential part of Ninja training. 😄
I like drunk Risottoro. Please drink more. Responsibly always.
I think I speak for everyone.. We all love Ryotaro!
Get Rayotaro hammered more often lol
I so want to take a sake brewery tour! And congrats on on reaching 2 million subs!
how do they know nothing has died or defecated up stream?
Jesus drunk ryotaro is scary
I love how, after Ryotoro mentioned at their first meal that you shouldn't sit to the left of a left-handed person when eating, they sat in the same positions for their next meal! I appreciate the sacrifice for the sake (sa-ke 🍶 in Jpn, get it? I know, awful 🤦‍♂️) of continuity even if unintentional. Great video!
Just noticed Chris is left handed
rYOTTAro
"Pork Tactics" if you want to win.  ;-)
Wait... I've been watching this channel for 8 years? I think it's time I finally visit Japan.
So good, Chris you take vacations I can only dream of. Its been awesome watching you this long. Good luck with your channel and everything else Chris!
(Note:  After watching this video, the views I've expressed in this comment have completely changed.)WoWZuH !!!!  37,000+ views in less than an HOUR !?!?  I knew I recognized that smile in the thumbnail.  That's that YouTube money smile honey!  Chris has got to be the most famous gaijin in all Japan.  But man...is it just me or are Ryotaro and Chris actually frenemies (emphasis on the ENEMIES)?  Nothing against Ryo, but would YOU be able to put up hanging out with somebody you didn't like?  They've done so many videos together that I'm surprised there hasn't been some kind of violent incident between the two.  I'd like to ask Chris if he ever encountered a near hit-and-run from a car when he was cycling across Japan...and did the driver have a suspicious resemblance to Ryotaro?   Does Chris ever get suspicious that every time he returns from the bathroom while dining with Ryotaro, that his food tastes extra "Poisony"?  I jest, I jest.  You're on a roll Chris!  Keep it up!  Someone give this man a t.v. show!!!!  Oh!  What do I want?  I want all those wonderful bathing tanks in those hotel rooms.
I know this most likely won't reach you, but your Videos always make me smile, especially if you're with Ryotaro or Natsuki. I love your content Chris, you and your friends are amazing people.
Left handed gang where you at? We are rare.
Drunk Ryotaro is my spirit animal.
As you can tell Ryotaro is "slightly" drunk.
pork
Honestly that inn is such a good deal. I’ve spent close to that to stay at a Hilton off shoot generic hotel in places not nearly as exciting.
Pork Tactics another amazing band name, they can be like Slipknot and wear pig masks 😂
4:06 havn't heard you speak Japanese in a while. We need more!!!! Arigato
As a whisky lover, pairings are important. I'd love to try all the different sake with different food, especially that tonkatsu. I've stayed a sake virgin so far, hoping I can lose it in Japan!
i love ryotaro
Ryotaro is a chaotic crackhead
Man, have some sleep.
Commenting just to fool the YT algorithm on liking Ryotaro.
Congratulations on the 2 million subscribers, Chris. Well deserved!
i have spent $250 in ethereum tx fees in the last 2 weeks
Another banger of a video, as the Trash taste boys would put it. Great job and we'll earned Chris!
Why am i here i sitting down in boring England,  munching on a chocolate digestive, watching two men eat mouthwatering tonkatsu and refreshing sake in beautiful Japan.....? Talk about wrong life choices. Great vid guys, keep it up!
I want to try the pork and the Weizen. :)
Congrats on the 2 million subs Chris, you definitely deserve it for the amazing videos. I'm going to rewatch some of favorite videos that you've made.
now I feel that Ryotaro was drank all the time....
Best thing about the video,  it's you two :)
this calming and heartwarming content is what I live for
I want to visit the inn
Pork tactics  Chris board He won this video 🤣
Imagine a drunk ryotengu lol
risottoro squad unite  !!!!
You both are great :D And this is a very nice Inn!
The sake bottle with the rabbit & moon on it what's it called?
I started watching this video for Chris hitting 2 mil subs and ending up watching for a drunk Ryotaro
Slightly drunk Ryotaro is the best Ryotaro
Charity project 😂😂😂
Wow another video just in three days. Congrats to the 2M. I've watched you since the start, I love Japan and your videos give me the slightest feeling of being there. Especially now with lockdowns everywhere, it's great way to experience what's out there.
Ryotoro and chris seem like such good friends
I love when Ryotaro appears in these videos
Congrats on 2 million subs Dave, glad to be part of the journey for so long. Here's to many more!
I love how the video slowly morphed into a Ryotaro's Japan video after you guys got to the inn. Also Ryotaro's "wHeRe FrOm SiR" had me cracking up.
Just SLIGHTLY drunk
*"Its creepy init?"* - Ryotaro
I would like to try the pork tonkatsu. ❤️😊. I like the chicken katsu curry, pumpkin kurroke,  tempura prawns, adamame peas, teriyaki, gyoza, maki sushi, takoyaki, duck yakisoba and kirin beer. 😍😍😍. Would like to try so many other Japanese meals xx
As a One Piece fan, I've always wondered what the significance of this Usopp-looking mask meant in Japanese Culture.
You know the rules; when Ryotaro is in the video, you have to press the Like button.
watching Ryo get pickled was entertaining, congrats on 2m subs. thank you Ryo for bringing in those 1.5 subs to help out Chris.   im going outside now to practice drinking beer with beer. wish me luck!
He sounds like Borat while entering the room haha, great stuff!
isn’t this the sake that Chris got for the trash taste boys
Chris gets the sake and immediately drinks it... and then is like: oh right, he wanted to drink some too. Uuh, kampai.
Ryotoro reminds me of Yukio Mishima
I only watch this channel for Ryotaro
Should have listed Risottoro instead of not naming Ryotoro
Keep it up Chris Bored
Holy firetruck, I didn't realize you crossed 2 million subs! Congrats mate!
Me: seeing someone drink water from the clean stream. Me also: looking at a shopping trolley in the river themes at Canary Wharf.
*gets on self-driving cart- “Wake up samurai...”
I can only think of the “tengu milk” scene in RoboGeisha
I LOVE that beautiful stream and forest. And that tonkatsu looks sooo good! Beautiful video again. Also controlling the white balance must be pain in that yellowness.
Here in NZ, waking up to this video. Excited to have a good laugh at Chris's sarcasm....   Also thinking ... He's been up too late  to post this video like 3am in the morning ...as a mum of two kids concerning your health haha
I just finished watching the Kyoto video a second ago, and heard the EXACT same sound effect, it added a nice amount of continuity lol
Where is that sake with the bunny and the moon on the front from?
I cant tell if Chris genuinely hates Riotoro sometimes. I come for the travel ideas but stay for Chris to roast Riotoro
Ryotaro's english is getting super good!
This video has me wondering if Risottoro is a bit smashed all the time now.
Next time in Board in Japan with Chris Board.
Jesus, Ryotaro drunk seems to turn him into a wannabe Natsuki.
Congrats on the subscribers!
An Evita reference from Ryotaro was definitely unexpected, but appreciated! 😂
Damn. That inn looks gigantic, I've never seen a hotel of that scale in Japan before, so cool
wait Tengu is sky dog?
登録者数２００万人突破おめでとう！ やっぱり長い道程だったねぇ！ 今の動画で一番やってみたいのはこの旅館で一回泊めたいなぁって思う
Ryotaros ancient secret pork tactics finally revealed
@3:45 ..and few meters upstream there is Ryotoro standing on the side pretending to pee. That would be epic!
Drunk risotto, is the best ryotero.
ryotaro drunk is the best thing ever
Ryotaro's taxi driver impersonation just makes it feel more like a cut-scene.
Ryotaro's Show
ryotaro was absolutely smashed after drinking all that sake
本日の名言： 豚肉策略 chris board
Ry-yopparatte-aro
my favourite c word - content
He's much more handsome then when he first came to Japan.
When you are binging on Chris's old videos, and you suddenly notice a new one pop up. Made my weekend :)
You're the best bud. Keep it up whilst I try relive every video in one holiday(:
In Germany we are dead serious about work, you do not drink with coworkers. You have friends for that.
U should try the contemplation trains!
The Sake guy looks like my uncle
drunk Ryotaro doesn't exist, it can't hurt you drunk Ryotaro: 11:08
Two videos in the same week? It must be CHRIStmas!
You're missing out on a great opportunity if you don't release a pork tactics tshirt lol
Ryotaro before & after drinking is like a whole different person. Before he seems calm and composed. After he's singing Madonna, banging into doors and trying to jump to touch the ceiling.
Drunk Risottoro is very lively and high-spirited
We need the Pork Tactics on the soundboard
Ryoto of course 😂
Congrats on 2 mill
Such chill vibes here. Drunk Ryotaro is so entertaining!!!
I wonder if him taste testing the water triggered his edamame tasting PTSD :))
Well done on the 2mill viewers Board. Serious tho, congrats bud o/
Had to pause a quarter of the way through to congratulate you Chris on another fantastic video! The composition, lighting, editing, music, subject, ... Big fan of your videos, and they keep getting better!
These two together in a video is often the recipe for success on the channel!😂😂
Congratulations Ryotoro on hitting 2 Million Subscribers! Proud of you.
Pretty sure small animals die in the water every day. Birds, mice, etc
By the time you eat all of the worse parts, you'll be too full to eat the best part. - that's my logic for not leaving the best for the last.
Drunk Ryotoro = Ryotoro Peron
I swear with each video my list of new things to do and visit in Japan keeps growing! Absolutely love your videos Chris and the team just adds the extra charm and enjoyment of your videos. This is one of the few channels I have notifications on because I genuinely look forward to see what new video you have next! Even if it’s once again food related lol. Thank you for being who you are and continue to bring 2 MILLION people your well crafted videos.   If you’re looking for something rather new to do for a video, how about trying to find a movie stunt team to bring you and whomever you choose to a movie set to learn action choreography. Hell maybe even film a bit of action with stunts (that aren’t too crazy of course lol). I can definitely see Ryotaro enjoying himself trying to learn to do a flip or fight choreography, whereas Chris might enjoy learning a new form of camera work!
Great video as always!
i want to know more about Ryotoro´s time in germany!
I’m also a lefty and the struggle is real, I bet especially if your sitting next to Ryotaro 😂
Aww. I'm glad you thanked Natsuki. He seems like a real friend.
Thanks Chris, Ryotaro, Natsuki and everyone involved for making this channel informative and fun to watch :)
Congrats on the 2 million Chris Board!
Chris, I’ve been watching your videos for awhile now, and only now do I realize the effort you put into your cinematography and editing. Great work, mate.
You guys just had that feast from every studio gibly film in one day
drunk ryotaro is best ryotaro
Chris : Takes a sip of water and appreciates it Ryotaro: Downs the whole thing like it's a shot
2 videos in 3 days? Yes please 👍
The "hot sake" was -48°C? I'm surprised it was still liquid at that point and not ice.
Missed opportunity: What $2.000.000 Gets You at a Japanese Hot Spring Inn
10:21 Hey you, you're finally awake...
Ryotaro comes on frame mask on. Chris:  take it off Ryotaro, takes off mask: 😁😁😁 Chris: actually put it on  Ryotaro: 🤥😂
A rather improved Ryotaro! Man I love this community.
Metal Gear Solid 6: Pork Tactics
Probably the porky tactics,nice vids have fun doing them they amaze me and give ideas for the stuff i might do while visiting Japan.
Drunk Ryotaro is the best Ryotaro!!!!
Ryotaro is perfect as a supporting host, not a primary one, as he is trying hard with his channel
It'd be interesting if they had like a tonkotsu burger or smth
#AskAbroad Japan.
I've been subscribed since shortly before "Catshit One". Congrats on the 2mil! Now, you shithead, I'm hungry, from watching your video, and I've already had lunch. Time to go looking for some tonkatsu, I suppose...
drunk Ryotaro hits different
Don't brake the camera with that....nose !! :-D I envy you that 2 Million subscribers !! I am going to celebrate my 500 subscribers with instant noodle soup lol
Did u know us who "save the best for last" (me too) have a bit of a selfvalue problem.  cuz if u save the best for last you eat  the "WORST bit" all the time  but if u start with the best,  and eat yourself  forward to the worst part- you always eat the BEST one.  Mindblowing... isnt it. I know it.  Still dont do it- teamselfhate
You can tell ryotaro had a lot of fun with all the sake today
why does chris looks extra fat while drinking water
“Kampai he he he”
The best thing was seeing Ryotaro again. 🙃
Highly recommend warm sake, it's delicious!
Drunk Ryotaro is adorable. XD Congrats on 2 mil! I've been following for a few years now I believe.
I don’t drink alcohol but love ryokan! I watch all the videos where they are featured
I think ryotaro is always drunk 😂
10:33 I see Chris has somehow wound up in Half-Life: Ryokan
Chris devoting 80% of his channel to eating meat is what satisfies my cravings enough to keep me a vegetarian.
Nice video. Most basic comment I have ever written but yeah... nice video
Ryotaro physically struggles with literally everything when hes drunk
"Pork Tactics" should automatically earn a chapter in Sun Tzu's "The Art of War."
Greetings from Germany to Ryotaro :)
I'm curious on how much that pork Tonkatsu cost. Looked like such a fantastic meal.
Everytime I watch these videos- I feel like I am there at the table with you and Ryotaro and am shurly not bored. Laughing away with you two is so much fun. Hopefully I can visit Japan one day.. and who knows.. maybe even live there. Congratulations on 2m Subscribers Chris Bored! ... don't know who this Broad guy is.
Congratulations mate I've been watching your videos for the last two years or so and it makes me happy to see your channel grow like this, still waiting for Natsuki The Movie 2 ... have a good year mate.
👺
3:37 I don't think drinking the water from that river is clean or safe think of the mud
Drunk Ryotaro is best Ryotaro.
13:13 is peak ryotaro
Drinking untreated water from an open stream is just *begging* for dysentery!
Ryotaro <3
What does Ryotaro do for a living btw? Curious to know!
great broad
Ah yes, the adventures of Chris Board and his friend, the Nemperor.
This new Metal Gear Solid: Pork Tactics game is confusing. The golf cart cutscene was nice tho
That Tonkatsu looked really nice.
damn dude i really love the vid thanks for sharing this with us and finnally an episode with risottoro again <3
Loving this upload frequency
great as always
6:30 That’s just a thick Schnitzel
I guess your videos get a lot of views in part because of the high production quality, mostly done by you. Great work Chris! お疲れ様でした
Another video?! Praise to drunk Ryotaro, also known as Risottoro
One of the best eps by far. The chemistry is real here
we need full episode while Ryotaro wandering around  drunk af
Please get Ryotoro drunk for every video from now on :D :D :D
No offence! But Ryotro is always trying so hard that I can’t stand it/him
2 uploads in a single week?! We're really being spoiled aren't we
Congratulations on 2 mil subscribers Board!
Hello
These dates are getting out of hand, Chris. Your sugar daddy is sure treating you right!
Woah, they didn't even touch the salad, but ate the meat at a speed of light.
Wait, I just realised Tenga is named after Tengu and is reflected in the shape of his nose.
Deer, Boar, Bear....
Ryotoro's sound effects when dipping the pork 😂 tsu tsu tsu... Priceless 👌
From the producers of “Dave in Japan” and “chad”.... comes “CHRIS BOARD”, tune in for more adventures of mr. abroad’s evil clones
Great job!
are you dating Ryotoro? Chris Broad?
I personally think that drunk Ryotaro is best Ryotaro!
👺
i really shouldn’t watch these kinds of videos when i’m hungry and desperately missing japan 😭
Two videos in one week? Prolific.
Finally, a water review we never knew we needed in our lives.
Gotta love Aboard in japan
Love your channel bro 🇵🇷
CHRIS BOARD!!
Love your video chris. when will you bring CDawgVA for a collab? Since the two of you love shoving food in your face. haha.
Chris, you need to lay off the food or you'll become V.I.P de BIG 😳
Ryotoro getting plastered is exactly what I needed
Abroad in Japan notification is the best possible notification that you can get on youtube
My favorite couple from youtube!
I can definitely tell a difference with the 4K. Thank you!
Thank you for the amazing camera and amazingly fast upload time.
I like the video when you get drunk 😵 🍻
Chris ate all the pork leaving the vegetables. Well done!
I assure you, we don't drink beer all day in Germany. :D   Although, it has probably become more in the last year. -_-
Urodaki has been alive all this time. He is now ryotarou
Reyotoro was wasted
That tonkatsu looked incredible!!!!
Damn, two videos in one week!! Thanks Chris
Two videos in a matter of days!? Your spoiling us
Congrats on 2 million subscribers! Crazy how far a man named Dave can come with nothing more than a greenscreen and an apartment in Seattle
I would like to know for Muslims, where could we find non-alcohol and/or Pork added dishes?
Nothing quite like a video of Chris lowkey bullying Ryotaro ✌🏽😭
Are we not going to talk about the fact that you should NEVER drink water straight from a source? Please make sure that its properly filtered and disinfected. You can get incredibly sick from this.
Was great to finally find out after all those fat comments, that you are in better shape than the lads at Trash Taste 🤣
The sake tasting and drinking by the water were my fav parts 😂 I'd love to go to a place like this
Two videos in a week?!!? WHAT? Sunday is fun again...
Slow down the playback speed to 0.25, and you can actually see Ryotoro's life leave his body when Chris says "Your videos tend to get less views."
'im not going to give you any more beef' then moves to the shot of the room where he looks like he's definitely going to try and slip that beef in later in the night.
The owner gives major Daimyo vibes, especially when he was sitting on a higher spot beside Ryotaro!
Thanks to your videos, we're able to experience all these different parts of Japan through your eyes. Thank you Chris and congratulations on 2 million subscribers!
Is this Abroad in Japan's first Gunma video? Finally filling up the map of the greater Kanto area.
I remember this from the Instagram Livestream you both did but i really wanted to see how the outside view looked at night. This was pretty interesting, but whenever i see some of the food you open my appetite instantly.
The only reason I watch is for Ryotaro. 🤣
Ryotaro's facemask looks like a blobfish 🤣
Two videos in one week?? Chris has blessed us
My grandpa who used to work in Japan every summer had a photo taken with him and a guy fully clothed to that red devil looking thing you showed in the beginning and that photo used to scare the fuck out of 3 year old me i remember!
Damn, that tonkatsu... might have to add Gunma to my list of places to visit! Not that I'd give that sukiyaki a pass. Or the sake!
Congrats!
I want to get drunk in a forest and pretend I'm in a metal music video.
chris, the 4k looks epic.
@2:29 LOL
"I'm not gonna give you any more BEEF" is my new favorite Ryotaro quote.
Do your think Natski gets jealous of Ryotaro?
Image quality on another level this episode chris keep it up
It must be very difficult to cut the scenes into pieces. Such awesome locations and events. I would love to see that craft by Chris. Maybe in his second channel, Abroad Perspective.
👺
Guten Tag
Risottaro bringing that amazing drunken energy to this video is pure ✨magic✨ This video feels like I'm on a trip with you guys, love the vibe.
Great! Congratulations Chris.  My favourite YouTuber ever!  がんばって ! ! !   クリスは私のお気に入りの英国人です。
Sake for sure.
Amazing content as always 😊
Getting drunk in forest on a sake adventure is a new life goal for me.
I love how every time I'm watching your videos, it always feels like I'm watching a movie. Congratulations on the 2 million Chris!
I LOVE TENGU!!!!
Two uploads in one week? You're absolutely spoiling us, Chris. Please don't stop.
Chris and Ryotaro need to start a restaurant named Pork Tactics. 😆
Can confirm, I only sub for Ryotaro.
“This feels like an opening to a video game”  Grand Theft Ryotaro
Inject that tonkatsu directly into my veins.
7:45 Pork could also be referring to Sexual intercourse, that's why it sounds weird 😂
MASSIVE 😉
Congratulations on 2 million subscribers!!! Happy to be one of them! I never realized Chris was left handed. Does Ryataro speak German?
I didn't expect to see drinking of nature water from a fancy glass lol. It looks like fun riding a self-driving cart! Why do they use sardine as chopstick rests in the inn though? The tonkatsu looked delicious! It's making me hungry...
The quality of your videos have surpassed that of most modern day documentaries imo. Well done Chris. “Heavenly.”
I love these videos so much. They feed my aspirations in life. Thank you.
The chemistry between Ryotoro and Chris
A board in a pan - an idea for a still life picture.
Hi chris, can you heart my comment? would make my day better <3
OwO
Can I use "Pork Tactics"  on any kind of pork, or does it have to be breaded?
Now to another episode of: Chris intimidates japanese citizens with his abhrasive accent
Two million subscribers, I still remember when I subscribed and we were only 1,8 million. Time flies
Let's just appreciate how far Chris has come from tasting edamame beans. He can even describe the taste of water.
Great video! Your camera work is getting better and better with each video keep up the great work 👍🔥!!!
Today, I learned: Chris is left-handed, like me. I'm one step closer to secretly replacing him and taking over his life. Only an uncountably high number of steps left to go.
Ryotoro's English has come along so much, it's brilliant.
That pork is thicc
Pork tactic 🤣
2 videos in a week what the fuck is happening
Your trashed Japanese friend is very funny.  Nice video.
Pork Tactics.. that's gonna be in my dictionary
Ryotaro getting progressively more drunk as the video goes on gives me life
Those masks.....that is the stuff nightmares are made of.....
Notification squad!!!
Seeing Ryatoro drunk made my day
I thought the tengu nose would pop out of the video and poke me in the eye...   I must say the videos quality is amazing.
The next Journey should include surfing destinations. Journey Across Japan 4: Aboard in Japan.
Love the videos and the work you put into them, Definitely going to have to something similar with my father once travel restrictions are lifted and able to leave. Keep up the good work  and do you plan on doing any more documentary videos really enjoyed the last one?
You know what would be really funny. If Natski made a YT channel and he actually gets more views/subs than Riottero; wanna see Chris's reaction to that haha.
10:33 Hey! You're finally awake!
Love your videos so much thank you for the travel ideas I've been watching you for years
Hey Chris, just want to appreciate the BG music choice for the vide 👍❤️
Slightly drunk Ryotaro is a national treasure. Seriously I was laughing all throughout the vid, maybe try to slightly inebriate Ryotaro first before letting him appear in a vid from now on lol.
Congrats to the 2 mio viewers, it is well deserved! And Risottoro was definitely a part of it. For me the best part today was that Monster Schnitzel you call Tonkatsu! That said,  I am still looking forward to "Journey across Japan: Escape to the sea"... ;)
i really ilke that fake taxi spin off you did in that automatic car, this is 2021 for you guys
Bro, you need to drop that Ryoto, or whatever the f*ck his name is.  So annoying, makes me want to unsubscribe.
Crisp Rod and Rissotoro back at it again on the sake drinking, meat eating adventure
Was kind of hoping, as Chris asked for a "one word description", Ryotoro would say "just as/justice delicious" 😁
where in tokyo would a big guy go to buy clothes? i know in general japanese people are tiny, i’m an american 2X and i’m 6 foot 3, where would somebody my size go to find clothes in tokyo?
Congrats
Pork tactics sound a lot like pork-tastic :D
God, I love Ryotaro. Thanks for making me laugh!
2 videos in one week... I’m loving this Chris
I think around the Pork Tactics part, Chris was starting to get boozey eyes 👀
Pretty awesome, I'll definitely look into that hotel if I ever can. It looks like a comfortable stay! Congrats on 2 mil!  Have you ever considered doing a video on the arcade /game center scenes in Japan? Would love to see the spin you put in your videos into something like that. (unless arcades aren't your thing of course)  Keep up the great videos man. Your videos  helped me before I went to visit Japan. Hopefully will head back soon.
When I visit Gunma I want to try Ryotaro.
Lord Drunkotaro destroying doors with Saké is the highlight for me
Holy hell, that Ryokan is huge
What a way to start my day.
Can ryotaro please be drunk in all your videos? He's so much more palatable!
No you have won in life Chris.
So you get in an acient log bath with Joey but not in an onsen with Ryotaro?
Oh my god Youtube actually sent me a notification about a new video today.
Drunk Ryotaro is how I act sober
Man drinking from a river in the middle of the forest is a testament to Japan's respect for nature.
Congrats on 2 mil!
Trash taste bois: Suffering, backstabbing each other and cheating in this week cycling episode. Chris: enjoy life in a fancy 250$ room, drink sake next to a beautiful river and his nemesis didn't plan to kill him this time. Life can be so unfair sometime lmao
Watches Chris eat really expensive well made food. Time for a packet of crisps then.
Stunningly beautiful!    And Mmmeeaat!  Perfection 🍷 And Ryotoro, these subs are ALL Chris baby!
happy two mill
Needs more drunk rissotoro
Ryotaro and my mother act the same when they are drunk
Very disappointed Ryotaro didn't keep the mask on during dinner.
12:03 "Bathroom??? Oh my god" Never have I ever seen anyone so excited to see a bathroom before, Ryotaro strikes again.
Wow , Ryotaro has 2 mil subs congrats maybe Chris will get there one day
Finally, a use for this emoji: 👺
This Duo is so amazing ! The humour that this relation bring is amazing in video ! BIG Congratulations Chris for hitting that 2M subs! Looking forward to see some of your amazing content as always!
100% want to try some sake, sending good wishes from Staffordshire.
Alternate Title "A British Guy who speaks Japanese and a Japanese guy who speaks English Get Drunk all Day" 😂
We rarely see Chris show off his Japanese, so it was really fun and motivating to see him use it for once. More Japanese from you Chris! Keep up the good work.
Even as a Tengu Risottoro failed his assassination attempt!
Drunk Ryotaro is best Ryotaro honestly
Think I will go to this place next time I’m in Japan 🇯🇵
Final Fantasy Pork Tactics
As a german without drinking rituals i am somewhat triggered by the teasing that chris ist drinking a weizen but we never actually see him do it 😬 Also no Weizenglass which is against our non existant drinking rituals 😥
This channel is literal gold
Drunk Ryotaro is the BEST RYOTARO
Chris and Ryotaro are the perfect pairing for these types of videos. Congrats on 2 million subs!
Congrats on 2 Million! 👺👺👺
2million subscriber special: Chris “board” and drunk Ryotaro take on pork tactics. Simply... chaotic
GG
Kawaii and Kampai sound pretty similar. Coincidence? I think not.
Thanks for the inspiration to visit Japan outside the usual mainstream touristic spots (Tokyo/Kyoto/Osaka).
Woow, would love to go to china someday
Drunk Ryotaro tho 😂
2 videos in a week!?? Chris what have you become!??
After hearing the phrase "pork tactics" my life will never be the same 🤣🐷
One of the best episodes, so chilled out and I laughed a few times. Keep up the good work and congratulations on 2 mil subscribers, you deserve it.  Maybe one day I will go to such a place in Japan, guess its a goal now.
Yep, Japan is beautiful, I'll definitely go there for some time
Gotta love how Ryotaro said don't sit to the left of a left-handed person and then did it again at the next restaurant
What japanese words do you think is the most hardest to translate in english?
This video should be called "Riottoro stole my video"
my neighbor Ryotaro IS THE BEST
Keep the content coming both Chris and Ryotoro! I have discovered so many YouTube channels all with excellent content thanks to Chris so cheers dude 👌
Having Ryotaro in these videos is always a nice addition.
I wonder how much of a Weizen this Weizen at 17:40 actually is
Congrats on 2 Mio. subs, keep up the great work. After abroad in Japan and Abroad Perspective, a board in Japan gonna be the 3rd Channel 😆
I truly love this channel I need to go to Japan already haha
my neighbor Ryotaro is the best.
WOAH 750 likes no dislikes. inoncievable
Dave and Risottaro!  Name a better duo!
Is it bad that when they mentioned that they were in Gunma my first thought was Initial D
A drink Ryotaro is one of the most fascinating things I've seen.
Saki  by the stream and the Inn you stayed at.
No ads :o is it really demonitized???
And now I wanna eat tonkatsu while drinking sake at a forest...
Ryotaro is the main character 😂
I didn't wake up expecting to see a drunk Ryotoro singing show tunes.... But now that I have I wouldn't have it any other way 😂
More drunk Risottoro!! Keep up the awesome videos Chris, love the content!
👺
Congrats to 2 million viewers Chris!  Living vicariously through you till I can travel to Japan again!
8:48   minus 48 degrees Celsius
Congratulations!!!
Holy shit 2 abroad in Japan videos with less than 5 days wtf this is a great thing to have happen
We got a treat, two videos within a week. Really enjoyable, thanks!
finally u are again satisfying my addiction chris! <3 Not gonna lie, what i loved the most where firstly when u drank in the forest at the spring and secondly the view from the balcony. 10/10 i would love to be there for once as well. best regards from germany
I totally agree, Japanese people definitely open up more when drunk and are loud, it’s almost like they are a different person. Then the next day you meet them they are back to silence and very calm. Lol
sharla and chris droppin on the same day alright alright alright
Best thing: Ryotaro being drunk
Drunk Risottoro is the best version of Risottoro we've ever seen
congrats
2 videos in a single week? I think Chris is sick guys. lol
Watching your journey has been amazing, every video your editing seems better and better. Easily my favourite youtube channel. Spent the day at work yesterday rewatching your cycle across japan. Never gets old
I didn't like Chris performance in this video, he was very C O L D ..
Not even half way through the video and they already had one too many 😂
What $250 gets you at a Japanese hot spring is a drunken Ryotaro
Well well well...would you look at that. Sardines DO serve a purpose.
They give you a huge amount of food when you order that pork.
Drinking water from a stream without boiling it, my survival instincts are screaming STOP
Drunk Ryotaro is best Ryotaro.
Congratulations on hitting two million subscribers Chris, very much deserved.
Beautiful Inn! I was wondering is Natto something you find often in those traditional inns? Or any other rather special foods? Is it possible to adjust food? Like for lactose intolerant/ vegan people?
It gets you a mildly impressed Brit
Demonitized? No, Chris, "Demonized"!
I love Ryotaro’s second channel!
Every new abroad in Japan video i treat it like the final sip of wine.
10:33 Half Life?
Not sure how to handle this rate of uploads.
That Tonkatsu looked Porktastic..... I'm sorry.
Normal Ryotaro is funny. Drunk Ryotaro is hilarious.
helo...
Greetings from Costa Rica, a nice video to enjoy in a warm weather. Cheers!
Well I guess I am not sleeping then
Yet more places to visit when I finally get to Japan. The Chris Broad tour. And that Tonkatsu looked amazing....
For some reason I love the bit drunk Ryotaro :3
another amazing video Chris. that tonkatsu looked incredible.
Chris: "2 million sub!" Ryotaro: "They sub for me." Me: *Patiently waiting for more Natsuki.*
WAIT A SECOND chris is left handed? Unbsubscribed               D:
I love ryotro and positive energy he gives
Yes, I subscribed because of Ryotaro and Natsuki 😂
Love the Tengu ❤
Drunk ryotaro is scary, be careful Chris.
Hey Chris, Just wanted to say thank you for the amazing videos. Every time you upload a video it brightens my day. Also, I always watch all the advertisements on your videos because I can't afford to support through Patreon at the moment so I figure letting the ADs run fully is my way of giving some support..... Except for that one time there was an ELEVEN minute advertisement for some business software - i couldn't stand it and skipped after 5 minutes of torture lol
What non-brits don't really understand is the act of "taking the piss" out of someone (aka, making fun of someone to their face) really just means you feel comfortable enough to consider them really close friends... either that or you're drunk enough to get into a fight as a signal to your friends you're ready to move on 🤣🤷‍♂️
Chris + Ryoutoro + Natsuki + Anime man = best video ever!
Notification squad!
*Congratulations on reaching 2 million subscribers Chris!!!* You totally deserved it!! Your videos are super interesting, highly entertaining and perfectly edited, which imo makes your channel one of the best YT channels ever. Keep up the good work, a huge thanks from Italy!!
The views you capture from the countryside are so beautiful.
Two videos in one week!? 🔥
when's the next video with natsuki coming????????
You’re not sleeping at 4?! Arigatō for the new video!
$250 in a Japanese Hot Spring In gets you my disdain, jealousy, and my cafe au lait that's 75% milk.
He actually can speak japanese?
Tune in for Abroad In A Pan: Pork Tactics Special 😂
I’m a simple lass, I see Chris upload, I abandon everything else I’m doing no matter what
Whoa. That water scene, that is pure luxury. I must visit and taste this fresh flowing water. Amazing.
This right here....is some good  ******
Wow, getting 2 videos in 3 days is unheard of, you're spoiling us
Lol I hope this doesn't get de monetized
Can we get a "pork tactics" shirt?
👺
Great video always nice to have ryotaro
It's hard finding those tengu masks to buy
Drunk Risottoro is Best Risottoro
Hahah I love slightly drunk Ryotoro!!
Why have we been blessed like this
Wait. Chris is left handed?!? I stand with you in solidarity in our cack-handedness.
I kept the adverts running while I rolled a spliff so you get paid. You're welcome.
Always fun to watch your show!
Ryotaro: Out of the 2mil subscribers 1.5 are on me! Chris: Hmm? No. Natsuki: Fools. Dave: Haha.
Am I the first to comment?
$250 will get you a Risottaro transform into a Hoettaro.... maybe.... bugger
Fuck yeah love you and your videos.
👺Let's go
Sekiro
We have been to Japan 5 times mainly based round Hiroshima I lived there for 5 years can't wait to get back
Two abroad in japan videos in a week? I remember when I joined around 2018 when a new video was further away than the end of lockdowns.
Woah two videos in one such a short time whats up with this?
It must be a load of work getting all those camera shots done, not to mention the physical discomfort and inconvenience. Thank you for putting the effort in.
Beef
PORK TACTICS
Two million subs well earned my good sir! I love to see such dedication and hard work paying off, and I hope this paves the way to bigger and better things for you and the channel. Alas, I have no sake to toast you with, so instead I will raise a can of flat diet Coke to your health and success. Cheers from the UK you magnificant bastard, and here's to another eight million subs well on the way.
Nice.... 👍
Remind me to NEVER drink Nagai Sake if they use water directly from an outdoor spring.  Hello parasitic infections.
Hear me out, new Mizubasho slogan  "Mizubasho: Like a magic in every sip"
This is too amazing. Did you use the "GoTo" coupons?
Here I'm, in a lockdown in Portugal, and Chris traveling across Japan... Don't know if I hate you or love you for keeping me sane. One thing is for sure, don't stop making quality videos.
Tengu likes the tenga 👺
I want to go to Japan so badlyyyyyy...
SOGEKING IS THAT YOUU!!? 0:16
Was 1k like😁
2 VIDEOS IN THE SAME WEEK
6:26 Cooking with Chris
Oddly, I never noticed Chris was left handed until now!😄
Japan!!! Why are you soooo far awayyy 😭
I expect "What hitmen could you theoretically you hire for $50 in Japan" with a suspicious lack of Ryotaro and a jubilant Chris a few months from now.
Congrats on 2m! :)
A new episode so soon? Hell yeah!
look goood with that mask on ryotatoro!!
That mask at the start reminded me of the sword maker in demon slayer..... HAHAHA it made me laugh
I don't like Tengu's, they are dick heads
I was very tired and for some reason I thought it was a river of sake I didn't even question it because... it's Japan
One word, “heavenly”. Lol!
I would love to see a 4k wallpaper library for desktops from you chris, All your shots of the countryside are amazing.
Omg its abroad in a pan and the ancient god of noses
please share the video, Chris deserve it
Pork tactics
Chris Broad! Congrats on 2 mil subs!!!! It's crazyyyy to have been a fan so long and see your channel continue to grow and "mature" :p. You are by far my favorite YouTuber so keep it up, lad! <3
how very unusual from Chris uploading twice a week !! what a treat
NOT U POSTING TWICE IN A WEEK 😂
Welp adding this to the list when I go back to Japan
Ah, it is very late in Japan you know! You may finally go to sleep kind sir, than you for the content!  Finally we get to see  the REAL gem of the channel, Ryotaro!
3:00 “who wouldn’t wanna get drunk in a forest?” perfect for a billboard Chris.
Congrats on the 2M subs Chris! Thank you for your amazing videos, and for the fact that you made my 2019 trip to Japan so much easier and more enjoyable! ♥
3:35 anyone notice how often Chris says the word “surreal”? I’ve heard it so many times on the podcast that I can’t not notice it now
Didn’t get my notification!!
I was going to watch this, but jfc, I'm gonna get so damn hungry if I watch it now, better to come back tomorrow... after I've eaten and I might fare a bit better....
2 videos in 1 week.... am I still dreaming??
A quick upload........hmmmm surprising
That water looks おいしいね
as A Sekiro fan I immediately Recognized The Tengu Mask
Oh my you guys drank the water directly from the spring? 🤣🤣🤣🤣
So Dave has started to upload more videos. Amazing job Dave.  Also, I couldn't imagine Rissotoro could look scarier than he already is
Nobody : Chris : i'mma upload my new video on 4 am [JPN time]
Nobody: Not a single soul: Ryotaro:👺👺
Do ryoutaro videos actually get lower views? Those are the best ones
Imagine going somewhere to have fun.  Just to go there and see a a Tengu and get your video demonetized before it's even begun.
the roasting between you two never gets old. keep up the great work! congrats on 2m!
What a treat; 2 videos in a week!
Uwow, what’s with the frequent upload, Chris? You’re overdosed with chicken cuts or something?
Why am I getting Jurassic Park vibes?! 0:51 I spared no expense...
Two uploads within a week?! Preposterous!  Dave, if you're being held hostage by Risottaro, blink twice in the next video.
chris bod
Damn, two videos so fast one after the other. We are truly blessed
I'm starting to think Ryotaro is immortal.
I've seen a lot from Japan, but a hotel so large it needs a self driving cart was not something I could have imagined. Keep surprising me, Japan!
Hi
Most of the inns that I see online are booked out to kingdom come what feels like 2 years in advance. Any secret tips or places you'd recommend to look at in order to find this type of place in this type of price range? (others with availability seem to be 600-700$+...)
gosh
Congratulations on  2 million!!!!!!
Y'all's banter between you two always cracks me up
This was so exciting to make the ground itself had a little boogie after it was filmed
Death, taxes, Chris consuming his body weight in meat. Love it.
Looks like we are early...
9 views cool thats the fastest ive joined a new video
Chris is on a roll. Do not expect so much constant content from him
2 minutes 126 comments
Good I needed content... I just sit down for... Nevermind.
here at 9 views for once and still there are 100 comments and 300 likes before me lol
my bucket list is getting far too long thanks to you Chris
Ryotaro isn’t quite that scary.
What the heck are you doing releasing this video so late in Japan? Pretty sure you stayed up all night finishing the damn video. But honestly thanks for that sacrifice, I really enjoy all your content 😁
Therapist: Ryotengu doesn't exist, it can't hurt you Ryotengu: 0:18  That is my sleep paralysis demon
NOTIFICATION SQUAD: Don't deny it. You wanted to see Ryotaro get run over by the patronisingly slow self-driving cart as much as I did. A MASSIVE thank you to you all for tuning into the Abroad in Japan channel - whether you're new here and are still wondering who the hell we are, or have been watching since the dawn of time (which is 2012). I never thought we'd make it this far and I'm hoping we can do something extra special in 2021! Bring on some serious "pork tactics." (Seriously though, how does Ryotaro invent these phrases?!).
EPIC
Thumbnail with food in it, Chris knows how to attract viewers
"demonetized before it's even begun." Love your channel bro
Ma boi Chris who's abroad in Japan, increasing his upload schedule. That's something I like!
Congratulations for 2M subs Chris👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Congratulations 🎈🍾🎊🎉

250 dollars eh, I would rather spend it all on fast food in Japan because I have trash taste.     Jk
I love the relation you and ryotaro have😂
Chris on overtime and Ryotaro helping him?
Food 🍲 is good 👍

Can’t have a Chris and Ryotaro collab without any tasty food being eaten!

0:14 POV: You’re being robbed
It will get you out of your house lol
$250 can reward you nature’s best gift.
